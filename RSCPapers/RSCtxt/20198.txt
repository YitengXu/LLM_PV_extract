These oxidants are accessed from the reaction of ketones with an oxidant and are employed stoichiometrically or catalytically (in situ) for numerous transformations such as oxidations, epoxidations, C–H hydroxylation, etc. The oxidations involve a broad spectrum of substrates such as alcohols, amines, phenols, silanes, phosphines, etc. Similarly, the epoxidation of olefins, alkynes, allenes and arenes is achieved efficiently, where alkene epoxidation can be regioselective, chemoselective, stereoselective, and stereospecific. Furthermore, C–H hydroxylation using dioxiranes proceeds in both an inter- and intramolecular fashion producing a variety of potent molecules that are difficult to access using other means. Dioxiranes are used for the synthesis of various natural products, drugs, and biomolecules. This review covers all the aforementioned aspects of dioxirane chemistry along with the historical development, characteristics, and reaction mechanisms of dioxirane-mediated transformations established over the last five decades.Tarek El-AssaadTarek H.

1. Introduction
Dioxiranes are heterocyclic organic peroxides in which a three-membered ring is comprised of one carbon and two oxygen atoms.1 They are isomeric with the well-known carbonyl oxides. Dioxiranes are excellent oxygen transfer reagents in the arsenal of the organic chemist and are highly attractive due to their mild nature and high selectivity. Furthermore, catalytic and recyclability attributes have rendered these reagents highly useful for materials synthesis. Synthetic applications of dioxiranes are numerous and well explored for both achiral and asymmetric transformations including novel C–H oxygenations.2 Dioxirane-mediated oxygen transfer reactions are superior to metal-mediated reactions2 in terms of safety and environmental impact.
The most commonly used dioxirane species for performing synthesis, dimethyl dioxirane, popularly known as DMDO or Murray's reagent, is easily accessed from readily available commercial materials.3 Acetone is the by-product of the reduction of DMDO, which is not considered environmentally hazardous at the moment.2 In recent years, methyl(trifluoromethyl)-dioxirane (TFDO), developed by Mello et al. in 1988,4 has become popular due to its superior reactivity, unique selectivity, and equally facile preparation. TFDO demonstrates great potential in terms of functionalization, activation, and catalysis of biologically or chemically significant compounds, and has gained the status of one of the most widely used dioxiranes alongside DMDO.5 TFDO is considered the most reactive among dioxiranes.6
Recent advances in high-level computational chemistry have offered significant insights into the mechanistic aspects of dioxirane reactivity,7,8 prediction and assignment of spectroscopic data,9 transition state character, and elucidation of mechanisms.10 The continuous exploration of dioxirane chemistry over the last five decades has rendered it one of the most popular reagents in the hands of chemists for various organic transformations.11 Some of the pioneering literature reviews of this field include Murray et al. (1989),12 Adam et al. (1989),13 Curci et al. (1995 and 2006).14,15 Shi et al. (2004),16 and Yang et al. (2004).17 An updated survey of scientific progress including pioneering developments is essential for further growth of this research area. Although a significant number of reviews are available,2,18–20 the present review is a compiled collection of research done in the area that covers all aspects of dioxirane-mediated chemistry.
2. Historical background
In 1899, Baeyer and Villiger suggested the formation of dioxirane intermediate 2 during the transformation of menthone (1) into lactone 3; the reaction is popularly known as the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation (BVO) (Scheme 1).21 Here, the oxidation was performed using K2S2O8 in the presence of a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. In 1953 Doering and Dorfman proposed a different reaction path for the BVO that did not involve a dioxirane intermediate22 but a Criegee intermediate, which was supported by 18O-enriched mass-spectrometric studies.22–26 The Criegee intermediate is a carbonyl oxide having zwitterionic attributes.27–29

In 1972, Talbott and Thompson reported the first synthesis of the cyclic peroxides 4a–c, which can be shown as diradical 5 or zwitterionic 6–7, respectively (Scheme 2).30Ab initio calculations suggested the existence of a stable dioxirane species 4d, i.e., a methylene peroxide, in the gas phase, which was generated from the reaction between ozone (O3) and ethylene at low temperature (−190 °C).31,32 The formation of 4d was confirmed by microwave,33,34ab initio calculations,35 and mass spectrometry techniques.36 It is worth mentioning that the generation of 4d involving a mixture of ozone and ethylene is considered explosive.33,34

In 1974, Montgomery observed faster decomposition of KHSO5 in the presence of ketones like acetone, cyclohexanone, N,N-dimethyl-4-oxopiperidinium nitrate, etc.,37 compared to ketone-free reactions. In addition, the ketones facilitated the oxidation of chloride and an inorganic dye, namely Polar Brilliant Blue GAW, appreciably (Table 1).37

The marked similarity among the three reactions in Table 1 suggested the involvement of a common reactive intermediate. Accordingly, the initial step for all these reactions was believed to be the nucleophilic addition of KHSO5 to the carbonyl carbon to form adduct 8, which was analogous to 2-hydroxy-2-hydroperoxypropane observed in aqueous alkaline acetone solution of H2O2.38 At that time, dioxirane 9 (DMDO) was only a proposed intermediate based on its similarity to adduct 8 and no additional support was available for its existence.

  During the 1980s, dioxirane 9 was in situ generated by Murray3,12,39 from the reaction of Oxone® (2KHSO5·K2SO4·KHSO4) and acetone in acetone medium. In 1987, Adam et al. optimized Murray's initial method and prepared 9 on a larger scale.40,41 Similarly, methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane (TFDO, 10) was also prepared using 1,1,1-trifluoropropanone (TFP).4 The characterization and isolation of various dioxiranes are briefly discussed below.
2.1. Generation, isolation and characterization of dioxiranes
In 1979, Edwards et al. successfully developed a synthetic procedure for the in situ generation of dioxirane 9 from the reaction of acetone (11) and Oxone® in aqueous media at pH ∼ 7–8 (Scheme 3a).39 Here, KHSO5 (12) is the potassium salt of Caro's acid; its anions HSO5− and SO52− are called caroat/caroate.42 Notably, some research groups also denote 12 as caroate.42 This Oxone®–acetone system was explored for various 9-mediated catalytic oxidations like the stereospecific epoxidation of cis- and trans-cinnamic acids (13 and 15) to the corresponding cis- and trans-epoxides (14 and 16) (Scheme 3b and c), respectively, and the oxidation of p-tolyl phenyl sulfoxide 17 to sulfone 18 (Scheme 3d).39
 Scheme 3  
In situ generation of dioxirane 9 and its early applications.39 
Mechanistically, the reaction of caroate (12) with a ketone (19) purportedly proceeds through the rapid formation of a peroxo-adduct 20 (Scheme 4).38,43,44 Then, the acidic proton in 20 is readily deprotonated in a basic medium via rapid proton transfer to yield oxo-anion 22. Nucleophilic intramolecular attack of the alkoxide oxygen on the O–O bond produces dioxirane 4, which can either react with KHSO5 (12) to liberate oxygen gas (path a), or with any electron-rich substrate (path b) producing the oxidized product 23. Finally, the original ketone 19 is regenerated and continues the reaction cycle (Scheme 4).44
 Scheme 4  Plausible mechanism for dioxirane formation.39 
During the reaction, a negligible amount of BVO product 21a–b (Scheme 4, path c) was observed for most of the employed ketones, and this product became significant at higher pH (pH > 11). For example, a significant loss of ketone (15–30%) was observed for the cyclohexanone catalyst at pH 9,39 whereas the loss was much less at pH 7. Among various ketones, for cyclobutanone, path c became dominant to produce γ-butyrolactone predominantly.39
To obtain an insight into the reaction mechanism, Edwards and co-workers conducted 18O-label experiments. When doubly labelled caroate (KOSO218O18OH) was employed, dioxirane intermediate 4 was expected to contain 50% of the 18O-label oxygen on the dioxirane ring. Between the two symmetrically disposed oxygen atoms, one comes from 19 and the other from the doubly labelled caroate (Scheme 4).39 Thus, nucleophilic attack on 4 by a labelled caroate (path a) should produce oxygen gas with 75% of the 18O-label atoms, i.e., 18O–18O and 18O–O, respectively. When the liberated oxygen gas was analyzed, it contained 73 ± 2% of the 18O-label. Alternatively, only a small amount of 18O-label was found in 19 formed via step a. Eventually, when 18O-labeled ketone and unlabelled caroate were used, the oxygen gas evolved contained around 20% labelled oxygen, i.e., 18O–O and O–O, respectively.39 These findings supported the generation of a dioxirane species during the reaction.
In 1990, Edward and co-workers found that bis(trimethylsilyl)monoperoxysulfate (25, TMSOOSO3TMS) decomposed in the presence of ketones, which was used to probe dioxirane intermediacy.45 Previously in 1979, this CH2Cl2-soluble reagent 25 was explored by Adam and Rodriguez for the BVO of ketones to esters/lactones (21a–b) (Scheme 5a).46 These ester/lactone products were analyzed by mass spectrometry using doubly 18O-labelled 27, i.e., TMS18O18OSO3TMS.45 The carbonyl (CO) or the ether (OC–O) oxygen of the esters/lactones (21a and 21b, respectively) were enriched with 18O-labelled atoms (Scheme 5b), consistent with the reaction proceeding through a purported dioxirane intermediate. Furthermore, the decomposition of 27 with unlabelled caroate produced oxygen gas and its analysis for l8O-content also supported dioxirane intermediacy.45
 Scheme 5  Conversion of a ketone into an ester via Baeyer–Villiger oxidation.45,46 
Kinetic studies were performed by Edwards et al.39 on ketone-mediated caroate decomposition. The relative rates for various cyclic ketones were found to be: cyclopentanone (0.02) < cyclohexanone (1.0) > cycloheptanone (0.04). Interestingly, the trend was similar to that of NaBH4 mediated reduction of cycloalkanone, i.e., cyclopentanone (0.07) < cyclohexanone (1.0) > cycloheptanone (0.01).47 Thus, it is likely that the reaction with the ketone–Oxone® system transits through sp2 to sp3 hybridization and produces adducts 20 and 22, respectively (Scheme 4). These adducts are further converted into the reactive dioxirane intermediates 4. Hence, the kinetic studies supported the labelling experiments and generation of a dioxirane intermediate having a ring structure.39 This kinetic study further rules out the generation of any oxonium species or ylides, i.e., carbonyl oxides 34 (Scheme 6).
 Scheme 6  Generation and isomerization of carbonyl oxides and dioxiranes.52 
Formic acid (32), methylenebis(oxy) (5–7), Criegee intermediates 31 and dioxirane 4d were further studied and compared by theoretical calculations (vide infra).48 In 2014, Li et al. studied the R0-vibrational level of the simplest Criegee intermediates, i.e., H2COO.48 In 2016, the same group analyzed the full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PES) and dipole moment surfaces of dioxiranes 4d with ab initio calculations. Here, the R0-vibrational levels calculated for variously labelled dioxiranes D/13C/18O-labelling) based on PES were compared with the known experimental microwave spectra. The values were quite similar and they allowed the prediction of the IR spectra of various dioxiranes.9 Also in 2018, a complex ab initio quantum chemistry calculation by Li et al. with CASPT2 and CASSCF trajectory surface hopping elucidated a photoisomerization pathway in the transformation of the Criegee intermediate into dioxirane.49 It was previously established that, upon UV excitation, Criegee intermediate 31 underwent O–O cleavage.50 Li and co-workers suggested the degradation of 4d into formaldehyde and oxygen via a unimolecular O–O bond cleavage with minimal change in the C–O bond length.49 The claim was substantiated by the fact that in the ground state the simplest Criegee intermediate (H2COO) was more zwitterionic (6, 7, R1 = R2 = H), specifically due to a short C–O bond and elevated CO bond character. Alternatively, for diradical dioxirane 5 (R1 = R2 = H), similar C–O and O–O bond lengths were expected.51 With rotation of the C–O bond, the resulting out-of-plane conformation would activate an isomerization pathway to dioxirane, as indicated by a potential energy funnel, whereas the dissociation pathway would prevail when the molecule was in the plane.49

  Notably, the elevated CO character also indicated the possibility of carbonyl oxide 34 instead of/along with dioxirane.29 It is challenging to differentiate between dioxirane 4 and carbonyl oxide 34 (Scheme 6).52 Formation of oxidant 34 is well known;53 this is readily synthesized from ketone 19via carbene intermediacy. The steps involved are an initial preparation of diazo-alkane 33,54,55 which gives 34 upon treatment with singlet oxygen.52,56–59 Notably, 34 is a nucleophilic oxidant that attacks through its alkoxide oxygen atom. Thus, to differentiate the structural isomers dioxirane 4 and carbonyl oxide 34 based on nucleophilicity,52 various experiments have been conducted.
In 1987, Adam et al. analyzed dioxiranes 4d and 9 through NMR spectroscopy and ab initio calculations.40 Here, an acetone solution of 9 was prepared from the reaction of 12 and acetone in buffer solutions, and further used for spectroscopic analysis. Dioxirane 4d was very unstable, decomposing at −60 °C,33,34 whereas the acetone solution of 9 (yellow color) was stable at room temperature and could be stored in the freezer (ca. −20 °C) for weeks. Eventually, the stability of the latter allowed characterization studies using NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, dioxirane 9 exhibited a 13C resonance at 102.30 ppm. Such a signal is not consistent with a deshielded carbonyl carbon such as in 34, but rather is a signature of a gem-dioxy (acetal) carbon (cf.4–7). The acetal species40 was also supported by ab initio calculations. According to ab initio calculations, gem-dimethyl substitution was responsible for imparting thermodynamic as well as kinetic stability to the strained cyclic peroxide 9.40 However, when solutions of 9 were irradiated with UV light for spectroscopic studies, the dioxirane content decomposed completely within ∼7 h at room temperature.
The decomposition of 9 by UV-light treatment was further studied by Kirschfeld in 1994, through which pure dioxirane 37 with sterically hindered mesityl groups was synthesized and isolated in both solution and pure form.60 When dimesityldiazomethane (35) in CFCl3/(CF2Br)2 was saturated with O2 and cooled to −196 °C (77 K), it became a transparent glass.61 Upon irradiation (>515 nm) the glass exhibited an intense and broad absorption at 398 nm indicating oxide 40 (Scheme 7b).62 Upon warming to −78 °C (195 K), the yellow color of the carbonyl oxide 40 mixture persisted for several hours. However, the color dissipated within a few minutes when the solution was warmed to −30 °C. Oxide 40 was photolabile and apparently decomposed upon irradiation (>475 nm). Here, irradiation of 35 gave mainly three products: dimesitylketone 36 (9%), mesityl mesitoate 38 (23%), and dimesityldioxirane 37 (55%) (Scheme 7a).60 Dioxirane 37 exhibited a signal for 13C resonance (∼103 ppm), a value similar to that observed previously by Adam et al.40 as the dioxirane peak for 9. In addition, dioxirane 37 slowly decomposed to the corresponding ester 38 at room temperature (Scheme 7b), where the conversion was ca. 10% per day. Nevertheless, the conversion was completed within minutes upon irradiation (λ > 400 nm).60 Mechanistically, it was proposed that the irradiation of diazo 35 in the presence of singlet oxygen produced carbonyl oxide 40 through carbene 39, and finally photochemically rearranging to dioxirane 37 (Scheme 7b).60

2.2. pH dependence
The stability of dioxirane is anomalous with variations in pH. For the oxidation of pyridine 41 to pyridine-N-oxide (42, PNO), in 1981, Gallopo and Edward studied the stability of various dioxiranes with varying pH (Scheme 8).42 In the absence of any ketone catalyst, the oxidation of 41 with simple caroate 12 gave a negligible amount of PNO 42. The ketone-catalyzed reaction produced the highest yield of 42 at pH 8.5,42 whereas at lower or higher pH the product yield decreased significantly. At higher pH, Oxone® is known to self-decompose, whereas at a lower pH, the ketone is oxidized via BVO, which reduces the concentration of ketone.37,63,64 Thus, optimization of the pH of the reaction carries significant importance.
 Scheme 8  pH dependence the dioxirane-mediated oxidation of pyridine.42 
For example, at pH 7, the reaction with cyclohexanone catalyst showed a significant decrease in oxidation power (ca. 91%) due to the side reaction (BVO) resulting in lactone formation. A significant amount of cyclohexanone was lost, i.e., ca. 69%, and only 72% of 42 was isolated (Table 2, entry 1).42 At a moderate pH of ∼8.5, the reaction gave oxide 42 in 96% yield with negligible loss of cyclohexanone, i.e., <1% (entry 4). However, at higher pH ∼ 9.5, the yield of 42 decreased to 86% and the loss in cyclohexanone was increased to ∼15% (entry 6). This lowering in efficiency was due to both the self-decomposition of Oxone® and BVO.42 The BVO side reaction was suppressed when acyclic ketones like acetone and p-nitroacetophenone were used instead of cyclic ketones.

2.3. Ambiphilic nature
Dioxiranes exhibit peculiar ambiphilic behavior, acting as both a nucleophile and an electrophile. Such behavior was under debate, and several experiments were conducted to unearth its hidden identity. For example, to determine the electronic character, dioxiranes were allowed to react with thianthrene 5-oxide 43 (SSO) (Scheme 9).52,65 Quantification of products 44 (SSO2) and 45 (SOSO) could unmask the nucleophilic or electrophilic nature of the oxidant,52 but the formation of 46 (SOSO2) could inject ambiguity into the experiment, so the reaction was carefully optimized to minimize its formation (Scheme 9).52,65
 Scheme 9  Ambiphilic reactivity of SSO 43.65 
Under basic reaction conditions, KtBuO2, KO2 and H2O2 were found to be nucleophilic for the oxygenation of 43 (Scheme 10), which is expected for an electron-rich oxidant carrying a partial negative charge, e.g., carbonyl oxide.52 Alternatively, oxygenation with H2O2 under an acidic medium switches the reactivity pattern to electrophilic oxygenation (Scheme 10).52,65
 Scheme 10  Nucleophilic character (XSO) of oxygen transfer from an oxidant to thianthrene 5-oxide (43).52,65 
Carbonyloxide, dioxiranes, mCPBA, etc., were also analyzed using this procedure (Scheme 10).52,65 For carbonyl oxide, the oxidation yielded predominantly 43 suggesting nucleophilic character with XSO around 0.92–0.96; XSO is the relative nucleophilic attack of an oxidant on the sulfoxide site of 43, which is determined using mole fractions of 44. Interestingly, dioxiranes also exhibited nucleophilic attributes but possessed poorer nucleophilicity than carbonyl oxide.52,59,65 For the in situ generated dioxiranes using caroate (12), XSO values ranging from 0.57–0.85 were observed, higher than mCPBA (XSO = 0.36).65 Furthermore, in solutions, DMDO (isolated) exhibited higher nucleophilicity in acetone than CH2Cl2, with XSO values of 0.85 and 0.77, respectively. Oxidation with 12 (XSO = 0.37) was electrophilic compared to 9, where 45 and 46 were formed in 51.2 and 30.4% yield, respectively.52,65
In contrast to these results, Murray et al. found dioxiranes to be electrophilic for the oxidations of sulfides and sulfoxides using linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis.66 For the oxidation of sulfides 47 and sulfoxides 49 with 9, the LFER resulted in negative reaction constants (ρ) of −0.77 and −0.76, respectively (Scheme 11a).66 This result was supported by the studies of Vasquez in 1988 where LFER studies for 9-mediated epoxidations of styrene 51 gave ρ = −0.9, supporting an electrophilic nature for 9 (Scheme 11b).67 In addition, Adam et al. reported a negative reaction constant (ρ = −0.8) for the oxidation of thioanisoles with 9,65 indicating substantial generation of positive charge on the S-atom at the transition state for the oxygen transfer.
 Scheme 11  Oxidations revealing the electrophilic nature of 9.66,67 
To address this discrepancy, Adam et al. postulated the anomaly in the selective nature of 9.65 For SSO 43, 9 preferred the electron-poor site leading to 44, revealing its nucleophilic character (Scheme 9). However, for thioanisole (54), there was no such option to choose between electrophilic and nucleophilic sites (Scheme 12). Thus, ambiphilic 9 oxidized both electron-rich and deficient sulfides, where the stabilized transition state will decide the reaction path. For oxygen transfer to prevail, such a transition state requires gaining stabilization through delocalization/resonance. Thus, it was proposed that the oxidation reagent persisted as dioxyl diradical 53, which was reasonable due to the very weak O–O bond in dioxirane, i.e., ∼10–15 kcal mol−1. Such a diradical-type species explains the amphiphilicity of the oxidant.12,13,68
 Scheme 12  Plausible mechanism for the ambiphilic nature of dioxirane for sulfide oxidations.65 
From this respect, for the generation of SSO˙+ a dioxirane radical anion pair was required, which had a very low probability, because the reaction between SSO˙+ and O2˙− showed a lower XNu value whereas photoirradiated 3O2 exhibited a higher value (∼0.78),65 the latter and dioxirane 9 have similar nucleophilicities. This anomaly suggested mesomeric stabilization of a dioxirane-sulfide adduct (55 and 56) in a dipolar fashion (Scheme 12). Thus, the sulfur atom in thioanisole with an electron-donating substituent stabilizes a positive charge in 55. In this case, it will exhibit a ρ < 0 value as observed for the aforementioned dioxirane-mediated sulfide oxidation without requiring an electrophilic oxidant. Alternatively, with an electron-deficient substituent (56), the reaction of dioxirane will display a ρ > 0 value. Thus, for a series of electronically distinguishable sulfides, the LFER study for 9-mediated oxidation will display a parabolic Hammett plot.52,65
In a twist to these findings, in 1993, Baumstark and Harden reported the electrophilic nature of 9 for the epoxidation of substituted chalcones 57 irrespective of substitution at the 4- or 4′-positions (Scheme 13).69 The LFER analysis revealed that both 4- and 4′-substituted chalcones, i.e., 57a and 57b, respectively, had negative reaction constants (ρ+) of −1.03 and −0.182, respectively. Finally, it could be concluded that the electrophilic property of dioxirane prevailed over nucleophilic attributes. In an electrophilic fashion, dioxirane inserting into the C–H bond, producing the C-oxygenated product, was reported by Curci in 1996,70 where the reaction was supposedly proceeding via diradical species 53, involving concerted oxenoid species, which was further supported by theoretical calculations.14
 Scheme 13  Epoxidation of 4,4′-chalcones with electrophilic 9.69 
Curci et al. compared kinetic data for the reaction of 9 with various substrates and obtained the following order: α,β-unsaturated carbonyls < alkynes < alkenes < heteroaromatic nitrogen base < sulfoxides ≪ sulfide.14 The pattern displays the nucleophilic nature of the substrates towards the O–O bond of 9. For example, electron-deficient substrates like p-tolyl methyl sulfoxide and 2-cyclohexen-1-one reacted much more slowly than the corresponding sulfides and cyclohexene (∼300 and ∼130 times slower, respectively). This strongly indicates the transfer of an electrophilic oxygen from 9.14 In 2002, Asensio and co-workers studied dioxirane (9 and 10) mediated sulfide oxidation using 2H and 18O experiments and found that the oxidants were highly electrophilic.71
In 2008, Curci et al. studied the oxidation of m- or p-substituted cinnamonitriles, bearing OMe, Me, H, Cl and NO2 groups, using both 9 and 10.72 They found that the dioxirane-mediated epoxidation of olefins proceeded in an electrophilic fashion, even with the olefins bearing electron-withdrawing groups. The LFER study found ρ-values of −0.98 and −1.9 for dioxiranes 9 and 10, respectively. These large negative ρ-values clearly indicated that the reactions were proceeding through a positively charged species, which unambiguously supported the electrophilic nature of the dioxiranes in epoxidations.72
2.4. Thermochemistry
In 1985, Murray and Jeyaraman reported that refluxing in situ generated dioxirane 9 in acetone resulted in the formation of triperoxide 60 and diperoxide 59 in 66% combined yield (Scheme 14).3 Although Curci et al. found similar diperoxide 59,40,73 such a dimer was not observed later.13
 Scheme 14  Thermal cyclization of in situ generated DMDO 9 to triperoxide and diperoxide.3 
In 1989, while studying aldehyde oxidation, Baumstark et al. observed the thermal decomposition of 9.74 The oxidation of aldehyde with 9 (1:1 ratio) did not go to completion. While unreacted aldehyde was isolated, unreacted 9 was not found. The latter decomposed rapidly, producing α-hydroxyacetone (61, acetol) at room temperature (Scheme 15). The formation of 61 was possibly from the oxidation of acetone, which initially underwent keto–enol tautomerism to give enol 62. Epoxidation of 62 with 9 gave 63, which was then hydrolyzed to acetol 61. The decomposition of hexadeuterated-dioxirane 9 (i.e., DMDO-d6) in acetone-d6 was comparatively slower than in acetone solution, supporting the enol mechanism.74 In contrast, under basic conditions, a zero-order decomposition of 9 was observed with a higher kinetic isotope effect of kH/kD = 4.
 Scheme 15  Decomposition of 9 into acetol in acetone solution at room temperature.74 
Similar to 9, dioxirane 10 decomposed into methyl trifluoroacetate (64) and trifluoracetic acid (65); the latter was the hydrolyzed product of 64 (Scheme 16).4,75
 Scheme 16  Exothermic decomposition of 10 into trifluoroacetic acid.4,75 
The dioxiranes are very reactive and are generally isolated in solution. The predicted boiling and flash points for 9, 10, 4a and 4b are −21.6 ± 23.0 and −31.1 ± 29.4, −22.5 ± 43.0 and −55.8 ± 24.0, −22.4 ± 45.0 and −55.7 ± 24.6, and −129.6 ± 35.0 and −121.8 ± 21.8 °C, respectively, at 760 torr.76
3. Design, synthesis, and isolation of dioxirane derivatives
Although dioxiranes were synthesized by Talbotte and Thompson in 1972,30 it was Murray and Jeyaraman who successfully synthesized a series of dioxiranes (4a, 4c–d, 9, and 66–76, vide infra) using the Oxone®–ketone system.3,77 The reaction conditions required pH ∼ 7.4–8.0, which was maintained by KOH/phosphate buffer. This protocol gave access to dioxirane solutions directly from the reaction vessel through simple distillation. The strength of the dioxirane solution was estimated by titrating it with PPh3 or PhSMe. The solutions are stable enough to be stored at refrigerator temperature for several days with no or little decomposition. Dioxirane 9 was produced in the highest yield of approximately 0.04–0.185 M solution. Although dioxiranes 66–69 were isolated in good yield, with bulky substituents on the ketones the yield of the respective dioxiranes decreased.3 In 1992, Murray et al. successfully developed a variety of cyclohexanone-based dioxirane derivatives 72–76.77 Dioxirane 10 developed by Curci et al. does perform oxygen transfer like 9 but at a higher rate.4

  In 1987, Adam and coworkers introduced both large- and small-scale protocols to access 9 by employing KHSO5–NaHCO3 in acetone–H2O medium.40,78 Such an easy and convenient protocol enabled chemists to explore it for various purposes. In 1996, the same group generated 9 and 10in situ in both aqueous and non-aqueous media by reacting a ketone with arenesulfonylimidazole and NaOH in the presence of the oxidant H2O2.79
In 1997, the Messeguer group extracted 9 and 10 with oxidation-resistant solvents such as CHCl3, CH2Cl2, CCl4, CFCl3, toluene, ethyl acetate, etc., in a ketone-free manner.80 This affords higher concentration solutions of dioxirane such as 0.30 M in CHCl3, whereas a maximum up to 0.1 M of 9 in acetone can be isolated,78 Furthermore, acetone was prone to BVO.
There are a myriad of applications of dioxiranes, which also include modified dioxiranes with enhanced stability, reactivity and selectivity. The details are discussed below.
4. Applications of dioxiranes in organic synthesis
4.1. Oxidations

4.1.1. Oxidation of sulfides, disulfides, thioketones and sulfilimines. 
The oxidation products of sulfides, namely sulfoxides and sulfones, are synthetically important due to their widespread uses in accessing diverse organic scaffolds with applications in organic electronics and biological and pharmaceutical arenas.81 In addition, chiral sulfoxides are important in a number of asymmetric applications.82,83 Although the oxidation of sulfides can be executed by employing a variety of methods,84,85 dioxiranes act as an alternative to methodologies that use or produce hazardous materials.
The oxidations of sulfides with 9 were already discussed in the ambiphilic studies (cf.Schemes 10 and 11a).39,52 Although the mechanism is under debate, it is obvious that dioxiranes can oxidize a variety of sulfides and sulfoxides. In 1985, Murray and Jeyaraman developed 9-mediated chemoselective oxidation of sulfide 54 to corresponding sulfone 77 with 98% GC yield (Scheme 17).3 Furthermore, a variety of substituted aryl methyl sulfides with both electron-rich and -deficient thioanisoles were oxidized with 9.66 This study was used to attest to the electrophilic nature of 9 (Scheme 11a).
 Scheme 17  Oxidation of methyl phenyl sulfide with 9.3 
In 1989, Colonna and co-workers developed an enantioselective oxidation of prochiral sulfides 78 in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA, 80) by generating dioxirane in situ (Scheme 18).86 The catalysis with dioxirane precursors bearing a CF3 group (81–83) showed faster reactivities than cyclohexanone 84 and 11. Oxidation of sulfides 78 with bulky alkyl groups like iPr and tBu, gave sulfoxides 79 with higher enantioselectivity, i.e., 73 and 79% ee, respectively, whereas enantioselectivity with other alkyl p-tolyl sulfides was poor, i.e., only 9–64% ee (Scheme 18).86,87
 Scheme 18  Oxidation of sulfides with in situ generated dioxiranes in the presence of chiral BSA 80.86,87 
In 1994, Webb and co-workers developed the chemoselective oxidation of sulfides 78 to sulfoxide 79 or sulfone 85 by in situ-generated dioxirane 9 at low temperature (Scheme 19).88 Sulfoxides 79 were isolated predominantly when the reaction was done with only 0.65 equiv. of Oxone® at low temperature and quenched with sodium bisulfite. Conversely, sulfones 85 are the exclusive products with a higher amount of Oxone® (1.35 equiv.) at ambient temperature (Scheme 19).88
 Scheme 19  Chemoselective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxide and sulfone.88 
The reaction was mild and selective and worked efficiently without affecting the active methylene group in 78a (Table 3, entry 1) or the aliphatic alcohol in 78c (entry 3). While the reaction with 78d (entry 4), containing a benzyl alcohol substituent, gave a poor yield (∼46.6%) of sulfoxide 79d, sulfone 85d was formed in good yield (83.4%). The poor yield of the former was likely due to the poor solubility of the sulfide in the aqueous medium whereas a hydrophilic sulfoxide was an intermediate for the latter. For acrylic acid 78e, the sulfoxide was isolated in excellent yield whereas only 35% sulfone was produced (entry 5). In this case, the poor yield of sulfone was due to concomitant epoxidation of the olefin moiety.88 In 2006, Dieva and co-workers demonstrated the asymmetric oxidation of prochiral sulfides using chiral dioxirane; the corresponding chiral sulfoxides were isolated in ∼6–25% ee.89

In 1990, the Tabuchi group treated thioketone 86 with in situ generated 9 and obtained S-oxygenated product 87 in 29% yield along with adamantanone (Scheme 20a).90,91 Conversely, when 9 (1 equiv.) was allowed to react with (E)-aryl thioaldehyde 88 the (E)-S-oxide 89 was formed quantitatively at −78 °C (Scheme 20b).92 However, at 20 °C, 89(E) and 90(Z) were formed in 20:1 ratio with similar yields. For 2-mercaptobenzoheterazoles, depending on the reaction conditions, treatment with 9 gave different products such as benzoxazole, benzoimidazole, and benzothiazoles.93
 Scheme 20  Oxidation of thioketones with 9.90–92 
In 1997, N-protected sulfilimines 91 were oxidized to 92 (90–95% yield) when treated with 9 (Scheme 21a).94 The methodology was very mild. For example, the reaction of chiral sulfilimine 93 (80% ee, R) with 9 gave oxidation product 94 with similar enantioselectivity and retention of configuration, i.e., 80% ee (R) (Scheme 21b).94
 Scheme 21  Oxidation of N-protected sulfilimines with 9.94 
Khiar et al. reported the enantioselective oxidation of sterically hindered disulfides 95 in 2007 (Scheme 22).95 The methodology used the Shi organocatalytic system, i.e., carbohydrate-derived ketone 96/Oxone®, cf. Shi epoxidation (Section 4.2.6.1).16 Oxidation produced thiosulfinates 97 in excellent yields (up to 97%) with up to 96% ee.95
 Scheme 22  Dioxirane-mediated enantioselective oxidation of sterically hindered disulfides.95 


4.1.2. Oxidation of alcohols. 
The synthesis of carbonyl compounds by the oxidation of alcohols is a common organic transformation,96 accomplished by various oxidation methods such as transition metal-mediated,97,98 electrochemical,99,100 hypervalent iodine,101–105 Oxone,64,106 O2,107etc. The oxidation products (i.e., aldehydes, ketones, and carboxylic acids) are important in organic synthesis for diverse applications.107 During C–H hydroxylation of unactivated secondary alkanes with dioxirane 10 in 1989, Curci et al. serendipitously isolated ketones instead of the alcohol.75 Oxidation of norbornane yielded both alcohol and ketone products. The alcohol was thus proposed as an intermediate, which was then oxidized to the corresponding ketone.75,108 Thus, using 10 (1.1–1.3 equiv.) a variety of primary, secondary and benzyl alcohols 98 were oxidized where the ketones 99 were obtained in 90–99% yield (Scheme 23a).109 Compared to aliphatic alcohols, primary benzyl alcohol reacted at a slower pace with the concomitant formation of aldehyde and benzoic acid.
 Scheme 23  Oxidation of alcohol using methyl(trifluoromethyl)dioxirane 10.109 
The reaction was accelerated by using a higher amount of 10 (2.2 equiv.). However, carboxylic acid was produced in 94% yield.109 Similarly, with a higher equivalent of 10, 1-butanol (100) produced 1-butanoic acid (101) along with hemiacetal 102 (observed in 1H NMR) (Scheme 23b). Surprisingly, 2-methyl propanol was unreactive under the reaction conditions.109
Overall, the reaction conditions are well-tolerated by various alcohol reactants. For example, when alcohols with chiral epoxide groups are subjected to the reaction conditions the corresponding ketones are produced in excellent yields without disturbing the chirality.109 This protocol oxidizes secondary alcohols in a more facile manner than primary analogs, due to the ease of formation of the hemiacetal and its subsequent oxidation (Scheme 24).109 Mechanistically, oxidation can proceed via two routes: (i) direct hydroxylation producing gem-diol 103; or (ii) through the formation of hemiacetal 104. For the latter case, additional experiments were performed to analyze the reactivities of alcohols and hemiacetals. In this respect, solutions of hemiacetal were made by mixing reactant alcohol and 81 (1:8, v/v) in CHCl3. For a primary alcohol (EtOH), the formation of the hemiacetal was rapid and 30:70 ratio of alcohol/hemiacetal was observed after 5 min. Instead, a slower rate for the secondary alcohol (2-propanol) was observed where the alcohol/hemiacetal ratio was found to be 35:65 after 60 min. The 1H NMR studies implied that the oxidation of the secondary alcohol was completed within 4 min (<3% hemiacetal found unreacted). However, for the primary alcohol the reaction was slower—only 50% of hemiacetal was consumed even after 30 min. Although no signal for oxygenated-hemiacetal 105 was observed for both cases, it was naively proposed that oxidation proceeded through competitive hemiacetal 104 formation, which caused slower oxidation for the primary alcohol compared to the secondary one.109
 Scheme 24  Plausible mechanism for alcohol oxidation by dioxirane 10.109 
When cyclobutanol was treated with 10 cyclobutanone was formed,109 Thus, oxidation likely proceeded via a two-electron transfer process,110 because the reaction with one electron oxidants (e.g., CrO3 and RuO4) usually cleaves the C–C bond of the alcohol resulting in γ-hydroxy butyraldehyde.110–112 In addition, the reaction is unaffected by atmospheric oxygen, which eliminates any possible radical pathway. The oxidation kinetics of cyclohexanol revealed a kinetic isotope effect of kH/kD = 1.6. Finally, alcohol oxidation is proposed through an “oxenoid” species 106 (vide infra), which is responsible for O-insertion into the α-C–H bonds.109

  In 1991, Adam et al. explored the asymmetric potential of in situ generated dioxiranes for vicinal-diol oxidation. In this case, chiral ketone 96 was used as a dioxirane precursor in the presence of co-oxidant Curox® (12) and K2CO3 (Scheme 25).113 The oxidation of 1,2-diols 107 produced α-hydroxy ketone 108 with observable enantiomeric excess. While p-substituted 1,2-diphenylethane diols produced 24–60% ee from meso-107, the dl isomers produced 61–75% ee. For derivatives with ortho-steric effects like meso-107 (for R = o-Cl), the enantioselectivity was very poor, i.e., only 17% ee. The oxidation with asymmetric vicinal-diols gave poorer enantioselectivity compared to symmetric analogs, cf. 5–61% ee.113
 Scheme 25  Enantioselective oxidation of vic-diols.113 
A regio-selective oxidation protocol for diols to carbonyl compounds using dioxirane 9 was developed by Bovicelli et al. in 1994, where secondary alcohols were oxidized to carbonyl compounds in the presence of a primary alcohol.114
The dioxirane-mediated oxidation of a secondary alcohol was re-analyzed by Baumstark and co-workers in 2010 using KIE studies.115 For carbinol-H, a primary KIE (kH/kD = 5.2) was observed for isopropanol, whereas isopropyl-1,1,1,3,3,3-d6-alcohol showed a secondary KIE (kOH/kOD = 0.98). Similarly, isopropanol-d exhibited a secondary KIE (kOH/kOD = 1.2). With this observation, oxidation was proposed to proceed through a more complex process than that previously reported.109,115


4.1.3. Oxidation of aldehydes. 
The oxidation of an aldehyde to a carboxylate is known to be very facile116,117 and can be achieved by using various oxidants in stoichiometric as well as catalytic fashion.117–119 In 1985, Murray and Jeyaraman reported the first example of aldehyde oxidation employing in situ generated 9 in which acetaldehyde was successfully oxidized to acetic acid.3 Interestingly, the reaction contained traces of side products like peracetic acid, acetone triperoxide (60), and the trimer of acetaldehyde. The next idea to explore dioxiranes for aldehyde oxidation came from a side reaction observed earlier by Mello et al. in 1991, where the treatment of dioxirane 10 with benzyl alcohols gave the corresponding carboxylic acids (Scheme 23b), and the reaction proceeded via an aldehyde intermediate.109
A protocol for aldehyde oxidation using 9 (acetone solution) was reported earlier by Baumstark et al. in 1989, which was performed in the dark under ambient temperature and atmosphere.74 Using this protocol various benzaldehydes with p-substituents such as H, MeO, Me, Br, CN, NO2, etc., were oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acids. The reaction gave carboxylic acids in excellent isolated yields for electron-rich aldehydes with p-MeO, H, and Me substitutions. Conversely, the oxidation of deactivated systems gave comparatively lower yields, i.e., 60–70%. Surprisingly, under an inert atmosphere (Ar or N2) oxidation gave comparatively lower yields, i.e., 44–60%, for H, MeO, Br and NO2 substituted aldehydes. The reaction can be tuned and quantitative yields of acids even under an argon atmosphere can be achieved by employing higher equivalents of 9, i.e., 3–4-times with respect to the aldehyde. When the reactions are performed under aerated and non-aerated (N2 or Ar) conditions, the yields for the former showed are higher. For example, in the reaction under an air atmosphere, oxidation of p-anisaldehyde (109) with only 1 equiv. of 9 gives 90% yield of p-anisic acid (110) (Scheme 26). However, for non-aerated (N2 or Ar) conditions, the reaction gave poorer yields, and required a higher amount of 9 (3–4 equiv.).
 Scheme 26  Study of the oxygen effect on the oxidation of aldehyde with 9.74 
Although the reaction is faster for aerated conditions, along with expected acid 110 the concomitant formation of p-anisyl formate 111 is observed, which is not found for the reactions performed under N2 or Ar atmospheres. It was proposed that product 110 was due to interference from O2, and to analyze this effect the reaction was performed under an oxygen atmosphere (17O2). This reaction is faster than the open-air experiments and can oxidize ∼2–3 equiv. of aldehyde 109 with just 1 equiv. of 9. However, while the yield of 110 decreased under the 17O2 atmosphere, the ester formed 111 in a higher amount (Scheme 26).74 When the products isolated from the reaction under the 17O2 atmosphere were analyzed, the NMR spectroscopically labelled 17O was found in both the acid 110/110′ and ester 111 supporting the involvement of 17O2 in the oxidation (Scheme 26).74 Thus, the overall oxidation was proposed to involve radicals that went through diradical dioxirane 53 (Scheme 27).
 Scheme 27  Plausible mechanism for 9-mediated aldehyde oxidation.74 
Initially, 53 either abstracts hydrogen from aldehyde 112 to produce two radical species (114 and 115) or it adds to 112 giving diradical adduct 113. In the next step, the radical species 114 and 115 merge or 113 undergoes intramolecular hydrogen abstraction to produce hemiacetal 115. Finally, 116 is hydrolyzed to produce corresponding carboxylic acid 117.74
In 1998, Webb and Ruszkay generated 9in situ to synthesize carboxylic acids by oxidizing a broad spectrum of aldehydes. Products were obtained in good to excellent yields.120 However, it was found that Oxone® was efficient enough to furnish oxidation without acetone, i.e., no need for 9.120


4.1.4. Oxidation of amines. 
The oxidation of amines with dioxiranes is quite interesting and depending on the substrate and reaction conditions the output varies drastically. For example, amines upon oxidation can give products like NO2, N-hydroxyl amine, –NO, etc.121,122
In 1986, Murray and co-workers treated 9 (0.05 M in acetone) with various amines under dark conditions.123 Using this oxidation protocol, aromatic amines like aniline and p-anisidine were converted into the corresponding nitrobenzene in excellent GC yields, i.e., 97 and 94%, respectively. Conversely, primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic amines were oxidized to nitro-products with 84–95% GC yield. In addition, trans-azobenzene gave azoxybenzene in 96% yield.123 For this case, GC analysis indicated the formation of 1-nitrobutane solely, and there was no sign of any other product. The reaction was proposed to proceed through a blue intermediate, i.e., nitrosoarene 121 (Scheme 28).123 Mechanistically, the initial oxidation of aniline (118) with 9 leads to N-hydroxyl compounds 119 and 120. Then, 120 undergoes dehydration to give nitrosobenzene (121), which was finally oxidized by 9 to give 122.123
 Scheme 28  Plausible mechanism for the oxidation of aniline to nitrobenzene mediated by 9.123 
In 1988, Zabrowski et al. developed an in situ generated dioxirane protocol for amine oxidation that included the phase transfer catalyst (PTC) n-Bu4NHSO4 (Scheme 29).124 It is useful for the oxidation of electron-rich amines 123 to nitroarenes 124 in a facile manner. In addition, the oxidation of aromatic amines to the corresponding nitro-arenes is so facile that it can be executed even in the presence of highly nucleophilic aromatics like indoles and furans.124 Furthermore, oxidation works for both electron-rich and deficient arenes. However, the reaction gives poor yields for anilines substituted with carboxylic acid and hydroxy groups. The reactions work for electron-rich anilines like 2,4-dimethoxy, 3,4,5-trimethoxy, and 3,4-methylenedioxy derivatives producing the desired nitro compounds in 85, 52 and 57% isolated yield, respectively. For the latter case, the mildness of the reaction conditions can be attested, as the sensitive functional group (3,4-methylenedioxy) is well tolerated. Although the reactions with 2,5- and 3,5-dimethoxy anilines produced the expected nitro compounds, the yields were lower, and partially oxidized nitroso-products were isolated.124 The so-formed nitroso-compound was earlier a proposed intermediate.123
 Scheme 29  Oxidation of electron-rich aromatic amines with in situ generated DMDO.124 
Like the 2,5- and 3,5-dimethoxy anilines, the oxidation of 5-aminoindole (125) resulted in the formation of both nitro- and nitrosoindole products 126 and 127, in a 7:3 ratio, respectively (Scheme 30a). In this case, the incomplete oxidation of 125 was assumed to be due to the consumption of oxidant in other competing side reactions. For example, in the case of indole 125, both the 2,3-olefinic bond and amine were oxidized.124 When a mixture of N-sulfonyl protected indole 128 and aniline 118 was subjected to this oxidation protocol, the latter was oxidized to 122 in 98% yield, whereas 128 was isolated back quantitatively (Scheme 30b). It indicates the involvement of the nucleophilic double bond with the dioxirane during the oxidation of 5-aminoindole (125).
 Scheme 30  Oxidation of indoles and aniline with in situ generated dioxirane 9.124 
Alternatively, when a mixture of 118 and indole was oxidized, both 121 and 122 were formed in a combined yield of 35%.124 Indole was not recovered from the reaction, which strongly suggested that the oxidant was partially consumed by indole. Similarly, when furfuryl amine was subjected to the reaction conditions, neither the oxidation product nor the reactant was recovered. For a mixture of 118 and furan (129), nitrobenzene 122 was produced in 78% yield (Scheme 30c). In addition, oxidation can be done with protonated amines under strongly acidic conditions, e.g., o- and p-phenylenediamines were protonated by hydrochloric acid and then treated with 9 to get the desired dinitro compounds in 85 and 82% yield, respectively.125 Overall, the observations led to the conclusion that 9 was highly selective towards aniline even though other electron-rich systems were present. However, these methodologies were only limited to electron-rich cases and were not suitable for the oxidation of electron-deficient anilines.
In 1995, Webb and Seneviratne developed the dioxirane-mediated oxidation of electron-deficient aromatic amines.127 While the reaction was buffered with an excess of NaHCO3, no PTC was used here. In addition, unlike the previous method that uses lower temperatures, the new protocol operates at ambient temperature. However, it was found that Oxone® could execute such amine oxidation under the employed reaction conditions without acetone.127
In 2009, Volkova et al. developed a dioxirane 9 enabled synthesis of nitro-substituted cyclopropanes 131 from amines 130 in up to 76% yield (Scheme 31a). The reaction has high selectivity. For example, cyclopropylamine 132 with a spiro-butyl ring gave desired product 134 in 60% isolated yield, whereas ozone gave only 3% yield (Scheme 31b). However, mCPBA gave oxazole 133, i.e., 4,5-dihydroisoxazole.126
 Scheme 31  Oxidation of cyclopropyl amine using DMDO 9.126 
Murray et al. developed a protocol for chemoselective oxidation of secondary amines to prepare N-hydroxyl amines and nitrones using dioxirane 9 and 72.77,129N,N-dibenzyl amine 135 was chemoselectively oxidized to corresponding hydroxyl amine 136 and N-oxide 137, respectively (Scheme 32). With 1 equiv. of 9, the reaction afforded hydroxylamine 136, whereas with higher amounts of 72 (2 equiv.) nitrone 137 was produced.
 Scheme 32  Oxidation of N,N-dibenzylamine with dioxirane 9129 and 72.77 
Earlier, in 1988, Murray and Singh successfully converted tertiary amines into the corresponding nitroxides in 93–100% isolated yields using a stoichiometric amount of 9.128 Interestingly, for α-tetraalkyl-substituted sterically hindered amines, by changing the amount of 9, either N-hydroxyl amine129 or N-oxide could be prepared chemoselectively. For example, while 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-ol reacts with 1.2 equiv. of 9 to give N-hydroxyl amine in 99% yield, N-oxides were obtained quantitatively with a higher amount of 9 (2 equiv.). The alcohol functionality remained unaffected by the employed reaction conditions.128,129 Conversely, for α-unsubstituted secondary amines like pyrrolidine, reaction with 9 gave hydroxamic acids.130
Towards this development, in 1995, Brik developed a catalytic protocol to oxidize secondary amines 138 (without α-H) to respective nitroxides 139 under a biphasic conditions at 0 °C in the presence of a PTC (Scheme 33).131 This protocol gave access to a variety of nitroxides 139a–g in 75–93% yield (Scheme 33). Chemoselective oxidation of amine to nitroxide was observed for an olefinic substrate that produced 139a.131
 Scheme 33  Oxidation of secondary amines to nitroxides by in situ generated DMDO catalyst.131 
In 1997, Ferrer et al. reported the 9-mediated chemoselective N-oxidation of an olefin with tertiary-amine 140,132 where the N-oxygenated products 141 were formed quantitatively through electrocyclization of intermediate 142 (observed by NMR) (Scheme 34).

The synthesis of pyridine N-oxide is well known,133,134 and such compounds have a myriad of applications as synthetic intermediates,135–137 oxidants,136,138 and in self-assembly,139etc. In 1981, Gallopo and Edwards developed the 9-mediated synthesis of N-oxides 42 using a ketone–caroate system (Scheme 8).42 Kinetic studies by Adam et al. substantiated Murray's hypothesis12 that N-oxidation took place via an SN2 mechanism with the nitrogen lone pair of 41 directly attacking the O–O bond of 9 to produce zwitterionic adduct 143 (Scheme 35). Then 143 decomposed to oxide 42, releasing 11. In addition, the reaction produces singlet oxygen, probably due to the decomposition of adduct 144 formed by the nucleophilic addition of 42 to 9 (Scheme 35).140

In 1997, the Messeguer group developed procedures for 9-mediated chemoselective N-oxidations of tertiary amines and pyridines in the presence of olefins.132 Winkeljohn et al. separately studied pyridines and olefin oxidation with 9. The former was found to react at a faster rate.141N-Oxidation with 9 was chemoselective with pyridine-bearing olefins. For example, pyridine 145 gave corresponding N-oxide 146 quantitatively (Scheme 36).132
 Scheme 36  Chemoselective N-oxidation in the presence of olefins.132 


4.1.6. Oxidation of lactams. 
Dioxiranes exhibit novel C–H vs. N–H chemoselectivity due to the duality of the mechanism where the O–O bond can cleave either homo- or heterolytically.6 Thus, such 1e− and 2e− oxidation properties result in dioxiranes furnishing a variety of transformations. Annese and co-workers explored such properties of dioxiranes 9 and 10, and explored them for the oxidation of peptides and lactams.142–145 In 2017, when Annese and co-workers oxidized lactam 147 with dioxiranes (9 and 10) mainly two kinds of products were formed. While reaction with 10 underwent N–H oxidation producing nitroacids 151, imides 155 and dicarboxylic acid monoamides 156 were formed with 9via C(sp3)–H oxidations, respectively (Scheme 37).6 The electron-withdrawing character of fluorine in 10 facilitates a polar transition state, where the heteroatom (nitrogen) cleaves the O–O bond heterolytically.6,146 Conversely, 9 has a lower energy diradical transition state. Thus, homolytic cleavage of O–O facilitates C–H activation. Theoretical calculations further supported the mechanistic correlation with the electronic stability of intermediates. The reaction represents a rare case of chemoselectivity directed by dioxirane reactivity instead of the substrate.6

4.1.7. Oxidation of isocyanates. 
The classical approach to prepare a nitro-compound from its carboxylic acid analog through an isocyanate intermediate is lengthy and overall low yielding.41 The procedure developed for the facile conversion of isocyanate from a carboxylic acid using trimethylsilyl azide (TMSN3) simplified the desired aforementioned synthesis.147 Thus, in 1988, Eaton and Wicks converted isocyanates 158 into the corresponding nitro-compounds (159 and 160) using dioxirane 9 (Scheme 38).41 For example, phenyl isocyanate (158a) was successfully converted into nitrobenzene (159) in 95% yield. Notably, the reaction does not work in the absence of water. In addition, reactants with hydrophobic substituents gave poor yields. For example, primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic nitro compounds 160a–c were produced only in <5–34% yield. For such substrates, the use of a PTC like BnNMe3OH (157) facilitated the reactions, and the yields for 160a–c increased to 83–94%.41 These methodologies were applicable to synthesize high-energy 1,4-dinitrocubane 162 from its isocyanate precursor 161 in 85% yield.
 Scheme 38  DMDO 9 mediated oxidation of isocyanate to nitro compounds.41 
It was proposed that the electron-deficient isocyanate was first hydrolyzed to carbamate, then to amine, and finally, the amine reacted with 9 to give the nitro-product.41,123 It was supported by the formation of 4-methylnitrocubane 164 from 4-methylaminocubane 163b whereas there was no reaction for electron-deficient 4-methyl(tert-methoxycarbonyl)aminocubane 163a even with an excess of 9 (Scheme 39).41 The hydrolysis of isocyanate to the amine was very important and prevented the oxidation of 163a.
 Scheme 39  DMDO 9 mediated oxidation of 4-methylaminocubane.41 


4.1.8. Oxidation of selenides. 
Selenium-based compounds are biologically important due to their resemblance to other chalcogens.148 Thus, the synthesis of such compounds is essential and is accessed by several methods.149 In particular, among all the selenium compounds, the hexavalent seleninates and selenonates are prepared from the oxidation of selenides.150 In this regard, Abdo and Knapp reported the oxidation of selenium using 9 in 2008 (Scheme 40).151 The synthesis of these biomimetic selenium compounds begins with the oxidation of selenoester 165 with 2.1 equiv. 9 to get selenic acid 166 in 94% isolated yield. In turn, 166 was oxidized to selenonate 167 in 96% yield where an excess of the oxidant 9 was used. Finally, 167 was treated with sodium methoxide to obtain sodium selenoate 168. Alternatively, the authors reported the direct synthesis of selenoate 167 from 165 in one-pot with 81% isolated yield by using 9 (excess).151
 Scheme 40  DMDO 9 mediated oxidation of selenoesters.151 


4.1.9. Oxidation of boronic acids and boronate esters. 
The transformation of boronic acids and boronate esters into alcohols or hydroxyarenes is a well-explored protocol that carries significant importance as the end product phenols are abundant in many natural products, drugs and dyes.152–154 In this regard, to synthesize phenols from organoboranes, Webb and Levy used 9 (in situ) for the conversion of boronic acids 169 into phenols 170 (∼81–98% yield) (Scheme 41a).155 The mild reaction conditions allowed the oxidation of 171 to 172 without affecting the methylenedioxy-group (Scheme 41b). The procedure was applicable to the oxidation of boronate esters 173 and 175 to phenol (174) and exo-norborneol (176), respectively (Scheme 41c and d). In the absence of acetone, oxidation gave poor yields.155 Such a transformation in a ketone-free manner using Oxone® as an oxidant for tetrafluoroborates was developed by Molander and Cavalcanti in 2011.152
 Scheme 41  Oxidation of boronic acids and esters with DMDO.155 


4.1.10. Oxidation of organo-iodanes. 
Hypervalent iodine compounds are renowned for mild, selective, inexpensive, easily accessible, environmentally-benign and user-friendly attributes.102,105,156–158 In general, such compounds with higher oxidation states like +3 and +5, are prepared by oxidation with KBrO3,159,160 NaIO4,160 Oxone®,103,104,161 selectfluor,162 NaOCl,163etc. In this regard, dioxiranes are capable of converting iodo compounds into the corresponding I(III) and I(V) species in a facile manner. For example, the treatment of aryl iodides such as iodobenzene (177) with 9 results in a mixture of hypervalent iodine compounds iodosobenzene (178) and iodylbenzene (179) in a 2:1 ratio (Scheme 42).164 The reaction conditions were mild and operated under ambient conditions, whereas oxidation with KBrO3, NaIO4 and Oxone® required heating.159–161
 Scheme 42  DMDO-mediated oxidation of iodobenzene.164 
Due to the mild reaction conditions, iodoarenes with heteroatoms can be chemoselectively oxidized to the corresponding iodylarenes using an excess of DMDO.165–168 For example, in 2005, Zhdankin et al. prepared λ5-iodane 181 from the iodo-amide 180 in 40–79% isolated yield (Scheme 43a).165 In 2016, Yoshida et al. prepared chiral hypervalent iodine(V) 183 from iodoarene 182 using 9 (Scheme 43b).169 The reaction undergoes 100% conversion at room temperature within 5 min. However, oxidation using NaOCl, Oxone® and mCPBA was unsuccessful despite employing a large excess of the oxidant at elevated temperatures with longer reaction times.169 However, cyclohexyl iodide (184) tends to eliminate the oxidized IO group as hypoiodous acid (IOH, 187) resulting in cyclohexene (186), which subsequently reacts with 187 to afford trans-iodohydrins 188 as the major product in 43% yield (Scheme 44).164

 Scheme 44  DMDO-mediated oxidation of iodocyclohexane.164 


4.1.11. Oxidation of Si–H bonds. 
The conversion of silanes into silanols is a broadly enabling reaction170,171 that offers access to these useful building blocks in organosilicon chemistry. Despite the Si–H bond (318 kJ mol−1) being considerably weaker than the C–H bond (411 kJ mol−1),172 there are only a few oxidants that offer the selective conversion of silanes into silanols.173,174 In this regard, in 1990, Adam et al. used dioxiranes 9 and 10 to oxidize various silanes 189 to corresponding silanols 190 in ≥98% yield (Scheme 45a).173 Oxidation with 10 was very fast. Reactions for 189a–c were over in less than 1 min, whereas the oxidation of 189c with 9 took 18 min.
 Scheme 45  Dioxirane-mediated oxidation of silanes.173 
When the oxygenation of 189a (Si–H bond) and adamantane 191 (C–H bond)75 with dioxirane (9 or 10) were compared,1739 was consumed at a faster rate than 10. The oxidation of 189a was faster than 191, where Si–H oxidation with 9 and 10 were 200 and 54 times more reactive than C–H, respectively (BDE for Si–H, ∼77 kcal mol−1; for C–H, ∼99 kcal mol−1).173
The kinetic isotope effect for Si–H bond oxygenation with 9 for Et3SiH vs. Et3SiD was kH/kD = 2.6 at 0 °C,173 eliminating the involvement of any silyl radical (Et3Si˙). This KIE is quite similar to the oxygenation of nBu3SiH using carbene (kH/kD = 1.23), whereas electrophilic ozone has a very different value (kH/kD = 6.9).175–177 Furthermore, product 190c displayed complete retention in configuration (Scheme 45a). Similar to carbene insertion, oxygenation of the Si–H bond with dioxiranes proceeds through an “oxene” mechanism via “butterfly-like” three-membered transition state 193 (vide infra).173 Conversely, five-membered transition state 194 is also possible and adheres to all the aforementioned experimental findings.173  


4.1.12. Oxidation of hydroxyarenes. 
Electron-rich phenols and thiophenols are prone to oxidation, and depending on the reaction conditions the end-product varies.178–182 For example, in 1991, when Crandall et al. oxidized o- and p-tBu-protected phenols with 9, o-quinones were predominantly obtained. In contrast, 1-naphthol produced both o- and p-quinones.183 In 2000, Yang et al. found an intramolecular regioselective lactonization of phenols via C–H oxygenation where the ketone was appended on an alkyl side chain (cf. Section 4.6).184 In 2008, Uliana and co-workers185 used in situ generated dioxiranes for the oxidation of phenols 195 to the corresponding p-quinones 196 (Scheme 46). Benzoquinones are of paramount importance due to their abundance in various natural products.178,186 However, the yields were poor.
 Scheme 46  Oxidation of monophenols to p-quinones using in situ generated DMDO.185 
Oxidation with 9 gave corresponding p-quinones (199e–h) only up to 23% yield (Table 4). Yields under an ambient oxygen atmosphere were further limited to 19%.185 Conversely, the oxidation of 195 with Oxone® (without ketone) gave 196 in better yields (up to 41%). Unsubstituted 195a, monoalkylated phenols 195b–d and sterically hindered di-tert-butylphenol 195i were unreactive towards the dioxirane protocol, cf. Table 4. These observations indicate that the steric influence in phenols needs to be fully understood, and, accordingly, it is required to enhance the reactivity of dioxirane-mediated oxidation protocol.

4.1.13. Oxidation of thiols and thiophenols. 
Unlike phenol oxidation, Gu and Harpp found thiophenols very reactive towards electrophilic 9 to produce multiple products.187 For example, when p-thiocresol (197) was treated with 9 a variety of oxidation products such as disulfide 198, sulfinic acid 199, sulfonic acid 200 and thiosulfonate 201, were formed even at −40 °C (Scheme 47a). Similarly, the oxidation of benzyl mercaptan 202 gave a variety of products. Here, sulfinic acid 204 was isolated predominantly in 71% yield (Scheme 47b). Other products like disulfide 203, sulfonic acid 205 and thiosulfonate 206 were formed in 7, 5 and 7% yield, respectively.187
 Scheme 47  Oxidations of p-thiocresol and benzyl mercaptan with DMDO 9.187 
Mechanistically, the formation of sulfinic acid 209 from 207 is proposed to go through short-lived sulfenic acid 208 (Scheme 48).182,187 Further oxidation of 209 with 9 gives sulfonic acid 210. Conversely, the formation of thiosulfonate 214 may start with disulfide formation from 211, which then reacts with 9 to give 212. Finally, 212 was oxidized to α-disulfoxide 213, which rearranged to 214.188,189 It is worth mentioning that 216 can also be formed by self-condensation of 211.187
 Scheme 48  Plausible mechanism for the oxidation of p-thiocresol and benzyl mercaptan with 9.187 
Oxidation of benzyl mercaptan 202 with 9 gave a minor amount of benzaldehyde 217, which was probably formed through sulfenic acid 215 and sulfine 216 (Scheme 49).187 Benzaldehyde (217) became a major side product at room temperature.
 Scheme 49  Plausible mechanism for the formation of benzaldehyde in benzyl mercaptan oxidation.187 
Unlike p-thiocresol and benzyl mercaptan, when aliphatic thiols 218 were treated with 9 the corresponding sulfinic acids 220 were isolated in 73–96% yield (Scheme 50).187 Oxidation was proposed to proceed through sulfenic acid 219.
 Scheme 50  Oxidation of aliphatic and aromatic thiols with DMDO.187 


4.1.14. Oxidation of phosphines, phosphine sulfides and thiophosphate. 
Phosphine oxides are very useful materials with broad spectrum applications like organo-catalysis,190,191 oxygen transfer reagents,192 OLEDs,193etc.194 The preparation of these oxides is generally carried out by the oxidation of the corresponding phosphines. During the initial phase of the development of dioxirane, Murray and Jeyaraman reported the 9-mediated oxidation of triphenylphosphine (221) to corresponding phosphine oxide 222 in 1985 (Scheme 51a).3 The same reaction was also performed by generating 9in situ using acetone and Oxone® (∼13 equiv.). In 1990, Messeguer and co-workers used a similar protocol for the oxidation of phosphine sulfides 223 and thiophosphates 225 to corresponding phosphine oxide 224 and phosphates 226, respectively (Scheme 51b and c); such compounds are particularly important for toxicological and environmental studies.195
 Scheme 51  Oxidation of triphenyl phosphine, phosphine sulfides and thiophosphate using DMDO 9.3,195 


4.1.15. Oxidation of transition metal complexes and applications. 
Dioxiranes are also used in organometallic chemistry for the oxidation of transition metal complexes. For example, Wolowiec and Kochi demonstrated the 9-promoted oxidative decarbonylation of rhenium complex 227 to trioxide 228 (Scheme 52a).196 Similarly, 10 was employed for the oxidation of niobium vinylidene complex 229 to oxirane 230 (Scheme 52b),197 whereas oxidants like H2O2, mCPBA, iodosobenzene 178 and O2 were not active for the same transformation.
 Scheme 52  Dioxirane mediated oxidations of transition metal complexes.196,197 
In 1997, Schenk et al. observed the heteroatom oxidation of ligands present on metal complexes.198 For instance, the thioether ligand of ruthenium complex 231 was oxidized by 9 (4 equiv.) to the corresponding chiral sulfoxide 232 with high d.r. (>86%) without disturbing the Ru–S bond (Scheme 53). In addition, dioxiranes were explored for the oxidation of transition metals like Pt199 and Mn200 present in organometallic and metallo-organic complexes. In 1996, Adam et al. used dioxirane to generate Jacobson's catalyst.200 Such salen catalysts are well-known for enantioselective epoxidations.201–203 The chiral salen catalyst 233 (vide infra) was in situ generated using 9 as the terminal oxidant and explored further for asymmetric epoxidation reactions.200,204,205 Thus, when chromenes (234) were subjected to oxidation, the corresponding epoxides (235/236) were isolated in 62–85% yield with very good enantioselectivity (83–93% ee) (Scheme 54a).200 This protocol gave access to both enantiomers of epoxides by employing either the R,R-Mn(III) or S,S-Mn(III) isomer of catalyst 233 (10–20 mol%). Furthermore, under similar reaction conditions, isoflavones 237 afforded epoxides 238/239 in 18–92% yield with 22–90% ee (Scheme 54b).204,205
 Scheme 53  DMDO-mediated oxidations of transition metal complexes.198 
 Scheme 54  Epoxidation of chromenes and isoflavones with Jacobson's catalyst/DMDO system.200,204,205 

  Mechanistically, the Mn(III)-catalyst 233 was in situ oxidized by 9 to Mn(V)-species 240, the latter then performed the epoxidation (Scheme 55). The enantioselectivity obtained was proposed to occur due to the top approach of the olefin to the Mn(V) complex, which was assisted by the steric effect of tert-butyl groups present on the catalyst.200
 Scheme 55  
In situ generation of Mn(V) species and its applications for enantioselective epoxidation.200 

4.2. Epoxidation of alkenes/arenes
Epoxidation of an olefin is a reaction of paramount importance in organic synthesis as the end product, epoxide (1,2-synthon), can have two stereogenic centers.206,207 The last four decades have witnessed remarkable developments in epoxidation methodologies, which include both stoichiometric and catalytic oxidation methodologies.208
In 1979, Edward et al. employed 9 for the first time to perform the epoxidation of alkenes (Scheme 3).39 In addition, Curci et al. explored the caroate–acetone system under different conditions (such as A, A′, B, B′, B′′ and B′′′ conditions), to achieve an optimal yield of the desired epoxides (Scheme 56).44 For conditions A and A′, i.e., with and without acetone, alkene 241 gave epoxide 242 in 97 and 96% GC yield with 99 and 52% conversion, respectively (Scheme 56).
 Scheme 56  DMDO-mediated epoxidation of aliphatic olefins under various conditions.44 
Thus, epoxidation could also be done with Oxone® in the absence of acetone, but the conversions were poor.44 It is worth mentioning that 241 had a ketone substituent. When conditions B, i.e., EDTA instead of 18-crown-6, were used for the oxidation of cyclododecene (243) and 1-dodecene (245) the corresponding epoxides 244 and 246 were isolated in 85 and 72% yield with 90 and 60% conversions, respectively. Further employment of conditions B, B′, B′′, and B′′′ for the oxidation of cyclohexene (247) led to interesting results. While epoxidation was negligible without acetone (conditions B′), 97% conversion with 80% GC yield was achieved with conditions B′′′. Among all conditions, conditions B afforded 248 in a yield of 98%, although the conversion was only 80%.44
In 1988, Baumstark et al. employed 9 (1.1 equiv.) for both mono- and disubstituted aliphatic and aryl alkenes in acetone where the desired products were isolated in excellent yields.67 While the reactivity of cis-dialkylalkenes was found to be higher than the trans-analogs, alkenes with aryl-substituents showed similar epoxidation rates for cis and trans derivatives. It is worth mentioning that the reaction of caroate and olefin produces the epoxide at high pH, where a buffer solution is required to overcome the acidity of the caroate solution.209 Conversely, when reactions are performed with caroate in acidic media the epoxides undergo ring-opening to produce 1,2-diols.209–211 The reaction conditions for epoxidation with dioxiranes can be very mild. For example, when benzvalene (249) was oxidized with 9, epoxide 250 (labile) was formed in 62% yield (Scheme 57).212
 Scheme 57  
9-Mediated epoxidation of benzvalene.212 
Epoxidations with dioxiranes were also achievable for electron-deficient olefins like cinnamic acids (13 and 15), which were discussed previously (Scheme 3).39 Furthermore, in 1993, epoxidations of chalcones 56 with electron-rich or deficient rings were developed by the Baumstark group (Scheme 13).69
Electron-rich olefins like chromenes 251 were oxidized with dioxirane 9 by Muxworthy in 1992 (Scheme 58).1 The epoxidation was done using a stoichiometric or catalytic (generated in situ) amount of 9, where the corresponding epoxides 252 were obtained in 75–90 and 65–91% yield, respectively.
 Scheme 58  DMDO-mediated epoxidation of chromenes.1 
Dioxiranes successfully oxidize olefins bearing both electron-donating and withdrawing groups,213,214 for example, Adam and Hadjiarapoglou performed the epoxidation of β-enol ethers (253, 255 and 257) with 9 to epoxides (254, 256 and 258) in 98–100% isolated yield (Scheme 59).215 The Yang group employed 10 (in situ generated from 81) to prepare epoxide 260 from flavone 259 in 99% isolated yield (Scheme 59).216
 Scheme 59  Epoxidation of electron-deficient vinyl ethers to β-enol ethers using 9 and 10.215,216 
Epoxidations were also explored with other ketones used as dioxirane precursors. The Denmark217,218 and Yang219 groups studied a series of ketone catalysts (vide infra) for the epoxidation of olefins. In 1990, Messeguer and co-workers used a similar protocol for the oxidation of phosphine sulfides 223 and thiophosphates 225 to the corresponding phosphine oxide 224 and phosphates 226, respectively (Scheme 51b and c); such compounds are particularly important for toxicological and environmental studies.195

  In 1997, Denmark et al. explored 1,1,1-trifluorodecanone as a substitute for the acetone catalyst,220 where the latter exhibited higher reactivity. In 2003, Li and Fuchs reported a catalytic epoxidation using fluorinated acetophenones with Oxone® as a terminal oxidant.221 This protocol had benefits as a minimum of co-oxidant was employed here. Similarly, Kan and Toy reported epoxidation using poly(ethylene glycol)-supported α,α,α-trifluoroacetophenone as a catalyst,222 which was found to be an effective homogeneous catalyst for the epoxidation of a variety of olefins, and readily recovered and recycled after the reaction.

4.2.1. Epoxidation with a polymeric dioxirane. 
Polydioxirane (PDOX) is a dioxirane-bearing polymer developed by Kazemnejadi et al. in 2018.223 PDOX 275, a shelf-stable compound, was generated in situ from polysalicylaldehyde (PSA, 274, 0.5 g) and Oxone® (Scheme 60). The synthesis of PDOX began from salicylaldehyde (272), first formylation to 273 followed by polycondensation with 274, and finally, oxidation with Oxone® (10 mmol) in the presence of NaHCO3 (10 mmol) led to polymer 275, the latter exhibited substantial improvements compared to 9 in terms of stability, recyclability, and reactivity in aqueous media223 For example, 275 was stable at room temperature for up to 1 week, and could be recycled up to 8 times without any loss of reactivity, and removable by simple filtration. The generation of 275 from 274 was observed by 1H NMR analysis, and it was further supported by UV-visible and thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis.223 Both stoichiometric and catalytic procedures were very effective for the epoxidation of a range of olefins 276 to epoxides 277 in 61–97 and 62–97% isolated yield, respectively (Scheme 60).223
 Scheme 60  Synthesis of polymeric dioxirane and its application in epoxidation.223 


4.2.2. Epoxidation of aromatics, polycyclic aromatics and fullerenes. 
The oxidation of aromatic and polyaromatic compounds produces important useful products.106,224–227 Jeyaraman and Murray employed 9 (in situ) for the oxidation of arenes in the presence of a PTC at pH ∼ 7.5–8.5 (Scheme 61).228 Phenanthrene (278), pyrene (280) and naphthalene (282) produced epoxy products, whereas anthracene (284) gave oxidation product 9,10-anthraquinone (285).228 Furthermore, in 1989, Agarwal et al. employed 9 (stoichiometric) to prepare epoxides of various polyaromatic compounds.229 Similarly, in 1997, Murray and Singh oxidized acenaphthene with 9 where the epoxide was obtained in 97% yield.230 In addition, treatment of 9 with furan produced the ring-opening product, i.e., malealdehyde, in 95% yield,231,232 whereas in the case of thiofuran, sulfur oxidation233 was observed, which gave thiophene 1,1-dioxide in 20–30% yield.
 Scheme 61  Epoxidation and oxidation of PAHs.228 
However, under the above catalytic conditions (cf.Scheme 61), benzene remained unreacted.228 Conversely, benzene (286) could be oxidized successfully with 10 (stoichiometric) into a mixture of (Z,Z) and (E,E) hexa-2,4-dienedials (287 and 288 in 1:1.15 ratio) in 35% overall isolated yield (Scheme 62).234
 Scheme 62  Epoxidation benzene with TFDO.234 
Similarly, dioxirane 10 oxidized the electron-rich ring (A) in lactam 289 producing ring-opened muconic diester 290 in 90% yield (Scheme 63).235 The chemoselective arene oxidation in this case was proposed to occur through an epoxidation step.
 Scheme 63  Chemoselective epoxidation of an electron-rich arene with 10.235 
Along with benzene, 10 (1.8 equiv.) could oxidize 278, 280, 282 and 284 in a facile manner to 279, 281, 283 and 285 in 96, 10, 98 and 80% yield, respectively.234 The efficiency of oxidation was found to increase from naphthalene (282) to phenanthrene (278), whereas a drastic drop in oxidation was observed for the oxidation of anthracene (284) to pyrene (280). NMR studies during the oxidation of 280 at −20 °C confirmed the decomposition of 10 to 64 (∼6% after 48 h), which was proposed to proceed by a radical process (Scheme 64).4,75 The mechanism was supported by ESR studies, where the green solution of 10 and 280 produced a poorly resolved ESR spectrum similar to that of a pyreneyl radical cation.236 Although 9 remained unreactive towards benzene, it could readily react with electron-rich arenes like phenols and higher hydroxy arenes (cf. Section 4.1.14).183

In 1995, Mohler et al. successfully conducted triepoxidation of tris(benzocyclobutadieno)cyclo-hexatriene (293) employing in situ generated 9.228 The triepoxide 294 was isolated in 84% yield (Scheme 65).237
 Scheme 65  Trisoxacyclopropanation of cyclohexatriene by in situ generating dioxirane 9.237 
In 1992, Elemes et al. performed the epoxidation of fullerene C60 (295) using 9 (0.98 equiv.); oxidation led to the epoxide 296 and 1,3-dioxolane 297 in 8.6 and 11.5% yield, respectively (Scheme 66a).238 In contrast, when more reactive dioxirane 10 (4 equiv.) was employed, mono- and diepoxides (296 and 298) were obtained in 20 and 21% yield, respectively. Other side products isomeric to C60O2 and C60O3 were also obtained (Scheme 66b).239

4.2.3. Stereospecific epoxidation. 
Edward et al. performed the stereospecific epoxidation of cis- and trans-cinnamic acids (13 and 15) to corresponding cis- and trans-epoxides (14 and 16) in 90% and 95% yield, respectively, using 9 (Scheme 3).39 For all oxidations a large excess of caroate 12 was used to compensate for oxidant loss due to the competing peroxide decomposition. With an increase in the pH, the yield of the epoxidation decreases.39 Without acetone, the reaction with Oxone® gave little or no epoxidation product. Similarly, in 1980, Curci et al. explored the caroate–acetone system (conditions B, Scheme 56), under bi-phasic conditions, and stereospecifically oxidized 15 to 16 in 92% yield with 98% conversion.44


4.2.4. Chemoselective epoxidation. 
Dioxirane-mediated epoxidation can tolerate a wide range of functional groups such as protected amines,240,241 alcohols,242 nitriles,1 silanes,243 and even alkynes.242
4.2.4.1. Effect of hindrance in the chemoselective epoxidation of olefin vs. alcohol oxidation. 
The chemoselective epoxidation of a gem-disubstituted terminal alkene in a conjugated en–yn–ol system was reported by Wang et al. in 1994, where olefin 299 formed epoxide 300 in excellent yield (Scheme 67).242
 Scheme 67  Chemoselective epoxidation of olefins.242 
However, the oxidation of an alcohol was preferred in the presence of a sterically hindered alkene. For example, the alcohol group in 301 was oxidized instead of alkene epoxidation to form ketone 302 (Scheme 68a). Similarly, for acyclic allylic alcohols 303, when ‘R’ was a silyl group, ketone 304 was the major product upon oxidation (Scheme 68b). However, when R = H (303), enone product 305 was obtained predominantly in >95% yield.243
 Scheme 68  Epoxidation of allylic alkenes vs. alcohol oxidation.242 
Similarly, sterically hindered stannylated allylic alcohol 306 gave epoxide 308 as a minor product, whereas alcohol oxidation product 307 was predominant (Scheme 68c).243 Thus, steric effects at the vinyl position were very important to switch epoxidation to C–H oxidation and vice versa.
4.2.4.2. Effect of steric hindrance in the chemoselective epoxidation of olefins vs. C–H oxidation. 
In 1991, when Maynard and Paquette treated (Z)-hex-3-ene-3,4-diylbis(trimethylsilane) (309) with 9, epoxide 310 was obtained quantitatively (Scheme 69a).244 However, for its cyclic analog 311, oxidation of an allylic methyl group to carboxylic acid 312 was observed via C–H oxygenation through an aldehyde intermediate (Scheme 69b).244
 Scheme 69  DMDO-mediated epoxidation of acyclic and cyclic bisvinylsilanes.244 
In 1995, Adam et al. oxidized acyclic vinylsilanes 313 using 9 to corresponding α,β-epoxysilanes 314 in more than 95% yield (Scheme 70a).243 However, when the cyclic vinylsilane 315 was treated with 9, corresponding epoxide 316 was formed as the major product (80–100% yield) along with allylic C–H oxygenation products 317 and 318 as minor products in 6–11 and 4–20% yield, respectively (Scheme 70b); substrate 315a–d is a representative case.243
 Scheme 70  Epoxidation of acyclic and cyclic vinylsilanes to α,β-epoxysilanes.243 
When a mixture of cyclohexene (247) and 315b (1:1 molar ratio) was treated with 9 (1 equiv.) at rt, the former reacted faster and was consumed in an 87:13 ratio to 315b, suggesting that the steric hindrance in 315b reduced its reactivity compared to 247.243 Tetra-substituted cyclic vinylsilane 315d, more sterically encumbered, led to the formation of the epoxide 316d only; no allyl-oxygenated products (317d and 318d) were formed (Scheme 70b).
4.2.4.3. Chemoselective epoxidation of N-heteroatom containing olefins. 
The reaction of 9 with olefins bearing nitrogen substituents was found to be very chemoselective towards N-oxidation (Schemes 34 and 36),132 rendering it challenging to perform epoxidation in the presence of an N-heteroatom. In this regard, the Asensio245 and Ferrer240 groups reported a method to perform the epoxidation of amine-containing olefins by initial acidification/protonation of the amine group. A similar procedure was adopted earlier by Adam and co-workers for the 10-mediated C–H hydroxylation of alkanes.246
Asensio et al. in their methodology initially protected primary and secondary amines by simple protonation with p-methyl benzene sulfonic acids or p-chlorobenzene sulfonic acid, then treated protected amine with 9 to form epoxides in 60–96% isolated yield (Scheme 71).245 Oxidation of terminal alkene hex-5-en-1-amine (323) gave corresponding epoxide 324 in 90% yield (Scheme 71c), whereas internal olefins (319 and 321) produced epoxides (320 and 322) in 81–96% yield (Scheme 71a and b). Furthermore, epoxides of cycloalkanes (326, 328, and 330) were also prepared using this protocol (Scheme 71d–f). With both terminal and cyclic alkenes present in a molecule (327), the latter group underwent epoxidation selectively producing 328 (Scheme 71e). These reactions worked more efficiently with 10 compared to 9.245
 Scheme 71  Chemoselective epoxidation of olefins by protecting primary and secondary amines.245 
Ferrer et al. in 1995 performed the chemoselective oxidation of tertiary amines in the presence of a Lewis acid.240 When olefin 331 with a pyrrolidine substituent was treated with BF3·Et2O followed by 9, corresponding epoxide 332 was formed in 85% yield (Scheme 72a). Using this method, epoxide 334 with a pyridine moiety was prepared from 333 in >95% yield (Scheme 72b).240
 Scheme 72  Chemoselective epoxidation of olefins by protecting amines with a Lewis acid.240 
Amine protection by the benzoylation reaction was used by Murray and co-workers for chemoselective epoxidation.241 In 1999, Adam et al. successfully isolated epoxy-product 335 when treating 9 with lactam 289 (Scheme 73).235 Notably, in this case, the epoxide of muconic ester 336 was also formed as a minor product.
 Scheme 73  Chemoselective epoxidation of olefin with 9 for a lactam.235 
The same group further employed N-silyl-protected cyclic and acyclic enamine 337 as a substrate for epoxidation with 9.247 However, the labile α-amino epoxide 338 (observed by NMR at −30 °C) was rearranged to the corresponding ketone 339 in this case (Scheme 74).247
 Scheme 74  Epoxidation of olefins in the presence of N-silyl protected amines.247 
Chemoselectivity for the epoxidations was not observed for cyclic and acyclic enol thioethers, instead, S-oxidations led to sulfoxides and sulfones.248 Likewise for amines, the development of a chemoselective protocol for epoxidation is still in demand.


4.2.5. Regioselective epoxidation. 
In 1980, Curci et al. observed regioselective epoxidation for γ-vinyl acrylic acid 340 under conditions A (cf.Scheme 56), where the selective epoxidation of a relatively electron-rich γ,δ-olefin center was observed over an electron-deficient α,β-alkene producing epoxide 341 in 86% yield (Scheme 75).44 The same group further demonstrated both chemo- and regioselective epoxidation of allyl alcohols with 1,5-diene in 1982.249 When geraniol (342) was treated with 9 (conditions B′′′, cf. Scheme 56), this led to the formation of three kinds of epoxides (Scheme 76). Diepoxide 345 was formed in 68% yield, while the monoepoxides 343 and 344 were formed in 2 and 30% yield, respectively. However, under a moderate conversion of 40%, epoxidation of the isolated olefin (i.e., non-allylic Δ6,7) was observed selectively leading to 344 in 69% yield, whereas 343 and 345 were isolated in 10 and 21% yield, respectively.249 These results indicated that 9 was selective towards the oxidation of isolated olefins. However, at higher conversion, 9 could further oxidize both 343 and 344 to 345.
 Scheme 75  Regioselective epoxidation of (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid.44 
 Scheme 76  Regioselective epoxidation of (2E,4E)-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid.249 
The oxidation of 342 with 9 was also solvent dependent250 where 344 was obtained as the major product in solvents like acetone–MeOH (1:9, v/v), acetone and acetone:CCl4 (1:9, v/v). Oxidation with 0.3 equiv. of 9 in these solvents led to 27, 28 and 27% conversions, where 344 and 343 were formed in 88:12, 74:26 and 51:49 ratios, respectively. In the presence of 1 equiv. of 9 in acetone, epoxides 344 and 343 were formed in a 73:17 ratio with 93% conversion,250 and 345 was produced in 10% yield. The same reaction with an excess of 9 (5 equiv.) led to >95% conversion forming 345 exclusively (95% yield). Alternatively, the reaction with 10 (0.3 equiv.) gave epoxides 344 and 343 in 73:27, 68:32 and 57:43 ratios, respectively, in the corresponding solvents of TFP–MeOH (1:9, v/v), TFP and TFP:CCl4 (1:9, v/v).251 The increase in selectivity towards 343 when moving from polar to non-polar solvents was attributed to inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding.251


4.2.6. Stereoselective epoxidation. 
Stereo-controlled epoxidations are important for accessing chiral compounds for asymmetric applications like drug and natural product synthesis. In this regard, in 1982, Curci et al. developed a stereoselective protocol for the epoxidation of cyclic allylic alcohols using 9 (in situ, conditions B′′′, cf. Scheme 56).249 The oxidation of cyclic allylic alcohols with eight and ten membered rings (346 and 349, respectively) produced trans-epoxides 348 and 351 in 99 and 71% yield, respectively (Scheme 77a and b). However, β-hydroxycholesterol (352) produced cis-5,6β- and trans-5,6α-oxides (358 and 359, respectively) in a 78:22 ratio under similar conditions (Scheme 77c).249
 Scheme 77  Stereoselective and enantioselective epoxidation of allylic alcohols.249 
The selectivity towards the formation of 353 might be due to the higher possibility of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between 352 and 9.243 In this regard, Adam and co-workers studied diastereoselective solvent-dependent epoxidation (in protic and aprotic medium) using dioxiranes 9 and 10 (Scheme 78).250
 Scheme 78  Diastereoselective epoxidation of allylic olefins with dioxiranes 9250 and 10.251 
For the allyl alcohols 355a–g, with or without 1,2 or 1,3 allylic strains, and irrespective of the nature of the solvent medium, threo-epoxides 356a–g were formed as major products upon reaction with 10, whereas the reactions of 355c with 10 were the only exceptions, cf. Table 5, entries 10 and 11. For 355a, without allylic strain, reaction with 9 gave epoxides (356a and 356b) with no diastereoselectivity (d.r. = 50:50),250 whereas 10 produced a 55:45 ratio of threo:erythro isomers.251 The type of allylic strain was very important. For example, the olefins 355b with 1,2-allylic strain (entries 3–7) and 355c with 1,3-allylic strain (entries 8–9) exhibited higher diastereoselectivity compared to 355a (entry 1). Furthermore, the incorporation of an additional methyl group enhanced the selectivity. For instance, compared to 355d and. 355e (entries 12–21), 355f and 355g exhibited higher d.r. (entries 22–28); the diastereoselectivity of 355g was the best, i.e., 95:5 d.r. Furthermore, olefins with allylic strain (355b and 355d–g) showed higher diastereoselectivity with a decreasing solvent polarity, e.g., the order of d.r.: P > Q > R. A dipolar transition state was proposed for the epoxidation that was assisted by H-bonding to facilitate threo epoxidation.250 The polar protic solvent stabilizes the dipolar transition state by allowing intermolecular H-bond formation.

When conformationally-locked allylic cyclohexanol 358 was treated with 9 (0.08 M acetone) in CCl4, epoxidation was observed cis to the hydroxy group affording cis- and trans-epoxides in a ratio of 82:18% (Scheme 79).252,253 This selectivity was due to the aprotic solvent used in the reaction, which allowed intramolecular hydrogen bonding between 9 and the hydroxy group of 358. Alternatively, when a polar protic solvent (methanol) was used, trans-isomer 360 became the major product.252
 Scheme 79  Stereoselective epoxidation of cyclohexenol.252 
The effect of 1,3-allylic strain was studied for 3-alkyl substituted cyclohexene.241,253 Here, with bulky substituents on the cyclohexene ring, the formation of the trans epoxide was facilitated over cis-oxygenation (Scheme 80). For example, with an increase in the size of an alkyl group (361a–e) in cyclohexene the ratio of trans:cis epoxide increased. However, with an increase in steric hindrance of dioxiranes employed in the reaction, no or negligible change in the diastereoselectivity was observed.254
 Scheme 80  Effect of allylic sterics on the epoxidation of cyclohexenol.241,253 
4.2.6.1. Shi epoxidation. 
Shi et al. developed chiral aliphatic cyclic ketones, and in situ generated chiral dioxiranes to explore asymmetric transformations; among all transformations, epoxidation is very popular and known as Shi's epoxidation.16,255–257 Chiral dioxiranes were in situ generated from ketones (96, 364 and 365, vide infra) and explored for asymmetric epoxidation.
Catalyst 96 was most effective for the epoxidation of various alkenes 366 (Scheme 81).255 The highest enantioselectivity was observed for 1,2-disubstituted olefins (87–97% ee), whereas terminal alkenes gave poor enantioselectivities, i.e., 13–35% ee. Sterically hindered trisubstituted olefins showed good enantioselectivities, i.e., 76–97.7% ee. However, the enantioselectivity was comparatively poorer for cis-disubstituted olefins, where only 19.6–56.2% ee was achieved. Furthermore, epoxidation with the enantiomer of α-methylene 96 produced epoxides with similar enantioselectivity (like 96), but with the opposite conformation.
 Scheme 81  Shi epoxidation of ketones.255 

  Temperature plays an important role in the Shi epoxidation. For example, with a temperature increase from −11 to 30 °C, the enantioselectivity for the epoxidation of trans-β-methyl styrene decreased from 95.7 to 91.1% ee, respectively (vide infra). The epoxidation was also dependent on the vinyl substituents. Cyclohexene 368a with a bulky substituent displayed lower enantioselectivity (26% ee) in epoxidation compared to 368c (81% ee) with a smaller substituent, whereas the enantioselectivity was highest with 368d. It was further noticed that a decrease in the size of the gem-vinyl substituents and an increase in the size of vicinal-vinyl substituents enhanced the enantioselectivity. Olefin 370 offered higher enantioselectivity during epoxidation than 369c, 96.8 vs. 76.4% ee, respectively.

  Epoxidation was proposed to proceed through adducts 371 and 372 (Scheme 82).255 Adduct 371 first decomposed to generate the dioxirane intermediate 373, which performed the epoxidation of olefin 366, producing epoxide 367 and regenerating ketone 96. The adduct 371 also underwent side reactions such as BVO that produced lactones 374 and 375 during the reaction cycle.255
 Scheme 82  Plausible pathways of the ketone 96 catalyzed epoxidation.255 
The epoxidation of cis-olefins gave very poor enantioselectivity.255 It was proposed that the catalyst could not provide the required conformational features to incorporate asymmetric discrimination. To address this, in 2000 the Shi group came up with a new catalyst, 376, an N-analog of 96.257 Using this catalyst, the enantioselective epoxidation of cis-olefins could be achieved successfully in up to 97% ee (Scheme 83).
 Scheme 83  Regio- and enantioselective epoxidation of conjugated cis-olefins.257 
In 2006, Shi and Burke further explored oxazolidinone and glucose-based catalysts (376 and 379–381) for regio- and enantioselective epoxidation of conjugated olefins 377 with both Z- and E-configurations (Scheme 84).258 These catalysts were very effective in producing epoxides 378 in 47–80% yield (1H NMR) with 76–94% ee. The epoxidation was regioselective. The reactivity of the Z-olefin was greater than the E-olefin at −10 °C.258
 Scheme 84  Epoxidation of conjugated olefins in regio- and enantioselective fashion.258 
In 2007, the same group used glucose-derived catalysts 379 and 382 in the epoxidation of cis-enynes 383 in high chemo- and enantioselectivity (Scheme 85). The reaction afforded cis-propargyl epoxides 384 in 46–84% yield (1H NMR) in up to 97% ee.259 Possibly the alkyne and its substituents interact with the oxazolidinone moiety of the dioxirane catalysts derived from 379 and 382, which leads to stereo-differentiation.259
 Scheme 85  Epoxidation of conjugated cis-enynes in a chemo- and enantioselective fashion.259 
Wang and Shi found the 96-catalyzed epoxidation of hydroxyalkenes to be highly pH-dependent.260 At lower pH, direct epoxidation by Oxone® resulted in lower enantioselectivity,209,261 whereas at higher pH epoxidation with a chiral ketone prevails producing the corresponding epoxides with higher enantioselectivity (>90% ee).260
4.2.6.2. Epoxidation with a chiral dioxirane on a peptide scaffold. 
In 2012, Romney and Miller generated a chiral proline-based dioxirane in situ from 385 and H2O2,262 which was useful for the asymmetric epoxidation of olefins 358. The yields and diastereomeric ratio of the desired epoxides 367 were up to 89% and 91:9, respectively (Scheme 86a). The same group in 2016 further developed a peptide-based dioxirane 388 with a fluoroarene scaffold,263 the synthesis of which involved the conversion of acid 386 into amide 387. The latter was then oxidized to dioxirane 388 (Scheme 86b). The reaction of vinyl-arenes with in situ generated 388 led to the respective epoxides with up to 99% conversion. Precursor 387 had high stability and was expected to have greater compatibility with biological systems, which could potentially extend the applications of dioxirane to biological systems.263
 Scheme 86  
In situ generated chiral dioxiranes on peptide scaffolds developed by the Miller group.262,263 
4.2.6.3. Epoxidation with chiral halogenated dioxiranes. 
In 1995, the Denmark group demonstrated epoxidation with achiral piperidinone derivatives (up to 96% yield) and confirmed the formation of dioxirane by 18O labelling experiments.217,218 In continuation of this work, the same group also developed a series of fluorinated ketones 389–397 (vide infra) for asymmetric epoxidations.220 Consistent with fluorinated 10 being more reactive than 9, mono-fluorinated 389 and 390 showed higher reactivity than 4-tert-butylcyclohexanones for the epoxidation of (E)-((hex-4-en-1-yloxy)methyl)benzene. The reactivity of 389 with an equatorial F-group was higher than that of 390 with an axial F-group. Difluoro analogs 391–393 exhibited higher reactivity than 4-tert-butylcyclohexanones as well. However, the reactivity of 390 and 391 with axial fluorine groups decreased compared to 389. Alternatively, with two equatorial F-groups, 392 was found to be more reactive than 389. Thus, it can be concluded that the axial fluorine group reduces the reactivity whereas equatorial substitution increases the rate. Similarly, for chiral tropinium triflates, while 394 gave very poor conversion, equatorial fluoro analog 395 produced epoxide 399 in 85% yield with 65% ee (Scheme 87).220 In 1998, Armstrong and Hayter found that fluoro-catalyst 397 was more efficient for epoxidation than non-fluoro 396,264 where the catalyst could be recovered and recycled.
 Scheme 87  Tropinium triflate based chiral catalyst for the epoxidation of stilbene.264 

  In 1995, Yang and co-workers initially developed non-halogenated C2 symmetric binaphthalene-based ketone 400, which successfully executed asymmetric epoxidations (vide infra).265 In 1998, the same group studied a series of chiral halogenated cyclohexanones 401–405 bearing α-chloro ketones.266 Crystal structure analysis of 402 suggested that the dioxiranes 401–405 had a consistent conformation with equatorial alkyl groups.

  The epoxidation of substituted trans-stilbenes catalyzed by chiral (2S,5R)-ketones 401–405 produced (S,S)-epoxides selectively as the major products with 42–89% ee. Among all catalysts, fluoro-derivative 401 was the most reactive, whereas H-derivative 405 was the least reactive. It was proposed that the obtained enantioselectivity was due to a spiro-transition state formed between the chiral dioxirane and olefin. The spiro transition state formed via an equatorial approach was proposed to be favorable over that formed by an axial attack (Scheme 88). In the latter case, the olefin experienced steric hindrance from protons H-3 and H-5 due to 1,3-diaxial interactions.266 Furthermore, the equatorial approach could occur through the transition states 407 or 408, where the latter was less favorable due to steric repulsion between axial-Cl atom and stilbene. Thus, the reaction of stilbene proceeded through 407, which facilitated the formation of the (S,S)-epoxide. For instance, when trans-stilbene was treated with in situ generated dioxirane produced from 402, the (S,S)-epoxide was isolated in 85.9% ee. Similarly, the epoxidation of 3,3′- and 4,4′-substituted trans-stilbenes afforded (S,S)-epoxides with reasonable enantioselectivities (72–89% ee).
 Scheme 88  Proposed spiro transition states for asymmetric epoxidation of trans-stilbene.266 
Molecular model-based investigations found that the Cl-atom in 407 (X = Cl) was in close proximity to the dioxirane, and, thus, the steric effect between the Cl-atom and m- or p-substituents of stilbene was not considered.266,267 The stereoelectronic properties were studied, where linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis for electron-rich stilbenes for Hammett substituent constants σm and σp produced reaction constants ρm and ρp of −0.84 and −0.86, respectively. The presence of a negative slope indicated an n–π electronic repulsion, which was further supported by calculations for 407. However, such an effect was missing in transition state 408. For electron-rich olefins, such repulsion is very high and influences the enantioselectivities. In support of this, when the enantiomer of 402, i.e., 406, was employed as a catalyst for the epoxidation of 398, the corresponding (S,S)-epoxide was obtained with a lower enantioselectivity of only 32% ee.266 The decrease in the catalytic reactivity from F- to H-atom substituted ketone indicated that the electronegative substituent stabilized 407. Thus, the stereo-electronic effect is crucial in designing an efficient catalyst.

In 1993, Adam et al. reported the low-temperature regio-isomeric oxidation of methoxy-substituted benzofurans 409 by 9.268 Oxidation of 409 afforded labile epoxides 410 that equilibrated with o-quinone methides (o-QM, 411) through valence isomerization (Scheme 89). Photochemical cyclization of 411 afforded benzoxetene 412 that slowly reverted to the same equilibrium mixtures of 410 and 411. This mixture isomerized thermally to allylic alcohol 413 and its ring-opened phenolic tautomer 414. To the mixture of 410, 411, and 412, nucleophiles like MeOH can be added, yielding 417 and its tautomer 418. Similarly, an inverse Diels–Alder reaction with 415 gave cycloadduct 416, and 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with 419 led to 420.268

In 1994, Adam and Sauter studied the substituent effect of benzofurans for 9-mediated epoxidation.269 When an alcohol residue was present on the furan moiety (421), oxidation led to 426 instead of 421 undergoing epoxidation (Scheme 90).109,269 However, an unsubstituted C3-position on benzofuran (R1 = Me, R2 = H) gave C-2/C-3 cleaved product 423. Here, the additional oxygen was proposed to be donated by 9, which added to the initially formed epoxide. However, when both C2 and C3 were substituted, 1,2-hydrogen or alkyl migration was observed forming benzofuranones 424 regardless of the substituent's electronic character. However, sterically hindered benzofuran (R1 = tBu, R2 = Me) afforded stable epoxide 425, which did not react further.

In 2015, More and Ramana showed intramolecular cycloaddition of o-QMs with a carbonyl group present on the C2-aryl group that successfully led to the [6,6,6,6]-tetracyclic scaffold, which is present abundantly in integrastatins, epicoccolide A, and epicocconigrone A.270,271In situ generated 9 produced o-QMs by the oxidative dearomatization of C2-(aryl)benzofurans 427 and 429, and an oxidative cascade involving the intramolecular addition of a suitably positioned ketone or olefin produced 428 and 430, respectively (Scheme 91).
 Scheme 91  Synthesis of integrastatins through an oxidation cascade using 9 (in situ).270,271 
This synthesis is a short pathway to access 16 different integrastatins.270,271 For example, integrastatins were reported via 11 steps in 2003,272 and 6 steps in 2011.273 These compounds with a central [3,3,1]-bicyclic ketal core are known to exhibit anti-HIV activity.274
4.2.7.2. Dimethyldioxirane-mediated oxidation of indole derivatives. 
Direct oxidation of N-protected indole 431 with deuterated 9 (DMDO-d6) produced labile epoxides 432 that readily underwent thermolysis through carbocation intermediates 433 and 434 (Scheme 92).275 The electron-donating substituents provided stability for epoxide ring-opening at the C-2 position (in 433) to produce allylic alcohol 435 (indoline) via hydrogen abstraction. In the absence of electronic stabilization, ring-opening is preferred at the C-3 center (in 434) for the following reasons: (1) epoxide C–O bonds differ in lengths as indicated by X-ray analysis; (2) the C-3 position exhibits benzylic resonance stabilization effects. A facile alkyl shift pathway was then assumed to generate indolinones 436 as a major product.275

4.2.8. Epoxidation with a special class of dioxirane with a heteroatom. 
When a carbon atom of the 3-membered dioxirane ring is replaced with a heteroatom like N, P, Si, S, etc., it becomes a heteroatom dioxirane.276 In 2003, Ho and co-workers synthesized phosphadioxirane 438 from tris(o-methoxyphenyl) phosphine (437) upon treatment with singlet oxygen at −80 °C in CH2Cl2 (Scheme 93).277,278 This in situ generated oxene-like species was thoroughly characterized by 31P and 17O NMR analysis.277 Compound 438 is unstable at high temperature and decomposes to the phosphonate. Although dioxirane 438 can oxidize various olefins to epoxides in ∼54–85% yield at −80 °C, alcohol oxidation or C–H oxygenation was not possible.277
 Scheme 93  Synthesis of phosphadioxirane.277 

4.3. Oxidation/epoxidation of allenes and cumulenes
In 1988, Crandall and Batal reported the epoxidation of allenes 439 using 9 where spirodioxides 440 were formed in 44 to 95% yield (Scheme 94a).279 Furthermore, when an allenic alcohol 441 was treated with a cold solution of 9, cyclized hydroxy-tetrahydro furanone 442 was isolated in 55% yield (Scheme 94b).280,281 However, in the presence of pTSA (0.5 equiv.), tetrahydrofuran 443 was formed as the major product (Scheme 94c).53,280 When gem-disubstituted alcohol 444 was subjected to the same reaction conditions, triol 445 was formed in 89% yield (Scheme 94d).280 Similarly, allenyl carboxylic acids were successfully converted into highly functionalized lactones derivatives in up to 87% yield.282
 Scheme 94  Epoxidation of allenes279 and allenic alcohols with 9 by Crandall et al.280–282 
In 1992, the Crandall group studied the epoxidation of cumulene 446 using 9 that led to cyclopropenone 447 and 448. The former was an orange colored solid that was stable under dark conditions (Scheme 95).283 However, when exposed to light or heat, or kept in acetone solution at rt (dark), it lost carbon monoxide to form tetracene 449. Alternatively, cyclopropenone 448, which was difficult to isolate and could be detected only by NMR and FTIR analysis, was proposed as an intermediate that rearranged to 447.283
 Scheme 95  Epoxidation of cumulenes with DMDO.283 
When Pasto et al. treated bisallene 450 with 9 in acetone at rt, two cyclopentenones were formed (Scheme 96), one with an exomethylenic double bond (451), whereas the other (452) contained an exocyclic epoxide.284 However, with two or more equivalents of 9 the oxidation of 450 at rt for 24 h led to the formation of 452 as a single product.
 Scheme 96  Epoxidation of bisallene with 9.284 
4.4. Epoxidation of alkynes
Edwards and co-workers oxidized phenyl propionic acid (453) with 9 (in situ) to form phenylacetic acid (454) (Scheme 97) along with a minor amount of 2-phenylmalonic acid (457).39 The formation of the latter suggested the involvement of an oxirene intermediate 455, which underwent rearrangement to produce ketenes 456 and 458, respectively. Hydrolysis of these ketenes finally gives 457 and 454, respectively.39 Notably, 453 is unreactive towards oxidants like m-CPBA and caroate. Thus, this methodology with in situ generated 9 is very useful to perform such transformations.
 Scheme 97  Oxidation of phenylpropiolic acid with in situ generated 9.39 
Furthermore, in 1992, Curci et al. studied the oxidation of mono- and diarylsubstituted acetylenes with 9 and 10.285 Treating a 2-fold excess of the oxidant (9 or 10) with diphenylacetylene (460) gave four different products, whereas benzophenone (461) was produced as a major product in 58% and 60% yield, respectively (Scheme 98). Benzil (462) was isolated as a minor product (∼30%) along with trace amounts of carboxylic acids 463 and 464. The reaction of 460 with 10 was faster than with 9. For instance, with 10, a conversion of 82% was achieved within 6 min, whereas only 50% conversion was observed for 9 after 8 h.285 The oxidation of phenylacetylene (465) with 9 gave four different products where benzaldehyde (217) and 2-oxo-2-phenylacetic acid (466) were isolated as major and minor products, respectively. Eventually, these oxidations will also be feasible with catalytic protocols involving in situ generated 9 and 10.285
 Scheme 98  Oxidation of arylacetylenes with 9 or 10.285 
In contrast, the reactions with dialkyl substituted alkynes exhibited a different trend.285,286 While the oxidation of acyclic 467 with 9 and 10 gave α,β-unsaturated ketone 468 and 1,2-diketone 469 as major (77–78%) and minor (18–19%) products, respectively, 1,5- and 1,6-transannular insertion ketones 471 and 472 were formed in 86% and 13% yield, respectively, for cyclic alkyne 470 (Scheme 99). The latter case is a stereoselective transformation, and the reaction is proposed to proceed through a carbenoid intermediate.285
 Scheme 99  Oxidation of cyclic and acyclic dialkylacetylene with 9 or 10.285 
4.5. Kinetic resolution
Dioxiranes are sensitive toward steric effects, and a chiral center at the allylic position to a double bond will provide the required discrimination for asymmetric kinetic resolution. Frohn and co-workers used catalyst 96 for the epoxidation-assisted chiral resolution of allylic substituted racemic olefin, where selectively only one isomer of olefin was oxidized leaving the other untouched.256 For example, in the reaction of 1,2- and 1,3-substituted olefins (473 and 475) the unreacted S and R isomers, respectively, were obtained with excellent enantioselectivity, i.e., 96 and 99% ee, respectively (Scheme 100).
 Scheme 100  Kinetic resolution of allyl-OTMS cyclohexene.256 
The approach of the olefin towards the dioxirane was proposed to be more favorable through the spiro transition state.256 For, the 1,2-substituted olefin, the spiro approach of 477 was favorable over 478 (Scheme 101a), where the latter had repulsion between R2 and an oxygen of dioxirane. Similarly, for the 1,3-substituted olefin, the spiro approach of 479 was favorable over 480 (Scheme 101b).
 Scheme 101  Mechanism for the epoxidation of substituted cyclohexene.256 
4.6. C–H functionalization

4.6.1. C–H hydroxylation. 
The direct functionalization of alkanes is generally difficult. However, C–H insertion with 10 proceeds facilely.75 For such oxygenation, the order of reactivity of C–H bonds is tertiary C–H ≈ benzhydrylic C–H > R-cyclopropyl C–H > benzylic C–H ≈ secondary C–H > primary C–H.15 The alcohols produced from the oxygenation of primary and secondary C–H bonds were prone to oxidation resulting in the formation of carbonyl compounds, but could be trapped in situ.287 Similar to silanes, this methodology is useful for the functionalization of chiral alkanes with retention of configuration.108
In this regard, mono- and polyhydroxylation of adamantane with 10 were reported by Mello et al.75,288 When adamantane (191) was treated with 10 (∼1.1 equiv.) monohydroxylated product 192, i.e., adamantan-1-ol, was obtained in 94% yield,75 where 1,3-dihydroxy product 481 was obtained in only 5% yield (Scheme 102a). However, the latter was obtained as a major product (92% yield), when an excess of 10 (2 equiv.) was employed. Furthermore, an increase in the amount of 10 to 6 and 20 equiv. resulted in the formation of corresponding tri- and tetraols in 90 and 73% yield, respectively.288 Interestingly, kinetic studies revealed a 7000-fold reactivity difference between 10 and 9 for the oxidation of adamantane.288 Surprisingly, although 10 is more reactive than 9, the regio- and stereoselectivity typical of dioxirane oxidants were fully preserved, which is a clear deviation from the reactivity–selectivity principle (RSP).14 It was found that dioxirane 9 also afforded 192 selectively in 87% yield at 20 °C.289 In 1993, Teager and co-workers treated Binor-S (485) with 9 and monohydroxylated product 486 was formed in 98% yield (Scheme 102c).289,290 It is worth mentioning that the reaction of 485 with 10 (6 equiv.) led to the formation of dihydroxy-, dihydroxyketone, and trihydroxy products in 33, 39 and 5% yield, respectively.291 Notably, the α-methylene and cyclopropyl group remained undisturbed in 486. However, the α-methylene group was oxidized to ketone 483 in the case of 482 (Scheme 102b).289 When methyl ent-trachyloban-19-oate with a cyclopropyl ring was treated with 10, the C–H oxygenated product, i.e., ketone, was isolated in 43% yield.292
 Scheme 102  Hydroxylation of the tertiary C–H bond with 9 and 10.75,289 
In 2009, the Annese group showed direct mono- and bis-hydroxylation of cubane (487) using 10 (Scheme 103).293 When 487 was treated with 10 in CH2Cl2–TFP solution (90:10, v/v), cubanol (488) was obtained with a 98% GC yield. Furthermore, oxygenation with 10 selectively produced cubane-1,4-diol (489) with 95% GC yield.293 Overall, the rigid cyclopropyl group was found to be stable to 10-mediated oxygenation.294
 Scheme 103  Hydroxylation of cubane.293 
4.6.1.1. Hydroxylation of methane to methanol. 
The conversion of methane to methanol is of paramount importance in organic synthesis as the process has the potential to offer a myriad of organic compounds starting from methane. In 2011, Curci et al. treated in situ generated11810 with methane (490) to prepare methanol (491) under ambient pressure at <5 °C. The reaction was highly selective, i.e., >95%, towards the formation of methanol.295 The reaction with 10 (in situ) offered up to 15% conversion within 24 h, whereas for 9 (in situ) < 2% conversion was observed (Scheme 104). Although the oxidation with 9 (stoichiometric) showed better reactivity (5% conversion) than its catalytic protocol, the stoichiometric reactivity of 9 was still inferior compared to 10.
 Scheme 104  Oxidation of methane to methanol.295 
4.6.1.2. Selective mono-hydroxylation by in situ protection. 
Activation of primary and secondary C–H bonds proved to be feasible. However, compared to tertiary C–H bonds, a longer reaction time and a large excess of dioxirane were required. For primary and secondary C–H bond oxygenations, alcohols were generated as the initial products but were highly susceptible to further oxidation to carbonyl compounds. For example, secondary C–H oxidation afforded the ketone as the end product,109 whereas primary C–H oxidation proceeded to the carboxylic acid.244 In 1996, Asensio and co-workers were able to stop the oxidation of primary, secondary and benzylic alkanes at the monohydroxylation products in the presence of excess trifluoroacetic anhydride (Tf2O, 10-fold).287 In this case, the resulting trifluoroacetic acid ester was unreactive towards oxidation, thus, it locked the product at the monohydroxylation stage (Scheme 105a–c). The reaction protocol worked for primary 492, secondary 494 and benzylic 496 alkanes where the monotriflated products i.e., 493, 495 and 497, respectively, were obtained in >99% yield. Like 496, substrates with an activated methylene group reacted in a facile manner. For example, isochroman reacted with 9 (2 equiv.) to give isocoumarin in 65–80% within 30 min at rt.296
 Scheme 105  Oxidation of aliphatic and benzylic alkanes.287 
Although the transformation is well-established, mechanistic uncertainty for C–H oxygenation still prevails. There are a number of plausible mechanisms proposed such as concerted electrophilic oxygen insertion,12,13,297 diradical pair,298 molecule induced homolysis of dioxirane,299 and stepwise oxygen insertion.300,301 Most recently, in 2016, a DFT study by Bach addressed the mechanistic controversy by challenging the hypothesis of the electrophilic nature of dioxiranes in the activation of saturated hydrocarbons and advocated homolytic O–O cleavage as a more probable mechanism than electrophilic oxygen insertion.10 Based on activation barrier energy calculations, Bach concluded that the transition state for C–H oxidation did not exhibit an energy barrier in radical pair formation, and thus proceeded through a mechanism with a higher radical character (diradicaloid). This was in contrast to epoxidation or oxidation of lone-pair-bearing heteroatoms that favored concerted electrophilic oxygen insertion.10
4.6.1.3. Site selectivity in C–H hydroxylation. 
In 2009, Chen and Baran used 10-mediated C–H oxidations for the synthesis of eudesmane terpenes.302 Out of five tertiary C–H bonds in 498, only the single equatorial hydrogen was selectively oxidized to give 499 (Scheme 106). This site selectivity showcased the propensity for dioxirane to discriminate between C–H bonds in equatorial and axial orientation as a consequence of released strain.8,303 Given the consistent observations75,304 that equatorial C–H bonds are more reactive than axial towards oxidation irrespective of the reagent system, Baran and co-workers proposed that besides steric hindrance due to reagent approach and C–H nucleophilicity towards oxygen insertion, strain release also facilitated the reaction; the latter enhancement was driven by 1,3-diaxial strain release in the transition state where the change in the hybridization of a C-atom from sp3 to sp2 had occurred.303,305
 Scheme 106  Site selectivity in C–H hydroxylation mediated by 10.302 
In 2013, Zou and co-workers computationally investigated the site selectivity and stereoselectivity of C–H oxyfunctionalization on substituted cyclohexanes and trans-decalins by 9 using quantum mechanical DFT.8 Based on the computed activation barrier, an increase in axial substitution facilitated C–H oxidation by lowering the distortion energy. For instance, with an increase in the number of substitutions, cyclohexane substrates demonstrated the following reactivity order: 500 < 501 < 502.8

  In 2017, Yang et al. developed a novel approach to enhance site-selectivity in dioxirane-mediated C–H oxidation of substituted cyclohexanes using supramolecular control employing β- and γ-cyclodextrins (CDs).306 Here, alkane (1 equiv.) and CD (1.1 equiv.) mixtures in water were treated with in situ generated 10 at rt. γ-CD showed an appreciable influence on the site-selectivity and yield in comparison with β-CD. The observed differentiation is due to a binding geometry, wherein the mode of access towards the substrate was modified.306
4.6.1.4. C–H hydroxylation by in situ generated dioxirane catalysts. 
The first catalytic dioxirane-mediated C–H hydroxylation was introduced by Hilinski and Pierce in 2014,307 where a variety of fluorous acetophenones were screened, along with acetone 11. Among all, catalyst 506 was the most efficient (Scheme 107); this catalyst was in situ generated from 505 (20 mol%) when treated with a large excess of H2O2 (16 equiv.) in the presence of acetic acid (503) in DCE/HFIP at 70 °C.307 Mechanistically, 503 is initially oxidized to peracetic acid (504) by H2O2, then 504 transfers an oxygen to ketone 505 generating dioxirane 506. The latter then performs C–H hydroxylation of alkanes 507 chemoselectively. However, due to the limited catalytic activity of 505, the substrate scope was restricted to tertiary C–H activation of highly reactive species such as adamantane and decalin.307 In 2017, the same group developed a catalytic protocol using ketone 509, where a higher conversion rate and broader substrate scope were achieved (Scheme 108).308 Under milder neutral reaction conditions, product 508 was isolated in moderate to excellent yield. Hydroxylation of both 3° and 2° C–H bonds was feasible giving moderate to excellent yields of products, and the superior selectivity for tertiary bonds was also retained.308
 Scheme 107  Dioxirane-catalyzed C–H hydroxylation of alkanes.307 
 Scheme 108  Dioxirane-catalyzed C–H hydroxylation.308 
In 2018, Yacob et al. developed a protocol to overcome the solubility limitations of KHSO5.309 The reaction was carried out with the urea-stabilized H2O2 adduct as a terminal oxidant and a ketone catalyst in the presence of peracetic acid.309 The terminal oxidant H2O2 was used in a catalytic amount, as opposed to the 16 equiv. required for the previous report.307 Although the method displayed complete selectivity (>99%), the C–H hydroxylation product was obtained in only up to 60% yield.309 This indicates the need for further improvement in catalytic C–H hydroxylation in terms of yield and selectivity.
4.6.1.5. C–H hydroxylation by dioxiranes using flow chemistry. 
An automated flow process can also be used for in situ dioxirane generation.310 The instability of dioxirane oxidants 9 and 10 limits the scaling up of dioxirane-mediated processes due to high temperature and difficulty in maintaining constant reaction conditions over a long reaction time. The introduction of a continuous-flow protocol to in situ generate dioxiranes can partly address these limitations and offer synthetic advantages including improved reactivity, scalability, and safe handling of sensitive reagents. For example, for the gram scale oxidation of 191, 93% conversion to 192 was achieved in 80 s at room temperature using flow chemistry (Scheme 109).311 Similarly, epoxidation of terpenes was also completed in 4 to 8 min with quantitative yields under ultrasonic agitation.312 Dioxirane-mediated reactions under continuous flow conditions were useful for performing transformations including the oxidation of tertiary and secondary C–H bonds, alcohols, natural products, etc.311

4.6.2. Regioselective intramolecular oxidative transformations. 
4.6.2.1. Regioselective intramolecular oxygenation and cyclization of unactivated secondary and tertiary C–H bonds. 
In 1998, Yang and co-workers reported the regioselective intramolecular oxygenation of unactivated C–H bonds by dioxiranes (in situ).313 The oxidation of the unactivated δ C–H bond of the ketone in 510 was observed when treated with Oxone®/NaHCO3 in an aqueous acetonitrile medium at rt (Scheme 110a). A mixture of the cyclic hemiacetal products 513 as well as the acyclic δ-hydroxylated products 514 was observed (Scheme 110b). This reaction was very regioselective. For example, the δ secondary C–H bond was selectively oxygenated in the presence of neighbouring tertiary and secondary C–H bonds for both 510 and 512, which revealed that intramolecular oxidation was preferred over intermolecular reactions.313 The reactant 510 was proposed to form spiro transition state 515, which was involved in oxidative C–H insertion at the δ position producing alcohol 516 (Scheme 111).313 The latter then undergoes intramolecular addition to give the corresponding tetrahydropyran 511.
 Scheme 110  Regioselective intramolecular δ C–H bond activation to produce tetrahydropyrans.313 
 Scheme 111  Plausible mechanism for the formation of tetra-hydropyrans.313 
The higher trans-selectivity (trans:cis = ∼4.2:1) also confirmed the presence of a spiro-transition state (STS) for concerted intramolecular secondary C–H hydroxylation of 510 (Scheme 111).313–315 Due to the STS, minimal steric repulsion is experienced when an equatorial C–H bond is oxidized to produce the trans-product, whereas a planar transition state (PTS) has higher steric requirements, and axial C–H hydroxylation yielding the cis-product is proposed to proceed through a PTS. For axial C–H hydroxylation the STS was destabilized by steric hindrance. In addition, the observed trans-selectivity in 512 for tertiary C–H oxygenation strongly supports STS 517 (vide infra) as the PTS 518 experiences high steric hindrance between the dioxirane and ε-CH2 group.

  This protocol preferred the hydroxylation of tertiary δ C–H bonds over secondary bonds, for instance, the reaction of 519 produced 520 in 73% yield with a d.r. of 4:1 (Scheme 112).315
 Scheme 112  Preferred oxygenation of tertiary δ C–H bonds over secondary bonds.315 
In 2003, Wang et al. extended this methodology further for the oxygenation of steroids (Scheme 113),315 where for 521a (n = 1) oxidation at the δ-position offered pyran product 522 with a cis junction, conversely, spirocyclic pyranose compound 523 was obtained from steroid 521b (n = 2) with retention of configuration.315

4.6.2.2. Regioselective intramolecular hydroxylation of tertiary axial C–H bonds. 
In 2009, Kasuya et al. reported a new strategy for regio- and stereo-controlled C–H bond hydroxylation producing 1,3-diaxial diols in carbocyclic moieties.316 Similar hydroxylation was observed earlier as a side reaction that produced 514 as a minor product (Scheme 110b).312 The modified procedure covalently tethered a dioxirane-precursor-containing moiety on the substrates, which could be efficiently removed after oxidative transformation. Spatial proximity accelerated oxidation in a stereospecific manner, where the axial tertiary C–H in 524 was selectively oxidized to axial tertiary alcohol 525 with retention of configuration (Scheme 114).316
 Scheme 114  Regioselective hydroxylation of a tertiary axial C–H bond.316 
4.6.2.3. Regioselective intramolecular oxidation and lactolization of phenol/anisole. 
In 2000, Yang and co-workers developed a protocol for the regioselective oxidation of phenols and anisoles 526 that yielded lactols via an intramolecular oxygenation and cyclization process (Scheme 115).184 While phenol/anisole with a C3 propylene linker produced tetrahydropyran derivative 527, a C2 ethylene linker offered tetrahydrofuran 528. The reaction also worked for substrates with tolyl (OR1 = CH3) groups. However, in this case, different regioisomers were found (Scheme 116).184

4.7. Domino reaction
A direct substitution of a nitro group for a hydroxy group using 9 was reported by Adam et al. in 1998.317 Here, the cascade (or “domino”) reaction consisted of the addition of an anion of 2-phenylpropionitrile (531) to the para-position of a nitro-substituted aromatic ring (532), followed by oxidation with aqueous 9 to obtain phenol 534 (Scheme 117).

4.8. Applications of dioxirane-mediated transformations in natural product and drug synthesis

4.8.1. Synthesis of medicinally important molecules. 
NF00659B1 (535) is a natural product isolated from Aspergillus and possesses anti-cancer properties (Scheme 118a). This diterpenoid contains an α-pyrone scaffold along with a 2,2-dimethyl oxepanol moiety.318 In 2018, Kwon and co-workers introduced a stereoselective approach to access the oxepanol core from (S)-(+)-methyl Wieland–Miescher ketone 536 (Scheme 118a). The key strategy involved a ring-closing metathesis to prepare enol ether 537, which was then subjected to epoxidation with 9 (to 538, in situ) followed by Grignard addition to access oxepanol 539 (Scheme 118b). The epoxidation and Grignard addition were executed in one pot with an overall yield of ∼62%. X-ray analysis confirmed that 539 formed as a single diastereomer.318
 Scheme 118  Application of dioxirane in the synthesis of α-pyrone diterpenoid NF00659B1.318 
Furthermore, 9-mediated stereoselective epoxidation was explored as one of the key steps, i.e., the epoxidation of enone 540 to 541, for the total synthesis of diterpenoids (±)-verrucosan-2β-ol and (±)-homoverrucosan-5β-ol (Scheme 119).319 These diterpenoids are structurally similar to sesterterpenoid (−)-variecolin, an angiotensin II receptor binding inhibitor, and can also be explored for similar applications.
 Scheme 119  Key epoxidation of enone with 9 for the synthesis of (±)-verrucosan-2β-ol and (±)-homoverrucosan-5β-ol.319 
Chiral penicillin sulfoxides are very important intermediates for the synthesis of other β-lactamase enzyme inhibitors. In 1993, Danelon et al. developed a highly diastereoselective 9-based oxidation route for the synthesis of various penicillin sulfoxides. For example, the methodology produced sulfoxide 543 quantitatively with 100% ee (Scheme 120a). The high enantioselectivity indicates an approach of 9 from the opposite phase of bulky bromo-substituents.320 Similarly, Gunda and co-workers synthesized cephalosporine sulfones 545 using 9 under neutral conditions (Scheme 120b). However, stopping the same reaction at the sulfoxide stage led to the formation of two diastereomers in ∼1:1 ratio.321

Taxol® is a well-known potent anti-cancer agent. Advanced synthetic methodologies to access it on a gram scale have been of great interest over the past two decades. In continuation of 13 years of research on Taxol® synthesis, in 2020, Baran et al. successfully developed a procedure via a two-phase strategy to access Taxol®. This protocol benefits from the superior selectivity of 9 for the epoxidation of the C5–C6 olefinic bond of 546, in comparison with other reagents (Scheme 121).322 A higher concentration of 9 (0.30 M in CHCl3) offered the best results.80 For example, oxidation with 9 in acetone (0.09 M), CH2Cl2 (0.21 M) and CHCl3 (0.30 M) gave the desired product 547 in 25, 29 and 49% isolated yield, respectively, when reactions were performed on the gram scale.322

In 2022, when the ethyl acetate extract of the rhizome of Alpinia galanga (L.) was treated with 9 (in situ), the epoxidized extract displayed higher anti-parasitic efficiency against Leishmania than the parent compound.323 Similarly, an array of chemically converted extracts were prepared using 9 (in situ) and were found to display remarkable bioactivities.


4.8.2. Selective functionalization of polyfunctional molecules. 
In 2016, Shi et al. developed a stereocontrolled synthetic route to (+)-plagiogyrin A (550), using 9 (Scheme 122).324 This is a phenol-containing natural product isolated from Plagiogyria matsumureana. The dioxirane-mediated chemoselective diazo(548)-to-aldehyde(549) conversion was very effective, with the reaction being completed within 10 min without affecting other functional groups such as acetal, alkene, aromatic ring, ester, ketone and silyl ether.324 For the synthesis of 548 to 550 involving three steps, the overall yield was 49%.
 Scheme 122  Application of dioxirane in the synthesis of (+)-plagiogyrin A.324 
In the early 2000s, 9 was used for the regioselective oxidation of polyfunctional steroid derivatives. In multi-hydroxylated steroids (551, 554 and 556), the oxidation of axial OH was preferred (Scheme 123).325 The regioselectivity and stereoselectivity observed in the oxidation reactions with 9 were different from the reactions conducted with organic peracids, tBuO2H or alkaline H2O2.325 Notably, the oxygenation process showed opposite selectivity to Baran's hydroxylation performed with 10, where equatorial-H was oxygenated (Scheme 106).302
 Scheme 123  Application of 9 in the oxidation of a polyfunctional steroid.325 
In 1995, Denmark et al. showed the stereoselective 258-catalyzed oxidation of steroid 558 bearing a vinyl ether to α-hydroxy ketone 559 in 81% yield (Scheme 124).217
 Scheme 124  Application of dioxirane in the selective oxidation of steroids.217 
The chemo-/regio-/stereoselective epoxidation of olefins by 9 is key to isolating exo-epoxide 561, a metabolite of aflatoxin B1 (560),326 a compound with carcinogenic properties. Epoxide 561 was labile and reacted with guanine moieties of human DNA, accounting for the carcinogenicity of aflatoxin B1. The synthesis of 561 could not be achieved through common epoxidation methods, namely peroxyacids327 and halohydrin intermediates.328 Conversely, the reaction of 560 with 9 produced 561 within 15 min at rt (Scheme 125).326 Thus, dioxirane 9 was a very efficient reagent for exocyclic epoxidation.

α-Thujone is a monoterpene neurotoxin. In 2016, Thamm et al. found 10 as the reagent of choice for the selective synthesis of the 7-hydroxylated metabolite of α-thujone 563 (Scheme 126).329
 Scheme 126  Dioxirane 10 mediated synthesis of α-thujone.329 
In 2021, Shin and co-workers reported the industrial-scale synthesis of eldecalcitol (567), a vitamin D3-analog used in the treatment of osteoporosis.330 The 23-step synthesis with an overall yield of 0.42% involved dioxirane-mediated C–H oxidation. Vitamin D3 (564) was converted into Grundman's ketone 565via ozonolysis, then treatment with in situ generated 10 selectively hydroxylated a tertiary C–H bond to give alcohol 566 (Scheme 127). The alcohol is further converted into 567 through a multi-step reaction.330

In 2000, Williams and Brugel synthesized α,β-unsaturated enone 571 from corresponding trans-decalin 570via9-mediated oxidative Nef reaction (Scheme 128).250,331 This protocol was useful in synthesizing the A and B rings of the marine alkaloid norzoanthamine.

Huang and co-workers employed dioxirane 9 in a key step during the syntheses of (−)-isochaetominines A–C and four pairs of enantiomers of the C-derivative.332,333 The total syntheses were unprecedented enantioselective and stereodivergent methods to access these alkaloids. The 9-mediated reaction was stereodivergent. Although functional groups like imine, ester and amide were present in the intermediate, the unprotected indole underwent epoxidation resulting in a mixture of two products; these are key intermediates for the synthesis of the respective alkaloids. The same group further extended this methodology to access (−)-versiquinazoline H enantioselectively.334
In 2020, Aitken et al.335 reported a catalytic asymmetric ene-coupling reaction between silyl enol ethers and glyoxal as a direct method to prepare α-hydroxy-1,4-diketone, a key intermediate to synthesize various natural products. The synthesis of 569 involved the 9-mediated oxidation of α-diazo ketone 568 (Scheme 129).335

4.8.3. Synthesis of biomolecule precursors. 
Dioxirane oxidizes amino sugars (572 or 574) into corresponding hydroxylamine 573 or oxime 575 depending on the structural features (Scheme 130).336 No further oxidation of 573 was observed with 9, where the amino group was equatorially placed (Scheme 130a). However, for an axially oriented amino group, reaction with 9 gave oxime 575 (Scheme 130b).336 For the latter case, the reaction was incomplete and a mixture of starting material 574 and oxime 575 was obtained.250,336

In 1995, Yang et al. reported the 10 (in situ) mediated epoxidation of 3,4,6-tri-O-pivaloyl-D-glucal (576), which upon methanolysis produced tri-O-pivaloyl-D-glucopyranoside (577 and 578) in 84% overall yield (Scheme 131).53,216 The reaction offered both α- and β-epoxides in a 3:1 ratio, respectively.

Dioxirane 9-mediated oxidation of 9H-purine-6-thiol 579 in the presence of an amine nucleophile offered adenosine 580 (Scheme 132). The transformation indeed illustrated the higher reactivity of the –SH group towards 9-based oxidation compared to the –NH2 group.337
 Scheme 132  Application of dioxirane in the synthesis of ribonucleoside.250,337,338 
In 2001, Detomaso and Curci showed another application of 10 that involved the oxidation of Boc-protected amino esters 581. Here N–H oxidation product 582 was preferentially formed over C–H oxidation (Scheme 133).339 Deprotection of the Boc-group in the next step produced the N-hydroxy amino acid ester, an important intermediate in the metabolic pathway.339
 Scheme 133  Selective synthesis of an N-hydroxy amino acid ester.339 
Annese et al. investigated selectivity in the dioxirane-mediated N–H oxygenation of peptides.142 In the presence of 10, the oxidation of tripeptides 583 occurred selectively without affecting the chiral centers. Furthermore, when the N-terminus protecting groups were Ac, Tf or Piv (583b–d), oxidation of the side-chain was preferred resulting in the formation of 585b–d in 62–68% yield (Scheme 134).
 Scheme 134  Selective synthesis of an N-hydroxy amino acid ester.142,339 
However, N-terminal hydroxylation was preferred for the carbamate type N-protecting group of tripeptide 583a forming 584a and 586a.142
Dioxiranes were also explored for the selective oxidative transformations of peptides, where corresponding C–H oxidation over N–H oxidation offered hydroxy-peptides. Valinomycin (587) is a macrocyclic peptide. When treated with 10, corresponding hydroxy peptides 588, 589 and 590 were formed in 45.5, 26 and 28.5% yield, respectively (Scheme 135).143 Such hydroxy-tethered macrocyclic peptides find applications in biological recognition, ion transport, catalysis, etc.340,341

In 1990, Paradkar et al. demonstrated in situ generated 9-mediated oxidative decarboxylation of α-amino acids 591 (Scheme 136a).342 The oxidative decarboxylation was proposed to proceed via hydroxylamine 593, nitroso 594 and oxime 595 intermediates (Scheme 136b). Among these intermediates, 593 and 595 were isolated and characterized. Using the protocol, desaminoarginine could be obtained from homo arginine in 56% yield.342
 Scheme 136  Dioxirane-mediated oxidative decarboxylation of α-amino acids.342 
In 1992, direct C–H bond insertion using 9 was explored by the Marples and Ferrer groups for the oxidative cleavage of benzyl ethers.343,344 Then, Csuk and Petra successfully deprotected O-benzyl of carbohydrate 597 to alcohol 598 using 9 in 93% yield (Scheme 137).345 Similarly, in 2011, the Niemietz group successfully deprotected the O-Bn group in the presence of multiple O-acetyl groups.93 Thus, 9-mediated benzyl deprotection is very effective for pursuing the functionalization of carbohydrates involving protection–deprotection chemistry.

5. Miscellaneous applications
5.1. Bleaching and disinfection
Dioxiranes are safer, cheaper, and more effective alternatives to chlorine-based reagents346,347 for several applications such as disinfection and bleaching. Non-chlorinated bleaching agents such as O2 and H2O2 can increase the overall cost of the bleaching process. This indicates the need for a safe, efficient, and inexpensive bleaching agent. In addition to that, chemicals used in the pulp bleaching process can affect the brightness of the resulting papers.348
An industrial bleaching process consisting of the treatment of wood pulp with dioxiranes at 5–50 °C for 90 min was discovered in the early 1990s.349 The process was found to be superior and more environmentally friendly than chlorine-based bleaching methods. A few years later, another process for bleaching fabrics350 was developed using dioxiranes as dry concentrates or solutions in both aqueous and non-aqueous medium. The process was found to be environmentally safe and effective even below room temperature.

In situ generated dioxiranes were used as decontaminants in a bicarbonate-buffered formulation for rapid neutralization of lethal chemical and biological warfare agents. A 7-log (i.e., 99.99999%) concentration of dioxirane kills off certain bacteria and viruses as opposed to 40% for bicarbonate-buffered Oxone® in the absence of ketones.351 A cleaning composition made of dioxirane to disinfect dental prostheses was reported.352 The applications of 9 are not limited to bleaching and disinfection but also extend to degradation dyes like Congo red and nigrosine dye;353 the separation and degradation of dyes is necessary as they pose challenges to the eco-system.354,355
5.2. Functionalization of single walled carbon nanotubes
Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are unique systems that are useful for applications in drug delivery. For example, when paramagnetic metal ions are filled inside the drug-loaded CNT bucket, drug delivery can be achieved in a controlled fashion with the help of an external magnetic field.356 Thus, the oxidation of SWCNTs provides new functionalities for drug delivery applications. Oxidation requires mild conditions, as strong acids can disturb the graphitic structure.357 In 2018, D'Accolti et al. generated 10in situ to functionalize SWCNTs 599 at 25 °C. The mild reaction conditions enabled epoxidation to 600 without creating any defects or holes (Scheme 138).20
 Scheme 138  Application of 10 for the epoxidation of a SWCNT.20 
5.3. Oxygenation of metal–organic frameworks
Post-synthetic modification (PSM) is a versatile synthetic strategy that enables the incorporation of desired functionalities into a material post-synthetically. PSM of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) was pioneered by Wang and Cohen in 2007.358 Epoxides are 1,2-synthons and important intermediates that exhibit both ring-opening and expansion. In 2012, Hindelang et al. functionalized a Zn-MOF with epoxy groups by PSM.359 It involved the 9-mediated epoxidation of olefin-tagged linker 601 to epoxide 602, followed by the addition of thiol 604 to obtain MOF 603 with ethyl mercaptan in 50% yield (Scheme 139).359

6. Conclusions and future perspectives
The broad scope of dioxirane applications is immensely useful in synthetic organic chemistry. Oxidations, epoxidations, C–H hydroxylation, etc. are achieved efficiently under mild reaction conditions. In addition, the applications of dioxiranes for various asymmetric transformations are of paramount importance. Dioxiranes were used as oxidants in key steps for the synthesis of various natural products, drugs and bio-molecules. The mechanistic insights into dioxirane-mediated reactions are well explored, which helps in establishing new reaction protocols. The mild reaction conditions permit post-synthetic modifications of complex systems such as MOFs and the functionalization of single-walled carbon nanotubes without disturbing their morphologies. Thus, dioxiranes have a demonstrated utility as well as untapped potential.
Although a variety of dioxirane pre-catalysts/catalysts were developed that exhibited remarkable outputs, still there are some improvements needed. These are listed below.
(1) A BVO-free protocol is yet to be established. The stability of dioxiranes is relatively poor. Thus, new modified dioxiranes are still needed.
(2) Polymer-supported dioxirane catalysts are already reported for heterogeneous reactions. Continuing research is focused on the development of heterogeneous catalysts with excellent porosity. Such materials can be porous organic materials (POP), metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), etc. Dioxiranes on such porous polymeric scaffolds can give higher efficiencies and turnover numbers (TONs). Furthermore, such advanced materials can offer superior reactivity with a high turnover frequency (TOF).
(3) Dioxirane-appended chiral polymeric materials will make an excellent contribution; it is expected that the rigid and chiral nano-pockets will provide impressive stereo-selectivity and reactivity.
(4) Thermal studies like boiling point, flash point, melting point, etc. are estimated using theoretical calculations. Experimental data will be practical and hence will be more useful.
