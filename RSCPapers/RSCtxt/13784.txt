    , Accepted 23rd December 2011First published on 23rd December 2011AbstractHere we report that photostability and photoactivity of WO3 for water oxidation can be simultaneously enhanced by controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies into WO3 in hydrogen atmosphere at elevated temperatures. In comparison to pristine WO3, the hydrogen-treated WO3 nanoflakes show an order of magnitude enhanced photocurrent, and more importantly, exhibit extraordinary stability for water oxidation without loss of photoactivity for at least seven hours. The enhanced photostability is attributed to the formation of substoichiometric WO3−x after hydrogen treatment, which is highly resistive to the re-oxidation and peroxo-species induced dissolution. This work constitutes the first example where WO3 can be stabilized for water oxidation in neutral medium without the need for oxygen evolution catalysts. The demonstration of electrochemically stable WO3 could open up new opportunities for WO3 based photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic applications.

Broader context
Photoelectrochemical water splitting using semiconductor photoelectrodes is a promising and environmentally friendly method to produce solar hydrogen. WO3 as a photoanode material has attracted extensive attention due to its favorable bandgap. However, photoelectrochemical instability is a major hurdle for the WO3 photoanode, as the peroxo-species generated in water oxidation cause photocorrosion of WO3. An effective approach to stabilize WO3 is to deposit a layer of oxygen evolution catalyst to reduce oxygen evolution overpotential and therefore suppress the formation of peroxo species. However, a thick catalyst layer will sacrifice the photoactivity of WO3 by blocking the light penetration. In this work, we demonstrated that stability and photoactivity of WO3 for water oxidation can be simultaneously enhanced by controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies via thermal treatment in hydrogen atmosphere. In comparison to pristine WO3, the hydrogen-treated WO3 show an order of magnitude enhanced photocurrent, and more importantly, they are stable for water oxidation. The improved stability is attributed to the formation of substoichiometric WO3−x, which is highly resistive to the re-oxidation and peroxo-species induced dissolution. This work constitutes the first example where WO3 can be stabilized for water oxidation without the need for oxygen evolution catalysts.

Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting using semiconductor photoelectrodes is a promising and environmentally friendly method to produce solar hydrogen.1–11 Among semiconductors, WO3 has attracted extensive attention due to its relatively small bandgap (Eg = 2.6 eV), which could theoretically utilize ∼12% solar light.12–18 For example, Su et al. recently reported a solvothermal method for fabricating WO3 nanowire and nanoflake arrays, and their implementation as photoanodes for PEC water oxidation. They found that material morphology plays an important role in determining PEC performance of WO3.18 Moreover, Liu et al. demonstrated a novel WO3/TiSi2 nanonet structure for PEC water splitting. This core–shell nanostructure reduced the diffusion length for minority carriers and achieved a maximum photo-conversion efficiency of 1.1% at 0.8 V vs. RHE.16 Despite the significant progress in improving the photoactivity of WO3, it is known to be thermodynamically unstable in electrolyte solution with pH > 4 due to OH− induced chemical dissolution (WO3(s) + OH−1 → WO2−4(aq) + H+).19,20 Additionally, photocorrosion of WO3 was observed in neutral pH solution and even in acidic solution,16,17,21–23 induced by the peroxo-species, intermediates created during water oxidation.24 Although the formation of peroxo-species (Eo = 1.78 V) is energetically less favorable than photo-oxidation of water to O2 (Eo = 1.23 V), it is kinetically competitive with water oxidation that needs to overcome a large overpotential.23 Therefore, the instability has been one of the major hurdles for the application of WO3 in PEC water oxidation.
In spite of the importance of the stability issues, most research efforts have been focused on increasing the photoactivity of WO3, for example, through material structural design,17,18 doping,21,25 and plasmonic effect.15 The stabilization of WO3 photoanodes for water oxidation is rarely studied. Recently, Liu et al. and Seabold et al. reported an effective approach to stabilize WO3 by coating a layer of oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) such as manganese and cobalt based catalysts on WO3.16,23,26,27 The OECs were used to reduce the oxygen evolution overpotential and therefore suppress the formation of peroxo species. It has been reported that a thin layer OEC coating can stabilize the photoactivity of WO3 for several hours16 and a heavy coating can extend its stability to 12 hours.23 However, a thick OEC layer also blocks light penetration, and decreases the photoactivity of WO3.23 It is highly desirable to improve the stability of the WO3 photoanode without sacrificing photoactivity.
Recently, we demonstrated that photoactivity of hydrogen-treated TiO2 nanowires can be enhanced as a result of increased donor density by introducing a moderate amount of oxygen vacancies.28 A similar effect is expected to be observed in hydrogen-treated WO3. More importantly, it has been reported that substoichiometric WO3−x, formed by creating oxygen vacancies (W5+) in WO3, is thermodynamically stable at room temperature, and can only be re-oxidized in air at a temperature higher than 400 °C.29 For instance, substoichiometric WO3−x has been used as a passive layer to protect tungsten metal from further dissolution in chemical mechanical polishing, indicating WO3−x is resistive to the peroxo-species induced dissolution.30 Therefore, we hypothesized that hydrogen treatment can create substoichiometric WO3−x, which could simultaneously improve the photoactivity and stability of WO3 for water oxidation. In this work, we demonstrate that substoichiometric WO3−x were prepared by controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies (reducing W6+ to W5+) in hydrogen atmosphere at elevated temperatures. In comparison to pristine WO3, hydrogen-treated WO3−x showed an order of magnitude enhanced photocurrent density and extraordinary stability without significant loss of photoactivity for at least seven hours.
Experimental section
Materials
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO, TEC 8) glass substrates were purchased from Hartford Glass Company Inc. WCl6 (99.9%), HCl (36.5%–38%), Na2WO4·2H2O and H2O2 (30%) were purchased from Fisher Scientific Company.
Preparation of WO3 nanoflakes
WO3 nanoflakes were grown on a FTO glass substrate using a seed mediated solvothermal method. The WO3 seed solution was prepared as follows. 0.5 mmol WCl6 was dissolved in 20 ml ethanol solution. The dissolved WCl6 was quickly hydrolyzed by water moisture and produced blue precipitates. 30% H2O2 solution was added to the blue precipitate-containing solution with stirring until it became a clear solution. This solution was dropped onto a piece of clean FTO glass. The excess solution was blown away by compressed air after 30 s. The FTO substrate was then annealed at 350 °C on a hotplate in air for 10 min. This deposition–annealing process was repeated for two or three times to get a uniform WO3 seed layer on the FTO substrate. The W precursor solution was prepared as follows. 1.03 g Na2WO4 was dissolved in 25 ml deionized water and mixed with 1 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid. The yellow precipitates produced in the reaction were re-dissolved by adding 0.3 ml of 30% H2O2. This W precursor solution was boiled for five minutes to remove excess H2O2. The seeded FTO substrate was placed into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (30 ml volume) with the seeded side facing down. 3 ml W precursor solution and 20 ml ethanol were transferred into the autoclave. The sealed autoclave was heated in an electric oven at 180 °C for 5 hours, and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. The FTO substrate was coated with a uniform blue film. After being washed with ethanol and water, the film was calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 hours.
Hydrogen treatment
Hydrogen treatment was carried out in a home built tube furnace system. The calcined WO3 nanoflake films were further annealed in hydrogen (1 bar, 50 sccm H2 flow) at different temperatures in the range of 250–500 °C for 20 minutes.
Material characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected with a field-emission SEM (Hitachi S-4800II). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected in a FEI Monochromated F20 UT Technai TEM/STEM operated at 200 kV. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were collected with a Rigaku Americas Miniflex Plus powder diffractometer. Diffraction spectra were recorded from a 2θ angle of 20 to 70° with a step size of 0.04° at a rate of 1° min−1. Raman spectroscopy measurements were carried out on a Nicolet Almega XR Dispersive Raman spectrometer (laser wavelength 780 nm). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (Perkin-Elmer) using Mg-monochromatic X-ray at a power of 25 W with an X-ray-beam diameter of 10 mm, and a pass energy of 29.35 eV. The pressure of the analyzer chamber was maintained below 5 × 10−8 Pa during the measurement. The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1s photoelectron peak at 284.6 eV as reference.
Photoelectrochemical measurement
WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 samples were fashioned into photoanodes by soldering a copper wire onto a bare part of the FTO substrate. The substrate edges and the metal contact region were sealed with insulating epoxy resin. The working electrode area is in the range of 0.2–0.25 cm2. 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 6.8) was used as electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammograms and I–t scans were collected on a CHI 660D electrochemical station, with Ag/AgCl as reference and Pt wire as counter electrode, under simulated sunlight generated with a 150 W xenon lamp (Newport 6255) coupled with an AM 1.5 global filter (Newport 81094). All linear sweep voltammograms were collected at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was collected by a CHI 660D with a solar simulator (Newport 69920, 1000 W xenon lamp), coupled with an infrared water filter (Oriel 6127) and an aligned monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone 130 1/8 m). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out using a CHI 660D electrochemical station with 5 mV perturbation and a frequency range from 100000 to 1 Hz at different potentials. Mott–Schottky plots were generated from capacitance obtained from the EIS spectra at each potential with a frequency of 10000 Hz.
Electrochromism studies
Electrochromism studies were carried out in a 1.0 M H2SO4 solution on a three-electrode system with Ag/AgCl as reference, Pt wire as counter electrode and WO3 film as working electrode. The HxWO3 electrode was prepared by applying a negative bias of 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl on WO3 in 1.0 M H2SO4 solution for 3 s. The PEC performance of the HxWO3 electrode was investigated in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of hydrogen-treated WO3
WO3 nanoflake films were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, using a seed mediated solvothermal method (Experimental section). The uniform WO3 films are covered by submicron-sized nanoflake bundles with a typical length of 4–5 μm (Fig. 1a). Each bundle is composed of a stack of thin nanoflakes. TEM images recorded from representative WO3 nanoflake bundles showed that these nanoflakes are single crystals (inset, Fig. 1b) with a smooth surface (Fig. 1b).
 Fig. 1  (a) SEM image of WO3 nanoflakes (scale bar: 10 μm); inset: magnified SEM image of nanoflake bundles (scale bar: 1 μm). (b) TEM images of WO3 nanoflakes (scale bar: 100 nm); inset: lattice-resolved TEM image collected at the edge of the nanoflake (scale bar: 5 nm). 
The as-prepared nanoflakes were first calcined in air at 500 °C for 2 h, followed by high temperature annealing (250–500 °C) in hydrogen atmosphere for another 20 minutes to create oxygen vacancies in WO3. As shown in Fig. 2a (inset), the pristine WO3 film is yellow in color. As the hydrogen annealing temperature increases, the film color changes from green (350 °C) to deep green (400 °C) and eventually to dark blue when the temperature is 450 °C or above. Fig. 2a shows the UV-visible diffusive reflectance spectra of WO3 and H-treated WO3 samples prepared at 350, 400 and 450 °C. All the samples show fairly low reflectance in the UV and blue region (<400 nm). The reflectance increases and peaks at around 480 nm, which is consistent with the indirect bandgap absorption edge of WO3 (2.6 eV). The low reflectance in the red region is due to low scattering and lack of absorption, while the low reflectance in the UV region is mostly due to absorption of the sample, which dominates over scattering. WO3 samples absorb most of the UV-blue light and therefore appear yellow in color. For the hydrogen-treated samples, the reflectance in the wavelength above 480 nm decreases significantly (absorb more orange and red light) as the temperature increases, which is in agreement with the color changes from yellow to blue. The color change suggests possible modification in crystal structure and/or phase change during hydrogen treatment. XRD spectra collected from pristine WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 samples prepared at 350 and 500 °C (Fig. 2b) confirmed this hypothesis. After subtracting the diffraction peaks originating from the FTO substrate, the peaks collected from pristine WO3 can be indexed as monoclinic WO3 (PCPDF #: 72-1465). There is no obvious shift in the diffraction peaks between pristine WO3 and the hydrogen-treated WO3 samples at 350 °C. However, these monoclinic WO3 diffraction peaks gradually disappear accompanied with the emergence of new peaks in the samples hydrogen treated at the temperature of 500 °C. These new peaks can be indexed as monoclinic WO2.9 (PCPDF #: 05-0386) and small amount of monoclinic WO2.92 (PCPDF #: 30-1387) highlighted by * and + in Fig. 2b, indicating the successful reduction of WO3. Diffraction peaks corresponding to Sn metal are also identified as a result of the reduction of the FTO substrate. Furthermore, Raman analysis also confirms the conversion of monoclinic WO3 to WO2.9 during hydrogen treatment (Fig. 2c). The characteristic Raman peaks for WO3 become broader as the annealing temperature increases, suggesting gradual degradation of WO3 crystallinity, which is expected for the increased amount of oxygen vacancies. For the WO3 sample hydrogen-treated at 500 °C, all the Raman peaks of WO3 disappeared, and left a broad peak in the region of 700–1000 cm−1, which is consistent with the reported Raman spectrum of WO2.9.31 Additionally, the formation of W5+ allows the intervalence charge transfer between W5+ to W6+ in the substoichiometric WO3−x,32 which explains the observed color change gradually from yellow (WO3) to deep blue (WO2.9 and WO2.92). Taken together, these results support the successful introduction of oxygen vacancies into monoclinic WO3 by hydrogen treatment, and the amount of oxygen vacancies can be controlled by the annealing temperature.

Photoactivity and photostability studies
The PEC properties of pristine WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 samples were measured in a three-electrode electrochemical cell (using Ag/AgCl in sat. KCl as reference electrode and Pt wire as counter electrode) with 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution as electrolyte (Experimental section). Fig. 3a compares the linear sweep voltammograms collected for pristine WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 samples at temperatures of 350, 400 and 450 °C. The photocurrent density of pristine WO3 sample is 0.1 mA cm−1−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is comparable to the value obtained for the WO3 nanowire photoanode reported previously.18 The photocurrent densities of WO3 increase gradually with the increase of hydrogen treatment temperature from 250 to 350 °C (Fig. 3b). The WO3 sample hydrogen treated at 350 °C achieved a maximum value of 0.88 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is about an order of magnitude enhancement compared to pristine WO3 at the same potential. The enhancement is believed to be due to the increased amount of oxygen vacancies that serve as shallow electron donor for WO3.33 It confirms our hypothesis that hydrogen treatment could improve the photoactivity of WO3. Photocurrent densities decrease gradually with increasing temperature when the annealing temperature is 400 °C or above. There are two possible explanations. First, WO3 transforms into WO2.9 during hydrogen treatment (as confirmed by XRD and Raman results), and WO2.9 is known to be photoelectrochemically inactive for water oxidation.34 Second, the resistance of the FTO substrate increased from 13 to 760 Ω as a result of degradation of the FTO layer (Sn metal formation as confirmed by XRD results), which increases the voltage drop at the interface of WO3 and the substrate.
 Fig. 3  Measured PEC properties for WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 samples. (a) Representative I–V curves measured under 100 mW cm−2 simulated solar light generated by a 100 W xenon lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter. (b) Photocurrent densities and photocurrent density retention measured at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for the first 6 minutes of irradiation as a function of hydrogen annealing temperatures. (c) I–t curves collected at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl; insets: I–t curves for the first 200 seconds of irradiation. 
To investigate the stability of pristine WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 for water oxidation, we define a parameter of photocurrent density retention in the first six minutes of irradiation as Iinital/Ifinal, where Iinitial and Ifinal are the photocurrent densities at time = 0 and 6 min, respectively. All the samples for the stability investigation are freshly prepared. As shown in Fig. 3b, photocurrent density retention for pristine WO3 is only about 30%, which is comparable to the reported values for WO3 nanostructures.16,22,23 Significantly, the retention values of hydrogen-treated WO3 samples increase substantially with annealing temperature, achieving excellent photocurrent density retention more than 80% for those samples annealed at 350 °C or above. Furthermore, we investigated the long-term stability of these samples (Fig. 3c). The photocurrent density of WO3 drops about 65% within the first two minutes, and then decreases slowly (Fig. 3c, inset). After a two-hour illumination, 80% of the photoactivity of WO3 was lost. In contrast, the photocurrent density for the hydrogen-treated WO3 sample prepared at 350 °C drops 17% within the first 2 minutes, and then achieves a stable photocurrent without decay under the irradiation for at least seven hours (Fig. 3c). That the photocurrent increases slightly with time could be due to self-activation and increasing trap filling of the WO3−x sample.3,35 These I–t data are direct evidence supporting our hypothesis that hydrogen treatment can stabilize the photoactivity of WO3 for water oxidation. The superior stability of hydrogen-treated WO3 for water oxidation is believed to be due to the formation of partially reduced substoichiometric WO3−x, which has been reported to be thermodynamically stable at room temperature towards re-oxidation and highly resistive to peroxide species induced dissolution.30
The color changes of WO3 during hydrogen treatment suggest a modification in the light absorption profile. In order to quantitatively investigate the relation between the photoactivity and the light absorption, we measured their photoactivity as a function of the wavelength of incident light. Fig. 4 shows the IPCE data collected from WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 samples with green (350 °C), blue (400 °C) and deep blue (450 °C) colors. IPCE can be expressed by the equation:IPCE = (1240 × I)/(λ × Jlight),where I is the measured photocurrent density at a specific wavelength, λ is the wavelength of incident light, and Jlight is the measured irradiance at a specific wavelength. In comparison to pristine WO3, all hydrogen-treated WO3 samples exhibit enhanced IPCE in the entire absorption region (300–480 nm). They show similar absorption edges at around ∼480 nm, which is consistent with the WO3 bandgap of 2.6 eV.18 We did not observe any photoactivity in the visible light region beyond 480 nm, indicating that the observed color change is not due to the bandgap engineering of WO3 or the transition between the impurity states and conduction/valence band edges. Therefore, the color changes could be due to intervalence charge transition from W6+ to W5+, which have previously been reported.29,36

Formation of substoichiometric WO3−x
To further elucidate the effect of hydrogen treatment on the chemical states of WO3 and how it interplays with their photoactivity, we measured the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of pristine WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 samples prepared at temperatures of 350 °C and 450 °C. XPS survey spectra collected from WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 samples confirm the presence of W and O as well as a small amount of C, while no other impurities' signal was found in the samples (Fig. S1a, ESI†). Carbon is believed to be included during sample preparation (in air) and subsequent handling. As shown in the normalized high resolution W 4f spectra (Fig. 5a and b), they all have a broad peak, corresponding to the characteristic W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2 peaks for WO3.37,38 The XPS W4f of pristine WO3 can be deconvoluted into one pair of peaks, corresponding to the typical binding energies of W6+ oxidation states (centered at 37.7 and 35.5 eV) (Fig. S1b, ESI†). Note that the W 4f peaks of hydrogen-treated samples are slightly broader than that of pristine WO3, with a shoulder at the lower binding energy region (Fig. 5a). The peak can be deconvoluted into two pairs of peaks, corresponding to the typical binding energies of two W oxidation states, W6+ (centered at 37.7 and 35.5 eV) and W5+ (centered at 37.0 and 34.3 eV) respectively (Fig. 5b).37,38 The data suggest the presence of W5+ (oxygen vacancies) in the hydrogen-treated WO3 samples, in agreement with the Raman and XRD results. The amount of W5+ is estimated to be 4% in the H-treated WO3 sample prepared at 350 °C, and it increased to 20% in the sample prepared at 450 °C. The results support that the W5+ increased with the increase of annealing temperature. It is known that the substoichiometric WO3−x is favorable to form shear defects. The normalized XPS O1s spectra collected from WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3−x samples are similar (Fig. 5c), indicating that these plane defects do not significantly affect the coordination polyhedron of oxygen about each W.39,40 In addition, the absence of the hydroxyl (O–H) peak or broader shoulder that is expected to be observed at around 532 eV indicates that the hydrogen treatment did not lead to the formation of tungsten bronze HxWO3, which is also blue in color.41 HxWO3 is well known for its electrochromism, as it can be easily bleached by applying a positive bias. To differentiate WO3−x from HxWO3, we studied the PEC water oxidation stability of the hydrogen-treated WO3 and HxWO3 control samples. HxWO3 was electrochemically prepared on pristine WO3 (Experimental section).42 We compared the performance of HxWO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 for water oxidation at a bias of 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. As shown in Fig. 6, HxWO3 was quickly bleached due to its electrochromatic property within 3 minutes either in the dark or under illumination, as expected. In contrast, there is no obvious change in color and photoactivity for the hydrogen-treated WO3 sample measured at the same potential under light illumination for 3 hours. This proves that the hydrogen-treated samples are not HxWO3 and they are stable and resistive to electrochemical oxidation. Finally, the XPS valence band spectra collected from WO3 and WO3−x samples are similar and an estimate of the valence band maximum by linear extrapolation to the baseline derives a band edge position of ∼2.0 eV below the Fermi energy in both cases (Fig. 5d). The fact that all the films exhibit almost the same position of the valence band maximum indicates a negligible effect of hydrogen treatment on the valence band position at the surface of WO3.

Electrochemical studies
To investigate the effect of hydrogen treatment on the electronic properties of WO3, we measured electrochemical impedance for pristine WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 samples. Capacitances were derived from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) obtained at each potential with 10 kHz frequency in the dark. Fig. 7 shows the Mott–Schottky plots generated from the capacitance values. All samples show positive slopes in the Mott–Schottky plots, as expected for n-type semiconductors. The hydrogen-treated WO3 samples show substantially smaller slopes compared to the WO3 sample, suggesting significantly increased donor densities based on the Mott–Schottky equation,Nd = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1,where e0 is the electron charge, ε the dielectric constant of WO3 (ε = 20), ε0 the permittivity of vacuum, Nd the donor density, and V the applied bias at the electrode. The donor densities of WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 prepared at 350 °C are calculated to be 1.0 × 1019 and 5.0 × 1022 cm−3, respectively. Although the Mott–Schottky equation is derived based on the planar structure and it may not be able to determine precisely the donor density of nanostructured materials, it is reasonable to qualitatively compare the changes of donor density between WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 samples as they have similar morphology. The enhanced donor density is attributed to the introduction of oxygen vacancies, which serve as shallow electron donor,33 and therefore improves the charge transport in WO3−x and at the interface between FTO and WO3−x.28,43,44 Furthermore, the capacitance of pristine WO3 reaches a plateau at around 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which suggests that the depletion layer does not increase with further increase of applied potential.45 It explains the photocurrent density saturation of WO3 at around 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Fig. 3a). Meanwhile, we did not observe photocurrent density saturation for hydrogen-treated WO3 in the potential range we studied which is consistent with its linear Mott–Schottky plot. Furthermore, there is a negative shift of flat band potential in hydrogen-treated samples. It could be due to the substantially increased donor density that shifts the Fermi level of WO3 upward. Additionally, the contribution of Helmholtz layer capacitance becomes significant when there is a three orders of magnitude increase in the donor density of WO3, which will cause a negative shift of the flat band potential (x-intercept) in the Mott–Schottky plot as well.46 We also measured the Mott–Schottky plots for WO3 and hydrogen-treated WO3 samples with applied frequencies of 1 kHz, 4 kHz, and 7 kHz (data not shown). As expected, the slopes of Mott–Schottky plots of these samples increase with the increase of applied frequency, because the dielectric constant is frequency dependent.

Conclusion
In summary, hydrogen treatment represents a novel method to simultaneously activate and stabilize the photoactivity of WO3 nanoflakes for PEC water oxidation. By annealing pristine WO3 in hydrogen atmosphere at different temperatures, they can be partially reduced to substoichiometric WO3−x. These hydrogen-treated WO3 samples showed an order of magnitude enhancement in photocurrent density compared to pristine WO3, as a result of three orders of magnitude increased donor density of WO3 by introduction of oxygen vacancies. More importantly, we demonstrated, for the first time, that the hydrogen-treated WO3 photoanodes (without coating of OEC) exhibit outstanding stability for water oxidation, without significant loss of photoactivity for seven hours. The enhanced photostability is attributed to the formation of substoichiometric WO3−x after hydrogen treatment, which is highly resistive to the re-oxidation and peroxo-species induced dissolution. The capability of producing photoactive and electrochemically stable WO3 could open up new opportunities for WO3-based photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic applications.

Broader context
Photoelectrochemical water splitting using semiconductor photoelectrodes is a promising and environmentally friendly method to produce solar hydrogen. WO3 as a photoanode material has attracted extensive attention due to its favorable bandgap. However, photoelectrochemical instability is a major hurdle for the WO3 photoanode, as the peroxo-species generated in water oxidation cause photocorrosion of WO3. An effective approach to stabilize WO3 is to deposit a layer of oxygen evolution catalyst to reduce oxygen evolution overpotential and therefore suppress the formation of peroxo species. However, a thick catalyst layer will sacrifice the photoactivity of WO3 by blocking the light penetration. In this work, we demonstrated that stability and photoactivity of WO3 for water oxidation can be simultaneously enhanced by controlled introduction of oxygen vacancies via thermal treatment in hydrogen atmosphere. In comparison to pristine WO3, the hydrogen-treated WO3 show an order of magnitude enhanced photocurrent, and more importantly, they are stable for water oxidation. The improved stability is attributed to the formation of substoichiometric WO3−x, which is highly resistive to the re-oxidation and peroxo-species induced dissolution. This work constitutes the first example where WO3 can be stabilized for water oxidation without the need for oxygen evolution catalysts.
