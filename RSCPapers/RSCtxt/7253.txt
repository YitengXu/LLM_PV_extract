Hollow structured TiO2 with high surface area, low density and high loading capacity has been used to improve the photoconversion efficiency in solar cells and water splitting.1–4 To date, the hollow TiO2 spheres have been sized in a micron range with limited efficiency enhancement. In addition, they are mainly fabricated by a templating approach or/and a surfactant-assisted (known as the soft-templating method) complicated preparation process at high cost.5–8 Due to the fast hydrolysis of titanium salts and the insolubility of TiO2, it is still a great challenge to directly fabricate a size-tailored hollow structure from titanium salts or dense TiO2 nanoparticles without using a template or surfactant.9–12 Herein we report unique submicron hollow TiO2 spheres, which are synthesized through a direct self-assembly process from TiO2 nanoparticles without any template or surfactant. Furthermore, compared with the reported micrometer-sized hollow materials,13,14 our prepared submicron hollow TiO2 spheres have a better visible light-matching size as a scattering layer to boost the power conversion efficiency for a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC).
The submicrometer-sized hollow structured TiO2 spheres were fabricated by the one-pot hydrothermal method as illustrated in Fig. 1 (Experimental details seen in ESI†). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 2) strongly evidence that the hollow TiO2 spheres are self-assembled from the torispherical commercial TiO2 particles through the Ostwald ripening process.15,16Fig. 2a and b illustrate that the outward of dense TiO2 spheres are digested to unconsolidated nanoparticles in step 1. With the mass transport from the center to outward, the nanoparticles are self-assembled into a hollow structure gradually in step 2 as shown in Fig. 2c. After 48 h reaction, hollow spheres with a thickness of 50–80 nm, which are composed of 10–15 nm nanoparticles, are finally formed (Fig. 2d and e). The outer diameters of these hollow spheres are sharply around 500 nm (Fig. 2d), matching well with the visible wavelength range. In comparison with micrometer-sized scattering materials, these sized hollow particles should harvest the visible light much better for a higher scattering efficiency according to the Mie theory.17

The crystalline phase and size of the hollow structured particles were further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra and a laser particle analyzer (Fig. S1, ESI†), showing that XRD patterns of both commercial TiO2 and hollow TiO2 have the diffraction peaks perfectly indexed to an anatase TiO2 (JCPDS No.21-1272). Based on the Scherrer formula, the nanoparticles assembled hollow spheres calculated from the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of XRD peaks have a size of ∼13 nm, which is in good agreement with the observation in the TEM image (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, the size distribution clearly indicates that these hollow spheres have a diameter of 300–800 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†), and their Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (Fig. S3, ESI†) exhibits quite a high value, 47.3 m2 g−1, for more adsorption of the dye molecules.
To demonstrate the visible range scattering effect of the submicron-sized hollow TiO2 spheres on the improvement of photovoltaic performance for DSCs, a bilayer photoelectrode was constructed by coating a ∼10 μm layer of the hollow TiO2 on top of a ∼10 μm layer of commercial TiO2 P25 (Fig. 3), and was further tested under an illumination of one sun condition (AM 1.5 globe, 100 mW cm−2) to compare with that of a pure P25 photoelectrode-based device. The characteristic current (I)–voltage (V) curves are displayed in Fig. 4, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1, showing that the short-circuit current (Jsc, 15.9 mA cm−2) for the DSC with a bilayer photoelectrode is significantly improved in comparison with that for the pristine P25 TiO2 nanoparticles based one (Jsc, 12.4 mA cm−2). Since the amount of dye adsorption on the hollow TiO2 is controlled to be similar to that of the P25 nanoparticles based device, as shown in Table 1, the enhanced photocurrent is most likely to be attributed to the visible light-matched hollow structured TiO2 scattering layer for a higher light-harvesting efficiency. Furthermore, the diffused reflectance spectra (Fig. S4, ESI†) also show that the submicron-sized hollow TiO2 exhibits an improvement 2–3 times of the diffused reflectance value (%R) in the full visible range, which further supports that the submicrometer-sized spherical nanoshell structure could facilitate the coupling of visible light into the resonant modes, resulting in substantial enhancement of the light path.13,18,19 As a result, the overall photoconversion efficiency (η) of the hollow TiO2 DSC achieves 7.48%, which is higher than the P25 based DSC (∼6.21%) measured in parallel experiments by 21% and that reported in the literature (∼5.14%) by 46%.20 The newly developed micrometer-sized hollow structure of TiO2 including the multiple shells as the scattering layer can only improve the power conversion efficiency by no more than ∼12% compared to the pristine P25 device.14,21 Thus, we propose that the enhancement is due to the submicron-sized hollow spherical structure, which matches well with the visible light as a scattering layer to intimately correspond to the main adsorption range of the N719 dye for significant improvement of the device power conversion efficiency.

In order to understand the interfacial transfer of photoexcited electrons in DSCs, in particular the difference of the interfacial characteristics between P25 and hollow TiO2, we measured the device electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at an applied bias of Voc and a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 105 Hz, with AC amplitude of 15 mV in a simulated solar light of 100 mW cm−2. The EIS spectra measured at the open circuit voltage can be used to analyse the interfacial charge transfer, charge recombination and charge transport process in the photelectrode. Fig. 5 shows two well-defined semicircles in the Nyquist plots, which can represent the charge transfer for redox reaction of I−/I3− at the counter Pt electrode/electrolyte interface (over 1000 Hz) and the electron transfer/charge recombination at the photoanode oxide/dye/electrolyte interface (1–100 Hz), respectively. The semicircles for the hollow TiO2 electrode are smaller than those for the pristine P25 electrode, indicating faster electron transfer at the hollow TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.22,23 In addition, the Bode plots (Fig. 5, inset) illustrate that the frequency peak position at the oxide/dye/electrolyte interface is 9 Hz for a hollow TiO2 based DSC, which is much lower than that (14 Hz) of the P25 based one. In terms of the relation τr = 1/2πfmax (fmax is the peak frequency), the hollow TiO2 electrode has a much longer electron lifetime than that of the P25 electrode for much weaker charge recombination. The fast charge transfer rate could be possibly ascribed to the higher light absorption efficiency from the hollow TiO2 electrode to drive the dye injecting more electrons while reducing the recombination process.

In brief, hollow structured TiO2 spheres matching well with visible light as a scattering layer for photoelectrodes have been synthesized by a direct self-assembly method from commercial TiO2 nanoparticles without any template or surfactant. The submicrometer-sized hollow TiO2 exhibits an overall conversion efficiency of 7.48%. Moreover, the synthesis method is facile, inexpensive and mass-manufacturable, thus rendering promising merits for industrialization.
