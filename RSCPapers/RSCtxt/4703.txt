    , Accepted 28th February 2020First published on 1st March 2020AbstractTransition metal nitrides (TMNs) are emerging as a feasible alternative to noble metal co-catalysts in photocatalytic hydrogen production. Considering the recent prospects created by multicomponent systems, it is reasonable to investigate multi-component TMNs for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Herein, in an effort in that direction, ternary chromium-titanium nitride (Cr0.5Ti0.5N) nanoparticles have been synthesized by a solid–solid phase separation method, resulting in highly efficient co-catalysts for promoting photocatalytic hydrogen production of semiconductors under visible light irradiation. Both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that ternary Cr0.5Ti0.5N offers a comprehensive advantage by boosting the photo-induced charge carrier separation and migration, improving the reaction kinetics as compared to those of TiN and CrN. Therefore, the optimal Cr0.5Ti0.5N-based sample exhibits the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 2.44 mmol g−1 h−1, and has ∼120 times better kinetics than the reference pure CdS sample. In fact, this result even surpasses that of Pt-based nanocomposites (2.06 mmol g−1 h−1).
Introduction
Hydrogen as a fuel holds great promise in the development of a clean, scalable and sustainable carbon-free energy society; this is due to its high gravimetric energy density and environmental friendliness.1,2 Ever since Fujishima and Honda successfully produced H2 through photoelectrochemical water splitting using a TiO2 electrode, solar hydrogen (H2) production using semiconductor-based photocatalysts has been considered a plausible means for converting solar energy into storable fuels.3–5 Many attempts have been reported for water splitting based H2 production, including the use of metal oxides,6–9 metal sulfides,11–13 metal oxynitrides,14–16 and metal-free semiconductors.17,18 The primary drawback associated with a pure phase semiconductor has to do with fast charge recombination, which severely limits the photocatalytic efficiency.19,20 Therefore, loading an active cocatalyst on semiconductors is a reasonable way to develop an efficient photocatalytic H2 production system.21,22 Although Pt and Pt-based materials are the most efficient cocatalysts, the cost of Pt severely restricts its application on an industrial scale.23–25 To this end, exploring earth-abundant and catalytically active non-noble-metal-based catalysts, such as transition metal oxides,26,27 phosphides,28–30 sulfides,13,31 selenides,32,33 and carbides,34,35 is of relevance.
Recent advances have demonstrated transition metal nitrides (TMNs) such as Co3N,36 Ni3N37 and Fe4N38 to be promising co-catalytic materials for photocatalytic H2 production. It has been reported that TMN compounds are metallic interstitial compounds, where the nitrogen atoms go to the interstices of the metal-based framework. This does not deleteriously impact the metallic properties but influences the electronic properties of the metal by increasing the density of electrons on the surface. This makes TMN compounds suitable for the hydrogen production reaction.39,40 However, pure phase TMN materials in the nanosize regime are hard to obtain because of their harsh preparation conditions. Therefore, studies on TMN-based materials in water splitting H2 production are still in their infancy. Especially, a systematic investigation of multi-component TMNs as alternatives to Pt in photocatalytic hydrogen production has been hitherto missing.
Herein, nanosized ternary chromium titanium nitride (Cr0.5Ti0.5N) nanoparticles are synthesized as co-catalysts, and as alternatives to Pt. The synthesis is carried out using a solid–solid phase separation method. Choosing a typical semiconductor, CdS, as an example, a series of binary (TiN–CdS and CrN–CdS) and ternary (Cr0.5Ti0.5N–CdS) nanocomposites have been synthesized for visible-light-driven H2 production. A systematic theoretical and experimental comparison between binary TMNs and ternary TMNs demonstrates that TMNs as co-catalysts improve the photocatalytic performance of the semiconductors with synergistic effects; the performance enhancement, in fact, is superior when compared to that of the ‘parent’ binary TMN phases. Cr0.5Ti0.5N evidently supports the separation and migration of photo-generated charge carriers, and also offers accelerated reaction kinetics. Thus, the optimal Cr0.5Ti0.5N–CdS sample exhibits a photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 2.44 mmol g−1 h−1 which is higher than that of TiN–CdS (0.91 mmol g−1 h−1) and CrN–CdS (0.79 mmol g−1 h−1), respectively. It is hoped that this pilot work can provide new insight into constructing novel ternary TMN-based photocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production.
Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals are of analytical grade and are obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Titanium dioxide (TiO2), chromic oxide (Cr2O3), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) are purchased from Aladdin Chemicals (China). Cadmium chloride (CdCl2), sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate (C5H10NNaS2·3H2O), ethylenediamine (C2H8N2), absolute ethanol (C2H6O), and lactic acid (C3H6O3) are purchased from Sinopharm, China. Deionized water is prepared using a distillation unit.
Materials synthesis

Synthesis of CdS nanowires. 
Uniform CdS NWs are fabricated as described in a previous report.41 In a typical process, 1.124 g of cadmium diethyldithiocarbamate (Cd(S2CNEt2)2), prepared by precipitation from a stoichiometric mixture of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate and cadmium chloride in deionized water, is added to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of 50 mL. Then, the autoclave is filled with 40 mL of ethylenediamine to 80% of the total volume. The autoclave is maintained at 453 K for 24 h and then allowed to cool to room temperature. A yellowish precipitate is collected and washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water to remove the residue of organic solvents. The final products are dried in an oven at 333 K for 12 h.


Synthesis of transition metal nitrides (TMNs). 
Cr0.5Ti0.5N, TiN, and CrN are prepared by a solid–solid separation method reported previously with some modification.42 The solid solution of the Zn containing metal oxide precursors (ZMO) is first prepared by preheating the specific mixture of metal oxides of ZnO, Cr2O3 and TiO2 at 800 °C for 4 h followed by heating at 5°C min−1 under argon. Cr0.5Ti0.5N is prepared by ammonolysis of about 0.5 g of ZMO in an alumina boat. Argon gas is passed over the sample for 15 min to expel air before establishing a flow of ammonia gas (150 cm3 min−1). The ZMO is heated to 950 °C at a heating rate of 2.5 °C min−1. The furnace power is turned off after 4 h and the product is cooled to room temperature in ∼4 h under an ammonia flow. Before the silica tube is taken out of the split tube furnace, argon gas is flowed through the tube to expel the ammonia gas. The silica tube is left in the lab for 24 h with one valve open in order to expose the ammonolysis product to air slowly.


Preparation of negatively charged TMNs. 
The TMNs with different weight ratios are dispersed in 30 mL of water by sonication for 30 min. Then, 100 mg sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is added under vigorous stirring. The TMNs reacted with SDS for 4 h at room temperature. Finally, SDS-modified TMNs are sufficiently rinsed with ethanol to wash away any remaining SDS moiety and fully dried at 333 K in an oven.43


Fabrication of TMN decorated CdS nanowire (TMN–CdS) composites. 
In a typical process, 60 mg CdS NWs is dispersed in 100 mL of water by sonication for 30 min. Then, different amounts (the weight ratio of TMNs at 1–15%) of negatively charged TMNs are added into a dispersion of positively charged CdS NWs with vigorous stirring. After mixing for 4 h, the mixture is centrifuged and washed with deionized water and fully dried at 333 K in an oven to obtain a series of TMN–CdS composites with different loading amounts (denoted as TMN-x-CdS, where x is the theoretical loading amount of TMN nanoparticles, namely x wt%). And then the TMN–CdS is subsequently rapidly annealed to 600 °C for 0.5 h in an NH3 atmosphere.


Characterization. 
The crystal structure of solid samples is characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku Miniflex 600, Japan) in the 2θ range of 10–90° at a scan rate of 1° min−1. The diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples are measured in the 200–800 nm range using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-vis DRS, Hitachi U-3900, Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere attachment. Photoluminescence spectra (PL) are measured using a Horiba JobinYvon Fluoromax 4C-L, France. The morphologies of samples are characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800, Japan). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping are performed on a Thermo Fisher Talos-F200x TEM/STEM with a spherical aberration corrector. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra are collected using an AXIS Ultra DLD (Shimadzu, Japan) spectrometer with Al Kα excitation (1486.6 eV).
Photoelectrochemical analysis is conducted in a homemade three-electrode cell. A Pt plate is employed as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl electrode is used as the reference electrode. The working electrode is prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (ITO) glass that is cleaned by sonication in ethanol for 30 min and dried at 353 K. The boundary of the ITO glass is protected using Scotch tape. 5 mg sample and 30 μL Nafion solution (5 wt%) are dispersed in 1 mL of DMF by sonication to obtain a slurry. Then, 40 μL of the slurry is spread onto the pretreated ITO glass. After 1 hour storage in air at room temperature, the working electrode is further dried at 393 K for 2 h to improve adhesion. Then, the Scotch tape is removed, and the uncoated part of the electrode is isolated with epoxy resin. A 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfect light Co., Ltd.) with a UV-CUT filter to cut off the light of wavelength λ < 420 nm is used as the irradiation source. Under visible light irradiation, photocurrent measurements are carried out on a BAS Epsilon workstation without bias and the electrolyte chosen is 0.2 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution without an additive. The cyclic voltammetry curves are obtained under similar conditions to photocurrent measurements except for light irradiation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are performed using an EIS spectrometer (CHI-760C workstation, CH Instruments) in a three-electrode cell in the presence of 0.5 M KCl solution containing 10.0 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6] by applying an AC voltage with a 5 mV amplitude in a frequency range from 1 Hz to 100 kHz.


Photocatalytic H2 production. 
Photocatalytic experiments are carried out in a Pyrex vessel, which is attached to a closed gas-circulation and evacuation system. The photoreduction of H2O to H2 is performed by dispersing 20 mg of the photocatalyst in an 80 mL aqueous solution containing 8 mL lactic acid as the sacrificial agent. In a typical photocatalytic reaction, a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfect light Co., Ltd.) with a UV-CUT filter to cut off the light of wavelength λ < 420 nm is used as the irradiation source. Continuous magnetic stirring is applied at the bottom of the reactor in order to keep the photocatalyst in a suspension state throughout the experiments. The temperature of the reaction solution is maintained at 278 K by a flow of cooling water during the reaction. The evolved H2 is in situ monitored periodically using an online gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (Scion GC7900, Ar as the carrier gas).

Results and discussion
The successful fabrication of ternary Cr0.5Ti0.5N, binary TiN, and CrN via a solid–solid phase separation method has been proven by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As shown in Fig. S1,† all of the as-synthesized TMN nanoparticles exhibit a pure rocksalt structure with a face-centered cubic phase. The diffraction peaks of Cr0.5Ti0.5N, TiN and CrN match well with the diffraction file JCPDS no. 01-070-2981, 03-065-565 and 03-065-901, respectively. The diffraction peaks of Cr0.5Ti0.5N without splitting indicate the successful formation of pure ternary Cr0.5Ti0.5N instead of TiN–CrN heterostructures. Moreover, the transformation of the electronic and optical absorption properties also supports the transformation from transition metal oxide (TMO) precursors (TiO2 and Cr2O3) to transition metal nitrides (TMNs). Fig. S2† displays the Nyquist plots derived from electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) measurements. The decreased semicircle radius of TMNs as compared to those of TMOs demonstrates the better conductivity of TMNs. In addition, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) of TMOs and TMNs are characterized in Fig. S3†. All of the pure TMN samples show typical metallic characters that absorb all photons while TMOs exhibit semiconductor properties with absorption edges. Notably, the absorption intensity of CrN is the highest, followed by Cr0.5Ti0.5N and TiN.
The morphologies of Cr0.5Ti0.5N, TiN and CrN are characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. As shown in Fig. 1 and S4,† all of the TMNs exhibit similar irregular nanoparticles with a size of 30–60 nm. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the Cr0.5Ti0.5N, TiN and CrN nanoparticles display well-resolved lattice fringes with interplanar distances of 0.21 nm, 0.212 nm and 0.207 nm, which are assigned to the (200) planes of Cr0.5Ti0.5N, TiN and CrN, respectively (Fig. 1e, S5, and S6†). Besides, the high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and the elemental mapping images of TMNs indicate the homogeneous distribution of metal and nitrogen elements, which further confirms the formation of TMNs (Fig. 1f).

In order to further investigate the chemical states of these TMN nanoparticles, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been utilized. As shown in Fig. 1g–i and S7† the XPS survey spectrum of Cr0.5Ti0.5N indicates the existence of Ti, Cr, N, and O elements while Ti, N, and O and Cr, N, and O are observed in the survey spectra of TiN and CrN, respectively. The high-resolution Ti 2p spectrum of TiN displays peaks at 455.6 eV (2p3/2) and 461.3 eV (2p1/2), matching with the metallic state of Ti, while the peaks at 456.7 eV (2p3/2) and 462.1 eV (2p1/2) are assigned to the Ti–O–N bonds. The Ti–O peak at 485.5 eV is achieved, revealing the slightly oxidized surface of TiN.44,45 Combined with the observation of the metal–nitride peak at 396.8 eV for N 1s of TiN, the formation of TiN can be further confirmed. Similarly, the peaks at 575.4 eV and 577.1 eV are assigned to Cr–N and Cr–O–N bonds, respectively. This can also be observed from the Cr 2p spectrum of CrN. The N 1s spectrum of CrN exhibits a metal-nitride peak at 396.6 eV. When compared to binary TMNs, ternary Cr0.5Ti0.5N exhibits a shift of over 0.2 eV towards higher binding energy for metal–N bonds. On the other hand, metal–O–N peaks move in the opposite direction, indicating the reduced electron density of the metal (Ti and Cr) atoms in the metal–N bond and increased electron density of the metal atoms in the metal–O–N bond in the case of Cr0.5Ti0.5N. Moreover, the N 1s spectrum of Cr0.5Ti0.5N exhibits a metal-nitride peak at 396.9 eV while the N–H peaks of all the samples are at 399.1 eV.45–47 These XPS peak shifts are attributed to the changes of TiN and CrN chemical states in ternary nitride Cr0.5Ti0.5N and confirm the formation of ternary nitride Cr0.5Ti0.5N instead of a simple mixture of TiN and CrN.45,46 The data summarized in Table S1† exhibits the relative content of metal–N in Cr0.5Ti0.5N (23.87 at%); this is slightly higher than that seen in TiN and CrN (the relative contents for TiN and CrN are 21.2 at% and 20.28 at%, respectively). It is known that increasing the metal–N amounts could increase the number of active sites and promote the conductivity of TMN samples.36 This contributes to the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of TMN-based samples.

Fig. 2a displays the synthesis process of TMN–CdS nanocomposites. In brief, positively charged CdS nanowires (CdS NWs) with a diameter in the range of 50–100 nm and a length in the range of 0.5–3 μm have been synthesized by a solvothermal method (Fig. S8†).41 Then, the TMN nanoparticles have been modified with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) molecules to produce a negatively charged surface (Fig. S9†).43 Thus, various amounts of TMN nanoparticles (from 0 to 15 wt%) can be easily deposited on the surface of CdS NWs via electrostatic interactions. The ratio of TMN–CdS could be precisely regulated by altering the molar ratio of the TMN nanoparticles. Finally, an ammonia heating step is carried out to enhance the interfacial contact between CdS and TMNs, to ensure the formation of well-bonded TMN–CdS nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. S8 and S10,† NH3 heating treatment does not affect the crystal structure and morphology of the substrate samples.

The morphology of TMN–CdS nanocomposites has been characterized by SEM and TEM measurements. As shown in Fig. 2 and S11,† TMN–CdS nanocomposites mainly retain a 1D morphology while TMN nanoparticles with a size of 30–60 nm can be easily found on the surface of CdS NWs. HRTEM images further confirm the interfacial contact between CdS NWs and TMN nanoparticles. Fig. 2e–g provide lattice fringes with d-spacing values of 0.212 nm, 0.243 nm, and 0.207 nm corresponding to the (200), (111) and (200) atomic planes of TiN, Cr0.5Ti0.5N, and CrN, respectively. Besides, distinct lattice fringes with d-spacing values of 0.207 nm and 0.316 nm, which can be assigned to the (100) and (101) facets of CdS, are also observed in all of the TMN–CdS samples. Therefore, it can be concluded that the 1D morphology and crystal structure of TMNs and CdS are maintained during the synthesis of TMN–CdS nanocomposites. XRD analysis data provide further proof. As shown in Fig. S12,† a series of TMN–CdS nanocomposites mainly exhibit a hexagonal wurtzite structure of CdS (JCPDS no. 00-65-0314). With the increase of TMN nanoparticles over 5 wt%, diffraction peaks of TiN (42.6° corresponding to the (200) plane), Cr0.5Ti0.5N (37° corresponding to the (111) plane) and CrN (37.6° corresponding to the (111) plane) can be observed. The optical properties of a series of TMN–CdS samples have also been measured by UV-vis DRS analysis (Fig. S13†). For pure CdS, a sharp absorption edge at around 520 nm is observed, corresponding to a band gap of 2.4 eV, which is consistent with typical CdS materials in previous reports.10–13,31 Loading TMN nanoparticles onto the CdS scaffold obviously increases the optical absorption intensity of CdS NWs in the visible region with a slight red-shift. With increasing the loading amount of TMN nanoparticles, gradual enhancement of optical absorption intensities and red-shifts for TMN–CdS are observed.
The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (PHER) performances of a series of 1D TMN–CdS nanocomposites have been tested under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). As shown in Fig. S14 and S15,† the optimal ratios of the TMN nanoparticles for these samples are 5 wt% for CrN–CdS, 10 wt% for TiN–CdS and 12 wt% for Cr0.5Ti0.5N–CdS, respectively (denoted as CrN-5-CdS, TiN-10-CdS, and Cr0.5Ti0.5N-12-CdS). Excessive amounts of TMN nanoparticles would act as charge-carrier recombination centers in TMN–CdS nanocomposites. Thus, the PHER performances of the samples decrease with the continuous increase in the loading amounts of TMN nanoparticles. A similar trend can be observed in Pt–CdS nanocomposites. The optimal Pt-0.5-CdS exhibits the highest H2 evolution rate for the Pt–CdS series of samples. Controlled experiments have proven that the active component is CdS, as expected. As shown in Fig. S16,† all of the pure TMN nanoparticles including TiN, CrN and Cr0.5Ti0.5N exhibit trace H2 evolution amounts while pure CdS NWs show photocatalytic performances of 20.5 μmol g−1 h−1. Fig. 3a displays a comparison of the photocatalytic H2 evolution rate toward various optimal TMN–CdS and Pt–CdS samples. It is found that the H2 evolution rate of 1D TMN–CdS and Pt–CdS nanocomposites increases in the sequence of Cr0.5Ti0.5N-12-CdS (2.44 mmol g−1 h−1) > Pt-0.5-CdS (2.06 mmol g−1 h−1) > TiN-10-CdS (0.91 mmol g−1 h−1) > CrN-5-CdS (0.79 mmol g−1 h−1). Cr0.5Ti0.5N-12-CdS exhibits the highest H2 evolution rate, which is about 2.7 times and 3.1 times higher than those of TiN-10-CdS and CrN-5-CdS, and over 120 times higher than that of pure CdS NWs. In order to eliminate the influence of different loading amounts on catalytic activity, we used the dye sensitization method to carry out the control experiment. The Cr0.5Ti0.5N-EY system exhibits the highest H2 evolution rate, Cr0.5Ti0.5N-EY (1.39 mmol g−1 h−1) > TiN-EY (0.92 mmol g−1 h−1) > CrN-EY (0.65 mmol g−1 h−1), which is about 2.1 times and 1.5 times higher than those of CrN-EY and TiN-EY (Fig. S17†). The results are found to be similar to the results of the case with TMN–CdS. Due to the differences in the various reaction systems and reaction conditions, systematic comparisons of the photocatalytic activities over different samples are hard to perform. Nevertheless, the H2 evolution rate enhancement in this work is still considerable through a rough comparison to other TMN-based photocatalysts (Table S2†). Recycling experiments and long-term online tests for the PHER using Cr0.5Ti0.5N-12-CdS nanocomposites exhibit hardly any decreased activity after 6 cycles of photo-reaction and 96 h of light irradiation, respectively (Fig. S18†). This demonstrates the considerable photo-stability of Cr0.5Ti0.5N-12-CdS for the PHER. In addition, the catalyst after 6 cycles shows similar XRD patterns and SEM morphology to those of the fresh sample (Fig. S19†), which further confirms the photo-stability of TMN–CdS samples during the photocatalytic reaction.

To further study the effects of different TMNs in promoting photocatalytic activity on various TMN–CdS nanocomposites, a series of photoluminescence (PL) and photo-electrochemical (PEC) measurements have been performed. As shown in Fig. 3b, all of the TMN–CdS samples show a strong intrinsic emission band with a peak at 500–550 nm, which is attributed to the direct electron–hole recombination transition across the band gap of CdS. A series of TMN–CdS nanocomposites show obviously decreased PL intensities as compared to that of CdS. This indicates that the recombination of photon-generated electrons and holes in TMN–CdS nanocomposites is effectively inhibited.36,47,48 However, CrN–CdS exhibits the weakest PL intensity which suggests more efficient inhibition of charge carrier recombination for CrN as compared to those for TiN and Cr0.5Ti0.5N. Transient photocurrent–time (I–t) curves display a similar trend as shown in Fig. 3c and S20.† CrN-5-CdS has the best photocurrent density in a series of CrN–CdS (Fig. S20†). TiN-10-CdS and Cr0.5Ti0.5N-12-CdS have similar results to CrN–(5)–CdS. It can be seen that photocurrent densities of the samples increase in the sequence of CrN-5-CdS > Cr0.5Ti0.5N-12-CdS > TiN-10-CdS > CdS. This demonstrates that TMN nanoparticles can serve as an effective electron trap to facilitate the separation of charge carriers photo-generated from photo-excited CdS (Fig. 3c).49–52
Nyquist plots derived from EIS measurements show results consistent with the above PL and PEC analysis. As indicated in Fig. 3d, the CrN–CdS nanocomposite shows the lowest semicircle radius as compared to other samples, suggesting that the smallest resistance and the most efficient transfer of charge carriers between the CrN–CdS electrode and electrolyte solution are obtained.53–56 This result is in agreement with the electronic conductivities of the pure TMN nanoparticles (Fig. S21†). However, the polarization curves of TMN samples exhibit an opposite trend to PL and PEC results. As shown in Fig. 3e, TiN exhibits the lowest H2 evolution over-potential while CrN displays the highest H2 evolution over-potential. This result is in agreement with a previous report.56 This indicates that the migration and separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes are major contributors but are not sufficient to improve the TMN–CdS hydrogen production rate of photocatalysis.57,58 As shown in Fig. 3f, since the electrochemically active surface area may also affect the catalytic activity, the electrochemical surface areas of CrN, TiN, and Cr0.5Ti0.5N NPs are estimated by measuring the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl; Fig. S22†).58 The measured Cdl values are approximately 24.8, 20.2, and 14.6 μF cm−2 for TiN, Cr0.5Ti0.5N, and CrN, respectively. TiN has a higher number of active sites than CrN and Cr0.5Ti0.5N for HER catalysis, but does not show the best H2 evolution rate among the TMN–CdS samples. While the electrochemically active surface area is an indicator of important reference values for photocatalysis, it is not the only factor affecting the activity. In any case, Cr0.5Ti0.5N–CdS shows the highest photocatalytic H2 activity in TMN–CdS, which may indicate that the ternary co-catalyst (Cr0.5Ti0.5N) offers the benefit of synergy between CrN and TiN, and hence raises the photocatalytic hydrogen production capacity on the CdS surface.
To reveal the origin of the aforementioned properties of these metal nitrides, theoretical calculations are carried out using density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the Quantum Espresso (QE) package. The computational methodology can be found in the ESI.† At first glance, the metallic nature of all these nitrides and the covalent nature of bonding between the metal and N atoms are clear considering the Density of States (DOS) plots shown in Fig. 4d–f. However, below the Fermi levels two distinct regions could be interestingly separated by the pseudo-gaps. The energy regions below the pseudo-gaps are primarily formed by 3p-electron states of N, while on the left side of the pseudo-gaps the dominant population arises from 4d-electron states of Ti, Cr or both metals in the Cr0.5Ti0.5N structure. The pseudogaps in the density of states appear near −2.15 eV (TiN), −2.64 eV (Cr0.5Ti0.5N) and −2.87 eV (CrN), respectively. The partial DOS of Cr0.5Ti0.5N illustrates that the d orbitals of Cr and also Ti contribute significantly to the total DOS. It is expected that by replacing Cr atoms in the Ti sites of the TiN crystal, the metallic characteristics would be enhanced. This expectation seems fulfilled regarding the enhanced density on the Fermi levels in Fig. 4d compared to those in Fig. 4f. In addition, the pseudogap positions are red-shifted in order, which indicates that the electronic state of the energy region near the Fermi level is now more dominated by the orbital electrons of the metal atom, and the metallicity of the system is sequentially enhanced relative to TiN and is still lower but closer to that of the CrN crystal.59

Based on the above results, a possible photocatalytic reaction mechanism using TMN–CdS materials is proposed and shown in Scheme S1 (see details in the ESI†). Under visible light irradiation, CdS NWs are photo-excited to induce electron–hole pairs. Fast recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs could occur on the surface and bulk in CdS NWs, resulting in a low H2 evolution rate (Scheme S1a†). With the introduction of TMN nanoparticles on the surface of CdS NWs, a typical metallic interstitial compound–semiconductor interface has been created. Thus, the photo-excited electrons can quickly transfer from the conduction band (CB) of CdS NWs to the surface of TMN nanoparticles through these interfaces which are in contact, promoting separation and transfer of the charge carriers. Meanwhile, the photo-induced holes in the valence band (VB) could be consumed by the use of lactic acid as the hole scavenger.57 Moreover, TMN nanoparticles accelerate the H2 evolution kinetics by decreasing the over-potential of TMN–CdS samples. Thus, TMN–CdS samples exhibit an improved H2 evolution rate under visible light irradiation as compared to CdS NWs (Scheme S1b†).
Conclusions
In conclusion, a series of 1D binary (CrN and TiN) and ternary (Cr0.5Ti0.5N) TMN–CdS nanocomposites have been successfully synthesized for photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation. Both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have demonstrated that ternary Cr0.5Ti0.5N displays synergistic advantages in boosting photo-generated charge carrier separation and migration as well as accelerating reaction kinetics. Therefore, the optimal Cr0.5Ti0.5N–CdS sample exhibits the highest photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 2.44 mmol g−1 h−1. It is not only better than that of TiN–CdS and CrN–CdS (0.91 mmol g−1 h−1 and 0.79 mmol g−1 h−1, respectively) but also better than that of Pt–CdS nanocomposites (2.06 mmol g−1 h−1). This pilot work provides a feasible paradigm in the rational design of novel ternary TMN-based photocatalysts for efficient solar energy conversion.
