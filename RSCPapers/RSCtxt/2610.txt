    , Accepted 3rd July 2021First published on 5th July 2021AbstractHerein, a MOF derived transition metal sulfide (Co3S4) with a metallic characteristic is introduced to create an ohmic contacted Co3S4–CN heterojunction interface. By virtue of electron injection from the lower work function Co3S4 to the g-CN semiconductor, an intensive interfacial electric field is produced and causes downward band bending of g-CN. This Co3S4–CN heterojunction not only accelerates the exciton dissociation, but also eliminates the potential barrier for majority carrier (electron) extraction from g-CN, which synergistically promotes the charge separation. The Co3S4 mediated performance enhancement in hydrogen production is proven to be comparable with that of noble metal Pt, and the as-obtained CNCo-3 exhibits superior photocatalytic activity in visible light driven hydrogen evolution (∼217.0 μmol g−1 h−1). The findings uncover the fundamental mechanism of metallic sulfide mediated charge separation and pave the way for regulating interface charge separation in photocatalysis through the use of other metallic sulfides (e.g. Ni2S).
1. Introduction
Solar driven hydrogen production via photocatalytic water splitting represents a fascinating technology to produce renewable clean fuel in a sustainable manner.1–3 To this end, with continuous efforts devoted to the exploration of efficient photocatalysts, a large number of semiconductors have been developed.4–9 The past few decades have witnessed the tremendous growth of conjugated polymer semiconductors due to their low cost, tunable structure, broad spectral response and photochemical stability.10,11 Among them, graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) is undoubtedly the most extensively investigated polymer photocatalyst in water splitting, artificial photosynthesis and pollutant degradation.12–15 However, the current g-CN photocatalysts aimed at direct solar-to-hydrogen conversion have always suffered from low efficiency. This is mainly due to the fact that the dominant exciton effect has not only localized the photoexcited electrons and holes within the heptazine units, but also confined the intermolecular charge transport in the 1D π-stacking direction.16,17 Hence, it is of significant importance to explore effective ways of improving the intrinsic charge separation and steering the charge flow towards surface reactive sites.
Noble metals have been widely used as surface modifiers to extract charge carriers from the semiconductor.18 However, this methodology can hardly be realized in practical application due to the high cost and notorious Fermi pinning effect. Recently, interfacial charge modulation via the introduction of cost-effective wide band gap semiconductors has emerged as a simple but effective way to promote charge separation and extraction. For example, Tao et al. demonstrated a surface modulation strategy for strengthening the built-in electric field and band bending of semiconductors (Bi4TaO8X, g-CN, CdS) via introducing a MoO3 modifier as an electron acceptor.19 Lin et al. achieved efficient water splitting with wide band gap LaOCl modified g-CN through a single photon excitation process.20 Alternatively, metallic transition metal sulfides (MTMSs) represent a type of new promising candidate for modulating the charge separation and surface reaction owing to their fascinating electronic structure and unique metallic characteristic.21–23 Very recently, by using the large work function NiS, She and coworkers designed a noble-metal-free Schottky junction to accelerate the charge kinetics in g-CN.24 Most importantly, MTMSs including 1T-MoS2, 1T-WS2, TaS2, NbS2, and Co3S4 can serve as efficient cocatalysts in photo-/electro-catalytic hydrogen production because a large number of reactive sites are available at their crystal edges and/or basal plane.25–29
With regard to the n-type g-CN that has suffered from a severe exciton effect, MTMSs in principle are perceived as ideal interfacial modulators to provide a low-loss contact interface and reactive sites for both charge flow regulation and the surface reaction process.30,31 There have been several pioneering research studies on MTMS modified g-CN systems, in which a significant improvement in charge separation efficiency and reaction kinetics has been achieved through the use of metallic sulfides (NbS2, Co3S4, and Co9S8).32–37 However, the exact role of MTMSs in photocatalysis was unclear and MTMSs were treated as semiconducting materials in most cases regardless of their unique metallic characteristic.33–36 This incomplete understanding has greatly limited the application of MTMSs in interfacial charge modulation. Thus, it is of great interest to explore the effect of MTMS modified g-CN and clarify the mechanism of MTMS mediated charge separation.
Herein, we synthesized ohmic contacted metallic sulfide–semiconductor heterostructures (Co3S4–CN and NiS2–CN) and investigated the effect of metallic sulfide mediated exciton dissociation and charge separation in g-CN. The heterojunction was facilely synthesized by loading MOF derived metallic Co3S4 or NiS2 on the surface of g-CN in situ. Both theoretical simulation and experimental results indicated that an ohmic junction interface with an intensive built-in electric field was formed. The Co3S4 modification not only decreased the exciton binding energy, but also drove spatial separation of electrons and holes. Thus, the surface energy band of g-CN bent downward towards the interface and created a barrier-free pathway for electron extraction from the bulk. As a result, highly efficient exciton splitting and spatial separation of electrons/holes were realized, which synergistically contributed to boosting photocatalytic H2 production. The as-obtained CNCo-3 exhibited greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity in visible light driven hydrogen evolution (∼217.0 μmol g−1 h−1), which was more than 1000 times that of pristine g-CN (∼0.2 μmol g−1 h−1).
2. Experimental and theoretical section
2.1 Computational methods
All the calculations were performed within the framework of the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Software Package (VASP 5.3.5) code within the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation and the projected augmented wave (PAW) method.38–41 The cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis set was set to 400 eV. The ultrasoft pseudo-potential was employed to describe the interaction between valence electrons and the ionic core. Monkhorst–Pack special k-point meshes of 3 × 3 × 1 were proposed to carry out geometry optimization and electronic structure calculation. During the geometry optimization, all atoms were allowed to relax without any constraints until the convergence thresholds of maximum force and energy were smaller than 0.01 eV Å−1 and 1.0 × 10−5 eV per atom, respectively. A vacuum layer of 12 Å was introduced to avoid interactions between periodic images.
2.2 Preparation of photocatalysts
g-CN was synthesized by thermal polymerization using melamine as a precursor. Typically, 10 g melamine was put into a porcelain combustion boat and heated to 823 K for 2 hour with a ramp rate of 2.2 K min−1. After cooling down to ambient temperature, g-CN was obtained as a yellow powder. g-CN derived from dicyandiamide was also prepared and named as CN-DCDA for photocatalytic activity comparison. Co-ZIF (ZIF-67) was prepared following a reported method with some modifications.42 Precursor solutions containing ligand and metal ions were firstly obtained by dissolving 2-methylimidazole (2.624 g) and cobalt nitrite hexahydrate (1.17 g) into 100 mL methanol solution, respectively. After mixing the precursor solutions under stirring for 15 min, the solution was kept for 24 h for crystal growth. Finally, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with methanol 3 times. After drying at 333 K in a vacuum oven overnight, ZIF-67 was obtained for further use. Ni-MOF was synthesized by a previously reported method.43 1,4-Benzenedicarboxylic acid (119.0 mg, 0.5 mmol) and nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (83.0 mg, 0.5 mmol) were added into a solution mixture containing DMF (32 mL), ethanol (2 mL), and deionized water (2 mL). After the solution was stirred for 5 min, 0.5 mL triethylamine was added into the solution. After stirring for another 8 h, the resulting product was collected via centrifugation, and washed with ethanol 3 times. CNCo-X series were synthesized by in situ sulfurization via a one-step hydrothermal method. Typically, taking CNCo-3 as an example, 3 mg ZIF-67 and 97 mg carbon nitride were added into 5 mL deionized water under stirring, and then thiourea (1.52 g) was added into the mixture as the S source. After stirring for 30 min, the solution was transferred into an autoclave with Teflon lining and heated to 473 K for 2 h. Finally, the photocatalyst was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and methanol 3 times. After drying at 333 K in a vacuum oven overnight, CNCo-3 was obtained for further use. For other CNCo-X samples, the experimental conditions were kept the same as those of CNCo-3 while the amount of ZIF-67 was changed to 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 mg (the total weight of ZIF-67 and g-CN was fixed at 100 mg). CNNi-X samples were synthesized by the same method as that of CNCo-X using Ni-MOF and g-CN as precursors. For comparison, three control samples were prepared: CN-HT was prepared by hydrothermally treating g-CN without the addition of ZIF-67 and thiourea; CN-S was prepared without the addition of ZIF-67; and ZIF-S was prepared from ZIF-67 and thiourea without g-CN.
2.3 Materials characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer equipped with a nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation source. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were recorded with a Hitachi S4800 FE-SEM. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a JEM-2100 electron microscope. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet NEXUS870 spectrometer using KBr as a support. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-DRS) of samples were collected with a Thermo Fisher Evolution 220 spectrometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a Thermo Fisher Luminar spectrophotometer under 380 nm light excitation. Time resolved photoluminescence spectra (TRPL) were recorded with a Horiba Jobin Yvon Data Station by time-correlated single-photon counting. In situ Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurement was performed on a Bruker Dimension Icon AFM under both dark and light irradiation (365 nm LED, 150 W).
2.4 Electrochemical measurement
The electrochemical experiment was conducted on an electrochemical workstation (CHI-660E, Shanghai Chenhua, China). All the measurements were performed in a standard three-electrode cell with 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 (pH 6.8) as an electrolyte solution. Pt wire and Ag/AgCl electrodes were employed as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The working electrode was prepared by loading the photocatalyst on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass. For photocurrent measurement, a 300 W Xe lamp with a cutoff filter of 420 nm was employed as the visible light source. For electrochemical impedance (Nyquist spectra) measurement, the perturbation signal was 10 mV and the frequency spanned from 100 kHz to 10 mHz.
2.5 Photocatalytic hydrogen production evaluation
Photocatalytic hydrogen production was performed on a CEAULIGHT CEL-SPH2N-S5. In a typical run, 20 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in an aqueous solution (50 mL) containing TEOA (10 vol%) as the sacrificial electron donor. A 300 W Xe lamp with a cutoff filter of 420 nm was employed as the visible light source. The evolved H2 was analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014C, Shimadzu, TCD, argon carrier). For the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) measurement, the light source was adjusted by attaching a series of band-pass filters (400 nm, 420 nm, 450 nm, 500 nm and 550 nm). The number of incident photons was measured using an optical power meter (Aulight NP2000).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and structure analysis of Co3S4–CN
As schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a, the Co3S4–CN junction was prepared via a one-step hydrothermal procedure. Co-ZIF (ZIF-67) was loaded onto g-CN and then converted into Co3S4 by hydrothermal assisted sulfuration using thiourea as a sulfur source. By adjusting the initial input of Co-ZIF, the weight percentage of Co3S4 in the as-obtained composites was regulated (termed as CNCo-X, where X refers to the weight percentage of ZIF-67 in the ZIF/g-CN precursors). The XRD patterns in Fig. 1b indicated that the framework of g-CN was well maintained in CNCo-X while ZIF-67 has been thoroughly converted into Co3S4, especially as demonstrated by the obvious characteristic diffraction peaks of Co3S4 in CNCo-20 and CNCo-50 (Fig. S1a†). As the proportion of Co3S4 in the CNCo-X composites increased, the characteristic diffraction peak of g-CN at 27.8° and the overall crystallinity gradually decreased. A new weak peak at 10.8–10.9° in the XRD patterns (Fig. S1b†) suggested that a local interplanar deformation occurred in g-CN for all the CNCo-X samples after hydrothermal treatment.44 The FT-IR spectra in Fig. S2† further confirmed the solid structure of the tri-s-triazine backbone in both g-CN and CNCo-X samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. S3†) images exhibited the bulk-layer morphology of CNCo-3, which was similar to that observed in g-CN. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images in Fig. 1c–f revealed that Co3S4 nanoparticles (marked with red circles) anchored on the semi-transparent g-CN layers. The well-defined lattice fringes in high resolution TEM (Fig. 1g and h) matched well with the characteristic d-spacing of (311) and (400) facets of Co3S4, confirming the successful construction of the Co3S4–CN heterostructure with intimate contact. The specific surface area of the samples was measured and is illustrated in Fig. S4a.† g-CN exhibited a classical type IV isotherm with an H3 hysteresis loop, indicating slit pores in the multilayer framework. The isotherms for the CNCo-X samples turned out to be type IV isotherms with an H4 hysteresis loop, implying the existence of mesopores. The specific surface area was calculated to be 11.6, 39.7, 45.7, 19.6, and 42.8 m2 g−1 for g-CN, CNCo-1, CNCo-3, CNCo-5 and CNCo-10, respectively. The pore size distribution in Fig. S4b† also confirmed the mesoporous structure in CNCo-X. It should be noted that CNCo-3 possessed the largest specific surface area among all the samples, suggesting that more surface reactive sites were available for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Three control samples (CN-HT, CN-S and ZIF-S) were synthesized and characterized to further explore this synthesis protocol. As expected, in addition to the main diffraction peak of g-CN at 27.8°, a weak peak at 10.9° indicating local structural reconstruction was observed in the XRD patterns of CN-HT and CN-S (Fig. S5a†). The decreased C–H rocking vibration (889 cm−1) and out-of-plane bending of the C–N heterocycle (808 cm−1) for CN-HT and CN-S (Fig. S5b†) also verified the local structural deformation. Moreover, CN-HT and CN-S exhibited slightly decreased band absorption as well as blue-shifted PL emission in Fig. S5c and d.† All these featured findings matched well with early reported studies and further consolidated the local structural reconstruction in hydrothermally treated g-CN. On the other hand, ZIF-S turned out to be Co3S4 crystals as the characteristic diffraction peaks of Co3S4 and Co–S vibration at 619 cm−1 were clearly observed in the corresponding XRD patterns and FT-IR spectra, respectively. In addition, different from the semiconducting g-CN, ZIF-S (i.e. Co3S4) exhibited intense absorption across the UV-visible light region and negligible PL emission owing to its metallic characteristic. The TEM images in Fig. S6† show that CN-HT and CN-S exhibited a similar bulk layer structure to that found in g-CN, suggesting that the structural reorganization was limited. As for ZIF-S, the dodecahedral structure of ZIF-67 was destroyed during the hydrothermal process and the resulting Co3S4 changed into irregular circular particles like that observed in CNCo-X.
In order to investigate the typical interplay between Co3S4 and g-CN, quantum simulation was firstly performed. As illustrated by total density of states (TDOS) plots in Fig. 2a and b, Co3S4 exhibited notable metallicity in contrast to the classical semiconducting g-CN. The work function of the Co3S4 (400) surface and g-CN was theoretically predicted to be 4.357 and 4.568 eV, respectively (Fig. 2c and d). Thereafter, the electrons in metallic Co3S4 would transport to semiconducting g-CN in terms of their Fermi level alignment. It has been reported that when the metal was in contact with the semiconductor, a space charge region with a built-in electric field would be created to maintain equilibrium of the dynamic interface charge transfer.30 Thus, an ohmic junction was supposed to form between g-CN and Co3S4 with the built-in electric field pointing to g-CN. Then, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyze the electronic structure at the Co3S4–CN interface. As shown in Fig. S7a,† both g-CN and CNCo-X showed almost the same layout in the C 1s spectra after calibration, confirming again the well-maintained carbon nitride framework and negligible hydrothermally induced oxygen containing heterogeneity. Meanwhile, the binding energy of C 1s for sp2 CN motifs in CNCo-X exhibited an obvious upshift compared with that of g-CN. For N 1s spectra (Fig. 2e), the pristine g-CN exhibited three peaks at 398.4, 399.5 and 400.6 eV, which represented the nitrogen in the aromatic heterocycle (C–CN), tertiary nitrogen (N–(C)3), and terminal amine group (C–N–H), respectively.45 By contrast, the binding energy of N 1s in CNCo-X displayed a significant shift towards higher energy. On the other hand, compared with Co3S4, the binding energy of Co 2p in CNCo-X exhibited a negative shift towards lower binding energy (Fig. 2f). Meanwhile, the valence band level of g-CN was lowered upon the construction of the Co3S4–CN junction as demonstrated by the valence band-XPS (VBXPS) analysis (Fig. S7b†). The above comparison indicated the occurrence of downward band bending because of the building of an interface electric field.19,30 In accordance with the predicted ohmic contact from the above simulations, the experimental results confirmed that the combination between g-CN and metallic Co3S4 followed the classical metal–semiconductor ohmic contact and caused downward band bending on the surface of g-CN.

3.2 Exciton dissociation and charge separation
To explore the effect of metallic Co3S4 on the excitonic behavior of g-CN, the photophysics of the Co3S4–CN junction was evaluated by a series of spectroscopy techniques. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra in Fig. 3a revealed that the PL emission of CNCo-X was largely quenched compared to g-CN. Given that the photoluminescence has been indicative of radiative decay of singlet excitons in g-CN, the remarkably reduced PL intensity indicated that the population of singlet excitons greatly declined upon building the Co3S4–CN ohmic junction.46 As demonstrated above in Fig. S5c and d,† the decrease of the intrinsic band absorption of g-CN after the hydrothermal process has caused slightly blue shifted PL emission (∼0.02 eV). Notably, the main peak of PL for CNCo-3 showed a notable blue-shift (equal to an energy of 0.18 eV) in a normalized solid-state PL spectrum (inset in Fig. 3a). This phenomenon could be mainly attributed to that the ohmic contact between g-CN and Co3S4 enabled the downward band bending at the g-CN surface, which would increase the energy gap between the conduction band bottom and the bent valence band (schematically illustrated in Fig. S8†). Time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was then employed to gain insight into the exciton decay. As shown in Fig. 3b, compared to pristine g-CN, accelerated exciton depopulation was observed in CNCo-1, -3 and referenced Pt modified g-CN (CNPt-1%). Triple-exponential fitting (Table S1†) indicated that the average exciton lifetime for CNCo-1, CNCo-3, and CNPt-1% was 11.64, 11.76, and 7.30 ns, respectively, much shorter than that of g-CN (14.89 ns). The notable decrease of the singlet exciton lifetime for CNCo-X was clearly indicative of the promoted exciton dissociation across the ohmic junction.47,48

Temperature dependent photo-induced luminescence (TDL) was investigated to evaluate the thermodynamic process for exciton dissociation. Fig. 3c and d insets show representative TDL spectra from 87 K to 337 K with an interval of 10 K for g-CN and CNCo-3, respectively. In addition to signals from prompt fluorescence (PF), remarkable phosphorescence (PH) emission (centered at ∼490 nm) was clearly observed, which came from the significant exciton effect in g-CN.49,50 Considering that the PH emission in g-CN is essentially P-type delayed fluorescence derived from the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) process,46,49,50 the remarkably reduced (more than an order of magnitude) PH intensity of CNCo-3 presented in Fig. S9† undoubtedly suggested a suppressed exciton effect in CNCo-3. The exciton binding energy Eb was estimated by fitting of temperature dependent PL or PH emission in analogy with the Arrhenius equation (KB is the Boltzmann constant, 8.617 × 10−5 eV):51 IT = I0/(1 + Aexp(−Eb/KBT))(1)

Fig. 3c and d exhibit the normalized intensity of PL emission as a function of temperature for g-CN and CNCo-3, respectively, while the case of PH emission is illustrated in Fig. S10a and b.† The strong correlation between the emission intensity IT and T−1 was well fitted by a logistic function and is summarized in Table S2.† The binding energy of singlet and triplet excitons was estimated to be 93.41 and 93.27 meV for g-CN, respectively, while the value turned out to be 76.80 and 50.18 meV for CNCo-3. The decreased exciton binding energy implied that the excitons generated in CNCo-3 were readily dissociated into free charges rather than being bound together. On the basis of the above thermodynamic and kinetic analysis, it could be concluded that the introduction of Co3S4 remarkably weakened the exciton effect and promoted exciton splitting efficiency in g-CN.
In view of the promoted exciton dissociation across the Co3S4–CN junction, the transport and separation of the dissociated electrons and holes were investigated. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) in the dark state (Fig. S11†) revealed that the introduction of metallic Co3S4 could enhance the intrinsic conductivity of the composites. However, it was noted that the conductivity of CNCo-5 was comparable with that of CNCo-1 and lower than that of CNCo-3. We reasoned that the shrinking of the surface area for CNCo-5 might account for the decrease of conductivity. Fig. 3e illustrates the EIS of g-CN and CNCo-X under visible light irradiation. Compared with g-CN, a significantly enhanced electron photoconductivity was inferred from the small radius of CNCo-X. The comparison indicated that the superior photoconductivity of CNCo-X did not arise from the direct contribution of highly conductive Co3S4 but rather the synergistic effect of efficient exciton dissociation and charge separation. The enhanced charge separation achieved with Co3S4–CN was confirmed by the steady-state photocurrent response (Fig. 3f), where the photocurrent of CNCo-X reached more than 10 times higher than that of pristine g-CN. It was noted that the loading amount of Co3S4 had a significant effect on the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, in which CNCo-3 exhibited the optimal performance in terms of PL, EIS and photocurrent. This might be because excess Co3S4 NPs would inversely serve as recombination centers for electrons and holes. Moreover, due to the light absorption properties of Co3S4, high Co3S4 loading (>3%) on the surface of g-CN might block the intrinsic light absorption of the g-CN photosensitizer (see the discussion in UV-vis absorption).
3.3 Charge separation mechanism
In order to uncover the underlying mechanism of charge separation at the Co3S4–CN interface, the dynamic population of photo-excited charges was investigated by in situ characterization. Fig. 4a displays a representative atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of CNCo-3, in which Co3S4 NPs were clearly anchored on the surface of g-CN. The height profile in Fig. 4b revealed the nanoscale dimension (∼6 nm) of Co3S4 and marked out the contact interface. The surface potential at Co3S4–CN was measured by spatially resolved Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to monitor the interface contact barrier.52 In the dark state, the contact potential difference (CPD, Fig. 4c) at the Co3S4–CN interface was much higher than that of the g-CN domain, reflecting the lower work function at the interface and downward band bending in g-CN.19,53 Upon light irradiation, the CPD at the contact interface was greatly weakened because of the electron injection from the photo-excited g-CN to the Co3S4 domain (Fig. 4d). Moreover, the spatially resolved surface photovoltage (SRSPV) provided a visualization landscape of interface charge separation, which was obtained by subtracting the CPD signal in the dark state from that under light irradiation. The SRSPV spectra (Fig. 4e–h and S12†) collected at different cross-lines all exhibited notable negative signals at the contact interface (the region marked in pink), symbolizing the accumulation of free electrons as a result of efficient charge separation.52,54,55 The intriguing result manifested that owing to the presence of the Co3S4–CN junction interface, the excitons generated in g-CN would undergo ultrafast dissociation followed by efficient charge separation via electron transfer from the g-CN bulk to the interface. A photodeposition experiment was carried out to track the transport of separated charges with Pt4+ (in the form of chloroplatinic acid hydrate) and Mn2+ (in the form of manganese chloride) as the acceptors for electrons and holes, respectively.56 As illustrated in Fig. 4i, the main compositions of C, N, S, and Co elements are clearly presented in CNCo-3. The deposited Pt (Fig. 4i and S13a†) particles were found indiscriminately at both g-CN and Co3S4 sites. In contrast, the Mn-related signals (Fig. 4i and S13b†) were exclusively undetected at the Co3S4 domains. Pt and Mn represented the positions to which electrons and holes migrate, respectively. The above observation implied that the holes were predominately confined in g-CN while the electrons were extracted and transferred to Co3S4.56,57 In this sense, the Co3S4–CN junction not only facilitated spatial separation of electrons and holes, but also provided an efficient interface for electron extraction.

Density functional theory (DFT) simulations were utilized to uncover the underlying driving force for interface charge separation. Fig. 5a shows the optimized model structure of Co3S4–CN linked through the Co–N bond. From the TDOS of the Co3S4–CN heterostructure in Fig. 5b, the metallic feature of Co3S4 and the band structure of semiconducting g-CN were well preserved. The charge density difference (CDD) in Fig. 5c together with the planar-averaged electron density difference (Fig. 5d) clearly indicated charge redistribution at the contact interface where the electrons in low work function Co3S4 gradually migrated to the g-CN side.58 The theoretical prediction of charge transfer at the interface was consistent with the experimental results, which suggested the formation of ohmic contact between Co3S4 and g-CN. As such, the band energy landscape of the Co3S4–CN ohmic junction was deduced and is presented in Fig. 5e–g. Before the metallic Co3S4 came into contact with g-CN, the relatively higher Fermi level of Co3S4 strongly suggested the potential formation of an ohmic contact with n-type semiconductor g-CN (Fig. 5e). When the two materials were in intimate contact, the difference in Fermi levels could drive the electron transfer from Co3S4 to g-CN, thus creating a built-in electric field (Ebuilt-in) across the space charge region (Fig. 5f). More importantly, the presence of the electric field would enable the energy bands of g-CN to bend downward at the interface. Thus, the energy offset would be introduced to the band structure, favorable for exciton dissociation and charge separation. When g-CN was photo-excited (Fig. 5g), the singlet excitons generated in g-CN were readily dissociated into free charges with the electrons drifting to Co3S4 for on-going reactions while the holes were mainly blocked back in the g-CN bulk. As a result, the exciton dissociation and spatial separation of separated carriers have been synchronously completed.

3.4 Optoelectronic and photocatalytic properties
The semiconducting properties were evaluated to fulfill the potential of CNCo-X as an efficient photocatalyst for solar fuel production. The absorption spectra in Fig. 6a indicated that metallic Co3S4 significantly improved the overall light absorption even though the intrinsic band gap of g-CN increased slightly during the hydrothermal process (Fig. S5c†). Consistent with the enhanced light absorption, the band gap deduced from the Tauc plot (Fig. S14a†) was found to gradually decrease from 2.79 to 2.76, 2.64, 2.61, and 2.41 eV for g-CN, CNCo-1, CNCo-3, CNCo-5, and CNCo-10, respectively. It was deduced from Fig. 6a that the intrinsic semiconducting response gradually decreased with increasing Co3S4 loading. This might be because Co3S4 NPs at the surface would shield the incident light and thus block the penetration of photons. This finding also partially explained the dependence of photoelectrical performance on the Co3S4 loading amount for CNCo-X. The flat band level (quasi Fermi level) was then estimated by Mott–Schottky measurement. As illustrated in Fig. 6b, Co3S4 exhibited an ambipolar response, which was in good accordance with its metallic nature. Compared to the pristine g-CN, the flat band for CNCo-X shifted to a higher level (Fig. S14b†), mainly resulting from the electron injection from Co3S4. As a rule of thumb, the conduction band of the n-type semiconductor is ∼0.2 V more negative than that of the flat band.59,60 Therefore, the conduction bands of g-CN and CNCo-3 were presumed to be −0.65 and −0.87 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively, much higher than the theoretical redox potential of proton reduction (−0.41 V vs. NHE at pH 6.8).61 By using the optical band gap from the Tauc plot, the valence bands of g-CN and CNCo-3 were calculated to be 2.14 and 1.77 eV. This result was in good accordance with that deduced from VB-XPS (2.01 and 1.75 eV for g-CN and CNCo-3).

The photocatalytic activity of the as-obtained materials for visible light driven hydrogen production was tested. Not surprisingly, owing to the severe excitonic effect, the hydrogen production rate in pristine g-CN was greatly limited (∼0.2 μmol g−1 h−1, Fig. 6c). In stark contrast, significantly enhanced hydrogen production was achieved in CNCo-X owing to the efficient charge regulation (exciton dissociation and charge separation) as well as promoted reaction kinetics deduced from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV, Fig. S15†). The photocatalytic performance of CNCo-1 (148.2 μmol g−1 h−1) was comparable to that of Pt modified g-CN (154.7 μmol g−1 h−1), suggesting the superior availability of Co3S4 as an alternative to the noble metal cocatalyst. Among the different CNCo-X samples, CNCo-3 exhibited the highest hydrogen production rate (∼217.0 μmol g−1 h−1, Fig. 6c), more than three orders of magnitude larger than that of unmodified g-CN. Moreover, as illustrated in Table S3,† this value was also among those at the top compared with the latest reported g-CN modified with a metal-based cocatalyst (e.g. Co(dcbpy), FeP, In2O3, or carbon nanotubes).62–66Fig. 6d shows the wavelength dependent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) profile of CNCo-3. The changing tendency of AQE was consistent with that of the absorption spectrum, indicating that the hydrogen production was indeed a photocatalysis process. The highest AQE was obtained at 400 nm (∼13.1%), at which the maximum absorption peak was exactly located. Moreover, the photocatalyst exhibited AQE up to 0.6% in the green region. To exclude the potential effect of protonation or exfoliation of g-CN during hydrothermal treatment, the photocatalytic performance of the control samples was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 6e, the photocatalytic hydrogen production of the pristine g-CN and all three control samples (i.e. CN-HT, CN-S and ZIF-S) was very limited (0.16–0.46 μmol g−1 h−1) without loading noble metal Pt as a cocatalyst. Moreover, CN-HT exhibited a similar hydrogen production rate to that of pristine g-CN when loading Pt. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic activities of g-CN–1% Pt and CN-HT–1% Pt were higher than that of Pt modified CN-DCDA, comparable with that of CNCo-1 and less than that of CNCo-3 (Fig. S16†). This finding indicated that the effect of hydrothermal treatment and related local structural reorganization on the photocatalytic activity was negligible. In this regard, the ohmic junction between metallic Co3S4 and g-CN was of critical importance towards boosting photocatalytic performance. Fig. 6f shows the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution behavior with CNCo-3 as a catalyst for four-cycle runs. CNCo-3 displayed consecutive hydrogen production in each photocatalytic cycle without a notable decrease in photocatalytic activity. The FT-IR spectra, XRD patterns and TEM image in Fig. S17† further confirmed the well-maintained robust framework of CNCo-3 after the photocatalysis process.
With this result, together with the exciton dissociation and charge separation mechanism, we proposed the photocatalytic process of CNCo-3: the photosensitizer g-CN was firstly photo-excited upon absorbing photons to generate bound electron–hole pairs (i.e. excitons). These excitons were then dissociated into free charges across the Co3S4–CN interface owing to the presence of an interfacial electric field and downward band bending. As a result, the electrons were extracted from the g-CN bulk to the Co3S4 side while the holes were mainly blocked back in g-CN motifs. At last, the porous structure as well as the intrinsic reactive sites in CNCo-3 provided a large number of available surface sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction.
3.5 NiS2–CN heterostructure
To validate the generality of this interface charge modulation of MTMSs, the NiS2–CN heterostructure (CNNi-X) was also synthesized from Ni-MOF and g-CN (see synthesis details in the Experimental section). Similar to Co3S4, NiS2 presented an obvious metallic characteristic with a calculated work function of 3.847 eV (Fig. S18†). The XRD pattern (Fig. S19a†) and TEM images (Fig. 7a) illustrated that NiS2 NPs with the (200) facet were clearly anchored on g-CN.67,68 Compared to pristine g-CN, the binding energy of C and N species for CNNi-5 shifted to a higher energy (Fig. S19b† and 7b), which suggested the downward band bending at the g-CN surface. The formation of ohmic contact greatly promoted the exciton dissociation and charge separation efficiency in g-CN as indicated by a faster TRPL decay (Fig. 7c) and quenched PL emission (Fig. 7d). As such, the photocurrent response of CNNi-5 was greatly enhanced compared to g-CN (Fig. 7e), which implied that more free charges were generated upon building the NiS2–CN junction. Benefiting from the enhanced light response (Fig. S20†) as well as promoted exciton dissociation and charge separation mentioned above, a significant improvement in photocatalytic hydrogen production has been realized with CNNi-X (Fig. 7f). The highest H2 evolution was observed in CNNi-5 with an average rate of 536.90 μmol g−1 h−1. The wavelength dependent AQE (Fig. S21†) was in line with the absorption spectrum with the maximum reaching up to 7.55% at a wavelength of 400 nm. NiS2–CN along with Co3S4–CN solidly suggested the crucial role of MTMSs in the construction of an ohmic junction and for regulating charge separation in the semiconducting photocatalyst.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we developed an efficient photocatalytic system based on an ohmic junction by in situ loading MOF derived metallic Co3S4 on the semiconducting g-CN. The energy offset in the Fermi level enabled interface electron transport between Co3S4 and g-CN, which induced a built-in electric field and bent the bands downward at the semiconductor surface. The construction of the Co3S4–CN junction facilitated exciton dissociation and promoted charge transport and surface charge separation. Compared with g-CN, three orders of magnitude enhancement was achieved in visible light driven photocatalytic hydrogen production with the CNCo-3 catalyst. In addition, the methodology provided a versatile platform for regulating interface charge separation through the use of other metallic sulfides, such as NiS2–CN. This work not only demonstrates an efficient metallic sulfide–carbon nitride based photocatalyst for hydrogen production, but also uncovers the fundamental mechanism of metallic sulfide mediated interfacial charge modulation.
