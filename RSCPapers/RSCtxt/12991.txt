    , Accepted 22nd October 2021First published on 25th October 2021AbstractIntroducing a third component into bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) has become an effective strategy to improve device efficiency. However, it is difficult to obtain ternary fullerene OSCs that simultaneously exhibit high device efficiency and stability. In this work, a small-molecule donor (TiC8) with a thieno[3,2-c]isochromene unit was primarily reported as a third component to construct cascade ternary fullerene OSCs based on a typical low-cost PTB7-Th:PC71BM host matrix. The effect of TiC8 on the active-layer morphology, device efficiency and stability was deeply studied. It is found that introducing the third component TiC8 is effective in accurately regulating the active-layer morphology and improving the device performance of the ternary OSCs based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM host matrix. Furthermore, an increased power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.12% was obtained in this type of ternary fullerene OSC, which is significantly higher than those values in the corresponding binary fullerene OSCs with PTB7-Th:PC71BM (9.16%) or TiC8:PC71BM (4.53%) systems. More importantly, the device stability of the ternary fullerene OSCs was dramatically improved at the same time. The PCE value was maintained at the 80% level after 4752 h (156 days) at room temperature and 80.2% level after 432 h at 100 °C relative to the initial PCE for the ternary fullerene OSCs in a N2-filled glovebox. Our work indicates that small-molecule donor TiC8 with a thieno[3,2-c]isochromene unit is a promising third component to enhance the device performance with high PCE and outstanding device stability for ternary fullerene OSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are a promising next-generation photovoltaic technology owing to their great advantages of light weight, flexibility, translucency, and roll-to-roll processing.1–4 In recent years, benefitting from the development of electron donors and acceptors, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has been significantly increased.5–7 Despite the fact that the PCEs of binary OSCs based on fullerene acceptors and non-fullerene acceptors have respectively exceeded 11% (ref. 8–10) and 18%,11 there remains a great challenge in terms of efficiency, stability and cost in order to meet the requirements of commercial application. In bulk-heterojunction OSCs, the active layer is currently composed of two components: an electron donor and acceptor.12,13 However, the absorption spectra of the active layer often overlap only partially with the solar irradiation spectrum. It seriously affects the highly efficient utility of solar energy for the active layer. Two strategies were mainly utilized to address this issue. Firstly, two or more sub-cells with different absorption ranges are employed in series or parallel to fabricate tandem OSCs.14,15 Secondly, a third component is employed to construct the so-called ternary OSCs, which can extend the absorption range of the binary active layer.16–20 But there appears to be some new trouble for both strategies. The tandem OSCs require a connection layer for the sub-cells, for which it is difficult to find suitable orthogonal solvents. Furthermore, since the device structure is quite complex, the fabrication cost is undoubtedly increased.21,22
To the best of our knowledge, only a few ternary OSCs have been successfully developed with high performance, because the absorption, energy level and compatibility in a ternary system are hard to modulate at the same time, which seriously affects photon trapping, exciton dissociation and morphology regulation of the active layer.23,24 Recently, some theoretical models have been established to guide the performance improvement of ternary devices,25 such as charge transfer model,26 energy transfer model,27 parallel-like model,28 and alloy-like mode.29 Device efficiency has been increased to 12% for ternary fullerene OSCs.30 However, satisfactory device stability has not been achieved.
At present, most studies focus primarily on the photovoltaic performance, but ignore the device stability in this field, which is an important consideration for their commercialization. In general, the device stability is mainly governed by the photoactive layer. Several possible origins can decrease device stability, including exposure to humidity, photo-oxidation of the active layer and morphological instability due to materials aggregation under thermal stress.31–33 In order to improve device stability, some strategies have been developed, such as employing chemically stable donor and acceptor materials, adopting a ternary component, adding an additive, employing an inverted device structure, improving the buffer layer, and using stable electrodes and encapsulation technologies. But there are only a few successful cases where high device stability was realized. Therefore, achieving high device stability remains a great challenge.
The PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend is a classic and primary host matrix with low cost in the reported ternary OSCs.34 Upon adding a third component, such as a small molecule (SM) with strong crystallinity, the resulting ternary OSCs based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM host matrix obtained fine-tunable miscibility and complementary absorption, further exhibiting an increasing device efficiency.35 For instance, Yang et al. reported a benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′] dithiophene-based SM and the corresponding ternary OSCs exhibited an efficiency as high as 12.1%, but device stability was not realized.30 Tao et al. reported a SM based on a diphenylimidazole derivative (PTN) and the corresponding ternary OSCs exhibited an efficiency of 11.4% and a short stability duration of 55 days during air storage.36 It seems difficult to obtain high-performance ternary fullerene OSCs with satisfactory PCE and device stability at the same time.
In our previous work, a wide-bandgap SM of (IDO-TiC-T)2-DFBT with a thieno[3,2-c] isochromene (TiC) was synthesized and primarily used as a donor to obtain excellent binary fullerene37 and ternary non-fullerene OSCs.38 Considering that the TiC-type SM has high crystallinity and its frontier molecular orbital energy levels locate in the middle between PTB7-Th and PC71BM, in this work, a wide-bandgap analogue TiC8 with an octyl group was used as the third component to primarily construct ternary fullerene OSCs based on the low-cost PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary host matrix. Fig. 1 shows the chemical structures, absorptions and energy levels of PTB7-Th, TiC8 and PC71BM, as well as the device structure. The effect of TiC8 on the absorption and morphology of the active layer, as well as the photovoltaic properties and device stability of the ternary fullerene OSCs, was primarily studied and discussed. Our results show that TiC8 is an efficient third component to achieve high-performance ternary fullerene OSCs with high PCE and device stability.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Optical and electrochemical properties
The normalized absorption spectra of the PTB7-Th, TiC8, and PC71BM neat films are shown in Fig. 1b. It is found that PC71BM and PTB7-Th have strong absorption in the range of 300–600 and 500–800 nm, respectively. And TiC8 exhibits a strong absorption from 400 to 700 nm. Obviously, there is good absorption complementarity for the three molecules from 300 nm to 800 nm, which is beneficial to obtain high photon-response ability for the resulting ternary system. Fig. 1c depicts the absorption spectra of the blend films of PTB7-Th:PC71BM, TiC8:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM, respectively. More enhanced absorption is observed in the absorption spectrum for the optimal ternary blend film of PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM than the binary blend films of PTB7-Th:PC71BM and TiC8:PC71BM. It indicates that the three molecules have a good intermolecular effect on the ternary blend film.39 Adding TiC8 into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary system can increase the absorption coefficient for the resulting ternary system.
The electrochemical properties of TiC8 and PTB7-Th were determined by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. The oxidation potentials of TiC8 and PTB7-Th were measured to be 1.18 eV and 0.96 eV, respectively. As the ferrocene potential is 0.50 eV vs. a Ag/AgCl electrode, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of TiC8 and PTB7-Th are calculated to be −5.49 eV and −5.27 eV from an empirical formula.40 Thus the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were further calculated according to the optical band gap. Fig. 1d shows their corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The cascade alignments of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are respectively observed among PTB7-Th, TiC8 and PC71BM, which can provide an efficient pathway for hole and electron transfer.25 Moreover, the large and same LUMO energy level offset is also observed between donor TiC8 or PTB7-Th and acceptor PC71BM, which can provide sufficient driving force for exciton dissociation in the ternary system.
2.2. Photovoltaic properties
Ternary OSCs were fabricated with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. And the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. It is observed that the ternary OSCs with the PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM blend exhibit better device performance than the binary OSCs with the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend or TiC8:PC71BM blend. In the optimal binary OSCs, a maximum PCE of 9.39% was obtained in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM based cells with a decreased Voc of 0.789 V. And an increased Voc of 0.918 V, but a decreased PCE of 4.85% was found in the optimal TiC8:PC71BM based cells. However, for the ternary OSCs of PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM, a significantly increased PCE of 11.12% was obtained with a constant Voc of 0.789 V. Thus, the addition of TiC8 has a positive effect on the improvement of photovoltaic performance. The optimal component ratio of the PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM blend is 0.8:0.2:1.5 by weight.

Table 1 summarizes the performance parameters of the optimal binary and ternary cells. The optimal ternary system not only exhibits a higher PCE, but also shows increased Jsc and FF (Jsc from 17.31 to 19.42 mA cm−2 and FF from 0.688 to 0.721). More interestingly, the ternary cells exhibit almost unchanging Voc values with addition of TiC8 from 15.0 wt% to 25.0 wt%, which are similar to those of the binary cells based on PBT7-Th:PC71BM. It indicates that the ternary system presents a cascade model.24Fig. 2b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of binary and ternary cells. EQE as high as 80% is obtained in the ternary cells based on the PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM blend, which is much higher than those in the binary cells based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM or TiC8: PC71BM blend. Therefore, adding the third component of TiC8 into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM host matrix can help the ternary cells to obtain higher photo-response efficiency. Fig. S1† depicts the EQE curve of the ternary devices at adding ratios of TiC8 from 15 wt% to 25 wt%. The optimal adding ratio of TiC8 is 20 wt%. Therefore, the adding ratio of the third component TiC8 is crucial for ternary cells to achieve high photo-response efficiency.
2.3. Charge generation and transport, and energy transport dynamics
The photoluminescence (PL) properties of photoactive materials are an important parameter for investigating the working mechanism of the active layer, including charge transfer and energy transfer.41 Hence, the steady-state PL spectra of the single neat films, the binary blend films, and the ternary blend films were measured for PTB7-Th, TiC8 and PC71BM. Fig. 3a depicts the PL spectra of the films of PTB7-Th, PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7Th:TiC8:PC71BM under photoexcitation at 630 nm. It is observed that the PL quenching efficiencies of the binary PTB7-Th:PC71BM and the ternary PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM blend films are 94.3% and 97.9%, respectively. It indicates that adding the third component of TIC8 can further promote electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor in the ternary system. In comparison with Fig. 1b and 3b, we find that there is an apparent overlap between the PL spectrum of the TiC8 neat film and the absorption spectrum of the PTB7-Th neat film. Thus, we further measured the PL spectra of the films of TiC8, PTB7-Th and PTB7-Th:TiC8 (1:1) under photoexcitation at 540 nm, shown in Fig. 3b, in order to unveil the energy transfer between PTB7-Th and TiC8. It is found that, in the PTB7-Th:TiC8 blend films, the PL intensity of PTB7-Th is significantly enhanced and that of TiC8 is obviously weakened. Therefore, energy transfer, that is, the so-called rapid fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), should occur from TiC8 to PTB7-Th, which has been considered as an effective strategy to obtain high-efficiency ternary OSCs.19

(c) Current density–voltage characteristics of the optimal binary and ternary OSCs in the dark. (d) The Jphversus Veff curves of the cells based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM, TiC8:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM (0.8:0.2:1.5). 
The J–V characteristics for the optimal PTB7-Th:PC71BM, TiC8:PC71BM, and PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM based OSCs in the dark are shown in Fig. 3c. A low reverse bias current (leakage current) is observed in these optimal OSCs. The current rectification ratio is defined as the ratio of the current at 2 V to the current at −2 V based on the dark J–V curves. The leakage current in OSCs is undesirable current that is injected from the electrodes prior to turn-on voltage that results in lower FF and Jsc values. A large rectification ratio and low dark current at reverse bias are observed in the optimal PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM ternary devices, indicating that the photoactive layer with the addition of TiC8 would suppress the defects and drastically reduce the shunt resistance effects.
To understand the exciton dissociation of the binary and ternary cells in depth, the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective applied voltage (Veff) was measured and is shown in Fig. 3d. As is well known, Jph is defined as JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the current density under illumination and in the dark, respectively. And Veff is defined as V0 − Va, where V0 refers to the voltage at which Jph = 0 and Va is the applied bias.42 It is found that the Veff value at saturation current density (defined as Jsat) is 3.05 V for the PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM-based ternary OSCs, which is much lower than those for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM- and TiC8:PC71BM-based binary OSCs. All optical excitons are suggested to be dissociated and collected by their respective electrodes in the Jsat state as Jsat is only related to absorbed photon quantities. Hence, there is better exciton dissociation in the PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM cells. As charge dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) can be estimated by Jph/Jsat under short-circuit conditions, the ηdiss values are further calculated for the optimal devices of PTB7-Th:PC71BM, PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM, and TiC8:PC71BM, which are 95.43%, 97.20%, and 83.03%, respectively. It implies that adding the third component of TiC8 into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system can effectively promote charge dissociation in active layers.43
The space charge-limited current (SCLC) method was used to measure the hole and electron mobility (μh and μe) of the optimal active layers in the hole-only device with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and electron-only device with a structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al, respectively. As shown in Fig. S2a and b,† the μh and μe values of the optimal ternary active layer are calculated to be 6.13 × 10−4 and 9.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μh and μe values here are significantly increased in comparison with those values from the optimal binary active layers based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM (5.46 × 10−4 and 5.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and TiC8:PC71BM (1.93 × 10−4 and 2.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Therefore, adding the third component of TiC8 into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system improves the charge transport capacity of the resulting ternary system.
2.4. Film morphology and miscibility
It is well known that the morphology of the active layer has a tremendous effect on the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding OSCs, especially in a ternary blend system.44 To gain insight into the reason for the better performance of ternary cells, the surface morphologies and molecular orientation of the optimal binary and ternary blend films were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS),45 respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a–f, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film is 1.49 nm. When the third component of TiC8 is added into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system with increasing ratios from 5 wt% to 25 wt%, the resulting ternary blend films of PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM exhibit various morphologies with different RMS roughnesses. At a TiC8 ratio of 20 wt%, the ternary blend film exhibits the smallest RMS roughness of 1.38 nm and better morphology. However, at a TiC8 ratio of 25 wt%, the ternary blend film exhibits a worse morphology with increasing RMS roughness of 3.38 nm. The variation in morphology of ternary blend films is suggested to be related to the strong crystallinity of TiC8 and its adding ratios.
 Fig. 4  AFM height images (a)–(f), TEM images (g)–(i) and the in-plane (j) and out-of-plane (k) 2D-GIWAXS scattering patterns for the binary blend films of PTB7-Th:PC71BM and TiC8:PC71BM, and ternary blend film of PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM. 
Here, the smallest RMS roughness and nearly ideal nanoscale phase separation for the optimal PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM blend film (0.8:0.2:1.5) facilitate exciton dissociation and charge transport, resulting in significantly improved Jsc and FF.46 The recorded TEM images, shown in Fig. 4g–i, further support this view. From the unobvious fibrous structures of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary blend film to the subtle fibrous structures of the optimal ternary blend film, and finally to the larger fibrous structures of binary blend TiC8:PC71BM film, the evolution of TEM images proves that the morphologies with better phase separation size can be tuned for the ternary blend film by optimizing the adding ratio of TiC8. The improved morphology of the photovoltaic layer enhances the stability of the cells.

Fig. 4j and k show the in-plane and out-of-plane 2D-GIWAXS scattering patterns of the active layers in binary and ternary OSCs.45 An obvious diffraction peak (100) at qxy = 0.29 Å−1 and 0.30 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction is observed for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM blend films, respectively. The corresponding lamellar stacking distance and crystallite coherence lengths (CCLs) are 21.51/68.93 Å for the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film and 21.07/76.38 Å for the PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM blend film. It indicates that the ternary blend film exhibits a slightly enhanced lamellar stacking in comparison with the binary blend film. It is noted that an obvious diffraction peak (010) at qz = 1.77 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction is only observed in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film, whose π–π distance and crystallite coherent length (CCL) are calculated to be 3.54 Å and 28.40 Å, respectively. It indicates that the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film preferentially adopts a face-on orientation relative to the substrate. However, the (010) diffraction peak almost disappeared in both the IP and OOP directions for the ternary blend film using TiC8 as the third component. It implies that the ternary blend film exhibits a significantly reduced π–π accumulation, possibly due to the effect of the edge-on stacking pattern of TiC8. Hence, incorporation of TiC8 into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film can effectively regulate the phase separation size and optimize the active layer morphology.
The compatibility among different components has an important effect on the morphology of the photoactive layer in the ternary OSCs. Hence, the contact angles of water (polar liquid) and diiodomethane (nonpolar liquid) were measured on the surface of the PTB7-Th, TiC8, PC71BM, and PTB7-Th:TiC8 films, as shown in Fig. 5. According to the formula of the two-liquid method, their surface energies are calculated to be 35.50, 41.38, 34.29 and 34.17 mN m−1, respectively.39 In comparison with these surface energies, it is suggested that PC71BM has good compatibility with PTB7-Th and poor compatibility with TiC8. In contrast, PC71BM has good compatibility with the optimal PTB7-Th:TiC8 blend film owing to their similar surface energies. It indicates that the optimal PTB7-Th:TiC8 blend film exhibits a synergetic compatibility with PC71BM upon increasing the TiC8 ratio. The improved compatibility of the PTB7-Th:TiC8 blend with PC71BM further improves device stability.

2.5. Stability analysis
Stability is a critical parameter for assessing the application potential of OSCs. Here, the temporal stability and thermal stability of these OSCs were comparatively studied. As revealed in Fig. 6a, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary cells exhibit temporal instability. With the extension of time, the PCE value of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM cells decreases sharply. After 68 h, the transient PCE value decreases to 65.5% of the initial PCE value under a N2 atmosphere. However, the PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM cells exhibit excellent time stability. The transient PCE value still maintains 80% of the initial PCE value after 4752 h (156 days). On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6b, the binary PTB7-Th:PC71BM cells further present thermal instability, where the PCE value sharply decreases to 50.7% of the initial PCE value at 100 °C for about 0.5 h under a N2 atmosphere in a glovebox. Nevertheless, at 100 °C for 432 h, the ternary PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM cells still maintain 80.2% of the initial PCE value. Therefore, adding the third component of TiC8 into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system can significantly improve the temporal stability and thermal stability of the resulting PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM cells.
 Fig. 6  (a) Time stability and (b) thermal stability of devices based on PTB7-Th:PC71BM, TiC8:PC71BM and PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM. 
In order to understand the reason behind device stability, we measured the 1HNMR spectra of the TiC8:PC71BM blend and its single components in CDCl3, which are shown in Fig. S3.† By comparing Fig. S3a–c,† it is found that the chemical shift of H of TiC8 is shifted from δ = 8.19 ppm in single TiC8 to δ = 8.23 ppm in the TiC8:PC71BM blend. Furthermore, two resonance signals of H/H cross-peaks are observed at 8.23 and 7.39 ppm between TiC8 and PC71BM in the 2D 1HNMR spectrum of the TiC8:PC71BM blend, as shown in Fig. S3d.† It implies that hydrogen bonds are indeed formed between TiC8 and PC71BM. The resulting hydrogen bond is consistent with the reduced electron cloud density and the increased chemical shift for the C–H bond in the TiC8:PC71BM blend. Here, the resulting hydrogen bond should enhance device stability.
To further understand the stability behavior, the evolution of their microstructure was investigated using AFM and TEM measurements. For the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film, the RMS roughness obviously increased after heating at 100 °C for 24 h (Fig. S4m†). But for the blend film of TiC8:PC71BM the time required is 72 h (Fig. S4g†). It further indicates that the TiC8:PC71BM-based OSCs exhibit a better thermal stability than the PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based OSCs, which may be due to the poor stability of PTB7-Th with a quinone structure. Surprisingly, the RMS roughness of the PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM ternary blend film hardly changed after 360 h heating at 100 °C (Fig. S4d†) and increased slightly after 648 h (from 1.41 nm to 1.53 nm), indicating that the ternary blend membrane has excellent thermal stability.
A similar phenomenon was found in TEM tests, and as shown in Fig. S5,† a lot of black regions (aggregated states of fullerenes) appeared when the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film was heated at 100 °C for 48 h (Fig. S5m†). And the fibrous nanoscale structure of the TiC8:PC71BM blend film did not disappear until after heating for 168 h at 100 °C (Fig. S5i†), indicating superior thermal stability compared to that of PTB7-Th:PC71BM. However, a little black fullerene aggregation domain appeared until 360 h (Fig. S5e†) when the ternary blend film of PTB7-Th:TiC8:PC71BM was treated at 100 °C. It may be due to the fact that TiC8 can induce the system to produce a microcrystalline phase, which improves the thermal stability. These results confirm that the addition of TiC8 into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend can effectively improve the thermal stability of the resulting device.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, a type of ternary fullerene OSC with high efficiency and stability was successfully developed by introducing the third component of TiC8 into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM binary system. The effect of the TiC8 adding ratio on the morphology of the active layer, device efficiency and stability of the ternary fullerene OSCs was clearly revealed. A high PCE of 11.12% was achieved in the optimal ternary fullerene OSCs. Furthermore, the transient PCE value was still maintained at the 80% level after 4752 h at room temperature and 80.2% level after 432 h at 100 °C relative to the initial PCE in a N2-filled glovebox. A high PCE value and record device stability were simultaneously achieved by adding TiC8 into the ternary fullerene OSCs with the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend. Our results demonstrated that using TiC8 as the third component is an effective method to improve the PCE and stability of the ternary fullerene OSCs.
