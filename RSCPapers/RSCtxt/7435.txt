    , Accepted 21st November 2006First published on 11th December 2006AbstractCasting a photopolymer solution to form a film, followed by image-wise photoirradiation and subsequent wet development, leads to photolithography. Whereas the wet development is achievable with aqueous alkali, the emission of an organic solvent as a volatile organic compound (VOC) is usually inevitable during the film casting because ingredients of common photopolymers are insoluble in water. This work proposes water-borne photopolymers cast and developed solely with neutral water by incorporating mechanically milled sub-micron particles of poorly water-soluble photoacid generators (PAGs), which undergo direct and sensitised solid-state photolysis to make a poly(vinyl alcohol) film insoluble in water with the aid of acid-sensitive crosslinkers. The sensitised solid-state photolysis of onium-type PAGs in the solid state was studied in detail to extend the spectral sensitivity of this kind of photopolymer. Fluorescence quenching measurements revealed that the solid-state sensitisation occurs through singlet exciton migration in sensitiser particles followed by electron transfer to PAG particles at the solid–solid boundary region. Three-component photopolymers comprised of an aqueous dispersion of PAG in the absence or in the presence of a co-milled sensitiser, poly(vinyl alcohol) and a water-soluble diepoxy were formulated to display photosensitivity of 17 mJ cm−2 by the direct photolysis of a dispersed sulfonium salt and that of ca. 120 mJ cm−2, for instance, by the photolysis of an iodonium salt sensitised with co-milled 9,10-dipropoxyanthracene.
Introduction
Photolithographic processes consist of spreading a photopolymer solution to fabricate a thin film on a substrate, followed by image-wise exposure and wet development to remove unexposed or exposed areas selectively to give negative-type or positive-type relief patterns. Photolithography without using any organic solvent has been urgently desirable to carry out non-VOC (volatile organic compound) processes not only for large-scale production of micron-scale relief images applicable to dry film resists, solder resists, photopolymers for printing plates and so forth,1 but also for sub-micron or nano-patterning in semiconductor industries.2 But there have been only a few photopolymers processed solely with neutral water as a safe and readily available solvent. Except for classical water-developable photopolymers crosslinked by means of dichromate salts, diazo resins and water-soluble diazides, commercially available water-developable photopolymers are poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) substituted with photodimerisable styrylpyridinium side chains in anomalously low loadings.1,3 They have been used not only for making printing plates and the other photolithographic applications, but also for immobilizing bioactive substances including enzymes, microbial cells and so forth.1 The other photocrosslinkable polymers cast and developed with water have been prepared by tethering aromatic azide moieties to water-soluble polymers to improve photosensitivity.4 These types of photopolymers become water-insoluble solely photochemically. Accordingly, a level of crosslinking density is specifically determined by loading of photosensitive moieties, leading sometimes to problems arising from swelling of crosslinked films in water. On the other hand, chemistries for widely spread photopolymers including the following two types involve not only photochemical events, but also subsequent thermal reactions. The first is predominantly based on the deprotection of side chains or crosslinking of backbone polymers catalysed by photogenerated acids.5 The second is based on photoinduced radical or cationic polymerisations of monomers6 mixed physically with, or covalently tethered to, backbone polymers. Chemically amplified photoresists (CAP) are based on the first class, and efforts have been made on exploiting negative- as well as positive-type CAP processed with water.2,7 Water-soluble PAGs were developed for this purpose. The second chemistry involving photopolymerisation usually requires a radical photoinitiator or PAG dissolved in fluid or solid. Though wet development is attainable by using an aqueous alkali for these types of photopolymers, the emission of organic solvents is inevitable during the film casting. This is because conventional photoinitiators or PAGs are hardly soluble or insoluble in water so they are dissolved in organic solvents to combine with polymers bearing carboxylic residues to formulate homogeneous solutions. Huge amounts of radical as well as cationic or even hybrid polymerisation-type photopolymers are used in industries for micron-scale photolithography because of good availability of components and flexible materials design for versatile applications. In this context, a way of approaching polymerisation-type water-borne photopolymers realizing non-VOC processes is strongly required. One of the approaches is based on improving the water-solubility of photoinitiators8 or PAGs,7 whereas numerous patent literatures are available concerning emulsifying hydrophobic monomers dissolving a radical photoinitiator in water to devise water-borne photopolymers.
Our strategy to formulate water-borne photopolymers is based on dispersing hardly water-soluble or water-insoluble PAGs as nano-sized particles in water to make films, which are developable with water after photopatterning. Taking into consideration that readily available PAGs are sensitive to wavelengths far shorter than ca. 350 nm, the expansion of their spectral sensitivity to be matched with conventional light sources should be considered from a practical viewpoint. In this respect, the solid-state sensitisation of PAGs is needed. Whereas elegant ways are reported to sensitise onium-type PAGs intramolecularly by binding a sensitiser moiety to a PAG molecule covalently9 or by salt formation10 to improve electron transfer efficiencies, the author's interest headed for examining solid-state electron transfer from a sensitiser to a PAG. This is simply because no chemical modification for modulating the solubility of both may be needed in solid-state photochemistry so that commercially available PAGs can be employed as received. In this context, aqueous dispersions of organic solid particles in the size range of nanometre to sub-micrometre11 are very fascinating because of pseudo-solution behaviour exhibiting high transparency as a result of notable suppression of light scattering. Concerning solid-state electron transfer, there had been no report, to the author's knowledge, except for hole injection from a dye layer12 or a solute such as tetrachlorophthalodinitrile13 into anthracene crystals to induce photocurrent. But the following facts motivated the author to do with the solid-state photosensitisation. Since the first report by Bowen,14 energy transfer systems in organic solids have been extensively studied15 in relation to organic light emitting diodes16 and photovoltaic solar cells17 to reveal that intermolecular photophysical processes take place through exciton diffusion in crystals. This situation means that the distance between donor and acceptor molecules for electron transfer can be much elongated by means of exciton diffusion.
This work aims to verify the validity of formulating cationic water-borne photopolymers by using aqueous dispersions of PAGs and mixtures of PAGs and sensitisers to achieve solid-state photoacid generation.18 The brief description of preparing nano-sized crystalline particles by mechanical milling is followed by studies on photochemical events of aqueous dispersions of PAGs co-milled with sensitisers to elucidate solid-state photosensitisation through crystal-to-crystal electron transfer liberating photoacids. Acidic species generated by the direct and sensitised photoacid generation work as an initiator or a catalyst for crosslinking of PVA with the aid of water-soluble acid-sensitive crosslinkers to demonstrate photolithography treated exclusively with neutral water throughout the process.

Physical measurements
Particle size distributions were taken on a Nano-Z, Sysmex, whereas absorption and fluorescence spectra were taken on a diode array Multistep 1500 and an RF-5300PC of Shimadzu, respectively. Film thickness was recorded on a profilometer (Tencor, Alpha-Step IQ) to obtain photosensitivity curves.
Fluorescence measurements were performed as follows. A dilute dispersion of 3a of OD = ca. 0.15 at λmax = 391 nm was placed in a quartz cell to record a fluorescence spectrum at a conventional 90° geometry to perform quenching experiments by water-soluble 2c. The fluorescence measurement of a concentrated (ca. 1 wt%) dispersion of a sensitiser was performed by setting it in a quartz cell of 3 mm depth to be excited at a 45° incidence to capture the emission from a surface layer at a 90° geometry. Care was taken to record quenched emission spectra in the presence of co-milled 2a quickly in a narrow wavelength region of 30 nm centered at the emission band at 465 nm for 3a to minimise the effect of reducing fluorescence intensity during the excitation owing to the solid-state photosensitised conversion. Combinations of 2a with the other sensitisers were subjected to fluorescence quenching measurements in a similar way. The excitation of 3a and 3b, 3c, 3d, 6 and 7 were achieved at 391, 391, 374, 380 and 370 nm, respectively.
Wet milling of a mixture of 2a and 3a as a typical procedure
An aqueous 5 wt% solution of PVA (DP = 500) (9.59 g) was placed in a grinding bowl (volume = 45 mL) made of zirconia containing zirconia beads of 3 mm diameter (10 mL), followed by adding 302.2 mg of crystals of 2a and 110.8 mg of 3a in a 1 : 1 molar ratio to be subjected to grinding at 400 rpm for 1 h in the presence of a few drops of an anti-foaming agent by using a planetary mill (Fritsch; Pulverisette 7). An averaged particle size of a dispersion thus prepared was 850 nm with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.459. Subsequently, the milling media was replaced by zirconia beads of 0.3 mm diameter to grind at 650 rpm for 1 h, followed by removing the beads by filtration to give particles of a size of 342 nm with a PDI of 0.214. Zirconia beads of diameters of 0.1 mm and 0.05 mm were also used if necessary.
Photoirradiation
A dilute aqueous dispersion of PAGs or a mixture of PAGs and a sensitiser was exposed to >350 nm light from a 500 W super-high pressure mercury arc and subjected to UV spectral measurements at intervals to follow the reaction. Preparative photochemistry of a dispersion of 3a was performed by irradiating an aqueous 0.2 wt% dispersion (20 mL) with >350 nm light until characteristic absorption bands of the anthracene disappeared completely. The dispersion was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was washed with water, followed by drying over magnesium sulfate and evaporating the solvent to isolate anthraquinone. A 70% yield of the product was estimated by UV spectral measurement of the organic layer.
An aqueous dispersion (0.2 wt%) of a mixture of PAGs and a sensitiser (20 mL) was exposed to >350 nm light from the mercury arc and subjected to alkaline titration with an 8.50 × 10−3 M NaOH solution using phenolphthalein as a colour indicator to estimate the amount of acid generated.
Photosensitivity determination
A suspension of 500.0 mg of the sulfonium salt (1) in 9.50 g of a 5 wt% of PVA (DP = 500) was ground in the planetary mill with zirconia beads of 0.3 mm diameter at 650 rpm for 2 h. A milky-white dispersion (1.00 g) was mixed thoroughly with 2.00 g of a 10 wt% aqueous solution of PVA (DP = 1700), 32.0 mg of the epoxy (4) and 0.5 g of deionised water to formulate a photosensitive composition. The dispersion was spin-cast on a glass plate at 1000 rpm, followed by blowing with a hair drier warmly to form a dried thin film, which was exposed to 313 nm light from a Hg–Xe lamp (SAN-EI Electric Co.; UVF-203S) passed through a solution filter (K2CrO4) and a glass filter (Asahi Technogalss; UV-D35). The film was baked at 110 °C for 2 min and developed with neutral water to record the remaining film thickness to obtain a photosensitivity curve. Photosensitivity curves for the other photopolymers were obtained in a similar fashion after exposure to 365 nm light (filters; UV-35 and UV-D35) or >350 nm (a filter; UV-35) light.
Results and discussion
Approaching non-VOC photolithographic processes based on the present concept, there are three steps to be exploited. The first is to achieve the nano-downsizing of crystalline particles of water-insoluble PAGs and mixtures of PAGs and a sensitiser to reduce light scattering of their dispersions, leading to improved optical quality of photosensitive films. Bead milling was employed here because of the ready availability of a tabletop planetary mill to carry out small-scale experiments. The second is to corroborate the photoacid generation from PAG sub-micron particles thus prepared. In this context, photochemistry of aqueous dispersions of sensitisers and mixtures of PAGs and sensitisers should be elucidated. The third is to apply the solid-state photoacid generation to water-developable photopolymer systems by employing a water-soluble polymer and an acid-sensitive crosslinker.
Preparation of aqueous dispersions of PAGs
First of all, water-solubility of the PAGs and sensitisers employed in this study (Fig. 1) is mentioned here in regard to the mechanism of solid-state sensitisation discussed below. Crystals of a sample were suspended in water under shaking to record an absorbance at λmax of a filtrate after removing the solid by paper filtration to estimate a saturated concentration. As summarised in Table 1, water-solubility of the onium-type PAGs (1, 2) was influenced, in particular, by a counteranion. Aromatic sensitisers (3, 4, 6 and 7) were essentially insoluble in water, whereas the ketocoumarin (5) was slightly water-soluble.

Nano-sized organic crystals have been so far fabricated by a reprecipitation technique consisting of pouring a dilute solution of an organic compound in a good solvent into a poor solvent under stirring,19 if necessary under ultrasonication,20 or microwave irradiation,21 to give nano-dispersions. An alternative way has been reported to give aqueous nano-dispersions of organic crystals by the layer-by-layer vacuum deposition of water and organic molecules on a cooled substrate plate in vacuum.22 Since conventional PAGs are of onium salts, the latter method is not suitable to the present purpose. Therefore, the reprecipitation method was at first examined to prepare aqueous dispersions of 3a as a sensitiser and the iodonium hexafluorophosphate (2a) as a PAG. According to the literature, a dilute (1 × 10−3 wt%) acetone solution of 3a was added carefully into water under stirring. Whereas a slightly turbid dispersion was obtained at the early stage of the addition, the deposition of crystals occurred suddenly at a critical volume of the solution. Quite the same situation was observed for 2a and a 1 : 1 (mol : mol) mixture of 2a and 3a. Whereas aqueous dispersions of nano-particles with averaged sizes ranging from 200 nm to 300 nm were prepared under specified conditions, this method was unsuitable for the present work, because the concentration of dispersed particles was too low (<1 × 10−4 wt%) to formulate photosensitive polymers doped with PAGs, concentrations of which should be few wt% or more.
Accordingly, we carried out bead milling by using a tabletop planetary mill to grind PAG crystals with or without the sensitiser in an aqueous solution of PVA in the presence of an anti-foaming agent. PVA was used as both a dispersion stabiliser and a binder polymer to be crosslinked acid-catalytically. Averaged particle sizes were influenced not only by grinding speed and period, but also by the nature of the components. A typical example of the effect of milling period on particle size is shown in Table S1.23 The results revealed that 3 h milling gives the optimal result in this case whereas particles begin to grow upon further mechanical treatment. It followed that appropriate conditions were optimised for each sample to obtain milky-white dispersions containing particles of sizes of sensitisers and mixtures of sensitisers and PAGs in the range from ca. 200 nm to 500 nm. The results are summarised in Table S2.23
Photochemistry of dispersed sensitisers
9,9′-Dialkoxyanthracenes24 and thioxanthones25 sensitise the photolysis of iodonium and sulfonium salts effectively to liberate strong acids. The photofatigue of 3a and 4 dispersed in water in the absence of PAGs was monitored by tracing spectral changes during UV irradiation prior to examining the photochemistry of dispersed mixtures of a sensitiser and PAG. It was found unexpectedly that 3a dispersed in water disappears upon >350 nm light irradiation and the solid-state degradation proceeds rather faster than in a hexane solution. As shown in Fig. 2A, the photoirradiation resulted in a decrease in the characteristic absorption bands of wavelengths longer than ca. 350 nm ascribable to the anthracene moiety to generate a new band centred at ca. 335 nm. Preparative photochemistry revealed that anthraquinone (AQ) is formed in good yield as a photoproduct. The solid-state photochemistry was confirmed by exposing crystals of 3a or 3d to UV light. Intensely fluorescent crystals displayed colour changes from yellowish into brown together with reduction of fluorescence intensity. Note here that it is advisable to avoid exposure of this type of sensitiser solid even to ambient light. In order to obtain further information of the solid-state formation of AQ, irradiation was carried out under argon stream to know whether photooxygenation participates in the photoreaction. Contrary to our anticipation, the photodegradation was accelerated rather under anaerobic conditions, as shown in Fig. 3. This situation indicates that oxygen quenches the photoreaction and that the (4 + 2) photocycloaddition of the oxygen molecule to the anthracene moiety plays no role in the formation of AQ. It follows that the solid-state photoconversion accompanied by two-electron oxidation may be illustrated as shown in Fig. 4. An excited molecule of 3 is coupled with a nearest neighbour molecule in a crystal to form an excimer, which undergoes charge separation to form a couple of a radical cation and an anion. An alkyl radical is eliminated from the radical anion to give an anionic species, which transfers one electron to the radical cation to give AQ and to regenerate the starting molecule.

UV exposure of 4 also led to marked spectral alteration, as sketched in Fig. 2B. Note, however, that the positions of λmax of characteristic absorption bands are essentially not altered even after prolonged irradiation although spectral shapes are considerably modified. This means that no change in molecular structure occurs. In fact, 4 was recovered by extraction from a UV-exposed dispersion with ethyl acetate. Since these results implied that the spectral changes of the dispersion come from physical properties of particles of 4, changes in particle size distribution were monitored by dynamic light scattering (DLS) during UV irradiation. It was observed that an averaged particle size of 898 nm before UV irradiation is reduced monotonously down to 488 nm upon prolonged irradiation. Though further study is necessary, it is very likely that UV irradiation leads to the break of crystalline particles of 4 without a chemical reaction. Photoinduced size reduction was observed also for an aqueous dispersion of 3a from 368 nm to 183 nm. In this case, the crystal break is likely to be triggered by the AQ formation. It should be noted that this sort of photoinduced size reduction of crystalline particles makes a turbid dispersion more transparent, leading to improving optical quality of a dispersed solution and film by photoirradiation.
Photochemistry of mixtures of sensitisers and PAGs
Photochemistry of aqueous dispersions of 2a and co-milled sensitisers was examined preliminarily by spectral measurements. The photoinduced disappearance of 3a in dispersions was accelerated by co-milling with an equimolar amount of 2a crystals (Fig. S1A),23 when compared with the result in the absence of 2a (Fig. 2A). The photospeed was enhanced markedly when the molar ratio was 3a : 2a = 1 : 3. UV-exposed aqueous dispersions of 2a and 3a mixtures became acidic after thorough disappearance of absorption bands of 3a. Their absorption spectra displayed λmax centred at ca. 335 nm ascribable to AQ, indicating that the sensitised photolysis of 2a occurs even in solid-state dispersions and competes with the formation of AQ. Photoirradiation of a dispersion of 2a with co-milled 5 displayed also the disappearance of the band at λmax = ca. 240 nm due to 2a (Fig. S1B).23 All of the results imply the occurrence of sensitised photolysis.
Attempts were made to follow the photoacid generation during UV irradiation of the dispersions by means of tetrabromophenolphthalene tetrasulfonate as a colour indicator. But this convenient method was not applicable to the present system. The iodonium cation combined with the sulfonate units of the dye to form a complex soluble in an organic solvent such as acetone, leading to severe modification of spectral shape. Consequently, alkaline titration was carried out. But an end point of the titration was not clear for the 2a-sensitiser system, and yields of acidic species estimated exceeded theoretical ones. This is probably because of a ligand exchange of HPF6 with H2O to generate HF.26 In this context, the triflate salt (2b) was employed for determining photoacid generation by alkaline titration on account of the stability of the anion toward alkali. It should be mentioned here that longer exposure time was needed, implying lower reactivity of 2b when compared with 2a. As shown in Fig. 5A, approximately quantitative generation of the acid was observed for a 1 : 1 (mol : mol) mixture of 2b and 3a under exclusive excitation of 3a (open squares in Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the chemical yield of photoacid levelled off at ca. 50% with respect to 2b when the mixing ratio of 2b and 3a is 0.5 : 1 (open triangles in Fig. 5A). It was assumed that the lower loading of 2b allows the predominant occurrence of the side reaction to give AQ. In line with this assumption, a 3 : 1 (mol : mol) mixture generates a photoacid in a yield of 231% on the basis of 3a loading (open circles in Fig. 5A), which is equivalent to the relatively high yield of 77% with respect to 2b, suggesting that 3a works as a sensitiser sufficiently. The photoacid generation sensitised with 4 is shown in Fig. 5B. Almost quantitative photoacid generation was observed for every mixing ratio. This is in accord with the photofatigue resistance of 4 in the absence of PAG. Fig. 6 summarises the photoacid generation from 2b sensitised with various sensitisers including 3c, 3d and 6 co-milled in a 1 : 1 (mol : mol) ratio. 3a and 4 act as the best sensitisers among them, followed by 3c, whereas sensitisation efficiencies of 3d and 6 were far lower. Concerning the ketocoumarin (5), it was difficult to trace the photosensitised acid generation by the alkaline titration using phenolphthalein because of the intense colour of 7.

All of the results described above mean that the photoacid generation comes from solid-state electron transfer from a sensitiser to 2b. Note here, however, that the salt is ionic so the water-solubility of 1.1 × 10−3 M cannot be neglected in this system. In order to check the possibility of whether the electron transfer occurs from excited sensitiser solid to photoacid generator molecules dissolved in water, diphenyliodonium chloride (2c) as a more water-soluble PAG was employed to prepare aqueous solutions to be mixed with an aqueous dispersion of 3a. A photodegradation rate of 3a was essentially not influenced by the presence of 2c at a concentration of 2 × 10−3 M. It can be concluded that soluble fractions of 2b play a negligible role in the photoacid generation.
Fluorescence measurements
To the author's knowledge, there has been no report on solid-state sensitised photochemistry through electron transfer among organic crystals except for hole injection to achieve photocurrent measurements.12,13 In this context, it was checked first whether electron transfer from 3a to an iodonium salt at the solid–fluid interface is possible. The chloride (2c), which is fairly water-soluble (Table 1), was used for fluorescence quenching experiments. Note again that 3a is not soluble at all as revealed by particle size analysis and absorption spectral measurements exhibiting a marked red shift and broadening of absorption bands in a dilute dispersion (Fig. S2).23 A Stern–Volmer constant (kqτ) in water was 8.6, whereas kqτ in acetonitrile solutions was 119 (Fig. S3).23 The results reveal the following. The fluorescence quenching of 3a particles by soluble 2c can occur at a solid–water interface. But assuming that a quenching constant (kq) of 2a is not far from that of 2c, a level of fluorescence quenching by a soluble fraction of 2a of 1.1 × 10−3 M is estimated to be 0.2% and negligibly small. This draws the conclusion that 2a can act essentially as a solid-state fluorescence quencher.
Fluorescence measurements of 3a co-milled with 2a to evaluate solid-state quenching efficiencies were achieved by using aqueous dispersions containing 1 wt% of 3a under excitation at a 45° incidence with respect to the cell surface to capture the emission from a surface layer at a 90° geometry. This is because estimating accurate absorbances at the excitation wavelength of dilute dispersions was difficult due to light scattering so the conventional 90° geometry measurement was not suitable. As illustrated in Fig. 7, since the spectral shapes of fluorescence of the 1 wt% dispersions in shorter wavelength regions were modified due to the internal filter effect, quenching was monitored at the third peak centered at 465 nm. Furthermore, measurements were conducted quickly, since emission intensity was reduced during the excitation owing to the solid-state photosensitised conversion. Fig. 8A shows relative fluorescence intensity (Φ/Φ0) as a function of molar fractions of co-milled 2a (open circles). Φ and Φ0 denote the fluorescence intensity of 3a without and with co-milled 2a, respectively. The results disclose that the fluorescence decreases linearly with an increase of the molar ratio of the solid quencher. In order to reveal a general aspect of crystal-to-crystal fluorescence quenching by 2a, aqueous dispersions of fluorescent crystals of anthracene (3c), its derivatives (3b and 3d) and pyrene (7) were co-milled with 2a at various mixing ratios. 3a, 3c, 3d and 7 exhibited linear decreases of fluorescence intensity as a function of the loading of 2a in a way similar to 3a. On the other hand, it should be noteworthy that the fluorescence quenching of 3d levels off at about 30–40% (full circles) and that no further quenching occurs even in the presence of excess amounts of 2a.

It is very probable that the photoinduced solid-state electron transfer takes place specifically between donor and acceptor molecules exposed to the topmost surfaces of grains. Accordingly, the diffusion of singlet excitons in sensitiser crystals15 plays an essential role to convey excited energy to a surface donor molecule, which transfers an electron to a surface acceptor molecule through the grain boundary. First of all, discussion is made on the combination of 3c and 2a, because 3c has been one of the most extensively studied compounds for exciton diffusion. The diffusion length (DL) of singlet excitons in crystals of 3c has been reported to be in the range of 46 nm to 77 nm15,22,27 so that the fluorescence can be sufficiently quenched when the averaged radius (Rs) of particles is shorter than DL. The fact that the fluorescence of milled 3c particles is thoroughly quenched even though a particle size (= 2 Rs) of ca. 300 nm is much larger than the DL value can be reasonably interpreted in terms of the following assumptions. First, size distributions analysed by DLS correspond not to primary particles, but to aggregated or agglomerated sub-grains of milled 3c. Second, the agglomerated or aggregated particles consist not only of sub-grains of 3c, but also of those of 2a. Thirdly, solid-state electron transfer occurs among the sub-grains as a result of intimate contact of 3c with 2a. This situation is sketched in Fig. 8B. Consequently, if Rs of sub-grains of a sensitiser solid is shorter than DL, fluorescence quenching occurs sufficiently as a result of direct contact among sub-grains of the sensitiser and 2a. This is the case for the 3c–2a combination. The requirement of higher loadings of 2a for thorough fluorescence quenching of 3a, 3b and 7, when compared with 3c, may arise from the difference in DL values, which may be shorter than those of 3c, whereas the DL values are not available. The solid-state fluorescence quenching behaviour of 3d is also in line with the assumptions. DL of 3d was reported to be 5.5 nm28 and much shorter than that of 3c. It is very likely that Rs of sub-grains of 3d is far shorter than DL under the present milling conditions so that the quenching occurs only at the surface region of the sub-grains, leading to insufficient quenching efficiencies, which level off even in the presence of excess amounts of 2a. As shown below, the fluorescence quenching behaviour is in accord with quite low photosensitivity of the type-C photopolymer dispersing the 2a–3d combination. Poor photosensitisation efficiency of perylene (6) arises also from a short DL, which was reported to be 0.34 nm.22 Concerning non-fluorescent or weakly fluorescent sensitisers for 2a, it is known that electron transfer from thioxanthone (5)25 and ketocoumarin (7)29 takes place from their triplet state. The diffusion of triplet excitons15b in these types of sensitiser crystals plays an essential role in solid-state photosensitisation.
PAG-dispersed photopolymers
In order to verify the validity of our concept of PAG-dispersed photopolymer systems, an aqueous dispersion of the sulfonium salt (1) was employed for the photoacid generation at first. This is because the monomolecular photolysis of the PAGs occurs even in the solid-state.30 PVA of DP = 1700 was used as a binder polymer, and its aqueous solution was mixed with an aqueous dispersion of 1. Two kinds of water-soluble acid-sensitive crosslinkers, a methylolmelamine derivative (8)7b and a diepoxy compound (9), were added to the mixture, respectively, to examine photosensitivity characteristics. This type-A photopolymer was comprised of 1, PVA and a crosslinker in concentrations of 0.60, 6.0 and 1.00 wt%, respectively. A spin-cast thin film was exposed to UV light, followed by post-exposure baking to accelerate the acid-catalysed crosslinking of PVA chains and development with water. It was revealed that difunctional 9 is better even though 8 is multifunctional (Fig. S4).23 The superior performance of 9 may come from the contribution of ring opening cationic polymerisation, which competes with the addition to OH residues of PVA main chains. On the basis of these results, 9 was used for the subsequent photosensitivity determination. It is known that conversions of epoxides in their UV cationic curing are reduced by high relative humidity.31 In this context, there is the possibility that residual water in films may influence photosensitivity characteristics more or less due to the hydrophilicity of PVA and the film preparation from aqueous solutions. Though the optimisation of conditions including prebaking is necessary, spin-cast films were dried in this work by blowing with a hair drier warmly and subjected to photosensitivity determination.
As shown in Fig. 9, thorough insolubilisation with a high contrast ratio was observed at an exposure dose of about 17 mJ cm−2 (closed circles), exhibiting photosensitivity comparable to conventional photopolymers. Taking quite a low saturated concentration of 4.8 × 10−3 wt% of 1 in water into consideration, the contribution of PAG molecules dissolved in water is negligible. Thus, the direct photolysis of solid particles of 1 occurs to generate HPF6, leading to the acid-catalysed insolubilisation of PVA. It should be mentioned here that the films were only slightly turbid, when compared with the milky-white aqueous dispersion, because light scattering is effectively reduced by the better matching of the refractive index of the PVA matrix with dispersed particles when compared with water.

The type-A photopolymer was not sensitive to 365 nm light at all so that 1 was co-milled with an equimolar amount of the sensitiser (3a) to prepare an aqueous dispersion, which was combined with PVA and 9 to provide a type-B photopolymer. It was found that irradiation with 365 nm light makes a film of the photopolymer insoluble in water though large exposure doses of more than 6000 mJ cm−2 are needed, disclosing that the sensitisation through solid-state electron transfer is feasible (open circles in Fig. 9). In order to attempt improving photosensitivity, the sulfonium salt (1) was replaced by the iodonium (2a) on the basis of the results described above, considering the thermodynamic requirements for photoinduced electron transfer.31 Consequently, an equimolar crystalline mixture of 2a and 3a was subjected to wet milling to formulate a type-C photopolymer. Thorough insolubilisation of a film of the photopolymer was attained at exposure doses of ca. 320 mJ cm−2, displaying notable improvement of photosensitivity. When the molar fraction of 3a was doubled, exposure doses were reduced down to ca. 120 mJ cm−2 (Fig. S5).23 A SEM picture and a surface profile of a negative-type relief pattern of the type-C photopolymer showed that the relief surface is slightly rough, reflecting probably grain sizes of unreacted particles (Fig. 10). Pattern edges are more or less unsharpened probably because of an elevated post-exposure baking temperature higher than the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PVA so further optimisation is necessary.

The film was exposed to >350 nm light through a photomask, followed by heating at 120 °C for 2 min and by washing with water to remove unexposed areas. 
PAG-dispersed water-borne photopolymers are now available even for the sensitised photoacid generation. The involvement of crystal-to-crystal sensitisation of 2a as an acceptor by 3a as a donor was furthermore confirmed by the following facts. Aqueous dispersions of 2a and 3a were prepared separately and mixed physically to formulate a photopolymer in such a way that concentrations of every component are the same as those of the type-C photopolymer comprising the co-milled crystalline mixture. The results are summarised in Table S3.23 Insolubilisation was not observed at all even upon prolonged irradiation of a film of the photopolymer, revealing that a very small fraction of dissolved 2a plays no role in displaying photosensitivity and consequently that particles of 2a and 3a should come in direct contact, leading to photoacid generation in line with the fluorescence quenching experiments. In this context, the separately prepared dispersions of 2a and 3a were combined and milled. Whereas no photosensitivity was observed for a physical mixture of both in a 1 : 1 molar ratio even after the milling, the milling of a 2 : 1 (mol : mol) mixture displayed photosensitivity though reduced by half when compared with the corresponding a 2 : 1 co-milled mixture. These results indicate that solid particles of both components are joined during the milling though the mixing efficiency is inferior when compared with the co-milled technique. This is probably because of a protective effect of PVA chains covering particle surfaces.
Photosensitivity determination was performed under irradiation with >350 nm light using the other sensitisers32 (3c, 3d, 4, 5 and 6), which were milled with equimolar amounts of 2a to formulate type-C photopolymers (Table S4).23 As summarised in Fig. 11 and Table 2, the results tell us the following. First, the nature of the sensitiser molecules influences photosensitisation efficiency considerably. 3a and 4 work as good photosensitisers, while 3d and 5 led to only partial insolubilisation even after prolonged irradiation. Second, sensitisation efficiency depends not only on donor and acceptor ratios, but also on particle sizes (combinations of runs 6 and 7 and of runs 8 and 9 in Table 2), suggesting that further reduction of particle sizes improves photosensitivity characteristics. In this respect, the advancement of milling technologies for nano-downsizing of organic pigment particles to manufacture pigment-dispersed colour filters33 and ink-jet inks34 may be closely related to the present subject.

Conclusions
The solid-state photolysis of scarcely water-soluble PAGs dispersed in water is applicable to the formulation of water-borne photopolymers comprised of PVA as a base polymer and an acid-sensitive crosslinker, providing polymerisation-type cationic photopolymers castable and developable solely with neutral water. The uniqueness of this type of PAG-dispersed photopolymer stems from the solid-state electron transfer from a sensitiser to a PAG to expand spectral sensitivity, and the results are summarised as follows.
(1) Scarcely water-soluble onium-type PAGs, water-insoluble sensitisers and mixtures of both were milled in an aqueous solution of PVA conveniently by a tabletop mill to give aqueous dispersions of particle sizes ranging from 200 nm to 500 nm under optimised conditions. Whereas the dispersions are milky-white, turbidity of cast films is reduced by better matching of the refractive index of PVA with those of organic particles when compared with water.
(2) Commercially available sensitisers exhibit characteristic photochemical events when dispersed in water. 9,10-Dialkoxyanthracene undergoes solid-state photoconversion into anthraquinone even under anaerobic conditions, whereas a thioxanthone dispersed in water displays size reduction of particles without marked photochemical reaction.
(3) The crystal-to-crystal electron transfer from sensitiser to co-milled PAG occurs to liberate strongly acidic species in aqueous dispersions when the following prerequisites are fulfilled. First, both the sensitiser and PAG crystals should be in direct contact with each other to transfer an electron from the former to the latter at the solid–solid interface through the migration of singlet or triplet excitons in sensitiser crystals. Second, the solid-state electron transfer occurs even though diameters of particles of the mixtures are in the sub-micron range, when an averaged radius of sub-grains consisting of aggregated or agglomerated particles are shorter than the exciton diffusion length.
(4) A PVA film dispersing particles of the sulfonium salt (1) exhibits fairly high photosensitivity of 17 mJ cm−2 in the presence of a water-soluble diepoxy crosslinker as a result of the direct solid-state photolysis upon exposure to 313 nm light. Whereas the sensitised photolysis of 1 results in low photosensitivity, the solid-state sensitisation of the iodonium salt (2a) by 9,9′-dialkoxyanthracene provides water-borne photopolymers with moderate photosensitivity of ca. 120 mJ cm−2 to 365 nm light. Photosensitivity of this kind of PAG-dispersed photopolymer is in line with solid-state fluorescence quenching efficiencies, revealing that exciton diffusion length in sensitiser crystals is one of the critical factors affecting photosensitivity performances.
Whereas the present PAG-dispersed photopolymers are applicable to micron-scale photolithography, the size reduction of PAG particles is required by all means from a practical viewpoint to improve photopolymer characteristics including photosensitivity, resolution power and optical transparency.
