    , Accepted 26th June 2022First published on 27th June 2022AbstractAs one of the cheapest photovoltaic polymers, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been considered as one of the prospective donor materials for commercial application. Thus, various non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), especially A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type molecules comprising one electron-donating (D) unit and two electron-withdrawing (A) units have been designed to improve the photovoltaic performance of P3HT. So far, the central D unit has been dominated by large conjugated heterocycles fused with thiophene and benzene rings. Herein, indacenodiselenophene (IDSe) and benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTA) were utilized as the central D part and bridged A1 unit respectively, to synthesize two novel A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs BTA46 and BTA47. To modulate the molecular planarity, absorption spectra and energy levels, 3-benzyl-rhodanine (R-Bn) and 3-benzyl-2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine (RCN-Bn) were used as the terminal units. P3HT:BTA47 combination demonstrates a higher PCE of 7.12% benefiting from the more efficient charge generation and transport in comparison with P3HT:BTA46 blend, which exhibits an inferior PCE of 3.99%. Detailed photoelectric properties and charge generation process analysis indicate that IDSe is a promising central core for A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs to combine with P3HT.
1. Introduction
With the advantages of light-weight, flexibility, and solution-processability, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted widespread attention over the past decades. In recent years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been rapidly improved.1–5 In addition to the rapid progress of non-fullerenes acceptors (NFAs),3,6–11 the design and synthesis of donor materials have also provided an extra boost to the dramatic improvement of efficiency. Currently, the most popular donor materials are composed of alternating donor (D) and acceptor (A) units, in which the ability of push–pull electrons can serve to modulate the energy levels of materials.12–18 Although such D–A copolymers have realized excellent optoelectronics properties, the somewhat complex synthetic routes inevitably bring the cost issues to commercial application. From this perspective, homopolymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) exhibits a significant advantage in simplifying the synthesis process and reducing production costs.
However, the absence of the push–pull effect along the backbone of P3HT leads to a large wide bandgap of ∼1.9 eV, and a relatively low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of ∼ −5.0 eV, making it relatively difficult to design acceptors matching with P3HT.19 So far, the efficiency of P3HT:fullerene devices has stagnated at 7.4%, and the reason for the lack of improvement in recent years is that the optoelectronic properties of fullerenes are difficult to finetune.20 In addition, due to the harsh film-forming conditions of P3HT, most of NFAs are not suitable for P3HT. Taking the most famous ITIC and Y6 as examples, the development of ITIC and Y6 has promoted the performance improvement of D–A polymer devices, but the mismatch with P3HT leads to generally low efficiency of 1.25%21 and 3.6%,22 respectively. Peng et al. designed a novel molecular acceptor of TrBTIC and realized high PCE over 8% by processing technology.23 Recently, Hou et al. developed ZY-4Cl by removing the cyano groups of Y-series molecules.24–26 After studying the molecular crystallinity and arrangement of P3HT and ZY-4Cl in the film formation process, a high PCE over 10% has been obtained in P3HT-based devices.
Relative to the large number of NFAs matching with D–A type polymers and the currently optimal PCEs over 18%, there are very limited materials can pair with P3HT and the performance still needs to be greatly improved. However, the key factors restricting the P3HT system have not yet been fully grasped. In our previous reports, we have systematically summarized the development of NFAs paired with P3HT.22 These NFAs can be simply divided into different types according to how the D and A units are linked in the molecular backbone. Among them, A–D–A is the most typical NFA structure,23,24,27–30 and the derived structures include A2–A1–D–A1–A2, A–D2–D1–D2–A and so on. In 2015, inverted organic photovoltaic devices employing an A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type small molecule FBR as the acceptor gave a PCE up to 4.1%, which outperformed the fullerene acceptor at that time, which is mainly attributed to the highly intermixed morphology of P3HT:FBR. Relative to the comparative P3HT:fullerene, the largely increased charge generation efficiency demonstrates that this kind of acceptor shows great promise for further P3HT-based device.31 Then, our team mainly focused on the A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs and designed a large number of NFAs. Since the weak electron withdrawing ability, benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTA) unit used as A1 unit is expected to upshift the energy level of acceptor to match better with P3HT for obtaining a relatively higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) and lower energy loss. In 2017, we synthesized the first BTA-based NFA, which contains rhodanine (R) and indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the terminal acceptor (A2) and central donor (D) unit, respectively. P3HT:BTA1 combination achieved a high VOC above 1 V and a PCE over 5%.29 After replacing the R unit in BTA1 with dicyanomethylene rhodanine (RCN) as terminal group, another A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFA, BTA3 showed an improved PCE of 5.64%.32 We attributed the suboptimal phase-separated morphologies and lower carrier mobility in these systems to the improper molecular arrangement of acceptor. Then, a benzyl unit was introduced into the terminal rhodamine group, the synthesized BTA5 with RCN-Bn as the terminal group exhibited an improved PCE of 6.01%.33 It was found that the benzyl group can effectively modify the aggregation, enhancing both the face-on orientation and π–π interaction of BTA5. In addition to the terminal groups, we also investigated the effect of the central core and side chains on the molecular properties and photovoltaic performance. For example, the replacement of alkylbenzene side chain of BTA3 with alkoxybenzene created a new molecule, BTA43, which showed an improved PCE to 6.56%.34 Our works indicate that the A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs with IDT as the central core and BTA as the A1 unit are good candidate to improve the performance of the P3HT.
So far, most of the reported A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type acceptors contain IDT as the central D unit, such as classical O-IDTBR, EH-IDTBR, etc.35 In these P3HT-based devices with IDT-based NFAs as active layers, the narrow light absorption capacity is still an important factor limiting the device performance, in particular resulting in relatively low short-circuit current (JSC). In order to further extend absorption spectra of A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs, the use of strong electron-donating D segment to displace the commonly employed IDT would be one effective approach to increase the performance of P3HT-based devices. We noted that the indacenodiselenophene (IDSe)-based polymer possessed improved absorption and higher charge mobility over its sulfur analogue.36 The narrowed bandgap might be due to the stronger orbital overlap with adjacent conjugated segments. In the A–D–A type acceptors combined with D–A polymers, the introduction of Se atoms into the multi fused-ring led to more planar molecular configuration and finally hopeful photovoltaic properties.37,38 Thus it can be seen IDSe has advantages of reducing bandgap, adjusting energy level and optimizing molecular packing properties. From the electrostatic potential (ESP) calculation as shown in Fig. 1(a), we also discovered the potential advantages that IDSe may have over IDT in tuning the bandgap and energy level.

Considering that A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type acceptors with IDSe central core have not been reported, we herein studied the application of such NFAs in order to obtain higher PCE. Two A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs containing IDSe as the central core with alkoxy side chain, BTA as the A1 unit were synthesized. To modulate the molecular planarity, absorption spectrum and energy levers, two groups R-Bn and RCN-Bn were used as the terminal A2 units. BTA46 has high-lying energy levels than that of BTA47 after substituting RCN-Bn with R-Bn. P3HT:BTA47 device demonstrated a high PCE of 7.12% with a VOC of 0.83 V, a JSC of 13.09 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 65.14%. However, P3HT:BTA46 device only exhibited a PCE of 3.99% with a relatively high VOC above 1 V. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectra were recorded and reveal the effect of terminal group on the charge generation dynamics at a deeper level. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements reveal that P3HT:BTA47 blend film has more suitable molecular stacking and morphology for charge generation and transport. The hole-only and electron-only devices also showed that the unbalanced mobility in P3HT:BTA46 may be one important factor limiting the device performance. These results indicate that the taking over IDT with IDSe as the central core of A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs is a feasible and effective strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance.
2. Results and discussion
Synthesis of IDSe-based NFAs
The chemical structures of two IDSe-based NFAs are described in Fig. 1(b). The synthesis routes for two NFAs are presented in Scheme S1 (ESI†). Compound 3 was prepared in 80% yield through the Stile cross–coupling reaction between compound 1 and compound 2, with Pd (PPh3)4 as catalyst. Then IDSe unit was directly obtained by the reaction of compound 3 with 4-hexyl-benzene magnesium bromide. IDSeBTA-CHO was synthesized by simple and efficient direct arylation coupling with a high yield of 84%. Then Knoevenagel condensation reaction was performed between the IDSeBTA-CHO and corresponding rhodanine derivatives to afford the NFAs with different terminal groups. Two NFAs exhibit high solubility in common halogenated and non-halogen solvents, which facilitate for solution processed OSC devices. The chemical structure of each new compounds was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF MS as presented in Fig. S1–S10 (ESI†).
Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of two NFAs in chloroform (CF) solutions and thin films are displayed in Fig. 1(d). Firstly we can notice that the absorption ranges of both acceptors are relatively complementary with that of P3HT. The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) absorption of BTA46 is in the range of 450–710 nm with a maximum molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 1.30 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1 at 613 nm (Fig. S11a, ESI†). BTA47 shows a red-shifted ICT absorption in the range of 470–750 nm with ε of 1.48 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1 at 636 nm. The red-shifted absorption peak of 23 nm comes from the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of RCN-Bn group. The absorption spectra of thin films are in the range of 468–780 nm with a peak at 638 nm for BTA46 and 480–800 nm with a peak at 666 nm for BTA47. It is noteworthy that obvious shoulder peaks can be found in both films, which indicates strong π–π stacking of these two molecules. The wider absorption range of P3HT:BTA47 combination would be beneficial to improve the JSC. Their bandgaps are extracted from the absorption band edge and estimated to be 1.77 and 1.69 eV, respectively. The optical data at ambient temperature is summarized in Table 1.

The HOMO energy levels (EHOMO) of two NFAs were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) as presented in Fig. S11b (ESI†), and the low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (ELUMO) were calculated by subtracting the optical bandgap from EHOMO. The energy diagram is shown in Fig. 1(d). BTA46 shows higher-lying HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.28/−3.51 eV than that of BTA47 (−5.37/−3.68 eV), which will benefit to obtain higher VOC. To investigate the effect of end groups on the molecular configuration of IDSe-based NFAs, their geometries were optimized by density functional theory (DFT) with Gaussian at the B3LYP/6-31G level of theory. From the side view as shown in Fig. 2(a), both NFAs have excellent planarity, which facilitates the intramolecular charge transfer. The top view as presented in Fig. 2(b) reveals that BTA46 has smaller dihedral angles between IDSe unit and BTA unit and between BTA unit and end group than that of BTA47. Therefore, the more planar BTA46 is possibly favorable for intermolecular π–π stacking.37 In Fig. 2(c), we can obviously see that the HOMO/LUMO wave functions are well delocalized in the backbone of both NFAs. The impact of end group on the energy levels is same with that obtained from CV measurement.

Photovoltaic performance
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al structure were fabricated to evaluate the application of IDSe-based NFAs in P3HT-based devices. Where, ITO represents indium tin oxide, PEDOT:PSS is the abbreviation of [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrene sulfonate)]. Systematic optimizations were performed for both combinations as listed in Table 2 and Tables S1–S6 (ESI†). By optimizing the D/A ratio, annealing temperature, additives, film thickness, interface layer and device structure, the best PCEs are obtained, and the corresponding current density versus voltage (J–V) curves are exhibited in Fig. 3(a). P3HT:BTA46 device shows a PCE of 3.99% with a high VOC of 1.03 V because of the raised LUMO energy level, a JSC of 7.24 mA cm−2, an FF of 53.47%. Although P3HT:BTA47 device exhibits a decreased VOC to 0.83 V compared with BTA46, simultaneously improved JSC of 13.09 mA cm−2 and FF of 65.14% finally result in a high PCE of 7.12%. The enhanced JSC and FF of P3HT:BTA47 device may be not only due to the significant light absorption but also the promotion of charge transport properties. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of these devices are illustrated in Fig. 3(b). The relatively flat EQE curves of P3HT:BTA46 devices in the 300–720 nm region reveal balanced and effective charge separation at the P3HT/BTA46 interface. In the case of P3HT:BTA47 devices, the relatively higher EQE values in range of 400–600 nm than that of 600–700 nm region indicate that the hole transfer from BTA47 to P3HT might be insufficient. The higher photo response of P3HT:BTA47 devices should be attributed to the broaden absorption range of blend film and other aspects, which will be discussed below. The integrated current density Jcal from EQE curves match well with the JSC from the J–V curve.

Compared with our previously reported analogue BTA5 (VOC = 0.91 V, JSC = 10.15 mA cm−2, FF = 0.65, PCE = 6.01%), the severely decreased FF of P3HT:BTA46 imply that the end-capped CN groups played an important role on optimizing P3HT-based blend morphology. The lower JSC values of P3HT:BTA46 is attributed to the reduced charge generation efficiency by the non-ideal morphology compared to P3HT:BTA5 and P3HT:BTA47. Relative to P3HT:BTA5, the enhancement of JSC of P3HT:BTA47 is beneficial from the central IDSe unit, which is also the main reason for the outperformed device performance.34 Considering the different energy levels of BTA46 and BTA47, the different device performance may also be caused by different compatibility between the active layer and the charge transporting layers. Therefore, we also fabricated conventional structured OPV devices with other electron transporting layers such as PDINO and PFN-Br in addition to Ca and inverted OPV devices. The resulted device parameters have been summarized in Tables S5 and S6 (ESI†). We found that the device performance of P3HT:BTA47 is always better than that of P3HT:BTA46 regardless of the interface layer or device architecture, which means that the interface charge extraction and transport are not the main reasons for the poor performance of P3HT:BTA46.
Charge generation and transport
The exciton and charge carrier dynamics of these two systems were investigated by femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy. TA images and the corresponding spectra of P3HT, BTA46 and BTA47 neat films excited at 450 nm and 650 nm are shown in Fig, S12–S14 (ESI†), respectively. The exciton and charge carrier dynamics are analyzed by fitting with exponential decay function, and the obtained decay time (τD) constants are listed in Table S7 (ESI†). The ground state bleaching (GSB) signals of P3HT neat film are in the range of 450–630 nm. As the previous study, the positive signals at around 650 nm belong to the polaron pairs of P3HT.39 And, P3HT also exhibits broad excited state absorption (ESA) bands over 750 nm, where the absorption band for the singlet exciton is centered at 1250 nm.40,41 P3HT can also form polaron even upon initial excitation,42 therefore, here the characteristic absorption band centered at 1000 nm observed after 1 ns is attributed to polaron absorption. Compared to the generated TA signals when excited at 450 nm, P3HT exhibited weak GSB and ESA signals when excited at 650 nm.

BTA46 neat film displays broad TA spectrum over 500–1350 nm, with negative GSB in the range of 500–750 nm and positive ESA in the range of 820–1350 nm. Except for the main singlet exciton absorption centered at 1150 nm, there are also weak absorption bands at 900 nm and 1000 nm. According to the previous study on an analogue acceptor, the peak at 1000 nm is possibly assigned to the polaron absorption band, and the region below 900 nm is possibly attributed to the intramolecular charge-transfer.39 The co-occurrence of polaron with singlet exciton immediately upon excitation may be due to the high crystallinity property and strong π–π stacking of BTA46. After 1 ns, the singlet exciton at 1150 nm is completely converted to polarons in the range of 950–1100 nm. BTA47 exhibited similar TA signals with BTA46. The band centered at 1130 nm is the singlet exciton absorption of BTA47, and the peak at 1000 nm comes from the polaron absorption. Unlike BTA46, the intramolecular charge-transfer peak of BTA47 is not obvious, which may be related to the twisted molecular backbone. As shown in Table S7 (ESI†), the recovery of ground-state of BTA46 probed at 650 nm can be described by three-time constants τ1 = 0.49 ± 0.2 ps (−51%), τ2 = 4.2 ± 1.8 ps (−32%), and τ3 = 71 ± 25 ps (−17%), and the corresponding relative population is given in parenthesis. Compared to the recovery of BTA47 probed at 680 nm (τ1 = 0.9 ± 0.2 ps (−54%), τ2 = 10 ± 3 ps (−31%), and τ3 = 142 ± 46 ps (−15%)), the different recovery dynamic implies that the ordered structure may contribute to the fast recovery of excited state to ground state in BTA46.
In order to investigate the charge generation at the D/A interface, the TA measurements were also conducted on P3HT:BTA46 and P3HT:BTA47 blend films with selectively exciting donor or acceptor at 450 nm and 650 nm, respectively. Fig. 4 and 5 display TA images, spectra and subtracted decay profiles of P3HT:BTA46 and P3HT:BTA47 blend films. At a pump wavelength of 450 nm, P3HT is only excited on blend film of P3HT:BTA46. The black solid curves represent the TA spectra of P3HT pristine film at a probe decay of 1 ps. The negative features resulting from the GSB are mainly created by P3HT. At around 640 nm, the absent positive ESA feature of P3HT results from the electron transfer from P3HT to BTA46. A new feature at around 680 nm gradually increases before 100 ps, which corresponds to the charge transfer from P3HT to BTA46 at the D/A interface. Because the triplet absorption of P3HT is known to be a broad band in the region of 600–800 nm, the long-lived species here are roughly assigned to the triplet excitons.43 One broad absorption band centered at around 1190 nm was observed immediately after the laser excitation, which rapidly decayed on a time scale of tens of picoseconds. The TA spectra at 1 ps can well be simulated by the TA spectra of each pristine film of P3HT and BTA46, suggesting that the major transient species are singlet excitons of P3HT and BTA46 after initial excitation. After 100 ps, both P3HT and BTA46 singlet excitons disappeared and instead a broad absorption band centered at around 1000 nm ascribed to the polarons of P3HT was observed, which subsequently dissociate into free carriers. To analyze the spectral change, we employed the spectrum at 1 ps of P3HT pristine film as the template of P3HT singlet exciton, the spectrum at 1 ps of BTA46 pristine film as the template of BTA46 singlet exciton and the spectrum at 1ns of P3HT:BTA46 blend film as the template of P3HT polaron because the absorption band of P3HT singlet exciton completely disappear at 1 ns.44 After decomposing the TA spectra from 1 to 10 ps, we obtain the time evolution of singlet exciton and polaron at 1250 nm and 1000 nm respectively as shown in Fig. 4(c). The decay constant of singlet exciton is consistent with the rise constant of polarons, suggesting polarons are generated from P3HT singlet exciton and the same constant is also observed at 680 nm showing a rise time (τR) of 4.5 ± 2.5 ps as shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†). Similar to the above case of excitation at 450 nm, we also observed that a new peak at 680 nm increases with a time constant of 5.6 ± 0.4 ps when exciting P3HT:BTA46 upon 650 nm, indicating that the hole transfer from BTA46 to P3HT is slower than the electron transfer from P3HT to BTA46. The time evolution of BTA46 singlet exciton at 1150 nm after reconstructing transient spectra from 1 ps to 1 ns also exhibit the same constant, as shown in Fig. 4(f).

The TA spectra for the blended film P3HT:BTA47 upon 450 nm excitation shows, in addition to the clearly identifiable GSB of P3HT, negative feature at 640 nm that we attribute to the GSB of BTA47. Therefore, there is possible occurrence of energy transfer from P3HT to BTA47, which was not clearly observed in P3HT:BTA46. The photoinduced absorption at 730 nm rises very fast with a time constant of 0.9 ± 0.1 ps (as shown in Fig. S15, ESI†), which corresponds to fast electron transfer from P3HT to BTA47. At 10 ps, the peak at 1150 nm diminishes rapidly, and a broad peak at 1000 nm increases. After using a linear combination of the P3HT singlet exciton, BTA47 singlet exciton and polaron spectrum, the transient spectra from 1 to 10 ps were reconstructed and the time evolution of P3HT singlet and exciton and polarons are obtained as shown in Fig. 5(c), which is consistent with the τR of excited-state absorption at 730 nm. Compared with P3HT:BTA46 system, P3HT:BTA47 shows faster electron transfer from P3HT to BTA47. When P3HT:BTA47 blend is excited at 650 nm, negative GSB features mainly come from BTA47. The GSB probed at 500 nm ascribed to P3HT might be due to the energy transfer from BTA47 to P3HT. The ESA signal probed at 730 nm shows τR of 1.9 ± 0.2 ps by fitting the data to an exponential function, which is consistent with the τD of BTA47 singlet exciton as shown in Fig. 5(f). Thus, it can be seen that the charge generation of P3HT:BTA47 is much faster than that of P3HT:BTA46, whether the exciton of P3HT dissociate to form charge-transfer state or the excitons of acceptor are dissociated to form charge-state state.
In order to investigate the charge generation in P3HT:BTA47, we also changed the weight ratio of P3HT and BTA47 in blend film. Fig. S16 (ESI†) shows the TA image and spectra of P3HT:BTA47 blend films with a weight ratio of 1:1.5 excited at 450 and 650 nm. Because of the decreased content of P3HT, the negative signals ascribed to the GSB of P3HT become very weak when exciting at 450 nm. By comparing the decay kinetics of 1000 nm and 1250 nm in the range of ESA as shown in Fig. S17, ESI,† we found that the electron transfer from P3HT to BTA47 is faster than that of the optimal weight ratio (2:1). The dispersion of P3HT in the BTA47 phase might is more favorable for charge transport. In conclusion, P3HT:BTA47 exhibits faster electron and hole transport than P3HT:BTA46. And in these two systems, the electron transport from donor to acceptor is much faster than the hole transport from acceptor to donor.
Then, we investigated the exciton dissociation efficiency and charge collection efficiency of these two devices by using Jph/Jsat under the condition of short-circuit and maximal power output, respectively. Firstly, the photocurrent (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves of the optimized device were plotted as depicted in Fig. 6(a). Jph is calculated by Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the photo and dark current densities, respectively. Veff is determined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage.45,46 From the Jph–Veff curves, it can be seen that the Jph of P3HT:BTA47 device gradually increased and reached saturation at 0.8 V. The Jph of P3HT:BTA46 device exhibits field dependence of exciton dissociation, that is, there may be severe geminate charge recombination.47 Under short-circuit condition, the exciton dissociation efficiency of P3HT:BTA46 and P3HT:BTA47 devices were roughly estimated to be 80.7% and 96.6%. Under maximal power output condition, P3HT:BTA46 showed lower charge collection effciency of 64.8% than that of P3HT:BTA47 (88.8%) devices. The excellent exciton dissociation ability and charge collection efficiencies of P3HT:BTA47 are line with the enhanced JSC and FF of the device. In order to prove that the lower exciton dissociation and charge collection are indeed the dominant reason for BTA46, we plotted the exciton dissociation efficiency and charge collection efficiency against the thickness of the corresponding blend, as presented in Fig. 6(b) and (c) and Fig. S18 (ESI†). For all the active layers with different thicknesses, P3HT:BTA47 devices show superior efficiency of exciton dissociation and charge collection, which can be well supported by the increased device performance.

The charge recombination properties of these two devices were evaluated by the dependence of JSC on the light intensity. The relationship between JSC and Plight satisfies the following formula: JSC ∝ Pαlight, where α is an exponential factor, representing the degree of free charge extraction before bimolecular recombination.48 Usually, α = 1 indicates that all of the free charges can be extracted before recombination, while α < 1 implies the existence of bimolecular recombination. As presented in Fig. 6(d), P3HT:BTA47 device has an α value of 0.97 more closer to 1 than that of P3HT:BTA46 device with a smaller α value of 0.90. The stronger bimolecular recombination in the active layer of P3HT:BTA46 may result in inferior JSC and FF.
In order to deeply understand the photogenerated current process after blending IDSe-based acceptors with P3HT, we used space charge limited current (SCLC) method to study the carrier transport of active layer. The hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated with the structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al, respectively. Hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) were obtained by using the Mott–Gurney equation as descripted in (ESI†).49 The corresponding J–V curves and calculated mobilities are presented in Fig. 6(e) and (f). P3HT:BTA46 device shows higher μh of 4.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, but lower μe of 1.20 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to P3HT:BTA47 device with a lower μh of 1.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and higher μe of 6.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The more balanced μh/μe of 1.88 in P3HT:BTA47 than that of P3HT:BTA46 (μh/μe = 40.16) can partly explain the reason for the improved JSC and FF of P3HT:BTA47 device.
Molecular packing and film morphology
In order to better understand the molecular packing and blend film morphology of IDSe-based NFAs, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were conducted on the optimal blend films. As shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), P3HT:BTA46 blend film exhibits more clear diffraction features than P3HT:BTA47 blend film along both the out of plane (OOP) and in plane (IP) directions. Therefore, BTA46 shows much stronger crystalline than BTA47. This may be one reason why P3HT:BTA46 has higher hole mobility. The obvious diffraction features along the OOP directions indicate that face-on orientation is dominate in two blend films. The weak diffraction signal in the IP direction of P3HT:BTA46 blend film suggests that there is also a partial edge-on arrangement. The preferred face-on orientation in the P3HT:BTA47 blend film is favorable for the charge transfer and collection in the vertical direction. The π–π stacking distance of BTA46 and BTA47 blend films are estimated to be 3.77 and 3.80 Å, respectively. The smaller π–π stacking distance of the BTA46-based blend film primarily results from the stronger molecular planarity of acceptor. The detailed data are summarized in Table S8 (ESI†). The morphologies of two blend films obtained from AFM performance are presented in Fig. 7(c). The height images indicate that the surface of P3HT:BTA46 blend film is rougher with a root-mean-square (RMS) of 2.99 nm than that of P3HT:BTA47 blend film (RMS = 0.80 nm). The strong crystallinity of BTA46 leads to excessive phase separation of BTA46 and P3HT in the blend film, making the surface rougher, which is also illustrated by the inserted phase separation image. The smooth surface of P3HT:BTA47 are also benefit to better contact between active layer and electrode for charge collection and thus improving both JSC and FF of P3HT:BTA47 device.50

3. Conclusion
In this work, two A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs BTA46 and BTA47 with IDSe central core were synthesized. P3HT:BTA47 device demonstrated a high PCE of 7.12%, a VOC of 0.83 V, a JSC of 13.09 mA cm−2 and an FF of 65.14% without any solvent additive. The high-lying energy level of BTA46 leads to an increased VOC up to above 1.0 V, but slightly lower JSC of 7.24 mA cm−2 and FF of 53.47% resulted in a suboptimal PCE of only 3.99%. The stronger molecular planarity BTA46 after replacement of RCN-Bn with R-Bn may be the main reason for the unsuitable phase separation, which in turn leads to unbalanced carrier mobility and severe recombination process. The broad light absorption, balanced carrier mobility, and suitable phase separation size are the comprehensive factors that improve the photovoltaic performance of P3HT:BTA47. These results indicate that IDSe is an ideal D unit to construct A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs pairing with P3HT. Furthermore, the interaction of the end groups in A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type NFAs needs to be further regulated to obtain a better interpenetrating bicontinuous network structure, which is beneficial to exciton separation, charge transport and collection for P3HT-based OSCs.
