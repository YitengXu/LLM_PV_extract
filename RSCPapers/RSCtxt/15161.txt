    , Accepted 10th June 2019First published on 10th June 2019AbstractDesign of heteronanostructures with controlled topologies and configurations is receiving ever-increasing attention for developing practical photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical systems. Herein, we present a promising solar energy conversion platform constructed using the intimate contact of a plasmonic metal (octahedral Au nanocrystals), semiconductor (TiO2), and graphene with a well-defined configuration. The shell engineering of Au nanocrystals with TiO2 and graphene through sequential sol–gel, self-assembly, and post-calcination processes could allow the generation of graphene-encapsulated (octahedral Au nanocrystals)@(anatase TiO2) core–shell nanostructures. The prepared ternary heteronanostructures exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity over their binary counterparts, single-component catalysts, and physical mixtures of the constituents under visible-light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). Furthermore, they effectively utilized the red-light region for photocatalytic reactions. Detailed mechanism studies on the photocatalysis revealed that the prominent photocatalytic performance of the heteronanostructures can be attributed to the transfer of plasmon-induced hot electrons from Au nanocrystals to TiO2 and the subsequent migration of the photogenerated electrons to graphene, which could be facilitated by the intimate contact between the constituent materials. This study can provide a new insight into devising heteronanostructures for efficient light harvesting.
Introduction
Converting solar to chemical energy, such as hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, and water decontamination, with efficient photocatalytic platforms has attracted enormous attention to address increasing energy and environmental issues.1–6 Since the discovery of the photocatalytic hydrogen production with TiO2 under UV-light irradiation,7 nanoscale TiO2 materials have been widely studied as photocatalysts due to their capability for electron–hole pair generation, long-term stability against photo/chemical corrosion, nontoxicity, and low cost.8–10 However, despite considerable efforts to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 materials by controlling their facets,11–13 structure,14–16 and crystallinity,17–19 the intrinsic low efficiency of light utilization originating from their wide band gap and rapid charge carrier recombination impedes their practical applications.20,21
As a promising strategy to overcome the above disadvantages, hybridizing TiO2 with graphene, a monolayer of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms tightly bound to a honeycomb network, has been proposed.22–25 The superior conductivity and large specific surface area of graphene can facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons to reactants and thus inhibit the recombination of charge carriers.26,27 However, the limited light absorption of TiO2–graphene hybrids is still an issue in their application in solar energy conversion. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the photocatalytic efficiency of semiconductor-based nanomaterials can be promoted by incorporating plasmonic metal (Au or Ag) nanocrystals (NCs) that can strongly interact with visible light via localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR).28–30 In metal–semiconductor heteronanostructures, the plasmon energy generated from the LSPR excitation of the metal NC domain upon visible-light irradiation can be transferred to the adjacent semiconductor through the radiative relaxation of LSPR (scattering), hot electron transfer (HET), and/or plasmon-induced resonant energy transfer (PIRET), which can in turn increase the charge carrier density in the semiconductor domains.30–34 However, most of the metal–semiconductor heteronanostructures consisting of Au or Ag NCs cannot fully exploit a wide range of the solar spectrum,35 especially the red-light region (600–740 nm), where the peak of the solar spectrum is located,36–38 though there have been a few reports on metal–semiconductor heteronanostructures that are photocatalytically active in the red-light region.39,40
Based on these previous findings, it can be inferred that devising metal–TiO2–graphene ternary heteronanostructures with high wide-range visible-light photocatalytic performance is highly desirable to develop efficient light-harvesting platforms. Although there have been a few studies on metal–TiO2–graphene hybrids,41–47 the formation of such ternary heteronanostructures using well-defined metal NCs with sharp edges and corners, which can allow the better utilization of plasmon energy compared to NCs having spherical or irregular shapes,31,32 and the realization of sufficient synergism between the constituent materials are still highly challenging. In addition, the reported metal–TiO2–graphene hybrids barely exhibited considerable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity under red-light irradiation. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of their photocatalytic function has not yet been clearly verified.
Here, we report a synthesis approach for the fabrication of hierarchical metal–semiconductor–graphene ternary heteronanostructures consisting of octahedral Au NC (Au ONC) cores, mesoporous anatase TiO2 shells, and graphene envelopes for visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Graphene-encapsulated (Au ONCs)@(anatase TiO2) core–shell nanostructures (G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs) with a well-defined configuration were successfully prepared via sequential sol–gel, self-assembly, and post-calcination processes using Au ONCs as seed materials (Fig. 1a). (Au ONCs)@(amorphous TiO2) CSNs (AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs) were first generated by the hydrolysis of Ti precursors, TiCl3, on the Au ONCs. Graphene oxide (GO) could then be self-assembled on the surface of the AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs after functionalization with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS), forming GO-encapsulated AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs (GO–AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs). Finally, the GO–AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs were transformed to the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs through the simultaneous crystallization of amorphous TiO2 and the thermal reduction of GO by post-calcination. Notably, the prepared G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs showed pronounced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity under wide-range visible-light irradiation in comparison to their binary counterparts, single-component nanoparticles (NPs), and the physical mixture of the constituent materials. Based on the results of control experiments and mechanism studies on the photocatalysis, we could corroborate that the excellent solar energy conversion of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs is due to the HET from the LSPR-excited Au ONC cores to the TiO2 shells and subsequent electron transfer from the TiO2 shells to the graphene envelopes, which are facilitated by intimate contact between the constituents.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of ternary heteronanostructures
As illustrated in Fig. 1a (synthesis details are described in the Experimental section), to produce G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, Au ONCs were first synthesized to be used as seed materials. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the prepared Au ONCs shown in Fig. 1b and f, respectively, demonstrate that monodisperse Au ONCs with an average edge length of 45 ± 5 nm were successfully prepared. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Au ONCs indicates their face-centered cubic (fcc) structure (Fig. S1†). Then, amorphous TiO2 layers were overgrown on the Au ONC seeds through a sol–gel method using TiCl3 as a Ti precursor.48 The SEM and TEM images and XRD pattern of the product demonstrate that the hydrolysis of TiCl3 on the Au ONCs led to the formation of AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs with an average TiO2 shell thickness of 87 ± 9 nm (Fig. 1c and g and S2†). The AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs were then modified with APTMS to endow their TiO2 shells with positive charges, and a few layers of negatively charged GO sheets, which were prepared by a modified Hummer's method (Fig. S3†),49–51 were self-assembled onto the positively charged surface of the APTMS-modified AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs, yielding GO–AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs. GO sheets encapsulating the AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs were clearly identified in the SEM and TEM images of GO–AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs prepared with 0.5 wt% GO (Fig. 1d and h). When the GO encapsulation was carried out without the surface modification of the AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs, GO sheets were not well deposited onto the AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs (Fig. S4†). Notably, no characteristic peak of GO at around 10° was observed in the XRD pattern of the GO–AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs (Fig. S5†). This is due to the low weight percentage of the GO sheets and the destruction of the stacking pattern of GO during the encapsulation process. Finally, G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs were produced by the calcination of the GO–AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs, which can enable the crystallization of the amorphous TiO2 shells and the thermal reduction of GO simultaneously. The SEM, TEM, and high-magnification TEM images of the final product are shown in Fig. 1e, i and 2a, respectively. Notably, the intimate contact between graphene nanosheets with a uniform thickness and a crystalline TiO2 shell with a d-spacing of 0.245 nm between adjacent lattice fringes, which can be indexed to the (004) plane of anatase, could be discerned in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the prepared G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs (Fig. 2b). The high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM), corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images, and EDS cross-sectional compositional line profiles of a G–AuONC@TiO2 CSN distinctly confirm the hierarchical core–shell structure of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs (Fig. 2c and d). The average diameter of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs was 187 ± 15 nm. The TEM analysis of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs further demonstrated that the Au ONC cores maintained their size and shape after the calcination process, which will benefit solar energy harvesting through plasmonic excitation, and the TiO2 shells had a mesoporous structure, which can allow the transport of reactive species to the surface of the Au ONCs. As shown in Fig. 2e, the XRD pattern of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks of fcc Au and anatase TiO2, while a peak for graphene around 26° was not detected because of the broad peak associated with the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 and the low weight percentage of the graphene sheets.

The positions of Au and anatase TiO2 references were taken from the JCPDS database (Au: 65-2870, anatase TiO2: 21-1272). 
To investigate the chemical state of each constituent in the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements for the C 1s, Ti 2p, and Au 4f core levels were conducted and the results were compared with those of the GO–AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs, AuONC@anatase TiO2 CSNs (AuONC@TiO2 CSNs), and Au ONCs. The AuONC@TiO2 CSNs with crystalline TiO2 shells were obtained by the calcination of the AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs without the GO encapsulation (Fig. S6†). As shown in the C 1s XPS spectra of the G–AuONC@TiO2 and GO–AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs (Fig. S7†), the oxygenated carbons of the GO–AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs were significantly reduced after the calcination process, indicating the successful conversion of GO into graphene.42,43,52,53 The Ti 2p XPS peaks of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs were observed at 464.9 and 459.2 eV, suggesting the Ti(IV) state of Ti in the TiO2 shells (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, the Ti 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 binding energies of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs blue-shifted by 0.4 and 0.5 eV, respectively, compared to those of the AuONC@TiO2 CSNs. This indicates the presence of strong chemical interaction between the TiO2 surfaces and graphene sheets in the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs.43 This chemical interaction was further explored by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. 3b). For the AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, a peak for the characteristic vibrational mode of Ti–O–Ti bonds was observed at 634 cm−1. However, the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs exhibited an additional peak at 898 cm−1 corresponding to the vibrational mode of Ti–O–C bonds together with that of Ti–O–Ti bonds, which clearly signifies the formation of chemical bonds between TiO2 and graphene.54,55 In fact, the oxygen functional groups in the GO sheets can firmly interact with the hydroxyl groups at the TiO2 surface, leading to the formation of the chemical bonds during the calcination.54 The XPS peaks for the Au 4f core level of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs appeared at 87.0 and 83.3 eV, which are red-shifted by about 0.9 eV compared to those of the pristine Au ONCs (Fig. 3c). This reveals that there is indeed intimate electronic coupling between the Au cores and the TiO2 shells.42 Notably, this electronic coupling had a profound influence on the LSPR characteristics of the Au ONCs. While the pristine Au ONCs showed a typical LSPR peak at 559 nm associated with the dipole plasmon mode in their extinction spectrum, the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs exhibited a significantly red-shifted, but still a large LSPR band at ∼695 nm (Fig. 3d). This can be attributed to the strong electronic interaction between the Au cores and the TiO2 shells as well as the high refractive index of TiO2.56–59 On the other hand, the GO–AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs exhibited a LSPR peak at 629 nm, which is in between those of the Au ONCs and G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs. The further red-shift of the LSPR peak of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs compared to the GO–AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs can be attributed to the increased contact area and interaction between Au and TiO2 after the calcination.39,57 Taken together, the proposed synthetic approach for the formation of hierarchical metal–semiconductor–graphene ternary heteronanostructures can enable intimate contact and thus strong interaction between the constituent materials, which will expedite synergism between the constituents in photocatalytic applications. Furthermore, it can be inferred that the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs could effectively utilize red light for photocatalytic reactions due to the red-shifted LSPR band of their Au ONC cores.

Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with ternary heteronanostructures
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution experiments were conducted under visible-light (λ > 400 nm) irradiation with a 300 W Xe lamp (power density = 150 mW cm−2) in an aqueous solution containing methanol (25 vol%), which can act as a sacrificial hole scavenger.60 Methanol was chosen as a hole scavenger as it was found to be the most effective in the photocatalysis among various hole scavengers, such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, and triethylamine (Fig. S8†). The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions with G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs prepared with different amounts of graphene were investigated to find an optimum graphene content for photocatalysis. The amount of graphene in the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs could be controlled by changing the amount of GO introduced during the synthesis of the heteronanostructures, i.e., 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 wt% (Fig. S9†). The results of photocatalysis with the different G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs are summarized in Fig. S10†. The G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs prepared with 0.5 wt% GO showed higher hydrogen evolution activity than the hybrids prepared with 0.25 wt% GO. This is because the higher content of graphene can facilitate the transfer of photoexcited electrons from TiO2 and thereby suppress the recombination of charge carriers (vide infra).61 However, when the amount of graphene further increased, the photocatalytic activity of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs decreased. This might be attributed to the increased light shielding effect imposed by excess graphene sheets on the surface of the hybrids.54,62,63 Based on these findings, we chose the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs prepared with 0.5 wt% GO as catalysts for subsequent photocatalysis studies.
To examine the synergism between the intimately coupled ternary constituents of our heteronanostructures in photocatalysis, the visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs was benchmarked against those of binary and single-component catalysts, such as AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, graphene-encapsulated anatase TiO2 NPs (G–TiO2 NPs), anatase TiO2 NPs (TiO2 NPs), a commercial TiO2 catalyst (P25), graphene nanosheets (NSs), and Au ONCs, as well as the physical mixtures of AuONC@TiO2 CSNs + graphene NSs and Au ONCs + G–TiO2 NPs. As mentioned above, the AuONC@TiO2 CSNs were prepared by the calcination of the AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs (Fig. S6†). For precise comparison, the TiO2 and G–TiO2 NPs were prepared with synthetic procedures identical to those employed in the production of the AuONC@TiO2 and G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, respectively, using Au core-removed AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs, which were generated by the wet etching of the AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs with KCN,64,65 instead of the AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs (Fig. S11 and S12†). EDS, XRD, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analyses confirmed the absence of Au in the TiO2 and G–TiO2 NPs. Graphene NSs were synthesized through the calcination of GO under the same experimental conditions used in the preparation of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs. The amounts of hydrogen evolved with the different catalysts are presented in Fig. 4a and corresponding hydrogen evolution rates are summarized in Fig. 4b. Remarkably, among the different catalysts, the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs exhibited the most pronounced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, whose hydrogen evolution rate, 676.56 μmol h−1 g−1, is 2.8, 13, 59, 46, 27, 2.1, and 3.8 times higher than that obtained with the AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, G–TiO2 NPs, TiO2 NPs, P25, graphene NSs, AuONC@TiO2 CSNs + graphene NSs mixture, and Au ONCs + G–TiO2 NPs mixture, respectively. Hydrogen evolution was not detected with the pristine Au ONCs, indicating that the TiO2 and graphene domains of the nanostructures act as active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction. These results confirm that the controlled integration of the ternary components, Au, TiO2, and graphene, to form heteronanostructured photocatalysts is desirable to achieve high solar energy conversion efficiency. The physical mixtures of AuONC@TiO2 CSNs + graphene NSs and Au ONCs + G–TiO2 NPs exhibited lower photocatalytic activity than the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, further suggesting that intimate contact both at the Au ONCs/TiO2 and TiO2/graphene interfaces is important for realizing the synergism between the constituents and thus superior photocatalytic activity. Notably, the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs showed recyclability for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and retained their structural integrity after repeated photocatalytic reactions (Fig. S13†).

(c) AQEs as a function of excitation wavelength and the extinction spectrum of G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs. (d) AQEs of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with different catalysts under 700 nm irradiation. 
To verify the effect of the plasmonic function of the heteronanostructures on the photocatalysis, we measured the apparent quantum efficiencies (AQEs) of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs for hydrogen evolution under monochromatic light irradiation from 450 to 800 nm (Fig. 4c). Evidently, the activity trend of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs was closely correlated with their extinction spectrum, corroborating that the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with the hybrids is indeed a plasmon-enhanced process, in which the plasmon energy of the Au cores is transferred to the adjacent TiO2. Furthermore, the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs showed considerable AQEs under red-light irradiation; an AQE value of 0.31% was obtained under 700 nm irradiation, which is higher than reported values attained with other Au–semiconductor hybrids (see Table S1†). This demonstrates that our structural design is promising for the development of red-light-responsive photocatalysts, which is in good accordance with the abovementioned inference.
To further explore the correlation between the configuration and red-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of the nanostructures, the AQE of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs under 700 nm irradiation was compared with those of the benchmark catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4d, the AQEs of the AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, mixture of AuONC@TiO2 CSNs + graphene NSs, and mixture of Au ONCs + G–TiO2 NPs under 700 nm irradiation were 0.10, 0.16, and 0.027%, respectively, while the other benchmark catalysts having no Au ONCs, such as the G–TiO2 NPs, TiO2 NPs, P25, and graphene NSs, did not exhibit any hydrogen evolution activity under 700 nm irradiation. Interestingly, the mixture of Au ONCs + G–TiO2 NPs showed lower relative photocatalytic activity under 700 nm irradiation than the other Au ONC-containing catalysts. These results imply that the core–shell engineering with TiO2 around Au ONC cores and intimate contact between them are supposed to be crucial to efficient red-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.
Promotional effects of Au ONCs and graphene on photocatalysis
Understanding the underlying mechanism of the photocatalysis with the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs is essential to elucidate the synergism between the constituent materials and thereby to the development of efficient solar energy conversion platforms. Given that the multi-component catalysts containing the Au ONCs, i.e., the G–AuONC@TiO2 and AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, exhibited higher hydrogen evolution activities than the TiO2 and graphene counterparts, such as the G–TiO2 and TiO2 NPs, the excitation of the LSPR of the Au ONCs under illumination is assumed to have a promotional effect on the photocatalysis. As mentioned previously, the plasmonic excitation of metal domains in metal–semiconductor heteronanostructures can increase the charge carrier density in the semiconductor and hence improve photocatalytic activity through plasmon energy transfer from the metal to the semiconductor along several pathways, including the scattering, HET, and PIRET processes.30–34 Among the possible routes for the transfer of plasmon energy, the scattering process, which is the radiative relaxation of LSPR excitation, is presumed to be inefficient for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs because anatase TiO2 counterparts only absorb light below about 400 nm and have a large band gap energy (Eg = 3.22 eV) that can hardly be excited by visible light (Fig. S14†).66,67 On the other hand, the contribution of the PIRET to the enhanced photocatalysis with the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs can be assumed to be negligible, as the PIRET process requires a considerable spectral overlap between the metal and semiconductor domains in heteronanostructures to form dipole–dipole coupling, which is difficult to achieve in the combination of Au and TiO2 as shown in Fig. 3d and S14.†34,67,68 Accordingly, we can infer that the HET process should be the principal mechanism for the promotional effect of the Au ONCs on the enhanced activity of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs. To corroborate our inference, G–AuONC@SiO2@TiO2 core–shell–shell nanostructures (CSSNs) containing 5–6 nm insulating SiO2 layers, which can block the injection of LSPR-induced hot electrons into TiO2, while allowing the other plasmon energy transfer pathways,30–33,68 were prepared and their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity was compared with that of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs (Fig. 5). The HAADF-STEM image, corresponding EDS elemental mapping images, EDS cross-sectional compositional line profiles, and XRD pattern of the prepared G–AuONC@SiO2@TiO2 CSSNs clearly show the existence of embedded SiO2 layers between Au ONC cores and TiO2 shells (Fig. 5d–f). Notably, as shown in Fig. 5g, the incorporation of insulating SiO2 layers led to a 93% decrease in photocatalytic activity (48.426 μmol h−1 g−1), which is similar to the hydrogen evolution rate of the G–TiO2 NPs, 51.147 μmol h−1 g−1. This distinctly demonstrates that the plasmon energy transfer in the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs under illumination proceeds predominantly through the HET process.

Apparently, the results of photocatalysis showed that the introduction of graphene into several nanostructures, such as the AuONC@TiO2 CSNs and TiO2 NPs, could improve their photocatalytic performance. Indeed, as graphene possesses a lower Fermi energy level (−0.08 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.29 V vs. NHE), the photogenerated electrons populated at the conduction band of TiO2 can be transferred to graphene, thus facilitating the migration and separation of excited charge carriers.27,69 To verify the inhibition of electron–hole pair recombination by graphene, the transient photocurrents of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, G–TiO2 NPs, and TiO2 NPs were measured under visible-light irradiation at 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl after depositing each catalyst on an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode (Fig. 6). Evidently, the G–AuONC@TiO2 and AuONC@TiO2 CSNs exhibited strong photocurrent responses for light irradiation compared to the G–TiO2 and TiO2 NPs due to the plasmon energy transfer of the Au ONC cores through the HET mechanism. Interestingly, the photocurrents of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs and G–TiO2 NPs, which are encapsulated with graphene, were 4.0 and 7.3 times higher than those of the AuONC@TiO2 CSNs and TiO2 NPs, respectively. The results of the photocurrent measurements, which are consistent with those of the photocatalysis, reveal that the graphene envelopes have a promotional influence on the enhancement of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs due to their capability for the space separation of charge carriers.

To further investigate the behavior of photoexcited charge carriers at the interface between TiO2 and graphene, photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed for the G–TiO2 NPs, TiO2 NPs, and TiO2 NPs + graphene NSs physical mixture under 375 nm excitation (Fig. 7). To prepare the physical mixture of TiO2 NPs and graphene NSs, the same amounts of amorphous TiO2 NPs and GO as those employed in the synthesis of the G–TiO2 NPs were separately calcined and mixed together. We selected the catalysts having no Au ONCs for PL analysis to clearly identify the effect of graphene on the behavior of charge carriers without the influence of the Au ONC cores. Emission bands, which can be assigned to the typical band edge emission of TiO2,70 were observed around 550 nm in the steady-state PL spectra of the nanostructures (Fig. 7a). Remarkably, the G–TiO2 NPs exhibited drastic quenching of PL emission compared to the TiO2 NPs and mixture of TiO2 NPs + graphene NSs, distinctly demonstrating the suppressed recombination of photogenerated charge carriers through the electron transfer from TiO2 to intimately coupled graphene.69 A slight decrease in the PL emission of the mixture of TiO2 NPs + graphene NSs in comparison to the TiO2 NPs might be attributed to charge migration by temporal physical contact between the TiO2 NPs and graphene NSs.25,27 In addition, time-resolved PL decay curves (Fig. 7b) and corresponding PL lifetimes (Table S2†) of the catalysts indicate that the charge carrier lifetime of the G–TiO2 NPs is much more elongated than those of the TiO2 NPs and TiO2 NPs + graphene NSs due to the interfacial charge transfer.71 The steady-state PL spectra of the hybrids containing the Au ONCs, such as the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, and G–AuONC@SiO2@TiO2@ CSSNs, are shown in Fig. S15.† Significant quenching of PL emission was observed for the G–AuONC@TiO2 and AuONC@TiO2 CSNs in comparison to their G–TiO2 and TiO2 NP counterparts, respectively. In contrast, the PL intensity of the G–AuONC@SiO2@TiO2@ CSSNs was similar to that of the G–TiO2 NPs.

Based on the above results and findings, we can propose an underpinning mechanism for the plasmon-enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs as illustrated in Fig. 8. Upon visible-light irradiation, the LSPR of the Au ONC cores is excited and then relaxed to generate hot electrons and holes. The plasmon-induced hot electrons in the Au ONC cores are then injected into the conduction band of TiO2. These accumulated electrons can react with H+ to produce hydrogen as well as recombine with the holes present in the Au ONC cores.72,73 However, the graphene envelopes can effectively prevent the charge recombination by accepting excess electrons from TiO2.22–25 The electrons transferred from the TiO2 shells to the graphene envelopes can also involve in the hydrogen evolution reaction. Indeed, the abovementioned migration of photogenerated electrons is feasible thanks to the intimate contact between the ternary constituents of the G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs. On the other hand, the photogenerated holes in the Au ONC cores can be consumed by the oxidation of the hole scavenger, methanol, transported to the inner Au ONC cores through the mesoporous TiO2 shells.

Conclusions
We have devised a synthetic strategy for the production of hierarchical ternary heteronanostructures consisting of plasmonic metal nanocrystals, a semiconductor, and graphene with a controlled configuration for plasmon-enhanced wide-range visible-light photocatalysis. Graphene-encapsulated (octahedral Au nanocrystals)@(anatase TiO2) core–shell nanostructures were successfully generated via sequential sol–gel, self-assembly, and post-calcination processes using octahedral Au nanocrystals as starting materials. The proposed synthesis approach could enable intimate contact and thus strong interaction between the constituent materials. The ternary heteronanostructures exhibited superior photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution under visible-light (λ > 400 nm) irradiation including the red-light region over their binary counterparts, single-component catalysts, and the physical mixtures of the constituents due to the synergistic integration of the plasmon energy transfer of the Au cores via the hot electron transfer mechanism and the expedited migration of photogenerated electrons through graphene. The intimate contact at the interfaces between the constituents of the ternary heteronanostructures allows the above synergism between the different materials. We expect that our approach can be applied to the design of a new class of heteronanostructures for efficient solar energy conversion.

Synthesis of GO
GO was synthesized from graphite powder using a modified Hummers' method.49–51 In a typical synthesis of GO, 1.0 g of graphite powder, 0.5 g of NaNO3, and 30 mL of H2SO4 were mixed in a vial with vigorous stirring in an ice bath. Then, 5 g of KMnO4 was added slowly to the mixture and the resultant reaction mixture was transferred to a water bath and stored for 2 h at 35 °C with stirring. Next, 40 mL of water was added slowly to the mixture and the resultant reaction mixture was cooled down in the ice bath for 1 h. After the reaction mixture was transferred to the water bath at 35 °C, another 100 mL of water was added to the mixture and then H2O2 was added until the color of the mixture changed from dark brown to yellow. The synthesized GO mixture was filtered using a Buchner funnel and washed with 10% HCl solution and water several times. The filter cake was dried in a desiccator and redispersed in water.
Synthesis of Au ONCs
Au ONCs were synthesized by following a reported method with slight modification.74 An aqueous CTAB solution (0.01 M, 1000 mL) was kept at 50 °C for 1 h. Then, HAuCl4·3H2O (0.01 M, 12.5 mL), AA (0.1 M, 5 mL), and NaOH (0.1 M, 1.25 mL) were sequentially added to the reaction solution with gentle shaking. The resultant mixture was kept at 50 °C again for 2.5 h.
Synthesis of AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs
AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs were prepared according to a reported protocol with slight modification.48 First, 50 mL of the Au ONC solution was washed by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min. Then, the purified solution of Au ONCs (50 mL) was added to an aqueous solution of PSS (2 mg mL−1, 50 mL) containing 6 mM NaCl with vigorous stirring. After the ligand exchange reaction overnight, the resultant solution was washed by centrifugation to remove excess PSS and then concentrated to 1 mL of water. For TiO2 hydrolysis, 1 mL of TiCl3 solution was added to 30 mL of water and then NaHCO3 solution (1.00565 M, 3.375 mL) was injected into the solution by drop casting. After the color of the resultant mixture changed from purple to black, the concentrated Au ONC solution (1 mL) was added to the mixture immediately. The resultant reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min and washed twice by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min with pure ethanol.
Synthesis of G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs
To synthesize G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, the as-prepared AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs were re-dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol. Then, this solution was injected into 0.5 mL of APTMS and stirred for 4 h at 70 °C. The resultant mixture was washed several times with ethanol by centrifugation at 11000 rpm for 10 min, and re-dispersed in 20 mL of water. To encapsulate GO on the surface of APTMS-modified AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs, 0.175, 0.35, 0.525 or 0.7 mL (0.25, 0.5, 1 or 2 wt%) of GO suspension (0.2 mg mL−1) was added to the solution at pH 6. After vigorous stirring for 30 min, the mixture was collected by centrifugation and then dried in a Pyrex test tube. To crystallize TiO2 and reduce GO simultaneously, calcination at 450 °C was carried out for 8 h with an Ar flow.
Au etching of AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs and synthesis of TiO2 and G–TiO2 NPs
To etch out Au ONC cores in AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs, an aqueous KCN solution (1 M, 8 mL) was mixed with 20 mL of AuONC@aTiO2 CSN ethanol solution and stirred at 400 rpm for 3 h. The resultant amorphous TiO2 NPs were washed by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min and re-dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol. To prepare TiO2 NPs, the calcination process identical to that employed in the synthesis of G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs was carried out for amorphous TiO2 NPs. In a typical synthesis of G–TiO2 NPs, sequential APTMS functionalization, GO encapsulation, and calcination of amorphous TiO2 NPs were conducted using the experimental procedures identical to those employed in the preparation of G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs.
Synthesis of AuONC@SiO2 CSNs
AuONC@SiO2 CSNs were prepared by following reported protocols with slight modification.30–32,75,76 First, 100 mL of the Au ONC solution was washed by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min with water and re-dispersed in 25 mL of water. Then, this solution was mixed with 0.5 mL of an aqueous solution of APTMS (10 mM) and stirred for 1 h. To this reaction solution was added 0.5 mL of an aqueous sodium silicate solution (5.4 wt%, pH = 10–11), which was prepared by mixing 0.777 mL of sodium silicate solution, 0.01 mL of ammonia solution, and 19.213 mL of water. The resultant solution was heated at 90 °C for 1 h in a preheated oil bath. The prepared AuONC@SiO2 CSNs were washed twice with water by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min and stored in 50 mL of water.
Synthesis of G–AuONC@SiO2@TiO2 CSSNs
In a typical synthesis of G–AuONC@SiO2@TiO2 CSSNs, the AuONC@SiO2 CSN solution (50 mL) was injected into an aqueous PSS solution (2 mg mL−1, 50 mL) containing 6 mM NaCl and stirred overnight. The resultant solution was concentrated to 1 mL of water by centrifugation. The reaction solution was added immediately to a mixture of TiCl3 solution (0.75 mL), water (30 mL), and NaHCO3 solution (1.00565 M, 6.75 mL) to yield AuONC@SiO2@amorphous TiO2 CSSNs. To prepare G–AuONC@SiO2@TiO2 CSSNs, the resultant mixture was washed twice by centrifugation and re-dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol. The subsequent APTMS functionalization, GO encapsulation, and calcination processes were identical to those employed in the preparation of G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs.
Characterization
SEM images were collected using a Magellan 400 field emission scanning electron microscope (FEI). TEM and HAADF-STEM-EDS mapping images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-ARM200F Cs-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV and a Phillips Tecnai G2 F30 Super-Twin field-emission transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV, after placing a drop of nanostructure solutions on a carbon-coated Cu grid (300 mesh). XRD patterns were obtained with RIGAKU D/MAX-2500 and Ultima IV thin-film X-ray diffractometers. Atomic force microscopy was carried out in air at room temperature with a Park System XE-100 scanning probe microscope. XPS measurements were carried out using a Sigma Probe spectrometer (Thermo VG Scientific) with Al Kα X-rays (1486.6 eV) as the light source. The XPS binding energy was calibrated with respect to the peak position of C 1s at 284.5 eV. FTIR spectra were obtained by using a Cary-660 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. Extinction spectra and diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrometer with an ISR-3100 integrating sphere attachment. Elemental analysis was conducted with an Agilent ICP-OES 720. The transient photocurrent curves were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, 660C) in a standard three-electrode cell under visible-light irradiation by using a Xe lamp (300 W, Newport 66902) equipped with a UV-cutoff filter (Kenko L-42, λ > 400 nm). The power density of the light source was 150 mW cm−2. The working electrode was prepared through the uniform dispersion of nanostructures (0.2 mg) onto an ITO glass with an active area of 10 cm2. The working electrode was immersed in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution with a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively, under an applied bias of 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. PL measurements were carried out with an Edinburgh Instruments FL920 spectrometer.
Photocatalysis
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions were performed under visible-light irradiation (λ > 400 nm, 150 mW cm−2) by using a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a UV-cutoff filter. In a typical photocatalysis, 4.0 mg of catalysts was dispersed in 8.0 mL of an aqueous solution containing sacrificial hole scavengers (25 vol%) in a quartz cell with a volume of 16 mL. The reaction solution was purged with Ar gas for 45 min to accomplish anaerobic conditions, and then the reaction cell was sealed with a silicone rubber septum. The amount of hydrogen evolved was measured by gas chromatography (GC) using an Agilent 7890A GC system coupled to an Agilent 5975C inert XL MSD with a triple axis detector with a Carboxen 1000 packed column. For the photocatalysis under monochromatic light irradiation, 10.0 mg of catalysts was dispersed in 40.0 mL of an aqueous solution containing methanol (25 vol%) in a reaction cell, a quartz cuvette with a volume of 100 mL. The power density of the light source was 5 mW cm−2 and the excitation wavelength was modulated using band pass filters with center wavelengths of 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, and 800 nm (full width at half maximum = 10 ± 2 nm).

 	Fig. 2  (a) High-magnification TEM and (b) HRTEM images of G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs. (c) HAADF-STEM image and corresponding EDS elemental mapping images of a G–AuONC@TiO2 CSN. (d) EDS compositional line scanning profiles along the direction marked with a yellow arrow in the HAADF-STEM image of a G–AuONC@TiO2 CSN shown in the inset. (e) XRD pattern of G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs. The positions of Au and anatase TiO2 references were taken from the JCPDS database (Au: 65-2870, anatase TiO2: 21-1272).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Ti 2p XPS and (b) FTIR spectra of G–AuONC@TiO2 and AuONC@TiO2 CSNs. (c) Au 4f XPS of G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs and Au ONCs. (d) Extinction spectra of G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs, GO–AuONC@aTiO2 CSNs, and Au ONCs.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Amounts of hydrogen evolved during the photocatalysis under visible-light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) with different catalysts, which are normalized to the total mass of catalysts, and (b) corresponding hydrogen evolution rates. (c) AQEs as a function of excitation wavelength and the extinction spectrum of G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs. (d) AQEs of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with different catalysts under 700 nm irradiation.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) TEM image of AuONC@SiO2 CSNs. The high-magnification TEM image of an AuONC@SiO2 CSN with an arrow denoting the SiO2 layer is shown in the inset. (b) TEM and (c) HRTEM images of G–AuONC@SiO2@TiO2 CSSNs. (d) HAADF-STEM image and corresponding EDS elemental mapping images of a G–AuONC@SiO2@TiO2 CSSN. (e) EDS compositional line scanning profiles along the direction marked with a yellow arrow in the HAADF-STEM image of a G–AuONC@SiO2@TiO2 CSSN shown in the inset. (f) XRD pattern of G–AuONC@SiO2@TiO2 CSSNs. A broad feature at the low 2θ side of the XRD pattern is attributed to the SiO2 layer. (g) Comparison of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity between G–AuONC@TiO2 CSNs and G–AuONC@SiO2@TiO2 CSSNs.
