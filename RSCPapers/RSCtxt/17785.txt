    , Accepted 14th November 2015First published on 17th November 2015AbstractWe developed a facile strategy for the fabrication of uniform Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes with an adjustable Au loading content using ZnSn(OH)6 as the precursor, chloroauric acid as the Au source and ascorbic acid as the reducing agent. The Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes show enhanced light absorption ability and reduced recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs compared with pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2. The hollow rounded cube structured Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 sample displays a high surface area and high dye adsorption ability. As photoanodes for DSSCs, the Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes demonstrate a greatly enhanced Jsc and an improved power conversion efficiency of up to 2.04%, almost 73% higher compared to the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2 based DSSCs. The greatly improved power conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on the Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 photoanode can be attributed to the following three factors. Firstly, the localized surface plasmon resonance of Au nanoparticles plays a crucial role in the enhancement of visible light absorption. Secondly, the potential barrier on the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 surface caused by Au nanoparticles can suppress electron–hole recombination, diminish the loss of electrons during the transfer process and improve the photocurrent density. Thirdly, the enhanced photovoltaic performance can also be attributed to the unique structural characteristics of hollow rounded cubes.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been of great interest due to their low cost, relatively high power conversion efficiency, and their unique advantages over conventional silicon photovoltaic devices since the great breakthrough work by O'Regan and Gratzel in 1991.1 During the past decades, considerable studies on novel photoanodes,2–5 electrolytes,6–8 and sensitizers9–11 have been performed to improve the photovoltaic conversion efficiency and long-term stability of DSSCs.12 The photoelectrode is one of the most important components in DSSCs, which is normally comprised of mesoporous wide-band-gap oxide semiconductor films with a high internal surface area. Thus far, the majority of published studies have been focused on photoanodes based on binary metal oxides such as TiO2,1,3–5 ZnO13,14 and SnO2.15,16 Among them, TiO2 based DSSCs have been predominantly investigated and comprehensively employed owing to their high power conversion efficiency and low preparation costs.4,5 However, it has been shown that TiO2 photoanodes could cause photobleaching of dye molecules in the UV region of the solar spectrum,17,18 which is a major obstacle for their long-term practical applications. Alternatively, compared with simple binary materials, ternary metal oxides such as Zn2SnO4, BaSnO3 and SrTiO3 offer several advantages on certain aspects.19–21 Among multifarious ternary metal oxides, Zn2SnO4 (ZTO) has been reported to possess a band-gap of 3.6 eV and a high electron mobility of 10–15 cm2 V−1 s−1,22,23 superior to that of TiO2 (0.1–1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1).24 In addition, it can diminish photobleaching and maintain long-term stability due to its wide band-gap and large band-to-band transition.25 In the first report on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs based on Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles in 2007,26 a superior power conversion efficiency was exhibited, which was close to the highest efficiency for ZnO fabricated under similar conditions. Subsequently, particular interest was focused on investigations based on different morphologies of Zn2SnO4, such as nanowires,27 nanoplates28 and nanotubes.29 Some other methods such as doping and quantum dot sensitization are also investigated to improve the power conversion efficiency of Zn2SnO4 photovoltaic devices.30–33 However, insufficient visible light absorption due to its wide band-gap of 3.6 eV and high recombination rate of electrons and holes still hinder the improvement of the photovoltaic performance of Zn2SnO4 based DSSCs.
Recently, compositing different semiconductor materials to form a heterojunction structure to suppress the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs has been an effective route to improve the photo-electrical conversion efficiency and optoelectronic performance. So far, Zn2SnO4/TiO2 and Zn2SnO4/ZnO composite heterostructures have been reported to show a superior photovoltaic performance compared to pure Zn2SnO4.28,34 With a high electron mobility of 100–200 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the same band-gap of 3.6 eV as that of Zn2SnO4, SnO2 is also considered to be an ideal photocatalytic and DSSC material to be used widely.35–37 Li et al.38 reported DSSCs based on the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 composite, demonstrating that the conduction band (CB) of SnO2 is lower than that of counterpart Zn2SnO4, achieving a 43% photovoltaic conversion efficiency enhancement compared with pure Zn2SnO4. Liu et al.39 investigated the photocatalytic performance based on Zn2SnO4/SnO2, revealing a much higher activity under solar light illumination than pure Zn2SnO4.
Recently, it is worth noting that the improvement in the poor absorption of visible light can be realized by employing Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) of noble metal nanoparticles in DSSCs.40–42 By proper deposition of metal nanoparticles into the electrode, light can be efficiently trapped and concentrated, resulting in the significant enhancement of optical absorption and photocurrent.43 Li et al.44 designed a nanocomposite with Au nanoparticles inlaid in TiO2 as the working electrode, displaying a photocurrent and power conversion efficiency increase by 63% and 84%, respectively. Qi et al.45 fabricated an Ag@TiO2 core–shell nanostructure, achieving a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 9.0% with reduced photoanode thickness for better electron collection. In addition to enhancing light harvesting, the recombination rate of photo-generated charges of the metal nanoparticle coupled semiconductor can be diminished by constituting a Schottky barrier in the interfacial region of novel metal nanoparticles and semiconductors, as demonstrated in McFarland's work.46 When an electron in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the dye tunnels is transferred to the conduction band of the semiconductor via the Au nanoparticle, it is unlikely to go back to either the dye or the electrolyte due to the presence of the Schottky barrier. However, until now, few studies have been reported on DSSCs based on ternary oxide added with novel metal nanoparticles.
For improving the visible light harvesting effect to achieve enhanced performance of DSSCs, besides the incorporation of novel metal nanoparticles, an alternative route is to make a rational microstructure design. Hollow micro/nanostructured materials have drawn growing attention owing to their high surface area to absorb dye molecules, endowing them with great potential for applications in DSSCs based on different materials such as TiO2,47,48 SnO249,50 and ZnO.51,52 Despite various studies on DSSCs based on hollow structures so far, the light scattering effect and packing density of the spherical structure are still not very sufficient due to the point-to-point contact of spherical particles.47–51 It is reported that non-spherical hollow particles, such as nanocubes and nanoboxes, can exhibit unusual physical/chemical properties. For instance, single-/double-wall Fe(OH)x nanoboxes and CeO2 nanocubes with an average size of ∼400 nm as photoanodes for DSSCs, exhibit remarkable improvement in light absorption ability and photoelectrical conversion performance.53,54
In this study, we develop a facile strategy for the fabrication of uniform Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes with an adjustable Au loading content using ZnSn(OH)6 as the precursor, chloroauric acid as the Au source and ascorbic acid as the reducing agent. The structure and morphology of Zn2SnO4/SnO2 can be tuned by adjusting the concentration of NaOH, and a homogeneous deposition of Au nanoparticles on the surface of Zn2SnO4/SnO2 can be realized via adjusting the pH value. The Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes show enhanced light absorption ability and reduced recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs compared with pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2. The enhanced photovoltaic performance and related mechanism of DSSCs based on Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes are evaluated. As photoanodes for DSSCs, the Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes demonstrate a greatly enhanced Jsc and an improved power conversion efficiency of up to 2.04%, almost 73% higher than that of DSSCs based on Zn2SnO4/SnO2. The relationship between the microstructure, optical response property, electron transfer and photovoltaic performance is discussed and analyzed.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of Au nanoparticle inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes

2.1.1 Synthesis of Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes. 
First, a typical precursor of ZnSn(OH)6 hollow rounded cubes were synthesized through an inlaid self-templating co-precipitation method.55 30 mL of ethanol solution of SnCl4 (6 mmol) was added into 60 mL of an aqueous solution mixture containing ZnCl2 (6 mmol) and citric acid (6 mmol) under stirring, followed by quick addition of 72 mmol of NaOH and 150 mL of deionized water. After 10 min, 120 mL of aqueous solution of NaOH (2 M) was poured into the suspension and the reaction lasted for another 10 min. The resulting white precipitates were collected by several rinse–centrifugation cycles with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C. Then the as-prepared ZnSn(OH)6 hollow rounded cubes were annealed at 800 °C in air for 6 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1, resulting in a white product of Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes.


2.1.2 Fabrication of Au nanoparticle inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes. 
Typically, the obtained Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes (0.2 g) were dispersed in 150 mL aqueous solution containing 40 mg of PVP and 70 mg of ascorbic acid. This mixture was heated to 90 °C under constant stirring and the pH value was adjusted to around 7. After 30 min, 50 mL of 1 mM AuCl4−(aq) solution was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 12 h under constant stirring. After the reaction, the resultant products were centrifuged, thoroughly washed with deionized water and ethanol, and dried at 60 °C. Corresponding to an adjustable Au/(Zn2SnO4/SnO2) mass ratio of 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% according to the initial amount of raw materials, the prepared Au nanoparticle inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 composites are denoted as AZS0, AZS1, AZS2, AZS3 and AZS4 samples, respectively.

2.2 Solar cell fabrication

2.2.1 Preparation of Au nanoparticle inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cube photoanodes. 
To prepare the photoanodes of Au nanoparticle inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes, fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as a transparent conducting glass was cleaned by sonication in soapy water, acetone and ethanol for 20 min, respectively. Firstly, the blocking layer solution was created by treating with an aqueous solution of TiCl4 (40 mM) at 60 °C for 15 min to restrain interfacial recombination of electrons in the highly conducting FTO and the I3− oxidized electrolyte.56 Secondly, a layer of photoanode paste was spin-coated onto the FTO glass plates by the spin coating method at a speed of 2000 rpm for 30 seconds. The thickness of the photoanode is about 10 μm obtained by repetitive spinning several times.57


2.2.2 Fabrication of DSSCs. 
The annealed electrodes were sensitized by immersing into a 5 × 10−4 M N719 (cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutyl-ammonium)) dye solution dissolved in equal volumes of acetonitrile (Aladdin-reagent, China) and tert-butanol (Aladdin-reagent, China) at ambient temperature for 24 h, followed by washing with acetonitrile to remove the non-chemisorbed dye, and dried before being assembled in solar cells. The Pt counter electrodes were prepared by coating with a drop of 0.01 M H2PtCl6 ethanol solution on the cleaned FTO glass and sintered at 400 °C for 15 min. The two electrodes were thermally sealed together with a 25 μm thick Surlyn polymer seal (Surlyn, DuPont) into a sandwich type cell. The electrolyte (electrolyte of 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.05 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in a (85:15 vol%) mixture of acetonitrile (Aladdin-reagent, China) and valeronitrile (Aladdin-reagent, China)) was injected through a hole in the counter electrode of the assembled cell and driven into the cell via vacuum backfilling. The hole was sealed using another piece of slide glass-backed Surlyn.

2.3 Characterization
The composition and crystal structure of the obtained nanocrystals were examined with an X-ray diffractometer (Philips Rigaku D/Max-kA X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα source at 40 kV and 30 mA). The surface morphology of the as-prepared samples was analyzed by SU-70 field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The detailed microstructure of the synthesized product was analyzed by using a Phillips Tecnai 20U-Twin high-resolution transmission electron microscope attached to an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The surface area of the samples was evaluated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using N2 physisorption analysis at 77 K with a Gold APP V-Sorb 2800P. Porosity distributions were calculated from the adsorption branch of the isotherm using the corrected form of the Kelvin equation by means of the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. Prior to physisorption, the samples were degassed at 160 °C under vacuum for 3 h.
Diffused reflection spectra were measured on a TU-1901 spectro-photometer with an integrating sphere detector. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded using a conventional spectrometer (Cary-50 Varian Co.). Current–voltage characteristics under simulated AM 1.5 illumination were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Class 3A, 94023A) at one sun (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) by using a Keithley 2420 source meter, and the light intensity was measured using a calibrated Si solar cell (certificated by NREL). The photoactive area of 0.16 cm2 was defined by a black metal mask slightly larger than the active area to cut off stray light.58 The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using a Princeton Parstate 2273A in a two-electrode design; the photoanode served as a working electrode and the Pt-coated on FTO as a counter electrode at an applied bias of the open circuit voltage under one-sun irradiation. The frequency range of 100 mHz to 100 kHz with an AC voltage magnitude of 10 mV. The EIS data were analyzed with an appropriate equivalent circuit using simulation software.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology characterization

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (a) and Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 with different Au loadings: (b) 0.5 wt%, (c) 1 wt%, (d) 2 wt% (e) 3 wt% and (f) 4 wt%. From the XRD patterns of pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2 and Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2, the peaks located at 17.7°, 29.2°, 34.3°, 41.7°, 55.1° and 60.5° can be observed distinctly in all patterns, in good agreement with (111), (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440) planes of inverse-spinal Zn2SnO4 (JCPDS 24-1470), respectively. The peaks at 26.4°, 33.7°, and 51.6° correspond well to (110), (101) and (211) planes of tetragonal retile SnO2 (JCPDS 41-1445), respectively. Compared with the XRD patterns of pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2 samples, three additional peaks in the XRD pattern of Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 are observed at 38.1°, 44.4°, 64.5° (Fig. 1b–d), corresponding well to (111), (200), (220) planes of cubic Au, respectively (JCPDS 04-0784). Furthermore, with increasing loading amount of Au (from 0.5 wt% to 4 wt%), the intensity of diffraction peaks at 38.1°, 44.4°, 64.5° increases gradually (Fig. 1b–f).

For the growth of Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes, it is found that the concentration of NaOH plays an essential role in the morphologies of precursor ZnSn(OH)6. Fig. S1† displays the SEM images of precursor ZnSn(OH)6 prepared under different concentrations of NaOH. When the amount of NaOH is 60 mmol, the morphology of the obtained precursor ZnSn(OH)6 is cube-like and uniform (Fig. S1a†). The high SEM image in Fig. S1b† reveals a well-defined cube-shaped structure with a side length of 0.7 μm. With increasing concentration of NaOH, the morphology of ZnSn(OH)6 evolves into rounded cubes and the length of sides increases to 1.2 μm (Fig. S1d and f†). When the amount of NaOH increases to 78 mmol, it can be seen from Fig. S1g and f† that the products become uniform quasi-spheres with a diameter of 1.5 μm.

Fig. 2 depicts SEM images of pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes annealed at 800 °C (ZS) and Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes inlaid by 2% Au nanoparticles (AZS2). From the SEM images in Fig. 2a and b, it can be clearly seen that the obtained Zn2SnO4/SnO2 samples are composed of uniform rounded cubes with a side length of 1.2 μm. Moreover, the high-resolution SEM images in Fig. 2b suggest that the structure of prepared rounded cubes is hollow in nature. After loading of Au nanoparticles (Fig. 2c and d), both the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cube shape and monodisperse size distribution are maintained, and deposition of Au nanoparticles on the surface of Zn2SnO4/SnO2 is uniform (no significant aggregation at the surface is detected). Fig. S2† is the cross-sectional image of the photoanode of Zn2SnO4/SnO2 after absorbing dye N719. The thickness of the photoanode film shown in Fig. S2† is around 12 μm.

The microstructure of Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes (AZS2) are further investigated by TEM. Fig. 3a–c depict low- and high-magnification TEM images of the AZS2, confirming that the hollow rounded cubes are composed of nanoparticles with a size of about 40 nm and are highly porous. In addition, the high-magnification TEM image in Fig. 3c further demonstrates that Au nanoparticles disperse uniformly on the surface of Zn2SnO4/SnO2. The HRTEM lattice image in Fig. 3d suggests the coexistence of three kinds of phases of Zn2SnO4, SnO2 and Au. Fig. 3e depicts the HRTEM lattice image of Au nanoparticles, suggesting that the diameter of Au nanoparticles is estimated to be around 10 nm, and two sets of lattice spacing of 0.23 nm and 0.20 nm correspond well to the d-spacing of (111) and (200) planes of cubic Au, respectively (JCPDS 04-0784). The electron diffraction (ED) pattern reveals the phase components of the AZS2 samples (Fig. 3f), the diffraction rings correspond well to that of (111), (220) and (400) planes of inverse-spinel Zn2SnO4, and (110), (101) and (211) planes of tetragonal rutile SnO2, respectively. While the diffraction ring of the (111) plane of cubic Au is also depicted in Fig. 3f.

In order to further investigate the distribution information of Au nanoparticles, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping analysis is performed on the AZS2 samples. The EDS elemental mapping images in Fig. 4 show the presence of O, Zn, Sn and Au elements distributed throughout the sample, demonstrating the coverage of Au nanoparticles over the entire surface of Zn2SnO4/SnO2. It is worth mentioning that the dispersion of Au nanoparticles is uniform, and no aggregation of Au nanoparticles is observed in Fig. 4d.

The nitrogen absorption–desorption isotherms depicted in Fig. 5 are utilized to characterize the textural properties of the specific surface area, pore size distribution and pore volume of pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes (ZS) and Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes inlaid with various contents of Au nanoparticles (AZS0, AZS1, AZS2, AZS3 and AZS4). As shown in Fig. 5a, all samples display the isotherm with a smooth capillary condensation step occurred at a relative pressure of (P/P0 ≈ 0.9–1.0) and H3 type hysteresis loops, indicating their relatively large pore size and large specific surface area. An estimate of the mean pore size can be obtained from 4V/A, where V is the total pore volume and A is the specific area. The mean size of pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (ZS) and Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (AZS0, AZS1, AZS2, AZS3 and AZS4) is around 30 nm. Textural properties including the surface area, pore size and pore volume of all samples are listed in Table 1. With an increase in the Au deposition content, the surface area increases slightly from 11.59 m2 g−1 for ZS to 21.24 m2 g−1 for AZS4, and the pore size and pore volume decrease from 38.33 nm and 0.377 cm3 g−1 for ZS to 24.4 nm and 0.113 cm3 g−1 for AZS2 owing to the Au nanoparticles deposited on the surface and interior of the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow structure. It is generally accepted that the UV absorption and electron mobility are related to the specific area. A large specific surface area can facilitate electron transfer and provide a sufficient absorption amount of dye molecules, which results in enhanced photovoltaic performance.59,60

3.2 Optical property characterization

Fig. 6 shows the UV-vis diffusion reflection spectra (DRS) of pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (ZS) and Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (AZS0, AZS1, AZS2, AZS3 and AZS4). The DRS of pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (ZS) shows a strong diffusion reflection of light over 400–700 nm and drops suddenly in the range of 300–400 nm, indicating that the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 composite displays a wide-band-gap and nearly no absorption in the range of visible light. After being inlaid with different contents of Au nanoparticles, the diffusion reflection spectra decrease significantly compared with that of ZS and show an obvious decrease at about 550 nm, in good correspondence with the LSPR characterization of Au nanoparticles.61 The evolution of diffusion reflection spectra can be attributed to the inducement of the LSPR effect of Au nanoparticles to the absorption in visible light. Moreover, with increasing Au content, the LSPR effect is more enhanced, as shown in Fig. 6 (AZS0, AZS1 and AZS2). Whereas, the UV-vis diffusion reflection for AZS3 and AZS4 does not increase compared with AZS2, indicating that the LSPR effect has reached its limit. The UV-vis diffusion reflection spectra confirm that Au nanoparticles play a significant role in enhancing the visible light absorption for a wide-band-gap semiconductor material of Zn2SnO4/SnO2. The surface plasmonic resonance induced by Au nanoparticles can cause strong local field enhancement around Au nanoparticles, which can increase the light absorption of the surrounding dye molecules in a dye-loaded film. Therefore, enhancement of the light harvesting efficiency and hence the photocurrent of a DSSC can be expected using such Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 photoanodes.
 Fig. 6  DRS spectra of ZS, AZS0, AZS1, AZS2, AZS3 and AZS4 samples. 
Photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra are used to investigate the effect of the Au nanoparticles on the properties of charge carrier trapping, immigration and transfer, as well as to understand the fate of photo-generated electron–hole pairs in the Au laid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 composite. Fig. 7 shows the PL emission spectra of pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (ZS) and Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (AZS0, AZS1, AZS2, AZS3 and AZS4) at room temperature. The PL emission spectra of ZS, AZS0, AZS1, AZS2, AZS3 and AZS4 are obtained by using a spectrophotometer containing a xenon lamp with 350 nm excitation wavelengths. The energy of the excitation light is enough to promote electronic transition from the valence band to the conducting band of these four samples according to the above DRS (Fig. 6). All samples show two characteristic emission peaks at around 470 nm and 560 nm in the PL emission. The band-gaps of Zn2SnO4 and SnO2 are all 3.6 eV. Because of the limit of the PL detection range, the band-to-band emission peak (≈340 nm) of the Zn2SnO4 and SnO2 is not observed. For the PL mechanism of Zn2SnO4 and SnO2, it is considered to be attributed to other luminescence centers, such as oxygen deficiency and surface states during the growth process. Su et al.62 reported the optical properties of single-crystalline Zn2SnO4 nanowires synthesized by the thermal evaporation route, demonstrating that the PL of the nanowires displays a strong green emission band at 580 nm. Wang's.63 study suggests that Zn2SnO4 nanobelts show a broad blue-green PL emission around 400–600 nm with a maximum at 490 nm. In the present work, the peaks at 470 nm and 560 nm may be attributed to the oxygen deficiency of Zn2SnO4 and SnO2.
 Fig. 7  PL spectra of ZS, AZS0, AZS1, AZS2, AZS3 and AZS4 samples. 
For AZS0, AZS1, AZS2 and AZS3 in Fig. 7, the decrease of PL intensity of the emission peaks indicates that the presence of Au can suppress the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs.52 In addition, the intensity of emission peaks depends on the concentration of Au. 0.5 wt% Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (AZS0) shows a similar PL peak to pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2, indicating that the effect of contents of trace Au to inhibit recombination of photo-induced electron–hole pairs is not significant. However, with the increase of the amount of Au to 1 wt% (AZS1), the intensity of the emission peak decreases markedly compared with that of ZS and AZS0, demonstrating that Au nanoparticles play a key role in suppressing the recombination rate of photo-induced electron–hole pairs. When the concentration of Au is up to 4%, the PL peak increases sharply. The high Au content (4 wt%) may inhibit recombination to a certain extent, this is because a high Au incorporation may create some new electron–hole pair recombination centers, which could counteract its positive effect on the restraint of the recombination of electron–hole pairs.
The mechanism of Au nanoparticles to inhibit the recombination rate of photo-induced electron–hole pairs can be illustrated by the energy band-gap model of Scheme 1. Owing to the flowing of electrons from the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 composite to Au nanoparticles, the negative charge at the surface of Au and the positive charge on the surface of the semiconductor both increase, which causes the space charge region formation at the interface between Au nanoparticles and the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 composite. Therefore, an electric field emerges in the space charge region, leading to bending of the energy band, and ultimately, a surface potential of Vs generates between the surface and interior of Zn2SnO4/SnO2. The barrier height in the semiconductor can be expressed as: qVD = −qVs = Wm − Ws(1)and the barrier height in Au can be expressed as: qϕns = qVD + En = −qVs + En = Wm − Ws(2)in which Vs is the surface potential between the surface and interior of Zn2SnO4/SnO2, Wm is the work function of the metal defined as the difference between the Fermi level and vacuum level, Ws is the work function of the semiconductor, and En is the difference between the Fermi level and bottom of the conduction band for the semiconductor. When an electron is excited from the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 composite, it is unlikely to go back due to the presence of this barrier.

3.3 Performance of solar cells

3.3.1 Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curve analysis. 
The photocurrent density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of DSSCs based on N719 sensitized pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2 and Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 with different Au loading contents are measured under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Fig. 8 shows the J–V curves for each single DSSCs and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2, indicating that the incorporation of Au nanoparticles plays a significant role in the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. For DSSCs based on Zn2SnO4/SnO2, the open-circuit voltage is 674 mV and short-circuit photocurrent density is 2.64 mA cm−2. The power conversion efficiency measured is 1.18%. After loading with Au nanoparticles, Voc depicts an obvious decrease to 587 mV, while Jsc shows a significant increase to 4.04 mA cm−2. With the increase of the Au incorporation content ranging from 0.5% to 2%, the short-circuit photocurrent of Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 increases from 4.04 mA cm−2 (Au 0.5%) to 5.88 mA cm−2 (Au 2%). Similarly, Voc always maintains an increasing trend and is measured to be 600 mV as the Au content reaches 2%. The fill factor (FF) shows a slight declining trend with the increase of Au concentration except for AZS1. It is worth noting that the dye concentration is 34.41 nmol cm−2 for ZS, and it displays a slight increase to 43.23 for AZS2, which indicates that the increased surface area of Zn2SnO4/SnO2 is a direct consequence of enhanced dye loading capacity. The eventual photovoltaic conversion efficiency reaches 2.04% for 2% Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2, which is 73% higher compared to that of pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2 based DSSCs. However, with increasing Au concentration to 4%, the current density and photovoltaic conversion efficiency display a slight decrease (5.29 mA cm−2 and 1.85%). This may be attributed to more electron–hole pair recombination centers caused by increasing Au content, which could counteract its positive effect on the restraint of the recombination of electron–hole pairs.

3.3.2 Incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE). 
The corresponding incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are shown in Fig. 9. IPCE is defined as the number of generated electrons divided by the number of incident photons. The IPCE spectra indicate that the maximum efficiency is obtained at a wavelength of around 520 nm, in coincidence with the absorption wavelength of the N719 dyes and Au nanoparticles. Clearly, with the incorporation content of Au nanoparticles increasing from 0.5 wt% to 2 wt%, the intensity of IPCE increases, displaying a similar trend to that of Jsc. An analogous tendency can also be seen for DSSCs based on 3% and 4% Au concentrations. When the content of Au is 2%, it reaches a maximum IPCE of ∼50% for the AZS2 sample. An obvious IPCE feature is the spectrum broadening to a longer wavelength with increasing amount of Au nanoparticles inlaid on Zn2SnO4/SnO2, attributed to the plasma resonance effect.

3.3.3 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra analysis. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements are performed to investigate the interfacial reaction of photoexcited electrons and the electron transport kinetics of DSSCs based on Zn2SnO4/SnO2 and Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2. Fig. 10a depicts the Nyquist plots of DSSCs based on ZS, AZS0, AZS1, AZS2, AZS3 and AZS4 film electrodes. The equivalent circuit is shown as the inset in Fig. 10a using non-linear-least-square (NLLS) fit analysis software (Zview software) and the fitting data are given in Table 3. Rs can be recognized and fitted according to an equivalent circuit model as the resistance of the interface of FTO and the photoelectrode material. The Rs value of DSSCs based on ZS, AZS0, AZS1, AZS2, AZS3 and AZS4 calculated according to the equivalent circuit is 6.04, 4.03, 7.28, 3.66, 6.21 and 2.65 Ù, respectively. It is clearly seen that the value of Rs for AZS0 and AZS2 is better than that of ZS and AZS1 counterparts, implying a better electronic contact at the interface between FTO and the photoelectrode for AZS0 and AZS2. The big semicircle in the Nyquist plot corresponds to the electron transfer resistance at the oxide/dye/electrolyte interface, larger resistance is observed for Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (312.6 Ù) compared to Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (275.6 Ù). Moreover, with the increase of concentration of Au, the resistance at the interface decreases from 275.6 Ù to 147.8 Ù, demonstrating the less electron transport resistance and less electrons going back to the electrolyte at the oxide/electrolyte interface.64 It is known that the noble metal nanoparticles can cause a potential barrier at the surface of the oxide semiconductor, preventing the recombination of electron–holes (Fig. 10b). This result comes to the same conclusion as PL spectra. However, for 4% Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2, its electrochemical impedance in the intermediate-frequency region is larger than that of 3% Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2.

In order to further demonstrate that Au inlaid in Zn2SnO4/SnO2 can reduce the recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, the impedance spectra of pure Zn2SnO4/SnO2 and Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 are measured under forward bias in the dark (Fig. S3†). Responses in the intermediate-frequency region are assigned to charge-transfer processes occurring at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.65 In the dark, the DSSC behaves as a leaking capacitor.66 Under forward bias in the dark, electrons are transported through the TiO2 network and react with I3−. At the same time, I− is oxidized to I3− at the counter electrode. The dark reaction impedance due to electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 to triiodide ions in the electrolyte is presented by the semicircle in the intermediate-frequency regime in the Nyquist plots. The bigger the middle frequency semicircle in the Nyquist plots is, the smaller the recombination rate for electrons at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface is. Strikingly, the impedance due to electron transfer from the conduction band of the photoelectrode film to triiodide ions in the electrolyte, presented by the semicircle in the intermediate-frequency regime, shows a gradually increasing tendency with increase of the Au content, meaning that the recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs diminishes.
Bode phase plots of EIS can offer the lifetime information of electrons during the photovoltaic process, as shown in Fig. 10b. According to the EIS model developed by Kern et al.,67 the lifetime of electrons on the photoanodes (τ) can be calculated according to the relation τ = 1/ωmax = 1/(2πfmax), where fmax is the maximum frequency of the medium-frequency peak. The fmax located at 63.19 Hz for Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (ZS) is much smaller than 102.23 Hz for 2% Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (AZS2), suggesting that τ in the ZS (2.70 ms) film is longer than that in AZS2 (1.56 ms). While the τ in AZS1 is longer than that in any other samples. This may be attributed to the effects of two aspects together. On the one side, the enhancement of Au loading can cause the potential barrier on the surface of Zn2SnO4/SnO2, which can suppress the recombination of electrons and holes. On the other side, increasing the amount of Au nanoparticles may introduce more traps for electrons, counteracting its positive effect on the restraint of the recombination of electron–hole pairs.


3.3.4 DSSCs configuration and related mechanism. 
In order to better understand the reasons for the performance variation of DSSCs including the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit photocurrent density, fill factor and power conversion efficiency, the DSSC construction (Fig. 11) is depicted and the related mechanism is investigated. The proposed charge transfer process in the oxide/Au/dye/electrolyte system is illustrated in Fig. 11. Zn2SnO4 and SnO2 are both wide band-gap semiconductors with the same band-gap of 3.6 eV. Both valence band and conduction band of Zn2SnO4 are more negative than that of the SnO2 counterpart.37 The good match of band edges between Zn2SnO4 and SnO2 is important to form a type II heterojunction. In addition, the LOMO of the dye is more negative than the conduction band edge of the oxide, which is an essential condition for the normal state of DSSCs. Under UV irradiation, electrons photogenerated from the dye pass through the Au nanoparticles, along the lower lying conduction band of Zn2SnO4 to the lowest conduction band edge of SnO2, while the photogenerated holes in the dye are reduced by I− in the electrolyte. Furthermore, the surface plasmatic resonance created by Au nanoparticles can cause strong local field enhancement around Au nanoparticles, which can increase the light absorption of the surrounding dye molecules in a dye-loaded film and boost the photogenerated electrons consequently. Besides the spatial separation of charge carrier acceleration caused by simultaneous transfer of electrons and holes in the Zn2SnO4/SnO2/Au/dye system, it is worth noting that a barrier is formed on the surface of the oxide semiconductor due to the effect of Au nanoparticles as elaborated before, which reduces the probability of recombination of electrons and holes.
 Fig. 11  Schematic illustration of the configuration, surface plasmonic resonance of Au nanoparticles, charge transfer process and adjustment of the Fermi level in DSSCs based on the Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 photoanode. 
Two elucidations can be accounted for the enhancement of the short-circuit photocurrent density. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Au nanoparticles, on the one hand, plays a key role in the enhancement of the short-circuit photocurrent density. The increase can be attributed to the boost of visible light absorption (Fig. 6). By proper coupling of Au nanoparticles onto Zn2SnO4/SnO2, light can be efficiently trapped and concentrated by dyes, as a result of which, the optical absorption and photocurrent can be enhanced significantly. On the other hand, the decrease of the electron–hole recombination rate is essential for the improvement of photocurrent density, which can be attributed to three primary reasons. First and foremost, the potential barrier on the surface of the oxide semiconductor caused by Au nanoparticles hinders the recombination of electrons and holes. When an electron passes along the conduction band edge of the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 composite, it is unlikely to go back to the dye or electrolyte due to the presence of this barrier. Second, the compositing of Zn2SnO4 and SnO2 to form a heterojunction can suppress the recombination of electrons and holes, which increases the separation efficiency of photo-induced electron–hole pairs in the surface and interface. Third, it is the close contact among rounded cubes and the hollow structure that increases the electron mobility, and reduces the probability of recombination.
The evolution of open circuit voltage with increasing content of Au nanoparticles can be explained as follows. For the Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2, the open circuit voltage shows a sharp decreasing trend compared with that of Zn2SnO4/SnO2. The reason can be explained as follows. The Fermi level corresponding to Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 is created because the electrons in Au nanoparticles and Zn2SnO4/SnO2 are moved to attain a stable balance. The Fermi level of Au nanoparticles is lower than the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 composite counterpart. If such metal particles come into contact with a charged semiconductor nanostructure, the electrons in the semiconductor will flow to the side of metal nanoparticles, leading to accumulation of electrons on the surface of the metal and aggregation of holes on the surface of the semiconductor. Consequently, in order to balance the charge between the metal and semiconductor, the Fermi level of Au nanoparticles shifts to more positive potentials compared with that of Zn2SnO4/SnO2. It is known that the open circuit voltage in electrochemical DSSCs is limited by the difference between the Fermi level of the electron-conducting nanostructure and the redox potential of the electrolyte. The open circuit voltage of Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2, therefore, shows a decrease (587, 596 and 600 mV) compared with that of the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 composite (674 mV). However, it is interesting to note that with the increase of loading amount of Au, the open circuit displays a slight increase. This is because the Fermi level of the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 semiconductor dictates the energetics of the reduction process at the semiconductor–dye interface. The Fermi level of an n-type semiconductor is determined by expression (3)68 (3)where Ec is the conduction-band energy level, nc is the density of net ionized states (or accumulated electrons in the present case), and Nc is the density of state at the conduction band. The position of the Fermi level that lies between the valance and conduction bands is dependent on the electron accumulation within the semiconductor particles. As more electrons are accumulated within the CB of Zn2SnO4/SnO2, the Fermi level becomes more negative and shifts closer to the conduction band edge of Zn2SnO4/SnO2, as shown in Fig. 11.
On the basis of the above experimental results, the highest power conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on the 2% Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 (AZS2) electrode can be attributed to the effect of three factors. Firstly, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Au nanoparticles plays a crucial role in the enhancement of visible light absorption as shown in Fig. 6, which increases the photocurrent density significantly. Secondly, the potential barrier on the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 surface caused by Au nanoparticles can suppress electron–hole recombination, diminish the loss of electrons during the transfer process and improve the photocurrent density, which are demonstrated in PL emission spectra and EIS spectra. Thirdly, the enhanced photovoltaic performance can also be attributed to unique structural characteristics of hollow rounded cubes. It has been shown that the hollow rounded cube structured 2% Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 sample displays a high surface area (18.48 m2 g−1) and high dye adsorption (43.23 nmol cm−2). Accordingly, the 2% Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 sample possesses higher power conversion efficiency than the Zn2SnO4/SnO2 sample and therefore exhibits enhanced photovoltaic performance.

4. Conclusions
A facile strategy has been developed for the fabrication of Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes with an adjustable Au loading content using ZnSn(OH)6 as the precursor, chloroauric acid as the Au source and ascorbic acid as the reducing agent. The micro/nanostructure and chemical compositions of Zn2SnO4/SnO2 and Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 samples were characterized using XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS and N2 adsorption and desorption techniques. The photovoltaic performance was evaluated by using DRS, PL, J–V, IPCE and EIS techniques. As photoanodes for DSSCs, the Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes demonstrate a greatly enhanced Jsc and improved power conversion efficiency of up to 2.04%, almost 73% higher compared to that of Zn2SnO4/SnO2 based DSSCs. The relationship between the microstructure, optical response, electron transfer and photovoltaic performance is discussed and analyzed. The enhancement of photovoltaic performance of Au inlaid Zn2SnO4/SnO2 hollow rounded cubes can be attributed to the following reasons. The well-distributed Au nanoparticles boost the light absorption significantly due to the effect of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and suppress the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs via forming a potential barrier on the surface of Zn2SnO4/SnO2. In addition, the highly crystalline state, large surface area, and large pore size of Au–Zn2SnO4/SnO2 also contribute to the improvement of photovoltaic performance.
