Moreover, challenges and future trends in the field of solution-processed photodetectors are proposed.
1. Introduction
A photodetector is a kind of photo-electronic device, which can convert light signals to electrical signals due to the photoelectric effect of semiconductor materials. The emergence and development of semiconductor materials and devices have greatly promoted the progress of modern society and brought about tremendous changes in our daily life because of their important applications, including light controlled switches, medical imaging, information communication, various sensors for body health and safety monitoring, and display technology.1–3 The photoelectric effect of semiconductors can be classified as a photo-conductive effect, photo-gating effect, photo-voltaic effect and surface decoration effect based on different device structures and materials characteristics.4 In terms of the full spectrum, three important spectrum zones including ultraviolet (10 nm–400 nm), visible (400 nm–760 nm) and infrared (760 nm–2.5 μm), are usually detected by a variety of photodetectors.4 The response of a photodetector to a specific spectrum zone will lead to totally different application scenarios. The successful examples of ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) photodetectors include astronomical detectors, wide spectral switchers, chip processors and memory storage devices,5–7 while the applications of visible and near IR (NIR) photodetectors include commercial consumer electronics such as smart phones and digital cameras achieving video recording and remote sensing.8–10 In addition, multi-band mid-IR photodetectors can be widely applied for surveillance, medical diagnostics, bio-imaging, and navigational aids and even in military applications including missile guidance, infrared thermal imaging and remote sensing, etc.11–15
At present, commercial traditional photodetectors mainly use silicon as the photo-active material.16,17 The growth of high-quality silicon films by the gas phase method requires expensive instruments, complicated processing technology and huge energy consumption. Besides, the conventional spectral response range of silicon photodetectors is limited to 300–1100 nm due to their intrinsic band-gap (1.1 eV),18 which restricts their application in specific situations. The high cost and the inability to detect light with a larger wavelength range greatly limit the application of photodetectors. More importantly, crystalized silicon is rigid and mechanically inflexible, which severely limit its further application in next generation flexible electronic devices, especially in wearable electronics. Compared to silicon photodetectors, another commercial photodetector based on GaAs and InGaAs has the metrics of higher electronic mobility, wider bandgap and low power consumption.19–21 However, the complicated manufacturing process, limited reserves in the earth and especially the toxicity of element arsenic seriously restrict the wide application of As-based photodetectors. Therefore, a new series of photo-active semi-conductive materials including promising two-dimensional (2D) materials, have attracted widespread attention in recent years.22,23 2D materials originated from the research on graphene,24,25 and, subsequently, more and more 2D materials with excellent properties, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), topological insulators,26–30 phosphorene,31–34 perovskite,35 MXenes,36,37 antimonene,38–40etc. have been investigated. These photo-active semi-conductive materials are experimentally and theoretically verified with universal advantages such as tunable band structures,41,42 layer-dependent properties,43 high carrier mobility,44,45 and strong light absorption.46 Due to these merits, these photo-active materials have a wide range of applications in electronics,47–49 (opto)electronics,50–62 bio-medicine,63–70 sensing,71–75 catalysis76–79etc. With regard to materials science, these photo-active materials should meet the requirements of high absorption coefficient, large carrier mobility and suitable energy-level alignment. Consequently, high performance photodetectors can achieve important parameters including high sensitivity, excellent spectrum selectivity, rapidity, high stability and high signal-to-noise ratios.80
In recent decades, solution-processed semiconductors are much more welcome compared to the original vapor-assisted deposition methods including chemical vapor deposition and physical vapor deposition. The energy consumption can be greatly cut down and the expensive instruments can be avoided, and thus processing cost can be greatly reduced. Furthermore, the great attention to human health requires next generation photo-conductors to be more flexible to satisfy the application of wearable devices. Normally, the substrates are polymers such as polyimide, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Other substrates such as paper or fiber are also adopted as flexible substrate materials. Vapor-assisted deposition processing methods are unsuitable for the large-scale production of flexible photodetectors. The low-cost casting methods to deposit films including spin coating, doctor blading, spray coating and roll-to-roll printing have been widely applied in large-scale manufacturing. Consequently, solution-processed techniques have great potential in next generation photodetectors.
From the perspective of materials science, photo-active materials include inorganic materials, organic materials and inorganic–organic hybrid materials. Inorganic photo-active materials obtained using facile chemical synthesis techniques can be tuned by chemical element selection and nanostructure design, and have high intrinsic carrier mobility, while organic photo-active materials show attractive and beneficial characteristics such as strong absorption coefficients, mechanical flexibility, ease of processing of thin films and ability to tailor the band-gap, which provide them great prospects for photodetector applications, such as organic field-effect transistors (OFET).81–83 Hybrid photo-active materials are of two types: the composites of organic and inorganic materials and organometal halide perovskite materials. Organic and inorganic composites can utilize the metrics of both organic and inorganic materials. Organometal halide perovskite materials have attracted great attention due to their fast carrier mobility and the long-life span of excitons. Hybrid photo-active materials offer the potential to deliver efficient photodetectors with structure tunability and low-cost fabrication.
Although several comprehensive reviews84,85 have been extensively dedicated to specific materials such as inorganic materials, perovskites or those with special application,4,86 none of them fully cover the solution processing method and the systemic, overall material progress. Therefore, in this review, we will carefully summarize the progress in photodetector devices focusing on solution processed inorganic and hybrid photo-active materials. After a brief introduction of solution processed photodetectors, we will address device structures and basic parameters that are important for distinguishing the performance of photodetectors, followed by detailed solution processed methods. Then considering photo-active materials, two parts of inorganic and inorganic/organic hybrid materials are discussed separately. In the last part, we conclude this review and propose some strategies for improving the performance of photodetectors.
2. Device structures and important parameters of photodetectors
2.1. Device structures
Photodetectors, a kind of optoelectronics device, convert absorbed optical energy to electrical signals such as photocurrent and photovoltage. According to the structure of the device, photodetectors can be divided into photoconductors, photodiodes and phototransistors. A photoconductive detector has a photosensitive layer between two transverse metal electrodes. A simple photo-response mechanism is equivalent to the photon–electron conversion process: the photoconductivity effect. That is when light illuminates the photosensitive materials, and the inter-electrode channel produces carrier bias. The carrier is separated at a set voltage and then collected at the electrode. The advantages of photoconductive devices are the facile fabrication and great potential to apply in flexible optoelectronic devices. However, these planar devices are often subjected to the effects of slow light effect, low photosensitivity and obvious dielectric hysteresis.
A photodiode detector is a vertical structure similar to photovoltaic devices. The photogenerated carrier pairs (electrons and holes) are separated by the built-in electric field. Then the separated electrons and holes are transported to the corresponding electrodes with a low driving voltage. The photodiode detector shows a low dark current, a fast response and a high separation efficiency of electron and hole pairs especially at low negative bias. However, the structure of the device requires the electrode to be highly transparent.
Phototransistors incorporate gate and dielectric layers into the device to reduce the noise signal and amplify electrical signals, and finally improve responsibility and gain. By further combining two kinds of high mobility semiconductors together, they show greatly improved conductivity. The reason is the photo-selective effect, which means that one of the electrons or holes is transferred to high mobility semiconductors as a charge transfer channel, while the opposite holes or electrons are trapped in the original position as a gate.
2.2. Important parameters
There exist different kinds of device structures based on different photodetection mechanisms. Basically, the key parameters to characterize the performance of photodetectors are as follows: photo-responsivity (R), external quantum efficiency (EQE), detectivity (D*), gain (G), response speed (Rs), and linear dynamic range (LDR).
The photoresponsivity is calculated by the ratio of the photocurrent because of the light illumination to the corresponding incident light intensity. It is expressed by the equation as follows:  where Jlight is the current at the light state, Jdark is the current at the dark state, P is the incident power density, and A is the effective illumination area on the photodetector.
External quantum efficiency is the ratio of the number of charge carriers conserved by the photo-active materials to the number of photons of a given energy exposed on the photodetector from the outside, and can be calculated as follows:  where Rλ is the photoresponsivity at a specific light wavelength, h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light, e is the electron charge, and λ is the light wavelength.
The minimum detectable power of illumination, which decides the threshold of the photodetector, is defined as detectivity (D*). The main influence in detecting a small amount of light is the dark current, which is also called noise signal. Therefore, the lower the dark current, the smaller the influence on weak light detection. The detailed detectivity can be denoted as  where Δf is the electrical bandwidth and Jn is the noise current. Normally the dominant contribution to the noise signal is the dark current, so the equation can be abbreviated as  
Noise equivalent power (NEP) is the signal power, which gives a signal-to-noise ratio of one in a one hertz output bandwidth, as a magnitude of the sensitivity of a photodetector. This value can confirm the minimum illuminated light distinguished from the noise. The equation is written as  
Gain (G), another important parameter of photodetectors, represents the number of carriers passing through an external circuit when a certain amount of incident light illuminates and is determined by the following formula:  where, τh is the lifetime of the holes, τt is the transportation time of carriers to electrodes, d is the thickness of the device, μ is the mobility of carriers and V is the applied bias.
Response time reflects the response speed to incident light, characterized as a rise time and a decay time, decided by the time between the zone of 10% and 90% maximum photocurrent. These data are mainly influenced by the defects where the carriers are bound and separated and the complicated recombination process of holes and electrons. In general, transient response photodetectors are suitable for the detection of light that is changing quickly and for applications that need exact time precision.
The last important parameter is the linear dynamic range (LDR), also called the linearity of the photosensitive device, indicating that the photocurrent and input light intensity respond linearly in a certain spectral range. It is commonly expressed in a logarithmic scale as  where  is the photocurrent at the light intensity of 1 mW cm−2.
The excellent performances of photodetectors can be verified by the above parameters. Both photo-active materials and device structures are critical for high performance photodetectors. Three kinds of materials including inorganic materials, organic materials and organic–inorganic hybrid materials, have been extensive researched in recent years for pursuing the next generation high performance photodetectors.
3. Solution processing methods
Semiconductor materials are mainly composed of large bulk-states, nano-states, and film-states in scientific research and practical application. Generally speaking, their excellent properties are determined by their crystal structure, size and dimension, surface structure and band structure. For example, bulk state semiconductors conform to solid state theory, which means that the crystal structure determines the energy band structure and defect structure of materials, and consequently affects the physical and chemical properties of materials. When the size of the semiconductor is reduced to the nanometer scale, it will show a series of new and different properties from bulk materials and single atom molecules, including quantum size effect, special surface effect, quantum tunneling effect and dielectric confinement effect, which bring novel optical, electrical, thermal and magnetic properties in practical applications. The film-state is a focus of research and application of semiconductors at present. Film-state materials are widely applied in functional devices including chips and integrated circuits. The preparation methods of nano-semiconductor films mainly include physical and chemical methods. The former usually employ high temperature or high energy to cause the change of the physical state of the substance, while the latter mainly obtain thin film deposition by chemical reaction. The physical methods usually include optical, electrical etching, and physical construction technology to prepare nanomaterials, thus, such a preparation process is often under harsh conditions and needs large instruments and plenty of energy consumption. Compared to physical methods, chemical methods cost less and are versatile, including the solid phase method, liquid phase method and gas phase method. Solid phase reaction is a direct method which is simple and the product can be prepared in large quantities. The disadvantages are the difficulty to obtain high purity and quality products and the inability to control the morphology of materials accurately, so there are relatively few practical applications so far. Similarly, in the gas phase method, nanomaterials are obtained by chemical reaction of substances in a gaseous state. The advantage of this method is the high purity of the product and the controllable morphology. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the most common method used in gas phase synthesis. The chemical reaction is produced by various gaseous elements or compounds to form a film on a heating substrate. Similarly, high energy consumption and expensive instruments cannot be avoided. Finally, the liquid phase method is a process of preparing target film nanomaterials by chemical reaction in solution. The reaction conditions are milder, and it is convenient to control the reaction. Take nanocrystal synthesis as an example, the growth rates can be regulated by the reaction temperature and the concentration of precursors. The sizes can be controlled by adding various surfactants. The future application in flexible devices further promotes the development of liquid phase processing methods.
From materials to devices, the exact solution processing technology contains solution synthesis and the liquid phase film-forming process. There exist, in principle, two approaches to synthesize materials: the “bottom-up” approach and the “top-down” approach. The “bottom-up” approach attempts to synthesize materials from atomic or molecular components, while the “top-down” approach seeks to synthesize materials from their bulk materials, such as electron beam or X-ray lithography used in silicon (or other semiconductors) chips.87,88 In liquid phase synthesis, the “bottom-up” approach is widely applied to construct nanoparticles, while the “top-down” approach is more suitable for two-dimensional (2D) thin-layer materials.
3.1. Solution synthesis

3.1.1. Hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis. 
Hydrothermal or solvothermal synthesis employs special closed reaction containers (such as autoclaves), and heat the reaction system to a specific temperature, producing a high-pressure local reaction environment in the system in the presence of water, organic solvents or mixture solvents as the reaction medium. It is an effective method for chemical reaction and material preparation, especially for insoluble chemicals under atmospheric pressure. Compared with other liquid phase synthesis methods, the hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis process has several obvious advantages. Firstly, the reaction is usually carried out in a Teflon-lined autoclave, so nanomaterials can be prepared at relatively lower temperatures. Secondly, the activity of the corresponding reactants was changed and improved by the hydrothermal method, so it is possible to prepare some nanomaterials at special states, such as metastable or other special condensed states, which is hard to obtain using the solid phase reaction. Thirdly, it is easier to control the morphology, size, crystallinity, purity and good dispersion of the nanomaterials by simply changing reaction conditions such as temperature, reaction time, reactant concentration, surfactant and solvent medium. For example, titanium oxide (TiO2) was used as a Schottky diode ultraviolet (UV) detector, which was prepared via a low-temperature hydrothermal method.89 Other metal oxides like ZnO90 or Nb2O591 were also synthesized by a hydrothermal treatment. Hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis is a widely applied, feasible method to obtain nanomaterials with low cost, high purity, narrow particle size distribution and good crystal shape.


3.1.2. Sol–gel synthesis. 
Sol–gel synthesis employs inorganic matter or metal alkoxides as precursors, then these substances are mixed in a liquid phase, accompanied by hydrolysis and condensation reactions, manifesting a transparent state firstly. Then the sol is aged and the colloidal particles are slowly polymerized, accompanied by the formation of a three-dimensional (3D) network structure inside the gel networks. Compared with other synthesis methods, the sol–gel method has many unique advantages, such as (1) the reactants used in the sol–gel process are dispersed uniformly in the solution with low viscosity. Thus, the reactants are eventually mixed at the molecular level when the gel is forming with the process of reaction; (2) it is easy to dope some elements uniformly at the molecular level; (3) compared with solid state reaction, the sol–gel reaction easily happens at a low temperature. According to the dispersed phase medium, gels are divided into hydrogels, aerogels and alcohol gels. The thin film can be easily constructed by the sol–gel method that can simplify the process of the photodetector device fabrication. Take ZnO92,93 and TiO294 thin films as examples, these sol–gel thin films can be easily prepared on the substrate to fabricate photodetector devices. Other metal oxides like WO395 or Ga2O396 can also be prepared by the sol–gel method.


3.1.3. Hot injection synthesis. 
In the hot injection method, the precursor solution is injected rapidly into the hot reaction solution by using a syringe, which causes the rapid nucleation and growth of nanocrystals because of the supersaturation of the solution. The growth state of the grains is basically the same, thus ensuring the mono-dispersity of the nanoparticles.97 The hot injection method has four main advantages: (1) simple equipment and easily controlled reaction process; (2) the product has good mono-dispersity; (3) reaction conditions are mild and fast crystallization occurs; (4) the product has high purity, good crystalline form and controllable morphology. It has been widely applied in the preparation of nanocrystal compounds of II–VI, IV–VI, and III–V semiconductors, which has great potential in the applications of photodetectors,98 photovoltaic cells,99–101 quantum dot light emitting diodes (QD-LEDs),102,103 catalysts,104 biomedical labeling,105 and even cancer therapy.106
Since first reported by Geim and Novoselov in 2004,48 graphene as the most representative of 2D materials, caused a revolution in materials science and technology. However, its nature with zero band gap limits its application in electronics, optoelectronics and other fields. Inspired by the preparation of graphene, scientists have also prepared plenty of other layered materials into 2D thin-layer materials, including boron nitride, metal chalcogenides, transition metal oxides, carbon/nitride materials (MXenes) and black phosphorus, which are commonly known as graphene-like materials. Unlike graphene, these graphene-like materials generally have an inherent bandgap, which can be directly applied in the field of electronics and optoelectronics, and the thin layer 2D structures improve the physical and chemical activity, and the ion exchange ability and changes the energy band structure of the materials. Furthermore, 2D nanomaterials can be used as basic building blocks to reconstruct new 3D macroscopic materials by reassembly expanding a new application of 2D nanomaterials. By the “top-down” approach, the liquid phase exfoliation method has become a hot topic in research and industrial field due to its advantages of low cost, high controllability and easy to achieve large-scale fabrication. Nicolosi et al.107 reviewed the structures, properties and applications of several popular 2D nanomaterials, as well as some widely used liquid phase exfoliation methods. When 3D layered crystals are in a liquid phase environment, great efforts have been applied to weaken the interaction force between layers under physical and/or chemical effects, and finally stable dispersed 2D nanomaterials are formed in the solution. Those strategies include ion exchange exfoliation, intercalation exfoliation, oxidation and reduction exfoliation, selective etching exfoliation, sonication exfoliation, shear exfoliation and so on.


3.1.4. Direct sonication exfoliation. 
Sonication is a widely used preparation method of 2D nanomaterials by liquid phase exfoliation, which can completely exfoliate layered crystal materials with a weak inter-laminar force. Hernandez et al.108 demonstrated that N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) is an excellent organic solvent to exfoliate graphite and achieved graphene dispersions with a concentration up to ∼0.01 mg ml−1 in the absence of defects or oxides. They deduced that the energy required to exfoliate graphene is balanced by the solvent–graphene interaction for solvents whose surface energies (40–50 mJ m−2) match that of graphene. Other solvents are also applied to exfoliate graphene such as o-dichlorobenzene,109 a peculiar class of perfluorinated aromatic molecules110 including hexafluorobenzene (C6F6), octafluorotoluene (C6F5CF3), pentafluorobenzonitrile (C6F5CN), and pentafluoropyridine (C5F5N). This strategy has been expanded to other compounds like h-BN, TMDCs, and black phosphorus nanosheets (NS).111–117 Lee et al. believed that the successful sonication exfoliation of layered materials is attributed to the effects of acoustic cavitation, mechanical shearing, and microbubbling using probe sonicators.118 The shortcomings of direct sonication exfoliation mainly manifest in three aspects: firstly, local high-intensity ultrasound can break up 2D nanosheets, reduce their size, and increase the edge defects; secondly, higher sonication power will cause the decomposition of some solvents that have low stability, resulting in free radicals, which possibly leads to a small amount of products; thirdly, the concentration of 2D nanosheets dispersion prepared by this method is quite low, which is currently unsatisfactory for large quantity applications.


3.1.5. Shear exfoliation. 
Shear exfoliation is a liquid phase exfoliation method for preparing 2D nanomaterials based on shearing force. Similar to the direct sonication exfoliation method, the 2D nanomaterials prepared by the shear exfoliation method are of high quality because only physical forces are involved in the preparation process. Simple equipment (e.g., a kitchen mixer) can produce high-speed shearing force. Shear exfoliation has been successfully applied to the preparation of graphene,115 MoS2,119,120 WS2,121 BN,122 pnictogen (As, Sb, Bi)123 and other 2D nanomaterials.124 Organic, aqueous, and mixture solvents are widely used as dispersion liquids for exfoliated nanomaterials. The advantages of shear exfoliation are easy operation, simple equipment, good quality of exfoliated products, and easy to achieve large-scale preparation of 2D nanomaterials. However, the disadvantage of this method is that the dispersion obtained by shear exfoliation is a mixture usually containing single-layer, multi-layer, even a small number of layered crystal sheets (with relatively high distributions, including single-layer, multi-layer and even a small number of layered crystal sheets). Further centrifugation grading treatment is necessary to obtain 2D nanomaterial dispersions with a narrow distribution because of the wide distribution.


3.1.6. Ion exchange exfoliation. 
The ion exchange method is based on ion exchange between ions of layered crystals and external ions. Ions with stronger hydration ability and a larger hydration radius are introduced into layers to increase the lamellar space of layered crystals and weaken the interaction force between layers to achieve 2D nanostructures. The driving force of ions entering into material layers mainly comes from ion osmotic pressure equilibrium. For example, thin flakes of titanium dioxide have been synthesized through the ion exchange exfoliation of a layered precursor with inorganic or organic chemicals.125,126 Ion exchange exfoliation, as a common method for preparing 2D nanomaterials from 3D layered crystals, is suitable for layered materials containing exchangeable ions between layers. The most prominent advantage of this method is the mild exfoliation process, while the disadvantage is the slow ion exchange process, leading to a low exfoliation efficiency.


3.1.7. Intercalation exfoliation. 
3D layered crystals are formed by combining the corresponding 2D nanostructured lamellae with a weak interaction force, which enables some molecules or ions to enter the interlayer of the layered crystals under certain conditions, resulting in a local strain change of the layered crystals, thus increasing the interlayer spacing, weakening the interlayer interaction force, and decreasing the exfoliation energy. Finally, it is easy to peel off in an appropriate environment to produce the corresponding 2D nanomaterials. Normally, sonication, stirring and centrifugation are used as assistant approaches for liquid phase exfoliation of the intercalated layered crystals. 2D nanomaterials based on the intercalation method have been widely used in many kinds of 3D layered crystal materials, such as graphite, transition metal disulfides, layered carbon/nitride and so on. Organolithium compounds were investigated as intercalation agents to transition metal disulfides, such as butyllithium.127,128 There are two main steps that exist in the process of lithium ion intercalation exfoliation of transition metal disulfides. Firstly, lithium ions enter into the interlayer of layered disulfide crystals to form a lithium ion intercalation structure; secondly, the volume expansion of lithium ion intercalated disulfides occurs in aqueous solution due to ion reverse osmosis, thus, the corresponding 2D nanometer disulfide slices are produced.129 Intercalation of hydrazine, together with the co-intercalation of N,N-dimethylformamide applied in MXenes has been reported by Yury et al.130 Electrochemical intercalation and exfoliation methods are also promising approaches to the solution phase preparation of 2D materials.131 The choices of intercalation agents and solvents are key points. The exfoliated 2D nanolayer materials must interact well with solvents in order to effectively prevent agglomeration, ensuring a stable dispersion of 2D nanomaterials.


3.1.8. Oxidation and reduction exfoliation. 
The oxidation and reduction exfoliation method means the oxidization of layered crystalline materials firstly, introducing oxygen-containing functional groups into the 2D nanostructure lamellae to weaken the interaction force between the lamellae and make them exfoliate. Then the oxidized 2D nano-lamellae are reduced to the desired corresponding 2D nano-lamellae. The oxidation and reduction exfoliation is the main method for preparing graphene in large quantities. Graphene oxide (GO) with various degrees of oxidation can be synthesized by a modified Hummers method via a strong oxidant.132 GO then can be converted to graphene after reduction (e.g. thermal reduction, chemical reduction, photocatalytic reduction, electrochemical reduction, and solvothermal reduction).133–135 However, this method is limited to graphene at the moment, and other examples have been seldom reported so far.


3.1.9. Selective etching exfoliation. 
Selective etching is a method of etching specific atomic layers in 3D layered crystals, leaving the target 2D nanosheet structure. It has been successfully applied to the preparation of 2D MXenes, such as Ti3AlC2, Ti2AlC, and Ti4AlC3. Naguib et al. used 50% hydrofluoric acid solution to treat layered crystal Ti3AlC2 at room temperature, selectively etched the atomic layer of Al in the layered crystal, and prepared 2D nanomaterial Ti3C2.136 NH4HF2, MgH2 and other acids can also be applied to selectively etch Ti3AlC2,137,138 and sometimes two steps of etching together with the HF reaction are applied.139,140 When preparing 2D nanomaterials based on selective etching, the key point is the selection of appropriate etching reagents. To achieve large-scale and controllable preparation of 2D nanomaterials for the practical application of 2D nanomaterials, it is inevitable to choose environmentally friendly, non-toxic, green and low-cost etching reagents.

3.2. Liquid phase film-forming
To satisfy the commercial requirements of the large-scale processing of photodetectors, liquid phase film-forming is well developed and explored. Liquid phase film-forming costs less and is a fast process with simple manufacturing equipment, unlike gas phase filming techniques that need expensive semiconductor processing devices. Liquid phase film-forming is suitable both for industry scale manufacture with large quantities and laboratory trails with small quantities. It has great potential to utilize liquid phase film forming techniques on flexible substrates like paper, plastic, textile and mica, which is more sensitive to the traditional processing techniques that need a high temperature. Basically, there are two processing methods called coating and printing. The coating methods contain drop casting, spin coating, spray coating, and doctor blading, while the printing techniques include screen printing and ink-jet printing, which are widely applied in the liquid phase fabrication of photodetectors.

3.2.1. Drop casting. 
Drop casting is the simplest method without the need for any equipment, and is one of the widely used methods in laboratory. The basic procedure is that firstly the nanomaterials are dispersed in a solution, then the solution dropped on a horizontal substrate and finally dried in the oven or atmosphere. Sometimes, a certain amount of binders is added to the solution to increase the viscosity for a better film quality. The thickness of the film can be easily controlled by the concentration of the solution and the quantity of droplets. The film of a large amount of nanomaterials can be realized by this method.141–144 However, the film should be quite thick, so it is still a challenge to precisely control the thickness and uniformity of the film, for example, a thin uniform film.


3.2.2. Dip coating. 
Dip coating is also a simple traditional way of depositing materials onto a substrate, especially small slabs and cylinders, and there will exist a uniform thin film after the solidification of the liquid. The process is preparing a solution in a baker firstly, and then taking the substrate on top of the solution, followed by vertical immersion into the solution for a short time and back. This step is repeated several times until a semisolid film exists on the substrate. The thickness and uniformity of the film is determined by viscous force, capillary (surface tension) force and gravity, together with the gas overhead. Besides, the moving speed of the substrate should not be avoided. The faster the substrate is withdrawn, the thicker the film deposited. The volatility of the selected solvents also has a huge influence on the thickness and quality of film forming. The actual film forming process is still so complicated that the theoretical prediction of film parameters is difficult. Therefore, it is still far away from the precise coating manufacture in factories but it is widely utilized in the laboratory because it is a straightforward method. Successful examples to obtain film from nanoparticles are listed.145–147


3.2.3. Spin coating. 
Spin coating or spin casting is a recently developed way of obtaining a uniform thin liquid film on substrates, especially small flat disks, followed by drying. The process consists of dropping a solution on the top of the substrate that is fixed from the backside by a vacuum, and then the substrate is made to spin and the redundant solvent removed with the help of the centrifugal force and solidification by drying. There exists a compromise between centrifugal and viscous forces, so spinning speed has a huge influence on the thickness of the film. Volatile solvents are commonly used because it is easier to remove the excessive solvent during spinning. The key parameters to theoretically predict the thickness and uniformity of the film are the rotating speed, gas conditions, rheology of the concentrating and solidifying liquid, and the concentration. Organic materials are especially suitable for organic film forming because of the higher viscosity.148,149 Sol–gel solutions are also extremely suitable for spin coating techniques.150–154 The recently reported organic halide perovskites are best examples for the application of spin coating techniques to form a uniform film.155–158


3.2.4. Spray coating. 
Spray coating is a widely used technology in the paint and coating industry for house renovations and furniture protection. The spraying material is in the liquid state (solution, sol–gel, suspension, etc.) at first. The liquid solution is atomized into small particles by the device, and then uniformly coated on the surface of the substrate by a certain amount of compressed carrier gas, thus forming a coating or film. This technology utilizes the existing industrial technologies and has great potential for large-area and low-cost processing. Furthermore, it is suitable for thin-film deposition on anomalistic substrate materials and geometries, having great potential in flexible electronic devices.159–162 However, the higher surface roughness and the less defined morphology of the film by spray-deposition should be carefully considered.


3.2.5. Doctor blading. 
Doctor blading is one of the widely applicable solutions for producing thin films on a large area surface. The typical doctor blading process includes a well-mixed slurry, which consists of a suspension of main soluble materials and other additives (binders or dispersants), placed on a substrate beyond the doctor blade. Then a constant relative movement exists between the blade and the substrate, and the slurry spreads uniformly on the substrate to form a thin sheet. The speed of doctor blading can be operated to several meters per minute and the substrates can be widely chosen. The wet film thickness has a very wide range from 20 to several hundred microns, which is decided by the concentration and viscosity of the solution, the movement speed of the blade, and the distance between the blade and substrates. The successful examples applied in photodetectors are organic, perovskite and inorganic materials.163–167 For example, Li et al. reported an excellent perovskite film prepared by a doctor blading film-deposition technology under ambient conditions.164


3.2.6. Screen printing. 
Screen printing is a relatively fast and versatile technique, which makes the fabrication process simple, affordable, and adaptable. It needs a relatively small amount of materials for patterns, including signs, logos, as well as general lighting. Simply explained, screen printing contains the elements of a screen, stencil, squeegee, ink, press bed, and substrate. In a typical process, some ink passes through some of the screen holes, while the non-screen holes block the ink. When printing, the ink is poured into one side of the plate, and the scraper moves uniformly towards the other side at a certain pressure. During the progress, the scraper squeezes the ink through the mesh containing a pattern to the substrate. Although a very simple printing technique, the film quality of the printed pattern is greatly affected by complex processing conditions such as printing speed, angle and geometry of the squeegee, distance between the screen and the substrate, mesh material, etc. Photosensitive material films formed by screen printing are proved by these papers.168–171


3.2.7. Ink-jet printing. 
Ink-jet printing is one of the most promising techniques for inexpensive large area fabrication of next generation optoelectronics devices, including low information content displays, detection as well as general lighting.172–175 Calvert reviewed the growing efforts especially in sol–gel materials, organic materials, ceramics, nanoparticles, metals and biopolymer arrays.176 An ink jet printer comprises at least one ink jet head, which ejects ink droplets in the main scan direction. Feeder rollers feed inks relative to the ink jet head in a sub scan direction, print the image and record material two dimensionally. A system controller sets the drying heat energy according to the ejected amount and drives the thermal head to release the drying heat energy to the heating region, to promote drying of the droplet in the heating region. Similar to screen printing, inkjet printing can greatly reduce material dosages because inks are only directed to the printed areas. Coleman et al. demonstrated inkjet printing of graphene and MoS2 NS prepared by liquid exfoliation and proved the potential to combine with graphene interdigitated array electrodes to produce all-printed photodetectors.177 Other materials like organic materials and inorganic nanocrystals are demonstrated by other groups.178–180

4. Inorganic photo-active materials
From the consideration of materials science, photo-active semiconductor materials of photodetectors have gone through three generations from Si and Ge (first generation), GaAs and InSb (second generation) to SiC, GaN and ZnO, etc. (third generation). The next generation of photo-active semiconductor materials will meet the growing demands of cheap price, full spectrum detectivity, fast responsibility, light-weight design, even flexibility and transparency. Therefore, the materials with a tunable optical bandgap as well as a low-cost manufacturing should be well considered. The solution processing methods of inorganic semiconductor materials are well summarized in part III. In this part, we will summarize the widely reported solution processed inorganic materials. In the past decade, due to predominant light–matter interaction, high carrier mobility, and wide bandgap coverage, single elements and compounds from the group IVA, VA and VIA have become promising and attractive candidates for the next generation high performance optoelectronics.
4.1. Group IVA based photo-active materials
From the first generation of photodetectors, intensive research was performed based on Group IVA elements, which consists of carbon (C), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), tin (Sn), and lead (Pb) in the periodic table of the elements (Fig. 1). Among them, Si and Ge are already commercialized in the first generation, but they still deserve to be improved with new techniques. C has received widespread attention for photodetectors, while Sn and Pb are reported as compounds together with group VIA elements.
 Fig. 1  Main elements of transition metals, post transitional metal, group IVA, group VA and group VIA in the periodic table of the elements. 
The merits of carbon include high electron mobility, tunable bandgap, solution-processability, stability, non-toxicity, and low cost, which prove their potential applications in optoelectronic devices. To date, various carbon nanostructures such as zero-dimensional (0D) quantum dots (QDs), one-dimensional (1D) nanotubes and 2D graphene have been adopted to prepare photo-active layers in photodetectors. Carbon QDs, zero-dimensional carbon nanostructures with a size below 10 nm, exhibit fantastic chemical and physical properties due to their super high surface area, strong quantum confinement together with edge effects. Tang et al.181 prepared nitrogen-doped graphene QDs with an average diameter as small as 1.9 nm by a facile hydrothermal reaction. The QDs exhibit broadband emission ranging from 300 to >1000 nm due to a large conjugated system and extensive delocalized π electrons. The nitrogen doped graphene QD photodetector can respond to two zones including UV and NIR. The responsivity of the photodetector is 1.14 V W−1, and the on–off ratio is 1.03 together with a 10 s response time for light sources with a wavelength at 365 nm. While the responsivity of photodetector is 4.79 V W−1, together with an on–off of 4.29 and a slow response time of 50 s for 980 nm light sources. Zhang et al.182 introduced an asymmetric electrode structure of Ag–Au, with a responsivity of 2.10 mA W−1, a specific detectivity of 9.59 × 1011 Jones and rise and fall times of 64 ms and 43 ms. Graphene QDs can be utilized as heterojunction structures with silicon to arbitrate both charge-carrier photogeneration and transport.183,184 1D carbon nanotubes also are well explored for photodetectors, and He et al. have reviewed them in detail.185 However, the performance of pure carbon nanotubes is not satisfactory, and heterojunction structures are well developed to efficiently separate electron–hole pairs into free carriers and increase the absorption. For example, single-walled carbon nanotubes functionalized with azobenzene chromophores were presented by Zhou et al.186 and conjugated block copolymers by Hwang et al.187 Park et al.188 reported single-walled carbon nanotube/C60 heterojunctions, obtained a responsivity of 97.5 A W−1, a specific detectivity of 109 Jones and a response time of 2–4 ms. Carbon nanotube and perovskite heterojunction photodetectors will be discussed in the following perovskite part. Due to its impressive optical properties and an electrical mobility approaching 200000 cm2 V−1 s−1 for both electrons and holes, graphene ultrafast transistor-based photodetectors are well investigated.189,190 Chemically reduced GO thin film based infrared photodetectors fabricated by Ghosh et al.,191 showed a slow time response of 2.5 s. Qi et al.192 proved that graphene with oxygen functional groups (GO) shows photoresponse in UV, visible light and NIR because of the wide band adsorption. Lai et al.193 fabricated metal–GO–metal photodetectors, obtained a specific detectivity of 3.31 × 107 Jones, responsivity of 23.6 mA W−1 under 1 V bias at 410 nm, rise and fall times of 100 ms and 130 ms.
Silicon and germanium film technology dominates photodetectors, but is still unsatisfactory for wide spectrum response and flexible application. The traditional processing method needs high temperature and expensive equipment. Solution processed colloidal QDs or nanowires (NW) can regulate the electronic band-gap and achieve flexible application. Ni et al.194 fabricated silicon boron B-doped Si QDs, graphene hybrid Si QDs and graphene phototransistors, extending the photo-detection from UV to the mid-infrared (MIR) region. Si-QD/graphene photo-transistors showed ultrahigh responsivity (up to ∼109 A W−1), and specific detectivity (up to ∼1013 Jones). Yu et al.195 fabricated graphene/Si QD Schottky-junction photodetectors, and obtained high responsivity (≈0.495 A W−1), short response time (≤25 ns), and excellent specific detectivity (≈7.4 × 109 Jones). Silicon NWs can be obtained via acid etching196 and electro-chemically etching.197 Hong et al.198 fabricated p–n heterojunctions of the CuO/Si NW array, and obtained a responsivity of 0.038 mA W−1, a specific detectivity of 3 × 109 Jones and a response time of 60 μs and 80 μs. Group IV semiconductor Ge QDs as the active absorbers together with the graphene heterojunction were reported by Liu et al.,199 and a responsivity of up to 9.7 A W−1 at 1400 nm wavelength in the near-infrared zone without sacrificing the response speed (40/90 μs). Yakimov200 reported a photodetector based on Ge QDs in Si and SiGe matrices, and obtained a high detectivity of 8 × 1010 Jones. Some representative and typical materials and device structures from group IVA are shown in Fig. 2 and the related photo-response data are listed in Table 1. Group IVA based photo-active materials with high stability, versatile nanostructures, solution-processability, and fantastic chemical and physical properties are widely applied in photodetectors. Further improvement of light adsorption, large-scale preparation of materials and optimization of the device structure should be carefully considered.

4.2. Group VA based photo-active materials
Group VA elements contain nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), and bismuth (Bi) in the periodic table of the elements (Fig. 1). N, P, As and Sb are non-metals, and can react with metals to form compounds, while the last one Bi is a metal, and can react with non-metals to form compounds, which will be discussed in the following section. GaN as the third-generation semiconductor material has attracted extensive research. Wu et al.201 synthesized GaN nanofibers via a simple electrospinning technique, assembled single GaN nanofiber-based FET devices, and proved the sensitivity to UV detection.
Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms, including white phosphorus and red phosphorus, which are seldom used for photodetectors. However, black phosphorene has attracted enormous amounts of attention very recently, due to strong anisotropy, high mobility up to 1000 cm2 V−1 s−1, and a direct bandgap ranging from 0.3 eV to 2 eV depending on the number of layers, broadband photoresponse in the visible and near infrared ranges.202 However, the stability of BP under ambient conditions hindered its actual application, due to its reactivity to oxygen and water resulting in a rapid degradation of its electronic and optical properties, and several methods have been reported to protect BP.45,203,204 Guo et al.34 produced black phosphorene with excellent water stability, controllable size and layer number, and in high yield via a facile liquid exfoliation method, which greatly promoted the development of black phosphorene. Furthermore, a self-powered photodetector was fabricated by such large-size 2D BP nanosheets, and showed a responsivity of 2.2 μA W−1 and high stability under alkaline conditions.205 A BP heterojunction was built to improve its weak response to visible light.206 InP is an important III–V semiconductor, and facile routes for the fabrication of InP NWs with the help of surfactants are accepted.222,223 Kwak et al.207 reported InP QD/BP hybrid photodetectors, and obtained a high responsivity of 109 A W−1, ultrahigh detectivity of 4.5 × 1016 Jones, and rise and decay times of 5 ms and 120 ms. Layered 2D materials As, Sb, and Bi exfoliated NS via aqueous shear exfoliation using kitchen blenders were reported by Gusmao et al.123 However, the further photodetector applications of As and Sb are seldom mentioned. 2D Bi NS prepared by the sonication approach were reported by Huang et al.208 and a responsivity of 1.8 μA W−1 and rise and fall times of 0.9 s and 0.38 s were obtained. Some representative materials and device structures from group VA are shown in Fig. 3 together with the data listed in Table 1. Although few research studies about solution-processed Group VA based photo-active materials are present, there is still much room for researchers to explore.

4.3. Group VIA based photo-active materials
A number of studies focus on group VIA elements, which contain oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and polonium (Po) in the periodic table of the elements (Fig. 1), because two main semiconductors including metal oxides209 and TMDCs,210,211 are listed. Wide band-gap oxide semiconductors, including ZnO, TiO2, SnO2, PbO, Ga2O3, NiO and so on, are the star materials of current research. The outstanding merits of stability, environmental friendliness, enrichment of raw materials, low cost, excellent carrier mobilities, mechanical stress tolerance, compatibility with organic photo-active materials, and high optical transparency are observed. For example, ZnO has a wide band gap of 3.3 eV and tunable nanostructured morphologies, and attracts intense interest in recent years. Jin et al.212 reported the fabrication of “metal–semiconductor–metal” (MSM) UV photodetectors by using solution-processed ZnO nanocrystalline films with a responsivity of 61 A W−1, and rise and fall times of <0.1 s and about 1 s, respectively. Djurišić et al. carefully reviewed the ZnO nanostructures for optoelectronics.213 Dr Buddha Deka Boruah214 summarized ZnO UV PDs in detail, including nanostructure morphologies, ZnO heterojunction structures with inorganic and organic materials, and architectural device design. Various ZnO nanostructures including 3D (microflowers, hierarchical superstructures, superstructures, hierarchical structures, etc.), 2D (nanosheets, nanoflakes, nanodisks, mesoporous single-crystal sheets, etc.), 1D (NWs, NRs, NTs, NBs, etc.) and 0D (QDs, NPs, core–shell structures, hollow spheres, etc.) have been carefully reviewed. However, ZnO nanostructure-based PDs suffer from a seriously slow photoresponse speed from a few seconds to minutes. Therefore, ZnO nanostructures doped with the other elements, heterojunction structures and new device structures were mentioned. For example, Sarkar et al.215 reported ZnO rods and CdS heterojunction photodetectors with an improved on/off ratio of 2.8 × 103 at ultraviolet zones and rise and fall times of 20 and 40 ms, respectively. Another widely reported metal oxide example is TiO2 semiconductors,94 which have a wide band gap (anatase 3.2 eV and rutile 3.0 eV), high photoconversion efficiency, and photostability, and can be prepared by the sol–gel method to fabricate MSM UV photodetectors. The fabricated devices showed only 1.9 nA at 5 V and a high photoresponsivity of 199 A W−1 under 260 nm laser irradiation, and a slow rise time and decay time of 6 s and 15 s, respectively due to the defect traps of nanocrystals. The highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays prepared by electrochemical anodization were reported by Zou et al.216 The obtained one-dimensional TiO2 nanostructure showed more attractive photodetection performance with a responsivity of 13 A W−1 under 1.06 mW cm−2 UV (λ = 312 nm) illumination at a bias voltage of 2.5 V and rise time and decay times of 0.5 s and 0.7 s, respectively because of its large specific surface area interface and well-defined charge carrier transport path. For the purpose of enhancing the responsivity and shortening the response, carbon nanotubes,217 BiOCl nanosheets,218 Se,219 were used to fabricated hybrid heterojunctions with TiO2 nanotube arrays. Tin oxide (SnO2) is an important metal oxide for UV photodetectors because of the high electronic mobility (∼100–200 cm2 V−1 s−1) and large band gap (3.6–3.8 eV).220 Chen et al. reported 2D ordered semiconducting monolayer SnO2 nanonets with the help of polymer nanofilm templates, and showed a dark current of 89.9 μA and a photocurrent current of 375.2 μA at 1.0 V. SnO2 and TiO2 heterojunction nanostructures combining fast electron transport, slow interfacial electron recombination, as well as effective light absorption, are widely reported to improve the performance of PEC type UV photodetectors.221–224 Other compounds such as ZnO,225 CdS,226 Cu2O,227 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)228 were also used to construct heterojunctions with SnO2. PbO was theoretically analyzed by M. Z. Kabir to be an excellent X-ray imaging detector candidate.229 Huang et al.230 reported orthorhombic β-PbO QDs prepared by a facile liquid phase exfoliation, obtaining a homogeneous distribution of the lateral size (3.2 ± 0.9 nm) and thickness (2.5 ± 0.5 nm) QDs. The photoelectrochemical (PEC)-type devices exhibited significantly improved photodetection performance, with a photoresponsivity of 4.28 mA W−1 at 0.637 mW cm−2 under a 400 nm laser in 0.01 M KOH and rise and decay times of 0.09–0.27 s and 0.13–0.39 s, respectively. 2D PbO nanosheets fabricated by the same method, showed a photoresponsivity value of 1.27 mA W−1 at 0.4 V, 7.64 × 108 Jones (0 V) for 365 nm light, and ∼0.1 s rise and fall times.231 Ga2O3, one of the widest bandgap semiconductor oxides (≈4.5–4.9 eV), attracts extensive attention as DUV solar-blind (200–280 nm) PDs.232,233 Highly monodisperse γ-Ga2O3 nanospheres were obtained by a facile hydrothermal reaction. The light–dark ratio (LDR) of 2.29 × 103, rise time and decay time of 0.1 s were obtained in 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 solution.234 Nickel oxide (NiO) is also a promising p-type semiconductor with a wide band gap (3.2 eV–3.8 eV), and the merits of low cost, earth abundance, non-toxicity, and transparency in visible light. p-NiO/n-ZnO heterojunction based UV photodetectors were widely investigated.235,236 2D NiO NS/GaN heterojunctions obtained by a low-temperature aqueous method to fabricate self-powered ultraviolet PD were also reported, with a photoresponsivity of 0.5 mA W−1, a rise and decay time of 40 ms.237 Other prominent metal oxide examples are ZrO2,238 Nb2O591 and even ternary metal oxides like SrTiO3,239,240 GdNiO3,241 InGaZnO,242 Zn1−xMgxO (x = 0–0.1),243 Zn2GeO4 and In2Ge2O7.244
Metal chalcogenides have sparked enormous interest in recent years because of their unique optical, electrical, physical and chemical properties, including high carrier mobility, high transparency, large specific surface area, good flexibility and a wide-spectrum range from UV to terahertz frequencies. Metal chalcogenides can be written as MX (M = transition metals from group IIIB to group IIB, and six different post-transition metals (Ga, In, Tl, Sn, Pb, Bi), X = S, Se or Te) and alloys and heterostructures of these materials. Taking Pb as an example, Konstantatos et al.245 reported PbS colloidal QD nanocrystal-based photodetectors with a photoconductive responsivity of 103 A W−1 and a detectivity of 1.8 × 1013 Jones. Sarasqueta et al.246 reported PbSe colloidal nanocrystal fabricated infrared photodetectors, achieving low dark currents and good photoresponse performance. PbTe-based single-crystalline NWs prepared by an electrochemistry method was prepared, and the related photodetector achieved a responsivity of 2.7 μA W−1, and a detectivity of 1.95 × 107 Jones at a bias voltage of 5 V with slow rise and fall times of 13 s and 6 s, respectively.247 The typical TMDCs210,248 are layered materials with strong in-plane bonding and weak out-of-plane interactions, combined by van der Waals forces and enabling exfoliation into 2D single layers, such as MoS2,249 MoSe2,250 and MoTe2.251 Because there exist extensive reviews about TMDCs,252–254 limiting the size of the review, one example is worthwhile to be mentioned in this part. Velusamy et al.250 reported amine-terminated polymer assisted liquid exfoliation of MoSe2 NSs and obtained an ON/OFF photocurrent ratio of 105, a detectivity of 4 × 1012 Jones, a responsivity of 16 A W−1 and a response time of 100 ms under 1064 nm laser illumination, and the photocurrent and photo-detectivity of the MoS2/MoSe2 (5:5) composite film arising from NIR almost linearly decreased while those from visible light increase with an increasing mixing amount of MoS2. Ternary and quaternary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals such as CdSSe,255 CuInSe2,256 SnS2−xSex,257 Bi2O2Se.258,259 are also reported. Aldakov et al. carefully reviewed multinary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals.260 It is interesting that selenium nanostructures such as nanospheres,261 nanosheets,262 nanotubes or nanowires263 were obtained by low cost wet-chemistry methods. For example, Xing et al.262 reported 2D nonlayered Se nanosheets through a facile liquid-phase exfoliation method. 2D Te nanosheets were obtained by the same method and demonstrated a photoresponsivity of 13.4 μA W−1 and a detectivity of 3.1 × 107 at 0.6 V under 350 nm light.264 Huang et al. reported Te@Se roll-to-roll nanotube heterojunctions synthesized by the wet-chemistry method through the epitaxial growth of Se on Te nanotubes which significantly outperform the PEC performance of the 2D Te nanosheets.265 Some corresponding materials and device structures from group VIA are shown in Fig. 4 together with the selected data listed in Table 1.

5. Inorganic and organic hybrid photo-active materials
5.1. Perovskites based hybrid photo-active materials
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have shown excellent performance and became a research “hot spot” in photovoltaic cells, light emitting devices and photodetectors.35,266–270 The excellent solution-processing characteristics, superior charge-transfer properties, tunable bandgaps and great light-harvesting ability make it as one of the most promising low-cost alternatives to traditional semiconductors. The chemical structure of perovskites is described by the formula ABX3, where the larger cation A is organic (e.g. CH3NH3+, CH(NH2)2+), the anion X is a halogen (generally I−, while Br− and Cl− usually in a mixed halide material). For efficient perovskite devices, cation B is universally Pb. Other metals such as Sn,268 Sr,269 Cu271 and Ca272 are used to replace Pb to avoid its toxicity. Perovskite materials can be directly regarded as inorganic and organic hybrid materials and applied as photo-active materials in photodetectors. The heterojunction structure between perovskite materials and inorganic or organic materials can be constructed to decrease the binding energy.

5.1.1. Perovskites and Pb-free perovskites. 
There are two solution-processed methods to fabricate perovskite thin films including the “one-step” method and “two-step” method. For example, the “one-step” method means the dissolution of PbI2 and CH3NH3I with a fixed molar ratio in an organic solvent and then followed by spin-coating and annealing to produce CH3NH3I3 perovskite, while the “two-step” method involves sequential steps of spin-coating PbI2 solution and drying, followed by dipping the dried PbI2 film in a CH3NH3I solution and drying. The performances of the photodetector with hybrid structures are carefully summarized in Table 2.

The first perovskite based broadband photodetector was reported by Hu et al., depositing a CH3NH3I3 film even on a flexible substrate by a “one-step” method.273 The perovskite photodetector was suitable for a broadband wavelength, showing a photo-responsivity of 3.49 A W−1 (ultraviolet light) and 0.0367 A W−1 (visible light), an EQE of 1.19 × 103% and 5.84% at 365 nm and 780 nm under 3 V bias, respectively. Wang et al. spin-coated CH3NH3PbBr3−xIx and CH3NH3PbI3 thin films onto the interdigitated patterned Au electrodes, obtained a high on–off ratio, a high responsivity of 55 mA W−1 and a fast response time of less than 20 μs.274 Inspired by the photovoltaic application of solution-processable perovskites, Dou et al. demonstrated a novel solution-processed hybrid perovskite photodetector by a “one-step” method.275 They held the view that the merits of perovskites films including high absorption coefficient, high EQE, long charge carrier lifetime and diffusion length, strongly indicated that the hybrid perovskite materials were ideal candidates for photodetector applications. Based on the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/PCBM/(none or BCP or PFN)/Al, they reported high performances with a very high detectivity of 8 × 1013 Jones at −100 mV, a linear dynamic range of over 100 dB and small noise currents at low bias. Qin et al. reported that single crystals of CH3NH3PbI3 were successfully prepared by a “two-step” method including a simple solution immersion method.276 To further improve the crystal growth and increase the grain size of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal, Liu et al. introduced alcohol-vapor solvent annealing treatment to obtain a high quality perovskite thin film.277 The highest responsivity of 2.71 A W−1 and detectivity of 3.4 × 1013 Jones with a light intensity of 0.48 mW cm−2 and at a bias of −0.5 V, a LDR of 105 dB were achieved.
The solution deposited film can simplify the procedure of fabrication at a low cost. It is a key point to understand the mechanism of the film-forming process and control over the crystallization process.278,279 Shen et al. proved that the substrate and the solvent had a big influence on the final perovskite film morphology together with the crystal size, uniformity and surface coverage.280 The high quality film morphology with less defects (pin holes and grain boundaries) can decrease the possibility of recombination between the separated hole and electron, and then increase the carrier concentration, mobility, and diffusion length.281 Different solvents and synthesis strategies can change the dimensionality of perovskite to 0D QDs, 1D NW, 2D nanosheets or nanoplates (NS or NP) and 3D large size crystals or film. The nano-dimensional structures would lead to the transformation of the continuous density of states (DOS) of the bulk solid to the discrete electronic states because of their quantum confinement (QC) effects.282
The excitons of 0D perovskite QDs are confined in all three spatial dimensions, leading to the possibility of tuning its energy band by its size and shape, exhibiting unique electronic and optical properties. Meanwhile, 0D perovskite QDs have a large specific surface area that can promote the light adsorption, profitable to photodetectors. The ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method and hot injection method are widely applied to synthesize perovskite QDs.283,284 Levchuk et al. reported a facile and rapid room temperature synthesis of formamidinium CH(NH2)2PbX3 colloidal nanocrystals by LARP, which showed high photoluminescence quantum yield, colloidal and thermodynamic stability without degradation in water.285 The hot injection process is injecting a polar solvent containing inorganic lead into a nonpolar solvent containing coordinating ligands to stabilize the generated particles. Jang et al. reported the ultrasound-induced synthesis of perovskite nanocrystals in toluene, and fabricated high-sensitivity photodetectors on large-area silicon oxide substrates.286 The 0D perovskite QDs are widely combined with other materials together to construct heterojunction photodetectors, which we will discuss in the perovskite and inorganic hybrid heterojunction part.
1D single-crystalline perovskite nanowires are confined in two spatial dimensions, therefore, possesses several advantages over their thin film counterparts for photodetection application. Such one-dimensional nanostructures can reduce grain boundaries, thus promoting charge flow within the single-crystalline channel, utilizing the morphological anisotropy to detect polarized light, having great possibilities to construct highly flexible photodetectors because of the excellent mechanical properties of nanowires or nanorods. The 1D MAPbI3 NW with a mean diameter of 50 and 400 nm and length up to 10 μm were prepared through a simple slip-coating approach, and the unique role of DMF that has a boiling point as a growth-directing agent was confirmed.287 They achieved a responsivity of 5 mA W−1 and a fast on–off current less than 500 μs. Deng et al. applied the same method with the help of vapor-assisted crystallization to develop the aligned growth of single-crystalline perovskite NWs.288,289 The high responsivity (1.25 × 104 A W−1), detectivity (1.73 × 1011 Jones), and linear dynamic range (150 dB) were comparable with standard perovskite-based photodetectors. Deng et al. fabricated perovskite NWs by a one-step self-assembly solution method and obtained uniform NW distribution and alignment with patterning deposition on substrates.290 The great PD performances reached 1.32 A W−1 for responsivity, 2.5 × 1012 Jones for detectivity and 0.3 ms for response speed. Gao et al. carefully engineered passivation of CH3NH3PbI3 NW to avoid the surface electronic trap states and CH3NH3PbI3 decomposition due to moisture and light exposure.291 They reported great performance of less than 0.1 ms response time, 4.95 A W−1 responsivity, and 2 × 1013 Jones detectivity. To accelerate the commercialization applications of perovskite in electronic and optoelectronic devices, ordered and large-area CH3NH3PbI3 NW array thin films were fabricated by large-scale roll-to-roll (R2R), micro-gravure printing and doctor blading in ambient environments by Hu et al.292 The performance of the CH3NH3PbI3 NW array photodetector fabricated on SiO2 by R2R or doctor blading is about 5.20 mA W−1.
2D semiconductor materials, confined in one spatial dimension, have attracted considerable attention during the past years due to their strong size effects and sizable band gaps that are critical for various optoelectronic applications. The typical 2D perovskite materials include nanosheets and nanoplatelets. Weidman et al. carefully reviewed the methods of synthesizing typical colloidal halide perovskite 2D nanoplatelets.293 They summarized some important solution processing methods such as the solid state crystallization method,294 exfoliation method,295 hot-injection crystallization method,296 and nonsolvent crystallization.297 Liu et al. reported a combined solution process and vapor-phase conversion method to synthesize high-quality ultrathin 2D hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) nanocrystals with a thickness down to a single unit cell (∼1.3 nm).298 They proved a two step process which included casting saturated PbI2 aqueous solution onto a substrate and subsequently heating the substrate at a temperature from 30 to 180 °C to form 2D PbI2 NS nuclei. In the second step, the 2D CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite NS were grown by intercalating the CH3NH3I molecules into the interval sites of PbI6 octahedron layers through a CVD method. Thus, as the formed perovskite film still maintains the 2D lamellar structure, indicating good morphology retention. The 2D perovskite-based photodetector showed a great photoresponsivity of 22 A W−1 with a voltage bias of 1 V and fast rise and decay times that are shorter than 20 and 40 ms. Li et al. developed 2D layered hybrid high-quality large-size single crystals grown by the temperature lowering method from saturated solution.299 The thickness is in the range of 80–200 μm with an average value of ∼150 μm and the roughness is about ∼250 nm. The crystal-based photodetector exhibited fascinating performances, including extremely low dark currents (10−12 A), large on/off current ratios (2.5 × 103), and very fast response rate (150 μs). Other new 2D hybrid perovskite candidates have been developed by some groups. Ge et al. reported a two step seed crystal growing method to fabricate 2D perovskite (PEA)2PbBr4 single crystal plates.300 They reported a significantly low dark current (5.56 × 10−13 A) under a bias of 2.0 V and high on/off ratio (103) at a laser power intensity of 0.1 mW cm−2. Xu et al. reported 2D perovskite crystals (PA)2(G)Pb2I7 (where PA = n-pentylaminium and G = guanidinium) array photodetectors having nanosecond-responsivity.301 A great performance including high photodetectivity (6.3 × 1012 Jones), responsivities (≈47 A W−1), low dark current (≈2.4 × 10−11 A) and especially ultrafast response time (3.1 ns) was obtained.
The 3D big size single-crystalline perovskite or polycrystalline film without any spatial dimension confinement are also widely reported. Dong et al. reported excellent diffusion lengths of CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals exceeding 175 micrometers, which were grown by a solution-growth method.302 Han et al. proved a large 5 mm sized single crystal FAPbI3via a novel liquid-based crystallization method and the single crystal contained a δ-phase to α-phase transition when heat was applied.303 The single crystal had a great carrier mobility (4.4 cm2 V−1 s−1) with a long lifetime of 484 ns. The NEP of the photoconductor-type photodetector devices was ≈2.6 × 10−14 W at 380 nm and the rise and fall times were 12.4 and 17.2 ms. Lin et al. also reported large size single crystals including CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 prepared by an inverse temperature crystallization method.304 The reported CH3NH3PbI3 based photoresistor showed a responsivity close 10−2 A W−1 at 0.5 V under 0.2 mW cm−1. Ye et al. reported a new seed dissolution-regrowth (SDR) method to synthesize high-quality c-MAPbI3, removing unfavorable defects.305 The great performance of responsivity, EQE, and D* for the c-MAPbI3 photodetector was achieved with values of about 2.6 × 104 mA W−1, 5700%, and 1.8 × 1015 Jones. Most of the universal solution processing strategies, especially the “one-step” method and following assistant steps such as thermal annealing, solvent annealing, and atmospheric and solvent control will induce polycrystalline films. Dong et al. prepared CH3NH3PbI3 polycrystalline films by a two step interdiffusion method.306 The related photodetectors exhibited a very high responsivity of 242 A W−1 at −1 V bias, an LDR of 85 dB and a NEP of 0.18 pW. Hu et al. synthesized high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films by a solvent-induced crystallization method, and achieved an EQE of 4.1 × 104%, a detectivity of 3.1 × 1012 Jones and a responsivity of 219 A W−1 at 1 V bias.307
Pb-free perovskites have attracted extensive attention because there is growing concern about the toxicity of lead and operational stability of organic lead halide perovskites. The great challenge is to replace the lead with a less toxic metal in the perovskite crystal structures. The most viable replacements for Pb in the perovskite material are Sn and Ge, which are members of the group IVA metals.308,309 Volonakis et al. reported computational screening of the hypothetical halide double perovskites based on bismuth or antimony and noble metal perovskites such as Bi, Sb.310 Kagan fabricated semiconducting perovskite (C6H5C2H4NH3)2SnI4 in a thin-film field-effect transistor device via a spin coating method with a high ION/IOFF of more than 104.311 Qian et al. reported (PEA)2SnI4 deposited onto the flexible electrodes by spin-coating for high performance flexible photoconductors.312 The devices showed a photoresponsivity of ∼16 A W−1 at a bias voltage of 5 V, a detectivity (D*) of 1.92 × 1011 Jones and a rise time and fall time of 630 ms and 3600 ms. Ji et al. reported a new lead-free organic and inorganic hybrid perovskite with large-size high-quality single crystals (TMHD) BiBr5 (TMHD = N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-1,6-hexanediammonium).313 The photodetector showed sizeable on/off current ratios (≈103), a responsivity of 100 mA W−1, an EQE of ∼50% and rapid rise and decay times of 8.9 ms and 10.2 ms.
All-inorganic structure perovskites such as CsPbBr3 have become hot topics in recent years by replacing the unstable organic part with an inorganic cation.314,315 The first photodetector devices based on all-inorganic CsPbI3 were demonstrated by Ramasamy et al.316 and a good on/off photocurrent ratio of 105 and relatively fast rise and decay times of 24 ms and 29 ms are exhibited. Song et al. reported 2D ultrathin nanosheet inorganic perovskites317 with a thickness of about 3.3 nm via a simple solution-phase method. The related photodetector showed an EQE of 54%, a high on/off photocurrent ratio of >104, a responsivity of 0.64 A W−1 and a rise time and decay time of 19 and 25 μs. Song et al.318 reported a space-confined growth strategy to control the nucleation and growth dynamics of CsPbBr3 crystals. Finally, a record detectivity of 7.55 × 1013 Jones, a high linear detection range of 101 dB, a high responsivity of 216 A W−1 and ultrashort response time of <5 μs were achieved. Zheng et al.319 reported Cs3Sb2Br9 perovskite nanoflake photodetectors and demonstrated a high performance including fast response speed (24/48 ms), high responsivity (3.8 A W−1) and excellent detectivity (2.6 × 1012 Jones).


5.1.2. Perovskites and inorganic hybrid heterojunction. 
Heterojunctions are widely built in the fields of photodetectors, photovoltaics and photocatalysis to manipulate and tune the charge carrier transport in photo-active materials, which is critical to the photoconversion efficiency enhancement.320–323 Because there exist three photophysical processes when a photodetector works: (1) charge carrier generation by incident light, (2) transportation of charge carriers, as well as (3) separation and extraction of charge carriers to provide an output signal of current. As for photo-active materials, heterogeneous interfaces can effectively separate charge carriers pairs and hinder the charge recombination according to photo-induced charge transfer (PICT) dynamics theory.324,325 However, inappropriate heterojunction material arrangement would result in serious recombination losses, because unsuitable interfacial energy band structures would form undesired energy barriers and hinder the charge transportation. Therefore, it is very important to choose two components carefully to realize controllable arrangement of various heterojunctions. By construction of 2D perovskite films and 1D carbon nanotube composites, Li et al.326 achieved a high-performance photodetector with an EQE of 7488%, a responsivity of 31.1 A W−1 and a rise time and decay time of 16 and 38 μs. There exist extensive reports about heterojunctions constructed from perovskites and 2D materials such as graphene and TMDCs because of their unique structures as well as interesting optoelectronic properties. Chen et al.327 and Shi et al.328 thoroughly summarized the recent progress of perovskites and 2D material heterojunctions. Lee et al. reported CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite/graphene hybrid photodetectors due to the broad absorption band of graphene and the high absorption cross-section of perovskite films.329 Owing to the efficient charge transfer between graphene and perovskite, the high-performance perovskite/graphene hybrid photodetector showed a photoresponsivity of 180 A W−1, an effective quantum efficiency of ∼5 × 104%, a photo-detectivity of ∼109 Jones, and a broad spectral bandwidth across the UV-Vis range. TMDCs have merits of tunable bandgaps, long carrier diffusion lengths, high EQE values and low driving currents, which can effectively suppress the dark current and promote charge separation in photodetectors. Wang et al. fabricated solution-processed heterostructures consisting of 2D MoS2 NS by using chemical exfoliation and perovskite.330 The multi-layered MoS2/CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid photodetector devices exhibited a responsivity of 142 A W−1, an EQE of 3.5 × 104%, a detectivity of 2.6 × 1011 Jones, a rise time less than 25 ms and a decay time less than 50 ms. There are also CH3NH3PbI3/WS2 or CH3NH3PbI3/WSe2 heterostructure photoconductors reported because of better band alignment with the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite.331,332
It is well known that metal oxides have much high carrier mobility and superior stability, together with feasible solution processing possibilities. Thus, metal oxides have been widely investigated as p-type or n-type semiconductor materials for optoelectronic applications.209 Tin dioxide (SnO2), which is a cheap and environmentally friendly n-type metal oxide semiconductor material, has been applied to construct p–n junctions together with perovskite materials to increase the exciton dissociation efficiency.333 A high responsivity of 1.65 A W−1, a detectivity of 1012 Jones and about 10 ms rise and decay times are obtained. SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid structure flexible photodetectors were also fabricated.334 They showed a fast decay time less than 0.4 s and a high ION/IOFF of 234. Cao et al. reported a self-powered CH3NH3PbICl2/ZnO photodetector, and achieved a response speed of 0.2 s, an on–off ratio of 2800, a responsivity of 0.67 A W−1, and a detectivity of 1013 Jones, respectively.335 To improve on/off ratio or response speed, Yi et al. designed a solution-processed TiO2 nanocrystal (NC) film that was employed to transport photocarriers and obtained a CH3NH3PbI3 bilayer photodetector device.336 The CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 bilayer photodetector showed high performance with an on/off ratio of 4000, a photo-detectivity of 1.85 × 1012 Jones, and rise and decay times of 0.49 s and 0.56 s. To further decrease heterojunction interface barrier resistance, Khan reported a tri-component perovskite photodetector with a layer of interfacial dipole material.337 The device exhibited excellent performances with a low dark current of 1.5 × 10−11 A, a photo-detectivity of 1.51 × 1012 Jones, an on–off ratio of 2700, a rise/decay time of 0.49/1.17 s, and a linear dynamic range (LDR) of 68.6 dB. Yi et al. designed CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2/Si tri-component hybrid photodetectors, which exhibited a fairly high on/off ratio of 6.0 × 103 and D* of 4.85 × 1013 Jones, as well as a decent R of 62.5 A W−1.338 Sun et al. reported double-twisted CH3NH3PbI3–TiO2-coated carbon fiber and CuO–Cu2O–Cu wire double twisted self-powered photodetectors with an on/off ratio of 393, a detectivity of 2.15 × 1013 Jones, and a responsivity of 562.9 mA W−1, respectively.339
Metal chalcogenides are also widely applied to photodetector systems. To achieve narrow-bandgap adsorption, PbS QDs and CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid structures have been successfully utilized to fabricate photodetectors due to the merits of solution processability, size-tunable spectral sensitivity, as well as flexible substrate compatibility.340 They showed 1012 Jones in visible light, 1011 Jones in NIR light, an EQE of 38%@0 V and a fast response and decay time less than 500 ms. Liu et al. reported PbS QD and CH3NH3PbI3 bilayer structures, showing a high responsivity over 300 mA W−1 and high detectivities exceeding 1013 Jones in the visible region and a high responsivity over 130 mA W−1 and high detectivities exceeding 5 × 1012 Jones in near infrared region, respectively.341 CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and PbSe colloidal quantum dot heterojunction field effect phototransistors were reported by Yu et al.342 Cao et al. reported a high-performance self-powered photodetector based on CH3NH3PbI3/CdS, which exhibited a large responsivity (0.48 A W−1), a high detectivity (2.1 × 1013 Jones), and a fast response speed (0.54/2.21 ms) under 700 nm light illumination.343 Zhang et al. reported multilayer PtSe2 and FA0.85Cs0.15PbI3 perovskite heterojunction self-driven photodetectors, which exhibited a large Ilight/Idark ratio of 5.7 × 103, a high responsivity of 117.7 mA W−1, a detectivity of 2.6 × 1012 Jones, and an ultrafast response speed of 78/60 ns.344
Perovskite QDs have a size tunable band gap (from 3.1 to 1.7 eV), high photoluminescence (PL), and large extinction coefficient, can easily mix with other dimensional materials to construct heterojunctions. Wang et al. reported MAPbI3 and nanocrystalline graphite hybrid composites, achieving a relatively high detectivity of 795 mA W−1 and a fall and rise time of less than 25 ms.345 Zheng et al. reported a horizontal TiO2 NTs/MAPbI3 QD heterostructure through a spin-coating process.157 It exhibited a responsivity of 189 mA W−1, a detectivity of 3.8 × 1011 Jones, rise and fall times of 7 and 4 seconds at the light of 700 nm and 1 V bias. Wu et al. reported perovskite QDs and MoS2 single layers to obtain 0D–2D mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures. The results of photoresponsivity up to 5.5 × 104 A W−1, and specific detectivity of 1.95 × 1012 Jones, and fast rise/decay time (2.9 ns/6.2 ns) were achieved.346 All-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals have emerged as a new class of materials and have attracted great attention. Zhang et al. carefully summarized the recent progress, opportunities and challenges and the related heterojunction structures.347


5.1.3. Perovskites and organic hybrid heterojunction. 
Organic semiconductors have unique properties relative to traditional inorganic materials, including simple synthesis, tunable electronic properties, low cost, large-scale and high-speed fabrication, and adaptability to low-temperature processing on flexible substrates, showing great potential for next-generation flexible electronic and photoelectronic devices.348 The combination of perovskites and organic semiconductors has the possibility to utilize the virtues of both materials. Lin et al. reported rhodamine B:CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx combination photo-active layers to deliver a narrowband red photodiode and polyethylenimine ethoxylated:CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx photo-active layers for blue and green photodiodes.349 The performance delivered >10% EQE at a modest −1 V reverse bias, a LDR of 120 dB, very fast rise and fall times around several μs. Teng et al. further fabricated CH3NH3PbI3/rhodamine B flexible photodetectors, which showed a higher responsivity of about 43.6 mA W−1, considerable switching on–off characteristics (Ion/Ioff ≈ 286), and fast rise/decay times (60 ms/40 ms).350 Polyoxometalates were also added to the precursor solution of CH3NH3PbI3 to prepare bulk heterojunction photo-active layers.351 Xie et al. reported CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite and PEDOT:PSS bilayer heterojunction composite structures, and obtained a responsivity of 4.0 × 109 A W−1, a specific detectivity of 1.4 × 1014 Jones at 0.5 V operating voltage and high rise and fall times of 4.5 and 57.5 s because of the ultrahigh gain.352 Other n-type organic semiconductor materials like poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole-terthiophene) (PDPP3T),353 and dioctylbenzothieno [2,3-b] benzothiophene (C8BTBT)354 are also developed to construct a p–n heterojunction photoconductive layer. Xie et al. even reported CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite/P3HT/graphene multiheterojunction phototransistors, exhibiting a record responsivity of ∼4.3 × 109 A W−1.355

5.2. Inorganic and organic hybrid heterojunction-based photo-active materials
Even though inorganic photo-active materials have a high charge-carrier mobility, a small exciton binding energy, as well as high stability, commercial inorganic photodetectors still suffer from complicated and expensive manufacturing processes and mechanical inflexibilities. Inorganic and organic hybrid heterojunctions can efficiently utilize the merits of organic semiconductors to achieve large-area, low-cost and flexible photodetector devices. Inorganic materials based on chalcogenides are widely investigated because they are typically p-type semiconductors. Solution-processed n-type metal oxide semiconductors such as ZnO, TiO2, and SnO2 have been extensively studied for photodetectors in the UV spectral range. The p–n heterojunctions consisting of solution-processed n-type ZnO and a p-type polymer such as poly(9,9-dihexylfluorene) (PFH),356 polyfluorene (PFO),357 poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK),358 polypyrrole (PPy),359 polyaniline (PANI),360 poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),361 and PEDOT:PSS,362 are widely reported. For example, Ouyang et al. reported a self-powered UV photodetector with the configuration of the p-P3HT/n-ZnO nanowire array heterojunction, which displayed a responsivity of 125 A W−1, a detectivity of 3.7 × 107 Jones, rise and decay times less than 100 ms at a low light intensity of 0.84 mW cm−2.361 The TiO2 heterojunction has received considerable research attention because of high electron injection efficiency from the excited organic molecules and good chemical stability. The successful examples are poly(9,9-dihexylfluorene) (PFH),363 polyfluorene (PFO),364 spiro-MeOTAD,365 and polyaniline (PANI).366 Bai et al. reported an ultraviolet photodetector based on spiro-OMeTAD/mesoporous TiO2/compact TiO2, which exhibited a fast response time of <0.02 s, an EQE of 6.67%, a high detectivity of 3.5 × 1013 Jones and a responsivity of 18.29 mA W−1 at 340 nm light wavelength and a bias voltage of 0.60 V.365 Other configurations of PEDOT:PSS/SnO2 heterojunction photodetectors were also reported by Li et al.367 Metal sulfide nanocrystals (especially PbS,368 CdS369 and Sb2S3370) and organic semiconductor heterojunction photodetectors have attracted some attention because of their unique optical properties. Rauch et al. reported PbS–QDs:P3HT and PbS–QDs:P3HT:PCBM hybrid bulk heterojunction photodiodes for the first time, and an EQE of 16.5%, a responsivity of 0.16 A W−1, and rise and fall times of 69 ms and 91 ms were obtained. Noise analysis indicated a noise equivalent power of 8.7 × 10−11 W and a normalized detectivity of 2.3 × 109 Jones at a modulation frequency of 170 Hz.371 Lin et al. reported p–n heterojunction nanowire arrays of CdS/PANI (polyaniline) for blue light photodetectors and CdS/poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) for green light with high-sensitivity and high-speed.372 As an important class of chalcogenides, metal selenides such as CdSe,373 CuSe374 and even the pure selenium375 constructed with a p-type polymer semiconductor to build a heterojunction are carefully investigated. Metal tellurides are also developed for organic–inorganic heterojunctions, such as Cu2Te/P3HT,376 Bi2Te3/pentacene.377 For example, the performance of Bi2Te3/pentacene heterojunction responsivity of the photodetector reached 14.89 A W−1, a detectivity of 7.8 × 1010 Jones, and a fast response time of 1.89 ms, along with the ultrahigh EQE of 2840%. Binary compounds from main groups V, Cd3P2378 and Cd3As2,379 have been developed with organic semiconductors due to their excellent high carrier mobility. The Cd3As2/pentacene thin film exhibited a high current responsivity (36.15 mA W−1), a responsivity of 1.55 m and an EQE of 7.29% at 650 nm wavelength. Xue et al.380 synthesized colloidal Ge nanocrystal/P3HT heterojunctions, and obtained an on/off ratio of >100. The typical hybrid structures are carefully shown in Fig. 5.

6. Conclusion and outlook
In this review, solution-processing techniques that are most relevant to the field of photodetectors and related semiconductor materials have been given with an overview at the current stage. In contrast to the conventional routes such as the vapor-assisted deposition method and other physical methods, the solution processing methods can greatly reduce the cost, improve large-scale production, and satisfy the application of wearable devices. Although the optoelectronic performance of these solution-processed devices is inferior to that of those fabricated by conventional routes at the moment, this can be tolerated for some applications in view of the above benefits and have great potential prospects. A large and dedicated amount of work is needed before the existing knowledge can be transferred to a large-scale solution-processing process.
As we have witnessed development efforts in the latest materials, the solution-processing process is extremely important. To reach a broad range or typical zone of wavelengths, high sensitivity, fast response, and device stability photodetectors, having large-scale, low cost and various promising potential applications, concerted interdisciplinary efforts and innovative technology by both scientists and engineers are extremely needed to provide new approaches toward solving critical issues. More efforts should be devoted to the following aspects: (i) inorganic nanomaterials have diverse morphologies such as 0D QDs, 1D tubes, rods, wires, 2D belts, sheets, flakes, plates, 3D nanoparticles and arrays, thus leading to totally different photodetection performances. Controllable liquid phase synthesis of nanomaterials with various structures and the structure–performance relationship behind should be carefully discerned. (ii) The heterojunction structure can efficiently separate the excitons with the help of a built-in potential, thus achieving high performance self-powered photodetectors. The construction of heterojunction structures by wet-chemistry synthesis and liquid phase processing is still a challenge at the moment and worthy of in-depth study. (iii) New hybrid device structures together with a low-cost large-scale coating or printing techniques in ink chemistry should be thoroughly considered. (iv) Compared with high-temperature growth techniques and device fabrication, liquid phase processing is extremely suitable for the fabrication of flexible photodetectors, which have great potential applications in large-area foldable displays, aerospace science, biological sensors, and wearable devices. Although this review cannot cover entire literatures about solution processing photodetectors, and many riddles need to be solved, we hope to give a general picture of the research efforts in this fields and demonstrate that solution processed photodetectors by low cost wet-chemistry methods will bring the prospect of a new era.
