    , Accepted 5th August 2021First published on 5th August 2021AbstractPhotocatalysts play a vital role in the process of harnessing and converting solar energy into storable and valuable chemical fuels. As a polymeric semiconductor, graphitic carbon nitride g-C3N4 has been regarded as a next-generation photocatalyst due to its appealing band structure and excellent physicochemical stability. However, low electron conductivity and weak visible light absorption hinder its practical application. In this work, for the first time, we rationally designed a new graphitic carbon nitride, g-C9N10, based on a self-doping strategy by substituting the C3N3 ring for bridging the N atom in g-C3N4. g-C9N10 exhibits higher electron conductivity and longer wavelength absorption than those of g-C3N4, which make it a highly photoactive photocatalyst. Moreover, on the basis of “acceptance and donation” mechanism, single boron atom-decorated g-C9N10 (B@g-C9N10) can act as an efficient metal-free photocatalyst for nitrogen reduction reactions (NRRs) with high faradaic efficiency. Our results demonstrate that B@g-C9N10 can effectively activate and reduce N2 to NH3 with a low overpotential of 0.22 V, while the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is efficiently suppressed. In addition, the photo-generated external potential is adequate to drive the NRR, endowing B@g-C9N10 with spontaneous NRR capability under visible/infrared light irradiation. This work may provide a new strategy for designing photocatalysts with high photoactivity and proposes g-C9N10 as a promising platform for designing efficient photocatalysts, which is expected to motivate more research efforts to explore.
Introduction
With the speeding up of industrialization and rapid growth of population, the increasing energy consumption and environmental issues have been attracting increasing attention for decades.1,2 At present, the world's energy supply is still strongly dependent on fossil fuels, which are being rapidly consumed and cause environmentally harmful emission. The exploitation of sustainable and environment-friendly energy has invigorated worldwide attention.3–5 Solar power is renewable and clean, and it is the most promising energy source in the 21st century. Since the discovery of electrochemical photolysis of water by Fujishima and Honda,6 photocatalysts have been regarded as an effective approach to harness and convert solar energy into storable and valuable chemical fuels including hydrogen and carbon-based fuels.7,8 In recent decades, a variety of photocatalysts such as TiO2,9,10 ZnO,11,12 CdS,13,14 BiWOx,15,16 and SnO2 (ref. 17) have been developed and explored. However, the metal oxide photocatalysts have low utilization rates of solar energy due to their large band gaps.3 Moreover, the metal sulfide or phosphide photocatalysts suffer from photo-corrosion and self-oxidation during the photocatalysis process.18,19 Thus, photocatalysts with high light utilization efficiency and stability are indeed demanded.
As a polymeric semiconductor, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is regarded as the next-generation photocatalyst due to its unique properties including facile synthesis, suitable band structure and excellent physicochemical stability.20–23 However, some intrinsic shortages such as low electron conductivity and poor visible light absorption above 460 nm hinder its practical application.24–26 To address these issues, various strategies involving noble metal doping,27,28 vacancy engineering and polymer modification29–32 have been used to enhance its photoactivity. Recently, the self-doping strategy is regarded as an effective approach to optimize the photoactivity of photocatalysts. The carbon self-doping g-C3N4 (C-g-C3N4) was theoretically proposed and experimentally synthesized.33 Due to the formation of the delocalized big π bond after the substitution of the bridging N atom with the C atom, the conductivity and visible light absorption of C-g-C3N4 are improved, and its photoactivity is enhanced.
In addition, another graphitic carbon nitride, g-CN (Fig. S1a†), formed by a C3N3 unit, has been successfully fabricated by a simple solvothermal method34 and various g-CN-supported single-atom catalysts (SAC) have been experimentally achieved for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic reactions,35–37 which demonstrates that the C3N3 ring is a stable unit and promising connector in graphitic carbon nitride. In addition, as an analogy of benzene, s-triazine (C3N3H3) has a delocalized π-electron along the C3N3 ring.38 Thus, substituting the bridging N atom in g-C3N4 with C3N3 holds great potential for improving the g-C3N4 photoactivity.
Dinitrogen conversion to NH3 is an important synthesis technique to sustain all forms of life.39–41 Photocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) is regarded as a promising way to replace the heavy energy-consuming Haber–Bosch process in industries.42,43 The sp2 hybridized B atom that contains both occupied and empty orbitals has been validated as an active site for N2 activation and reduction through the electron “acceptance and donation” process.39,43–46 In particular, the empty sp2 orbital can accept the lone-pair electrons from N2 to strengthen its fixation while the elections in the sp2 orbital can be back donated to the antibonding orbital of N2 to weaken the NN triple bond.
In the present study, we propose a new graphitic carbon nitride, g-C9N10 (see Fig. 1a and S1c†), by substituting the bridging of a nitrogen atom in the g-C3N4 atom with the C3N3 ring based on theoretical calculations. Inspired by the synthetic method of g-CN reported by Li et al.,34 shown in Fig. S1d,† we propose a feasible synthesis scheme for g-C9N10 by using commercially available heptazine chloride (C6N7Cl3) and cyanuric chloride (C3N3Cl3) serving as precursors to react with Na via a simple solvothermal method (see Fig. S1e†). Detailed descriptions are available in the ESI.† Comparing to ideal g-C3N4, g-C9N10 exhibits higher electron conductivity and longer wavelength absorption around 500 nm due to the formation of delocalized π bonds between substituted C3N3 and the hexatomic skeleton. In addition, g-C9N10 has a super large pore with abundant sp2 nitrogen atoms along the edge, which serves as a promising anchoring site for dopants. Furthermore, boron-decorated g-C9N10 (B@g-C9N10) was constructed. Excitingly, B@g-C9N10 exhibits excellent NRR performance with an overpotential of 0.22 V, while the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is efficiently suppressed. In addition, the photogenerated external potential is adequate to drive NRR. Therefore, the NRR can process spontaneously on B@g-C9N10 under visible/infrared light irradiation, indicating that B@g-C9N10 is a promising light-driven photocatalyst for NRRs.
Computational method
All spin-polarized DFT calculations were conducted using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).47,48 The projector augmented-wave (PAW) method49 and Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)50,51 functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) were applied to describe ionic cores and exchange–correlation energies, respectively. A cutoff energy of 500 eV was adopted and Grimme's third-generation dispersion correction method of DFT-D3 (ref. 52) was used to account for the van der Waals (vdW) interactions. The vacuum gap between periodic images was set to 15 Å. The convergence criteria for residual force and energy were set to 0.05 eV Å−1 and 10−5 eV, respectively. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 2 × 2 × 1 gamma centered special k points grid for geometry optimizations.53 Note that the band structure and optical simulation were performed by the HSE06 hybrid functional.54,55Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were carried out to assess the thermodynamic stability of the catalysts. VASPKIT56 and VESTA57 were used for data treatment and visualization, respectively.
The free energy profile for the NRR was obtained based on the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model proposed by Nørskov and co-workers.58,59 In this model, the free energy of the proton–electron pair is equal to that of 1/2H2(g). The free energy change for each elementary step was determined as follows: ΔG = ΔE + ΔEZPE − TΔS + neU(1)where ΔE is the electronic energy difference directly obtained from the DFT calculation. ΔEZPE is the variation of the zero-point energy (ZPE) and ΔS is the entropy (S) change, as shown in Table S1.†T is the temperature (T = 298.15 K) and neU is the free energy contribution of external electrode potential (U). The ZPE and S of NRR intermediates were obtained by the vibrational frequency analysis. For the molecules in gas phase, H2(g) and N2(g), the ZPE and S were taken from the NIST database.60
Result and discussion
It should be noted that ideal g-C3N4, consisting of heptazine units (C6N7) connected with 3-fold-coordinated nitrogen atoms, serves as a platform, which has been widely applied in various fields.33,44,61,62 In the present work, ideal g-C3N4 was taken as comparison to illustrate the self-doping effect. As shown in Fig. 1a, the initial structure of g-C9N10 was obtained from ideal g-C3N4 by substituting the bridging N atom with planar triazine (C3N3). After full-structure optimization without geometrical constraints along the a and b axis, new planar g-C9N10 without any buckling was obtained, as shown in Fig. 1a. The symmetry of g-C9N10 belongs to the Pm2 space group, the same as g-C3N4 and g-CN. The lattice constant of g-C9N10 is 9.42 Å, larger than that of g-C3N4 (7.13 Å) and g-CN (7.12 Å). In addition, the unit cell of g-C9N10, containing nine carbon atoms and ten nitrogen atoms, was formed by one heptazine (C6N7) and one triazine (C3N3) (Fig. 1a). Each C6N7 is connected to three C3N3 by a C–C bond with a bond length of 1.51 Å. Moreover, g-C9N10 has a much larger pore than g-C3N4 and g-CN, as displayed in Fig. S2.† In the present study, the diameter of the pore is defined as the maximum distance between the N atom in two anchoring sites. The pore diameter of g-C9N10 is 7.04 Å, much larger than that of g-C3N4 (4.13 Å) and g-CN (4.73 Å). The super large pore size may make g-C9N10 a promising platform for designing high-efficiency catalysts, since abundant sp2-bonded N atoms along the pore edge can act as a perfect anchoring site for the active center, such as metallic and nonmetallic dopant.63,64 In addition, the AIMD simulation of g-C9N10 was conducted to examine its thermal stability. It can be found that g-C9N10 maintains planar configuration without severe distortion or bond breaking at 500 K (Fig. 1b) and even at 1000 K (Fig. S3†) for 10 ps, demonstrating that g-C9N10 exhibits high thermal stability and shows great potential for experimental synthesis. Furthermore, the band gap of ideal g-C9N10 is 2.65 eV (Fig. 1c), which is about 0.1 eV lower than that of g-C3N4 (2.75 eV) (Fig. S4†).44,65 Meanwhile, the optical absorption of g-C9N10 is extended to 500 nm in the visible light region (Fig. 1d). Thus, with higher electron conductivity and stronger absorption of visible light than g-C3N4, g-C9N10 is promising to be employed as an efficient photocatalyst.

(b) Energy and temperature variation against AIMD time for 10 ps under 500 K. (c) The band structure of g-C9N10. (d) Absorption spectra of g-C3N4 (black line) and g-C9N10 (magenta line). 
In order to evaluate the catalytic activity of pristine g-C9N10 for the NRR, the critical step for NRR, N2 fixation and activation has been examined. Four possible active sites are shown in Fig. S5.† However, along with full-structure optimization, N2 on all sites depart away from the g-C9N10 surface with an average distance of 3.45 Å, indicating that the interactions between N2 and g-C9N10 are weak. In addition, N2 still remains inert with a bond length of 1.11 Å, the same as the one in gas-phase N2. Therefore, pristine g-C9N10 exhibits extremely poor catalytic performance for NRRs.
Transition metal compound was reported as an efficient NRR catalyst for the coexistence of empty d orbitals and occupied d orbitals.39,66–68 Empty d orbitals would accept lone-pair electrons of N2 to strength its adsorption, while electrons in occupied d orbitals can be back donated to the antibonding orbital of N2 to weaken the NN triple bond (Fig. 2a). The sp2 hybridized B atom has a similar orbital distribution, including one empty sp2 orbital and a single-electron occupied p orbital,69,70 holding great potential as an efficient active center for N2 fixation and reduction (Fig. 2c). Thus, the boron was introduced in g-C9N10, labeled as B@g-C9N10 (Fig. 2b). To examine the B atom bonding site on g-C9N10, five possible anchoring sites have been considered as shown in Fig. S6a.† The binding energy of the B atom on g-C9N10 was calculated as Eb = E(B@g-C9N10) − E(g-C9N10) − E(B), where E(B@g-C9N10), E(g-C9N10), and E(B) represent the electronic energies of B@g-C9N10, g-C9N10 and single B atom, respectively. The fully optimized structure of B-decorated g-C9N10 is displayed in Fig. S6b–h.† It is obvious that the boron was tightly bonded on site 1, site 2 and site 3. However, boron on site 4 and site 5 would immigrate and finally bind between the heptazine and triazine units simultaneously after geometry optimization. These two bonding patterns are actually in accordance with that on site 1. According to binding energies summarized in Table S2,† it can be found that the binding energy on site 1 is the largest (−5.89 eV), indicating that the B atom prefers to bind between C3N3 and C6N7 simultaneously by two B–N bonds with corresponding bond lengths of 1.45 and 1.50 Å, leaving an empty sp2 orbital (Fig. S7a†) and a half-filled p orbital (Fig. S7b†). After the decoration of B atom on g-C9N10, B@g-C9N10 remains in a planar configuration.

(d) Energy and temperature variation against the AIMD simulation time of B@g-C9N10. The AIMD runs under 1000 K for 10 ps with a time step of 1 fs. The red, blue, and green balls represent the carbon, nitrogen, and boron atoms, respectively. 
For a single-atom catalyst (SAC), the diffusion and aggregation of active atom is a common and tough problem, which reduces the catalytic performance and structural stability. For B@g-C9N10, the B atom was strongly anchored on g-C9N10 with a high bonding energy of −5.89 eV, which is more negative than that of transition metal on g-C2N (see Table S3†), denoting a stronger bonding interaction between the B atom and the g-C9N10 substrate than that of TM on g-C2N.71 Thus, the binding strength of B on g-C9N10 is strong enough to prevent the B atom from aggregation, suggesting the high stability of the anchored B on g-C9N10. Furthermore, the kinetic diffusion of the B atom on g-C9N10 was investigated. As can be found in Fig. S8,† the transfer barrier of the B atom from site 1 to adjacent site 2 is 2.47 eV, which is high enough to prohibit B atom diffusion. Thus, the diffusion and aggression of the B atom on g-C9N10 is unlikely to occur. Therefore, the B active site would remain on the anchoring site during the long-term catalysis reaction, which is a prerequisite for efficient catalysts.
Furthermore, AIMD simulation was performed to investigate the thermal stability of B@g-C9N10. As shown in Fig. 2d, the energy and temperature oscillate within a small range and no severe structure distortion and damage were observed even after 10 ps at 1000 K, demonstrating its high thermal stability. Therefore, g-C9N10 can serve as a promising anchoring substrate for the B atom and B@g-C9N10 holds great potential to be synthesized due to its high thermal stability.
NRR pathway
In order to evaluate the NRR catalytic performance of B@g-C9N10, the thermodynamic driving force has been examined since a low limiting potential is the prerequisite of efficient photo-drive NRR. Generally, NRR process can follow four possible pathways (Fig. 3a), including distal, alternating, enzymatic and consecutive pathway. For N2 adsorbed with end-on configuration, its reduction can go along two different pathways, distal and alternating. For the distal pathway, protonation of N2 preferentially occurs on the terminal N atom before yielding first NH3, and then on the adsorbed N atom to generate second NH3. For the alternating pathway, on the contrary, the protonation occurs on two N atoms in turns. Regarding the N2 with the side-on pattern, NRR would follow the enzymatic pathway or consecutive pathway. For the enzymatic pathway, the electron pairs attack two N atoms alternatingly before the release of first NH3 at the fifth hydrogenation step (Fig. 3a). With respect to the consecutive pathway, the hydrogenation would occur at one N atom consecutively to form first NH3 at the third protonation step and then on the remaining N atom to produce second ammonia.
 Fig. 3  (a) Schematic diagram of four pathways for N2 reduction to NH3 on B@g-C9N10. Free energy profiles of N2 reduction along (b) distal, (c) alternating, (d) enzymatic and (e) consecutive pathway, respectively. 
Free energy profiles for NRRs along these four pathways are shown in Fig. 3b–f, and the respective configurations of all intermediates are presented in Fig. S9–S12.† Technically, strong chemical adsorption of N2 is a prerequisite for the NRR. According to the free energy profile, the corresponding free energies of the N2 adsorption process (ΔG(*N2)) through end-on and side-on patterns are −0.95 and −0.24 eV, respectively. The negative values of ΔG(*N2) indicate that the adsorption of N2 is an exothermic and spontaneous process. Due to the strong interaction between N2 and B@g-C9N10, the first hydrogenation of adsorbed N2 is quite easy with a low energy injection of 0.34 and 0.07 eV for end-on and side-on configurations, respectively. For the subsequent hydrogenation of N2 along the distal pathway, both the formation of first NH3 (*N–NH2 + H+ + e− → *N–NH3) and second NH3 (*NH2 + H+ + e− → *NH3) are endothermic, while the remaining elementary steps are exothermic. Moreover, the Gibbs free energy for the production of second NH3 is 0.38 eV, much higher than that of the first formation of NH3 (0.19 eV). Thus, the formation of second NH3 is the potential determining step (PDS), demanding an energy injection of 0.38 eV. Finally, NH3 will be released from the B@g-C9N10 surface after overcoming a free energy difference of 3.0 eV.
Since the last step is a simple NH3 desorption process without hydrogenation involved, the overpotential is free from the final step. To recover the catalyst, NH3 should be released immediately from the active site at an applied negative potential under experimental conditions. Weakening the bonding strength between NH3 and the catalyst plays a vital role in the desorption of NH3. According to previous studies, the NH3 adsorption strength is weakened by a negatively charged surface in the experimental environment since the bonding between NH3 and B site is ascribed to the donating of the lone-pair electrons from NH3 to the empty p orbital of B.67 Moreover, the dissolution of NH3 in water is exothermic, which stabilizes NH3 in water and promotes its desorption from the catalyst surface. Furthermore, extensive research has recently demonstrated that the NRR catalyst with high theoretical energy consumption for the removal of NH3 still holds high possibility to be an efficient NRR catalyst in experiments.63,70,72–74
For NRR along alternating and enzymatic pathways, interestingly, some common phenomena can be observed. First, the initial hydrogenation of N2 and the production of second NH3 are endothermic, while other elementary steps are exothermic. Moreover, the Gibbs free energy of hydrogenation of N2 (ΔGNNH) is lower than that of formation of second NH3 (ΔGNH3). In particular, the corresponding ΔGNNH values along the alternative and enzymatic pathway are 0.34 and 0.07 eV, lower than the ΔGNH3 value of 0.38 eV, indicating that the formation of second NH3 is the PDS for the NRR along both the alternative and enzymatic pathways. When the NRR follows a consecutive pathway, the three steps, including the first and second protonation as well as the formation of the second ammonia, are endothermic with an energy consumption of 0.07, 0.07 and 0.38 eV, respectively. Therefore, the formation of second NH3 is the common PDS for NRRs on B@g-C9N10 among all possible pathways, which requires an energy consumption of 0.38 eV.
Based on the free energy profile of these four pathways, the NRR overpotential on B@g-C9N10 was examined. The lower overpotential denotes higher catalytic performance. On the basis of the CHE model,58,59 the overpotential can be determined by the function: η = Ueq − Ulim(2)where Ueq is the equilibrium potential of the NRR, which is −0.16 V for N2 reduction to NH3. Ulim is the applied potential required to eliminate the energy difference of the rate determining step (ΔGmax), which is defined as Ulim = −ΔGmax/e. According to the above discussion, the NRR along four pathways shares a common limiting potential of −0.38 eV. Thus, the overpotential of NRR on B@g-C9N10 is 0.22 V. Therefore, the NRR can go through all four pathways with the same overpotential (0.22 V), which is lower than that of B@g-C2N (0.29 V)75 and Re (111) surface (0.50 V),76,77 demonstrating that B@g-C9N10 is a promising metal-free NRR catalyst with low energy cost.
N2 fixation and activation mechanism on B@g-C9N10
In order to reveal the N2 fixation and activation mechanism, charge density difference between N2 and B@g-C9N10 for both end-on and side-on adsorption configurations are investigated, and the results are shown in Fig. S13.† According to the charge density difference result, substantial electrons accumulating and depletion occurs simultaneously on both B and N atoms, indicating a two-way charge transfer between B and N2. This phenomenon is consistent with the electron “acceptance and donation” process that the empty sp2 orbital of anchored B atom would accept the lone-pair electrons from N2, while electrons in the half-filled p orbital can be back donated to the anti-bonding orbital of N2.
To further verify the N2 activation mechanism, the projected density of state (PDOS) before and after N2 adsorption was examined. The electron configuration of gas-phase N2 is 2σg2σu1πu3σg1πg (Fig. S14a and b†), in which the occupied molecular orbitals are 2σg2σu1πu3σg, while the unoccupied orbital is 1πg. Compared to free N2 (Fig. S15a†), a significant peak hybridization around −7.5 eV was observed between the 3σg of N2 and p orbital of B after N2 adsorption on B@g-C9N10 (see Fig. S15b and c†), indicating that the lone-pair electrons on the 3σg orbital of nitrogen occupied the empty p orbital of the B atom.78 Meanwhile, the 1πg orbital of nitrogen splits into three obvious peaks and down-shifts to the Fermi level, one of these even moves below the Fermi level (Fig. S15b and c†). These results confirmed the “back-donation” mechanism that the electrons from B atom occupied the 1πg antibonding orbital of N2. As a result, N2 on B@g-C9N10 was fixed and activated with bond lengths elongating from 1.11 Å to 1.14 Å for end-on and 1.21 Å for side-on configuration, respectively. Thus, the electron “acceptance–donation” process plays a vital role in N2 fixation and activation on B@g-C9N10.
Atomic charge variations of all intermediates along four pathways are also investigated. Each intermediate is divided into three moieties as illustrated in Fig. 4a. Moiety-1 is the g-C9N10 substrate, moiety-2 represents the BN2 unit made up of boron and two surrounding N atoms, and moiety-3 denotes adsorbed NxHy. The charge variation is defined as the difference between the total electron number of the moiety in intermediates and in atomic states, where the positive value denotes obtaining electrons, while the negative value represents donating electrons. Charge variations of three moieties are plotted in Fig. 4b–f, where step 0 represents the charge variation after N2 adsorption. A similar tendency of charge variation along the four pathways was observed. In particular, the BN2 unit (moiety-2) gains electrons and remains roughly unchanged through the NRR (0.42–0.36 and 0.38–0.36 for end-on and side-on configurations, respectively). Meanwhile, the electrons donated from the g-C9N10 substrate go through the BN2 unit and finally transfer to the adsorbate (NxHy). For instance, for the fifth intermediate along the enzymatic pathway, the BN2 unit gains 0.39e− and transfers 0.68e− from the g-C9N10 substrate to the adsorbed NH2. Moreover, the charge distribution of B in intermediates along four pathways was listed in Table S4† to further gain insights of the active site. It is obvious that the B active site remains positively charged throughout, strengthening its adsorption with NxHy. Therefore, during the NRR process, g-C9N10 serves as an electron donor; the BN2 unit is the active site and electron transmitter to transfer electrons from g-C9N10 substrate to adsorbates (NxHy) while adsorbate species accumulate electrons becoming negatively charged, which facilitates further hydrogenation.

Photocatalytic NRRs
In principle, the band edge of a photocatalyst should be aligned with the potentials of redox half-reactions.79 The external potential, provided by the photo-generated carrier, is the driving force of reaction and its magnitude determines if the reaction can proceed spontaneously under light irradiation.80 The external potential for NRR/HER (Ue), is defined as the difference between hydrogen reduction potential (H+/H2) and electron acceptor states. As shown in Fig. 5a, the external potential is −0.72 V for B@g-C9N10, which is more negative than the theoretical reduction potential of NRR (−0.16 V vs. NHE). In addition, the high Ue ensures efficient electron–hole charge separation, which indicates that the photo-generated electrons prefer to be involved in NRR rather than recombination, contributing to high light utilization efficiency. Remarkably, upon the external potential provided by photo-generated electrons, all elementary steps along the four pathways of NRR are exothermic, denoting the spontaneous reduction of N2 on B@g-C9N10 under light irradiation (Fig. 5c).

(b) The corresponding absorption spectra of g-C9N10 and B@g-C9N10. (c) Free energy profile of NRR on B@g-C9N10 at photo-generated external potential. 
It is well known that high photoconversion efficiency plays a vital role for the NRR performance of a photocatalyst.19,81 The light absorbance on g-C9N10 and B@g-C9N10 is examined and shown in Fig. 5b. It was found that g-C9N10 merely exhibits marginal absorption of invisible light, which may be ascribed to its relatively large band gap of 2.65 eV. Interestingly, the light absorption was enhanced with B atom doping, as displayed in Fig. 5b. Two main absorbance peaks remain in the UV region, while an absorption peak emerges around 500 nm in the visible field. Moreover, the light absorption was further extended to the IR region, indicating an extensive light harvesting ability of B@g-C9N10. The enhanced light absorption of B@g-C9N10 can be ascribed to its low band gap, decreasing from 2.65 eV to 0.62 eV with B atom decoration. Thus, B@g-C9N10 would exhibit higher photoconversion efficiency than g-C9N10, which guarantees more efficient generation of photo-excited electrons under light irradiation.
However, broad light-absorption does not mean high photocatalytic performance since the fast and efficient charge transfer from the catalyst to adsorbed N2 plays an essential role in the photocatalysis reaction. Generally, the charge transfer process would be impeded by the introduced dopant, resulting in a poor photocatalytic performance. Interestingly, the experimental research for B-doped g-C3N4 proves that its photo-induced electrons can easily jump from the valence state to the impurity state or from the impurity state to the conduction state.82,83 Moreover, based on theoretical calculation, g-CN with decoration of the B atom exhibits a lower excitation binding energy and a smaller effective mass, demonstrating a faster charge carrier mobility after B decoration.45
In order to further investigate the electron transfer mechanism between N2 and B@g-C9N10, the projected band structures of N2 adsorbed B@g-C9N10 were investigated, as shown in Fig. S16.† Owning to strong interaction between N2 and B@g-C9N10, significant hybridization emerges in the band gap, reducing the electron excitation energy from the valance band to the conduction band to 0.1 eV. In addition, interestingly, it can be found that the N2 states mainly lies in lowest conduction band for side-on configuration, indicating that N2 states is the most energy favorable for excited electron to fill. Thus, the photo-generated electrons from B@g-C9N10 will be directly transferred to the in-gap N2 state to photoactivate N2 in the side-on configuration with lower energy consumption.
Selectivity of NRR
Practically, NRR catalysts with high selectivity are still required since the catalysts active for the NRR are also highly active for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). An optimal HER catalyst has near zero free energy ΔG(H). First, in order to evaluate the HER performance of B@g-C9N10, seven possible active sites were investigated, labeled as N1, N2, N3, C1, C2, C3 and B in Fig. S17a.† According to the Gibbs energy profile summarized in Fig. S17b,† it can be found that the optimal HER site is C3 with an overpotential of 0.34 V, denoting poor HER performance on B@g-C9N10. In addition, vanadium-decorated pyridinic N-doped graphene sheet (V@G-N4) and stepped Ru (0001) surface were taken as comparison due to its outstanding performance, as shown in Fig. 6.84,85 Compared with (V@G-N4) and Ru (0001), the HER on B@g-C9N10 was significantly hindered as a result of stronger interaction between H and B sites. Furthermore, we examined the difference in the limiting potential of the NRR and HER (UL(NRR) − UL(HER)) labeled as δG. It should be noted that a catalyst with a δG value positive greater than −0.5 eV denotes its high selectivity of the NRR.84 Notably, with a δG of 1.90 eV, B@g-C9N10 exhibits excellent NRR selectivity, while the HER is fully suppressed.

Synergistic effects of double active sites
According to recent research, the synergistic effect of double active sites may enhance the activation and reduction of inert N2.71,75 Thus, double B-decorated g-C9N10 (DB@g-C9N10) was constructed by decorating B atoms at two adjacent anchoring sites, as shown in Fig. S18a.† The AIMD simulation was further applied to evaluate the thermal stability of DB@g-C9N10, as shown in Fig. S18c.† One can find that DB@g-C9N10 almost maintains the planar configuration without any bond breaking after 10 ps at 300 K, indicating its high thermal stability.
N2 is then adsorbed on DB@g-C9N10 with the configuration similar to the side-on pattern on B@g-C9N10, displayed in Fig. S18b.† It can be found that the adsorbed N2 is in-plane in the pore with ΔG(*N2) of −2.90 eV (Fig. S19a†), indicating extremely easy adsorption of N2 on DB@g-C9N10. The charge density difference and PDOS are further examined to investigate the activation mechanism of N2 on DB@g-C9N10. With respect to the charge density difference result in Fig. S20a,† electron acceptance and donation, the same as N2 on B@g-C9N10, can be observed that charge accumulation and depletion simultaneously occurred on two B atoms and two N atoms, denoting a two-way electron transfer “acceptance–donation” process. In addition, according to the PDOS results, in Fig. S20b,† it is interesting to find out that an overall orbital hybridization occurred between orbitals of B and N atom. In particular, the orbital hybridization between 2σu, 1πu, and 3σg orbitals of N2 and the p orbitals of B atom can be observed between −10 eV and −5 eV. Moreover, its 3σg orbital significantly shifts towards the Fermi level and even formed a hybridization peak below the Fermi level around −1 eV, indicating that substantial electrons fill into the antibonding orbital of N2 to weaken the NN triple bond. As a result, the NN bond length was elongated from 1.11 Å to 1.25 Å, longer than that of N2 on B@g-C9N10 with side-on (1.21 Å) pattern, demonstrating a stronger activation of N2 on DB@g-C9N10.
To further illustrate the electron transfer between N2 and DB@g-C9N10, the Bader charge analysis was carried out. Fig. S20a† shows that adsorbed N2 was negatively charged and gained 1.12e− from the DB@g-C9N10 substrate, which is much more negative than that of N2 on B@g-C9N10 (0.61e−), well consistent with the PDOS results. Moreover, the negative charged N2 can facilitate the further hydrogenation. As shown in Fig. S19b,† the Gibbs free energy of first protonation of N2 was −1.30 eV, indicating that the first hydrogenation is an exothermal and spontaneous process. These results demonstrate that g-C9N10 is a promising photocatalyst platform with the capability to provide multiple types of decoration and further modulate the photocatalysis performance.
Conclusions
By means of DFT calculations, we have rationally designed a new graphitic carbon nitride, g-C9N10, based on a self-doping strategy. g-C9N10 exhibits higher electron conductivity and extended light absorption range than that of g-C3N4, which is a prerequisite for the high photoactivity of a photocatalyst. In addition, g-C9N10 serves as a promising platform for designing high-efficiency catalysts since abundant sp2 bonded N atoms along the pore edge are perfect anchoring sites for the active center. The boron-doped g-C9N10 (B@g-C9N10) is a metal-free single-atom photocatalyst, which exhibits excellent NRR performance with an overpotential of 0.22 V, while the HER on B@g-C9N10 is efficiently suppressed, indicating its high NRR activity and selectivity against HERs. The electron “acceptance–donation” process plays a vital role in N2 fixation and activation on B@g-C9N10. Amazingly, the photo-induced external potential is adequate to drive the NRR on B@g-C9N10, indicating that B@g-C9N10 is a promising visible/infrared light-driven photocatalyst for NRRs. Meanwhile, double-boron-decorated g-C9N10 (DB@g-C9N10) demonstrates a stronger activation of N2 ascribed to overall orbital hybridization between the p orbital of B and N atoms, denoting the “acceptance–donation” process. Our findings not only proposed a new way to rationally design photocatalysts with high photoactivities, but also demonstrated that g-C9N10 is a promising photocatalyst platform, which is expected to motivate more experimental research efforts to explore.
