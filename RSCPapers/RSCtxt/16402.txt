    , Accepted 27th February 2016First published on 1st March 2016AbstractHierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes, constructed by nanosheets with a thickness of two unit cells (1.2 nm), have been fabricated with Cu(OH)2 nanorod arrays as self-sacrificial templates at room temperature, with a high surface area of 72.3 m2 g−1. The unique structure of the Cu2−XSe nanotubes leads to high electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of polysulfides, given their enlarged active surface area, rapid transportation of electrons and mass. As a result, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) with the obtained Cu2−XSe nanotubes as the counter electrode material exhibit long-term stability and a high power conversion efficiency of 5.14% (1 sun irradiation simulation), better than those of the commonly-used Cu2S/brass (3.38%) and reference Pt (1.78%) electrodes.
1. Introduction
Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have aroused great interest because of their distinct qualities,1–6 such as the multiple exciton effect, high molar extinction coefficients, and so on. However, the energy conversion efficiencies of QDSSCs are still far from their theoretical values. As an integral part of QDSSCs, the counter electrode (CE) plays a crucial role in reducing polysulfide electrolytes (S2−/Sn2−), collecting and transporting electrons from the external circuit. Generally, Pt is used as a standard CE for sensitized solar cells because of the effective interface between the conductive transparent oxide and the Pt. However, the chemisorption of sulfur electrolyte usually leads to the poisoning of Pt CEs and further diminishes the performance of QDSSCs.7 Therefore, much effort has been devoted to exploring alternative non-platinum CE materials, including CoS,8–10 PbS,11,12 CuInS2,13 CuS,14,15 Cu2−XS,16 Cu2−XSe,17,18etc. The conversion efficiencies of QDSSCs with these developed CEs vary from 2.7–6.3%, while most of them are around 3%. Among these non-platinum CE materials, copper selenide-based CEs display the best performance in QDSSCs, because of their highly excellent catalytic activity toward the reduction of polysulfide electrolytes and higher electrical conductivity derived from their lower bandgap.
Recently, copper selenides with different morphologies, including nanoparticles,19 nanosheets,20,21 nanowires22 and nanotubes,18 have been synthesized by various methods such as solvothermal processes,23 SILAR methods,17 wet chemical bath methods,17 sacrificial template methods,18 and so on. For instance, Cui et al.19 fabricated CuXSe (a mixture of Cu3Se2 and Cu2−XSe) nanospheres, with selenium as a precursor, and the conversion efficiency of QDSSCs based on the CuXSe nanospheres was 3.80%, which is much higher than that of Pt (1.06%). Dou et al.16 synthesized hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes with a surface area of 13.34 m2 g−1 by using Cu nanowires as sacrificial templates, and the as-prepared Cu2−XSe CE presented an improved efficiency of 6.3% compared with that of Au (2.68%). However, the studies on Cu2−XSe in QDSSCs are obviously inadequate.17,19
Besides the intrinsic characteristics, the morphology and active surface areas of CE materials also significantly influence the electrocatalytic reduction of polysulfide because of the nature of surface catalytic reactions. Previous work24 indicated that the improvement of the diffusion ability of electrolyte ions on CEs is beneficial to achieve good catalytic performances. Thus, two of the limiting factors on the performance of CE materials are the active surface areas and the structure. For example, the surface areas of reported copper selenides were usually 10–20 m2 g−1,18 which cannot provide enough active sites to reduce polysulfide. Among various morphologies, hierarchical nanotubes have increasingly gained much attention because of their superior performances in higher speeds of electron and mass transfer,25,26 benefiting from their hollow tube structures and hierarchical structures. Hence, hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes may be competitive materials for efficient CEs.26–29 However, there have rarely been reports on the fabrication of hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes with high surface area as CEs for QDSSCs.
In the present study, hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes with high surface area (72.3 m2 g−1), composed of ultra-thin nanosheets, have been successfully fabricated via a facile sacrificial template process at room temperature. Furthermore, a CE of the Cu2−XSe nanotubes yields a largely improved power conversion efficiency of 5.14% under 1 sun illumination, superior to the commonly-used Cu2S/brass (3.38%) and Pt (1.78%).
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes composed of nanosheets with the thickness of two unit cells
Copper foil (4.0 cm2) was pre-cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in abstergent, acetone, ethanol and deionized water for 10 min, respectively. Cu(OH)2 nanorod arrays were then synthesized by a modified method from a previous report.30 The copper foil was immersed in a mixed solution containing NaOH solution (10 M, 8.0 mL), (NH4)2S2O8 solution (1.0 M, 4 mL), ammonia solution (25%, 4 mL) and 40.0 mL of distilled water for 45 min at room temperature, and then rinsed with deionized water and absolute ethanol. 0.01 M Se2− precursor was prepared by mixing NaOH (5 mM), Se (0.01 M) and NaBH4 (0.05 M) together. To fabricate core/shell Cu(OH)2/Cu2−XSe arrays, the Cu(OH)2 arrays on the copper foil were immersed in the 0.01 M Se2− precursor at room temperature for 30 min. Hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes, constructed by nanosheets with the thickness of two unit cells, were obtained by immersing the as-prepared core/shell Cu(OH)2/Cu2−XSe arrays in a 14.4% ammonia solution for 8 h to etch the Cu(OH)2 core. The obtained product was washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol, and dried at ambient temperature under vacuum. The obtained sample was named Cu2−XSe-1. By controlling the concentration of the Se2− precursor solution, Cu2−XSe products with different specific surface areas were obtained. The samples Cu2−XSe-2 and Cu2−XSe-3 were synthesized using 0.005 and 0.02 M Se2− solutions, respectively.
2.2 Preparation of Cu2−XSe, Cu2S/brass and Pt counter electrodes
Cu2−XSe counter electrodes were fabricated on FTO by using a doctor-blade method. The slurry, including 80 wt% ground Cu2−XSe obtained from the copper foil substrates, 10 wt% acetylene black and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride with an addition of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as the solvent, was pasted on the thoroughly cleaned and drilled FTO substrates to form active films of area 0.3 cm2. Subsequently, the as-prepared CEs were dried at ambient temperature under vacuum.
Cu2S/brass CEs were fabricated by a commonly used method according to previous work.31 Pt CEs were prepared according to the reported method in ref. 32. H2PtCl6 (50 μL, 10 mmol L−1) in absolute ethanol was spin-coated on FTO glass, followed by heat-treatment at 400 °C for 30 minutes to form Pt films.
2.3 Preparation of photoelectrodes
FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) glass covered with 0.16 cm−2 areas of TiO2 (the thicknesses of the transparent layer and the scattering layer were 8 μm and 4 μm, respectively) was bought from Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co., Ltd. A successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method was used to fabricate CdS/CdSe QDs co-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes.24
2.4 Preparation of sandwich-style QDSSC devices
The as-prepared CEs were packaged together with the co-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes in sandwich structures by using a Surlyn hot-melt sealed film as the spacer (50 μm thick). The space between the electrodes was filled by an electrolyte solution of 2 M Na2S, 2 M S and 0.4 M KCl through the hole in the electrodes by a capillary effect.
2.5 Materials characterization
The phases of the as-prepared samples were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-6000) with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scanning rate of 6° min−1 (2θ from 20° to 80°); the X-ray tube voltage and current were set at 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was carried out on a FEI Sirion 200 scanning electron microscope. The morphology of the samples was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; FEI Nova NanoSEM NPE 218, 5 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM 100CX and JEOL 2010). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of samples were analysed by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K (Micromeritics ASAP 2020 nitrogen adsorption apparatus, USA). All electrochemical measurements were carried out on a ZAHNER electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER ZENNIUM CIMPS-2, Germany). The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using the electrochemical workstation under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) using an Oriel Solar Simulator (450 W, model 94023A, Newport). The light intensity was determined by a reference Si solar cell (Oriel-91150). The active area of the QDSSCs was about 0.16 cm2, and a black mask was placed over the QDSSCs to define the active area during testing.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted at 0 V bias potential and 10 mV AC amplitude under a frequency range of 10 mHz to 100 kHz. Tafel polarization curves were characterized at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and morphology of the hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes

Scheme 1 shows the fabrication process of the hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes. Firstly, Cu(OH)2 nanorod arrays (step I) and Se2− precursors were fabricated following our previous work:34,35 Cu + 4OH− + (NH4)2S2O8 → Cu(OH)2 + 2SO42− + 2NH3↑ + 2H2O;(1) Se + BH4− → Se2− + BH3 + H+.(2)
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the synthesis and morphological evolution of the hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes. 
Since the solubility of copper selenide (Ksp = 10−61) is much lower than that of Cu(OH)2 (Ksp = 10−20) in alkaline aqueous solution,33 a continuous dissolution–reduction–precipitation process will happen once Cu(OH)2 nanorod templates are immersed into Se2− precursor. Most of the released Cu2+ from Cu(OH)2 nanorods during the dissolution process will immediately be reduced to Cu+ by excess BH4− ions in the reaction solution (3), and then co-precipitated with unreduced Cu2+ by Se2− to form Cu2−XSe (4). Due to the low solubility of copper selenide (Ksp = 10−61), the reaction will be quick enough to transform Cu(OH)2in situ into Cu2−XSe nuclei, which will further grow into Cu2−XSe nanosheets because of the limited growth along the 〈100〉 direction of cubic Cu2−XSe, resulting in hierarchical Cu(OH)2/Cu2−XSe core/shell nanorods (step II). Finally, Cu(OH)2 cores will be removed completely in ammonia solution (5) and hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes composed of nanosheets will form (step III): 2Cu2+ + BH4− + OH− → 2Cu+ + BH3 + H2O;(3) (2 − 2X)Cu+ + XCu2+ + Se2− → Cu2−XSe;(4) Cu(OH)2 + 4NH3H2O → [Cu(NH3)4]2+ + 4H2O + 2OH−.(5)
XRD patterns of the obtained Cu(OH)2 nanorod template on Cu foil, the Cu(OH)2@Cu2−XSe core/shell nanorods and a Cu2−XSe sample are displayed in Fig. 1. All diffraction peaks can be indexed to the reflections of orthorhombic Cu(OH)2 (JCPDF 80-656) and cubic Cu2−XSe (JCPDF 6-680, a = 5.74 Å). The XRD patterns are well in line with the schematic illustration for the synthesis of Cu2−XSe nanotubes. The morphology of the as-prepared Cu(OH)2 nanorod array is shown in Fig. S1,† from which one can see that the Cu(OH)2 array is of nanorods standing on the copper substrate. The average diameter of the Cu(OH)2 nanorods is about 200 nm and the surface morphology is smooth (Fig. S1b†). After the as-prepared Cu(OH)2 nanorod array was immersed in 0.01 M Se2− solution for 30 minutes, and following the dissolution of the Cu(OH)2 cores by dilute ammonia solution, the Cu2−XSe-1 product was obtained (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2b, the average diameter of these 1D hierarchical nanostructures is of 550–600 nm. What's more, it can be easily found that the surfaces of Cu(OH)2/Cu2−XSe or Cu2−XSe are extremely different from that of the Cu(OH)2 nanorods. Actually, the hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanostructures are assembled by very thin nanosheets. These nanosheets are connected compactly to each other to form the hierarchical nanostructure (Fig. 2d) with hollow interiors.

To further investigate the microstructure of the obtained hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes, TEM characterizations were carried out. TEM images at low magnification (Fig. 3a and b) reveal that the hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes are composed of nanosheets, and the different contrast of light and dark indicates the hollow nature of the structure. An enlarged TEM image (Fig. 3c) shows that the thickness of a Cu2−XSe nanosheet is 1.2 nm, which is just twice the size of the cubic Cu2−XSe unit cell (a = 5.74 Å). The nanosheets with the thickness of 2.5 nm are comprised of two stacked nanosheets, in which a small interspace can be observed. The 0.20 nm of interplanar spacing corresponds well with the distance of the (220) planes of Cu2−XSe (Fig. 3c). A SAED pattern of a Cu2−XSe nanosheet (Fig. 3d) also indicates its crystalline nature, with the limited growth along the 〈100〉 direction. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Fig. 4a) reveals that the products are composed of Cu and Se with a molar ratio of 1.28:1. The elemental mapping of typical Cu2−XSe also indicates the uniform distribution of the elements Cu and Se (Fig. 4b–d).

For the face-centered cubic Cu2−XSe, the sequence of surface tension is {111} < {100} < {110} based on the distances between these three facets and the central Wulff's point.36 Thus {110} facets, with the highest surface tension, have the fastest growth rate along its normal direction, which eventually disappears from the final appearance. So the formation of Cu2−XSe nanosheets is derived from its crystal nature because of the limited growth along the 〈100〉 direction. On the other hand, the thickness of Cu2−XSe nanosheets can be controlled by the supply of Cu+/Cu2+ and Se2−, in which the release rate of Cu2+ from Cu(OH)2 is related to the concentration of Se2−. If the concentration of the Se2− precursor is 0.005 M, Cu2−XSe nanosheets with thicknesses of 3.1–3.6 nm are obtained (Fig. 5a and c), which are labeled as Cu2−XSe-2, while Cu2−XSe nanosheets with thicknesses of 4.8–6.3 nm (labeled as Cu2−XSe-3) are obtained if the Se2− precursor is 0.02 M (Fig. 5b and d).

For catalytic applications, the surface active area of electrocatalytic materials plays a key role. N2 adsorption/desorption measurements have shown that the hierarchical Cu2−XSe-2 and Cu2−XSe-3 nanotubes exhibit specific surface areas of 15.7 and 41.7 m2 g−1, respectively. Cu2−XSe-1 has the largest specific surface area, of 72.3 m2 g−1 (Fig. S2†), because of the two-unit-cell-thick nanosheets. By virtue of their large surface area and unique hierarchical hollow structure, hierarchical Cu2−XSe-1 nanotubes may be beneficial to the kinetics of catalytic reduction towards polysulfide electrolytes in QDSSCs.
3.2 Performances of Cu2−XSe CEs and the assembled QDSSCs
To evaluate the electrochemical performances of the as-prepared Cu2−XSe CEs, the density–voltage characteristics of sandwich-like QDSSCs with sulfide/polysulfide as the electrolyte were measured under 1 sun simulated solar irradiation (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). Fig. 6a shows the J–V characteristics of the CdS/CdSe-sensitized solar cells fabricated with different Cu2−XSe CEs, and the corresponding average photovoltaic performance parameters are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

An improved power conversion efficiency (η) of 5.14% was achieved using Cu2−XSe-1 as the CE material, yielding a higher fill factor (FF) of 0.52, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 18.00 mA cm−2, and a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.550 V. The η values for Cu2−XSe-2 and Cu2−XSe-3 are 4.19% and 4.78%, respectively. The improved performance of the Cu2−XSe-1-based QDSSC is derived from its larger surface active area and unique microstructure. To further probe the catalytic activities of different CEs in the reduction of polysulfide, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization measurements were carried out using symmetric cells assembled with two identical electrodes. Fig. 6b shows the impedance characteristics of all the CEs. The equivalent circuit in the inset of Fig. 6b was used to fit the impedance data,15 and the details are summarized in Table 1. The significant negative correlation between the charge transfer resistances and their surface area reveals that CEs with large surface areas can facilitate the charge transfer process and lead to high electrocatalytic activity. The Cu2−XSe-1 CE, with its large surface area, has the smallest charge transfer resistance at the solid–solid (0.65 Ω cm2) and electrolyte–CE interfaces (0.64 Ω cm2), compared with those of the Cu2−XSe-2 (4.76, 3.07 Ω cm2) and Cu2−XSe-3 (1.62, 1.21 Ω cm2) CEs. The order is in good accordance with the difference in the η values.
Cells with the commonly used Cu2S/brass (η = 3.38%, FF = 0.43) and Pt (η = 1.78%, FF = 0.28) CEs were also fabricated for comparison (Fig. 6c and d). Due to serious chemisorption of sulphur species, the Pt CE has the largest series and charge transfer resistance, resulting in the smallest η. Though the Rs and RCT1 of the Cu2S/brass CE are smaller than those of the Cu2−XSe-1 CE, the larger RCT2 (43 times that of Cu2−XSe-1) limits its electrocatalytic reduction and cell performances. These results further confirm that the charge transfer process at electrolyte–CE interfaces is one of the most important factors to determine the catalytic activity of CEs.7 Tafel polarization curves (Fig. S6†) show that the Cu2−XSe-1 CE has the largest diffusion coefficient and exchange current density, which demonstrate that the special hierarchical nanotubes are beneficial for the fast diffusion velocity of the redox couple in the polysulfide electrolyte. Fig. 7 shows the first 50 cycles and 1000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry curves, from which one can see that the Cu2−XSe-1 CE is much more stable than the Cu2S/brass CE because of the continuous sulfide reaction of brass in the polysulfide electrolyte.

Based on the above electrochemical results, the Cu2−XSe-1 CE displayed high photovoltaic and electrocatalytic performances and long term stability in a QDSSC. The high performances are attributed to the inherent characteristics and hierarchical structures of the Cu2−XSe nanotubes. Firstly, Cu2−XSe-1 has high electron conductivity and excellent stability in polysulfide electrolyte. Secondly, the hierarchical Cu2−XSe-1 nanotubes, constructed by ultra-thin nanosheets with a large surface area (72.3 m2 g−1), can provide more active sites to connect with acetylene black and provide more catalytic sites. Thirdly, the well-organized intervals of the hierarchical Cu2−XSe-1 nanotubes can facilitate the diffusion of polysulfide electrolyte; the high surface area and special hollow structures can further provide efficient electron/polysulfide transport channels, which lead to high electrocatalytic activity.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a facile synthetic route has been designed to fabricate hierarchical Cu2−XSe nanotubes, built by two-unit-cell-thick nanosheets at room temperature. The thickness of the nanosheets can be tuned by the concentration of Se2−. The hierarchical nanotubes can provide larger active catalytic surface areas (72.3 m2 g−1), facilitate the diffusion of electrolyte and accelerate the transport of electrons with the hollow channels. Thus, a QDSSC based on the as-prepared Cu2−XSe nanotubes had a high power conversion efficiency of 5.14%, as well as a high fill factor (0.52) and an excellent Jsc (18.00 mA cm−2).
