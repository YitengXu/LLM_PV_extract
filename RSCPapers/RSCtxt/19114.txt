Low-cost, durable, and highly efficient photothermal materials play a crucial role in practical solar water evaporation.

Notably, this banana-derived CBF presents robust mechanical strength that ensures long-term solar water evaporation, surpassing most fragile carbonized biomass materials. Furthermore, the CBF exhibits excellent water treatment performance, including seawater desalination and wastewater purification. This work provides new inspiration to develop simple, cost-effective, and green photothermal materials for applicable solar water treatment.
1. Introduction
Given the serious issues of the energy crisis and freshwater shortage, it is urgent to develop efficient, renewable, and economic strategies to regenerate freshwater from the existing resources.1–3 Seawater desalination and wastewater purification can be useful methods to regenerate fresh and clean water. However, most of the traditional desalination and wastewater treatment technologies are based on fossil fuels or filtration membranes, which require high energy consumption and complex equipment, and are especially not suitable for remote and inconvenient areas.4,5 Solar energy, as the most promising renewable energy source, has been widely explored for diverse applications such as hydrogen generation,6 sterilization,7 solar cells,8 and solar water evaporation.9,10 However, for conventional solar water evaporation, the efficiency is relatively low due to high heat losses and the use of generally expensive optical devices, which hinder its practical application.11 Recently, interfacial solar water evaporation has emerged to attract extensive research interest, which can localize the generated heat at the air–water interface to significantly improve the water evaporation efficiency.12–14
For efficient interfacial solar water evaporation, the following merits of photothermal materials play vital roles: (1) high solar absorption in a wide wavelength and excellent heat generation ability; (2) effective heat management with low heat loss; and (3) porous structure with outstanding hydrophilicity for fluent water supply to evaporation surface. A series of photothermal materials including carbon-based materials,15,16 plasmonic nanoparticles,17,18 semiconductor materials,19,20 and organic photothermal materials21,22 have been explored. Among these, carbon-based materials such as graphite,23 graphenes,24 graphene oxide,25 carbon nanotubes,26,27 and MOF-derived carbon28,29 have been extensively investigated in interfacial solar water evaporation. The intrinsic black color of carbon-based materials enables broadband and high solar absorption. For example, Wang et al.30 reported an MWCNT-based bilayer solar absorber for efficient solar water evaporation, which presents an excellent solar absorption of ∼98%. Zhu et al.31 demonstrated a graphene oxide-based aerogel for solar steam generation, with a solar absorption of ∼92% and an energy conversion efficiency of 83% under 1 sun. However, these carbon materials are generally costly and complex to fabricate, which is not applicable for practical solar water evaporation. Thus, it is imperative to seek efficient and low-cost materials with simple fabrication for solar water evaporation.
Currently, biomass-derived carbon materials have attracted enormous research interest due to their unique natural porous structures, low costs, and renewability. For instance, a series of wood and bamboo-based photothermal materials have been reported for interfacial solar evaporation.32–36 Wood and bamboo are common plants, possessing natural capillary pumping microchannels for water transfer and vapor escape, which can be easily prepared to form carbonaceous materials by facial carbonization. Yang et al.37 proposed a low-cost carbonized loofah sponge for solar water evaporation and purification. The excellent light absorption and hydrophilicity enable an evaporation rate of 1.36 kg m−2 h−1 with an energy conversion efficiency of 83.7%. Liu et al.38 prepared the hierarchical porous carbonized lotus seedpods with high solar absorption of 98–99%, efficient thermal insulation properties, and good water transportation ability. Beyond these, a variety of other biomass materials such as mushroom,39 potato,40 daikon,41 corncob,42 willow catkins,43 sugarcane,44 lime peels,45etc., have been adopted as raw materials for solar absorbers, which have presented an appealing performance in solar water evaporation. However, most biomass-derived carbonaceous materials are fragile, and are not suitable for long-term application. Thus, it is desirable to explore renewable biomass-based materials with enhanced mechanical strength.
Here, in this work, we proposed a 3D carbonaceous foam via the carbonization of bananas which is cheap and highly productive. The biomass banana was first freeze-dried and then subjected to a facile carbonization process. The carbonized banana foam (CBF) possesses a highly interconnected porous structure, ensuring excellent solar absorption and superior hydrophilicity for water transportation. With good thermal management, a high water evaporation rate of 1.51 kg m−2 h−1 can be achieved under 1 sun illumination, delivering an evaporation efficiency of 93.3%. Meanwhile, this CBF exhibits outstanding mechanical strength as well as excellent long-term evaporation performance. By treating the seawater and simulated wastewater, the collected condensed water can fully meet the standards for drinkable water, demonstrating the great potential to deal with the issues of fresh and clean water shortage.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of carbonized banana
Fresh banana was purchased from the local supermarket and obtained by taking the peels off. Fresh banana was first cut into disc slices with a diameter of ∼30 mm and thickness of 8 mm, then treated via a freeze-dried process, followed by a carbonization process at 400 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 in an Ar atmosphere.
2.2 Characterization
SEM images were obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ZEISS Sigma 300, Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a ThermoFisher Nexsa XPS system. The functional groups were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR, Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS5, USA). The Raman spectra were measured by Raman microscopy (ThermoFisher DXR2xi, USA) with an excitation laser source of 532 nm. The absorption spectra were recorded using an ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectrophotometer (UV-Vis-NIR, UV-3600 Plus, Japan), equipped with an integrating sphere. The pore size distribution was obtained using a mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP, MicroActive AutoPore IV 9500) and the specific surface area was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, MicroActive ASAP2460) method based on nitrogen adsorption isotherm measurements at 77 K. The surface hydrophilic property of the sample was evaluated using a contact-angle analyzer (Dataphysics-OCA20, Germany) attached with a high-speed camera. The ion concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Agilent 720ES).
2.3 Evaluation of solar evaporation and purification
All the interfacial solar water evaporation experiments were carried out using a Xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300-T3, CEAULIGHT, China) with an AM 1.5 filter as a solar simulator. The light intensity is adjustable using a power meter (CEL-NP2000-2A, CEAULIGHT, China). For solar evaporation, the CBF with a diameter of ∼24 mm and thickness of 6 mm was supported and surrounded by the expanded polyethylene (EPE) foam (thermal insulator) and placed on the top of a cylindrical container filled with water. The evaporation rate was obtained by measuring the real-time water weight loss using an electronic balance (PTX-FA2105, HUAZHI, China) connected to a computer. The real-time surface temperature was recorded using an IR camera and thermocouples. A homemade setup was designed to evaluate the solar desalination and water purification performance. All the experiments were tested at a room temperature of 25 ± 1 °C and a humidity of about 45%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation and characterization
Banana is massively available in our daily life, which is one of the four most productive fruits around the world.46 In our work, this biomass material was chosen as a raw material to turn into an efficient photothermal material for solar water evaporation by a simple carbonization method. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the peeled fresh banana was first cut and freeze-dried, then carbonized in a tube furnace to obtain the CBF. After carbonization, the whole structure of the freeze-dried banana slice shrinks by ∼20%, but the original shape is well retained without any collapse. The color of the banana slice changes from light yellow to black, which can contribute to enhancing solar light absorption. Notably, as most carbonized lignocellulose materials are fragile, the mechanical strength of the obtained CBF was evaluated, which is essential for long-term solar water evaporation. Fig. 1b shows that the CBF was placed under a standard weight of 500 g (a pressure of ∼1.11 × 104 Pa), which is about 1000 times its weight. And there is no mechanical deformation or breakage observed, indicating the outstanding mechanical strength of the fabricated CBF.

The microstructures of the freeze-dried natural banana before and after carbonization were characterized by SEM images. Compared with the fresh freeze-dried banana (Fig. 2a), the CBF presents a similar microstructure feature (Fig. 2b). Interconnected porous structures with different pores distributed over the inner banana can be observed. The pore size distribution of the CBF mainly ranges from 0.2 μm to 100 μm (Fig. S1, ESI†), and the specific surface area is approximately 8.528 m2 g−1. The naturally porous structure can not only improve light absorption but also endow favorable capillary force for water pumping. The water absorption capability of the CBF was evaluated by measuring the water contact angle. As shown in Fig. 2c, a water droplet was dropped onto the surface of the CBF and completely permeated within merely 0.08 s, indicating its superhydrophilic property. The ultra-fast absorption ability can guarantee fluent water supply from bulk water to evaporating surface for efficient solar water evaporation.

The chemical compositions of the freeze-dried natural banana and the CBF were identified by XPS and Raman spectra. The XPS survey spectra of both samples show two prominent characteristic peaks at the binding energy of 284.7 eV and 532 eV belonging to C 1s and O 1s (Fig. 3a). After carbonization, the ratio of C increases from 69.2% to 81.8%, accompanied by the ratio of O decreasing from 27.9% to 15.8%. Fig. 3b presents the corresponding high-resolution spectra of C 1s peak, which can be deconvoluted into four fitting peaks at 284.5 eV (C–C), 286.3 eV (C–O), 287.8 eV (CO) and 290.0 eV (COOR).47 The intensities of C–O and CO peaks reduce obviously in the CBF, indicating that the deoxidation reaction occurred in the carbonization process.42 In addition, the Raman spectrum of the CBF was also recorded (Fig. S2, ESI†). The spectrum shows the D and G characteristic peaks at 1360 cm−1 and 1582 cm−1 of amorphous and graphite carbon in the CBF, confirming the successful carbonization of natural bananas. The surface functional groups of the freeze-dried natural banana and the CBF were analyzed by FTIR. Due to the natural composition of cellulose, pectin, and hemicelluloses in bananas, functional groups related to these polymers are observed. As displayed in Fig. 3c, vibrations of C–O, CO, and N–H/O–H are observed at 914–1186, 1632, and 2800–3400 cm−1, respectively, which contribute to the hydrophilic nature of the CBF based on these hydrophilic groups.48,49 Notably, the intensities of peaks in the spectral range of 914–1775 cm−1 are much lower in the CBF compared with natural bananas, reflecting the reduced content of C–O and CO groups after carbonization. These results are well consistent with XPS measurements.

Except for excellent hydrophilic properties, high light absorption capability is also an essential prerequisite for efficient solar water evaporation. The light absorption of the freeze-dried natural banana and the CBF was assessed by measuring the transmittance (T) and reflectance (R) using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer in a wavelength range of 250–2500 nm. The absorption is calculated by 1-T–R and shown in Fig. 3d. The natural banana has low absorption over a wavelength range of 500–2000 nm. After carbonization, the light absorption has been dramatically improved, which is higher than 95% in a wavelength range of 300–1350 nm and still above 90% in a wavelength of 1800 nm. The high solar absorption can be ascribed to the formation of carbonaceous materials along with porous structures. Notably, the light absorption of the wet sample aligns better with the practical conditions during solar evaporation, and normally wet sample has better light absorption.50 Thus, the light absorption of the CBF in a wet state was also measured, which is ∼99% over the full solar spectrum range, showing the excellent light absorption ability for practical solar water evaporation.
3.2 Photothermal conversion performance
Thermal management is also of great significance in improving solar water evaporation efficiency. To evaluate the performance of the CBF in solar water evaporation, we designed the evaporator with thermal insulation and a water supply path. As illustrated in Fig. 4a and Fig. S3 (ESI†), the EPE foam with low thermal conductivity (0.025 W m−1 K−1) was tailored at the center, and air-laid paper was introduced as a water transport channel due to the strong capillary force. The CBF was put at the tailored center of the EPE foam, and the constructed evaporator floated on top of a cylindrical container filled with water. Thus, conduction and convective heat loss can be greatly hindered while bulk water can be continuously transferred up. The real-time surface and below-water temperature of the container with pure water and the CBF under simulated light were recorded by thermocouples, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, under 1 sun illumination, with the introduction of the CBF, the surface temperature quickly increases from 22.7 °C to above 30 °C within 1 min. And after 10 min illumination, the temperature tends to be stable at around 35.4 °C. While the temperature of the below bulk water merely increases by about 1 °C (Fig. S4a, ESI†). Whereas the surface temperature for pure water increases slowly with only a slight increase, and the below-water temperature is close to that of the surface (Fig. S4b, ESI†). When the light intensity further increases to 3 sun, a higher surface temperature of ∼53 °C can be achieved, demonstrating the excellent photothermal conversion performance of the CBF. Furthermore, top-view IR images were also recorded to clearly observe the temperature distribution at different time intervals (Fig. 4c). A similar phenomenon was observed, and an apparent hot region was established. In addition, the side-view IR image in Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows a clear differential temperature distribution, indicating good thermal management in our designed system.

3.3 Solar water evaporation performance
The above results on the properties of hydrophilicity, light absorption, and photothermal conversion confirm that the CBF exhibits a high potential for efficient solar water evaporation. The solar water evaporation performance of the CBF was further investigated. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the schematic setup for measuring the solar water evaporation rate. As shown in Fig. 5a, the corresponding time-dependent mass changes of pure water and the CBF under 1 sun illumination were recorded. After 60 min illumination, the mass change of the system increases from 0.35 kg m−2 of pure water to 1.51 kg m−2 of the CBF, demonstrating that the evaporation rate has been significantly enhanced in the presence of the CBF. The evaporation performance under higher light-intensity illumination was measured as well. Under 3 sun illumination, a high evaporation rate of 4.15 kg m−2 h−1 has been achieved, showing the excellent performance of the CBF under high light intensity. The photothermal conversion efficiency (ηth) is defined by the following formula: (1)where ṁ denotes the net mass flux subtracting the dark field evaporation rate (Fig. S7, ESI†), hLV is the total liquid–vapor phase change enthalpy including sensible heat from the initial temperature to equilibrium temperature and latent heat, and Pin is the input power density of solar illumination. Particularly for the calculation of hLV, temperature-dependent latent heat of evaporation is adopted.37,38 The photothermal conversion efficiency of the CBF is calculated to be 93.3% under 1 sun illumination, which is more than 5 times that of pure water (17.7%). The evaporation rate and energy conversion efficiency are superior to most of the previously reported biomass-based works (Table S1, ESI†), suggesting the outstanding solar water evaporation performance of the as-fabricated CBF. When increasing the light intensity to 3 sun, the photothermal conversion efficiency is calculated to be 92.6%, which is slightly decreased due to the increased heat loss under higher solar intensity.51,52

(b) Corresponding solar evaporation rate (left axis) and energy conversion efficiency (right axis). (c) The mass changes over time of the 2D CBF and the 3D CBF. (d) The cyclic performance of the CBF over 15 cycles with 1 h illumination each cycle under 1 sun illumination. 
Since the thickness of the CBF is about 6 mm, it presents a 3D structure (Fig. S8 left, ESI†), which is supposed to contribute to high water evaporation efficiency.53,54 To investigate the effect of 3D structure on the solar water evaporation performance, carbonized banana with a thin thickness of about 1.5 mm was synthesized for comparison. As displayed in Fig. S8 (ESI†) (right), when put onto the tailored EPE foam, only the top surface is exposed as a 2D structure. The corresponding water evaporation rate was measured, as shown in Fig. 5c. The 2D CBF delivers a lower water evaporation rate of 1.24 kg m−2 h−1, which is influenced by the reduced evaporation area compared to the 3D CBF. For 3D structures, the side wall of the CBF also participates in water evaporation and even may absorb energy from the surrounding environment due to the temperature difference, leading to a higher solar water evaporation rate.55,56 However, the thicker thickness, the more raw materials, along with the increased cost. Thus, when constructing a 3D structure, the cost–efficiency relationship should be taken into consideration, which should be investigated in future work. Moreover, durability is also another critical factor for photothermal materials. The solar water evaporation of CBF over 15 cycles with 1 h illumination each cycle under 1 sun was conducted. The results shown in Fig. 5d demonstrate that the evaporation rate is stable with a tiny variation. Furthermore, after two weeks of soaking in water, the structure of the CBF remained well maintained without collapse, and the water evaporation rate shows no noticeable change (Fig. S9, ESI†). These tests confirm that the fabricated CBF possesses satisfactory recyclability and stability for long-term solar water evaporation.
3.4 Evaluation of potential applications
To demonstrate the potential application of the CBF in freshwater regeneration, seawater collected from the East Sea was applied for a solar desalination test via a homemade setup (Fig. S10a, ESI†). Condensed desalted water was collected and characterized. As shown in Fig. 6a, the concentrations of four main cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) in the desalted water are significantly reduced by several orders of magnitude, which are far below the standard for drinkable water defined by the World Health Organization (WHO).57 Besides, the conductivity and potential of hydrogen (pH) of the seawater before and after solar desalination were measured. As displayed in Fig. 6b, the water quality of desalted water is close to DI water. Salt accumulation is also an important consideration for practical applications;58 long-time solar evaporation of seawater was conducted. After continuous solar seawater evaporation under 1 sun illumination for 8 h, no evident salt accumulation was observed on the surface of the CBF (Fig. S10b, ESI†), which should be benefited from the superhydrophilic characteristic of the CBF that provides sufficient water to prevent crystal precipitation.59 In addition, methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB) aqueous solutions (20 mg L−1) were prepared to evaluate the wastewater treatment performance. As presented in Fig. 6c and d, the collected purified water becomes colorless, and the characteristic absorption peaks of both dyes disappear, manifesting that MO and MB have been completely removed from the purified water. Moreover, the solar evaporation rates of experiments based on seawater, MO, and MB solution under 1 sun illumination were measured, which are similar to that of pure water evaporation (Fig. S11, ESI†). The above experimental results confirm that the fabricated CBF possesses high potential for practical solar water treatment to address the issues of drinkable water shortage.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a highly efficient photothermal material for interfacial solar water evaporation has been developed via the carbonization of bananas, a cheap and productive fruit. The as-synthesized CBF, with a natural interconnected porous structure, exhibits strong solar absorption capability and superior hydrophilic properties. Along with good thermal management and 3D structure, a high solar water evaporation rate of 1.51 kg m−2 h−1 with an energy conversion efficiency of 93.3% under 1 sun illumination has been achieved, which is superior to most reported biomass-derived photothermal materials. Notably, different from the common fragile carbonized biomass material, this banana-derived CBF presents outstanding mechanical strength as well as good recyclability and durability. When employed in solar seawater desalination and wastewater purification, the CBF also presents satisfactory water treatment performance. Our results demonstrate that the CBF has promising potential for practical and sustainable water treatment applications to regenerate clean water.
