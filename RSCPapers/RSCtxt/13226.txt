    , Accepted 13th May 2019First published on 3rd June 2019AbstractIn the combined framework of density functional and Boltzmann transport theory, we have systematically studied the electronic structure, mechanical stability and thermoelectric properties of the semiconducting quaternary Heusler alloy, CoFeTiAl. Ab initio simulation predicts a most stable non-magnetic semiconducting phase with a direct band gap of 1.39 eV at the Fermi level using the hybrid (HSE06) exchange–correlation functional. The formation energy (with respect to the elemental ground state) and lattice dynamics simulation suggests that the alloy is thermodynamically as well as mechanically stable. A detailed thermoelectric response (e.g., Seebeck coefficient, electrical and thermal conductivity and power factor) of the alloy has been investigated using Boltzmann transport theory for both electrons and phonons, as implemented in BoltzTraP and ShengBTE codes respectively. From the theoretical findings, we have obtained the upper limit of figure of merit and approaches to unity for both n- and p-type behavior at moderate temperatures. Hence a better thermoelectric response is expected from the present alloy for practical applications.
1 Introduction
Thermoelectric (TE) materials are in the center of worldwide research activities due to their ability to convert waste heat into electricity.1,2 Thermoelectricity is based upon two principles, due to Seebeck and Peltier, which in general, convert residual heat into electricity and vice versa.1 The maximum efficiency (ηmax) of a TE device is calculated by the cold and hot side temperatures (Th and Tc) and the intrinsic figure of merit (ZT) through the following equation,3 (1)
For a given temperature difference, the conversion efficiency depends upon the value of ZT. The higher the value the higher the conversion efficiency. Following eqn (3) (see the next section), the ZT value depends upon transport coefficients such as the Seebeck coefficient (S) and electrical (σ) and thermal (κe, κl) conductivities. Hence, in order to maximize ZT, one needs to minimize the denominator (i.e., κe, κl) and simultaneously maximize the numerator (i.e., σ). However, maximizing ZT is a challenging task due the proportional relationship between σ and κe through the Wiedemann–Franz equation; κe = L·T·σ, where, L represents the Lorentz number.
In earlier days, metals were used for TE devices due to their high electrical conductivity but their reported ZT values were low due to their high thermal conductivity and low Seebeck coefficient. One of the advantages in considering semiconducting materials is that they have a much higher Seebeck coefficient than metals. Most commonly TE materials are based upon bismuth telluride and silicon–germanium alloy since they give ZT values greater than unity at their optimal temperature.4,5 Other materials are lead telluride,6–8 skutterudite9 and chalcogenides.10,11
After the discovery of Heusler alloys (HAs), they have become one of the most researched materials among the material science community, since they pose various magnetic and non-magnetic properties applicable for spintronics, solar cells and thermoelectrics.12 Recently they have become the central focus in TE research due to their semiconducting behavior and tunable band gap properties. Among the various HAs, half-HAs drew more attention due to their decent value of thermopower and figure of merit in a moderate temperature range.13–20 For example, among the half-Heusler family, XNiSn (X = Zr, Ti, Hf)-based compounds are the most reliable for TEs with maximum ZT values lying in the range of 0.7–1.5.13,14,16–20 However, this value is achieved by various kinds of doping (e.g., mixing X with each other or doping Sb with Sn etc.) or nanostructuring21 approaches etc. The maximum ZT obtained for the pristine alloy of ZrNiSn (no doping) remains low (<0.2).18 Our recent work has theoretically predicted a maximum ZT of 0.46 for the pristine bulk crystal of Bi-based half-HA using first principle simulations.22 Recently, another high value of ZT (∼1.42) has been reported for Zr-based half-HA at 973 K with a conversion efficiency of 9%.23
On the other hand, full-HAs have received less attention due to their high thermal conductivity and low value of ZT.24 Indeed, in the past years, full-HAs were explored for TE research, in particular those which are Fe2-based24–28 and also others.29–31 For example, the power factors of bulk Fe2-based alloys24,25 are more (or comparable) than the conventional Bi2Te3 but the ZT value is very low, ∼0.1, due to the high lattice thermal conductivity (27 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K).24 However, a recent nanostructured approach improves the value of ZT up to 0.3 in the Fe2VAl compound.26 Also, the TE properties have been investigated under various conditions in full-HAs (e.g., doping of (Co,Ti) in Fe2VAl27 and intrinsic defects in Co2TiZ(Si,Ge,Sn)31) which resulted in changing the TE properties significantly.
However, the quaternary HAs (see description in the next section) have not been explored much (except very few by Bhat et al.,32,33) for TE research and hence need to be investigated further. As per our knowledge, no theoretical or experimental work has been done on exploring the thermoelectric properties for the present alloy.
This article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the crystal structure of a quaternary CoFeTiAl alloy followed by computational details of the electronic structure and TE simulations. The analysis of stability, electronic structure and TE properties is contained in Section 3. Section 4 is devoted to the summary and conclusions of our work.
2 Crystal structure and computational details
The equiatomic quaternary Heusler alloy, XX′YZ (where, X, X′ and Y are the transition metal and Z belongs to non-magnetic element) consists of four interpenetrating face centered cubic (FCC) sublattices crystallized in the Fmm (#216) space group.12 In general, the transition metals, X, X′ and Y, occupy 4a(0,0,0), 4b(1/2,1/2,1/2) and 4c(1/4,1/4,1/4) whereas, Z occupies the 4d(3/4,3/4,3/4) Wyckoff sites. The occupation of atoms on the lattice sites usually depends upon the electronegativity value.12
Our ab initio simulations are based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)34 with the projector-augmented wave (PAW) basis.35 For the electronic exchange and correlation functional, we have used the generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) under the scheme of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE). For a more reliable estimation of the band gap a sophisticated hybrid functional, Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)36 has been used. The electronic wave functions are expanded in a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy up to 500 eV. The structure is fully relaxed (cell volume, shape and atomic positions) using a conjugate gradient algorithm up to the energy (forces) converging to 10−6 eV per cell. We have performed the ionic relaxation as well as self-consistent-field calculations using both the PBE and the HSE06 functionals. A mixing parameter α of 25% and a screening parameter (controls the short-rangeness of the interaction) ω of 0.2 Å−1 are used for HSE06 simulation. Brillouin zone sampling was done on a Γ-centered k-mesh. For the self-consistent-field calculations, 243k-points and 63k-points were used for the PBE and the HSE06 functionals, respectively. A relatively denser k-mesh of 463 was used for the thermoelectric study.
Mechanical stability of the alloy has been analyzed by performing lattice dynamics simulations. The simulation gives elastic constants by which one can check the mechanical stability of the alloy by satisfying the Born–Huang (BH) criteria.37 Thermodynamic stability has also been investigated by calculating the formation energy (ΔEf). The ΔEf of the alloy with respect to the elemental ground state has been estimated using the following formula, (2)where, E represents the total energy. For the elemental ground state, ferromagnetic hcp structure of Co, ferromagnetic bcc of Fe and fcc for Al have been considered.
The thermoelectric performance of the material is measured by the TE efficiency (eqn (1)), which eventually depends upon a dimensionless quantity known as the figure of merit (ZT), given by the following expression, (3)where, T is the operating temperature (all the other parameters are defined in Section 1). The TE coefficients e.g., S, σ and κe of the alloy were calculated using a semi-classical Boltzmann transport equation under a constant relaxation time (τ) approximation (RTA) and rigid band approximation as implemented in BoltzTraP code.38 The code requires the band structure energy (calculated from first-principles) together with the space group symmetry of the lattice. Thereafter, the electrical conductivity tensor can be obtained by performing the Fourier expansion as,σαβ(i,k) = e2τi,kvα(i,k)vβ(i,k),where, e and τi,k represent the electronic charge and electron relaxation time (comes from the electron–phonon coupling), respectively, and vα(i,k) is the α component of the group velocity for an electron in band index i, given as,  From the previous electrical conductivity matrix, one can calculate the relevant transport tensor, which depends upon the temperature, T, and the chemical potential, μ. Hence, the final expressions for electrical conductivity, group velocity and Seebeck tensors are given as,    and  where, f represents the Fermi–Dirac distribution function.
Currently, the greatest challenge is to compute the relaxation time (τ) using first-principles due to the presence of a complex scattering mechanism (carrier scattering, phonon scattering, boundary scattering, defect scattering etc.).39 This is the reason why constant RTA has been used in most of the ab initio simulations. Lattice thermal conductivity (κl) has been evaluated by solving the Boltzmann transport equation for phonons as implemented in the ShengBTE package.40 In this procedure, 2nd order i.e., harmonic inter atomic force constants (IAFCs), are evaluated using the PHONOPY41 package. The 3rd order i.e., anharmonic IAFCs, are calculated using python scripted, thirdorder.py module of the ShengBTE package. The module is based upon a finite-difference approach and works similar to PHONOPY code. In order to calculate the 3rd order IAFCs, we have generated a 4 × 4 × 4 super cell from the primitive cell (Fig. 1) and considered the inter-atomic interaction up to the fourth nearest neighbor. The macroscopic dielectric tensor and Born effective charges on each atom are evaluated using density functional perturbation theory (implemented in VASP) with the primitive cell (Fig. 1) having a 163k-mesh.

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Stability analysis and electronic structure
The thermodynamic stability of the alloy has been investigated by considering different atomic configurations and various magnetic/non-magnetic phases. In particular, we have taken three non-degenerate atomic configurations namely type-1, type-2 and type-3 as shown in Table 1. Corresponding to each atomic configuration, we have further checked the phase stability by taking non-magnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases into account. The non-magnetic phase of type-1 emerged as the energetically most stable configuration. All the different phases (ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic) in type-1 eventually end up with the non-magnetic phase. Whereas, in type-2 and type-3 configurations, the ferromagnetic phase ends up with the antiferromagnetic in which Ti is antiferromagnetically aligned with the other transition elements.

In the type-1 configuration, Co occupies at 4a, Fe at 4b, Ti at 4c and Al at 4d Wyckoff sites (as shown in Fig. 1). Whereas, in type-2 (type-3), Co occupies at 4d (4b), Fe at 4b (4d), Ti at 4c and Al at 4a Wyckoff sites. The advantage of considering the Heusler alloy is that one can easily predict the magnetic and non-magnetic phases by just counting the total number of valence electrons in the primitive cell, by the so called Slater–Pauling rule42,43viz. mt = (Zt − 24) μB. According to formula, the total number of valence electrons in the present system is 24 which leads mt to be zero, indicating towards non-magnetic semiconducting behavior. The formation energy (ΔEf) of the alloy in its most stable phase is −0.613 eV per atom. The stability checks have been performed using the PBE functional at a relaxed/equilibrium lattice constant (arlp = 5.80 Å) which is also consistent with other literature44.
The total electronic density of states (TDOS) and band structure of the alloy have been analyzed using the HSE06 exchange–correlation functional at a hybrid-relaxed lattice constant (arlp = 5.74 Å) shown in Fig. 2. The band gap (ΔEg) is obtained by calculating the energy difference between the highest occupied valence band and the lowest unoccupied conduction band. In general, the band gap obtained from the conventional PBE is highly underestimated due to the existence of non-physical Coulomb repulsion.45–48 This self Coulomb repulsion reduces after including the exact Hartree–Fock exchange.49 For comparison purposes, the electronic structure obtained by the PBE functional is given in the ESI.†50 Hence, in order to calculate the most accurate band gap, a more sophisticated HSE06 functional36 is taken into account. A direct band gap of 1.39 eV is obtained at the Γ point (solid red plot in the right panel) around the Fermi level (EF) and concludes the semiconducting behavior of the alloy (also supported by ref. 44). The total, as well as the atom- and the orbital-projected, density of states are shown in Fig. 2. The electronic states around EF are mostly contributed to by the transition metals. Specifically, the valence electronic states are mainly due to the Co and Fe atoms whereas, the conduction states are contributed to by all the transition elements. The states arising from the d-orbital electrons are mostly dominated over the s and p-orbital states. In the half-metallic quaternary HAs, the band gap in the minority spin channel is due the strong hybridization of d-orbitals of transition elements. Within the crystal field theory, d-orbitals of the transition metals (e.g., Co, Fe and Ti) split into t2g (dxy, dyx, dzx) and eg (dz2,dx2–y2) orbitals. In order to discuss the origin of the band gap in the minority spin channel, a schematic representation of possible hybridization in different d-orbitals is shown in Fig. 3. Observing the upper panel of Fig. 3, it is seen that the interacting orbitals (i.e., dz2 and dx2–y2) of Co and Fe atoms form a bonding state eg and anti-bonding state eu. Also, the dxy, dyx and dzx orbitals of Co and Fe form t2g bonding and t1u anti-bonding orbitals. The coefficient which arises before e and t denotes the degeneracy of the corresponding orbitals. Observing the lower panel of Fig. 3, it is seen that the eg orbitals of Co–Fe atoms hybridize with the 3d orbitals(e.g., dz2 and dx2–y2) of the Ti atom to form lower lying lower energy orbitals, 2 × eg, and upper lying (higher energy) anti-bonding orbitals, 2 × eg, that are unoccupied and lie above the Fermi level. The other 3 × t2g orbitals of Co–Fe, hybridize with the dxy, dyx and dzx orbitals of the Ti atom and create six new orbitals, three of which are occupied and bonding whereas the other three are unoccupied and anti-bonding. Finally, the orbitals (i.e., 2 × eu and 3 × t1u) of Co–Fe atoms cannot couple with any d-orbital of the Ti atom. The t1u states are occupied and lie below EF whereas, the eu states are just above EF, forming a minority gap state around the Fermi level. There is a total of 12 states below EF, an extra 3 states coming from the deep lying 3p and 1s orbitals. The d-orbitals (t2g and eg) projected density of states from the transition elements are also shown in Fig. 3 (bottom plot).

3.2 Mechanical stability and phonon dispersion
In order to check the mechanical stability of the alloy, elastic constants (Cij) are calculated. The values are, C11 = 365.20 GPa, C12 = 106.46 GPa and C44 = 120.65 GPa. These values clearly satisfy the BH criteria, (C11 − C12)/2 > 0, (C11 + 2C12)/3 > 0 and C44 > 0, which indicate the alloy to be mechanically stable.
Phonon dispersion plots for the alloy are shown in Fig. 4. The primitive cell contains 4 atoms, hence there are 12 vibrational modes as shown in Fig. 4 (left panel). Fig. 4 depicts that three are acoustic, whereas the remaining nine modes are optical. We do not find any imaginary/anomaly frequencies along the symmetry points (e.g. W, L, Γ and X) in the first Brillouin zone which indicates the alloy to be mechanically stable. Some of the optical/acoustic modes are degenerate at the Γ point whereas some are well separated along L to W or X to W symmetry points. Due to the comparable masses of the transition elements (Co, Fe and Ti) and significant difference with Al atom, there is a well separated band gap existing among the phonon modes. In the phonon density of states (Ph.DOS) plot (right panel), the Ph.DOS (<8 THz) are mainly because of the heavier transition metals (almost equally contributed by Co, Fe and Ti atoms) whereas, the lighter atom (Al) vibrates with a higher frequency (>10 THz). The optical and acoustic modes are overlapped along L to W and X to W symmetry points because of the comparable masses of transition elements. The mixing of these two (acoustic and optical) modes gives a considerable phonon–phonon scattering, which results in low thermal conductivity of the compound.

3.3 Thermoelectric properties
The topology of the electronic band structure and the band gap (ΔEg) play a very significant role in predicting the thermoelectric response of semiconducting compounds. It is generally believed that the flatness of electronic bands (high rise in density of states) leads to a high effective band mass which eventually produces a high Seebeck coefficient.51 However, this also corresponds to the low mobility (μ) since in the parabolic band assumption and in the case of elastic scattering μ(= τe/mI*) is inversely proportional to the transport effective mass, mI*. Furthermore, the scattering time (τ) decreases with the band effective mass when the charge carriers are mainly scattered by the phonons. Low mobility of carriers affects the electrical transport (or conductivity) significantly.
From the band structure plot (Fig. 2), it is seen that the energies of extrema/valley points arising at Γ, X and W of the conduction band are very close, indicating a high degenerate energy level that acts to enhance the electronic transport significantly. Also, the valley points, arising at Γ and X of the valence band are close in energy, causing the hole transport enhancement. Therefore, both the n- and p-type responses of the alloy are expected to be promising for thermoelectric applications.
From Fig. 2, it is clear that the topology of the electronic bands are almost similar in both cases (PBE electronic structure is shown in the ESI†). Hence, in order to calculate the more accurate TE response of the alloy, we rigidly shift the ΔEg obtained from the PBE to match with the ΔEg obtained from the HSE06 functional. This kind of rigid shift is often used to calculate the TE properties of a material. The BoltzTrap code gives the scaled value of electronic conductivity (σ) and electronic thermal conductivity (κe) i.e. σ/τ and κe/τ, hence using eqn (3), one can predict the upper limit of ZT as, (4)where, ZTe(= S2(σ/τ)/(κe/τ)) is defined as the upper limit of ZT.
A detailed TE response (i.e., S, σ/τ, κel/τ, S2σ/τ and ZTe) as a function of chemical potential (μ) has been depicted in Fig. 5. The μ dependent quantities are shown at four different temperatures, 300 K, 500 K, 700 K and 900 K. The plot μ − EF = 0 signifies that EF lies exactly in middle of the band gap concluding to the undoped semiconductor. In n-type doping, the value of μ lies near the conduction band whereas, in case of p-type doping, μ lies near the valence band. Since the transport coefficients (σ, κe and S) are tensor quantity of rank-2 with nine directional components. Also, we have found that the diagonal components have larger contributions than the off-diagonal components. Hence, we have taken the average of the diagonal contributions. It is evident from the lower plot that there are two peaks of Seebeck coefficient (S) obtained near μ = EF. The negative (positive) value signifies the n(p)-type behavior. The peak value of S lies in the −0.50 to 0.75 eV range of μ for both n- and p-type. The maximum value of S for p-type is 2151 μ V K−1 and −2286.2 μ V K−1 for n-type behavior at 300 K. In the range of 0.5 to 1.5(−0.5 to −1.5) eV of μ, σ/τ increases rapidly and has the dominant contribution in the power factor (S2σ/κ vs. μ plot) for both p- and n-types. This corresponds to an optimal carrier concentration (nmax), which is based upon the peak value of the power factor at different temperatures. However, κe/τ (kel/τ vs. μ plot) shows the peaks at a relatively higher concentration than nmax (estimated using the power factor). Each value of μ corresponds to a carrier concentration (n). Due to this, the optimal carrier concentration at which ZT achieves the maximum value is changed (ZTevs. μ plot). As such, the process of considering the optimal value of n is not straightforward. In practice,52 the optimal n corresponds to the maximum power factor whereas, in most cases, the optimal n does not correspond to the maximum ZTe.22 Hence, we have chosen nmax from the ZTe-vs.-μ plot (Fig. 5). It is also evident from Fig. 5 that nmax corresponds to the maximum power factor and ZTe is different (specific values are given in the ESI†50). The optimal carrier concentration is −4.32 × 1018(2.24 × 1018) cm−3 for n(p)-type behavior obtained at 900 K. The maximum power factor (S2σ/τ) for n-type behavior (12.42 × 1011 W K−2 ms−1) is slightly dominated over the p-type (10.0 × 1011 W K−2 ms−1) behavior of the alloy. The maximum power factor is obtained at 900 K for both n- and p-types. At such high temperatures, ke becomes very large due to thermally excited electron–hole pairs but at the same time κl decreases drastically due to a decrease in the mean free path of the highly agitated phonons. Thus at high temperature limit, the intrinsic figure of merit is estimated by ZTe(∼S2/L) (see eqn (4)) where (L = κe/T·σ), which essentially depends upon the Seebeck coefficient. From Fig. 2, the magnitude of total density of states near the Fermi level (conduction and valence band) are almost the same giving rise to nearly the same value of the Seebeck coefficient for both n- and p-type behavior. Indeed, we found a high value of S (mentioned above) for both n- and p-types, due to which ZTe approaches unity. Hence, both n- and p-type behaviors of the present alloy are promising for thermoelectric application.
 Fig. 5  Transport coefficient versus chemical potential (μ) at various constant temperatures (300 K, 500 K, 700 K and 900 K). The Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical conductivity (σ/τ), electronic thermal conductivity (κe/τ) and power factor (S2σ/τ) are measured in μV K−1, 1020(Ω ms)−1, 1016 W (K ms)−1 and 1011 W K−2 ms−1. 
The temperature-dependent (TD) plots for various transport coefficients at optimal n (as given above) are shown in Fig. 6. The absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient i.e., |S| initially increases (for both n- and p-type) up to 400 K due to the extrinsic transport of the majority charge carriers while minority charge carriers start playing a role at higher temperatures. At higher temperatures, the electrons and holes coexist and therefore contribute to S significantly. Hence, the total Seebeck coefficient can be expressed as S = (Snσn + Spσp)/(σn + σp). Also, due to opposite sign of S for both electrons and holes, the total S is usually lower than either of the individual contributions, unless the direct band gap is large enough to minimize the minority carrier contribution. Hence, the total S either for n- or p-type decreases at higher temperatures (>400 K). Thus, it is necessary to adjust the carrier concentration to make the semiconducting alloy show predominant n-type or p-type transport properties. The electrical and electronic thermal conductivities (i.e., σ/τ vs. T and κe/τ vs. T) are increasing with T due to thermally excited charge carriers (Fig. 5 and 6). The values of transport coefficients (e.g., S, σ/τ and κe/τ) at the optimal n are given in Table S1 of the ESI.†50
 Fig. 6  Transport coefficients versus temperatures (T) at a particular carrier concentration (lower panel) for both n-type and p-type channel. The maximum value of figure of merit (ZTe) saturates to 1.0 for both p and n-types. All the other transport coefficients measured in the unit as mentioned in Fig. 5. 

3.3.1 Thermal conductivity and figure of merit. 
The upper limit of ZT (i.e., ZTe) which is independent of relaxation time, has been depicted in Fig. 6. The value of ZTe approaches unity for both n- and p-type behavior in the whole range of T. The obtained value however, excludes the lattice thermal conductivity but it indicates that the alloy is promising for thermoelectric applications at moderate temperatures.
A plot of κlversus T is presented in Fig. 7. Following the plot, it is clear that κl decreases with T, which indicates that the phonon scattering rate is increased due to decrease in the mean free path of thermally excited phonons. In the considered range of T, the maximum(minimum) value of κl is 16.64(3.79) W m−1 K−1 at 200(900) K.
 Fig. 7  Variation of lattice thermal conductivity (κl) with temperature (T). The value of κl is measured in (W m−1 K−1). 
In order to predict the most significant (or closure to the experiment) ZT, the value of lattice thermal conductivity (κl) and the value of electron relaxation time (τ) needs to be included in eqn (3). The estimation of τ from ab initio simulation is challenging due to the various scattering factors. Hence, in general, τ is estimated by comparing the theoretical σ/τ (since the BoltzTraP code gives only the scaled σ i.e., σ/τ) to the experimentally observed value of σ. Unfortunately, due to unavailability of the experimental σ, estimation of τ for the proposed alloy is not possible. However, considering the calculated value of τ from the other Heusler cases,53,54 we have taken two constant values of τ, i.e., 1.21 × 10−13 s.53 and 2.45 × 10−13 s.54 to predict the value of ZT. At 1.21 × 10−13 s, the obtained value of ZT is 0.62(0.50) for n(p)-type behavior at 900 K. However, for 2.45 × 10−13 s, we obtained the highest value of ZT as 0.75(0.66) for n(p)-type behavior at 900 K.

4 Summary and conclusions
Using ab initio density functional and the Boltzmann transport theory, we present a systematic study of the electronic structure, mechanical/thermodynamic stability and the transport properties of a CoFeTiAl Heusler alloy. We propose a semiconducting quaternary Heusler alloy, CoFeTiAl, as a promising candidate for thermoelectric applications at moderate temperatures. The band gap plays a very crucial role in predicting the thermoelectric properties, hence we have used a range-separated hybrid(HSE06) functional in predicting the accurate band gap of the alloy. We have predicted the upper limit of ZT for both n-type and p-type channels. The upper limit of ZT (i.e., ZTe) saturates to unity for both n- and p-type channels for a whole range of temperatures, probably because of the existence of multiple-valleys at various symmetry points in the conduction and the valence bands. It is also observed that not only the band topology, but also the band gap, affects the transport properties very significantly. Hence, the estimation should be very accurate to predict the reliable value of ZT. We have also predicted the corresponding carrier concentration (n). The optimal value for n is −4.32 × 1018 cm−3 and 2.24 × 1018 cm−3 for n- and p-type at 900 K, respectively. The lattice part of thermal conductivity is calculated using a more accurate ShengBTE code based upon Boltzmann transport equation for phonons. The minimum value of κl is 3.79 (W m−1 K−1) obtained at 900 K. After considering the two different values of relaxation time (τ) (1.21 and 2.45 × 10−13 s), we have obtained the highest value of ZT as 0.75(0.66) at a later value of τ for the n(p)-type behavior at 900 K. Reduction in lattice thermal conductivity can further be made by considering various mechanisms e.g., intrinsic defects or external doping which could further enhance the value of ZT.
Hence, we expect our present analysis will pave a new direction to our experimenting colleagues, to carry out the experimental research of the proposed alloy.

 	Fig. 2  The electronic structure of CoFeTiAl alloy using HSE06 (right) exchange functional at relaxed lattice constant (arlp = 5.74 Å). A direct band gap of 1.39 eV is obtained at the Γ point. The total as well as the atom- and orbital projected density of states (Den. of St.) are shown by the middle and right panels, respectively. The Den. of st. are measured in (states per eV per f.u.). Dashed line and TDOS represents Fermi level (EF) and total density of states, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  Schematic representation of hybridization between minority d-orbitals (UP) and orbital-projected density of states (DOWN) of transition elements.	 

 	Fig. 4  Phonon dispersion (left) and the phonon density of states (Ph. DOS) for CoFeTiAl.

 	Fig. 5  Transport coefficient versus chemical potential (μ) at various constant temperatures (300 K, 500 K, 700 K and 900 K). The Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical conductivity (σ/τ), electronic thermal conductivity (κe/τ) and power factor (S2σ/τ) are measured in μV K−1, 1020(Ω ms)−1, 1016 W (K ms)−1 and 1011 W K−2 ms−1.	 

 	Fig. 6  Transport coefficients versus temperatures (T) at a particular carrier concentration (lower panel) for both n-type and p-type channel. The maximum value of figure of merit (ZTe) saturates to 1.0 for both p and n-types. All the other transport coefficients measured in the unit as mentioned in Fig. 5.	 

 	Fig. 7  Variation of lattice thermal conductivity (κl) with temperature (T). The value of κl is measured in (W m−1 K−1).
