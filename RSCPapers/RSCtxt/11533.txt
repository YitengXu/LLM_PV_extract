    , Accepted 9th October 2022First published on 2nd November 2022AbstractUtilization of chlorinated end groups is an efficient strategy for developing small molecule nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with narrow bandgaps. Previous studies on nonfullerene acceptors with chlorinated end groups mainly focus on the modulation of either heterohalogenated or monochlorinated end groups, and the structure–property relationships in a series of isomeric NFAs are poorly understood. In this work, three A–D–A (acceptor–donor–acceptor)-type isomeric NFAs (MQ7-i, MQ7-o, and MQ7-m) are designed and synthesized by using an asymmetric ladder-type heteroheptacene core flanked by two dichlorinated end groups with various chlorine atom positions. Based on grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) results and crystallographic analysis, the relationships between molecular structures, π–π stacking motifs, and charge transport behaviors of the three isomeric acceptors are systematically revealed. Both the twisted conformations and enlarged π–π stacking distances of MQ7-o and MQ7-m undermine their efficient charge transport, leading to the low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for MQ7-o- and MQ7-m-based polymer solar cells. In contrast, MQ7-i shows a significantly higher electron mobility and therefore an enhanced PCE of 16.23%. The improved performance of MQ7-i can be attributed to the more efficient charge transport channels in its 3D stacking network, which comprises the more planar molecular structure with the more favorable π–π interaction and the largest charge transfer integrals (18.5 and 24.8 meV).
1. Introduction
Given the prominent hallmarks of light weight, good flexibility, potential semitransparency, and low-cost solution processibility, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn growing attention over the past two decades.1–10 The molecular design of organic semiconductors is the cornerstone for developing high-performance OSC materials. Since the concept of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) was first proposed by Zhan et al.,11 unparalleled advancements have been witnessed in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs, thanks to the great efforts devoted to molecular design and synthesis of new NFAs, such as side-chain engineering,9,12–19 fused-ring core (D unit) modulation,20–23 and terminal group (A unit) modification.7,8,24–27 Usually, most A–D–A-type NFAs have an electron-rich π-conjugated core (D) with sp3-hybridized carbon atoms.23,28,29 For example, by altering the numbers of fluorine in end groups, Marks et al. developed a series of A–D–A-type NFAs with sp3-hybridized side chains, which exhibited PCEs varying from 8.72% to 11.89%.29 The side chains on the sp3-hybridized carbon atoms always stick out from the π-conjugated backbone which will inevitably enlarge their intermolecular π–π stacking distances and therefore inhibit the efficient charge transport.15,30 To diminish the unfavorable steric hindrance of side chains, the sp2-hybridized nitrogen atoms were introduced to replace the sp3-hybridized carbon atoms in the D unit of NFAs, thereby enhancing their intermolecular interaction, charge transport properties, and photovoltaic performance.31–33 At the same time, some of the A–DAD–A-type NFAs (such as Y6, L8-BO) also showed outstanding PCEs due to their enhanced charge transport properties with sp2-hybridized nitrogen atoms in their electron-deficient cores.3,9
Recently, our group designed and synthesized a number of M-series NFAs based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]bis(4-H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole) (BDTPT) cores with two sets of alkyl side chains located in two neighboring sites (nitrogen and oxygen).34–37 These M-series NFAs show tendencies to adopt a “face-on” orientation when branched alkyl chains (such as 2-butyloctyl) were attached to both the nitrogen and the oxygen atoms.38 By replacing one of the thiophene rings in the BDTPT core with a selenophene ring, we further synthesized an asymmetric A–D–A-type NFA (MQ6), which showed a decreased optical bandgap and improved charge transport owing to the increased quinoidal character of selenophene, the enhanced noncovalent interaction of O–Se, and the strengthened π–π stacking interaction.39,40 For the A–D–A-type NFAs, halogenation (especially fluorination and chlorination) of end groups is recognized as an efficient strategy to tune electron density and noncovalent interaction of NFAs.19,30,41–48 It is known that chlorinated terminal groups can improve the crystallinity and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect of NFAs.49–59 Specifically, the chlorine-containing NFAs can exhibit a red-shifted absorption, enhanced intermolecular noncovalent interaction (Cl–π), and ICT effect than the fluorinated counterparts, which can be ascribed to the unoccupied 3d orbitals and the greater electron affinities of chlorine atoms.53,60 So far, the studies on the chlorination of NFAs have been mainly focused on monochlorination or heterohalogenation of terminal groups,61–66 and the A–D–A-type NFAs with different dichlorinated terminal groups are rarely investigated.
Herein, three novel NFAs (MQ7-i, MQ7-o, and MQ7-m) based on the selenophene-fused asymmetric core with three different dichlorinated IC isomers (IC-2Cl-i, IC-2Cl-o, and IC-2Cl-m) are successfully developed, which allows us to thoroughly investigate the isomeric effects of chlorinated NFAs on their light-harvesting, single-crystal packing, charge transport, and photovoltaic performance. From MQ7-o, to MQ7-m, and to MQ7-i, an increased electron mobility is observed, which agrees with the decreased π–π stacking distance as the corresponding torsion angles decline. MQ7-i has the most planar molecular conformation, the smallest π–π stacking distance, and the strongest electronic couplings among the three acceptors, consequently resulting in the highest electron mobility. In combination with the polymer donor material of PM6 (Fig. S1 in the ESI†), MQ7-i-based OSCs yield a best PCE of 16.23%, which outperforms the MQ7-o-based (15.06%) and the MQ7-m-based (14.54%) counterparts.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Material design and synthesis
The synthetic procedures, specific experimental details, and related data are presented in the ESI (Scheme S1, ESI†). 2-(4,5-Dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2Cl-o) and 2-(4,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2Cl-m) were obtained by Knoevenagel condensation reactions between malononitrile and their corresponding indanediones in 70% and 74% yields, respectively. Notably, 2-(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-2Cl-i) was synthesized in 56% yield without other isomers due to the use of a symmetric precursor (compound 1 in the ESI†). It is worth noting that other isomers of both IC-2Cl-m and IC-2Cl-o were not observed due to the steric hindrance of the chlorine atoms adjacent to the carboxylic group, resulting in decent yields and synthetic convenience of the target end groups. Diffraction quality crystals of the three end groups were successfully obtained, thanks to their high purity, and the corresponding crystal structure data are presented in Table S1.† As depicted in Fig. 1, the intermediate T-BDT-Se-C12-CHO was prepared according to the procedure reported previously.39 Furthermore, MQ7-i, MQ7-o and MQ7-m were obtained via Knoevenagel condensation reactions between the three different terminal groups (IC-2Cl-i, IC-2Cl-o and IC-2Cl-m) and T-BDT-Se-C12-CHO, with yields of 89%, 80%, and 94%, respectively. All these acceptors were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, elemental analysis, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (ESI†). The three acceptor materials show good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, toluene, and chlorobenzene.

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the three NFAs in diluted chloroform solutions (5 × 10−6 M) and in neat films are shown in Fig. 2a and b, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. In diluted solutions, MQ7-m, MQ7-o, and MQ7-i all have strong absorption bands ranging from 700 to 800 nm. The absorption peaks of MQ7-m, MQ7-o and MQ7-i were located at around 773, 764, and 765 nm, respectively. Compared to MQ7-o and MQ7-i, MQ7-m showed more bathochromically shifted absorption, which can be ascribed to the chlorine atoms substituted in the β- and δ-position of the benzene ring of the terminals and the stronger intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. For MQ7-m, MQ7-o and MQ7-i, their maximal molar extinction coefficients (εmax) are 2.60 × 105, 2.76 × 105, and 2.79 × 105 M−1 cm−1, in that order. Compared to the absorption properties in solutions, the absorption maxima of MQ7-m (841 nm), MQ7-o (825 nm), and MQ7-i (837 nm) in annealed pristine films are conspicuously red-shifted owing to the strengthened intermolecular interaction in the solid state. Specifically, MQ7-i has the biggest red-shifted value (72 nm) among the three acceptors (68 nm for MQ7-m and 61 nm for MQ7-o), indicating that the π–π interaction of MQ7-i is slightly stronger than those of MQ7-m and MQ7-o. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) for MQ7-o, MQ7-i, and MQ7-m were 1.36, 1.34, and 1.32 eV, which were estimated from their absorption edges (λonset) at 909, 925, and 936 nm, respectively. Given the complementary absorption strategy of donor and acceptor materials, the wide bandgap polymer of PM6 was chosen as the donor material for fabricating high-performance photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were conducted to investigate the electrochemical properties of MQ7-m, MQ7-o, and MQ7-i. The CV plots and energy-level diagrams are shown in Fig. 2c and d, and detailed electrochemical parameters are listed in Table 1. According to the onsets of oxidation/reduction potentials, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated to be −5.63/−3.97 eV for MQ7-m, −5.61/−3.93 eV for MQ7-o, and −5.63/−3.96 eV for MQ7-i, respectively. The corresponding electrochemical bandgaps of MQ7-m, MQ7-o, and MQ7-i were determined to be 1.66, 1.68, and 1.67 eV, which parallels their optical bandgap trend. Density functional theory (DFT) computation at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-31G(d) level was conducted to investigate the distribution of the LUMO and HOMO of the three NFA materials. As shown in Fig. 3d–i, the calculated HOMO and LUMO were −5.56/−3.55 eV for MQ7-m, −5.54/−3.51 eV for MQ7-o, and −5.58/−3.56 eV for MQ7-i, respectively, which is generally consistent with the energy level trend from the CV measurements. The shallowest LUMO among the three acceptors endows MQ7-o with the broadest electrochemical bandgap of 1.68 eV. Compared to the chlorine in the β-position of the terminals of MQ7-o, the counterparts in the δ-position of MQ7-i have more contribution to the down-shifted energy level and the bathochromically shifted absorption character. Among the three acceptors, MQ7-m presents the most red-shifted absorption due to the resonance effect derived from the chlorine atoms in the β- and δ-positions of the terminals.

2.3. Crystal structures and molecular packing behaviors
Diffraction quality crystals of MQ7-i, MQ7-m, and MQ7-o were successfully obtained and thoroughly investigated to elucidate their structure–property relationships. The crystal growth details are illustrated in the ESI.† As listed in Table S2,† single crystals of the three materials exhibit P space groups. For each single crystal, the conformer with the biggest torsion was chosen as the representative conformation to illustrate the trend of optical properties in solid films. And the thermal ellipsoid drawings (30%) of the representative conformations for MQ7-i, MQ7-o, and MQ7-m are depicted in Fig. 3a–c, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, MQ7-i, MQ7-o, and MQ7-m exhibit a similar wavy and slightly twisted molecular geometry owing to the similar S⋯OC, Se⋯OC interlocking structures. The varied S/Se⋯O interaction distance of MQ7-m, MQ7-i and MQ7-o may be ascribed to the different resonance effects of chlorine in the end groups (Fig. S2, ESI†). For MQ7-m and MQ7-o (both substituted by chlorine at the β-position of end-capping benzene rings), the S/Se⋯O distance shrinks as the positions of chlorine atoms change from the γ-position to the δ-position of the end-capping benzene rings. Compared to MQ7-i (2.660 Å), the decreased S/Se⋯O distance of MQ7-m (2.597 Å) entails a bathochromic absorption, while the increased S/Se⋯O distance of MQ7-o (2.720 Å) leads to a hypsochromic absorption, which is in good accord with the trend in their light-harvesting properties.45,67 Moreover, the additional intramolecular Cl⋯O interaction (3.093 Å) of MQ7-o and MQ7-m may be responsible for the smaller internal reorganization energies (λint) of MQ7-o (137.3 meV) and MQ7-m (133.5 meV) in comparison with MQ7-i (139.6 meV). Furthermore, the D–A torsion angles between the end groups and the fused-ring cores were measured to evaluate the planarity of the three acceptors. Specifically (see Fig. 3a–c and Table 2), the absolute value of D–A torsion angles of MQ7-i ranges from 0.29° to 4.40°, much smaller than those of MQ7-m (3.45° to 8.08°) and MQ7-o (4.92° to 11.87°), indicating that MQ7-i possesses a more planar molecular conformation compared to MQ7-m and MQ7-o, which is a prerequisite for the orderly and efficient packing motifs.

To investigate the molecular packing motifs of the three acceptors, the alkyl chains of the single crystals have been omitted for the sake of clarity. The atoms in the fused-ring cores (D unit) are marked as grey, while the atoms in the end-capping groups (A unit) are highlighted by blue, red, or green, which represent conformational molecules B, R, or G in these single crystals, respectively (Table 2 and Fig. 4d–f). Furthermore, the three-dimensional (3D) interpenetrating networks of the three single crystals all consist of three types of dimers: I, II, and III. Dimers I in MQ7-m and MQ7-i are composed of a pair of “D–A” π–π stacking modes, whereas the π–π interaction is not observed in the counterparts of MQ7-o. For all three acceptors, dimers II contain one type of “A–A” π–π stacking mode, and dimers III involve one type of “D–A” π–π stacking mode with a certain rotational angle (Fig. S3–S5, ESI†). Rotational angles between the long axis of adjacent molecules are presented to evaluate the overlapped degrees of π-orbital in the arene rings.68 The specific parameters and noncovalent interaction distances are summarized and presented in Table 2 and Fig. 4, respectively. For MQ7-o, the two independent molecular conformations (B and R) of single crystal lead to three kinds of dimers (Fig. 4c and f). Only two kinds of them exhibit efficient π–π interaction between neighboring molecules, including the π–π stacking between two terminal groups (dimer II) with a distance of ∼3.36 Å, and the π–π stacking between one terminal group and partially central core of adjacent molecules (dimer III) with a distance of ∼3.54 Å, respectively. On the one hand, the N–H interaction (ca. 2.67 Å) and the N–Cl interaction (ca. 3.15 Å) bridge the conformational molecules B and R by “edge to edge” (Fig. 4c), which enhance the relative electronic couplings.69 On the other hand, these strong noncovalent intermolecular interactions induce a bent geometry of conformational molecule R and further result in weak Cl–π interactions (ca. 3.64 Å) and the absence of “D to A” π–π stacking in dimers I. The unfavorable packing motifs, great torsions, and large π–π distances lead to the comparatively disordered and ramshackle 3D interpenetrating network in the single crystal of MQ7-o. Based on the results of quantum computation (Fig. 5c), a small coupling transfer integral value (5.4 meV) is obtained in dimers I of MQ7-o, which hinders efficient charge transport through the 3D network with crooked quadrangular frameworks (length/width: 22.6 Å/15.7 Å), thereby leading to the lowest carrier mobility for the MQ7-o-based solid films.

(Right) Molecular aggregation diagrams illustrating the relationships between an arbitrary central molecule (in color) and its four near neighbors. Electronic coupling values calculated between LUMOs of adjacent molecules at the DFT-B3LYP/6-31G are relative to the central molecule. 
Likewise, the two independent molecular conformations (B and R) in MQ7-m lead to three types of dimers, forming two kinds of chain-like J-aggregation70–72 (slip angle less than 54.7°) charge transport tunnels which are stacked in a cross fashion (Fig. 4b and e). Dimer I consists of a pair of “D to A” π–π stacking interactions (ca. 3.46 and 3.46 Å) and dimer II is composed of “A to A” π–π interaction with a distance of ∼3.33 Å, which are elementary units of “D to A” and “A to A” type J-aggregation chain-like channels, respectively. Dimer III, bridging two kinds of J-aggregation channels of MQ7-m, shows a π–π stacking distance of ∼3.35 Å and a rotational angle of 88° between conformational molecules B and R. All three dimers in MQ7-m present more strengthened π–π packing motifs than the counterparts of MQ7-o. And the “edge-to-edge” intermolecular Cl–Cl interaction (ca. 3.38 Å) rigidifies the horizontally aligned adjacent molecules (B and R). Nevertheless, due to the great torsion angle of conformational molecules B (8.08°) in MQ7-m, there is a large dihedral angle (ca. 19°) between the planes of central π cores in these molecules and the planes perpendicular to the direction of π–π stacking (Fig. 4b and S4, ESI†), thereby leading to a 3D interpenetrating networks with disordered π-planes. Specifically, the coupling transfer integral of the dimer I in the single crystal of MQ7-m is calculated to be 9.8 meV (Fig. 5b), higher than that of the counterpart of MQ7-o, which is beneficial for efficient charge transport through 3D networks with rectangular frameworks (length/width: 22.3 Å/15.7 Å) of MQ7-m and in turn leads to its improved carrier mobility.
For MQ7-i, the three types of dimers are composed of three independent molecular conformations (Fig. 4a and d). Dimer I shows an enantiomer with “D to A” π–π stacking (ca. 3.37 Å and 3.40 Å) and a rotational angle of 145° (Fig. S7, ESI†), and possesses stronger electronic coupling than the counterparts of MQ7-m and MQ7-o. The strongest “D to A” π–π interaction among the dimers I of the three materials yields a predominant coupling transfer integral value of 18.5 meV in dimer I of MQ7-i (Fig. 5a). Dimer II shows an enantiomer with “A to A” π–π stacking interaction (ca. 3.34 Å) and a rotational angle of 122°, which also leads to electronic coupling transfer integral as high as 24.8 meV. Similarly, the two types of dimers constitute “D to A” and “A to A” type J-aggregation tunnels, respectively. In MQ7-i, it is noteworthy that each conformational molecule R (Fig. 5a) functions as the nexus of the “D to A” and “A to A” type J-aggregation tunnels, which is beneficial to the corresponding carrier transport between these J-aggregation tunnels. Moreover, the strong π–π interaction (ca. 3.33 Å) and large rotational angle (93°) of dimer III further strengthen the connection between two J-aggregation tunnels. Overall, these dimers with big rotational angles yield a more ordered and compact 3D interpenetrating network with elliptical frameworks (length/width: 28.3 Å/19.8 Å) in the single crystal of MQ7-i, which facilitates the charge transport through 3D single-crystal packing networks and hence yields its champion carrier mobility among the three acceptors.
2.4. Photovoltaic performance
To explore the photovoltaic performance of MQ7-i, MQ7-o and MQ7-m, binary BHJ OSCs were fabricated with a conventional structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDIN/Ag, where PDIN and PEDOT:PSS are 2,9-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)anthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquino-line-1,3,8,10(2H,9H)-tetraone and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate), respectively. The benchmark polymer PM6 was selected as the donor polymer owing to its matched energy levels with the three NFAs (Fig. 2d). The device fabrication details as well as the device optimizations are provided in the ESI (Tables S3–S5†). After the optimization of the device fabrication conditions, the donor/acceptor ratio (by mass) and the volume amount of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additive were chosen as 1:1 and 0.5%, respectively, and the total concentration of the active material solution was fixed at 16 mg mL−1 in chloroform. The annealing condition was fixed at 80 °C for 5 min, for all three materials. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best-performing OSCs are shown in Fig. 6a and b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3. With chlorine atoms in the β- and δ- positions of the benzene of terminals, MQ7-m showed a PCE of 14.54% with a VOC of 0.86 V, an FF of 67.61%, and a JSC of 25.02 mA cm−2. Intriguingly, compared to MQ7-m with the chlorines substituted in the β- and δ-positions of the end-capping benzene ring, MQ7-o with the chlorines substituted in the β- and γ-positions of the benzene ring exhibited a PCE of 15.06% with a VOC of 0.90 V, an FF of 69.50%, and a JSC of 24.07 mA cm−2. The VOC of the MQ7-o-based device is higher than that of the MQ7-m-based device due to the up-shifted LUMO energy level of MQ7-o. Moreover, MQ7-i with the chlorines substituted in the γ- and δ-positions of the end-capping benzene ring exhibited a PCE of 16.23% with a VOC of 0.87 V, an FF of 74.37%, and a JSC of 25.08 mA cm−2, which was the best performance among the three molecules. As shown in Fig. 6b, all three devices exhibit strong light responses ranging from 300 to 900 nm, which is coincident with their absorption properties in pristine neat films. It is noteworthy that MQ7-i-based devices showed a stronger and broader EQE response than that of MQ7-o-based devices, which explains the reason for the high JSC values of the MQ7-i-based OSCs. Although the EQE response of MQ7-m-based devices is broader than that of MQ7-i-based devices, the integrated JSC values of MQ7-m-based devices are lower than those of MQ7-i-based counterparts. At the same time, the integrated JSC values calculated from the EQE spectra were 24.26, 23.22, and 24.14 mA cm−2 for MQ7-i-, MQ7-o-, and MQ7-m-based devices, respectively, which have less than 5% mismatches with the JSC values attained from the J–V curves, indicating the credible results obtained from the J–V measurements.

2.5. Charge separation, transport, and recombination
Photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were implemented to further study the charge transfer behaviors of the blends based on these NFAs. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the PL of PM6 was almost quenched by the acceptors in the blend films, and the PL of the three acceptors was also practically quenched by the PM6 donor. In detail, when excited at 780 nm, the three NFAs showed evident emission peaks of 890 nm for MQ7-i, 884 nm for MQ7-o, and 909 nm for MQ7-m, respectively. The PL quenching efficiency by PM6 of the three acceptors was calculated to gauge the propensity of charge transfer between PM6 and acceptors. The 92.6% quenching efficiency for MQ7-i was higher than those of MQ7-m (91.7%) and MQ7-o (84.7%), indicating that MQ7-i exhibits the most efficient charge transfer between PM6 and MQ7-i.
To get insight into the exciton dissociation behavior and charge extraction process of the three OSCs, the plots of photocurrent (Jph) versus efficient voltage (Veff) were measured (Fig. 6c). The exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdis) can be defined by using the equation of Pdis = Jph/Jsat, in which Jsat is the saturation current density. As Veff ascended, the Jph reached saturation (Jsat) at high Veff (>2.0 V). The Pdis values were calculated to be 94.2% for PM6:MQ7-m-, 94.5% for PM6:MQ7-o-, and 95.4% for PM6:MQ7-i-based devices, respectively. The higher Pdis value indicates the more efficient exciton and charge extraction in OSCs.
To learn the recombination behavior, the correlation between JSC and light intensity (Plight), described as JSC ∝ Plightα, was obtained by recording the J–V curves at different Plight values. The α value indicates the degree of bimolecular recombination, and it is close to 1 when there is minimal or no bimolecular recombination. The α values for PM6:MQ7-m-, PM6:MQ7-o-, and PM6:MQ7-i-based devices were 0.962, 0.988, and 0.994, respectively, indicating that the MQ7-i-based device has the weakest recombination among all three acceptor-based devices. In all, the Pdis and α values for the three different OSCs follow the order of PM6:MQ7-i > PM6:MQ7-o > PM6:MQ7-m, which is consistent with their PCE variation.
To understand the charge transport properties of the three blend films, hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities were measured by using the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. S7, ESI†). From MQ7-o, to MQ7-m, and to MQ7-i, increased μe values in blend films were observed, which was coincident with the enhanced electronic coupling charge transfer values estimated from their crystallographic structures. As tabulated in Table 3, PM6:MQ7-m-based devices had μh and μe values of 4.32 × 10−4 and 1.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 3.39. The most unbalanced μh and μe values for the MQ7-m-based blends are partly responsible for the lowest FF and PCE values. Furthermore, PM6:MQ7-o-based devices showed μh and μe values of 1.65 × 10−4 and 0.97 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 1.70. The low μe value for the MQ7-o-based blend leads to the inferior JSC among the three acceptors. In contrast, PM6:MQ7-i-based devices exhibited μh and μe values of 4.15 × 10−4 and 2.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with a μh/μe ratio of 1.43. The highest and most-balanced μh and μe values for the MQ7-i-based blend facilitate charge transport, thereby leading to the highest FF, JSC, and PCE values among the three acceptors.
2.6. Thin film morphology
To further investigate the molecular stacking and orientation behaviors in these NFA pristine films, the GIWAXS measurements were employed. The 2D GIWAXS patterns, the corresponding 1D linecuts of the films, and the relative data are listed in Fig. 7 and Table S6 (ESI),† respectively. As shown in Fig. 7a–c, for the neat films of the three NFAs, similar patterns and predominantly “face-on” molecular orientation were observed. In the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, the neat film of MQ7-i and MQ7-m exhibited π–π stacking diffraction peaks at 1.80 and 1.79 Å−1, respectively, while the counterpart of MQ7-o was located at 1.77 Å−1, indicating that the π–π stacking distances of MQ7-i (3.49 Å) and MQ7-m (3.50 Å) were smaller than that of MQ7-o (3.54 Å), which was coincident with the tendency in their single-crystal analysis. This result demonstrated that the molecular packing features in the single-crystal arrangement were partially preserved in the solid films. The results suggested that the varied substitution position of chlorine in the terminal groups has a significant impact on the molecular crystallinity and π–π stacking distances. As presented in Fig. 7d–g, MQ7-i, MQ7-o, and MQ7-m blend films all showed intense lamellar diffraction peaks at ∼0.31 Å−1 in the in-plane (IP) direction. However in the OOP direction, MQ7-i, MQ7-o, and MQ7-m blend films exhibited sharp π–π stacking diffraction peaks at 1.76, 1.74, and 1.75 Å−1, respectively, corresponding to the π–π interaction distances of 3.58, 3.61, and 3.59 Å for MQ7-i, MQ7-o, and MQ7-m blend films, respectively, which are in good accord with the trend of the counterparts of the pristine films. Furthermore, fiber-like structures and distinct phase separation features were found in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the three blend films (Fig. S8, ESI†). The similar low root mean square roughness (Rq) values of MQ7-i, MQ7-o, and MQ7-m-based blends (1.07, 0.93, and 0.83 nm, respectively) were beneficial for the formation of good ohmic contact between the interface of active layers and cathodes, which is in favor of efficient charge extraction.

3. Conclusion
In summary, based on three dichlorinated IC terminal groups, a series of novel selenophene-fused asymmetric A–D–A-type NFAs (MQ7-i, MQ7-o, and MQ7-m) were successfully designed, synthesized, and characterized. The impacts of dichlorination positions of terminal groups on the optoelectronic and intermolecular aggregation properties of the three isomeric acceptors and the corresponding photovoltaic performance have been exhaustively studied. Compared to MQ7-i, MQ7-o showed a blue-shifted absorption, while MQ7-m showed a red-shifted absorption, which was ascribed to the varied resonance effects of the chlorine substituted in the end groups. The charge transport behaviors of the three acceptors were tentatively revealed by the crystallographic analysis. From MQ7-o to MQ7-m, and to MQ7-i, the π–π stacking distance was successively reduced as the D–A torsion angles decline. According to our theoretical analysis, the strengthened π–π interaction led to the augmented charge transfer value, hence resulting in the enhanced electron mobility in the solid films of the three acceptors. In detail, the MQ7-o-based device showed a medium PCE and the lowest JSC among the three acceptors owing to its blue-shifted absorption, larger π–π stacking distance, and inadequate π–π packing motifs. Compared to the MQ7-o-based device, the MQ7-m-based device exhibited an increased JSC, thanks to its red-shifted absorption and enhanced carrier mobility. Nevertheless, due to the twisted molecular conformation and weak π–π packing interaction in the J-aggregation charge transport channels, MQ7-m showed an inferior electron mobility to MQ7-i. For MQ7-i, the strong π–π interaction (3.33–3.40 Å) led to the greatest charge transfer values (18.5 meV and 24.8 meV) among the three acceptors, hence yielding a champion electron mobility (2.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) in its solid film. As a result, MQ7-i showed the highest PCE of 16.23% with a JSC of 25.08 mA cm−2 and a FF of 74.37%. Overall, our investigation reveals that the substitution positions of the chlorine atom in the IC terminal groups are crucial for modulating the intermolecular aggregation and orientation, blend film morphology, and device performance of NFAs. Hence, in light of the efficient way to alter intermolecular and intramolecular interactions as well as the packing motifs of NFAs, it can be speculated that the diversity of efficient NFAs with narrow bandgaps will be enriched with the introduction of isomeric dichlorinated terminals. The in-depth crystallographic structure–property investigation on NFAs shall provide new insight into the rationale of high-performance isomeric acceptors.
