    , Accepted 25th January 2023First published on 28th January 2023AbstractThe ternary strategy has been widely demonstrated as an efficient and facile method to improve the performance of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Besides employing commonly used relatively complex molecules or copolymers, developing cost-effective and simple third components with rational structure design and suitable modification also has great potential to construct ternary system with high power conversion efficiency (PCE), though it is challenging. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of simple molecules BR-X (BR-RD, BR-OC8, and BR-C8) based on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene core with the modification of side chains and end-groups as the third components to the host binary PM6:Y6 system for promoting the photovoltaic performance. The ternary system with the addition of BR-RD or BR-C8 demonstrated promoted molecular packing, facilitated exciton dissociation, and charge transportation with obvious suppression of carrier recombination. While BR-OC8 showed a limited role in the improvement of the above performance in its ternary blend. Further investigation indicates that BR-RD and BR-C8 are more inclined to mix with PM6 than Y6 and can be beneficial in the formation of larger pure Y6 domains than those with a binary system and reduced mixed-phase. Thus, ternary devices with BR-RD and BR-C8 achieve highest efficiencies of 17.49% and 17.28% with all simultaneously boosted photovoltaic parameters, respectively, while the ternary device with BR-OC8 exhibits less improvement in PCE compared to that of the host binary one (16.73% vs. 16.42%). This work not only provides an affordable strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance but also enriches the material abundance of novel simple third components to achieve highly efficient ternary OPVs.
Introduction
Over the last few years, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted great attention due to their potential as thin, lightweight, and low-cost power sources.1–5 The development and applicability of OPVs have been progressively advanced owing to great efforts on material design and device engineering, especially the non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).6–11 Benefitting from their easily modified structures, tunable energy levels, and wide absorption in the near-infrared region, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OPVs are over 19%.12–14
To improve the performance of OPVs, a ternary strategy has been developed, by which, the third compound is able to provide effective modulation of light absorption, energy levels, phase separation, and layer's electric properties of the ternary blend by maintaining a simple structure design. With this aim, numerous third compounds were investigated to promote either the device short-circuit current density (Jsc) or open-circuit voltage (Voc) or fill factor (FF) and eventually boost the PCEs.15–17 For the Jsc-increased ternary approach in the earlier research, a low-bandgap compound is usually selected as a near-infrared absorber to extend light absorption, which may cause increased non-radiative energy loss; thus, it is detrimental for retaining high Voc. Based on previous studies and the need for reduction in energy loss (Eloss), the third component is designed or chosen to be a compound with a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level donor or a shallower energy lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level acceptor.18–21 Notably, by a judicious choice of the third component by considering the following points, including complementary absorption ranges, suitable energy levels, compatibility, alloy or parallel, increasing simultaneously all the values of the key photovoltaic parameters can be realized perfectly.
As one of the most successful electron acceptors, Y6 or its derivatives have become the object of extensive research and constructing ternary devices based on the binary system with these molecules as acceptors are considered a convenient and effective strategy to further improve the PCEs. Recently, the PM6:Y6 binary blend has been widely utilized as the host matrix of ternary devices owing to its superior photovoltaic performance. The third component commonly used in the PM6:Y6 binary system includes the following categories: (1) fullerene acceptors and other unusual small molecular materials. Benefiting from the complementary absorption spectra and ability of morphology optimization, both ternary devices with fullerene derivatives PC61BM and PC71BM as the third component obtained boosted PCEs over 16.5%.22,23 Some unusual materials, such as graphdiyne derivative,24 delayed fluorescence material25 and fluorescent organoboron derivative26 were also developed as third components and achieved promising performance; (2) non-fullerene fused-ring small molecular-acceptors. A non-fullerene fused-ring small molecule is the most-reported ternary component due to its superior compatibility with the host acceptor. For instance, Chen et al. constructed ternary OPVs using an alloy-like composite (Y6:BTP-M) as an acceptor, which promoted the PCE to 17.03% with significantly decreased Eloss.27 Based on the similar alloy strategy with higher LUMO energy level, the PCE of the corresponding ternary devices was also further improved and over 17.5% was achieved;20 (3) polymers or small molecular donors. Based on well-designed structures, polymer or small molecular donors with deeper HOMO energy levels than PM6 and good compatibility with PM6 have also been used as the third component, and the ternary devices based on them can raise all the three key parameters of photovoltaic performance simultaneously.28,29 Particularly, based on the intrinsic advantages of definite chemical structure, easier purification method, and less batch variation compared to polymers, large-bandgap small molecules regardless of whether they have complicated conjugated structures show huge potential as third components for high-performance OPVs.30–32 However, studies on the small molecule as a third component are relatively rare, and more work on it should be carried out. Moreover, developing a more effective third component for achieving highly-efficient ternary OPVs is urgently needed.
Based on the above studies, it would appear that adopting suitable small molecules into a binary system to further improve the performance of OPV devices is a viable strategy. We have recently developed a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-based small molecule named BR1 with a simple structure as the third component to construct efficient ternary OPVs.33 The ternary device based on PM6:Y6:BR1 demonstrated a much higher PCE (17.21% vs. 16.23%) and lower Eloss (0.534 vs. 0.552 eV) compared with that of the binary one, which showed that the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structure-based simple molecule with a BDT unit is a promising third component. Therefore, it is appealing to design novel BDT-based third components for the integration of ternary OPVs for higher performance. In this work, three BDT-based simple molecules (BR-X series) with commonly used side chains (hexyl or 2-(ethylhexyl)oxyl) and end-groups (3-ethyl-2-thio-4-thiazolidinone or 3-butyl-2-thio-4-thiazolidinone), namely, BR-C8, BR-OC8, and BR-RD were designed and synthesized, respectively, as third components to construct efficient ternary OPVs. All three molecules exhibited complementary absorption with the PM6:Y6 binary, benefiting light absorption. Superior miscibility was observed between BR-OC8 (or BR-RD) and PM6. Furthermore, the better morphology and crystallinity of the ternary system were demonstrated by the introduction of BR-RD or BR-C8, resulting in enhanced charge extraction, and improved and balanced charge transport ability with reduced charge recombination, while BR-OC8 showed a limited role in the improvement of the above performance in its ternary blend. Thus, the devices based on PM6:Y6:BR-RD and PM6:Y6:BR-C8 showed superior PCEs up to 17.49% and 17.28%, respectively, while the ternary devices based on PM6:Y6:BR-OC8 exhibited a moderate PCE of 16.73%, which is only a small improvement, compared to the host binary one (16.42%). Our results suggest that simple structure-based molecules with rational design have great potential in developing an efficient third component for high-performance OPVs.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures of the PM6, Y6, and BR-X series are shown in Fig. 1a. The synthetic details and characterization data of the BR-X series can be found in the ESI.† All these molecules exhibit decent solubility in the organic solvent of chloroform for facile device fabrication. The decomposition temperatures above 340 °C resulted in 5% weight loss, as observed for all these molecules from thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), indicating their good thermal stability. The UV-vis absorption spectra for PM6, Y6, and BR-X series in film states are shown in Fig. 1b. Based on the same molecular skeleton, compared with BR-C8, BR-OC8 shows obvious broadening in the absorption wavelength range with a smaller bandgap of 1.87 eV. The absorptions of all these three molecules in the short-wavelength region (400–600 nm) were complementary to those of PM6 and Y6, which will be beneficial for obtaining high Jsc. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out to estimate the energy levels of these small molecules, and the results are depicted in Fig. S3 (ESI†) and Fig. 1c. Generally, for A–D–A small molecules, the HOMO energy levels are predominantly determined by the donor moiety and the LUMO energy levels are more related to the terminal acceptor segments.34 Thus, BR-OC8 shows a higher-lying HOMO energy level of −5.54 eV because of the stronger electron-donating ability of the oxyalkyl chain. The above absorption and energy level data are summarized in Table 1.

To evaluate the effect of these simple small molecules of the BR-X series on the device performance, binary and ternary OSCs were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Ag, as shown in Fig. 2a. The weight ratio was kept constant at 1:1.2 for PM6:Y6, both in binary and ternary devices, and all the blend films were treated with thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The ternary organic solar cells were optimized by varying the content of the BR-X series and the optimal weight ratio was 10% based on the weight of the PM6 in binary blends (Table S1, ESI†). Fig. 2b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2, and Table 2 summarizes the related photovoltaic parameters. The PM6:Y6 binary system presented a maximum PCE of 16.42% with Voc of 0.839 V, Jsc of 26.37 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.2%, which were comparable to those reported earlier.26 Both the ternary devices introducing BR-RD and BR-C8 obtained improvements in photovoltaic performance, mainly attributed to the enhancement in Voc and Jsc. Especially, the PM6:Y6:BR-RD-based device exhibited a much higher PCE of 17.49% with Voc of 0.848 V, Jsc of 27.28 mA cm−2, and FF of 75.6%. Meanwhile, PM6:Y6:BR-C8-based devices also yielded a high PCE of 17.28%. The Eloss was extrapolated to 0.556 and 0.565 eV for ternary devices introducing BR-RD and BR-C8 by estimating Eg according to the intersections between the absorption and emission of the acceptors, respectively, which were much smaller than 0.576 eV of the control binary one (Fig. S4, ESI†).35,36 On the other hand, it seems the addition of BR-OC8 did not confer much growth advantage to the device performance and a moderate PCE of 16.73% was achieved, which had only a few improvements on that of the binary one (16.42%). The average PCEs of the ternary devices of PM6:Y6:BR-RD, PM6:Y6:BR-C8, and PM6:Y6:BR-OC8 were 17.28%, 17.12%, and 16.52%, respectively, suggesting a good reproducibility and confirming the positive role of BR-X series on the improvement of photovoltaic performance (Fig. 2c). The Jsc values of the binary and ternary devices were verified by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements. As can be seen from Fig. 2d, the EQE value from 420 to 550 nm was enhanced in all the ternary blends compared to the binary one, which may be attributed to the intense absorption of those BR-X series in the short wavelength region. The integral Jsc calculated from the EQE curves agrees well with the values obtained by the J–V measurements with a mismatch of less than 3%.

To investigate the possibility of intermolecular charge transfer between the BR-X series and PM6, as well as between the BR-X series and Y6 in ternary blends, the photovoltaic devices using PM6, Y6, and Y6:BR-X with a weight ratio of 1:1 and PM6:BR-X with ratios varied from 1:0.8 to 1:1 and 1:1.2, respectively, as the active layers were fabricated (Fig. S5, ESI†). The corresponding device data are listed in Tables S2 and S3 (ESI†). The Jscs of Y6:BR-X series-based devices are similar to that of Y6, suggesting that photoinduced charge transfer does not occur in the Y6:BR-X series blends. For the PM6-based binary blend, all the PM6:BR-X-series-containing binary devices showed increased Jscs compared with the pure PM6-based device, suggesting that some degree of charge carrier transfer occurs between PM6 and BR-X series. Notably, however, the Jsc values of these devices without Y6 acceptors are very low, which is supposed to be caused by the large phase separations, as can be seen in Fig. S10 (ESI†), indicating that the charge transfer between BR-X series and PM6 is not a dominant process in the blends.25 It is hard to say that the BR-X series act as an electron acceptor or electron donor for related ternary OPVs applications. In addition, the high Voc of PM6:BR-RD (0.97 V) and PM6:BR-C8 (0.92 V) are responsible for the improved Voc of the ternary devices.37,38
Generally, the improvement of photovoltaic performance by the introduction of the BR-X series has a positive correlation with the charge carrier dynamics. As shown in Fig. 2e, the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of the devices were plotted to investigate the effect of the addition of the BR-X series on the exciton dissociation and charge collection process in active layers. The ratios of Jsc/Jsat and Jmax/Jsat can be used to represent exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiency, respectively. The related parameters are listed in Table S4 (ESI†). Compared with the binary devices, all the ternary ones show higher Jsc/Jsat and Jmax/Jsat than those of the control binary devices. These results confirmed that the addition of BR-X facilitates the coherent improvement of the exciton dissociation and charge collection process, which is consistent with the increased Jsc in the corresponding device. The charge transport properties of the binary and ternary blend films were investigated by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method and the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobility of these films can be extracted by fitting the dark J–V curves (Fig. S6, ESI†). The host binary PM6:Y6 film exhibited a μh of 2.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 4.96 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μe/μh of 1.69. Ternary device employing BR-RD, BR-C8 and BR-OC8 exhibited increased hole and electron mobilities of 4.53 × 10−4/6.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.29 × 10−4/6.84 × 10−4 and 3.32 × 10−4/5.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 cm2 V−1 s−1, together with μe/μh of 1.43, 1.58, and 1.51, respectively. The effect of BR-RD and BR-C8 addition on improving the charge transport of the ternary blend film is more pronounced than in BR-OC8, in line with the improvement in FF values. This result partially explains why the ternary devices still maintained or obtained higher Jsc and FF values after adding BR-X as the third component besides the obvious enhancement in the Voc value.
The charge recombination of the binary and ternary devices was examined through the Jsc with a change in light intensity (Plight). As depicted by the formula Jsc ∝ PSlight, the bimolecular recombination appears to be lower when the S value is close to 1. As shown in Fig. 2f, the extracted S values of the PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6:BR-RD, PM6:Y6:BR-OC8, and PM6:Y6:BR-C8 systems are 0.980, 0.993, 0.984 and 0.99, respectively. All the S values are equal to unity, indicating minimal biomolecular recombination in all the binary and ternary devices. The smallest α values of PM6:Y6:BR-OC8-based devices suggest the strongest charge recombination among the ternary devices, again verifying that BR-OC8 plays a limited role in the improvement of the photovoltaic performance. To further investigate whether trap-assisted or bimolecular recombination is the dominant mechanism, the relationship between light intensity and Voc was also evaluated (Fig. S7, ESI†). According to the Voc ∝ (nkT/q)ln(Plight) (n is recombination factor, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature and q is an elementary charge), the calculated n values are 1.27, 1.08, 1.28, and 1.19 kT/q for the devices based on PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6:BR-RD, PM6:Y6:BR-OC8, and PM6:Y6:BR-C8, respectively, implying that bimolecular recombination at the open-circuit conditions should be the dominant mechanism in these devices. In addition, smaller slopes of PM6:Y6:BR-RD and PM6:Y6:BR-C8 than that of the binary one, indicating that the addition of BR-RD or BR-C8 could reduce the trap-assisted recombination, thus favoring efficient charge extraction.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies were carried out to characterize the effect of the third component on the morphologies of the blend films. From the AFM images shown in Fig. 3a, the root-mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6:BR-RD, PM6:Y6:BR-OC8, and PM6:Y6:BR-C8 blend films are 0.98, 1.62, 1.28 and 1.22 nm, indicating that the BR-X series as the third component is finely mixed with the host blend and these blend films have good interfacial contact with the charge transport layers and the upper electrode. In addition, the increased Rq after introducing the BR-X series into the PM6:Y6 host blend suggests that the surface morphologies of blend films could be modulated by adding these molecules. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed to investigate the molecular packing in the blend films. The diffraction patterns and line-cuts of corresponding blends along the out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions are depicted in Fig. 3b and c. For the PM6:Y6 blend, a strong (010) diffraction peak at 1.74 Å−1 in the OOP direction and a (100) diffraction peak at 0.29 Å−1 in the IP direction could be observed, suggesting that the PM6:Y6 blend film preferred a face-on orientation. The ternary blend films with BR-X series addition presented diffraction peaks that are similar to that of the controlled binary film because of their good compatibility with the PM6:Y6 blend. Detailed peak fitting was performed to calculate the crystal coherence length (CCL) of the (010) diffraction peak corresponding to π–π stacking in the OOP direction. According to the Scherrer equation, the CCLs associated with π–π stacking were estimated to be 28.6, 30.9, 30.1, and 31.5 Å for PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6:BR-RD, PM6:Y6:BR-OC8, and PM6:Y6:BR-C8 blend films, respectively. These results indicate that the introduction of the BR-X series as the third component leads to a more compacted packing and better crystallinity of the film, which is beneficial for enhancing the charge transport, eventually improving the photovoltaic performance.

As is well known, the miscibility between the third component with the host donor or acceptor is a key factor affecting the morphology of the ternary blends. To understand the working mechanism of the BR-X series in morphology modulation of the PM6:Y6 blends, the miscibility of these materials was investigated based on Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χ) via the two-solvent method using water and glycerol.39 The contact angles are shown in Fig. 4 and the related parameters are displayed in Table S5 (ESI†). The surface energies of PM6, BR-RD, BR-C8, and Y6 are evaluated to be 21.3, 23.8, 22.6, and 29.6 mN m−1, respectively. Then the χ parameter was calculated using the equation χ1,2 ∝ (), and the values are 0.07, 0.02, 0.32, 0.47, and 0.69 for PM6:BR-RD, PM6:BR-C8, Y6:BR-RD, Y6:BR-C8, and PM6:Y6, respectively, suggesting better compatibility of PM6 and BR-RD/BR-C8 than that of PM6 and Y6. In addition, the absorption spectra of PM6:BR-RD, PM6:BR-C8, Y6:BR-RD, Y6:BR-C8, and PM6:Y6 with different weight ratios were characterized. As shown in Fig. 4b, by increasing the BR-RD and BR-C8 addition amounts, the absorption signals of BR-RD and BR-C8 appeared and enhanced in the short-wavelength region in blends of PM6:BR-RD and PM6:BR-C8, respectively. At the same time, the absorption peak of PM6 at 618 nm weakened and exhibited a redshift while the shoulder peak at 578 nm rose gradually in both blends, which implies changed aggregation of PM6. However, few changes were observed for the absorption peak of Y6 in Y6:BR-RD and Y6:BR-C8 blends with different weight ratios. In addition, the absorption spectra of PM6:Y6:BR-RD and PM6:Y6:BR-C8 ternary blends with different BR-RD or BR-C8 weight ratios were also measured, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), and it further proved that the BR-RD or BR-C8 can efficiently improve the absorption in the range of 400–600 nm without having much effect on the longer-wavelength region dominated by Y6, which agrees with the above result. Based on the miscibility and absorption results, it can be inferred that BR-RD and BR-C8 tend to form one phase with PM6 rather than Y6 in the ternary blend films.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were further collected to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge transport behavior in PM6:BR-RD/PM6:BR-C8 and BR-RD:Y6/BR-C8:Y6 blends with excitation at 450 nm and 770 nm, respectively. The PL intensity of Y6 in both the BR-RD:Y6 and BR-C8:Y6 blends gradually enhanced with increasing the content of BR-RD and BR-C8 (Fig. 5a and b), coupled with the overlap in their emission spectra and the absorption spectra of Y6, suggesting the existence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from BR-RD or BR-C8 to Y6, which makes a contribution to enhancing the Jsc of the ternary OSCs.25,40 On the other hand, the PM6:BR-RD and PM6:BR-C8 blend film showed slight quenching compared with the pristine neat film in the absence of enough overlap between the excitation spectrum of PM6 and emission spectrum of BR-RD and BR-C8 (Fig. S9, ESI†). These results indicate that charge transfer occurred between PM6 and BR-RD/BR-C8, which is consistent with the J–V results based on their corresponding binary blend as the aforementioned discussion, although the exciton dissociation efficiency is low.38,41

The charge transfer process in the PM6:Y6:BR-RD and PM6:Y6:BR-C8 blends with much improved photovoltaic performance and control binary blend were further investigated by femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The representative TA spectra at specific delay times and dynamics curves of (a) PM6:BR-RD film and (b) PM6:BR-C8 film are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). We note that the GSB signals of the PM6:BR-RD (or PM6:BR-C8) blend film showed a longer lifetime, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), implying charge transfer may have occurred in the PM6:BR-RD (or PM6:BR-C8) blends, which is consistent with the PL results.42 Since the large LUMO offsets can ensure efficient electron transfer in these three blends, we thus focussed on the hole transfer dynamics in the blend films by choosing an 800 nm laser to selectively excite Y6. The color plot of the TA spectra of the PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6:BR-RD, and PM6:Y6:BR-C8 blend films after the 800 nm excitation is shown in Fig. 5. Both Y6 neat film and blend film exhibited bleach signals in the range of 800∼860 nm (Fig. S8, ESI†), corresponding to the ground-state bleaching (GSB) of the absorption transition in Y6 upon photoexcitation. Meanwhile, new bleach signals in the region of 570∼620 nm emerge in the TA spectra of both the control binary and ternary blends, which is consistent with the steady-state absorption features of PM6, suggesting an ultrafast HT process from Y6 to PM6 in the binary blend and from Y6 to PM6:BR-RD (or PM6:BR-C8) in the ternary blends. In addition, the hole transport dynamics were investigated by probing the GSB signals of the PM6 donor with a three-exponential fit. The ultrafast rising component for PM6:Y6, PM6:Y6:BR-RD, and PM6:Y6:BR-C8 blend films are 1.1, 1.5, and 3.7 ps, and the slower rising parts are 17.3, 60.0 and 44.6 ps, respectively. The fast and slower component can be used to represent the intrinsic hole transfer and the exciton diffusion time, respectively.43,44 The much longer exciton diffusion time in the ternary film indicated larger pure acceptor domains than that of the binary system and reduced mixed-phase.45 Thus, more efficient charge extraction can be achieved in these two ternary devices, which is consistent with the morphology evolution and improved photovoltaic performance.
Conclusion
In summary, three simple-structured molecules BR-C8, BR-OC8, and BR-RD using benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene core with the modification of the side chains and end-groups were developed as third components to improve the photovoltaic performance of OPVs. The significantly improved PCE of 17.49% and 17.28% were acquired in the optimal ternary devices of PM6:Y6:BR-RD and PM6:Y6:BR-C8, with all simultaneously improved photovoltaic parameters. While BR-OC8 addition exhibited a limited role in the improvement of above performance in its ternary blend and only a PCE of 16.73%, which only had slight improvements on that of the host binary one (16.42%). The improved performance can be attributed to the complementary absorption, and good compatibility with PM6 and BR-RD/BR-C8, which led to improved photon-harvesting, enhanced, and balanced charge mobility, suppressed charge recombination as well as optimized morphology in their respective ternary devices. The limited improvement in charge transport and morphology of the BR-OC8-based ternary blend is responsible for the moderate PCE of its ternary devices. This work enriches the structural diversity of third components and suggests that simple structure-based molecules with rational design have great potential in developing an efficient third component for high-performance OPVs.

Device fabrication
The photovoltaic devices were fabricated with a structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Donor:Acceptor/PDINO/Ag. The ITO-coated glass substrates were washed with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min each under ultrasonication and dried using a nitrogen gun. The PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated (ca. 30 nm thick) onto the cleaned ITO surface. The substrates were then transferred to the glove box after being annealed at 150 °C for 20 min. PM6, Y6, and BR-X series were dissolved in chloroform with different weight ratios. The weight ratio of PM6:Y6 was kept at 1:1.2 with 0.5 vol% CN as the solvent additive for all solutions. As for the devices based on PM6:BR-X and Y6:BR-X blends with different weight ratios of BR-X, all the blends were dissolved in chloroform at a total weight concentration of 12 mg mL−1. Subsequently, all the active layers were treated with thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, PDINO, with a concentration of 2.0 mg mL−1 using methanol solvent, was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 40 s on the active layer. Finally, a 100 nm Ag layer was deposited on the PDINO layer under a high vacuum (<1.5 × 10−4 Pa). The active area of the devices was 5.7 mm2.
