    , Accepted 1st June 2021First published on 1st June 2021AbstractComputational approaches for the design of small-molecule triphenylamine-derivative-based hole-transporting materials (HTMs) are a highly efficient way to acquire potential HTMs for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, based on our developed theoretical model, a class of potential arylamine-derivative-based HTMs (CQ1–CQ3) with different conjugated π-bridge groups was designed, and the materials exhibited better performance in comparison with the parent HTM X25. To verify the computational model and obtain the potential HTMs, the promising HTM CQ2 was synthesized and applied in a PSC device. The results reveal that the experimental data we obtained in this paper reproduced the theoretical results, such as the frontier molecular orbital energy, optical properties, and hole mobilities, very well. Compared to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) (14.39%) of the X25-based PSC, the dopant-free CQ2-based PSC exhibits a better PCE of 15.21% because of its improved short-circuit current and fill factor values. This study demonstrates that computational approaches are a feasible way to obtain potential HTMs in order to economize the cost of development of new HTMs.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSC) have attracted great attention because of the excellent optoelectronic properties of the light absorbers (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3−xClx), such as tunable band gaps, broad optical absorption, long charge-diffusion length, and good charge transport.1–5 At present, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSC devices has reached about 25%.6 Generally, the architecture of a PSC device consists of a transparent electrode, an electron-transporting layer (ETL), a perovskite, a hole-transporting layer (HTL) and a metal electrode.7–9 In the architecture of PSC devices, the hole-transporting materials (HTMs) of the hole-transporting layer play a vital role in transporting holes to the metal electrode to improve the PSC device performance. For instance, Li et al.10 reported that three new HTMs exhibited different efficiencies in PSC devices. Under the same conditions, the PCEs of PSCs with IDF-SFXPh and IDF-TeDPA as HTMs were 17.6% and 12.7%, respectively. Therefore, the development on HTMs with high mobility and appropriate frontier molecular orbital levels is a necessary condition to improve the performance of PSC devices.11,12
Currently, Spiro-OMeTAD is one of the most widely used and successful high-efficiency HTMs in PSCs.13,14 Due to the low conductivity and hole mobility of the Spiro-OMeTAD films, high PCEs are usually obtained by adding dopants such as 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) and lithium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI). The use of dopants has been shown to lead to more complex device fabrication and rapid deterioration of devices, ultimately affecting the stability of the PSCs.15,16 Therefore, it is imperative to develop new dopant-free small-molecule HTMs. For instance, Tang et al.17 reported that a device based on a dopant-free D–A–D-type HTM (DTP-C6Th) with the device structure FTO/SnO2/C60-SAM/MA0.7FA0.3Pb(I0.925Br0.075)3/HTM/Au exhibited a PCE of 21.04%. Jen et al.18 reported two D–A–D-type HTMs (BTF-5 and BTF-6); the PCE of the developed PSC devices based on BTF-6 as a dopant-free HTM was 20.34%. Grätzel et al.19 reported an HTM (MeOTTVT), and the PCEs of conventional PSC devices using MeOTTVT-based dopant-free HTMs reached up to 21.30%. Wu et al.20 reported two D–A–D-type HTMs (TQ3 and TQ4); the PCE of planar n–i–p PSC devices based on TQ4 as a dopant-free HTM was 21.03%. Although previous studies have reported that dopant-free organic small HTMs can achieve good PCEs, the development of high-performance dopant-free HTMs with low cost and high stability in order to facilitate further application of PSCs remains a challenge.
Quantum chemistry, especially molecular modeling techniques for organic materials, is an important method for obtaining useful information and identifying potential HTMs. The parameters of HTMs, such as their geometric structure, electronic properties, optical absorption, and charge mobility, can be simulated using density-functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) and Marcus theory.21–25 For instance, He et al.26 reported that three dopant-free HTMs (Y-1, Y-2 and Y-3) were investigated via DFT, TD-DFT and Marcus theory. The potential HTMs Y-1, Y-2 and Y-3 were then synthesized to further PSC applications. In our previous works, based on molecular simulations, we obtained some potential HTMs by controlling the conjugated π-bridge units in bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)amine-based HTMs to improve the hole mobility.27,28 The promising HTMs based on the theoretical model were thus synthesized and further applied to the PSC devices. This approach can reduce the development cost of new materials and shorten the development period.
Triphenylamine derivatives, as electron-donating groups, are widely used to construct HTMs with a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structure.29–31 The methoxy groups in triphenylamine-derivative HTMs can interact with the methylammonium sites of the perovskite (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) in PSC devices.28,32–34 HTMs based on triphenylamine derivatives as an electron-donating group and various π-conjugated bridges as electron-deficient units exhibited obviously different performances in PSC devices.29,30,35,36 For instance, Loo and co-workers reported two HTMs, YZ18 and YZ22, consisting of triphenylamine derivatives and different π bridge units. The PCEs of PSC devices based YZ18 and YZ22 as HTMs were 18.1% and 22.4%, respectively.37 Obviously, for triphenylamine-derivative-based HTMs, modulation of the conjugated π-bridge groups is a feasible approach to change the properties of the HTMs, such as tuning their energy levels and improving their hole-transporting ability to some extent.37–40
Herein, we focused on revealing the influence of the conjugated π-bridge groups on the performance of triphenylamine-derivative-based HTMs and developing a reliable computational model with which to screen the potential HTMs for PSC applications. Using the triphenylamine derivatives as electron-donating groups and various conjugated π-bridge groups as electron-deficiency units, the HTMs CQ1–CQ3 were designed as shown in Fig. 1. Starting from our developed computational model, their geometric structures, electronic information, frontier molecular orbital energy levels, optical properties and hole-transporting ability were investigated by employing DFT and TD-DFT combined with Marcus theory and compared with those of X25.41 The hole mobility of X25 is 1.51 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1.42 Using the device structure FTO/c-TiO2/meso-TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Au and doped X25 as the HTM, the PCE is 17.4%, with a Jsc of 22.5 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.100 V and an FF of 70%.41 In consideration of the synthesis cost, performance of the reference molecules and structure similarity, we chose X25 as the reference. In order to verify the theoretical model, the potential HTM CQ2 was synthesized and applied to the PSC device. The optical properties, electrochemical measurements, hole mobility and device performance of dopant-free CQ2 and the corresponding PSCs were investigated and compared with those of X25. The results revealed that the experimental data we obtained in this paper reproduced the theoretical results, such as the HOMO, LUMO, optical properties and hole mobility, very well. This study demonstrates that computational approaches are a feasible way to obtain potential HTMs in order to economize the development cost for new HTMs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Theoretical simulations and material design
In the work, a class of small-molecule triphenylamine-derivative-based HTMs were designed based on the reported HTM X25 (Fig. 1). Their properties, such as electronic structure, optical properties, solubility, stability and charge-transporting ability were studied using DFT and TD-DFT in combination with Marcus theory. The aim was to obtain potential triphenylamine-derivative-based HTMs from the developed theoretical model.
In order to evaluate the energy level matching between the HTMs and the perovskite (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3−xClx), the electronic properties and frontier molecular orbital levels of the HTMs were calculated using DFT. The geometrical structures of X25 and CQ1–CQ3 are provided in Fig. 1. The optimized structures of X25 and CQ1–CQ3 obtained using the B3P86 functional and 6-311G(d,p) basis set are presented in Fig. S1.† The parameters of the HOMO and LUMO of X25 and CQ1–CQ3 can be evaluated from the equations:43 HOMO(exp.) = 0.66HOMO(th.) − 1.75, R = 0.79(1) LUMO(exp.) = 0.69LUMO(th.) − 1.07, R = 0.88(2)
The calculated HOMO and LUMO values of X25 and CQ1–CQ3 based on the results of the B3P86/6-311G(d,p) calculations and eqn (1) and (2) are listed in Fig. 2(a). The calculated results show that the HOMO (−5.20 eV) and LUMO (−2.11 eV) of X25 are in line with the experimental data (HOMO: −5.22 eV and LUMO: −1.99 eV (ref. 42)). Fig. 2(a) shows that the HOMO energy values follow the order CQ2 (−5.32 eV) > CQ1 (−5.31 eV) = CQ3 (−5.31 eV) > X25 (−5.20 eV). According to eqn (2), the calculated energy values of the LUMO (Fig. 2(a)) for CQ1–CQ3 are −2.26, −2.25 and −2.26 eV, respectively. Compared to the valence band (VB) (−5.43 eV (ref. 44)) and conduction band (CB) (−3.93 eV (ref. 44)) of the perovskite (e.g., CH3NH3PbI3−xClx), the HOMO and LUMO levels of molecules CQ1–CQ3 match very well for PSC applications. The energy values of the HOMO of CQ1–CQ3 are higher than the VB for CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, ensuring hole injection at the perovskite/HTM interface. The energy values of the LUMO for CQ1–CQ3 are higher than the CB of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx, preventing the charge moving from the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx to the metal electrodes.

(c) Electron density difference plots for the electronic transition S0 → S1 for X25 and CQ1–CQ3 (isovalue: 4 × 10−4 e per au3); w is the overlap between the regions of density depletion and increase, Δq is the transferred charge amount ((|e−|)), and ΔD is the electron transfer distance (Å). 
In addition, as shown in Fig. 2(a), the HOMOs of X25 and CQ1–CQ3 are delocalized over the whole molecular skeleton. The LUMOs of X25 and CQ1–CQ3 are localized at the conjugated π-bridge groups. Obviously, the electron density distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals demonstrates that the conjugated π-bridges are the electron-deficient units and the triphenylamine derivatives are the electron-donating groups in these HTMs. The HOMO orbital distributions over the whole molecular skeletons of these HTMs are conducive to promoting the coupling strength of the neighboring molecules in a molecular arrangement.45Fig. 2(a) demonstrates that the HOMO distribution of CQ1–CQ3 over the whole molecular skeleton may promote the hole mobility of these HTMs in PSC devices.38
The calculated optical properties of X25 reveal that the TD-BMK functional and 6-31G(d) basis set in dichloromethane can output a reasonable absorption peak (328 nm) in keeping with the experimental data (335 nm (ref. 42)). Hence, the optical absorption and emission properties for CQ1–CQ3 were simulated using the TD-BMK/6-31G(d) functional and basis set in dichloromethane. Simulated absorption spectra of molecules CQ1–CQ3 are presented in Fig. 2(b). The optical absorption and emission parameters for CQ1–CQ3 are presented in Table 1. The maximum absorption in the S0–S1 states for CQ1–CQ3 are mainly from the HOMO → LUMO transitions. As presented in Table 1 and Fig. 2(b), the λabs (maximum absorption wavelength) and f (oscillator strength) of CQ1–CQ3 are 322 nm (1.42), 327 nm (1.16), and 327 nm (1.06), respectively.

As listed in Table 1, for the molecules X25 and CQ1–CQ3, the emission wavelengths (λem) are 399, 394, 404 and 405 nm, respectively. The calculated Stokes shift values of X25 and CQ1–CQ3 follow the order X25 (71 nm) < CQ1 (72 nm) < CQ2 (77 nm) < CQ3 (78 nm). The Stokes shift of an HTM is defined as the difference between the emission wavelength and maximum absorption wavelength. For an organic material, large Stokes shifts can result in a change of material structure between the ground state and excited state.46 For the HTMs in PSCs, large Stokes shifts are conducive to pore filling.47 In comparison with X25, the HTMs CQ1–CQ3 with larger Stokes shifts might be favorable to enhance the performance of PSC devices.
In the electron-density-difference (EDD) plots for CQ1–CQ3 in Fig. 2(c), the colors of purple and blue indicate decreased and increased electron densities. The values of transferred charge amount (Δq) (|e−|) of X25 and CQ1–CQ3 are 1.689, 1.837, 1.809 and 1.787, respectively. The values of Δq are strongly relative to the electron withdrawing abilities of the π-bridge groups in CQ1–CQ3. Large values of Δq favor charge separation, which promotes the performance of the HTMs in PSC devices. In addition, the corresponding parameters, including the electron transfer distance (ΔD) and the overlap between regions of density depletion and increment (w), are listed in Fig. 2(c). Generally, larger values of ΔD and smaller values of w represent better charge separation efficiency. The w values of X25 and CQ1–CQ3 are 0.40, 0.21, 0.24 and 0.20, respectively. Compared to the experimental molecule (X25), the designed molecules CQ1–CQ3 all have smaller w values. Moreover, the ΔD values of X25 and CQ1–CQ3 follow the order CQ2 (12.427 Å) > CQ3 (11.391 Å) > CQ1 (11.352 Å) > X25 (9.623 Å). In summary, CQ1–CQ3 not only have larger ΔD and lower w values, but also higher Δq values compared to X25, which demonstrates that the HTMs CQ1–CQ3 can ensure charge separation and eventually improve the PSC performance.
Generally, in order to yield a good coating of HTM film on the perovskite film in PSCs, the HTM should be highly soluble in the solvent (e.g., chlorobenzene). The parameter solvation free energy (ΔG) can be used to evaluate the solubility of an HTM theoretically.45 ΔG can be defined as the difference of the free energy for the HTMs in the solvent and the gas phase.45 Chlorobenzene is the most commonly used solvent for preparing PSC devices. As listed in Table 2, with chlorobenzene as the solvent, the ΔG values for X25 and CQ1–CQ3 are −13.42, −11.69, −12.00 and −11.31 kcal mol−1, respectively. In addition, absolute hardness (η) can be used to evaluate the stability of an organic material.45 The calculated values of η for X25 and CQ1–CQ3 are 3.01, 3.04, 3.02 and 3.01 eV, respectively (Table 2). In comparison to those of X25, the low ΔG and η values of the molecules CQ1–CQ3 indicate that the designed HTMs may have good solubility and stability.

For an HTM, good hole-transport ability favors improved performance in PSC devices. Marcus theory is an important theoretical method for describing the charge-transport ability of an organic material (e.g. HTMs).43,50 According to Marcus theory, charge-transfer rates (kCT) are influenced by two major parameters: the inner reorganization energy (λ) and the electron transfer integral (v).48 HTMs with a small λ and a large v value contribute to high kCT in PSCs. As shown in Table 3, the values of λ for X25 and CQ1–CQ3 are 0.462, 0.331, 0.166 and 0.168 eV, respectively. In comparison to X25, the designed HTMs CQ1–CQ3 with their smaller λ values may improve the hole mobility. The smaller λ values of CQ1–CQ3 compared to that of X25 can be explained as a result of the optimization of the electron-deficiency of the π-bridge groups in the triphenylamine-derivative-based HTMs. Therefore, adjusting the π-bridge group core in triphenylamine-derivative-based HTMs is a feasible method to reduce the λ. For an organic material, the transfer integral v is influenced by the HOMO orbital distribution and the coupling strength of the neighboring molecules in the molecular arrangement.45 Hence, in order to calculate the parameter v, the structures of intermolecular arrangements of CQ1–CQ3 should be obtained. Universally, the structures of intermolecular stacks of HTMs can be acquired from their crystal data. Theoretically, the polymorphic module of the software Material Studio can yield the crystal structures of HTMs.49 The detailed information is presented in the SI. The calculated crystal structures with the lowest total energies for X25 and CQ1–CQ3 have the P1 space group. The corresponding crystal structures are given in Fig. S2.†

The hole mobility (uh) of X25 and CQ1–CQ3 can be computed using the Einstein relation the basis of the hole-transfer rate (kh) combined with the Marcus equation.43 The calculation details are presented in the SI. The main hole-hopping pathways of X25 and CQ1–CQ3 are presented in Fig. 3. The parameters λh, vh, kh, center-of-mass distance (D), and uh of X25 and CQ1–CQ3 are presented in Table 3. As listed in Table 3, according to the simulated crystal structures and corresponding hole-hopping pathways (Fig. 3), the calculated uh (1.62 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) of X25 is two orders of magnitude larger than that the experimental uh (1.51 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).42 Relatively, in this work, the theoretical results of the present theoretical model are acceptable for use in evaluating the hole-transporting ability of the designed HTMs. As shown in Table 3, the result indicates that the calculated values of uh for CQ1–CQ3 are 1.38 × 10−2, 5.38 × 10−2 and 2.96 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The larger uh values of the HTMs CQ1–CQ3 compared to that of X25 are attributed to a large transfer integral or a small recombination energy. Hence, in consideration of their good uh values, the performance of PSC devices based on the designed CQ1–CQ3 as the HTM may be promoted.

Using the computational model we developed, the theoretical results indicated that CQ1–CQ3 exhibit potential performance as HTMs in PSC applications with good stability, larger Stokes shifts, higher hole mobility and good solubility in comparison to X25. Conclusively, tuning the conjugated π-bridge groups of triphenylamine-derivative-based HTMs is a feasible method, providing the promising candidate HTMs CQ1–CQ3 for PSC applications.
2.2. Synthesis and material characterization
Based on our developed theoretical model, a class of potential triphenylamine-derivative-based HTMs (CQ1–CQ3) with different conjugated π-bridge groups as electron-deficient units were designed and exhibited better performance compared to the parent HTM X25. In this work, the simulated results for the parent X25 demonstrated that the screened computational methods could yield accurate HOMO/LUMO energy, hole-mobility and optical absorption values in line with the experimental results. In order to verify the computational model and obtain the potential HTMs, the molecule CQ2 was targeted for further synthesis and applied to a PSC device because of its good properties with large Stokes shifts, good stability, good solubility and the highest hole mobility. Hence, taking X25 as a reference, the photo-physical properties of CQ2 were studied.

X25 and CQ2 were synthesized in one step through a simple Suzuki cross-coupling reaction. The synthesis process of CQ2 is shown in Fig. 4(a). The target product was characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectrometry (MS). The detailed synthesis process and the material characterization can be found in Fig. S3–S6 of the ESI.†CQ2 exhibits good solubility in common organic solvents, such as toluene, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, chlorobenzene, dichloromethane, etc.

The optoelectronic properties of CQ2 were investigated and compared with those of X25. As shown in Fig. 4(b) and Table 4, the optical properties of CQ2 and X25 were measured in dichloromethane. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the absorption peak maxima of CQ2 and X25 are 336 and 334 nm, respectively. The absorption onsets are 385 and 394 nm, respectively, which correspond to optical energy gaps (Eg) of 3.22 and 3.15 eV, respectively. As shown in Tables 1 and 4, our measured absorption maximum (336 nm) for CQ2 is in good agreement with the calculated value (327 nm) in dichloromethane solution.

The electrochemical properties of CQ2 and X25 were determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) as shown in Table 4 and Fig. 4(c). The values of the HOMO energy levels for X25 and CQ2 are −5.22 eV and −5.29 eV, respectively. The results indicated that the HOMO levels of CQ2 can match well with the VB of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (−5.43 eV (ref. 44)) in PSC devices. The values of the LUMO energy levels for X25 and CQ2 are estimated to be −2.00 eV and −2.14 eV, respectively. Clearly, the energy level of LUMO for CQ2 is higher than the CB of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (−3.93 eV (ref. 44)), which can effectively prevent electron transfer from the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx to the metal electrodes. In addition, the trends in the energy values of the HOMO and LUMO for X25 and CQ2 are consistent with our previous theoretical calculation results. The calculated HOMO/LUMO levels of X25 and CQ2 are −5.20 eV/−2.11 eV and −5.32 eV/−2.25 eV respectively, (see Fig. 2(a)), confirming the reliability of the selected calculation method.
The hole mobilities of CQ2 and X25 were investigated using a space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method under dark conditions.29 Using the hole-only ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTMs/MoO3/Ag devices, the current–voltage (J–V) responses were measured and are shown in Fig. 4(d). As listed in Table 4, the hole mobility of dopant-free CQ2 (1.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is higher than that of dopant-free X25 (5.81 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Additionally, the trend of the experimental values was consistent with the theoretical calculations. The calculated hole mobilities of X25 and CQ2 are 1.62 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.38 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (see Table 3). The experimental value of hole mobility is lower than the calculated value, which would mostly be affected by the morphology.51 In other words, the hole mobility was calculated using the predicted crystal structure and the experiment was based on an amorphous film.
The above results all indicate that CQ2 may be a more promising HTM for PSC applications in comparison with X25. In consideration of the suitable HOMO energy and good hole mobility of CQ2, the device configuration ITO/SnO2/C60/MAPbI3−xClx/HTMs/MoO3/Ag (shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b)) was fabricated in order to study the performance of CQ2 in PSC applications.

2.3. Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the device performance of PSCs based on dopant-free CQ2 and X25 as HTMs, PSC devices with the conventional structure ITO/SnO2/C60/perovskite/HTMs/MoO3/Ag were used. It is well known that the thickness of the HTM film is an important factor affecting the performance of PSC devices. Hence, the HTMs (CQ2 and X25) were solubilized in chlorobenzene at concentrations of 8 mg mL−1, 10 mg mL−1, 12 mg mL−1 and 14 mg mL−1. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the CQ2- and X25-based devices with different concentrations are presented in Fig. S7,† and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table S2.† The results show that the best device performance was achieved at an HTM concentration of 12 mg mL−1. Fig. 5(c) depicts the J–V curves of the best devices based on the HTMs X25 and CQ2 under simulated one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5 G), and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 5. The best device based on CQ2 exhibits a Jsc of 20.57 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.018 V, and an FF of 72.65%, resulting in a PCE of 15.21%. Under the same conditions, the best-performing X25-based device exhibits a slightly lower PCE of 14.39%, with a Jsc of 19.64 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.012 V and an FF of 72.42%. The higher Jsc and FF values in the CQ2-based devices were attributed to its higher hole mobility.39 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs based on X25 and CQ2 are presented in Fig. 5(d). High EQE over a broad range of 400–700 nm is observed for both the X25- and CQ2-based devices. The EQE value and integrated Jsc values of the CQ2-based devices are higher than those of the X25-based devices.

Furthermore, the J–V curves under the reverse and forward voltage scanning directions are shown in Fig. S8,† and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table S3.† The hysteresis index (HI) was calculated according to the equation HI = [PCE(Forward) − PCE (Reverse)]/PCE(Forward).18 The hysteresis of both CQ2 and X25 devices are correlated with defects, ion migration, ferroelectric polarization, trap-assisted charge recombination and slow dynamic processes of imbalanced charge transport or interface separation.52–55 Moreover, various factors such as cell structure, morphology, material phases, and test conditions influence the hysteresis behavior in perovskite solar cells.56 In order to study the reproducibility of the PCE of the PSC devices based on the HTMs X25 and CQ2, average PCE histograms based on 20 identical devices with X25 and CQ2 are shown in Fig. S9,† and the statistical parameters of the X25- and CQ2-based devices are provided in Table 5. Fig. S10† presents the box charts of the photovoltaic parameters for X25 and CQ2. As shown in Fig. S9 and S10,† the results demonstrate that both X25 and CQ2 show excellent reproducibility in PSC devices. The stability tests of the PSCs based on CQ2 and X25 as the HTMs without encapsulation were performed under continuous one sun illumination in N2 conditions, as displayed in Fig. S11.† It is noted that both the CQ2- and X25-based device show good stability.
2.4. Hole extraction and charge recombination at interfaces
The uniform and complete spin-coating of the HTM film on the surface of the perovskite layer is extremely important for reducing charge recombination and ultimately obtaining better performance in the PSC device. The morphologies of the HTM films spin-coated on the perovskite layer were investigated using an atomic force microscope (AFM), as shown in Fig. 6(a)–(c). The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the perovskite layer was 18.9 nm; this value was significantly reduced after spin-coating with the different HTMs. X25 and CQ2 were formed on top of the perovskite layer, and the RMS roughness was 8.3 and 7.4 nm, respectively. In addition, some articles have pointed out that the introduction of S atoms can increase the range of electron delocalization.17,57 There is an interaction between the S atoms and Pb ions in the perovskite, which can passivate surface defects in the perovskite crystals and provide stronger intermolecular interactions.58–60 Hence, the smaller RMS roughness of the CQ2 film compared to that of X25 may be the due to the role of the S atoms. It is implied that there is better interface contact between the perovskite layer and the CQ2-based HTM film, thereby promoting good charge transfer and suppressing recombination loss, and ultimately increasing the Voc and FF of the CQ2-based device.

In order to study the capability of hole extraction from the perovskite to the HTMs, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed. As illustrated in Fig. 6(d), it is worth noting that the bare perovskite layer has a strong PL peak at around 700–850 nm under excitation at 467 nm. When the PL emission of the perovskite layer coated with X25 and CQ2 was measured, both showed quenched PL intensity. CQ2 yielded a higher quenching efficiency compared to X25, indicating that CQ2 leads to more efficient charge transfer from the perovskite to CQ2. Interestingly, the PL peaks of the perovskite/X25 and perovskite/CQ2 double-layer films exhibit a significant blue shift, which may be caused by the chemical interaction between the HTMs and the perovskite.61 Time-resolved photoluminescence decay (TRPL) measurements on the bare perovskite film and perovskite/HTMs bi-layer were conducted to study the hole extraction efficiencies. As shown in Fig. 6(e), the pristine perovskite film exhibited a long fitted decay lifetime (71 ns) with a double-exponential time constant. After spin-coating the X25 and CQ2 HTMs on the perovskite layer, the average fitted lifetimes were shortened to 14 ns and 11 ns, respectively. The CQ2-based devices exhibit a faster decay response than the X25 ones, demonstrating its more efficient hole-extraction ability due to its higher hole mobility. The PL and TRPL results provide a good explanation for the more efficient performance of the CQ2-based devices.
3. Conclusions
In the work, a series of potential arylamine-derivative-based HTMs (CQ1–CQ3) with different conjugated π-bridge groups was designed, and the materials exhibited better performance compared to the parent HTM X25 based on investigations using DFT and TD-DFT in combination with Marcus theory. In particular, the designed material CQ2 exhibits good potential performance with good stability, a larger Stokes shift, higher hole mobility, and good solubility. To verify the computational model and obtain potential HTMs, the promising example CQ2 was synthesized and applied in a PSC device. The results reveal that the experimental data we used in this paper can reproduce the theoretical results, such as the frontier molecular orbital energy, optical properties, and hole mobilities, very well. In addition, in comparison to the PCE (14.39%) of the X25-based device, the dopant-free CQ2-based PSC exhibits an excellent PCE of 15.21% because of its improved short-circuit current and fill factor values. This study demonstrates that computational approaches are a feasible way to obtain potential HTMs in order to reduce the development costs of new materials and shorten the development period.
