    , Accepted 20th September 2018First published on 22nd September 2018AbstractA highly stable Sb based anode material of well-confined Sb@graphene@carbon (Sb@G@C) was developed for high performance PIBs. The Sb@G@C electrode exhibits a reversible capacity of 474 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 (second charge), an outstanding long cycle stability over 800 cycles with a capacity retention as high as 72.3% and an excellent rate performance.
With the rapid development of renewable energy resources, such as solar energy, wind energy and water energy, it is urgently needed to seek for low-cost and highly efficient energy storage devices in order to store clean energy efficiently due to the regionalism and intermittency defects of renewable energy.1–7 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used in portable electronic devices and have been used in electric vehicles recently due to their high energy and power density. Nevertheless, concerns about LIBs have arisen due to the high cost and limited lithium resources. Therefore, great efforts have been made in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium ion batteries (PIBs) due to their merits of low cost and abundant resource.8–13 Potassium ion batteries (PIBs) have more advantages, especially the more negative standard electrode potential (−2.93 V vs. E0) and fast kinetics of K ions in solvents, which are conductive to obtain high energy density and superior rate performance.14–16 Besides, the merits of low cost and abundant supply of potassium resources also make PIBs a promising candidate for large scale energy storage devices.17–24
In the past several years, considerable research efforts have been devoted to exploring optional materials for PIBs. To date, various materials including carbonaceous materials,15,25–31 alloy compounds,16,32–34 and sulfides35–38 have been developed for PIBs. Although carbonaceous materials for PIBs have been demonstrated to have excellent cycle stability and rate performance, their capacity is very limited below 300 mA h g−1. By contrast, alloying-type electrodes (stannum (Sn), phosphorus (P), antimony (Sb), and bismuth (Bi)) have attracted considerable interest due to their appropriate potential and high theoretical specific capacities.16,33,39–43 Among them, Sb possesses a low alloy-potential and a high theoretical capacity of 660 mA h g−1. Besides, the electrical conductivity of Sb is much superior to those of P and Sn, making it a promising anode for PIBs. However, the pure Sb electrode undergoes significant volume changes during potassiation/depotassiation processes and may cause fracture of the active material and loss of electrical contacts, resulting in rapid capacity fading. To address these issues, 3D carbon network confined Sb,39 balling Sb with super P,43 and development of new electrolytes33 have been reported. However, the cycle stability of Sb-based electrodes is still limited below 100 cycles. Therefore, it is urgently needed to develop an efficient strategy of Sb based electrodes with long cycle stability.
Herein, we design and construct confined Sb nanoparticles with carbon, denoted as Sb@G@C, for high-performance PIBs, achieving a long cycle stability and superior rate performance. The enhanced electrochemical performances of Sb@G@C are due to the small size and uniform distribution of Sb nanoparticles, which can provide a short ion diffusion distance and reduce the strain generated during the potassiation/depotassiation processes. Besides, the graphene framework and carbon layer could suppress the aggregation of Sb nanoparticles and buffer the large volume change during the charge and discharge processes. As a result, the PIBs with the Sb@G@C electrode exhibit a high reversible capacity, an outstanding long cycle stability over 800 cycles with a capacity retention as high as 72.3% (the longest cycle stability of an Sb-based electrode obtained for PIBs to date).
In order to investigate the composition and structure of the synthesized materials, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected for the Sb@G@C composite. The XRD patterns of the Sb@G@C samples (550, 650 and 750 °C) are highly consistent with the rhombohedral phase of Sb (PDF #35-0732), manifesting that the Sb3+ was completely reduced to metallic Sb after thermal reduction (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1, ESI†). To investigate the accurate content of Sb in Sb@G@C composites, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed (Fig. 1b and Fig. S2, ESI†). The slight weight increase from 260 to 430 °C can be attributed to the oxidation reaction of Sb to Sb2O4 under an air atmosphere.44 The following weight loss from 430 to 570 °C is mainly due to the combustion of carbon in air, and the decrease in weight of the Sb@G@C composites at 550, 650 and 750 °C are 65.9%, 59.4% and 39.6%, respectively. Considering the final product of these materials is Sb2O4, the Sb content could be further calculated to be 52.3%, 47.1%, and 31.4% at 550, 650 and 750 °C, respectively. The gradually reduced Sb content with increasing temperature might be due to the partial evaporation at high temperature in consideration of the low melting point of Sb (630 °C).

The morphology and structure of Sb@G@C at different temperatures (550, 650 and 750 °C) were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. S3, ESI†). For all the Sb@G@C composites, Sb nanoparticles are embedded or deposited on the graphene framework, while the carbon layer is coated on the Sb particle surface like a blanket, leading to confined Sb with a carbon structure. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to further explore the fine structure of the synthesized Sb@G@C (Fig. 1c and Fig. S4, ESI†). It could be seen that at a relatively low temperature of 550 °C (Fig. S4a, ESI†), Sb would not melt and thus the Sb particles are distributed non-uniformly. On the other hand, Sb particles are melted and easily aggregate with each other and further aggregate to large Sb particles when the treatment temperature is as high as 750 °C (Fig. S4b, ESI†).
By contrast, with a moderate heating temperature of 650 °C, the Sb is melted with excellent fluidity, and it could infiltrate into the confined carbon layer effortlessly. The TEM image of the Sb@G@C (650 °C) composite in Fig. 1c and Fig. S5 (ESI†) reveals that the Sb nanoparticles are well confined by the carbon layer. Besides, the Sb nanoparticles are uniformly distributed in the carbon layer due to the suitable temperature. The nano-dispersion of Sb in Sb@G@C can shorten the diffusion and transferring distance of potassium ions and increase the reaction surface area, which is conductive to obtain a high rate performance. Furthermore, the graphene matrix along with the carbon layer could enhance the electronic conductivity and suppress the aggregation of Sb nanoparticles effectively during the charge–discharge processes.
The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of Sb@G@C (650 °C) is shown in Fig. 1d, and the obtained sample shows a characteristic spacing of 0.380 nm, corresponding to the (003) lattice planes of metallic Sb. Such a unique structure of Sb@G@C is capable of restricting the aggregation of Sb and increasing the interface contact of Sb with the graphene framework and carbon layer, which could promote the electrochemical performance of Sb@G@C.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a useful electroanalytical technique to investigate the mechanism of electrode materials at different potentials during charge/discharge processes. Fig. 2a shows CV curves of the Sb@G@C (650 °C) electrode at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. A peak located at 1.04 V could be seen during the initial cathodic scan which weakened or disappeared during the following cycles, which could be assigned to the formation of a SEI film on the surface of the electrode during the initial cycle.45 Two peaks located at 0.67 and 1.10 V could be observed in the anodic scans, which are associated with the depotassiation process of alloy phases.39 Moreover, the overlapped CV curves from the second cycle indicate that the Sb@G@C electrode possesses highly reversible electrochemical performance. Besides, the CV curves of the Sb@G@C (550 and 750 °C) electrode at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 are also provided in Fig. S6 and S7 (ESI†). In order to quantify the potassium storage capability of the Sb@G@C composite, galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles of the initial two cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1 are illustrated in Fig. 2b. Here, the charge/discharge processes are corresponding to the potassium de-alloying/alloying reactions, respectively. The Sb@G@C electrode still displays two obvious plateaus around 0.04 and 1.04 V, which are corresponding to the alloying reaction and are highly consistent with the CV curves of Fig. 2a. The PIBs deliver a high capacity of 628/476 mA h g−1 during the initial discharge/charge process, corresponding to an initial coulombic efficiency up to 75.8%, which is comparable to those of the previously reported anode materials. Besides, they could deliver a discharge/charge capacity of 568/474 mA h g−1 during the second cycle, indicating that the Sb@G@C electrode is highly reversible during the charge process. An electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test was further performed to illustrate the good cycling stability of the Sb@G@C (650 °C) electrode. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the Sb@G@C (650 °C) electrode in the initial, 5th, 10th, and 20th cycles. From the fresh cell to the 10th cycle, the Rct value of the Sb@G@C (650 °C) electrode decreases due to the formation of the stable SEI film. With further increase of the cycle number to 20 cycles, the Rct value almost remained the same with the 10th cycle, indicating that the SEI film is mainly formed during the initial 10 cycles and remained stable during the subsequent cycles.

(b) Charge/discharge profiles of the Sb@G@C (650 °C) electrode at a current rate of 100 mA g−1 between 3.0 and 0.01 V for the 1st and 2nd cycles. (c) Rate capacities of the Sb@G@C (650 °C) electrode at various current rates from 100 to 2000 mA g−1. (d) Cycling performances of Sb@G@C (650 °C), Sb@C, Sb@G and Sb electrodes at a current rate of 1000 mA g−1 after 5 cycles activated by 100 mA g−1. 

Fig. 2c presents the rate performance of the Sb@G@C (650 °C) electrode at various current densities from 100 to 2000 mA g−1. It is obvious that the Sb@G@C (650 °C) electrode delivers higher capacities than the other two materials (550 and 750 °C) at relatively high current rates. Even at a very high current rate of 2000 mA g−1, it can achieve a high capacity of ∼127 mA h g−1. As a comparison, the Sb@G@C (550 and 750 °C) electrodes deliver relatively low capacities of 76 and 117 mA h g−1 at 2000 mA g−1 as shown in Fig. S9 and S10 (ESI†).
Furthermore, a long cycle stability test of Sb@G@C (650 °C) at a high current density of 1000 mA g−1 was performed, as presented in Fig. 2d. Notably, a high reversible capacity of 160 mA h g−1 could be maintained even after 800 cycles, corresponding to a capacity retention of 72.3% (as far as we know, this is the longest cycle stability of an Sb-based electrode obtained for PIBs to date). The corresponding charge discharge profiles are presented in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The highly stable cycle performance of Sb@G@C is might be due to its unique structure, that is, antimony was confined by carbon. Typically, the graphene provided the transfer channel for electrons, further buffering the extreme volume change during the potassiation/depotassiation processes. And, the carbon coating layer could confine the Sb nanoparticles effectively and modify the surface structure, further preventing the pulverization of the electrode. In contrast, the carbon confined Sb (Sb@C) electrode exhibits rapid capacity decay, and it only delivers a relatively low reversible capacity of 70 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles. Moreover, the graphite confined Sb (Sb@G) electrode also exhibits an inferior capacity of 60 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles. However, the battery delivers the lowest capacity of 30 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles for bulk antimony powder. The rapid capacity fading of Sb@C, Sb@G or pure Sb likely accounts for their large volume expansion during the cycling process, leading to the pulverization of the electrode materials, and further resulting in rapid capacity decay. In addition, a cycle stability test of Sb@G@C (650 °C) at a low current density of 100 mA g−1 was performed (Fig. S12, ESI†).

Fig. 3a illustrates the proposed structural change of the traditional Sb electrode and the Sb@G@C electrode during the potassiation/depotassiation processes. It could be seen that the traditional Sb electrode usually suffered from the structure pulverization phenomenon, and this would lead to repeated SEI formation, a low coulombic efficiency and rapid capacity decay. By contrast, the structure of the Sb@G@C anode in this work could be well maintained during continuous charge/discharge processes, because the graphene and carbon coating layer could buffer the huge volume change of Sb and prevent the fracture of the Sb@G@C electrode during the potassiation/depotassiation processes.

In order to prove the stability of the electrode, 2032 type coin cells with Sb@G@C electrode after cycles were disassembled in the glove box. TEM and HRTEM were performed to investigate the morphology and the final state of Sb in the electrode at discharged or charged states. TEM images also display many tiny Sb particles embedded in the carbon (Fig. 3b and d), and it presents little change at discharged and charged states, indicating the highly stable feature of this electrode structure, which is responsible for its superior cycle stability. Meanwhile, HRTEM was used to further explore the final state of Sb nanoparticles in the Sb@G@C electrode (Fig. 3c and e). As shown in Fig. 3c, the obtained sample at the discharged state shows the characteristic spacing of 0.294 nm and 0.261 nm, corresponding to the (103) and (200) lattice planes of K3Sb, respectively, indicating that the Sb nanoparticles have been fully alloyed with potassium at the discharged state. While in the charged state (Fig. 3e), the obtained sample shows the characteristic spacing of 0.310 nm and 0.223 nm, corresponding to the (012) and (104) lattice planes of metallic Sb, demonstrating the high reversibility of Sb nanoparticles during the charge process. Besides, the morphologies of Sb@G@C at different charge/discharge states are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), and no significant difference was observed, further demonstrating its superior structure stability.
To further understand the enhanced cycling performance of the Sb@G@C electrode, the morphology after 100 cycles was examined. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3f and g, the Sb nanoparticles are still confined in the carbon, and such a highly stable structure accounts for its superior electrochemical performance.
In summary, Sb@G@C anode materials were facilely synthesized and investigated as anodes for potassium-ion batteries. The Sb nanoparticles are uniformly confined by the carbon layer. Such a favorable structure not only could prevent the self-aggregation of Sb particles effectively and buffer volume changes of Sb nanoparticles during charge/discharge processes, but also could enhance ion/electron transportation and redox reactions. This work may bring new guidance for developing high performance alloy-based anodes for PIBs, especially simultaneous enhancement of conductivity and buffer volume change by carbon.
