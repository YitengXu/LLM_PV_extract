    , Accepted 8th August 2018First published on 9th August 2018AbstractThe adsorption kinetics of CO2 was experimentally characterized in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). Unexpectedly, high desorption temperatures (640 K, 170 kJ mol−1) were seen. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest the stabilization mechanism: bicarbonate formation in the defected perovskite film due to CO2 and H2O coadsorption.
The so-called lead-halide organic–inorganic perovskites are currently much debated new materials for solar-to-electric power conversion, LASER, light emitting diodes, photodetectors, etc.1–5 Advantages of these new materials include low-cost solution-based fabrication, high power conversion efficiencies (>20%), direct band gaps, long charge carrier diffusion lengths, low carrier effective masses, high absorption coefficients, a wide range of light-absorption, and high extinction coefficients. However, problematic is the long-term material/device stability affected by an intrinsic thermal degradation4 and the sensitivity to ambient gases (moisture, CO2, etc.) of the perovskites.6 The stability of the material has already been studied in detail before,6–11 but mostly under ambient conditions (i.e. in air) or in solution, using optical spectroscopy and chemical engineering type experimental techniques. In this project, we study the effect of adsorbed CO2 and water using surface science techniques under UHV conditions combined with DFT calculations. CO2 and water are present in the ambient and therefore problematic for any real-world applications. Also, CO2 is in the focus of scientific attention due to its environmental impact and possible utilization as a feedstock for the chemical industry; both CO2 and H2O are standard probe molecules in surface science.12–17 High CO2 desorption temperatures, as high as 640 K, were seen on CH3NH3PbI3 polycrystalline thin film samples, indicative of very unusual kinetics and rare CO2 surface chemistry on the perovskite. Note that molecular physisorbed/chemisorbed CO2 usually desorbs well below about 300 K on basically any known planar surface (metals, metal oxides, sulphides, carbides, semiconductors, alloys, etc.);12–16 however, similarly high desorption temperatures have been reported for a porous MgO material.18 DFT calculations, conducted directly as a part of this project, revealed a subtle combination of chemical and morphological effects resulting in such a stable adsorption state of CO2. According to DFT, CO2 and H2O form adsorbed carbonic acid (H2CO3) or bicarbonate (HCO3−) which is trapped inside of a defected perovskite structure. CO2 adsorption on/in the perovskite leads to much smaller binding energies. In addition, CO2 adsorption destabilizes the perovskite to some extent. The results are scientifically interesting since carbonic acid/bicarbonate formation as a (sub)surface reaction is rather unusual for CO2 chemistry.
We used a typical ambient pressure solution-based procedure commonly described in the literature3,6 to fabricate polycrystalline perovskite thin films, namely drop casting (spin coating) of a precursor solution (which is 40 wt% methylammonium triiodo plumbate [CH3NH3]+[PbI3]− in dimethylformamide) on indium doped tin oxide (ITO) glass in a flow of dry N2. (This support also is often used in devices;7 for synthesis details see the ESI,† Fig. S1 and S2.) The simplicity of this fabrication process is the major advantage for applications in photovoltaics. The as-prepared samples were immediately transferred to a UHV chamber and/or placed into a N2 filled storage container. Samples transferred to UHV were degassed in UHV at temperatures up to 380 K. Higher degassing temperatures destroy the samples; ion sputtering for cleaning cannot be used on these thin film samples. Thus, sample cleaning is limited, but the UHV environment prevents further accidental adsorption of contaminations as well as allows for application of surface science measuring techniques. Data collected from numerous different films are shown since these samples easily decomposed or changed irreversibly during the course of our experiments. Only few UHV surface science studies have been so far conducted on lead-halide organic–inorganic perovskites mostly concerning the characterization of the material4,19 and thin film growth.20,21 Gas–surface interactions have apparently not been considered in any detail in UHV with surface science techniques.
Plane wave DFT calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) using projected augmented wave potentials and generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation functional including semiempirical pairwise corrections and spin–orbit coupling. The atomic models were represented by a cross-section of the orthorhombic perovskite with the (001) surface on top.22 The supercell consisted of 96 atoms composed of alternating stoichiometric sublayers of lead iodide and methylammonium iodide: 4* ((CH3NH3)2Pb2I6) = 4* (2(PbI2) + 2(CH3NH3)I) with periodic boundary conditions imposed in each direction and a 15 Å vacuum spacing layer normal to the surface (described as (CH3NH3)8Pb8I24). In addition, a defect structure was constructed by removing a surface CH3NH3+ cation and I− in the second PbI2 layer (described as (CH3NH3)7Pb8I23; see the ESI† for further details as well as the image of the atomic model below).
Numerous experimental techniques were used to characterize the samples. UV-Vis and surface thickness experiments were conducted at ambient pressure. In addition, XRD (X-ray diffraction), EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy), AES (Auger electron spectroscopy), and SEM (scanning electron microscopy) data were collected in vacuum to characterize the samples prior to the UHV kinetics experiments; see Fig. S3–S8 in the ESI.† The obtained results are consistent with the literature. Experimental binding energies, Ed, were determined from the thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) peak positions (with uncertainty of ±0.5 kJ mol−1) using the Redhead equation (see the ESI† for details). TDS is a standard kinetics technique used in surface science where the sample temperature is increased with time and simultaneously desorbing species are detected with a mass spectrometer inside of a UHV chamber. The as-prepared samples were analysed or samples that were at low temperatures pre-dosed with gases.

Fig. 1A shows the result of such a TDS experiment, i.e., depicted are the species desorbing from an as-prepared perovskite sample into UHV as a function of temperature. We recorded several different species m/z = 17, 15, 18 and 44 corresponding to NH3 (or OH from water), CH3, H2O and CO2 in the multi-mass TDS experiment. According to Fig. 1A, gas desorption and sample decomposition of a pristine sample in UHV start above 540 K with TDS peak maxima within 600–640 K. No desorption was detected below 500 K. In contrast, for experiments in ambient air, a decomposition temperature of 334 K was reported.23 The greater thermal stability in UHV is plausible since the decomposition is not only caused by thermal degradation, but also by interaction with adsorbates. The fact that the perovskite film and decomposition products mostly desorbed during the >700 K ramp is evident from the AES data collected after the TDS experiment (Fig. S8, ESI†). Various decomposition mechanisms are described in the literature including6,10 (1) CH3NH3PbI3 → PbI2 + CH3I + NH3 and (2) CH3NH3PbI3 → PbI2 + CH3NH2 + HI. Indeed, NH3 (ammonia) is detected in favour of the first mechanism (Fig. 1). In addition, CH3 (methyl) which is one of the mass fragments24 in CH3I (methyl iodide) and CH3NH2 (methylamine) is evident in our experiment (Fig. 1). More importantly, CO2 and water, originally adsorbed during the ambient pressure synthesis, desorbed. AES data consistent with adsorbed PbI2 were detected on surfaces (Fig. S8, ESI†) flashed to 600 K, beyond this also lead iodide desorbs leaving a clean ITO substrate behind. Therefore, our data would be consistent with mechanism (1).
 Fig. 1  (A) Multi-mass thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) of an as-prepared perovskite thin film sample; (B) TDS after a 2L dose of CO2 on a 2nd sample. 

Fig. 1B depicts multi-mass TDS data from a 2nd sample after the adsorption of 2L CO2 in UHV at ∼100 K. The TDS traces are very similar to the prior case. The lower desorption temperatures reflect a greater CO2 surface concentration after the additional CO2 dose e.g. due to repulsive lateral interactions. Variations in the shape of the scans may reflect variations in sample morphology. Note that CO2 seems to also destabilize thermally the perovskite film, judged by the CH3 desorption temperatures. On the bare perovskite film the onset of CH3 desorption is at 560 K (Fig. 1A), whereas for the CO2 dosed perovskite, desorption starts already at 400 K (Fig. 1B).
New and unexpected are the great desorption temperatures for CO2 and water. What causes the unusual CO2 and H2O desorption in huge amounts above 600 K?
Regarding what is known from the literature, the CO2 and H2O desorption temperatures are too high for physisorbed gases. For example, physisorbed water desorbs usually below 200 K;17,25–28 similarly typical CO2 physisorption binding energies are within 20–40 kJ mol−1 with desorption temperatures below 300 K (see e.g. Table 5 in ref. 13). Assuming molecular adsorption/desorption, the TDS peak temperatures of ∼640 K (Fig. 1) would correspond to a binding energy of 170 kJ mol−1 (using a pre-exponential of 1 × 1013 s−1, see the ESI†). Nearly the same binding energy is obtained for a 2nd order desorption process (using a pre-exponential of 1 × 1021 cm2 (mol−1 s−1), ref. 29). These are unusually high binding energies and desorption temperatures. It is impossible that water will adsorb/desorb molecularly at such high temperatures. The formation of hydroxyls or OH–H2O clusters and recombinative desorption of these could explain the greater desorption temperatures for water.17 Molecular CO2 binding even on metal oxides is much weaker.13 Formation of carbonate-like species13,30 and strong (polydentate) chemisorption would be the only adsorption/reaction pathway known from the literature that could lead to similarly high desorption temperatures. For example, on CaO carbon dioxide desorption up to 500 K was seen due to the formation of carbonates.31 Carbonates are usually formed in O2–CO2 coadsorption phases or on O-sites of metal oxides. The perovskite film does not directly provide oxygen adsorption sites nor dissociates CO2 for carbonate formation, but water is clearly coadsorbed (Fig. 1). CO2 stabilization by water is known to occur in rare cases,32,33 however, not to the extent seen here (CO2 desorbs at 200 K in coadsorption with water on a Pd surface via carboxylate (bent CO2−) formation).32 Bicarbonates form, if at all, usually in tiny amounts on surface defect sites.30 (One of the few known examples is CO2 + H2O coadsorption on a defected TiO2(110) surface, producing adsorbed HCO3− that desorbs as CO2 at 213 K.)30 Carbonate binding in a polydentate chemisorption geometry, where the adsorbate interacts simultaneously with multiple surface sites, would enhance binding strength and has been proposed for powder samples. (Indeed on ZrO2 powders decomposition temperatures of ∼500 K for polydentate carbonates were reported.)34 This geometry becomes more likely on inhomogeneous surfaces, consistent with the perovskite. Importantly, the perovskites do possess internal adsorption sites which also could result in higher desorption temperatures due to adsorption/desorption kinetics inside of the pores (Knudsen diffusion) or polydentate adsorption geometries. Diffusion is usually much faster than TDS temperature ramps, i.e., it unlikely affects the kinetics. Note that we did conduct various blind experiments which rule out CO2 desorption at high temperatures from the sample holder (see Fig. S9, ESI†). Given the huge binding energies, our hypothesis that several stabilization mechanisms are active simultaneously appears plausible which is quite unusual for CO2 surface chemistry. The porous structure makes surface/subsurface reactions plausible. DFT calculations conducted directly as a part of this project allowed for the identification of a possible mechanism.
Using DFT calculations, first, numerous surface adsorption sites for molecular CO2 adsorption were tested; none of which resulted in binding energies even close to the experimental value (Table 1 and Fig. S11, S12, ESI†). Next, adsorption of carbonic acid (H2CO3) and its coadsorption with water were considered. An increase in binding strength became evident due to multi-site interactions (polydentate adsorption) and H2CO3–H2O complex formation, but still the binding energy was much lower than the experimental value. Finally, H3O+ and HCO3− embedded in a defected perovskite structure resulted in good qualitative agreement of the experiment and the theory (Table 1). Indeed, DFT confirms that unusually large binding energies for CO2 are possible.

Quantitatively, Ed for molecular CO2 adsorption amounts to only 12 kJ mol−1, a value consistent with CO2 physisorption,13 but it is much smaller than the experimental value measured here. The binding energy increases to 53 kJ mol−1 for H2CO3 adsorbed on the surface. Adsorbed carbonic acid30 could form from water and CO2 co-adsorbed on the surface via CO2 + H2O → H2CO3. Water is clearly present on our perovskite sample made in ambient air (Fig. 1) and is typical for any real-world application.
The binding energy approximately doubles and reaches 121 kJ mol−1 when water is co-adsorbed along with H2CO3, see Fig. 2A. Thus, water would assist in forming carbonic acid in the first place which then further interacts with adsorbed water. This interaction gives rise to a van der Waals H2O–H2CO3 complex, which provides more binding sites to the surface, increasing Ed. As a result, Ed(H2O + H2CO3) is greater than Ed(H2O) + Ed(H2CO3), see Table 1. However, the binding energies of carbonic acid and its complex with water are still distinctly lower than the experimental values.
 Fig. 2  Perovskite model: (A) H2O–H2CO3 complex and (B) defect structure with embedded H3O+ and HCO3−. The box represents the simulation cell. Each cell contains a H2O–H2CO3 complex or H3O+–HCO3− ion pair. Additional species observed in panels (A) and (B) are due to visualization with periodic boundary conditions. The vacuum layers are not explicitly shown. For selected atoms, interatomic distances in Å are indicated. 
Therefore, we considered a defected perovskite structure consisting of a CH3NH3+ cation vacancy, as shown in Fig. 2B. Instead of forming a molecular carbonic acid–water complex adsorbed on the surface, bicarbonate and hydronium could form according to H2CO3 + H2O → HCO3− + H3O+. Here H3O+ and HCO3− replace the corresponding natural cation and anion of the intrinsic perovskite structure. H3O+ replaces CH3NH3+ and HCO3− replaces I−, conserving the crystal structure (Fig. 2B). Similar mechanisms are known in colloidal chemistry.35–37 In our calculations, this configuration gives the largest binding energy of 166 kJ mol−1 which is actually quite close to the experimental value of 170 kJ mol−1 (Table 1). (The calculated Ed is the low coverage limit. Therefore, it should be compared with the as-prepared samples).
This CO2 stabilization is caused by several factors. Because the perovskite crystal structure remains intact, the intrinsic ion attraction that forms the crystal in the first place is also conserved. The bicarbonate anion replaces iodine and coordinates with divalent lead in the same way as the iodine anion was originally coordinated. Such complexation has similarity to a stable compound namely dicarboxyoxylead or Pb(HCO3)2. Also, the hydronium cation substitutes the methylammonium cation. Therefore, it becomes stabilized by neighbouring iodine anions. In addition, the hydronium cation and bicarbonate anion experience electrostatic attraction to each other. The embedding of H3O+ and HCO3− in the crystal may be considered as a morphological stabilization, whereas the formation of HCO3− would be a chemical stabilization of CO2, as mentioned in the introduction. The entire process may be considered as a subsurface–surface reaction. (Note, however, that the active site for bicarbonate formation is just 4.5 Å below the outer surface layer formed by the I-atoms, see the image in the ESI.† Indeed, we describe a subsurface reaction and not a bulk or solid state type process.) All of these are quite unusual for CO2 chemistry.
The embedded HCO3− could indeed thermally decompose and desorb as gas phase CO2 according to HCO3−(embedded) → CO2(gas) + OH−(ads) which is indeed first order kinetics in the HCO3− (or CO2) concentration. Even a UHV chamber has a significant hydrogen gas residual background. Therefore, adsorbed or embedded hydroxyl could form again water according to OH−(ads) + H+(ads) → H2O(ads) → H2O(gas). Assuming that this reaction step is fast, water and CO2 would indeed desorb simultaneously, as detected experimentally. As a parallel reaction pathway, bicarbonates could form as H2CO3 → HCO3− + H+. The CO2/water induced defect structure that replaces CH3NH3+ and I− is consistent with the thermal destabilization of the perovskite by CO2 adsorption mentioned above.
CO2 desorption at temperatures as high as 640 K was seen on CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. This may be compared with granular MgO based mesoporous materials18 where desorption is seen at comparably high temperatures or with highly reactive CaO surfaces where CO2 desorbs only within 100–450 K.31 DFT calculations suggest the formation of a defect structure where H3O+ replaces CH3NH3+ and HCO3− replaces I− of the perovskite. As a part of the mechanism, bicarbonates and carbonic acid are formed as surface/subsurface reactions of CO2 with water. Although this is unusual CO2 surface chemistry, the effect of water and CO2 will regularly be encountered in technological applications of these perovskites.
