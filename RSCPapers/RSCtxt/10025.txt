    , Accepted 31st December 2015First published on 31st December 2015AbstractCH3NH3PbI3−xClx(MAPbI3−xClx) mixed halide perovskite powder with uniform composition was synthesized via simple solution chemistry, which demonstrates highly reproducible, efficient planar type MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cells. Pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite powder was synthesized by reacting a 3:1 molar ratio of MAI:PbCl2 powder mixture in isopropanol (IPA) solution for 30 min at 60 °C with subsequent repeated centrifugation and washing in IPA. IPA functions as both the reaction medium for the formation of MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide and a selective remover of unreacted MAI and MACl byproducts. Accordingly, we could deposit a pinhole-free dense MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film on a TiO2/FTO substrate through a simple one step spin-coating of pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite powder in DMF solution with HI additive, without further long heat-treatment processes. The deposited MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film revealed uniform composition throughout the entire area, and the ratio of Cl to I + Cl and I + Cl to Pb was constant at ∼0.03 and ∼1/3, respectively. On the other hand, the conventional MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film prepared by the long heat-treatment process had non-uniform composition because the ratio of Cl to I + Cl fluctuated greatly from 0 to 7.2. The average efficiency of planar type MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cells was 18.65% ± 0.30% and the champion cell had 1.11 V Voc, 22.1 mA cm−2Jsc, 77% F.F., and 18.9% η for forward scan conditions and 1.11 V Voc, 22.1 mA cm−2Jsc, 78% F.F., and 19.1% η for reverse scan conditions. Although the thickness of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite layer varied from ∼500 nm to ∼900 nm, the efficiency was within the range of 18.3%–19.0%.
Although solar cells are recognized as promising candidates to compensate for the electrical energy demand because they can directly convert the clean, abundant, and sustainable solar light energy into the most convenient and safe electrical energy, the power generation cost of the conventional crystalline Si solar cells is still more expensive than that of fossil fuel.
To date, solution processable organic photovoltaics (OPVs),1 thin-film solar cells (T-FSCs),2 dye-sensitized solar cells (D-SSCs),3 and quantum dot-solar cells (QD-SCs)4 have been intensively studied to develop more cost effective solar cells than the crystalline Si solar cells. Unfortunately, the cost effective solution processable solar cells with high efficiency among the abovementioned solar cells have not been reported because their power conversion efficiency is <13% under conditions of 1 sun, which is much lower than the efficiency of crystalline Si solar cells.
Recently, cost effective perovskite hybrid solar cells with high power conversion efficiency were reported, which can be fabricated by simple solution processes such as spin-coating, spray coating, slot die coating, and 3D printing, and their certified record efficiency reached over 20% at conditions of 1 sun.6k Since Kojima et al.5 reported the liquid junction perovskite-sensitized solar cells, to date efficient solid state mesoscopic,6 planar,7 and meso-superstructured8 perovskite hybrid solar cells have been developed. The high efficiencies of perovskite hybrid solar cells seem to be attributed to the unique material properties such as high absorption coefficient by direct bandgap, high open circuit voltage by small exciton binding energy, long diffusion length of charge carriers through the formation of shallow traps, and low temperature solution processability.
In general, the perovskite materials have a AMX3 crystal structure (A: monovalent metal cation or organoalkyl ammonium, M: divalent metal such as Pb, Sn, Ge, Cu, Mn, and Co, and X: halogen such as Cl, Br, and I). For solar cells, pure AMX3 (A: methyl ammonium or formamidinium, M: Pb, X: Br or I) perovskite or mixed halide AMX3−xYx (A: methyl ammonium and formamidinium, M: Pb, X: I, and Y: Br or Cl) perovskite materials are usually used. Pure CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (MAPbI3−xClx) mixed halide perovskite hybrid solar cells are known to have charge carrier diffusion lengths of ∼100 nm and ∼1000 nm, respectively.9 In terms of charge collection efficiency and reproducibility of device efficiency, according to the thickness deviation of the perovskite layer formed by the solution process, the mixed halide perovskite solar cells have greater benefit than of the pure perovskite solar cells. However, the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite material cannot be directly formed by a simple solution process but is obtained by the long thermal annealing processing (∼40 min) of a 3:1 molar mixture of MAI:PbCl2 and the subsequent elimination/sublimation of unreacted MAI and MACl byproduct,8a,10 whereas pure MAPbI3 perovskite materials can be directly formed by a simple drying process.7j,k Therefore, it is quite difficult to form uniform pinhole-free dense MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite thin films over large area via a single step solution process; however, the pure MAPbI3 perovskite can form a uniform dense thin film via a single step solution process. Therefore, it is quite challenging to form uniform dense MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite thin film over large area via single step solution process. Herein, we report the fabrication of uniform dense MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite thin films via a single step spin-coating process and highly reproducible planar MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite hybrid solar cells.
To eliminate the problematic long thermal annealing process for the formation of a MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite, we tried to synthesize it via simple solution chemistry. For a typical procedure, we manually mixed a 3:1 molar ratio of MAI:PbCl2 powder (3 g: 1.76 g) in a vial and poured 15 mL iso-propanol into the vial. The solution mixture was then magnetically stirred for 30 min at 60 °C for the chemical reaction of MAI and PbCl2. Note that the reaction can proceed at room temperature but to ensure/promote the reaction, we intentionally heated the solution to 60 °C. Initially, the solution mixture was turbid and gradually changed color to black. To separate the black precipitated powder from the solution, we centrifuged the solution for 10 min at 3000 rpm. The black powder was then dried in a vacuum oven for 5 h at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 1. Herein, it should be noted that iso-propanol (IPA) can selectively dissolve unreacted MAI and MACl byproducts formed by the long heat-treatment process, but it does not dissolve MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite. The IPA solvent therefore has dual function as (i) the reaction medium for the formation of MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite by the reaction of 3:1 molar ratio of MAI:PbCl2, and (ii) a selective remover of unreacted MAI and MACl byproducts. These byproducts are not uniformly removed/sublimated by the conventional, relatively long heat-treatment processing of the 3:1 molar ratio of MAI:PbCl2 film at 100 °C for ∼40 min, and this causes pin-holes or a rough surface due to the removed sections in the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide film. Accordingly, the overall reaction for the new process (1) and the conventional process (2) can be written as follows: 3MAI + PbCl2 + IPA ↔ MAPbI3−xClx (↓) + MAIx + MACl2−x + IPA − new process(1) 3MAI + PbCl2 ↔ MAPbI3−xClx + MAIx (↑) + MACl2−x (↑) − conventional process(2)
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the preparation of MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite powder by a solution reaction. 
To completely remove the undesirable MAI and MACl byproducts, we repeated both the washing of the precipitated powder with IPA and the centrifugation process. Fig. 2(a–f) show images of the product solution prepared by the repeated washing process and the dried powder. Apparently, the samples (a) and (b) showed a grey color indicating that the product is not a pure material, whereas samples (c–e) were black color. This implies that in order to obtain pure MAPbI3−xClx from the solution chemistry, at least 3 round washing and centrifugation process is required under the current experiment conditions. The optimal number of washings can be determined by checking the color of the solution along with XRD. Fig. 2(f) is a representative dried powder sample exhibiting a black color. It should be noted that the dried MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite powder is stable if stored in a desiccator, as shown in Fig. S1.†

To examine the composition of the materials produced by the solution reaction of a 3:1 molar ratio of MAI:PbCl2 in IPA solution at 60 °C for 30 min and the subsequent repeated washing process, we analysed the XRD (X-ray diffraction) patterns of the dried powders of samples (a–e), as shown in Fig. 2(g). To assign the XRD peaks, we measured XRD patterns of MAI, MACl, PbI2, and PbCl2 powders, as shown in Fig. S2.† The XRD patterns of samples (a) and (b) reveal the MACl and PbCl2 impurity peaks, which might be attributed to the incomplete removal of MACl by 1 or 2 rounds of washing and centrifugation process. In reaction eqn (1), once the MACl is efficiently removed by the repeated washing and centrifugation process, the forward reaction is promoted by Le Chatelier's principle so that the formation of pure MAPbI3−xClx is promoted. The XRD pattern of sample (c) shows that the pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite was formed by a 3 round repeated washing and centrifugation process. The XRD patterns of samples (d) and (e) showed MAI and PbI2 impurity peaks, which might be formed by the partial decomposition of MAPbI3−xClx into MAI and PbI2 due to the interaction between MAI and IPA because MAI is soluble in IPA. This reverse decomposition reaction was confirmed by the fact that the yellow PbI2 was precipitated by the partial decomposition reaction when we placed the pure MAPbI3 powder in IPA solution. The XRD results were consistent with the colors of the prepared solutions in Fig. 2(a–e). Accordingly, we could prepare the pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite powder by solution reaction chemistry and a subsequent 3 round repeated washing and centrifugation process.
In general, the conventional MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film prepared by the long heat-treatment process of 3:1 MAI:PbCl2 film has non-uniform composition due to the non-uniform solid–solid reaction between MAI and PbCl2 and elimination/sublimation of unreacted MAI and/or MACl byproduct during the heat-treatment process, as shown in Fig. S3.† The EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) spectra of 9 points on the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film prepared by the conventional heat-treatment process at 100 °C for 40 min under air showed that the ratio of Cl to I + Cl in the film fluctuated significantly from 0% to 7.2%. The significant fluctuation of the composition of the film might be associated with the fact that some parts were fully converted into pure MAPbI3 by the complete replacement of Cl in PbCl2 with I by MAI, and incomplete reaction occurred in some parts. Fig. 2(h) is an image of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film deposited on a glass substrate by spin-coating 40 wt% powder sample (c) in DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) solution with HI additive (1 mL DMF solution/0.1 mL HI aqueous solution) at 500 rpm for 200 s under air conditions and subsequent drying at 100 °C for 2 min. During the spin-coating process, the excess MAPbI3−xClx/DMF/HI solution on the TiO2/FTO substrate was spun out and wet MAPbI3−xClx film was formed. The wet film was then solidified to form a crystalline MAPbI3−xClx layer by further solvent evaporation. The initiation of the crystallization process of the MAPbI3−xClx layer is dependent on the solubility of the MAPbI3−xClx solution. The MAPbI3−xClx solution with higher solubility begins to crystallize from a more concentrated solution and thereby, the surface coverage of the MAPbI3−xClx layer is improved by using the solution with higher solubility.7d Accordingly, the pinhole-free MAPbI3−xClx layer can be formed by using the MAPbI3−xClx/DMF/HI solution via a single step spin-coating process. The EDS spectra of 9 points marked as X in the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film clearly confirm that the composition ratio of Cl to Cl + I is constant to ∼3% and the ratio of Pb to Cl + I is also constant to ∼1/3, as shown in Fig. 2(i). To again confirm the composition of MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film, we obtained XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) spectra of 5 points, as shown in Fig. S4.† The measured composition ratio of Cl to Cl + I was ∼3% (same result as EDS analysis) and the ratio of Pb to Cl + I was ∼1/3. It should be noted that this is the first demonstration of the synthesis of a MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film with uniform composition.
To check the photovoltaic properties of MAPbI3−xClx (x = ∼0.03) mixed halide perovskite material with uniform composition, we fabricated a planar type MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite hybrid solar cell composed of FTO (F-doped tin oxide)/TiO2/MAPbI3−xClx/PTAA (polytriarylamine) with Li-TFSI (Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) and t-BP (tert-butyl pyridine/Au, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) is a schematic band energy diagram of a planar type MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite hybrid solar cell, indicating that the generated electrons (holes) in MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite can be efficiently transferred/transported to the TiO2 electron conductor (PTAA hole conductor). In Fig. 3(b), a SEM (scanning electron microscopy) top surface image of MAPbI3−xClx film deposited on the TiO2/FTO substrate shows that the surface is very smooth and apparently grain boundaries are not observed. Fig. 3(c) is a SEM cross-sectional image of the planar MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cell, indicating that the thicknesses of the dense TiO2 electron conductor, MAPbI3−xClx, PTAA, and Au are ∼50 nm, ∼900 nm, ∼30 nm, and ∼60 nm, respectively. Fig. 3(d) is an EQE (external quantum efficiency) spectrum of a planar MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cell showing that the EQE value is over 80% in the entire visible region, and the maximum value reaches ∼90%. The calculated short circuit current density (Jsc) from the integration of the EQE spectrum is ∼22 mA cm−2. Fig. 3(e) shows photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the planar MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cell with respect to the forward and reverse scan directions under illumination of 1 sun (100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G). The champion planar MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cell exhibited 1.11 V open circuit voltage (Voc), 22.1 mA cm−2 short circuit current density (Jsc), 77% fill factor (F.F.), and 18.9% overall power conversion efficiency (η) for forward scan conditions, and 1.11 V Voc, 22.1 mA cm−2Jsc, 78% F.F., and 19.1% η for reverse scan conditions. The steady-state efficiency of the champion planar MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cell is shown in Fig. S5.† This confirms that the steady-state efficiency is maintained under continuous light soaking of 1 sun. Herein, it should be noted that the pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite planar type solar cells did not have significant J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction due to the removal of impurities such as MAI, MACl, and PbCl2 by the solution reaction and washing processes. The J–V curves of the 1 round washed sample in Fig. S6(a)† show significant J–V hysteresis and poor device efficiency due to the significant amount of impurities. The J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction gradually reduced for the 3 times washing sample and then was further deteriorated for the samples with over 3 times washing, as shown in Fig. S6.† The photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table S1.† The tendency of J–V hysteresis well matched with the results of XRD data in Fig. 2(g). The J–V hysteresis of the pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite planar type solar cell with respect to the delay time (scan rate = 10 mV per delay time) in Fig. 3(f) shows that the device efficiencies measured under forward and reverse scan conditions coincide at delay times greater than 0.2 s. The average efficiency and deviation of 30 samples were 18.65% ± 0.30%, as shown in Fig. 3(g) (see the statistical data in Table S2†). It should be noted that there were no failed samples and the efficiency deviation is small because the planar type MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cells still worked well even though the thickness of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite layer was ∼2 times thicker than the pure MAPbI3 perovskite layer due to a much longer charge carrier diffusion length.9 The charge carrier diffusion coefficients (Dn) and charge carrier life times (τn) of pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite planar type solar cells were calculated from IMPS (intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy) and IMVS (intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy) analysis, as shown in Fig. 3(h) and (i). Accordingly, the diffusion length (Ln = (Dn·τn)0.5) of the pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite planar type solar cell was ∼1100 nm, which is comparable to the previously reported value.9

Finally, we checked the efficiency variation of the pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite planar type solar cells with respect to the thickness of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite layer in order to confirm high reproducibility and narrow efficiency deviation, as shown in Fig. 4. The photovoltaic properties of the pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite planar type solar cells, depending on the thickness of the active layer, are summarized in Table 1. To control the thickness of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite layer, we adjusted the rpm of spin-coating to 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, and 3000 rpm, which resulted in thicknesses of ∼900, ∼800, ∼700, ∼500, ∼400, and 150–200 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4(a–f). From the J–V curves in Fig. 4(g) for forward scan conditions and (h) for reverse scan conditions and the photovoltaic properties in Table 1, it can be seen that the Jsc was saturated to ∼22 mA cm−2; therefore, we can assume that the ∼500 nm-thick MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite layer is sufficient to fully absorb light. When the thickness of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite layer was varied from ∼500 nm to ∼900 nm, the efficiency varied from ∼18.3% to ∼19.0%. The constant efficiency and small efficiency deviation are attributed to the long charge carrier diffusion length (Ln) of ∼1100 nm, which enables the ∼900 nm-thick sample to still have good charge collection efficiency.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully synthesized a pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite powder via simple solution chemistry and demonstrated highly reproducible, efficient planar type MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cells. To synthesize MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite powder, we reacted a 3:1 molar ratio of MAI:PbCl2 powder mixture in IPA solution for 30 min at 60 °C. We then repeated the centrifugation and washing process in 1 to 5 cycles. The 1 and 2 round repeated centrifugation and washing processes yielded the formation of MACl and PbCl2 due to incomplete reaction, and 3 rounds of repeated centrifugation and washing produced a pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite powder. Over 4 rounds of repeated centrifugation and washing formed MAI and PbI2 impurities due to the partial decomposition of MAPbI3−xClx. Through the simple one step spin-coating of pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite powder in DMF solution with HI additive, we deposited a pinhole-free, dense MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film on a TiO2/FTO substrate without a further long heat-treatment process. The deposited MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film revealed uniform composition throughout the entire area, and the ratio of Cl to I + Cl and I + Cl to Pb was constant at ∼0.03 and ∼1/3, respectively. On the other hand, the conventional MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite film prepared by a long heat-treatment process had non-uniform composition because the ratio of Cl to I + Cl fluctuated greatly from 0 to 7.2, due to non-uniform solid–solid phase reaction and incomplete elimination/sublimation of unreacted MAI and MACl byproducts. The average efficiency of planar type MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cells was 18.65% ± 0.30%, and the champion cell had 1.11 V Voc, 22.1 mA cm−2Jsc, 77% F.F. and 18.9% η for forward scan conditions, and 1.11 V Voc, 22.1 mA cm−2Jsc, 78% F.F. and 19.1% η for reverse scan conditions. Therefore, the pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide planar type perovskite solar cells did not show significant J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction. Even though the thickness of the MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite layer varied from ∼500 nm to ∼900 nm, the efficiency varied only slightly from ∼18.3% to ∼19.0%; therefore, we could reproducibly fabricate highly efficient planar MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite solar cells with narrow efficiency deviation. We believe that this pure MAPbI3−xClx mixed halide perovskite material will benefit the fabrication of a large area submodule with high reproducibility via a simple solution coating process such as spray coating and bar coating.
