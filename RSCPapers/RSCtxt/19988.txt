    , Accepted 5th March 2012First published on 5th March 2012AbstractWe report the synthesis of peripherally alkylated dithienosilole (DTS) and dithienogermole (DTG) monomers that possess side chains of different lengths (methyl vs. butyl) attached to a bridging heavy atom (Si or Ge) and the resulting copolymers with benzothiadiazole (BT) units. We study the optoelectronic and charge transport properties of these copolymers, with a particular focus on their use for bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices in blends with phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM). Enhanced charge carrier mobility is observed by substituting Si atom with Ge atom and better mixing of copolymers with PC70BM desirable for better charge generation is obtained by shortening the side chain length of copolymers from butyl to methyl groups. We observe a very high open circuit voltage (Voc = ∼0.94 V) in single layer blend devices (polymer:PC70BM = 1:4 by weight in DCB) with good device performance (PCE = 2.66%, Jsc = 6.11 mA cm−2, FF = 0.46) using Ge substituted copolymers with methyl side groups. Neither additional pre- or post-thermal annealing steps nor additives to the photoactive blend layer are needed to achieve such device performance. Based on detailed investigation including absorption, emission, charge carrier mobility and quantum chemical calculations for molecular geometry and electronic energy levels, we clarify the role of the heavy atom substitution in the donor–acceptor bridged copolymers and discuss their effects on device performance in bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells have received great attention over the past decade1–4 due to their potential advantages such as low cost, flexibility and easy fabrication. In particular, in an effort to increase device efficiencies, there has been an intensive world-wide effort towards the synthesis of new conjugated polymers that can absorb more of the solar spectrum. To increase the device performance, the management of individual processes in light absorption, charge transport, charge separation and collection should be efficiently controlled. Many different types of candidate materials have been developed to achieve high performance.5,6 Some of the best performing low band gap polymers to date have utilized the so called donor–acceptor approach, whereby electron rich donor monomers are with electron poor acceptor monomers. The resulting polymers show hybridisation of the molecular orbitals, with the LUMO being dominated by the electron accepting unit and the HOMO by the donor material resulting in narrowing of the optical band gap.
One area of active research has been the study of the effect of the bridging atom in low band gap polymers containing fused ring systems. For example, by replacing the carbon bridging atom in fluorene containing polymers with silicon (Si), Yong Cao and co-workers reported polymers of silafluorene with thiophene–benzothiadiazole–thiophene, which was one of the first low band gap polymers to afford device efficiencies above 5%.7 In comparison to the carbon substituted polymer, the inclusion of silicon as the bridging atom resulted in a reduction in the optical band gap, an increase in hole carrier mobility and an increase in polymer ionization potential and hence device open circuit voltage. The changes in electronic properties are related to both the interaction of the low lying σ* orbitals of the Si atom with the π* orbitals of the conjugated main backbone of the polymer which can have a stabilizing effect on LUMO energy level, as well as to the lengthening of the C–Si bond in comparison to the C–C bond.8–13 In bridged aromatics this can have the effect of increasing the distance between adjacent sp2 hybridized carbon atoms and therefore reducing the strength of interaction between them.
Another interesting example is the comparison between poly[(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b′] dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl] (PCPDTBT),14,15 and poly{[4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b;2′,3′-d]silole]-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothidiazole)-4,7-diyl} (PSBTBT) which was successfully used to fabricate highly efficient OPV devices with a power conversion efficiency of ∼6% when blended with PC70BM. Such device efficiencies were achieved by manipulation of the blend morphology using solvent additives such as octane-1,8-dithiol or diiodooctane,16,17 which increased efficiency from 3.1% for the simple blend. Recently, it has been shown that the alteration of the carbon bridging atom with Si can affect the crystallinity and packing of the polymer backbone.8,18
Despite the promising results for silicon substitution, there has been very little work attempting to replace the carbon bridging atom in fluorene containing polymers with other heavy atoms such as germanium (Ge). Only recently, Leclerc reported the synthesis of germanium bridged fluorene analogues, germafluorenes, and the first polymers incorporating these materials.19 Reynolds and So et al. have reported a low band gap polymer by polymerization of alkylated dithienogermole (DTG) with N-octylthieno pyrrolodione (TPD), which produces device efficiency above 7% in blends with PC70BM.20 In addition, both ourselves,21 Ohshita et al.23 and Leclerc et al.24 have reported independently copolymers of DTG and benzothiadiazole (BT), with solar cell efficiencies up to ∼5%.
In these recent reports DTG was substituted with long chain branched alkyl groups (2-ethylhexyl) on the bridging germanium heterocycle. This introduced some synthetic challenges because the required dichlorobis(2-ethylhexyl) germane is not commercially available and its synthesis is rather cumbersome and low yielding. In this work we introduce a different strategy to afford soluble polymer materials. Rather than include the long chain solubilising groups on the bridging heteroatom, we instead move them onto adjacent thiophene rings in 3,3′ positions (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of the polymers studied in this work. 
This now enables us to utilize commercially available dialkyl germanium and silicon dichlorides to readily introduce the silyl and germyl groups. In addition, we can vary the alkyl group on the heteroatom as a second tool to potentially control molecular packing and polymer solubility. Such a strategy allows us to systematically investigate the electronic and morphological effects of the heteroatom. In this study we investigate both methyl and more sterically bulky butyl groups on the heteroatom. We synthesized four kinds of new materials (Scheme 1), in which the dithienometalloles were copolymerized with the electron accepting benzothiadiazole monomer. The synthesis routes to the four kinds of polymers (MeGeBT:poly[(3,3′-bis(dodecyl)-4,4′-dimethyldithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]germole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl], BuGeBT:poly[(3,3′-bis(dodecyl)-4,4′-di-n-butyldithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]germole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl]), MeSiBT:poly[(3,3′-bis(dodecyl)-4,4′-dimethyldithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl], and BuSiBT:[(3,3′-bis(dodecyl)-4,4′-di-n-butyldithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl]) are shown in Scheme 2. MeGeBT, BuGeBT and BuSiBT were readily synthesized by the environmentally friendly Suzuki polycondensation method with the monomers 1, 2, 3 and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester), respectively. However, MeSiBT could not be prepared by the same methodology due to the decomposition of dithienosilole ring under the basic conditions of the Suzuki reaction. Presumably the reduced steric hindrance of the dimethyl group compared to the butyl group facilitates the nucleophilic attack of the base on the silyl group. We note that the dimethylgermyl group was stable under these conditions, further demonstrating the enhanced stability of dithienogermoles over dithienosiloles to the basic conditions of Suzuki polymerisation.21 Therefore MeSiBT was synthesized by the Stille cross-coupling under neutral conditions. The trimethylstannyl derivative of dithienosilole was prepared by lithiation with n-BuLi and reaction of the resulting dianion with trimethyltin chloride. Subsequent polymerisation with 4,7-dibromobenzothiadiazole afforded MeSiBT.

Here we investigate the optoelectronic, charge transport, and morphological properties of these four copolymers, with a particular focus on their use for bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices in blends with phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM). The chemical and optical properties of these four copolymers in terms of molecular weights (Mn and Mw), polydispersity, maximum absorption peak position and optical bandgap are listed in Table 1.

Experimental
Monomers 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Scheme 2 were prepared according to the published procedures.22 Procedures for the preparation of monomer 5 and all polymers (MeGeBT, BuGeBT, MeSiBT and BuSiBT) are described as follows.
Synthesis and characterization
Reagents and chemicals were purchased from Aldrich, Acros or Fluorochem. All reactions were carried out under Ar using solvents and reagents as commercially supplied, unless otherwise stated. Commercial 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-bis(boronic acid pinacol ester) and 4,7-dibromobenzothiadiazole was purified by chromatography over silica gel, followed by recrystallisation from hexane before use. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 (400 MHz), using the residual solvent resonance of CDCl3 or TMS as an internal reference and are given in ppm (ESI†). Number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) were determined by Agilent Technologies 1200 series GPC running in chlorobenzene at 80 °C, using two PL mixed B columns in series, and calibrated against narrow polydispersity polystyrene standards. Microwave experiments were performed in a Biotage initiator V 2.3. Photo Electron Spectroscopy in Air (PESA) measurements were recorded with a Riken Keiki AC-2 PESA spectrometer with a power setting of 5 nW and a power number of 0.5. Samples for PESA were prepared on glass substrate as spin-coating films.
Synthesis of monomer 5
A solution of n-BuLi (2.3 mL of a 2.5 M solution in hexanes, 5.75 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of monomer 4 (1.66 g, 2.32 mmol) in THF (20 mL) at −78 °C. After stirring for 20 min at −78 °C, a 1 M solution of trimethyltin chloride (1.78 g, 3.9 mmol) was added. The cooling bath was removed and the reactant was allowed to warm to RT, followed by stirring for 0.5 h at RT. Water (30 mL) was added, and the mixture extracted (3 × 30 mL hexane). The combined organics were dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure.

Device fabrication and characterization
PC70BM was purchased from Nano-C and used as received. OPV devices were fabricated onto the indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates. After sequential cleaning of the ITO with the detergent (Mucasol), acetone and isopropyl alcohol, the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy thiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P TP AI 4083, Bayer AG) was spin coated to form a layer with a thickness of 30 nm and baked at 120 °C for 30 min. Polymer:PC70BM blended solution at a ratio of 1:4 by weight in dichlorobenzene (DCB) was spin coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrate. Devices were completed by thermally evaporating Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) electrode on top of the blend layer. Hole-only devices were fabricated using the PEDOT:PSS and Au electrodes. Electrical characteristics were measured using Keithley 236 source/measure units in the dark and under AM 1.5 solar illumination (Oriel 300 W solar simulator) at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. We also measured the external quantum efficiency as a function of excitation wavelength with a photomodulation spectroscopic setup. All electrical measurements of OPVs were carried out in an inert N2 purged glove box. UV-Visible absorption spectra were measured using a UV-Vis absorption spectro-photometer (UV 2500, Shimadzu). The thin film morphologies were characterized using the tapping mode atomic force microscope (DI, Nanoscope VI).
Results and discussion
We study the optoelectronic and charge transport properties of MeGeBT, MeSiBT, BuGeBT and BuSiBT copolymers, with a particular focus on their use for bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices in blends with PC70BM.
First, we measured the UV-Visible absorption spectra of four copolymers (Fig. 1a) and their blended films with PC70BM (Fig. 1b). In the homopolymer films, the main absorption peaks appear at 260, 330, 380 and 530 nm with the lowest energy band edge at ∼700 nm for all polymers, with a slight red-shift of the band edge (∼20 nm) from BuSiBT to MeGeBT (MeGeBT (∼701 nm) > MeSiBT (∼687 nm) > BuGeBT (∼684 nm) > BuSiBT (∼680 nm)). For the blend films (polymer:PC70BM = 1:4 by weight), the absorption spectra are a simple combination of each homopolymer and PC70BM, exhibiting the absorption feature at 475 nm originating from PC70BM with the same trend of red shift depending on the substituted heavy atom elements and side chain length.

Second, the performances of solar cell devices composed of these four copolymers were investigated by various processing conditions while blending with PC70BM. The photocurrent density versus applied voltage (J–V) characteristics of blend devices are shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d) and summarized in Table 2. A summary of OPV device parameters obtained during detailed device optimization and fabrication procedures is also shown in the ESI†. The performance of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/polymer:PC70BM (80 nm)/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm) blend devices were investigated with different blend composition ratio, solvents, additives and post-thermal treatments. All devices were measured under 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2) of simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation in a N2 purged chamber.

Among various devices, the best photovoltaic performance was achieved from the MeGeBT:PC70BM blend devices (1:4 by weight), which show Voc = 0.94 V, Jsc = 6.11 mA cm−2, FF = 0.46, with an overall PCE of 2.66%. For all polymers, significantly high Voc values (0.94 V) are obtained in blend devices, varying from 0.81 V for BuSiBT to 0.94 V for MeSiBT and from 0.90 V for BuGeBT to 0.94 V for MeGeBT; i.e. 0.09 V increase in Voc by the substitution of Si to Ge with butyl side groups (negligible change for methyl cases) and 0.13 V increase in Voc by replacing butyl to methyl side groups for Si based polymers (only 0.04 V increase for Ge based polymers). Such high Voc values can be understood based on the deep HOMO energy levels of these polymers (5.53–5.64 eV) (Table 1), which lead to a large energy offset between the polymer HOMO level and the PC70BM LUMO level (3.7 eV).25,26
In contrast, the short circuit current densities (Jsc) have significantly different values depending on the substituted moiety and side chains present in the polymers. The main difference in device performance among these blend devices came mainly from such changes in current density. We measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) as a function of excitation wavelength in the blend devices (Fig. 1e). The methyl side group containing polymer devices (MeGeBT and MeSiBT) have much higher EQE values than devices with butyl side group polymers. The maximum EQE values are observed at shorter excitation wavelengths (∼410 nm), which are 25–27% for butyl and 40–45% for methyl groups. The total photocurrent Jsc in these blend devices is measured as MeGeBT (6.11 mA cm−2) > MeSiBT (4.29 mA cm−2) > BuGeBT (3.71 mA cm−2) > BuSiBT (2.03 mA cm−2), showing higher Jsc in the methyl side group containing polymer devices. Regardless of different side groups, the heavy atom substitution from Si to Ge seems to cause a slight increase in EQE values at longer excitation wavelengths (>400 nm). This increase in EQE, even though it is small (∼5%), can induce the better spectral overlap with solar emission in longer wavelengths, contributing to an increase in the total Jsc measured under AM 1.5 excitation conditions. Note that the light intensity near the UV region (<400 nm) of the solar irradiance is relatively weak compared to the visible and infrared regions, so that the net contribution induced by the EQE changes in short excitation wavelengths to the total Jsc is expected to be much smaller.27
Third, we used the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method to evaluate the charge carrier mobility of holes in hole-only devices fabricated with ∼80 nm thick polymer:PC70BM blend films. Dark current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC70BM blend/Au devices were measured (Fig. 1f). The hole mobility values extracted using the modified Mott–Gurney equation27,28 are summarized in Table 3. The trend observed in hole mobilities in these blend devices; i.e.MeGeBT, (2.52 ± 0.05) × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 > MeSiBT, (2.44 ± 0.01) × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 > BuGeBT, (2.14 ± 0.03) × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 > BuSiBT, (1.86 ± 0.1) × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, is well matched with the trend found in the total Jsc values in blend devices. Note that although the changes in hole mobility values extracted from the measured JV curves of blend devices are minute, they are very reproducible. A similar trend in hole mobilities is also observed in thin film transistors (TFT) fabricated with homopolymers (ESI†). In the annealed homopolymer TFT devices, the average saturation hole mobility is measured to be MeGeBT (69.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) > MeSiBT (17.7 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) > BuGeBT (8.57 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) > BuSiBT (0.57 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1). The overall hole mobility values of these homopolymers and in particular of their blend films are very low in the order of 10−6 cm2 V s−1. Such low hole mobilities can result from large torsion angles induced between the donor and acceptor units in these polymers, as suggested by our QC calculation (see below), which might produce non-ideal polymer packing structures in thin films for good hole transport. Interestingly, there is still a clear trend in the hole mobility values, showing higher mobilities for shorter methyl side chain polymers. This clearly indicates the important role of side chain lengths of these polymers to determine solid state polymer packing and hence blend thin film morphology (see below) that strongly affect charge transport properties of devices. Therefore, we consider that the changes observed in total Jsc values for blend devices may result not only from the differences in optical responses but also from the differences in hole mobility of each homopolymer.

Fourth, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to characterize the effects of heavy atom substitution and side chain length variation on blend thin film morphology. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the topographic images of the blend films composed of MeGeBT and MeSiBT mixed with PC70BM exhibit well-mixed and smooth surfaces without any noticeable features, indicating good dispersion of PC70BM molecules in the polymer matrix. Regardless of Si and Ge substitution, when methyl side chains are incorporated into the polymer units, the polymers seem to be finely mixing with PC70BM molecules. The same smooth and homogeneous thin film morphology is also observed in these blend films when deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. Such finely mixed polymer:PC70BM blend systems are expected to enhance exciton dissociation and thus charge carrier generation in OPV devices.

On the other hand, for the blend films fabricated with butyl side chain polymers, distinctively phase-separated domain structures with an average domain size of 200–300 nm are observed. In these films, the blend composition ratio between the polymer and PC70BM is 1:4 by weight, so these large phase-separated domain features which cover most of the film surfaces are expected to be PC70BM-rich or PCBM aggregates. In general, when donor and acceptor bridged polymers are blended with fullerene molecules, the severe phase separation between the two components occurs. To reduce the degree of such phase separation, different additives such as diiodooctane (DIO) or octanedithiol (OT) have been often mixed with the blend solutions.16,17 Since these additives can act as a selective solvent for PC70BM molecules, the formation of large aggregated domains of PC70BM molecules can be prevented, leading to more desirable bulk heterojunction thin film structures. Some of the polymers (MeGeBT and MeSiBT) studied here, however, show already well mixed thin film morphology when blended with PC70BM, even without any additives.
By comparing MeGeBT and MeSiBT blend films with BuGeBT and BuSiBT blend films, we consider the effect of side group length (methyl vs. butyl) in these polymers, which influences their molecular packing when blended with PC70BM molecules. If the side chain (R) length on the bridging heteroatom in the polymer is too long (e.g. butyl case), PC70BM molecules may not be able to penetrate well between the two dithiophene units in the polymer, which already possess two long C12 side chains (see Scheme 1). In contrast, if the side chain (R) length in the cyclopentane is short enough (e.g. methyl case), then PC70BM molecules can now be able to penetrate between the two dithiophene units and be better mixed leading to no measurable phase-separated domain structures between them. Note that excessively large PC70BM domains observed in BuGeBT and BuSiBT blend films can be responsible for reduced device efficiencies, in particular for significant lower Jsc values observed (∼40 to 50% lower than Me-based devices) possibly due to significantly reduced exciton dissociation and thus charge carrier generation in these large domains.
Finally, quantum chemical calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP level with a basis set of 6-31G(d) (Gaussian09 package)7–9 in order to study molecular geometry and frontier electronic energy levels of the polymers (MeGeBT, MeSiBT, BuGeBT and BuSiBT) (Fig. 3). The molecular geometry was first optimized, from which the frontier molecular orbital (MO) surfaces were generated and parameters such as bond length or torsion angle were extracted. The calculated C–Ge bond length is slightly longer than that of C–Si bond (1.95 Å vs. 1.89 Å respectively), which produces a similar trend to the increase in calculated bond length for Si substituted polymers (1.89 Å vs. 1.53 Å for C–Si and for C–C respectively),8 even though the increase is much smaller. An increase in the bond length is often considered to be important for better packing of Si substituted polymers due to resultant reduction in steric hindrance between the solubilising alkyl groups and the thiophene rings. A similar effect due to the increased bond length in Ge substituted polymers can be expected; however this effect will be relatively minor compared to the Si substituted case. The torsion angle between donor and acceptor units in each polymer is very similar showing less than 1 degree difference (Fig. 3a). This indicates no significant differences in the polymer backbone planarity with the substitution of a heavy atom from Si to Ge with methyl or butyl side groups attached. As shown in Fig. 3a and S1 (ESI†), the calculated torsion angles between donor and acceptor units are around 50 degrees. These high torsion angles may hinder the effective packing between neighbouring polymer chains, introducing disordered amorphous nature of these polymers. The expected amorphous nature of these polymers is confirmed by XRD measurement (Fig. S2†) where no measurable crystalline packing peaks are observed. Note that such twisted polymer backbone structure of these polymers can be responsible for their poor hole transport properties, as discussed earlier.

(b) LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the molecules calculated using the Gaussian09 package; density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP level of theory with a basis set of 6-31G(d); the size and color of the shapes describe the amplitude and sign of the LCAO (linear combination of atomic orbitals) coefficients associated with the atomic π-orbitals. 
We consider that the longer C–Ge bond length in Ge-substituted polymers in particular those with shorter methyl side groups (MeGeBT) can be most beneficial for better molecular packing between polymer chains (producing the highest hole mobility in homopolymer films) and between polymers and PCBM molecules (producing the highest Jsc in blend films). For the blend films, it can allow effective penetration of PCBM molecules into polymer matrix, leading to well mixed blend thin film morphology (see Fig. 2a).29 This finely mixed packing structure between polymers and PCBM molecules in blends does not seem to jeopardize good hole transport properties of Ge-substituted polymers (Table 3).
We also checked the stiffness difference between Ge and Si substituted polymers with the calculation of potential energy curves as a function of torsion angle between donor and acceptor units (Fig. S3†). We found no significant difference between the potential energy curves of the two molecules. Both the Si and Ge molecules show similar torsion angles (∼50 degrees) with similar stiffness, i.e. the curvatures of energy–angle plots for both polymers are almost identical. This supports the idea that Ge atom substitution itself does not affect the chain planarity or torsional stiffness; the only obvious difference is the bond length between C–Ge and C–Si that might influence the polymer backbone planarity and local packing structure while blended with PC70BM molecules.30

Fig. 3b shows the calculated molecular orbital surfaces at the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of all polymers. All polymers have very similar frontier orbital energy levels; the LUMO is strongly localised on the BT unit and the HOMO is well delocalised along the main conjugated backbone of the polymers. Note that there is no inclusion of the substituted molecules (Si and Ge) in either HOMO or LUMO level, indicating that the frontier energy levels are not strongly affected by the heavier atom substitution in these materials (−5.14 to −5.15 eV HOMO level calculated for all polymers). This is in good agreement with the experimental data, such as absorption and ionization potentials (Fig. 1a and Table 1), showing no significant differences in the electronic energy levels and optical band gaps by substitution of Si with Ge and methyl with butyl side groups.
Conclusions
In conclusion, new copolymers containing Si- and Ge-bridged atoms were synthesized with different side chain lengths (methyl and butyl). We studied the optoelectronic and charge transport properties of these new copolymers, focusing on their effects on bulk heterojunction photovoltaic device performances when blended with PC70BM. For Ge-containing copolymers with methyl side groups, high Voc values (up to 0.94 V) were measured in single layer blend OPV devices with relatively high Jsc values (6.11 mA cm−2). Such high Jsc values observed in MeGeBT:PC70BM devices were attributed to slightly red-shifted light absorption and higher hole mobility of the Ge-containing polymers. Furthermore, we observed distinctively different thin film morphology in blends by changing the side chain length of the donor moiety in these copolymers. With the methyl side chain polymers, finely mixed smooth morphology without any measurable phase-separated domains was obtained when blended with PC70BM. This well-mixed thin film morphology between polymer and PC70BM molecules, in particular for MeGeBT:PC70BM devices, leads to the highest Jsc and device efficiency (2.66%). In this work, we clearly demonstrate the role of heavy atoms and side chain lengths in the donor–acceptor bridged copolymers and their effects on device performance in OPVs.
