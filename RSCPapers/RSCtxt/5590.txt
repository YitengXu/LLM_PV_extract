    , Accepted 4th April 2013First published on 4th April 2013AbstractWe review the field of multinary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals, which has gained strongly increasing interest in the quest for novel narrow band gap semiconductors. Small (2–4 nm) CuInS2 and CuInSe2 nanocrystals, for example, exhibit size dependent luminescence in the visible and near infrared range. Their quantum yield can exceed 50% after growth of a ZnS shell, which makes them appealing emitters for lighting, displaying and biological imaging applications. Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanocrystals, on the other hand, can be used as solution processed absorbing materials in thin film solar cells showing high power conversion efficiencies (currently around 8–10%). These examples illustrate that multinary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals have high potential for replacing classical cadmium and lead chalcogenide quantum dots in many fields. We give an overview of the chemical synthesis methods of the different systems reported to date, classifying them according to the obtained crystal structure. Next, we discuss their photophysical properties and give a brief description of the main fields of application. Finally, we conclude by outlining current challenges and related future directions of this exponentially growing domain.
1 Introduction
In the search for novel functional materials with improved optical and electronic properties, semiconductor nanocrystals play a key role. Chemical synthesis gives access to a large variety of compounds in the colloidal state, characterized by an inorganic core and a corona of organic stabilizing ligands. One of their fundamental properties is the dependency of their band gap on the nanocrystal size (quantum confinement effect) when their dimensions are decreased below the Bohr exciton radius. The most well known examples are CdSe quantum dots, whose fluorescence wavelength can be tuned throughout the visible spectrum by changing the mean diameter from around two to seven nanometers. For many applications it is necessary to absorb or emit light at longer wavelengths (lower energy). Biological in vivo imaging and solar power conversion are two prominent examples. Due to the fact that quantum confinement widens the band gap upon decrease in size, it is essential to explore semiconductors with a relatively narrow band gap in the bulk material. In this review we mainly focus on such narrow band gap nanocrystals, with an upper limit of 1.55 eV corresponding to 800 nm. Most binary compounds responding to this requirement contain toxic heavy metals such as Cd, Pb or Hg. Ternary and quaternary compounds, on the other hand, offer a high flexibility for tuning the band gap without relying on toxic elements (Table 1). CuInS2, CuInSe2 (CIS) and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) are important representatives, which have been studied for more than two decades as p-type semiconducting materials for light harvesting in thin film solar cells.1 As an example, optimizing the band gap and energy levels of CIGS via the precise control of composition and deposition conditions led to solar cell efficiencies >20%.2 Compounds comprising two group VI elements (e.g. CuInSSe) or two group III elements (e.g. CIGS) will here be referred to as “pseudo-quaternary” systems. They derive from ternary semiconductors in a way that cations or anions are substituted with ions of the same oxidation state. This is not the case for semiconductors like Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), which we classify as quaternary compounds. Like ternary I–III–VI2 semiconductors can be conceptually derived from binary II–VI semiconductors by replacing two divalent cations with one monovalent and one trivalent cation, quaternary I2–II–IV–VI4 compounds can be derived from ternary I–III–VI2 semiconductors by substituting two trivalent cations with one divalent and one tetravalent cation (Fig. 1). CZTS and CZTSe are emerging materials, which have similar band gaps, p-type conductivity and absorption coefficients to CuInS2 and CuInSe2. Their main advantage is that they do not contain indium whose natural resources are prognosticated to become scarce in the near future.

As compared to the bulk materials, ternary and quaternary semiconductor nanocrystals provide several distinct advantages:
- the band gap and electronic energy levels can be tuned by changing the size (cf.Fig. 2).

- the composition and internal structure can be precisely controlled ex situ, i.e. prior to materials' processing.
- they can be deposited on various substrates by means of low cost solution based methods.
One of the challenges in the synthetic chemistry of I–III–VI2 semiconductor nanocrystals is the control of their composition and crystal structure. In the bulk materials, chalcopyrite semiconductors tolerate a large range of non-stoichiometry. Copper indium selenide is an important example of this family of compounds. Its phase diagram shows a number of off-stoichiometric ordered structures, such as CuIn5Se8, CuIn3Se5, Cu2In4Se7, and so on. However, in contrast to many binary semiconductors, this off-stoichiometry does not lead to the formation of deep trap states, which would compromise the use of these materials in optoelectronics. In fact, Zunger and Lany have shown that in the case of copper-poor conditions defect-pair formation between 2 V−Cu vacancies and In++Cu anti-site defects eliminates deep trap levels.3 Furthermore, the creation of these defect pairs is favored by their very low formation enthalpy. On the other hand, the tendency of CuInSe2 to form Cu vacancies is also at the origin of its efficient self-doping. More generally, both p- and n-type doping can be obtained depending on the stoichiometry, which has been used for the realization of CuInS2 or CuInSe2 homojunction solar cells.4,5 In the case of CuInS2, dopant concentrations on the order of 1017 to 1018 cm−3 have been achieved by varying the sulfur content.
The development of synthesis methods for ternary and quaternary nanocrystals of controlled size, shape, composition and surface chemistry is currently a topic of very active research. Looking at nanocrystals from the above-cited materials, starting from 2008, an exponential increase in publications can be stated, reaching more than 200 papers per year and 2500 citations per year in 2012 (source: Thomson Reuters).
While a number of excellent reviews and book chapters dealing with the synthesis, shape and composition control, assembly and properties of semiconductor nanocrystals exist,7–14 none of them focuses on ternary and quaternary compounds. Our goal is to give an overview of the state-of-the-art of this research field and to outline current challenges. The review is organized as follows: in the first section, we focus on the chemical synthesis of ternary and quaternary nanocrystals with an emphasis on the relationship between reaction parameters and crystal structure. The next section deals with the optical and electronic properties of the title compounds. Their applications are presented in the following, in particular their integration into optoelectronic devices. Finally, we discuss future directions of this field.
2 Synthesis
2.1 Ternary systems: I–III–VI2 semiconductor nanocrystals
Ternary CuInE2 (E = S or Se) compounds are direct semiconductors of relatively narrow band gaps (CuInS2: 1.53 eV; CuInSe2: 1.05 eV) and high absorption coefficients (α ∼ 105 cm−1).15 Both as bulk materials and in the form of nanocrystals they therefore have strong potential for use as absorbing materials in solar cells. In contrast to the bulk, CuInE2 nanocrystals can also show efficient size-dependent photoluminescence. For these reasons, this type of nanocrystal has drawn to date by far the largest research interest among all ternary and quaternary systems. In recent years numerous synthesis methods have been reported, such as hydrothermal techniques, solid-phase synthesis, single source precursor routes, heating-up and hot-injection techniques.
In the bulk, CuInS2 and CuInSe2 exhibit the chalcopyrite crystal structure at room temperature, whereas the zinc blende and wurtzite modifications are only stable at high temperatures. In contrast to this, nanocrystals can exhibit the latter two crystal structures also at room temperature. The chalcopyrite lattice, named after the mineral copper iron sulfide, can be derived from the cubic zinc blende structure by replacing zinc in the cation sublattice with one cation of higher valency (e.g. Fe3+ or In3+) and one cation of lower valency (Cu+) in an ordered manner (cf.Fig. 3). The resulting reduced symmetry of the chalcopyrite structure leads to a primitive cell of eight atoms (vs. two in the zinc blende structure) and to a body centered tetragonal Bravais lattice (space group I2d). If the different cations are distributed randomly, the cubic zinc blende structure is realized; in Fig. 3b each green atom corresponds to either copper or indium. Distinguishing between both structures is not trivial, especially in the case of nanocrystals, because their X-ray diffraction peaks broaden with decreasing size. The chalcopyrite phase can be identified, thanks to the slight tetragonal lattice distortion leading to a lattice parameters ratio of c/2a ∼ 1.004. In addition, minor peaks corresponding to the (101), (103) and (211) reflections are detectable with respect to the cubic phase. In a small number of syntheses the formation of nanocrystals in the hexagonal wurtzite type structure has also been observed (Fig. 3c). Here, once again copper and indium ions are randomly distributed in the cation sublattice. As in the case of II–VI semiconductor nanocrystals, the different polarities of the crystal facets in the hexagonal structure can be exploited for the growth of anisotropic nanocrystals, namely elongated ones (nanorods). In the following, the different reported synthesis methods, summarized in Table 2, have been categorized with respect to the obtained crystal structure.

2.1.1 Ternary Cu–In–E2 nanocrystals in the chalcopyrite structure. 
For the synthesis of CuInE2 (or the corresponding AgInE2) nanocrystals in the chalcopyrite structure, the reactivity of the two cationic precursors has to be balanced. This can be achieved by using appropriate ligands and reaction temperature. As an example, for tuning the reactivity of the Cu precursor it has to be taken into account that Cu+ is a soft Lewis acid and hence appropriate ligands for its complexation have to be searched among soft Lewis bases. One soft Lewis base often used for the synthesis of I–III–VI2 nanocrystals is 1-dodecanethiol (DDT). DDT can simultaneously play the role of the stabilizing ligand and the solvent in the synthesis of CuInS2 nanocrystals. It can further act as a sulfur source as it forms thiolates with various metal salts, which decompose during heating to form the corresponding metal sulfides. The reaction of copper iodide and indium acetate, eventually complexed with fatty acids, in DDT at 180–270 °C yields CuInS2 nanocrystals in the sub-10 nm range, i.e. in the quantum confinement regime, the Bohr exciton radius being around 5 nm. Furthermore, this simple synthetic approach leads to the nearly complete consumption of the cationic precursors and high reaction yields.16–25 Increasing the temperature to more than 290 °C with the goal to prepare bigger nanocrystals results in their precipitation, probably induced by the complete decomposition of dodecanethiol.
Thiourea is another sulfur precursor used in the synthesis of roquesite CuInS2 nanocrystals.26,27 In combination with alcohols used as solvents, big particles of more than 100 nm are formed. On the other hand, the corresponding selenide precursor, selenourea, used with oleylamine (OLA) as both solvent and ligand, leads to nanocrystals <20 nm.28,29 CuInSe2 nanocrystals of low size dispersion were obtained by Koo et al. using this method.28 The nanocrystals are trigonally shaped, related to the polarity and stability of the different chalcopyrite crystal facets (Fig. 4). Furthermore, etching of the nanocrystals was observed in the presence of an excess of OLA. A similar etching effect for CuInSe2 nanocrystals left in a trioctylphosphine (TOP)–OLA mixture was reported by Allen and Bawendi30 and Guo et al.31

Elemental sulfur and selenium are the other widely used anionic precursors. In combination with metal halogenides and OLA, generally small nanocrystals are obtained,32–37 because OLA efficiently passivates the nuclei and decelerates the growth rate of the particles. The addition of TOP, trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) or trioctylphosphite (TOOP), permits to obtain larger particles under the same growth conditions (time and temperature).23 Using Se powder with TOPO, TOP or oleic acid (OA) as surfactants leads to the formation of aggregates.38,39 On the other hand, when dioctylphosphine oxide (DOPO) is present together with TOPO, TOP and Se powder, nanowires are formed. In fact, DOPO acts as a weaker surfactant than OLA and is supposed to promote anisotropic growth.38 Replacing OLA with ethylenediamine yields large nanoparticles or rods.40–43 Se powder is also used in combination with alkylthiols such as DDT. It reacts with the intermediates, e.g. Cu–In–(S–R)x, formed in the presence of cationic precursors19,24,44,45 by cleaving the Cu–S or In–S bond, leading to small particles (3–6 nm).44,45


2.1.2 Ternary Cu–In–E2 nanocrystals in the wurtzite structure. 
Pan et al. were the first to report the synthesis of wurtzite CuInS2 nanocrystals and demonstrate the importance of the capping ligand ratio (OA, DDT, OLA) for the control of the crystal structure.46 In more recent papers, the influence of the nature and concentration of the surface ligands on the growth rate of the nanocrystals has been shown to be at the origin of different structures.47–49 In the case of ternary nanocrystals, amines play a key role in various syntheses for obtaining the wurtzite phase.48–51 Nearly monodisperse wurtzite CuInSe2 nanocrystals can for example be synthesized by using diphenylselenide and OLA in combination with Cu–oleate and InCl3 (cf.Fig. 5).51 An intermediate phase of well-calibrated CuSe nanocrystals forms initially, which acts as a template for the growth of monodisperse CuInSe2 nanocrystals in the wurtzite phase.

As mentioned before, the hexagonal wurtzite structure is particularly well suited for switching from the isotropic growth of spherical nanocrystals to the growth of 1-D nanorods. In fact, by the judicious choice of surface ligands the growth rate of some crystal facets can be significantly reduced. Kruszynska et al. reported the synthesis of elongated CuInS2 nanocrystals in the wurtzite phase using metal acetates, OLA, DDT and TOPO as stabilizers and tert-dodecanethiol as the sulfur source.52 Cu2S nanocrystals are formed in the initial stages of the reaction, being at the origin of the phase and shape control. Similar results had been obtained earlier by Connor et al.53 who showed that the growth of anisotropic CuInS2 nanocrystals takes place via the formation of Cu2S nanodisks in a reaction medium containing metal oleates, DDT and OLA. In both cases the Cu2S seed particles disappear from the CuInS2 nanocrystals with increasing reaction time, as a consequence of the high diffusivity of copper in the anionic lattice. The same mechanism has been postulated by Lu et al. who prepared nanorods of unprecedented low size and shape dispersion by reacting the metal nitrates in DDT and adding controlled amounts of either OLA or OA (Fig. 6).54

In the case of the single source precursor [(Ph3P)CuIn(SC{O}Ph)4], the formation of wurtzite CuInS2 nanocrystals has been reported in the presence of DDT and TOPO.55 For an equimolar mixture of DDT and TOPO, the pure wurtzite phase is obtained at reaction temperatures between 150 °C and 250 °C. At higher temperatures an increase of the TOPO content is necessary to avoid the formation of a mixture of wurtzite and zinc blende nanocrystals.


2.1.3 Ternary Cu–In–E2 nanocrystals in the zinc blende structure. 
As pointed out before, the unambiguous differentiation between the chalcopyrite and the zinc blende structure by means of powder X-ray diffraction is hampered by the structural similarity of both phases and the peak broadening due to the small crystallite size. Therefore, only few literature examples report the observation of the zinc blende phase, all of them leading to small particles (max. 8 nm).47,56–62
In conclusion of this section, most of the synthetic approaches lead to the formation of CuInE2 nanocrystals in the chalcopyrite structure. Growth of ternary nanocrystals in the wurtzite phase takes place via the initial formation of monodisperse Cu2E or CuE (E = S, Se) seeds in the presence of amines, such as OLA. Anisotropic shapes have been observed exclusively in the wurtzite structure.


2.1.4 Ternary Ag–In–E2 nanocrystals. 
In contrast to the discussed CuInE2 compounds, AgInE2 nanocrystals have mainly been reported in the orthorhombic phase (a ≠ b ≠ c; α = β = γ = 90°). Vittal et al. were the first to describe the synthesis of orthorhombic AgInSe2 and AgInS2 nanocrystals of low size dispersion.63,64 A single source precursor, DDT, and an additional ligand, namely OLA in the case of AgInSe2 rods and OA in the case of AgInS2 nanocrystals, were used. In these experiments the synergistic effect of the two ligands was demonstrated. When the synthesis was carried out in DDT alone, agglomerates were obtained for AgInS2 and a bulk material was obtained for AgInSe2. When using OLA alone, irregular shaped AgInSe2 nanocrystals were formed, while for OA alone micrometer sized AgInS2 nanocrystals were obtained. It is also possible to synthesize small AgInS2 nanocrystals using separate metal precursors, such as silver nitrate and indium acetate in combination with DDT and OA.60,65 The formation of rod shaped AgInS2 nanocrystals was observed when decreasing the reaction temperature below 100 °C.60 According to the proposed reaction mechanism, the low reaction temperature causes the formation of a smaller number of nuclei, which in turn leads to a higher residual monomer concentration in the solution. The resulting high chemical potential environment is required for the growth of elongated nanocrystals. Using OLA instead of OA in the previous reaction scheme led to the formation of small particles of less than 9 nm diameter.66,67 As before, when decreasing the reaction temperature from 200 °C to 140 °C nanorods have been obtained, which was attributed once again to the higher residual monomer concentration.67


2.1.5 “Pseudo-quaternary” I–(III,III′)–VI2 and I–III–(VI,VI′)2 nanocrystals. 
“Pseudo-quaternary” CuInSSe nanocrystals in the chalcopyrite structure were obtained by using Se and S powder in combination with amines as ligand and solvent. For the synthesis of CuInSSe in the chalcopyrite structure, OLA was used to control the stoichiometry and growth rate as well as to stabilize the nanocrystals in solution.34,68 Replacing OLA with ethylenediamine led to aggregated products due to the insufficient steric repulsion provided by this short ligand.69 In the case of CuIn0.5Ga0.5Se2, syntheses using alkylamines and Se powder have been reported.36,70 Here, hexadecylamine (HDA) was shown to provide a lower size dispersion as compared to OLA.70 Different stages occurring during the synthesis were identified: upon injection of Se into the solution of the metal–HDA complexes amorphous nanoparticles of In2Se3, CuSe, and CuGaSe2 as well as Se nanorods appeared, which transformed during temperature increase to CuIn0.5Ga0.5Se2 nanocrystals. Synthesis of small (2–3 nm) CuIn0.5Ga0.5S2 nanocrystals in the chalcopyrite structure using a combination of single source precursors and ethanedithiol was also reported.71 Finally, Wang et al. carried out the synthesis of CuIn0.5Ga0.5S2 in the presence of tert-DDT and 1-DDT and obtained nanocrystals in the wurtzite structure with tadpole or rod-like morphology.72
Due to the very low lattice mismatch between CuInS2 (or AgInS2) and ZnS (2–3%), it is possible to prepare solid solutions of both compounds in a wide range of compositions. Furthermore, ZnS is used as a shell material for CuInS2 nanocrystals with the goal to improve their photoluminescence properties. In this context, ZnS provides several appealing features: it is a large band gap semiconductor (3.6 eV) exhibiting a type I band alignment with CuInS2, and shows good chemical stability. CuInS2/ZnS core–shell nanocrystals are usually formed in a two-step reaction, during which the ZnS shell is grown by adding a Zn precursor (Zn stearate or Zn acetate) to the colloidal solution of the core nanocrystals.16,17,60,73–77 Practically, it is difficult to determine whether real core–shell systems with an abrupt interface between two materials, graded structures or solid solution nanocrystals are obtained when adding zinc. The X-ray diffractograms generally show a slight shift of all peaks towards the positions of ZnS. Standard TEM analysis does not allow distinguishing the core–shell interface due to the similarity of the crystal structure. High-resolution TEM elemental mapping by means of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS),78 high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) Z-contrast imaging79 or XPS analysis using variable photon energy80 are techniques which are more appropriate for the elucidation of the internal structure. It is generally observed that the photoluminescence quantum yield of CuInS2 nanocrystals significantly improves upon addition of Zn, indicating that Zn ions or ZnS passivate volume and/or surface related trap states (see chapter 3).
AgInS2–ZnS solid solution nanocrystals have been obtained through the thermal decomposition of a single source dithiocarbamate type precursor containing all three metals.81,82 The resulting AgInS2–ZnS nanocrystals exhibited the chalcopyrite structure. Tang et al. reported the synthesis of ZnS–AgInS2 heterodimers by adding zinc stearate to a reaction solution of indium acetate, silver nitrate, oleic acid, DDT and TOP in ODE.65 Zinc addition led to the growth of a ZnS domain on one side of the AgInS2 nanocrystals and to the transformation of the AgInS2 crystal structure from orthorhombic to chalcopyrite. Upon prolonged heating the diffusion of Zn into the AgInS2 lattice resulted in a blue shift of the emission wavelength (cf. chapter 3).

2.2 Quaternary systems
The stoichiometric control of quaternary nanocrystals is complicated by the tendency of forming a plurality of compositional phases in initial reaction stages due to the difference in reactivity of the cationic precursors.
Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) are the most widely studied types of quaternary semiconductors as they are considered as viable alternatives for replacing CIGS in thin film solar cells. In the bulk, they adopt the tetragonal kesterite structure (space group I, Fig. 7), which comprises alternating cation layers of CuSn and CuZn in the direction of the crystallographic c-axis. The stannite structure (space group I2m), also observed for this class of materials, differs in the composition of the cation layers: here SnZn and pure Cu layers alternate in the c direction. A differentiation between the isoelectronic cations Cu+ and Zn2+ by X-ray diffraction is hampered by their similar scattering power. However, their different neutron scattering lengths make it possible to use neutron diffraction for structural determination.109 Based on the synthesis methods reported for other binary and ternary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals, similar approaches have been developed in recent years for CZTS, CZTSe and a few other materials, which are summarized in Table 3.

2.2.1 CZTS nanocrystals. 
In 2009, three groups reported quasi simultaneously the synthesis of CZTS nanocrystals: Guo et al. injected the S precursor solution (elemental sulfur in OLA) into the hot solution of the metal precursors in OLA,110 while Riha et al. injected both the S/OLA and metal precursor solutions into hot trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO).111 The procedure of Steinhagen et al. differs from the others in the way that all precursors are mixed at room temperature in OLA and then heated to 280 °C.112 The mean sizes are all above 10 nm and therefore no significant difference of the absorption onset (induced by quantum confinement effects) from that of the bulk material has been observed. The procedure of Riha showed a better control of the size dispersion (12.8 ± 1.8 nm) than the other two methods. Due to a peak broadening, the XRD patterns of the nanocrystals do not permit the identification of their crystalline phase, however kesterite as the thermodynamically more stable phase is likely to be predominant. In order to rule out the possibility of having synthesised a stoichiometric mixture of Cu2SnS3 and ZnS, which would result in a very similar XRD pattern (Fig. 8), Riha et al. carried out a thermogravimetric analysis of their samples, corroborating the presence of pure CZTS nanocrystals.

In the meantime, several modifications of these methods, still based on the use of elemental sulfur and OLA, have been proposed leading to nanocrystals of faceted or spherical shape in a size range of 5 to 25 nm.114–119 Shorter amines like ethylenediamine, used as a solvent and ligand, yielded small aggregated particles114 or wires.115 Thiourea has also been proposed as a sulfur precursor with ethylene glycol as a solvent resulting however in most cases in large, aggregated particles (100–500 nm).113,116,117,120 Using OLA as a ligand and solvent in combination with thiourea yielded smaller particles (20 × 15 nm).121 The synthesis of small CZTS nanocrystals with a size tunable from 2 to 7 nm has been achieved by using the metal diethyldithiocarbamates in OLA.118,119 Besides the kesterite phase, in a few examples other crystal structures have also been observed. CZTS nanocrystals in the orthorhombic phase have been prepared in an aqueous synthesis using thiocarbamide as the sulfur precursor and ethylenediamine as the ligand.122 Without ethylenediamine, the kesterite phase was obtained. When using alkylthiols as the stabilizing ligand, generally the formation of the wurtzite phase occurred.123–125 In the presence of an amine (OLA or trioctylamine) elongated shaped nanocrystals resulted. When studying the effect of thiols (1-DDT and tert-DDT) in the absence of amines on the formation of wurtzite CZTS nanocrystals, Singh et al. observed that a combination of both compounds is necessary for the formation of nanorods.124


2.2.2 CZTSe and other types of quaternary nanocrystals. 
Shavel et al. first prepared CZTSe nanocrystals by complexing the metal chlorides with hexadecylamine in ODE, followed by the injection of TOPSe at 295 °C.78 The obtained X-ray data were assigned to the stannite structure and EELS confirmed the homogeneous internal composition of the highly faceted 20 nm nanocrystals. More recently, efforts have been made to develop phosphine-free synthetic routes with the goal to overcome limitations related to the air sensitivity and cost of tertiary phosphines like TOP. In this context Liu et al. dissolved selenium powder in DDT and OLA to obtain soluble alkylammonium selenide, which was injected at 180 °C to a solution of metal chlorides in an OLA–DDT mixture.126 The obtained small (3–4 nm) CZTSe nanocrystals exhibited a band gap of approximately 1.7 eV indicating quantum confinement effects.
Recently, nanocrystals of other materials, such as Cu2ZnGeSe4,127,128 Cu2CdSnSe4129 and Cu2FeSnS4,130 have emerged. In the first case, Ibañez et al. injected a new type of selenium precursor, selenium dioxide dissolved in ODE, at 295 °C in a solution of CuCl, GeCl4, ZnO, tetradecylphosphonic acid and hexadecylamine in ODE.127,128 The resulting nanocrystals showed a low size dispersion and their diameter could be varied from 5 to 30 nm (Fig. 9).

As can be seen from these few recent examples, the huge variety of possible elemental combinations in quaternary nanocrystals constitutes a very fertile playground for chemists and opens ways for designing novel functional materials. The rapid progress in the development of chemical synthesis methods allows for controlling simultaneously the size, shape and composition of multinary nanocrystals. On the other hand, a better understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms is needed for a more rational design of syntheses. Finally, the precise elucidation of the internal structure is challenging and requires the combination of state-of-the-art microscopic, spectroscopic and diffraction techniques.

3 Photophysical and electronic properties
Considering the applications of ternary and quaternary nanocrystals in various fields, the determination of the optical and electronic properties as well as their correlation with the structural properties are of foremost importance. Information about the band gap and the distribution of intra band gap energy levels can be obtained primarily from photophysical studies. Ternary and quaternary nanocrystals have characteristic photoluminescence (PL) properties distinguishing them from binary nanocrystals. In the latter (e.g. II–VI or III–V semiconductor nanocrystals), photogenerated electron–hole pairs (excitons) rapidly undergo radiative recombination, on a timescale of tens of nanoseconds. As mentioned before, ternary and quaternary nanocrystals tolerate a large range of non-stoichiometric compositions and their more complex crystal structure leads to different PL mechanisms. The photophysical properties of multinary nanocrystals have been mainly studied for two systems: CuInS2 and AgInS2 and their core–shell or solid solution structures with ZnS. These systems exhibit a size-dependent absorption onset, however, no clearly distinguishable excitonic peak is visible in the UV-vis spectra. Their photoluminescence spectra are characterized by a broad emission peak (FWHM: 100–150 nm), a comparably long lifetime (hundreds of ns) and a significant Stokes shift (0.5–0.6 eV). These PL properties can be explained in terms of donor–acceptor pair (DAP) recombinations – a well known phenomenon in bulk semiconductor photophysics.94 In contrast to many binary nanocrystals, ternary and quaternary nanocrystals contain a significant density of donor and acceptor states located in the band gap. The relaxation of photogenerated charge carriers to these states occurs on a faster timescale than band edge recombination. Subsequently, radiative de-excitation occurs via different possible pathways (cf.Fig. 10). This process is generally characterized by a non-exponential PL decay with a shift of the emission peak to lower energy as time evolves. Owing to the fact that the Coulomb attraction between adjacent DAPs is stronger than between distant ones, recombination starts initially at closer pairs with higher interactions and then progresses to more distant, weaker bound pairs. The second phenomenon characteristic of DAP recombinations is a shift to higher energy of the PL spectrum as the excitation intensity increases: statistically, at low excitation levels mostly distant DAPs are generated; as the system gets saturated, at higher excitation intensity the probability to excite adjacent DAPs of larger interaction energies increases. Both characteristic phenomena have been observed for ternary nanocrystals.74,142,143 In addition to DAP recombination,16,20,73,81,102,142 radiative relaxation implying transitions from the conduction band to acceptor states close to the valence band16,17,74,94,102 or via surface defects144 has been reported. The donor and acceptor states in ternary systems usually originate from internal defects, such as vacancies and interstitial atoms. In the case of CuInS2 nanocrystals, for example, the donor sites may include sulfur vacancies, interstitial Cu ions or In substituted at Cu sites (antisite defect), while acceptors include Cu vacancies, interstitial In ions and Cu substituted at In sites. As a consequence, the PL mechanism at work in a given system strongly depends on the exact stoichiometry and structure of the nanocrystals.
 Fig. 10  Scheme of the possible relaxation pathways in ternary and quaternary nanocrystals. Band edge emission (PL1) is generally not observed due to the rapid relaxation of excited carriers to surface or internal defects, from which different desexcitation paths are possible (PL2, PL3), including DAP recombinations. 
Radiative recombination implying internal defects is not the exclusive mechanism of relaxation in ternary and quaternary nanocrystals. It is generally accompanied by a non-radiative decay through surface traps lowering the overall PL quantum yield. In this context, the analysis of the PL data from the synthesis methods listed in Table 2 shows that the use of alkylthiols such as DDT is beneficial for obtaining a significant emission signal from core CuInS2, CuInSe2 and AgInS2 nanocrystals. This indicates that alkylthiols play an important role in passivating surface trap states. As for many other types of nanocrystals, surface traps can also be eliminated by growing a shell of another semiconductor, in particular ZnS. However, pure or predominant band edge emission has so far not been observed as can be judged from the broad PL line width and long lifetimes, even in the case of highly engineered structures, such as Ag(In,Ga)S2 solid solution nanocrystals145 or CuInS2–ZnS/ZnSe/ZnS core–shell–shell nanocrystals.75
The DAP related emission of multinary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals opens prospects for tuning their PL properties through the variation of donor and acceptor state levels. This can be done by changing the chemical composition of the nanocrystals. Incorporation of a fourth element into the crystalline structure of ternary nanocrystals perturbs the internal electronic states and can result in a PL shift. For example, incorporation of Zn2+ in the crystal structure and formation of solid solution nanocrystals of CuInS2–ZnS,56,73,75,146 CuInSe2–ZnS,147 AgInS2–ZnS,81,148,149 or AgIn5S8–ZnS143 lead to a PL shift to shorter wavelengths. The same applies to the gradual replacement of In3+ by Ga3+ in CuInS271,72,150 or AgInS2 nanocrystals.145 There is no unique established origin of this blue shift as it strongly depends on the specific system under study. By consequence, several interpretations have been proposed. The first one is the widening of the band gap as a result of Zn incorporation, resulting in a concomitant shift of the donor and acceptor levels.146,147,151 Another possible explanation is the size reduction of the ternary core, which supposes etching processes152 or cation exchange at the surface of the CuInS2 (or AgInS2) nanocrystals. The decreasing distance between donor and acceptor sites results in growing DAP interaction, increasing the probability of the DAP recombination and yielding PL at higher energy.22,76 In core–shell systems, a reduction of the effective core diameter can originate from the compression exerted by the shell material if the latter has a smaller lattice parameter.152 Finally, Zn or other added elements may passivate internal defect states and thus modify or eliminate the DAP recombination pathways.56 In addition to the change of emission wavelength, the variation of composition and in particular the growth of a ZnS shell generally result in a significant PL efficiency enhancement leading to luminescence quantum yields up to 80%.146,148,153 Recently, the possibility of Mn doping into CuInS2–ZnS and AgInS2–ZnS solid solution nanocrystals has been demonstrated and Mn-related emission has been observed.77
Even though an estimation of the evolution of the band gap of ternary nanocrystals with size has been recently provided from theoretical calculations (see Fig. 2),6 experimental data are lacking for many materials. One exception is CuInS2, for which Scholes and co-workers provided a set of UV-vis, PL and PLE data as a function of NC size, used for the extraction of the curve presented in Fig. 11.19 For many other systems the rather featureless UV-vis absorption spectra and broad PL peaks observed for multinary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals have not yet permitted the precise determination of the optical band gap and its evolution with size. It is therefore helpful to complete the information extracted from optical measurements by data obtained from other techniques. Electrochemical methods, especially cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV),154,155 can be employed to determine the conduction and valence band positions of nanocrystals by measuring their reduction and oxidation potentials and comparing with a reference. To date detailed electrochemical studies of ternary and quaternary nanocrystals are not yet available. Generally, the problem is the low current intensity of the nanocrystal systems, which is comparable to the noise originating from the electrolyte. The reported CV data on CuInS2 and CuInSe2 nanocrystals indicate quantum size effects,19,58,156,157 however, there is a significant discrepancy in the absolute position of the energy levels measured by different groups.

Many applications of multinary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals rely on their high collective electrical conductivity. Examples are solar cells, photodetectors and thermoelectric devices. For these applications it is extremely important to provide maximum electronic interaction between the individual nanocrystals forming the active layer of the device. A common practice for improving the charge carrier mobility in nanocrystal solids is to exchange or remove the corona of organic surface ligands. They are essential for the synthesis and manipulation of nanocrystals as they control their nucleation/growth kinetics, passivate dangling bonds on their surface and maintain their colloidal solubility. In the case of the aforementioned applications, however, these ligands are detrimental to the device performances. Generally containing long alkyl chains, they hamper charge transfer and transport within the nanocrystal layer. Two main strategies are usually adopted to circumvent this problem:
1. Sintering. This process consists of the heating of the nanocrystal solid above the temperature of desorption and eventually degradation of organic molecules (generally >300 °C). It efficiently removes the organic ligand layer and improves the overall conductivity of the film. Sintering of the ternary and quaternary nanocrystals is widely used in the fabrication of all-inorganic nanocrystal based solar cells31,67,110,158–166,173,174 and in thermoelectric devices.127,129,167 The main disadvantages of sintering are the high energetic cost and the incompatibility with flexible substrates. Furthermore, uncontrolled ripening and nanocrystal aggregation can lead to a large distribution of electronic states through the loss of quantum confinement, modification of the crystal structure and appearance of grain boundaries. Finally, the process bears the risk of forming carbonaceous degradation products, which can contaminate the nanocrystal layer and deteriorate electrical transport.
2. Ligand exchange. This method involves pre- or post-deposition replacement of the initial passivating ligands. Long organic ligands are usually replaced either with shorter organic ones such as 1,2-ethanedithiol or pyridine29,58,132,134,168 or by small inorganic ones, such as metal chalcogenide complexes (Sn2S64−) or simple ions like S2−, HS− or OH−.169,170 This process allows decreasing considerably the inter-nanocrystal distance and improving the conductivity within nanocrystal layers by several orders of magnitude. However, in the case of the post-deposition treatment this shrinking can lead to the formation of cracks in the nanocrystal solid. To avoid this phenomenon, it is preferable to build up the nanocrystal film in a layer-by-layer fashion, where only very thin nanocrystal layers are deposited each time, followed by the solid-state ligand exchange.
An alternative method to improve the conductivity of ternary and quaternary nanocrystalline films is the use of anisotropic nanostructures. Indeed, elongated nanocrystals provide more direct electronic pathways for the charge carriers; with longer nanostructures, charge carrier hopping and associated recombination and trap losses are limited. Ideally, the anisotropic nanocrystals should be aligned in the direction of the charge transport. Several anisotropic forms of the nanocrystals covered by this review have been used in photovoltaics: nanorods,141,157,171 nanowires,103 and nanotubes.172
4.1 Solar cells
Materials based on ternary and quaternary chalcogenides are known to have large absorption coefficients with excellent coverage of the solar spectrum and high stability against solar irradiation. These qualities make them very attractive as light absorbing materials in photovoltaic cells. Traditionally, ternary and quaternary materials, such as CuInSe2, CIGS and CZTS, are processed by means of thin film deposition technologies;1,178 however, the necessity to use elevated temperatures and vacuum techniques, coupled with a high material consumption and non-uniformity of the obtained thin layers, results in an increased cost of solar panels. Deposition of absorbing materials for photovoltaic applications starting from nanocrystal colloidal solutions, also called “inks” in this context, provides a promising alternative to traditional techniques (Table 4).179,180 Nanocrystals can be fabricated on the industrial scale; they can be easily dispersed in a variety of solvents compatible with the use of low cost wet deposition techniques. We will discuss here three types of solar cells that use multinary nanocrystals: all-inorganic cells, hybrid organic–inorganic cells, and nanocrystal (quantum dot) sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs).

The highest power conversion efficiencies have so far been obtained for the all-inorganic solar cells: a nanocrystalline CZTSSe absorber layer, obtained by deposition of binary copper sulfide and zinc sulfide nanocrystals as well as ternary copper tin sulfide nanocrystals, followed by thermal annealing in the presence of selenium, yielded an efficiency of 8.5%.181 Importantly, the proposed method allowed for conveniently controlling the stoichiometry of the nanocrystalline film, and in agreement with earlier results the best efficiencies have been obtained for copper-poor and zinc-rich films. A typical photovoltaic device of this type consists of a soda lime glass substrate, a bottom contact of Mo, a p-type nanocrystalline absorber layer with a buffer layer of CdS, a top layer of n-type ZnO and finally a metal (e.g. Ag) top contact (Fig. 12).182 The nanocrystals are deposited onto the substrate by solution techniques such as drop-, spray-, spin-coating or doctor-blading of the inks. After the deposition, the nanocrystalline layer needs to be densified in order to create sufficient interconnections between the nanocrystals and hence provide proper percolation pathways, which is typically achieved by sintering.31,67,110,158–166 During this high temperature treatment the metal chalcogenides tend to lose a fraction of the selenium or sulfur initially present in the films. Therefore, the annealing step is generally carried out in the presence of these elements or compounds like H2Se to maintain proper material composition and crystallinity (“selenization”, “sulfurization”). Selenization is also used to partially replace sulfur with selenium in films made of CuInS2 or CZTS nanocrystals.

Standard selenization procedures are carried out at high temperature (450–550 °C), which increases the process costs and precludes the possibility of employing low melting point substrates such as flexible plastic films. Alternative all-inorganic solar cell architectures with multinary nanocrystals have been developed at lower temperatures by the groups of Korgel36,103,112,170,183,184 and others.141 In these devices the less efficient charge transport with respect to sintered nanocrystalline films is compensated by the improvement of percolation using anisotropic nanostructures (e.g. CuInSe2 nanowires103) or by ligand exchange.29,169,170 So far the performances of low-temperature processed all-inorganic solar cells are below those of sintered ones but rapid progress is going on.
In the active layer of hybrid organic–inorganic solar cells nanocrystals generally act as an absorbing n-type material in conjunction with p-type organic materials, in most cases semiconducting π-conjugated polymers.185 As for inorganic cells, in hybrids, multinary nanocrystals can provide very good absorption coefficients and optimal band gaps. Typically, hybrid active layers are prepared by mixing the nanocrystals and the conjugated polymer in solution and spin-coating them onto a substrate. Such nanocomposites ideally comprise continuous inter-penetrated networks of both materials (“bulk heterojunction”) assuring a large interface area and hence efficient charge separation as well as the charge transport to the terminals of the solar cell. Examples using multinary nanocrystals have been reported for CuInS221,175,176,186 and CuInSe2.156 Here once again, the layer of passivating ligands on the nanocrystal surface constitutes a barrier for the charge transfer between the organic and inorganic constituents of the hybrid. As the organics excludes the use of sintering, ligand exchange has to be applied to improve the conductivity in the nanocrystal phase where charge transport occurs via hopping.58,132 Although the concept of hybrid solar cells is very appealing, to date their performances do not reach those of the other device types discussed here (Table 4).
In the third type of solar cells, QDSSCs, an n-type wide band gap nanostructured electrode, typically made of mesoporous TiO2 or ZnO nanowires, is sensitized by a thin layer of light-absorbing multinary nanocrystals. Because of the large developed surface/interface of the nanostructured electrode, a very thin nanocrystal layer is sufficient to absorb a substantial amount of solar light. Several methods of deposition of this nanocrystalline layer exist, the simplest being drop-casting140,187 or dip-coating188 of a solution of nanocrystals on top of the electrode. Alternatively, bifunctional molecules, usually mercaptocarboxylic acids, can be used for the controlled deposition of one monolayer of nanocrystals on the metal oxide electrode.189–192 Methods aiming at the fabrication of nanocrystals in situ directly on the electrode generally give limited control of size, composition and surface quality.172,177 Lee et al. fabricated a nanometric CuInSe2 shell (sheath) around ZnO nanowires, which can also serve as a sacrificial template for the formation of CuInSe2 nanotubes.193 The role of multinary nanocrystals in solar cells is not limited to light absorbers: recently CZTS nanocrystals have been used as a counter-electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells. In this case a selenized CZTS nanocrystal layer on top of FTO glass provided a low-cost alternative to classical platinum electrodes.194
4.2 Light-emitting diodes
In light-emitting diodes (LEDs) positive and negative charges are injected by means of electrodes and some auxiliary layers into a layer of nanocrystals, where they recombine radiatively. The major challenge for employing multinary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals in LEDs stems from their particular photophysical properties stated above: broad photoluminescence combined with long lifetime. Because of the strong luminescence quenching by surface traps, LEDs generally require the use of core–shell nanocrystals197 to improve the emission efficiency and photostability. Table 5 demonstrates that essentially CuInS2 and AgInS2 based core–shell structures have been applied, as they exhibit the highest PL quantum yield of all ternary and quaternary systems reported so far. As an example, Zhong et al. integrated highly emissive CuInS2/ZnS core–shell nanocrystals (PL quantum yield 65%) into a classical structure, which is widely employed in organic LEDs.20 Yellow and orange LEDs with a high luminance of 2100 cd m−2 were obtained. In another report CuInS2–ZnS (solid solution)/ZnSe/ZnS core–shell–shell nanocrystals were integrated into red, yellow and green LEDs showing maximum luminance values of 1200–1600 cd m−2 (Fig. 13).75 Xu et al. prepared a white light LED by mixing red emission from CuInS2–ZnS/ZnS core–shell nanocrystals with a green-blue emitting organic film of poly-TPD using a bilayer structure.198

Ternary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals have also been used as photoluminescence wavelength up-converters (energy down-converters) of existing UV or blue LEDs. As an example, the photoluminescence of yellow emitting ternary core–shell nanocrystals has been combined with the emission of commercial blue LEDs for the additive generation of white light.18,150,199,200
4.3 Fluorescent biological imaging

Biological imaging likewise necessitates highly fluorescent and photostable nanocrystals, which in addition should be soluble in aqueous medium. For in vivo applications further requirements come into play: small hydrodynamic diameters (≪ 10 nm) facilitate nanocrystals' elimination via renal clearance; near-infrared emission avoids light scattering and absorption in biological media; and finally, non-toxic elements prevent organism poisoning in the case of undesired nanocrystals' decomposition. Ternary chalcopyrite type nanocrystals fulfil all these requirements and are therefore very good candidates for the design of in vivo biological probes. By growth of a ZnS shell, the QY of CuInS2, CuInSe2 and AgInS2 nanocrystals can be increased to values as high as 80%.153 Size and/or compositional variations allow tuning the emission wavelength of the nanocrystals to fit the optimal spectral window for in vivo imaging of 700–900 nm (cf.Fig. 14, Table 6).17,61,62,99,202 Their broad emission line width remains a drawback for their application in multiplexing experiments, relying on the detection of different fluorescent labels at the same time. Their long emission lifetime, on the other hand, can be exploited in time-gated imaging where a delay is applied between the excitation and detection moment in order to eliminate short-lived autofluorescence from the biological environment. AgInS2 and CuInS2 based nanocrystals can be used in the two-photon absorption mode eventually allowing probing of thick samples by multiphoton excitation spectroscopy.65,99 Finally, by combining nanocrystals of CuInS2/ZnS with magnetite, Chang et al. prepared nanohybrids suitable for dual mode, fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging.203

4.4 Other applications

Photodetectors. Current efforts to integrate ternary and quaternary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals into thin film photodetectors mainly aim at the near infrared range, not covered by all-organic devices. This field is dominated by PbS quantum dots. CuInSe2 and CZTSe nanocrystals have been used as lead-free alternatives in hybrid active layers with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).51,209,210 In another example, a specially developed synthesis yielded ligand-free CuInSe2 nanocrystals, which were directly integrated by spin-coating into an all-inorganic flexible photodetector.93 Finally, alloyed Au–CuInSe2 nanoparticles showed enhanced performances with respect to neat CuInSe2 nanocrystals in a hybrid photodetector, which was explained by plasmonic resonance absorption.211

Thermoelectrics. The use of nanostructures has strongly improved the performances of thermoelectric (TE) devices within the past 15 years. TE materials are characterized by the figure of merit ZT, which is proportional to the Seebeck coefficient (S), the electrical conductivity (σ) and the temperature, and inversely proportional to the thermal conductivity (κ). The thermal conductivity of nanostructured materials, such as quantum dots, quantum wells or nanowires, can be significantly reduced due to the phonon scattering on grain boundaries.212 Moreover, the small size of semiconductor nanocrystals increases the electron density of states near the Fermi level and thus can enhance the power factor (S2σ). Owing to their particular crystal structure (e.g. in kesterite), quaternary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals show enhanced phonon scattering and thus lower thermal conductivity than classical binary semiconductors. Furthermore, the layered character of their structure also allows decoupling electrical conductivity from the Seebeck coefficient. By means of colloidal synthesis the composition of nanocrystals can by fine-tuned to optimise their TE properties. The research in this domain is still young and so far only few examples of TE materials based on ternary and quaternary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals have been reported: Cu2CdSnSe4,129,168 Cu2ZnGeSe4,127 Cu2SnSe3,167 and CZTS,134 yielding ZT values of 0.5–0.7. One drawback slowing down the progress in this field is the inherently lower electrical conductivity of nanocrystals compared to the bulk materials related to the insulating character of surface ligands. As for solar cell devices two major strategies are used to improve the conductivity of a layer of nanocrystals in TE devices: ligand exchange,134,168 and high temperature annealing to completely remove the organic ligands.127,129,167

Photocatalysis. The photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants has gained strong attention in recent years. It has been demonstrated that nanostructured TiO2 can act as an active and cheap photocatalyst, however its low absorption in the visible spectrum and fast recombination of electron–hole pairs make it necessary to use additional photosensitizing materials. Owing to their strong absorption of solar light and environmentally benign character many ternary and quaternary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals are promising sensitizers of TiO2 for photocatalytic applications.213–216 Also zinc oxide, in the form of microspheres, has been sensitized by CuInS2 and/or CuInSe2 nanocrystals.217 The direct use of non-supported nanocrystals as photocatalysts in solution has been demonstrated but is less convenient from a practical point of view.57,59,218
Finally, hybrids of organic polymers with CuInS2/ZnS showing electrical bistability have been proposed for use in non-volatile memories.219,220 Building on their interesting electrochemical properties, like discharge capacity and cycling behaviour, some multinary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals are also being explored as anode materials in Li-ion batteries.135,221
5 Conclusions and perspectives
The present review shows that ternary and quaternary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals are taking an important place in the search for cadmium- and lead-free materials of narrow band gap semiconductors. This field is still in its infancy, and it can be expected that in the near future significant progress will be achieved in the development of synthetic methods, understanding of the properties and practical uses of this type of nanocrystal. At present, the following challenges have to be met:
(1) In terms of synthesis, the elucidation of reaction mechanisms is of particular importance in multinary nanocrystals, as they can form a much larger variety of compositional phases than binary compounds. As shown, the stoichiometry and internal structure strongly influence the optical and electronic properties. In this context, the analysis of reaction aliquots for the determination of growth kinetics and intermediate phases is already common practice. In addition, the identification of reactive intermediates, i.e. of the complexes formed during the initial heating step prior to nanocrystals' nucleation, e.g. by NMR and mass spectroscopy, is of prime importance. The same applies to “side products”, such as those arising from modifications of the organic stabilizing ligands during the reaction.
(2) While there are already a few studies on the photophysical properties of multinary chalcogenide nanocrystals, a deeper understanding of the relaxation processes is needed taking into account the complex nature of the involved electronic structure. Theoretical modeling of the defect physics in different systems is required for the attribution of the optical transitions revealed by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. Practically, the control of defect states by the formation of solid solution nanocrystals and core–shell structures enables the increase of the PL quantum yield and the decrease of the PL line width. In these systems, for example CuInS2–ZnS, the elucidation of the internal structure and distinction between a solid solution, graded or core–shell structure is a subject of active research. Recent progress in the field of nanocrystals' doping proves the high potential of this approach to tune or enhance their emission, absorption, electronic and/or magnetic properties. By introducing external elements and varying their atomic concentrations one can modify the electronic configuration and create new recombination mechanisms. The crystalline structure of ternary and quaternary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals advantageously provides an easy accommodation of dopant ions in the lattice.
(3) The fundamental electronic properties of ternary and quaternary metal chalcogenide nanocrystals including their band gap energy and absolute energy level positions need to be determined more precisely. This has to be done for each particular system, as the electronic properties depend on the size, composition and nature of surface ligands. In many cases the given numbers are based on some rough estimations from absorption spectroscopy or on bulk values. On the other hand, this information is crucial for the application of these nanocrystals in optoelectronics. Therefore, the comprehensive investigation of electronic properties is required, both theoretically and experimentally. Experimental techniques comprise for example electrochemical methods, X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS-UPS).
(4) In terms of solar cell applications, the title compounds contribute to the development of novel “inks” of absorbing materials with precisely controlled properties, compatible with low cost and low temperature solution based processing techniques. The design of appropriate heterojunctions, control of interfaces and improvement of charge extraction are the main points of actual research. The problem of insulating surface ligands can be overcome by taking advantage of recent developments in the passivation of nanocrystals by small molecular ligands or simple ions. Applications relying on the emission properties of the nanocrystals, like LEDs and biological labeling, would strongly benefit from the reduction of the photoluminescence line width, which is for all reported systems at least on the order of 100 nm FWHM. To achieve this goal, synthesis methods are required providing the precise control of the nanocrystal size as well as the composition and crystal structure, and hence of internal and surface defects.

 	Fig. 9  TEM image of Cu2ZnGeSe4 nanocrystals. The insets show an atomic model of the tetrahedral particle, a higher-magnification TEM micrograph, and a histogram with the particle size distribution. Reprinted with permission from ref. 127. © 2012 American Chemical Society.	 

 	Fig. 10  Scheme of the possible relaxation pathways in ternary and quaternary nanocrystals. Band edge emission (PL1) is generally not observed due to the rapid relaxation of excited carriers to surface or internal defects, from which different desexcitation paths are possible (PL2, PL3), including DAP recombinations.
