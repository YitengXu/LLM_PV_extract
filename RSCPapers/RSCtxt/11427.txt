    , Accepted 13th April 2018First published on 13th April 2018AbstractLaser interference ablation in silicon using femto-, pico-, and nanosecond pulses was investigated. The experimental and computational results provide information about nanoscale thermal diffusion during the ultra-short laser–matter interaction. The temperature modulation depth was introduced as a parameter for quality assessment of laser interference ablation. Based on the experiments and calculations, a new semi-empirical formula which combines the interference period with the laser pulse duration, the thermal modulation depth and the thermal diffusivity of the material was derived. This equation is in excellent agreement with the experimental and modelling results of laser interference ablation. This new formula can be used for selecting the appropriate pulse duration for periodical structuring with the required resolution and quality.
1. Introduction
Efficient and precise texturing of silicon is a critical process in many applications of modern technologies especially for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices,1,2 plasmonic colours3–7 and solar cells.8–10 Several techniques are commonly used to pattern the surfaces of semiconductors such as chemical etching, nanoimprinting,11,12 electron beam lithography,13 reactive ion etching14 and laser beam patterning.15–21 However, all these techniques are time-consuming and hardly acceptable for the real industrial batch production. The patterning speed can be enhanced using laser interference ablation (LIA).8,22 This technique allows fast and large area periodical structuring. The principle of LIA is based on the interference of coherent laser beams which forms a periodically modulated laser intensity pattern23 which interacts with a material.24 Within this interaction, the energy transmitted to the matter is later converted to heat, which induces ablation of the irradiated material. The mechanism of the laser–matter interaction depends on the type of the target material (metal, semiconductor, or dielectric), the ablation environment (vacuum, gas, or liquid), and the laser parameters (pulse duration, irradiation wavelength, fluence, pulse repetition rate, number of pulses, and beam profile).25
The laser pulse duration is a critical parameter in the controllable formation of fine periodic structures with a sub-micron resolution by LIA. The highest possible spatial resolution of ultra-fine LIA is determined by thermal diffusion. The heat is transferred between the interference maximum and minimum positions during the laser heating process. Thus, the whole surface can reach a temperature above the melting point if the pulse duration is too long. Therefore, all processed area is melted, and fine periodic structures cannot be formed. The way to avoid this is to use laser pulses with ultra-short durations in order to minimise the laser–matter interaction time and to maintain “cold” areas at the interference minima. At “hot” spots collocated with the interference maxima, material ablation takes place, and a periodic array of fine dimples is created.
There are many scientific studies on LIA.26–33 In several papers, the minimum and maximum temperatures at the positions of the interference minima and maxima have been evaluated for particular pulse durations.34,35 However, there is no scientific work dedicated to the fundamental law on the influence of the laser pulse duration on the smallest achievable feature size and spatial resolution of the LIA. The main purpose of this work is to find an analytical equation defining the interference period and laser pulse duration for ultra-fine periodical LIA.
In this research, a simple analytical recipe for choosing the duration of the laser pulse for ultra-fine LIA is presented. A new semi-empirical equation binding the pulse duration, heat diffusion coefficient and thermal modulation depth for a particular structure period was introduced. The equation was verified by experiments and numerical modelling of LIA. In the experiments, the surface of crystalline silicon was irradiated using a periodically modulated interference beam and a highly periodic array of dimples was ablated. The period between the dimples in the quadratic arrangement was in the sub-micrometre range. Laser sources with different pulse durations (femto-, pico-, and nanoseconds) were tested. The numerical modelling of nanoscale thermal diffusion was performed in order to sustain the semi-empirical equation and experimental results. The derived equation is in good agreement with the numerical simulations and experimental results. The new method developed can be used for selecting a laser source with the right duration of the pulses for periodical interference structuring with the required resolution and quality.
2. Results
2.1. Thermal field simulation of laser interference ablation
The thermal fields in silicon after irradiation by a periodical intensity distribution used in LIA were calculated at the end of the laser pulse (t = τp) because at this time point the whole energy is absorbed and the temperature reaches its maximum value for pico- and nanosecond pulses. However, for femtosecond pulses the situation is different if the electron–phonon relaxation time is longer than the pulse duration τe–ph > τp. The electrons reach thermal equilibrium with the lattice after the end of the femtosecond pulse. Therefore, for estimation of the time point with maximal temperature using femtosecond pulses, the two-temperature model (TTM) should be used. However, for silicon, electrons heated using a laser thermally equilibrate with the lattice on a timescale of τe–ph ∼ 260 fs,36 which is shorter than the femtosecond pulse duration of τp = 300 fs used in our experiment. As a result, the electrons reach a thermal balance with the lattice just before the end of the laser pulse. Consequently, the whole pulse energy absorbed by electrons is transferred to the lattice and the maximal temperature is reached at the end of the laser pulse (t = τp) also for femtosecond pulses and TTM calculations can be avoided. Three-dimensional temperature profiles were plotted for different laser pulse durations (Fig. 1i).
 Fig. 1  Thermal field modelling of laser interference ablation: calculated periodical thermal field (i), experimental SEM micrograph (ii) and calculated phase diagram (iii) of silicon just after the absorbance of laser pulses in laser interference ablation. Pulse durations: (a) 300 fs; (b) 300 ps; and (c) 35 ns. The interference period is Λ4 = 600 nm. In the phase diagram (iii), the colours correspond to different phases of silicon: black – solid, grey – liquid, white – vapour. Tm is the melting point of silicon; Tv is the boiling point of silicon. The vertical and lateral scales are the same, and the dimensions of the computational geometry are 1.8 × 1.8 × 1.6 μm3. 
The modulation depth of the periodical thermal field on the silicon surface after the laser beam interference irradiation was calculated using: (1)where Tmax is the temperature in the hottest spatial position at the interference maximum (Fig. 1i), and Tmin is the temperature in the coolest spatial position at the interference minimum (Fig. 1i). In the case of heating with a femtosecond laser pulse with a duration of 300 fs, the temperature modulation depth is M ≈ 0.99. The large modulation depth is achieved because the absorbed laser energy in the interference peak cannot diffuse into the cold areas, keeping it nearly at room temperature over such a short time span of hundreds of femtoseconds (Fig. 1a-i). In the phase diagram, dimples of vaporized material surrounded by a molten pool are seen (Fig. 1a-iii). The rest of the material is in the solid state. The results of the theoretical modelling are confirmed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrograph of an array of dimples made by femtosecond LIA (Fig. 1a-ii). The dimples are surrounded by small heat affected zones (Fig. 1a-ii). The ridges are not observed in the femtosecond regime (Fig. 1a-ii). In the case of picosecond pulse durations, the thermal field modulation depth is M ≈ 0.9. For a pulse duration of 300 ps, the heat generated in the hot spot of the interference pattern is not capable of diffusing due to the short laser–matter interaction time. Therefore, hot spots are observed in the positions of the interference maxima surrounded by cooler material (Fig. 1b-i). All three phases of silicon are observed, evaporated silicon from laser ablated dimples, surrounded by a doughnut of molten material (Fig. 1b-iii). This was confirmed by an experimental SEM micrograph of ablated silicon obtained by picosecond LIA (Fig. 1b-ii). The shallow dimples surrounded by ridges of re-solidified silicon. The remaining large part of silicon remains in a solid phase. For a nanosecond pulse duration of 35 ns, the modulation depth of the thermal field is small (M ≈ 0.1) because the heat generated at the interference maximum position on the periodical intensity distribution dissipates to the interference minimum position during the laser interaction time with the matter. Therefore, the almost all irradiated volume of silicon has a high temperature above the melting point (Fig. 1c-i) and is in the liquid form (Fig. 1c-iii). No evaporation of the material is observed because of high thermal losses in the hot maximum position due to thermal diffusion. The experimental evidence of all re-solidified surface is a SEM micrograph (Fig. 1c-ii). However, some ablation in the positions of the interference maximum is also seen.
2.2. Thermal modulation depth of a periodical temperature field induced by pulsed laser interference ablation (LIA)
The temperature fields for different periods of LIA were calculated for various pulse durations (see the Methods section). The maximum Tmax and minimum temperatures Tmin were taken from the hottest and coolest points of the calculated thermal fields, as shown in Fig. 1i. The thermal modulation depth M was computed using eqn (1) from numerical data of thermal fields. The calculated thermal modulation depth versus pulse duration at different LIA periods is given in Fig. 2a. The thermal modulation depth decreases with increasing duration of the laser pulse at fixed LIA periods. For larger periods a high thermal modulation depth is reached with the given pulse duration, as the heat has gone a longer distance. The calculated thermal modulation depth versus interference period at different pulse durations is given in Fig. 2b. The thermal modulation depth increases with increasing interference period at fixed pulse durations. For shorter laser pulses a higher thermal modulation depth is reached at a given interference period.
 Fig. 2  (a) Thermal modulation depth versus pulse duration at different interference periods. (b) Thermal modulation depth versus interference period at different pulse durations. (c) Interference period versus pulse duration at different ablation qualities. Dependence of the period of laser interference ablation on the laser pulse duration: letters [a], [b], and [c] in white squares correspond to experimentally tested points given in Fig. 3. The regions marked with various grey colours represent the three quality categories of LIA: white – ultra-fine ablation, M > 0.96; light grey – ablation and melting, 0.96 > M > 0.4; dark grey – melting M < 0.4. The cyan arrow in (c) shows the direction of increasing thermal modulation depth and its related LIA quality. Solid dots – calculated data using eqn (4)–(7); solid lines – fit of the calculated data points using the semi-empirical eqn (2) in (a and b) and eqn (3) in (c). 
It is known that the thermal diffusion length during the laser heating shows a dependence of (αdiff·τp)1/2,37–39 where αdiff = 1.0 cm2 s−1 is the thermal diffusion coefficient for silicon,40 and τp is the pulse duration. However, there is no equation found in the scientific literature describing how thermal diffusion behaves in a periodical two-dimensional pattern. Therefore, in this work, a new semi-empirical expression was derived for thermal modulation depth in LIA, taking into account that heat has to travel distance from interference minimum to interference maximum positions: (2)The relationship between the thermal modulation depth, the LIA period, the thermal diffusivity of material and the pulse duration is defined by the new analytical formula. Eqn (2) was applied to fit calculated data points in Fig. 2a and b. The new semi-empirical equation coincides well with the modelling results.
The calculated period of LIA versus pulse duration at different thermal modulation depths for silicon is given in Fig. 2c. The regions of different LIA qualities are separated by the lines of the log–log scale plot in Fig. 2c. Eqn (2) can be rewritten for calculation of the LIA period Λ4, as a function of thermal modulation depth and its related fabrication qualities: (3)Eqn (3) was applied to fit calculated data points in Fig. 2c by solid isoclines that correspond to the fixed level of thermal modulation depths of M = 0.4 and M = 0.96. The new semi-empirical equation is in a perfect agreement with the modelling results.
2.3. Quality characterization of LIA
The minimum modulation depth required to have a highly regular periodic and controllable structure in the material after LIA is when some part of the material is ablated (Tmax ≥ Tv = 3538 K), and some areas of silicon remain solid (Tmin ≤ Tm = 1687 K).41 The minimum modulation depth for the silicon sample is Mmin = (Tv − Tm)/(Tv + Tm) = 0.4. The thermal modulation depths of the LIA were classified into three regions: ultrafine-ablation, ablation and melting, and melting. The melting occurs for the modulation below the critical value M < Mmin = 0.4. Therefore, all the surface of the laser-irradiated sample is melted and no solid material is left. The ablation and melting occur in the thermal modulation depth range of 0.96 > M > 0.4. In this case, a large percentage of the materials is vaporized and melted. During the laser–matter interaction time, not much of the heat can be transferred from the hot points to the cold areas. Therefore, a large portion of the material is kept in the solid state. In order to achieve “ultrafine-ablation”, the temperature modulation depth should be as high as M > 0.96. In this case, the interference minimum spots are kept at room temperature. This allows producing an array of ablated dimples surrounded by solid material which is not affected thermally. In the particular case when the interference period is Λ4 = 600 nm, ultra-short laser pulses with the pulse duration τp < 5 ps are needed to achieve “ultra-fine ablation”.
Over such a short time span of several picoseconds, the heat from the hot place is not able to diffuse even short distances of sub-micrometres. The LIA experiments on silicon were performed in order to verify the new semi-empirical eqn (2) and (3) and computing results.
SEM images and atomic force microscopy (AFM) three-dimensional images and depth profiles of the silicon surface after LIA are given in Fig. 3. The ultra-fine ablation is seen in micrographs for the experiments performed using a femtosecond laser with a pulse duration of 300 fs in the array of dimples with a period of 600 nm presented in Fig. 3a. The heat-affected zone is minimal (Fig. 3a). The ablation and melting were achieved when the pulse duration was increased to 300 ps (Fig. 3b). The ridges of the molten metal around the dimples are seen in the micrographs. The nano-bump in the centre of the dimple is also observed in some of the dimples (Fig. 3b). The nano-bump formation has been observed for a gold thin film using a femtosecond laser42 and in interference patterning.43–46 Nano-bumps have also been observed on silicon by picosecond vortex beam irradiation,47 near-field enhanced laser irradiation,48,49 and direct nanosecond laser patterning,50 and linear nano-grooves by scanned nanosecond fibre laser irradiation.49 The formation of the nano-bump array by picosecond LIA on silicon has been observed for the first time in this work. The formation mechanism of the nano-bump array on silicon is still an open question. Dimples with depths of ∼55 nm, ∼35 nm and ∼5 nm were achieved for LIA with the corresponding pulse durations of 300 fs, 300 ps and 35 ns (Fig. 3 bottom). The AFM image provided in Fig. 3c indicates nano-dimples fabricated by a 35 ns pulse with a depth of around 5 nm. Visually, the SEM image (Fig. 3c top) shows that the dimples look deeper than the measured depth of ∼5 nm (Fig. 3c bottom). The structural changes of the silicon could be recorded using a secondary electron detector in SEM micrographs. This has a visual effect on the high-intensity interference peaks as the dimples look deeper than those indicated in the AFM profile (Fig. 3c bottom). There is no vaporization in silicon according to simulation results given in Fig. 1c-iii. However, we see some small periodical nanodimples on AFM images provided in Fig. 3c (middle, bottom) after 35 ns pulse irradiation. The dimples in the interference peaks might have occurred due to the Marangoni effect also called thermo-capillary convection.51,52 The surface tension of molten silicon is a temperature dependent parameter.53 As a result, molten silicon exhibits large temperature gradients and their related surface tension gradients in the nanosecond LIA. The surface tension of molten silicon is lower in the interference maximum (hotter area) and is higher in the interference minimum (colder area). The molten silicon is dragged from interference maximum to minimum positions due to the higher surface tension. Over the time span of tens of nanoseconds, the molten silicon exhibits transformations before it solidifies, thus leaving nanodimples without vaporization of the material.
 Fig. 3  SEM and AFM analysis of laser interference ablation. The SEM micrographs (top) and three-dimensional AFM images (middle) and AFM depth profiles (bottom) of the silicon surface after LIA. Pulse durations: (a) τp = 300 fs; (b) τp = 300 ps; and (c) τp = 35 ns. Interference period Λ4 = 600 nm; peak laser fluence in the interference maxima Φ0 = 8.1 J cm−2. The micrographs correspond to the data points marked by letters in Fig. 2. The insets on the bottom left corners of the SEM micrographs are 10 times enlarged areas of one interference period. 
The depths of the measured dimples from AFM profiles in Fig. 3 (bottom) do not exactly match the data from a simulation where the temperature exceeds the boiling point in Fig. 1-iii. However, the measured dimple depth from the experiment is proportional to those obtained from simulation results. The mismatch coefficient is about ∼3 (dimple depth obtained from the AFM image in Fig. 3 (bottom) is about 3 times smaller than that obtained from simulation (Fig. 1-iii)). The reason for this might be the fixed absorption coefficient value used in numerical calculations. The absorption coefficient shows a strong dependence on temperature for silicon.54 However, no analytical expression of the absorption coefficient versus temperature for silicon has been found in any scientific literature for 532 nm wavelength. Therefore, a fixed absorption coefficient value55 has been used in the numerical calculation, which might have led to the mismatch.
3. Methods
3.1. Experimental
Experiments were conducted using three laser irradiation sources (NL220, Ekspla; Atlantic HE, Ekspla; and Pharos, Light Conversion) with different pulse durations of 35 ns, 300 ps and 300 fs, respectively. Close irradiation wavelengths of 532 nm and 515 nm and a pulse repetition rate of 1 kHz were used in the tests with all three laser sources. The classical 4-f system was used in the experimental setup, well defined in our previous work dedicated to LIA.19 The laser beam was split into four beams using a diffractive optical element. The beams were directed on the sample surface using a 4-f optical imaging system made of two convex lenses. The period of the LIA depends on two parameters of the experimental setup: the wavelength of irradiation and the angle of the interfering laser beam. It is defined by the classical equation, given in our previous work.19 The combined laser beams produced a sinusoidal type of periodical interference intensity distribution on the polished surface of the mono-crystalline silicon wafer. The period of the periodically modulated intensity distribution was 600 nm. The sample was irradiated using a single laser pulse.
The ablation threshold fluence for silicon depends on the pulse duration.56 Therefore, different laser fluences close to the ablation threshold for all three laser sources with pulse durations of 35 ns, 300 ps and 300 fs should be used in order to have comparable results. However, a variation of laser fluence would lead to big differences of absorbed laser energy for nano-, pico- and femtosecond pulse durations in numerical modelling and it would provide incomparable results. Therefore, we used exactly the same laser fluence in numerical modelling and its subsequent experiments in order to have the same absorbed laser energy for all different pulse durations. The peak laser fluence in the interference maxima was chosen as 8.1 J cm−2 for all three laser sources with different pulse durations. The selected fluence provides the maximum possible ablation efficiency for silicon.57 To achieve selected laser fluence in experiments, the laser pulse energy was set to 2 mJ, and the laser interference spot radius was set to 250 μm, for all three laser sources. Exactly identical to experimental processing parameters were used in numerical modelling provided in Table 2.
The surface topography was studied using SEM (EVO 50 EP, Carl Zeiss SMT AG). The height profiles were measured using AFM (Edge Dimension, Veeco).
3.2. Thermal field calculations
Many physical phenomena are involved in laser ablation using different pulse durations (femto-, pico- and nanoseconds): a reflection of laser irradiation from the surface and Beer–Lambert–Bouguer absorption; heat diffusion, phase transition, plasma shielding, thermo-capillary convection, electron–lattice thermalization, hot electron diffusion, etc. All of them have to be included in modelling in order to have a precise description of experimental conditions. However, many of the physical phenomena can be eliminated as not having a major influence on the LIA process. Only heat diffusion plays a crucial role in LIA especially when the fabrication period goes down to the sub-micrometre range. Therefore, the influence of thermal diffusion in the nanoscale LIA regime and the phenomenological model are presented in this work. Short discussions on the elimination of negligible phenomena are given below.
There are two regimes of material ablation depending on whether the laser pulse duration is shorter or longer than the electron–phonon relaxation time, which can vary from a fraction of a picosecond to tens of picoseconds depending on the thermo-physical properties of the target material.58 For silicon, primary photo-excited electron–hole pairs (momentum scattering) decay in ≪100 fs, whereas charge carriers equilibrate with the lattice on a timescale of τe–ph ∼ 200–300 fs.19,36,59–65 When the laser pulse duration is longer than the energy relaxation time, a thermodynamic equilibrium between the lattice and the electrons is reached during the laser–matter interaction time. This leads to the heating and thermal modification of the material if the cooling rate of the irradiated area is smaller than the energy deposition rate.25 When the laser pulse duration is shorter than the energy relaxation time, non-equilibrium between the electrons and the lattice occurs, and it leads to non-thermal modification of the material as the laser pulse disappears before the transfer of photon energy to the lattice.66 In this case, the heat affected zone is significantly smaller than those for longer laser pulses as the energy has no time to dissipate into the material. For this reason, more precise and pure laser processing can be achieved. However, for thermal calculation, a complex and time consuming TTM is needed.60,61 Nevertheless, the complicated TTM has reliably been replaced by classical heat conduction calculation even for femtosecond pulses with a duration of 350 fs at a wavelength of 515 nm and a fluence of 0.52 J cm−2.67 This has been achieved by creating an integrated model where the experimentally-determined absorption coefficient has been replaced by the numerically-determined absorption coefficient and using the classical heat conduction equation.
The ultrafast cooling of a silicon tip lattice after femtosecond (50 fs) laser irradiation with the characteristic cooling time of 1.7 ps experimentally measured and theoretically calculated is reported in ref. 64. It confirmed that energy is transferred to the lattice by charge carriers in a time scale of 240 fs and lattice cooling can occur in a time scale of 1.7 ps.
In our work, the thermal field calculation was carried out up to pulse durations larger than electron–phonon relaxation time τp ≥ τe–ph in order to avoid the TTM. In the case of our experiment, the shortest pulse duration of 300 fs was used, which is larger than the electron–phonon relaxation time for silicon and the TTM was not needed. Moreover, we did not want to overcrowd our calculation with the equations of the TTM and the physical parameters of silicon required for the TTM. We used a simple heat transfer equation with a heat source of absorbed laser power density. In our case, the femtosecond pulse duration τp = 300 fs is longer than the phonon–electron relaxation time τe–ph ∼ 260 fs36 for silicon. Thus, our approach gives reliable accuracy for temperature field calculations.
The ambipolar diffusion of hot electrons just after absorbing a periodically modulated interference intensity pattern might result in broadening of the smallest feature size before reaching thermal equilibrium with the lattice. A similar effect of ablation area dependence on the pulse duration for silicon is analysed for ultrashort pulses with a duration from 0.2 ps to 6 ps in ref. 68. The transverse size of energy deposited into the material is defined by Ldep ≈ (wfoc2 + 4αdiffa·τ)1/2,68,69 where wfoc is the size of the focused beam spot on the sample, αdiffa is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient, and τ is the irradiation time. The silicon film was irradiated using a Gaussian beam with spot radius wfoc ≈ 2.0 μm, and an experimentally measured ablated radius of wabl ≈ 2.1 μm (size increase due to ambipolar diffusion of ∼0.1 μm) for a pulse duration of ∼0.3 ps was reported in ref. 68. This effect of ambipolar diffusion might decrease the thermal modulation depth in LIA if not taken into account. Therefore, we compare the hot electron diffusion length scale with our LIA period in the femtosecond case. The lower bound of the electron ambipolar diffusion coefficient at room temperature is αdiffa ≈ 30 cm2 s−169–71 and the upper bound at high temperatures is αdiffa ≈ 1 × 103 cm2 s−168 for silicon. On the other hand, the lattice thermal diffusion coefficient is αdiffl ≈ 1.0 cm2 s−1 for silicon.40,72 The electrons heated by laser pulses diffuse about αdiffa/αdiffl = 1000 times more rapidly than heat spreads by the lattice. For our case of pulse duration of 300 fs, the broadening of interference maxima due to electron diffusion lengths are calculated similarly to the equation given in ref. 68 and 69 is Ldiff ≈ (Λ42 + 4αdiffa·τp)1/2 − Λ4 ≈ 93 nm, where Λ4 = 600 nm is the interference period, and τp = 300 fs is the pulse duration. This hot electron diffusion length during laser irradiation using femtosecond pulses is Λ4/Ldiff ≈ 6.5 times smaller than that of the interference period. Consequently, the hot electron diffusivity does not affect the thermal pattern of the lattice and can be assumed as negligible. The TTM is not necessary for our shortest pulse of 300 fs.
The interaction of the incoming laser beam with plasma and ablation by plasma play important roles especially for nanosecond pulses and even for femtosecond pulses. However, the energy loss because plasma shielding is less than 1% at the point of the most efficient ablation at a fluence of 8.1 J cm−2 (laser pulse duration of 100 fs, wavelength of 800 nm) for silicon was reported in ref. 57 and can be neglected. An ablation depth decrease of ∼22% due to the plasma shielding effect for nanosecond laser ablation at 9 J cm−2 (pulse duration of 3–25 ns, wavelength of 248–266 nm) for silicon was reported in ref. 73 and it can also be neglected. Therefore, for the simplicity of thermal field calculations, the plasma shielding has not been taken into account.
The main idea proposed in this work is to find a general law of LIA and to keep our calculations as simple as possible. We used the simple heat transfer equation with a heat source of absorbed laser power per unit volume in our simplified model. This type of simplified model has already been used for a wide range of pulse durations: femto-,74 pico-,75,76 nanosecond,77–79 and ultra-short80,81 laser pulses. This proves that the simplified model is valid for all different peak intensities of laser irradiation with some tolerance.
The temperature field dynamics in semi-infinite bulk silicon irradiated by the laser beam interference were investigated by numerically solving the heat transfer equation. The laser radiation is partially reflected from the silicon surface. The remaining laser radiation is absorbed by silicon. Later, the absorbed laser radiation is converted to heat. The time-dependent temperature distribution T = T(t, x, y, z) is governed by the heat transfer equation in the three-dimensional form, which is appropriate to many experimental situations:79 (4)where ρ is the density, Cp is the specific heat, Lm is the latent heat of fusion, T is the temperature, Tm is the melting point, Lv is the latent heat of vaporization, Tv is the boiling point, t is the time, κ is the thermal conductivity and Q is the absorbed laser power per unit volume. Taking into account reflection from the surface and Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law, the heat source can be defined by: Q = (1 − Rλ)αΦ/τp rect(1 − τp)exp(−αz),(5)where Rλ is the reflectivity, α is the absorption coefficient, z is the longitudinal spatial coordinate and τp is the pulse duration. The step-like temporal profile of the laser pulse is described by a rectangular function. Φ = Φ(x, y) is the periodically modulated laser energy density distribution defined in the interference field by:82 (6)where x and y are the transverse spatial coordinates, Φ0 = 8Ep/(πw02) is the peak laser fluence in the centre of the four-beam interference field, Ep is the laser pulse energy, and Λ4 is the four-beam interference period. The terms Lmδ(T − Tm) and Lvδ(T − Tv) in eqn (4) allow performing a simulation of the solid–liquid and liquid–vapour interfaces. The δ-function was approximated as:79 (7)with the parameter ΔT in the 100–200 K range depending on the temperature gradient (the defined domain of the δ-function should be greater than three computational cells). The sign of the δ-function depends on the motion direction of the solid–liquid interface (i.e. whether melting or solidification takes place in the target).
The model presented in our work by eqn (4)–(7) takes into account the following physical phenomena: reflection of laser irradiation from the surface, Beer–Lambert–Bouguer absorption of laser irradiation, periodical interference intensity profiling, three-dimensional heat diffusion, thermal processing via solid–liquid–vapour transitions, and temperature dependence of thermal and optical properties.
The model defined by eqn (4)–(7) does not take into account the following physical phenomena: laser irradiation absorption by electrons and its transfer to the lattice described by the TTM; ambipolar diffusion of electron–hole plasma; electron–phonon coupling resulting in delayed Auger recombination and heating; broadening of the multi-beam interference patterns due to ambipolar diffusion after laser energy deposition via photo-excitation of dense electron–hole plasma; spallation temperature, rather than vaporization temperature; plasma shielding; thermo-capillary convection; recoil pressure ablation; Coulomb explosion; and absorption coefficient dependence on temperature.
The laser beam was approximated to the Gaussian profile in the lateral x- and y-directions and its modulation with the period Λ4 in both spatial transverse directions due to interference. The Gaussian decay of the intensity was not taken into account because w0 ≫ Λ4 in the computational domain. The physical parameters of silicon used in numerical calculations are given in Table 1. The computer-aided design (CAD) geometry of a square prism with the base lengths of X = Y and height of Z was designed. The parameters of irradiation and the CAD geometry used in the computations are given in Table 2. Eqn (4)–(7) were solved numerically using finite element analysis software (COMSOL Multiphysics, COMSOL Inc.).

4. Conclusions
The nanoscale thermal diffusion in laser interference ablation was investigated in this work. The temperature modulation depth was introduced as a parameter to evaluate ablation quality. A new semi-empirical equation binding the pulse duration, heat diffusion coefficient and thermal modulation depth for a particular structure period of laser interference ablation was introduced. The experiments and modelling of the laser interference ablation were performed in order to verify the new semi-empirical equation. The surface of crystalline silicon was irradiated by a periodically modulated interference beam and a periodic array of dimples was ablated. Three laser sources with pulse durations of femto-, pico-, and nanoseconds were tested. The numerical modelling of the nanoscale thermal diffusion during the laser–matter interaction time was performed. The derived equation is in good agreement with the numerical simulation and experimental results. The new discovered formula can be used for selecting the laser source with the required duration of the pulses for periodical interference structuring with the required resolution and quality.
