    , Accepted 23rd December 2019First published on 24th December 2019AbstractTwo conjugated donor polymers (PB2F-Cl and PB2F-2Cl) based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione with asymmetrical and symmetrical chlorinated thiophene-bridges were designed and synthesized. Both polymers exhibited extremely deep HOMO levels of −5.50 and −5.56 eV for PB2F-Cl and PB2F-2Cl, respectively. Although PB2F-Cl had a more planar conjugated backbone, PB2F-Cl exhibited a weaker aggregation behaviour than PB2F-2Cl in chlorobenzene solution due to its regioirregular conjugated backbone. After blending with an IT-4F acceptor, the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F film exhibited a slightly stronger lamellar stacking and a weaker π stacking compared to the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F film as confirmed by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. In PSCs, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F-based PSC was 10.81%, while the PCE of the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F-based PSC reached 12.79%.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention due to their unique advantages of low-cost production, light weight, flexibility and semi-transparency.1–4 In recent years, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have increased rapidly benefiting from the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs).5–7 These successful NFAs, like ITIC,6 Y67 and their derivatives,8–11 exhibited strong and broad absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, high electron mobilities, and low voltage loss in the resulting devices.12,13 To achieve better PCEs in PSCs, the active layer, which is composed of one polymer donor and one NFA, has to exhibit maximized solar photons and minimized voltage losses, providing high circuit-current densities (JSC) and open-circuit voltages (VOC) in the resulting photovoltaic devices, therefore, the corresponding polymer donor requires a broad absorption spectrum at short wavelength and deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels. According to the current rules of molecular design, the polymer donor can easily show suitable energy levels and absorption spectra to match the high performance NFAs.14–18 However, the well-matched energy levels and absorption spectra between the polymer donor and NFA cannot always produce satisfactory PCEs, because NFAs possess anisotropic charge carrier transporting properties due to their planar conjugated backbones, and it is hard to form nanoscale bi-continuous phase separation morphologies with polymer donors.19,20 Favourable BHJ morphologies in NF PSCs are of vital importance to achieve efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in NF PSCs. The aggregation properties of polymer donors have been proved to have a big influence on molecular self-organization and BHJ morpholines,21–23 therefore, the development of a new strategy to control polymer donors’ aggregation is an important and challenging topic for the achievement of high-performance PSCs.
Fluorine (F) atoms were widely used in organic semiconductors to enhance molecular planarity, decrease the molecular energy level, tune the molecular aggregation and optimize BHJ morphology, thus yielding outstanding mobilities and PCEs in organic field-effect transistors and PSCs, respectively.24–28 In contrast, chlorine (Cl) atoms are less electronegative (3.16), and have a larger van der Waals radius (1.75 Å) and empty d-orbitals. These features endowed chlorine-substituted organic semiconductors with unique opto-electronic properties in electronics. For instance, compared to their fluorinated counterparts, chlorinated conjugated polymers have deeper HOMO levels,29,30 and chlorinated NFAs exhibit a red-shift in the absorption spectra.31,32 More importantly, the synthesis of chlorinated monomers is much easier and involves a lower cost than that of the fluorinated counterparts. Therefore, the study and development of chlorinated photovoltaic materials is an important topic in the field of PSCs.
Previously, we investigated chlorinated thiophene orientation in conjugated polymers.33 The PCl(3)BDB-T:IT-4F-based device exhibited a negligible power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.18%, due to the large twisted angles (62° and 63°) between chlorinated thiophene and the benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) unit. The PCl(4)BDBT:IT-4F-based device showed a PCE of 12.33%, because of the small twisted angles (26° and 23°) between chlorinated thiophene and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT). Due to the larger size of the Cl atom, the introduction of a Cl atom into the conjugated backbone will increase the torsion of the resulting polymers. To further investigate the influence of chlorinated thiophene as π bridges in conjugated backbones on polymer geometries, aggregation and photovoltaic performances, in this work, we designed and synthesized two conjugated polymers (PB2F-Cl and PB2F-2Cl, Chart 1), which were the only difference in π-linkers between fluorinated BDT and BDD units. This minor difference made both polymers have distinct conjugated backbone geometries, which had a big effect on their aggregation properties in solution and organization in films. In PSCs, the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F-based device showed a PCE of 10.81%, while the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F-based device showed a better PCE of 12.79%.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of two polymers is shown in Scheme 1. 1,3-Dibromo-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (1),34 (3-chloro-5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)triisopropylsilane (2)33 and monomer 733 were prepared according to previous work. The asymmetrical chlorinated compound 4 was synthesized via a two-step Stille coupling from compound 1 with compound 2 and tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane successively. Afterwards, the triisopropylsilane group was removed to obtain compound 5via tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF). The desired monomer 6 was obtained using fresh lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and carbon tetrabromide. The Stille coupling reaction was carried out again to prepare both polymers (PB2F-Cl and PB2F-2Cl) between monomer 6 or 7 and tin compound 8. Both polymers have good solubility in chloroform, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, etc. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of PB2F-Cl and PB2F-2Cl were estimated to be 14.8 and 15.8 kg mol−1 with a polydispersity index (Đ) of 3.0 and 3.5, respectively, by the GPC method using polystyrene as the standard and o-dichlorobenzene as the eluent at 145 °C (Table 1). Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was used to measure the thermal properties of both polymers as shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†). Both polymers exhibit good thermal stability, with 5% weight loss at the same temperature of 385 °C.

Optical and electrochemical properties and quantum chemistry calculations
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of both polymers are recorded in diluted chlorobenzene solutions and films, respectively. The corresponding data are provided in Table 1. In diluted chlorobenzene solutions (20 °C) as shown in Fig. 1, PB2F-Cl shows 0–0 absorption at 618 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 7.1 × 10−4 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. S2a, ESI†) and two shoulder peaks as 0–1 and 0–2 at 576 and 360 nm, respectively. After introducing another Cl atom into the thiophene bridge, PB2F-2Cl exhibits a bathochromic shift and enhancement of 0–0 absorption peak at 640 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 8.2 × 10−4 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. S2a, ESI†), the corresponding shoulder peaks are 0–1 and 0–2 at 580 and 360 nm, respectively. This result implies that PB2F-2Cl shows a stronger intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the electron-donating and electron-accepting units along the conjugated backbone than PB2F-Cl,35,36 which could be attributed to more chlorine atoms in PB2F-2Cl. Additionally, we also employed a variable temperature UV-vis spectrophotometer to investigate their aggregation behaviours in diluted chlorobenzene as shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†). When the solution temperature is heated to 100 °C, the absorption intensity of the 0–0 peak in PB2F-Cl is lower than that of 0–1, but this phenomenon does not occur in chlorobenzene solution of PB2F-2Cl. This suggests that PB2F-2Cl shows a stronger aggregation in solution compared to PB2F-Cl. In films, PB2F-Cl and PB2F-2Cl show a redshift of the 0–0 peak at 626 nm and a blue-shift of the 0–0 peak at 625 nm, respectively, compared to their corresponding absorption in solution. Such an absorption feature in PB2F-2Cl was not observed in previously reported PBDB-T analogues.30,33,37 The optical bandgaps of both polymers are calculated to be 1.84 and 1.92 eV for PB2F-Cl and PB2F-2Cl, respectively, according to the onset absorption in films.

The HOMO/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PB2F-Cl and PB2F-2Cl were estimated to be −5.50/−3.52 eV and −5.56/−3.58 eV, respectively, by carrying out cyclic voltammetry measurements (Fig. 2a). To understand the influence of chlorinated thiophene-bridges on the torsion of conjugated backbones, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on donor–acceptor–donor (O1 and O2) of both polymers with methyl substituents.38 As shown in Fig. 2b, the optimal conformation of O1 shows twisted angles of 5.7°, 11.6°, 13.1° and 17.3° respectively. After the introduction of another chlorinated thiophene as the π-bridge, the O2 exhibits corresponding twisted angles of 17.9°, 11.6°, 12.2° and 22.0° respectively. This result implies that PB2F-Cl has a more planar conjugated backbone compared to PB2F-2Cl. This could be one of the reasons that PB2F-Cl has a slight redshifted absorption spectrum compared to PB2F-2Cl in films.

Photovoltaic performances
We used IT-4F (see Fig. S1b, ESI†) as an electron acceptor to evaluate the photovoltaic performances of both polymer donors. A device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:IT-4F/PFN-Br/Al was employed to fabricate PSCs. The devices were optimized by changing the donor/acceptor weight ratios (w/w), 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) volume ratios (v/v) and thermal annealing temperatures for the active layers (Tables S1–S6, ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices are displayed in Fig. 3a, and the photovoltaic parameters are provided in Table 2. The PB2F-Cl:IT-4F-based PSC gave a PCE of 10.81% with a VOC of 0.904 V, a JSC of 18.98 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 62.98%. While the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F-based PSC yielded a better PCE of 12.79% with a VOC 0.926 V, a JSC of 20.89 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.12%. Such high VOC in the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F-based device is one of the highest values among IT-4F-based PSCs. The different VOC in both optimal PSCs should originate from the offset HOMO levels of both polymers. The different JSC and FF in both optimal PSCs could be attributed to their different BHJ morphologies. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out to estimate the JSC in both devices as shown in Fig. 3b. Both PSCs exhibit the same wavelength range of 300–850 nm, but the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F-based device shows a higher EQE response than the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F-based device. The JSC values integrated from the EQE spectra were calculated to be 18.06 and 20.38 mA cm−2 for the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F and PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F-based devices, respectively, which fitted well with the JSC obtained from the J–V measurements under 5% mismatch.

Charge generation, transport and recombination
To study charge generation in both polymer-based PSCs, we performed experiments to study the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff).39Jph is calculated according to Jph = JL − JD, wherein JL and JD are current densities for illumination and dark conditions, respectively. Veff is defined as the difference between the compensation voltage (V0, determined when Jph = 0) and the applied voltage (V). Jsat stands for the saturated photocurrent density. Under the short-circuit condition, the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss = Jph/Jsat) is used to evaluate charge generation. Fig. 4 shows the profiles of Jphversus Veff for both polymer-based PSCs. The PB2F-Cl:IT-4F and PB2F-2Cl-based devices yield a Pdiss of 89.62% and 91.35%, respectively. This suggests that the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F-based PSC has more efficient exciton dissociations compared to the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F-based PSC, which is consistent with EQE measurements.

Due to the asymmetrical and symmetrical chlorinated thiophene-bridges in both polymers, PB2F-Cl has a planar but regioirregular conjugated backbone, PB2F-2Cl has a twisted but regioirregular conjugated backbone. To clarify which one is beneficial for charge transport in blended films, we further employed space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) measurements as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†).40 The corresponding data are summarized in Table S7 (ESI†). The PB2F-Cl:IT-4F film shows hole and electron mobilities of 5.35 × 10−6 and 3.05 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, while the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F film shows hole and electron mobilities of 1.45 × 10−5 and 1.19 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Although the electron mobility of the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F film is higher than that of the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F film, the hole mobility of the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F film is much lower than that of the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F film. More importantly, the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F film shows more balanced electron and hole mobilities than the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F film. In combination with the Pdiss of both devices, this is one of the reasons why the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F based device has a higher JSC and FF than the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F-based device.
The light intensity (Plight) dependent VOC and JSC were obtained to further understand the charge recombination mechanism of both optimal PSC devices as shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†).41–44 The slope of VOCvs. Plight is used to distinguish the recombination dynamics, the slopes of kT/q and 2kT/q stand for bimolecular and monomolecular recombination, respectively. The PB2F-Cl:IT-4F and PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F-based PSCs show slopes of 1.47 and 1.36 kT/q, respectively. These results imply that both devices tend to show bimolecular recombination, but the monomolecular recombination cannot be ignored. The relationship between JSC and Plight can be described as JSC ∝ (Plight)S, where the exponential factor S represents the degree of bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. S4b (ESI†), the S values are 0.96 and 0.98 for PB2F-Cl:IT-4F and PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F-based PSCs, respectively. These results indicate that both polymer-based PSCs show weak bimolecular recombination. Briefly, both polymer-based devices show very weak bimolecular recombination, but a slightly stronger monomolecular recombination in the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F-based device could be a major reason for the lower JSC and FF in this device compared to the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F-based PSCs.
Morphologies of the blended films
To further understand the different JSC, FF, and charge carrier mobilities in both polymer-based devices, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were also employed to investigate the organization of pure polymers and blend films as shown in Fig. 5. Both the PB2F-Cl and PB2F-2Cl pure films exhibit a preferential face-on orientation, both pure films have the same π–π distance (1.69 Å−1, 0.37 nm) but PB2F-2Cl shows a stronger π stacking ability than PB2F-Cl, as evidenced by the pronounced (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction. Additionally, both pure films display a broad peak at around 0.29 Å−1 (21.7 Å) in both out-of-plane and in-plane directions, which is attributed to the (100) lamellar stacking. To estimate their crystallization ability, we used the Scherrer equation to calculate the corresponding coherence length (CL) by fitting the (100) peaks in both directions.45 The CL of PB2F-Cl (8.4 nm) is slightly larger than that of PB2F-2Cl (7.4 nm). These results imply that PB2F-Cl could have a stronger crystallization ability than PB2F-2Cl. After blending with IT-4F, PB2F-Cl and PB2F-2Cl blends show smaller lamellar and π stacking distances of 20.9 Å (0.30 Å−1) and 0.36 nm (1.74 Å−1) compared to their pure films, respectively. At the same time, the CL of the PB2F-Cl blend (10.9 nm) is slightly larger than that of the PB2F-2Cl blend (10.2 nm), but the π–π stacking of the PB2F-Cl blend is slightly weaker than that of the PB2F-2Cl blend. The large CL in the blend film could form large crystallization sizes, which are not beneficial for exciton dissociation and transportation.46 These results suggest that the PB2F-Cl blend shows a slightly stronger crystallization, but relatively weaker charge transfer abilities compared to the PB2F-2Cl blend. These minor differences could be attributed to their unique molecular geometries. This is why PB2F-Cl:IT-4F has a low hole charge carrier mobility, thus yielding slightly low JSC and FF in the resulting PSCs.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were employed to investigate the surface morphologies of pure polymers and blend films as shown in Fig. 6. In pure films, PB2F-Cl shows a larger crystallization size than PB2F-2Cl. Additionally, PB2F-Cl exhibits a significantly large root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 4.34 nm compared to PB2F-2Cl (1.90 nm). This could be attributed to the strong crystallization of PB2F-Cl due to its more planar conjugated backbone. In blend films, the RMS of the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F film increases to 4.68 nm, while the RMS of the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F film increased to 2.05 nm due to the larger crystallization sizes in the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F film. The large crystallization size in BHJ is not beneficial for exciton dissociation and transportation, thus yielding a low JSC and FF.

Conclusions
In summary, we reported two conjugated polymers, PB2F-Cl and PB2F-2Cl, with asymmetrical and symmetrical chlorinated thiophene bridges. In comparison to the more planar and regioirregular conjugated backbone of PB2F-Cl, PB2F-2Cl had a more twisted and regioregular polymer main chain. Both polymers possessed very deep HOMO energy levels with −5.50 and −5.56 eV for PB2F-Cl and PB2F-2Cl, respectively. Compared to PB2F-Cl, PB2F-2Cl showed a stronger aggregation ability in solution and charge transport ability in the film, but weaker crystallization ability in a film as confirmed by UV absorption and GIWAXS studies. In blends, the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F film exhibited a slightly big RMS (4.68 nm) and possessed unbalanced charge carrier mobilities, while the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F film displayed a smooth surface roughness (RMS, 2.05 nm), and possessed balanced charge carrier mobilities. Therefore, the PCE of the PB2F-Cl:IT-4F-based PSC was 10.81%, while the PCE of the PB2F-2Cl:IT-4F-based PSC increased to 12.79%. This work demonstrates that the asymmetrical and symmetrical chlorinated thiophene-bridge in the conjugated backbone plays a critical role in optimizing polymer aggregation, self-organization and BHJ morphologies.
