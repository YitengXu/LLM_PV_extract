    , Accepted 4th February 2019First published on 4th February 2019AbstractThis study reports three newly developed dopant-free hole-transporting materials (HTMs) for perovskite solar cells. The design is based on a quinacridone (QA) dye as the core with three different extended end-capping moieties, namely, acenaphthylene (ACE), triphenylamine (TPA) and diphenylamine (DPA), attached to the QA core. These HTMs were synthesized and used to successfully fabricate in mesoscopic TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM perovskite devices. Under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2, the devices achieved a maximum efficiency of 18.2% for ACE-QA-ACE, 16.6% for TPA-QA-TPA and 15.5% for DPA-QA-DPA without any additives, whereas reference devices with doped spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM achieved a PCE of 15.2%. Notably, the unencapsulated devices based on the novel dopant-free HTMs exhibited impressive stability in comparison with the devices based on doped spiro-OMeTAD under a relative humidity of 75% for 30 days. These linear symmetrical HTMs pave the way to a new class of organic hole-transporting materials for cost-efficient and large-area applications of printed perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Research efforts related to π-conjugated vat dyes and pigments are expanding because of their outstanding properties such as due to the fused planar aromatic hydrocarbon structures, such as high backbone rigidity and backbone planarity of the core structures, strong absorption in the visible range, and high environmental, thermal and chemical stability and the possibility of tuning their optoelectronic properties via functionalization with functional groups such as ketones, halogens and amines.1,2 In addition, some of these materials are very cost-efficient, such as carbazoles, anthanthrones, and quinacridones. Currently, this type of material is employed intensively in organic solar cells (OSCs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), sensors and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).1–5
In particular, the use of inexpensive organic dyes as hole-transporting materials (HTMs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has attracted attention because it opens a new way for the development of cost-effective and printable solar cells. Recently, HTM designs based on anthanthrone (ANT),3,4 carbazole (CAZ),6–8 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),9,10 and isoindigo (IS)11 dyes exhibited promising power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in perovskite devices. Several dye-based HTMs have been reported in the literature, but most of these used a dopant as an additive to increase the power conversion efficiency of the PSC.7,8 Although the PCE was increased, the presence of salt dopants led to a decrease in the stability of the devices and an increase in the cost of production. Therefore, the development of novel dopant-free organic dye-based HTMs is important. To our knowledge, there are few reports about the use of dopant-free dyes as hole-transporting materials for perovskite solar cells in the literature.
Owing to its high chemical and thermal stability, low cost, planar fused molecular structure, intermolecular hydrogen bonds and high charge carrier mobility, in our current study we investigated the use of a quinacridone (QA) dye as the core for the development of a new class of HTMs for PSC technology. QA dyes and their derivatives have been widely employed as active semiconductors in various optoelectronic devices, including organic solar cells, light-emitting diodes, sensors and field-effect transistors.2,12–17 Nevertheless, their use in PSCs has not yet been reported. Interestingly, QA is a well-known acceptor material owing to the presence of two electron-withdrawing ketonic groups in the conjugated backbone. The electron-withdrawing skeleton of QA leads to a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, which minimizes the energy offset between the valence band maximum of perovskite and the HOMO of the hole-transporting layer. This increases the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and ultimately the efficiency of PSCs.3,18–22
Here, we report for the first time three novel quinacridone (QA) dye-based HTMs, in which we used a QA central core as the common acceptor and three different end-capping groups as donors, namely, acenaphthylene (ACE), triphenylamine (TPA) and diphenylamine (DPA). These three materials are named as 2,9-bis(1,2-dihydroacenaphthylen-5-yl)-5,12-dioctyl-5,12-dihydroquinolino[2,3-b]acridine-7,14-dione (ACE-QA-ACE), 2,9-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-5,12-dioctyl-5,12-dihydroquinolino[2,3-b]acridine-7,14-dione (TPA-QA-TPA) and 2,9-bis(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)-5,12-dioctyl-5,12-dihydroquinolino[2,3-b]acridine-7,14-dione (DPA-QA-DPA). These HTMs were fully characterized and used as active hole-transporting layers in mesoscopic TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM solid-state PSCs without using any additives. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different end-capping units in QA-based HTMs on the performance of PSCs. Moreover, a comparison was also made between the efficiency and stability of the new QA-based HTMs and those of standard 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)-based devices.
Results and discussion
Rational design and synthesis
Symmetrical organic semiconductors using planar fused cores have been of great benefit to the performance of devices in optoelectronics applications. In particular, in perovskite solar cells this kind of geometry is usually used to design organic HTMs because it can improve π–π stacking interactions and provide high hole mobility.23–25 In this study, a QA polyaromatic hydrocarbon was selected as the fused central core because of its planar conjugated structure (which has a resemblance to pentacene, with the exception of the nitrogen and ketonic groups present in the backbone). In addition, the strong H-bonding properties provide high charge transport abilities, and the electron-deficient core (acceptor) conjugated backbone plays the role of a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) geometry, which has recently been shown to provide high performance and stability in PSCs.26–28 In our current molecular engineering design, we used a QA acceptor as the core and ACE, TPA and DPA donor groups as end-capping units. TPA and DPA moieties have already been widely used as end-capping groups in the design of organic HTMs for PSCs, and devices using such HTMs displayed not only very high efficiency but also superior stability.3,29–33 In contrast, ACE-substituted conjugated HTMs are very rare, and our group was the first to report an ACE end-capping moiety for PSC devices. In our first report, we reported an ACE end-capped anthanthrone dye, which yielded a PCE of 13.5% without any additives.4 Hence, the fabrication of a series of different end-capping units based on a QA dye that are employed as HTMs in PSCs will provide a comparative view of the effect of these promising small molecules on the performance and stability of PSCs.
The synthesis routes of ACE-QA-ACE, TPA-QA-TPA and DPA-QA-DPA are illustrated in Scheme 1. The preparation of the three precursors, namely, ACE, TPA and DPA, followed earlier procedures.3,4,19,29 The target compounds ACE-QA-ACE and TPA-QA-TPA were synthesized by a Suzuki coupling reaction between an ACE or TPA boronic ester starting material and a common octyl-substituted dibromo-QA core using a palladium catalyst [Pd(PPh3)4] and 2 M K2CO3 base at 120 °C for 48 h in a toluene solvent. The synthesis of the target compound DPA-QA-DPA was carried out via a Buchwald–Hartwig coupling reaction between dibromo-octyl-substituted QA and bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine using a tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium [Pd2(dba)3] catalyst, tri-tert-butylphosphine (tBu3P), and sodium tert-butoxide (NaOtBu) at 110 °C for 48 h in an anhydrous toluene solvent. After purification, the reaction yields of ACE-QA-ACE, TPA-QA-TPA and DPA-QA-DPA were 62%, 54% and 39%, respectively. The purity of these compounds was verified by proton and 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†). Moreover, the molecular weights of these synthesized materials were confirmed by mass spectroscopy. All these substances are highly soluble in most common organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromethane, and chlorobenzene.

Ab initio calculations
In order to gain an insight into the electron density distribution of the key molecular orbitals and the trends in their respective energy levels between the molecules, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP level using the LanL2DZ basis set34–36 and a polarized continuum model of the chloroform solvent37 were performed. The resulting HOMO and LUMO distributions are displayed in Fig. 1. The trends in the HOMO and LUMO energies between the three molecules are similar to those observed experimentally (see below). The computed levels are higher than those measured by PESA, which is likely to be due to limitations of the approximations used. In general, the three new substances exhibit similarities in the electron densities of both the HOMO and the LUMO. The electron distributions of the LUMO are primarily localized on the parent quinacridone skeleton, while those of the HOMO are fully delocalized over the entire molecule. This is in good agreement with previous reports.14,15,38 The calculated HOMO values of ACE-QA-ACE, TPA-QA-TPA, and DPA-QA-DPA are −5.34, −4.93 and −4.85 eV, respectively. The LUMO values are −2.64 eV for ACE-QA-ACE, −2.63 eV for TPA-QA-TPA, and −2.59 eV for DPA-QA-DPA. Accordingly, the band gap is estimated to be 2.70 eV for ACE-QA-ACE, 2.30 eV for TPA-QA-TPA, and 2.26 eV for DPA-QA-DPA. In addition to the above data, the dihedral angle between the end-capping ACE and TPA groups and the QA skeleton is computed to be 47° and 28°, respectively, whereas the dihedral angle between the QA core and the end-capping DPA group was not recorded.

Optical properties
The absorption properties of ACE-QA-ACE, TPA-QA-TPA and DPA-QA-DPA were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy. The normalized UV-vis absorption spectra recorded in chloroform (CF) solutions and solid films are shown in Fig. 2a, and the data are summarized in Table 1. In general, similar spectral patterns were observed for CF solutions and thin films, which suggested that no significant crystallization occurred in the thin films.29,39 In addition, the absorption spectra of samples in CF solutions exhibited a slight blue shift in comparison with those of thin films, which was mainly caused by intermolecular interactions in the solid state and the increased π-electron density (π–π* transitions) of the compound. Obviously, the absorption of TPA-QA-TPA was red-shifted in comparison with those of DPA-QA-DPA and ACE-QA-ACE, which could be ascribed to the higher electron-donating ability of the TPA unit in comparison with those of DPA and ACE.4,29

The spectra of the newly developed materials exhibited three main absorption bands, namely, 300–320 nm, 330–400 nm, and 400–670 nm. This is in good agreement with previous studies related to other derivatives of QA dyes.12,13,15 The absorption peaks in the region of 300–320 nm indicate the absorption of the three different end-capping units.4,29 Moreover, the effect of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the QA skeleton and the end-capping groups resulted in the prominent peaks in the region of 330–400 nm. Furthermore, the weak additional absorption band at 400–670 nm might be caused by ICT between the electron-accepting carbonyl group (CO) of the parent QA molecule and the end-capping groups.15 In CF solutions, the spectrum of ACE-QA-ACE displayed an absorption maximum at 301 nm, whereas those of TPA-QA-TPA and DPA-QA-DPA exhibited maxima at 364 nm and 360 nm, respectively. In solid thin films, the absorption peaks of these materials were found to be at 353 nm for ACE-QA-ACE, 368 nm for TPA-QA-TPA and 364 nm for DPA-QA-DPA. Certainly, the optical band gaps calculated using the absorption onset wavelength (Eoptg = 1240/λonset) of the corresponding absorption spectrum recorded in the solid state were found to be 2.12 eV for ACE-QA-ACE, 1.98 eV for TPA-QA-TPA and 1.87 eV for DPA-QA-DPA.
Furthermore, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the three new materials in CF and toluene solutions were recorded and are illustrated in Fig. S5 (ESI†), and the results are listed in Table 1. Although the spectrum of DPA-QA-DPA did not exhibit an emission in a CF solution, it exhibited an emission in a toluene solution, which is in good agreement with the compound NPh2-QA in a previous report.13 In contrast, the emission maxima of ACE-QA-ACE and TPA-QA-TPA were found to be at 558 nm and 540 nm, respectively. According to the maxima of the absorption and emission peaks, the Stokes shift was estimated to be 257 nm for ACE-QA-ACE, 172 nm for TPA-QA-TPA and 269 nm for DPA-QA-DPA, taking the first strong absorption peak into account.
Thermal properties
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to investigate the 5% weight loss and thermal transitions of the new materials. This information will be helpful for determining the thermal stability, glass transition temperature, melting temperature and other relevant parameters. The corresponding DSC and TGA data are shown in Table 1. According to the TGA curves (Fig. S6, ESI†), the decomposition temperatures (Td) of all these compounds were higher than 410 °C, which indicated their high thermal stability. The Td values were in the following order: DPA-QA-DPA (413 °C) = ACE-QA-ACE (414 °C) < TPA-QA-TPA (424 °C), which are all higher than that of the original QA skeleton (∼370 °C).13,40 The decomposition temperature of the TPA-based HTM was higher than those of the DPA- and ACE-based HTMs, which closely coincides with the results of previous studies.4,41–43 Hence, the substitution of the QA cores with ACE, TPA and DPA moieties resulted in improved thermal stability.
The DSC data (Fig. S7, ESI†) indicate different glass transition temperatures (Tg), melting temperatures (Tm) and crystallization temperatures (Tc) between these compounds. The Tg values of TPA-QA-TPA and DPA-QA-DPA were found to be 105 °C and 74 °C, respectively, whereas the Tg of ACE-QA-ACE was not recorded. In the case of Tm, the values for ACE-QA-ACE and DPA-QA-DPA were estimated to be 265 °C and 215 °C, respectively, which are higher than that of the original QA skeleton (179 °C).13 However, TPA-QA-TPA did not exhibit a Tm, which could be higher than the instrumental measurement range. Moreover, the Tc values of ACE-QA-ACE and DPA-QA-DPA were found to be 212 °C and 141 °C, respectively, whereas the Tc of TPA-QA-TPA was not recorded. Melting and crystallization behaviors of TPA-QA-TPA were not observed, which suggests that TPA-QA-TPA is a typical amorphous glass. Interestingly, the presence of methoxy groups in the DPA units of DPA-QA-DPA led to the observation of a Tc value, a decrease in Td and increases in both Tm and Tg in comparison with the DSC curve of compound NPh2-QA, which does not possess methoxy groups, in a previous report.13
Energy level determination
Determining the energy levels of the hole-transporting materials is crucial for estimating the architecture of a device. In this study, the HOMO values of the three new materials were measured by photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) (Fig. 2b) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S8, ESI†). The LUMO values of ACE-QA-ACE, TPA-QA-TPA and DPA-QA-DPA were calculated using the differences between the HOMO values and the optical band gaps via the equation EPESALUMO = EPESAHOMO + Eoptg. The corresponding data are shown in Table 1. In this report, the energy values based on PESA data were used instead of those based on CV because the PESA measurements were performed on the thin film forms, which are more relevant to the actual devices.3,4 As shown in Fig. 2b, the HOMO values of ACE-QA-ACE, TPA-QA-TPA and DPA-QA-DPA were found to be −5.59 eV, −5.41 eV and −5.28 eV, respectively. These HOMO values are deeper than that of spiro-OMeTAD (−5.22 eV)19,44 which may lead to a more efficient hole-transporting ability than that of conventional spiro-OMeTAD. Substitution with the three different terminating units ACE, TPA and DPA affected the low-lying HOMO energy level and proved that the high electron-donating ability was in the order of ACE > TPA > DPA. The higher electron-donating ability of TPA in comparison with DPA closely coincides with the experimentally observed red shifts in the UV-vis spectra of both compounds and the trends observed in the energy levels of other HTMs based on these end-capping moieties in previous studies.29,42,43,45,46 In contrast, in the case of ACE units, the results were not in good accordance with a previous report.4 This may be attributed to the low electron-donating ability of the QA core in comparison with the high electron-donating ability of an ANT core, which arose from the more extended conjugated nature of the core. According to the HOMO values and the optical band gap, the LUMO value was found to be −3.47 eV for ACE-QA-ACE, −3.43 eV for TPA-QA-TPA and −3.41 eV for DPA-QA-DPA. The LUMO offsets between the active perovskite layer and the hole-transporting material are quite low, and this will block the movement of electrons, which can cause an increase in the efficiency of solar cells.
Perovskite solar cells
The new QA core-based small molecules were employed as hole-transporting materials in typical mesoporous perovskite solar cells with a TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Ag device architecture. This device architecture enabled us to investigate the effects of different end-capping groups on the performance of perovskite solar cells.
The mesoporous devices were prepared using a previously reported procedure,47,48 which is described in the experimental section. A compact TiO2 layer with a thickness of around 30–40 nm was first deposited on a conducting FTO substrate by spray pyrolysis, and then mesoporous TiO2 was deposited using a conventional spin-coating methodology. The CH3NH3PbI3 absorber was then spin-coated using an antisolvent treatment. The perovskite solution was prepared by dissolving 50 wt% of CH3NH3PbI3 in a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL). The sample was annealed for 30 minutes at 100 °C. Once the substrate had cooled, a hole-transporting layer with a thickness of 100–120 nm was applied on top of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. Finally, silver (Ag) as a counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation.
The TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Ag architecture of the PSC devices was kept constant, and only the hole-transporting layer was changed. This enabled us to isolate the effects of the different HTMs that were used. The efficiency of an optimized champion device and the corresponding photovoltaic performance for all three different dopant-free HTMs and conventional doped spiro-OMeTAD are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2. According to Fig. 3a, the PSC device based on an undoped ACE-QA-ACE HTM achieved a record PCE of 18.2% (Jsc = 22.41 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.06 V and FF = 77%), whereas lower PCEs were achieved by the devices that used TPA-QA-TPA and DPA-QA-DPA HTMs under similar conditions. The PSC based on a TPA-QA-TPA HTM achieved a PCE of 16.6% (Jsc = 22.40 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.99 V and FF = 75.1%), whereas that based on a DPA-QA-DPA HTM achieved a PCE of 15.5% (Jsc = 22.38 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.95 V and FF = 73.2%). Moreover, a control device based on doped spiro-OMeTAD achieved an efficiency of 15.2% with a Jsc of 21.44 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.03 V and an FF of 69.3%. In addition, all the devices that were made by employing different HTMs exhibited very little hysteresis (Fig. S9, ESI†). The excessively small band offset between the perovskite and the HTL hampers effective hole transport. Our results show that the higher Voc (1.06 V) achieved by employing an ACE-QA-ACE HTM, in comparison with the lower Voc values of 0.99 V and 0.95 V achieved by using TPA-QA-TPA and DPA-QA-DPA, respectively, was a result of the small band offsets and differences in HOMO values between these HTMs and the perovskite absorber.49–51 Moreover, the PSC based on a dopant free ACE-QA-ACE HTM exhibited a negligible change in short-circuit current density (Jsc = 22.41 mA cm−2) in comparison with those based on TPA-QA-TPA (Jsc = 22.40 mA cm−2) and DPA-QA-DPA (Jsc = 22.38 mA cm−2). This was due to the shallow HOMO of all the QA core-based HTMs, which enables effective hole transport.

The performance of the devices based on the new HTMs was in the following order: DPA-QA-DPA < TPA-QA-TPA < ACE-QA-ACE. The efficiency of devices based on a TPA-QA-TPA HTL was higher than that of devices based on DPA-QA-DPA. This result is in agreement with previous studies that reported that the PCE achieved using HTMs based on TPA terminating groups was higher than that achieved with DPA in mesoporous structures under similar characterization conditions.29,41,42,46,52,53 Furthermore, the PCE of devices based on an ACE-QA-ACE HTM was higher than that of devices based on TPA-QA-TPA, which does not agree well with the results of an earlier study.4 This could be ascribed to the different electron-accepting/donating abilities of quinacridone and anthanthrone cores. Although both quinacridone and anthanthrone contain two ketonic (CO) groups, anthanthrone has a more highly fused aromatic structure with extended conjugation, which possesses a higher electron-donating ability than quinacridone.
The space charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to measure the hole transport properties of different hole-transporting layers. For these measurements, HTMs were spin-coated on top of an ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate, and then gold metal contacts were deposited on top by thermal evaporation. The work functions of ITO and gold are close enough to the HOMO levels of the HTMs, and hence this whole assembly acts as a hole-only device from which the mobility can be determined (Table 1 and Fig. S10, ESI†). The highest hole mobility of 2.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was determined for ACE-QA-ACE and was higher than those of TPA-QA-TPA (1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), DPA-QA-DPA (1.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and doped spiro-OMeTAD (1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). This trend in effective hole transport closely matched that in the efficiency achieved by employing these HTMs.
As shown in Fig. 3b, the devices with an ACE-QA-ACE HTL exhibited an incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of around 80–90% in the range from 360 to 650 nm, which covers the entire UV region, and the highest IPCE of 90% was observed at 540 nm. The integrated current densities calculated from the IPCE spectra presented in Fig. 3b closely match the current density (Jsc) values determined from the I–V curves (Fig. 3a).
The maximum power point tracking for each HTM is displayed in Fig. 3c. In comparison with other organic dyes employed as small-molecule HTMs for perovskite solar cells (Table S2, ESI†), the power conversion efficiency of 18.2% achieved here using a dopant-free ACE-QA-ACE HTM is the highest reported efficiency. The PSCs prepared using ACE-QA-ACE, TPA-QA-TPA, DPA-QA-DPA and spiro-OMeTAD exhibited an average device efficiency of 14.7%, 13.0%, 12.1% and 11.4%, respectively, as shown in Table 2.
Perovskite solar cells suffer from rapid degradation when exposed to conditions of high humidity. Therefore, the measurement of the stability of PSCs at a high humidity is an important aspect for further evaluation. We kept all our champion devices for 720 hours at a relative humidity of 75% and checked their performance at regular intervals. Fig. 3d shows the aging behavior of the perovskite solar cells. The PSCs made with dopant-free HTMs (ACE-QA-ACE, TPA-QA-TPA and DPA-QA-DPA) exhibited improved stability with respect to the devices prepared using doped spiro-OMeTAD. In our previous study, the fast degradation of solar cells that were doped with LiTFSI salt was explained.4
Conclusions
In summary, three novel small-molecule hole-transporting materials based on a quinacridone dye, namely, ACE-QA-ACE, TPA-QA-TPA and DPA-QA-DPA, were designed, synthesized and characterized successfully. For the first time, they were employed as dopant-free HTMs in mesoporous perovskite solar cells. In comparison with cells based on standard doped spiro-OMeTAD (15.2%), perovskite cells prepared using newly developed ACE-QA-ACE, TPA-QA-TPA, and DPA-QA-DPA HTMs achieved efficiencies of 18.2%, 16.6% and 15.5%, respectively, under 1 sun conditions. The resulting devices based on the new HTMs exhibited negligible hysteresis. As a result of avoiding the use of hygroscopic LiTFSI and TBP additives in our novel hole-transporting materials, the stability of unencapsulated devices improved significantly with respect to that of doped spiro-OMeTAD under similar aging conditions. The champion devices that used an ACE-QA-ACE HTL achieved the highest PCE and retained superior stability to that of other HTMs owing to their higher hole mobility and suitable energy levels. This outstanding result proves that the newly developed HTMs based on quinacridone dyes can boost the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cell devices.
