    , Accepted 29th April 2017First published on 1st May 2017AbstractThrough an annealing method, Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C nanoparticles (NPs) of 5–20 nm size were synthesized using a metal–organic framework (MOF) as the precursor. The Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a lower overpotential than RuO2 (0.37 V) and Pt NPs (0.60 V). The better electrocatalytic activity of the hybrid material is associated with its heterojunction structure, in which the strong electron coupling interactions between Co9S8, CoS, CoO and C give rise to a superior synergistic effect. The interconnected amorphous carbon not only anchored the active Co compounds to avoid aggregation, but also afforded conducting channels for electron transfer. Furthermore, the cobalt compounds were the active species in the sample during the OER process; they were converted into CoOOH and Co(OH)2 in the KOH electrolyte, and the S elements in the sample entered the solution. The Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs can exhibit the best OER activity with minimum overpotential (0.028 V) to afford a stable OER current after activation in a KOH aqueous solution. The sample also showed obvious photoresponse to visible light irradiation with enhanced OER current and lowered onset potential, which was probably associated with the semiconducting characteristics of the spin-polarized CoO and the quantum confinement effect of the nanoparticles.
Introduction
With the fossil energy shortage, it is urgent to develop clean and sustainable energy sources. To date, the primary clean and sustainable energy sources are wind, solar power and water, but an efficient method to provide a nearly endless supply of sustainable fuels is to utilize solar energy to split water, producing H2 and O2.1–5 However, the practical application of water splitting is limited because large overpotentials are required to overcome the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode.6,7 At present, the most active catalysts for the OER are precious metal oxides or metal complexes such as ruthenium (Ru), iridium (Ir) and platinum (Pt).8–11 However, their scarcity and high cost hinder their extensive practical use. Therefore, to promote the OER, it is important for us to search and develop new highly catalytic materials that are inexpensive and earth-abundant. Indeed, great progress has been made over the past few years in this field. Particularly, transition metal oxides or sulfides, such as cobalt oxides, cobalt selenide, cobalt sulfide, and cobalt hydroxides/(oxy) hydroxides/hydro- (oxy) oxides for the OER have been widely demonstrated.12–18 However, substantial progress is still needed for reducing the cost and improving the activity and stability of the OER catalysts.19
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a new class of organic–inorganic hybrid materials that have received significant attention in recent years because of their chemical and structure diversity.20 Moreover, they can be used in many fields such as heterogeneous catalysis, ion exchange and energy storage.21 Thus, MOFs are usually considered as novel templates to fabricate porous metal oxides or carbon nanostructures by a simple thermolysis process.22,23 For instance, Zhang et al. reported a porous Co3O4/C nanowire synthesized through thermally annealing a Co-based metal–organic framework (Co-MOF), which can be used as an electrode material for supercapacitors or catalysts for OER.24 Xu et al. prepared a porous CoP concave polyhedron by a topological conversion strategy using Co-MOF (ZIF-67) as the precursor, which exhibited good electrocatalytic properties for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).25
Herein, we utilize a facile method to synthesize Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C nanoparticles (NPs) via one-step low temperature calcination using a Co-MOF, which we reported previously,25 as the precursor. The Co-MOF, Co(H2L)2(H2O)2·2DMF (H3L = 2-thiobarbituric acid, DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide) was chosen based on the following considerations:26 (1) the three dimensional (3D) diamondoid framework (Fig. S1†) makes it possible to obtain a uniformly dispersed and interconnected multi-component catalyst by annealing the Co-MOF;26 (2) the organic ligand in the Co-MOF is 2-thiobarbituric acid (H3L), in which C, S, O and N atoms coexist. It is expected that the organic ligand can act as C and S sources during the calcination to obtain a hybrid material containing metal oxides, metal sulfides and carbon; (3) if the conducting carbon is incorporated with metal oxides or sulfides, the poor intrinsic electrical conductivity of individual components can be solved. The interactions between carbon and metal oxides or sulfides can modify the overall physicochemical and electronic structures to favor the electron transfer at the interface; (4) recent studies have shown that metal atoms whose d-electron numbers are near 4 and 7, such as Co(II), have superior OER activity;27–29 thus, the MOF based on Co(II) was chosen as the precursor.
The obtained Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C sample was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurement as well as UV-vis absorption and diffuse reflectance spectra. The obtained sample exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution with a lower overpotential than the state-of-the art RuO2 catalyst (0.37 V). After activation in KOH aqueous solution, the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C sample exhibited the best OER activity with minimum overpotential (η = 0.028 V) to afford a stable OER current density. After electrochemical measurement, the sample was further characterized by PXRD, TEM, HRTEM, SAED, XPS and EDS to investigate the possible transformation of the sample during the OER. The bond structures and the orbital populations of the individual components in the sample were calculated, and the sample also showed obvious photoresponse to visible light irradiation (350 nm < λ < 650 nm, 100 mW cm−2) with enhanced OER current density and lowered onset potential. Overall, the strategy developed herein offers an approach to the design and synthesis of an effective quaternary electro- and photocatalyst for the OER.
Experimental
Materials
Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Ba(NO3)2 were obtained from Chengdu Reagent Corporation. 2-Thiobarbituric acid (C4H4N2O2S) was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Potassium deuteroxide (KOH, 99.99% metal purity), Nafion perfluorinated resin solution (5 wt%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), RuO2 and Pt nanoparticles were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of Co(H2L)2(H2O)2·2DMF
The synthesis of the Co-MOF precursor is according to our previous work.26 In a typical procedure, 1 mmol of 2-thiobarbituric acid (0.14 g) (H3L) and NaOH (0.03 g, 1 mmol) were added to 30 mL of water/ethanol/DMF solution (v/v/v = 1:1:1). After the mixture was ultrasonicated for 5 min, a transparent solution was obtained, then Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.14 g, 0.5 mmol) was added and the mixture was ultrasonicated at room temperature (25 °C) for another 20 min. Finally, the obtained pink precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol three times, then dried at 80 °C overnight and characterized by PXRD and SEM.
Synthesis of Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C nanoparticles (NPs)
The Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs were prepared by calcining the above Co-MOF in a tubular furnace under continuous Ar gas flow. The system was heated to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1, then held at 300 °C for 1 h, and cooled to room temperature at 5 °C min−1.
Characterization
The PXRD data were collected at room temperature using a Tongda TD-3500 diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (1.54056 Å). The morphologies, energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) and elemental mappings of the samples were observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-7600F, JEOL). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns, as well as EDS analyses were made on a FEI Tecnai G20 high-resolution transmission electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using Al Kα as the X-ray source. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and porous structure of the sample were measured by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The pH value of the electrolyte solution was determined by a PHS-25 precision pH/mV meter (Shanghai Lida Instrument Company). A UV-vis spectrophotometer (TU-1901, Beijing Puxi) was used to measure the UV-vis absorption or diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples. The band gap of the sample was determined from the absorption edge, converted from the reflectance spectrum via the transformed Kubelka–Munk equation.
Computational methods
The first-principle calculations were carried out by using spin density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof parametrization (PBE) for the exchange–correlation functional via the Cambridge Series Total Energy Package (CASTEP) program in Materials Studio 7.0. The calculation was divided into two parts. The first part was to optimize the crystal structures based on their crystallographic data (ICSD reference numbers: 23929 for Co9S8, 53066 for CoS, 17013 for CoO, 53994 for Co(OH)2 and 20566 for CoOOH). The second step was to calculate the band structure and density of states for the optimized structure. All calculations were under the kinetic energy cut-off of 500 eV. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials were applied to represent the interaction between valence electrons and ion cores with a 1.0 × 10−5 eV per atom SCF tolerance threshold. The Brillouin zones were sampled in reciprocal space by the Monkhorst–Pack scheme with a 4 × 4 × 3 k-point mesh for Co9S8, and 5 × 7 × 8 k-point meshes for CoS, CoO, Co(OH)2 and CoOOH.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature using a rotating disk working electrode (RDE) (ATA-1B, Jiangshu Jinfen Instrument Co.) made of glassy carbon (5 mm diameter, 0.196 cm2) connected to an electrochemical workstation (RST5200, Zhengzhou Shiruisi Technology Co. Ltd). A Hg/HgO and a platinum wire were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Current was normalized by dividing by the geometrical surface area of the electrode. All potential values were converted in terms of the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) using E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Hg/HgO) + 0.098 + 0.059 V × pH. For preparing the working electrode, the glassy carbon (GC) electrode was polished to a mirror finish and thoroughly cleaned before use. First, 0.2 mg of sample was dispersed in 0.2 mL ethanol with 10 μL of Nafion solution (5 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich). Then, the mixture was ultrasonicated for about 0.5 h to generate a homogeneous ink. Next, the dispersion was drop-coated on the GC electrode surface, which was subsequently dried by an IR lamp. An aqueous solution of 1 M KOH was used as the electrolyte for all the measurements. The OER activities of all samples were investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The LSV curves were obtained at a rotating rate of 1600 rpm with the sweep rate of 10 mV s−1. The CV curves were obtained at a rotating rate of 1600 rpm with sweep rates of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 150 mV s−1, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instrumental Co. Ltd) in the same configuration at 1.38 V vs. RHE (overpotential η = 0.15 V) over a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz at the amplitude of the sinusoidal voltage of 5 mV at room temperature. For the stability evaluations, the potential of the electrode was cycled between a potential range of 0.25–1.40 V vs. RHE at a sweep rate of 150 mV s−1. Chronoamperometry data were collected for the sample-modified RDE or sample-modified nickel foam at a η of 0.15 V. The sample-modified nickel foam was prepared as follows: 5 mg of sample was dispersed in 2 mL ethanol under ultrasonication to form a homogeneous ink, which was then drop-coated and pasted on a Ni foam current collector (1 × 1 cm2) with a pressure of 10 MPa, and dried at 120 °C for 2 h. The faradaic efficiency was determined as follows: the sample-modified nickel foam was used as the working electrode (sample loading: 3.6 mg cm−2) and controlled potential electrolysis was conducted at applied potential of 1.72 V vs. RHE (overpotential η = 0.49 V) for 2 hours in an H-tube, in which one compartment was gas-tight and housed the above working electrode and the Hg/HgO reference electrode, and another compartment housed the Pt foil counter electrode. The two compartments were separated by filter papers. Both compartments were filled with the 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. The generated O2 volume during electrolysis was quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed by using a drainage gas collector30 and GC-MS instrument (GC6890/5973N), respectively. The atmospheric pressure and the temperature were measured by a barometer (JX-01, Shanghai Jinxiao Electronic Instrument Co., Ltd). The theoretical (assuming 100% faradaic efficiency) O2 volume was based on the amount of consumed charges during the course of electrolysis, which was recorded on the electrochemical workstation (CHI660E).31
Photoelectrochemical measurements
The photoelectrochemical performance of the photoelectrode was evaluated with a standard electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) in the three-electrode configuration. The three-electrode configuration was put in a two-necked reactor made of quartz, with cooling water. Here, a Pt plate was used as the counter electrode, a Ag/AgCl electrode in saturated KCl served as the reference electrode, and 1 M KOH aqueous solution was employed as the electrolyte. The photoelectrode was prepared as follows: 0.2 mg of sample was ultrasonicated in a mixture of ethanol (0.2 mL) and Nafion (10 uL) solution, then the slurry was deposited on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (12–14 μS m−1) with 1 × 1 cm2 of the effective area, which was subsequently dried by an IR lamp and used as the working electrode for the photoelectrochemical measurements. Light irradiation was performed using a 300 W xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300, Beijing Aulight Co., 650 nm > λ > 350 nm) with an incident light intensity of about 100 mA cm−2 from the front side of the photoelectrode, and the potential values were referenced to RHE through E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.96. The CV curves were scanned at a rate of 10 mV s−1 and the photocurrent–time test under chopped light (light on/off cycles: 100 s) was carried out at a fixed potential of 1.07 V vs. RHE. The impedance measurements were performed in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz with a sinusoidal perturbation of 5 mV under a bias of 1.07 V vs. RHE.

Results and discussion
Structure and morphology of the Co-MOF precursor
As shown in Fig. S2,† the PXRD pattern of the Co-MOF confirms that all the diffraction peaks of the Co-MOF can be perfectly indexed to the simulated ones generated based on the single crystal structure analysis of the M-MOF (M = Mg or Ni) in our previous work,26 indicating that the Co-MOF possesses a 3D acentric diamondoid framework (Fig. S1†). The morphology of the Co-MOF precursor was characterized by SEM (Fig. S3†). Fig. S3† shows that the typical SEM images of the Co-MOF are nanorods or nanosheets with smooth surfaces. It appears that the diameters of the nanorods or the thickness of the nanosheets are no more than 100 nm.
Structure and morphology of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs
After calcination of the Co-MOF at 300 °C for 1 h under the argon atmosphere, we obtained the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C hybrid powder. The crystallographic structure of the calcined sample was first investigated by PXRD. As shown in Fig. 1, the PXRD pattern of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C hybrid powder shows diffraction peaks that are indexed to Co9S8 (JCPDS #65-6801), CoS (JCPDS #65-8977) and CoO (JCPDS #43-1003) and a certain amount of amorphous substance.
 Fig. 1  The PXRD patterns of the pure Co9S8, CoS, CoO and Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C hybrid powder. 
As shown in Fig. 1, the peaks at 2θ values of 29.8°, 47.7° and 52.3° correspond to the (311), (333) and (440) phase planes of typical crystalline Co9S8 (JCPDS #65-6801), respectively. The peaks located at 30.5, 35.1, 46.7 and 54.2° correspond to the (100), (101), (102) and (110) planes of the CoS phase (JCPDS #65-8977), respectively, and the peaks at 36.6°, 42.5° and 62.0° correspond to the (10), (11) and (111) planes of CoO (JCPDS #43-1003), respectively.
The PXRD pattern of the calcined sample also shows a relatively broad peak from 15 to 30°, and it may correspond to the amorphous carbon (Fig. 1). The presence of the carbon material in the sample is also evidenced by the Raman spectrum. As shown in Fig. 2, the Raman spectrum presents the typical features of the carbon material at 1327 and 1571 cm−1, which could be assigned to the defective and graphitic nature of the carbon.33–35 Generally, the G-band at 1571 cm−1 corresponds to the “in-plane” displacement of carbon atoms in the hexagonal sheets, which represents the highly ordered graphite carbon materials, and the D-band (or “defect” band) at 1327 cm−1 is characteristic of the disordered graphite.33–35

As shown in Fig. 3, the morphology of the annealed sample is uniform, and is composed of regular nanoparticles (NPs). The typical transmission electron microscope (TEM) images (Fig. 3a and b) and the SEM images (Fig. 3c and d) of the sample show that the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs are well dispersed, with the size in the range of 5–20 nm. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the calcined sample indicate the coexistence of the crystalline and amorphous phases in the hybrid material (Fig. 4).

 Fig. 4  HRTEM (a–d) of the as-synthesized Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs. 
As shown in Fig. 4a and S4a,† the HRTEM image of the selected area within the red dotted lines and the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) reveal that the highly crystalline nanoparticles have a hexagonal symmetry with a d spacing of 2.55 Å, corresponding to the (101) planes of the hexagonal CoS phase. The HRTEM image of the selected area embraced by the dotted lines of another particle in Fig. 4b shows the lattice fringe of the CoO (10) plane with a d spacing of 2.45 Å, and the corresponding FFT image (Fig. S4b†) further proves the monoclinic symmetry of CoO. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the HRTEM images of the labeled areas with the red dotted lines reveal that the crystalline nanoparticles have distinct lattice fringes with interplanar spacing of 2.99 and 1.76 Å, corresponding to the (311) (Fig. 4c) and (440) planes of Co9S8 (Fig. 4d), respectively. The FFT analyses (Fig. S4c†) of the HRTEM images (Fig. 4c and d) further confirm the cubic symmetry of Co9S8. The hybrid material is a heterojunction based on three crystalline phases: Co9S8, CoS, CoO, and one amorphous phase (Fig. 4a–d) in which the four components are interconnected to each other.
The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern taken from one particle of the calcined sample displays the polycrystalline nature due to several crystalline phases assembled in the microstructure (Fig. S5a†). The SAED pattern displays diffraction spots with d spacings of 5.73, 2.87 and 2.99 Å (marked in yellow), respectively, which can be indexed as the (111), (222), and (311) planes in the cubic Co9S8 structure, respectively (Fig. S5a†). The diffraction spots with d spacings of 2.93 and 2.55 Å (marked in sapphire) correspond to the (100) and (101) planes of the hexagonal CoS phase, respectively (Fig. S5a†), which is consistent with the lattice fringes in the HRTEM images (Fig. 4). The diffraction peaks with d spacing of 2.45 and 2.13 Å, as indexed to the (10) and (11) planes of the monoclinic CoO matrix, can also be clearly detected (marked in green), which is in good agreement with the diffraction peaks in the PXRD pattern of the calcined sample (Fig. 1).
Elemental analyses from energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S6a and c†) and elemental mappings (Fig. S6b†) verify that only Co, S, O and C elements coexist in the calcined sample. Two regions of the sample were selected for EDS, and it was revealed that the atomic percentages of the Co, S, O and C in the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C hybrid material are 5.3/16.9, 3.8/13.2, 11.9/18.3 and 79.0/51.6%, respectively (Fig. S6a and c†). The large amount of C atoms in the hybrid material indicates that the amorphous phase in the PXRD pattern and HRTEM images of the sample is the amorphous carbon. As the HRTEM images show in Fig. 4, the three crystalline phases, Co9S8, CoS and CoO are embedded into the amorphous carbon material. The elemental mappings reveal that Co, O, S and C elements are uniformly distributed within the selected region of the sample (Fig. S6b†).
It was expected that the C skeleton of the organic ligand in the Co-MOF would be transformed into the carbon material during the calcination at 300 °C in Ar atmosphere. In the structure of the Co-MOF, the Co(II) ions are coordinated with the O atoms of the organic ligands,26 which were transformed into CoO nanoparticles during the calcination. Though the S atoms from the organic ligands were not coordinated with the Co(II) centers in the Co-MOF, they were converted into Co9S8 and CoS during the annealing, which is due to the strong affinity between Co2+ and S2− based on their mutual polarization. Thus, calcination of the 3D diamondoid framework of the Co-MOF leads to the formation of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C heterojunction, in which the amorphous carbon and the three crystalline materials are assembled together into a continuous phase.
In order to investigate the electronic states of the Co, O, S and C elements in the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C heterojunction, XPS measurements were performed, which showed the presence of Co 2p, O 1s, C 1s, N 1s and S 2p without interference from any impurities (Fig. 5a),36–39 which is consistent with the EDS analyses.
 Fig. 5  XPS spectra of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C sample before (upper) and after the electrolysis experiment (a). The fine XPS spectra of Co 2p (b), O 1s (c), C 1s (d) and S 2p (e) in the sample before (upper) and after (below) the 6 h-electrolysis experiment. 
As shown in Fig. 5b, in the Co 2p region, the main peaks at 781.5 and 797.5 eV can each be assigned to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 binding energies, while 785.6 and 803.1 eV correspond to their respective satellite lines.40–44 When the 2p3/2 peak was deconvoluted, the peaks at 781.5 and 781.2 eV were assigned to the Co2+ state,40,41 and the binding energies of the peaks matched sufficiently well with the reported Co2+ cations in Co9S8 and CoO.42,43
In Fig. 5c, the peaks at 531.2 and 532.9 eV indicate the presence of oxygen-containing groups in the calcined sample. The two O 1s peaks can be attributed to the CO (531.2 eV) and absorbed water (532.9 eV), respectively.24,45
XPS spectra of C 1s of the calcined sample can be seen in Fig. 5d. The peak at 284.2 eV corresponds to CC, which suggests that a large amount of CC bonds exist in the present sample. Another peak appeared at approximately 285.6 eV, which can be attributed to the carbons that bond with oxygen or nitrogen, suggesting the presence of C–O and C–N bonds in the sample. The third peak at 288.4 eV corresponds to the CO bond.46 The small amounts of N atoms and C–N bonds are from the organic ligand in the Co-MOF.26
The S element in the sample also comes from the organic ligand in the Co-MOF, since there is no other sulfur source in the calcination process. The S 2p spectrum is shown Fig. 5e. The first two peaks (161.3 and 162.2 eV) are doublet structures due to spin–orbit coupling (S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2) in the metal sulfide.47–51 The peaks at 163.5 and 165.1 eV correspond to the C–S and CS bonds, respectively.43 The existence of the C–S and CS bonds indicates the covalent interactions between the carbon and the metal sulfide, such as Co9S8, CoS, in the calcined sample. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5e, the peaks at 168.1 and 169 eV can be distinguished, which correspond to the OSO and SO4 bonds, respectively, suggesting that there are chemical couplings between the CoO and the metal sulfide in the sample. The XPS analyses are in agreement with the HRTEM images of the sample, further indicating that the calcined sample is a heterojunction, based on C, Co9S8, CoS and CoO, in which there are strong electron coupling interactions.
Fig. S7† shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution curve of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the sample are of type IV (Fig. S7a†), indicating the presence of mesopores (2–50 nm). The pore size distribution plot of the sample presents a small peak at ca. 2 nm, and an intense peak at ca. 12 nm is observed in the range of 3–70 nm (Fig. S7b†), which indicates a wide pore-size distribution from 2 to 70 nm, further confirming the existence of mesopores and macropores (Fig. S7b†). The specific surface area of the sample was calculated to be 33.7 m2 g−1.
OER activity of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs
The OER activity of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs was evaluated in O2-saturated 1 M KOH solution in a standard three electrode system, with Pt wire and Hg/HgO as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C catalyst ink was cast on a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE) to be used as the working electrode. All the electrochemical data of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C sample were recorded after 100 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles in the potential range from 0.25 to 1.40 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 150 mV s−1. The OER polarization curves were measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSVs) with a continuous rotating speed of 1600 rpm at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1. For comparison, similar measurements for both commercial RuO2 and Pt catalysts (Aladdin Co.) were also performed.

Fig. 6 shows the iR-uncorrected polarization curves of the catalysts. The onset catalytic potentials for the OER at Pt, RuO2 and the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C sample are 1.60, 1.52 and 1.12 V vs. RHE, respectively, indicating that the OER activity of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs is better, compared to the commercial Pt and RuO2 catalysts. Generally, the potential required for the current density of 10 mA cm−2 is used for evaluating the electrochemical activity of an OER catalyst. It is also found that the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C catalyst, after 100 CV cycles, displays the best OER performance among the three catalysts, with the potential of 1.38 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2, which is smaller than those of Pt (1.83 V vs. RHE) and RuO2 (1.60 V vs. RHE) (Fig. 6).

The overpotentials of the catalysts at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 are summarized in Table 1. After 100 CV cycles, the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C catalyst affords a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a small overpotential of 0.15 V, which is smaller than those of Pt (0.60 V) and RuO2 (0.37 V) under the same experimental conditions. It is worth mentioning that all the polarization curves shown here are without any iR-correction.

CVs of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs, RuO2 and Pt at different scan rates in the three-electrode cell with a rotating speed of 1600 rpm are shown in Fig. S8–S10,† respectively. Fig. 7 shows the comparison of the CVs for the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C, RuO2 and Pt at a sweep rate of 10 mV s−1. After 100 CV cycles, the onset OER potentials at the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C catalyst for both positive and negative scans are lower than those observed at the RuO2 and Pt, further indicating that the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C catalyst possesses better OER activity than the state-of-the art highly active precious catalysts such as RuO2 and Pt. All the CV curves shown here are also without any iR-correction.

It is thought that the excellent OER activity of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C catalyst originated from its heterojunction structure based on Co9S8, CoS, CoO and carbon. The covalent interactions among the three crystalline phases and one amorphous phase give rise to the much improved OER activity, compared to their individual entities.52–55 The four moieties are supported together as a heterojunction, in which the interconnected amorphous carbon, except for anchoring and dispersing the active sites of the Co compounds, also serves as highly conducting channels to improve the electron transfer on the electrode surface. The strong electron coupling interactions among the three crystalline Co compounds, are helpful for the electron transfer between the electrolyte of OH− and the active sites, leading to a superior synergistic effect. Another factor to be taken into account is the nanostructured nature of Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C particles. The nanosize and good dispersion of the catalyst result in more active sites exposure to the alkaline electrolyte.
To further prove the best OER electrocatalytic efficiency for the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to study the electrode kinetics under OER conditions. The Nyquist plots at 1.38 V vs. RHE (overpotential η = 0.15 V) (Fig. S11†) reveal that the charge-transfer resistance for the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs is much lower than that for RuO2, suggesting that the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs have faster charge transfer during the OER process than RuO2, which could be associated with the unique electronic structure of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C heterojunction.
The OER kinetics of the above catalysts were also estimated based on corresponding Tafel plots. The Tafel slope of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs after 100 CV cycles was 96 mV dec−1, which is smaller than that of Pt (110 mV dec−1), and comparable to that of RuO2 (87 mV dec−1) (Fig. 8 and Table 1), further demonstrating that it is an effective catalyst for the OER, in comparison to Pt and RuO2.56–58

At η = 0.15 V, the mass activity for the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C catalyst was found to be 50 A g−1, outperforming RuO2 (10 A g−1) and Pt (4.5 A g−1) (Table 1), which is associated with the low molecular weight of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C catalyst due to the coexistence of the light atoms Co, S, O and C in the sample.
OER activity of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs before and after activation
In order to test the electrochemical stability of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C sample, the CV cycling experiment was performed in the potential range of 0.25–1.40 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 150 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 9, the OER onset potentials at the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs for the 1st, 100th and 700th cycles were 1.16, 1.12 and 1.07 V vs. RHE, respectively, which became smaller and smaller with the continuous CV cycles, suggesting the activation of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C catalyst and the increase in the electroactive species (i.e. CoOOH) on the electrode surface during the CV cycles in the KOH electrolyte.19
 Fig. 9  CVs of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C in 1 M KOH aqueous solution at a sweep rate of 150 mV s−1 obtained at the 1st cycle, 100th cycle and 700th cycle, and after the 6 h-electrolysis experiment. CV curves were not iR-compensated (rotating speed: 1600 rpm, catalyst loading: 0.2 mg cm−2). 
After 700 CV cycles, the polarization curve of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs was recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 6, the OER potentials at the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C sample giving an OER current density of 10 mA cm−2 after the 100th and 700th cycles were 1.38 and 1.258 V vs. RHE, respectively (overpotential η = 0.15 and 0.028 V, respectively) (Fig. 6), indicating that the electrocatalytic activity of the sample for the OER was improved with further cycling. It is worth noting that the OER overpotential at the sample for the 700th cycle was 0.028 V, outperforming RuO2 (0.37 V). After 700 CV cycles, the Tafel slope of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs was 81 mV dec−1, which is also better than that of RuO2 (87 mV dec−1) (Fig. 8 and Table 1).56–58
In an attempt to investigate the reason for the improved electrocatalytic OER activity of the sample with CV cycling, the sample after 700 CV cycles was characterized by PXRD and EDS. As shown in Fig. S12,† the PXRD pattern indicated that the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C sample greatly lost its crystallinity after 700 CV cycles. The EDS data revealed that there were Co, C, N, S, O and K elements in the sample after 700 CV cycles, where the K came from the KOH electrolyte (Fig. S13†). The molar percentages of the atoms in the sample before and after the 700 CV cycles are shown in Table S1.† After the 700 CV cycles, the amount of O was increased, accompanied by the decrease in the amount of S, indicating the partial transformation of the cobalt sulfide into cobalt oxide or cobalt hydroxide during the CV cycles in KOH aqueous solution. The superior OER activity of the sample after 700 CV cycles (overpotential η = 0.028 V at 10 mA cm−2) could probably be attributed to the in situ formation of the CoOOH phase, in that the highly oxidized Co can facilitate the formation of hydroperoxy (OOH) species (key intermediates in the OER) and subsequent conversion to O2.
The stability of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs was further evaluated by using a chronoamperometric method. The electrolysis experiment was performed at a potential of 1.38 V vs. RHE (overpotential η = 0.15 V) in the three-electrode system with the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C-modified RDE (catalyst loading: 0.2 mg cm−2), Hg/HgO and platinum wire as working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The rotating speed was set at 1600 rpm. After 6 h-electrolysis at 1.38 V vs. RHE, the CV of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C modified RDE was further measured in the potential range of 0.25–1.55 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 0.15 V s−1. As shown in Fig. 9, it was found that the OER onset potential (1.19 V vs. RHE) was slightly shifted positively, in comparison to the value recorded on the 100th cycle (1.12 V vs. RHE), indicating that the OER activity of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs was slightly decreased after the 6 h-electrolysis.
The bulk electrolysis experiments were also performed for the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs, commercial RuO2 and Pt at 1.38 V vs. RHE in a similar three-electrode system, but using sample-modified Ni foam (catalyst loading: 5 mg cm−2) as the working electrode instead (Fig. 10). The video for the electrolysis experiment at the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C-modified Ni foam can be seen in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 10a and Table S2,† the start-up current density (t = 0) at the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs is relatively high (271.7 mA cm−2), which is larger than the start-up current densities observed at RuO2 (183.1 mA cm−2) and Pt (65.8 mA cm−2) under the same experimental conditions, indicating the largest OER current at the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs.
 Fig. 10  Chronoamperometry data (j–t) obtained for Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NP-, commercial RuO2- and Pt-modified Ni foam at a constant potential of 1.38 V vs. RHE (overpotential η = 0.15 V) measured in 1 M KOH with different scales (catalyst loading: 5 mg cm−2) (a) and (b). 
As shown in Fig. 10b and Table S2,† the current density at the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs decreased from the start-up current density to the lowest value of 4.129 mA cm−2 at ca. 0.41 h. The OER catalytic current density at the sample increased until it reached a maximum of 5.460 mA cm−2 at ca. 3.41 h and fluctuated at 5.4–5.3 mA cm−2 during the following 1–2 h. The phenomenon was in line with the CV cycling experiment, in which the OER wave was negatively shifted with smaller onset potential during the continuous 700 CV cycling (Fig. 9), further suggesting the activation of the catalyst and the increase in the electroactive species during the electrochemical experiment. However, about 5 h later, the OER current density at the sample decreased slightly and it approached 4.837 mA cm−2 at the end of the 6 h-electrolysis experiment (t = 6 h) (Fig. 10b and Table S2†), indicating the partial deactivation of the catalyst after the 6 h-electrolysis. The decrease was ca. 11% with respect to the largest stable current density at 3.41 h (5.460 mA cm−2).
However, as far as the two commercial noble metal catalysts are concerned, the OER catalytic current densities at the RuO2 and Pt dropped quickly to a stable value of 1.351 and 0.317 mA cm−2 in a short time of ca. 0.06 h (Fig. 10 and Table S2†). At 0.41 h, the OER current densities at the RuO2 and Pt reached 1.084 and 0.079 mA cm−2, respectively, far lower than the value observed at the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C catalyst (4.129 mA cm−2) (Fig. 10 and Table S2†); at the end of the electrolysis experiment (t = 6 h), the OER current densities at the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs (4.837 mA cm−2) were much higher than those at the RuO2 (0.756 mA cm−2) and Pt (0.033 mA cm−2), further indicating that the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs show better OER activity than the RuO2 and Pt (Fig. 10 and Table S2†). With respect to the OER current density at 3.41 h, the decreases at RuO2 and Pt were 13 and 18%, respectively, which are higher than that at the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs (11%), indicating that the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs possess stable and durable OER activity.
Structural and morphological characterization of the sample after electrolysis
After the 6 h-electrolysis experiment, the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs were further characterized by PXRD (Fig. S12†), TEM (Fig. 11), HRTEM (Fig. 12), SAED (Fig. S5b†) and EDS (Fig. S14†). A large amorphous hump was observed in the PXRD pattern of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C after the 6 h-electrolysis experiment, indicating that the sample lost its crystallinity remarkably (Fig. S12†). The morphology of the sample after the electrolysis experiment was characterized by TEM. As shown in Fig. 11, no aggregation was observed after the stability test; on the contrary, the TEM images showed that the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs became smaller and the size was around 5 nm. This is probably associated with the amorphous carbon support in the sample, which anchored and dispersed the active sites of the Co compounds uniformly to avoid aggregation.

 Fig. 12  HRTEM (a–e) of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs after the 6 h-electrolysis experiment. 
After the 6 h-electrolysis experiment, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) (Fig. S15a and b†) of the HRTEM images (Fig. 12a and b) revealed that crystalline nanoparticles embraced by the red dotted lines possess hexagonal space groups, probably corresponding to the hexagonal Co(OH)2 and CoOOH. The HRTEM images show d spacings of 2.38 and 2.43 Å, probably corresponding to the (101) planes of the hexagonal Co(OH)2 and CoOOH phases, respectively.
However, the FFT image analyses (Fig. S15c–e†) of the areas outlined by the red dotted lines in the HRTEM images (Fig. 12c–e) indicate the monoclinic structure of the nanoparticles after electrolysis, and their HRTEM images (Fig. 12c–e) reveal that the nanoparticles have lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 2.13 and 2.45 Å, probably corresponding to the (11) and (10) planes of the monoclinic CoO.
In conclusion, it was found that the sample after the 6 h-electrolysis experiment still retained the heterojunction structure, in which different crystalline phases and the amorphous phase were interconnected (Fig. 12a–e).
EDS elemental analyses (Fig. S14a and c†) and elemental mappings (Fig. S14b and d†) of the catalyst after the 6 h-electrolysis experiment indicate that there are Co, O, C, S and K elements in the catalyst. The atom percentages for two selected regions of the catalyst are 13.7/11.5% for Co, 44.8/37.8% for O, 36.8/46.0% for C, 4.6/4.5% for K and 0.1/0.2% for S, respectively, taking no account of the amount of Si from the Si substrate (Fig. S14a, c and Table S1†), in which the amount of K is from the KOH electrolyte. The data reveal that the amount of S in the catalyst is greatly decreased after electrolysis (0.1/0.2 at%) with respect to the original sample (3.8/13.2 at%) and the residual amount can almost be neglected. In contrast, the amount of O was greatly increased (44.8/37.8 at%) in comparison to that before electrochemical measurement (11.9/18.3 at%) (Fig. S14a, c and Table S1†), indicating that the CoS and Co9S8 in the catalyst were transformed into CoOOH during the electrocatalysis for the OER in the presence of KOH electrolyte. The result is in agreement with the HRTEM and the corresponding FFT analyses, which suggest that after electrolysis the sample consists of Co(OH)2, CoOOH, CoO and C.
As shown in Fig. S5b,† the SAED pattern of the sample after the 6 h-electrolysis experiment displays a polycrystalline nature. On comparing the SAED pattern of the sample before and after electrolysis, it was found that the obvious diffraction spot with d spacing of 5.73 Å (Fig. S5a†), which was indexed as the (111) plane of Co9S8 in the catalyst, disappeared after the 6 h-electrolysis (Fig. S5b†), which is consistent with the EDS data, suggesting the transformation of Co9S8 into Co(OH)2 or CoOOH during the 6 h-electrolysis process for the OER. The results prove that the good electrocatalytic activity of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs is associated with the Co9S8 and CoS, which are the active species in the catalyst during the OER process.
XPS was further employed to characterize the catalyst after the stability test. Fig. 5a shows that there was only Co, O and C in the sample after the 6 h-electrolysis, and the S element was almost not detected, which is in agreement with the EDS results, indicating that the S element probably entered into the solution during the OER. As shown in Fig. 5b, the main peaks at 780.8 and 795.9 eV can be assigned to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 binding energies. The Co 2p3/2 peaks can be deconvoluted into three components: the peaks at 780.3, 781.5 eV and 782.5 eV corresponding to the Co2+, Co3+ and the shake-up, respectively, which is similar to the binding energies of the Co3+ and Co2+ cations in CoOOH, Co(OH)2 and CoO.55,59–61 The results indicate that the Co(II) ions can react with the KOH electrolyte and be converted to Co(III) ions during OER. As shown in Fig. 5c, the O 1s peak of 529.5 eV, which appears after the 6 h-electrolysis, proves the existence of CoOOH.62 The C 1s peaks can be seen in Fig. 5d; the peaks at 284.5 and 288.4 eV correspond to the CC and CO bonds, respectively, which are similar to those of the sample before the 6 h-electrolysis. However, the peak at 285.4 eV only agrees with the C–O bond, and the C–N bond cannot be detected in the sample after the 6 h-electrolysis (Fig. 5d).
As described above, the amount of S is largely decreased after 700 CV cycles (2.7 at%) and after the 6 h-electrolysis experiment (0.1/0.2 at%), in comparison to the original S content in the sample (3.8/13.2 at%) (Fig. S6a–c, S13a–c, S14a–c and Table S1†). In order to investigate whether the S content in the catalyst continues to decline during prolonged OER testing, a 12 h-electrolysis experiment was performed using the sample-modified Ni foam as the working electrode. EDS elemental analyses and the elemental mappings of two selected regions of the sample after the 12 h-electrolysis experiment are shown in Fig. S16,† in which the amount of Ni came from the Ni foam, and the Ni amount was not taken into account. It was found that the S element completely disappeared after the prolonged electrolysis experiment (Fig. S16a, c and Table S1†). The losses of S elements in the solid sample suggest that the S element probably entered into the solution or gas phase during the OER.
In order to prove the above statement, the faradaic efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction was measured, in which the sample-modified nickel foam was used as the working electrode (sample loading: 3.6 mg cm−2) and controlled potential electrolysis was conducted at the applied potential of 1.72 V vs. RHE (overpotential η = 0.49 V) in the three-electrode system for 2 hours. The consumed charge recorded on the electrochemical workstation was 180 C (Fig. S17†), and the generated O2 volume was ca. 12.0 mL (4.68 × 10−4 mol) under the atmospheric pressure of 96.56 kPa and the temperature of 24 °C. The faradaic efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction was then calculated as ca. 100%.
During the determination of the faradaic efficiency, no CO2, CO, CS2, CH4 or SO2 were detected by GC-MS in the gaseous phase; it was estimated that the S element entered into the solution during the electrolysis process. As shown in Fig. S18,† it was found that the electrolyte solution turned yellow after the electrolysis; the UV-visible absorption spectra of the solution were investigated before and after the electrolysis experiment. As shown in Fig. S19,† an additional absorption band in the range of 230–350 nm was observed after the experiment, which was probably due to the π–π* transition, indicating that a new species with double bond, such as SO42−, was generated in the solution. With the increase in the electrolysis time, the absorption intensity of the band increased (Fig. S19†), suggestive of an increase in the concentration of the newly generated species. The pH values of the electrolyte solution before and after the electrolysis were measured as 14.00 and 13.95, respectively. The pH change was not obvious, indicating that maybe no acidic species (such as HCOOH or H2CO3) were generated during the electrolysis. Finally, Ba(NO3)2 saturated aqueous solution was added to the electrolyte solution after electrolysis; white precipitation was formed and it was not soluble with the addition of nitric acid (Fig. S20†), proving the presence of SO42− in the solution and indicating the S element in the catalyst was probably oxidized into SO42− and entered into the solution during the electrolysis process. The detailed mechanism is under investigation.
To understand the reason for the decrease in the electrocatalytic activity of RuO2 and Pt for the OER during the electrolysis experiment, we also characterized the two noble metallic catalysts before and after the durability test. As shown in Fig. S21a and c,† the sizes of the RuO2 and Pt particles before electrolysis were ca. 20 and 100 nm, respectively. However, after the 6 h-electrolysis experiment, their sizes were greater than 100 nm (Fig. S21b and d†), indicating they were aggregated to some extent during the electrocatalytic process for OER.
In conclusion, our catalyst is a Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C hybrid, in which the cobalt compounds such as Co9S8, CoS and CoO are the main active components for the OER, and the amorphous carbon acts as the support for the electron transfer to avoid the aggregation of the active components.
The band gap of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs
Generally, since metal oxides are semiconductors, it was expected that the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C hybrid would possess semiconductor characteristics. In order to investigate the photoelectrochemical properties of the catalyst, the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs was obtained in comparison to the Co-MOF precursor. As shown in Fig. S22,† the Co-MOF displays a UV absorption peak at 274 nm, which may correspond to the π–π* transition. The absorption peak at 548 nm is ascribed to the visible d–d transition.26 The Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs exhibit a completely different absorption spectrum, which displays UV and visible absorption peaks at 350 and 614/760 nm, all of which are red shifted in comparison to those of the bulk Co-MOF, indicating that the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs possess better UV-vis absorption properties with respect to the Co-MOF precursor.
The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS) of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C nanoparticles was also measured. The band gap of the catalyst nanoparticles was determined from the absorption edge that was converted from the reflectance spectrum via the transformed Kubelka–Munk equation (see ESI† for the band gap extraction method).63 As shown in Fig. S23,† the experimentally determined band gap of the sample is 1.15 eV, suggesting the semiconducting character of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C nanoparticles.
In order to further investigate the optoelectronic properties of the sample, the band structures and orbital calculations for the individual components, Co9S8, CoS and CoO, as well as the possible products of OER, Co(OH)2 and CoOOH were calculated by the CASTEP program based on density functional theory (DFT). Due to the Co(II) ion possessing the configuration of 3d7, spin-polarized calculations were performed.64–68 The electronic band structures of the spin-polarized Co9S8, CoS, Co(OH)2 and CoOOH are shown in Fig. S24–S27,† respectively. It was found that one or more bands were seen crossing the Fermi level for both spins in the band structures of Co9S8, CoS, Co(OH)2 and CoOOH (Fig. S24–S27†), indicating the two cobalt sulfides and the two cobalt hydroxides are probably metallic, because DFT calculated bandgap values tend to be generally lower than the corresponding experimentally determined values.
The calculated band structure of the spin-polarized monoclinic CoO is shown in Fig. 13, where an indirect-gap of about 0.55 eV around the Fermi energy exists for the majority (up-spin) of electrons, while the Fermi level occurs in the bands of the minority spin (down-spin), suggesting the up-spin and down-spin band structures of the CoO display semiconducting and metallic features, respectively, indicating that the monoclinic CoO possesses a striking feature, which is the opening of a gap at the Fermi level and it is induced by spin-polarization. In contrast, when the spin-unpolarized calculation was performed for the CoO (see Fig. S28 in the ESI†), a high density of states at the Fermi level was observed, indicating the metallic characteristics of the spin-unpolarized CoO.
 Fig. 13  Band structure of the spin-polarized monoclinic CoO. The blue and red curves correspond to the spin up and down bands, respectively (a). The calculated TDOS (black) and PDOS of the spin-polarized CoO. The positive and negative values express the spin-up and spin-down states, respectively. In the PDOS, red and green lines represent O 2p and Co 3d orbitals, respectively (b). The Fermi level is set to zero. 
Herein, the band gap of 0.55 eV for the majority (up-spin) electrons of the CoO is a bit lower than the experimentally determined band gap (1.13 eV) of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C nanoparticles, which is attributed to two factors: firstly, DFT calculations generally underestimate the band gap energy of semiconductors, which is intrinsically related to certain DFT limitations, namely not taking into account the discontinuity in the exchange–correlation potential.69,70 Secondly, with the decrease in the size of the particle, the quantum confinement effect is maximized, which tends to increase the band gap of the sample.71,72
The total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) plots for the spin-polarized CoO are shown in Fig. 13b. The DOS for the majority (up-spin) and minority spin (down-spin) are shown in the positive and negative values, respectively (Fig. 13b). It was found that a continuous DOS occurs around the Fermi level for the minority electrons (Fig. 13b, bottom), and an unambiguous gap was observed for the DOS of the majority spin (Fig. 13b, up), further indicating the metallic and semiconducting characteristics of the spin-polarized CoO.
As shown in Fig. 13b and S29,† both the valence and conduction densities near the Fermi level for the minority electrons (down-spin) are mainly composed of the Co 3d and O 2p orbitals, and the contributions of the Co 3d and O 2p states to the valence band maximum (VBM) for the majority electrons (up-spin) are also predominant. However, the Co 3d state almost doesn't give a contribution to the conduction band minimum (CBM) for the majority electrons (up-spin), leading to an energy gap of ca. 0.55 eV in the majority band. The analysis also proves that the band gap is derived from the spin states of the Co 3d electrons.
The photoresponse of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs
The photoelectrochemical behavior of the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPs was investigated in a three-electrode cell by using the sample-modified FTO slide, a platinum plate and a Ag/AgCl electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The three-electrode system was put in a two-necked reactor made of quartz, with cooling water to keep the temperature constant. The light irradiation was from the front side of the working electrode in 1 M KOH aqueous solution (50 mL) with a 300 W xenon lamp as the light source (650 nm > λ > 350 nm, 100 mA cm−2). As shown in Fig. 14, the CV curves at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 with and without light irradiation indicate that the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C nanoparticles display smaller onset OER potential (1.00 V vs. RHE) with illumination, with respect to that (1.07 V vs. RHE) without illumination. Enhanced OER current density was observed in the presence of light irradiation (Fig. 14).

The stability test of the photoelectrode was performed at E = 1.07 V vs. RHE. As shown in Fig. 15, the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C nanoparticles exhibited a clear photoresponse to the visible light irradiation (350 nm < λ < 650 nm), with the largest current density of ca. 1.2 × 10−3 mA cm2. No obvious decline in the photocurrent was observed as time increased, indicating that the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C nanoparticles have good photostability. The optoelectronic properties of the sample are probably associated with the spin-polarized semiconducting behavior of the CoO in the sample; it is also associated with the quantum confinement effect of nanoparticles, which tends to increase the band gap. The detailed mechanism is under investigation.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the charge transfer and recombination on the interface between the sample-modified FTO and the electrolyte. Fig. S30† shows that the Nyquist plots at E = 1.07 V vs. RHE contain a semicircle in the high-frequency region, followed by a straight line in the low-frequency region with and without the visible light irradiation (650 nm > λ > 350 nm, 100 mW cm−2). It can be seen that the diameter of the semicircle with irradiation is smaller than that without irradiation, indicating a smaller charge transfer resistance in the presence of illumination. The results further prove that the visible light irradiation can promote charge transfer at the interface.
Conclusion
In summary, based on a Co-MOF, Co(H2L)2(H2O)2·2DMF, Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C nanoparticles were synthesized via a one-step low-temperature annealing method. The C and S elements in the Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C nanoparticles both came from the organic ligand in the Co-MOF, since there were no extra carbon and sulfur sources during the calcination process. The Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C hybrid material can act as a good electrocatalyst for the OER in alkaline media with a lower overpotential than RuO2 (0.37 V) and Pt nanoparticles (0.60 V). The better electrocatalytic activity of the hybrid material is associated with its nanosize (ca. 5–20 nm) and its heterojunction structure, in which the four moieties, Co9S8, CoS, CoO and C are supported together. The strong electron coupling interactions among the three crystalline Co compounds and the amorphous carbon give rise to a superior synergistic effect. The interconnected amorphous carbon, except for anchoring and dispersing the active sites of the Co compounds to avoid aggregation, also serve as highly conducting channels for the electron transfer. Furthermore, the cobalt compounds are the active species in the catalyst during the OER process, and they were converted into CoOOH and Co(OH)2 in the KOH electrolyte, and the S element in the catalyst entered into the solution during the OER process. The Co9S8@CoS@CoO@C NPS can exhibit the best OER activity with minimum overpotential (η = 0.028 V) to afford a stable OER current density after activation in KOH aqueous solution. The sample also showed obvious photoresponse to the visible light irradiation (350 nm < λ < 650 nm, 100 mW cm−2) with enhanced OER current density and lowered onset potential. This can probably be ascribed to the opening of a gap at the Fermi level for the majority of electrons (up-spin), which is induced by the spin-polarization of the CoO. Meanwhile, the photoresponse is also associated with the quantum confinement effect of nanoparticles, which tends to increase the band gap. The detailed mechanism is under investigation.
