    , Accepted 18th May 2022First published on 19th May 2022AbstractDespite considerable progress in the field of sustainable ammonia technology, the low efficiency and yield have remained the main bottleneck in artificial nitrogen fixation under ambient conditions. In this work, an ultrathin carbon quantum dot modified hydrogenated mesoporous SrTiO3 heterostructure (CQDs/STO) has been developed as a bifunctional catalyst for enhanced nitrogen reduction. CQDs/STO exhibits a high photocatalytic activity and an ammonia yield of 143 μmol g−1 h−1 has been achieved without any sacrificial reagent, which is about 7 times that of STO nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CQDs/STO can be utilized as a bifunctional catalyst for cascade photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction, resulting in a ∼50% increase in the ammonia yield. DFT calculations reveal that the synergy between SrTiO3 and CQDs has the capability for photocatalytic reduction of N2 with the O-vacancies in SrTiO3 playing a key role also as electrocatalytic centers. We believe that such a cascade catalytic system provides a new insight into designing photoelectrochemical devices for solar-driven nitrogen fixation.
Introduction
Nitrogen fixation, a process by which elemental nitrogen is converted into ammonia, is essential for all living things because nitrogen is needed to biosynthesize basic building blocks of plants, animals, and other life forms.1 Although natural nitrogen fixation by nitrogenases occurs under ambient conditions, dinitrogen is highly stable and chemically inert with a high dissociation energy of 911 kJ mol−1. Industrially, the N2 cleavage process is a heavily energy intensive process, accompanied by serious CO2 emission. Thus, there is growing interest in alternative and sustainable approaches to ammonia synthesis. Artificial photosynthesis provides a promising alternative to the reduction of nitrogen into ammonia directly by using solar energy.2–13 In photocatalytic nitrogen fixation, energetic electrons are involved in the nitrogen reduction reaction, whereas energetic holes participate in the oxygen-evolution reaction. From a thermodynamics point of view, a single photocatalyst can hardly meet the requirements for both nitrogen reduction and water oxidation reactions due to the high dissociation energy involved in both reactions. In this regard, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) process has the advantage of transferring both direct and indirect solar energy into chemical bonds for nitrogen reduction. The photon excited electrode is capable of breaking the strong triple bond of nitrogen molecules at a lower overpotential, which in turn suppresses the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction and hence promotes the energy efficiency.14 However, the photoelectrode usually cannot harvest solar energy efficiently due to the limitation of mass transfer and light absorption on immobilized photocatalysts in comparison with those suspended in solution. Therefore, a combination of the PEC and photocatalytic process may be a choice to boost the yield and efficiency for solar driven nitrogen reduction.
The properties of photocatalytic materials, such as selectivity, chemical stability, N2 adsorption, and light absorption ability are crucial in PEC nitrogen reduction systems. As a typical perovskite material, SrTiO3 (STO) is known as a promising photocatalyst in the CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions due to its negative conduction band edge and high photochemical stability.15–17 However, the relatively wide band gap (3.2 eV) of STO retards its further application in the visible region (λ > 410 nm). Hence, coupling a narrow-gap semiconductor to STO can result in an increase in visible light adsorption as well as charge separation. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a member of narrow-gap semiconductor materials, possessing many unique and novel properties due to their ultrasmall size, unique quantum confinement, and excellent conductivity.18–21 The electronic structure of semiconductor nanomaterials can be manipulated through inducing vacancies or element doping, which is extremely important in both photocatalytic and electrocatalytic processes.22–26 In this work, we designed a new cascade system based on CQD modified hydrogenated mesoporous STO nanoparticles (CQDs/STO) for the PEC nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). The CQDs/STO heterostructure acts as an electrocatalyst as well as a visible light photocatalyst in solution, resulting in high catalytic performance in the reduction of atmospheric N2 to ammonia with high yield and high stability.
Experimental
Preparation of STO, CQDs and CQDs/STO catalysts
All reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Mesoporous STO nanoparticles were prepared via the hydrothermal reaction of titanium butoxide (TBOT, 99.0%, Aladdin) (3 mmol), strontium chloride hexahydrate (SrCl2·6H2O, 99.5% Aladdin) (3 mmol), N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (C8H21NOSi2, 95% Aladdin) (2 mmol) and 2 M NaOH, as described previously.27 Then, the hydrogenation of STO nanoparticles was carried out in a hydrogen atmosphere at 1000 °C for 2 h. CQDs were synthesized by an electrochemical method in Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm−1, 500 mL) by using graphite rods (99.99%, diameter about 0.5 cm) as both the anode and cathode. The electrochemical synthesis was carried out using a DC power supply with the current intensity in the range of 10–200 mA cm−2 at room temperature. The CQDS/STO samples were prepared by a deposition method. 180.0 mg of STO was dispersed in 10 mL of ultra-pure water and sonicated for 30 min. Then certain volumes of anhydrous ethanol, Nafion (5 wt%) and CQD solution were added into the solution and sonicated for 30 min followed by heating at 125 °C for 2 h in a vacuum oven.
Materials characterization
The materials were characterized by using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation (25 mA and 40 kV), a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi Corporation, FESEM SU8220), an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Company, Tian ETEM G2 80-300). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a spectrophotometer in the range of 200–800 nm (UV-Vis, PerkinElmer Lambda 650). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization studies were carried out on a Thermal ESCALA 250i X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments were performed at 77 K with a physisorption analyzer (ASAP 2020MC, Micromeritics, Norcross, GA).
Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction
Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction was carried out at ambient temperature and pressure. A 300 W Xe lamp was used as an artificial solar light source, while the illumination intensity was 1 sun (100 MW cm−2). The 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution used in the photocatalytic experiment was bubbled with pure nitrogen for 1 h prior to each test. For each test, 10 mg photocatalyst was dispersed in 100 mL 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution and sonicated for 30 min in the dark to ensure homogeneity. During photo-reduction, the reaction solution was constantly stirred and the nitrogen flow rate was 10 mL min−1. An aliquot of the reaction solution was collected every 1 h, and the photocatalyst was centrifuged before ammonia detection. The quantum efficiency (QE) was measured, and the QE was calculated according to the following equation: (1)where NA is Avogadro's constant, n represents the amount of NH3 generation, I represents the illumination intensity, A is the irradiation area, t is the photoreaction reaction time, λ represents the wavelength, and h and c are the Planck constant and speed of light, respectively.
PEC nitrogen reduction
The PEC catalytic NRR was conducted with an electrochemical workstation (Autolab 86327) under ambient conditions. A 300 W Xe lamp was used as an artificial solar light source, while the illumination intensity was 1 sun. A double-chamber H-type cell was used, which was separated by a Celgard #3401 membrane under ambient conditions. The saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and carbon rod were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. A customized electrode (1 cm × 1 cm, carbon cloth) was used as the working electrode. The catalyst ink was prepared using a mixture of 1.5 mL 0.05 M Nafion diluted by using isopropanol, 0.5 mL deionized water, and 3 mg catalyst. Catalyst ink was dropped on the electrode after sonication for 30 min, and the as-prepared catalyst loading on the electrode was 2 mg cm−2. PEC nitrogen reduction was carried out in 50 mL of 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. The solution was bubbled with pure nitrogen for 60 min to remove the dissolved oxygen prior to each test. During the photoelectrochemical reduction process, the reaction solution was under magnetic stirring with a N2 flow rate at 10 mL min−1. For the cascade catalytic N2 reduction experiments, all the procedures are the same as the above except for the addition of 1 mg mL−1 of CQDs/STO in the electrolyte.
Determination of ammonia
The ammonia product was quantitatively determined by the indophenol blue method. Briefly, 1 mL of sample solution was mixed with 250 μL oxidizing solution containing 60 μmol NaOH and 7.75 μmol NaClO. Then 250 μL coloring solution containing 0.312 mmol sodium salicylate (C7H5NaO3, 99.5%, Aladdin), 0.060 mmol NaOH and 0.665 μmol sodium nitroferricyanide dihydrate (Na2[Fe(CN)5NO]·2H2O, 99.0%, Aladdin) was added. The mixed solution was kept in a dark place under ambient conditions for 3 h before UV-vis measurement. The adsorption peak of indophenol at around 655 nm was recorded and used for the calculation of the amount of ammonia produced. A known concentration of ammonium chloride solution was prepared to make standard curves and the concentration–absorbance curve was used to estimate the NH3 concentrations (Fig. S3†). Labelled 15N2 gas was used to further confirm that the ammonia produced is from the N2 gas supplied to the experiment. The ammonia produced was quantified by using a 1H-NMR measurement on a Bruker NMR600 as follows. The 1H NMR signal of 15NH4+ is split by the nuclear spin of 15N into a well-known doublet (∼73 Hz) in the region near 7.0 ppm, while 14N produces a triplet (∼52 Hz) in the same region.28 The signals are of different sensitivities.29,30 To increase the utilization of 15N2 gas and remove the contaminants in 15N2 gas, a gas circulation system was utilized to perform the isotopic labelling experiment, as described previously.31 The photoelectrocatalytic and cascade photoelectrocatalytic 15N2 reduction experiments were performed at −0.3 V (vs. RHE). The reaction time was kept for 4 hours. The product was qualitatively monitored using 1H-NMR with d6-DMSO as a reference. The sample volume in the NMR experiment was 0.8 mL containing 20 vol% d6-DMSO solutions.
DFT investigation
All structures have been modeled by means of density functional theory (DFT) through generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.32 Over these optimized geometries, band alignment calculations were performed using the Hyed–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional (with 0.25 factor of exchange parameter), given the good harmony of this method between the hypothesized theoretical results with the experimental band gap and band energy positions for a variety of photocatalytic materials.33 In addition to the analysis of the photocatalytic properties of the materials, the potential role of STO as a nitrogen reduction reaction electrocatalyst has been performed at the PBE level of theory, including Grimme’s D3 dispersion corrections. All optimization, vibrational frequency, and single point calculations have been performed through the facilities provided by the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP, version 5.4.4).34,35 The computational details are shown in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
Characterization of CQDs/STO
The preparation process of the CQDs/STO heterostructure is schematically shown in Fig. S1.† First, STO was prepared by a one-pot solvothermal method followed by a hydrogenation process. Then, the CQDs were loaded onto STO using a deposition method. The SEM images are shown in Fig. 1a. In contrast to conventional cube shaped STO nanoparticles (Fig. S2†), STO exhibits an irregular shape and rough surface with a size of about 200 nm. The high angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image reveals that STO has a size of about 5–6 nm (Fig. S3†). Fig. 1b shows the TEM possesses a rough surface with uniformly distributed mesopore images of the CQDs. The CQDs are well dispersed with a size of about 200 nm. The high angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image reveals that STO possesses a rough surface with uniformly distributed mesopores with a size of about 5–6 nm (Fig. S4†). Fig. 1b shows the TEM images of the CQDs. The CQDs are well dispersed with sizes ranging from 4 to 5 nm. A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image is shown in the inset of Fig. 1b, where the well-resolved lattice spacings of 0.21 nm correspond to the (100) atomic planes of graphite. The TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the CQDs/STO heterostructure are shown in Fig. 1c and d. The well-recognized lattice spacings of 0.28 and 0.21 nm correspond to the (110) atomic planes of perovskite STO and the (100) atomic plane of CQDs, respectively. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping images clearly show the distribution of elemental Sr, Ti, O and C in CQDs/STO (Fig. 1e). The uniformly distributed C indicates that CQDs have been successfully incorporated onto STO. The EDS analysis also evidences an apparent oxygen deficiency in STO.

Fig. 2a shows the XRD spectra of STO and the CQDs/STO heterostructure. All the diffraction peaks are distinguishable and can be perfectly indexed as the cubic perovskite structure of bulk STO. A broad prominent peak is centered at around 27 degrees, which could be attributed to the (002) planes of CQDs.36,37 The N2 sorption isotherms of CQDs/STO and STO are shown in Fig. 2b. The pore size distribution curve (inset, Fig. 2b) shows that the samples have a very clear mesoporous structure with the pore size centered at about 6 nm, which is consistent with the TEM observation. Fig. 2c shows the XPS survey spectra of CQDs/STO. The Ti 2p spectra of SrTiO3 can be divided into two peaks at 458.5 and 459.0 eV, respectively (Fig. 2d). The peak at 459.0 eV represents the binding energy of lattice Ti4+, while the peak at 458.5 eV is attributed to lattice Ti3+ resulting from the hydrogenation process. The asymmetric O 1s peak on the surface of STO is coherently fitted by two Gaussian components, centered at 530.2 and 531.4 eV, respectively (Fig. 2e), corresponding to the O2− ions in the lattice and oxygen vacancies in the oxygen deficient regions, respectively.38 The electronic structure of perovskite SrTiO3 consists of a valence band of predominantly occupied O 2p states and a conduction band of predominantly unoccupied Ti 3d states, respectively.27 Previous studies have suggested that the oxygen vacancy defect introduces a localized state comprised of 3dz2 and 4pz orbitals of the adjacent Ti atoms. This results in a bound state about 0.7–1.2 eV below the conduction band edge.39,40 Electrons can be excited to the oxygen vacancy states from a valence band with lower irradiation energy. There are certain amounts of Ti3+ on the surface. These surface Ti3+ species could behave as active sites for the adsorption of N2via the electron donation from Ti3+.41 The C 1s peaks can be deconvoluted into four peaks (Fig. 2f), corresponding to C–C, C–O, –CO, and –COOH at 284.8, 286.5, 288.0, and 290.1 eV, respectively.42

The photocatalytic performance of the CQDs/STO heterostructure

Fig. 3a shows the optical absorption spectra of STO and CQDs/STO. STO nanoparticles show a band edge at a wavelength of 380 nm, corresponding to a band gap of 3.26 eV. A remarkable red shift with a band edge near 460 nm can be observed on CQDs/STO, corresponding to 2.69 eV. Compared to STO, CQDs/STO exhibits significantly enhanced light absorption over the wavelength range of 400–800 nm. The photocatalytic performance of the STO and CQDs/STO samples was investigated in N2-saturated 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution for the nitrogen reduction reaction. Significantly, CQDs/STO exhibits an ammonia yield of 143 μmol g−1 h−1, which is about 7 times that of STO nanoparticles (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3c shows ammonia production as a function of time, and the ammonia yield increases with the irradiation time during a 6 h test. The excellent photocatalytic performance of CQDs/STO is also evidenced in another 6-cycle stability test (Fig. S5†). The control experiments were also performed in an Ar atmosphere and N2 atmosphere without light illumination, and the ammonia yields were negligible (Fig. S6†). Quantum efficiency experiments for ammonia production were measured at450 and 500 nm. As shown in Fig. 3d, the quantum efficiency of CQDs/STO is nearly four times as high as that of pure STO, suggesting that carbon quantum dot decorated STO provides an additional photoexcitation mechanism that can improve ammonia yield. During the photocatalytic NRR process, the CQD/STO heterostructure is photo-excited and produces electron–hole pairs; the electrons are consumed in nitrogen reduction to NH3 on the STO surface, while the CQDs act as a hole acceptor for oxidizing H2O to O2. Benefitting from its large surface area, the mesoporous STO surface enhances optical and nitrogen adsorption and provides stable substrates for the loading of CQDs. It can be inferred that CQDs play a critical role in photocatalytic nitrogen reduction due to its narrow band gap for visible light adsorption and high conductivity for the NRR. Besides, the CQDs/STO heterostructure allows an efficient separation of photogenerated holes and electrons and facilitates nitrogen adsorption, dissociation, and reduction.

The PEC performance of the CQDs/STO heterostructure
The CQDs/STO heterostructure was investigated for the PEC nitrogen reduction reaction in N2-saturated 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. In the cascade photoelectrochemical cell, CQDs/STO was used as a bifunctional catalyst for simultaneous photoelectrocatalysis and photocatalysis (Fig. 4a). The linear sweep voltammetry curves of STO and CQDs/STO are shown in Fig. 4b. A remarkable current increase from STO to CQDs/STO in the more negative region can be observed. The Faraday efficiency (FE) and yield of ammonia as a function of potential are plotted in Fig. 4c and d. The ammonia yield and the maximum FE for the CQDs/STO catalyst are 22.37 μg cm−2 h−1 and 10.2% at −0.30 V (vs. RHE), respectively. The FE decreases with the increase of negative potential, which can be attributed to the increased selectivity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. In the cascade PEC cell, the ammonia yield is 32.56 μg cm−2 h−1 at −0.30 V (vs. RHE), which increases by about 50% compared to that obtained in the PEC cell without the presence of an CQDs/STO photocatalyst in the solution. The durability experiment results of the bifunctional catalyst are shown in Fig. 4e. After six cycles, the respective ammonia yield and FE are 31.3 μg cm−2 h−1 and 9.51% at −0.30 V (vs. RHE), exhibiting a stable PEC performance. In order to verify the origin of generated ammonia, an isotope labelling experiment was performed by using isotopic 15N2 as a nitrogen source. As shown in Fig. 4f, the detected 15NH4+ from the product solution verifies the role of 15N2 as the nitrogen source. This result, in combination with the outcome of the control experiments (Fig. S5†), validates ammonia production from nitrogen reduction.

The catalytic mechanism of a cascade PEC system
To further explore the catalytic mechanism of a cascade PEC system, the interaction between the incident light and catalytic surface was investigated. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra are shown in Fig. 5a, and it can be clearly seen that peaks centered at ∼390 nm are observed for all samples, which corresponds to the deep level emission generated by the recombination of charge carriers in a material.43 The higher the intensity of the PL spectrum, the more dominant is the electron and hole recombination.44 As expected, CQDs/STO photocatalysts display a quenched PL intensity compared to STO, indicating that the recombination of electrons and holes is suppressed, which favors the PEC activity. The Raman spectra of CQDs/STO and STO are shown in Fig. 5b. The bands at ∼200 and 730 cm−1 correspond to second order Raman scattering, while the Eg mode at 98 cm−1 and TiO2 bonding modes at 168 and 520 cm−1 are attributed to first order Raman scattering, which results from structural defects such as oxygen vacancies and strain in the perovskite nanocrystals.27 The Raman peaks of CQDs/STO at 1354 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 are assigned to the disordered (D) band and graphite (G) band, respectively. The intensity ratio (ID/IG) of the D band and G band is about 0.92, revealing substantial surface defects. For a 5 nm CQD, about 20% of the carbon atoms are on the surface. The surface defects would play an important role in the photocatalytic performance.

The surface functional groups of STO, CQDs and CQDs/STO were investigated by FT-IR spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 5c, both CQDs and CQDs/STO show two sharp peaks at 1718 cm−1 and 1247 cm−1 and a broad absorption band centered at 2992 cm−1, which are attributed to the stretching vibrations of CO, C–O and the in-plane bending vibration of C–H in CQDs.42,45 The broad absorption bands in the 3300–3700 cm−1 range are attributed to the stretching vibrations of O–H. These results indicate that the CQD surface is functionalized by –OH and –COOH, which is beneficial to the performance of catalysis.46 The similar characteristic bands in both CQDs and CQDs/STO suggest a strong coupling between the CQDs and STO. Fig. 5d shows the Nyquist impedance plots of CQDs/STO with and without 1 sun irradiation. Significant differences in the impedance spectra can be observed in the high-frequency regions, which correspond to the electron transfer limited process. The decrease in the Rct reveals a photo-induced conductivity, which improves the electron transfer kinetics. The photocurrent transient response tests of STO and CQDs/STO were carried out under 1 sun irradiation. CQDs/STO exhibits 2.5 times the photocurrent of STO (Fig. 5e). This significantly enhanced photoconductivity and photocurrent can be attributed to the visible light adsorption and high conductivity of CQDs. In the cascade PEC catalytic system, both photocatalytic and electrocatalytic processes contribute to nitrogen reduction, enhancing the ammonia yield. Besides, some of the nitrogen molecules in the electrolyte may be photoactivated before they reach the cathode, which facilitates the consequent kinetics for nitrogen reduction.
The density functional theory (DFT) investigation reveals different photocatalytic features of STO, CQD, and the composite material. The optimized structures of the models are shown in Fig. S7,† and both STO(110) and (200) are flat surfaces, exposing the respective Sr and Ti atoms only. On the contrary, the (211) facet is a stepped surface, exposing both Sr and Ti atoms. None of the (110)-, (200)-, and (211)-oriented slabs of STO are characterized to possess valence band (VB) edges below the N2/NH3 pair (0.058 V vs. NHE). Fig. 6 shows the band gaps of different surfaces, revealing an anisotropic nature of the facets in the semiconductor properties of STO. Interestingly, the presence of O-vacancies in the (200) facet of STO experiences a shift in both valence and conduction band (CB) edges, placing the CB edge at −4.75 eV (vs. vacuum) at the HSE06/PBE level of theory below the N2/NH3 pair. This aspect is of special relevance since it reveals the key role that O-vacancies play, i.e., an enriched O-vacancy (200) facet seems to be responsible for promoting the decay of the excited electron for the photocatalytic reduction of N2. For the building of the CQD, we have proposed a model constituted by four π-stacked CQD sheets with 1 nm size (Fig. S7†). A calculated band gap of 2.78 eV is seen for this material, which should be compared with the 3.2 eV of bulk STO. This CQD model exhibits a VB edge above the N2/NH3 pair, only being active when composited with STO. In this case, the VB edge at −4.41 eV vs. vacuum decreases to −4.63 eV and −4.66 eV when the CQD is coupled with STO(200) and STO(200)-Ovac, respectively, showing band gaps of 2.78 eV and a narrower value of 2.61 eV, in each case. Against these data, it can be hypothesized that the heterostructure of STO with CQDs can promote the photocatalytic reduction of N2 into NH3 through the (200) surface of STO but more actively in the presence of O-vacancies.
 Fig. 6  VBM/CBM energy positions at the HSE06/PBE level of theory for the optimized (110)-, (211)-, and (200)-oriented STO slabs, (200) with one O-vacancy, a representative CQD structure, and composite CQD/STO materials relative to vacuum and the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). 
The plausible role of these materials as NRR electrocatalysts has been also examined at the PBE + D3 level of theory.47 Based on the calculations, only those structures including the (200) facet of STO in the presence of O-vacancies are capable of catalyzing this reaction. Here, we consider the presence of two O-vacancies on the STO(200) surface. In the first scenario (Fig. S8†), a model with two O-vacancies in parallel has been considered, exposing four fold-coordinated Ti atoms. In this case, the O-vacancies make the Ti atoms electropositive, and N2 adsorption is spontaneous, with −0.15 eV of binding free energy. This corroborates the potential role of the O-vacancies as enhancers for the interaction of N2 with the catalytic surface, being an especially relevant aspect regarding the potential use of surface-modified metallic oxides as NRR electrocatalysts. This stabilization is also seen in the N2H intermediate species, exhibiting a thermodynamics impediment of just 0.19 eV with respect to *N2. In these circumstances, the rate-determining step is the reduction of *N2 into *NH2 into ammonia with 0.90 eV of energy requirement. Additional calculations contemplating two O-vacancies in line (Fig. S9†), i.e., generating two four-coordinated Ti atoms and one very defective three-coordinated Ti atom, which increases the adsorption capabilities of N2, exhibiting a spontaneous N2 adsorption with an energy of −0.54 eV. The energy barrier for the rate-determining step of the formation of *NHNH intermediate species is 0.71 eV.
Finally, the catalytic role of the CQD/STO heterostructure consisting of an STO(200) slab with one O-vacancy and the four π-stacked CQD sheets has been investigated. As shown in Fig. 7, it can be seen that there is the generation of a catalytic cavity between the CQD and the O-vacancy site. Such a catalytic cavity generates a hydrophobic pocket, which is beneficial for N2 adsorption and activation. The electrochemical performance of the CQD/STO heterostructure for the NRR shows a very similar catalytic behavior to that seen for STO(200) with two O-vacancies in parallel, and the formation of the elusive N2H species is the rate-determining step of the whole process. The only differentiating mechanistic aspect between these two processes is in the fact that HNNH seems to be unstable in the hydrophobic site of CQD/STO(200)-Ovac, forming the N–NH2 intermediate species instead of HNNH during the second hydrogenation step. It is worth noting that the energy requirement in the formation of N2H species is 0.52 eV, which is lower than that of pure STO(200) containing O-vacancies, suggesting a higher catalytic activity.
 Fig. 7  Proposed reaction mechanism for electrochemical N2 conversion into NH3 catalyzed by the composite of the CQD and the STO(200) surface with one O-vacancy. Note: reaction free energies at room temperature are shown in eV when there is no applied potential (U = 0) and pH = 0. 
Conclusions
In summary, a new cascade system by using a metal-free catalyst based on carbon quantum dots coupled with hydrogenated mesoporous STO has been developed for nitrogen fixation under ambient conditions. In the cascade PEC system, CQDs/STO acted as a bifunctional catalyst for simultaneous photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic nitrogen reduction. DFT calculations suggest that the catalytic conversion of N2 into NH3 is promoted by the heterostructured CQD/STO and the defective STO(200) surface with O-vacancies. In addition, a dual catalytic effect is hypothesized since the STO(200) surface with O-vacancies is also capable of electrochemically converting N2 into NH3. This work provides inspiration for promoting solar-driven photoelectrochemical nitrogen fixation. This simple approach also has the potential for other applications such as water splitting and environmental remediation.
