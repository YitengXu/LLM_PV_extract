, Accepted 23rd July 2013First published on 24th July 2013AbstractTo develop environmentally friendly solvent processed high performance polymer solar cells (PSCs), an alcohol soluble narrow-band-gap conjugated polymer PCDTBT-N and an alcohol soluble C70 fullerene derivative PC71BM-N, which were functionalized with pendant tertiary amino groups, were developed and used as active layers in PSCs and as buffer layers in metal–semiconductor interfaces. Though solar cells with active layers containing amino groups showed no photovoltaic properties regardless of the processing conditions, both PCDTBT-N and PC71BM-N performed well as buffer layers to improve electron collection in PSCs. Space charge limited current (SCLC), field effect transistor (FET) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies revealed that the amino groups act as hole traps and disable hole transport in active layers. Moreover, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) indicates electronic structure changes and Fermi level shifts upon complexation of amino groups and the fullerene core, which may diminish the electron-accepting capacity of fullerenes, and may potentially provide a different kind of hole trap in the devices. The underlying mechanisms of the puzzling behavior of PCDTBT-N and PC71BM-N in different layers of PSCs were studied by numerical simulation, which indicates that hole traps distributed in the BHJ layer reduce device performance, conversely hole traps concentrated near the metal electrode can improve device performance. Besides, the formation of an amino group:C70 complex is another important cause of the performance improvements of the resulting solar cells using PCDTBT-N and PC71BM-N as buffer layers, due to the reduced transport loss for efficient electron collection through the n-doping of PC71BM at the interface of the buffer layer and the active layer.

Broader context
The bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cell (PSC) is a promising renewable energy source due to its advantages of low-cost, lightweight, and mechanical flexibility and its potential of developing into large area modules by solution processing. Significant improvements in efficiencies of PSCs have been achieved, but the film forming process for high efficiency PSCs almost exclusively involved with toxic organic solvents. Toward “green solvent” processed PSCs, an alcohol soluble photovoltaic polymer and an alcohol soluble C70 fullerene derivative, which were functionalized with amino group(s) were developed. Despite the positive expectation, photovoltaic studies showed that the solar cells based on this amine-containing conjugated polymer/fullerene blend did not exhibit any photovoltaic response. In-depth studies disclosed the hole trap nature of amine itself and the complexation of amine and the fullerene core. Further investigations revealed that the accumulation of such hole traps and the complexation of amine:fullerene at the metal/semiconductor interface are important causes of the excellent modification properties of the widely used water–alcohol soluble interfacial materials. This contribution not only sheds light on the essentials of developing “green solvent” processable photovoltaic materials, but also provides new insights into the underlying working mechanisms of the widely used water–alcohol soluble interfacial materials.

Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention and exhibited great potential as low-cost, lightweight, high throughput green and sustainable energy sources.1–4 Efficient PSCs typically employ a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive layer, where an electron-donating phase and an electron-accepting phase form a nano-sized phase-separated interpenetrating network, which can provide large enough hetero-interface areas for efficient exciton dissociation and a continuous pathway for charge transport.1 In recent years, significant progress in materials exploration and device engineering has pushed the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs up to the commercialization threshold.5–39 Nevertheless, the film forming process for high efficiency PSCs almost exclusively involved with toxic organic solvents (such as chlorobenzene (CB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), chloroform, etc.). From the perspective of high throughput industrial manufacturing, using these toxic organic solvents in the fabrication of PSCs will not only increase the cost for production, but be also harmful to the health of the workers, and is undesirable from the perspective of the environment. Growing efforts have thus been made on developing environmentally friendly processing technologies for solar cells.40–50 Until now, there have been two popular approaches to fabricate PSCs from environmentally friendly solvents. One is to employ water–alcohol soluble ionic organic materials to form a photoactive layer by layer-by-layer deposition or spin-coating.40–42 The other involves the preparation of aqueous nanoparticle dispersions of hydrophobic materials through microemulsion techniques and the deposition of these aqueous dispersions to form a photoactive layer.43–46 Despite these efforts, we lack a suitable “green solvent” alternative to PSCs. For the former, the ionic groups and counterions are potential traps or quenching points for charge carriers. While for the latter, the nanoparticles' size (>50 nm) is usually much larger than the ideal exciton diffusion distance (∼10 to 20 nm), and the surface coverage insulating agents on nanoparticles may be charge traps as well.
Water–alcohol soluble conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives work well as buffer layers in PSCs.29,32,34,38,51–66 Specifically, poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN),67 the polymer bearing pendant neutral tertiary amino groups, has helped to realize the state-of-the-art of single junction PSCs.29,34 Taking these considerations into account, a direct idea is the development of a neutral tertiary amino group functionalized narrow-band-gap conjugated polymer and a fullerene derivative for environmentally friendly processed PSCs. The neutral tertiary amino groups will not only endow the resulting materials' solubility in alcohols, but will also avoid possible complications by ionic groups and free counterions.67 Integrating amino-functionalized materials may also be beneficial for simplifying the device structure due to the previously established interface optimization.29,34 A new narrow-band-gap conjugated polymer poly{N-7′-[(1′,13′-bis(N′,N′-diethylamino)tridecanyl)]-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)} (PCDTBT-N) and a new fullerene derivative N,N-diethyl-5-phenyl-5-[(6′,6′)-C71-pentyl]-1-amine (PC71BM-N) (see Scheme 1) functionalized with pendant aliphatic tertiary amino group(s) were thus designed and synthesized. Despite expectations, photovoltaic studies showed that the devices based on the PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N BHJ layer did not exhibit any photovoltaic response. Charge carrier transport characteristics studied by a space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method and a field effect transistor (FET) proved the existence of hole traps. Furthermore, electronic structure changes and Fermi level shifts revealed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) indicate complexation of amino groups and C70 core, which may diminish the electron-accepting capacity of fullerenes, and may potentially provide a different kind of hole trap.

Despite the disappointing photovoltaic properties as a BHJ layer, it was found that both PCDTBT-N and PC71BM-N could effectively enhance the performances of PSCs when they were used as electron-collection/-transport layers (ECLs). More interestingly, the studies on the puzzling behaviors of PCDTBT-N and PC71BM-N in different layers of PSCs offer useful information to understand the underlying working mechanisms of the widely used water–alcohol soluble ECLs, which are beyond the commonly accepted mechanism of interfacial dipole formation.
Results and discussion
Materials design, synthesis and characterization
The chemical structures of electron donor PCDTBT-N and electron acceptor PC71BM-N are presented in Scheme 1. PCDTBT-N has an identical conjugated main chain and similar branched solubilizing aliphatic side chains to the widely studied poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT),68 while PC71BM-N possesses a similar molecular geometry to that of (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butylic acid methyl ester (PC71BM) because PCDTBT:PC71BM is a very promising photovoltaic blend.69
The synthetic route for the preparation of PCDTBT-N is shown in Scheme 2a. Williamson reaction between 1,6-dibromohexane and p-cresol led to mono-bromo-functionalized compound 2 in a good yield. The Grignard reagent prepared from compound 2 then reacted with ethyl formate at low temperature to generate compound 3, which was subsequently converted to the tosylated compound 4 with 79% yield. Alkylation of 2,7-dibromo-9-H-carbazole with compound 4 was conducted to yield compound 5. The bromide-functionalized compound 6 was recovered by the deprotection reaction of compound 5 with hydrobromic acid in acetic acid (AcOH). Compound 7 was prepared by treating compound 6 with diethylamine, affording a sticky oil after column chromatography purification. The key monomer 8 was synthesized by double lithiation of compound 7 and subsequent quenching with 2-isoproxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane. The target polymer PCDTBT-N was synthesized by common Pd-catalyzed Suzuki condensation copolymerization of compound 8 and 4,7-di(2′-bromothien-5′-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (9). End-capping reaction was performed by adding phenyl boronic acid and bromobenzene successively to eliminate the potential structure defects and to enhance the stability of the resulting polymer.70 PCDTBT-N was readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as THF, chloroform, CB and DCB. More interestingly, PCDTBT-N has a good solubility (>20 mg mL−1) in alcohols (such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and n-butanol (n-BuOH)) in the presence of a trace amount of AcOH. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) experiments using chloroform as eluent and monodisperse polystyrene standards indicated that PCDTBT-N possessed a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 18 kg mol−1 and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.5.
 Scheme 2  Synthetic routes for the preparation of PCDTBT-N (a) and PC71BM-N (b). 
Scheme 2b provides the synthesis of PC71BM-N. Tosylhydrazone 10 was prepared according to the procedure reported in our previous work.63 Introduction of the C70 addend was carried out by [3 + 2] cycloaddition of compound 10 with C70 and subsequent thermal isomerization to yield compound 11. Compound 11 is a mixture of three regioisomers as confirmed by 1H-NMR, agreeing with other C70 derivatives prepared by [3 + 2] cycloaddition.63 The protecting group of p-cresoxyl in compound 11 was cleaved by BBr3 under mild conditions to afford bromo-functionalized intermediate 12. The target compound PC71BM-N was finally obtained by treating compound 12 with diethylamine in DCB. The chemical structures of C70 fullerene derivatives 11, 12 and PC71BM-N were confirmed by 1H-NMR and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS). PC71BM-N exhibited limited solubility in CB and DCB, but moderate solubility in chloroform. Moreover, PC71BM-N can be dissolved in n-BuOH with the assistance of a trace amount of AcOH.
Optical properties
Fig. 1a compares the ultraviolet-visible (UV-visible) absorption spectra of PCDTBT-N and PCDTBT in the solid state. PCDTBT-N has a similar absorption spectrum and a comparable extinction coefficient as PCDTBT, suggesting good light-harvesting ability. Both PCDTBT-N and PCDTBT exhibit two distinct absorption bands with maxima at approximately 395 and 570 nm, which are attributable to the π–π* transition of their conjugated main chains and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction between carbazole moieties and benzothiadiazole moieties, respectively. The optical band gap (Eg) of PCDTBT-N was calculated to be 1.88 eV according to the absorption onset (659 nm), which is very close to that of PCDTBT.

The solid-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of PCDTBT-N is very similar to that of PCDTBT, and exhibited an emission peak at 694 nm (see Fig. 1b and Table 1 for a summary of optical data). After adding PC71BM, the PL emission of PCDTBT-N was almost completely quenched, as in the case of PCDTBT. Moreover, PC71BM-N is an efficient PL quencher for both PCDTBT and PCDTBT-N (see Fig. 1b). These PL quenching experiments suggest ultrafast photo-induced charge transfer from the polymer to the fullerene acceptor in the presence and absence of amino groups. The amino functionalities are therefore sufficiently removed from the optically active backbone so that they have a negligible influence on the intrinsic photophysical characteristics of pristine materials and blends.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of PCDTBT-N and PC71BM-N, as well as their analogues PCDTBT and PC71BM, were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) under similar experimental conditions. The CV curves of PCDTBT and PCDTBT-N are compared in Fig. 2a. PCDTBT exhibits a well-defined oxidation process for its conjugated main chain and presents a sharp current increase at a potential around 0.87 V vs. standard calomel electrode (SCE), which is consistent with Leclerc's result.68 Interestingly, PCDTBT-N exhibits a clear oxidation process of its pendant amino groups with an onset oxidation potential around 0.5 V before the oxidation of a conjugated main chain, which was verified by the oxidation of triethylamine at the same applied potential in solution (see the inset of Fig. 2a). Like PCDTBT, PCDTBT-N showed one reversible reduction process as well, but the reduction potential of PCDTNT-N was less negative than that of PCDTBT (−0.80 vs. −0.92 V). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PCDTBT-N were calculated to be −5.37 and −3.68 eV, respectively.
 Fig. 2  (a) Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of PCDTBT and PCDTBT-N in solid states and the oxidation curve of triethylamine in solution. The inset shows the oxidation curves in the potential range from 0.4 to 1 V. (b) CV curves of PC71BM and PC71BM-N in solid states. The measurements were carried out in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 solution in acetonitrile under a nitrogen atmosphere at a scan rate of 30 mV s−1 using a SCE as the reference electrode. 
The CV curves of PC71BM and PC71BM-N are shown in Fig. 2b. In the 0 to −1.5 V range, both PC71BM-N and PC71BM display two well-defined n-doping processes. The onset potentials of each reduction process were evaluated to be −0.55 and −0.98 V for PC71BM-N, and −0.52 and −1.07 V for PC71BM, respectively. The LUMO level of PC71BM-N was estimated to be −3.93 eV, which is similar to that of PC71BM (−3.96 eV). From electrochemical considerations, one can therefore reasonably judge that PC71BM-N has good electron-accepting ability. In the 0 to 2.2 V range, PC71BM shows two well-defined p-doping processes, although only one well-defined p-doping process is observable for PC71BM-N. PC71BM-N and PC71BM exhibit the same onset oxidation potentials at 0.95 V. However, no signal for the oxidation of the amino group (around 0.5 V) is observed in the CV curve of PC71BM-N, which differs from that of PCDTBT-N. The disappearance of a signal for amino group oxidation implies that the chemical environment of the amino group on PC71BM-N is essentially different from that of the amino group on PCDTBT-N. This suggests some special amine-C70 interactions. It is worth noting reports that the lone-pair electrons on the nitrogen atom of tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene (TDAE) and acridine orange base (AOB) are prone to transfer onto fullerene, and lead to the formation of charge transfer complexes.71–73
Photovoltaic behavior
Attempts to fabricate solar cells by environmentally friendly processing were carried out by depositing the PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N blend film from n-BuOH. This solvent is economically viable and was extensively used as an artificial flavorant.74 The device structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N (1:4)/Al. Device fabrication details are provided in the ESI.† The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic of the as-cast PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N solar cell from n-BuOH solution under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination is shown in Fig. 3. Despite all reasonable expectations, the output of the PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N device is inhibited, with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) approaching zero and a very small open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.15 V. To rule out the possible negative influence caused by n-BuOH and AcOH, the reference device based on the same BHJ blend but deposited from CB:DCB (volume ratio: 1/3) was examined as well. Nevertheless, the CB:DCB processed PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N device did not exhibit any photovoltaic response as well (see Fig. 3). In contrast, the device based on the PCDTBT:PC71BM blend performed normally (Jsc = 9.63 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.81 V, FF = 50%, PCE = 3.9%). Moreover, it was reported that the PCDTBT:PC71BM cell exhibited very high charge separation and charge carrier collection efficiency, as well as a nearly 100% internal quantum efficiency.69 Since the main difference between the PCDTBT:PC71BM system and the PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N system in chemical compositions is the existence of extra amino groups in the latter, the amino groups should be responsible for the eccentric behavior of the PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N system.
 Fig. 3  J–V characteristics of PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N cells fabricated from different solvents (n-BuOH or 1:3 mixture of CB:DCB), and the PCDTBT:PC71BM cell fabricated from the 1:3 mixture of CB:DCB. The inset shows the J–V curve drawn from −1 to 2 V of the PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N cell fabricated from n-BuOH. Device configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ layer/Al. 
To convince our speculation, the photovoltaic performances of the solar cells based on the PCDTBT:PC71BM system upon the addition of amino group-containing materials (PCDTBT-N or PC71BM-N) as dopants were measured. The plots of various photovoltaic parameters (Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE) vs. dopant concentration are shown in Fig. S1.† All photovoltaic parameters were seriously reduced along with the increase of the dopant concentration. A trace amount (e.g. 0.1%) of the dopant is enough to seriously reduce the photovoltaic performance of the devices. PCEs decreased nearly to zero at a dopant concentration of 10%, either for PCDTBT-N or PC71BM-N.
It is well known that the energy conversion of a BHJ-PSC is through five key operational steps: light harvesting, exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, charge carrier transport, and charge collection. The light-harvesting process should not account for the inhibitory output of the PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N blend (see Fig. 1a and S2†). PL quenching experiments also demonstrate that diffusion and dissociation of excitons in the PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N blend proceeds readily. Hence, the inhibitory output of the PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N device is most reasonably attributable to restricted charge carrier transport.
Charge transport
The influences of amino groups on the charge carrier transport were investigated through the study of electron and hole transport behaviors of the PCDTBT:PC71BM blend upon the addition of amino group-containing materials (PCDTBT-N or PC71BM-N) as dopants using the SCLC method. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the J–V curves of electron-only devices changed only slightly upon the increase of the dopant concentrations, either for PCDTBT-N or PC71BM-N. These results indicate that amino groups do not exert a considerable influence on electron transport. In contrast, the current density of hole-only devices displayed a strong dependence on the concentrations of the dopants in both cases. The hole current density decreases considerably by adding a 0.1% amino group-containing dopant into the blend; the decrease becomes more and more substantial with increasing dopant concentration. Introduction of amino groups thus results in unbalanced carrier transport in blend films.
 Fig. 4  J–V characteristics on a double logarithmic coordinate of the electron-only devices (ITO/Al/blend layer/Ba/Al) based on PCDTBT:PC71BM upon replacing PCDTBT by PCDTBT-N (a), or replacing PC71BM by PC71BM-N (b), with different ratios, and the hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend layer/MoO3/Al) based on PCDTBT:PC71BM upon replacing PCDTBT by PCDTBT-N (c), or replacing PC71BM by PC71BM-N and (d) with different ratios. The solid lines in (c) are fit to J ∝ Vm, in which Vth denotes the transfer voltage. The mass ratio for polymer(s):fullerene(s) is 1:4. For a hole-only device, the holes were injected from the MoO3 side. 
Perhaps more importantly, doped films show trap-dependent characteristics as evidenced by the power law dependence of the hole current density on the applied bias compared to the case of the pristine PCDTBT:PC71BM blend film.75–77 At low applied bias, both pristine blend film and doped films exhibit linear dependencies between current density and applied bias, which is consistent with Ohmic conduction. Along with the increase of applied bias, the J–V characteristics of both pristine blend film and doped films exhibited a clear transfer voltage (Vth), above which logJ–logV curves inflect to a higher slope region. To express more conveniently, J ∝ Vm was used to describe the relationship between the hole current density and applied bias. For the pristine PCDTBT:PC71BM blend film, the J–V characteristic show a quadratic relationship (i.e. J ∝ V2), indicating that the hole transport behavior in this device can be regarded as trap-free space charge-limited conduction (TFSCLC).75,78,79 Briefly, such J ∝ V2 relationships suggest the absence of trap, or the existence of shallow traps, in the PCDTBT:PC71BM blend film. Hole and electron mobilities obtained by fitting the data are ∼1.4 × 10−4 and ∼2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which suggest a rough balanced carrier transport in the pristine PCDTBT:PC71BM film and agree well with the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding solar cell. Nevertheless, the addition of a trace amount of dopant led to a substantial increase in the value of exponent m in J ∝ Vm, and the exponent m increased significantly from ∼2 to ∼6.5 with the increase of dopant concentration. Generally, the increase of the exponent m is probably caused by the broadening of trap distribution in energy.76,80,81 As a result, the hole current densities are probably governed by hole traps with broad energy distribution in the amino group-containing BHJ films as well.
The occupancy of the trap level and the trapped charges plays a crucial role in the carrier transport. In SCLC devices, when V > Vth, most hole carriers are trapped, thus significantly altering the carrier and electric field distributions with respect to the trap-free case, leading to an abrupt increase of the current slope. Beyond this trap-dependent SCLC region, the slope of the current density vs. voltage in the logJ–logV plot decreased, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. In the higher bias region, the trapping sites are gradually filled and the additional injected carriers start to appear at the free-transport energy level, and hence the growth of current density upon voltage slowed down. SCLC results provide evidence of the existence of hole traps, which seriously suppressed hole transport and thereby is responsible for the absence of photocurrent. According to CV studies, the amino groups themselves are potential hole traps, due to the low oxidation potential of an amino group indicating that the lone-pair electrons on nitrogen atom of aliphatic tertiary amino group are apt to transfer to the specimens with high electron affinities (such as hole, cation, fullerene, etc.). Besides, the hole traps were probably generated through complexation of amino groups and the fullerene core, which will be discussed later.
The charge carrier transport behavior was also studied by FET tests. It is worth pointing out at first that the mobilities obtained from the transfer characteristics of FET devices are generally higher than those gained by the SCLC method due to different electric-field distribution and different carrier concentrations in the two different transporting directions.82 The hole and electron mobilities for pristine materials and their various blends in FETs are summarized in Table 2. Hole mobilities of PCDTBT and PCDTBT:PC71BM were calculated to be 2.4 × 10−3 and 2.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which were close to previously reported values.83,84 Interestingly, no hole mobility could be observed for PCDTBT-N and all amine-containing blends. These results are consistent with the SCLC measurements, and further confirm the existence of hole traps. Moreover, amino groups could adversely change the electron transport characteristics of both pristine materials and various blends. For example, the electron mobility of PCDTBT-N is one order of magnitude lower than that of PCDTBT. For polymer:fullerene blends, the electron mobility was decreased from 2.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PCDTBT:PC71BM blend to 2.4 × 10−5, 4.6 × 10−4, and 1.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PCDTBT:PC71BM-N, PCDTBT-N:PC71BM, and PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N, respectively. Notably as well, the electron mobility of pristine PC71BM-N films failed to be obtained because of their roughness. Such rough films suggest PC71BM-N aggregation during the drying process. Therefore, the electron transport along the substrate plane was blocked by the boundaries of the aggregated molecules. The same roughened films were observed in the blends composed of PC71BM-N. Hence the connectivity of the n-type percolating networks in the horizontal direction was consequentially decreased by the aggregation (please see Fig. S3 and S4† for I–V characteristics of the FETs). Based on the SCLC results and mobility measurements in the FET devices, one can tentatively conclude that amino groups may electronically act as hole traps for p-type polymers and morphologically behave as aggregation centers for n-type PC71BM, which seriously suppressed the transport of hole carriers in the BHJ layer and decreased the connectivity of the n-type channel in the horizontal direction. Therefore, electronic traps and aggregations ultimately resulted in inhibitory output.

UPS characterization
UPS characterization was carried out with monochromatized HeI radiation at 21.2 eV. Fig. 5 shows the UPS-derived valence band spectra of oxygen plasma treated bare ITO, 30 nm PC71BM on ITO, 3 nm PCDTBT-N on ITO, 3 nm PCDTBT on ITO/PC71BM (30 nm), 30 nm PC71BM:PCDTBT-N (4:1) blend on ITO, and 30 nm PC71BM:PCDTBT-N (1:1) blend on ITO at room temperature. The work functions (WFs) were defined by the secondary electron cutoff in Fig. 5a. When a PC71BM layer was deposited on an ITO substrate, the WF of ITO changed from 4.6 to 4.4 eV mainly due to the “push back effect” at the clean ITO surface.73,85 The deposition of 3 nm PCDTBT-N over PC71BM-N/ITO further decreased the WF to 4.1 eV. When the blends of PCDTBT-N:PC71BM were deposited on top of ITO, the WF was decreased to 3.9 and 3.85 eV for 1:4 and 1:1 composites, respectively. For comparison, when PCDTBT-N was directly deposited on clean ITO, the resulting WF was reduced to 4.2 eV due to the formation of an interfacial dipole.86 Clearly, the WF decrease of ITO/PC71BM/PCDTBT-N and ITO/PCDTBT-N:PC71BM is more substantial than those of ITO/PCDTBT-N and ITO/PC71BM. Notably as well, the WF changes caused by PCDTBT-N:PC71BM blends are more pronounced than those caused by the PC71BM/PCDTBT-N bilayer. These results suggested the formation of a new specimen (such as a charge transfer complex) due to the strong interaction between amino groups and PC71BM, which led to a more substantial WF decrease of ITO. Along with the increase of interfacial areas between PCDTBT-N and PC71BM and the increase of the amino group concentration, the WF decrease becomes more pronounced due to the generation of more complexes.

The UPS-derived valence band spectra in the energy gap region (see Fig. 5b) can help to disclose the origin of these shifts in WF and can be used to confirm complex formation. Two defined structures labeled A and B were observable in the spectrum of PC71BM, and a structure labeled C was observed in the spectrum of PCDTBT-N. After the deposition of a PCDTBT-N layer on top of PC71BM, peak A of PC71BM significantly weakened and peak B disappeared. When PC71BM was blended with PCDTBT-N, peak C of PCDTBT-N weakened because of the decreased concentration of PCDTBT-N in blends. Meanwhile, peaks A and B of PC71BM completely disappeared, whereas two new peaks labeled A′ and B′ at higher binding energy side emerged concurrently. Such shifts were consistent with changes of low-kinetic energy cutoff of the spectra as discussed earlier. Analogous shifts interpreted in terms of charge transfer and the shift of the Fermi level have been observed in the UPS spectra of the TDAE-C60 complex and the bilayer thin film composed of AOB and C60.72,73 TDAE and AOB are strong electron donors in which the lone-pair electrons on nitrogen atoms are prone to donate onto the specimens with high electron affinities such as fullerenes and thereby lead to the generation of complex. As a result, the origin of the observed shift in this study might also be the change of the Fermi level upon the complex formation between amino groups and PC71BM. Moreover, such complexes may be another kind of hole traps in addition to amino groups themselves.
Interface modification
As discussed above, amino groups act as hole traps in BHJ layers and thereby lead to disappointing device performance. However, amino group functionalized materials (such as PFN) often perform satisfactorily as ECLs to enhance electron collection in BHJ-PSCs.29,34,51,59 Therefore, it was of interest to probe PCDTBT-N and PC71BM-N when they were incorporated as ECLs. The study applied the device configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PC71BM/interlayer/Al, in which the active layer PCDTBT:PC71BM was deposited from the CB:DCB (1:3) mixture, while PCDBT-N and PC71BM-N were spin-coated from methanol and n-BuOH, respectively, in the presence of a trace amount of AcOH. To rule out the possible influence caused by solvents, the devices whose active layers were rinsed with methanol or n-BuOH before thermal evaporation of the Al electrode were also fabricated and tested. The J–V curves of the devices are presented in Fig. 6 and relevant device parameters are listed in Table 3.

The bare Al electrode control device exhibited a Jsc of 9.63 mA cm−2, an FF of 50%, a Voc of 0.81 V, and a PCE of 3.91%. After the incorporation of PCDTBT-N or PC71BM-N as an ECL, simultaneously enhanced Jsc, Voc and FF were observed. For the PCDTBT-N modified device, the Jsc, Voc, and FF of the solar cell were increased to 10.15 mA cm−2, 0.92 V, and 57% respectively, contributing to an enhanced PCE of 5.32%. When PC71BM-N was used as an ECL, the Jsc, Voc, and FF of the device were increased to 10.22 mA cm−2, 0.85 V and 56% respectively, which thereby led to a higher PCE of 4.86%. Moreover, it is clear that solvent effects are less pronounced than those of PCDTBT-N and PC71BM-N. Briefly, PCDTBT-N and PC71BM-N worked well as ECLs in BHJ-PSCs. As a result, an interesting phenomenon emerged: hole traps (caused by amino groups) in the BHJ layer seriously depressed hole transport and photovoltaic output, but such traps in ECL benefit device performance.
Numerical simulations were carried out to disclose the mechanisms responsible for the puzzling behavior of PCDTBT-N and PC71BM-N in different device layers. For simplicity, a classical one dimensional metal–insulator–metal model was used to calculate the J–V of photovoltaic devices.87,88 The commonly used field-dependent photocurrent models such as a field-dependent exciton dissociation model89 or a charge density dependent recombination model90,91 were not used in the calculation to emphasize the single effect of hole traps. The model contains drift and diffusion of both electrons and holes, and uses the Poisson equation to calculate electric field spatial distribution inside the device.92 Hole traps were set to only influence the electric field distribution through a space charge effect, and it has no effect on electron or hole mobilities to exclude the more complicated effects of charge trapping. The resulting basic equations describing the charge transport are solved self-consistently. Bimolecular recombination is included in the simulation93 with no other types of recombination present in the device. Detailed parameters used in the simulations are listed in Table S1.†
Three devices with different configurations were used in the numerical calculation for comparison: Device I is a device without any hole traps inside the active layer to simulate the reference photovoltaic device without electron selective layer or active layer doping; Device II is a device with a hole trap density of 5 × 1024 m−3 concentrated at 5 nm adjacent to the electron collecting electrode to simulate the photovoltaic device using PCDTBT-N or PC71BM-N as an ECL; Device III is a device with a hole trap density of 1 × 1023 m−3 evenly distributed inside the active layer to simulate the photovoltaic device with PCDTBT-N or PC71BM-N in the BHJ layer. It should be pointed out that hole concentration values are not experimentally determined, but rather chosen to be high enough for the effects to be significantly expressed in the J–V data. (More simulated J–V data of devices with different hole trap densities are presented in Fig. S5.†) The simulated J–V characteristics of these three devices are shown in Fig. 7a. It can be seen that uniform distribution of hole traps inside the active layer is detrimental to photovoltaic device performance, as the FF, Jsc and Voc of Device III were all decreased compared to Device I. However, if hole traps can be confined to the vicinity of an electron collecting electrode, they will improve the overall device performance by slightly increasing the Voc. The simulation result in Fig. 7a qualitatively agrees with experimental data that PCDTBT-N or PC71BM-N doped in the BHJ layer reduces device performance, while using PCDTBT-N or PC71BM-N as an ECL conversely improves device performance. The fact that interfacial hole traps near the metal electrode can enhance performances of PSCs was also reported by Zhang et al.94
 Fig. 7  (a) Simulated J–V characteristics of three solar cell devices with different hole trap density distribution inside the active layer. Device I: device without a hole trap; Device II: device with a hole trap density of 5 × 1024 m−3 concentrated at 5 nm adjacent to the metal electrode (electron collecting electrode); Device III: device with a hole trap density of 1 × 1023 m−3 evenly distributed inside the active layer. (b) Simulated electric field distribution inside the active layer of three devices at 0.7 V external bias. 
The drastically different effects on device performance caused by different hole trap density distribution profiles can be explained by looking into the electric field distribution in the active layer of different devices, as shown in Fig. 7b. The external bias was selected to be 0.7 V, which was close to the maximum power point for the three devices. It can be seen that Device II had a higher electric field than the reference Device I, especially near the electron-collecting electrode. On the other hand the electric field of Device III was significantly lower than that of Device I in most regions of the active layer, especially at the center where the electric field was nearly screened completely. Consequently, the transport of photo-generated electron–hole pairs in Device II would be enhanced by the stronger electric field, while it would be severely hampered in Device III. Similar results can be observed when applying different external bias to the three devices.
As discussed above, UPS spectra and CV studies have confirmed the formation of the amine:C70 complex. In other word, C70 could be n-doped by an amino group through the electron transfer from the nitrogen atom to the C70 core. It is hence reasonable to speculate that the n-doping of PC71BM at the interface of the BHJ layer and ECL by an amino group may also be an important factor that contributes to the device performance enhancements in that doped films can simultaneously reduce transport loss and facilitate Ohmic contact at the interface of the BHJ layer/electron collecting electrode.95,96 Besides, there is an extra self-doping process in the PC71BM-N ECL. The n-doping of fullerene by an electron-rich specimen has also been observed by Jen's group recently.97,98
Clearly, our results bring new insights into the underlying working mechanisms of water–alcohol processed ECLs. Previously, the interface modification functions of water–alcohol soluble ECLs were commonly interpreted as the formation of an interfacial dipole both in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs)86,99–101 and PSCs.29,34,102 However, it is obvious that the directions of interface dipoles in PLEDs and PSCs should be opposite in order to facilitate the electron injection from the cathode to the emission layer or improve the electron extraction from the active layer to the electron collecting electrode, respectively. Thus, it is difficult to understand why these water–alcohol soluble interlayer materials worked very well both in PLEDs38,57,86,99,100,103–107 and PSCs29,32,34,38,56,57 according to such interfacial dipole explanation. Our studies demonstrate that the accumulation of hole traps near the metal electrode and the interfacial n-doping of PC71BM are also important causes for the good interfacial functions of amino group-containing surfactants in addition to the commonly observed work function reduction of the electron-collecting electrode.34,102
Conclusions
In conclusion, an alcohol soluble narrow-band-gap conjugated polymer PCDTBT-N and a new alcohol soluble C70 fullerene derivative PC71BM-N, which were functionalized with a tertiary amino group were designed and synthesized for the fabrication of high performance BHJ-PSCs via environmentally friendly processing. Despite the positive expectations, the device using PCDTBT-N:PC71BM-N as a BHJ layer did not present any photovoltaic output regardless of the processing conditions. Electrochemical studies and charge transport characteristics studied by SCLC and FET revealed that the amino groups among these materials act as hole traps and disable the hole transport ability of the corresponding BHJ layer. Furthermore, UPS characterizations indicated electronic structure changes and Fermi level shifts upon complexation of amino groups and the C70 core, which may cripple the electron-accepting capability of the fullerene, and provide a different kind of trap. These discoveries and studies demonstrate the complexity of developing high performance environmentally friendly solvent processable photovoltaic materials, which are far beyond simply attaching highly polar groups onto classical conjugated backbones. Plenty of other polar groups rather than amino groups are required to be examined, and new concepts also need to be developed.
Interestingly, despite disappointing photovoltaic properties as a BHJ layer, both PCDTBT-N and PC71BM-N performed well as ECLs to enhance electron collection in PSCs. The studies on the puzzling behaviors of PCDTBT-N and PC71BM-N in different layers of PSCs provide new insights into the underlying working mechanisms of the extensively used water–alcohol soluble ECLs. Numerical simulations disclosed that hole traps distributed in the BHJ layer reduce device performance, while hole traps concentrated near the metal electrode can conversely enhance device performance. Moreover, the formation of an amine:C70 complex may be another important cause of the performance improvements of the solar cells using PCDTBT-N and PC71BM-N as ECLs, due to the formation of Ohmic contact and reduced transport loss for efficient electron collection through the n-doping of PC71BM at the interface of the BHJ layer and ECL. In other words, our studies showed that the accumulation of hole traps near the metal electrode and the n-doping of PC71BM at the interface of the BHJ layer and ECL significantly contributed to the good interfacial functions of the extensively used amino groups-containing surfactants in addition to the commonly observed work function reduction due to the interfacial dipole.

Broader context
The bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cell (PSC) is a promising renewable energy source due to its advantages of low-cost, lightweight, and mechanical flexibility and its potential of developing into large area modules by solution processing. Significant improvements in efficiencies of PSCs have been achieved, but the film forming process for high efficiency PSCs almost exclusively involved with toxic organic solvents. Toward “green solvent” processed PSCs, an alcohol soluble photovoltaic polymer and an alcohol soluble C70 fullerene derivative, which were functionalized with amino group(s) were developed. Despite the positive expectation, photovoltaic studies showed that the solar cells based on this amine-containing conjugated polymer/fullerene blend did not exhibit any photovoltaic response. In-depth studies disclosed the hole trap nature of amine itself and the complexation of amine and the fullerene core. Further investigations revealed that the accumulation of such hole traps and the complexation of amine:fullerene at the metal/semiconductor interface are important causes of the excellent modification properties of the widely used water–alcohol soluble interfacial materials. This contribution not only sheds light on the essentials of developing “green solvent” processable photovoltaic materials, but also provides new insights into the underlying working mechanisms of the widely used water–alcohol soluble interfacial materials.
