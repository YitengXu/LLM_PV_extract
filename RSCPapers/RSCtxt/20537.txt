In this work, we demonstrate that such a challenge also exists in the state-of-the-art Y-series non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) based active layers such as PM6:Y6, PM6:L8-BO, and PM6:BTP-eC9. Moisture condensation during processing in high RH air should be the crucial factor that deteriorates the BHJ morphology. It was found that polymers PQSi705 and PTQ10, both comprising a quinoxaline–thiophene conjugated skeleton but with/without the 5% siloxane-terminated side chain, respectively, showed quite different humidity tolerance when casting the active layer. The PTQ10:Y6 active layer processed in a N2 glovebox, air with 65% RH, and air with 93% RH exhibited PCEs of 14.82%, 13.43%, and 12.22%, respectively, whereas the resulting PQSi705:Y6 active layers displayed almost identical PCEs of ∼16.1%, suggesting that PQSi705 with a siloxane-terminated side chain decoration afforded high humidity endurance in air-processing. The robustness of the PQSi705:Y6 active layer against moisture or water was also supported by investigations such as long-term storage (306 days) of OSCs in air, water immersion on the active layer surface, and exposing the active layer to boiling water vapor, all showing superior PCE retention. With m-TEH as the NFA, the PQSi705:m-TEH active layers processed in the N2 glovebox and 90% RH air exhibited almost identical PCEs of ∼18%. This is the highest efficiency so far reported for BHJ active layers fabricated in high RH air. Moreover, strong humidity tolerance in the air-processing was also achieved by more polymer donors or non-fullerene acceptors with siloxane-terminated side chains, suggesting certain universality. This work indicates that attaching a siloxane-terminated side chain on photoactive materials is a valuable chemical countermeasure to allow air-processing and withstand large variations in humidity.

Broader context
Although the majority of organic solar cells (OSCs) are fabricated in an inert atmosphere, for example, in a N2 glovebox, high performance OSCs processed under ambient conditions should be the final goal because of advantages such as convenient manufacturing, lower equipment investment, and higher compatibility with the large-area module. Different from an inert atmosphere, ambient conditions involve oxygen and water, and the water content or relative humidity (RH) in air can be largely varied in different seasons. In rainy seasons and certain areas, more than 90% RH is possible. Herein, we demonstrate that in air with high RH, evaporation of the solvent during bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) film-formation could result in moisture condensation on the surface, and suppressing moisture condensation induced BHJ morphology damage has become a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Furthermore, we report that attaching a siloxane-terminated side chain on a photoactive material is a valuable strategy to realize high humidity tolerance of a BHJ active layer, which is helpful in keeping the morphology and device performance unchanged. This discovery highlights a new function of the siloxane-terminated side chain, which will pave the way for upgrading photoactive materials towards high performing air-processability for OSCs.

Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their unique advantages of cost effectiveness, flexibility, semitransparency, and easy fabrication through large area roll-to-roll or printing technologies.1–6 Over the past few decades, enormous efforts have been devoted to promoting the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs, including exploration of photoactive materials,7–9 manipulation of active layer morphology10–13 and innovation of device structures.14–17 To date, the certified record PCEs of non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) based OSCs have outperformed the predicted commercial efficiency threshold of 15%.18,19 In this context, the commercial demands on the cost effectiveness and stability should be the important concerns.20,21 Although the majority of OSCs are fabricated in an inert atmosphere, for example, in a N2 glovebox, especially for the state-of-the-art OSCs, high performance OSCs processed under ambient conditions should be the final goal because of advantages such as convenient manufacturing, lower equipment investment, and higher compatibility with a large-area module. So far, printed OSCs via slot-die,22,23 doctor blade,24,25 and spreading26 techniques have been conducted in air. Different from an inert atmosphere, ambient conditions involve oxygen and water, and the water content or relative humidity (RH) in air can be largely varied in different seasons. In the rainy season and certain areas, more than 90% RH is possible. Ideal bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layer materials for OSCs should combine high efficiency, high stability, and strong humidity endurance in air-processing.
Even in the era of fullerene based BHJ active layers, ambient processed OSCs had been prepared. However, many reports involving air-processing of OSCs do not provide the RH value of the air, and this would affect the evaluation of photovoltaic performances of the active layer materials (entries 1–10, Table S1, ESI†). Controlled air conditions with RH below 45% are usually applied in the air-processing of OSCs (entries 11–16, Table S1, ESI†).27,28 In a RH range between 35% and 45%, some comparisons indicated that obviously changed BHJ morphologies could be observed for fullerene and NFA based active layers when fabricated under ambient and inert conditions, leading to more than 20% efficiency drops for air-processing.28 In fact, an air environment with higher RH would result in more severe damage to the BHJ morphology. In a report by Yuan et al., continuously decreased PCEs along with increasing RH were found for fullerene based active layers.29 Two all-polymer active layers PTB7-Th:PDI-V30 and PBDB-T:N220029 were rare examples of minimizing the morphological changes, whose OSCs cast in high RH of 80% or 90% showed almost identical PCEs if compared with those obtained with N2-processing or air-processing under zero RH (entries 18 and 19, Table S1, ESI†). Generally, the two all-polymer active layers can show strong humidity endurance during the film-forming process, and the remaining challenge lies in the not so high PCEs (≤7.3%).
In the past several years, Y6 and its derivatives as powerful NFAs continuously boosted the PCEs of OSCs to a high level of over 18%.31–33 Unfortunately, obviously decreased PCEs were found for several notable Y-series NFA based active layers when fabricated in air with high RH (Table S2, ESI†). A comprehensive understanding of the mechanism for the damage of the BHJ morphology is very important. Herein, we propose that moisture condensation during casting the active layer in air with high RH should be the crucial factor that deteriorates the morphology, and we further propose a relevant materials countermeasure through revealing the big difference of humidity tolerance when processing active layers of polymers PTQ10 and PQSi705 (Fig. 1(a)) in air. The two polymer donors possess the same quinoxaline–thiophene conjugated skeleton34 but slightly different side chains. The simple quinoxaline–thiophene skeleton has been regarded as having huge potential for the preparation of low-cost polymer donor PTQ10.35 The side-chain random copolymer PQSi705 comprises a minor decoration with a 5% siloxane-terminated side chain.36 The PTQ10:Y6 active layer processed in a N2 glovebox afforded a PCE of 14.82% but a much lower efficiency of 12.22% was found for processing in 93% RH air. To our delight, OSCs with PQSi705:Y6 active layers fabricated in the N2 glovebox and 93% RH air showed almost identical PCEs of ∼16.1%, suggesting that PQSi705 with siloxane-terminated side chain decoration afforded humidity endurance in air-processing. It is proposed that the hydrophobic nature of siloxane terminated side chains of polymer PQSi705 may weaken the moisture condensation on the blend film surface even under high humidity conditions and suppress the entry of water droplets in the blend film, finally restraining water induced morphology damage to the blend film (Fig. 1(b)). Moreover, strong humidity tolerance in the air-processing could be confirmed with more active layer materials including other polymer donors or NFA with siloxane-terminated side chains, suggesting some universality of structural design. Particularly, with m-TEH as the NFA, the PQSi705:m-TEH active layers processed in the N2 glovebox and 90% RH air exhibited almost identical PCEs of ∼18%. This is the highest efficiency so far reported for BHJ active layers fabricated in high RH air. In a very recent report, silicon oxide barrier layers could enhance moisture tolerance of perovskite solar cells.37 Siloxanes and silicon oxide, in some sense, have similar chemical species and appear to share this moisture tolerance property.

Usually, along with solvent evaporation, the moisture in air condenses onto the substrate surface to form water droplets. We propose that the hydrophobic nature of siloxane-terminated side chains of polymer PQSi705 may weaken the moisture condensation on the blend film surface even under high humidity conditions and suppress the entry of water droplets in the blend film, finally restraining water induced morphology damage to the blend film. 
Results and discussion
In the past several years, polymer PM6 as the donor in combination with Y-series NFAs greatly contributed to the development of high-efficiency OSCs. However, the majority of state-of-the-art OSCs are fabricated under an inert atmosphere, for example, in a N2 glovebox. Here, we compared the impact of changing the fabrication environment from N2 glovebox to air with 90% RH on the efficiency of OSCs, based on some high-efficiency systems PM6:Y6, PM6:L8-BO, and PM6:BTP-eC9 (Table S2, ESI†). The PM6:Y6 and PM6:L8-BO active layers processed in a N2 glovebox showed PCEs of 15.85% and 18.04%, respectively. Fabrications of the two active layers in air with 90% RH only afforded OSCs with PCEs of 13.98% and 16.18%, respectively, showing a significant decrease in the efficiency. The PM6:BTP-eC9 active layer was an extreme case. Its processing in the N2 glovebox could afford a device with 17.54% efficiency, however, when processing in air with 90% RH it was difficult to achieve qualified OSCs, leading to an abnormal J–V curve and zero efficiency (Table S2 and Fig. S1a, ESI†). The processing of the PM6:BTP-eC9 active layer in air with 90% RH should result in completely deteriorated morphology compared with that in the N2 glovebox, even observed with the naked eye (Fig. S1b, ESI†). To enhance the visual effect, we fabricated thinner active layer films (∼50 nm) under the two processing conditions (Fig. 2(a)). Relative to the smooth film cast in the N2 glovebox, the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend film processed in air with 90% RH became quite nonuniform, indicating that processing in a high humidity air would greatly damage the BHJ morphology of the BTP-eC9 based active layer.

(b) Moisture condensation on the substrate after evaporation of pure chloroform (left) and FC-S1 chloroform solution (right) in air with 38% and 90% relative humidity. 
The morphology damage of a BHJ active layer during its casting in high humidity air should be related to the condensation of moisture. Usually, the concentration of the photoactive material solution is about 1%. The evaporation of such a large amount of solvent during the film forming process will reduce the substrate temperature due to the evaporation enthalpy of the solvent. This will result in moisture condensation on the substrate. To analyse the different moisture condensations on the substrate in different RH air, we carried out relevant experiments. Chloroform with a low boiling point of 61.2 °C and a large density of 1.48 g cm−3 is a common solvent for many photoactive materials. First, we compared chloroform evaporations under air conditions with 38% and 90% RH (see the ESI,† Videos V1 and V2 on the web page). At a low RH of 38%, there was almost no moisture condensation on the substrate after chloroform evaporation (Fig. 2(b)). However, in air with a high RH of 90%, the evaporation process of chloroform included (1) the formation of a lot of small water droplets on the liquid surface due to the lower density of water, (2) the formation of floating thin water films, and (3) the final formation of large water droplets on the substrate. Next, we traced the evaporation processes of polymer solutions under the 38% and 90% RH conditions (see the ESI,† Videos V3 and V4 on the web page). The polymer solution is used to achieve a better visual effect. Typical photoactive layers normally possess large absorption coefficients in the visible range even at a thickness of ∼100 nm, and it is difficult to view the moisture condensation on the surface. For this, a light-yellow polymer FC-S1 (see the chemical structure in Fig. S2, ESI†) was employed to prepare the chloroform solution.38 In air with 90% high humidity, similar moisture condensation and formation of thin water film on the liquid surface could be observed. The film forming at 90% RH resulted in a very rough FC-S1 film compared with that fabricated under a low RH of 38% (Fig. 2(b)). Another feature of the FC-S1 film formation at 90% RH is that water droplets are hardly found on the final polymer surface, whereas the evaporation of pure chloroform at 90% RH eventually leads to a lot of water droplets on the substrate. This behavior suggests that small water droplets formed during the evaporation of the polymer solution will be absorbed inside the polymer film via the capillary effect. This is confirmed by the Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) spectrum of the FC-S1 film cast in air with 90% RH (Fig. S3, ESI†). Furthermore, images for moisture condensations on the substrate after evaporations of pure chloroform and FC-S1 chloroform solution in air within the RH range from 50% to 90% are shown in Fig. S4, ESI.† At a low RH of 50%, only a small number of water droplets are left on the substrate after evaporation of pure chloroform, and the fabricated FC-S1 film with its chloroform solution also shows a fairly smooth surface. Along with the increase of RH, the number and size of water droplets present on the substrate will gradually increase upon evaporation of pure chloroform. For the fabrication of the FC-S1 film, air with a higher RH will result in a more deteriorated morphology of the polymer film, probably due to the higher content of moisture condensation on the surface. The results indicate that moisture condensation should be the important factor that affects the morphology of an active layer, especially for casting of a solution in a high RH air.
To overcome the impact of moisture condensation on the active layer morphology during processing in air, there are two possible ways. One is casting an active layer in air with a low enough RH, e.g. in air with RH lower than 35% in some reports.27 However, this would lead to much higher investment in the production line and routine energy consumption. Another more ideal way is the direct selection of high performing active layer materials with strong humidity tolerance in air-processing.
Introducing siloxane-terminated side chains to partially replace traditional alkyl side chains in polymer donors,36,39–44 polymer acceptors,45 small molecular donors,46 and NFAs47,48 has been developed by our research group so as to improve OSC efficiency, where enhancement of the face-on orientation,39,40,46,49 improvement of carrier mobility,49,50 and tuning of miscibility between a polymer donor and an NFA12,41–43,47 have been observed. In this work, a new function of high humidity tolerance for air-processed active layer was discovered with PQSi705 compared to PTQ10. Polymer PQSi705, comprising a minor decoration with 5% siloxane-terminated side chain, has the same quinoxaline–thiophene conjugated backbone as PTQ10 (Fig. 1(a)). Polymers PTQ10 and PQSi705 were synthesized in our lab according to previous reports,35,36 with almost identical molecular weights (Mn) of 21.9 and 20.2 kg mol−1 as well as comparable poly-dispersity indices (PDI) of 2.68 and 2.24, respectively. Relative to PTQ10, polymer PQSi705 with minor siloxane-terminated side chain decoration shows enhanced absorption at 615 nm (Fig. S5a, ESI†) and slightly up-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels, giving larger off-sets of the energy levels with NFA Y6 (Fig. S5b, ESI†). The photovoltaic devices were fabricated with an inverted structure consisting of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al, with detailed procedures described in the ESI.† The PTQ10:Y6 and PQSi705:Y6 active layers were fabricated in the N2 glovebox (water and oxygen content <0.1%) or ambient environment with controlled humidity (RH: 65% and 93%). The D:A mass ratios for the PTQ10:Y6 and PQSi705:Y6 active layers are 1:1.2, cast with chloroform solutions (total concentration 17 mg mL−1). Spin-coating of an active layer was conducted at 3000 rpm for 40 s, giving a film thickness of ∼110 nm. Their current–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). The detailed parameters including open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) are summarized in Table 1.

The PTQ10:Y6 based devices processed in a N2-filled glovebox (RH ≈ 0%) exhibited a PCE of 14.82%, based on a Voc of 0.857 V, a Jsc of 25.37 mA cm−2, and a FF of 67.85%. Processing of the PTQ10:Y6 active layer in air led to decreased efficiency. In air with a moderate RH of 65%, it was found that all three photovoltaic parameters of the resulting OSCs were reduced, giving a PCE of 13.43%. A further deteriorated PCE of 12.22% was achieved for the processing of the active layer in air with a high RH of 93%, according to a weakened Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 23.64 mA cm−2, and a FF of 61.45%. For the PQSi705:Y6 based active layer, the OSCs processed under N2 conditions afforded a Voc of 0.841 V, a Jsc of 26.78 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.64%, showing a PCE of 16.14%. To our delight, processing under ambient conditions almost did not deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of the devices, even under high RH conditions. The OSCs fabricated in air with 65% and 93% RH could display PCEs of 16.16% and 16.08%, respectively, based on identical Voc values and faint variations of Jsc and FF values.
The standard deviations in the efficiency of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 3(c). The fabrications of the PTQ10:Y6 and PQSi705:Y6 active layers under N2 conditions exhibited small PCE deviations. However, air processing of the PTQ10:Y6 active layer would increase the standard deviation. In air with 93% RH, OSCs showed a large standard deviation according to averaged PCE of 11.12 ± 1.09% (Table 1). Relative to PTQ10:Y6, air processing of the PQSi705:Y6 active layer still retains a small PCE deviation, indicating much better device reproducibility when casting the PQSi705:Y6 active layer under air conditions with largely variable RH.
Fig. 3(d) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves and the corresponding integrated Jsc values of the OSCs fabricated in the N2 glovebox and air with a high RH of 93%. The fabrications of the PQSi705:Y6 based devices under the two conditions showed very little changes in the spectral responses, giving integrated Jsc values of 25.30 and 25.63 mA cm−2, respectively. The two processing conditions could affect the spectral responses of the PTQ10:Y6 based devices, and fabrication in air exhibited an obviously lower maximum EQE (EQEmax) of 78.03% at 570 nm and an integrated Jsc of 22.39 mA cm−2 compared with an EQEmax of 80.95% and an integrated Jsc of 24.04 mA cm−2 for N2 processing. All the integrated Jsc values calculated from the EQE curves are consistent with those achieved from the J–V measurements (within 5% mismatch).
According to methods of previous reports,36 exciton dissociation (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) of the PTQ10:Y6 and PQSi705:Y6 based OSCs were analyzed (Fig. S6a and b, ESI†). The ηdiss for PTQ10:Y6 and PQSi705:Y6 based OSCs processed in the N2 glovebox are 95.56% and 97.01% respectively, and similar values of 94.46% and 97.65% are obtained for the corresponding OSCs processed in air with 93% RH (Table S3, ESI†), indicating that the processing conditions have less impact on the ηdiss values of these two systems. The ηcoll values of PTQ10:Y6-based devices are seriously affected by the processing conditions. The PTQ10:Y6 based device fabricated in air with 93% RH showed a distinctly decreased ηcoll (67.49%) compared with that cast in the N2 glovebox (81.66%). Relative to PTQ10:Y6, PQSi705:Y6 has less reduction in ηcoll value in high humidity air processing (85.91%) compared with that in N2 processing (87.29%).
The dependencies of Voc and Jsc at various light intensities (Plight) can offer some information about the recombination process of the OSCs. In OSCs, the slope of the Voc versus light intensity is expected to be equal to kT/q,51 which means negligible trap recombination in the device. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the PTQ10:Y6 device in air with 93% RH showed a significantly increased slope (1.98 kT/q) compared with that cast in the N2 glovebox (1.15 kT/q), indicating that PTQ10:Y6 based devices suffer from quite severe trap recombination when processed in high humidity air. Relative to PTQ10:Y6 devices, the PQSi705-based devices exhibit negligible changes in the slope (∼1.15 kT/q). The relationship between Jsc and Plight can be expressed as Jsc ∝ Pαlight.52 The PTQ10:Y6 and PQSi705:Y6 based devices yield a similar α value close to 0.93 when processed in the N2 glovebox or air conditions with 93% RH (Fig. S6c and d, ESI†), indicating that bimolecular recombination was limited.
 Fig. 4  (a) The dependency of VOC on light intensity and (b) SCLC hole and electron mobilities for the PTQ10 and PQSi705 based active layers processed in the N2 glovebox and air with 93% RH. 
The carrier transport properties are intimately related to the FF in the OSC device. Here, the hole-only and electron-only mobilities were measured by space-charge-limited current (SCLC).53 As shown in Fig. 4(b), the PTQ10:Y6 based device fabricated in air with 93% RH shows distinctly increased hole mobility and decreased electron mobility compared with those processed in the N2 glovebox, leading to increased unbalance for carrier transport. The result is consistent with the lower FF values of PTQ10:Y6 based devices prepared in high humidity air. Relative to the PTQ10:Y6 blends, the PQSi705:Y6 blends retain almost unchanged hole mobility and electron mobility when processed under the two conditions. All of the above results demonstrate that the carrier transport of the PQSi705:Y6 blend film is not sensitive to the processing conditions, which contributes to the device repeatability of PQSi705:Y6 in high humidity air processing.
The Raman spectra of PQSi705, PTQ10, and Y6 neat films processed in air with 93% humidity and N2 glovebox were compared so as to find whether oxidation would take place during air-processing of the materials. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the shape and peak position of the Raman spectra of the PQSi705, PTQ10, and Y6 films prepared in N2 and air (RH 93%) showed almost the same features, suggesting that the short period of air-processing did not alter the chemical structures of these photoactive materials. Therefore, performance degradation of PTQ10:Y6 under high humidity conditions may be related to moisture condensation induced deterioration of the blend morphology. In order to understand the impact of moisture on the blend morphology, we further carried out atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements. Fig. 5 shows the AFM height images and TEM images of the PTQ10:Y6 and PQSi705:Y6 blend films prepared in the N2 glovebox and air with 93% RH. For the AFM images, changing the processing conditions from N2 glovebox to air with 93% RH resulted in a rougher surface of the PTQ10:Y6 blend (Fig. S5a and b, ESI†), as indicated by an increase of the surface roughness (Rq) from 0.84 to 0.97 nm. But the PQSi705:Y6 blend films prepared in the N2 glovebox and air with 93% RH displayed comparable Rq values of ∼1.03 nm (Fig. S5c and d, ESI†), resulting in negligible changes of the surface morphology. The TEM images for the PTQ10:Y6 blends shown in Fig. 5(e) and (f) confirmed that a morphology difference existed when changing the processing conditions from the N2 glovebox to air with 93% RH whereas the two fabrication conditions resulted in a very small effect on the TEM morphologies of the PQSi705:Y6 blend films (Fig. S5 and h, ESI†). The results suggest that relative to PTQ10, polymer PQSi705 comprising the siloxane-terminated side chain is beneficial for suppressing moisture condensation induced deterioration of the blend morphology.

Siloxane is a hydrophobic group, which can strongly affect the surface energy of materials.36,43 Siloxane based additives have been incorporated into paint materials to protect ancient architectural wood from water destruction.54,55 To understand the role of the minor siloxane-terminated side chain in the PQSi705:Y6 blend film, we further performed the contact-angle test generated from water and oil droplets on the surfaces of polymer neat films and their blend films, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The contact angles and the calculated surface energy values are listed in Table S4 (ESI†). For the water contact angles (θwater), 94.8° and 93.2° were found for the PTQ10 neat film and the PTQ10:Y6 blend film, respectively. Higher θwater values of 97.1° and 96.9° were achieved for the PQSi705 neat film and PQSi705:Y6 blend film, respectively, which could also contribute to lower surface energies for the two films if compared with PTQ10. The results demonstrate that the minor siloxane-terminated side chain can obviously enhance the hydrophobicity of the resulting materials. On casting a blend solution in high RH air, the solvent evaporation would result in water condensation on the substrate, which should be an important factor affecting the blend morphology. For this, we propose that the hydrophobic nature of the siloxane-terminated side chain of polymer PQSi705 may weaken the moisture condensation on the blend film surface even under high humidity conditions and suppress the water droplets entry in the blend film, finally restraining the water induced morphology damage to the blend film (Fig. 1(b)).
The strong humidity endurance of the PQSi705:Y6 active layer aroused our curiosity about its robustness under two extremely harsh conditions involving water. For the first one, the active layer was fabricated in air and then its surface was immersed in water for 10 min (Fig. 6(a)), with the resulting OSC performance depicted in Fig. 6(b). For the second extremely harsh treatment, the PQSi705:Y6 active layer was exposed to boiling water vapor for 10 min (Fig. 6(c)), with device performance given in Fig. 6(d). All the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The two extremely harsh conditions involving water exhibited a negligible effect on device performances. For water immersion, the device showed a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 26.63 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.20%, giving a PCE of 15.95%, while for the device exposed to boiling water vapor, a comparable PCE of 16.01% was achieved, based on a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 26.81 mA cm−2, and a FF of 70.97%. As a comparison, the PTQ10:Y6 active layers were also treated under the two extremely harsh conditions (Table S5, ESI†). The much lower and great variations of the device performances indicate that the PTQ10:Y6 active layers are vulnerable under the two harsh conditions.

The storage of an OSC under ambient conditions needs to overcome the moisture damage to the morphology of the active layer. Here, we compare the long-term stability of PTQ10:Y6 and PQSi705:Y6 based OSCs (Fig. 7). To achieve OSCs with efficiency high enough for comparison, all the OSCs were fabricated in the N2 glovebox. Storage was carried out in air with a moderate RH of 60–70%, a general circumstance. In order to weaken the water vapor damage to the aluminum electrode during the long-term observation, the OSCs were simply encapsulated within epoxy resin.56 First, the shelf-life stability of the OSCs was determined in a N2 glovebox, which was an evaluation of intrinsic morphology stability of the active layer in the absence of moisture. After 60 days, the PTQ10:Y6 and PQSi705:Y6 based devices retained 79% and 93% of their initial PCEs, respectively. For longer storages of 100 and 306 days, the PQSi705:Y6 based OSCs could retain 87% and 86% of the initial efficiency, respectively. The result suggests that the PQSi705:Y6 active layer in the device tends to form a stable morphology in the moisture-free circumstance. The BHJ blend film composed of a polymer donor and a non-fullerene acceptor in a freshly prepared OSC device normally corresponds to a meta-stable morphology.57 During long-term storage, the morphology of the blend film will show some changes and tend to a stable morphology. Based on the quite different storage stability of the PTQ10 and PQSi705 based OSCs under N2 conditions, it can be concluded that the poor storage stability of PTQ10:Y6 based OSCs suggests that its meta-stable blend morphology is far away from a stable state. For the PQSi705 based OSCs, its notable 86% retention of the initial efficiency after 306 days indicates that the initial meta-stable state of the PQSi705:Y6 blend film would be very close to a stable one. In the cases of device storage in air, the PTQ10:Y6 based OSCs only retained 50% of its initial PCE after 60 days, showing a much more significant deterioration of the efficiency compared with storage in N2. However, the PQSi705:Y6 based OSCs kept in air for 60, 100, and 306 days could retain 93%, 84%, and 83% of the initial efficiency, respectively, leading to a comparable PCE retention as in N2. Therefore, the PQSi705:Y6 based devices are not sensitive to the long-term storage in air, demonstrating a fairly stable BHJ morphology of the PQSi705:Y6 active layer and its great potential for future commercial application.

Next, we investigated the high humidity tolerance of PQSi705 in combination with another powerful NFA m-TEH (Fig. 8(a)). The PQSi705:m-TEH based devices processed in a N2 glovebox exhibited a much higher PCE of 18.02%, based on a Voc of 0.882 V, a Jsc of 27.10 mA cm−2, and a FF of 75.14% (Fig. 8(b) and Table S6, ESI†). On changing the processing environment of the active layer from N2 to air with 90% RH, the PQSi705:m-TEH based devices could also achieve comparable parameters, leading to an almost identical PCE of 18.00%. This is the highest efficiency so far reported for an active layer processed in high humidity air. The integrated Jsc values of the two OSCs, calculated from the EQE curves, are consistent with those achieved from the J–V measurements, within 5% mismatch (Fig. 8(c)). The high humidity processability of PQSi705 in combination with different acceptors demonstrates the powerful function of PQSi705 containing siloxane terminated side chains in resisting moisture, supplying potential photoactive materials towards high performing air-processability for OSCs.

Furthermore, to verify the universality of the siloxane-terminated side chain induced humidity tolerance, we investigated more photoactive materials including other polymer donors or NFA with siloxane-terminated side chains. In the past few years, polymer donors PBZ-2Si and Si25, as well as NFA i-IESi-4F, comprising siloxane-terminated side chains, were reported by our group (Fig. S9, ESI†).39,40,47 Here, three types of donor–acceptor systems were designed (Table S6, ESI†). BHJ blends of PBZ-2Si:i-IEICO-4F and Si25:Y6-BO belong to a system based on a polymer donor comprising the siloxane-terminated side chain to pair with a routine NFA while the J52:i-IESi-4F system is constructed with a routine polymer donor and an NFA comprising the siloxane-terminated side chain. The PBZ-2Si:i-IESi-4F active layer belongs to a system in which a polymer donor and an NFA both comprise siloxane-terminated side chains. PBZ-2Si:i-IEICO-4F, Si25:Y6-BO, J52:i-IESi-4F, and PBZ-2Si:i-IESi-4F active layers fabricated under N2 glovebox conditions displayed PCEs of 13.02%, 12.03%, 11.60%, and 14.11% in OSCs, respectively. Changing the fabrication conditions from N2 to air with 90% RH, the resulting OSCs could show comparable PCEs (Fig. 9), demonstrating that the different blend systems with siloxane-terminated side chain are suitable for the fabrication under ambient conditions, even with a high RH. Our results will promote siloxane-terminated side chain engineering in photoactive materials towards high performing air-processability for OSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we compared the photovoltaic performances of several notable Y-series NFA based active layers PM6:Y6, PM6:L8-BO, and PM6:BTP-eC9 that were fabricated in a N2 glovebox and air with a high RH of 90%. Obviously decreased PCEs were found for these active layers when fabricated in air with high RH. It was demonstrated that casting an active layer in high humidity air should involve significant condensation of moisture, and this should be the important factor deteriorating the BHJ morphology of an active layer and weakening the device performance. The comparison of OSC performances of the PTQ10:Y6 and PQSi705:Y6 active layers processed in the N2 glovebox, air with 65% RH, and air with 93% RH indicated that PQSi705 with a siloxane-terminated side chain was beneficial for the construction of the active layer with high humidity tolerance in air-processing. AFM and TEM measurements demonstrated that very limited changes in the BHJ morphology are required to maintain device performance when PQSi705:Y6 active layers were fabricated under different conditions. Relative to the PTQ10:Y6 blend, the PQSi705:Y6 active layer was robust enough to protect against moisture and water, as revealed by superior PCE retention in long-term storage (306 days) of OSCs in air, water immersion of the active layer surface, and exposure of the active layer in boiling water vapor. Notably, PQSi705:m-TEH active layers processed in the N2 glovebox and 90% RH air showed almost identical PCEs of ∼18%. This is the highest efficiency so far reported for BHJ active layers fabricated in a high RH air. High humidity tolerance in air-processing was also achieved by PBZ-2Si:i-IEICO-4F, Si25:Y6-BO, J52:i-IESi-4F, and PBZ-2Si:i-IESi-4F active layers, suggesting certain universality when a polymer donor or a non-fullerene acceptor carry the siloxane-terminated side chain. Our results demonstrate that attaching siloxane-terminated side chains on photoactive materials is a valuable chemical countermeasure to allow air-processing and withstand large variations of humidity.

Broader context
Although the majority of organic solar cells (OSCs) are fabricated in an inert atmosphere, for example, in a N2 glovebox, high performance OSCs processed under ambient conditions should be the final goal because of advantages such as convenient manufacturing, lower equipment investment, and higher compatibility with the large-area module. Different from an inert atmosphere, ambient conditions involve oxygen and water, and the water content or relative humidity (RH) in air can be largely varied in different seasons. In rainy seasons and certain areas, more than 90% RH is possible. Herein, we demonstrate that in air with high RH, evaporation of the solvent during bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) film-formation could result in moisture condensation on the surface, and suppressing moisture condensation induced BHJ morphology damage has become a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Furthermore, we report that attaching a siloxane-terminated side chain on a photoactive material is a valuable strategy to realize high humidity tolerance of a BHJ active layer, which is helpful in keeping the morphology and device performance unchanged. This discovery highlights a new function of the siloxane-terminated side chain, which will pave the way for upgrading photoactive materials towards high performing air-processability for OSCs.

Usually, along with solvent evaporation, the moisture in air condenses onto the substrate surface to form water droplets. We propose that the hydrophobic nature of siloxane-terminated side chains of polymer PQSi705 may weaken the moisture condensation on the blend film surface even under high humidity conditions and suppress the entry of water droplets in the blend film, finally restraining water induced morphology damage to the blend film.
