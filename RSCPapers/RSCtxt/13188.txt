    , Accepted 12th July 2018First published on 1st August 2018AbstractPhotoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting implementing colloidal quantum dots (QDs) as sensitizers is a promising approach for hydrogen (H2) generation, due to the QD's size-tunable optical properties. However, the challenge of long-term stability of the QDs is still unresolved. Here, we introduce a highly stable QD-based PEC device for H2 generation using a photoanode based on a SnO2–TiO2 heterostructure, sensitized by CdSe/CdS core/thick-shell “giant” QDs. This hybrid photoanode architecture leads to an appreciable saturated photocurrent density of ∼4.7 mA cm−2, retaining an unprecedented ∼96% of its initial current density after two hours, and sustaining ∼93% after five hours of continuous irradiation under an AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated solar spectrum. Transient photoluminescence (PL) measurements demonstrate that the heterostructured SnO2–TiO2 photoanode exhibits faster electron transfer compared with the bare TiO2 photoanode. The lower electron transfer rate in the TiO2 photoanode can be attributed to slow electron kinetics in the ultraviolet regime, revealed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Graphene microplatelets were further introduced into the heterostructured photoanode, which boosted the photocurrent density to ∼5.6 mA cm−2. Our results demonstrate that the SnO2–TiO2 heterostructured photoanode holds significant potential for developing highly stable PEC cells.
Introduction
The demand for clean and renewable energy is ever growing, due to the limited availability of fossil fuels and the increasing concern of climate change caused by carbon emissions. Molecular hydrogen (H2), which has the highest energy content per unit weight1 amongst the known gaseous fuels, is a clean fuel as the only reaction by-product upon oxidation is water.2 Although H2 is not present in nature by itself, it is the main constituent element of water, which is plentiful on the Earth's surface. Currently, however, H2 is extracted from methane (CH4), as the rupture of a water molecule is an exothermic reaction. As such, it must be aided by the use of an external source of “freely” available energy.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 generation is a promising approach to produce H2 from water using solar energy, which is the cleanest and the most abundant form of renewable energy available on our planet. Due to the relative ease of H2 storage, as opposed to other forms, such as heat and electricity,3 PEC H2 generation holds a significant promise for solar energy conversion. PEC cells use wide band gap semiconductors as photoanodes, which are further sensitized using quantum dots (QDs) to extend their absorption in the visible or near-infrared (NIR) region, thereby improving their H2 generation efficiency.4,5 Although QD sensitized PEC cells have been widely studied for their appreciable efficiency in H2 production, stability is still a major concern, which drives the quest for a highly stable photoanode6,7 material for QD-based PEC cells. To the best of our knowledge, the highest stability ever recorded, recently reported for a QD-based PEC cell, is ∼94.9% of the initial current density value after two hours under one sun illumination for “giant” core/alloyed-shell CdSe/PbxCd1−xS/CdS QDs.8
Recently, a myriad of photocatalyst materials such as α-Fe2O3,9–11 TiO2,12–16 ZnO,17,18 and WO319,20 have been extensively studied for PEC H2 production. Graphitic carbon nitride21 and other novel materials22–25 have also generated immense interest in H2 and oxygen evolution reactions in recent years.26–30 Compared with other photocatalysts, SnO2 is a promising semiconducting oxide, because of its high electron mobility (∼100–200 cm2 V−1 s−1),31,32 as well as its good activity and stability during irradiation, both in acidic and basic media.33,34 In addition, SnO2 has a wider band gap (3.6 eV), compared to the widely used anatase TiO2 (3.2 eV). This creates fewer oxidative holes in the valence band under ultraviolet (UV) illumination,35 which can play a pivotal role in improving the long-term stability of PEC devices. So far, for PEC water splitting applications, SnO2 has been investigated considerably less because its conduction band minimum is lower than the reduction potential of water,36 and it suffers from low light absorption efficiency and a limited exciton separation rate.37 On the other hand, TiO2 has a favorable band alignment for water splitting; however, UV degradation is a major drawback. To address these challenges, we designed a SnO2–TiO2 heterojunction, to combine the advantages of the higher conduction band edge of TiO2, and the high stability and exceptional electronic mobility of SnO2. Moreover, the SnO2–TiO2 heterojunction has a type-II band alignment, which facilitates charge separation and transport, and has been reported36,38 to boost the performance of PEC cells.
Herein, we introduced a novel multi-heterojunction SnO2–TiO2/QD photoanode for highly stable PEC H2 generation. SnO2 mesoporous thin films were treated with the TiCl4 precursor to form TiO2 nanoparticles connecting the SnO2 nanoparticle mesoporous framework,39 thereby creating a SnO2–TiO2 heterojunction for efficient electron percolation within the anode. The metal oxide composite anode was sensitized by core/thick-shell “giant” CdSe/CdS QDs. We obtained a saturated photocurrent density of ∼4.7 mA cm−2 in a PEC cell under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The composite photoanode exhibited exceptional stability, sustaining ∼93% of its initial current density after 5 hours of continuous irradiation. Furthermore, the incorporation of 0.1 wt% of graphene in the photoanode increases the photocurrent density up to 5.6 mA cm−2. To the best of our knowledge, this device architecture has never before been investigated for PEC H2 production, and we report the highest ever stability in a QD-based PEC device for efficient H2 production.
Experimental procedure
Materials
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates of dimensions 2 cm × 1.5 cm with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω □−1 were purchased from Pilkington glasses. Ti-Nanoxide BL/SC was purchased from Solaronix and SnO2 nanopowder (99.9% tin(IV) oxide) from American Elements. Graphene microplatelets (D type) were supplied by Nanoxplore Inc., and titanium(IV) chloride (0.09 M in 20% HCl), titanium isopropoxide (99.999%), hydrochloric acid (37%), alpha-terpineol, ethyl cellulose, sulfur (100%), oleylamine (OLA) (technical grade, 70%), cadmium oxide (99%), oleic acid (OA), octadecene (ODE), selenium pellet (≥99.999%), trioctyl phosphine oxide (TOPO), trioctyl phosphine (TOP) (97%), zinc acetate dihydrate (≥98%), sodium sulfide (Na2S), sodium hydroxide, sodium sulfite (Na2SO3), hexane, toluene, methanol, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol (IPA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Inc.
Preparation of SnO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 pastes
The SnO2 nanopowder utilized consisted of nanoparticles with an average particle size of ∼20 nm. To prepare the SnO2 paste, 1 g of SnO2 nanopowder was mixed with 1 mL of water, 1 mL alpha-terpineol, 5 mL of ethanol and 0.5 g ethyl cellulose.39 These ingredients were mixed in a beaker under 12 h magnetic stirring. The solvent was removed by connecting it to a rotary pump, while under continuous magnetic stirring, until the volume of the mixture reduced to half of our starting volume. ZrO2 was utilized as a control photoanode, to determine the charge transfer dynamics in TiO2 and SnO2–TiO2 heterojunction photoanodes, because the charge transfer from QDs to ZrO2 is unfavourable. To make TiO2 and ZrO2 pastes, an identical recipe to that of the SnO2 paste was followed to achieve a similar film thickness.
Photoanode preparation
FTO coated glass substrates were cleaned by 30 min of sonication in IPA and then thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and subsequently dried under a filtered air stream.39 A thin and compact blocking layer (BL) of TiO2 was deposited on the FTO substrate by soaking the FTO substrates in 50 mM TiCl4 solution for 20 min at 70 °C; then they were flushed with deionized water and consequently annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. As a control experiment, to compare the performance of the TiO2 BL fabricated with the TiCl4 precursor, commercial TiO2 BL was spin coated on FTO glass substrates at 5000 rpm for 30 s by using the solution Ti-Nanoxide BL/SC (Solaronix), followed by annealing in air at 500 °C for 30 min, and cooled down to room temperature. Subsequently, the SnO2 paste (preparation method described earlier) was mixed with different weight concentrations of graphene and applied on the BL by the tape casting technique and dried at room temperature for 15 min to fabricate the first layer, followed by heating on a hot plate at 150 °C for 6 min. After drying, another layer of a paste of the same recipe was tape casted using a similar drying procedure and annealed in an air ambience in a furnace at 500 °C for 30 min and cooled down to room temperature. The sintered SnO2 photoanodes were dip-coated in a 50 mM TiCl4 precursor solution for 30 min at 70 °C; then they were flushed with deionized water and subsequently annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. Separately, TiOx post-treatment was carried out by spin-coating a TiOx flat film precursor solution at 2000 rpm for 60 s followed by heating at 500 °C for 30 min.40
CdSe QDs synthesis
The synthesis of CdSe QDs of diameter 1.65 nm was carried out using the hot-injection approach.5,41 TOPO (1 g) and Cd-oleate (0.38 mmol, 1 mL) in 8 mL of ODE were purged at room temperature with N2 for 30 min. The reaction system was evacuated at 100 °C for 30 min, and subsequently the temperature was increased to 300 °C. The mixture of 3 mL of OLA, TOP-Se (4 mmol, 4 mL) and 1 mL of ODE at room temperature was injected rapidly into the Cd-oleate suspension while stirring the mixture vigorously. After injection, the reaction cell was quenched with cold water. Subsequently, 20 mL of ethanol was added and then the suspension was centrifuged. Finally the supernatant was removed and the QDs were dispersed in toluene.
Synthesis of CdSe/CdS “giant” QDs
According to the procedure mentioned by Ghosh et al.,5,42 the deposition of CdS layers on CdSe QDs were achieved by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR). “Giant” CdSe/CdS QDs were prepared by subsequently growing CdS monolayers over the CdSe core. Typically, in a round-bottom flask of 100 mL, ODE (5 mL), OLA (5 mL), and CdSe QDs (∼2 × 10−7 mol in hexane) were degassed for 30 min at 110 °C. While re-storing the reaction flask in N2, the temperature was increased to 240 °C under magnetic stirring. Subsequently, the Cd(OA)2 which was dispersed in ODE (0.25 mL, 0.2 M) was added drop by drop in the mixture, and was allowed to react for 2.5 h, followed by the addition of 0.2 M sulfur in ODE, dropwise, with the same volume. Subsequently, the shell was annealed further for 10 min. All further shells were annealed at 240 °C for ∼10 min succeeding the injection of sulfur, and ∼2.5 h following the addition of Cd(OA)2 in ODE. The addition volumes of sulfur/Cd(OA)2 for shell addition cycles 1–13 were as follows: 0.25, 0.36, 0.49, 0.63, 0.8, 0.98, 1.18, 1.41, 1.66, 1.92, 2.2, 2.51 and 2.8 mL, respectively.5 Using cold water, the reaction was cooled down to room temperature. Adding ethanol, the centrifugation of the suspension was carried out to separate the supernatant. The supernatant was collected and finally the QDs were dispersed in toluene.
Sensitization of the SnO2 film with CdSe/CdS “giant” QDs
An electrophoretic deposition (EPD) process was carried out to sensitize the SnO2–TiO2 photoanode with CdSe/CdS “giant” QDs. The SnO2–TiO2 composite photoanodes on the FTO substrate were vertically immersed in the QD solution, in such a manner that the deposited films faced each other with a distance of 1 cm between them. A direct current (DC) bias of 200 V was applied for 20 min in the case of the SnO2–TiO2 photoanode and 2 h for the TiO2 photoanode.43 The photoanodes were cleaned several times with toluene to wash off the unbound QDs on the photoanode surface, and subsequently dried with N2 at room temperature.
ZnS capping layer
The ZnS capping layer was fabricated using the SILAR process. In the usual SILAR deposition cycle, Zn2+ ions were deposited from 0.1 M solution of Zn(CH3COO)2 in ethanol. The sulfide source was prepared using 0.1 M solution of Na2S in deionized water. Each SILAR cycle consisted of 1 min of dip-coating the SnO2–TiO2 or TiO2 photoanode into the Zn2+ precursors, followed by the sulfide solutions. To remove the chemical residue from the surface, the photoanode was thoroughly rinsed by dipping it into the corresponding solvent (methanol or methanol and water) after each bath, and subsequently dried with a N2 gun. Two SILAR cycles were employed to form the ZnS capping layer.
Structural characterization of the photoanode
The morphology of the photoanode was characterized using a JSM-7401F scanning electron microscope and the chemical composition was characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. XRD analysis was carried out using a Panalytical X-Pert PRO MRD system in a Bragg–Brentano geometry and Xpert Highscore was used to analyse the data. X-ray photoelectron spectra of the SnO2–TiO2/QD photoanode were recorded using a VG Scientific Escalab 220i-XL system equipped with an aluminium monochromatic source of 1486.6 eV energy, and the CasaXPS software was used for data analysis.
Photoluminescence (PL) measurements
The PL lifetime of the QDs in the photoanode films was measured using a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) mode with 408 nm and 444 nm lasers. The fitting for the decay curves was carried out using a three-component exponential decay, which gave the best fitting results. The intensity-weighted average lifetime <τ> for the PL decay was evaluated by the following equation:5 (1)where ai (i = 1, 2, 3) are the fitting coefficients of the PL decay and τi (i = 1, 2, 3) are the characteristic lifetimes. The electron transfer rate Ket is calculated from the following equation44 (the ZrO2-QD system was used as a reference, since electron transfer is not favorable from the QDs to ZrO2): (2)where 〈τ〉QDs/e scavenger and 〈τ〉QDs/ZrO2 are the average PL lifetimes of QDs/TiO2 and QDs/ZrO2, respectively.
Ultrafast transient absorption measurement
Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) of the TiO2 and ZrO2 photoanodes sensitized by QDs was carried out with a commercially available transient absorption spectrometer from Newport. A Ti:sapphire (Coherent, Libra) regenerative amplifier laser system was used as the laser source. The output of the regenerative amplifier was centered at 808 nm, at a repetition rate of 1 kHz with an average pulse energy of 3.5 mJ and a pulse width of 50 fs. The beam was split into two parts by using a 70/30 reflection/transmission (R/T) ratio beam-splitter. A major portion of the beam was used to generate the pump beam from an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-PRIME). A small portion of the fundamental beam was allowed to pass through a computer-controlled motorized delay stage (ILS-LM, Newport) and was used to generate a white-light continuum (WLC) with a spectral range of 350–850 nm by focusing it onto a 3 mm CaF2 crystal. The pump and probe beams were focused on the photoanode with a spot size of 210 μm and 80 μm, respectively. The maximum time delay that could be achieved between the pump and probe beams in our setup is 3 ns. After passing through the photoanode, the WLC probe was obtained by using a fiber coupled spectrometer coupled to a Si photodiode array (MS-260i, Oriel Instrument). Both the TiO2-QD and ZrO2-QD photoanodes were pumped at 350, 400 and 450 nm, and the differential absorbance spectra (ΔA) from a broadband probe were obtained in transmission geometry using a spectrometer. The electron transfer rate Ket is calculated from the following equation: (3)
PEC performance analysis
The PEC performance of the photoanodes was evaluated in a typical three-electrode arrangement, consisting of a QD-sensitized SnO2–TiO2 heterostructured photoanode as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode.4 The sample's surface (except for the active area) was covered with an insulating epoxy resin, to inhibit the exposure of the conducting back-contact with the electrolyte. The prepared samples were immersed in the electrolyte composed of 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 (pH ∼13), which acts as the sacrificial hole scavenger. The electrolyte solution was continuously purged with N2 to remove any dissolved oxygen before PEC analysis. During PEC measurements, the potentials measured with respect to the reference Ag/AgCl electrode were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale following the equation VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.197 + pH × (0.059).45 The photoresponse was measured by using a Class AAA Solar Simulator (model SLB-300A by Sciencetech Inc.) equipped with a 300 W xenon arc lamp as a light source with an AM 1.5 G filter under 1 sun illumination. Before every measurement, the light intensity was calibrated using a power meter and was adjusted back to 100 mW cm−2. The sweep rate for every “current versus potential” measurement was fixed at 20 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
Structure of the photoanode
SnO2 nanoparticles ∼20 nm in diameter were used for photoanode preparation. A systematic investigation of the effect of TiOx and TiCl4 treatment on the morphology and the performance in photovoltaic devices has been carried out in a previous work,39 where we found from the morphological characterization that small TiO2 nanoparticles of about 5 nm preferentially form short interconnected nanostructures in the case of TiCl4 treatment, whereas in the case of TiOx treatment, the TiO2 nanoparticles seem to cover the SnO2 nanoparticles. This kind of surface treatment plays an important role in modifying the band alignment for efficient charge separation and electron transport39 in the photoanode, as shown in detail in Fig. S1 of the ESI,† where the band diagram has been constructed by combining the data from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The advantage of using the SnO2–TiO2 heterostructure is apparent in Fig. S2,† which shows that the conduction band (CB) minima for the heterostructured photoanode have moved upwards, which eliminates the problem for a lower CB edge position in the case of pure SnO2.
In the case of TiO2, which is the commonly preferred photoanode for PEC applications, UV radiation produces excess holes, which has been attenuated by our SnO2–TiO2 heterostructured photoanode. We sensitized our composite photoanode with “giant” CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs consisting of a CdSe core of size 1.65 nm with a CdS shell of 4.3 nm thickness and a subsequent ZnS capping layer. “Giant” core/shell QD,46 a very attractive kind of core/shell QD architecture, in which a very thick shell (from several nm up to 10 nm) is over-coated around the core, has gained considerable attention for its superior chemical and photo-stability over both traditional core QDs and thin-shell QDs.47,48 By tailoring the shell thickness, these “giant” core/shell QDs can be designed to form a quasi-type II band alignment such as in CdSe/CdS “giant” core/shell QDs, where the electron and hole wave functions are spatially separated, which reduces the recombination probability, resulting in a prolonged lifetime.49 These “giant” QDs were successfully realized very recently by Adhikari et al.5 for the sensitization of TiO2 nanoparticles. We investigated the typical photoanode structure with SEM cross-sectional imaging, as reported in Fig. 1(a). The SEM analysis demonstrates the mesoporous structure of our photoanode and the thickness of our sensitized photoanode is estimated to be ∼10.7 μm. Furthermore, the chemical composition of our photoanode, presented in Fig. 1(b–h), was investigated with EDS analysis. Two-dimensional (2D) mapping of the photoanode shows the presence of the constituent elements and confirms that the CdSe/CdS core/shell “giant” QDs penetrated through the mesoporous structure and are evenly distributed throughout the photoanode. The successful penetration of the QDs in the photoanode matrix suggests efficient sensitization of the overall mesoporous structure of the composite photoanode. Furthermore, EDS line-analysis pointed out that TiO2 was homogeneously distributed within the entire volume of the SnO2–TiO2 photoanode, as displayed in Fig. 1(f). Additionally, the semi-quantitative analyses of several regions indicated that the Sn:Ti elemental ratio is 11:1. The crystalline phases, for both SnO2 and TiO2 in the SnO2–TiO2 heterostructured photoanode, can be ascribed to the rutile structure (JCPDS no. 00-041-1445 and JCPDS no. 01-088-1175 for SnO2 and TiO2, respectively). This is confirmed by the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image displayed in Fig. 1(j). The XRD peak pattern of the SnO2–TiO2/QD heterostructure sample is presented in Fig. S3(a).† The peaks are consistent with rutile SnO2 corresponding to JCPDS card no. 00-041-1445. Since the quantity of TiO2 and CdSe/CdS core/shell “giant” QDs is very low in comparison with SnO2, the effect was possibly below the detection limit of XRD. In addition, to determine the crystalline phase of the CdSe/CdS core/shell “giant” QDs, the same QD solution, which was introduced inside the photoanode to perform photoelectrochemical (PEC) tests, was drop-casted on a silicon (Si) substrate. XRD analysis was carried out using a grazing angle incidence of 0.5° to nullify the peaks from the Si substrate. The XRD pattern for CdSe/CdS core/shell “giant” QDs is presented in Fig. S3(b)† and matches perfectly with that of wurtzite CdS (JCPDS card no. 01-077-2306). Our data are consistent with previous studies, where the CdSe/CdS core/shell structure was used.50,51 In Fig. S4,† we report the high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) data for the Sn 3d, Ti 2p, Cd 3d and S 2p peaks for the SnO2–TiO2/QD heterostructured photoanode. The peak positions of Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 and the difference in binding energy between the two peaks are shown in Fig. S4(a),† and are consistent with the literature for the Sn4+ state in the case of SnO2.52 Also, as presented in Fig. S4(b),† the peak position of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 and the relative intensity ratio of these two peaks match perfectly with reports on Ti4+ for TiO2.53,54 The Cd 3d peak, which splits into Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 due to spin–orbit splitting, also agrees with the reported peak positions for Cd2+.55 The S 2p core level was deconvoluted into S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 and matches with the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peak positions attributed to the S2− state for CdS.56 In this work, we introduce a “giant” QD with a CdSe core and a thick CdS shell. Consequently, the amount of Se was very low, quantified from EDS analysis to be ∼0.05 wt%, and therefore the signal from Se was not detected by XPS.

Electron dynamics
The scheme for the integrated PEC cell, illustrating different exciton generation, transport and recombination processes during the PEC test, is displayed in Fig. 1(k). The modification of the SnO2 photoanode, forming a SnO2–TiO2 heterostructure, offers favorable band alignment for efficient electron injection into the photoanode. As shown in Fig. 1(k), the photogenerated exciton dissociation takes place at the QD; subsequently, the photogenerated electrons are injected into the heterostructured SnO2–TiO2 mesoporous anode where the electron is transported via a diffusion mechanism and collected at the front electrode. The holes subsequently oxidize the hole scavengers at the photoanode and the electrons migrate to the Pt counter electrode to produce H2. The PL spectra of CdSe/CdS “giant” QD-sensitized samples have been normalized and presented in Fig. 2(a). The PL denotes no significant change in the peak positions for different samples, indicating good optical stability of the photoanode. The lifetime for the SnO2–TiO2 and TiO2 samples in CdSe/CdS was estimated from the PL decay curves shown in Fig. 2(b) and (c), which were obtained under laser excitation of 408 nm and 444 nm, respectively. The PL lifetime decay curves reveal that the SnO2–TiO2 sample has a shorter lifetime (data presented in Table 1) of 24.19 ns, 22.02 ns compared to 27.45 ns, 24.44 ns in the case of the bare TiO2 photoanode for 408 nm and 444 nm laser excitation, respectively. The ZrO2 photoanode showed a lifetime of 29.17 ns and 29.01 ns at 408 nm and 444 nm, respectively. Based on these data, we further calculated the electron transfer rate (Ket). As shown in Table 1, the Ket of the photoanode based on heterostructured SnO2–TiO2 is higher than that of the photoanode based on bare TiO2. The higher electron transfer rate indicates less probability of exciton recombination for the generated electrons and holes; thus a better stability of the photocurrent density is expected for the heterostructured SnO2–TiO2 photoanode with respect to the bare TiO2 anode. Moreover, we found that, at a shorter excitation wavelength, i.e. 408 nm, which is closer to UV illumination, the electron transfer rate is drastically higher (∼3.5-fold) in the SnO2–TiO2 photoanode (7.1 × 106 s−1) compared with that of the TiO2 photoanode (2.2 × 106 s−1). The slower electron transfer rate of the TiO2 photoanode compared to that of the SnO2–TiO2 photoanode can be attributed to UV induced excess hole formation in the TiO2 photoanode, which increases the probability for electron–hole recombination, other than electron transfer from QDs to oxide. When moving further away from UV excitation wavelengths, i.e. at a longer wavelength (444 nm), this effect is less pronounced, where the electron transfer rate in the SnO2–TiO2 photoanode is only ∼1.5-fold higher than that of the bare TiO2 photoanode. We also measured and calculated the hole transfer rate using Na2S and Na2SO3 as hole scavengers using ZrO2 as a scaffold. The hole transfer rate is ∼9.5 × 106 s−1, indicating that the strong base solution (Na2S and Na2SO3 in water) can serve as a very strong hole scavenger.

PEC performance
The PEC performance of the SnO2 photoanodes sensitized with “giant” QDs was studied using a three-electrode electrochemical cell configuration with Pt as the counter electrode, and saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode.38 The voltage was linearly swept and converted to RHE, prior to plotting it against the photocurrent density generated under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and dark conditions.
With the increase in voltage, the photocurrent density gradually increases under illumination, until a saturated current density is obtained (Fig. 3a). The effect of different BL samples such as the TiO2 commercial BL and TiCl4 BL, which were prepared with TiOx post-treatment and TiCl4 post-treatment, is shown in Fig. S5† and Fig. 3a, respectively. The TiCl4 BL was fabricated following protocols described in the literature57 where at the optimal thickness of the compact layer, the charge transfer resistance at the FTO interface is the lowest,5,46,49 improving the charge collection and hence, the overall photocurrent density of the device. With the introduction of the TiCl4 BL, the photocurrent density was improved by 50% from 1 mA cm−2 to 1.5 mA cm−2 for TiOx post-treated devices, which is shown in Fig. S5† and nearly a 2.5-fold increment from 2 mA cm−2 to 4.7 mA cm−2 was achieved for the TiCl4 post-treated cell, which is presented in Fig. 3a. The photocurrent density was ∼10 mA cm−2 for the PEC cell based on the TiO2/QD anode, which is two-fold higher than that of PEC cells based on SnO2–TiO2/QDs. Our typical three electrode PEC experimental arrangement is demonstrated in Fig. S6(a)† and the evolution of H2 bubbles on the surface of the Pt CE can be seen in Fig. S6(b).† In this work, the structure of the PEC cells is identical except for the type of metal oxide (TiO2 or SnO2 or SnO2–TiO2). As the band energy level of SnO2 does not favor the efficient electron transfer from the QDs to SnO2, there is no photoresponse. As shown in Fig. 1k, the photogenerated electrons may recombine with the holes of QDs, or after transferring to TiO2 (or SnO2–TiO2), the electrons may recombine with the holes in the QDs (2) or electrolyte (4) during the electron transfer process. In addition, the photogenerated electrons can directly react with the electrolyte (3). In our PEC setup, the QDs, electrolyte, counter electrode (Pt), and reference electrode are the same, so the different photocurrent density is mainly due to the electron transfer rate from the QDs to the metal oxide and the possible charge recombination between the photogenerated electrons and the electrolyte. In the TiO2 photoanode, the charge transfer rate is much higher and the photoanode is very compact to facilitate the electron collection at the surface of the FTO glass before they react with the electrolyte, while in the SnO2–TiO2 anode, as shown in Fig. 1a, the SnO2 nanoparticles do not connect to each other very well even after the post-treatment of TiO2. This structure will lead to a great portion of the electrons reacting with the electrolyte before they reach the FTO glass substrate, which explains the lower current density compared to the PEC cell based on only the TiO2/QD anode. The better performance for the TiCl4 post-treated samples in comparison with the TiOx post-treated samples is due to the morphological advantage of the TiCl4 treated samples, which exhibit enhanced interconnection between the nanoparticles, as compared to the TiOx post-treated samples, which facilitate the percolation of electrons between the nanoparticles and lead to a global increase of the current.58

The stability of the photoanodes was investigated under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) AM 1.5G illumination in 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 (pH ∼13) aqueous solution and the results are reported in Fig. 3(b). Three batches of PEC samples were measured with the same PEC setup at identical temperatures (25 °C). The representative photoanodes based on heterostructured SnO2–TiO2 exhibit remarkable stability. The photocurrent density of the PEC devices based on SnO2–TiO2 retains ∼93 ± 3% of its initial value after 5 h (100 mW cm−2). To the best of our knowledge, such remarkable stability has never been reported in the literature. The TiO2 sample shows a rapid decay until it maintains only ∼79% of its initial photocurrent density as compared to ∼96% for the PEC cell based on SnO2–TiO2/QDs after 1 h of simulated solar illumination.
Although the surface treatment enhances charge transport by implementing a SnO2–TiO2 heterojunction, electrons in nanoparticle networks encounter a sufficiently large number of grain boundaries, which hinder efficient electron percolation. Recently, Dembele and co-workers demonstrated a simple and fast method to incorporate small quantities of graphene microplatelets into the TiO2 photoanode of a DSSC.59 Their investigation indicated that a small quantity of graphene does not bring a considerable reduction in the transparency of the photoanode, which is detrimental to solar cell performance; instead, small quantities of graphene increase the photocurrent density improving the overall efficiency of the photovoltaic device.59 A similar technique, for the introduction of a small amount of graphene, has been implemented in our SnO2–TiO2 photoanode architecture, where the mechanism of efficient fast electron transport through conducting graphene microplatelets has been illustrated in the proposed schematic in Fig. S7.† Compared to the SnO2–TiO2 photoanode without any graphene, the photocurrent density in the photoanode with 0.1% graphene loading is enhanced by ∼20% from 4.7 mA cm−2 to a value of ∼5.6 mA cm−2, as seen in Fig. 4(a). This remarkable enhancement of the photocurrent density might be attributed to the exceptional charge directing properties of conducting graphene pathways,59 which reduces the probability of carrier recombination, thus promoting better electron transport and collection. This value of the photocurrent density corresponds to a faradaic efficiency (FE) of ∼80% and a maximum applied bias photon-to-current conversion efficiency (ABPE) of 2.89%; see the details in note 1 of the ESI.† The chopped transient response of the photocurrent density for the SnO2–TiO2 photoanodes with and without graphene was studied for a time period of 300 s and is displayed in Fig. 3(b). The immediate transition of the photocurrent from the saturated current value to the zero value and vice versa when the shutter for the lamp source switched between the on and off positions indicates efficient charge separation in our device. Further improvement of both the efficiency and stability of the PEC cells based on the SnO2–TiO2 anode may focus on investigating the size effect of the SnO2 nanoparticle, the thickness and crystalline structure of the post-treated TiO2 layer, the size/shape/thickness of graphene microplatelets, etc.

Mechanism of fast photocurrent decay in the TiO2/QDs based photoanode
Usually, several factors may affect the photostability of PEC cells, including (i) the formation of UV induced excess holes of metal oxides (such as TiO2), which induces the formation of non-radiative recombination centres, contributing to the photooxidation process of the QDs, (ii) UV induced degradation of QDs, (iii) the corrosion of QDs due to the strong base (electrolyte, pH value of 13) and (iv) slow hole transfer rate of QDs to electrolyte, which induces hole accumulation further leading to the self-oxidation of the QDs. In our case, as the only difference between the PECs is the metal oxides, the dominant factor for the substantial difference in the stability of PECs could be the UV induced reaction between the QDs and photoinduced holes in the metal oxide. In general, the weight concentration of TiO2 in the SnO2–TiO2 photoanode is much lower compared to that of SnO2 and of course, SnO2 only absorbs UV light in the 300–330 nm range of the solar spectrum due to its large bandgap (Eg = 3.78 eV). In the case of the TiO2 anode, the excess holes under UV illumination will interact with the QDs. To confirm our hypothesis, we further carried out stability tests under UV illumination [bandpass filter (350 nm) on one sun illumination], which is reported in Fig. 3(c). In the case of the TiO2 sample, ∼49% of its initial photocurrent density is maintained after illumination under UV light for 45 min, which can be attributed to hole induced self-oxidative decomposition.60 On the other hand, in the case of the PEC cell based on SnO2–TiO2, it retained 80% of its initial current density where a decrease of 20% after 45 min is mainly due to the UV-induced degradation of the QDs.
To better understand the degradation of the photocurrent density for the TiO2 photoanode, a detailed investigation of the electron kinetics in TiO2-QDs was carried out with ultrafast TAS. The photoanode was excited with different photon energies, 3.54 eV (350 nm), 3.1 eV (400 nm), and 2.75 eV (450 nm), and probed with wavelengths of 460 nm, 484 nm and 475 nm, respectively, at various pump–probe delays. The pulse energy of the pump beam was fixed at 0.5 μJ. The differential absorbance spectra (ΔA) from the broadband probe were obtained in transmission geometry using a spectrometer, and the results are demonstrated in Fig. 5(a, c and e) for the TiO2-QD sample. The fluence of the pump beams was chosen in such a manner that the Auger recombination of the charge carriers can be avoided. A negative magnitude in the differential absorbance spectra (ΔA) corresponds to photobleaching (PB), and ideally, the PB maximum coincides with the first exciton transition observed in their absorption spectrum.61 When we introduce a pump beam of 3.54 eV energy (i.e. at 350 nm) to the TiO2-QD sample, we detect a broad response, which is possibly from the excited carriers of anatase TiO2 (3.2 eV), the CdS shell (2.5 eV) and the CdSe core (2.1 eV), and is depicted in Fig. 5(a). The prominent feature appearing in all (ΔA) spectra is a PB signal at ∼490 nm, which indicates the presence of excited carriers in the CdS shell, and has an absorption onset at ∼490 nm owing to its bandgap of 2.5 eV. In Fig. 5(c), we also notice the PB peak around 600 nm from CdSe, which has an absorption onset at ∼590 nm. A large PB is observed at ∼450 nm in Fig. 5(e) as a result of the scattering of the pump signal of the same wavelength. The data for the decay dynamics of the TiO2-QD and ZrO2-QD samples, along with the electron injection rates in the TiO2-QD sample, are presented in Table 2. The corresponding decay kinetics are fitted with a bi-exponential decay function, which resulted in a short (τS) and long (τL) lifetime. The long lifetime (τL) can be attributed to a combination of electron–hole radiative recombination and back electron transfer from the metal oxide to the QD, whereas the short lifetimes (τS) may be ascribed to either trapping or a convolution of trapping and electron transfer.62 The ZrO2-QD sample (data presented in Fig. S8†) is used as a benchmark to calculate the electron injection rates for the TiO2-QD sample, since the electron transfer from QDs to ZrO2 is not likely due to the fact that the CB minima of ZrO2 are at a higher position than the CB minima of both CdSe and CdS QDs. The electron transfer rate of the TiO2-QD sample pumped in the UV regime (at 350 nm) is determined to be 3.67 × 1010 s−1, which is lower than the electron transfer rate obtained from 400 and 450 nm pump wavelengths (i.e. 4.52 × 1010 s−1 and 5.61 × 1010 s−1, respectively). This slow electron transfer rate with 350 nm is primarily due to the electrons recombining with the excess holes present in the TiO2 nanoparticles. These excess holes originate from the formation of energetically deep traps in TiO2, which are induced by the UV illumination.63 The electrons cannot escape the deep traps, so they recombine with the holes, thereby diminishing the electron transfer rate in the UV excitation. When the TiO2-QD sample was pumped at a wavelength of 450 nm, the highest electron transfer rate of 5.61 × 1010 s−1 is recorded. This result is expected, because amongst the utilized pump wavelengths, 450 nm is closest to the CdS absorption onset at ∼490 nm; thus high electron transfer from the QDs is likely. The results from TAS measurements are in good agreement with the data obtained from the PL analyses and provides insights into the low charge transfer phenomenon of TiO2 photoanodes under UV pump excitation, thereby explaining the superior performance of our SnO2–TiO2 heterostructured photoanode over traditional TiO2 photoanodes.

Conclusions and perspectives
In conclusion, we demonstrated a novel photoanode architecture based on heterostructured SnO2–TiO2 mesoporous films, sensitized by “giant” CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs for PEC H2 generation. We achieved a saturated photocurrent density of ∼4.7 mA cm−2 with unprecedented stability, retaining 93% of the initial photocurrent density after 5 h of irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The detailed analysis with transient photoluminescence (PL) measurements demonstrates that the heterostructured SnO2–TiO2 photoanode exhibits a faster electron transfer compared to a traditional TiO2 photoanode. Lower electron transfer rates in the TiO2 photoanode can be largely attributed to slow electron kinetics in the UV regime, as revealed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. In addition, 0.1% by weight of graphene microplatelets in the heterostructured photoanode improves the photocurrent density to ∼ 5.6 mA cm−2. These results indicate that heterostructured SnO2–TiO2 can serve as a stable and efficient photoanode after sensitization by “giant” QDs, signifying that this is a very promising photoanode architecture for PEC hydrogen generation.
