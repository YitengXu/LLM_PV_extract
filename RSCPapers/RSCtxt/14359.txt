    , Accepted 15th June 2016First published on 15th June 2016AbstractThree types of linear and planar-structured donor (D)–acceptor (A) type alternating copolymers were synthesized by incorporating intrachain noncovalent Coulombic interactions, based on thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and benzothiadiazole (BT) moieties. The chain linearity and fine adjustment of interchain organization by the incorporation of different numbers of electronegative fluorine atoms onto BT, significantly affected the frontier energy levels, film morphology, and the resulting charge transport properties. The semi-crystalline morphology and charge carrier transport properties were studied by grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering and polymer field-effect transistor (PFET) characteristic measurements. A hole mobility as high as 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 in PFET was obtained for poly[2,5-bis(decyltetradecyloxy)benzene-alt-4,7-bis(thieno[3,2-b]thiophene)-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole] (PPDTT2FBT), suggesting a strong self-organization due to the linear chain configuration with conformation lock. The difluorinated PPDTT2FBT also showed the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE, 6.4%) by blending with PC71BM, but a poorer photovoltaic performance was obtained compared to the wavy-structured counterpart, poly[2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)phenylene-alt-5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole] (PPDT2FBT), reported previously. The mainly edge-on orientation of PPDTT2FBT (with π–π stacking in both xy and z directions) is attributed to the moderate PCE in the blends. Fine modulation of chain linearity may suggest an effective way to control the desirable interchain ordering and bulk film morphology for specific application in polymer solar cells or field effect transistors.
Introduction
Significant attention has been focused on designing crystalline π-conjugated polymers with chain planarity and condensed packing mode.1–3 In particular, donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating copolymers have been extensively studied for applications in polymer semiconducting devices such as polymer solar cells (PSCs) and polymer field-effect transistors (PFETs), owing to the light weight, mechanical flexibility, easy tunability of molecular structures, and solution processability for fabrication of large-area flexible devices. Recently, the development of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs has been rapidly driven by a combination of material design, interface engineering, and optimization of device geometry, showing a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼9–11% for both single and multi-junction BHJ PSCs.4–18 During the past decade, the conjugated polymer-based PFETs also made significant progress with remarkably high hole/electron mobility by the optimization of D–A copolymer structures and device fabrication conditions.19–25
To improve the carrier transport, rational molecular design needs to be carefully planned, because the chain conformation, planarity, and curvature significantly affect the bulk film morphology and charge dynamics in both PSCs and PFETs. For example, Müllen et al. designed and synthesized a series of isomeric benzodithiophene (BDT)-based conjugated polymers with different degrees of backbone curvature;26 they observed that the optical band gap increased, and the molecular ordering decreased with increasing chain curvature and concluded that a small degree of curvature is beneficial for charge carrier mobility. Besides, Pei et al. and Takimiya et al. reported that linear isoindigo-based polymers with centrosymmetric donors showed higher charge carrier motilities in PFETs compared to those with axisymmetric donors.27–29 Their studies suggest that centrosymmetric units lead to straighter backbones, which are more favorable in forming ordered solid-state structures than the wavy backbones formed by the axisymmetric ones. In addition, Hou and coworkers recently demonstrated that the curvature of a polymeric backbone plays an important role in affecting the electronic properties, film morphology, and molecular ordering of polymers.30,31 However, the molecular curvature and the resulting self-organization behaviours are hardly predicted and controlled, because of the complex intermolecular interactions and packing dependence on the molecular structures.
Recently, we reported a highly efficient semi-crystalline photovoltaic polymer, poly[2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)phenylene-alt-5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole] (PPDT2FBT) with a PCE over 9% by blending with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).10 PPDT2FBT showed highly crystalline behavior by forming nanofibrillar structures with predominant face-on π–π stacking and high vertical carrier mobility in a thick (∼300 nm) film device. Based on the interplay of noncovalent Coulombic interactions (via intra- and interchain dipole–dipole and hydrogen bonding interactions) along the polymeric backbone, the highly planar and crystalline structure was obtained by mitigating the solubility problem and avoiding complicated chemical synthesis as compared to the highly rigid π-extended structures. Previous reports on chain curvature inspired us to further optimize the molecular structure of semi-crystalline PPDT2FBT.10 The replacement of the wavy backbone in PPDT2FBT with a linear one may improve the intermolecular ordering, significantly affecting the film morphology and the resulting electrical properties.
In this study, we designed and synthesized a new series of linear chain D–A alternating copolymers (PPDTTBT, PPDTTFBT, and PPDTT2FBT) based on thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and benzothiadiazole (BT) moieties with fluorine substituents. To modulate the chain curvature, the thiophene unit in PPDT2FBT10 was replaced with thienothiophene, where the bond angle of 180° of thienothiophene attributes to the production of straight chain polymers. Mainly edge-on interchain orientation and high charge carrier transport (hole mobility up to ∼0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1) were observed by measuring grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and PFET characteristics. The linear polymeric backbone with conformational lock via intra- and interchain noncovalent Coulombic interactions induced strong self-organization of polymers, and the hole mobility improved significantly by incorporating fluorine substituents onto the polymer chain. For the PSC characterization, a moderate PCE of 6.4% was obtained by blending PPDTT2FBT and PC71BM, where a mainly edge-on orientation with a smaller vertical charge mobility was obtained compared to PPDT2FBT:PC71BM. Different chain curvatures showed a significant effect on the interchain orientation (i.e., edge-on and face-on), and the chain linearity also needs to be considered carefully for the design of polymers for specific application in PSCs or PFETs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes to the intermediates, monomers, and polymers (PPDTTBT, PPDTTFBT, and PPDTT2FBT) are shown in Scheme 1. The detailed synthetic procedures of intermediate 3 and monomer M1 are described in the ESI,† and compounds 1 and 2 and monomers (M2–M4) were prepared by following our previously reported procedures.10 The Stille coupling reaction of compound 1 and 2-(tributylstannyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (2) afforded 1,4-bisthieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2,5-bis(decyltetradecyloxy)benzene (3) in 76% yield. The lithiation of compound 3 with n-BuLi followed by the reaction with trimethyltin chloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) afforded 1,4-bis(5-trimethylstannythieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2-yl)-2,5-bis(decyltetradecyloxy)benzene (M1). Three polymers were prepared in ∼73–86% yield by the Stille coupling polymerization reaction between the corresponding monomers catalyzed by Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tolyl)3 in toluene. The detailed synthesis procedures can be found in the ESI.† All the three polymers were readily soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB).
 Scheme 1  (a) Synthetic routes to monomers and polymers. (b) Intrachain noncovalent Coulombic interactions. 
Because of the bond angle (180°) of thienothiophene, all the three polymers are expected to form a linear polymer chain. Torsional profiles and the resulting minimum energy conformations were also calculated by density functional theory (DFT, Jaguar quantum chemistry software, B3LYP/6-31G** level) in which the methyl substituent was considered for simple calculation instead of decyltetradecyl side chains. The calculated torsional profiles are presented in Fig. S1,† from which a planar chain conformation is expected. The dimethoxyphenylene-thienothiophene linkage shows the energy minimum conformation at a torsional angle of ∼23° or ∼155° via the electrostatic Coulombic attraction between Sδ+ (in thienothiophene) and Oδ− (in methoxy substituents) atoms and/or C–H⋯O dipole–dipole interactions, as shown in Scheme 1. Both the conformations may randomly distribute along the polymeric backbone in consideration of the small energy difference of ∼0.2 kcal mol−1. These noncovalent attractive interactions accumulate and interplay together along a polymeric backbone, which can significantly contribute to a planar polymer backbone even though the single noncovalent Coulombic interaction (such as S⋯O) is weak in the range 0.4–0.5 kcal mol−1.32 The linkage between thienothiophene and BT (or FBT or 2FBT) also showed a planar conformation (dihedral angle: ∼180°), where the interplay of several types of electrostatic Coulombic attractions is expected via Hδ+⋯Nδ−, Sδ+⋯Nδ−, Hδ+⋯Fδ−, and/or Sδ+⋯Fδ− (Scheme 1b).10,24,34,35 The conformationally locked linear structures may facilitate intermolecular packing and charge delocalization to enhance the charge-transporting property. The optimized energy minimum geometry and corresponding frontier orbital structures are shown in Fig. S2.† The wave function of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is delocalized along the whole polymer backbone, which could promote efficient carrier transport. However the wave function in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is mainly localized on the electron-deficient BT unit, and gradually decreased HOMO and LUMO levels were obtained with fluorine atoms because of the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the fluorine substituents.
The number-average molecular weight was determined to be 61, 57, and 67 kDa with polydispersity indices of 4.4, 3.2, and 3.3 for PPDTTBT, PPDTTFBT, and PPDTT2FBT, respectively, by using high-temperature gel permeation chromatography using o-dichlorobenzene as the eluent at 80 °C (Table 1). The thermal stability of the three polymers was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. 1d. The decomposition temperature (Td) (5% weight loss) was measured to be 359, 375, and 374 °C for PPDTTBT, PPDTTFBT, and PPDTT2FBT, respectively, indicating that the fluorinated copolymers show higher thermal stability compared to the unfluorinated one. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements under nitrogen did not show any discernible thermal events for the three polymers in the temperature range 25–350 °C (Fig. S3†).

Fig. 1 shows the normalized UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform and in film. The three polymers exhibit a similar broad optical absorption in the range 350–750 nm with two distinct high and low energy bands attributed to the localized π–π* transition and D–A internal charge transfer bands, respectively. In both the solution and film, the three polymers show a clear shoulder peak at ∼680 nm, and the shoulder peak intensity increased with the fluorine substituents, indicating strong aggregation and interchain interactions even in dilute solution. Upon solidification, the UV-vis spectra were slightly red-shifted, and the intensity of the shoulder peak increased relative to those in solution. Such a strong interchain interaction or aggregation is mostly attributed to the linear and planar conformation of polymers, which are beneficial for forming a crystalline film morphology. Optical band gaps were determined to be in the range 1.69–1.73 eV from the onsets of the absorption spectra in the film.
The electrochemical properties were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. 1c, the oxidation onset potentials of polymers were measured to be 0.48, 0.57, and 0.62 eV (relative to the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple) for PPDTTBT, PPDTTFBT, and PPDTT2FBT. The calculated HOMO energy levels of PPDTTBT, PPDTTFBT, and PPDTT2FBT are −5.19, −5.28, and −5.33 eV, respectively. The decreased HOMO levels with strongly electron-withdrawing fluorine substituents are consistent with DFT calculations; notably, the lower-lying HOMO of PPDTT2FBT is beneficial for improving the air stability and the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of BHJ PSC devices. The physical, optical, and electrochemical properties are listed in Table 1.
Field effect transistor characteristics
First, we investigated the charge carrier transport properties of the three polymers by fabrication of field-effect transistors with bottom gate and top contact geometry. Heavily doped n-type Si substrates were used as the gate electrode, and a thermally grown silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer was used as the dielectric layer after surface modification with octadecyltrichlorosilane to make the surface hydrophobic. The interdigitated structure of the source–drain contacts enabled us to determine the channel length (L = 50 μm) and width (W = 2950 μm). The hole mobility (μ) was determined using the following equation in the saturation regime: Ids = (WCi/2L) × μ × (Vgs − VT)2, where Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the SiO2 dielectric (Ci = 15 nF cm−2), Ids is the drain–source current, Vgs is the gate voltage, and VT is the threshold voltage. To determine the optimized fabrication conditions, the devices were tested at various thermal annealing temperatures (Table S1†). The output and transfer characteristics of the optimized PFET devices are shown in Fig. 2, and the typical p-type output and transfer characteristics were measured for all the polymers. The best hole mobility was obtained after the thermal treatment at 250 °C for 10 min. The best field-effect hole mobility was determined to be 0.028, 0.050, and 0.103 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PPDTTBT, PPDTTFBT, and PPDTT2FBT, respectively. The on–off ratio (Ion/Ioff) of each PFET device was also high enough at ∼106 (Table 2). The gradually increasing hole mobilities with increasing the number of fluorine substitutions in a polymer backbone are closely related to intensive intra- and/or intermolecular interactions by the noncovalent Coulombic interactions, playing an important role in producing crystalline self-organized polymers.

Notably, the pronounced interchain ordering with preferential edge-on orientation of PPDTT2FBT arising from the linear and planar structure induced ∼10 times higher charge carrier mobility than that of wavy-structured PPDT2FBT (0.013 cm2 V−1 s−1).32 The crystalline packing characteristics from the GIWAXS analysis support the good field-effect mobilities of the three polymers, which will be discussed in the following section.
Photovoltaic characteristics
The photovoltaic characteristics of the polymers with a conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Al (PEDOT:PSS, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonic acid) were investigated. To optimize the photovoltaic properties, the devices were fabricated by varying the polymer:PC71BM blend ratios (Fig. S4 and Table S2†), solvent additives (Fig. S5 and Tables S3, S4†), and active layer thickness (Fig. S6†). The PSC performances were optimized at the blend ratio of polymer:PC71BM = 1:2 (by weight) in chlorobenzene (CB):diphenylether (DPE) (97:3 by volume) with a ∼150 nm thick active layer for this series of polymers. The J–V characteristics of the PSCs without and with 3 vol% DPE are presented in Fig. 3, and the corresponding photovoltaic characteristics of the three polymers are listed in Table 3. Open-circuit voltage (VOC) increases with fluorine substituents as the HOMO level of the polymer is deepened (VOC: 0.61, 0.71, and 0.74 V; HOMOs: −5.19, −5.28, and −5.33 eV for PPDTTBT, PPDTTFBT, and PPDTT2FBT, respectively). Upon the addition of DPE as the solvent additive, the photovoltaic performances of PSCs remarkably improved. The PCE for each PSC increased approximately two-fold (PPDTTBT: 1.44→3.54%, PPDTTFBT: 2.05→5.20%, PPDTT2FBT: 2.80→6.40%) in the presence of DPE (Table S4†). This increase is mainly because of the remarkable increase in the short-circuit current density (JSC). In the case of PPDTT2FBT, the JSC increased from 5.75 mA cm−2 to 13.3 mA cm−2, and the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) also increased from 34% to 74% (Fig. 3b). The EQE spectra for the polymer:PC71BM PSCs also showed good agreement with the enhancement of JSC with DPE. A shoulder peak at ∼680 nm was clearly measured in the EQE spectra, similar to the UV-vis spectra in Fig. 1. A log–log plot of the photocurrent (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) accounts for the charge generation/extraction characteristics in BHJ PSCs (Fig. 3c).36Jph = JL − JD, where JL is the current density under light illumination, and JD is the dark current density; Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the compensation voltage when Jph = 0 mA cm−2 and V is the applied bias voltage. The Jphvs. Veff plots show that the photocurrent generation significantly improved with DPE for all the polymers. In addition, PPDTT2FBT:PC71BM showed a higher saturated Jph compared to the other two polymers, suggesting efficient charge generation/extraction with reduced e–h recombination, indicating good agreement with the device characteristics. We also investigated the thickness dependent photovoltaic properties of PPDTT2FBT:PC71BM (Fig. S6†). With increasing the active layer thickness (80–400 nm), the VOC showed little change (0.74–0.76 V) but JSC increased due to enhanced light absorption. However, the FF values decreased significantly when the thickness is over 150 nm, which indicates a serious charge recombination with increasing film thickness. We guess the different photovoltaic behavior of PPDT2FBT and PPDTT2FBT is mainly related to the different bulk heterojunction morphology and the resulting electrical properties.34,37

To investigate the bimolecular recombination in the PSC devices, the light intensity dependence of JSC was also measured. A log–log plot of the JSC as a function of light intensity is shown in Fig. 3d. By fitting the curve according to the power-law dependence of JSC on light intensity, JSC ∝ Iα(1)where I is the intensity of incident light, and α is an exponent constant for PSC devices.38 The value of α was calculated to be 0.930, 0.948, and 0.960 for PPDTTBT:PC71BM, PPDTTFBT:PC71BM, and PPDTT2FBT:PC71BM, respectively. This result suggests that the PPDTT2FBT device has the most suppressed bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions. The fluorine substituents on BT significantly improved the charge extraction with decreased e–h recombination, resulting in the higher JSC for BHJ PSCs.
Characterization of film morphology
The film morphologies were analyzed by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 4 shows the topographic and phase AFM images of polymer:PC71BM BHJ blend films without and with a processing additive, DPE. The blend films without DPE show largely phase-separated morphology, indicating strong self-aggregation of polymers with poor miscibility with PC71BM, probably because of strong self-interaction due to chain linearity, rigidity and planarity.37 The large phase separation can explain the poor exciton separation and charge extraction with the resulting low PCE values of 1.4–2.8% without DPE (Table S4†). Surprisingly, the BHJ film morphologies dramatically changed after adding DPE. Upon the addition of DPE, the reorganization of the polymers and PC71BM occurred with well-intermixed and finely separated phase domains, allowing efficient charge separation and extraction. The root mean square (RMS) roughness significantly decreased due to the solvent additive from 11.8, 9.19, and 6.56 nm to 2.18, 1.89, and 1.99 nm for PPDTTBT, PPDTTFBT, and PPDTT2FBT blend films, respectively. The improvement in JSC is clearly supported by the well-mixed and smooth morphology of the processing additive.

PPDTTBT (a, d, g, j), PPDTTFBT (b, e, h, k), PPDTT2FBT (c, f, i, l) BHJ films deposited on ITO/PEDOT:PSS under the same conditions for the optimized BHJ PSCs. RMS roughness values are at the right-bottom of each image. 
To investigate the internal morphology of the polymer:PC71BM BHJ films, we analyzed high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images (Fig. S7†). An interpenetrating networked morphology is apparent in all BHJ films with DPE in which the polymer nanofibrillar structures are well-dispersed in the blend films. In particular, the PPDTT2FBT:PC71BM film presents the most finely and well-distributed fibrillar structure which is expected to induce efficient charge transport with suppressed bimolecular recombination, enhancing JSC and FF.10,39 The observation of HR-TEM is well consistent with the photovoltaic characteristics.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was also carried out to characterize the interchain packing of polymers in the pristine and blended films (Fig. 5 and S8†). The packing parameters of GIWAXS measurements are listed in Table S5.† The pristine films show interlamellar scattering peaks along the z direction up to (300) with mainly edge-on orientation, which is stronger with fluorine substituents, suggesting the clear contribution of fluorine atoms to intermolecular interactions via dipole–dipole attraction (Sδ+⋯Fδ−, Hδ+⋯Fδ−). All the pristine polymers show a π–π stacking peak (010) in the out-of-plane direction together with a (010) peak in the in-plane direction (Fig. 5a–c). In organic semiconductors, the co-existence of both edge-on and face-on packing patterns suggests the formation of a three-dimensionally networked conjugated structure, which is beneficial for charge transport via interchain hopping.40 The interlamellar d-spacing of ∼24–26 Å was calculated from the in-plane (100) peak and ∼21–23 Å from the out-of-plane (100) peak for all the polymers in both the pristine and blended films. After blending with PC71BM, the face-on π–π stacking (d-spacing ∼3.5–3.6 Å) remains for the fluorinated PPDTTFBT and PPDTT2FBT polymers, but that of PPDTTBT:PC71BM almost disappeared. This indicates that the fluorine substituents show a clear contribution to the formation of tight interchain packing of polymers.

The vertical carrier mobilities in polymer:PC71BM BHJ films were measured by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S9†). The J–V characteristics follow a Mott–Gurney relationship over a range of several volts.41 The measured hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities were μh = 2.88 × 10−5, 1.44 × 10−5 and 6.86 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and μe = 2.34 × 10−4, 2.07 × 10−4 and 2.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PPDTTBT, PPDTTFBT and PPDTT2FBT blend films, respectively. The PPDTT2FBT:PC71BM showed the highest hole mobility and the most balanced hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe = 3.15), which support the highest PCE of PPDTT2FBT:PC71BM among the three polymer blends. However, the μh and μe values are still ∼10 times lower than those of PPDT2FBT:PC71BM (μh = 3.0 × 10−3 and μe = 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).10 The lower vertical charge mobility in PPDTT2FBT:PC71BM (compared to PPDT2FBT:PC71BM) is consistent with the measured GIWAXS film orientation (predominantly edge-on in PPDTT2FBT:PC71BM vs. face-on orientation in PPDT2FBT:PC71BM) which limits efficient charge transport and collection in the vertical direction.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we synthesized a series of linearly structured, conjugated D–A copolymers based on thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and benzothiadiazole with different numbers of fluorine substituents. All the polymers present planar conformation via noncovalent Coulombic interactions by way of S⋯O, O⋯H, S⋯F, C–H⋯F, and C–H⋯N, inducing “conformational lock” of the main chain with semi-crystalline intermolecular ordering. Compared to the previously reported wavy-structured PPDT2FBT, the straight PPDTT2FBT polymer showed ∼1 order higher hole mobility in the PFET device configuration. In addition, with increasing number of fluorine substituents, the field-effect hole mobility increased approximately three-fold (0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PPDTTBT to 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PPDTT2FBT) via tight self-organization, because of enhanced intra- and/or interchain noncovalent Coulombic interactions. A moderate PCE (6.4%) was obtained for the BHJ polymer solar cell of PPDTT2FBT:PC71BM, which is poorer than that of the wavy counterpart (PPDT2FBT:PC71BM). Notably, a markedly modulated polymer backbone configuration (curved vs. linear) from PPDT2FBT to PPDTT2FBT affected the self-organization pattern, which in turn also affected the film morphology, miscibility with fullerene derivatives, and resulting device properties of the PFETs and PSCs. Not only the coplanarity of the polymer backbone but also the degree of curvature needs to be considered carefully for the fine-modulation of crystalline morphology for specific device applications.
Experimental section
General

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL (JNM-AL300) FT NMR system operating at 300 MHz and 75 MHz, respectively. UV-vis spectra were obtained with a JASCO V-630 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry data were obtained on a Versa STAT 3 (Princeton Applied Research) with a three-electrode cell employing a platinum wire as a counter electrode, platinum electrode coated with a thin polymer film as a working electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as a reference electrode in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Bu4NBF4) in CH3CN at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The number- and weight-average molecular weights of the polymers were determined relative to a polystyrene standard with o-dichlorobenzene as the eluent at 80 °C using gel permeation chromatography (Agilent GPC 1200 series). Thermogravimetric analysis (2050 TGA V5.4A) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC Q200 V24.4) measurements were performed at a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen (purity, 99.999%). The atomic force microscopy images (1.5 μm × 1.5 μm) were obtained using a Veeco AFM microscope in tapping mode. GIWAXS measurements were conducted at the PLS-II 9A U-SAXS beam line of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory.
PSC fabrication & measurement
ITO coated glasses were cleaned with distilled water, acetone, and isopropanol, in sequence. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron Al4083) was spin-coated onto the ITO substrate and annealed at 140 °C for 10 min. To prepare the BHJ films, the polymer was blended with PC71BM with a 1:2 weight ratio (14 mg mL−1) in a CB:DPE (97:3 v/v) mixed solvent. On top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, BHJ films were spin-cast in a N2 filled glove box. Next, the device was pumped down under vacuum (<10−6 Torr), and Al (100 nm) was deposited. The area of the Al electrode defines the active area of the device as 13.0 mm2. Measurements were carried out inside a glove box by using a high quality optical fiber to guide the light from a solar simulator equipped with a Keithley 2635A source measurement unit. A mask (13.0 mm2) made of a thin metal was attached for the photovoltaic characteristic measurements under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. EQE measurements were performed using a PV measurement QE system using monochromatic light from a xenon lamp under ambient conditions. The monochromatic light was chopped at 100 Hz and the intensity was calibrated relative to a standard Si photodiode using a lock-in-amplifier. Vertical electron and hole carrier mobilities were measured with the SCLC method by fabricating the hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au) and electron-only (FTO/active layer/Al, FTO: fluorine-doped tin oxide) diodes.
PFET fabrication & measurement
PFET devices were fabricated in a top contact and bottom gate structure. Heavily doped n-type Si substrates were used as a gate electrode, and a thermally grown silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer was used as the dielectric layer. The SiO2/Si substrates were sequentially cleaned with acetone and isopropanol, and dried in an oven at 100 °C for 1 h. After drying, the substrates were moved into a N2 filled glove box. Before deposition of the polymer layer, the SiO2 surface was modified with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS-8) to make the surface hydrophobic. The pristine polymer layer was spin-cast on top of the OTS-8 modified SiO2 layer from the solution (5 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene) at 1700 rpm. Au (50 nm) as the source and drain electrodes was thermally evaporated under vacuum (∼10−6 Torr). Electrical characterization was performed under nitrogen using a Keithley semiconductor parametric analyzer (Keithley 4200-SCS).
