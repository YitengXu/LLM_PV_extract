, Accepted 27th June 2023First published on 11th July 2023AbstractTransparent photovoltaics (TPVs) have become a vital research area in recent years due to their potential applications in see-through surfaces such as windows, building facades, and mobile electronics. However, the limitations of material selectivity, optical transmission, and color neutrality associated with existing TPV technologies have hindered their widespread implementation. There is a critical need for a universal TPV technology that can be applied to comprehensive photovoltaic systems, offers high transmittance in the visible spectrum, and shows no deviation in chromaticity coordinates. In this study, we propose a durable, flexible and cost-effective approach for treating standard non-fullerene materials in organic photovoltaic systems, utilizing an air-cooling nanosecond laser processing system to achieve enhanced performance. Varying the hexagonal width processing allows agility in controlling the optical transmission properties of the overall photovoltaic structure. Additionally, we deposit a tungsten oxide layer as a buffer against the high-power laser to increase the reliability of our treatment. By limiting the depth of the thermal damage effect, only three achromic layers of glass, indium tin oxide, and zinc oxide remain for the transparent region, resulting in a high average visible transmittance (AVT > 65%) of the TPV device with no color deviation. We believe that the collaboration of the buffer layer with an air-cooling nanosecond laser as the processing light source expands the applicability of our treatment and could pave the way for commercializing TPVs as a significant player in the renewable energy market.
1. Introduction
In order to advance sustainable energy, the field of energy conversion continuously seeks new processes to achieve cost-effectiveness.1 Photovoltaic technology, which converts photons into electricity from light sources such as sunlight and indoor lighting, exemplifies this process. Solar power systems are typically installed in areas with abundant sunlight and large surface areas, and the energy produced is then transmitted to cities or regions in need via energy storage. However, the location of photovoltaic systems is critical to their implementation, as significant energy loss can occur during transmission. To mitigate this issue, photovoltaic cells should be placed close to the application site or directly integrated into electronic products to reduce energy loss during transmission. Therefore, it is essential to develop photovoltaic technology with additional features that cater to diverse application environments.2–4
Transparent photovoltaics (TPVs) have recently gained significant attention in the solar industry and have been investigated using various methods, including non-selective TPVs,5–10 ultraviolet/infrared-selective TPVs,11–14 luminescent solar concentrators,15–19 and scattering solar concentrators.7 Amongst these, organic systems are favored as the next-generation semiconductor material due to their characteristics such as lightness,20–22 transparency, and flexibility in material molecular design. Following the previous work, it has been suggested that organic molecules can modify the molecular structure to control specific absorption wavelengths. Based on this feasibility, organic photovoltaics have been proposed for developing different types of TPV applications, such as wearable electronics and solar windows. Thus, organic TPVs appear to be the best candidate for achieving high transmittance values (>75%) by designing the light-absorbing properties of the active layer material and utilizing ultra-thin metals as transparent electrodes. The organic donor and acceptor layers must be well optimized in the active layer to form heterojunction interfaces for dissociating excitons and converting photocurrent without affecting transparency.23 Although the design rule has already been discussed in previous literature, it is still common for standard organic photovoltaics (OPVs) to utilize fullerene acceptor materials, such as C7024 and PC71BM,25,26 in the active layer. However, this can impact the TPV characteristics, specifically visible light transmission, and raise concerns regarding color deviation. To address this issue, a straightforward methodology for processing standard OPVs with high transparency and power conversion efficiency needs to be developed that does not circumvent restrictions on structural and organic material selection.
Recently, a non-selective device has been developed that involves patterning transparent regions on the original structure to enhance optical transmission properties. This approach suggests that laser processing is an effective technique, which has been widely employed in the semiconductor industry in recent years. Laser processing offers several advantages, such as rapid fabrication and straightforward pattern definition. It can also accommodate various processes, including etching, cutting, and hole drilling. Based on this concept, the dry etching method has been utilized for patterning indium tin oxide (ITO)27 or other metal electrodes28 to fabricate efficient organic light-emitting diodes. Additionally, laser processing can efficiently mitigate dead area losses during the series connection of components, making it suitable for processing perovskite solar cell modules in recent years.29 However, a vital issue during laser processing is the high energy power that may induce thermal effects, leading to substrate or material degradation. To address this challenge, numerous research teams are exploring the use of femtosecond lasers with shorter pulses as a means to boost process yield without compromising the integrity of the material. Nonetheless, this solution may entail elevated equipment and maintenance costs, which poses a significant concern for manufacturing companies.30
Considering the existing research gap in cost-effective laser processes for patterned organic photovoltaics in the solar energy field, this study aims to address this limitation by utilizing a low-cost nanosecond laser for processing transparent polymer organic photovoltaics with an active layer of PBDB-T-2F (PM6):BTP-4F (Y6). Our optimized process involves the utilization of a WO3 laser buffer layer (LBL) to maintain micrometer patterns in the anode, organic layer, and cathode electrode without any thermal effects. The LBL absorbs the overshooting laser energy, reducing unpredictable damage during the process and improving the process yield (>83%). For patterned transparent devices, we analyzed the pattern size to modify the transmittance value of organic TPVs from 36.94 to 65.84%, depending on the hexagonal pattern's size. Importantly, our proposed TPV with an optimized hexagonal width of 314 μm exhibits non-selective characteristics in CIE color coordinates, appearing similar to the natural color of the bare glass.31,32
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Tungsten trioxide (WO3), molybdenum (VI) oxide (MoO3), and zinc acetate dihydrate were acquired from Alfa Aesar. Ethanolamine, 2-methoxyethanol, chloroform, chloronaphthalene, and silver (Ag) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. PBDB-T-2F (PM6) and BTP-4F (Y6) were procured from 1-materials. Indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω/□ was purchased from Lumtec Corporation.
2.2 Device fabrication
ZnO solution was prepared by dissolving 220 mg of zinc acetate dihydrate in a mixture of 2-methoxyethanol (2 ml) and ethanolamine (60 μl) and stirred continuously overnight. Subsequently, the PM6:Y6 solution was prepared in chloroform at a concentration of 17.5 mg ml−1 with a ratio of 1:1.2. To this mixture, 0.5% of chloronaphthalene was added and stirred for 4 hours. For the device fabrication, patterned ITO substrates were initially cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol using ultrasonication and further treated with UV-Ozone for 20 minutes. The prepared ZnO solution was then spin-coated on the ITO substrate at a speed of 5000 rpm for 30 seconds, resulting in a thickness of 15 nm, and then annealed at 200 °C for 15 minutes. Subsequently, the active layer of PM6:Y6 with a thickness of 90 nm was spin-coated onto the ZnO layer in a N2 environment at 6000 rpm for 50 seconds, followed by annealing at 110 °C for 10 minutes. Finally, thermal evaporation was utilized to deposit MoO3 (7 nm), Ag (100 nm), and WO3 (100 nm) at the deposition rates of 0.2, 3, and 0.5 Å s−1, respectively. The uncovered device was then subjected to scratching under ambient conditions using a 355 nm (3 mW) air cooling laser, with a frequency of 63 kHz, a speed of 500 mm s−1, and a pulse width of 12 μs.
2.3 Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) plot of the devices was obtained using an Enlitech solar simulator (SS-X100R) under AM 1.5G illumination and calibrated with a silicon cell. The measurements were conducted at a temperature of 25 °C in air, using a voltage scan rate of 100 mV s−1 ranging from −0.5 to 1.5 V using a source meter (Keithley 2400). External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using the Enlitech QE system (QE-R3011). The ultraviolet and visible (UV-vis) spectra were acquired using a Jasco UV-visible spectrophotometer (V-700) in an ambient environment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) images were obtained using a Phenom World Pro desktop SEM.
3. Results and discussion
In the schematic representation of the OPV device shown in Fig. 1a, ITO serves as the cathode, while ZnO and PM6:Y6 function as the electron transport layer and active layer, respectively. Additionally, MoO3 and Ag serve as the hole transport layer and electrode. Notably, WO3 is incorporated as the LBL material in this device. In this study, we have chosen a hexagonal pattern for the transparent area due to its superior balance between the electrical and transmission properties of the devices. Previous research has focused on various patterns such as circular, rectangular, and hexagonal, each with its merits and demerits. For instance, circular patterns tend to exhibit improved electrical properties after processing, but their graphic arrangement requires large and closely spaced circles to achieve high transparency. However, this close arrangement may result in reduced spacing between the anode and the cathode, leading to non-transparent (active) areas. The transmission properties of the TPVs are restricted due to this limitation, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). On the other hand, squares may offer better characteristics and space utilization, they can compromise electrical properties. Thus, we have opted for a hexagonal pattern for the transparent area, as it strikes a good balance between transmission properties and electrical performance for TPV.

3.1. The laser buffer layer and their process yield
We uitilized an air-cooled nanosecond laser with a 355 nm wavelength as the energy source in our experiment and it was mentioned in the preface that this type of laser could potentially cause a more significant thermal effect than the commonly used femtosecond laser. To mitigate this concern, we employed a 100 nm thick WO3 layer as the LBL. The purpose of the LBL was to enable the laser light to pass through the active area of the WO3 layer, which absorbs the incident energy before it enters into the structure. This approach helps to slow down the damage caused by the thermal effect on the devices.
Fig. 2a and b illustrate the SEM and EDX spectroscopy images after laser processing with or without the LBL. In the processed area without the LBL, a clear indium signal was observed, indicating that the thermal effect from laser processing penetrated deeply into the ITO layer, leading to short-circuiting between the cathode and the anode of the structure. On the other hand, when a 100 nm WO3 layer was introduced as an LBL, the processed area exhibited a clear zinc signal, as shown in Fig. 2b. This result indicates that the introduction of the LBL effectively controlled the penetration of the thermal effect on the structure, confining it to the ZnO layer. Additionally, the introduction of the LBL not only improved the absorbance signals but also significantly reduced the occurrence of short-circuiting.

Fig. 2c and d, depict the results of measuring Pmax in 12 fabricated devices, with and without LBL, respectively. The Pmax performance in Fig. 2c, which was obtained without the LBL protection during the laser process, indicates a value lower than 0.1 mW. This observation confirms that the absence of the LBL caused a short circuit in the devices. Consequently, these devices are prone to short-circuiting due to the thermal effect of the laser process, leading to a low process yield of only 50%. On the other hand, Fig. 2d presents the best Pmax performance achieved, which was lower than 0.1 mW, after introducing the LBL. This indicates that the LBL effectively protects the devices from damage during the laser process. Out of the 12 devices with LBLs, 10 devices exhibited good power performance, leading to an overall process yield of 83%, which is a significant improvement compared to the yield without LBL (50%).
3.2. Effect of hexagonal pattern width on optical transmission properties
Effective pattern design plays a crucial role in determining the appearance and transmission properties of electronic devices. The spacing between hexagonal patterns can significantly impact the design's suitability for specific application scenarios. For example, when the user and the device are at a distance, the human eye's sensitivity to lines is reduced, allowing for larger hexagonal spacing that results in a uniform surface appearance. Conversely, in close-distance scenarios, where the human eye's recognition capability is heightened, smaller hexagonal spacing is required to maintain transmission properties.33 To determine the hexagon spacing, eqn (1) can be used, which considers the specific application scenario. This work proposes to use 25 μm as the spacing between the hexagons. After calculating such a spacing through eqn (1), it can be known that the human eye cannot clearly see the pattern at an application distance of 8.59 cm, which also means that the 25 μm spacing can fit the distance between the eye and the device. This indicates that the application distance can be greater than 8.6 cm and the designed pattern will not have any adverse effect on the transmission property. 
(1)where L is the distance between the OPV and the eye and S is the spacing between the hexagons.
To achieve effective control over the transmission properties of TPV systems, it is crucial to carefully adjust the size of the hexagonal pattern, and in particular, to optimize the width (W) of the hexagons. During the laser process, the size of the hexagon is constrained by the size of the laser beam, which in this particular case a diameter of 30 μm is utilized. If W of the hexagon is designed to be less than 50 μm, the resulting pattern will be distorted and resemble a circular shape instead of a hexagon. To preserve the integrity of the hexagonal shape, it is necessary to maintain a width larger than 50 μm, as demonstrated in Fig. S2 (ESI†). To ensure a consistent and suitable design, we opted to use a series of hexagon widths including 60, 93, 153, 200, 260, and 314 μm, with 60 μm being the smallest width chosen. The optical microscope images of various hexagon widths are presented in Fig. 3(a–f). Interestingly, irrespective of the size of the hexagons, the pattern remains fixed at a side length (S) of 25 μm, indicating that the laser beam size does not cause any distortion to the pattern.

Fig. 4a illustrates the optical transmission spectra of TPVs with different hexagon widths W. The trend observed in these spectra indicates that as the width of the hexagon increases, its transmittance of TPVs also increases. Specifically, the average visible transmittance (AVT) values of TPV devices were found to be 36.94%, 52.23%, 56.01%, 59.68%, 61.01%, and 65.84%, for hexagon W of 60 μm, 93 μm, 153 μm, 200 μm, 260 μm, and 314 μm, respectively. Based on our work, we utilized a laser process to eliminate the LBL, Ag, MoO3, and PM6:Y6 layers, resulting in a laser-etched area that enhances the optical transmission characteristics. As a result, the remaining glass substrate, ITO, and ZnO dominate the transmission properties of the laser area, leading to a similar optical performance of TPVs. This approach enables the TPVs to achieve high performance without any color shift, which is a significant improvement. By virtue of this unique characteristic, modifying the hexagon width W enables precise control over the optical transmission characteristics of TPVs, allowing for effortless adjustment of the active area via laser processing without any concern regarding alterations to the color shift of the transmission spectra.
 Fig. 4  (a) Plot of transmittance versus wavelength for varying widths of the hexagon. (b) Representation of the color coordinates of the TPVs with different hexagon widths on the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram. 
The CIE1931 color coordinates of the devices under the D6 light source are presented in Fig. 4b. The CIE1931 color coordinates (x, y) of TPV devices with different W are 0.32, 0.33 (60 μm), 0.32, 0.34 (93 μm), 0.32, 0.33 (153 μm), 0.32, 0.33 (200 μm), 0.32, 0.33 (260 μm), and 0.32, 0.34 (314 μm), respectively. These values indicate the deviation of the device color under different W conditions, and it can be observed that the TPV devices demonstrate consistent performance in the CIE1931 color coordinates without any noticeable color shift.
This consistency may be attributed to the fact that the TPV devices absorb visible light within the range of 380 nm to 740 nm (as shown in Fig. 4a), and the transmission spectra of the devices are not influenced by this visible light. Among the different methods used in TPV fabrication as outlined in the introduction, our findings indicate that the optical transmission property was predominantly influenced by ITO/ZnO. Hence, the method employed can be categorized as non-selective. This property serves as compelling evidence for the TPV's ability to efficiently harness the full spectrum of energy through its active layers, thereby demonstrating its potential for achieving superior performance in the CIE1931 color coordinates. This, in turn, enables TPVs to achieve remarkable levels of performance that approach the natural color, highlighting its immense potential as a cutting-edge technology.
3.3. Electrical properties of TPVs before and after laser process
In order to assess the potential impact of laser processing on the active area of TPV, it is crucial to accurately calculate the actual active area and obtain reliable values of current density (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). The current study indicates that it may be necessary to reduce a portion of the active area to achieve the desired optical transmission properties of TPV. Eqn (2) can be utilized to calculate the actual active area for various values of W, which enables the determination of Jsc, PCE, Jsc*, and PCE* corresponding to both the initial (Jsc and PCE) and actual (Jsc* and PCE*) active areas.
The J–V characteristics of TPVs under different hexagon widths W are shown in Fig. 5a. It has been observed that increasing W results in a decrease in Jsc. This is because increasing W leads to an increase in the transparent area of laser processing, which consequently reduces the active area. To clarify, the combined laser area and active area of the TPV device remain constant at 0.04 cm2, and Jsc is determined based on this actual active area, which is smaller than the initial area (0.04 cm2) due to the non-contributing laser area. Interestingly, the TPV device exhibits the highest Jsc and PCE when W is smallest (60 μm). As W increases, the optical transmission of the TPV device improves, resulting in lower Jsc and PCE. Moreover, the decrease in Jsc can be attributed to the influence of the hexagon pattern W on the actual active area, and the optical and electrical properties are mutually affected when calculating the initial active area.

(c) External quantum efficiency (EQE) and integral current density of the initial PV and TPV. (d) Comparison of the power conversion efficiency achieved in this work with previously reported values.34–45 
Based on the J–V plots presented in Fig. 5b, it can be observed that the calculated Jsc* and Voc values show consistent trends under different W conditions, indicating that the electrical properties within the active area of the TPVs remain unaffected by laser processing. Furthermore, the trends in the PCE values before and after laser processing are also similar, which suggests that the laser processing of the structure does not cause any damage to the electrical properties of the PV. Thus, this work demonstrates the advantage of maintaining the initial PV electrical properties without being limited by the laser pattern.
Table 1 presents the electrical characteristics of TPV devices with varying hexagon widths for both initial and actual active areas. Increasing the hexagon width from 60 μm to 314 μm generally results in a decrease in Jsc and PCE values. Upon correcting for the actual device area using eqn (2), a slight decrease in Jsc* is observed, while PCE* remains relatively stable or experiences a slight decrease. The comparison between PCE* and initial PCE values of the devices reveal a decrease from the original value of 13.15% to approximately 10%. This reduction can be attributed to a decrease in fill factor (FF) resulting from a reduction in sheet resistance caused by the laser patterning of the electrodes. It is important to note that this comparison is specifically limited to the initial devices and TPVs. In organic solar cells, the FF is commonly influenced by the balance between hole and electron transport, which can be affected by various factors such as organic materials used, device structure design, and the transport capabilities of the electrodes.46 In this study, an initially well-performing thick metal electrode underwent laser processing, resulting in a transformation from a continuous plane to a width-limited transport region of only 50 μm. This change in electrode morphology impacted the sheet resistance, leading to a decrease in the FF. Consequently, TPV devices exhibited a decreasing trend in the FF after laser processing compared to their performance prior to processing. However, it is noteworthy that this decrease in FF cannot be mitigated by increasing the width of the hexagonal pattern. Overall, the results demonstrate a similar trend between TPVs Jsc* and the initial devices Jsc when the actual device area is considered. These findings emphasize the significance of considering the actual device area and electrode patterning when designing and optimizing TPV devices for long-term performance stability.

W is the hexagon width, and S is the spacing between the hexagons.
Fig. 5c shows the EQE of TPVs under different hexagon widths W, alongside the initial PV, as mentioned in Fig. 5a. The EQE trend of TPV is affected by the laser area, thus an increase in W leads to a decrease in EQE intensity. On the other hand, the decrease in EQE in TPVs, compared to the initial PV, was observed, and a decreasing trend is seen as illustrated in Fig. 5. This suggests that the laser patterns do not impact the energy generation of TPVs across various wavelengths, but rather the total density is dominated by the active area. This phenomenon is consistent with the previously mentioned observation that the TPV's actual active layer has the capacity to maintain its electrical performance. Fig. 5d presents a PCE vs. AVT plot for non-selective organic TPVs in recent years, including the result of this work. In comparison to other non-selective organic TPVs, this work exhibits a marked improvement in AVT capability, and it is noteworthy that the TPV's AVT can be controlled by making simple pattern changes. Specifically, when W = 314 μm, the AVT performance reaches an impressive 65.84%, which stands out as the best AVT performance achieved among non-selective organic TPVs in recent years.
4. Conclusions
In summary, our innovative technology involves utilizing a laser process to deposit a buffer layer, thereby enhancing the transmission properties and laser process yield of polymer organic solar cells. Our approach is highly novel, as it employs a nanosecond laser for LBL deposition, which is more cost-effective and can achieve comparable success rates compared to previous studies. By accurately calculating the active area, we optimized the performance of organic solar cells with PM6:Y6. In addition, we utilized different hexagon widths as a basis for attaining different transmission properties, ranging from 36.94% to 65.84%, depending on the hexagon side length of 60, 93, 153, 200, 260, and 314 μm. Our method maintains stable color coordinates, ensuring natural color transparency. We believe that our advanced process technology, coupled with an innovative LBL approach, can pave the way for developing other types of solar cells, such as small molecule organic solar cells, polymer organic solar cells, or perovskite solar cells, for TPV production. The successful implementation of our cutting-edge technology has the potential to significantly advance the solar energy industry, optimizing solar cell fabrication processes to achieve higher levels of energy harvesting efficiency, while also reducing costs.
