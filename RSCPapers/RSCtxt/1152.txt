    , Accepted 6th July 2012First published on 6th July 2012AbstractNearly monodisperse lead chalcogenide (PbE, E = S, Se, or Te) semiconductor quantum dots of controllable shape have been produced via a novel synthesis which includes the occurrence of in situ formed Pb0 particles. Tunable size and shape are achieved through appropriate choice of the precursor type and the stabilizer. As precursor, we use, on the one hand, lead oxide or lead acetate, on the other hand, tellurium, selenium, or sulfur powder dissolved in trioctylphosphine (TOP), tributylphosphine (TBP), or 1-octadecene (ODE). Oleic acid (OA) and various amines, as well as TOP and TBP are used for stabilization. With respect to possible application in hybrid solar cells, the surface of as-synthesized spherical PbSe nanocrystals was investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As an important result, it was found that the surface is not mostly covered by oleic acid after synthesis, but by a phosphorus compound. We also applied a ligand exchange procedure with hexylamine and found evidence for the successful attachment of hexylamine to the nanocrystal surface. Additionally, charge separation between these nanoparticles and the conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is studied by electron spin resonance and photoinduced absorption spectroscopy. The spectra obtained suggest that charges can be produced successfully by photoinduced charge transfer.
1. Introduction
Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, such as lead sulfide (PbS), lead selenide (PbSe) and lead telluride (PbTe), are of high interest because of their unique size-dependent properties, which offer a wide range of applications in low cost photodetectors,1,2 photovoltaics,3–5 optical modulators,6 and optical sources.1 Due to the quantum size effect, the synthetic control of shape and size by variation of reaction conditions enables controlled tuning of their optical properties.4
Due to the large exciton Bohr radius of Pb chalcogenides,7 the energy gap and, therefore, also the size-dependent absorption and photoluminescence can be tuned over a wide range covering the near-infrared spectral region.3 The large dielectric constant,5,8 efficient multiple exciton generation,3,4 and high carrier mobility6 make the Pb compounds attractive for use as photoactive material in solar cells.
In so-called hybrid solar cells, inorganic semiconducting nanocrystals (NCs) which serve as electron acceptors are blended with an organic semiconductor, normally a conjugated polymer like regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), which acts as an electron donor.9 The charge separation between a donor and an acceptor can be studied by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy,10–12 which detects the unpaired spin of polarons, and by photoinduced absorption (PIA) spectroscopy,13 which monitors the change in the transmission of a NC–polymer blend due to optical transitions involving polaronic states. Reports on the absolute energetic position of the energy levels of PbSe nanocrystals suggest a possible charge separation between P3HT and sufficiently small PbSe NCs in hybrid films.4 However, a recent PIA study of blends of small PbSe NCs and P3HT did not show a sign for successful charge separation at the donor/acceptor interface.13 Thus, there is still a controversial discussion, and it remains unclear, why PbSe–polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells have achieved a power conversion efficiency of only 0.1%, so far.4,13
The lack in the understanding of the principle problems of these solar cells pushes forward fields of nanochemistry, such as the development of new synthetic routes and the modification of the nanoparticle surface. Improved knowledge on synthesis methods, their mechanisms as well as post-synthetic cleaning and surface-modification procedures might be the key to more efficient devices. The high-temperature solution phase synthesis appears to be the most suitable method to synthesize nearly monodisperse PbE NCs,14–17 but the existence of a ligand shell surrounding NCs is often a major hindrance for their further application.11 Thus, ligand exchange is used to improve the surface properties of the NCs, but the organic ligands are often strongly bound to the surface. Consequently, the procedure of surface modification can be more complicated as it may appear. For example, in the case of CdSe, it was recently shown that common stabilizers such as oleic acid cannot be completely removed when applying a ligand exchange with pyridine11 or alkylamines.12 In the case of lead chalcogenide nanocrystals, there are just a few reports on ligand exchange procedures.18,19
In the following, we present an alternative hot-injection synthetic route, providing high-quality PbE NCs with narrow size distribution and different shapes, which includes the occurrence of in situ formed Pb0 particles. We demonstrate size and shape control by systematic variation of the materials employed (precursors and stabilizers) and their concentrations. We used oleic acid and phosphorus compounds as stabilizers in the synthesis and investigated their presence on the surface of the resulting nanocrystals. In view of the application of PbSe NCs in solar cells, we also developed a ligand exchange procedure with hexylamine and investigated the ligand exchange process with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Finally, we will show results from ESR and PIA measurements performed on blends of PbSe NCs in a P3HT matrix, in order to bring more light into the controversial discussion on charge separation in the material system considered.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization of lead chalcogenide nanoparticles
Reactions with systematic variations of parameters have been investigated, in order to study the impact on the resulting NCs and to optimize the synthesis conditions. Different types of Pb and E (S, Se, Te) precursors, as well as stabilizers, and their different concentrations have been used to study their influence. The size and morphology of as-synthesized nanomaterials were characterized by TEM. Here, we present a small selection of TEM images of our samples produced under different conditions (Fig. 1–3). Additional results are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 1(a)–(c) shows the TEM images of as-synthesized PbS, PbSe, and PbTe NCs. The NCs are uniform both in shape and size. The detailed information about each synthesis and product parameters is summarized in Table 1. Different materials, namely PbS, PbSe, and PbTe NCs, can be obtained by the above synthesis route, and it is possible to employ various E precursors like E/ODE, TBPE, and TOPE. In Fig. 1(a), S/ODE was used for PbS NCs, in Fig. 1(b), TBPSe for PbSe, and in Fig. 1(c), TOPTe for PbTe. Additionally, we observed in some cases that the NCs dried on a TEM grid do not only form well-ordered two-dimensional superlattices, but even small facetted colloidal 3D super crystals, indicating a relatively narrow size distribution of the NCs. Fig. 1(d) shows an example for a three-dimensional superlattice of PbSe NCs.

The size control achieved for PbSe NCs is illustrated in Fig. 2. These quasi-spherical NCs were prepared under the same conditions, except for the Se precursor. The NCs synthesized with TBPSe are smaller (8.9 ± 0.3 nm) than NCs synthesized with TOPSe (12.8 ± 0.4 nm), although the growth time was the same. TBPSe is known as more reactive compound compared to TOPSe. After addition of Se, the nucleation occurs much faster in the presence of TBP, consequently, more nuclei appear which consume the Pb and Se monomers. In the case of TOP, the number of nuclei is lower, thus, they can have more material available to grow. Within this work, the diameter of PbSe NCs was tuned in the range of ∼6–15 nm (see Table 1). The presented synthesis method does not only allow controlling the particle size, but also enables the preparation of NCs with different shape. For the preparation of spherical PbSe NCs, using OA and PbO is necessary (Fig. 1(b) and (d)). In Fig. 3, examples for the realization of other shapes of PbSe and PbS NCs are given. The star-shaped PbSe NCs were synthesized using PbAc2 instead of PbO as a Pb precursor (Fig. 3(a)), what is in good agreement with Houtepen's experiments.20 The quasi-cubic PbSe NCs (Fig. 3(b)) appear in the presence of octylamine instead of oleic acid. The elongated PbS NCs (Fig. 3(c)) were synthesized using hexadecylamine as a stabilizer. To summarize, the changes of different parameters of the reaction enable the control over size and shape of as synthesized PbE NCs.
For the synthesis of PbE NCs, the Pb precursor was produced by heating the mixture of Pb precursor (PbO or PbAc2), stabilizer (OA or amine), and ODE under inert conditions until 300 °C. The solution becomes transparent and then slightly dark. To investigate the dark precipitate, an XRD analysis has been carried out. Fig. 4(a) shows the XRD pattern obtained, which reveals the existence of crystalline Pb0 nanoparticles. They form without addition of any reducing agent, most likely due to a disproportionation reaction of Pb2+ ions. Pb0 particles might regulate the monomer supply for the growth of the PbE NCs and, therefore, influence the reaction kinetics.21 After the first observation of a dark precipitate, the solution with the E precursor was injected. The color of the reaction mixture becomes deeply dark immediately, indicating the formation of PbE nanocrystals.

To achieve a better understanding of the whole system, the PbSe NCs synthesized as described in the Experimental section have been investigated by XRD as well. As-produced PbSe NCs were analyzed after removal of the Pb0 particles from the solution. A TEM image of PbSe NCs with 6.0 ± 0.4 nm diameter is given in Fig. 5(b), revealing the formation of spherically shaped NCs with a narrow size distribution. Fig. 4(b) shows the corresponding XRD pattern, confirming the successful formation of PbSe. The reflections are broadened, indicating a nanocrystalline material. The mean diameter of the NCs calculated from the width of the XRD reflections by means of the Scherrer equation with K = 1 is 6.1 nm. The elemental composition was determined by EDX measurements. The ratio of Pb to Se is 1.5:1, although the particles were prepared with an initial Pb/Se molar ratio of 1:1. We estimated the fraction of surface Pb and Se atoms by calculating the overall number of surface atoms from the size of the nanoparticles and the lattice parameters of PbSe. Then, taking into account the results of the EDX measurements and assuming a stoichiometric nanocrystal core surrounded by a non-stoichiometric outer layer, the fraction of surface Pb and Se atoms was calculated. The calculations yielded a Pb-rich surface with ∼80% Pb and ∼20% Se at the NC surface. Our results are consistent with experiments on PbSe by Moreels et al.,3 who demonstrated the presence of a stoichiometric PbSe core and a Pb-terminated surface shell.
 Fig. 5  TGA data (a) obtained for original (curve 1) and hexylamine-treated (curve 2) PbSe NCs. Also shown are TEM images of PbSe NCs before (b) and after (c) hexylamine-treatment. 
To investigate also the organic molecules at the surface of the PbSe NCs, the NMR, MS and TGA measurements were carried out. Interestingly, the NMR spectra (see ESI†, Fig. S1) did not show a sign for the presence of OA on the PbSe surface, although the NCs are stable in colloidal solution. We suppose that the absence of OA as a ligand on the particles might be caused by the mechanism of the reaction. At high temperature, the metallic Pb0 particles appear due to the disproportionation of Pb2+ into Pb0 and Pb4+. Thus, the hard oxidation agent Pb(OA)4 is likely to react with the oleic acid on the double bound and functional group. So, under our reaction conditions, the OA probably transforms into other organic compounds. The question arises of course, which ligand molecules stabilize the particles in colloidal solution, if not OA. Here, mass spectrometry of the PbSe NCs provided an answer, because the spectra revealed the presence of dioctylphosphine (see Fig. 6). This compound obviously originates from the use of TOPSe as the precursor and can act as a stabilizer for the final product. Additionally, TGA of the corresponding sample confirms that there is an organic shell of strongly binding ligands, because there is a weight loss starting at ∼250 °C and extending to rather high temperatures near 450 °C (Fig. 5(a)). So, the PbSe NCs have a ligand shell consisting mostly of dioctylphosphine and not oleic acid as it could be expected. However, a very small amount of oleic acid or also decomposition products of OA on the surface cannot be excluded. This study shows that it is not always sufficient to assume that the ligands used as starting materials in the synthesis will also be present on the surface at the end.

The same NCs were treated with hexylamine, in order to study the charge transfer in blends of PbSe NCs and P3HT. The TEM image of hexylamine-treated PbSe NCs is shown in Fig. 5(c), where one clearly recognizes the agglomeration tendency compared to original NCs (Fig. 5(b)). Additionally, the NMR and MS spectra confirm the presence of hexylamine on the surface (see ESI†, Fig. S2). The TGA measurements demonstrate a clear difference between the ligand shell of the original NCs and the one obtained after treatment with hexylamine (Fig. 5(a)). In the case of the hexylamine-treated PbSe particles, the weight loss appears in the range of 100–200 °C, what is in good agreement with the boiling point of hexylamine (132 °C). We estimated the surface coverage by organic ligands for the hexylamine-treated NCs, using the method described in more detail in ref. 11 and 22. Comparison of the overall amount of surface atoms (Pb and Se) with the number of hexylamine per NC yields a surface coverage of ∼90%. The latter is comparable with butylamine-treated CdSe NCs.12 In summary, our treatment (of only 30 minutes duration) appears to be a suitable way to obtain PbSe NCs with a high degree of passivation of surface atoms. In contrast to OA-capped CdSe,12 direct ligand exchange from the original ligand shell to alkylamines is possible here, without the necessity to use an exchange with pyridine as an intermediate step.12 The difference with respect to the CdSe system is probably related to the finding that the initial ligand shell does not consist of intact OA molecules in the case of our PbSe nanocrystals.
2.2. Study of charge transfer in blends of PbSe nanocrystals and P3HT
To characterize the photophysical properties of the hexylamine-treated PbSe particles (Fig. 5(c)) in a poly-(3-hexylthiophene) matrix, the samples were investigated by light induced electron spin resonance (l-ESR) and photo-induced absorption spectroscopy (PIA). Thin films prepared by drop casting out of a 1:1 (wt:wt) blend of P3HT:PbSe in chlorobenzene were used in these studies.
So far, the existence of photo-generated charges in such blends was questionable.13 A first hint for a working charge transfer gives Fig. 7(a), where the photoluminescence (PL) of a pure P3HT film and a P3HT:PbSe blend film is presented. Obviously, a quenching of the PL signal occurs when the PbSe nanoparticles are present. This quenching is not as pronounced as usually in the case of P3HT:fullerene samples, but comparable to other hybrid systems like P3HT:CdSe.10 Note that the addition of pure hexylamine to P3HT lowers the PL intensity only marginally, so that a charge transfer in the P3HT:PbSe system is likely.

For a further proof, a PIA spectrum taken at 80 K is presented in Fig. 7(b). The main signal at 1.1 eV originates from triplet–triplet excitations in P3HT.23 Alternatively, it was assigned to interchain singlet excitons in pure P3HT.24 Additionally, pronounced features at 0.4 eV and 1.25 eV occur. According to previous experiments, these peaks correspond to polaron states in the P3HT phase.24 This demonstrates the existence of photoexcited polarons in hybrid blends of P3HT and hexylamine-treated PbSe nanoparticles, however, the ratio between the peak at 1.1 eV and the polaron peaks suggests that large domains of pure P3HT are present. That can be explained by the not optimized intermixing of polymer and nanoparticles as well as by the comparably low amount of PbSe in the film investigated. Note that in typical active layers for hybrid photovoltaics, ten times more particles are used. The signal intensity of the polaron peaks is smaller but in the same order of magnitude as in P3HT:CdSe blends, a system which is commonly used in hybrid photovoltaics as reference.10,25
To validate the origin of the peak at 1.25 eV the PIA signal's lifetimes were determined by frequency dependent measurements. As demonstrated in Fig. 8(a) the peak intensity of the feature at 1.1 eV shows no dependence on the laser excitation frequency. This is a sign for a recombination process occurring in timescales much below the time resolution of the experiment. On the other hand the peak at 1.25 eV shows a clear dependence on the excitation frequency which appears comparable to former measurements performed on P3HT:fullerene blends.10 In blends of P3HT and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), a bimolecular recombination behavior was observed with a polaron lifetime of ∼1 ms.10 In the P3HT:PbSe sample the bimolecular recombination model also gives a reasonable fit for the experimental results as can be seen in Fig. 8(b) (For more details on the bimolecular recombination model, see ref. 10). The polaron lifetime deduced from this fit lies with ∼100 μs one order of magnitude below that of the pure organic system. This result appears, however, not totally reliable since, especially at high frequencies, the bimolecular fit deviates clearly. We contribute this deviation to multiple recombination processes in complex hybrid material blends.12 As a rough estimation for the polaron lifetime without detailed knowledge of the recombination processes also the intersection between the constant regime and the frequency dependent regime can be taken.26 This gives us an upper limit for the polaron lifetime of roughly 4.5 ms which is close to the above-mentioned value of ∼1 ms of the P3HT:PCBM system.
 Fig. 8  (a) Comparison of the laser modulation frequency dependence of the PIA signals at 1.1 eV (triangles) and 1.25 eV (squares). (b) Lifetime determination of the PIA signal at 1.25 eV. The dashed curve shows a fit corresponding to a bimolecular recombination model. The solid lines show a rough approximation according to which the behavior consists of a constant regime and a frequency dependent regime. 
So, polarons with lifetimes comparable to organic polymer–fullerene blends were successfully generated in the P3HT:PbSe blend, although the system was not even optimized with respect to the film preparation parameters, e.g. mixing ratios. A possible explanation why in the present work, in contrast to ref. 13, charge generation is observed, might be the higher pump laser energy which can be used in our setup. Moreover, our experiment was performed at low temperatures, which increases the charge carrier lifetime and, thus, enhances the sensitivity of the experiment. Another reason could also be the different surface chemistry. In our study we used hexylamine, whereas ligand exchange with butylamine was done in ref. 13. Recently, it was shown that the choice of the ligands can have an impact on the ionization potential of colloidal nanocrystals.27 This will in turn be important for the relative position with respect to the HOMO level of the donor. On the other hand, the differences for butylamine or hexylamine as ligands should be rather small.
To underline the previously gained insights into the charge carrier generation in P3HT:PbSe blends a complimentary technique for charge carrier characterization is used, namely, light induced electron spin resonance spectroscopy, which was performed at low temperature. Here, the observed spectra are qualitatively similar to those of the well investigated P3HT:CdSe system.10–12,25Fig. 9(a) shows the l-ESR spectrum of P3HT:PbSe. A pronounced peak related to the polaron signal in P3HT is visible already without light excitation. Upon laser excitation, the signal increases and, after the laser excitation, relaxes back to a level between the dark and the excited spectra. The details are shown in Fig. 9(b) and (c), where the maximum of the ESR signal is mapped over time. Our findings correspond to the results obtained in P3HT:CdSe systems,10 where the large dark signal was interpreted as deep trap states which cannot be depleted with an annealing step at 100 °C. In the recombination regime after the excitation, polarons as well as charges from shallow traps recombine, while some intermediate traps do not release charges at 80 K.

Dashed line: sample after 5 min with laser excitation (λLaser = 532 nm with PLaser = 20 mW). Dotted line: 5 min after ending the laser excitation; (b) time dependence of the polaron spin resonance signal under illumination (laser excitation started at 0 s); and (c) decay dynamics of the same signal. Laser excitation ended at 0 s. 
Both, l-ESR and PIA studies suggest that a light induced charge transfer occurs at the interface of P3HT and hexylamine-treated PbSe NCs. It is noteworthy in this place that l-ESR provided evidence for charge separation, even when blending PbSe NCs surrounded by the original ligand shell with P3HT. This is another indication that the initial ligand shell does not consist of intact OA molecules, because such a compact ligand shell would be expected to be detrimental for charge transfer. Dioctylphosphine, which was instead found to be the main ligand, is also a relatively long and bulky molecule, so that it also does not appear very suitable in view of charge transfer. On the other hand, the TGA data suggest that the total amount of ligands is not very large for the original NCs (see Fig. 5a). The relative weight loss is even less than after ligand exchange with hexylamine. This suggests that the initial ligand shell consists of long and bulky molecules, but that the degree of surface coverage is comparably low. Therefore, charge transfer can become possible again. In fact, the low degree of surface coverage might be due to a preference of the dioctylphosphine ligands to bind to surface Se sites which are the minority of both types of surface sites. However, a clear proof for such a binding preference would be beyond the scope of this work.
In comparison to the CdSe NCs:P3HT system, the signal intensities observed in our photophysical measurements, meaning the number of charge carriers, are smaller in both measurements for PbSe NCs. Here, we have to mention that several influencing factors present in the latter system have not been investigated and optimized, yet. Especially, the morphology of the bulk heterojunction layer, which was not considered here as well as a not optimized polymer-to-nanoparticle ratio, may lead to a lower charge generation efficiency. With the help of further blend optimization, e.g., a higher particle concentration, it is expected that the efficiency of charge separation in P3HT:PbSe blends can be improved to compete with other hybrid blends for photovoltaics.

Lead(II) oxide yellow (PbO, puriss. p.a., ≥99.0% kT), tellurium powder (Te, purum p.a.), hexylamine (purum, ≥98% (GC)), octylamine (purum, ≥98% (GC)), and tridodecylamine (techn, ∼85% (GC)) were purchased from Fluka; oleic acid (OA, tech., 90%), tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP, 90%), tributylphosphine (TBP), chloroform-d (CDCl3, 99.8 atom% D (containing 0.1% (v/v) tetramethylsilane (TMS))), and sulphur (S, puriss.) were delivered from Aldrich; selenium powder (Se, 99.99%) was purchased from ChemPur; 1-octadecene (ODE) was ordered from Merck; regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) was obtained from Rieke Metals; dodecylamine (98%) was delivered from Acros Organics. All chemicals were used without further purification.
3.2. Synthesis of PbE NCs
A method previously reported for CdE NCs11,21 was taken as a basis and transferred to the synthesis of PbE NCs in the present work. A typical procedure of a PbSe synthesis uses two precursor solutions prepared separately. First, the Se precursor solution (1 M) was obtained under a nitrogen atmosphere in a standard glovebox. 0.4 ml of TOP and 0.4 mmol of Se powder were deposited in a separate flask and permanently stirred until selenium was completely dissolved. The preparation of a Pb precursor solution was carried out under inert conditions. 0.4 mmol of PbO and 0.6 mmol of OA were mixed with 10 ml of ODE by permanent stirring and heating to 100 °C under vacuum for 30 minutes until the precursors were completely dissolved. Further on, the system was connected to an argon flow and heated up to 300 °C.
After the first observation of a dark precipitate, a 1 M TOPSe solution was rapidly injected into the reaction mixture under vigorous stirring. This corresponds to a molar ratio of Pb:Se of 1:1. The color of the solution immediately turned to deep black. The reaction temperature was then reduced to 250 °C for the growth of NCs. To stop the reaction, the heating mantle was then removed, and the reaction vessel rapidly cooled to room temperature.
For the sake of cleaning, the sample was centrifugated immediately, in order to separate the nanocrystal solution from the precipitate. Then the dark solution was mixed with a hexane–methanol blend, containing 3 ml of hexane and 7 ml of methanol, and then centrifugated again. The colored nanoparticle phase was separated and mixed with excess acetone to precipitate the nanocrystal products. The NCs were isolated through centrifugation. Afterwards, the precipitated NCs were dissolved in a small amount of hexane and precipitated again with excess acetone several times for further cleaning. The final product could be dissolved in the solvent desired (toluene, chlorobenzene, or hexane).
In the syntheses of other lead chalcogenide NCs, the procedure is similar as described above. The differences consist in the use of other precursors and a variation of their molar ratio. We used lead acetate (PbAc2) instead of PbO; hexadecylamine (HDA)–OA mixture instead of OA; tellurium, selenium, or sulfur powder dissolved in TOP, TBP, or ODE instead of TOPSe. The solutions with ODE were heated to dissolve the powder in the precursor preparation step.
3.3. Hexylamine treatment of original PbSe NCs
PbSe NCs synthesized with an initial molar ratio of Pb/Se = 1:1 and TOPSe as a Se precursor were subjected to ligand exchange with hexylamine, using a procedure which is similar to the one reported previously.13 A typical PbSe ligand exchange is performed by dissolving the washed NCs in excess hexylamine and sonicating them for 30 minutes. Then, the NCs were precipitated with excess ethanol and isolated by centrifugation several times. The NCs were then redissolved in chlorobenzene.
3.4. Characterization

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
We used a Zeiss EM 902A transmission electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. The TEM specimens were prepared by depositing a drop of a hexane solution of NCs on a carbon-coated copper grid and drying at room temperature.


Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). 
The integral stoichiometry was obtained by the EDAX detector integrated into a FEI Quanta 200 3D scanning electron microscope. The samples were prepared by putting a solution of the NCs in hexane onto an Al plate.


Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). 
Powder X-ray diffraction was measured with a PANalytical X'Pert PRO MPD diffractometer operating with Cu Kα radiation, Bragg-Brentano θ–2θ geometry, a goniometer radius of 240 mm, and variable slits. The samples were prepared by dropping colloidal solution on low-background silicon substrates.


Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 
The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 500 NMR spectrometer operating at 500 MHz. NMR analyses were carried out by dissolving the NCs in CDCl3. The spectra were referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) at δH 0.0.


Mass spectrometry (MS). 
The MS spectra were recorded on a Finnigan MAT 95 instrument with electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV.


Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). 
The measurement was performed under an Ar atmosphere on a Simultane TG-DTA/DSC Apparatur (STA 449 F3 Jupiter) from NETZSCH, using a heating rate of 2.5 °C min−1 up to a temperature of 600 °C.


Solution preparation for photophysical measurements. 
Hexylamine treated nanoparticles were dissolved in chlorobenzene to achieve a solution with a concentration of 0.2 wt%. All following preparation steps were performed in a nitrogen atmosphere. P3HT was dissolved in chlorobenzene to achieve a solution with a concentration of 0.2 wt%. 200 μl of each solutions were blended in a 1:1 volume ratio and stirred overnight (referred to as P3HT:PbSe-HA). For the hexylamine reference sample (referred to as P3HT:HA) 300 μl of the P3HT solution was blended with 20 μl hexylamine.


Photo-induced absorption (PIA) and photoluminescence spectroscopy. 
Each solution (40 μl of P3HT:PbSe-HA, 20 μl of P3HT respectively P3HT:HA) was drop casted on a sapphire substrate, dried, and annealed at 140 °C. The sample was then positioned within a homebuilt l-N2 flow cryostat, pumped down to high vacuum conditions and cooled to 80 K. The complete setup and PIA measurement procedures are described elsewhere.28 The laser excitation wavelength was 532 nm, and the laser power was adjusted to 20 mW by neutral density filters. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded in the same setup with 20 mW laser power at 532 nm excitation wavelength.


Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. 
The spectra were taken with a Bruker Elexys 500 X-band spectrometer at 9.44 GHz. Low temperatures are accessible via an Oxford ESR 900 L-He flow cryostat. For light excitation, a solid-state semiconductor laser with 532 nm wavelength and 20 mW output power was used. 60 μl of P3HT:PbSe-HA was drop casted in a N2 atmosphere onto Mitsubishi Hostaphan Plastic sheets and subsequently annealed to 140 °C. The sliced plastic substrates were introduced into ESR quartz test tubes and sealed under vacuum conditions. Prior to each experiment series, the quartz tube samples were annealed at 100 °C, in order to recombine trapped charges. After each series, it was checked if the processes in the sample are reversible by annealing.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have introduced a novel colloidal synthesis of nearly monodisperse PbE NCs involving in situ formed Pb0 particles. Control over the particle size and shape has been achieved through the variation of parameters, like the choice of the type of precursors and their concentration. The mechanism of the synthesis as well as the surface properties were investigated in more detail for PbSe. As an important finding, oleic acid molecules used in the synthesis as a stabilizer were finally not detected on the surface of the nanocrystals. They seem to decompose during the synthesis. Instead, a phosphorus compound forming during the reaction and originating from the Se precursor passivates the surface. Nevertheless, the particles are stable in colloidal solution, and all TEM images show well separated NCs. Next, a ligand exchange with hexylamine was applied, and its success was verified by NMR and TGA. Towards the application of the PbSe nanocrystals in hybrid photovoltaics, we examined the charge transfer process between P3HT and PbSe. Our l-ESR and PIA studies of PbSe NCs–P3HT blends suggest that separated charges are successfully produced by photoinduced charge transfer. This makes the NCs promising candidates for using them as an electron acceptor component in the active layer in hybrid solar cells.
