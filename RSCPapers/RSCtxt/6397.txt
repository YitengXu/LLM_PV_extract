    , Accepted 8th August 2022First published on 8th August 2022AbstractConducting polymers with stability, flexibility and transparency are highly desired as the crucial component of multifunctional wearable electronic devices due to the growing requirements but suffer from poor electrical characteristics. In this work, carbon nanohorns (CNHs) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were employed to modulate the electrical performances of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) samples. Combining a Ga-doped ZnO microwire (ZnO:Ga MW), the treated PEDOT:PSS sample was used to fabricate an inorganic–organic heterojunction photodetector. The device exhibited excellent photoresponse properties, containing a rectification ratio of 105, a responsivity of 0.273 A W−1, a specific detectivity of 1.17 × 1012 Jones and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of about 91.5% under 370 nm light illumination in a self-driving operation manner. Compared with the detector that uses untreated PEDOT:PSS, the performance features of the rectification ratio, photoresponsivity, specific detectivity and EQE have been distinctly increased over 9.0, 10.9, 9.1 and 10.9 times, respectively. In particular, the response times were greatly reduced from 1.53/16.9 ms to 152 μs/13.5 ms. The enhanced photoresponse characteristics were ascribed to the increased photoelectrical properties of the treated PEDOT:PSS via the CNHs&DMSO co-additive. The electrical conductivity of the DMSO treated PEDOT:PSS was remarkably increased, thus leading to an enhanced rectification ratio of the fabricated n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS heterojunction while the improved photoresponse performances mainly originated from the incorporated CNHs, supplying a high-efficiency transport channel for the photogenerated electron–holes. This work can provide a potential candidate for developing high-performance flexible optoelectronic devices.
1 Introduction
Conducting polymers have attracted tremendous attention for their potential applications in photodetectors, solar cells, organic light emitting diodes, flexible optoelectronic devices and so on.1–7 Compared with inorganic materials, conducting polymers demonstrate significant advantages of light-weight, low-temperature processing, low-cost fabrication, excellent electrical performances and mechanical flexibility, providing potential applications in power-efficient, miniaturized, integrated and wearable optoelectronic devices.8–13 Currently, a large number of conducting polymers (like polypyrrole, polyaniline, poly(3-hexylthiophene), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), etc.) are being investigated to develop flexible optoelectronic devices.8,14–17 Due to the excellent conductivity, high hole affinity, chemically stability and optical properties, the PEDOT:PSS polymer has been treated as a desired candidate to fabricate organic light emitting devices, photodetectors, biosensors, etc.18–21 However, there are still great challenges that need to be resolved for the commercial applications, including inadequate conductivity, reliability issues and lower carrier mobility, which would lead to high power wastage and low operational speed.19,22,23
Recently, various methods have been used to modulate the electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS samples, like rapid thermal annealing, structure engineering, post treatment using acids, etc.24–28 For example, Yong et al. employed a PEDOT:PSS film as the electrode to prepare solar cells. By introducing thermal post-treatment on the PEDOT:PSS electrode, the power conversion efficiency increased from 2% to 2.54%, and the series resistance decreased from 30.4 to 16.4 ohm cm2.29 Deng et al. fabricated PEDOT:PSS/TiO2 heterojunction fibrous photodetectors through concentrated H2SO4 treatment. The photodetection performances were significantly improved, including a 3000% responsivity enhancement and 50 times photocurrent increment.25 Wang et al. synthesized PEDOT using an oxidative chemical vapor deposition method and applied hydrobromic acid treatment to treat the film. The conductivity reached up to a record-high value of 6259 S cm−1 after the engineering process.28 Considering the complex treatment processes and the cost, polar organic solvent treatment, such as by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), is supposed to be an effective method to modulate the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS samples.22,30,31 Additionally, carbon nanostructures are considered as promising candidates to improve the photoelectrical, thermal and mechanical strength performances of conducting polymers.32–36 Benefitting from low acute toxicities, molecular sieving effects and photo-thermal conversion characteristics, carbon nanohorns (CNHs) have been used as drug carriers, biosensors, catalyst supports and electrodes.37–39 However, searching for appropriate additives, which can be utilized to modulate the electronic and photoelectrical properties of conducting polymers, remains a mighty task to be achieved to develop high-performance, flexible, and wearable optoelectronic devices.
In the present research, we proposed and demonstrated a facile scheme to fabricate a kind of one-dimensional organic–inorganic hybrid heterojunction photodetector, which is made of a single ZnO microwire doped by the Ga-element (ZnO:Ga MW) and a p-type PEDOT:PSS polymer film. For the enhancement of the photodetection performances, the electrical properties of the PEDOT:PSS polymer were increased by adding CNHs and DMSO as co-additives. Photoresponse characteristics of the fabricated n-ZnO:Ga MW/PEDOT:PSS heterojunction were studied under 370 nm illumination in a self-powering operation manner. Compared with the device that uses untreated PEDOT:PSS as a p-type conducting material, the photoresponse performances, including the rectification ratio, responsivity, ultraviolet/visible rejection and specific detectivity, have been greatly increased up to ∼105, 0.273 A W−1, 883 and 1.17 × 1012 Jones, respectively. In particular, the response speed (rising/decaying times ∼152 μs/13.5 ms) was obtained from a CNHs&DMSO treated detector, which is much faster than that of the untreated detector (∼1.53/16.9 ms). The influences of CNHs and DMSO on the photodetection performances were investigated respectively. That is, using DMSO treatment, the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS polymer was significantly improved, thus resulting in an enhanced rectification ratio of the fabricated single wire based heterojunction. Meanwhile, the incorporated CNHs could enhance the carrier mobility of the PEDOT:PSS film, thus providing a high-efficiency carrier transport channel for the photogenerated electron–holes in the fabricated n-ZnO:Ga MW/PEDOT:PSS heterojunction detector. This study offers an alternative candidate to improve the electrical performances of PEDOT:PSS samples, as well as a facile approach to fabricate high-performance flexible optoelectronic devices.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Sample preparation
The CNHs powder (20 mg) was added in DMSO organic solution (2 mL), and then ultrasonic dispersion for 10 min. Next, different amounts of CNHs&DMSO colloidal solution (5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 μL) was added into PEDOT:PSS colloidal solution (1 mL), respectively. Thus, the PEDOT:PSS polymers treated by CNHs&DMSO with different treating concentrations were prepared successfully.
2.2 Device fabrication
The individual ZnO:Ga samples were prepared using a simple chemical vapor deposition (CVD).40,41 The photodetection device, which was composed of a single ZnO:Ga MW and PEDOT:PSS film, was fabricated. And the device fabrication procedure is as follows: (1) an individual ZnO:Ga wire was immersed in the PEDOT:PSS colloidal solution for about 3 h, and then dried in a vacuum drying oven for 1 h at 50 °C; (2) the used polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films were cleaned through trichloro ethylene, ethyl alcohol and ultrapure water for 20 min, respectively. And the cleaned PET films were dried for 1 h in a vacuum drying oven; (3) a PET film was treated by a plasma cleaner to increase its wettability and remove organic contaminants; (4) a single ZnO:Ga MW covered by PEDOT:PSS film was mechanically transferred onto the PET substrate, and then fixed the end of the bare wire using an In particle, in which the In particle was functioned as negative electrode; (5) the PEDOT:PSS solution was deposited on the other end of the PEDOT:PSS covered ZnO:Ga MW. The deposited PEDOT:PSS solution will turn into a film, which was used to fix the MW on the PET substrate; and (6) Ag paste serving as the positive electrode was deposited on the PEDOT:PSS film.42,43 Besides, a schematic diagram of the device fabrication is further illustrated in Fig. S7 in the ESI.† By tuning the treating volume of CNHs&DMSO colloidal solution mixed into PEDOT:PSS, the fabricated n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS organic–inorganic heterojunction detectors were donated as Device-1 (0 μL), Device-2 (5 μL), Device-3 (10 μL), Device-4 (20 μL), Device-5 (30 μL) and Device-6 (40 μL), respectively.
2.3 Analysis methods
The structures and surface morphological features of the CVD-synthesized ZnO:Ga MWs, PEDOT:PSS film and n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS hybrid structure were characterized using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surface morphological and the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS films were characterized using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The morphological characteristics of CNHs were examined by a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi TEM system). The crystal structure of ZnO:Ga MW was tested using X-ray diffraction (XRD), with the Cu-Kα1 radiation source (λ = 1.540598 Å). The element distribution of an individual ZnO:Ga wire was measured using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Optical characteristics of CNHs, PEDOT:PSS films untreated and treated by CNHs&DMSO were measured by Raman spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry (Shimadzu 3600 plus). The electrical properties and photoresponse performances of the heterojunction device were characterized using a detecting system composed of a Xe lamp, a monochromator and a Keysight semiconductor device analyzer (Keithley, B1500A). The response times of the detector were measured using a testing system, containing a pulse laser of 370 nm and an oscilloscope.
3 Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) reveals a typical TEM image of the CNHs, showing that the CNH polymerides are assembled from thousands of individual CNHs. The size of the polymeride is examined to about 80 nm.37,38 The optical properties of the prepared CNHs, the PEDOT:PSS sample untreated and treated by CNHs&DMSO, were studied. The transmittance spectra are plotted in Fig. 1(b). It is clearly illustrated that the introduction of CNHs&DMSO has negligible influence on the transmittance of the prepared PEDOT:PSS samples. The transmittances are measured to about 75% in the UV-Vis region. Besides, the as-synthesized CNH sample exhibits little absorbability in the optical wavelengths. The bond vibration modes of the CNHs, the PEDOT:PSS untreated and treated by CNHs&DMSO, were investigated using Raman spectroscopy (the laser wavelength is 532 nm). The Raman spectra of CNHs, the PEDOT:PSS untreated and treated by CNHs&DMSO, and the glass substrate are displayed in Fig. 1(c). The Raman spectrum of CNHs (the violet line) exhibits two dominant peaks. The 1331 cm−1 peak matches the D-band of CNHs, which reflects the defect density and can be applied to monitor the functionalization process of the transformation from sp2 to sp3 states. Meanwhile, the other peak positioning at around 1584 cm−1 is assigned to the oscillation of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in a two-dimension hexagonal lattice.37,38 The much weaker Raman peak at 1095 cm−1 could be derived from the glass substrate. The Raman spectrum of the untreated PEDOT:PSS film (the red line) displayed two peaks. The wavenumber at 1435 cm−1 represents the symmetric CαCβ stretching of the PEDOT, while the peak wavenumber at 1578 cm−1 suggests the vibration modes of PSS.42,43 As the concentration of CNHs treated in PEDOT:PSS lower than a certain value, the Raman result of CNHs in the treated PEDOT:PSS samples is nearly undetectable (the blue line).

The modulation of the incorporated DMSO on the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS sample was studied. The PEDOT:PSS colloidal solutions treated by DMSO with different volumes were prepared. A microribbon-like PEDOT:PSS device using Ag pastes working as the symmetrical electrodes was constructed. The schematic diagram of the fabricated single microribbon-like device is demonstrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†), where x and y were measured under an optical microscope and z was obtained by AFM results.44 A typical bar sample composed of untreated PEDOT:PSS was characterized. The surface morphology of the PEDOT:PSS film was tested by SEM. As illustrated in Fig. S2(a) (ESI†), the film displays a flat surface. AFM was used to characterize the surface morphological and thickness of the PEDOT:PSS film. Fig. S2(b) (ESI†) illustrates the AFM image of the boundary between PEDOT:PSS and the PET substrate. The corresponding height profile is shown in Fig. S2(c) (ESI†). A flat surface of the film with the thickness of about 1.28 μm is observed.45 All the measured x, y and z values of the PEDOT:PSS samples treated with different volumes are exhibited in Table S1 (ESI†). The electrical properties of the fabricated devices were tested at room temperature. The I–V curves shown in Fig. S3(a–f) (ESI†) reveal that increasing the DMSO volumes in the treated PEDOT:PSS colloidal solutions will result in an enormous increment of the conductivities. Besides, the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS samples could be calculated using the following equation: (1)In the formula, σ is the conductivity of the sample, G is the conductance; x, y and z are the sizes of the microribbon-like PEDOT:PSS film along different axial dimensions while dI/dV can be calculated from the plotted I–V curves. According to the formula, the room temperature conductivities of the PEDOT:PSS samples with different treating concentrations of DMSO are evaluated, and depicted in Fig. 1(d). Obviously, increasing the DMSO volume in the PEDOT:PSS colloidal solution can realize tunable p-type conduction. When the introduced DMSO volume reaches 40 μL, the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film is increased up to 10394 S m−1, which is about 190-fold larger than that of untreated sample.
The surface morphological characteristics of PEDOT:PSS films without and with DMSO treatment were tested using an AFM. Fig. S4(a) (ESI†) displays the AFM topography image of the PEDOT:PSS film without DMSO treatment. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the film is derived to about 5.03 nm, which is observably smaller than that of the PEDOT:PSS sample being treated by DMSO (RMS ∼ 6.07 nm, Fig. S4(b), ESI†). Due to the intermolecular interactions between sulfonic acid groups in PSS and DMSO, the PSS insulating layer will be removed, and the huge PEDOT chains are exposed to the surface of the PEDOT:PSS film, which can enhance the surface roughness of the film. Besides, the removal of the PSS insulating layer can significantly enhance the conductivity of the treated film.29,31,46 Moreover, the electrical properties of microribbon-like PEDOT:PSS devices were checked, in which the PEDOT:PSS samples were treated by CNHs&DMSO (volume ∼40 μL). The conductivity is derived to about 10961 S m−1. Thereby, there is little influence of CNHs on the conductivity of the modulated PEDOT:PSS samples. Additionally, bending-stability of the microribbon-like PEDOT:PSS samples were tested. As shown in Fig. 1(e), all the samples demonstrate good bending-stability. And the conductivities of untreated PEDOT:PSS sample, the PEDOT:PSS sample treated by DMSO, and PEDOT:PSS sample treated by CNHs&DMSO can be maintained at the levels of about 92%, 93% and 93%, respectively. Therefore, PEDOT:PSS conducting polymers with excellent electrical conductivities, transparency and mechanical flexibility were successfully prepared.
The sample of individual ZnO:Ga wires have been prepared using a simple CVD method.40,41 The optical image of the as-fabricated ZnO:Ga samples is exhibited in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Ultralong ZnO:Ga MWs have been acquired, and the length can reach up to 2.0 cm, as exhibited in the inset of Fig. S5 (ESI†). The typical SEM photograph of the sample is illustrated in Fig. 2(a). The as-fabricated individual ZnO:Ga MW possesses hexagonal cross-sectional and smooth surfaces. The elemental mapping of a single ZnO:Ga wire was determined via EDS measurement. The elements of Zn, Ga and O are uniformly distributed throughout the entire wire (see Fig. 2(b)). The crystal structure of the corresponding sample was characterized using XRD measurement. As shown in Fig. 2(c), four different diffraction peak signals centered at 31.63°, 34.31°, 36.09° and 47.44° can be collected, which originate from (100), (002), (101) and (102) planes, respectively. The XRD result demonstrates that the sample possesses a hexagonal wurtzite structure with good crystalline quality. Furthermore, the lattice constants a and c of the sample can be calculated using the following formulas: 2d(hkl)sinθ = kλ.(2) (3)The interplanar spacings of (100) and (002) are calculated to be 0.283 and 0.261 nm, respectively. As a consequence, the lattice constants a and c are evaluated to about 0.326 and 0.522 nm, conforming well with the wurtzite P63mc space.47,48 The optical characteristics of an individual ZnO:Ga MW were further characterized using a 325 nm He–Cd laser. As shown in Fig. S6(a) (ESI†), the single ZnO:Ga MW displays two emission peaks. The dominant ultraviolet emission peak at 378 nm represents the typical near-band-edge (NBE) emission, which originates from the bound exciton recombination. Meanwhile, the weak emission at visible region may be induced by the Ga-doping induced impurity-related levels or the defects.49,50 The absorbance spectrum with normalized intensity of an individual ZnO:Ga MW is illustrated in Fig. S6(b) (ESI†). The ZnO:Ga MW displays a cut-off absorbance edge at about 400 nm, which is induced by the NBE absorbance of the sample.42,51

As described in the Experimental section, a kind of one-dimensional wire-like photodetector made of an individual ZnO:Ga MW and PEDOT:PSS film, was prepared. Schematic diagram of the as-fabricated n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS photodetector is presented in Fig. 2(d). In the device structure, Ag paste and In particle are applied as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The optical images of the single MW device are displayed in Fig. S8(a) (ESI†). The critical region of the wire uncovered and covered by a PEDOT:PSS film was characterized using a SEM, as shown in Fig. S8(b) (ESI†). The PEDOT:PSS film covers the surfaces of the ZnO:Ga sample uniformly and tightly. The electrical characteristics of the fabricated n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS organic–inorganic heterojunction devices were measured. Taking a Device-1 for example, the I–V curves in the dark is displayed in Fig. S9(a) (ESI†), reflecting typical rectifying characteristics. The linear I–V curves for In on ZnO:Ga MW (see Fig. S9(b) in the ESI†) and Ag on PEDOT:PSS (see Fig. S9(c) in the ESI†) indicate that good Ohmic contacting behaviors have been formed. Therefore, we can conclude that the good rectifying characteristics are assigned to the high quality p–n heterojunction between p-PEDOT:PSS and n-ZnO:Ga MW.41,50
Photoresponse performances of the fabricated devices were tested. The logarithmic I–V curves of Device-1 in darkness and irradiated under different light wavelengths are plotted in Fig. S10 in the ESI.† It is deduced that the device achieves the maximum photoresponse at 370 nm in the UV band. Fig. 2(e) illustrated the I–V characteristics of Device-1 and Device-4 in the dark and under 370 nm irradiation (light power density of 2.5 mW cm−2). The I–V curves of Device-2, Device-3, Device-5 and Device-6 are further illustrated in Fig. S11 in the ESI.† All devices exhibit good rectifying characteristics in the dark and distinguished photoresponse under 370 nm light irradiation. Interestingly, the photocurrents observed in all the devices exhibit a noticeable increase by varying the treating concentration of CNHs&DMSO in the PEDOT:PSS samples in the range of 5–40 μL. Accordingly, the dark current at −4 V also demonstrates a significant increase in their intensity. To assess the influence of the incorporated CNHs&DMSO on photoresponse performances of the fabricated devices, the rectification ratio (I+3V/I−3V) and the photocurrent to dark current (Iph/Id) ratio at 0 V were investigated.44 As presented in Fig. 2(f), the rectification ratio and Iph/Id ratio reveal significant enhancement by incorporating the CNHs&DMSO into PEDOT:PSS samples. When the treating volume is in the range of 0 to 20 μL, the rectification ratio and Iph/Id ratio exhibit an increasing trend. The Iph/Id ratio of Device-4 can reach up to 4 × 103 at zero bias, indicating significant ultraviolet photodetection performances of the fabricated n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS junction, which being treated by CNHs&DMSO (the volume ∼20 μL). A rectification ratio of up to ∼105 can be achieved, which is about 10-fold higher than that of Device-1. Unfortunately, due to the rapidly raised dark current, the rectification ratio and Iph/Id ratio values decrease when the treating volume is larger than 20 μL.
To assess the photoresponse properties of the as-prepared n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS heterojunction photodetectors, the parameters of the responsivity (R), specific detectivity (D*) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were investigated. The responsivity of the device can be evaluated via the following function:19,43,52 (4)where P is the light power density, and S is the effective irradiated area. The specific detectivity, representing the ability to collect weak light signals, is defined by the following equation: (5)where e is the electron charge. The EQE of the fabricated device is determined utilizing the following formula: (6)In the equation, h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and λ is the wavelength of illuminated light.

Fig. 3(a) presents the responsivities of Device-1 and Device-4 when operated at various reverse bias voltage. By varying the reverse bias voltage, the responsivity of Device-4 is much higher than that of Device-1. When operated in a self-driving manner, the responsivity of the Device-4 can achieve 0.273 A W−1, which is about 10.9-fold higher than that of Device-1 (∼0.025 A W−1). The enhancement ratio of the responsivity (RDevice-4/RDevice-1) is illustrated in Fig. S12 in the ESI.† In particular, the enhancement ratio reaches the maximum value at 0 V. The specific detectivity of Device-4 is calculated to be 1.17 × 1012 Jones, which is about 9.0 times higher than that of Device-1 (∼1.29 × 1011 Jones) at 0 V. The current–time (I–t) curves of Device-1 and Device-4 were measured under 370 nm illumination with the light power density of 2.5 mW cm−2. As depicted in Fig. 3(b), Device-1 exhibits good reproducibility and stability with the ultraviolet light switch on and off. And the photocurrent of the detector is about 3.2 nA. The obvious fluctuation of the current might induced by the pyro-phototronic effect.53–55 Profit from the introduction of CNHs&DMSO, the photocurrent of Device-4 reaches up to ∼34 nA (see Fig. 3(c)), which increases to over one order of magnitude larger than that of Device-1.42,44 Besides, the on/off ratio of Device-4 can reach up to ∼4022 at zero bias, which is much larger than that of Device-1 (on/off ratio ∼535).

Time-resolved currents of (b) Device-1 and (c) Device-4 with the illuminated light switch on and off. (d) The dependence of responsivities of Device-1 and Device-4 on the incident light wavelengths varying from 300 to 550 nm. (e) I–V characteristics of the CNHs&DMSO treated PEDOT:PSS film in the dark and under 370 nm irradiation with an optical power intensity of ∼2.5 mW cm−2. (f) Schematic diagram of the band structure under ultraviolet light at 0 V. 
The spectral responsivities of Device-1 and Device-4 are plotted in Fig. 3(d) in a self-powered mode. Both the Device-1 and Device-4 possess distinct photodetection properties in the ultraviolet region with the maximum responsivity values centered at 370 nm. Clearly, the maximum responsivity of Device-4 is about one order of magnitude larger than that of Device-1. The ultraviolet/visible rejection ratio (R370/R400) of Device-4 is calculated to be ∼883, which is much larger than that of Device-1 (R370/R400 ∼ 155). The specific detectivities of Device-1 and Device-4 under various illuminating wavelengths is displayed in Fig. S13 (see the ESI†). The specific detectivity of Device-4 achieves the peak value of ∼1.15 × 1012 Jones under 370 nm light irradiation, which is about 7.8-fold higher than that of Device-1 (∼1.48 × 1011 Jones). Conclusively, the modulation of CNHs&DMSO on the electrical conductivities of as-prepared PEDOT:PSS samples can be used to construct high-performance single ZnO:Ga MW organic–inorganic heterojunction photodetection devices.
The photoresponse mechanism of the fabricated n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS heterojunction detector was researched. The I–V characteristics of CNHs&DMSO treated PEDOT:PSS film in the dark and illuminated with various irradiated lights are shown in Fig. 3(e). Obviously, the as-prepared film shows nearly negligible photoresponse in the wavelength range of 300–500 nm. Thus, the PEDOT:PSS sample can only act as a hole transport material in the n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS heterojunction detector. The large band gap of ZnO:Ga MW (3.37 eV) makes it competitive to prepare an ultraviolet photodetector. And the photoresponse wavelength of the detector is matched well with the band gap of ZnO:Ga samples. Therefore, the photo-induced current originated from the ZnO:Ga MW active layer. The band structure of the n-ZnO:Ga/p-PEDOT:PSS heterojunction device in the absence of driven voltage is illustrated in Fig. 3(f). In this case, a typical type-2 band structure is formed around the interface between ZnO:Ga MW and PEDOT:PSS film, which has the advantage for the transportation of photogenerated charge carriers. When the energy of the illuminated photons is higher than the bandgap of ZnO:Ga MW, the electron–hole pairs will be generated. Driven by the built-in electric field, the photo-generated electrons will move to the negative electrode (In particle) from ZnO:Ga MW while the holes will transport along the valence band from the ZnO:Ga MW to the PEDOT:PSS film, and then captured by the positive electrode (Ag paste).42,56
To further evaluate the modulation of CNHs&DMSO on the photodetecting device, the variations in the I–V characteristics of all the devices were performed at 370 nm illumination at different light power intensities ranging from darkness to 2.5 mW cm−2. The logarithmic I–V curves of Device-1 and Device-4 are represented in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. Shown in the figures, the devices display a distinct photoresponse when exposed to the ultraviolet light illumination. And the photocurrents are increased distinctly by increasing the irradiated power density. The I–t results of Device-1 and Device-4 were further observed under various light power intensities at zero bias. The experimental results are shown in Fig. S15(a and b) in the ESI,† respectively. By comparison, the photocurrents achieved in Device-4 under varied light power densities are greatly increased than those of the Device-1. Besides, the logarithmic photocurrents versus light densities curves, representing the generation, trapping and recombination process of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, are plotted in Fig. 4(c). The nonlinear relationship between photocurrent and light power density is evaluated using an ordinary power law: Iph = APθ,(7)where A is a constant to a definite irradiating wavelength, the exponent θ (in the range of 0.5–1.0) represents the generation, trapping and recombination process of a detector. The θ value of Device-4 is derived to be about 0.96, which is much larger than that of Device-1 (θ ∼ 0.85). By incorporating CNHs&DMSO into the as-prepared PEDOT:PSS samples, the device displays better junction character and more effective photoresponse characteristics.57–59

(f) The enhancement ratio of responsivities (the left axis) and specific detectivities (the right axis) of Device-1 and Device-4, respectively. 
The light-intensity-dependent responsivities of Device-1 and Device-4 are exhibited in Fig. 4(d) at zero bias. A maximum responsivity of about 0.28 A W−1 can be obtained in the Device-4. Clearly, the responsivity value is significantly larger than that of the Device-1 (∼0.04 A W−1). Accordingly, the specific detectivity of Device-4 is evaluated to be about 1.23 × 1012 Jones, which is much higher than that of the Device-1 (∼2.11 × 1011 Jones). Moreover, the ratio of RDevice-4/RDevice-1 and  were calculated. As illustrated in Fig. 4(f), the maximum RDevice-4/RDevice-1 is calculated to be 11.0, while the maximum  ratio is 9.2 at the light power intensity of 2.5 mW cm−2 in a self-powered mode.19,57,60 Conclusively, the photoresponse performances of the fabricated n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS heterojunction photodetector can be optimized through the modulation of CNHs&DMSO co-treatment on the electrical properties of the PEDOT:PSS samples.
When operated at zero bias, the time-resolved photoresponses of the detectors were measured using a detecting system, which is composed of an oscilloscope and a pulse laser of 370 nm. Multicycle time-resolved photoresponse of Device-1 is plotted in Fig. S16(a) (ESI†). Device-1 retains excellent stability and repeatability when illuminated under a strong pump laser, identifying with the transient photoresponse performance of Device-4 (see Fig. S16(b), ESI†). Fig. 5(a) illustrates monocyclic transient photoresponse signal of Device-1. The rise time (τrise) is calculated to be ∼1.53 ms, and the decay time (τdecay) is checked to ∼16.9 ms. The fast rise time means its rapid photoresponse performance for ultraviolet light. In comparison, the longer decay may induce by the photoconduction effect of the devices. Surprisingly, the rise/decay times of Device-4 is sharply reduced to ∼152 μs/13.5 ms (shown in Fig. 5(b)).43,44

The influences of CNHs and DMSO on the photoresponse performances of the fabricated devices were further studied severally. The untreated PEDOT:PSS, the PEDOT:PSS sample treated by DMSO, the PEDOT:PSS sample treated by CNHs&DMSO (the volumes are 20 μL) were used to fabricate the ZnO:Ga MW heterojunction photodetectors. The I–t characteristics of the fabricated individual MW heterojunction detectors are shown in Fig. S17(a–c) in the ESI.† The dark currents at ±3 V and the photocurrents at 0 V are summarized in Table 1. By comparing with the device that using untreated PEDOT:PSS as the p-type conducting polymer, the rectification ratios at ±3 V of the fabricated devices are greatly increased.31 In particular, the photocurrent of the photodetector treated using CNHs&DMSO is significantly increased up to 33.7 nA, which is one order of magnitude larger than those devices using untreated PEDOT:PSS and treated only by DMSO (these devices were operated at zero bias).

The dark current in the forward-biased regime can be increased by incorporating DMSO, leading to an increase of the rectification ratio. And the great improvement of rectification ratios for the fabricated devices can be assigned to the enhanced conductivity of PEDOT:PSS film via DMSO treatment. It has been reported that PEDOT:PSS treated by DMSO exhibits lower work function than that of the untreated samples.61 Thus, the built-in potential of the n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS would be reduced by introducing DMSO using the formula eVD = WF(PEDOT:PSS) − WF(ZnO:Ga),(8)where eVD is the built-in potential, WF(PEDOT:PSS) and WF(ZnO:Ga) are the work functions of PEDOT:PSS and ZnO:Ga, respectively. The reduced built-in potential may have a negative effect on the photoresponse performances of the fabricated detectors. Consequently, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS samples can be significantly increased by introducing DMSO treatment, but giving rise to little enhancement of the measured photocurrent in the fabricated n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS organic–inorganic heterojunction photodetectors.
To evaluated the effect of CNHs on the photoresponse properties of the detectors, the electrical characteristics of the used PEDOT:PSS polymer treated by DMSO, and CNHs&DMSO should be determined. Thus, a new generation of organic field effect transistors (OFETs), which was composed of microribbon-like PEDOT:PSS layer, was prepared. In the OFET device, the PEDOT:PSS was treated by DMSO and the CNHs&DMSO co-additive, respectively. Besides, a piece of Si substrate with 300 nm SO2 layer coating was cleaned using trichloro ethylene, ethyl alcohol and ultrapure water, respectively. Next, the PEDOT:PSS film was deposited on the SO2/Si substrates. Ag pastes utilized as the electrodes were fixed the PEDOT:PSS film on the SO2/Si substrate. Fig. 5(c) exhibits the source–drain current (Ids) as a function of source–drain voltage (Vds) of DMSO treated PEDOT:PSS based OFET at various back-gate voltages (Vg). And the Ids–Vg curve of the OFET is illustrated in Fig. 5(d). It clearly illustrated that the OFET device displayed typical p-channel properties. The carrier mobility of DMSO treated PEDOT:PSS film can be evaluated using the following functions:42,66 (9) (10)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the dielectric constant of the SO2 layer (3.9), d is the thickness of the SO2 layer (∼300 nm), cp is the capacitance per unit area, gm is the transconductance of the OFET, which is equal to dIds/dVg, L is the length of the channel, W is the width of the channel, and μ is the carrier mobility. The carrier mobility of DMSO treated PEDOT:PSS film is calculated to be ∼29.3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Similarly, the carrier mobility of CNHs&DMSO co-treated PEDOT:PSS is worked out to be about 45.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (see Fig. 5(e and f)). The detailed parameters of the OFETs are displayed in Table 2. The carrier mobility of the CNHs&DMSO treated PEDOT:PSS film is evidently better than that of the DMSO treated PEDOT:PSS film. That is, a high-efficiency carrier transport channel can be formed by introducing CNHs, thus facilitating the carriers transport of the designed n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS heterojunction photodetectors. Thus, it will result in a larger photocurrent and faster response speed. Because of the synergistic effect of CNHs and DMSO, the photoresponse performances of the fabricated n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS organic–inorganic heterojunction photodetection devices were significantly enhanced.36,38

The bending-stability of the prepared n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS organic–inorganic heterojunction photodetectors were investigated by varying the bending angles and cycles. Taking the Device-4 for instance, Fig. 6(a) illustrates the optical images of the device structure with different bending angles. The time-resolved photoresponses of Device-4 with different bending angles are plotted in Fig. 6(b) (the device is illuminated under 370 nm with the power density of 0.72 mW cm−2). And the corresponding photocurrents are summarized in Fig. 6(c). With increasing the bending angles, the photocurrent stays stable without significant decrease, and the maximum photocurrent can maintain at about 81% at the bending angle of 60°. Thus, the fabricated n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS heterojunction photodetector exhibits good mechanical durability. As illustrated in Fig. 6(d), the Device-4 displays stable photocurrent. Even after 400 bending cycles, the measured photocurrents are still maintained at 83% (see Fig. 6(e)).15,57 The excellent bending-stability can be ascribed to the good mechanical flexibility of PEDOT:PSS films. The long-time stability of the Device-4 without encapsulations is tested and shown in Fig. S19(a) in the ESI.† The device demonstrates good time-resolved stability with little photocurrent reduction even after 8 weeks (see Fig. S19(b), ESI†). The device performances in our work are compared with other PEDOT:PSS based photodetectors in recent reports, as illustrated in Table 3. Obviously, the represented n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS organic–inorganic heterojunction flexible photodetector, in which the used PEDOT:PSS polymers have been treated utilizing CNHs&DMSO co-additive, displays good comprehensive performances. Therefore, the proposed and fabricated n-ZnO:Ga MW/p-PEDOT:PSS organic–inorganic heterojunction photodetector has advantages for commercial applications.

4 Conclusions
In summary, a high-performance and flexible ultraviolet photodetector, which was constructed using an individual ZnO:Ga MW and PEDOT:PSS via CNHs&DMSO co-treatment, was fabricated. The detector can operate in a self-biasing mode, and exhibits high-performance features, including a rectification ratio of ∼105, a responsivity of ∼0.273 A W−1, a specific detectivity ∼1.17 × 1012 Jones, an EQE of ∼91.5%, a fast response time of ∼152 μs/13.5 ms under 370 nm illumination without an external power unit. In addition, the detector exhibits good bending stability and long-time stability. The excellent device properties could be attributed to CNHs&DMSO co-treatment in the as-prepared PEDOT:PSS samples. The conductivity of PEDOT:PSS samples enhanced by incorporating DMSO yields significantly increased forward-biased current and large rectification ratio. The photocurrent can be observably enhanced by further introducing CNH treatment, which would provide a high-efficiency transport channel for the photogenerated electron–holes. This work provides a workable and meaningful approach to modulate the electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS synthetically organic polymers, and developing high-performance organic–inorganic heterojunction flexible optoelectronic devices.
