    , Accepted 27th July 2019First published on 29th July 2019AbstractWe demonstrate in this work that N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is a superior alternative to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an additive in a precursor solution for the fabrication of high-quality perovskite films for solar cells. While the DMSO-assisted method always requires the films to be prepared with a low and restricted PdI2:DMSO ratio, NMP provides a much wider window of the PbI2/NMP ratio for the preparation of high-quality perovskite films. The systematic studies on the structures of intermediates obtained with different PbI2/NMP ratios reveal that only one kind of intermediate forms regardless of the Pb2+/NMP ratio between 1 and 4, which is totally different from the situation of a PbI2/DMSO system. But all the perovskite solar cell devices fabricated with different Pb2+/NMP ratios show similar performances to their counterpart fabricated with 1:1 Pb2+/DMSO. Besides the MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3+) system, NMP is shown to be an excellent coordinative additive for the fabrication of high-quality triple-cation (Cs+/formamidinium/MA) perovskite films.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted enormous attention in the past decade for the boosting of power conversion efficiency (PCE) to the current world record of 23.7%.1–5 The rapid development is mainly attributed to the excellent intrinsic properties of metal halide perovskites and easy formation of their high-quality thin films.6–19 In pursuit of high PCE, diverse methodologies have been developed to synthesize perovskite films.20–23 Among these methodologies, a solvent-engineering technique has been widely adopted due to its easy operation.24
In the solvent-engineering method, solvents and coordinative additives play important roles in controlling the crystallization process of perovskite films and thus their quality. In this method, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is often introduced as a coordinative additive into the precursors dissolved in solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and γ-butyrolactone.25–28 The use of DMSO retards the crystallization of PbI2 in the sequential two-step method by forming amorphous PbI2–DMSO complexes, and thus slows down the reaction rate of PbI2 and MAI (MA = CH3NH3+).29–32 Compared to perovskite films prepared without any additives,33 films prepared with DMSO are of high quality with fewer pinholes. However, it has been reported that, to obtain high-quality films, the PbI2/DMSO ratio in the precursor solution should be restricted to around 1:1.29 In our previous work, we found that excess DMSO (PbI2:DMSO = 1:2) would form another intermediate (PbI2·2DMSO), leading to perovskite films with lower quality and final devices with inferior performance.34 The low PbI2/DMSO ratio thus requires delicate control during the fabrication of perovskite films.
While NMP has been reported to be an alternative additive to DMSO,26 we now demonstrate in this work that NMP is a much better additive than DMSO to offer a much wider window of the PbI2/additive ratio. Similar to DMSO, NMP has a high boiling point and low vapour pressure.35,36 However, NMP is bulkier than DMSO, which would alter the formation of PbI2:additive intermediates. In this work, we find that the obtained perovskite films are always of high quality with a dense and uniform morphology, regardless of the PbI2/NMP ratio in the precursor solution and the deposition method when NMP is used as a coordinative additive. As evidenced by single-crystal analyses and XRD measurements, PbI2·NMP was the sole PbI2:additive intermediate, although a wide range of PbI2/NMP ratios was used. Such a situation is totally different from that when using DMSO as the additive and thus offers a highly reproducible protocol for the fabrication of high-performance PSCs. Moreover, the advantage of using NMP as the additive for the fabrication of high-quality perovskite films is also extendable to the triple-cation perovskite system. All these results demonstrate that NMP is a much better additive than DMSO for the fabrication of high-quality perovskite films.
Results and discussion
In this work, we fabricated perovskite films using the exactly same process with NMP or DMSO as an additive. A sequential two-step method was used to deposit the MAPbI3 perovskite layer (Fig. 1a). First, PbI2 was dissolved in DMF together with NMP or DMSO to form the precursor solution, in which the PbI2/NMP or PbI2/DMSO ratio was 1:1 or 1:2 (described below as PbI2:xNMP and PbI2:xDMSO). The solution was then spin-coated to obtain transparent PbI2 precursor films. Then, an MAI solution in isopropanol (IPA) was added dropwise atop the precursor films. As shown in Fig. 1b and c, the as-cast MAPbI3 films derived from both PbI2:1NMP and PbI2:2NMP consisted of dense and well-defined crystallites of several hundred nanometres and were free of pinholes.

We used ZnO-MgO-EA+ as an electron-transporting layer (ETL),37 MAPbI3 as a light-absorbing layer and spiro-OMeTAD as a hole-transporting layer (HTL) for the fabrication of PSC devices with a configuration of FTO/ZnO-MgO-EA+/mesoporous-TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The corresponding cross-sections of PSC devices based on different PbI2/NMP ratios were characterized by SEM (Fig. 2a and b), showing dense and high-quality MAPbI3 thin films. In comparison, when DMSO was used as the additive, the films showed various morphologies when different ratios of PbI2/DMSO were used (Fig. S1†). Similarly, as shown in our previous work, when PbI2 precursor films were prepared with excess DMSO, large PbI2 crystallites were formed and prevented further reaction between PbI2 and MAI, producing perovskite films with small crystalline domains and lots of pinholes.34 Here, we demonstrate that in the NMP-assisted approach, high-quality MAPbI3 films without pinholes are easily fabricated, regardless of the PbI2/additive ratio. This result indicated that NMP is a superior coordination additive to DMSO.

As expected, the high-quality perovskite films obtained from the PbI2/NMP solution led to an improvement in device performance. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the corresponding devices spanned from the UV region to 800 nm (Fig. S2†), matching well with the UV-vis (Fig. S3†) and steady-state photoluminescence spectra (Fig. S4†) of these perovskite films. The J–V characteristics of these devices were measured under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. As shown in Fig. 2c and d, and Table S1,† the best efficiency of 19.1% was obtained from the solar cells fabricated using PbI2:1NMP with a short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of 23.5 mA cm−2, 1.07 V and 0.76, respectively. Measurements over 30 fabricated cells gave an average efficiency of 18.4 ± 1.0%. On the other hand, the devices based on PbI2:2NMP gave the best efficiency of 19.2%, with an average efficiency of 18.4 ± 1.0%. In comparison, the efficiencies of the devices derived from DMSO as an additive highly depend on the relative ratio of PbI2 and DMSO used in the fabrication. While PbI2:1DMSO showed the best efficiency of 18.0% and an average efficiency of 16.7 ± 1.3%, PbI2:2DMSO showed inferior performance, with the best efficiency of 14.2% and an average efficiency of 13.2 ± 1.0% (Fig. S5†). Overall, PSC devices fabricated with NMP showed advantages over those fabricated with DMSO both in improving the efficiency and enlarging the additive window.
Furthermore, the charge transportation and recombination processes in perovskite thin films varied with different amounts of DMSO and NMP additives, as evidenced by electrical impedance spectroscopy. While the circle with lower frequency of the impedance spectrum is related to the charge recombination rate inside the perovskite films, the circle with higher frequency depends on the charge transportation rate. As suggested by the Nyquist plots of the devices fabricated with different PbI2/NMP and PbI2/DMSO ratios (Fig. S6†), the charge recombination resistances for the devices fabricated with different PbI2/NMP ratios were quite similar. Likewise, as shown in Fig. S7,† the stabilized outputs of the current density as a function of time at the maximum power point remained stable in the cases of PbI2:1NMP, PbI2:2NMP and PbI2:1DMSO, but reduced sharply in the case of PbI2:2DMSO. In sharp contrast to the situation using DMSO, the quality of perovskite films and performance of the corresponding PSC devices were insensitive to the PbI2/NMP ratio, making the fabrication process of high-performance PSCs more stable and reproducible. All these results confirmed that NMP served as a much better additive than DMSO in the fabrication of high-quality perovskite films for high-performance PSCs.
To understand why the quality of perovskite films and performance of the corresponding PSCs were relatively independent of the PbI2/NMP ratios, we investigated the structures of single crystals and films of the intermediates. Single crystals of the precursors were grown by slowly diffusing tetrachloromethane into a solution of PbI2 containing different amounts of NMP. We found that only one kind of crystal could be synthesized regardless of the PbI2/NMP ratio. Single-crystal analysis (Fig. 3a and Table S2†) revealed that the as-obtained yellow crystals were composed of a PbI2·NMP complex with a double-chain structure in which the PbI5O octahedra shared edges and all unshared apexes were stabilized by NMP. This structure was similar to a PbI2·DMSO structure obtained from the PbI2:1DMSO precursor, though excess NMP (molar ratio of PbI2/NMP up to 1:4) was used in the crystallization process. This result was also evidenced by XRD data of the intermediate films. As shown in Fig. 3b, the precursor films showed similar XRD patterns for both PbI2/NMP ratios (1:1 and 1:2), indicating that the precursors have the same structure. More importantly, they matched well with the patterns simulated from the resolved single-crystal structure of a 1:1 PbI2–NMP complex. Such a situation is totally disparate from that of DMSO, in which two kinds of complexes are formed as PbI2·DMSO and PbI2·2DMSO, when the PbI2/DMSO ratios are different (Fig. S8 and S9†). The intermediate phases in both systems were readily transformed into the targeted perovskite phases after MAI treatment and a post-annealing process, and the XRD peak intensity of perovskites was stronger in the case of NMP (Fig. 3c and d and Fig. S9 and 10†), consistent with their larger grain size. Due to the presence of PbI2·2DMSO in the PbI2:2DMSO case, the as-obtained perovskite films contained a lot of pinholes. This in-depth study helps in understanding why NMP can serve as a much better additive than DMSO to broaden the window of the PbI2/additive ratio for the fabrication of high-quality perovskite films.

XRD patterns of PbI2 precursor films and the reaction with MAI before and after annealing (△), with PbI2/NMP molar ratios of (c) 1:1 and (d) 1:2. 
The content of NMP in the PbI2·NMP complex was further confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S11†). The TGA curve revealed a single-step decomposition with a weight loss of 16.6%, matching well with the theoretical value in PbI2·NMP. Similar to PbI2·DMSO, the decomposition temperature of PbI2·NMP was also higher than that of PbI2·DMF. Such a property is beneficial for the formation of high-quality perovskite films by stabilizing an intermediate phase during the spin-coating process. Surprisingly, further increasing the PbI2/NMP ratio to 1:4 also resulted in the formation of a PbI2·NMP complex (Fig. S12†). We deposited perovskite thin films using different PbI2/NMP ratios with the same Pb2+ concentration of 1.3 M. As shown in Fig. S13,† the thickness of perovskite films remained the same with different PbI2/NMP ratios. The performances of PSC devices fabricated with variable PbI2/NMP ratios from 1:1 to 1:4 were almost the same compared to those of devices with no additive which showed inferior efficiencies of 14.4% (Fig. S14†). These results further confirmed the advantage of using NMP as an additive for the fabrication of high-quality MAPbI3 thin films for PSCs.
Besides the MAPbI3 system, NMP readily acts as an excellent additive for the fabrication of high-quality films of other perovskite systems, for example, the tri-cation Cs/FA/MA system (FA = CH3(NH2)2+).38 In the sequential two-step fabrication process, a precursor solution of PbI2/PbBr2/CsI dissolved in DMF and NMP (with PbX2/NMP ratios of 1:1 or 1:2; X = I or Br) was spin-coated on the FTO/ZnO-MgO-EA+/meso-TiO2 substrate. A mixture of FAI and MABr in isopropanol was then slowly added dropwise onto the precursor film. The obtained intermediate film was then heated to induce the formation of perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, both precursors and perovskite films (before and after annealing) prepared with different amounts of NMP showed similar XRD patterns. High-quality perovskite films with large grain domains were produced in both the cases of NMP (Fig. 4c and d). In contrast, in the case of DMSO, the Pb2+/DMSO ratio should be strictly limited to 1:1, as described above. Unlike PbX2:1DMSO, the perovskite films prepared from the PbX2:2DMSO precursor presented a lot of pinholes (Fig. S15†). The J–V characteristics of these devices based on the above perovskite films were measured. As shown in Fig. 4e and Table S1,† the best efficiency of 20.1% was obtained from the solar cells fabricated with PbX2:1NMP. The Jsc, Voc and FF were found to be 24.5 mA cm−2, 1.07 V and 0.77, respectively. The average efficiency among 30 cells was 18.7 ± 1.0% (Fig. 4f). In the case of PbX2:2NMP, the best efficiency was the same at 20.1%, with an average efficiency of 18.8 ± 1.0%. These results further confirmed the advantage of using NMP as a reliable additive for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells, viable in both single-cation and triple-cation perovskites.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated NMP as an excellent additive for controlling the formation of high-quality perovskite films for solar cells. In contrast to protocols involving the use of DMSO as an additive, the quality of perovskite films was insensitive to the PbI2/NMP ratio in the precursor solution. When NMP was used as the coordination solvent to PbI2, both single-crystal and XRD analyses indicated that a single kind of intermediate structure, PbI2·NMP, was formed, regardless of the ratio of PbI2/NMP in the precursor solution. With such an additive, smooth and continuous morphologies of the intermediate films were produced, thus leading to final high-quality perovskite films of MAPbI3 with large grain size. As a result, regardless of the PbI2/NMP ratio (1:1 or 1:2) in the precursor solution, all the devices with MAPbI3 based on the sequential two-step method showed consistent performance, in accordance with the corresponding PSCs fabricated from the PbI2:1DMSO precursor. Furthermore, NMP can be extended to the tri-cation Cs/FA/MA system with a constant trend. These experimental results demonstrated the broad additive window of NMP and its easy fabrication method. Therefore, these findings pave the way for scaling up the device fabrication and finally the commercialization of PSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
PbI2 was purchased from TCI Chemicals; TiO2 paste (18NR-T) from Dyesol; Spiro-OMeTAD from Luminescence Technology Corp; 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) from J&K Scientific Ltd; and zinc acetate, magnesium acetate and all solvents from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. All chemicals were used as received. CH3NH3I was synthesized and purified as reported.39
Preparation of PbI2·NMP crystals
PbI2 was dissolved in NMP and then tetrachloromethane was slowly diffused into the above solution for 24 h to generate yellow grain-like crystals.
Solar cell fabrication
Before the deposition of the ETL, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates were sequentially washed in ultrasonic baths of acetone, distilled water and ethanol. A compact ZnO-MgO-EA+ blocking layer as the ETL was prepared on clean FTO by our previously reported method:37 a solution of zinc acetate dihydrate (0.1 M), magnesium acetate tetrahydrate (0.1 M) and ethanolamine (0.01 M) in 2-methoxyethanol was spin-coated on the FTO substrate. The substrate was heated at 120 °C for 15 min, and then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the film was immersed in a 20 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min. After drying, a ∼200 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 film was deposited on the pre-treated FTO substrate by spin-coating of a TiO2 paste in ethanol (1:3, mass ratio), and annealing at 450 °C for 30 min.
For the MAPbI3 perovskite layer, 461 mg of PbI2 and 99 mg, 198 mg, 297 mg or 396 mg of NMP (molar ratio: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3 or 1:4) were dissolved in DMF with the same Pb2+ concentration (1.3 M) at room temperature for the preparation of the precursor solutions. Then the precursor solution was spin-coated on the prepared substrate at 4000 rpm for 25 s. Then a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (50 mg mL−1) was added dropwise onto the film and spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 25 s. Afterwards, the as-coated film was heated at 110 °C for around 10 min to form a dense CH3NH3PbI3 film.
For the Cs/FA/MA perovskite film, 300.8 mg of PbI2, 35.8 mg of PbBr2 and 70 mg or 140 mg of NMP were dissolved in DMF with the same Pb2+ concentration (1.3 M) at room temperature for the preparation of the precursor solutions. Then the solution was spin-coated on the prepared substrate at 4000 rpm for 25 s. A solution of FAI/MABr in 2-propanol (50 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the as-prepared film at 4000 rpm for 25 s. The above film was then annealed at 110 °C for 10 min to obtain the Cs/FA/MA perovskite film.
In the deposition of the HTL, a spiro-OMeTAD solution was employed with 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 μL of TBP and 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg of Li-TSFI in 1 mL of acetonitrile) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was then deposited on the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an 80 nm thick Au counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under a reduced pressure of 2 × 10−7 Torr. The active area was 0.10 cm2. The whole fabrication procedures were carried out at a relative humidity of ∼20%.
Device characterization
Current–voltage characteristics were recorded using a solar simulator equipped with a Keithley 2400 source meter and a 300 W collimated Xenon lamp (Newport). The light intensity of the xenon lamp was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 under AM 1.5 G solar light conditions with a certified silicon solar cell. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured on a computer-controlled IPCE system (Newport) containing a xenon lamp, a monochromator and a Keithley multimeter. The system was calibrated with the certified silicon solar cell and IPCE data were collected in DC mode. XRD patterns were collected using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, RINT-2500) with a CuKα radiation source. Surface morphologies were recorded via a SEM-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). UV-vis spectra were measured for the perovskite films on mesoscopic TiO2 films using a UV-2550 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The steady-state photoluminescence spectra were measured with a CoMPox205 laser device. Electrical impedance spectroscopy and stabilized outputs of current density were measured on a potentiostat CHI 760E. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed using a thermal gravimetric analyzer TG 209F1.
Single-crystal analysis
Diffraction data were collected using an X-ray single-crystal diffractometer (Agilent Technologies SuperNova system) with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at 100 K. The data were processed using CrysAlis, and the crystal structure was solved and refined using full-matrix least-squares based on F2 with programs SHELXS-97 and SHELXL-97 within Olex2. The detailed crystallographic data are given in Table S2.†
