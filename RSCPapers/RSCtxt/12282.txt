    , Accepted 7th September 2020First published on 7th September 2020AbstractInterfacial modification is a key approach to improve performance in organic photovoltaic devices. Here, we demonstrate an environmentally friendly interfacial modifier, polyaspartic acid (PASP), which is inserted between ZnO and photoactive layers in inverted organic solar cells. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these solar cells based on a PM6:Y7 bulk heterojunction is boosted from 15.7% to 16.6%, due to a concurrently higher short-circuit current and fill factor. Revealed by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy coupled with charge transport measurements, the existence of an interfacial doping effect in ZnO/PASP induced by PASP was examined. An appropriate work function and surface wettability with a homogenous surface morphology are observed in ZnO/PASP electron transporting layers (ETLs). Furthermore, the optimized ETLs show universal applicability and enable better device stability. This work offers exciting prospects for using environmentally friendly materials to enrich our understanding of the interfacial properties of inverted OSCs.
Introduction
As a promising solar technology, organic solar cells (OSCs) offer advantages such as low cost, lightweight, flexibility, solution processability, and roll-to-roll printing technology.1–4 Recently, remarkable improvements have been made in terms of device engineering, mechanism studies, morphology optimization, and interface engineering to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability.5–8 At present, the-state-of-the-art PCE has exceeded 17% in single-junction organic solar cells, indicating a bright prospect of OSCs.9–11 Compared with the conventional device structure, an inverted configuration is advantageous potentially in device stability and improved electron extraction due to the application of a metal-oxide electron transporting layer (ETL) and the avoidance of active metal electrodes with a low work function.12–14 It is composed of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer sandwiched between the bottom electron transport layer (ETL) and the upper hole transport layer (HTL) with electrodes.15,16 The bottom cathode interfacial layer plays a vital role in charge extraction and recombination in organic solar cells.17,18 So far, various types of materials have been utilized as ETLs, including metal salts, polyelectrolytes, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), polymers, and metal oxides, in order to improve the device performance.19–23 Among them, zinc oxide (ZnO) is the most frequently used electron transport layer owing to its suitable energy level, solution processability, environmental friendliness, and higher transparency.24,25 However, ZnO sometimes exhibits unsatisfactory charge extraction and transport properties due to surface defects, non-homogeneous surface morphology, and incompatibility between the hydrophobic organic photoactive material and the hydrophilic surface of the ZnO layer, causing a substantial reduction in ultimate device performance.26–30
To overcome these shortcomings, several strategies have been employed, such as inserting interfacial modifiers, including polymers, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), and organic molecules between a metal oxide and a photoactive layer.31–33 To further enhance the interfacial contact for efficient electron transport and extraction processes, a lot of work has been carried out to modify ZnO ETLs using ionic liquids,34 acid functionalized N-annulated perylene diimide,35 carbon nano-onions (CNOs) and zinc oxide composites,36 delicate energy-level adjustment by ZnO/In nanojunctions26 and inorganic/organic gradient diffusion structures.37 It has been found that device performance can be improved by environmentally friendly solvent treatment and doping with metal ions.38–41 However, insight into the impact of interfacial properties on the physiochemical characteristics of sol–gel ZnO ETLs in inverted OSCs is still needed. This kind of investigation is not only essential for understanding the functions of ETLs but will also help in designing OSCs with better performance and device stability.
Biopolymers are promising alternatives for use as interface materials, due to their green and environment-friendly nature.42 Polyaspartic acid (PASP) is an environmentally friendly biopolymer and has been used as a surfactant, and a chelating and complexing agent. It contains amide and carboxyl (COO−) functional groups, which could chelate with metal ions and also has been utilized as a modifier for hole transporting layers in perovskite solar cells.43–45 To the best of our knowledge, PASP has not been explored as a buffer layer in organic solar cells to achieve modified interface properties and photovoltaic performance.
In this contribution, we introduce the environmentally friendly PASP (see Fig. 1a) as an interfacial modifier that is inserted between the photoactive layer and ZnO ETL. We investigate the interfacial properties of the ZnO/PASP electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted organic solar cells with multi BHJ blends including non-fullerene acceptors (Y7, IT4F and ITIC) and a fullerene acceptor (PC71BM). We found that the device based on ZnO/PASP ETL exhibits an increased Jsc and fill factor, and the ultimate power conversion efficiency reached 16.6% as compared to 15.7% in the control device (without PASP) in PM6:Y7 blends. Surface morphology and surface wettability of ZnO/PASP are examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and contact angle measurement, respectively, indicating a smooth surface morphology and a more hydrophobic surface of the ZnO/PASP ETL. Work function (WF) is investigated by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), showing a slightly lower WF value than the bare ZnO ETL. Electron spin resonance measurement revealed the presence of interfacial doping in ZnO induced by PASP while charge extraction and recombination kinetics of ZnO/PASP are explored by TPC and TPV. The transmission curve displayed that ZnO/PASP had no adverse impact on the absorption of light. Upon storage in a nitrogen atmosphere, PASP modified solar cells maintain 86% of their initial efficiency compared to 73% in bare ZnO devices after 25 days.

Results and discussion
PASP is a biodegradable polymer and has been used as a surfactant, and chelating and complexing agent. It contains amide and carboxyl (COO−) functional groups, which could chelate with metal ions, and has been utilized as a modifier for hole-transporting layers in perovskite solar cells.43–46 In this work, we explored PASP as a modifier for the ZnO electron-transporting layer in organic solar cells. We first investigated how the addition of PASP influences the morphology of ZnO thin films. As can be seen from topographic images (Fig. 1b and c), captured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode, the root mean square (RMS) roughness is 2.09 nm for a ZnO surface coated on ITO glass. In contrast, the ZnO/PASP based film is relatively smooth with a decreased RMS roughness of 0.91 nm, suggesting that PASP has a better film-forming ability on the top of the ZnO film. It is noted that such a kind of smooth morphology might be favourable to enhance the contact with the BHJ at the interface, leading to enhanced charge extraction and fill factors in organic solar cells.47,48 The surface wettability of the underlying interfacial layer is a significant factor for active layer formation in inverted OSCs. Considering that, we measured the water contact angle on ZnO/PASP and bare ZnO films. As can be seen in Fig. 1d and e, the contact angles on ZnO and ZnO/PASP films are 14.3° and 23.7°, respectively, signifying that the ZnO/PASP cathode interlayer is relatively more hydrophobic than the ZnO film, thus it can interact more efficiently with the hydrophobic organic active layer.49 As is known, matching of the work function (WF) of the electron transport layer with the LUMO of the acceptor is an important criterion. Therefore, to understand how the ZnO is influenced by incorporating a thin layer of polyaspartic acid (PASP), we determined the WFs of ZnO and ZnO/PASP films by ultraviolet spectroscopy (UPS), as shown in Fig. 2a. We attained a WF of 4.60, 4.03 eV and 4.01 eV for ITO, ITO/ZnO, and ITO/ZnO/PASP, respectively. Achieving a higher transparency is an essential criterion for an electron transporting layer in inverted OSCs. In this context, we measured the transmittance of ETLs using UV/Vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 2b. From the results, it is clear that the addition of a thin film of PASP has no adverse effect on the transparency of ZnO in the entire spectrum. We also explored the absorption spectra of the BHJ (PM6:Y7) film cast on top of ZnO and ZnO/PASP films, respectively, as given in the ESI,† (Fig. S1). As expected, both spectra almost overlap, indicating that the photon flux in a solar cell is not affected by the addition of a thin film of PASP onto the ZnO surface.

Next, we investigated the structure and chemical interaction between PASP and ZnO using FTIR spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2c, the broad peak around 3318 cm−1 belongs to N–H starching vibration while the peaks at 1601 cm−1, 1394 cm−1, and 1189 cm−1 are attributed to the CO, C–N, and C–O starching modes of PASP, respectively.50,51 In the case of ZnO/PASP, the peak of CO at 1601 cm−1 shifts to a lower wavelength (1580 cm−1) and becomes slightly weaker, and the relatively sharp peak of C–O at 1185 cm−1 appeared, which might be due to the chelating function between PASP and ZnO through the carboxyl group.52,53 The peak of Zn–O appeared at 740 cm−1.17
With the elucidated interfacial interaction of PASP on top of the ZnO thin film, we further gained more insights and examined the interfacial doping effect in ETLs. As previously reported, interfacial doping is one of the main strategies in an organic solar cell to improve the charge extraction that leads to boosting the overall device performance.17,54 In this context, we examined the charge transfer between PASP and ZnO by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy.55 As shown in Fig. 2d, there is no ESR peak detected in the pure ZnO or PASP samples. Interestingly, we observed a prominent ESR peak in the ZnO/PASP samples with a g value of 2.003 (magnetic field = 3510–3515). Such a feature supports the existence of interfacial doping in ZnO induced by PASP, which improves charge transport and collection in ZnO/PASP.17,55,56
Next, we compared the electrical conductivity of the ZnO and ZnO/PASP film coated on the ITO substrate in contact mode using conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM), as shown in Fig S2 in the ESI.† The current measured through ZnO/PASP is 32.44, 51.65, 82.93, and 140.36 pA at +1 V, +2 V, +3 V and +4 V, which is higher than the values for ZnO that amount to 11.14, 26.96, 37.87, and 65.48 pA under the same bias condition. The modified electrical properties can be attributed to the doping effect induced by PASP.
Due to the suitable work function, and appropriate optical and electrical properties of the ZnO/PASP thin film, we then utilized it as an ETL in organic solar cells and focused on understanding the influence of the PASP layer on the photovoltaic characteristics. Here, we adopted the inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/(PASP)/BHJ/MoO3/Al, as shown in Fig. 3a, and the structural formulae of different BHJ materials used in this work are given in Fig. 3b. To determine the optimal film thickness, we first tested the device behavior with PASP cast from various concentrations using PBDBT:ITIC as a photoactive layer.57 Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the device based on PBDBT:ITIC under AM 1.5G standard solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2). The corresponding solar cell device parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). From the result, the control device using ZnO as the ETL exhibits a Jsc of 16.61 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.88 V, a FF of 68.93%, and PCE = 10.1%. The best device performance (Voc = 0.88 V, Jsc = 17.35 mA cm−2, FF = 70.30%, and PCE = 10.7%) was achieved with a 0.4 mg mL−1 concentration of PASP solution, and film thickness was measured to be 2 nm by ellipsometry (see Fig. S4, ESI†). The Jsc calculated from the EQE spectra is 15.79 and 16.50 mA cm−2 for ZnO and PASP-modified ZnO, respectively, in the PBDBT:ITIC devices (see Fig. S5, ESI†), which is in good agreement with the values obtained from J–V measurement with less than 5% deviations. Fig. 3c shows the control and best device obtained using PBDBT:ITIC as a BHJ. The variation in the performance with lower and higher PASP concentrations is probably due to poor coverage and high contact resistance, respectively. With an established optimum PASP thickness, we then investigated the impact of ZnO/PASP in other non-fullerene BHJ systems, such as PM6:Y7 and PBDBT2F:IT4F photoactive layers, as shown in Fig. 3d and e, while the device parameters of the relevant solar cells are summarized in Table 1. The control device based on the neat ZnO electron transport layer for PM6:Y7 BHJ layers yields a PCE = 15.7% consistent with the reported value in the literature.58 As expected, the device with ZnO/PASP shows a pronounced enhancement in Jsc (from 24.82 mA cm−2 to 25.64 mA cm−2, the integrated JEQE values shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) are 23.73 mA cm−2 and 24.40 mA cm−2, respectively) and fill factor (FF, from 73.70% to 75.32%), and the resultant PCE reached 16.6%. In the control device, ITO/ZnO/PBDBT-2F:IT4F/MoO3/Al, we attained the efficiency of 13.1% with a Jsc of 20.72 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.84 V and a FF of 75.10% while the PASP containing device exhibited a higher PCE of 13.6% with an increased Jsc from 20.72 mA cm−2 to 21.30 mA cm−2 (the EQE-integrated Jsc is 19.80 and 20.31 mA cm−2 for ZnO and ZnO/PASP based devices, respectively, with less than 5% deviation, see Fig. S7, ESI†) and FF from 75.10% to 76.26% (Fig. 3e). We further measured the J–V characteristics of ZnO and ZnO/PASP based ETLs with a fullerene system of a PTB7:PCB71BM active layer to explore the universality (Fig. 3f). The same trend was observed in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM photoactive layer. The optimized control device yields a Jsc = 16.34 mA cm−2 (calculated Jsc from the EQE spectra is 15.90 mA cm−2), a Voc = 0.79 V, a FF = 64.65% and a PCE of 8.4%, whereas the ZnO/PASP based device produces a slightly enhanced Jsc = 16.68 mA cm−2 (Jsc = 16.21 mA cm−2, obtained from EQE spectra, Fig. S8, ESI†), FF = 65.64% and ultimate efficiency reaching 8.7%. These results reveal that the inserted PASP mainly supports the enhancement of the device performance. The higher Jsc and FF may be correlated to the interfacial doping effect induced by PASP and comparatively hydrophobic and smooth surface of ZnO/PASP, leading to efficient electron extraction and better contact with the photoactive layer. We can also observe a clear enhancement in the PCE of different BHJ systems with and without the PASP layer, as shown in Fig. 3g. In order to unveil the function of PASP in improving the device performance, the surface morphology of both films with and without PASP/BHJ films (here, we chose PM6:Y7 as an example) was also examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 4a and b, ZnO/BHJ shows a RMS of 1.46 nm while the ZnO/PASP/BHJ surface is quite smooth and homogenous with a decreased root-mean-square roughness of 1.10 nm. The homogeneous surface of a BHJ is favourable to accelerate charge transport more efficiently towards the respective electrode and eventually beneficial for the photovoltaic performance. Then, we used GIWAX to explore the molecular packing of the BHJ with and without the PASP interlayer. The two-dimensional GIWAXS pattern of the PM6:Y7 blend is displayed in Fig. 4c and d and the 1-dimensional profile curves extracted along the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions are shown in Fig. 4e and f, respectively. We observed noticeable π–π stacking at 1.72 Å−1 in both films, suggesting that favourable face-on orientations exist in the OOP direction (π–π stacking of 3.65 Å).

In contrast, no distinct IP orientation was observed in the one-dimensional profile. The peak at 1.72 Å for ZnO/PASP/PM6:Y7 (Fig. 4f) is slightly more pronounced in the OOP direction than for ZnO/PM6:Y7. A slight modification in the molecular orientation may arise by a change in surface morphology and wettability caused by the insertion of the ZnO/PASP based interlayer, as we reported in our previous work.30
To acquire more understanding of the improved fill factor and Jsc, we further used transient photocurrent (TPC) and transient photovoltage (TPV) to assess the charge extraction process and carrier lifetime in PM6:Y7 solar cells with ZnO and ZnO/PASP ETLs. TPC decay kinetics of both ETLs were measured under short-circuit conditions excited at 488 nm based on mono-exponential decay fitting, as shown in Fig. 5a. The charge extraction time was determined to be 37 ns for ZnO/PASP, which is obviously shorter than that of the ZnO based device, which was determined to be 52 ns, indicating a higher carrier extraction ability of ZnO/PASP ETLs. Similarly, we extracted the carrier lifetime for both devices with and without PASP. The control device showed a shorter lifetime (66.2 μs), whereas there was a pronounced enhancement in the ZnO/PASP solar cells (78.5 μs) (see Fig. 5b). The prolonged carrier lifetime and superior charge extraction properties with a smooth surface morphology, as aforementioned, can clarify the enhancement in Jsc and fill-factor in the PASP/ZnO based device. As charge extraction and recombination both depend on charge transport properties, we examined the carrier mobility in these devices to gain more insights into the modified device behaviors with expedited charge extraction. We adopted the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method using single-carrier devices (ITO/ETL/BHJ/Al) (Fig. S9, ESI†). The electron mobility in PM6:Y7 was determined to be 5.75 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.13 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for devices with ZnO/PASP and ZnO ETLs, respectively. The relatively higher mobility with PASP-modified ZnO can be beneficial for the suppression of charge accumulation at the electrode interface and resultant charge recombination.

(c) Normalized PCE decay verses storage time of ITO/ZnO/PM6:Y7/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/PASP/PM6:Y7/MoO3/Al devices stored in a nitrogen-filled glove box. 
Finally, we examined the stability of the devices (dark storage in a glove box) through measuring the photovoltaic performance in a nitrogen-filled glove box (water level = 0.1 ppm; level = 0.1 ppm) at 25 °C. As shown in Fig. 5c, the control device shows a comparatively fast degradation rate with PCE decreased to 11.6% from 15.7% of the original PCE after 25 days. This indicates that a device with bare ZnO can retain only 73% of the initial PCE. In contrast, the ZnO/PASP based device exhibits minor degradation under the same set of conditions, and the PCE decreased from 16.6% to 14.3%, which means that 86% of the initial performance is retained in the device with the ZnO/PASP interlayer. This improvement may relate to the well stabilized ZnO/PASP electron transport layer, which prevents the device from degradation.
Conclusion
To summarize, we developed an effective interfacial strategy to improve the electron extraction properties by inserting environmentally friendly polyaspartic acid (PASP) on the top of ZnO in inverted OSCs. Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements reveal the existence of an interfacial doping effect in ZnO induced by PASP. Improved charge extraction and a longer carrier lifetime were confirmed by TPC and TPV measurements. Under the optimal conditions, we achieved improved PCEs from 15.7% to 16.6% based on PM6:Y7 BHJs, due to a concurrently increased short-circuit current and fill factor. The homogeneous surface morphology with a relatively lower hydrophilicity of ZnO/PASP leads to improved interfacial contact with the hydrophobic organic active layers and the molecular packing of the BHJ layers. Advantageously, with the inserted PASP, the stability of the PM6:Y7 device considerably improves, leading to it maintaining 86% of its original efficiency after 25 days. This work offers exciting prospects for using environmentally friendly materials to enrich our understanding on interfacial properties in inverted OSCs.

PM6:Y7, PBDBT-2F:IT4F, PBDBT: ITIC, and PTB7:PC71BM were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc (Beijing). Chlorobenzene (CB), 1.8-diiodooctane (DIO) and chroronaphthanlen (CN) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and TCI, respectively. Zinc acetate dihydrate, ethanolamine, and MoO3 were purchased from Alfa Aesar inc. 2-Methoxy ethanol was purchased from Aladdin. PASP solution (40 mg mL−1; concentration) was received from Maya-Rc Company, China.
Solution preparation
For the preparation of the sol–gel ZnO solution, zinc acetate dihydrate (100 mg) and ethanolamine (30 μL) were mixed in 2-methoxy ethanol (1 mL). The final solution was stirred at room temperature for at least 8–10 hours. PASP solutions (concentration: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 mg mL−1) were prepared by diluting the as-received PASP aqueous solution (40 mg mL−1) with deionized water. The PM6:Y7 (w/w, 1:1) blend was completely dissolved in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 and stirred for 4 hours at 80 °C in a nitrogen-filled glove box. Before spin coating, 0.5 vol% chroronaphthalene (CN) was added as an additive. PBDBT:ITIC was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) at a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 and then stirred for at least 3 hours at 60 °C. 0.5 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added before spin coating the active layers (preparation conditions for the PBDBT2F:IT4F and PBDBT:ITIC blend solutions were the same). PTB7:PC71BM solutions were prepared by dissolving the donor and acceptor compounds (blend ratio was w/w, 1:1.5) in chlorobenzene with a total concentration of 12 mg mL−1 and stirring at 60 °C for 3–4 hours; finally, 3 vol% DIO (v/v, DIO:CB) was added before solution-casting.
Device fabrication
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonicator followed by ultraviolet-ozone (UV-O3) treatment for 20 minutes. The ZnO solution was spin-coated on ITO at 5000 rpm for 30 s. After spin coating, the ZnO coated substrate was annealed at 160 °C for 30 minutes, then the PASP solution (0.4 mg mL−1) was coated on ZnO at 3000 rpm at 130 °C for 10 minutes and then transferred into a glove-box filled with inert nitrogen. Afterward, PM6:Y7 solution was spin-coated at 300 rpm for 60 s followed by thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 minutes.

Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) provided by an Oriel solar simulator. The incident light intensity was adjusted with a silicon calibration photodiode (Peccell Technologies). Single carrier devices were characterized by using a Keithley 2400 source in the dark. The EQE spectra were measured by using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech, Taiwan). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The transmittance and absorbance spectra were attained by using a UV-Vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 650/850/950 UV-Vis spectrophotometer). The FTIR spectra were recorded using a Spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer (PerkinElmer Instruments, Inc.). Topographic AFM images were acquired by using a Nanoscope V AFM (Bruker) microscope in tapping-mode. ESR measurements were performed using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 instrument. For ESR analysis, three sets of samples were prepared with (1) DMPO (10 μL) + (50 μL) DI water; (2) DMPO (10 μL) + 2-methoxy ethanol (50 μL); (3) DMPO (10 μL) + 2-methoxy ethanol (25 μL) + DI water (25 μL). For the ESR characterization: (1) DMPO (10 μL) was added to (50 μL) PASP solution in water; (2) DMPO (10 μL) was added to Sol–gel ZnO in 2-methoxy ethanol (50 μL); (3) DMPO (10 μL) was added into a mixture of (25 μL) PASP solution in water + Sol–gel ZnO in 2-methoxy ethanol (25 μL). c-AFM was performed by using an Asylum Research MFP-3D microscope in contacting mode with Ti/Ir coated tips. The UPS measurements were performed using a Bruker ESCALAB250Xi system. Contact angle characterization was performed using a DSA100, Kruss. GIWAXS analyses were performed by using a BXEUSS SAXS/WAXS system.
