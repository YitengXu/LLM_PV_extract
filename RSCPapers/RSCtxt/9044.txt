    , Accepted 28th November 2006First published on 9th January 2007AbstractA detailed reaction mechanism for n-heptane oxidation has been compiled and subsequently simplified. The model is based on a kinetic model for C1–C4 fuel oxidation of Hoyermann et al. [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2004, 6, 3824] and a detailed mechanism for n-heptane oxidation developed by Curran et al. [Combust. Flame, 1998, 114, 149]. The generated mechanism is kept compact by limiting the application of the low temperature oxidation pathways to the fuel molecule. The first reaction steps and the complex low temperature paths in the oxidation process have been simplified and reorganized by linear chemical lumping. The reported procedure allows a decrease in number of species and reactions with only a minor loss of model accuracy. The simplified model is of very compact size and gives an advantageous starting point for further model reduction. By this chemically lumped general mechanism without further adjustments the large set of experimental data for the high and low temperature oxidation (ignition delay times, species concentration profiles, heat release and engine pressure profiles, flame speeds and flame structure data) for conditions ranging from very low to high temperatures (550–2300 K), very lean to extremely fuel rich (0.22 < ϕ < 3) mixtures and pressures between 1 and 42 bar is consistently described providing a basis for reliable predictions for future applications, (i) building reaction mechanisms for similar but chemically more complex fuels (e.g. iso-octane, n-decane,…) and (ii) calculating complex flow fields (“fluid dynamics”) after further simplification with advanced reduction tools.
Introduction
Combustion of fossil fuels is the major energy source and will not lose this status in the decades to come. The challenge of global warming and the shortness of fossil energy sources rise the demands on efficiency and performance of current operating combustors and therefore research in this field is in the focus of both science and industry.1,2 To some degree fuels based on biomass or generated from solar energy will substitute those produced from fossil sources, especially for liquid fuels biomass is a suitable renewable source.3 This is essential since for conventional aircraft jet engines no propulsion system is conceivable that does not use the combustion of liquids. Moreover, a sustainable supply with necessary quantities of liquid hydrocarbons produced from biomass or solar energy is feasible and potentially perpetuates a hydrocarbon based fuel supply.2,3
The chemical process of fuel degradation can be studied and modelled using detailed chemical reaction mechanisms. These mechanisms help to deepen the understanding of the chemical part of the combustion process, they give information about ways to improve fuel qualities and are practical modelling tools in engineering research.
The development of a reliable kinetic model demands, even for larger hydrocarbons, the incorporation of a thoroughly and widely validated base chemistry. In a recent study4 such a detailed reaction mechanism for high temperatures including the O2/H2 chemistry and the reactions of C1–C4 species was compiled that is broadly validated against flame speeds, ignition delay times and species concentration profiles of a variety of fuels under different mixture strengths, temperatures and pressures. This mechanism is based on mechanisms of Warnatz and co-workers5–7 and Wang and Frenklach8 and refined by enlarging substantially the range of test cases beyond those of the original ones. By these means the risk of fitting parameters in an over-parameterized system is reduced. The present work expands this strategy to the study of a new fuel, the primary reference fuel (PRF) component n-heptane using in addition to the validation of the high temperature chemistry a large set of experiments performed at low and medium temperatures and higher pressures as critical test cases. The n-heptane oxidation model for high and low temperatures is taken from the extensive work of Curran et al.9
The low temperature combustion exhibits very complex reactivity behaviour involving competing multi-step reaction pathways for the key reactions of RO2 species with transition states of similar energy.10 Due to this complexity many fast reaction sequences have up to now been described in phenomenological terms. Therefore, in addition to the ongoing efforts on the independent determination of kinetic data for key elementary reactions, the predictiveness of the mechanism can be improved by testing the model predictions against an enlarged number of phenomenological parameters (ignition delay times, flame speeds, heat release, species concentration profiles and combustion conditions (pressure, temperature, mixture strengths, different reactor types and fuels). We further note that n-heptane is an important benchmark fuel for mechanisms of higher hydrocarbons appearing in model fuels e.g. n-decane, n-tetradecane. The low and medium temperature oxidation of these fuels involves carbonyl compounds for which evaluated kinetic data is available for the first oxidation steps but often limited to atmospheric conditions at much lower temperatures.11a,b Evaluated kinetic data is missing for the reactions of large radical carbonyl species at medium temperatures.11c It is therefore important to prove that kinetic data for reaction classes introduced in the n-heptane mechanism9 lead to accurate model predictions over a wide range of parameters. After this stage of mechanism development an improved base is created to discuss the complex kinetics of large carbonyls.
Many studies on the oxidation of n-heptane over a wide range of temperatures, pressures and fuel air equivalence ratios (ϕ) have been presented in the literature. Several experimental procedures have been used to unravel the chemistry of the combustion process of this PRF: shock tubes,12–15 jet stirred reactors,16,17 flow reactors18,19 and burners.20,21 Pressure histories from HCCI (homogeneous charge compression ignition) engine experiments represent an additional sensitive test of the low and high temperature chemistry22 under conditions not available in the aforementioned experiments. We therefore take the step to include engine experiments into this kinetic study extending the range of validity of the kinetic model.
As calculation power became affordable in the last decade a lot of work was focused on the development of detailed n-heptane reaction mechanisms23–25 which have been validated against different reactors, shock tube and rapid compression machine experiments. However, these mechanisms introduce a large number of species and elementary steps prohibiting the direct incorporation in simulations of complex reactor models, e.g. with turbulent flow. Future model fuels will become multi component mixtures. Hence, both comprehensive and compact models are needed for the pure components to achieve predictive power for combustion characteristics of mixtures at affordable computational costs.
Therefore, kinetic model reduction has received attention from both the mathematics community and researchers in application areas.26 A number of methods have been summarized in ref. 27. The reduction methods can be classified in rough outlines by the terms lumping, removal of unnecessary species and reactions, reduction by the quasi steady state assumption (QSSA) and tabulation. The usage of lumping and removal techniques reduces the complexity of the system, thus making it useful to apply these techniques before introducing QSSA or tabulation—reducing either the size and complexity of the algebraic system or the CPU time needed to perform the tabulation. A weakness of the removal techniques is that they fail to condense mechanisms with many parallel paths. But the low temperature mechanisms for the oxidation of aliphatic hydrocarbons exhibit a large number of these essential reactions steps, a characteristic feature of the low temperature oxidation. This is exemplified in Fig. 1. Attempts to apply these removal techniques starting with the detailed n-heptane mechanism of Curran et al. (544 species, ca. 4800 reactions) generated so called skeleton mechanisms that are still large, i.e. 188 species and 1684 reactions,28 246 species, 1462 reactions.29 In anticipation of the results this is to be compared with the kinetic models presented here: 246 species, 2309 reactions for the detailed, 196 species, 2079 reactions for the lumped mechanism that can be further dramatically reduced if removal techniques are applied.30 It is therefore emphasized that parallel reaction paths are first lumped before species are removed. Mechanism lumping can be performed strictly mathematically26,31 or using kinetic information from pre-calculated reactor experiments.32 Other authors perform the lumping of the reaction mechanism intuitively, by pre-defining the structure of the low temperature kinetics33 and adjusting the rate kinetic data. In addition semi empirical models are presented.19,34 In this paper we follow a linear lumping approach that was used by Frenklach to lump polyaromatic hydrocarbons of different sizes but with the same functional groups.35 The method that was already foreshadowed in ref. 30 will be explained in detail.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the main low temperature reaction pathways of the detailed n-heptane oxidation model. Formation of olefins is neglected for simplification in the illustration. 
Since the validation test cases of n-heptane mechanisms published so far either lack the validation against flame experiments if the low and medium temperature regime is tested9,19,23,24 or low temperature ignition validation is limited or not presented if flames are simulated20,21,25 we focus in this study on both extensive tests for the low temperature ignition and a validation against flame experiments. The base for the mechanism presented here is the aforementioned high temperature C1–C4 mechanism. The n-heptane oxidation model is taken from the work of Curran et al.9,36 but kept factual by limiting the application of the low temperature pathways to the fuel molecule. By this a comparable compact detailed mechanism is generated, which is tested for a series of experiments of this n-heptane oxidation chemistry module (shock tube, plug flow reactor, jet stirred reactor) but enriched by predictions of flame speeds and flame structure data for temperatures up to 2300 K and HCCI-engine pressure histories at very lean conditions. The simplified model, derived from a linear lumping procedure, consists of a significantly lower number of species and is also extensively validated. Moreover, it is shown that calculations concerning the n-heptane mechanism presented here exactly match the test cases of the C1–C4 base mechanism.4
All calculations were performed using DARS.37
Chemical model
The chemical model presented in this paper builds on mechanisms developed by Warnatz, Wang and Frenklach, as well as Curran and Westbrook. This compilation is motivated by our aim to combine evaluated high temperature kinetics together with oxidation chemistry for higher hydrocarbon fuels at low and high temperatures. The base for the C1–C4 chemisty is the mechanism of Hoyermann et al.4 It was build on the mechanism of Warnatz et al.5–7 and Wang and Frenklach.8 In the present study some modifications to the base mechanism have been conducted due to the expansion of the presented mechanism to medium and low temperature combustion processes. The thermodynamic data of the base mechanism is given as an electronic supplement of ref. 4. The C5–C7 reactions characteristic for n-heptane oxidation follow the model of Curran et al.9 The thermodynamic data for these C5–C7 and additional C1–C4 species are taken from the Westbrook database.62 In the mechanism of Curran et al. 25 major classes of elementary reactions were considered for n-heptane degradation. Classes 1–9 belong to the high temperature mechanism, classes 10–25 are linked to the low temperature oxidation. The mechanism presented in this work is compiled in analogy to these reaction classes and is presented in Table 1. The rate coefficients are given with the original references to help the reader trace back the underlying experimental and theoretical studies. Different from Curran et al. we apply the complete set of reaction classes to the seed molecule of the mechanism (n-heptane) only. This is reasoned by the fact that other alkanes (C4H10, C5H12, C6H14) are solely produced from olefins (C4H8, C5H10, C6H12). Since the initiating reaction of this path for olefin consumption (backward reaction of class 3):  is only efficient if free radicals are available, low temperature kinetics are not of importance. Hence we include reaction class 3 only (in addition to classes 6–9) for olefin consumption. This restriction in the mechanism generation process does have a dramatic impact on the size of the resulting detailed mechanism with 246 species and 2309 reactions. These numbers can be compared to those reported by Curran et al.9 (550 species and ca. 4800 reactions) and the numbers for skeleton mechanisms after reduction (188 species and 1684 reactions,28 246 species, 1462 reactions29).

In Table 1 and in the text we use the same naming conventions as introduced by Curran et al., with R and R′, denoting alkyl radicals or structures and Q, denoting C2H2n species or structures. Rate constants for analogous occurrences in different molecules are the same for each of these classes. The total rate for a specific reaction in its class is given by the rate for the occurrence, for example tertiary H-atom abstraction, times the number of active sites in the molecule. More information on kinetic details is found in ref. 9.
The modified kinetic model for the n-heptane degradation was added as a module to the base mechanism, ref. 4. The kinetic data taken from Curran also include much low and some intermediate temperature chemistry of C1–C4 species not taken into account in the base mechanism which has been geared to high temperature oxidation. Therefore the reactions of the species HOCH2O, HOCHO, OCHO, O2CHO and HO2CHO have been added and some reactions of H2O2, HO2, HCO and CHO2 were substituted in the base chemistry with those used by Curran et al. These reactions are found in Table 2, where all reactions are listed (except for those belonging to classes 1–25 already listed in Table 1) that were added or have undergone changes compared to the base mechanisms. The full mechanism and thermodynamic data are given as an electronic supplement.‡ The main degradation pathways in the low temperature regime according to a reaction flow analysis are illustrated in Fig. 1.

Some changes to the kinetic scheme were conducted in the optimisation procedure in order to improve the predictive power of the new mechanism. Those changes which have the greatest impact on model predictions are discussed below.
The reaction class one, the unimolecular fuel decomposition, represents the initiating process in oxidative and pyrolytic combustion at high temperatures. The reverse reactions, the radical combinations are important termination reactions. The rate values for both directions are sensitive for high temperature ignition delay. There is only very little information available on these combination reactions often used to calculate the decomposition rates via microscopic reversibilty.9 The same holds for the information available for the specific decomposition channels of n-C7H16. Experimental and theoretical studies of alkane decomposition show a large decrease of A-factors of C–C bond cleavages with a rising chain length of alkanes.38 Complications arise from effects of chemical activation pathways after radical recombination and uncertainty in thermodynamical data of large alkyl radicals which have a major impact on rate coefficients calculated from chemical equilibrium. This is discussed in examinations of kinetic data on C1–C4 alkane decomposition combined with RRKM calculations by Tsang.38,63 We followed the findings of Tsang and used for the reactions of class 1 similar activation energies and A-factors extrapolated from n-propane and iso-butane. This pragmatic approach leads to rate expressions comparable to those applied by Curran et al. for reaction class 1 in their iso-octane mechanism.64 The reaction classes 2 and 9 of the n-heptane degradation model were also subject to changes. In reaction class 2, the H-atom abstraction from the fuel molecule by H-atoms was increased and is now in good agreement with recommendations of Tsang for the analogous reactions of propane.65 However, we use the upper limit of the propane recommendation range since the H abstraction rate shows a strong increase moving from ethane to propane. This shows that even for key reactions in combustion environment more kinetic data for larger molecules such as n-C7H16 are needed allowing more reliable extrapolations from analogous reactions of smaller alkanes. For the H abstraction by O atoms we follow the study of Michael et al. using slightly lower rates.41 The H abstraction by HO2 was also subject to a change and has been increased by a factor of 2. The resulting rate is in good agreement with the study of Baldwin et al.43 for C2H6 + HO2, one of the few experimentally determined values available in the literature and base for extrapolated rates for analogous reaction of hydrocarbons with longer C atom chains. The changes in classes 1 and 2 reflect the expansion of the Curran test case set to a much more detailed high temperature validation which comprises recent high temperature shock tube ignition delay data.12,13 Reaction class 9, the decomposition of the three C7H14 isomers (1-, 2-, 3-C7H14), was already in the first mechanism of Curran et al. seen as a candidate for future mechanism improvement.9 In the 2002 updated version36 Curran and co-workers reduced the number of product channels from 5(1-C7H14), 4(2-C7H14) and 3(3-C7H14) to only 1 characteristic decomposition for each isomer and lowered the rate coefficient by a factor of 2.5. Based on an analysis of the reaction flow we favoured two specific decompositions for each isomer and used the same rate constant as in the original Curran et al. mechanism, recommended by Edelson and Allara.42 Some other changes were carried out for the reaction classes 11, 13, 15–18, 20 where more recent data published for iso-octane by Curran et al.64 is taken as reference for the same class of reactions. This has been done partly to improve the predictions of the n-heptane mechanism and mainly to achieve consistency for these reaction classes with an iso-octane mechanism compiled in our group that is a matter of future publication. For information about the choice of kinetic parameters for these reaction types we refer to the n-heptane and iso-octane papers of Curran et al. where an extensive discussion is found.9,64 The reactions of species carrying a carbonyl group are also taken from Curran et al. and a few reactions that are also listed in Table 2 were subject to modifications. For example, the rates for H-atom abstraction of aldehydes and ketones by HO2 radicals have been slightly increased and are now similar to the recommendation of Eiteneer et al. for formaldehyde56 and d’Anna et al.60 for butyraldehyde. The rate coefficients for the reactions of C2H5, n-C3H7 with O2 are taken from an extensive recent experimental and theoretical study of DeSain et al.10
We state that comparable few changes to the kinetic models were performed after the module-wise addition of the two mechanisms. The major changes are connected with the lumping technique discussed in the next section which is used for model simplification and reorganisation of low temperature oxidation pathways.
Lumping procedure
Chemical lumping is a common technique to reduce the complexity of a chemical model. In short, it simplifies a mechanism by replacing a set of reactions of isomeric species by a much smaller set where single, “lumped” pseudo species represent the isomers. The aim is to reduce the complexity of the mechanisms and the number of variables but still to maintain the important features of full schemes. In general the lumped set of reactions should as well as possibly map the reaction flow and heat release of the detailed scheme and give similar results for the key model predictions. In the simplest case the assumption holds that the concentrations of the isomers are equal. Here only the stoichiometries have to be balanced for reactions involving both lumped and original species and the reduction can be performed automatically. In this case of linear lumping kinetic parameters for the lumped pseudo species are obtained as weighted means of the individual rate coefficients. Unfortunately these assumptions do not apply in general and it is not clear if, in principle, more complex a priori assumptions for an automatic lumping procedure can be found as Tomlin et al. stated in an overview article on mechanism construction and reduction techniques.27
However, it is a reasonable aim to explore to what extent chemical reaction schemes can be reduced with linear chemical lumping (allowing some refinements) with an acceptable loss of accuracy. The motivation of this strategy is the applicability of linear lumping for automatic mechanism generation. Especially the complexity of models for the oxidation of larger hydrocarbons, e.g. n-decane, rises drastically with the fuel size and an intrinsic lumping procedure can limit effectively the number of species and reactions already in the compilation process, regardless of whether performed automatically or by hand.
Mechanisms reduced by lumping have also the potential to give an advantageous starting point for further model reduction of very complex reaction schemes. With a rising number of isomeric species the analysis of reaction mechanisms is complicated because the criteria to discriminate “important” from “unimportant” species in automatic reduction methods28,66 may fail if the importance of a single isomeric species is low but the reaction path via all isomers is significant. Applying a lumping technique allows to largely condense the overall reaction flow in the main reaction paths via lumped species and the discrimination of the most “important” species and the connected paths is more reliable.
There exist many studies on n-heptane mechanisms reduction19,28,29,32,67,68 where different reduction techniques have been applied. Chemical lumping has been used for model simplification in the studies of Ranzi et al.32 and Fournet et al.67 Ranzi and co-workers evaluated the internal distributions of the isomers and the proper stoichiometries of the simplified set of reactions from calculations with the detailed mechanism. Fournet et al. presented an automatic method for reducing detailed mechanisms of alkane combustion. The method is based on the a priori assumptions named above, simple stoichiometry balance and kinetic parameter weighting. These examples of n-heptane mechanism reduction applying lumping techniques show good agreement between model predictions and experimental data for the chosen test cases. However for a more comprehensive approach a significantly wider range of experimental conditions for the validation of the reduced mechanism is necessary.
In this study the approach of linear lumping has been chosen with some modifications. For the non-oxygenated species in classes 1 to 11 and the peroxyl and alkoxy radicals in the reaction classes 13 to 18 simple linear lumping has been applied and thus all isomers lumped to one species are assumed to have equal concentrations. The resulting rate coefficients are weighted by the rates for the lumped isomers and the numbers of educts and products in the reaction equation. If isomers with different thermodynamic data are lumped these differences have been taken into account in the formulation of the calculated rate coefficients of the backward reactions. In the lumped scheme we describe the total backward reaction as the sum of duplicate reactions with the different backward rate coefficients of the former isomeric species. Introducing one lumped species the source term ωx for the differential equation is transformed from a single species x = j, via the isomers x = l to the lumped species x = L as follows: (1)      with NR denoting the number of reactions, NS the total number of species, NL the number of species lumped to L, cx the concentration of species x, νx,k = ν″x,k
				−
				ν′x,k is the net stoichiometric coefficient of species x in reaction k where ν′ indicates the reactants and ν″ the products, kk the rate coefficient of reaction k.
After lumping we calculate the new number of species:  The new rate coefficients:  And the new stoichiometric coefficients of the lumped species in the reaction:  Eqn (1) then reads: (2)where ν′i,k = ν′*L,k for i = L
Further lumping of species transforms the source term sequentially in this manner. To illustrate the effect of lumping on the reaction flow the results of simulations of an experimental test case with both the detailed and the lumped mechanism are compared. In Fig. 2a the concentration profiles of the four isomeric C7H15 radicals, their summed up profile and the profile of the lumped pseudo-species L-C7H15 are displayed. The good match of the “summed” and “lumped” profiles ensures that the reaction flow through C7H15 is adequately represented by the lumped mechanism. A comparable agreement is found for summed and lumped profiles at higher and lower temperatures.
 Fig. 2  Comparison of predicted concentration profiles with the detailed and the lumped mechanism. The isomers are listed in all figures in order of their maximum concentrations: (a) C7H15 isomers, (b) C7H14OOH (A) isomers, illustration of the significantly lower concentrations of the p-species (c) secondary A isomers, (d) primary A isomers, (e) main products formed in reaction classes 21 and 24. Initial conditions: p = 13.5 bar, ϕ = 1.0 and T = 800 K. The axis for the lumped species is slightly shifted (+0.016 ms) to compensate the small differences in ignition delay time. 
For the reactions of the oxygenated species which are the key to simulating low temperature ignition and its typical effects like the NTC-behaviour (negative temperature coefficient) between 700–950 K the lumping procedure has been refined. Since the fate of the oxygenated radicals is decomposition after isomerisations, partial or complete oxidation the specific decomposition products determine significantly the reactivity of the mechanism. For this reason simple linear lumping, e.g. of the four QOOH isomers, would change the overall reactivity of the mechanism, e.g. ignition delay times, in case species with rather low concentrations but very reactive decomposition products are linearly lumped with others. An analysis of species concentration profiles for different classes of isomers in 0-dimensional ignition simulations shows that isomer concentrations often differ strongly. But it also revealed that oxygenated radicals with either the radical position or the functional group at a primary site show much lower concentrations compared to radicals with neither function nor the radical site at the primary position. This observation is illustrated in Fig. 2b for QOOH radicals formed in class 12. Moreover these different types of oxygenated species decompose to radicals with comparable reactivity. We therefore introduced two types of lumped species to describe the low and medium temperature oxidation process. The species are labelled with the prefix p- for primary and s- for secondary species with respect to the positions of the radical site or the functional group. Fig. 2c,d illustrate that separate linear lumping of these primary and secondary species leads once again to lumped species that adequately represent the sum of the isomeric species. Only a minimum time axis shift between the isomers and the lumped species is seen and thus the ignition delay time remains virtually unchanged after lumping. A comparable agreement is found for summed and lumped profiles at higher and lower temperatures. This is reflected by the very close match of ignition delay times calculated with both mechanisms for various temperatures, pressures and mixtures presented below in the validation part. It is important to show that the major decomposition products formed at the end of the oxidation process in the reaction classes 21 and 24 are also predicted in good agreement between the detailed and the lumped mechanism (see Fig. 2e). In Fig. 3 the main part of the resulting reduced mechanism is displayed. A comparison with Fig. 1 shows that the two first reaction steps are condensed to one path. In reaction class 12 QOOH is formed by peroxyl radical isomerisation via a 5, 6, 7 or 8 membered ring. The resulting four species and their subsequent oxidation reactions describe the main low temperature reaction paths and are treated separately. Each path consists of the reactions of the primary and secondary isomers which are described above. The linear lumping of the low temperature oxidation pathways is not only a reduction of the mechanism size but a complete reorganisation of the reaction pathways. The new order is based on the number of C atoms between the radical position and the OOH group (which is directly correlated to the ring size of the transition state when QOOH is formed) after the first internal H-atom abstraction replacing the four C7H14OOH(A) isomers in the detailed scheme. The subsequent isomerisation steps of the QOOH species consist of only two species whereas up to six different isomers are treated in the detailed scheme. In total, the number of parallel isomerisation pathways of QOOH species has been reduced from 18 to 8. However deviations are found minimal if the concentration profiles of lumped species are compared to totalised profiles of the corresponding isomers in the detailed mechanism.

Mechanism validation
In this section the mechanism will be validated for different combustion systems. The mechanism has been critically tested against experimental data obtained in shock tube experiments,12–15 plug flow reactors,18,19 jet stirred reactors,16,69 HCCI engine data22 and flame studies.20,21 In the shock tube studies of Horning et al., Smith et al., Ciezki et al. and Fieweger et al. ignition delay times for high and low temperatures and a wide range of pressures have been measured, predictions for the low and medium temperature range are also tested against species and heat release profiles obtained in plug flow and jet stirred reactors at pressures between 3 and 12.5 bar. Additionally, HCCI-engine data is included in the validation procedure because it allows testing ignition under very lean conditions. The high temperature chemistry is tested by flame structure predictions for a fuel rich burner stabilized n-heptane–air flame studied by El Bakali et al.20 Finally flame speeds have been simulated for a wide range of mixture strengths and compared to experiments of Davis and Law.21
Shock tubes
The autoignition of n-heptane can be studied at medium and high temperatures in shock tube experiments. We have used the mechanism assuming constant-volume and homogeneous adiabatic conditions behind the reflected shock wave to examine high temperature shock tube experiments of Horning et al.12 and Smith et al.13 The predicted ignition delay was determined by the evaluation of the CH peak in accordance with the procedure applied in the experiments. An excellent agreement is found for all different mixture strengths and temperatures with the results of Horning et al. and a slightly faster ignition is seen compared to the results of Smith et al. as shown in Fig. 4. The relative reactivity with varying temperature and mixture strength matches the experimental findings in all cases. In the work of Smith et al. a modelling study was included based on the mechanisms developed by Curran et al.9,36 Here only the fuel lean and stoichiometric cases show reasonable agreement between experiments and model predictions while for the fuel rich case the ignition is too fast. Since the n-heptane chemistry of the applied mechanism is similar to the one derived here we relate the improvement mainly to the different base chemistry we use. The predictions with the lumped mechanism, the dotted lines in Fig. 4, show only minor deviations from the detailed ones. A tendency to faster predicted ignition delay times for the fuel lean mixture especially at lower temperatures is observed.
 Fig. 4  Experimental (symbols) and predicted (lines detailed, dotted lumped mechanism) ignition delays for mixtures of 0.4% n-heptane in O2/Ar, p = 1.05 ± 0.1 bar. 
The low and medium temperature autoignition of n-heptane was studied by Ciezki et al.14 and Fieweger et al.15 in shock tube experiments for different mixture strengths (ϕ = 0.5–3), pressures (3–40 bar) and in the temperature range of 600–1300 K.14,15 They determined the ignition delay times and for 40 bar also the times between the shock and the first ignition characterized by a peak in peroxyl radical (CxHyO2) concentrations. We simulate these experiments assuming constant volume. The ignition delay time was determined by the CO2 concentration peak in accordance with the procedure applied in the experiments. In Fig. 5 the results for ϕ = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and pressures between 3 bar and 40 bar are shown. Very good, in some cases almost exact, agreement is found for all conditions. Both the increase in reactivity with rising pressure and fuel mole fraction is excellently captured by the kinetic model. It is noteworthy to state that the ignition timing is matched in the NTC region by the simulations for all experiments. The dotted lines representing calculations performed with the lumped mechanism show only negligible deviations from the predictions with the detailed mechanism.

In Fig. 6 predicted and measured ignition delay times until the first ignition—the occurrence of the cool flame—are shown. As seen in the experiment the sensitivity of the cool flame occurrence on mixture strength is very week. For the fuel lean case at higher temperatures the ignition delay times are predicted slightly too fast, otherwise good agreement for both the detailed and the lumped mechanism are found.

We performed a sensitivity analysis at 750, 950 and 1100 K in the same manner as applied in ref. 9 for both the detailed and the lumped mechanism. Our attention was focused on low temperature n-heptane oxidation kinetics. Therefore we assumed that only those reactions belonging to reaction classes 1–25 are of major importance for the reactivity at low and medium temperature. We multiplied the forward rate coefficients of these reactions by a factor of two and compared the relative change in the ignition delay times. A negative sensitivity coefficient thus means that the overall rate of fuel oxidation is enhanced by the examined reaction. The sensitivity coefficients have been calculated at the same temperatures as in the publication of Curran et al. and we found, as expected, a comparable ranking of sensitive reactions. The reaction classes with the highest sensitivities are displayed in Fig. 7. For example, the reaction class 23, the isomerisation reaction of ketohydroperoxide radicals forming ketohydroperoxide molecules and OH is the most effective reaction connected with the low temperature kinetics in promoting the overall rate of oxidation at 750 and 950 K. For the same temperatures the addition of HO2 to olefins, the reverse reaction of class 20, is very effective in removing HO2 and decelerating the ignition process. A more detailed analysis has been performed with reaction class two, the direct H-atom abstraction from the fuel. Here we discriminated between H-atom abstraction by OH, HO2 and the total abstraction rate. We found that the H abstraction sensitivity is mainly determined by the reaction with HO2 at 950 and 1100 K. Abstraction by OH is only sensitive at 750 K. Curran et al. only investigated the sensitivity of H-atom abstraction by OH and also found only at 750 K a significant sensitivity which is a factor of three higher compared to this study. This effect is reasoned by a higher rate for the competing H abstraction by HO2 applied in the model presented here and some changes in the H2O2, HO2, C2H5O2 and C3H7 + O2 chemistry influencing the decisive OH/HO2 ratio discussed, for example, in ref. 9. The influence of these reactions has been discovered analyzing HCCI experiments. It is generally seen that the sensitivity moves from the low temperature chemistry (classes 10–25) at 750 K to the high temperature chemistry at 1100 K competing at 950 K.

The comparison of sensitivities of reaction classes for the detailed and lumped mechanisms is a direct test how the reactivity of the kinetic scheme is influenced by the reorganisation of the reaction mechanism. Only negligible deviations are found for main sensitive reaction classes demonstrating that not only the overall reactivity but also the class reactivities are maintained after the reduction using chemical lumping. The consequence of these findings is that the structure of the reorganized mechanism is not influenced by the kinetic assumptions for reaction rates in this paper.
A detailed discussion of the main reaction pathways is found in the article by Curran et al. Since the n-heptane oxidation mechanism presented here consists of only a slightly modified chemistry we refer to their paper9 and the discussion therein.
Pressure flow reactor
Flow reactor experiments provide combustion environments that are relatively well characterized because mixing and diffusion effects are of minor influence. However, initial mixing and temperature measurements are still connected with some uncertainty.19 Experimental data obtained in the Princeton variable pressure flow reactor are the reference for the validation of the mechanism derived here. Its setup allows measurements where the residence time of the fuel/oxidizer mixture in the reactor is held constant and the initial temperature is varied18 and vice versa, measurements at constant pressure with varying reaction time.19 Especially the last named setup is a highly sensitive probe for the reactivity of the combustion system since it allows following the ignition process with a much higher time resolution compared to e.g. shock tube experiments. We have considered adiabatic zero dimensional isobaric conditions to perform model predictions for species concentration profiles and heat release for both types of experiments which have not been a test case in the compiling process. The calculations have been carried out with both the detailed and the lumped mechanisms. In Fig. 8 the model predictions for CO and O2 concentration profiles are compared to experimental data obtained at 12.5 bar with initial temperatures between 550 and 850 K. The model shows very good agreement in terms of curvature over the whole temperature range, especially in the NTC region. But a temperature shift of about 30–40 K is observed. The same effect is seen for the measured and simulated heat release (Tend–Tinitial) also illustrated in Fig. 8 where again the curvature is nicely captured by the simulation. The calculations have been performed with a residence time 2.1 s slightly above the experimental conditions of 1.8 s which is discussed below. The resulting profiles using the detailed and the lumped mechanism are in good agreement. A comparable performance is obtained with the mechanism of Curran et al., however curvature features show partially greater deviations but absolute CO concentrations are slightly closer to the experimental values. This observation is not surprising because of the very similar n-heptane chemistry. It is noteworthy to state that we also performed calculations with the updated version of Curran’s mechanism36 not showing this shift but a considerable deviation is found for the ignition delay time predictions for the experiments of Ciezki et al. discussed above. Taking both data sets into account leads seemingly to a conflict of aims which is potentially explained by uncertainties in temperature measurements or by effects of inhomogeneity which is a potential drawback of the plug flow arrangement. Mechanistic problems that appear under high dilutions might be the reason as well. Measurements of species concentration profiles under lean and fuel rich conditions were performed in the same reactor at a constant pressure of 3 bar and constant temperature of 940 K simulated with the final version of the mechanism after the compilation process. The simulations for fuel lean conditions show reasonable agreement with the experimental data (Fig. 9). A time shift of +0.15 s was applied in our calculations. It is the same time shift used in predictions with a semi empirical n-heptane mechanism presented in the same publication. Held et al. used a time shift such that a best match between predicted and measured n-heptane profiles was achieved. The underlying effects are explained by the authors with inhomogeneities due to the mixing having taken place in the start zone of the reactor. These remarks motivated us to enlarge the residence time in our calculations for the experiments with constant residence time discussed above about 10–15%. A positive effect on the agreement in curvature shape was found.

Experimental results (ref. 19, symbols) versus model predictions (lines detailed, dotted lumped mechanism). 
The calculations with the lumped mechanism show a slightly higher reactivity for both lean and fuel rich conditions. This is reasoned by the comparable large time scales of these experiments resulting from the high dilutions. In the log normal plots of the ignition delay times measured in shock tube experiments (Fig. 4 and 5) comparable deviations occur but are not resolved. The plug flow arrangement allows a high time resolution for the ignition process but as a drawback there is a rise in the susceptibility of the results for effects of inhomogeneity like wall reactions or temperature gradients. Stochastical reactor models are candidates for future simulations because they are capable of taking these inhomogeneities into account.
For the experiments with the constant residence time a sensitivity analysis was performed. The sensitivity coefficients were determined in the same way as for the shock tube experiments but here not the ignition delay time was taken as an indicator of reactivity but the time until half of the fuel is consumed. We applied the same temperatures (600, 750 and 800 K) as in the publication of Curran et al. who examined the same experiments. The results are shown in Fig. 10. Under the specific experimental conditions in the flow reactor (for example, a much higher dilution compared to the shock tube experiments) the maximum of the NTC region is found at 730 K compared to 950 K in the shock tube experiments. Moreover, the most effective reaction in promoting fuel consumption is class 22, peroxyalkylhydroperoxide radical formation compared to class 23, the subsequent isomerisation reaction. In general, it is seen that the reactivity is determined by the same reactions as in the shock tube experiments discussed above. In the maximum of the NTC region high and low temperature n-heptane oxidation kinetics have approximately the same influence on fuel consumption representing the transition zone from low to high temperature kinetic control. Comparing sensitivity coefficients of the detailed mechanism with the lumped one again shows that the relative class reactivities are preserved after lumping.

Jet-stirred reactor
Another reactor type suitable to study fuel oxidation is the jet-stirred reactor (JSR). A stirred reactor with a constant in and out stream can be operated under steady state conditions which are characterized by a constant mean residence time of the educts and a constant composition of the out stream mixture. This reactor type is determined by much different boundary conditions compared to shock tubes or flow reactors. Therefore an additional test of model predictions against data from stirred reactor experiments is very useful to avoid compensating shortcomings of experiments by adjusting the chemical model. Dagaut et al. studied the oxidation of n-heptane in a well characterized jet stirred reactor.16,17 The homogeneity of the reactor was controlled and no temperature and concentration gradients were found. Concentration profiles of reactants, final and intermediate products are obtained applying gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis tools. The experiments cover a wide temperature range between 550–1150 K, pressures of 10 and 40 bar and mixture strengths from ϕ = 0.3 to ϕ = 1.5. A high dilution by nitrogen was chosen in order to reduce temperature gradients and heat release in the reaction cell. With the same reactor experiments at 10 bar in the same temperature range with a higher initial n-heptane concentration were conducted by Moréac et al.69 We included major species concentration profiles obtained in this study in our validation procedure in order to test if the effect of the higher fuel partial pressure is captured by the model. The detailed and the lumped mechanisms were used in a straightforward way to calculate the concentration profiles of the fuel and the major species O2, CO, CO2 over the whole temperature range and lean, stoichiometric and fuel rich mixtures. Additionally for the stoichiometric mixture predicted concentration profiles of the important intermediates C2H4, HCHO and 2-5-QO (cyclic ether with the second and fifth carbon atom bonded to the oxygen atom) have been compared with the experimental data. The results are shown in Fig. 11. For a better comparison of the overall reactivity between model and experiment the conversion is calculated from the n-heptane concentrations for different mixture strengths and pressures. The results are presented in Fig. 12.
 Fig. 11  Oxidation of 0.1% n-heptane in O2/N2 in a jet stirred reactor at p = 10 bar, ϕ = 0.5, xO2 = 0.0055 (a), ϕ = 1, xO2 = 0.011 (b), ϕ = 1.5 xO2 = 0.022 (c). Experimental results (ref. 19, symbols) versus model predictions (lines detailed, dotted lumped mechanism) of mole fractions for the educts and major products and some important intermediates (d) for ϕ = 1.0. 
 Fig. 12  Experimental (ref. 19, symbols) and model predicted (lines, dotted lumped mechanism) conversions of 0.1% n-heptane in a jet stirred reactor at p = 10 bar, ϕ = 0.5, 1, 1.5. 
In general, simulations are in good agreement with the experiments for all mixtures. Furthermore the lumped mechanism shows negligible deviations from the detailed one. The experimental O2 concentration profiles are systematically 10–15% too high while the fuel concentration profiles are in good match with the predictions. This is also seen in the conversion profiles (Fig. 12) for the three different mixtures where the relative reactivity of the mixtures is well reproduced by the chemical model. For the CO and CO2 concentration profiles the onset of production leaving the NTC region and the shift in the ratio of concentrations in favour of CO2 with rising temperature is in good agreement with the predictions. But the absolute CO concentration is underpredicted, especially at lower temperatures for the stoichiometric and the fuel rich case for both the mechanism presented here and the mechanism of Curran et al. who tested the stoichiometric experiment at 10 bar, too.
The same trend is found for the experiments performed with a 50% higher initial fuel concentration displayed in Fig. 13. Here above 800 K the simulated concentration profiles of CO and CO2 are closer to the experiment also in terms of absolute mole fractions while around 650 K the CO concentration is still underpredicted. However, the local CO maximum around 640 K is reproduced by the model. The dependence of the overall reactivity of the mixtures on the temperature in terms of conversion can be compared to the shock tube experiments performed in the same temperature range. It is seen that the chemical model predicts for both types of experiments significant points like the local minima in reactivity in the NTC region in good agreement for lean to fuel rich conditions. For the plug flow reactor experiments, a temperature shift of about 35 K is seen which is potentially due to inhomogeneity effects or uncertainties in the temperature measurements.

A sensitivity analysis was also performed for the stoichiometric mixture at temperatures of 600, 730 and 900 K. For the specific conditions of the stirred reactor model we derived the sensitivity coefficients as follows: We calculated the steady state concentrations of the fuel in the out stream with both the original and the modified mechanism where the rate of one reaction class is enhanced by a factor of two. The ratio of the two concentrations as a percentage is the sensitivity coefficient. The results of the sensitivity analysis are displayed in Fig. 14. As already found for the plug flow reactor experiments at low temperatures class 22 is the most sensitive reaction in promoting fuel consumption during a certain residence time whereas the next step, class 23, is most sensitive for the ignition process as we saw in the shock tube experiments. The reaction classes 20, 23, 19 and 12 are the other reactions of the low temperature mechanisms with significant influence on fuel consumption at 600 and 730 K. They show a comparable ranking with the plug flow reactor experiments. An interesting feature of the fuel oxidation under stirred reactor conditions is the influence of reactions class 2. In contrast to the shock tube and flow reactor experiments the reaction of the fuel with OH is the most sensitive H abstraction reaction at both low and high temperatures where it largely determines the reactivity of class 2. Only at 730 K the reaction with HO2 is the dominating H abstraction reaction. This observation underlines the already mentioned importance of the kinetic data of these two H abstraction reactions.

HCCI engine simulations
The detailed and the lumped mechanisms have been further validated against homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine simulations. For these calculations, a zero-dimensional engine model was applied.70 The model compresses the gas to auto-ignition, using temperature and pressure at a certain crank angle degree (CAD) obtained from engine experiments as initial conditions. The output of the model is crank angle resolved species concentrations, in–cylinder pressure, temperature and chemical heat release rates.
The experiments for the validation were taken from a study of Tsurushima et al.22 The engine geometry and details like the initial conditions are given in Table 4.
In HCCI engine cycles the gas mixture passes before ignition the reactive temperature regime between 600 and 1100 K at pressures between 5 and 35 bar. In ref. 22 engine experiments are given for fuel–air equivalence ratios between 0.17 and 0.357. We demonstrate the comparison between engine data and model prediction for ϕ = 0.22 to show that the mechanism is still predictive for these extreme conditions. The results are shown in Fig. 15. The timing and the amount of the first heat release due to low temperature oxidation (cool flame) is in very good agreement with the experiments. The second heat release, due to the oxidation of intermediates accumulated during the low temperature oxidation triggered by the decomposition of H2O2 to OH, appeared almost at the same timing as the experimental data but with a smaller gradient. The main ignition occurs with a bit of a delay of ca. 5 CAD and shows a higher heat release rate compared to the experiment. This can be reasoned by the fact that the homogeneous model calculation is not taking into account any of the mixing effects. As has been shown in Fig. 6 the occurrence of the cool flame is not sensitive to the mixture strength while the main ignition is. Hence small inhomogeneities in the mixture quality mainly effect the second ignition. The very good agreement of the heat release under cool flame conditions demonstrates that the transition of low to high temperature chemistry is very well reproduced by the model. In general, both the detailed and the lumped mechanisms well reproduce the experiments yielding almost identical curves hardly to discriminate.
 Fig. 15  Comparison of the cylinder pressure and the rate of heat release (ROHR) at ϕ = 0.222 between model predictions (lines detailed, dotted lumped mechanism) and experimental data (symbols, ref. 22). Engine data: Bore 135 mm, stroke 140 mm, volume 2004 cm3, rod length 257 mm, compression ratio 15.5, inlet valve closure 146 deg BTDC, intake temperature 323 K, 101.3 kPa. 
We included this engineering related test case in this paper because these engine data obtained at very lean conditions proved very useful to identify key reactions of the low temperature H2/O2 chemistry responsible to trigger the H2O2 decomposition not adequately represented in the base mechanism. The subsequent changes to the base chemistry described in the chemical model section were necessary to achieve agreement for the HCCI simulations and had a significant influence on the overall performance of the mechanism: for example, the good agreement of the model predictions found for the fuel lean case JSR experiments is partially due to these changes. Moreover, the dependence of the mechanism reactivity on the mixture strength is significantly improved compared to the n-heptane mechanism of Curran without major modifications to the low temperature n-heptane oxidation model. In general we think modelling experimental data measured under rather extreme conditions is a suitable approach to reveal weaknesses in a kinetic model often not accessible via a sensitivity analysis for the test parameters of standard experiments. Most mechanisms are developed such that these standard experiments are well reproduced and a sensitivity analysis often tends to show that the set of kinetic parameters is adequately chosen for this purpose.
However, once a mechanism is compiled a sensitivity analysis is very valuable for discriminating the key reactions determining its reactivity and has also been performed for the HCCI experiments. Here the crank angle degree at the time of main ignition is taken as a measure for the reactivity. The ratio of the crank angle of the original and the modified mechanism yields the sensitivity coefficient given as a percentage. The results are displayed in Fig. 16. We see that the reactions of the low temperature mechanism have the highest sensitivity though prior to the main ignition a temperature of above 1000 K is reached. The overall the sensitivity is comparable to shock tube ignition at 750 K in Fig. 7. Thus the formation of reactive intermediates at lower temperatures is essential and very sensitive for the ignition process especially under very fuel lean conditions where unimolecular decompositions are suppressed compared to oxidative reactions. For the HCCI experiment as in the case of the shock tube experiments the onset of ignition is a measure for the reactivity and reaction class 23 is the most sensitive reaction in triggering the main ignition. For the lumped mechanism again only negligible deviations in the class reactivities are found.

Flames
The structure of a laminar premixed fuel-rich n-heptane–air flame studied by El Bakali et al.20 was analyzed. The experimental data of El Bakali et al. comprise only stable species, no radicals were measured because of the applied technique for analysis and calibration (gas chromatography, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of samples). In the following a comparison of predicted and measured species concentration profiles is given. Since the reference flame is a 1 bar flame the reaction zone is limited to only 3 mm. Therefore the small corrections of the burner distance data (1 mm) to account for probe and burner nozzle effects are quite large in relative terms. For the present investigation the energy conservation equation was not solved explicitly but the temperature profiles were extracted from the experimental data. The profile actually used in the calculations is raised by 100 K which is well within the uncertainty of the used temperature diagnostics (Pt–Pt (10% Rh) thermocouple measurement). This leads to better results for the partial equilibrium determined CO/CO2 concentrations in the post flame region and we estimate that the accuracy of the concentration measurements and the thermodynamic data for CO/CO2 are higher compared to the temperature diagnostics. In Fig. 17 the computational input data is displayed.

The simulation of species concentration profiles is another critical test case for both the detailed and the lumped mechanisms. Here the validity of the model is checked for a different combustion process at much higher temperatures. In Fig. 18a the results of model predictions are compared to the experimental data for the major species CO, CO2, H2 and H2O.

Good agreement is found for both the detailed (straight lines) and the lumped mechanisms (dotted lines). The same holds for the five olefins C2H2, C2H4, C3H6, C4H4 and C4H6 displayed in Fig. 18b.
The modelling results show that the flame structure of a fuel rich n-heptane–air flame is predicted in good agreement with experimental data with both the detailed and the lumped mechanisms. Only negligible differences between the detailed and the reduced schemes are observed for major products and intermediates. This is achieved without specific changes for flame modelling to both the C1–C4 base mechanism and the n-heptane oxidation model confirming the comprehensive character of the two databases.
The prediction of n-heptane flame speeds has proved difficult in previous studies. Davis and Law21 measured and simulated n-heptane flame speeds for a wide range of mixture strengths and compared the results to other modelling studies.25,71 They determined the flame speeds by the Princeton Counterflow method which is well established and therefore predictions are compared to their data also in this study. Davis and Law found large deviations especially under fuel rich conditions with all mechanisms tested. Calculations with the mechanism they compiled for flame simulations show nice agreement in terms of curvature but flame speeds were predicted as too slow for stoichiometric and fuel rich conditions. El Bakali and coworkers20 used their model to predict n-heptane flame speeds also with unsatisfying results. In Fig. 19 these modelling results and the experimental data of Davis and Law are compared. We used the model derived here without further adjustments for flame speed predictions. Very good agreement with the experiment was found for both the detailed and the lumped schemes as displayed in Fig. 20.

A sensitivity analysis for the flame speeds at p = 1 bar for fuel lean, stoichiometric and fuel rich mixtures (ϕ = 0.7, 1.0 and 1.4) was performed with the detailed and the lumped mechanism. The results displayed in Fig. 21 show that the most sensitive reactions for all mixtures belong to the base chemistry, especially the H2/O2 and the C1/C2 reactions. Besides the main chain branching reaction  which is the most sensitive reaction for all mixtures the reactions of HCCO and C2H3 with H-atoms are of high sensitivity for stoichiometric and fuel rich conditions.
  
  
For stoichiometric and especially fuel lean mixtures many reactions of OH and HO2 are essential for the combustion process with    being the most sensitive ones. But it is emphasized that the relative sensitivities of all the C1 and C2 reactions listed in Fig. 21 under stoichiometric conditions differ less than 40%. Therefore it is hard to state which are the main flame speed influencing reactions because there are virtually tens of comparatively sensitive reactions in the transition region between fuel lean and rich combustion. However, the sensitivity analysis clearly shows that the good agreement of the flame speed predictions is due the used base chemistry. In ref. 4 it is already discussed that the high temperature kinetic data for 3-CH2 + O2 and the reactions of HCCO in general are essential for simulating the transition from stoichiometric to fuel rich conditions. The change of the absolute rate and the channel branching ratios for 3-CH2 + O2 according to the study of Dembrowsky and Wagner72 significantly improved the flame speed predictions for fuel rich conditions. The new rates also reduced the sensitivity of these reactions which therefore do not appear among the most sensitive reactions in Fig. 21. An evaluation of the kinetic data for the reactions of HCCO, which was critical to improve predictions of species concentration profiles under fuel rich conditions, lead to a new reaction pathway73 for HCCO + O2. This reaction pathway is sensitive for the flame speeds of all mixtures (see Fig. 21) and contributed the close match for flame velocity predictions of the model presented here. This shows that it is useful to accompany a sensitivity analysis by other analysis methods or strategies for improving global reactivity indicators like flame speeds that are determined by a very complex interaction of many species and reactions. For example experiments under rather extreme conditions yield valuable additional information as discussed above and in the next paragraph.

Flame speeds and ignition delays of C1–C4 fuels
To demonstrate that the mechanism derived here preserves the general applicability of the base mechanism and still predicts C1–C4 flame speeds with the same close match with experiments we recalculated flame speeds for all fuels tested in ref. 4. We found even slightly improved agreement especially for propane and propene flame speeds with the new mechanism shown in Fig. 22. This observation seems to us of general importance. Modelling the combustion of certain fuels (here n-heptane) obviously involves more chemistry also relevant for the combustion of other fuels (here C3 flames) as in first place is supposed. This is not surprising considering the complexity of the interacting chemistry and physics in combustion systems and already addressed for example in ref. 74 and 4 where key reactions for C1–C4 flame speed predictions where identified simulating species concentration profiles of fuel rich near sooting C2/C3 flames. It confirms our approach that simulating experiments performed under different, sometimes extreme physical and chemical environments is very helpful to improve the predictivity of a given mechanism.

Conclusions
The present study has compiled a detailed reaction mechanism for n-heptane oxidation based on the broadly validated mechanisms of Hoyermann et al.4 for the high temperature base chemistry and Curran et al. for n-heptane oxidation.9 The compact base chemistry and the limitation of the application of low temperature oxidation pathways to the fuel molecule result in a mechanism of very compact size compared to previously published detailed mechanisms that cover the low temperature regime. Using chemical lumping the complexity has been further reduced. Lumping of heptyl peroxy radicals formed via the same type of transition state leads to a reorganisation of the low temperature reaction mechanism reducing the parallel pathways of isomeric species from 18 to 8. The resulting mechanism gives an advantageous starting point for further model reduction by species removal techniques since the oxidation pathways are largely condensed allowing an easier discrimination of “important” from “unimportant” species. Skeleton mechanisms for n-heptane oxidation of good predictive power with 80 or less species come into reach. The presented lumping method is of general character and can be implemented in automatic mechanism generators. It is suitable for the application for analogous species in oxidation models of different fuels or for different types of reactions.
Both the detailed and the lumped reaction mechanisms have been extensively tested and compared for a variety of experimental data reported by different authors using diverse experimental techniques. Agreement between computed and measured results was generally very good. Differences between the detailed and the lumped models are in general within the accuracy of the detailed mechanism. Progress has been made in predicting successfully flame speeds, flame structure data and ignition delay times in the high temperature regime as well as ignition delay times and species concentration profiles measured under various conditions in the low and medium temperature regime with the same kinetic model. This strongly suggests that the majority of the kinetic data in the mechanism is reasonably correct.
Nevertheless further improvements of the kinetic data of the presented mechanism (rate coefficients, reaction pathways /branching) can be gained especially when new experimental results under extreme combustion conditions are available.

 	Fig. 2  Comparison of predicted concentration profiles with the detailed and the lumped mechanism. The isomers are listed in all figures in order of their maximum concentrations: (a) C7H15 isomers, (b) C7H14OOH (A) isomers, illustration of the significantly lower concentrations of the p-species (c) secondary A isomers, (d) primary A isomers, (e) main products formed in reaction classes 21 and 24. Initial conditions: p = 13.5 bar, ϕ = 1.0 and T = 800 K. The axis for the lumped species is slightly shifted (+0.016 ms) to compensate the small differences in ignition delay time.
