    , Accepted 14th June 2012First published on 14th June 2012AbstractTo increase the open circuit voltage (VOC) of polymer solar cells based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) containing polymers, the weakly electron-withdrawing thiophene-3,4-dicarboxylate unit was introduced into the polymer backbone. Two ester group functionalized DPP containing polymers, PCTDPP with a random structure and PDCTDPP with a regular structure, were designed and synthesized by the Stille coupling reaction. The resulting copolymers exhibit broad and strong absorption bands from 350 to 1000 nm with low optical band gaps below 1.40 eV. Through cyclic voltammetry measurements, it is found that regular PDCTDPP's HOMO energy level is 0.18 V lower than that of the corresponding random PCTDPP (−5.14 eV for PCTDPP and −5.32 eV for PDCTDPP). Preliminary photovoltaic properties of the copolymers blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an electron acceptor were investigated. The PSC based on a PCTDPP:PCBM blend shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 3.52%, with a VOC of 0.66 V, a short circuit current (ISC) of 8.53 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.63. For the PDCTDPP:PCBM blend, the highest VOC reaches a value of 0.84 V, and a final PCE (0.92%) is limited by the poor hole mobility of the active layer.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs), based on conjugated polymer and fullerene mixtures, have recently attracted considerable attention due to their potential advantages of low cost, light weight, flexibility and facile solution processibility.1–5 In the past five years, impressive progress has been made in this field and large area PSC modules have been successfully prepared through full roll-to-roll processing technology.6–13 Soluble poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the most studied materials applicable in the active layer of PSCs due to its availability, and bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices with P3HT as the donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the acceptor can achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 4–5% under the illumination of AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2).14,15 Two main limiting factors are responsible for the low PCE of PSCs. One is that the band-gap (Eg) of P3HT is relatively large (∼1.9 eV) so that it cannot harvest solar radiation located at the near infrared (NIR) region, leading to low short circuit current density (ISC) of the PSCs. The other is the low open-circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs resulting from the relatively high HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy level of P3HT (∼−5.0 eV), because VOC is normally proportional to the difference between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level of the acceptor.16 Therefore, development of new conjugated polymers having both a low band-gap and a deep HOMO energy level becomes a prerequisite to achieve highly efficient PSCs.
Two approaches are the most widely adopted to reduce the band-gap of conjugated polymers. One is to increase the quinoid character of the polymer neutral state, such as in polythieno[3,4-b]thiophene, in which the thiophene ring is fused with another thiophene unit. The other is the introduction of strong push–pull intramolecular interactions into the polymer backbone, such as in the most common donor–acceptor polymers (D-alt-A polymers).17 Following the above two strategies, conjugated polymers based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) have been known as one of the most successful low band-gap polymers applied in optoelectronic devices such as polymer solar cells and field-effect transistors.18–25 The quinoid character of the DPP core, and its electron-deficient nature and good planarity have been exploited for the synthesis of low band-gap D-alt-A polymers that are used in PSCs with high PCEs.26–31 Recently, H. Bronstein et al. synthesized a new DPP containing polymer, poly{3,6-dithieno-[3,2-b]thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-(2H,5H)-dione-co-thiophene}(P1). The obtained copolymer exhibits a very high hole mobility of 1.95 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an excellent photovoltaic property while blended with PC71BM. A PCE value as high as 5.4%, a large ISC of 15 mA cm−2 and a relatively small VOC of 0.58 V were realized.23
The most common way so far to lower the HOMO energy level of DPP containing polymers is by reducing the effective conjugation length to inhibit the delocalization of π-electrons in the polymer main chain, such as by copolymerizing with benzene, fluorene and carbozole units.18,19 But this method often results in a wider bandgap and poorer charge transport properties, which are unfavorable for use in PSCs. It is noted that another simple and efficient method to lower the HOMO energy level of polythiophene derivatives is the incorporation of electron-withdrawing substituents such as ester groups as shown previously.32–38 In this paper, we firstly applied the latter method to the system of DPP containing polymers, trying to gain ideal polymers with both low Eg and a deep HOMO energy level for PSCs. The weakly electron-withdrawing thiophene-3,4-dicarboxylate unit was copolymerized with the dithiophene substituted DPP core through Stille coupling reactions, affording a random copolymer (PCTDPP) and a regular copolymer (PDCTDPP). The thermal stability, optical absorption, and HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the obtained copolymers were fully characterized. A preliminary photovoltaic study of the polymer:PCBM blend was conducted in order to explore their potential applications in PSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of the polymers
The synthetic routes to the monomers and copolymers are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. Thiophene-3,4-dicarboxylate was synthesized from thiophene-3,4-dicarboxylic acid and the alcohol in the presence of trimethylsilyl chloride in high yields. Two octyl chains were introduced onto the thiophene-3,4-dicarboxylate in order to improve the solubility and processibility of the final copolymers. Lithiation and the subsequent stannylation of compound 4 at low temperature in large amounts of solvent afforded monomer 5 with high purity. The random copolymer PCTDPP was synthesized through a Stille coupling reaction of monomer 6, 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene, and monomer 3 in toluene using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst. Similarly, the regular copolymer PDCTDPP was synthesized through a Stille coupling reaction of monomer 5 and monomer 3. The obtained copolymers are soluble in common organic solvents, such as THF, CHCl3, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene.

The 1H NMR spectra of the two copolymers in CDCl3 are quite similar, exhibiting the chemical shift of the thienyl–H next to the DPP core at 8.6–9.1 ppm, overlapping alkoxyl–H and imine–H at 3.7–4.6 ppm, and the other thienyl–H at 6.9–7.8 ppm (see Fig. 1). The molecular weights of the copolymers were determined by GPC with polystyrene as a standard. The weight-average molecular weights (Mw) are 14.3 and 11.4 k with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.8 and 1.4 for PCTDPP and PDCTDPP, respectively. The thermal properties of the polymers were investigated by thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), and their thermograms are depicted in Fig. 2. Both copolymers of PCTDPP and PDCTDPP exhibit good thermal stability, with 5% weight-loss temperatures (Td) at 396 °C and 377 °C under N2 protection, respectively.

Optical properties
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the two copolymers in CHCl3 solutions and in thin films are shown in Fig. 3. Their corresponding optical data are summarized in Table 1. The two copolymers exhibit very broad absorption bands in the visible region and the NIR region. PCTDPP shows a maximal absorption peak (λmax) at 677 nm in CHCl3 solution while λmax of the solid film is located at 728 nm. PDCTDPP shows λmax at 634 nm in CHCl3 solution while that of its thin film is 778 nm. Compared to the solutions, the absorption peaks of the corresponding films of the two copolymers are broadened and exhibit red-shifts (51 and 144 nm for PCTDPP and PDCTDPP, respectively), indicating that good intermolecular interactions and aggregation occur in the solid state. Since the absorption band-edges (λonset) of the two copolymer films extend to 945 and 890 nm, the optical band-gaps (Eoptg) are calculated as 1.31 and 1.39 eV for PCTDPP and PDCTDPP, respectively. We ascribe this to the very strong electron withdrawing character of DPP (A1), thiophene-3,4-dicarboxylate as a weak electron withdrawing unit (A2), and thiophene as an electron donating unit (D). Thus, random PCTDPP is a –(D–A1)m–(D–A2)n– structure and regular PDCTDPP is a –(D–A1–D–A2)n– structure. The relatively smaller Eoptg of PCTDPP mainly originates from the –(D–A1)m– chain segments whose intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interaction is much stronger than that of the –(D–A1–D–A2)n– chain segments in PDCTDPP. Also, two kinds of ICT interactions in PCTDPP synchronously contribute to the photon absorption, leading to a strong optical absorption in the range from 350 nm to 1000 nm, whereas PDCTDPP has a relatively weak optical absorption in the range from 350 nm to 600 nm due to the single ICT interaction.39

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the two copolymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV curves were recorded versus the potential of the SCE, which was calibrated by the ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level). The cyclic voltammogram of the two copolymers is shown in Fig. 4, and the electrochemical data are also summarized in Table 1. From Fig. 4, it is found that the two copolymers both undergo a quasi-reversible redox process. The onset oxidation potential (Eox) of PCTDPP is 0.74 V while the onset reduction potential (Ered) is −0.86 V. The onset oxidation potential (Eox) of PDCTDPP is 0.92 V while the onset reduction potential (Ered) is −0.80 V. Thereby, according to the empirical formula (EHOMO = −Eox + 4.4 eV), the HOMO energy levels of PCTDPP and PDCTDPP can be calculated as −5.14 and −5.32 eV, respectively.40 Similarly, the LUMO energy levels of PCTDPP and PDCTDPP can be calculated as −3.54 and −3.60 eV, respectively. The electrochemical bandgaps of the two polymers (1.60 V and 1.72 V) are both slightly larger than the corresponding optical bandgaps (1.31 V and 1.39 V) probably due to the interfacial barrier for charge injection, and such a phenomenon can be found in the literature.41 Both HOMO energy levels of the copolymers are much lower than that of P3HT (∼−5.0 eV), which is beneficial to achieve high open circuit voltage in PSCs. It is worth noting that EHOMO for PDCTDPP is 0.18 V lower than that of the corresponding random PCTDPP, which is caused by the higher content of electron-withdrawing ester groups in PDCTDPP side chains.

Photovoltaic properties
In order to explore the potentials of the two copolymers in photovoltaics, PSCs were fabricated with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/Al. Dichlorobenzene was chosen as the solvent for device fabrication. Different weight ratios between copolymers and PCBM were explored to prepare PSC devices and we found the best ratio was 1:2. Fig. 5 shows the I–V curves of the best photovoltaic devices under the illumination of AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2). From Fig. 5, it is found that the PCE of the device based on PCTDPP is 3.52%, with a VOC of 0.66 V, an ISC of 8.53 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.63. However the PCE of the device based on PDCTDPP is only 0.92%, with a VOC of 0.84 V, an ISC of 3.17 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.346. The VOC of PDCTDPP device is 0.18 V higher than that of PCTDPP, which is consistent with the CV results, and to the best of our knowledge, the value of 0.84 V is among the highest VOC in all PSCs based on DPP containing polymers. However, compared to the PCTDPP devices, PDCTDPP devices exhibit poorer photovoltaic properties, which is mainly caused by the smaller ISC. We have summarized the photovoltaic data obtained for normal device structures in Table 2 achieved by the same operator in two different laboratories ZJU (China) and DTU (Denmark). It is noticeable that the larger area devices exhibit lower performance in normal device geometry. We ascribe this to film imperfections and ohmic losses for the large area devices.

For polymer photovoltaic devices, the surface morphology and charge carrier mobility of the active layer are very important to the final performance. The surface morphology of the blended films of PCTDPP:PCBM (1:2, w/w) and PDCTDPP:PCBM (1:2, w/w) were observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 6). Both blended films show a quite smooth surface and small phase-separated domains (∼50 nm), implying that the two polymers have a good compatibility with PCBM. We used the space charge limited current (SCLC) method to determine the hole mobilities of the blended films with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer:PCBM(1:2, w/w)/Au. Fig. 7 shows the I–V characteristics of the hole devices based on PCTDPP:PCBM and PDCTDPP:PCBM blended films. The hole mobilities of the blended films were estimated according to the equation:42  where V is the applied voltage, J is the current density, εr and ε0 are the relative dielectric constant of the organic layer and the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), respectively, μ is carrier mobility and L is the thickness of the organic layer. The hole mobilities of PCTDPP:PCBM and PDCTDPP:PCBM blended films were estimated as 8.3 × 10−4 and 6.9 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Due to the reduction of steric hindrance caused by adding two additional thiophene units to the polymer backbone, the PCTDPP:PCBM blended film showed a much higher hole mobility and thus a better balance of hole and electron transport than the PDCTDPP:PCBM blended film, which were responsible for the higher ISC and PCE.43 The above phenomena indicate that the molecular structure of the polymers, especially the regular PDCTDPP, would require redesign such as with other alkyl chains in order to achieve higher mobility and better photovoltaic performance.

Conclusion
Two new ester group functionalized DPP containing polymers, random PCTDPP and regular PDCTDPP, were prepared by Stille coupling reactions. Both copolymers show a broad absorption range in the visible region and NIR region, a relatively deep HOMO energy level, and good thermal stability. The best performance for PSCs made from the blend of PCTDPP and PCBM exhibit a PCE value of 3.5% with a VOC of 0.66 V, an ISC of 8.53 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.63. A high VOC up to 0.84 V is achieved in the PSC based on the PDCTDPP:PCBM blend as a result of the deep HOMO energy level (−5.32 eV) of the polymer material.
Experimental section
Instruments

1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker DMX-500 nuclear resonance spectroscope. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer. Mass spectra were obtained on a VG 70-SE MS spectroscope under the electron impact (EI) mode. The molecular weight of the polymers was determined on a Waters 1525/2414 gel permeation chromatography (GPC) device in THF solution, and polystyrene was used as a standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves were measured on a WCT-2 thermal balance. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was done on a CHI600A electrochemical workstation with a Pt disk coated by a polymer film, a Pt plate, and the standard calomel electrode (SCE) as working electrode, counter electrode, and reference electrode respectively, in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) CH3CN solution.
Materials
All reagents, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from Aldrich, Acros, and TCI Chemical Co. and used as received. All the solvents were freshly distilled prior to use. 2,5-Bis(2-ethylhexy)-3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (4) and 3,6-bis(2-bromothien-5-yl)-2,5-di(2-ethylhexyl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (6) were synthesized according to the reported procedures.18,19
Photovoltaic device fabrication and characterization
PSCs were fabricated with indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates in the normal geometry. The ITO glass was pre-cleaned and PEDOT:PSS [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)] (Baytron P 4083, Germany) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 60 s on the ITO substrate. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was about 30 nm. Then, a 20 mg mL−1 solution of polymer and PCBM (1:2, w/w) in ortho-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) was spin-cast at 1000 rpm for 30 s onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The thickness of the photoactive layer was in the range 50–70 nm (calibrated by an Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer). Lastly, a 100 nm thick Al film was deposited onto the photoactive layer under vacuum of ∼4 × 10−4 Pa. The experiments were carried out at two different locations: ZJU (China) and DTU (Denmark). The active area employed at ZJU was 9 mm2. I–V characteristics of the devices in the dark and under illumination of a Thermal Oriel solar simulator with AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) were recorded on a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Keithley 2400-SCS), and the light intensity was calibrated with a photovoltaic (PV) silicon reference cell. At DTU the active area employed was 25 mm2 and illumination was carried out under a Class AAA solar simulator using bolometric calibration of the intensity to 100 mW cm−2.
Synthesis
The general synthetic routes toward the monomers and the copolymers are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2, respectively. The detailed synthetic processes are as follows.

Dioctyl thiophene-3,4-dicarboxylate (2). 
A suspension of thiophene-3,4-dicarboxylic acid (1) (3.0 g, 17.46 mmol) in 30 mL of anhydrous 1-octanol was purged with N2 for 10 min and trimethylsilyl chloride (8.89 mL, 69.84 mmol) was added dropwise via a syringe. The mixture was warmed and stirred at 65 °C for 24 h. The reaction was quenched with 30 mL of cold water and extracted with CH2Cl2 three times. The organic extraction was washed with water twice and then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After the removal of the solvent and 1-octanol under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with a mixture of CH2Cl2–petroleum ether (2:1) as eluent to give the title compound as a light yellow oil (6.2 g, yield 90%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 7.82 (s, 2H), 4.26 (t, 4H), 1.68–1.77 (m, 4H), 1.22–1.42 (m, 20H), 0.85–0.91 (m, 6H). 13C NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 163.38, 133.94, 131.60, 65.72, 31.99, 29.45, 29.39, 28.80, 26.16, 22.83, 14.27.

Dioctyl 2,5-dibromothiophene-3,4-dicarboxylate (3). 
To a 250 mL flame-dried two-necked flask was added compound 2 (10 mmol, 3.96 g) and glacial acetic acid (75 mL). Then Br2 (2.56 mL, 50 mmol) was added dropwise to the solution at room temperature. The mixture was warmed and stirred at 60 °C for 15 h. After the reaction was completed, an aqueous solution of Na2SO3 was then added to remove the unreacted Br2 and the mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 three times. The organic extraction was washed with water twice and then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After the removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with a mixture of CH2Cl2–petroleum ether (1:1) as eluent to give the title compound as a light yellow oil (2.87 g, yield 52%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 4.31 (t, 4H), 1.75 (m, 4H), 1.24–1.47 (m, 20H), 0.87–0.94 (m, 6H). 13C NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 161.79, 134.16, 115.75, 66.41, 31.99, 29.40, 29.38, 28.69, 26.12, 22.85, 14.27.

2,5-Bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-di(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (5). 
Compound 4 (0.7 g, 1.33 mmol) was dissolved in 40 mL of anhydrous THF under N2 protection. The solution was cooled down to −78 °C and 5.0 mL freshly prepared LDA (lithium diisopropylamine) (4.0 mmol, 0.8 M in THF) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred at this temperature for 1 h and allowed to warm to −20 °C over 3 h, at which point it was stirred for an additional 2 h. Then the mixture was cooled to −78 °C and trimethyltin chloride solution (4.7 mL, 4.7 mmol, 1 M in THF) was added rapidly. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. The reaction was quenched with 30 mL of cold water and extracted with CH2Cl2 three times. The organic extraction was washed with water twice and then dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. After the removal of the solvent under vacuum, the residue was dissolved in hexane and quickly passed through a short alumina column pretreated with triethylamine to give the title compound as a viscous liquid (1.06 g, yield 94%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 8.96 (d, 2H), 7.31 (d, 2H), 4.04 (d, 4H), 1.86–1.95 (m, 2H), 1.15–1.34 (m, 48H), 0.78–0.88 (m, 12H), 0.43 (s, 18H). 13C NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 162.06, 146.12, 136.38, 135.48, 130.74, 128.64, 107.44, 46.02, 39.29, 28.83, 25.83, 23.75, 23.33, 14.23, 10.81, −7.86.

PCTDPP. 
The synthesis of the copolymers was carried out by the well-known palladium catalyzed Stille coupling reaction. 2,5-Bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (0.41 g, 1.0 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (34 mg, 0.03 mmol), monomer 6 (0.34 g, 0.5 mmol), and monomer 3 (0.28 g, 0.5 mmol) were dissolved in degassed anhydrous toluene (20 mL). The reaction mixture was refluxed under N2 for 48 h, and was cooled to room temperature and poured into 200 mL methanol. After precipitation, the crude product was subjected to Soxhlet extractions with methanol, acetone, hexane, and CHCl3 in succession. The polymer was obtained as a dark solid from the CHCl3 fraction by rotary evaporation. PCTDPP (yield 42%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3, δ/ppm): 8.90–9.05 (br, 2H), 6.95–7.75 (br, 6H), 4.22–4.53 (br, 4H), 3.84–4.22 (br, 4H), 1.86–2.02 (br, 2H), 1.56–1.76 (br, 4H), 1.15–1.50 (br, 36H), 0.78–1.02 (br, 18H). GPC: Mw = 14.3 k, Mn = 5.1 k, PDI = 2.8. TGA: Td = 396 °C. Anal. Calcd for (C60H76N2O6S5)n: C, 66.54; H, 7.02; N, 2.59. Found: C, 65.93; H, 6.94; N, 2.97%.


PDCTDPP. 
Monomer 5 (0.85 g, 1.0 mmol), monomer 3 (0.55 g, 1.0 mmol), and Pd(PPh3)4 (35 mg, 0.03 mmol) were dissolved in degassed anhydrous toluene (20 mL). The reaction mixture was refluxed under N2 for 48 h, and was cooled to room temperature and poured into 200 mL methanol. After precipitation, the crude product was subjected to Soxhlet extractions with methanol, acetone, hexane, and CHCl3 in succession. The polymer was obtained as a dark solid (yield 36%) from the CHCl3 fraction by rotary evaporation. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 8.67–9.02 (br, 2H), 6.94–7.73 (br, 2H), 3.71–4.47 (br, 10H), 1.76–2.06 (br, 2H), 0.98–1.51 (br, 48H), 0.71–0.95 (br, 12H).
