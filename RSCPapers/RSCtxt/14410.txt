    , Accepted 7th December 2018First published on 2nd January 2019AbstractInnovative bimetallic MOFs offer more possibilities to further tailor the properties of MOFs, which have attracted great attention for wide applications. However, it is still a great challenge to rationally design bimetallic MOFs due to the lack of a tunable and reasonable hybrid structure architecture. Herein, a new series of bimetallic metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable pillar linkers were prepared by a one-step synthesis method. These bimetallic MOFs retain the same crystal structure when the mole fraction (based on metal) of the two metals changes from 0 to 1 and both metal ions occupy random nodal positions. The incorporation of a second metal cation has a large influence on the intrinsic properties (e.g. thermal stabilities and band gaps) of the MOFs. Furthermore, these bimetallic MOFs were used as self-sacrificial templates to prepare bimetal oxide catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After pyrolysis, a porous and hierarchical honeycomb-like structure with carbon network covered (bi)metal oxides is formed. Among all the bimetallic MOF-derived catalysts, CoNi1@C showed the best performance for the OER with the lowest Tafel slopes (55.6 mV dec−1) and overpotentials (335 mV on a glassy carbon electrode and 276 mV on Ni foam) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is higher than those of state-of-the-art Co–Ni mixed oxide catalysts derived from MOFs for the OER. Our results indicate that the incorporation of a second metal ion is a promising strategy to tailor the properties of MOFs. More importantly, this new bimetallic MOF family with tunable linkers is expected to serve as a flexible assembly platform to offer broad possibilities for practical applications of MOFs.
1. Introduction
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), constructed by coordination bonds between metal ions (or clusters) and various organic linkers, show tunable pore sizes and components, highly ordered porous crystalline structures, and high surface areas. These characteristics make MOFs promising candidates for a wide range of applications, such as gas separation, gas storage, sensing, catalysis, energy storage and conversion, and versatile precursors for the preparation of nanomaterials.1–4
In order to further optimize the structure and properties, the incorporation of a second metal into the framework (i.e. bimetallic MOFs) is being explored recently.5 The presence of a second metal in the framework changes the intrinsic properties of the MOFs significantly. For example, by incorporation of different metal ions into the structure of MOF-74, the resulting bimetallic MOF-74 showed very different gas adsorption and catalytic activity compared with the monometallic MOF-74.6–9 In addition, the electronic properties of MOFs can be tailored by metal node engineering, as shown in recent work of Dolgopolova et al.10 The stability, luminescence and magnetic properties of these bimetallic frameworks have also been investigated.11–19 On the other hand, bimetallic MOFs show promise as self-sacrificial templates for preparing hybrid nanomaterials, which play an essential role in sensors, catalysts, and energy storage and conversion applications. Huang and co-workers prepared porous ZnO/ZnFe2O4/C octahedra with hollow interiors by using FeIII modified MOF-5 as the self-sacrificial template. The resulting material shows good lithium-storage performance.20 Recently, Ni–Co-mixed-oxide nanocages (prepared by using Prussian-blue-analogs)21 and carbon-coated CoxNi1−x@CoyNi1−yO (prepared using MOF-74)22 were successfully synthesized by using bimetallic MOFs as the self-sacrificial templates. The resulting Co–Ni catalysts were used for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is currently a major bottleneck for electrochemical water splitting.23 To generate a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotentials for the Ni–Co-mixed-oxide nanocages and carbon-coated CoxNi1−x@CoyNi1−yO were 380 mV and 520 mV, respectively. Meanwhile, other types of hybrid nanomaterials were also successfully prepared using bimetallic MOFs, such as core–shell structures and bimetallic nanoparticles.24–30
On the other hand, there are two general methods to prepare bimetallic MOFs: the one-step method and the post-treatment method. Although the post-treatment method can be used to prepare bimetallic MOFs, it is difficult to control the molar ratios of the two metals or to obtain a uniform random distribution of the two metal ions. Because of the small pore size and the large steric hindrance within MOFs, the exchange of metal ions needs to overcome large kinetic barriers and diffusion problems, leading to partial exchange in some cases. Moreover, when a second metal is introduced into a pristine MOF, the overall morphology of the MOF can change or even collapse.31,32 Until now, the one-step synthesis method has been the most effective way to achieve bimetallic MOFs. Unfortunately, bimetallic MOFs often have fragile frameworks as well as unpredictable topologies and functions after the introduction of new metal nodes. Some MOFs can retain their original structure when pristine MOFs are partially replaced by a second metal ion. For example, Botas et al. reported that in the MOF-5 framework structure, only a limited amount of Zn can be substituted by Co2+ (no more than 25% of the total metal mole content).33 A similar situation happens with HKUST-1 and ZIF-8/ZIF-67.34–38 Recently, some successful cases of bimetallic MOFs were reported by using Prussian-blue (PB) or Prussian-blue-analogs (PBAs) as prototypical MOFs, such as Co–Ni, Co–Fe, Co–Zn, Co–Mn, Fe–Mn and Fe–Ni.39–46 However, the poor possibility of controlling the pore size and linkers in PB and PBA is their key disadvantage. Compared to other MOFs, the most promising candidate is MOF-74. It can be easily designed for different Zn–Co mole fractions based on metal (from 0 to 1) by the one-step synthesis method.6 Similarly, CoMg-MOF-74 and NiMg-MOF-74 have been synthesized successfully as well.47 Interestingly, the pore size of MOF-74 can be precisely controlled from 1.4 to 9.8 nm by changing the number of phenylene rings in dioxidoterephthalate.48 However, further modifications are limited by the type of linker, which hinders the potential applications of the MOF-74 family. Therefore, in order to investigate a broad range of possibilities for advanced applications of bimetallic MOFs, it would be advantageous to find an appropriate prototypical MOF that can serve as a flexible assembly platform.
Herein, we choose a benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (BTC) linker to form well-defined, two-dimensional (2D) planar layers with metal ions. By tailoring the pillars between the 2D layers, a series of bimetallic MOFs were successfully synthesized by the one-step synthesis method with different types of linkers. The chemical component and structure of these bimetallic MOFs can be easily tailored by the pillar-linkers. These bimetallic MOFs keep their structure when the mole fraction (calculation based on metal only) of the two metals changes from 0 to 1. Additionally, the properties of the resulting MOFs (such as thermal stabilities and band gaps) change greatly with incorporation of secondary metal nodes into the frameworks. Subsequently, different CoNi-BTC-bipy bimetallic MOFs were used as self-sacrificial templates to synthesize catalysts for the OER. Pyrolysis led to the formation of carbon–metal oxide (or dual metal oxide) hybrid materials. Among all the bimetallic MOF-derived catalysts, CoNi1@C showed the lowest overpotentials for the OER (335 mV on a rotating disk electrode and 276 mV on Ni foam) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is lower than any value reported in literature for MOF-derived Co–Ni mixed oxide catalysts.
2. Results and discussion
Benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate (BTC) linker based bimetallic MOFs have been successfully prepared by the one-step synthesis method. The coordination environment of the metal center for these two kinds of bimetallic MOFs is the same (Fig. 1), where the nickel(II) or cobalt(II) center is bound by three BTC units with one bidentate carboxylic group and two monodentate carboxylic groups, which form a well-defined two-dimensional (2D) layer with honeycomb pores. The free carbonyls in the monodentate carboxylic groups are further bonded to a proton via hydrogen bonding interactions, forming an overall neutral framework along the ab-plane. The polar positions of the nickel(II) or cobalt(II) center are occupied by 4,4′-bipyridine along the c axis to form a 3D framework. In order to prove that this new family of bimetallic MOFs can be further tailored using a ‘‘pillaring’’ strategy, a similar series of bimetallic MOFs based on DMF pillars were successfully prepared by the same method. The details of the basic characterization techniques (such as XRD, SEM and EDS) are shown in Fig. S1 and S2.† In this work, the bimetallic MOFs based on 4,4′-bipyridine are chosen as model MOFs for further study.

The crystalline structures of these synthesized MOFs are characterized by powder XRD (Fig. 2a). The powder XRD patterns of all samples show identical characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ ≈ 7.8°, 10.6°, 15.6° and 18.5°, which match well with the simulated patterns found in the literature.49 With the incorporation of a second metal into the frameworks, the crystal structure can be maintained even when the molar ratio of the two metals changes from 0:1 to 1:0. The metal contents (Co and Ni) in the prepared MOFs were determined by means of ICP-OES analysis (Fig. S15†). With increasing concentration of Ni in the starting solution, the content of Ni in the MOF structure increases but the increase is not linear. This is caused by the different coordinating ability of Co2+ and Ni2+ towards the ligand.49 The presence of a second metal in the MOFs was confirmed by diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. 2). In all cases, the UV-Vis spectra are consistent with an octahedral coordination sphere for Co2+ and Ni2+. Indeed, the absorption bands at 450–550 nm and 650–670 nm, detected in the spectra of these MOFs, agree very well with the d–d transitions of Co2+ and Ni2+ in an octahedral coordination sphere, respectively.9 The intensity changes of these absorption bands correspond to changes of the Co/Ni ratio in the prepared bimetallic MOFs, matching the changing content of Co and Ni precursors in the synthesis solution. These results indicate the bimetallic nature of these MOF materials. The band gaps of these MOFs were estimated by a plot of vs. energy37,38,50,51 from UV-Vis data for all samples (Fig. S3†). From the tangent lines in these plots, the band gaps of Co-MOF, CoNiBMMOF-1, CoNiBMMOF-2, CoNiBMMOF-3 and Ni-MOF were found to be 1.61 eV, 1.72 eV, 1.79 eV, 1.82 eV and 2.4 eV, respectively. Interestingly, the synthesized bimetallic MOFs also display evident color changes, depending on the ratio of the two metals (Fig. S4†). This tunable property of the band gaps of bimetallic MOFs may also be promising for photocatalysis.

In order to prove the uniform distribution of both metals inside the bimetallic MOFs, the relative metal element contributions of different bimetallic MOFs were analyzed by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) coupled with wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS). All the samples showed a similar hexagonal morphology (Fig. 3). Moreover, the results of Co–Ni elemental relative composition mapping suggest a fairly homogeneous distribution of Co and Ni throughout the hexagonal MOF sheets. The hexagonal sheets show a higher Co concentration than Ni, similar concentrations for both Co and Ni and a lower Co concentration than Ni for CoNiBMMOF-1, CoNiBMMOF-2 (c) and CoNiBMMOF-3, respectively (Fig. 3b–d). These results are in good agreement with the ICP-OES analysis, demonstrating that these bimetallic MOFs can form solid-solution type crystals over the whole concentration range.

Determination of thermal stabilities and decomposition temperatures of different MOFs was carried out via thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere. There are two main weight loss events during pyrolysis for all samples (Fig. S5†). The first one corresponds to the release of guest molecules (such as ethanol and DMF). The second event is likely attributed to the onset of the decomposition of the framework. The decomposition temperatures are 300 °C, 419 °C, 409 °C, 412 °C and 428 °C for Co-MOF, CoNiBMMOF-1, CoNiBMMOF-2, CoNiBMMOF-3 and Ni-MOF, respectively.
When Ni is added to the Co-MOF, the thermal stability of the MOFs increases significantly due to the higher coordination ability of Ni2+ than Co2+.14,49 Moreover, Co2+ can be easily oxidized to Co3+ at a relatively low temperature.33 After pyrolysis, all the samples retain their hexagonal morphology (Fig. S6–S10†). At high magnification, a porous honeycomb-structure can be clearly observed, caused by the decomposition of the organic linkers. EDS confirmed that the different MOF derived catalysts contain C (originating from the organic linkers), O (from the formed metal oxide) and M (Co or Ni). The ratios of Co vs. Ni in the pyrolyzed MOFs are similar to those of the pristine MOFs. All samples were examined by XRD to confirm the crystalline phase (Fig. 4b). The identified diffraction peaks of Ni@C and Co@C can be well indexed to NiO (JCPDS 65-2901) and Co3O4 (JCPDS 43-1003) with cubic structures, respectively. It is worth mentioning that for the bimetallic samples, the presence of the spinel structure of NiCo2O4 (JCPDS 20-0781) could also be possible. For both the high Co or Ni ratio samples (i.e. CoNi1@C or CoNi3@C), the spinel phase dominates the crystalline phase. In addition, the coexistence of diffraction peaks of NiO and Co3O4 for CoNi2@C implies the formation of NiO and Co3O4 composites.

Furthermore, the chemical composition and valence state of Co and Ni are investigated by XPS measurements. The full scan survey XPS spectra of different catalysts in the region of 0–1000 eV (Fig. S11†) show evident C, O, Ni and Co peaks. The detailed chemical compositions based on full scan survey XPS spectra are summarised in Table S1.† Additionally, the chemical states of Ni and Co in the catalysts were explored using the high-resolution XPS spectra of Co 2p and Ni 2p (Fig. 5). All cobalt-containing samples exhibit similar results. The binding energies of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 (Fig. 5) show two spin–orbit doublets (corresponding to Co2+ and Co3+) at around 780.1 eV and 795.4 eV, respectively, with a spin energy difference of around 15.3 eV, indicating the presence of mainly the Co3O4 phase. The weak shake-up satellite peaks of Co 2p spectra further reveal that the dominant phase is Co3O4.52 In the spectra of Ni 2p, two pairs of spin–orbit doublets and two shake-up satellites can be clearly observed. More specifically, the peaks at 874.3 and 856.3 eV correspond to Ni3+, while the peaks at 872.5 and 854.6 eV can be attributed to Ni2+. For CoNi2@C, CoNi3@C and Ni@C, NiO is the dominant phase. Interestingly, CoNi1@C shows the opposite results with Ni3+ as the dominant phase, which is probably because Co3O4 can induce the formation of Ni3+ because in the presence of a high amount of cobalt, the Ni3+ valence state can be stabilized.53 This also implies the likely formation of a Ni3O4–Co3O4 solid solution at the calcination temperature of 500 °C.53

General HAADF STEM, TEM and HRTEM micrographs and EELS chemical composition maps of all the samples are shown in Fig. 6, 7 and S12, S13.† The Co3O4 nanocrystals derived from the Co-MOFs (Co@C) are present as hexagonal-shaped nanostructures with a size of around 20–40 nm (Fig. 6a). In addition, according to the HRTEM images, the Co3O4 nanocrystals derived from Co-MOFs show good crystallinity. A magnified image of the orange squared region and its corresponding power spectrum reveal that the selected nanocrystal structure is in agreement with the cubic Co3O4 phase (space group Fd3mz) with a = b = c = 0.806 nm. Based on the crystalline domain shown in Fig. 6a, the Co3O4 lattice fringe distances were measured to be 0.249 nm, 0.204 nm and 0.244 nm, respectively, with crystal plane angles of either 26.83° or 51.92°, which could be interpreted as the cubic Co3O4 phase that is visualized along its [01] zone axis. These results agree with XRD data. Similarly, the pure Ni-MOF derived catalyst (Ni@C) is in line with the NiO cubic phase (space group Fm3m) with a = b = c = 0.420 nm (Fig. 6c) and with a smaller particle size (13–40 nm). The corresponding NiO lattice fringe distances were measured to be 0.209 nm, 0.242 nm and 0.238 nm, with crystal plane angles of 55.77 and 126.90° which could be interpreted as the cubic NiO phase, visualized along its [10] zone axis. For the bimetal oxide catalyst of CoNi1@C (Fig. 6b), a small amount of Ni doping decreases the particle size compared to Co@C and leads to particle sizes similar to Ni@C. The corresponding power spectrum reveals that the selected nanocrystal structure corresponds to the NiCo2O4 cubic phase (space group Fd3mz) with a = b = c = 0.81140 nm, which further confirms the formation of a Ni3O4–Co3O4 solid solution. Based on the crystalline domain in Fig. 6b, the NiCo2O4 lattice fringe distances were measured to be 0.243 nm, 0.459 nm and 0.233 nm, respectively, at crystal plane angles of 58.37° or 116.59°, which could be attributed to the cubic NiCo2O4 phase, measured to be 0.243 nm, 0.459 nm and 0.233 nm, respectively, at crystal plane angles of 58.37° or 116.59°, which could be attributed to the cubic NiCo2O4 phase, visualized along its [11] zone axis. On the other hand, it is difficult to distinguish the mixed phase for CoNi2@C and CoNi3@C due to the uniform overlap. Nevertheless, all these results are in excellent agreement with the XRD data. The EELS maps (Fig. 7, S12 and S13†) further reveal the chemical composition of these nanoparticles. Firstly, the mapping images display the existence of M (Co or Ni), O and C elements in these nanoparticles derived from different MOF samples. The elemental maps clearly confirm that C is mainly concentrated on the exterior of the nanostructures for all samples, suggesting the formation of a core–shell structure. These metal oxide particles are connected by a carbon net, which could impart a high electronic conductivity to the catalyst. Moreover, the mapping images display the uniform distribution of Ni and Co for CoNi3@C (Fig. S12†). Surprisingly, CoNi1@C and, in particular, CoNi2@C show an uneven distribution of Ni and Co as determined from the Ni–Co elemental mapping (Fig. 7 and S13†), which could be caused by the different diffusion coefficients of Co and Ni in the Ni–Co system during pyrolysis. A similar phenomenon has been discussed in detail by Han et al.54

To explore the porous structure of the resulting catalyst, the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms and pore size distributions (based on the density functional theory method with a slit pore model) of the different catalysts are measured (Fig. S14†). All the adsorption–desorption isotherms exhibit a typical type II curve with a small H3 hysteresis loop in the P/P0 range of 0.8–1.0, indicating the co-existence of large mesopores and small macropores. The BET specific surface areas of Co@C, CoNi1@C, CoNi2@C, CoNi3@C and Ni@C samples are found to be 22.5, 33.7, 29.0, 28.9 and 36.6 m2 g−1, respectively. With a small amount of Ni doping, the specific surface area of CoNi1@C increases considerably compared to pure Co-MOF derived materials, which is attributed to the decrease of the particle size as proved by TEM results. The pore-size distribution of CoNi2@C, CoNi3@C and Ni@C ranges from 40 nm to more than 100 nm, which is dominated by small macropores. Co@C and CoNi1@C display a broader pore-size distribution with smaller pore sizes and more mesopores, which range from 20 to more than 100 nm. These hierarchical porous structures would be beneficial for the transport of electrolyte ions onto the surface of the active material and facilitate gas bubble dissipation ability.55–59
Electrochemical water splitting is a promising strategy for renewable energy conversion and storage, which combines the OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the sluggish nature of the OER greatly impedes large-scale applications of electrochemical water splitting. Therefore, the catalytic performance of the as-prepared catalysts for the OER was explored by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) (Fig. 8). A precious metal catalyst IrO2 was also tested as a comparison under the same conditions. Compared to the bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE), all catalysts show obvious catalytic activity for the OER. The on-set overpotentials of different catalysts were 0.309 V, 0.263 V, 0.283 V, 0.293 V, 0.298 V and 0.270 V for Co@C, CoNi1@C, CoNi2@C, CoNi3@C, Ni@C and IrO2 catalysts, respectively (Fig. 8). Among these catalysts, CoNi1@C and IrO2 have the lowest on-set overpotentials. The OER kinetics of the catalysts was estimated from Tafel plots. A smaller Tafel slope indicates more favorable OER kinetics of the catalysts. The Tafel plots corresponding to Fig. 8a are shown in Fig. 8b. The Tafel slopes of Co@C, CoNi1@C, CoNi2@C, CoNi3@C, Ni@C and IrO2 catalysts are 41.8, 55.6, 48.1, 57.3, 63.2 and 86.8 mV dec−1, respectively, indicating that the OER was kinetically faster on the MOF-derived catalysts, especially for the Co@C catalyst. The overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is chosen as another key parameter to evaluate the activity of OER catalysts because this current density matches that of a solar water-splitting device with 12.3% efficiency.60 Even though IrO2 has a low on-set overpotential, it has the highest overpotential (0.401 V) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 because of the high Tafel slope. Among all the MOF-derived catalysts, CoNi1@C shows the lowest overpotential (0.335 V) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which is attributed to the combination of a low on-set overpotential and low Tafel slope.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data are recorded in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at η = 380 mV with an amplitude of 5 mV, where Z′ and Z′′ are the real and imaginary parts of the impedance, respectively. The data were fitted adequately by a modified Randles' equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. S15.† The intersection of the plots on the real axis in the higher frequency region represents the equivalent series resistance (Rs), which includes the electrolyte resistance, the contact resistance and the intrinsic resistance of the electrode. The diameter of the semi-circle represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct). A lower Rct corresponds to a faster charge transfer process.61,62 Using the equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. S15,† the fitting results for EIS measurements of different catalysts are obtained (Table S2†). Among these catalysts, CoNi1@C exhibited the lowest Rct resistance (3.4 Ω), implying its fast charge transfer process and thus favorable electrocatalytic activity for the OER.
In order to increase the surface area of the electrode, nickel foam was chosen as a substrate to load the catalysts in a three-electrode system for electrochemical polarization studies (Fig. 9a). Both IrO2 and CoNi1@C exhibit a significant enhancement of OER catalytic performance compared to GC based samples. Particularly, CoNi1@C displays an overpotential of as low as 276 mV on Ni foam at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9a and Table S3†), which is higher than those of state-of-the-art Co–Ni mixed oxide catalysts derived from MOFs for the OER. At an overpotential of 400 mV (i.e. at a potential of 1.63 V vs. RHE), the current density of the CoNi1@C covered electrode (197 mA cm−2) is 3.6 times that of the IrO2 covered electrode (55 mA cm−2) (Fig. 9a).

Support: Ni foam; loading of the catalyst: 3 mg cm−2. (d) Durability test at a constant current density of 20 mA cm−2 for the single electrolyzer cell over 48 h. The inset shows a photograph of the electrolyzer cell system during water electrolysis in 1 M KOH to generate oxygen gas (left) and hydrogen gas (right). 
In addition, a higher pyrolysis temperature has been explored for CoNi1@C. With the increase of temperature, the catalytic performance for the OER slightly decreased due to the decrease of the surface area (Fig. S16†), which could be caused by the increase of the particle size with a higher pyrolysis temperature.63 These results are in agreement with previous studies for MOF-derived materials.64–66 Chronopotentiometric curves of CoNi1@C at different current densities (from 10 to 100 mA cm−2) and chronopotentiometric durability tests at a constant current density of 20 mA cm−2 were recorded (Fig. 9b). CoNi1@C exhibits excellent durability at large current densities (e.g. 100 mA cm−2) over a long time (e.g. 48 h), which could be associated with the thin carbon shell of the CoNi1@C catalyst. Obviously, the high catalytic activity of CoNi1@C for the OER is promising for electrochemical water splitting.
Furthermore, while the Pt/C catalyst still greatly surpasses all other kinds of catalysts for the HER, in this study, the Pt/C catalyst and CoNi1@C catalyst were chosen as the catalysts for the cathode and the anode, respectively, to establish a single electrolyzer cell. At current densities of 10, 20 and 50 mA cm−2, the cell voltages are 1.53 V, 1.58 V and 1.66 V, respectively (Fig. 9c). In addition, the electrolyzer based on the Pt/C catalyst and CoNi1@C catalyst exhibits excellent stability over 48 h during the electrolysis tests (Fig. 9d).
After the stability test, the chemical composition and morphology are explored via TEM and EELS mapping. Compared with the catalyst of CoNi1@C before the test, no distinct change in the morphology can be observed, which could benefit from a carbon shell network of CoNi1@C. Fig. S17† shows the EELS chemical composition maps obtained from the red squared region in the HAADF STEM micrograph. As can be seen in the maps, the region of interest contains information about a few nanostructures. Firstly, the mapping images display the existence of Ni, Co, O and C in the nanostructures present in the sample. There are no other possible contamination elements that can be detected. Then the same results of metal elements are further confirmed by WDS (detection limit can reach the ppm level and around 0.05 wt%)67 as shown in Fig. S18.† However, the increase of Ni content can be clearly observed, compared with CoNi1@C before the test, which probably comes from anodic dissolution of Ni foam. In order to prove this hypothesis, the same stability test was carried out using the substrate of carbon paper. After the stability test, CoNi1@C on the carbon paper exhibited a lower Ni content (24.6 at%) than on the Ni foam (32.9%), as confirmed by WDS (Table S3†).
The catalyst performance of the CoNi1@C catalyst for the OER not only surpasses that of bimetallic MOFs of PBA,21 MOF-74 (ref. 22) or partially doped ZIF-67(Co–Ni)68 derived Co–Ni mixed oxide catalysts, but also outperforms that of most Co–Ni based catalysts developed via other methods (Table S4†). Compared with some state-of-the-art seamless integration electrodes with Ni foam as the substrate,69–71 CoNi1@C exhibits a slightly higher overpotential at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2, which is probably caused by the addition of binder during our coating procedure.
The high OER catalyst activity of CoNi1@C could be attributed to the following reasons: (1) the synergistic effect of bimetal oxides. More importantly, the stabilized high valence state of Ni, which is regarded as the active site, could promote the OER. In the spinel structure, the trivalent ions play an important role in stimulating the absorbed oxygen by the beneficial electrostatic adsorption of OH− ions to the formation of MOOH and then inducing deprotonation of OOH− species to produce O2.72–75 (2) This unique hierarchical porous honeycomb-like structure could facilitate the transportation of ions and enhance the stability of the structure during the electrochemical test.76–78
In addition, a carbon shell network could ensure the electrical continuity of bimetal oxide particles and suppress the agglomeration of nanoparticles during pyrolysis and electrochemical tests.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a new series of bimetallic MOFs were successfully prepared using the one-step synthesis method. The molar ratio of the metal nodes in these bimetallic MOFs can be arbitrarily varied while the nodes are randomly and uniformly distributed inside the frameworks. Moreover, the pillars in this series of bimetallic MOFs are tunable. As expected, with incorporation of a second metal ion, the intrinsic properties (such as thermal stabilities and band gaps) of the pristine MOFs can be tailored. In order to prepare bimetal oxide catalysts for the OER, these bimetallic MOFs were pyrolyzed and used as self-sacrificial templates. The resulting materials showed a hierarchical porous honeycomb-like structure with carbon covered (bi)metal oxide nanostructures. After pyrolysis, the bimetallic MOF with a high ratio of Co leads to the highest catalyst performance for the OER due to the unique structure and high valence state of Ni. At a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the overpotentials of CoNi1@C are 335 mV and 276 mV for the OER on the RDE and Ni foam, respectively. These promising results not only prove that the properties of MOFs can be tailored by incorporation of a second metal into the MOF structure but also show possibilities for wider applications of this new bimetallic MOF family.
4. Experimental
4.1 Preparation of bimetallic MOFs
All the chemicals were used without further purification. In a typical method, different proportions of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (≥99%, Merck, Germany) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (≥99%, VWR International bvba, Belgium) were dissolved in 40 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, ≥99% Chem-Lab). 1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylic acid (0.844 g, H3BTC, 98% purity, ABCR, Germany) and 4,4-dipyridyl (0.768 g bipy, 98% purity, Acros Organics) were dissolved in 40 mL DMF as well. The two homogeneous solutions were mixed together into a 100 mL glass bottle. The molar ratios of Co(NO3)2·6H2O vs. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O are shown in Fig. S19† while the total molar concentration of metal salts is 12 mmol. After that, the glass bottle was maintained at 50 °C in a water bath (Memmert, WNB 45) for 72 h and then naturally cooled down to room temperature. In order to remove the residual reactant, the powder was washed several times with DMF and ethanol successively. The corresponding samples from pure cobalt-MOF to pure nickel-MOF were denoted as Co-MOF, CoNiBMMOF-1, CoNiBMMOF-2, CoNiBMMOF-3, CoNiBMMOF-4, CoNiBMMOF-5, and Ni-MOF, respectively. In order to prove that new families of bimetallic MOFs can be tailored using the pillar strategy, an identical series of bimetallic MOFs based on DMF as the pillar were prepared by the same method at 100 °C. The details are shown in Table S5.†
4.2 Preparation of MOF derived bimetallic catalysts
The Co-MOF, CoNiBMMOF-1, CoNiBMMOF-2, CoNiBMMOF-3 and Ni-MOF were pyrolyzed at 500 °C for 8 h in a nitrogen gas atmosphere with a flow rate of 300 mL min−1. The temperature inside the furnace was gradually increased to 500 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. After the pyrolysis, the furnace was cooled down to room temperature with a cooling rate of 3 °C min−1. The resulting powder was ultrasonically cleaned with DI water and EtOH successively, and then dried at 60 °C. After that, the as-prepared black powder was further annealed at 350 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 in air to oxidize the metal phase. The different kinds of MOF-derived catalysts were denoted as Co@C, CoNi1@C, CoNi2@C, CoNi3@C and Ni@C, respectively.
4.3 Material characterization
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a thermogravimetric analyzer (AutoTGA 2950HR V5.4A, TA Instruments) using platinum pans at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in a N2 atmosphere. Decomposition temperatures are deduced by the intersection of a straight baseline with the tangent of the weight versus temperature. A Bruker AXS D8 diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation with λ = 0.15405 nm and Ni filter) with 2θ ranging from 5° to 30° and a step of 0.02° (2 s per step) was used to record X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples. The morphologies and structures of the samples were observed on a FEI/Philips XL30 FEG microscope (SEM). Metal compositional analyses of BMMOFs were performed using a full quantitative electron probe micro-analyzer system coupled with wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (EPMA-WDS; JEOL JXA-8530F, Tokyo, Japan) with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV at a probe current of 15 nA. Before the SEM and EPMA tests, BMMOFs were sputtered with a 10 nm layer of Pt to improve the electronic conductivity. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were collected using an FEI Tecnai F20 field emission gun microscope operated at 200 kV with a point-to-point resolution of 0.19 nm, which is equipped with high angle annular dark field (HAADF) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) detectors. The obtained images and spectra were analyzed using Gatan Digital Micrograph software. ESCALAB250 (monochromatic Al Kα with 1486.6 eV) was used to collect X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data. The metal compositions in Co-MOF, Ni-MOF and BMMOFs (dissolved in 0.5 M HCL) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Varian 720-ES). A micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus was used to investigate the specific surface area and pore size distributions. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy was carried out on a Varian Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer at room temperature.
4.4 Electrochemical characterization

Preparation of working electrodes. 
The catalyst inks were prepared by dispersing 10 mg of the catalyst into 1 mL solvent (800 μL ethanol and 200 μL DI water) containing 20 μL 5 wt% Nafion (Alfa Aesar Germany). Before loading the catalysts on the GCE, the ink was sonicated for 30 minutes. Then 10 μL of the as-prepared catalyst ink was loaded on the surface of the GCE (5 mm in diameter) corresponding to an areal mass loading of about 0.50 mg cm−2. For comparison, IrO2 (P40V020, particles from Premetek Co.) was used in identical electrochemical tests with the same mass loading. Electrochemical water splitting was carried out with the Pt/C catalyst (10% of platinum, Alfa Aesar Germany) and bimetallic MOF derived catalyst as the cathode and anode, respectively. Ni foam electrodes were prepared using the same procedure with a catalyst areal mass loading of around 3.0 mg cm−2 based on the geometrical area of both the Pt/C catalyst and bimetallic MOF derived catalyst.


Catalytic performance. 
The OER catalytic performance of the samples was evaluated by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) technique using an Autolab electrochemical workstation at room temperature. The tests were carried out in a three-electrode cell using a rotating disk electrode (RDE, PINE Research Company) at a rotation speed of 1600 rpm or without rotation. The glassy carbon electrode (GCE) or Ni foam, a Hg/HgO electrode and a graphite plate (1 cm × 5 cm) were used as the working electrode, the reference electrode and the counter electrode, respectively. Prior to the measurement, the electrolyte was purged with O2 for at least 30 min. The electrolyte was continuously bubbled with O2 during all the tests. The supporting electrolyte was 1 M KOH for all tests. The LSV currents are normalized by the mass of the active materials and the geometrical area of the GCE or the Ni foam respectively. All potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential as follows:ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.098 + 0.059 × pH
All LSV curves were iR-corrected to compensate the influence of the solution resistance by the following equation:EiR-corrected = E − iRwhere i is the current (A) and R (Ω) is the electrolyte resistance measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
