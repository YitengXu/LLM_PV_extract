    , Accepted 9th August 2019First published on 27th August 2019AbstractAsymmetric zinc phthalocyanine dyes bearing electron donating tert-butylsulfanyl or hexylsulfanyl groups and a carboxylic acid anchoring group that act as “push” and “pull”, respectively, have been designed, synthesized and used as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Theoretical calculations of Gibbs free energy change performed with the B3LYP, HSE06 and M06 functionals show that there is not a unique trend but a preference by the 2-GT6-cs and 2-GT4-cs isomers as the most stable structures. Electronic absorption spectra calculated with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) (M06/6-311G(d,p)) in THF indicate that, taking as a reference GT6 isomers, a red-shift of the Q bands is produced for the GT4 isomers, with values up to 33 nm. Theoretical calculations show that the hexyl chains in GT4 are located along the molecular plane, but the tert-butyl moieties in GT6 are non-planar. Therefore, compared with the planar one, the non-planar compound shows both a slight blue shift in absorption and a lower tendency for dye aggregation. When the dyes were employed in DSSCs with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a co-adsorbent, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was obtained as 3.19% for GT4 and 3.08% for GT6 under full sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) irradiation. This can be attributed to the higher dye loading of the DSSC sensitized with GT4. However, GT4 was considerably decomposed, while GT6 retained most of its initial optical properties after continuous sunlight exposure. This result demonstrates that the zinc phthalocyanine dye containing tert-butyl moieties shows excellent photostability.
Introduction
In recent years, various environmental issues caused by the consumption of a large amount of fossil fuels have attracted much attention. There is also serious concern that the world's limited energy resources will be exhausted in the near future because the world is facing a continuous growth in population and economy, especially in developing countries. From these points of view, photovoltaics and artificial photosynthesis are highly desirable technologies because clean solar energy from the sun is substantially inexhaustible.1 Solar cells that convert solar energy to electricity are a good alternative. Among the photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells have drawn considerable attention over the past two decades, showing advantages of relatively low-cost, eco-friendliness, and relatively high PCE.2 Due to the ease of preparing and testing the photovoltaic cells, research groups have proposed a number of improvements for almost every dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) component3–5 being the main source of the development of new and more efficient dyes for DSSCs. In the seminal paper by Grätzell6 a trimeric ruthenium complex was employed to sensitize nanostructured TiO2 films. Ruthenium dyes are still the most used and efficient colorants in DSSC devices,7–9 but they lack absorption properties in the near-infrared (NIR) part of the spectrum. The use of porphyrin (Por)-like sensitizers was then suggested to circumvent this issue. The design of the photosensitizer is fundamental in the race for performance optimization.10,11 Major synthetic efforts have been reported over the years and a number of dyes have marked important milestones in the field, especially Pors,1,10,12–14 phthalocyanines (Pcs),15–17 metal-free all-organic dyes18,19 and Ru(II)polypyridyl complexes.20–24 Pcs25,26 are an active focus of intense research for the development of efficient light-to-energy conversion devices.27–29
Por and Pc sensitizers, as large π-conjugated systems, have been used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) due to their high extinction coefficients, appropriate redox properties for the sensitization of TiO2 films and robustness.30,31 Recently, a push–pull structured Por dye SM315 has attained a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13% for single sensitized DSSCs.32 Nevertheless, the Pors sensitized solar cells lack absorption in the red or NIR spectral region, where the solar flux of photons is maximum.33 In comparison with Pors, Pcs as sensitizers in DSSCs have several intrinsic advantages such as higher extinction coefficients in the red or NIR region and remarkable robustness.26,34 However, despite their promising features, a record PCE value in Pcs sensitized solar cells employing an asymmetric ZnPc derivative (PcS20) bearing propoxy groups in the 2 and 6 positions of the peripheral phenoxy units and a carboxylic acid group has been reported to be 6.4%,35 which is lower than that of Pors.
The unimpressive photovoltaic performance of Pcs is mainly due to their strong aggregation tendency on the TiO2 surface and low-lying LUMO level, which limit electron-injection kinetics.11 The use of bulky aliphatic and aromatic electron donating groups on Pcs not only prevents the intermolecular interaction but also arranges the LUMO level.36–39 Taking these issues into consideration, herein, we report the synthetic routes, electro-optical properties, theoretical calculations and photovoltaic performances of two new asymmetric phthalocyanine compounds together with a carboxylic acid as the electron-withdrawing and anchoring group and hexylsulfanyl (GT4) or tert-butylsulfanyl (GT6) as the bulky electron donating groups. Compared with previously reported similar asymmetric phthalocyanines containing tert-butyl groups,37,38 it is expected that the additional sulfur atom together with the tert-butyl group (tert-butylsulfanyl) may relatively reduce the molecular planarity which is beneficial for suppressing aggregation.38 The photovoltaic data indicate that the incorporation of the tert-butyl moieties into the sensitizer not only minimizes the dye aggregation but also shows high photostability.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
It has been described that the design of bulky peripheral substituents on the phthalocyanine ring was paramount to reduce the formation of aggregates on the TiO2 surface and thereby achieve impressive power conversion efficiencies.37,40 The low efficiency of cells incorporating phthalocyanines appears to be due to aggregation and lack of directionality in the excited state.41
In this paper, new two different AB3 type ZnPc compounds (GT4 and GT6) were designed to be used as efficient sensitizers for DSSCs, bearing bulky tert-butylsulfanyl peripheral substituents to prevent the aggregation phenomenon and hexylsulfanyl groups as the electron donating group (Scheme 1). The synthesis of asymmetrical phthalocyanines is more complicated compared to symmetrically substituted Pcs. AB3 phthalocyanines are easily obtained by cyclotetramerization reactions applied to a statistical mixture of two phthalonitriles.42 The calculated ratio of starting materials for formation of a mixture of only two derivatives as the symmetric B4 and the desired AB3 phthalocyanine is 1:9. This 1:9 ratio was applied to a mixture of starting phthalonitrile (3,4-dicyano benzoic acid, A) and alkylsulfanyl groups containing phthalonitriles (B) which was subjected to mixed cyclotetramerization in the presence of excess zinc(II) chloride in DMF, and led to the symmetric hexylsulfanyl or tert-butylsulfanyl substituted Pc derivatives identified accordingly to our previous reports41,43 and to the desired mono-carboxylated AB3 Pcs (GT4 and GT6) separated by column chromatography.44–46

The newly synthesized Pc derivatives were fully characterized using a variety of spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, FT-IR, mass spectrometry (MS), fluorescence and electronic absorption spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S14 and Table S1, ESI†).
Using an unprotected carboxylate-substituted phthalonitrile under such phthalocyanine formation conditions led to the expectation of the esterification of the carboxylate function by the solvent. Unlike this, and following other previous reports,45,47–49 the desired AB3 derivatives (GT4 and GT6) were obtained without being esterified. All the characterization and spectroscopic data confirm the acquisition of monocarboxylated phthalocyanines (GT4 and GT6). In the FT-IR spectra of GT4 and GT6, the presence of the characteristic broad stretching vibration of carboxylic acid –OH at about 3300 cm−1 and the CO peak at about 1710 cm−1 indicated that the formation of Pc derivatives has taken place.
The 1H NMR spectra of asymmetrical ZnPcs GT4 and GT6 are somewhat broader than the corresponding signals in symmetrical ZnPc derivatives (B4) (Fig. S3 and S10, ESI†). Tetrasubstituted phthalocyanines obtained from four substituted phthalonitriles are naturally a mixture of isomers, which is a primary reason that carboxylic acid groups can be considered as another reason for the broadness of the peaks in 1H NMR.45,50 NMR investigations of GT4 and GT6 provided the characteristic chemical shifts for the structures expected (see Experimental section). Compared to Pc derivatives with precursors, the signals of ZnPc derivatives shifted slightly downfield, which is associated with the aromatic ring current effect of the Pc macrocycle. The carboxylic acid protons have been observed only for GT4. The acid proton is often difficult to locate due to its varying chemical shift. Also, the presence of water and oxygen in the sample may lead to the OH not being seen as it is easily exchangeable with deuterated solvents and the exchange is too fast on the NMR timescale; hence the peak is hardly observed. The integration of the peaks corresponded suitably to the expected number of protons for both complexes, further confirming the relative purity of the complexes.
MALDI-TOF MS spectra are very important for verifying the structure in asymmetrical phthalocyanines. The purified monofunctional phthalocyanines were further characterized by mass spectra. In the MALDI-TOF MS spectra, the molecular ion peaks were observed at m/z 971.542 and 884.055 for GT4 and GT6, respectively. There was no indication of other substituted derivatives on both mass spectra (Fig. S1 and S8, ESI†).
Optical and electrochemical properties
One of the best proofs for the formation of phthalocyanines is supported by their ground state electronic spectra in the studied solution. The electronic absorption spectrum of metallated phthalocyanine shows two characteristic bands: the Soret band near 340 nm and a single Q band between 600 and 800 nm due to a π–π* ligand transition. These two bands are dependent on the electronic interactions between the ligand as well as by the state of the central atom and peripheral substitution. The aggregation behavior of asymmetrical phthalocyanines (GT4 and GT6) has been investigated in THF at different concentrations (Fig. S5 and S12, ESI†). As a result, both molecules obeyed the Lambert–Beer law at concentrations ranging from 1.2 × 10−5 to 4 × 10−6 M.51

Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of the dyes dissolved in THF. As can be seen, the phthalocyanine dyes show a Soret-band at around 300–400 nm and an intense Q-band at around 650–750 nm.52 Compared with GT6, GT4 exhibits a slightly red shift and enhancement in the molar extinction coefficient for the Q-band as listed in Table 1, which is beneficial for improving the light-harvesting efficiency.51 On the other hand, this result indicates that the branched tert-butyl substituents in GT6 reduce the molecular planarity, decrease the conjugation of the macrocycle and hence shift the absorption maximum wavelength hypsochromically.53–55 This is in line with the results of the theoretical calculations (vide infra).

Fig. 2 shows a red-shifted and broadened Q-band as well as a new band at around 640 nm for GT6 adsorbed on the TiO2 film without CDCA, a widely employed anti-aggregation co-adsorbent, as compared with its THF solution. These changes might be due to the formation of aggregation on the TiO2 surface.56 On the other hand, the bands of GT4 are noticeably broadened and overlapped as compared with GT6, indicating that the former is more aggregated than the latter.57 This result may be due to the coplanar donors in GT4 allowing more compact packing of the dye molecules on the TiO2 surface.58 In the case of GT6, the aggregation might be minimized by the steric hindrance of the non-planar tert-butyl moieties, which is in good agreement with the results obtained for the zinc phthalocyanines38 and the metal-free organic chromophores.55 With 5 mM CDCA, the absorption spectra of the dyes become narrower compared with those in the absence of CDCA, which provides further evidence for the fraction of aggregated dyes reduced by the co-adsorbent.59,60

The effect of the donors on the energy levels of the dyes was investigated by using SWV measurements (Fig. S16, ESI†) and the relevant data listed in Table 1. As can be seen, the redox processes of GT6 are remarkably sharp, which can be due to its aggregation-resistant nonplanar structure.61 The first oxidation potentials (HOMO) of GT6 and GT4 are 1.04 and 0.78 V vs. NHE, respectively, which are significantly more positive than that of the redox electrolyte (0.4 V vs. NHE), ensuring fast regeneration of the dyes.62 On the other hand, the down-shifted HOMO level for GT6 may be due to the charge-transfer interactions from the donors to the acceptor becoming difficult, suggesting that the conjugation is partially decreased.63 The LUMO levels of the dyes are much more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), indicative of thermodynamic feasibility for electron injection from the excited dyes into the CB of TiO2.62
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs based on the individual dyes fabricated in the absence and presence of 5 mM CDCA are presented in Fig. 3a and Table 2. All the parameters presented are under optimum conditions of immersion time, dye bath solvent etc. In the absence of CDCA, the short circuit current density (JSC) of 7.08 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.595 V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.74% for the GT6-sensitized DSSC are higher than for GT4 (JSC = 6.42 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.592 V and PCE = 2.51%). It is well known that the dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface usually quenches the excited state of the dye molecules and subsequently reduces the electron injection efficiency in DSSCs.58 Therefore, the higher photovoltaic performance of GT6 could be explained by the relatively lower aggregation of the dye due to the bulky substituents.55 When CDCA was added to the dye bath as a co-adsorbent to prevent aggregation, GT4-sensitized DSSC showed the highest PCE of 3.19%, which is a 27% improvement compared to the DSSC without CDCA due to suppressing the serious aggregation effectively.64 However, the DSSC based on GT6 fabricated with CDCA demonstrated a PCE of 3.08%, representing only 12% improvement compared to the DSSC without CDCA. This indicates that this sensitizer can suppress the aggregation on the TiO2 surface due to its non-planar structure.64 Nevertheless, JSC, VOC and PCE for GT4 are slightly higher than for GT6 due to its higher dye loading amount,65 as listed in Table 2. In other words, the increase of dye loading not only enhances the light absorption efficiency but also suppress the electron recombination.

The difference in JSC was further confirmed by IPCE measurements of the DSSCs with and without CDCA (Fig. 3b and Table 2). The IPCE responses of both dyes with CDCA are narrower and higher than those without CDCA indicating that the aggregation was repressed, thus resulting in an increase of JSC.66 The highest IPCE values of DSSCs based on GT6 and GT4 with CDCA exhibit 13% and 51% improvement compared with those of DSSCs without CDCA. These results provide further evidence that the bulky tert-butyl moieties suppress the aggregation of dye molecules on the TiO2 surface.
The EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) was employed to further verify the VOC values of the DSSCs fabricated with the co-adsorbent. As shown in Fig. 4a, a large semicircle for each DSSC is observed in the Nyquist plot indicating the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The radius of the large semicircle increased in the order of GT6 (104 Ω) < GT4 (118 Ω), which is well in accordance with the VOC values, GT6 (0.601 V) < GT4 (0.610 V). The slightly lower VOC for GT6 can be attributed to the nonplanar molecular structure that decreased the dye loading on the TiO2 surface. It is known that the lower dye loading provides more void space for electrolyte penetration, resulting in a faster recombination.65 Electron lifetimes (τr), which can be estimated from the Bode plots, are 13.06 and 18.41 ms for GT6 and GT4, respectively (Fig. 4b). The longer τr indicates a lower dark current, resulting in a higher VOC.58

Photostability of DSSCs is one of the most important parameters for practical applications. According to the stability method reported by Katoh et al.,67 absorption spectra of the dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 films before and after 15 and 30 min of AM 1.5 simulated solar light irradiation were examined and compared in Fig. 5. After 30 min of light irradiation, the absorption spectrum of GT6 shows almost no change while GT4 shows a 21% decrease in absorbance. Obviously, the photostability of GT6 is much higher than that of GT4. The degradation of the latter might arise from the oxidation of the hexyl chains.68 Further study to identify the degradation is beyond the scope of this work and the subject of later studies. These results suggested that the asymmetric zinc phthalocyanine sensitizer bearing tert-butyl moieties is a promising candidate for practical applications.

Theoretical DFT calculations

Molecular structures. 

GT6 and GT4 isomers were fully optimized in four conformations in the gas phase at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory allowing complete relaxation. All the conformations were verified to correspond to minimum energy structures where only positive vibrational frequencies were obtained. In all the cases, the structures have a C1 point group. Fig. S15 (ESI†) shows a side and front view of the isomers, and it can be seen that the phthalocyanine macrocycle is a planar structure. The main difference in the geometry of the isomers is found by the position of the substituents in the macrocycle. The geometry optimization shows that in GT6, the tert-butyl moieties are located above and below the plane of the macrocycle. For GT4, the hexyl chains are located along the molecular plane and interactions between the substituents are not found.
With the aim to know the thermodynamic stability of the isomers, we calculated the Gibbs free energy change in solution (ΔGsolution) for three functionals; B3LYP, HSE06 and M06, and the results obtained are shown in Table 3. Gibbs free energies were computed at the B3LYP optimized geometry at a pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of 298.15 K. M06 is a hybrid meta exchange–correlation functional recommended for the study of organometallic and inorganometallic thermochemistry.69 The ΔGsolution values indicate that for the same phthalocyanine there is not a unique stability trend with all functionals. For GT6, we found that B3LYP and HSE06 predict that the cs-isomer as of higher stability, and a similar result is obtained for GT4 but with functionals HSE06 and M06. Additionally, the energy difference between isomers is dependent of the functional; considering the cs-isomer as a reference, for GT6 the larger difference is 0.3 kcal mol−1 for B3LYP and HSE06, and 0.6 kcal mol−1 for M06. Larger values are found for GT4; 1.8 kcal mol−1 and 2.7 kcal mol−1 for B3LYP and M06, respectively. The latter could be attributed to the longer substituents in the beta positions for GT4 that involves a higher electron density, which directly affects to the energies involved in ΔGsolution. HSE06 predicts 0.5 kcal mol−1 as the longer energy difference between isomers.

The solvation effect computed by ΔGsolvation indicates that it is very similar in both series of isomers GT6 and GT4 (≈17–18 kcal mol−1), which shows that the more important changes in ΔGsolution are produced by the enthalpic and entropic factors in the gas phase. The effect of the ligand size, a tert-butyl moiety in GT6 and a hexyl chain in GT4, is also reflected by an increase in the dipole moment value for the latter series.
On the other hand, the GAP HL calculations (Table 3) show for a kind of dye the same trend with all functionals; in GT6 the d2h-isomer presents the lower value and the higher electronic reactivity, while in GT4 this corresponds to the c4h-isomer. The theoretical values of GAP HL show an agreement with the experimental data given by E0–0 (1.75 for GT4 and 1.78 for GT6) in the sense that the same trend occurs, GT6 gives a slightly larger value than GT4 in the range of 0.04–0.1 eV. Finally, the HSE06 functional predicts absolute values of GAP HL more similar to the experimental data (1.78 for GT6 and 1.75 for GT4).


Electronic absorption spectra. 
For the study of the absorption photophysical properties, we calculate the electronic absorption spectra of the ground state of the isomers using the TD-DFT method and the M06/6-311G(d,p) level of theory in the solution phase (solvent tetrahydrofuran). The results of the more relevant excited states of GT6 and GT4 isomers are presented in Table 4. This includes the excitation wavelength (λ) and energy (E), oscillator strength (f) and electronic transitions between the molecular orbitals.

Both series show the characteristic bands of the phthalocyanines, Q and Soret. For all the isomers, we found two Q bands and one Soret band, the former being a slightly higher intensity reflected in the oscillator strength, ≈0.7 and ≈0.6 for Q and Soret, respectively. The GT6 series presents Q bands in the range of 645–668 nm. However, the GT4 series shows a red-shift of their Qx and Qy bands that absorb in the range of 660–695 nm, with a shifting value up to 33 and 24 nm, respectively. The deviation of the theoretical bands with respect to the experimental data is negligible for the Q bands in both series, 0.03 to 0.12 eV for GT6 and 0.00 to 0.16 eV for GT4.
For the Soret band, a larger deviation with respect to the experimental data is found, 0.23 to 0.27 eV in the GT6 series and 0.26 to 0.39 eV in the GT4 series, although this magnitude is accepted for TD-DFT calculations. This leads to the conclusion that the functional used (M06) represents reasonably the absorption spectra. Furthermore, taking as reference GT6, we found that the Soret absorption predicted for the GT4 series is blue-shifted up to 10 nm. This means that the ligand of larger size (hexyl chain) in GT4 favors the absorption of lower energy (longer wavelength) (Q bands) providing better qualities as a photosensitizer to be used in dye-sensitized solar cells.
We also investigated the effect of the dispersion energy in the calculations of the UV-vis spectra that only applied to GT4 isomers. Using the optimized geometry obtained with the Grimme-D3 dispersion energy, TD-DFT calculations were carried out for the four GT4 isomers considering also the D3 correction. The new spectra predict the same absorption value as the calculations without dispersion, and in some cases, a difference of 1 nm was found. This suggests that the dispersion plays not an important role in this kind of structure and therefore indicates that its inclusion it is not required in the calculations.
The effect of the functional was also explored on the GT4 series, and as an illustration, we applied on 4-GT4-c2v because it has a lower deviation. The electronic spectrum was calculated with the functional HSE70 and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. The results predict a blue-shift of the Q bands (666 and 640 nm for Qx and Qy, respectively) in about 20 nm and a red-shift of the Soret (341 nm) band in about 6 nm with respect to the M06/6-311G(d,p) values. Our main concern is the absorption of the Q bands at longer wavelength with a lower energetic cost to be used in dye-sensitized solar cells. Because the Q bands calculated with HSE are predicted at lower wavelength and present a larger deviation with respect to the experimental data, we continue our study with the functional M06 that predicts a lower deviation.
Overall, we found for both series that the Q bands correspond to the singlet excited states S1 and S2 with electronic transitions H → L (Qx) and H → L+1 (Qy), respectively, which are transitions π → π*. Fig. 6 shows the occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals that participate in the Q and Soret bands for the isomers of higher stability according to B3LYP, 2-GT6-cs, and 3-GT4-c4h. Similar results were found for the same molecular orbitals of the other functionals (HSE06, M06). As it can be seen, Qx and Qy are pure states with a unique transition between MOs. HOMO, LUMO, and LUMO+1 are mainly located on the macrocycle and a contribution of the metal atom or the substituent is not observed. In the case of Soret, several transitions are assigned to that excited state, and because of that we calculated the natural transition orbitals (NTOs) that are shown in Fig. 6 as hole state (occupied) and electron state (unoccupied). The advantage of NTOs is that they include all the MOs involved in the excited state. For both 2-GT6-cs and 3-GT4-c4h isomers, there is a strong contribution of the macrocycle core and particularly an important contribution of two (3-GT4-c4h) and three (2-GT6-cs) peripheral benzene moieties is observed in the hole state. Soret absorption values of about 330 nm for the GT6 and GT4 series can be attributed to a higher concentration of the electronic density in the hole states and a larger dispersion in the electron states.

Conclusions
In summary, two asymmetric zinc phthalocyanine derivatives containing one carboxylic acid anchoring and tert-butylsulfanyl (GT6) or hexylsulfanyl (GT4) electron donating groups have been designed and synthesized to investigate the influence of donor groups on the performance of the DSSCs. Theoretical calculations performed using DFT allowed us to study the four isomers of each GT6 and GT4 series. In all cases, the isomers present a planar macrocycle where the hexyl chains are almost coplanar, whereas the tert-butyl moieties are located above and below the molecular plane. For finding the most stable isomer in each series, we calculated the Gibbs free energy change in solution (ΔGsolution) for three functionals; B3LYP, HSE06 and M06, which showed that there is no a unique trend, but the results indicate a preference of the cs-isomer as that of higher stability in GT6 and GT4.
On the other hand, electronic absorption spectra of the isomers were obtained by TD-DFT (M06/6-311G(d,p)) calculations in the solution phase and a good agreement with the measured data was found. The deviation for the Q bands has values up to 0.16 eV and for the Soret bands achieves up to 0.39 eV. Q and Soret bands are π → π* electronic transitions with the main contribution of the macrocycle core. Taking as reference GT6, the effect of the hexyl chains in GT4 leads to a red-shift of the Qx and Qy bands up to 33 and 24 nm, respectively. For Soret, a blue-shift of 10 nm occurs for GT4.
PCEs of the DSSCs based on GT6 and GT4 with the co-adsorbent improved by 12% and 27%, respectively, compared to the DSSCs without the co-adsorbent. The lower improvement in GT6 is due to the steric hindrance induced by the non-planar tert-butyl moieties. Furthermore, GT6 shows excellent robustness under sunlight irradiation, while GT4 was markedly decomposed under the same conditions. These results suggest that the tert-butyl moiety is a promising electron donor group to construct stable and efficient phthalocyanine sensitizers for solar cells. In the meantime, the theoretical calculations confirm the trend obtained in the experimental work that proposes GT4 isomers as better photosensitizers to be used in dye-sensitized solar cells.

Instruments
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the dye-sensitized photoanodes were recorded by a Shimadzu UV 2600 spectrophotometer. The dye loading amount was calculated by the absorbance of the dyes desorbed from the dye-sensitized photoanode using a 0.1 M NaOH solution in THF/H2O (1/1, v/v). Square wave voltammetry (SWV) measurements were carried out with a PARSTAT 2273 potentiostat using a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as a working electrode, a Pt disk as a reference electrode and a Pt wire as a counter electrode in 0.1 M solution of TBABF4 in DMSO containing 0.5 mM dye at a scan rate of 0.050 V s−1. The results were calibrated using the Fc/Fc+ redox couple as an external standard.

Computational details
The molecular structure of four positional isomers (1–4) corresponding to GT6 and GT4 was fully optimized at the ground state in the gas phase using density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP hybrid functional and the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. No pseudopotential was used for the metal atom (Zn). B3LYP combines the Becke's three-parameter non local hybrid exchange potential with the nonlocal correlation functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr.74–76 For the optimized geometries, vibrational frequency calculations were carried out at the same level of theory with the aim to verify that they correspond to energy minima and therefore to stable structures. We analyze the stability of the isomers in the solution phase (tetrahydrofuran) through the calculations of the Gibbs free energy change (ΔGsolution).77 The latter is obtained from: ΔGsolution = ΔGgas + ΔΔGsolvation where ΔΔGsolvation = ΔGsolvationrelative and ΔGsolvation = ESCF,solution − ESCF,gas.
Using the optimized structures obtained with B3LYP/6-31G(d,p), the UV-vis electronic absorption spectra were computed in the solution phase under the framework of time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) as implemented in the Gaussian 09 package.78 We calculated 50 excited states for each isomer as singlet–singlet vertical excitations, giving a total of 400 excited states for the eight isomers (GT4, GT6). As we have shown in our previous studies,79,80 the M06 functional reproduces successfully the UV-vis spectra of porphyrins and derivatives. Hence, we calculated the electronic absorption spectra of GT6 and GT4 isomers with this functional. Other authors have also shown the quality of the M06 functional.69,81,82 M06 is a global hybrid meta GGA (generalized gradient approximation) with 27% Hartree–Fock exact electronic exchange, where this functional includes a correction in the kinetic energy.69 The spectra were computed in the same solvent that was used in the experimental measurement, that is tetrahydrofuran (THF) with a dielectric constant of 7.43. The calculations including the solvent were performed with the self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) using the Conductor Polarizable Continuum Model (CPCM).80,82 Here the molecular-shaped cavity is built with the United Atom Topological Model applied on atomic radii of the Universal Force Field (UFF).83 We also analyzed the frontier molecular orbitals involved in the Q and Soret bands and when required, the natural transition orbitals (NTO)84 were calculated. NTO represents the whole excited state and takes into account all the electronic transitions involved in that state. All the calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 package.78
Fabrication and characterization of DSSCs
For the DSSCs, the TiO2 film composed of double transparent layers was prepared using the doctor-blade technique on an FTO substrate, as reported previously.85 Dye-sensitized photoanodes were prepared by immersing the TiO2 films in 0.3 mM solution of dyes with or without 5 mM CDCA as the co-adsorbent in EtOH/THF (1/1, v/v) at room temperature for 3 h. As a reference DSSC, the TiO2 film was also dipped in a solution made of 0.5 mM N719 and 5 mM CDCA in EtOH for 6 h. The Pt counter electrode was obtained by casting platinum paste solution on the FTO substrate. This Pt counter electrode was then assembled with the dye-sensitized photoanode using the sealing film. Finally, the electrolyte was injected between the photoanode and the counter electrode.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation using a solar simulator (96000, Newport) attached to the potentiostat at room temperature. The working area of DSSCs was 0.196 cm2. The irradiation density of 100 mW cm−2 was approximated using a calibrated silicon detector (918D-SL-OD3, Newport). For each dye, at least three devices were fabricated and a compensating curve was utilized. IPCE spectra of the DSSCs were measured with a monochromator (74004, Oriel). EIS measurements were recorded by the potentiostat at an applied bias voltage equivalent to the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of each DSSC in the dark.
