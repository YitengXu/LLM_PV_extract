    , Accepted 4th May 2022First published on 4th May 2022AbstractSee-through power windows are developed herein via a new design of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) that allows for the efficient utilization of spectrum-engineered solar photons from the visible to infrared range with both energy generation and saving features. These OSC-derived power windows simultaneously possess high color fidelity of visible transparency, outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) and energy-saving due to their excellent infrared photon rejection. Further, large-area modules were demonstrated with record PCEs of 16.04% (certified as 15.46%) in opaque and 11.28% in see-through ones, representing the best performing organic solar mini-modules to date. These modules worked healthily under outdoor operation. Our model analysis indicated that the installation of these see-through power windows worldwide would contribute to the carbon neutrality of society.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) contain only a hundred-nanometer-thin layer of organic absorbers, which, unlike crystalline inorganic photovoltaics, can potentially open up building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) application as new-form distributed power source. In this study, scientists from Zhejiang University have demonstrated high-performance see-through power windows with both energy generation and saving features that, derived from the newly designed semitransparent OSCs (ST-OSCs), can simultaneously exhibit high color fidelity of visible transparency, outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE), and energy saving due to their excellent infrared photon rejection. Large-area modules have achieved new record PCEs of 16.04% (certified as 15.46%) in opaque and 11.28% in see-through ones, representing the best organic solar modules to date. Considering the installation of billions of square meters of window glass for new buildings every year, a model analysis has indicated that introducing these see-through power windows would effectively contribute to the carbon neutrality of society, with an estimated total annual CO2 emission reduction of 0.13 billion metric tons in China. Such a number is equivalent to saving fuel in power plants by avoiding the complete combustion of 34.18 × 106 tons of standard coal or 4.27 × 109 cubic meters of natural gas.

Introduction
Solar cells play an irreplaceable role in powering our society with desirable eco-friendliness. Among them, organic solar cells (OSCs),1–7 utilizing solution-processable organic semiconductors with tunable optoelectronic properties, have emerged as a compelling clean energy technology,8–12 which unlike crystalline inorganic photovoltaics as centralized power plants, can lead to building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) as a new type of distributed power source. Nowadays, buildings account for the most important energy consumers.13 It has become essential to develop innovative technologies to improve building energy efficiencies. Considering the existence of over a hundred billion square meters of window glass in buildings, in addition to energy-saving approaches such as low-emissivity glass and films,14 there exists a huge yet unimplemented BIPV scenario to replace normal glass with see-through power windows with both energy generation and saving functions that can ideally be presented by semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs),15–17 which are yet to be explored.
In principle, realizing see-through power windows with both energy generation and saving functions requires the new design of multifunctional ST-OSCs that are capable of precisely utilizing visible to infrared photons of the solar spectrum. In general, ST-OSC-derived power windows should pass a calibrated portion of visible photons (380–780 nm) for their see-through properties and simultaneously convert near-infrared (NIR) and the remaining visible photons for power generation, while rejecting interior and exterior infrared (IR) photon transmission, which are inclined towards photon-thermal conversion, for energy saving. In recent years, encouraging progress has been achieved on prototype ST-OSCs,18–22 wherein the individual parameters have been improved by over 10% power conversion efficiency (PCE) with near 30% average visible transparency (AVT) over several square millimeter effective areas. Meanwhile, the demand for architectural aesthetics requires ST-OSCs to possess high fidelity of color presentation with a color rendering index (CRI) of over 90.23,24 To embed energy-saving functions, high-efficiency ST-OSCs should also be equipped with excellent infrared photon radiation rejection (IRR).25,26 So far, a single ST-OSC architecture that simultaneously resolves the optical and photovoltaic trade-offs among these multidimensional parameters, including AVT, CRI, IRR, and PCE, has not been demonstrated. Therefore, there remain challenges in developing multifunctional ST-OSCs, from the perspective of building-integrated power windows. Furthermore, besides small-area prototype cells, it is also highly important to achieve large-area organic solar modules equipped with energy generation and saving functions as well as architectural aesthetics of power windows with practical relevance, which have yet not been explored.
Herein, high-performance see-through power windows are developed with excellent energy generation and saving features, which are derived from newly designed multi-functional ST-OSCs with outstanding optical and photovoltaic properties from the visible to infrared range in the solar spectrum, simultaneously possessing an AVT of 32%, CRI of 90, IRR of 0.90, and over 11% PCE. To our knowledge, this represents the best-performing reported ST-OSC, possessing the excellent features of see-through power windows with high color fidelity of visible transparency and excellent energy generation and saving properties. By designing spectrum-engineered NIR photoactive blends (Fig. 1(a), ESI†) with ST-OSCs with a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) (Fig. 1(b)), we finely resolve the complicated optical and photovoltaic trade-offs faced by traditional photovoltaics. More importantly, large-area modules with manufacturing feasibility were successfully obtained with PCEs of 16.04% (certified as 15.46%) in opaque and 11.28% in see-through ones, reaching a new efficiency record for current organic solar modules (Fig. 1(c)). These modules have worked healthily through sunny, cloudy, and rainy days in continuous outdoor operation. Energy model analysis has suggested that these see-through power windows could lead to an impressive clean energy gain in buildings (Fig. 1(d)).

Results and discussion
Spectrum-engineered near-infrared photoactive blends
Typically, photoactive blends in ST-OSCs need to selectively absorb NIR photons and allow the transmission of visible photons.9,27 This results in optical and photovoltaic trade-offs for traditional ST-OSCs, meaning that a gain of visible transparency accompanies a decrease in photovoltaic performance. In order to simultaneously achieve high PCEs and high color fidelity of visible transmittance, we have designed and formulated new NIR ternary photoactive blends, different from the common approaches, by introducing a third NIR component with further red-shifted absorption into the host binary blend (Fig. 2(a)). It consists of a polymer donor, PM6, with a pair of structurally alike NIR acceptors, m-BTP-PhC6 and BO-4Cl.28,29 These two NIR acceptors are well miscible in nature, estimated from their surface free energies (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†). Note that BO-4Cl, with intense absorption in the 750–950 nm range, shows a further red-shifted absorption than m-BTP-PhC6. Upon introducing BO-4Cl into the host PM6:m-BTP-PhC6 blend, the ternary blend shows mainly increased near-infrared absorption without much change in the visible absorption properties (Fig. S2, ESI†), while creating a cascade in the energy diagram among the components in favour of photo charge generation (Fig. S3, ESI†).

To characterize the optoelectronic properties of the newly formulated NIR blends (Fig. 2(a)), we first constructed opaque OSCs with a conventional structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS-TA/active layer/Bis-FIMG/Ag. The performance of the corresponding devices reveals that the ternary blends clearly outperform the binary blends. Fig. 2(b) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1 and Table S2 (ESI†). The PM6:m-BTP-PhC6 binary OSCs exhibited an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.876 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.27 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 79.83%, with a PCE of 17.65%. With the further red-shifted NIR absorption range, the PM6:BO-4Cl binary OSCs obtained a high Jsc of 27.18 mA cm−2, while decreasing the Voc to 0.845 V, resulting in a similar PCE of 17.83% to that of PM6:m-BTP-PhC6 binary OSCs. It is typical of binary blends that the gain in photocurrent density from the broadening of NIR absorption is offset by the decrease of photovoltage. However, the level of performance for these binary OSCs is state-of-the-art under the assistance of the optimal charge-transporting layers30 (Bis-FIMG31 as the electron transport layer and PEDOT:PSS-TA32 as the hole transport layer, Fig. S4 and Table S3, ESI†).

Interestingly, the NIR ternary blends, by introducing 30 wt% BO-4Cl into the host PM6:m-BTP-PhC6 blend, achieve an optimal balance between photocurrent density and photovoltage in the ternary OSCs (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†). The best PCE of 18.61% is obtained for the ternary OSCs with a Voc of 0.868 V, a Jsc of 26.99 mA cm−2, and an FF of 79.49%. Detailed photovoltaic parameters for the ternary OSCs with varying BO-4Cl ratios are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). These ternary OSCs were also measured at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), Beijing, with a certified PCE of 18.3% (Fig. S7, ESI†). The ternary OSCs show an improved photo-response over the binary OSCs in terms of their external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 2(c)), and the calculated Jsc values from the integration of the EQE spectra agree with the measured Jsc (Table 1). From the above results, we confirm that the introduction of a red-shifted component into the host binary blend with a cascade of energetics helped balance the trade-off between the photocurrent and photovoltage of NIR OSCs, thus securing high PCEs.
The enhanced performance of the ternary OSCs can be further correlated to the improved charge and exciton dynamics.33 We revealed that the ternary blends exhibit a balanced charge transport, with a hole and electron mobility ratio (μh/μe) of 1.43 (μh of 3.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 2.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S8 and Table S5, ESI†). In addition, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements suggest that the introduction of the third component BO-4Cl (30 wt%) into the host PM6:m-BTP-PhC6 blend shows a negligible influence on the acceptor stacking properties relative to those of the pristine PM6:m-BTP-PhC6 binary blends, based on the OOP (010) diffraction peak (∼1.72 Å) (Fig. 2(d) and Fig. S9–S12, ESI†). It is advantageous to introduce a pair of structurally alike NIR acceptors, m-BTP-PhC6 and BO-4Cl, into the ternary blend. Note that m-BTP-PhC6 possesses unaxisymmetric aromatic chains of 3-hexylbenzene, whereas BO-4Cl has a linear alkyl chain at the thienyl bridges. The BO-4Cl stacking is relatively stronger than that of m-BTP-PhC6 in the binary blends. Moreover, the ternary blend also possesses more efficient exciton dissociation than the binary blends, as determined by steady-state photoluminescence34 (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements35 (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†). We further confirm that the ternary blends possess faster charge transfer rates than those of the binary blends via femtosecond (fs) transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy (Fig. S15, ESI† and Fig. 2(e), (f)). The dynamics of the hole transfer are characterized from the ground state bleach (GSB) signals of the polymer donor (550 nm) with the biexponential fit,36 showing the transfer rates of the ternary (τ1 = 0.287 ± 0.021 ps; τ2 = 12.173 ± 0.523 ps), PM6:m-BTP-PhC6 (τ1 =0.316 ± 0.027 ps; τ2 = 13.549 ± 0.615 ps), and PM6:BO-4Cl (τ1 = 0.479 ± 0.033 ps; τ2 = 16.246 ± 0.881 ps) systems. These results, including those of molecular packing, morphology, charge transport and exciton dynamics, reveal that the NIR ternary blends possess improved charge and exciton dynamics, more balanced charge transport, and lower exciton recombination over the host binary systems, which ultimately help improve the photovoltaic characteristics without significantly increasing the visible absorption of the ternary OSCs.
Multifunctional ST-OSCs
The visible absorption mainly from polymer donors can be further adjusted by tuning the donor/acceptor ratio (D/A ratio, by wt%) of the blend. We interestingly note that the high PCEs are well retained as 18.32% and 18.13% when adjusting the D/A ratio to 1:1.5 and 1:1.8 with fixed total weight. Herein, the visible absorption at 625 nm (from the donor) is decreased (Fig. 2(g) and Fig. S16, ESI†). This provides the possibility for the preparation of high-performance semitransparent organic solar cells with excellent optical and photovoltaic parameters (Table S6 and Fig. S17, ESI†).
With the varying D/A ratios in the ternary blends, we fabricated a series of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) in the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS-TA/active layer/Bis-FIMG/ultrathin Ag (16 nm).37–39 The photovoltaic performance and optical properties of the ST-OSCs are shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c) and Fig. S18 (ESI†), and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2 and Table S7 (ESI†). The device (named STOSC, Fig. 3(a)) based on the D/A ratio of 1:1.2 exhibits an efficiency of 13.05%, with an AVT of 19.32%. Clearly, increasing the proportion of acceptors in the blend does indeed enhance the AVT of the ST-OSCs, albeit at a modest level (Fig. 3(b)). The semitransparent organic solar cell with a D/A ratio of 1:1.5 shows a PCE of 12.78% and an AVT of 21.00%, and the semitransparent organic solar cell with a D/A ratio of 1:1.8 gives a PCE of 10.62%, and an AVT of 23.37%. However, these ST-devices with bare ultrathin silver exhibit deficiencies with their CRIs being below 75 and exhibiting a blue-green color (Fig. S19, ESI†) along with unsatisfactory IRR (below 0.90). To meet the demands for power windows in BIPVs, the fidelity of color presentation and the heat insulation capability of the ST-OSCs require further optimization.

That requires the management of different bands of photons in a more precise manner from the visible to infrared range. We have previously employed MoO3 and LiF as dielectric materials to prepare DBRs for multifunctional ST-OSCs.26,38 In this work, we have established the DBR design of MoO3 (30 nm)/LiF (130 nm)/MoO3 (60 nm), which is optimized by the optical simulation of ST-OSCs with the variation of layer thickness and the periodic structure of DBRs (ESI†). We have further integrated a carefully designed distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) atop the ultrathin transparent Ag, which helps adjust the visible transmittance peak and IR reflection of the ST-OSCs in the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS-TA/active layer/Bis-FIMG/ultrathin Ag (16 nm)/DBR. Encouragingly, the resultant ST-devices show a PCE of 11.26% (D/A ratio of 1:1.2), a Voc of 0.868 V, a Jsc of 16.98 mA cm−2, and an FF of 76.34% (Table S7, ESI†). Note that the optical parameters are simultaneously enhanced, showing an IRR of 0.89, AVT of 30% and CRI of 90, after integrating the DBR layer into STOSC (Table S7 and Fig. S18–S20, ESI†). Impressively, the D-STOSCs (ST-OSCs with DBR with a D/A ratio of 1:1.5) exhibit high photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 11.18%, while obtaining exceptional optical properties, with an IRR of 0.90, AVT of 32.07% and CRI of 90. It is also worth noting that D-STOSCs have already embedded the essential layout of ultrathin metal and metal oxide layers employed for energy-saving low-emissivity (Low-E) glass, while possessing more advanced optical management and rejection rate for infrared (IR) photon transmission. The simulated |E|2 distribution of D-STOSC is shown in Fig. S19 (ESI†). The EQE and quantum utilization efficiency (QUE) spectra (Fig. 3(c) and Fig. S20, ESI†) further affirm that these DBR-integrated semitransparent OSCs possess the capability of effective photon management in the solar spectrum.
The color presentation of these semitransparent devices is further discussed, with consideration of both the aesthetic and human eye color perception, that is, CRI and AVT, both being important optical factors in power-generating windows. STOSC exhibits CIE coordinates of (0.264, 0.282), and D-STOSC with DBR improves the color-rendering properties with CIE coordinates of (0.360, 0.351), approaching the white point of the diagram. It ensures high fidelity of color presentation from the transmitted light of D-STOSC, adjusted from blue (STOSC) to white (D-STOSC), as shown in Fig. 3(d) and (e). Taking this one step further, we compare the heat dissipation capability of D-STOSC. As shown in Fig. 3(e), the thermal image from the IR camera indicates that the temperature of the object is around 31.0 °C, while it is effectively decreased to around 26.2 °C when recorded through D-STOSC. This is due to D-STOSC having an excellent IR-rejection rate of 90% (800–2500 nm) for heat dissipation. To the best of our knowledge, these results not only demonstrate that D-STOSCs represent the best-performing current semitransparent solar cells with a CRI of over 90 (Fig. 3(f)) but also the best-performing ST-OSCs equipped with the desirable features (PCE, AVT, CRI, and IRR) of power windows.
Large-area opaque and semitransparent solar modules
More importantly, beyond the small-area prototype ST-OSCs, we have demonstrated the feasibility of accomplishing scaled up organic solar modules with the same device layout. Organic solar modules with a series of 7 sub-cells (Fig. 4(a)) have been successfully obtained with an excellent PCE of 16.04% in the designated area of 19.3 cm2 under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), which is the highest efficiency for organic solar mini-modules (below 50 cm2) to date.40–46 With the assistance of precise laser patterning, the geometrical fill factor of these modules is notably as high as 96.4%. Therefore, high photovoltaic efficiencies have been successfully retained even upon 320 times area scaling from the small-area prototype devices (PCE of 18.61%, 0.06 cm2). Fig. 4(b) shows a photograph of the opaque module. Detailed fabrication can be found in the experimental section. These modules were also measured at the Chinese National Photovoltaic Industry Metrology and Testing Center (NPVM) with a certified PCE of 15.46% (Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S21, Table S8, ESI†). Encouragingly, semitransparent organic solar modules (ST-module) have also been accomplished, yielding a PCE of 11.28% (Fig. S22, ESI†). This reveals that over 130 days of indoor storage, the efficiencies of the modules can remain above 95% of their initial performance (Fig. S22, ESI†). After incorporating DBR atop the semitransparent modules, the ST-module was optimized with high color fidelity of its see-through properties (Fig. 4(d)). In addition, monitored under outdoor conditions, the encapsulated modules work healthily through sunny, cloudy, and rainy days during autumn in Hangzhou (Fig. 4(e)). Compared to the developmental status of organic solar modules (Fig. 4(f)), our work herein represents the best performing organic solar mini-modules (below 50 cm2) so far. Of course, before being deployed into practice, there remain gaps, including the cost-effectiveness balance47 and long operational lifetime48 as well as the coating of large-area films with satisfying visual effects, to be addressed.

To evaluate the impact on the carbon footprint of society, we performed a model analysis to quantify the annual clean energy gain, including both energy generation and saving, from applying these see-through power windows in new buildings in China and worldwide (Fig. 5). Impressively, it could lead to an annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction of 0.13 billion metric tons in China and 0.67 billion metric tons worldwide. This number roughly equals a 2% reduction of the approximately 32 billion metric tons of global CO2 emissions per year. Herein, the estimation only considered the increased building area per year in China in 2019 from the China National Bureau of Statistics (Fig. S23, ESI†) and the annual effective sunlight time (Fig. S24, ESI†) of each location under the reasonable assumption of power windows at a power output of 100 W m−2. The annual energy saving per area unit of power windows is assigned as 50 kW h m−2 at the low bar of energy saving in China, which is extracted from the energy saving data from buildings using Low-E glass consisting of thin metal and metal oxide layers over common glass (ESI†).

Fig. 5(a) shows the estimated annual clean energy gain (consisting of energy generation and saving) in the top 24 provinces and cities in China in case power windows are installed in new buildings (ESI†). For instance, Jiangsu province with the largest number of new building areas and abundant sunlight time can lead to an annual clean energy gain of 41.03 × 109 kW h. The total annual clean energy gain across China is calculated to exceed 284.8 × 109 kW h by applying power windows in new buildings. With the estimated total annual CO2 emission reduction of 0.13 billion metric tons in China, such a number is equivalent to saving fuel in power plants by avoiding the complete combustion of 34.18 × 106 tons of standard coal or 4.27 × 109 cubic meters of natural gas (Fig. 5(b) and (c)). We further calculated that the per capita carbon emission reduction per year would roughly be 88.87 kg, from which the roughly estimated annual global CO2 emission reduction would be 0.67 billion metric tons on the basis of the total world population49 (Fig. 5(d)).
Conclusions
We have developed high-performance see-through power windows with excellent energy generation and saving features, which are derived from newly designed multifunctional semitransparent organic solar cells that effectively utilize the spectrum-engineered solar photons from the visible to infrared range, with high color fidelity of visible transparency (AVT of 32.07% and CRI of 90), outstanding power generation (PCE of 11.18%) and energy saving (IRR of 0.90, 780–2500 nm). More importantly, large-area modules with the same layout are obtained with record PCEs of 16.04% (certified as 15.46%, NPVM) in opaque devices and 11.28% in semitransparent ones, representing the best-performing organic solar modules to date. Our model analysis indicated the advantage of installing this type of see-through power windows in new buildings, impressively projecting an annual carbon dioxide emission reduction of 0.13 billion metric tons in China and 0.67 billion metric tons worldwide.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) contain only a hundred-nanometer-thin layer of organic absorbers, which, unlike crystalline inorganic photovoltaics, can potentially open up building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) application as new-form distributed power source. In this study, scientists from Zhejiang University have demonstrated high-performance see-through power windows with both energy generation and saving features that, derived from the newly designed semitransparent OSCs (ST-OSCs), can simultaneously exhibit high color fidelity of visible transparency, outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE), and energy saving due to their excellent infrared photon rejection. Large-area modules have achieved new record PCEs of 16.04% (certified as 15.46%) in opaque and 11.28% in see-through ones, representing the best organic solar modules to date. Considering the installation of billions of square meters of window glass for new buildings every year, a model analysis has indicated that introducing these see-through power windows would effectively contribute to the carbon neutrality of society, with an estimated total annual CO2 emission reduction of 0.13 billion metric tons in China. Such a number is equivalent to saving fuel in power plants by avoiding the complete combustion of 34.18 × 106 tons of standard coal or 4.27 × 109 cubic meters of natural gas.
