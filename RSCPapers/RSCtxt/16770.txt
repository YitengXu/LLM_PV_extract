    , Accepted 8th March 2018First published on 9th March 2018AbstractThe exploration of new anode materials with high gravimetric and volumetric Na-ion storage performances is urgent and advantageous, but it remains a great challenge. In this study, CoTe2/G composite nanosheets are prepared to achieve this goal by a solvothermal method due to the good properties and high density of 7.92 g cm−3 of bulk CoTe2. In the composite, CoTe2 nanoparticles with a size of 39 nm are uniformly anchored on graphene with strong interfacial interactions. The tap density of the composite can be as high as 1.82 g cm−3. As an anode material for SIBs, the CoTe2/G composite exhibits a high initial reversible gravimetric capacity of 382 mA h g−1 and a volumetric capacity of 695.2 mA h cm−3 along with excellent rate performance. Even at 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, the CoTe2/G composite still delivers gravimetric capacities as high as 295, 272 and 246 mA h g−1 and volumetric capacities of 536.9, 495.1 and 447.7 mA h cm−3. After 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1, the reversible gravimetric and volumetric capacities remain at 245 mA h g−1 and 445.9 mA h cm−3, respectively. The electrochemical dynamic analyses indicate that the Na-ion storage behaviour in the CoTe2/G composite is a surface-controlled capacitive process, which is helpful for higher rate performance. Besides, the enhanced performance of the CoTe2/G anode is ascribed to strong interfacial interaction between CoTe2 and graphene, which can effectively improve electron transfer and alleviate the volume changes of CoTe2 during the discharge/charge processes in SIBs. Accordingly, the CoTe2/G composite has great application prospect as a promising anode candidate for smart SIBs.
1 Introduction
Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted tremendous attention as feasible alternatives for present commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to the low cost and abundant reserves of sodium as well as their energy storage mechanism which is similar to that of LIBs.1–3 The development of SIBs is still in its infancy stage. The larger Na+ ionic radius results in slow sodium ion diffusion kinetics in the host materials, which leads to a low specific capacity, low rate capability, and a short cycling life of the host materials.4,5 Recent reports 6−11suggest that the development disordered, amorphous and even porous host materials can be one of the main strategies to provide more suitable accommodation space for sodium ions so as to improve their diffusion kinetics. According to the principle above, numerous materials, such as expanded graphite,6 3D amorphous carbon,7 N-doped carbon,8 amorphous TiO2 nanotube,9 and expanded MoS2,10 have been designed to enhance their Na-ion storage performance. In our previous study,11 an amorphous iron oxide/graphene composite has been designed to improve the Na-ion storage performance of iron oxide. This strategy can be efficient in improving the gravimetric capacities (mA h g−1) of the host materials, but the strategy is bound to reduce their volumetric capacities (mA h cm−3) because the density of the materials decreases. Besides gravimetric capacity, volumetric capacity should also be one of the important parameters to evaluate electrode materials in the future design of more compact and smart electronic devices and electric vehicles.12,13 Therefore, the exploration of new anode materials with high gravimetric and volumetric Na-ion storage performances is urgent and advantageous, but it remains a challenge.
Transition-metal chalcogenide (TMX; X = S, Se and Te) materials have attracted growing interest as anode materials for SIBs due to their high theoretical capacities and widespread availability. At present, transition-metal sulfide (TMS) and selenide (TMSe), such as MoS2,10,13 SnS2,14 MoSe2,15 and FeSe2,16 have been intensively investigated as anode materials for SIBs. In contrast, the design of transition-metal telluride (TMTes) as anode materials for SIBs is still in its infancy stage.17–20 Te has lower electronegativity, higher electron conductivity and larger atomic size than S and Se,21,22 which provides more space to accommodate Na ions and simultaneously improves the diffusion kinetics of Na ions. Therefore, TMTes can deliver comparable gravimetric specific capacities than TMSs and TMSes.17–19 Additionally, when compared with TMSs and TMSes, TMTes have larger molar masses and higher densities and thus, it is expected that TMTes can exhibit higher gravimetric and volumetric Na-ion storage performances.20 However, only few investigations on both gravimetric and volumetric Na-ion storage performances of other TMTes have been carried out.
As one of the most important metal tellurides, cobalt telluride exhibits promising properties as electrode material in various energy storage devices such as solar cells, and it is also vital for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen reductive reaction due to its unique properties.23–25 Besides, bulk CoTe2 has a high density of 7.92 g cm−3.26,27 Therefore, it can develop a series of CoTe2-based anode materials with higher gravimetric and volumetric Na-ion storage. However, to the best of our knowledge, the design of cobalt telluride as anode material for SIBs has not been reported. In this study, it is found that CoTe2 exhibits a high Na-ion storage activity when it is used as an anode material for SIBs. To improve the Na-ion storage performance, a CoTe2/G composite with a high density of ca. 1.82 g cm−3 is prepared via a one-pot solvothermal method (Scheme 1). There is strong interfacial interaction between CoTe2 and graphene, which helps to enhance electron transfer and to alleviate the volume changes. Therefore, the CoTe2/G composite exhibits a high initial gravimetric capacity of 382 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, a good rate capacity of 246 mA h g−1 even at 5 A g−1 and an excellent cycle stability of 1000 cycles. Remarkably, the CoTe2/G composite also exhibits a high initial volumetric capacity of 695.2 mA h cm−3. Accordingly, the CoTe2/G composite is expected to have a promising application potential in SIBs.

2 Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of CoTe2 and CoTe2/G composite
The pure CoTe2 is synthesized via a typical solvothermal method.28,29 Co(AC)2 and Na2TeO3 are used as Co and Te precursors, respectively. First, Co(AC)2 and Na2TeO3 are ultrasonically dispersed into a 40 ml solvent of diethylenetriamine (DETA) and deionized water (DIW) with a volume ratio of VDETA/VDIW = 2/1 and then, the solution is vigorously stirred for 30 min. Then, the solution is transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 16 h followed by cooling to room temperature naturally. At last, the obtained black sediments are collected and washed with DIW and ethanol to remove remnant precursors and solvents, and they are subsequently vacuum dried at 60 °C for 6 h. The final product CoTe2 is a black powder. To get the desired CoTe2, Co(AC)2 and Na2TeO3 are used in different molar ratios of 0.5:1, 1:1, and 2:1 to carry out the synthesis of CoTe2 by the abovementioned procedure.
The CoTe2/G composite is synthesized via a similar method (Scheme 1). First, 0.5 mmol Co(AC)2, 1 mmol Na2TeO3 and 60 mg graphene oxide (GO), prepared from graphite powder according to the modified Hummers method,30 are ultrasonically dispersed into a 40 ml solvent of diethylenetriamine (DETA) and deionized water (DIW) with a volume ratio of VDETA/VDIW = 2/1 and then, the solution is vigorously stirred for 30 min. Then, the solution is transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 16 h followed by natural cooling to room temperature. Last, the CoTe2/G composite is obtained by annealing at 500 °C for 2 h in an argon gas atmosphere. The graphene nanosheets can be obtained by the removal of the CoTe2 in CoTe2/G composites by using 1 M HCl solution and by washing with DIW and ethanol to remove the residual HCl; subsequently, this is followed by vacuum drying at 60 °C for 6 h.
2.2 Characterization
The morphologies and microstructures are measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4700 field emission microscope), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Tecnai G2 F20 UTWIN electron microscope). The crystal structures of the samples are tested by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on the Rigaku D/max-2500B2+/PC system with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) over the range of 5–90° (2θ) at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) are obtained on a Thermo Electron Corporation ESCALAB 250 XPS spectrometer with Al K X-ray sources of 30 eV pass energy in 0.5 eV step over an area of 650 μm × 650 μm to the sample. Raman spectra are obtained on a JY HR800 Raman spectrometer using a 514 nm laser excitation from 1000 to 2000 cm−1. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis is carried out on a NETZSCH STA 449C analyser from room temperature to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in air atmosphere. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the samples are obtained by isothermal nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements on a surface analyser (Micromeritics, ASAP 2020) at 77 K. The tap density is tested by an intelligent vibration density meter (PF-300B).
2.3 Electrochemical measurements
The Na-ion storage performances of CoTe2 and CoTe2/G composite are tested by using the CR2025-type cells, which are assembled in a glove box filled with argon. The working electrode is prepared by mixing a slurry of active materials (80 wt%), carbonaceous conductor additive (Super P, 10 wt%) and carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC, 10 wt%) and then, the slurry is coated onto copper foils and at last, the copper foils are dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h. The working electrode is cut into several pieces with a diameter of 12 mm to be used in the assembly of the SIB cell. Active materials in every piece are ca. 2 mg. Sodium metal sheet is used as the counter electrode, 1 M NaCF3SO3 in diglyme is used as the electrolyte, and glass fibres are used as the separator.
The galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements are carried out on the LAND-CT2001A battery testing system at various current densities under a voltage window in the range of 0.01–2.8 V for the analysis of Na-ion storage at room temperature. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement is performed at different scan rates in a range of 0.01–2.8 V on the Zennium electrochemical workstation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is performed on the electrochemical workstation with the frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz.
3 Results and discussion
CoTe2 nanoparticles are prepared by a solvothermal method using cobalt acetate (Co(AC)2) and sodium tellurite (Na2TeO3) as Co and Te precursors, respectively. The formation mechanism of CoTe2 is as follows:28,29 Co(AC)2 and Na2TeO3 can dissociate and form Co2+ and TeO32−, respectively, in solvent at room temperature. Then, due to the weak reducibility of DETA,28,29 TeO32− can be reduced by DETA to form Te monomers, which is confirmed by XRD pattern of the intermediates obtained at 180 °C for 3 h (Fig. S1†). At last, Co2+ and Te monomers react with each other to form cobalt telluride at 180 °C by increasing the reaction time to 16 h. It is found that mole ratio of the precursor Co(AC)2/Na2TeO3 has an important effect on the morphologies and compositions of the final products. To determine a suitable molar ratio, various samples are prepared by varying the ratio of the precursor Co(AC)2/Na2TeO3. The samples synthesized at molar ratios of 0.5:1, 1:1, and 2:1 for Co(AC)2/Na2TeO3 are investigated by XRD and SEM measurements (Fig. S2 and S3†). It can be seen that the CoTe2 particles with high purity and small diameter are obtained from a molar ratio of 0.5:1. Therefore, the syntheses of both pure CoTe2 and CoTe2/G composite are carried out using the Co(AC)2/Na2TeO3 molar ratio of 0.5:1 in this study.
The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared CoTe2 nanoparticles are investigated by SEM and TEM (Fig. 1). The average diameter of CoTe2 nanoparticles is 121 nm as can be seen from the histogram of the particle size distribution (Fig. 1b). From the XRD pattern (Fig. 2a), all of the diffractional peaks of the sample can be readily indexed to the orthorhombic CoTe2 (JCPDS card no. 74-0245).31 No other peaks from impurities are detected, suggesting high phase purity of CoTe2. The HRTEM image (Fig. 1d) shows that CoTe2 nanoparticles are composed of many small grains with clear crystal lattices, indicating multicrystalline structures and high crystallinity of CoTe2 nanoparticles. The distinct fringes of 0.28 nm agree well with the (111) lattice plane of CoTe2. The adjacent two CoTe2 grains show an interesting and different orientation, and there are many dislocations between them, indicating that CoTe2 nanoparticles are generated by the oriented attachment of CoTe2 preliminary nanocrystal, and this is in accordance with the results of previous reports.29,32 The BET surface area of CoTe2 nanoparticles is 9.1 m2 g−1 (Fig. S4†).

With the addition of GO, the CoTe2/G composite can be synthesized under the same condition as that used for the synthesis of CoTe2. In the XRD pattern of the CoTe2/G composite, a broadened diffraction peak appears at about 26° (Fig. 2a), which can be indexed into the stacked graphene, indicating the successful reduction of GO; all of the other diffraction peaks can still be attributed to CoTe2, indicating that the addition of GO does not influence the phase purity of CoTe2. However, the addition of GO can obviously affect the particle size of the CoTe2 nanoparticles in the composite. The SEM image (Fig. 3a) reveals that the CoTe2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on the wrinkled graphene nanosheets. The elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 3b) shows that the elements C, Co and Te are homogeneously dispersed on the whole nanosheets, indicating that CoTe2 nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the graphene nanosheets. From the histogram of particle size distribution (Fig. 3c), it can be found that the average diameter of CoTe2 nanoparticles in this composite is ca. 39 nm, which is much less than that of the as-prepared CoTe2 nanoparticles. The TEM image (Fig. 3d) also indicates that the CoTe2 nanoparticles are uniformly anchored on the graphene nanosheets. Remarkably, the wrinkled structure of graphene hinders the agglomeration of CoTe2 nanoparticles and enables their efficient distribution on graphene.33 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3e) can be indexed to the orthorhombic CoTe2, and this confirms the formation of a pure phase of CoTe2 in the CoTe2/G composite. The HRTEM image (Fig. 3f) shows clear lattice fringes of the (111) crystal plane for CoTe2. Besides, TG analysis (Fig. S5†) shows that the graphene content in the composite is estimated to be approximately 18.1 wt%. The BET surface area of the CoTe2/G composite is 26.2 m2 g−1 (Fig. S4†), which is slightly higher than that of CoTe2 nanoparticles; this may result from the addition of graphene and the smaller size of CoTe2 in the composite.

The Raman spectra of GO, CoTe2 and the CoTe2/G composite are tested to further reveal their features (Fig. 2b). The peak appearing at ca. 121 cm−1 is ascribed to elemental tellurium, supporting the presence of telluride in CoTe2 and the CoTe2/G composite.34 The Raman spectra of GO and the CoTe2/G composite both exhibit two characteristic main peaks: the D band at 1340 cm−1 and the G band at 1580 cm−1. The intensity ratio of D to G band (ID/IG) increases from 0.85 for the GO to 1.28 for CoTe2/G, which is caused by formation of unrepaired defects during the reduction of graphene oxide to graphene by the solvothermal treatment.35
To further reveal the elemental chemical state of the composite, XPS measurement is carried out. The XPS survey region (Fig. S6†) of the CoTe2/G composite reveals that it is composed of Co, Te, C and O. In the Co 2p spectrum (Fig. 4a), the Co 2p3/2 peak can be well fitted into two peaks at 778.5 and 781.1 eV. The peak at 778.5 eV is attributed to CoTe2.24,25 The other peak at 781.1 eV is from the oxide of cobalt on the surface of CoTe2,36 which agrees well with subsequent analysis of the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 4d). In the Te 3d spectrum (Fig. 4b), the Te 3d5/2 peak can be well fitted into two peaks at 573.0 and 576.1 eV. The peak at 573.0 eV is attributed to CoTe2, whereas the other peak at 576.1 eV results from the oxide of telluride on the surface of CoTe2 due to the exposure of the sample to air.24,25 The C 1s spectra of the CoTe2/G composite and graphene nanosheets (GNS) (Fig. 4c) can be fitted into three peaks at 284.8, 286.3 and 288.2 eV, which are referred to as C–C/CC, C–O and CO groups, respectively.17,37 The strong C–C/CC bond peak in the CoTe2/G composite also indicates the reduction of graphene oxide to graphene during the preparation process.35
 Fig. 4  XPS spectra of (a) Co 2p, (b) Te 3d, (c) C 1s and (d) O 1s for the CoTe2/G composite and graphene nanosheets (GNS) obtained by the removal of CoTe2 in the CoTe2/G composite. 
Strong interfacial interaction between CoTe2 nanoparticles and GNS can also be confirmed by XPS measurements. The O 1s spectrum (Fig. 4d) of the GNS has two peaks at 533.8 and 531.9 eV, which are attributed to C–O and CO groups, respectively. The O 1s spectrum of the CoTe2/G composite has three peaks at 533.8, 532.3 and 530.6 eV. The peaks at 533.8 eV and 530.6 eV are attributed to the C–O groups on graphene and the oxide of cobalt on the surface of CoTe2 nanoparticles, respectively. When compared with the peak in the O 1s spectrum of GNS, the dominant peak at 532.3 eV mainly belongs to C–O–Co bonds, which is formed by the reaction between oxygen-containing groups and CoTe2.38,39 This result indicates that there is a strong covalent interaction between CoTe2 nanoparticles and graphene, which enhances electron transfer and alleviates volume changes when the material is used as an anode material for SIBs, and this is in accordance with the results of previous reports about transition-metal chalcogenide/graphene such as Co0.85Se/graphene38 and Bi2S3/graphene.40
Subsequently, the electrochemical performances of the CoTe2/G composite and the CoTe2 nanoparticles are evaluated as anode materials for SIBs. The cyclic voltammetry (CVs) measurements of the CoTe2/G composite and CoTe2 nanoparticles during the first three cycles at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 are carried out to investigate their electrochemical reactions (Fig. 5a and b). Clearly, there is a distinct reduction peak at around 0.83 V and a sharp oxidation peak at around 1.65 V in the first scan curve of the bare CoTe2 particles. The reduction peak of the pure CoTe2 nanoparticles shifts to a higher potential of ca. 1.13 V and transforms into a broad peak from the second cycle, which is attributed to the formation of ultrafine CoTe2 nanocrystals during the first cycle.17,41 However, CV curves are overlapped with each other from the second cycle onwards, indicating good stable reversibility for Na-ion storage. The CoTe2/G composite exhibits two additional reduction peaks at ca. 0.01 and 0.5 V in the cathodic scan of the first CV curve when compared with pure CoTe2 nanoparticles. The peak at 0.5 V disappears during the subsequent cycle, indicating that this peak is irreversible, which is attributed to the irreversible reactions between the functional groups on the graphene matrix and electrolyte.8,21,42,43 For the reduction peak at 0.01 V, there is also a corresponding oxidation peak presented at ca. 0.08 V. The pair of reduction/oxidation peaks is attributed to Na-ion storage in the graphene layers.42 Besides, the oxidation/reduction peaks belonging to CoTe2 in the composite are consistent with those in the bare CoTe2 nanoparticles.
 Fig. 5  CV curves of the (a) pure CoTe2 and (b) CoTe2/G composite at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1; the initial three charge/discharge curves of the (c) pure CoTe2 and (d) CoTe2/G composite at a current density of 0.05 A g−1. 
The initial three discharge and charge cycle profiles of the pure CoTe2 nanoparticles and CoTe2/G composite at a current density of 0.05 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 5c and d, respectively. We can clearly observe that the discharge and charge curves of the two samples are also similar with each other, both owning one discharge plateau and one charge plateau for each discharge/charge cycle. The long plateaus at 0.83 and 1.63 V are observed in the first discharge and charge process, respectively. Comparing with the first discharge plateau, the discharge plateaus for two samples shift to a higher potential of ca. 1.2 V after the second cycle, whereas the charge plateau remains unchanged. The variation of the discharge plateau is consistent with that of the reduction peak in the CV measurement, which should be attributed to the formation of ultrafine CoTe2 nanocrystals during the first cycle.17,41 Besides, pure CoTe2 shows a wider plateau range than the CoTe2/G composite, which is due to two reasons: on the one hand, the graphene nanosheets have a certain capacity contribution; on the other hand, the crystallinity of pure CoTe2 is higher than that of CoTe2/G, which can be verified from previous reports.44,45
To clarify the Na-ion storage mechanism of CoTe2, variations of microstructures of CoTe2 in the composite are investigated by ex situ XRD (Fig. S7†), HRTEM images and SAED patterns (Fig. 6) via disassembling the cell after fully discharging to 0.01 V and charging to 2.8 V. At the fully discharged state, the ex situ XRD pattern (Fig. S7†) shows that the peaks of the metallic Co and Na2Te can be clearly observed. Simultaneously, the rings in the SAED patterns (Fig. 6a) are well indexed to the metallic Co and Na2Te phases. The HRTEM measurement also exhibits consistent results with the above ex situ XRD and SAED results. As shown in Fig. 6c, multicrystalline phase regions can be clearly observed in which the lattice fringe with 0.216 nm interplanar spacing is indexed to the (100) plane of the Co metal, whereas the lattice fringes of 0.365, 0.260 and 0.222 nm correspond to the (200), (220) and (311) planes of Na2Te. After recharging to 2.8 V, the diffraction peaks of the CoTe2 phase can be observed again in the ex situ XRD pattern (Fig. S7†). The clear rings of the CoTe2 phase are observed in the SAED pattern (Fig. 6b). The HRTEM image (Fig. 6d) also indicates recovery of CoTe2. Noticeably, these CoTe2 nanoparticles, composed of clusters having size less than 5 nm, do not recover the original highly crystalline structures. This result explains the shift of the reduction peak to a high potential after the first cycle in the CV curves. We can also analyse the Na-ion storage mechanism from the CV curves: during the first discharge process, the reduction peak located at around 0.83 V is attributed to the formation of metallic Co nanocrystals and Na2Te by a conversion reaction of CoTe2 and Na ions. During the subsequent charging process, the oxidation peak located at approximately 1.65 V is attributed to the formation of CoTe2. Corresponding electrochemical reaction mechanisms of CoTe2 for Na-ion storage are shown as follows:

Discharge process: CoTe2 + 4Na+ + 4e−1 → Co + 2Na2Te(1)
Charge process: Co + 2Na2Te → CoTe2 + 4Na+ + 4e−1(2)
The initial discharge and charge gravimetric capacities of the CoTe2/G composite are 489 and 382 mA h g−1, respectively, whereas those of pure CoTe2 are 396 mA h g−1 and 340 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1, respectively. The CoTe2/G composite has a slightly lower initial coulombic efficiency (78.1%) than pure CoTe2 nanoparticles (85.8%) due to the high irreversible capacity loss of graphene for Na-ion storage.17 The reversible capacity of graphene nanosheets obtained after the removal of CoTe2 in the composite is ca. 180 mA h g−1 (Fig. S8†). According to the mass content of CoTe2, it can be estimated that the actual deliverable reversible capacity of CoTe2 in the composite is 426 mA h g−1 (the relative calculation process can be seen in the ESI†). The reversible capacity of CoTe2 in the composite is higher than the theoretical capacity of CoTe2 (341 mA h g−1; 4 mol Na+ for 1 mol CoTe2). Similar phenomenon is also observed in other TMTe materials, which is attributed to the excess storage of the Na ion in interfaces and/or defective sites.18 In addition, the strong interfacial interaction between CoTe2 and graphene can play a critical role in improving the capacity of the CoTe2/G composite due to the synergistic effect.38,40 However, there exists no strong interfacial interactions and interfacial defect sites in the pure CoTe2 nanoparticles; thus, the reversible capacity of CoTe2 nanoparticles is not higher than the theoretical capacity of CoTe2 nanoparticles. The CoTe2/G composite also shows a more stable cycle performance when compared with pure CoTe2 (Fig. 7a). The capacity of the CoTe2/G composite after 100 cycles is still up to 356 mA h g−1, corresponding to a high capacity retention of ca. 93.2%. In contrast, the capacity of the pure CoTe2 nanoparticles after 30 cycles decreases rapidly to 63 mA h g−1.

The CoTe2/G composite also possesses a much better rate performance than pure CoTe2 (Fig. 7b). It can be seen that the reversible capacity of pure CoTe2 nanoparticles quickly falls to 47 mA h g−1 with the increase of current density to 0.5 A g−1. In contrast, the reversible capacity of the CoTe2/G composite has almost no fading from 0.05 to 0.5 A g−1, and the capacity is still maintained at 314 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1; even at high current densities of 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, the reversible capacities are still maintained at 295, 272 and 246 mA h g−1, respectively. Notably, when turned back to 0.05 A g−1 after 70 cycles, the reversible capacity of 352 mA h g−1 can be maintained without obvious capacity loss, revealing an excellent rate capability. When compared with previously reported TMTe materials (Table S2†), the CoTe2/G composite electrode exhibits a comparable and even superior rate performance in sodium-ion storage.17–20
When compared with the gravimetric capacity, the volumetric capacity can be a more important parameter to evaluate electrode materials in the future design of smart electronic devices and electric vehicles.12,13 Volumetric specific capacity can be calculated according to the following formula: CV = Q/V = Q/(m/ρ) = (Q/m) × ρ = Cm × ρ(3)in the formula, CV is volumetric specific capacity, Q is capacity, V is the volume of active materials, m is the mass of active materials, ρ is the tap density of active materials, and Cm is the gravimetric specific capacity. According to this formula, the volumetric specific capacity can be calculated by the multiplying gravimetric capacity and tap density of the active materials.20 Although their densities are lower than the 7.92 g cm−3 density of bulk CoTe2, the tap densities of pure CoTe2 nanoparticles and the CoTe2/G composite are still as high as 4.01 and 1.82 g cm−3, respectively; the values are comparable to those of SnTe (3.86 g cm−3) and SnTe/C (2.02 g cm−3), respectively, and they are obviously higher than those of graphite (1.27 g cm−3) and hard carbon (0.86 g cm−3).20 The corresponding volumetric capacities of the CoTe2/G composite and the CoTe2 nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 7d–f. The initial discharge and charge volumetric capacities of the CoTe2/G composite are 889.9 and 695.2 mA h cm−3, which are lower than those of bare CoTe2 (1587.9 and 1363.4 mA h cm−3), because the tap density of CoTe2/G is much less than that of CoTe2. Notably, after 100 cycle, the reversible volumetric capacity of CoTe2/G still remains at 647.9 mA h cm−3, whereas that of CoTe2 is decreased to ca. 127.8 mA h cm−3 (Fig. 7d).
Although several TMTe anode materials for SIBs have been prepared, their volumetric capacities have not received much attention. Up to now, only Park et al.20 reported that SnTe/C exhibited a gravimetric capacity of 316 mA h g−1 and a volumetric capacity of 639 mA h cm−3 after 100 cycles at 0.05 A g−1. In addition, Li et al. reported that MoS2/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite films exhibited a gravimetric capacity of 393–420 mA h g−1 and a volumetric capacity of 655–700 mA h cm−3.13 Both the gravimetric and volumetric capacities are comparable with those of the reported SnTe/C and MoS2/CNTs composite films. In Li's study, there were no rate volumetric capacity values for MoS2/CNTs composite films.13 Furthermore, the volumetric capacities of the CoTe2/G composite at a high rate were much better than those of SnTe/C (Fig. 7e). The SnTe/C composite delivered volumetric capacities of 490, 455 and 430 mA h cm−3 at the current densities of 0.32 (1C), 0.64 (2C) and 0.96 (3C) A g−1, respectively. At current densities of 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, the CoTe2/G composite showed volumetric capacities as high as 527.8, 495.1 and 447.7 mA h cm−3, respectively, corresponding to ca. 75.9%, 74.9% and 67.7% of the volumetric capacity at 0.05 A g−1. Moreover, after 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1, the reversible gravimetric and volumetric capacities remained at 245 mA h g−1 and 445.9 mA h cm−3 (Fig. 7c and f), respectively, revealing the superior high-rate long-term cycling stability.
Based on the above results, the CoTe2/G composite shows excellent rate performance and long-term cycle stability for both gravimetric and volumetric Na-ion storage. To clarify the possible reasons, the electrochemical dynamics of the CoTe2/G electrode are further analysed by considering the possible Na-ion storage behaviour. CV curves with different scan rates for the CoTe2/G composite are recorded from 0.1 to 1.5 mV s−1 (Fig. 7g). The power-law relationship between the peak current (i) and sweep rate (v) is as follows:46 i = avb(4)
The formula (4) can be transformed as follows: log(i) = blog(v) + log(a)(5)here, a and b are variable constants. When b is close to 1, it indicates a surface-controlled pseudocapacitive process; moreover, b value of 0.5 indicates a semi-infinite linear ionic diffusion.47,48 The b values for the reduction peak (1) and oxidation peak (2) are 0.804 and 0.722 (Fig. 7h), respectively, which are closer to 1. These results indicate that a surface-controlled capacitive process occurs in the CoTe2/G composite, which is helpful for higher rate performance.16,49 In addition, the excellent electrochemical properties of the CoTe2/G composite can be ascribed to the strong interaction of C–O–Co bonds between CoTe2 and graphene. The strongly interfacial interactions can greatly enhance electron transfer and alleviate the volume changes of the CoTe2,38,40,50 which is further supported by the EIS test (Fig. 7i). According to the equivalent circuit (Fig. S9†), the fitting results of the EIS curves (Table S1†) exhibit that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) value (41.29 Ω) of the CoTe2/G electrode is smaller than that (56.77 Ω) of the CoTe2 electrode.
Conclusions
In summary, CoTe2/G composite nanosheets are prepared by a solvothermal method. In the composite, CoTe2 nanoparticles are uniformly anchored on graphene with strong interfacial interactions. As an anode material for SIBs, the CoTe2/G composite exhibits excellent gravimetric and volumetric Na-ion storage performances including higher capacity, high rate performance, and ultrastable cyclic performance. The Na-ion storage activity of CoTe2 is based on the redox mechanism. The electrochemical dynamic analyses indicate that the Na-ion storage behaviour in the CoTe2/G composite is a surface-controlled capacitive process, which is helpful for higher rate performance. Besides, the enhanced performance of the CoTe2/G anode is ascribed to strong interfacial interaction between CoTe2 and graphene, which can effectively improve electron transfer and alleviate the volume changes of CoTe2 during the discharge/charge processes in SIBs. Despite better volumetric performance for the CoTe2/G composite, a further advancement can still occur by elaborately designing TMTes/graphene nanostructures to reduce the void spaces in the composite electrode in further studies.
