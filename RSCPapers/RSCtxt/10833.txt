    , Accepted 7th January 2017First published on 9th January 2017AbstractA novel cobalt 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalic coordination polymer has been synthesized at room temperature. With a nanosphere and lamination secondary structure, the as-prepared Co-TFBTC displayed a high capacity of 1074.6 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V versus Li/Li+. The ex situ sXAS results show that Co2+ was not involved in the lithiation reaction, which suggests the redox participation of the TFBDC ligand. The present results show promise for Co-TFBDC to be applied as high performance lithium-ion battery anodes.
Introduction
Increasing population and the increasing use of fossil fuels have now resulted in many urgent global problems including lack of fuels and environmental pollution.1 To solve these problems, clean energies (solar energy, wind energy, hydro energy etc.) and efficient energy storage devices (fuel cells, batteries, capacitors, solar cells, etc.) are greatly needed.2 To further meet the demand for miniaturization and security, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as the most important energy storage devices are well developed and widely employed in various applications (portable electronic devices, electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, electrical energy storage, etc.).3 As the relatively low theoretical capacity of commercial graphite materials (372 mA h g−1) has been the major restriction to the application of LIBs, high performance anode materials are key to the development of next-generation LIBs with high energy and power density.4 To this end, metallic oxide materials,5–10 Sn-based materials,11,12 Si-based materials,13,14 and P-based materials15–17 have been widely studied. Although their capacity is extremely high, their cycling stability is poor owing to large volume changes. It should be mentioned here that some metallic oxides, such as lithium titanate and TiO2, do not suffer from the volume expansion issue, but their capacity is quite low. Consequently, novel anode materials with high capacities and high stabilities are still greatly needed.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) or coordination polymers (CPs) with tunable metal centers and organic linkers are designed to meet various practical demands including gas storage and separation, sensing, catalysis, and drug delivery. Recently, the investigation of MOFs for use in LIBs has been expanding rapidly and attracted tremendous attention. MOF-177 was the first well-defined MOF material employed in Li-ion batteries.18 However, due to the irreversible conversion from Zn(II) to Zn(0) and the structure destruction after lithium storage, its cycling capacity is limited. K. Saravanan and co-workers reported the use of formic acid based MOFs as anode materials.19 With a reversible conversion reaction between Zn(II) and Zn(0) and the formation of a LiZn alloy, a capacity of 560 mA h g−1 was obtained by Zn3(HCOO)6 after 60 cycles.
Recently, benzene carboxylic acids have been largely employed as organic ligands for synthesizing MOFs or CPs with high reversible capacities, such as Co2(OH)2BDC,20,21 BiCPs,22 Mn-BTC,23 CoBTC,24 Cu-BTC,25 and MnCo-BTC26 (Table 1). In fact, there are numerous factors which can affect the reversible capacities including synthesis solvents,24 coordinating solvents,27 addition agents,21 hybrid metals22 and organic ligands. Aggregated large bulk Co2(OH)2BDC originally shows a reversible capacity of 650 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1 after 100 cycles.20 In our recent work, we optimized the synthetic method by introducing PVP as an electrolyte additive and the optimized hierarchical Co2(OH)2BDC displayed a much higher reversible capacity of 1021 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 200 cycles, which is attributed to both pseudocapacitive processes and intercalation reactions.21

Although much effort has been made to enhance the capacity and the rate performance, the extent to which modifications of the synthesis can affect the resulting performance is still an open question.
In this work, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalic acid (H2TFBDC) and cobalt based Co-TFBDC was synthesized and tested as an anode in LIBs. Because of the ultra-strong electron withdrawing ability of fluorine, the hydrogens easily depart in the state of H+, leading to the strong acidity of H2TFBDC which will disturb the coordination in MOFs. Therefore, alkalis or pH inhibitors are needed to adjust the pH to achieve a higher degree of deprotonation.41 Two-dimensional (2D) Mn-LCP ([Mn-(tfbdc)(4,4′-bpy)(H2O)2]) was synthesized with H2TFBDC and 4,4′-bipyridine(4,4′-bpy) (serving as pH inhibitors & other linkers). As a result of the relatively high molecular weight (Mr = 483), a low reversible capacity of 390 mA h g−1 was maintained. When the metal changes to cobalt, the isomorphic Co-LCP could maintain a reversible capacity of 545 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles owing to its layered nanosheet morphology. In this work, we synthesized Co-TFBDC at room temperature using ammonium hydroxide as a pH inhibitor. With an amorphous nanosphere and lamination secondary structure, the as-prepared Co-TFBDC shows an ultrahigh capacity of 1074.6 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current of 100 mA g−1.
Experimental details
Synthetic method of Co-TFBDC
In a typical synthesis procedure, Co(NO3)2·6H2O (5 mmol, Aladdin, 99.99%) and H2TFBDC (5 mmol, J&K, 97%) were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water solution and stirred for 15 minutes (800 rpm) for complete dispersion, resulting in purple transparent solution (pH = 1.2). Then, 2 mL ammonia water (Sinopharm, 40% NH3·H2O, AR) was added dropwise into the solution with slow stirring (300 rpm). After 5 minute standing (pH = 9.1), the liquid supernatant of the mixture was removed. Subsequently, the product was washed with deionized water three times to remove surplus reactants. A green powder of Co-TFBDC was obtained after drying in an oven at 70 °C for 12 h. The overall yield was about 85%.
Materials characterization
A Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray Diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (V = 35 kV, I = 25 mA, λ = 1.5418 Å) was used to analyze the crystal phase of the as-prepared materials in the 2θ range 5°–50° at a scanning rate of 15° min−1. N2 sorption isotherms and BET surface area were measured at 77 K using a 02108-KR-1 system (Quantachrome) after outgassing at 150 °C for 12 hours. SEM images were taken using a Hitachi S-2400 scanning electron microscope (Japan). TG that ranges from room temperature to 800 °C was recorded on a STA 449 F3 Jupiter® simultaneous thermo-analyzer (NETZSCH Gerätebau GmbH) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in the air. A Nexus670 infrared spectrometer (Nicolet) was used to perform Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis in the wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm−1 in the transmission mode. A Burker AVANCE-III WB 400 M spectrometer was used to collect solid-state 13C NMR spectra with samples packed into 4 mm rotors. XPS spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmerPHI 5000C ESCA spectrometer operating at 250 W (Al–Kα radiation = 1486.6 eV, pass energy = 93.9 eV). Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) was performed at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, BL08U1A). In ex situ studies, the battery cells were firstly cycled to the desired states-of-charge (SOC) at a current density of 100 mA g−1 and then disassembled in an argon filled glove box with oxygen and water less than 0.1 ppm. The Co-TFBDC electrodes were subsequently drawn out from the cells and washed with anhydrous dimethyl carbonate (DMC) several times. After drying for 12 h at room temperature in the argon filled glove box, all the electrodes were carefully sealed for further tests.
Electrochemical testing
All the electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature. The active material (weight ratio: 70%), the conducting additive (Super-P carbon black, weight ratio: 20%) and the binder (polyacrylic acid or PAA, weight ratio: 10%) were homogenously mixed in deionized water (solvent) and stirred for at least 3 h to produce a slurry. Then, the obtained slurry was coated onto Cu foil and dried at 70 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. The electrodes were punched into round plates (diameter of 14.0 mm). The loading of the as-prepared electrodes is about ∼1.0 mg cm−2. 1 M LiPF6 in EC–DMC–EMC (1:1:1 in volume) was used as the electrolyte. Finally, a coin cell (CR2032) was assembled by the as-prepared anode, a Celgard 2325 separator (diameter of 19.0 mm), a pure lithium wafer (counter electrode and reference electrode), and an electrolyte in an argon filled glove box with oxygen and water less than 0.1 ppm. The galvanostatic charge and discharge and rate tests were performed on a LAND 2001A battery test system in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V versus Li/Li+. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) testing was carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660e) at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V versus Li/Li+. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660e) in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV.
Results and discussion
Characterization of Co-TFBDC
Co-TFBDC in this work was synthesized through a facile solvent method at room temperature with Co(NO3)2·6H2O and H2TFBDC (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalic acid). The XRD of the as-prepared Co-TFBDC is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), which shows similar diffraction peaks to Co2(OH)2BDC in the low angle. Therefore the structure might be similar to the Co2(OH)2BDC, which is composed of edge-sharing CoO6 octahedrons that are linked to each other to form layers that are further connected together by organic bridges. FTIR spectra of Co-TFBDC and H2TFBDC are shown in Fig. 1a. It can be observed that the characteristic band (νCO, 1707 cm−1) of H2TFBDC disappears in the spectrum of Co-TFBDC and new peaks appear due to coordination between Co2+ and TFBDC2−. The peaks at 1624 cm−1 can be attributed to asymmetric stretching vibrations of –COO− and peaks at 1452 cm−1 and 1388 cm−1 to the symmetric stretching vibrations. Besides, the bands at 746 cm−1 represent the out of plane vibration of 1,4-substituted benzene of the linker molecules (out of plane C–F bending modes). These results proved that the cobalt ions have been successfully coordinated with the deprotonated TFBDC2− ligands. Similar observations have also been presented for Mn based Mn-LCP39 and Co-based Co-LCP.42 Thermogravimetric analysis was employed to investigate the thermal behavior of Co-TFBDC as shown in Fig. 1b. The continuous weight loss before 122 °C corresponds to the loss of the coordinated solvent (H2O molecules). The rapid weight loss between 122 °C and 257 °C can be attributed to decomposition of the Co-TFBDC skeleton. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm is convex in nature up to P/P0 = 1.0 as plotted in Fig. 1e. A typical III isotherm with a H4 hysteresis loop starting from P/P0 = 0.47 demonstrates the presence of interlaminar pores. A high surface area of 139.85 m2 g−1 and a total pore volume of 0.6411 cm3 g−1 were evaluated by the adsorption isotherms from which the micro area and volume were also calculated to be 22.90 m2 g−1 and 0.011 cm3 g−1, respectively. The relatively high surface area could be mainly associated with constructional void porosity. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method was used for calculating the corresponding pore size distribution of the adsorption branch. As shown in Fig. 1d, the pore distribution range from 3 nm to 110 nm shows a mean pore diameter of 3.158 nm, which indicates the coexistence of micropores, mesopores, and macropores. It is noted here that the large surface area and porous framework of Co-TFBDC make it potential for applications such as supercapacitors and LIBs, because they both favor the ion transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In addition, the survey of the XPS spectra demonstrated the coexistence of Co, C, F and O (Fig. S3, ESI†). The valency of Co2+ is evident from Fig. 1f which shows the Co 2p1/2 peak and its satellite peak at 797.28 and 803.08 eV with the Co 2p3/2 peak and its satellite peak located at 781.28 and 786.58 eV. The solid-state 13C NMR spectrum of Co-TFBDC is shown in Fig. S4, ESI.† Because of the strong Fermi contact interactions between linker atoms and metal centers, only a very broad peak (FWHM, ∼100 ppm) centered at 165 ppm is observed in contrast with well-defined chemical shifts of H2TFBDC.

Fig. 2 presents the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images at different magnifications. We can clearly see the uniform nanosphere structure of Co-TFBDC (<1 μm) in Fig. 2a. In Fig. 2b, it is observed that the nanospheres are accumulated by disordered lamination as the secondary structure. One of them was selected to measure the size of the nanosphere (∼660 nm) as well as the lamination (30–35 nm) (Fig. 2c). It is noteworthy that the well-unified secondary structure may improve electrolyte accessibility and minimize the diffusion distances to the interior surfaces leading to further improved capability by forming an ion-buffering reservoir in the interlamination. The elementary composition of Co-TFBDC was investigated by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings (Fig. S5, ESI†). The homogeneous coexistence and distribution of Co, O, C, and F are proved in Fig. 2c–f. The EDS analysis over the selected region from Table S1, ESI† showed that the content of Co was approximately 45% which coincides well with the TGA results (60% Co3O4 retained at 800 °C, Fig. S2, ESI†).

Electrochemical performances of Co-TFBDC

Fig. 3a shows the CV curves of the Co-TFBDC electrode at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. During the cathodic scan, two contiguous peaks centered at 0.64 V can be attributed to the lithiation of Co-TFBDC and the formation of a SEI film that results in a large irreversible capacity in the first cycle. At the second cathodic scan, two peaks could be attributed to the Li+ insertion into different moieties of Co-TFBDC. During the anodic scans, two peaks at 1.39 V and 2.06 V can be attributed to the delithiation of the Co-TFBDC electrode.

(f) Rate performance of Co-TFBDC at different current densities. 
The cycling behaviours of Co-TFBDC were firstly evaluated at 100 mA g−1 in the voltage range from 0.01 V to 3.0 V versus Li/Li+. As shown in Fig. 3b, a long plateau at 1.25–1.0 V, followed by a broad sloping curve below 1.0 V, respectively, corresponded to the formation of SEI films and the lithiation of Co-TFBDC. The charge–discharge profiles at 10th, 20th, 30th, 40th and 50th are almost coincident indicating the reversible charge–discharge processes. And the long plateau at 1.25–1.0 V disappeared indicating the stabilization of SEI films.
When tested at a current density of 100 mA g−1, the Co-TFBDC electrode showed a high discharge capacity of 1699.8 mA h g−1 and a charge capacity of 938.9 mA h g−1 during the first cycle with an initial coulombic efficiency of 55.24% resulting from the formation of SEI films and other irreversible reactions.43 It is remarkable that a high capacity of 968.4 mA h g−1 was obtained at the second cycle, which increased gradually to 1074.6 mA h g−1 at the 50th cycle showing a capacity retention of 63.22%. To our knowledge, this should be one of the best LIB performances among MOF and CP-based anode materials reported at such a rate. When tested at a higher current of 1000 mA g−1, the Co-TFBDC electrode maintains a capacity of 501.4 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. This further indicates its good cycling stability even at a large current density. The exact chemical formula of Co-TFBDC is not determined. However, we anticipate that the chemical formula should be like Co2(OH)2TFBDC, which has a theoretical capacity of 1105 mA h g−1.

Fig. 3e displayed the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of Co-TFBDC in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 106 Hz with an AC amplitude of 5 mV at various cycling intervals. The solution resistance (Rs) increased gradually from 9.83 Ω (fresh) to 10.58 Ω (after 1 cycle), 11.08 Ω (after 10 cycles), and 11.23 Ω (after 50 cycles), indicating great electrochemical stability during cycles. For the better wetting of the electrodes and improved connectivity, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) decreased from 232.9 Ω (fresh) to 155.1 Ω (after 1 cycle), 148.1 Ω (after 10 cycles), and 143.8 Ω (after 50 cycles).
To further explore the electrochemical capability of Co-TFBDC, its rate performance was also tested as shown in Fig. 3f. The reversible capacities obtained were 1051.4, 904.32, 698.0, and 469.7 mA h g−1 at 100, 200, 500 and 1000 mA g−1, respectively. When the current returned to 100 mA g−1, the capacity could recover to 1074.0 mA h g−1 indicating an excellent electrochemical stability at high rates. Compared with another 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalic acid based material (Co-LCP) which maintained a capacity of about 430 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and 148 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1, the as-prepared Co-TFBDC electrode shows higher capacity, better cycling stability, and superior rate performance.
To further explore the Li storage mechanism, ex situ XPS (Fig. S6, ESI†) was performed to determine the electronic state of Co in the Co-TFBDC electrode at three different states: fresh, discharged to 0.01 V, and charged to 3.0 V. It is shown that no obvious peaks could be distinguished for the discharged Co2+observed. The poor resolution could be attributed to the formation of SEI films (mostly the sample in contrast with high-quality Co2+ spectral features of the fresh electrode. At the charged state, a very-weak signal of thickness >10 nm) that is inhibited from surface sensitive XPS observations for which most of the signal only comes from a few atomic layers of the surface. Ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) was employed to investigate whether the Co2+ state changes or not during the discharge process. Other than XPS, sXAS does not suffer from low efficiency of emitted electrons in the deeper position of the electrode. In our case, no discernible changes could be observed in the Co L-edges spectra of the fresh and discharged electrodes (Fig. 4), indicating that the state of Co2+ was retained after discharge. This should indicate an intercalation mechanism and the redox participation of the TFBDC ligand. Therefore, the TFBDC ligand plays a key role in lithiation/delithiation processes of the high-performance Co-TFBDC electrode.

Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized a cobalt (Co) and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalic (TFBDC) based coordination polymer (Co-TFBDC) at room-temperature. With a secondary structure of nanospheres and laminations, the Co-TFBDC displayed an ultrahigh capacity of 1074.6 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Ex situ studies suggest that although the long range structure was not retained, Co2+ was not involved in the lithiation reaction. Therefore, the TFBDC ligand should play an important role in the excellent Li-storage capability. We anticipate that a further improvement in Li-storage performance of coordination polymers/metal–organic frameworks (CPs/MOFs) may be feasible by introducing more carboxyl groups into benzene based ligands (e.g. benzene hexacarboxylic acid).
