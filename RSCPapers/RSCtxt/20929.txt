However, only Co/Ni-based ternary sulfides have been explored as counter electrode (CE) materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Herein, CEs fabricated using Ag8GeS6 nanocrystal ink exhibited efficient electrocatalytic activity in the reduction of I3− to I− in DSSCs. The DSSC with the Ag8GeS6 CE displayed a higher power conversion efficiency of 8.10% than that with the Pt CE (8.02%). Moreover, the devices also showed the characteristics of fast activity onset, high multiple start/stop capability and good irradiation stability. The results indicated that the developed Ag8GeS6 CE could be a promising alternative to Pt CEs in DSSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have recently attracted great attention owing to their easy fabrication and cost-effectiveness.1,2 As a crucial component, the counter electrode (CE) plays an important role in the performance of DSSCs, which collects electrons from the external circuit and fulfills electron transfer from the CE to the electrolyte by catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−. Ideally, CE materials should possess low resistance, high electrocatalytic activity and excellent chemical stability.3,4 Currently, platinum-loaded (Pt) conducting glass is widely exploited as a CE for DSSCs. However, Pt could dissolve in the electrolyte and create by-products because of the corrosive I−/I3− redox electrolyte, such as PtI4 and H2PtI6,5,6 which would deteriorate the long term stability of DSSCs. Therefore, tremendous research is focused on the development of efficient and stable alternatives to Pt.7–16 Binary transition metal sulfides were widely studied since CoS was first developed as a CE material for DSSCs, due to its foreseeable electrocatalytic ability toward I3− reduction.4,6,17–21 However, further development of CE materials for DSSCs is limited by the small number of suitable binary sulfides available. On the other hand, ternary metal sulfides would provide more alternatives and tune physicochemical properties due to the existence of two cations.22 Until now, only Co/Ni-based ternary sulfides have been explored as CE materials for DSSCs.22–25
Recently, a Ag8SnS6 CE was fabricated for DSSCs by our group,26 and showed impressive electrocatalytic activity and stability in catalyzing I3− reduction. However, the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs based on Ag8SnS6 CEs was still poor compared with that of DSSCs with Pt CEs. Cartledge et al. considered that a higher ionic potential could cause higher polarizability,27–29 which could promote the adsorption of I3− on CE materials and enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency of CEs in DSSCs. So Ag8GeS6 would be a potential CE material due to its higher ionic potential (effective static potential of the cation) of Ge4+ compared with Sn4+. Recently, Zhang et al. first reported a colloidal process to synthesize Ag8GeS6 nanocrystals using GeI4 as a Ge precursor.30 Herein, Ag8GeS6 nanocrystal ink was prepared from a mixture of oleylamine (OAm) and 1-octadecene (ODE) with AgNO3, GeCl4 and sulfur as precursors, and used to fabricate CEs for DSSCs for the first time. It is noteworthy that the DSSC with the Ag8GeS6 CE displayed a power conversion efficiency of 8.10%, superior to that of the DSSC with the Pt CE (8.02%).
Results and discussion
Typical XRD patterns (Fig. 1) indicate that the obtained products correspond to argyrodite Ag8GeS6 (JCPDS no. 83-1427). The TEM image shows that the as-prepared Ag8GeS6 is monodispersed nanocrystals with a size of about 7.5 nm (Fig. 2a and S1, see ESI†). The HRTEM image reveals that the obtained nanocrystals are highly crystalline, and the interplanar distance of 0.305 nm corresponds to the (022) plane of argyrodite Ag8GeS6 (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the as-synthesized Ag8GeS6 nanocrystals can be easily dispersed into chloroform to form a stable ink, which can be stable for at least one month (Fig. S2†).

In order to investigate the formation mechanism of Ag8GeS6 nanocrystals, the products prepared at different stages were collected and characterized by XRD (Fig. S3†). When a mixture of AgNO3, GeCl4, OAm and ODE was vigorously stirred and degassed by pulling vacuum in a flask, chlorargyrite AgCl was formed. The color of solution turned from white to black after the injection of the sulfur precursor, corresponding to the formation of acanthite Ag2S. When the temperature was increased to 140 °C, a mixture of Ag2S and Ag8GeS6 was obtained, which was inferred from the (022) peak of canfieldite Ag8GeS6. Upon further increasing the reaction temperature from 140 to 190 °C, the main peak ((−121) peak) of Ag2S was becoming weaker, and the main peak ((022) peak) of Ag8GeS6 was gradually becoming stronger, which means the formation of Ag8GeS6 with the disappearance of Ag2S. Based on the above experimental results, the formation of Ag8GeS6 nanocrystals can be proposed. AgCl nanoparticles were formed in the mixed solution, and Ag2S formed immediately once the sulfur precursor was injected. With the increase of reaction temperature, Ge4+ progressively exchanged with Ag+ in Ag2S and finally evolved into Ag8GeS6 nanocrystals at about 190 °C. Thus the formation of Ag8GeS6 nanocrystals is mainly attributed to cation-exchange reactions that occur in silver-based chalcogenides, in which Ag+ in ionic materials with high-density cation vacancies in the rigid sublattice of S2− behaves like a “fluid” because of its high cationic mobility in vacancies.31–35
To fabricate Ag8GeS6 CEs (Fig. S4†), Ag8GeS6 nanocrystal ink with different concentrations (typical: 50 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto an FTO glass substrate at 800 rpm for 0.5 minutes. The top and cross-sectional SEM images show that the Ag8GeS6 thin film is densely packed with a thickness of about 0.42 μm (Fig. 2c and d). The corresponding elemental mapping images of the film reveal the homogeneous distributions of Ag, Ge and S elements.
CV was used to scrutinize the electrocatalytic activity of the Ag8GeS6 electrode towards the I−/I3− redox couple. For comparison, a Pt electrode was also studied under the same conditions. Two pairs of redox peaks are observed on both electrodes (Fig. 3a), the left pair (Ox-1/Red-1) and the right pair (Ox-2/Red-2), which correspond to the redox reactions of I−/I3− (I3− + 2e− → 3I−) and I2/I3− (3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−), respectively.9,36 As mentioned before, the CE in a DSSC serves to catalyze the reduction of I3−; thus the characteristics of the left pair are of research interest. The cathodic peak current density (JRed) and peak-to-peak (Epp) separation between anodic and cathodic peaks are important parameters for the electrocatalytic activity of CEs.9,19,37 The higher |JRed−1| (1.81 mA cm−2) and lower Epp (0.31 V) suggest that the Ag8GeS6 CE possesses better electrocatalytic activity than the Pt CE (1.75 mA cm−2 and 0.35 V, respectively).

(c) Tafel polarization curves at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 based on the same devices as in (b). (d) Current density–voltage characteristics of DSSCs based on different CEs measured at 100 mW cm−2. 
On the basis of promising CV results, the intrinsic interfacial charge transfer and charge transport kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface of CEs in DSSCs can be conveniently evaluated by EIS.19,38 The EIS measurements were carried out with symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical electrodes. The Nyquist plots were fitted with an equivalent circuit model with Z-view software (Fig. 3b and S5†) and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1 and S1† The charge transfer resistance at the electrolyte/electrode interface (Rct) was obtained by fitting the semicircle in the high-frequency region (left semicircle), while the right semicircle in the low-frequency range indicates the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the I−/I3− redox couple in the electrolyte.7,39 The smaller Rct of the Ag8GeS6 CE indicates its higher electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3− in DSSCs,19,37 which could promote the dye regeneration on photoanodes and further improve the photocurrent density of DSSCs.37 These results can also be confirmed by Tafel polarization curves (Fig. 3c). The greater slope of the J–V plot in Tafel curves indicates a higher exchange current density (J0) of the Ag8GeS6 CE than that of the Pt CE.4,19 However, the corresponding constant phase-angle element (CPE) value of the Ag8GeS6 CE is 10.02 μF, which is lower than that of the Pt CE with a CPE value of 10.41 μF. The fact may be presumably due to the smaller particles of Pt, resulting in the larger surface roughness of the Pt CE.40
Taking the results of CV, EIS and Tafel polarization into consideration, Ag8GeS6 CEs displayed higher electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of I3− compared with Pt CEs, making them potentially good performance candidates for constructing DSSCs. To further assess the above results, DSSCs were fabricated using Ag8GeS6 and Pt CEs. The photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs with various CEs are shown in Fig. 3d, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in the inset. As shown in Fig. 3d, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of DSSCs with the Ag8GeS6 CE are 16.59 mA cm−2, 746 mV and 0.65, respectively, yielding an overall energy-conversion efficiency (η) of 8.10%.
Meanwhile, the DSSC with Pt exhibits a Jsc of 16.34 mA cm−2, a Voc of 748 mV, a FF of 0.66, and a η of 8.02%. These results demonstrate that the Ag8GeS6 CE possesses better performance in DSSCs than Pt. This can be further supported by the incident photon to charge carrier efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. S8a†). Furthermore, Ag8GeS6 CEs with different thicknesses were also assembled into DSSCs. The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. S7,† and the solar cell parameters are summarized in Table S4.† The results indicate that the η of DSSCs can be improved by optimizing the thickness of Ag8GeS6 CEs.

Fig. 4a represents the Bode spectra of symmetric dummy cells with Ag8GeS6 and Pt CEs. The lifetime of electrons (τ1) in the I3− reduction at the CE/electrolyte interface can be calculated according to τ1 = 1/2πfp1,41,42 where fp1 is the peak of the high-frequency region in the spectra (Table 1). The τ1 value of the DSSC with the Ag8GeS6 CE (27.0 μs) is smaller than that of the DSSC with Pt (28.3 μs), meaning higher electrocatalytic activity towards I3− reduction. Meanwhile, the photoelectron lifetime (τ2) of the photoanode of the DSSC with the Ag8GeS6 CE (4602.2 μs) is longer than that of the photoanode of the DSSC with the Pt CE (4386.7 μs). The result implies that the Ag8GeS6 CE can facilitate the flow of electrons from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2 and can further reduce the recombination of photogenerated carriers in the photoanode (Fig. 4b).41

As a crucial component of DSSCs, CEs require fast start-up and multiple start/stop cycling for their applications. A sudden increase in the photocurrent density at “light on” and no delay in starting the cells suggest the rapid response of Pt and Ag8GeS6 CEs for I3− reduction (Fig. 5a).41 The stability of the DSSCs under prolonged irradiation was evaluated by measuring the device under sustained irradiation for 2 hours, shown in Fig. 5b. Only 2.2% of the initial photocurrent density decreases for the DSSC with the Ag8GeS6 CE compared with that with the Pt CE (7.8%). Although the DSSCs were tested for only 2 hours, the preliminary result demonstrates that their stability can be improved by employing the Ag8GeS6 CE.
 Fig. 5  (a) Start–stop switches and (b) photocurrent stabilities of the DSSCs with Ag8GeS6 and Pt electrodes. The on–off plots were obtained by alternately irradiating (100 mW cm−2) and darkening (0 mW cm−2) the DSSC devices at 0 V, whereas the photocurrent stabilities were measured under a sustained irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 at 0.45 V. 
Multiple CVs further reinforced, after 500 cycles, that the Ag8GeS6 CE was more stable than the Pt CE (Fig. 6a and b). Moreover, DSSCs with Ag8GeS6 and Pt CEs were assembled and continuously tested for fifteen days to investigate their long-term stability (Fig. 7, Fig. S9 and S10 and Tables S5 and S6†). After 15 days, the Jsc, FF and η of DSSCs with the Ag8GeS6 CE retained 81.8%, 95.4% and 78.1% of their original value, while the ones with the Pt CE are of 69.7%, 92.4% and 65.4%, respectively. If the fabricated CEs were dipped in the iodine based electrolyte for 15 days (Fig. S11 and Tables S7 and S8†) and then assembled into DSSCs, the retention rate of cells with the Ag8GeS6 CE (95.6%) is higher than that of cells with the Pt CE (91.4%). The above results further emphasize the high chemical stability of the Ag8GeS6 CE in iodine based electrolytes. Additionally, the electrochemical stability of CEs was also examined through repeated EIS measurements of 10 cycles (Fig. 6c and d). Almost no changes in Rs and ZN for all samples were found, meaning the potential cycling hardly influences the series resistance and the mass transport in the redox electrolyte solution.19 However, the Rct value increased from 2.16 to 2.63 Ω cm2 for the Ag8GeS6 CE (21.7%) and from 2.38 to 3.12 Ω cm2 for the Pt CE (31.1%), which are consistent with the above results (Fig. 7).

EIS measurements at 0 V from 100 kHz to 100 mHz were then performed. This sequential electrochemical test was repeated 10 times.

Conclusions
In summary, Ag8GeS6 nanocrystal ink was prepared via a colloidal synthesis process with simple inorganic compounds as precursors. The obtained nanocrystal ink was prepared for CEs for DSSCs. This newly developed Ag8GeS6 CE displayed lower charge transfer resistance, better chemical stability and higher catalytic activity toward I3− reduction compared with Pt CEs in DSSCs. Notably, the device consisting of the Ag8GeS6 CE displayed a η of 8.10%, superior to that of the device with the Pt CE (8.02%).
Experimental section
Materials and reagents
Silver nitrate (AgNO3, 99.9%, Shanghai Institute of Fine Chemical Materials), oleylamine (OAm, 70%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1-octadecene (ODE, 90%, Alfa Aesar) and sublimed sulfur (99.5%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) were purchased and used as received without further purification. Transparent conductive glass (F-doped SnO2, FTO, 15 Ω sq.−1, transmittance of 80%) was purchased from Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co., Ltd.
Preparation of Ag8GeS6 nanocrystal ink
In a typical synthesis process, 2 mmol of AgNO3 (0.340 g) and 0.25 mmol GeCl4 (30 μL) were dissolved in a mixture of OAm (1.0 mL) and ODE (9.0 mL) by vigorous stirring and degassing in a three-neck flask at 60 °C for 30 minutes. Then the above system was heated to 140 °C in 20 minutes under a nitrogen atmosphere. After a mixture of sublimed sulfur (2.5 mmol) and OAm (2.5 mL) was immediately injected into the three-neck flask with a syringe, the reaction system was heated to 200 °C at a rate of 4 °C min−1 and maintained for 30 minutes. Then the flask was removed from the heating mantle and cooled to room temperature naturally. Finally, precipitates were collected after 30 mL of ethanol was added to the reactant solution, followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes. Then the precipitate was redispersed in chloroform. Prior to characterization, dispersions were typically centrifuged again at 8000 rpm for 5 minutes to remove inadequately capped particles.
Preparation of counter electrodes
CEs were prepared by spin-coating the solution of the as-prepared products (SpinMaster 100, Chemat Technology, Inc.) onto a cleaned FTO glass substrate. The thicknesses of the CEs were controlled by the concentrations of the as-synthesized nanocrystals in chloroform (10, 20, 50 and 120 mg L−1). Then the coated substrates were placed on a hot plate (60 °C) for 10 minutes to evaporate the volatile solvent, and subsequently sintered at 400 °C for 30 minutes in a nitrogen atmosphere (air for Pt CE). After being annealed, the films were slowly cooled to room temperature.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
Photoanodes were purchased from Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co., Ltd. TiO2 films (∼15 μm in thickness) containing transparent (∼11 μm) and scattering (∼4 μm) layers with an apparent area of 0.16 cm2 were used. TiO2 films were immersed into 5 mmol L−1 ethanol solution of ruthenium 535 bis-TBA (N719, Solaronix SA) for 24 hours. The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode and the as-prepared CE were separated by a hot-melt Surlyn film (60 μm thick) and sealed by hot-pressing. The cell internal space was filled with electrolytes using a vacuum pump. The redox electrolyte composed of 0.03 mol L−1 of I2, 0.6 mol L−1 of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.5 mol L−1 of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 0.1 mol L−1 of guanidinium thiocyanate with anhydrous acetonitrile as the solvent was used.7 Finally, the holes on the back of CEs were sealed with a Surlyn film covered with a thin glass slide under heat.
Characterization
The phase of the as-prepared products was characterized on a powder XRD (Shimadzu XRD-6000) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scanning rate of 6° min−1 (2θ from 20° to 60°). The morphology and crystal lattice of samples were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL, JEM-2100). The top/cross-sectional morphologies and energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX) of Ag8GeS6 CEs were examined by using a field emission scanning electronic microscope (FESEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM NPE218).
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system containing an anhydrous acetonitrile solution of LiClO4 (0.1 mol L−1), LiI (10 mmol L−1) and I2 (1 mmol L−1) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Pt worked as the counter electrode, the as-prepared CE as the working electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. For electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the symmetrical dummy cells were assembled with two identical CEs filled with the same electrolyte (CE//electrolyte//CE) as used in the DSSCs. The active apparent area of the dummy cell was 0.36 cm2. In EIS tests, the samples were scanned from 100 kHz to 100 mHz at 0 V bias and an ac amplitude of 10 mV. The resultant impedance spectra were analyzed using the Z-view non-linear least-squares fitting program. Tafel polarization curves were recorded on the same workstation by assembling symmetrical cells. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs were recorded under the illumination of AM 1.5G simulated solar light coming from a Oriel Sol 3A solar simulator (Newport-69920) equipped with a Xe lamp (450 W) and an AM 1.5G filter with the scan direction from the open-circuit to the short-circuit at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The light intensity was calibrated using a reference Si solar cell (Oriel-91150). All the electrical data were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium CIMPS-1, Germany).

 	Fig. 5  (a) Start–stop switches and (b) photocurrent stabilities of the DSSCs with Ag8GeS6 and Pt electrodes. The on–off plots were obtained by alternately irradiating (100 mW cm−2) and darkening (0 mW cm−2) the DSSC devices at 0 V, whereas the photocurrent stabilities were measured under a sustained irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 at 0.45 V.	 

 	Fig. 6  A total of 500 consecutive CVs of (a) Ag8GeS6 and (b) Pt CEs were recorded in the I−/I3− system at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Nyquist plots of EIS data for the symmetrical cells with (c) Ag8GeS6 and (d) Pt electrodes. The cells were first subjected to CV scanning from 0 to 1 V and then from −1 to 0 V with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, followed by 20 s relaxation at 0 V. EIS measurements at 0 V from 100 kHz to 100 mHz were then performed. This sequential electrochemical test was repeated 10 times.	 

 	Fig. 7  
J–V characteristics of DSSCs with Ag8GeS6 and Pt CEs, which were dipped in an iodine electrolyte for different times.
