    , Accepted 29th October 2010First published on 6th December 2010AbstractCaustic solvents such as sodium or potassium hydroxides, converted viaCO2 capture to aqueous carbonates or bicarbonates, are a likely candidate for atmospheric CO2 separation. We have performed a comprehensive experimental investigation of CO2 gas regeneration from aqueous potassium carbonate and bicarbonate solutions using bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED). This system allows the regeneration of pure CO2 gas, suitable for subsequent sequestration or reaction to synthetic hydrocarbons and their products, from aqueous carbonate/bicarbonate solutions. Our results indicate that the energy consumption required to regenerate CO2 gas from aqueous bicarbonate (carbonate) solutions using this method can be as low as 100 kJ (200 kJ) per mol of CO2 in the small-current-density limit.

Broader context
Although the transportation sector accounts for over thirty percent of all CO2 emitted in the United States, the weight of CO2 created upon combustion makes onboard capture and storage of these emissions impractical. As a result, the ability to capture CO2 directly from the atmosphere will be required in order to control CO2 emissions from “mobile emitters” such as cars, buses, and planes. Aqueous hydroxides, converted viaCO2 capture to aqueous carbonates or bicarbonates, are likely capture-solvent candidates for atmospheric CO2 separation. We present a comprehensive experimental investigation of CO2 gas regeneration from potassium carbonate and bicarbonate solutions using bipolar membrane electrodialysis. This system allows the regeneration of pure CO2 gas, suitable for subsequent sequestration or use, from aqueous capture solutions. We demonstrate that this system can be quite efficient, with an energy consumption as low as 100 kJ per mol of CO2 from bicarbonate solutions. This approach represents an alternative to conventional regeneration approaches such as steam stripping, and is applicable to other capture solvents such as MEA.

Introduction
As the concentration of atmospheric CO2 continues to rise,1 it is becoming increasingly imperative to invent efficient and cost-effective technologies for controlling the atmospheric CO2 concentration. The most well-known approach to this problem is Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS): the separation of CO2 emissions from power-plant flue gas, followed by the pressurization and sequestration of this CO2 in long-term storage sites, such as geological formations.2
While CCS is a promising technology that will likely be relied upon in the near-term to help control the atmospheric CO2 concentration, this approach is unable to capture emissions from mobile emitters, such as cars and planes. In the future, it will prove important to control these emissions as well, considering that in 2007 the transportation sector accounted for 31.6% of all CO2 emitted in the United States.3 Moreover, since combusting one gallon of motor gasoline creates 19.4 lbs of CO2,4 it is not feasible to capture and store these emissions onboard. Consequently, capturing the emissions from mobile emitters will require the ability to capture CO2 directly from the atmosphere.
Although the relatively low concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere (about 386 ppm in 2009, rising at a rate of about 1.9 ppm per year5) makes it more energetically costly to separate CO2 from the air than from flue gas (with CO2 concentrations of about 10%), the thermodynamic minimum energy for this separation scales as the natural logarithm of the CO2 partial pressure, meaning that it only costs about 3.4 times more energy to separate CO2 from air than from flue gas, even though flue gas has a CO2 concentration that is about 260 times larger than that of air. In addition to mitigating CO2 emissions from mobile sources, separating CO2 directly from the air has other advantages, including: eliminating the need for long-distance transport of separated CO2 by co-locating capture sites near sequestration sites; the ability to synthesize hydrocarbon liquid fuels in remote locations by using available energy resources to separate CO2, generate H2, and react them to form liquid fuels;6 the ability to synthesize liquid fuels that are carbon neutral7–9 (using CO2 separated from flue gas would not create a carbon-neutral fuel because the CO2 emitted upon combustion could not be re-separated for a subsequent fuel synthesis and combustion cycle); and the ability to actually decrease the atmospheric CO2 concentration via atmospheric separation and sequestration (flue-gas capture would only slow the increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration).
Given the clear advantages and potentially modest energy penalty of separation directly from the atmosphere, research into atmospheric CO2 separation has gained momentum over the past decade, with many groups worldwide pursuing a variety of strategies.10–27 Moreover, techno-economic analysis indicates that atmospheric CO2 separation is a potentially cost-effective strategy and should be investigated at least as thoroughly as other approaches.28,29
The separation of CO2, whether from the atmosphere or from flue gas, generally involves two steps: capture and regeneration. In the capture step, CO2 is usually absorbed or adsorbed, either physically or chemically, into a solid or liquid by contacting the CO2 source (flue gas, the atmosphere, etc.) with the absorber/adsorber. In the regeneration step, CO2 is selectively removed from the absorber/adsorber, often using some combination of thermal, chemical, or electrical means, resulting in a flow of pure CO2 gas.
Although not the only option, caustic solvents such as sodium or potassium hydroxides, converted viaCO2 capture to aqueous carbonates or bicarbonates, are a likely candidate for atmospheric CO2 separation.20,24 In this paper we experimentally investigate an electrochemical approach to CO2 regeneration from potassium carbonate and bicarbonate solutions. These solutions are meant to mimic typical “capture solutions” that result from the capture of CO2 gas into hydroxide solutions. The CO2 exists in solution as negatively charged carbonate (CO32−) or bicarbonate (HCO3−) anions. This solution is fed into a Bipolar Membrane Electrodialysis (BPMED) unit, which separates the carbonate/bicarbonate solution into an acid and a base by applying a voltage across an alternating stack of ion-selective anion-exchange membranes (AEMs) and water-dissociating bipolar membranes (BPMs), and transporting CO2 (viaCO32− or HCO3−transport) into the acidic solution. The acidic solution converts the transported CO32− or HCO3− into CO2 gas, and the low solubility of total dissolved CO2 in the acidic solution results in CO2 gas evolution.
The goal of this work was to measure and understand the performance of this system for various mixtures of KHCO3, K2CO3, and KOH. These measurements were intended to identify areas with the promise for a significant improvement of the system performance.
While some limited studies of CO2 gas recovery from aqueous solutions using electrodialysis have been performed in the past,11,30,31 the work presented in this paper represents the most detailed study of this process to date, including the investigation of a wide range of process and solution parameters.
Experimental methodology

Fig. 1 shows a schematic (panel a) and labeled photograph (panel b) of the experimental setup. At the center of the schematic is the BPMED unit, which is shown in Fig. 2 and described in more detail below.

As shown in Fig. 1b, the solution tanks are connected to the membrane stack via pumps (on the bottom of the pictured rack) and tubing, allowing us to flow separate solutions through the acid, base, and electrode compartments, respectively. We have outfitted the unit with an array of sensors that allow us to measure various experimental parameters. Using control software, we automatically record these measured parameters every 5 seconds, and save the data to a file for later analysis. We measure and record the following parameters: voltage and current (current is kept constant using the XHR40-25 programmable DC power supply from Xantrex Technology, Inc.); base and acid solution flow rate (model FP-5600, Omega Engineering, Inc.); the pressure at both the input and output to the base, acid, and electrode compartments (model PX219, Omega Engineering, Inc.); the flow rate of CO2 gas emitted from the acid compartment (we have sealed the acid compartment to be gas-tight to ensure that all gas generated in the acid compartment flows through the CO2 gas flow meter, model FMA1605A from Omega Engineering, Inc.); and the pH and conductivity of the acid and base solutions (pH: Thermo Scientific Orion 3-Star Plus with probe 9107BNMD; conductivity: Thermo Scientific Orion 3-Star Plus with probe 013005MD).

Fig. 2 shows the BPMED unit in more detail. The unit is a EUR2C-7-Bip (assembled in the two-compartment configuration) purchased from Ameridia Corp. consisting of seven cells in series, each cell containing an AEM (Neosepta AHA supplied by Ameridia Corp.) in series with a BPM (Neosepta BP-1E supplied by Ameridia Corp.). At each end of the stack of seven cells is a cation exchange membrane (CEM) (Neosepta C66-10F supplied by Ameridia Corp.) separating the cells from the electrode compartment. The spaces between adjacent membranes are filled with 762 µm thick polyethylene mesh spacers. Fig. 2b shows the configuration of the membrane stack. Each membrane has an area of 200 cm2, corresponding to a total AEM membrane area of 0.14 m2.
Procedure
In the experiments we describe below, the pH of the acid and base solutions is kept constant, resulting in steady-state behavior for measured quantities such as the rate of CO2 gas evolution from the acid compartment, voltage, and energy consumption. As shown in Fig. 1a, a solution of 0.3 M KH2PO4 and 15 mL of H3PO4 in 2.5 L de-ionized (DI) water is loaded into the acid tank. A solution of KHCO3, K2CO3, and KOH in 2.5 L DI water is loaded into the base tank—various concentrations of each of these solutes were used for different experimental runs. A solution of 2 M KOH in 2.5 L DI water is loaded into the electrode tank. All solutes were ACS reagent grade, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The pumps are turned on to allow volumetric flow rates of 300 L h−1 and 140 L h−1 in the electrode and acid/base tanks, respectively. Each solution flows from the tank, through the membrane stack, and then returns to the tank to be pumped again through the membrane stack. The solutions are allowed to flow for 5–10 minutes until the pH and conductivity values stabilize after mixing with the small amounts of water left behind in the setup. The gas headspace of the acid tank is flushed for 5 minutes with pure CO2 to ensure accurate readings. The power supply is then connected to the membrane stack electrodes and the control software is used to set a desired constant-current value. A voltage ceiling is also entered into the control software, and the power supply finds the required voltage less than or equal to the ceiling voltage that allows the desired current to be achieved. All experiments are run at a constant current.
Once the current starts to flow, ion transport begins and CO2 gas starts to flow from the acid compartment. As HCO3− and CO32− ions are transported into the acid compartment and CO2 gas is released, the pH of the acid compartment generally remains constant at about 2.5. However, after 5 hours of continuous operation, the pH of the acid solution will begin to rise. If this occurs, additional H3PO4 is added to the acid solution in order to keep the pH in the range 2.5–2.8. As HCO3− and CO32− ions are transported out of the base solution and replaced with OH− ions from the dissociation of water in the bipolar membranes, the pH of the base solution increases. In order to keep the base solution pH constant at its starting value for a given experiment, pure CO2 gas is bubbled directly into the base solution from a pressurized tank of CO2 gas. In this way, the acid and base solution pH values are kept constant for enough time during the experimental run to allow steady-state behavior to be achieved. In practice, during an experimental run, we continue the run until we have observed the pH, CO2 rate, and energy consumption per mol of CO2 to all have been constant for at least ten minutes.
At the beginning of each run, the rate of CO2 gas flowing from the acid compartment fluctuates as we tune the rate at which we bubble CO2 gas into the base solution in order to keep the pH constant. Once the CO2 bubbling rate has been properly tuned to match the CO2 transport rate out of the base solution, the rate of CO2 flow out of the acid compartment reaches a constant steady-state value. As discussed above, we continue the experiment until we observe that the pH, CO2 rate, and energy consumption have all been constant for ten minutes. The data measured during the last five minutes of the ten-minute steady-state period are used to calculate the steady-state average values plotted in Fig. 3–7. The base pH never deviated more than 0.05 units of pH from its mean value within this five-minute window. We have found this to be true of the base pH and acid pH for all experiments we performed.

Control experiments
Several control experiments were performed to verify that the gas bubbling out of the acid solution was indeed CO2. First, a control experiment was performed using 0.5 M KOH as the base solution to confirm that no gas flows from the acid compartment in this case. In addition, an experiment with 0.5 M K2CO3 base solution was performed in which the gas evolving from the acid compartment was sampled and analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard 5890 Series II). This experiment confirmed that the gas sampled from the acid compartment was indeed CO2.
Results and discussion
Constant-current experiments were performed under steady state conditions to explore the effect of varying the base-solution pH/ionic species concentrations. Experiments were performed for six different base solutions, each at seven different values of constant current (1 A, 2 A, 4 A, 8 A, 12 A, 16 A, and 20 A). An experiment was not performed at 20 A for KHCO3 because the low rate of CO2 capture in the base solution at this low pH combined with the high rate of CO2 transport out of the base solution into the acid solution meant that we were not able to keep the base pH constant and achieve steady-state behavior for these conditions. All experiments were performed with an acid-solution pH in the range 2.51–2.83.
Rate of CO2 concentration

Effect of base pH. 

Fig. 3a shows the measured rate of CO2 gas emitted from the acid tank as a function of current for the six different base solutions studied. The color of the data points represents the pH of the base solution. For a fixed current value, the KHCO3 solution results in a CO2 rate that is about twice as large as K2CO3 solution for the same value of current. This behavior is expected, since CO2 transport for KHCO3 solution viaHCO3− requires half the charge per CO2 as CO2 transport for K2CO3 solution viaCO32−. The CO2 rate for mixtures of KHCO3 and K2CO3 for a given current fall between the values for pure KHCO3 and pure K2CO3. The CO2 rates at a given current for K2CO3/KOH mixtures are much lower than for solutions without any KOH because the presence of a significant concentration of KOH allows a significant fraction of the current to be carried viaOH− ions.


Effect of base concentration. 

Fig. 3b shows the measured rate of CO2 gas emitted from the acid tank versus current for three concentrations of K2CO3 base solution: 0.125 M, 0.5 M, and 2 M. Color represents the pH of the base solution. Fig. 3b shows that the maximum CO2 generation rate for a given current occurs for 0.5 M K2CO3. From Fig. 4b (discussed in the next section), we see that the maximum CO2 rate occurs at 0.5 M because the efficiency is also maximized for 0.5 M. Since the efficiency is simply defined as the number of CO2 molecules transported per charge transported, then for a given value of current density, the CO2 rate and the efficiency will be maximized for the same value of concentration. The reason that the maximum in efficiency occurs at a concentration of 0.5 M is explained in the next section.

Efficiency

Effect of base pH. 
To determine the efficiency with which charge transport results in CO2 transport, we define efficiency as the measured number of CO2 molecules transported per charge transported, divided by the ideal case for KHCO3 of one CO2 molecule per electron charge. Defined in this way, the ideal efficiency for a solution of KHCO3 (where all the charge would be carried by HCO3− ions) is 1, while the ideal efficiency for a solution of K2CO3 (where all the charge would be carried by CO32− ions) is 0.5. Transport of non-CO2 transporting ions such as OH− ions will reduce the efficiency from these ideal values. Fig. 4a shows the efficiency as a function of current for the six different base solutions studied. The color of the data points represents the pH of the base solution. The efficiency is seen to approach the ideal values of 1.0 (0.5) for KHCO3 (K2CO3) for currents greater than 8 A. The efficiencies for solutions containing KOH are seen to be very low because the transport of OH− (which does not transport any CO2) is a significant contribution to the total current.
The energy consumed per mol of CO2 can be thought of as having two contributions: (1) Which ion is transporting CO2? and (2) Given that CO2 is transported by a certain ion, over what voltage must this ion be transported? The efficiency shown in Fig. 4a gives us a measure of which ions are being transported. For example, in the case of KHCO3 for currents greater than 8 A where the efficiency is very close to one, we know that almost all the CO2 transport must be performed by the singly charged HCO3−.
We observe in Fig. 4a that as a function of current, the efficiencies increase from low starting values at 1 A (0.3 for K2CO3 and 0.6 for KHCO3, each about 60% of their respective theoretical maxima), and asymptotically approach fairly constant values of efficiency at high currents. The efficiencies at high currents are quite close to the theoretical maxima for the various solutions: about 0.95 for KHCO3 and about 0.45 for K2CO3, with values in between for the mixtures of KHCO3 and K2CO3.
Much of the behavior shown in Fig. 4a can be understood in terms of the acid/alkaline membrane-state model developed by Jörissen and Simmrock.32,33 In this model, depending on the relative concentrations of H+ and OH− ions in the acidic and basic solutions on either side of the AEM, the membrane is either in an “acidic state” or “alkaline state”. In the case where the H+ concentration in the acid solution dominates the OH− concentration in the base solution, the membrane is in the acidic state throughout its entire thickness, and an acidic boundary layer develops on the side of the membrane adjacent to the base solution. Conversely, when the OH− ion concentration in the base solution dominates the H+ concentration in the acid solution, the membrane is in the alkaline state throughout its entire thickness, and an alkaline boundary layer develops on the side of the membrane adjacent to the acid solution.
First we consider the four curves in Fig. 4a that contain no KOH. The acid solution for all experiments shown in Fig. 4 had a pH of around 2.5, corresponding to an H+ concentration of about 3 × 10−3 M. The OH− concentration in the base solution ranged from about 4.5 × 10−3 M for the (pH = 11.66) 0.5 M K2CO3 solution to 4.5 × 10−6 M for the (pH = 8.66) 0.5 M KHCO3 solution. This means that the AEMs are likely in the acidic state for the experiments with KHCO3, and mixtures of KHCO3/K2CO3, and just on the dividing line between acidic and alkaline for the experiments with pure K2CO3. The rapid increase in efficiency at the current is increased from 1 A to 8 A is likely due to co-ion leakage of H+ ions through the AEMs. This suggests that indeed the AEMs are in the acidic state for the experiments with 0.5 M KHCO3, mixtures of KHCO3 and K2CO3, and 0.5 M K2CO3, because if the AEMs were in the alkaline state, the alkaline boundary layer on the acidic side of the AEM would neutralize any H+ ions before they could leak through the AEM.32,33 The effect of H+ leakage decreases with increasing current, becoming effectively negligible at currents above 8 A. At low currents, the maximum possible current due to H+ co-ion leakage can be a significant fraction of the total current, but as the total current increases beyond the maximum possible H+ co-ion current, the H+ current becomes a negligible fraction of the total current.
We have performed tests to verify that the decreased efficiency at low current values is due to H+ co-ion transport through the AEMs, rather than some other mechanism such as K+ co-ion transport. To test for H+ transport, we measured the efficiency versus current for four different acid solutions with varying pH values. Each of these solutions had a K+ concentration of 0.3 M, but the pH of the solutions was varied by adding different amounts of KH2PO4, K2HPO4, and H3PO4, producing solutions with pH values of 2.7, 3.6, 5.0, and 6.1. The base solution in all cases was 0.5 M KHCO3. At low current values we observe much lower efficiency for the low-pH solutions (0.4 for an acid pH of 2.7 compared to 0.6 for an acid solution with pH of 6.1), while the efficiency of all solutions approaches the same asymptotic value of about 0.9 at high current values. This demonstrates the importance of H+ co-ion transport in decreasing the efficiency at low current values. To test whether K+ co-ion transport also affects efficiency, we measured the efficiency versus current for three different acid solutions with varying K+ concentrations. Each had a pH of 5.7, but the K+ concentration of the solutions was varied by adding different amounts of K2HPO4 and KH2PO4, producing solutions with K+ concentrations of 0.1 M, 0.5 M, and 0.9 M. The base solution in all cases was 0.5 M KHCO3. The efficiency appears to increase only slightly with increasing K+ concentration at low current values, suggesting that K+ co-ion transport does not significantly contribute to the observed decrease in current efficiency at low current values. From these tests, we conclude that H+ co-ion transport through the AEMs is the primary cause of low efficiencies at low current values.
The asymptotic value of efficiency achieved at currents above 10 A increases from about 0.5 for 0.5 M K2CO3 to about 1.0 for KHCO3, with values in between for mixtures of KHCO3 and K2CO3. This is simply due to the fact that CO32−transports one CO2 molecule for every two charges transported, whereas HCO3−transports one CO2 molecule for every one charge transported. For these four curves, the maximum pH (for the case of 0.5 M K2CO3) is only 11.55, corresponding to an OH− concentration of 3.5 × 10−3 M. Therefore for these four solutions of KHCO3 and K2CO3, the effect on efficiency due to OH−transport competing with HCO3− and CO32−transport is negligible.
However, for the two curves in Fig. 4a that do contain KOH, the ratio of OH− concentration to CO32− concentration is close to one, and the OH−transport carries a significant fraction of the total current. This results in the very low efficiencies observed for these solutions.
From Fig. 4a, we also see that for the two solutions containing KOH, there is no sharp decrease in efficiency at low current values as seen for the other four solutions. This can be understood using the acid/alkaline membrane-state model of Jörissen and Simmrock.32,33 For the 0.5 M K2CO3/0.1 M KOH (0.5 M K2CO3/0.5 M KOH) solution, the pH is 13.2 (13.5), corresponding to an OH− concentration of 0.16 M (0.3 M), much larger than the H+ concentration in the (pH = 2.5) acid solution of 3 × 10−3 M. Therefore, the AEMs were likely in the alkaline state for these experiments. According to the model, this means there should be an alkaline boundary layer on the side of the anion-exchange membrane adjacent to the acid solution. In this case, H+ co-ion transport through the AEM does not occur because any H+ is neutralized by the alkaline boundary layer before entering the AEM.
We also observe that a maximum of efficiency with respect to current appears to occur for both KHCO3 and K2CO3 at around 10 A for KHCO3 and 8 A for K2CO3. These maxima are approximately 1.0 (0.5) for KHCO3 (K2CO3), indicating that at these current values all ion transport across the anion exchange membranes is carried by HCO3− and CO32− ions, for the KHCO3 and K2CO3 solutions, respectively.
For all six solutions shown in Fig. 4, we observe that as the current is increased past some optimum value (around 8 A), the efficiency decreases slightly with increasing current density. There are two likely explanations for this effect, both of which probably contribute to the observed behavior: (1) loss of permselectivity of the BPMs at high current densities due to the required high rate of water transfer through the AEM and CEM layers of the BPM,34 and (2) increased water splitting in the AEMs with increasing current density, auto-catalyzed by the functional groups in the membrane.35–37


Effect of base concentration. 

Fig. 4b shows the efficiency versus current for three concentrations of K2CO3 base solution: 0.125 M, 0.5 M, and 2 M. Color represents the pH of the base solution. This plot shows that there is an optimum concentration of around 0.5 M K2CO3 that allows an efficiency close to the maximum for K2CO3 of 0.5.
The pH values of the (0.125 M, 0.5 M, and 2 M) K2CO3 solutions shown in Fig. 5b were (11.55, 11.55, and 12.4), corresponding to OH− concentrations of (3.5 × 10−3 M, 3.5 × 10−3 M, and 2.5 × 10−2 M). The CO32− concentrations of (0.125 M, 0.5 M, 2 M) for these solutions correspond to concentration ratios of CO32− to OH− of (63, 250, and 80). From Fig. 4b, we see that the efficiency at high current values can be qualitatively related to the ratio of CO32− to OH− ions—the efficiency is close to the theoretical maximum of 0.5 for 0.5 M K2CO3 (CO32− to OH− ratio of 250), decreases to 0.4–0.45 for 2 M (CO32− to OH− ratio of 80), and decreases further for 0.125 M (CO32− to OH− ratio of 63). The actual fraction of current carried by CO32− compared to that carried by OH− as a function of their concentration ratio in the base solution will depend on many factors, including their relative transport numbers in the specific AEM used in our system.

As was described above in the discussion of Fig. 4a, the sharp decrease in current efficiency at low current values seen in Fig. 4b is due to the large fractional contribution of H+ co-ion transport to the total current.

Voltage

Effect of base pH. 

Fig. 5a shows the other contribution to the energy consumption—the measured voltage drop over the entire electrodialysis unit. As expected, due to resistive losses (for example in the electrodes, in each membrane, in the base and acid solutions, etc.) the voltage increases with current for all six base solutions studied. We also see that the slope of the voltage versus current is different for each of the six base solutions studied, implying that each of these solutions has a different effective resistance to current flow. While some of this difference is certainly due to the different behavior of the different transport ions, some of this effect may be due to the different amount of CO2 gas bubbles in the stack due to different rates of CO2 evolution for each of the six base solutions. For example, at a given current, we have seen from Fig. 3a that the CO2 generation rate differs for the various base solutions. For a given current, KHCO3 yields the highest rate (the transport of only one charge is required to transport each CO2 molecule, compared to two charges per CO2 molecule for K2CO3), while the solutions with KOH yield the lowest rate because a significant fraction of the current is carried by non-CO2 transporting OH− ions. This likely results in a greater number of gas bubbles trapped in the membrane stack for solutions that yield higher CO2 rates at a given current. The greater number of gas bubbles results in a higher resistance by reducing the effective area of the membranes, resulting in a larger voltage for a given current. This is exactly what we observe in Fig. 5a. The order of solutions from highest voltage (0.5 M KHCO3) to lowest voltage (0.5 M K2CO3/0.5 M KOH) is the same as the order of solutions in Fig. 3a from highest to lowest CO2 generation rate at a given current.
Recent experiments in our lab have demonstrated (to our knowledge for the first time) electrodialysis at elevated pressures as high as 10 atm. By pressurizing the membrane stack to 10 atm, the CO2 is kept in solution until the pressure is released downstream of the membrane stack in the acid solution tank. This eliminates the increased resistance due to the bubbles in the membrane stack, thus decreasing the voltage and energy for a given current density. At large current densities (139 mA cm−2), we have observed a 30% reduction in the energy per mol of CO2 at 10 atm relative to the energy required at 1.5 atm. These results will be presented in greater detail in a forthcoming article.


Effect of base concentration. 

Fig. 5b shows voltage versus current for three concentrations of K2CO3 base solution (0.125 M, 0.5 M, and 2 M). This plot shows that within the concentration range studied, at a fixed current the voltage decreases monotonically with increasing K2CO3 concentration. This effect is primarily due to the increasing conductivity of the base solution with increasing K2CO3 concentration. In our seven-cell membrane stack, the space between the membranes through which the acid and base solutions flow is each 762 µm thick. The geometry of the membrane stack means that there are seven spaces through which acid solution flows, and eight through which base solution flows (see Fig. 2b). Using the distance between the membranes (762 µm), the 200 cm2 active area of the membranes, the acid and base solution conductivity data, and the applied current, we have calculated the voltage attributable only to the seven acid-solution spaces and eight base-solution spaces between the membranes. The conductivity of the acid solution was measured to be the same for all three experiments testing different base solution concentrations (0.125 M, 0.5 M, and 2 M K2CO3), with an average value of about 20 mS cm−1. The average conductivity of the base solution for a K2CO3 concentration of (0.125 M, 0.5 M, 2 M) was measured to be about (27 mS cm−1, 78 mS cm−1, and 203 mS cm−1). For different K2CO3 concentrations, we compared the difference in voltage attributable only to the varying base-solution conductivity to the difference in total voltage, and calculated the fraction of total voltage difference that is attributable to the changing base conductivity. We observe that for each of the three possible comparisons (0.125 M to 0.5 M, 0.125 M to 2 M, and 0.5 M to 2 M) about 50–80% of the total voltage difference is attributable to the difference in base conductivity. The remainder of the observed differences in total voltage for the three solutions is likely due the different conductivity values within the anion-exchange membranes due to the different CO32− concentrations, and different ratios of CO32− to OH− in the three solutions.

Energy consumption

Effect of base pH. 
The energy expended per mol of CO2 generated is calculated by dividing the energy per second (voltage times current) by the moles of CO2 generated per second. Fig. 6a shows the energy per mol of CO2 generated from the acid solution as a function of current for four of the six base solutions studied (those that are mixtures of K2CO3 and KHCO3). Results for all six solutions studied, including those containing KOH, are shown in Table 1. We observe a minimum of energy occurring not at the minimum current of 1 A, but rather at 2 A, for all six base solutions studied. This behavior results from a tradeoff between efficiency and voltage: the poor efficiency at very low currents (see Fig. 4) tends to increase the energy consumption as the current decreases, while the large resistive losses at high currents (see Fig. 5) tends to increase the energy consumption as the current increases.

Table 1 Measured energy consumption (in kJ mol−1CO2) for various base solutions. “Total” = energy consumption across entire seven-cell stack, including electrodes; “zero cell” = energy consumed by a system with zero cells (i.e. a system with just end electrodes and two cation exchange membranes); “corrected” = total energy minus zero-cell energy. There is no data for KHCO3 at 20 A because the slow reaction rate of CO2 gas in KHCO3 and the high rate of HCO3−transport out of the base solution prevented steady-state behavior from being achieved. Data for 0.5 M K2CO3 and 0.5 M KHCO3 are plotted in Fig. 7.

Effect of base concentration. 
The efficiency and voltage dependence on concentration combine to give the energy dependence shown in Fig. 6b. Here we see that the higher efficiency observed for 0.5 M K2CO3 compared to 2 M K2CO3 outweighs the slightly higher voltages required for 0.5 M relative to 2 M, resulting in a minimum of energy consumption occurring for 0.5 M K2CO3.
These measurements have important implications for the practical design of CO2 capture units. The data in Fig. 6 and Table 1 demonstrate that in order to minimize the energy of regeneration, the capture unit should be designed to produce an approximately 0.5 M KHCO3 solution as output. However, the rate of CO2 capture decreases substantially as the pH of the capture solution decreases, and catalysed capture will likely be necessary for capture at these pH values.38 As a result, in the design of a CO2 separation system including a CO2 capture unit and CO2 regeneration unit, there will be a tradeoff between the energy of regeneration and the rate of CO2 capture, which itself can affect the energy of the capture process. The data presented here can be used to inform decisions in the design process related to these tradeoffs.


Contribution of end electrodes. 
The energies shown in Fig. 6a were calculated using the voltage values shown in Fig. 5a, which correspond to the total voltage across the entire electrodialysis unit, including the contribution from the electrodes.
From Fig. 2, we see that each end electrode is adjacent to a CEM, with a 2 M KOH electrode solution flowing between each electrode and the adjacent CEM. In between these end compartments is stack of seven “cells”, each cell comprised of an adjacent series of: base solution, bipolar membrane, acid solution, and anion exchange membrane. While our lab-scale electrodialysis unit only has seven cells between end electrode compartments, a commercial unit typically has over 100. For such a commercial unit, the fraction of the total voltage drop (and energy consumed) that occurs at the end electrode compartment is negligible (<1%) since it scales as the inverse of the number of cells (>100). For our seven-cell lab unit, the fractional voltage drop and energy consumed at the end electrode compartments are not negligible. However, by making the measurements described below, we can determine the contribution to the total voltage and energy from the end electrode compartments, and the contribution from the cells themselves. Subtracting the contribution of the end electrode compartments from the total voltage in order to determine the voltage drop and energy consumption of the cells alone tells us what the voltage drop and energy consumption would be if we scaled our system to commercial size (>100 cells).
Experiments were performed for two different base solutions: 0.5 M KHCO3 and 0.5 M K2CO3. The experimental setup and steady-state experimental procedure employed were identical to that described in previous sections. This series of experiments were repeated for an electrodialysis unit containing seven, six, five, and four cells. Altering the unit from seven cells to six cells, for example, was accomplished by opening up the unit and removing one BPM, one AEM, and their adjacent spacers and gaskets. We cannot directly measure the voltage for fewer than four cells because of the geometry of the electrodialysis unit. For each current, a linear fit is performed to the voltages measured for seven, six, five, and four cells in order to extrapolate to the zero-cell case. The extrapolated zero-cell voltage corresponds to the voltage contribution from the end electrode compartments (end electrodes and adjacent CEMs).

Table 1 and Fig. 7 compare the “corrected” energy calculated by subtracting off the energy consumption of the end electrodes with the total energy consumption calculated by including the electrode contribution. From Fig. 7 we see that the minimum energy (for the low-current limit of KHCO3) consumed per mol of CO2 in a commercial-scale unit (where the electrode contribution to the voltage and energy can be ignored) is about 100 kJ mol−1CO2.

Relevance to CO2 separation and liquid-fuel synthesis. 
Separating CO2 from a dilute source like the atmosphere typically involves two steps: capture and regeneration. We have demonstrated the possibility for CO2 regeneration from KHCO3 solutions for 100 kJ mol−1CO2. The energy required to capture CO2 from the atmosphere into a hydroxide solution has been measured to be about 200 kJ mol−1CO2, although lower energies are expected in full-scale systems.20 This implies that using BPMED for regeneration, CO2 can be separated from the atmosphere for a total energy cost of about 300 kJ mol−1CO2. To put this number into context, the thermodynamic minimum energy for separating CO2 from the atmosphere (at a concentration of 386 ppm) is about 20 kJ mol−1 (CO2); the energy for amine-based separation of CO2 from power-plant flue gas (typically about 10% CO2) is expected to be 45–65 kJ mol−1 (CO2) (not including the energy to pressurize CO2 in preparation for sequestration), with improved configurations possibly reducing this energy to less than 30 kJ mol−1 (CO2).39,40
A promising use of CO2 captured directly from the air is to react it with renewably produced H2 to synthesize carbon-neutral liquid hydrocarbon fuels.7–9 To put the energy consumption in the context of liquid fuel synthesis, 300 kJ mol−1CO2 corresponds to 47% of the methanol lower heating value (LHV) of 638.1 kJ mol−1 (CH3OH). If we assume a 40% overall conversion efficiency to go from the primary energy source (for example, solar or wind) to methanol, 300 kJ mol−1CO2 corresponds to 19% of the total input energy required (assuming a one-to-one molar correspondence between methanol and CO2: 3H2 + CO2 → CH3OH + H2O).
Finally, we note that the regeneration of CO2 using BPMED is not limited to bicarbonate/carbonate capture solutions, but can also be applied to more conventional capture solvents such as monoethanolamine.31

Conclusions
Caustic solvents such as sodium or potassium hydroxides, converted viaCO2 capture to aqueous carbonates or bicarbonates, are a likely candidate for atmospheric CO2 separation.20,24 We have experimentally investigated an electrochemical approach to CO2 gas regeneration from potassium carbonate and bicarbonate solutions. The CO2 exists in solution as CO32− or HCO3− ions. This solution is fed into a Bipolar Membrane Electrodialysis (BPMED) unit, which separates the carbonate/bicarbonate solution into an acid and a base by applying a voltage across an alternating stack of ion-selective AEMs and water-dissociating BPMs, and transporting CO2 (viaCO32− or HCO3−transport) into the acidic solution. The acidic solution converts the transported CO32− or HCO3− into CO2 gas, and the low solubility of total dissolved CO2 in the acidic solution results in CO2 gas evolution.
We have characterized the performance of this system on six different mixtures of KHCO3, K2CO3, and KOH by measuring the CO2 gas generation rate, efficiency, voltage, and energy consumption for a wide range of constant-current values. Our results indicate that the energy consumption required to separate CO2 gas from aqueous bicarbonate (carbonate) solutions using this method can be as low as 100 kJ (200 kJ) per mol of CO2 in the small-current-density limit.
Separating CO2 from a dilute source like the atmosphere typically involves two steps: capture and regeneration. Our measured minimum energy of 100 kJ mol−1CO2 for CO2 regeneration using BPMED, and the previously measured value of 200 kJ mol−1CO2 for the capture of CO2 into hydroxide solutions,20 suggests that CO2 can be separated from the atmosphere for a total energy cost of about 300 kJ mol−1CO2. To put the measured energy consumption in the context of liquid fuel synthesis, 300 kJ mol−1CO2 corresponds to 19% of the total input energy required to synthesize methanol, assuming an overall conversion efficiency to go from energy to methanol of 40%, and a one-to-one molar correspondence of CO2 to methanol.

Broader context
Although the transportation sector accounts for over thirty percent of all CO2 emitted in the United States, the weight of CO2 created upon combustion makes onboard capture and storage of these emissions impractical. As a result, the ability to capture CO2 directly from the atmosphere will be required in order to control CO2 emissions from “mobile emitters” such as cars, buses, and planes. Aqueous hydroxides, converted viaCO2 capture to aqueous carbonates or bicarbonates, are likely capture-solvent candidates for atmospheric CO2 separation. We present a comprehensive experimental investigation of CO2 gas regeneration from potassium carbonate and bicarbonate solutions using bipolar membrane electrodialysis. This system allows the regeneration of pure CO2 gas, suitable for subsequent sequestration or use, from aqueous capture solutions. We demonstrate that this system can be quite efficient, with an energy consumption as low as 100 kJ per mol of CO2 from bicarbonate solutions. This approach represents an alternative to conventional regeneration approaches such as steam stripping, and is applicable to other capture solvents such as MEA.
