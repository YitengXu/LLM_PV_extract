    , Accepted 10th August 2015First published on 19th August 2015AbstractA two-storey structured photoanode of a 3D Cu2ZnSnS4(CZTS)/CdS/ZnO@steel composite nanostructure has been fabricated by using the solution method and demonstrated highly efficient photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation due to its contraption in the structure for sufficient light absorption as well as the three step-down band alignments for efficient charge separation and transport. This composite structure is composed of two storeys: the upper storey is the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-nanorods (NRs) covered on the stainless steel mesh; the bottom storey is the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs grown on the FTO glass. The CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs have cascade band gaps decreasing from 3.15 to 1.82 eV, which gives them efficient charge transfer and broad photoresponse in the UV to near-IR region, resulting in 47% IPCE in a wide light region from 400 to 500 nm; and the stainless steel mesh serves not only as a conductor for charge transport, but also as a skeleton of the grid structure for absorbing more light. The related mechanism has been investigated, which demonstrates that the two-storey CZTS/CdS/ZnO@steel composite nanostructure would have great potential as a promising photoelectrode with high efficiency and low cost for PEC hydrogen generation.
1. Introduction
Due to the urgent demand for eco-friendly fuel and energy, hydrogen production by photoelectrochemical (PEC) reaction has become a hot topic in recent years. The PEC hydrogen generation should be performed using sunlight, or other electromagnetic radiation shining onto the photoelectrode in the PEC cell. The photoelectrode plays an irreplaceable role in the energy conversion from optical to electrical, and finally to chemical energy. The crucial conditions for highly efficient energy conversion include light absorption, charge separation and transport, as well as the chemical reactions on the surface.1–5 All the conditions can be optimized by choosing unique materials and improving morphologies of the photoelectrodes. From the material point of view, various absorbing semiconductors with suitable band gap energies (1.3–2.0 eV),6–8 such as BiVO4,9 CdS,10 CdSe,11 CdTe,12etc., have been widely investigated. Among them, Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) has received considerable attention as a light sensitizer for PEC hydrogen generation due to its near-optimal direct band gap (1.4–1.8 eV) and high absorption coefficient (∼104 cm−1). Up to now, various CZTS nanostructures have been reported. W. Wang fabricated the Cu2ZnSnS4-based thin-film solar cells having a solar energy conversion efficiency of ∼12.6%.13 M. S. Prévot reported that the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (ηSTH) of a tandem-structural CZTS PEC cell reached ∼15%.14 S. Ahmed prepared the CZTS smooth nanolayer on an ITO glass, which achieved a power conversion efficiency of 7.3%.15 Besides these important properties of CZTS as a photoelectrode, earth-abundance and low-toxicity also give the CZTS nanostructures great advantages in the PEC research field. However, the study of aforementioned CZTS nanostructures still has a problem awaiting solution from the morphology's point of view. For example, most of the reported CZTS photoelectrodes have thin films or two-dimensional (2D) structures, so their lower surface areas limit the light absorption capability necessarily. Therefore, the design of photoelectrodes with a higher surface area while keeping excellent electron transportation and a strong light-scattering ability at the same time is highly desirable. S. C. Riha16 and Q. J. Guo17 independently prepared high quality CZTS nanocrystals with a large surface area owing to the small crystal sizes of about 10–12 nm. A. Singh reported CZTS nanorods having 10 nm diameter.18 Because these nanoparticles were homogeneously synthesized and dispersed in solution, their direct applications in photoelectrodes have limitations. An effective way is to use a nano-sized material as a sensitizer to increase the visible light harvesting and thus improve the conversion efficiency, such as the decoration of the photosensitive nanomaterials on the ZnO flakes,19 ZnO nanorods,20,21 or other 1D nanostructures.22–24 These structures not only increase the surface area but also enable efficient charge transport and separation of photogenerated carriers. However, compared to these common and moderate 1D nanostructures, a composite 3D structure is desirable because it will further enhance PEC efficiency due to its high specific surface area and porosity, direct charge transportation paths as well as light trapping by multi-scattering of light.25–27
Herein, we report the fabrication of a 3D CZTS/CdS/ZnO@steel composite nanostructure by using hydrothermal and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) methods. This ingenious structure contains two storeys: the bottom storey is the vertically aligned CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-nanorod arrays grown on the FTO glass; the upper storey is the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-nanorod arrays grown uniformly on the surface of a stainless steel grid, which is abbreviated as the grid of the CZTS/CdS/ZnO@steel composite nanostructure. The CZTS/CdS/ZnO NWs have a type II cascade band alignment, which was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) combined with light absorption spectroscopy. This ideal band alignment is efficient for both charge transfer and separation. An enhanced PEC performance can be obtained due to the larger surface area of 3D double storey structures for quantum dot loading and improved light scattering, as well as the advantage in facilitating electrolyte infiltration and promoting electron transportation in comparison with that of either a 2D or 1D composite structure.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 98%), ammonium hydroxide (28 wt% NH3 in water, 99.99%), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4, 99%), sodium sulfide (Na2S, 98%), copper iodide (CuI, 99.999%), zinc acetate (Zn(OAc)2, 99.99%), tin chloride(II) (SnCl2, 98%) and thiourea (CH4N2S, 99%) were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. Absolute methanol (CH4OH, 99.8%) was obtained from Fisher and used as received. Stainless steel mesh substrates were supplied by a general store. The water used in the experiment was purified using a three-stage Millipore Milli-Q Plus system and had a resistivity higher than 18.2 MΩ cm. Prior to material deposition, the F-doped tin oxide (TEC, 8 Ω sq.−1) and mesh substrates were sequentially ultrasonically cleaned for 10 min with detergent, ethanol and DI water.
2.2. Preparation of CZTS/CdS/ZnO nanowire arrays
Well-aligned ZnO nanowire (NW) arrays were grown on FTO and a mesh substrate using the ammonia solution hydrothermal method. First, a 50 nm ZnO seed layer was sputtered on the front side of the FTO substrate and on the front and back sides of the mesh substrate. The substrate was immersed in a 10 mM zinc ion solution prepared by dissolving Zn(NO3)2·6H2O in deionized water and 3.8 mL of ammonium hydroxide (28–30 wt%) and stored in an oven at 95 °C overnight. After the growth step, the substrate was washed with deionized water and gently dried using N2. The ZnO nanowires were modified by CdS deposition using successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR).28,29 Briefly, the CdS was deposited with a 200 mM CdSO4 solution and a 200 mM Na2S aqueous solution with 20 repeated cycles. Next, a CZTS absorber layer was coated on a CdS/ZnO NW array. CuI, Zn(OAc)2, SnCl2, and thiourea were mixed in methanol. The Cu:Zn:Sn:S ratio was set at 1.8:1.2:1:20 to develop a copper-poor, zinc-rich phase and to compensate for sulfur loss during annealing. The transparent and colorless precursor solution was spin-coated onto the CdS/ZnO NW samples at 1300 rpm for 30 s. (In the case of the mesh substrate, the mesh was attached to glass to allow the use of the vacuum chuck of the spin-coater.) The sample was then placed on a 150 °C preheated hot plate for 10 min, immediately transferred to a 250 °C preheated hot plate and maintained at this temperature for 10 min. After heat treatment, the samples were allowed to cool to room temperature in an air environment.
2.3. Characterization
The surface morphology of the samples was characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, XL30S, Philips), and the detailed microscopy structure was observed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, Cs-corrected HR-STEM, JEOL JEM-2200FS with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) elemental mapping). The optical absorbance of the sample was analyzed using a UV2501PC (Shimadzu) spectrometer with an ISR-2200 integrating sphere attachment for the diffuse reflection measurement. The chemical composition and binding states of the samples were analyzed by using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, ESCALAB 220i-XL, Thermo VG) using monochromatic Mg Kα radiation as the X-ray source. The phase and the crystallinity of the samples were determined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Max-2500 V, Rigaku). UPS measurements were performed using a Kratos Axis Nova instrument. He I (hν = 21.22 eV) was used as a light source, and sputtered Au substrates were used as a reference. The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed using a typical three-electrode potentiostat system (potentiostat/galvanostat, model 263A, EG&G Princeton Applied Research) with a Pt counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE). The electrolyte was a 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous solution (pH ∼ 12.5) through which nitrogen was bubbled. The working electrode was illuminated from the front side with a solar-simulated light source (AM 1.5 G filtered, 100 mW cm−2, 91160, Oriel). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength was measured using a photomodulation spectroscopic setup (model Merlin, Oriel).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterization
Schematic for the two-storey Cu2ZnSnS4(CZTS)/CdS/ZnO@steel composite nanostructure is shown in Fig. 1a. This structure is composed of upper and bottom storeys: the upper storey is the stainless steel mesh covered by the uniformly distributed CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-nanorods (NRs); the bottom storey is the vertically aligned CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs grown on the FTO glass. The CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NR comprised ZnO nanrods, CdS and CZTS layers from the core to the outer shell (Fig. 1b). It can be seen that the incident light can percolate through the upper mesh hole partially and then shine onto the bottom storey. From Fig. 1c, we can see that the incident light could shine on the upper storey directly and has a little reflection along the paths 1 and 3; or pass through the upper storey and then shine onto the bottom storey along path 2. Although the light reflected and scattered from the bottom storey is less, they can be re-absorbed by the upper storey. Due to the mesh grid structure of the upper storey and the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs covered on the whole structure, an overwhelming majority of the incident light can be absorbed. That is the important characteristic of this unique photoanode structure in the current study. Fig. 1d presents the morphology of the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs grown on the surface of the stainless steel mesh. The diameter of the steel wire is approximately 100 μm, and the distance between the neighboring wires is about 150 μm. The mesh holes of 150 μm × 150 μm can not only provide the light path, but also facilitate the electrolyte diffusing through the openings to exchange electrons with the electrodes. The surface of the steel wire is covered by the uniformly deposited CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs (Fig. 1e), which have almost the same length about 15 μm (Fig. 1f).

CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs are crucial components of the two-storey composite structure. The fabrication procedure of CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs consists of three steps, which are exhibited in Fig. 2. Firstly, the ZnO NRs having a length of 15 μm and diameters of 80–100 nm were prepared by hydrothermal growth on the cleaned FTO glass substrate (Fig. 2a). Next, the CdS layer was deposited onto the surface of the ZnO NRs by using successive ionic layer absorption and reaction (SILAR) (Fig. 2b). SILAR offers uniform CdS loading with lower aggregation. The TEM images of the ZnO/CdS core/shell nanorods are provided in the ESI.† Finally, CZTS was deposited by spin-coating a methanol-based molecular precursor solution onto the ZnO/CdS hetero-NRs (Fig. 2c). Before deposition, the metal precursors (Cu, Zn and Sn) and chalcogen precursors (S) should be dissolved in methanol.

ZnO, CdS and CZTS are colored by green, yellow and magenta, respectively. The insets of the SEM images in the upper right corner are the enlarged views. 
To elucidate the crystal structure of the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were performed, respectively. Fig. 3a clearly shows that the CdS and CZTS layers uniformly cover the ZnO NRs from the inner to outer shell. The average shell thicknesses of the CdS and CZTS were approximately 10 and 20 nm, respectively. A high-resolution TEM image exhibited in Fig. 3b demonstrates that a lattice spacing of 0.26 nm corresponds to the (001) plane of ZnO (JCPDS 792205) in the core of the hetero-NRs; outside the ZnO, a lattice spacing of 0.33 nm matches the (111) plane of CdS (JCPDS-800019);30 for the outermost layer, the CZTS was measured to be 0.31 nm for the (112) plane (JCPDS-260575).31 Spatial elemental analysis using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was also performed and is shown in Fig. 3c–h. The results confirmed that the Cu, Zn, Sn and S elements were uniformly distributed in their respective layers.

The interfaces between the ZnO, CdS, CZTS and outside are marked by green, yellow and red dotted-lines, respectively. The insets on the right are the close-up view of regions 1 and 2, which show the crystal lattices of CZTS (112) and CdS (111), respectively; (c–h) EELS elemental mappings of Cu, Zn, Sn, S, Cd, and O, respectively. 

Fig. 4a presents the XRD patterns of the CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs and CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs in the upper and middle rows, respectively. For the CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs, ZnO exhibits a wurtzite structure with a strong orientation along the c-axis due to its major (001) peak at 34.4°; the as-deposited CdS has a wide peak centered at 26.4°, which corresponds to its (111) plane. With the deposition of the CZTS layer on the surface of CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs, the (112) planes of CZTS are present at the peak of 28.3° (middle row of Fig. 4a). It can be seen that the (111) peak of CdS is positioned very close to the (112) peak of CZTS, and both of them have broad peak features, thus, the overlapped peaks are deconvoluted and presented as a red color for CZTS and a yellow color for CdS in the inset of the middle row in Fig. 4a. To confirm the XRD results of CZTS alone, a CZTS film spin-coated onto a Si substrate was analyzed by XRD measurements. The results show that the diffraction peaks at 28.3°, 46.8°, and 55.3° are found, which are attributed to the (112), (220) and (312) planes of the CZTS phase, respectively, providing strong evidence of the single-crystal compound CZTS. To study chemical binding states of all four elements in the compound CZTS in our samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed and the results are shown in Fig. 4b. The copper 2p peaks located at 931.92 and 951.78 eV, with a peak splitting of 19.86 eV, indicate that copper is in the +1 oxidation state as Cu(I). The two zinc 2p peaks positioned at 1044.81 and 1021.83 eV, with a peak separation of 22.98 eV, suggest the presence of Zn(II). The Sn 3d peaks located at 486.30 and 494.73 eV indicate Sn(IV) with a peak splitting of 8.43 eV. The sulfur 2p peaks are located at 162.39 and 163.48 eV, consistent with the 160–164 eV range of S in the sulfide phase. In the XPS results, no other binding states, such as Cu(II) or Sn(II), are detected. Therefore, the XPS results are consistent with those reported in the literature and further demonstrate the single crystal CZTS structures.32,33

3.2. Photoelectrochemical performances
To evaluate the capability of light absorption for photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications, three samples of the bare ZnO NRs, the CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs and the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs were studied respectively. In general the capability of optical absorption is related to band gap energy of the material, which can be estimated by using the curve of (αhν)2versus hν (α = absorbance, h = Planck's constant, and ν = frequency). Fig. 5a shows that the obtained optical band gap energy of the bare ZnO NRs, the CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs and the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs is 3.15, 2.34, and 1.82 eV, respectively. Consistent with the band gap energy, the spectral region at wavelengths below 400 nm is dominated by the ZnO NRs; between 400 and 550 nm, the CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs have an almost equal optical absorption ability compared to the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs; beyond 550 nm, significant increased absorption in the visible light is observed for the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs (Fig. 5b). It confirms that CZTS is more effective in broadening the light absorption than CdS due to its narrower band gap energy of 1.82 eV than CdS by about 2.34 eV.

Then, the PEC performance of the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs for hydrogen generation was characterized by the chopped sweep photocurrent density as a function of applied bias voltage under white light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G), as shown in Fig. 6a. All of the measurements were conducted in a three-electrode electrochemical cell with a Pt wire and a saturated calomel electrode as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A mixed aqueous solution containing 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 (pH ∼ 12.5) was used as the electrolyte and sacrificial reagent. For the bare ZnO NRs, a negligible photocurrent of about 0.06 mA cm−2 at 0.0 VSCE was detected due to its wide band gap of 3.15 eV and limited absorption in the UV light region. The deposited CdS layer can greatly improve the photocurrent to 5.7 mA cm−2 at 0.0 VSCE due to its absorption edge extended to 550 nm. Coinciding with the light absorption, the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs generate the highest photocurrent of about 7.9 mA cm−2 at a potential of 0.0 VSCE. This can be attributed to the improved visible light absorption by CZTS, as shown in the UV-vis absorption spectra.
 Fig. 6  (a, b) Photocurrent density vs. voltage curves (a) and IPCE (b) obtained from the bare ZnO NRs, CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs and CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs, respectively. 
To further demonstrate the high PEC efficiencies of the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the three samples as a function of photon wavelength was examined. Fig. 6b shows that the CdS/ZnO and CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs exhibit a high IPCE of about 45 and 47%, respectively, while the IPCE values of the bare ZnO NRs are very low. The quantum yield of the CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs occurs in a narrow region between 370 and 560 nm due to the limited absorption ability of CdS. In contrast, the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs exhibit wider IPEC values than the CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs at 370–700 nm, which is also in accord with the aforementioned I–V and UV-vis absorption results.
For a better understanding of the intrinsic advantages of the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs in PEC applications, it is necessary to study their band alignment. It is well known that many research studies have demonstrated the importance of designing and manipulating the energy band alignment in composite nanomaterials for fundamentally improving charge separation and transport and thereby PEC properties. In this study, the valence band offset (VBO) at the CZTS/CdS/ZnO interface was obtained by using core-level XPS data and UPS.
The VBO can be estimated by the following formula (1):34 VBO = ECZTSVB − ECdSVB + Vbb,(1)where ECZTSVBand ECdSVBare the energy positions of the valence band edges of CZTS and CdS, respectively. Vbbis the band bending, which is calculated by formula (2): Vbb = (ECdSCd 3d − ECZTS/CdSCd 3d) + (ECZTS/CdSSn 3d − ECZTSSn 3d),(2)where ECdSCd 3dand ECZTSSn 3dare the core-level energies of Cd 3d and Sn 3d in the bulk region of CdS and CZTS, respectively. ECZTS/CdSCd 3d and ECZTS/CdSSn 3dare the core-level energies of Cd 3d and Sn 3d, respectively. It is assumed that the binding energy below the Fermi level is negative, and the VBO should be negative if the valence band edge of CdS is lower than that of CZTS. Fig. 7a shows the UPS data of CdS and CZTS. The valence band maximum (VBM) values were estimated by linear extrapolation. The VBM values, referred to the vacuum level, of CdS and CZTS are located at −1.59 ± 0.1 and −0.46 ± 0.1 eV, respectively. To determine the VBO of CZTS/CdS, the core-level values of CdS, CZTS and CdS/CZTS were measured. As shown in Fig. 7b, the Cd 3d5/2 and Sn 3d5/2 peaks in the CdS and CZTS were found to be 404.49 ± 0.05 and 486.98 ± 0.05 eV, respectively. The Cd 3d5/2 peak in CdS/CZTS is located at 405.01 ± 0.05 eV, and the Sn 3d5/2 peak is located at 487.12 ± 0.05 eV. According to formula (1), the VBO of the CZTS/CdS interface is estimated to be −0.75 ± 0.1 eV. The conduction band offset (CBO) can then be determined using the VBO and band gap values via CBO = ECdSg − ECZTSg + VBO, where ECdSgand ECZTSg are the band gaps of CdS and CZTS, respectively. Similarly, the VBO of CdS/ZnO can also be calculated. The conduction band maximum (CBM) of CdS is lower than that of CZTS, which gives a type II alignment at the CZTS/CdS interface. According to the above equation, the CBM of ZnO is lower than that of CdS, also indicating a type II alignment at the CdS/ZnO interface. A scheme of the estimated band alignment in CZTS/CdS/ZnO is presented in Fig. 8a. The cascade type II band alignment (cliff-like CBO) for CZTS/CdS/ZnO enables efficient exciton separation, as the electrons can easily cross the interfaces of CZTS/CdS and CdS/ZnO. However, the cliff-like band alignment can have a negative influence on photo-generated carrier recombination at the CZTS/CdS interface due to the small band-gap difference between the VBM of CZTS and CBM of CdS, leading to a low open circuit voltage (VOC) of the solar cell.35,36 According to other results, a small CBO spike, such as that at the CIGS/CdS interface, inhibits recombination between electrons in the CB of the CdS and holes in the valence band of the CIGS.36,37 For this reason, an anodic shift of the onset potential was found after spin-coating the CZTS layer on the CdS/ZnO NW electrode, as was a slightly decreased photocurrent between −1.25 V and −0.58 V. Furthermore, it can be seen from Fig. 8a that under irradiation, photogenerated electrons in the narrow bandgap semiconductor CZTS are injected into the conduction band of CdS and then into the ZnO, while the remaining holes in the cathode oxidize the S2− ions into S22− ions. Through the multi-level band position of the electrodes, electrons pass through CZTS to the FTO substrate and then transfer to the Pt counter electrode. The electrons at the Pt counter electrode were consumed to reduce H+ to H2. The role of the sacrificial reagent in the electrolyte (SO32−) is to prevent a back reaction by reducing S22− to S2−. This figure explains the mechanism for PEC hydrogen generation in our system.

Finally, the upper storey of the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs covered on the steel mesh and the bottom storey of the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs grown on the FTO were combined together. Then, the current–potential measurements for the two-storey composite nanostructures (blue curve), the upper storey (red curve) and the bottom storey (black curve) were performed separately and compared. Fig. 8b shows that the two-storey composite nanostructures exhibit the highest photocurrent density of about 12.5 mA cm−2 at 0.0 VSCE, which is ascribed to effective light absorption of the two-storey 3D composite structures and efficient charge transfer/separation through the cascade band structures of the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs decreasing from 3.15 to 1.82 eV. Because the light passing through the upper mesh holes can be absorbed at the bottom of the FTO electrode, the photocurrent is lower than the sum of the current density of the single mesh electrode and the single FTO electrode. However, because the reverse side of the mesh can also absorb reflected and scattered light from the bottom FTO electrode at the two-storey structure, the photocurrent density is increased. The photocurrent of the two-storey structured electrode is improved by 200% and 131% than the mesh-based single electrode and FTO based single electrode, respectively. The photocurrent densities of the mesh-based CZTS/CdS/ZnO NWs, FTO-based CZTS/CdS/ZnO NWs and layered structure electrodes are summarized in Table 1. Furthermore, the ZnO NRs grown on the steel mesh in the upper storey, at the same time, the ZnO NRs on FTO in the bottom storey provide a direct charge transfer path, and the CZTS/CdS layer widens the light absorption region from UV to near IR. Comparatively, the upper storey with the mesh grid structure shows the lowest current density, which is due to its porous structure allowing light penetration through the mesh holes. This result proves that our unique structure of the two storey 3D composite photoanode is highly efficient as a photoanode for PEC hydrogen generation.

4. Conclusions
In summary, a two-storey 3D CZTS/CdS/ZnO@steel composite nanostructure was prepared by using an environmentally friendly and cost-effective solution process. As the photoelectrode, this structure exhibits a high photocurrent density of about 12.5 mA cm−2 at 0.0 VSCE. Our study demonstrates that highly efficient photoelectrochemical performance comes from three crucial ways: the efficient light sensitizing properties of CZTS, the cascade band gaps decreasing from 3.15 to 1.82 eV of the CZTS/CdS/ZnO hetero-NRs and the two-storey 3D structure for effective light absorption. As a result, through these type II band structures, the photogenerated electrons facilely transfer from the CZTS to the ZnO NR, and migrate into the Pt counter electrode where they are consumed to generate hydrogen gases successfully. The strategy presented in the current study can be applied to enhance the solar energy conversion efficiency in other types of solar devices.
