    , Accepted 12th December 2018First published on 13th December 2018AbstractLightweight and flexible photovoltaic devices have attracted great interest for specific potential applications, such as miniaturized drones, blimps, and aerospace electronics. This study aims to demonstrate ultralight and flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with orthogonal silver nanowire (AgNW) transparent electrodes fabricated on 1.3 μm-thick polyethylene naphthalate foils. The smooth surface morphologies of the orthogonal AgNW transparent electrodes help prevent nonconducting silver halide formation generated by chemical reaction between the AgNWs and iodine in the active layer. The resultant PSCs with orthogonal AgNW transparent electrodes exhibit substantially improved device performance, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.18%, over PSCs with random AgNW network electrodes (10.43% PCE). Moreover, ultralight and flexible PSCs with the orthogonal AgNW electrodes exhibit an excellent power-per-weight of 29.4 W g−1, which is the highest value reported for a lightweight solar cell device. These lightweight energy harvesting platforms can be further expanded for various wearable optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
With the recent development in the field of energy harvesting devices, flexible and wearable photovoltaic devices have attracted a significant amount of attention as portable and wearable power sources in applications such as smart windows, wearable personal electronic devices, biomedical monitoring, and wearable textiles.1–6 In particular, lightweight and ultrathin solar cells can minimize energy consumption by increasing the power-per-weight, which provides primary benefits for future power sources in specific applications, such as miniaturized drones or blimps, aerospace electronics, and weather balloons.1 To increase the power-per-weight, researchers have developed various lightweight solar cells based on silicon (Si), organic, and perovskite solar cell (PSC) technologies.1,7–12 Among these, PSCs, which feature solution processability and high light absorption coefficient, are considered a promising flexible and lightweight power source; both the device efficiency and stability of PSCs have progressed rapidly.13–15 The development of planar-heterojunction perovskite materials enables the construction of flexible PSCs on polymer substrates due to low-temperature solution processing.16,17 In addition, the high absorption coefficient of the perovskite material enables the active layer of the device to be very thin (less than 1 μm), resulting in a PSC with high flexibility.14 Recently, Kaltenbrunner et al. reported a high power-per-weight of ∼23 W g−1 for flexible PSCs fabricated on ultrathin polymer foils, which introduces the possibility of lightweight PSC devices.1
During the fabrication of such lightweight PSCs, the device integration with flexible transparent electrodes is a critical factor that should be carefully considered to ensure proper device performance and mechanical stability for flexible PSCs. Therefore, the realization of lightweight and flexible PSCs requires the fabrication of flexible transparent electrodes with high conductivity and excellent mechanical robustness as replacements for the conventional indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes, whose brittle nature has limited their use in flexible applications.18,19 Till date, several approaches for the fabrication of high-performance flexible PSCs using various alternatives to ITO, such as metal nanowires,20–22 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),23,24 graphene,7,25 and metal mesh,10,26 have been reported. Among these conducting nanomaterials, silver nanowire (AgNW) networks have been used as an attractive flexible transparent electrode in various photovoltaic devices owing to their excellent electrical and optical properties and outstanding mechanical flexibility.27–29 In addition, AgNW networks can be readily deposited using solution processing methods, such as spin coating,30 bar coating,28,31 spray coating,32 and vacuum filtration.33 However, such conventional solution-based processes result in random AgNW networks, which limits the application of AgNWs in high-performance flexible PSCs due to the problems related to NW aggregation; specifically, low transmittance and high surface roughness.27,34 In particular, during the fabrication of PSCs, AgNWs are severely damaged by the halogen ions present in the perovskite active layer, resulting in the formation of a nonconducting silver halide phase, which decreases the electrical conductivity of the AgNWs.10,21,22
To overcome the aforementioned limitations, researchers have attempted to prevent the diffusion of halogen ions by depositing passivation layers onto random AgNW networks.21,22 Lee et al. reported that the iodide ions in PbI2 and CH3NH3PbI lead to a chemical reaction between AgNWs and iodine species, resulting in the formation of AgI, which in turn leads to the diffusion of Ag+ from the AgNWs through defect sites in stacked layers. Thus, they developed AgNW-based flexible PSC devices with an amorphous metal oxide protective layer on both sides of the AgNW layer; their device achieved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.23%.22 Kim et al. reported the fabrication of all-solution-based transparent electrodes with random AgNW networks embedded in both sol–gel ITO and zinc oxide layers, which effectively prevented the formation of silver halides during the fabrication of PSCs.21 However, such methods require complex fabrication processes to form the oxide/metal NW/oxide structure or a thick buffer layer to fully cover protruding NWs in random AgNW networks. In addition, further improvement in the device efficiency remains a challenge that must be overcome to enable the practical application of AgNWs in flexible devices. Therefore, a method that enables manipulation of the surface morphology of AgNW networks to efficiently prevent silver halide formation and simultaneously improve device efficiency is needed.
In this study, we demonstrate the fabrication of PSC devices with orthogonal AgNW transparent electrodes. The orthogonal orientation of the AgNWs effectively prevents the formation of silver halide during the PSC device fabrication because of the smooth surface morphology, resulting in a higher device efficiency of 15.18% for the orthogonal AgNW electrodes on glass substrates compared with that (10.43%) of electrodes with random AgNWs. In addition, we present ultralight and flexible PSC devices with orthogonal AgNW electrodes fabricated on ultrathin (1.3 μm-thick) polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) foils. In addition to achieving an outstanding power-per-weight of 29.4 W g−1 with a PCE of 12.85%, the PSCs can be attached to an arbitrary surface because of their low thickness and weight.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Fabrication of ultrathin transparent electrodes with orthogonal AgNW arrays
The 1.3 μm-thick PEN foil was utilized as an ultrathin substrate, which was purchased from a commercial company (GoodFellow Corp.). To support ultrathin PEN foil as the substrate, planar polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films were prepared by mixing silicone elastomer base (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) and curing agent in a ratio of 10:1. The mixture of liquid PDMS prepolymer was poured into Petri dishes and stored in a vacuum desiccator for 30 min to eliminate air bubbles. The liquid PDMS prepolymer was then solidified at 90 °C for 3 h. The 1.3 μm-thick PEN foil was physically adhered onto a planar PDMS film. The PEN foil on the PDMS film was treated with O2 plasma for 5 min to provide hydrophilicity and surface wettability. The as-treated PEN foil was then functionalized with amine groups using 0.1% poly-L-lysine (PLL) chemical solution in H2O, which were spin-coated onto substrates at 4000 rpm for 60 s. Next, orthogonal AgNW networks were fabricated on substrates terminated with amine functional groups by second-step capillary printing. Here, 0.5 wt% AgNW dispersions (average length and average diameter of 25 ± 5 μm and 32 ± 5 nm, respectively) in ethanol (Nanopyxis Corp.) were used.
2.2 Materials and preparation of perovskite
Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used without purification. Lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.999%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Two-kinds of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) were acquired from H. C. Starck (Germany). To distinguish the scientific terms of two-kinds of PEDOT:PSS solutions, we defined the terms as AI4083 and PH1000, respectively, which are the name of the products in the company. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) and methylammonium bromide (MABr) were prepared according to a previously reported procedure.35 To prepare perovskite precursor solutions, 1.4 mM of PbI2 was dissolved in 1 mL of DMF, and the concentration of MAI precursor was varied from 50 to 65 mg mL−1 in IPA. A 25 mg mL−1 solution of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was prepared in a 1:1 mixture of chlorobenzene and chloroform. The obtained solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 min.
2.3 Device fabrication
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultra-sonication in deionized water, acetone, and IPA for 10 min each. For glass/ITO devices, an AI4083 layer was deposited onto cleaned ITO substrates by spin-casting at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 140 °C for 10 min. For glass/AgNW and flexible AgNW substrates, a PH1000 was spin cast for 2000 rpm for 40 s and annealed 140 °C for 15 min. An AI4083 layer was deposited onto the PH1000 layer by spin-casting at 1500 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 140 °C for 10 min. For ultralight substrates, a PH1000 layer was spin cast at 2000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 80 °C for 30 min. An AI4083 layer was then deposited onto the PH1000 layer by spin-casting at 1500 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 80 °C for 30 min. On top of the hole transport layer, PbI2 solution was spin-coated at 5000 rpm and MAI/MABr mixed precursor solutions were spin cast at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The films were dried on a hotplate at 100 °C for 2 min under air atmosphere. After the substrates cooled, solvent vapor annealing (SVA) was carried out using 40 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent for 2 min at 100 °C. On top of the perovskite layer, PC61BM was spin cast at 1500 rpm. Subsequently, an aluminum (Al) electrode with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited onto the PC61BM layer under vacuum (<10−6 Torr) by thermal evaporation.
2.4 Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2635A source meter. Solar cell performance was characterized with the cells under illumination by an air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Apertures (13.0 mm2) made of thin metal were attached to each cell before measurement of the J–V characteristics. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were obtained with a PV measurement QE system under ambient conditions with monochromated light from a Xe arc lamp. The monochromatic light intensity was calibrated with a Si photodiode and chopped at 100 Hz. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using an ESCALAB 250XI from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The power-per-weight is defined as the ratio between the device output power per unit area under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination and device weight per unit area. The ultralight PSCs achieved a PCE of 12.85% and weighed ∼4.37 g m−2. Therefore, the device would generate a 128.5 W m−2 power output, with a specific weight of 29.4 W g−1.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows a schematic of the fabrication process for ultralight and flexible PSCs with orthogonal AgNW transparent electrodes on ultrathin 1.3 μm-thick PEN foils. We first prepared PDMS films, which were subsequently laminated onto glass substrates. Subsequently, ultrathin 1.3 μm-thick PEN foils were physically attached to the surface of the PDMS films for the easy handling of devices during the fabrication process. Notably, the thermal expansion of polymer substrates should be carefully considered to obtain high-performance device, which can cause internal stresses and strains in the active layer during the fabrication process. For this reason, we have used 1.3 μm-thick PEN foils as ultrathin substrates that provide a high-temperature tolerance up to 155 °C with a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) value (∼20 × 10−6 K−1, GoodFellow Corp.), which can minimize the thermal expansion mismatch between the polymer substrate and stacked layers.36,37 For the transparent electrodes, orthogonal AgNW electrodes were fabricated using a capillary printing technique.24 Next, PH1000 as a passivation layer and AI4083 as a hole-transporting layer (HTL) were over-coated onto the orthogonal AgNW electrodes. Here, we have employed the dispersion of AgNWs with a high aspect ratio of ∼781 to achieve high-efficient transparent electrodes as well as smooth surface morphology. Especially, the large diameter of AgNWs at NW–NW contact points can lead to protruding NWs out of the surface of PH1000 layer as defect sites in the PSC devices. The perovskite active layers were deposited via a standard two-step sequential deposition method.38 After the deposition of the top electrodes, the as-fabricated ultralight and flexible PSCs were physically released from the PDMS films and were free-standing. The resultant orthogonal AgNW electrodes provide several advantages, such as a uniform electrical current path, smooth surface morphologies, and superior transmittance, which increase the charge carrier diffusion lengths and reduce charge recombination to achieve high performance of PSCs.39,40

Fig. 1b shows a dark-field optical micrograph of the orthogonal AgNW network. It indicates a highly oriented NW surface morphology. The inset fast Fourier transform (FFT) image exhibits a clear cross pattern, indicating excellent alignment of the orthogonal AgNW networks. On the contrary, random AgNW networks show disordered surface structures, resulting in a blurry circular pattern in the FFT image (Fig. S1†). The optical transmittance spectra in the visible wavelength range of 350–800 nm show that the orthogonal AgNW electrodes exhibit higher transmittance (92.3% at 550 nm) than random AgNW electrodes with a similar sheet resistance (90.8% at 550 nm) because of the orthogonal AgNW electrodes' lower percolation threshold (Fig. S2†).28
The ultrathin conductive foil with orthogonal AgNW networks (Fig. 1c) is highly flexible and transparent. Fig. 1d shows an ultralight and flexible PSC with an orthogonal AgNW electrode foil adhered to the surface of a leaf, demonstrating the high adhesive capability due to the very small thickness and lightness of the device, which can facilitate the use of our PSCs as a wearable power source. Fig. 1e shows a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of our PSC with orthogonal AgNW electrodes. PSC devices are based on p–i–n device structures with a configuration of PEN/orthogonal AgNW electrode/PH1000/AI4083/CH3NH3PbBrxI3−x(MAPbBrxI3−x)/PC61BM/Al. The energy band diagram of the PSC devices is shown in Fig. S3.†
To investigate the mechanical robustness of the orthogonal AgNW electrode foils, the resistance of the orthogonal AgNW electrodes was monitored under various mechanical deformations, such as bending, crumpling, and twisting. The orthogonal AgNW electrode foil sustains its electrical resistance without substantial variation during repeated bending cycles (1000 times) at a bending radius of 2 mm (Fig. 1f), repeated crumpling cycles (500 times) (Fig. 1g), and twisting deformation at twisting angles from 0° to 900° (Fig. 1h). The outstanding mechanical durability of the orthogonal AgNW electrode foils is attributed to their uniform conductive networks bonding via an electrostatic force induced by chemically modified substrates with amine functional groups.28
During the fabrication of AgNW-based PSC devices, the formation of nonconducting silver halides, which substantially reduces the electrical conductivity of the AgNW electrodes, is a critical issue. To address this problem, we deposited a PH1000 layer as a passivation layer to minimize the formation of AgI during fabrication of the AgNW-based PSC devices.10 The smooth surface morphologies of the orthogonal AgNW electrodes laminated with a PH1000 layer can effectively prevent the reaction between AgNWs and iodide ions. On the contrary, protruding NWs induced by the aggregation of random AgNW networks cannot be fully covered by PH1000 layers, allowing iodide ions to easily diffuse into exposed AgNWs, resulting in a decrease of the electrical conductivity (Fig. 2a).

(e–h) Mapping images for the binding energy of Ag 3d originating from XPS depth profiles of PSCs with orthogonal AgNW and random AgNW electrodes (e and f) before and (g and h) after aging for 10 days. 
To verify the smooth surface morphologies of the orthogonal AgNW electrodes, we analyzed the surface of AI4083 layers deposited onto PH1000/orthogonal and random AgNW electrodes (Fig. S4†). The AI4083/PH1000 layer does not efficiently cover the whole area of the random AgNW network because the AgNWs are aggregated, resulting in a poor surface morphology. Note that thicker AI4083/PH1000 layers does not guarantee uniform and smooth surface coverage for random AgNWs because the height of aggregated NWs, stacked by several NWs, is too large to be fully covered (Fig. S5†). On the contrary, the orthogonal AgNW/PH1000 electrode exhibits a uniform and smooth surface morphology with excellent surface coverage of AgNWs. To further investigate the smooth morphologies of orthogonal AgNW electrodes, we measured the surface roughness of AI4083 films deposited onto orthogonal and random AgNW/PH1000 electrodes using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 2b and c reveal that the surface of the AI4083 film on orthogonal AgNW/PH1000 electrodes is smoother (root-mean-square roughness, Rq = 1.47 nm) than that on the random AgNW electrodes (Rq = 4.8 nm), which is consistent with the surface morphologies observed by SEM. These topological results indicate that the orthogonal AgNW/PH1000 electrodes can prevent the formation of AgI more effectively than random AgNW electrodes.
To certify the capability of the orthogonal AgNW electrode to prevent AgI formation during the fabrication of a PSC device, we monitored the variation in the electrical resistance of orthogonal and random AgNW/PH1000/AI4083 films during device fabrication, where the perovskite active films were subjected to a SVA process with DMSO solution.
Here, the vaporization of DMSO solvent provides a wet environment so that mixed MAI/MABr and PbI2 precursor molecules and ions can diffuse a long distance, resulting in an increase of the grain size from 200 nm to greater than 1 μm as a function of SVA time, which can improve the efficiency of the device (Fig. S6†).41 However, the diffusion of iodide species into the AgNW electrode during the SVA process promotes the formation of AgI, leading to a further degradation of electrical conductivity. As a result, the film with an orthogonal AgNW network maintains its initial electrical resistance without substantial loss of electrical conductivity during the entire fabrication process, whereas the film with a random AgNW network exhibits a rapid increase in sheet resistance (Fig. 2d), indicating a severely damaged AgNW network. Note that a thicker PH1000 layer does not ensure high device performance even though if it fully covers the protruding NWs of the random AgNW network because a thicker PH1000 layer also results in a decrease of the charge collection efficiency and series resistance.42
To better understand the ability of the orthogonal AgNW electrode to prevent AgI formation, we performed XPS depth profile analysis of orthogonal AgNW/PH1000/HTL/perovskite and random AgNW/PH1000/HTL/perovskite films. The as-fabricated films were subjected to an aging process for 10 days in a N2-filled glove box at room temperature. The mapping images of the binding energy of Ag+ ions before and after the aging treatment were constructed using XPS analysis (Fig. 2e–h). The y-axis scale in the mapping images indicates the etching time, which corresponds to the depth of the device. The XPS spectrum of an as-fabricated sample with a random AgNW network shows both Ag+ ions and Ag metal peaks at 367.9 and 368.2 eV, respectively, indicating that Ag+ ions were present in the perovskite active layer because of the reaction of Ag metal with the iodine of the perovskite solution. On the contrary, the spectra of the orthogonal AgNW electrodes show only a Ag metal peak at 368.2 eV; thus, Ag atoms did not diffuse from their corresponding positions in the AgNWs (Fig. 2e and f). In addition, the spectrum of the orthogonal AgNW network aged for 10 days shows no changes in the binding energy or peak position, whereas the random AgNW network aged for 10 days exhibited remarkable diffusion of Ag+, as evidenced by a shift in the binding energy, leading to AgI formation along the top regime of the device (Fig. 2g and h). These XPS results imply that the orthogonal AgNW system effectively prevents direct contact between the perovskite photoactive layer and AgNW electrode.43
To validate the effect of the orthogonal AgNW electrode on the device performance of AgNW-based PSCs, we measured J–V characteristics for PSC devices with ITO, orthogonal AgNW, and random AgNW electrodes under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 3a). The control PSCs were prepared with the architecture of glass/ITO/AI4083/MAPbBrxI3−x/PC61BM/Al. The PSCs with orthogonal AgNW have a structure of glass/orthogonal AgNW/PH1000/AI4083/MAPbBrxI3−x/PC61BM/Al while the PSCs with random AgNW have a structure of glass/random AgNW/PH1000/AI4083/MAPbBrxI3−x/PC61BM/Al. The PSCs with ITO electrodes exhibited a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 20.09 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.00 V, fill factor (FF) of 79%, and overall PCE of 16.25% (Table 1). Notably, the PSCs with orthogonal AgNW electrodes achieved an outstanding PCE of 15.18% with a JSC of 18.63 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.06 V, and FF of 77%, whereas those with random AgNW electrodes yielded a PCE of 10.43% with JSC of 14.88 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.03 V, and FF of 68%. The improved VOC in the HTL/perovskite device can be explained by the schematic energy diagram shown in Fig. S3.† The VOC is usually determined by the built in potential (Vbi) in the devices. In this case, Vbi in devices is dependent on the work function of AgNW/PH1000/AI4083 rather than on the work function of ITO/AI4083. When the work function of AgNW/PH1000/AI4083 is effectively aligned with the ionization potential of perovskite photoactive layer, the potential energy loss at the interface will be minimized.44 The high performance of the PSCs with the orthogonal AgNW electrodes is attributed to the uniform and homogenous perovskite photoactive layer on the flat HTL, which can increase the charge collection efficiency and reduce the recombination by the smooth surface of the orthogonal AgNW electrodes without forming AgI. In the contrary, we confirmed that the device efficiency of the PSCs with random AgNW electrodes did not exhibit a significant improvement although the PCE value was gradually increased as the thickness of PH1000 layer increases (Fig. S7†). In the forward scan direction, notably we obtained average value, the PSCs with ITO electrodes showed a PCE of 15.68 ± 0.072% with a JSC of 20.46 ± 0.099 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.00 ± 0.001 V, and FF of 76 ± 0.2%. The PSCs with orthogonal AgNW electrodes exhibited a PCE of 14.81 ± 0.285% with a JSC of 17.98 ± 0.282 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.05 ± 0.003 V, and FF of 78 ± 1.4% whereas the PSCs with random AgNW electrodes exhibited a PCE of 9.80 ± 0.519% with a JSC of 14.27 ± 0.576 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.02 ± 0.012 V, and FF of 67 ± 1% which are comparable to the characteristics of the backward scan, indicating that our PSC devices provide reliable device performance with negligible photocurrent hysteresis (Fig. S8†).45

EQE of PSC devices with ITO, orthogonal, and random AgNW electrodes shows a broad spectral response in the range of 300–780 nm, and the calculated current densities are 19.79, 17.51, and 14.07 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 3b). The integrated photocurrent of the devices shows good agreement with the value obtained from J–V curves (18.63 mA cm−2), within only 6% mismatch. To characterize the stability of the PSCs with orthogonal AgNW electrodes, we continuously monitored the device performance for an aging time of 500 h under a controlled atmosphere (N2-filled glove box). The PSCs with orthogonal AgNW electrodes showed improved long-term stability compared with the PSCs with random AgNW electrodes (Fig. 3c). For PSC devices with orthogonal AgNW electrodes, 85% of the initial PCE was retained after 500 h, whereas the PCE retention of the devices with random AgNW electrodes rapidly decreased to less than 50% after 500 h. This improved stability of devices with orthogonal AgNW electrodes is attributed to the prevention of the reaction between Ag+ and I− ions as a consequence of the smooth surface morphology, which is in good agreement with the XPS depth profile analysis. Fig. 3d presents the statistical analyses of the device performance of PSCs with ITO, orthogonal AgNW, and random AgNW electrodes. The devices with ITO and orthogonal AgNW electrodes show high reproducibility, with small variations in device efficiency, whereas the PSCs with random AgNW electrodes exhibit large variations in device performance.
To demonstrate the application of our orthogonal AgNW electrodes in a flexible device, we fabricated flexible PSCs with orthogonal AgNW electrodes on 1.3 μm-thick PEN foils (ultrathin PSCs) and on 120 μm-thick PEN films (thin PSCs) with the architecture of orthogonal AgNW/PH1000/AI4083/MAPbBrxI3−x/PC61BM/Al. Fig. 4a shows the J–V characteristics of the ultrathin and thin PSCs with orthogonal AgNW electrodes. Device efficiencies of 13.05% and 12.85% were achieved for the thin PSC and ultrathin PSC devices with orthogonal AgNW electrodes, respectively, which constitute the highest PCEs reported thus far for a flexible PSC with AgNW electrodes (Table S1†).21,22,46–48

(d) Comparison of the power-per-weight performances of the ultralight PSC and other types of light solar cells. 
To evaluate the mechanical durability of the flexible thin PSCs with orthogonal AgNW electrodes, we monitored the variation in the device performance for 1000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 5 mm (Fig. 4b). The flexible thin PSCs retained 80% of their initial PCE over 1000 bending cycles, without substantial degradation of the PCE value (Fig. S9†). One of important advantages of our devices is their lightweight property, which enables our devices to be floated even onto the surface of bubbles without bursting (Fig. 4c and Movie S1†). The ultralight property of our PSCs is highly advantageous in terms of the power-per-weight in the field of aerospace electronics or miniaturized blimps. For the proof-of-concept demonstration, we calculated the power-per-weight of our device, which weighed 0.74 mg (Fig. S10†); our ultralight and flexible PSC device exhibited an excellent power-per-weight of 29.4 W g−1 at a weight of 4.37 g m−2, which represents the highest value reported among various lightweight solar cells (Fig. 4d).1,8,9,49,50
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated ultrathin, lightweight, and flexible PSC devices with orthogonal AgNW transparent electrodes fabricated on ultrathin polymer foils. The orthogonal AgNW electrodes provide a smooth surface morphology and exhibit outstanding electrical and optical properties, which effectively prevent the formation of nonconducting AgI, resulting in an improved device efficiency, achieving a PCE of 15.18% in comparison with that of a device with random AgNW electrodes (10.43%). A PCE value of 13.05% for the flexible PSC with orthogonal AgNW electrodes was achieved, which is the highest device efficiency reported till date for an AgNW-based flexible PSC device. Furthermore, our ultralight PSC device fabricated on 1.3 μm-thick foil achieved a PCE of 12.85% with an excellent power-per-weight of 29.4 W g−1 at weight of 4.37 g m−2.
