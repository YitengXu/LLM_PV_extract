    , Accepted 6th June 2019First published on 6th June 2019AbstractBismuth-based halide perovskites (Bi-HaP) are low toxicity and air-stable materials with promising photo-absorber properties. In this study, we fabricated Bi-HaP (Cs3Bi2I9 and CsBi3I10) films by a solution process followed by solvent annealing and investigated the crystal growth and optoelectronic properties of these materials. A compact and large grain morphology of the Bi-HaP films was realized by annealing under ambient solvent vapor conditions. Collective analysis of XRD patterns, and Raman spectra, absorption and PL spectra of the fabricated films corroborates that the Cs3Bi2I9 film (Eg ∼ 2.08 eV) with a hexagonal crystal phase is more stable under annealing conditions in a wide temperature range and ambient solvent vapor annealing conditions as compared to the other CsBi3I10 thin film, having the narrower Eg ∼ 1.8 eV, of the Bi-HaP family. We have achieved the best power conversion efficiency as high as ∼1.26% with the open circuit voltage of 0.74 V for the device fabricated with Cs3Bi2I9. The analysis of material properties and device characteristics indicates that morphology tailoring, surface chemistry control, and interface band offset engineering are important for the further improvement of Bi-HaP-based devices.
1. Introduction
Lead halide perovskite (Pb-HaP) has emerged as a promising photo-absorber material, demonstrating power conversion efficiency (PCE) competitive with that of other PV technologies.1 However, some fundamental issues are associated with the commercialization of Pb-HaP PV devices: instability in ambient air2,3 and presence of a toxic heavy element (Pb).4–6 Therefore, it is important to explore nontoxic and stable perovskite-based alternative materials. As members of the Pb-HaP family, Sn- and Ge-based HaP materials have been explored to replace Pb-based perovskites;7,8 however, the unstable 2+ oxidation states of Sn and Ge are easily oxidized to 4+ states due to the lack of inert pair effect, occurring in the case of the Pb2+ ions; this is deleterious for achieving high-quality films, device performance, and stability.9–11
Among various alternatives, Bi- and Sb-based perovskite materials have been extensively investigated as possible candidates due to their promising optophysical properties and superior stability in ambient air;12–18 a number of research groups have suggested that the poor morphology of the fabricated film is a big hurdle in improving device performance.19–21 Johansson and co-workers have studied the photovoltaic characteristics of A3Bi2I9 using single-step spin coating on mesoporous TiO2.12 Ran et al. have employed a two-step deposition technique by evaporating BiI3 followed by spin coating with methylammonium iodide (MAI) to fabricate a compact film.22 Some groups19,20 have reported solvent-engineering or solvent-assisted crystallization approaches for improving the film morphology. In a recent study reported by Zhang and co-workers,23 a significant improvement in device performance has been demonstrated using ultrathin Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets in an n–i–p device structure by tuning the hole transport layer; moreover, the MA3Bi2I9 material has been explored to improve the device performance by tailoring the morphology and carrier transport engineering.24–26 Despite the superior stability of this material under an ambient atmosphere,27 the poor device performance is very disappointing. Although a number of studies have been focused on Pb-HaP devices,28 studies on the fundamental understanding of Bi-HaP materials are lacking. Therefore, it is imperative to extensively explore the crystal growth, morphology and optoelectronic properties of Bi-HaP to disentangle the limiting factors of device parameters for this class of materials.
In this study, we investigated the film growth and structural and optophysical properties of bismuth caesium halide perovskite (CBI) (CsBi3I10 (CBI-1) and Cs3Bi2I9 (CBI-2)) films deposited by a solution process for solar cell applications. It has been found that the CBI-2 film exhibits a stable single phase during growth in a wide temperature range. We have obtained large grain film morphology by solvent dripping followed by solvent annealing during crystallization. We demonstrated the inverted CBI-2 device with the best power conversion efficiency of (PCE) ∼ 1.26%. This was mainly achieved by improving the film quality (surface morphology and control of trace metal content) and interface band offset; we explored the limiting factors responsible for the poor performance of the CBI absorber layer and paved the way for the improvement of device properties.
2. Results and discussion
The Bi-HaP thin films were fabricated by a solution approach, as depicted in Fig. 1. To understand the film growth, we initially prepared Bi-HaP films of two compositions (CsBi3I10 (CBI-1) and Cs3Bi2I9 (CBI-2)) by conventional annealing (CA), as shown in Fig. 1c. Fig. 2 displays the morphology, structure and optophysical properties of the respective films. The SEM images of both films (Fig. 2a and b, respectively) demonstrate a comparatively rough morphology. The morphology of the CBI-1 film exhibits small granular crystals, whereas that of the CBI-2 film exhibits large grains with flake-like features; this is in agreement with previous studies.12,13 The XRD pattern of CBI-1 (Fig. 2c) exhibits a dominant peak of the (003) orientation along with those of (113) and (300); thus, CBI-1 exhibits crystal orientations very similar to those of the rhombohedral phase BiI3 crystal; this is consistent with the study reported by Johansson et al.;13 it is suggested that CBI-1 possesses a layered structure similar to that of BiI3; however, these layers are partly broken into a zero-dimensional structure as in the case of CBI-2. The CBI-2 film exhibits crystal growth with the most significant peak intensity for the (006) orientation (Fig. 2c) of the hexagonal phase.14,19 Since the XRD patterns are not very sensitive for the detection of impurities in the film, we have obtained the Raman spectra (Fig. 2d) for further confirmation of crystal quality. The Raman spectrum of the CBI-1 film exhibited characteristic peaks at 62, 104 and 146 cm−1. Similarly, the characteristic Raman peaks for the CBI-2 film were obtained at 62, 92, 104, and 146 cm−1. We also examined the Raman spectrum of the BiI3 film, which had characteristic peaks at 71, 84, 112, and 158 cm−1. These results are in agreement with those obtained via theoretical and experimental studies.29–31 Since the Raman peak at 112 cm−1 (Ag)30 is the main characteristic peak of BiI3, it cannot be excluded from the Raman spectrum of the Bi-HaP film. In addition, the CBI-1 and CBI-2 films contain very close characteristic peaks; thus, it is complicated to rule out the presence of these phases in both films. Thus, further studies are required to elucidate the existence of secondary phases and their impacts on the film quality.

Fig. 2e reveals the absorption spectra of the respective films. The CBI-1 film having a brown-blackish color exhibits the band gap energy (Eg) ∼ 1.80 eV (690 nm) along with an additional exciton absorption peak at ∼2.53 eV. On the other hand, the CBI-2 film having an orange-red color displays the Eg ∼ 2.08 eV (598 nm) with the additional exciton absorption peaks at 2.53 and 2.95 eV. The PL spectra (Fig. 2f) show peaks centered at ∼1.80 eV for the CBI-1 film and at ∼2.08 eV for the CBI-2 film. These results are in good agreement with those reported in previous studies.13,32 Although the absorption spectrum of the CBI-1 film possesses an additional slope with intercept at ∼1.95 eV, no such additional feature was noticed in the PL spectrum. Note that the absorption and PL spectra of the BiI3 thin film have shown close features, as observed in another study.33 Moreover, we observed a set of parasitic PL peaks in the lower energy regime. This is suggested to be an indication of cascade excitations, showing the possibility of re-absorption and re-emission of photons in micro-scale crystals. Irvine and co-workers34 have reported that the Bi-HaP film has highly anisotropic photoluminescence emission and excitation as a consequence of the large proportion of localized excitons coupled with delocalized excitons via intercluster energy transfer.
To investigate the effect of annealing temperature on the structural and optophysical properties of the Bi-HaP films, we fabricated thin films annealed at varying temperatures from 90 to 200 °C. Interestingly, the CBI-2 film shows almost identical XRD, Raman and PL spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†) when annealed at temperatures 90–200 °C. For a distinct comparison, we obtained the XRD patterns and PL spectra at 120 and 200 °C, as depicted in Fig. 3. For the CBI-1 film, the XRD patterns and Raman and PL spectra exhibit identical characteristics of the films annealed at 90–180 °C; on the other hand, the XRD patterns and Raman and PL spectra of the films annealed at 200 °C show characteristic features similar to those obtained in the case of the CBI-2 film; moreover, the CBI-2 film was found to be thermally stable. Moreover, a clear difference can be observed in the images (inset in Fig. 3a, b and Fig. S1a, ESI†). It is speculated that CsBi3I10 decomposes into Cs3Bi2I9 and BiI3; moreover, BiI3 further decomposes into metallic bismuth and iodine during annealing. The decomposition route is proposed as below. 3CsBi3I10 (s) → Cs3Bi2I9 (s) + 7BiI3 (s)(1) 2BiI3 (s) → 2Bi (s) + 3I2 (g)↑(2)Note that the formation of Cs3Bi2I9 (s) in reaction (1) results in the red appearance of the film. This is substantiated by the XRD and PL characteristics, as depicted in Fig. 3. The existence of metallic Bi (as shown in reaction (2)) has been detected in the CBI-1 film (via the XPS analysis and has been discussed in the succeeding paragraph), which supports the decomposition of BiI3. We have found that the Bi-HaP films annealed at 120 °C have better crystallinity and morphology. However, the crystallinity and morphology of the film annealed at 90 °C are comparatively poorer than that of the abovementioned two films, and annealing above 180 °C worsens the film morphology. Furthermore, to confirm the film stability, we examined the Bi-HaP film stored in ambient air for more than six months. The XRD patterns of the aged and fresh films (Fig. S2, ESI†) do not show any change; this ascertains the stability of the film in ambient air. This is important for device stability.

After investigating the material growth of the Bi-HaP films, we prepared a complete device with inverted configuration, as depicted in Fig. 4a. The J–V curves of the devices with the Bi-HaP films prepared by the CA method are shown in Fig. 4b. The device with CBI-2 exhibits poor efficiency with a diode curve, whereas that with the CBI-1 film exhibits significantly worse efficiency. This is primarily attributed to the poor morphology of the CBI-1 film as compared to that of the CBI-2 film. Therefore, it is urgent to improve the film morphology for the enhancement of device performance.

Herein, the symbols in the J–V curves stand for forward and reverse scan directions. The XPS spectra of the CBI-2 film (prepared by CA, AS, and AS + SA) are assigned for the core-level peak of Bi-4f (g). The two steric signs at ∼162 and 157 eV indicate metallic Bi0. 
To tailor the film morphology, we prepared films using antisolvent (AS) and subsequent ambient solvent vapor annealing (AS + SA) method, as depicted in Fig. 1(c-1 and c-2). This approach dramatically improved the film texture for the CBI-2 film, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. The morphology of the CBI-2 film has been found to be compact and more uniform after antisolvent dripping followed by ambient solvent vapor annealing. The XRD patterns (Fig. S3b, ESI†) exhibited intensified characteristic peaks, suggesting better crystal quality. Interestingly, the XRD patterns (Fig. S3a, ESI†) for the two CBI-1 films (CA and AS) are similar, whereas that for the CBI-1 film treated with AS + SA exhibits a contrast pattern with a dominant peak of (113) orientation and other peaks of (003) and (205) orientations. In our study, we have found that the Bi-HaP film is significantly sensitive under ambient solvent vapor annealing conditions. We must have well-controlled ambient DMF solvent vapor annealing for crystallization. Unexpectedly, the surface texture of the CBI-1 films (Fig. S4, ESI†) was not distinctly improved. However, we observed comparatively uniform grains for the film prepared with chlorobenzene dripping; on the other hand, the films prepared with CA and AS + SA were almost alike in appearance; moreover, the surface of the CBI-1 film contained small flake-like features as observed in the case of the CBI-2 film and small granular features as observed in the case of the BiI3 film (Fig. S5a, ESI†). Interestingly, we observed that the antisolvent treatment and ambient solvent vapor annealing distinctly affected the growth of the Bi-HaP films (CBI-1 and CBI-2). Buonassisi and co-workers19 have discussed the film formation mechanism of Bi-HaP-based perovskite by the solvent-engineering method. It has been suggested that the precursor supersaturation affects the grain nucleation and growth, which determines the morphology of the Bi-HaP film. Note that antisolvent dripping rapidly increases homogeneous nucleation, resulting in a compact film with smaller grains. In our study, we annealed the antisolvent-dripped CBI-2 film at slow evaporation rate by covering it with a Petri dish (as depicted in Fig. 1c-1); this prolonged the crystallization process (grain nucleation) and resulted in larger and homogeneous grains (Fig. 4d). Similarly, the antisolvent-dripped CBI-2 film was annealed under controlled ambient DMF vapor condition and covered by a Petri dish (Fig. 1c-2); this further prolonged the crystallization process, and hence, a compact film with homogeneous and large grains (Fig. 4e) was obtained. In the case of the CBI-1 film, the precursor (CsBi3I10; CsI:BiI3: 1:3) consists of a BiI3-rich composition. It has been reported that the DMF or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent forms bismuth complexes with BiI3, which affects the precursor supersaturation level and film formation.19 Therefore, annealing the CBI-1 film under the ambient DMF vapour conditions may affect the supersaturation level at the pre-crystallization stage of film growth; as a consequence, the BiI3-rich composition hinders the nucleation of grain and hence results in poor film morphology. A detailed discussion on the film formation mechanism is beyond the scope of this study.
To evaluate the impact of morphology on the device, we fabricated a device with CBI films and PEDOT:PSS as the HTL coupled with PCBM as the ETL. Unexpectedly, the J–V curves (Fig. S4b, ESI†) of the CBI-1 films prepared by the AS and AS + SA method do not show any improvement; this must be due to the poor film morphology or the existence of a trace of secondary phase in these films; since the CBI-1 film has similar characteristics to the BiI3 film, the BiI3 material has also been reported for solar cell application.35,36 Herein, we also prepared the BiI3 film with chlorobenzene dripping. Interestingly, the film morphology of BiI3 is rather uniform and compact (Fig. S5a, ESI†); the device with the bismuth trihalide (BiI3) film (Fig. S5b, ESI†) demonstrates a better J–V characteristic. This implied that poor film quality or surface chemistry might be detrimental to the performance of the device with the CBI-1 film. Fig. 4f shows the J–V curves of the devices with the CBI-2 films prepared by different annealing approaches (CA, AS, and AS + SA). The device parameters JSC, VOC, and FF (Table 1) are noticeably improved as compared to those of the device with the CBI-1 film; this is mainly attributed to the surface morphology tailoring of the CBI-2 film (Fig. 4c–e). Our results agree with previous studies on Bi-HaP-based solar cells.19,22 It has been documented that a large and uniform grain has a low grain boundary density, which reduces the recombination centers.37

Furthermore, we explored the surface chemistry of the Bi-HaP films by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The XPS core-level spectra (Fig. S6, ESI†) display the characteristic signals from the Cs-3d, Bi-4f, and I-3d electronic states. The XPS characteristics peaks for Cs-3d and I-3d are alike for both films. However, the shoulder peaks at ∼162 and 157 eV are detected in the core-level signal for Bi-4f in the CBI-1 film, which is much lower in the CBI-2 film. These peaks corresponded to metallic Bi0,14 which could be due to the decomposition of caesium bismuth iodide and bismuth triiodide during annealing, as abovementioned (reactions (1) and (2)). It is speculated that the volatility of BiI3 results in iodine-deficient stoichiometry, and a trace of metallic Bi0 state remains.14 Note that a trace of metallic Bi0 on the Bi-HaP film is notorious for the recombination centers and Fermi level pinning, which deteriorates the device performance. Thus, it is speculated that the surface with a trace metallic state can be one of the detrimental factors for the poor performance of the device with the CBI-1 film as compared to that of the device with the CBI-2 film. In the case of the CBI-2 film, as displayed in Fig. 4g, although a lower characteristic peak of metallic Bi0 exists in the film prepared by CA, it is significantly diminished in the CBI-2 film prepared by a controlled process (AS and AS + SA). This also supports the results obtained for the devices with CBI-2 (Fig. 4f and Table 1). This result indicates that the film morphology as well as the surface chemistry are extremely critical for the improvement of device performance.
Considering the wide band gap of the Bi-HaP materials with a deep valence band edge,14 apoor band alignment at the interface would lead to low device performance by constraining the device parameters. To investigate this issue, we fabricated devices with the CBI-2 film (prepared by AS + SA) employing different HTLs according to our experience with the lead halide perovskite-based devices.38,39 Herein, we focused only on devices with the CBI-2 film because of its better morphology and surface chemistry, as abovementioned. Note that the PTAA and NiOx HTLs have been plasma-treated prior to the deposition of the CBI-2 film on them; this is very important to mitigate the non-wettability of the surface and tune the HOMO and LUMO levels.40,41 The photoelectron spectra of the respective plasma-treated PTAA and NiOx films are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The energy band alignment is depicted in Fig. 5a. A cross-sectional image of the typical device (ITO/HTL/CBI-2/PCBM) is shown in Fig. 5b. The J–V curves show negligible hysteresis (Fig. 5c). The figures of merit (Table 1) of the best devices demonstrate a significant improvement in device parameters. The devices with organic HTLs (PEDOT:PSS, PTAA) have a lower device performance than the device with NiOx. Herein, we achieved the best device performance of ∼1.26% efficiency with NiOx, accompanied by improved VOC (0.742 V), FF (0.507), and JSC (3.416 mA cm−2). The enhancement in device parameters is attributed to the better interface quality, improved band alignments, and efficient carrier transport. Note that the band offset at the Bi-HaP/HTL is diminished with the plasma-treated HTL, which increases the built-in potential, improves the interfacial carrier transport and hence enhances the device parameters.19,40 This study suggests that the optimization of surface morphology and interface band offset is very important for the further improvement of Bi-HaP-based devices. Fig. 5d shows the spectral response (EQE) of the respective devices. The integrated JSC estimated from the EQE spectra is in agreement with the values obtained from the respective J–V curves. A lower and significantly varied response can be observed in the absorption range of the CBI-2 film (∼400–600 nm). This is correlated to the kinetically favourable interface barrier and the quality of the interface and absorber layer. Furthermore, Fig. 5e displays a steady-state photocurrent of ∼3.42 mA cm−2 over a period of one minute at MPPT under one sun illumination, which corresponds to the steady-state PCE of ∼1.26% for the CBI-2 device with NiOx. We also monitored the stability of the device stored in the air under ambient conditions. The device demonstrated promising stability, as depicted in Fig. 5f, which retained over 95% of its original PCE after 30 days. This result clearly demonstrates that the Bi-HaP device is more stable than the Pb- and Sn-based HaP devices.42 Therefore, it can be a promising alternative to Pb-based perovskite devices to resolve the toxicity and instability issues if we achieve competitive performance of the Bi-HaP-based perovskite devices. Indeed, there is a significant scope to alter the band alignment for favourable carrier kinetics and improvement in the film quality of Bi-HaP to achieve better device performance.

To obtain further insight, we have analyzed the capacitance–voltage data response, which has been rarely reported for this class of materials. We carried out capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements and extracted the Mott–Schottky plot (eqn (3), Fig. 6a) and carrier profile (eqn (4), Fig. 6b) estimated by the following relations:43 (3) (4)where C is capacitance per area, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, and εs is a dielectric constant of the perovskite layer, which is estimated from the plateau region of the capacitance–frequency (C–f) plot measured at zero bias under dark, as mentioned in our earlier reports.44VD is the diffusion potential, presented by VD = Vbi− EF/q; where EF is Fermi energy and Vbi is the built-in potential. NA is the carrier density corresponding to VD estimated using the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plot. The Mott–Schottky plots (Fig. 6a) show the impacts on diffusion potential (VD). The value of VD for the PEDOT:PSS device (0.33 V) is lower than those of the PTAA (0.48 V) and NiOx (0.74 V) devices. This can be partially contributed by more favourable band alignment and the optoelectronic quality of the films grown on the respective substrates. The slanted broader line in the M–S plot indicates p-type doping induced at the interface. The carrier profile estimated via the C–V analysis (Fig. 6b) shows the highest carrier density of ∼1 × 1017 cm−3 for PEDOT:PSS, whereas those for PTAA and NiOx lie in the range ∼3 × 1016 cm−3. Note that the carrier densities corresponding to the respective HTLs are approximately one order of magnitude higher than those of the Pb-based HaP devices reported in our previous studies.45 It has been reported that the carrier density estimated via the C–V analysis also influences the trap densities in the absorber layer.43 The higher carrier densities in our devices could be partially contributed from the traps induced in the Bi-HaP layer during crystallization. Note that the carrier profiles are slightly confined for the PEDOT:PSS device as compared to the case of the other devices. It also shows a narrow space charge region. This might be due to the Bi-HaP/HTL interfacial chemistry at the junction, interface defects and the film quality, which are indeed important for device optimization, as reported for the Pb-HaP-based perovskite device.46 Therefore, our study suggests that the exploration of many aspects, such as film quality, interface engineering and defect physics, of the Bi-HaP material are crucial to open up the potential of this material for efficient device performance as well as its applications in other optoelectronics fields.

3. Conclusions
Herein, we demonstrated a solution approach for the growth of high quality and compact Bi-HaP films by antisolvent dripping followed by solvent annealing. The growth and optophysical properties of Bi-HaP materials (Cs3Bi2I9 and CsBi3I10) were investigated by XRD patterns, Raman spectra, absorption spectra and PL spectra for application of these materials in a PV device. The Cs3Bi2I9 film (Eg ∼ 2.08 eV) shows rather high crystallinity (single crystal phase) and compact surface morphology than the CsBi3I10 film (Eg ∼ 1.80 eV), and hence, the performance of the device with the Cs3Bi2I9 film has been found to be superior although the CsBi3I10 film has a more suitable band gap for light harvesting. The performances of devices with the Cs3Bi2I9 film have been enhanced by diminishing the band offset using PTAA and NiOx, having deeper HOMO levels, in place of PEDOT:PSS as the HTL. The device with NiOx as the hole transport layer demonstrated the best PCE of 1.26% with the VOC ∼ 0.74 V and the JSC ∼ 3.42 mA cm−2, which was competitive with the best values reported using the Bi-HaP absorber layer. This is mainly attributed to the improved surface morphology, reduced interface energy barrier and increased diffusion potential. This study paves the way towards achieving high performance of Bi-HaP-based devices by further control of surface morphology/crystallinity and optimization of the interfacial carrier transport layer for efficient carrier kinetics.

We prepared 0.5 M precursor solutions (CsBi3I10 (CBI-1) and Cs3Bi2I9 (CBI-2)) by dissolving the CsI and BiI3 powder at the molar ratios of 1:3 and 3:2 in DMF and DMSO (7:3 (v:v)) at 70 °C for 12 hours, respectively. The BiI3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 50–150 mg mL−1 in DMF at 70 °C for 12 hours in a N2-filled glove box. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios, Al4083) was diluted by mixing with methanol at the ratio 3:7. The poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) (0.5 wt%) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) [Sigma Aldrich, 99% purity] solutions (2 wt%) were dissolved in anhydrous chlorobenzene (CB) at 50 °C for 7 hours. Aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) nanoparticle ink (Avantama, N-21X) was used. All solutions were filtered using 0.45 μm syringe filters to avoid unwanted particles in the precursor solutions.
Device fabrication
Solar cell devices were fabricated on pre-cleaned patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (15 Ω square−1). The ITO substrates were pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, pure water, and 2-propanol, followed by an ultraviolet-ozone treatment for 5 min to remove organic residuals. A thin PTAA HTM layer (∼20 nm) was deposited onto the ITO substrate by spin coating at 4000 rpm (2000 rpm s−1 speed) for 30 seconds and subsequently dried at 100 °C for 10 min on a hot plate in ambient nitrogen. Similarly, another thin HTM layer (∼30 nm) (PEDOT:PSS) was deposited onto the ITO substrate by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds and subsequently dried at 130 °C for 30 min on a hot plate in ambient air. The NiOx (∼30 nm) film was deposited by sputtering as mentioned in our earlier report. For the fabrication of the Bi-based based thin film, the precursor solution (CsBI-1 or CsBI-2 or BiI3) was spin coated at 1500 rpm for 20 s (ramping rate 500 rpm s−1) and 3000 rpm for 30 s. After spin coating, the films were crystallized by conventional annealing (CA) at various temperatures (90, 120, 150, 180, and 200 °C) for 60 minutes. For antisolvent (AS)-treated samples, 150 μL chlorobenzene was dripped 20 s after starting spin coating and annealed at 120 °C for 60 minutes. The solvent annealing of post antisolvent (AS)-dripped samples was carried out by putting about 5 μL of DMF at the edge of a cover glass at 120 °C for 60 minutes. For ETL, PC61BM was spin-coated on top of the Bi-HaP films at 800 rpm for 30 s, then at 4000 rpm for 10 s, and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, a thin electron selective layer (ESL) of AZO was deposited by spinning at 2000 rpm for 20 s and dried by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The device structure was completed by depositing 100 nm thermally evaporated Ag at <10−4 Pa. We sealed our devices of area ∼0.26 cm2 using UV-curable resins.
Device characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fabricated films were obtained using the Bruker D8 advance x-ray diffractometer (CuKα radiation, λ = 1.54050 A). The morphologies of the films and cross-sectional images were obtained by a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 5 kV accelerating voltage (Hitachi, S-4800). The absorption spectra and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of various films were measured using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer (7200, V-Jasco) and spectrofluorometer (FP8500, Jasco), respectively. Raman spectra were obtained using a micro Raman spectrometer (Horiba, green laser 532 nm). The HOMO levels of transport layers were measured using a photoelectron spectrometer (Riken Keiki, AC-3). XPS spectra were obtained using a VersaProbe II (ULVAC-PHI, Japan). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured at the scan rate of 0.05 V s−1 under 1 sun with an AM 1.5G spectral filter (100 mW cm−2) coupled with an MPPT system (Systemhouse Sunrise Corp.). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained using a spectrometer (SM-250IQE, Bunkokeiki, Japan). Capacitance–frequency response (C–f) was obtained using an LCR meter (E4980A, Agilent), which probes from 20 Hz to 2 MHz at the AC voltage amplitude of 30 mV under dark conditions. After confirming the geometric capacitance regime in C–f spectra, capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were carried out at 10 kHz (the geometric capacitance regime in C–f spectra).
