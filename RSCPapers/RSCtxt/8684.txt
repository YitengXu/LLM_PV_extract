    , Accepted 24th May 2016First published on 25th May 2016AbstractEfficient planar antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) heterojunction solar cells have been made using chemical bath deposited (CBD) Sb2S3 as the absorber, low-temperature solution-processed tin oxide (SnO2) as the electron conductor and poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the hole conductor. A solar conversion efficiency of 2.8% was obtained at 1 sun illumination using a planar device consisting of F-doped SnO2 substrate/SnO2/CBD-Sb2S3/P3HT/Au, whereas the solar cells based on a titanium dioxide (TiO2) electron conductor exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 1.9%. Compared with conventional Sb2S3 sensitized solar cells, the high-temperature processed mesoscopic TiO2 scaffold is no longer needed. More importantly, a low-temperature solution-processed SnO2 layer was introduced for electron transportation to substitute the high-temperature sintered dense blocking TiO2 layer. Our planar solar cells not only have simple geometry with fewer steps to fabricate but also show enhanced performance. The higher efficiency of planar Sb2S3 solar cell devices based on a SnO2 electron conductor is attributed to their high transparency, uniform surface, efficient electron transport properties of SnO2, suitable energy band alignment, and reduced recombination at the interface of SnO2/Sb2S3.
1 Introduction
Since the first report of silicon p–n junction photocells by Chapin, Fuller and Pearson in 1954,1 thin film solar cells (TFSCs) have been intensively studied and been significantly improved by many scientists.2–14 According to the latest photovoltaics report published by Fraunhofer ISE, Si-wafer based photovoltaic (PV) technology now accounts for most of the total PV production and the share of multi-crystalline technology is more than half of the total production.15 Recently, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) TFSCs have achieved certified solar energy conversion efficiencies of 21.7% and 21.5%, outperforming conventional multi-crystalline silicon (20.8%),16 the dominant material currently used in most solar photovoltaic systems. However, the toxicity of Cd, the scarcity of In and Te and the high price of In and Ga will restrict the application of these TFSCs. Apart from these mainstream solar absorber materials, many inorganic metal chalcogenides such as copper zinc tin selenide (CZTS), lead sulfide (PbS) and antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) have been investigated because of their unique characteristics such as strong absorption of incident light, a large dielectric constant and high air-stability.17,18 However, the usage of hydrazine, the complicated composition and defect control of the multi-compound of CZTS and the toxicity of Pb may become their drawbacks. Other potential materials such as copper(I) sulfide (Cu2S) and tin sulfide (SnS) have also been studied, but their efficiencies are lagging far behind those mainstream solar absorber materials.19,20
Among them, Sb2S3 has emerged as one of the most promising solar absorbers. Sb2S3 is a low band-gap semiconductor that has been frequently used as a sensitizer in mesoscopic titanium dioxide (TiO2) to fabricate solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).21,22 Sb2S3 absorber films are synthesized mostly by the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. Sb2S3 forms an amorphous phase on the substrates at the initial processing stage and then converts to crystalline stibnite by subsequent heat treatment. In its crystalline form (stibnite), Sb2S3 displays a band-gap of 1.5–1.8 eV, which nearly covers the whole sun spectrum, and it possesses a high absorption coefficient (>105 cm−1 at short wavelength). More importantly, Sb and S are earth-abundant, less toxic and air-stable materials, making Sb2S3 a very promising candidate for solar cell applications. So far, most of the relevant studies of Sb2S3 solar cells have been utilizing a structure of F-doped SnO2 (FTO) substrate/dense TiO2 blocking layer/mesoscopic TiO2 scaffold/Sb2S3/hole conductor/Au. By choosing different hole conductors, such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD),23 an inorganic p-type material CuSCN,24 a conducting polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)25 and a newly developed conjugated polymer poly(2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)) (PCPDTBT),26 much progress has been made in mesoscopic structured Sb2S3 sensitized solar cells. Studies on the optimization of device configuration and the deposition of Sb2S3 have also been reported to promote the development of Sb2S3 sensitized solar cells.27–33
However, all of those Sb2S3 sensitized solar cells reported in previous work need a dense TiO2 blocking layer and a mesoscopic TiO2 scaffold, both of which require high-temperature sintering processes. And most of the studies have focused on the hole conductor materials for Sb2S3 sensitized solar cells. The complex geometry may also cause limited open circuit voltage because charge recombination can easily happen at the uncovered surface if the absorber is not evenly distributed throughout the mesoscopic structure. Considering this, a planar type Sb2S3 device would be more competitive because it is conceptually simpler and it has additional advantages of lower cost and higher open circuit voltages due to reduced charge carrier recombination. To the best of our knowledge, studies on planar Sb2S3 heterojunction solar cells and new efficient low-temperature processed electron conductor (EC) materials have been seldom investigated so far and the efficiencies based on planar CBD-Sb2S3 devices were about 0.8–2.17% at this stage.28,34,35 Therefore, it is highly desirable for a potential industrial-scale process to develop an approach toward easy-fabrication, low-cost and high-efficiency planar Sb2S3 solar cells. Tin oxide (SnO2) is a wide band-gap metal oxide semiconductor which has drawn much attention because of its unique high intrinsic carrier mobility and excellent transparency at visible wavelengths.36,37 The mobilities of both single crystal SnO2 (μe > 250 cm2 V−1 s−1) and nanostructured SnO2 (μe ∼ 125 cm2 V−1 s−1) are orders of magnitude higher than single crystal TiO2 (μe < 1 cm2 V−1 s−1). Furthermore, SnO2 has a larger band-gap, which would show a low sensitivity to UV degradation and a better long-term stability.38,39
In this paper, we firstly introduce low-temperature solution-processed SnO2 into planar Sb2S3 thin film solar cells to substitute a high-temperature sintered dense blocking layer of TiO2. Planar Sb2S3 heterojunction solar cells have been made using chemical bath deposited Sb2S3 as the absorber, low-temperature solution-processed SnO2 as the electron conductor and P3HT as the hole conductor. A solar conversion efficiency of 2.8% was obtained at 1 sun illumination using a planar solar cell comprised of FTO/SnO2/Sb2S3/P3HT/Au, whereas the control device with a configuration of FTO/TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT/Au yielded an efficiency of 1.9%. This work provides an efficient planar solar cell based on a dense SnO2 electron conductor and a CBD Sb2S3 absorber. Our results also show the potentiality of planar Sb2S3 heterojunction solar cells as candidates to achieve robust, efficient and cheap photovoltaic devices.
2 Experimental details
2.1 Chemicals
All reagents including SbCl3, SnCl2·2H2O, acetone, ethanol and Na2S2O3·5H2O were bought from Aladdin, which were analytically pure. The polymer P3HT was bought from Rieke Metals. All the materials were used without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of SnO2 and Sb2S3
In a typical synthesis of SnO2, a precursor solution was prepared by dissolving SnCl2·2H2O in ethanol under 10 min of ultra-sonic agitation. The precursor solution can be spin-casted on different substrates and SnO2 films will form easily after annealing at 200 °C for 2 h in air.
In a typical synthesis of Sb2S3, a chemical bath solution was prepared by dissolving 650 mg of SbCl3 initially in 2.5 ml of acetone and subsequently adding 25 ml of 1 M Na2S2O3 solution and sufficient deionized (DI) water to make the volume to 100 ml. For the deposition of Sb2S3, clean substrates were placed vertically on the wall of the beaker in the bath. At the end of different durations of depositions, substrates coated with orange yellow films were taken out from the bath, washed well with DI water, and dried in an oven. A final film thickness of 150 nm was achieved in 2 h deposition inside a temperature-controlled refrigerator at 4 °C. This deposition condition was followed for most studies presented here. To form brown crystalline Sb2S3, the samples were annealed in an argon atmosphere at 300 °C for 10 min.
2.3 Fabrication of solar cells
Fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) coated glass with a sheet resistivity of 15 Ω sq−1 was used as the substrate. The substrates were firstly cleaned with aqueous detergent, and then were cleaned by ultra-sonic agitation in DI water, acetone and alcohol sequentially for 10 min each. Finally, the substrates were dried by N2 gas and put into a temperature-controlled drying oven for use. Then as-cleaned FTO substrates were UV-ozone treated for 15 min before deposition of SnO2. The SnO2 precursor solution was spin-cast on FTO at 500 rpm for 6 s and 2000 rpm for 40 s (thickness ca. 40 nm). Then the films were annealed at 200 °C for 2 h in air. After they cooled down to room temperature (RT), the FTO/SnO2 substrates were put into the bath for deposition of Sb2S3. Sb2S3 layers were then annealed at 300 °C for 10 min in an argon-filled glove box. The hole conductor solution was prepared by dissolving 20 mg of P3HT in 1 ml of chlorobenzene. The solution was heated to 40 °C with vigorous magnetic stirring for 24 h before use. Subsequently, the hole transporting layer was spin-coated from the solution onto Sb2S3 films at 500 rpm for 6 s and then 2000 rpm for 40 s (thickness ca. 100 nm). And then the samples were put into the evaporator immediately. Sequentially, a 200 nm Au top electrode was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask under a pressure of about 10−4 Pa. Finally, the fabricated devices were thermally annealed on a hot plate at 90 °C for 30 min in an argon-filled glove box to form planar Sb2S3 heterojunction solar cells. The active area of our device is 0.09 cm2 defined by our shadow mask.
2.4 Materials and device characterization
The crystal structure of the Sb2S3 films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Conventional XRD in Bragg–Brentano configuration has been performed using the same Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA. Line traces were collected over 2θ values ranging from 10° to 60°. The transmittance of the films was measured using a UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (CARY5000, Varian) in the 300–800 nm wavelength range at RT. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurement was made using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI XL-30) equipped with an X-ray analyzer and an EDS spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were performed using a XPS/UPS system (Thermo Scientific, ESCLAB 250Xi, USA). The compositions and chemical states of SnO2 films were examined by XPS. Before being tested, samples were sputter-cleaned by the lower energy of Ar+ to remove atmospheric contamination in the XPS chamber for approximately 30 s, and the Ar+ gun was operated at 0.5 kV at a pressure of 1 × 10−7 Pa. The vacuum pressure of the analysis chamber was better than 1 × 10−8 Pa. The whole survey scan to identify the overall surface composition and chemical states was performed, using a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source (=1486.68 eV), detecting photoelectrons at a 150 eV pass energy and a channel width of 500 meV. The surface carbon signal at 284.6 eV was used as an internal standard. The work functions and band energy positions were calculated by UPS. UPS was carried out using Helium Iα radiation from a discharge lamp operated at 90 W, a pass energy of 10 eV, and a channel width of 25 meV. A −9 V bias was applied to the samples in order to separate the sample and analyze low-kinetic-energy cutoffs. The carrier density and electron mobility of SnO2 films were measured using a Hall effect measurement system (Lake Shore 7704A). The morphologies of different electron conductor layers spin-cast on top of FTO were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM, SPM-9500J3, Shimadzu, Japan). The photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out under a 488 nm laser at RT and the emission was collected via a HORIBA Jobin-Yvon monochromator. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were obtained using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit and the device test was carried out under an illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 (the light intensity was calibrated using a Si photodiode) at RT using a solar simulator. The corresponding incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured using a QE/IPCE measurement system (Enli Technology Co. Ltd).
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Deposition and characterization of Sb2S3
Antimony sulfide was fabricated by a CBD method. We first studied the growth of Sb2S3 before it can be used as an absorber for solar cells. The deposition rate was affected by the temperature of the solution and the time of growth. The synthesis of Sb2S3 by the CBD method for our study involves the chemical reaction equations:2SbCl3 + 3Na2S2O3 → Sb2(S2O3)3 + 6NaClSb2(S2O3)3 + 6H2O → Sb2S3 + 3HSO4− + 3H3O+
To avoid immediate precipitation and to enable a strong adhesion of Sb2S3 to our substrates, on one hand, the reactions have to be slowed down by cooling the reaction solution. On the other hand, the substrates have to be placed vertically in the bath and the side which we need a layer of uniform, smooth and adherent Sb2S3 film should face the wall of the beaker. In our study, the temperature was settled at 4 °C and the optimal growth time of Sb2S3 was controlled at 2 h.

Fig. 1a shows the optical transparency and the absorption spectra of Sb2S3 films on FTO substrates. The blue line represents the absorption spectrum while the black line refers to the transmission spectrum. The inset shows the enlarged part of the absorption spectrum of Sb2S3 films in the range of 500–800 nm. We can conclude that Sb2S3 can nearly absorb the whole visible light. Our Sb2S3 films showed an absorption onset at approximately 725 nm. The band-gap of Sb2S3 is 1.6–1.8 eV reported in literature studies,23,25 which is in good agreement with our study here. The typical XRD pattern of the Sb2S3 powder prepared by collecting the precipitate of the bath and then annealing in an argon atmosphere at 300 °C for 10 min is shown in Fig. 1b. The diffraction peaks are all assigned to the planes of the Sb2S3 materials. It was observed that Sb2S3 nanocrystal thin films have an orthorhombic Sb2S3 structure (JCPDS: 06-0474, shown in Fig. 1b), and no peaks of any other phases are detected in the pattern. This fact confirms that all films prepared on FTO samples are crystalline stibnite Sb2S3. The inset of Fig. 1b shows the schematic diagram of the CBD progress in our study. Side A represents the conducting side of our substrates. The elemental analysis of Sb2S3 is shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† which proved that the atomic ratio of elemental antimony and sulphur is approximately 2:3.

3.2 Study of low-temperature solution-processed SnO2
SnO2 is a wide band-gap metal oxide that has been used for gas sensing with high sensitivity and reversibility under ambient conditions. TiO2-coated multilayered SnO2 hollow microspheres have also exhibited improved photon conversion efficiency when used as photoanodes for DSSCs.40 However, up to now, there has been no report on the application of SnO2 in Sb2S3 sensitized solar cells. Considering its wider band-gap and higher electron mobility than TiO2, we proved that SnO2 can be a good candidate as an efficient electron conductor and antireflection layer for planar Sb2S3 heterojunction solar cells. In our work, SnO2 was synthesized by a facile solution approach. We used ethanol as the solvent to avoid precipitation caused by the hydrolysis of SnCl2. The reaction mechanism during the annealing of the precursor was proposed by us, which was described as:2SnCl2 + O2 + 2H2O = 2SnO2 + 4HCl↑To investigate the basic properties of SnO2 individually, we prepared SnO2 films on silicon substrates for XPS characterization. The results are presented in Fig. 2. The full XPS spectrum survey given in Fig. 2a shows the presence of O and Sn in SnO2 films. The scan of Sn 3d, O 1s and Cl 2p is shown in Fig. 2b–d, respectively. The binding energies of Sn 3d scan at 486.4 eV and 494.79 eV are attributed to Sn4+ 3d5/2 and Sn4+ 3d3/2, which proved that the Sn is tetravalent in the films. The peak at 530.1 eV of O 1s scan is assigned to O2− in SnO2 and the peak at higher binding energy belongs to chemisorbed oxygen atoms, hydroxide or oxy-hydroxide groups.41 No Cl was detected in the film according to the figure. These results are in good agreement with the reaction mechanism we proposed above. We also prepared SnO2 films on bare glass substrates for Hall effect measurements. Solution-processed SnO2 films possess an electron mobility of 100.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a carrier density of 9 × 1012 cm−3, which showed very promising electron transporting properties.

3.3 Study of simple and novel planar Sb2S3 solar cells
Sb2S3 has been proved to be an efficient absorber for sensitized solar cells based on mesoporous TiO2. Here planar Sb2S3 heterojunction solar cells based on a low-temperature solution-processed SnO2 EC have been realized. The implementation of planar Sb2S3 heterojunction solar cells with our architecture has offered a new opportunity toward high-efficiency, low-cost, easy-fabrication solar cells. We fabricated Sb2S3 planar heterojunction solar cells with an architecture of FTO/SnO2 EC/Sb2S3/P3HT HC/Au, as shown in Fig. 3a. The energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 3b. The energy level of SnO2 was achieved by our UPS and optical band-gap studies.

In order to check whether SnO2 can work efficiently, we fabricated Sb2S3 solar cells based on SnO2 films with various thicknesses, which were prepared by carefully controlling the SnCl2·2H2O concentrations. Dense TiO2 blocking layers were used for comparison. Firstly, we investigated the optical transmittance of different substrates for solar cells. As presented in Fig. 4a, an as-cleaned FTO substrate shows an average transmittance of 80% in the visible range. After sintering a dense TiO2 layer on FTO, the transparency decreased obviously. Surprisingly, all FTO/SnO2 samples became more transparent from 330 nm to 800 nm, which showed an antireflection effect. This is an encouraging result since high transparency of electrodes is vital for photovoltaic devices. For direct band-gap semiconductors, we can confirm the optical band-gap (Eg) of SnO2 according to the dependence of (αhν)2 on hν. For indirect band-gap semiconductors, we confirm the Eg of TiO2 according to the dependence of (αhν)1/2 on hν. The variation of (αhν)2 or (αhν)1/2versus hν calculated from Fig. 4a is shown in Fig. 4b, and Eg has been evaluated by extending the linear portion of the plots to the binding energy axis. The results proved that our solution-processed SnO2 has an Eg of 3.59 eV, which is higher than TiO2 (3.34 eV). Fig. 4c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of CBD devices and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the planar cells are summarized in Table 1. The performance statistics of these devices are shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† The optimum deposition time for Sb2S3 and concentration for P3HT were fixed at 2 h and 20 mg ml−1, respectively. As we can see, planar heterojunction solar cells with an architecture of FTO/dense TiO2 EC/Sb2S3/P3HT HC/Au showed a VOC of 0.498 V, a JSC of 8.42 mA cm−2, a FF of 38.13% and an overall PCE of 1.60%. It is noted that enhanced efficiency can be realized by using SnO2 as an electron conductor. By optimizing the concentration of SnO2 precursor solution, the devices yielded a VOC of 0.583 V, a JSC of 10.51 mA cm−2, a FF of 40.59% and an overall PCE of 2.49%. In order to achieve a perfect electron conductor to transport extracted electrons, the thickness must be controlled precisely. Here, 0.05 M processed SnO2 is too thin to form a smooth and continuous film to work efficiently. It is likely to cause a direct contact between FTO and Sb2S3 where leakage or recombination may easily happen. While 0.3 M processed SnO2 is too thick for transporting electrons because thicker SnO2 would cause an increased series resistance, which is not beneficial for the extraction of electrons. Therefore both the JSC and FF of devices based on 0.3 M processed SnO2 were lower than the 0.1 M processed SnO2 devices. It is noted that SnO2 devices present superior performances in all the parameters of solar cells than TiO2. The transmission spectra can give an explanation with respect to the improvement of the JSC of SnO2 devices. To further understand the performance of Sb2S3 solar cells, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the corresponding solar cells are tested and compared. Fig. 4d exhibits the IPCE spectra of the SnO2 device and TiO2 device. From Fig. 4d we can conclude that Sb2S3 mainly responds to light in the visible range and the average IPCE value of ∼60% is reached in the range of 400–500 nm. Devices with SnO2 show a slightly higher response in the range of 320 nm to 700 nm than TiO2 devices, resulting in a higher JSC under AM 1.5G illumination. IPCE results indicated the enhancement of the output current of devices using SnO2 EC, which is consistent with the performance of planar Sb2S3 solar cells. To confirm the reproducibility of solar cell devices, an additional histogram of PCE for 30 independently fabricated cell samples based on SnO2 EC and TiO2 EC, which contributed to the current study, is presented in the inset of Fig. 4d. The PCE histogram indicates that planar Sb2S3 solar cells based on SnO2 EC show higher PCE compared with solar cells based on TiO2 EC.

In addition to the thickness of SnO2, we observed that the HC concentration was another critical factor for device performance. Fig. 5a and Table 2 show the influence of HC concentration on the performance of the device based on the SnO2 EC. In these devices, the concentration of SnO2 precursor solution was fixed at 0.1M and the concentration of P3HT in 1 ml of chlorobenzene varied. As the HC concentration increased, the VOC increased, suggesting that thicker HC may act as an effective barrier for the back-flow of photoinduced electrons. By contrast, the JSC decreased at a higher concentration of 25 mg ml−1, probably caused by the higher resistance of thick HC. The results revealed the optimal HC concentration for higher device performance. By carefully controlling the interfaces of the devices and the film qualities, we achieved best-performing solar cells based on SnO2 EC and P3HT HC with an efficiency of 2.8%, a VOC of 0.585 V, a JSC of 10.57 mA cm−2 and a FF of 45.24%, whereas the best-performing solar cells based on TiO2 EC show an efficiency of 1.9% with a VOC of 0.50 V, a JSC of 8.94 mA cm−2 and a FF of 42%. The corresponding J–V curves and parameters are presented in Fig. 5b and Table 3. We believe that our solution-processed SnO2 provides a superior EC for highly-efficient, easily-fabricated and low-cost solar cells based on CBD Sb2S3.

We noted that SnO2 devices output a higher VOC than TiO2 devices. To understand this phenomenon, we confirmed the energy levels of SnO2 EC and TiO2 EC and the tested results of UPS are shown in Fig. 6a and b. Helium Iα is used as the ultraviolet source. The wavelength of the ultraviolet is 58.13 nm and the energy is 21.22 eV. The work function was calculated using the equation EF = 21.22 − EB, where EF is the Fermi level and EB is the high binding energy cutoff. The valence band maximum (EVBM) with respect to the vacuum level can be achieved by calculating the low binding energy onset. The position of conduction band minimum (ECBM) was determined by adding the optical band-gap. The work functions of SnO2 and TiO2 are 5.17 eV and 4.94 eV, respectively. The differences between EF and EVBM are 2.72 eV and 2.5 eV for SnO2 and TiO2, respectively. Thus we got the energy levels of SnO2 and TiO2. The energy level position of Sb2S3 was obtained from the literature.42 We can conclude that SnO2 is more efficient in blocking holes because of its lower EVBM than TiO2. We also noticed that the ECBM of SnO2 is 4.3 eV, which is 0.2 eV more negative than TiO2. The ECBM of SnO2 is approximately 4.5 eV reported in literature studies.39,43 The minor difference between our results and literature reports may be caused by different processing temperatures of SnO2. So the energy offset between the ECBM of Sb2S3 and the ECBM of SnO2 is larger, suggesting that the photogenerated electron injection from the Sb2S3 to SnO2 would be faster than the TiO2 counterpart. Apart from this, the significant higher electron mobility of SnO2 would facilitate the extraction and transportation of photogenerated electrons effectively from the absorber to the collecting electrodes. So, recombination at the interface between SnO2 and Sb2S3 may be suppressed, which is beneficial for achieving a higher VOC. Our PL study below can further prove this conclusion. What is more, the higher transparency and wider incident light wavelength range of SnO2 can also make a contribution to the enhancement of device photovoltage output.

(c) Plots of dV/dJ vs. (Jsc − J)−1 and the linear fitting curves calculated from the dark J–V curves of TiO2 and SnO2 devices. (d) Steady state PL spectra of the FTO/Sb2S3/P3HT, FTO/TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT and FTO/SnO2/Sb2S3/P3HT samples. 
As illustrated above, we noticed an obvious enhancement of photocurrent for SnO2 devices. Except for the wider band-gap and antireflection effects, we also found other important characteristics for SnO2-based devices. For our planar Sb2S3 heterojunction solar cells, a diode model can be used to analyze the J–V curve, from which we can get the series resistance (Rs) according to the linear fit of the data.  where A is the ideality factor of the heterojunction, KB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and e is the elementary charge. Fig. 6c gives the plots of dV/dJ vs. (Jsc − J)−1 with fit used to determine the Rs of the devices in the dark. As we can see, the Rs of the device based on TiO2 is 15.44 Ω cm−2 and it decreased to 2.82 Ω cm−2 for SnO2 devices. As we know, for solar cells, a smaller Rs is very important for achieving a higher current output. In order to investigate the interface transporting properties and charge carrier recombination losses of the devices, we carried out steady state photoluminescence (PL) measurements. Fig. 6d shows the PL spectra of FTO/Sb2S3/P3HT, FTO/TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT and FTO/SnO2/Sb2S3/P3HT. The only difference in the samples is the electron conductor. The FTO/Sb2S3/P3HT sample (referred to as no EC in the figure) has the highest PL intensity, indicating that serious recombination happens in the Sb2S3 films or at the interface. When ECs were introduced into the samples, the PL intensities became weaker, suggesting that charge transfer occurred effectively before the carrier recombination in the Sb2S3 films or at the interface. The SnO2-based samples show even weaker PL intensity than TiO2-based samples, indicating that SnO2 is more efficient in suppressing carrier recombination and transferring charges than TiO2. This conclusion can also explain the voltage and current enhancement of SnO2 devices. Since P3HT is also an absorber used in organic solar cells, we then studied whether P3HT contributed to the photocurrent of our devices by fabricating devices with an architecture of FTO/SnO2/P3HT/Au. The tested photovoltaic results are presented in Fig. S3 in the ESI,† which proved that P3HT acted as the HC and no photocurrent contribution was caused by P3HT. Our conclusions about P3HT are consistent with the literature report.44
For planar Sb2S3 heterojunction solar cells, the morphologies of substrates also have an important influence on the device performance. A smooth interface is essential for achieving a higher FF for planar devices. We studied the interface between the absorber and the EC. Fig. 7 presents the AFM images of FTO, FTO/TiO2 and FTO/SnO2, respectively. The scan scale is 2 μm × 2 μm. The root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of as-cleaned FTO was 17.5 nm and it decreased to 4.08 nm after the sintering of TiO2 EC. FTO/SnO2 samples possessed the smooth surface with a RMS value of 1.87 nm. This smooth surface was very helpful to reduce the recombination of light induced excitations at the interface of the absorber and electron conductor, which would be beneficial for the enhancement of cell performance.

4 Conclusion
In summary, we have fabricated efficient planar Sb2S3 heterojunction solar cells with a novel architecture of FTO/SnO2 EC/Sb2S3/P3HT/Au and proved that low-temperature solution-processed SnO2 has superior properties compared to high-temperature sintered TiO2 as an electron conductor. The SnO2 film with an antireflection effect has a wider optical band-gap, a higher electron mobility, and a smoother morphology, which are beneficial for effective charge transfer across the device and finally yielding a higher photocurrent. Moreover, suppressed recombination at the interface between SnO2 and Sb2S3 can cause an increase of open circuit voltage owing to a smaller energy loss. Finally, a solar conversion efficiency of 2.8% was achieved by using a simple chemical-bath-deposited Sb2S3 as the absorber and SnO2 films as the electron conductor. Our work provides a kind of simple, novel and efficient planar Sb2S3 heterojunction solar cell. Our work also offers an outstanding electron conductor for Sb2S3 heterojunction solar cells.
