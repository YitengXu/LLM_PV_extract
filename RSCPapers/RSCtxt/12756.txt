    , Accepted 5th February 2011First published on 28th February 2011AbstractCd1−xZnxS solid solution with nano-twin structures are synthesized and exhibit superior photocatalytic activities for H2 evolution from water under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 430 nm) without noble metal co-catalysts. Such Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanocrystals show the highest activity for hydrogen evolution with an extremely high apparent quantum yield (AQY = 43%) at 425 nm, achieving a hydrogen evolution rate of 1.79 mmol h−1 without noble metals. The hydrogen evolution rate of 1.70 mmol h−1 was achieved under simulated sunlight conditions (without infrared light). The “back to back” potential formed by parallel nano-twins in the Cd1−xZnxS crystals can significantly improve the separation of the photo-generated electrons/holes (preventing their recombination) thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Photodeposition experiments of noble metals strongly support such a mechanism. It is found that noble metals were selectively photo-deposited at central regions between the twin boundaries. The concentration of free electrons at the central region of twins was markedly higher and the twins can effectively separate the H2 evolution sites (electrons) from oxidation reaction sites (holes).

Broader context
Photocatalytic hydrogen production from water by solar irradiation is one of the most promising ways to solve the world energy and environmental crisis. Since lots of researchers have devoted themselves to it, the technique has been significantly developed. However it is still far away to put it into practical application, due to the high cost and unmet energy conversion efficiency (ECE). Researchers are trying to find a semiconductor with highly photocatalytic activity while of low cost, which means noble metal element free. In this report, we synthesized a nano-twin Cd1−xZnxS semiconductor, aiming at achieving high ECE but low cost. Results show that the activity for hydrogen evolution on such nano-twins was extremely high, with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 43% at 425 nm and a hydrogen evolution rate of 1.79 mmol h−1 without any co-catalyst. Thus, we present a novel method by synthesis of nano-twin semiconductors to make an approach for its practical application.

Introduction

        Hydrogen is widely accepted as a future clean energy carrier to address the challenges of environmental pollution, climate change and high oil prices. However, production of hydrogen from renewable resources instead of fossil fuels is a critical technological challenge. Honda and Fujishima1 presented the concept of photoelectrochemically splitting water into H2 and O2, which offered a possibility for converting solar energy to chemical energy and/or electrical energy by using H2 as a medium.2–5 However, the low efficiency and high cost of hydrogen production by photocatalysis limit its practical applications. In the past few decades, great efforts have been devoted to developing strategies and designing new photocatalytic materials for improving the efficiency, but there is still a long way to go.6–11
Photocatalytic activity is strongly dependent on the transport and separation efficiencies of photo-generated electrons and holes in the photocatalysts. However, free charge carriers (free electrons and holes) can be trapped or scattered by various kinds of random defects (grain boundaries, dislocations, point defects et. al), resulting in increasing recombination probability.12–14 Even in single crystals (free of defects), the recombination of free charge carriers is highly possible for their non-directional and long-distance migration (usually by diffusion). Electrostatic field can be introduced by microstructure modification, such as heterojunction and surface phase junction,15,16 which will promote the separation of these free charges. However, these junctions will hinder the transport capability of free charges.13 Therefore, it is highly desirable to refine the microstructure of semiconductor photocatalysts, aiming not only to promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, but also to facilitate their transport pathway.
Nano-twin structures can be obtained by various ways such as plastic deformation, phase transformation, and other physical and chemical methods.17–21 The excellent electrical properties of crystals with nano-twin structures have been confirmed.22,23 The electrical resistivity of coherent twin boundaries is nearly one order of magnitude lower than that of the crystals with conventional high-angle grain boundaries as observed in both conductors and semiconductors.19,24 It is expected that the twins inside a photocatalyst can not only keep the transport property of free charges as in perfect crystals (due to its highly ordered structures), but also prevent the re-combination of holes and electrons (due to the possibility of forming electrostatic field). Therefore, the photocatalytic activity should be significantly improved if nano-twins can be introduced into photocatalytic semiconductors.
Here we report the preparation of Cd1−xZnxS solid solution with nano-twins by a novel precipitate-hydrothermal method (denoted as Cd1−xZnxS-PH). We confirmed that the twins in semiconductors not only suppressed the random scattering of the electrons/holes but also provided potential field to prevent the re-combination of the free charges. The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production from aqueous solution under visible light over the twin-modified Cd1−xZnxS photocatalyst is significantly enhanced without co-catalyst of noble element such as Pt. The efficiency of electrons/holes separation on the nano-twin crystals is about 5 times of that in non-twin crystals in the as-prepared photocatalysts. Although it is well documented that the effect of nano-twins on the mechanical properties,18,25–29 no reports associated with the effects of nano-twins on the photocatalytic activity have been published.
Experimental
Preparation of photocatalysts
(1) Preparation of Nano-Cd1−xZnxS photocatalysts by precipitate-hydrothermal method: NaOH aqueous solution (4 M, 10 mL) were spilled into a aqueous solution (40 mL) containing stoichiometric Cd(Ac)2·2H2O and Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (n(Cd)+n(Zn)=0.02 mol), then thioacetamide (0.025 mol) were added into the previous solution containing the mixture of Cd(OH)2 and Zn(OH)2. All chemicals were in analytical grade. The whole process was carried out under magnetic stirring. The reacted mixture was further stirred for 20 min, and then sealed in a 60 mL capacity Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and was heated to 180 °C for 24 h. After cooling, the product was separated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and dried at 80 °C for 5 h in a vacuum oven. Cd1−xZnxS solid solution prepared by this method is denoted as Cd1−xZnxS-PH.
(2) Cd0.5Zn0.5S prepared by hydrothermal method:33thioacetamide (0.025 mol) was added to an aqueous solution (40 mL) containing stoichiometric Cd(Ac)2·2H2O and Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (n(Cd)+n(Zn)=0.02 mol). The whole process was carried out under magnetic stirring. The mixture was further stirred for 20 min, and then sealed in a 60mL capacity Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and was heated to 180 °C for 24 h. After cooling, the product was separated by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and dried at 80 °C for 5 h in a vacuum oven. Cd0.5Zn0.5S prepared by this method is denoted as Cd0.5Zn0.5S–H.
(3) Cd0.5Zn0.5S prepared by precipitation method:31,32 Na2S aqueous solution (0.5M, 40 mL) was added to an aqueous solution (40 mL) containing stoichiometric Cd(Ac)2·2H2O and Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (n(Cd)+n(Zn)=0.02 mol), followed by continuously stirring for 24 h at room temperature. Then, the product was filtered and washed with deionized water several times, and dried at 80 °C for 5 h in a vacuum oven. Cd0.5Zn0.5S prepared by this method is denoted as Cd0.5Zn0.5S–C.
(4) Cd0.5Zn0.5S prepared by thermal sulfuration:32 An appropriate amount of Cd(Ac)2·2H2O and Zn(Ac)2·2H2O were dissolved in deionized water. Solid mixture which was obtained by vaporizing was heated in a quartz tube at 400 °C for 2 h under air flow to decompose. A homogeneous mixture of CdO and ZnO was obtained. Dry H2S gas was then passed through the quartz tube at 450 °C for 4 h to sulfurize CdO and ZnO. After being cooled naturally to 100 °C with H2S gas flow, the product was milled and collected. Cd0.5Zn0.5S prepared by this method is denoted as Cd0.5Zn0.5S–S.
Characterization of photocatalysts

          X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of prepared photocatalysts were confirmed by an X'Pert PRO diffractometer using Cu Ka (λ = 0.1538 nm) irradiation with constant instrument parameter. And all the samples were scanned between 10° and 90° with a step size of 0.033° 2θ.
BET surface areas were determined by a Beckman Coulter SA3100 instrument, which was applying the BET method to the N2 absorption isotherms measured at liquid nitrogen temperature. The samples were previously outgassed at 393 K for 180 min.

          Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectra were measured on a Hitachi U-4100 spectrometer, equipped with a lab-sphere diffuse reflectance accessory. The absorption edges border (λ0) was cursorily determined by a node which was obtained by plotting two tangents line over the slope and the approximate horizon on the bottom of the Uv-vis.
The crystallite morphologic micrographs were observed by JEOL JSM-6700F field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) JEM-3010 and transmission electron microscope FEI Tecnai F30.
Elemental mapping over the selected regions of the photocatalytst was conducted by an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) attached to TEM FEI Tecnai F30.
The elemental analysis was completed on a Bruker S4 PIONEER X-ray fluorescence spectrum (XRF), using Rh target and 4 KW power. The chemical forms of the products were studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) AXIS Ultra DLD, Shimadzu/Kratos Analytical, Japan) with monochromatic Al Kαa radiation (1486.6 eV). Electronic states were investigated by electron spin resonance (ESR; Bruker EMX-10/12 with a N2-temperature controller).
Photocatalytic reactions
Photocatalytic reactions of hydrogen production from water were conducted in a gas-closed system with a side irradiation Pyrex cell (using PLS-SXE300/300UV Xe lemp irradiation) and a top irradiation Pyrex cell (using direct solar irradiation). The photocatalyst powder was dispersed by a magnetic stirrer in an aqueous (180 mL) containing Na2S (0.35 M) and Na2SO3 (0.25 M) as electron donors. The photocatalysts were irradiated with visible light (λ ≥ 430 nm) through a cutoff filter from the Xe lamp, and with direct solar irradiation (300–760 nm, the infrared radiation was filtered by water). The intensity and number of photons of the two light sources were measured by a fiber optic spectrometer. The amount of H2 gas was determined using online thermal conductivity detector (TCD) gas chromatography (NaX zeolite column, TCD detector, N2carrier) or drainage. Apparent quantum yields (AQY) defined by eqn (1) were measured using a 425 nm band pass filters and an irradiate-meter. The energy conversion efficiency under direct solar irradiation (300–760 nm) was determined by eqn (2) where △G (J mol−1) is the standard Gibbs energy for the chemical reaction forming the product(s) P, RP (mol s−1) is the rate at which the products are formed, Es is the total incoming light irradiance (J s−1m−2), and A is the irradiated area. (1) (2)
Results and discussion
Microstructure and property characterization
The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH solid solution are shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen that regular strip-like structures existed on the surface of the particles as marked in Fig. 1(a). The strips were clarified to be nano-twins of the {111}/[112] by the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) as shown in Fig. 1(b), and by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern and a magnification of the coherent twin boundaries (insets in Fig. 1b). The formation mechanism of nano twins is not fully understood now, which is our recent research focus. The nano-twins containing Cd1−xZnxS solid solution showed extremely high activities for hydrogen production under visible light from Xe lamp or direct solar irradiation. As shown in Figure S1, the rate and time course of H2 evolution over Cd1−xZnxS-PH solid solution under visible light from Xe lamp had been measured. Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH shows the highest activity, probably due to a balance of conduction band level and light absorbability30 of the semi-conductor. The hydrogen production rate reached to 1.79 mmol h−1 (average rate in the initial 5 h), which is much higher than results reported to data in the literatures,30–34 with the apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 43% at 425 nm. Photocatalytic H2 evolution over other Cd0.5Zn0.5S photocatalysts (Cd0.5Zn0.5S–H, Cd0.5Zn0.5S–C and Cd0.5Zn0.5S–S) was also measured. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. S2,† Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH exhibited much higher photoactivity for hydrogen production compared to other Cd0.5Zn0.5S photocatalysts, possibly attributed to the nano-twin structures. It is also shown that this catalyst exhibited very high photocatalytic stability (Figure S1e), as well as the structural stability (Fig. S1h and S1i†). More importantly, hydrogen production over the as-prepared Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH photocatalyst under direct solar irradiation (with infrared light filtered by water) is very high (1.70 mmol h−1 without noble metals as co-catalyst). The energy conversion efficiency (ECE) is as high as ∼6.0% (light intensity: 37 mW cm−2, irradiation area: 50.24 cm2).

Mechanism
In order to elucidate the effects of nano-twins to the photocatalytic activity, we measured both specific surface area and crystal phase of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH and other Cd0.5Zn0.5S materials (Fig. S3†). It is apparent that, by comparing these reported results 30–34 and our present work, we can hardly attribute the extremely high activity of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH simply to the differences in crystal phase and surface area. Interestingly, nano-twin structures were only observed in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH crystals. We believe that Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH crystals with nano-twins significantly increase the photocatalytic activity, in mechanism as elucidated as follows:
1) Schottky barrier model.24 Schottky barrier model is regarded as a basic model of potential barrier formation at gain boundaries.35 The concept of charge trapping at interfaces of grain boundaries in semiconductors was postulated since the first report of a germanium bicrystal.36 Defects, such as dislocations, at interfaces are proposed as the origin of interface states in the bandgap that pin the Fermi level.37 The difference of Fermi level between the grains and the boundaries drives the migration of electrons, forming a band-bending and “back to back” Schottky barrier.35 It can be also assumed as an electric field. The impacting range by this barrier at the boundary is called “depletion layer”. The height of the potential developed at any particular interface depends on the density and position of the interface states in the bandgap. The potential is usually going to resist majority carriers and attract minority carrier.35 And in n-type semiconductors, such as Cd1−xZnxS, the band-bending is upward, resulting in the resistance of electrons (majority carriers) and attraction of holes (minority carriers) as shown in Scheme S1.†
2) Free of random defects with the presence of nano-twins. Random defects are generally regarded as trapping and recombination centres for photogenerated electrons and holes because of their high and disordered potential barrier with a wide depletion layer.35, 38–40 Minority carriers are attracted to the boundary, resulting in the re-combination with majority carriers (unless they can easily escape from the potential, they will be separated from carriers). This was also confirmed by EBIC (electron-beam-introduced current) techniques which are widely used to directly observe the re-combination of carriers at grain boundaries in physics.41,42 Moreover, random defects, which were usually non-coincidence site lattice (CSL) with high ∑ values,24,43–45 where ∑ is the reciprocal density of coincidence sites, increased the scattering of free electrons.14,22 This will result in the increment of recombination possibility of the electrons and holes. Accordingly, the elimination of random defects will enhance the photocatalytic activity.
3) Facilitated transport of free electrons and holes through coherent twin boundaries. As shown in Scheme 1(a), it is confirmed that the electrons can migrate through twin boundaries (only a single atom layer) usually by the wave mechanical tunnel effect without any remarkable resistance due to the much lower boundary energy and potential barrier along with a very narrow depletion layer.,23,35,46,47 Furthermore, the scattering of free electrons on the twin boundaries can be negligible for their low ∑ value (∑ = 3), which corresponds to very high CSL.24, 43–45 Hence the photogenerated electrons are highly prone to reach the surface of the photocatalysts to react with H+. Simultaneously, the minority carriers (hole for n-type semiconductors here) can easily escape from the attraction of twin boundary to react with the sacrificial reagent which facilitates the half reaction (oxidation reaction). Thus the whole photocatalytic reaction is accelerated.
 Scheme 1  The migration of free charges and photocatalytic hydrogen production from aqueous solution over nano-twin Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH crystals. a) Free charges pass though single atom layer boundaries without being trapped or scattered. b) Parallel boundaries provided twin-boundary-dependent potential which derived the “back to back” Schottky barrier and would control the migration of free charges. 
4) The formation of twin-boundary-dependent potential by the parallel coherent twin boundaries. It was very interesting to observe that the twin boundary itself is not a re-combination centre for free electrons/holes in Si,48 which was so different from normal boundaries. We hypothesize that the nano-twins played the similar role in the as-prepared Cd1−xZnxS-PH. Applying Schottky model on the nano-twins, the “back to back” potentials were established orderly at the parallel twin boundaries, as schematically shown in Scheme 1(b). Although direct calculations or experimental measurements of the potential of Cd1−xZnxS nano-twin boundaries are not available due to their too small size, it is reported that the potential of normal boundary in semiconductors is in the range of several meV to several hundred meV.49,50 The potential of a twin boundary should be much lower than that of a normal boundary, but should be sufficient to drive the migration of electron and hole pairs.
Theoretical and experimental validation
To further prove the effects of nano-twins on separation of the charges, the width of depletion layer was calculated based on a physical model (details in Supporting Information S1†). The half width of the depletion layer (ω) in nano-twins was estimated to be around 22 nm that is larger than the width of the coherent twin boundaries (∼10 nm). The depletion layer with a low potential will push the electrons (with negative charge) and attract the holes (with positive charge) as shown in Scheme 1(b). The ordered potentials, unlike that formed by random defects are favorable for this separation. Accordingly, the photogenerated electrons and holes will be efficiently separated by the potential formed within the range of the depletion layer. In other words, the electrons were shifted to the region between the twin boundaries to react with H+, while the holes were migrated to the twin boundary and then easily react with S2−. The effect of the holes on oxidation of organic agents may also contribute to the high hydrogen evolution rate. However, the details of this effect are still unclear and require future investigations. Efficient separation of the electrons and holes by the potential will hinder their recombination thus significantly increasing the photocatalytic activity.
To clarify the distribution of activated sites in the nano-twin crystals, we designed a photo-deposition experiment to produce metals from metal salts (reduction reaction). If the free electrons are aggregated in the region between the twin-boundaries as discussed above, more pure metals (high concentration) will be formed in this particular area as free electrons are necessary to activate the reaction to produce pure metals from metal salts. We selected (NH4)2RuCl6·6H2O and (NH4)2PtCl6·6H2O as example salts. Ru or Pt can be formed from (NH4)2RuCl6·6H2O or (NH4)2PtCl6·6H2O in the areas rich with free electrons.51–53 Therefore, the concentration of Ru/Pt could indicate the location of free electrons (activated sites).11,54 Our results clearly show that Ru concentration was much higher in crystals with nano-twins. TEM with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) determined the average Ru concentration of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH powders with twin and non-twin crystals in the selected area of Fig. S5† is 0.46 wt% that agreed very well with the bulk Ru concentration of 0.44 wt% measured by X-ray fluorescence spectrum. It is not surprising that the Ru concentration in crystals with nano-twins is much higher than that in non-twin crystals (0.76 wt% vs. 0.14 wt%, Fig. S5†). This strongly supports our hypothesis proposed in Scheme 1. We accordingly calculated that the fraction of twin crystals is ∼0.52 (in supporting information†), which means about half is non-twin crystals. More importantly, it can be clearly seen from Fig. 2 that Pt particles (also confirmed by XPS spectrum as shown in Fig. 3) commonly formed at the central region area between two twin boundaries, and there was few Pt formed at the twin boundaries. According to our hypothesis indicated in Scheme 1, the positive charge of holes will locate at the boundaries, but the free electrons will be repelled to the central area between the twin boundaries. Therefore, the Pt particles are mostly formed in the central region because free electrons are necessary for the reaction of (NH4)2PtCl6·6H2O to Pt. Clearly, our designed experiments confirmed the proposed mechanism of nano-twin enhanced photocatalytic activity by Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH solid solution photocatalyst.

The solid black and red curves are the smoothing original data and fitted data, respectively. The dashed lines are composite fits of Pd(II) and Pd (0). Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 intensity ratio was set to 4:3 and the Binding Energy difference was 3.3 eV. 
Besides the Pt experiments for determining the reactive sites (enrich area of free electrons), we performed an electron spin resonance (ESR) experiment to illustrate the life time of free electrons in the bulk materials. Photoinduced ESR spectrum is widely used in photocatalytic reaction for the photogenerated electrons and holes that trapped in materials.55–63 The stronger vibration peak from ESR spectrum indicates the longer life time of free electrons, which means that the recombination of electrons and holes has been prevented (compared to the materials with weaker vibration). The result is shown in Fig. 4, which confirmed the best prevention of the recombination and showed the highest reactivity among the four compared materials. It is not surprised that no signals were detected before light irradiated onto Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH. The intensity of the vibration of Cd0.5Zn0.5S–S is very weak, and is increased for Cd0.5Zn0.5S–C and Cd0.5Zn0.5S–P. The intensity of the vibration of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH is the highest. The peak indicates the bulk characterization of vibration of Cd+ that is formed from the trapping of one electron in Cd band, which devoted to the consequent reduction reaction for H+ to form H2. The intensity of photoinduced ESR signal is consistent with the photocatalytic activity mentioned above. According to the Pt reduction reaction and the ESR experiments, we believe that the twin defects in Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH can repel the photogenerated electrons to the central area between the twins (reactive sites) and enhance the separation of electrons and holes (longer life time of electrons). The unique twin structure thus prevents the recombination of electrons and holes and exhibits a very high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from water.

Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized a Cd1−xZnxS-PH solid solution photocatalyst with nano-twin structures that exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen generation from aqueous solution. The average rate of hydrogen evolution reached as high as 1.70 mmol h−1 and energy conversion efficiency of ∼6.0% obtained under sunlight. Besides the function of Zn concentration, the enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen generation is attributed to the formation of so-called twin-boundary-dependent potential that effectively separated the free electrons and the holes to prevent their recombination. The fraction of twin crystals in the synthesized Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH is only 52% meaning there is large room to further increase the fraction of twin crystals and significantly improve the rate of hydrogen production. Future research should be devoted to synthesis of high amount of twin crystals of Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH solid solution photocatalyst.

Broader context
Photocatalytic hydrogen production from water by solar irradiation is one of the most promising ways to solve the world energy and environmental crisis. Since lots of researchers have devoted themselves to it, the technique has been significantly developed. However it is still far away to put it into practical application, due to the high cost and unmet energy conversion efficiency (ECE). Researchers are trying to find a semiconductor with highly photocatalytic activity while of low cost, which means noble metal element free. In this report, we synthesized a nano-twin Cd1−xZnxS semiconductor, aiming at achieving high ECE but low cost. Results show that the activity for hydrogen evolution on such nano-twins was extremely high, with an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 43% at 425 nm and a hydrogen evolution rate of 1.79 mmol h−1 without any co-catalyst. Thus, we present a novel method by synthesis of nano-twin semiconductors to make an approach for its practical application.

 	Fig. 1  
            TEM images of the Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH solid solution. a) The unique nano-twin structures are marked in red circles. b) HRTEM image at the area of red circle shows the twin structure in a crystal; the insets are a FFT pattern indicating that the twins in each grain are parallel to each other in {111} planes; and a magnification of the twin structure confirming the parallel relationship of the twin boundaries.	 

 	Scheme 1  The migration of free charges and photocatalytic hydrogen production from aqueous solution over nano-twin Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH crystals. a) Free charges pass though single atom layer boundaries without being trapped or scattered. b) Parallel boundaries provided twin-boundary-dependent potential which derived the “back to back” Schottky barrier and would control the migration of free charges.

            TEM images of Pt loaded Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH solid solution.	 

 	Fig. 3  
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of Pt 4f in the Pt loaded Cd0.5Zn0.5S-PH catalyst collected after an irradiation with visible light (λ ≥ 430 nm) for 5 h in 0.25 M Na2SO3 and 0.35 M Na2S aqueous solutions. The solid black and red curves are the smoothing original data and fitted data, respectively. The dashed lines are composite fits of Pd(II) and Pd (0). Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 intensity ratio was set to 4:3 and the Binding Energy difference was 3.3 eV.	 

 	Fig. 4  Experimental ESR spectrum of various Cd0.5Zn0.5S photocatalysts (0.1 g photocatalyst for each powder was used for tests and each was irradiated by the same UV light for 10 min).
