    , Accepted 3rd June 2015First published on 5th June 2015AbstractMorphologically controlled micro-/nanostructures have gained considerable interest as they offer unique properties associated with size, shape, and crystallographic facets. In this paper, we report a simple yet rapid protocol for large scale synthesis of silver microplates (AgMPls) from a silver ammine complex ([Ag(NH3)2]+) under an etching environment containing O2/Cl−, NH4OH/H2O2, and H2O2 capable of dissolving silver crystals except plate structures. H2O2 is employed as the sole reducing agent. Chloride ions are essential for creating an etching environment capable of selective dissolution of singly and multiply twinned crystals, while leaving plate structures unaffected. Without chloride ions, H2O2 reduces the [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex to silver microparticles containing truncated cubes, icosahedra, pentagonal rods, and plate microstructures with icosahedra as the major product. The developed protocol enables environmentally friendly fabrication of highly pure AgMPls and AgMPs directly from the AgCl precipitate.
Introduction
In the past decade, morphology-controlled synthesis has become an important means for the fabrication of functional materials with desired properties as the nano-enable properties could be efficiently controlled through size and shape manipulation. The functional micro-/nanostructure of silver has attracted much attention as it offers potential applications in catalyst, electronic device, sensor, and medical device fabrications. Complex structures including nanocubes,1 nanoplates,2–4 nanorods,5 nanowires,6,7 and branched microcrystals8 were successfully synthesized. Reviews on the synthesis and characterization of silver nanoplates have recently been published.9–12 The plate like nanostructure with a large contact area has shown potential application in the fabrication of solar cells with high photocurrent.13
The morphology of silver micro-/nanostructures can be tuned through seed selection and growth processes.12,14,15 The morphology of seed particles is crucial for the structural controlled synthesis as it dictates the final products. The single crystal seed grows into a cube, octahedron, tetrahedron, and rectangular bar. The singly twinned seed grows into a right bipyramid and beam. The multiply twinned seed grows into a decahedron, icosahedron and pentagonal rod. The plate from seeds with stacking faults grows into a hexagonal and triangular plate. Oxidative etching has been employed for selective preservation or selective elimination of certain crystallographic structures. For example, Cl−/O2 dissolves singly and multiply twinned seeds,5,16–18 the halide ion etches Ag{110} facets,18 NH4OH/H2O2 etches single crystal seeds containing Ag{100} facets,19,20 while H2O2 etches all silver structures.21 Surface blocking was also practiced in shape-controlled synthesis. Several organic capping agents such as citrate, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) and inorganic capping agents such as halide ions, cyanide ions, and thiols were used for selective protection of certain facets while promoting growth on the non-protected facets.22–28
The efficient catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by silver metal was well-documented.29–31 The decomposition of H2O2 on silver metal at high concentration is extremely violent with releasing of intense heat, water vapor, and oxygen gas. H2O2 has been employed as an efficient etchant and a seed-selecting agent for the fabrication of silver nanostructures.21,32–34 Although H2O2 is well-known as a strong oxidizing agent, it is an efficient reducing agent under alkaline conditions.8,34–37 There are few reports exploiting the reducing capability of H2O2 for the fabrication of silver micro-/nanostructures. Silver nanosheets and 3D flowerlike silver microstructures were fabricated by H2O2 reduction of Ag+ and [Ag(NH3)2]+.8,36 Recently, direct synthesis of a silver microdisk on a plastic substrate by H2O2 reduction was demonstrated.37
This paper reveals a simple yet efficient approach for the production of silver microplates via H2O2 reduction of [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex under the influence of Cl−. For the first time, we demonstrated fabrication of silver microplates under an etching environment containing O2/Cl−, NH4OH/H2O2, and H2O2. Under such an environment, the survival of plate structures was promoted by chloride passivation of the dominated Ag{111} facets while truncated cubes, icosahedra, and pentagonal rods with Ag{100} envelopes were selectively destroyed. This method has several advantages including: (1) simplicity and rapidity as the reaction is completed within 1 h, (2) being operated under ambient conditions with a high concentration of silver ions, (3) employment of environmentally friendly reducing agents without using any capping agent or surfactant, and (4) ease separation of products. We also demonstrated direct preparation of AgMPs and AgMPls from wasted silver chloride precipitates using the developed protocol.
Experimental section
Chemicals
Silver nitrate (AgNO3, purity ≥ 99.8%), sodium chloride (NaCl, purity ≥ 99%), nitric acid (HNO3, 65% w/v), ammonium hydroxide solution (NH4OH, 25% w/w), and hydrogen peroxide solution (H2O2, 30% w/w) were purchased from Merck®. Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw ≈ 360000) was purchased from Aldrich. All chemicals were used as received. Deionized (DI) water was used as a solvent. Prior to use, all glassware and magnetic bars were thoroughly cleaned with detergent, rinsed with DI water, rinsed with 6 M nitric acid, and thoroughly rinsed again with DI water.
Reducing capability of H2O2
To demonstrate the reducing capability of H2O2 under alkaline conditions, silver microparticles (AgMPs) were synthesized from the colorless silver ammine complex ([Ag(NH3)2]+). Briefly, a clear solution of the [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex (pH ~10) was prepared by mixing AgNO3 solution (1 M, 1 mL) with an NH4OH (5.3 M, 1.7 mL) and PVP (5% w/v, 10 mL). The total volume was adjusted to 97.7 mL with DI water. As H2O2 (30% w/w, 2.3 mL) was added into the solution, the reduction of the complex to metallic silver could be noticed via the evolution of oxygen bubbles with an instant development of light brown silver colloid. The precipitated AgMPs were collected and cleaned with DI water. Under these conditions, the concentration of AgNO3, NH4OH, H2O2 and PVP were 0.01 M, 0.09 M, 0.22 M, and 0.5% w/v, respectively.
Synthesis of silver microplates (AgMPls)
AgMPls were selectively synthesized via the reduction of [Ag(NH3)2]+ with the presence of Cl− using H2O2 as a reducing agent. Briefly, a colloid of AgCl nanoparticles (AgClNPs) was prepared by a rapid injection of NaCl solution (0.1 M, 4 mL) into a solution of AgNO3 (1 M, 1 mL) and PVP (5% w/v, 10 mL) under vigorous stirring. A milky white colloid of AgClNPs spontaneously developed. The total volume was adjusted to 96 mL with DI water. The colloid was further stirred for 5 min before an addition of NH4OH solution (5.3 M, 1.7 mL). The colloid became less opaque due to partial dissolution of AgClNPs with formation of a water soluble [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex (eqn (1)). To induce the formation of AgMPls, H2O2 solution (30% w/w, 2.3 mL) was quickly injected into the colloid. The milky white colloid briefly turned light brown before turning into a sparkling glitter within 2 min due to the formation of AgMPls. The development of AgMPls and the progress of the reaction could be noticed by an evolution of oxygen bubbles (eqn (2)).38 The AgMPls glittered more intense as the reaction proceeded while AgClNPs disappeared. The colloid was further stirred for 1 h to ensure a complete reaction. The shiny silver precipitates were collected and washed 5 times with DI water. Under the standard conditions, the concentrations of NaCl, NH4OH, H2O2, AgNO3, and PVP were 0.004, 0.09, 0.22, 0.01 M, and 0.5% w/v, respectively. To investigate the influence of Cl−, NH4OH, H2O2, Ag+, and PVP on the morphology of AgMPs, their final concentrations were systematically manipulated within the range of 0–50 mM, 0–0.45 M, 0–0.88 M, 5–40 mM, and 0–2% w/v, respectively. AgCl + 2NH4OH ⇄ [Ag(NH3)2]+ + Cl− + 2H2O(1) 2[Ag(NH3)2]+ + H2O2 → 2Ag + 4NH3 + 2H2O + 1/2O2; E0cell = 0.227 V(2)
Structural investigation
Morphology (size and shape) of the AgMPs and AgMPls was recorded with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6510A) operating at 20 kV under a high vacuum mode with a secondary electron image (SEI) detector. A built-in energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) was employed to monitor elemental compositions of the AgMPls. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected by using an X-ray diffractometer (Philips PW3710) operated at room temperature with a scanning rate of 0.02° min−1, using Cu Kα irradiation (40 kV, 30 mA). The diffractograms were recorded in the 30°–80° region with a 0.2° resolution. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were performed using an AXIS ULTRA (Kratos Analytical, England) with Al Kα X-rays (1486.6 eV) as the exciting source. The charging calibration was performed by referring the C1s to the binding energy at 285 eV. The XPS data analysis was conducted with a standard ESCA-300 software package.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows an SEM micrograph of the silver microcrystals synthesized by the H2O2 reduction of [Ag(NH3)2]+ without Cl−. The microcrystals consisted of truncated cubes, icosahedra, pentagonal rods, hexagonal plates, and irregular particles. According to a detailed structural investigation (Fig. S1†), the irregular-shaped particles were, in fact, the under developed icosahedra. Based on a statistical analysis of 500 particles from non-overlapping SEM micrographs, the as-synthesized AgMPs consisted of 10.4% truncated cubes, 82.1% icosahedra and pentagonal rods, and 7.5% hexagonal plates (Fig. S2A†). The structural distribution confirmed that the multiply twinned crystals were the most thermodynamically favorable structures as they grow into icosahedra and pentagonal rods.5,14,39 The multiply twinned crystals are known to favorably develop at a high concentration of gold and silver ions.39 H2O2 is known to etch silver nanoparticles with selective preservation of Ag{111} facets.21 NH3, on the other hand, selectively passivates and prohibits etching of Ag{111} facets.6 As a result, crystals with dominated Ag{111} facets (i.e., icosahedra) could withstand the oxidative etching of H2O2 and NH4OH.
 Fig. 1  An SEM micrograph of AgMPs synthesized by H2O2 reduction of [Ag(NH3)2]+. The orange and green surfaces indicated {111} and {100} facets, respectively. The experimental conditions are [AgNO3] = 10 mM, [NH4OH] = 0.09 M, [H2O2] = 0.22 M, and [PVP] = 0.5% w/v. 
The isolated AgMPs also suggested that PVP plays an important role in facilitating particle growth as well as preventing aggregation. The well-separated particles with a uniform size of 3–4 μm suggest a non-overlapping nucleation and growth period enabled by sufficient PVP stabilization and NH3 surface passivation.6
Due to the positive electrochemical potentials in eqn (2), [Ag(NH3)2]+ can be reduced by H2O2.8,36,37 With the presence of NH4OH, [Ag(NH3)2]+ instantaneously forms due to the high complex formation constant of NH3 with Ag+ (Kf = 1.6 × 107).40 We hypothesized that [Ag(NH3)2]+ functioned as the silver supply for the formation of AgMPs. Under neutral conditions, H2O2 efficiently oxidizes silver nanospheres to Ag+.41 However, under alkaline conditions, H2O2 does not etch the newly generated seeds with stacking faults while the greater reduction potential compared to the oxidation potential favors the reduction.34 As a result, silver seeds with stacking faults survived and grew into micrometer size AgMPs even at a relatively high concentration of H2O2 (i.e., in Fig. 1, [H2O2]/[Ag+] = 22).
Selective formation of AgMPls
Since Cl− with dissolved O2 is known to selectively etch singly and multiply twinned seeds,5,16–18 the reduction of [Ag(NH3)2]+ by H2O2 under the influence of Cl− was conducted. The addition of Cl− was expected to work synergically with the in situ generated O2 from H2O2 decomposition as an efficient O2/Cl− etchant. Fig. 2 shows the structural evolution of AgMPs under the influence of Cl−. Surprisingly, even at a very low concentration of Cl− (0.05 mM, Fig. 2B), large icosahedra disappeared with a development of silver nanoplates (AgNPls). According to a statistical calculation of more than 500 particles from non-repeating SEM micrographs (Fig. S2†), the products consist of 2.5% small truncated cubes (with an average size of 1 μm), 76.4% small icosahedra (with an average size of 1 μm), and 21.1% microplates (with an average bisector length of 3 μm). When the concentration of Cl− ions was increased, the AgNPls became larger and thicker (with an average bisector length of 9 μm and average thickness of 300 nm). The truncated cubes and the icosahedra disappeared as the concentration of Cl− was increased to 4 mM (Fig. 2E, S2, and S3†). However, when the concentration of Cl− was greater than 10 mM, the AgMPls were not obtained since all [Ag(NH3)2]+ was precipitated as AgCl (Fig. 2H and I). The solid AgCl is non-soluble in the reaction media due to the low concentration of NH4OH. The H2O2 reduction of solid AgCl to metallic silver cannot be achieved unless more NH4OH is added in order to generate the water soluble [Ag(NH3)2]+. The AgMPls in Fig. 2E were highly pure silver (99.5%) as confirmed by EDS and XRD data (Fig. S4 and S5A†). According to EDS data, a trace amount of chloride indicated formation of a thin AgCl film on the basal planes.26–28 The thin AgCl film can be removed by washing with 0.1 M NH4OH solution (Fig. S4†). The XRD data in Fig. S5B† show that the intensity ratios of (111) and (200) peaks increase with increasing Cl− concentration which correspond to the higher number of AgMPl population. The silver nanostructures13,42 similar to those in Fig. 2C–F have been employed for electronic device fabrication and the substrate for a thin film solar cell. The smooth surface with a large contact area enables a prolonged service lifetime in conductive ink and high photocurrent enhancement in thin film solar cells.13
 Fig. 2  SEM micrographs show AgMPls synthesized by H2O2 reduction of [Ag(NH3)2]+ under the influence of [Cl−]: (A) 0, (B) 0.05, (C) 2, (D) 3, (E) 4, (F) 6, (G) 8, (H) 10, and (I) 50 mM. The experimental conditions are [AgNO3] = 10 mM, [H2O2] = 220 mM, [NH4OH] = 90 mM, and [PVP] = 0.5% w/v. The Cl− was introduced in the form of NaCl solution before an addition of H2O2. 
The selective dissolution of multiply twinned and single crystal particles by O2/Cl− (ref. 5, 16–18) and NH4OH/H2O2 (ref. 19 and 20) has been reported. In our case, the O2 gas was in situ generated by the H2O2 oxidation (eqn (2)), the auto-decomposition of H2O2 over a silver surface,29 and the auto-decomposition of H2O2 under alkaline conditions.43 An addition of Cl−, thus, induced formation of an O2/Cl− etchant which was capable of dissolving multiply twinned and single crystals while promoting the survival of AgMPls by Cl− passivation.
To gain an insight into the selective formation of AgMPls under the etching environment, a systematic investigation was performed. Fig. 3 shows the effect of NH4OH, Ag+, H2O2, and PVP on the morphology of silver microstructures. In an acidic medium (pH < 5) without NH4OH (Fig. 3A1), H2O2 cannot reduce Ag+ or AgCl to metallic sliver at any concentration.34 The reducing efficiency of H2O2 could be enhanced by increasing pH either by NH4OH or NaOH (ref. 34, 35, 44) (Fig. S6†). When a minute amount of NH4OH was added (Fig. 3A2), AgNPls was formed. However, residual AgCl particles remained due to an incomplete reduction at a near neutral pH. The formation of AgNPls suggested that a seed selection process was initiated with an introduction of NH4OH. Quasi-sphere AgMPs were obtained when the reduction was conducted under NaOH (Fig. S6†). At NH4OH concentrations of 0.09–0.18 M, AgMPls (3–40 μm lateral size and 0.2–1.1 μm thickness, Fig. 3A3–A5) were obtained. The reduction was very rapid as AgMPls formed and precipitated within 1 min after an addition of H2O2. At a relatively high NH4OH concentration of 0.45 M, the reduction was incomplete with formation of large AgMPls having a broad size distribution (10–120 μm lateral size). H2O2 was also rapidly exhausted due to the alkaline-induced decomposition and auto-decomposition on the silver surface.29,43
 Fig. 3  SEM micrographs show morphological change of AgMPs induced by the concentration of the reactants: (A) NH4OH, (B) H2O2, (C) AgNO3, and (D) PVP. The concentration is indicated in the figure. The scale bars indicate 10 μm. 

Fig. 3B1 confirmed that H2O2 is the sole reducing agent as AgCl crystals were obtained in the absence of H2O2. By adding a minute amount of H2O2 (0.05 M, Fig. 3B2), AgNPls formed with a remaining solid AgCl. Under the employed conditions, 0.11 M H2O2 was enough to completely convert the [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex to AgMPls (Fig. 3B3–B6). The plate size was increased from 4 μm to 23 μm while the plate thickness was increased from ~400 nm to 700 nm when H2O2 concentration was increased from 0.11 M (Fig. 3B3) to 0.88 M (Fig. 3B6). The sharp edges with smooth basal planes suggested that AgMPls tolerated the oxidative etching at a high concentration of H2O2.

Fig. 3C shows the influence of AgNO3 concentration while the ratio of [H2O2]:[Ag+] was kept constant at 22. Large AgMPls were obtained at a low concentration of AgNO3 (5 mM, Fig. 3C1). The AgMPls systematically transformed to AgNPls as the AgNO3 concentration was increased. The lateral size was decreased from 15 μm to 3 μm while the thickness was decreased from 300 nm to 80 nm as the AgNO3 concentration was increased from 5 mM to 30 mM (Fig. 3C2–C4). However, at an extremely high concentration of AgNO3 (40 mM, Fig. 3C5), a mixture of AgMPls (with a lateral size of 4 μm and thickness of 200 nm) and microspheres (with a particle size of ~1–2 μm) was obtained. The structural change was due to: (1) a large number of seeds generated under a high concentration of H2O2, (2) a rapid growth under an increased concentration of AgNO3, and (3) insufficient etching under a constant Cl− concentration of 4 mM. Although O2/Cl− is known to efficiently etch multiply twinned seeds,5,16–18 silver microspheres in Fig. 3B5 survived due to a low concentration of Cl−. A significant aggregation was also observed at a high concentration of AgNO3 (40 mM, Fig. 3C5) due to insufficient PVP stabilization (0.5% w/v).
From the previous investigations (Fig. 3A–C), PVP (0.5% w/v) functions as a good stabilizer preventing aggregation of AgMPls and AgNPls. PVP is known to preferentially adsorb on the Ag{100} facet.45–47 Without an addition of PVP (Fig. 3D1), only aggregated AgMPs (1–5 μm) were obtained. Surprisingly, an insignificant structural change of AgMPls (with a lateral size of ~6 μm and thickness of 150 nm) was observed as the concentration of PVP was increased from 0.05 to 1% w/v. This minor structural variation suggested that PVP functioned only as a stabilizer without any interference on nucleation and growth of AgMPls (Fig. 3D2–D5). The expansion of the basal plane was induced by the weaker adsorption of PVP on Ag{100} facets45–47 with NH3,6 Cl−,22–26 and AgCl (ref. 26–28) passivation on Ag{111} facets. These resulted in a greater deposition rate of silver atoms on the Ag{100} facet than that on the Ag{111} facet. However, a relatively high concentration of PVP of 2% w/v induced an incomplete reduction as AgCl microparticles (AgClMPs) were the main product with formation of large AgMPls (with a lateral size of ~15 μm and thickness of ~300 nm, Fig. 3D6). As the concentration of H2O2 was kept constant at 220 mM, the formation of AgClMPs indicated an insufficient reduction power of H2O2 at a high concentration of PVP as it forms a stable complex between PVP.48–51
Based on the observed phenomena, we believed that the water soluble [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex is the sole species being reduced by alkaline peroxide. With the available NH4OH, all Ag+ were transformed into the complex.40,52 However, when the alkalinity was adjusted by NaOH, quasi-sphere AgMPs (Fig. S6†) were obtained instead of AgMPls. NH4OH is one of the key factors for the development of plate shape structures as it imposes the following constraints: (1) NH4OH decreases the rate of reduction by forming a stable [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex with lower E0 compared to that of Ag+,38 and (2) NH4OH/H2O2 selectively etches single crystal particles.19,20
One of the interesting phenomena in this system is the survival and systematic growth of large AgMPls under a highly corrosive environment containing O2/Cl−, NH4OH/H2O2, and H2O2. Fig. 4 shows the evolution of AgMPls as the water soluble [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex was reduced by H2O2 solution. After 30 s of H2O2 injection (Fig. 4B), quasi-sphere silver particles (100–200 nm) were generated. At 1 min (Fig. 4C), the quasi-sphere developed into silver crystals including truncated cubes, icosahedra, and plates. At 2 min (Fig. 4D), those crystals grow into microstructures. Interestingly, the plate structures grow larger in terms of number and size (1–4 μm lateral size) compared to those of icosahedra and truncated cubes (0.6–0.8 μm). At 5 min, the majority of the silver structures are large AgMPls (1–10 μm lateral size) with a rough surface (Fig. 4E). A few numbers of small icosahedra and truncated cubes (~0.5 μm) were occasionally observed in SEM micrographs. The change in population and morphology indicated selective dissolution of icosahedra and truncated cubes as those structures completely disappeared after 10 min (Fig. 4F). One interesting morphological change of the AgMPls is the increased smoothness of the basal planes after a prolonged reaction time, as indicated by SEM micrographs in Fig. 4E–H. AgMPls with flat and smooth surfaces were obtained after 60 min.
 Fig. 4  The time dependent SEM micrographs show evolution of AgMPls synthesized under the same conditions as that of Fig. 2F. The time was recorded after an injection of an H2O2 reducing agent. Scale bars indicate 4 μm. 

Fig. 3B6 suggested that the AgMPls were very stable under the extremely high concentration of H2O2 (0.88 M). The stability of AgMPls was due to the passivation of Ag{111} by Cl− (ref. 22–26) and AgCl.26–28 H2O2 and NH4OH/H2O2 selectively destroyed the truncated cubes (single crystal particles),19,20 while O2/Cl− selectively etched the multiply twinned particles.5,16–18 Our results indicated that the O2/Cl− also etched the truncated cubes (Fig. 2A and E).
In Fig. 5, we proposed a mechanism explaining the rapid growth of AgMPls under the employed etching environment. As shown in Fig. 1, H2O2 could reduce the water soluble [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex into silver crystals. The growth of cubes from single crystal seeds, icosahedra and pentagonal rods from multiply twinned seeds, and hexagonal and triangular plates from seeds with stacking faults was thoroughly explained.12,14,15 An addition of Cl− initiated an etching environment with selective survival of plate structures. The asymmetric twinned nanoplates bound by Ag{111} planes with alternated Ag{100} and Ag{111} lateral sides were formed.53,54 The surface passivation of Ag{111} by Cl− and AgCl limited the atomic deposition on the basal planes and decreased the rate of thickness growth. The adsorption of Cl− on the basal planes of AgMPls was confirmed by the EDS and XPS data. The XPS results show that AgCl was adsorbed on the basal planes of as-prepared AgMPls as indicated by the binding energy of Cl 2p at 197.5 and 199.0 eV,55–58Fig. 6B. To confirm the presence of AgCl, as-prepared AgMPls were washed with 0.1 M NH4OH. The trace AgCl was completely removed after washing (Fig. 6B and S4B†). The bare surface of AgMPls was slowly oxidized to Ag2O after prolonged storage under ambient conditions, as indicated by O 1s at 531.5 eV (Fig. 6C).58–60
 Fig. 5  The proposed mechanism on the selective formation of AgMPls under an etching environment containing NH4OH/H2O2, H2O2, O2/Cl−. The single crystal and multiply twinned crystal were selectively destroyed. The stability of the plate structure was due to the passivation of Ag{111} facets. The green facets indicate Ag{100} while the orange facets indicate Ag{111}. 
 Fig. 6  XPS spectra of as-prepared AgMPls (solid line) and 6 month stored AgMPls (dotted line). The as-prepared AgMPls were metallic silver with AgCl passivation as indicated by the Ag 3d (A) and Cl 2p (B) spectra. The surface of cleaned AgMPls was oxidized into Ag2O after prolonged storage as indicated by O 1s spectrum (C). 
In addition, the adsorption of the PVP–Ag+ complex on Ag{100} facets promotes growth along the lateral side10,36,46,61–64 (Fig. S7†). An anisotropic growth due to a faster expansion of Ag{100} compared to that of Ag{111} induces a cyclic structural transformation of triangular, truncated triangular, and hexagonal structures.53,54 The growth continued until the [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex was depleted.
One of the potential applications of our developed technique is the direct fabrication of AgMPs and AgMPls from AgCl precipitates. The silver wastes were normally digested or leached into Ag+ before precipitating as solid AgCl for easy separation. The AgCl precipitates were then converted to metallic silver by electrochemical deposition,65 galvanic replacement,66 chemical reduction67 and hydrometallurgical recovery.68,69 However, the processes are labor intensive, are expensive, and generate more chemical wastes. Due to the 1:1 mole ratio of Ag+:Cl− in the precipitated AgCl, the procedure employed in Fig. 2H could only partially convert AgCl into metallic silver after a prolonged reaction of 15 h (Fig. 7A). The inefficient reduction was due to a very slow conversion of AgCl to the [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex at a relatively low [NH4OH] of 0.09 M while H2O2 cannot reduce solid AgCl to metallic silver. To improve the conversion, NH4OH concentration was increased to 0.18 M (Fig. 7B). Large AgMPls were precipitated when NH4OH concentration was increased to 0.27 and 0.36 M (Fig. 6C and D). In the absence of PVP, for comparison, the precipitates contained microplates, truncated cubes, and icosahedra (Fig. S8†).
 Fig. 7  SEM micrographs show AgMPls directly fabricated from solid AgCl using our developed technique. The experimental conditions are the same as that in Fig. 2H with NH4OH concentrations of (A) 0.09, (B) 0.18, (C) 0.27, and (D) 0.36 M. The scale bars are 200 μm. 
Our technique offers a rapid, economic, and environmentally friendly protocol for silver recovery under ambient conditions. It does not create additional chemical waste as H2O2 was employed as the sole reducing agent. The main advantages of our developed technique include: (1) a high recovery ratio of greater than 95%, (2) easy separation of AgMPls precipitates, (3) recovery of highly pure AgMPls (99.99%, Fig. S9†), (4) tap water or water with Cl− contamination can be employed instead of DI water, and (5) an environmentally friendly process (by-products included O2, H2O, and NH4Cl).
Conclusions
We have developed a simple yet rapid technique for a large scale synthesis of AgMPls from [Ag(NH3)2]+ using H2O2 as the reducing agent under an etching environment containing O2/Cl−, NH4OH/H2O2, and H2O2. A trace Cl− induced an etching environment that only plate structures could withstand as it passivated the Ag{111} facets of the plates. The time dependent SEM investigations confirmed that Cl− promoted the survival of plate structures while selectively destroyed truncated cubes, icosahedra, and pentagonal rods containing Ag{100} envelops. In the system without Cl−, etchants capable of structural selectivity do not exist. As a result, H2O2 reduction of the [Ag(NH3)2]+ complex produces silver microparticles including truncated cubes, icosahedra, pentagonal rods, and plate microstructures with icosahedra as the major product. A potential application of the developed protocol for fabrication of highly pure AgMPls directly from AgCl precipitates has been demonstrated.

Table Content:
AgCl + 2NH4OH ⇄ [Ag(NH3)2]+ + Cl− + 2H2O	(1)
2[Ag(NH3)2]+ + H2O2 → 2Ag + 4NH3 + 2H2O + 1/2O2; E0cell = 0.227 V	(2)

 	Fig. 1  An SEM micrograph of AgMPs synthesized by H2O2 reduction of [Ag(NH3)2]+. The orange and green surfaces indicated {111} and {100} facets, respectively. The experimental conditions are [AgNO3] = 10 mM, [NH4OH] = 0.09 M, [H2O2] = 0.22 M, and [PVP] = 0.5% w/v.	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM micrographs show AgMPls synthesized by H2O2 reduction of [Ag(NH3)2]+ under the influence of [Cl−]: (A) 0, (B) 0.05, (C) 2, (D) 3, (E) 4, (F) 6, (G) 8, (H) 10, and (I) 50 mM. The experimental conditions are [AgNO3] = 10 mM, [H2O2] = 220 mM, [NH4OH] = 90 mM, and [PVP] = 0.5% w/v. The Cl− was introduced in the form of NaCl solution before an addition of H2O2.	 

 	Fig. 3  SEM micrographs show morphological change of AgMPs induced by the concentration of the reactants: (A) NH4OH, (B) H2O2, (C) AgNO3, and (D) PVP. The concentration is indicated in the figure. The scale bars indicate 10 μm.	 

 	Fig. 4  The time dependent SEM micrographs show evolution of AgMPls synthesized under the same conditions as that of Fig. 2F. The time was recorded after an injection of an H2O2 reducing agent. Scale bars indicate 4 μm.	 

 	Fig. 5  The proposed mechanism on the selective formation of AgMPls under an etching environment containing NH4OH/H2O2, H2O2, O2/Cl−. The single crystal and multiply twinned crystal were selectively destroyed. The stability of the plate structure was due to the passivation of Ag{111} facets. The green facets indicate Ag{100} while the orange facets indicate Ag{111}.	 

 	Fig. 6  XPS spectra of as-prepared AgMPls (solid line) and 6 month stored AgMPls (dotted line). The as-prepared AgMPls were metallic silver with AgCl passivation as indicated by the Ag 3d (A) and Cl 2p (B) spectra. The surface of cleaned AgMPls was oxidized into Ag2O after prolonged storage as indicated by O 1s spectrum (C).	 

 	Fig. 7  SEM micrographs show AgMPls directly fabricated from solid AgCl using our developed technique. The experimental conditions are the same as that in Fig. 2H with NH4OH concentrations of (A) 0.09, (B) 0.18, (C) 0.27, and (D) 0.36 M. The scale bars are 200 μm.
