    , Accepted 22nd December 2018First published on 26th December 2018AbstractThe increasing demand for renewable energy has been promoting a rapid development of photovoltaic technologies. Given this, photoinduced thermal emission is being explored with the aim of improving solar cell performance by converting low-energy IR photons into visible light. Here, we report the light-induced blackbody emission from LnO2 (Ln = Pr and Tb) as a potential emitter for thermophotovoltaic applications. Lanthanide dioxides display broad IR absorption and a direct optical band gap of 1.49 (PrO2) and 1.51 eV (TbO2). These materials achieve a maximum temperature of ∼1500 K under a power density excitation of 160 W cm−2 and display a stable bright light emission. Thermal emission can be tuned from laser power density modulation.
1. Introduction
Recently, photoinduced bright light emission has emerged as a potential way to enhance the efficiency of many solar energy conversion technologies.1–3 For instance, to exploit efficiently a broad range of the solar spectrum, hot absorber-emitters have been used to convert the infrared portion of the solar spectrum into thermal emission tuned to energies directly above the photovoltaic bandgap.3–5 In these devices, optically-concentrated sunlight is converted into heat in an absorber, the absorber's temperature increases, heat is conducted to the emitter, and the hot emitter thermally radiates towards the photovoltaic cell, where the radiation is ultimately harnessed to excite charge carriers and generate power.6 Ideally, the emitter temperature needs to be high enough so that the Planck's blackbody peak (Lamb Max) coincides with the bandgap.
Wang et al. reported a planar and compact solar thermophotovoltaic device, which integrates a multiwalled carbon nanotube absorber and a one-dimensional Si/SiO2 photonic-crystal emitter on the same substrate.6 This device leads to experimental efficiencies of 3.2%. In another research study, Wang enhanced device performance through the suppression of 80% of unconvertible photons by pairing a one-dimensional photonic crystal selective emitter with a tandem plasma–interference optical filter. This device achieves a solar-to-electrical conversion rate of 6.8%, exceeding the performance of the photovoltaic cell alone.7
A large class of materials demonstrates visible bright light emission under continuous IR-laser excitation. Among these are transition-metal and lanthanide oxides,8–14 carbon nanotubes,15 graphene,16 rare earth vanadates,17,18 phosphates,19,20 silicates,21 lanthanide complexes,2 and lanthanide-based nanoceramics.22
Some mechanisms have been proposed to explain photoinduced bright light emission. Of these, some, such as photon avalanche,17,19 thermal avalanche,23 dispersive optical bistability,24,25 electron–hole recombination,11 oxygen vacancy emission18 and blackbody radiation,1,17,26 have been previously reported. In fact, there is no consensus amongst scientists on their mechanisms and these require further investigations. It is noteworthy that the even in the dopant presence, the photoinduced blackbody emission is a host matrix-related process. Here, we propose that photoinduced bright light emission originates from phonon-assisted blackbody radiation emission.
Wang et al. postulated that samples with higher melting points and lower thermal conductivities can work at higher blackbody temperatures and dissipate less heat through thermal conduction.1 As a result, the material can achieve higher blackbody emission efficiencies. In addition, the reduction in the particle size can greatly increase the heating.27,28
The most widely studied photoinduced blackbody emitter systems are insulating oxide materials, both doped and undoped, which are almost always nanopowders. Typically, undoped metal oxides need high power density to exhibit blackbody emission and often melting occurs.28–30 Different from other metal oxides, Yb2O3 has an electronic state in which the energy gap matches the energy of the laser excitation and improves the absorption of the light excitation.14
Although there are reports of un-doped metal oxides to generate bright light emission, the lanthanide-doped metal oxides are more efficient. Dopant ions play a role in the generation of photoinduced blackbody emission in oxide materials by using the possible energy transfer processes from energy levels of the rare earth ions to the host thus reducing the thermal conductivity of the host material.31 Between the trivalent rare earth ions, Yb3+ as a dopant (sensitizer in a host lattice) is mainly reported due to its high absorption in the IR range (2F7/2 ← 2F5/2; 980 nm).14 On the other hand, the absorption of Yb3+ at around 980 nm restricts the application of the Yb-based materials to this excitation wavelength. Therefore, the development of absorbers with a broad spectral absorption in the IR range is still required.
Here, we describe for the first time the experimental reflectance-based direct and indirect band gap, and thermal emission of the synthesized lanthanide dioxides TbO2 and PrO2 as well as the commercial Pr6O11 and Tb4O7.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The rare earth (RE) nitrates were obtained by the direct reaction of Tb4O7 and Pr6O11 with nitric acid (PA). The reduction of RE4+ into RE3+ was performed by reaction with hydrogen peroxide. The rare earth oxides (REOs) Tb4O7 (99.99%) and Pr6O11 (99.99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, citric acid from Vetec and ethylene glycol from kinetic LTDA. All reactants were used without further purification.
2.2. Experimental procedures
REO nanoparticles were prepared according to the Pechini method,32 by dissolving lanthanide nitrates (0.5 mmol) and citric acid (1.5 mmol) in 10 mL of ultrapure water, under magnetic stirring. Then, 0.9 mmol of monoethylene glycol was added and, after homogenization, the solution was heated (80 °C) up to obtain a gelatinous material. Next, this material was treated at 300 °C for 30 min. Based on TGA analysis (see Fig. S1†), the resulting black powder was calcined at 800 °C for 4 h.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and morphological characterization
Nanoparticles of the binary oxides TbO2 and PrO2 were successfully synthesized via the Pechini method and confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Fig. 1 shows the experimental XRD patterns of the synthesized PrO2 and TbO2, commercial Pr6O11 and Tb4O7, and corresponding calculated patterns of PrO2, TbO2, Pr2O3 and Tb2O3. In contrast to what has been observed for commercial REOs, the synthesized dioxides show a unique crystalline phase in which the patterns displayed are in agreement with what had been calculated for the cubic calcium fluorite (CaF2) structure (space group Fmm, no.225).33 In addition, the broadening of diffraction peaks is correlated with the small size of the crystallite, as estimated by using the Debye–Scherrer equation,34,35 of 13 nm and 17 nm respectively for synthesized PrO2 and TbO2. The commercial oxides, Pr6O11 and Tb4O7, show crystallite sizes of 28 and 31 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 1  Experimental XRD patterns of the synthesized (PrO2 and TbO2) and commercial (Pr6O11_and Tb4O7) oxides, and calculated patterns of PrO2 (JCPDS-15-37779), Pr2O3 (JCPDS-10-10280), TbO2 (JCPDS-90-09045) and Tb2O3 (JCPDS-15-37837). 
The SEM images in Fig. 2 show nanoparticles with average diameters around 60 and 80 nm of PrO2 and TbO2, respectively, indicating that each particle is an agglomerate composed of smaller crystallites. Furthermore, the DLS size distributions (240 nm for PrO2 and 370 nm for TbO2) indicate that nanoparticles easily aggregate in an ethanol suspension. The commercial REOs (Fig. S2†) show a random particle size as a result of the synthesis method.

3.2. Optical properties
The ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) absorption spectra of both synthesized (PrO2 and TbO2) and commercial (Pr6O11 and Tb4O7) REOs (Fig. 3) are quite similar, exhibiting strong absorption over a wide spectral range. Absorption spectra of commercial and synthesized praseodymium oxide match. In turn, terbium oxide shows significant changes in the spectral profile, mainly at the wavelength of maximum absorbance (red shifted). This behaviour was assigned to the presence of an amount of trivalent lanthanide oxide, Ln2O3, in the commercial terbium oxide higher than in commercial praseodymium oxide, as can be inferred through X-ray data (see Fig. S3b†). In order to determine the optical band gap values of the synthesized (PrO2 and TbO2) and commercial (Pr6O11 and Tb4O7) oxides, the Tauc model36–38 was applied to reflectance spectra; plots [F(R∞)·hν]1/nvs. hν, with n = ½ and 2 for direct and indirect allowed transition, respectively (Fig. 3). There are many reports describing the theoretical and experimental (based on the diffuse reflectance spectrum) optical band gaps of CeO2.39–42 This was not found, however, for PrO2 and TbO2. Due to this lack of reports, we have described here both the direct and the indirect optical band gaps.

According to the theoretical investigations of the optical properties of PrO2 and TbO2, their energy band gaps are 1.1–1.843–45 and 0.5 eV,43 respectively. One may notice that in these investigations, the binary rare earth oxides display a band structure in which the highest valence band consists mainly of 5p, 5d and 4f orbitals of Ln with 2s and 2p of O.44–46 The conduction band is mainly due to the 5d states of Ln hybridized with the Ln-4f states. Experimental data were found only for PrO2 in which band gaps were determined by optical conductivity (2 eV)43,47 and by monitoring the occupied states, with the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) signals, evaluating the empty electronic states (4.5 eV).45

Fig. 3 shows the Tauc plots for direct (b and e) and indirect (c and f) band gaps of synthesized (green and blue lines) and commercial (grey lines) Pr and Tb oxides. The direct band gap values are found to be 1.49 and 1.51 eV for the synthesized PrO2 (Fig. 3b) and TbO2 (Fig. 3e), respectively. For commercial Pr6O11 and Tb4O7, the direct band gaps are 1.53 and 1.62 eV, respectively (see Fig. 3b and e). The indirect band gap values are even lower: 1.33 and 1.40 eV for the synthesized Pr and Tb-dioxide, respectively, and 1.38 and 1.53 eV for the commercial Pr6O11 and Tb4O7 powders, respectively (see Fig. 3c and f). One may notice that the band gap energy of PrO2 was comparably lower than that reported in the experimental data reported43,45 and very close to the calculated values.43 In addition, for both direct and indirect band gaps, experimental observations showed that the presence of the Ln2O3 phase led to an increase of the band gaps beyond the crystallite size decrease effects.48
3.3. Laser-induced blackbody emission
The synthesized and commercial REOs exhibited bright light emission when exposed to a 980 nm continuous wave (CW) laser beam (see Fig. 4 and S4†). As aforementioned, the nature of this emission type from metal oxide materials is assigned in the literature to thermal emission (or Blackbody emission) as a result of nonradiative multiphonon relaxation.1,30,49,50

Fig. 5 shows the corrected emission spectra of the synthesized LnO2 as a function of power density excitation ranging from 50 to 160 W cm−2, using a 980 nm CW diode laser. The emission spectra of the synthesized and commercial REOs are broad and cover the visible and infrared spectral regions (Fig. 5 and S5†). The spectral shape consists of unstructured bands that increase monotonically up to the detector limit in the near infrared region. In addition, the intensity of bright light increases rapidly with increasing power density excitation (see Fig. 4 and S4†).

Each spectrum was fitted according to Planck's law (solid red lines) to obtain the blackbody temperature. SEM images of the surface of PrO2 and TbO2 after irradiation with a 980 CW laser at a power density of 50 (c and f) and 160 W cm−2 (b and e). Scale bar: 50 μm. 
A proof of the thermal nature of the bright light emission exhibited by the synthesized and commercial REOs is provided by the following: (i) matching between emission spectra of the REOs under vacuum (at 40 mPa) and a 100 W incandescent light bulb (tungsten bulb), see Fig. S6† and (ii) the huge intensity gap between the emission spectra of LnO2 under atmospheric conditions (101 kPa) and under vacuum (40 mPa), see Fig. S7.†51 This substantial increase of emission intensity at low pressures is due to the fact that the only the dissipation mechanism was radiative thermal emission, where the dissipation mechanisms due to heat conduction were absent due to the very few points of contact of each particle with neighbouring particles and the low thermal conduction of REOs.
The absolute temperature of the powder lanthanide oxides, irradiated by the CW 980 nm laser, were estimated by fitting the thermal emission data with the Planck blackbody distribution.15,52,53  where I is spectrum intensity at the λ wavelength, h is the Planck constant, c is the speed of light under vacuum, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and A is the scaling factor to account for the geometrical factor for the measuring setup, the detection efficiency of the spectrometer and emissivity.
As can be seen from Fig. 5 and S5,† the measured thermal emission spectra of the PrO2, TbO2, Pr6O11 and Tb4O7 can be well fitted to Planck's law (solid lines) with a blackbody temperature ranging from ∼460 to ∼1500 K when the power density is set from 50 to 160 W cm−2, respectively (see Table S1†). An increase in the excitation power density does not invalidate the Planckian radiation character but increases the blackbody temperature. Comparing these results with the available data in the literature, we verify that the LnO2 employs much milder conditions, compared to other inorganic materials, such as lanthanide oxides,32 lanthanide fluoride,54 lanthanide vanadate,17 lanthanide-based composite,22 and lithium lanthanide tetraphosphate,19 to reach similar temperatures. We believe that the small energy gap and phonon energy of LnO2 (∼600 cm−1)55–57 play an important role in the occurrence and enhancement of photoinduced blackbody emission performance.1 Other important features are the high absorption coefficient and the broad absorption in the NIR region, multiphonon relaxation process and low thermal conductivity of the RE dioxides.1,2 Judging from these characteristics, the association of the LnO2 with solar thermophotovoltaic technologies raises expectations about the use of this material in the improvement of the efficiency of solar panels.6,7,58–63
The dependence of blackbody emission intensity on the laser power density was measured and displayed, shown in Fig. 6 and S10.† Assuming that this dependence is well scaled according to the multiphoton absorption rate, the intensity may be described by the relationship I ∝ Pn, where P is the power density of the incident laser beam and n is the order parameter usually combined with a number of absorbed photons. The log–log plot emphasizes the supralinear dependence of I on the fluence of the laser, in which the fit slopes (n) are approximately 6 (PrO2 and Pr6O11) and 5 (TbO2 and Tb4O7). These values are in agreement with those reported for REOs; however, threshold behaviour was not observed within this power density range, as has been verified in other materials.10,22,54,64

The SEM images in Fig. 4(c and f) and S8† show that after exposure to the CW laser beam with a power density ranging from 50 to 100 W cm−2, the LnO2 powders remain unchanged. On the other hand, after exposure at 160 W cm−2 the surface of the LnO2 had melted. According to X-ray powder diffraction (Fig. S9†), the melting leads to the increase of the crystallite size to 22 and 19 nm, respectively, for PrO2 and TbO2. This observation further confirms the high temperature of the sample under 980 nm CW laser beam excitation and the thermal radiation nature of the emission. However, it is worth mentioning that the melting point of REOs (∼2350 K)65 is higher than the estimated temperature. We assign the melts at the surface of the sample to the crystallite size effect on the melting temperature.66–68
By using an infrared thermal camera, we verify that the temperature of the sample in the region of spot of the laser reaches the values of 1173 (100 W cm−2) and 1440 K (160 W cm−2) for PrO2 and of 1149 (100 W cm−2) and 1322 K (160 W cm−2) for TbO2, with a temperature distribution around the spot of the laser (see images in the Fig. 7c and d). These values are consistent with aforementioned spectrally derived temperature for thermal radiation based on Planck's law. On the other hand, these results contrast with reports for Yb-containing materials in which the measured temperature is below to that estimated by Planck law and therefore conclude that the pure thermal emission due to black body radiation is not the dominant mechanism.2,12
 Fig. 7  Photoinduced blackbody emission intensity measured as a function of time under excitation with a 980 nm CW laser (100 and 160 W cm−2) for PrO2 (a) and TbO2 (b). Blackbody emission of PrO2 (c) and TbO2 (d) acquired under excitation with a 980 nm CW laser at a power density of 100 and 160 W cm−2. Firstly, the emission spectra were acquired at 100 and then at 160 w cm−2 (black circle). Next, the power density was tuned to 100 W cm−2 to perform the second cycle (red circle) measurements, and so on. The images are the photographs (up) and their corresponding thermographic image (bottom) under laser exposure. 
To evaluate the effect of the melting on the stability of blackbody emission of the synthesized REOs, in ambient air, we acquired the emission spectra alternating the excitation power density at 50 (samples did not melt) and 160 W cm−2 (samples melted) three times (see Fig. 7c and d). The excellent overlap between triplicate measured spectra reflects the robustness of the systems and the possibility of tuning the blackbody emission intensity, as well as the temperature, through power density modulation. In addition, the monitoring of the blackbody emission intensity was performed at the wavelength of 780 nm for 20 min under power density excitation at 100 (samples did not melt) and 160 W cm−2 (surface of the samples melted), see Fig. 7a and b. In these experiments, no changes in the blackbody emission intensity of either LnO2 were verified over the entire irradiation time. It is noteworthy that the lack of the decrease in the intensity suggests that the materials at this point of excitation do not evaporate.
Judging by the properties displayed by LnO2, such as a small bandgap, broad absorption band (from UV to IR), low power density to achieve high temperature (∼1500 K) and high thermal stability under environmental conditions, we expect that the LnO2 could be used to boost the performances of the solar cells11 and light emitting diodes,69 among others.
Conclusions
Here, we demonstrate the optical band gap and photoinduced bright light emission of the PrO2 and TbO2 nano-powders under a 980 CW diode laser, under environmental conditions. The cubic calcium fluorite-type structure of nano-powders of LnO2 showed direct/indirect band gaps of 1.49/1.33 and 1.51/1.40 eV, respectively, for PrO2 and TbO2. This small energy gap plays an important role in laser-induced blackbody radiation occurrence at lower power densities. A stable blackbody emission was observed when RE dioxides were irradiated by a 980 CW laser with power density ranging from 50 to 160 W cm−2, while the estimated temperatures were varied from ∼460 to ∼1500 K, respectively. By using an infrared thermal camera, we verify that the maximum temperature of the synthesized LnO2 is consistent with spectrally derived temperature for thermal radiation based on Planck's law. Commercial REOs (Pr6O11 and Tb4O7) exhibited similar properties to synthesized RE dioxides. In addition, the thermal stability of LnO2 permitted the tuning of the blackbody emission intensity, as well as the temperature, through power density modulation. We believe that the incorporation of LnO2 into inorganic systems can improve the performance of blackbody radiation emitters, leading to a unique absorber–emitter material. This topic will be addressed in the near future.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Experimental XRD patterns of the synthesized (PrO2 and TbO2) and commercial (Pr6O11_and Tb4O7) oxides, and calculated patterns of PrO2 (JCPDS-15-37779), Pr2O3 (JCPDS-10-10280), TbO2 (JCPDS-90-09045) and Tb2O3 (JCPDS-15-37837).	 

 	Fig. 2  SEM micrograph (left) and corresponding DLS size distribution (right) of the ethanolic suspension of synthesized REOs. Scale bar: 200 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  Absorption spectra of PrO2 and Pr6O11 (a) and, TbO2 and Tb4O7 (d). Tauc plot to direct (b and e) and indirect (c and f) band gaps of PrO2 (green line), TbO2 (blue line) and the corresponding commercial oxides (grey line).	 

 	Fig. 4  Photograph of the PrO2 and TbO2 under excitation with a 980 nm CW laser at power density ranging from 50 to 160 W cm−2.	 

 	Fig. 5  Photoinduced blackbody emission spectra of the PrO2 (green circle in a) and TbO2 (blue circle in d) recorded under excitation with a 980 CW laser and power density adjusted from 50 to 160 W cm−2. Each spectrum was fitted according to Planck's law (solid red lines) to obtain the blackbody temperature. SEM images of the surface of PrO2 and TbO2 after irradiation with a 980 CW laser at a power density of 50 (c and f) and 160 W cm−2 (b and e). Scale bar: 50 μm.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 6  Double-log plots of pump power vs. integrated intensity of the photoinduced blackbody emission of synthesized REO powders under atmospheric pressure.	 

 	Fig. 7  Photoinduced blackbody emission intensity measured as a function of time under excitation with a 980 nm CW laser (100 and 160 W cm−2) for PrO2 (a) and TbO2 (b). Blackbody emission of PrO2 (c) and TbO2 (d) acquired under excitation with a 980 nm CW laser at a power density of 100 and 160 W cm−2. Firstly, the emission spectra were acquired at 100 and then at 160 w cm−2 (black circle). Next, the power density was tuned to 100 W cm−2 to perform the second cycle (red circle) measurements, and so on. The images are the photographs (up) and their corresponding thermographic image (bottom) under laser exposure.
