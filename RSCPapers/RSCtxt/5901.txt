1. Introduction
With the gradual depletion of non-renewable energy such as petroleum, coal and natural gas, clean renewable energy has become the goal pursued by humans. Hydrogen is regarded as the new generation clean energy source for replacing fossil fuel because it is renewable, high in energy and environmentally friendly. As we all know, photocatalysts and photoelectrodes absorb sunlight to generate photoelectrons and reduce water to produce hydrogen, which is the most ideal way to obtain hydrogen energy in the future.1–7 What's more, solar energy and abundant water are renewable resources, so storing solar energy as hydrogen energy by photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting technology has been considered as one of the most promising strategies to solve the global energy shortage and environmental pollution issues.
Since the first demonstration of PEC water splitting using TiO2 single crystal by Honda and Fujishima, other n-type semiconductors like ZnO, WO3, CdS and multicomponent metal sulfides (Ag–Sn–S, AgInS2, (Ag–In–Zn)S, etc.) as photoanodes, applied in PEC cells, have also received a great deal of attention.8–14 Although metal oxide photoelectrodes show good stability in electrolytes, their poor photocatalytic activities and light adsorption limit their industrial applications. In contrast, binary metal sulfides, such as CdS and CdSe, exhibit robust PEC performance but poor stabilities and high toxicities in aqueous electrolytes, which also limit their commercial applications. Recently, some reports have showed that multicomponent metal sulfides (such as Ag8SnS6, AgInS2, and (Ag–In–Zn)S) with higher PEC performance are more stable than binary metal sulfides in electrolytes.13–15 However, the In element is scarce in the earth's crust (the crustal abundances of Zn and Sn are 1500 times and 45 times greater than that of In) and its price is high.16,17 So, the quaternary chalcogenide Ag2ZnSnS4 (AZTS), derived from the use of nontoxic and cheaper Zn and Sn instead of In in AgInS2, retains the energy band structure and excellent optical and electrical properties of ternary compounds, showing great potential applications in solar energy conversion. Furthermore, AZTS, a direct band gap semiconductor (2.0–2.1 eV), has favorable broad absorption in the visible region and suitable band edge positions for reducing/oxidizing water, making it suitable for the photocatalytic and PEC water splitting.18–24
In recent years, more attention has been devoted to improve preparation (CBD, spin/dip-coating) and performance of AZTS photoanode, but its photon-to-electron conversion efficiency is still low and PEC performance is unstable.20–24 Different from the above-mentioned conventional methods, electrodeposition was proven to be feasible and effective method to fabricate multiple components and integrated film electrodes owing to its unique intrinsic advantages:25–27 low cost, large-scale industrial application, universal applicability, controllable morphology and composition. Meanwhile, the loading of protecting overlayer can effectively prevent photo corrosion to increase stability during water oxidation reaction.
Thus, in this study, electrochemical deposition and in situ sulfurization are used to prepare the AZTS photoelectrode with different surface morphologies and thickness on the Mo-mesh substrate to explore and determine its PEC performance. The prepared AZTS photoanode without modification by co-catalyst can yield a photocurrent density of 4.0 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE. In addition, the effect of the presence of protecting overlayers of TiO2 deposited by ALD on photoelectric stability of AZTS are investigated. IPCE measurements are used to evaluate solar energy utilization efficiencies of AZTS and TiO2/AZTS photoanode, which show 25% and 20% IPCE in water splitting reaction, respectively. The analysis of gas yields determined that the faradaic efficiency during the H2 evolution process is over 90%. Finally, the reasons for the high photoelectrochemical performance of AZTS/Mo-mesh and a profound understanding of the mechanism of PEC H2 evolution in the system are discussed in the following part.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and reagents
All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. All the reagents used in the experiment, including AgNO3, NaOH, Na2SO4, Na2SO3 and Na2S·9H2O were purchased from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). SnCl2·2H2O and ZnCl2 were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Mo-mesh and Ti-mesh with a mesh number of 100 per inch and Mo-foil (thickness: 0.03 mm) were cut to 0.5 cm × 2 cm and soaked in 20% hydrochloric acid for 24 hours, and then ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, ethanol and acetone for 30 min before use.
2.2. Preparation of Ag2ZnSnS4 photoanode
AZTS photoanode was prepared via an electrodeposition and in situ sulfurization method. A typical three-electrode cell was used for electrodeposition using a platinum plate as counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode. Firstly, metal Ag was electroplated onto the Mo-mesh in AgNO3 solution (10 mM) at 0.0 V vs. SCE. Different amounts of Ag were deposited by adjusting the deposition time and deposition charge quantities (0.4 C, 0.8 C and 1.2 C cm−2), and the prepared photoelectrodes were named as AZTS-X. Secondly, metal Sn was electroplated onto the Mo-mesh, plated with Ag layer in SnCl2 solution (20 mM) at −1.2 V vs. SCE, which was an aqueous alkaline (pH: ~13.3) solution (by adding NaOH). Thirdly, metal Zn was electroplated onto the Mo-mesh plated with Sn/Ag layers in ZnCl2 solution (0.1 M) at −1.35 V vs. SCE, which was an aqueous alkaline (pH: ~10.0) solution (by adding NH3·H2O). The amounts of deposited individual metals were controlled by regulating charges passed for each deposition. The electroplated samples were washed with deionized water and dried with pure N2 every time. Finally, the Mo-mesh plated with Zn/Sn/Ag (charge quantities ratio: 2/2/1) layers was sulfurized heated to 550 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 and kept for 1 h in an atmosphere of H2S, and then cooled naturally while purging with pure N2. As a result, AZTS photoanode on Mo-mesh in dark red was obtained.
2.3. Preparation of TiO2/Ag2ZnSnS4 photoanode
TiO2 was deposited onto as-prepared AZTS photoanode using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) system (PEALD-100A, Jiaxing KE-MICRO). The ALD was carried out at a substrate temperature of 250 °C. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) was deposited using titanium(IV) isopropoxide and H2O as the Ti source and O source, respectively. Different reaction precursors were alternately fed into the reaction chamber in the form of gas pulses and held in the chamber for 2.0 s, followed by 80.0 s nitrogen purge. The cycle numbers were varied to control the film thickness, which was calculated using the GPC values (1.1 Å per cycle at 250 °C). In this study, one hundred loops were deposited on each side of the AZTS, so the ALD TiO2 layer thickness was estimated to be 11 nm.
2.4. Materials characterization
XRD pattern of the photoelectrode was carried out on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα irradiation (λ = 1.54 Å). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on a Hitachi S-4800 microscope with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The detailed and clear nanostructure was characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a VG MicroTech ESCA 3000 X-ray photoelectron spectroscope with a monochromatic Al-Kα source to explore the elements on the surface, and the binding energies were calibrated by the C 1s peak (284.6 eV). The amount of H2 generation was determined by gas chromatography (GC-7806, Shiweipx, Beijing) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (Ar as a carrier gas).
2.5. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements
Photoelectrochemical properties of as prepared photoelectrodes were carried out using the three-electrode system with a Princeton Applied Research EG&G 263A electrochemical analyzer. The prepared photoelectrode was used as working electrode, a Pt plate and a commercially available Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte used in all measurements was an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M Na2SO4, 0.05 M Na2S and 0.05 M Na2SO3 at a pH value of 12.8. Before the initiation of experiment, Ar was bubbled for half an hour to remove the dissolved O2. All measurements were carried out with Ag/AgCl as reference electrode, but final potentials in this work were converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale according to the eqn (1): ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197 + 0.059pH(1)
Photocurrent density–applied potential (J–V) and photocurrent density–time (J–t) scans were performed in the three-electrode cell with the above-mentioned electrolyte under simulated sunlight. A 300 W Xe lamp (Perfectlight, Beijing) coupled with an AM1.5 global filter (100 mW cm−2) was used as the light source. The scan rate for the linear sweep voltammetry was 5 mV s−1. The J–t curves were measured at 0.4 V vs. RHE in a closed circulation system. During the measurements of stable photocurrent, the evolved H2 was analyzed by gas chromatography.
The incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained by measuring the photocurrent density under monochromatic light irradiation with a 500 W Xe lamp coupled with a grating monochromator, and then calculating the IPCE using eqn (2),28–30 where Iph is the photocurrent density, λ the incident light wavelength, and Pmono is the calibrated and monochromated illumination power intensity. The illumination intensities of the monochromatic light were measured with a PM 100A Optical Power Meter (ThorLabs). (2)
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in potentiostatic mode from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at 0.4 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G illumination. Mott–Schottky measurements were carried out at a frequency of 1 kHz in dark. The detailed derivation procedure of the Mott–Schottky relation was as following:31–34 for n-type semiconductors, the relationship between the capacitance (C) and the applied potential (E) can be expressed as eqn (3); the donor densities (Nd) were calculated according to eqn (4); assuming that capacitance (Csc) of the space charge layer conformed to a plate capacitor model, the thickness of the space charge layer (dsc) was calculated following the eqn (5). (3) (4) (5)where Csc is the capacitance of space charge layer, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), ε is the relative permittivity of AZTS (ε ≈ 10),35e is the electron charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), Nd is the donor density, E is the applied potential at the electrode, Efb is the flat-band potential, k is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 × 10−23 J K−1), T is the absolute temperature (273.15 K), and dsc is the thickness of the space charge layer.
3. Results and discussion
As demonstrated in Fig. 1, a simple electroplating-sulfurization method is employed to prepare an Ag2ZnSnS4 (AZTS) thin film photoanode on Mo-mesh substrate. The sequential depositions of individual metal layer in the order of Zn/Sn/Ag are electroplated in three separate plating solutions and under three different deposition conditions. The amounts of each metal deposited are controlled by adjusting the deposition charge quantities carefully. The specific test parameters have been recorded in the Experimental section. The standard reduction potentials of Ag, Sn and Zn show a wide range (eqn (i), (ii) and (iii)).25 Due to the chemical stability of Ag, the reduction potential of Ag+ is positive compared to those of Sn2+ and Zn2+. To increase ions' solubility, a certain amount of NaOH or NH3·H2O is added as a complexing agent for Sn2+ and Zn2+, respectively. Cathodic reduction of Sn2+ or Zn2+ is easier in an aqueous alkaline solution, due to an increase in the pH changing the reduction potential of metal ions and inhibiting the production of hydrogen. Ag+ + e− → Ag, E0 = +0.80 V(i) Sn2+ + 2e− → Sn, E0 = −0.141 V(ii) Zn2+ + 2e− → Zn, E0 = −0.762 V(iii) (iv)
 Fig. 1  A detailed scheme used to prepare AZTS photoanode. 
Conversion of stacked elemental metal layers (Zn/Sn/Ag) to AZTS thin film is carried out at 550 °C in an inert atmosphere (N2) containing a sulfur source (5% H2S gas) in the furnace (eqn (iv)). The actual color change of the precursors prepared at different stages during electrodeposition process is shown in Fig. S1.†
The crystalline phase and composition of AZTS is characterized by XRD as shown in Fig. 2 and S2.† XRD patterns of AZTS-X photoanode with different deposition charge quantities (X = 0.4 C, 0.8 C and 1.2 C) are demonstrated in Fig. 2a. In addition to the 4 peaks of Mo-mesh substrate matching JCPDS card no 42-1120, we can see that other peaks are in good agreement with the values given in the JCPDS card no. 35-544. So, the XRD patterns for AZTS photoanode are identical to those reported for Ag2ZnSnS4 (AZTS) powder materials.19–21 The characteristic diffraction peaks (round mark) that appeared at about 27.3°, 30.8°, 44.2°, 45.9°, 52.7° and 82.8° are attributed to (112), (200), (220), (204), (132) and (244) crystal planes of tetragonal AZTS. The diffraction peaks (diamond mark) at about 40.5°, 58.6°, 73.7° and 87.6° are attributed to the Mo substrate. No diffraction peaks for any other crystal phases such as Ag2S, ZnS and Ag8SnS6 can be detected, indicating that there are no impurity phases existing in the obtained sample. These results can prove that the synthesis of impurity-free AZTS on the Mo-mesh substrate by an electroplating-sulfurization method is simple and feasible. As shown in Fig. 2b, for the TiO2/AZTS-0.8 C photoanode, the diffraction peaks of TiO2 are not detected, which could be ascribed to the fact that the thin deposition layer of titanium dioxide is amorphous at low reaction temperature (250 °C) during the ALD process.

Surface morphologies and clear nanostructure of the samples are investigated by SEM and TEM as shown in Fig. 3 and S3.†Fig. 3a indicates that the Mo mesh could be completely covered by large and strong crystalline particles. The surface of AZTS is composed of irregular spherical grains with size of about 1–5 μm, as seen in Fig. 3b, c. Moreover, there are small holes in some bigger grains, as shown a red ellipse in Fig. 3c. From the side-view image of AZTS-0.8 C photoanode (Fig. 3d), the thickness of as prepared film electrode is estimated to be 2 μm. Furthermore, it can be found that AZTS-0.8 C possesses more pores in some fragments which were peeled from the substrate by ultrasound (Fig. 3e). The nanoporous structure is beneficial to its photoelectrochemical properties.30,36–38 A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (inset in Fig. 3e) demonstrates that the distinct lattice fringes of d = 0.327 nm and 0.198 nm match with the (112) and (204) crystallographic planes of AZTS, respectively, and they are in good agreement with the XRD patterns (Fig. 2). As seen in Fig. 3c and f, the surface morphologies of AZTS photoanode don't change after depositing TiO2 layer via an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process.

EDS element mapping results of TiO2/AZTS-0.8 C and AZTS-0.8 C photoanode are shown in Fig. 4 and S4,† respectively. As seen in Fig. 4, TiO2 layer was successfully deposited on the AZTS. These results also indicate that Ag, Zn, Sn and S elements are uniformly dispersed in the system. Furthermore, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements have been carried out to identify the elemental compositions in AZTS-0.8 C (Fig. S5†). These results reveal that the Ag:Zn:Sn:S molar ratio obtained from EDS analysis for AZTS is 2.0:1.1:1.0:4.1, which is very close to the theoretical Ag:Zn:Sn:S ratio (2:1:1:4) for pristine Ag2ZnSnS4. The slightly Zn rich or Sn poor compositions deviate from stoichiometric AZTS, maybe due to small deviations in the amount of individual metal deposited charges or some metals loss with high vapor pressure at higher temperature.39

More details about the elemental compositions, metal valences and oxidation states of photoelectrodes are further obtained using XPS technology. As shown in Fig. 5a, the peaks of Ag-2p are split into 367.8 eV (3d5/2) and 373.8 eV (2d3/2) with a split orbit of 6.0 eV, which is in accordance with the value of Ag+.19,40 The peaks of Zn-2p (Fig. 5b) appearing at binding energies of 1022.1 eV (2p3/2) and 1045.3 eV (2p1/2) with a peak splitting of 23.2 eV can be assigned to Zn2+. As seen in Fig. 5c, the peaks of Sn-3d are split into 486.5 eV (3d5/2) and 494.9 eV (3d3/2) with a split orbit of 8.4 eV, which is in accordance with the value of Sn4+. The peaks of S-2p are split into 161.7 eV (2p3/2) and 162.9 eV(2p1/2) in sulfide phases. To gain more insight into amorphous TiO2 in the thin films, the chemical states of Ti and O were investigated by XPS, and high-resolution XPS peaks for Ti-2p and O-1s are shown in Fig. 5e, f. The fitting peaks appearing at binding energies of 459.1 eV (2p3/2) and 464.8 eV (2p1/2) with a peak splitting of 5.7 eV can be assigned to Ti4+. For the O-1s region, chemical states of O-1s are split into 3 fitting peaks. The main contribution is assigned to lattice oxygen of TiO2 (O1, 530.1 eV), and the other 2 kinds of oxygen contributions can be ascribed to adsorbed –OH groups (O2, 531.6 eV) and oxygen chemisorbed or adsorbed water molecules on the catalyst surface (O3, 532.4 eV), respectively.41–43 Thus, the coexistence of Ti-2p and O-1s can further demonstrate that TiO2 is synthesized and deposited on the surface of AZTS successfully.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) experiments are performed using a three-electrode system to further examine the activity of AZTS photoanode in PEC cell. Fig. 6a depicts the J–V curves of AZTS photoanodes with different deposition charge quantities and TiO2/AZTS-0.8 C photoanode. The photocurrent density first increases and then decreases with the increasing of deposition charge quantities, and the AZTS photoelectrode shows lower onset potential (−0.05 V) and best characteristics when the deposition charge density is about 0.8 C cm−2, as shown in the Fig. 6a. Pristine AZTS-0.8 C photoanode yields a photocurrent density of 4.0 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE, which is the best performance compared to that of previous reports.20–24 So, for preparing AZTS photoanode, it is important to control the deposition charge quantities. The smaller deposited amounts AZTS-0.4 C with thinner thickness have poor coverage and loose structures (Fig. S3a and S6a†), exposing a significant fraction of the bare Mo mesh surface leading to electric leakage, which is probably the main factor that limits its photocurrent generation. However, film that is too thick (Fig. S3c and S6c†) is also not beneficial for the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, and the separation of photoelectrons and holes is limited because greater thickness (larger deposited amounts AZTS-1.2 C) makes it difficult for the transport of holes to the photoanode surface and is good for the recombination of electrons and holes in the body. At last, we find that AZTS-0.8 C with optimal thickness and dense surface structure (Fig. S3b and S6b†) can not only reduce dark current, resulting from the leakage current between the substrate and the electrolyte, but also can further enhance PEC performance, owing to smaller charge-transfer resistance (Rct = 850 Ω) in the EIS Nyquist plot (Fig. 6b), better electroconductivity and easier transfer of photogenerated electrons from the surface to the Mo substrate. Therefore, we choose AZTS-0.8 C for further testing and characterization. Here, we choose Mo mesh as the substrate, owing to its porous structure and large surface area facilitating the diffusion of protons or hydroxide ions from the solution to the electrode surface, excellent conductivity facilitating transfer of electron from the bulk electrode to the external circuit and the flexibility for easier preparation of photoelectrodes of different shapes, compared with rigidity of ITO and FTO substrates.44 To show the advantage of this facile method and the selection of Mo-mesh instead of planar Mo or other metal mesh, we provide a comparison of photoelectrochemical performance between the AZTS film on Mo-foil and the AZTS film on Mo-mesh and Ti-mesh, as shown in Fig. S7.† From Fig. S7,† under the same test conditions, the photocurrent density of AZTS-0.8 C/Mo-mesh is significantly higher than that of AZTS-0.8 C/Mo-foil and AZTS-0.8 C/Ti-mesh, and the Rct of AZTS-0.8 C/Mo-mesh is significantly smaller than that of AZTS-0.8 C/Mo-foil and AZTS-0.8 C/Ti-mesh, showing the superiority of Mo-mesh as an electrode substrate. In addition, we have listed the results of previous studies in Table S1† to allow easy comparison, which can fully highlight the progress of this method and the superiority of performance.

(d) Time course curves of H2 evolution in PEC cell at 0.4 V vs. RHE under simulated sunlight radiation. 

Fig. 6c shows photocurrent density–time (J–t) curves of photoanodes at a potential of 0.4 V vs. RHE. During the PEC experiment, pristine AZTS photoanode displays poor stability, and the photocurrent density of AZTS-0.8 C decreases to 1.4 mA cm−2 from 3.5 mA cm−2 in an hour. The significant decrease of photoactivity is attributed to surface photo corrosion during the reaction caused by oxidation of S2− by the photoanode, although the electrolyte contains the sacrificial reagents (Na2S + Na2SO3). Surface photo corrosion phenomenon has been confirmed by Fig. S2 and S3d.† Fig. S2† shows XRD patterns of as-prepared AZTS-0.8 C photoanode and TiO2/AZTS photoanode before and after photocurrent density–time (J–t) durability test. Compared with fresh AZTS-0.8 C and TiO2/AZTS photoanodes, the characteristic peak of TiO2/AZTS photoanode is still prominent and there is no significant decrease in crystallinity after a long illumination. SEM images of AZTS-0.8 C photoanode surface before and after the photoelectrochemical durability test are shown in Fig. S3b and d,† respectively. The surface of fine spherical grains became rough owing to photo corrosion during oxidation. To improve the PEC stability of AZTS photoanode as an efficient anti-photocorrosion catalyst during the water oxidation reaction, TiO2 was deposited on the surface through an ALD method. Fig. 6c shows J–t comparison curves of pristine AZTS and TiO2/AZTS photoanodes, and from the results we can see that the photocurrent density decreases soon after depositing TiO2, but the PEC stability improves significantly. The PEC performances of AZTS-0.8 C photoanode and TiO2/AZTS-0.8 C photoanode measured in neutral Na2SO4 (0.1 M) and NaOH (0.1 M) solutions without sacrificial reagents and Na2SO4 (0.1 M) solution with sacrificial reagents (0.05 M Na2S + 0.05 M Na2SO3) are depicted in Fig. S8.† Protection by the TiO2 layer improves the stability of photoanodes, as shown in Fig. S8c.† Although the photocurrent density significantly decreases in neutral or alkaline solutions without sacrificial agents, the TiO2/AZTS photoanode can still improve the stability of pristine AZTS photoanode. The reason for the above results may be that TiO2 layer affects the absorption and utilization of light by AZTS and can be used as a protecting layer to avoid the contact between the AZTS layer and electrolyte solution.
To confirm the faradaic efficiency of the photoelectrode, the amounts of H2 evolved in the PEC cell during irradiation with simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G) are analyzed using a gas chromatograph, as shown in Fig. 6d. From the results we can see that H2 generation is satisfactory and the curve is linear in 1 hour, which is almost consistent with the expected values calculated from the photocurrent (red line). The analysis of gas yield determined that the faradaic efficiency during the H2 evolution process was over 90%. In general, the AZTS photoanode after depositing TiO2 can show high faradaic efficiency and good stability in the PEC water splitting experiment.
The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as an important index for evaluating solar energy utilization efficiency and is characterized as shown in the Fig. 7a. From Fig. 7a we get IPCE values of AZTS-0.8 C and TiO2/AZTS-0.8 C photoelectrodes measured under irradiation of monochromatic light with various wavelength at 0.4 VRHE. For pristine AZTS-0.8 C photoanode, the IPCE at 530 nm is about 25%, which is much higher than that of reported pristine AZTS, as shown in Table S1.†21,24 For TiO2/AZTS-0.8 C photoanode, the IPCE value is about 21% under the same monochromatic wavelength of illumination. IPCE measurements prove that TiO2 does not expand light absorption but reduces the solar energy utilization efficiency (390 to 480 nm), which is consistent with reduced photocurrent of TiO2/AZTS-0.8 C (see Fig. 6a, c). The spectra show IPCE of 20–25% at wavelengths ranging from 480 to 530 nm; the IPCE value declines steeply at wavelengths longer than 550 nm. Thus, the IPCE spectrum data of AZTS-0.8 C agree well with the absorption spectrum data of AZTS nanoparticles, indicating that the photoexcitation of AZTS grains on Mo substrate is responsible for photocurrent generation. The onset region of the IPCE spectrum is also analyzed to determine the band gap (Eg) of the photoelectrode. As it has been reported previously,45–47 IPCE can be related to Eg by the following eqn (6): (IPCE) × (hν) = A(hν − Eg)n,(6)where A is the proportionality constant, Eg is the band gap of the material, hv is the incident photon energy and n is an index that characterizes the optical absorption process, which, theoretically, equals to 2.0 and 0.5 for an indirect and direct band gaps (for AZTS, n = 0.5). As shown in the Fig. 7b, by converting the deformation of the spectra into [IPCE × hν]2versus photon energy (hν (eV)) plot at the onset region, the band gap energy (Eg = ∼2.05 eV) of the AZTS photoanode is determined from the intercept of the hv axis, which is almost the same as that reported earlier.19,48,49 Our previous paper had made estimations of the conduction band (CB) edge of the AZTS, and the energy level position of the CB edge is at about −0.32 eV.49 Because the band gap of the AZTS is about 2.05 eV (Fig. 7b), the energy level position of the valence band (VB) edge should be at about 1.73 eV.

(b) Plots of [IPCE × hν]2vs. hν of the AZTS-0.8 C photoanode. The band structures (c) and density of states (d) obtained from theoretical calculation for AZTS. 
To fully evaluate the electronic structure and optical properties of AZTS, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) are used to estimate the density of states. Fig. 7c shows the energy band structures of AZTS obtained from generalized gradient approximation with the Hubbard-U correction (GGA + U) and the hybrid functional method (HSE). Based on these results, we can conclude that AZTS has a direct band gap with the VBM and CBM located at the Γ point, which is beneficial for the optical absorption and emission.35 The calculated Eg = 2.04 eV of AZTS is basically consistent with the actual experimental value (∼2.05 eV). Fig. 7d gives the calculation results of the total density of states (TDOS) of AZTS. From these results we conclude that the CBM is mainly derived from the S-3p and Sn-5s states, and the VBM is mainly contributed by S-3p and Ag-4d states, which is consistent with the early reports.18,35,50 Calculations show that the transitions from the Ag-4d and S-3p states into the conduction band determine the optical properties of AZTS in the visible light region.49,51,52
Based on the above PEC experiments and characterization results, we have proposed a possible mechanism to explain the high performance of AZTS photoelectrode, as shown in Fig. 8. The AZTS photoelectrode shows anodic photocurrent and positive slopes of Mott–Schottky plot (Fig. 6a and S9†), indicating the n-type semiconducting properties of AZTS sample. When the photoelectrode is immersed in the solution and is in close contact with it, the difference between the energy levels of both gives rise to the flow of electrons. Owing to the low carrier concentration of semiconductors, the space charge layer and the built-in electric field are formed. Their presence leads to the energy band bending appearing at the interface between the photoelectrode and the electrolyte. Finally, the Fermi level in the space charge region and the electrochemical energy level in the electrolyte reach equilibrium. As shown in the Fig. 8a, when the photoelectrode is under a flat-band potential (Efb), there is no energy band bending (dsc = 0 nm). Obviously, photocurrent is not generated when the photoelectrode/electrolyte system is exposed to light irradiation in the case of a flat-band potential because photogenerated carriers can't be separated at the interface in this state. So, the onset of current density under illumination can also be treated as a measure of the flat-band potentials.12,33,53 The flat-band potentials obtained onset points in J–V curves (see Fig. 6a) are almost the same as those obtained from Mott–Schottky plots of AZTS (Efb = −0.05 VRHE in the Fig. S9†).

For n-type AZTS photoelectrode, a depletion layer is formed at the solid–liquid interface when the applied potential is higher than (positive) the flat-band potential (electrons are pumped away), i.e., E > Efb = −0.05 VRHE. Calculated band alignments at the solid/electrolyte interface for pristine AZTS photoelectrode are shown in the Fig. 8b. When E = 0.4 VRHE, the thickness of the space charge layer is about 2.2 nm (using eqn (5)), the energy bands are bent upwards and the Fermi level in the space charge region is restrained by the external potential to bend downwards, and surface of the photoanode has positive charges. In general, the photocurrent generated by the semiconductor electrode is closely related to the degree of energy band bending. When a positive potential (anodic polarization) is applied to the AZTS photoanode under illumination, the degree of band bending increases, and the thickness of the space charge layer (dsc) at the solid–liquid interfaces increases, induces more electric field and causes better electrons and holes separation, which inevitably increases the photocurrent of the photoelectrode.54–56 It's remarkable that changing the applied potential causes the injection of carriers. Also, the degree of band bending can be changed and the position of the Fermi level at the interface relative to the band edge is inevitably affected. However, the position of the internal (neutral region) Fermi level of the semiconductor relative to the conduction band or valence band energy level is constant.56,57 Schematic diagram of H2 evolution in a PEC cell using AZTS photoanode under simulated sunlight radiation is shown in the Fig. 8c. When photons with an appropriate light wavelength (≤600 nm) are absorbed by the tetragonal AZTS photoanode, electron–hole pairs are created. As a result, photogenerated electrons transferring to the conduction band can diffuse inside the semiconductor. They are easily sucked away by Mo-mesh substrate (WFMo = 4.6 eV > WFAZTS ≈ 4.22 eV obtained from Fig. S10†) and, finally, they migrate to the counter electrode (Pt) owing to the built-in electric field (intrinsic driving force of carrier separation) within the depletion layer and external applied bias. Then, the photogenerated electrons can reduce the water to generate H2 around the Pt plate. Meanwhile, the SO32− and S2− are oxidized to SO42− and S2O32− by the photogenerated holes around the interface between photoanode and electrolyte, as expressed by the following eqn (7)–(9):58,59 2S2− + 2h+ → S22−, E0 = 0.306 V vs. RHE(7) SO32− + S2− + 2h+ → S2O32−, E0 = 0.059 V vs. RHE(8) SO32− + 2OH− + 2h+ → SO42− + 2H2O, E0 = −0.141 V vs. RHE(9) ERHE = ENHE + 0.059pH(10)
For better comparison, all potentials in this work are converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale using eqn (10). The separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers is improved and the recombination rate is lowered in the presence of the sacrificial agents. Finally, the photocurrent is detected between the two electrodes by the external circuit connection. The faradaic efficiency demonstrates that the AZTS photoanode and Pt electrode almost take full advantage of photogenerated carriers, and the photogenerated electrons and holes can be effectively separated. Consequently, the prepared AZTS on the Mo mesh substrate shows high photoelectrochemical efficiency.
4. Conclusion
In this study, we report a novel electrodeposition and in situ sulfurization method for preparing Ag2ZnSnS4 photoanode on the Mo-mesh substrate. J–V curves demonstrate that surface morphology and thickness of AZTS with different deposition charge quantities could be responsible for its photoelectrochemical properties. Pristine AZTS photoanode shows lower onset potential and higher photocurrent density of 4.0 mA cm−2 at 0.6 V vs. RHE. Besides, IPCE data show that the AZTS has high solar energy utilization efficiency (maximum: 25%) in the region of 400 to 550 nm. TiO2 is deposited via ALD process to further improve the photoelectrochemical stability and the faradaic efficiency is over 90%. In summary, the reasons for the high photoelectrochemical performance of AZTS electrodes on Mo substrate are listed below. (1) The molybdenum mesh as a substrate has a porous structure, large surface area and high conductivity, facilitating carrier transport and the diffusion of protons or hydroxide ions at the solid–liquid interface; its flexibility makes it easier to prepare photoelectrodes of different shapes. (2) Due to the built-in electric field (intrinsic driving force of carrier separation) within the depletion layer and external applied bias, the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers is improved and the recombination rate is lowered in the presence of the sacrificial agents. (3) The work function of Mo (4.6 eV) is larger than the work function of Ag2ZnSnS4 (∼4.22 eV), so, the photogenerated electrons transferring to the conduction band are easily sucked away by contacting the Mo-mesh substrate. Eventually, they migrate to Pt for H2 evolution through the external circuit. (4) AZTS photoanode has the suitable band gap (∼2.05 eV) and ideal band alignment position near the solid–liquid interface.
