    , Accepted 17th October 2022First published on 18th October 2022AbstractIt is extraordinarily exigent to solve the efficiency of 6H+/6e− photoreduction of CO2 and H2O into methanol as the major product, which is limited by the severe photogenerated carrier recombination, the reoxidation of methanol at high temperature, and photocorrosion of catalysts. Herein, we developed an elaborate gas–liquid–solid system assembled by using a novel multicomponent SrTiO3 (La Cr)/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN (STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN) heterojunction, realizing a highly efficient and robust photocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol at low temperature. STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN exhibits excellent light absorption and high charge carriers separation nature, and the evolution of methanol is 25.8 μmol (h gcat.)−1 roughly not only 173 folds higher than those observed compared with the STO counterpart, but also is 50 times that those of traditional gas–solid two-phase system. Of note, these improved performances are attributed to the enhancement of the local surface plasmonic resonance of Cu@Ni nanoparticles by changing the local medium dielectric constant and prolonged carrier's lifetime originating from heterostructure. Moreover, plasmonic TiN nanoparticles play an important role in remaining the triphase interfacial system temperature at 90 °C and increasing methanol production excellently. While, the ionic liquid in the gas–liquid–solid system can activate CO2 molecules, thereby greatly improves the yield of methanol. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and 13C isotope labeling tests reveal the reaction path of CO2 on the photocatalyst surface. This work may provide a new direction for the efficient photoreduction of CO2 to methanol.
1. Introduction
CO2 excessive emission has caused various environmental problems and energy crises.1–7 It is essential to capture and recycle them as valuable products and fuels through thermochemistry,8 electrochemistry,9–11 and photocatalysis.12–14 Among these, the photoreduction of CO2 is an attractive method to produce high-value fuels and chemicals.1 The products of photoreduction of CO2 reported generally are complex,15–17 such as C1 products18 or C2 products.19 CH3OH obtained from the 6H+/6e− photoreduction of CO2 is considered a key chemical and platform molecule.20–22 However, the photoreduction of CO2 to methanol is limited by the high photogenerated carrier recombination, the reoxidation of methanol at high temperature, and the stability of the photocatalyst. Therefore, it is necessary to research the highly efficient and stable photocatalysts and photoreduction systems for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH3OH.
Many works have focused on developing photocatalysts and the optimization of mass transfer for efficient CO2 conversion. Among these works, many metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)23 and metal free photocatalysts18 often suffer from narrow spectral absorption, poor CO2 absorption, and sluggish carrier separation kinetics. Ding et al.18 developed a metal-free catalyst for photoreduction of CO2 to CH3OH, realizing satisfactory productivity of 9.9 μmol g−1 h−1 and excellent selectivity of 94% at 80 °C. In addition, the overall photoconversion efficiency of photocatalysts without organic frameworks is also limited due to some inherent defects, such as narrow bandgap and severe photocorrosion. To overcome these deficiencies, a lot of strategies to produce photocatalysts are proposed, such as defect engineering and heterojunction. The light absorption of semiconductor-based catalysts is enhanced by the method of using metal elements and non-metal elements24–27 to introduce doping energy levels in the bandgap of semiconductors.26,28–34 In particular, some dopped plasmonic materials can also increase the adsorption of CO2 by semiconductor-based catalysts.25,27,30,35–38 The selective photoreduction of CO2 to methanol can be achieved by the composite photocatalysts doped copper,22,39 zinc,22,40 and bismuth.22,41 The other promising solution is that heterojunction photocatalysts have the advantages of high light absorption, suppressed charge-hole recombination, and fast charge transport. Li et al.42 prepared a type II heterojunction photocatalyst (ZnSe–CsSnCl3) which exhibited excellent photogenerated carrier separation efficiency. Under visible light irradiation, the evolution of CO from the photoreduction of CO2 was 57μmol g−1 h−1. The Z-scheme heterostructures exhibited high selectivity photoreduction of CO2 and strong water oxidation ability. Wang et al.43 proposed a hybrid photocatalyst for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to formate without sacrificial reagents with 0.08% conversion efficiency and 96% selectivity. However, to enhance the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction adequately, it is not required an efficient and robust photocatalyst but also a sustainable interfacial photocatalytic system. The diphase system of CO2 photoreduction has the limitations of CO2 and H2O capturing and mass transfer. The conversion of CO2 can be improved by adjusting the reactant molecular concentration on the catalyst surface with the triphase system.44 However, there are few studies on photocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol with multicomponent heterojunction photocatalysts in triphase systems.
Herein, we propose a method to prepare the multicomponent heterojunction photocatalysts by adjusting the local medium dielectric constant of plasmonic (Cu, Ni, and TiN) nanoparticles45,46 in terms of promoting light absorption and extending the photogenerated carrier lifetime of the multicomponent heterojunction photocatalysts. In the three-phase interface system, the photoreduction of CO2 to methanol as the major product at low temperature (90 °C) is realized, which is 50 times that of the two-phase system. The evolution of methanol of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is 25.8 μmol (h gcat.)−1, about 173 times enhancement compared to the STO counterpart. Moreover, it can be found that various plasmonic materials (Cu, Ni, and TiN) improved the reactivity impact of the heterojunction photocatalysts. And the role of TiN is an important effect in retaining the temperature of the triphase system. The temperature of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is 13 °C higher than that of STO/Cu@Ni. The results have verified that the thermal effect of plasmonic TiN can further improve the evolution of photocatalytic CO2 and H2O reduction to methanol. STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is designed and prepared by a simple co-precipitation which improved the defect of photocatalyst in the previous study (Yu et al.).39 The pathway of photocatalytic CO2 to methanol is verified using in situ FTIR and 13C isotope tracing tests. This work provides new ideas for stable and efficient photoreduction of CO2 to methanol as the major product at low temperature.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of photocatalysts
Preparation of STO/CuO@NiO nanoparticles. SrTiO3 (La, Cr) nanoparticles and Ni MOF ultrasonic were synthesized in the previous report.45 STO/CuO@NiO was prepared by co-precipitation. In detail, 0.192 g STO powders were dispersed in 300 mL ethanol (Nanjing Reagent, 99%). 0.4 g copper acetate monohydrate (Aladdin Industrial Corporation, 99.9%) was dissolved in 100 mL ethanol. 0.038 g Ni MOF ultrasonic was dispersed in 100 mL ultrapure water. 1.32 g Na2CO3 (Sinopharm, 99%) was dissolved in 100 mL ultrapure water. STO/CuO@NiO was then prepared by titration coprecipitation. Then the precipitate was washed and dried. And the powders were calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 2 hours. The powders were milled for 1 hour with a planetary ball mill at 400 rpm min−1. The STO/CuO@NiO nanoparticles were obtained.
Preparation of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2 nanoparticles. 0.23 g STO/CuO@NiO powders were dispersed in 40 mL ethanol. 4 mL ultrapure water and 5 mL 4.2 M ammonia were added to the mixture. 5 mL of 28% tetrabutyl silicate (TEOS) solution (Aladdin Industrial Corporation, 99.99%) was added to the mixture. Then the mixture was heated in a water bath at 70 °C for 4 hours. The powders were calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 2 hours. The powders were milled for 1 hour with a planetary ball mill of 400 rpm min−1. STO/CuO@NiO/SiO2 powders were reduced in H2 at 650 °C for 4 h. The STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2 nanoparticles were obtained.
The composite STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN was obtained by impregnation and vacuum calcination at 300 °C by impregnating 0.242 g STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2 powder and 0.05 g TiN (Shanghai McLean Biochemical Co., Ltd, 99.9%).
2.2 Photoelectrochemical test
Firstly, 4 mg STO and STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN were ultrasonically dispersed in 500 μL ethanol, 50 μL of 5% Nafion mixture solution for 1.5 h (Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd, Nafion 117). Then 20 μL of the mixture was coated on 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 FTO glass and dried naturally.
The photoelectrochemical performance was tested using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, CH Instruments, Inc., USA) with a three-electrode quartz cell: an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a Pt counter electrode, and an as-prepared photoelectrode as a working electrode in 50 mL 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. Ar or CO2 were continuously bubbled into the cell throughout the whole test process.
2.3 Photocatalytic test
The photoconversion CO2 properties of different photocatalysts were examined in a quartz reactor (Fig. S9†) under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. 30 mg photocatalyst was uniformly dispersed on Φ 40 mm quartz fiber membrane equipped with the quartz reactor. Then the quartz fiber membrane is put into the quartz reactor. 5 mL ionic liquid (Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd, 99% 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide) solution (0.18 wt%) is added to the reactor. The gas entrances of the reactor were sealed with butyl plugs, and Argon gas was bubbled into the reactor for 60 minutes to ensure a complete anaerobic state in the reactor system, and the CO2 flow was continuously bubbled for 60 min before light irradiation. A 300 W Xe lamp (Microsolar 300, Beijing Perfect Lighting Technology Co., Ltd) was used as a light source and the irradiation intensity of the catalyst surface is 327 mW cm−2. After 4 h of light irradiation, the products of CO2 photoreduction were analyzed. Gaseous products over different photocatalysts were detected by the GC9720plus gas chromatography (GC, Zhejiang Fuli Analytical Instrument Co., Ltd China). And liquid products were detected by chromatography-mass spectrometry (Agilent, 7890B-5977B).
3. Results and discussion
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of different photocatalysts are shown in Fig. 1(a). The diffraction peaks of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN correspond to the characteristic diffraction peaks of SrTiO3 (PDF – #35-7034), Cu (PDF – #04-0836) and tin (PDF – # 38-1420), respectively. It is obvious from Fig. 1 that the introduction of SiO2 decreases the crystallinity of the composite photocatalyst STO/Cu/SiO2, STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2, and STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN. However, there are no obvious SiO2 characteristic peaks. The introduction of amorphous SiO2 resulted in a change in catalyst crystallinity. Similarly, there are no obvious characteristic peaks of Ni nanoparticles in XRD spectrums. The distribution of each component can be observed in the EDX mapping images of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN (Fig. S1†). The EDX spectrum of STO/Cu@Ni and STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is shown in Fig. S2.† The grain size of STO, Cu, and TiN obtained by the Scherrer formula is 23.1 nm, 29.9 nm, and 40 nm respectively. According to the TEM image (Fig. S2†), the size of SiO2 is 10–30 nm, and the average grain size of Ni is 8 nm. Fig. 1(b–d) are the TEM images of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN. It can be found from Fig. 1 and Fig. S1† that the STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN structure is similar to the previous report.39 However, the size of Cu@Ni and TiN nanoparticles changed, and the Cu@Ni nanostructure is surrounded by SiO2 nanoparticles, and then STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2 is surrounded by TiN nanoparticles. The morphologies of various catalysts are characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. S3.† According to the mapping diagram, it can be seen that the distribution of each component is relatively uniform (Fig. S1, ESI†). To further study the multicomponent heterojunction photocatalysts, some extra characterizations of the samples are conducted and the XPS and Raman spectra are illustrated in Fig. S4.† The detail can be found in the ESI.† The above characterization information proves that the preparation of the catalyst is completed according to the catalyst design scheme.

The optical absorption properties of the photocatalysts are characterized by UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra, as shown in Fig. 2(a). It can be found that optical absorption edge of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN has been extended from ultraviolet to visible light. Moreover, the optical absorption ability of the composite photocatalysts with plasmonic materials (Cu, Ni, and TiN) in visible and near-infrared light has also been greatly improved. Fig. S4(f)† indicates the bandgap of different photocatalysts by the Kubelka–Munk transformed functions. It can be found that the introduction of Cu@Ni and TiN nanoparticles is beneficial to decrease the bandgap of photocatalysts. This is mainly attributed to the LSPR effect of Cu, Ni, and TiN which enhances the light absorption of the photocatalyst. In particular, Fig. 2(b and c) exhibits that when the SiO2 is introduced, the light absorption of catalyst STO/Cu/SiO2 from 397 nm to 633 nm is significantly higher than that of catalyst STO/Cu. The optical absorption of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2 from 397 nm to 560 nm is higher than that of the STO/Cu@Ni catalyst. The characteristic plasmonic absorption peak of Cu and Cu@Ni nanoparticles is consistent with the previous reports.39 The reason for the above phenomenon is that the local medium dielectric constant of Cu and Cu@Ni non-noble plasmonic nanoparticles is changed by SiO2 nanoparticles which can enhance the characteristic absorption of non-noble plasmonic nanomaterials.47 The enhancement of light absorption has a significant impact on the evolution of products of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Although the light absorptivity of STO/Cu/SiO2 and STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2 for visible light and near-infrared light decreased, the full-spectrum solar absorptivity of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN still is as high as 88% after the introduction of TiN nanoparticles. The optical absorption and utilization of low-energy photons can improve the surface temperature of the photocatalysts.39 Yu et al.39 have found that the increase in the temperature of the photocatalyst surface is conducive to the reduction of CO2.

To explore the principle of the enhancement of light absorption of non-noble metal plasmonic nanomaterials (Cu, Ni nanoparticles), FDTD simulates the micro-nanometer scale electric field distribution of STO/Cu, STO/Cu/SiO2, STO/Cu@Ni, and STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2. The detailed model information can be found in Fig. S7 and Table S1.† Under the same solar irradiation, the electric field distribution of STO/Cu and STO/Cu/SiO2 is compared. Electric field intensity is enhanced at the interfaces of Cu–Cu nanoparticles and Cu–Ni nanoparticles when the SiO2 nanoparticles are introduced. It can be found that SiO2 can greatly enhance the light absorption of Cu nanoparticles which corresponds to the results shown in Fig. 2(b). Then, STO/Cu@Ni, and STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2 are simulated and compared. The simulation result is also consistent with the UV-Vis-NIR test result shown in Fig. 2(c). In summary, the experimental results and theoretical simulation imply the light absorption of non-noble metal plasmonic nanomaterials (Cu, Ni) is enhanced by changing the local medium dielectric constant.

Fig. 3(a and b) shows the photoluminescence spectra of different catalysts. The excitation wavelength is 375 nm. It is found from Fig. 3(a) that the photoluminescence (PL) intensity of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is the lowest. It indicates that the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers is suppressed by multicomponent heterojunctions effectively. It can also be found that the blue shift of the photoluminescence peak of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2 and STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is owed to SiO2. Moreover, compared with the PL spectrum of the catalyst in Fig. 3(b), it is found that when Ni does not exist, the PL intensity of STO/Cu, STO/Cu/SiO2, and STO/Cu/SiO2/TiN is high. It indicates that the photogenerated carriers in the photocatalyst cannot be effectively transferred to the surface of the photocatalyst. It can be concluded that the heterojunction of STO-Cu@Ni, Cu@Ni-SiO2, and Cu@Ni-TiN can effectively separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Then we can conclude that Cu@Ni nanoparticles are the separation center of photogenerated carriers and the reaction site in the system. Fig. 3(c) shows the decay curves of photogenerated carriers in STO and STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN. From the curves, it can be seen that the lifetime of photogenerated carriers has been significantly extended. And the photogenerated carrier lifetime of different photocatalysts is tested. As shown in Table 1, the average photogenerated carrier life in single catalyst STO is extended from 4.6 ns to 7.78 ns of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN The charge carrier lifetime is extended by 3.1 ns. The fitting results of photogenerated carrier lifetime show that the extension of the average photogenerated carrier lifetime in STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is that the lifetime of τ2 is the longest. It means that the longer distance of photogenerated carriers is transferred in the catalyst. Therefore, the longer the lifetime of photogenerated carriers in the photocatalyst, the more conducive to the photocatalytic reaction.

To test the interfacial charge separation efficiency of photocatalysts, it can be characterized by photoelectrochemical measurements. The transient photocurrent test results of STO and STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN are shown in Fig. 4. The photocurrent density of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is higher than that of STO, which reveals that the heterojunction of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN can effectively promote the generation and migration of photoelectrons. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) can characterize the charge transfer ability of photocatalysts. Fig. 4(b) shows that the radius of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is significantly smaller than that of STO, which reveals that the heterojunction can effectively reduce the resistance of interfacial charge separation.

To explore the performance of a new photocatalyst and a three-phase interface system for the photoreduction of CO2 to methanol, experiments are carried out under the irradiation of the 300 W Xe lamp with the incident light intensity of 3.27 kW m−2. Firstly, this study explored the influence of each component on the product type and the evolution of products in the process of photothermal coupling catalytic CO2 reduction performance, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The reaction condition is the gas–liquid–solid triphase reaction. The temperature of the photocatalysts is measured by a K-type thermocouple, and the reaction medium is 0.18 wt% ionic liquid aqueous solution. In the triphase interfacial system, the temperature of STO, STO/Cu@Ni, and STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN nanoparticles under illumination are 71 °C, 77 °C, and 90 °C. The temperature of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is 19 °C higher than that of STO/Cu@Ni. Therefore, the LSPR effect of TiN nanoparticles plays an important role in remaining the temperature of the photocatalysts in the triphase interfacial systems. The results have verified that the thermal effect of plasmonic TiN can further improve the evolution of photocatalytic CO2 and H2O reduction to methanol. All products are detected, including CH3OH, C2H5OH, CH4, and CO. Fig. 5a shows that the main product of STO/Cu@Ni is ethanol, and the yield of methanol is 9.75 μmol g−1. While the main product of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2 is methanol, and its yield is 76.9 μmol g−1. The result of the control experiments shows that the introduction of SiO2 can greatly enhance the yield of methanol. Furthermore, we can find that the introduction of TiN can further improve the yield of methanol. Meanwhile, the main product of STO, STO/Cu, and STO/Cu@Ni is ethanol. And the main product of STO/Cu/SiO2, STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2, and STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN becomes methanol. The reason for this phenomenon is that the Cu@Ni interface is the C–C coupling reaction site in the product ethanol which has been confirmed in previous research (Yu et al.).39 According to the previous research39 STO and TiN provide photogenerated carriers, while Cu, Ni, and TiN can provide hot electrons for the photocatalytic system. However, the introduction of SiO2 nanoparticles leads to the Cu@Ni interface being covered, the C–C coupling reaction is inhibited. Then the main product of photocatalytic CO2 reduction is changed. The evolution of methanol obtained by photocatalytic CO2 reduction of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is the highest. Through the analysis of Fig. 5(a) and 3, it can be concluded that the reaction site of photocatalytic CO2 reduction is the Cu@Ni interface. According to Fig. 2, SiO2 can significantly enhance the light absorption of Cu and Ni nanoparticles. Then the number of hot electrons produced by Cu@Ni and TiN nanoparticles in the STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN photocatalyst is increased, and the selectivity and evolution of methanol are significantly improved. Fig. 5(b) verifies the way reactant supplied can change the selectivity and evolution of products. It can be found that the evolution of methanol in a single reaction way is much lower than that in a gas–liquid–solid three-phase reaction under the same condition. The reason is that there is serious competitive hydrogen evolution in liquid–solid reactions, the capture of CO2 molecules on the catalyst surface has become the main reason for limiting the progress of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol. However, the difficulty of mass transfer on the surface of the photocatalyst is the reason for limiting the photocatalytic efficiency. In the gas–liquid–solid reaction mode, the surface temperature of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is 90 °C. It can accelerate the desorption of water. Thus, high-efficiency photocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol can be achieved. Fig. 5(d) shows the stability test of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN in CO2 conversion. In this process, the mass of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN photocatalyst is 120 mg. The reaction time is 4 hours. After each cycle, it is necessary to wash the photocatalysts with slow ultra-pure water flow until the conductivity of the cleaning solution is zero. Then the photocatalyst is put into a 60 °C oven for drying. After five cycles, the performance of the photocatalyst still maintained high activity. Fig. S5† shows the products of the photocatalyst STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN under different reaction conditions, and it can be found that 0.18% ionic liquid is the major agent for the huge CH3OH formation. The most likely reason is that ionic liquid can adsorb and activate CO2 molecules,48 which reduces the activation energy. Thus, the formation of methanol is accelerated.

To verify the pathway of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol, STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is analyzed by in situ FTIR spectroscopy in a closed reaction chamber. As shown in Fig. 6, the types and contents of intermediates and adsorbents products on STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN photocatalyst in the CO2 reduction process are confirmed. In this process, the background spectra are collected in the dark. Then the spectral signals after CO2 gas and 0.18% ionic liquid are collected respectively. And 300 W Xe lamp is used as the light source. And the spectra are collected every 10 min. COOH*49,50 is proved at the band of 1390–1530 cm−1. The linearly adsorbed CO*51 is proved at the band of 2130 cm−1. The band at 1095 cm−1 is the characteristic peak of CHO*,52 which first increases and then decreases with the extension of solar radiation time. And the band at 2868 cm−1 is the characteristic peak of CH3O*.53 The band at 2958 cm−1 is the characteristic peak of CH3*.54 The intensity of the peak increases as the extension of light irradiation time. The band of 3090–3690 cm−1 is the characteristic peak of OH−. The six key redox of CO2 reduction to methanol on the surface of STO/Cu@Ni/SiO2/TiN is just as eqn (1)–(6). To prove that the product comes from CO2, the isotope tracing experiment is carried out in this study. The mass spectrum of methanol was found in Fig. S8.† CO2* + H+ + e− → COOH*(1) COOH* + H+ + e− → CO* + H2O(2) CO* + H+ + e− → CHO*(3) CHO* + H+ + e− → HCHO*(4) HCHO* + H+ + e− → CH3O*(5) CH3O* + H+ + e− → CH3OH(6)

4. Conclusions

Efficient and stable photoreduction of CO2 and H2O to methanol as the major product by utilizing the triphase reaction system. The local medium dielectric constant regulation of non-noble metal nanoparticles for enhancing the light absorption of the photocatalyst for the full solar spectrum. Moreover, multicomponent heterostructure can extend the lifetime of charge carriers. At the same time, the efficiency of photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to methanol is significantly improved by the triphase interfacial system 50 times compared with the diphase interfacial system. And the ionic liquids can effectively increase the output of methanol. In this work, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol as the major product with low cost and high efficiency at 90 °C is realized. Meanwhile, the in situ FTIR spectroscopy and 13C isotope labeling test verify the pathway of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to methanol. The research provides some new ideas for the design of photocatalysts and the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH.
