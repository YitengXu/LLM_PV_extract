    , Accepted 17th October 2022First published on 17th October 2022AbstractCopper zinc tin sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) is attracting interest in photovoltaic applications due to its proper band gap, low cost and low toxicity. It has been found that two phases can be fabricated, i.e. kesterite and wurtzite CZTS structures. Though kesterite CZTS is proven to be thermodynamically stable, the free energy difference between kesterite and wurtzite CZTS is rather small. So, wurtzite CZTS can also stably exist under ambient conditions. Controlling the phase formation can expand the dimensions to optimize the performance of applications based on CZTS. In this study, we found that phase control can be achieved by simply using a mixed solvent of ethylene glycol and triethylenetetramine (TETA) in a two-stage heating process. It is found that the incorporation of the reductive solvent of TETA during the 1st heating process converts the phase of the precipitates from CuS (TETA poor) to Cu7S4 (TETA rich). In the subsequent 2nd heating stage, the phase of the final products is determined to be kesterite CZTS originating from CuS and wurtzite CZTS from Cu7S4, respectively. Thus, the key to control the phases of the final products is to control the chemical environment of Cu under Cu1+-rich or Cu2+-rich conditions in the fabrication process, which corresponds to the phase of the final products of wurtzite CZTS or kesterite CZTS, respectively. This summarized principle can not only be used to explain the previous versatile experimental results but also to guide the controlled synthesis of various phases of CZTS and CZTS-like materials in applications.
Introduction
In recent years, increasing energy demands and environmental problems have driven many researchers to search for highly efficient and cost-effective solar cells. As a direct-gap semiconductor, copper zinc tin sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) has attracted considerable attention as an ideal absorber candidate for thin film solar cells because of their low toxicity, earth abundance of the constituent elements, desirable direct band-gap of about 1.5 eV, and high absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1) in the visible wavelength region.1 An increasing efficiency of over 12% was achieved for solar cells based on CZTS (CZTSSe) cells, which has greatly drawn considerable attention to its application in the field of thin film solar cells.2–5
Both theoretical calculation and experimental work have indicated that CZTS crystallizes mainly in two typical crystal structures: kesterite and wurtzite phases, while stannite-structured CZTS was occasionally reported.6 Most common CZTS-based nanoparticles exhibit thermodynamically stable kesterite structure with tetragonal lattice, which can be considered as a derivative of the cubic zinc blende ZnS structure.7–11 Different from stable kesterite CZTS (K-CZTS), metastable wurtzite CZTS (W-CZTS) features a hexagonal crystalline structure derived from the wurtzite ZnS structure.12,13 In this structure, sulfur anions are hexagonally close packed; Cu(I), Zn(II) and Sn(IV) cations occupy a half of the interstices of the sulfur anions.14
It is well-known that the size, shape and structure of the semiconductors significantly determine their optical and electrical properties which in turn could affect photovoltaic device performance. For example, kesterite structure CZTS is generally considered as the best candidate for photovoltaic applications,13 and it has been reported that thin film solar cells based on K-CZTS and W-CZTS exhibited the best conversion efficiency of 12.6% and 4.3%, respectively.2 However, better results would be obtained with W-CZTS in the photocatalysis field. J. Kong et al. reported that a dye-sensitized solar cell with a W-CZTS counter electrode generated higher power conversion efficiency (6.89%) than K-CZTS (4.89%) counter electrodes.15 Thus, it is significant to control the synthesis of CZTS with different phases, which contributes to the development of high-efficient, yet low-cost solar cells. Density functional theory studies show that the difference in the formation energies between the kesterite and wurtzite phases of CZTS is only ∼5 kJ mol−1,2,16 and it is a challenge to obtain pure phase CZTS in experiments.
So far, a variety of synthetic routes, such as hot injection, solvothermal and one-pot approaches, were used to synthesize phase-controlled CZTS nanoparticles. In the hot-injection process of Cattley et al.,17 colloidal CZTS nanocrystals with different structures and morphologies were influenced by the reaction temperature. Zhou et al.18 reported the phase-selective synthesis of CZTS nanocrystals by controlling the concentrations of sulfur and 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) in the hot-injection reaction, which were used as sulfur sources of CZTS. Zhang et al. described the preparation of CZTS nanoparticles through structural transformation from kesterite to wurtzite by varying the volumetric ratios of oleylamine (OAm) and ethanediamine.19 However, the above-mentioned hot-injection synthetic procedure often needs (or uses/requires) toxic and costly organic solvents, such as OAm, 1-octadecene (ODE) and DDT and inert gas protection (nitrogen or argon). The major shortcomings of the hydrothermal method are the lack of good control over particle size, morphology, and monodispersity of the products and a relatively long reaction time (over 12 h). Sun et al. used a top-down strategy to selectively synthesize W-CZTS and K-CZTS by tuning the pH of a hydrothermal method.20 Li et al. synthesized CZTS nanocrystals using a mixture of OAm and DDT and controlled the crystal structure by adjusting the OAm to DDT ratio, but failed to obtain CZTS with the kesterite pure phase.11 It has been reported that the shapes and structures can be strongly influenced by various factors, such as the nature of reactant and solvents,21,22 reactant concentration,23 the reaction temperature and time. Interestingly, K-CZTS can be synthesized by using complexes at room temperature.24 Nevertheless, the mechanism of the phase selection was not well understood.
In the present work, a simple and environmentally friendly heat-up method was described to prepare CZTS nanoparticles under atmospheric conditions by a two-stage heating process. By simply tuning the solvent composition, kesterite, wurtzite, mixed kesterite and wurtzite type CZTS were obtained. The amount of TETA in the reaction solvents plays an important role in the phase-selective synthesis process. It is found that the phase of the precipitates after the 1st heating stage is highly correlated with the final structure of CZTS. The addition of a reductive solvent can convert the CuS phase to the Cu7S4 phase, and finally results in the conversion of K-CZTS to W-CZTS. The reductive solvent-controlled phase selective synthesis principle is not limited to the current solvent recipe and can be applied to many other cases to explain the previous versatile experimental results. The reductive solvent-induced phase selective synthesis is also not limited to CZTS and can be applied to CZTS-like materials such as Cu2XSnS4 (X = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni). Our results show the general importance of the chemical environment of Cu in controlling the phases of CZTS during the synthesis process and it can be used to guide the phase-controlled synthesis of CZTS and CZTS-like materials in future applications.
Experimental section
Chemical reagents
Copper(II) chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O, Alfa Aesar, 99%), zinc(II) acetate dihydrate (Zn(Ac)2·2H2O, Alfa Aesar, 97+%), tin(II) chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, Alfa Aesar, 98%), tin(IV) chloride pentahydrate (SnCl4·5H2O, Alfa Aesar, 98%), iron(III) chloride (FeCl3, Aladdin, 98%), manganese(II) acetate dihydrate (Mn(Ac)2·2H2O, Aladdin, 98%), cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Co(Ac)2·4H2O, Aladdin, 98%), nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(Ac)2·4H2O, Aladdin, 98%), oleylamine (Aladdin, 80–90%), 1-octadecene (Aladdin, >90%), thiourea (CN2H4S, Aladdin, 99.95%), triethylenetetramine (TETA, Aladdin, 68%), ethylene glycol (EG, Analytical reagent), and ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 99.7%) were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of CZTS nanoparticles
For a typical preparation, 4 mmol of CuCl2·2H2O, 2.5 mmol of Zn(Ac)2·2H2O, 2 mmol of SnCl2·2H2O and 12 mmol of thiourea were dissolved in a mixed solution composed of TETA and EG (various ratios) in a three-necked flask under magnetic stirring. A two-stage heating process was employed to obtain CZTS nanoparticles. In the 1st stage, the well-mixed solution was heated to 130 °C. The temperature was maintained at 130 °C for 30 min. In the following 2nd stage, the mixture was heated up to the reaction temperature of 200 °C and kept for 2 h. After the reaction was complete, the flask was removed from the hotplate and allowed to naturally cool to room temperature. The product was separated by centrifugation and washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, followed by drying at 60 °C. The whole experiment was carried out under atmosphere without any gas protection. For the intermediate states of the products, the 2nd heating stage time was varied from 0 min to 4 hours. For other CZTS-like materials, the corresponding reagents with the same molar concentration were used.
Characterization
The structure and phase purity of the as-prepared CZTS microcrystals were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker-D8ADVANCE) in the 2θ range from 10° to 90° using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The morphological and stoichiometric analyses of the elements were performed by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi-SU4500 or Hitachi-SU8000) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Room temperature Raman spectra were recorded using a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw, RM-1000) with a laser source of (λ = 633 nm, 600 mW). The UV-vis absorbance spectra were obtained by using a Hitachi-UV4100 spectrophotometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed by using an FEI Tecnai G2 TF30. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a PHI Versaprobe-II. The scanning step is set to 0.05 eV. All tests were performed at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Solvent engineering of the phases of CZTS nanocrystals
The influence of solvent on the phase of CZTS nanocrystals was systematically studied by using EG and TETA, which were mixed in five ratios, i.e. EG:TETA in 39:1, 35:5, 30:10. 20:20, and 5:35 with a total of 40 mL in our experiments. Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns from which a phase evolution from K-CZTS to W-CZTS can be clearly identified. For an EG:TETA ratio of 39:1, the major strong peaks appear at 22.88°, 28.48°, 33.06°, 47.36°, and 56.18°, which are assigned to the (110), (112), (200), (220), and (312) planes of tetragonal K-CZTS (JCPDS card, no. 26-0575), respectively. With the increase in the TETA component, two major peaks (26.96° and 30.52°) around the 28.48° K-CZTS peak gradually increase. Two peaks located at 39.64° and 51.78° gradually appear, which can be attributed to W-CZTS.

(d) and (e) The high-resolution TEM images of (b) and (c). 
To consolidate the phase evolution process, TEM and HR-TEM were performed. Fig. 1(b) and (c) show the morphologies of the K-CZTS (Fig. 1(b)) and W-CZTS (Fig. 1(c)) nanocrystals. It is shown that the K-CZTS nanoparticles have a size of about 300 nm and some nanosheets are visible at the edge of the particles. The high resolution TEM images (Fig. 1(d)) show that the lattice spacing is 0.31 nm, corresponding to the (112) plane of the K-CZTS, indicating that the K-CZTS is along the (112) direction. For the W-CZTS nanocrystals, the morphology is similar to that of K-CZTS except the size is small (about 120 nm). The lattice spacing is 0.33 nm and corresponds to the spacing along the (100) plane (Fig. 1(e)).
Raman spectroscopy was employed to detect the existence of the secondary phases. As can be seen from Fig. S1,† the main peak moves from 334.2 cm−1 (pure K-CZTS) to 329.9 cm−1 (pure W-CZTS). Except for the above-mentioned Raman peaks, no noticeable peaks for other phases such as ZnS (350 cm−1),25 SnS (196 cm−1, 217 cm−1, 353 cm−1),26 CuS (472 cm−1),27 Cu2S (475 cm−1),28 Cu2SnS3 (336 cm−1, 351 cm−1)29 and Cu3SnS4 (318 cm−1, 348 cm−1, 295 cm−1)30,31 are found, which suggests that the single phase of the CZTS nanocrystals were obtained by our method, which is consistent with the results of XRD measurements.
The morphology was further checked by SEM measurements. Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of CZTS nanocrystals with an EG:TETA ratio ranging from 39:1 to 5:35. It is found that the K-CZTS nanoparticles obtained with an EG:TETA ratio of 39:1 are very similar to those K-CZTS nanoparticles prepared by chemical solution combined with microwave irradiation.32 From the SEM images (Fig. 2(a)), it is found that the products are spherical nanoparticles with a diameter of about 280–500 nm, and there are many 50–150 nm fine flakes on the surface of the spherical particles, similar to cactus. When the EG:TETA is 35:5, the synthesized CZTS is composed of three-dimensional flower-like spherical microcrystalline particles with a diameter of about 300–500 nm and the size is relatively uniform. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 2(b) that the single flower-like particles are formed with petal-like nano-tablets as the basic units aggregate together. The thickness of the nano-tablets is about 10 nm, and the surface is relatively smooth. When the amount of TETA in the solvent was further increased to 10 mL, as shown in Fig. 2(c), the CZTS particles mainly consist of three-dimensional flower-like spherical microcrystalline particles with a single flower grain size of about 200–500 nm and a thicker petal thickness relative to that of CZTS with an EG:TETA ratio of 35:5. The thickness of the petals was about 25 nm and the surface smoothness was decreased. When the amount of TETA was increased to 20 mL, the size of the CZTS particles greatly decreases to 80–150 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The petal feature disappears. When the amount of TETA was increased to 35 mL, the size of the CZTS particles increases to 300–450 nm again. On the surface of the CZTS particles, smaller nanocrystals can be grown on large nano-plates. The above results show that the composition of the solvent has a significant effect on the size and morphology of the CZTS nanoparticles.

XPS measurements were performed to probe the chemical states of the elements in CZTS nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 3. The high-resolution XPS spectrum suggests that both bonding energy and peak splitting for the four constituent elements of K-CZTS and W-CZTS nanoparticles are the same. As can be seen in Fig. 3(a), the core level peaks at 932.20 eV (Cu 2p 3/2) and 952.00 eV (Cu 2p 1/2) are indicative of Cu1+ with a peak energy splitting of 19.80 eV, which is consistent with the standard separation of 19.90 eV. The well-resolved doublet 2p peaks of 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 at binding energies 1021.58 eV and 1044.69 eV, respectively, with a peak energy splitting of 23.11 eV confirm the presence of Zn2+ (Fig. 3(b)). The typical Sn 3d peaks located at 486.80 (3d 5/2) and 495.22 eV (3d 3/2) and a peak energy splitting of 8.42 eV indicates that Sn configuration (Fig. 3(c)) is consistent with the reported value for Sn4+.33 From Fig. 3(d), two peaks observed at 161.60 eV and 162.82 eV, respectively, should be assigned for the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of the S 2p binding energy, which are in good agreement with the 160–164 eV expected for S in the sulfide phases (with a valence of −2). The above results indicated that the chemical states of the component elements are +1 for Cu, +2 for Zn, +4 for Sn, and −2 for S, respectively, further confirming the phase purity of the synthesized materials.

Selective phase formation of CZTS nanocrystals with solvent composition
To further understand the synthesis mechanism of the kesterite and wurtzite phase CZTS nanocrystals, a study on phase evolution with the heating time during the 2nd stage was carried out for the cases of 39:1 and 20:20 of EG:TETA ratios as their products are typical K-CZTS and W-CZTS, respectively. The intermediate states of CZTS were identified by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. The XRD patterns of the intermediate states are shown in Fig. 4(a). After the 130 °C treatment, the phase of the precipitate is CuS. The atomic structure is shown in Fig. S2(a).† This phase continues to exist until after heating at 200 °C for 2 hours. After the 2 hour treatment, only pure K-CZTS can be identified. All the CuS nanocrystals were transformed into the K-CZTS phase. This is a rather slow reaction process, which is confirmed by the Raman result shown in Fig. 4(b). The Raman peaks at around 470 cm−1 exist until heating for 2 hours. The Raman peaks at around 330 cm−1 that belong to CZTS appear after heating for a short time (<30 min). From the SEM images of the intermediate states shown in Fig. 4(c)–(h), it is known that the as-synthesized CuS nanocrystals are uniform square particles with an average size of about 50 nm. After 5 min of treatment, the average size of the nanocrystals increases to about 200 nm. The shape of the nanocrystals is plate-like. It is noticed that K-CZTS was not formed yet. When the heating time reaches 30 min, the petal feature appears on the flat nanoplates, while the average size of the nanoplates does not change apparently. When the heating time is increased further, the petal feature develops further and is stable after 2 hours of heating. The morphology is very similar to that of Cu2SnS3.34 The average size of the nanocrystals increases to about 400 nm after heating for 2 hours. The composition of the nanocrystals also shows a consistent trend as shown in Fig. 4(i). The ratio of Cu decreases greatly as other elements start to precipitate. The ratios of the other two metal elements increase greatly in 2 hours, and the precipitation speed of Sn is faster than that of Zn. The S ratio shows similar trends, while it shows a peak when heated for 1 hour.

The heating times (c)–(h) are 0 min (c), 5 min (d), 30 min (e),1 hour (f), 2 hours (g) and 4 hours (h), respectively. 
For the case of EG:TETA in a ratio of 20:20, it is observed that after 130° treatment, the precipitates are in the Cu7S4 phase (Fig. 5(a)), whose structure is shown in Fig. S2(b).† Apparently, the valence of Cu is reduced from +2 in CuCl2 in the 1st heating stage. After heating for 5 min, the phase does not change. However, after heating for 30 min, the features of Cu7S4 disappear from the XRD spectra. The XRD peaks are consistent with those of W-CZTS, while two peaks at around 31° and 48°, which do not belong to W-CZTS and Cu7S4, indicate that a new phase is gradually being formed. After checking the Raman spectra (Fig. 5(b)), the feature Raman peak at 315.5 cm−1 appearing after heating for 30 min corresponds to that of Cu3SnS4 (PDF #36-0217).30,31,35 The peak at 333.7 cm−1 gradually emerges, which indicates the transformation of Cu3SnS4 into W-CZTS. The atomic structure of Cu3SnS4 is shown in Fig. S2(c).† We can conclude that in the initial 2nd heating stage, the orthorhombic Cu3SnS4 phase is preferably formed. After that the W-CZTS phase is formed. It is noticed that the transition from Cu7S4 to Cu3SnS4 is a very fast process than the transition from CuS to K-CZTS in the previous case. The morphology shows distinct features (Fig. 5(c)–(h)). For the as-synthesized Cu7S4, the average size is about 65 nm, which is larger than the previous case. In the following heating process, only the size of nanocrystals gradually increases as the heating time elongates and no other feature appears. After heating for 2 hours, the average size of the nanocrystals is about 110 nm. The Cu ratio during the evolution shows a great decrease with heating time, which is similar to the previous case, as shown in Fig. 5(i). Zn is also the slowest component to incorporate into W-CZTS in the synthesis process. The slow Zn incorporation confirms the existence of Cu3SnS4 during the initial heating time of the 2nd heating stage. It is interesting to notice that the ratio of Sn shows a peak after 1 hour of heating, which is higher than the final Sn ratio. This result indicates that the diffusion of Cu out of Cu3SnS4 is a fast process, which is evidenced by comparing the curves of Cu ratio along with the heating time as shown in Fig. 4(i) and 5(i). In contrast, the diffusion of Zn is rather slower than in the case of EG:TETA = 39:1. The fast loss of Cu and slow compensation of Zn result in an Sn ratio after heating for 60 min which is higher than the final Sn ratio. The final ratio of Sn is similar to the previous case.

The heating times for (c)–(h) are 0 min (c), 5 min (d), 30 min (e), 1 hour (f), 2 hours (g) and 4 hours (h), respectively. 
Formation mechanism of K-CZTS and W-CZTS nanocrystals
As seen from the experimental results, two different formation modes can be observed for the formation of the K-CZTS and W-CZTS phases, respectively. After 130° treatment, different precipitates are present for TETA-poor and TETA-rich cases, respectively. Though the valence of Cu in CuS is in debate,36,37 the average valence of Cu in CuS (1/3 in Cu(II))38 is considerably higher than that in Cu7S4 (1/7 in Cu(II)). This indicates that EG cannot efficiently reduce Cu, while TETA is an efficient reductant for Cu at relatively low temperatures (such as 130°). Due to different precipitates obtained at low temperature, the synthesis modes are different correspondingly. For the TETA-poor case, during the initial stage, no CZTS phase is formed, which indicates that the Cu in the solution continues to be precipitated and the nanocrystals are enlarged with epitaxial growth of CuS. Upon high Cu consumption, the petals appear, which marks the apparently newly grown phase and is mostly possible to be the K-CZTS phase. At the same time, Sn, Zn, and S continue to precipitate on and diffuse into pre-grown CuS nanocrystals, which are converted into K-CZTS. In such a case, because the Cu2+ needs to be in situ reduced to Cu1+, a reaction barrier is needed to be overcome. So the process is relatively slow, which is consistent with the experimental results. Besides, the existence of S–S covalent bonds in CuS (Fig. S2(a)†) needs to be broken to form CZTS, which further decreases the reaction speed.
For the TETA-rich case, TETA can efficiently reduce Cu2+ to Cu1+, so that Cu7S4 can be formed. After 130 °C treatment, almost all Cu2+ ions are reduced to Cu1+, so that during the initial 2nd heating stage the size of the Cu7S4 nanocrystals changes a little. The fast Sn4+ diffusion into Cu7S4 nanocrystals converts them into Cu3SnS4, which is evidenced by the fast increase in the Sn ratio for both the TETA-poor and TETA-rich cases during the 2nd heating stage.39 It is noticed that the atomic structure of Cu3SnS4 is similar to the atomic structure of W-CZTS. Because of the lower valence of Cu, no reduction reaction for Cu is necessary and the formation process of CZTS is much faster than the TETA-poor case when compared to the decay of the Cu component as shown in Fig. 4(b) and 5(b). Finally, only the ion exchange of Zn to Cu is needed to convert into W-CZTS at higher temperatures.39 So the presence of Cu7S4 is crucial for the subsequent formation of W-CZTS.
From the above analysis, the formation mechanism of K-CZTS and W-CZTS by solvent engineering can be summarized in Fig. 6. The addition of the reductive solvent promotes the changes in the phase of the low temperature precipitates from CuS toCu7S4. Based on the initial precipitates, the final phases of CZTS evolve into K-CZTS with less reductive solvent and W-CZTS with more reductive solvent. This conclusion is also evidenced by the results of comparing the final products fabricated with various solvents. As shown in Fig. 7, W-CZTS can also be made by using other reductive solvents, such as ODE and OAm. In fact, in literature, a similar principle can also be found. In a one-pot solvothermal synthesis, by adding a reductive solvent, i.e. ethylenediamine, W-CZTS was obtained.40 By using the reductive solvents ODE, OAm or an ODE/OAm mixture as the solvent, W-CZTS was obtained.39,41,42 In the hydrothermal method, by using inert water and reductive OAm as solvents, K-CZTS43 and W-CZTS7,11 were obtained, respectively. By using mixed OA and OAm, a mixture of K-CZTS and W-CZTS was obtained17 because of the involvement of the reductive solvent OAm. Simply by using OA as the solvent at low reaction temperatures K-CZTS was obtained and at high reaction temperatures W-CZTS was obtained.44 It is understandable that the reductive activity of a reductant is more efficient at higher temperatures. In our experiments, if we lower the 2nd-stage heating temperature, unlike in the case of OA solvent, only the W-CZTS phase was obtained as shown in Fig. S3.† This comparison consolidates our proposed formation mechanism illustrated in Fig. 6. Besides reductive solvents, any reductive agent that is compatible with the process may be added to the precursor solution to make W-CZTS, while inert solvents may lead to the synthesis of K-CZTS.

In most literature, Cu2+, such as CuCl2, was used as the Cu source.45 Due to the change in the chemical valence of Cu from +2 to +1 to form CZTS, a redox reaction has to take place as discussed previously. Under such conditions, the reductive solvent plays a critical role in determining the phases of the final products. If a Cu source with +1 chemical valence is used, no redox reaction is needed to obtain Cu1+. According to the previous discussion, W-CZTS is preferred to be formed. In the experiments, we indeed obtained W-CZTS when using CuI as the Cu source and obtained K-CZTS when using CuCl2·2H2O as the Cu source despite the valence of Sn being +2 or +4 as shown in Fig. 8.
 Fig. 8  The XRD patterns of CZTS products obtained from the 2-stage heating process upon using SnCl2·2H2O + CuCl2·2H2O, SnCl4·5H2O + CuI, and SnCl4·5H2O + CuCl2·2H2O in a solvent with an EG:TETA ratio of 35:5. 
Besides the solvent, the elemental sulfur source can also be used to tune the chemical environment of Cu by utilizing its oxidativity. Taking elemental sulfur as the S source, even if Cu1+ was taken as the Cu source, Cu2+ generated by S oxidation may exist widely and thus K-CZTS is dominant in the final products. In their research, Wang et al. reported that the use of elemental sulfur and DDT as S sources can synthesize K-CZTS and W-CZTS, respectively, when using CuCl as the Cu source.46 Zheng and Liu reported the use of ammonium thioglycolate and L-cysteine as the S source in water. Due to the existence of the primary amine group in L-cysteine, i.e. reductive environment, the phase of the final product was W-CZTS, while for the use of ammonium thioglycolate, i.e. relative inert environment, K-CZTS was obtained.47 Zhou et al. used S as the sulfur source to obtain K-CZTS, though TETA was taken as the solvent.48 These results are consistent with our summarized general principle.
According to the above results, it is reasonable to extend the above formation mechanism to a more general principle, such that the key to controlling the phase of the products is the chemical environment of Cu. If Cu1+ is easy to be obtained (in a reductive environment with Cu(II) source or an inert environment with Cu(I) source), W-CZTS is dominant in the final products. If Cu2+ is easy to be obtained (in an inert environment with Cu(II) source or an oxidative environment with Cu(I) source), K-CZTS is dominant in the final products.
In fact, not only for CZTS but also for CZTS-like materials such as Cu2MnSnS4, Cu2FeSnS4, Cu2CoSnS4, and Cu2NiSnS4, the similar phase selective synthesis procedure was achieved by tuning the EG:TETA ratio as observed from the comparison of the XRD patterns shown in Fig. S4.† This result indicates the general validation of our proposed principle in CZTS-like materials.
In our experiments, we used a two-stage heating process to fabricate pure phase CZTS. In fact, the division of the heating process into two steps does not influence the formation of W-CZTS but depends on the solvent composition. As shown in Fig. S5,† the XRD patterns and SEM images of CZTS fabricated by one-stage and two-stage heating processes were compared and it is found that all the final products are composed of W-CZTS. However, the size of W-CZTS obtained by the one-stage heating process is a little larger and the uniformity is worse than those of W-CZTS obtained by the two-stage heating process, which manifests the importance of the low temperature heating stage in obtaining high-quality CZTS nanocrystals.49 This result confirms the importance of a reductive environment in the formation of W-CZTS in the presence of Cu(II).
Conclusions
In summary, the phase evolution of CZTS during the two-stage heating process was systematically studied. It is found that the phase selection of K-CZTS and W-CZTS can be controlled by tuning the composition of the solvent. Based on the experimental results, it is concluded that a reductive chemical environment determines the formation of K-CZTS or W-CZTS. In general, the dominating species of Cu (Cu(I) or Cu(II)) in the precursor determines the phase of the final product (W-CZTS or K-CZTS). This correspondence principle can not only be used to explain the reported versatile experimental results but also guide the controlled synthesis of various phases of CZTS and CZTS-like materials in future applications.
