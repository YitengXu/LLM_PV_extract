    , Accepted 21st August 2021First published on 23rd August 2021AbstractPrussian blue materials have been considered as ideal cathodes for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) because of their unique open framework structure. Among those, nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) with “zero strain” characteristics is of peculiar interest. In this work, large-size, multi-edge structured Na-rich NiHCF was prepared via a controlled coprecipitation method. At 25 °C, the NiHCF exhibits extremely stable cycling with 90.4% capacity retained after 16000 cycles at 20C (1C = 85 mA g−1). Besides, the material shows superior rate capability with 78.5% capacity yielded at 50C relativ to 0.2C. The material also exhibits stable cycling under stringent conditions, namely, at high/low temperatures and after overcharge/overdischarge abuse. High capacity retentions, 95.5% over 600 cycles at 60 °C and 91.9% over 1800 cycles at −20 °C, are achieved for this material after being cycled at 5C. After overcharge to 4.8 V and overdischarge to 1.2 V, the NiHCF can still exhibit good cycling stability with both the structure and capacity recovered in the normal voltage window. The NiHCF also demonstrates a long cycle life in an aqueous NiHCF/Zn battery, maintaining 84.1% capacity after 3100 cycles at 5C. A scale-up preparation of kilogram-grade NiHCF was realized and pouch-type NiHCF/hard carbon full batteries were fabricated and evaluated to realize potential applications of the material.
Introduction
Promoting the development of renewable energy has become an urgent demand over the past few decades because of the energy crisis and environmental problems with the use of fossil fuels. However, renewable energy such as solar and wind energy needs to be harvested when available and stored until needed.1 Large-scale energy storage systems not only improve utilization of renewable energy but also adjust the output load of electric power systems to improve their reliability,2,3 and thus have gained a lot of attention for the rapid development of renewable energy.4–8 For large-scale energy storage, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise due to abundant and low-cost Na resources.9–11 Despite recent advancements, great challenges remain to find a suitable SIB cathode, which requires properties such as low cost, high safety, satisfactory chemical/electrochemical stability and good temperature adaptability.12–23 Among various candidates, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are particularly promising owing to the open framework structure and availability of diffusion channels for large-size Na ions.24–35
The general formula of PBAs can be written as AxM1[M2(CN)6]y□1−y·nH2O (0 < x ≤ 2, 0 < y < 1), where A is the alkali metal, M1 and M2 are the transition metals, and □ is the vacancy of M2(CN)6.36–42 In the PBA family, hexacyanoferrates (with a [Fe(CN)6] configuration) are of particular interest because of their high working voltages.43,44 Among hexacyanoferrates, nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) is peculiarly attractive because of its highly stable structure and “zero strain” ion-insertion characteristics.45,46 Given its unique structure, the NiHCF demonstrates excellent rate capability, long cycle life and high coulombic efficiency.46–48 However, the Ni element in NiHCF is electrochemically inactive, unlike Mn or Fe in MnHCF or FeHCF, resulting in a low theoretical capacity of NiHCF (85 mA h g−1) based on the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple.
Many strategies have been proposed to enhance the electrochemical activity of the Fe2+/Fe3+ couple, so as to increase the deliverable capacity of NiHCF. The work by Ji et al. showed that Na-rich rhombohedral-phase NiHCF exhibited a higher operation voltage, better cycling stability and rate capability than cubic-phase NiHCF.48 Selective etching was a useful method to enhance rate capability (71 mA h g−1 at 44.4C) and achieve high-rate (5.5C) cycling stability (83.2% retention after 5000 cycles) of NiHCF.49 Producing high-crystallinity, low-defect samples is another effective approach to improve the electrochemical properties of NiHCF, through slowing down the nucleation and growth rate using a chelating route.50 However, the long-term cycling performance of NiHCF is not satisfactory yet. In addition, for grid-scale applications, batteries should be capable of working under stringent conditions, for example, at low temperaturse.51 Therefore, it is essential to produce high-quality NiHCF that could exhibit a long cycling life under severe conditions, meeting the requirements for large-scale energy storage.
In this work, a chelating agent-assisted route was used to synthesize Na-rich, ultrastable NiHCF with extremely long cycling stability, excellent rate performance, attractive temperature adaptability, and superior overcharge/overdischarge-resistance ability. At 25 °C, the obtained NiHCF can deliver a high specific capacity of 76.4 mA h g−1 at 0.2C (close to the theoretical value of ∼85 mA h g−1), an impressive high-rate capacity of 60 mA h g−1 at 50C (78.5% relative to that at 0.2C), and an extremely long cycle life of 90.4% retention after 16000 cycles at 20C. The NiHCF also exhibits promising electrochemical performance under stringent circumstances. The material exhibits good temperature adaptability, capable of working at −40 °C to 60 °C. The capacity retentions of NiHCF cycled at 60 °C and −20 °C are 95.5% after 600 cycles and 91.9% after 1800 cycles, respectively, at 5C. In addition, after overcharge to 4.8 V and overdischarge to 1.2 V, both high capacity and stable cycling are recovered after returning to a normal voltage range (2–4 V), with 95% retention after 500 cycles for overcharge and 100% retention after 500 cycles for overdischarge (1C). Excellent long-term cycling stability is achieved in an aqueous NiHCF/Zn battery (84.1% retention after 3100 cycles at 5C). Furthermore, kilogram-grade NiHCF was obtained by a scale-up preparation route, with which pouch-type batteries were assembled and the electrochemical performance was investigated. This work provides a promising and scalable route to produce high-quality NiHCF cathodes for SIBs aiming at large-scale energy storage.
Experimental section
Preparation of NiHCF
NiHCF was synthesized via a chelating agent-assisted coprecipitation route. In a typical synthesis, 5 mmol of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium (Na2EDTA, 99.5%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) and 5 mmol of NiSO4·6H2O (98.5%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized (DI) water to form the precursor solution A. 36 g of NaCl (99.5%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was dissolved in 100 mL of DI water to form solution B. After strong agitation, solution B and the supernatant of solution A were transferred into a flask and the mixed solution was then heated to 60 °C in an oil bath. Na4[Fe(CN)6] solution was prepared by dissolving 5 mmol of Na4[Fe(CN)6]·10H2O (99%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) into 100 mL of DI water. After that, the Na4[Fe(CN)6] solution was added into the above mixed solution drop by drop through a peristaltic pump. A green suspension was formed after the reaction, which was aged for 2 h at 60 °C with stirring. The green precipitate was then separated by centrifugation in DI water and absolute alcohol. Finally, the NiHCF was obtained after drying at 110 °C for 24 h in a vacuum.
Materials characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a Rigaku D/Max-2550pc powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained using a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). The morphologies of the samples were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi (Japan) S-4800 microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization with corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) mapping were carried out using a Thermal fisher (FEI) Tecnai F20 microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The water content in NiHCF was measured by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis using a Netzsch LFA467 system in N2. The molar ratios of Na, Ni and Fe were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) using an Agilent 720ES. The specific surface area was measured by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using Nova2000 equipment. Tap density was measured using a ZS-201 device.
Electrochemical measurements
NiHCF electrodes were prepared by a paste-coating method on Al foil current collectors. The NiHCF electrodes are composed of 70 wt% NiHCF, 20 wt% Ketjen Black, and 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. The loading of the active material (NiHCF) is 1.5–3.5 mg cm−2. The electrodes were dried at 110 °C in a vacuum overnight before cell fabrication. Organic coin-type half cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with metallic sodium as the anode, NiHCF as the cathode, and a glass-fiber membrane (Whatman GF/D) as the separator. A solution of 1.0 M NaPF6 dissolved in propylene carbonate (PC)/ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1 in volume) was used as the electrolyte, where 4 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was added as the additive. Aqueous coin-type half cells were assembled in air with metallic zinc as the anode, NiHCF as the cathode, and a glass-fiber membrane (Whatman GF/D) as the separator. A solution of 1.0 M NaCF3SO3 (NaTfO) and 0.1 M Zn(TfO)2 dissolved in DI water/acetonitrile (1:1 in weight) was used as the basic electrolyte (ACN50), and that with 5 vol% vinylene carbonate (VC) additive was used as the modified electrolyte (ACN50 + 5VC).
Galvanostatic cycling was conducted on a cell cycler (Neware Technology Ltd., China) between 2.0 and 4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) for organic half cells except for the overcharge/overdischarge tests. The specific capacity and current density were calculated based on the weight of NiHCF. A temperature adaptability test was carried out between −40 °C and 80 °C using a high/low temperature testing oven. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed at a scan rate from 0.2 to 1 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a VersaSTAT3 workstation with an AC voltage of 10 mV amplitude in 10−2–105 Hz. Galvanostatic cycling of aqueous coin-type cells was conducted on the cell cycler between 0.2 and 1.8 V (vs. Zn/Zn2+). The electrochemical measurements were all conducted at 25 °C except for the temperature adaptability tests.
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a, the NiHCF is highly crystallized evident from the sharp diffraction peaks. Besides, the well split peaks at 25° (220), 39° (420), and 50° (440) of NiHCF indicate monoclinic distortion from the face-centered cubic lattice.52 To further identify the crystal structure of our NiHCF sample, Rietveld refinements were conducted. The NiHCF can be indexed to a monoclinic structure without any impurity phases. The lattice parameters and atomic coordinates are shown in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI).† As depicted in the previous work,50,52,53 the good crystallization of NiHCF with a monoclinic phase is due to the strong chelating effect of Na2EDTA with Ni2+, which slows down coprecipitation reactions, leading to a high Na content and low defect.

As shown in Fig. 1b, the water content in NiHCF is determined to be 14.2 wt% by TG analysis. The molar ratios of Na/Ni and Fe/Ni are measured by ICP-AES. The detailed ICP analysis of NiHCF is given in Table S3 (ESI).† With the combined TG and ICP-AES analyses, the structural formula of NiHCF is determined to be Na2.2Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.8□0.2·2.5H2O, where □ represents the Fe(CN)6 vacancy, indicating a high Na content. To check the chemical states of Fe and Ni, XPS characterization on NiHCF was performed. The XPS survey spectrum in Fig. S1 (ESI)† detects the expected elements of Na, Ni, Fe, C, N and O. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, the bands at 708.6 and 721.5 eV can be assigned to Fe2+ 2p3/2 and Fe2+ 2p1/2, respectively. The bands of Fe3+ do not appear, implying that the dominant Fe ions are divalent. The bands at 856.5 and 874.0 eV are associated with Ni2+ 2p3/2 and Ni2+ 2p1/2, respectively, where a separation of the spin energy of 17.5 eV is observed, suggesting that the main valence state of Ni is Ni2+.54 Two weak bands at 863.1 and 880.8 eV are the satellite peaks of Ni2+.55
The SEM images of NiHCF (Fig. 2a and b) reveal that the NiHCF particles have a quasi-spherical shape with a particle size of 500 to 800 nm. It seems that the large secondary particles are constructed by the cross-growth of small primary particles. This growth mode can increase the particle size of NiHCF, which is favorable for its practical applications by increasing the stacking density of the electrode, improving the electrode processing, and reducing the amount of electrolyte used. Meanwhile, it also allows the formation of a multi-edge structure that is beneficial for rapid Na-ion diffusion between the particle/electrolyte interface. Usually, NiHCF crystallizes into small particles, typically 50–200 nm.39,56 Thus, this work provides a facile method to prepare large-size NiHCF particles. It is suggested that the formation of this unique structure is closely related to the use of Na2EDTA, where a strong complexing effect between Ni2+ and Na2EDTA significantly slows down the release of Ni2+, so as to decrease the nucleation rate of NiHCF and promote crystal growth of NiHCF.52 As seen in Fig. 2c–i, the HAADF-STEM and EDX mapping suggest a uniform elemental distribution of Na, Fe, Ni, C, N and O in NiHCF. As shown in Fig. 2j, the lattice spacing of 0.26 nm corresponds to the (22) planes of the monoclinic NiHCF, further suggesting the formation of NiHCF.

The rate performance of NiHCF at 25 °C is shown in Fig. 3a and b. NiHCF exhibits a specific capacity of 76.4 mA h g−1 with an average operating voltage of 3.3 V at 0.2C (1C = 85 mA g−1). Besides, the first coulombic efficiency reaches 99.9%, demonstrating a high reversibility of NiHCF. The ratio of capacitive contribution is calculated to be 28.9% at 0.2 mV s−1 in Fig. S2 (ESI)† using the previously reported method.57 The NiHCF cathode exhibits outstanding rate performance, delivering high capacities of 73.1, 71.9 and 69.1 mA h g−1 at 5C, 10C and 20C, respectively. Even at current rates up to 50C, the NiHCF can still yield a high capacity of 60.0 mA h g−1, corresponding to 78.5% of the value at 0.2C. The superior rate performance of NiHCF is ascribed to its open framework structure and the unique multi-edge structure that facilitates rapid Na-ion transport in bulk NiHCF and at the NiHCF/electrolyte interface. As the current rate returns to 0.2C, the capacity recovers to 75.1 mA h g−1 (98.3% of the initial value), indicating excellent structural reversibility of NiHCF. Note that the coulombic efficiencies at various rates can always approach 99.9%, suggesting remarkable electrochemical reversibility of NiHCF.

The long-term cycling performance of the NiHCF (25 °C) at various rates is shown in Fig. 3c–f and S3 (ESI).† At each current rate, the NiHCF exhibits excellent cycling stability. After cycling at 1C for 1800 cycles (around 6 months), the NiHCF retains a discharge capacity of 65.2 mA h g−1, corresponding to 86.2% of the initial value (Fig. 3c). When being charged at 2C and discharged at 5C, the NiHCF can maintain a high capacity retention of 95.2% after 7760 cycles (Fig. 3d). At a higher current rate (charge at 5C and discharge at 10C), the NiHCF also exhibits superior cycling stability with a capacity retention of 99.1% after 8000 cycles. In addition, the coulombic efficiency can always be close to 100% during cycling, indicating excellent reversibility of the NiHCF (Fig. 3e). Even at a current rate as high as 20C (complete charge or discharge within only 3 min), the NiHCF demonstrates an ultralong cycle life (90.4% retention after 16000 cycles) with a high reversibility (coulombic efficiency ∼ 100%) as shown in Fig. 3f. The extremely stable cycling of NiHCF is attributed to its rigid framework structure and unique “zero strain” characteristics, which ensures repeated intercalation/deintercalation of Na ions without structural damage.
The temperature adaptability of SIBs is critical for practical applications in large-scale energy storage. Therefore, temperature dependence of the electrochemical performance of NiHCF was investigated at 1C. The voltage profiles and discharge capacity of the NiHCF at temperatures ranging from 30 to 80 °C are shown in Fig. 4a, b and S4 (ESI).† With increasing the temperature, the NiHCF delivers an increasing capacity but with a decreasing coulombic efficiency as seen in Table S4 (ESI).† This suggests that the electrochemical activity of NiHCF increases to some extent, but some side reactions occur at elevated temperatures, especially over 60 °C. At 80 °C, the NiHCF delivers an extremely high charge capacity over 120 mA h g−1 and a rather low coulombic efficiency below 55% (Fig. S4a, ESI),† signifying accelerated side reactions at high temperatures. Of note is that after the temperature returns to 25 °C from 80 °C, the capacity is recovered to a normal value (Fig. S4b, ESI).† This suggests that the NiHCF itself has a relatively good structural stability and reversibility at elevated temperatures. However, a voltage gap between charge and discharge curves appears (Fig. S4b, ESI†), which is possibly due to slight structural degradation and the side reactions between NIHCF and the electrolyte when being cycled at high temperatures.

As seen in Fig. S5 (ESI),† the NiHCF shows the highest capacity and energy density (based on material) at 60 °C. Therefore, the rate performance and cycling stability of the NiHCF were further evaluated at 60 °C. Fig. 4c shows the voltage profiles of the NiHCF charged at 1C and discharged at various current rates at 60 °C. At 0.2C, the material can yield a high discharge capacity of ∼84.0 mA h g−1, close to the theoretical value of NiHCF (85.0 mA h g−1), which agrees with its high Na content. The discharge capacity is almost independent of the applied current density from 1C to 20C (Table S5, ESI†) with enhanced electrochemical kinetics at elevated temperatures. Even at 50C, the material can deliver a high discharge capacity of ∼74.0 mA h g−1, indicating outstanding rate performance of NiHCF. Fig. 4d illustrates the cycling stability of the NiHCF charged and discharged at 5C and 60 °C. A high capacity retention of 95.5% is achieved after 600 cycles, which suggests superior structural stability of the NiHCF at 60 °C. In addition, low polarization of the NiHCF is evident during cycling even at a high rate of 5C (Fig. S6, ESI†). At a moderate temperature of 45 °C, the material also shows a good cycling performance (Fig. S7, ESI†).
Besides high temperature, a good low-temperature performance is also important for practical applications of NiHCF. Fig. 5a and b demonstrate the voltage profiles and discharge capacity of the NiHCF at 1C from 20 to −40 °C. The NiHCF can retain capacities of 69.6, 66.4, and 63.1 mA h g−1 at 0, −10, and −20 °C, respectively, corresponding to 93.9%, 89.5%, and 85.0% of the capacities at 25 °C (Table S4, ESI†). The retention of a relatively high capacity suggests rapid electrode kinetics at low temperature because of the unique open framework of NiHCF. Even at a temperature as low as −40 °C, a capacity of 41.8 mA h g−1 can still be delivered, corresponding to 56.3% of the capacity at 25 °C. In addition, a high coulombic efficiency of 99.9% is obtained as seen in Fig. 5b. The results indicate that the NiHCF has an excellent structural stability and reversibility at low temperatures.

Fig. 5c shows the voltage profiles of the NiHCF at various discharge rates and 1C charge rate at −20 °C. At this temperature, high capacities of 66.9, 65.3 and 61.4 mA h g−1 are obtained at 1C, 2C, and 5C, respectively (Fig. 5d, Table S5, ESI†). At a rather high current rate of 20C, a capacity of 50 mA h g−1 can be obtained. The cycling performance of the NiHCF at −20 °C is presented in Fig. 5e, f and S8 (ESI).† After 500 cycles at 1C, the material can retain 97.4% of its initial capacity. After being cycled at a higher current density of 5C, an impressively high capacity retention of 91.9% is achieved after 1800 cycles, indicating excellent high-rate cycling stability at low temperatures. In order to understand the reason for the outstanding performance of the NiHCF, EIS measurements were carried out (Fig. S9 and Table S6, ESI†). Although Rct is rather high at low temperatures, the NiHCF can still deliver acceptable capacity and rate performance, which may be due to rapid Na-ion diffusion in the open structure of the Prussian material. As summarized in Fig. S9 (ESI),† the superb electrochemical performance of NiHCF at various temperatures suggests that the material is practical for all-climate applications. We compare the cycling performance and rate capability of some Prussian blue materials at various temperatures as shown in Tables S8 and S9 (ESI),† where the superb performance of our NiHCF material is highlighted.
In order to further investigate the superior structural stability of the NiHCF, overcharge (4.8 V compared to normal 4.0 V) and overdischarge (1.2 V compared to normal 2.0 V) tests were conducted. As shown in Fig. 6a, an extremely high capacity over 200 mA h g−1 is delivered at 0.2C after charge to 4.8 V, which can be attributed to structural reorganization and electrolyte decomposition during overcharge. In the subsequent discharge process at 0.2C, the material exhibits a normal discharge curve and delivers a discharge capacity that is somewhat higher than the normal value. Upon the following cycling at 1C in a normal voltage range (2–4 V), both the voltage profiles and capacity become normal, suggesting sufficient recovery of the original NiHCF structure. Stable cycling of the material is also realized with 95% capacity retained after 500 cycles at 1C (Fig. 6b) between 2 and 4 V. An overdischarge test was performed in a similar manner by discharging the cell to 1.2 V first at 0.2C, followed by charging the cell to 4 V at 0.2C. Although the cell also exhibits a rather high discharge capacity over 110 mA h g−1, the voltage profiles and capacity quickly recover to a normal state in the second cycle at 2–4 V (Fig. 6c). Stable cycling of the material (∼100% retention after 500 cycles at 1C) signifies the good recovery of the NiHCF structure after initial reorganization (Fig. 6d). Note that a deep overdischarge to 0.2 V leads to a high discharge capacity over 750 mA h g−1 accompanied by complete destruction of the crystal structure (Fig. S11c, ESI†) and morphology (Fig. S11d, ESI†). Ni XPS confirms the complete breaking of the Ni–N bonds,58 suggesting displacement or conversion reactions in NiHCF.59,60

The background in Fig. 6e and f is composed of an Al current collector and conducting carbon (Fig. S10, ESI†). 
To clarify the structural stability mechanism of the NiHCF cathode after overcharge and overdischarge, ex situ XRD studies were performed. As shown in Fig. 6e, compared with the XRD patterns of the pristine electrode, both the charged (4.0 V) and discharged (2.0 V) electrodes show no obvious changes in the XRD patterns. After charge to 4.8 V, the intensity of the peaks between 20° and 40° (2θ) is reduced and these peaks are broadened. Besides, the double peaks at around 25° (2θ) are combined into a single peak, indicating the formation of the cubic phase from the monoclinic phase.49 These changes in XRD suggest structural reorganization of the NiHCF after charge to 4.8 V. Note that after subsequent discharge to 2.0 V from 4.8 V, the structure of NiHCF is almost recovered evidenced from the reappearance of the double peaks, although the peak intensity is slightly reduced. After discharge to 1.2 V, only the double peaks at around 25° (2θ) are slightly broadened (Fig. 6f), suggesting minor structural changes of NiHCF. Negligible structural changes of NiHCF are also evident after charge to 4.0 V from 1.2 V. However, when the electrode was discharged to 0.2 V, a significant structural change of NiHCF occurs and the change is irreversible (Fig. S11c, ESI†), which can explain the rather low capacity after deep overdischarge. As a result, ex situ XRD studies agree well with the electrochemical performance of the NiHCF after overcharge and overdischarge.
To clearly elucidate the excellent cycling performance of NiHCF, the Rietveld refinements of NiHCF electrodes were carried out (Fig. S12, ESI†). The lattice parameters in Table S7 (ESI)† indicate a typical “zero strain” feature of NiHCF,46 evidenced by minor volume changes after 7760 cycles and after overcharge and overdischarge. Furthermore, the SEM images of the NiHCF electrodes were observed as seen in Fig. S13 (ESI).† After being cycled under various stringent conditions, the morphology of the NiHCF electrode can be generally preserved, agreeing well with the excellent cycling stability of the NiHCF electrode.
To demonstrate possible general use of the NiHCF material, its electrochemical performance in aqueous NiHCF/Zn batteries at 25 °C was also investigated. The aqueous cell is actually a Daniell-type hybrid-ion cell based on Na+ and Zn2+. During charge in this cell, Na+ ions are extracted from the NiHCF cathode and dissolved in the electrolyte while Zn2+ ions are reduced and deposited as metallic Zn on the Zn anode. In the discharge process, the Na+ cations are intercalated back into the NiHCF cathode, and the Zn2+ cations are stripped from the Zn anode and dissolved in the electrolyte.61 Due to the slower diffusivity and higher activation energy of Zn2+ than Na+ ions for insertion, the Zn2+ can hardly be inserted into NiHCF. Fig. 7a and b show the rate performance of the aqueous NiHCF/Zn cell between 0.2 and 1.8 V. The aqueous cell delivers capacities of 69.0, 67.0, 66.0, 65.0, 62.0, 59.0, 55.0, and 41.0 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50C, respectively, indicating that the NiHCF can also realize high-rate cycling in the aqueous electrolyte. When the current density returns to 0.2C from 50C, the material can recover a high capacity of 68.3 mA h g−1, indicating an excellent reversibility of the NiHCF in the aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, the NiHCF/Zn cell can achieve a long cycle life of 3100 cycles at 5C (77.3% retention) in a water/ACN hybrid electrolyte (ACN50) as shown in Fig. 7c. When 5 vol% VC was added to the aqueous electrolyte (ACN50 + 5VC), the cycling performance is further improved to 84.1% after the same cycles (Fig. 7d). The results prove the chemical/electrochemical stability of NiHCF in the aqueous electrolyte at a normal concentration.

For practical applications in large-scale energy storage, a scale-up preparation of NiHCF is important. In this work, we can achieve a 4 kilogram-grade yield of NiHCF for one preparation with the tap density of 0.80 g cm−3 and BET specific surface area of 2.4 m2 g−1 using a 100 L reactor (Fig. 8a, b and Video 1, ESI†). The NiHCF electrodes were made by coating the slurry with the scale-up prepared NiHCF followed by calendaring and cutting (Fig. 8c and d). To fabricate full batteries with the NiHCF cathode, the use of commercial hard carbon (HC, Kuraray, Co., Ltd.) was first evaluated (Fig. S14, ESI†). Fig. 8e shows the fabricated pouch-type NiHCF/HC full batteries. Fig. 8f, g and Video 2 (ESI)† show one battery that lights up LEDs and powers a toy car. Fig. 8h illustrates the working principle of the Na-ion full battery. Fig. 8i shows the voltage profiles of the pouch-type NiHCF/HC full battery at 200 mA (∼0.5C) between 1.5 and 3.7 V (after the formation process). The battery delivers a discharge capacity of ∼400 mA h with stable cycling during 20 cycles, implying practical applications of the NiHCF in Na-ion batteries.

Conclusions
In summary, a Na-rich, large-size (500–800 nm) NiHCF material was obtained by a Na2EDTA-assisted coprecipitation method with a controlled reaction rate. The preparation method can be scaled up to produce a kilogram-grade sample per batch using a 100 L reactor. The product exhibits a unique multi-edge structure enabling both rapid Na-ion transport at the particle/electrolyte interface and a stable structure for a long term, and high-rate cycling, even under stringent conditions. At room temperature, the NiHCF exhibits an ultralong cycle life with 90.4% capacity retained after 16000 cycles at 20C and a superb rate capability delivering 78.5% capacity at 50C relative to 0.2C. The material demonstrates excellent temperature adaptability, capable of working in a wide temperature range (−40–60 °C) and sustaining stable cycling at both high (60 °C) and low (−20 °C) temperatures. At −20 °C, the NiHCF can maintain 91.9% of its initial capacity after 1800 cycles at 5C. The material can withstand abuse tests enabling structural and performance recovery after overcharge and overdischarge. In an aqueous NiHCF/Zn cell, the NiHCF can also achieve a good cycling stability with 84.1% capacity retained after 3100 cycles at 5C using a water/acetonitrile hybrid electrolyte. The superior electrochemical performance of NiHCF is attributed to its open framework, unique multi-edge structure, large size and “zero strain” characteristics, which render it promising applications in large-scale energy storage.
