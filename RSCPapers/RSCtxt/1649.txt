    , Accepted 7th May 2020First published on 12th May 2020AbstractPolycrystalline sulfides are promising thermoelectric materials because of their abundance, non-toxicity, and low cost. However, their low thermoelectric performance hampers their possible large-scale industrial application. In this work, Cu self-doping in Cu2+xZn1−xSnS4, prepared using a simple processing route, realizes the decoupling of thermal and electric transport as follows. The additional copper ions occupy Zn sites and provide more carriers, which leads to excellent hole conductivity. Moreover, when x is above 0.125, the content of Cn/Zn disordered sites is beyond the percolation threshold (∼0.3) of thermal diffusivity. A maximum power factor (450 μW m−1 K−2) is obtained for Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4. Combined with ultra-low specific heat below the theory predicted minimum for structural disordering on the copper and zinc sites, the κ of the material reduces to 0.22 W m−1 K−1 at 773 K, which is minimum in thermoelectric materials up to now. Moreover, hot forging (deformation strain ∼64% and maximum of displacement rate ∼18 mm min−1), a dynamic plastic deformation process, was employed to produce defects on different length scales (point defects, dislocations, stacking faults and deformation twins), that optimize the power factor and lattice thermal conductivity. Based on the above synergistic effects, a high ZT value of 1.1 has been achieved in Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 ceramics, and there is 18-fold increase in ZT value compared with that of conventionally processed intrinsic Cu2ZnSnS4.
Introduction
The energy crisis and global climate protection are drawing enormous attention to the need for more efficient utilization of energy. About 54% of the world's total energy need is consumed in the industrial sector, in which waste heat, a byproduct of industrial processes (such as steel mills, paper plants, refineries, chemical plants, oil and gas pipelines, and general manufacturing) accounts for about 60% of this consumption. High temperature (>400 °C) waste heat is efficiently recovered using steam turbines, however, the utilization of low-quality waste heat (<400 °C) is still a huge challenge, and corresponds to 70% of the total waste energy generated. Progresses in energy harvesting in this area will make a big contribution to energy recovery from waste heat, leading to a reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Screw expander and low pressure saturated steam generation are possible choices; however, their disadvantages are low efficiency and short operating life. Thermoelectric materials, which convert thermal and electrical energy using the Seebeck/Peltier effects, provide us an alternative method to recycle low quality waste heat. They have already received great attention for solid state cooling and energy generation applications due to their additional advantages of being compact, lightweight, quiet, and reliable.1
However, there are two main challenges before realizing the commercial application of thermoelectric materials on a large scale for waste heat recovery. One challenge is to achieve a higher conversion efficiency of heat to electricity, competitive with traditional turbine power generators (30%). In order to achieve this, it is necessary to have materials with a high thermoelectric figure of merit ZT value ((S2σ/κ)T, where S, σ and κ is Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity respectively). Several effective methods, such as low-dimensional crystal structures and band engineering, have been developed to obtain higher ZT values.2 While materials with ZT values of as high as 2.0 have been reported, it seems possible to further improve the ZT value with further optimization.3 The other challenge is that most of the thermoelectric compounds with high ZT values contain toxic, scarce and expensive elements (such as Pb, Te, Se and Sb), which is inhibiting their large scale commercial application for industrial waste heat recovery. It is more urgent to develop inexpensive and efficient alternative materials using earth abundant and non-toxic elements.1
Sulphur is one of the most common earth abundant, nontoxic elements, and its extraction involves an economical preparation process. In the last two decades, some chalcogenide based semiconductors (such as CuxS or Cu2ZnSnS4) have attracted considerable interest because of their beneficial use in thin film solar cells with high power conversion efficiency of over 12%, being promising alternatives to the currently used toxic commercialized solar cell absorbers.4–6 Their performance can be improved by partial cation substitution to mitigate the negative effects of different types of defects.7 Recently, these sulfide compounds were reported to have good thermoelectric properties, which make them a hot topic in thermoelectrics research.8–10 Atomic-scale percolation was observed in digenite CuxS related compounds with single phase, in which copper ions/lattice interstices were hypothetically considered as a minor, electrically conductive phase, and an obvious enhancement of ZT values was obtained near the percolation threshold.11,12 However, it is impossible to further increase the ZT value of CuxS because the change of Cu/S ratio leads to a phase transition and the disappearance of the related digenite phases.11
The Cu2–Zn(Fe)–Sn–S4 solid solution is related to the mineral kesterite (belongs to diamond-like semiconductors), and has a complex crystal structure. For single crystal, the crystal structure has two electrical functional units: Cu2S4 units are helpful for electrical conductivity and ZnSnS4 units act as insulating units, as shown in Fig. 1a. Due to its insulating layer units, intrinsic Cu2ZnSnS4 has a major drawback as a thermoelectric material in that its electrical conductivity is low and therefore its associated ZT value is below 0.1. Since this compound can be considered as an ideal atomic-scale layered structure composite with electrically insulating and conducting components, it is possible to improve the TE properties using the effect of atomic percolation as follows. Some Zn sites in the insulating layers can be replaced by Cu ions (Fig. 1b), and at high temperature the Cu and Zn ions in the unit are distributed randomly. Meanwhile, the CuZn anti-site has a lower formation energy and relatively deeper acceptor level compared to the Cu vacancy,13 which leads to Cu2ZnSnS4 being an intrinsic p-type semi-conductor. If Cu2ZnSnS4 is self doped with Cu on the Zn site, more CuZn point defects will introduce significantly more hole carriers and reduce the electrical resistivity. As a result, an obvious enhancement of thermoelectric properties would be observed near the percolation threshold because of electric conductivity's increase.
 Fig. 1  The crystal structure of Cu2ZnSnS4 (left) and atomic schematic of Cu doped Cu2ZnSnS4(right). 
Currently, Cu2ZnSnS4 is synthesized by melt processing14 or chemical methods (such as hot injection15 and solution method16). It takes a long time (3–7 days) for traditional melting processes to produce single phase Cu2ZnSnS4 ingots in order to avoid the explosion of silica tubes because of the evaporation of sulphur. An additional issue is that ZnS appears as a secondary phase during the cooling process. Chemical synthesis consumes a large amount of energy, has a low yield with high cost, and consequently is not suitable for large scale industrial production. Compared with these methods, mechanical alloying by ball milling is a simple and economic way to produce pure Cu2ZnSnS4 powders. In this paper we use mechanical alloying combined with spark plasma sintering to fabricate single phase, dense Cu2ZnSnS4 ceramics.
Additionally, dynamic plastic deformation can produce ultrafine-grained structures with preferred crystallographic orientation and is an effective industrial process for modifying the mechanical properties of structural metal.17–19 Up to now, this process has only been used to fabricate highly anisotropic, bulk, polycrystalline thermoelectric materials with excellent in-plane electronic/thermal transport properties, and there are few quantitative reports on the effect of the high-densities of defects introduced during plastic deformation on thermoelectric properties. Herein, we first adopt hot forging, a dynamic plastic deformation technology, to a cubic crystal system to introduce defects with different dimensions (point defects, dislocations, stacking faults and deformation twins) to optimize the power factor and thermal conductivity. Based on the above synergistic effects, Cu self-doped Cu2+xZn1−xSnS4 samples were successfully fabricated, which after optimization have a ZT value of 1.1, which makes its large-scale industrial application potentially possible.
Experimental section
Commercial copper, zinc, tin and sulfur powders (high purity, above 99.9%, all from Aldrich, UK) were selected. The powders were weighed in stoichiometric ratio and placed into stainless steel milling jars with steel balls (the weight ratio of the steel balls to powders was 20:1) in a glove box to avoid reaction with moisture and oxygen in the air (Beta, Saffron, UK). The mixtures were ball-milled at 350 rpm for 40 hours in an atmosphere of high-purity argon in a planetary ball milling machine (QM-3SP2, Nanjing University, China). The crystal structure of the powders was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD).
The powders were put into a graphite die (an inner diameter ∼15 mm) and then sintered at 600 °C under 60 MPa at a heating rate (50 K min−1) for a holding time of 8 min in a spark plasma sintering furnace (HPD25/1 FCT; Rauenstein, Germany) in a vacuum environment.
The hot forged samples were prepared as follows. Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 was sintered at 600 °C under 60 MPa for 8 min in a graphite die with a diameter of 12 mm, then the sample was taken out and placed in an oversize die with a diameter of 20 mm, and reheated to 600 °C and hot forged at 50 MPa for 3 min. Schematic diagram of hot forging process is also shown in Fig. S1.†
The bulk samples were cut into 2.5 × 2.5 × 13 mm bars for electrical conductivity (σ) and Seebeck coefficient (S) measurements using differential temperature and four point probe methods in a vacuum environment. The thermal diffusivity coefficient was measured using the laser flash method (NETZSCH, LFA457, Germany). The Archimedes method was used to measure the density of the samples. The specific heat was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (NETZSCH DSC 404C Germany). The thermal conductivity (κ) was calculated from the product of thermal diffusivity, specific heat and density. Usually the uncertainties of instruments are ±3% for electric conductivity, ±4% for Seebeck coefficient, ±1% for the density, ±3% for thermal diffusivity. Finally, ZT value was calculated as follows ZT = S2σT/κ, where T is the absolute temperature. The microstructure of samples was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).
Results and discussion
Elemental powders (all from Sigma-Aldrich Co) were placed into steel pots in an argon atmosphere to ball mill. We studied the effect of ball milling time on the final properties and found that a milling time of 40 hours and milling rate of 350 rpm was optimum to obtain the best TE properties. For Rietveld analysis, the crystallographic structure of the powders were analyzed using X-ray powder diffraction on a PANalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer (PANalytical, Cambridge, UK), fitted with an X'Celerator detector, using Ni filtered CuKα radiation over the range of 5° to 70° in steps of 0.0167° with an effective count rate of 200 s per step. A preliminary structural analysis was carried out using the Rietveld method using the GSAS suite of programs. All of the peaks can be indexed as space group I2m, as shown in Fig. 2, and related atom positions are shown in Table 1, which can be indexed as the kesterite-type structure (JCPDS No. 26-0575).

After doping, the substitution of Zn by Cu does not obviously affect the peak positions or the parameters of the crystal structure (as shown in Table 2) because of the similar diameters of the Cu and Zn ions. Below x = 0.15, no second phase or impurities were found in ball milled powders (as shown in Fig. S2 and S3 in ESI†).

To the nominal composition of Cu2+xZn1−xSnS4, more CuZn point defects were introduced into the compound. The additional copper ions occupy Zn sites and destroy the electrically insulating properties of the ZnSnS4 layer units (as indicated in Fig. 1). Additionally, every CuZn point defect provides one acceptor level, and generates one hole, increasing the charge carrier content. As a result, the electrical resistivity should decrease with increasing Cu content x. Fig. 3 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, power factor, thermal conductivity and ZT values of Cu2+xZn1−xSnS4 samples spark plasma sintered at 600 °C for 8 min. As shown in Fig. 3a, the room temperature resistivity decreases from 2 × 106 μΩ m to 43 μΩ m when x changes from 0 to 0.15 (bulk samples were fabricated at 600 °C for 8 min under 60 MPa using spark plasma sintering process). For intrinsic Cu2ZnSnS4, CuZn antisites have the lowest formation energy of any of the possible defects, with an acceptor level of 0.12 eV, while VCu defects have the second lowest formation energy with an acceptor level of 0.02 eV,20 leading to its intrinsic p-type electrical conductivity (Fig. 3b). The increase in carrier concentration reduces the Seebeck coefficient with increasing Cu content x. According to the equation for the power factor PF = σS2, a maximum power factor (450 μW m−1 K−2) was obtained for Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4.

Fig. 4a shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat (Cp) of Cu2ZnSnS4 (average value from six measurements). For a normal solid, Cp should increase monotonically with temperature and reach a maximum value near 3N0κ(Cv, where N0 is Avogadro constant κ is Boltzamn constant) at the Debye temperature according to the Debye model; such as for the Cp values (theory prediction) of the cation-ordered phase Cu2ZnSnS4 in Fig. 4 (blue curve21). For Cu2ZnSnS4 compounds with kesterite phase, Cp first increases with increasing temperature and reaches a maximum of 0.45 J g−1 K−1, near the upper limit value of 3N0κ, between 400 K and 500 K. After this peak, there is a significant reduction in Cp from 0.44 J g−1 K−1 to 0.23 J g−1 K−1. The broad peak between 300 K and 600 K should correspond to the relaxation of a second-order phase transition (whose critical temperature, Tc, is near 550 K (ref. 22)) between ordered and completely disordered Cu2ZnSnS4, which also occurs in silver-based compounds such as AgCuS and AgCrSe2.23,24 At higher temperatures, higher thermal activation energy makes the swapping of Cu and Zn positions easier. Since the effective ionic radii of Cu+ and Zn2+ (77 and 74 pm) are much smaller than that of S2− (184 pm),25 the copper and zinc ions are randomly distributed among the 2c and 2d sites26 in the scaffold crystal structure consisting of tin and sulfur ions. A similar behaviour of Cp is also observed in Cu2−xSe compounds because of its Cu+ partial liquid-like behaviour. However, the calculated Debye temperature of Cu2ZnSnS4 is about 250–300 K,21 and the Cp values at higher temperature (much above the Debye temperature) are some below ∼2N0κ(Cv), near the minimum limit of liquid behaviour.27 If we simply consider an amorphous solid with a concentration N of two-level systems at low energies with a level splitting Δ much less than the phonon Debye cutoff kBθ. The partition function of one system is, Z = 2cosh(Δ/2τ), with τ = kBT. Suppose that Δ is distributed with uniform probability in the range Δ = 0 to Δ = Δ0. The average value of Cv is (1)
 Fig. 4  (a) Temperature dependence of specific heat (Cp) of Cu2ZnSnS4 (the blue line is first principle calculation curve from ref. 21) and (b) crystal structure of disordered Cu2ZnSnS4 at high temperature. 
The integral cannot be evaluated in closed form. For τ≫Δ0, the value of the integral is roughly (Δ0/kBT)3/3 and in this limit which approaches zero as the temperature T increases.28 As shown in Fig. 4b, above the order-disorder phase transition, the copper cations in the Cu2S4 and ZnSnS4 units lose their lattice points and become disordered. This leads to a Cu–Zn–S liquid-like matrix with a Sn–S crystal network inside, and should lead to lower specific heat according to eqn (1), which is directly related to an ultra-low thermal conductivity (κ).
As shown in Fig. 3d, above the order-disorder phase transition temperature near 550 °C, the values of all of the samples (0.3–0.4) are much lower than for other compounds (such as Bi2Te3,29 SnTe30,31 or MgAgSb32,33), and similar to the theoretical value of the minimum super-lattice thermal conductivity with 4 period length.34 The equation L = 1.5 + exp(−|S|/116) (where L is in 10−8 W Ω K−2 and S in μV K−1)35 is used in order to accurately estimate the charge carrier contribution to the thermal conductivity according to the Wiedemann–Franz law (κe = LσT). The lattice thermal conductivity (κl) is obtained by substracting the electrical contribution to the thermal conductivity (κe) from the total thermal conductivity (κ), which is shown in Fig. 3e. The Cu2+xZn1−xSnS4 with x ≤ 0.1 have similar κl values between 0.2 and 0.25. This ultra low κl is attributed to high structural disordering of the copper and zinc anti-sites in the crystalline units, which localizes the phonons and shortens the phonon mean free path. In Cu2ZnSnS4, its approximately tetrahedral structure looks like a 1 × 1 × 2 supercell expansion of the zinc-blende structure, in which every S is surrounded by two Cu, one Zn, and one Sn. Above Tc, there is complete randomisation of the Cu and Zn among the 2c and 2d sites, with about 70% of the Cu and Zn atoms on the “correct” crystallographic sites.26 The interchange of atoms between lattice sites with small energetic differences localizes the phonon transportation. As a result, when more anti-sites (x of 0.125 and 0.15) are introduced and the content of Cn/Zn anti-sites is beyond the percolation value (∼0.3)11,36,37 of thermal conductivity, κl reduces to 0.13–0.17 W m−1 K−1, half the value for Cu2ZnSnS4.

Fig. 5 show the microstructure of Cu2+xZn1−xSnS4 samples sintered using SPS at 600 °C for 8 min. All of the samples have similar microstructure with equiaxed grains. The average grain size of Cu2ZnSnS4 is about 0.3 μm. The  defects (with x ≤ 0.1) pin grain boundary migration, and the grains of Cu2+xZn1−xSnS reduce to 0.2 μm (in Fig. 5b and c). We confirmed that Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 is still single phase with I2m space group (as shown in Fig. S3†). Since all of the samples have similar microstructures with similar grain sizes, there was no difference in the effect of the grain boundaries to κl between the samples with different Cu content.
 Fig. 5  SEM images of Cu2+xZn1−xSnS4 samples sintered using SPS at 600 °C for 8 min: (a) x = 0; (b) x = 0.01; and (c) x = 0.15. 
As a result, the maximum ZT value reached 0.63 near 400 °C in the x = 0.125 material due to an enhanced power factor and ultra low thermal conductivity. This value is very competitive for a p-type material for mid-temperature application because the materials contains abundant and inexpensive elements. However, the ZT value of Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 is lower than the optimized values of some antimony-containing tetrahedrites, such as ZnO nanoparticles dispersed Cu12Sb3.96Ge0.04S13 (∼0.96)38 and Nb2O5 nanoparticles-dispersed Cu11.5Ni0.5Sb4S13−δ (∼1.2).39 Is it possible for the properties of Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 to be further improved for the commercial thermoelectric application?
Dynamic plastic deformation technology can refine crystal grains, and is an effective industrial process for modifying the mechanical properties of structural metals. The bulk modulus of kesterite-type Cu2ZnSnS4 single crystal is about 67.8 GPa calculated using density-functional theory (DFT), and its shear modulus is about 29.7 GPa.40 According to Pugh's criterion,41 the fact that its B/G ratio (∼2.28) is much larger than 1.75 indicates that kesterite-type Cu2ZnSnS4 should be quite ductile, especially at high temperatures. So dynamic plastic deformation may not destroy the wholeness of the samples and be suitable to tailor physical properties. Based on this assumption, in the following work we introduced superplastic (dynamic plastic) deformation by hot forging to tailor the transport properties in order to further improve the ZT value of Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 to above 1. The hot forged samples were prepared as follows: Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 was sintered at 600 °C under 60 MPa in a graphite die with a diameter of 12 mm, then the sample was taken out and placed in an oversize die with a diameter of 20 mm, and reheated to 600 °C and hot forged at 50 MPa for 3 min. We tracked the deformation behavior of Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4, and the details can be found in the ESI.† It was found that by performing experiment between 500 °C and 600 °C that the optimum deformation window is near 600 °C (the sample is broken when hot forged at 550 °C), and the deformation parameters are shown in Fig. 5. Under the initial deformation pressure of 50 MPa, the deformation strain (Δl/l0) reached 0.64 with the sample's diameter changing from 12 cm to 20 cm. The maximum of displacement rate was 18 mm min−1, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  The deformation parameters of Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 hot forged at 600 °C for 3 min under 50 MPa (the forging was done on a sample sintered at 600 °C under 60 MPa in the first step). 

Fig. 7 show typical SEM images at different magnifications of hot forged Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 sample (the fracture surface). The grains are still equiaxed after forging and there is no obvious anisotropic structure, which is confirmed by the XRD patterns and intensities (as shown in Fig. S4†). The main microstructural difference between before and after the forging is that the grains grow from 0.2 to 1 μm because the holding time of the forging process is prolonged for another 3 min at 600 °C, which indicates that there was dynamic recrystallization. The uneven microstructure comes from the large strain rate, which was also observed in the dynamic deformation of nickel-based super-alloy.42 The fracture surfaces display cleavage facets produced by trans-crystalline rupture, which indicates the residual stress is preserved after sintering and its origin should be the dislocations or other defects produced by the hot forging process.

Fig. 8 shows typical TEM images of the forged materials, which contain a high concentration of defects. The apparent dimension of the defects is of the order of 10 nm, which is comparable to the stress fields associated with them. In addition to limiting the dynamic recovery rate, the low stacking fault and twin energies of the face-centred-cubic crystal structure and the rapid heating and cooling during SPS resulted in the formation of defects which are shown in stacking faults and deformation twins. Both types of defects lead to an increased strain hardening rate, which made the sample brittle, leading to it breaking when hot forged at 550 °C (as shown in Fig. S6†). After hot forging, these defects with different dimensions can further scatter phonons in Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 and produce a large contribution to lowering κl.
 Fig. 8  TEM images of Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 after hot forging. 
The thermoelectric properties of Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 with and without hot forging are shown in Fig. 9. Since the sample is hot forged at 873 K (600 °C), the thermoelectric properties were measured below 723 K in order to obtain reliable and repeatable results. The resistivity of the sample without hot forging has a minimum value near 500 K, corresponding to the order-disorder phase transition. After hot forging, this minimum becomes broad, which suggests that hot forging produces further disordering of Cu–Zn atom positions. Meanwhile, the resistivity decreases to 40 μΩ m, much lower than that of the sample without hot forging. Since plastic deformation normally introduces higher defect density and lowers the carrier mobility,43 the reduction of resistivity must stem from a higher carrier concentration. For example, copper or zinc atoms can go into the interstitial positions, and the defects such as  and  will introduce more hole carriers because they have remarkably low formation energies and electronically passivate deep levels in the band gap.13 This also leads to a decrease of Seebeck coefficient, as shown in Fig. 9a. As a result, the power factors above the order-disorder temperature of the hot forged sample are much larger than that of the sample without hot forging. There is a maximum enhancement of ∼15% from 460 μW m−1 K−2 (without hot forging) to 530 μW m−1 K−2 (with hot forging) at 723 K (Fig. 9b). As shown in Fig. 9c, at higher temperatures both samples have similar thermal conductivity values, and near room temperature the sample after hot forging has a much high thermal conductivity, because hot forging introduces more carriers and leads to an obvious increase of hole thermal conductivity. As a result, although the defects (point defects, dislocations, stacking faults and crystal twins) introduced by hot forging can heavily decrease the lattice thermal conductivity (∼0.06 W m−1 K−1), the total thermal conductivity before and after hot forging have similar values. To our knowledge, it is impossible for lattice thermal conductivity to be so low. There are two purposes why we still calculate these values in this paper: (1) there is still no proper model of Lorentz constant to estimate the electronic thermal conductivity in Wiedemann–Franz law, and the values of lattice thermal conductivity of Cu2ZnSnS4 compounds is not convincing; (2) in the paper, the effects of two methods (doping and hot foring) on the lattice thermal conductivity could be qualitatively discussed. Due to higher power factor, a maximum ZT value ∼1.1 (80% enhancement) was obtained at 723 K after hot forging.

The ZT values of several promising candidates for thermoelectric energy harvesting are listed in Fig. 10. In order to estimate the possibility of large-scale application in waste recovery, a new parameter, ZTcost, is defined with ZTmax divided by raw material costs ($ per ton, as shown in Table S1†). Most of them contain toxic, rare (<1 ppm in the crust) or expensive elements, and their ZTcost values are below 0.6 × 10−4/$ because of their high raw material costs. Copper-containing sulfides are more competitive and Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 has the highest ZTcost value of ∼1.6 × 10−4/$. Meanwhile, the ZT value (∼1.1) of Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 is very encouraging, and there is only a small difference between the ZT values of this compound and other advanced thermoelectric materials (1.3–2). Fig. 10b shows the ZT values of some popular p-type green sulfides containing earth abundant elements that can be used for mid-temperature waste heat energy recovery (473–723 K). Mid-temperature ZT values of Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4 are much higher than those of other sulfides such as SnS, TiS2, and FeS. Unlike CuxS compounds, the sulfurization temperature of Cu2ZnSnS4 is about 823 K, and it is chemically stable in air below 720 K.44 So it is an ideal candidate for an environmentally friendly p-type leg in thermoelectric devices to operate in air for waste heat recovery.

Conclusions
Polycrystalline sulfide compounds Cu2+xZn1−xSnS4 (x = 0–0.15) have been fabricated using mechanical alloying combined with dynamic plastic deformation. The additional copper ions occupy zinc sites, destroy the insulating properties of the ZnSnS4 units, and act as acceptors to produce more holes, which is very effective to modulate the carrier concentration and therefore enhance the electrical properties. Above the order-disorder phase transition temperature, a Cu–Zn liquid-like matrix with a Sn–S crystal network inside leads to intrinsic ultra-low specific heat values. More CuZn point defects (x of 0.125 and 0.15) are introduced and the content of Cu/Zn disorder is more than the percolation value (∼0.3), corresponding to enhanced phonon scattering and decreased lattice thermal conductivity. Meanwhile, CuZn point defects in the distorted structure lead to an improvement of the power factor and the decrease of lattice thermal conductivity, leading to a higher ZT value. To further improve ZT, hot forging was adopted as a dynamic plastic deformation technology to introduce more defects with different dimensions (point defects, dislocations, stacking faults and deformation twins) to optimize the carrier concentration, power factor and thermal conductivity. Based on the above synergistic effects, a high ZT value of 1.1 has been achieved for Cu2.125Zn0.875SnS4, which is an 18-fold enhancement compared with that of the intrinsic Cu2ZnSnS4 (ZT ∼ 0.06), which makes it realistic for use in large-scale industrial waste heat recovery. The dynamic plastic deformation approach can also be extended to other emerging thermoelectric materials.
