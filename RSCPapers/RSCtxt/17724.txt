    , Accepted 13th June 2016First published on 14th June 2016AbstractMesoporous carbon (MC)-imbedded tungsten carbide (W2C) composites are synthesized via a simple methodology and subsequently used as flexible counter electrodes (CEs) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The W2C/MC composite possesses remarkable electrochemical properties for both novel organic disulfide/thiolate and conventional triiodide/iodide redox couples, with a performance that surpasses those of W2C and MC separate components. Thus, the iodide electrolyte based-DSCs involving W2C/MC as a flexible CE shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 7.61%. Remarkably, the W2C/MC composite is also found to be suitable as a CE for organic sulfide redox couple electrolyte based-DSCs, showing a much higher PCE (5.96%) as compared to their separate W2C and MC component counterparts (5.08 and 4.38%, respectively).
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have received considerable attention in virtue of their simple assembly procedure, environmental friendliness, good plasticity, and building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) characteristics.1,2 The counter electrode (CE), along with the redox couple, is one of the key components of DSCs serving as a catalyst for the regeneration of the redox couple.3,4 Pt deposited on F-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass is commonly applied as a CE material since Pt has been proven to combine remarkable electron collector properties with high efficiency as a catalyst for the traditional triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) redox process.5,6 When pursuing high power conversion efficiency (PCE), Pt-based CEs seem to be appropriate materials. Practical and economic considerations, however, suggest replacement of expensive Pt with new CEs combining high catalytic activity and low cost. In this sense, several low-cost catalysts such as carbon materials,7,8 conductive polymers,9,10 and inorganic materials (e.g., carbides, nitrides, oxides, sulfides, phosphides, silicides, selenides, tellurides) have been proposed to replace Pt.11–20
As pointed out above, the CE acts as a catalyst during the regeneration of the redox couple, with I3−/I− being widely used as a redox couple. However, the iodide electrolyte has several disadvantages such as visible light absorption competing with the sensitizer, I2 sublimation, and corrosive effects on several metals (e.g., Ag, Au).21 With the aim to overcome these defects, organic redox couples such as disulfide/thiolate (T2/T−) and metal complex redox pairs involving Co3+/2+ have been investigated. In this sense, Sun's group found an organic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) CE to improve performance as compared to Pt during the T2/T− redox process, with the corresponding DSCs showing a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.60%.22 Similarly, Ma's group reported a TiC CE to present high catalytic activity in the Co3+/2+ redox reaction, resulting in DSCs with a much higher PCE than the Pt-based device (4.13 vs. 2.91%).23 Consequently, new redox couples such as T2/T− and Co3+/2+ require Pt-free CE catalysts to achieve high PCE and low cost.
Transition metal carbides showing high catalytic activity, electrical conductivity, and stability under harsh conditions are promising materials. In our previous work, commercial tungsten carbide (WC) was used as a CE regeneration catalyst in DSCs involving the traditional I3−/I− redox couple. This WC-based DSCs showed a lower PCE as compared to its Pt-based counterpart (5.35 vs. 7.89%), and the relative low catalytic activity was attributed to the large particle size and low surface area of the WC material.24 The catalytic activity of carbides can thus be improved upon development of synthesis methodologies resulting in small particle size and large surface area materials. Lee et al. prepared nano-sized WC-based DSCs with a PCE still lower than the Pt system (7.01 vs. 8.23%).25 Alternatively, the dispersion of carbide particles onto a high surface-area carrier to form a composite catalyst was also effective. In this work, we synthesized a composite material (W2C/MC) comprised of W2C nanoparticles imbedded into mesoporous carbon (MC). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel polarization curves were applied to investigate the catalytic behavior of the as-prepared W2C/MC and its separate components (i.e., W2C and MC). The as-prepared W2C/MC composite was then used, for the first time, as a flexible CE catalyst for both the conventional I3−/I− and the organic T2/T− redox couples in DSCs.
Experimental
1. Synthesis of mesoporous carbon (MC)
W2C and MC were prepared according to a previous report.26 In detail, polyethylene polypropylene glycol (F127, 2.5 g) was added to a solution containing water (10 mL) and ethanol (10 mL) and then stirred for 30 min. Resorcinol (1.6 g) and HCl (0.2 g, 37 wt%) were then added to the solution and stirred for 1 h. Subsequently, formaldehyde (2.4 g, 37 wt%) was added to the solution. The solution was left to stand in the dark for 2 weeks until it separated into two layers. The upper layer was discarded, and the lower layer was cured at 90 °C for 5 days until a gel was obtained. The gel was thermally decomposed at 700 °C in nitrogen for 3 h and the MC was collected.
2. Synthesis of W2C
Tungsten chloride (3.97 g, WCl6) was added to 10 mL of ethanol while stirring for 30 min. The solution immediately turned brown, producing W-orthoester. Next, 5 equivalent of urea was added to the obtained W-orthoester solution and stirred until the urea was completely dissolved to obtain a urea–metal precursor. Subsequently, the viscous urea–metal precursor solution was dried at 130 °C to get rid of the residual solvent. Then, the precursor was sintered at 800 °C for 4 h under a N2 atmosphere; the objective product of W2C was obtained.
3. Synthesis of W2C/MC
We tried to prepare W2C/MC using a modified method according to our previous work.24 In detail, 2.5 g of polyethylene–polypropylene glycol (F127) was added to a solution containing 10 mL of water and 10 mL of ethanol under stirring. 1.6 g of resorcinol and 0.2 g of HCl (37 wt%) were then added to the solution and stirred until the solution turned light yellow. Next, 0.5 g of ammonium paratungstate was added to the solution and then stirred for 2 h. Next, add 2.4 g of formaldehyde (37 wt%) to the solution, which immediately turned ivory. The solution was allowed to stand in the dark for 2 weeks until it separated into two layers. The upper layer was discarded and the lower layer was cured for 5 days at 90 °C until a brown gel was obtained. The brown gel was then thermally decomposed at 400, 600, 800, 1000 and 1100 °C in nitrogen for 3 h, respectively. Finally the W2C imbedded into mesoporous carbon (W2C/MC) was achieved at 1100 °C.
4. Cell fabrication
W2C/MC, W2C, and MC CEs were prepared using the same spray-coating method. Take W2C/MC for instance, 100 mg of W2C/MC was dispersed in 5 mL of isopropanol. The solution was then milled for 4 h and ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min to prepare the spray suspension. The prepared suspension was then coated onto a flexible ITO-PEN substrate using a spray gun. Subsequently, the ITO-PEN coated with the W2C/MC film was sintered under a N2 atmosphere at 120 °C for 30 min and the flexible W2C/MC CE was achieved. The DSCs were fabricated with a photoanode, a counter electrode, and an electrolyte. The active area of the DSCs was 0.16 cm2. A symmetrical cell was fabricated with two identical CE clipping the electrolyte. The photoanode used in this work was a 12 μm thick TiO2 film sensitized with N719 dye. Two electrolytes were used in this work. The first is the I3−/I− electrolyte which contains 0.06 M Li I, 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in acetonitrile. The second is the T2/T− electrolyte which contains 0.4 M Me4N+T−, 0.4 M di-5-(1-methyltetrazole)disulfide (T2), 0.05 M LiClO4, and 0.5 M TBP in 6:4 (v/v) acetonitrile/ethylene carbonate.
5. Measurements
The current density–voltage curves (J–V) of the DSCs was measured under simulated AM 1.5 illumination (I = 100 mW cm−2, PEC-L01, Peccell, Yokohama, Japan) at the electrochemical workstation CHI 660E. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using an automatic X-ray powder diffractometer (D/Max 2400, Rigaku). The morphologies of the prepared materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, H-7650, Hitachi, Japan). EIS, Tafel-polarization, and CV measurements were characterized using an electrochemical workstation system (CHI 660E, Chenhua Shanghai). In EIS, the measured frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 1 MHz. The amplitude of the alternating current was set at 10 mV. In Tafel polarization measurements, the scan rate was 10 mV s−1. In CV measurements, Pt served as the counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ worked as the reference electrode. The T2/T− electrolyte in CV measurements contained 100 mM Me4N+T−, 10 mM T2, and 0.2 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile.
Results and discussion
1. Materials' synthesis and characterization
W2C and MC were prepared according to a previous report,26 and the experimental details are summarized in the Experimental section. A W2C phase was successfully prepared as shown by XRD patterns (Fig. 1). The diffraction peaks at 34.52, 38.03, 39.57, 52.30, 61.86, 69.77, 72.84, 74.98, 75.98, and 81.32° can be assigned to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), (201), and (004) crystal planes of W2C (Primitive hexagonal, 35-0776, PDF 2 database), respectively. To synthesize the W2C/MC composite, ammonium paratungstate was used as a W source while phenolic resin (prepared by reaction of resorcinol with formaldehyde) served as the carbon source for both the carbide and the MC. As depicted in the Experimental section, the gel precursor can be converted into the W2C/MC composite upon sintering at 1100 °C. The broad diffraction peak at 22.5° (Fig. 1) was ascribed to MC, with the rest of the peaks being associated with the W2C phase. With the aim to investigate the mechanism of formation of the W2C/MC composite, we performed sintering experiments at different temperatures (i.e., 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1100 °C). The XRD patterns (Fig. 2) showed a progressive formation of MC (400 °C), WO2 (PDF 32-1392, 600 °C) and WC (PDF 51-0939, 800 °C) phases. The complete conversion of WC into W2C was achieved at 1100 °C whereas the WC and W2C phases coexisted after sintering at 1000 °C. The diffraction peaks of 32.08, 35.86 and 47.78°, could be assigned to the crystal planes of (001), (100), (101), respectively, for WC (Body centered Cubic, 25-1407, PDF 2 database).

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (Fig. 3a) revealed spindle-shaped W2C particles of 20 (transverse) and 100 nm (longitudinal) diameters, respectively. On the other hand, the prepared W2C/MC showed a piled block surface morphology (Fig. 3b) with the W2C particles homogeneously distributed over the mesoporous-structured carbon material, as clearly revealed by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 3c and d, black contrast particles). The TEM image of MC is in Fig. S1 (ESI†), which shows a typical mesoporous structure. Furthermore, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was carried out to confirm the composition of W2C/MC. From the EDS map in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the molar ratio of C to W is 93.76:6.24, thus we can calculate the molar ratio of W2C to MC, which is around 29:1. The XRD SEM, TEM, and EDS results prove that the W2C/MC composite has been synthesized successfully.

To check the internal structures of W2C and W2C/MC, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were carried out. As shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), W2C/MC presents a typical IV pattern, implying the existence of mesoporous structures.27 Moreover, the hysteresis loop by the capillary condensation of N2 inside the pores commonly also demonstrates a mesoporous structure. The BET surface area of W2C is only 6.2 m2 g−1 with a low total pore volume of 0.013 cm3 g−1, due to the bad aggregation and large density, whereas the surface area of W2C/MC is enhanced to 327.3 m2 g−1 with a large total pore volume of 0.132 cm3 g−1. The improved surface area and pore volume significantly provide more catalytic active sites and diffusion channels for the redox couples, which benefit for high catalytic activity.
2. Application of the synthesized W2C, MC, and W2C/MC in DSCs
The as-prepared W2C/MC composite was first used in I3−/I− electrolyte-based DSCs, and this system showed a higher PCE value (7.61%) as compared to those cells involving W2C or MC separate CE components (6.44% and 6.40%). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves as well as the photovoltaic parameters of several I−/I3− electrolyte-based DSCs are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table S1 (ESI†), respectively. The intermediate product of WC/MC showed higher catalytic activity toward the iodide redox couple, and the DSCs generated a high PCE of 8.18% and the readers can acquire the details in our previous work.24
 Fig. 4  Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the iodide electrolyte based DSCs using different counter electrodes. 
Although I3−/I− is the most commonly used redox couple and W2C/MC indeed shows a satisfactory catalytic activity in the I3−/I− reaction. The iodide electrolyte has drawbacks of high corrosivity and short-wavelength light absorption.21 We therefore studied the catalytic performance of W2C/MC for the iodide-free redox couple of T2/T− (Fig. S5, ESI†).28 And the J–V curves corresponding to the MC, W2C, and W2C/MC CE materials are shown in Fig. 5a. The MC-based DSCs showed short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and PCE value of 13.24 mA cm−2, 0.536, 617 mV, and 4.38%, respectively (Table 1). The W2C-based DSCs yielded the following photovoltaic parameters: Jsc = 13.64 mA cm−2, FF = 0.607, Voc = 614 mV, and PCE = 5.08%. The W2C composite produced a low Jsc and MC gave a low FF, indicating that both W2C and MC had their own shortcomings. Utilization of the W2C/MC composite as a CE resulted in enhanced Jsc (14.19 mA cm−2) and FF (0.671) characteristics, thereby leading to superior PCE value (5.95%). The high catalytic activity while maintaining good electrical conductivity of W2C/MC can account for the observed enhancement in PCE.

3. Electro-catalytic properties of the synthesized W2C, MC, and W2C/MC
The CE catalyst impacts the DSC performance by increasing the catalytic activity and thus the electrical conductivity during the regeneration of the redox couple.29,30 In this sense, CV is a powerful tool to measure the catalytic activity. As shown in Fig. 5b, all of the three electrodes generated a typical CV profile involving a pair of redox peaks which can be ascribed to the T2/T− redox reaction in the electrolyte. In the case of separate W2C and MC, similar CV profiles were obtained involving cathodic (−0.27 and −0.30 V vs. Ag/Ag+) and anodic (0.35 and 0.62 V) peaks, respectively. When compared to the separate components, the W2C/MC composite showed a positively shifted cathodic peak (−0.25 V) whereas the anodic event was displaced to less positive potentials (0.29 V) thus leading to lower over potential and better reversibility characteristics. This fact, along with the improved current density of the W2C/MC-based DSCs, is indicative of a more effective catalytic T2/T− regeneration as compared to W2C and MC systems.
To evaluate the advantages of combining high catalytic activity and electrical conductivity of the W2C/MC composite, EIS measurements were carried out by using symmetrical cells with two identical CEs. Fig. 6a shows typical Nyquist plots of MC, W2C, and W2C/MC electrodes in which the intercept on the real axis can be attributed to the series resistance (Rs) while the left arch can be ascribed to the resistance–capacitance networks of the electrode/electrolyte interface, including the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the capacitance (Cμ). The right arch can be assigned to the diffusion resistance (ZN) of the redox couple in the electrolyte. The EIS data are summarized in Table 1. The W2C-based system showed lower Rct (5.66 vs. 7.22 Ω cm2) and ZN (6.12 vs. 48.04 Ω cm2) values as compared to the MC device, this revealing W2C to be more effective than MC for T2/T− regeneration. Most importantly, when W2C was embedded into MC, the Rct and ZN values were reduced to 2.62 Ω cm2 and 4.09 Ω cm2, respectively, leading to high catalytic redox activities and superior FF and Jsc values for the corresponding DSCs.

Finally, the Tafel polarization curve (Fig. 6b) was applied with the aim to reconfirm the catalytic activity of the W2C/MC composite catalyst. The limiting current density (Jlim) of the W2C and W2C/MC systems was higher as compared to MC, revealing higher ZN values for MC in good agreement with the EIS results. W2C/MC exhibited curves with a large slope indicating a higher exchange current density (J0) on the surface of the composite electrode as compared to W2C and MC materials. Again, this result proved W2C/MC to be more effective than W2C and MC in catalyzing the T2/T− regeneration, in agreement with previous EIS and CV results. Thus, the combination of good catalytic activity and electrical conductivity characteristics in the composite material seems to be the key to achieve superior catalytic performance.31
Conclusions
The catalytic activity can be greatly enhanced by homogeneously dispersing W2C on a mesoporous carbon to form a W2C/MC composite catalyst. The as-prepared W2C/MC performed better than the pristine W2C and MC for catalyzing T2/T− and I3−/I− regeneration and the DSCs gave PCE values of 5.96 and 7.61%. We conclude that finding an alternative to the expensive Pt is a promising way to reduce the cost of DSCs and developing a composite is an effective path to achieve highly effective catalysts.
