1 Introduction
Solar energy conversion by photocatalysis has been attracting much interest as a promising technology for a sustainable future in the context of the aggravating energy and environmental problems such as fossil fuel depletion, pollution, and global warming.1,2 Semiconductor photocatalysis as a promising technique for solar energy conversion has been widely investigated for fuel production, chemical synthesis and environmental remediation.3 However, photocatalysts still suffer from low quantum efficiency and/or poor stability.4 Remarkable strides have been made toward increasing the efficiency of solar energy conversion in the past few decades.
Graphene, a two-dimensional sp2-carbon packed monolayer with exceptional mechanical, thermal, optical, and electrical properties, has been proven to be a promising material in materials science and technology.5 Graphene-based composite materials have evolved into myriad fields ranging from energy storage and conversion,6 nanoelectronics,7 optoelectronics,8 sensors9 to bio-applications.10–16 In particular, recent years have witnessed the explosion of graphene-based photocatalyst research with improved solar-to-energy conversion efficiency.4 Using the springboard of graphene, graphene-based semiconductor composite photocatalysts have become a large field on their own.17–22 Some reviews emerged in the past few years. However, most of the previous reviews mainly focused on the applications of graphene-based photocatalysts. The fundamental science of graphene-based composite photocatalysts is far from being exhausted.23
To collect the utmost solar energy, the design of graphene-based photocatalysts at the nanoscale is of particular importance based on the scientific mantra of “structure dictates function” in chemistry.24 The rational design relies on the fundamentals of photocatalysis over graphene-based photocatalysts, especially the functionalities of graphene for the photocatalytic activity enhancement. However, a comprehensive summary of the role of graphene in the enhanced activity of graphene-based composite photocatalysts has not been available. This situation drives us to summarize recent developments of graphene-based photocatalysts from the points of: (i) preparations of graphene-based photocatalysts, (ii) typical key advances in the understanding of graphene functions for photocatalytic activity enhancement, and (iii) methodologies to regulate the electron transfer efficiency in graphene-based composite photocatalysts. This is of importance to obtain a rational and reasonable understanding of this exceptional material in photocatalysis.19 It is hoped that this minireview can be applied as a background source to understand the underlying mechanism of the photocatalytic activity enhancement and harvest the properties of graphene as a platform to construct efficient graphene-based composite photocatalysts for solar-to-energy conversion.
1.1 Mechanism and challenges of semiconductor photocatalysts

Fig. 1 shows the microscopic reaction pathways of semiconductor photocatalysis, which include three different processes.25 The reaction is first initiated by light absorption. When semiconductor photocatalysts absorb photons with energy equal to or greater than the band gap (hν ≥ Eg), electrons can be excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), generating highly reactive electrons (e−) in the conduction band while leaving positively charged holes (h+) in the valence band (Step I, denoted as SI in the following discussion). The charge carriers that migrate to the surface of photocatalysts (Step II, denoted as SII) then participate in the surface oxidation–reduction reactions (Step III, denoted as SIII) with the adsorbed reactants: the photo-generated electrons transfer to reduce the adsorbed electron acceptors (A) on the semiconductor surface while the holes oxidize the adsorbed electron donors (D) at a different location, in which the position of the conduction band and the valence band edges determines the reactivity potential of the charge carriers. However, the recombination of charge carriers (Step IV, denoted as SIV), namely the bulk recombination and the surface recombination, takes place predominantly (about 90% or more of the photogenerated electrons recombine within 10 ns) as a doom of the electron–hole pairs, which is the key issue that limits the photocatalytic activity and hinders the further development of photocatalysis.26 Therefore, it is important to increase the lifetime of electron–hole pairs to enhance the photocatalytic activity.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of photocatalysis over graphene-based composite photocatalysts, in which graphene can enhance the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, thereby boosting the photoactivity of graphene-based composite toward photooxidation and photoredox reactions. 
1.2 Why is graphene interesting?
The extraordinary properties of graphene, an allotrope of carbon consisting of one-atom-thick sp2-hybridized carbon atoms densely packed into a hexagon crystal lattice, have rapidly led the science and technology from low-dimensional nanomaterials into a 2D age. Compared with other allotropes of carbon, e.g. diamond, carbon nanotubes, and fullerene, this smart sp2-carbon packed monolayer material possesses a variety of excellent properties, such as high carrier mobility at room temperature (ca. 10000 cm2 V−1 s−1),27 a large theoretical specific surface area (2630 m2 g−1),28 good optical transparency (ca. 97.7%),29 high Young's modulus (ca. 1 TPa),30 and excellent thermal conductivity (3000–5000 W m−1 K−1).31 This single-layer hexagonal form of carbon material has been widely employed to improve the catalytic activity of photocatalysts, which can be used as a reservoir for photogenerated-electrons (Fig. 1).32,33 Because the photogenerated charge carriers are spatially separated, the recombination rate of electrons and holes is reduced and the lifetime of charge carriers is prolonged. Consequently, more oxidative holes and reductive electrons are available for the photocatalytic reactions and the photocatalytic activity is enhanced.
Besides the advantages discussed above, as the platform to design effective photocatalysts, graphene shows exceptional merits, which mainly originate from the synthesis procedure of this versatile carbon material. Since the first reporting of graphene and its manual mechanical cleavage by Scotch tape, several techniques have been developed to obtain this exceptional material. These techniques can be sorted into two categories: bottom-up methods and top-down methods. The most widely used technique is Hummers’ method34 or its derivative methods to prepare graphene oxide (GO, the precursor of graphene). By employing this method, graphene can be obtained through the reduction of GO by different strategies, such as hydrothermal reaction,35 solvothermal reaction,36 refluxing,37 and photocatalytic reduction.10,38–41 GO can be produced by the oxidation of natural graphite powder with strong chemical oxidants followed by exfoliation using ultrasonication or stirring. It is this synthesis procedure that makes graphene superior to its carbon analogues. GO usually possesses a rich assortment of oxygen-containing groups, such as carboxylic, hydroxyl, and epoxide functional groups. On the one hand, these hydrophilic oxygen-containing groups on the surface of GO make it easily dispersible in water, which facilitates the fabrication of graphene-based nanoarchitectures in aqueous solutions.42 On the other hand, the presence of sufficient oxygen functionalities in GO allows interactions with the cations and serves as reactive sites for the nucleation and growth of nanoparticles, which facilitates the preparation of various graphene-based composites.43–45 Furthermore, it offers opportunities to tune the surface properties of graphene by chemical strategies at the molecular level, such as the grafting of functional groups (amino groups and thiol groups). This chemical tunability of the graphene surface properties will broaden its application for the design of efficient photocatalysts.
Moreover, the particular two dimensional structure of graphene is an attractive option for building efficient diffusion channels of photogenerated-electrons. Photocatalysts could be anchored to both sides of graphene; in other words, more sites can be used to build the interface between photocatalysts and graphene that is vital for electron transfer. For other carbon materials, for example, one dimensional carbon (carbon nanotubes) or zero dimensional carbon (fullerene), it is relatively hard for photoactive materials to interact with the inner part. In this respect, graphene holds an unparalleled powerful advantage for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity when compared with its allotropes.
2 Preparation of graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts
The preparation is of particular importance when building uniform and efficient graphene-based photocatalysts. Metal oxide, metal sulfide, and metallate semiconductors have been fabricated on graphene for various photocatalytic applications. In this section, the synthesis procedure of semiconductor/graphene composites will be conveyed based on different types of photocatalysts, with the aim of presenting an obvious guide for the fabrication of graphene-based photocatalysts.
2.1 Synthesis of graphene-based metal oxide photocatalysts
Although a series of metal oxide semiconductors (e.g. TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, Cu2O, Fe2O3, NiO, and MnO2) shows promising photocatalytic applications, the most widely studied is still TiO2. Many preparation protocols have been developed to fabricate TiO2/graphene composite photocatalysts, as summarized in Table 1. As can be clearly seen, the two most widely used precursors of TiO2 are either water-dissolvable inorganic titanium salts (e.g. Ti(SO4)2, TiF4etc.) or titanium alkoxides that can hydrolyze easily in aqueous solution (tetrabutyl titanate, titanium isopropoxide etc.). As for the graphene ingredient, GO powder or the aqueous suspension instead of graphene itself is used in most cases. As discussed above, the reason for using GO lies in the fact that the presence of negatively charged oxygen moieties on the surface of GO increases the interaction between metal cations and GO and serves as reactive sites for the nucleation and growth of nanoparticles. GO can be readily reduced to graphene via the hydrothermal/solvothermal process or photocatalysis.38,68 If graphene is directly used, for example solvent exfoliated graphene, a surfactant such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is useful to modify the surface properties of graphene to promote the TiO2 precursor to sufficiently interact with the SEG surface.60 Furthermore, the morphology of TiO2 and the interfacial contact between TiO2 and graphene varies with the preparation conditions.

P25, a mixture of anatase TiO2 and rutile TiO2, shows more excellent photocatalytic activity than each single component owing to the nanoscale junction between two crystalline phases. Zhang et al. reported that P25 can be anchored onto the surface of graphene via a one-step hydrothermal reaction.46 In the reaction process, GO was reduced to graphene simultaneously with the loading of P25 nanoparticles on the graphene sheet. The presence of a vibration band of Ti–O–C bonds indicated that, during the hydrothermal reduction, GO, with the residual carboxylic acid functional groups, firmly interacted with the surface hydroxyl groups of P25 nanoparticles and finally formed the chemically bonded P25–graphene composites. This is also evidenced by the TEM pictures, which show that there were more P25 particles observed along the edge and wrinkles than on the basal plane since the carboxyl acid groups of GO were likely situated at the edge.69 However, this tactic severely limits the tunability of the composite properties since one species (P25) is already fixed in the binary composites.
Numerous publications indicate that titanium salts seem to be more suitable for uniformly decorating fine TiO2 nanoparticles in situ on the surface of graphene. Zhang et al. prepared particular TiO2/graphene composites with a sol–gel method using tetrabutyl titanate as the starting materials.47 It is observed that, for TiO2/graphene composites, graphene is covered with spherical anatase TiO2 with sizes from 10 to 15 nm. Using ultrasonication, Guo and co-authors, in a few hours, were successful in a controlled and uniform homogeneous incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles on the graphene layers without the use of any surfactant.48 This means that ultrasound is very effective in dispersing TiO2 nanoparticles on graphene layers. After calcination, discrete and well-defined TiO2 fully crystallized particles were uniformly scattered onto graphene sheets. It is also worth noting that by careful control of reaction conditions, Xu et al. successfully covered the individual 2D sheets of graphene with TiO2 semiconductor ingredients fully and intimately via a one-pot hydrothermal method.24 In their experiment, the key to achieving this sufficient interfacial contact is to adequately utilize the superior structure-directing role of GO with soluble inorganic salt TiF4, rather than solid P25, in an aqueous phase.
TiO2 with different well-defined morphologies has also been constructed on graphene sheets, for example, zero-dimensional TiO2 nanospheres, one-dimensional TiO2 nanorods/nanotubes, two-dimensional TiO2 nanosheets and three-dimensional macro-/meso-porous TiO2, as summarized in Table 1. In general, these TiO2 nanoarchitectures can be fabricated and then anchored onto graphene by careful control of the reaction conditions, such as the additives and hydrothermal parameters, using titanium salts as precursors of TiO2. Li et al. presented a template-free self-assembly process for the direct growth of uniform mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanospheres on graphene sheets (see Fig. 2(a)).50 According to their report, the epoxy and hydroxyl functional groups on graphene sheets acted as heterogeneous nucleation sites for anchoring anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, which resulted in the formation of well-dispersed mesoporous anatase TiO2 nanospheres on the graphene sheets (Fig. 2(b and c)). One-dimensional TiO2 nanocrystals with small size have a large surface area and a high quantum size effect, which makes them ideal candidates for photocatalytic and optoelectronic applications. Intrigued researchers prepared TiO2 nanorods or nanotubes over the entire surface of large graphene sheets.51–53 For example, as was reported by Liu et al., TiO2 nanorods stabilized by oleic acid are self-assembled on the GO sheets at the water/toluene interface.51 The self-assembled GO–TiO2 nanorod composites can be dispersed in water. The two-phase self-assembling procedure is facile and reproducible, and it can be widely and easily used for self-assembling other nonpolar organic soluble nanocrystals on large GO sheets. TiO2 nanowire arrays were also grown on the graphene substrate by a solvothermal method.67 During the synthesis procedure, titanium oxyhydrate nanoparticles were bonded on the surface of GO by the Ti–O–C bond, which were then transferred to titanium glycerolate (TiGly) in the glycerol–ethanol reaction system. TiGly complexes would gradually grow along the initial nuclei and form the subsequent long nanowire arrays on graphene. TiO2 powder can be converted to nanotubes under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of NaOH. Zhai et al. used a modification of this procedure to produce TiO2 nanotubes/graphene composites.54 TiO2 nanotubes with an average diameter of about 9 nm can hybridize with graphene via this method. With the increase of the graphene percentage, graphene sheets covered the two sides of TiO2 nanotubes. Most recently, researchers from Korea reported strongly coupled nanocomposites of layered titanate and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) synthesized by electrostatically derived self-assembly between negatively charged RGO nanosheets and positively charged TiO2 nanosols, followed by a phase transition of the anatase TiO2 component into layered titanate. The resultant composite consists of thin 2D nanoplates of lepidocrocite-type layered titanate immobilized on the surface of RGO nanosheets. The composite formation with RGO nanosheets is effective not only in promoting the phase transition of anatase TiO2 nanosols, but also in improving the thermal stability of the layered titanate, indicating the role of RGO nanosheets as an agent for directing and stabilizing layered structures.37 Zou's group has prepared TiO2–graphene 2D sandwich-like hybrid nanosheets by an in situ simultaneous reduction–hydrolysis technique in a binary ethylenediamine (En)/H2O solvent.55 The technique is based on the simultaneous reduction of GO into graphene by En and the formation of TiO2 nanoparticles through hydrolysis of titanium(IV) (ammonium lactato)dihydroxybis, resulting in in situ loading onto graphene through chemical bonds (Ti–O–C bond) to form a 2D sandwich-like nanostructure. Loh's group from the National University of Singapore has successfully made multilayered hybrid films consisting of alternating graphene and titania nanosheets using layer-by-layer electrostatic deposition followed by UV irradiation.56 Because titania and GO nanosheets are both negatively charged, positively charged protonic polyethyleneimine (PEI) was used as a linker to facilitate the assembly. A layer-by-layer assembly technique has also been used to prepare three-dimensional hollow spheres consisting of alternate titania nanosheets and graphene.59 In their protocol, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) beads were used as sacrificial templates, while PEI was used as a linker between titania nanosheets and graphene nanosheets. Finally, a microwave irradiation technique was used to simultaneously remove the template and reduce graphene oxide into graphene, and three-dimensional hollow spheres consisting of alternate titania nanosheets and graphene can be obtained (Fig. 3(b–d)). As shown in Fig. 4(a and b), Geng et al. used 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to modify TiO2 nanocrystals, producing TiO2 with a positively charged surface.65 Wrapping GO around TiO2 nanocrystals was realized by utilizing the electrostatic attraction interaction between the negatively charged GO sheets and the positively charged TiO2 (Fig. 4(c)). After thermal annealing, RGO wrapped TiO2 nanocrystals were obtained (Fig. 4(d and e)). This method suppresses the structure directing role of graphene during in situ processes,70,71 thus facilitating the photoactivity tuning of graphene-based composites by changing the geometry of semiconductors.

For nanocrystalline TiO2, it has been proved by both theoretical and experimental studies that the higher-surface-energy (001) surface has much higher chemical activity and would show greatly enhanced photocatalytic properties in the presence of {001} high energy facets. Research into fabricating high energy {001} facet-exposed nanocrystalline TiO2 on graphene has also attracted much interest recently. Hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanosheets with exposed (001) facets were ex situ incorporated with graphene by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment.61 Liu et al. and Wang et al. developed hydrothermal and solvothermal methods for the synthesis of {001} faceted TiO2/graphene hybrids separately, during which hydrofluoric acid (HF) was introduced to direct the growth of TiO2 nanocrystals.62,63 Furthermore, a fluorine-containing titanium salt, (NH4)2TiF6, was used as a precursor via a facile and simple way to synthesize graphene@TiO2 nanocomposites with controlled crystal facets by a one-pot hydrothermal process.64 It was found that the concentration of (NH4)2TiF6 precursor solutions can also affect the morphologies of graphene@TiO2 nanocomposites. By control experiments, they found that F− anions generated by the hydrolysis of (NH4)2TiF6 could be preferentially adsorbed into the {001} facets of TiO2 nanocrystals and limit the growth along the c-axis.
Apart from TiO2, many other metal oxides (e.g. SnO2,72–74 ZnO,75–77 Cu2O,78 Fe2O3,79 NiO,80 MnO281 and ZrO2) have been successfully fabricated on a graphene surface. Compared with that of TiO2, the procedure to prepare these semiconductor/graphene composites are easier since more water-soluble metal salts can be chosen. As discussed above, the dissociated cations Mn+ (Zn2+, Sn2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Mn2+etc.) can pre-adsorb on graphene oxide via the interaction with negatively charged oxygen moieties. Many chemical strategies are then employed to convert these Mn+/graphene to M2On/graphene nanocomposites, such as a hydrothermal method82 and refluxing.76
2.2 Synthesis of graphene-based metal sulfide photocatalysts
Several metal sulfides have been successfully fabricated on graphene sheets, such as CdS,83–87 In2S3,88 CuS,89 ZnIn2S4,90 ZnxCd1−xS,91 and MoS2.92 In summary, two interesting organic compounds were generally employed as sulphur precursors. One was L-cysteine, which is an amino acid that contains three functional groups (–SH, –NH2, and –COO–) and has a high affinity for cations owing to the presence of –SH.88,89L-Cysteine can release H2S when heated, which acts as a sulphur source as well as a reducing agent, resulting in the formation of metal sulfide nanoparticles and the reduction of GO to RGO.89 It should be mentioned that L-cysteine also plays the role of a linker to anchor Cu2+ for the well-distributed growth of the CuS nanoparticles on the RGO sheets in their system. The other S-source was dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).83 During the thermal treatment, DMSO can slowly release S2− ions, which is the sulphur source. Furthermore, many metal halides are dissolvable in DMSO, thus it can be used as the solvent directly. Thiourea is another alternative sulphur source that can be used.87 Like L-cysteine, thiourea can also release H2S when heated.
Xu et al. prepared CdS/graphene composites by a facile solvothermal method in the media of DMSO, during which the formation of CdS nanoparticles and the reduction of GO occur simultaneously.83 It is found that graphene nanosheets are able to serve as a two-dimensional “mat” with which the CdS nanoparticles interact to hinder the aggregation. By comparing the morphology of CdS/graphene samples with different weight contents of graphene, it is clearly suggested that the introduction of an appropriate amount of graphene to synthesize the CdS/graphene nanocomposite is of great importance for achieving a good and homogeneous distribution of CdS nanoparticles on the two-dimensional graphene scaffold. Zn0.8Cd0.2S was also successfully loaded on RGO by a simple and environmentally friendly coprecipitation–hydrothermal strategy using Cd(Ac)2·2H2O, Zn(Ac)2·2H2O, and Na2S as precursors in the presence of GO.91 To deposit the solid solution sulfide (Zn0.8Cd0.2S) on RGO, an aqueous suspension of GO was added into the mixture of Cd(Ac)2·2H2O and Zn(Ac)2·2H2O in water. After that, a Na2S solution was added dropwise followed by stirring for 2 h at room temperature. The suspension was then hydrothermally treated at 160 °C for 4 h and Zn0.8Cd0.2S/RGO composites were obtained after washing and drying. Wu and co-authors deposited p-type MoS2 nanoplatelets on the n-type nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (n-RGO) nanosheets by a solvothermal method at 200 °C for 10 h using (NH4)2MoS4, L-ascorbic acid and GO dispersed in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as the starting materials.92 The p-MoS2/n-RGO heterostructure shows significant photocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the wavelength range from ultraviolet light through near-infrared light.
2.3 Synthesis of metallate/graphene composite photocatalysts
Many other semiconductor photocatalysts have been constructed on graphene, such as Bi2WO6,93,94 BiVO4,95 γ-Bi2MoO6,96,97 Sr2Ta2O7,98 ZnFe2O4,99 MnFe2O4,100 CoFe2O4,101 BiOBr,102,103 BiOI,104 Bi5Nb3O15,105 La2Ti2O7,106 ZnWO4,107 and InNbO4.108 Most preparations of these metallate/graphene composites are conducted under hydrothermal conditions. Some composite photocatalysts are prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. Fu et al. used Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O as precursors of CoFe2O4, and GO as a source of graphene sheets.101 During the hydrothermal reaction process, GO was reduced to graphene, and simultaneously CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were formed on the graphene sheets. CoFe2O4 nanoparticles have magnetic properties, which make the CoFe2O4/graphene composite magnetically separable in a suspension system, and therefore it does not require additional magnetic components as is usually the case. Other magnetically separable materials such as MnFe2O4100 and ZnFe2O499 were also fabricated on graphene by the same method. The one-step hydrothermal method can also be successfully used for the synthesis of Bi2WO6,93,94 BiVO4,95 and γ-Bi2MoO697 loaded graphene composites. Ye et al. reported the synthesis of Bi2WO6/RGO composites by an in situ reaction.94 In a typical experiment, Na2WO4·2H2O, Bi(NO3)3·6H2O and GO (dispersed in water) were added successively into distilled water under vigorous stirring followed by 30 min ultrasonication, and sodium alginate solution was added slowly. After being stirred for 3 h, the suspension was sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 16 h. Bi2WO6/RGO composites were obtained after washing and drying processes. Bi2MoO6/RGO composite photocatalysts have been successfully fabricated by a one-pot solvothermal method.97 The Bi-precursor Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was dissolved in ethylene glycol, which was mixed with GO dispersed in ethylene glycol under vigorous stirring. After that, Na2MoO4·2H2O as the Mo-precursor was added to the mixture to form a suspension, which was hydrothermally treated at 160 °C for 12 h before the Bi2MoO6/RGO composite formed. In other cases, semiconductor nanoparticles are prepared and incorporated with graphene by an ex situ integration method under different conditions.102–108 A simple surface charge modified self-assembly approach was applied to prepare two-dimensional (2D) SnNb2O6 nanosheet/graphene composites featuring a typical 2D–2D structure.109 After the reduction of GO by branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) through refluxing, modified graphene nanosheets with a positively charged surface can be obtained. The electrostatic attractive interaction between negatively charged SnNb2O6 nanosheets and positively charged graphene in an aqueous solution enables the efficient self-assembly process to prepare the SnNb2O6/graphene composites with a sheet-on-sheet structure. Liu et al. reported a GO enwrapped Ag3PO4 composite as a visible-light-induced photocatalyst fabricated by an ion-exchange method of CH3COOAg and Na2HPO4 in the presence of GO sheets, which could serve as a support and a surfactant to enwrap Ag3PO4 particles.110
3 Functions of graphene for photocatalytic activity enhancement
Graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts show wide applications, such as environmental remediation,32,46,87 organic synthesis55,59,60,83,84,111 and water splitting.47,53,78,86,112,113 Besides the effort to combine graphene with semiconductor photocatalysts to enhance their photocatalytic performance, numerous attempts have been made to reveal the origin of the activity enhancement, which in turn provides fundamental science to construct graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts with higher photoactivities. This section will discuss recent advances regarding the functions of graphene for photocatalytic activity enhancement.
3.1 Enhanced adsorptivity for reactants
Surface adsorption is a prerequisite for photocatalytic processes. A previous report showed that graphene/rod-shaped TiO2 nanocomposite samples with high BET surface area exhibit higher photocatalytic performance toward the degradation of methyl orange (MO) than P25 as well as pure rod-shaped TiO2 nanocrystals.52 The enhanced physical adsorption of molecules, owing to the higher BET surface, contributes to the photoactivity improvement. Zhang et al. found that there were no significant changes in the BET specific area among the three catalysts, though the adsorption strength of the P25 decorated graphene composite (P25/graphene) is better than that of bare P25 and P25/carbon nanotubes (P25/CNTs), as shown in Fig. 5(a), which indicated that the adsorptivity should not merely originate from simple physical adsorption.46 The enhanced adsorptivity should be largely assigned to the selective adsorption of the aromatic dye on the catalyst. Since the basal graphene plane was not fully covered by P25 (Fig. 5(b)), it is reasonable to conclude that the adsorption was noncovalent and driven by the π–π stacking between methylene blue (MB) and aromatic regions of the graphene, which was similar to the conjugation between aromatic molecules and CNTs. In addition, the P25–graphene showed better adsorption of MB than P25–CNTs, mainly owing to its giant π-conjugation system and two-dimensional planar structure, and therefore exhibited faster photodegradation of the dyes. However, this work did not consider the effect of different addition ratios of graphene into the matrix of TiO2 on changing the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Xu et al. prepared a series of P25–graphene (P25–GR) composites with different graphene addition ratios and demonstrated that with the increase of graphene in the P25–GR nanocomposites, the adsorption of methylene blue increases correspondingly (Fig. 5(c)).32 This can be ascribed to the increased exposure of graphene in the composite, resulting in favorable π–π interactions between methylene blue and graphene.

The adsorption behavior of reactants over graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts depends critically on the coupling pattern between semiconductors and graphene. Xu et al. prepared CdS/graphene composites (CdS/GR) by a facile solvothermal method (Fig. 6(a)) and found that, although the CdS/GR composite exhibited a much improved photocatalytic activity toward the selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols, the adsorption capacity for aromatic alcohols over the CdS/GR composite is almost the same as for blank CdS, as shown in Fig. 6(b).83 This may be attributed to the shielding effect of CdS that caused the graphene surface to be densely covered by the CdS component (Fig. 6(c)). As a result, the interaction between aromatic alcohols and graphene via π–π stacking is spatially blocked and no obvious adsorptivity improvement was observed.

3.2 Extended light absorption range
Light absorption is of importance since photocatalysis is initiated by photoexcitation. Many reports indicate that graphene is able to extend the light absorption range of semiconductors. One possible underlying mechanism may be surface carbon doping because of the chemical bonding between the semiconductor and graphene.84 The surface carbon doping effect of graphene often leads to the light absorption edge extension of TiO2 from the ultraviolet range to the visible range, thus making the TiO2/graphene composite a visible-light-responsive photocatalyst. As reported by Li et al.,46 the Ti–O–C vibration absorption band was observed in their Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra and an obvious red shift of ca. 30–40 nm in the absorption edge of P25–graphene powder, compared with bare P25, which is similar to the case of carbon doped TiO2 composites.114 Ti–O–C is also observed in other reports, which can extend the photo-response from the ultraviolet region to the visible light region.48,54,61,115–118
Besides the TiO2/graphene system, an extension of the light absorption range was also observed in the CdS/graphene system. It was reported that the band gap of the semiconductor CdS is narrowed owing to the introduction of graphene into the matrix of CdS/graphene nanocomposites because of the chemical bonding between CdS and graphene.83 Based on the Kubelka–Munk function versus the energy of light, the estimated band gap values of the samples are about 2.46, 2.43, 2.34, 2.33, and 2.24 eV approximately, corresponding to blank CdS, CdS–1% graphene, CdS–5% graphene, CdS–10% graphene, and CdS–30% graphene nanocomposites, respectively. A similar phenomenon of band gap narrowing has also been observed for ZnS/graphene nanocomposites.111
3.3 Photosensitizer/photon-absorber
The above results showed that graphene addition may lead to band gap narrowing of the semiconductor owing to the chemical bonding between the semiconductor and graphene, which results in the extended light absorption range. It is also worth noting that recent large-scale density functional calculations on the model of the graphene/TiO2(110) interface, along with the experimental proof from the wavelength-dependent photocurrent study, have suggested the possible role of graphene as a photosensitizer for TiO2.119 The new role of graphene as the sensitizer opens a promising wide scope to exploit the potential applications of graphene-based semiconductors. However, experimentally, the photocurrent measurement alone cannot be sufficient to prove whether or not graphene acts as a photosensitizer for a semiconductor during a photocatalytic process for the graphene/TiO2(110) system, since this work does not exclude the effect of a Ti–O–C bond being formed between TiO2 and graphene, that is, surface carbon doping which leads to the light absorption edge extension of TiO2 from the ultraviolet range to the visible range. Xu's group confirmed by detailed experiments the role of graphene in the ZnS/graphene (ZnS/GR) nanocomposites as an organic dye-like macromolecular “photosensitizer” for ZnS instead of an electron reservoir.111 It was found that ZnS/GR nanocomposites exhibit visible light photoactivity toward aerobic selective oxidation of alcohols and epoxidation of alkenes under ambient conditions, as exemplified in Fig. 7(a). However, ZnS by itself shows very poor photoactivity towards the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. Unlike the TiO2/graphene system, as indicated in Fig. 7(b and c), the optical measurement of ZnS/GR indicates that the wide band gap of ZnS is narrowed to some degree, but still not enough for the visible light region. Consequently, it can be inferred that graphene may act as a visible light photosensitizer to ZnS in the nanocomposite of ZnS/GR. In other words, under visible light irradiation, photoexcited electrons are generated from graphene and then transferred to the conduction band of ZnS, which therefore transforms the wide band gap ZnS to a visible light photocatalyst. The controlled experiments using different radical scavengers shown in Fig. 7(d) support the inference on the role of graphene as a macromolecular organic dye-like photosensitizer to ZnS for ZnS–5% GR. It is interesting to note that the addition of the ammonium oxalate (AO) scavenger for holes has a negligible effect on the conversion of benzyl alcohol, thus indicating that holes do not involve the oxidation of benzyl alcohol. This result is in accordance with the proposed photocatalytic mechanism that graphene acts as a visible light photosensitizer in ZnS–5% GR during which no holes are generated because ZnS cannot be band-gap-photoexcited by visible light irradiation. When the AgNO3 scavenger for electrons is added, conversion of substrate reactants is remarkably inhibited. Similarly, the addition of the benzoquinone (BQ) scavenger for superoxide radicals also significantly prohibits the conversion. Besides, a controlled experiment under an inert N2-saturated atmosphere implies that only trace conversion is obtained. Thus, these controlled experiments suggest that (i) oxygen is the primary oxidant in the photocatalytic oxidation system, and (ii) photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols or alkenes over ZnS–5% GR under visible light irradiation can be understood by a graphene-induced photosensitization process.

Graphene also exhibits strong near-infrared (NIR) absorbance and was applied for NIR photothermal therapy of cancer.15,120 Akhavan et al. developed a magneto-photothermal therapy for cancer using superparamagnetic zinc ferrite spinel (ZnFe2O4)–RGO nanostructures (with various RGO contents).15In vitro application of a low concentration (10 μg mL−1) of the ZnFe2O4–RGO (20 wt%) nanostructures under a short time period (∼1 min) of NIR irradiation (with a laser power of 7.5 W cm−2) resulted in an excellent destruction of the prostate cancer cells, in the presence of a magnetic field (∼1 Tesla) used for localizing the nanomaterials at the laser spot. The reported results may stimulate more application of magnetic graphene-containing composites in highly efficient photothermal therapy.
3.4 Electron transfer mediator
The calculated Fermi level (EF) of graphene is −0.08 V versus NHE, which is more positive than the ECB of most semiconductors.93,121 Consequently, photogenerated electrons will spontaneously transfer from semiconductors to graphene nanosheets when they come into contact. Furthermore, graphene has a high charge-carrier mobility of 250000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, so electrons can transfer in the network of graphene with ease and unconstrained. Based on these two features, the most widely acceptable role of graphene in photocatalytic activity enhancement is as the electron transfer mediator, i.e., photo-generated electrons from a semiconductor will thermodynamically migrate to graphene, where they are then captured by electron-acceptors. Consequently, the electron–hole pair separation rate can be significantly enhanced.
In an ideal system, the quantum yield (ϕ), which indicates the efficiency of the photocatalytic process, is proportional to the following:ϕ ∝ kCT/(kCT + kR)where kCT is the rate of the charge transfer processes and kR indicates the electron–hole recombination rate (both bulk and surface). The above relationship between ϕ and kR indicates that graphene can enhance the photocatalytic efficiency by reducing the recombination of electron–hole pairs.122 The electrons transferred to graphene are consumed by miscellaneous acceptors, which increase the photocatalytic performances toward different applications. On the one hand, photo-excited electrons from semiconductors to graphene can be further transferred to surface adsorbed O2 by either a one-electron transfer process to form superoxide radical species or a two-electron transfer process to form H2O2,123 which can be used for the selective transformation of alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes or environmental remediations.20 On the other hand, the spatially separated excited electrons can directly reduce the nitro compounds adsorbed on graphene,124 or H+ to realize photocatalytic H2 production.22 In addition, Wu et al. reported the preparation of α-Fe2O3/graphene composites for photocatalytic water oxidation.126 Investigations show that electron transfer to the graphene could increase the charge separation and suppress the charge recombination, leaving long-lived holes in the α-Fe2O3 to oxidize water, increasing the photocatalytic water splitting rate.
The improved electron–hole separation efficiency by graphene can also lead to enhanced photocatalytic performances in biology, such as antibacterial,10,16 antiviral,11 anti-parasitical applications,12 and photostimulation of stem cells.13,14 Akhavan's group conducted extensive investigations on the bio-applications of graphene-based composite photocatalysts. For example, they prepared TiO2/RGO thin films by depositing GO onto TiO2 thin films followed by calcination.10 The TiO2/RGO thin films exhibited enhanced performance in the degradation of Escherichia coli bacteria compared to bare TiO2 films. Moreover, as a result of the electron transfer from TiO2 to RGO, the residual oxygen-containing functional groups on RGO can be reduced by the accumulated photo-excited electrons. Vertical aligned ZnO nanowires and WO3 have been also successfully integrated with graphene for the visible-light photo-inactivation of bacteria16 and bacteriophage MS2 viruses11 with enhanced photocatalytic performance. RGO sheets deposited on a TiO2 film worked as a biocompatible layer for accelerated neuronal differentiation of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in the presence of a biocompatible hole scavenger.12 The effective electrical coupling between the TiO2 and the RGO, through the Ti–C and Ti–O–C bonds formed in the TiO2/RGO composites, as well as between the RGO sheets and hNSCs provided not only more proliferation of the cells (by a factor of ∼2.5) but also more differentiation of hNSCs into neurons than glia (in total, ∼23-fold increase in the neural to glial cell ratio), under flash photo stimulation. Furthermore, Akhavan et al. proceeded to incorporate TiO2 with graphene nanogrids for the differentiation of human neural stem cells into neural networks.13 A higher differentiation on the reduced graphene oxide nanoribbon (RGONR) grids than RGO sheets was observed, which can be assigned to the physical stress induced by the surface topographic features of the nanogrids.
Because of its large two-dimensional mat-like structure with a size of several micrometers, the possibility of using graphene as the conductive medium to interface the H2 and O2 photocatalysts was explored, and it was found that this perfectly interpreted its function as an interparticulate electron transfer mediator.125 In the report, the effectiveness of reduced graphene oxide as a solid electron mediator for water splitting in the Z-scheme photocatalysis system is demonstrated. As illustrated in Fig. 8(a and b), a tailor-made, photoreduced graphene oxide can shuttle photogenerated electrons from an O2-evolving photocatalyst (BiVO4) to a H2-evolving photocatalyst (Ru/SrTiO3:Rh), tripling the consumption of electron–hole pairs in the water splitting reaction under visible-light irradiation (Fig. 8(c)). This work has paved a new way of using the attractive graphene in the design of new and efficient systems for water splitting. Lu et al. have also demonstrated that graphene can play an important role as an electron transfer highway, which facilitates the charge carrier collection onto Pt cocatalysts. The quantum efficiency for Sr2Ta2O7−xNx with the Pt cocatalyst in the wavelength of 280–550 nm was calculated to be 4.26%. This value was further improved to 6.45% (∼177% increase compared with the value of 2.33% for undoped Sr2Ta2O7) when Pt-loaded graphene scaffolds were incorporated into the Sr2Ta2O7−xNx photocatalyst.98

The role of graphene as an efficient electron transfer enables the prolonged stability of photocatalysts, such as ZnO,127–130 Ag3PO4131 and plasmonic Cu.132 Ag3PO4, a highly efficient photocatalyst for O2 generation from water splitting and organic dye degradation under visible light irradiation, suffers from poor cyclability because of photocatalytic reduction of Ag+ to Ag. The work by Yang and co-authors demonstrated that the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the surface of Ag3PO4 to graphene sheets also reduces the possibility of decomposing Ag+ to metallic Ag, promising an improved stability of the recyclable Ag3PO4–graphene composite photocatalyst.131 Copper is a low-cost plasmonic metal, which can gain visible light energy through the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect to improve the yield of photocatalytic chemical synthesis. Although Cu nanoparticles exhibit strong LSPR absorption in the visible light range and are catalytically active for many reactions such as the catalytic hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate, the primary challenge for Cu nanoparticles to be used as photocatalysts is their chemical stability under catalytic reaction conditions. Cu nanoparticles are easily oxidized to Cu2O or CuO in air or in the presence of traces of molecular oxygen. Recent investigations suggest that graphene can be used as a support to stabilize Cu nanoparticles susceptible to oxidation, which are feasible for igniting and promoting the coupling reactions of aromatic nitro compounds to the corresponding azoxy or azo compounds under visible-light irradiation.132 This work may lead to the revisiting of this low-cost plasmonic metal as a photocatalyst for solar energy conversion.
4 Materials engineering towards improving the electron transfer efficiency in graphene-based photocatalysts
To harness the role of graphene as an electron transfer mediator, the optimization of interfacial electron transfer from semiconductors to graphene and the electron transfer within graphene by rational material design deserves more effort, which will ultimately enhance the quantum efficiency of graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts.
Xu and co-workers conceptually proved that TiO2/graphene composites with intimate interfacial contact exhibit significantly higher visible light photoactivity toward selective oxidation of alcohols than their counterpart with poor interfacial contact, which paves the way for enhancing the performance of graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts by interfacial electron transfer engineering.24 Zeng et al. have recently prepared chemically bonded TiO2/graphene through the Ti–C bond, which could provide a good spatial condition for charge transport from TiO2 to graphene via the interfaces, and decrease the possibility of recombination of electron–hole pairs, and thus lead to higher photocatalytic activity towards photodegradation of formaldehyde in air.133 Additionally, Xu et al. showed a proof-of-concept study on improving the photocatalytic performance of TiO2/graphene nanocomposites via a combined strategy of decreasing the defects of graphene and improving the interfacial contact between graphene and the semiconductor TiO2.60 The solvent exfoliated graphene (SEG) in N,N-dimethyl-formamide (DMF) has much lower defect density, which endows SEG with improved electrical mobility and a longer electronic mean free path. This decreases the likelihood of recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the SEG-P25 nanocomposite upon light irradiation.134 The utilization of SEG instead of GO as the precursor of graphene along with strengthening interfacial contact between TiO2 and the graphene surface is a feasible approach to improve the photocatalytic performance of TiO2/graphene. It enables sufficient harnessing of the electron conductivity of graphene to achieve a more efficient TiO2/graphene nanocomposite with enhanced photoactivity for the synthesis of fine chemicals by selective oxidation under ambient conditions.
A more encouraging work by Xu et al. demonstrated a simple and general approach to improve the transfer efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers across the interface between graphene and semiconductor CdS by introducing a small amount of metal ions (Ca2+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) as “mediators” into their interfacial layer matrix, while the intimate interfacial contact between graphene and CdS is maintained (Fig. 9(a)). Metal ions as generic interfacial mediators can significantly improve the visible-light-driven photoactivity of CdS/graphene (CdS/GR) semiconductor composites for targeting selective photoredox reaction, including aerobic oxidation of alcohol (Fig. 9(b)). Without the presence of metal ions as interfacial mediators in the composites, CdS–GR with 5% graphene exhibited the optimum efficiency for the selective conversion of benzyl alcohol. In contrast, for the optimal CdS–(GR–M) photocatalysts, the weight addition ratio of graphene is remarkably increased to 10 or 30%. This suggests that the metal ions as interfacial mediators can also drive the balance between the positive effect of graphene on retarding the recombination of electron–hole pairs photogenerated from the semiconductor and the negative “shielding effect” of graphene as a result of the high weight addition of graphene.135 As evidenced by photoluminescence spectra shown in Fig. 9(c), the introduction of metal ions as interfacial mediators between graphene and CdS can significantly optimize the charge carrier transfer pathway across the interface between CdS and graphene and thus prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers. As a result, the negative shielding effect of a higher amount of graphene can be counterbalanced effectively and the photoactivity of CdS/GR is significantly improved. Fig. 9(d) shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots of a series of electrodes. As compared to blank CdS, the optimal CdS–(GR–M) (M = Ca2+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) electrodes exhibit more depressed semicircles at high frequencies than CdS–5% GR, indicating that smaller resistance and more efficient transfer of charge carriers are obtained over the optimal CdS–(GR–M) (M = Ca2+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) than those over CdS–5% GR. The EIS results show that the addition of metal ions is also able to promote the transfer efficiency of charge carriers across the interface between graphene and semiconductor CdS.

Most recently, the interfacial electron transfer mediator was stepped from metal ions to noble metal palladium (Pd), which can optimize spatial charge carrier transfer across the interface between the semiconductor (CdS) and graphene.136 One of the roles of Pd is to serve as an electron reservoir to directly trap photogenerated electrons from CdS. Another role is as an interfacial mediator to promote electron relay in the ternary CdS–(graphene–Pd) photocatalysts along with conductive graphene as dual co-catalysts. This work substantiates the feasibility of adopting the “interfacial-mediator” strategy to optimize the interfacial charge carrier transfer pathway and efficiency for improved photoactivity of graphene–semiconductor nanocomposites toward target photoredox reactions.
The interfacial contact between graphene and the semiconductor can be strengthened by surface modification. The principle is to assemble the semiconductor with graphene by utilizing the electrostatic attraction interaction. After modification of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) or branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI),109 semiconductors (e.g. TiO2,46 ZnO,109 CdS,137 In2S3,138 and SnNb2O6109) are abundant with positively charged amine groups, which provide substantial electrostatic interaction between negatively charged GO or graphene. The enhanced interfacial interaction contributes to the improved photoactivity of the graphene-based composite photocatalyst toward different photoredox and photooxidation reactions.
Assembly of graphene into interconnected networks provides efficient 3D transfer pathways for photo-generated electrons, which reduces the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the hierarchically porous structure can facilitate the mass transfer and offer a large accessible surface area.139 Zhang et al. reported a simple one-step hydrothermal method toward in situ growth of ultradispersed mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystals with (001) facets on 3D porous graphene.140 This method uses glucose as the dispersant and linker owing to its hierarchically porous structure and high surface area. The strong interaction between TiO2 and graphene, the facet characteristics, the high electrical conductivity, and the 3D hierarchically porous structure of these composites result in highly active photocatalysis.
5 Summary and perspectives
Research into graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts is gaining momentum. Although graphene-based photocatalysts have been widely investigated, key concepts to further enhance the photocatalytic performances show promising opportunities to rationally design graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts as the next-generation artificial photosynthesis systems with high performance.
Firstly, the band-gap opening of graphene could open a wide scope of graphene for photocatalytic applications. Some strategies have been developed to open up a band-gap in graphene, such as heteroatom doping,141 and processing graphene sheets into nanoribbons142 or nanomeshes.143–146 Among them, doping graphene with nitrogen has been proved to be an effective method for material engineering toward different photocatalytic applications.92,147–155 For example, it was reported that nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) is an excellent support of the ZnSe photocatalyst; this as-synthesized composite exhibited remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activities for the bleaching of the methyl orange dye under visible-light irradiation.155 Besides the advantages of better adsorption ability and extended absorption range of light brought by NG, the effect of p–n junctions between NG and ZnSe is another key to improving the photoactivity. However, a rational comparison between graphene and NG regarding the improvement of photocatalytic activity is highly sought, which may in turn facilitate the utilization of NG for photocatalytic applications.
Secondly, morphology control of graphene-based nanoarchitectures is expected to further improve the photocatalytic performance. Materials engineering should aim to enhance the light absorption, improve the mass transportation, and increase the accessible surface area. For example, the hollow structure may also act as a photon trap-well to allow the multi-scattering of incident light for the enhancement of light absorption.59 Thus, more charge carriers can be generated by the incident photons, which will increase the apparent quantum efficiency of photocatalysts.
The advent of robust graphene is sure to make graphene–semiconductor composite photocatalysts promising candidates for solar energy storage and conversion. However, as emphasized by Xu et al., only by material designing at a system level can we construct the next generation of artificial photocatalytic systems based on graphene–semiconductor photocatalysts with high performance.17 To be specific, optimizing the structural and electronic properties of each component and enhancing the interfacial electron transfer at the nanoscale simultaneously and harmoniously are critical for the overall photocatalytic activity of graphene-based semiconductor photocatalysts.
