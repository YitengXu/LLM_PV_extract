    , Accepted 4th February 2022First published on 16th March 2022AbstractSuperior electrochemical properties and high flexibility are two crucial requirements and challenges for electrochemical capacitors (ECs) applied in flexible and wearable electronics. Here a low-cost and scalable method is proposed for the fabrication of mechanically exfoliated graphite paper (MEGP), which shows unique layered microstructures. The MEGP is subsequently used as a current collector to directly load multi-walled carbon nanotube@polypyrrole (MWCNT@PPy) core–shell hybrids as active materials, by electro-codeposition. The resultant MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes demonstrate substantially enhanced electrochemical properties compared to GP/MWCNT@PPy, owing to the 3D interface constructed between layered MEGP and MWCNT@PPy. The symmetrical EC assembled using MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes achieves an areal capacitance of 101.5 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2, and an ideal rate capability. It also shows an electrochemical stability of 87.1% after 10000 cycles, and retains 95.1% of the initial capacitance after enduring harsh mechanical deformation 400 times. These results indicate that the EC device has superior electrochemical properties and high flexibility with great potential for utilization in flexible and wearable electronic devices. The MEGP we have developed not only ensures the high flexibility of the device, but also boosts its electrochemical performance.
Introduction
Flexible and wearable electronic devices with personalization and functionalities have been gaining the favor of consumers. The applications include wearable displays, electronic paper, roll-up solar cells, electronic skin, personal health-monitoring devices, and so on.1–3 The rapidly growing demands of portability have triggered the development of flexible energy storage devices, which replace the external power supply that needs to be connected using long cables.4,5 Electrochemical capacitors (ECs), also referred to as supercapacitors, are regarded as one type of energy storage device that have high application potential as power sources for flexible electronics. They offer several advantages over traditional electrochemical energy storage devices such as batteries, including fast charge–discharge ability and long lifespan.6,7 Nevertheless, for their commercialization, superior electrochemical properties and high flexibility are two crucial requirements and challenges for flexible ECs.8,9
Flexible ECs usually consist of flexible current collectors, active materials, and a quasi-solid state electrolyte. Their electrochemical properties are largely determined by active materials. Thus, great efforts are dedicated to designing and preparing active materials with unique microstructures, which shorten the ion diffusion path and result in larger specific capacitance and higher rate performance.10,11 The material selections include electric double-layer capacitive carbonaceous materials (such as carbon nanotubes and graphene), pseudo-capacitive conducting polymers (polypyrrole and polyaniline) and transition metal oxides (MnO2 and V2O5).12–15 As one kind of conducting polymer, polypyrrole (PPy) attracts considerable interest owing to its high theoretical specific capacitance, good solubility in water, low oxidation potential, and environmental stability. However, PPy grows densely and results in compact microstructures, which consequently prolong the ion diffusion path to interior active materials and cause large “dead volume”. Furthermore, the poor cycling stability following the repeated doping and de-doping of counter anions also restricts its applications in ECs.16,17 Among one-dimensional carbon materials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) feature high conductivity, large specific surface area, high cycling stability, and ideal mechanical strength.18,19 Therefore, it is attractive to change the compact microstructures of PPy and promote its cycling stability by incorporating CNTs.
To date, the reported preparation processes of hybrids composed of PPy and CNTs include chemical or electrochemical routes.20–25 The chemical methods commonly use active materials in powders, and then an insulating binder is used to build electrodes. In contrast, binder-free electrodes can be fabricated via electrochemical methods, in which active materials can be directly loaded on current collectors, thus enabling the electrodes to achieve improved electrochemical properties. Stepwise electrochemical methods are generally employed to construct the hybrids of PPy and CNTs. Here CNTs are firstly coated on current collectors, after which PPy is electropolymerized to composite with CNTs. However, the inferior dispersity of CNTs in water would lead to aggregation, thereby limiting the specific surface area. In this work, an electro-codeposition method has been developed to load active materials, that is, CNT-PPy hybrids, on current collectors. Acid-treated CNTs with high dispersibility in water are used, accordingly taking full advantage of the large specific surface area and decreasing the “dead volume” of PPy.
High flexibility is the other crucial requirement for flexible ECs which are able to undergo various mechanical deformations without deteriorating their energy storage performance. As one of the key components, current collectors can significantly affect the flexibility of the device.26,27 Selecting a flexible current collector with low cost and high conductivity is indispensable for the commercialization of flexible ECs. Metal foils and carbon-based materials are currently widely used as flexible current collectors.28–30 Metal foils have high conductivity and flexibility, but their weakness of high weight results in a final heavy device. Carbon-based materials, such as graphene film and carbon cloth, are highly conductive, flexible, and light-weight. Yet they are expensive due to the high fabrication cost. As one of the carbon-based current collectors, graphite paper (GP) has potential for commercial utilization in flexible ECs, since it features high conductivity and low price.31,32 Current collectors play a crucial role in affecting the charge transfer ability of active materials. Nevertheless, few investigations have been carried out to enhance the electrochemical properties of flexible ECs from the view of modifying current collectors. Some recent studies indicate that the ECs have superior electrochemical properties through using 3D collectors, such as Ni micromesh and Al foam.33,34 Hence it is very promising to improve the electrochemical properties of flexible ECs by transforming the surface of GP from 2D to 3D. Prior studies show that electrochemically oxidative exfoliation/expansion is an effective method to construct GP with a 3D surface.35,36 However, the graphitic crystal structure is severely destroyed owing to the introduced oxygen-containing groups via electrochemical treatments, leading to considerable decline of the conductivity of GP. Moreover, electrochemical treatments are tedious and time-consuming, going against large-scale production. Therefore, it is appealing to develop a time-saving, cost-effective and scalable method without deteriorating conductivity, which can fabricate GP with a 3D surface as a flexible current collector.
In this contribution, we report on the fabrication of mechanically exfoliated graphite paper (MEGP), by physical exfoliation using a commercial adhesive tape and subsequent ultrasonic treatment. The method is low-cost and scalable, and has been inspired by mechanical exfoliation from graphite to graphene.37 The obtained MEGP shows a unique layered microstructure, with an observably enlarged surface area. Multi-walled carbon nanotube@polypyrrole (MWCNT@PPy) core–shell hybrids serve as active materials, which are electro-codeposited on the MEGP current collector. The introduction of MWCNTs is shown to thoroughly change the compact microstructures of PPy. The MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes have distinctly enhanced supercapacitive performances relative to GP/MWCNT@PPy. The constructed flexible solid-state MEGP/MWCNT@PPy EC shows impressive electrochemical behaviors and high flexibility. The MEGP we developed ensures the high flexibility of the EC device and simultaneously enhances its electrochemical properties.
Experimental section
Electrode preparation
The preparation of MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes includes the fabrication of MEGP current collectors and the subsequent electro-codeposition of MWCNT@PPy hybrid films onto MEGP. For the former step, a piece of commercial 3M adhesive tape (0.04 mm in thickness) was first adhered onto one side of GP (20 mm × 10 mm × 0.1 mm in length, width, and thickness, respectively) to obtain a highly flexible GP current collector. Then, MEGP current collector was prepared from the GP current collector by mechanical exfoliation. In particular, a piece of adhesive tape was tightly pressed on the GP current collector, followed by peeling off slowly as shown in Fig. 1a, during which a very thin graphite layer (∼20 μm in thickness) was peeled off from the GP surface due to the strong adhesion of the adhesive tape. Subsequently, ultrasonication in deionized water was performed for 2 min to further exfoliate the graphite sheets on the GP surface. It turns out that the current collector changes from a quite smooth surface for GP to a highly roughened surface for MEGP, as shown in Fig. 1b. GP shows a bright surface because of the reflection of light on its smooth surface, while MEGP exhibits a dark surface due to the scattering of light on its roughened surface. Finally, the MEGP current collector was delimited with adhesive tape to expose 10 mm × 10 mm of conductive area to load electroactive materials. The as-prepared current collectors were rinsed successively with acetone and deionized water prior to use.

The second step for electrode preparation is electro-codeposition. Before electrodeposition, MWCNTs are subjected to acid treatment to obtain carboxyl-functionalized MWCNTs (MWCNT-COOH). The pristine MWCNTs were first treated with 3 M HNO3 at 140 °C via refluxing with magnetic stirring for 3 days to remove metal catalysts used during preparation. After that, a mixture of concentrated HNO3 and H2SO4 with a volume ratio of 1:3 was employed to treat the MWCNTs through ultra-sonication for 2 h. The obtained MWCNT-COOH was rinsed with adequate deionized water, filtered, and dried at 50 °C.
The electro-codeposition of MWCNT@PPy hybrid films was conducted in a standard 3-electrode configuration, in which the MEGP current collector, saturated calomel electrode (SCE), and Pt sheet serve as working, reference, and auxiliary electrodes, respectively. The aqueous solution for electrodeposition consisted of 1 mg mL−1 MWCNT-COOH, 0.3 M pyrrole, and 0.01 M sodium polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) as the supporting electrolyte. A constant current density of 2 mA cm−2 was applied for 1000 s to obtain the MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes. As illustrated in Fig. 1c, during electro-codeposition, the MEGP current collector acted as the anode, on which pyrrole monomers were oxidized to form a conjugation chain with positive charges. In the meantime, MWCNT-COOH with negative charges served as counter anions/dopant to neutralize the PPy chains for charge balancing. Here, highly dispersed MWCNT-COOH in the aqueous deposition solution acted as a template to induce the growth of PPy coatings, consequently forming a core–shell MWCNT@PPy hybrid on the MEGP current collector. For comparison, GP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes were also fabricated, using the GP current collectors by the same procedure. Likewise, the deposition solution composed of 0.01 M PSS and 0.3 M pyrrole was employed to prepare GP/PPy electrodes. To remove unreacted substances, all the resulting electrodes were rinsed with deionized water after deposition.
Characterization
The composition of samples was examined by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy using a FTIR spectrometer (Tensor 27, Bruker). Their structural properties were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as recorded with an X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV, Rigaku). The surface morphological features were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-6701F, JEOL). Raman spectra were acquired through a Thermo Fisher DXR Raman microscope with a laser source of 633 nm. XPS spectra were recorded on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The core–shell microstructure of the MWCNT@PPy hybrid was characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (Tecnai G2 F20, FEI).
All the electrochemical characterization studies were carried out using a Chenhua CHI 660E electrochemical workstation under ambient conditions. The electrochemical properties of electrodes were measured via a symmetric two-electrode cell in 1 M KCl electrolyte, using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The EIS tests were conducted over a frequency range from 105 to 10−2 Hz, with an AC perturbation of 5 mV versus open circuit potential.
The areal-specific capacitance (Careal, F cm−2) of electrodes was calculated from the CV and GCD curves using eqn (1). (1)where  is the integrated area enclosed by the CV curve, A the active area of the electrodes (cm−2), s the CV scan rate (V s−1), ΔV the window of potential tested (V), I the applied current (A), and Δt the discharge time (s).
Flexible EC assembly and its characterization
The solid-state flexible EC was assembled using two pieces of identical MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes, with PVA-H2SO4 as the solid electrolyte. The PVA-H2SO4 electrolyte was fabricated by adding PVA (1 g) into 1 M H2SO4 (10 mL) and stirred at 90 °C until the solution became clarified. After cooling it at room temperature, two identical MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes with 1 cm2 of working area and a piece of cellulose separator 20 μm in thickness were soaked into the resultant electrolyte for 10 min. Subsequently, the two electrodes were sandwiched together with the separator in between to obtain a flexible all-solid-state EC, after which it was placed in an ambient environment until the electrolyte solidified. The electrochemical properties of the assembled EC were measured using a two-electrode system with a Chenhua CHI 660E electrochemical workstation, and the effect of mechanical deformation on electrochemical properties was also evaluated.
Results and discussion

Fig. 2a shows the FTIR spectra of MWCNTs, MWCNT-COOH, PPy, and MWCNT@PPy. Compared to the FTIR spectrum of MWCNTs, that of MWCNT-COOH presents an added peak at 1716 cm−1, resulting from the CO bond in carboxylic groups.38 This observation suggests that acid treatment successfully introduces –COOH onto MWCNTs. The characteristic peaks observed for PPy are attributed to the CC bond (1540 cm−1), C–C bond (1451 cm−1), C–H in-plane stretching (1301 cm−1), C–N bond (1152 cm−1), C–H in-plane deformation (1039 cm−1), wagging N–H (890 cm−1), and out-of-plane N–H vibrations (779 cm−1), respectively.39 For MWCNT@PPy, all the characteristic peaks of PPy can be observed, and a weak peak situated at 1707 cm−1 is also observed, which is ascribed to carboxylic groups on MWCNT-COOH. Here the peak originating from CO stretching on MWCNT-COOH red shifts from 1716 cm−1 for MWCNT-COOH to 1707 cm−1 for MWCNT@PPy, attributed to the strong electrostatic interaction for PPy and MWCNT-COOH.

Fig. 2b shows the XRD patterns of MWCNTs, MWCNT-COOH, PPy, and MWCNT@PPy. The 002 plane (2θ = 26.0°) and 100 plane (2θ = 42.9°) of the hexagonal graphite structure are observed in both MWCNT and MWCNT-COOH samples, indicating that acid treatment does not destroy the graphite structure of MWCNT. MWCNT@PPy and PPy show the amorphous nature, because both of them have a broad XRD diffraction peak centered at 2θ = 25.0°.40 The undetected diffraction peaks of MWCNTs in the MWCNT@PPy hybrid are probably due to overlap with and weakening by the PPy coatings on MWCNTs.

Fig. 3a–c show the SEM images of GP/PPy, GP/MWCNT@PPy, and MEGP/MWCNT@PPy films, respectively. Herein, the GP/PPy electrode has a compact and dense microstructure, being composed of aggregated PPy grains. This morphology is not favorable for the access of the electrolyte into the interior sites of active materials, thereby causing large “dead volume”. To change the traditional compact morphology for the PPy electrode, MWCNT-COOH is introduced as the template to induce the growth of PPy particles, in which carboxylic groups serve as active sites for the formation of PPy chains. Indeed, the compact morphology for PPy disappears for both GP/MWCNT@PPy and MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes. In contrast, nanotube-shaped morphologies emerge in these hybrid electrodes, owing to the template role of MWCNTs. Furthermore, both of them show three-dimension porous nano-network structures, suggesting that the incorporated MWCNTs remarkably improve the dispersion of PPy particles. The TEM image of MWCNT@PPy in Fig. 3d testifies to the idea that MWCNTs are wrapped by a PPy layer, thus forming a core–shell MWCNT@PPy microstructure as presented in the inset. Interestingly, a closer examination of Fig. 3b and c suggests that the nano-network structure of MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes is more dispersed and homogeneous relative to that of GP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes. The microstructure for the former can further increase the access area of the electrolyte into inner electroactive materials. In other words, the growth of the MWCNT@PPy hybrid is remarkably affected by the current collector being used, and MEGP with a roughened surface results in more dispersed growth of the MWCNT@PPy hybrid.

The electrochemical behaviors of GP/PPy, GP/MWCNT@PPy, and MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes are firstly examined by CV measurements. Fig. 4a–c show the CV responses of three types of electrodes at various scan rates. It is obvious that GP/PPy electrodes have inferior supercapacitive properties compared with GP/MWCNT@PPy, because the CV curves seriously deviate from the rectangle shape as the CV scan rate increases (Fig. 4a). Among all three types of electrodes, the CV curves of MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes show larger response current densities and are obviously closer to the rectangular shape up to the fast scan rate at 100 mV s−1. As presented in Fig. 4d, at all the scan rates, the GP/PPy electrodes deliver the lowest areal capacitance, while the MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes achieve the highest. Moreover, the GP/PPy and MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes have the lowest and highest rate capability as well, respectively. These observations demonstrate that: (i) the electrochemical properties of PPy are significantly improved owing to the incorporation of MWCNTs; (ii) the use of the MEGP current collector obviously promotes the electrochemical capacitive behaviors of MWCNT@PPy hybrid electrodes. The former observation is ascribed to the core–shell 3D porous nano-network structure associated with the incorporation of MWCNTs, in which the PPy shell exposes sufficient active sites for the pseudocapacitive reaction. Also, the highly conductive MWCNT network can efficiently transport charge carriers generated by the pseudo-capacitive reaction on PPy, because these charge carriers can reach the MWCNT core from the PPy shell via the radial direction leading to a minimal distance.

To further ensure the superiority of the MEGP current collector for use in ECs, GCD measurements were conducted to compare the supercapacitive properties of GP/MWCNT@PPy and MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes. Fig. 5a shows the GCD plots as recorded at 1 mA cm−2. Both of them show nearly linear and triangle-shaped profiles, which are indicative of fast faradaic reactions. The MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes have a longer discharge time and lower IR drop than GP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes, resulting from the higher specific capacitance and smaller internal resistance for the former. The internal resistance is an important factor that affects the columbic efficiency and rate capability of ECs. Also, a low IR drop will decrease the energy loss during the process of charge–discharge.41,42Fig. 5b shows the coulombic efficiency as a function of GCD current density. The MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes achieve larger coulombic efficiency at all the current densities. For instance, the coulombic efficiency at 1 mA cm−2 is 96.5% and 94.4%, respectively, for MEGP/MWCNT@PPy and GP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes, suggesting a higher ratio of charge utilization for the former.

Fig. 5c is the plot of Careal against GCD current density. The MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes deliver larger Careal relative to GP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes. The Careal of GP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes is 197.1 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2, whereas that of MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes increases to 217.6 mF cm−2. As listed in Table 1, this Careal is larger than those of recently reported EC electrodes originating from CPs. It can be also observed from Fig. 5c that the Careal of MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes follows the trend of steady decline, as the GCD current density increases. The capacitance retention of GP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes is 67.4% as the current density increases 20 times from 0.5 to 10 mA cm−2, while that of MEGP/MWCNT@PPy rises to 80.3%, indicating that the rate capability of MWCNT@PPy electrodes is observably boosted when using MEGP as the current collector.

The EIS Nyquist plots of GP/MWCNT@PPy and MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes are shown in Fig. 5d. Both of them present a typical capacitive behavior, owing to the vertical trend in low-frequency regions. It is revealed that the MEGP/MWCNT@PPy plot leans more towards the Y-axis with respect to the GP/MWCNT@PPy plot, demonstrating superior capacitive response for the former. The inset in Fig. 5d is the EIS plots in high-frequency regions. No obvious semicircles can be seen for both electrodes, indicative of the rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions within the MWCNT@PPy films. The equivalent series resistance (ESR), the intercept of the EIS plot on the X-axis, critically affects the power density.52 The MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes have a smaller ESR, which is in line with higher rate capability compared to GP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes as shown in Fig. 5c. The EIS data further demonstrate that the MEGP current collector obviously promotes the supercapacitive behaviors of the resultant MWCNT@PPy hybrid electrodes.

Fig. 6a, b, and c show the SEM images of GP, GP after exfoliation by adhesive tape, and MEGP, respectively. In Fig. 6a, GP shows a 2D flat surface, consisting of some tightly stacked graphite sheets. Fig. 6b shows that these tightly stacked graphite sheets are separated slightly upon exfoliation using adhesive tape. After ultrasonication treatment, these graphite sheets are separated thoroughly, as shown in Fig. 6c. The resultant MEGP shows a 3D surface, which is composed of layered, wrinkled graphite sheets. The plausible mechanism to obtain layered MEGP is as follows. Some gaps are generated among the stacked graphitic layers after the GP experiences exfoliation by adhesive tape, which can result in water molecules occupying these gaps. The vibrations of water molecules within graphitic layers upon ultra-sonication cause further separation of these graphite sheets, thereby forming the layered microstructures for MEGP. The layered graphitic structures can lead to an observably enlarged surface area for MEGP with respect to GP.

Furthermore, the XPS spectra of GP and MEGP shown in Fig. 6d have the same atom ratio of O:C, suggesting that no oxygen-containing groups are introduced by the mechanical exfoliation method, which does not involve oxidation processes. Likewise, the Raman spectra of GP and MEGP shown in Fig. 6e present the same intensity ratio of ID/IG, indicating that no structural defects are introduced by mechanical exfoliation. The latter observation ensures a high graphitic structural quality, which maintains a high electrical conductivity with MEGP as the current collector.
The difference in surface topography between GP and MEGP results in a different interface being formed with the MWCNT@PPy films as illustrated schematically in Fig. 6f. The GP/MWCNT@PPy and MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes show 2D and 3D interfaces between electroactive films and current collectors, respectively. In contrast to the 2D interface, the 3D interface represents an observably larger contact area. Consequently, the 3D interface facilitates stronger adsorption between electroactive films and current collectors, according to the surface energy theory.53 A system with a large surface area would attempt to lower the surface tension by strengthening adsorption, thereby decreasing the surface energy. Besides stronger adsorption to MWCNT@PPy films, a larger contact area would result in more contact points, which shorten the distance of charge transport between electroactive films and current collectors. This situation avoids the large constriction and spreading resistance being formed when current passes limited contact points at the interface, on the basis of the contact resistance theory.54 Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3b and c, the MEGP with a roughened surface allows more dispersed and homogeneous growth of the MWCNT@PPy nano-network structure with respect to GP, which contributes to the increased access area of the electrolyte into inner electroactive materials. To sum up, compared to GP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes, the enhanced supercapacitive behaviors for MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes can be ascribed to two factors. One is to establish high-efficiency electrical links at the MEGP/MWCNT@PPy interface. The other is to form a dispersed and homogeneous MWCNT@PPy nano-network structure by using the MEGP substrate.
To explore the potential applications as flexible solid-state energy storage devices, MEGP/MWCNT@PPy EC is fabricated in this work by assembling two pieces of symmetric MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes with the PVA-H2SO4 solid electrolyte. For comparison, GP/MWCNT@PPy EC is also assembled with GP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes by the same procedure. Fig. 7a and b show the CV responses of GP/MWCNT@PPy and MEGP/MWCNT@PPy ECs, respectively. It is obvious that the latter has larger current responses, whose shape is closer to rectangle than the former at various scan rates. This observation indicates superior electrochemical properties for the latter. Fig. 7c shows the GCD profiles of MEGP/MWCNT@PPy EC. They are linear and relatively symmetric, suggesting fast charge transfer kinetics similar to electric double layer capacitors, as well as high coulombic efficiency for the EC.
 Fig. 7  CV curves for (a) GP/MWCNT@PPy and (b) MEGP/MWCNT@PPy ECs scanned from 10 to 100 mV s−1. (c) GCD plots for current density ranging from 1 to 5 mA cm−2 and (d) GCD current density-dependent areal capacitance for the MEGP/MWCNT@PPy EC. The inset in (d) shows its Ragone plot. 

Eqn. (2), (3) and (4) are the formulas for calculating areal capacitance (Careal, F cm−2), areal energy density (W h cm−2), and areal power density (W cm−2) for the EC, respectively. Careal = (I × t)/(A × ΔV)(2) E = (Careal × ΔV2)/2(3) P = E/t(4)where I is the discharge current (A), t the discharge time (s), A the EC area (cm2), and ΔV the potential window tested (V). Fig. 7d shows the variation of Careal of the EC with GCD current density. The device yields a Careal of 101.5 mF cm−2 tested at 0.5 mA cm−2, compared to those delivered by reported CP based ECs in recent years (see Table 1). Rate capability is a key index that reflects the rapid charge/discharge ability of ECs. It can be seen from Fig. 7d that the plot presents a smooth declining trend and the device achieves a Careal of 76.8 mF cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2. Namely, it retains 76.8% of the initial capacitance as the current density increases 20 times, testifying high rate performance. Likewise, as shown in the inset of Fig. 7d, the Ragone plot of the device follows a smooth declining trend, in line with the high rate capability. This device achieves 8.9 μW h cm−2 energy density at 0.26 mW cm−2 power density, and maintains 6.3 μW h cm−2 at 4.61 mW cm−2. Namely, it retains 70.8% of the initial energy density as the power density increases by 18 times.
For flexible electronics applications, the ECs as power sources need to endure various deformations without severely affecting their electrochemical properties.62 The inset in Fig. 8a shows that the EC device can maintain structural integrity at deformation states, including bent and twisted states, which demonstrates rather high flexibility against different mechanical deformations. Fig. 8a and b illustrate the effect of various deformations on the electrochemical properties of the EC by CV and GCD measurements, respectively. Remarkably, almost overlapped CV responses and GCD profiles are observed under different deformation states, ensuring the feasibility of the device for use under various deformation environments.
 Fig. 8  (a) CV profiles at 50 mV s−1 and (b) GCD responses at 2 mA cm−2, tested at various deformation states for the MEGP/MWCNT@PPy EC. The inset in (a) shows digital photographs of the EC under those deformation states. (c) Variation of capacitance retention with cycle number/deformation times for the EC. The inset in (c) is a digital photograph, demonstrating that two EC units in series can drive a motor fan. 
The lifespan of flexible ECs is closely related to their mechanical deformation stability and electrochemical stability in practical use. In this work, the mechanical deformation stability of MEGP/MWCNT@PPy EC has been assessed via repeated deformation tests, in which one deformation includes one bent state at 180° and one twisted state. Fig. 8c shows the device retains 95.1% of the initial capacitance even though it endures deformation 400 times, testifying to its excellent mechanical stability. This can be attributed to its mechanical robustness and suitable interfacial contact for different components of the EC. To simulate the practical use, continuous GCD cycles at 2 mA cm−2 are used to assess the electrochemical stability of the device under various deformation states. Fig. 8c shows that the device achieves 87.1% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles, suggesting superior cycle performance. Ultimately, a motor fan is driven by two EC units connected in series, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8c. The electrochemical and flexible features presented by MEGP/MWCNT@PPy EC demonstrate its great practical applicability in flexible and wearable electronics.
Conclusions
This work demonstrates the fabrication of mechanically exfoliated graphite paper (MEGP) using an easy and scalable mechanical exfoliation method. The MEGP is subsequently utilized as a current collector to load core–shell MWCNT@PPy hybrids as electroactive materials for the construction of electrochemical capacitors (ECs), via electro-codeposition. The MEGP features a unique layered microstructure without destroying its graphitic crystal structure. It is shown that the incorporation of MWCNTs significantly improves the electrochemical properties of PPy electrodes, due to the MWCNT@PPy core–shell microstructure being formed in the hybrids. The MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes show distinctly enhanced supercapacitive performances relative to GP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes, because of the 3D interface constructed between MEGP and MWCNT@PPy in the former, as well as the more dispersed and homogeneous MWCNT@PPy nano-network grown on MEGP. The flexible solid-state EC assembled using MEGP/MWCNT@PPy electrodes shows superior electrochemical properties and high flexibility. It yields an areal capacitance of 101.5 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2, and retains 76.8% of the initial capacitance when the GCD current density increases 20 times. After 10000 cycles, it has a capacitance retention of 87.1%. The EC device also retains 95.1% of the initial capacitance after enduring harsh mechanical deformation for 400 times. This study suggests the great potential of MEGP for commercialization in high performance flexible ECs, which are of low cost and suitable for large-scale preparation. The constructed MEGP/MWCNT@PPy EC with superior electrochemical properties and high flexibility holds great promise for applications in flexible electronics.
