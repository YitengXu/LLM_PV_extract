    , Accepted 7th November 2020First published on 9th November 2020AbstractThis review focused on the surfactant-assisted synthesis of metal phosphate-based materials and summarized their potential based on the design of a mesoporous structure as well as the composition and crystal structure of the inorganic frameworks. In the cases of Ti and Zr, metal phosphate frameworks are constructed through two synthetic pathways. One is a step-by-step process including phosphation of the as-synthesized metal oxides. The phosphation process is helpful for stabilizing the mesoporous structures constructed by thin inorganic frameworks. Direct synthesis is possible when the thickness of frameworks is enough for stabilizing mesoporous structures prepared using polymeric surfactants like EOnPOmEOn type triblock copolymers. Other mesoporous metal (e.g., Nb, Ta, Cr, Ga, Sn) phosphates are directly obtained using CnTMA type surfactants. In addition, unique mesostructural alterations are observed for some metal (e.g., Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ca as redox/ionic) phosphates. According to the nature of the metal oxide like units and surface properties of metal phosphate frameworks, the resultant mesoporous materials are broadly investigated as newly designed catalysts and/or catalyst supports for selective oxidation, acidity-dependent, photo-induced, and electrochemical reactions. For enrichment of electrochemical activities, crystallized frameworks with a suitable P/M ratio are required for fabricating electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells, fuel cells and lithium-ion batteries. Consequently, the contents of this review provide an opportunity for designing mesostructures of a wide variety of metal phosphates containing earth-abundant metals.
1. Introduction
Esters of phosphate (OP(OR1)n(OH)3−n), phosphonate (OP(OR1)2−n(OH)nR2), and phosphinate (OP(OR1)R2R3) can be ligated to a wide variety of metals (B, Mg, Al, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Sr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Cd, In, Ba, Hf, Ta, W, etc.).1 According to the reactivity of such compounds with a phosphorus (P) center, an extensive variety of metal phosphate-based frameworks have been manufactured so far with the formation of open-framework structures at the nanometer scale.1 Considering the resultant dimensionality of metal phosphate-based frameworks, metal species are surrounded by oxygen (O) atoms of phosphate through covalent bonds and distinguished as isolated (single-atom like) and networked (molecularly ordered) metal oxide species. Examples of titanium oxide units with different arrangements in some titanium phosphates are displayed in Fig. 1. Isolated (monomers) and connected (dimers, trimers, and chains) titanium species are found as octahedral (TiO6) units in the crystallized frameworks, which are obtained by changing the pH value of precursor solutions.2 From this viewpoint, a family of metal phosphates and related materials is worth studying for proposing a rational and/or feasible methodology to design cutting-edge functional materials with periodically arranged metal oxide units.

The mesostructural design of metal phosphates has been increasingly in demand for improving their functions. Highly porous materials, including ordered mesoporous ones, are available for making many interfaces by complexing with other components than common particulate ones. Ordered mesoporous silica compounds (FSM-16, MCM-41, MCM-48, etc.) were initially fabricated with the self-assembly of alkyltrimethylammonium (CnTMA) type surfactants,3–8 and this finding has provided us with exciting opportunities to synthesize an extensive variety of mesostructured and mesoporous inorganic solids with the self-assembly of cationic, nonionic, and anionic amphiphilic organic molecules as the soft-templating approach.9–15 The framework composition of ordered mesoporous materials has also been diversified from silica, including organosilica (PMO; periodic mesoporous organosilica), to a variety of metal oxides and designed further to metal phosphates, including metal phosphonates, through improvement of the soft-templating approach with the evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) process.16–21 As illustrated in Fig. 2 for the formation of a mesostructured metal phosphate, soluble inorganic species initially interacted with the hydrophilic part of amphiphilic organic molecules and condensed gradually in a precursor solution. Consequently, the amphiphilic molecules are concentrated and organized into an ordered mesoporous structure with the formation of metal phosphate frameworks.

A few reviews focusing on the design of aluminophosphate (AlPO) based materials using amphiphilic organic molecules have been published22,23 and further challenges have also been well-documented for hybridization of metal phosphate-based frameworks by using diphosphonic acids bridged by organic groups.24–28 Towards outstanding development of this synthetic method, the reactivity of the bisphosphonate compounds to a metal source (e.g., AlCl3) is carefully assessed through a partial acidification of the bisphosphonate ester and then several organic linkers like molecularly designable aromatic compounds can be successfully embedded in AlPO like frameworks.29,30 Here, I mainly review mesostructured and mesoporous metal phosphates, excluding aluminum ones, prepared using amphiphilic organic molecules, which are useful for mastering synthetic approaches and characterization techniques. A variety of catalytic and electrochemical applications arising from metal phosphate-based frameworks were also introduced to understand their potential. Although many review articles on the surfactant-assisted synthesis of silica, alumina, titania, carbon, etc. have been published,9–11,31–35 only a short summary was found in a review focusing on recent findings of several kinds of metal phosphates and phosphonates with open-framework structures.36 In this context, this review is only accessible for comprehensive understanding of the mesostructural design of metal phosphate-based materials.
2. Surfactant-assisted mesostructural design of metal phosphates
Examples of the synthesis of metal phosphates with periodic mesoporous structures are summarized in Fig. 3 by using the periodic table indicating counter metal species. A number of metal phosphate-based materials have been synthesized with the formation of surfactant-assisted mesopores. This summary reveals that a variety of earth-abundant metals are mainly utilized for fabricating mesoporous metal phosphate-based materials. Earth-abundant metals are especially very useful as unique catalysts by designing local environments and electronic structures of the metal centers.37 From this viewpoint, metal phosphate-based frameworks constructed with periodically arranged metal oxide units with phosphate (PO4) spacers would also be interesting. This is a significant aspect for considering the uniqueness and significance of metal phosphate-based materials with mesostructural design.

2.1. Titanium (Ti) and zirconium (Zr) phosphates
A liquid-crystal templating (LCT) mechanism using a non-ionic surfactant such as poly(oxyethylene) alkyl ether (e.g., C12EO5) was applied for obtaining mesoporous titanium phosphate.38 Although another synthesis process was conducted by using neutral alkyl amines (CnNH2),39,40 periodicity of the surfactant-assisted mesopores was improved by using cationic CnTMA type surfactants,41–43 which was proved by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the case using C16TMABr with 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (1,3,5-TMB), a two-dimensional (2-d) hexagonal structure prepared under acidic conditions can be maintained by applying step-by-step calcination up to 450 °C.44 The resultant porosities are summarized in Table 1. In addition, lamellar and 2-d hexagonal mesostructured titanium fluorophosphates were obtained using CnNH2 and CnTMA type surfactants, respectively.45,46 The mesoporous structure was still maintained even after semi-crystallization of the frameworks through thermal treatment under nitrogen (N2). Different periodicities including cubic Pmn were also designed using Gemini type (CnH2n+1N(CH3)2C3H6N(CH3)3, n = 14, 16, 18, abbreviated as C14-3-1, C16-3-1, and C18-3-1) surfactants.47 In a special case, lamellar like metal phosphate sheets were rolled into multiwalled nanotubes in the presence of trioctylamine ((C8H17)3N).48 As in the case of the synthesis of ordered mesoporous metal oxides including silica,13,49,50 poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (EOnPOmEOn) type triblock copolymers, such as Pluronic P123 (EO20PO70EO20) and F127 (EO106PO70EO106), are very useful as amphiphilic organic molecules for the mesostructural design of titanium phosphates.19

The first approach for the synthesis of zirconium phosphate like frameworks was reported to involve combining the surfactant-assisted synthesis with post-treatment using anionic phosphate species for improving the thermal stability of the resultant ordered mesoporous structures.51,52 In an aqueous solution, zirconium sulfate (Zr(SO4)2·4H2O) was changed to polymeric ZrOx(SO4)2−x species that can interact with cationic headgroups of C16TMABr. Zirconium propoxide (Zr(OC3H7)4) was also utilized as a zirconium source. However, the resultant 2-d hexagonal structure collapsed during calcination at 500 °C. Accordingly, the mesoporous structure was stabilized by treating with an aqueous solution of H3PO4. The main peak was absolutely maintained even after calcination at 500 °C for 6 h. During the post-treatment, sulfate anions were exchanged with phosphate species and Zr–OH groups reacted with the phosphate species in zirconia-based frameworks for an enhancement of the thermal stability of the ordered mesoporous structure through further crosslinking.53,54 As illustrated in Fig. 4, a mesoporous structure can be stabilized by phosphation of zirconia frameworks, which can also be applied for the synthesis of mesoporous titanium phosphate like materials as described previously. In addition, direct fabrication of thicker frameworks, which can be achieved by using EOnPOmEOn, is quite useful for stabilizing the mesoporous structure.

According to this approach, ordered mesopores were designed in the range from 4.3 nm (for C16TMABr) to 5.5 nm (for C22TMABr) and the BET surface area was 540 m2 g−1 (for C20TMABr) at the largest.52 A cubic Iad symmetry can be fabricated using N-benzyl-N,N-dimethylalkylammonium chloride hydrate.55 In addition, different cubic Pmn symmetries were fabricated using tri-headgroup quaternary ammonium surfactants (e.g., C18H37N(CH3)2C2H4N(CH3)2C3H6N(CH3)2N(CH3)3, C18-2-3-1) and changed into a 2-d hexagonal (p6mm) one by synthesis using a larger headgroup (e.g., C18-3-4-1).56 As shown in the representative TEM images Fig. 5, similar mesostructural design was also achieved by using Gemini type surfactants (e.g., C16-3-2 and C18-3-2 for cubic Fmm, C14-3-1 for 3-d hexagonal P63/mmc, C18-3-1 for cubic Pmn, C18-3-18 for cubic Iad and C16TMABr for 2-d hexagonal p6mm).57 Depending on the surface curvature of the surfactant-assisted mesoporous structures, the thermal stability of the mesoporous zirconium oxophosphates was increased with the surface curvature and thus spherical mesopores were more stable than tubular ones (Iad < p6mm < Fmm, P63/mmc, Pmn).

Self-adjusted synthesis by considering the acidity and basicity of starting chemicals has been proposed and a variety of ordered mesoporous metal phosphates were mainly obtained using EOnPOmEOn.19 For example, ordered mesoporous zirconium phosphates with p6mm and Imm symmetries were obtained with the EISA process in the presence of Pluronic P123 and F108 (EO132PO50EO132), respectively. The average values of the specific surface area, pore volume and pore size were around 200 m2 g−1, 0.25 cm3 g−1 and 5 nm after calcination, respectively. Through the reaction between Zr(OiC3H7)4 and triethyl phosphate (OP(OC2H5)3) under acidic conditions with post-treatment with a vapor of H3PO4 after spin-coating, a 2-d hexagonal mesoporous zirconium phosphate film was also fabricated using Pluronic P123.58 Similar zirconium oxophosphate powders were also recovered through the EISA process with the self-assembly of Pluronic F127 after the reaction between ZrOCl2 and trimethyl phosphate (OP(OCH3)3).59 As in the case of the first step-by-step approach with the post-treatment of ordered mesoporous zirconia with H3PO4, the textural properties of mesoporous zirconium oxophosphate were improved by the addition of OP(OCH3)3. The specific surface area, pore volume and pore size were, respectively, 160 m2 g−1, 0.26 cm3 g−1 and 5.6 nm after calcination at 500 °C and the mesoporous structure was thermally stable at 800 °C.
2.2. Vanadium (V), niobium (Nb) and tantalum (Ta) phosphates
A mixed-valence (V4+/V5+) oxovanadium phosphate (VOPO4) was synthesized at pH = 1.2 from vanadium oxide (V2O5) and H3PO4 using C16TMABr with the formation of a 2-d hexagonal mesostructure.60 The mesostructured material was converted to oxidative (VO)2P2O7 and reductive β-VOPO4 without retention of the mesoporous structure after thermal treatment at 700 °C. Electrochemical deposition of VOPO4 was also reported using C16TMACl and the basal spacing of the main peak was about 4 nm.61 In addition, lamellar VOPO4 was recovered from sodium metavanadate (NaVO3) and sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4) through drying of the acidic precursor solution containing C12NH2.62 In addition, lamellar vanadium phosphate was synthesized from V2O5 and H3PO4 in the presence of C16NH2.63 Different approaches were also reported for obtaining lamellar oxovanadium phosphate.64–66 Once a layered VOHPO4·0.5H2O is synthesized, the VOHPO4 layers can be organized as a lamellar mesophase through the self-assembly of C18NH2 molecules after exfoliation of VOHPO4·0.5H2O in a mixed solvent of dimethylformamide (DMF) and H2O.64 Similarly, layered VOPO4·2H2O was utilized as a host material for obtaining lamellar type VOPO4 through intercalation of alkyl amine (CnH2n+1NH2, n = 8–18, also abbreviated as CnNH2) molecules.65 Layered VOPO4·2H2O can be exfoliated in 2-propanol (CH3(CH3)CHOH, iPrOH) and organized into a lamellar phase with self-assembly of C16TMABr.66 Anionic vanadium borophosphate (V2P2BO12) clusters were also arranged in lamellar phases with CnNH2 (n = 7–18).67
Mesoporous niobium phosphates with Iad and p6mm symmetries were prepared from the precursor solutions using C16NH2 (NbCl5:H3PO4:C16NH2 molar ratio = 10:28:6) and C16TMABr (NbCl5:H3PO4:C16TMABr = 10:300:5), respectively.68 The XRD patterns of the latter showed the presence of typical peaks (d100 = 4.0 nm) before calcination though a broad peak at a d-spacing of 3.7 nm was observed at low diffraction angles after calcination at 450 °C for 6 h. The BET surface area and the pore volume were about 480 m2 g−1 and 0.35 cm3 g−1, respectively, with an average pore diameter of 1.7 nm that was controlled down to 1.3 nm by changing the alkyl chain length to C6NH2 and C10NH2.69 Anionic surfactants such as SDS did not seem to be suitable for obtaining ordered mesoporous structures.70 In addition, another mesoporous niobium phosphate can be synthesized from niobium(III) tartrate (Nb2(C4H4O6)3) and diammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH3)2HPO4) using C16TMABr under acidic conditions.71 The periodicity of the mesostructure was not very high and so the BET surface area (290 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.29 cm3 g−1) were somewhat low. According to the literature,72 these values for mesoporous niobium phosphate prepared using C14TMABr were 430 m2 g−1 and 0.23 cm3 g−1, respectively.
For the synthesis of mesoporous tantalum phosphates using CnTMABr (n = 14, 16), tantalum tartrate was utilized as a starting chemical.73–75 After calcination at 550 °C, the BET surface area and the pore volume were, respectively, 360 m2 g−1 and 0.41 cm3 g−1 at the highest.73 As in the above case of niobium phosphate, the mesostructural design for fabricating the ordered mesoporous structure has not been achieved yet. The pore size distribution curve of that using C14TMABr ranged between 2.3 and 15 nm with a peak at 3.1 nm. The BET surface area, the pore volume and the average pore diameter of another material prepared using C16TMABr followed by calcination at 550 °C were 260 m2 g−1, 0.18 cm3 g−1 and 2.8 nm, respectively.74,75 Even after calcination at 700 °C, the porosity was somewhat maintained (150 m2 g−1 and 0.20 cm3 g−1) but the average pore diameter seemed to be strange (increased to 5.5 nm).
In the most central paper describing the possibility of self-adjusted synthesis by acid–base pairing of starting chemicals using triblock copolymers,19 a significant insight has been explained for obtaining mesoporous niobium phosphates (e.g., Imm using Pluronic F108 and p6mm using Pluronic F123 and F127) as well as vanadium phosphate (p6mm using Pluronic P123). In both cases, thermal stability of the ordered mesoporous structures would be enhanced by increasing the thickness of the metal phosphate frameworks surrounding the mesopores, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Unfortunately, further reports on successful mesostructure design of such mesoporous metal phosphates have not been found any more. Considering the experimental results for the synthesis of highly ordered mesoporous titanium and zirconium phosphates, the mesostructural ordering would be able to be improved using CnTMA type surfactants for obtaining ordered mesoporous vanadium, niobium, and tantalum phosphates.
2.3. Chromium (Cr) and tungsten (W) phosphates
Mesoporous chromium(III) phosphate was synthesized using C14TMABr where the Cr/P ratio was nearly 1.0.76 After extraction of the surfactant molecules with an ethanolic sodium acetate (CH3COONa) solution at room temperature, the BET surface area and pore volume were about 380 m2 g−1 and 0.29 cm3 g−1, respectively. A solid-state reaction for obtaining different mesoporous chromium phosphates (Cr/P = 2.0) was also proposed; CrCl3·6H2O and NaH2PO4·2H2O were ground for 20 min and then mixed with C16TMABr for another 15 min.77 After the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 24 h, the resultant product was washed with distilled water, dried at 100 °C for 24 h, and treated at 450 °C in N2 for removing the surfactant molecules. The BET surface area and pore volume were about 250 m2 g−1 and 0.21 cm3 g−1, respectively.
A 2-d hexagonal mesostructured material consisting of 11-tungstophosphate Keggin anions (PW11O397−) was obtained with the self-assembly of C12TMA cations around pH = 8.0–8.5.78 The resultant frameworks were entirely constructed using anionic species, which may be a reason why the surfactant molecules cannot be removed by calcination with the retention of the mesoporous structure. Accordingly, for obtaining mesoporous tungsten phosphate, a new synthetic approach may have to be developed for fabricating mesostructured precursors with a W/P ratio of 1–2 that has been observed for a wide variety of other metal phosphates.
2.4. Manganese (Mn), iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co) phosphates
Etching of Mn3O4 nanocrystals using n-hexyl phosphonic acid (n-C6H13PO(OH)2) directed the formation of a lamellar manganese phosphate,79 as shown in Fig. 6. The mesostructure collapsed by conventional thermal treatment and extraction with hydrochloric acid because the manganese phosphate sheets were constructed by strong ionocovalent bonding between anionic phosphate like units and cationic manganese species. Interestingly, highly ordered microporous Mn3(PO4)2 can be obtained through annealing at 500 °C (3 °C min−1) under high-vacuum (1 × 10−3 Pa). The BET surface area and pore size were 300 m2 g−1 and 1.4 nm, respectively. The microporous structure was converted to a mesoporous one by high-vacuum-assisted annealing at 550 °C for 3 h. The pore size was increased to 18 nm by crystallization of the frameworks, with a decrease of the BET surface area to about 150 m2 g−1.

A lamellar mesostructured iron phosphate was prepared from ferric acetylacetonate and alkyl ammonium dihydrogen phosphate CnNH3+·H2PO4− (n = 10, 12, 16),80 while a mesoporous one, in a light yellow colour, was obtained by mixing iron(III) nitrate (Fe(NO3)3) and disodium hydrogen phosphate (Na2HPO4) with hydrofluoric acid (HF) in the presence of SDS followed by heating at 60 °C for 2.5 h.81 The SDS molecules were removed by repeatedly washing with H2O and acetone. The BET surface area, pore volume and pore size were 250 m2 g−1, 0.21 cm3 g−1 and 2.6 nm, respectively. Another approach to obtain mesoporous iron phosphate was proposed from phenyl phosphonate (C6H5PO(OH)2).82 The mesoporous iron phosphate (170 m2 g−1, 0.24 cm3 g−1, 3.2 nm) was obtained by calcination of the mesostructured iron phenylphosphate (240 m2 g−1, 0.17 cm3 g−1, 2.1 nm) that was prepared with HF using SDS at 180 °C for 15 h. Mesoporous iron phosphate nanotubes (∼50 nm) were also synthesized by an additional solvothermal treatment in absolute EtOH at 150 °C for 24 h.83 The BET surface area, pore volume and pore size were 230 m2 g−1, 0.25 cm3 g−1 and ∼3 nm, respectively.
A 2-d hexagonal mesostructured iron phosphate was prepared from iron(III) sulfate (Fe2(SO4)3) and H3PO4 using C16TMACl.84 However, only 50% of the surfactant molecules were extracted by simple washing with EtOH, revealing that the surfactant molecules would be attached strongly to the frameworks. Another mesoporous iron phosphate was prepared from iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2·4H2O) and H3PO4 in the presence of C16TMACl.85 In this case, the surfactant molecules were extracted at room temperature by using an ethanolic solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH). The BET surface area, pore volume and pore size were 380 m2 g−1, 0.40 cm3 g−1 and 3.2 nm, respectively.
The 4th generation of amine terminated poly(amido amine) dendrimer was helpful as a single molecule template for obtaining mesoporous iron phosphate.86 EOnPOmEOn type triblock copolymers were useful for fabricating mesoporous iron phosphates;19,87 a lamellar one was prepared using Pluronic P123 and less ordered mesoporous ones were obtained using Pluronic F127. In the latter case, the morphology of the resultant particles was controlled by changing the solvent (EtOH for plates and tetrahydrofuran (THF) for rods).87 Polymeric micelle templating was very powerful for obtaining highly porous iron phosphate.88 For example, an asymmetric polystyrene-b-poly-2-vinylpyridine-b-ethylene oxide (PS-PVP-PEO) triblock copolymer was utilized for designing large-sized mesopores (30 nm) surrounded by thick frameworks (15 nm).
A lamellar cobalt phosphate was prepared from cobalt nitrate (Co(NH3)2·6H2O) and NaH2PO4 using oleylamine (cis-9-octadecenylamine) with 1-decane.89 Nanoplates of amorphous (Co3(PO4)2) were assembled as nanosheets with self-assembly of oleylamine and then split into nanowires. As shown in Fig. 7, a 2-d hexagonal mesostructured material of crystallized Co3(PO4)2 was prepared using C16TMABr, which can be extracted by using an ethanolic solution containing hydrochloric acid (HCl) with retention of the mesoporous structure, with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH).90 The BET surface area and pore volume were 210 m2 g−1 and 0.18 cm3 g−1, respectively.

2.5. Nickel (Ni) phosphate
Nanotubes of nickel phosphate were synthesized from nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) and H3PO4 in the presence of C16TMABr, which can be extracted by using an ethanolic solution of sodium acetate (CH3COONa) at room temperature, with the addition of aqueous solutions of ammonia (NH3) and TMAOH.91 As illustrated in Fig. 8, the nanotubes were organized into some layers and packed more closely in a lamellar like symmetry. The mesoporous structures were thermally stable up to 400 °C. The BET surface area and pore volume of the layered type mesoporous nickel phosphate (extracted) were about 290 m2 g−1 and 0.36 cm3 g−1, respectively. Those of the lamellar type assembly of nickel phosphate nanotubes were about 210 m2 g−1 and 0.20 cm3 g−1, respectively. In addition, both of the mesoporous materials showed bimodal pore size distributions (2.7 nm and 3.7 nm for the layered type and 2.0 nm and 3.9 nm for the lamellar type).

2.6. Gallium (Ga) phosphate
The synthesis of mesoporous gallium phosphates was, for example, investigated starting from gallium(III) propoxide (Ga(OC3H7)3) and phosphorus chloride (PCl3) in a non-aqueous system (e.g., THF/n-propanol, pH = 6–7) with amphiphilic organic molecules such as C16TMABr and hexadecyl pyridinium chloride (C16PyCl), followed by calcination at 550 °C.92 The BET surface area, pore volume and pore size of mesoporous gallium phosphate prepared using C16TMABr were 215 m2 g−1, 0.32 cm3 g−1 and 3.9 nm, respectively. Those of another mesoporous gallium phosphate prepared using C16PyCl were 200 m2 g−1, 0.22 cm3 g−1 and 3.7 nm, respectively.
2.7. Tin (Sn) phosphate
A mesoporous tin(IV) phosphate was synthesized from tin chloride (SnCl4) and H3PO4 in the presence of CnTMABr (n = 8, 12, 16, 18) with TMAOH.93 Ordered mesoporous tin phosphates with 2-d hexagonal (p6mm) and cubic (Pmn) symmetries were synthesized from tin tetrafluoride (TiF4) and H3PO4 in the presence of CnTMABr (n = 14, 16).94 After calcination at 400 °C for 8 h, the 2-d hexagonal (C16TMABr) and cubic (C14TMABr) mesoporous structures were maintained and the BET surface areas observed for these were 350 m2 g−1 and 425 m2 g−1, respectively. The pore sizes were estimated to be in the range from 1.5 nm to 2.0 nm. In addition, tin phosphate frameworks of the as-synthesized material prepared using C16TMABr can be crystallized as SnHPO4 and converted to Sn2P2O7 by annealing at 400 °C for 8 h.95 In the case of tin phosphate, large-sized mesopores can also be designed using EOnPOmEOn type triblock copolymers, such as Pluronic P123 and F127.96 A 2-d hexagonal mesoporous tin phosphate was prepared from SnCl4 and H3PO4 in the presence of Pluronic F127.97 The framework structure, monoclinic (C2/c) Sn(HPO4)2·H2O, was also crystallized to Sn2P2O7 (space group; Pa) during calcination at 500 °C for 2 h. As in the case explained above for iron phosphate,82 C6H5PO(OH)2 was utilized for obtaining mesoporous tin phosphate using SDS.98 Mesoporous tin phosphate (250 m2 g−1, 0.23 cm3 g−1, 3.2 nm) can be obtained through calcination of a mesostructured tin phenylphosphate (370 m2 g−1, 0.19 cm3 g−1, 1.9 nm) that was prepared from tin chloride (SnCl4·5H2O).
2.8. Calcium (Ca) phosphate
Cationic and anionic surfactants such as poly(oxyethylene) oleyl ether phosphate and C14TMABr were utilized for synthesizing hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) from CaCl2·2H2O and NaH2PO4·H2O.99 After calcination at 400 °C, the BET surface area was 130 m2 g−1, comparable to that obtained without any surfactants (110–120 m2 g−1). A 2-d hexagonal mesostructured calcium phosphate with the crystallinity of monetite (CaHPO4) can be obtained using C16TMABr though the thermal stability has not been discussed yet.100 In addition, a lamellar like porous calcium phosphate was also synthesized from CaCl2 and C6H5PO(OH)2 in the presence of SDS.101 The BET surface area and pore volume (calcined at 400 °C) were 72 m2 g−1 and 0.57 cm3 g−1, respectively.
Solubility controlled synthesis of lamellar calcium phosphate was proposed using CnNH2 (n = 16),102 which was applied for the synthesis of a lamellar magnesium (Mg) phosphate.103 The synthesis of wormhole-like calcium phosphate was also achieved using 4-dodecyldiethylenetiriamine, thereby affording a mesoporous calcium phosphate with a BET surface area of 140 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 0.47 cm3 g−1 after calcination at 400 °C.104,105 As in the case of the formation of a lamellar calcium phosphate using carboxylic acid type surfactants,104 amorphous calcium phosphates with different P/Ca ratios (1.05 and 0.52) can be obtained in the presence of common amino acids without alkyl chains.106 Only the P-rich one can be converted to a wormhole-like mesoporous material by calcination at 500 °C. Considering the alkyl chain length of the surfactant used, the resultant mesopores seemed to be very large (7.1 nm) and were derived by merging a few mesopores, which was supported by clear evidence from careful TEM observations, as summarized in Fig. 9.105

A vesicular type calcium phosphate was prepared from calcium chloride (CaCl2) and Na2HPO4 in the presence of C16NH2 (pH = 5) through electron irradiation107 and a hollow one was obtained using C16TMABr through ultrasonication.108 In addition, calcium phosphate nanofilaments were formed by transformation of a corresponding water-in-cyclohexane emulsion with Pluronic P123 to reversed micelles of calcium bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate.109 By utilizing n-dodecyl phosphate (n-C12H25PO(OH)2) and C16TMABr, micron-sized rods and nanoparticles of calcium phosphate were also synthesized from CaCl2 and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (K2HPO4), respectively.110
Several amphiphilic block copolymers such as Pluronic P123 and F127 have been used for the synthesis of mesoporous calcium phosphates.111–114 Although the BET surface areas of mesoporous calcium phosphates prepared using Pluronic P123 and F127 were larger than 200 m2 g−1,111 the formation of surfactant-assisted mesopores has not been observed by TEM. A successful example approach to prepare a wide variety of mesostructured calcium phosphates including mesoporous ones was reported with the self-assembly of a unique diblock copolymer, poly(isoprene)-b-poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate), which interacted with amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles.114 Some of the TEM images are displayed in Fig. 10, indicating the formation of lamellar, cubic Imm, and 2-d hexagonal (p6mm) mesostructures, and so on.

3. Characterization for understanding metal phosphate frameworks
Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) as well as low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements are useful for identifying the formation of ordered mesoporous structures. Considering the type of N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm, the mesoporous structures can be imaged more clearly. TEM and/or high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) have been utilized for visualizing the mesoporous structures. These analyses are common techniques for understanding the resultant mesoporous structures.4,7,115–124 Complete removal of surfactant molecules accommodated in ordered mesopores can be confirmed by using thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) with considerable mass loss arising from thermal combustion of the organic moieties. As shown in Fig. 11, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis is useful for checking the removal of surfactant molecules with the disappearance of main signals due to the presence of alkyl chains. The presence and absence of organic molecules can be identified more clearly by solid-state 13C CP/MAS NMR (magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance).

Chemisorption analyses, such as temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) and FT-IR measurements after pyridine adsorption, have been frequently utilized to evaluate the surface properties of materials. As typical chemisorption data, diffuse reflectance FT-IR (DRIFT) spectra are also displayed in Fig. 11, with the corresponding NH3-TPD profile and estimated acidity.125 The DRIFT spectra of a mesoporous zirconium phosphate showed strong bands at 1634 cm−1 and 1541 cm−1, indicating the presence of Brønsted (B) acid sites and an additional band at 1450 cm−1 due to pyridine molecules attached to Lewis (L) acid sites. The ratio of B-/L- acid sites can be calculated by elevating the temperature during the DRIFT measurements. In addition, its total acidity and strength of the acid sites were evaluated by NH3-TPD. When elevating the temperature, NH3 molecules started to be desorbed above 200 °C and the amount was maximized at around 430 °C with a hump at around 330 °C, indicating the presence of a significant number of strong acid sites. Finally, it was evidently found that total acidity was gradually changed with variation of the amount of the B-/L- acid sites according to the synthetic conditions such as the P/Zr molar ratio.
In the case of metal phosphate based mesoporous materials, further analytical data such as chemical data (ICP and EDX for composition), crystallographic data (XRD for the crystal structure and crystallinity), spectroscopic analysis data (e.g., FT-IR and solid-state 31P MAS NMR) for the chemical state of frameworks, ultraviolet-visible absorption data (UV-Vis), electron spin resonance data (ESR), Mössbauer data for the chemical state of metal species, etc. have always been required for complete understanding of the chemical state in metal phosphate frameworks. Solid-state 31P MAS NMR data, including those observed for AlPO based frameworks surrounding surfactant-assisted mesopores,126–129 are summarized in Table 2 and are quite helpful for proving the successful networking of metal phosphate-based frameworks.

A variety of spectroscopic analyses were also available for understanding the chemical state of metal species; for example, those observed for mesoporous iron phosphates are displayed in Fig. 12.134 Crystallinity of iron phosphate frameworks can be distinguished by comparing the binding energy of Fe 2p (from tetrahedral to octahedral species) and P 2p (hydration degree of phosphate). In the as-synthesized material, the IR bands observed at 2851 and 2924 cm−1 can be assigned to C–H stretching vibration and thus FT-IR measurements are helpful for checking whether surfactant molecules are extracted from the mesoporous structure or not. The absorbance at ∼1000 cm−1 is related to the presence of PO43− units. In the far-IR region, the absorbance bands at 320, ∼270, and 225 cm−1 are related to the presence of tetrahedral Fe3+, octahedral Fe3+, and octahedral Fe2+ species, respectively. The Raman spectra exhibited two intense bands at 1031 and 996 cm−1 with weak bands at 1182 cm−1 and those in the range of 400–700 cm−1 being assignable to the stretching and bending vibrations of PO4 units. Depending on the crystallinity of the iron phosphate frameworks, the absorbance for the charge transfer was moved to a longer wavelength in the UV-Vis spectrum.

Mössbauer spectroscopy of 57Fe is also useful for collecting relevant information on metal sites.85 The room-temperature spectrum exhibited discrimination between FeO6 (>0.3 mm s−1) and FeO4 (<0.3 mm s−1) environments with the isomer shift (IS) value. The temperature-dependent magnetic properties of a 2-d hexagonal mesostructured vanadium phosphate containing C16TMABr were investigated for understanding the bond topology and short-range order of vanadium phosphate (P/V = 1/1) frameworks with VIV/VV = ca. 0.49, 1.17 and 1.56.60 All the frameworks showed typical VO2+ ESR spectra and very similar magnetic behavior with a regular variation of the curve shape with the VIV content. Ferromagnetic type interaction was dominant at high temperature and antiferromagnetic interaction between the VIV centers was observed in the low temperature region. The unique surface properties of a wormhole-like mesoporous calcium phosphate (P/Ca = 1.05) can be confirmed by measuring the adsorption–desorption isotherms of water and cyclohexane.105 The calcium phosphate surfaces were extremely hydrophilic, which has not been observed for surfactant templated mesoporous materials. The mechanical properties of calcium phosphate nanostructures were measured by nanoindentation,114 revealing an order of the magnitude stronger than unstructured composites with similar compositions will be suitable for dental repair and hard tissue engineering.
4. Emerging applications of mesostructured and mesoporous metal phosphates
The mesostructural designs of metal phosphate-based materials are categorized in the periodic table of elements (see Fig. 3), which gives us some significant insights concerning the structure/composition of metal phosphate frameworks. Thus, in this section, their potential applications are briefly introduced by considering the properties of the framework structure (covalent or not) and metal species (redox, ionic, etc.). Even after the advancement in the surfactant-assisted soft-templating approach, it has still been difficult to apply some compositions that are only achieved by the hard-templating (also called replication/nanocasting) approach using ordered mesoporous structures of silica and carbon,135–139 as well as surface modification of mesoporous metal oxide with phosphate and phosphonate species.140–148 Although such a step-by-step process is not suitable for engineering an actual device, those having replicated structures are worth investigating for finding the unique properties arising from non-silica-based frameworks around ordered mesopores. If a new and/or outstanding property is discovered by using such replicated and further designed materials, we would be motivated to develope a direct synthetic method as the soft-templating approach.
4.1. Catalysts for selective oxidation reactions
The oxidation reaction of cyclohexene (c-C6H10) with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) over a C18NH2 templated mesoporous titanium phosphate was compared those observed over titanium substituted MCM-41 type mesoporous silica (Ti–MCM-41).40 It is known that titanosilicate (TS-1) is very useful for obtaining the corresponding epoxides selectively. As in the case of TS-1, 2-d hexagonal mesoporous silica containing isolated Ti4+ species in the silicate frameworks (Si/Ti = 23, 46, 93) was applied to a liquid-phase (methanol, MeOH) reaction of c-C6H10 (33 mmol) with H2O2 (10 mmol) at 60 °C for 3 h.149 Being different from that observed for TS-1, the selectivity to cyclohexene oxide was hardly observed for Ti–MCM-41 type materials and conversion of c-C6H10 was not so high. In the case of using mesoporous titanium phosphate, the typical oxidation reactions are summarized in Fig. 13. Almost all c-C6H10 was converted to the corresponding 1-ol and diol.40 Similar results (c-C6H10:H2O2 = 1:1) were reported at 60 °C for 8 h; 76% of c-C6H10 was converted to 1-ol (88% selectivity) and diol (12% selectivity) over a mesoporous titanium phosphate prepared using C18TMABr, revealing the presence of tetrahedral titanium (Ti4+) species.43 Several papers showed a similar tendency where substrates bulkier than c-C6H10 were epoxidized with high selectively.42,150 By using mesoporous titanium phosphate with V2O5, o-xylene was oxidized by O2 to o-tolualdehyde, phthalic anhydride, and phthalide.42 After incorporation of silicon (Si) atoms into the frameworks, completely selective (100%) benzylation of symmetric substrates, such as p-xylene and 1,3,5-TMB, with benzyl chloride was observed at 70 °C.151
 Fig. 13  Oxidation reactions which have been investigated by using a wide variety of mesoporous metal phosphates. 
A series of transition metal (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) doped mesoporous zirconium oxophosphates showed excellent properties in the liquid-phase oxidation of ethylbenzene.152 A liquid-phase Friedel–Crafts benzylation was investigated with the loading of molybdenum oxide (MoO3).153 A variety of corresponding reactions were carried out after the loading of ammonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, equivalent to 10 wt% MoO3) followed by thermal treatment at 700 °C. Esterification of levulinic acid with 1-butanol was carried out with the formation of n- and pseudo-butyl levulinate. In addition, phenylglyoxal was also 82% converted to ethyl mandelate with 92% selectivity over similar mesoporous zirconium oxophosphate.154
Oxidation reactions of 1-naphthol and phenol with H2O2 were also investigated by using a mesoporous niobium phosphate (P/Nb = 1.38).68,69 Selective hydroxylation of 1-naphthol was observed at the para position of the aromatic ring. Although conversion of phenol was almost the same (13–15%) in solvents such as acetonitrile (CH3CN) and MeOH, the selectivity was quite different (catechol/hydroquinone = 1.8 in CH3CN and 21.2 in MeOH). Oxidation of benzyl alcohol and 1-phenylethanol with H2O2 was also confirmed at 90 °C with enough selectivity (∼100%) to benzaldehyde and acetophenone, respectively.70 Epoxidation of styrene over the same Si containing mesoporous tin phosphate was conducted in the presence of H2O2,155 leading to an adequate conversion (88%, 80 °C, 36 h) of styrene with relatively high selectivity (86%) to styrene oxide in CH3CN. Hydroxylation of phenol with H2O2 was conducted in glacial acetic acid by using similar mesoporous iron phosphate.134 The frameworks contained tetrahedral Fe3+ and octahedral Fe2+/Fe3+ species and thus showed better catalytic performance and unique distribution of products such as hydroquinone and catechol.
Nanotube type iron phosphate (P/Fe = 3/2) was also helpful for promoting hydroxylation of phenol.83 A nanotubular mesoporous nickel phosphate prepared using C16TMABr was useful for selective oxidation of bulky cycloalkenes like cyclododecene with 99% selectivity of the epoxide.91 By changing the substrate into a small one like c-C6H10, the selectivity was drastically decreased down to 40% though the conversion was increased nearly up to 90% under the same reaction conditions (e.g., 60 °C, 6 h). Asymmetric epoxidation of α-methylstyrene and indene was investigated by using a layered crystalline calcium phosphate, with an integral ethylene unit arising from styrene and the pendant benzene unit, containing mesopores.156 The molecular structure was very useful for immobilizing the chiral Mn(III) salen complex, successfully promoting excellent epoxidation reactions of unfunctionalized olefins. Aerobic oxidation of alkylaromatics such as toluene was also promoted over mesoporous gallium phosphate (P/Ga = 1/1), leading to the formation of benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde as the major and minor products.92
4.2. Catalysts for acidity-dependent reactions
The representative and important dehydration and hydrolysis reactions are summarized in Fig. 14 and are catalyzed by acidity. Dehydration of isopropanol (i-PrOH) was investigated by using a mesoporous chromium phosphate prepared in the presence of C16TMABr through a solid-state reaction at low temperature (80 °C).77 Compared to nonporous and another mesoporous chromium phosphates through a liquid-phase sol–gel reaction, a solid-state derivative mesoporous chromium phosphate (P/Cr = 2.0) showed significant activity (93%) with selectivity to propene (96%). For example, those observed for the sol–gel derivative chromium phosphate were less than 70% and 95%, respectively. Esterification of alcohols with CH3COOH and long-chain fatty acids with MeOH was also possible over a mesoporous zirconium phosphate (P/Zr = 1.0 and 2.0) prepared using Pluronic F127.157 Mesoporous titanium phosphates with different P/Ti ratios less than 1.0 were investigated for acetalization of glycerol with acetone.158 Mesoporous titania was less active in this reaction and its conversion was maximized in the range from 0.75 (3/4) to 1.00 (4/4) of the P/Ti ratio. A SDS templated mesoporous iron phosphate (P/Fe = 1/1) exhibited significant properties for the synthesis of nopol (2-(6,6-dimethyl-2-bicyclo[3.1.1]hept-2-enyl)ethanol) through Prins condensation of β-pinene and paraformaldehyde (CH2O)n.159 The reaction in CH3CN was completed by using 1.0 g of the catalyst at 80 °C for 4 h.
 Fig. 14  Dehydration and hydrolysis reactions which have been investigated by using a wide variety of mesoporous metal phosphates. 
Surface acidity of a mesoporous zirconium phosphate (P/Zr = 1.93) prepared using C16TMABr can be utilized for liquid-phase hydrolysis of ethyl acetate (CH3COOC2H5 + H2O → CH3COOH + C2H5OH).160 The conversion of CH3COOC2H5 was linearly increased and then it reached about 10% at 70 °C for 1 h, being almost equivalent to 30 mL of 0.5 M HCl. Friedel–Crafts and Pechmann condensation reactions including its microwave-assisted synthesis were conducted by utilizing the surface acidity.161–163 A series of lactones and esters were also obtained from the corresponding ketones through Baeyer–Villiger oxidation reactions at room temperature.164 Some reactions between carbonyl compounds, such as ketones and aldehydes, and ethylene glycol were well achieved at 120 °C and the catalytic properties were well documented where the P/Zr ratio was 0.75. The Brønsted acid was improved with the loading of tungsten oxide (WO3) and accelerated a Friedel–Crafts benzylation between anisole and benzyl alcohol with a selectivity higher than 80% at 170 °C.165 A wormhole-like mesoporous titanium phosphate (200 m2 g−1, 0.26 cm3 g−1, 4.8 nm) prepared using Pluronic P123 was more active for catalytic hydrolysis of CCl2F2 in the presence of water vapor and air (CCl2F2 + 2H2O → CO2 +2HF + 2HCl) than titanium phosphate particles (120 m2 g−1, 0.40 cm3 g−1, 7.5 nm).166 The catalytic activity was related to the surface acidity of the frameworks and the presence of hydroxyl (–OH) groups, being almost comparable to a mesoporous AlPO based material having acidic surfaces.
The surface acidity of niobium phosphate frameworks was also useful for dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF).72 The maximum yield of 5-HMF reached was up to 45% at 130 °C for 30 min, which can be attributed to the high density of the acid sites and tolerance to water. A mesoporous tantalum phosphate can catalyze transesterification of edible sunflower oil with MeOH at 200 °C even in the presence of 5% H2O without leaching tantalum and phosphorus species.74 Selective dehydration of glucose to 5-HMF was also possible; the yield of 5-HMF was 33% at 170 °C for 60 min with 56% conversion of glucose.75 A hierarchical mesoporous titanium phosphate containing macropores was helpful for a microwave-assisted conversion of biomass (e.g., fructose, sucrose, glucose, and cellulose) to 5-HMF.167 The mesoporous zirconium oxophosphate was also useful for dehydration of fructose to 5-HMF under mild reaction conditions (120–140 °C, without microwaves).168 Tin phosphate with Pluronic P123 templated large-sized mesopores (ca. 10 nm) showed excellent activity for catalytic conversion of fructose, glucose, sucrose, cellobiose, and cellulose to 5-HMF in a water/methyl isobutyl ketone biphasic solvent.96 The maximum yields of 5-HMF were 77, 50, 51, 39, and 32 mol% under microwave-assisted heating at 150 °C, respectively.
Mesoporous tin(IV) phosphates with 2-d hexagonal and cubic Pmn symmetries were applied for selective reduction of NO (1000 ppm) with ethylene (C2H4, 1000 ppm) in the presence of excess O2 (20000 ppm, lean conditions) in balanced He at 50 cm3 min−1.94 The surface acidity of the tin phosphate frameworks was important and significant conversion of NO to N2 was observed at temperatures ranging from 400 °C to 600 °C. The conversion was maximized at around 475 °C and the selectivity to N2 was very high with the formation of by-products like 10–15 ppm of NO2 and 40–50 ppm of N2O.
4.3. Adsorbents/catalysts for biocompatible reactions
High-surface-area (above 200 m2 g−1) calcium phosphate particles, which can be obtained from mesostructured ones prepared using Pluronic P123 and F127 followed by their extraction, showed significant properties for the adsorption of proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme.111 The derivative mesoporous structures were very helpful for storing the protein molecules that can be released for several days at 37 °C under conditions with pH 7.4 (phosphate buffer).
Hollow calcium phosphate with an average diameter of 145 nm and hydroxyapatite like shell (about 45 nm thickness) nanospheres captured a high amount of amylose and released the molecules only under ultrasonication.108 The release kinetics can be controlled by changing the power of ultrasonication ranging from 50 W to 150 W, which is interesting for achieving a smart drug release system. Hollow hydroxyapatite like nanospheres (particle size; 30 nm, diameter of the void space; 20 nm) prepared by micelle templating of asymmetric triblock copolymers such as polystyrene-b-poly(acrylic acid)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) (PS-PAA-PEG) with an anionic block were biocompatible.169 A MTT (3-(4,5-di-methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) bioassay test of a breast cancer cell line (BT-20) proved that the cell viability was as high as that without the nanoparticles, demonstrating excellent biocompatibility in vitro.
A variety of hazardous metal ions (e.g., AsIII/V, CdII, and HgII) and radionuclides (e.g., 239PuIV, 236NpV) was adsorbed over titanium phosphate based mesoporous materials.152,170 Mesoporous tin phosphate (P/Sn = ca. 1/1) with different Si contents was utilized for investigating the anion-exchange and catalytic properties.155 The anion-exchange capacity was increased up to 2.56 mmol g−1 for Cl− (ca. 520 m2 g−1) with a decrease in the Si content and was helpful for removing arsenic (∼200 ppb of AsIII) from polluted ground water. Almost 90% of the AsIII anions can be removed at room temperature in the presence of H2O2, though the efficiency was decreased down to 45% without H2O2.
4.4. Catalysts for photo- and electro-induced reactions
A tin oxide (SnO2) coupled mesoporous titanium phosphate was investigated for improving the photodegradation property of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) on the basis of effective radical (mainly ˙O2−) trapping through electron transfer from the mesoporous metal phosphate to the SnO2 nanoparticles, being superior to that observed for a TiO2 (Degussa P25) coupled one.171 The photo-induced properties of zirconium/titanium phosphate were interesting for the production of hydrogen (H2).172,173 After loading Pt (1 wt%), the mesoporous materials (e.g., Zr/Ti = 1/1) showed considerable activity in the water splitting reaction under irradiation with UV-Vis light by using a 300 W Xe lamp.172 When cadmium sulfate (CdS) particles were incorporated into similar mesoporous zirconium/titanium (e.g., Zr/Ti = 1/3) phosphate, H2 was effectively produced under visible light.173 The quantum yield at 420 nm reached up to 27.2%.
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated by applying microporous and mesoporous manganese phosphates (P/Mn = 2/3) in 1 M KOH as an electrocatalyst.79 Although nonporous Mn3(PO4)2·3H2O sheets have shown higher catalytic performance, the overpotential is still serious (higher than 700 mV) due to their low surface area. From this viewpoint, highly porous manganese phosphate is quite promising; the overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 were calculated to be 332 mV (for the microporous one) and 367 mV (for the mesoporous one). The electrochemically active surface areas of the microporous (1.4 nm, 300 m2 g−1) and mesoporous (18 nm, 150 m2 g−1) manganese phosphates were also evaluated to be 189 cm2 and 130.5 cm2, by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) for measuring the double-layer capacitance with a general specific capacitance of 0.040 mF cm−2, respectively. These excellent insights would be considered a new horizon for developing electrocatalysts applying transition metal compounds.
The electrochemical properties of amorphous Co3(PO4)2 nanowires were investigated by CV and gravimetric charge–discharge (GCD) with an aqueous KOH electrolyte (3 M), as shown in Fig. 15.89 The nanowires showing high specific surface area for the highly surface-dependent faradaic redox reactions were very promising in supercapacitors. In the as-synthesized nanowire electrodes, the redox peaks can be clearly observed even at a higher scan rate up to 80 mV s−1. All the GCD measurements of the nanowires at different current densities displayed symmetric triangular charge/discharge curves with good cycling stability up to 4000 cycles, indicating their pseudocapacitive properties. The corresponding specific capacitances were evaluated (see the values in the figure) and were found to be much higher than those observed for crystalline cobalt phosphates, indicating good cycling stability. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor device was also fabricated by using the nanowires as the positive electrode and active carbon (AC) as the negative electrode. The specific capacitances of the nanowires and the AC electrode were 1174 F g−1 and 178.25 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1, respectively. A combination of both pseudocapacitive and electric double-layer type of capacitance was observed at all scan rates and the nonlinearity of the GCD curves particularly was confirmed at lower current densities. In this context, it is considered that the amorphous Co3(PO4)2 nanowire electrode is extraordinary for energy storage.

By using a 2-d hexagonal mesoporous cobalt phosphate (P/Co = 2/3, 210 m2 g−1) prepared using C16TMABr, its electrochemical properties were investigated in 1 M KOH.90 Oxidation of water was greatly enhanced by the presence of the large amount of accessible active surfaces, which will be quite promising for water splitting devices and renewable energy systems. Electrochemical oxidation of MeOH was investigated by using a nanotubular mesoporous nickel phosphate (theoretically P/Ni = 2/3, 210 m2 g−1) prepared using C16TMABr.174 Incorporation of Si was very useful for stabilizing the electrochemical environment and improving the electrochemical activity. Because the electron-transfer resistance was reduced remarkably from 16 kΩ to 3 kΩ, a faster electron-transfer process was possible for the oxidation of MeOH. Nanoflake like 2-d hexagonal mesoporous tin phosphate was fabricated using Pluronic F127 for improving its electrochemical properties in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).175 The electrochemical performance was increased by changing the inorganic component from SnO2 to tin phosphate even when the materials were nonporous, which was due to the presence of surfactant-assisted mesopores, and improved further by mixing graphene oxide (GO).
4.5. Electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cells, fuel cells and lithium-ion batteries
Mesoporous titanium phosphate could be utilized as an overlayer for the photoanode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) of titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2, 18 nm, 18-NRT Dyesol), though the titanium phosphate itself was not available for the electrode.176 Intercalation of lithium (Li) ions into crystalline titanium pyrophosphate (TiP2O7) frameworks was possible and the charge/discharge properties were improved by the presence of surfactant-assisted mesopores.177 Considering another significant insight concerning the high proton conductivity of 0.02 S cm−1 (80% RH, 25 °C) of a mesoporous zirconium phosphate film,58 such a mesoporous zirconium phosphate was mixed with Nafion for designing a proton-exchange composite membrane fuel cell.178 The composite membrane was evaluated in a H2/O2 polymer electrolyte fuel cell with relative humidity (RH) in the range of 18 to 100%. The porous filler was very helpful for improving the hydrophilicity of the composite membrane with an enhancement of the proton conductivity. A sulfonated mesoporous iron phosphate (P/Fe = 1/2) containing acid sites (–SO3H) was useful as a proton conductive material that actually showed 1.0 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 100% RH, almost comparable to that observed for Nafion 117.82 A proton conductivity of 1.0 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 90% RH was also confirmed after sulfonation of SDS templated mesoporous tin phosphate with pendant phenyl groups (1.19 mmol acid sites per gram).98 These sulfonated mesoporous materials have potential for developing supports as the cathode and anode materials in fuel-cell technology.
Mesoporous Li2Fe2(PO4)3 (180 m2 g−1, 0.18 cm3 g−1, 3.2 nm) can be synthesized using C16TMACl.179 Although the frameworks contained a certain amount of Fe2O3 and FePO4, the discharge behavior of the first cycle at a current density of 20 mA g−1 was higher than that observed for previous cases and reached up to 107 mA h g−1, even at a relatively higher current density of 200 mA g−1. Other mesoporous metal phosphates such as FePO4, Mn3(PO4)2, and Co3(PO4)2 were also investigated in non-polar solvents.180 In particular, mesoporous FePO4 nanoflakes were suitable as the cathode for a lithium-ion battery (LIB) showing enough stability and high rate compatibility.
A 2-d hexagonal mesoporous tin phosphate was utilized as an anode in LIBs after mixing crystalline Sn2P2O7.95 The crystalline Sn2P2O7 anode showed a large initial irreversible capacity (389 mA h g−1) and poor retention properties (from 704 to 146 mA h g−1) after 30 cycles. After mixing the mesoporous tin phosphate with the crystalline Sn2P2O7, the initial charge capacity and initial irreversible capacity were 721 mA h g−1 and 297 mA h g−1, respectively. The retentive capacity up to 30 cycles was 587 mA h g−1, indicating that mesoporous tin phosphate played a significant role in retaining the capacity. The discharge and charge capacities were higher than the theoretical values (834 mA h g−1 and 572 mA h g−1), respectively. The cell potential of the composite anode was also investigated during the first discharging/charging. The d-spacing expanded and shrunk with Li alloying/dealloying and thus 3-d mesoporous frameworks would not collapse during discharge/charge. Another 2-d hexagonal mesoporous tin phosphate with nanoflake like morphology was prepared using Pluronic F127 and the crystallized SnP2O7 type frameworks around the mesopores were interesting as an anode showing good reversible specific capacity, good cycling stability, and excellent capacity retention (92%) for LIBs.97
5. Conclusions and outlook
The mesostructural design using amphiphilic organic molecules has been developed so far for obtaining ordered mesoporous silica-based materials and the supramolecular soft-templating approach has given us a wide variety of opportunities and motivations to design new functions of amorphous/crystallized metal phosphate-based frameworks around surfactant-assisted mesopores. Two directions to obtain metal phosphate-based frameworks have been confirmed with the retention of ordered mesoporous structures; supramolecular mediated mesoporous structures can be stabilized by phosphation of ‘thin’ metal oxide-based frameworks (e.g., Ti, Zr, and Sn) and obtained directly through the grow of ‘thick’ metal phosphate-based frameworks (e.g., Al, Ti, and Zr) around surfactant assemblies. Exceptional structural variations were observed for metal phosphate-based materials containing redox and/or ionic metals (e.g., Mn, Fe, Ni, and Ca). As a special case, triethyl phosphate (OP(OEt)3) is suitable as an unreacted spacer that can be removed under ambient conditions even after mesostructured materials are fabricated in the presence of surfactant molecules.196 This is a new concept for obtaining ordered mesoporous metal oxides such as titania after elimination of OP(OEt)3 that plays an important role in suppressing condensation between metal species. Further design has also been achieved by using bisphosphonate compounds containing molecularly designable organic linkers, promising upcoming advancements in new functionalities such as purification of fine chemicals, complete elimination of hazardous metal ions, CO2 capture, H2 evolution, energy storage, and so on.130–133,181–195
Activity and selectivity in some catalytic reactions seem to be altered because metal oxide units are generally distributed in metal phosphate frameworks, but not isolated distinctly like metallosilicates. Thus, careful assessment and/or reasonable prediction of the composition and crystallinity of metal phosphate-based frameworks is very important for considering a potential application. The information on whether ordered mesoporous structures can be fabricated or not in a range of the P/M ratios is also necessary for obtaining the same materials as those after the initial assessment. In addition, the crystallinity of metal phosphate-based frameworks should be identified and then improved for utilizing their functions to the maximum for emerging applications. In this context, recent advances in the methods to design surfactant-assisted mesopores surrounded by thick inorganic frameworks using polymeric surfactants15,19,50 encourage us to achieve complete and/or full crystallization of such thick frameworks for enhancement of the electrochemical properties only after crystallization of the inorganic frameworks.196,197
