    , Accepted 6th April 2017First published on 6th April 2017AbstractOver the last few years, transition metal oxide layers have been proposed as selective contacts both for electrons and holes and successfully applied to silicon solar cells. However, better published results need the use of both a thin and high quality intrinsic amorphous Si layer and TCO (Transparent Conductive Oxide) films. In this work, we explore the use of vanadium suboxide (V2Ox) capped with a thin Ni layer as a hole transport layer trying to avoid both the intrinsic amorphous silicon layer and the TCO contact layer. Obtained figures of merit for Ni/V2Ox/c-Si(n) test samples are saturation current densities of 175 fA cm−2 and specific contact resistance below 115 mΩ cm2 on 40 nm thick V2Ox layers. Finally, the Ni/V2Ox stack is used with an interdigitated back-contacted c-Si(n) solar cell architecture fully fabricated at low temperatures. An open circuit voltage, a short circuit current and a fill factor of 656 mV, 40.7 mA cm−2 and 74.0% are achieved, respectively, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 19.7%. These results confirm the high potential of Ni/V2Ox stacks as hole-selective contacts on crystalline silicon photovoltaics.
Introduction
Crystalline silicon-based (c-Si) solar cells currently dominate the photovoltaic market; it is a mature technology where most research efforts are concentrated on maximizing efficiency and lowering processing costs. The last record1 on photovoltaic conversion efficiency has been achieved by interdigitated back-contacted (IBC) solar cell structures. The IBC solar cell is an old but attractive concept, which avoids shadow losses at the front surface.2 This is accomplished by placing both electron and hole-selective contacts at the rear side of the device. One important advantage of this structure is the simplification of the passivation and antireflection scheme on the front side design, which is fully decoupled from the rear side strategy. So, the rear side can be optimized for an efficient separation/extraction of photogenerated carriers to the corresponding electrode. Although high efficiency is routinely achieved on lab and industrial IBC cells, room for improvement exists by lowering processing temperatures and/or substituting toxic and flammable dopant gas precursors. In this way, research on dopant-free solar cells, where carrier selectivity3 is achieved using alternative semiconductor materials, is an emerging research topic,4 including organic polymers,5 alkaline salts6 and transition metal oxides (TMOs).7
Transition metal oxides are wide band gap (Egap > 3 eV) semiconductors with a large range of work functions (3–7 eV) exhibiting n or p-type conductivity, offering a broad variety of optoelectronic properties.8 The best known TMOs include molybdenum oxide MoOx as the hole transport layer (HTL) and titanium oxide TiOx as the electron transport layer (ETL), both frequently used in organic electronic devices.8,9 They are deposited by low-temperature and/or vacuum-free techniques, including solution-based processes. Their work function and conductivity are highly tuneable based on their oxygen content, which not only offers flexibility but also makes them highly sensitive to redox environments and surface chemistry.10 For solar cells based on c-Si absorbers, high work function (>5 eV) TMOs such as molybdenum oxide MoOx, tungsten oxide WOx and vanadium oxide V2Ox can perform as efficient HTL films by promoting either an inversion layer on c-Si(n) or an accumulation layer on c-Si(p).11,12

Table 1 lists the latest results using high work function TMOs as HTLs on c-Si solar cells. The preferred method for TMO-HTL film deposition is thermal evaporation, with MoOx being the most reported material. Power conversion efficiencies of 18.8%,13 19.4% (ref. 14) and up to 22.5% (ref. 15) have been achieved on c-Si(n) devices, while an efficiency of 20.4% was reported for c-Si(p).16 Additionally, V2Ox and WOx films are emerging alternatives yielding promising cell efficiencies of 18.3% (ref. 17) and 17.9%,17 respectively, on n-type substrates. These results were achieved using a vertical solar cell structure with both surfaces contacted (conventional solar cells). Regarding IBC structures, several groups have recently reported conversion efficiencies of 15.4% (MoOx),18 16.6% (V2Ox)19 and 12.4% (WOx)19 for c-Si(n) substrates. Generally speaking, the best results are achieved using a very thin intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon, a-Si:H(I), passivation interlayer, which increases the complexity of the final devices,20,21 while only moderate open circuit voltages (Voc ∼ 600 mV) have been reported to date with bare TMO/c-Si heterojunctions. Recently, we demonstrated the surface passivation quality achieved by V2Ox on c-Si(n) obtaining Voc values above 610 mV in a conventional geometry, 20–30 mV more than that using WOx and MoOx layers.12 Also recently, excellent Voc values around 680 mV have been achieved on c-Si(n) substrates.17 Therefore, V2Ox films seem to be a good candidate to form HTL regions on c-Si(n) solar cells.

All the solar cells are fabricated on n-type c-Si except for ref. 16, which is based on p-type c-Si. All a-Si:H films have been deposited by PECVD, whereas V2Ox, MoOx, WOx, LiFx and Cs2CO3 films have been thermally evaporated

In this work, we report on surface passivation and carrier selectivity of thermally evaporated V2Ox films, as well as the impact of the metal capping layer on the electrical contact performance. We demonstrate that Ni/V2Ox/Si heterojunctions provide both a high level of carrier selectivity and low contact resistances on c-Si(n) substrates. Moreover, the long-term stability and temperature stability of the initial electrical properties are also analysed. Finally, this selective contact scheme is applied to an IBC c-Si(n) solar cell architecture, achieving a conversion efficiency of 19.7% on a 9 cm2 device which favourably compares with those reported (see Table 1). It is also remarkable that a highly stable open circuit voltage of 656 mV could be achieved in the final devices without an additional passivation layer, i.e. a-Si:H(I).
Results and discussion
Surface passivation can be characterized in terms of interface recombination velocity (S) or alternatively by means of recombination current density (J0). The former parameter is more suitable for passivation dielectric layers, whereas the latter is applied to selective contacts such as homo and heterojunctions. Independent of the type of surface, recombination can be evaluated by the so-called implied open circuit voltage parameter, iVoc;22 the higher the iVoc value, the lower the recombination inside the device considering both bulk and surface recombination. All foregoing parameters can be obtained by effective lifetime (τeff) measurements using the quasi-steady-state photoconductance (QSS-PC) technique.22
The recombination current density of V2Ox films (J0HTL) was measured for different layer thicknesses (15, 30 and 60 nm) using asymmetrical samples (see the inset of Fig. 1d). In these samples, the front and rear sides were covered, respectively, with a V2Ox layer and a dielectric passivating stack. In order to discriminate the recombination contribution of the selective contact in lifetime measurements, a well-passivated rear surface is necessary, i.e. a low rear surface recombination velocity (SR). Layers like aluminium oxide Al2O3 deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD)23,24 or amorphous silicon carbide films a-SiCx(n)25 deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) meet this passivation requirement. For instance, the surface recombination velocity using ALD Al2O3 films can be as low as ∼0.5 cm s−1, which corresponds to τeff values > 15 ms (at Δn = 1015 cm−3), as seen in the inset of Fig. 1a. Consequently, the J0HTL parameter can be calculated as follows: (1)where W is the thickness of the wafer (280 μm), q is the elementary charge, ni is the silicon intrinsic carrier concentration (ni = 8.56 × 109 cm−3 at 25 °C), Δn is the carrier excess density and τin is the intrinsic bulk lifetime (Auger and radiative mechanisms).26 Notice that the bulk Shockley–Read–Hall recombination mechanism has not been considered since high quality FZ c-Si is used as the substrate. From eqn (1) we can directly extract J0HTL values for different V2Ox thicknesses considering the slopes of 1/τeff − 1/τinversus Δn curves shown in Fig. 1a. Similar results were obtained independently of V2Ox thickness yielding J0HTL and iVoc values of 175 ± 10 fA cm−2 and 675 ± 5 mV respectively, in accordance with the state-of-the-art related to this material.17 In spite of the initial good J0HTL and iVoc results, surface passivation degrades with time as can be deduced from the strong drop in τeff shown in Fig. 1b. This might be due to a reduction of the material work function by chemical reaction of the samples with air (water and oxygen species),27,28 weakening the induced p-type inversion region beneath the contacts and increasing local recombination, i.e. lower τeff values.
 Fig. 1  (a) Measured intrinsic-corrected inverse effective lifetime (symbols) and their fitting (dashed line) as a function of the injection level for different V2Ox thicknesses. Measured τeff (symbols) and τin (dashed line) for a symmetrical ALD Al2O3 passivated sample are shown in the inset. (b) Measured τeff of the 40 nm thick V2Ox layer after its deposition and after three days under air exposure. (c) Comparative behaviour (time-dependence of iVoc under air exposure) of samples with and without nickel capping. (d) Effect of the accumulative annealing temperature on the iVoc value. A sketch of passivated samples used in the study is shown in the inset. Notice that in (c and d) the iVoc values are normalized to their initial values. 
In order to mimic a final contacted solar cell, we explore the use of a nickel metal layer, which has a metal work function (φM) of ∼5.4 eV, as the capping material in a similar way to that reported in ref. 11 where palladium (φM ∼ 5.6 eV) was used over MoOx films. In order to allow reliable QSS-PC measurements Ni thickness is kept under 10 nm (in our case ∼5 nm thick). This is mandatory to guarantee that the metal conductivity does not saturate the lifetime measurement system and sufficient light is transmitted into the silicon substrate. Fig. 1c shows the normalized iVoc to the initial value (iVocn) as a function of time when a thin nickel layer is deposited over 40 nm thick V2Ox films. Samples with the metal capping exhibit much better long-term surface passivation stability, pointing out that the Ni layer is thick enough to block the reaction of chemical species in air with the V2Ox films. In addition, Fig. 1d shows the evolution of the iVocn parameter for accumulative 10 min annealings in forming gas at different temperatures. The Ni/V2Ox films seem to be stable at temperatures, from a surface passivation point of view, up to 300 °C without apparent degradation. These results demonstrate great passivation stability and sufficient thermal budget for the last stages of solar cell fabrication.
To evaluate the electron-blocking and hole-extraction properties, as well as the contact resistance of the V2Ox layers on c-Si(n) substrates, vertical test diodes were used (fabrication details are provided in the Experimental section and the test device sketch is depicted in the inset of Fig. 2b). On the one hand, the measured dark current density vs. voltage (J–V) curves greatly depend on the metal capping material, nickel or alternatively aluminium, the former being the best choice to contact our devices. The J–V curves are enclosed in the ESI (Fig. S1†). We presume that a high φM value plays a significant role in preserving the high work function of V2Ox films, which increases the hole-selective contact behaviour. On the other hand, the influence of V2Ox thickness on the electrical device performance was studied (see Fig. 2a). As it can be seen, the diode ideality factor n = J/(VT × ΔJ/ΔV) (calculated in the middle voltage range and considering a thermal voltage (VT) of 25.69 mV at 25 °C) improves towards the ideal value, i.e. n = 1, as film thickness increases exhibiting a minimum value of ∼1.2 for the 40 nm thick V2Ox sample. Additionally, the specific series resistance (rs) decreases to 115 mΩ cm2 as the V2Ox film thickness increases, producing similar results for 40 and 60 nm. Notice that rs is estimated at forward voltages ∼1 V by fitting the real J–V characteristics and the ideal one without series resistance.
 Fig. 2  (a) Measured dark J–V characteristics for different V2Ox thicknesses (symbols) and their fitting (dashed line) on c-Si(n) diode test devices. The inside table shows extracted parameters from the test diodes. The rs and Voc,ex were extracted at 1 V forward voltage and 40 mA cm−2 current density, respectively. (b) Effect of accumulative annealing temperature on the J–V characteristics. A sketch of test diodes used in the study is shown in the inset. 
If the contribution of the rear contacts to the total series resistance is neglected, rs values are representative of the specific contact resistance between silicon and the Ni/V2Ox stack as a worst case. Additionally, the expected open circuit voltage (Voc,ex), extracted from ideal J–V curves without series resistance at a current density of 40 mA cm−2, seems to be limited to 655 ± 5 mV for relatively thick layers (>30 nm). These values are 20 mV lower than iVoc values obtained from lifetime measurements. This drop might be due to recombination at the rear laser-doped contacts. Finally, an accumulative temperature annealing was done using these test diodes to find the temperature limits of annealing steps after metallization. Fig. 2b shows a rapid degradation with temperatures higher than 150 °C, affecting current transport at high injection voltage levels, i.e. increasing contact resistance.
In order to determine the origin of the good passivation and selective contact, a physical characterization of the V2Ox/c-Si(n) heterojunction was carried out. Firstly, an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) scan was performed on a 10 nm thick V2Ox film deposited on a c-Si(n) substrate. Fig. 3a shows the spectra of the vanadium (V 2p) and the oxygen (O 1s) core levels, with both V5+ and V4+ oxidation states present at their characteristic binding energies,12 confirming that the V2Ox film is oxygen deficient and semiconductive in nature. Secondly, a cross-sectional image of the V2Ox/c-Si(n) interface was obtained via high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), observing the presence of a ∼3.5 nm thick amorphous interlayer between the c-Si and the V2Ox film, Fig. 3b. The formation of such layers has been previously reported for dielectric oxides deposited on c-Si and it has been attributed to the growth of a SiOx interlayer by chemical reaction.29,30 We presume that this SiOx interlayer passivates the c-Si surface dangling-bonds, giving rise to the passivating properties of V2Ox/c-Si heterojunctions. The XPS spectra of the Si 2p core level (see the ESI, Fig. S2†) reveal the presence of Si3+ oxidation states related to silicon suboxide SiOx with an oxygen content x ∼ 1.5.31 This would explain why this interfacial layer, amorphous in nature and rich in defect states, is able to conduct even for thicknesses greater than the tunnelling limit (<2 nm) of fully stoichiometric SiO2 layers.32,33 A similar conduction process is assumed for oxygen deficient metal oxides,8,10 using defect states located within the bandgap as conduction paths for carriers. The valence band spectra measured by XPS (see the ESI, Fig. S3†) in the vicinity of the Fermi level (0 eV) show a characteristic peak at ∼2 eV (after subtraction of the H-terminated c-Si component), which is ascribed to the characteristic defect states reported in the literature.10 Consequently, the continuity of carrier conduction across the c-Si/SiOx/V2Ox interfaces can be guaranteed.

To complement the above characterization, the combination of HR-TEM and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) enables obtaining compositional information from the Al/Ni/V2Ox contact stack (see the ESI, Fig. S4†) confirming the presence of the thin uniform Ni capping layer in between aluminium and V2Ox films.
To demonstrate the applicability of Ni/V2Ox as a hole contact in IBC solar cells, we fabricated proof-of-concept solar cells (3 × 3 cm2 area) with different HTL coverage values (fHTL), defined as the ratio between all HTL regions and the whole device area. A range of fHTL from 40, 52 to 64% was studied in order to know the influence of cell geometry on series resistance and rear surface passivation and its impact on photovoltaic efficiency. Fig. 4a and b depict the schematic structure of the cell and the main steps involved in the fabrication process (see the Experimental section for details). The fabricated IBC cells combine evaporated V2Ox films as HTL and DopLa34,35 (Doped by Laser) ETL regions. Both HTL and ETL strip-like electrodes are defined following an interdigitated pattern isolated from each other with passivated gap regions. Additionally, the metal electrodes contacting each transport layer can be different and optimized for each selective contact thanks to a two-level metallization strategy developed in our devices. In parallel, ALD Al2O3 films deposited over random pyramids achieve excellent front surface passivation and very low light reflectance.24 It is worth pointing out that our devices are both free of a-Si:H(I) and TCO materials and avoid high temperature processes, i.e. thermal diffusion and/or thermal oxidation, resulting in a very low thermal budget.

(d) J–V curve for the best IBC solar cells. In the inset there is a summary of the IBC solar cell parameters measured under standard test conditions STC (AM1.5G 1 kW m−2 solar spectrum, 25 °C) for the three device topologies with 9 cm2 active area. 
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves corresponding to the 40, 52 and 64% HTL coverage cells are shown in Fig. 4c. EQE values up to 98% in the visible wavelength range confirm the outstanding front surface passivation obtained. The slight influence of fHTL on the EQE curves also points out that rear surface passivation provided by both the ETL contacts and the Al2O3 layer in the gap between collector regions is sufficient to avoid significant electrical shadowing.36 Illuminated current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under standard AM1.5G spectrum (1 kW m−2 and T = 25 °C). The photovoltaic parameters are listed in the inset table of Fig. 4d, which also shows the J–V curve of the best IBC cell efficiency. Conversion efficiencies up to 19.7% were achieved with a short circuit current density (Jsc), an open circuit voltage (Voc) and a fill factor (FF) of 40.7 mA cm−2, 656 mV and 74.0%, respectively. These results demonstrate that c-Si(n) IBC cells with a Ni/V2Ox stack as the hole-selective contact can reach high efficiencies in a simple low-temperature fabrication process. Notice the high efficiency values reported in this work for solar cells combining both IBC solar cell architecture and hole transport layers based on transition metal oxides without the use of either a-Si:H(I) or TCOs.

Test devices

Fabrication and measurements. 
Test samples and IBC solar cells were fabricated using high quality 〈100〉 c-Si(n) float zone (FZ) 4′′ wafers of 280 ± 10 μm thickness and 2 ± 1 Ω cm resistivity. Lifetime test samples were cleaned following a RCA1/2 sequence37 and a diluted HF (1%) dip. Next they were covered with different V2Ox thicknesses (15, 30 and 60 nm) using Al2O3 and a silicon carbide carbon-rich layer (a-SiCx) stack (50 nm/35 nm) on the rear side. Effective lifetime measurements use the QSS-PC technique with the WCT-120 instrument (Sinton Consulting).
The test diodes had an active area of 4 × 4 mm2 patterned on a SiO2 film grown on a c-Si(n) substrate (same as IBC solar cells). V2Ox films were deposited on the front side and covered with an Al/Ni metal stack (150 nm/∼5 nm). Several samples were processed considering different V2Ox thicknesses in the 10–60 nm range. In turn, the laser-doped regions (n++), rear point-like contacts were created by irradiating the a-SiCx(n)/a-SiCx stack using the same laser system and laser power described next when details of the IBC solar cell process will be given. Consequently, the rear side consists of a square matrix arrangement of point-like contacts with a pitch of 600 μm, which corresponds to a contacted fraction area (fETL) of 0.8%. After the laser-step, the rear side was fully covered with aluminium (1 μm). The electrical measurements were performed under a four-contact configuration using an I–V tracer (Keithley 3601B).
The structure of the V2Ox/c-Si heterojunction was studied with an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) scan performed on a 10 nm thick V2Ox film deposited on a c-Si(n) substrate, using a non-monochromatic Al-Kα source (1486.6 eV) at 3 × 10−9 mbar (SPECS, Phoibos 150 detector). High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) using a JEOL 2010F with a field emission source (200 kV) was used to determine the microstructural Al/Ni/V2Ox/c-Si structure. The change in the chemistry was studied by the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) technique using a Gatan PEELS system (GIF) in TEM mode. The Al/Ni/V2Ox/c-Si structure was acquired from cross-section lamellas prepared by the focused ion beam (FIB) lift-out technique using a Zeiss 1560XB system.

IBC solar cells

Fabrication and measurements. 
IBC solar cells of 3 × 3 cm2 active area were fabricated as shown in Fig. 4a following the next sequence: the flow process starts with a front side random pyramid texturing by alkaline etching using a tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) based solution. Next, the wafer was cleaned following a RCA1/2 procedure and a 50 nm thick Al2O3 layer was deposited on both sides by ALD at 200 °C (Savannah S200, Cambridge Nanotech). Trimethylaluminium (TMA) and water were used as the aluminium precursor and oxidant species, respectively. A subsequent 10 min annealing was performed in forming gas (H2/N2) at 400 °C in order to activate the surface passivation provided by the Al2O3 films.23,24 Then, a 35 nm thick silicon carbide carbon-rich layer, a-SiCx (x ∼ 1), was deposited on both sides to protect the underneath films against subsequent chemical processes. The a-SiCx layer was deposited by a plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) process (13.56 MHz, from Electtrorava S.p.A) at a temperature of 300 °C from silane (SiH4) and methane (CH4) precursor gases. In order to define the strip-like dielectric regions where point laser contacts will be performed, the a-SiCx layer was locally removed by dry etching using a tetrafluoromethane (CF4) plasma process. After a second RCA1 cleaning and a HF (1%) dip, a phosphorus-doped amorphous silicon carbide layer, a-SiCx(n), and a-SiCx films were deposited by PECVD (20 nm/35 nm). This stack was used as a phosphorus source during the laser doping stage to create point-like ETL regions (n++), as well as to provide good surface passivation. A lamp-pumped Nd:YAG (StarMark SMP 100II Rofin-Baassel) laser system operating at 1064 nm in the ns regime with 4 kHz pulse repetition frequency and laser power of ∼1 W was used to form n++ regions.38 Contacts were arranged at the middle of each ETL finger region with a pitch of 200 μm. Finally, an aluminium (Al) layer (4 μm thick) was thermally evaporated and the interdigitated electrodes were patterned by the standard photolithography technique and wet Al etching. Once the ETL laser contacts were done, the whole back surface was covered with a structural photosensitive 5 μm thick polyimide layer,39 following a two metallization level strategy as seen in Fig. 4b. In this way, the corresponding bottom and top metal materials, Al and Ni/Al respectively, contact ETL and HTL regions. Moreover, the Ni/V2Ox layers were deposited using a shadow mask, avoiding an additional photolithographic step and simplifying the whole fabrication process. The thick polyimide layer not only avoids any shunting between metal levels but also acts as a protection layer against subsequent dry and wet chemical etchings. After opening a window pad on the HTL regions through the polyimide layer by photolithography, the silicon carbide stack was removed by a CF4 dry-etching process. Once a HF (1%) dip etched the Al2O3 film, a ∼40 nm thick V2Ox film was deposited by thermal evaporation of V2O5 powder (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) at 8 × 10−6 mbar and 0.2 Å s−1. The V2Ox film was covered by a nickel capping layer (∼5 nm) without breaking the vacuum. Finally, a highly conductive Al film (1.5 μm) was evaporated on top of the HTL electrode.
The photovoltaic J–V curves and parameters were measured under standard AM1.5G spectrum (1 kW m−2 and T = 25 °C) using an ORIEL 94021A (Newport) solar simulator. Incident light irradiance was properly calibrated by means of a pyranometer. External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves were measured using a commercial instrument (QEX10, PV measurements) with a white light bias of 0.2 Suns and a beam spot of 2 × 2 cm2 centered within the active device area.

Conclusions
This work has demonstrated a novel dopant free Ni/V2Ox hole-selective contact and its application to an interdigitated back-contacted c-Si(n) solar cell architecture. Compositional XPS measurements of V2Ox layers confirm the oxygen deficiency of this material, which might be the origin of conduction states improving carrier transport through the layer. The V2Ox test structures show saturation current densities J0HTL of 175 fA cm−2 and specific contact resistance about 115 mΩ cm2 for 40 nm thick V2Ox layers. The origin of the good passivation properties, indicated by the relatively low J0HTL and high implied open circuit voltage values (675 mV), is probably due to the presence of a very thin SiOx interlayer confirmed by TEM measurements. The incorporation of a nickel capping layer over V2Ox films avoids surface passivation degradation and guarantees the hole-selective contact behaviour. Cell efficiencies of 19.7% in a 9 cm2 active area are reached with an open circuit voltage of 656 mV, which is a remarkably high value for a Ni/V2Ox/c-Si(n) heterojunction without additional passivation. These results confirm the interest of transition metal oxides as potential HTL and ETL materials for crystalline silicon solar cells fabricated with lower thermal budgets and simplified processes.
