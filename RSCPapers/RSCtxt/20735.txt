    , Accepted 18th June 2013First published on 18th June 2013AbstractHerein, we demonstrated that solar driven glucose oxidation to produce hydrogen has been achieved on a functionalized TiO2 nanowire arrays photoanode without expensive metal catalyst loading. The Ni(OH)2 functionalized the electro-reduced TiO2 NWAs photoanode exhibits a much lower onset potential, substantially higher oxidation current density and good stability for glucose oxidation.
Driven by ever-increasing energy needs and environmental concerns, there have been great research interests in the search for clean and renewable energy.1–5 Hydrogen, a clean and renewable energy, has attracted intensive interest as a promising and sustainable energy supply for replacing petroleum fuels in the future.6–10 Currently hydrogen is mainly produced by the reforming of petroleum and natural gas at high temperature that consumes a huge amount of energy. The key to realize a truly sustainable hydrogen-based energy system is to develop efficient and low-cost approaches for hydrogen production.11–16 One of the most promising strategies is photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen production from biomass-derived oxygenates over semiconductor photoanodes according to the reaction:CxHyOz + (2x − z)H2O → xCO2 + (2x − z + y/2)H2which can be operated at ambient conditions and with high efficiency conversion.12,17,18 Of various biomass-derived oxygenates, glucose has been proposed and examined as an alternative and potential hydrogen feedstock since it is abundant, cheap, renewable and easy to obtain.17–20 Glucose is one of the main products of photosynthesis and widely present in nature. Additionally, it is one of the main wastes in agricultural, foods and pulp industries in the world, which could raise serious environmental pollution when not dealt with well. In recent years, some efforts have been devoted to PEC driven hydrogen production from glucose.17,18,20,21 However, the conversion efficiency is still low and there are still many challenges that need to be overcome for practical application. One of the most important challenges is to design and fabricate the highly-efficient photoanodes for a PEC system.22–27 Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, the investigation of the photoanodes for hydrogen production from glucose is still rarely reported.18,20 Until recently, a WO3-based photoanode coupled with a PV cell has been developed for hydrogen production from glucose and showed good photocatalytic activity.18 Despite this achievement, the realization of low-cost, stable and highly-photocatalytic photoanodes with favourable band-edges that straddle the redox potential of hydrogen is still challenging.
In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of solar-driven hydrogen production from glucose over Ni(OH)2 functionalized electro-reduced TiO2 (denoted as Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2) nanowire arrays (NWAs) for the first time. TiO2 has been extensively investigated as an attractive photoanode for hydrogen evolution due to its high photoactivity, low cost, non-toxicity, good stability and suitable band edge alignment for water splitting. Additionally, TiO2 has the strong oxidative power of the oxidative species produced under UV illumination, such as photo holes and highly reactive free radicals that can oxidize most organic compounds.13,28 However, its large band gap energy and poor electrical conductivity seriously restrict its practical applications as photoanodes. Numerous attempts have been devoted to improve the visible light absorption and some achievements have been made.29–31 On the other hand, it is equally important to fundamentally improve the morphology and electronic structure of TiO2 for effective separation and transportation of photoexcited charge carriers. Our recent works have shown that the carrier density of pristine TiO2 can be increased by several orders of magnitudes by creating oxygen vacancies in hydrogen gas at high temperature.13,32 Here, we take TiO2 as a typical semiconductor and demonstrated that the electronic structure of semiconductors can be substantially reformed and its donor density can be improved by a facile, safe, and cost-effective electroreduced method under negative potential. On the other hand, Ni(OH)2 is well known to be a good oxidation catalyst with high selectivity for glucose due to the strong Ni3+/Ni2+ redox couple.32,33 It is hypothesized that the PEC hydrogen activity from glucose will be greatly enhanced when using these TiO2 NWAs with the improved donor density as photoanode and Ni(OH)2 as a glucose oxidation catalyst. Our results showed that the Ni(OH)2 functionalized R-TiO2 NWAs exhibit substantially higher photocatalytic performance in hydrogen evolution from glucose compared to the pristine R-TiO2 NWAs.
Experimental
Preparation of the electro-reduced TiO2 (R-TiO2) nanowire arrays (NWAs) and TiO2 nanofilms (NFs)
All the reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Deionized water was used in all experiments. TiO2 nanowire arrays were synthesized on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate using a hydrothermal method reported elsewhere.12 Fifteen millilitres of deionized water was mixed with 15 ml HCl (36–38%) and followed by the addition of 0.45 ml titanium tetrabutaoxide under strong stirring at ambient conditions. FTO (F:SnO2, NSG) substrates were cleaned by water, acetone and then water. The FTO substrates were placed at an angle against the wall of the Teflon-liner with the conducting side facing down. The sealed autoclave was heated at 150 °C in an electric oven for 5 h. The nanofilms were synthesised according to Zhu's work.34 In a typical synthesis, 10 ml of HCl was mixed with 10 ml of deionized water, and then 2 ml of titanium tetrabutaoxide was added. Afterwards the solution was ultrasonically stirred for 5 min and diluted to a total volume of 120 ml using deionized water. Then the conical flask was put in a water bath tank at 80 °C for 5 h. After that, the FTO substrate was cooled to room temperature in air and finally annealed in air at 550 °C for 3 h. The electroreduction of TiO2 (denoted as R-TiO2) was obtained by applying at a voltage of −1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 30 min at room temperature in a three-electrode cell with a platinum counter electrode.
Preparation of the Ni(OH)2 functionalized R-TiO2 NWAs
Ni(OH)2 was deposited onto R-TiO2 NWAs by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. In a typical synthesis, TiO2 electrodes were dipped into 0.005 M Ni(NO3)2 solution for 15 s, following by drying with compressed air. Then the electrodes were dipped into 1 M KOH solution for another 15 s and dried with compressed air, too. After three dip-coating cycles, the precipitates were washed with deionized water and ethanol. Finally, all samples were dried at 80 °C for 12 h.
Characterizations
The as-synthesized products were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-6330F), X-ray diffractometry (XRD, D8 ADVANCE), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM2010-HR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALab250). Before the XPS measurement, the R-TiO2 was kept in a nitrogen atmosphere. The optical properties of the products were measured with a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-Vis-NIR, Shimadzu UV-2450). Total organic carbon (TOC) and inorganic carbon (IC) were measured with a total organic carbon analyser (Shimadzu, TOC-VCPH). One millilitre of the solution close to the photoanodes after the 5 h reaction was diluted to 50 ml with deionized water before the analysis. Furthermore, the product of the anode was examined by dropping 0.5 ml anodically produced solution into saturated Ca(OH)2 solution.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) and electrochemical measurements
All the PEC and electrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-electrode cell with a flat quartz window to facilitate illumination of the photoelectrode surface. The working electrode is the TiO2, while a Pt wire electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter and reference electrode, respectively. The illumination source was a 500 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE-300/300UV, Beijing Changtuo) directed at the quartz photoelectrochemical cell. All the electrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation (CHI, Shanghai) at room temperature. The electrolyte is 1 M KOH solution with/without 0.1 M glucose. The light intensity is 100 mW cm−2. Gas generated in the Pt cathode at −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl was collected and detected by gas chromatography (GC) with a thermal conductivity detector.
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 illustrates the mechanism of solar-driven hydrogen production from glucose over the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 NWA photoanode. Photoexcited holes (h+) are produced in R-TiO2 NWs under light illumination and will preferentially oxidize Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH.14,21 The formed NiOOH is a good catalyst for the oxidation of glucose and then will oxidize the glucose to become CO2 and H2O via a series of complicated reactions. On the other hand, photo-generated electrons (e−) move through NWs to the counter electrode (Pt) for the reduction of water. The chemical reactions at the electrodes are proposed as follows:Photoanode: R-TiO2 + hv → R-TiO2* + e− + h+Ni(OH)2 + h+ + OH− → NiOOH + H2ONiOOH + C6H12O6 + OH− → Ni(OH)2 + [HCCOH] + H2ONiOOH + [HCCOH] + OH− → Ni(OH)2 + CO2 + H2OCathode: 2H2O + 2e− → H2 + 2OH−

During this process, vertically-oriented and high-crystalline R-TiO2 NWs grown directly on F-doped SnO2 (FTO) glass substrates provide a high interfacial area for the redox reactions and superior electrical pathways for the transport of electrons, which can effectively suppress the electron–hole recombination and hence improve the PEC performance.25,35–38
The fabrication process of the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 NWAs is presented in Fig. 1a. Vertical TiO2 NWAs were firstly grown on a FTO substrate using a hydrothermal method reported elsewhere.7 To enhance the mechanical stability and conductivity, these as-synthesized TiO2 NWAs were annealed at 550 °C for 1 h in air. Then, these TiO2 NWAs served as a working electrode and were reduced by applying a negative voltage of −1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 30 min in 1 M KOH. R-TiO2 NWAs were obtained after partial electrochemical reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the highly dense and aligned TiO2 NWs of 100–200 nm in diameter were uniformly grown on the FTO substrate, and the morphology of these TiO2 NWs has no change after electrochemical reduction (Fig. S1, ESI†). Finally, to promote glucose oxidation, Ni(OH)2 was deposited on the surface of R-TiO2 NWs by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1c and Fig. S2,† the deposition of Ni(OH)2 did not change the morphology of R-TiO2 NWAs. Additionally, the photo-image also confirms that there is no obvious change in appearance and colour of these different samples (Fig. 1b). X-ray diffraction studies reveal that the TiO2 NWAs have a rutile structure and no phase change is observed after electro-reduction and Ni(OH)2 loading. To further study the microstructure of Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 NWs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were conducted. A typical TEM image collected from a single Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 NW is displayed in Fig. S3b,† which clearly shows the partial surface of the R-TiO2 NW covered by Ni(OH)2. The presence of Ni on the R-TiO2 NWs was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of the NWs (Fig. S3c†). Fig. 1d is the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 NWs, which confirms that the R-TiO2 NW is single crystalline and the Ni(OH)2 is amorphous.

Oxygen vacancies in TiO2 are generally known to be shallow donors, which play a critical role in determining the electronic properties of TiO2.39 To prove the oxygen vacancies could be created by electrochemical reduction, we studied and compared the chemical composition and oxidation state of the TiO2 and R-TiO2 samples by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 2a shows the normalized Ti 2p core level XPS spectra of the TiO2 and R-TiO2 samples. Two broad peaks centred at ∼464.4 and ∼458.8 eV agree well with the characteristic Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 peaks of Ti4+ in both samples.9,40 Compared with the Ti 2p peaks of TiO2, a small negative shift in binding energy is observed in the Ti 2p peaks of the R-TiO2 sample, which indicates that electro-reduction causes a surface bonding change of TiO2. Two extra peaks located at 463.5 and 458.0 eV that correspond to the characteristic peaks of Ti3+ are observed by subtracting the normalized Ti 2p spectra of R-TiO2 from pristine TiO2 samples.9,40 The presence of Ti3+ is due to the electrochemical reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+. This result suggests that oxygen vacancies (Ti3+ sites) were successful created in R-TiO2 NWAs during electro-reduction. Additionally, it should be pointed out that the Ti 2p peaks of R-TiO2 do not change after coating with Ni(OH)2 (Fig. S4a†). The O 1 s core level XPS spectra of the TiO2 and R-TiO2 NWAs are also recorded in Fig. S5.† Significantly, the Ti–OH peak intensity of the R-TiO2 sample is substantially higher than that of the TiO2 sample, indicating a large number of hydroxyl groups are also produced on the TiO2 surface after electro-reduction.

To understand the effect of electro-reduction on the electrical properties of TiO2, electrochemical impedance measurements were conducted on the TiO2 and R-TiO2 samples. Fig. 2b shows the Mott–Schottky plots of on TiO2 and R-TiO2 samples, which were generated based on capacitances that were derived from the electrochemical impedance obtained at each potential at 10 kHz frequency. As expected, the R-TiO2 sample exhibits substantially smaller slopes compared to the TiO2 sample, suggesting the increased donor densities (carrier densities) after electro-reduction according to the Mott–Schottky equation:Nd = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1where Nd is the donor density, e0 is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant of rutile TiO2 (ε = 170),41ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, and V the applied bias at the electrode. The Mott–Schottky equation is derived based on planar structure and it may not be able to determine precisely the donor density of nanostructured materials. However, a qualitative comparison of carrier densities between the TiO2 and R-TiO2 samples is reasonable, as they have similar morphology and structure. The calculated carrier densities of the TiO2 and R-TiO2 samples are 8.7 × 1018 cm−3 for TiO2 NWAs and 1.1 × 1021 cm−3 for R-TiO2 NWAs, respectively. Significantly, electro-reduction leads to about 3 orders of magnitude enhancement in carrier density of TiO2 NWAs. This remarkable enhancement in donor density could be attributed to the increased oxygen vacancies in R-TiO2 NWAs.9 More charge carrier density would enhance the electrical conductivity of the photoelectrode, which was highly favourable in improving charge transport and charge separation processes, and thus the improved donor density of the TiO2 NWAs leads to a substantially enhanced PEC performance as our previous expected. As shown in Fig. S6,† the R-TiO2 NWAs yield a photocurrent density of ∼1.4 mA cm−2 at 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is much higher than the pristine TiO2 NWAs (0.63 mA cm−2). This result clearly confirms that the electro-reduction can greatly improve the PEC performance of TiO2 by creating oxygen vacancies as a result of the reduction from Ti4+ to Ti3+.
To illustrate the advantages of our designed electrodes, we studied the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical performances of R-TiO2 and Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 NWAs for glucose oxidation. Fig. 3a compares the cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves of R-TiO2 and Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 NWAs at 10 mV s−1 without/with 0.1 M glucose. Only a small background current without clear redox peaks is observed for R-TiO2 electrode in the absence and presence of glucose, which indicates that neither water oxidation nor glucose oxidation occurs in this potential window. In contrast, the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode exhibits well-defined redox peaks in the potential range between 0.3 and 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M KOH electrolyte. This redox peak is attributed to the Ni2+/Ni3+ transition.32 Additionally, the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode shows a significantly enhanced current at the potential of 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl or above in the presence of glucose, which reveals that glucose was indeed oxidized at this electrode. The electro-oxidation of glucose on the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode was characterized by two well-defined current peaks on the forward and reverse scans. In the forward scan, the oxidation peak corresponds to the oxidation of freshly chemisorbed species that come from glucose adsorption and the consumption of active Ni3+ sites. The reverse scan anodic peak might be associated with removal of carbonaceous species that are not completely oxidized in the forward scan.42 In comparison to the CV curve of the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode in the absence of glucose, the onset potential for glucose oxidation is more negative than the Ni2+/Ni3+ transition potential, indicating that Ni3+ species is a good electrochemical catalyst for glucose oxidation. Additionally, it should be pointed out that glucose oxidation in the presence of Ni(OH)2 is more favourable than water oxidation, because no water oxidation was observed in this potential window.

Inset: photoimage of Pt wire collected at −0.3 V in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution with 0.1 M glucose. 
From Scheme 1, it is expected that the photovoltage generated in R-TiO2 and Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrodes under light irradiation can effectively reduce the need for the external bias for glucose oxidation, and thus can promote the glucose oxidation over these electrodes. To prove this hypothesis, the linear sweep voltammogram (LSW) curves of R-TiO2 and Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrodes under light irradiation were collected in Fig. 3b. As expected, the onset potential for glucose oxidation at the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode shifts to −0.90 V, which is much lower than the onset potential required for glucose electrolysis (0.22 V). Indeed, compared with the R-TiO2 electrode, the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode exhibits a more negative onset potential and higher oxidation current density, indicating that the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode has superior performance for glucose oxidation. As illustrated in Scheme 1, the R-TiO2 NWs produce the photoexcited holes under light illumination and oxidize Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH, which can effectively facilitate the catalytic oxidation of glucose by reducing the electrode potential. Incident-photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) analyses (Fig. S7†) also confirm that Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 exhibited significantly enhanced photoactivity. Additionally, the UV-visible spectra studies show there is no significant change in the light absorption after coating with Ni(OH)2 (Fig. S8†). Therefore, the enhanced glucose oxidation performance at the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode can be mainly due to the extra-bias provided by the photovoltage and decreased overpotential arising from the glucose oxidation promoted by NiOOH. We also evaluated the long term stability of the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode for glucose oxidation under light irradiation. Fig. 3c shows the photocurrent–time response curve of the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode collected at −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Significantly, the photocurrent density for the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode drops less than 5% within the first 20 minutes, and then achieves a stable photocurrent without decay under irradiation for four hours. The slight decrease in photocurrent density in the beginning 20 min could be due to the decrease of the charging current, and the Faradic current keeps stable during the whole measurement. This result indicates that the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 NWAs electrode has sustainable stability for long-term solar driven glucose oxidation. On the other hand, a large number of gas bubbles were observed at the Pt wire electrode under light illumination at −0.3 V (insert in Fig. 3c). To identify the composition of the gas, the gas evolved from Pt electrode was collected and analysed by gas chromatography (GC). The GC result demonstrates that the collected gas at the Pt cathode is hydrogen (Fig. S9†). All these findings sufficiently support the feasibility for solar driven hydrogen production from glucose over the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode. Additionally, to verify the product of glucose oxidation, we used the saturated Ca(OH)2 solution (Fig. S10a†) to exam the product of the anode. Significantly, the clear saturated Ca(OH)2 solution became turbid after dropping in 0.5 ml of the anodically produced solution (for details see Experimental section, Fig. S10b†), indicating the presence of carbonate (CO32− and/or HCO3−). This result reveals that the glucose was oxidized to CO2 during this system. Moreover, the anode products were also collected and analysed by a total organic carbon analyser. From Table S1,† the glucose was decomposed into CO2 under solar light irradiation. Furthermore, the generated CO2 at the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode was nearly double that of the TiO2 electrode, which further confirms the enhanced glucose oxidation performance of Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 electrode. The calculated efficiency of the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 was 79% at −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl after 5 h irradiation, which is substantially higher than that of a WO3-based photoanode coupled with a PV cell (∼57% at a higher applied potential of 0.7 V vs. SCE for 5 h),18 and comparable to Pt-TiO2 film in the PEC cell under anodic bias +0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 20 min (∼75%).43 This work has demonstrated that PEC hydrogen activity from glucose will be greatly enhanced when using these Pt-free TiO2 NWAs as a photoanode and Ni(OH)2 as a glucose oxidation catalyst.
Finally, to demonstrate this present strategy is a general method for improving the performance of TiO2 for solar driven glucose oxidation, we have also performed PEC studies on a TiO2 nanocrystalline film (denoted as TiO2 NF), which is shown in Fig. S11.† TiO2 NF was prepared by Zhu's method (for details see Experimental section). As expected, the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 NF electrode showed a higher oxidation current density compared with the TiO2 NF and R-TiO2 NF electrodes, confirming that this method is an effective and general strategy to enhance the performance of TiO2 for glucose oxidation. Moreover, the photocurrent density of Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 NFs is much lower than that of Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 NWAs, indicating the NWAs are more promising as an electrode for a PEC cell. This is due to the larger surface area and superior transport properties of the NWAs.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the renewable hydrogen production by solar driven reforming of glucose over a functionalized TiO2 NWAs photoanode without expensive metal catalyst loading. Electro-reduction is an effective approach to fundamentally improve the performance of TiO2 NWAs as photoanodes by increased the donor density. Solar driven glucose oxidation to produce hydrogen has been achieved on Ni(OH)2 functionalized on the R-TiO2 NWAs photoanode, with a much lower onset potential and substantially higher oxidation current density than the pristine R-TiO2 NWAs photoanode and TiO2 NWAs electrode for glucose electrolysis. Additionally, the Ni(OH)2/R-TiO2 NWAs electrode exhibited good stability for solar driven glucose oxidation. The capability of solar driven hydrogen released from glucose could open up new opportunities for developing a low-cost, scalable and safe method to produce hydrogen from biomass-derived oxygenates.
