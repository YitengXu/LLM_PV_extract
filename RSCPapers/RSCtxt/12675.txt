    , Accepted 19th September 2018First published on 24th September 2018AbstractIn this study, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are used as a host for Ag species and the template of ZnO to fabricate Ag-embedded porous ZnO nanocomposites (Ag–ZnO NCs) with rich and stable interfaces, which is proven to be a perfect platform for constructing hybrid materials. Remarkably, Ag–ZnO NCs exhibit high catalytic activity for the thermocatalytic decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) under the assistance of ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. The highly enhanced catalytic activity of Ag–ZnO NCs originates from the synergistic effects of thermal-driven thermocatalysis and solar light-driven photocatalysis. Especially, under the irradiation of visible light, the plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PRET) between the plasmonic metal Ag and the neighboring semiconductor ZnO enhances the charge carrier generation efficiency and suppresses the bulk recombination in the semiconductor, which are responsible for its outstanding catalytic performance.
Introduction
The development of catalysis techniques is still a significant objective due to their paramount importance for energy conversion. Photocatalysis and thermocatalysis have been studied for several decades, and substantial progress has been made in their corresponding research fields as two completely independent systems.1–6 The main advantage of photocatalysis is that it can utilize renewable solar energy to generate carriers (electrons and holes) and realize the initiation of redox reactions. However, compared to photocatalysis, thermocatalysis must be conducted at a higher temperature using an additional heater, which usually suffers from high energy consumption.7,8 Therefore, to overcome the current obstacles in thermocatalytic systems, it is inevitable to couple photocatalysis and thermocatalysis to drive reactions more efficiently. Recently, the synergetic effect of photo/thermocatalysis has been reported by several groups, where significant enhancement in catalytic activity was achieved for the oxidation of benzene and the CO hydrogenation reaction.8–11
The decomposition reaction of ammonium perchlorate (AP), as one of the representative thermocatalytic cases, has been the focus of the chemistry and material science communities for the last half-century.6,12,13 It is well-known that AP is the most widely used energetic oxidizer in solid rocket propellants, and its decomposition process can greatly influence the combustion performance of the propellant. In this thermocatalytic history, a variety of transition metal oxide materials have dominated. Especially, the use of zinc oxide (ZnO) as a catalyst has attracted much attention because of its low cost, nontoxicity, ease of availability, high electron mobility, and good physical and chemical stability.14–17 Meanwhile, ZnO is frequently studied as a promising photocatalyst both domestically and abroad.18–20 It is well acknowledged that the thermocatalytic mechanism of the decomposition of AP is very similar to the photocatalytic mechanism, consisting of an increase in the separation of electrons and holes.17 Therefore, the introduction of light into the thermocatalytic system, resulting in photo/thermocatalysis, holds tremendous promise to increase the catalytic activity of ZnO in this field for the AP decomposition reaction.
However, due to the wide bandgap (3.37 eV) of the ZnO semiconductor, the key step for determining the catalytic ability of ZnO specifically lies in the solar spectrum utilization efficiency and the charge-carrier separation.19,20 Recently, an approach involving coupling semiconductors with plasmonic metal nanoparticles (Ag,19,21 Au,22,23 Cu,24etc.) has attracted considerable attention as a means to extend the spectral response of ZnO toward visible light and improve its charge-carrier generation efficiency and suppression of bulk recombination. Among the plasmonic metal nanoparticles, Ag is regarded as one of the best materials because it possesses many unique properties such as bioaffinity, high chemical stability, and good charge storage capability.18 To achieve synergistic effects between the localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) of Ag nanoparticles and band-gap excitation from the ZnO semiconductor, the formation of hybrid Ag/ZnO catalysts with good contact is the key process.
Several methods to anchor Ag nanoparticles on ZnO surface such as photochemical deposition,18,25,26 soft-chemical approach27 and the precipitation–thermal decomposition method19,28 have been reported. In this study, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), as a relatively new class of porous materials synthesized from the self-assembly of organic linkers and metal joints into an infinite array with a high surface area, structural diversity, and tailorability, are used for the construction of the metal/semiconductor hybrid materials.29–31 One of the inherent superiorities of MOFs is their permanent porosity, which makes them attractive for confining guest species, particularly metal species, for the formation of metal ions@MOF hybrid materials with the metal precursor located in the MOF pores.32–34 Besides, due to their unique structures, MOFs have been used as novel templates to synthesize porous metal oxides with tailorable functionality, large surface areas and inter-connected pores.31 Thus, by pyrolysis of metal ions@MOF hybrids under an air atmosphere at a suitable temperature, the metal ion precursors and MOFs can be simultaneously transformed into metal nanoparticles and porous metal oxides, where the metal nanoparticles are highly embedded in the MOF-derived porous metal oxide network.
Herein, we report a novel method to fabricate Ag-embedded porous ZnO nanocomposites using zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), an important subclass of MOFs, as the host for Ag species and the template of ZnO. Ag NPs and ZnO NPs are successfully assembled into a porous rhombic dodecahedron structure to investigate the influence of Ag NPs on the thermocatalytic and photo-assisted thermocatalytic performance of AP decomposition. Ag–ZnO NCs result in enhanced catalytic activity for the thermal decomposition of AP, where the peak temperature decreases from 432 to 291 °C, and the activation energy decreases from 130.1 ± 9.3 to 57.7 ± 5.4 kJ mol−1; these values are even lower than that of ZnO (309 °C and 85.4 ± 9.1 kJ mol−1, respectively). Under UV and visible light, Ag–ZnO NCs afford remarkable enhancement in the thermocatalytic AP decomposition performance due to the electron transfer from ZnO to Ag and the generation of additional electron–hole pairs near the Ag–ZnO interface caused by the plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PRET) mechanism. Also, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that light is introduced in a thermocatalytic AP decomposition system.
Experimental
Materials and methods
All reagents and solvents were commercially available and used without further purification. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O), 2-methylimidazole (MeIm) and silver nitrate (AgNO3) were used as received from Aladdin Industrial Inc. (Shanghai, China). Methanol (CH3OH) was purchased from Beijing Tong Guang Fine Chemicals Company.
ZIF-8 was synthesized using the method described in the literature.29 Typically, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (810 mg, 40 mL) and MeIm (526 mg, 40 mL) were stirred in a methanolic solution at room temperature for 12 h. The white power of ZIF-8 was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with methanol, and dried under vacuum at 80 °C overnight. The as-synthesized ZIF-8 crystals were then immersed in a methanolic solution of AgNO3 under constant stirring for 12 h at room temperature. During this time, Ag+ ions were loaded within the micropores of ZIF-8 to obtain Ag+@ZIF-8. Finally, Ag+@ZIF-8 was pyrolyzed at 450 °C for 3 h under an air atmosphere at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 to obtain the hierarchical porous catalyst Ag–ZnO NCs. For comparison, pure ZnO was derived from ZIF-8 using a similar pyrolytic process to that of Ag–ZnO NCs.
Characterization
The crystalline structures of ZIF-8, Ag+@ZIF-8 and Ag–ZnO NCs were determined within the 2θ range of 5°–90° using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/max IIIA) with a Cu-Kα1 source (λ = 0.15406 nm). The chemical structures of the prepared samples were characterized via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Thermo Nicolet iS50) with a resolution of 4 cm−1 in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. The morphology and components of the synthesized products were characterized using a Helios Nanolab 600i scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an attached X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), respectively. TEM (JEM-2100F) was equipped with an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). TEM (JEM-2100F) was employed to provide selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization was carried out on an ESCALAB 250Xi instrument to analyze the surface properties and chemical states of the synthesized products. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were screened via nitrogen adsorption and desorption at 77 K using a Quantachrome Automated Surface Area analyzer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of ZnO and Ag–ZnO were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 315 nm on a Horiba Fluoromax-4 instrument. UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded using a HITACHI U-4100 spectrophotometer.
Catalytic activity measurement
The thermocatalytic performances of ZnO and Ag–ZnO NCs for AP decomposition were studied via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) analysis using a thermal analyzer (SDT-Q 600, TA Instruments USA) under an N2 atmosphere over the temperature range of RT-500 °C. The light-assisted thermocatalytic performance of the obtained Ag–ZnO for the AP decomposition was measured via in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS) in the range from 650 to 4000 cm−1 at a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1 (number of scans, 32) on a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a highly sensitive MCT detector cooled by liquid N2. The DRIFTS cell was fitted with three windows (one quartz window for the irradiation of UV or visible light and two ZnSe windows for the detection of IR signal) and a heating cartridge that allowed the sample to be heated to 500 °C. The same amount of fine catalyst powder was placed in the sample holder every time and flattened to enhance the IR reflection. To measure the light-assisted thermocatalytic activity under UV or visible light irradiation from a Xe lamp (CHF-XM500), a UV light filter or UV-cut filter was placed between the Xe lamp and the quartz window, respectively.
Results and discussion
Morphological and structural characterization
The successful fabrication of Ag-embedded porous ZnO rhombic dodecahedron nanocomposites (Ag–ZnO NCs) is schematically displayed in Fig. 1. As can be seen, the fabrication strategy comprises initial loading treatment of ZIF-8 crystals in methanol solution containing Ag+ ions at room temperature to achieve Ag+@ZIF-8, followed by thermal annealing treatment in an air atmosphere. During the loading process, the Ag+ ions are loaded within the micropores of the ZIF-8 crystal by binding to the CC bond of the 2-methylimidazole linker to form a π complex, which results in Ag nanoparticles being embedded in porous ZnO rhombic dodecahedra in the final fabrication step.

The obtained Ag+@ZIF-8 crystals were carefully characterized via TEM, SEM, XRD and FTIR (Fig. 2). Fig. 2a shows the high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image of the Ag+@ZIF-8 crystals and the corresponding elemental maps of C, Zn and Ag, demonstrating that the adsorption of Ag+ ions was successful. Besides, from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Fig. S1, ESI†), the decrease in the surface area of the Ag+@ZIF-8 crystals (1076.1 m2 g−1) in comparison with that of the ZIF-8 crystals (1285.8 m2 g−1) also indicates that the micropores of ZIF-8 are occupied and/or blocked by Ag+ ions.33,34 As revealed by the SEM images (Fig. 2b and c), the obtained Ag+@ZIF-8 crystals retain the original rhombic dodecahedral morphology of ZIF-8 but exhibit rough surfaces with some large pores and cracks. The wide-angle XRD patterns of the ZIF-8 and Ag+@ZIF-8 crystals can provide a better understanding of this change. As shown in Fig. 2d, the positions of the diffraction peaks of the obtained ZIF-8 crystals well correspond to the simulated pattern from the Crystallographic Information File (CIF) reported by Yaghi et al.30 After Ag+ ion loading, some new diffraction peaks are observed at the 2θ values of 8.8°, 11.7°, 11.9° and 16.9°, which indicate that the structures of the ZIF-8 crystals have changed, leading to some defects.35,36 Besides, when Ag+@ZIF-8 is further reduced to Ag@ZIF-8 by sodium borohydride, the new peaks disappear and the XRD pattern of Ag@ZIF-8 is almost the same as that of pure ZIF-8 (Fig. S2, ESI†), indicating that some interactions may exist between Ag+ ions and ZIF-8.

To obtain evidence for the interactions between Ag+ ions and ZIF-8, FTIR analysis was performed, as shown in Fig. 2e. The characteristic peaks of ZIF-8 are observed at 420 cm−1, for the Zn–N stretching vibration, at 1574 cm−1, for the CN stretching vibration, and in the 600–1500 cm−1 region for the entire imidazole ring stretching and bending. Compared to the peak of pure ZIF-8, the appearance of a new peak at 1628 cm−1 for Ag+@ZIF-8, which is located between the positions of the CN (1574 cm−1) and CC (1680 cm−1) stretching vibrations, demonstrates that the Ag+ ions bind to CN of the MeIm linker via a π-complex mechanism.37 CN of the MeIm linker donates its π-bond electron to the empty s orbital of the Ag+ ion, whereas the Ag+ ion back-donates its d-orbital electrons to the empty π* orbitals of CN, forming Ag–(CN) linkage to enhance the adsorption of Ag+ ions.
By heating Ag+@ZIF-8 crystals in an air atmosphere, Ag–ZnO NCs were fabricated. Fig. 3a demonstrates the XRD pattern of the obtained Ag–ZnO NCs. As can be seen, the diffraction peaks perfectly corresponded to hexagonal wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS Card No. 36-1451) and cubic Ag (JCPDS Card No. 04-0783),38 indicating that the transformation of ZIF-8 to ZnO and the conversion of Ag+ ions to Ag occurred simultaneously and eventually yielded hybrid Ag–ZnO NCs during the pyrolysis process. This was also confirmed by the XPS results shown in Fig. 3b. All the signals in the survey spectrum of Ag–ZnO NCs could be ascribed to Zn, O, Ag and C. In the inset of Fig. 3b, the binding energies at around 373.8 and 367.8 eV with the splitting of 6 eV are indicative of the existence of metallic Ag, and peaks for other states are absent. It should be noted that the peak positions of Ag 3d shifted remarkably to lower binding energies compared with that of bulk metallic Ag (Ag 3d5/2, 368.2 eV; Ag 3d3/2, 374.2 eV), suggesting decrease in the electron density of Ag.18,25,28 This proposed electron transfer process from Ag to ZnO can be explained by the decrease in the electron density of Ag by the band theory, as shown in Fig. 3d. Due to the smaller work function of Ag (4.26 eV) than that of ZnO (5.2 eV), the Fermi level of Ag (Efm) is higher than that of ZnO (Efs). Hence, it is much easier for the electrons in Ag to transfer to adjacent ZnO during the formation of Ag–ZnO NCs, shifting Efs of ZnO in the composition to a higher value and Efm of Ag to a lower value; this finally results in an equivalent Fermi level (Ef).39,40 As a result, the equilibrated Fermi level electrons under visible light irradiation can be injected rapidly into the conduction band of ZnO via a surface phonon resonance (SPR) mechanism, and the photoexcited electrons on the conduction band of ZnO under UV irradiation can be more easily transferred to Ag NPs, enhancing the catalytic activity of Ag–ZnO NCs. On the other hand, the equilibrated Fermi level also indicates strong interaction between Ag NPs and ZnO NPs and further verifies the fabrication of Ag-embedded ZnO composites. Finally, the high loading content of Ag NPs in this composite (19.2 wt%) determined by the full peak fitting method using the Jade software is also beneficial for improved catalytic activity.

The morphology of Ag–ZnO NCs was further elucidated by SEM and TEM analyses, suggesting the successful preparation of Ag-embedded ZnO NCs. The representative SEM images (Fig. S3, ESI†) demonstrate that the obtained ZnO and Ag–ZnO NCs retain the pristine rhombic dodecahedron shape of parent ZIF-8, and the latter has a porous structure. The TEM images (Fig. 4a) confirm the porous structure of Ag–ZnO NCs, which consists of interconnected nanoparticles with void spaces. Furthermore, the elemental mapping images (Fig. 4b) reveal that Zn, O, and Ag are homogeneously distributed throughout the rhombic dodecahedron-shaped porous crystals, suggesting that the Ag nanoparticles are embedded in the ZnO network. Also, according to the HRTEM image (Fig. 4c), the two lattice fringes with spacing distances of 0.26 and 0.24 nm are assigned to the (002) plane of hexagonal ZnO and the (111) plane of cubic Ag, respectively.38 The corresponding SAED pattern (Fig. 4d) is in good agreement with the HRTEM result; it further confirms the successful preparation of Ag–ZnO NCs and indicates their polycrystalline characteristic. Besides, for the detailed analysis of the boundary between the ZnO and Ag nanoparticles, the Ag nanoparticle is marked with a yellow dotted circle, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4c. It can be found that some of the Ag lattice sites are incorporated into the ZnO surfaces, which indicates Ag and ZnO nanoparticles have good contact, resulting in efficient electron transfer.

Additionally, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms exhibited in Fig. S4a (ESI†) indicate the porous nature of Ag–ZnO NCs. The isotherms belong to a typical type IV curve and type H3 hysteresis loop according to the IUPAC classification, demonstrating the presence of mesopores in Ag–ZnO NCs. The mesopores originate from the open spaces between adjacent particles, as observed from the TEM image. Also, the average pore size calculated via the BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) method using the desorption branch of the isotherm (Fig. S4b, ESI†) is 26.7 nm. This mesoporous structure endows Ag–ZnO NCs with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 22.8 m2 g−1. Usually, this type of a porous structure contributes to the diffusion and transportation of reactant molecules by providing a variety of active sites, resulting in improvement in the catalytic activity of materials.
Thermocatalytic performance
The thermocatalytic effects of ZnO and Ag–ZnO NCs on the decomposition of AP were investigated via TG-DSC measurements. Fig. 5a and b show the DSC and TG curves of both pure AP and mixture of AP with ZnO and Ag–ZnO NCs at 3% mass basis under a heating rate of 10 K min−1. For pure AP, three thermal signals centered at 242 °C, 313 °C and 432 °C are observed, which correspond to the crystal transformation of AP from orthorhombic to cubic phase, low-temperature decomposition (LTD) and high-temperature decomposition (HTD). The LTD process has been proposed to be a heterogeneous process involving a series of chemical reactions, in which the decomposition process starts with the electron transfer in the AP subsurface to yield NH3 and HClO4 and ends on the unreacted NH3-covered surface due to the slow reaction rates for the decomposition of HClO4 and oxidation of NH3.15,16 The HTD process is assigned to the oxidation of NH3 by HClO4 in the gas phase.41

From the DSC curves (Fig. 5a), the endothermic peaks of AP without and with the catalysts are similar, indicating that the phase transformation of AP does not occur, whereas a significant difference in the exothermic processes suggests the disappearance of the HTD process. Consistent with the DSC curves, the TG curves (Fig. 5b) show that there are two weight loss steps for pure AP compared to a single weight loss step for AP mixed with the catalysts. Also, the decrease in temperature in the presence of Ag–ZnO NCs is more clear for the exothermic process at 291 °C and the decomposition at 263 °C, which are lower than those of the AP mixture with ZnO and pure AP, indicating the high catalytic activity of Ag–ZnO NCs. Moreover, it can be observed that the LTD peaks become sharper and stronger for the decomposition of AP in the presence of the catalysts, demonstrating that the release of exothermic heat is increased notably. As shown in Fig. 5c, when ZnO and Ag–ZnO NCs are added, the heat release is increased from 376 to 1096 and 1432 J g−1, respectively.
To further prove the high catalytic activity of the obtained Ag–ZnO NCs for the thermal decomposition of AP, DSC measurements were performed for pure AP, AP mixture with ZnO and AP mixture with Ag–ZnO NCs at different heating rates from 5 to 20 K min−1, which showed that the peak temperature is dependent on the heating rate (Fig. S5, ESI†). The relationship between the peak temperature and the heating rate can be depicted by the Kissinger correlation:  Here, β is the heating rate in °C min−1, Tp is the peak temperature in Kelvin, R is the ideal gas constant, Ea is the activation energy, and A is the pre-exponential factor.16,41,42 According to this equation, Ea for the thermal decomposition of AP with and without the catalysts can be calculated from the slope of the fitting straight line between the term ln(β/Tp2) and 1/Tp. Fig. 5d shows the experimentally measured values of ln(β/Tp2) versus 1/Tp. The Ea values for pure AP, AP mixture with ZnO and AP mixture with Ag–ZnO NCs are estimated to be 57.7 ± 5.4, 85.4 ± 9.1, and 130.1 ± 9.3 kJ mol−1, respectively. On the basis of the above results, both ZnO and Ag–ZnO NCs exhibit efficient catalytic activities for the thermal decomposition of AP. Also, the catalytic activity of Ag–ZnO NCs is higher than that of bare ZnO probably because the electron transfer from the ZnO semiconductor to Ag nanoparticles suppresses the bulk recombination of ZnO.
Light-assisted thermocatalytic performance
To explore the light-assisted thermocatalytic performance of the obtained Ag–ZnO NCs for the decomposition of AP, a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with an in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectrometer (in situ DRIFTS) was employed. The DRIFTS cell was fitted with a heating cartridge and three windows (one quartz window and two ZnSe windows), which allowed the samples to be programmed heated to 500 °C under the irradiation of a Xe lamp and detected in real-time. Fig. 6 shows the IR spectra of the decomposed gas products of pure AP and AP mixture with Ag–ZnO NCs in the dark and under UV and visible irradiation at different temperatures. The gas products are identified as H2O (3400–3800 cm−1), HCl (2830–3083 cm−1), N2O (2149–2416/1000–1200 cm−1), NO (1430–1750 cm−1) and NO2 (1200–1430 cm−1).41,43,44

The IR spectroscopy data show that the most easily detected gaseous product of AP and a mixture of AP with the catalysts is N2O. Also, it is well-recognized that the lower the decomposition temperature of AP, the higher the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Therefore, the decomposition temperature corresponding to the maximum absorption intensity of N2O (Tmax) can be used to determine the catalytic performance of Ag–ZnO NCs under different light irradiation conditions. Fig. 7a shows the curves demonstrating the intensity of the N2O absorption peak located at 2235 cm−1versus the heating temperature for the decomposition of AP with the addition of Ag–ZnO NCs in the dark and UV- and visible-light irradiation. The histogram in Fig. 7b shows the temperatures corresponding to the maximum absorption intensity of N2O for AP with Ag–ZnO NCs under different light irradiation conditions. It can be seen that Tmax for the thermal decomposition of AP assisted with visible light irradiation appears at 276 °C, which is lower than 293 °C for the decomposition under UV light irradiation and 301 °C in the dark. Based on the experimental results, we conclude that Ag–ZnO NCs exhibit the best catalytic effect on the visible light-assisted thermal decomposition of AP, which is probably due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Ag nanoparticles within the visible wavelength region.

Catalytic mechanism of Ag–ZnO NCs
According to the mechanism for the thermal decomposition of pure AP proposed by Jacobs, the decomposition process starts with proton transfer in NH4+ClO4− molecules to yield NH3 and HClO4 and finally ends with the decomposition of HClO4 and oxidation of NH3. When semiconductor materials (such as ZnO,16,42 g-C3N4,45,46 and CuO47) are applied in the decomposition of AP, one catalytic mechanism has been proposed as follows:e− + HClO4 → HClOx (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) + O−O− + NH3 → N2O + H2O + e−h+ + NH3 → N2O + H2O
In the above equations, HClO4 is adsorbed on the surface of the semiconductor nanoparticles and forms negative oxygen ions O− by binding to the thermally excited intrinsic electrons of the semiconductor materials. The thermogenerated O− and h+ exhibit powerful oxidation ability, which can further react with NH3 to form H2O and N2O. It should be noted that the decomposition of AP including the decomposition of HClO4 and oxidation of NH3 is accelerated by the semiconductor catalyst.
To understand the thermocatalytic and light-assisted thermocatalytic mechanisms of the Ag–ZnO NCs for the decomposition of AP, the PL spectra and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra were measured, as shown in Fig. 8. PL spectroscopy has been proven to be an effective technique to determine the charge recombination and migration efficiency of semiconductor materials.

Fig. 8a shows the PL spectra of the as-prepared ZnO and Ag/ZnO NCs measured at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm. It can be observed that the individual curves show three emission bands including a near UV emission at around 380–400 nm, a strong blue emission at about 450–470 nm, and a weak and broad green emission at about 550 nm.40 Also, the emission intensity of the PL spectrum of Ag–ZnO NCs is lower than that of ZnO, indicating that Ag NPs act as electron sinks and thus hinder the recombination of electrons and holes.25,39 For the thermocatalytic performance of the Ag–ZnO NCs for the decomposition of AP, as shown in Fig. 9a, the valence-band (VB) electrons of ZnO can be excited by heating energy over 250 °C to move to the conduction-band (CB).16,42 Then, in the presence of Ag NPs, the electrons transfer to Ag, leading to corresponding increase in the separation efficiency of electrons and holes, which is favorable for enhancing the thermocatalytic activity of Ag–ZnO NCs. In addition, with the assistance of the UV light irradiation, as shown in Fig. 9b, more electrons in VB of ZnO can be excited, further accelerating the thermal decomposition of AP.

Ag is regarded as one of the best plasmonic materials, which possesses localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the visible wavelength region.48,49 Also, the optical properties of the obtained ZnO and Ag–ZnO NCs were measured via UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), as shown in Fig. 8b. As can be observed, pure ZnO shows a typical absorption edge at about 385 nm in the UV region. For the Ag NP-embedded porous ZnO composites, there is a wide absorption peak at around 440 nm, which is caused by the LSPR characteristics of silver.25,50 The extended absorbance of Ag–ZnO NCs in the visible region has considerable practical importance to enhance catalytic activity due to the efficient utilization of visible light. Also, the red-shifted plasmon absorption provides some evidence of the interaction between Ag and ZnO, which is also in accordance with the XPS results.51
Hence, when Ag–ZnO NCs are exposed to visible light, the outstanding SPR property of Ag NPs makes them excellent light-harvesting antennae. This is followed by the generation of strong local electric fields, the intensity of which is several orders of magnitude higher than that of the far-field incident light.52 For this SPR-induced strong local electromagnetic field, Ag NPs can effectively concentrate the incident photon energy and transfer it to the neighbouring ZnO semiconductor via the plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PRET) mechanism, thereby remarkably enhancing the concentration of the electron–hole pairs in ZnO.53 As shown in Fig. 9c, under the irradiation of visible light and treatment of heat, SPR of the Ag NPs and the electron–hole pairs in ZnO can be excited simultaneously. The plasmonic hot electrons from Ag NPs can be rapidly injected into the conduction band of ZnO, further increasing the number of electrons in ZnO. Meanwhile, the electrons and holes are captured to accelerate the decomposition of HClO4 and oxidation of NH3, respectively, to finally decompose AP. Besides, the specific Ag-embedded porous rhombic dodecahedron ZnO structure provides a rich and stable interface between the plasmonic metal and semiconductor, which is the main reason for the outstanding catalytic activity of Ag–ZnO NCs for the thermal decomposition of AP under visible light irradiation. On the one hand, the rich and stable interface between Ag NPs and ZnO can be expected to make the electron transfer within the materials easier and quicker, resulting in higher activity. On the other hand, the special mesoporous structure is good for efficient mass transfer, offering more opportunities for the diffusion and adsorption of product molecules during the catalytic decomposition reaction of AP. Based on the above discussion, the visible light-enhanced performance of Ag–ZnO NCs for the thermal decomposition of AP can be due to the synergistic effect of the plasmonic effect of Ag NPs under visible light irradiation as well as the specific porous structure of Ag–ZnO NCs with a rich and stable interface.
Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared Ag-embedded porous ZnO nanocomposites using ZIF-8, an important type of MOF, as the host for Ag species and the template for ZnO. Also, the Ag nanoparticles and ZnO nanoparticles are simultaneously assembled into a porous rhombic dodecahedron structure, providing a rich and stable interface between them. The obtained Ag–ZnO NCs exhibit intensive thermocatalytic effects on the decomposition of AP, as evidenced by the decreased peak temperature of 291 °C and decreased activation energy of 57.7 ± 5.4 kJ mol−1. Due to the similarity between the thermocatalytic mechanism and photocatalytic mechanism of Ag–ZnO NCs associated with the effective separation of electrons and holes, the remarkably enhanced catalytic activity of Ag–ZnO NCs is reasonable under the assistance of UV and visible light. Especially, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Ag nanoparticles within the visible wavelength region is responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance because it can improve the generation of charge carriers while suppressing the bulk recombination in the ZnO semiconductor.
