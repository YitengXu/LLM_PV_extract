    , Accepted 27th July 2017First published on 28th July 2017AbstractHighly efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts are essential for water spitting via electrolysis in an economically viable fashion. However, the best catalytic performance is found with noble metal-based electrocatalysts, which presents a formidable obstacle for the commercial success of electrolytic water splitting-based H2 production due to their relatively high cost and scarcity. Therefore, the development of alternative inexpensive earth-abundant electrode materials with excellent electrocatalytic properties is of great urgency. In general, efficient electrocatalysts must possess several key characteristics such as low overpotential, good electrocatalytic activity, high stability, and low production costs. Direct synthesis of nanostructured catalysts on a conducting substrate may potentially improve the performance of the resultant electrocatalysts because of their high catalytic surface areas and the synergistic effect between the electrocatalyst and the conductive substrate. In this regard, three dimensional (3D) nickel foams have been advantageously utilized as electrode substrates as they offer a large active surface area and a highly conductive continuous porous 3D network. In this review, we discuss the most recent developments in nanostructured materials directly synthesized on 3D nickel foam as potential electrode candidates for electrochemical water electrolysis, namely, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We also provide perspectives and outlooks for catalysts grown directly on 3D conducting substrates for future sustainable energy technologies.Nitin K.

1. Introduction
The imminent shortage of fossil fuels and the ever-growing concerns of energy and environmental issues have triggered extensive research efforts to develop alternative energy sources. In this regard, electrochemical electrolysis of water is considered to be one of the most promising strategies for the production of hydrogen fuel.1,2 Economical water splitting necessitates highly efficient and robust electrocatalysts that can significantly accelerate the kinetics of the requisite two half-cell reactions, namely, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).3–6 Recently, significant effort has been devoted to developing highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts based on noble metals.7–14 At present, noble metal-containing catalysts such as Pt and its alloys, RuO2, and IrO2 remain the most efficient catalysts for the OER and HER. However, the high cost and relative scarcity of noble metals impede large-scale application of such catalysts and further progress of renewable energy technologies.11,15–19 To circumvent these shortcomings, enormous effort has been made to design and synthesize non-precious metal electrocatalysts involving earth-abundant materials as cost-effective alternatives for the OER and HER. Transition metal oxides, sulphides, phosphides, carbon materials, selenides, and mixed-metal complexes have been widely studied, demonstrating good performance towards the OER and HER.20,21 However, most of these electrocatalysts require overpotentials higher than those required for noble metal-based catalysts. Furthermore, improving the stability of these catalysts remains of utmost importance. Consequently, the design of low cost and efficient alternative electrode configurations with high activity and long-term stability is urgently needed for efficient water splitting.
Overall, two main strategies are employed to prepare electrodes for electrochemical applications. The first and most actively adopted technique involves the use of a powder form of the catalysts; typically, electrodes are fabricated by using a slurry of the electroactive material, a conductivity enhancer, and a binder on the conductive substrate.22,23 The main disadvantage of this approach is the requirement for an electrical insulating binder, because it decreases the contact area between the electrolytes and catalyst and can therefore block catalytically active sites, resulting in high resistance and reduced electrocatalytic performance.24 Moreover, the stability of the electrode is also relatively poor because the attached catalysts tend to peel off from the conductive substrate at high current density. The second main strategy for electrode preparation involves the use of noble metal-based materials that are directly electrodeposited onto conductive substrates such as nickel foam,25–27 copper foils,28,29 carbon cloth or paper,30–32 FTO,33 stainless-steel,34 and nickel foils.35 However, it is difficult to precisely control the accessible space between the deposited active materials. Thus, the electrode performance fades with increased film thickness due to the inability of the substrate to access the inner catalytically active sites. Furthermore, the complexity and high cost of this approach greatly hamper their practical applications. Therefore, the development of fabrication techniques for cost-effective three-dimensional (3D) electrodes is necessary for successful electrochemical applications.
Novel 3D, porous metallic materials possessing high specific surface areas and open-pore hierarchical structures have attracted great attention because they can significantly reduce the diffusion length of ions, enhancing both the ionic and electronic conductivity. Therefore, a possible future direction for electrocatalyst design is the combination of different structural dimensionalities to generate a nanostructured catalyst–support composite that provides high conductivity with a large surface area and high stability. To this end, nickel foam (NF), a cheap commercial material, has been widely used as a substrate and a support for electrode materials because of its high electronic conductivity, desirable 3D open-pore structure, and high specific surface area. Furthermore, the microholes and zigzag flow channels within NFs provide excellent mass transport and a large surface area per unit area.36 To date, a wide range of substrates, e.g. different metal foams, meshes, metal foils, and fabrics, have been explored as a current collector for electrochemical applications such as lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, and most importantly water splitting. NF has attracted particular attention because porous NF is a low cost and conductive material with a large electro-active surface area, which is ideal for loading catalysts and increasing electrochemically active sites. Furthermore, with the great demand for high surface area current collectors in energy applications, porous NF has particular advantages in enhancing the mass transport of electrolytes. The direct growth of active materials on nickel foam also enhances the catalyst–substrate contact for efficient electron transport during water splitting reactions. While supercapacitors and battery electrodes remain the dominant applications of NF, it has been reported that electrode materials deposited on this material demonstrated superior OER activity to those of nickel foils and meshes.34 They can be applied either in their native form or can be decorated with active materials; in the latter case, the foam acts both as a current collector and as a support matrix. Therefore, growing a nanostructured earth-abundant catalytic material on a NF substrate is a promising platform for the development of advanced electrode materials for energy storage/conversion devices. Until recently, a 3D electrode on nickel foam for the OER and HER was not widely investigated, even though 3D NFs have a porous hierarchical structure and are inexpensive and easily fabricated. Therefore, because of the prevalence of earth-abundant electrocatalysts directly grown on nickel foam, the present review covers the most recent developments in the fabrication of nanostructured materials on 3D nickel foam substrates designed for electrolytic water splitting for H2 production. The limitations and prospects of 3D NF-based nanocatalysts are also discussed.
2. Electrochemical water electrolysis
Water electrolysis can produce pure oxygen and hydrogen gas by an electrochemical process in which electrical energy provides the driving force for the requisite chemical reactions. The thermodynamic voltage of water splitting is 1.23 V at 25 °C and 1 atm, but much higher potentials are needed to drive efficient water splitting; this excess potential, namely the overpotential, is required to overcome the intrinsic activation barriers during the electrode reaction. As a result, the development of highly active materials is greatly needed to reduce the overpotential and make the water-splitting reaction an energy-efficient process. Recently, numerous efforts have characterised the mechanism, catalyst compositions, catalyst structures, and performance criteria for electrolytic water splitting.37–41
Because of its high-energy consumption, water electrolysis is currently used for just 4% of the world's hydrogen production. Therefore, the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts is actively being pursued. In terms of energy and environmental issues, water electrolysis is considered to be an efficient and clean technology to generate hydrogen and oxygen since there are no side reactions that could yield undesirable by-products [i.e., water electrolysis is simply 2H2O + (4e−) → O2 + 2H2]. Furthermore, the production of hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis using renewable energy sources has the smallest environmental impact relative to other approaches. Although electrochemical water electrolysis was first observed in acidic water, an alkaline medium such as sodium or potassium hydroxide (NaOH/KOH) is preferred in industrial applications, since corrosion can be more easily controlled under these conditions and the required infrastructure is cheaper. The two half-cell reactions of water splitting, namely, HER on the cathode and OER on the anode, in acidic or alkaline media are shown below.38
In an acidic medium:4e− + 4H+ → 2H22H2O → 4H+ + 4e− + O2
In an alkaline medium:4e− + 4H2O → 4OH− + 2H24OH− → 2H2O + 4e− + O2
Ideal HER or OER electrocatalysts should satisfy the following two basic requirements. Firstly, the catalyst for each half reaction must be highly active to ensure that a minimum overpotential can produce a large current density. Secondly, the catalyst must exhibit long-term stability. It is also desirable that the production cost of the catalyst be low. Therefore, efficient non-precious metal water-splitting catalysts based on earth-abundant materials are continually being developed, and significant progress in the understanding of their properties has emerged.38,42–50
3. Direct growth of nanostructured materials on 3D nickel foam
Generally, nickel foam (NF) is produced by coating Ni metal on a polymer substrate (e.g., a polyurethane matrix) using chemical vapour deposition (CVD) or electrochemical deposition.51,52 Subsequently, the polyurethane foam and its impurities (such as sulphur and carbon) are removed by sintering or pyrolysis at high temperature to give highly pure NF with a wide range of porosities (70–98%) and pore sizes (450 μm to 3.2 mm).51,53 Usually, the NF pore size is dependent on the polymer template, though it typically ranges from 5 to 130 ppi (pores per inch). The 3D architecture of NF leads to a large surface area on which electrochemical reactions can occur, making NF a very attractive material for various applications (Fig. 2). Note, however, that the actual surface area measurement of NFs is quite difficult.

Prior to the deposition of active materials on the NF substrate, the surface oxide layer formed by exposing the NF to air must be cleansed with a concentrated HCl solution. The hydrothermal routes is perhaps the most widely employed and promising technique to directly synthesize nanostructured materials on NFs because the resultant chemical composition, structure, and morphology can be easily manipulated. Furthermore, this approach is a relatively inexpensive and simple route for producing active material films on NF substrates. The electrode thickness depends on several experimental factors including the reaction time and temperature. Over the past decade, intensive efforts of numerous research groups have led to great success in developing transition metal-based electrocatalysts on NFs for electrochemical water oxidation. The deposition of active catalysts onto two-dimensional (2D) substrates is usually limited because of the number of accessible active sites; as a result, only a few outer layers remain in contact with the electrolytes.27 To date, the performance of transition metal-based water splitting catalysts has not been practical because most of the synthetic techniques require a binder and a conductive agent, and many transitional metal-based hydroxides, oxides, and chalcogenides are poor conductors.54,55 Consequently, binders or conductive agents significantly increase the “dead volume”, thereby reducing the catalytic performance and efficiency of the active material.55,56 To overcome these issues, 3D charge-conducting nanostructures are used to support the nonconductive active materials, while also serving as a self-standing current collector. Additionally, bubbles generated during water splitting reactions tend to accumulate on the planar substrates, resulting in significant bubble overpotential under high current densities.57 To circumvent these issues, electrocatalysts have been synthesized on conductive NFs; indeed, due to its 3D interconnected porous structure, NF offers a high surface area, good electrical conductivity, and good structural stability. Furthermore, the direct growth of electrocatalysts on a conductive NF substrate provides a convenient and binder-free approach to give a strongly bonded electrocatalyst on the NF, yielding a relatively low contact resistance because of the contact between the active material and the substrate. Thus, the macroporous NF substrate enables facile charge and fast mass transport since all the catalytic nanostructures are in direct contact with the NF substrate, ensuring that all the nanostructures of the electrode participate in the catalytic reaction, as shown in Fig. 1. Lastly, as compared to bulk and solid materials, 3D nanostructures significantly facilitate bubble convection away from the electrode surface, particularly at high current densities, preventing them from accumulating at the electrode surface and damaging the catalyst, which improves cyclability.58
To date, substantial effort and progress have been devoted to developing nickel foam-based electrocatalysts for supercapacitors and lithium ion batteries with high activity and stability.59–72 In general, supercapacitor devices are divided into two major categories: electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors.59 Due to their good electrical conductivity, long cycle life, and low cost, carbon-based materials and graphene are known to be ideal electrode materials for EDLCs.60,61 However, these materials suffer from a low specific capacitance. In contrast, pseudocapacitors usually rely on redox reactions, thus providing a much higher specific capacitance than EDLCs. Among the numerous materials available for use as supercapacitors, nanostructured transition metal-based catalysts have attracted considerable attention. Indeed, the excellent pseudocapacitive performance resulting from their high capacitance, good rate capability, and exceptional cycling stability make such catalysts promising candidates for high-performance electrochemical energy storage applications.62–68 Furthermore, the direct preparation and growth of active materials on conductive substrates (such as NF) can significantly improve the supercapacitor performance because of its novel binder-free electrode design.67 The major advantage of using macroporous NF as a substrate for the growth of electroactive materials is the high density and uniformity of the grown nanostructures; the resultant 3D hierarchical structures lie perpendicular on the NF substrate and are well separated from each other.61,62 Consequently, the nanostructured arrangement leads to better charge transfer kinetics and reduced ion diffusion lengths.63,64
Similarly, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have also attracted significant attention as power sources for portable electronic devices due to their high energy density and long cycle life. However, because of their poor electrical conductivity and large volume expansion during the cycling process, many powder-based anodic materials suffer from rapid capacity fading, leading to poor cycling stability.69–71 One promising approach to address these drawbacks and to improve their electrochemical performance is the rational design and direct growth of active materials on conductive NF substrates.72–83 The combination of active materials with NF has many merits for LIBs since NF is a monolith and can be employed directly as a current collector, providing both mechanical stability and an increased electrode/electrolyte contact area, which is beneficial for a high current rate performance. Additionally, the 3D NF structures can enhance ion transport by shortening the diffusion time, enabling fast charge transfer pathways and avoiding the use of binders and conducting additives.84 Finally, such novel nanoscale structures, with large free spaces between the grown hierarchical structures, allow facile electrolyte penetration and accommodate volume expansion during Li+ insertion and desertion.85 Therefore, exploring the use of NF as a substrate for the development of nanostructured electrocatalysts can play a vital role in achieving widespread implementation of clean energy systems. Until now, various nanostructures, including nanoparticles, nanosheets, films, nanoarrays, nanorods, hierarchical structures, and composites, were grown directly on NF substrate electrodes, exhibiting promising OER and HER efficiencies; thus, they possibly serve as suitable alternatives to the expensive and scarce noble metal-based catalysts (Fig. 3). In the following sections, we will discuss recent advances in the direct growth of various transition metal–nickel foam-based materials and their electrochemical performance towards the OER and HER.

3.1 Nickel chalcogenides
Relative to other transition metals such as Fe and Co, Ni alloys and their composites have been the most investigated materials for OER and HER electrode applications because of their superior stability and excellent resistance towards corrosion in alkaline media.86 However, employing Ni metal alone leads to relatively low catalytic activity and low resistance to intermittent electrolysis. Therefore, researchers are interested in using Ni alloys or their composites in conjunction with other metals as electrode materials for the OER and HER. In this respect, several studies have been performed involving various Ni-based electrodes on NF. In particular, nickel sulphides (Ni3S2 and NiS) have been the most studied materials, demonstrating promising electrochemical behaviour because of their high electrical conductivity and stability.
In the case of nickel sulphide, NF acts not only as a support material but also as a Ni source for the formation of nickel sulphide because it facilitates the unidirectional diffusion of Ni ions from its surface towards the solution.87–92 Nickel sulphide exists in several crystal phases with different morphologies and exhibits differing degrees of catalytic activity, depending on its morphology and phase. The first report of excellent electrocatalytic activity with low overpotential of Ni3S2 grown on NF for the OER was disclosed by Zhou et al.;87 the electrocatalysts were prepared by simple solvothermal sulfurization of the NF using sulphur as the S source. Afterwards, several groups reported the hydrothermal synthesis of nickel sulphide by varying the S source with slight modifications to the reaction parameters. For instance, Ouyang et al. reported the hydrothermal synthesis of hierarchical Ni3S2 nanorod arrays assisted by pre-treatment of the NF using HCl as the full water splitting electrocatalyst.88 The Ni3S2 nanostructures showed excellent catalytic activity and stability towards both the HER and OER, with low overpotentials of 200 and 217 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. The superior electrocatalytic activity and uniform morphology of the HCl-treated NF were attributed to the activation of the NF surface following the acid treatment. The synthetic conditions, sulphur sources, and the obtained morphologies and phases of Ni sulphides that have been reported to date are briefly summarised in Table 1, and their electrocatalytic performances towards the HER and OER under alkaline conditions are listed in Table 2.

Ni3S2 in the form of nanosheets on NF was subsequently used for water splitting by Feng et al.89 The study reported that the high-index facet of the Ni3S2 nanosheets greatly improves the OER activity, which even outperformed noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Moreover, it was also highly active in the HER, demonstrating quite clearly that nickel sulphides have great potential as bifunctional electrocatalysts for the overall water splitting reaction.89In situ grown Ni3S2/NF was found to give ∼100% faradaic yield towards both the HER and OER with remarkable catalytic stability for over 200 h due to the synergistic catalytic effects produced by the nanosheets and the exposed {10} high-index facets. Our recent work on spider web-like Ni-nanosheets deposited on Ni3S2/NF shows the importance of morphological control of the Ni-nanosheets for OER activity and stability.90 In this case, the deposition of spider web-like Ni-nanosheets was carefully controlled by varying specific experimental factors such as the precursor concentration; uniform Ni-nanosheets were subsequently deposited on the initially formed Ni3S2 at lower precursor concentrations. Although the overpotential was not affected significantly, the Tafel slope decreased significantly from 110 to 63 mV dec−1 for the spider web-like Ni-nanosheets.90 The results indicate that the performance of the metal sulphide electrocatalysts could be fine-tuned and further optimised with judicious morphological control.
Nickel sulphides have many different phases depending on the sulphur and nickel content, including NiS, Ni3S2, NiS2, Ni3S4, Ni9S8, and Ni7S6; for this reason, phase selective synthesis of nickel sulphide is very difficult.91 Zhu et al. reported the synthesis of NiS microspheres on NF using sulphur powder as the S source. The resultant bifunctional electrocatalyst displays good water oxidation activity and stability, with an overpotential of 158 mV, to achieve 20 mA cm−2 for the HER and 50 mA cm−2 at 335 mV for the OER in 1.0 M KOH.91 This result is notable since most studies only report separate electrocatalytic activity towards the OER and HER without providing the overall water splitting performance in a two-electrode electrolyser system. The NiS microspheres required a cell voltage of 1.64 V to afford a water splitting current density of 10 mA cm−2, and a constant potential of 1.67 C was well maintained for 35 h without significant decay in the activity. The cell voltage is larger than that of noble metal-based Pt/C/Ni foams (1.53 V), but it is smaller than the values reported for Ni-based bifunctional catalysts on NF (Ni3S2/NF, ∼1.7 V).89 Interestingly, Shang et al. studied the effect of surface treatment (i.e., acidification or oxidation) of NF prior to in situ nickel sulphide growth and their performance towards the OER was examined.92 It was found that the crystal phase and morphology of the nickel sulphide are strongly dependent on the surface treatment of NF; acidification of NF mainly produced NiS phases, whereas oxidation of NF mainly formed NiS2. However, both samples contained approximately 26 and 39 wt% of the nickel sulphide phase in the acidification and oxidation of NF, respectively. The formation of dissimilar crystal phases is attributed to the different reaction paths involved in the sulfurization of the surface-treated NF.92 The electrochemical tests demonstrated that nickel sulphide grown on acidified NF outperforms the oxidant-treated nickel sulphide/NF, indicating that acid-treated NF is a better choice for fabricating nickel sulphides for the OER. Moreover, it was reported that NiS shows superior OER activity relative to other nickel sulphide phases in alkaline media. Although our review is primarily focused on water splitting, we note the rapid development of nickel sulphide applications in fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors.62,93–97
Having briefly discussed the use of nickel sulphide as a potential water splitting electrocatalyst, the performances of these materials on NF in the OER and HER are summarized in Fig. 4 in terms of their Tafel slopes and overpotentials. Notably, available reports on nickel sulphides clearly indicate that they have been studied mostly for the OER, with a limited number of reports for the HER and the overall water splitting reaction. Similar trends are also observed with nickel-based double-layered hydroxides, as discussed in section 3.2. As seen in Fig. 4A, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion about the trend of the OER activity. However, it can be observed that the report by Shang et al. on the in situ growth of NixSy on acid-treated NF represents the best OER performance in alkaline media among the sulphides provided.92 The best OER activity (in terms of low overpotential and small Tafel slope) of NixSy can be attributed to the presence of mixed nickel sulphide phases such as Ni3S2, NiS2, and NiS. Since the OER relies on adsorption on the catalyst surface, the various electronic states of NixSy support the creation of active sites depending on the Ni-to-S ratio, which plays an important role in the electrocatalytic activity of the material. The two Ni3S2 nanorod samples exhibited similar Tafel plot values, with a slight difference in their overpotential. With identical chemical compositions and surface functional groups, the slight difference in their overall water splitting performance can be easily understood. That is, highly exposed active surface planes of the nickel sulphide-based electrocatalyst can achieve superior water splitting performance, as demonstrated in the case of SW Ni–Ni3S2 nanosheets.90 The 2D Ni-nanosheets deposited on the NF completely exposed all of the active crystal planes and sites. The exposed surface planes of the Ni-nanosheets and the Ni3S2 material ensure fast charge migration, resulting in the lowest Tafel value among all the nickel sulphide-based electrocatalysts shown in Fig. 4. As mentioned earlier, the number of reports on the HER activity of nickel sulphides is very limited; indeed, only two reports for the HER exist, namely, the Ni3S2 nanorod by Zhou et al.87 and NiS microspheres by Zhu et al.91 Among these, Ni3S2 nanorods grown on NF are superior to the NiS microspheres in catalysing the HER under alkaline conditions (Fig. 4B).87 Both the surface area and morphology play important roles in this activity; the former increases the number of active sites, whereas the latter is related to the number of available channels for ion diffusion. The superior HER activity of Ni3S2 is attributed to the combined effects of a large electrochemically active surface area, good conductivity, and advantageous surface chemistry beneficial for water dissociation, which is a critical step for H2 evolution under alkaline conditions.

Tang and co-workers presented an exciting new possibility of exploring the use of transition-metal selenides for the overall water splitting reaction.98 Specifically, NiSe nanowires as a bifunctional electrocatalyst were grown on NF by hydrothermal treatment using NaHSe as the Se source. The NiSe nanowires exhibited high activity, with an overpotential of 270 mV required to achieve 20 mA cm−2 for the OER. NiSe also proved to be efficient in catalysing the HER in basic media, and it also showed excellent stability for OER and HER electrolysis for over 100 CV cycles. Furthermore, the bifunctional electrode displayed a high-performance alkaline water electrolyser with 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.63 V (Fig. 5). However, it was presumed that the actual OER catalytic sites do not arise exclusively from the NiSe surface but also from NiOOH species formed on the NiSe surface.98

3.2 Layered double hydroxides
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which are composed of layers of divalent and trivalent metal cations [(M2+) and (M3+), respectively] coordinated to hydroxide anions, have been widely studied as catalysts. LDH materials have shown surprising performance as electroactive materials and have thus gained widespread attention as possible water oxidation catalysts.99,100 Additional details of the synthetic strategies and potential applications of LDHs in catalysis have been summarized by Fan et al.101 The limited specific surface area and conductivity of these materials should be further addressed for practical applications of LDHs as electrode materials. In order to address these problems, researchers have investigated the fabrication of directly grown LDH architectures on conducting surfaces such as NF, CNT, and GO, which offer the advantages of facile electron transport, electrolyte penetration, and large electrochemical active surface areas.
NiFe (oxy)hydroxide-based catalysts are regarded as one of the best performing nonprecious OER electrocatalysts in alkaline solutions.102 Lu and coworkers reported that NiFe-LDH grown on NF shows an OER performance with a small onset overpotential (∼230 mV) and Tafel slope (∼50 mV dec−1) and a large anodic current density of 280 mV, which can be achieved at 30 mA cm−2.103 The superior electrocatalytic activity has been attributed to the combination of an active NiFe-LDH phase and the unique hierarchical mesoporous 3D architectures, which possess a high active surface area resulting from the high porosity of NF. Further, the high OER activities of NiFe catalysts have been attributed to a synergistic effect caused by the incorporation of Fe into NiOOH. However, a complete understanding of the operative mechanistic and structural characteristics is not yet available.104 Yang et al. developed a two-step hydrothermal process to fabricate a hierarchical NiCoFe LDH nanoarray electrode on NF, as shown in Fig. 6.105 The ordered hierarchical LDH nanoarray has shown increased catalytic activity relative to that of LDH nanoparticles; the superior performance can be attributed to the small size, large surface area, and high porosity of the NiCoFe LDH nanoarray. A water oxidation overpotential of 233 mV was required to achieve a current density of 30 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec−1. Moreover, the ordered hierarchical LDH nanoarray possessed excellent structural stability in alkaline media for 10 h.

LDHs are fundamentally different from metal hydroxides because they consist of positively charged brucite-like host layers and charge-balancing interlayer anions.106 The incorporated anions and water between the layers and various metal cations (M2+/3+) result in a larger interlayer space and unique redox characteristics in LDHs, thereby providing a notable electrochemical performance towards water splitting, as shown in Fig. 7. Jiang et al. prepared directly grown nanosheet arrays of electrocatalytically active cobalt- and nickel-species (NiCo-LDH) for the OER.106 The OER activity of these NiCo-LDH nanosheets is attributed to their intrinsic layered structure, interconnected nanoarray configuration, and unique redox characteristics. Table 3 summarizes recent reports on nickel-based LDHs and their electrochemical activity towards the OER under alkaline conditions.

3.3 Nickel-based nitrides
Various transition metal or mixed metal-based hydroxides, oxides, phosphides, and nanocomposites such as layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have also been evaluated for water splitting. However, the widespread application of electrocatalysts based on these designs is significantly hindered due to their semiconducting or insulating nature, which to some extent hampers the electron transfer from the electrocatalysts to the supporting electrode. Although a single bifunctional electrocatalyst can simplify the water splitting system and lower its cost, the major challenge of a bifunctional catalyst effectively catalysing both the OER and HER by achieving high current density at low overall overpotential persists. Consequently, researchers have shown great interest in developing metal nitrides because of their low electrical resistance and good corrosion resistance, making them potentially effective water-splitting catalysts relative to their corresponding oxide and hydroxide counterparts.107–109 Recently, the two-step synthesis of a vertically aligned Fe2Ni2N nanoplate array on NF was achieved, as shown in Fig. 8.110 Broadly, the electrocatalytic activity of bimetallic metal nitrides is drawing more attention than their related monometallic counterparts due to their superior catalytic activities; the coordination of two or more metal species provides richer active sites and improved electronic conductivity, which are beneficial for enhanced water-splitting performance.111,112 Notably, Fe2Ni2N has demonstrated catalytic activity with a small onset overpotential of 200 and 110 mV at 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 34 and 101 mV dec−1 for the OER and HER, respectively. The higher activity of nitrides can be attributed to their relatively more disordered structures due to the incorporation of nitrogen. Zhang et al. reported the in situ growth of FeNi3N nanostructures on a conductive NF substrate as an efficient catalyst for the overall water splitting reaction.113 The bifunctional electrocatalytic electrode drove a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 202 and 75 mV and Tafel slopes of 40 and 98 mV dec−1 for the OER and HER, respectively. NiFe hydroxide was transformed into porous FeNi3Ni by thermal ammonolysis, a process developed by Yang et al. to prepare metal nitrides without the use of templates or high temperature sintering, involving the corresponding metal hydroxides/oxides.114 The advantage of this approach is that the NF acts not only as an electrode substrate but also serves as a slow-releasing Ni precursor, which is induced by redox-etching of the iron precursor (Fe3+) during the precipitation process. As a result, an additional Ni precursor is not required to produce iron–nickel nitride nanostructures on the conductive NF surface.

3.4 Nickel-based ternary sulphides and phosphides
Precious metal electrocatalysts such as IrO2 and RuO2 are the best performing OER catalysts. However, due to their low natural abundance and excessive cost, the use of these noble metal-based electrocatalysts is limited to an industrial scale.115–117 Besides transition metal sulphides and hydroxides, metal phosphide materials (e.g., Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, and Mo) have emerged as efficient electrocatalysts because of their unique catalytic and electronic properties, particularly as HER catalysts.37,118–120 The electrocatalytic activity of these materials exceeds those of other compounds such as carbide, nitride, and sulphide, mainly due to their moderate affinity for hydrogen and the electron-rich metal surface in the phosphide.121
Several efforts have been made to develop transition metal phosphide materials on the conductive NF substrate with controlled structures and compositions to achieve high performance in electrochemical water oxidation. For example, Li and coworkers were the first to prepare NiCo precursor nanosheet arrays via a facile urea precipitation method followed by phosphorization at high temperature to obtain a ternary NiCoP material (Fig. 9).122 The excellent OER electrocatalytic activity of NiCoP was attributed to the formation of Ni–Co oxo/hydroxo species such as NiOOH, Ni(OH)2, and Co3O4 on the NiCoP electrode surface during the OER due to the oxidation of Ni and Co atoms. In addition, Li et al. reported the synthesis of cobalt–nickel-phosphide nanowires (Ni@Co–Ni–P) on Ni foam by phosphorizing a cobalt carbonate hydroxide precursor using red phosphorus vapour at high temperature.123 The excellent OER and HER performances of the Ni@Co–Ni–P electrodes were largely attributed to the unique vertically-aligned and densely-packed polycrystalline nanowire structure of the ternary Co–Ni–P complex supported on the NF substrate. Notably, the Co–Ni–P nanowires maintained strong adhesion after long stability and durability tests. Furthermore, it was found that during the OER under alkaline conditions, metal hydroxides/oxides formed on the metal phosphide catalysts. As a result, the formation of phosphide/hydroxide heterostructures is believed to play an important role in the enhancement of OER activity due to a favourable electronic configuration and the synergistic effect between the phosphides and hydroxides. However, the formation mechanism and specific causes of the enhancement in water splitting require further investigation.

One-dimensional morphologies of catalysts, such as nanowires and nanorods, have received significant attention because of the large number of exposed catalytic active sites at the electrode–electrolyte interface. For example, Sivanantham et al. found that bifunctional NiCo2S4 nanowires supported on a NF catalyst show a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of 1.63 V with excellent activity and stability over 50 h, thus proving to be an efficient electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.124 Furthermore, this NiCo2S4 nanostructure exhibited low overpotentials of 260 and 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for the OER and HER, respectively, which are superior to those for the corresponding NiCo2O4 supported on NF. The growth of NiCo2S4 nanowire arrays on the NF substrate was achieved using a two-step hydrothermal method, as shown by the schematic representation in Fig. 10. First, uniform Ni–Co-carbonate hydroxide nanowire arrays were produced. Hydrothermal treatment of Ni2+ and Co2+ in the presence of urea, followed by etching and precipitation in a sodium sulphide environment at higher temperature, produced spinel NiCo2S4 nanowire arrays. The active sulphur anions (S2−) released from sodium sulphide replace the CO32− and OH− anions of the Ni–Co-carbonate hydroxide precursor during the anion exchange reaction to form black-coloured NiCo2S4 nanowires on the NF.124 The electrocatalytic performances of nickel-containing sulphides and phosphides are listed in Table 4, along with those of iron nickel nitrides.

3.5 Molybdenum sulphides
Molybdenum-based nanostructures, particularly molybdenum sulphide (MoS2), have been extensively investigated as alternative water oxidation electrocatalysts to noble metals as they contain highly active unsaturated sulphur atoms and catalytically active edge sites.125–132 Although bulk MoS2 has been known to be active for the HER, the development of MoS2-based catalysts has been very slow due to their poor activity.133 Nevertheless, recent advances in materials science have revealed that MoS2 structures with more exposed active edge sites possess excellent catalytic performance.134,135 However, the poor electric conductivity and electrochemical stability and high solubility in acidic electrolytes limit their catalytic efficiency and practical utilization.119 Therefore, researchers have prepared hybrid structures consisting of MoS2 interfaced with cobalt or nickel sulphide, which have proved to be excellent catalysts towards the OER as compared to the pure MoS2 catalyst.136,137
To address the poor electric conductivity and mass transport limits, it is necessary to directly grow or attach MoS2 on a conductive substrate such as ITO, carbon nanotubes, or nickel foam.125,137 Yan et al. reported that directly grown porous MoS2 microspheres on the conductive NF substrate possess good contact and electron transfer with superior conductivity, which greatly reduces the overpotential due to their large surface area and the large number of oxygen-evolution catalytic sites per unit mass.138 Furthermore, it was shown that the internal structure of porous microspheres would be easily accessible to the electrolyte, resulting in a high current density and stability. At the same time, Zhang et al. investigated the MoS2/Ni3S2 heterostructures using density functional theory (DFT) and found that the heterostructure interfaces synergistically favour chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen-containing intermediates (Fig. 11).136 Earlier investigations suggested that under-coordinated Mo–S sites along the edges of MoS2 possess a high chemisorption capability for hydrogen, in an analogous fashion to Pt. As a result, significantly enhanced catalytic activity for overall water splitting was observed for MoS2/Ni3S2 heterostructures.139 For the OER, the MoS2/Ni3S2 heterostructures show a low overpotential of 218 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 88 mV dec−1, whereas an overpotential of 110 mV was observed at 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 83 mV dec−1 for the HER, thus proving to be one of the best overall water splitting nickel sulphide-based materials (Table 5). Furthermore, as an alkali electrolyser, this heterostructure delivers a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a cell voltage of ca. 1.56 V.

Following the crucial finding that molybdenum sulphide is an efficient and economical electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, Yoon and coworkers reported a one-step hybridization strategy to grow cobalt and molybdenum composite materials on NF (Fig. 12).140 The hybrid nanomaterial displayed superb catalytic activity and stability for overall water splitting as an overpotential of only 1.58 V was required at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Specifically, overpotentials of 143 and 380 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline media were found for the HER and OER, respectively. The OER activity was very comparable to that of the state-of-the-art catalyst IrO2, which shows an overpotential of 380 mV at a similar current density. Similar to the aforementioned MoS2-based materials, the HER catalytic activity of this hybrid material was attributed to the presence of unsaturated sulphur sites of molybdenum sulphide. However, the OER activity was believed to originate from the catalytically active Co species layer and the synergistic effect of CoS-doped β-Co(OH)2. Therefore, the hybridization of both OER and HER materials could lead to new developments in bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

3.6. Towards performance optimisation of the electrocatalysts

Fig. 13 summarizes a comparison of the electrocatalytic performance of selected composite electrocatalysts directly grown on NF substrates towards the OER and HER under alkaline conditions. Clearly, ternary phosphide gives the best HER performance in alkaline media, followed by nitride. The sulphides are not active materials towards the HER. The good OER activity (i.e., the low overpotential and small Tafel slope) of Fe2Ni2N is attributed to the incorporation of nitrogen into the electrode material, which provides more active sites due to its disordered structure.141 The good electrical conductivity of the nitride relative to other materials is believed to be responsible for the decrease in charge resistance; subsequently, the nitride material facilitates faster electron transfer through the conductive NF substrate.108,118,142
 Fig. 13  Comparison of (A) OER and (B) HER activities showing Tafel slopes (mV dec−1) with overpotentials (mV) in alkaline media. 
Transition metal phosphide materials have been shown to be robust and efficient catalysts for the HER due to their unique catalytic and electronic properties, and detailed overviews have appeared with a focus on their synthesis, phosphide composition and structure, and their applications in the HER and energy storage.37,143 As seen in Fig. 13, the HER performance of Ni@Co–Ni–P electrodes outperforms those of other NF-based materials in alkaline media. The superior performance of this phosphide is attributed to the intrinsic Co–Ni–P ternary nanowire structures and the effect of Ni doping, which is believed to enhance the electrocatalytic performance.144 Furthermore, the conductive NF surface with firmly grown vertically-aligned polycrystalline Co–Ni–P nanowires provides exposed active sites and thus efficient conductive pathways, which facilitate facile mass transfer of the electrolyte and the release of generated hydrogen gas. However, an in-depth understanding of the origin of the catalytic performance that arises from the Ni dopant is missing. Additionally, the formation of a hydroxide layer on the phosphide surface, caused by long exposure in the alkaline electrolyte, must be further examined. The OER activity of the material grown on NF (e.g., Fe2Ni2N and NiCo2S4) was superior to that of the commercial Ir/C catalyst.110,145 These results indicate the significant role of NF as a binder-free electrode substrate in electrochemical catalysis, particularly for the OER. To date, however, no catalysts have been found to surpass the HER activity of commercial Pt/C.146 Therefore, even though inexpensive nanomaterials with low overpotential are now available (e.g., Fe2Ni2N or Ni@Co–Ni–P), additional effort is required to develop new materials with ternary and quaternary compositions instead of binary nanocomposites to achieve superior water splitting performance.
4. Catalysts on nickel foam in an acidic medium
In water splitting, one of the major challenges is to develop non-noble metal electrocatalysts that have high activity towards both the HER and OER in strongly acidic or alkaline solutions to minimize the overpotential. However, to meet various application conditions, the development of highly efficient, noble metal-free and inexpensive water splitting catalysts that function well over a wide pH range is desperately needed. Proton exchange membranes (PEMs) and microbial electrolysis cells (MEC) require catalysts that function well under acidic and neutral conditions, respectively.147,148 However, stable HER catalysts are required for alkaline water electrolysis under strongly basic media.149 These requirements are great challenges for electrocatalysts because of their possible inactivity and instability under extremely acidic or alkaline environments.150,151
Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays grown on NF were found to be efficient electrocatalysts in neutral and basic media for both the HER and OER. However, the same material was ineffective for the HER in acidic media and for the OER in both acidic and neutral media (Fig. 14).89 This can be understood as the OER is kinetically sluggish, due to its multistep proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), which typically requires a substantial driving overpotential of the thermodynamic potential (1.23 V) for water splitting.106,152 Additionally, the poor activity in acidic media is attributed to the leaching of Ni from Ni3S2 and, as a result, the nanosheets detach from the NF, suggesting that the surface of the nickel sulphide suffers from corrosion under acidic conditions. Therefore, while the advantage of using NF as an electrode support and a substrate is that it can be used directly for electrocatalytic OER and HER under alkaline conditions, the inability to use NF in acidic media poses a formidable challenge and limits industrial applications of this electrode material. Interestingly, integrated Ni2P-nanorods/Ni by direct phosphorization of NF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction under acidic conditions.153 The as-fabricated electrode materials also displayed good durability and stability, although a slight decay was observed in activity for over 1000 cycles in acidic media, mainly due to the reduced catalyst/electrolyte contact and the Ni2P structural rearrangement. Therefore, with a prudent material choice, NF-based water splitting in acidic media might be feasible, thus calling for further efforts to develop efficient and stable catalysts in acidic media to suppress electrode degradation and thus increase the lifetime.

5. Perspectives and future directions
In this review, particular attention was given to the development of inexpensive, non-noble metal electrocatalysts on nickel foam substrates for water splitting. Nickel foam serves as an ideal 3D substrate for the growth of nanomaterials with well-defined porous structures. To date, various nanostructures including nanoparticles, nanosheets, films, nanoarrays, nanorods, hierarchical structures, and composites have been grown directly on NF substrate electrodes and have exhibited promising OER and HER efficiencies, which could serve as suitable alternatives to expensive and scarce noble metal-based catalysts. The most attractive feature of earth-abundant catalysts on NF may be their ability to function as bifunctional catalysts. Various transition metal (e.g., Fe, Ni, Co, and Mo)-based sulphides, phosphides, and nitrides have been studied for nanostructure fabrication, composition optimization, and performance improvement. The advantages of these transition metal-based catalysts are that they are structurally and compositionally diverse, thus exhibiting huge potential for further improvement in catalytic performance. However, an in-depth understanding of the origin of each specific catalytic performance is still in its infancy. Therefore, further refinement of theoretical predictions and the pursuit of new structural motifs and compositions will undoubtedly benefit this fledgling field for the broad application of NF-based water splitting.
As outlined in this review, although considerable advances have been made in the development of NF-based electrode materials for water splitting, several challenges remain before this substrate can find viable practical applications in overall water splitting. The main challenges lie in the limited diversity of directly grown nanomaterials. Nickel-based materials can be grown on NF because Ni+ ions are produced on the surface of NF during the hydrothermal reactions. Furthermore, the instability of the NF substrate as well as nickel-based nanostructure active phases in acidic media is a crucial issue that must be overcome before the broad application of NF-based electrode materials in water splitting can be realised. Therefore, it would be intriguing to develop acid-resistant 3D NF-based electrodes. To this end, graphene replica of NF may circumvent the difficulties associated with acidic media and the water splitting process. It is also necessary to develop synthetic methods to fabricate previously unattainable material phases that are electrocatalytically active and acid-resistant. Finally, the lack of a highly active and efficient electrocatalyst towards the HER is a major obstacle that must be overcome. As a result, it is highly desirable to develop highly efficient bifunctional catalysts that can simultaneously catalyse the HER and OER for clean and renewable energy technologies. Furthermore, hydrothermally assisted growth on NF is the most suitable approach for almost all materials because this method offers the advantage of preparing catalysts with various morphologies of a hierarchical nature. However, the main drawback of the hydrothermal method is the lack of control over the quantity of the catalyst grown on the NF substrate.
In order to use NF widely as an electrode support for electrochemical water splitting applications, the following areas require further study.
5.1 Development of new materials
Through simple hydrothermal approaches, several non-noble metal-based electrocatalyst nanostructures have been constructed on NF substrates for overall water splitting. An ideal non-noble water splitting electrocatalyst should: (i) have a high efficiency similar to that of noble metals, (ii) possess good durability and high catalytic stability over a wide pH range, (iii) be inexpensive, and (iv) be scalable to ensure a broad range of commercial uses. To meet these requirements, catalysts with suitable compositions must be developed. Regarding the chemical composition of the catalyst, transition metal Fe, Co, Mo and Ni compounds on NF are promising candidates for future water splitting electrocatalysts due to their natural abundance and potential catalytic activity. In order to boost stability, incorporation of other elements may be necessary since certain alloy phases demonstrate excellent stability under acidic or alkaline conditions. Furthermore, careful control of the electrocatalyst composition allows modification of the electronic structure of the active sites to optimize the intrinsic activity of the catalysts. Finally, an increased number of exposed active sites and better contact with the electrolyte should be emphasised in design strategies of these catalysts.
5.2 Mechanistic investigations
DFT calculations provide a powerful tool to identify the active species and refine the performance of catalysts, and additional effort is needed to pinpoint the exact catalytic/reaction mechanism of NF-based electrocatalysts.123 However, objectively evaluating the activity of OER and HER bifunctional electrocatalyst is not straightforward because the performance can be affected by several factors including pre-treatment of the NF substrate, operating conditions, and structural details of the materials. Nevertheless, detailed investigations on the mechanisms of NF-based OER and HER electrocatalysts are not only of scientific importance, but can also offer rational guidance for the optimization of nanomaterial performance.
5.3 Acidic electrolyte environments
Ideal electrocatalysts for both the OER and HER must operate within the same pH range to achieve electrochemical water splitting, and in order to minimize the overpotential of the electrolysis system, water splitting should be conducted in strongly acidic or basic solutions. However, these conditions pose a great challenge for non-noble metal electrochemical water splitting catalysts, since a highly active catalyst under alkaline conditions is usually inactive or unstable in an acidic electrolyte due to metal dissolution and corrosion. The majority of reported NF-based non-precious bifunctional catalysts are capable of functioning in alkaline environments with superb OER catalytic activity, but this is lost under extremely acidic conditions. The leaching of metal species from the electrocatalyst surface and the structural changes of the catalyst supported on nickel foam are the major reasons behind the inactivity in acidic media.89,153 One possible approach to overcome these issues is to design phosphides or selenides of Fe-, Co-, and Ni-based electrocatalysts on NF, which have been proved to be active in acidic media due to their higher corrosion resistance relative to oxides and sulfides.37,38,153 In addition, efforts to develop efficient, stable, and acid-insoluble, non-precious metal alloys as OER and HER electrocatalysts will also be of great value.
5.4 Combination of OER and HER bifunctional electrocatalysts
The efficiency of electrochemical water splitting is determined not only by the OER electrocatalyst but also by the HER activity. Therefore, the development of bifunctional catalysts that are active and stable for both of these reactions is a key factor in enhancing electrochemical water splitting activity via simplifying the overall system design. Integrating the merits of the OER and HER electrocatalysts by fabricating efficient bifunctional OER–HER heterostructures that are capable of binding to both oxygen- and hydrogen-containing intermediates will be of great benefit for improving the activity of overall water splitting. Thus, a thorough full cell evaluation of OER and HER bifunctional electrocatalysts on NF substrates is necessary to advance electrochemical water splitting systems.
