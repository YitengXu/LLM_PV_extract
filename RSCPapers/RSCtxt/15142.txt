    , Accepted 26th October 2017First published on 26th October 2017AbstractIn recent years, the exquisite modulation of the transport of photogenerated electron–hole charge carriers has constituted a long-standing challenge. To this end, herein, a spatially hierarchical single-layer graphene (GR)–wrapped and WO3 nanorods (NRs)–coupled TiO2 nanobelts (TNBs) ternary nano-architecture (TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR), as a conceptual platform, has been progressively designed via a facile and green layer-by-layer assembly strategy based on pronounced electrostatic interaction. It was remarkable to find that the interfacial charge transfer of a TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure can be finely modulated by interfacial architectural engineering, thus contributing to its significantly improved photoredox performance, including photocatalytic oxidation of organic pollutants and reduction of heavy metal ions, in comparison with single and binary counterparts. The construction of highly efficient cascade electron transfer pathways at the interface is responsible for the enhancement in photoactivities of a ternary heterostructure, which is afforded by intimately intercalating WO3 NRs in the interfacial domains of TNBs and GR. In this unique ternary nano-architecture, the WO3 NRs ingredient serves as an efficient interfacial charge transfer mediator and GR serves as an electron transporter and collector to conspicuously trigger a cascade electron relay from TNBs to GR, thereby expediting the efficacious charge transfer, prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and resulting in the significantly enhanced photoredox activities of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR heterostructure. In addition, the predominant active species responsible for the photoredox process were determined and the underlying photocatalytic mechanism was delineated.
1. Introduction
One-dimensional (1D) semiconductor-based photocatalysts have been gaining tremendous attention owing to their unprecedented advantages compared with bulk counterparts, including fast and long-distance electron transport, large specific surface area and pore volume, as well as enhanced light absorption and scattering properties.1,2 More significantly, the efficiency of charge carrier transfer of 1D semiconductors can be markedly improved along the vertical 1D framework, which substantially boosts the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Recent years have witnessed a cornucopia of species in the exploration of 1D semiconductors, such as nanowires, nanotubes and nanobelts, for widespread photocatalytic applications, such as selective organic transformation, CO2 reduction, hydrogen production and environmental remediation.3–6 Among the diverse 1D semiconductors available, titanium oxide (TiO2), as a quintessential wide-band-gap semiconductor, has spawned the most considerable attention, owing to its low toxicity, rich abundance, low-cost and excellent physicochemical stability.7,8 In particular, 1D TiO2 nanostructures growing directly on the conducting substrates (e.g., Ti foil) demonstrate unique merits because they guarantee vertical charge transfer along the 1D nanostructures to the conducting substrate, which remarkably reduces the loss incurred by charge-hopping across the grain boundaries of bulk nanoparticles.9,10 Nevertheless, the photocatalytic applications of 1D TiO2 nanostructures are still limited by the high recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers and the scant number of surface active sites, which generally result in the low quantum efficiency of photocatalytic reactions.11,12 In this regard, it is highly desirable to solve these obstacles to extend the widespread applications of 1D TiO2 nanostructures in the field of photocatalysis.
To this end, various strategies have been developed, including doping with metal or non-metal elements, deposition with precious metals (e.g., Au, Ag, Cu, Pt) and hybridization with second semiconductors or carbon materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphene).13–15 Of particular note, the construction of TiO2-based heterostructures by the rational integration of metal oxides (e.g., Ag2O,16 SnO2,17 ZnO,18 WO3,19) with TiO2 in an appropriate fashion could improve the photocatalytic performances of TiO2 based on their cooperative synergy.20 Among the plentiful semiconductors available, considerable attention has been devoted to tungsten oxide (WO3), due to its relatively narrow bandgap (2.4–2.8 eV), nontoxicity, stable physicochemical properties, resistance to photocorrosion and the high oxidation power of its valence band holes.21,22 However, rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and the low conduction band edge of WO3 are two main obstacles inhibiting its photocatalytic efficiency.23 It is noteworthy that TiO2 and WO3 demonstrate favorable electronic band structure and are able to form a type II band alignment, which implies that photogenerated electrons and holes from both of them can be effectively separated to boost photocatalytic performances. Hitherto, various TiO2/WO3 nanocomposites have been fabricated for a wide range of photocatalytic applications.24–26 Notwithstanding the progress being made in previous work, the rational construction of TiO2/WO3 heterostructures via a facile, green, easily accessible and bottom-up synthetic strategy by which WO3 and TiO2 are intimately and controllably integrated at the nanoscale to combine their respective advantages has not yet been achieved. Moreover, it is worth noting that most of the previous work was principally confined to conventional nanoparticles, nanotubes, or hollow fibers, and the tunable and exquisite assembly of TiO2/WO3 nanocomposites under ambient conditions has scarcely been reported. Furthermore, there has been no report on the rational construction of spatially hierarchical TiO2 nanobelts/WO3 NRs heterostructures by merely tuning the intrinsic surface charge properties of components to create highly efficient photocatalysts.
On the other hand, the successful isolation of single-layer carbon atoms which are tightly packed into a two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb crystal structure (i.e., graphene, GR) triggered tremendous excitement in scientific communities.27–29 Given the integrative properties of GR, including superior electronic conductivity and mobility, theoretically high specific surface area, excellent optical transmittance, and chemical stability, it is not surprising to see the entry of GR into the field of photocatalysis.30–34 The combination of GR with semiconductors is beneficial for highlighting the crucial role of GR in boosting the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, which is the critical step for photocatalytic reactions.35–37 Until now, a myriad of GR-semiconductor nanocomposites have been prepared over the past few years based on the versatile platform of GR,38–40 which inspires us to speculate that GR might further contribute to improving the photocatalytic performances of TiO2/WO3 nanocomposites by expediting the transfer of photoelectrons and, simultaneously, increasing the light absorption for the bandgap photoexcitation of the ingredients (TiO2 and WO3) to play their cooperative synergy. Thus far, there have been very few reports on the preparation of single-layer GR wrapped TiO2/WO3 nanocomposites;41,42 and in all of these, the components were merely randomly integrated, with no controllable modulation of the interfacial architectures. On the other hand, self-assembly techniques on the basis of electrostatic interaction have attracted enormous attention during the past few years and can serve as efficacious alternatives to conventional wet-chemistry approaches in terms of their high efficiency, environmental benignity and reproducibility. Nevertheless, how to harness the progressive self-assembly technique to judiciously design well-defined 1D semiconductor-GR hybridized nanoarchitectures for photocatalysis still constitutes a long-term challenge.
With these motivations, herein, TiO2 nanobelts (TNBs) intimately co-decorated with single-layer GR and WO3 nanorods (NRs) (i.e., TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR) have been progressively designed via a simple, facile and green electrostatic layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly approach under ambient conditions. It was remarkable to find that charge transfer at the interface of TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure can be finely modulated by rational interfacial architectural engineering with WO3 NRs closely intercalated in the interfacial region of TNBs and single-layer GR, thereby favoring the construction of an efficient cascade electron transport pathway, improving the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, and leading to significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance in comparison with single and binary counterparts. The underlying origin accounting for the significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure was systematically probed and the predominant active species responsible were unambiguously determined. Based on which, a possible photocatalytic mechanism is presented.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Titanium sheets (50 mm × 20 mm × 0.1 mm, 99.9%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), acetone (C3H6O), ethanol (C2H6O), natural graphite sheets (purity 99.5%), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), nitric acid (HNO3), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%), poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA, 1 mg mL−1, 0.5 M NaCl, Mw ≈ 200000–350000), sodium tungstate dihydrate (Na2WO4·2H2O), sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), potassium persulfate (K2S2O8), ammonium oxalate [(NH4)2C2O4], benzoquinone (C6H4O2), isopropanol (C3H8O), and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Deionized water (DI H2O, Millipore, 18.2 MΩ cm resistivity) was obtained from local sources. All materials were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of TNBs
Synthesis of TNBs on Ti foil referred to a previous work with a slight modification.9,10 Firstly, Ti foil was cut into small pieces (20 mm × 50 mm) and ultra-sonicated in acetone, ethanol, and DI H2O for 10 min, respectively. Subsequently, the treated Ti foils were dipped into 40 mL of 5 M NaOH aqueous solution in a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave which was kept at 200 °C for 24 h. After cooling down naturally to room temperature, the samples were washed with DI H2O several times and dried in a dry cabinet. The samples were then immersed in 1 M HCl aqueous solution for 1 h to replace the Na+ with H+. Finally, the thus-obtained hydrogen titanate nanobelts (i.e., H-titanate nanobelts) were annealed in air at 600 °C for 2 h and the TNBs were thus obtained.
2.3 Synthesis of WO3 NRs
WO3 NRs were prepared via a one-step hydrothermal method.36 Typically, 1.06 g of Na2WO4·2H2O and 0.94 g of NaCl were dissolved in 30 mL of DI water and kept under stirring for 20 min. The pH of the solution was adjusted to be ca. 2 using HCl (3.0 M) aqueous solution and stirred for 3 h. Then, the solution was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the products were cooled to room temperature, centrifuged and washed with DI water. Eventually, the sediment was dried at 60 °C and the WO3 NRs were obtained.
2.4 Preparation of TNBs/WO3 NRs and TNBs/GR binary nanocomposites
The TNBs/WO3 NRs binary nanocomposite was prepared by a simple electrostatic approach. Firstly, the TNBs substrate was vertically dipped into PDDA aqueous solution (1 mg mL−1, 100 mL) for 10 min and then rinsed with DI water for 2 min, followed by drying with a gentle stream of N2, resulting in positively charged TNBs (TNBs+). Subsequently, the thus-obtained positively charged TNBs+ substrate was vertically added into WO3 NRs aqueous solution (0.5 g L−1) and stirred for 2 h. The product was finally washed and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The TNBs/GR binary nanocomposite was prepared in a similar way except that the WO3 NRs aqueous solution was replaced with graphene oxide (GO) aqueous solution. Afterwards, the TNBs/GO precursor nanocomposites were transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel filled with 40 mL of DI H2O and kept at 120 °C for 12 h, giving rise to a TNBs/GR binary nanocomposite.
2.5 LbL assembly of TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary nanocomposite
GO was prepared from natural graphite sheets by a modified Hummers' method,28 which is provided in ESI.† To prepare the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure, the TNBs/WO3 NRs binary nanocomposite was subjected to the same modification with PDDA aqueous solution (1 mg mL−1, 100 mL) and then vertically dipped into 100 mL of GO aqueous solution (0.5 mg mL−1) for 5 h, followed by the same washing and drying treatments. The thus-assembled TNBs/WO3 NRs/GO ternary nanocomposite was completely washed with DI water several times and finally transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel vessel filled with 40 mL of DI H2O and kept at 120 °C for 12 h. The as-prepared TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR nanocomposite was washed thoroughly with DI H2O and dried in an oven at 60 °C.
2.6 Characterization
Zeta potentials (ξ) were measured using dynamic light scattering analysis (Zeta sizer 3000HSA) at room temperature. The crystal phases of the samples were determined by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA with a scan rate of 0.02° per second. Raman spectra were collected on a Renishaw inVia Raman System 1000 with a 532 nm Nd: YAG excitation source at room temperature. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to explore the morphologies of the samples on an FEI Nova NANOSEM 230 spectrophotometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer and HRTEM images were acquired using a JEOL model JEM 2010 EX instrument at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCA Lab250 spectrometer, with all binding energies (BEs) calibrated to the BE of C 1s (284.6 eV). The optical properties of the samples were probed by a Cary 500 UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrophotometer (DRS), in which BaSO4 was employed as the internal reflectance standard. Electrochemical analysis was carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell in which a Pt plate and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as counter and reference electrode, respectively. The as-synthesized samples were directly used as the working electrodes. The electrolyte was composed of 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 6.8). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments were conducted on a Precision PARC workstation; the amplitude of the sinusoidal wave was set at 5 mV and the frequency varied from 100 kHZ to 0.05 HZ. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was probed on a Nicolet Nexus 670 FTIR spectrophotometer at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Electron spin resonance (ESR) signals of the radicals trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) were recorded with a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra for solid samples were investigated on an Edinburgh FL/FS900 spectrophotometer.
2.7 Photocatalytic activity measurements

(a) Photocatalytic oxidation performances. 
The photocatalytic performances of the samples were evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of an organic dye pollutant, e.g., Rhodamine B (RhB) in a liquid-phase under UV irradiation (16 W, λ = 254 nm) under ambient conditions. Sample films with the same area (10 mm × 25 mm) were soaked in 3.0 mL of RhB aqueous solution (5 mg L−1, pH = 7) in a quartz cuvette (10 mm × 10 mm × 30 mm). To reach the equilibrium of adsorption–desorption, the mixtures were kept in the dark for 1 h before irradiation. Afterwards, the samples were placed 3 cm away from the light source. At each irradiation time interval of 20 min, the light absorbance of the reaction solution was measured using a Cary 500 scan UV-vis spectrophotometer. The concentration of RhB was determined by monitoring the peak absorption at 553 nm and the degradation ratio of RhB at each time interval was calculated from the ratio of the light absorbance of the irradiated to the non-irradiated solution. Here, C/C0 is designated as the percentage of degradation during the photocatalytic reaction, where C is the concentration of RhB at each irradiation time interval, while C0 is the initial concentration when the adsorption–desorption equilibrium was achieved. In addition, a series of control experiments with the addition of different radical scavengers (i.e. ammonium oxalate as a scavenger for photogenerated holes, K2S2O8 for photoelectrons, isopropanol for hydroxyl radicals and benzoquinone for superoxide radicals)35,36 for the photocatalytic degradation of aqueous RhB solution under UV irradiation (λ = 254 nm) were performed in an analogous way.


(b) Photocatalytic reduction performances. 
Photoreduction performances were evaluated by reduction of Cr(VI) under ambient conditions. In a typical reaction, 20 mg of the sample was dispersed in 30 mL of Cr(VI) aqueous solution (K2Cr2O7, 5 ppm). The mixed suspensions were stirred in the dark for 1 h to ensure the adsorption–desorption equilibrium of catalysts and reactant. The mixed suspension was irradiated with simulated solar radiation (16 W, λ = 254 nm), during which 3 mL of the sample solution was withdrawn at intervals of 15 min and centrifuged to remove the catalyst. The filtrates were analyzed by recording the UV-vis spectra of Cr(VI) using a UV-vis/NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). Conversion by the reaction was determined by the following formula:  where C0 is the original concentration of the reactant and C is the concentration of the reactant measured at individual intervals of 30 min after the beginning of the reaction.

3. Results and discussion

Scheme 1 depicts the detailed flowchart for the LbL assembly of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure. Specifically, H-titanate nanobelts were firstly grown on Ti foil via a facile hydrothermal method and TiO2 nanobelts (TNBs) were attained by Na+ exchange followed by calcination. To rapidly and efficiently modify the surface charge of the TNBs substrate under ambient conditions, TNBs were treated with PDDA, which has been frequently utilized as a positively charged polyelectrolyte, thus affording the formation of a positively charged surface on the TNBs substrate. In this regard, attracted by the substantial electrostatic attractive force, intrinsically negatively charged WO3 NRs (Fig. S1b†) are able to spontaneously and homogeneously self-assemble on the PDDA-modified positively charged TNBs framework to produce a TNBs/WO3 NRs binary nanocomposite. Thereafter, in a similar way, an intrinsically negatively charged GO (Fig. S1a†) precursor was deposited on the PDDA-treated positively charged TNBs/WO3 NRs scaffold, giving rise to a TNBs/WO3 NRs/GO ternary nanocomposite. Finally, TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR was obtained by a facile hydrothermal reduction treatment. In such a successive LbL assembly strategy, tailor-made WO3 NRs and a GO precursor are utilized as the building blocks and an ultra-thin PDDA layer is used as a glue molecule.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the electrostatic LbL assembly of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure. 
Our work begins with the structural characterizations of the samples. Crystal structures were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As displayed in Fig. 1a, the dominant peaks at 2θ values of 25.3, 36.9, 37.8, 38.6, 48.0, 53.9 and 62.7 can be accurately indexed to the (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105) and (204) crystallographic planes of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272).43,44 With regard to the XRD pattern of the TNBs/WO3 NRs binary nanocomposite (Fig. 1b), the peaks at 22.7 and 28.2 corresponding to the (001) and (200) crystallographic planes of hexagonal-phase WO3 (JCPDS no. 33-1387, Fig. S2†) were clearly observed, indicative of the successful assembly of WO3 NRs on the TNBs matrix. However, these two peaks were not observed in the XRD pattern of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary nanocomposite (Fig. 1d), which is predominantly due to the low loading amount of WO3 in the interfacial region of the ternary heterostructure and, probably, these diffraction peaks are shielded by the pronounced diffraction peaks of the TNBs substrate. Yet, the attachment of WO3 NRs in the ternary nanocomposite is verified by the following XPS result (Fig. 3d). Moreover, it should be emphasized that no characteristic peaks of GR can be seen in the XRD patterns of the TNBs/GR binary and TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructures and this can also be attributed to the relatively weak peak intensity of GR in comparison with the dominant peaks of TNBs and, probably, due to the disappearance of layer-stacking regularity after GO reduction.31,32 However, successful integration of GR into the nanocomposites is evidenced by the following Raman result (Fig. 2bIV). For specific comparison, the XRD patterns of pristine WO3, and GO and GR are provided in Fig. S2 and S3,† respectively.

Raman spectra are utilized to analyze the ordered/disordered crystalline structures of carbon-containing materials. It has been well established that the G band is assigned to the first-order scattering of the E2g mode for sp2 carbon domains and the D band is associated with disordered structural defects, e.g., amorphous carbon or edges that can break the symmetry and selection rule.45 As displayed in Fig. 2a, three distinct Raman peaks at 399 (B1g), 517 (A1g + B1g) and 639 cm−1 (Eg) were apparently observed for all samples, which can be assigned to the anatase TiO2 substrate.46 More specifically, the Raman spectra of the TNBs/GR binary and TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructures concurrently exhibit three peaks at ca. 1350, 1600 and 2700 cm−1, which correspond to the D, G and 2D bands,39 indicating that GR nanosheets (NS) have been successfully integrated into the binary and ternary heterostructures. Alternatively, it has been well established that the peak intensity ratio of the D and G bands, i.e., ID/IG, is a measure of the relative concentration of local defects or disorders (particularly the sp3 hybridized defects) in comparison with sp2 hybridized GR domains in carbon-containing nanomaterials.31,47,48 As shown in Fig. 2b, compared with graphite (GP), the presence of D and G bands in the Raman spectra of GO, and the TNBs/GR binary and TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary nanocomposites ascertains the complete exfoliation of GP in GO and hybridized nanocomposites. Note that the ID/IG ratio of GO was 1.04 but it decreased to 0.94 and 1.00 for TNBs/GR and TNBs/WO3/GR, indicating the relatively lower defect density of GR in the binary and ternary nanocomposites compared to GO.
The surface composition and elemental chemical states of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As displayed in Fig. 3a, the survey spectrum of TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR reflects the co-existence of C, O, N, Ti, and W core-elements in the ternary heterostructure, for which the Ti and W elements arise from TNBs and WO3 NRs and N from PDDA. Fig. 3b shows the high-resolution N 1s spectrum, which can be deconvoluted to three peaks at 399.3, 400.2, and 402.2 eV, attributable to the –NH2 functional group, N–C, and N–O bond from PDDA intercalated in the interfacial region, respectively. Note that the peak intensity of N 1s (Fig. 3b) is very weak in comparison with other elements, indicative of only a rather thin PDDA layer being electrostatically assembled on the TNBs matrix.49 As displayed in Fig. 3c, the high-resolution O 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted to two peaks with binding energies (BE) of 530 and 531.85 eV corresponding to the lattice oxygens from (Ti–O) TNBs and (W–O) WO3 NRs, and hydroxyl groups,50 respectively. As unveiled by the high-resolution spectrum of W 4f (Fig. 3d), two pronounced peaks at 35.53 and 37.46 eV corresponding to W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 signify that W is in the +6 oxidation state.36 It is noteworthy that a small doublet at 36.34 and 38.40 eV for W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 can be ascribed to the formation of some defects on the surface.36 A high-resolution spectrum of Ti 2p (Fig. 3e) exhibits two typical peaks at 458.86 and 464.59 eV, pointing to the oxidation state of Ti4+ in the TiO2 scaffold.51 Compared with the high-resolution W 4f and Ti 2p spectra of pristine WO3 NRs (Fig. S4a†) and TNBs (Fig. S4b†), it is apparent that the chemical states of Ti and W elements in the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure were not altered during the LbL assembly. Notably, before reduction, a high-resolution C 1s spectrum of GO (Fig. S5a†) can be fitted to four peaks at 284.4, 286.4, 287.9, and 288.9 eV corresponding to the oxygen-containing functional groups, including CC/C–C (aromatic ring), C–O–C/C–OH (epoxy and hydroxyl), CO (carbonyl), and OC–OH (carboxyl) groups,52,53 respectively. After chemical reduction via hydrothermal treatment, the peak intensity of these oxygen-containing functional groups conspicuously decreases and, simultaneously, the peak intensity of sp2 hybridized carbon increases (Fig. S5b†), implying that the GO assembled in the ternary heterostructure has been completely reduced to GR. Hydrothermal treatment is an essential step to restore the excellent electronic conductivity and mobility of GR for transferring photoelectrons.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was employed to uncover the specific structural features of the self-assembled heterostructures. Fig. S6c† shows the presence of the stretching vibration modes of CO (1730 cm−1), CC (1633 cm−1), C–O–H (1350 cm−1), C–OH (1226 cm−1), and C–O–C (1058 cm−1) species in GO, which stem from the oxygen-containing functional groups on the planar surface of GO.33 Most of these characteristic peaks disappear in the FTIR spectrum of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR heterostructure (Fig. S6b†), which indicates the successful reduction of GO to GR after hydrothermal reduction treatment. This observation is in agreement with the high-resolution C 1s spectra of GO and the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR heterostructure (Fig. S5†). In addition, two peaks at 2976 and 2884 cm−1 were clearly seen and can be attributed to the stretching vibration mode of –CH2 stemming from PDDA, strongly evidencing the progressive assembly with the aid of a PDDA layer in the ternary heterostructure during the LbL self-assembly.37 In addition, typical peaks at 3382 and 1633 cm−1 corresponding to the stretching vibration mode of surface –OH (Ti–OH) and asymmetric vibration mode of Ti–O from the TiO2 scaffold were also identified in the FTIR spectra of pristine TNBs and TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR (Fig. S6a & b†).18 Alternatively, the peaks at 828 and 1044 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibration mode of W–O–W from WO3. Based on the above analysis, FTIR results substantiate the successful incorporation of tailor-made assembly units (i.e., GR, WO3 NRs and TNBs) in the final LbL-assembled nano-architecture.
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was harnessed to intuitively probe the morphologies of the samples. As shown in Fig. S8a,† the TNBs matrix exhibits a uniform nanobelt structure with a smooth surface and possesses thicknesses of 20–40 nm, width of 200–400 nm and length up to dozens of micrometers. FESEM images in Fig. S7† show that WO3 NRs demonstrate a mean size of ca. 50 nm with a length of several micrometers. As displayed in the FESEM image of the TNBs/WO3 NRs binary nanocomposite (Fig. 4a), WO3 NRs were closely deposited on the TNBs surface as marked by the white arrows, indicative of the electrostatic assembly of WO3 NRs on the TNBs. Fig. 4b demonstrates the FESEM image of the TNBs/GR binary nanocomposite in which the TNBs framework was uniformly and intimately wrapped by GR NS in an appropriate “face-to-face” stacking way, as marked by the white arrows, suggesting efficacious assembly of GR NS on the surface modified-TNBs under pronounced electrostatic interaction. For comparison, highly-magnified FESEM images of the TNBs matrix, TNBs/WO3 NRs and TNBs/GR binary heterostructures are displayed in Fig. S8.†Fig. 4c manifests the morphology of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure, from which it can clearly be seen that GR NS were tightly integrated with TNBs and WO3 NRs, forming a well-defined ternary nanoarchitecture. As a result, FESEM results suggest that WO3 NRs and GR building blocks were progressively self-assembled on the TNBs based on electrostatic interaction. The characterizations of the GO precursor are provided in Fig. S9.†

Transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis was carried out to gain more detailed microscopic morphologies and structural information for the nanomaterials. Fig. 4d shows the TEM image of the TNBs substrate, which exhibits a flat surface with a horizontal size of ca. 300 nm and this is in accordance with the FESEM result (Fig. S8a†). As displayed in Fig. 4e, the WO3 NRs are composed of a large bundle of nanorods with a width of 30 nm and a length of 250 nm. As revealed by the TEM images of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure in Fig. 4(f and g) and S10,† the TNBs substrate was closely enwrapped by GR and WO3 NRs, forming a GR wrapped and WO3 NRs coupled ternary heterostructure. This is further evident from the HRTEM image (Fig. 4h), in which the assembled units form a good interfacial contact and the lattice fringes in the designated area are determined to be ca. 0.35 and 0.39 nm, corresponding to the (101) and (111) crystal facets of TiO2 and WO3, respectively. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis (Fig. 4i) verified the co-existence of Ti, O, W, N and C elements in the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure which is consistent with the XPS results (Fig. 3).
UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was utilized to probe the optical properties of different samples. As shown in Fig. 5a, an obvious absorption peak is observed in the wavelength region ranging from 200 to 400 nm for all samples, which is attributed to the bandgap photoexcitation of electrons from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) of the TiO2 matrix.54 The plots obtained based on the transformed Kubelka–Munk function vs. the energy of light are provided in Fig. 5b, from which the bandgap values (Eg) of TNBs, TNBs/WO3 NRs, and TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR were roughly determined to be ca. 3.34, 3.32, and 3.26 eV, respectively. This suggests that the incorporation of WO3 NRs and GR with TNBs did not exert a pronounced influence on the absorption band edge of the nanocomposites, all of which are confined in the UV region.

Photocatalytic performances were evaluated by liquid-phase degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) aqueous solution, a typical organic dye pollutant, under UV light irradiation under ambient conditions. Blank experiments in the dark and without a catalyst showed a limited change in RhB concentration, thus verifying that the degradation reaction was truly driven by a photocatalytic process. Fig. 6a shows the photocatalytic performances of different samples, which follow the order of: TNBs < TNBs/GR < TNBs/WO3 NRs < TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR. Notably, TNBs/GR binary nanocomposites demonstrated improved photoactivity compared with pristine TNBs, which is principally due to the vital role of GR as an electron transporter and collector in improving the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes over TNBs under light irradiation. Similarly, the photocatalytic performance of pristine TNBs was also enhanced when they were combined with WO3 NRs, which is attributable to the formation of favorable type II band alignment between WO3 and TiO2, thereby boosting the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and thus enhancing the photocatalytic performance of the TNBs/WO3 NRs binary nanocomposite. It should be noted that the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure demonstrated optimal photoactivity among the samples. The substantial photoactivity enhancement is mainly ascribed to the unique integration mode of GR and WO3 NRs with the TNBs framework in an intimate fashion, which facilitates charge carrier transfer. More specifically, the WO3 ingredient plays a pivotal role as an interfacial charge transfer mediator to promote the cascade bandgap-photoexcited electrons flow from TiO2 to GR, hence contributing to the substantially improved separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs over the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary nanocomposite. In this way, the cooperative synergy between GR acting as an efficient electron transporter and collector and the WO3 NRs serving as an interfacial charge transfer mediator concurrently prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, leading to the significantly enhanced photocatalytic performances of the ternary heterostructure. The complete mineralization of dye pollutant over the ternary heterostructure can be strongly evidenced by the change in total organic carbon (TOC) percentage of different catalysts during the photocatalytic process (Fig. S11†), which decreases gradually with irradiation time and agrees well with the photocatalytic performances. Photostability has been deemed to be an important factor of photocatalysts for practical application. In this regard, cyclic photodegradation experiments were carried out to evaluate the stability of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure. As shown in Fig. 6b, the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure demonstrated relatively good photostability, with no obvious decay in photoactivity even after four successive cyclic reactions. High-resolution Ti 2p (Fig. 6c), W 3d (Fig. 6d) and N 1s (Fig. S13†) spectra of TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR before and after the cyclic reactions suggest that the chemical states of Ti and W elements were retained, verifying the favorable photostability of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure. Moreover, consistently, XRD (Fig. 6e), Raman (Fig. 6f) and survey XPS results (Fig. S12†) of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure before and after cyclic reactions revealed the intact crystal structures of the TNBs and WO3 NRs components in the ternary heterostructure.

Apart from the photocatalytic oxidation reaction, the photoreduction performances of different samples were also investigated. As shown in Fig. 7a, consistently, the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure demonstrated the optimal photocatalytic performance toward the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ under UV light irradiation under ambient conditions in comparison with the corresponding single and binary counterparts under the same conditions, and they follow the order of: TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR > TNBs/WO3 NRs > TNBs/GR > TNBs, which agrees well with their photo-oxidation performances. Moreover, it is worth noting that the photoreduction performances of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure had not decayed even after five successive reactions (Fig. 7b), strongly suggesting its favorable photostability. Control experiments with and without utilizing K2S2O8 as an electron scavenger confirmed that the photoreduction reaction of Cr6+ was truly driven by photoelectrons (Fig. 7c). Consequently, the results indicated that the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure demonstrated versatile and promising photoredox catalytic performance toward the oxidation of organic dye pollutants and the reduction of heavy metal ions under ambient conditions.

To probe the fate of photogenerated electron–hole charge carriers, photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements were conducted. It has been well established that a photocurrent is normally generated from the diffusion of photogenerated electrons to the back contact and, simultaneously, photoinduced holes are captured by the electron donor in the electrolyte.55,56 As shown in Fig. 8a, it is obvious that the on–off transient photocurrent responses of all samples under UV light irradiation showed no decay in photocurrent and the result manifests the good stability of the catalysts. Apparently, the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure demonstrated the most significantly enhanced photocurrent response in comparison with single and binary counterparts under the same conditions, strongly revealing the most efficient separation and the longest lifetime of photoexcited electron–hole pairs over the ternary heterostructure. Specifically, photocurrents of the different samples follow the order of: TNBs < TNBs/GR < TNBs/WO3 NRs < TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR, which is consistent with the photoactivity results (Fig. 6a). Fig. 8c demonstrates the photocurrent density vs. applied voltage plots recorded under UV light irradiation. It is obvious that the photocurrent density of the samples increases with the forward bias voltage, indicative of a typical n-type semiconductor.57 Consistently, the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure exhibited the optimal photocurrent within the same designated voltage profile. In addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist measurements under UV light irradiation, as an efficacious tool to probe the efficiency of photo-induced charge carrier transfer in the interfacial region between the working electrode and the electrolyte, were performed.58,59 Normally, the smaller the diameter of the semicircular arc of the Nyquist plots the more efficient the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.56,57Fig. 8b shows that the TNBs/WO3/GR ternary heterostructure displayed the smallest semicircular arc radius among all the samples under UV light irradiation, evidence that it possesses the smallest charge transfer resistance in the interfacial domain and the optimal separation efficiency of photoexcited electron–hole pairs. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that only one arc or semicircle was observed in the EIS Nyquist plots of all samples, indicating that the surface charge transfer process is the dominant step that dictates the photocatalytic reaction.

The amplitude of the sinusoidal wave was set at 10 mV and the frequency varied from 100 kHz to 0.05 Hz for EIS measurements. 
To understand why the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure showed such a significantly enhanced photoactivity enhancement compared with the corresponding single and binary counterparts, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were explored. The PL spectrum has been deemed an efficient tool to explore the fate of photogenerated electron–hole charge carriers.40 As displayed in Fig. 9a, the PL intensity of the TNBs decreased when they were separately integrated with GR or WO3 NRs in the binary nanocomposites and they follow the order of: TNBs > TNBs/GR > TNBs/WO3 NRs. The results suggest that photoexcited electrons produced over TNBs in binary heterostructures can spontaneously flow to GR and WO3 NRs which serve as electron transporter and collector, thereby benefiting the separation and prolonging the life-span of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. More significantly, when TNBs were co-integrated with WO3 NRs and GR via LbL assembly, the PL intensity of TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR was additionally decreased and demonstrated the lowest PL intensity, i.e., TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR < TNBs/WO3 NRs < TNBs/GR < TNBs, indicative of the most efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes over the ternary heterostructure in comparison with single and binary counterparts. Considering the lower work function of GR and the PL results, it can reasonably be speculated that intimately combining TNBs, WO3 NRs and GR building blocks in the ternary heterostructure enables the construction of an efficacious cascade electron transfer pathway which favors the transport of photoelectrons from TNBs to GR via WO3 NRs. The PL results agree well with the photocatalytic and PEC performances.

(b) Control experiments using different radical scavengers toward photocatalytic degradation of RhB over the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure: (I) without adding any radical scavengers (viz., initial), adding (II) ammonium oxalate (AO), (III) benzoquinone (BQ), (IV) isopropanol (Iso) and (V) K2S2O8 as scavengers for capturing photogenerated holes, superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals and photogenerated electrons under UV light irradiation (λ = 254 nm) for 60 min. ESR spectra for detecting (c) DMPO-O2−˙ and (d) DMPO-OH˙ radicals in situ formed in the methanol and aqueous solutions of TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR with and without UV light irradiation (λ = 254 nm). 
On the other hand, with a view to determining the predominant active species responsible for the significantly enhanced photocatalytic performances and revealing the underlying photocatalytic mechanism of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure, a series of control experiments with the addition of different scavengers for quenching various radicals (e.g., hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, holes, and electrons) was performed. As shown in Fig. 9b, when an ammonium oxalate (AO) scavenger for capturing holes and a benzoquinone (BQ) scavenger for superoxide radicals (O2−˙) were added into the reaction system, the photoactivities of TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR were substantially prohibited; however, when an isopropanol (Iso) scavenger for quenching hydroxyl radicals (OH˙) and a K2S2O8 scavenger for photoelectrons were added into the reaction system, the photoactivities were not restrained. Based on this, it can be deduced that the dominant active species responsible for the remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure are holes and superoxide radicals. Furthermore, to prove this speculation, electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were carried out to probe the in situ generation of O2−˙ and OH˙ radicals in the reaction system. As shown in Fig. 9c, substantial signals corresponding to O2−˙ radicals were clearly observed in the ESR result of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure under UV light irradiation and no such signals were seen in the dark, which is strong evidence that a large amount of O2−˙ radicals was produced in situ in the reaction system. On the contrary, as displayed in Fig. 9d, no signal attributable to OH˙ radicals was detected in the ESR result of TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR both under UV light irradiation and in the dark, suggesting that no OH˙ radicals were yielded in the reaction system. This is in faithful agreement with the quenching experiment results (Fig. 9b). According to the above results, the primary active species (i.e., O2−˙ radicals and holes) during the photocatalytic process were unambiguously unveiled. In addition, the crucial role of oxygen in promoting the production of active species (i.e., O2−˙ radicals) during the photocatalytic reactions can be evidenced by control experiments by bubbling N2 and O2 gas into the reaction systems while performing the photocatalytic reactions. As reflected in Fig. S14,† the photocatalytic performance of TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR was remarkably restrained when N2 was bubbled into the reaction system; however, the photocatalytic performance was expedited when O2 was bubbled into the system under the same conditions, with the dye pollutant being rapidly and completely degraded. Thus, the results strongly unravel the pivotal role of O2 in boosting the significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure.
Based on the above systematic exploration, a possible photocatalytic mechanism of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure was proposed, as vividly depicted in Scheme 2. Under UV light irradiation, the bandgap photoexcitation of the TNBs (TiO2) substrate and WO3 NRs occur simultaneously, for both of which electrons (e−) are photoexcited from the VB to the corresponding CB, leaving holes (h+) in the VB. Immediately, photoelectrons on the CB of TiO2 are able to spontaneously transfer to the CB of WO3, owing to the more negative CB of TiO2 relative to WO3 (Ef = −0.23 eV vs. NHE) in the nanocomposite (Fig. 10).48 Subsequently, the electrons are instantly captured by GR on account of its lower Fermi level (Ef = −0.08 eV vs. NHE) and rapidly transferred to the O2 dissolved in the reaction system to produce superoxide radicals (O2˙−) which contribute to the complete mineralization of the organic dye pollutant. It is noteworthy that photoelectrons on the GR can reduce O2 to O2˙− radicals with high efficiency, and this has been verified in previous work.60,61

 Fig. 10  Mott–Schottky plot of the WO3 NRs/GR binary heterostructure. 
The spontaneous electron transfer from the CB of WO3 to GR can be verified by their matched energy band alignment. It has been generally believed that the bottom of the CB in many n-type semiconductors is close to the flat-band position and thus the CB position of an n-type semiconductor can be roughly determined by Mott–Schottky measurement to probe the flat-band position.62,63 As shown in Fig. 10, the flat-band potential (Vfb) of the WO3 component was determined by extrapolating the Mott–Schottky plot of the WO3 NRs/GR binary heterostructure to intersect with the X-axis, by which the flat-band potential of WO3 is determined to be ca. −0.43 V vs. Ag/AgCl, i.e., −0.23 V vs. NHE, and obviously it is more negative than the work function of GR (−0.08 V vs. NHE). Notably, the result is in faithful agreement with previous work36 and this strongly indicates that photoelectron transfer from the CB of the WO3 NRs to GR is thermodynamically favorable owing to suitable band alignment.48 As depicted in Scheme 2, it is apparent that the WO3 NRs ingredient plays a crucial role as an efficient interfacial electron transfer mediator with GR as an effective electron collector and transporter in this unique ternary heterostructure. Therefore, the progressive LbL assembly of WO3 NRs and GR on the TNBs scaffold endows the ternary heterostructure with a highly efficient cascade electron transfer highway for expediting photoelectron transport. Meanwhile, photo-induced holes on the VB of WO3 can spontaneously flow to the VB of TNBs (TiO2) owing to the formation of a favorable type II band alignment between them. In the following step, the electrons can combine with O2 to produce highly active O2−˙ radicals and some of the electrons are involved in the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+, given its favorable redox potential (E = +1.33 V). The holes can directly mineralize the organic dye pollutant or oxide H2O/–OH species to hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) which concurrently mineralize the organic dye pollutant. In this way, the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs over WO3 and TNBs (TiO2) was remarkably retarded and the lifetime of these two pairs of charge carriers was substantially prolonged, thereby resulting in significantly enhanced photocatalytic performances of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that intimate interfacial contact among these assembly units in conjunction with their cooperative synergy also contributes to the significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance of the TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure.
4. Conclusions
In summary, an efficient progressive LbL self-assembly strategy has been created to rationally construct a well-defined spatially hierarchical TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure with WO3 NRs closely intercalated in the interfacial domain of TNBs and GR, for which intrinsic surface charge properties of tailor-made WO3 NRs and GR building blocks were judiciously harnessed. Combined with a series of systematic structural characterizations and performance explorations, it was remarkable to reveal that the self-assembled TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR ternary heterostructure exhibited a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance toward the mineralization of organic dye pollutants in comparison with the corresponding single and binary counterparts under UV light irradiation, due primarily to the unique integration mode of the assembly units in an appropriate fashion afforded by LbL assembly, which conspicuously boosted the cascade electron relay and prolonged the lifetime of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. PEC results ascertained the cooperative synergy of WO3 and GR, which serve as efficacious interfacial electron transfer mediator and electron collector, respectively. In addition, O2−˙ radicals and holes are undoubtedly determined to be the primary active species responsible for the substantially enhanced photocatalytic performances of TNBs/WO3 NRs/GR. Finally, a possible photocatalytic mechanism and charge transfer pathway were delineated. It is anticipated that our work will open new avenues for the construction of diverse 1D TiO2-based heterostructures via rational interfacial architectural engineering toward versatile photocatalytic applications.
