    , Accepted 23rd September 2010First published on 29th November 2010AbstractThe present review rationalizes the information spread in the literature concerning the use and role of buffer layers in polymer solar cells. Usual device structures include buffer layers, both at the anode and at the cathode interface, mainly to favour charge collection and extraction, but also to improve the device’s overall performance. Buffer layers are actually essential for achieving highly efficient polymer solar cells and can no more be considered as “optional”, thus the need and importance of understanding their properties and role. The aim of this review is to give the reader an overview of this topic and to provide a practical and useful tool for the daily activities of researchers in the field of polymer photovoltaics.

Broader context
The global increase in energy demand together with the concern for climate change, have triggered the interest in renewable energies and, in particular, for low-cost photovoltaic technologies, which could be really competitive with existing ones. Polymer photovoltaics seems to be a promising candidate for contributing to overcome the challenges set by global demands. Indeed this emerging technology offers the prospect of low cost of active materials, low energy input and easy upscaling. This last potential advantage is given by the possibility of printing the active layer, thereby greatly boosting production throughputs, compared to other thin-film photovoltaic technologies. Especially in the last decade, polymer solar cells have attracted scientific and economic interest due to the steep increase in power conversion efficiency. This was achieved by the combination of improved material engineering and fine control of the active layer nanoscale morphology, and by the use of more sophisticated device structures. Indeed, each part of the cell architecture greatly affects the device performance, including the choice and properties of the electrode buffer layers, used both at the anode and cathode interfaces.

1. Introduction
Thanks to the simple but great idea of the so-called bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) concept1,2 for the active layer of polymer solar cells,3 the first commercial “plastic” photovoltaic panels are going to be introduced to the market.4 In a BHJ solar cell, a bi-continuous composite of an electron-acceptor (A) and an electron-donor (D) material is formed at the nanoscale, thus maximizing the interfacial D/A area. In the ideal case, every exciton photogenerated throughout the bulk of the photoactive layer can reach the D/A interface within a diffusion length, that is, before decaying. The offsets of molecular orbital energy levels (highest occupied molecular orbital, HOMO, and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, LUMO) of the D/A pair provide the driving force to overcome the exciton binding energy (around 0.3–0.5 eV)5 and photogenerated excitons dissociate into free carriers by photoinduced charge transfer.6 The BHJ morphology provides continuous pathways to the device electrodes for efficient collection of both positive and negative carriers. In a few words, the bulk-hetrojunction approach for the active layer of polymer solar cells currently represents the most appropriate answer to the limited diffusion length of excitons in organic materials (around 10–20 nm).7 Last but not least, the great advantage of BHJ solar cells is the ability to process the composite active layer from solution in a single step, in full compatibility with cheap roll-to-roll processing techniques.
The fundamental electronic interactions between the donor and the acceptor material are essential for the efficient dissociation of photogenerated excitons into free carriers. Fullerene derivatives have been the electron-acceptor components in state-of-the-art performing polymer solar cells since 1995,8 while π-conjugated polymers act as electron-donors and the main absorbers, given the poor optical absorption of fullerene in the visible range of the spectrum. Indeed, ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer occurs in a number of conjugated polymer/fullerene pairs, with a quantum efficiency for charge separation close to 100%.9Fullerene is a very special molecule because of its high symmetry, and exhibits special properties (very high electron-affinity;10 ability to stabilize negative charge;11 very high electron mobility12), making some of its soluble derivatives the best electron-acceptors currently available for polymer photovoltaics.3 In particular, [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methylester13 (PCBM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methylester14 (PC70BM) are still employed in most efficient polymer solar cells.

Thiophene, fluorene and carbazole copolymers are currently the main classes of electron-donors.15–17 For many years, polymer solar cells showing the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) have been made of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as donor, reaching PCE of around 5%.18 The performance of P3HT:PCBM solar cells is mainly limited by (i) the rather high energy gap of the polymer (around 2.0 eV), limiting its harvesting ability of solar light, and by (ii) the non-optimized electronic properties of the D/A pair. It has indeed been shown that, in principle, efficiency of up to 10% (estimated by assuming a fill factor and an average external quantum efficiency of 0.65) can be achieved for polymer:PCBM solar cells, through the molecular design of conjugated polymers with optimized energy levels.19 The fine tuning of the energy levels of donor polymers is currently the main approach in the design of novel active materials for highly efficient polymer solar cells. Indeed, the energy levels of the donor polymer or their position with respect to those of the fullerene derivative have an effect on: (i) the energy range of harvested photons; (ii) the driving force to overcome the binding energy of the photogenerated excitons; (iii) the thermodynamic limit of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) exhibited by related solar cells.20 Following the approach of the energy level engineering, novel donor materials with enhanced electronic properties have been prepared,15–17 leading to solar cell efficiencies exceeding 7%,21 that is not so far from the predicted value of 10%.
The new millennium has seen a rapid progression of the performance of polymer solar cells,22 not only due to the utilization of more suitable electron-donor materials, with respect to the past, but mainly triggered by the fine control over the nanoscale morphology of the interpenetrating polymer:fullerene network. Indeed, most research activities of the last decade have been devoted to the development of suitable protocols for the achievement of an optimum morphology of the mixed active layer. For a given D/A pair, the optimum morphology is that providing the best trade-off between high generation of free carriers and good transport properties for both positive and negative carriers through the donor and the acceptor phase, respectively. Depending on the D/A pair, different approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving the morphology of solution-deposited polymer:fullerene active layers: thermal treatments,18,23,24solvent treatments25–27 and processing with suitable additives.28–30 All of them induce impressive variations of the active layer morphology,31 as well as enhanced optical26,32 and transport properties,25,27 and lead to consistent improvement of the overall power conversion efficiency of the related solar cells.
Conventional polymer solar cells are illuminated through the anode electrode, collecting and extracting positive carriers, usually provided by a transparent conductive oxide onto a transparent substrate, indium-tin oxide (ITO) on a glass substrate in most cases. The top electrode, acting as the cathode, is made of an opaque metal layer, usually aluminium. Over the years, the opposite device structure, the inverted structure, has been established for polymer solar cells. In an inverted solar cells, the bottom transparent substrate/electrode serves as the cathode whereas the top electrode is the anode. Inverted polymer solar cells,33 showing power conversion efficiency comparable to those exhibited by conventional solar cells,34,35 present two main advantages: (i) they often exhibit higher environmental stability with respect to the conventional structure; (ii) they provide higher flexibility in the design of multi-junction or tandem polymer solar cells.36 Tandem solar cells are more complex device structures in which two individual sub-cells with different bandgaps are stacked and, usually, series-connected. The first cell absorbs the higher-energy portion of the solar spectrum while remaining transparent to the lower-energy photons, which are transmitted to and absorbed by the second one. These selective absorption processes lead to higher total efficiency due to the absorption of a larger portion of the solar spectrum. All solution-processed tandem polymer solar cells have already been demonstrated37 and efficiencies up to 15% have been predicted by theoretical considerations.38
The steep increase of the overall performance of polymer solar cells registered in the last years has been mainly due to the combination of optimized active layer nanoscale morphology and improved electronic properties of the active materials, mainly of the donor component. Manipulation of the D/A composite morphology and the designing rules of novel active materials with enhanced electronic properties have been two major concerns for the development of highly efficient polymer solar cells and much attention has been devoted to them in review papers. However, the performance of a polymer solar cell, and in general of any solar cell, is also affected by the quality of the device electrodes, which contributes substantially to the overall efficiency. The role of the electrodes in a solar cell device is the efficient collection and extraction of charges. For this aim, the structure of polymer solar cells usually includes functional layers at the active layer/electrode interfaces to favour charge collection and extraction. These additional layers, called buffer layers or interfacial layers or interlayers, can no more be considered as “optional”, but are essential for achieving maximum performance in polymer solar cells. So, the usual structures for single-junction polymer solar cells include both an anode buffer layer (ABL) and a cathode buffer layer (CBL), as shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Typical device structures of single-junction conventional and inverted polymer solar cells. ABL: anode buffer layer; CBL: cathode buffer layer. 
A number of electrode buffer layers have first been established for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and later on have been transferred to polymer solar cells. They can strongly affect the properties of the organic/electrode interface by inducing interfacial charge redistributions, geometry modifications, and/or chemical reactions; in other words, buffer materials can be used to “engineer” the active layer/electrode interfaces.39Electrode buffer layers are mainly selected on the basis of their energy levels and charge transport properties. However, they can also serve as “protection” against the roughness of the substrate or the diffusion of the top electrode through the active layer, and can even act as oxygen and water scavengers. Moreover, in some cases they can enable better light absorption, leading to enhanced efficiencies, thus having the additional role of “optical spacer”. Finally, electrode buffer layers are necessary for reversing the cell polarity,39 glass/ITO being commonly used as a substrate also in the inverted device configuration. In this paper the crucial role of electrode buffer layers for the overall performance of polymer solar cells as well as the variety of their effects are reviewed. Interlayers in tandem solar cells have been reviewed elsewhere36 and will not be discussed here.
2. 
        Anode buffer layers
The role of an anode buffer layer is the improvement of the anode electrode efficiency in collecting and extracting positive carriers.

Polymer solar cells are commonly realized onto ITO-coated substrates, both in conventional and in inverted architectures. The work function of ITO is usually reported at around 4.7 eV,40 thus not aligned either with the HOMO level of most common donor polymers, or with the LUMO of fullerenes. The non-ohmic character of the ITO/donor or ITO/acceptor interface affects the maximum attainable open-circuit voltage in conventional and inverted solar cells,41Voc being governed by the energy levels of the donor and acceptor materials in case of ohmic contacts.20 Concerning the contact selectivity necessary to suppress leaking currents and to improve the diode rectification ratio, ITO is in principle able to collect both positive and negative carriers, again because of the position of its work function with respect to the typical energy levels of the active materials, thus it cannot provide the required selectivity. Summarizing, the main requirements for an anode buffer layer are:
1. it has to provide an ohmic contact with the donor material;
2. it has to transport positive carriers efficiently (hole transporting);
3. it has to select positive carriers, thus it has to block negative carriers (electron blocking).
In addition, the ideal anode buffer layer should be stable and should not increase the device series resistance (Rs). Finally, transparency is required in the conventional device configuration.
2.1 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxithiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid)
The performance improvement of a conventional polymer solar cell by the use of an anode buffer layer was first reported in the late 1990s, when, following the example of a similar successful experimentation in the field of OLEDs,42 a suited conducting polymer was included in the cell architecture.43 The authors showed that the ABL, consisting of a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxithiophene) (PEDOT) doped with poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PSS), was advantageous for the device because it improved the hole-collection properties of the ITO bottom contact, as compared to the device without the ABL.
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxithiophene) was developed in the second half of the 1980s in the research laboratories of Bayer AG (Germany). An exhaustive description of its synthesis and derivatives, together with a review of its many interesting properties, can be found in ref. 44 and 45. PEDOT's advantage over other well performing conjugated polymers resides in its molecular structure, which confers on it very low toxicity. Moreover, its insolubility (a common limiting issue among these polymers) has been overcome by performing chemical polymerization of ethylene-3,4-dioxythiophene in the presence of PSS aqueous polyelectrolyte, yielding a colloidal PEDOT:PSS dispersion suited for aqueous processing. PEDOT:PSS is now commercially available in several forms of water dispersion on multi-ton scale from H.C. Starck (Leverkusen, Germany) under the trade name of Clevios (formerly Baytron), offering a wide choice of properties, among which the most relevant is probably electrical conductivity. A comparison of P3HT:PCBM solar cells prepared with different kinds of PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layers46 is reported in Table 1, where the beneficial effects of the ABL conductivity on the short-circuit current (Jsc) as well as on the fill factor (FF) are clearly shown.

Since the late 1990s and without any doubt, PEDOT:PSS has been the most widely used anode buffer layer in conventional cell architecture, though solvent-treated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxithiophene) (undoped) ABLs, showing high electrical conductivity, have also been demonstrated and successfully applied to polymer solar cells.47 The PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersion seems to contain all the necessary ingredients in the right combination for a profitable use in polymer solar cells, as recently observed by Irwin et al.48 Firstly, it has sufficient optical transparency in the visible range. Secondly, it is effective in transporting holes and blocking negative carriers to the anode. Thirdly, its high work function (usually reported between 4.8 and 5.2 eV)45 allows the formation of an ohmic contact with most common donor polymers, and finally it is stable enough in ambient conditions.
The advantages of the use of PEDOT:PSS ABL in polymer solar cells are evidenced by several studies. The importance of an ohmic contact to avoid energy barriers at the ITO interface is evidenced, for example, by Liet al.49 As they showed for P3HT:PCBM conventional solar cells, all the photovoltaic parameters can be improved by including a PEDOT:PSS interlayer at the ITO/active layer interface. Several authors have also underlined the importance of PEDOT:PSS layer in the planarization of ITO superficial spikes.50–52 In other cases the beneficial effect of PEDOT:PSS on Voc was addressed and explained,53–55 while the improved hole collection is treated, for example, in ref. 56. Concerning the PEDOT:PSS layer thickness, in 2009 Kim et al.57 proposed rationalization of the effects of this parameter on cell performance, by conducting a systematic investigation. They concluded that Jsc was the only affected parameter in the explored range of thickness (60–165 nm), the short-circuit current slightly decreasing with increasing the thickness of the ABL. In general, excellent results can be obtained by tuning both the conductivity and the thickness of PEDOT:PSS buffer layer.58
On the other hand, it is also true that PEDOT:PSS has some negative implications due to: (i) the extreme acidity of its dispersion (pH ∼ 1÷2), causing indium loss from the ITO contact; (ii) the presence of water, both from the dispersion and from humidity uptake from the ambient (PEDOT:PSS is highly hygroscopic); (iii) the difficult reproducibility of PEDOT:PSS interlayer morphology. The disadvantages of PEDOT:PSS related to its acidic pH, leading to ITO corrosion, have been confirmed by the numerous studies performed on this subject.59–68 A quite relevant work has also been carried out on the morphology implications of PEDOT:PSS layers,64,67 as well as on the role of PEDOT:PSS on device degradation.69–71 Concerning the PEDOT:PSS selectivity as ABL, some authors stated that it has limited electron-blocking properties, as compared to other kinds of materials.60,68,72–74 Indeed, the work function of PEDOT:PSS is highly influenced by the layer's water content75 and can be tuned in several ways.35,76
Many different attempts have been reported to improve the different commercially available formulations of PEDOT:PSS. Although the majority of these studies have been focused on the properties of the bare film deposited onto different substrates (silicon wafers, glass or ITO) or on the effects in OLEDs, most of the results can be transferred to polymer solar cells. Two classes of treatments can be distinguished: those based on physical treatments, and those involving chemical additives. In the next section the ones applied in polymer solar cells fabrication will be described.
2.2 Treatments of PEDOT:PSS

Physical treatments. 
The physical treatments that have been proposed up to date can be classified in three different groups: (i) thermal; (ii) UV light; (iii) plasma treatments. The first and simplest physical treatment is a thermal treatment. Kim et al.57 showed that PEDOT:PSS interlayers, deposited between ITO and the active layer of P3HT:PCBM conventional solar cells, caused major effects on Jsc, upon being subjected to 15 min annealing treatments in the 75–230 °C temperature range. They suggested that the improved performance was a probable consequence of variations induced on PEDOT:PSS work function (also reported by Huang et al.),77 on its electrical conductivity (mainly in the normal direction with respect to the substrate), and on its surface roughness, related to variations in the vertical distribution of PSS moiety. A non-adiabatic annealing has recently been proposed, by Schaarsmidt et al.78 The rapid thermal annealing they performed on a previously baked PEDOT:PSS film (120 °C, 3 min) consisted in heating the sample in an inert argon atmosphere up to temperatures of 200–300 °C, in intervals of 20 °C, for a duration of 300 s and with a ramp time of 15 s. Although they did not build a device with their treated PEDOT:PSS layers, they suggested that the proposed treatment can represent an attractive route for modulating and enhancing the properties of PEDOT:PSS anode buffer layers, as they observed an increased doping level of PEDOT with no indication of oxidative degradation in the investigated temperature range.
A different and interesting approach to physical treatments was reported by Lee et al.,79 consisting in irradiating PEDOT:PSS buffer layers with UV light. Although a long exposure of PEDOT to UV light (of the order of 102 h) can cause its degradation, with a reduction of its electrical conductivity,80 due to reactions with oxygen or air, a relatively short UV treatment has been proved beneficial for the performance of the related polymer solar cells79 (Fig. 2). The authors proposed this technique as a cost-effective and simple method compared to other approaches for improving the PEDOT:PSS ABL properties. After a short thermal annealing (5 min at 200 °C), the PEDOT:PSS layer was subjected to UV irradiation (365 nm, 544 μW cm−2). The optimum exposure time was found to be 40–60 min, leading to the best performance of the related solar cells (Fig. 2). The UV treatment did not damage PEDOT:PSS and increased its work function, thus improving the ohmic contact with the donor phase. The main advantage over other methods resides in the highly reproducible character of the UV treatment and the possibility of easily including it as a supplementary step in a continuous production process. A similar treatment, based on UV–ozone, has been successfully reported for OLED devices,81 but not tested in solar cells.

Ar or O2 mild plasma-treated PEDOT:PSS ABLs led to improved hole collection and fill factor in solar cells made of low-molecular-weight materials,50 as well as to improved conductivity and contact area in light emitting devices.82 However, no significant enhanced performance was observed when O2 plasma-treated PEDOT:PSS were used as ABL in P3HT:PCBM bulk-heterojunction solar cells.83


Additives. 
A considerable variety of additives have been tested and reported in the literature to improve the properties of PEDOT:PSS ABL. They can be classified, based on their chemical nature, in: (i) polyalcohols (mainly sorbitol, a solid, and glycerol, a highly viscous liquid); (ii) nanosized materials (i.e.graphene, metal nanoparticles).

Sorbitol has been used as an additive to increase the electric conductivity of PEDOT:PSS buffer layer of polymer solar cells.84,85 Devices including a sorbitol-doped ABL were compared with those made with an unmodified PEDOT:PSS dispersion and higher Jsc, but lower Voc were reported in the case of the doped interlayer.84
Another polyalcohol, glycerol, has been widely used as an additive of PEDOT:PSS. The conductivity of PEDOT:PSS was systematically changed by glycerol addition (up to 10% by weight) to the water dispersion, and its effect on P3HT:PC70BM solar cells including the modified ABLs was investigated.86 The glycerol content affected Jsc (increasing with the doping and indicating lowering of the device series resistance) while the effect on FF was the opposite. An enhanced PCE was observed for 6% by weight of glycerol addition. A further study, performed on P3HT:PCBM solar cells,87 showed results in the same direction: enhanced PEDOT:PSS conductivity and solar cells performance, due to a reduced Rs. However, high glycerol concentrations (> 30 g l−1) increased the roughness of PEDOT:PSS ABL and no further improvements were observed for the related devices. An exhaustive study of the effect of PEDOT:PSS glycerol doping, as a way to improve the performance of polymer solar cells, is reported in ref. 88. By changing the glycerol content up to 40% by weight, the authors correlated the device efficiency with the interlayer conductivity, its work function, surface morphology and contact properties. The optimum glycerol concentration was found to be around 25–35% (Fig. 3), leading to a maximum PCE of 3.3% for P3HT:PCBM solar cells, as compared to devices with PEDOT:PSS ABL with no addition of glycerol (PCE 2.5%). Also from this study, Jsc shows to be the most enhanced parameter by the glycerol addition, attributed to the increased effective contact interfacial area with the active layer. This, together with the increase in conductivity, may enhance the hole transport ability. On the other hand, FF resulted in being significantly reduced, probably due to a decreased device shunt resistance (Rsh), attributed to a higher leakage current caused by the enhanced roughness of the glycerol-doped PEDOT:PSS surface.
 Fig. 3  Percentage variation of the photovoltaic parameters of ITO/PEDOT:PSS:glycerol/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al solar cells upon the modification of the PEDOT:PSS ABL with different weight percentages of glycerol. Data were extracted from ref. 88. 
The role of additives, glycerol and ethylene glycol buthyl ether (EGBE) surfactant, in ink-jet printed PEDOT:PSS layers has also been explored,89 as well as their effect on P3HT:PCBM solar cells. Indeed, depending on the layer deposition technique, the presence and the role of additives can be determining for the processability of PEDOT:PSS dispersion, so their choice is not trivial as the processing conditions must go along with satisfactory device performance. The best performance was obtained for a device with an ABL containing 6% glycerol and 0.2% EGBE, resulting in the best uniformity of the film thickness.
An original approach was the addition of gold nanoparticles (NPs) into the PEDOT:PSS ABL of P3HT:PCBM solar cells.90 The enhanced device performance including the modified ABL was attributed to a plasmonic effect, increasing the exciton generation rate and the probability of exciton dissociation. Enhanced Jsc and FF were observed, with respect to devices including a pristine PEDOT:PSS ABL, and a maximum PCE of 4.19% was achieved with a concentration of Au NPs of 20%.
A promising approach has been very recently proposed for the improvement of PEDOT:PSS as ABL. Hydrophilic graphene oxide (GO) was used as an additive of PEDOT:PSS91 in P3HT:PCBM solar cells. PCE was enhanced from 2.1 to 2.4% with a GO-doped anode buffer layer, compared to a reference cell made with pristine PEDOT:PSS. The pre-annealing of GO, prior to its addition to the PEDOT:PSS dispersion, led to further significant improvement of the cell performance (Table 2). According to the authors, due to the low price and easy preparation, soluble graphene could be promising as a buffer layer component.

Despite all the studies performed until now, a clear and evident correlation between the properties of PEDOT:PSS ABL and the performance of polymer solar cells is far from being established. Moreover, in spite of the numerous approaches explored to improve PEDOT:PSS dispersion, the scientific community is far from being able to indicate a unique way of treating it in order to get optimal device performances.

          PEDOT:PSS/pentacene ABLs have been proposed in polythiophene/C60 bilayer solar cells92 to block the leaking of electrons to the ITO anode, upon the high temperature treatments required to induce an intermixed D/A morphology. For instance, in a cell made of poly(3-hexyl-2,5-thienylene vinylene) (P3HTV) and C60, Voc raised from 0.26 to 0.66 V upon inserting the pentacene layer, while maintaining fairly good current densities. In P3HT:PCBM solar cells the improvement of PCE determined by a pentacene ABL was nearly 1.7 times.93
A copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) buffer layer increased the efficiency, Voc and FF in poly(3-octylthiophene):PCBM solar cells, behaving similarly to PEDOT:PSS.94 The same studies were carried out also for P3HT:PCBM devices and similar results were obtained.93CuPc has also been used in an inverted solar cell between a top gold anode and a MEH-PPV:PCBM active layer,95 also preventing the diffusion of gold into the active layer. These low molecular weight materials are stable to oxidation, thus the related devices are more resistant to degradation. More recently, CuPc has been proposed in bilayer ABLs, in combination with vanadium oxide.96 Compared to devices with a PEDOT:PSS ABL, better FF but lower Jsc were obtained, leading to similar PCE.
Poly[3,4-(1-hydroxymethyl)ethylenedioxythiophene] (PHEDOT, Fig. 4) is structurally similar to PEDOT, which differs due to the absence of hydroxymethyl groups. The latter are able to interact with the hydroxyl groups located on the ITO surface, thus increasing the adhesion of the buffer layer to the anode. Kim et al.97 prepared ITO/PHEDOT substrates by oxidative polymerization of the corresponding monomer, obtaining highly transparent films (transmittance > 80%). The high conductivity of PHEDOT (700 S cm−1) resulted in a higher Jsc of P3HT:PCBM cells, compared to devices with a PEDOT:PSS ABL, but Voc and FF were lower, likely because of the non optimal properties at the electrode junction. The overall efficiency was found to be lower than in the reference cell (2.67% vs. 3.45%).
 Fig. 4  Molecular structures of selected organic materials used as anode buffer layers. 

          Poly(aniline), in different forms, is one of the most popular polymeric ABL, in addition or in substitution of PEDOT:PSS. Chang et al.98 fabricated a P3HT:PCBM cell using an interfacial layer of n-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid/hydrochloric acid-doped poly(aniline) nanotubes (a-PANIN)s spin coated on top of PEDOT:PSS. The nanotubes had an hollow structure (>12 μm long and 300–600 nm in diameter), forming an ordered semicrystalline layer. The 1-D tubular structure provided at the same time a good contact surface with P3HT:PCBM active layer and an efficient pathway for hole transport. As a result, PCE was higher compared to those observed in a device with PEDOT:PSS alone. These findings were confirmed on other devices based on P3HT with different molecular weight and regioregularity.99
Poly(styrenesulfonic acid)-graft-poly(aniline) PSSA-g-PANI (Fig. 4) is a material with high transmittance in the visible range and high conductivity (0.1 S cm−1). Accordingly, devices based on PSSA-g-PANI buffer layer exhibited a higher Jsc and a PCE about 20% greater than that of a cell with a PEDOT:PSS ABL.100
Bejbouji et al.101 tested several sulfonated poly(aniline) dispersions in different solvent mixtures. Accordingly, poly(aniline)s were spin coated onto ITO-coated substrates and P3HT:PCBM was used as the photoactive layer. The device performances were found to be dependent on various parameters: (i) thinner ABLs (30 nm) behave better than thick ones, as a result of the more efficient charge carrier transport; (ii) water-based s-PANIs in general afforded better devices; (iii) among the organic solvent-based s-PANIs, the tetrahydrofurane/dimethylsulfoxide/ethanol dispersion led to PCE comparable with water-based s-PANIs; (iv) the higher molecular weight sulfonic dopant improved the film forming properties, made the film more transparent, and the solar cell more efficient (2.5% PCE was obtained for non optimized devices). Sulfonated poly(aniline)102,103 and poly(pyrrole)104 were used by other authors in devices made of single-component active layers (poly(3-methylthiophene)).
Another polymer studied by several groups is poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-co-N-(4-(1-methylpropyl)phenyl)diphenylamine] (PFT, Fig. 4). PFT exhibits a high hole mobility, exceeding 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1.105 Park et al.106 were the first to report an improvement in polymer solar cells when using a thin interfacial layer of PFT between PEDOT:PSS and an active layer of MDMO-PPV:PCBM. Kelvin Probe measurements on PFT/PFT:poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole) showed that PFT acts also as an electron blocking layer, and that free carriers are generated both inside the active layer and across the interface buffer layer/active layer.107 Subsequently, Hains et al.108 fabricated a MDMO-PPV:PCBM solar cell using a cross-linked interpenetrated network of PFT and 4,4′-bis[(p-trichlorosilylpropylphenyl)phenylamino]biphenyl (TSPP) in place of PEDOT:PSS. Transparency, energy levels alignment and the chemical anchoring of the insoluble blend to the anode surface (thanks to the reaction between chlorosilyl groups of TSPP and hydroxyl groups on ITO) are the relevant advantages of this composite material. A cell with PFT:TSPP interfacial layer exhibited Voc = 0.89 V, Jsc = 4.62 mA cm−2, FF = 0.54 and PCE = 2.23%, higher than with a PEDOT:PSS ABL (Voc = 0.74 V, Jsc = 4.56 mA cm−2, FF = 0.43 and PCE = 1.46%). The use of PEDOT:PSS/PFT:TSPP as ABL, in combination with a pre-treatment of ITO substrate with UV–ozone, was found to produce the cells with the best performances,53 different ITO treatments (solvent cleaning, plasma) being less effective.
ABLs made of PFT and 5,5′-bis[(p-trichlorosilylpropylphenyl)phenylamino]-2,2′-bithiophene (TSPT), which incorporates bithiophene units, have a better energy levels alignment with P3HT.109 In particular, its HOMO energy is at −4.9 eV (compared to −5.3 eV for TSPP), only 0.1 eV lower than that of P3HT. Accordingly, P3HT:PCBM solar cells with a 25 nm thick PFT:TSPT ABL exhibited efficiency comparable with that of cells including PEDOT:PSS as ABL, while the slightly lower FF (0.63 vs. 0.65) was compensated by a higher Jsc (9.31 mA cm−2vs. 8.57 mA cm−2). More recently, Subbiah et al.110 combined the PFT polymer with an inorganic component, MoO3, to obtain a hybrid interlayer. The combination of 10 nm MoO3 and less than 10 nm PFT enhanced all the photovoltaic parameters of bulk heterojunction solar cells, with respect to reference devices including a PEDOT:PSS buffer layer.
A further example of polymeric ABL concerns the use of pure P3HT (60 nm) between PEDOT:PSS and the active layer.111 A high molecular weight formulation (47000 g mol−1) was used to prevent the entire dissolution during the spin coating of the P3HT:PCBM active layer. The solar cells exhibited a greatly enhanced Jsc, by approximately 20%, and similar Voc and FF, compared to a reference device without the P3HT ABL. The P3HT interlayer avoided the accumulation of PCBM near the PEDOT:PSS surface, which decreases the hole extraction efficiency. These findings were substantially confirmed by using an electrochemically deposited polythiophene (PT) anode buffer layer.112
Kang et al.113 reported that a thin layer (< 5 nm) of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) between ITO and P3HT:PCBM reduces the barrier for hole extraction, improves the energy level matching with the donor component due to interface dipole formation and work function tuning, thus leading to more efficient devices (PCE 1.72–2.27% vs. 0.94% for a device without ABL and 1.28% for a device with PEDOT:PSS as ABL). The highest PCE was observed for a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) layer of 2 nm.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been used in combination with PEDOT:PSS, just above or below a PEDOT:PSS layer.114 In both configurations, enhanced PCE, FF, Jsc and Voc were observed for P3HT:PCBM solar cells (Table 3). A reduction of the series resistance accompanied the enhanced photovoltaic parameters. More recently, Hatton et al.115 demonstrated that ABLs made of oxidised single- or multi-walled carbon nanotubes increase the compatibility with ITO anode. Such buffer layers have a superior transparency in the near-infrared region, with respect to PEDOT:PSS, and confer comparable performances to the related solar cells.
2.4 Self-assembled monolayers
Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of polar organic molecules represent an interesting approach for tuning the energetics at the inorganic/organic interface.39,116 SAMs are able to form very thin and highly ordered dipole layers, which can minimize the energy barriers for charge extraction/injection, if they posses the appropriate direction.117,118 SAM-modified electrodes have also been proposed for polymer solar cells.
Kim et al.119 modified the ITO anode of conventional P3HT:PCBM solar cells by treatment with different functional silylating agents: N-propyltriethoxysilane, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyltrichlorosilane or 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Fig. 5). The silane reacts with the superficial –OH groups of ITO forming a thin (∼2 nm) self-assembled monolayer which controls the barrier for hole extraction and the wettability of the anode surface. The work functions of the anode vary in the order: CF3-ITO (5.16 eV) > untreated ITO (4.7 eV) > NH2-ITO (4.35 eV) > CH3-ITO (3.62 eV). As evident, the work function of CF3-ITO is closer to the HOMO level of P3HT than that of untreated ITO, thus a better ohmic contact with the donor phase is expected in the first case. Accordingly, the PCEs of non annealed P3HT:PCBM devices were found to be in the order: CF3-ITO (1.29%) > untreated ITO (0.73%)> NH2-ITO (0.53%) > CH3-ITO (0.21%). As usual, the device thermal annealing led to a drastic change in morphology in the case of hydrophilic anodes (untreated ITO and NH2-ITO), while the D/A phase segregation was limited in the other cases. As a result, the improvement in device efficiency upon annealing was more pronounced for cells made of CH3-ITO and CF3-ITO (Table 4), and, in the latter case, efficiency of 3.15% was achieved, comparable to that exhibited by a cell with a PEDOT:PSS ABL. Considering the more favourable energy level alignment at the ITO/organic interface, CF3-ITO based-devices were likely penalized by the higher roughness of the anode, compared to those with an underlying PEDOT:PSS layer.

 Fig. 5  Sketches of ITO surface modified (silanized) with self-assembled monolayers having different polarity. 

4,4′-bis[(p-Trichlorosilylpropylphenyl)phenylamino]biphenyl (TPDSi2) was employed as a self-assembled monolayer on ITO anode in MDMO-PPV:PCBM solar cells. The performance of the devices was slightly enhanced, compared to those fabricated with untreated ITO, however superior results were obtained with a PEDOT:PSS ABL.53
Inverted solar cells ITO/P3HT:PCBM/SAM-Au have been fabricated by joining, through a lamination process, a SAM-modified Au layer with a P3HT:PCBM/ITO semi-cell.120Gold anodes were used either untreated or after functionalization with 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS), which is able to react with Au through the SH groups, forming a self-assembled monolayer that exposes methoxy groups to the surface and generates an interfacial dipole. In this way the work function of gold anode is increased. As a result, the device performance was improved (Table 4), especially Jsc and Voc. A better cell was obtained by coating the Au anode with PEDOT:PSS.
2.5 Inorganic materials
Metal oxides have been rather extensively used as anode buffer layers, both in conventional and inverted solar cells (Table 5) for their marked hole extraction properties. A layer of thermally evaporated V2O5 or MoO3 on top of ITO with an optimum thickness of 3 or 5 nm, respectively, was found to perform comparably to PEDOT:PSS in P3HT:PCBM solar cells.121 The values of Voc were higher than those observed for bare-ITO devices and independent of the material of the inorganic ABL, suggesting a Fermi-level pinning122–124 of the oxide work function at the HOMO level of P3HT. Thinner layers, forming small-island depositions instead of uniform films, were less effective as ABLs, resulting in a lower FF for the related devices. On the other hand, by increasing the ABL thickness beyond the optimum value, the series resistance was increased while Jsc decreased.

By depositing V2O5 on the top of the active layer, the polarity of the ITO/P3HT:PCBM/V2O5/Al cell was reversed.49 The inverted structure showed a PCE of 0.66% and better Jsc, Voc and FF than the reference cell (not inverted). Since V2O5 has a work function identical to that of ITO (4.7 eV), the reason for the higher Voc was again attributed to the formation of surface dipoles between V2O5 and the P3HT donor, enhancing Voc of 0.2–0.3 eV;49,121 the application of a Cs2CO3 electron selective layer at the cathode interface led to further improvements of cell performance.35 Takanezawa et al. described inverted P3HT:PCBM solar cells with either a flat ZnO layer or a vertically aligned ZnO nanorod array at the cathode interface and VOx [x = 1.7–2.8] as ABL.125 A thin layer of vanadium oxide (∼ 1 nm) greatly enhanced Jsc, Voc and the fill factor. For similar devices, Sekine et al. came to similar conclusions.126
Kim et al.127 confirmed the effectiveness of MoO3 as anode buffer layer, obtaining a PCE of 3.31% for P3HT:PCBM solar cells and 1.36% for MDMO-PPV:PCBM ones. Furthermore, molybdenum oxide showed to be more effective than PEDOT:PSS in poly[3,3′′′,4,4′′′-tetrakis(2-ethylhexyloxy)quaterthiophene-alt-benzothiadiazole]:PCBM solar cells.128,129 The most beneficial effect of MoO3 was on fill factor, suggesting enhanced hole extraction efficiency and electron-blocking ability. Indeed, the valence band of MoO3 (−5.3 eV) is close to the HOMO of P3HT, thus favouring hole extraction, while the conduction band (−2.3 eV) is higher than the LUMO of PCBM, preventing the electron migration to the anode.
Inverted P3HT:PCBM cells with a MoO3 ABL (1–5 nm) and gold, silver or aluminium anodes have been reported with PCEs in the range 1.30–2.57%.40 The best device (1 nm of MoO3 with a silver anode) exhibited Jsc 6.57 mA cm−2 and FF 0.62%. The authors found that the interaction between MoO3 and Au or Ag is purely physical, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies suggest that aluminium evaporation causes partial reduction to MoO2. As a consequence, the thickness of the buffer layer should be higher in the latter case (up to 5 nm). Thicker oxide layers (15 nm) have been adopted in inverted FTO/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO/MoO3/Ag cells,130 and increased Voc and FF were achieved without sacrificing too much Jsc. By replacing the cathode with Ca/ITO, the device efficiency was increased from 0.87 to 3.55%, with an optimum thickness of 3 nm for the MoO3 ABL.131 Three factors were mainly responsible for the observed enhanced performance: (i) enhancement of hole transporting/extraction ability; (ii) protection of the active layer from damages caused during deposition of the top metal electrode; (iii) prevention of exciton diffusion to the anode with subsequent quenching. Molybdenum oxide has also been recently used in the fabrication of ITO/ZnO/PSiF-DBT:PCBM/MoO3/Au (PSiF-DBT = poly{9,9-bisoctylsilafluorene-2,7-diyl-alt-[4,7-bis(thien-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole]-5′,5′′-diyl}) inverted solar cells by Yang et al.132
A multilayer transparent anode structure MoO3/Ag/MoO3 has been applied to the fabrication of semitransparent inverted solar cells. 133 The inner MoO3 layer served as a hole transporting layer, while the outer layer enhances the total light transmission, thanks to the high refractive index (2.1). The performance of the related solar cells was studied as a function of the thickness of the outer layer and of the direction of the incoming light.
Yamanari et al. reported that a molybdenum oxide ABL in place of PEDOT:PSS is effective in improving the long term stability of polymer solar cells.134 Although the initial PCE of cells with 15 nm of MoOx is slightly lower as compared to devices with PEDOT:PSS (PCE ∼ 3%), they preserved most of their performances after 500 h, whereas the PCE of the control cells drop to less than 1% after 250 h.

Tungsten oxide has a conduction band higher in energy than V2O5 and MoO3 (−1.6 eV vs. −2.4 and −2.3 eV, respectively). Accordingly, WO3 is a more effective electron blocking layer. Additionally, thermally evaporated WO3 layers have the effect of smoothening the ITO surface, while the increased hydrophobicity of the surface enhances a more ordered arrangement of P3HT chains. Overall, WO3 interlayers (5–30 nm) deposited on top of either ITO or ITO/PEDOT:PSS led to solar cells with higher FF and PCE.135 In inverted P3HT:PCBM cells with thin silver anode (13 nm) and TiO2/ITO cathode, a WO3 buffer layer (10 nm)136 behaved alike MoO3,40 affording semi-transparent devices with similar photovoltaic parameters.

          Rhenium oxide has a lower evaporation temperature (∼340 °C) than that of other metal oxides, making it attractive for solar cells fabrication.137 The non-ohmic character of the contact between the donor and the ReO3 buffer layer leads to a relatively low Voc, but does not prevent attaining a higher PCE, as compared to PEDOT:PSS based-devices, thanks to the enhanced short-circuit current.

          NiO, having a valence band and a conduction band around −5.0 ÷ −5.4 eV and −1.8 eV respectively, has suitable electronic properties to efficiently collect holes from the donor phase and to block electrons from the acceptor phase. NiO (10 nm) has been deposited on ITO by pulsed laser deposition, affording cells with efficiencies as high as 5.16%, compared to 2.87% measured on a reference cell without the ABL.48 Thicker layers (20–77 nm) reduced Jsc and FF, and thus PCE (2.23% for 77 nm NiO ABL). Solar cells including a magnetron sputtered NiO (5 nm) ABL gave comparable performance with that exhibited by PEDOT:PSS-based devices, but accompanied by an increased stability.138 Indeed, PCE and Jsc were reduced to half of their starting values after 150 h, instead of 50 h, under the adopted testing conditions. A third method of fabrication of nickel oxide buffer layers was applied by Wang et al.139 They treated with oxygen plasma a thin layer of evaporated nickel, thus obtaining a biphasic NiO:Ni2O3 composite.

          P3HT:PCBM conventional solar cell including a very thin layer of silver oxide (AgOx) between ITO and PEDOT:PSS has been fabricated.140 The AgOx layer was created by evaporating 1 nm of metallic silver on ITO by electron-beam deposition and then oxidizing the film with inductively coupled oxygen plasma reactive ion etching. The higher Jsc resulted in a moderate increase of PCE (4.8% vs. 4.4% for a cell with a PEDOT:PSS ABL). The improved Jsc was attributed to the creation of an interfacial energy step between ITO and PEDOT:PSS, improving the collection of positive carriers.

          Cu2O
          nanocrystals (30–40 nm), prepared by thermal decomposition of copper nitrate in ethylene glycol, have been proposed as ABL in MEH-PPV:ZnO hybrid solar cells.141Cu2O nanoparticles act as an affective hole collection antenna and limit charge recombination. Compared to PEDOT:PSS, an increase in Jsc and Voc has been observed. The improved open circuit voltage arises from the lower ionization potential of Cu2O nanocrystals compared to PEDOT:PSS.
A P3HT:PCBM solar cell has been reported with an anode buffer layer made of CuSCN (HOMO: −5.3 eV; LUMO: −1.7 eV) potentiostatically deposited on ITO substrate.142 Additionally, a 5 nm layer of P3HT was spin coated before the deposition of the P3HT:PCBM active layer. The performance of the devices was studied as a function of the electrodeposition conditions and the thickness of the CuSCN layer. The solar cell performance was found to be comparable to that of PEDOT:PSS-based devices.

          Gold
          buffer layers have been used in the form of either evaporated thin films (3 nm)94 or nanoparticles spin coated from a polystyrene/toluene solution (100 nm).143 In particular, ABLs made of Au NPs exhibit higher work function (−5.1 eV), lower resistivity (20 Ω cm) and a reduced surface roughness than bare ITO or ITO/PEDOT:PSS and, despite the lower optical transmittance in the visible range, the overall performance of the related solar cells was superior. Selected inorganic ABLs used in P3HT:PCBM conventional solar cells are compared in Fig. 6.

        Cathode buffer layers
The role of a cathode buffer layer is the improvement of the cathode electrode efficiency in collecting and extracting negative charge carriers.
Given the high electron affinity of fullerene,10 cathodes with a not too-low work function should be required for the extraction of electrons in polymer solar cells and, at least in principle, high work function metals, such as Au or Pd, could efficiently serve as electron-extracting electrodes. However, similar to the case of the anode, the work function of the cathode affects the photovoltaic parameters of polymer solar cells,20,41,144 mainly the open-circuit voltage, and the maximum performance is achieved when the work function of the cathode is aligned with the LUMO level of the acceptor (ohmic contact). Thus, the main requirements for a cathode buffer layer are:
1. it has to provide an ohmic contact with the acceptor material;
2. it has to transport negative carriers efficiently (electron transporting);
3. it has to select negative carriers, thus it has to block positive carriers (hole blocking).
In addition, the ideal cathode buffer layer should be stable and should not increase the device series resistance. Finally, transparency is required in the inverted device configuration.
3.1 
          Alkali metal compounds

Lithium fluoride is the most frequently used CBL in conventional solar cells, usually combined with an aluminium electrode. LiF was first investigated to enhance the electron injection properties of Al cathodes in OLED devices,145–148 and later on introduced in the device structure of polymer/fullerene solar cells.149,150 Brabec et al.150 first demonstrated that an ultrathin deposition (< 1 nm) of LiF below the top Al contact in MDMO-PPV:PCBM BHJ solar cells led to significant improvement of both fill factor and open-circuit voltage (Table 6), parallel to the reduction of the device series resistance, resulting in an increase of the overall power conversion efficiency of over 20%. A similar behaviour was also observed when the LiF/Al cathode was replaced with LiF/Au, though the PCE exhibited by the related solar cells was lower than that calculated in the case of LiF/Al. However, when a nanotextured Au thin film (6 nm) was deposited before LiF, improved efficiencies were reported for ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Au/LiF/Al devices,151 over those without Au, ascribed to plasmon enhancement of the active layer absorption.

The proposed mechanism for the enhanced performance of solar cells upon the insertion of the LiF cathode interlayer was the formation of a dipole layer,150,152 leading to a lowering of the metal work function,153 thus to a better energy level alignment at the organic/cathode interface. Other authors suggested LiF dissociation and a doping process of the underlying organic layer.154,155
The alkaline fluoride dissociation, with the consequent metal diffusion throughout the organic layer, was certainly the main process underlying the behaviour observed for P3HT:PCBM solar cells made with NaF/Al and KF/Al cathodes.156 Indeed, a strong increase of the reverse dark current was observed, with respect to solar cells with LiF/Al or pure Al cathode, strongly dependent on the CBL thickness and indicating a relevant modification of the organic layer. The power conversion efficiency was noticeably reduced with respect to that exhibited by the cells with LiF as CBL, though NaF/Al and KF/Al cathodes had been successfully employed in OLED devices.152,157
Similar to LiF, a thin CsF buffer layer seems to have a beneficial effect on Voc, FF and Rs, other than on the forward dark current density, as demonstrated for MEH-PPV:PCBM solar cells.158 In addition, the photovoltaic parameters showed almost constant values for CsF layer with a thickness between 0.4 and 3 nm, different from LiF. Also in this case, the beneficial effect of CsF interlayer was attributed both to interface modification (dipole-induced charge redistribution) and modifications throughout the underlying organic layer. As for the other alkaline fluorides, CsF cathode buffer layers had previously demonstrated enhanced electron injection in organic electroluminescent devices.159–161

          P3HT:PCBM solar cells with an all-sputtered LiCoO2/Al cathode and exhibiting an efficiency of 4.1% have been reported.162 Upon a short thermal annealing process, necessary to recover the sputter-induced damage, a strongly increased fill factor was observed for devices with an optimized LiCoO2 thickness of 0.2 nm, comparable to that achieved with a CBL made of thermally evaporated LiF (1.2 nm).
The effectiveness of caesium carbonate as CBL, first proposed for OLED devices,163,164 has been demonstrated both for conventional solar cells49,165 and inverted solar cells.35,49 After thermal evaporation of a thin Cs2CO3 cathode interlayer (∼1.0 nm), a slight reduction of Jsc and a significant enhancement of both Voc and FF were observed in conventional P3HT:PCBM solar cells,49,165 translating in an improved power conversion efficiency of 24–35%, with respect to the reference cells without the CBL. Furthermore, the replacement of Al with Ag as the cathode electrode did not meaningfully change the values of the photovoltaic parameters, indicating that the effect of Cs2CO3 buffer layer is insensitive to the cathode metal.165,166
Caesium carbonate was also successfully used to invert the polarity of solar cells made of a P3HT:PCBM active layer, and inverted device structures with performance comparable to that exhibited by conventional solar cells have been reported.35 The Cs2CO3 cathode interlayer was either thermally evaporated or spin-coated onto ITO substrates, whereas 10 nm of vanadium oxide, acting as the anode buffer layer, was thermally evaporated onto the organic layer.49 Similar results were achieved for the inverted solar cells including the thermally evaporated (PCE 2.25%) or the spin-coated (PCE 2.10%) Cs2CO3 interlayer.
The power conversion efficiency of inverted solar cells ITO/Cs2CO3/P3HT:PCBM/V2O5/Al was further increased by thermal annealing of the caesium carbonate spin-coated layer.35 A continuous improvement of the photovoltaic performance was achieved by increasing the annealing temperature up to 150 °C (Fig. 7(a)), with a variation of PCE from 2.3%, for non-annealed CBL, to around 4.2% for CBL annealed at 150 °C. By increasing the annealing temperature, parallel to the improved efficiency, an increasing contact angle was measured on the surface of the Cs2CO3 layer and a strong and nice correlation between the contact angle and the device efficiency was observed (Fig. 7(b)). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy indicated decreasing of Cs2CO3 work function upon annealing, likely due to the decomposition into doped Cs2O, as revealed by XPS.

3.2 Metal oxides
A titanium sub-oxide (TiOx) interlayer has been extensively used as CBL, both in conventional and inverted polymer solar cells (Table 7). Amorphous TiOx layers can be deposited through a solution-based sol–gel process without requiring high-temperature treatments,167,168 thus suited for organic device technology. Due to its high energy gap (∼3.7 eV), TiOx provides the required transparency to be used as CBL in inverted solar cells. The valence and conduction band of titanium sub-oxide are −4.4 and −8.1 eV,167 respectively, indicating that it can provide both an ohmic contact with the fullerene phase of polymer/fullerene solar cells19 and a high energy barrier for the injection of holes,169 crossing the polymer phase, into the TiOx layer. In addition, the mobility of negative carriers in amorphous TiOx layers has been estimated to be around 1.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1,168 demonstrating the ability of titanium sub-oxide as electron transporter.

The insertion of a 30 nm thick layer of TiOx between the active layer and the top Al electrode of P3HT:PCBM solar cells led to significant improvement of all the photovoltaic parameters, with an increase of Jsc of around 50%, attributed to the optical-spacer effect (vide infra), and resulting in a PCE of 5.0% (vs. 2.3% exhibited by the reference cells without the CBL167). The effective hole blocking role of TiOx CBL is clearly demonstrated by the increased shunt resistance and the enhanced rectification properties of the current–voltage (I–V) curves of P3HT:PCBM conventional solar cells, upon insertion of a titianum sub-oxide layer of suitable thickness.170 Thanks to the high electron-selectivity provided by solution-deposited TiOx onto the ITO substrate, efficient inverted solar cells have been demonstrated, with a PCE (3.6%) comparable to that calculated for conventional solar cells (3.1%), both made of P3HT:PCBM active layers deposited from o-xylene solutions.34 In some papers171 significant improvement of the fill factor is reported for inverted solar cells upon illumination of the TiOx CBL with ultraviolet light, attributed to the desorption of oxygen species.171
In addition to its excellent electronic properties, TiOx has demonstrated significant enhancement of the air-stability of polymer solar cells.170,172,173 Lee et al. reported an enhancement of two orders of magnitude for the lifetime in air of conventional P3HT:PCBM solar cells including a 30 nm thick layer of TiOx underneath the Al top electrode (Fig. 8).172 The devices were prepared without any extra packaging and compared with those without the TiOx CBL. Indeed, TiOx acts as an oxygen scavenger and an oxygen and humidity barrier coating, originating from the oxygen deficiency,174,175 as also demonstrated by the comparison of XPS measurements made on glass/polyfluorene samples coated or non-coated with a 30–40 nm thick TiOx layer.172 Other effects of TiOx CBLs have been suggested in the literature, such as the prevention of the diffusion of Al into the underlying organic layer170 and a less dependent cell efficiency on the level of vacuum during the deposition of the above Al contact.176

Crystalline TiO2 has been also proposed as CBL in inverted P3HT:PCBM solar cells,177,178 deposited onto ITO substrate by liquid phase dispersion177 or by potentiostatic anodization of a titanium layer, followed by high temperature annealing (500 °C) to convert the initial amorphous oxide, showing a morphology of vertically oriented nanotubes, to the crystalline anatase phase.178 The nanostructured TiO2 CBL led to a much higher efficiency (2.25%) of the related solar cells,178 compared to those made of a planar TiO2 layer (PCE 0.85%),177 owing to its enhanced ability to collect negative charges.

Zinc oxide is another inherently n-type, high bandgap semiconductor, with electronic properties similar to those of TiOx. The conduction band of ZnO is at ∼ −4.1 eV, as determined by Kelvin probe measurements on a solution-deposited ZnO layer.179Zinc oxide has been mainly investigated as a cathode buffer layer in inverted polymer solar cells, because the high temperature processing required to achieve crystallinity is not suitable for the conventional device structure. Inverted P3HT:PCBM solar cells with a silver top anode and a ZnO interlayer between ITO and the active layer showed very high diode rectification and PCE approaching 3%,179 indicating efficient hole-blocking and electron-extraction. The ZnO interlayer was obtained by spin-coating deposition of a zinc acetate solution, followed by an annealing process at 300 °C in air. Sol–gel derived ZnO electron selective layers (sintered at 350 °C for 1 h in air) were utilized in inverted P3HT:PCBM solar cells including a MoO3/Ag top anode. By maximizing the optical transmittance of the 120 nm thick ZnO layer through the optimization of the sol concentration, a PCE of 3.09% was achieved. Starting from the solution deposition of dense ZnO seed layers onto ITO substrate, followed by a thermal process at 500 °C, cathode interlayers made of vertically oriented ZnO nanorods (NRs) were prepared for P3HT:PCBM inverted solar cells and compared with flat ZnO interlayers.125,180 The fill factor of solar cells, using a V2O5/Ag top anode, was significantly improved from 0.50 to 0.65 when the CBL was changed from the flat layer to the nanostructured one, resulting in an enhanced PCE from 3.0 to 3.9%.180 The increased fill factor demonstrates that the nanostructured CBL improves the electron transport to the ITO electrode, as expected, by providing direct pathways for negative carriers. Interestingly, the fill factor reached 65% even with thick active layers (over 450 nm), enabling the utilization of active layers able to harvest solar light more efficiently.
No high temperature processes are required for CBL made of solution-deposited ZnO nanoparticles, showing good electron mobility.181Cathode buffer layers made of spin-coated ZnO NPs were proposed both for conventional182 and inverted polymer solar cells.183 Inverted P3HT:PCBM solar cells with a PEDOT:PSS/Ag anode and an electron selective layer of spin-coated ZnO NPs exhibited an efficiency of 3.61%, even a bit higher than that obtained with a sol–gel deposited ZnO layer annealed at 400 °C. In addition, unencapsulated ITO/ZnO NPs/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag solar cells showed high stability in air, retaining more than 80% of their initial efficiency over 40 day of ambient exposure.183Atomic layer deposition was used to achieve a ZnO CBL at low-processing temperature (∼80 °C),184 thus avoiding any damage of the underlying ITO-coated plastic substrate. The good selectivity of the ZnO CBL led to P3HT:PCBM inverted solar cells showing a PCE of over 4%.

Atomic layer deposition was also used by Zhou et al. for the preparation of inverted solar cells with Al2O3 as a cathode buffer layer.185 The as-prepared devices exhibited a kink in the I–V curves, disappearing upon exposure to UV radiation or applying a constant forward bias, and reappearing upon air exposure. This behaviour is likely due to variations in conductivity arising from oxygen desorption/absorption. The devices exhibited high fill factors, good efficiencies and stability when properly encapsulated.
The effect of calcium oxide as cathode buffer layer was investigated for conventional solar cells and compared with LiF.186 When a thin layer of CaO (1 nm) was introduced between the P3HT:PCBM active layer and the Al electrode, enhanced Voc and fill factor as well as an increased shunt resistance were achieved, compared to the cells without the CBL. For pre-annealed devices (at 140 °C for 3 min after the active layer deposition) a power conversion efficiency of 2.85% was calculated, comparable with that exhibited by pre-annealed cells incorporating LiF (1 nm) as CBL (PCE 2.91%). However, differently from the devices without the CBL or including the LiF interlayer, the photovoltaic performance was found to be decreased when a post-production thermal annealing was applied to the cells including the CaO interlayer. It is well known that post-production thermal annealing is more effective in improving the efficiency of P3HT:PCBM solar cells,18 likely because of an improved contact at the top electrode interface, but cannot be applied in the case of a CaO CBL, so post-annealed cells with a Ca/Al cathode where exposed to air to convert calcium in calcium oxide and a PCE above 5% was reported for the related devices.186
In Fig. 9, selected CBLs, alkaline compounds and oxides, are compared.
 Fig. 9  Percentage variation of the photovoltaic parameters of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/conjugated polymer:PCBM/CBL/Al solar cells, with respect to reference devices without the CBL. In the case of TiOx CBL, an additional optical spacer effect was demonstrated (vide infra). The references from which data were extracted are indicated in parentheses. 

Optical spacers. 
For TiOx and ZnO CBLs, the additional role of optical spacers has been demonstrated in conventional solar cells.168,187–189 The use of an appropriate optical spacer is a possible strategy to enhance the optical absorption of the thin active layer of polymer solar cells, through the optimization of the spatial distribution of the optical electric field throughout the device structure.167,190 Indeed, it has been shown that, because of the interference between the incident light and the back-reflected one by the top metal electrode, the intensity of light in the active layer is not optimal, but can be maximized by introducing an optical spacer between the active layer and the reflecting electrode.167
An increase of about 40% in the incident photon-to-current collection efficiency (IPCE) over the whole spectral range, with a maximum enhancement of 50% at 532 nm, was reported167 when inserting a 30 nm layer of TiOx between the active layer and the Al cathode of a conventional P3HT:PCBM solar cell. The resulting enhancement of the short circuit current (from 7.5 mA cm−2, without TiOx, to 11.1 mA cm−2), and finally of PCE, was mainly attributed to the higher optical absorption arising from the better matching of the spatial distribution of the light intensity to the position of the P3HT:PCBM composite layer. The hypothesis was confirmed by comparing the reflectance spectra of two samples having the structure glass/P3HT:PCBM/TiOx/Al and glass/P3HT:PCBM/Al. The intensity of the reflected light was found to be significantly reduced by the TiOx layer, which confirmed the enhanced optical absorption by the solar cell including the optical spacer.
Similar results were reported by Gilot et al.,189 with the use of a 40 nm thick layer of ZnO between the P3HT:PCBM active layer and the LiF/Al cathode of conventional solar cells. To confirm that the almost doubled Jsc was really due to the optical spacer effect of ZnO and not to other mechanisms (such as the additional D/A interface, or the exciton blocking role), they compared the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of devices made with or without the optical pacer. No significant variations of the IQE were observed, confirming that the increased photocurrent was due to the enhanced optical absorption and not to a more effective conversion of absorbed photons into current.
The same authors also demonstrated that the effect of the optical spacer is not only dependent on the spacer thickness but also on that of the underlying active layer, in agreement with the results of another study on TiOx.191 P3HT:PCBM solar cells with different thickness both of the active layer and of the ZnO optical spacer were modelled and the spatial distribution of the light intensity was calculated.189 They showed that the ZnO layer was effective in increasing the photocurrent for active layers below 60 nm, while it was less beneficial for thicker films, and in particular for solar cells with an optimized active layer thickness without the optical spacer. Since in this latter case the active layer was already at the most effective position without the ZnO layer, the redistribution of the internal optical electrical field upon the addition of the optical spacer shifted it away from the maxima of the light intensity. The simulated results were confirmed by measurements on real devices.
Finally, the efficacy of optical spacers seems to depend also on the roughness of the solar cell active layer.187 The dependence on roughness was investigated by comparing unannealed P3HT:PCBM solar cells, with or without a TiOx optical spacer, in which different surface roughnesses were induced by a different concentration of 1,8-octanedithiol additive (0–2% by volume) to the polymer/fullerene solution. Indeed, the use of such an additive significantly affects the roughness of the film, other than being an effective method to improve the performance of bulk heterojunction solar cells,28,31,192 by creating excellent demixing of the bicontinuous interpenetrating D/A networks. Though enhanced efficiencies were achieved for all the devices including the TiOx optical spacer (20 nm thick), the efficacy of the optical spacer was found to be anticorrelated to the active layer roughness, improving by increasing the additive content. In fact, the cells processed without the additive showed a 23% improved PCE, in comparison with an increase of 6% for cells with the highest amount of additive. This demonstrates that the extreme roughness of the active layer processed with the additive interferes with the spatial distribution of the light intensity inside the device.

3.3 Organic materials
Many low-molecular weight molecules and polymers (Fig. 10 and 11) have been proposed as buffer layers at the cathode interface of polymer solar cells. Thin layers (1–10 nm) of bathocuproine (BCP) have been used by several authors92,95,193,194 as exciton blocking layers, inserted between the photoactive layer and the aluminium cathode of conventional solar cells, similar to what was reported for solar cells made of low-molecular weight organic materials.50 However, studies reporting detailed comparative tests on devices without this buffer material are very scarce. The only information on this point is given by Feng et al.93 who observed a 1.5 times increase in Voc and FF and a 2.6 times enhanced PCE, over the ones without BCP. By increasing the thickness of the BCP interlayer above 1 nm the cell performance was limited by the increased series resistance. N,N′-Tridecyl-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxydiimide (PDI) was found to behave like BCP in ITO/PDI/MEH-PPV:PCBM/CuPc/Au inverted solar cells.95

Semi-transparent P3HT:PCBM solar cells, with PEDOT:PSS acting as the cathode and a CBL made of vacuum deposited bathophenanthroline (BPhen, Fig. 10), lithium doped and combined with gold cluster, exhibited a good value of Voc (about 0.6 V).195 When the BPhen:Li layer was substituted with C60:rhodamine B and 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride:rhodamine B, low open circuit voltages (about 0.2 V) and S-shaped I–V curves were obtained, because of their deep lying LUMOs and the consequent bad energy levels alignment. The gold clusters inserted between the BPhen:Li layer and the cathode improved the current by one to two orders of magnitude.
p-Type organic semiconductors, as copper phthalocyanine and pentacene, have also been investigated as buffer layers at the cathode electrode of P3HT:PCBM solar cells, though poor hole blocking properties were expected. Surprisingly, CuPc gave devices only slightly worse than those using BCP as CBL,93 whilst with a 1 nm thick pentacene buffer layer even better performance with respect to devices including a LiF CBL were reported.196
A pyronin B (Fig. 11) layer (about 1 nm) increased the Jsc of polymer:PCBM BHJ solar cells, maintaining similar values of Voc and FF.197 The effect was attributed to the reduced work function of aluminium and to the enhanced electron extraction efficiency at the electrode interface. A comparative cell with LiF showed similar performances.
Addition of pentadecafluorooctyl phenyl-C60-butyrate (F-PCBM, Fig. 10) to a P3HT:PCBM 1:0.8 w/w solution (10% with respect to P3HT) caused a superficial segregation of the fluorinated species and the spontaneous formation of an interfacial layer upon the active layer spincoating.198 The main effect was the reduction of hole recombination loss and leaking current at the organic/cathode interface; secondly, the energy barrier for electron extraction was decreased, since the interfacial dipole generated by the orientation of the fluorinated chains decreased the metal work function and increased the energy levels of the acceptor. The solar cells with F-PCBM interlayer showed improved Jsc, Voc and FF (Table 8).

          C60 and PCBM have been investigated as electron-selective buffer layers by a number of research groups. Slightly enhanced photovoltaic parameters were reported for MEH-PPV:PCBM conventional solar cells upon the thermal evaporation of a C60 layer before the deposition of the Al top electrode,199 whilst an opposite behaviour was observed by Paci et al.200 However, both groups found that the C60 CBL prevents chemical reaction between the active layer and the electrode metal, thus increasing the chemical stability and device lifetime, as also confirmed by a recent study.201 A thin layer (20 nm) of PCBM deposited by spincoating from dichloromethane on the top of P3HT:PCBM active layer was found to greatly improve the reproducibility of solar cells using a LiF/Al cathode, by suppressing the “kink” effect in the I–V curves.202 PCBM was also used in inverted P3HT:PCBM solar cells in combination with a nanostructured ZnO cathode interlayer, leading to improved performance with respect to the bare ZnO nanorods203 mainly attributed to the enhanced optical absorption of the active layer, induced by an improved infiltration of the photoactive materials into the ZnO nanostructures.
Hsieh et al. applied an interfacial insoluble layer of a crosslinked fullerene derivative (C-PCBSD) on the top of ITO/ZnO cathode in P3HT:PCBM inverted solar cells.204 The structure of the crosslinked material is shown in Fig. 10 and is obtained from the corresponding distiryl-functionalized precursor by thermal polymerization at 160 °C for 30 min of the spincoated thin film. The insoluble C-PCBSD film enables the subsequent deposition of P3HT:PCBM active layer from chlorinated solvents. The improvement of both the device efficiency and stability was confirmed by this approach.
A CBL made of ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoborate) functionalized carbon nanoparticles (average size 4 nm) afforded P3HT:PCBM conventional solar cells with a PCE 20–30% higher than that of the reference device without the CBL,205 though superior performance was achieved with a LiF interlayer. The main advantage of ionic liquid modified carbon nanoparticles over LiF could be the easy solution-deposition over large areas. Besides the fullerene derivatives discussed above and carbon nanoparticles, also single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) have been tested as cathode buffer layers. The very poor performance of the related solar cells (PCE 0.01%)114 was attributed to the high work function of SWCNT (∼5 eV).
Both non-conjugated and π-conjugated polymers have been used as materials for cathode buffer layers and, among the π-conjugated ones, ionic polymers have a relevant importance. The use of thin layers (<5 nm) of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) was described both for conventional alternating fluorene copolymer based solar cells206 and inverted solar cells with highly-conductive PEDOT:PSS acting as a cathode.207 In the first case an increase of Voc of 0.2 V compared to a reference cell was observed, and a comparable behaviour with a device including a LiF buffer was found, suggesting that the built-in-potential is increased when inserting the interfacial layer. The higher forward dark current was an indication of efficient electron extraction. The improvement of PCE was about 50% over devices without the PEO CBL.
With a related polymer, polyoxyethylene tridecyl ether (PEO-T, Fig. 10), 15% enhanced PCE was achieved for inverted P3HT:PCBM solar cell, but with an additional TiOx layer.208 A different approach was suggested in ref. 209, in which the spontaneous formation of a thin buffer layer of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) on the top of the cell active layer was attained by adding up to 10% of PEG to the P3HT:PCBM solution, thus eliminating the necessity of an additional deposition step in the device fabrication. The same procedure has been applied to poly(dimethylsiloxane-block-methyl methacrylate) (PDMS-b-PMMA, Fig. 10)210 which indeed, in appropriate concentrations, tends to surface-segregate from the P3HT:PCBM active layer, forming spontaneously an interfacial layer due to the low surface energy of the PDMS block. The presence of siloxane species on the surface was confirmed by XPS analysis. All the photovoltaic parameters increased with the addition of PDMS-b-PMMA. However, the detailed mechanisms occurring in the PDMS-b-PMMA interlayer are not clear. Indeed, it does not prevent Al diffusion through the underlying layer, as demonstrated by XPS measurements. Furthermore, the fact that PDMS-b-PMMA does not have a strong dipole makes it unlikely that the origin of the improvement is the energy matching at the organic/cathode interface. The authors suggested that the insulating PDMS-b-PMMA layer could reduce charge recombination at the interface.
An effective protection from aluminium diffusion, as well as increased shunt resistance and charge collection efficiency, was demonstrated for conventional P3HT:PCBM cells with a polar polyfluorene buffer layer (PF-EP, Fig. 10).211Phosphonic ester groups make the polymer ethanol-soluble and easily processable. The effect of the interlayer thickness on the cell performance was studied and 70% more efficient solar cells were obtained with an optimum thickness of the polyfluorene CBL of 5 nm, as compared to reference cells without the CBL. A different polyfluorene bearing lateral amino groups (PFN, Fig. 10) was studied by Heet al.212 They observed moderate improvement of the efficiency in P3HT:PCBM solar cells, arising from a slight increase in the fill factor. A cell based on a fluorene-benzothiadiazole-thiophene copolymer exhibited also an increase in Voc (1.05 V vs. 0.92 V) when the PFN CBL was applied.
Strong dipoles at the interface, which effectively reduce the work function of the cathode, are easily generated using cationic π-conjugated copolymers.213–215 Cathode interlayers made of polyfluorenes bearing quaternary ammonium groups in the side chains, WPF-oxy-F and WPF-6-oxy-F (Fig. 11), afforded P3HT:PCBM solar cells with an improved fill factor and Voc, leading to efficiencies of up to 3.89%, roughly 70% enhanced with respect to a reference cell with a bare Al cathode.214,215 Surprisingly, this kind of cathode buffer layers is able to raise the PCE from 0.8 to 3.36% in solar cells made of a copper cathode,215 which is an unusual metal for polymer solar cells.
A further example of polar solvent-soluble ionic π-conjugated interlayers was reported by Luo et al.213 They used two different fluorene alternating and random copolymers bearing cationic groups in the alkyl side chains, namely PFNBr-DBT15 and PFPNBr (Fig. 11), as CBLs in the fabrication of BHJ solar cells made of a co-polyfluorene (PFO-TST50) as donor and PCBM as acceptor. Voc was the parameter most affected, with an average improvement of 0.3 V, while Jsc and FF were only slightly improved, with respect to a reference cell without the CBL.
A recent study on polyfluorene CBL bearing tetraalkylammonium side chains with different counteranions (PF-X, with X = bromide, triflate, tetrakis(bistrifluoromethyl)phenylborate, tetrakisimidazoliumborate; Fig. 11) showed that the latter has a scarce effect on the device performance.212 Additionally, only minor effects were observed for P3HT:PCBM or MEH-PPV:PCBM solar cells including the ionic CBLs, while they were more pronounced by using a fluorene-benzothiadiazole-thiophene donor copolymer.
Stable inverted P3HT:PCBM solar cells have been fabricated using a poly[3-(6-pyridiniumylhexyl)thiophene]bromide/PEDOT:PSS composite buffer on the ITO cathode.216 This CBL was produced either using layer-by-layer deposition (leading to a multilayer structure) or electrostatic binding of the cationic polymer to electrochemically deposited PEDOT:PSS. The first approach led to ITO/CBL/P3HT:PCBM/V2O5/Al devices with 2% efficiency and > 500 h of stability.
3.4 Self-assembled monolayers
Self-assembled monolayers (Fig. 12) have also been proposed at the interface with the cathode of polymer solar cells,39 mainly to modify CBLs made of zinc oxide or titanium oxide (Table 9).

 Fig. 12  Compounds able to form self-assembled monolayers used to modify cathode buffer layers. 
Yip et al. fabricated P3HT:PCBM solar cells with interfacial self-assembled monolayers, both in the conventional and in the inverted architecture.217–220ZnO/R-COOH (R= -C11H22SH, -C11H23 or -C14F29) cathode interlayers were inserted between the active layer and the metal cathode of P3HT:PCBM solar cells.217 The SAM was prepared by spincoating an alcoholic solution of the precursor, followed by spincoating of pure ethanol to remove the physically absorbed molecules. The three tested carboxylic acids formed self-assembled monolayers with different dipoles and terminal groups. The nature of the SAM affected the device efficiency and, in the case of a CBL made of a ZnO layer modified with mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA), an efficiency of 4.6%, was reached, significantly higher than that of a cell without the buffer layer (2.4%). Also FF was highly enhanced (from 0.48 to 0.63), while Voc was almost unchanged. Solar cells made with CBLs modified with lauric acid (LA), differing from MUA for the absence of the terminal -SH group, exhibited good Voc and Jsc, but low FF, suggesting that the interaction between the thiol group and the metal is important for tuning the charge extraction properties at the cathode interface. Cathode buffer layers modified with perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PFTDA) led to devices showing poor rectification properties, with low FF and Voc, independently of the metal used for the cathode electrode (Al, Ag, Au).
The role of the direction of the dipole generated by an interfacial SAM, as well as of the strength of its moment, is clearly shown in the work by Yip et al.218 They considered a series of parasubstituted benzoic acids (BA-X, with X = -OCH3, -CH3, -H, -SH, -CF3, -CN) with various dipole moments as modifiers of the ZnO/cathode interface in P3HT:PCBM conventional solar cells. The gas-phase dipole moment of the benzoic acid derivatives ranged between −3.9 D and + 3.7 D, the negative value indicating a net dipole directed towards the ZnO layers. Cathodes modified with SAMs containing a negative dipole led to enhanced performance of the related solar cells, correlated to the strength of the dipole moment, while the opposite behaviour was observed for SAMs with a positive dipole (Fig. 13). As expected, this trend of the device performance was confirmed independently of the cathode metals (Al, Ag, Au). Indeed, while a net dipole pointing away from the metal surface leads to a lowering of the barrier for electron extraction at the ZnO/metal interface, a dipole directed in the opposite direction has exactly the opposite effect, hampering the extraction of negative carriers. Again, interesting efficiencies were achieved with Ag and Au cathodes (3.65 and 3.22%, respectively), in the case of the SAM with the most negative dipole, paving the way to the inexpensive printing deposition of air-stable metal electrodes.
 Fig. 13  Percentage variation of the photovoltaic parameters of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO/Al solar cells upon modification of the ZnO CBL with different benzoic-acid-based (BA-X, where X = OCH3, CH3, H, SH, CF3, CN) SAMs, showing different values of the dipole moment (data extracted from ref. 218). Negative values of the dipole moment indicate a net dipole directed towards the ZnO layers, positive values in the opposite direction. 
A cathode buffer layer made of ZnO NPs and modified with 2-(p-carboxyphenyl)-N-methylpyrrolidino-C60 (C60-COOH) was used in inverted P3HT:PCBM solar cells.219 The resulting devices exhibited an improved fill factor and photocurrent. Such ZnO/C60-COOH CBL has also been used more recently in an ITO-free inverted solar cell with a cathode made of a PEDOT:PSS (PH 500)/silver grid.221
The study on C60-COOH SAM was extended to fullerene derivatives with different anchoring groups (carboxylic, phosphonic, catechol).222 Both the spin coating and the dip coating techniques have been applied for the SAM preparation. All the fullerenes gave similar results, except for the phosphonic acid derivative which is too corrosive for the underlying ZnO layer. In general, these fullerene SAMs cause an enhancement of Jsc and FF because of the improvement of the interface properties between ZnO and the P3HT:PCBM blend: charge recombination is minimized, thanks to the removal of surface hydroxyl groups of ZnO, and charge transfer at the organic layer/oxide interface is facilitated. The replacement of ZnO with TiO2 led to a device with slightly lower Jsc and FF, but the enhancement of the overall efficiency, as compared to cells without the SAM, was still relevant (3.8% vs. 2.8%).220 Additionally, efficiencies ranging between 3.0 and 3.4% have been reported for solar cells with cathode buffer layers modified with other different carboxylic acids (terthienylic, benzoic, lauric).220
To summarize, SAM modification of metal oxide/metal bilayer cathode could represent a new, flexible and convenient strategy to improve the contact interface properties in organic photovoltaic devices, able to be exploited in the low-cost production of large area polymer solar cells.
4. Final remarks
To achieve highly efficient polymer solar cells, the optimization of the electrical contacts is as important as the other relevant parameters in the device design, such as the accurate control of the active layer morphology and the development of high performance active materials.
Currently the device structure comprises appropriate buffer layers both at the anode and at the cathode electrode. The buffer materials are mainly selected on the basis of their energetics and transport properties, the main role of the buffers being the collection and transport of one type of charge carriers and to block those of the opposite sign. It is worth noting that the high charge selectivity of electrode buffer layers is particularly important in bulk heterojunction solar cells, in which both the donor and the acceptor phase are directly in contact with both contacts. In addition, the use of proper cathode buffer layers makes possible the realization of highly efficient inverted solar cells on the poorly selective ITO substrate, traditionally used as transparent conductive oxide in optoelectronics.
As expected, the photovoltaic parameter mainly affected by the use of electrode buffer layers is usually Voc, reaching its maximum in case of ohmic contacts, and reflecting in an improved fill factor and PCE. However, not less important beneficial “side-effects” are often observed, such as improved device stability,132,172 improved absorption properties due to a plasmonic effect,90,151 protection of the active layer against the diffusion of the top metal electrode. 95,121,170 Among those side benefits, the optimum redistribution of the optical electrical field inside the device, 189,167 upon inclusion of a transparent buffer layer at the interface with a back reflecting contact, could also lead to significant enhancement of the photocurrent.
Finally, further fine-tuning of the interfacial properties by using self-assembled monolayers with appropriate dipole moments is a versatile and efficient strategy to enhance the quality of the electric contacts,215,218 as demonstrated by the improved performance of the related devices.
The efficiency of bulk heterojunction solar cells is rapidly increasing in the current years, so an accurate optimization of each layer and interface composing the device is strictly required in order to avoid loss mechanisms and to achieve higher and higher performances.

Broader context
The global increase in energy demand together with the concern for climate change, have triggered the interest in renewable energies and, in particular, for low-cost photovoltaic technologies, which could be really competitive with existing ones. Polymer photovoltaics seems to be a promising candidate for contributing to overcome the challenges set by global demands. Indeed this emerging technology offers the prospect of low cost of active materials, low energy input and easy upscaling. This last potential advantage is given by the possibility of printing the active layer, thereby greatly boosting production throughputs, compared to other thin-film photovoltaic technologies. Especially in the last decade, polymer solar cells have attracted scientific and economic interest due to the steep increase in power conversion efficiency. This was achieved by the combination of improved material engineering and fine control of the active layer nanoscale morphology, and by the use of more sophisticated device structures. Indeed, each part of the cell architecture greatly affects the device performance, including the choice and properties of the electrode buffer layers, used both at the anode and cathode interfaces.
