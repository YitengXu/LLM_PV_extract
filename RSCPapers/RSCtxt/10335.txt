    , Accepted 31st March 2015First published on 1st April 2015AbstractA facile high-energy ball-milling method is developed to synthesize MoS2–graphite (MoS2–C) nanocomposites, which can be used for scalable industrial mass production. As an anode material for a lithium-ion battery, the obtained MoS2–C composite with 30% C shows a discharge capacity as high as 736 mA h g−1 in the first cycle and retains the capacity of up to 720 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1. Even at a large rate of 2000 mA g−1, the reversible capacity is still 428 mA h g−1. Moreover, a high Coulombic efficiency is attained. After carefully comparing it with a MoS2–C composite with 20% C, raw MoS2 and pure ball-milled MoS2, we ascribe the remarkably improved performance of the MoS2–C composite with 30% C to the synergistic effect of carbon coating and nano-crystallization derived by ball milling.
Introduction
The lithium-ion battery (LIB) has been regarded as one of the most important and widely used rechargeable power sources because of its high energy density, long lifespan, light weight and environmental friendliness.1–5 The anode is one of the major LIB components and is crucial for its electrochemical performance. Currently, graphite is the most popular commercial anode material. However, graphite-based anodes cannot satisfy the increasing demand of high energy density due to the low theoretical capacity of 372 mA h g−1. It is essential to develop alternative anode materials with low cost, non-toxicity, high capacity and excellent cycling stability.
Layer-structured molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has recently attracted much attention due to its low cost, environmental friendliness, easy fabrication, and wide applications in many fields, including rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, hydrogen storage, catalysis, solid lubricants, optoelectronics, and piezotronics.6–17 Used in LIBs, MoS2 is a potential anode material; it has 4 electrons to transfer, which could achieve a theoretical capacity as high as 670 mA h g−1 based on the reaction MoS2 + 4Li+ + 4e− ↔ 2Li2S + Mo. For MoS2, preparation is especially important for the electrochemical performance and hence the practical application. Recently, many works have been devoted to improving the reversible capacity of MoS2via different methods such as a hydrothermal technique, solution chemistry synthesis, and template route.18–22 In these works, many types of nanostructured carbons were introduced into the MoS2 composite materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes.23,24 In general, the methods used are based on the level of milligrams, which cannot satisfy the demand of mass production for practical applications. It is important to develop an effective method to economically fabricate LIB anode materials while maintaining excellent lithium storage properties and long cycle life for industrial production. For MoS2-based anode materials, there are few works reported on the scalable route of mass production. Recently, Duan et al. employed a facile ball-milling method followed by short-time sonication to industrially prepare MoS2–graphite nanoflake composites and got good electrochemical performance.25 However, to develop a facile and inexpensive method for the large-scale synthesis of MoS2–carbon composites with superior performance is still a challenging issue.
In this study, we report a very simple and easy method by just high-energy ball milling to synthesize MoS2–graphite nanocomposites, which can be used for industrial mass production on the kilogram level. Herein, considering the commercial application in LIBs, we use graphite as the component to fabricate the MoS2 composites. As the LIB anode material, the as-prepared MoS2–C composite exhibits an excellent rate capability, a high reversible capacity of up to 628 mA h g−1, and a stable cyclability with a remained capacity of 720 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 100 mA g−1.
Experimental
Materials synthesis
All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received. Low-cost molybdenum disulfide (MoS2, particle size < 10 μm, purity 98%) and commercial graphite (C, particle size < 10 μm) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China. The raw MoS2 was mechanically milled to reduce particle size on a planetary ball-mill machine (Fritsch P5, Germany) for 20 h at room temperature under argon atmosphere with a pressure of 100 kPa. Then, the graphite was loaded into a stainless steel milling container and mixed with the as-prepared MoS2 nanoparticles in different weight ratios. The MoS2–C nanocomposites, which served as active anode materials, were produced in the same machine for another 20 h under the same conditions. For comparison, the as-prepared pure ball-milled MoS2 and raw MoS2 were also studied as anode materials. Herein, it should be mentioned that the ball-milling method is easy for the amplification of mass production. For example, in the laboratory, we can readily produce 0.2 kg of the MoS2–C nanocomposite with 160 g of MoS2 and 40 g of graphite as the starting materials in a single batch in a 250 ml stainless steel milling container.
Materials characterization
The microstructure of the powders was observed by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI NOVA-450) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Philips Tecnai F30). The phase of the synthesized samples was checked by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8) with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA from 10° to 90° with a step size of 0.02° and step time of 5 seconds. The surface areas of the samples were estimated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using a Quanta Autosorb-iQ2-MP-ANG-VP. The obtained surface area was 7.134 m2 g−1 for MoS2–C (30% C) (Fig. S2†). Raman scattering spectra were recorded at room temperature on a HORIBA JOBIN YVON S.A.S. system (model LabRAM HR800) with 532 nm incident wavelength radiation.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrodes were made from a mixture of the active material, carbon black (AB) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in a weight ratio of 80:10:10. The mixture was dispersed in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) to form a homogeneous slurry. The slurry was spread onto a copper foil and dried at 110 °C for 20 h in a vacuum oven. After drying, the electrode foils were pressed and then punched into circular pieces. For electrochemical testing, CR2032-type coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box. Li metal foil was used as a counter electrode, 1 mol l−1 LiPF6 in mixed solution of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1, v/v) was used as the electrolyte, and Celgard 2400 as the separator. Galvanostatic charge–discharge test was conducted within cut-off voltages from 0.01 to 3 V at room temperature using an automatic Land battery measurement system (Land BT2001A, Wuhan, China). The specific capacities were calculated according to the total mass of MoS2 and graphite. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out on an electrochemical workstation (VMP3, Bio-Logic SA, France) in a voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by applying a sine wave with amplitude of 5 mV in the frequency range from 1000 kHz to 1 Hz.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the SEM image of the MoS2–C composite with 30% C synthesized via the high-energy ball milling method. It can be seen that the obtained powder is composed of cross linked nanoparticles with an average size of about 80 nm. The structural feature of the composite was further elucidated by TEM analysis. As shown in Fig. 1b, the composite manifests as well-structured MoS2 coated by surrounding carbon layers. It is demonstrated that the ball-milling route gives rise to good nano-crystallization and highly uniform carbon coating, which is favourable for the electrochemical performance. Fig. 1c shows the XRD pattern. The diffraction peaks can be indexed well to crystalline structure 2H-MoS2 (JCPDS no. 37-1492) with space group of P63/mmc. The main peak of carbon (JCPDS no. 74-1911) also appears which belongs to the space group of P63/mmc. No other impurity peaks are observed, suggesting that no other impurity phases are formed during the ball-milling process. The Raman spectrum of the MoS2–C composite is represented in Fig. 1d. Two characteristic peaks of MoS2 are centred at 381 and 405 cm−1. The difference (Δ) between these two Raman peaks can be used to identify the number of MoS2 layers. The obtained Δ value is 24 cm−1, indicating that MoS2 has a few-layer structure.25,26 Moreover, two prominent carbon bands are also observed at 1345 cm−1 (D-band) and 1573 cm−1 (G-band), which correspond to the dispersive, defect-induced vibrations and the vibration of sp2-bonded carbon atoms, respectively. The result also verifies that the obtained composite comprises MoS2 and carbon.

Fig. 2 shows the CV curves of the MoS2–C composite with 30% C. During the cathodic polarization in the first cycle, two distinct peaks appear at 0.56 and 1.01 V, which can be attributed to the conversion reaction MoS2 + 4Li+ → Mo + 2Li2S (0.52 V) and the change in the coordination of Mo with six S atoms from trigonal prism to octahedron by inserting Li ions into the MoS2 layers (i.e., formation of LixMoS2) (1.10 V). By carefully checking, we can see that the broad 0.56 V peak consists of one main peak and one shoulder peak, which should be correlated with the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film during the first discharge–charge process.27 In the subsequent second discharge process, the redox potentials are quite different from the first cycle. The peaks located at 0.56 and 1.01 V disappear, but two new broad peaks occur at 1.96 and 1.22 V, which can be ascribed to the formation of Li2S and the association of Li ions with Mo. The significant difference in the CV plots between the first and subsequent discharges demonstrates that MoS2 undergoes an irreversible phase transition in the initial discharge. In addition, in the anodic polarization process, the sample exhibits two peaks at 1.71 and 2.24 V, corresponding to the oxidation of Mo metal to MoS2, which agrees with the following lithiation and delithiation profiles. In the second cycle, the peak at 2.24 V shifts to 2.26 V while its current intensity decreases, but the charge profile remains almost unchanged. After the second cycle, the CV curve becomes very stable, indicating that the lithiation and delithiation cycling should be stable.

In comparison, the raw MoS2 bulk sample shows three sharp reduction peaks at 1.47, 0.96 and 0.39 V in the first discharge process (see Fig. S3†). In the second cycle, the three reduction peaks become broader and weaker. The peak at 0.95 V shifts to 1.16 V but the voltages of the other two peaks remain unchanged. In the first anodic process, the sample exhibits two peaks at 0.22 and 2.27 V, corresponding to the oxidation of Mo metal to MoS2. However, in the second cycle, the positions of the oxidation peaks remain the same as in the first cycle, but the intensity decreases. For the raw carbon material, there are two pairs of anodic/cathodic peaks at 0.09/0.16 V and 0.19/0.23 V, which are assigned to the insertion/extraction of Li ions into the carbon layer of graphite (Fig. S4†). For the as-prepared ball-milled MoS2 powder (Fig. S5†), during the first cathodic process, two sharp peaks are observed at 0.48 and 0.96 V. In the second discharge cycle, two new peaks appear at 1.89 and 1.12 V. Compared with the MoS2–C composite, the reduction–oxidation profiles are almost the same, only the voltage positions slightly shift. This demonstrates that the redox behaviour of MoS2 is also related to the particle size.

Fig. 3a shows the discharge–charge profiles of the MoS2–C composite with 30% C at a current density of 100 mA g−1. During the first discharge, two poorly defined voltage plateaus occur at 1.11 and 0.54 V. The former can be attributed to the insertion of Li ions into the MoS2 layers, which is indicative of the phase transformation of MoS2; the latter corresponds to the subsequent conversion to Li2S and Mo metal and the formation of a gel-like polymeric layer resulting from the electrochemically driven electrolyte degradation. The above mentioned plateaus agree exactly with the CV curves in Fig. 2. The overall reaction during the first discharge process can be expressed by the conversion reaction: MoS2 + 4Li+ → Mo + 2Li2S. In the second and third discharge curves, the electrode displays two potential plateaus at 1.96 and 1.26 V; the first-round plateaus disappear, indicating that the initial electrode reaction is irreversible. However, in the first charge (delithiation) process, the MoS2 electrode exhibits an obvious potential plateau at 2.22 V, which is attributed to the formation of MoS2. The results are in accordance with the CV curves.

Fig. 3b shows the cycle performance and Coulombic efficiency at 100 mA g−1 for the MoS2–C composite with 30% C. The discharge capacity is 736 mA h g−1 in the first cycle and rapidly drops to 628 mA h g−1 in the second cycle. The capacity loss is 14.7%, which is ascribed to the formation of SEI on the MoS2 surface during the first lithium insertion process. However, the capacity slightly increases in the following cycles. After 200 cycles, the capacity is still as high as 720 mA h g−1. In the view of the total cycling result, the capacity loss is only 2.1% over 200 cycles, which is indicative of a high capacity retention. For the Coulombic efficiency, it is 85.3% for the first cycle and above 93% after the second cycle. Compared with the results reported by Duan et al.,25 our MoS2–C composite obtained by just high-energy ball milling shows comparable capacity but more stable cycle performance.
In order to check the influence of the combined carbon content on the performance of the composite, we prepared MoS2–C composite with 20% C as a comparison. Fig. 3c shows its charge–discharge profiles at 100 mA g−1. The first and second discharge capacities are 941 and 690 mA h g−1, respectively, showing an initial capacity loss of 26.6%. This means that the initial irreversible capacity loss due to the SEI formation on the MoS2 surface can be alleviated by increasing the carbon content. After 200 cycles, the capacity becomes 650 mA h g−1. The cycling performance in Fig. 3d shows that the MoS2–C composite electrode delivers a reversible capacity of about 650 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles. 6.2% capacity fade is observed from the second to 200th cycle. The Coulombic efficiency is above 95% after the second cycle. Therefore, with either 30% C or 20% C, the MoS2–C composite exhibits high specific capacity and excellent cyclability. In terms of capacity and cycling stability, the obtained performances of the MoS2–C composites are outstanding. In addition, the results also demonstrate that the incorporation of MoS2 into a commercial graphite anode can greatly improve the electrochemical performance of the graphite.
We further compared the rate capabilities between the MoS2–C composites with 30% C and 20% C. As shown in Fig. 4, for the composite with 30% C, the capacities are 732, 626, 526, 472 and 428 mA h g−1 at current densities of 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. More importantly, when the current is tuned back from 2000 to 100 mA g−1 after cycling, the capacity is recovered to up to 715 mA h g−1, indicating that the charge and discharge are highly reversible and stable upon cycling at different rates. For the composite with 20% C, the capacities are 941, 685, 476, 446 and 375 mA h g−1 at 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. Although the MoS2–C composite with 20% C exhibits higher capacity than that with 30% C at low current density, 30% C obviously shows better rate capability. Since increasing carbon content leads to increase in the conductivity of the composite, the superior rate capability for MoS2–C with 30% C should originate from the enhanced conductivity.

For insight into the improved electrochemical performance of our ball-milled MoS2–C composites, we compared the composites with the raw MoS2 and the ball-milled pure MoS2 samples. Fig. 5 displays their cycle performances at a current density of 100 mA g−1. For the raw MoS2, the discharge capacity is 484 mA h g−1 in the first cycle and drops to only 60 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles (also see Fig. S3†). For the ball-milled MoS2, a capacity of 992 mA h g−1 is delivered at first discharge, and it retains a capacity of 110 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles (Fig. S5†). Interestingly, compared with the raw MoS2, the ball-milled MoS2 shows much better electrochemical properties, indicating that nano-crystallization derived by ball milling can remarkably improve the electrochemical properties of MoS2. However, the cycle performance of the pure ball-milled MoS2 is not yet good. Therefore, the incorporation of conductive and elastic carbon is necessary to further improve the electrochemical performance. We can see in Fig. 5 that the cycle performance is significantly improved with carbon coating. Carbon incorporation into MoS2 cannot only enhance the electrode conductivity, but also effectively buffer the structural variation during the discharge–charge cycles due to the flexibility of carbon. Moreover, the ball-mill-derived nano-crystallization can shorten the lithium diffusion distances. Therefore, it is the synergistic effect of carbon coating and nano-crystallization that remarkably improves the electrochemical performance of MoS2.

EIS was employed to further understand the different electrochemical performances of the MoS2 electrodes. As shown in Fig. 6, the MoS2–C electrode shows the smallest radius of semi-circle in the Nyquist plots measured after 20 cycles, suggesting a lowest contact and charge-transfer resistance. The lowered resistance facilitates the electron and Li ion transfer in the electrode. Comparatively, the raw MoS2 shows the highest contact and charge-transfer resistance due to its low conductivity and large particle size. Herein, the EIS analysis further confirms that the charge transfer resistance is significantly reduced due to the integration of carbon and MoS2 nanoparticles, which offers more active sites for Li+ insertion/distraction, resulting in high capacity and rate capability.

Conclusions
In the present study, we focus on a simple and scalable ball-milling method to synthesize MoS2–graphite nanocomposite as a promising high-capacity anode material for reversible lithium storage. Electrochemical measurements show that the as-obtained MoS2–C composite exhibits remarkably large capacity close to the theoretical capacity of MoS2, stable cyclability, high Coulombic efficiency and excellent rate capability. The performance is strongly related with the carbon content and the particle size. It is the synergistic effect of carbon coating and ball-mill-derived nano-crystallization that greatly improves the electrochemical performance of MoS2. Our study indicates that ball milling is a facile and efficient route to prepare large-scale MoS2–C composite anode materials with high performance for lithium-ion batteries. In addition, the present results also demonstrate that incorporation with some high-capacity transition metal sulfides or oxides is a potential way to significantly enhance the capacity of the commercial graphite-based anode materials for high energy storage.
