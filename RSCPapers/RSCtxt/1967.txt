    , Accepted 23rd January 2017First published on 23rd January 2017AbstractThe dynamics of photoinduced bimolecular reductive electron transfer between meso-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (H2F20TPP), an acceptor (A), and five aromatic amines (donor (D)) with varying oxidation potentials (aniline (AN), N-methylaniline (MAN), N-ethylaniline (EAN), N,N-dimethylaniline (DMAN) and N,N-diethylaniline (DEAN)) in dichloromethane (DCM) as a solvent as well as in neat donor solvents were investigated by employing nanosecond to femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy upon S2 excitation of H2F20TPP. Systematic studies of time-resolved fluorescence quenching dependent on the donor concentration in the concentration range of 0.01–2 M and finally in neat donor solvents broadly enabled us to determine the electron transfer dynamics in three regimes of electron transfer: stationary or diffusion-controlled electron transfer, non-stationary electron transfer and intrinsic or ultrafast electron transfer. Depending upon the electron-donating ability of the studied donors, intrinsic electron transfer was found to occur in the time domain of ∼1–9 ps and diffusion-controlled ET dynamics was observed in the time domain of 200–500 ps, whereas the maximum limit of non-stationary electron transfer could be observed in the time domain of 15–50 ps. Femtosecond transient absorption studies together with global and target analysis helped to identify the spectral signature of the (H2F20TPP˙−) radical anion as the product of ET. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever evidence that shows the spectra of an anion as the product of ET for any porphyrin-based electron transfer dynamics. However, transient absorption measurements confirm that intrinsic ET occurs in the Qy state, whereas diffusion-controlled ET occurs in the hot Qx as well as in the thermal equilibrium Qx state. The most remarkable fact derived from the measurements of transient absorption was that the rate of the forward electron transfer (CS) is exactly the same as the rate of the backward electron transfer (CR) for all three regimes of ET. The thermodynamic driving force for CR was found to lie in the range of the total reorganization energy for the studied systems and hence falls in the Marcus optimal region, and the CR process is barrierless. The dependence on the driving force of the combination of forward and reverse electron transfer exhibited a bell-shaped curve for all three regimes of electron transfer, even though the rate of intrinsic ET is higher by a factor of ∼102 than that of diffusion-controlled ET. These results unambiguously favour the Marcus theory, in particular the controversial Marcus inverted region, of outer-sphere electron transfer.
Introduction
An understanding of the kinetics and mechanisms of photoinduced electron transfer (ET) reactions between donor and acceptor moieties has been the focus of numerous theoretical and experimental efforts, as they are ubiquitous in light-harvesting and solar energy conversion1–9 and biological systems.10,11 Substantial progress in both theory and experiment has been observed in the last few decades in the field of electron transfer (ET) dynamics. Ever since Marcus described electron transfer theory in the 1950s, in particular the so-called Marcus inverted region (MIR), in which the rate of an ET reaction may decrease as the free energy of the reaction increases, has been one of the most celebrated phenomena in electron transfer dynamics.12–14 After an experiment by Rehm and Weller in the 1960s, the validity of Marcus theory was doubted with respect to the description of bimolecular photoinduced electron transfer, in which diffusion limits the rate of the reaction for very high driving forces.15,16 The MIR is perhaps well established now for unimolecular processes, in which the distance between the donor and acceptor is kept constant so that diffusion does not complicate the study of the ET rate. Examples of such studies include joining the donor and acceptor via a rigid body such as a protein,17–22 nucleic acid spacer,23–26 peptide,27–29 covalently bonded network of rigid spacers,30–46 or charge transfer complex.47–55 However, an adequate consensus on MIR for non-bonded donor/acceptor systems has not been achieved until today and a vast number of articles are available on the issue in the published literature that contradict each other. Deviation from the MIR is accounted for by several hypotheses such as the primary ET product being electronically excited ions,56–59 an increase in the ET distance with an increase in the driving force60–62 and a breakdown of the linear dielectric response of the solvent,63 but none of them are explicitly established.
In liquids, non-bonded donor/acceptor systems give rise to a complicated statistical problem when the concentration of the donor is very low. Diffusional encounters between the donor and acceptor first take place before electron transfer from a donor occurs to any of a number of non-contacting acceptors. Hence, the observed rate constant does not reflect the intrinsic rate of ET but the rate of diffusion. For higher donor concentrations or even in a neat donor solvent, an ET reaction tends to be a pseudo-unimolecular process, as a diffusional encounter is not an essential requirement for ET to occur. In such a situation, an acceptor molecule can be surrounded by several donor molecules that satisfy the ET distance64–67 and the observed rate constant could reflect the intrinsic ET rate. Under these conditions, significant complications in the ET kinetics originate not only from the inhomogeneity of the environment but also from the distribution of distinct arrangements of donors in the vicinity of excited acceptors in the absence of diffusion. Thus, the observation of a unique intrinsic ET rate constant is hindered and a distribution of ET rate constants is favoured, which depends exponentially on the distance between specific reactant donor and acceptor molecules.68,69 A diffusion-controlled reaction starts at longer distances (or longer times), when diffusion is faster than the propagation of the ET reaction front. Hence, the kinetics of ET in such a system should exhibit a transient effect. Seminal works by Vauthey et al.70–72 demonstrated the existence of three regimes of ET reactions: intrinsic ET, in which diffusion has no role, non-stationary ET, in which the rate of ET is a function of time, and diffusion-controlled ET or diffusive ET in which electron transfer is controlled by diffusion. They also derived the intrinsic ET rate from a mixture of these three regimes and rationalized the MIR for ultrafast rates of ET of as high as 1012 M−1 s−1, which removed the long-standing discrepancy between Marcus theory and the experimental results of Rehm and Weller.
Porphyrins, as they are omnipresent molecules in nature, are involved in a wide variety of important biological processes, e.g., photosynthesis and biocatalysis. Inspired by nature, scientists have investigated the unique structure and function of porphyrins for studying the charge transport mechanism73,74 and fabricating molecule-based devices,75e.g., dye-sensitized solar cells.76 In this context, a detailed understanding of the mechanism of ultrafast ET relating to the charge separation (CS) and charge recombination (CR) dynamics of porphyrins is indispensible. Studies of ultrafast ET in different porphyrin acceptor/donor dyad systems have been extensively investigated,77–84 but studies of photoinduced bimolecular ET reactions in porphyrin-based systems have been rather scattered to date. Indeed, references to the role of the dependence on free energy of the ET rate of bimolecular photoinduced ET reactions involving porphyrins are remarkably scarce85–87 in view of the enormous literature on the subject. On the basis of our previous studies, we have found that the free base 5,10,15,20-meso-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (H2F20TPP) is a unique derivative of tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP), a well-studied model system in porphyrin chemistry, in which 20 peripheral H atoms in H2TPP are replaced by the same number of F atoms. The uniqueness of this molecule lies in its electron-accepting ability in the singlet excited state,86,87 which is in sharp contrast to its parent molecule H2TPP, which is known as a π-electron donor. Nonetheless, we have observed that H2F20TPP actively participated in a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) event in a trimolecular transition state, in which the enhancement in its reductive fluorescence quenching behaviour by different phenol derivatives in the presence of different pyridine bases was explained by electron transfer from a hydrogen-bonded phenol–pyridine base pair to the singlet excited state of H2F20TPP with the concerted motion of a bound proton to the associated pyridine base.87 To further clarify the situation, we report detailed and systematic investigations of photoinduced bimolecular ET between H2F20TPP and different aromatic amine derivatives covering changes in free energy for forward ET ranging from 0.29 to 0.6 eV and tuning the amine concentration from 0.01 M to the neat amine solvent to satisfy the so-called three regimes of ET reactions. Studies of time-resolved fluorescence report on the dynamics of forward ET after photoexcitation of the acceptor molecule H2F20TPP, and time-resolved UV/vis pump–probe spectroscopic studies not only complement the dynamics of forward ET observed by studies of time-resolved fluorescence but also measure the dynamics of reverse ET following the dynamics of the radical anion/cation products of ET. The combined use of nanosecond to femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption (pump–probe) spectroscopy, together with extensive global and target model analysis of data for transient absorption, permit us to reveal the kinetics of charge separation (CS) and charge recombination (CR) in all three regimes of ET. The rates of outer-sphere ET that were obtained, which comprise the rates of CS and CR, exhibit a bell-shaped curve of dependence on free energy in the three regimes of ET.
Experimental section
Sample preparation and steady-state measurements
5,10,15,20-meso-Tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (H2F20TPP) was purchased from Porphyrin Systems, Germany and used as received. All donors, namely, aniline (AN), N-methylaniline (MAN), N-ethylaniline (EAN), N,N-dimethylaniline (DMAN) and N,N-diethylaniline (DEAN), and spectroscopic grade dichloromethane (DCM) were purchased from Aldrich Chemicals, USA. All amines were purified by vacuum sublimation before use. All UV/vis spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-2910 spectrophotometer before and after exposure of the sample to the laser to check for sample degradation, if any. All steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded at room temperature with a FluoroLog-3 spectrofluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon, USA).
Fluorescence upconversion and transient absorption
The detailed experimental setup used for the measurements of femtosecond fluorescence upconversion and transient absorption (TA) is described elsewhere.88 For the sake of completeness, we repeat in brief that the study of fluorescence upconversion was performed using an FOG 100-DX system (CDP Systems Corp., Moscow, Russian Federation). The second harmonic of the fundamental beam (∼500 mW at 800 nm) of a femtosecond oscillator (Mai Tai HP, Spectra Physics, FWHM = 100 fs) was used as the pump, and the residual fundamental pulse served as the gate beam. The pump beam was directed to a rotating sample cell with the help of six BSs and one mirror. A lens (f = 40 mm) was used to focus the excitation beam onto the sample. A neutral-density (ND) filter was used to adjust the power of the excitation beam. The gate beam was directed by two mirrors to a gold-coated retroreflector mirror connected to an 8 ns optical delay line, before being focused together with the fluorescence (collected by an achromatic doublet lens, f = 80 mm) on a 0.5 mm type I BBO crystal. The angle of the crystal was adjusted to the phase-matching conditions at the fluorescence wavelength of interest. The upconverted signal (in the UV region) was focused with a lens (f = 60 mm) onto the input slit of a monochromator (CDP 2022D). The intensity of the upconverted radiation was measured with a photomultiplier tube operating in photon-counting mode. Appropriate filters were used before the detector to eliminate parasitic light, if any, from the upconverted signal. The polarization of the excitation pulses was set at the magic angle relative to that of the gate pulses using a Berek variable waveplate. The sample solutions were placed in a 0.6 mm or 1 mm rotating cell, and an absorbance of about 0.8 at the excitation wavelength was generally used (yielding a concentration of around 100–200 μM). The FWHM of the instrument response function (IRF) in this setup was calculated to be about 240 fs in the 0.6 mm cell and 260 fs in the 1 mm cell. Given the IRF and signal-to-noise ratio of the observed data, we could estimate that the time resolution was <100 fs. This time resolution was mainly limited by the optics and the duration of the laser pulses. For data analysis, the temporal profile of fluorescence at a given emission wavelength I(λ,t) was reproduced by the convolution of a Gaussian IRF with the sum of an exponential trial function representing the pure sample dynamics S(t). The Gaussian term was added to account for fast non-exponential processes, if any, owing to vibrational or other solvent relaxation processes.
For measurements of transient absorption, the output of an optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS Prime) was used as the pump source at the required wavelength with a suitable pump energy and fed into the spectrometer through a synchronized chopper at a repetition rate of 1 kHz. A Berek variable waveplate was used to fix the pump beam at the magic angle with respect to the probe pulse. The amplified 800 nm pulse with a repetition rate of 1 kHz and a power of 20–25 mW was focused onto a thin rotating (2 mm) CaF2 crystal window to generate a white-light continuum. A fraction of this beam was sent to a photodetector, which controlled the speed and phase of rotation of the chopper. The beam of white light was collimated with a parabolic mirror (f = 50 mm, 90°). Then, this white light was reflected from a beam splitter and mirror into two identical probe and reference beams. Two concave mirrors (f = 150 mm) were used to focus both probe and reference beams onto the rotating sample cell. Two lenses (f = 60 mm) produced probe and reference images at the entrance surfaces of two optical fibers, which were connected to the entrance slit of an imaging spectrometer (CDP 2022i). This spectrometer consists of arrays of UV-vis photodiodes (linear Si photodiodes) with a spectral response range of 200–1000 nm. Quartz cells with a sample path length of 1 mm were used for all studies, and the IRF was estimated to be ≤125 fs. Given the IRF and signal-to-noise ratio of the observed data, we could estimate that the time resolution was <60 fs. To minimize the signal of the solvent, the pump pulse energy was kept below 3 μJ per second and the probe pulse energy ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 μJ at the sample. For the transient absorption spectra, group velocity dispersion compensation of the white-light continuum (probe beam) was carried out using two-photon absorption data of the studied solvent for a delay of a few ps. All the samples were checked before and after measuring the transient absorption to test for sample degradation, if any.
Transient data and global analysis
To obtain a model-based description in terms of precisely estimated rate constants and species-related spectral signatures, the transient data reported in this paper were also analyzed using a combination of global and target analysis.89,90 With the aim of predicting the minimum number of components involved in the evolution of the transient data, firstly, global analysis was performed via two different approaches based on the principle of superposition of the least number of independent exponential components, which provided a straightforward description of the data at all measured wavelengths and all time points simultaneously. The number of independent components fitted to all the data was determined by gradually increasing the number of exponential components until the residuals were effectively zero. The simplest description in global analysis used a parallel kinetic model, in which a number of monoexponentially decaying independent components, each of which was represented by a single rate constant (reciprocal of the lifetime) and amplitude at each recorded wavelength, yielded decay-associated difference spectra. The decay-associated difference spectra represented the growth and decay of the components with their corresponding decay constants and lifetime values. A second sequential kinetic model, namely, an unbranched unidirectional model, consisted of successive monoexponential decays with increasing time constants and estimated the gross spectral evolution of the data to generate evolution-associated difference spectra. Finally, the data were fitted to a full kinetic model (compartmental scheme) in target analysis by a combination of the parallel and sequential kinetic models of global analysis, which included all possible branching routes and equilibria between compartments to specify the microscopic rate constants that described the decay of the compartments, as well as the transfer of excitation between the compartments. This analysis estimated the real spectra of each compartment (excited species), which are termed species-associated difference spectra (SADS). In target analysis of ET systems, equality between the total rates of CS and CR is constrained to fit the proposed scheme and individual rates are free to be optimized to generate the spectra and lifetimes of the respective states. The entire global and target analysis was performed with the R package TIMP and its graphical user interface Glotaran (for details, see the literature91–94).
Time-correlated single-photon counting system (TCSPC)
Femtosecond pulses at the required repetition rate were obtained from a fractional part of the output from the Mai Tai oscillator passing through a femtosecond pulse selector (3980-5S, Spectra Physics, single shot to 8 MHz). Excitation pulses at the desired wavelength were generated by frequency doubling with a 0.5 mm BBO crystal. These excitation pulses were focused onto the sample using our fluorescence upconversion setup. Time distribution data of fluorescence intensity were recorded with an SPC-130 TCSPC module (Becker & Hickl).
Results and discussion
The electronic absorption spectra of H2F20TPP in DCM solution did not exhibit any remarkable change upon the successive addition of any of the studied donors (Fig. 1) up to concentrations of a few molar, which indicates minimal interaction of the donors with the ground state of H2F20TPP. In all neat donor solvents the absorption spectra of H2F20TPP remained unaltered in terms of spectral shape and structure, but a systematic red shift of 5–8 nm was observed for both Soret and Q bands, which was perhaps due to a change in the physical properties of the solvent such as its polarity, viscosity or refractive index (Fig. S1, ESI†).

Steady-state and nanosecond time-resolved fluorescence studies
The steady-state fluorescence spectroscopic properties of H2F20TPP have been well described previously.86 The fluorescence emission spectrum of H2F20TPP mainly exhibits two emission peaks at 640 nm and 707 nm, which arise from the Qx state of S1 (Fig. S2, ESI†), when excited at any of its absorption bands, and its fluorescence quantum yield is calculated according to a secondary standard method to be 0.058. Spectroscopic titration with donors/amines of a micromolar solution of H2F20TPP results in sharp quenching of its Qx fluorescence intensity without any deformation of its spectral shape, even at the highest concentration of different donors. Fig. 2A shows typical fluorescence quenching behaviour of H2F20TPP as a function of DMAN concentrations of up to 0.1 M. Similar kinds of fluorescence quenching behaviour have been observed for the remaining donors/amines studied. Depending upon the electron-donating ability of the amine derivatives studied, 70 to 90% of the quenching occurred at a donor concentration of below 0.1 M. As shown in Fig. 2B, the singlet lifetime of H2F20TPP, as measured by time-correlated single-photon counting, was sharply reduced on an increase in the DMAN concentration. In all cases, a strong linear relationship between either the relative fluorescence intensity (I0/I) of H2F20TPP or its relative singlet lifetime (τ0/τ) and increasing donor concentrations was observed (Fig. 2C & D), which is strictly in agreement with the Stern–Volmer (S–V) bimolecular kinetic model, as given below: (1)where I0, I, τ0 and τ are the relative fluorescence intensities and fluorescence lifetimes of H2F20TPP in the absence and presence of the quencher (donor/amine) [Q], respectively, KSV is the Stern–Volmer constant and kq is the quenching rate constant.

The donor concentration was kept below 0.1 M to avoid intrinsic ET.

(C) S–V plot based on the change in fluorescence intensity for different donors, (D) S–V plot based on change in singlet excited lifetime for different donors. λEX = 397 nm and λEM = 640 nm for lifetime measurements. 
The kq values obtained from S–V plots based on changes in fluorescence intensity (I0/I) and lifetime (τ0/τ) match throughout the concentration range (0.1 M), which indicates that the quenching process was purely dynamic in nature, i.e., quenching of the singlet excited state of H2F20TPP occurred solely by collisional deactivation with the quencher/donor. The quenching efficiency was found to increase in proportion to the electron-donating ability of the quencher. The calculated kq values are one order of magnitude less than the diffusion-controlled limit. Taking the reduction potential of the ground state of H2F20TPP (Ered) to be −0.6 V,86 its excited-state energy (EQx) to be 1.91 V, and the oxidation potential of different amines/donors (Eox) in DCM to lie in the range between 0.8 and 1.1 V, the Gibbs free energy for forward electron transfer, , is calculated using the Rehm–Weller eqn (2) to be exergonic in the range of −0.29 to −0.6 eV, and that for reverse ET, , (eqn (3)) is in the range of −1.4 to −1.7 eV. (2) (3)The negative values of  suggest that the observed fluorescence quenching was due to electron transfer from the ground state of the amines to the excited state of H2F20TPP, and this ET reaction is in the diffusion-controlled regime. The rate of electron transfer (rate of CSdiff formation) increased with the exergonicity of the reaction and declined in the Marcus normal region (Fig. 3a). All the quenching parameters were calculated within the scope of Marcus theory in the diffusion-controlled regime and are listed in Table 1 (for more details see ESI†).

Femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopic studies
The observation of the quenching of fluorescence emissions in the time domain below 100 ps is significant for studies of intrinsic electron transfer dynamics and, perhaps more importantly, provides a way to precisely measure the deactivation dynamics of singlet excited states, which in turn reflects the population dynamics of non-radiative charge-separated (CS) states. Femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, i.e., a fluorescence upconversion technique, is a unique method for this purpose. An understanding of intrinsic electron transfer dynamics in the H2F20TPP system, in which excited H2F20TPP acts as an electron acceptor, requires a clear idea of the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of the system in the absence of donor molecules, which has been described preliminarily by our group.88 In brief, upon S2 excitation a molecular response was observed via multiexponential decay, and the lifetime of the S2 state was calculated to be 160 fs. Internal conversion from the S2 state to the higher vibrational S1 state (vibrational continuum of Qy) occurred on a timescale of ∼200 fs, followed by very fast intramolecular vibrational dephasing in ∼300 fs, and then the molecules underwent vibrational relaxation to the intermediate excited vibrational Qx state on a timescale of 1.8 ps. The thermal equilibrium Qx state was formed relatively slowly in 105 ps, which is a characteristic feature of H2F20TPP with respect to other tetrapyrrole systems, by collision-induced solute–solvent energy exchange (intermolecular vibrational energy redistribution). Finally, the thermal equilibrium Qx state relaxed to S0 and intersystem crossing to T1 occurred in 10 ns. However, very recently Joo et al. showed, using global analysis of ultrafast time-resolved emission spectra of H2TPP, that very fast internal conversion from S2 to Qy and Qx occurred simultaneously, followed by internal conversion from Qy to Qx.95 Considering this fact for H2F20TPP, we performed global and target analysis of the transient absorption spectra of H2F20TPP in DCM solvent and we propose a slightly improved schematic picture of the transition of the singlet population from the Soret band (S2 excited state) to the thermally relaxed Qx state (S1 excited state) and then to the T1 triplet state (see below).
We have now extensively measured the quenching of the singlet excited (Qx) lifetime of H2F20TPP using a fluorescence upconversion technique in the time range of 10–100 ps in DCM solution in the presence of a sequentially increasing concentration of donors from 0.1 M (the highest concentration at which TCSPC measurements were made) to neat donor solvents upon excitation of the Soret band at 397 nm. Fig. 4 shows the fluorescence decays of H2F20TPP measured for the 0–0 emission peak of the Qx state at 640 nm for a set of concentrations of 0.5, 1 and 2 M AN, MAN, EAN, DMAN and DEAN, respectively, in DCM solution, as well as for the respective pure amines (see Fig. S3 (ESI†) for the 10 ps temporal profile). It is seen from Fig. 4 that in all cases the fluorescence decay of H2F20TPP was accelerated upon an increase in the amine/donor concentration. The fluorescence decays were clearly not single-exponential. A multiexponential, preferably triple- or quadruple-exponential, analysis (with a convolution of the Gaussian IRF with an FWHM of 260 fs) was found to give a reasonably good fit for all the decays, with fluorescence lifetimes of τ1, τ2, τ3 and τ4 and amplitudes of a1, a2, a3 and a4, respectively. A triple-exponential analysis was more suitable for all concentrations of AN and for all fluorescence decay profiles in neat donor solvents, whereas quadruple-exponential analysis was found to be appropriate for concentrations of 0.5, 1 and 2 M MAN, EAN, DMAN and DEAN, respectively. However, the resulting multiexponential fitting curves are shown and plotted with the data in Fig. 4. The comprehensive fluorescence decay parameters thus obtained for H2F20TPP in DCM solution in the presence of different amines/donors with varying concentrations and in the respective neat donor solvents are listed in Table 2. Irrespective of the case study, the first component was found to be a growth component, followed by two or three decay components. The characteristic time constant of the growth component lay between 160 fs, which is a characteristic lifetime of the S2 fluorescence of H2F20TPP,88 and 500 fs. For AN, this growth period was found to be concentration-independent, whereas for the other amines it tended to decrease upon an increase in concentration. Finally, in all the neat amine solvents it was reduced to 200 fs, which was probably the limit of the fastest time constant possible for internal conversion from the S2 to S1 (Qy or Qx) state of H2F20TPP. This observation clearly reveals that intrinsic electron transfer did not occur in the S2 state but in the Qy state, the vibrationally ‘hot’ Qx state and the Qx state of S1 of H2F20TPP. However, the decay time of the last component, i.e., the third component for the case of triple-exponential analysis or the fourth component for the case of quadruple-exponential analysis, is highly consistent with the values obtained from extrapolation of the S–V plot obtained by nanosecond time-resolved spectroscopy and can be rationalized in terms of diffusive ET in the diffusion-controlled regime of ET.68,69 The second component was the fastest decay component in all cases, and the amplitude of this component increased exponentially with an increase in the concentration of the amines/donors, whereas the decay constant remained the same for the respective anilines (Fig. S4, ESI†). The time constant of this component was found to be 8–9 ps for AN, ∼1.13 ps for MAN, ∼1.2 ps for EAN, ∼0.8 ps for DMAN and 1.25 ps for DEAN. The translational diffusion distance (√4DTτ)96 of H2F20TPP on this timescale was calculated to be <1 Å, considering the translational diffusion coefficient97 (DT) of H2F20TPP to be 1.23 × 10−9 m2 s−1. Hence, the very small time constant, as well as the exponential increase in the amplitude on an increase in the donor concentration, confirms that this component was due to intrinsic ET from the donor to excited H2F20TPP in the intrinsic regime of ET.68,69 The ET rate constant (reciprocal of the time constant) obtained in this way or the CSi rate constants displayed a prominent dependence on the driving force and decreased in the Marcus normal region (Fig. 3c). The third component is a critical component in the cases in which quadruple-exponential analysis was essential for the data. The time constants in these cases decreased exponentially (Fig. S5, ESI†) with the concentrations of the respective amine, whereas no systematic change in the corresponding amplitude values was observed. Hence, this component can be attributed to ET in the non-stationary regime. However, in all the neat donor solvents the fluorescence decay profiles are closely fitted with a triple-exponential function, with ultrafast growth (IC), very fast decay (intrinsic ET in the intrinsic regime) and a fast decay component with an extreme value of the time constant for ET in the non-stationary regime. No contribution of ET in the diffusion-controlled regime was observed in any of the neat donor solvents. The rate constant of this ET in the non-stationary regime exhibited a dependence on the driving force similar to that observed for the rate of intrinsic ET (Fig. 3b).

Femtosecond transient absorption studies
Recently, we performed a spectroscopic study of the femtosecond transient absorption of H2F20TPP and analysed the population dynamics of singlet excited states, characterizing the excited-state absorption (ESA), Sn ← S1 transition, and ground-state bleaching (GSB) in detail.86 Here, we exclusively studied measurements of the TA of H2F20TPP in DCM solution in the presence of different concentrations of AN and DMAN, including neat AN and DMAN, for different time windows such as 10, 100 and 2000 ps, with the aim of determining the kinetic parameters of forward electron transfer from the amines to singlet excited H2F20TPP and the rates of reverse electron transfer (charge recombination, CR) from the growth and decay of the transient absorptions. Fig. 5 shows representative normalized TA spectra of H2F20TPP after S2 excitation at 397 nm at a delay of 5 ps in DCM solution and in the presence of 0.5, 1 and 2 M DMAN in DCM solution, and also in neat DMAN. To our surprise, no distinct change was observed in the TA spectra of H2F20TPP in the presence of DMAN, which led to clear detection of the H2F20TPP˙− radical anion, in comparison to the TA spectra of H2F20TPP in the absence of DMAN. However, a systematic red shift in the positive ESA band at ∼430 nm was noticed on an increase in the DMAN concentration, and in neat DMAN this peak reached 446 nm. No prominent change in the position and shape of the negative band corresponding to ground-state bleaching (GSB) at ∼412 nm was observed in the presence of DMAN. However, in neat DMAN a red shift of 3–4 nm was observed in the GSB peak, which closely corroborates the change in the ground-state absorption of the Soret band of H2F20TPP in DCM to that in neat DMAN. The ground-state H2F20TPP˙− radical anion generated upon the addition of metallic Na to a micromolar solution of H2F20TPP, whether in DCM or in neat AN, displayed a strong Soret band at 430 nm and a weak Q band at 575 nm with almost the same molar extinction coefficients as those of the Soret and Q bands of H2F20TPP, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, the absorption peak of the Soret band of the ground-state H2F20TPP˙− radical anion overlapped the GSB and ESA profiles in the region of 420 to 430 nm, and a red shift in the ESA peak occurred on an increase in the concentration of DMAN. This result is consistent with the fact of formation of the radical anion followed by its very fast depopulation.
 Fig. 5  Transient absorption spectra at a delay of 5 ps after excitation at 397 nm of the S2 state of H2F20TPP in DCM solution in the presence of different concentrations of DMAN and in neat DMAN solvent (lower panel). The inset in the lower panel shows an enlarged view of the shift in the excited-state absorption peak on an increase in concentration. Ground-state absorption spectra of H2F20TPP in AN and the H2F20TPP˙− radical anion recorded in the presence of metallic Na in H2F20TPP solution (upper panel). The inset in the upper panel shows a clear view of the Q bands of H2F20TPP and its radical anion. 
The temporal profiles of the TA spectra of H2F20TPP at any given concentration of amine displayed different kinetics at different probe wavelengths (Fig. S6, ESI†). In particular, the TA profiles between 415 and 440 nm, the region in which strong absorption of the radical anion is expected, were critically different from those at other probe wavelengths where the absorbance of the radical anion could be relatively low or nil. This observation has to be related to the fact that these variations in absorbance correspond to the sum of the absorbances of different intermediate states that are weighted according to their differences in absorption cross-section and decay dynamics. This means that the shapes of the transient absorption signals are not only due to variations in absorption resulting from the population followed by the deactivation of a unique singlet excited state, but also result from more complex deactivation associated with different intermediates. Simple multiexponential analysis of the TA kinetics observed at probe wavelengths of 410–450 nm is inadequate for separating their real contributions. Thus, we chose two different probe wavelengths for kinetic analysis, at which there was presumably very little or no overlap of the absorption spectra of the radical anion of H2F20TPP with the ESA of H2F20TPP. One wavelength corresponded to the ESA signal at 475 nm, to determine the population deactivation dynamics of the singlet excited state, which should effectively correspond to the growth of the radical anion/cation (CS dynamics), and the other to the peak of GSB at ∼412 nm, to determine the recovery of ground-state bleaching resulting from population deactivation of the radical anion/cation (CR state). Fig. 6 shows the temporal profiles of transient signals of H2F20TPP at 475 and 412 nm for different concentrations of AN and DMAN in time windows of 100 ps and 2 ns. It is obvious from Fig. 6 that in all cases the dynamics of ESA decay and GSB recovery were quite similar in both the 100 ps and 2 ns time windows. The change in absorbance in the 10 and 100 ps time windows at lower concentrations of AN and DMAN of less than 0.1 M was very slight with respect to the change in absorbance in the absence of AN or DMAN, whereas it was very prominent in the 2 ns time window. In the case of a concentration of AN of 0.1 M, both ESA and GSB decay profiles exhibited an obvious growth component together with a decay component in the 2 ns time window. The temporal profiles of TA at 412 and 475 nm can be fitted closely with three exponential functions with lifetimes of the following values: a growth time of 1–1.5 ns, a decay time of 2.2–2.8 ns, and a much longer-lived decay time of 500–800 ns, which was presumably a characteristic triplet-state (T1) lifetime of H2F20TPP in analogy to that of H2TPP,98 and the fits are plotted in Fig. 6b and d, for which the relative amplitudes of the respective components are given in Table 3. The growth component at 1.1 ns is associated with the population dynamics of the T1 state of H2F20TPP in the presence of a concentration of AN of 0.1 M.86 The first lifetime of the decay component is very close to the value obtained from measurements by the TCSPC method of the fluorescence decay of H2F20TPP in the presence of a concentration of AN of 0.1 M.

However, the Tn ← T1 absorption spectra of tetrapyrrole systems are comparable to those for the Sn ← S1 (Qx) transition,99 and the population dynamics of the equilibrated Qx and T1 states are effectively combined in an experimental time range of 2 ns. Hence, the observed decay lifetime became longer than the real value observed from fluorescence decay. The enhancement of singlet-state quenching on an increase in the concentration of AN or DMAN reduced intersystem crossing, which resulted in a lower population of the T1 state. Hence, the contribution of the T1 population to the ESA and GSB profiles was reduced for higher concentrations of AN/DMAN, which is obvious in the respective decay profiles in Fig. 6. All the ESA and GSB profiles, except those for a concentration of AN of 0.1 M, exhibited monoexponential decay in the 2 ns time window, and the respective time constants are listed in Table 3 for the third component. All the ESA and GSB profiles monitored in the 10–100 ps time window for all different concentrations of AN and DMAN can be well fitted by a triple-exponential function, for which the time constant for the third component was constrained to the values obtained from data for the respective 2 ns time window. The time constants and amplitudes of the components derived from fitting of the ESA and GSB signals for all AN and DMAN concentrations are given in Table 3. Observation of the kinetic parameters in Table 3 shows that the depopulation dynamics of the singlet excited state and the dynamics of ground-state bleaching were exactly the same within the limit of experimental error for all the concentrations of AN and DMAN that were studied. The kinetic parameters obtained for different concentrations of AN closely correspond to the kinetic parameters obtained from fluorescence upconversion studies, except for a slight overestimation of the lifetime values of the third component owing to an overlap between the Tn ← T1 transition and the Sn ← S1 transition. In contrast, the four-component signal profile observed in fluorescence upconversion studies for different concentrations of DMAN was reduced to three components in the ESA/GSB profiles. The ultrafast growth component of the fluorescence signals apparently disappeared from the transient absorption signals in the case of DMAN, at least at the probe wavelengths that were employed. Except for this component, the remaining three components displayed similar kinetics to those observed in fluorescence upconversion studies. It is important to note that at higher donor concentrations, in particular above a donor concentration of 0.5 M, the rate of ET is an indication of the distribution of distances between the donor and acceptor in the absence of diffusion in the vicinity of excited molecules,68 which could be related to the distribution of the electronic coupling matrix element. Hence, in this range of donor concentrations two or three components fit the time profiles of ESA and GSB and fluorescence upconversion data yield a range of ET rates. It is also worth mentioning here that DMAN exhibits notably stronger coherent effects and cross-phase modulation of the pump and probe pulses in the solvent, which occurs around a delay time of zero, than DCM solvent as well as AN for a pump wavelength of ∼397 nm and the studied region of probe wavelengths, even at a very low pump power (<1 μJ per pulse) (Fig. S7, ESI†), which essentially encompasses the early-stage dynamics of H2F20TPP, and we excluded few data points below a delay time of 1 ps to minimize coherent effects in this fitting analysis, which could be the reason for the disappearance of the ultrafast growth component in the case of DMAN.
Global and target analysis of transient absorption data
In order to obtain a complete picture of the ET dynamics, to ensure that the rate of formation of the CS state was equal to the rate of CR, and to resolve the shape of the spectra of the radical anion (or CS state), target analysis of the temporal evolution of the TA spectra of H2F20TPP in the absence and presence of donors in all time windows was performed globally. It is important to note here that on a gradual increase in the donor concentration we essentially move from the diffusion-controlled electron transfer regime to the non-stationary regime and finally to intrinsic electron transfer in the intrinsic regime. As was shown in fluorescence upconversion studies at 640 nm and the analysis of the TA profile for ESA and GSB, below a concentration of AN or DMAN of 0.1 M the contribution of diffusive electron transfer was at a maximum, whereas the contribution of intrinsic ET was very slight. Upon successive increases in the donor concentration above 0.1 M, the contribution of intrinsic ET increased with a concomitant decrease in diffusive ET and finally the predominance of intrinsic electron transfer was observed in neat donor solvents.
Firstly, we performed a target analysis of all the TA data (Fig. 7) for H2F20TPP in DCM solvent in the absence of any donor to resolve the shape of the spectra of all the observed components88 using an improved kinetic scheme (Fig. 8), taking into account the observations of Joo et al.95 on H2TPP, by which at least five compartments are required to accommodate all the electronic states when excitation is carried out on the S2 state. Hence, compartments 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 represent S2, Qy, Qx(hot), Qx and T1, respectively. To obtain a satisfactory description of the TA data, the transition from the S2 state to the ground state (S0) (k10), internal conversion (IC) from S2 → Qy (k12), Qy → Qx(hot) (k23) and S2 → Qx(hot) (k13), the transition from Qy → S0 (k20), intersystem crossing (ISC) from Qx → T1 (k45), and the transition from Qx → S0 (k40), together with T1 → S0 (k50), are considered to be the major processes following excitation at 397 nm (S2). Spectral evolution owing to the transitions from Qx(hot) → S0 (k30) and Qx(hot) → Qx (k34) were also taken into account in order to include intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) and vibrational relaxation (VR) as a consequence of very fast IC from S2 → Qx(hot). TA data were collected up to the 6 ns time window, but the exact lifetimes of the Qx and T1 states cannot be estimated precisely from this data set. Hence, in this target analysis the lifetime of Qx was constrained to fit the value obtained by the TCSPC method and the lifetime of T1 was fixed at 1–2 μs. On the basis of this model, the TA data for H2F20TPP were fitted convincingly well and the spectra of the components, as well as the rates of the fast processes, were thus determined. The lifetimes of the S2, Qy, and Qx(hot) states were found to be very similar, as was observed before. The goodness of the fits is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). The estimated species-associated difference spectra (SADS) and temporal profiles of the populations of the respective species are shown in Fig. 9A and B, respectively. The first SADS1 can be identified as corresponding to the S2 state of H2F20TPP, with GSB at 412 nm and a weak stimulated emission peak at 420 nm corresponding to the emission of the S2 state, and is clearly different from that of other states. The lifetime (τ1) of this state was found to be 160 fs. From the S2 state, two different species/states, namely, Qy and Qx(hot), were simultaneously populated by ultrafast IC with time constants of 400 (1/k12) and 320 (1/k13) fs, respectively. SADS2 and SADS3 represent the Qy and Qx(hot) states, with an excited-state absorption (ESA) peak at ∼435 nm and GSB corresponding to the ground-state absorption peaks of the Qy and Qx states. The lifetime (τ2) of the Qy state was calculated to be 2 ps, and partial population of the Qx(hot) state occurs via an IC process from the Qy state. The lifetime (τ3) of the Qx(hot) state was 100 ps, and it decayed to the thermally relaxed Qx state by VR. SADS4 represents the thermally relaxed Qx state, and its ESA underwent a slight blue shift with respect to SADS3. Finally, the Qx state decayed to the ground state via a radiative pathway, as well as via ISC to the lowest triplet state T1, which was a long-lived component. SADS5 can be recognized as corresponding to the T1 state, with an ESA peak at 439 nm, and it became narrower than the SADSs associated with singlet states.

The X–Y surface shows a heat map projection of a 3D plot, a two-dimensional representation of matrix data in which values are represented by colors that provide a visual summary of the ΔOD values of the TA spectra and, as indicated in the color map, the zero level is colored red, dark red indicates positive signals (i.e., photoinduced absorption), and yellow/blue denotes negative signals (i.e., a decrease in absorption owing to stimulated emission and/or ground-state photobleaching). TA spectra in the 110 ps (A) and 6 ns (B) time windows. Two representative TA spectra (at 5 and 109 ps in (A) and 0.1 and 6 ns in (B)) are shown in the Y–Z plane and two temporal profiles (at 412 and 430 nm) are shown in the X–Z plane.

In order to monitor the dynamics of the diffusive electron transfer state (CSdiff) and charge recombination (CRdiff) in the diffusion-controlled regime of ET, we performed target analysis of the TA data for H2F20TPP in DCM in the presence of very low concentrations of the donor (0.02 M DMAN and 0.1 M AN), for which fluorescence quenching of 50–60 per cent was observed. Fig. 10 depicts the compartmental model used for the target analysis of the TA data in the presence of 0.1 M AN. This model was proposed on the basis of the observations from nanosecond time-resolved studies (TCSPC), fluorescence upconversion studies and temporal profiles of TA measured at 475 and 412 nm. One additional compartment with equal rates of population and depopulation is necessary between the thermal Qx and T1 states to obtain a satisfactory description of the entire set of TA data in order to ensure the same dynamics of ESA and GSB. This new compartment represents the CSdiff state due to electron transfer from AN/DMAN to excited H2F20TPP. The ultrafast relaxation processes of H2F20TPP were not affected in diffusion-controlled reactions. The transfer of the excited-state population from compartments 1 and 2 relating to the S2 and Qy states was not modified, and therefore the spectra and lifetimes of these compartments are assumed to be the same. In the presence of a low concentration of the donor ET occurred in a time domain of a few hundred ps. Hence, the lifetimes of the Qx(hot) and thermally relaxed Qx states are presumed to have decreased owing to the opening of the additional depopulation channels k35 and k45 (Fig. 10), together with ISC to T1, but the spectra corresponding to these states are likely to be the same. The spectra corresponding to compartment 5 (CSdiff state) should nearly reflect the spectra of the H2F20TPP anion. On the basis of this model, the TA data for H2F20TPP in the presence of 0.1 M AN were fitted convincingly well. The estimated temporal profiles of the populations and the corresponding SADS are shown in Fig. 11. Fig. S9 (ESI†) shows the 3D surface plot and heat map of the TA data together with the experimental TA spectra and fitting curves for different temporal and decay profiles at different wavelengths. As was expected, the lifetime and shape of the spectra of S2 (SADS1) and Qy (SADS2) did not change, whereas the lifetime of the Qx(hot) state was reduced to 68 ps from 100 ps and the lifetime of the Qx state was fixed at 2.8 ns, which was the value obtained from TCSPC measurements of H2F20TPP in the presence of 0.1 M AN in DCM solution, but no appreciable change was observed in the corresponding SADS3 and SADS4. More importantly, the lifetime of SADS5 (compartment 5) was estimated to be 450 ps, which is very close to the rate of diffusion-controlled electron transfer (1/ket = 488 ps) as measured by TCSPC when AN was the donor (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 11, the rates of formation and depopulation of this state were the same and the spectral signature observed in the TA spectra was very slight. However, to our surprise, target analysis of the TA data corresponding to compartment 5 (SADS5) showed a strong Soret-like band peaking at 413 nm and a very weak peak at around 500 nm, and it had a very similar spectral profile to that of the ground-state H2F20TPP˙− anion, although the latter exhibited a Soret band at 430 nm. This blue shift in the Soret band of the spectra of the radical anion resulting from electron transfer could be rationalized by considering its high energy, as geminate charge recombination (CR) occurred very rapidly at the same rate as that of CS formation, and this reverse electron transfer took place before thermalization of the charged products assisted by the vibrational and ultrafast inertial modes of solvent relaxation. Finally, SADS6 is identified as the TA spectra of the T1 state, which was almost identical to SADS5 of H2F20TPP in the absence of any donor, and the rate of ISC was reduced substantially. Similar kinds of SADS were observed for H2F20TPP in the presence of 0.02 M DMAN in DCM solution (for details see Fig. S10, ESI†). In this case, the lifetime of the Qx(hot) was reduced to 75 ps from 100 ps, whereas the lifetime of the Qx state was fixed at 4.8 ns, which was the value obtained from TCSPC measurements of H2F20TPP in the presence of 0.02 M DMAN in DCM solution. The spectral signature of SADS5 (CSdiff state) was found to be nearly the same as was observed in the presence of 0.1 M AN, and the lifetime of this state was found to be 260 ps, which is very close to the observed value of the rate of diffusion-controlled electron transfer (4.6 × 109 s−1, Table 1). Hence, this target analysis reveals the fact that in the diffusion-controlled regime the rates of charge separation and charge recombination were exactly the same.

Inspired by these observations in the diffusion-controlled regime of ET, we performed target analysis of TA data in two neat donor solvents, namely, AN (Fig. S11, ESI†) and DMAN (Fig. S12, ESI†), which represented the slowest and fastest cases of fluorescence quenching, respectively. In a pure donor solvent, intrinsic electron transfer is the major process in the intrinsic regime of ET and a very minor portion of electron transfer occurs beyond the intrinsic regime, which we generalized here as non-intrinsic electron transfer. As was observed in fluorescence upconversion and TA studies, the fluorescence upconverted signals, as well as the temporal profiles of TA, of H2F20TPP decayed almost completely within a time window of 100 ps in neat donor solvents. It is assumed that electron transfer occurred well within 100 ps and population of the thermally relaxed Qx state was hindered, and therefore the contribution of the triplet state to the TA spectra was disregarded. On the basis of this assumption, a target model was devised (Fig. 12). At least 5 compartments were required to fit the TA data for H2F20TPP in neat donor solvents. Compartments 1, 2 and 3 represent the S2, Qy and Qx(hot) states, as usual, and compartment 4 originated from compartment 2 (Qy) with a rate constant of k24 owing to intrinsic electron transfer and represents an intrinsic charge-separated state (CSi). Similarly, compartment 5 resulted from the Qx(hot) state (compartment 3) with a rate constant of k35 for non-intrinsic electron transfer and is denoted as CSnon. Hence, the spectra of compartments 4 and 5 should represent the spectra of the H2F20TPP radical anion. Fig. 13 shows the estimated temporal profiles of the populations and the corresponding SADS of H2F20TPP in neat AN. The first SADS (SADS1) with a lifetime value of 160 fs can be recognized as corresponding to the S2 state. Because the lifetime of this state did not change with respect to the lifetime of the S2 state of H2F20TPP in DCM solvent, it can be confirmed that electron transfer did not occur from AN to the S2 state of H2F20TPP. However, the shape of the SADS1 spectra is slightly different and is shifted upward from the zero level with respect to that in DCM solvent, which could be due to the contribution of an unavoidable coherent effect that occurred more in neat amine solvents on this timescale,100 even though correction for coherent effects was considered in the target analysis. The shapes of the SADS2 and SADS3 spectra, which correspond to the Qy and Qx(hot) states, are quite similar to those in DCM solvent in the absence of any amine, but their lifetime values decreased substantially. The lifetime of the Qy state was reduced to 1.6 ps from 2 ps and that of the Qx(hot) state to 30 ps from 100 ps. The reduction in these lifetime values clearly suggests that two competitive processes relating to these timescales occurred, which could correspond to electron transfer in the intrinsic and non-intrinsic regimes, respectively. The shapes of the SADS4 and SADS5 spectra were found to be identical; they exhibit a Soret band at 413 nm and two distinct bands at 511 and 585 nm, but the lifetime values were found to be different at 8 and 38 ps, respectively, which are very close to the decay constants observed in the fluorescence upconversion study in neat AN. The same target model (Fig. S13, ESI†) was applied to the TA data obtained in neat DMAN and yielded nearly the same results in terms of the electron transfer rate, which were commensurate with the values observed in the fluorescence upconversion studies. The lifetime of the Qy state was reduced to 0.75 ps from 2 ps and that of the Qx(hot) state to 28 ps from 100 ps. The shapes of the SADS4 (CSi) and SADS5 (CSnon) spectra were found to be identical; they exhibit a Soret band at 413 nm and two distinct bands at 511 and 585 nm, but the lifetime values were found to be different at 0.83 and 30 ps, respectively (Fig. S14 and S15, ESI†). These results again clearly suggest that the rate of charge recombination in the intrinsic regime, as well as in the non-stationary regime, was identical to the rate of formation of the respective CS state.

Similarly, k35 is the rate constant of formation of the CSnon state and k50 is the rate constant of charge recombination, which are identical to each other. The estimated rate constants and lifetime values are indicated in the figure. The dynamics of states/compartments that were not affected in the presence of neat AN are indicated by the dashed box.

In the cases in which the donor concentration was above 0.1 M the contributions of intrinsic, non-stationary and diffusion-controlled ET were all accountable, and the target model for such cases is very complex. Three additional compartments in the five-compartment model of H2F20TPP are necessary to represent the intrinsic, non-stationary and diffusion-controlled CS states, and the fitting of such a model to the TA data with numerous microscopic rate constants is very tedious and incomprehensible; we refrained from performing a target analysis in such cases. Furthermore, global and target analysis of the two extreme cases, namely, very low concentrations of the donor and a neat donor solvent, revealed the complete dynamics of CS formation and CS depopulation, together with the spectral signature of the respective anion.
Electron transfer and Marcus inverted region
The described results of nanosecond and femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence studies classify the dynamics of forward electron transfer from the ground-state donor to the excited state of H2F20TPP in three different domains: the diffusion-controlled domain, the intrinsic domain and the non-stationary domain, which is a domain between the diffusion-controlled and intrinsic domains. The rate constant of ET in the non-stationary domain strongly depended on the concentration of the donor, as well as partially on the diffusion of the donor and acceptor, and the optimum rate constant in this domain was observed to be in the neat donor solvent. In the diffusion-controlled regime the rate constants for forward primary electron transfer (ket) are derived from the rate constants for fluorescence quenching (kq) using a steady-state approximation of diffusion86,102–106 (ESI†) and are shown in Table 1, whereas in the intrinsic or non-stationary regime the ket values are considered to be the same as the kq values, as diffusion has either no role or a very minor role in inducing electron transfer. In addition, the results of time-resolved transient absorption studies, in conjunction with global and target analysis, confirm the dynamics of forward electron transfer observed in time-resolved fluorescence studies, together with the spectral signature of the anion as the product of ET. The most remarkable factor that studies of transient absorption investigate is the dynamics of reverse electron transfer. The rate of reverse ET is exactly the same as that of forward ET, and these are independent of each other in the respective regimes of ET. For instance, in the intrinsic regime the rate of reverse ET is exactly the same as the rate of intrinsic forward ET, and the rate of reverse ET in the non-stationary regime is the same as the rate of forward ET. Likewise, the rate of reverse electron transfer is exactly equal to the rate of forward electron transfer in the diffusion-controlled regime. The driving force (−ΔGCR in eV) of intermolecular reverse electron transfer (CR process) from the H2F20TPP radical anion (H2F20TPP˙−) to the different amine radical cations (ANs˙+) was calculated by eqn (3), of which the values lie in the range of 1.4–1.7 eV (Table 1) and are very close to the calculated values of the total reorganization energy (λ) for the respective anilines (Table 1). It is important to mention here that Villamaina et al.101 also observed that the total reorganization energy was in the range of 1.3–1.5 eV for porphyrin-based systems of similar size. Hence, reverse electron transfer in these studied systems tends towards the Marcus optimal region (ΔG → λ), and the charge recombination process is essentially a barrierless event. Fig. 14A shows the dependence on the driving force of the CR rate constant for the three regimes of ET. In each case a plateau can be observed at around ≤1.4 eV, which indicates the immediate presence of the Marcus optimal region, and therefore the charge recombination process is ultrafast in nature. Hence, the rate of forward ET is effectively the rate-determining factor for reverse ET in the studied systems. As a result, the population of ion pairs, which are the product of the forward electron transfer reaction, never reaches equilibrium, which in turn does not affect the rate of recombination in the three regimes of electron transfer, namely, the diffusion-controlled, non-stationary and intrinsic regimes, and allows the exact prediction of similar spectral features of H2F20TPP˙− in the target analysis of transient absorption data in the three electron transfer regimes, respectively. Nevertheless, considering forward electron transfer (CS process for the studied donor–acceptor systems) and reverse electron transfer (CR process of ion pair products of the studied donor–acceptor systems) as simple electron transfer events in different exergonic reactions, we plotted the reaction rate as a function of the driving force (Fig. 14B). As shown in Fig. 14B, for all three regimes the rate constants of the ET reaction exhibited good bell-shaped curves for dependence on changes in free energy, which confirms the observation of the Marcus inverted region. These observations of outer-sphere electron transfer provide unambiguous evidence of the Marcus theory of electron transfer, by which the rate of ET reactions may decrease as the free energy of the reaction increases, which has been one of the most celebrated events in electron transfer dynamics.

Conclusions
We have successfully examined the dynamics of photoinduced forward and reverse ET between the ground state of amines and the singlet excited state of H2F20TPP in the three regimes of electron transfer, namely, the intrinsic, non-stationary and diffusion-controlled regimes, by systematically tuning the amine concentration from 0.01 M to the neat amine solvent. Studies of fluorescence quenching by time-correlated single-photon counting revealed diffusion-controlled dynamics of forward ET (CSdiff) in the diffusion-controlled regime, whereas fluorescence upconversion studies revealed intrinsic dynamics of forward ET (CSi) in the intrinsic regime, as well as non-stationary dynamics of forward ET (CSnon). Studies of femtosecond transient absorption, together with global and target analysis, not only confirm the dynamics of forward ET in the three regimes of ET but also prove that in each region of electron transfer the rates of charge recombination are exactly equal to the rates of charge separation. Target analysis of TA data constructed the spectral signature of H2F20TPP˙− as the product of electron transfer, and, to our knowledge, this is the first ever example of the spectra of a porphyrin anion as the product of ET. Furthermore, target analysis of TA data established that intrinsic ET occurs in the Qy state, non-stationary ET occurs in the Qx(hot) state, and diffusion-controlled ET occurs partially in the Qx(hot) state and in the thermally relaxed Qx state of H2F20TPP upon excitation of the S2 state at 397 nm. The described results confirm that forward electron transfer is in the Marcus normal region, whereas reverse electron transfer tends towards the Marcus optimal region, which makes it a barrierless event, and, therefore, the rate of CS proves to be the rate-determining factor for CR. The dependences on free energy of the rates of CS and CR both display a good bell-shaped curve for all three regimes of ET. This result provides strong and clear evidence of the MIR for outer-sphere ET and helps to resolve the controversy over MIR for non-covalent systems.

 	Fig. 7  3D surface plot of TA spectra of H2F20TPP in DCM in the absence of a donor. The X-axis represents time, the Y-axis represents the wavelength and the Z-axis represents ΔOD. The X–Y surface shows a heat map projection of a 3D plot, a two-dimensional representation of matrix data in which values are represented by colors that provide a visual summary of the ΔOD values of the TA spectra and, as indicated in the color map, the zero level is colored red, dark red indicates positive signals (i.e., photoinduced absorption), and yellow/blue denotes negative signals (i.e., a decrease in absorption owing to stimulated emission and/or ground-state photobleaching). TA spectra in the 110 ps (A) and 6 ns (B) time windows. Two representative TA spectra (at 5 and 109 ps in (A) and 0.1 and 6 ns in (B)) are shown in the Y–Z plane and two temporal profiles (at 412 and 430 nm) are shown in the X–Z plane.

The estimated rate constants and lifetime values are indicated in the figure. The dynamics of states/compartments that were not affected in the presence of 0.1 M AN are indicated by the dashed box.

 	Fig. 12  Schematic of kinetic model used for target analysis of TA data matrices of H2F20TPP in neat AN upon excitation at 397 nm. τ1, τ2, τ3, τ4, τ5 and τ6 are the global lifetimes of the respective states/compartments. k10, k12, k13, k20, k23, k24, k30, k34, k35, k40, and k50 are the microscopic rate constants of the respective transitions. k24 is the rate constant of formation of the CSi state and k40 is the rate constant of charge recombination, which has a value equal to that of k24. Similarly, k35 is the rate constant of formation of the CSnon state and k50 is the rate constant of charge recombination, which are identical to each other. The estimated rate constants and lifetime values are indicated in the figure. The dynamics of states/compartments that were not affected in the presence of neat AN are indicated by the dashed box.	 

 	Fig. 13  Estimated species-associated difference spectra (SADS) of H2F20TPP in neat AN derived from target analysis (A) and the population profiles of the respective states/compartments (B). The insets in (A) show the normalized SADS4 and SADS5 corresponding to CSi and CSnon, and the inset in (B) shows the population profiles in the 10 ps time window.	 

 	Fig. 14  (A) Dependence on the driving force of the rate constant for electron transfer (ket) in events of bimolecular electron transfer from the ground-state donor (different anilines) to the excited acceptor (H2F20TPP) and from the acceptor radical anion to the donor radical cation for the three regimes of electron transfer.
