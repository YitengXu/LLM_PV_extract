    , Accepted 19th January 2017First published on 20th January 2017AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites (e.g., CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) hold great promise in optoelectronic devices, e.g., solar cells. High-performance devices have been realized by controlling the perovskite surface morphology, grain size, and degree of crystallinity. However, the role of the components during film formation and crystallization remains mysterious. Here, we show the management of perovskite intermediates to construct perovskite films with uniform perovskite crystals and controlled surface morphology using methylammonium acetate (MAAc) to retard the reaction between PbI2 and MAI in the solution. The formation of MAPbI3 was allowed via the exchange of I− anions from the neighboring MAI molecules to the perovskite intermediate phases replacing Ac− anions. A highly efficient perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 18.09% was achieved. The experimental and theoretical studies reveal that perovskite intermediates play an important role in facilitating homogeneous nucleation or modulating the crystallization kinetics. These results also provide important progress towards the understanding of perovskite intermediate phases for advancing the building of perovskite semiconductors.
Owing to their high absorption coefficients,1 tunable bandgaps,2–4 high ambipolar charge mobility,5 low exciton binding energy,6 and long electron and hole diffusion lengths,7–9 organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, e.g., CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), offer promising routes for the development of low-cost and high-performance optoelectronic devices.10–14 In particular, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite based solar cells have attracted enormous attention of research and industrial communities and emerged as the forerunner for thin-film photovoltaics in the past four years.1,12,13,15–18 Benefiting from the 25 years' development of polymer solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has most recently been rapidly improved from 3.8% in 2009 to a certified 22.1% in 2015,19,20 which is comparable to that of state-of-the-art copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) solar cells and approaching that of commercial monocrystalline silicon solar cells,21 especially considering the advantages of cost effective solution-processability for the large-scale deployment of solar energy.
High-quality perovskite films are a prerequisite to perovskite solar cells operation. The most developed deposition procedures for the perovskite layer include one-step solution deposition,1 two-step sequential deposition,12,22 dual-source vapor deposition,16,23 vapor-assisted solution deposition,24 vacuum flash-assisted deposition25 or combinations thereof. Among these fabrication techniques, one-step solution deposition of an equimolar mixture of methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) and lead(II) iodide (PbI2) precursor solution is the simplest way and also is one of the most possible ways for realizing large-area full-printing manufacturing. The main issue that needs to be well controlled in this one-step solution deposition is the film morphology such as surface uniformity, surface coverage, and crystal size, which is expected to reduce the electrical shunt, the probability of charge recombination, and the bulk traps during device operation and thus giving high-performance solar cells. However, a needle-like shiny gray perovskite morphology is involved while just simply spin-coating the MAI and PbI2 precursor solution,26,27 which results in incomplete coverage of the resultant film.
Due to the fact that the perovskite morphology in this one-step solution deposition is controlled by nucleation and crystal growth during film formation, tremendous efforts have been made, such as dropping anti-solvent during spin-coating,26,27 using a large excess of organic component,1 employing hot-substrate casting,13 and adding additives.28–33 Very recently, constructing perovskite intermediates for high-quality perovskite films has been demonstrated.34–40 Highly uniform and dense perovskite films, with effective charge extraction capability, high crystallinity, and a slow recombination rate, were fabricated via, e.g., Lewis base adduct by forming the adduct of MAI·PbI2·DMSO (DMSO: N,N-dimethyl sulfoxide) due to interactions between Lewis base DMSO and Lewis acid PbI2;36 a new precursor compound HPbI3 by the reaction of HI and PbI2;37 MAH2PO2 impurities by forming an intermediate phase of Pb(H2PO2)2 with PbI2.38 Although uniform perovskite films were made, control over the surface structure, grain size, and degree of crystallinity remains the key scientific challenges for the realization of high performance devices. Moreover, the role of the components during film formation and crystallization remains mysterious.41 A complete understanding of these issues is hence critically important for advancing the understanding of perovskite semiconductors and thus the solar cell performance.
Here, we report a high-efficiency perovskite solar cell employing perovskite films with uniform perovskite crystals and controlled surface morphology via managing perovskite intermediates. The process utilizes the rapid formation of perovskite intermediate phases between PbI2 and methyl ammonium acetate (MAAc) to retard the reaction between PbI2 and MAI in the solution. At a certain temperature, the formation of MAPbI3 was allowed via the exchange of I− anions from the neighboring MAI molecules to the perovskite intermediate phases replacing Ac− anions. The photovoltaic device exhibits a very high solar-to-electric PCE of 18.09%, which is one of the top performances based on the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM) charge transporting layer. Our findings reveal that perovskite intermediates play an important role in facilitating homogeneous nucleation or modulating the crystallization kinetics. These results also provide important progress towards the understanding of the role of the perovskite intermediate phase in the realization of low-cost and highly efficient perovskite solar cells.
Briefly, this facile one-step solution deposition was manipulated by adding MAAc to the standard precursor solutions of MAI and PbI2 (1:1) in dimethylformamide (DMF) (PbI2:MAI:MAAc = 1:1:1.5), followed by spin-coating to form perovskite films. This ensures faster crystal growth and the rapid loss of excess MAAc. Fig. 1a shows a picture of ice-like MAAc solid. The thermal characteristics of MAAc were analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. 1b. The TGA measurements of MAI and PbI2 were also conducted for comparison. We found that the MAI and PbI2 powders do not show any weight loss even when the temperature is about 200 °C whereas MAAc starts to lose weight near 60 °C, exhibiting thermal instability. In order to understand the function of MAAc in the PbI2·MAI·MAAc precursor, we compared PbI2 only and the mixture of MAAc and PbI2 (1.5:1) dissolved in DMF. Interestingly, we can clearly see from Fig. 1c that PbI2 only in DMF shows a turbid solution while the MAAc and PbI2 blend solution gives a clear transparent yellow color, which implies that PbI2 may react with MAAc as the reaction between PbI2 and MAI. Moreover, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the film made from the MAAc and PbI2 (1.5:1) blend solution gave well-developed crystals and pits, where the crystals could be MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite whereas the pits originate from the evaporation of excess of MAAc during the film formation. This MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite can be evident from the XRD profiles shown in Fig. 1e, where the XRD diffraction peaks of the (001), (101), (003), and (004) at 12.12°, 25.68°, 38.48°, and 52.32° characteristic of PbI2 disappeared (ESI, Fig. S1†), which was accompanied by the concomitant appearance of the (110), (220), and (330) diffractions at 13.76°, 28.08°, and 42.92°, respectively, arising from the tetragonal perovskite. This result implies that the PbI2 is totally reacted with MAAc and the resultant MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite is self-organized and highly crystalline in nature. Note that no MAAc peaks can also be detected (ESI, Fig. S2†), indicating that the excess of MAAc could be evaporated during the MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite formation, which is consistent with the TGA measurement. This MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite, however, is unstable because it is easy for it to totally decompose to PbI2 after thermal treatment at 100 °C for 15 minutes by evaporation of MAAc (Fig. 1e), as is evident from the formation of the features associated with the absorbance of PbI2 corresponding to a peak at 500 nm (ESI, Fig. S3†).42 The performance of devices based on MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite was also studied (ESI, Fig. S4†), showing very low current density and low PCE due to the poor absorption. To get further information for the MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite, we compared it with the FTIR patterns of MAAc, MAI, MAPbI3 from the MAI·PbI2 precursor, and MAPbI3 from the PbI2·MAI·MAAc precursor, as shown in Fig. 1f. The MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite exhibits featured absorption of MA+ and Ac− as compared to that of MAAc, which means that the MAAc can be stable in MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite at room temperature.

(g) Schematic diagram of the proposed PbI2, MAAc, and DMF interactions. 
Therefore, a mechanism was proposed for the formation of the MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite intermediate assisted by MAAc. As shown in Fig. 1g, the I–Pb–I layered structure of the PbI2 crystals is the near-octahedron PbI64− structure as its basic building block. PbI2 can be dissolved in DMF due to the fact that Pb atoms are covalently bonded to O atoms via the formation of Pb–O bonding, which was verified by a DMF-induced intermediate phase.43 DMF molecules intercalate into the layered structure and induce a little expansion in the PbI2 lattice along the c axis. Along with the release of DMF molecules, the layered PbI2 structure is recovered. By the introduction of MAAc in the PbI2 + DMF precursor solution, MAAc are incorporated in the crystal lattice of PbI2 in the form of MA+ and Ac− as part of a solid solution or an alloy. In this case, the PbI2 lattice can be significantly expanded along the c axis and hence increasing the solubility of PbI2 in DMF solution, which is evident from the formation of a clear yellow solution shown in Fig. 1c. After removal of DMF molecules, the MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite intermediate can be formed by self-assembly, favorable to crystallization of the final MAPbI3 film.
To gain further insights into the mechanism of MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite formation and ensure the stable existence of the perovskite phase, we performed first-principles calculations using density functional theory (DFT) methods to determine the electronic structures and configuration of MAPbI3 (as a reference) and MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite upon Ac substitution (Fig. 2). In order to investigate the effect of Ac addition, first of all we studied the effect of substitution by one Ac on two different I sites (Wyckoff positions 4a and 8h, respectively). Because there are 12 I atoms in one unit cell, this is equivalent of simulating chemical formula MAPbAc0.25I2.75 (Fig. 2b and c). We first study the two different configurations of Ac substitution as shown in Fig. 2b and c as compared to pure MAPbI3 (Fig. 2a). Because in either case there is only 1 out of 12 I ions substituted, we keep the lattice unchanged as a good approximation. The structure with substitution at position 4a (Fig. 2b) has 0.15 eV lower total energy than the 8h-substituted structure (Fig. 2c). This indicates the preference substitution and better thermal stability of Ac at position 4a. We also tried to identify a new crystal by substituting all I anions with Ac anions making MAPbAc3 (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, a stable tetragonal structure MAPbAc3 (Fig. 2d) was found with different lattice constants and band gaps. The lattice expanded roughly about 7% in a/b directions, and 11% in the c direction, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†).

The Wyckoff position of the substitution is 4a and 8h in (b) and (c), respectively. Pb, I, O, C, N, and H atoms are represented in gray, purple, red, brown, blue and pink, respectively. Each of the oxygen ions of one Ac bonds to a lead ion. (e) MAPbI3, (g) position 4a substituted MAPbAc0.25I2.75, and (i) MAPbAc3 give the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) non-spin–orbit coupling (NSOC) calculated projected density of states (PDOS). (f) MAPbI3, (h) position 4a substituted MAPbAc0.25I2.75, and (j) MAPbAc3 show the z-direction only PDOS (6pz) of two different Pb atoms. Pb (0 0 0) is bonded with the ion at position 4a, while Pb (0.5 0.5 0) is not bonded with 4a. 
For pure MAPbI3, our electronic structure calculations show that the C–N, C–H, N–H hybridization levels all are located deep in the valence band, as shown in the projected density of states (PDOS) plotted in Fig. 2e and f. The valence band maximum (VBM) consists mainly of I-5p levels and the conduction band minimum (CBM) consists mainly of Pb-6p levels. As expected, the two Pb atoms show perfect degeneracy. The O-2p levels hybridize with I-5p levels and become part of the top of the valence band after Ac addition. The Ac ion also breaks down the symmetry in the crystal, hence leading to degeneracy of related bands. This results in the increase of the electron effective mass, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The conduction band is significantly altered by the presence of the Ac anion, as shown in Fig. 2g and h. According to our relaxed crystal structures, the average Pb–I bond length in MAPbI3 is 3.25 Å and the Pb–O bond length is 2.50 Å. Shorter and stronger Pb–O ionic bonds tend to open up a larger energy gap. We can clearly read from the PDOS diagram that the pz component of the O bonded Pb (0 0 0) is lifted up in the conduction band. The new CBM becomes a mixture of the Pb pxyz components of the non-oxygen bonded Pb and the pxy components of the O bonded Pb, which will move toward a high energy direction accordingly compared to non-Ac cases. As a result, the overall band gap will increase in Ac added materials. The fully Ac-substituted structure has a slightly expanded lattice, as shown in Fig. 2i and j; nevertheless, the band gap is 1.09/1.11 eV larger than MAPbI3 with non-spin–orbit coupling/spin–orbit coupling (NSOC/SOC). Because adding in Ac ions removes the D4h point group symmetry in the crystal, degeneracy breaking is very significant in both valence and conduction bands. The single (double with SOC) band CBM degrades to several more compact bands, which corresponds to a larger conduction electron effective mass in Table S1 (ESI†). With larger carrier effective masses, our calculations suggest MAPbAc3 to have lower carrier mobilities and hence less transport efficiency compared to MAPI3. Although the point group symmetry is broken, the Pb–O length of all Pb atoms is roughly the same (∼2.50 Å), hence no similar shift in the pz decomposed PDOS diagram is observed. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the band gap expands monotonically with increasing Ac concentration. Combining the fact that the experimental band gap of the MAPbI3 is reported as 1.55 eV, and our calculated band gap of MAPbAc3 is 1.11 eV (2.66 eV) higher than that of MAPbI3, we can evaluate the band gap of the MAPbAcxI3−x mixture to be between 1.55 eV and 2.66 eV. We believe that this is the fundamental reason for the mixed crystal to lose the absorption efficiency in the long wavelength region.
The schematic diagram of the deposition of perovskite materials by our technology is presented in Fig. 3a. Our approach involves three stages: first, a room-temperature mixture of PbI2 and MAI solution with an amount of MAAc (e.g., PbI2:MAI:MAAc = 1:1:1.5) is spread over the entire surface of a substrate maintained at a temperature of 80 °C. Second, the spin-coater is accelerated to the desired rotational speed and maintained for 30 seconds to evaporate the solvent to obtain a uniform film. During spin-coating, in detail, for the first three seconds after spinning, removal of excess precursor solution is a dominant process. After three seconds (4–6 s), evaporation of the residue solvent occurs significantly concentrating the perovskite solution and the perovskite solution reaches supersaturation. After six seconds (7–30 s), the MAAc starts to evaporate and the liquid film starts to dry, from which a dense and uniform film is formed. We can clearly see a change in the color of the film from yellow to light brown and getting darker with further spin, characteristic of the perovskite phase. Third, the as-cast film is converted into a highly uniform and crystalline perovskite on annealing at 100 °C for 1 min with enhanced featured perovskite diffraction peaks and absorption at longer wavelength (ESI, Fig. S5†). It should be noted that there is no MAAc left in the final MAPbI3 perovskite phase, which can be suggested from the FTIR spectra (Fig. 1f), where MAPbI3 from the MAI·PbI2 precursor and MAPbI3 from the MAI·PbI2·MAAc precursor exhibit the same absorption peaks.

On the basis of the above observations, we propose a plausible mechanism of the whole reaction process in the PbI2·MAI·MAAc precursor and the final MAPbI3 perovskite formation is shown in Fig. 3b. First, PbI2 as a layered semiconductor material contains a plane of Pb2+ cations sandwiched between adjacent layers of hexagonally arranged iodide ions. The interlayer spaces allow rapid intercalation of different molecules, e.g., MAAc and MAI, owing to the weak bonding between the two planes by van der Waals-type interactions, leading to the expansion of the interlayer distance along the c axis. During spin-coating, on one hand, the MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite intermediate phase can be formed (Path 1). However, this MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite is deformed with a reduction in the crystal lattice parameter because of the ionic radius of Ac− (0.162 nm) < I− (0.220 nm).44 As we demonstrated above, the MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite is a thermally unstable material. Accordingly, the MAAc was easily evaporated on a warm substrate due to its low decomposition temperature and the I− anion could migrate to the crystal lattice quickly at the same time replacing Ac− anions in the MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite, and then the dense and uniform MAPbI3 perovskite was finally formed. On the other hand, since it is easy to directly form MAPbI3 perovskite from concurrent MAI + PbI2 in the PbI2·MAI·MAAc precursor solution from the kinetic view of point (Path 2),45 this path cannot be ruled out, that is, the MAPbI3 perovskite phase and the MAPbI3−xAcx intermediate phase may be concurrently formed in the mixed solution.
Due to the fact that the MAPbI3 perovskite formation is accomplished by the evaporation of MAAc, the MAPbI3 perovskite morphology would be strongly influenced by the substrate temperature and the ratio of MAAc in the PbI2·MAI·MAAc precursor. Fig. 3c and d show the atomic force microscopy (AFM) and SEM images of optimized MAPbI3 perovskite with a substrate temperature of 80 °C and a MAAc ratio of 1.5 (PbI2:MAI:MAAc = 1:1:1.5). The pits and ridges with different shapes can be clearly seen in the perovskite film. A number of excellent morphologies of perovskites have emerged until now with varying degrees of surface coverage, crystal size, and film quality. For instance, the extremely uniform and dense perovskite layers by solvent engineering,27 uniform flat films by layer-by-layer growth,46 the cuboid MAPbI3 with controlled size by two-step methods,47 solvent annealing of perovskite-induced big crystal growth,48 and millimeter-scale crystalline grains by hot-casting.13 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to report such a morphology with pits in the surface, which increase the surface area and is much suitable for the charge extraction (discussed below). Moreover, the morphology is rather different from the MAPbI3 perovskite made from the PbI2·MAI precursor without MAAc under the same spin-coating procedure. In this case, the wet film dried slowly and the color of the film on the substrate changed to shiny gray during spin coating as reported in the literature.26,27 The resulting morphology appears as an inhomogeneous needle-like structure with low coverage on the substrate (ESI, Fig. S6†). Most recently, lead(II) acetate trihydrate Pb(Ac)2·3H2O instead of lead chloride or iodide was used as a lead source for the formation of perovskite crystals with ultra-smooth and almost pinhole-free perovskite films.44,49–53 This system is similar to ours with a ratio of MAAc at 2 based on the transition process of Pb(Ac)2 into MAPbI3 perovskite with 2 molar MAAc generated. The formed perovskite morphology was investigated with the same procedure and it was found that it also shows pits on the surface but it is significantly different from ours with a ratio of MAAc at 2 (ESI, Fig. S7†). It may be because of the crystalliferous water in Pb(Ac)2·3H2O, which could be harmful to the perovskite formation in this system. Moreover, the transition from Pb(Ac)2 into MAPbI3 perovskite is not fully completed with clear appearance of PbI2 peaks based on XRD profiles although the film shows characteristic absorption of tetragonal perovskite (ESI, Fig. S8†).
Interestingly, with increasing the temperature the pits are gradually formed at 60 °C and getting more at 100 °C (ESI, Fig. S9†). The size of the pits, however, becomes smaller at a higher temperature of 100 °C (ESI, Fig. S10†). The RMS roughness of MAPbI3 perovskite films was analyzed, as shown in Table S2 (ESI†), where the roughness was gradually reduced with increasing the temperature and then increased with further increasing the temperature. The perovskite film formed on the room temperature substrate gives the highest roughness of 42.2 nm while that formed on the 80 °C substrate shows the roughness of 18.4 nm. We proposed that the evaporation of MAAc may be very slow at room temperature based on the TGA measurement since the driving force for MAAc evaporation is mainly from the vacuum on the top of the substrate by spin rotation. In this case, the MAAc may not escape simultaneously since the rotation speed is different from the center to the edge of the substrate, resulting in different vacuum. At a high temperature (100 °C), however, the evaporation of MAAc is so fast at the same time, which leads to smaller but deeper pit formation. The film, however, looks to be dewetting with further increasing the substrate temperature to 120 °C (ESI, Fig. S11†), which is the reason that the RMS roughness is significantly increased.
The effect of the ratio of MAAc in the PbI2·MAI·MAAc precursor on the perovskite film morphology was also investigated at a fixed substrate temperature of 80 °C (ESI, Fig. S12 and S13†). With increasing the ratio of MAAc from 1 to 3, the number of pits is dramatically increased due to much more MAAc evaporation during spin-coating, which shows the same trends with increasing the temperature. The RMS roughness is given in Table S2 (ESI†), where the roughness was significantly reduced from 44.8 nm at the ratios of 1 to 18.4 nm and 28.7 nm with increasing the ratio to 1.5 and 2, respectively, and then further increased to 56.6 nm at the ratio of 3. This obviously shows that the roughness can be better controlled at a ratio of MAAc at 1.5 and 2 in the precursor at a substrate temperature of 80 °C, which originates from the desired evaporation of MAAc. The homogeneous distribution of pits in diameter was obtained for the low substrate temperature and low ratios of MAAc while high substrate temperatures and high ratios gave non-uniformly shaped pits which are even sometimes hard to be defined as pits.
The above-mentioned results have clearly demonstrated that the management of perovskite intermediate phases with an appropriate MAAc concentration is an effective approach to construct a high-quality MAPbI3 film with pits on the surface. MAAc has two functions in our system: one is the reaction of MAAc with PbI2 forming the MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite intermediate phase and the other is the evaporation of MAAc to leave pits on the perovskite surface. It seems that the MAAc in precursor solution with a concentration of 1.5 mol L−1 and a substrate temperature of 80 °C could allow the appropriate morphology of MAPbI3 perovskite films. The final solar cell structure was completed by spin-coating electron-transporting layer PCBM and interface layer FPI-PEIE fulleropyrrolidinium iodide (Bis-OMe FPI) doped with ethoxylated polyethyleneimine (PEIE) by anion-induced electron transfer,54 and thermal evaporation of Ag, as shown in Fig. 4a. The FPI-PEIE exhibits high conductivity and work function tunability,54 which shows matching energy levels with PCBM, as shown in Fig. 4b. Moreover, the interface of PCBM and Ag can be further modified for better charge collection. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are respectively plotted in Fig. 4c. The best PCE of 18.09% was achieved with the Voc, Jsc, and FF determined to be 1.00 V, 22.90 mA cm−2, and 0.79, and among the top PCEs reported to date for inverted planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells with PEDOT:PSS/PCBM charge-transporting layers (ESI, Table S3†). Moreover, over 90% incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was obtained, as shown in Fig. 4d. The performances of devices based on various substrate temperatures and ratios of MAAc in the precursor are shown in Fig. S14 and S15 (ESI†). For comparison, we fabricated a device by one-step solution casting a mixture of Pb(Ac)2·3H2O and MAI (1:3 mol mol−1) in DMF according to reported procedures,47 and found very poor device performance with the best Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE values of 0.96 V, 19.32 mA cm−2, 0.58, and 10.76%, respectively (Fig. 4c). The PCE is even 1.7 times lower than that in our approach. The poor performance of devices based on Pb(Ac)2·3H2O·3MAI precursor solution may be attributed to the hydration water.55 Therefore, the device based on Pb(Ac)2 as the lead source was fabricated. To generate the Pb(Ac)2·3MAI precursor solution, the Pb(Ac)2·3H2O was first heated to 90 °C in the vacuum oven overnight to release the hydration water. The best PCE of a device based on Pb(Ac)2·3MAI precursor solution was 14.61%, which is better than that of the device fabricated from the Pb(Ac)2·3H2O·3MAI precursor solution but still lower than that of the device fabricated from the PbI2·MAI·1.5MAAc precursor solution. The detailed statistical results of photovoltaic parameters of these devices are shown in Table 1. The enhancement of PCE is due to the improved parameters Jsc, FF, and Voc, which is consistent with the improved structural and electro-optical properties of the MAPbI3 perovskite films from the PbI2·MAI·1.5MAAc precursor in comparison with that from the Pb(Ac)2·3H2O·3MAI and Pb(Ac)2·3MAI precursor. (1) As we know, a densely pinhole-free planar film can improve the interfacial contact between the active layer and electrode and charge transport, compared to a planar film with pinholes.56 The high Jsc in the devices can be attributed to the pits in the perovskite film surface because of the fact that some nanostructures have been already explored in polymer solar cells for effective charge extraction or scattering-induced light trapping.57,58 We believe that the primary benefit of growing perovskites with pits in the surface is that the increased surface area (like a 3D structure) facilitates charge extraction, reduces charge recombination, and suppresses charge trapping, allowing for the photogenerated carriers to be effectively extracted across the MAPbI3/PCBM interface without accumulation. The crystallite size (∼160 nm in average) is commensurate with the electron–hole diffusion lengths in MAPbI3,8 which ensures a high level of carrier extraction from the perovskite film.17 More importantly, the balanced charge carrier transport can significantly reduce the leak current. (2) The high FF could originate from balanced holes and electron transport. In order to demonstrate this, we fabricated electron-only and hole-only devices (Fig. 4e). The two devices exhibited almost the same current density, indicating the balanced charge carrier transport. (3) The high Voc could stem from the improved perovskite morphology, which reduced leakage current and induced recombination. In addition to the high performance, we found that the solar cell device performance was hysteresis free with the direction of voltage sweep (Fig. 4f). This also indicates that the efficiencies measured for our perovskite solar cells with stable J–V curves are reliable. The hysteresis-free characteristics of our devices can be attributed to low bulk/surface defect densities of the compact perovskite films. A possible contribution from the good interfaces between the perovskite films and charge-transporting layers (i.e., PEDOT:PSS, PCBM) cannot be ruled out as our previous report,46 and Xiao et al.48 have also reported recently hysteresis-free devices based on the same charge-transporting layers of PEDOT:PSS and PCBM.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a facile but efficient technology by managing perovskite intermediates for the deposition of uniform perovskite layers with controlled morphology, and demonstrated a solution-processed 18.09% perovskite solar cell with organic charge transporting layers under standard conditions (AM1.5 G irradiation, 100 mW cm−2). The observed superb device performances are attributable to the controlled pit-based perovskite films with enhanced charge extraction and balanced charge transport. The film morphology can be tunable by changing the substrate temperature and the ratio of MAAc in the precursor solution. The formation of an unstable MAPbI3−xAcx perovskite intermediate phase via an intercalation process was analyzed in detail, which enabled the formation of highly dense perovskite films. Further enhancements in efficiency can be expected by forming large crystal grains with pit-based perovskite morphologies for solar cells. This work represents a breakthrough in developing highly efficient perovskite optoelectronics of practical significance.
