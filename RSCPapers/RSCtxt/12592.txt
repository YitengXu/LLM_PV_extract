1. Introduction
Energy shortage, environmental pollution and global warming have brought about tough challenges for the sustainable development of human society. To solve these problems, it is imperative to explore and use clean, renewable and sustainable energy sources. Fuel cells which use hydrogen as fuel to replace fossil fuels offer an ideal strategy to supply clean power sources, which has great potential to alleviate the energy and environmental problems.1–5 Although hydrogen is recognized as a promising clean energy source and can be produced by a number of methods such as photocatalysis and electrocatalytic water splitting,6–11 its transportation and storage are challenging due to its safety issues and gas status which generally requires high pressure to liquidize it. Therefore, the development and utilization of more efficient and safe hydrogen storage materials have attracted tremendous research interest.
Based on the pathways of hydrogen charging and discharging, the hydrogen storage materials can be divided into physical storage materials and chemical storage materials.12 Among them, the hydrogen content of the chemical hydrogen storage materials is much higher than that of physical hydrogen storage materials, and thus the chemical hydrogen storage materials are recognized as an ideal candidate for efficient hydrogen storage.13 However, for practical applications, the charging and discharging of H2 through chemical storage materials under mild conditions are highly demanded. While there are relatively high energy barriers that need to be overcome, catalysts, especially nanocatalysts, can significantly lower the activation energy to realize efficient release of hydrogen under mild conditions. Therefore, the design and synthesis of high performance catalysts become the key to facilitating the applications of chemical hydrogen storage materials for hydrogen production.14
Among the various chemical hydrogen storage materials, nitrogen–hydrogen compounds and borohydride compounds have been widely studied in recent years because of the merits of high hydrogen content, low by-product production, easy transportation at room temperature, etc.14–16 Hydrazine (N2H4) is an important nitrogen–hydrogen compound which has a hydrogen content as high as 12.5 wt%.17 With the development of high-performance catalysts such as Shell 405 (30 wt% Ir/Al2O3),18,19 hydrazine can be decomposed rapidly to produce a large amount of hydrogen gas and heat. Therefore, hydrazine has been widely applied in aerospace as a small-orientation engine control propellant. At that time, a number of reports also indicated that some transition metal carbides,20–22 nitrides,23–25 or phosphides26,27 also exhibited precious metal-like properties, which can be used as catalysts to decompose hydrazine at a much lower cost.
The decomposition of hydrazine includes complete decomposition (eqn (1)) and incomplete decomposition (eqn (2)), which proceed through four sub-pathways (Scheme 1a).14 N2H4 → N2(g) + 2H2(g), ΔH = −95.4 kJ mol−1(1) 3N2H4 → 4NH3(g) + N2(g), ΔH = −157 kJ mol−1(2)

Decomposition of hydrazine to generate NH3 (pathway 2) is a thermodynamically favorable reaction. The decomposition reaction is also affected by the applied catalysts and reaction conditions (such as temperature and pressure).28–34 The formation of ammonia generally takes place during the hydrazine decomposition, which results in less hydrogen production.24,35–37
Complete decomposition of hydrazine to N2 and H2 (pathway 1) is more desirable for practical applications. To realize this, the sequence of N–N and N–H bond cleavage needs to be managed. As shown in Scheme 1b, it is proposed that the initial step for complete decomposition of hydrazine is the coordination of hydrazine molecules with the catalyst surface.30,38–41 The second step is N–H bond cleavage rather than N–N bond cleavage. However, from the thermodynamic viewpoint, the N–N bond cleavage is easier compared to N–H bond cleavage due to its lower bond cleavage energy (286 kJ mol−1 for N–N bond and 360 kJ mol−1 for N–H bond cleavage) which will lead to the formation of N2 and NH3. The catalyst plays a key role in lowering the energy barrier of N–H cleavage. Some research studies indicate that strong metal–H bonds (M–H) can facilitate the cleavage of N–H bonds.29,33 For example, because the Pt–H bond is stronger than Pt–N, the energy barrier of N–H cleavage becomes lower than that of N–N cleavage.33 Then the formed M–H, and H2N–NH2, HN–NH2, HNNH and NN–H bonded with the metal surface lead to the production of N2 and H2 when N–H bond cleavage is solely activated.
Explosion is one of the most serious hazards of hydrazine, especially when it is in contact with metal catalysts. Hydrous hydrazine (N2H4·H2O) is much safer than pure hydrazine,28 and it can also be completely decomposed into N2 and H2. Although the water molecules do not participate in the decomposition reaction, the hydrogen content of hydrous hydrazine is still as high as 8.0%.15 In addition, because of the hydrogen bonds between hydrazine and water molecules, the chemical stability of hydrous hydrazine is better. Therefore compared to pure hydrazine, hydrous hydrazine is more suitable as a liquid hydrogen source. However, due to the existence of hydrogen bonds, hydrous hydrazine is relatively difficult to decompose under mild conditions. In addition, the constant accumulation of water during decomposition could give rise to a continuous decrease in the activity of catalysts.42,43
Therefore, to facilitate the real-world applications of hydrous hydrazine as a liquid hydrogen source, two major issues need to be solved. On the one hand, it is imperative to enhance the activity of catalysts; on the other hand, it is more important to ensure the complete decomposition of hydrous hydrazine, i.e. increase the hydrogen selectivity to maximize the hydrogen production and minimize the by-product production. In the past few decades, great progress has been achieved in the preparation of highly efficient nanocatalysts for hydrogen generation by decomposition of hydrous hydrazine.14,44 These catalysts can be classified into nano-metallic catalysts, complex metal–metal oxide catalysts, supported catalysts, etc.
2. Catalysts for hydrous hydrazine decomposition
2.1 Monometallic nanoparticle catalysts
Metallic nanocatalysts are widely applied in catalytic decomposition of hydrous hydrazine. Xu and co-workers initially investigated various metal (Rh, Co, Ru, Ir, Cu, Ni, Fe, Pt and Pd) nanoparticles (NPs) as catalysts for hydrazine decomposition at room temperature.45 Among the various NPs examined, the Rh NPs with a size of 16 nm possessed the highest hydrogen selective (43.8%), while the Co, Ru and Ir NPs only exhibited ∼7% selectivity for hydrogen production under the same reaction conditions (Fig. 1). The other metal NPs, Cu, Ni, Fe, Pt and Pd, were found to be inactive for catalytic decomposition of hydrous hydrazine. However, they were active in gas-phase catalytic decomposition of hydrazine,29 which proved that the presence of water significantly impacted the activity and selectivity of the catalysts, because the energy barrier of decomposition of hydrazine was increased due to the hydrogen bonds between water and hydrazine molecules. It was found that during the synthesis of Rh, Co, Ru and Ir nanocatalysts, surfactants played key roles in controlling the sizes of the catalysts. For example, the reduction of aqueous Rh(NO3)3 with NaBH4 in the presence of hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) resulted in the formation of Rh NPs with a smaller size (∼5 nm), which contributed to a larger surface area, leading to a 3 times higher catalytic activity.45

The upper inset is a TEM image of Rh NPs and the corresponding SAED pattern. Scale bar is 20 nm. Reprinted from ref. 45 with permission from the American Chemical Society. 
The reaction temperature is one of the major factors that affects the catalytic activity and selectivity. A typical example was Ni NPs, which have no catalytic activity for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at room temperature, but showed dramatically enhanced catalytic activity with a hydrogen selectivity of 33% when the reaction temperature was increased to 323 K. However, no further increase in hydrogen selectivity was observed when the reaction temperature was further increased to 343 K, whereas the reaction completion time was significantly reduced.46 In another study, it was found that the increase of reaction temperature has a negative effect on the catalytic performance of Rh NPs.47 The hydrogen selectivity was 43.8% at room temperature, but it decreased to 34% when the reaction temperature was increased to 343 K. It can be seen that the increase of reaction temperature can enhance the catalytic activity, but the effect on hydrogen selectivity varied based on the applied catalysts.
Adding NaOH to hydrous hydrazine is an effective strategy to promote the hydrogen selectivity. Wang and co-workers reported that by increasing the reaction temperature (343 K) and adding NaOH (0.50–1.00 M), unsupported Ni NPs showed a hydrogen selectivity of 100%.48 OH− could suppress the formation of NH3 in the hydrazine solution during decomposition, while the rate-determining deprotonation step (N2H4 → N2H3* + H*) of hydrazine decomposition could also be accelerated by the increase of OH−.49 Therefore adding NaOH is able to promote the hydrogen selectivity during hydrous hydrazine decomposition.48–50

2.2 Bimetallic NP catalysts
One of the most effective strategies to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity of metallic catalysts is to introduce a second metallic component to form a bimetallic nanocatalyst.14 The bimetallic system generally possesses superior catalytic activities to that of the monometallic counterparts due to the synergistic effects of the two metals. This effect is originated from the change in surface electronic states and geometric structures, as well as the local strain and effective atomic coordination number at the surface.52–64 The strong metal–metal interactions in the bimetallic system are able to tune the bonding between the reactants and the catalyst surfaces, thereby stabilizing the transition state and reaction intermediates, leading to an increase of catalytic activity and selectivity.14,15,65,66 When the size of a catalyst is on the nanometer scale, the impact of these effects becomes particularly significant.
Bimetallic NPs can be divided into the following groups: (a) bimetallic NPs combining two noble metals, (b) bimetallic NPs involving noble and non-noble metals, and (c) noble metal free bimetallic NPs.

2.2.1 Bimetallic catalysts combining two noble metals. 
Changing the configuration of bimetallic nanocatalysts may offer an important strategy to improve their catalytic performance. For example, Xia and co-workers synthesized Pd–Ir bimetallic nanostructures in the forms of core–shell octopods and alloyed nanocages and investigated their catalytic performances (Fig. 2).67 The success of this facile synthesis relied on the use of Pd nanocubes as the sacrificial templates. The Pd–Ir alloy nanocages with a size of 25 nm exhibited better selectivity (66%) for hydrogen generation than the Pd–Ir octopods (20 nm, 29%) at room temperature. This may be due to the fact that single Ir dominated the surface area of the core–shell octopods, whereas Pd and Ir coexisted on the surface of the alloy nanocages, i.e., an alloyed porous structure existed on the surface of the alloyed nanocages. Meanwhile, 18 nm Pd nanocubes were also investigated for the catalytic decomposition of hydrous hydrazine, and no gas was generated, which indicated that Pd was inactive. In addition, the authors also evaluated the catalytic performance of 14 nm Pd–Ir alloyed nanocages, which showed a faster decomposition rate than the 25 nm alloyed nanocages. The reason was that the smaller Pd–Ir alloyed nanocages had a larger surface area. However, the hydrogen selectivity of these small alloyed nanocages was similar to that of the large ones (∼67%), indicating that the surface configuration of the bimetallic catalyst mainly affected the catalytic selectivity, while the surface area impacted the catalytic activity.

2.2.2 Bimetallic catalysts combining noble metal and non-noble metal. 
Ni–Rh nanocatalysts. 
A series of bimetallic Ni–Rh nanocatalysts were prepared using a co-reduction method in the presence of hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB).68 The resultant NixRhy nanocatalysts with various compositions were denoted as NiRh64, NiRh16, NiRh8, NiRh4, NiRh3, NiRh, Ni4Rh, Ni8Rh and Ni16Rh (Fig. 3a). It was found that the hydrogen selectivity strongly depended on the Ni/Rh ratio (Fig. 3b). Although Ni itself was inactive to the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine and Rh itself had a low hydrogen selectivity, the alloy of Ni–Rh was able to drastically enhance the hydrogen selectivity and reached a maximum of 100% at Ni/Rh = 1:4 (NiRh4), indicating that hydrous hydrazine can be completely converted into hydrogen and nitrogen at room temperature. However, if the content of Rh was further increased, hydrogen selectivity gradually decreased and eventually remained at ∼43%. For comparison, if the Ni and Rh NPs were physically mixed, no significant effect on the hydrogen selectivity was observed. Therefore, the formation of a Ni and Rh alloy is a prerequisite for improving the hydrogen selectivity. The alloy of Ni and Rh led to the modification of the catalyst surfaces, and the interactions between Rh and N–N bonds, and Rh and N–H bonds were adjusted. The stability of the reaction intermediate was affected, so the decomposition reaction was more prone to the breakage of the N–H bond, rather than the N–N bond, which led the reaction to follow pathway (1), allowing the complete conversion of hydrous hydrazine into nitrogen and hydrogen.68 Similar results were observed in other studies,69 in which different synthetic methods were utilized to prepare Ni–Rh bimetallic NPs by spontaneous alloying of well-dispersed Ni–Rh NPs. The hydrogen selectivity of the NiRh4 nanocatalyst was up to 100% at room temperature.

Similar to mono-metal catalysts, a significant enhancement in the catalytic performance of bimetal catalysts was observed when the reaction temperature was increased. For example, the effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of Ni–Rh bimetallic nanocatalysts was investigated by Xu and co-workers.47 It was found that reaction temperature played a crucial role in the catalytic performance of Ni–Rh bimetallic nanocatalysts. For instance, the Ni90Rh10 nanocatalyst showed only 28% hydrogen selectivity at room temperature, but 100% hydrogen selectivity when the reaction temperature was raised to 323 K (Fig. 4). At room temperature, to reach a hydrogen selectivity of 100%, the content of Rh was required to be 80%. This finding offered an important pathway to improve the hydrogen selectivity of Rh–Ni catalysts, especially the ones with a low Rh content.

Based on Ni–Rh bimetallic nanocatalysts, non-metal element B was doped to synthesize Ni–Rh–B NP catalysts.70 In the presence of NaOH, the resultant catalysts showed 100% hydrogen selectivity and an excellent catalytic activity in the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at room temperature. The excellent catalytic performance was attributed to the combined effects of boron-doping and alkaline (NaOH) promotion. It was also showed that KOH also has a similar positive effect, indicating that the promoting role of alkaline is general.
Ni–Ir nanocatalysts. 
Although Ir is an excellent catalyst for decomposing hydrazine and hydrous hydrazine, there are not many research reports on Ni–Ir bimetallic nanocatalysts for hydrous hydrazine decomposition. However, it is found that even a very low content of Ir in the Ni–Ir nanocatalyst could give rise to excellent catalytic performance.71,72
Xu and co-workers synthesized a series of Ni–Ir nanocatalysts by co-reduction of Ni2+ and Ir4+ metal ions in an aqueous solution in the presence of CTAB and CTAC as stabilizers.71 NixIr1−x-B and NixIr1−x-C with different Ir contents (1–75 mol%) represented the Ni–Ir nanocatalysts obtained in the presence of CTAB and CTAC, respectively. The Ni–Ir–B nanocatalysts with 5–10 mol% Ir content showed 100% hydrogen selectivity at 298 K. The reaction completion times of Ni0.95Ir0.05-B and Ni0.95Ir0.05-C were 390 min and 440 min, respectively, which demonstrated that the nanocatalyst synthesized using CTAB had a better catalytic activity. However, when the Ir content was increased above 25 mol% or reduced to 1 mol%, the hydrogen selectivity decreased to 85.5% and 76%, respectively (Fig. 5). At the same time, it was found that the use of surfactants could prevent the agglomeration of nanocatalysts, thus providing sufficient surface sites to interact with hydrazine, and enhance the activity (under the same conditions, the reaction without surfactants took 18 h to complete).

Ni–Pt nanocatalysts. 
It is interesting that although single Ni and Pt are inactive for hydrous hydrazine decomposition, Ni–Pt bimetallic catalysts generally show excellent catalytic activity and hydrogen selectivity (Table 2).46,50,73–75 Therefore a Ni–Pt bimetallic NP catalyst is a kind of special catalyst that combines two inactive components to achieve a high catalytic activity.

Ni–Pt bimetallic nanocatalysts with different Pt contents were synthesized by co-reduction of the corresponding metal chlorides.73 With a Pt content of 7–31 mol%, the Ni–Pt nanocatalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity in the decomposition of hydrazine in aqueous solution, producing hydrogen with 100% selectivity at room temperature. The hydrogen selectivity slightly decreased to 81% when the Pt content was reduced to 3 mol%. When the Pt content was increased to 74 mol%, the hydrogen selectivity dropped drastically to 28% (Fig. 6).

Reprinted from ref. 73 with permission from the American Chemical Society. 
Later, Xu and co-workers synthesized surfactant-free Ni–Pt bimetallic nanocatalysts using NaBH4 as a reducing agent in the presence of NaOH. The obtained Ni–Pt nanocatalyst had a very small size of 2.4 nm and was dispersed well in the solution.74 The obtained catalysts could catalyze the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at room temperature. It was found that the hydrogen selectivity and catalytic activity of the catalyst depended on the ratio of Ni/Pt. When the Pt content was in a range of 10–80 mol%, the catalyst showed 100% hydrogen selectivity at room temperature, which was better than that achieved in a previous study.73 This indicated that the synthetic process could remarkably affect the catalytic performance of the obtained catalysts. Among the synthesized catalysts, the Ni60Pt40-SF-I (SF represents surfactant) catalyst showed the best catalytic performance and extremely high hydrogen selectivity at 298 K (metal/N2H4 = 1:10). The reaction completion time was 10 min and the corresponding TOF was 150 h−1. NaOH played an important role in the formation of highly dispersed Ni–Pt NPs. The underlying mechanism was that the addition of NaOH slowed the reduction rate, thereby inhibiting the growth of nuclei. The negative charge of OH− might prevent the aggregation of NPs. In the absence of NaOH, the reduction rate and the growth rate of nuclei were very fast, resulting in the aggregation of NPs.
It is possible to achieve 100% hydrogen selectivity with a very low Pt content (e.g. 1 mol%) in Ni–Pt nanocatalysts (Fig. 7a and b) by raising the reaction temperature to 323 K (Fig. 7c),46 which was similar to Ni–Rh bimetallic NP catalysts.47 The addition of NaOH could also improve the hydrogen selectivity. For example, adding 0.5 M NaOH could increase the hydrogen selectivity of the Ni45Pt55 nanocatalyst from 61% to 86% at 298 K.50

Ni–Pd nanocatalysts. 
Xu and co-workers synthesized Ni–Pd bimetallic NP catalysts (Ni1−xPdx) by alloying Ni and Pd with various Pd contents (x = 0.20–0.90).76 Compared to the poor catalytic performance of monometallic NPs (Ni, the hydrogen selectivity was 33%; Pd, no catalytic activity), Ni–Pd bimetallic NP catalysts showed a much better catalytic performance due to the coexistence of two metals on the surface and the existence of inter-metallic Ni–Pd bonds. The results showed that the hydrogen selectivity of the Ni1−xPdx bimetallic NP catalyst was 79–82% at 323 K when x = 0.35–0.45, while the catalytic performance of Ni0.60Pd0.40 exhibited the highest hydrogen selectivity of ∼82%. However, further increase in the content of Ni or Pd would lead to the decrease of hydrogen selectivity. The hydrogen selectivity decreased to ∼56% and ∼33% when x = 0.20 and 0.90, respectively. Lowering the reaction temperature negatively affected the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine. The hydrogen selectivity of Ni0.60Pd0.40 was only ∼7% at 298 K. When the reaction temperature was increased above 323 K, the hydrogen selectivity didn't increase further; however the reaction completion time decreased.
Later, with a simple room temperature method, Bhattacharjee and co-workers prepared Ni–Pd bimetallic nanocatalysts (Ni content was 50–80%) by surfactant assisted co-reduction of hydroxides of Pd2+ and Ni2+.77 Due to its large specific surface area, the synthesized catalyst showed a superior catalytic performance in the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine to that in previous reports. By investigating a series of NixPd100−x bimetallic NP catalysts with different Ni contents (x = 50–80), it was found that Ni60Pd40 possessed the best catalytic performance. The hydrogen selectivity at 298 K was 85%, while the hydrogen selectivity of Ni50Pd50, Ni70Pd30 and Ni80Pd20 was 70%, 71% and 29%, respectively (Fig. 8). Meanwhile, in order to achieve better hydrogen selectivity at room temperature, NaOH was added to the hydrous hydrazine. The hydrogen selectivity of Ni60Pd40 reached 100% by adding 0.4 M NaOH.

Fe, Co and Cu based nanocatalysts. 
The bimetallic nanocatalyst formed by combination of Ni and noble metals (Rh, Ir, Pt and Pd) can achieve high selectivity for hydrogen production from hydrous hydrazine decomposition. The formation of alloy nanocatalysts from these noble metals and Ni is one of the hot topics in this field. However, in contrast, bimetallic NP catalysts formed between noble metals and Fe, Co or Cu have negative effects on catalytic performance.
Co–Ir, Co–Pd and Co–Rh nanocatalysts. 
There are a few reports on the study of Co-based bimetallic NP catalysts. The hydrogen selectivity of Co0.95Ir0.05 was only 7% at 298 K,71 which was consistent with that of the Co–Pd (Co0.60Pd0.40) bimetallic NP catalyst at 323 K.76 The hydrogen selectivities of the Co–Pt nanocatalyst (Co0.77Pt0.23)73 and Co–Rh nanocatalyst (CoRh4)68 were 20% and 21.1%, respectively. Therefore, it seems that the bimetallic NPs composed of Co and noble metals are not ideal catalysts for hydrous hydrogen decomposition.
Fe–Ir, Fe–Pt, Fe–Pd and Fe–Rh nanocatalysts. 
A systematic study of Fe-based nanocatalysts revealed that they were not stable. These nanocatalysts generally exhibit low catalytic activity in the process of hydrogen production from hydrous hydrazine decomposition. Fe–Ir (Fe0.95Ir0.05)71 and Fe–Pt (Fe0.77Pt0.23)73 bimetallic NP catalysts showed little catalytic activity at 298 K. At 323 K, the Fe–Pd (Fe0.60Pd0.40) bimetallic NP catalyst was also inactive.76 Only Fe–Rh (FeRh4)68 nanocatalysts were able to catalyze the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at 298 K, but the hydrogen selectivity was only 30.0%, which was even lower than that of Rh monometallic NPs.68
Cu-based nanocatalysts. 
Cu-based bimetallic NP catalysts were found to be inactive for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine. Even when Cu was combined with active metals such as Rh and Ir, no active catalysts were generated. For instance, neither CuRh4 (ref. 68) nor Cu0.95Ir0.05 (ref. 71) was active for the decomposition reaction of hydrous hydrazine. Moreover, in contrast to the high activities of the nanocatalysts prepared by alloying Ni with inactive Pt or Pd, no improvements were observed for the ones synthesized via alloying Cu with Pt or Pd. Neither Cu0.77Pt0.23 (ref. 73) at 298 K nor Cu0.60Pd0.40 (ref. 76) at 323 K was active for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine. It is worth mentioning that Cu monometallic NP catalysts are also inactive for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine.45


2.2.3 Noble metal free bimetallic nanocatalysts. 
Ni–M (M = Fe, Co, Cu and B) nanocatalysts. 
Since noble metals such as Rh, Ir and Pt are expensive, noble-metal-free nanocatalysts were developed for the economic advantage, which is crucial for facilitating the potential applications of hydrous hydrazine as a hydrogen storage material. Ni-based bimetallic nanocatalysts such as Ni–Fe, Ni–Co, Ni–Cu and Ni–B were intensively studied. The synergistic effects and electron transfer between metals in noble-metal-free bimetallic NPs can enhance the activity in the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine.
Xu and co-workers synthesized bimetallic Ni–Fe NPs with an average size of 10 nm by a surfactant-assisted co-reduction method.50 It was found that none of the Ni–Fe NP catalysts were active for the decomposition reaction of hydrous hydrazine at 298 K. But when the reaction temperature was increased to 343 K, the Ni0.50Fe0.50 nanocatalyst exhibited 81% hydrogen selectivity without NaOH, indicating the key role of temperature in activating the decomposition reaction (Fig. 9a). In that case, adding NaOH could significantly enhance the hydrogen selectivity. In the presence of NaOH (0.5 M), the hydrogen selectivities of the Ni0.50Fe0.50 NP catalyst were 80% and 100% at 323 K and 343 K, respectively. For comparison, Ni–Co and Ni–Cu bimetallic NPs were also synthesized. However the obtained Ni–Co and Ni–Cu bimetallic NP catalysts showed only ∼18% and ∼15% hydrogen selectivity under analogous reaction conditions respectively, much lower than that of Ni–Fe nanocatalysts (Fig. 9b). It was proposed that the alloy of Ni and Fe gave rise to a modification of the catalyst surface through incorporation of considerable intermetallic electronic interactions. Therefore, the presence of both Ni and Fe on the catalyst surface significantly adjusted the interactions between the catalyst surface and the hydrazine bonds as well as the stability of the reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface.50 As a result, the Ni–Fe catalyst surface facilitated the activation of hydrazine preferentially by pathway (1) over pathway (2) for its complete decomposition to hydrogen and nitrogen.14,50 These results further supported that introduction of a second component could lead to a special surface structure and composition which governed the catalytic performance. It was noticed that adding weaker alkali (e.g., NH3 and CH3COONa) had no effect on the catalytic performance of the Ni–Fe NP catalysts. Presumably, only highly alkaline reaction conditions can make the catalyst surface highly basic, which was unfavorable for the formation of basic NH3 and hindered the decomposition of hydrazine to ammonia.

Following Xu's experimental studies on the Ni–Fe alloy for hydrous hydrazine decomposition, Wu and co-workers applied density functional theory (DFT) to theoretically study the interaction energy of adsorbent–adsorbate and the energy barrier of N–N bond breaking on the Ni–Fe alloy surface with various molar ratios, including Fe3Ni(111), FeNi(111), and FeNi3(111).78 It was found that the ratio of Ni to Fe atoms on the (111) surface significantly impacted not only the geometries and strengths of adsorption of hydrazine and NH2 fragments but also the reaction energy barriers. Among them, the FeNi3(111) surface provided the strongest binding between the hydrazine and iron atoms, while the Fe3Ni(111) surface offered the strongest binding between the NH2 fragment and the iron atoms. The FeNi(111) surface was able to strongly adsorb both hydrazine and NH2 fragments. The energy barriers of the first dissociation step of hydrazine on the above three alloy surfaces were also calculated (Fig. 10). On the Fe3Ni(111) surface, the highest reaction energy of 1.47 eV was released during the first hydrazine dissociation step, while FeNi(111) showed the lowest energy barrier of 0.15 eV. The FeNi3(111) surface was exothermic by only −0.95 eV for the first hydrazine dissociation step, but had an activation energy barrier of 0.68 eV. This theoretical research is helpful for the design of an effective catalyst surface for hydrous hydrazine decomposition.

Ni2B, another noble metal free, Ni-based bimetallic nanocatalyst, has been studied. Tong and co-workers synthesized urchin-like Ni2B alloy catalysts with a mesoporous structure by a solution plasma process (SPP).79 Ni(NH3)62+ and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were used as raw materials. Due to the high surface area of active species nickel and the enhanced intrinsic activity of the urchin structure, the performance of Ni–B urchins was superior to those of RANEY® Ni and conventional Ni–B during hydrous hydrazine decomposition. The hydrogen selectivity of the urchin-like amorphous Ni2B catalyst was 90.0% with the addition of NaOH at room temperature. In contrast, the hydrogen selectivity of conventional Ni2B catalysts was 72.0% under the same reaction conditions.
Co–B monodisperse spherical NPs and honeycomb-like alloy nanocatalysts were synthesized and studied by the same research group.80,81 Both of the Co–B nanocatalysts were amorphous. The catalytic tests showed that the Co–B nanocatalysts possessed an almost constant activity with the progress of the reaction. Compared to conventional Co–B catalysts, the Co–B-0.5-0.01 amorphous catalyst showed a much higher catalytic activity and better hydrogen selectivity at room temperature. The high catalytic activity of Co–B amorphous nanocatalysts could be attributed to their high active surface area. These amorphous Co–B catalysts could have a certain catalytic activity even at higher concentrations of hydrazine. The honeycomb like Co–B catalyst showed a higher hydrogen selectivity in a further study.81 The hydrogen selectivity was 41.8%, compared to 8.7% and 21.3% for the Co–B conventional catalyst and Co–B spherical catalysts.

2.3 Trimetallic NP catalysts
In a previous study of bimetallic NP catalysts, it was found that noble-metal-free bimetallic nanocatalysts, Ni–Fe NPs, have shown excellent catalytic performance. Therefore, based on the study of Ni–Fe bimetallic NPs, incorporation of a third metal to form a trimetallic NP catalyst was intensively investigated in order to achieve a better catalytic performance.
Noble-metal-free Ni–Fe–Mo NP catalysts have been synthesized through a facile one-step synthetic route at room temperature under an ambient atmosphere.82 The as-prepared NPs had a small particle size (<5 nm) and high dispersibility even without the assistance of surfactants or supports (Fig. 11). The addition of Mo resulted in a smaller size of Ni–Fe–Mo NP catalysts. The Ni0.6Fe0.4Mo nanocatalyst achieved 100% hydrogen selectivity and superior catalytic activity in the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at 323 K. Mo acted as an electron donor for Ni and Fe atoms, which transformed Ni–Fe–Mo NP catalyst to endow itself with high catalytic activity for hydrogen generation from hydrous hydrazine decomposition. It was found that the hydrogen selectivity of Ni1−yFeyMo NP catalysts was increased with the increase of the molar ratio of Fe/Ni.

Ni–Fe–Pd NP catalysts are trimetallic nanocatalysts which involve noble metals. Dasgupta and co-workers synthesized Ni–Fe–Pd NPs with various compositions (NixFexPd100−x, x = 25, 30, 35, 40, 45) by a simple co-reduction route at room temperature.83 These unsupported nanocatalysts could decompose hydrous hydrazine at room temperature. The hydrogen selectivity of Ni30Fe30Pd40, Ni35Fe35Pd30 and Ni40Fe40Pd20 reached ∼100% at 298 K. Among them, the Ni30Fe30Pd40 NP catalyst exhibited the best reaction rate at 318 K.
It has been reported that Cu may “accelerate” the catalytic performance of Ni in water gas shift reactions. Based on this idea, noble metal-free Ni–Fe/Cu NP catalysts were synthesized by a two-step synthetic route.84 The Cu core showed little selectivity for hydrazine decomposition, while the Ni–Fe/Cu NP catalyst became highly active and selective for hydrogen production at 315–343 K. The catalytic performance of these catalysts depended on the structure of the Ni–Fe layer, which might be controlled by changing the Ni–Fe/Cu ratio (x). Judging from the catalytic activity and selectivity of mono-, bi- and tri-metallic catalysts, it was reasonable to conclude that the Ni–Fe alloy could be responsible for the selective decomposition of hydrous hydrazine, while the main active metal was Ni. The alloy of Ni and Fe, together with a good dispersion on Cu NPs, remarkably promoted the catalytic activity and hydrogen selectivity during hydrous hydrazine decomposition. NiFe/Cu (the mass ratio x = 1) showed high activity, stability and ∼100% hydrogen selectivity at 300–340 K. Catalysts with x = 1.5 exhibited the lowest activity and selectivity. The effect of temperature on the catalytic activity and selectivity of NiFe/Cu catalysts with x = 1 was studied. The results showed that the hydrogen selectivity decreased significantly as the reaction temperature decreased, and no significant activity was detected below 310 K.
Zhang and co-workers synthesized Cu@Fe5Ni5 core–shell NP catalysts and investigated their catalytic performance.85 The core–shell Cu@Fe5Ni5 NPs have a small size of about 8.5 nm. The catalysts possessed 100% hydrogen selectivity, excellent activity and stability for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine (Fig. 12), which was due to the synergistic effect of the core–shell structure. Since the interaction between the chemical reactants and the catalyst surface controls the catalytic activity and the reaction efficiency, the precise modification of the catalyst surface at the atomic level and the incorporation of intermetallic electronic interactions are important strategies to optimize the catalytic performance. The alloy of Fe and Ni is essential for the complete decomposition of hydrous hydrazine. Therefore, for Cu@Fe5Ni5 NP catalysts, the introduction of Cu cores did not affect the binding effect of Fe and Ni. However Cu is able to act as an electron donor for the catalyst surface, making hydrazine easier to activate. The study of M@FexNi10−x (M = Ir, Pt, Pd, Cu and Ru) core–shell nanocatalysts showed that regardless of the core metal (except for Cu@Fe9Ni1), if the shell was Fe–Ni, the hydrogen selectivity increased with increasing the molar ratio of Fe/Ni. In contrast, all the prepared nanocatalysts only containing Fe shells showed no activity for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine. The study also found that the introduction of noble metals instead of Cu could lead to higher catalytic efficiency, among which Pt@Fe9Ni1 showed the highest catalytic performance.

2.4 Complex oxide catalysts
In general, metal oxides such as L2O3, CeO2, TiO2, Al2O3, MgO, etc., interact strongly with active metal elements such as nickel, palladium and platinum, thus enhancing their catalytic performance through the effect of strong metal–support interaction (SMSI). Huang and co-workers developed a facile approach to modify Ni NPs by creating Ni–CeO2 interactions, which altered the chemical properties of Ni, successfully making it both active and selective for hydrous hydrazine decomposition.87 The ratio of Ce3+/Ce4+ in the CeO2 of this catalyst was found to be as high as 1.33, indicating that there were a large number of oxygen vacancies in CeO2. These oxygen vacancies perturbed the electronic structure of the nickel atom and caused the nickel atoms nearby to form a special Ni–O–Ce bond, which was a special chemical bond formed by strong-oxide interactions. The existence of electronic exchange between Ni and CeO2 altered the interactions between Ni and N2H4 molecules, which facilitated N–H bond dissociation on Ni, thereby improving H2 generation. In addition, the formed amorphous CeO2 not only stabilized Ni but also provided strong basic sites for promoting hydrogen selectivity (Fig. 13). Studies had shown that the hydrogen selectivity of Ni–0.080CeO2, Ni–0.233CeO2, and Ni–0.500CeO2 could reach 99%. At the same time, the effect of different metal oxides was studied which showed that CeO2 had better hydrogen selectivity than ZrO2, MgO, and La2O3.

Co0.65Pt0.30(CeOx)0.05 complex nanocatalysts were synthesized by a facile co-reduction method using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as the reducing agent at room temperature under an ambient atmosphere.88 It was found that the CeOx played an important role in transforming the crystalline phase of CoPt nanoalloy into the amorphous one. The obtained catalysts showed a high catalytic kinetic performance with 72.1% hydrogen selectivity for decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at 298 K. The initial turnover frequency value reached 194.8 h−1, which greatly encourage the practical application of this catalyst.
Perovskite-type composite oxides have also become one of the promising catalysts for hydrogen generation from the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine. Such materials are often used as anode materials in solid fuel cells. Shao and co-workers synthesized and investigated Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF), SrCoO3−δ (SC), and La0.2Sr0.8CoO3−δ (LSC2) as catalysts for hydrazine decomposition.89,90 It was shown that BSCF could decompose hydrous hydrazine at room temperature, but the main product was NH3. With the increase of the reaction temperature, the hydrogen selectivity was increased. Hydrous hydrazine could be decomposed into hydrogen and nitrogen with 100% selectivity by adding an appropriate amount of KOH at 328 K.
Although complex oxides have been widely used as electrode materials in fuel cells, their disadvantage is the low strength. They are prone to pulverization and peeling off after cycles of operations, which affects their service life. In addition, hydrous hydrazine has a certain degree of reluctivity. Metal cations in complex oxides may be reduced to low valence states during catalytic decomposition of hydrous hydrazine. Therefore, the stability of this catalyst during the reaction needs to be further studied.
2.5 Supported metal catalysts
During catalytic decomposition of hydrous hydrazine, free nanocatalysts may suffer from severe aggregation and agglomeration which significantly reduce the surface area and active sites, and as a result the catalytic performance degrades quickly. Immobilization of the nanocatalysts on the surface of a support/carrier provides an ideal strategy to guarantee the excellent dispersion of the active metal (catalyst) NPs, thus providing the supported nanocatalysts with excellent stability in catalytic performances. In addition, it may also introduce synergistic effects between metal NPs and supporting materials, which may further enhance the catalytic activity and hydrogen selectivity. In some cases, the support can provide a basic chemical milieu to enhance the hydrogen selectivity.

2.5.1 Supported mono-metal catalysts. 
Supported mono-noble-metal catalysts. 
Supported mono-noble-metal catalysts were studied at the early stage; however the catalytic activity is not satisfactory. A series of SiO2 supported group VIII metal catalysts (such as Ru/SiO2 (8.0 wt%), Rh/SiO2 (8.0 wt%), Ir/SiO2 (8.0 wt%), Pd/SiO2 (12.0 wt%), and Pt/SiO2 (12.0 wt%)) for hydrogen generation from decomposition of hydrous hydrazine were studied using a fixed-bed continuous-flow micro-reactor over a wide temperature range.29 All the catalysts could decompose hydrous hydrazine to hydrogen and nitrogen at a temperature higher than 300 °C. Unlike other catalysts, Pd and Pt catalysts showed higher hydrogen selectivity under milder conditions, which is lower than that of Ni/SiO2, Rh/SiO2 (8.0 wt%) and Ir/SiO2 (8.0 wt%). The hydrogen selectivity was low at temperature <300 °C, which indicated that the main reaction was pathway (2). When the reaction temperature was increased to 300 °C or higher, the produced NH3 was further decomposed into hydrogen and nitrogen which indirectly promoted the hydrogen selectivity. As a comparison, the catalytic performance of Rh/SiO2 was better, and the hydrogen selectivity was 100% at 450 °C. In addition, the hydrogen selectivities of Pd/SiO2 (12.0 wt%) and Pt/SiO2 (12.0 wt%) were very high (>90%) at relatively lower reaction temperature (<200 °C), especially at 30–80 °C. The research results indicated that the hydrogen selectivity was highly sensitive to reaction temperature. When the temperature was increased from 80 °C to 200 °C, the hydrogen selectivity of Pd/SiO2 was lowered to only 5%, but then with the further increase of temperature, the hydrogen selectivity increased again. The hydrogen selectivity of Pd/SiO2 was 96.8% at 80 °C, and the hydrogen selectivity of Pt/SiO2 was 97.4% at 50 °C. In another study, Ir was supported on meso-CeO2, which showed a hydrogen selectivity of 34% with the addition of NaOH at 323 K.91
An Al2O3 supported Ir catalyst was prepared using a method involving multiple impregnations.42 The obtained catalyst contained 29–35 wt% of Ir with a size of 2 nm, which were well distributed on the surface of the support. The possible structural model of the catalyst might be Ir4 surrounded by oxygen. Hydrous hydrazine could be decomposed to hydrogen and nitrogen in an oxygen-free environment, with a hydrogen selectivity >91%. At a temperature above 300 °C, hydrogen selectivity could reach 100%. However, this reaction needs to be performed under anaerobic conditions, which is negative to the application.
Later, Cho and co-workers prepared 2 nm sized Ir NPs supported on γ-Al2O3 both with granular and honeycomb structures by repeating the processes of soak-dry, drying, and subsequent reduction.43 It was found that the structure of the obtained catalysts changed from a raft-like to a spherical shape with the increase of the metal content from 5.8% to 16.4%. The hydrous hydrazine decomposition proceeded readily on the honeycomb catalyst containing 2 wt% Ir if the residual water was removed properly at a temperature above 373 K. In addition, a catalytic reaction system for hydrous hydrazine decomposition was designed (Fig. 14). The re-use of the catalysts showed that the activity of Ir/γ-Al2O3 was not significantly reduced. In another study, Ir was immobilized on the pores of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) to form Ir@MIL-101. The obtained catalyst showed good activity for hydrogen generation, but the hydrogen selectivity was low.72

Gaidei et al. utilized the same aluminum carrier to study the catalytic activity of different noble metals. When the metal content was kept at 20%, the order of catalytic activity was Ir > Ru > Rh > Re > Ni > Co > Fe > Mo > Os > Pt > Pd. It should be pointed out that the study only focused on the catalytic activity of the catalyst but not on the hydrogen selectivity.92
Supported mono-noble-metal-free catalysts. 
Although supported noble-metal catalysts exhibit high hydrogen selectivity in the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine, the development of supported free-noble-metal catalysts is highly required for practical applications. Among them, supported Ni- and Fe-based catalysts showed the best performance in hydrous hydrazine decomposition.
The catalytic performances of a series of SiO2 supported metal catalysts were studied using a fixed-bed continuous-flow micro-reactor over a wide temperature range.29 The results showed that all Fe/SiO2 (8.0 wt%), Co/SiO2 (8.0 wt%) and Ni/SiO2 (12.0 wt%) could decompose hydrous hydrazine at a temperature above 573 K. The hydrogen selectivity of the Ni/SiO2 catalyst was higher than 90% at 303 K, which was the best among them. It was found that the hydrogen selectivity was sensitive to the reaction temperature. By increasing the reaction temperature (303–333 K), the hydrogen selectivity increased. However, the hydrogen selectivity of Ni/SiO2 was reduced to less than 5%, with the temperature increasing from 353 K to 573 K, but when the temperature was further increased, hydrogen selectivity increased again. Meanwhile, the synthetic method and the carriers had a significant effect on the catalytic activity and selectivity of the Ni catalyst. Fe/SiO2 showed a low catalytic activity, and the conversion ratio of hydrazine was only 6.4% at 303 K. There was no hydrogen generated over Fe/SiO2 when the temperature was below 573 K, which meant that the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine mainly followed pathway (2). However, the hydrogen selectivity could reach 100% when the temperature was increased to 873 K. Moreover, the hydrogen selectivity over Co/SiO2 (8.0 wt%) was also low at lower temperatures (<573 K), which confirmed that the reaction path was mainly pathway (2) under these experimental conditions.
Al2O3 is another effective supporter for catalysts. Zhang et al. prepared highly dispersed Ni–Al hydrotalcite (Ni–Al2O3-HT) catalysts for hydrogen generation from hydrous hydrazine decomposition.93 The average size of Ni was ∼4 nm and the catalyst had a very high Ni loading of ∼78 wt%. The resultant Ni–Al2O3-HT catalyst exhibited 100% conversion and 93% hydrogen selectivity at 303 K. The excellent hydrogen selectivity was due to the combined effects of the small Ni NPs and strong basic sites located nearby.38–40,93,94 However, when the reaction temperature was increased from 323 K to 353 K, the reaction was completed within 5 min but the selectivity was reduced to 82%, which indicated that a higher temperature was unfavorable for pathway (1) but the reaction took place faster than that at a lower temperature. In contrast, the 78 wt% Ni/Al2O3-IMP catalyst exhibited a much lower activity, with a total reaction time of 440 min, and the hydrogen selectivity was only 66%. This result was consistent with the poor dispersion of Ni.
A series of Ni/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by solution combustion synthesis (SCS) and the catalytic performances in decomposition of hydrous hydrazine were investigated.95 The parameters, such as the ratio of precursor oxidizers (nickel nitrate and ammonium cerium nitrate), fuel-to-oxidizer ratio (0.5–3) and fuel type (hydrous hydrazine and glycine), affected the combustion behavior and the physicochemical properties of the catalysts such as crystallinity, Ni particle size, surface area, pore size etc. Among the obtained catalysts, the tailored 6 wt% Ni/CeO2 one with a fuel-to-oxidizer ratio of 2 and hydrazine fuel (denoted as 6 wt% Ni/CeO2-HH-2) showed 100% hydrogen selective and an excellent TOF of 34.0 h−1 at 323 K. The 3 wt% Ni/CeO2-HH-2 one also had a hydrogen selectivity of 100%, but a relatively low TOF of 20.9 h−1.
It was reported that RANEY® Ni was active and has a hydrogen selectivity >99% during hydrous hydrazine decomposition in the presence of NaOH at 303 K, which was probably caused by a relatively low content of remaining aluminum.51 The separation of the catalysts from the reaction solution was simply realized by using a magnet, as RANEY® Ni had excellent magnetic properties. This convenient route provided great potential for industrial applications.
Very recently, Wang and co-workers successfully encapsulated Ni NPs in the channel of titanate nanotubes (TNTs) by capillary force under ultrasonic treatment (Fig. 15).96 The confinement effect of TNTs led to a smaller mean size of the encapsulated Ni NPs (2.4 nm). The resultant Ni@TNTs exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity and an average TOF of 96.0 h−1 for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine. The stability of the catalysts was excellent, and no decrease in performance was observed after 6 cycles of catalytic reactions. The excellent performance of the catalysts was due to the small NP size and high dispersion of Ni NPs after encapsulation in the channel of TNTs.

2.5.2 Supported bimetal catalysts. 
Supported Ni–Ir catalysts. 
Wang and co-workers synthesized various Ir-modified Ni/meso-CeO2 catalysts using a combination of solution combustion synthesis (SCS) and galvanic replacement methods.91 The obtained Ni@Ir/meso-CeO2 had a highly porous structure with a pore size of 20–22 nm (Fig. 16a). The HRTEM image (Fig. 16b) depicted that the catalyst consisted of crystalline CeO2 and Ni–Ir alloys (3.5 nm) and some amorphous phases. The Ni@Ir/meso-CeO2 catalyst showed performances that depended on the Ir content. When the molar ratio of Ir/Ni was 1/6.53 (Ni87Ir13/meso-CeO2), the catalyst exhibited an optimal catalytic performance with a hydrogen selectivity of 100% at 323 K in the presence of NaOH. A further increase of the molar ratio of Ir/Ni to 1/3.83 resulted in a slightly increased activity, but the hydrogen selectivity was reduced from 100% to 91%. Experimental studies confirmed that the Ni–Ir alloying is the key that dominated the catalytic properties of the Ni@Ir/meso-CeO2. The DFT calculations strongly suggested that the Ni–Ir alloying was thermodynamically favorable. When the Ir concentration was low, the Ir atoms preferred to stay in the surface layer of Ni in the form of monomers.

Al2O3 supported Ni–Ir nanocatalysts were firstly studied for gas hydrazine decomposition by Wise and co-workers in 1979.102 Later, Ir modified Ni/Al2O3 catalysts were also prepared by using Ni–Al hydrotalcite as a precursor.98 The NiIrx/Al2O3 catalysts showed a high hydrogen selectivity for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at 303 K without the addition of alkaline. Compared to Ni/Al2O3, the reaction rate of NiIr0.059/Al2O3 was increased by 6 times, and the hydrogen selectivity increased from 93% to >99%. The catalyst prepared by this method was better than Ni/meso-CeO2 mentioned before,91 regardless of the Ir content and the reaction conditions.
MOFs are also used to support Ni–Ir nanocatalysts. Highly dispersed ultrafine Ni–Ir NPs with different compositions were successfully encapsulated into the cavities of MIL-101 by a simple liquid impregnation method.72 The catalytic activities depended on the composition of metals, support materials, alkaline, and reaction temperature. The unique porous structure of MIL-101 and the synergetic effect remarkably promoted the catalytic activity of Ni–Ir. Among all the catalysts prepared, Ni85Ir15@MIL-101 exhibited the highest catalytic performance in the presence of NaOH at 323 K. Even at 298 K, the hydrogen selectivity of Ni85Ir15@MIL-101 reached 100%. The stability of the catalyst was good due to the immobilization of Ni–Ir into the pores of MIL-101. Later, a series of bimetallic materials such as Ni–Pt and Ni–Ir NPs were immobilized in MOFs containing various functional groups and the catalytic performances were studied.103 It was found that the surface functional group of MOFs remarkably affected the catalytic activity of the loaded catalysts. The electron-donating group positivity contributed to the activity of the catalysts. The hydrogen selectivities of Ni0.8Ir0.2/MIL-101-NH2 and Ni0.8Ir0.2/MIL-101 were 100% in the presence of NaOH at 298 K.
Supported Ni–Rh catalysts. 
Hollow spheres can be applied as a support for Ni–Rh nanocatalysts. By using SiO2 microspheres as a template and urea solution as a weak alkalinity medium (at high temperature) to facilitate the uniform deposition of metal precursors and gradual dissolution of the SiO2 core, hollow Ni–Rh coated silica microspheres (Ni–Rh@SiO2) were successfully synthesized.104 The obtained bimetallic Ni–Rh@SiO2 catalyst with a low Rh content (<6.35%) exhibited a high hydrogen selectivity of 99.4% at 298 K and a high turnover of 66. The used Ni–Rh@SiO2 catalysts could be easily recovered by using a magnet and reused with identical activity, which is promising for practical applications.
Lu and co-workers successfully immobilized Ni–Rh NPs on the surface of Ce(OH)CO3 nanorods by a facile co-reduction method.105 The obtained Ni–Rh/Ce(OH)CO3 nanocomposites with various metal ratios were utilized as catalysts for hydrazine decomposition. Among them, the Ni45Rh55/Ce(OH)CO3 nanocatalysts exhibited a hydrogen selectivity of 100% for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine and a TOF of 150 h−1 at 303 K. The excellent catalytic performance could be attributed not only to the strain and ligand effects between Ni and Rh, but also to the strong interaction between Ni–Rh NPs and the Ce(OH)CO3 support.
There are a number of studies on the use of MOFs such as ZIF and MIL to support Ni–Rh nanocatalysts. The corresponding Ni66Rh34@ZIF-8,106,107 Ni42Rh58@MIL-101,108 Ni0.2Rh0.8/MIL-101 (ref. 109) and Ni3Rh7/NPC-900 (ref. 110) exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity in the presence of NaOH at 323 K. The proposed reasons for the promoted catalytic performance were as follows: (1) the synergistic molecular-scale alloying effect of the bimetallic Ni–Rh NPs on MOFs and the promotion effect of MOFs; (2) most of the Ni–Rh NPs were immobilized on the surface of ZIF-8 and MIL-101 which had a large surface area, high thermal stability in water, which benefited the activity, durability and stability of the Ni–Rh catalysts in decomposition of hydrous hydrazine.
Graphene was also applied as a carrier for Ni–Rh catalysts (Fig. 17).49 The resultant catalyst exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity with the addition of NaOH at room temperature. The excellent catalytic performance was due to the small size of Ni–Rh NPs (5 nm) and their excellent dispersion on the graphene surfaces (Fig. 17a). In contrast, for the Ni–Rh catalysts synthesized without GO, the Ni–Rh particles were heavily aggregated to form larger particles with an average size of ∼26 nm (Fig. 17b). Correspondingly, the hydrogen selectivity was only 40%. CeOx-modified Ni–Rh NPs with a size of ∼3.5 nm grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) (Ni–Rh@CeOx/rGO) were also prepared and investigated.111 The obtained Ni0.2Rh0.8CeOx/rGO exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity for hydrogen generation from the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at 323 K. The total TOF of Ni0.2Rh0.8CeOx/rGO for hydrogen generation was 666.7 h−1, much higher than that of the benchmark catalyst Ni0.2Rh0.8 and Ni0.2Rh0.8CeOx without rGO supports. The synergistic structure and electronic effects of the NiRh NPs, CeOx and RGO support, as well as the high dispersion of the NiRh NPs provided excellent catalytic performance. Moreover, this general method can be easily extended to synthesize other metal/rGO catalysts with the doping of rare-earth oxides for more applications.

MXenes are a class of two-dimensional inorganic compounds consisting of a few atoms thick layers of transition metal carbides, nitrides or carbonitrides.112–115 Recently, Gao and co-workers successfully anchored bimetallic Ni–Rh on titanium carbides (MXene) and studied the catalytic performance of the obtained NiRh/MXene in hydrous hydrazine decomposition.116 The TEM and HRTEM images (Fig. 18) of NiRh/MXene confirmed that the NiRh NPs were homogeneously dispersed on the surface of the MXene. The average size of the NiRh particles is about 2.8 nm. Due to the small particles size and synergistic effect, Ni0.2Rh0.8/MXene demonstrated 100% hydrogen selectivity, excellent durability and high reaction kinetics at 323 K in the presence of NaOH.

Supported Ni–Pt catalysts. 
Al2O3 supported NiPtx can be synthesized by using Ni–Al hydrotalcite as the starting material.99 It was found that a Ni–Pt alloy was formed on the surface of the catalyst which affected the nature of the chemisorption bond between adspecies (i.e. H2 and NHx) and the Ni surface atoms. This effect weakened the bonding between H2, NHx and Ni, and thus led to a high reaction rate and promoted hydrogen selectivity. The obtained NiPt0.057/Al2O3 exhibited a hydrogen selectivity of 98% and a much higher TOF compared to Ni/Al2O3.99 In another study, Ni–Pt catalysts were successfully loaded on mesoporous alumina (MA) by a simple one-pot evaporation-induced self-assembly method.77 The synthesized Ni–Pt/MA catalysts exhibited an excellent activity, 100% hydrogen selectivity and a satisfactory stability for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine under mild conditions.
When Ni–Pt bimetallic NPs were loaded on mesoporous ceria, excellent catalysts for hydrous hydrazine decomposition were obtained.100 The combined effects of the Pt-induced electronic and geometric modification of the catalyst surface and the enrichment of strong basic sites, as well as the high surface area and resistance to alkaline solution originated from CeO2 gave rise to the excellent catalytic performance of the obtained catalysts. As an example, the Ni60Pt40/CeO2 catalyst was able to completely decompose hydrous hydrazine to generate hydrogen at 303 K in the presence of 2 M NaOH. In another study, amorphous Ni0.9Pt0.1/Ce2O3 NPs were synthesized by a co-reduction route at room temperature under an ambient atmosphere.117 The resultant Ni0.9Pt0.1/Ce2O3 catalyst achieved 100% hydrogen selectivity at 298 K with a TOF of 28.1 h−1. Importantly, the amorphous Ni0.9Pt0.1/Ce2O3 catalyst demonstrated a much higher activity and a much lower activation energy than crystalline Ni0.9Pt0.1 which would benefit the applications of these catalysts at relatively low temperatures.
Supported Ni–Pt nanocatalysts on La2O3 were also investigated by Wang and co-workers.118 The Ni60Pt40/La2O3 catalyst prepared by a one-pot co-precipitation method showed an exceptionally high activity and 100% selectivity towards hydrogen generation from hydrous hydrazine at 303 K. It was proposed that the excellent catalytic performance was mainly because Pt regulated the electronic structure and geometry of Ni. A hydrogen generation system was built using high-concentration hydrous hydrazine as a raw material with this catalyst. The hydrogen storage density of this system could reach 6 wt%, which was the highest attainable value for the current hydrous hydrazine generation system. The same group reported a supported core–shell structured Ni@Ni–Pt/La2O3 catalyst synthesized by a combination of co-precipitation and galvanic replacement methods.119 The obtained catalysts exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine, which was correlated with the Pt-induced electronic and geometric modifications on the catalyst surface. A low noble metal loading Ni0.90Pt0.05Rh0.05/La2O3 catalyst was synthesized through a surfactant-aided co-reduction method in CTAC under an ambient atmosphere at 298 K, and the resultant catalyst showed 100% hydrogen selectivity for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at room temperature.120
A MOF is a kind of effective carrier for Ni–Pt nanocatalysts.107,121 NiPt NPs can be well immobilized and distributed on the MOF (e.g. ZIF-8) surface.121 The average diameter of the loaded Ni–Pt NPs was 2.2 ± 0.3 nm. ZIF-8 was chosen because it held a 3-dimensional structural feature, large surface area (BET, ∼1400 m2 g−1), and high thermal and chemical stability in alkaline solution. The resultant Ni80Pt20@ZIF-8 catalyst exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity in the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at 323 K in the presence of NaOH. Later, the same research group immobilized Ni–Pt NPs on water soluble carbon nanodots (CNDs) derived from ZIF-8 by a simple reduction of metal precursors in the presence of CNDs (Fig. 19).122 The Ni–Pt NPs were highly dispersed on the surface of the hydrophilic CNDs, which effectively prevented the aggregation of particles in solution, thus leading to excellent catalytic activity and stability. The resultant Ni40Pt60/ZIF-8 CNDs exerted 100% hydrogen selectivity and a high activity for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at 303 K. The synergistic effect of the CND support and the Ni–Pt NPs also contributed to the excellent catalytic performance. Other MOF loaded NiPt NPs, such as Ni88Pt12@MIL-101123,124 and Ni0.9Pt0.1/MIL-101_A,125 also exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity at 323 K in the presence of NaOH. A series of Ni–Pt alloy NPs immobilized on MOFs containing various functional groups were investigated.103 It was found that the NiPt NPs immobilized by MIL-101 functionalized with the electron-donating group –NH2 possessed higher activity than that immobilized with bare MIL-101 and MIL-101 with electron-accepting functional groups. The different activities might be caused by the different interaction strengths between hydrazine molecules and the functional groups on the surface of the MOF supports. There are some studies about other MOF or MOF derived carbon supported NiPt NPs such as Ni64Pt36/MIL-96 and (Ni3Pt7)0.5–(MnOx)0.5/NPC-900.126,127 The Ni64Pt36/MIL-96 catalyst showed 100% hydrogen selectivity at 298 K,127 and the (Ni3Pt7)0.5–(MnOx)0.5/NPC-900 catalyst also showed a high activity with a TOF of 706 h−1 at 323 K.126

Peng and co-workers synthesized and compared carbon supported octahedral and spherical Ni–Pt NPs (Pt–Ni/C) for hydrous hydrazine decomposition.128 It is well known that different shaped crystalline particles expose different crystal facets, leading to different properties and activities.129–131 A Ni–Pt octahedral particle had 8 (111) surfaces (Fig. 20a).128 It was found that the Ni–Pt (111) surface could promote the N–H scission and suppress the N–N scission during hydrazine decomposition, thus leading to superior H2 selectivity (Fig. 20b). The model octahedral Ni–Pt/C nanocatalyst exhibited a TOF value of 210 h−1, 100% hydrogen selectivity and excellent durability and stability at 323 K. In comparison, the hydrogen selectivity of the spherical NiPt/C and NiPt3/C was limited to only ∼72% and 75% respectively.128 Very recently, in consideration of reusability of catalysts, controllability of the decomposition reaction and the simple design of hydrogen generator, Wang and co-workers developed a monolithic Ni–Pt/CeO2/granular activated carbon catalyst.132 The catalyst was able to completely decompose hydrous hydrogen in the presence of 1 M NaOH at 323 K. The hydrogen generation system has a material-based hydrogen capacity of 6.54%, which is promising for practical application.

Boron and nitrogen co-doped graphene (BNG) was developed by Luo and co-workers to support NiPt NPs for hydrogen production from decomposition of hydrous hydrazine.133 It was found that the synergistic effect of the separate B and N doping, high boron and pyridinic N contents and the good dispersion of the NiPt NPs led to the excellent catalytic performance of the BNG supported NiPt NPs (NiPt/BNG-1000, the number 1000 indicates that the catalyst was annealed at 1000 °C). The obtained nanocatalyst Ni3Pt7/BNG-1000 exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity and a TOF of 199.4 h−1 at room temperature in the presence of NaOH.
There are many other supported Ni–Pt nanocatalysts which can completely decompose hydrous hydrazine into hydrogen and nitrogen. For example, G4-OH(Ni48Pt12) with NaOH at 343 K,134 Ni37Pt63/g-C3N4 with NaOH at 323 K,135 Ni0.4Pt0.6/PDA-rGO at 303 K,136 Ni84Pt16/graphene with NaOH at 298 K,75 Ni0.58Pt0.42/graphene with NaOH at 303 and 323 K,137 and so on.


2.5.3 Other supported bimetal and trimetal catalysts. 
Except the supported Ni-noble metal bimetal nanocatalysts, supported Co-, Cu-, Fe- and NiFe-noble metal nanocatalysts were also intensively investigated (Table 5).75,98,101,138 For example, CoIr0.081/γ-Al2O3 synthesized by a wet impregnation method followed by air calcination and hydrogen reduction exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at 298 K.101 Trimetallic Ni–Fe–Pd NPs anchored on MIL-101 showed 100% hydrogen selectivity for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at 323 K.138

Supported multi-noble-metal-free catalysts. 
Ni–Fe bimetallic catalysts exhibited high hydrogen selectivity for hydrogen generation from the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine among various supported multi-noble-metal-free catalysts. Wu and co-workers synthesized monodisperse Ni3Fe single-crystalline nanospheres with a size of 8.1 nm and a specific surface area of 182.3 m2 g−1, and immobilized the Ni3Fe on carbon particles.139 The obtained Ni3Fe/C catalysts showed 100% hydrogen selectivity and a total turnover of 15480 in 30 h at room temperature, which is promising for practical applications.
MgO was selected as a support for Ni–Fe bimetallic nanocatalysts because it can play roles of both a matrix and a solid alkali, which is an important factor for the enhancement of hydrogen selectivity.140 The basicity of Ni1.5Fe1.0/(MgO)x can be easily tuned by varying the amount of the Mg precursor. As a result, an optimized bifunctional Ni1.5Fe1.0/(MgO)2.5 catalyst containing both an active center and a solid base center was realized. Ni1.5Fe1.0/(MgO)2.5 achieved a high catalytic performance with 99% hydrogen selectivity at room temperature, which was much higher than that of Ni1.5Fe1.0 without the MgO support. It was noticed that there was no obvious correlation between the catalytic performance and surface area, further confirming that the basicity of the MgO support has a more significant effect on the catalytic performance.
CeOx-modified Ni–Fe catalysts with branched nano-dendritic architectures were anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through a simple co-reduction method.141 The synergistic electronic effect between Ni, Fe and Ce, as well as the dendritic morphology with a large number of active sites gave rise to a high catalytic performance. The resultant Ni3Fe–(CeOx)0.15/rGO exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity at 343 K in the presence of NaOH. Zhang and co-workers successfully loaded Co0.85Se nanosheets onto the surface of 2D graphene.142 The thickness of the 2D catalyst is only 3 nm. The obtained Co0.85Se/graphene could decompose hydrous hydrazine with 97% hydrogen selectivity and the catalytic performance remained constant after 10 cycles of reaction. Wen and co-workers studied hydrous hydrazine decomposition over a multi-component NiCo/NiO–CeOx ultrathin layered catalyst fabricated by a dynamics controlling coprecipitation–reduction (DCCR) process followed by calcination.143 In this multi-component catalyst, the Ni–Co electronic interactions and the strong basic sites on the surface of the NiO–CoOx support remarkably enhanced the catalytic activity. A hydrogen selectivity of 99% was achieved for hydrazine decomposition at room temperature.
The addition of non-metallic elements sometimes brings about better results. A series of Ni-based catalysts such as NiMoB–La(OH)3 (Ni64.1Mo11.5B24.4–La(OH)3 55 wt% La(OH)3) could completely decompose hydrous hydrazine with 100% hydrogen selectivity in an alkaline solution at 323 K.86 For Fe-based catalysts, the single Fe catalyst was not active in the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at room temperature, but showed better catalytic performances after introduction of B. Multiwalled carbon nanotube supported Fe–B catalysts (Fe–B/MWCNTs) were synthesized and applied for catalytic decomposition of hydrous hydrazine.97 9.86 wt% Fe–B/MWCNTs achieved an excellent catalytic performance with 97.0% hydrogen selectivity at room temperature. N- and H-incorporated Co–B amorphous nanowires were also prepared and investigated.144 The incorporation of N and H into the Co–B nanowires not only introduced basic sites, but also weakened the interactions between adspecies produced (including H2 and NHx) and surface Co atoms. Together with their unique one-dimensional nanostructure and N and H incorporation, the resultant Co–B–N–H nanowires exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at 293 K.
Molybdenum carbide (MoC and Mo2C) is a promising catalyst for hydrazine decomposition. Generally, Mo2C is loaded on the surfaces of carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes, activated carbon (AC), and ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC).145–148 Mo2C NPs can be well dispersed on the carbon surface, leading to good catalytic activity and stability. For example, Mo2C (3–5 mm) embedded in OMC (MoC–OMC) was synthesized by one-pot direct carbonization of a self-assembled composite that was made from F127 (EO106PO70EO106), resorcinol-formaldehyde and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O or (NH4)2WO4 in an acidic medium of aqueous ethanol solution.148 The resultant MoC–OMC catalyst exhibited 100% hydrogen selectivity for the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine at 303 K, which was much better than that of Mo2C/OMC, Mo2C/AC and pure Mo2C. The highly dispersed MoC on the carbon surface and the formation of the MoC phase led to the enhanced catalytic activity.

3. Conclusions and future prospects
To facilitate practical hydrogen production from hydrous hydrazine decomposition, developing catalysts which can selectively decompose hydrazine into only H2 and N2 is highly required. In the past two decades, many catalysts including noble metal, bimetal, metal oxide, metal–metal oxide complex and supported nanocatalysts have been explored and intensively investigated. Many of the nanocatalysts have shown a hydrogen selectivity of 100% or close to 100%. Based on the above reviewed research studies, the methods to improve the hydrogen selectivity mainly include: (1) forming metallic alloys. Generally alloy metal catalysts offer better catalytic activity and selectivity compared with the corresponding single component counterparts. The strong metal–metal interactions in the alloy may tune the surface structure and properties of the catalysts and the interactions between the catalyst surface and reactant molecules as well as stabilize the preferred reaction intermediates, thus leading to higher catalytic activity and hydrogen selectivity. (2) Introducing strong metal–support interaction effects. The catalyst support (metal oxides in general) not only improves the dispersion of the active NPs but also promotes the catalytic performance via the SMSI effect. The interaction between the support and loaded metal catalysts may alter the chemical properties of the loaded metals and the interaction between the metals and N2H4 molecule and reaction intermediates, facilitating the dissociation of the N–H bond rather than the N–N bond. Therefore the metallic nanocatalysts become both active and selective for complete hydrous hydrazine decomposition. (3) Creating a basic chemical milieu for the nanocatalysts. The presence of a strong basic chemical environment could inhibit the generation of the basic product of NH3 which push hydrazine decomposition to follow the complete decomposition pathway, resulting in improved hydrogen selectivity. The basic chemical milieu can be realized by directly adding an alkali such as NaOH and KOH, or by introducing a catalyst support/carrier whose surface has a large number of strong basic sites. (4) Increasing the surface area and active sites through an optimized synthetic method. For example, previously Ni was found to have a very low activity for hydrous hydrazine decomposition. However, very recently, Ni nanofibers synthesized via electrospinning and vacuum thermal reduction methods showed a near 100% hydrogen selectivity and a TOF of 6.9 h−1 at 333 K.149 The Ni nanofibers were composed of small Ni NPs (11 nm in diameter) with a large surface area of 132 m2 g−1. Through an optimized synthetic process, metal nanocrystals with specific exposed crystal facets and defects can be designed and synthesized. For instance, Xia et al. recently successfully prepared Ru icosahedral nanocages with exposed (111) facets and twin boundaries.150 The icosahedral nanocages showed higher hydrogen selectivity than the cubic and octahedral counterparts, proving the importance of exposure of active crystal facets and twin defects. Synthesis of high quality metallic nanocrystals with designed exposed crystal facets also provides an important way to systematically study the activity and selectivity of specific crystal facets, which in turn will benefit the design of high performance nanocatalysts for hydrazine decomposition. It was reported that the configuration of alloy nanocatalysts such as the core–shell structure in which the core material is able to provide electrons to the catalyst shell is also important to the selectivity and catalytic activity. This can be designed and tailored by meticulous synthesis.
Inspirations from other catalysis systems may open new avenues for the catalytic decomposition of hydrous hydrazine. For example, very recently, Zhang and co-workers reported Ni3FeN nanocatalysts for the dehydrogenation of NH3BH3.151 Different from the conventional loading of nanocatalysts on a support to avoid aggregation in hydrous hydrazine decomposition research, they coated a mesoporous silica layer on the surface of Ni3FeN nanocatalysts (Ni3FeN@SiO2) (Fig. 21). This new design not only prevented the aggregation of the catalysts during the catalytic reaction, but also enhanced the hydrophilicity of the catalyst surface, thus promoting the transportation of reactants to the catalyst surfaces. The Ni3FeN@SiO2 nanocatalysts showed a TOF 28.34 times higher than that of bare Ni3FeN. In addition, it was found that the metal multi-vacancies in the catalysts significantly contributed to the adsorption of the reactant on the catalyst surface, thus enhancing the catalytic activity. This kind of effect was rarely investigated in the catalytic decomposition of hydrous hydrazine. Some attempts to use light energy to drive the catalytic decomposition of hydrazine were reported recently. For example, Szunerits and co-workers introduced a Rh–TiO2 photocatalyst and realized the decomposition of hydrous hydrazine under visible light irradiation.152 Tong and co-workers investigated hydrazine decomposition over indium nanocubes under light irradiation. It was found that the hot electron induced by the localized surface plasmon resonance effect of indium nanocubes under light irradiation mediated the catalytic activity toward the hydrous hydrazine decomposition.153

Overall, after two decades of research, hydrous hydrazine has shown its great potential as a liquid phase hydrogen storage material. Hydrazine has its unique advantages as a liquid fuel including easy refueling, only environmentally friendly emission of N2 if it is completely decomposed, and no solid residue formation. However, to push forward its real-world application, many factors still need to be considered and addressed. From the standpoint of catalysts, developing low-cost, noble-metal-free, or low noble content nanocatalysts to reach 100% hydrogen selectivity is highly required. The Ni–Fe based catalyst is one of the ideal candidates. The improvement of the stability and durability of the catalysts is also needed to meet the requirement for industry application. In view of engineering and technology, the reaction system/device should be deliberately designed, while the corresponding leakage monitoring and emergency treatment, and the treatment of residual hydrous hydrazine need to be carried out by systematic research.
In addition, although great efforts have been devoted to searching and investigating various nanocatalysts for selective decomposition of hydrous hydrogen, theoretical study of the hydrazine decomposition mechanism is not enough. Experimental data together with theoretical calculation such as DFT78,94,154–156 could be helpful to clarify and understand reaction details, thus providing a powerful pathway to guide the design of catalyst surfaces on a molecular scale. Such studies will underpin the foundation for the development of reliable catalysts for the practical application of hydrous hydrazine as a liquid fuel in the future.
