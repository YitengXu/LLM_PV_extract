Introduction
The catalytic conversion of the extremely stable CO2 molecule to usable fuels or chemical products is a critical goal that would positively impact the global environment, hopefully helping in overcoming some of the problems of energy crisis.1–6 Valuable products, such as carbon monoxide, formic acid and high-molecular-weight polymers, obtained from the electrochemical conversion of CO2, have been indicated as chemicals that can store intermittent energy sources, thus balancing power supply, energy demand and environmental concerns of greenhouse gas emissions. A possible approach to reduce the large overpotentials required for this multi-electron process is the use of organometal molecular compounds, able to catalyze CO2 reduction through proton-assisted processes.4,7 Most electrocatalytic studies in this field focus primarily on the catalyst/substrate interaction in homogeneous solution. Relatively few studies were focused on the heterogeneous electrochemical catalysis despite the large number of potential advantages such as easier recovery of products and catalysts, small amounts of catalyst necessary for efficient electrolysis, deactivation pathways often hindered or suppressed and elimination of solubility problems. Furthermore, in a heterogeneous system the electron transfer will be more efficient to the attached or bonded catalyst compared with that in solution, lowering the limitation of the electron transfer in the catalytic cycle. Transition metal complexes immobilized on electrode surfaces can represent promising catalysts to be utilized in a large-scale process for CO2 reduction, particularly if non-precious metals like cobalt, iron, nickel, copper, and zinc are involved. Although interest in this area began several decades ago, it has drawn substantial attention only in recent years, due to the development of photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells dedicated to CO2 reduction, currently one of the most popular topics.6 PEC cell design is a complex matter and involves simultaneous managing of a multitude of processes related to solar excitation, charge separation, electrical conduction, molecular transport, catalytic chemistry, and reaction product recovery. Progress in this field has been made, especially for H2O reduction,8,9 but PECs for CO2 reduction are still in their infancy. An interesting review on modified electrodes by anchoring transition metal complexes as catalysts for CO2 reduction has been published some years ago by Vos and coworkers.10 Nevertheless the field is so rapidly growing both in interest and importance that a critical overview of the recent results is desirable. In this focus we present a brief overview of the most important recent results of such modified electrodes as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction by different methods of anchoring transition metal complexes on the electrodes.
Electrode functionalization by adsorption
Among the different techniques for immobilizing the catalysts onto the electrode surface, chemisorption certainly represents one of the most convenient methods.11–13 Catalyst molecules bearing special moieties such as aromatic groups or double bonds, etc. show chemical affinity to form spontaneously non-covalent modification of electrode surfaces stable enough for long periods in solvents where they are insoluble. Meshitsuka and coworkers14 in 1974 published the first attempt to perform heterogeneous CO2 electrocatalysis by phthalocyanine (Pc) metal (Mn, Pd, Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni) complexes (MPc) adsorbed on the graphite electrode surface; Co(Pc) is proved to be one of the most reactive catalysts for CO2 electroreduction. After the seminal work of Lehn and coworkers15 who introduced the bipyridyl Re complex into CO2 electrocatalysis, many efforts have been made on these complexes due to their higher selectivity compared with other catalysts. However the first paper of non-covalent surface attachment of a bipyridyl Re molecular complex for catalytic CO2 reduction appeared only in 2013.16 A graphite electrode was modified with a Re complex containing pyrene groups that sticks on the graphite electrode through a π–π stacking interaction. At a rather negative applied potential, −1.67 V vs. NHE (normal hydrogen electrode), in acetonitrile, the modified electrode shows CO faradaic efficiency (ηco, defined as the moles of electrons consumed to get the desired reaction product divided by the total moles of electrons transferred from the anode to the cathode6) = 70% and TONCO = 58 with no H2 formation (TON = turn over number, defined as the moles of intended reaction product formed divided by the moles of catalytic sites). The functionalized surface lost its activity after 1 h due to the reduction of the pyrenyl moieties at the very negative potentials, probably due to electrostatic repulsion with the surface and consequent loss of planarity and surface binding.
Compared to CO2 reduction by the one-electron process, proton coupled multi-electron reduction requires less overpotential.10,17 An ITO/multilayer electrode18 was modified by the layer-by-layer method (LBL) with the corresponding multimetallic complex, Mn(III)/Ni(II)/Zn(II) μ-(meso-5,10,15,20-tetra(pyridyl)porphyrin) tetrakis [bis(bipyridine) chloride ruthenium(II)] ([MTRP]n+ (Fig. 1; M = Mn(III), Ni(II) and Zn(II), n = 5, 4, 4 respectively), and polyoxotungstate ([SiW12O40]4−). By performing electrolysis at −0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 6 h in aqueous solution, CO was the only product on the [ZnTRP]n+/[SiW12O40]4− multilayer electrode with TONCO = 3850, while the analogues [NiTRP]4+/[SiW12O40]4− and [MnTRP]5+/[SiW12O40]4− produced methanol (TONMeOH = 1.76 × 105) and formic acid (TONHCOOH = 1.06 × 106), respectively. It is worth noting in the energy transfer of the TRP that extra irradiation altered the catalysis pathway and lowered the potential, enhancing the catalytic efficiency. At −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl under irradiation, [MnTRP]5+/[SiW12O40]4− produced formaldehyde only with TONHCHO = 1.8 × 105.

With the help of polyethyleneimine and high surface area multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), Zhao and coworkers19 were able to produce cobalt tetra-amino-phthalocyanine (CoTAPc) modified electrodes with multilayers by using the LBL self-assembly technique. The new electrodes significantly decreased the overpotential of the CO2 reduction, and the cathode successfully reduced CO2 to formic acid. The MWCNT/CoTAPc modified electrode produced double the number of moles of formic acid compared to the electrode without MWCNTs. Later, they reported a glassy carbon (GC) or carbon felt electrode functionalized with MWCNT/FeTAPc, showing catalysis at less negative potential and a higher reaction rate than the electrode with only MWCNTs or FeTAPc.20
Electrode functionalization by the membrane
Polymeric matrices which could confine the catalyst in a membrane attached onto the electrode surface provide another convenient way for electrode modification. The electrochemical reaction takes place in the membrane-electrode-catalyst layers and requires high proton and electron conductivity, and effective access of reactants to the catalyst. Preliminary investigation in this field has been reported by Yoshida and coworkers21 who studied the catalytic activity towards CO2 reduction in aqueous solution of [Co(tpy)2]2+ (tpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) on Nafion coated carbon electrodes. Re(bpy)(CO)3Br and Re(tpy)(CO)3Br (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, tpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine) coated on Nafion membranes in aqueous solution showed higher selectivity,22 but are strongly dependent on the applied potentials. In particular the Re(tpy)(CO)3Br complex produces mainly formic acid and requires larger overpotential than the bpy analogue.
As a substitute of Re, bipyridyl Mn complexes show excellent selectivity in CO2 with23 and without24 added Brønsted acid. In 2014 Cowan's group25 embedded [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br] in a Nafion membrane as an active heterogeneous electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction in a neutral aqueous electrolyte at less negative potential compared with the homogeneous solution. Although the number of active catalytic molecules was rather limited in the membrane, the TON reached 471 (∼36 fold higher than the homogeneous counterpart23), ηCO = 51% and ηH2 = 24% after 4 hours at −1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br]/MWCNT/Nafion electrode leads to a 10 fold current enhancement, but with a lower TON value (101) and lower selectivity (ηCO = 22%, ηH2 = 47%). Very recently, they immobilized [Mn(bpy(tBu)2CO)3Br]26 (bpy(tBu)2 = 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine) on GC using Nafion/MWCNTs. This film improved the selectivity towards CO2 at −1.4 V vs. SCE (ηCO = 44%, ηH2 = 46%), exceeding that of the previously reported [Mn(bpy)(CO)3Br]/MWCNT/Nafion electrode. The catalysts obtained by replacing bpy with 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid bpy or with 4,4′-diol bpy were found to be active towards CO2 in acetonitrile solutions, but not in Nafion membranes. Aoi and coworkers27 studied the CO2 reduction with a GC electrode modified by a CoCl2 complex, CoII(Ch), adsorbed on MWCNTs confined in Nafion (Fig. 2). At −1.1 V vs. NHE in aqueous solution in pH 4.6 buffer, the system yielded CO and H2 as major products with TON = 1100 (with a turn over frequency, TOF, defined as the TON divided by the reaction time, equal to 140 h−1) ηCO = 89%, ηH2 = 11%.

The gas diffusion electrode (GDE) promotes catalytic CO2 reduction in solution at the gas–liquid interface.29 Meyer's group28 reported a GDE/MWCNT/Ir/PEG system (Ir = iridium catalyst, see Fig. 3, PEG = polyethylene glycol) for CO2 reduction, where the catalyst was non-covalently adsorbed on the MWCNT, and covered by PEG on the top of the surface. Also, the GC and the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes were investigated for comparison. The GDE system showed a little better TON than others, while the GC system exhibited ηHCOO− = 93%, TON = 5300 in 2 h at −1.4 V vs. NHE in aqueous solution with ηH2 = 7%, and TON = 203000 in 8 h, which is about four orders of magnitude higher than homogeneous solution.30

By using a membrane, anchoring the catalyst becomes easier, and the catalysis can be directly tested. Singh and coworkers31 tested the CO2 reduction catalytic activity of Ni and Cu salen ligand complexes directly applied with Nafion coated on the GDE. These salen ligand complexes showed long stability and produced more quantity of hydrocarbons and CO at a 10–25% less overpotential than their respective metals, with a total η value of 74% for the Ni complex and 25% for Cu the complex at −1.5 V and −1.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. The catalyst (N,N-bis(salicylidene)-ethylenediamine-Co) was dispersed in carbon black,32 and the mixture was covered with Nafion over the GDE. The electrode with 60 wt% exhibited the best activity for CO2 reduction in aqueous solution, due to the right balance of porosity and conductivity of the carbon black mixture.
Electrode modification by covalent organic frameworks (COFs)
Without the membrane support, the catalyst can also be physically compacted on the rough electrode surface. Very recently Yaghi and corworkers33,34 reported cobalt porphyrin catalysts on COFs, bridged by organic struts via functional groups. The microcrystalline COF formed automatically on alumina coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)34 or the powders was directly deposited on porous conductive carbon fabrics for the aqueous electrochemical reduction of CO2. The catalysts exhibited high ηCO and TONCO, and long stabilities. The microcrystalline COF deposited on carbon fabrics33 showed larger porous, more dispersed Co centers and higher TON, but lower selectivity and lower ηCO, and it suffered low active sites' ratio (4% of the total catalyst on the surface) caused by aggregation. Even though, they are among the most active catalysts (Fig. 4) with TONCO ≈ 48000 per active site in 24 h with ηCO = 83% and ηH2 = 24%.

Electrode functionalization by electropolymerization
If the catalyst bears a suitable group able to polymerize, the electrode surface can be easily modified by electropolymerization.35,36 Portenkirchner and coworkers37,38 electropolymerized a 5,5′-bisphenylethynyl bipyridyl Re complex on the electrode surface, as a potential catalyst for CO2 reduction. However, the homogeneous and the heterogeneous catalyst showed in CH3CN solutions relatively low ηCO for CO2 reduction, 45% and 33%, respectively. We very recently exploited the electropolymerization properties of Re(bpy) complexes containing the thiophene moiety that have the advantage to produce an electron-conducting film, with interesting results.39
The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 on an ITO electrode covered with the cobalt 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin (Co-TAPP) polymer in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMImBF4) as a novel reaction medium40 occurred at a particularly positive potential, −0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which means a significant energy gain in the electrochemical fixation of CO2. Only CO was detected by gas chromatography, with ηCO = 64.9% and TON = 69 for 4 h. Later, Zn(II) and Fe(III) were used as catalysts using the same procedure,41 but while the electropolymerized Fe porphyrin was active toward CO2 reduction, the corresponding Zn derivative was poorly active.
Electrode functionalization by chemical bonds
The formation of covalent chemical bonds between the catalyst and the surface imparts particular stability to the modified electrodes. Cobalt porphyrin complexes bearing peripheral acetylene groups were covalently linked to the boron-doped p-type conductive crystalline diamond electrode surface decorated with alkyl azides.42 The modified diamond surface was used as a “smart” electrode, exhibiting good stability and electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to CO in acetonitrile solution.
Very recently, the electrochemical behavior of a GC prepared by simple and direct functionalization of terpyridine containing diazonium salts was explored.43 This versatile strategy allows us to extend the use of such modified electrodes through the reversible coordination of a variety of metal ions; for example cobalt centers have been tested for the CO2 reduction, with TONCO = 70 for 30 min.43
Conclusions

Table 1 summarizes the properties of the electrodes herein considered. Often organic metal complexes anchored on modified electrodes exhibit better Turn Over Number, faradic efficiencies, stability, and/or less negative overpotentials compared with the corresponding complexes in homogeneous solution, highlighting the beneficial effect of the immobilization. Physical attachment of catalysts on the surface by Nafion, polymer membrane or nanoparticles, etc. would have the drawback of a lower number of active sites on the surface because part of the catalyst embedded in the solid structure may be hidden to the reaction. Conversely, the monolayer of covalently chemically bonded species or adsorbed polymer (produced also by electropolymerization) has less total amount of active sites, but potentially better electron conduction properties. Although no general rule can be suggested at this stage of the research, the best solution appears to adopt electrodes with the largest surface area, in order to maximize the amount of active catalyst in contact with the reactive interface. Hence, the new electrode modification methods by a novel hybrid electrode material via the covalent organic framework approach seem to be quite promising. The challenge is to provide an adequate transport of materials (to and from the catalytic center) and electrons (via a conductive material) to the active surface.

Recent studies suggested that the dispersed catalyst could exhibit much better activity than the concentrated ones, such that the complexes with pores or localized in the porous matrix may arise from the more free catalytic environment around the catalyst center, or because reaction products may interfere with the catalytic cycle. The gas diffusion electrode approach that adopts the conductive black carbon is also appealing, due to the gaseous nature of CO2 that would allow the direct reaction without the need for using an organic solvent for CO2 solutions. Thus the covalent organic framework and gas diffusion electrode approaches are actually the most efficient ones in terms of TON, selectivity, and durability, and appear to be suitable to be embedded in a photo-electrochemical cell for CO2 reduction.
From this point of view the research field appears to be promising and mostly unexplored, when compared to the homogeneous counterpart. The use of intact transition metal complexes anchored to the conducting surface appears to be one of the main research fields that would allow a competitive development of Photo-Electrochemical solar cells for selective CO2 conversion, allowing the molecular design of the catalysts. The investigation of proton assisted multi-electron reduction in different solvents may significantly alter the selectivity, and it seems to be the preferred pathway to follow, due to benefits in decreasing the reduction overpotentials and increasing selectivity.
Although, a lot of efforts have been made in the heterogeneous CO2 reduction, the elucidation of the mechanism is still obscure compared with the homogeneous, and the catalytic pathways seldom discussed, even there are some studies that mention the use of Infrared45 or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.40 The knowledge of the mechanism will certainly help the design of more efficient catalysts and systems. So there are plenty of research opportunities ranging from molecular or solid state calculations, in in situ spectroscopic techniques, and especially electrochemical techniques that allow us to study the chemical reaction at the interfaces.
