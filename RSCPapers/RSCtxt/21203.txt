1. Introduction
Energy is one of the most significant concerns in the 21st century and is ultimately related to our daily life and global economy. Although traditional combustion-based energy will continue to play a dominant role in meeting our demands in the near future, the imminent shortage, increasing price, and growing environmental pollution of fossil fuels are pushing humans to develop sustainable, low-cost, and clean energy (e.g. solar energy, wind energy, tidal energy, and hydrogen energy).1–3 In this regard, various electrochemical energy storage/conversion technologies, such as lithium/sodium/magnesium-ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs/MIBs), supercapacitors (SCs), metal–air batteries (MABs), hydrogen evolution and storage techniques, are becoming more appealing than ever.4–6 In the last few decades, these energy-related systems have witnessed rapid advances and great potential in many applications, including portable electronics, hybrid/pure electric vehicles, smart grids and so on.7–13 However, in addition to LIBs, the widespread commercialization of these innovative technologies is still greatly hampered by their poor safety, insufficient duration, and operability problems, which are intrinsically related to severe materials challenges. Therefore, elaborate exploration and rational design of appropriate materials that can increase the safety, improve the durability, and enhance the efficiency will be of great significance to make these promising energy-related technologies commercially viable.
Metal sulfides (denoted as MSs) are attracting considerable attention in a variety of energy devices due to their diverse structural types and fascinating electrochemical activities.14–17 Generally, they are abundant and cheap since they usually exist in nature as minerals such as molybdenite (MoS2), tungstenite (WS2), heazlewoodite (Ni3S2), chalcocite (Cu2S), pyrite (FeS2) and so on; this is beneficial for exploiting large-scale facilities. MSs with layered structure (e.g. MoS2, TiS2, WS2, SnS2) could be exfoliated to graphene-like structures, which exhibit distinctively different physical and chemical properties in comparison with their bulk counterparts.18–20 Graphene-like MSs can offer open channels for ionic/electronic transportation and provide abundant active sites for ion/charge storage, and hence they have been considered as promising host materials in lithium/sodium/magnesium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. MSs with non-layered structure (e.g. FeS2, CoSx, CuS, Sb2S3) occur with multi-electron redox reactions as electrode materials for batteries and capacitors, which usually show high capacity. In addition, metal sulfides are emerging as efficient non-noble metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), playing an important role in fuel cells, metal–air batteries and hydrogen utilization. A wide range of applications of MSs are profited from their innate physical/chemical merits and the tailored morphologies, structures, sizes, and compositions.
As is well known, some other interstitial compounds such as metal oxides (MOs), metal carbides (MCs), and metal nitrides (MNs) also show potentialities for high-efficiency energy storage/conversion, while metal sulfides (MSs) possess some intrinsic advantages compared with them. MSs are usually semiconductors with better electrical conductivity than their oxide counterparts.21 In particular, layered MSs could be exfoliated to few-layered structures, which even display metallic conductivity. Moreover, layered MSs often provide appropriate interlayer spacing to enable fast and stable ion intercalation/de-intercalation. This is of great benefit for achieving high-rate and long-life electrodes of secondary batteries. Generally speaking, MSs especially with the layered structure are more likely to expose active sites for H adsorption than MOs,22 leading to their superior electro-catalytic performance for the HER. Recently, MCs and MNs have also been considered as efficient electro-catalysts for the ORR and the HER,23 but their fabrication usually requires a multistep process and high temperature treatment, which makes the synthesis costly, complicated, or even uneconomical. To give an overall consideration, MSs are multifunctional materials and paying attention to their progress in energy-related applications towards more improvements is desired and necessary.
Apart from the inherent advantages of MSs, it is well established that the composition, crystalline phase, structural and morphological features of functional materials, and the surface/interface properties between the electrode and electrolyte would also greatly influence the performance of these distinctive MSs in energy-related systems. Therefore, there is an urgent need but still a significant challenge to rationally design and delicately synthesize electroactive MSs for advanced LIBs, SIBs, MIBs, SCs, MABs, and hydrogen utilization. In order to display such a “structure–function” relationship, in this review, we mainly address the topic of the ingenious design and controllable synthesis of unique MSs for high-efficiency electrochemical energy storage/conversion. To make it a feasible task, we will introduce the recent progress in metal sulfides in four parts, that is, “Lithium-ion batteries”, “Next-generation batteries and supercapacitors”, “Oxygen reduction reaction”, and “Hydrogen-related applications”. The advantages and limitations will be discussed, and the corresponding problem-solving strategies associated with structural/compositional engineering will also be highlighted. Finally, we propose some personal prospects with the aim of shedding light on the further development of advanced MSs for high-performance electrochemical energy storage/conversion technologies.
2. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have experienced great development since their commercialization in 1990.24–26 Recently, LIBs have become the main power sources for portable electronic devices, and they are also the most reliable energy storage systems for electric vehicles and smart grids.1 However, as the anode for commercial LIBs, graphite has a theoretic capacity of only 372 mA h g−1, which inevitably results in a low energy density. Thus, a variety of electrode materials have been designed and tailored to manage the challenges. Among the numerous candidates, metal sulfides (MSs) have huge application potential in LIBs owing to their high lithium storage capacity, low cost, and long cycling life.27,28 In this section, we will introduce the design and preparation of various metal sulfides and their application in LIBs. The merits, shortages, and the corresponding solutions will be described. Moreover, the reaction mechanism will also be specifically discussed. Generally speaking, metal sulfides for batteries could be divided into two types: layered and non-layered structures.
2.1 Layered metal sulfides
Layered metal sulfides (MSs, where M = Mo, W, Sn, Ti, V) are composed of three stacked atom layers (S–M–S). In these compounds, atoms within layers are bound by covalent bonds, while the individual layers are held together through van der Waals forces. Such layered structures offer a convenient environment for the accommodation of guest ions (such as Li+, Na+, and Mg2+). However, the practical application of MSs as anode materials is still hindered due to their relatively low electric conductivity and large volume changes. In addition, just like Li–S batteries, a polysulfide shuttling effect may result in the electrochemical degradation of MSs.29
Since MoS2 was first evaluated as a Li-storage electrode material in 1980,30 various morphologies and structures of MoS2 have been applied for LIBs. It is known that Li+ reacts with MoS2 within the voltage window of 3.0–0.01 V. In the range of 3.0–1.1 V, Li+ ions intercalate into MoS2 layers to form LixMoS2 according to eqn (1), and this corresponds to the reduction peak at ∼1.1 V in cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves (Fig. 2a).31,32In situ X-ray diffraction verifies that: with the increasing concentration of Li, a glide process between the Mo and S plane occurs, leading to a phase change from 2H-LixMoS2 to 1T-LixMoS2 (Fig. 1a–c).33,34 During the range of 1.1–0.01 V, Li+ reacts with LixMoS2 to form Mo metal and Li2S (Fig. 1d) through a conversion reaction (eqn (2)), showing a reduction peak at ∼0.6 V in the CV curve. However, the capacity and cycling performance of bulk MoS2 are unsatisfactory, because conversion from MoS2 to Mo leads to structural instability. For example, Miki et al. synthesized bulk MoS2 through the decomposition of (NH4)2MoS4, delivering a low capacity of 100 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.35 MoS2 + xLi+ + xe− ↔ LixMoS2(1) LixMoS2 + (4 − x)Li+ + (4 − x)e− ↔ Mo + 2Li2S(2)

SnS2 (SnS) is also a kind of attractive electrode material for LIBs. The lithiation of SnS2 (SnS) occurs through two steps: firstly, with the intercalation of Li, SnS2 (SnS) transforms into metallic Sn and Li2S; then Sn alloys with Li to form Li4.4Sn.36 The first step results in large irreversible capacity in the initial cycles, while the second step contributes to the reversible theoretical capacity of 645 (782) mA h g−1 (as shown in Fig. 2b).36,37 In contrast, a new mechanism through which partial Li2S arising from the first step could be reversibly delithiated was also proposed, and this was responsible for the extended-capacity of SnS2 (SnS).38,39 The main difficulty is that Sn-based anodes often suffer from a large volume change and electrode pulverization, leading to poor cycling stability.
Recently, WS2 has been widely investigated due to its similarity to MoS2. The typical CV behavior of WS2 is shown in Fig. 2c; during the first cycle, the cathodic peak at 0.4 V can be ascribed to the formation of metallic W embedded in Li2S and the decomposition of the electrolyte, and the anodic peak around 2.4 V is assigned to the oxidation of W to WS2. In the subsequent cycles, the cathodic peaks around 2.1 and 1.8 V are ascribed to the formation of LixWS2 through intercalation reaction.40,41 Similar to other MSs, the low electronic conductivity and the structural damage during conversion reaction severely hamper the practical application of WS2.42 For example, bulk WS2 only exhibited a low capacity of 88.5 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 100 cycles.41 Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) computation indicated that VS2 was also a possible anode material for LIBs. It can stably adsorb Li up to Li2VS2 (corresponding to a high theoretical capacity of 466 mA h g−1), and has a higher Li diffusion rate than MoS2.43 Very recently, an all-solid-state TiS2/Li battery using LiBH4 as the electrolyte has also been developed.44
To circumvent the obstacles facing layered MSs, numerous strategies have been put forward. The first effective approach is to exfoliate bulk MSs into few-layered or even single-layered MSs, which were named graphene-like structures by Rao et al.18 Graphene-like MSs are loosely stacked and therefore can accommodate the volume changes and, provide open channels for Li+ ion diffusion. Two widely applied fabrication procedures are mechanical and liquid phase exfoliation.38,45 For example, Guo's group prepared restacked MoS2 with an enlarged c lattice parameter by the hydrolysis of lithiated MoS2 (LiMoS2). The increased interlayer spacing and surface area could lower the barriers to Li+ mobility, thereby facilitating the intercalation reaction.46 MoS2 nanoplates consisting of disordered graphene-like layers, with an enlarged inter-layered distance of 0.69 nm, were also synthesized by Hwang et al., showing an excellent rate capability of 700 mA h g−1 even at 50 C (53.1 A g−1).47 Wang et al. developed SnS2@PANI nanoflakes through in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline on the surface of ultrasonic exfoliated SnS2 nanoplates.38 As shown in Fig. 3a, it delivered a high capacity of 934.2 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and 356.1 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1. Moreover, Kim's group synthesized WS2 single layers embedded in nitrogen-doped nanofibers through a facile electrospinning method.48 When used as the anode for LIBs, it delivered discharge capacities of 502 and 437.5 mA h g−1 at the 2nd and 200th cycles, respectively.

The second choice is to construct composites of MSs and carbonaceous materials (or conductive polymers), such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs),49 carbon nanosheets,32 amorphous carbon,50 graphene,31,51,52 poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO),53 and polyaniline (PANI).38 Carbon matrices can greatly ameliorate the electric conductivity, buffer the volume fluctuation, and inhibit the aggregation of exfoliated MSs.54 MoS2/graphene nanosheet (GNS) composites were prepared by Chen's group via a feasible hydrothermal method, which exhibited an extraordinary capacity of up to 1300 mA h g−1.31 Furthermore, Chang et al. clarified the growth mechanism of MoS2 on the surface of N-doped graphene.52 Wang and co-workers fabricated a MoS2–CNT composite film and, the MoS2-50 wt% CNT film with a thickness of 1 μm showed the best performance, delivering a capacity of 992 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles (Fig. 3b).54 Very recently, Tu and colleagues prepared MoS2 nanosheets wrapped by a conductive polypyrrole (PPy) layer and closely incorporated within reduced graphene oxide (rGO). As a binder-free electrode for LIBs, this MoS2–PPy–rGO composite could maintain a capacity of 1070 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 200 mA g−1.55 Nevertheless, the MS–carbon composites often suffer from limited interface efficiency. To address this problem, Jiang et al. reported a two-dimensional (2D) monolayer MoS2–carbon interoverlapped superstructure, it can maximize the atomic interface contact between single-layered MoS2 and carbon nanosheets.56 He's group proposed a novel and scalable 2D spatial confinement strategy for the synthesis of few-layered MoS2 anchored on three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon nanosheets, demonstrating a remarkable long cycling life at high rates.32 Our group also prepared a graphene-like MoS2/graphene nanocomposite by a lithiation-assisted exfoliation method, incorporating the advantages of few-layered structure and carbon coating.57 Besides, an ultrathin SnS2/GNS nanocomposite was fabricated by Sathish and co-workers, where SnS2 nanoplates (with a typical size of ∼2 nm) were evenly distributed on the surface of loosely packed graphene.58 The common phenomenon that SnS2–graphene systems showed higher specific capacities than the theoretical capacity of SnS2 could be explained based on the synergistic effect between SnS2 and graphene. More impressively, first-principles calculations revealed that when WS2 was composited with GNS, the synergistic effect between them would provide an electron-rich environment, which could efficiently increase the binding energy of Li+ insertion and favor the following de-lithiation process. Moreover, the calculated results of the nudged elastic band (NEB) method manifested that the energy barrier for Li in WS2@graphene was much lower than that in pristine WS2.59 Different from the aforementioned MSs, VS2/GNS can be evaluated as both an anode and a cathode. In the range of 1.5–3.5 V, VS2/GNS maintained a capacity of 160.9 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles, while during 0.05–4 V, it exhibited a capacity of 525.3 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.60
Modification of structure and morphology is another powerful method to improve the electrochemical performance of MSs. As is well known, nano-structural engineering is beneficial for enlarging the surface area, shortening the diffusion path for Li+ transport, and alleviating the volume change, thus contributing to improving Li-storage properties.48 In addition, fabricating hierarchical hybrids will also enable increased electrochemical performance due to their large surface area, 3D interconnected structure and highly conductive substrates.39,47,52,61 Lately, numerous nanostructured MSs with diverse appearances, such as nanosheets,37 nanobelts,39 hierarchical microspheres (Fig. 4a),62 hierarchical nanowires (Fig. 4b),63 and nanotubes (Fig. 4c),64 have been designed through a variety of synthetic routes. To be specific, David Lou's group synthesized hierarchical MoS2 nanosheets supported on carbon spheres,62 which simultaneously integrated the compositional and structural design rationales for high-performance anode materials. When applied in LIBs, the MoS2@C microspheres displayed high specific capacity and excellent rate capability. The hierarchical hybrids, MoS2 grown on 3D graphene networks52 or graphene foam,61 were also creatively built, and they can be directly exploited as anodes for LIBs without a binder; this could further enhance the electronic conductivity and power density of the systems. Yu and colleagues prepared a free-standing SnS@polypyrrole nanobelt/carbon-nanotube (SnS@PPy-NB/CNT) paper,39 where one-dimensional CNTs and SnS@PPy nanobelts were homogeneously interconnected. Owing to its superior porous and conductive properties, this electrode exhibited a high capacity of 757 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles. Amine's group successfully fabricated tungsten disulfide nanotube (WS2-NT)/graphene (GS) sandwiched architecture as the anode for LIBs.64 This hybrid demonstrated high capacities of 692.6 mA h g−1 and 393.5 mA h g−1 at the rate of 0.1 and 1 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 3c).

2.2 Non-layered metal sulfides
Non-layered metal sulfides, such as FeS2, NiS2, CoS2, and GeS, have also attracted great research interest due to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, they also suffer from huge volume variation, sluggish reaction kinetics, and detrimental side reactions.
Pyrite (FeS2), the most studied non-layered metal sulfide, is a potential candidate to replace traditional LiMO2 (M = Mn, Co, Ni etc.) intercalation cathodes owing to its high theoretical capacity of 894 mA h g−1 (four-electron transfer). The lithiation mechanism of FeS2 can be explained combining with the charge/discharge curves. As shown in Fig. 2d, from the second cycles, the discharge platforms around 2.1 and 1.5 V are attributed to the intercalation process of Li+ (eqn (3)) and the conversion reaction (eqn (4)), respectively. The charge platforms around 1.8 and 2.4 V belong to the electrochemical reaction in eqn (5) and the oxidation of S2− to S (eqn (6)), respectively. Son et al. observed orthorhombic-FeS2 as a full charge product.65 It should be pointed out that FeS2 usually faces problems of severe volume expansion and polysulfide dissolution, resulting in limited reversibility of the Li–FeS2 system.66 To improve its electrochemical performance, there are three main strategies. Firstly, much effort has been devoted to embedding FeS2 in a conductive matrix. Maier and co-workers developed carbon-encapsulated pyrite with short Li+ diffusion distance, excellent electronic conductivity and outstanding structural stability (Fig. 4d).67 The obtained FeS2@C porous nanooctahedra showed a capacity of 439 mA h g−1 at 894 mA g−1 (1 C) and a remarkable capacity retention of 90% at 447 mA g−1 after 50 cycles (Fig. 3d). Secondly, nano-structuring has also been demonstrated to be an effective approach by increasing the electrode/electrolyte contact area and accommodating the absolute strain during cycling. A case study is that, phase-pure pyrite nanowires were prepared via thermal sulfidation of the α-FeF3·H2O precursor, revealing good cyclic capability in 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)/tetra(ethylene glycol)dimethyl ether (TEGDME) electrolyte.68 Lastly, it has been proved that the electrolyte also plays an important role in determining the electrode behavior. Evans et al. found that the TFSI-based ionic liquid as electrolyte could effectively suppress polysulfide dissolution and the parasitic redox shuttle mechanism.69 Chen's group reported that the Li/FeS2 battery with ether-based LiTFSI/diglyme (DGM) as the electrolyte exhibited a much better electrochemical performance than that with the LiPF6/ethylene carbonate–diethyl carbonate (EC–DEC) electrolyte and showed a high capacity retention of 90% after 100 cycles at 1 A g−1.70 The main reason is that the side reaction between polysulfides and electrolyte was inhibited. In addition, FeS2 has also been investigated as the anode for LIBs in the potential window of 0.01–2.5 V.71 Discharge: FeS2 + 2Li+ + 2e− → Li2FeS2(3) Li2FeS2 + 2Li+ + 2e− → Fe + 2Li2S(4) Charge: Fe + 2Li2S → Li2FeS2 + 2Li+ + 2e−(5) Li2FeS2 → 0.8FeS2 + 0.2FeS8/7 + 6/35S + 2Li+ + 2e−(6)
Nickel sulfides are also versatile materials that can be used as both the cathode and the anode for LIBs. Under deep discharge, nickel sulfides can react with Li+ to form Ni and Li2S with high theoretical capacities of 590, 445, and 704 mA h g−1 for NiS, Ni2S3, and Ni3S4, respectively. However, the first study of nickel sulfides for LIBs only showed a low utilization rate.72 Recently, various strategies, such as nanotechnology, carbon-coating, and morphology modification, have been adopted to improve their electrochemical properties.73,74 A submicrometer Ni3S2/Ni4 composite on a Cu foil was obtained by electrodeposition, when used as a cathode for LIBs; it delivered a high specific capacity of 180 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 1.7 A g−1 (6C).75 Then, Mahmood et al. prepared the Ni3S4/GNS composite via a hydrothermal method and it can be further converted into NiS1.03/GN after heating at 350 °C. Both the two composites showed better cycling stability than bare Ni3S4 as anode materials for LIBs.73 Wang and co-workers embedded β-NiS nanoparticles (with a typical size of 50 nm) in porous carbon matrices by calcinating MOF-74(Ni) under reducing environments. The obtained material was characterized with small particle size, homogeneous distribution, specific porosity, and high surface area, which are favorable for Li-storage.74
Additionally, cobalt sulfides (CoS2 and CoS) have also been explored. In situ TEM demonstrated that the reaction mechanism in Li–CoS2 batteries is a reversible phase conversion between CoS2 and Co/Li2S.76 Our group synthesized uniform CoS2 hollow spheres, flower-like CoS hierarchitectures, and CoS microspheres through facile solvothermal methods.77,78 Furthermore, the formation mechanisms of their structures were discussed in detail. More impressively, Cho et al. found that the crystalline GeS and GeS2 nanoparticles (NPs) displayed ultrahigh capacities of 1010 and 740 mA h g−1, respectively, which were superior to their amorphous counterparts. It should be mentioned that the generated tetragonal Ge can further alloy with Li+ reversibly.79
3. Next generation batteries and supercapacitors
3.1 Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs)
Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as the most promising alternatives to LIBs, especially for a large-scale energy storage system (ESS), due to their advantages of abundant sodium resources, low cost, and similar working mechanisms to LIBs.8,80 However, the larger and heavier Na+ ions (radius 1.02 Å, mass 22.99 g mol−1) as compared to Li+ ions (radius 0.59 Å, mass 6.94 g mol−1) make it difficult to identify appropriate electrode materials with the capability of fast and stable sodium-ion insertion/extraction. As an effective strategy, metal sulfides have been tried on account of their appealing Na-storage properties.
MoS2 can reversibly accommodate Na+, making it a promising candidate as an SIB anode material. Ahn's group firstly reported the Na-storage performance and mechanism of bulk MoS2.81 Then, Wang and colleagues manifested the phase transition from 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2 during Na+ insertion at the atomic scale using an aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM).82 It was found that the structure of MoS2 could be partially restored if <1.5 Na+ per formula MoS2 were intercalated (eqn (7)). Nevertheless, with further Na+ intercalation, it was decomposed to NaxS and Mo metal (eqn (8)) and its structure could not be recovered anymore. Recently, Wang's group also observed the reversible phase transition from 2H-MoS2 to 1T-MoS2 during the sodium-ion intercalation/de-intercalation process by in situ Raman spectroscopy.83 Gao et al. found that the typical velocity of the phase boundary was 3–7 nm s−1 for Na+ insertion in MoS2, this was 1 order slower than Li+ diffusion, demonstrating the sluggish kinetics of Na+ ions.84 Moreover, a planar microscale battery was created to investigate the topographic changes in MoS2 during cycling. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the permanent wrinkling behavior of MoS2 upon sodiation was observed at 0.4 V, while SEI formation occurred at around 1.5 V before Na+ intercalation. And the quantitative data of SEI thickness for sodiated MoS2 was firstly measured to be 20.4 nm ± 10.9 nm by force spectroscopy.85 Based on the above exploration, numerous modified MoS2 with improved electrochemical performance have been synthesized.86–90 For example, Yu and Maier prepared single-layered ultrasmall MoS2 nanoplates (lateral dimension: ∼4 nm, thickness: 0.4 nm) embedded in thin carbon nanofibers (Fig. 5a–d).86 For sodium storage, an ultrahigh capacity of 854 mA h g−1 was obtained at 0.1 A g−1, and the specific capacity was 484 and 253 mA h g−1 at 1 and 10 A g−1 after 100 cycles, respectively. The restriction to ultrasmall reaction domains allowed for an almost diffusion-less and nucleation-free “conversion”, thereby resulting in remarkable electrochemical properties. Then, Kang's group obtained few-layered MoS2 coated with 3D graphene microspheres through a one-pot spray pyrolysis process, displaying a high and stable coulombic efficiency of 99.98% as a Na-storage anode material.87 Chou and co-workers optimized the electrolyte system, finding that MoS2/C in 1.0 M NaClO4 with PC/EC + FEC exhibited high reversible capacity and rate capability.88 Wang's group fabricated MoS2/C nanospheres and extended the cycling life to 300 cycles.89 The cyclic stability of MoS2 was further improved to 1500 cycles by controlling the cut-off voltage to 0.4–3 V, during which only a reversible intercalation reaction occurred.90 MoS2 + xNa+ + xe− ↔ NaxMoS2(7) NaxMoS2 + (4 − x)Na+ + (4 − x)e− ↔ Mo + 2Na2S(8)

Apart from MoS2, many other layered metal sulfides such as SnS2, WS2, and TiS2 were also widely investigated as electrode materials of SIBs. Lee and co-workers synthesized a SnS2–rGO composite and achieved excellent electrochemical performance.91 This can be attributed to the SnS2 layered structure that could better accommodate the volume change in Na–Sn insertion and de-insertion; as well as the good conductivity and mechanical resilience of rGO. Our group also developed a SnS2/graphene nanocomposite,92 where SnS2 nanoplates composed of 2–5 layers were uniformly decorated on the surface of graphene (Fig. 5e). This unique structure could simultaneously facilitate Na+ diffusion, suppress the aggregation and pulverization of active materials during cycling, thus guaranteeing high Na-storage performance. Guo and colleagues found that SnS experienced a two-structural-phase transformation during the sodiation process (orthorhombic-SnS to cubic-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn), while SnS2 experienced a three-structural-phase transformation (hexagonal SnS2 to tetragonal-Sn to orthorhombic-Na3.75Sn). The less structural changes of SnS were beneficial for good cycling stability.93 In addition, WS2 nanowires (WS2 NWs) with a thin diameter (∼25 nm) and expanded interlayer spacing (0.83 nm) were also reported by our group (Fig. 5g).94 We found that in the voltage range of 0.5–3 V, WS2 NWs followed a reversible intercalation-type mechanism with the nanowire framework being well maintained. The gradually expanded and exfoliated interlayers not only facilitated the electron and Na+ ion diffusion kinetics, but also provided more active sites for Na-storage. Therefore, an ultra-long cycling life and a high rate capability of WS2 NWs were realized.
Non-layered metal sulfides, especially FeS2, Sb2S3, and CoS2, are also of interest in SIBs. Kim et al. firstly applied pyrite (natural FeS2) for SIBs but the capacity declined quickly from 630 to 85 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles.95 Afterward, Kitajou et al. explored the reaction mechanism between FeS2 and Na. Firstly, Na+ intercalated into FeS2 to form NaxFeS2 (x < 2.0), then NaxFeS2 (x > 2) converted to Na2S and metallic Fe.96 Generally, the latter conversion reaction caused severe volume variation and sluggish kinetics for the Na–FeS2 system, leading to inferior cycling performance. To solve this problem, Chen's group prepared FeS2 microspheres (Fig. 5h) and skillfully avoided the detrimental conversion-type reaction by adopting a compatible NaSO3CF3/diglyme electrolyte and adjusting the terminal voltage to 0.8 V. As a result, an unprecedented long-life cyclability (∼90% capacity retention after 20000 cycles) and admirable high-rate capability (170 mA h g−1 at rate of 20 A g−1) were achieved.97
Based on the fascinating Na-storage performance of metallic Sb, Sb2S3 is also electrochemically active for sodiation/desodiation. It first undergoes a conversion reaction to produce Sb metal and Na2S (eqn (9)), and then an alloy reaction (eqn (10)). This corresponds to a high theoretical capacity of 946 mA h g−1 (12 moles Na+ per mole of Sb2S3). Bulk Sb2S3 could accommodate ∼12 Na+ in the first discharge, but fewer than 50% Na+ ions could be extracted. In order to fully employ the potential of Sb2S3, Yu et al. resoundingly fabricated the Sb2S3 nanoparticle decorated graphene composite as the anode for SIBs. It provided an ultrahigh capacity of 730 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, and 520 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 3000 mA g−1, corresponding to a charge and discharge time of ∼10 min, adequate for high rate applications. The surprising performance was owing to the fast Na+ diffusion and good electrical transport in this system.98 Subsequently, the amorphous Sb2S3-graphite electrode with a rarely reported high initial coulombic efficiency of 84% was constructed.99 In addition, CoS2 for SIBs has also been attempted. Shadike et al. obtained CoS2/multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) nanocomposites by a simple hydrothermal method (as shown in Fig. 5f).100 It was shown that the Na storage properties of CoS2/MWCNTs in an ether-based electrolyte (NaCF3SO3-DGE) were superior to that in a commonly used ester-based electrolyte (NaClO4-EC/PC). Sb2S3 + 6Na+ + 6e− → 2Sb + 3Na2S(9) 2Sb + 6Na+ + 6e− → 2Na3Sb(10)
3.2 Magnesium-ion batteries (MIBs)
Rechargeable Mg batteries have shown the potential for reversible electrochemical energy storage and conversion owing to their characteristics of high theoretical specific capacity (2205 mA h g−1), good operational safety, environmental friendliness, great material abundance, and low price.9,101 However, in comparison to Li-ion batteries, the major obstacles for rechargeable Mg batteries are the kinetically sluggish Mg insertion/extraction in cathode materials and the anode/electrolyte incompatibility due to the high polarizing ability of the divalent Mg2+ cation.102 The search for suitable cathode and less passivated anode materials is intrinsically challenging, and only a few materials deliver reasonable capacity and cyclability.103 In the past decade, metal sulfides have played an important role in promoting the progress of MIBs. Aurbach's group reported a Chevrel phase Mo6S8;104 this cathode exhibited excellent magnesium insertion/extraction performance with a reversible capacity of 90–100 mA h g−1 for more than 70 cycles, which boosted the development of rechargeable Mg batteries to a new level. Then, Tao et al. discovered the reversible intercalation/de-intercalation behavior of Mg2+ in TiS2 nanotubes,105 and a capacity of 236 mA h g−1 was obtained, corresponding to the formation of Mg0.49TiS2. Afterward, layered MoS2 was extensively studied as the host material for Mg2+. Chen's group combined the highly exfoliated, graphene-like MoS2 (G-MoS2) cathode (Fig. 6a) with the ultrasmall Mg nanoparticle (N-Mg) anode (Fig. 6b) for MIBs;106 this configuration displayed an operating voltage of 1.8 V (Fig. 6c) and a good reversible capacity of ca. 170 mA h g−1 (Fig. 6d), much better than that of the bulk MoS2 (B-MoS2)–bulk Mg (B-Mg) configuration, emphasizing the necessity of rational morphology and structure control of electrode materials, and opening up new opportunities for rechargeable Mg batteries. Recently, our group prepared sandwich-structured MoS2/C and MoS2/graphene microspheres,107,108 realizing the stable, reversible Mg2+ intercalation/de-intercalation in MoS2 with bulk Mg; this significantly improved the operational safety since nano-Mg is very active and combustible. Liang et al. inserted a controlled amount of poly(ethylene oxide) into the lattice of MoS2 and increased its interlayer distance from 0.62 nm to 1.45 nm;109 this effectively facilitated the Mg2+ diffusion kinetics in MoS2 thus good rate capability was achieved. In addition, Pereira's group employed the first-principles calculations to explore the electrochemical behavior of MoS2, WS2, and TiS2 in rechargeable Mg batteries,110 further suggesting their high ion mobility and application potentialities.

3.3 Supercapacitors (SCs)
As an intermediate system between electrostatic capacitors and batteries, supercapacitors (SCs) have emerged with great potential to meet the demand of energy storage/conversion due to their fast charge and discharge, high power density, long cycle life, and relatively low cost.10,111 Research results indicate that the capacitive properties of SCs are influenced by electrodes, electrolytes, and the assembly technology, with the most important factor being the electrode materials. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop suitable electrode materials with high specific capacitance, good rate capability, and high cycling stability.112,113 Metal sulfides are a good choice based on their favorable faradic redox reactions. Among them, cobalt sulfides (CoxSy) are considered as the most promising pseudocapacitive materials. Since the electrochemical performance largely depends on the morphology, structure, and surface area of the electrode material, controlled synthesis of cobalt sulfide nanostructures with a large surface area is vitally important. Shi et al. presented an electrodeposition process to fabricate a 3D CoS/graphene hybrid on Ni foam (Fig. 7a),114 of which the nanosheet-like CoS was tightly wrapped by the graphene layer, leading to increased conductivity and enlarged electroactive surface area. The CoS/graphene composites exhibited an impressive specific capacitance of 3785 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, a favorable rate capability with 82% retention at 20 A g−1, and 70% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. Wang's group also prepared a CoS2–graphene nanocomposite by a facile solvothermal method,115 of which CoS2 nanoparticles with sizes of 5–15 nm were densely anchored on graphene nanosheets (Fig. 7b). When tested as an electrode material for supercapacitors, the CoS2–graphene delivered specific capacitances of 314 F g−1 in the aqueous electrolyte and 141 F g−1 in the organic electrolyte at 0.5 A g−1 with excellent cyclic stability, much better than that of the bare CoS2 nanoparticles or graphene nanosheets. Then, David Lou and colleagues reported the synthesis of porous CoS2 ellipsoids with tube-like cavities that are oriented from the center to the surface (Fig. 7c).116 Such anisotropic cavities would not only facilitate the infiltration of electrolyte but also provide a more active surface when the CoS2 ellipsoids were evaluated as electrode materials for supercapacitors, thus displaying high pseudocapacitance and good cycling performance. Our group reported the synthesis of Co3S4 hollow nanospheres that were grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO, Fig. 7d) and their electrode application for advanced supercapacitors.117 This nanocomposite demonstrated high specific capacitances of 675.9 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 521.7 F g−1 at 5 A g−1; after 1000 cycles, 90% capacitance was retained. Additionally, Rakhi et al. evaluated Co9S8 nanoflakes and octahedra as electrode materials for SCs;118 the effect of morphology on performance was discussed, revealing that Co9S8 nanoflakes (Fig. 7e) with a larger specific area showed higher capacitance and better cycling stability over 5000 cycles.

Binary metal sulfides have also been tried, for the first time, Xiao et al. prepared NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays on a flexible carbon fiber paper for supercapacitors,119 and excellent electrochemical performance was achieved owing to the unique nanoarchitecture and the intrinsically high electrical conductivity of NiCo2S4. In comparison, Li et al. built novel Ni3S2@CoS core–shell nano-triangular pyramid arrays by electrodeposition.120 This tailored nanostructure provided an ultra-thin CoS shell to enlarge active areas, introduced good conductivity and short transportation lengths for both ions and electrons, thus improving the performance of Ni3S2.
In addition to CoxSy, some other metal sulfides have also shown high electrochemical activities in supercapacitors. For example, Zheng's group synthesized a hierarchical flower-like β-NiS architecture and evaluated it as an electrode material for supercapacitors;121 high specific discharge capacitances of 857.76 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and 512.96 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 were obtained. In comparison, Sun et al. embedded α-NiS nanoparticles in carbon nanorods,122 rendering higher capacitance than that of β-NiS, with 1092 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 740 F g−1 at 10 A g−1. More impressively, the capacitance retention after 2000 cycles was approximately 100%. Afterward, 3D Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays and mushroom-like Ni3S2 were successfully fabricated,123,124 which also displayed promising electrochemical properties as pseudocapacitive materials. Nowadays, copper sulfides are receiving increasing attention as electrode materials for supercapacitors, ultrafine CuS nanoneedles (5–10 nm in diameter, 100–150 nm in length) supported on the carbon nanotube backbone,125 and ultrasmall Cu1.96S nanoparticles (∼10 nm) homogenously embedded in porous carbon octahedra were prepared,126 both exhibiting high capacitance and excellent cycling stability. Very recently, Tang et al. used MnS nanocrystals as supercapacitor materials, showing a high capacitance of 704.5 F g−1 and 62.6% retention after 5000 cycles.127
It is not difficult to find that two-dimensional (2D) graphene is often composed of active materials to offer a larger electroactive surface area and a better electric conductivity.128 Hence, another type of 2D semiconductor, MoS2, was also extensively investigated as an electrode material for supercapacitors. Chhowalla's group exfoliated bulk MoS2 powders into monolayer nanosheets,129 which could efficiently intercalate ions and achieved capacitance values ranging from ∼400 to ∼700 F cm−3 in a variety of aqueous electrolytes. Tour and co-workers prepared MoS2 nanoporous films as flexible electrodes for supercapacitors,130 the highly exposed edge sites and the large surface area are beneficial for both the surface and double-layer charge storage, rendering high pseudocapacitance. Based on the above successful studies, Tang et al. also synthesized MoS2 monolayer/polypyrrole ultrathin film nanocomposites,131 and Firmiano et al. deposited layered MoS2 on graphene nanosheets,132 as the Mo–C covalent chemical bond was formed, the electrode materials could maintain the integrity upon prolonged charge/discharge, thus improving the cycling performance. Besides MoS2, layered VS2 has also been tried; Xie's group exfoliated VS2 flakes into ultrathin nanosheets, making VS2 possess the behaviors of both metal and graphene.133 This led to high conductivity and large surface area of VS2, rendering fascinating electrochemical performance. Then Ji et al. investigated the charge-storage mechanism of VS2 as the SC electrode material by DFT calculations,134 revealing that the redox potential of the VS2 monolayer located at 0.25 V from the redox reaction of V4+/V3+.
4. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key process in promising fuel cells and rechargeable metal–air batteries.135 Nevertheless, the intrinsic slow kinetics and poor reversibility of oxygen reduction hinder their practical performance.11 Accordingly, searching for highly active and low cost ORR catalysts plays a pivotal role in overcoming these drawbacks. Recently, numerous materials have been identified as potent ORR catalysts, including noble Pt-alloys,136 nanocrystalline spinels,137 perovskites oxide,138 and carbonaceous materials.139 Impressively, metal sulfides highlight their comprehensive applications in the field of oxygen reduction catalysis due to high abundance, low cost, and comparable catalytic activity. Among them, cobalt sulfides are widely recognized as prospective ORR catalysts, but the relatively low conductivity and structural instability restrict their further applications. To handle these issues, Zhao et al. presented a one-step hydrothermal method to prepare size-controlled CoS2 nanoparticles. When tested as the cathodic catalyst for alkaline fuel cells, the CoS2 nanoparticles with an average size of 30.7 nm exhibited the best ORR catalytic activity with an open circuit potential of 0.94 V, the half-wave potential of 0.71 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and complete methanol tolerance in 0.1 M KOH.140 Distinguished from the above modified strategy, Dai and colleagues developed the Co1−xS/rGO hybrid materials via solution-phase reaction and annealing, of which the Co1−xS nanoparticles with a size of 10–20 nm were selectively anchored on rGO sheets (Fig. 8a and b). The incorporation of rGO sheets provided a conductive support for Co1−xS nanoparticles, and contemporaneously controlled their particle size. Deriving from the above advantages, this hybrid displayed fruitful improvement for the ORR with an onset potential at about 0.8 V (vs. RHE) in 0.5 M H2SO4.141 Then, Hou and co-workers synthesized Co3S4 nanotubes grown on graphene sheets as ORR catalysts. Featuring the porous structure of Co3S4, the fine conductivity of the graphene matrix, and the favourable transport of ions and electrons, this Co3S4/G composite was deemed to be a viable ORR electrocatalyst with the onset potential at around −0.05 V and a large electron transfer number (∼3.9) at −1.1 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 0.1 M KOH.142 In addition, Yu's group reported the preparation of hierarchical hollow Co9S8 microspheres by a facile solvothermal route, and further elucidated that hollow Co9S8 microspheres with a diameter of about 10–12 μm showed fascinating ORR catalytic activity with an onset potential at 0.88 V (vs. RHE) in 0.5 M H2SO4.143 However, compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst, the performance of cobalt sulfides is still limited. Herein, to further enhance their electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction, constructing bimetallic systems was regarded as an effective method. For example, Gu and co-workers excogitated urchin-like NiCo2S4 sub-micron spheres with an average diameter of 0.25 μm via a one-pot solution-based method (Fig. 8c). Efficient ORR activity with the onset potential at −0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution was achieved due to urchin-like microstructure and the distinctive d-electronic configuration of Co(III) ions.144 Moreover, Shen et al. developed a facile soft-template mediated method to fabricate the Co0.5Fe0.5S nanoparticles covalently embedded in a nitrogen-doped mesoporous graphitic carbon framework (Co0.5Fe0.5S@N-MC). When evaluated as a catalyst for the ORR, this core–shell material delivered improved catalytic activity and stability with an onset potential at 0.913 V, a half-wave potential at 0.808 V (vs. RHE), and a high diffusion-limiting current density in 0.1 M KOH.145

Concurrent with the advances in cobalt sulfides, some other metal sulfides have also been attempted. For instance, Surendranath and colleagues prepared the heazlewoodite phase of Ni3S2 thin films on gold electrodes by electrodeposition. Resulting from integrating the labile active sites with an anti-corrosion sulfide lattice, the film exhibited conspicuous catalytic activity with the onset potential at 0.8 V (vs. RHE) and nearly 90% faradaic efficiency for four-electron reduction of O2 in neutral phosphate buffer, better than that of polycrystalline platinum.146 More recently, to understand the effects of structure on catalytic performance, Zhang and co-workers demonstrated a one-step hydrothermal approach to prepare flower-like and rod-like NiS. Owing to the enhanced ORR performance, they evaluated them as cathode catalysts for non-aqueous Li–air batteries. Notably, the activity and stability of flower-like NiS exceeded those of rod-like NiS and pure Super P with the capacity of 6733 mA h g−1, the charge voltage of 4.24 V at the current density of 75 mA g−1.147
Following the success of MoS2 in the area of the energy storage devices, it was also tried as ORR catalysts. Li's group synthesized MoS2 nanoparticles with different sizes through facile ultrasonication and gradient centrifugation processes. Among them, the particles with a size of 2 nm exhibited remarkable activity and stability with a large limiting current density of 3.91 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Its superior ORR activity can be ascribed to the abundant exposed Mo edges which were beneficial for four-electron reduction of O2 to water.148 Furthermore, considering the improved ORR performance of MoS2 catalysts, Zhang et al. fabricated the Au nanoparticles grown on MoS2 nanosheets as the cathode material for rechargeable Li–O2 batteries (Fig. 8d). Benefiting from the 2D pore architecture and large specific surface area, the battery with the MoS2/AuNP nanohybrid displayed high performance with a low discharge overpotential of 0.21 V, a high specific discharge capacity of about 3567 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1 (Fig. 8e), and good cyclability over 50 cycles.149 In addition to the above mentioned metal sulfides, iron sulfides150 and copper sulfides151 also gained recognition as potential ORR catalysts even though they don't attract broad attention, whereas low cost makes them promising candidates as well. The results of these MS-based catalysts for the ORR are summarized in Table 1.

5. Hydrogen-related applications
5.1 Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
With the urgent demand for renewable energy, hydrogen fuel has emerged as a competitive candidate due to its environmental friendliness, green sustainability, and high energy density. Many methods have been applied to yield hydrogen fuel; among them, water electrolysis is considered as a fairly promising method. However, the conventional noble metal Pt electrocatalyst for hydrogen production could not be utilized on a massive scale because of scarcity and prohibitive cost. Consequently, it is of great importance to explore cost-effective, efficient HER catalysts. During the few past years, a series of metal sulfides have sprung up as a representative paradigm, such as MoSx (x ≥ 2),152,153 WS2,154and MSx (M = Fe, Co, Ni; x ≥ 1),155 the details will be listed below.

5.1.1 MoSx (x ≥ 2) and WS2. 
In recent years, a vast body of research has revealed that MoSx (x ≥ 2) are effective HER catalysts owing to their intriguing properties. Among them, the most well-known example is MoS2. The HER activity of MoS2 was investigated as early as the 1970s,156 whereas the advance was tardy due to the existence of large internal resistance among bulk MoS2 crystals, which showed inferior overall catalytic activity. In recent years, to improve the performance of MoS2 for HER, three approaches have been attempted.
One possible approach is structural engineering, which means to manipulate the MoS2 structure at nanoscale, including nanoparticles,157 nanowires,158 nanostructured films,159 and nanosheets.160 Theory161 and experiment162 have manifested that the catalytic activity for HER hinged on the number of active sites along the MoS2 edge. More specifically, the under-coordinated S atoms at the Mo-edge can adsorb H with a small free energy, whereas the basal plane is inert.163 Spontaneously, research efforts have been devoted to proliferating the exposed S–Mo–S active edge sites. For example, Jaramillo and colleagues synthesized double-gyroid MoS2 thin films through electrodeposition, followed by sulfuration and template removal (Fig. 9a). These mesoporous MoS2 thin films not only sufficiently exposed the catalytically active edge sites, but also efficiently facilitated the transport of reactants and products, thus delivering excellent HER catalytic activity with the current density of 10 mA cm−2 at about 260 mV overpotential (with iR-correction) and a Tafel slope of approximately 50 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte.164 Besides, Cui and co-workers presented a rapid synthesis process to grow MoS2 thin films, of which the films were vertically aligned over the substrate, thereby maximally exposing the edges on the film surface. Such an edge-terminated film exhibited high activity and stability for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution.165

Another efficient strategy is to enhance the intrinsic activity, ranging from introducing structural defects and disorder,166,167 reinforcing the activity of S edge sites168 to activate the inert basal plane.169 For instance, Xie's group reported a facile method to synthesize oxygen-incorporated MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets. Benefiting from a controllable disorder structure and oxygen incorporation in MoS2 catalysts, this hybrid material showed dramatically enhanced HER activity with the onset overpotential at 120 mV and a small Tafel slope of 55 mV dec−1, as well as an excellent durability of 20000 s in 0.5 M H2SO4.170 Similar to hydrodesulfurization reaction, doping transition metal into the inert S-edges has also demonstrated to enhance the catalytic activity for HER. Cui's group combined the DFT calculation with experiments to incorporate transition metal (Co, Fe, Ni, Cu) into the edge sites of the vertically aligned MoS2 nanofilms, demonstrating significantly improved HER activity.171 From another perspective, activating the MoS2 basal plane could further enhance the HER activity but this strategy possesses considerable difficulties. More recently, a pioneering design was tried by Zheng's group, who firstly proposed an effective method to activate the monolayer 2H-MoS2 basal plane by introducing strained sulphur (S) vacancies (Fig. 9b). Typically, the S-vacancies acted as new highly active and tunable catalytic sites for HER, displaying unprecedentedly high intrinsic activity with a turnover frequency (TOFS-vacancy) of 0.31 s−1 at 0 V (vs. RHE) and a Tafel slope of 60 mV dec−1.172
The third way is improving the conductivity, including chemical exfoliation173 and coupling with appropriate substrates.174 Chemical exfoliation is an efficient method to lower charge transfer loss and reduce the stack between MoS2 layers. For instance, Jin's group prepared metallic 1T-MoS2 nanosheets on graphite through chemical exfoliation of a semiconducting 2H-MoS2 nanostructure. Due to their abundant active sites and favorable electron kinetics, excellent electrocatalytic HER performance was achieved with a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 187 mV overpotential and a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec−1.175 In comparison, Chhowalla and colleagues presented solvent-free chemical exfoliation followed by eliminating surface charges, to construct highly conductive 1T-MoS2 nanosheets as HER catalysts. This optimized structure showed remarkable catalytic activity with a low Tafel slope of 40 mV dec−1, indicating that the electrochemical desorption of H2 was the rate-controlling step. More importantly, they found the active sites of 1T-MoS2 mainly located in the basal plane rather than only at the edge.176 In addition to chemical exfoliation, integrating the electrocatalysts with an appropriate support is also essential for overcoming poor conductivity of MoS2 and further enhancing its catalytic activity for HER.177 In 2011, Dai's group firstly prepared reduced graphene oxides decorated with MoS2 nanoparticles via a feasible solvothermal method (Fig. 9c). The MoS2/rGO hybrid materials provided abundant active edge sites and an excellent graphene network, resulting in high electrocatalytic activity for HER with a low overpotential of 0.1 V (Fig. 9d), and a small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec−1.178 Their work sheds light on the synthesis of an advanced MoS2 electrocatalyst with a highly conductive substrate. Since then, many conductive templates such as carbon nanofiber foam,179 nanoporous metals,180 and graphene additives have become popular.181
Aside from MoS2, other molybdenum sulfides-based materials were also researched in recent years. Hu's group described a feasible solution-based chemical approach to synthesize amorphous MoS3 particles as efficient HER catalysts,153 and further fabricated amorphous ternary M–MoS3 films (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) by electrodeposition. When tested as HER catalysts, these amorphous films exhibited higher activity than crystalline nanoparticles.163 In comparison, David Lou's group developed an M–MoS3 (M = Co, Ni) hollow prism via fast template-engaged precipitation and annealing processes. Owing to their desirable structural advantages, the resultant Co–MoS3 catalysts showed enhanced HER performance with large cathodic current density, a small Tafel slope, and good stability in acidic solution.182
Drawing on high HER catalytic activity of MoS2, WS2 with the analogous layered structure was also successfully investigated. Notably, Sobczynski et al. have reported that tungsten disulfide could be employed as a novel catalyst for water decomposition in 1988.183 However, until a myriad of MoS2 catalysts emerging for HER, recent years have seen a resurgence of WS2 catalysts. In particular, DFT studies announced that W and S edges of WS2 had equal catalytic activity for HER due to equal free energies of binding hydrogen.184 As aforementioned, chemical exfoliation is an efficient method to tailor nanostructures, increase active sites, and reinforce the conductivity. Therefore, Chhowalla and colleagues fabricated the exfoliated WS2 nanosheets via a facile pre-lithiation method. Due to the high concentration of metallic 1T (octahedral) phase and the zigzag-like local lattice distortions, this distinctive nanostructure delivered enhanced HER activity with the exchange current density of 2 × 10−5 A cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 60 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte.185 Similarly, Jin and co-workers presented a fast microwave-assisted chemical exfoliation method to prepare 1T-WS2 nanosheets. When tested as HER catalysts, the 1T-WS2 showed superior catalytic activity owing to great kinetics, metallic conductivity, and abundant active sites.186 Trying from another perspective, Barber's group firstly reported the preparation of ternary CoWSx and NiWSx thin films with WS2-like layered structures by facile electrodeposition. Among them, doping Co promoted the activity of S-edge sites, simultaneously expanded the effective electrochemical surface area, thereby rendering robust catalytic performance for HER in water over a wide pH range.187 Distinguished from the above mentioned methods, Shin and co-workers prepared WS2/rGO hybrid nanosheets through one-pot hydrothermal reaction followed by heat treatment at 300 °C (Fig. 9e). The hybrid materials benefited from the interconnected conducting rGO network and the promotion of WS2 crystallinity after annealing, delivering superior catalytic activity for HER with the Tafel slope of 58 mV dec−1 (Fig. 9f).188


5.1.2 Fe, Co, Ni sulfides. 
The metal sulfides (MSx, M = Fe, Co, Ni; x ≥ 1) exploited from minerals have also attracted worldwide attention as promising HER catalysts owing to their abundance. Inspired by the metal–sulfur clusters (active sites) in [NiFe] and [FeFe] hydrogenases, researchers have been designing HER catalysts based on iron and nickel sulfides.189 Jasion et al. prepared 2D FeS2 disc nanostructures by a solution hot-injection approach, and the hyperthin FeS2 exhibited high electrocatalytic activity as well as remarkable durability for HER.190 Moreover, Dai and co-workers fabricated Co-doped FeS2 nanosheets hybridized with carbon nanotubes via a facile solvothermal process (Fig. 10a). This Fe0.9Co0.1S2/CNT composite showed high HER activity with low overpotential (0.12 V at 20 mA cm−2), a small Tafel slope (46 mV dec−1), and high stability (40 h) in acidic solutions.191 In another study, Jiang et al. synthesized amorphous Ni–S films on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) with a major composition of Ni3S2 by scalable potentiodynamic deposition followed by annealing. When evaluated as an HER catalyst, high catalytic activity and long-term stability in neutral water were obtained.192 Apart from Fe, Ni sulfides, Co sulfides have also been identified as efficient HER catalysts because recent studies have shown that the Co atom possesses low free energy for H adsorption.193,194 Guided by this, Sun et al. reported the preparation of the Co–S film on FTO by potentiodynamic deposition (Fig. 10b), which showed effective HER activity with a low onset overpotential of 43 mV, a Tafel slope of 93 mV dec−1 in pH 7 phosphate buffer, and a longstanding durability of 40 h in neutral pH water.195 Successively, the origin of its high performance for HER was elucidated using Raman spectroscopy combined with X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) by Yang's group.196 Furthermore, Ramakrishna and colleagues fabricated a 3D free-standing CoS2/rGO–CNT nanocomposite as a binder-free electrode for the HER via a hydrothermal method followed by vacuum filtration (Fig. 10c). Stemming from the synergistic effect of a large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, and a 3D nanoporous structure, this hybrid exhibited high activity and stability with a small Tafel slope of about 51 mV dec−1, low charge-transfer resistance, and negligible loss of the cathodic current after 500 cycles.197 Distinguished from the above strategies, Markovic's group developed a compact and robust CoMoSx chalcogel structure (Fig. 10d), by integrating the high activity of CoSx with the high stability of MoSx; this CoMoSx catalyst was considered as a promising candidate for efficient hydrogen evolution in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes.198 Huang et al. also prepared a series of hollow Co-based bimetallic sulfide polyhedra (MxCo3−xS4, M = Zn, Ni, and Cu) through a scalable metal–organic framework self-templated process. Among them, hollow Zn0.30Co2.70S4 (Fig. 10e) displayed significantly improved HER activity and durability over a wide pH range due to the rational design of structure and homogeneous doping, but the origins behind their catalytic activity are still elusive.199 More recently, Wang and colleagues reported the pyrite-structured cobalt phosphosulfide (CoS|P) nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanotubes as efficient HER catalysts. Highlight was that the substitution of some S atoms by P atoms (Fig. 10f) could enhance the material stability and catalytic durability, rendering no obvious degradation of the activity over 2000 cycles.200

In general, it can be summarized that such metal sulfides (MSx, M = Mo, W, Fe, Co, Ni; x ≥ 1) enriched and expanded the family of non-noble metal catalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution (Table 2), owning to their abundance, low cost, and fascinating electrocatalytic activity. Further studies on rational structure design and composition optimization will accelerate the application of these counterparts for efficient hydrogen production.

5.2 Hydrogen storage
Hydrogen is considered as an ideal energy carrier for household and traffic uses since it undergoes a fully clean combustion reaction with oxygen to generate energy and water.13,201 In order to achieve a “hydrogen economy” world, one of the key issues is excogitating, safe, low-cost, and effective hydrogen storage systems instead of traditional high-pressure and cryogenic hydrogen storage.202 Currently, tremendous efforts have been made to improve the gravimetric hydrogen density and operational safety of hydrogen carriers such as metal hydrides (alanates, amides, and borohydrides), activated charcoal, and advanced carbons.203 Surprisingly, it is found that metal sulfides can be directly or indirectly used for hydrogen storage. For example, Chen et al. reported the synthesis of MoS2 nanotubes by directly heating (NH4)2MoS2 in hydrogen and their electrochemical hydrogen storage behavior.204 Results elucidated that alkaline-treated MoS2 nanotubes exhibited enhanced hydrogen adsorption/desorption performance owing to the high specific surface area and nanoporous structure. Motivated by the above report, Xie's group fabricated MoS2 hierarchical hollow cubic cages assembled by bilayers through a one-step surfactant free self-assembly process.205 When employed for electrochemical hydrogen storage, the as-prepared MoS2 cubic cages showed a high electrochemical capacity of 375 mA h g−1 due to the more active edges exposing on the upright-standing nanoplates. The salts of [BH4]−, especially lithium borohydride (LiBH4), is considered as a promising host material for hydrogen storage owing to its high theoretical storage capacity (18.5 wt%, 21 kg m−3). Nevertheless, its high thermodynamic stability, slow dehydrogenation/hydrogenation kinetics, and poor reversibility limit the practical application.203 Concerning these problems, our group synthesized 3D hierarchical flower-like MoS2 spheres by a facile hydrothermal method,206 and then ball-milled with LiBH4 for catalyzing. Benefiting from the high active site density and the enlarged interlayer distance of MoS2 nanosheets, the LiBH4–MoS2 mixture exhibited enhanced dehydrogenation properties in both lowering the hydrogen release temperature and accelerating the hydrogen release kinetics. Besides MoS2, some other metal sulfides are also of great interest for hydrogen storage. Chen et al. obtained high-purity multiwalled TiS2 nanotubes with open-ended tips by a chemical transport reaction, which can efficiently store 2.5 wt% hydrogen at the temperature of 25 °C and under the hydrogen pressure of 4 MPa.207 Then, 3D Fe3S4 flower-like microspheres,208 Co–S alloys,209 and porous sponge-like Ni3S2 nanostructures210 were prepared as potential candidates for hydrogen storage and this further broadens our horizon towards versatile applications of metal sulfides.
6. Conclusions and perspectives
In this review, we have summarized the recent progress in the field of rational design and efficient synthesis of metal sulfides with diverse architectures, and highlighted their promising applications in energy storage/conversion systems, including LIBs, SIBs, MIBs, SCs, oxygen reduction reaction, and hydrogen utilization. Generally speaking, the performance of energy-related devices largely depends on the morphology, size, structure, and composition of the active materials. Though various metal sulfides with tailored micro/nano-structures have shown improved electrochemical properties, most of them can still not meet the commercial standard, because each design strategy applied alone commonly results in limited enhancement. Therefore, it is more compelling to integrate multiple interesting design strategies, thus maximizing their electrochemical advantages to meet the present energy demands. The metal sulfide-based electrodes or catalysts simultaneously concerning the cost, performance, safety, environmental compatibility, and ease of preparation are still urgently needed.
To date, the majority of the reports regarding the applications of MSs as advanced electrodes or electrocatalysts with promising enhancement are mainly based on only experimental observations. The industrial-scale production and manipulation of functional MSs with high electrochemical activity still face difficulties. A comprehensive and in-depth insight into the correlation between the structure/composition and the property/performance of these MSs has not yet been systematically achieved. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop efficient and reliable evaluation criteria for the MS-based energy-related devices. The establishment of mathematical modeling and theoretical simulation is also highly anticipated to direct the purposeful design and facile, large-scale, and low-cost fabrication of MSs with superior electrochemical performance.
Understanding the failure mechanisms upon cycling in these MSs-based electrodes for LIBs, SIBs, MIBs, and SCs is crucial to guide the design of advanced materials. This requires not only understanding the material conversion, structure evolution, and composition regulation, but also taking into account the electrolyte compatibility and surface/interface issues. It has been demonstrated that modification of the electrolytes, such as adding FEC additives and using ether-based electrolyte, could significantly improve the overall electrochemical performance of metal sulfides. Therefore, we also expect that the proper adjustment of electrolytes for both rechargeable batteries and SCs could further optimize the electrochemical behavior of MSs. In addition, it cannot be ignored that the discharge/charge voltage plateaus of these MSs-based anode materials in secondary batteries are generally high. This would lower the operating voltage and energy density of full batteries. Elaborate design concurrently balancing the capacity, durability, energy density, safety, and cost is necessary to make the MS-based electrodes practically available.
The oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction with MS catalysts are complex processes, which could involve different mechanisms determined by the nature of metal sulfides, including their physicochemical properties, structures and compositions. So far, there have not been many such studies that are particularly focused on the kinetics and mechanisms of electrochemical oxygen reduction/hydrogen evolution with metal sulfides. By understanding the intrinsic principles behind the performance, future development might lead to highly efficient and economical MSs-based catalysts after some optimization among electrocatalytic activity, thermodynamic stability, corrosion resistance, fabrication cost, and durability. This would provide a major boost for the relevant energy technologies towards their aspired commercialization.
Despite the challenges ahead, there is hope that metal sulfides will be the materials platform in the near future for breaking many of the current bottlenecks of clean and renewable energy-related technologies. To achieve this goal, significant advances need to be made on the electrochemical performance and in-depth insight into the mechanisms. With sustained and dedicated research efforts, these intriguing MSs would offer a new avenue to make the attractive energy devices commercially viable. More importantly, we believe that the experience achieved in metal sulfides is of great guiding significance in promoting the progress of other interstitial compounds (e.g. metal oxides/carbides/nitrides) for high-performance energy storage and conversion.
