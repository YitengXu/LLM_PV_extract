    , Accepted 1st December 2020First published on 8th December 2020AbstractMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively used in the fabrication of new advanced electrode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, low-productivity and high-cost are some of the main challenges of MOF-derived electrodes. Herein, we report a simple solvothermal procedure to fabricate novel Fe4-based metal–organic clusters (Fe-MOCs) with their subsequent conversion to an S,N dual-doped carbon framework incorporating iron oxides under a N2 atmosphere (namely Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC). The as-prepared Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC composite, owing to the strong interaction between the dual-doped carbon and iron oxides, shows excellent lithium storage performance as an anode with high pseudocapacitance. Furthermore, DFT computational analyses confirm that the hybrid shows excellent adsorption ability with a low energy barrier due to strong electronic interactions between the iron oxides and S,N-doped carbon matrix. In addition, Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC-based LIB shows high energy and power densities at the full-cell level, confirming this synthesis strategy to be a promising approach towards MOC-derived electrode materials for their application in LIBs and beyond-lithium batteries.
Introduction
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) composed of bridging linkers and metal nodes have been demonstrated to be promising precursors or templates to fabricate porous electrodes and hybrids in energy storage and conversion areas such as batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells and solar cells.1–4 Nevertheless, the associated synthesis usually includes high-cost and time-consuming procedures. Apart from MOFs, metal–organic clusters (MOCs) are other low-cost and high-yield organic–inorganic precursors inherently assembled by more than one metal ion bridged via organic moieties and inorganic anions. However, MOC-derived electrodes are at their infant stage and Fe-based electrodes are yet to be studied.5,6 Moreover, the potential application of MOC-derived anodes has not been evaluated in full-cells, which urgently requires the design of novel MOC-derived electrodes for high-performance full-cell LIBs.
Among the commonly reported transition-metal oxides (TMOs), iron oxides have been widely investigated as electrode materials owing to their high theoretical capacity, eco-friendliness and natural abundance.7,8 However, their huge volume expansion and low electronic conductivity lead to fast capacity fading and inferior cycling stability.9,10 These problems can be solved by the following strategies. On the one hand, the storage properties of TMOs embedded in carbon are usually improved via a heteroatom doping strategy, which provides enhanced conductivity.11 More importantly, to further improve the electrochemical property, effective strategies of doping carbon with two heteroatoms need to be developed imminently because lithium storage is affected not only by the doping content of heteroatoms but also by synergistic effects between dopants.12 However, combining the benefits of heteroatom doping of carbon from the MOCs, the fabrication of novel Fe-based electrode materials remains challenging in the field.
In this work, we synthesized novel Fe4-based metal–organic clusters (Fe-MOCs) for the first time and used them as precursors to fabricate an Fe2O3@Fe3O4 hybrid encapsulated in a S,N-dual doped carbon network (Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC). Although MOFs have emerged as ideal platforms for the synthesis of single-atom catalysts (SACs) by pyrolysis,13 most strategies are limited to MOFs with N-containing ligands (such as ZIFs) and the introduction of other metal atoms as homogeneous dopants, which are rationally and spatially separated in an atomically dispersed form.14,15 However, Fe elements in our case tend to fuse together to form nanoparticles instead, mainly due to the tetranuclear metal cluster Fe4(μ3-O)2 in MOCs and the abundant oxygen sources resulted from SO42− anions and DMF molecules, leading to the formation of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC as the final product. As an anode, the as-prepared Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC delivered an excellent specific energy capacity of 934 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and 511 mA h g−1 at 3.0 A g−1 in half cells, a maximum energy density of 216 W h kg−1 and a power density of 3000 W kg−1 in the full cell configuration. Kinetic analysis shows that extra storage active sites and better ionic/electronic conductivity facilitate the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC anode to achieve impressive rate performance and high reversible capacity via the pseudocapacitance-dominated Li+ storage mechanism. Theoretical calculations confirm that the excellent performance of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC is attributed to the lowest energy barrier required to complete electrochemical reactions and strong electronic interactions between Fe2O3@Fe3O4 and SNC. In situ Raman characterization reveals the adsorption mechanism for lithium storage of SNC. The present work not only provides a novel avenue for the design and fabrication of Fe-MOC-derived hybrids, but also deciphers the storage mechanism of MOC-derived hybrids as anode materials for LIBs.
Results and discussion
The synthesis of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC materials is a two-step strategy, namely a solvothermal process followed by thermal decomposition as shown in Fig. 1a. For the first step, ferric sulfate was dispersed in N,N-dimethylformamide solution to prepare the Fe-MOCs precursor. The synthesis of Fe-MOCs is mainly based on the following considerations: in order to avoid the loss of non-metallic elements (N, S and C), we require that the precursor be calcined in an inert atmosphere, and the calcination temperature should not be too high. Finally, the well-designed Fe-MOCs were successfully synthesized and formulated as [Fe4(μ3-O)2(SO4)6(DMF)4]·4[(CH3)2NH2] by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, which was further confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1–S3†). As shown in Fig. S3,† the obvious platform between 400 and 500 °C can be ascribed to the formation of FeSO4 (JCPDF no. 17-0873), which was further confirmed by PXRD analysis (Fig. S4†). It is worth mentioning that there is a big weight loss after 500 °C, which corresponds to the decomposition of FeSO4 to the corresponding iron oxide. The single crystal structural study shows that Fe-MOC is a cluster, which crystallizes in the monoclinic P21/c space group. In Fe-MOCs, four Fe3+ cations, two oxo anions, six sulfate anions, four dimethylformamide molecules and four free [(CH3)2NH2]+ cations (from the decomposition of dimethylformamide, Fig. S5†) are found. All Fe atoms exhibit six-coordinated [FeO6] octahedral geometry. The Fe(1) atom is surrounded by one oxygen atom from an oxo anion, two oxygen atoms from two DMF molecules and three oxygen atoms from three sulfate anions. The Fe(2) atom is defined by two oxygen atoms from two oxo anions and four oxygen atoms from four sulfate anions. The Fe–O bond length ranges from 1.875(4) to 2.102(4) Å, which is consistent with those reported for Fe-based coordination polymers.16–18

The second step results in the preparation of a porous Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC hybrid under a N2 atmosphere at 500 °C. As illustrated in Fig. 1b, XRD analysis shows that the diffraction peaks for Fe2O3 (JCPDF no. 33-0664), Fe3O4 (JCPDF no. 65-3107) and carbon peak (JCPDF no. 50-0926) at around 23° indicate the successful synthesis of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC hybrid. The Raman spectrum (Fig. S6†) was also performed to verify the existence of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4 phase in the hybrid due to the obvious Raman peaks at 662 and 489 cm−1 attributed to Fe3O4,19 while two small peaks at 338 and 286 cm−1 are ascribed to Fe2O3.20 Additionally, the Raman spectra contains a G band (sp2-hybridized graphitic carbon) at ∼1581 cm−1 and a D band (sp3 defects originating from disordered carbon) at ∼1374 cm−1. A lower IG/ID value (∼1.02) is observed, demonstrating the low graphitization degree of the hybrids. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC sample shows the typical type-IV with a hysteresis loop, a total pore volume of 0.2679 cm3 g−1 and a specific surface area of 365.16 m2 g−1 (Fig. S7†), which will allow the nanoparticles sufficiently come into contact with the electrolyte and will prove beneficial for promoting necessary access to Li+.
To determine the chemical status and composition of the elements in Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted. The survey spectra verified the existence of Fe, O, N, C and S in Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC (Fig. S8a†). As presented in the high-resolution spectrum of Fe 2p (Fig. S8b†), the two characteristic peaks at 724 and 711 eV for Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 of the as-synthesized sample are consistent with the previous values of Fe3O4.21 In addition, the existence of a satellite peak located at 719 eV affirmed the existence of Fe2O3.9 The enlarged O 1s (Fig. S8c†) peak is decomposed into three species with a binding energy of 532.3 eV (chemi- and physi-adsorbed water), 531.2 eV (hydroxyl components) and 529.8 eV (metal–oxygen bonds).22 The high-resolution spectra of C 1s (Fig. S8d†) in Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC is deconvoluted into three peaks. Typically, the peak located at 284.6 eV is generally related to the C–C bond.23 The peak at 288.4 eV corresponds to O–CO, while the other peak at around 285.7 eV belongs to C–N and C–S, which further proves the successful incorporation of sulfur and nitrogen into the carbon framework.24 Besides, in the N 1s spectra of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC (Fig. S8e†), the peaks at 399.8 eV and 398.8 eV represent the pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen, and the peak at 401.3 eV belongs to graphitic nitrogen.25 The contents of graphitic-N, pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N are 33.9%, 38.4% and 27.7%, respectively (Table S3†). It is worth noting that functional groups and heteroatoms in carbon frameworks can markedly alter the donor/electron characteristics. In addition, as illustrated in Fig. S8f,† the S 2p spectra is divided into three representative peaks located at 161.7, 164.6 and 168.9 eV, which are ascribed to C–S–C, CS and C–SOx–C, respectively.26 The high sulfur and nitrogen doping content is important to improve the electronic conductivity of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC and to further enhance the lithium-storage property of the electrode.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals that the size of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4 nanoparticle is about 80 nm (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the SEM image in Fig. S9† and transmission emission microscopy (TEM) image of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC hybrid (Fig. 1d-inset) show that Fe2O3@Fe3O4 NPs are attached on the carbon framework. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the hybrid collected from the square-dotted area depicts a porous carbon structure (Fig. 1d). Analysis of the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image (Fig. 1e) confirms that the composite mainly consists of different lattice planes of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4. According to the HRTEM image in Fig. 1f, there exists a phase boundary between Fe2O3 and Fe3O4. Between the interfaces of two iron compounds, the lattice mismatch (denoted m) can be calculated using eqn (1): (1)
For example, the lattice fringes of 0.296 nm corresponding to the (220) lattice plane of Fe3O4 and 0.251 nm corresponding to the (110) lattice plane of Fe2O3 are found with angular and lattice mismatches of 55° and 3.4%, respectively. In addition, the lattice fringes of the Fe3O4 (311) lattice plane and the Fe2O3 (024) lattice plane with a 46° angle are also observed, with m of 2.7% (Fig. 1g). These results indicate that our as-prepared Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC consists of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 phase boundaries, and such boundaries create lattice disorder and distortions, which may create more defects for conductivity enhancement and more active sites for Li+ storage.27,28
A tomography technique based on high-angle annular dark-field STEM (HAADF-STEM) was further employed to visualize the three-dimensional architecture of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC composite. HAADF-STEM images were recorded at angles ranging from 30° to 60° with a 0.5° increment (see Movie S1†). A simultaneously iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) reconstruction algorithm with 100 iterations was adopted to reconstruct the object. Then, the FEI Avizo software was used to visualize the 3D structure (see Movie S2†). As shown in Fig. 1h and i, iron oxide nanoparticles (red colour) were easily identified and encapsulated in the carbon matrix (cyan colour). Moreover, the corresponding elemental mapping analysis (Fig. 1j–o) showed the coexistence of Fe, O, C, N and S elements in the hybrid, which is in agreement with XPS results. All the aforementioned characterization results demonstrate the successful preparation of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC hybrid with a pore structure, which could be beneficial for improving its lithium storage performance.29,30
The electrochemical properties of as-prepared Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC were assessed using a coin-type half-cell. Commercially available Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and Fe2O3@Fe3O4 electrodes were also employed for comparisons. Based on the 1st–4th cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 2a), apart from the regular redox peaks of iron oxides,31 the wide anodic peak (D) range from 1.37 to 1.95 V can be ascribed to the oxidation of Fe0 to Fe2+ and another weak anodic peak (E) centered at 2.35 V can be ascribed to the reversible oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+.32 These peaks are absent for the other three iron oxides (Fig. S10†). In subsequent cycles, the reduction peaks shift to ∼0.84 V, implying a more facile reduction of Fe3+ owing to the activation process related to structural re-establishment.33 Besides, the peak intensity is almost the same, also indicating the excellent reversibility of Li+ extraction and insertion processes.34 Conversely, the peak intensity for commercial Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and Fe2O3@Fe3O4 decreased (Fig. S10†), suggesting that large lithium storage capacity loss takes place in the electrochemical reaction. The charge/discharge curves at 200 mA g−1 in Fig. 2b show initial charge and discharge specific capacities of 1093 and 1734 mA h g−1, respectively. The capacity decay of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC electrodes in the initial cycles was attributed to the formation of an unstable SEI layer.35 Lithium ion intercalation into the SEI film may fracture, exfoliate and reform the SEI during the initial capacity decaying period. In this case, the irreversible reaction consuming active lithium occurs continuously and further results in the lithium storage performance degradation of active materials. However, in subsequent cycles, a stable SEI layer can be formed without fracture due to the so-called reactivation process.36,37 Our attempt towards designing the novel Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC electrode is to enhance the electrical conductivity of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4 hybrid. Thus, we evaluated the rate capability of the as-synthesized Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC (Fig. 2c). The capacity of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC is 511 mA h g−1 at a high current density of 3 A g−1, which was also recovered to a reversible capacity of about 1095 mA h g−1 after 80 cycles. These storage capacities are also significantly higher than those of pristine Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and Fe2O3@Fe3O4 at all corresponding current densities. Nyquist plots of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC have much smaller diameters of the semicircles in the medium–high frequency area and more vertical straight line in the low frequency area compared to other electrodes (Fig. 2d). The results indicate that Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC exhibits a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) and rapid Li+ diffusion, implying faster charge transfer efficiency and excellent kinetics.38 This also suggests that the incorporation of Fe2O3@Fe3O4 nanoparticles into S,N dual-doped porous carbon frameworks can significantly enhance electrical conductivity owing to the synergistic contribution from individual heteroatoms in the overall hybrid electrode. For example, XPS analyses show that the N element is present in the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC electrode in the forms of pyrrolic-N, pyridinic-N and graphitic-N (Fig. S8e†), which are beneficial for generating abundant active sites and external defects, improving the electronic conductivity of the electrode.39 Likewise, the existence of sulfur atoms as confirmed in Fig. S8f† can make the carbon based material electron-rich.40

Fig. 3a presents the cycling behaviour of commercial Fe2O3, Fe3O4, Fe2O3@Fe3O4 and Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC at 200 mA g−1, and the corresponding coulombic efficiency of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC is also shown. The capacity of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC shows a decrease during the initial 30 cycles, followed by a rapid increase in the subsequent cycles. This is a common phenomenon for most iron oxide-based electrodes.41 A capacity of 934 mA h g−1 is gained until 230 cycles at 200 mA g−1. Such a high capacity not only shows superiority to the commercially available Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and Fe2O3@Fe3O4 but also shows outstanding performance compared to previously reported iron oxides and their composite materials (Table S4†). It should be pointed out that the specific capacity improvement with increasing electrochemical cycles can be ascribed to the activation of more electrochemical reactive sites of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC taking part in Li+ storage.5 After the 230th cycle stability test, the Rct value of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC electrode was apparently smaller than the initial cycle confirming the enhanced kinetics (Fig. S11†). XRD, XPS and morphological analyses reveal no phase, composition and structural changes in Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC after the stability test as shown in Fig. S12–S14,† respectively, confirming remarkable structural stability. Experimentally, we attributed the excellent lithium storage performance of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC to the high surface area as well as the synergistic effects between Fe2O3@Fe3O4 nanoparticles and SNC frameworks. This provides enough space to alleviate the volume change, short electron/ion diffusion distances, fast electron transfer efficiency and stability enhancement by highly conductive SNC frameworks. Moreover, the long-term cycling performance of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC at a high current density was performed. As shown in Fig. S15,† the capacity remains 516 mA h g−1 at 3 A g−1 after 500 cycles (with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency), demonstrating the superior long-term durability for practical use. In particular, as shown in Fig. S16,† the phase boundaries between Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 can still be observed after cycling, indicating the stable cycling property.

To further investigate the effect of temperature on the nanostructure of the as-prepared hybrids, the Fe-MOC precursors were also annealed at different temperatures (600–800 °C) for 2 h under a N2 atmosphere. From the XRD patterns in Fig. S17,† the diffraction peaks for Fe2O3 (JCPDF no. 33-0664), Fe3O4 (JCPDF no. 65-3107) and carbon (JCPDF no. 50-0926) are observed in all three high-temperature samples. The refinement function of MDI JADE 6.5 software was employed to calculate the ratio of components based on the reference intensity ratio (RIR) values of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4. As shown in Table S5,† when the temperature rises, the weight content of Fe2O3 gradually increases and the ratio of Fe3O4 decreases. As presented in Fig. S18,† the higher calcination temperature leads to the aggregation of particles and the size of the iron oxides increases to more than 500 nm (especially for 700 and 800 °C). Besides, the Rct value for Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC (500 °C) is lower than that for the products annealed at higher temperature (Fig. S19a†). The rate and cycling property of the hybrids annealed at 600, 700 and 800 °C are depicted in Fig. S19b and S19c,† which present low lithium storage capacity and inferior rate property, which further affirm the superior electrochemical performance of the as-synthesized Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC (500 °C). All the above results show that the optimum calcination temperature for Fe-MOCs precursors was 500 °C.
Commonly, high ionic or electronic conductivity for hybrids is regarded as the preconditions to activate pseudocapacitance, which normally demands designing particular morphologies and fabricating precise structures in a nanoscale dimension.42,43 Our Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC electrode design enables high Li+ diffusion and enhanced electrical conductivity, thus the activation process occurs upon long-term cycling resulting in extra Li+ storage capacity. This means that the enhanced kinetics of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC electrode leading to ever-growing Li+ storage capacity can be attributed to pseudocapacitance contribution. To gain further insight into the pseudocapacitance contribution, we investigated the capacitive and diffusive processes of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC electrode during cycling. Fig. S20a–c† presents the CV curves of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC hybrid at different sweep rates from 0.2 to 1.0 mV s−1 for the fresh cell, after 100 and 230 electrochemical cycles, respectively. The contribution of capacitive and diffusion-controlled behaviour is analyzed using i = avb, where a and b are constants, v is the sweep rate and i is the peak current. The value of b can be ascertained from the slope of logi vs. logv plots. When b = 0.5, it exhibits a dominant diffusion-limited behaviour, while when b is close to 1 it indicates a capacitive process. Fig. S21† illustrates that the b values of cathodic and anodic peaks are 0.74 and 0.79, respectively, which means that the electrode process is preponderantly influenced by capacitive behaviour, further contributing to the rapid electrode kinetics.44 The quantitative investigation between diffusion-limited behaviour and the capacitive process can be acquired by i = k1v + k2v1/2, where k2 and k1 are constants and i (current) at a specific voltage is a combination of diffusion-controlled effects (k2v1/2) and capacitive contributions (k1v). Thus, the percentage of the pseudocapacitive contributions at different sweep rates can be quantitatively distinguished, and the results are shown in Fig. 3b–d and Fig. S22.† The pseudocapacitive contributions of the fresh Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC electrode increase with increasing sweep rates. After 100 and 230 cycles, the pseudocapacitance also increases, respectively, clarifying the reason of excellent rate capability of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC anode. The high pseudocapacitive contribution is ascribed to the activation of more electrochemical reactive sites of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC, taking part in Li+ storage, and easier oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+. Hence, additional lithium storage capacity, stable cycle property and excellent rate performance were observed.
Apart from experimental electrochemical measurements, theoretical and in situ experimental analyses are highly suitable to address and discuss the reasons for performance enhancement in LIB electrodes. Owing to the fact that rate capability is intimately related to Li+ diffusion performances, we theoretically deciphered the mechanism of the diffusion of Li+ using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, aided to calculate the Li+ diffusion energy barrier required for complete Li+ diffusion processes. The optimized cluster structures of Fe2O3, Fe3O4, SNC and Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC are shown in Fig. S23† and enlarged images and detailed bonding of Fe, O and C of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC are shown in Fig. S24.† In addition, the cluster models of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-C, Fe2O3@Fe3O4-NC and Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SC were also employed for comparison as shown in Fig. S25 and S26† depicting the possible Li+ diffusion pathways for Fe2O3@Fe3O4-C, Fe2O3@Fe3O4-NC, Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SC and Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC, with the top views also depicted in Fig. 4a, b-inset and Fig. S27-inset.† The possible Li+ diffusion pathways were only shown for the carbon because the defects in a carbonaceous material immensely contribute to the transmission paths, hence decreasing the diffusion energy barrier.45,46 Thus, the corresponding energy barriers for Li+ diffusion of the four materials are shown in Fig. 4a, b and Fig. S27,† respectively. There is no doubt that pristine Fe2O3@Fe3O4-C has the largest lithium ion diffusion energy barrier (5.95 eV). However, compared with N, doping S with smaller electronegativity and large radius is advantageous to further create active sites of carbonaceous electrodes.47 Moreover, considering the synergistic effect of binary-heteroatom doping, to realize the materials with high ionic conductivity, S/N co-doping is a feasible strategy. Thus, compared with the diffusion energy barrier of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-NC (2.98 eV) and Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SC (2.57 eV), Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC possesses a lower energy barrier (0.66 eV) and undoubtedly clarifies the reason for the best and excellent discharge/charge rate performance of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC for LIBs. For a more profound understanding of the function of the dual-doped carbon matrix, we calculate charge density difference according to the following equation: Δρ = ρ(carbon/Fe2O3@Fe3O4) − ρ(carbon) − ρ(Fe2O3@Fe3O4). The charge density differences of the two samples are shown in Fig. 4c and S28,† which shows that the density differences on Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 for all the samples are nearly the same. However, compared to the density difference on the surface of undoped and single-doped materials, the dual-doped electrode (Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC) has much higher electron density and the latter achieves a higher electron density difference (Fig. 4c-right image). The result indicates that more electron transport occurred between Fe2O3@Fe3O4 and SNC, hinting the strongest electronic interaction between Fe2O3@Fe3O4 and SNC.

To gain further insight into the electronic interaction and mechanism of Li+ storage in Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC, in situ Raman analyses were performed. in situ Raman spectroscopy is an effective characterization technique for monitoring the structural and electronic alterations in carbon and has been used as a non-invasive technique in efforts to determine a deep discernment of Li+ storage in carbon materials.48 The schematic illustration of the in situ Raman device is shown in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b depicts the in situ Raman spectrum at the second cycle cathodic process from open-circuit voltage (OCV) to 0.1 V of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC. The introduction of Li+ into the carbonaceous material significantly impacts the intensity, shape and position of the D- and G-band. Clearly, the intensity of the G-band gradually increases with decreasing voltage (Fig. 5c). Such an increase in the G-band is ascribed to the incorporation of Li+, which occupy the defective active sites, thus resulting in an increase in the degree of graphitization of the electrode material. In addition, the position of the D-band did not change obviously. This hints that no clear Li+ intercalation occurred in SNC,49 confirming the “adsorption mechanism” for Li+ storage of SNC. However, in situ Raman analysis of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC at different potentials indicates that no characteristic peaks of Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 can be detected (Fig. S29†). Hence, we could conclude that there are several reasons for the outstanding performance of Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC: (i) the synergistic effects among Fe2O3@Fe3O4 and SNC facilitate improved high electrical conductivity and rapid Li+ diffusion. This not only shortens the Li+ diffusion length and increases electrolyte/electrode contact but also activates high pseudocapacitive charge storage and leads to excellent rate capability and cycle stability; (ii) the low energy barrier promotes the electrode kinetics owing to the strong electronic interaction between Fe2O3@Fe3O4 and SNC, which promotes the formation of homogeneous hetero-interfaces leading to fast and direct electron/ion transfer pathways.

Lastly, as a crucial step to confirm the potential of practical application of the as-prepared Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC electrode in the energy storage device, we fabricated a full-cell LIB using a commercially available LiCoO2 cathode and the as-prepared anode as shown in Fig. 6a. The mass ratio of LiCoO2 to Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC was set to 6.29:1 in order to match their specific energy capacity. Electrochemical performance was evaluated against the total mass of both electrodes. Based on the charge/discharge curves, the working potential of the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC//LCO LIB was 2.74 V (Fig. 6b). The cycle performances maintain a stable reversible capacity (Fig. 6c) with excellent capacity retention. Fig. 6d depicts that the charge capacity of the cell achieved a capacity of 75 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and maintained 40 mA h g−1 at 1000 mA g−1. After the cycling stability test, the full cell LIB could easily power a 3.0 V green LED array (Fig. 6e). According to the Ragone plot in Fig. 6f, the maximum energy and power densities of the full cell LIB are 216 W h kg−1 and 3000 W kg−1, respectively. These results are remarkably higher than those of the recently studied full coin-cell LIBs50–53 and further demonstrate that our Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC is a promising anode material for LIBs.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that low-temperature calcination of new S,N-containing Fe4-based MOCs could generate the Fe2O3@Fe3O4 hybrid embedded in the S,N dual-doped porous carbon framework. The as-derived Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC hybrid achieved attractive lithium storage performance with an initial capacity up to 1734 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, a cycling performance up to 934 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 230 cycles and a rate performance of 511 mA h g−1 at 3.0 A g−1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the excellent lithium storage property can be attributed to the unique architecture allowing excellent adsorption ability with low energy barrier as a result of the strong intrinsic electronic interaction within the electrode matrix. The full-cell LIB assembled based on the Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC anode and the commercial LiCoO2 cathode also achieved a superior energy density of 216 W h kg−1 and a power density of 3000 W kg−1, demonstrating the potential application of such a Fe2O3@Fe3O4-SNC composite as the LIB anode. This work creates an opportunity for the synthesis of low-cost and high-performance Fe-MOC-derived electrode materials for LIBs.
