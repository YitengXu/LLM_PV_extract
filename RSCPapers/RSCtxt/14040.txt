    , Accepted 9th November 2012First published on 12th November 2012AbstractDiscrete and uniform microporous CoO nanoparticles with open nanochannels around 1 nm were one-pot synthesized by the self gas-leaching method via the thermal decomposition of a Co–oleylamine complex. CoO particle-sizes can be tuned from 50 to 13 nm by controlling the concentration of the cobalt precursor, accompanying a change of the long and winding nanochannels to short and straight nanochannels. It was shown that exposing the particle interiors to external active reactants via the shorter and straighter microporous nanochannels in smaller CoO nanoparticles can greatly enhance their photocatalytic efficiency. Most importantly, all the as-synthesized microporous CoO nanoparticles showed a very highly reversible capacity and cycling stability for lithium storage. The discharge and charge capacities of the microporous CoO sample with short straight nanochannels and the smallest particle size (1432.8 and 1200 mA h g−1, respectively) are up to two times higher than those of the commercial CoO powder (673.7 and 539 mA h g−1, respectively) and that of the theoretical value of CoO (715 mA h g−1) owing to the enlarged surface area, very small particle size for increased electrode and electrolyte contact and the heightened diffusion efficiency in short nanochannels for electrolyte and Li ions. The presence of microporous voids could effectively buffer the stress induced during lithium insertion–deinsertion alleviating the pulverization of electrode material, thereby giving extraordinary cycling stability.
Introduction
The architectures with nanopores in nanomaterials are of great interest due to their low material density, large surface area, low coefficients of thermal expansion, and their capacious pores.1–3 These valuable characteristics make them attractive for fundamental research and wide applications in the chemical industry, optoelectronic field and biomedical field.3–6 In particular, the nanoparticles with pores of about 1–3 nm and the consequential peculiar or enhanced properties are particularly important for potential applications in gas sorption, selective catalysis, advanced nanoreactors, hydrogen storage, rechargeable batteries, and drug delivery.7–10
CoO is well-known as an additive to ceramic glazes11 and also as a magnetic storage material.12,13 Significantly, nanosized CoO particles are excellent catalysts, gas sensors, and also potential anode materials for lithium ion batteries.14–16 A new type of nanoscale architecture with microporous nanochannels (<2 nm) in CoO nanoparticles can have advanced and enhanced chemical functions since the micropores can provide selective surface permeability for external reactants to access the particle interior, and can also lead to a lower material density with a larger surface area in chemical reactions.17–19
Traditionally, nanoporous materials are fabricated by a template-directed method with block copolymers1,17 or using a surfactant7–9,20 as a template. This process normally involves a multi-step synthesis: preparing templates, mixing with desired materials, and removal of templates.2,3 Recently, it was found that the nanoparticles with nanopores could be fabricated in one step using one of several self-templated synthesis approaches including the Kirkendall effect and Ostwald ripening.21 However, the nanopores formed have sizes almost 10 nm larger than those formed using one-pot self-templated synthesis techniques. Moreover, the chemical compositions of conventional microporous particles were mainly based on silica or carbon. Until now, methods have rarely been reported for the synthesis of mesoporous CoO micropowder.22 To the best of our knowledge, microporous CoO nanoparticles have never been reported before.
In this work, we present an easy and cheap process for the one-pot synthesis of discrete and uniform microporous CoO nanoparticles without any additional embedded templates. Numerous open and microporous nanochannels with sizes of around 1 nm in CoO nanoparticles can be fabricated by using the produced gases as a self-template. The nanoarchitecture with microporous nanochannels in CoO nanoparticles can greatly improve the photocatalytic efficiency for UV-visible (UV-vis) degradation of rhodamine B (RhB). Most importantly, our materials showed highly enhanced reversible capacity and cycling stability for lithium storage. Reducing particle size and straightening the nanochannels, leading to the shortening of the pore length, will improve significantly the Li storage properties. Monodispersed microporous CoO nanoparticles with internal short nanochannels are promising anode materials for high performance Li ion batteries.
Experimental
Synthesis
Co(acetylacetonate)3 [Co(acac)3, 99%, Aldrich], oleylamine (96%, Aldrich), ethanol (99.8%, Aldrich), and hexane (99%, Aldrich) were used as purchased without further purification. The commercial CoO powder (99.99%) was purchased from Aladdin Reagent Company (the TEM images of the powder show that it is the agglomeration of numerous nanoparticles with a particle diameter around 40–60 nm as seen from Fig. S1†). The microporous CoO nanoparticles were chemically prepared by a mild temperature organic solution reaction23,24 under an argon atmosphere. In a typical synthesis technique, a mixture of Co(acac)3 (0.572 g, 1.6 mmol, sample 1, S1) and oleylamine (21.4 g, 80 mmol) was heated to 135 °C and kept at this temperature for 90 min with magnetic stirring. The resulting red solution was heated to 210 °C over 5 min and kept at this temperature for 60 min. While keeping other synthetic conditions fixed, varied amounts of Co(acac)3 were used with 0.286 g (0.8 mmol) for sample 2 (S2) and 0.143 g (0.4 mmol) for sample 3 (S3). After cooling to room temperature naturally, excess ethanol was added to the solution to give a brown precipitate, which was isolated via centrifugation. The CoO nanoparticles were fully washed with ethanol to remove the residual amine on their surface (see Fig. S2†), and were dried under argon before being dispersed in hexane for further use.
Characterization
A diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance) equipped with a Cu Ka rotating anode source (λ = 0.1542 nm) was used to obtain the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800) was used to observe the morphology and size of the samples. The SEM samples were prepared by dropping the hexane suspension onto a silicon slice before drying at room temperature under ambient conditions. A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEM-2100F) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV was applied to characterize the nanostructure of samples, which were prepared by dropping the hexane suspension onto a copper grid coated with a carbon film. N2 adsorption analysis was carried out with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The samples were introduced into the quartz tube via dropping and drying the hexane suspension, and were outgassed at 120 °C overnight before the measurement. The surface area was obtained by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the pore-size distribution was calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherm using the Horvath–Kawazoe (HK) method. The optical absorption spectra were recorded by a UV-vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-2550) for the hexane suspension of nanoparticles with the same mass.
Properties evaluation
The photocatalytic performance was evaluated via degradation of RhB under simulated solar light. Different samples (10 mg) suspended in hexane were deposited uniformly on 10 × 10 mm quartz slices by dropping and drying under ambient conditions. The quartz substrates with catalytic films were put into 10−5 M (10 mL) RhB aqueous solution, and then were exposed to the simulated solar light with UV-vis irradiation. This was generated by a xenon lamp (Perfectlight PLS-SXE-300) with a power of 300 W and a center wavelength of 465 nm. Solutions of about 0.5 mL were taken out after different irradiation times for optical absorption measurements. The photocatalytic performance was analyzed by monitoring the optical absorption peak of RhB at 554 nm. The electrochemical performance was evaluated via a CR2032-type coin cell on a LAND (CT2001A) multichannel battery test system. Batteries were fabricated using a mixture made of CoO samples, acetylene black, and PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) in a 60:30:10 weight ratio as the working electrode, 1 M solution of LiPF6 in ethylene carbon (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1, in wt%) as electrolyte, and a lithium foil as the counter electrode. The mixture was prepared by dropping the hexane suspension of CoO nanoparticles into the acetylene black with continuous grinding and drying under ambient conditions. Galvanostatic discharge/charge measurements were performed in a potential range of 3–0.05 V vs. Li+/Li.
Results and discussion
The mechanism for synthesizing microporous CoO nanoparticles is schematized above. As depicted in Fig. 1a, a Co–oleylamine complex25,26 with red color was prepared at 135 °C and was then thermally decomposed at 210 °C. At this temperature the CoO nanoparticles were produced by reducing Co(acac)3 with oleylamine, which has a deoxidization activity as previously reported.26,27 The chemical reaction produced gases,27 which contain CO and NH3. The balanced reaction25–27 can be described as Co(C5H7O2)3 + C18H35NH2 → C5H7O + C17H35 + CoO + CO + NH3. Meanwhile, the fast release of the gas molecules led to the formation of microporous nanochannels during the synthesis of nanoparticles (see Fig. S3 and S4†). Decreasing the reaction time from 3 h to 1 h at 210 °C could also prevent the further growth of the formed microporous Co nanoparticles to larger solid nanocrystals without nanopores.25 The process is similar to our previous work on using by-product CH4 as a template to produce highly hierarchically organized meso-macroporous Al2O3 powder from trimethylaluminium as a single source molecular precursor.28 The representative FESEM image of as-synthesized CoO nanoparticles from sample 1 is shown in Fig. 1b. The uniform nanoparticles with a monodispersed particle size of about 50 nm have a very rough surface, induced by the surface micropores.

The as-synthesized microporous structured nanoparticles were further characterized using XRD and TEM. High-magnification views of as-synthesized microporous CoO nanoparticles through HRTEM are shown in Fig. 2. For the TEM images, the different contrast between the particles (black region) and nanopores (white region) results from the higher electron penetration efficiency on pores.7,17,24 As seen from Fig. 2a, the CoO nanoparticles from sample 1 have a homogeneous morphology with a uniform size of about 50 nm and numerous micropores within the discrete nanoparticles, which is consistent with the preliminary SEM observation. By decreasing the concentration of the cobalt precursor, the particle size of CoO nanoparticles of sample 2 decreased to approximately 25 nm as shown in Fig. 2b. Meanwhile, many open, long, and winding nanochannels can be clearly observed with a pore diameter close to 1 nm in the particles (see Fig. S3†). Further decreasing the concentration of the cobalt precursor would lead to the formation of even smaller CoO nanoparticles with an average size of about 13 nm as shown in Fig. 2c for sample 3. The nanoparticles exhibit short and straight nanochannels with a pore diameter of around 1 nm (see Fig. S4†). The HRTEM lattice image in Fig. 2d shows the lattice fringes with an adjacent fringe spacing of 1.5 Å corresponding to the (220) planes for cubic CoO, in agreement with the XRD data analysis. The average size of the micropores of around 1 nm for the three different CoO samples does not evidence any changes, indicating the identical gas molecules produced as a self-template during the reaction under varied conditions.

The XRD patterns of as-synthesized microporous CoO nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 3a. For the XRD pattern, the main peaks correspond to the (111), (200) and (220) planes of cubic CoO with a rock salt structure with a space group of Fm3m (JCPDS 75-0393). The gradually broadened and lowered peaks indicate the decrease in particle size from samples 1 to 3, which is reasonably consistent with the HRTEM observation. The pore size distribution curves of as-synthesized microporous CoO nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 3b, which are calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherm using the HK method.7 The HK pore-size analysis result demonstrates that all the CoO nanoparticles have approximately 1 nm micropores, which confirms the HRTEM observations. Meanwhile, the N2 adsorption isotherms of CoO nanoparticles give the BET surface area of 19 m2 g−1 for sample 1, 28 m2 g−1 for sample 2 and 56 m2 g−1 for sample 3. The decrease in particle size and the creation of more discrete straight nanochannels lead to the formation of materials with a higher surface area.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of as-synthesized microporous CoO nanoparticles and the relative spectral distribution for the simulated solar light in our experiment are presented in Fig. 4. Normally, the bulk CoO has an absorption peak at 478 nm in the visible region, corresponding to the band gap of 2.6 eV.11 Obviously, the absorption peak around 450 nm for CoO nanoparticles from sample 1 was blueshifted compared to bulk CoO. The peaks further shifted to 430 nm for sample 2 and to 410 nm for sample 3 with the decrease in particle size, due to the remarkable quantum size effect.29,30 Meanwhile, an additional deep ultraviolet absorption peak around 272 nm was observed for CoO nanoparticles of sample 1. The peak was redshifted from 290 nm for sample 2 to 307 nm for sample 3 with the reduction of particle size. These additional absorption peaks in the UV region can be attributed to the local plasmon resonance of metal Co atoms.30,31 The lower and blueshifted absorption peaks in the visible region observed from samples 2 and 3 with the same mass compared to those of sample 1 could suggest that samples 2 and 3 have low light absorption and would have much poorer performance than sample 1 for utilization of the simulated solar light with a center wavelength of 465 nm in the irradiation for photocatalysis.

The photocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized CoO nanoparticles and the commercial CoO nanopowder (BET surface area of 5 m2 g−1) in the degradation of RhB under UV-vis irradiation with simulated solar light is shown in Fig. 5. After 150 min irradiation, the relative concentration of RhB is 45.8% for commercial powder, 26.1% for sample 1, 12.7% for sample 2, and 1.5% for sample 3. The as-synthesized microporous CoO nanoparticles exhibit very high photocatalytic efficiency, owing to their discrete and uniform nanosized particles with micropores while due to the large particle size, the aggregation and the large interparticulate porosity, the photocatalytic performance of the commercial CoO powder is much lower than that of our synthesized samples.20 Based on the pseudo-first-order reaction model,32,33 it can be deduced that the degradation rate of CoO sample 3 is roughly twice that of sample 2 and three times higher than that of sample 1. The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of sample 3 cannot be attributed only to its larger specific surface areas (measured in the N2 adsorption experiments), because the CoO sample 3 obviously has poorer performance than samples 2 and 1 for utilization of the simulated solar light in photocatalytic experiments.34,35
 Fig. 5  RhB photodegradation rate of the blank experiment, as-synthesized CoO nanoparticles and commercial powder (CP). The inset shows the time-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra for RhB in the presence of sample 3. 
During the photocatalytic process, the CoO nanoparticles absorbed the UV-vis light to generate electrons and holes, which reacted with the water molecules and produced the hydroxyl radical species32,33 (˙OH) to decompose the RhB. In addition to the reaction occurring at the particle surface, the open and selective nanochannels with sizes of around 1 nm could allow the entry of H2O molecules to the particle interior and the deinsertion of produced ˙OH species to decompose the surface RhB. The reaction rate of degrading RhB with ˙OH species from the interior micropores was dependent on the length and structure of pores.36 As a result, compared with samples 2 and 1, the open micropores in CoO sample 3 could allow more rapid diffusion for H2O insertion and for ˙OH deinsertion due to their shorter and straighter channels as observed from the HRTEM.36,37 Thus the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency induced by the shorter and straighter microporous nanochannels in CoO nanoparticles could evidently compensate the negative influence from their relatively poor utilization of the simulated solar light.
The electrochemical performance of CoO samples was also evaluated. The representative discharge–charge voltage profiles for the first cycle are shown in Fig. 6a. For the discharge curves, the sloping plateau at about 1–0.7 V (for commercial powder: 1.3–0.8 V) reflected Li+ charge steps including the lithium storage into microporous CoO nanoparticles and the conversion reaction CoO + 2Li+ + 2e → Co + Li2O.38 The decrease below 0.5 V could be attributed to the interaction of Co particles with electrolyte for the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer. The charge profiles (Li deinsertion) consist of two regions. The first region located between 0 and 2.0 V is associated with the interactions between Co and the electrolyte. The second region above 2.0 V is related to the oxidation of Co with Li2O, the reverse reaction of Li charging. The first discharge and charge capacities are about 673.7 and 539 mA h g−1 for commercial powder, 1099 and 901 mA h g−1 for sample 1, 1209.6 and 1000.3 mA h g−1 for sample 2 and 1432.8 and 1200 mA h g−1 for sample 3, respectively, corresponding to the coulombic efficiency of about 80%, 82%, 82.7% and 83.8%, respectively. The efficiency in the second cycle increases to approximately 85% for commercial powder, 93% for sample 1, 96% for sample 2, and 98% for sample 3. Thereafter, it stabilizes at above 99% until 18 cycles for commercial powder, 9 cycles for sample 1, 6 cycles for sample 2, and 4 cycles for sample 3. The first discharge and charge capacities and the coulombic efficiency of as-synthesized CoO nanoparticles are much higher than those of the commercial powder and that of the theoretical value of CoO (715 mA h g−1),39 due to the increased contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte induced by the discrete and uniform nanosized particles.40 The initial capacity differences between as-synthesized CoO nanoparticles could be reasonably attributed to the contrast of their special surface areas.40,41
 Fig. 6  (a) Voltage profiles for the CoO samples during the 1st cycle under a current density of 0.2 C and (b) cycling performance of the CoO samples under a current density of 0.2 C. 
It was reported that the discharge and charge capacities of nanosized CoO with a grain size of 6.59 nm and a surface area of 89.8 m2 g−1 prepared by a very well controlled method using Co(OH)2 as a precursor can reach 1276 and 900 mA h g−1, respectively.42,43 The anomalous high capacity is due to the formation of oxygen-rich CoO materials and very small particle size. Huang et al. prepared self-assembled CoO nanodiscs and their performance as long-life anode materials was evaluated. They found that their hierarchically nanostructured CoO formed by orderly self-stacked mesoporous nanodiscs of less than 10 nm in thickness and 3–5 μm in diameter have discharge and charge capacities as high as 1301.8 and 965.2 mA h g−1, respectively. They attributed this excellent performance to the advantageous combination of small primary nanoparticles (∼5 nm), the mesoporous, ultrathin and the large area 2D structure and the orderly self-stacked 3D nanostructure. Our sample 3 with very small monodispersed nanoparticles with short and straight microchannels of 1 nm has even higher discharge and charge capacities (1432.8 and 1200 mA h g−1, respectively) compared to the values published in the literature.39,42,43 This excellent performance is certainly related to its small particle size and more particularly the short and straight nanochannels that facilitate the diffusion and the filling up of Li ions and electrolyte into the pores which leads to a large amount of CoO involved in either the intercalation reaction or conversion reaction. Thus the shorter and straighter nanochannels lead to the enhancement of charge–discharge capacity and rate capability. Furthermore, the short pore length can also reduce the Li ion diffusion path in the pore and consequently influence the Li storage, kinetically.44

Fig. 6b depicts the discharge–charge cycling performance at a current rate of C/5. The capacity loss after the initial 1–2 cycles was mainly caused by the formation of a solid–electrolyte interface (SEI).38 The further capacity loss was normally dependent on the path length and volume change for lithium insertion–deinsertion.38–41 The capacity steadied at 184 mA h g−1 after ∼41 cycles for sample 1, at 445.8 mA h g−1 after ∼33 cycles for sample 2, and at 936.2 mA h g−1 after ∼20 cycles for sample 3. After 50 cycles, the capacities of CoO samples 1–3 reduced to, respectively, 17%, 37%, and 65% of the initial capacities. The capacity differences between the CoO sample 3 and 2 or 1 after 50 cycles became more evident, compared with that after the first cycle. This result indicates that the highly enhanced lithium storage capacity and excellent cycling performance can not only be attributed to the enlarged surface areas, but could also result from the fact that the open micropores with shorter and straighter nanochannels could provide much shorter path lengths for lithium ion diffusion to the particle interior,45–48 and prevent the insertion of other interfering molecules. Meanwhile, the microporous voids could also effectively buffer the stress induced during lithium insertion–deinsertion, alleviating the pulverization of electrode material.41,47–50 As a result, these microporous CoO nanoparticles also show much better cycling stability than solid particles with similar sizes.38,45 Further studies are being focused on the combination of microporous CoO nanoparticles with other highly conductive nanomaterials such as graphene and metal Ag or Cu particles.
Conclusion
Discrete and uniform microporous CoO nanoparticles with open nanochannels of around 1 nm were one-pot synthesized by the thermal decomposition of a Co–oleylamine complex using the produced gases as a self-template. The particle sizes can be controlled from 50 to 13 nm by reducing the concentration of the cobalt precursor. With the decrease of CoO particle size, the nanochannels can be changed from long and winding to short and straight. For UV-visible light degradation of RhB, it reveals that the shorter and straighter microporous nanochannels in smaller CoO nanoparticles can obviously be helpful in enhancing their photocatalytic efficiency, through the extended contact surface area with water molecules and increased diffusion efficiency for active species. As for the lithium ion battery, the architectures with these micropores in smaller CoO nanoparticles can be useful to improve their reversible capacity and cycling stability, through the enlarged chemical contact area with the electrode and electrolyte and heightened diffusion efficiency for lithium ion insertion–deinsertion. The one-pot mechanism could be used to guide the synthesis of similar microporous nanostructures. For example, our current preliminary result shows that reacting similar reactants can lead to nanoporous ZnO nanoparticles.
