    , Accepted 30th March 2016First published on 31st March 2016AbstractNew D–π–A type sensitizers (YC dyes), comprising arylamine as the electron donor, dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-d][1,2,3]triazole (DTBZ) as the rigidified π-conjugated spacer, and 2-cyanoacrylic acid as both the acceptor and anchor, have been synthesized. The YC sensitizers displayed broad absorption of light, from 362 nm to 550 nm, with a molar extinction coefficient as high as ∼54800 M−1 cm−1. The light-to-electricity conversion efficiencies of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) ranged from 5.82 to 8.51% under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination. Upon addition of 5 mM of CDCA as a coadsorbent, the best performing cell displayed an efficiency of 9.10%, surpassing that of the N719-based standard cell (8.12%), and even achieved an efficiency of 10.56% under quarter sunlight illumination.
1. Introduction
Because of their facile device fabrication and high power-conversion efficiency (PCE), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention and are anticipated to have great potential for commercialization, especially for indoor use such as for the internet of things.1 Of the major components of DSSCs, sensitizers play an important role, as their light harvesting is a prerequisite for the conversion of solar energy to electricity. Up to now, of the single sensitizer-based DSSCs, the highest cell efficiencies (under AM 1.5 conditions) have been achieved for polypyridyl ruthenium, zinc–porphyrin, and metal-free sensitizers, with values of 11.5%,2 13.0%,3 and 13.0%,4 respectively. It is worth noting that metal-free dyes are now very competitive with the metal-containing sensitizers, and have yielded remarkably high cell efficiencies (>12%).4–10 Of these metal-free dyes, the highest PCE with collaborative sensitizers has been reported to be over 14% under one sun illumination.10 Moreover, metal-free dyes have the advantages of low cost, easy purification, and flexibility in molecular design.
Common metal-free sensitizers have a characteristic donor–(π-conjugated spacer)–acceptor (D–π–A) skeleton. In order to improve light harvesting in the visible and/or near-IR region, the π-conjugated spacer can be interposed with an electron-deficient unit11–13 or a rigidified π-conjugated spacer (RS).14 Using the latter spacer is beneficial for broadening and intensifying the absorption. In recent years, a special class of metal-free sensitizers with a rigidified conjugated segment comprising fused electron-deficient and electron-rich aromatics, including dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]oxadiazole (BTBF),15 dithieno[3,2-f:2′,3′-h]quinoxaline (DTQ),16,17 dithieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyro-lo[3,2-e:2′,3′-g][2,1,3]benzothiadiazole (DTPBT)18 and dithieno[3,2-b]pyrrolobenzotriazole (BZTP),19,20 have been reported by us and Cao, respectively. Because of the intense and broad absorption of the dyes, the fabricated DSSCs exhibited good conversion efficiencies. On the other hand, the more coplanar conjugated spacer tended to result in intermolecular aggregation of the dyes.21,22
More planar molecules have a higher tendency to aggregate, and this concept has been widely applied to design molecules for organic field-effect transistors because of better intermolecular electronic coupling.23,24 However, molecular aggregation usually leads to the quenching of the photo-excited state and hampers injection of electrons from the sensitizer to the photoanode in DSSCs. Therefore, rigidified π-conjugated segments are normally tethered with bulkier substituents to suppress aggregation of the dye,25,26 which can also improve the solubility of the dyes in common organic solvents. In our previous studies on sensitizers with rigid spacers comprising fused electron-deficient and electron-rich aromatics, we found that bulky substituents failed to completely suppress dye aggregation. However, light harvesting in the longer-wavelength region, resulting from J-aggregation of the dyes, could compensate for the photocurrent. In this way, a decent cell performance was achieved upon addition of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as the coadsorbent to alleviate the adverse effects of dye aggregation.21,27,28
We previously reported three dyes, BZ-1, YC-1 and BZTP-1, with increasing π-conjugation from BZ-1 to BZTP-1.19 The dye BZ-1 has a benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole entity (BZ) as the conjugated spacer, and the latter two have BZ fused with electron-rich aromatics: dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-d][1,2,3]triazole (DTBZ) for YC-1 and dithieno[3,2:b]pyrrolobenzotriazole (BZTP) for BZTP-1. Though BZTP-1 has been reported to display a cell efficiency (8.4%) about 10% higher than that of YC-1 (7.5%), the procedure used to synthesize the former is more complicated. Here, we attempted to further develop the YC dyes by extending the conjugation length of YC-1via insertion of thiophene (T) or 3-n-hexyl-thiophene (HT) into the π-conjugated spacer, or variation of the electron donor including triphenylamine (TPA), 9-(2-ethylhexyl)-9H-carbazole (CBZ) and 4-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (TID). The DSSCs fabricated from the new dyes had good efficiencies, with the highest efficiency reaching 9.10% when the coadsorbent CDCA was added. Under weaker sunlight, the efficiency even reached 10.56%. Relevant physical studies were also carried out, and the correlation between the dye structure and the cell performance has been elucidated.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis of YC sensitizers
The structures of the new dyes are shown in Fig. 1 and the synthetic routes are outlined in Scheme 1. Previously reported DTBZ19 was converted to the dibromo derivative Br-DTBZ-Brvia treatment with NBS. Palladium was used to catalyze the Stille coupling reaction29 of Br-DTBZ-Br with the corresponding arylamine-containing stannyl reagents, and this reaction afforded 1a and 1b. Further Stille coupling reactions of these intermediates with the corresponding arylstannyl reagents containing a protected formyl entity produced 2a–2c, which then underwent Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid to give YC-2, YC-4 and YC-5. In comparison, YC-3 and YC-6 were derived from the monobromo derivative of DTBZ, i.e., DTBZ-Br. The Stille coupling reaction of DTBZ-Br with arylstannyl reagents containing a protected formyl entity was carried out first to give 3, and subsequent bromination of 3 afforded 4. The second Stille coupling reaction with arylamine-containing stannyl reagents, followed by Knoevenagel condensation produced YC-3 and YC-6.

2.2. UV-vis absorption properties of YC sensitizers
UV-vis absorption spectra of YC sensitizers in THF at a concentration of 10 μM are shown in Fig. 2(a), and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The high-energy absorption peaks between 344 and 390 nm arose from π–π* transitions, and the low-energy peaks between 434 and 473 nm were attributed to the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) transitions from the donor to the acceptor mixed with π–π* character. Compared with YC-1,19 insertion of a thiophene ring between DTBZ and cyanoacetic acid (YC-2) led to both bathochromic (434 vs. 468 nm) and hyperchromic (molar extinction coefficient, ε: 29500 vs. 43800 M−1 cm−1) shifts of the ICT band. These shifts can be ascribed to the better conjugation of YC-2. Replacement of the TPA donor with CBZ or TID resulted in a hyperchromic shift of the ICT band due to a better orbital overlap of the HOMO and LUMO (vide infra, see Theoretical approach section).

The absorption width at half maximum for the sensitizers adsorbed on the TiO2 film was larger than that in the THF solution and there was a prominent increase in the long-wavelength region (Fig. S1† and Table 1), indicating the existence of J-aggregation. Upon addition of 5 mM of CDCA, all dyes displayed blue-shifted absorption on the TiO2 film, which provided further evidence of dye aggregation (Fig. 2(b)). Dye aggregation appeared to be affected by a couple of factors: (1) the pyramidal TPA donor could more effectively avoid dye aggregation compared to the more planar CBZ and TID donors; and (2) incorporation of the n-hexyl chain at the thiophene (HT) helped with the alleviation of dye aggregation. For example, the absorbance vs. dye concentration plot was found to deviate from linearity at high concentrations more so for YC-3 than for YC-2 (Fig. S2(b)†). Although dye aggregation normally deteriorates the electron injection of the excited state molecule,30 there are some cases indicating that J-aggregation could improve the cell performance since their light harvesting at longer wavelengths are improved.19,31–34 This improvement can be seen by comparing the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSSCs (vide infra).
2.3. Electrochemical properties of YC sensitizers
The electrochemical properties of the YC dyes were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in THF solutions at a concentration of 1 mM (Fig. S3†), and the relevant data are listed in Table 1. The first quasi-reversible one-electron oxidation, E1/2(OX), detected at values about 523–562 mV more positive than that of ferrocene/ferrocenium (FC/FC+, 0.7 V),35 was attributed to the removal of an electron from the arylamine donor (TPA, CBZ or TID). The first oxidation potential (EOX) was observed to decrease in the order YC-5 ≈ YC-4 ≈ YC-1 > YC-2 ≈ YC-3 > YC-6. The more positive potentials of YC-4 and YC-5 than of YC-2 and YC-3 can be attributed to the better electron donor in the latter (with the donor strength, TPA > TID > CBZ, according to the results of the TD-DFT calculations as shown in Fig. S4† and the literature15). Though TID is a slightly weaker donor than is TPA, YC-6 has a less positive oxidation potential than does YC-3 because of the better planarity of the former, i.e., the dihedral angle between TID and DTBZ was observed to be smaller than that between TPA and DTBZ (10.7° vs. 24.0°; vide infra, Fig. 3). The significantly higher oxidation potential of YC-1 than YC-2 can be rationalized by the stronger interaction between the acceptor and the donor due to YC-1 having the shortest conjugation length. The EOX values of the sensitizers were found to range from 1.21 to 1.26 V (vs. NHE, see Table 1), which are higher than that of the I−/I3− redox coupler (0.4–0.53 V vs. NHE)36 and sufficient for dye regeneration. The excited state potential (E*0–0) of the sensitizer was estimated from the difference between the EOX at the ground state and the zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) obtained from the onset of the UV-vis absorption spectra. The calculated E*0–0 values range from −1.09 to −1.22 V (vs. NHE), indicating the electron injection from the excited sensitizers into the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode (conduction band edge: −0.5 V vs. NHE)37 to be thermodynamically favourable.

2.4. Theoretical approach of YC sensitizers
Density functional theory (DFT) as well as time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT)38 calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level using Q-Chem 4.0 software were carried out on the sensitizers in order to relate molecular structure to DSSC performance. The results of the TD-DFT calculations are summarized in Table S1.† The ground-state dihedral angles between the DTBZ core and the neighbouring segments and the selected frontier orbitals of the dye molecules are shown in Fig. 3 and S5,† respectively. The dihedral angle between the donor and DTBZ segment was calculated to decrease in the order CBZ (27.2–28.1°) > TPA (17.8–24.0°) > TID (10.7°), whereas that between DTBZ segment and π-spacers was calculated to increase from T (0.2–0.8°) to HT (8.1–9.9°) spacer. A significantly smaller dihedral angle between DTBZ and TID may have been the cause of higher dye aggregation of YC-6. Incorporation of the n-hexyl chain at the thiophene ring only resulted in a minimal increase of the dihedral angle (8.1–9.9°) between the thiophene and the DTBZ unit.
The electron density of the HOMO in these compounds was mainly distributed from the donor to the conjugated spacer, whereas that of the LUMO was largely distributed from 2-cyanoacrylic acid (Ac) to the spacer. The S0-to-S1 transition was nearly 100% of the HOMO → LUMO transition, and the ICT character was evident, which is helpful for the injection of electrons into the TiO2 conduction band. The Mulliken charge changes39 between the ground and excited states during the electronic transition were calculated using TD-DFT, and the results of these calculations are shown in Table S1;† the Mulliken charge variation for the S1 and S2 states is shown in Fig. S6.† It is interesting that the DTBZ segment of YC-1 trapped significant negative charge for the S0 → S1 transition and can be deemed as the acceptor. Upon insertion of a thiophene ring between DTBZ and the anchor (YC-2 and YC-3), there was negligible negative charge and DTBZ can be considered as the secondary electron donor as it provided significant positive charge for the S0 → S2 transition. When TPA was replaced with CBZ (YC-4 and YC-5), the electron-donating character of DTBZ became more prominent and there was a significant positive charge at DTBZ even for the S0 → S1 transition. When TID was used as the donor (YC-6), DTBZ had less positive charge for the S0 → S1 transition and significant negative charge for the S0 → S2 transition. Therefore, the role of DTBZ varies as the donor and the spacer change.
2.5. Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of YC sensitizers
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristic plots and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of DSSCs with YC sensitizers and a liquid electrolyte containing 0.8 M of PMII, 0.1 M of LiI, 0.05 M of I2, and 0.5 M of TBP in acetonitrile under AM 1.5 full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) illumination are shown in Fig. 4, and the relevant cell performance data are listed in Table 2. The cell efficiency of YC sensitizers decreased in the order YC-5 (8.51%) > YC-4 (7.52%) > YC-2 (6.87%) ≈ YC-1 (6.85%) > YC-3 (5.95%) > YC-6 (5.82%). The dye loading amounts were measured to be 0.362, 0.343, 0.303, 0.453, 0.438, and 0.201 μmol cm−2 for YC-1,19YC-2, YC-3, YC-4, YC-5 and YC-6, respectively. The higher dye loading of YC-4 and YC-5 than of YC-1 to YC-3 may be attributed to the more planar donor (CBZ) in the former, which allowed more compact packing of the dyes on the TiO2 surface. The particularly low solubility of YC-6 in the solvent likely contributed to its having displayed the lowest dye loading of the compounds tested. Indeed, we found that the deviation of the absorbance vs. concentration plot from linearity occurred for the lower concentrations of YC-6 (Fig. S2(b)†) when compared with other dyes. Though the cell efficiency was roughly consistent with the dye-loading amount, dye loading was not the sole factor affecting the efficiency. That YC-6 displayed the poorest cell performance of all the compounds tested can be ascribed to its having displayed the lowest dye loading and least efficient dark-current suppression (vide infra). The high JSC value of YC-2, compared to that of YC-1, as well as the high JSC values of the YC-4 and YC-5 cells can be attributed to their better light harvesting (vide supra) including their absorption at longer wavelengths due to J-aggregation (Fig. 4). An interesting difference between YC-2 and YC-3 is that the latter displayed a significantly lower JSC, which was largely due to its inferior solar-to-electricity conversion in the long-wavelength region (Fig. 4(b)). This observation indicated that an appropriate J-aggregation of the dyes can produce a positive contribution to the cell performance. A prominent feature of the dyes in this study was that J-aggregation of the dyes significantly contributed to the photocurrent in the longer wavelength region (>600 nm), as evidenced from the IPCE spectra (Fig. 4(b)). There are precedents of J-aggregation-enhanced light harvesting in the literature.16,19,31–34,40–42 Nevertheless, dye aggregation normally quenches the excited state and jeopardizes electron injection.30 And we found, for example, YC-6 to have less efficient photon-to-electron conversion in the long-wavelength region compared to YC-4 and YC-5 even though its TiO2 film spectrum was significantly broadened in the same region (Fig S7†). Of all the dyes tested, YC-5 yielded the best cell efficiency (8.51%), which not only surpassed that of YC-1 (6.85%) by 20%, but was also higher than that of N719 (8.12%). This outcome may have been due to (1) high dye loading of YC-5 enhancing light harvesting, (2) the n-hexyl chain on the thiophene π-spacer of YC-5 helping with suppression of dark current (vide infra), (3) significant light harvesting in the long-wavelength region, and (4) a greater upward shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge upon dye adsorption (vide infra), leading to a higher VOC. The VOC values of the cells decreased in the order YC-5 > YC-1 > YC-4 > YC-3 > YC-2 > YC-6. As the VOC value was found to depend on both the TiO2 conduction band edge and electron recombination occurring between the TiO2 photoanode and the electrolyte (dark current, Fig. 4(a)), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and charge extraction studies were carried out in order to elucidate the origin of the photovoltage variation (vide infra).

2.6. EIS analysis and IMVS analysis of YC sensitizers
EIS is generally used to investigate the interfacial charge-transfer kinetics of DSSCs by measuring the impedance at a forward bias.43 The Nyquist plots of the DSSCs in the current study were obtained under the open-circuit condition at a bias of 0.65 V in the dark (Fig. 5(a)), and a suitable equivalent circuit model was used to fit the Nyquist plots of the DSSCs (the inset of Fig. 5(a)). From low to high impedance, the two semicircles related to the resistance (R1) at the Pt/electrolyte interface and the resistance (R2) at the TiO2/electrolyte interface, respectively. R1 values were similar for all sensitizers (3.7–4.7 Ω) as Pt was used as the counter electrode in all cases. A larger R2 value indicates a smaller dark current. The R2 values of the DSSCs decreased in the order YC-5 (309.2 Ω) > YC-1 (188.6 Ω) > YC-4 (142.2 Ω) > YC-3 (101.5 Ω) > YC-2 (87.9 Ω) > YC-6 (33.3 Ω), which were in accordance with the order of the VOC values and opposite to the order of the dark currents. Electron recombination lifetime (τr) was also estimated from the Bode phase plot (Fig. 5(b)) via τr = 1/(2πfmax), where fmax is the frequency. The order of decreasing τr values, YC-5 (29.0 ms) > YC-1 (19.9 ms) ≈ YC-4 (19.9 ms) > YC-3 (7.5 ms) ≈ YC-2 (7.5 ms) > YC-6 (0.4 ms), paralleled that of the R2 values. The much shorter electron lifetime for YC-6 compared to the other dyes can be attributed to insufficient coverage of the TiO2 surface because of low dye loading (vide supra). The sensitizers comprising CBZ-donors (YC-4 and YC-5) displayed larger τr values than those comprising TPA-donor (YC-2 and YC-3). This outcome could also be ascribed to the higher dye loading and therefore more compact dye packing of YC-4 and YC-5 (vide supra), which would have more effectively blocked the electrolytes from the TiO2 surface.

The electron lifetimes of the DSSCs were further measured at the open-circuit condition by intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS, Fig. 5(c)).44,45 When at the same light intensity, the order of the electron lifetimes, YC-5 > YC-1 > YC-4 > YC-3 > YC-2 ≫ YC-6, was in line with the order of the VOC values. The EIS and IMVS measurements indicated several factors beneficial to preventing the oxidized electrolytes from approaching the TiO2 surface, i.e., suppression of dark current: (1) incorporation of an alkyl chain at the thiophene ring between DTBZ and the anchor, such as YC-3vs.YC-2 and YC-5vs.YC-4 (similar observations have been reported in literatures46–48); (2) more compact packing of the dyes due to higher dye loading, i.e., YC-1 to YC-5vs.YC-6, and YC-4vs.YC-2; and (3) a dye molecule with a shorter skeleton, i.e., YC-1vs.YC-2. Perhaps the more void space available between longer skeletons allowed for a more facile penetration of the electrolyte.49
2.7. Charge extraction measurement of YC sensitizers
The VOC value was found to be affected by both the conduction band edge (EC) and the electron density of the TiO2 photoanode. The charge extraction technique50 was used to estimate the TiO2 conduction band edge shift, and the plots of VOCvs. charge density (Q) are shown in Fig. 5(d). Compared with YC-6, all dyes exhibited an upward shift (YC-1, 74 mV; YC-2, 28 mV; YC-3, 38 mV; YC-4, 88 mV; YC-5, 112 mV) of the conduction band edge of the TiO2 photoanode. Except for YC-1, the shift of the EC was approximately in line with the trend of the dipole moments16,51 of the dyes: YC-6 (6.56 D) < YC-1 (7.2 D) ≈ YC-2 (7.4 D) ≈ YC-3 (7.2 D) < YC-4 (8.5 D) ≈ YC-5 (8.6 D), calculated from TD-DFT and summarized in Table S2.† Though the protons released upon dye adsorption should result in a downward shift of the TiO2 conduction band, YC-6 still displayed the most downward shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge of all dyes tested. Therefore, the molecular dipole seems to have a determining influence on the TiO2 conduction band edge.
2.8. Device performance with coadsorbed CDCA
An appropriate amount of CDCA52 was added as the coadsorbent to alleviate dye aggregation and reduce the adverse impact of dye aggregation on electron injection while still retaining light harvesting at longer wavelengths stemming from J-aggregation of the dyes. The J–V curves and IPCE spectra are shown in Fig. 6 and the relevant data are listed in Table 2. As shown in Fig. S8,† the conversion efficiencies were improved for all the cells upon adding CDCA, and they followed the same order as the cells without CDCA except YC-3 (6.58%):YC-6 (6.71%) < YC-1 (7.48%) < YC-2 (7.74%) < YC-4 (8.07%) < YC-5 (9.10%). The efficiency of YC-5 was ∼10% higher than that of the N719-based standard cell (8.12%). Increases in both the VOC and JSC values upon addition of CDCA can be partly attributed to the resulting alleviation of dye aggregation (Fig. 2(b), vide supra). Besides, VOC was found to benefit from better dark-current suppression (Fig. 6(a)) in the presence of CDCA. Better dark-current suppression was also supported by the increased charge-recombination resistance at the TiO2/electrolyte interface after addition of CDCA (YC-2, 87.8 Ω vs. 110.2 Ω; YC-3, 101.5 Ω vs. 128.8 Ω; YC-4, 142.1 Ω vs. 216.3 Ω; YC-5, 309.2 Ω vs. 407.2 Ω; YC-6, 33.3 Ω vs. 84.3 Ω) based on the EIS data in the dark (Fig. S9†). The electron lifetime also increased upon adding CDCA (YC-1, 19.9 vs. 20.0 ms; YC-2, 7.5 vs. 9.1 ms; YC-3, 7.5 vs. 11.1 ms; YC-4, 19.9 vs. 24.0 ms; YC-5, 29.0 vs. 42.5 ms; YC-6, 0.4 vs. 0.7 ms). In order to profit from better light harvesting due to J-aggregation of the dyes without fatal deterioration of electron injection, adequate addition of CDCA is required.27,28 By inspecting the IPCE spectra for the dyes with and without CDCA (Fig. S10†), it was evident that there were significant increases of PCE in the long-wavelength region for YC-1, YC-2, YC-4 and YC-6. Increases of PCE for YC-3 and YC-5 only in the short-wavelength region likely resulted from the lower degree of J-aggregation of these dyes.
 Fig. 6  (a) J–V curves and (b) IPCE of DSSCs based on the YC sensitizers with CDCA as a coadsorbent. 
Future indoor applications of DSSCs require good photovoltaic performance under dim-light conditions. The best cell in this study, CY-5, was also tested at various illumination intensities, ranging from 1 to 0.1 sunlight irradiation (Fig. S11†). The efficiency of the DSSCs based on YC-5 were found to be further increased under weaker sunlight irradiation, and the cell efficiency of YC-5 without and with CDCA reached 10.0 and 10.6%, respectively, under 25% sunlight illumination.
3. Conclusions
Dipolar metal-free organic sensitizers containing a rigidifying planar moiety of fused electron-rich and electron-deficient units, dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-d][1,2,3] triazole (DTBZ), have been synthesized and successfully used as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells. J-Aggregation of the sensitizers on the TiO2 photoanode was found to contribute to the photocurrent, and the cells exhibited a good conversion efficiency (8.51%), surpassing that of the N719-based standard DSSC (8.12%). Upon addition of CDCA as a co-adsorbent, we achieved a cell efficiency as high as 9.1% under full sunlight illumination, and as high as 10.6% under 0.25 sunlight illumination.
4. Experimental section
The procedures used to synthesize the compounds as well as the general measurements and characterizations, quantum chemistry computation, and fabrication of DSSCs are described in the ESI.†
