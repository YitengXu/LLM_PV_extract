    , Accepted 17th August 2011First published on 13th September 2011AbstractA sediment-type photomicrobial fuel cell (PFC), based on the synergistic interaction between microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) and electrochemically active bacteria, was developed to remove carbon and nutrients from wastewater, and produce electricity and algal biomass simultaneously. Under illumination, a stable power density of 68 ± 5 mW m−2 and a biomass of 0.56 ± 0.02 g L−1 were generated at an initial algae concentration of 3.5 g L−1. Accordingly, the removal efficiency of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus was 99.6%, 87.6% and 69.8%, respectively. Mass balance analysis suggested the main removal mechanism of nitrogen and phosphorus was the algae biomass uptake (75% and 93%, respectively), while the nitrification and denitrification process contributed to a part of nitrogen removal (22%). In addition, the effect of illumination period on the performance of PFC was investigated. Except notable fluctuation of power generation, carbon and nutrients removal was not significantly affected after changing the light/dark photoperiod from 24 h/0 h to 10 h/14 h. This work represents the first successful attempt to develop an effective bacteria–algae coupled system, capable for extracting energy and removing carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater in one-step.

Broader context
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a promising technology for simultaneous wastewater treatment and electric energy production. Anodic conversion of organic carbon into electricity is a relatively easy process in MFCs. However, nitrogen removal in MFCs is still too expensive since costly membranes and mechanical aeration are required. Moreover, there is still no report of phosphorus removal in MFCs. Fortunately, microalgae technology for wastewater nutrients treatment has been recently developed, providing a novel, efficient and cost-effective solution for nutrients removal in MFCs. Here, an innovative sediment-type photomicrobial fuel cell (PFC), based on the cooperation between microalgae and electrochemically active bacteria, has been reported. Under illumination, a stable power density of 68 ± 5 mW m−2 and a biomass of 0.56 ± 0.02 g L−1 were generated at an initial algae concentration of 3.5 g L−1. Accordingly, the removal efficiency of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus was 99.6%, 87.6% and 69.8%, respectively. The performance was further improved by optimization of the algae concentration and C/N ratio. This demonstrates that the PFC system offers a straightforward, effective and cost-effective route to remove C, N, P and recover energy and biomass simultaneously, opening an entirely and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment concept.

1. Introduction
Urban wastewater contains organic carbon and nutrients, which can cause eutrophication and deterioration of the natural water quality. These substances need to be removed or captured, before being reused or returned to the environment. While high chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal has been easily achieved in many wastewater treatment systems, the nutrients removal is a more complex and costly process which involves several steps and technologies.1–3 Advanced technologies for both carbon and nutrients removal that minimize environmental impacts and recovery energy are now given high priority.
Recently, microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have drawn much attention as a new approach to treat wastewater, replace energy intensive wastewater treatment processes, and produce clean electric energy or valuable products.4–8 In power-generating MFCs, electrochemically active bacteria transfer electrons produced during oxidation of organic matter to the anode; while oxygen is reduced by accepting electrons from the cathode.5,9,10 Electricity can be generated from various biodegradable organic materials in MFCs, including carbohydrates,11,12 low molecular weight organic acids,13proteins,14 wastes and waste streams, such as dairy manure,15 domestic wastewaters,5 and food process wastewater.16 Anodic conversion of organic carbon into electricity is a relatively easy process in MFCs and has already been widely proven in the literature mentioned above. However, nutrients removal in MFCs, on the other hand, has only received a little attention so far.17–19 In recent studies, simultaneous organic matter, nitrogen removal, and power production were achieved in two-chamber MFC reactors where nitrification was accomplished by a specific aeration.18,19 Even though electric energy and nitrogen removal can be achieved by MFCs, the technology is still too expensive; the employed membranes are costly, and a considerable amount of energy is consumed for nitrification in terms of mechanical aeration. Furthermore, MFCs have little capacity to remove phosphorus, and there is no report of phosphorus removal by MFC technology available so far. Fortunately, the emergence of microalgae technology may bring a good complement to MFCs. It has been known for several years that microalgae can assimilate nitrogen and phosphorus into their biomass as well as carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and produce oxygen, while the biomass can be further used for the production of valuable products (e.g., biodiesel, fertilizer).20,21 However, microalgae have less capacity for organic carbon removal through photosynthesis, have to cooperate with aerobic bacteria to degrade organic carbons, and there is no energy recovery from this process.22 In light of the advantages and disadvantages of MFCs and microalgae, we expect to establish a symbiotic system, based on the cooperation between microalgae and electrochemically active bacteria, for simultaneous organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus removal and electricity production without energy input. Although photosynthetic microorganisms have been introduced to MFCs as oxygen or substrate supply,23,24 organic carbon and nutrients removal in such a symbiotic system has not yet been proposed.
By combining microalgae cultivation and MFC technologies, electrochemically active bacteria in the anode can oxidize organic matter to release electrons, protons and CO2. Meanwhile, with solar illumination, microalgae in the cathode will uptake nitrogen and phosphorus as well as the CO2 released from the anode for photosynthesis. In return, oxygen produced from algal photosynthesis can serve as electron acceptor for electricity generation and possible nitrification process at the cathode. Through this synergistic interaction, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus can be removed from wastewater without extra cost (e.g., mechanical aeration), while electricity and potentially valuable algae biomass can be produced simultaneously.
Based on the above hypothesis, in this study, an innovative sediment-type photomicrobial fuel cell (PFC), which was a combination of microalgae cultivation and MFC technologies, was developed for wastewater treatment. Its performance was investigated in terms of power generation, biomass generation, C, N and P removal and microbial diversity. This study explores a better understanding of an algae–electrochemically active bacteria coupled system and offers new information on cost-effective wastewater treatment.
2. Experimental
2.1 Microalgae culture and media

Chlorella
 vulgaris was purchased from Scandinavian Culture Collection of Algae & Protozoa (Section for Aquatic Biology, University of Copenhagen, Denmark) and grown on modified MWC media at room temperature (22 ± 3 °C).25 The algae suspension was centrifuged (10000 × g) and washed with DI water 3 times to remove residual carbon and nutrient sources before being added to the PFC reactor. The initial concentration (g dry mass L−1) of Chlorella vulgaris was estimated by optical density (OD) at 658 nm according to a correlation curve (ESI, Fig. S1†).
2.2 PFC setup and operation
A sediment MFC was built in a 500 mL glass bottle (Kimax*GL 45 media/storage bottle). The anode, made of carbon paper (surface area 9 cm2, Toray carbon paper, E-TEK division, USA), was placed on the bottom. The cathode, a piece of 5% wet proofed carbon paper containing 0.5 mg Pt cm−2 (surface area 9 cm2, E-TEK), was hung about 5 cm above the anode and connected to the anode using insulated copper wire (Fig. 1). Sediment (water content 25%) from Bagsvaerd Lake (55°46′N, 12°27′E), Denmark, was filled into the glass bottle, producing a 0.5 cm sediment layer (8% of total reactor volume) above the anode. The characteristics of the sediment are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The composition of Bagsvaerd Lake water can be obtained from a previous report.26 Synthetic wastewater containing 197 mg L−1acetate, 53.1 mg L−1NH4+–N and 10 mg L−1 PO43−–P was filled in the bottle, reaching a total water volume of 250 mL. The synthetic wastewater also contained: 1.84 mg L−1 Na2SeO3·5H2O, 70 mg L−1MoO3, 40 mg L−1MnCl2, 44 mg L−1MgSO4, 15 mg L−1CaCl2, 2 mg L−1 FeCl2·4H2O, 3.4 mg L−1MnSO4, and 1.2 mg L−1 (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O. The reactor was started up without algae addition (sediment MFC mode), and the cathode solution was aerated with air pumps. 10 mL of the synthetic wastewater was added into the reactor once a day to compensate for the evaporation loss and replenish the substrate. After start up (approx. 2 months), the reactor was refilled with the synthetic wastewater. Chlorella vulgaris was then added to give the desired concentration according to the following experiments (PFC mode). The PFC reactor was closed with a rubber stop (no aeration supply), and operated at batch mode throughout the following tests. Illumination (200 μmol s−1m−2 on the top of water surface) was achieved via full spectrum light bulbs, which were controlled by a timer to adjust the light/dark photoperiod. The dark condition was created by placing the PFC reactor in a dark room and packed with aluminium foil. Except for different photoperiod test, the illumination time was 24 hours per day. The cell voltage across a 1000 ohm resistor was recorded with 10 min interval by a digital multimeter (Model 2700, Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA). For different COD/N experiments, the acetate concentration was first fixed at about 147.8 mg COD L−1, while the NH4+–N concentration in the synthetic wastewater was changed to 30.1, 53.4, and 89.0 mg L−1, resulting in COD/N of 5.0, 2.9, and 1.7 g g−1, respectively. Besides, acetate and NH4+–N were also changed to 738.8 mg L−1 and 53.8 mg L−1, respectively, resulting in a COD/N of 13.7 g g−1. Another two reactors were set up for control experiments. All experiments were carried out in duplicate at room temperature (22 ± 3 °C).

2.3 Analytical methods and calculations
Current (I), power (P = IV), and Coulombic efficiency (CE) were calculated as previously described, with the power density normalized by the projected surface area of the anode.14 Chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solid (TSS), nitrogen species and P–PO43− were measured according to the standard method (APHA, 1999). To measure these parameters in the solutions, the sample was centrifuged (13000 × g) before analysis to remove solids; while measuring the total N (or P) in the biomass, the sample was digested before analysis (APHA, 1999). N2 and CO2 in the headspace were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (MicroLab, Arhus, Denmark) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Acetate was measured by gas chromatography with FID detection (Agilent, 6890) as previously described.27 pH was measured with a PHM 210 pH meter (Radiometer). Dissolved oxygen (DO) was measured using a DO meter (Microprocessor oximeter 539, Germany). OD was measured by a spectrophotometer (Spectronic 20D+, Thermo Scientific). Light intensity was measured by a photometer (model L1-189, L1-COR, USA).
2.4 Microbial community analysis
Biomass and water samples were collected from different parts of the PFC. Total DNA extraction, PCR-DGGE and 16S rDNA analysis were done as described previously.27Nucleotide sequences have been deposited in the GenBank database and are available under accession numbers JF979184–JF979197.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Power and algae biomass production
An example of one cycle of power generation and algae biomass production is shown in Fig. 2a. With an initial algae concentration of 3.5 g L−1, a stable power density of 68 ± 5 mW m−2 (0.25 V) was generated and kept for the following 80 h (Fig. 2a). Along with electricity, algae biomass concentration at the end of operation increased to 4.06 g L−1. The average biomass production rate was 0.14 g L−1d−1. No electricity generation was observed in the reactor without Chlorella vulgaris addition (control 1), which might be due to the insufficient electron acceptor (oxygen) without algae photosynthesis. Similarly, no appreciable algae biomass generation was observed during open circuit operation (control 2), which could be due to the insufficiency of inorganic matter (CO2) for algae photosynthesis, as the organic matter degradation rate was much slower under open circuit operation in MFCs.5 The above results indicated that both algae photosynthesis and exoelectrogenesis were an integral part of the PFC.

3.2 Organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus removal in the PFC
The carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus removal during electricity generation was investigated. Only 0.8 mg L−1 of acetate was detected at the end of operation, resulting in a removal efficiency of 99.6% (Fig. 2b). Similarly, NH4+–N decreased gradually from initial 55.6 ± 0.1 to 6.6 ± 0.1 mg L−1 (Fig. 2c). Meanwhile, 7.8 ± 0.1 mg L−1 of NO3−–N and 3.4 ± 0.1 mg L−1 of NO2−–N were detected at 72 h and 48 h, respectively. But they were both removed afterwards, resulting in 87.6% total nitrogen removal at the end of batch run (Fig. 2c). The phosphorus removal efficiency was relatively lower and about 70% of PO43−–P was removed along with electricity generation (Fig. 2d). Much lower acetate (max. 38%), NH4+–N (max. 16%) and PO43−–P (max. 18%) removals were observed in the control reactors without algae addition (control 1) or under open circuit operation (control 2) (Fig. 2b–d).
A mass balance among COD, nitrogen and phosphorus was established for elucidating the removal mechanisms. As shown in Table 1, most of the COD (138.5 mg COD L−1) in the influent was oxidized and finally captured into biomass at the end of electricity generation. No CO2 was observed in the headspace, showing that all the CO2 from substrate degradation was completely utilized by algae. In addition, methane and hydrogen were not detected in the headspace, indicating methanogenesis and hydrogen production had been effectively inhibited in the system.28

Based on the nitrogen balance, more than 75% of removed nitrogen (36.4 ± 0.1 mg N L−1) was assimilated into algae biomass. It was also noticed that nearly 22% of removed nitrogen (10.5 ± 0.1 mg L−1) was in the form of N2, which could be due to nitrification–denitrification taking place in the sediment or cathode.17,18 Dissolved oxygen in the reactor was lower than 7.0 mg L−1 (Fig. S2, ESI†), at which nitrification and limited electrochemical denitrification in the MFC cathode was observed in a previous study.19 Identification of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in the reactor (discussed later) confirmed the above hypothesis. N2O was not measured but based on the nitrogen mass balance, it was less than 3.2% of total N (1.8 ± 0.5 mg L−1). N2O is a strong greenhouse gas, which accounts for 29.2% of total nitrogen removal during electrochemical denitrification in the two-chamber MFC,19 and even as the main product over N2 in the conventional denitrification process.29 The reduction of N2O in the PFC in this study was due to the direct uptake of most of the nitrogen by algae biomass, thereby the conventional nitrogen reduction process (NO3− → NO2− → N2O → N2) becoming less dominant. Similarly, more than 93% of removed PO43−–P (6.9 ± 0.1 mg L−1) was assimilated into the algae biomass (Table 1). The contribution of abiotic phosphorus precipitation can be negligible due to the relatively low pH (<7.5, Fig. S2, ESI†) throughout the PFC operation.22 The above results indicated that the algae biomass uptake was the main removal mechanism of nitrogen and phosphorus in the PFC.
3.3 Performance of the PFC with different algae concentrations
The PFC was further tested with different algae concentrations. The results are presented in Table 2. Power production increased with the algae concentration and reached to a maximum of 98 ± 1 mW m−2 at 18 g L−1 algae, which could be due to the increased oxygen supply by algae. The algae biomass production was not further improved when the initial algae concentration was higher than 7.1 g L−1, indicating that other parameters (e.g., illumination intensity, nutrients concentration) might take over to determine the algae growth rate.

The removal of carbon and nutrients was variable at different initial algae concentrations (Table 2). More than 99% of acetate was removed in all tested algae concentrations. In contrast, only 66.2% of total nitrogen was removed at an algae concentration of 1.8 g L−1, and then it increased to 91.6% at 14.4 g L−1. However, the removal efficiency was slightly decreased to 86.1%, when 18 g L−1 algae was applied, which was due to the accumulation of NO3−–N (5.8 mg L−1) (Table 2). The increased DO might lead to higher NO3−–N accumulation, while algae utilization of N–NO3− was a relatively slower process, which requires nitrate reductase and ATP.30 A significant increase of phosphorus removal with the algae concentration was observed, indicating the improved phosphorus uptake at high algae concentration.
3.4 Performance of the PFC at different COD/N ratios

Table 3 summarizes the results of the tests with different COD/N ratios. No significant differences among power generations were observed at COD/N ratios ranging from 1.7 to 5.0 g g−1, which could be due to the same COD concentration (147.8–150.8 mg L−1) applied. However, a higher power (94 mW m−2) was observed when a higher COD concentration (738.8 mg L−1) was supplied at a COD/N ratio of 13.7 g g−1, indicating that power generation was mainly dependent on the substrate concentration and not the COD/N ratio. No appreciable electricity generation was observed without substrate supply. The carbon and nutrients removal efficiency varied according to different COD/N ratios. Acetate was nearly removed (≥99%) at all tested COD/N ratios. Unlike carbon, the nitrogen removal increased with the COD/N ratio, and the maximum removal efficiency of 93.4% was achieved at a COD/N ratio of 13.7 g g−1. However, a decrease of phosphorus removal efficiency from 79.8 to 67.2% was observed when the COD/N ratio was increased from 1.7 to 5.0 g g−1 (the N level was 89.0 to 30.1 mg N L−1, respectively). It was probably due to the relatively lower nitrogen concentration at high COD/N ratios, which limited the phosphorus uptake capacity of algae.31 Interestingly, phosphorus removal (81%) was improved at a COD/N ratio of 13.7, where much higher COD concentration was applied compared with other COD/N ratios. More organic matter supply could lead to more CO2 release through bacterial oxidation, which might accelerate the algal photosynthesis, and thus, increased nutrients uptake. It was observed that more than 77.3% of nitrogen and 67.2% of phosphorus were removed even at a relatively low COD/N ratio of 1.7. Normally, a COD/N ratio over 7 g g−1 is typically required for a conventional (microbiological) nitrogen removal process.2 Therefore, the PFC has broad applicability for wastewaters containing various COD/N ratios.

3.5 Effects of light/dark cycles on the PFC performance
The influence of illumination on the PFC performance was investigated. With 10 h/14 h light/dark photoperiod, power generation increased when the light was on and decreased in the dark. However, the maximum stable power density of 61 ± 1 mW m−2 was always observed at the end of the light period (Fig. 3a). The similar phenomenon has also been observed in photosynthetic organism catalyzed sediment MFCs.24,32 It could be due to the gradual oxygen accumulation from algal photosynthesis during the light period. The biomass concentration was 4.03 ± 0.02 g L−1 at the end of operation, which was close to the value obtained under continuous illumination shown in Fig. 2a, but a relative longer time (approx. 140 hours) was required (Fig. 3b). Comparatively, no significant power and biomass generation was observed at a light/dark period of 0 h/24 h (Fig. 3a and b).
 Fig. 3  Effect of illumination on the performance of the PFC: (a) electricity generation; (b) biomass production; (c) acetate removal and (d) nitrogen and phosphorus removal. Initial algae concentration was 3.5 g L−1. Day/night mode: 10 h/14 h photoperiod; dark (all night) mode: 0 h/24 h photoperiod. L/D: light/dark mode; D: dark mode. 
With 10 h/14 h photoperiod, more than 99% of acetate was degraded (Fig. 3c). Meanwhile, NH4+–N was decreased from 54.1 to 5.9 mg L−1, resulting in a total nitrogen removal efficiency of 89% (Fig. 3d). Similarly, PO43−–P was gradually decreased from 10.2 to 3.8 mg L−1 (Fig. 3d). The only difference here, compared with continuous illumination, was the longer reaction time. No appreciable carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus removal was observed during the photoperiod of 0 h/24 h (total dark) (Fig. 3c and d), indicating the importance of illumination. Furthermore, the above results showed the applicability of the PFC in regions with year-round solar radiation, as the 10 h/14 h photoperiod is close to the natural sunlight condition.
3.6 Microbial community
Bacterial community profiles of the PFC were analyzed by DGGE (Fig. 4), and phylogenetic affiliations of the representative band sequences were shown as 16S rDNA genes library (Table S2, ESI†). The bacterial communities in the PFC showed to be notably different from the original inoculated sediment. Furthermore, the samples taken from different sites (anode in sediment, liquid and cathode) had different community compositions. On the cathode surface, bacteria belonging to uncultured Flavobacteria and Sphingobacteria (Fig. 4, bands 9 and 10, respectively) were detected as dominant species. The former one was isolated from a denitrifying bioreactor, while the latter was taking part in ammonia oxidation. Similarly, uncultured Flavobacteria were also detected in the middle-level water, which was otherwise, dominated by the bacteria similar to Terrimonas ferruginea sp. and Bradyrhizobium sp. In contrast, the bacterial community from the anode was dominated by iron reducing (band 13) and denitrifying bacteria (band 14), which belong to Alphaproteobacteria. Identification of ammonia oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria in the reactor verified thereby the previous hypothesis that the nitrogen gas was generated by a nitrification–denitrification process.

Numbers represented bands that were excised and sequenced for further analysis. 
The purity of algal species in the system was not analyzed, but it is reasonable to assume that Chlorella vulgaris was at least the dominant species because the artificial wastewater and algae were refilled at each batch.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the PFC system described in this paper was able to produce electricity and algal biomass, and remove/capture carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first comprehensive study of wastewater nutrients removal along with energy generation through the symbiotic interaction between electrochemically active bacteria and microalgae. Employment of the closed system in this study was able to easily track the fate of C, N, and P, which was helpful for better understanding of the wastewater removal mechanism. This work serves as a state-of-the-art study about integration of MFCs with algae technology for wastewater treatment. Further implementation of this concept with an open system may promote its practical application. Future studies for development of economical and efficient algae harvesting technologies are necessary in order to further use the produced algae biomass for bioenergy production.

Broader context
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a promising technology for simultaneous wastewater treatment and electric energy production. Anodic conversion of organic carbon into electricity is a relatively easy process in MFCs. However, nitrogen removal in MFCs is still too expensive since costly membranes and mechanical aeration are required. Moreover, there is still no report of phosphorus removal in MFCs. Fortunately, microalgae technology for wastewater nutrients treatment has been recently developed, providing a novel, efficient and cost-effective solution for nutrients removal in MFCs. Here, an innovative sediment-type photomicrobial fuel cell (PFC), based on the cooperation between microalgae and electrochemically active bacteria, has been reported. Under illumination, a stable power density of 68 ± 5 mW m−2 and a biomass of 0.56 ± 0.02 g L−1 were generated at an initial algae concentration of 3.5 g L−1. Accordingly, the removal efficiency of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus was 99.6%, 87.6% and 69.8%, respectively. The performance was further improved by optimization of the algae concentration and C/N ratio. This demonstrates that the PFC system offers a straightforward, effective and cost-effective route to remove C, N, P and recover energy and biomass simultaneously, opening an entirely and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment concept.
