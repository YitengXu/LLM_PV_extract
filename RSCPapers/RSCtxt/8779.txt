    , Accepted 10th September 2018First published on 21st September 2018AbstractThe present article presents an in-depth discussion on the state-of-the-art multifarious roles of Au nanoparticles and their associated charge anti-recombination process in burgeoning photocatalysis research. Hexagonal-phase ZnTiO3 was fabricated through a sol–gel auto-combustion method by optimizing the calcination temperatures. To further improve the charge separation efficiency and visible light induced photocatalytic activity of pristine ZnTiO3, we designed a new type of Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite by a precipitation–deposition method. The photocatalytic activities of the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites were substantiated by evaluating the rate of hydrogen evolution under both UV and visible light illumination. The photocatalytic activity of the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites rises proportionally with an increase in Au content up to 1.5 wt% under UV light illumination and it produce around 285 μmol h−1 of H2 which is approximately 2.6 times higher than that produced by pristine ZnTiO3. Therefore, the Au nanoparticles present on the surface of ZnTiO3 act as electron acceptors, leading to an increase in the rate of generation and separation of charge carriers. This process helps to enhance the congregation of electrons on Au nanoparticles through the Schottky junction. The obtained results are very consistent with steady-state PL and UV light induced photocurrent measurements. Conversely, such a trend was not detected under visible light illumination. The visible light induced photocatalytic activity of Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites increases with a rise in Au content up to 1 wt% and thereafter decreases with further Au loading. Therefore, the initial increment in photocatalytic activity is due to the generation, separation and participation of a large number of SPR-induced charge carriers and thereafter decreases due to the recombination of SPR-generated charge carriers because of the formation of defect sites at the Au and ZnTiO3 interface. That the excess Au loading causes the recombination of SPR charge carriers was well explained by undertaking SPR-induced TRPL analysis and this result is directly followed up with the results of visible light induced photocurrent and EIS measurements. The Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites with optimal Au loading (1 wt%) delivered an amazingly high rate of hydrogen evolution i.e. 108 μmol h−1 with an energy conversion efficiency of 7.14%, whereas pristine ZnTiO3 shows negligible activity under visible light illumination.
Introduction
ZnTiO3 with its perovskite type oxide structure is an attractive material which could be used for many applications, such as microwave resonators, gas sensors (for ethanol, NO, CO, etc.), microelectronics, metal–air barriers, non-linear optics and photocatalysis.1–3 However, there exist two kinds of crystal structure of perovskite-type ZnTiO3: (i) cubic and (ii) hexagonal structures of ZnTiO3. Between these two crystal structures, hexagonal ZnTiO3 is a well-known potential photocatalyst for photocatalytic reactions.4 However, the synthesis of pure hexagonal ZnTiO3 is not so easy; fabrication by the conventional solid-state reaction method has lots of demerits, such as the required high temperature for the formation; very large particle size and chemical heterogeneity.5,6 After putting in hard effort and with a major focus on the synthesis procedure, some researchers have successfully synthesized hexagonal ZnTiO3 by using the solid-state reaction method and other low-temperature methods, such as sol–gel, molten salt, modified alcoholysis and carbothermal methods.4,5,7–9 Yet, there have been limited reports on the preparation of pure hexagonal ZnTiO3 and its photocatalytic applications. Here, we have successfully synthesized hexagonal ZnTiO3 by a sol–gel auto-combustion method and tested its activity towards the hydrogen production reaction. This fabrication method of ZnTiO3 has neither been reported before nor has this material been tested for hydrogen production.
However, ZnTiO3 is a UV light active photocatalyst with a band gap energy of 3.08 eV, which accounts for only 4% of the total solar spectrum. To further improve the charge separation efficiency and visible light induced photocatalytic activity of pristine ZnTiO3, the amalgamation of a ZnTiO3 semiconductor with plasmonic metals is considered a superior tactic. This is because the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) characteristics of a metal are able to enhance light absorption and participate in visible light assisted photocatalytic reactions.10,11 Among all the plasmonic metals, gold is considered to be a striking metal for the invention of metal–semiconductor nanocomposites because of its various exciting properties, like the electron storage effect, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) characteristics, high catalytic activity, optical sensitivity and high chemical stability.12 Recently, a large number of articles have been published on Au/TiO2 systems to improve the visible light assisted photocatalytic performance of pristine TiO2.13–15 Therefore, we deposited Au nanoparticles onto a ZnTiO3 surface to enhance the visible light responsiveness of ZnTiO3 and also to reduce the electron–hole recombination rate by injecting SPR-induced electrons into the ZnTiO3 surface.
In this article, we have prepared ZnTiO3 by a sol–gel auto combustion method and loaded Au nanoparticles onto the surface of ZnTiO3 through a precipitation–deposition method. The photocatalytic properties of the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites were demonstrated by evaluating the rate of hydrogen generation under both UV and visible light irradiation. Different trends were found for the rate of hydrogen evolution over Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites under UV and visible light. The photocatalytic activity of Au/ZnTiO3 increased with a rise in the Au content to 1.5 wt% under UV light illumination. The increased photocatalytic activity with an increase in the Au loading is due to the separation of charge carriers at the interface formed between ZnTiO3 and Au nanoparticles through the Schottky barrier and this was well explained by steady-state PL and UV light induced photocurrent measurements. In contrast, the highest visible light induced photocatalytic activity was observed with optimal Au loading, i.e. 1 wt%, and then the activity decreased with further Au loading. The reason for getting higher photocatalytic activity upon optimum gold loading under visible light illumination is explained in the following section by undertaking SPR-induced TRPL, photocurrent and EIS spectroscopy.
Experimental
Materials
The chemical used were zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Merck), titanium oxy-sulfate sulfuric acid complex hydrate (TiO-SO4·xH2SO4·xH2O, Sigma-Aldrich), citric acid monohydrate (C6H8O7·H2O, Merck), ammonia solution (25% NH3, Merck), urea crystals (CO (NH2)2, Merck) and hydrogen tetra-chloroaurate(III) trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O, Aldrich). All the chemicals were obtained as analytical grade reagents and used without further purification.
Fabrication of ZnTiO3 by sol–gel auto-combustion method
Purified Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, TiO-SO4·xH2SO4·xH2O, C6H8O7·H2O and NH4OH were used as raw materials to prepare ZnTiO3. According to the stoichiometric composition, a specified amount, i.e. 0.01 mole, of TiO-SO4·xH2SO4·xH2O (Sigma-Aldrich only) was slowly added to 150 mL of distilled water and kept under continuous stirring for 4 h for complete dissolution. On the other hand, 0.01 mole of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) was also dissolved in 150 mL of distilled water. Then the two solutions were mixed and stirred for another 1 h to form a homogeneous solution. Citric acid (C6H8O7·H2O) was used as a fuel and added to the above mixed solution. The molar amount of citric acid was equal to the total molar amount of metal ions in solution (i.e. Zn:Ti:C6H8O7·H2O = 1:1:2) and stirred for 1 h to get a colourless homogeneous solution. After that, ammonium hydroxide was slowly added to adjust the pH 7.0 and also to stabilize the sol. After mixing, the obtained transparent solutions were slowly evaporated by heating at 75–80 °C under continuous stirring using a magnetic stirrer for several hours. Later, the stabilized sol was heated slowly to 130 °C. Changes in viscosity and colour were observed as the sol turned into a dark green, puffy, porous dry gel, which on further heating was automatically ignited in a self-propagating combustion manner and a large amount of brown fumes evolved. Finally, a voluminous porous powder was obtained and the powder was activated at different temperatures in air from 500 to 900 °C for 2 h.
Fabrication of Au deposited ZnTiO3 by a deposition–precipitation method
Au nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of ZnTiO3 by a deposition–precipitation method.16 One gm of ZnTiO3 powder was added into 100 ml of aqueous solution containing 0.42 M of urea and a certain amount of HAuCl4. The amount of HAuCl4 was calculated according to the designed loading amount of gold (i.e. 0.5–1.5 wt%) in the ZnTiO3. It was proposed that urea (CO(NH2)2) could react with water and gently produce hydroxide ions (OH−) and the progressive decomposition of urea in solution at a temperature above 60 °C would release OH− ions, which would gradually increase the pH value. This method makes possible the slow precipitation of hydroxides onto the support, and avoids a brutal and local increase in pH, which could induce precipitation in the solution. Therefore, the gold hydroxide could be homogeneously and equably precipitated. Afterwards, the suspension was thermostatted at 80 °C for 4 h under vigorous stirring. Then the suspension was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes, washed with deionized water, and centrifuged again. The washing and centrifuging procedures were repeated four times in order to remove residual Cl− thoroughly. The yellow sediment was dried in air at 100 °C overnight, resulting in the “as-prepared” samples. The final catalyst was obtained after activation under air at 400 °C for 4 h. This calcination treatment leads to the reduction of adsorbed Au(III) complexes into gold nanoparticles.17 These sequences of preparation in solution were performed in the dark, since light is known to decompose the gold precursors and to reduce them. The neat Au nanoparticles were prepared in a similar manner without including ZnTiO3 powder.
Methods of characterization
The samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction pattern (PXRD), BET-surface area, diffuse reflectance UV-vis (DRUV-vis), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL spectra), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and photocurrent measurement. The PXRD pattern was conducted on a RINT-Ultima III, Rigaku diffractometer with automatic control. The patterns were run with monochromatic CuKα radiation from 2θ = 10° to 80° with a scan rate of 2° min−1. N2 adsorption–desorption studies were performed at liquid nitrogen temperature (−197 °C) in an automated surface area and porosity analyser (ASAP 2020, Micromeritics, USA). Prior to the analysis, the samples were degassed under vacuum (10−5 torr) at 200 °C for 4 h. FESEM images were taken on a Zeiss Supra 55. TEM was obtained on a Philips TECNAI G2 operated at 200 kV, in which the specimen was prepared by dispersing the powdered samples in 2-propanol, sonicating for 3 min and then drop-drying on a copper grid coated with carbon film. PL spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer (LS 55) spectrofluorimeter. The PL spectra were measured at room temperature under excitation at 300 nm provided by emission from a xenon lamp. Optical absorbance was measured by taking DRUV-vis spectra of the catalyst samples with a Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory in the region 200–800 nm, with boric acid as the reference. XPS measurements were performed on a VG Microtech Multilab ESCA 3000 spectrometer with a non-monochromatised MgKα X-ray source. The binding energy correction was performed using the C 1s peak of carbon at 284.9 eV as a reference. For photoelectrochemical measurement, the electrodes were prepared by electrophoretic deposition in an iodine solution containing 30 ml of acetone, 30 mg of photocatalyst powder and 30 mg of iodine. Two parallel FTO electrodes were immersed in the solution with a 10–15 mm separation, and a 60 V bias was applied between them for 2 min under potentiostat control. The coated area was fixed at 1 cm × 1.5 cm and then dried. The photoelectrochemical measurement was performed using a conventional pyrex electrochemical cell consisting of a prepared electrode, a platinum wire as a counter electrode (1 mm in diameter, 15 mm in length) and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The cell was filled with an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Na2SO4 and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 6. The electrolyte was saturated with nitrogen prior to electrochemical measurements and the potential of the electrode was controlled by a potentiostat (Versastat 3, Princeton Applied Research) with 300 W Xe lamps. It should be noted that the FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) did not show a photoresponse in the solution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using Versastat 3 (Princeton Applied Research) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 6) over a frequency range of 104 Hz to 0.01 Hz with an applied voltage of 20 mV. The Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted under visible light irradiation using a Newport 300 W Xe lamp with a cut-off wavelength λ ≥ 550 nm. The approximate average incident radiation power on the photocatalyst was measured by an Oriel Radiant Power Meter.
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution using aqueous methanol solution
The catalytic activity and deactivation were studied in a batch reactor. About 0.1 g of catalyst was suspended in 100 mL of an aqueous solution containing 10 vol% of CH3OH solution for H2 evolution. The solution was kept under stirring with a magnetic stirrer, prohibiting particles from settling at the bottom of the reactor. Prior to irradiation, the reaction mixture was purged with N2 in order to remove dissolved gases. A 125 W medium-pressure Hg lamp was used as a visible light source and 1 M NaNO2 solution was used as a UV filter. The evolved gas was collected by the water displacement technique and analyzed by GC-17A using a 5 Å molecular sieve column with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A comparison of the retention time of the peak that appeared on the chromatogram with standards confirmed that the evolved gas was hydrogen. For the UV light assisted photocatalytic hydrogen generation, we followed the same procedure as described above but used a 125 W high-pressure Hg lamp instead of the 125 W medium-pressure Hg lamp. A 125 W medium-pressure Hg lamp was used as the visible light source and 1 M NaNO2 solution was used as the UV filter. The approximate average incident radiation power on the photocatalyst and stored chemical energy of 1 wt% Au deposited ZnTiO3 under visible-light irradiation were calculated to be 120 and 8.57 mW, respectively. Therefore, the energy conversion efficiency of the photocatalyst was calculated by using eqn (1):18 (1)
The detailed procedure for the calculation of the stored chemical energy of 1 wt% Au deposited ZnTiO3 under visible-light irradiation is given in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
To determine the actual activation temperature for the formation of pure-phase and well-crystalline hexagonal ZnTiO3, the as-prepared powders obtained by the sol–gel auto-combustion method were treated at different temperatures (500–900 °C) for 2 h. The resulting XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S1.† The sample calcined at 500 °C exhibits the coexistence of both cubic and hexagonal ZnTiO3. By increasing the activation temperature from 500 to 700 °C, the hexagonal phase of ZnTiO3 was formed along with a very small amount of cubic ZnTiO3 impurity. Moreover, the sample activated at 700 °C also indicates the presence of sulfate ions on the surface of ZnTiO3, which was later confirmed by XPS (as shown in Fig. S2†). When the sample was activated at 800 °C, it exhibited the formation of hexagonal-phase ZnTiO3 (JCPDS file no. 14-0033). The sharp and intense nature of the ZnTiO3 peaks indicates that the prepared material is highly crystalline in nature. When the calcination temperature increased from 800 to 900 °C, the hexagonal-phase ZnTiO3 was decomposed into cubic spinel (Zn2TiO4) and rutile (TiO2). Since the hexagonal phase of ZnTiO3 was formed at 800 °C, it was used for further study.
The photocatalytic activity of neat ZnTiO3-800 °C was further improved with Au loading. The overall fabrication procedure of the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite is schematically outlined in Scheme 1. The Au nanoparticles are assembled on the surface of ZnTiO3 by a precipitation–deposition method. Based on the procedure, the synthesized ZnTiO3 powder was added into an aqueous solution containing urea and HAuCl4. During the process, the added urea acts as a precipitating agent which could react with water and gently produce hydroxide ions (OH−). Generally, the urea in the solution decomposes at a temperature above 60 °C and releases OH− ions, which slowly increases the pH of the medium. This probably causes the slow precipitation of hydroxides onto the support and avoids a brutal and local increase in pH, which could induce precipitation in solution.17 Therefore, the gold hydroxide could be homogeneously and equably precipitated. Afterwards, the suspension was thermostatted at 80 °C under vigorous stirring conditions and then centrifuged, washed and dried to obtain the “as-prepared” samples. Then, the “as-prepared” sample was calcined to reduce the adsorbed Au(III) complexes on the surface of ZnTiO3 into gold nanoparticles and the prepared samples were then named as Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites.18 The Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites were prepared by varying the weight percentage of Au from 0.5 to 1.5 wt% and the corresponding samples are assigned as 0.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3, 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 and 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites, respectively.
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram for the synthesis of Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites. 
The formation of Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites was confirmed by PXRD. The X-ray diffraction patterns of Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites with varying Au concentration (0.5–1.5 wt%) are represented in Fig. 1. At a lower concentration of gold loading (0.5 wt%), no significant diffraction peaks of the gold species are observed. This is because either the Au nanoparticles exist in a highly dispersed form in the ZnTiO3 host or the amount of Au is too small (0.5 wt%), i.e. beyond the detection limit of the XRD. In addition, when the amount of Au loading exceeds 0.5 wt%, pronounced peaks at 2θ = 38.2° started to appear, intensifying gradually with rising Au concentration, which implies that the crystallization of the deposited Au becomes better. The peak at 2θ = 38.2° is indexed to the (111) plane of the corresponding cubic phase of gold.19 Furthermore, the XRD investigations clearly confirm that the deposited Au nanoparticles are present in metallic form (Au0) in the respective Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites.20 The 2θ diffraction peaks of ZnTiO3 slightly blue shift to the lower angle region. The shift is achieved due to the electronic interaction between the ZnTiO3 and Au nanoparticles.21,22

The surface morphologies of the ZnTiO3 and Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites were examined by taking the FESEM characterization. Fig. 2(a–d) shows the FESEM images of the ZnTiO3 and Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites with varying Au concentration. A typical FESEM image (Fig. 2a) shows that the ZnTiO3 sample consists of irregular shaped particles with a size ranging from 100 to 200 nm. It is apparent that the ZnTiO3 samples possess irregularly shaped particles with a smooth surface. After deposition of Au nanoparticles on the ZnTiO3 surface, it was observed that the gold nanoparticles are well distributed on the surface and the edges of the ZnTiO3 particles. However, the size of the Au nanoparticles was not clearly detectable from the FESEM images and was later determined by TEM analysis.

In addition, the density of gold nanoparticles assembled on the surface of ZnTiO3 gradually increases with an increase in the Au concentration, which is consistent with the XRD results. Therefore, the Au nanoparticles are uniformly deposited on the surface of ZnTiO3 up to 1.5 wt%, which is beneficial for the photocatalytic reactions. This is because the uniform distribution of Au nanoparticles without any discernible aggregation on the ZnTiO3 surface leads to the formation of a better interface with the ZnTiO3 particles. Moreover, the surface of the ZnTiO3 was no longer smooth due to its decoration with numerous secondary Au nanoparticles.
More detailed microstructural, interface and elemental analysis of the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites was undertaken by TEM, HRTEM, SAED and EDAX. Fig. 3(a) shows a typical bright field TEM image of ZnTiO3 in the absence of Au nanoparticles. From the figure it can be observed that the sample consists of irregularly shaped particles with an average particle size of 100–200 nm which is matches well with the FESEM image. The better crystallinity of the products was confirmed by the HRTEM image. The HRTEM image (Fig. 3b) of a part of single particle shows several lattice planes with perfect crystallinity. The product with clear lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.271 nm is related to the (114) plane of the hexagonal ZnTiO3 crystal. The SEAD patterns in Fig. 3c clearly exhibit the polycrystalline nature of ZnTiO3. Furthermore, the ring patterns along with the bright spots in Fig. 3c are perfectly indexed to the (108), (114) and (300) planes of hexagonal ZnTiO3, respectively. Fig. 3d shows the EDAX pattern of pure ZnTiO3, which exhibits the existence of only Zn, Ti, and O elements in the sample.

The TEM images of the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites with varying Au content are shown in Fig. 4(a–c). After deposition of the Au nanoparticles on the surface of ZnTiO3, a large number of tiny dark spheroidal particles are assembled on the surface of the ZnTiO3 particles (Fig. 4(a–c)). These tiny dark spheroidal particles have an average particle size in the range of 5–10 nm. The Au nanoparticles are well attached to the ZnTiO3 particles, even after ultrasonication for 15 min to disperse the sample for TEM characterization. It is also clearly shown that the Au nanoparticles are well dispersed on ZnTiO3 without aggregation up to 1.5 wt%. The absence of isolated Au nanoparticles reveals that the link between ZnTiO3 and Au nanoparticles is very strong. Furthermore, no structural damage or dissolution of ZnTiO3 particles occurred after Au deposition. To obtain more internal structural information on the interface of ZnTiO3 and Au nanoparticles, an HRTEM image of the 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 interface was taken (Fig. 5(b)).

 Fig. 5  (a) TEM and (b) HRTEM images of 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite. 
The well-resolved periodic lattice fringe with an interplanar distance of 0.274 nm comes from the (114) plane of hexagonal ZnTiO3. Additionally, a semicircular nanoparticle on the surface of the ZnTiO3 can clearly be observed, with an interplanar spacing of 0.235 nm, which corresponds to the (111) lattice plane of cubic gold nanoparticles. In addition, the lattice fringes on the bottom of the semicircular shaped Au nanoparticles are strongly connected with the lattice fringes of the ZnTiO3 particle surface and hence a well-defined heterointerface is generated between the two, which is propitious for charge transfer between the two phases.23
The bright and dark field images of the 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). The bright particles in the image are assigned to the Au nanoparticles and the dark portion is ascribed to the ZnTiO3 particles.22 Therefore, the bright and dark field images further verify the presence of two types of crystals in the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite. The glowing Au nanoparticles are well distributed on the surface of the ZnTiO3 particles. The EDAX pattern reveals the presence of Zn, Ti, O and Au elements in the 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites, as shown in Fig. 6(c).

Photocatalytic reactions
Firstly, the SPR character of the Au nanoparticles in the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites was studied with UV-vis DRS spectroscopy. The absorbance spectra of pure ZnTiO3 and Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites with varying Au concentrations are presented in Fig. 7. From the figure, it can be observed that pure ZnTiO3 shows absorption in the UV region, i.e. around 402 nm. The addition of gold slightly affects the absorption edge of ZnTiO3 and an additional spectrum in the visible region is due to the surface plasmon absorption of the corresponding gold, which was observed with maxima around 550 nm. Moreover, the characteristic plasmon absorbance of the Au in an Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite indicates the presence of Au in zero state.24,25 The height of the surface plasmon band increases with an increase in the gold concentration. The optical bandgap energy of ZnTiO3 in the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite as a function of Au concentration is shown in Fig. 8. From the figure, it can be seen that ZnTiO3 shows a small tuneable bandgap energy in the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite compared to bare ZnTiO3. Furthermore, the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite makes an approximately 0.12–0.15 eV contribution to narrowing the band gap of ZnTiO3, which may be attributed to the combination of two parts giving rise to synergistic properties, which arise from electronic coupling between the two systems.20 The formation of an Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite was also confirmed by the change in colour, i.e. the white colour of ZnTiO3 changes to a purple colour after deposition of the Au nanoparticles and the colour becomes darker with an increase in the concentration of Au. The developed purple colour well supports the characteristic surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of gold.25,26 The coloration of the samples was attributed to reduction of Au(III) to Au(0).

Next, to investigate the credible role of Au-induced SPR charge pairs in visible light assisted photocatalytic activity, the rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction was studied by using Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites with gold concentration varying from 0.5 to 1.5 wt%. The rate of hydrogen production over Au-deposited photocatalysts follows the order: 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 > 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 > 0.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites, as shown in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Photocatalytic hydrogen production over Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 400 nm). 
Therefore, the rate of hydrogen evolution increases with an increase in the Au concentration from 0.5 to 1 wt% in the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites and thereafter decreases with a further increase in the Au concentration. The activity of 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites is obviously superior to that of the other nanocomposites. Therefore, the optimum amount of Au loading on ZnTiO3 was found to be 1 wt%, which exhibits a higher rate of hydrogen evolution than the 0.5 or 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites and it produces hydrogen at around 108 μmol h−1, which is approximately 2.7 and 1.6 times higher than 0.5 and 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites. The energy conversion efficiency of the 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite was found to be 7.14%. Furthermore, ZnTiO3 shows a negligible rate of hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. Therefore, the loaded gold content has a great influence on the rate of hydrogen evolution of Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites under visible light illumination. The trend diversity in the photocatalytic performances with Au loading coincides well with the photocurrent measurements. It is good to know that the photocatalytic reactions and photoelectrochemical process are directly related to each other according to the phenomenon of charge carriers. Moreover, according to photophysics investigation, it is well recognized that the photocurrent results afford clear authentication of the electron transfer process within metal–semiconductor composites.27 Therefore, photoelectrochemical measurements of the prepared Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites were carried out to understand the effect of Au-induced SPR charge pairs on the photocatalytic reactions under visible light irradiation. Fig. 10 displays a linear sweep voltammogram of Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites recorded under visible light irradiation using a cut-off wavelength λ ≥ 550 nm.

The photocurrent–potential curve shows that no significant photocurrent was generated from neat ZnTiO3 in the absence of Au nanoparticles under visible light irradiation. However, after deposition of Au nanoparticles on the surface of ZnTiO3, a clear increase in anodic photocurrent with applied potential was observed in the potential range from −0.6 to +0.6 V in all the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites. The obvious visible-light excited anodic photocurrents mainly arise from the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the Au nanoparticles, which enhances the visible-light absorption and charge separation efficiency of wide-band-gap ZnTiO3via SPR-induced electron transfer. Moreover, that the generated anodic photocurrent is only due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Au nanoparticles was again confirmed from the excitation of SPR electrons with a band gap energy of 2.25 eV (λ ≥ 550 nm) which is less than the band gap energy of ZnTiO3, i.e. 3.08 eV.28–30 The observed anodic photocurrents for 0.5 wt%, 1 wt% and 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 are 14.8, 32.6 and 22 μA cm−2, respectively. However, both the photocatalytic activity and the photocurrent were improved with a rise in Au content up to 1 wt%, thereafter decreasing with further loading, indicating that the optimum amount of Au nanoparticle deposition on the ZnTiO3 surface shows maximum photocatalytic performance. To provide further evidence in support of the photocurrent being associated with the SPR-excited electron transfer from Au to ZnTiO3, wavelength dependence photocurrent measurements were carried out over a 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite using different cut-off filters (Fig. 11). The highest photocurrent was achieved at 550 nm over 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 and this result coincides well with the SPR absorption spectra of 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3. Therefore, these observations determine that the SPR-induced electrons are easily transferred from the Au nanoparticles to the ZnTiO3 surface and participate in the photocatalytic reactions.31

In order to discern the exact reason behind obtaining lower photocatalytic activity after optimum Au loading on the surface of ZnTiO3 under visible light, it is very important to know the direction of flow of electrons in the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites under UV light assisted photocatalytic reactions. Therefore, the photocatalytic activities of the synthesized nanocomposites were evaluated by testing the rate of hydrogen evolution under UV light as a function of Au loading and comparing the obtained results with the visible light induced photocatalytic activities. The rate of hydrogen evolution of all the synthesized nanocomposites was evaluated in the presence of a sacrificial reagent. Fig. 12 shows the rate of hydrogen generation on the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites loaded with different contents of gold. For a comparison study, the unloaded ZnTiO3 is taken as the reference. As can be seen from this figure, all the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites exhibit higher photocatalytic activity than pure ZnTiO3 under UV light irradiation. Pure ZnTiO3 produces a low amount of hydrogen, i.e. 110 μmol h−1, mainly due to the rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers in the single semiconductor. On the other hand, neat Au nanoparticles did not show any hydrogen production activity under UV light. Surprisingly, the deposition of a small amount of Au nanoparticles (0.5 wt%) on the surface of ZnTiO3 significantly enhanced the activity to twice that of the neat sample, i.e. 220 μmol h−1. The rate of hydrogen generation increases with an increase in the gold concentration up to 1.5 wt%. It produces hydrogen at around 285 μmol h−1, which is approximately 2.6 times higher than bulk ZnTiO3. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity of Au/ZnTiO3 increased with a rise in the Au content up to 1.5 wt%. The increased photocatalytic activity with a rise in the Au content is only possible due to the easy separation and migration of electrons to the Au surface through the formation of a Schottky junction at the Au/ZnTiO3 interface.11

Therefore, under UV light irradiation, the electrons in the conduction band of ZnTiO3 are easily transferred to the metallic Au nanoparticle through an interface and this was again confirmed by the XPS measurements. The chemical composition, valence state of the elements and the electronic interaction between Au and ZnTiO3 in the nanocomposites are further investigated by XPS spectra. Fig. 13 shows the XPS spectra of ZnTiO3 and the 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite. The binding energies of the individual atoms were internally determined by referencing adventitious carbon at a binding energy of 284.9 eV. The high-resolution XPS spectra of the Zn, Ti, and O elements in ZnTiO3 are shown in Fig. 13. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ti 2p is presented in Fig. 13(a). The spectrum reveal bimodal peaks which correspond to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 with binding energies of around 458.1 eV and 463.8 eV, which are in good agreement with the +4 oxidation state of titanium.32Fig. 13(b) shows the prominent splitting of the Zn 2p spectrum into two peaks. The peak centered at 1021.1 eV was attributed to the Zn 2p3/2 and the other peak at 1044.1 eV is due to Zn 2p1/2, indicating the +2 oxidation state of Zn in ZnTiO3.33 The high-resolution XPS spectrum of oxygen is shown in Fig. 13(d). The asymmetric shape of the O 1s spectrum indicates the presence of two types of oxygen environment. Accordingly, the O 1s spectrum was further deconvoluted into the two peaks shown in Fig. S4.† The lower binding energy peak at 529.6 eV is related to the Zn–O and Ti–O bonds in ZnTiO3, whereas another peak at 531 eV is attributed to the corresponding O–H bonds of surface-adsorbed water.21 Moreover, ZnTiO3 calcined at 800 °C shows the absence of sulfur ions whereas it shows the presence of sulfur ions in the XPS spectra when it was calcined at 700 °C. Fig. S2† shows the XPS spectrum of S 2p. The S 2p peak in ZnTiO3 obtained at 700 °C showed only one peak with a binding energy of 169.8 eV. The peak at 169.8 eV is deconvoluted into two peaks centered at 169.1 eV and 170.7 eV, respectively. The peak centered at 169.1 eV arises from the substitution of an S4+ cation for a Ti4+ cation. A peak at 170.7 eV is assigned to SO42− ions adsorbed on the surface of the sample.34 The S 2p peak in ZnTiO3 was observed due to the use of TiO-SO4·xH2SO4·xH2O reagent as a titanium source. As the calcination temperature is increased to 800 °C, the prepared ZnTiO3 shows an absence of S 2p in the XPS spectra, as shown in Fig. S3.† This is because at 800 °C, the sulfate species in the network of ZnTiO3 are expelled. Therefore, the results confirmed that ZnTiO3 prepared at 800 °C was actually composed of Zn, Ti and O elements. To further determine the oxidation state of gold in the 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite and to show that the formed Au nanoparticles have a strong interaction with neat ZnTiO3, XPS measurements were employed to analyze the samples after deposition of the gold nanoparticles on the surface of ZnTiO3. The binding energies of Au 4f7/2 at 83.4 eV and Au 4f5/2 at 86.9 eV (Fig. 13(c)) show that the Au species occur in the metallic state on the surface of ZnTiO3.31 However, the binding energies of Zn, Ti and O in 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 are positively shifted in comparison to ZnTiO3. This approximately 0.6 eV positive shift indicates a lower electron density of the ZnTiO3 in the 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite. Meanwhile, there is a negative shift (0.6 eV) in the binding energy of Au in comparison to bare gold (normally at 84.0 eV).31 The reverse shift in the binding energies of Au 3d and Zn, Ti, O in the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite suggests that the metallic Au and ZnTiO3 have a strong interaction in the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites. Generally, the strong interaction between the metal and support controls the electronic properties of the deposited gold nanoparticles and probably causes the negative shift in binding energy of the gold nanoparticles. The interaction between the metallic Au and ZnTiO3 in the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites can effectively inhibit the recombination of excited electrons and holes, because the Au particles on the surface of ZnTiO3 will act as electron acceptors and favour the separation of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the separation of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs in the nanocomposites is attributed to the transfer of conduction band electrons of ZnTiO3 to the Au nanoparticles and is only possible due to the strong interaction between the Au and ZnTiO3 particles.35,36

Therefore, the accumulation of electrons in the Au nanoparticles shifts the Fermi level of Au closer to the conduction band of ZnTiO3 until the two components reach equilibrium, resulting in a more negative potential of the Fermi level of the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites and hence reducing the coupling between electron–hole pairs and enhancing the activity.37 Furthermore, the electrons on the Au nanoparticles reduce the H+ ions to H2 and the holes in the VB of ZnTiO3 oxidize aqueous methanol into oxidizing products (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  Charge transfer mechanism on photocatalytic hydrogen production of Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites under UV light irradiation. 
The electron separation and accepting performances of Au nanoparticles under UV were again explained by taking the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra and photocurrent measurements of Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites. Fig. 14 reveals the room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pure ZnTiO3 and Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites prepared with different contents of Au, with an excitation wavelength of 300 nm. ZnTiO3 possesses one strong photoluminescence band centered at 401 nm and this emission band is related to band-to-band transitions because the peak position at 401 nm is nearly equal to the band gap of ZnTiO3, i.e. 3.08 (402 nm) eV. Three other weak emission peaks at 422 nm, 440 nm and 465 nm are not related to band-to-band transitions because the peak positions at (422 nm, 2.93 eV), (440 nm, 2.81 eV) and (465 nm, 2.66 eV) are smaller than the optical band gap of hexagonal ZnTiO3 (i.e. 3.08 eV) and these emissions arise from defects.38,39 After deposition of different contents of gold on the surface of ZnTiO3, the PL intensity of the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites varies and the minimum intensity is observed for the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite prepared with 1.5 wt%.
 Fig. 14  Photoluminescence emission spectra of (a) ZnTiO3, (b) 0.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3, (c) 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 and (d) 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3. 
This phenomenon demonstrates that with an increase in Au content from 0.5 to 1.5 wt%, more metal sites are formed which easily accept electrons, resulting in an increase in the separation efficiency of the photoinduced electron–hole pairs and thus the intensity of PL emission is significantly lowered.40 The emission intensity of 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 was found to be reduced by 91.6% compared to the emission intensity of ZnTiO3. Such a result illustrates that the Au nanoparticles on the ZnTiO3 surface block the defect-related charge carrier recombination pathways and enhance the photocatalytic activity. The PL emission of ZnTiO3 has been observed to be drastically quenched in the presence of AuNPs, showing their strong influence on the charge carrier recombination factor.41 The PL intensity gradually decreases with an increase in Au loading, which indicates that the radiative recombination process of the system is strongly hindered. Among all the photocatalysts, the 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 presents the most depressed signal. The PL result well supports the photocurrent results measured at λ ≥ 300 nm. Therefore, photoelectrochemical measurements of the prepared ZnTiO3 and Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites were carried out to understand the effect of Au deposition on ZnTiO3 particles in the charge anti-recombination process under UV light irradiation. Fig. 15 shows the photocurrent density vs. applied potential (I–V) curves for bare ZnTiO3 and Au/ZnTiO3 electrodes measured under UV light. Upon illumination with a xenon light source using a 300 nm cut-off, ZnTiO3 showed a very small amount of photocurrent. The photocurrent starts to be generated at ∼−0.8 V and continues to increase in a more anodic direction to +11.3 μA cm−2 at +0.9 V. The photocurrent further increases with an increase in Au loading up to 1.5 wt% on the surface of ZnTiO3. In comparison to bulk ZnTiO3, 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites showed a greater enhancement in the photocurrent density, i.e. +233.1 μA cm−2 at +0.9 V under UV light irradiation, in comparison to the other nanocomposites. Significantly, the photocurrent of 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites is almost ∼21 times higher than that of bare ZnTiO3. The ZnTiO3 nanoparticles alone do not noticeably increase the photocurrent due to the presence of more defects in the material, and the photocurrent for the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites is much higher than the photocurrent of ZnTiO3, which is only due to the synergistic effect between Au and ZnTiO3 particles resulting in the separation and accumulation of electrons on the Au nanoparticles through the Schottky junction. The proposed electron-accepting role of Au NPs, the variation trend of PL emission with SPR photoabsorption of Au nanoparticles and the proportionally increased photocurrent with an increase in Au content indicate the participation of SPR charge pairs in the visible light induced photocatalytic activity.

On the other hand, time-resolved PL spectroscopy was undertaken to understand the recombination of Au-induced SPR-excited electrons in the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites under visible light irradiation. Fig. 16 shows the TRPL decay curves of 0.5, 1 and 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites measured at 500 nm using a 445 nm laser as the excitation source.

From Fig. 16, it can be observed that the intensity of TRPL decay curves declined with an increase in Au loading. This shows that higher Au loading obstructs the radiative recombination of SPR charge pairs in Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites. The TRPL decay curve for each sample was well fitted by a tri-exponential function and shows that three different decay lifetimes, τ1, τ2 and τ3, participate in each decay curve of the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites. The three decay lifetimes values, i.e. τ1, τ2 and τ3, of all the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites are presented in Table 1. From the table it can be observed that the first two decay lifetimes (τ1 and τ2) arise from the rapid recombination of charge pairs and τ3 with its longer lifetime is associated with the diffusion of SPR-induced electrons to the active surface site. The first two decay lifetimes τ1 and τ2 did not follow any clear trend, whereas the third decay longer lifetime τ3 decreases with a rise in the Au content. This indicates that when more gold nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of ZnTiO3, the radiative recombination of long-lived SPR charge pairs is speeded up. The recombination sites are due to the defect sites created in the interfacial region of Au nanoparticles and the ZnTiO3 surface. The increased recombination assisted by the interfacial defect sites in the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite reduced the photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation. Hence, that the SPR-induced photocatalytic performance of Au/ZnTiO3 is reduced with an increase in Au content is due to increased interfacial defect sites, which speed up the recombination of SPR charge pairs and hinder the diffusion of SPR-induced electrons into the active ZnTiO3 surface.11

The TRPL result is consistent with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to probe the effect of Au loading on the charge separation and transformation of SPR-induced charge carriers through the interface of Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites under visible light irradiation. The typical EIS Nyquist plots of the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites measured under visible light irradiation (Xe lamp, λ ≥ 550 nm) are shown in Fig. 17. The Nyquist plot shows two frequency-related regions: (i) a semicircle in the high-frequency region and (ii) a sloping straight line in the low-frequency region. The semicircle in the high-frequency region mainly arises from the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), showing charge transfer through the electrode/electrolyte interface, while the sloping straight line in the low-frequency region is associated with mass transfer.42 Generally, the electron-transfer properties of the samples are reflected by the radius of the semicircle and the smaller the radius of the semicircle, the faster the rate of electron–hole separation and transfer.43 In the case of the 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite, the semicircle was observed to be much smaller in radius compared with that of other Au/ZnTiO3 electrodes, indicating that the SPR-induced electrons on Au are more easily separated and transferred to the ZnTiO3 surface through the interface. Moreover, the radius of the semicircle again increases with a rise in the gold content to 1.5 wt%. This is mainly due to the high interfacial charge-transfer resistance and poor electrical conductivity of the materials.21 The poor electrical conductivity mainly arises due to the formation of interfacial defects in Au/ZnTiO3 which obstruct the SPR electron transfer and increase the recombination effect. Therefore, we conclude that the increased and decreased photocatalytic activity can be caused by the following: due to the demands of SPR-induced electron transfer, our photocatalytic activity first increases due to the generation and participation of more electrons in the Au nanoparticles and then decreases with a further increase in Au content because the higher loading may cause the recombination of SPR charge pairs in the Au nanoparticles.
 Fig. 17  EIS spectra of (a) 0.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3, (b) 1 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 and (c) 1.5 wt% Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites were measured under visible light irradiation (Xe lamp, λ ≥ 550 nm). 
The mechanism of an Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposite under visible light is explained as being similar to dye sensitization.44 Under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 550 nm, hν ∼ 2.25 eV), the Au nanoparticles in the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites absorb visible light and the electrons near the Fermi level (+0.94 eV vs. NHE) are excited to the SPR state. As a result, the energy level of the of Au-induced SPR state is now located at about −1.31 eV vs. NHE. Hence the conduction band position of the ZnTiO3 (−0.14 eV vs. NHE) lies less negative than the SPR state of Au nanoparticles. Therefore, the photoexcited SPR electrons easily migrate to the conduction band of ZnTiO3. Thus, the electrons in the conduction band of ZnTiO3 are able to reduce the H+ ions to H2 (Scheme 3).45 The higher the separation of electron–hole pairs, the lower the rate of electron–hole recombination, so the more electron–hole pairs participate in the reaction and enhance the activity.46,47

Conclusions
In summary, hexagonal ZnTiO3 was prepared for the first time by using a sol–gel auto-combustion method and then the photocatalytic activity of ZnTiO3 was improved under visible light by loading with Au nanoparticles through a precipitation–deposition method. We demonstrated that the charge recombination process in Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites can be easily manipulated by the multifarious nature of Au nanoparticles under UV and visible light irradiation and also linearly modulated their photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activity of Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites increased with a rise in the Au content up to 1.5 wt% under UV light illumination, whereas the highest photocatalytic activity was observed upon optimal Au loading under visible light, i.e. 1 wt% with an energy conversion efficiency of 7.14%. The inconsistent trend in the rate of hydrogen evolution under UV and visible light with Au loading is due to the following two reasons: (i) recombination of SPR charge pairs because of the formation of defect sites at the Au and ZnTiO3 interface after optimum gold loading under visible light and (ii) on the other hand, the linear increase in photocatalytic activity of Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites with an increase in the Au loading under UV light is due to the separation of charge carriers at the interface formed between ZnTiO3 and Au nanoparticles through the Schottky barrier. Moreover, the interfacial defect sites in the Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites are acting like the Au-induced charge separation effect, which balances the recombination effect of Au/ZnTiO3 nanocomposites in UV-assisted photocatalytic reactions.
