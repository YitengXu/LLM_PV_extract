    , Accepted 8th November 2016First published on 9th November 2016AbstractThe Lewis acid–base reaction between PbI2 and solvent molecules is popular in fabricating PbI2 films by a two-step method for making perovskite solar cells. Here, we control the microstructure of PbI2 films through modulating the Lewis acid–base reaction by adding a small amount of N-methyl pyrrolidone into PbI2/DMF solution. PbI2 films with excellent crystallinity and full coverage are fabricated by spin-coating the mixed solution on the substrate, which leads to high quality perovskite layers with low recombination rate and high efficiency for carrier transfer. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the best perovskite solar cells increases from 13.3% to 17.5%.
1. Introduction
Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention since all-solid-state solar cells employing MAPbI3 as the active layer were reported.1 With great efforts on structural design and improving fabrication methods, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased significantly from initial 3.8% to >20%.2–7 The quality of the perovskite films, including coverage, grain size, composition, and even residual PbI2, holds the key to high performance of the PSCs. Many methods have been proposed to improve the quality of perovskite films, such as solvent engineering to obtain uniform perovskite films,8 solvent annealing to increase the grain size and crystallinity,9,10 gas–solid crystallization reaction to replace the solution process,11,12 and incorporation of an additive to precursor solutions.13–16 A two-step method (TSM) was generally used to fabricate perovskite solar cells.17,18 In a typical TSM, PbI2 films were first prepared by spin coating on the FTO substrate from solvent dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Actually, the separation of PbI2 out from the DMF or DMSO solution occurs through a Lewis acid–base reaction, where the solvent molecule acts as a Lewis base and PbI2 acts as a Lewis acid.19,20 The CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite can be regarded as a compound of PbI2 intercalated with CH3NH3I (MAI).21 It has been reported that PbI2 forms a complex in the solution by coordinating with solvent molecules, and the complex affects the quality of the final perovskite.22 Thus, the quality of the perovskite active layer can be controlled through modulating the Lewis acid–base reaction.
DMF was commonly used to dissolve PbI2 powder for making PbI2 films. But, the volatile DMF has a high saturated vapour pressure (2.7 Torr) at room temperature,23 which makes it evaporate quickly during the spin-coating process. It is hard to control the crystallinity and morphology of the PbI2 film from the PbI2/DMF solution. Furthermore, the DMF solvent has moderate solubility of PbI2 less than 1 M at room temperature, which makes the Lewis adduct of PbI2·DMF separate out easily. It has been demonstrated that the DMF molecules can coordinate with Pb2+ ions to form one-dimensional PbI2·DMF through weak Pb–O bonds,24 which leads to rapid growth of nanorod-like PbI2 grains and porous films. In order to prepare densely packed PbI2 films, it needs to increase the interaction between solvent and Pb2+ ions and slow down the reaction rate by choosing solvents with stronger Lewis basicity.

N-Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) can also form a Lewis adduct of PbI2·NMP with PbI2.25 The donor number of NMP is larger than that of the DMF due to the solvation steric effect.26,27 It indicates that NMP has stronger Lewis basicity than DMF. The equilibrium constant for the Lewis acid–base reaction decreases as the Lewis basicity gets stronger.28 Thus, the NMP solvent is likely to induce more stable Lewis adducts. Additionally, the lattice distance in the c-axis of the PbI2 is expanded from 7.3 Å to 10.5 Å through NMP molecule interaction.29 The lattice expansion of the PbI2 is beneficial to obtain high quality perovskite films.30 Thus, NMP might be used to modulate the microstructure of the PbI2 by controlling the growth process of the Lewis adducts. However, the solubility of PbI2 in the NMP solvent is lower than in DMF. Here, we try to use Hansen solubility theory,31,32 which is usually used to choose solvents for the solute, to increase the solubility of PbI2 by matching the Hansen solubility parameters. We also modulate the Lewis acid–base reaction of forming PbI2 films by adding NMP into the PbI2/DMF solution, which can significantly improve the quality of the perovskite active layer and enhance the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs.
2. Experimental
Fabrication of devices
FTO glass (TEC7, Pilkington) was subsequently cleaned with a detergent, deionized water, acetone, 2-propanol, ethanol, and deionized water, and then dried with nitrogen gas. A compact layer of TiO2 was deposited on the FTO glass by spin coating from a titanium isopropoxy solution in ethanol at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. A mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited on the compact TiO2 layer by spin coating diluted TiO2 paste (Dyesol-18NRT, Dyesol) in ethanol (2:7, weight ratio) at 4500 rpm for 30 s, and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was then infiltrated in PbI2/DMF (1.4 M) solution with different amounts of methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) additive, and then spin coated at 6500 rpm for 30 s. Before completely drying, the PbI2 precursor films were dipped into a solution of CH3NH3I (MAI) in 2-propanol with a concentration of 30 mg mL−1 for 90 s to prepare perovskite films, and then annealed at 100 °C for 60 min. After drying, a HTM layer was deposited by spin-coating a solution prepared by dissolving 100 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 40 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), 36.3 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg mL−1 TFSI in acetonitrile and 60 μL of a stock solution of 300 mg mL−1 FK102 dopant in acetonitrile in 1 mL chlorobenzene. Finally, a thin layer of gold (60 nm) was thermally evaporated on the top of HTM to form a back electrode. The active area of the electrode was fixed at 0.06 cm2.
Characterization
The perovskite films were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, MERLIN VP Compact), X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8-Advance), UV/Vis absorption spectrometry (Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR, Agilent Technologies) in the range from 400 nm to 900 nm, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (VERTEX 70v). The Lewis adducts were monitored by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/Q5000IR) from 50 to 800 °C. Impedance spectra (IS) of the PSCs were obtained in the dark by using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D) under a bias voltage of 0.8 V with an alternative signal of 10 mV in the range from 1 Hz to 106 Hz. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) decay spectra were obtained by using an FLS920 transient optical spectrometer. Steady-state PL spectra were obtained by exciting the sample with a monochromatic xenon lamp (source central wavelength λexc = 460 nm). Time-resolved PL spectra were obtained by using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) system. Samples were photo excited with a 405 nm laser beam with a wavelength of 405 nm and the frequency between 10 and 20 MHz. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was obtained by using a QEX10 solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (QEX10, PV measurements, USA). Prior to the measurement, a standard silicon solar cell was used to calibrate the system. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs were obtained by using a Keithley 4200-SCS parameter analyser sweeping from −0.1 to 1.2 V at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, illuminated under a solar simulator (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, 91195, Newport).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the FTIR transmittance spectra of the pure DMF and NMP solvents and the corresponding PbI2 precursor films. There are characteristic peaks near 1680 cm−1 in the FTIR spectra of the both solvents, corresponding to the stretching vibration of CO.20,33,34 The CO vibration downshifts as it forms a Lewis adduct due to the interaction between solvent (DMF and NMP) and PbI2. Thus, it forms Lewis adducts of PbI2·DMF and PbI2·NMP through a Lewis acid–base reaction, where PbI2 acts as a Lewis acid, and solvent acts as a Lewis base. It is noted that the Lewis basicity of the NMP is stronger than that of the DMF, which implies that the Lewis adduct of PbI2·NMP nucleates prior to the PbI2·DMF in the saturated PbI2/DMF solution adding with NMP. Fig. 1c presents the TGA spectra of PbI2 powder and the two Lewis adducts. The Lewis adduct of PbI2·DMF decomposes completely to PbI2 at 120 °C; while PbI2·NMP decomposes completely at 200 °C. It indicates that the PbI2·NMP is more stable than the PbI2·DMF due to the stronger molecular interaction with PbI2.

Fig. 2a shows the XRD spectra of the PbI2 films prepared from PbI2/DMF solutions adding with different amounts of NMP. For comparison, the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min before XRD measurements. A strong XRD peak centred at 12.6° corresponds to the (001) plane of the PbI2. The (001) peak left shifts when NMP was added into the PbI2/DMF solution (see the inset of Fig. 2a). The intensity of the (001) peak increases as the NMP, implying the enhancement of crystallinity and orientation of the PbI2 grains. The crystallinity and crystalline domain of the films, calculated from the intensity and peak of (001) diffraction, increase from 260 Å to 290 Å estimated by Scherrer's equation by adding 10% NMP. But, the crystallinity of the PbI2 film decreases when the concentration of NMP further increases to 20% (blue line in the inset of Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b presents the XRD spectra of the corresponding MAPbI3 films. The crystallinity of the MAPbI3 film is consistent with the precursor PbI2 films. The MAPbI3 fabricated from 10% NMP shows the best crystallization with the crystalline domain about 478 Å (405 Å for MAPbI3 without NMP). It is noted that there is no residual NMP in the samples after annealing at 100 °C for 30 min according to the XRD spectra. Fig. 2c shows the typical UV-absorption spectra of the corresponding MAPbI3 films. The onset of the absorption spectrum occurs at ∼775 nm, corresponding to the bandgap of MAPbI3 (∼1.6 eV).35 MAPbI3 prepared from 10% NMP shows the highest light absorption ability in the range 400 to 800 nm.

NMP has evident effects on the morphology of the PbI2 film. SEM images in Fig. 3 show the change of morphology of the PbI2 films by adding different amounts of NMP into the PbI2/DMF solution. All the samples are annealed at 100 °C for 30 min before SEM examination. By adding a small amount of NMP (≤10%), the plate-like PbI2 grains stack densely on the substrate (Fig. 3b and S1†). The dimension of PbI2 changes slightly as the concentration of NMP increases. The morphology of the PbI2 films prepared from solution with a low concentration of NMP (≤10%) is quite different from those without adding NMP (Fig. 3a and b). But, when the concentration of NMP in the PbI2/DMF solution is further increased to above 20%, the films are composed of nanorod-like and plate-like PbI2 grains (Fig. 3c). It implies that the NMP affects the nucleation and growth of PbI2, evidently. Similar to that of DMF, it also forms a Lewis adduct of PbI2·NMP, where NMP acts as a Lewis base.25 NMP has a higher boiling point and stronger interaction with PbI2 than those of the DMF. Thus, the morphology of PbI2 changes evidently with a small amount of NMP in the PbI2/DMF solution. According to Hansen solubility theory, the solubility of PbI2 in the mixed solvent of DMF and NMP increases when adding a small amount of NMP, but it decreases as the amount of NMP further increases (≥20%). The colour of the PbI2/DMF solution also gets thicker as more NMP are added into the solution (see Fig. S2†). The Lewis adducts of PbI2·NMP and PbI2·DMF separate out simultaneously from the mixed solution with high concentration of NMP. Thus, the resulting films contain nanorod-like and plate-like PbI2 crystals. The one-dimensional Lewis adduct of PbI2·DMF precipitates quickly from the solution, leading to some voids in the porous PbI2 films.36

Fig. 3 also shows the SEM images of the perovskite films and the corresponding solar cells fabricated from the solution with different amounts of NMP. The morphology of the MAPbI3 film is affected by the PbI2 film significantly. The perovskite film prepared from 10% NMP has uniform and large grains, and smooth surface, all those features are desired for high efficient PSCs (Fig. 3e and h). For comparison, there are some pinholes in the perovskite films prepared from solution without (Fig. 3d) and with 20% NMP (Fig. 3f). These pinholes have detrimental effects on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The corresponding cross-sectional SEM images show that spiro-OMeTAD might penetrate the perovskite layer through the pinholes, as shown by the doted circles in Fig. 3g and i.

Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves of the best PSCs fabricated from different concentrations of NMP. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are also listed in Table 1. The PSC prepared from 10% NMP has the highest photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.5%, a current density (Jsc) of 22.6 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.02 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.76, which is better than those without adding NMP (Jsc = 19.1 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.96 V, FF = 0.72, PCE = 13.3%). The PCE is enhanced significantly by 31.6% when 10% NMP was added to the PbI2/DMF solution and the average PCE is increased from 8.7% to 15.3%. However, the photovoltaic performance decreased seriously when the NMP concentration exceeded 20% due to the pinholes in the perovskite layer (see Fig. 3f and i). The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) further demonstrates that the PSCs fabricated from 10% NMP exhibit higher quantum yield throughout the entire wavelength than that without NMP, which leads to a higher integrated current density (Fig. 4b). It is noted that the integrated Jsc from IPCE is approximately 10% lower than those obtained from the reverse scan. This discrepancy might derive from the spectral mismatch between the IPCE light source and solar simulator, and also might derive from the decay of the devices during the measurement in air.37 We also measured the dependence of photocurrent density (J) and PCE on time by applying a bias voltage near the maximum output power point. As shown in Fig. 4c, the device fabricated from 10% NMP shows higher stability than the device fabricated without NMP. Both of the steady photocurrent and PCE are lower than those obtained from the reverse scan. This phenomenon has been widely observed in many different structure PSCs with evident hysteresis behaviours (also see Fig. S3†).38–41 Photocurrent rising time is defined as the time taken to reach 95% of the maximum output stabilized power output.41 The photocurrent rising time of PSC reduced from 23 s to 18 s when adding 10% NMP into the PbI2/DMF solution. The reduction in the photocurrent rising time indicates the decrease of traps in the perovskite devices. The statistic charts of 14 devices also exhibit the similar tendency to the best PSCs as shown in Fig. 5. And the performance of PSCs fabricated from 10% NMP shows a higher reproducibility due to the high quality of the perovskite layer.

We obtained the impedance spectra (IS) of PSCs in the dark under a bias voltage of 0.8 V. As shown in Fig. 6a, the simplified equivalent circuit was used to analysis the carrier transportation and recombination in PSCs (inset of Fig. 6a).42–45 In this model, Rs is the series resistance between two electrodes; RHTM in parallel with chemical capacity (CPEHTM) is related to the diffusion of holes through the hole transport materials (HTM); and the recombination resistance (Rrec) in parallel with the chemical capacity (Crec) is related to charge recombination at the two interface (ETL/MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/HTL). The recombination resistance (Rrec) is inversely related to the recombination rate of carriers.42 The fitting results based on the equivalent circuit model are listed in Table 1. Rs is almost unchanged for all devices (∼11 Ω). The Rrec of the PSCs fabricated from 10% NMP is 632 Ω, which is twice higher than that without NMP, as well as with 20% NMP. The highest Rrec in the PSC indicates the lowest recombination rate due to the high quality of the perovskite films. This is the main reason for the higher Voc and FF in the PSC fabricated from 10% NMP.

We also obtained the steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra. The configuration of the sample for the steady-state PL spectrum is shown in the inset in Fig. 6b. The PL spectra have broad peaks located in the range of 750–780 nm, corresponding to the bandgap of MAPbI3 (∼1.6 eV), which is consistent with the UV absorption (Fig. 2c). Compared with PSC without adding NMP, the PL intensity of PSC prepared from 10% NMP decreased significantly. The reduction of the PL intensity is due to the better hole injection into the spiro-OMeTAD layer.46,47 To confirm the charge transfer process in PSCs, the time-resolved PL spectra were also obtained. Fig. 6c shows the corresponding time-resolved PL spectra. The spectra can be well fitted with a bi-exponential decay equation (1): (1)where τ1 and τ2 are the decay time of the two decay processes, respectively. The fitting results are given in Table 1. It indicates that there are a fast and a slow decay in the PSCs. The fast decay process is regarded as a result of the quench effect of free carriers in the perovskite film domain through transport to ETL or HTL; whereas the slow decay process is regarded as the radiative decay.48 The fast decay life time (τ1) reduced from 0.87 ns to 0.65 ns when adding 10% NMP. It indicates that the charge transfer in the PSC fabricated from 10% NMP is faster than in PSC without NMP, which is consistent with the steady PL spectra. So, the highest Jsc in PSC from 10% NMP is ascribed to better hole injection, fast transfer as well as slight stronger light harvest ability in the entire wavelength range (Fig. 2c).
4. Conclusions
The Lewis acid–base reaction is popular in the fabrication of PbI2 thin films from organic solvents in the typical two-step method. The Lewis acid–base reaction between the PbI2 and DMF solution is modulated by NMP. Due to the strong Lewis basicity of NMP, it retards the growth of the Lewis adduct of PbI2·DMF. As a result, densely packed PbI2 films with high crystallinity are obtained by adding a small amount of NMP into the PbI2/DMF solution. The photovoltaic performances of the perovskite solar cells are thus enhanced significantly. Here, we provide a method to fabricate high quality perovskite active layers and enhance the photovoltaic performance of solar cells.
