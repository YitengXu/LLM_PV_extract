    , Accepted 27th January 2021First published on 27th January 2021AbstractAchieving high-efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) requires well balancing the trade-off between the voltage loss and photocurrent generation of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends. In this work, we develop high-performance ITO-free OSCs through incorporating a newly designed column-patterned microcavity (CPM) for effective optical confinement of thin near-infrared BHJs. With the assistance of optical interference, light scattering and local surface plasmons of patterned electrodes, the photocurrent density (Jsc) values of OSCs are largely improved for thin BHJs with near 100 nm thickness. In addition, the high open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) are secured in self-assembled monolayer (SAM) treated ITO-free OSCs. As a result, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ITO-free OSCs in the inverted architecture have reached 15.5% and 17.5% for ternary PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-Th:IT-4F and binary PM6:Y6 blends, respectively, yet exhibiting the desirable features of less incident angle dependence. Overall, these OSCs with CPM not only reach significant performance-enhancement over the corresponding ITO devices, but also represent the best performing ITO-free OSCs so far.

Broader context
Solar photon-to-electricity conversion has a strong impact on maintaining the environmental sustainability and energy-demand of the global community. As one of the emerging photovoltaics, organic solar cells (OSCs) are on the eve toward practical relevance, making remarkable progress in recent years. Still, there remain critical challenges that prevent achieving high-efficiency OSCs. Due to the relatively low charge transport capability of organic semiconductors, OSCs usually suffer from insufficient light absorption with thin bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends. In addition, to achieve high power conversion efficiencies, an effective methodology is needed to balance the trade-off between voltage loss and photocurrent generation in OSCs. In this work, collaborative research teams from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and Zhejiang University have demonstrated that the newly designed column-patterned microcavity (CPM) contributes to the effective optical confinement of thin near-infrared BHJs for OSCs. It shows that indium tin oxide (ITO)-free OSCs containing a CPM architecture exhibit not only largely improved photocurrent density, but also high open-circuit voltage and fill factor, over those of traditional ITO OSCs. As a result, the best performing ITO-free OSCs so far have been developed, yet exhibiting the desirable feature of performance with less incident angle dependence.

Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved raid progress in recent years in reaching over 17% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs),1–6 largely benefitting from the evolution of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs)7–9 and the related device architecture.10–12 Over the past 20 years, the PCEs of fullerene-based OSCs have reached about 12%13,14 due to encountering significant energy losses (>0.6 eV) and poor absorption in longer wavelength regions.15,16 In contrast, NFA based OSCs allow utilization of a broad range of solar photons from visible to near infrared with mitigated energy losses, resulting in improved short circuit current (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the devices.1,7,12,17 Thus far, the majority of efficient NFA OSCs only work well with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer of ∼100 nm optimal thickness.1,4–6 Under such conditions, efficient OSCs can reach near 100% internal quantum efficiency,18,19 that is, every absorbed photon in the BHJ layer can be converted into a free carrier. However, such OSCs still suffer from insufficient light capture with thin BHJ layers (∼100 nm), with less than 80% absorption rate and external quantum efficiency (EQE),1,3 hence undermining their attainable efficiencies. Usually, increasing the BHJ thickness often leads to deteriorated efficiencies, due to the increased charge transport distance in BHJs resulting in severe charge recombination within the devices.20,21
To alleviate the above mentioned challenges, optical engineering of OSCs, such as light scattering,22 anti-reflection,23 optical spacer,24,25 prismatic devices26 and microcavity architecture27–31 have been developed to enlarge the light transporting pathway in BHJs, hence improving light absorption of OSCs. In addition, the engineering of absorber layers, such as ternary32–34 and double-layered14,35 BHJs, was developed. Practically, the introduction of a third semiconducting component with a large bandgap into BHJs could enhance Voc but decrease near infrared absorption, and vice versa, requiring the fine tuning of the blend morphology for ternary OSCs. A planar microcavity architecture could notably enhance light absorption of OSCs, while showing strong incident angle dependence of light reflection and photovoltaic performance.31 Furthermore, the development of efficient photovoltaic materials, such as nonfullerene acceptors like Y6, extends near-infrared (NIR) light absorption up to 920 nm,1,17 but, however, is not coherent in the conventional planar microcavity device.31 From the device point of view, there are complicated trade-offs among photon absorption, charge generation and recombination, as well as performance parameters, which remain unsolved in conventional device approaches.
In this paper, we demonstrate that highly efficient ITO-free OSCs can be developed through incorporating the newly designed column-patterned microcavity (CPM), achieving a high-performance of 17.5% PCE based on nonfullerene BHJs. The CPM for optical confinement significantly improves both visible and NIR photon absorption of thin BHJs (∼100 nm). With the assistance of optical interference, light scattering and local surface plasmon effect of patterned electrodes, the resultant ITO-free OSCs achieve the large improvement of the Jsc values. Meanwhile, the high voltages and fill factors (FF) are secured in self-assembled monolayer (SAM) treated OSCs. As a result, the PCEs of ITO-free OSCs have been improved to 15.5% and 17.5% for PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-Th:IT-4F ternary BHJ and PM6:Y6 birnary BHJ, respectively, accounting for 23% and 16% enchancement compared to the corresponding ITO OSCs. The studied devices with PM6:Y6 birnary BHJ represent the best among the reported ITO-free OSCs so far. Notably, such an integrative design enables OSCs with less incident angle dependence of their photovoltaic performance. Overall, we provide herein an effective strategy to access highly efficient OSCs, through resolving the critical trade-offs between photon harvesting and charge extraction faced by conventional OSC devices.
Device configuration

Fig. 1 shows the chemical structures of active materials, and their optoelectronic properties, as well as the OSC device with a CPM configuration. The polymer poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexylthio)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))]-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′] dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T-SF)8 is employed as an electron donor, and non-fullerene electron acceptors 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(5-hexylthienyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (ITIC-Th)36 and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-((3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-6,7-difluoro)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IT-4F)8 are utilized, as shown in Fig. 1a. The interfacial modifier of 4-((1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-inden-2-ylidene)methyl)benzoic acid (SAM-ID) was used atop of a ZnO nanoparticle (ZnO-NP) electron transport layer (ETL) on a thick Ag electrode.37 The common inverted ITO-based device employed a structure of glass/ITO/ZnO-NP (30 nm)/BHJ/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm). The planar microcavity (MC) and CPM device are composed of glass/PDMS (60 μm)/Ag (100 nm)/FPI-PEIE (5 nm)/ZnO-NP (20 nm)/SAM-ID (3 nm)/BHJ/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (10 nm)/TeO2 (40 nm), as shown in Fig. 1b. The MC devices have co-existent two-resonance-tapping cavities, one resulting from the metal–metal (Ag–Ag) cavity and the other resulting from the dielectric-metal (TeO2–Ag) cavity,38,39 which together adjust the optical resonance to enhance the light absorption intensity in the BHJ layer and reduce light reflectivity.28,31 Also, the refractive index of TeO2 (n ∼ 2.1) is much higher than that of Ag (n ∼ 0.15), which effectively reduces the light reflection rate at the Ag/air interface.31 IT-4F based BHJ blends have a low bandgap of 1.52 eV and strong visible-near infrared absorption coefficient up to 800 nm, which match well with the enhanced light absorption range of the above cavity structure.8,31,40 Although relatively good photocurrent can be obtained, the PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F based OSC has a relatively low Voc of 0.87 V.40 From the energy diagrams of the device in Fig. 1c, ITIC-Th could form an energy cascade to PBDB-T-SF and IT-4F, with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of −3.93 eV (ITIC-Th),36 which is higher than that of IT-4F (−4.14 eV).8 Meanwhile, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of ITIC-Th and IT-4F are almost identical as −5.66 eV. ITIC-Th also shows complimentary light absorption to that of the PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F film around the wavelength of 650 nm. As shown in Fig. 1d, the complex index of refraction for PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-Th:IT-4F blends with a varied ratio was measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry. It can be seen that increasing the ratio of ITIC-Th in the ternary BHJ film leads to lower IT-4F absorption around 750 nm, whereas to enhanced absorption between 400 nm and 725 nm.

Prior to device fabrication, we performed optical modeling based on the transfer matrix method (TMM) to investigate the optical distribution and light absorption in the ITO-free MC and ITO based devices, respectively. The structure of the MC device has been designed with a bottom electrode of Ag (100 nm) and upper electrode of Ag (10 nm)/TeO2 (40 nm),31,40 ensuring to enhance the co-existent two-resonance-tapping cavities, Ag–Ag and TeO2–Ag cavities (Fig. S1, ESI†). By assuming the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) to be unity at all wavelengths, we calculated the thickness dependence of the photocurrent Jsc for the ternary BHJ layer on the different ratios in the ITO and planar MC based devices, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The photocurrent of a ternary MC device could reach a maximum value of 85 nm with a BHJ layer under different ternary ratios of PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-Th:IT-4F active film. It is worth noting that the Jsc of the planar MC device remains steady at high values when varying the amount (less than 50%) of ITIC-Th in the PBDB-T-SF:IT-4F BHJ layer, which is largely different from the apparent decrease of photocurrent in the ITO based device.

Results and discussion
To obtain an optimal blend ratio for the ternary active film, the ITO based and planar MC OSCs containing different ternary blends (∼85 nm) with a varied ratio of PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-Th:IT-4F were fabricated and their photovoltaic performances are summarized in Fig. 2c and d. For the ITO based devices, it is shown that the increase of the ITIC-Th component in the active film can improve Voc from 0.87 V to 0.98 V due to enlarged energy difference between the HOMOD of the donor and LUMOA of the acceptor from 1.24 eV to 1.45 eV, which is beneficial for improving Voc. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. S2, ESI†) show that the ternary film has a smoother surface than that of the binary blend. However, the Jsc and FF values were gradually decreased, resulting in an only slightly enhanced PCE of 12.61% with a ternary PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-Th:IT-4F (1:0.2:0.8) film. This is because this ternary blend shows absorption loss in the near infrared region, compared to that of the binary blend, which leads to a trade-off between the Voc and Jsc values commonly encountered in ternary OSCs.32,34,41,42
To solve this trade-off, we employed a planar MC structure to replenish the absorption loss of the ternary blend, meanwhile maintaining the high Voc of the devices. Fig. 2d shows that the PCEs of binary and ternary MC devices are both improved to 13.7% and 14.4%, respectively, attributed to the higher Jsc values of −21.8 mA cm−2 in the planar MC based OSCs. Further optical analysis indicates the light distribution and exciton generation rates in the ITO and ITO-free planar MC based OSCs, wherein ternary PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-Th:IT-4F (1:0.2:0.8) BHJ films (85 nm) are used to simulate their panchromatic optical field. Fig. S3 (ESI†) presents that the light distribution |E|2 in the BHJ layer of a ternary planar MC device is much stronger than that of the ITO device, especially in the near infrared range around 800 nm. Also, the exciton generation rates (G) of ITO and MC based OSCs are calculated in Fig. 2e and f, where G3 is the exciton generation rate of the ternary BHJ device, and G2 is for the binary BHJ device. It shows that the planar MC based device enhances the exciton generation rate G3,MC in the wavelength range from 415 to 800 nm compared with that (G3,ITO) of an ITO based device. This contributes to the achievable photocurrent of ∼22.15 mA cm−2 in planar MC OSCs versus 19.86 mA cm−2 of the ITO based OSC. Fig. 2g gives the difference of exciton generation rate by calculating G3,MC − G3,ITO, which clearly presents the enhanced exciton generation rate from 415 to 800 nm in the BHJ film. The enhancement of light absorption agrees well with the notable improvement in Jsc and PCE performances in ITO-free MC based OSCs.
Another interesting observation is that the Jsc values of MC devices with binary and ternary (1:0.2:0.8) BHJs are almost equal (−21.81 mA cm−2), whereas the ternary BHJ has intrinsically lower absorption in the near infrared range (Fig. 1d). This is due to MC devices compensating the optical loss of the ternary blend by enhancing exciton generation from 350 to 670 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†). The enlarged difference of exciton generation rates is calculated as ΔG2 (binary MC vs. ITO devices) and ΔG3 (ternary MC vs. ITO devices) (Fig. S5, ESI†). It shows that the ternary MC device has higher exciton generation rate at the band edge from 670 to 770 nm than that of the binary MC device. The main reason is that binary BHJ shows strong absorption at the band edge, which possesses limited room for absorption enhancement in MC devices. In contrast, the ternary BHJ has weak absorption in this range that achieves strong improvement in a ternary MC device. Conceptually, it provides a useful protocol that allows balancing the trade-off among photovoltage and photocurrent of ternary BHJs, wherein a wide bandgap third component is used to replace narrow bandgap materials.
Although the planar MC structure could enhance optical intensity and light harvesting, there is almost 13% incident light being reflected out of the device. In addition, the planar MC device shows strong angle dependence of the absorption, which is even more sensitive than that of a conventional ITO device, as revealed by TMM calculations (Fig. 3). To solve the above problems, we utilized a nanoimprinting method,23 to create a columnar nanopattern at both the upper and lower surfaces of the ternary BHJ layer, which is to enhance the light scattering of the MC devices. As shown in Fig. 4, the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) template was firstly imprinted by the shaped column-etched Si mold, then followed by the evaporation of a 100 nm thick Ag electrode onto the PDMS template. The subsequent ZnO-NP/SAM and BHJ layers atop of nanostructured Ag could retain the imprinted patterns, with relatively small and smooth features (Fig. 4a). In order to make a well patterned BHJ morphology, we added an additional imprinting step atop of the BHJ layer, to ensure a rough top BHJ surface. Then, the UTMF-Ag and TeO2 layers were evaporated to finish the final device, named as the CPM device. Fig. 4a shows that the column-patterned morphology is well kept from the bottom PDMS template to the top MoO3/Ag/TeO2 layer. Thus, the optical simulations of the studied devices were carried out based on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) analysis. Fig. 4b, c and d present the optical distribution at the selected wavelength of 750 nm in the ITO, MC and CPM devices under vertical incident light, respectively. It shows that the optical distribution in the BHJ layer of the CPM device is much stronger than that of both ITO and MC devices, especially in the region near the UTMF interface, which enhances light absorption of the blend, thus improving the photocurrent in the devices. Furthermore, the angle dependent light absorption of CPM is calculated in Fig. 3c, which shows weak angle dependence within a large incident angle for the wavelengths from 430 to 800 nm. Fig. 4e presents the angle dependent photocurrent of ITO, MC and CPM devices. It can be seen that the photocurrent of the CPM device can be maintained at a high level until the incident angle of solar light is higher than 75°, which is much better than those of ITO and MC devices and adds value in the practical application of OSCs. Additionally, the optical simulation (Fig. S6, ESI†) reveals that the twice-patterned structure could enhance the light intensity and scattering compared to that of once-patterned and none-patterned devices.

Fig. 5 shows the J–V characteristics and EQE curves of ITO, MC and CPM devices and the corresponding photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 1. It shows that the CPM devices exhibit much improvement in the Jsc of 22.9 mA cm−2 and EQE (integrated Jsc is 22.6 mA cm−2) due to both enhanced optical intensity and light scattering of the twice patterned structure. Meanwhile, the Voc remains almost the same as for the MC device. In addition, note that ZnO-NPs typically possess charge trapping sites and energetic mismatch to that of non-fullerene acceptors. To enhance charge extraction of the device, we introduced a SAM-ID layer atop of ZnO-NP to improve the BHJ/ZnO-NP heterojunction of CPM OSCs.37 The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of ZnO-NP with and without SAM modification on the Ag/FPI-PEIE electrode is presented in Fig. S7 and Table S1 (ESI†). It shows that the SAM-ID layer decreases the work function of the ZnO-NP electron transporting layer from 3.86 eV to 3.52 eV, which allows enhancement of the electron collection efficiency of the ZnO-NP layer on the Ag cathode. Also, the water contact angle of ZnO-NP is enhanced from 49.3° to 72.5°. Via selectively matching the surface energy, SAM-ID allows promoting phase segregation of nonfullerene acceptors at the bottom contact.37 From the EQE profiles in Fig. 5b, it shows that the SAM-ID modified MC and CPM devices enhance the photoresponse in the 750–800 nm wavelength range (the absorption of IT-4F). As a result, the SAM-ID modified planar MC and CPM devices allow retention of good FF values (73.0%, 72.7%) and improved Jsc performances (−22.0 mA cm−2 and −22.9 mA cm−2), resulting in the excellent PCEs of 14.8% (MC) and 15.5% (CPM), respectively. These are state-of-the-art PCEs among the reported NFA OSCs with the absorption edge less than 800 nm. The SAM modified CPM devices show flat and ultra-high EQE characteristics of about 88% in the wide wavelength range from 450 nm to 780 nm, reaching near 100% IQE.28,31

To quantify the improvement of performance, these devices were estimated by plotting the photocurrent density (Jph = Jlight − Jdark) as a function of effective voltage (Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the voltage when Jph = 0), as shown in Fig. 6a. For the studied devices, Jph are saturated at Jsat as the Veff are close to 1 V and thus maximum exciton generation Gmax of the devices can be calculated using the equation Jsat = q·L·Gmax, where L is the thickness of the BHJ film. The Gmax of the ternary CPM device with the SAM-ID layer is much higher than that of the other devices, which can be attributed to the both enhanced light absorption in the CPM structure and better charge extraction upon SAM modification. This clearly demonstrates that the ternary blend on the ZnO-NP/SAM-ID layer in the CPM structure generates more free charge carriers than other devices. We further measured the light intensity dependent Jsc and Voc characteristics of the studied devices, from which recombination losses e.g., monomolecular and/or bimolecular recombination of the devices, can be analyzed.43Fig. 6b shows the relationship between Voc and light intensity (P0) of the studied devices including the ITO based binary and ternary BHJs, planar MC and CPM devices. It has reported that the slope of Vocversus ln(P0) is equal to 1kbT/q when bimolecular recombination is dominant, and the slope is close to 2kbT/q when trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination is dominant.44 It can be seen that the slopes of 1.38kbT/q (ITO device with binary BHJ), 1.28kbT/q (ITO device with ternary BHJ), 1.16kbT/q (MC device) and 1.11kbT/q (CPM device) are relatively greater than that of 1.09kbT/q for an SAM modified MC device. The results indicate that using ternary BHJ, MC structure and SAM-ID modification could mitigate the trap-assisted recombination of devices. They are mainly attributed to the energy cascade of ternary BHJ,41 higher density of photogenerated charges in bulk using an MC device,31 and improved charge extraction at the ZnO surface upon SAM modification,37 respectively. Under short-circuit conditions, Fig. 6c shows linear dependence of ln(Jsc) versus light intensity ln(P0) of the five studied devices with slopes close to 1, indicating that bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions in these devices can be negligible. The series Rs and parallel resistances Rp of OSCs are extracted by fitting the J–V curves based on an equivalent circuit model, as shown in Fig. S8 and Table S2 (ESI†). The Rs of the studied OSCs are all less than 1.1 Ω cm2, which agrees with their ultra-low bimolecular recombination and high FF performance. All these results prove that the CPM structure and SAM-ID layer facilitate more efficient exciton generation and dissociation into free charge carriers, leading to improved Jsc and FF of the ternary OSCs.

To verify the applicability of the CPM device architecture, we further employed a high-performance BHJ, PM6:Y6 blend with high light absorption rate in the near infrared region to 900 nm. The reference inverted device of ITO/ZnO/PM6:Y6 (100 nm)/MoO3/Ag exhibited a PCE of 15.02% ± 0.5 (Voc = 0.846 V, Jsc = −24.9 mA cm−2 and FF = 73.7%), similar to the reported work.1 Furthermore, the MC and CPM devices were constructed with the structure of glass/PDMS/Ag/ZnO-NP/SAM-ID/PM6:Y6 (100 nm)/MoO3/UTMF-Ag/TeO2. Their J–V curves and EQE characteristics are presented in Fig. 7 with photovoltaic performances summarized in Table 2. It shows that the Jsc of the MC device is improved from −24.9 mA cm−2 (ITO device) to −26.6 mA cm−2, which is attributed to the enhanced light coupling and absorption in the wide range from 400 nm to 800 nm, resulting in the PCE of the MC device reaching 16.4%. When using a SAM-ID modifying layer on the ZnO-NP layer, the MC device has both improved Jsc of −26.8 mA cm−2 and FF of 74.6%, leading to a PCE of 17.0%. However, the extended NIR light absorption from 800 nm to 920 nm of the MC device is lower than that of the ITO device due to non-coherence in this range of incident light, and it has also been demonstrated that the conventional MC OSCs could not enhance NIR light absorption over 800 nm.31 To compensate this portion of NIR energy loss, a CPM device is employed to obtain a much improved Jsc of −27.8 mA cm−2 and FF of 74.5%, leading to the high PCE of 17.5%, which is one of the best inverted OSCs reported so far.1,3–6,17 It is worth noting that about 1.7 mA cm−2 gain of Jsc is obtained in the planar MC device when compared with glass-ITO based cells. A further gain of Jsc of about 1.2 mA cm−2 is achieved in the CPM devices when compared with the planar MC device, which is due to the MC architecture where the column patterned surface allows significantly enhanced visible and NIR light absorption of BHJs, while involving negligible charge recombination, leading to the much improved Jsc values of the OSCs. To figure out the performance enhancement of our CPM architecture, we have calculated the enhancement ratios for EQE over those of ITO devices in Fig. 7b, and a series of recently reported OSCs involving optical design are surveyed in Fig. S9 (ESI†). It shows that nanoimprinted45,46 and MC31 devices have strong EQE enhancement ratios in the visible range. And the plasmonic Ag doped devices47,48 have a selective enhancement in a further short wavelength. Interestingly, our CPM architecture greatly enhances both visible and NIR light from 420 nm to 975 nm, by simultaneously combining the optical interference, angle independent light scattering and local plasmonic effects. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 17.5% and Jsc of 27.8 mA cm−2 are the best values for binary PM6:Y6 BHJ based OSCs, as well as ITO-free OSCs reported so far.1,3,17,49–55 Also, the 15.5% PCE and Jsc of 22.9 mA cm−2 are the highest values for IT-4F based OSCs17,51,52,56–59 (Fig. S9c and Table S3, ESI†). These results present that the CPM architecture is applicable for strong absorption enhancement of both visible and near-infrared BHJs to break through the performance bottleneck of OSCs.

In conclusion, highly efficient ITO-free OSCs have been developed through incorporating the column-patterned microcavity architecture, achieving 15.5% PCE for ternary PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-Th:IT-4F BHJs and 17.5% PCE based on binary PM6:Y6 BHJs, respectively, which account for 23% and 16% enchancement compared to the corresponding inverted ITO OSCs. The CPM simultaneously enhances the visible and NIR light absorption of thin BHJs (∼100 nm) by strong optical interference and light scattering effects, leading to much improved Jsc values of OSCs. Meanwhile, the high voltages and fill factors (FF) were secured in self-assembled monolayer treated OSCs. Notably, these ITO-free OSCs have exhibited the desirable features of less incident angle dependence of the photovoltaic performance, and the device with the PM6:Y6 blend represents one of the best among the reported ITO-free OSCs. Overall, this work provides an effective strategy to access highly efficient OSCs.
Methods
Fabrication of ITO-based inverted devices
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in detergent, DI water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol by 10 min sonication steps, followed by 20 s of plasma treatment. Subsequently, ZnO precursor from zinc acetylacetonate hydrate (purchased from Aldrich and used as received) dissolved in ethanol (20 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO surface or Ag films, and subsequently baked at 130 °C for 10 min in air.60 The PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-Th:IT-4F ternary blend (ratio of 1:0.2:0.8, 14 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene with 0.5% volume DIO) was then spun at 1800 rpm for 40 s (active-layer thickness 85 nm). For the PBDBT-2F:Y6 binary BHJ, the solution was prepared with a ratio of 1:1.2, with a concentration of 16 mg mL−1 in chloroform with chloronaphthalene 0.5% by volume. The solutions were then spun to obtain an active-layer thickness of 100 nm. Then, an 8 nm thick MoO3 layer and 100 nm Ag were deposited on the BHJ film to complete the inverted device structure. The OSC active area (3.14 × 10−2 cm2) of the devices was defined by shadow masks when evaporating the Ag electrode.
Fabrication of patterned micro-cavity OSCs
The flat polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) template was firstly fabricated by spin-casting a Sylgard 184B PDMS elastomer on the glass or polyimide substrate. Thereafter, the surface shaped Si mold (with square pillar array: diameter 145 nm, height 170 nm, period 300 nm) was pressed on the semi-liquid PDMS film, and placed up-side-down. Then, the mold was transferred to a vacuum chamber and subsequently heated on a hot plate for 4 h at 80 °C. Then, the PDMS layers were peeled from the Si mold to obtain firstly a nanopatterned PDMS surface. The PDMS substrates were washed in an ultrasonic cleaner bath for 15 min and were then sterilized with 70% ethanol and UV irradiation. Then a 100 nm thick Ag electrode was evaporated onto the PDMS template to generate a bottom electrode. The FPI-PEIE consisted of 5% v/v PEIE (0.4 wt% in methanol) and Bis-OMe FPI (2 mg mL−1 in methanol) was spin-coated onto the substrates. After that, solution coatings of ZnO-NP and SAM-ID layers37 were deposited onto the Ag/FPI-PEIE electrode as an electron transporting layer (ETL). Then, the PBDB-T-SF:ITIC-Th:IT-4F ternary blend and PBDBT-2F:Y6 binary BHJ were spin-coated onto the ETL layer. Additionally, another imprinting step atop of the BHJ layer using an Si mold ensures a rough top surface by alimenting the cross marks on the PDMS film and Si mode via a high-resolution microscope (Fig. S10, ESI†). The 12 nm UTMF-Ag electrodes were evaporated via a mask, which defined a device area of 3.14 × 10−2 cm2. Finally, a 40 nm thick TeO2 top-capping layer was thermal evaporated on UTMF-Ag at the rate of 0.2 Å s−1, named as a patterned micro-cavity (CPM) device. Then, the UTMF-Ag and TeO2 layers were evaporated to finish the final device.
Characterization of OSCs
The J–V curves of OPV devices were measured under an inert environment. The photocurrent of the devices was recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated 1 sun illumination via a 300 W xenon arc solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. The illumination intensity was corrected using a calibrated KG5 color filter covered standard Si photodiode detector, which was traced back to the standard cell of National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The EQE spectra of the OPV devices were measured by an IPCE measurement system consisting of a Xenon lamp (Oriel, 450 W) as the light source, a monochromator, a chopper fixed frequency of 400 Hz, a lock-in amplifier, and a standard Si photodiode detector (J115711-1-Si) for calibration.
Optical simulations
The simulations of light distribution, exciton generation, and thickness dependence of photocurrent from individual layers within the devices were obtained using the transfer matrix method (TMM).31 The optical properties of each layer are represented by the index of refraction (ñ = n + ik) of each material, which was measured using a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (VASE). All the simulations of optical properties and exciton generation are based on the assumptions of planar interfaces and isotropy for the layers within the devices. For the OSCs with ITO or CPM based structures, the simulations of optical and exciton generation adopt exactly the same layer thickness as those used in the practical devices. To calculate the exciton generation rate, theoretically the maximum photocurrent density and loss portion in Jsc, 100% internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and AM1.5 intensity spectrum (ASTM G173-03) are assumed. For devices with subwavelength patterning, geometric optics based on the ray tracing method cannot be used for simulating the photon flux distribution in nanoscale optical fields. To simulate the field radiation pattern of TE and TM polarized light in the devices, the FDTD method was adopted using a commercial FDTD solver (Lumerical FDTD Solutions 8.7.3), in which columnar closely packed nanostructures with a continuously tapered profile were used for simplicity instead of a randomly distributed geometry.

Broader context
Solar photon-to-electricity conversion has a strong impact on maintaining the environmental sustainability and energy-demand of the global community. As one of the emerging photovoltaics, organic solar cells (OSCs) are on the eve toward practical relevance, making remarkable progress in recent years. Still, there remain critical challenges that prevent achieving high-efficiency OSCs. Due to the relatively low charge transport capability of organic semiconductors, OSCs usually suffer from insufficient light absorption with thin bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends. In addition, to achieve high power conversion efficiencies, an effective methodology is needed to balance the trade-off between voltage loss and photocurrent generation in OSCs. In this work, collaborative research teams from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and Zhejiang University have demonstrated that the newly designed column-patterned microcavity (CPM) contributes to the effective optical confinement of thin near-infrared BHJs for OSCs. It shows that indium tin oxide (ITO)-free OSCs containing a CPM architecture exhibit not only largely improved photocurrent density, but also high open-circuit voltage and fill factor, over those of traditional ITO OSCs. As a result, the best performing ITO-free OSCs so far have been developed, yet exhibiting the desirable feature of performance with less incident angle dependence.
