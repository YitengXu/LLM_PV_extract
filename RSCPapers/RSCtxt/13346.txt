    , Accepted 8th July 2020First published on 8th July 2020AbstractStructure fine-tuning is effective to optimize the energy level matching and morphology in polymer solar cells (PSCs), and is important to enhance the photovoltaic performance. Here, we report a fine-tuning approach by introducing a methyl group in the 4-position of the conjugated thiophene side chains. A series of polymeric donors are synthesized based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) units with 4-alkyl-5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene conjugated side chains. Methyl, ethyl, and n-hexyl are employed as the 4-alkyl groups to afford polymers PMT49, PET52, and PHT53, respectively, and PTh37 is the control polymer without 4-alkyl groups. It is found that the introduction of a 4-alkyl group can lower the energy levels, leading to enhanced open-circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs. PMT49 shows higher charge mobilities in blend films and more optimized morphology with smaller domain size and little decrease of domain purity than other alkyl group modified polymers. As a result, PMT49:ITIC PSCs processed from toluene exhibit a better average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.0% than the PTh37 (10.6%), PET52 (9.68%) and PHT53 (7.85%) based PSCs. Furthermore, PMT50 with the 5-(2-ethylhexylthio)-4-methylthiophene side chains is synthesized. PMT50:Y6(BO) PSCs exhibit an impressive average PCE of 15.1% when processed from 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, significantly higher than the devices processed from PEHTT:Y6(BO) without methyl functionalization (12.8%). Our studies suggest that methyl functionalization on conjugated side chains is a simple but effective fine-tuning strategy to develop conjugated polymers for high performance PSCs processed from non-chlorinated solvents.
1 Introduction
Motivated by the advantages of solution-processability,1 semitransparency,2,3 and flexibility,3–6 polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been considered as a promising renewable energy technology for new applications.7,8 Thanks to the development of polymeric donors,9–12 fused ring electron acceptors (FREAs)13–18 and interface engineering,19,20 continuous advancement in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs has been demonstrated in recent years.20–23 PCEs of over 17% have been realized for single junction devices at lab scale.24,25
High performance PSCs are generally constructed from the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure of polymeric donors and small molecule acceptors.26 To achieve high PCEs, these two kinds of materials are required to have good matching of light absorption, energy level alignments, charge mobility, and miscibility.15 These properties, especially absorption, are mainly determined by the conjugated backbones.27,28 Structure fine-tuning is effective to modulate energy levels and miscibility, so that the matching between donors and acceptors is optimized.29–31 The introduction of heteroatoms (such as fluorine32 and chlorine33,34) and alkyl side chain engineering35,36 are widely applied. Besides, conjugated side chain modification on polymeric donors is also an effective way for structure fine-tuning, which can enlarge the molecular conjugation and enhance the interchain interactions.11 Furthermore, conjugated side chains, for example 5-alkylthiophene side chains, could allow additional functionalization to tune the properties. In this concern, fluorine30,37 and chlorine34,38 have been introduced in the 4-position on 5-alkylthiophene conjugated side chains, while alkylthio39–41 and alkylsilyl42 have been introduced in the 5-position of thiophene conjugated side chains. Aiming to improve the performance of FREA based PSCs fabricated from non-chlorinated solvents, processing solvent screening43,44 and structural engineering21 on both polymeric donors and FREAs have been applied. For example, the FTAZ:IT-M delivered PCEs over 11% in PSCs fabricated from toluene,43 and sequential deposition of the FTAZ polymer from (R)-(+)-limonene and the IT-M acceptor from 2-methyltetrahydrofuran further improved the PCE to 12.5%.44 Recently, a longer alkyl side chain was employed in the Y6 acceptor and a third component was introduced in the PBDB-TF donor to form a terpolymer (PBDB-TF-T1) for improving their solubility in eco-compatible solvents, and their PSCs showed high PCEs of over 16% when processed from tetrahydrofuran.21
Previously, we developed methoxy and methyl thioether functionalization in the 4-position of 5-alkylthiophene side chains as a structure fine-tuning approach, which can effectively lower the energy levels by 0.1 eV and enhance the intermolecular interactions and solubilities.45–48 The methoxy modified PMOT1647 and methyl thioether modified PMTT5648 showed enhanced open-circuit voltages (VOCs) and PCEs in PSCs compared to unmodified counterparts. The improved solubility of PMOT16 and PMTT56 also reveals good performance of PSCs processed from non-chlorinated solvents.
In this work, we investigate the modification effects of alkyl groups in 4-position of the 5-alkylthiophene conjugated side chains. A series of polymeric donors are synthesized with 4-alkyl-5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene conjugated side chain functionalized benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b’]dithiophene (BDT) units. Methyl, ethyl, and n-hexyl are used as the 4-alkyl groups to afford polymer PMT49, PET52, and PHT53, respectively. It is found that the introduction of the 4-alkyl group affords lower energy levels, and the lowering degree increases with alkyl chain length, thus leading to an increase of VOCs in PSCs. The charge mobilities for the pristine polymer films are sequentially reduced with the length of 4-alkyl groups, but PMT49 exhibits the most balanced charge mobility in blend films. Morphological studies reveal that the PMT49 blend film shows better active layer morphology with smaller domain size and little decrease of domain purity than other alkyl group modified polymers. As a result, the PMT49 devices exhibit the highest PCE, delivering an average efficiency of 12.0% in toluene-processed devices with the ITIC acceptor. Furthermore, the 5-(2-ethylhexythio)-4-methylthiophene functionalized polymer PMT50 delivers an impressing average PCE of 15.1% in Y6(BO)17,21 based PSCs processed from 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB), compared with 12.8% of the PEHTT devices without the methyl group.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Materials and synthesis
BDT monomers containing 4-alkyl-5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene conjugated side chains were prepared by lithiation of 3-alkyl-2-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene and then reaction with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-7,8-dione. The BDT based organotin monomers were further polycondensed with 5-(2-ethylhexyl)-1,3-bis(3-octylthieno[3,2-b]thiophen-5-yl)-5H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (tt-TPD) monomers to yield the target polymers. Detailed synthetic information is given in the ESI.† PTh37 is the control polymer without 4-alkyl group functionalization. PMT49, PET52, and PHT53 are polymers with methyl, ethyl, and n-hexyl functionalization on the 4-position of conjugated thiophene side chains, respectively (Scheme 1). The molecular weight increases with the alkyl group length (Table 1) due to the increased solubility with 4-alkyl group functionalization.

2.2 Absorption spectra and energy levels

Fig. 1a shows the absorption spectra of the polymers and ITIC in film. The absorption half maximum of the polymers ranges from 500 to 640 nm, which can complement the absorption of the ITIC acceptor, realizing broad photoresponse. In both solution and film, the polymer absorption edge blue-shifts slightly along with the elongation of the 4-alkyl group (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1, ESI†). The optical bandgaps are 1.86, 1.88, 1.90 and 1.89 eV for PTh37, PMT49, PET52 and PHT53, respectively (Table 1). The introduction of additional 4-alkyl groups affords negligible impact on the bandgaps of the polymers. Comparing the absorption peaks located at around 604 and 562 nm, it is noticed that the ε604/ε562 absorption peak ratio increases along with the length of the 4-alkyl groups, suggesting enhanced intermolecular interactions with alkyl modifications. Notably, the ε604/ε562 peak ratio for PHT53 is dramatically higher than those of other counterparts, which may arise from the higher molecular weight of PHT53 (Table 1). The temperature-dependent UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured to study the polymer interactions in solution (Fig. S2, ESI†). It is found that PMT49 exhibits the most noticeable vibronic peak at longer wavelength at 110 °C. This result may suggest the strongest interchain interaction in PMT49, which is beneficial for the photovoltaic performance. When blended with ITIC, the active layers exhibit broad absorbance in the visible and near-infrared region (Fig. S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  (a) Normalized film absorption spectra and (b) energy levels of pristine PTh37, PMT49, PET52, PHT53 and ITIC. The films were spin-coated from toluene solution. 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to determine the energy levels from polymer films deposited on the glassy carbon electrode. The ionization potential (IP) level is determined from the oxidation onset, while the electron affinity (EA) level is determined from the reduction onset. The significant difference of IP levels and the EA levels between the polymeric donors and ITIC suggests sufficient energy level offsets for photo-induced hole transfer (PHT) and photo-induced electron transfer (PET).49–52 Interestingly, the 4-alkyl modification simultaneously lowers the IP and EA levels (Fig. 1b and Table 1). By introducing the 4-methyl group in the conjugated thiophene side chain, the IP and EA levels of PMT49 are lowered by ∼0.13 eV when compared with PTh37. The medium bandgaps and suitable energy levels of the polymers make them good candidates for matching low bandgap FREAs to construct efficient PSCs.
2.3 Photovoltaic performance
PSCs were fabricated with the conventional structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Ag. The J–V curves and EQE plots are shown in Fig. 2 and the detailed data are summarized in Table 2. To avoid the use of highly toxic and carcinogenic chlorinated solvents, such as chloroform and chlorobenzene, the active layers are prepared by spin-coating from toluene solutions with 1% diphenyl ether (DPE) as the processing additive. The results show that the methylated polymer PMT49 presents the best performance when blending with ITIC, delivering an average PCE of 12.0%, comparing with 10.6%, 9.68% and 7.85% for PTh37, PET52 and PHT53 devices. The champion device of PMT49:ITIC delivers a PCE of 12.1%, with VOC = 0.970 V, JSC = 18.52 mA cm−2 and FF = 67.4%. Due to sequentially lowering IP levels, the VOC increases from 0.927 V for PTh37:ITIC to 1.010 V for PHT53:ITIC. The short-circuit current density (JSC) increases from 17.63 mA cm−2 for PTh37:ITIC to 18.52 mA cm−2 for PMT49:ITIC, and then substantially decreases to 15.74 mA cm−2 for PET52:ITIC and 13.69 mA cm−2 for PHT53:ITIC. The JSCs are further confirmed by external quantum efficiency (EQE), as shown in Fig. 2b and Table 2. Compared with PTh37:ITIC, the FF slightly increases for PMT49:ITIC, but rapidly drops in PET52:ITIC and PHT53:ITIC (Table 2).

2.4 Charge separation and mobility
Photoluminescence spectra were characterized to study the photo-induced charge transfer between the polymers and ITIC (Fig. S4, ESI†). Strong photoluminescence is observed in pristine polymer films, but it is almost quenched in their blends with ITIC. 98% quenching ratio is estimated in the PMT49:ITIC blend, while relatively lower quenching ratios of around 94% are observed for PTh37:ITIC, PET52:ITIC and PHT53:ITIC blends. The higher quenching ratio suggests more efficient exciton dissociation and may partially account for the highest JSC and performance in PMT49:ITIC devices.
Hole-only devices and electron-only devices were fabricated to study the charge mobility of both the pristine polymers and their blends with ITIC (Fig. 3, Fig. S5 (ESI†) and Table 3). The hole mobility of pristine polymer film ranges from 2 × 10−3 to 4.13 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and it is found that alkylation sequentially decreases the hole mobility (Fig. S5, ESI†). In blend films, the hole mobility difference is smaller with 4-alkyl modification (Table 3). A substantial drop of electron mobilities is observed in PET52:ITIC and PHT53:ITIC when compared with PMT49:ITIC (Table 3). As a result, most balanced hole/electron transport is achieved in PMT49:ITIC (μh/μe = 3.72), compared with those of PTh37:ITIC, PET52:ITIC and PHT53:ITIC. The higher and more balanced charge mobility might explain the improved FF in PMT49:ITIC based PSCs, indicating the optimized modulation effects of methylation.

2.5 Morphological analysis
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied to study the morphology of the blends (Fig. 4). Generally, blend films processed from toluene could afford uniform and smooth morphology. The 4-alkyl group functionalization in the polymeric donors decreases the root mean square roughness (RRMS).
 Fig. 4  AFM topography images of (a) PTh37:ITIC, (b) PMT49:ITIC, (c) PET52:ITIC, and (d) PHT53:ITIC blend films processed from Tol + 1%DPE. 
The morphology is further studied using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Fig. 5). It is observed that all four blends exhibit uniform and fine morphology. The TEM result is consistent with the AFM measurement.
 Fig. 5  TEM images of (a) PTh37:ITIC, (b) PMT49:ITIC, (c) PET52:ITIC, and (d) PHT53:ITIC blend films processed from Tol + 1%DPE. 
To further understand the morphology, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) studies were performed to investigate the molecular orientation and packing in the blend films, and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) was performed to study the donor–acceptor phase separation (Fig. 6 and Table 4).53–57 The out-of-plane and in-plane line cuts and the 2D GIWAXS patterns are shown in Fig. 6a and b. Due to the similarity in chemical structures, all the four blend films present similar packing characteristics. For PTh37:ITIC, the diffraction peak is located at 1.63 Å−1, corresponding to d = 3.85 Å. 4-Alkyl functionalization induces slightly larger d-spacing, for example, the diffraction peak was measured to be 1.62 Å−1 for PMT49:ITIC, corresponding to a d-spacing value of 3.88 Å (Table 4). These results indicate that longer alkyl groups induce larger π–π stacking distance in the blend films. Meanwhile, coherence length (CL) values calculated via the Scherrer equation58 show crystal size enhancement with increasing alkyl size. Furthermore, RSoXS data reveal a dramatically lower domain size of 13.1 nm for methylated polymer PMT49 with a large contrast photon energy of 285.2 eV, which is close to the ideal exciton diffusion length of about 10 nm.26 Additionally, RSoXS results also indicate small influence of the methyl unit on the domain purity, while longer alkyl groups, such as ethyl and hexyl units, induce markedly reduced domain purity of the resulting blends with ITIC (Fig. 6c and Table 4).

2.6 PSCs with lower bandgap FREAs
To improve PCE, we further studied PSCs with lower bandgap FREAs. PMT49 is further mixed with Y6,17 an FREA with a lower bandgap than ITIC and superior absorption for higher photocurrents. The J–V curve and the EQE plot for PMT49:Y6 are shown in Fig. 7 and the photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 5 and Table S1 (ESI†). PMT49:Y6 achieves the best performance at a blend ratio of 1:1.2 (w/w), showing an average PCE of 14.0%. The photovoltaic performance is limited due to the relatively lower VOC of 0.810 V.

4-Methyl functionalization is further applied in a 5-(2-ethylhexylthio)thiophene functionalized polymer PMT50 (Scheme 1), aiming to combine the synergistic effect of methylation in the 4-position and thiolation in the 5-position of the conjugated thiophene side chains. PMT50 was prepared by a similar method to that used for PEHTT but replacing 2-(2-ethylhexylthio)thiophene with 2-(2-ethylhexylthio)-3-methylthiophene.48
UV-vis absorption spectra show that methylated polymer PMT50 exhibits a stronger intermolecular π–π interaction compared with control polymer PEHTT, and methylation induces negligible impact on the bandgap (Fig. S6, ESI†). Both PMT50 and PEHTT films present an absorption peak at around 610 nm and a similar absorption onset at ∼659 nm, indicating a similar bandgap of 1.88 eV. On the energy level, methyl functionalization endows PMT50 with an ∼0.1 eV deeper IP level than the control polymer PEHTT: −5.44/−3.48 eV for PMT50 versus −5.35/−3.39 eV for PEHTT (IP/EA).
Using a modified Y6 derivative Y6(BO) with longer 2-butyloctyl groups on N-positions as the acceptor, PSCs were also prepared in the conventional architecture. The active layer was spin-coated from 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB) with 0.5% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as the additive. The J–V curves and EQE plots are shown in Fig. 7. Benefiting from the deeper IP level, the PMT50 device shows a slightly higher VOC (0.84 V) than the control PEHTT device (0.83 V) (Table 5). Both PMT50:Y6(BO) and PEHTT:Y6(BO) deliver JSCs of over 25 mA cm−2, mainly due to the superior absorption of Y6(BO) in the near-infrared region. Compared with the PEHTT:Y6(BO) PSCs, the enhancement of FF (14%) and JSC (4%) in the PMT50:Y6(BO) PSCs could mainly account for the PCE enhancement (17%), leading to an average PCE of 15.1%. It is found that the solubility of PMT50 (∼15 mg mL−1) in TMB is higher than that of PEHTT (∼13 mg mL−1). The increased solubility can favor better blend film morphology as revealed in the PMT49 case.

In conclusion, alkyl groups are introduced in the 4-position of the 5-alkylthiophene side chains to fine-tune the properties of polymeric donors. Compared to the control polymer PTh37 without an alkyl group in the 4-position, the alkylated polymers exhibit sequentially lowered IP levels, thus leading to higher VOC in PSCs. In addition, as the length of 4-alkyl groups increases, the hole mobilities of the pristine polymer film sequentially decreases. However, PMT49 shows the most balanced charge mobilities in blend films. Morphology characterization indicates that PMT49:ITIC shows smaller domain size with little decrease in domain purity than other alkyl group modified polymers. As a result, the PMT49:ITIC based PSCs present an average PCE of 12.0% when processed from toluene. In addition, the 5-(2-ethylhexythioether)-4-methylthiophene functionalized polymer PMT50 with Y6(BO) as the acceptor offers an impressing average PCE of 15.1% processed from 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, which is among the highest of PSCs processed from non-chlorinated solvents reported to date. This work demonstrates that the introduction of a 4-methyl group in the conjugated thiophene side chain is an effective fine-tuning method for conjugated polymers, which allows for the fabrication of efficient PSCs processed from non-chlorinated solvents.
