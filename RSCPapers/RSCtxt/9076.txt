    , Accepted 16th October 2017First published on 16th October 2017AbstractMXenes are attracting much attention as electrode materials due to their excellent energy storage properties and good electrical conductivity. Here a carbonized derivative of Ti3C2 (one representative MXene material), a Ti3C4 monolayer, is designed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the geometric and electronic properties, dynamic stability, and Li/Na storage capability of Ti3C4. The Ti3C4 monolayer is proved to be a structurally stable material showing the nature of the metal with C2 dimers rather than the individual C atom. Moreover, the Ti3C4 monolayer exhibits a low diffusion barrier and high storage capacity (up to Ti3C4Na4 stoichiometry) in Na ion batteries (NIBs) compared with Li ion batteries (LIBs). Its superior properties, such as good electronic conductivity, fast Na diffusion, low open circuit voltage (OCV), and high theoretical Na storage capacity, make the Ti3C4 monolayer a promising anode material for NIBs. More importantly, similar to MXene Ti3C2, new M3C4 monolayers with C2 dimers can be formed by replacing M with other transition metal elements, and the properties of these monolayers are worthy of further study.
Introduction
Energy storage and conversion systems are important strategies for the efficient use of renewable energy sources (such as wind energy, solar energy) in our society. Among different energy storage systems, batteries have compact size and high efficiency performance.1,2 Thus LIBs have attracted the most attention since their first introduction by Sony in 1991, because of their high energy and power densities, wide voltage window, and design flexibility.3 However, the increasing demand for lithium associated with new and large-scale applications makes the implementation difficult and very costly as it is not a naturally abundant element, and Li scarcity can be a future problem.4 Therefore, batteries utilizing other metal ions are needed.5 Since Na is more abundant and cheaper than Li, NIBs can be a good candidate to replace LIBs in the future.6,7 However, more improvements are still needed for NIBs to get to real world applications. The challenges involve finding suitable electrolytes and host materials as electrodes for NIB systems.8,9
MXenes, a newly discovered family of two-dimensional materials, are attracting much attention as electrode materials due to their excellent energy storage properties and good electrical conductivity.10–14 Their phases have the same type of structure, Mn+1XnTx (n = 1, 2, 3), where M can be a transition metal, X is carbon (C) or nitrogen (N), and Tx represents surface functional groups (−O, −OH, and −F).15 MXenes can be produced by etching out the A atom layers from MAX phases (more than 70 pure MAX phases have been reported).16 Because of the differences in character and relative strengths of M–A compared with the M–X bonds, the A layers can be selectively removed using hydrofluoric acid (HF), NH4HF2, or an acidic solution of fluoride salts (such as LiF in HCl).17,18 In this process, the A atoms are replaced by −O, −OH, and/or −F terminal groups. Recent density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experiments indicated that the energy storage capacities of MXenes were found to strongly depend on the nature of surface terminal groups.19–27
It is noteworthy that an experiment group reported the preparation of water-soluble monolayer Ti3C2 MXene quantum dots (MQDs) through a facile hydrothermal method, and they found that the surface of Ti3C2 MQDs may have some amorphous carbon dots.28 Meanwhile, inspired by an earlier experiment by Wang and Cheng who observed an intense peak for a Ti13C22− cluster and a Ti8C12 cage,29 Wang et al. reported a series of TimCn (m ≤ n) systems having high Li storage capacity by DFT prediction.30,31 Thus, we think that it is necessary to design a new type of metal carbide sheet where the metal atoms are less than carbon based on the MXene structure. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical study of a 2D MXene-like structure Ti3C4 monolayer through a carbonized Ti3C2 structure. Such a monolayer can not only have improved chemical stability, but also have different properties due to the change in the binding mode, with the carbon atoms forming C2 dimers in the Ti3C4 monolayer. The calculated results reveal that the Ti3C4monolayer is not only dynamically stable, but also metallic with outstanding Na storage capacity compared with its Li storage capacity. Similar to MXene Ti3C2, the Ti in Ti3C4 could also be replaced with other transition metal elements, thus we can expect that the new type of 2D metal carbides, M3C4, will have better performance.
Methods
Our DFT calculations are performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).32 We use the frozen-core projector augmented wave approach to describe the interaction between the core and valence electrons. To optimize the geometric structures, the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)33,34 with van der Waals (vdW) correction DFT-D2 proposed by Grimme is chosen due to its good description of long-range vdW interactions.35 The energy cutoff is set to be 500 eV. A Monkhorst–Pack mesh of 12 × 12 × 1 and 4 × 4 × 1 k-points is used to sample the two-dimensional Brillouin zone for the unit cell and super-cell calculations, respectively. A unit cell with Lz = 30 Å (a vacuum space of about 23 Å) in a direction perpendicular to the monolayer is used to avoid virtual interactions. All geometric structures are fully relaxed until the convergence criteria of force and energy are 0.02 eV Å−1 and less than 10−5 eV, respectively. To check the dynamic stability, we use density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) to calculate the force constants. The Phonopy code is used to calculate the vibrational spectra.36,37 A charge differential analysis is carried out to study the charge redistribution and transfer quantitatively. By using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method,38 we calculate the diffusion energy barrier and minimum energy diffusion pathway of Li and Na on the Ti3C4 monolayer. Additionally, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are carried out to examine the multilayered adsorption behavior of Li/Na on the Ti3C4 monolayer at 800 K with a time step of 0.5 fs.
Results and discussion
Structure and stability properties
First, we focused on the structural properties of the Ti3C2 monolayer and its carbonized derivatives (denoted as Ti3C4). As a starting point of geometry optimization, an atomic model of the Ti3C2 monolayer is constructed from the Ti3AlC2 phase. The Ti3C2 monolayer is built up of quintuple layers stacked in a sequence of Ti(2)–C(1)–Ti(1)–C(1)–Ti(2), which can be described as three Ti-atomic layers being inter-cleaved with two C-atomic layers forming edge-shared Ti6C octahedra (Fig. 1a). The carbonized Ti3C2 monolayer is constructed by saturating the under-coordinated surface Ti(2) atoms with C groups. Herein, two major possible configurations of C termination modes are considered: for type I (Fig. 1b), all the C groups are located above the hollow sites between three neighboring C(1) atoms or point directly toward the Ti(1) atoms; for type II (Fig. 1c), all the C groups are oriented above the topmost sites of C(1) atoms on both sides of the Ti3C2 layer. The structural relaxations of the Ti3C2 and (I-, II-) Ti3C4 monolayers have well preserved the geometrical integrity of the original layers.

The cyan balls represent Ti atoms and grey balls represent C atoms. 
Compared with the bare Ti3C2 monolayer with lattice constants a = b = 3.10 Å, thickness d = 4.665 Å, Ti(2)–C(1) = 2.059 Å and Ti(1)–C(1) = 2.218 Å, after C saturation, the I-Ti3C4 monolayer has smaller parameters (a = b = 3.07 Å) and larger thickness (d = 7.261 Å), with Ti(2)–C(1) = 2.180 Å and Ti(1)–C(1) = 2.166 Å; meanwhile Ti(2)–C(2) = 2.091 Å. On the other hand, the II-Ti3C4 monolayer has larger parameters (a = b = 3.37 Å) and thickness (d = 5.557 Å), with Ti(2)–C(1) = 2.225 Å and Ti(1)–C(1) = 2.315 Å; meanwhile Ti(2)–C(2) = 1.996 Å. The difference between I-Ti3C4 and II-Ti3C4 is that the carbon atoms are atomically bonded to their neighboring TM atoms with the C–C distance from 2.971 to 3.057 Å in I-Ti3C4, while the C(2)–C(1) distance is only 1.524 Å in II-Ti3C4, showing a double bond character and implying that the carbon atoms exist in the form of C2 dimers. Meanwhile, all the three structures Ti3C2, I-Ti3C4 and II-Ti3C4 have the same symmetry group PM1.
The structural stability of the different Ti3C4 configurations can be estimated by comparing their relative total energies; II-Ti3C4 is energetically lower than I-Ti3C4 by about 3.34 eV per unit cell. This suggests that the C groups tend to attach above the topmost sites of C(1) atoms on the Ti3C2 layer, and the lowest structural stability of the type II configuration should be ascribed to the formation of a C2 dimer between the C group and the underneath carbon atoms. Moreover, we investigated the dynamic stability of I-Ti3C4 and II-Ti3C4 monolayers through phonon dispersion calculations. The phonon frequencies and phonon density of states (DOS) are calculated with high accuracy to examine the dynamic stability. The calculated results are summarized in Fig. 2. We can see that the I-Ti3C4 monolayer is dynamically unstable as obvious negative frequencies exist in the entire Brillouin zone, while the II-Ti3C4 monolayer is dynamically stable as no imaginary frequencies exist in the entire Brillouin zone. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the phonon spectra exhibit no imaginary frequency, and the optical and acoustical branches are well separated. The stretching mode of the C–C bonds (C2) corresponds to the two highest optical branches reaching up to 866 cm−1 (26 THz), which is lower than that of the Ti8C12 cluster (1360 cm−1)39 due to the different bond orders. In this respect, we conclude that the structure of the II-Ti3C4 monolayer is dynamically stable. Furthermore, we calculated the formation energy of the II-Ti3C4 monolayer using the following equation: EF = ETi3C4 − ETi3C2 − 2EC(1)where EF is the formation energy, ETi3C4 and ETi3C2 are the energies of the II-Ti3C4 monolayer and the Ti3C2monolayer, and EC is the energy of per carbon atom by three defined systems which are pure graphene, graphene with void by 5.5% and 12.5% carbon atom point defects respectively (the model of 5.5% and 12.5% point defects graphene are 3 × 3 and 2 × 2 supercells by one carbon atom defect). The calculated formation energies are 1.80 eV, 0.87 eV and −0.22 eV per unit cell, indicating that the II-Ti3C4 monolayer can be formed by the Ti3C2 monolayer and defective graphene. Furthermore, we also performed the same calculations for unsaturated graphene quantum dots and nanoribbons and the results show that they can also be used as a precursor to obtain Ti3C4. It should be noted that the unsaturated carbon atoms, which cannot be avoided in experiments, can be well connected with the Ti3C2 to form the C2 structure, and thus promote the formation of the Ti3C4 structure. From these phonon spectra and formation energy calculations, we conclude that the II-Ti3C4 monolayer is structurally stable and is promising to be realized in experiment. Hereafter only the stable conformer II-Ti3C4 will be considered.

Electronic band structures
To study the electronic properties, we calculate the band structure of the Ti3C4 monolayer, and the results are plotted in Fig. 3(a). Ti3C4 is found to be metallic as the partially occupied bands, in red, blue and cyan, cross the Fermi level in the Brillouin zone. The metallic nature is further confirmed by using the more accurate HSE06 functional.40 In addition, we find that the Ti3C4 monolayer has no spin polarization. To visualize the charge distribution, we plot the band-decomposed charge density isosurfaces for the red, blue and cyan bands of the band structure as shown in Fig. 3(b), which clearly show the main contribution to the charge density of each band. The band-decomposed charge densities of the red band clearly show the characteristics of Ti-3dz2 orbitals, while both the blue and cyan bands have the feature of Ti-3d, C-2s and 2p hybrid orbitals. Furthermore, we also calculate the band-decomposed charge density isosurfaces of the section across the Fermi level (the box section) as shown in Fig. 3(c), indicating that the metallic nature of Ti3C4 originates from the electrons in Ti-3dz2 orbitals and hybridization of Ti-3d and C-2p states. Above all, orbital analysis suggests that the bands near the Fermi level are dominated by the Ti-3d orbitals, meanwhile the C-2s and 2p orbitals also make large contributions to the observed metallic nature through hybridization with the Ti-3d states.

Adsorption and diffusion of Li and Na atoms on theTi3C4 monolayer
The metallic nature of Ti3C4 provides an intrinsic advantage in electrical conductivity as compared to semiconducting or insulating transition-metal oxides and TMD layers, so it may be used as an electrode material. Therefore, after gaining a thorough understanding of the basic electronic properties of Ti3C4, we subsequently extended our computations to the adsorption and diffusion behaviours of Li and Na ions on Ti3C4 structures. Considering that Ti3C4 possesses a higher carbon content as compared to Ti3C2, we expect that this monolayer can have a better Li and Na storage capacity. To determine the preferable adsorption site of Li and Na on the Ti3C4 monolayer, we use a 3 × 3 super-cell and deposit one Li or Na atom on different sites; the most favorable adsorption configurations can be identified by comparing their adsorption energies. Three typical adsorption configurations with high structural symmetry, labeled CI, CII and CIII, are considered, as shown in Fig. 4 for Li and Na ions, where CI is the hollow site of the three neighboring C(2) atoms and top of the Ti(1) site; CII is the hollow site of the three neighboring C(2) atoms and top of the Ti(2) site; CIII is the on-top site of the C(2) atom that is in between the three neighboring Ti(2) atoms. Full geometry optimizations and total energy calculations are performed to identify their relative stability in terms of Li and Na adsorption. For Li adsorption, CI is found to be the lowest energy configuration with an energy of −1.74 eV, which is lower than those of CII (−1.01 eV) and CIII (−0.88 eV), as shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c), suggesting that the Li atom prefers to occupy the hollow site of the three neighboring C(2) atoms and top of the Ti(1) site on the Ti3C4 monolayer. On the other hand, the calculated adsorption energies for Na manifest similar features, that is, the adsorption energy of CI is −1.49 eV lower than those of CII (−1.14 eV) and CIII (−0.88 eV) as shown in Fig. 4(d)–(f).

To evaluate the potential application of the Ti3C4 monolayer as an anode material for battery electrodes, we estimate the diffusion behavior of Li and Na atoms on the surface of the Ti3C4 monolayer using the CI-NEB method. As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), we investigate the possible diffusion paths of the Li and Na atoms on the Ti3C4 monolayer. We consider three trial diffusion paths denoted as P1, P2 and P3 that connect the two neighboring most preferable adsorption sites: for path 1, the Li ion is designed to move along the pathway from the site on top of Ti(1) atoms to the one on top of Ti(2) atoms and then to the top of the nearest neighboring Ti(1) atoms (top Ti(1) → top Ti(2) → top Ti(1)); for path 2, the Li ion is allowed to move directly to the nearest neighboring site in a one-step linear path (top Ti(1) → top Ti(1)); for path 3, the Li ion is moved along the pathway from top Ti(1) → top C(2) → top Ti(1). The corresponding diffusion energy profiles along the optimized pathway for Li and Na are shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), respectively.
 Fig. 5  (a and b) Considered migration paths of Li and Na diffusion on the Ti3C4 monolayer; and (c and d) the corresponding diffusion energy barrier profiles. 
For the Li atom, all three pathways have high diffusion barriers, with values of 0.74 eV, 0.76 eV and 0.85eV for the P1, P2 and P3 diffusion paths, respectively. These values are higher than that of most 2D materials, such as MoS2 (0.25 eV),41 graphene (0.33 eV),42 and TiO2-based polymorphs (about 0.65 eV).43 In the case of the Na atom, P1 is found to have the lowest diffusion barrier of 0.35 eV. When Na ions diffuse along P2, the energy barrier is similar to that of P1 (0.35 eV) and the shortest diffusion length of 3.37 Å is obtained, while the energy barrier is 0.60 eV when Na ions diffuse along P3, which is much larger than that of P1 or P2. Above all, it is clear that both paths I and II are the possible routes for Na ion diffusion, which is beneficial for an Na electrode material. In addition, if the lengths of paths I and II are taken into account, P2 will be more favorable than P1 because it is a more shorter diffusion path. In summary, the diffusion barrier for Na (0.35 eV) is lower than that for Li (0.74 eV), which ensures high Na diffusion mobility on the surface of the Ti3C4 monolayer. From the calculated diffusion barriers, excellent charge–discharge rates can be expected for the Ti3C4 monolayer when it is used as an electrode for Na-ion batteries.
Theoretical open circuit voltage and storage capacity of the Ti3C4 monolayer
After investigating the adsorption site and the diffusion path, we studied the adsorption of Li and Na with high concentration. To explore the maximum storage capacity for Li and Na, we consider the adsorption on both sides of the Ti3C4 monolayer. A 3 × 3 supercell of the Ti3C4 monolayer was adopted in our calculations. The charge–discharge process of the Ti3C4 monolayer can be described as the common half-cell reaction vs. A/A+: Ti3C4 + xA+ + xe− = Ti3C4A(2)where A represents the alkali element Li or Na. We first evaluated the maximum storage capacities of Li and Na on the Ti3C4 monolayer. As mentioned above, the most stable adsorption site for Li and Na is located above the hollow site of the three neighboring carbon atoms and top of the Ti(1) site on the Ti3C4 monolayer; therefore, we applied the first Li/Na intercalation layer at the hollow site. For the second layer, we examined all the possibilities by successively assigning the ad-atoms at the other sites to determine the most stable site. We investigated the Li/Na storage performance of the Ti3C4 monolayer by calculating the average adsorption energy (Eave) layer by layer, which is defined as: Eave = (ETi3C4A18n − ETi3C4A18(n−1) − 18EA)/18(3)where ETi3C4A18n and ETi3C4A18(n−1) are the total energies of Ti3C4 with n and n − 1 adsorption layers, respectively, EA represents the energy per atom in bulk Li or Na, and the number “18” corresponds to eighteen ad-atoms for each layer. For the first adsorption layer, the calculated average adsorption energy is −1.47 eV per atom for Li, and −0.90 eV per atom for Na. These large negative adsorption energies ensure good intercalation stability of Li/Na ions on the Ti3C4 monolayer. For the second adsorption layer, we found that the configurations with ad-atoms at the CIII site (see Fig. 4(c) and (f)) possess the lowest average adsorption energies, which were calculated to be 0.15 eV per atom for Li and −0.03 eV per atom for Na. Obviously, only the second layer of Na is energetically stable, while that of Li is unstable. It should be noted that the second layer of Na possesses a low absorption energy (−0.03 eV per atom), indicating a weak multi-layered adsorption. However, this value is comparable to those of typical electrode materials, such as the adsorption energies of Na on Ca2N (−0.003 eV per atom) and GeS (−0.02 eV per atom), and Li on Nb2C (−0.02 eV per atom) and Mo2C (−0.01 eV per atom).44 Therefore, it is practical to use this value to estimate the theoretical maximum capacity. Considering the absorption energy, the Ti3C4 monolayer can accommodate up to one layer of Li and two layers of Na, respectively.
In order to clarify the physical origin of the diverse adsorption behaviors of Li and Na atoms on the Ti3C4 monolayer, first we calculate the charge density difference of Ti3C4Li2/Ti3C4Na2 by subtracting the electronic charge of Ti3C4Li2/Ti3C4Na2 from those of the Ti3C4 monolayer and one Li/Na layer (Fig. 6a and c). The red region indicates charge accumulation, and the blue region represents charge depletion. The planar-averaged charge density difference along the Z-direction is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†); the positive values represent the electron depletion, and the negative values indicate the electron accumulation. Obviously, the change at the interface suggests that some electrons transfer from the Ti3C4 monolayer to the Li/Na layer. Next, using the same definition, we calculate the charge density difference of Ti3C4Li4/Ti3C4Na4 by subtracting the electronic charge of Ti3C4Li4/Ti3C4Na4 from those of Ti3C4Li2/Ti3C4Na2 and the extra Li/Na layer (Fig. 6b and d). The change at the interface suggests that some electrons transfer from the extra Li layer to Ti3C4Li2, and in contrast, some electrons transfer from the Ti3C4Na2 to the extra Na layer. To understand the origin of the fact that the Ti3C4 monolayer can accommodate up to two layers of Na, the relative energies with respect to the lowest energy electrically neutral system of the Li/Na monolayer and bilayer by adding and subtracting one electron are calculated (Table S1, ESI†). We can see that the addition of electrons makes the energy of the system lower and the energy of the system with electrons removed is higher. This effectively explains why the extra Li with electron depletion is not adsorbed, while the extra Na with electron accumulation can be adsorbed.
 Fig. 6  The different charge transfer processes of (a) Ti3C4Li2 monolayer, (b) Ti3C4Li2 with an extra Li layer, (c) Ti3C4Na2 monolayer and (d) Ti3C4Na2 with an extra Na layer, respectively. The isovalue is 0.004 e Å−3. 
Meanwhile, we display the electron localization functions (ELF) of the (110) section of the Ti3C4 monolayer with one and two layers of (a and b) Li and (c and d) Na as shown in Fig. 7. For the first layer, the electrons over the Na layer form a negatively charged cloud while there is no negatively charged cloud over the Li layer; these can be visualized by the calculated electron localization functions (ELF) (Fig. 7a and c). For the second layer, we found a sufficient concentration of electrons between Li atoms in the extra layer of the ELF graph (see Fig. 7b), indicating a strong bonding between them. As a result, the extra layer of Li atoms is more likely to form Li clusters rather than adsorbing on the Ti3C4 monolayer. Unlike the Li system, in the ELF graph of Na (see Fig. 7d), it is indicated that the extra Na layer is able to bind with the Ti3C4 monolayer, as the negatively charged environment is favorable to the adsorption of the extra Na layer, which gives rise to the possibility of multi-layered adsorption behavior for Na on the Ti3C4 monolayer. On the other hand, we calculate the electron localization functions (ELF) of the individual Li/Na bilayer as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†); we can see that the electron localization of Li bilayer is mainly the interlayer interaction and the Na bilayer is the inner interaction of each layer. These ELFs exhibit different distributions compared with the Li/Na bilayer of the Ti3C4Li4/Ti3C4Na4 system.

Finally, AIMD simulations were performed to check why multi-layered adsorption of ions on the Ti3C4 monolayer can only be observed for Na and not for Li. The snapshots of the AIMD simulations are shown in Fig. 8. After running 10000 steps at 800 K, we can see that the Li atoms of the extra layer become disorganized and no obvious layered structure can be observed as shown in Fig. 8a, indicating that the extra layer of Li atoms is more likely to form Li clusters. This reveals the weak interaction of the second layer Li atoms with Ti3C4. In contrast, the Na atoms of all layers are organized to maintain an orderly layered structure as shown in Fig. 8b, indicating that the extra layer of Na atoms is favorable to undergo multi-layered adsorption. To sum up, the charge density difference, ELF calculations and AIMD simulations were found to be in good agreement with the calculated adsorption energies of the Li/Na extra layer, indicating that multi-layered adsorption of Na atoms can be realized on the Ti3C4 monolayer.

In the following, we calculate the open circuit voltage (OCV) and the theoretical Li and Na storage capacity of the Ti3C4 monolayer, which are the most crucial parameters in determining the performance of an electrode material. Taking a lithium battery as an example, here, OCV can be directly derived in a rather simple way:30 OCV ≈ (ETi3C4 + xELi − ETi3C4Lix)/x(4)where ETi3C4, ELi, and ETi3C4Lix represent the free energies (total energy at 0 K) of pristine Ti3C4, Li in bcc bulk, and the Li-adsorbed Ti3C4, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum capacity (CM) can be obtained by the following equation: CM = xF/MTi3C4(5)where x represents the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical process, F is the Faraday constant (with a value of 26.8 A h mol−1), and MTi3C4 is the mass of Ti3C4. As mentioned above, the Ti3C4 monolayer can accommodate up to one layer of Li and two layers of Na, corresponding to the chemical stoichiometries of Ti3C4Li2 and Ti3C4Na4, respectively. We obtain the average OCV values, which are 1.47 V for Li, and 0.90 V (one layer) to 0.47 V (double layers) for Na; compared with Li, we find that Na possesses a lower average OCV. Meanwhile, the maximum capacities of Li and Na were calculated to be 280 and 560 mA h g−1, respectively. We can see that the Ti3C4 monolayer is more suitable to serve as an anode material because of its relatively low average OCV (1.47 V vs. Li/Li+ and 0.47 V vs. Na/Na+). In particular, as an anode for NIBs, the theoretical capacity of Ti3C4 (560 mA h g−1) is larger than those of most 2D anode materials, including TMDCs such as MoS2 (146 mA h g−1) and NbS2 (263 mA h g−1),45 MXenes such as Nb2C (271 mA h g−1), and Ti3C2 (320 mA h g−1);46 its theoretical capacity is even larger than that of GeS nanosheets (512 mA h g−1).47 The high Na-ion capacity in the Ti3C4 monolayer mainly originates from its multi-layered adsorption ability compared with MXenes. The electrochemical properties obtained by DFT calculations highlight the potential of the Ti3C4 monolayer as a high capacity electrode material for NIBs.
Conclusions
In this work, using a Ti3C4 monolayer as an example, which is a carbonized derivative of the Ti3C2 monolayer, we have explored the potential of a new type of 2D transition metal carbide as an electrode material for metal ion batteries by DFT calculations. Ti3C4 has no exposed metal atoms showing better chemical stability compared to the MXene Ti3C2 monolayer. We demonstrated that the Ti3C4 monolayer is not only structurally stable, but also exhibits a metallic band structure. The Ti3C4 monolayer has negative adsorption energies for Li and Na atoms; meanwhile, the most energetically favorable diffusion pathways of Li and Na atoms were identified. The results indicate that the Ti3C4 monolayer can possess good charge–discharge rates as an electrode since Na has a lower diffusion barrier than the Li atom. Considering the absorption energy, the Ti3C4 monolayer can accommodate up to one layer of Li and two layers of Na, respectively. In addition, the charge density difference, ELF calculations and AIMD simulations were found to be in good agreement with the calculated adsorption energies of the extra layer of Li/Na atoms. Considering the calculated average OCV and CM values, our work reveals that the Ti3C4 monolayer shows multi-layered adsorption ability for Na, and the theoretical Na-ion capacity (560 mA h g−1) is larger than those of typical 2D anode materials, such as MoS2 and most MXenes. Furthermore, in addition to the 2D metal carbide family, our results suggest that many other M3C4 monolayers also have the potential as a high storage performance battery electrode.
