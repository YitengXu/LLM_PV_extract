    , Accepted 2nd February 2015First published on 3rd February 2015AbstractA nano-grid structure of perovskite SrTiO3 NWs is developed for a novel electron transport layer in inverted polymer solar cells. Due to the excellent charge transporting properties of the SrTiO3 nano-grid structure, the device employing this nanostructure showed ∼32% enhanced photovoltaic performance, compared to the solar cell using a TiO2 thin film.
The bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) consisting of conjugated polymers (photo-active polymers, electron donors) and fullerene derivatives (electron acceptors) have received a lot of attention as the next generation energy conversion system due to their outstanding advantages such as light weight, low cost and simple fabrication in large area.1,2 However, BHJ–PSCs still need improvement in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term air stability for commercialization.3–6 To overcome these issues, the inverted PSCs have been proposed and developed through the modification and optimization of the device structure.7,8
As an electron transport layer (ETL) in the inverted PSCs, n-type metal oxides have many beneficial properties such as environmental stability, high transparency, remarkable electron transport and hole blocking. Among the several kinds of n-type metal oxides, especially, TiOx and ZnO have been widely used as ETLs in inverted PSCs.9–13 However, the relative energy level mismatch (∼0.5 eV) between the conduction band energy of n-type metal oxides and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of fullerene derivatives is one of the drawbacks to be solved in order to improve device performance in the inverted PSCs. To reduce the difference between the energy levels, the n-type doping method such as nitrogen14,15 or zirconium16,17 doping into TiO2 is widely used to alter the conduction band energy level. Unfortunately, there is still a weakness from a commercial viewpoint due to the difficulty in controlling the exact doping concentration as well as the price of doping material and processing. Therefore, the development and synthesis of new materials is strongly required, of which the conduction band is located closer to the vacuum level without losing the other excellent properties of n-type metal oxides.
1-Dimensional (1-D) nanostructures such as nanowires (NWs), nanorods, and nanoneedles have attracted a lot of attention in nanoscale opto-electronic devices due to their unique, controllable and multi-functional properties.18–20 In particular, metal oxides having 1-D nanostructures can show excellent properties as an electrode in opto-electronic devices because they could diminish the charge recombination in the photo-active layer through rapid charge transfer along their direct pathway and efficient carrier percolation at the interface.21–24 In this respect, the utilization of n-type metal oxides with 1-D nanostructures as ETLs can be very practical and ideal solutions for realizing highly efficient inverted PSCs.25,26
In this study, the inverted PSCs which employ strontium titanate (SrTiO3) NWs as ETLs were newly introduced and their photovoltaic performances were investigated. SrTiO3 is a cubic structured perovskite crystal which has the ABO3 stoichiometry, but its crystal structure is very similar to that of anatase TiO2. Also, the band-gap energies of both perovskite SrTiO3 and anatase TiO2 are almost the same (approximately 3.2 eV). However, the conduction band of SrTiO3 is located closer to the vacuum level than that of TiO2 by 0.2 eV. This negative shift of the conduction band in SrTiO3 can significantly reduce charge recombination in the photo-active layer with efficient charge extraction from the LUMO level of fullerene derivatives to the conduction band of SrTiO3.27,28 In addition to efficient charge extraction from the photo-active layer, nano-grid structures of metal oxide NWs in the inverted PSCs offer efficient percolating pathways and a large contact area by building an interpenetrated network structure between the photo-active layer and the cathode electrode. The nano-grid structures of TiO2 NWs and SrTiO3 NWs used in this work were synthesized on the cathode electrode via a facile electrospinning method. The inverted PSCs employing the SrTiO3 nano-grid structure as an ETL exhibited significant improvement of power conversion efficiency by 32%, compared to that of the reference cell with a TiO2 thin film (TF) as the ETL.
Electrospinning solution for TiO2 NWs was prepared by chemical synthetic processes. Firstly, 0.375 ml of titanium butoxide was mixed with a solution of acetic acid (0.75 ml) and ethanol (0.75 ml) under stirring in a N2 atmosphere. The mixed solution was then blended with 0.112 g of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) dissolved in 1.875 ml of ethanol. The electrospinning precursor solution for SrTiO3 NWs was also prepared similarly. Firstly, 0.113 g of strontium acetate and 0.188 ml of titanium butoxide were mixed in a solution consisting of 1.5 ml of acetic acid and 1 ml of ethanol under constant stirring at 60 °C in a N2 atmosphere. Herein, the nominal molar ratio of Sr:Ti was adjusted to 1:1. After enough stirring at 60 °C, the precursor solutions were blended with the PVP solution which was homogenously prepared by dissolving 0.108 g of PVP in 1 ml of ethanol. Each mixture solution of TiO2 and SrTiO3 was separately loaded into a plastic syringe equipped with a cut 23 gauge (inner diameter of ca. 0.42 μm) needle made of stainless steel. The needle was connected to a high-voltage supply (DC high voltage generator, CPS-40K03VIT). The indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate coated with metal oxide TF (∼10 nm) via a sol–gel process was loaded on a metallic collector. When applying a high voltage between the syringe needle and the substrate, the electrospun NWs were collected on the substrate. Finally, as-electrospun NWs on the substrates were calcined in a furnace at 500 °C for 3 h in air.
From the FE-SEM images in Fig. 1(a) and (b), it is observed that the synthesized TiO2 NWs and SrTiO3 NWs have ultra-long length (>5 μm) with diameters in the range of 30–70 nm. The nano-grid structures of TiO2 NWs and SrTiO3 NWs were formed on the substrates with the control of NWs density by changing electrospinning conditions. The TEM images in Fig. 1(c) and (d) represent the local structural properties of an individual NW of TiO2 and SrTiO3, respectively. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns showed the diffuse ring patterns with clear spots, indicating both TiO2 NWs and SrTiO3 NWs are polycrystalline structures (insets of Fig. 1(c) and (d)). XRD results in Fig. 1(e) reveal that the electrospun TiO2 NWs and SrTiO3 NWs consist of the anatase TiO2 phase (titanate, JCPDS card no. 86-1157) and the cubic-perovskite SrTiO3 phase (strontium titanate, JCPDS card no. 84-0444), respectively. In order to identify composition elements and relative proportions in both TiO2 NWs and SrTiO3 NWs, atomic elemental analysis was performed by EDX as shown in Fig. S1.† From the EDX spectra, it is confirmed that the electrospun TiO2 NWs and SrTiO3 NWs mainly consist of Sr, Ti, and O elements. The UV/Vis absorption spectra were recorded to study the optical properties of the electrospun NWs. As described above, the absorption patterns of the synthesized TiO2 NWs and SrTiO3 NWs are almost the same with a similar bandgap of 3.64 eV in the visible light range as shown in Fig. 1(f).

Fig. 2(a) shows the schematic illustration of the inverted PSCs which use the ETL consisting of metal oxide (TiO2 or SrTiO3) NWs as the electron extractor and the pathway for electron transport. Firstly, thin and planar film layers of TiO2 or SrTiO3 (ca. 10 nm) were uniformly deposited via a sol–gel process on the ITO substrate in order to prevent hole transport. Next, the nano-grid structures of TiO2 NWs or SrTiO3 NWs were fabricated as ETLs over the thin film layer by electrospinning processes. The poly[3-hexylthiophene](P3HT):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer was spin-coated on the ETL and applied on inverted PSCs as the photo-active layer. Covering the nano-grid structure of NWs with a conjugated polymer film can provide a three-dimensional inorganic–organic connection (i.e., an interpenetrating structure) by infiltrating the blend (P3HT:PCBM) into the nano-grid structure (See Fig. S2 of the ESI†).29–31 This interpenetrating structure increases the contact area between the ETL and the photo-active layer, compared to a simple planar structure. In this inverted PSC structure, the photo-generated charge carriers (holes and electrons) are transported along the percolating pathways to the relevant electrodes as shown in Fig. 2a, in which electrons and holes move toward the cathode (ITO) via the NWs and the anode (Ag/MoO3), respectively. Fig. 2(b) depicts the corresponding energy levels of the materials used in this inverted PSCs. In the energy level diagram of Fig. 2(b), SrTiO3 has a higher conduction band position, compared to TiO2. This can result in efficient electron transporting from LUMO of PCBM to the conduction band of SrTiO3.

To evaluate photovoltaic performance with the different ETL structures such as TiO2 TF, TiO2 TF/NWs and SrTiO3 TF/NWs (See Fig. S3 of the ESI†), inverted PSCs consisting of ITO/n-type metal oxides/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. The photovoltaic performances of the inverted PSCs were evaluated by measuring the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics and IPCE (Fig. 3(a) and (b)). Table 1 summarizes the photovoltaic performances of inverted PSCs with the different ETLs. Also, Fig. S4† presents the statistical analysis of the photovoltaic parameters. The photocurrent (Jsc) obtained from the current–voltage (J–V) graph was calibrated from the IPCE to ensure the accuracy of the measurement. The 1-D nanostructures in photovoltaic devices can induce the better charge transport from the photo-active layer into the electrode because the 1-D nanostructures such as NWs can provide a direct pathway along their longitudinal morphologies at the interfacial connection.32 By taking advantage of the efficient charge transport of NWs, an inverted PSC (device 2) employing the nano-grid structure of TiO2 NWs as the ETL showed a better photovoltaic performance by an increase of photocurrent (Jsc) and Fill factor (FF) than that of an inverted PSC (device 1) using TiO2 TF, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and Table 1. Moreover, it is noticeable that the photovoltaic performance of the inverted PSC (device 3) employing a nano-grid structure of SrTiO3 NWs as the ETL exhibited significant enhancement (∼20%) in the photovoltaic performance, compared with the inverted PSC (device 2) employing a nano-grid structure of TiO2 NWs (Fig. 3(a) and Table 1). It is expected that the main reason for the enhancement of photovoltaic performance in the device 3 is improved electron transporting properties due to the higher electron affinity of SrTiO3, which could be induced from a better energy level match between the PCBM and the metal oxide. Consequently, the device 3 showed ∼32% enhancement in PCE with improving photocurrent (Jsc) and FF compared to that of the reference device (device 1).

Generally, photovoltaic performance, especially photocurrent (Jsc), is directly related to the charge carrier density induced by light absorption in the photo-active layer.33 Therefore, transmittance spectra of the different ETLs and light absorbance spectra of each photo-active layer (P3HT:PCBM), coated on the ETLs, were measured by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy to investigate whether enhancement of photovoltaic performance might have originated from the improvement of the photo-induced charge carrier density (See Fig. S5 of the ESI†). As shown in Fig. S5(a),† the transmittance shapes of the three ETLs are almost same. However, the transmittance intensities of the nano-grid structures made of metal oxide NWs are relatively lower than that of the TF structure in the range of 400 to 500 nm. This is an opposite trend compared to the photovoltaic performances shown in Fig. 3(a) and Table 1. For instance, the device 1 with TiO2 TF as ETL showed a lower photocurrent (Jsc) than those of devices 2 and 3 with nano-grid structures of TiO2 NWs and SrTiO3 NWs in spite of higher light absorption in the photo-active layer as shown in Fig. S5(b) of the ESI.† In addition, the device 3 using the nano-grid structure of SrTiO3 NWs as the ETL shows much higher photovoltaic performance than that of device 2 with the nano-grid structure of TiO2 NWs, even though light absorption of the photo-active layer in devices 2 and 3 is similar as shown in Fig. S5(b).† The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) spectra in Fig. 4(a) show the efficiency of collected carriers per absorbed photon.34 As shown in Fig. 4(a), the inverted PSCs (device 3) employing a SrTiO3 nano-grid structure have the highest IQE value. This result strongly suggests that higher photovoltaic performance of device 3 is attributed to the excellent charge extraction and transporting properties of the SrTiO3 nano-grid structure as the ETL.

The charge transporting properties of the different ETLs in the inverted PSCs were measured and analyzed by electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 4(b) shows Bode plots of EIS in the inverted PSCs with the different ETLs. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the characteristic peak, frequency value at the lowest phase angle, was shifted to a lower frequency range in the order of device 3, device 2 and device 1. Herein, the frequency value of the characteristic peak in Bode plots determined the electron lifetime (τe) in the inverted PSCs using the following equation:  where fcharacteristic is the value of characteristic frequency at the lowest phase angle.35 The calculated τe values are summarized in Table 1. Interestingly, the electron lifetimes at the ETL/polymer interfaces are similarly increasing in correspondence with the improvement of photovoltaic performance in the inverted PSCs with the different ETLs (See Table 1). In particular, device 3 employing the SrTiO3 nano-grid ETL shows two times longer carrier lifetime than that of device 1 employing TiO2 TF ETL. The longer carrier lifetime at the interface indicates the reduction of charge recombination and low resistance at the interface by efficient charge transporting from the photo-active layer to an ETL.36 From the inset of Fig. 3a, the series resistance (Rs) of inverted PSCs with different ETLs was obtained by the slopes of the J–V curve at Voc (near 0.6 V). Rs is determined by the inverse value of the slope at Voc. As expected, device 3 with the SrTiO3 nano-grid structure showed the lowest Rs, compared to that of devices 1 and 2 made of TiO2 TF and the nano-grid structure, respectively. These results imply the beneficial role of the SrTiO3 nano-grid structure on charge extraction and transfer from the high conduction band and the effective electron pathway at the interface between the ETL and the photo-active layer in the inverted PSCs. Therefore, inverted PSCs employing the nano-grid structures of SrTiO3 NWs as an ETL exhibited significant improvement to PCE by enhanced current density and FF, even though the nano-grid structure showed a relatively poor transmittance under visible light.
Conclusions
We have introduced the nano-grid structure of SrTiO3 NWs in inverted PSCs as an ETL to improve the electron extraction and transfer at the interface between inorganic nanostructures and photo-active polymers. The nano-grid structure of SrTiO3 NWs was easily synthesized by the electrospinning method on the cathode electrode. The higher conduction band of SrTiO3 significantly reduced charge recombination of the carriers created in the photo-active layer due to efficient charge extraction from the LUMO level of fullerene derivatives, compared to the TiO2 materials. Moreover, the nano-grid structure of SrTiO3 NWs showed enhanced electron transporting properties by efficient percolating pathways and a large contact area by building an interpenetrated network structure between the photo-active layer and the cathode electrode. As a result, the inverted PSCs employing the SrTiO3 nano-grid structures as effective ETLs showed the enhanced photovoltaic performance by ca. 32%, compared to that of inverted PSCs with TiO2 TF. The novel SrTiO3 ETL system in this study would provide a promising approach to improve the carrier transport properties of various opto-electronic devices.
