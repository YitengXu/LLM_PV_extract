1. Introduction
Flexible dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their light weight, flexibility, low production cost and increasingly potential application value.1–3 Many flexible substrates, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) deposited polyethylene naphthalate (PEN),4 polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic substrate,5 and metal sheet (e.g., Ti foil)6,7 were used to fabricate DSSCs. However, the obtained performance still remains low due to the disadvantages of plastic substrate's poor thermal stability and metal foil being opaque. Metal mesh, particularly titanium (Ti) mesh, which possesses good flexibility, favorable light transparency, electrical conductivity and stable electrochemical activities, is a great potential a candidate for flexible DSSCs substrates.8 To date, much effort has been taken on the synthesis of functionalized semiconductors on metal mesh by various approaches. Hwang et al.9 prepared a flexible DSSC using vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays on Ti mesh by an anodic oxidation method, which exhibited a photovoltaic efficiency of 5.3%. Zou et al.10 synthesized a flexible DSSC based on stainless steel mesh supported TiO2 nanoparticles and gave a conversion performance of 1.49%. Jiang et al.11 reported TiO2 nanoparticles on Cu mesh via a hydrothermal route and achieved a photovoltaic property of 4.73%. Unfortunately, the overall photo to electric conversion efficiency of the flexible DSSC was unsatisfactory, and in order to further enhance the photovoltaic performance, several research studies have been carried out on optimizing the photoanode structures for flexible DSSCs.12,13 Composite nanostructures, which consist of long nanorods (nanowires) trunks and short nanorods (nanoparticles) branches,14–16 would be capable of providing fast electron transport, enlarged specific surface areas and superior light scattering ability compared to one-dimensional (1D) photoanode films, thus leading to improved photoelectric performance. Yamaguchi et al.17 developed a flexible DSSC using double layered TiOx NPs films/TiO2 NPs composite structures on stainless mesh as the photoanode and Ti/Pt as the counter electrode, and a 5.56% conversion efficiency was obtained. Lan et al.18 reported a three-dimensional interpenetrating network of TiO2 nanowire/nanoparticles nanostructures on Ti foil with a 6.43% photovoltaic efficiency. However, the fully flexible DSSCs still suffer a lot from photo-to-electric energy losses. Therefore, different approaches have been explored for the purpose of suppressing the photoelectron losses and improving the conversion efficiency, including core–shell structures,19 interface modification20 and metal ion doping.21–23 It is indicated that appropriate Nb-doping can efficiently shift the flat-band potential (Vfb) of TiO2 positively to accelerate electron injection efficiency and photocurrent.21 Li et al. presented a Nb-doped TiO2 nanorods arrays based DSSC with a 7.5% conversion efficiency22 and demonstrated that the enhanced performance was attributed to a reduced electron recombination rate, quicker electron injection and charge transport. Bein et al. also reported that appropriate Nb-doping can efficiently increase electrical conductivity of semiconductor nanoparticles.23
In our previous report, Nb2O5 coated hierarchical TiO2 nanowire-sheet arrays were prepared on a flexible Ti mesh substrate via a hydrothermal method, and the influences of TiO2 morphology and Nb2O5 coating amounts on the photoelectric properties of the flexible DSSCs were investigated in detail.24 However, the obtained FF (0.58) is still lower compared to the reported higher 0.73 value,25 leading to an undesirable 4.55% photovoltaic performance, which may be mostly ascribed to the larger electron transmission impedance and recombination losses between the generated photoelectrons and electrolyte (I3−) or oxidation states dye molecules. To date, no effort has been taken on the synthesis of TiO2 nanowire arrays/Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles on Ti mesh for fully flexible DSSCs (PEN/ITO-Pt as a counter electrode), and it is still a great challenge to enhance the photoelectric performance of the flexible DSSCs based on Ti mesh supported TiO2 composite structures.
In this study, in order to further suppress electron recombination, and improve electron transport ability and injection efficiency, metal Nb ions were doped into TiO2 nanoparticles to form Ti mesh supported TiO2 nanowires arrays/Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NWAs/Nb-doped TiO2 NPs) composite structures. The effects of different amounts of Nb-doping on the photovoltaic properties of TiO2 composite were studied. As a result, the completely flexible DSSCs assembled by TiO2 NWAs/2.4 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 NPs photoanode and PEN/ITO-Pt photocathode presented an improved 7.20% photovoltaic efficiency, which is much superior to the undoped TiO2 composite structures (4.96%).
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All the applied aqueous solutions in the experiment were prepared by utilizing deionized water. The mesh was purchased from the Metrology Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was made from commercially available 99.5 wt% pure titanium. Woven with 0.106 mm single wire, the applied 100-mesh cloth had a 60% open area. Before the experiment began, ethyl alcohol and acetone were used to clean the Ti-mesh by employing an ultrasound bath. Then, in order to decrease the residual stress, it was sintered at 500 °C for 1.5 h.
2.2 Synthesis of TiO2 NWAs/Nb-doped TiO2 NPs composite structures on Ti mesh
Nb-doped TiO2 composite films were prepared on Ti mesh substrates through a two-procedure hydrothermal reaction and spin-coating processes: (1) initially, Ti mesh underwent a 20 h hydrothermal processing in a 23 mL 1 mol L−1 NaOH precursor solution at 220 °C. Afterwards, the as-prepared initial resultants were cleaned with deionized water several times and soaked in 1 mol L−1 HCl solution for the ion exchange process. Then, after an annealing process at 500 °C for 2 h in a furnace, the TiO2 NWAs was achieved. (2) The precursor solution consisting of 10 mL tetrabutyl titanate and 20 mL ethanol was vigorously stirred for 30 min. Afterwards, the obtained solution was added dropwise to a mixed solution containing 50 mL acetic acid and 6 mL deionized water with magnetic stirring for 1.5 h at room temperature. After that, NbCl5 (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the TiO2 precursor solution at assigned doping levels (1.2 mol%, 2.4 mol%, 4.8 mol% and 9.6 mol%) and the mixture was magnetically stirred for 24 h. Then, it was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless–steel autoclave and underwent a hydrothermal reaction at 230 °C for 12 h, followed by gradually cooling the autoclave to normal temperature. Next, the products were washed with ethanol and deionized water repeatedly to rinse impurities and then dried in a constant temperature oven at 100 °C for 3 h.
Then, the as-prepared Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticle was mixed with ethanol, ethyl cellulose, terpineol, acetic acid and intensively stirred to obtain a uniform paste, which was deposited onto a TiO2 NWAs surface by a spin coating method with a spin coater (CAS, KW-4A) at rate of 1000 rpm for 20 s. Finally, Nb-doped TiO2 composite films were gradually heated through a process at 325 °C and 375 °C for 10 min, respectively, at 450 °C for 15 min, and lastly at 500 °C for 15 min.
2.3 Assembly of flexible DSSCs with the as-prepared Nb-doped TiO2 composite structure films on Ti meshes
The as-synthesized Nb-doped TiO2 composite structures were soaked in 0.3 mmol L−1cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis (2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium-(II) bis-tetrabutylammonium (N719 dye), and sensitized for about 10 h in a constant 40 °C atmosphere. Then, these photoanodes were cleaned with acetonitrile in order to rinse superfluous adsorbed N719 dye. The sensitized composite photoelectrodes were assembled together with a photocathode PEN/ITO-Pt (13 Ω cm−2). Glass//FTO-Pt (8 Ω cm−2) counter electrode was also used to compare the photovoltaic performance. The active area of the DSSC was 0.25 cm2 and the internal cavity between the two electrodes was injected with an electrolyte (0.1 mol L−1 LiI, 0.03 mol L−1 I2, 0.5 mol L−1tertbutylpyridine in acetonitrile/valeronitrile at 85:15 ratio and 0.6 mol L−1 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazoliumiodide by capillary action). The current–voltage characteristics were performed at a 0.1 V s−1 scan rate and the potential interval from 0 V to 1.0 V. The DSSC fill factor (FF) and photovoltaic efficiency (η) were characterized on the basis of the following formulae: (1) (2)where Jsc (mA cm−2), Voc (V), and FF are the short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor, respectively, and η (%) is the efficiency of photoelectric conversion ability. The Pin (100 mW cm−2) is an AM 1.5G simulated sunlight energy and Pmax (mW cm−2) is the maximum photoelectron output. The preparation steps of fully flexible DSSCs based on Nb-doped TiO2 composite structure are given in Fig. 1.

2.4 Characterization
A field emission scanning electronic microscope (FESEM) (a Zeiss supra 55) working at 10 kV was utilized to characterize the micro-morphologies of Nb-doped TiO2 composite structures. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) was conducted to measure the Nb doping quantity. A power X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku Dmax-2500) was used to analyze the crystal phase of the products. FTIR spectra were performed on a Shimadzu IRPrestige-21 to verify the Ti site substitution by Nb atoms. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Analytical Ltd) was carried out to study the valence state of Nb doped TiO2 NPs. The current–voltage characterization of the flexible DSSCs samples was finished on an electrochemical workstation with CHI-760C testing software as well as with simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2). The flat-band potential (Vfb) of Nb-doped TiO2 photoanode was analyzed by a three-electrode system. The adsorbed dye on the surface of Nb-doped TiO2 composite was desorbed using 0.1 mol L−1 NaOH solution, and then the obtained solution was employed to measure the absorbance through a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-3100). Moreover, the diffuse reflectance spectra of the composite photoanodes were also tested. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) in a frequency variation range of 0.01–105 Hz were characterized on an electrochemical workstation in the dark and under illumination. Afterwards, the impedance spectra were fitted by using Z-view software.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation and characterization of Ti mesh based on TiO2 NWAs/Nb-doped TiO2 NPs composite structures

Fig. 2 presents the XRD patterns of the as-prepared nanoparticles with different Nb contents on flexible Ti meshes. All characteristic diffraction peaks were favorably indexed as the anatase TiO2 structures in terms of the JCPDS card (No. 01-073-1764) and no other impure characteristic peaks were inspected, apart from some peaks located at the 38.439°, 40.227°, 52.880°, 70.178°, and 76.084° position for the metal Ti substrate in terms of the JCPDS standard card (No. 00-001-1197). This result indicated that the anatase TiO2 nanostructure was retained after Nb doping. Furthermore, with increasing Nb amount from 0 to 9.6 mol%, the diffraction peaks of the anatase TiO2 shifted to lower theta values due to the radius of doping Nb5+ (0.64 Å) being larger than that of the replaced Ti4+ (0.61 Å), suggesting anatase Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were obtained. The size of the as-prepared nanoparticles can be calculated according to the Debye–Scherrer equation D = Kγ/Bcosθ, where K is the Scherrer constant, 0.89; γ is the X-ray wavelength, 0.154056 nm; B is the width of the diffraction peak (101) half height, and D is the average diameter of the TiO2 nanoparticles in the vertical direction of the (101) crystal plane, in nm. With increasing Nb doping from 0 to 9.6 mol%, the average size of the formed nanoparticles first decreased from 13.4 nm to 9.8 nm, then increased from 9.8 nm to 11.3 nm (Table S1 in the ESI†), indicating that Nb doping may have had a slight influence on the average size of the TiO2 nanoparticles.

In order to confirm whether Nb ions were doped into the TiO2 crystal lattice, Fig. 3 gives the FTIR spectra of the Nb-doped TiO2 composite nanoparticles with different Nb amounts. Generally, the FTIR spectral peaks correspond to the different chemical bonds of the atoms. All the spectra exhibited small absorption peaks around 530.67 cm−1 and 479.03 cm−1, which should be related to the bending vibration of the TiO2 lattice.26,27 For different contents of Nb-doped TiO2 composite, as shown in Fig. 3 (right arrows), a new peak around 673.05 cm−1 could be clearly observed for the Nb-doped TiO2 films that was assigned to the Nb–O–Ti vibrations,28,29 and its intensity increased correspondingly with enhancing Nb doping amount. Furthermore, a peak appeared at about 1049.12 cm−1 on the main absorption spectra (left arrows), which was attributed to the Nb–O–Nb stretching vibrations,30 indicating that small amounts of Nb2O5 may co-exist with Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles due to hydrolysis reaction of the NbCl5 precursor.

In addition, XPS measurements were also carried out to further confirm whether Nb was doped into the TiO2 NPs (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). Quantitative testing for Nb-doping quantity was further carried out by FE-SEM-EDS spectroscopy (Fig. S2 and S3 in the ESI†), and the results (Table S2, ESI†) were presented to be in line with the theoretical values.
3.2 Photoelectric property of the fully flexible DSSC assembled by Ti mesh supported TiO2 NWAs/Nb-doped TiO2 NPs composite structures

Fig. 4 presents the FE-SEM images of TiO2 NWAs/Nb-doped TiO2 NPs composites on flexible Ti mesh substrates. It can be seen from Fig. 4(b–f) that a large number of Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with high density dispersed uniformly among the TiO2 nanowire arrays after the spin-coating process (also shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI†), which is beneficial for substantially increasing the surface area and light scattering ability of the formed composite structures, thus enhancing the light harvesting efficiency.

The current density–voltage curves of the flexible DSSCs using different Nb-doped TiO2 composites are presented in Fig. 5(a), a photograph of the assembled flexible DSSC with relatively good flexibility is given in Fig. 5(b), and the related photoelectric parameters are summarized in Table 1. It can be clearly seen that with Nb doping content increasing from 0 to 2.4 mol% and 9.6 mol%, the Jsc and Voc values first increased from 9.98 to 13.60 mA cm−2, and 0.74 to 0.78 V, then decreased to 8.83 mA cm−2 and 0.69 V, respectively, resulting in photoelectric conversion efficiencies from 4.96% to 7.20%, and then to 3.46%. By comparing the as-prepared composite structures, TiO2 NWAs/2.4 mol% Nb-doped NPs composite achieved an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 7.20%, a 45% improvement compared to a DSSC based on the undoped TiO2 composite structure.

3.3 Discussion on the enhanced photoelectric property of the fully flexible DSSC based on Ti mesh supported Nb-doped TiO2 composite structures
It is known that the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSC is basically decided by the short circuit current (Jsc), the open circuit voltage (Voc) as well as the fill factor (FF) according to eqn (2). Higher Jsc and larger Voc are needed for higher η. Generally, Jsc is determined by three crucial factors:31 the sunlight harvesting efficiency (ηlh), the photoelectron injection efficiency (ηinj) and the electron collection efficiency (ηec), as depicted in the following description (3), and the three factors depend strongly on the chemical composition and microstructure of the photoanode. Jsc ∝ ηlh × ηinj × ηec(3)

3.3.1 The sunlight harvesting efficiency (ηlh) of Nb-doped TiO2 composite structures. 

η
lh is directly related to the surface area of photoanode films, which can be reflected by the light scattering and dye adsorption abilities. Fig. 6(a) shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of as-synthesized products. It can be seen that the diffuse reflection ability of Nb-doped TiO2 composite in the 400–800 nm wavelength range reduced gradually with increasing Nb-doping content, suggesting that effective utilization for solar light was not improved due to Nb doping. Apparently, when the Nb doping amount was controlled at a relatively low level, such as 1.2 and 2.4 mol%, the light scattering was slightly decreased compared to the undoped TiO2 composite. With the Nb-doping amount increased from 4.8 and 9.6 mol%, a significant reduction in the light scattering was seen, which may be ascribed to aggregation phenomenon of the smaller Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles and hydrolysis reaction for the NbCl5 precursor.32,33
 Fig. 6  (a) Diffuse reflectance spectra of as-synthesized composites; (b) UV-Vis absorption spectra of desorbed dye solutions from the these sensitized Nb-doped TiO2 photoanodes on Ti mesh. 
In addition, the amount of adsorbed dye on the surface of the photoanode can also be used to detect the surface area. Fig. 6(b) illustrates the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the desorbed dye solutions from these sensitized Nb-doped TiO2 photoanodes on Ti meshes. As presented in Fig. 6(b), with the doping content increasing, the adsorbed dye amount was gradually reduced, which may be due to the formation of amorphous Nb2O5 between Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. When the Nb doping concentration was low (1.2, 2.4 mol%), the absorbance property at about 375 nm was reduced by less than 8%, demonstrating that the surface area of the Nb-doped TiO2 composite was slightly decreased. Further enhancing the Nb-doping content to 4.8 and 9.6 mol%, the amount of adsorbed dye was reduced quickly by more than 23%. The evidently decreased dye loading for 9.6 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 composite suggests a significantly reduced surface area for the Nb-doped TiO2 photoanode films. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the enhanced overall conversion efficiency should not be attributed to the morphology modification of the Nb-doped TiO2 composite structures.


3.3.2 The electron injection efficiency (ηinj) of Nb-doped TiO2 composite structures. 
The electron injection efficiency directly depends on the difference between the excited state energy of the dye and the flat band energy Efb (conduction band minimum) of the semiconductor TiO2, which is ascribed to the quasi-Fermi level (EFermi) of the semiconductor being equal to the flat-band potential (Vfb) when the semiconductor is in the flat-band state.21 The Vfb studies provided valuable information for understanding the electron injection. In order to find out the origin that resulted in the increased current density for the flexible DSSCs, the Vfb of Nb-doped TiO2 photoanodes were measured. Mott–Schottky study of the impedance-potential spectra34 is a common method to determine the Vfb. The measurement was carried out with a typical three-electrode system including Ti mesh supported Nb-doped TiO2 films (working electrode), a platinum wire (counter electrode), an Ag/AgCl standard electrode (reference electrode), and a 0.1 M NaCl supporting electrolyte. The Mott–Schottky plots and Vfb changes with Nb doping contents are shown in Fig. 7. Apparently, with increasing Nb doping amount, the Vfb exhibited a positive shift tendency from −0.771 to −0.665 V, thus the energy gap between flat band energy Efb of Nb-doped TiO2 and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of dye, namely, the driving force for photoelectron injection, increased. Consequently, electron injection became more easy and active, which accordingly resulted in photocurrent density improvement of the flexible DSSCs. Furthermore, a slight doping of Nb5+ ions might fill in surface state position of TiO2 lattice and efficiently reduce the amount of shallow energy defect that acted as an electron trap, so as to decrease the recombination rate for the electrons and holes,35,36 thereby improving the Voc to 0.78 V. However, considering Voc of the flexible DSSC, it is described as the difference value between the Fermi energy level (EFermi) of the TiO2 and the potential (En) of the I3−/I− couple (electrolyte).37 Therefore, a positive shift of the Vfb as well as EFermi would make the Voc of the DSSCs decrease to 0.69 V.
 Fig. 7  (a) Mott–Schottky plots of the undoped and Nb-doped TiO2 composite, and (b) shows the Vfb of the doped composites as a function of Nb doping amount. 
It is known that two key factors may influence the Vfb level of TiO2 nanoparticles; the first is the shape effect, and the other is the presence of defects.38 A smaller nanoparticle size may have contributed to the positive shift of Vfb, thus resulting in the increased ηinj.


3.3.3 The electron collection efficiency (ηec) of Nb-doped TiO2 composite structures. 
Generally, the electron collection efficiency of DSSC is mainly determined by three crucial factors: electron transport ability, electron transfer resistance (Rtr), and electron recombination resistance (Rrec), respectively.
As for the electron transport ability for Nb-doped TiO2 composite structures, the outer electron configuration of Ti and Nb atoms was 3d24s2 and 4d45s1. Therefore, after the Nb element was introduced, the charge balance compensation of Ti4+, which was replaced by Nb5+, was accomplished by generating one Ti cation vacancy for every four introduced Nb, as shown in eqn (4), or by the equimolar reduction reaction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ per Nb substituted (eqn (5)): (4) (5)
The occurrence of the two reactions directly depended on the systematic conditions.32 When the synthetic condition was highly oxidative, eqn (4) occurred easily because the Ti cations kept their higher oxidability. On the contrary, eqn (5) mainly corresponded to the low oxidative synthesis environments. Our Nb doping into TiO2 precursor solution was finished in a sealed autoclave with low oxidative conditions, and therefore reaction (5) was prone to occur, which has been also verified by Matsushima and Hirano.39 As a result, for every Nb5+ substitution, one additional electron was obtained by the Ti 3d orbital, which would increase the electron concentration.
Moreover, the improved charge transport ability could also be analyzed by the theoretical performance of the electric conductivity according to the equation σ = neμ. Where n, e and μ represent the electron concentration, elementary charge and charge mobility, respectively, and σ represents the electrical conductivity of the semiconductor. The μ value of Nb-doped TiO2 was increased to 5.6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared to undoped TiO2 (1.13 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).40 Consequently, the increased n and μ would help to improve the charge conductivity and electron-transfer speed, thereby leading to an improvement of ηec and Jsc. However, when excessive Nb (4.8, 9.6 mol%) was doped into TiO2, a high defect concentration was introduced, which would make the charge mobility decrease promptly due to the electron trapping by the crystal defects. Therefore, 2.4 mol% Nb-doping was an optimal amount, and the photocurrent density reduced inversely when Nb doping increased from 2.4 to 9.6 mol%.
As for the electron transfer resistance (Rtr) of Nb-doped TiO2 composite structures, the EIS was utilized to analyze the kinetics of electrochemical processes of the DSSCs. The Nyquist measurements of Nb-doped flexible DSSCs were carried out at a −0.78 V forward bias under 1 Sun illumination. In addition, the simulated equivalent circuit, applied to fit Nyquist plots, is presented in Fig. 8(c). Among them, Rs, RCE and Rtr/Rrec represent series resistance of two electrode substrates, electron transport resistance on the interface of the counter electrode/electrolyte and electron transport resistance of the TiO2/dye interface under illumination (or electron recombination resistance at the TiO2–electrolyte interface in the dark, Rrec), respectively.41 As shown in Fig. 8(a), the intersection in the high frequency region between the horizontal axis and Nyquist plot correspond to Rs, and the smaller and larger semicircles in Fig. 8(a) from left to right correspond to RCE and Rtr/Rrec, respectively. Fig. 8(b) gives the corresponding fitting plots of Nyquist (Fig. 8(a)) using the equivalent circuit, and the simulated resistances data are summarized in Table 2. The Rs showed a slight change due to the use of different Ti mesh substrates for every DSSC. As for assembling every new DSSC, the Pt counter electrode was changed, thus leading to the different RCE. Under 1.5G light, the flexible DSSC based on Nb-doped TiO2 photoanode (2.4 mol% Nb) showed the smallest Rtr (30.26 Ω), which demonstrated that photoelectrons could transfer faster in a 2.4 mol% Nb-doped photoelectrode of flexible DSSCs. The decreased Rtr was attributed to an increased electron concentration due to appropriate Nb doping. However, when 4.8 and 9.6 mol% Nb were doped into TiO2, the Rtr increased rapidly from 30.26 to 83.43 and 97.68 Ω. This may be mainly ascribed to the fact that the excessive Nb-doping might introduce more surface defects for anatase TiO2,21 which would inevitably increase the electron recombination and hinder the speedy electron transport.

As for the electron recombination resistance (Rrec) of Nb-doped TiO2 composite structures, Rrec is directly proportional to ηec and Voc, which is closely related to the two factors in accordance with the following equation:42,43 (6)where KB is the Boltzmann constant, 1.38 × 10−23 J K−1; q is the elementary charge, 1.602 × 10−19 C; Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent, mA cm−2; τe is the electron lifetime, ms; d is the thickness of photoanode film, μm; β = 1 m−1 as the reciprocal of ideality factor, which for the DSSCs is between 0.5 and 2.
Therefore, in order to better investigate the increment of the Voc quantitatively, EIS measurements of the DSSCs in the dark were performed at −0.78 V forward bias to achieve the Rrec (Ω) and interfacial electron lifetimes τe (ms) in the TiO2 conduction band. Fig. 9(a and b) presents Nyquist plots of the Nb-doped TiO2 composite based DSSCs in the dark and corresponding fitting plots. The fitting data results are listed in Table 3. In the dark, the Rrec denotes charge recombination resistance between the electrolyte (I3−) and injected electrons in the TiO2 conduction band. Clearly an enlarged width of the second semi-circle of the flexible DSSCs with a small amount of Nb doping (1.2, 2.4 mol%) and lower peak frequency value of phase manifested as a larger electron recombination resistance (Rrec) at the interface of the TiO2–electrolyte can be observed from Fig. 9(a–c). From Table 3, it is quite clear that the Rrec exhibited the order of 2.4 mol% Nb-doping (210.97 Ω) > 1.2 mol% Nb-doping (198.16 Ω) > pure TiO2 (173.93 Ω) > 4.8 mol% Nb-doping (128.38 Ω) > 9.6 mol% Nb-doping (116.30 Ω), confirming that injected electron back reaction with I3− in the electrolyte was better suppressed for those 2.4 mol% Nb-doped flexible DSSCs due to an additional effect of Nb doping, which may be explained by the schematic model in Fig. 10.

 Fig. 10  The schematic model indicating kinetics features at the photoanode Nb-doped TiO2/dye molecules/redox couple interface. 

Fig. 10 shows the schematic kinetics model of the photoanode Nb-doped TiO2/dye molecules/redox couple interface. First, photons were absorbed by the dye molecules, which then jumped from the ground state (D) to the excited state (D*); moreover, photoelectrons were injected into the TiO2 conduction band. There existed some surface traps at shallow energy levels of the TiO2 conduction band, and therefore, lots of injected electrons would decay into the surface traps state at a velocity of K1. For the decayed electrons, parts of them would be excited back to the TiO2 conduction band at a velocity of K2. However, parts of them would recombine with the redox electrolyte (I3−) at a rate of K3. The introduction of a small amount of Nb5+ may fill in the vacant positions of TiO2 surface crystal imperfections and reduce the energy trap state amounts,35,36 resulting in a decreased decayed rate K1 and recombination rate K3. Furthermore, the high ionization efficiency of Nb-doping could decrease the probabilities for the electron trapping.21 Consequently, small amounts of Nb dopants could facilitate the injected quicker electron transport and collection instead of recombination loss. From the Bode plot peaks, as presented in Fig. 9(c), the electron lifetime τe value could be obtained using the following eqn (7), where fp (Hz) is the frequency of the maximum phase in the middle frequency range (0.1 to 100 Hz).31 (7)
As shown in Fig. 9(d), the calculated τe reduced in the sequence of 2.4 mol% Nb doping (290.0 ms) > 1.2 mol% Nb-doping (250.1 ms) > pure TiO2 (239.8 ms) > 4.8 mol% Nb-doping (208.3 ms) > 9.6 mol% Nb-doping (196.6 ms), was in fine agreement with Voc together with Rrec values. This phenomenon proved that the Nb-doping played a significant role in the charge transport and collection because of the decreased recombination chances between the injected electrons (in the conduction band) and I3− (in the electrolyte) on the bare TiO2 surface.
Moreover, the charge collection efficiency can be evaluated from the quantitative formula ηec = (1 + Rtr/Rrec)−1. It can be seen from Table 3, that ηec of the flexible DSSC based on TiO2 NWAs/2.4 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 NPs photoanode reached 88%, which agreed well with its relatively high photoelectric conversion efficiency (7.20%).
In order to elucidate the effect of different counter electrodes on the cell performance, the DSSC based on TiO2 NWAs/2.4 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 NPs photoanode and Glass/FTO-Pt counter electrode was constructed, which exhibited a higher photovoltaic efficiency (7.52%) than that of the PEN/ITO-Pt based fully flexible DSSC (7.20%). This phenomenon may be ascribed to the smaller series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance of the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (RCE) (Fig. S5(a, b) and Tables S3, S4 in the ESI†).
In addition, a bending stress test seems to be a critical parameter for flexible DSSCs. It is indicated from Fig. S6, S7 and Table S5 (in the ESI†) that fully flexible DSSCs can retain about 97% of their original efficiency under a 100° bending stress angle.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we synthesized TiO2 NWAs/Nb-doped TiO2 NPs on a flexible Ti mesh substrate as a photoanode of DSSCs. The effect of different amounts of Nb-doping on the electronic band structure, transport resistance and recombination resistance of TiO2 composite were investigated. Appropriate Nb-doping into TiO2 nanostructures could efficiently improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of flexible DSSCs. Under AM 1.5G light, for a fully flexible DSSC based on TiO2 NWAs/2.4 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 NPs, the short-circuit current density reached 13.60 mA cm−2 and the open-circuit voltage reached 0.78 V, thereby achieving an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 7.20%, a 45% improvement compared to a DSSC with an undoped TiO2 composite structure. The accelerated electron injection efficiency, charge-transfer ability and inhibited electron–hole recombination, which were analyzed by UV-Vis absorption, Mott–Schottky, and EIS measurements under illumination and in the dark, were found to result in enhanced photoelectrical performance. The Bode plots analysis further verified the markedly influence of the Nb-doping quantitatively by the enhanced Rrec and electron lifetime τe, as well as Voc.
