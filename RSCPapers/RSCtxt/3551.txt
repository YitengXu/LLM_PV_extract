, Accepted 7th March 2013First published on 8th March 2013AbstractTwo broad bandgap polymers, poly{(indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene)-alt-[2,5-bis(thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-5,5′-diyl]} PIDTT-TzTz and poly{(indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene)-alt-[2,5-bis(6-octylthieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-5,5′-diyl]} PIDTT-TzTz-TT, were designed and synthesized by copolymerizing the ladder-type indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) donor with a thiazolothiazole (TzTz) acceptor. Both polymers possess moderate hole-mobilities of around ∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The polymer solar cells (PSCs) using PIDTT-TzTz–PC71BM as the active layer showed good power conversion efficiencies (PCEs as high as 5.53% and 5.90%) in both conventional and inverted devices, without using any solvent additives. These results demonstrate that these broad bandgap PIDTT-TzTz polymers have potential to be used as a front cell for polymer tandem cells.
Tremendous progress has been made in recent years on the development of organic photovoltaic materials, especially donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers, which have achieved an impressive photovoltaic performance of over 9% efficiency, when blended with fullerene derivatives.1,2 Among semiconducting polymers, broad bandgap (BBG) materials have attracted a lot of attention because of their potential applications in tandem solar cells3–5 and semi-transparent materials.6–9 To date, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the most representative BBG polymers. High photovoltaic performances of P3HT have been accomplished by utilizing indene–C60 (or C70) bis-adducts as the electron acceptor in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices.10–12 However, the long-term oxidative stability of P3HT is an issue due to its high-lying HOMO level, as well as film uniformity and reproducibility when it is used in large scale roll-to-roll printing because of P3HT's sensitivity to the processing conditions. To solve these issues, other alternative materials have been developed. The approach of using a D–A polymer is an attractive way to develop conjugated polymers due to easy tuning of their bandgaps and energy levels. From a molecular design viewpoint, weak donors are usually adopted in the polymer structure to ensure a low-lying HOMO level, which is closely correlated with the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of polymer photovoltaic devices.13 Many different kinds of donor structures have been utilized in BBG polymers, such as fluorene, carbazole, benzodithiophene (BDT), and indacenodithiophene (IDT).14–19 Meanwhile, the incorporated acceptor moieties have included 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT), 4,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiazole (BTz), or 2,5-bis(thiophen-2-yl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TzTz).20,21 High power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been obtained through subtle choices of donor and acceptor segments and tuning the side-chain structures.20,22 For example, PCDTBT, with a bandgap of 1.88 eV, prepared by copolymerizing 2,7-carbazole and DTBT, showed a high PCE above 6%.14,15 Janssen and co-workers further incorporated this BBG polymer into tandem solar cells, which resulted in a higher PCE of greater than 7% for their best devices.3 Nevertheless, compared to well-developed low bandgap polymers, BBG polymers remain less explored, especially while considering other aspects in addition to photovoltaic performance, such as long-term stability and ease of processing. It is highly desirable to design and synthesize new BBG materials to fulfil these requirements.
Ladder-type donors have been widely utilized in D–A polymers.23–29 These large fused-ring moieties usually result in polymers with high charge carrier mobilities due to reduced reorganizational energies and good solubility in common organic solvents. Amorphous materials are usually obtained based on ladder-type donors possessing cyclopentadiene rings because the out-of-plane side-chains prevent ordered packing of polymer backbones. Therefore, the morphologies of the as-prepared films of polymers or fullerene blends are not sensitive to processing conditions according to our previous studies,30,31 an important requirement for the commercialization of polymer solar cells. Moreover, impressive stability can be achieved based on ladder-type systems according to Cheng's work.32 The stable morphology of polymer films contributed greatly to the overall stability of the device.
Indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) is a relatively new ladder-type donor, which features improved mobility and absorption coefficients of its polymers when compared to IDT-based polymers.31 We believed that this donor would be an ideal segment for BBG polymers because it will not only enhance the mobility of the resulting polymers but also its weak donating strength should result in a deep-lying HOMO level, which is good for oxidative stability and critical to obtain a high Voc in photovoltaic devices.
In this communication, two copolymers based on the IDTT donor were synthesized and investigated, namely PIDTT-TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT (Scheme 1). TzTz was chosen as the acceptor moiety because of its rigid coplanar structure, which will not only facilitate π-electron delocalization but also enhance π–π stacking of the polymer backbone. TzTz-based polymers have also exhibited high mobilities in field-effect transistors (FET)33 and good photovoltaic performances.16,19 In these two polymers, thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) were used as π-bridges, which was expected to increase the effective conjugation length and enhance intermolecular charge hopping between polymers.34,35 However, PIDTT-TzTz-TT-based devices only showed a moderate PCE (4.4%), probably due to their poor solubility leading to un-optimized phase separation with PC71BM. Encouragingly, PIDTT-TzTz derived devices showed high PCEs of 5.53% and 5.90%, respectively in regular and inverted solar cell architectures, which makes it one of the best performing BBG polymers for PSCs.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures and synthetic routes of PIDTT-TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT. 
PIDTT-TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT were synthesized via the Stille cross-coupling polymerization reaction with palladium catalyst, the details of which can be found in the ESI.† PIDTT-TzTz has moderate solubility in hot chlorobenzene (CB) and dichlorobenzene (DCB) while PIDTT-TzTz-TT is only soluble in hot DCB. The number-average molecular weights of PIDTT-TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT were 26 kDa and 34 kDa, respectively, with polydispersity indices (PDI) of 4.18 and 3.91. Differential scanning calorimetry of the polymers showed no apparent thermal transitions for either of the polymers between 20 °C and 280 °C.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the two polymers in DCB solutions and in films are shown in Fig. 1. For PIDTT-TzTz, an absorption peak at 569 nm was observed in the DCB solution while its maximum peak in the film was blue-shifted to 531 nm, probably due to twisting of the polymer backbone when the polymer chains were forced to pack together. Notably, PIDTT-TzTz-TT showed the same absorption maxima in both solution and film states, which can be ascribed to the increased rigidity and coplanarity of its backbone compared to PIDTT-TzTz.36 Both polymers possess a broad optical bandgap (Eg) of 2.0 eV according to the onsets of film spectra at around 620 nm.

The energy levels of both polymers were estimated by cyclic voltammetry measurements. The corresponding redox curves are shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PIDTT-TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT are (−5.24, −3.21) and (−5.34, −3.03) eV, respectively. Owing to the incorporated IDTT donor moiety, both polymers possess reasonably low-lying HOMO levels, which is promising for achieving high Voc in their photovoltaic devices.31 The even lower-lying HOMO level of PIDTT-TzTz-TT compared to that of PIDTT-TzTz is probably due to the higher aromaticity of the TT π-bridge unit relative to the thiophene unit.37,38 The high-lying LUMO levels of both polymers guarantee sufficient energy offsets to drive charge separation at the interface between the polymer and PC71BM in photovoltaic devices.
Charge mobilities of pristine polymers in FET devices were investigated with a bottom gate/top contact configuration. The corresponding transfer curves are shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI† and relevant parameters are summarized in Table 1. PIDTT-TzTz-TT showed a saturated hole mobility of 7.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, slightly higher than that of PIDTT-TzTz (1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). This result suggests that the extended TT bridge in PIDTT-TzTz-TT indeed improves hole transportation, due to the increased coplanarity of the polymer backbone and enhanced intermolecular charge hopping compared to PIDTT-TzTz.34

Photovoltaic properties of both polymers were investigated initially with a BHJ device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/bis-C60/Ag under the illumination of AM 1.5G at 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. S3 of the ESI†).39–42 Typical J–V curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 2a and the performance of these devices is summarized in Table 2. The PIDTT-TzTz device showed an impressive PCE of 5.53% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 10.41 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.59 without the use of any processing additives or post-treatment, while the device made from PIDTT-TzTz-TT gave a similar Voc of 0.89 V, an inferior Jsc of 9.51 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.52, resulting in a lower PCE of 4.4%. Although PIDTT-TzTz-TT has a higher hole mobility than PIDTT-TzTz, the lower Jsc and FF of PIDTT-TzTz-TT-based devices can be attributed to their inferior solubility, which reduces the polymer composition in the BHJ layer and leads to an un-optimized morphology. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were acquired to investigate the difference of morphologies of BHJ layers (Fig. S4†). A relatively smoother thin film morphology was observed for the PIDTT-TzTz-based BHJ layer, coinciding with the better phase separation in this active layer, resulting in higher performance of devices.

Since inverted polymer solar cells have the advantages of high air stability, preferred vertical composition gradient and compatibility with roll-to-roll printing techniques, they have been widely explored using various materials, including BBG polymers.43–45 Therefore, PIDTT-TzTz was further explored using an inverted architecture (Fig. S5 of the ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 2, the inverted configuration led to a superior device performance compared to the conventional device architecture, possessing a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 10.99 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.59, giving a PCE of 5.90%.
The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of polymer–PC71BM devices with both regular and inverted architectures were measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. All the Jsc values calculated from the EQE curves under the standard AM 1.5G conditions match well with those obtained from the J–V measurements. Notably, the PIDTT-TzTz device has a high EQE of 70% around 550 nm, which ensures the efficient light-absorbing ability of this BBG polymer.
In conclusion, two BBG polymers PIDTT-TzTz and PIDTT-TzTz-TT have been designed and synthesized based on the ladder-type donor, IDTT. Both polymers possess moderate hole-mobilities of around ∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. High photovoltaic performance with PCEs of 5.53% and 5.90% could be obtained for PIDTT-TzTz in conventional and inverted device architectures, respectively, without the use of any solvent additives. These are among the highest performances reported for BBG polymers. When these promising results are combined with a large bandgap (Eg = 2.0 eV), easy processing, and a low-lying HOMO level, it makes PIDTT-TzTz an ideal material for incorporating into the front part of the tandem solar cells or semi-transparent solar cells for energy producing windows.
