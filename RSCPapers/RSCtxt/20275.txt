    , Accepted 7th April 2017First published on 7th April 2017AbstractA series of metal–organic frameworks isoreticular to MIL-125-NH2 were prepared, where the 2-amino-terephthalate organic links feature N-alkyl groups of increasing chain length (from methyl to heptyl) and varying connectivity (primary and secondary). The prepared materials display reduced optical bandgaps correlated with the inductive donor ability of the alkyl substituent as well as high photocatalytic activity towards the reduction of carbon dioxide under blue illumination operating over 120 h. Secondary N-alkyl substitution (isopropyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl) exhibits larger apparent quantum yields than the primary N-alkyl analogs directly related to their longer lived excited-state lifetime. In particular, MIL-125-NHCyp (Cyp = cyclopentyl) exhibits a small bandgap (Eg = 2.30 eV), a long-lived excited-state (τ = 68.8 ns) and a larger apparent quantum yield (Φapp = 1.80%) compared to the parent MIL-125-NH2 (Eg = 2.56 eV, Φapp = 0.31%, τ = 12.8 ns), making it a promising candidate for the next generation of photocatalysts for solar fuel production based on earth-abundant elements.
Introduction
The accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as a result of human activity is one of the largest contributing factors in the gradual warming of the Earth.1 Our planet has a natural system of negative feedback processes to balance these accumulations, primarily by carbon fixation through photosynthesis. The amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere is far too large for natural photosynthesis to reduce its accumulation in the short term. Therefore, it is urgent that technologies be developed that are capable of fixing large quantities of CO2 into organic matter, which are both energetically efficient and capable of creating a usable feedstock of reduced carbon (so-called solar fuel).2 These new technologies require the use of a naturally abundant and sustainable source of energy. Early transition metal oxides, in particular titanium oxides, are capable of reducing CO2 when excited by UV light.3 Using sunlight to reduce CO2 directly would be ideal; however, the majority of the sun's rays are in the visible-IR range,4 which is too low energy to induce photoreduction with these materials, limiting their applicability on environmentally relevant scales. Thus, materials that are able to reduce CO2 with the use of visible light are an imminent and currently unfulfilled need.
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)5 are a class of porous materials composed of metal-oxide clusters connected through organic links forming highly crystalline open structures that offer a promising alternative to metal-oxide semiconductors for photocatalysis. Research in the design and synthesis of new MOFs (reticular chemistry6) has allowed for the creation of functional materials with unprecedented high porosity (surface areas up to 10000 m2 g−1)7 and exceptional chemical and thermal stability, with applications in gas storage,8 gas separation,9 heterogeneous catalysis,10 payload release,11 and sensing,12 among others. MOFs are materials with extraordinary chemical and functional versatility, because both the organic and inorganic components can be systematically varied towards targeted applications in a systematic manner.13
Titanium based MOFs, in particular, combine the photocatalytic activity of titanium oxide clusters with the light absorption properties of organic linkers, producing materials that can be photocatalytically active under UV-visible light.14 These catalytic reactions are facilitated through either oxidative,14a,15 or reductive16 photoinduced electron transfer within the Ti-MOF under irradiation. MIL-125-NH2 (MIL = Materials Institut Lavoisier) is a titanium-based MOF constructed from 2-aminoterephthalate and a Ti8O12 ring-shaped cluster (Fig. 1) that has shown activity towards photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide.17 The biggest challenge in increasing and optimizing this activity for operating in the visible range relies on tuning the bandgap (or HOMO–LUMO gap) of this material (Eg = 2.56 eV). de Miguel et al. established that photoirradiation of MIL-125-NH2 with UV-visible light produces a long-lived charge-separated state whose lifetime is directly related to photocatalytic activity.18 Moreover, it has been demonstrated through high-level DFT calculations that this charge-separated excited state is accessible due to the difference in the electronic distribution of the frontier bands/orbitals.19 Hendon et al. propose that in this MOF, the top of the valence band—or HOMO—is localized in the aromatic ring of the 2-aminoterephthalate, and the bottom of the conduction band—or LUMO—is localized in the d-states of the titanium ions favoring charge separation upon photoexcitation.19a They also propose that a strategy to decrease the bandgap of this MOF (and thus absorbing more visible light) is by destabilizing the valence band by increasing the electron density in the π-cloud of the terephthalate. It has been previously demonstrated that incorporating 2,5-diaminoterephthalate and 2-aminoterephthalate into the MIL-125 framework effectively decreases the optical bandgap. Other efforts include post-synthetic modification of MIL-125-NH2via diazotization of the amine followed by addition of an electron-rich aniline forming diazo-based groups on the surface of the MOF particles, which exhibit enhanced photooxidation of benzyl alcohols.15b
 Fig. 1  Top: Crystal structure of the parent MOF MIL-125 utilized in this study. Bottom: Molecular structure of the organic link in MIL-125-NH2 and the N-substituted isoreticular MOFs prepared in this work. Gray spheres = carbon, white = hydrogen, red = oxygen, blue polyhedral = titanium, and the yellow sphere represents the size of the pore in the MOF. 
Here we report the synthesis of a family of titanium MOFs isoreticular to MIL-125-NH2, where the amine functionality is decorated with alkyl chains of varying length and connectivity, i.e., methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and n-heptyl (Fig. 1). Our rationale for this functionalization strategy relies on the hypothesis that sequential addition of carbon atoms to the N-alkyl amino group will result in increased electron density in the terephthalate ring as a consequence of subtle inductive effects. These are well-known electronic effects that result from the polarization of a chemical species through σ-bonds due to differences in electronegativity between a heteroatom (in this case nitrogen) and the carbon atoms in the alkyl chains. Moreover, these effects should be more evident in the secondary and tertiary alkyls.20 Thus, increasing the number of σ-bonds in the chain should result in larger electron density around the nitrogen atom in 2-aminoterephthalate, causing an increased density in the aromatic ring, and therefore destabilizing the top of the valence band. By successively destabilizing the valence band in small steps, the bandgap of the MOFs should decrease, and higher photocatalytic activity can be achieved under visible light irradiation. We studied the effect of the N-alkyl substitution on the CO2 adsorption, as well as the photophysical and photocatalytic properties of the materials, particularly the absorption onset, and excited state lifetimes. These parameters were also studied to understand the photocatalytic activity towards reduction of CO2 utilizing visible light only, in the form of blue LEDs.
Experimental
All starting materials and solvents, unless otherwise specified, were obtained from commercial sources (Aldrich, Fisher, VWR) and used without further purification. All reactions were performed under ambient laboratory conditions, and no precautions were taken to exclude oxygen or atmospheric moisture unless otherwise specified. Anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were purified using a custom-built alumina-column based solvent purification system (Innovative Technology). Anhydrous methanol was obtained from Aldrich (Sureseal). Mesitylene and hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) were dried over activated 4 Å molecular sieves. Deuterated solvents (CDCl3, DMSO, D2O, CD3CN, and NaOD 40% in D2O) were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Lab.
Instrumentation
High-resolution 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were collected using a Bruker AVANCE-III 400 MHz spectrometer. The chemical shifts are reported relative to the solvent residual signal. NMR data analysis was performed using MestReNova package (v. 10.0.2). Liquid chromatography-mass spectra (LC-MS) were recorded using an Agilent 6230 TOF coupled with an Agilent Zorbax SB-C18 analytical column. Fourier-transform infrared spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum ONE Universal FT-IR ATR. 32 scans were collected for each sample at a resolution of 120000 cm−1 from 4000–650 cm−1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was conducted using a JEOL JSM 6480 microscope under low-vacuum with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Sample preparation involved the dispersion of samples upon carbon tape attached to a stainless steel sample holder.
Powder X-ray diffraction
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected using a Rigaku MiniFlex 600 θ–2θ diffractometer in Bragg–Brentano geometry with a 300 mm goniometer diameter, Ni-filtered CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 600 W power (40 kV, 15 mA), equipped with a NaI(Tl) SC-70 scintillation detector, 5.0° incident and receiving Soller slits, a 0.625° divergent slit, a 1.25° scattering slit, and a 0.3 mm receiving slit and a Ni-CuKβ filter. Samples were analyzed from 3 to 40 2θ-degrees with 0.02° per step and a scan rate of 0.25 2θ-degrees min−1. The samples were prepared by dropping the powder sample into a glass sample holder and pressing the powder with a razor blade spatula forming a smooth surface. Crystal models were created using Materials Studio modeling suite21 starting from the published crystal of MIL-125 (CCDC code RUPRUQ)14a by adding the corresponding N-alkyl chains. Rietveld refinements were performed with the modeled crystals and the experimental patterns using GSAS-II (see ESI† for more details).22
Gas adsorption isotherm analysis
Gas adsorption isotherm analysis was performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area and porosimetry analyzer. Measurements were performed at 77 K (liquid N2 bath) for N2 (g), and at 273, 283 and 298 K (water circulator bath) for CO2 (g) on thermally activated samples. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were obtained by performing a Rouquerol analysis over the linear isotherm to determine the upper limits of the BET model from the N2 isotherms. A linear least squares fitting over the BET plot provided the parameter for the volume of the monolayer, BET surface area and C-constant were obtained following the recommendation by Snurr et al. for determination of the surface area in MOFs.23 Differential enthalpies of CO2 adsorption were obtained by fitting the isotherms at the three measured temperatures into a virial equation using the Micromeritics data processing software.
Solid-state absorption spectra
Solid-state absorption spectra were collected at room temperature using an Edinburgh FLS980 spectrometer with an integrating sphere accessory. The light output from a housed 450 W Xe lamp was passed through a single grating (1800 λ mm−1, 250 nm blaze) Czerny–Turner monochromator and then into the integrating sphere containing the powder MIL-125-NHR sample or scattering reference (BaSO4). The output from the integrating sphere was passed through a single grating (1800 λ mm−1, 500 nm blaze) Czerny–Turner monochromator and finally detected by a Peltier-cooled Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube. Synchronous spectral scans were performed with both excitation and emission monochromators, with a zero wavelength offset, stepping through the pre-set spectral range. Absorbance was then calculated using Edinburgh's F900 software package. Tauc plots were obtained assuming α(hν) = (Ahν)2.
Transient absorption (TA) measurements
The samples for TA were prepared by suspending MIL-125-NHR in ∼3.0 mL of MeCN in a 1 cm × 1 cm quartz cuvette (A ≈ 0.2 O.D.). Measurements were performed on a spectrometer composed of a Continuum Surelite EX Nd:YAG laser combined with a Continuum Horizon OPO (λex = 405 nm, 5–7 ns, operated at 1 Hz, beam diameter ∼0.5 cm, 5 mJ per pulse) integrated into a commercially available Edinburgh LP980 laser flash photolysis spectrometer. White light probe pulses generated by a pulsed 150 W Xe lamp were passed through the sample, focused into the monochromator, and then, for full spectrum data, were detected using an intensified Andor iStar CCD camera. Single wavelength kinetic absorption at 500 nm was detected by a photomultiplier tube with a 435 nm long pass filter placed before the detector to reject unwanted scattered light. Detector outputs were processed using a Tektronix TDS3012C Digital Phosphor Oscilloscope interfaced to a PC. Single wavelength kinetic data were the result of averaging 50 laser shots. Detector outputs were processed using the Edinburgh's L900 (version 8.2.3, build 0) software package. Time-resolved absorption data were fit with the exponential function in eqn (1) where τ is the lifetime. I = Ioe−t/τ(1)

Synthesis of N-alkyl-2-amino-terephthalate dimethyl ester (1a–d, 1g). 
2-Amino-terephthalate dimethyl ester (2.00 g, 9.56 mmol) was suspended in anhydrous DMF (20 mL) and stirred until fully dissolved (HMPA was used instead of DMF for 1g). K2CO3 (5.30 g, 38.2 mmol) was added, followed by dropwise addition of alkyl iodide (14.3 mmol), and the mixture was stirred for 18 h at 100 °C. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature and quenched with 2 M HCl (aq.) to pH = 3. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3 × 50 mL), and the combined organic extracts were washed with brine (3 × 50 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered through celite and the solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. The obtained crude was purified using flash chromatography (SiO2, 15% v/v EtOAc:hexanes, dry loading).


Synthesis of N-cycloalkyl-2-amino-terephthalate dimethyl ester (1e, 1f). 
Under N2 (g) in a 25 mL two-neck round bottom flask with a magnetic stir bar, 2-aminoterephthalate dimethyl ester (1.00 g, 4.78 mmol) was suspended in anhydrous DMF (3.2 mL) and stirred until fully dissolved. TMSCl (1.30 g, 11.95 mmol) and the corresponding cyclic ketone (5.25 mmol) were added to the solution and the mixture was cooled to 0 °C in an ice bath. NaBH4 (0.18 g, 4.78 mmol) was added cautiously over 5 min. The mixture was then allowed to warm up to room temperature and monitored by TLC until the disappearance of the starting material. The mixture was quenched with saturated NaHCO3 (aq.) followed by extraction with EtOAc (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic fractions were then washed with brine (3 × 10 mL) and dried over MgSO4, filtered through celite and the solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. The obtained crude was purified using flash chromatography (SiO2, 5–10% v/v EtOAc:hexanes, dry loading).


Synthesis of N-alkyl-2-amino-terephthalic acid (2a–f). 
The alkylated diester 1a–f (0.50 g) was dissolved in THF (25 mL), followed by addition of 1 M NaOH (aq., 12.8 mL). The solution was heated to 70 °C and stirred for 8 h. The mixture was concentrated in a rotary evaporator at 45 °C to remove the excess THF. The mixture was cooled to room temperature followed by addition of 1 M HCl (aq.) until pH = 3. The observed precipitate was isolated by filtration, rinsed with water, and dried in air at room temperature for 6 h.


Synthesis of MIL-125-NHR. 
Compounds 2a–f (0.41 mmol) were placed in 20 mL scintillation vials with anhydrous DMF (4.90 mL) and anhydrous MeOH (0.35 mL). The mixture was mixed thoroughly by immersing the vial in an ultra-sonic bath for 1 min and then transferred into a borosilicate glass tube (see ESI† for more details) and bubbled with N2 (g) for 5 min. Ti(OiPr)4 (0.031 mL, 0.106 mmol) was added to the tube via syringe, immediately flash frozen in liquid N2, and flame sealed as described in the ESI.† The sealed tube was heated to 150 °C for 48 h. After cooling to room temperature, the formed powder was isolated by filtration and rinsed with DMF (3×) and CHCl3 (3×). The powder was immersed in CHCl3 and stored for 3 d in a desiccator, replacing the solvent during this time (8×). The solvent was removed by decantation and the solvent-wet powder was dried under dynamic vacuum (10 mtorr) for 48 h at room temperature. The degassed yellow solid was stored under N2 in a desiccator.

Blue LED photochemical reactor setup and calibration
Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a home-built reactor using a 60 W blue LED strip (5 m long, MEILI, product # CNMX-Hardlines-464321) with λ = 466 nm (fwhm = 20 nm), the strip was coiled and glued inside a 20 cm diameter tin can and mounted on top of a magnetic stirrer. The temperature inside the photoreactor was kept at 25 °C with the aid of an attached fan and a thermometer. The photon flux of the photoreactor was determined using iron oxalate actinometry at 466 nm following the protocol by Parker et al.24 obtaining a volumetric photon flux of Ro,λ = 1.92 × 10−3 mol (photons) L−1 h−1. The apparent quantum yield, Φapp (also named photonic efficiency), was determined according to the IUPAC recommended protocol by Serpone et al.25 using the formula: (2)where Rin corresponds to the initial rate of the reaction (see below) and Ro,λ is the volumetric photon flux.
Photochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formate
Photochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formate was performed under ambient conditions in the photoreactor described above. MIL-125-NHR (3–5 mg) was loaded into a 3 mL borosilicate vial with a magnetic stirrer. 1.5 mL of a CO2-bubbled stock solution containing triethanolamine (TEOA, 0.30 mol L−1) and mesitylene (1.5 mmol L−1) in MeCN-d3 was added to the vial and tightly capped with a PTFE/rubber septum. A flow of CO2 (g) was bubbled into the vial with the aid of a needle with an input positive pressure of 1 psi for 30 min previous to photoirradiation. During irradiation, 40 μL aliquots were sampled every 12 h with the aid of a syringe, the aliquot was filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE syringe membrane into an NMR tube. The filtrate was diluted with CDCl3 (∼0.6 mL) and a total of 256 transients were measured for each time point. Kinetic plots were obtained in both concentration and turnover number in the ordinate axis. The concentration was obtained by addition of the intensity of the photoreduced-CO2 signals (formate + HEF + BHEF) and normalizing with respect to the internal standard, and the turnover number was determined as the total number of moles of photoreduced-CO2 (mol CO2 + mol HEF + mol BHEF) per mol of the photocatalyst (with respect to the organic linker). The initial rate of the reaction was obtained by fitting a third order polynomial function using a linear least squares fitting and then evaluating its first derivative at t = 0.
Results and discussion
The isoreticular family of MOFs was prepared via a SN2 reaction of 2-amino terephthalate dimethyl ester (Scheme 1) with the corresponding alkyl iodide under basic conditions forming intermediates 1a–d and 1g in moderate yields. Intermediates 1e–f were synthesized via reductive amination with cyclopentanone or cyclohexanone in the presence of NaBH4/TMSCl in cold DMF in high yields. Hydrolysis of the dimethyl esters in NaOH/THF afforded linkers 2a–g, and solvothermal MOF crystallization with Ti(OiPr)4 in DMF/MeOH in flame sealed borosilicate tubes produced the desired MOFs in high yields (see ESI†). The molecular integrity of the linkers within the MOFs was determined using 1H NMR by dissolving the synthesized MOFs in 0.1 M NaOD in D2O (Fig. S1†). These measurements allowed identifying any loss of alkyl chains at the N-substitution, as it has been observed by others26 that solvothermal conditions using tetravalent early transition metal ions (such as Zr+4) in DMF can induce dealkylations at the N-substitution. No loss of N-alkyl chains was observed in any of the prepared MOFs, indicating a robust and clean crystallization. Attempts to prepare a double methylated aminoterephthalate MIL-125-NMe2 using linker 3 were unsuccessful (Scheme 2) due to the decomposition of the linker into the monomethylated species 2a, with 80% conversion while forming non-porous amorphous solids. We deduced that the steric constrain imposed by the double substitution impedes the crystallization of the MOF, while Ti+4 induces N-dealkylation, similar to Zr-based MOFs, and thus only single N-alkylated MOFs were successfully synthesized.

 Scheme 2  Attempted synthesis of MIL-125-NMe2. Note: attempts to prepare this MOF under the same conditions as in mono N-substituted MOFs resulted in N-demethylation of the linker with formation of amorphous non-porous samples. 
The MOFs were obtained as microcrystalline powders that were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) crystallography. SEM images (Fig. S10–S17†) displayed samples with uniform particle shape and texture, suggesting homogeneous materials. All the materials display sharp diffraction peaks (Fig. 2) starting at 6.8° 2θ, evidencing a high degree of crystallinity with large unit cells, as expected in a MOF. All patterns were indexed by comparison to the simulated pattern of MIL-125-NH2,17 suggesting the formation of frameworks that are isoreticular to MIL-125. Crystal simulation using Materials Studio Modeling Suite21 produced the library of suitable models for crystal structure solution with the Rietveld method. Refinements of the experimental patterns vs. the theoretical crystals allowed the solution of the crystal structures in the high-symmetry tetragonal I4/mmm space group with low residuals (see ESI†), where the –NR groups were assumed to be disordered around the four possible positions in the terephthalate ring and inside the pore.
 Fig. 2  Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the isoreticular family of MIL-125-NHR compared to the simulated pattern of the parent MIL-125-NH2 (Rietveld refinement parameters in the ESI†). 
The porosity of the MOFs was determined using N2 gas adsorption at 77 K. All isotherms display IUPAC Type II isotherm behavior that corresponds to microporous materials with fully reversible adsorption behavior (Fig. S18–S47†). Application of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model in the low-pressure region of the isotherm resulted in BET surface areas between 200 and 1000 m2 g−1. A progressive decrease is observed in the order of MIL-125-NH2 (SBET = 1200 m2 g−1) > MIL-125-NHMe (SBET = 1000 m2 g−1) > MIL-125-NHEt (SBET = 750 m2 g−1) > MIL-125-NHBu (SBET = 690 m2 g−1) > MIL-125-NHCyp (SBET = 580 m2 g−1) > MIL-125-NHiPr (SBET = 490 m2 g−1) > MIL-125-NHCy (SBET = 420 m2 g−1) > MIL-125-NHhep (SBET = 230 m2 g−1). The total cumulative pore volume, obtained from non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) fitting of the N2 isotherms, resulted in decreasing pore volumes consistent with increased substitution (Fig. S48†) decreasing from 0.73 cm3 (STP) g−1 in MIL-125-NH2 to 0.09 cm3 (STP) g−1 in MIL-125-NHhep. The CO2 adsorption isotherms at 273 (Fig. 3a), 283 and 298 K (Fig. S49–S56†) exhibit a similar trend in uptake where increased N-alkyl substitution results in lower uptakes from 221 cm3 g−1 in MIL-125-NH2, to 19.1 cm3 g−1 in MIL-125-NHhep. These trends are consistent with: (1) the increased amount of weight of the MOF by addition of extra atoms in the N-alkyl chain, and (2) the decreased accessibility to the pores as a result of clogging of the pore and pore apertures as the alkyl chains occupy the free space of the pores. We also observed that although the functionalized MOFs display lower CO2 uptakes than the parent MIL-125-NH2 at room temperature (especially MIL-125-NHCyp, MIL-125-NHCy, and MIL-125-NHhep), their adsorption capacity has little effect on their CO2 photoreduction rates (see below), which only suggests that mass transport within the pores is not the rate determining step in the photoreduction. Determination of the differential enthalpy of adsorption Δḣads (Fig. 3b) allows understanding of the thermodynamic interactions between CO2 and the MOFs. We observed no particular trend given by the systematic N-alkyl substitution across the uptake ranges, with all MOFs observing similar Δḣads to MIL-125-NH2, ranging from −20 kJ mol−1 (MIL-125-NHEt) to −27 kJ mol−1 (MIL-125-NHMe) when loading 1 CO2 molecule per unit cell. This lack of trend in adsorption enthalpy evidences the convoluted effect of: (1) the inherent porosity of the parent MIL-125 framework, (2) the electron rich nature of the amino nitrogen lone pair acting as a Lewis basic site, and (3) the steric hindrance imposed by the bulky alkyl substituents. While the enthalpy of adsorption is a combination of all these effects, the undiluted electronic effects are better understood by the determination of the bandgap of the MOFs.

CO2 adsorption points at high pressure in MIL-125-NH2 have been measured elsewhere17 and are not shown for clarity.

The UV-visible absorption spectra for crystalline powder of the MIL-125-NHR series were acquired using an integrating sphere and the results can be seen in Fig. 4a. The parent MIL-125-NH2 exhibits a low energy absorption peak at 375 nm. As expected, a gradual red shift in the absorption is observed for the alkylated derivatives; presumably the shift can be attributed to the alkyl donor group destabilizing the top of the valence band (HOMO) of the amino terephthalate linker. Application of the Tauc model to the photoabsorption plots (Fig. S57–S64†) allowed for the determination of the optical bandgap (or HOMO–LUMO gap). A decrease in the bandgap of the materials is observed (Fig. 4b) from MIL-125-NH2 (Eg = 2.56 eV) to MIL-125-NHCy (Eg = 2.29 eV) in a stepwise mode with increased alkyl chain substitution, as expected from the inductive effects of the corresponding alkyl chain. Of the series, the n-heptyl substituted MOF displayed a larger bandgap than the cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl, and is close in value to the n-butyl substituted MOF. This behavior is due to the linear nature of the heptyl chain. Inductive effects decrease exponentially as the C–C σ-bonds are further away from the heteroatom, expecting very little induction beyond the fourth σ-bond, as observed in MIL-125-NHBu and MIL-125-NHhep. In contrast, cyclic substituents retain the σ-bonds in close proximity to the amine group, resulting in stronger electronic induction and therefore lower bandgaps. We expect that tertiary carbon substitutions (e.g., tert-butyl), or N,N-dialkyls (e.g. MIL-125-NMe2) would result in even lower bandgaps.
The photocatalytic rates and efficiencies of MIL-125-NHR MOFs are known to be dependent on the lifetime of the photogenerated charge-separated state.18 To gain insights into the excited state dynamics, nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was performed on suspensions of selected MIL-125-NHR in MeCN and the results can be seen in Fig. 4c and Fig. S66–S69.† Upon excitation at 405 nm the parent material, MIL-125-NH2, exhibits a bleach from 390 nm to 530 nm and positive ΔA features at λ < 390 nm and λ > 530 nm (Fig. S65†). These transient spectroscopic features are indicative of the charge-separated state with a hole on the aminoterephthalate linker and the electron on the titanium-oxo cluster.18,27 Similarly, absorption features are observed for the alkylated derivatives with example spectra of MIL-125-NHMe shown in Fig. 4c and all other spectra in the ESI.† As was observed with the ground state absorption, the alkylated complexes' ΔA features are red shifted by ∼30 nm compared to MIL-125-NH2. The lifetime of the charge-separated state for the measured set of MIL-125-NHR materials was monitored at 500 nm (λex = 405 nm) and the results can be seen in Fig. 4d. The lack of the signal rise time indicates that the charge-separated state is generated within the instrument response time (<10 ns). The charge-separated lifetime increases in the order of MIL-125-NH2 (τ = 12.8 ns) < MIL-125-NHMe (τ = 38.2 ns) < MIL-125-NHBu (τ = 52.1 ns) < MIL-125-NHEt (τ = 60.63 ns) < MIL-125-NHCyp (τ = 68.9 ns) < MIL-125-NHCyp (τ = 68.8 ns) < MIL-125-NHhep (τ = 69.2 ns) < MIL-125-NHiPr (τ = 75.11 ns) < MIL-125-NHCy (τ = 91.35 ns) generally corresponding to a trend of longer lifetimes with greater donor ability of the alkyl substituent. Presumably, the enhanced stabilization of the oxidized terephthalate by the secondary alkyl chain is responsible for the long lifetime observed for MIL-125-NHiPr, MIL-125-NHCyp and MIL-125-NHCy.
We explored the photocatalytic activity of the isoreticular MOFs towards CO2 photoreduction using blue irradiation (Scheme 3). A LED light source was utilized because of its accessibility, low cost, high irradiance, low power needs and narrow emission profile, compared to Xe-based lamps.28 Moreover, using a narrow band aids in circumventing photocatalysis by any residual titanium oxide formed during the MOF synthesis, as these phases require light in the UV region (λ < 350 nm).3 Irradiating MIL-125-NHR suspensions in MeCN-d3 under a flow of CO2 and in the presence of triethanolamine, TEOA (a reducing agent) and mesitylene (an internal standard) with blue light (λ = 466 nm) resulted in the formation of formate as the product of CO2 reduction, which displays a 1H NMR signal at 8.45 ppm (Fig. 5). Two other signals were also observed at 8.08 and 8.04 ppm, which correspond to N-(2-hydroxyethyl)formamide (HEF) and N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)formamide (BHEF), respectively (Fig. S73†). These two species appear as result of formate reacting with the hydrolyzed products of oxidized TEOA (Scheme 3), as the photoreduction operates under non-anhydrous conditions.29 Integration of the NMR signals and normalization with respect to the mesitylene internal standard provided kinetic plots (Fig. S74–S81†) for the three CO2-photoreduced species. Fig. 6a displays the kinetic plot of the total CO2-reduced products over 120 h utilizing MIL-125-NHMe and MIL-125-NHhep. Similar to the trend in photoabsorption and the bandgap, the increased number of carbon atoms in the N-alkyl chain results in increased photocatalytic activity, with turnover numbers at 120 h between 0.284 for MIL-125-NHMe and 1.151 for MIL-125-NHhep. For comparison purposes, we measured the concentration of formate with our photoreactor ([formate] = 0.165 mmol L−1 at t = 12 h) and compared it to the observations of Li et al. ([formate] = 0.136 mmol L−1 at t = 10 h),17 resulting in very similar values, providing a validation to our approach. Fitting polynomial functions to the concentration-based kinetic plot, followed by evaluation at t = 0 h of their first derivative, allowed us to obtain the initial rate of the photoreduction. The initial rates for all the MOFs were utilized to obtain an apparent quantum yield (Φapp, also referred to as photonic efficiency25) using eqn (2). In this work we use the term apparent quantum yield for two reasons: first, the ratio of light absorption/scattering by the MOF is not accounted for (i.e. we assume complete light absorption), and second, because the kinetic plots account for two side reactions (amide formation) that occur after the photocatalytic step. As shown in Fig. 6b, secondary N-alkyls, isopropyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl (Fig. 6b blue histograms) display a larger Φapp (1.5–1.8%) than the primary N-alkyls (0.30–0.40%, Fig. 6b orange histograms); especially MIL-125-NHCyp, which displayed the largest apparent quantum yield Φapp = 1.80%. The increased catalytic activity is consistent with the increased excited-state lifetime and decreased bandgap for the secondary alkyl substituent species.

It is noteworthy to emphasize that we observed no trend or correlation between the photocatalytic rates/efficiency and the gas adsorption properties of the MOFs. We believe that electronic effects from N-alkyl substitution determine the photocatalytic efficiency with little effect from mass transport. This assessment is consistent with the reaction mechanism proposed by Fu et al.,17 who propose that upon photoexcitation, an electron is promoted from the π-cloud in terephthalate to a Ti d-state and is further transferred to CO2, reducing it to formate. The MOF catalyst is then regenerated by oxidizing TEOA (the latter also serving as a proton source). Our observed correlation between the excited-state lifetime and apparent quantum yield suggests that the rate-limiting step of the reduction is the electron transfer from Ti+3 to CO2 competing with charge recombination of the MOF. The chemical stability of the MIL-125-NHR MOFs was assessed by PXRD and 1H NMR after 120 h of photoreaction. No changes in the PXRD patterns were observed, suggesting the stability of the crystalline framework (Fig. S9†). Moreover, only marginal linker decomposition was observed in the 1H NMR spectra of the base-digested MOFs. The reusability of the MOF photocatalysts was assessed by re-exposing MIL-125-NHCyp for a second photocatalytic run for another 120 h, observing a less than 5% variation in the concentration of reduced CO2 species, indicating photochemical stability after reuse (Fig. S83†). Future work includes studying the effect of other reductants (e.g. alcohols, hydrogen) and more complex substitutions, such as including tertiary N-alkyls and π-donors that will increase the lifetime of the excited state also induce smaller bandgaps.
Conclusion
We prepared an isoreticular series of titanium-based MOF photocatalysts by increasing the N-alkyl substitution in MIL-125-NHR, where R varies from methyl, to ethyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and n-heptyl. The isoreticular nature of their crystal structure was studied by powder X-ray crystallography and gas adsorption. Their photophysical and photocatalytic properties were studied displaying a gradual decrease in the optical bandgap from 2.56 eV in MIL-125-NH2 to 2.29 eV in MIL-125-NHCy, consistent with increased electron density around the organic linker via inductive effects of the N-alkyl chain. We explored the photocatalytic efficiency of the MOFs towards the reduction of carbon dioxide under blue LED light, displaying increased reaction rates and quantum yields consistent with the increased alkyl substitution. We observed that the CO2 photoreduction quantum yield is higher for MOFs with increased excited-state lifetime, particularly with secondary N-alkyl substituents, and concluded that from the current proposed mechanism, the electron transfer from Ti+3 to CO2 is the rate-limiting step in the photoreduction. This study allowed us to understand how small variations in the organic linker of the MOF can result in tuning of the photophysical and photocatalytic properties of the materials, solely by selection of specific substituents in the organic links.
