    , Accepted 21st June 2012First published on 25th June 2012AbstractOrganic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) can convert injected charge into photons. The upper conversion limit of single-unit OLEDs is at most one photon per injected electron. Alternatively, tandem OLEDs that vertically stack several single-unit OLEDs via charge generation layers (CGLs) can convert one injected electron into multiple photons, thus achieving greater brightness and current efficiency with a lower current. However, since the driving voltage consumed by conventional tandem devices scales linearly with the number of electroluminescent units, the resulting power consumption would be the same for both the single-unit and tandem OLEDs to obtain the same luminescence; this means that the power efficiency cannot be greatly increased for such tandem devices. Recently we found that using buffer-modified intrinsic organic semiconductor heterojunctions (OHJs) as the CGLs significantly enhanced the power efficiency of the fabricated tandem OLEDs, which was previously suggested to be difficult for tandem devices. In this feature article, we review the recent advances of tandem OLEDs based on OHJs as the CGLs, including the design concept and basic requirements of the energy levels and mobility of involved organic semiconductors. Our results show that the use of OHJs as CGLs is a universal concept for the fabrication of tandem OLEDs with high power efficiency. We believe that the concept of OHJs opens new perspectives for the rational design of CGLs to realize tandem devices with unprecedented improvement in power efficiency. In particular, it has great potential for use in the fabrication of tandem white OLEDs (WOLEDs) for solid-state-lighting.Yonghua ChenDr Yonghua Chen received his BE degree in chemistry from Inner Mongolia University in 2006 and then joined Dr Dongge Ma's group at Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), where he obtained his Ph.D. in polymer chemistry and physics in 2011.

1. Introduction
Organic optoelectronics have been highlighted as being low-cost and environmentally friendly for potential real world commercial applications.1 Since the breakthrough by Kodak in 1987,2 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are one of the most successful technologies with promising commercial prospects for future displays and solid state lighting. More importantly, OLEDs can be fabricated on thin, large, and flexible substrates, making them ideal for “wallpaper-style” lighting sources.3
In order to achieve high external quantum efficiency and enough luminance for illumination purposes, tandem OLEDs have emerged as a viable alternative to standard OLEDs. Tandem OLEDs are technologically interesting because not only can the luminance and current efficiency be improved linearly with the number of electroluminescent (EL) units in the tandem OLED, but also leakage current and breakdown of the electric field can be avoided due to the higher luminance at a low current density and the thicker organic films, resulting in a long lifetime.4–23 Since the first tandem OLED based on n-doped/p-doped organic junctions and n-doped organic/transition metal oxide junctions was reported by Kido in 2003,4 the interest in this field has risen steadily for both technological and scientific reasons. In a tandem OLED, all of the individual EL units are electrically connected in series via a charge generation layer (CGL) between adjacent EL units.4–23 The CGL plays a critical role in the realization of high-performance tandem OLEDs since it functions as both an internal anode and a cathode to generate intrinsic charge carriers and to facilitate opposite electrons and holes being injected into the adjacent sub-OLED units.
Since the CGLs in tandem OLEDs are known to have an important influence on the device performance, extensive efforts have been made to explore high efficiency CGLs. These typically consist of a p–n junction such as doped organic/metal oxide bilayer structures including Cs:2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP)/ITO or V2O5,4,5 Mg:tris(8-quinolinolato) aluminum(III) (Alq3)/WO3,7,10 Li:BCP/V2O5 or MoO3,8,24 Cs2CO3:Alq3/MoO3,11 and CsN3:4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BPhen)/MoO3,22 doped organic/doped organic bilayer structures including Li:Alq3/FeCl3:4,4′-N,N′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (NPB),6 Cs:BPhen/tetrafluorotetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ):NPB,13 Mg:Alq3/F4-TCNQ:4,4′,4′′-tris{N,-(3-methylphenyl)-N-phenylamino}-triphenylamine (m-MTDATA),14 Bphen:Rb2CO3/NPB:ReO3 or Bphen:Rb2CO3/ReO3/NPB:ReO3,19 and TR-E314:Li/LGC101:NPB,21 doped organic/organic bilayer structures such as Li:Alq3/1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN),18,20 and undoped examples like LiF/Ca/Ag or LiF/Al/Au,9 Li2O,15 hexadecafluorophthalocyanine (F16CuPc)/copper phthalocyanine (CuPc),16 and Al/WO3/Au.17 The utilization of these CGLs greatly enhances the luminance and current efficiency, demonstrating the merits of tandem OLEDs. Furthermore, the understanding of the operational mechanism of CGLs has gradually been revealed.14,25–37 Tsutsui and co-workers34 first proposed a model of charge-carrier separation at the interface between Mg:Alq3 and V2O5 thin films to demonstrate the charge generation process in the Mg:Alq3/V2O5 CGL. Law et al.14 then used the large energy shift at the interface due to the presence of a large space-charge zone in Mg:Alq3 and F4-TCNQ:m-MTDATA CGLs to reveal this process. Additionally, Kröger and co-workers37 explained the charge separation process in Li:1,2,5-tris(N-phenylbezimidazol-2-yl) benzene (TPBi)/F4-TCNQ:4,4′,4′′-tris-N-phenylamino-triphenylamine (1-TNATA) CGL by electron tunneling from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) states of the p-type doping layer to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) states of the n-type doping layer through a narrow depletion zone. More recently, Hamwi et al.,25 Meyer et al.,27 and Bao et al.,26,28 simultaneously demonstrated that the charge transfer from the transition metal oxide to its neighboring hole-transport layer should be the real mechanism of charge generation in CGL for metal oxides. In this case, the adjacent n-type doping layer only plays the role of an electron injection layer that facilitates injection of electrons generated in the CGL into the adjacent EL unit.
In reported tandem OLEDs, however, problems still remain including complicated processing and limited material combination. The sophisticated and high-cost doping metal ions, e.g., Li or Cs, and the organic molecules, e.g., F4-TCNQ, used in CGLs easily quench the excitons, thus greatly reducing the device efficiency.38–41 Furthermore, the power efficiency, which is one key to the commercial realization of a lighting source, is not enhanced in tandem OLEDs since the driven voltage consumed by conventional tandem OLEDs scales linearly with the number of EL units, meaning that the driven voltage in tandem OLEDs is doubled. Though several factors, including a reduced quenching effect from the electrodes, an improved charge recombination balance, and a reduced charge-exciton quenching effect, may contribute to the enhancement of power efficiency,20 the tandem OLEDs still do not provide a significant improvement in power efficiency; e.g., Tang et al. reported 30–40% enhancement,6 Forrest et al. reported 10–15% enhancement,12 and Liao and Klubek reported 40–50% enhancement.20
Regardless of which architectures and techniques we use to create tandem OLEDs, the core is still the CGL since the charge generation, transport, and extraction/injection are associated with the intrinsic physical processes within the CGLs. Accordingly, a large power efficiency improvement in tandem OLEDs will be achieved only if the CGL has excellent charge generation, transport, and extraction/injection capabilities, which allows for a negligible voltage drop across the CGL.
In this feature article, we present the novel concept of organic semiconductor heterojunctions (OHJs) for use as CGLs to improve the power efficiency in tandem OLEDs. We start with the operation of tandem OLEDs, followed by some basic concepts of OHJs and how this concept works in the fabrication of tandem OLEDs. We then review our recent experimental results on tandem OLEDs based on OHJs as CGLs, organized into four sections: (i) bilayer OHJs as the CGLs in tandem OLEDs, (ii) bulk OHJs as the CGLs in tandem OLEDs, (iii) the effects of the interfacial energy level and the mobility of charge carriers on the performance of tandem OLEDs, and (iv) the high-performance tandem white OLEDs with OHJs as the CGLs.
2. Operation of tandem OLEDs
2.1 Structures and characteristics of tandem OLEDs
The concept of tandem OLEDs was first proposed by Kido et al.4 As the name suggests, tandem OLEDs are fabricated by vertically stacking two or more individual EL units, each with a hole-injecting layer/hole-transporting layer/light-emitting layer/electron-transporting layer/electron-injection layer structure, driven entirely by a single power source. As shown in Fig. 1(b), all of the EL units in the tandem OLED are electrically connected in series by inserting a CGL between adjacent EL units.
 Fig. 1  Schematic structures of (a) single-unit OLEDs with a single EL unit and (b) tandem OLEDs with two EL units connected by a CGL. 
It is well known that the whole EL process in OLEDs is accomplished by charge injection, transport, recombination to form excitons, and finally radiation decay to light.2 Accordingly, the light intensity is gradually increased with an increasing number of excitons. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the upper conversion limit of single-unit OLEDs is at most one photon per injected electron. For the tandem OLED in Fig. 1(b), however, two photons can be generated by injecting an electron–hole pair since they can be recombined with the generated hole and electron from the CGL. Compared to a single-unit OLED, the tandem OLEDs can achieve higher luminance and current efficiency, which scales linearly with the number of the stacked EL units.4–23 Due to the fact that multiple EL units are stacked together, the tandem OLEDs need only about 1/N (N, the number of EL units) times the current density used in the single-unit OLED to obtain the same luminance, which results in an N fold increase in operational lifetime over that of a single-unit OLED. Furthermore, today's state-of-the-art tandem OLEDs can vertically stack either individual red, green, and blue emission units or multiple white emission units in series via CGLs to achieve white emission. Combined with the high efficiency and long lifetime, tandem white OLEDs have great potential in the fields of display and solid-state lighting.8,10,12,15,42–46
2.2 Criteria of CGLs
There are four criteria for the formation of a highly efficient CGL in a tandem OLED to achieve high performance. Firstly, the charge generation needs to be effectively carried out in the CGL, typically coming from the charge transfer from a p-type semiconductor to an n-type semiconductor at the interface of a p–n junction.25–28,30,33 Secondly, it is necessary to rapidly transport the generated electrons and holes along the CGL toward the respective EL unit. Upon application of an external electric field, rapid transport is expected. Note that the generated electrons and holes should be rapidly transported in a low electric field in order to avoid charge accumulation at the interface of the CGL. This requires that the materials used to construct the CGLs should have high mobility or conductivity. Thirdly, the electrons and holes transported to the CGL/EL unit interface should be effectively injected into the respective EL unit. The low injection barrier height from the CGL to the respective electron- and hole-transporting layer in the EL unit is necessary. This means that the CGL energy levels must match well with the respective electron- and hole-transporting layer in the EL unit. Finally, the CGL should have a high optical transmission in the visible spectral range. As well known, all the organic layers contained in the EL units are generally optically transparent to the emitted light from each EL unit; therefore, their transparency is not generally a concern for the construction of tandem OLEDs. Comparatively, the optical transmission of the CGL is very important. In fact, if the optical transmission of a CGL is less than 70%, then the tandem OLED cannot double the efficiency.36 Therefore, in order to greatly enhance the efficiency of tandem OLEDs, the transmittance of the CGLs must be at least 75%.47 This clearly elucidates the importance of high optical transmission of the CGL in tandem OLEDs.
3. Basics of organic semiconductor heterojunctions
Here we introduce a few basic concepts about organic semiconductor heterojunctions necessary for the following discussion. It is well known that semiconductors are defined by their unique electric conductivity behaviors, and can be classified into p-type and n-type semiconductors. A semiconductor heterojunction is the interface that occurs between p-type and n-type semiconductors, it is always advantageous to engineer the electronic energy bands in many solid state devices, including semiconductor light-emitting diodes, lasers, solar cells, and transistors. In fact, the concept of semiconductor heterojunctions had already been proposed in 195148,49 and the energy-band profiles follow the Anderson model.50 To date, all inorganic optoelectronic devices are based on this kind of semiconductor heterojunction. The most familiar heterojunction type in inorganic semiconductors is the depletion mode. In this type of heterojunction, a depletion junction is formed on either side of the heterojunction interface; namely, the positive charges are accumulated on the n-type side and the negative charges are accumulated on the p-type side in the depletion region. In this case, the internal electric field is opposite to the external field and the charges in the depletion region are immovable. However, the case of a heterojunction consisting of two organic semiconductors is somewhat different. The organic semiconductor heterojunction (OHJ)51,52 (i.e., n-type and p-type organic semiconductors) is a promising electronic system for charge recombination in OLEDs,2 for charge separation in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs),53 and for charge accumulation in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)54 owing to the energy mismatch between the frontier orbitals of the two organic semiconductors. Because the dielectric constant of the organic semiconductor is usually low and the noncovalent electronic interactions between organic semiconductors are weak compared to inorganic semiconductors,55 two types of anisotype heterojunctions may be formed: accumulation and depletion heterojunctions.56 The depletion heterojunction in organic semiconductors is similar to that in inorganic semiconductors, however, the accumulation heterojunction is completely different. In this case, the positive and negative charges are accumulated on the p-type and n-type sides, respectively, of the organic semiconductor to form the space charge region. We call this phenomenon a heterojunction effect, which has been well demonstrated in OFETs and OPVs exhibiting highly efficient device performance.54,57–62 The direction of the built-in voltage is from the p-type region to the n-type region. More importantly, the accumulated charges within the charge region are movable.56 The accumulation of high density free charge carriers results in a high conductivity along the junction direction. We expect that the special properties of OHJs should also be favorable to charge generation in the CGLs of tandem OLEDs.
4. Organic semiconductor heterojunctions as CGLs in high performance tandem OLEDs
We fabricated tandem OLEDs with OHJs as the CGLs, and studied the two cases of p/n bilayer OHJ63 and bulk OHJ.64,65 It was found that the energy level position and the charge carrier mobility of the organic materials in the OHJ CGL play very important roles in charge generation and transport and, ultimately, the performance of fabricated tandem OLEDs.66 It is necessary that the Fermi level of the p-type organic semiconductor be higher than that of the n-type organic semiconductor to effectively generate charges, and that the mobility of the organic materials in the CGL should be high to effectively transport charges. It can be seen that using an OHJ as the CGL can not only double the luminance and current efficiency, but, more importantly, greatly improve the power efficiency which has previously been suggested to be difficult to do for tandem devices.4–23 On the basis of OHJ CGLs, we also fabricated tandem white OLEDs67 where the power efficiency and efficiency roll-off are significantly improved. The detailed results are described below.
4.1. Bilayer OHJs as CGLs in tandem OLEDs

4.1.1 Design concept. 
The operation of CGLs is related to three processes: charge generation, charge transport, and charge extraction/injection. To be able to effectively achieve and manipulate these processes in OHJ CGLs, we select C60/pentacene as an example to elucidate these processes. On the basis of the theory of thermal emission of electrons, the electron transfer from pentacene to C60 can be achieved since pentacene has a higher Fermi level than C60 in the flat band state (Fig. 2 left).68,69 In fact, several groups have successfully described the electronic structures of the C60/pentacene OHJ.68–71 The fact that the interfacial dipole is formed at the interface is well established.68–70 In reality, the interfacial dipole may originate from interfacial charge-transfer, polarization effects induced by an asymmetric electronic density distribution, interfacial chemical reaction, and alignment of charge neutrality levels.26,72–74 Also, recent theoretical simulation shows that the abrupt imbalance in molecular quadrupoles could be the origin of the dipole formation in the C60/pentacene heterojunction.70 The interfacial dipole formation is beneficial to the energy level alignment of the C60/pentacene interface, thus facilitating the electron-transfer from pentacene to C60 that has been observed previously.68,69 Also noted is that this charge transfer in turn contributes to the interfacial energy level equilibrium. Benefiting from the charge redistribution, the electrons and holes can be accumulated on n-type C60 and p-type pentacene, respectively, in the vicinity of the C60/pentacene interface (Fig. 2 middle). Therefore, high-density free electrons and holes are provided at the C60/pentacene junction (Fig. 2 right); i.e., charge generation occurs. Charge carriers should then move away from the C60/pentacene interface in opposite directions under an external electric field since C60 and molecular pentacene have high electron and hole mobilities, thus the electrons and holes will not pile up at the interface causing a high voltage drop. In fact, the large injection barriers remain between the C60 and the electron-transporting layer and between the pentacene and the hole-transporting layer. In our tandem devices, LiF and MoO3 buffer layers are introduced to modify C60 and pentacene, respectively. This strategy is selected since LiF and MoO3 are widely used as the electron injection and hole injection materials in OLEDs,75–79 which is strikingly different from the previous report by Rao et al.23 Herein we note that an effective charge extraction is also essential for an improvement in power efficiency.

4.1.2 Device design and performance. 
We fabricated a tandem OLED using a C60/pentacene OHJ, and a single-unit OLED was used as a comparison. Fig. 3 depicts the schematic diagrams of the corresponding single-unit and tandem OLEDs. The hole and electron transport layers are NPB and Alq3, respectively. The emission layer is Alq3:10-(2-benzothiazolyl)-1,1,7,7-tetramethyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H,5H,11H-[1]benzopyrano[6,7,8-ij]quinolizin-11-one (C545T). We fixed the concentration of C545T at 1 wt% in Alq3 host.
 Fig. 3  Schematic diagram of the single-unit (left) and tandem (right) devices. The molecular structures of C60, pentacene, ZnPc, CuPc, and H2Pc are shown at the top-left. The structures of the single-unit and tandem OLEDs are ITO/MoO3(6 nm)/NPB(90 nm)/Alq3:C545T(30 nm)/Alq3(30 nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al(120 nm) and ITO/MoO3(6 nm)/NPB(90 nm)/Alq3:C545T(30 nm)/Alq3(30 nm)/LiF(0.3 nm)/n-type layer (20 nm)/p-type layer (15 nm)/MoO3(3 nm)/NPB(50 nm)/Alq3:C545T(30 nm)/Alq3(30 nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al(120 nm), respectively. It is noted that the single-unit device structure shown here has been optimized. 

Fig. 4 compares the EL characteristics of the C60/pentacene-based tandem OLED and the single-unit control OLED. It can be seen from Fig. 4(a) that our tandem device exhibits a lower operational voltage, and the operational voltage ratio of our tandem device to the single-unit device gradually decreases with increasing current density and luminance. This demonstrates that the C60/pentacene OHJ exhibits remarkable characteristics as a connecting unit in tandem OLEDs. As a result, not only is the current efficiency greatly enhanced from 15.2 cd A−1 for the single-unit device to 38 cd A−1 for the tandem device (Fig. 4(b)), but the power efficiency of the tandem device is significantly improved, e.g., tandemmax: 21.9 lm W−1versus single-unitmax: 10.1 lm W−1 (Fig. 4(c)). This gives the best power efficiency improvement reported so far for tandem devices without any out-coupling technique,80–82 making the C60/pentacene OHJ CGL far superior to conventional CGLs.4–23 Even at high luminance, the power efficiency enhancement is still significant; for example, under 1000 cd m−2, 10000 cd m−2, and 38000 cd m−2, the power efficiency enhancements are 1.74, 1.81, and 1.9 times that of the optimized single-unit, respectively. To further demonstrate the merit of this novel CGL, we compare our C60/pentacene OHJ CGL to the conventional well-investigated n-doped organic/transition metal oxide junction CGLs Li:BCP/MoO3 and Li:BCP/MoO3:NPB.24 As shown in Fig. 5, both of the optimized devices based on the two conventional CGLs achieved a twofold enhancement in current efficiency (Fig. 5(a), 31.7 cd A−1 and 31 cd A−1 for Li:BCP/MoO3 and Li:BCP/MoO3:NPB, respectively), but showed little improvement in power efficiency compared to the single-unit counterpart (Fig. 5(b), 11.6 lm W−1 and 11.3 lm W−1 for Li:BCP/MoO3 and Li:BCP/MoO3:NPB, respectively). These results fully demonstrate the advantages of OHJs as CGLs. Actually, when the pentacene is replaced by H2Pc, ZnPc, or CuPc, similar power efficiency improvements can also be achieved. Table 1 summarizes the detailed EL performance of all the devices discussed here. It can be seen that our OHJ CGL indeed exhibits excellent EL performance compared to conventional ones. We note that the notable power efficiency improvement in our tandem device based on OHJ CGLs is the key difference compared to the previously reported CGLs,4–23 where it was suggested to be difficult to achieve improvement in the high power efficiency.

4.1.3 Analysis of power efficiency improvement. 
The power efficiency improvement in the C60/pentacene-based tandem devices can be clarified by a complete understanding of the charge generation, transport, and extraction/injection occurring in the CGL. The direct experimental evidence is provided by investigating the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics of the designed devices. Device 1 is one of the simplest reference devices. The C60/pentacene OHJ is inserted between Alq3 and NPB in device 2. In device 3, the LiF and MoO3 buffer layer is further added to modify the electron- and hole-injecting interface between Alq3 and C60 and between NPB and pentacene, respectively. For the purpose of avoiding the leakage current related to defects and pinholes which blocks the charge injection from the outside electrodes in all devices, we designed the LiF layers (serving as insulating layers) to be 100 nm thick and located at the two electrodes. As shown in Fig. 6, device 1 exhibits no change in capacitance with the applied voltages from −20 V to 20 V. This constant capacitance indicates that the LiF film indeed acted as an effective insulator layer and completely blocked charge injection from the ITO and Al external electrodes in this voltage range. Furthermore, it also indicates that neither the displacement nor the generation of charges within the interface of NPB and Alq3 occurs. Compared to the non-CGL-equipped device 1, device 2 exhibited a gradual increase of capacitance above 5 V. We attribute this increased capacitance to the effective charge transfer from pentacene to C60 due to the exceptionally strong acceptor characteristic of C60 molecules and the close energy levels of C60 and pentacene.83 This fact conclusively proves that an electric-field-induced charge generation process takes place at the C60/pentacene interface.34,35,37

The device structures are ITO/LiF(100 nm)/Alq3(30 nm)/NPB(50 nm)/LiF(100 nm)/Al(120 nm) (device 1), ITO/LiF(100 nm)/Alq3(30 nm)/C60(20 nm)/pentacene(15 nm)/NPB(50 nm)/LiF(100 nm)/Al(120 nm) (device 2), ITO/LiF(100 nm)/Alq3(30 nm)/LiF(0.3 nm)/C60(20 nm)/pentacene(15 nm)/MoO3(3 nm)/NPB(50 nm)/LiF(100 nm)/Al(120 nm) (device 3), ITO/LiF(100 nm)/Alq3(30 nm)/Li:BCP (20 nm)/MoO3(3 nm)/NPB(50 nm)/LiF(100 nm)/Al(120 nm) (device 4), and ITO/LiF(100 nm)/Alq3(30 nm)/Li:BCP (20 nm)/MoO3:NPB (40 nm)/NPB(50 nm)/LiF(100 nm)/Al(120 nm) (device 5). 
As known, the charge generation is a prerequisite for the operation of CGLs. However, the generated charge carriers have to be extracted out of the CGL and then injected into the adjacent sub-OLEDs. Previous reports only emphasized the charge generation process. Herein we note that an effective charge extraction, including transport and injection, is also essential, in particular, for the improvement of power efficiency. The effective transport means that the organic materials used in CGLs have to possess high mobility. In our OHJ CGLs, we used C60 as the n-type part and pentacene, H2Pc, CuPc and ZnPc as the p-type part, which show high electron mobility and hole mobility, respectively. Additionally, they meet this strict high mobility requirement intrinsically, without additional doping.84,85
As we see in our tandem OLEDs, large injection barriers still remain between C60 and Alq3 and between pentacene and NPB (LUMOs: 3.0 eV for Alq3 and 4.5 eV for C60, HOMOs: 5.5 eV for NPB and 4.9 eV for pentacene).76,83 To realize effective injection of generated electrons and holes into the corresponding EL units across these high barriers in our tandem OLEDs, we used thin LiF and thin MoO3 as the buffer layers at both sides of the C60/pentacene OHJ. As shown in Fig. 4(c), without either layer of LiF and MoO3, the power efficiency of the resulting devices cannot be enhanced, indicating the important role of the LiF and MoO3 buffer layers in reducing voltage, thus improving power efficiency. The C–V examinations are used to support this point. As shown in Fig. 6, compared to the non-buffer-modified device 2, the turn-on voltage of the capacitance increase in device 3 (equipped with buffer layers on both sides of the C60/pentacene heterojunction) diminishes from 5 V to 0 V, and the magnitude of the capacitance increase is much larger in device 3. The results indeed show the significant role of LiF and MoO3 buffer layers in reducing the barrier height, thus greatly facilitating the charge injection from C60/pentacene into the adjacent corresponding EL units. Apparently, the significant power efficiency improvement in our tandem devices comes from the efficient and excellent collaboration of charge generation, transport, and extraction that occur in the OHJ CGLs.
The C–V examinations also confirmed why the buffer-modified OHJ CGLs were superior to both the traditional n-doped organic/transition metal oxide and the n-doped/p-doped organic junction CGLs. As shown in Fig. 6, the turn-on voltage of the capacitance is increased in device 4 (based on BCP:Li/MoO3) and 5 (based on BCP:Li/NPB:MoO3) by 3 V over that of device 3 (based on LiF/C60/pentacene/MoO3), while the capacitance values of device 4 and 5 are less than 50% that of device 3 under the same bias. This fact demonstrates that the interface-modified OHJ CGLs are able to generate more charge carriers than conventional CGLs, allowing for a reduction of driven voltage and thus a significant enhancement in power efficiency in tandem devices.


4.1.4 Device stability. 
Tandem OLEDs have been demonstrated to have superior stability compared to their single-unit OLED counterparts.10,15,18 Our tandem OLEDs based on OHJs as the CGLs also showed good stability. As an example, we tested the stability of the tandem OLEDs based on C60/pentacene OHJ CGLs by a simple process. We first tested the electrical properties of the fabricated tandem device in a glove box, and then tested the same device in an ambient atmosphere after different time intervals including 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h. The test results are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that the characteristics of current density–voltage–luminance (Fig. 7(a)), current efficiency–current density (Fig. 7(b)), and power efficiency–current density (Fig. 7(c)) are consistent with each other under different testing conditions. This should indicate that these are extremely efficient devices that apparently show no drop in efficiency in air over periods of up to 6 h without any encapsulation. Moreover, we took photos of the devices at various time periods and there are no pin holes or dark spots beginning to form over time (not shown). It is concluded that our tandem devices are stable, reliable, and reproducible.

Looking at these OHJ CGLs here, we only used pure material combinations in which the sophisticated doping process is avoided. More importantly, the fast charge transport and efficient charge extraction significantly reduce the series electrical resistance and thus the Joule heating effect, which represents another merit of our OHJ CGLs.


4.1.5 Influence of photo-generated charge carriers. 
Since the OHJs like the C60/pentacene used as CGLs in our tandem devices are widely used in organic solar cells, we know they show photovoltaic effects as well, i.e. generating charges at optical irradiation.83,86,87 To confirm whether or not there are photo-generated charge carriers in our OHJ CGLs, we conducted the following experiments. Scheme 1 shows the schematic illustration of the experimental setup used to study this. A CNI S-GDL-532 CW green diode laser with an output power density of 15 mW cm−2 was used as a simulation light source, which is close to the emission wavelength (524 nm) of our tandem devices. To separate the contribution from the laser when testing the luminance of the devices, we always ran the background as a baseline first to eliminate the 532 nm laser that may influence the results. We examined the current density and the luminance of the devices with and without green laser light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 8(a), upon green laser light irradiation the device shows lower turn-on voltage (4.3 V) compared to that of the device without green laser light irradiation (4.9 V), demonstrating that photo-induced charge carriers are generated in the OHJ CGL by the green laser light irradiation owing to the photovoltaic effects of C60/pentacene OHJs.83 It can be seen that the overall current density of the device with green laser light irradiation is higher than that of the device without green laser light irradiation. Because of the generation of the additional charge carriers in the CGL, the luminance of the device with green laser light irradiation is also higher than that of the device without green laser light irradiation. As shown in Fig. 8(b), therefore, the current efficiency of the device with green laser light irradiation is higher than that of the device without green laser light irradiation in the low current region. This result elucidates that the induced charges by the light irradiation can be converted into photons more efficiently. The nearly identical efficiencies in the high current region can probably be attributed to the fact that the electric field induced charges and the charges generated by the light irradiation of the device itself play the main role in charge generation, while the role of laser irradiation is weak. On the other hand, as we have shown above, the driven voltage of the device is reduced (Fig. 8(a)) and the power efficiency is significantly increased (Fig. 8(c)) for the device under laser light irradiation. This demonstrates that the charges generated by photovoltaic effects indeed play an certain role in increasing the charges in the CGL when using an OHJ with photovoltaic effects, although it is hard to accurately evaluate how much this effect contributes to the power efficiency enhancement.

To demonstrate the real role of photovoltaic effects in our tandem devices, we replaced the p-type organic semiconductor pentacene with 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1′-biphenyl (CBP) in the OHJ CGL, which has no absorption in the green zone (Fig. 9(a)). As shown in Fig. 9(b), the power efficiency of the resulting C60/CBP-based tandem device is also almost double the power efficiency of the single-unit device (18.2 lm W−1versus 10.1 lm W−1), providing another effective OHJ CGL. Furthermore, whether the C60/CBP-based tandem device is with or without green-light (532 nm) irradiation, little change is observed in the characteristics of current density–luminance–voltage (Fig. 9(c)), current efficiency–current density (Fig. 9(d)), and power efficiency–current density (Fig. 9(e)). On the basis of these results, we confidently recognize that the real cause of the greatly improved power efficiency in our OHJ CGL-based tandem OLEDs was mainly due to the effective charge generation effect in OHJs by electric field induction, which was determined by the relative energy levels of both components in the OHJ. Of course, if we use a OHJ like the C60/pentacene as the CGL, the photovoltaic effects also have certain contributions to the improvement of device performance, but no determining factor.

4.1.6 Other bilayer CGLs. 
As we showed in Table 1, using H2Pc, ZnPc, and CuPc instead of pentacene to form OHJs with C60 also leads to an effective charge generation, thus improving power efficiency of the resulting tandem OLEDs. Fig. 10 gives the EL performance of tandem OLEDs based on C60/ZnPc, C60/CuPc, or C60/H2Pc as the CGLs. It is clearly seen that besides the luminance and current efficiency being doubled, the power efficiency is also greatly enhanced, reaching 21 lm W−1, 18.6 lm W−1, and 16.1 lm W−1 in C60/ZnPc, C60/CuPc, and C60/H2Pc-based tandem OLEDs, respectively. As we know, H2Pc, ZnPc, and CuPc have similar energy levels to pentacene,88–90 allowing for the effective charge transfer from H2Pc, ZnPc, and CuPc to C60. This means that H2Pc, ZnPc, and CuPc can also form the accumulation junction with C60, leading to a more effective charge generation. In fact, the ground state electron transfer from ZnPc, CuPc, or H2Pc to C60 has been investigated by UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.91,92 Moreover, H2Pc, ZnPc, and CuPc have also been verified to have high hole mobilities.84,93,94 This also explains why H2Pc, ZnPc, and CuPc can play the same role as pentacene in the effective charge generation as they construct the OHJ CGLs with C60. Our results indicate that the OHJ-based CGLs are a universal concept in improving the power efficiency of tandem OLEDs. Clearly, the relative energy levels of both semiconductor components are very important for the CGL construction, which directly determines the charge generation and EL performance of the fabricated tandem OLEDs.

Unlike previous reports in which only one extreme material combination is suitable to serve as a CGL in tandem devices, we herein propose a concept under which several material combinations can be used to realize the power efficiency enhancement in tandem devices. In fact, we used C60/pentacene, C60/H2Pc, C60/ZnPc, and C60/CuPc as examples to elucidate our concept. Actually, we have successfully fabricated tandem OLEDs with world record enhancements in power efficiency by introducing another series of material combinations.66 We are confident that the concept proposed here will open a novel avenue for achieving high performance tandem OLEDs in the future.

4.2 Bulk OHJs as CGLs in tandem OLEDs

4.2.1 Design concept. 
We found that the charge generation originating from the charge transfer from p-type organic semiconductor to n-type organic semiconductor is a prerequisite and is very important to the OHJ CGL operation. For the bilayer OHJ CGL systems, the charge generation occurs at the narrow interface between two organic semiconductors, which may limit the generation of charge carriers and also cause the accumulation of the generated charge carriers. Accordingly, we designed bulk heterojunctions as CGLs, which have widely been used in organic solar cells (OSCs),95–98 to realize high performance tandem OLEDs.
Forming bulk OHJs by blending the donor and acceptor organic materials was first proposed by Heeger,95 and have been widely used to achieve high-efficiency OSCs where the blend of a p-type organic semiconductor and an n-type organic semiconductor shows phase states of only several nanometers in microcosmic sizes, leading to an easily effective carrier diffusion. Up until now, almost all high-performance OSCs were fabricated by using bulk OHJs, e.g., ZnPc:C60,96 PCDTBT:PC70BM,97 and PTB7:PC71BM.98 Furthermore, double channel OFETs have recently been demonstrated employing bulk OHJs,99–102 exhibiting excellent bipolar characteristics. The bipolar charge generation characteristics of the bulk OHJs imply that the bulk OHJs could also be used as excellent CGLs for the fabrication of high performance tandem OLEDs.103,104


4.2.2 Device structure and performance. 
We proposed a simple CGL by co-evaporating a p-type organic semiconductor and a n-type organic semiconductor. Here, the p-type organic semiconductor we selected was ZnPc and the n-type organic semiconductor was C60 since the best device performance has been achieved in OSCs using a ZnPc:C60 bulk OHJ as the active layer.96Fig. 11 presents the schematic diagram of the cross sectional view of the tandem OLED we fabricated, together with the molecular structures of ZnPc and C60. Both sides of the ZnP:C60 layer were modified by an ultrathin LiF layer and MoO3 layer to facilitate an efficient electron and hole injection, respectively, to the adjacent EL units as we did in the devices with bilayer OHJ CGLs. One key prerequisite for designing the ZnPc:C60 bulk OHJ CGL is the effective control of ratios between ZnPc and C60. Considering the film morphology and transport characteristics, we fixed the ZnPc:C60 blend composition at a weight ratio of 1:1 by optimization. Thus the structure of the fabricated tandem OLEDs based on a ZnPc:C60 bulk OHJ CGL is ITO/MoO3(6 nm)/NPB(90 nm)/Alq3:C545T(30 nm)/Alq3(30 nm)/LiF(0.3 nm)/ZnPc:C60 (1:1, 30 nm)/MoO3(3 nm)/NPB(50 nm)/Alq3:C545T(30 nm)/Alq3(30 nm)/LiF(1 nm)/Al(120 nm).

As shown in Table 2, the maximum current efficiency of the tandem OLEDs using a C60:ZnPc bulk OHJ CGL reached 36.5 cd A−1, which is 2.4 times higher than that of the single-unit device (15.2 cd A−1). In addition to the improvement in current efficiency, the bulk OHJ CGL also significantly improved the power efficiency of the resulting tandem OLED to 21 lm W−1, which is 2 times that of the single-unit device (10.1 lm W−1). These results are similar to those of the bilayer OHJ CGL-based OLEDs. This means that the ZnPc:C60 bulk OHJ can also function as an effective bipolar CGL.

Actually, the ZnPc:C60 bulk OHJ CGL is an incremental step from the bilayer OHJ CGL towards generalization of the concept. However, for the case of the ZnPc:C60 bulk heterojunction CGL, the ZnPc and C60 molecules can sufficiently contact each other, and thus the charge transfer occurs in the whole ZnPc:C60 bulk heterojunction, which is completely different from the bilayer OHJ CGLs where the charge transfer occurs at the interface between two organic semiconductors. This indicates that the charge transfer in bulk heterojunction CGLs should occur more easily than in bilayer OHJ CGLs, thus generating more charges. This is proven by the achievement of higher current and power efficiencies in tandem OLEDs based on ZnPc:C60 bulk OHJ CGLs versus tandem devices with ZnPc/C60 bilayer OHJ CGLs (see Fig. 10 and Table 2).
The charge carrier mobility then begins to play a major role in the bulk OHJs. As we know, the mobility of electrons and holes in bulk OHJs will be lower than those in the pure materials used in bilayer OHJs.84 If the mobility is not sufficiently high, the charge carriers will not be transported rapidly by the external electric field. As a result, the excess charges will recombine again or remain in the device as undesirable space charges that oppose the drift of new charge carriers. The latter problem can occur if the electron and hole mobilities are highly imbalanced such that one species is much more mobile than the other. In this case, the device performance will be worse. In fact, we have found that the mobility of the organic semiconductors used in the OHJ CGLs strongly influenceed the device performance.66 See Section 4.3 for details.
We also tried other bulk OHJs as CGLs (e.g., CuPc:C60 and H2Pc:C60) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design concept of bulk OHJs as CGLs. The CuPc and H2Pc used in our bulk OHJs are also widely used in OSCs, and they have a similar molecular and electronic structure to ZnPc.105,106 By using these to construct bulk OHJs with C60 as the CGLs in tandem OLEDs, we found that a similar power efficiency improvement can also be achieved (Table 2). This indicates that the bulk OHJs as CGLs are also a viable option for the fabrication of high-performance tandem OLEDs.


4.2.3 n-i-p OHJs as CGLs in tandem OLEDs. 
In OSCs, the n-i-p structure consisting of a bulk OHJ sandwiched between homogeneous layers of p-type organic semiconductor and n-type organic semiconductor is also an efficient architecture to construct high-performance OSCs.105 In this case, the charge generation generally occurs in the blending layer, while the pure organic semiconductor layers play the role of charge transport. We also fabricated tandem OLEDs with n-i-p based CGLs. Here we used C60/pentacene:C60/pentacene as the n-i-p structure. Table 3 summaries the device performance. It can be seen that the device performance gradually improves with increasing thickness of the i layer. The tandem device with an i layer thickness of 14 nm shows the best performance with the maximum current efficiency of 32.9 cd A−1 and maximum power efficiency of 15.3 lm W−1. It is clear that the n-i-p OHJ also plays the role of charge generator in the CGL. Because of the introduction of more interfaces in this n-i-p OHJ, it is necessary to optimize the thickness of each layer and the concentration ratio in the i layer so that the optimum device performance can be obtained.

4.3 Effects of interfacial energy level and charge carrier mobility
As shown above, the design concept of OHJs as CGLs is strikingly different from that of the conventional CGLs. The unique cooperation of charge generation, transport, and extraction/injection processes occurring in the OHJs remarkably reduces the operational voltage, rendering an effective method for high power efficiency tandem OLEDs. As demonstrated, it is necessary to first form an accumulation-type space charge region at the OHJ interface where the holes are accumulated on the p-side and the electrons are accumulated on the n-side, and then the separated charge carriers can effectively be transported and injected into the corresponding EL units, which are directly related to the energy levels and the mobility of charge carriers in the OHJs. We used a homologous series of p-type thiophene organic semiconductors NaTn (naphthyl end-capped oligothiophenes, n = 2–6 represents the number of thiophene units, see the inset of Fig. 12(b) for the molecular structures)107,108 as the p-type organic semiconductor in the OHJ CGL to study these effects. The C60 was employed as the n-type organic semiconductor (C60/NaTn) in our devices. The NaTn organic semiconductors possess significant differences in HOMO levels (Fig. 12(a)) and hole mobilities (Fig. 12(b)), which make them suitable for investigating our hypothesis. We fabricated five green tandem OLEDs with NPB/Alq3:C545T/Alq3 active layers based on C60/NaTn OHJ CGLs.
 Fig. 12  (a) Energy levels of NaTn and C60. (b) Hole mobility of NaTn. Inset: molecular structure of NaTn, n = 2–6. The HOMO levels and hole mobilities are obtained from ref. 108. 

Table 4 summaries the detailed EL performance of the five fabricated tandem OLEDs. It can be seen that the current efficiency of the tandem devices is over 2 times that of the single-unit device at a given current density, demonstrating the C60/NaTn OHJs functioned as an effective bipolar CGL. More importantly, the power efficiency of the tandem devices is also remarkably enhanced. The maximum power efficiencies from C60/NaT2- to C60/NaT6-based tandem devices are 17.6 lm W−1, 18.2 lm W−1, 21.5 lm W−1, 18.4 lm W−1, and 20.5 lm W−1, respectively, which are nearly 1.7–2 times that of the single-unit OLED (10.1 lm W−1). This confirms again that our design concept of OHJs as CGLs is a predominant technique for achieving high power efficiency in tandem OLEDs. However, the five tandem devices show a marked difference in luminance and efficiency at the same current density. As shown, the NaT4 leads to the highest efficiency, followed by NaT6, NaT5, NaT3, and NaT2.

This means that the energy levels and the mobility of the C60/NaTn OHJ have strong effects on the performance of the fabricated tandem OLEDs, which are directly related to the processes of charge generation and charge transport. Since the generated charge carriers stem from the electron transfer from the Fermi level of the NaTn to the Fermi level of the C60, the position of the HOMOs of NaTn (ranging from 5.43 eV for NaT2 to 5.12 eV for NaT6 (Fig. 12(a))108 relative to the LUMO of C60 probably contributes to the different capabilities of charge generation in the C60/NaTn CGLs. To further elucidate this problem, we fabricated capacitor devices based on C60/NaTn and measured their C–V characteristics, which are shown in Fig. 13(a). It is clearly seen that the capacitance is gradually decreased with increasing energy-level difference between the HOMOs of NaTn and the LUMO of C60 in the saturation regime, as shown in Fig. 13(b). Because the magnitude of the capacitance can qualitatively give the charge generation capability, the variation regulation of the capacitance with the energy levels between the two organic semiconductors used means that the HOMO level of p-type organic molecules close to the LUMO of n-type organic molecules will generate more charge carriers in the CGL. Correspondingly, a high EL efficiency will then be obtained. As shown in Fig. 13(c), the maximum current efficiency and power efficiency does gradually increase from NaT2 to NaT6 by the energy level regulation, except for the case of NaT4.

The device structures are ITO/LiF(100 nm)/Alq3(30 nm)/LiF(0.3 nm)/C60(20 nm)/NaTn(10 nm)/MoO3(3 nm)/NPB(50 nm)/LiF(100 nm)/Al(120 nm). (b) The capacitance versus the difference between the HOMOs of NaTn and the LUMO of C60 at 15 V in the saturation regime. (c) The maximum power efficiency and current efficiency versus the difference between the HOMOs of NaTn and the LUMO of C60. (d) The characteristics of power efficiency and current efficiency versus the hole mobility of NaTn at the current density of 1 mA cm−2. 
Because the NaT4 possesses the highest hole mobility (0.39 cm2 V−1 s−1, Fig. 13(d)) with respect to the others,108 the achievement of the highest efficiency in tandem OLEDs with NaT4-based CGL indicates that the high mobility of the organic semiconductors used in OHJ CGLs is even more important. The high mobility will rapidly transport the generated charges towards the interfaces adjacent to the EL units under the electric field, thus facilitating the reduction of operational voltages. As shown in Fig. 13(d), the current efficiency and power efficiency of the fabricated tandem OLEDs based on NaTn/C60 OHJs as the CGL indeed increase with the hole mobility of NaTn from NaT2, NaT3, NaT5, NaT6, to NaT4. Therefore, the organic semiconductors used to construct high-performance OHJ CGLs not only need to have proper energy levels, i.e. closer levels between the HOMO of p-type organic semiconductor and the LUMO of n-type organic semiconductor, but also exhibit higher mobilities. Our results offer a design/selection rule for organic semiconductors used to construct effective OHJ CGLs, which is useful to fabricate high performance tandem OLEDs in the future.
4.4 Tandem white OLEDs (WOLEDs) based on OHJs as CGLs
WOLEDs have spurred much interest in recent years because of their merits in applications in next-generation full-color displays with color filters, backlights for liquid-crystal displays, and solid state lighting.109,110 Today's state-of-the-art tandem WOLEDs that vertically stack either individual red, green, and blue emission units or multiple white emission units in series via CGLs may be an effective approach to obtain white light since the efficiency and luminance can be doubled and better stability can be achieved.8,10,12,15,42–46 However, the tandem WOLEDs based on conventional CGLs cannot exhibit the enhancement of power efficiency with respect to the single-unit devices due to the high operational voltage. As demonstrated above, using OHJs as CGLs can enhance the power efficiency of the fabricated tandem OLEDs. Accordingly, we fabricated tandem WOELDs based on OHJs as CGLs, and found that the power efficiency of the tandem WOLEDs we made is indeed enhanced and the efficiency roll-off is greatly reduced compared to the conventional CGL-based tandem WOLEDs8,10,12,15,42–46Fig. 14 shows the device structures of the tandem WOLEDs based on conventional TPBi:Li2CO3/TCTA:MoO3 CGLs (Fig. 14(a)) and C60 (20 nm)/pentacene OHJ CGLs (Fig. 14(b)). The white emission is realized by stacking a green-red phosphorescence unit and a blue phosphorescence unit via a CGL.

It can be seen that the resulting tandem WOLEDs with a C60/pentacene OHJ CGL (tandem B) exhibit low operational voltage, high efficiency, and a less pronounced efficiency roll-off (also see Table 5). The power efficiency reaches 53 lm W−1 at a display-relevant luminance of 100 cd m−2 and 45 lm W−1 at an illumination-relevant luminance of 1000 cd m−2 without any out-coupling techniques. The current efficiency, external quantum efficiency, and power efficiency are slightly reduced to 101 cd A−1, 45.5%, 53 lm W−1 and 99.9 cd A−1, 45%, 45 lm W−1 at the luminance of 100 cd m−2 and 1000 cd m−2, respectively. The power efficiency roll-off values (maximum power efficiency, 53.8 lm W−1) are only 1.5% at a luminance of 100 cd m−2 and 16% at a luminance of 1000 cd m−2. If considering the potential of improved out-coupling for our tandem WOLEDs, the maximum power efficiency will be over 90 lm W−1, comparable to the general efficiency of fluorescent bulbs.109 Conversely, the highest efficiency roll-off was observed in TPBi:Li2CO3/TCTA:MoO3-based tandem WOLEDs (tandem A), where the power efficiency was decreased to 34 lm W−1 at a luminance of 1000 cd m−2 with a roll-off value of 24% (maximum power efficiency, 48.7 lm W−1).

As described above, the significant improvement in the power efficiency and efficiency roll-off of our tandem WOLEDs based on OHJ CGLs should be attributed to the effective charge generation, transport, and injection in the C60/pentacene OHJ. Fig. 15(a) shows the comparison of the C–V characteristics between capacitor devices based on C60/pentacene and TPBi:Li2CO3/TCTA:MoO3. It is clearly seen that the device based on C60/pentacene shows a higher capacitance and lower turn-on voltage for capacitance increase than that of the device based on TPBi:Li2CO3/TCTA:MoO3. This should indicate that the C60/pentacene OHJ generates more charges at a lower voltage. The large charge generation at low voltage will greatly increase the recombination ratio of electrons and holes in emissive units, thus enhancing the power efficiency and also improving the efficiency roll-off. Moreover, the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the two devices shown in Fig. 15(b) further prove this point. It can be seen that the C60/pentacene-based device shows higher current density than the TPBi:Li2CO3/TCTA:MoO3-based device in the whole range of voltages, demonstrating that the C60/pentacene OHJ indeed generates more charge carriers and possesses better charge transport characteristics due to its high electron and hole mobility.83,85

Nevertheless, the challenge posed in today's OHJ-based tandem WOLEDs is the fabrication of highly effective charge generation systems, that is, p-type and n-type organic semiconductors with matched energy levels and charge carrier mobility, which are always related to the operational voltage and the power efficiency. Fortunately, the years of advancements by us have shown that the bottleneck has gradually been overcome by reasonably controlling the energy levels of p-type and n-type organic semiconductors and by introducing a proper n-doped electron-transporting layer and a p-doped hole-transporting layer to enhance the electron and hole injection. Our results have fully shown the effectiveness of OHJs as CGLs in realizing high power efficiency tandem OLEDs.
5. Conclusions
Tandem OLEDs are one of the most effective structures for high-performance OLEDs. On the basis of OHJs, we have developed bilayer OHJ and bulk OHJ CGLs consisting of a p-type organic semiconductor and an n-type organic semiconductor and used them to fabricate tandem OLEDs with enhanced power efficiency. Not only can the luminance and current efficiency be improved by a factor of 2, but a significant enhancement can also be achieved in power efficiency due to the reduced operational voltage. To the best of our knowledge, we were the first report of a tandem OLED that achieves a twofold enhancement in power efficiency compared to a corresponding single-unit OLED. We also investigated the working mechanism of the OHJ CGLs. It is shown that the charge generation in the OHJs is due to the charge transfer from p-type organic semiconductor to n-type organic semiconductor, thus the holes are accumulated on the p-side and the electrons are accumulated on the n-side, forming the so-called accumulation junction. Our results have demonstrated that the effective charge transport and extraction/injection are very important in reducing the operational voltage. Due to the effectiveness of OHJs as CGLs in charge generation and transport, we successfully fabricated tandem WOLEDs based on OHJ CGLs. It is clearly seen that not only is the power efficiency greatly improved, but so too is the efficiency roll-off.
The investigations of the effects of the energy levels and mobility of the organic semiconductors used in OHJ CGLs on the performance of the fabricated tandem OLEDs have demonstrated the importance of high mobility and proper energy level positioning between two organic semiconductors. It is necessary that the p-type organic semiconductors should have a higher Fermi level than that of the n-type organic semiconductor, thus facilitating the formation of a highly conductive accumulation junction. Our previous results lead to a design/selection rule for organic semiconductors used to construct effective CGLs, which is useful in the design of high-performance tandem OLEDs in the future. However, an accurate theory of the operation in OHJ CGLs is still in its infancy. A quantitative and universal model is ardently anticipated, and once it is established, the methods for molecular scale and device structure manipulation for the prediction of device performance may become possible. Our current work gives a complete picture of reducing the operational voltage and improving the power efficiency in tandem OLEDs, which is helpful to the further optimization of the device structure. We thereby hope that this feature article will provide timely feedback for readers to pursue the rational design of high performance tandem OLEDs.
