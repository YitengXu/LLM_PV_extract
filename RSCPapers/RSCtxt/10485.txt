    , Accepted 24th November 2015First published on 1st December 2015AbstractPhotoinitiated interfacial electron transfer from organic semiconductors to inorganic ones is extremely important in organic/inorganic hybrid optoelectronic materials. Herein, we have prepared hybrid ZnO nanorods by grafting TDPP and TTDPP molecules through carboxyl acid groups. The steady-state spectroscopy results revealed that photoluminescence was subjected to severe quenching in the hybrid nanocomposites. Furthermore, time-resolved fluorescence and femtosecond transient absorption data verified the occurrence of the interface charge transfer between TDPP or TTDPP molecules and ZnO nanorods in the hybrid nanocomposites. The high performance UV-vis photodetector based on the TTDPP/ZnO hybrid have been fabricated with a photoresponsivity of 16.9 A W−1 and an on/off ratio as high as 104. The excellent visible-light photoresponse of the hybrid device can be attributed to the broadband absorption after the anchoring of the TTDPP compound on the surface of ZnO nanorods, the efficient cascade charge transfer process and the excellent capability of ZnO nanorods to provide direct and stable pathways for the transport of photogenerated electrons toward the collection electrode. This provides guidelines for the construction of organic/inorganic hybrids for optoelectronic applications.
Introduction
Hybrid organic/inorganic nanomaterials have been widely recognized as one of the most promising and rapidly emerging research areas, because they offer high electron mobility or improved spectral coverage for photoconductors, photoswitches and photovoltaic applications.1–10 In these devices, one photon absorbed by organic donor material produces a singlet exciton. The generated exciton subsequently diffuses until it reaches the donor–acceptor interface, where it may be dissociated into a pair of charges. That is, photoinduced charge transfer at the organic/inorganic semiconductor interface plays an important role in determining the performance of these hybrid devices.11–14 In real devices, the interfacial structures are sophisticated and several reactions take place simultaneously. Hence, the impact of each pathway and the corresponding role in device operation are difficult to distinguish. Inorganic semiconductors have greater electron affinities and higher dielectric constants than the organic materials, so charge transfer at the organic/inorganic interface occurs rapidly. ZnO nanorods are promising materials in organic/inorganic hybrid photoconductor and photovoltaic devices because of their environmentally friendly nature, low cost and high electron affinity.15–18 Recently, Yu et al.,19 reported an inverted device using poly thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the active layer and ZnO as the electron transport layer, with a maximum PCE reaching 8.32%. However, until now, the PCE of hybrid solar cells based on ZnO nanorods and poly-(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) was lower than 0.6%.15,20–23 Friend et al. have developed an “optical pump–push photocurrent probe” technique to study hybrid photovoltaic systems and observed that ∼50% photogenerated charges stayed in bound charge pair (BCP) states at the organic/inorganic interface and then recombined, whereas, interface modification with a fullerene derivative decreases the fraction of BCP to ∼25%, which substantially improved the device efficiency.24
1,4-Diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) compounds are emerging as starting materials for optoelectronic applications.25–32 They can be easily attached with various electron-rich units via a D–A covalent linkage strategy to adjust the HOMO/LUMO energy levels and obtain low bandgap organic semiconductors.33–36 For example, Janssen et al.,34 incorporating biphenyls as co-monomers in electron-deficient diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) conjugated polymers enabled widening of the optical band gap to 1.70 eV and increased the power conversion efficiencies to 3.7–5.7% in polymer solar cells. Ashraf et al.,37 designed a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole-based copolymers with different chalcogenophene co-monomers (thiophene, selenophene, and tellurophene) for use in field-effect transistors and organic photovoltaic devices, leading to an enhanced field-effect mobility of 1.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and improved solar cell efficiencies of 7.1–8.8%.
In order to investigate the possible interfacial electron transfer process from DPP derivatives with different HOMO/LUMO energy levels to ZnO and the role of cascade charge transfer in determining the photoresponse properties, we prepared hybrid nanorods by grafting DPP derivatives on the surface of ZnO nanorods using carboxylic acid end groups as functional ligands. Time-resolved fluorescence and femtosecond transient absorption data verified the occurrence of the interface charge transfer between TDPP or TTDPP molecules and ZnO nanorods in the hybrid nanocomposites. High performance UV-vis photodetectors based on the TTDPP/ZnO hybrid have been fabricated, which can be attributed to the broadband absorption after the anchoring of the TTDPP compound on the surface of ZnO nanorods and the efficient cascade charge transfer process.
Results and discussion
To visualize the electronic structure of TDPP and TTDPP, computational studies were performed by density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G level. The HOMO and LUMO of the TDPP molecule share similar electron densities, which are fully spread over the whole π-conjugated aromatic backbone (Fig. 1). In the case of the TTDPP molecule, an inhomogeneous electron density distribution is observed. Taking into account the electronic properties of thiophene (electron-rich) and DPP (electron-deficient), the generation of a strongly bound TTδ+–DPPδ− charge pair may be anticipated. The HOMO level of both TDPP and TTDPP locates at −2.58 eV, while the LUMO level of TDPP and TTDPP locates at −5.0 eV and −4.65 eV, respectively.

The as-prepared ZnO nanorods are single crystals with well-controlled sizes of 12 ± 4 nm in diameter and 100 ± 15 nm in length (Fig. 2a). The TEM images of TDPP/ZnO nanorods show that TDPP surface modification does not alter the nanorod morphology (Fig. 2b). HR-TEM analysis of the hybrid TDPP/ZnO and TTDPP/ZnO nanocomposites (Fig. 2c and d) indicates that the edges of the hybrid ZnO nanorods become blurred compared to that of the pure ZnO nanorods, verifying the grafting of organic compounds on the surface of ZnO nanorods.

Fig. 3a and b show the FT-IR spectra of organic compounds TDPP and TTDPP and the hybrid composites TDPP/ZnO and TTDPP/ZnO. Fig. 3a shows the FT-IR spectra of TDPP and TDPP/ZnO solids. The broad –OH stretching peak centered at 2900–3000 cm−1 and CO stretching vibration peaks at 1660 cm−1 and 1720 cm−1 of the TDPP solid are factually weak or absent in the spectrum of the TDPP/ZnO hybrid. On the other hand, the broad OCO stretching band at 1609 cm−1 in the spectrum of the TDPP/ZnO hybrid indicates the formation of carboxylate species with the O atom bonding to a single or two neighboring Zn atoms. Similar results were obtained for the TTDPP system (shown in Fig. 3b).

The steady-state spectroscopy measurements show that the absorption spectra are the superposition of features of individual component chromophores, i.e., TDPP, TTDPP and ZnO (Fig. 4a and c). The absorption peak at 365 nm in the UV-vis absorption spectra is ascribed to ZnO nanorods, while the absorption bands in the visible region are due to the organic components. Moreover, the maximum of absorption bands ascribed to the S0 → S1 electronic transition of TTDPP (620 nm) undergoes a bathochromic shift compared to that of TDPP (525 nm). Accordingly, the optical bandgaps of TDPP and TTDPP reduced from 2.22 eV to 2.00 eV. There is no evidence of any additional absorption peaks in the measured spectral range (250–800 nm), indicating no ground-state charge transfer in TDPP/ZnO and TTDPP/ZnO hybrid nanocomposites. Fig. 4b displays the fluorescence emission spectra of the compound TDPP and TDPP/ZnO in THF upon excitation at 480 nm. The TDPP compound shows a characteristic emission band at 550 nm. The fluorescence quantum yield is 0.78 ± 0.05. In the case of TTDPP, as shown in Fig. 4d, the maximum emission is red-shifted to 640 nm and the fluorescence quantum yield of TTDPP drops to 0.36 ± 0.02. From the above analysis, we can speculate the generation of a strongly bound TTδ+–DPPδ− charge pair in the TTDPP molecule. However, the fluorescence emission of TDPP/ZnO and TTDPP/ZnO hybrid composites is quenched almost completely, indicating the interface charge transfer between the organic compounds and ZnO nanorods.

The fluorescence spectra of (b) TDPP and TDPP/ZnO in THF and (d) TTDPP and TTDPP/ZnO in THF are also shown. 
The time-resolved fluorescence spectra of TDPP and TTDPP were recorded using a steak camera system. It was shown that the fluorescence time profile of TDPP can be fitted with single-exponential decay with a time constant of 5.45 ± 0.09 ns (Fig. 5a), consistent with the characteristic fluorescence lifetime of DPP derivatives without energy or electron transfer.38 The time-resolved fluorescence spectrum of TDPP/ZnO clarifies that fluorescence time profiles of TDPP can be well fitted with a bi-exponential function (Fig. 5a). The minor slow-decaying component of 3.57 ± 0.13 ns (7%) is assignable to residual components of TDPP chromophores. The lifetime of the short-lived component for TDPP/ZnO was 0.11 ± 0.005 ns (93%), which can be safely assigned to the electron transfer process from TDPP to ZnO nanorods. The time-resolved fluorescence spectrum of TTDPP upon excitation at 610 nm indicates that the emission kinetics is curve-fitted by a single-exponential function of 1.78 ± 0.03 ns (Fig. 5b). However, in the case of the TTDPP/ZnO hybrid composite (Fig. 5b), the fluorescence monitored at 640 nm is approximately curve-fitted by a biexponential function, with a minor slow decay of 1.68 ± 0.05 ns (22%) and a major short decay of 0.11 ± 0.01 ns. The major short lifetime can be safely ascribed to the electron transfer from TTDPP to ZnO nanorods. This photoinduced electron transfer mechanism has been already utilized for the construction of ferrocene–PBI linked ensembles in molecular fluorescence switch systems.39 These differences in the distinct fluorescence dynamics of the pristine TDPP, TTDPP and hybrids TDPP/ZnO and TTDPP/ZnO unambiguously remind us of the possibility that interfacial electron transfer takes place in hybrid TDPP/ZnO and TTDPP/ZnO systems, which is further supported by transient absorption spectroscopy (vide infra).

To have a deeper understanding of the photophysics and to further confirm the process of interface electron transfer, TTDPP and TTDPP/ZnO were investigated using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in THF solution. The transient absorption changes were recorded using 130 fs, 620 nm pulses. Fig. 6a depicts the transient absorption spectra of TTDPP in THF solution. An intense, broad positive signal covering 700–800 nm is observed. Moreover, the negative signal covering 570–700 nm contributes to the ground state bleaching and stimulated emission spectra. Analysis of the 730 nm kinetics results in a slow decay lifetime of 3.3 ns (Fig. 6c). The TTDPP/ZnO hybrid system shows the same spectral patterns as TTDPP (Fig. 6b). However, spectral dynamics is obviously shortened. Analysis of the 740 nm kinetics reveals two decay time constants of 2.2 ps and 2.2 ns (Fig. 6d). The fast component of 2.2 ps can be ascribed to the decay of the S1 state, whereas the slow process is due to the charge recombination of charge transfer (CT) state.

Time-profiles of the transient absorption at (c) 730 nm and (e) 610 nm for TTDPP and those at (d) 740 nm and (f) 630 nm for TTDPP/ZnO. The fit is also shown by the solid lines. 
We speculate that interfacial electron transfer resulted in a positive polaron on TTDPP and a negative polaron on ZnO nanorods. Unfortunately, the polaron state cannot be directly probed within our detecting wavelength range, possibly due to strong superposition with the overwhelming S1 and/or CT transition state. However, the existence of the polaron state can be verified by a long-lived ground-state bleaching signal (Fig. 6e and f). Kinetics analysis of 630 nm traces for the TTDPP/ZnO system exhibits a lifetime up to 4.0 ns (Fig. 6f), which is much longer than the 2.2 ns decay lifetime derived from the analysis of the 740 nm kinetics curve. A new transient species, namely the polaron state, produced via interfacial electron transfer between TTDPP and ZnO, is suggested to account for the long-lived ground state bleaching signal.
Consequently, the detailed photophysical processes in the TTDPP/ZnO system can be elucidated and shown in Scheme 1. After excitation, charge transfer from TT to DPP mostly occurred and the transient species TTδ+–DPPδ− was generated. The charge recombination depopulates the generated TTδ+–DPPδ− radical pair. The CT complex mostly underwent interfacial electron transfer from TTDPP to ZnO, promoting the final polaron state. It should be noted that the high dielectric constant of ZnO compared with organic compound promotes efficient decoupling of charge pairs due to the increased screening of the interactions between the positive and negative polarons, suppressing the geminate recombination process in the TTDPP/ZnO hybrid system.

We further characterized the photodetector performance of the hybrid nanocomposites. We carried out two-terminal measurements on bulk thin-film samples. Fig. 7a is the schematic diagram of the device configuration. The devices were fabricated by drop-casting 5 μL of ZnO (20 mg μL in CHCl3), TDPP/ZnO and TTDPP/ZnO in THF individually on the Si/SiO2 substrate (1 × 2 cm) prepatterned with gold electrodes and drying in air. The thickness of the film is about 150–200 nm estimated using a surface profilometer. The channel width and length are approximately 120 and 5 μm, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the device shows that the gap is filled with ZnO or hybrid ZnO nanorods, which form a continuous film connecting between Au electrodes (Fig. S1, ESI†). UV light is obtained from a xenon lamp through a band-pass filter (350–360 nm) and the corresponding spectrum is shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). Visible light is obtained from an iodine-tungsten lamp and the corresponding white-light spectrum is shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†) (450–750 nm), which is almost coincident with the absorption of the TTDPP compound.

ZnO is widely used as a visible-blind UV photodetector. The extremely high UV photoconductive is attributed to the presence of oxygen-related hole-trap states at the surface of ZnO, which prevents charge-carrier recombination and prolongs the photocarrier lifetime.40,41 As listed in Table 1 and Fig. 7b, the UV photo-responsivity (Rex) of the device, defined as photocurrent (Iph = Iillume − Idark) per unit of incident optical power, is 7.4 A W−1 under 11.60 mW cm−2 at an electric field of E = 8 V μm−1 for the pure ZnO nanorod film and the on/off ratio is 104. These values are close to that reported for pure ZnO UV photodetectors in the literature.1,41 Through chemical grafting of TDPP and TTDPP dyes on the surface of ZnO nanorods, the UV-responsivity slightly changes to 4.6 and 4.3 A W−1, respectively, while the on/off ratio to UV light has remains almost unchanged under the same conditions (Table 1). Thus, the anchoring of TDPP and TTDPP compounds on the surface of ZnO nanorods has negligible effects on the UV photodetection property of ZnO, which is attributed to the intrinsically high UV photosensitivity of ZnO.41,42

ZnO is a poor absorber in the visible region. It can be seen from Fig. 7c that the device of pristine ZnO shows almost no visible light photoresponse. Moreover, the device based on the TDPP/ZnO hybrid also shows a poor visible light photoresponse of 1.35 A W−1. In sharp contrast, the hybrid device based on TTDPP/ZnO exhibits an excellent visible-light photoresponse of 16.9 A W−1 (Table 1 and Fig. 7c). For the hybrid device based on TTDPP/ZnO, the dark current (Idark) was negligibly low (around 7.48 × 10−12 A). Upon visible-light illumination with a power density of 2.34 mW cm−2 at an electric field of E = 8 V μm−1, the photocurrent could reach to 5.41 × 10−7 A. The on/off switching ratios for TDPP/ZnO and TTDPP/ZnO devices were about 103 and 104, respectively. These are higher than most reported visible-light photodetectors based on ZnO.16,43,44 In addition, when the light density changed from 0.09 mW cm−2 to 2.34 mW cm−2, the photocurrent of hybrids TDPP/ZnO and TTDPP/ZnO within the voltage sweep interval increased accordingly (Fig. 8a), which could be attributed to the absorption of more photons by the photoconductor. In a general case, the photocurrent can be expressed as a power function of the light intensity: I ∼ PC2, where C2 corresponds to the photocapture coefficient and determines the response of photocurrent to light intensity.11,43,44 When C2 tends to 1, all recombination centers are empty, indicating monomolecular recombination in the bulk; when C2 equal to 0.5, it implies bimolecular recombination at the surface; when C2 tends to be a non-integer (>1), it suggests a complex charge carries recombination mechanism through traps or recombination centers in the bulk or on the crystal surface.45 It can be seen from Table 1 that the visible-light photocapture coefficient for the TTDPP/ZnO hybrid device is determined to be 1.3 ± 0.06, indicating an excellent photocapture in the device.46 The hybrid photodetector based on TTDPP/ZnO showed high stability at an electric field of 8 V μm−1 and under 2.34 mW cm−2 visible-light illumination (Fig. 8b).

The visible-light photoresponse of the TTDPP/ZnO hybrid system is much higher than that of TDPP/ZnO. Taking into account the electronic properties of thiophene (electron-rich) and DPP (electron-deficient), the generation of a strongly bound TTδ+–DPPδ− charge pair may be anticipated. The CT complex mostly undergoes interfacial electron transfer from TTDPP to ZnO, promoting the final polaron state or free carrier. Moreover, broad absorption of the TTDPP compound compared with TDPP and the excellent charge transportation property of ZnO nanorods all contribute to the high visible-light photoresponse of the hybrid TTDPP/ZnO nanocomposite.
Experimental
Steady-state spectral measurements
The UV-visible absorption spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 spectrometer with a scanning speed of 240 nm min−1 and a slit width of 1 nm. Fluorescence emission spectroscopy was performed on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The fluorescence quantum yield was determined in a dilute solution (A < 0.10) by the comparative method using Rhodamine 6G (FF = 0.95 in C2H5OH) and cresyl violet perchlorate (FF = 0.54 in C2H5OH) as standards. The solvents for the measurements were of chromatographic grade and were used as received.
Quantum chemical calculations
The theoretical calculations were performed using the DFT B3LYP/6-31G method and the GAUSSIAN-03 software package.51 The optimized configurations and frontier orbitals were generated using the GaussView software.
Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy
Fluorescence kinetics were measured using a picosecond time resolved fluorescence apparatus, which has been described in detail elsewhere.47 Briefly, the excitation laser pulses (620 nm) were supplied by an optical parametric amplifier (OPA-800CF, Spectra Physics), which was pumped by a regenerative amplifier (Spitfire, Spectra Physics). The excitation pulse energy was ∼100 nJ pulse−1 at a pulse repetition rate of 1 kHz, which was focused onto a spot 0.5 mm in diameter. The photoluminescence was collected with a 90 degree geometry, dispersed by a polychromator (250is, Chromex) and collected using a photon-counting type streak camera (C5680, Hamamatsu Photonics). The data detected by the digital camera (C4742-95, Hamamatsu) were routinely transferred to a PC for analysis using HPDTA software. The spectral resolution was 2 nm and the temporal resolution was 20–100 ps depending on the delay-time range setting. Analysis of the kinetic traces derived from the time-resolved spectra was performed individually using nonlinear least-square fitting to a general sum-of-exponentials function after deconvolution of the instrument response function (IRF). All the spectroscopic measurements were carried out at room temperature unless otherwise stated.
Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
A Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser system provided laser pulses for the femtosecond transient absorption measurements. A regenerative amplifier (Spitfire, Spectra Physics) seeded with a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (Tsunami, Spectra Physics) delivered laser pulses at 800 nm (130 fs, 1 kHz), which were then divided into two components using a 9:1 beam splitter. The major component was sent to an optical parametric amplifier (OPA-800CF, Spectra Physics) to generate the pump pulses (620 nm, 130 fs, 1 kHz). The minor component was further attenuated and focused into a 3 mm sapphire plate to generate the probe pulses. A band-pass filter (SPF-750, CVI) was inserted into the probe beam to a selected visible probe (680–790 nm) and a long-pass filter (HWB850, Nantong) for the near-infrared probe (840–1020 nm). The time delay between the pump and probe beams was regulated through a computer-controlled motorized translation stage in the probe beam. A magic-angle scheme was adopted in the pump–probe measurement. The temporal resolution between the pump and the probe pulses was determined to be B150 fs (FWHM). The transmitted light was detected by either a CMOS linear image sensor (S8377-512Q, Hamamatsu) or an InGaAs linear image sensor (G9203-256D, Hamamatsu) when necessary. The excitation pulsed energy was 0.2 mJ pulse−1 as measured at the rotating solution sample cell (optical path length: 1 mm) or a fixed solid sample holder. A typical absorbance of 0.4 at the excitation wavelength was used. The stability of the solutions was spectrophotometrically checked before and after each experiment.
Characterization of the morphology
The morphology of the nanobelts was imaged using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2011).
Photodetector device fabrication
The devices were fabricated by drop-casting 5 μL of ZnO (20 mg/μL in CHCl3), TDPP/ZnO and TTDPP/ZnO in THF individually on the Si/SiO2 substrate (1 × 2 cm) prepatterned with gold electrodes and drying in air. The thickness of the film is about 150–200 nm estimated using a surface profilometer. The channel width and length are approximately 120 and 5 μm, respectively. All the electrical characterizations were performed in air using a Keithley 4200 instrument under an ambient atmosphere.

Following chromatographic purification, the tert-butyl groups were removed in CH2Cl2/trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) mixed solvent.51 In a typical reaction, 0.03 g of the protected TDPP was dissolved in 10 mL of CH2Cl2 and TFA (V:V = 5:1) mixture solvent. The solution was stirred at room temperature for about 1 h. The progress of the reaction was followed by analytical TLC. Once the removal of all tert-butyl groups was clearly indicated by the TLC results, the solvents were removed under reduced pressure followed by drying in vacuo. Dye molecule 3 was obtained. 1H NMR for TDPP (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 10.04 (d, 2H), 7.94 (d, 2H), 7.88 (d, 2H), 7.60 (d, 2H), 4.21 (s, 4H). MALDI-TOF: 416.4. Analogous procedures were repeated for TTDPP. 1H NMR for TTDPP (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 10.02 (d, 2H), 8.01 (d, 4H), 7.61 (d, 4H), 7.02 (d, 4H), 6.95 (d, 4H), 4.22 (s, 4H), 2.88 (m, 4H), 1.92 (m, 4H), 1.69 (m, 4H), 1.26–1.38 (m, 6H). MALDI-TOF:748.9.

Preparation of ZnO nanorods
ZnO nanorods were prepared through treatment of a methanolic solution of zinc(II) diacetate with KOH as a base, following an experiment process similar to that reported in the literature.51,52 All materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
Fabrication of hybrid materials
2 mg of dry ZnO NRs was dissolved in 2 mL THF solutions of TDPP (2.79 × 10−5 M) and TTDPP (1.64 × 10−5 M) in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min for assembly of ZnO NRs. The mixtures were centrifuged and washed with THF three times. The solutions of TDPP/ZnO and TDPP/ZnO were obtained by re-dispersing the remains into 2 mL of THF. By taking an average surface per ZnO nanorod (10 × 100 nm) of 3140 nm2 and an average surface per TDPP and TTDPP molecule of 1.26 and 2.41 nm2 respectively, this corresponds to an average surface coverage of 45% and 51%, respectively.
Conclusions
In summary, two organic compounds TDPP and TTDPP were successfully grafted on the surface of n-type inorganic semiconductor ZnO nanorods using carboxylic acid end groups as functional ligands. Strong quenching of the fluorescence of TDPP and TTDPP moieties was observed after the grafting of TDPP and TTDPP on the surface of ZnO nanorods, suggesting an efficient interface charge transfer process from the TDPP or TTDPP chromophore to ZnO nanorods. The high performance visible-light photodetector based on TTDPP/ZnO has been fabricated with a high responsivity of 16.9 A W−1 and an on/off ratio as high as ∼104. The excellent visible-light photoresponse of the hybrid device can be attributed to the broadband absorption after the anchoring of the TTDPP compound on the surface of ZnO nanorods, the efficient cascade electron transfer process and the excellent capability of ZnO nanorods to provide direct and stable pathways for the transport of photogenerated electrons toward the collection electrode. The high visible-light response of the as-prepared hybrid device TTDPP/ZnO makes it a promising candidate for applications in photo-to-electrical energy conversion.
