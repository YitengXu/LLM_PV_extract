    , Accepted 7th January 2015First published on 19th January 2015AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) ultrathin nanocrystals represent a family of emerging nanomaterials with many proposed applications; however, the interlayer re-stacking between sheets greatly decreases the performance during practical operation. This work demonstrates a facile strategy to solve this challenging problem by rational assembly of 2D nanocrystals into three-dimensional (3D) aerogels, which paves the way for harvesting excellent structural properties of both nanostructures and macrostructures. The resultant 3D MnO2 aerogel shows significantly increased discharge capacity in Li–air batteries in comparison to its powder-like counterpart (4581.4 vs. 3902.6 mA h g−1), which outperforms many MnO2 and other transition metal-based electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, the as-fabricated Li–air cell demonstrates good rate capability and cycle life. Further mechanism study reveals that the improved performance is associated with ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets which allow highly exposed catalytic centres, as well as its excellent aerogel structure with rich porosity and a 3D continuous network that maximizes the utilization of MnO2 species for catalytic reactions. This study may open up new opportunities for making full use of 2D nanocrystals for a number of energy storage/conversion techniques.
Nowadays, two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin nanocrystals, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2),1,2 graphitic carbon nitrate (g-C3N4),3 nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4),4 and manganese dioxide (MnO2),5 have attracted an extensive amount of interest owing to their modified electronic, physical, and electrochemical properties as compared to their bulk counterparts. This new class of materials has been proposed to be used in a number of applications such as catalysis, sensors, absorbents and energy storage/conversion.1–5 However, owing to their high surface energy and van der Waals forces, 2D ultrathin nanocrystals tend to restack and condense which may compromise their performance during practical applications.1 To address this obstacle, many strategies have been put forward in the literature such as the addition of “spacers” between nanosheets6 and layer-by-layer assembly of 2D materials.5 Most research has been focused on maintaining the integrity of 2D architecture; however, these methods are complicated, and the performance remains unsatisfactory. Recently, there has been great interest in the study of assembling 2D nanocrystals into hierarchical microstructures, for example, integrating MoS2 nanosheets into hollow tubes1 and NiCo2O4 into nanoflowers.4 These studies provide new clues to inhibit the aggregation of 2D ultrathin nanosheets, and the as-resultant microstructures have been utilized for various applications with enhanced properties. Nevertheless, most reported microstructures are prepared in the form of powders, and the aggregation of these microstructures during post-synthesis processes is significant (such as dry in the oven), resulting in a reduced accessible surface area and porosity. As a result, it remains a great challenge to prohibit the restacking of 2D nanocrystals for achieving optimal electrochemical and/or catalytic properties.
On the other hand, Li–O2 batteries have received much attention in recent years owing to their higher energy densities than common Li-ions batteries (11680 vs. ∼300 W h kg−1), which make them appealing candidates for applications such as portable electronics, vehicle transportation, and smart grids.7,8 The heart of a Li–O2 battery is the cathode (also named as the air electrode), in which the reversible formation and decomposition of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) play a key role in the discharge and charge processes.12,19 To facilitate the kinetics of the ORR/OER, various electrocatalysts have been developed including carbon-based materials, transition metal oxides, noble metals, etc.9–11 Among them, transition metal oxides in particular manganese dioxide (MnO2) have been widely investigated because of their high intrinsic activity, low cost, abundance, and environmental friendliness.11,12 However, bulk MnO2 only delivers moderate catalytic performance because of the lack of open channels for lithium ions and oxygen gas access and transport. The reduction in the particle thickness to the atomic level to generate 2D MnO2 ultrathin nanosheets can significantly increase the accessible surface area, cut ion migration path length, and facilitate reaction kinetics. Nevertheless, 2D MnO2 nanosheets might tend to aggregate with each other during the operation process, which greatly decrease the discharge capacity of Li–O2 batteries.
Three-dimensional (3D) macroscopic assemblies, such as aerogels and hydrogels, represent a category of materials that features low densities, large open pores, high inner surface areas, and superior physical and chemical properties.13–15 Therefore, the assembly of 2D nanocrystals into 3D aerogels/hydrogels might provide a new solution to the challenging problems of nanosheet aggregation. Indeed, our previous studies have provided some insight into this hypothesis. We have prepared a number of 3D aerogel/hydrogel catalyst electrodes on the basis of 2D graphene sheets and other nanoparticles (NiCo2O4,14 carbon nanotubes,15etc.), which exhibited significantly enhanced OER catalytic properties as compared to their powder-like counterparts. Since the OER is a reverse process of the ORR, and both of them are critical processes of Li–O2 batteries; it is expected that the assembly of 2D nanocrystals into 3D aerogels will lead to an improved performance in Li–O2 batteries. To the best of our knowledge, the reports of 3D MnO2 ultrathin nanosheet aerogels for Li–O2 batteries are rare.
Herein, we report the work of bottom-up assembly of 2D MnO2 nanosheets into 3D aerogels (denoted as 3D MnO2). The as-resultant material can combine a number of excellent structural properties such as highly exposed active sites, rich porosity, and 3D continuous network, making it a promising catalyst for many electrochemical applications. Li–O2 cells with 3D MnO2 as a cathodic catalyst show significantly increased discharge capacity, which outperforms those of many MnO2 and other transition metal-based electrocatalysts.
3D MnO2 was synthesized according to the procedure shown in Scheme 1. In the first step, MnO2 ultrathin nanosheets were assembled into nanoflowers by a chemical reaction of manganese precursors in a water–dimethylformamide (DMF) mixed solution (step A). Subsequently, the as-produced material was dispersed in water, frozen by liquid nitrogen (step B), and thawed in a freeze drier (step C).

The optical image in Fig. 1A reveals that 3D MnO2 has a self-supported macroscopic cylinder structure around 0.8 cm in diameter and several centimetres in length. The material has a well-developed 3D continuous network with the pore size ranging from several to tens of micrometers (Fig. 1B). Techniques such as element mapping (Fig. 1C), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Fig. 1D and E) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Fig. S1†) confirm the flower-like morphology of MnO2 around 200 nm size constructed with intersected ultrathin nanosheets. The ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets tend to curl and fold, thus providing an opportunity to directly measure their thickness from the vertical edges. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, Fig. 1F) reveals that the typical thickness of nanosheets is around 3.6 nm, corresponding to 3–4 layered MnO2 crystal unit cells.5

The XRD pattern (Fig. 2A) of 3D MnO2 reveals four prominent peaks that match well with δ-MnO2 (JPCDS card no. 80-1098). As compared to its powder-like counterpart prepared without freeze-drying (see Experimental section), the 3D MnO2 aerogel shows a significantly weakened diffraction peaks, indicating that single MnO2 nanosheets in the 3D structure are largely separated. Moreover, the nitrogen adsorption isotherm shown in Fig. 2B resembles type IV with a narrow hysteresis loop. The corresponding pore size distribution obtained by the BJH method shows the presence of both mesopores and small macropores ranging from 15 to 60 nm (inset in Fig. 2B).16 The Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area of 3D MnO2 is as high as 156 m2 g−1, and its pore volume is 0.56 cm3 g−1. The relatively high surface area with rich porosity may provide a more accessible surface for catalytic processes.

The chemical structure of 3D MnO2 was detected using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. 2C); the peaks of Mn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 are centred at 657.1 and 654.3 eV, respectively, with a spin energy separation of 11.8 eV in agreement with the reported data of Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 in MnO2. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) further verifies the formation of MnO2 material, where only Mn, O, C, and Pt can be observed (C emanates from carbon coated SEM tap, and Pt from Pt coatings, Fig. 2D). The Raman spectrum of MnO2 is characterized by two sharp peaks at 457 and 635 cm−1 along with four weak bands at 216, 354, 554 and 753 cm−1 (Fig. 2E). The main contribution to these peaks is the stretching mode of MnO6 octahedra in MnO2.17 Moreover, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. 2F) plot of 3D MnO2 indicates a continuous weight loss from 120 to 500 °C originating from the removal of physisorbed water (∼120 °C), structural water (∼200 °C) and phase transition from MnO2 to Mn2O3 (∼500 °C).
The formation mechanisms of 3D MnO2 are studied on the basis of a series of controlled experiments. There are two steps in the preparation processes, i.e., assembly of MnO2 ultrathin nanosheets into nanoflowers and subsequent freeze-drying into 3D aerogels. In the first step, time-dependent experiments from 1 to 30 min are conducted to examine the intermediate crystal growth products of MnO2 nanoflowers. The analyses of zeta-potential (Fig. 3A), TEM (Fig. S2†), and UV-vis spectra (Fig. S3†) suggest that the dissolution–crystallization mechanism is responsible for this process where less ordered MnO2 precursors gradually disappear with the emergence of more nanoflowers.6 Of particular interest is that DMF plays a key role in the formation of MnO2 nanoflowers. The FT-IR spectrum of MnO2 shows –CH3 stretching vibrations at 2800–3000 cm−1 and CO modes at 1700 cm−1 (Fig. 3B), which indicate that the surface of MnO2 is capped with DMF (chemical structure: ((CH3)2NC(O)H). Moreover, a high DMF–water ratio (from 0/55 to 10/45, 20/35 and 40/15) is beneficial to the formation of MnO2 nanoflowers (Fig. S4†), thus indicating that DMF serves both as a solvent and a surface ligand during crystal growth.1

In the second step, MnO2 nanoflowers are frozen in a liquid nitrogen bath. In this process, phase separation between water and ice can result in the rejection of solid nanoparticles, where MnO2 is entrapped between neighboring ice crystals (Scheme 1).18 Because the growth rate of ice crystals is highly anisotropic, MnO2 nanoflowers are forced to align and concentrate along the moving solidification front to form a continuous 3D network. Subsequent sublimation of ice leads to the formation of MnO2 aerogels. The interactions between MnO2 nanoflowers in 3D architecture is proposed as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding as indicated by the presence of C–O and –OH groups in MnO2 dispersion (Fig. 3B).
The as-prepared 3D MnO2 aerogel was mixed with Ketjenblack carbon and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in a molar ratio of 30:60:10, and fabricated into catalyst electrodes for Li–O2 batteries. For comparison, its counterpart without 3D architecture (i.e. “powder MnO2”) was also evaluated under similar conditions. The Li–O2 cells exhibited a discharge voltage around 2.85 V vs. Li+/Li0, which is higher than that of the powder MnO2 by 60–80 mV, corresponding to the transition from Li+ into Li2O2via the ORR process (Fig. 4A).13,22 The charge voltage of the Li–O2 cells with 3D MnO2 was much lower than that of the powder MnO2 by around 130 mV, corresponding to the transition from Li2O2 into Li+via the OER process. Note that 3D MnO2 aerogels are more effective for catalyzing the OER and ORR as compared to powder MnO2, indicating that the unique aerogel structure plays an important role during discharge and charge processes of Li–O2 batteries. To the best of our knowledge, the discharge capacity of 3D MnO2 (4581 mA h g−1) outperforms those of many transition metal-based electrocatalysts reported in the literature (Table S1†), such as Fe2O3 (2700 mA h g−1),19 α-MnO2 nanowires (3000 mA h g−1),11 and MnO2–carbon nanotube composite (2247 mA h g−1).20

Besides discharge capacity, Li–O2 cells with 3D MnO2 also shows good rate capability (Fig. 4B). The initial discharge capacity is 4581 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1. The discharge capacities only gradually decrease at higher current densities, which are 2727 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, 2343 mA h g−1 at 200 mA g−1, and 1519 mA h g−1 at 300 mA g−1. This phenomenon might be explained by the rich porosity and 3D continuous network of the 3D MnO2 aerogel, which can increase the utilization of active species at high current densities, and provide more access to the capacities. Further, cycling performances of the Li–O2 cell with 3D MnO2 are shown in Fig. 4C and D. The Li–O2 cells with 3D MnO2 was cycled at a 1000 mA h g−1 capacity limit for 25 cycles with stable discharge–charge voltage platforms, demonstrating good electrode stability.7,21,22
The observed performance enhancement in 3D MnO2 indicates that the proposed electrocatalyst is favourable for energy storage in Li–O2 batteries. First, the ultrathin nanosheets in 3D MnO2 afford highly accessible catalytic centres to facilitate the ORR/OER processes.1,2 The reduction in the particle thickness has led to a much higher discharge capacity in 3D MnO2 than its powder counterpart (4581.4 vs. 3902.6 mA h g−1, Fig. 4A). On the other hand, the formation of 3D macroscopic aerogels by the freeze-drying method can effectively inhibit the restacking in MnO2 ultrathin nanosheets, thus enabling the maximal use of active centres for catalytic reactions. The formation of well-defined macro/mesoporosity is confirmed by both nitrogen adsorption and XRD analysis (Fig. 2A and B). These porous structures can reduce the migration path length of both oxygen molecules and lithium ions,23,24 thereby significantly enhancing the rate capability in Li–O2 cells. Further, the excellent stability can be explained by the rich 3D hierarchical porous structure that can accommodate the as-formed Li2O2 during the discharging–charging process.11
The recent research studies of Li–O2 batteries mainly focus on mechanism studies of electrochemical process and Li storage and transport.7,25 On the other hand, electrode materials are also critical components of Li–O2 batteries which are directly associated with the efficiency, kinetics and stability of batteries.26,27 The aim of this work is to design new architectured cathodes for Li–O2 batteries. We have introduced an emerging category of nano-materials as cathodes, i.e., 2D ultrathin nanocrystals, which can provide enormous active centres for enhanced ORR and OER catalytic activities during discharging and charging processes. In view of their tendency to aggregate, 2D ultrathin nanocrystals have been assembled into 3D aerogels for practical applications. To the best of our knowledge, despite a few previous reports regarding MnO2 nanoflowers,28,29 the study of 3D MnO2 ultrathin nanosheet aerogels for Li–O2 batteries has been scarcely reported.
In conclusion, this work reports the first bottom-up synthesis of MnO2 ultrathin nanosheet aerogels for Li–O2 batteries. The new material is greatly favorable for ORR/OER, and shows a higher discharge capacity than its counterparts without 3D architecture. Meanwhile, the Li–O2 cell with 3D MnO2 demonstrates good rate capability and cycling performance. Further study reveals that the dissolution–crystallization and ice-assisted freeze-drying processes play a critical role in the rational assembly of 2D nanosheets. The catalyst is synthesized through a facile solution strategy, which can be easily extended to the preparation of many other nanomaterials for a broad range of applications in catalysis, solar cells and energy conversion.
