    , Accepted 30th October 2012First published on 31st October 2012AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells using nanocrystalline ZnO as the photoanode and a metal-free sensitizer with a benzothiadiazole entity directly connected to the 2-cyanoacrylic acid acceptor exhibited an efficiency (5.18%) higher than those using the TiO2 photoanode. Use of a hierarchical ZnO back scattering layer further improved the efficiency to 5.82%.
ZnO is attractive as the photoanode of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) because of its wide band gap (3.37 eV) characteristic and comparable conduction band energy with TiO2.1a,b Compared to TiO2, ZnO has even higher electron mobility and electron-lifetime.1c,d Many studies on ZnO were focused on modified nanostructures such as nanoparticles,2 nanosheets,3 nanowires,4 and nanoflowers.5 DSSCs using the ZnO photoanode exhibit improved efficiencies through optimization of the pore surface, treatment temperature, synthetic procedure or amalgamating different materials (TiO2 and Sn).1c,d,6
ZnO was found to be incompatible with some Ru dyes because of two factors: (1) ZnO is more basic than TiO2 and is vulnerable under lower pH conditions; (2) Ru dyes contain complexing agents capable of removing Zn2+ ions from the ZnO lattice.7 Therefore, higher dye uptake by increasing the immersion time of ZnO in dye solution is problematic. In comparison, ZnO seems to be more robust towards metal-free dyes, and there have been several successful examples. In 2010, Cheng and Hsieh developed self-assembled hierarchical ZnO secondary nanoparticles which provided high light scattering and harvesting. Under AM 1.5 one sun condition, efficiencies of 5.34% and 4.95% were achieved for indoline dyes, D205 and D149, respectively.8a A conversion efficiency of 1.23% was reported by Funabiki et al. by using a near-infrared absorbing heptamethine–cyanine dye (KFH-3) and porous ZnO photoanode prepared at low temperature.8b A cell efficiency of 2.53% was demonstrated by Bendall et al. using a metal-free dye (C220) and core–shell nanowires of ZnO/TiO2.4b
The benzothiadiazole (BT) unit is used as the building block of low-band gap polymers for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells.9 We also found that incorporation of a BT unit in the conjugated space of metal-free sensitizers effectively red shifted the absorption spectra of the dyes.10 DSSCs based on several BT-based metal-free sensitizers have been reported to have good performance since then.11 Although incorporation of the BT entity in the spacer results in a red shift of the absorption, partial charge-trapping at the BT entity may hamper electron injection from the dye to the TiO2 conduction band and counteracts the performance of the DSSCs.11e By tethering two electron-donating alkoxy chains at the BT entity, the cell efficiency reached ∼92% of the N719-based standard DSSC.11g However, charge trapping was not eased. We therefore decided to synthesize BT-containing sensitizers with the BT entity directly connected to 2-cyanoacrylic acid (also as the anchoring group) for DSSCs using ZnO as the photoanode based on the following reasons: (1) the charge accumulated at the BT entity may have better opportunity to inject into ZnO due to a shorter distance between BT and the anchoring group; (2) the electrons injected into ZnO may be quickly transported to avoid charge recombination. In this communication, new BT-based sensitizers comprising an arylamine donor, a conjugated spacer containing a BT entity, and 2-cyanoacrylic acid acceptor are reported. DSSCs using these sensitizers and the ZnO photoanode will be also discussed.
New dyes, RL1 to RL3, are shown in Fig. 1, and the synthetic details are described in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The absorption spectra of the dyes (in THF) have two bands in the range of 330–540 nm (Fig. 2). The band below 400 nm is due to the π–π* transition of the conjugated molecules, and that in the longer wavelength region (480–540 nm) is ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer transition with π–π* transition character. The λabs values are in the order of RL3 (540 nm) > RL2 (513 nm) > RL1 (486 nm). Incorporation of two alkoxy substituents increases the electron donating power of the triarylamine, consequently, RL2 displays a red-shift of the absorption compared to RL1. Insertion of a thiophene ring between BT and the arylamine of RL2 increases the conjugation length and further red shifts the absorption spectrum: RL2, 513 nm; RL3, 540 nm. Similarly, insertion of a thiophene ring between BT and the 2-cyanovinyl entity leads to a red shift of the absorption: RL1, 486 nm; S1, 492 nm (Fig. 2). A blue shift of the absorption spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†) is noticed when the dyes are adsorbed on ZnO; this is attributed to the weaker electron-withdrawing power of the carboxylate than the carboxylic acid.12

 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of the dyes in THF. 
Cyclic voltammograms for the compounds are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) and the relevant electrochemical data are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). The reversible wave due to the oxidation of arylamine decreases in the order of RL1 > RL2 > RL3. Apparently, the presence of electron-donating alkoxy substituents in RL2 and RL3 significantly increases the electron density of arylamine. The lower oxidation potential of RL3 than RL2 is attributable to the nearby electron excessive thiophene in the former. Being closer to the electron deficient BT entity, the arylamine in RL1 is expected to have a lower electron density and is more difficult to be oxidized. More negative excited state oxidation potential of the RL dyes than the conduction-band-edge of ZnO (−0.41 V vs. NHE) ensures electron injection into the conduction band of ZnO.
The performance data of DSSCs based on ZnO photoanodes (film with a thickness of 15 μm from the nanoparticles of 20 nm in diameter) under AM 1.5 illumination are collected in Table 1. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of the cells are plotted in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. All the devices exhibited good power conversion efficiencies ranging from 4.02 to 5.18%. It is noteworthy that the efficiency of RL1 on ZnO photoanodes is higher than that of RL1 by 0.75% fabricated on TiO2 and measured under similar conditions even though the adsorbed dye density of the former is slightly lower (Table 1). This witnesses the potential of using ZnO as an alternate photoanode for TiO2. The adsorbed dye density (Table 1) of the sensitizer with two hexyloxy substituents (RL2 or RL3) is >30% smaller than that of RL1, indicating that the two flexible long chains impede more compact packing of the dye molecules on the ZnO surface. DSSC based on RL1 has only a slightly higher conversion efficiency than S1-based cells despite the higher dye density of RL1 than S1 by ∼1.3 times. This can be rationalized by the following reasons: (1) S1 has a significantly higher absorption intensity compared to RL1; (2) the cell of S1 has lower dark current than that of RL1. In contrast, the cell of RL1 exhibits a smaller charge transport resistance, that is, more efficient electron transport (vide infra, see EIS discussions). RL2 (or RL3) has a lower efficiency than RL1, possibly because of the lower dye density which results in larger dark current (vide infra) and therefore lower VOC values. Slower regeneration of the oxidized dye by the electrolyte due to the higher HOMO level of RL2 (or RL3) than RL1 leading to less efficient electron injection cannot be excluded, however.

The dark current density and the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of DSSCs in the dark are shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S3a (ESI†), respectively. The intermediate frequency semicircle in the Nyquist plot represents the charge transfer phenomena between the TiO2 surface and the electrolyte, i.e., dark current. The resistance towards the dark current (the size of semicircle) decreases in the order of S1 > RL1 > RL2 > RL3, which is consistent with the dark current (Fig. 3a) and the VOC values (Table 1). Electrochemical impedance upon illumination of 100 mW cm−2 was also measured under open-circuit conditions, and the Nyquist plots of DSSCs with different dyes are shown in Fig. S3b (ESI†). The radius of the intermediate frequency semicircle (10−2 to 105 Hz) in the Nyquist plot reflects the electron transport resistance, and the smaller radius means the lower electron transport resistance. The electron transport resistance decreases in the order of RL3 > S1 > RL2 > RL1. We suspect that the larger dipole (Table S2, ESI†) in RL3 and RL2 results in up-shift of the Fermi level of ZnO and decreases the electron injection efficiency. Quantum chemistry computation results (Tables S2 and S3, Fig. S4–S7, ESI†) support the charge transfer character of the S0 → S1 transition. The product of the oscillator strength and the Mulliken charge changes (Fig. S7, ESI†) in the 2-cyanoacryc acid group is slightly higher in the RL dyes (RL1 −0.09: RL2: −0.10; RL3: −0.11) than S1 (−0.07), suggesting that electron injection is slightly favoured for the RL dyes. The stabilities of the morphology of N3-, RL- and D149-adsorbed ZnO were also examined briefly by SEM (Fig. S8, ESI†). There was no noticeable change of morphology for RL-adsorbed ZnO after 24 h. In comparison, morphology degradation of N3-adsorbed ZnO was very evident.
The cell with the best performance dye, RL1, was subjected to further device modification. ZnO-based DSSCs with an additional ZnO scattering layer (SL) such as sub-micro sized hexagonal ZnO club13 and a double light-scattering-layer ZnO film consisting of ZnO monodisperse aggregates as an underlayer and sub-micrometer-sized platelike ZnO (SP-ZnO) as an overlayer14 were reported to have improved performance over the pristine ZnO-based cells. Therefore, newly developed brush hierarchical ZnO nanoplates were used as the SL (3.5 μm). The SEM micrographs of brush hierarchical ZnO at different magnifications are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). A very homogeneous and dense structure can be clearly seen in Fig. S9a and S9b (ESI†). A secondary structure is evident from the zoom-in graph (Fig. S9c, ESI†) and is composed of dense 1-D nanowires, with an average diameter of 15 nm and length of 1.3 μm, protruding from both sides of nanosheets which have an average width of 250 nm and length of 1.5 μm. All of the peaks in the XRD spectra (Fig. S9d, ESI†) were well indexed to hexagonal wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS No. 79-0206, a = 0.3248 nm, c = 0.5206 nm) with high crystallinity. No characteristic peaks for impurities such as Zn and Zn(OH)2 were observed.
The J–V curves of the cells with and without the SL are shown in Fig. S10a (ESI†), and the performance parameters are collected in Table 2. Compared to the cell without the SL, the JSC value and the conversion efficiency of the cell with SL increase by 1.20 mA cm−2 and 0.64%, respectively. A significant increment of external quantum efficiency in the range of 400 to 550 nm is evident from the IPCE spectra (Fig. S10b, ESI†). Obviously the hierarchical layer efficiently scatters the light back to the active ZnO layer and increases the light path in the active layer. The device of ZnO with the SL has an efficiency ∼0.6% higher than the device of TiO2 using nanoparticles of 20 nm in diameter (15 μm in thickness) as the active layer and nanoparticles of 400 nm (4 μm in thickness) as the SL. To our knowledge, there is no report on DSSCs using hierarchical branching ZnO nanomaterials as the SL. In this communication, we also report DSSCs based on a new dye using ZnO nanoparticles as the active layer and hierarchical branching ZnO nanomaterials as the SL.

In summary, DSSCs using benzothiadiazole-based dyes and a ZnO photoanode exhibited high conversion efficiencies (4.02% to 5.18%). The cell efficiency can be further improved to 5.82% when a novel hierarchical ZnO was used as the light back scattering layer of the cell.
