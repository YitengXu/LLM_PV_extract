    AbstractA new C60-end capped poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT-C60) was synthesized via a simple three-step process, and used as a compatibilizer for P3HT/PCBM composite for the purpose of controlling the morphology of P3HT/PCBM composite film, and thus improving the long-term thermal stability of solar cell performance. When a small amount of P3HT-C60 was added to P3HT/PCBM, the bicontinuous and nanometre-scale film morphology was developed and preserved for 2 h of annealing at 150 °C. Furthermore, the addition of P3HT-C60 as a compatibilizer suppressed large-scale phase separation of P3HT/PCBM composite even after prolonged annealing time (8 days), and as a result, the P3HT/PCBM/P3HT-C60 bulk heterojunction solar cells exhibited the excellent long-term thermal stability of device performance.
Introduction
For efficient bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, the three-dimensional bicontinuous and nanometre-scale morphology of the active layer is of the utmost importance, because efficient photo-induced charge generation, transport and collection at each electrode crucially depend on the morphology of the composite films.1,2 Over the last decade, many research groups have systematically analyzed external parameters such as the relative concentration of the donor and acceptor, the choice of spin-coating solvent,3,4 thermal annealing,5,6 and solvent annealing procedures7,8 in order to optimize the BHJ morphology of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) composite films for high-efficiency solar cells. However, controlling the donor/acceptor composite morphology and optimizing the device performance are extremely difficult since the nanometre-scale morphology of the active layer is not thermodynamically stable and therefore obtained by kinetically controlling the non-equilibrium state. Furthermore, exposure to sunlight for long periods will cause macrophase separation of donor/acceptor blend with micrometre-scale, which is much larger than the exciton diffusion length in conjugated polymers.9 It has been reported that a prolonged thermal annealing induces the formation of large aggregation of PCBM, which deteriorates the device performance.10,11
One approach towards controlling the nanometre-scale morphology and improving the long-term thermal stability of conjugated polymer-fullerene BHJ solar cells is to use diblock copolymers, which have two different blocks of conjugated polymers and fullerene, as a compatibilizer.12–14 Addition of the diblock copolymer compatibilizers can lower the interfacial tension between the P3HT and PCBM phases, and suppress coalescence, due to the preferential location of the diblock copolymer at the interface between two phases, resulting in reduction of phase sizes of the P3HT/PCBM composite and improving the long-term thermal stability. However, the synthesis of diblock copolymer compatibilizer having P3HT and fullerene blocks is burdensome because of multiple post-polymerization steps and low solubility of fullerenes.15 Furthermore, the presence of a substantial amount of insulating moieties required for introducing C60 in the second block can deteriorate the charge carrier transport in the BHJ devices.13
To overcome these limitations of diblock copolymer, we report here the simple synthesis of a C60-end capped P3HT as a compatibilizer for P3HT/PCBM composite (Scheme 1). Very recently, Hillmyer and his co-workers16 synthesized a difunctional, fullerene-terminated P3HT (C60-P3HT-C60), and reported its optical properties and microstructures. However, they used the C60-P3HT-C60 as an internal electron accepting-donating-accepting material, not as a compatibilizer. Furthermore, they did not provide any data for photovoltaic performances.

In order to minimize the amount of insulating moieties, the C60-end capped P3HT (P3HT-C60) was synthesized via controlled polymerization followed by directly linking a fullerene derivative at the end of the regioregular P3HT chain. The chemical structure of P3HT-C60 was identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). We examined the effect of P3HT-C60 compatibilizer on the morphology of P3HT/PCBM composite and investigated the relation between the morphology change and the long-term stability of solar cell performance.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of P3HT-C60
A new P3HT-C60 compatibilizer was synthesized through the use of controlled Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization method and subsequent post-polymerization functionalization (Scheme 1). Hydroxypropyl-terminated P3HT (P3HT-OH) was synthesized according to the procedure reported in the literature.17 Synthesis of regioregular polythiophenes and subsequent end-group functionalization of these polymers have been developed by McCullough and his co-workers,18,19 and many other research groups have used the method to synthesize various kinds of polythiophene derivatives and polythiophene diblock copolymers.20–24 In this study, end-functionalized P3HT with relatively low molecular weight (Mn = 6000, Mw/Mn = 1.12 by GPC) was synthesized, because lower molecular weight polymer could be more effective to locate at the interface between P3HT and PCBM phases and thus to act as a compatibilizer.
As shown in Scheme 1, carboxylate-functionalized fullerene, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA), was linked covalently to the end of the P3HT-OH to yield the final product, P3HT-C60. At first, we used thionyl chloride to convert the carboxylic acid of the PCBA to acyl chloride. Although the esterification of the hydroxyl of P3HT-OH with the acyl chloride of the functionalized fullerene was successful, photovoltaic properties of the obtained product were not satisfactory. Since the thionyl chloride is a strong oxidizing agent for carbon materials,25 it is expected that PCBA undergoes p-type doping when treated with thionyl chloride, and as a result the obtained product is easily oxidized. To avoid this problem, we employed Steglich (DCC/DMAP) esterification of the hydroxyl of P3HT-OH with the carboxylic acid of PCBA. The Steglich esterification is one of the most convenient methods for the formation of ester bond since the reaction condition is mild but the conversion is very high due to the favourable catalytic action of DMAP.26 Consequently, P3HT-OH was successfully converted to the desired product, P3HT-C60, which was very stable in air.
The esterification of P3HT-OH with PCBA was identified by 1H NMR and FTIR. When the 1H NMR spectrum of P3HT-C60 in CDCl3 is compared with that of P3HT-OH (Fig. 1), methylene proton signal adjacent to hydroxyl group of P3HT-OH is down-field shifted from 3.75 to 4.2 ppm after esterification with PCBA, confirming that the hydroxyl group of P3HT-OH is esterified.

FT-IR spectra of the P3HT-OH and P3HT-C60 are compared in Fig. 2. The characteristic bands of P3HT-OH are observed at 3100–3600 cm−1 (OH stretch), 2950–2850 cm−1 (aliphatic C–H stretch), 1510–1450 cm−1 (ring stretch), 1375 cm−1 (methyl deformation), 1100 cm−1 (C–O stretch), and 820 cm−1 (aromatic C–H out-of-plain vibrations), while the FT-IR spectrum of P3HT-C60 shows the complete disappearance of OH stretching vibration and the appearance of CO stretching vibration at 1735 cm−1. The appearance of sharp peak at 528 cm−1, which is characteristic for fullerene, also confirms that PCBA is linked covalently to the end of the P3HT chain.

Fig. 3 shows the GPC traces of P3HT-OH and P3HT-C60. Both samples show a unimodal, symmetric peak with narrow molecular weight distribution (Mn = 6000, Mw/Mn = 1.12 for P3HT-OH and Mn = 6300, 1.18 for P3HT-C60 by GPC). For exact determination of molecular weight, we performed a MALDI-TOF MS experiment, which reveals that the number average molecular weights of P3HT-OH and P3HT-C60 are 4305 and 5160 g mol−1, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4. The molecular weight difference (855 g mol−1) between P3HT-OH and P3HT-C60 clearly indicates the attachment of C60 to the P3HT chains.

TGA was used to quantify the exact content of C60 in P3HT-C60. Fig. 5 shows the TGA thermograms of PCBA, P3HT-OH, and P3HT-C60, where PCBA shows minor decomposition at around 200 and 370 °C, due to the loss of a short alkyl chain and a benzene ring attached to C60, leaving a C60 adduct which results in the char yield of 82% at 800 °C. Since the char yields of P3HT-C60 and P3HT-OH are 37% and 29%, respectively, the weight fraction of C60 in P3HT-C60 is estimated to be 0.13, indicating that most of P3HT-OH (≥90%) was functionalized by fullerene derivative.
 Fig. 5  TGA curves of PCBA, P3HT-C60, and P3HT-OH. 
To investigate the effect of the attachment of C60 on the crystallization of P3HT, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used. As can be seen in Fig. 6, both melting (Tm) and crystallization (Tc) temperatures of P3HT are decreased as the fullerene is linked to the end of P3HT chain. This is because the bulky end group of the polymer chain acts as an impurity in P3HT crystallite that reduces the size of P3HT crystallite or changes molecular interaction.27 The crystallinity (Xc) of P3HT-OH and P3HT-C60 can be calculated by integrating the area under the melting peak, normalizing the values by the amount of P3HT present in the sample, and comparing this with the literature value for the enthalpy of melting of the theoretical 100% crystal, ΔHm,P3HT = 99 J g−1.28 The Xc values calculated from DSC peaks were 9% and 4% for P3HT-OH and P3HT-C60, respectively.

Morphology control and device optimization
For the preparation of stable polymer solar cells, chemical and physical degradation mechanisms should be considered.29 Chemical degradation of solar cells is mainly caused by the diffusion of oxygen and water into the device, photo-oxidation of conjugated polymers, and chemical reactions between electrode material and the active polymer. In bulk heterojunction solar cells, however, prevention of physical degradation such as large-scale phase separation of active layer morphology is also very important for the stability of the device performance. Hence, it is necessary to monitor the morphology change with the annealing time and to correlate this with the solar cell performance for the device optimization and evaluation of the long-term stability of polymer solar cells.
Since the performance of BHJ solar cells strongly depends on the various processing conditions such as film thickness, donor/acceptor mixing ratio, and thermal annealing time and temperature, all devices for this study were fabricated by using the optimized condition for the standard P3HT/PCBM device: the film thickness, 200 nm; the mixing ratio of P3HT/PCBM, 1/1 by weight; the thermal annealing temperature, 150 °C. To investigate the effect of P3HT-C60 addition on the film morphology and the device performance, 2.5 wt% of P3HT-C60 was added to P3HT/PCBM blend, where 2.5 wt% of P3HT-C60 has been optimized by a separate experiment (see the ESI†).

Fig. 7 shows the dependence of device performance on the annealing time. When the standard P3HT/PCBM is annealed at 150 °C for 15 min, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) value reaches as high as 3.88%, which is the optimized value for the standard device in our experiments, while the standard device shows a PCE of 0.83% before annealing. As the annealing time is further increased, however, the PCE of the standard device rapidly drops below 3% after 1 h annealing. This thermal instability of P3HT/PCBM BHJ solar cells have already been observed by several research groups.9,12,15 However, when 2.5 wt% P3HT-C60 is added to P3HT/PCBM composite, the maximum efficiency of 3.76% has been achieved at 10 min annealing. More importantly, the maximum PCE value of the devices remains nearly unchanged (3.6% after 2 h annealing) when 2.5 wt% P3HT-C60 is added, as the annealing time is further increased, as shown in Fig. 7c. It should be mentioned here that the best efficiency of P3HT/PCBM/P3HT-C60 device is slightly lower than that of the standard P3HT/PCBM device. This is probably because we have used in this study the device fabrication condition that has been optimized only for the standard P3HT/PCBM device.

To investigate the origin of such long-term stability of P3HT/PCBM/P3HT-C60 BHJ device, the morphology change was monitored as a function of annealing time by using TEM. All composite films show phase-separated structure of bright P3HT rich phase and dark PCBM rich phase, as shown in Fig. 8. The TEM image of the as-cast P3HT/PCBM film does not show the morphology with bicontinuous network structure, whereas the nanometre-scale phase morphology with network structure is well developed after 15 min of thermal annealing. This morphology is attributed to yield the optimum efficiency. When the annealing time is further increased, a large aggregation of PCBM is observed. Unlike the standard P3HT/PCBM, however, the as-cast P3HT/PCBM composite film with 2.5 wt% P3HT-C60 shows distinguishable phase separation between P3HT and PCBM without thermal annealing, and the domain size is dramatically decreased down to tens of nanometres after 15 min of annealing, as shown in Fig. 8b. Furthermore, it is notable that the phase size of P3HT/PCBM does not change significantly after 2 h of annealing when 2.5 wt% of P3HT-C60 is added, and the well-defined bicontinuous network morphology also remains nearly unchanged. This observation leads us to conclude that the P3HT-C60 is located at the interface between P3HT and PCBM, and as a result the P3HT-C60 acts as a compatibilizer effectively to suppress macrophase separation.

Long-term thermal stability
To examine the effect of P3HT-C60 on the long-term stability of device performance, the PCEs of P3HT/PCBM/P3HT-C60 devices were measured as a function of annealing time at 150 °C. When the PCEs are plotted against the annealing time, as shown in Fig. 9, it is obvious that the PCE of the standard P3HT/PCBM device exhibits the maximum efficiency at 15 min annealing, and then rapidly decreases below 1% of PCE after 24 h at 150 °C, which is consistent with the value reported in the literature.15 However, the device with the addition of P3HT-C60 shows very stable device performance even after 48 h annealing at 150 °C. The PCE of the device with 2.5 wt% P3HT-C60 slowly decreases and maintains 3% PCE. To the best of our knowledge, the P3HT-C60 is more effective for improving the long-term thermal stability of P3HT/PCBM BHJ solar cells than any other compatibilizers ever reported.

TEM observation was used to investigate the morphology change of blend films after prolonged annealing time at 150 °C. The standard P3HT/PCBM composite film shows large and dense aggregates of PCBM after annealing for 48 h (Fig. 10a), while the P3HT/PCBM/P3HT-C60(2.5 wt%) composite film exhibits a homogeneous film without any PCBM aggregates even after 48 h annealing (Fig. 10b). Moreover, when magnified images of homogeneous parts of both films are compared, it reveals that the domain size of P3HT/PCBM/P3HT-C60 composite is much smaller than that of P3HT/PCBM composite. This observation leads us to conclude that the addition of P3HT-C60 suppresses large-scale phase separation of P3HT/PCBM blend even after the prolonged annealing time, and consequently improves the long-term thermal stability of solar cell performance.

Some theoretical and experimental studies have reported that the aluminium electrode can interact with the active layer materials in the presence of moisture, which may deteriorate the device performance after thermal treatment.30–32 To investigate the possibility that the deterioration of device performance after a long period of thermal annealing is caused by the interface instability between the aluminium electrode and the active layer, the devices (pre-annealed devices) were fabricated by depositing the aluminium electrode on the active layer after thermal treatment at 150 °C and their performances were compared with those of post-annealed devices. When the PCEs of the pre-annealed devices were compared with those of the post-annealed devices, as can be seen in Table 1, the pre-annealed P3HT/PCBM devices exhibit lower efficiencies than the standard post-annealed devices. This observation leads us to conclude that the interface between the active layer and the aluminium electrode is not adversely affected by the long time thermal annealing inside the glove box, and therefore the deterioration of the device performance is mainly caused by the large-scale phase separation of active layer morphology.

Another important issue to estimate the long term stability of solar cell performance is the test temperature. We tested the long term stability of solar cell performance at 150 °C because the temperature of 150 °C has been mostly used to optimize the device performance and control the active layer morphology. However, it is not simple to estimate the device lifetime under atmospheric conditions from the test result at 150 °C. Hence, the PCEs of P3HT/PCBM/P3HT-C60 devices were measured at 100 °C as a function of annealing time, which is closer to the accelerated testing condition.33,34 The PCE of the standard P3HT/PCBM device decreases below 1% of PCE after 140 h at 100 °C, whereas the device with the addition of 2.5 wt% P3HT-C60 exhibits a much smaller decrease in the PCE as compared with the standard P3HT/PCBM device, as shown in Fig. 11. It should be noted that the device with P3HT-C60 records 2.5% PCE after 200 h at 100 °C, which corresponds to thousands of hours at 25 °C according to the Arrhenius model.

As mentioned above, however, there are several other factors than the morphology control of active layer that should be considered for the preparation of stable polymer solar cells. Therefore it is necessary to measure the PCE under continuous illumination and atmospheric conditions for thousands of hours.35,36 Hence, the results reported in this paper may be somewhat far from the realistic conditions and therefore further experiments are needed for commercialization of polymer solar cells.
Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized a new C60-end capped P3HT via GRIM polymerization step followed by directly linking a fullerene derivative to the chain end of P3HT, and used it as a compatibilizer for P3HT/PCBM composite for enhancing long-term thermal stability of solar cell performance. The synthetic simplicity of P3HT-C60 with clear definition of molecular structure provides practical advantages over diblock copolymer compatibilizers.
The addition of a small amount of P3HT-C60 reduces the domain size of the P3HT/PCBM composite and suppresses the macrophase separation for prolonged thermal annealing, resulting in excellent long-term stability of solar cell performance. The improvement of long-term thermal stability of P3HT/PCBM/P3HT-C60 solar cells can be explained by the fact that the addition of P3HT-C60 reduces the interfacial tension between P3HT and PCBM phases, suppressing the phase segregation of P3HT/PCBM composite for prolonged annealing.
Experimental
Materials
A buckminsterfullerene derivative, PCBA, was purchased from Materials Technologies Research (Cleveland, OH). Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over sodium/benzophenone under nitrogen and freshly distilled before use. Regioregular P3HT (55 kDa) was purchased from Rieke Metal Inc. and PCBM (>99.5%) was obtained from Nano-C. These chemicals were used as received without further purification. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron P VP AI 4083) was purchased from H. C. Stark and passed through a 0.45 μm PES syringe filter before spin-coating. All other reagents were purchased from Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, WI) and used as received.
Synthesis of C60-end capped P3HT
First, hydroxypropyl-terminated P3HT was synthesized by following the procedure reported in the literature,17 and then C60-end capped P3HT was synthesized by Steglich esterification of hydroxypropyl-terminated P3HT and PCBA. In a 100 mL round-bottom flask, 0.04 g of hydroxypropyl-terminated P3HT (Mn = 6000, Mw/Mn = 1.12 by GPC) and PCBA (0.045 g, 0.05 mmol) were added, and the flask was degassed under vacuum and backfilled with argon gas. 6 mL of dichlorobenzene/CHCl3 (50/50 v/v) and 0.5 mg of DMAP (0.004 mmol) were added to the reaction mixture, and the solution was sonicated for 30 min to dissolve PCBA completely. Then, 10 mg of 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 0.05 mmol) dissolved in 2 mL of dichlorobenzene/CHCl3 (50/50 v/v) was added dropwise using a syringe, and the solution was stirred for reaction at 30 °C for 3 days. After removal of the solvent, the crude product was dissolved in THF and filtered. Unreacted PCBA was separated by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 30 min), and the supernatant solution was then concentrated and filtered. The centrifugation and filtration step was repeated 3 times, and then precipitated into methanol. The precipitated polymer was filtered and dried under vacuum to give 0.038 g (81% yield) of desired product.
Device fabrication
A mixture of P3HT/PCBM (1/1 by weight) was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at a concentration of 2 wt%, and then 2.5 wt% of P3HT-C60 was added to the solution with respect to the total weight of P3HT/PCBM. The solutions were stirred for 12 h. The photovoltaic devices were fabricated according to the following procedure: ITO-coated glass (15 Ω/square) was cleaned with acetone followed by ultrasonication in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and then was kept at 200 °C for 30 min. After complete drying, ITO-coated glass was treated with UV-ozone. After spin-coating of PEDOT:PSS with 30 nm in thickness, the device was dried at 120 °C for 30 min under a nitrogen atmosphere. P3HT/PCBM (or P3HT/PCBM/P3HT-C60) blend solutions were spin-coated on the top of PEDOT:PSS layer at 700 rpm for 60 s. Al (100 nm thickness) were thermally evaporated under vacuum lower than 10−6 Torr on the top of the active layer. The device was annealed at 150 °C on a digital hot plate under a nitrogen atmosphere inside a glove box.
Characterization and measurements
The chemical structure was identified by a 500 MHz 1H NMR spectrometer (Bruker, Avance 500). FT-IR spectra of all synthesized polymers were obtained on an IR spectrometer (FT/IR-660 plus, Jasco). Molecular weight and its distribution were measured by GPC using THF as an eluent. Molecular weights were reported relative to polystyrene standards. MALDI-TOF MS (Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry Workstation, Applied Biosystems Inc.) was used for estimation of exact molecular weights of synthesized polymers. Thermogravimetric analyses were carried out at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA 2050, TA Instruments). Melting and crystallization temperatures were measured by heating and cooling the sample from 20 to 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 using a differential scanning calorimeter (TA Instruments, 2920 Modulated DSC).
The specimen for TEM measurement was prepared by floating the film from the glass substrate on deionized water and transferring to TEM grid. TEM observation was performed on a LIBRA 120 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. The photovoltaic performance was measured under nitrogen atmosphere inside the glove box. The current density-voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 4200 source-meter under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) simulated by a Newport-Oriel solar simulator. The light intensity was calibrated using a NREL certified photodiode and light source meter prior to each measurement. The active area was determined at 0.04 cm2 by attaching a shadow mask onto solar cell device.
