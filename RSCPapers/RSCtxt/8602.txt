    , Accepted 24th August 2016First published on 25th August 2016AbstractTernary blending is one of the effective strategies to broaden the complementary absorption range and smooth the energy level at the donor/acceptor interface for achieving high efficiency bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this study, we report efficient ternary blend all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) with complementary absorption bands based on two polymer donors PTB7-Th and PBDD-ff4T and one polymer acceptor N2200. The polythiophene derivative PBDD-ff4T as a hole-cascade material plays a bridging role in energy levels between PTB7-Th and N2200, and thus provides more efficient channels for charge transfer. The ternary all-PSCs with 10 wt% PBDD-ff4T content show efficient photon harvesting, enhanced charge mobility and better active layer morphology due to the induced crystallization of PTB7-Th by the inserted PBDD-ff4T in the donor domains. As a result, the device without any extra treatments exhibits an optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.2% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.82 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.7 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 56%. While the PCEs are 5.9% and 4.2% for the all-PSCs based on the binary blends PTB7-Th:N2200 and PBDD-ff4T:N2200, respectively. This PCE of 7.2% is one of the highest values reported in the literature so far for ternary all-PSCs and polythiophene derivative-based all-PSCs.
1. Introduction
As a promising green and renewable energy source technology, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have become the focus of research due to their advantages such as light weight, low cost, simple preparation, and great potential for mass production of large area and flexible solar cell panels.1–7 Nowadays, the state-of-the-art power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction PSCs have been reported to be over 10%.8,9 Among them, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) that consist of a p-type conjugated polymer as the donor and an n-type conjugated polymer as the acceptor have been rapidly developed due to their numerous potential advantages over the conventional polymer:PCBM-based PSCs, such as easily tunable absorption and molecular energy levels and better morphological stability of the polymer acceptor in comparison with the fullerene derivative.10–18 So far, the state-of-the-art PCE of the all-PSCs has been reported to be over 8%.13,14 Among them, the naphthalene diimide-containing n-type conjugated polymer acceptor, N2200, has been well studied for application in all-PSCs due to its broad light absorption spectrum, high electron affinity and electron mobility.10–14 Through a synergistic effect of selecting the appropriate donor and optimizing the active layer morphology, the PCE of all-PSCs based on the N2200 acceptor has been rapidly promoted from the initial lower than 1% to the present 5–8%.10–14 However, the PCEs of all-PSCs are still lower than the optimal PCEs of the polymer:PCBM-based PSCs due to some disadvantages such as anisotropic charge transport properties of the polymer acceptor,19 the poorer donor/acceptor interpenetrating network morphology,16 and weak absorbance of the n-type polymer acceptor.20,21
To overcome these problems, one of the promising strategies for achieving high performance all-PSCs is to introduce a second polymer donor component with appropriate absorption, energy levels and crystallinity as an alloy and bridge into the all-PSC system. For example, Ito and co-workers reported the ternary blend all-PSCs of PCDTBT:PTB7-Th:N2200.20 The introduction of wide band-gap polymer PCDTBT as a hole-cascade material into PTB7-Th:N2200 leads to improved short circuit current density (Jsc) and PCEs due to the complementary absorption. However, the ternary active layer of all-PSCs requires not only complementary absorption bands from the visible to near-infrared region but also sufficient free charge carrier generation and effective charge transport properties. Recently, increasing the donor polymer crystallinity has been proven to be an effective method for reducing burn-in voltage loss in PSCs.22 Very recently, Groves also reported a strategy for improving charge transport and charge extraction, and for suppressing geminate charge recombination in PSCs by introducing a high crystallinity donor polymer as a cascaded energy heterojunction.23 Therefore, the selection of the ideal second polymer donor with high crystallinity, appropriate absorption and energy levels to match the existing polymer donor and polymer acceptor in all-PSCs is still the key to improving the efficiency of all-PSCs.
In this work, we used a moderate-bandgap polythiophene (PT) derivative PBDD-ff4T with deeper LUMO and HOMO energy levels and high crystallinity,24 as a hole-cascade material in all-PSCs based on PTB7-Th:N2200 (see Fig. 1a). And we also prepared two all-PSCs based on PTB7-Th:N2200 and PBDD-ff4T:N2200 as control devices. With 10 wt% PBDD-ff4T in the active layer, the ternary all-PSC shows efficient photon harvesting, enhanced charge mobility and a better active layer morphology. As a result, the ternary all-PSC without any extra treatments exhibits an optimized PCE of 7.2% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.82 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.7 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 56%. The PCEs of the control devices are 5.9% and 4.2% for the all-PSCs based on PTB7-Th:N2200 and PBDD-ff4T:N2200 respectively. The PCE of 7.2% is one of the highest values reported in the literature so far for ternary all-PSCs and polythiophene derivative-based all-PSCs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Absorption and electronic energy levels of the photovoltaic materials
As shown in Fig. 1b, the ternary all-polymer blend provides broad absorption spectra covering the wavelengths from visible to NIR regions (300–850 nm) due to the fact that the absorption of PBDD-ff4T in the visible region is complementary to those of the other two polymers PTB7-Th and N2200. Therefore, the ternary all-polymer blend film has a more favorable optical absorption than that of the binary polymer blends PTB7-Th:N2200 and PBDD-ff4T:N2200, which is beneficial to obtain a higher Jsc for the ternary all-PSCs.
The electronic energy level diagrams of these polymers are presented in Fig. 1c. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PBDD-ff4T are lower than those of PTB7-Th, but higher than those of N2200, which is favorable for forming a smooth energy gradient between PTB7-Th and N2200. Therefore, the introduction of PBDD-ff4T as a hole-cascade material plays a bridging role which can significantly reduce the energy loss during exciton dissociation by smoothing the energy level between PTB7-Th and N2200.19,25 Furthermore, the introduction of PBDD-ff4T can effectively increase the channels of charge transfer (PTB7-Th/PBDD-ff4T, PBDD-ff4T/N2200 and PTB7-Th/N2200) at the bulk interface of ternary blend devices,26 more than that (one route) in the binary PTB7-Th/N2200 counterpart.
We have also carried out the XRD test to measure the crystalline properties of these polymers. As shown in Fig. 1d, the pure PBDD-ff4T film shows a clear and intense (100) diffraction peak and the additional (200) and (300) diffraction peaks compared to other two polymers PTB7-Th and N2200, which implies that PBDD-ff4T has a better crystallinity. Therefore, the introduction of the highly crystalline PBDD-ff4T as a donor alloy material is beneficial to the formation of phase separation in the blend films due to the crystalline PBDD-ff4T being fully embedded in PTB7-Th (see the schematic diagram in Fig. 1e). The smooth energy gradient and the good blend morphology can suppress geminate charge recombination,22,23 resulting in more effective charge generation and transportation.
2.2 Photovoltaic performance of the ternary all-PSCs
We fabricated ternary all-PSCs with the device structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:PBDD-ff4T:N2200/MoO3/Al, where the ZnO and MoO3 were used as the n-type (electron-transporting) and p-type (hole-transporting) interlayers, respectively. The active layers of the PTB7-Th:N2200-based all-PSCs were optimized first from chlorobenzene (CB) solution with a solid concentration of 9 mg mL−1, and the corresponding weight ratio of PTB7-Th:N2200 was 1.5:1. In the PTB7-Th:PBDD-ff4T:N2200-based ternary all-PSCs, PBDD-ff4T was added to the PTB7-Th:N2200 binary blend, where the weight content of PBDD-ff4T in the ternary blends changed from 0 to 30 wt% with the PTB7-Th:N2200 weight ratio remaining constant at 1.5:1. Here, the film thicknesses of the ternary blends were optimized at ≈90 nm. We also fabricated binary all-PSCs based on PBDD-ff4T:N2200 (1.5:1, w/w, with 60 wt% PBDD-ff4T) for comparison.

Fig. 2a and b show the current density–voltage (J–V) curves under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 irradiation and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the all-PSCs with different PBDD-ff4T contents, where the curves of 60 wt% PBDD-ff4T are for the binary all-PSCs based on PBDD-ff4T:N2200 with a D/A weight ratio of 1.5:1. Fig. 2c–f show the dependence of the photovoltaic performance (with error bars) of the all-PSCs on the amount of PBDD-ff4T loading. Table 1 shows the average Voc, Jsc, fill factor (FF), PCE values and the best PCE value of the devices with different PBDD-ff4T contents.

The PTB7-Th:N2200-based all-PSCs used as a control device gave a PCE of 5.9% with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 13.9 mA cm−2, and a FF of 53%. It is clear from Fig. 2 that the PBDD-ff4T content in the ternary blends strongly affects the device performances such as Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE. In most ternary blend systems, Voc is determined by the donor component with the higher HOMO level due to the fact that the dominant hole transport and collection occur through the donor component with the higher HOMO level.27 However, when “alloy-like donor materials” were formed by using compatible polymers, both donor materials collect holes, such that the Voc values of the ternary all-PSCs based on PTB7-Th:PBDD-ff4T:N2200 were between those of the binary all-PSCs28 based on PTB7-Th:N2200 and PBDD-ff4T:N2200. Fig. 2c shows that the Voc values of the ternary all-PSCs slightly increase from 0.80 to 0.83 V with increasing PBDD-ff4T content from 0 wt% to 30 wt% in the ternary blends. As shown in Fig. 2d, the average Jsc values of the all-PSCs increased significantly from 12.6 to 15.4 mA cm−2 with the increase of PBDD-ff4T ratios and reached the maximum at a PBDD-ff4T ratio of 10 wt%; and then, the Jsc values decreased with further increase of PBDD-ff4T content. This phenomenon is consistent with the EQE spectra of the ternary blend devices. As shown in Fig. 2b, the EQE values of the ternary all-PSCs were remarkably enhanced in the wavelength range from 350 to 750 nm with the increase of PBDD-ff4T ratios from 0 wt% to 15 wt% and reached the maximum at a PBDD-ff4T ratio of 10 wt%. On further increasing the PBDD-ff4T ratio higher than 10 wt%, the EQE values decreased in the wavelength range of 600–700 nm due to the weakening of the light absorption in the corresponding spectral range (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). According to the EQE curves and the solar irradiation spectrum, the error between the integrated Jsc values from EQE data and the measured average Jsc values is below 4%. In addition, the average FF values of the ternary all-PSCs increased significantly from 51% to 55% with the increase of the PBDD-ff4T ratio and reached the maximum at a PBDD-ff4T ratio of 10 wt%. It is noted that the introduction of 10 wt% PBDD-ff4T in the ternary blends has significantly improved the Jsc and FF values of the ternary all-PSCs compared to the binary PSCs based on PTB7-Th:N2200. The improvement of the photovoltaic performance could be attributed to the alloy hole-cascade effect of PBDD-ff4T with a highly crystalline structure in the ternary blends, which promoted the charge transportation and suppressed geminate charge recombination of the ternary all-PSCs23 (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†).
It should be mentioned that the weight ratio of PTB7-Th:N2200 is kept at 1.5:1 in the ternary blend films when the PBDD-ff4T content was changed from 5 wt% to 30 wt%. Therefore, the increase of the PBDD-ff4T content results in more donor materials and less acceptor materials. The optimized PBDD-ff4T content in the ternary all-PSCs is 10 wt% as mentioned above. The decrease of the photovoltaic performance of the ternary all-PSCs with the PBDD-ff4T content over 10 wt% could also be ascribed to the decrease of the N2200 polymer acceptor content in the active layers.
The charge carrier mobilities of active layers in the PSCs were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.29 The calculated hole/electron mobilities are 5.47/0.64 × 10−4, 9.51/0.92 × 10−4, 12.3/2.23 × 10−4, 7.67/1.03 × 10−4, 6.16/0.88 × 10−4 and 7.22/0.95 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the ternary all-PSCs with 0 wt%, 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 15 wt%, 20 wt% and 30 wt% weight ratios of PBDD-ff4T respectively in the ternary blends, and 6.45/0.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the binary all-PSCs based on PBDD-ff4T:N2200. The higher and balanced hole and electron mobilities should be beneficial to the higher FF and PCE values for the ternary all-PSCs with 10 wt% of PBDD-ff4T. Therefore, when the ratio of PBDD-ff4T is 10 wt%, the ternary device shows the higher Voc, Jsc and FF, thereby, achieving the maximum efficiency. As a result, the average PCE increased from 5.5% to 6.9%. The ternary all-PSCs displayed the highest PCE of up to 7.2% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 15.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 56%, which is the highest reported PCE for ternary all-PSCs and polythiophene derivative-based all-PSCs. Note that the high efficiency of 7.2% is ≈23% higher than that (5.9%) of the PTB7-Th:N2200-based all-PSCs and it was achieved without any extra treatments.
To better understand the effect of the PBDD-ff4T content on the photovoltaic performance of ternary all-PSCs, we also fabricated two additional binary all-PSCs based on PBDD-ff4T:N2200 (1.5:1, w/w) and PTB7-Th:PBDD-ff4T (1:1, w/w). As shown in Fig. 2, the Voc of the device based on PBDD-ff4T:N2200 was 0.93 V, which is much higher than that of the ternary all-PSCs mentioned above, because the Voc of the ternary all-PSCs is determined by the donor component (PTB7-Th) with the higher HOMO level.28 However, the EQE values of the device based on PBDD-ff4T:N2200 were limited to 40% in all wavelength regions, resulting in a lower average Jsc of 7.9 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 4.0%.
The device based on PTB7-Th:PBDD-ff4T (1:1, w/w) displayed a low PCE of 0.049% with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 0.203 mA cm−2, and a FF of 33% (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†) because of the poor electron transporting properties of the two donor polymers. Although the photovoltaic performance of the device based on the blend of the two polymer donors is poor, the observed Voc and Jsc values still prove that the charge separation and transportation occurred at the interface of PTB7-Th and PBDD-ff4T. This result is also consistent with the increase of EQE values of the ternary all-PSCs in the PBDD-ff4T absorption range.
2.3 Morphology analysis
To understand the relationship between photovoltaic properties of the surface and bulk morphologies of the ternary all-PSCs and the ternary blend films, we carried out the measurements of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of active layers with different weight ratios of PBDD-ff4T in the ternary blend films. The bright region is the donor PTB7-Th and PBDD-ff4T rich domain, and the dark region is the acceptor N2200 rich domain in the TEM images. It can be seen that the bright donor rich region of the ternary blend films increased with the increase of PBDD-ff4T content from 0 wt% to 30 wt%, which means that PBDD-ff4T can only induce the crystallization of PTB7-Th due to the fact that PBDD-ff4T can be fully embedded in PTB7-Th. The PTB7-Th:N2200 binary blend film shows a negligible phase separation (Fig. 3a). When 5 wt% PBDD-ff4T was added to the ternary blend film, the TEM image showed the phase separation, but it was not obvious (Fig. 3b). The ternary blend film with 10 wt% PBDD-ff4T content shows a bicontinuous D/A interpenetrating network and suitable pure phase domain size, which would be beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transportation, and thus higher Jsc, FF and PCE values can be obtained. Thereafter the phase separation of the ternary blends gradually increases with increasing PBDD-ff4T with high crystallinity content from 10 wt% to 30 wt% in the ternary blends. In general, too large phase separation will seriously hinder the exciton dissociation and charge transportation. As a result, the ternary all-PSCs with 30 wt% PBDD-ff4T content in the ternary blends show a significantly decreased average Jsc compared to the ternary all-PSCs with 10 wt% PBDD-ff4T content. Fig. S4 in the ESI† shows the AFM images of active layers with different weight ratios of PBDD-ff4T in the ternary blend films. Interestingly, the ternary blend films with PBDD-ff4T content from 5 wt% to 30 wt% show very similar surfaces, and the corresponding root-mean-square (RMS) values are from 0.742 to 0.765 nm for the ternary blend films. The PBDD-ff4T:N2200 binary blend film exhibits the biggest RMS value of 1.81 nm. In a word, the RMS values of all the ternary blend films were about 0.75 nm, although the PBDD-ff4T content was changed, which was significantly lower than that of the binary blend films (Fig. 3h).
 Fig. 3  TEM images of the ternary blend films based on PTB7-Th:PBDD-ff4T:N2200 with different PBDD-ff4T contents of (a) 0 wt% (without PBDD-ff4T), (b) 5 wt%, (c) 10 wt%, (d) 15 wt%, (e) 20 wt%, (f) 30 wt% and (g) the binary blend film based on PBDD-ff4T:N2200 (60 wt%); (h) RMS values of the ternary blend films based on PTB7-Th:PBDD-ff4T:N2200 with different PBDD-ff4T contents where 60 wt% is for the binary blend film based on PBDD-ff4T:N2200 with a D/A weight ratio of 1.5:1. 
We also carried out the XRD test to investigate the effect of introducing PBDD-ff4T on the properties of the blend films. As shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI,† the PTB7-Th:PBDD-ff4T:N2200 blend film with 10 wt% PBDD-ff4T content shows a sharper and larger (100) diffraction peak at 2θ ≈ 4.34° (d-spacing of 20.3 Å) and a (010) diffraction peak at 2θ ≈ 22.76° (π–π stacking distance of 3.90 Å) compared to the PTB7-Th:N2200 blend film with a (100) diffraction peak at 2θ ≈ 3.77° (d-spacing of 23.5 Å) and a (010) diffraction peak at 2θ ≈ 22.47° (π–π stacking distance of 3.95 Å), which implies that the ternary blend film with 10 wt% PBDD-ff4T content has a smaller lamellar stacking and π–π stacking spacing due to the enhanced crystallinity of the donor polymers by introducing a small amount of PBDD-ff4T. The smaller lamellar stacking and π–π stacking distances of the ternary blend film would be beneficial for charge transportation, and thus for increasing the Jsc and FF in PSCs. Notably, the PBDD-ff4T:N2200-based PSCs show a significantly decreased Jsc value although the blend film shows the smallest lamellar stacking (d-spacing of 17.5 Å) and a π–π stacking distance of 3.83 Å, which is attributed to the related blend film having a larger pure donor polymer crystallite size that hinders the exciton dissociation and charge transportation. This result is consistent with the TEM test (see Fig. 3).
2.4 Photoluminescence quenching properties
For investigating the exciton dissociation and charge transfer behavior between the polymer donors and the N2200 acceptor, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of three pure polymers, and the related binary and ternary D/A blend films were measured. We selected the excitation wavelengths of 620 nm for PTB7-Th, 600 nm for PBDD-ff4T, 420 and 690 nm for N2200 in the PL quenching experiment. Fig. 4 shows the PL spectra of the D/A blend films in comparison with those of the related pure polymer films. When using the excitation wavelength of 620 nm (Fig. 4a), the ternary PTB7-Th:PBDD-ff4T:N2200 blend film demonstrated effectively 95.5% PL quenching in comparison with the PL spectrum of pure PTB7-Th, which is higher than that of the binary PTB7-Th:N2200 blend film (91.8% PL quenching). A similar phenomenon has been observed at other excitation wavelengths such as 600 nm (Fig. 4b for PBDD-ff4T and the related blend films), 420 and 690 nm (Fig. 4c and d for N2200 and the related blend films) for the PL quenching experiment. To further clarify the working mechanism of the ternary all-PSCs, we also investigated the intermolecular interaction between PBDD-ff4T and PBT7-Th by measuring the PL spectra26e,f of the PBDD-ff4T/PBT7-Th blend films with different blend ratios. As shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI,† the PL intensity of the PBDD-ff4T/PBT7-Th blend films showed gradual weakening with the increase of PBDD-ff4T content, which indicates that PBDD-ff4T can effectively quench the PL intensity of PBT7-Th. These results indicate that the introduction of the highly crystalline PBDD-ff4T as a hole-cascade material into the ternary blend films is an effective strategy to promote the exciton dissociation and charge transfer between polymer donors and polymer acceptors.
 Fig. 4  The PL spectra of the polymers and the related binary and ternary blend films (excited at 620 nm for PTB7-Th and the related blend films, 600 nm for PBDD-ff4T and the related blend films, 420 and 690 nm for N2200 and the related blend films). 
2.5 Energy loss of the all-PSCs
In PSCs, the energy loss (Eloss), defined by Eloss = Eoptg − eVoc, where Eoptg is the lowest optical bandgap of the donor and acceptor materials, is also an important parameter to interpret the Voc of the devices.30–32 Generally, few PSCs can simultaneously obtain a low Eloss and a high Jsc. In this study, the lowest Eoptg is 1.46 eV for acceptor N2200 from its absorption edge (849 nm). Compared to the devices based on PTB7-Th:N2200 (Voc = 0.80 V, Eloss = 0.66 eV), the ternary all-PSCs with 10 wt% ratio PBDD-ff4T show a lower Eloss of 0.64 eV (Voc = 0.82 V) due to the fact that the introduction of an appropriate amount of highly crystalline PBDD-ff4T in the ternary blend films can increase the Voc value of the ternary all-PSCs.22,23 The Eloss of 0.64 eV is very close to the empirically low threshold of 0.6 eV.31 Notably, the Jsc as high as 15.7 mA cm−2 was obtained simultaneously, even though the Eloss is lower than 0.7 eV. Usually, the corresponding Jsc generally dropped to less than 10 mA cm−2 for the PSCs with low Eloss.32 Such small Eloss along with high Jsc benefit from the smooth energy level gradient at the donor/acceptor interface and the bulk morphologies with a suitable pure phase domain size.
3. Conclusions
Efficient ternary all-PSCs based on PTB7-Th:PBDD-ff4T:N2200 were fabricated, in which PBDD-ff4T was fully embedded in PTB7-Th to form a donor alloy. By inserting highly crystalline PBDD-ff4T into the binary PTB7-Th:N2200 system, ternary all-PSC devices show complementary absorption spectra, a smooth energy level gradient, more energy transfer channels, much higher and balanced charge carrier transport, and optimized morphologies. As a result, the ternary all-PSCs with 10 wt% PBDD-ff4T without any extra treatments exhibit an optimized PCE of 7.2% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 15.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 56%. This value of PCE is one of the highest values reported in the literature so far for ternary all-PSCs and polythiophene derivative-related all-PSCs. Our results indicate that the ternary all-PSCs are an effective way in complementing the absorption spectra and smoothing the electronic energy level gradient for achieving efficient non-fullerene PSCs.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials

PBDD-ff4T was prepared according to our previously reported methods.24aPTB7-Th and N2200 were synthesized according to the method reported in the literature. The ZnO solution used to form the cathode buffer layers was obtained according to the literature.33 Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals and solvents were of reagent grade and commercially available products.
4.2 Fabrication of ternary all-PSCs
The device was fabricated with a structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Al. The ZnO layer was deposited by spin-coating on top of a pre-cleaned and UV-ozone-treated ITO-coated glass substrate. Then the device was transferred to a nitrogen glovebox. The active layer was then deposited on top of the ZnO layer by spin-coating from a 9 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solution of PTB7-Th:N2200, or PBDD-ff4T:N2200 or PTB7-TH:PBDD-ff4T:N2200 to obtain a film thickness of ≈90 nm. The weight ratio of PTB7-Th:N2200 was 1.5:1 in the ternary blend films. Finally, 10 nm MoO3 and 80 nm Al were successively deposited on the photosensitive layer under vacuum at a pressure of ca. 4 × 10−4 Pa. The overlapping area between the cathode and anode defined a pixel size of 0.04 cm−2.
4.3 Characterization
The J–V characteristics of the PSCs were recorded with a Keithley 2450. The PCEs of the PSCs were measured under 1 sun, AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2, using a SS-F5-3A (Enli Technology CO., Ltd.) solar simulator (AAA grade). A 2 × 2 cm−2 monocrystalline silicon reference cell (SRC-00019) was purchased from Enli Technology CO., Ltd. The EQE was measured by using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enli Technology CO., Ltd.). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The film thickness was determined by using a Profilometer (Ambios Tech. XP-2). UV-vis absorption spectra were taken on an Agilent Technologies Cary Series UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer. XRD measurements were performed using a Bruker D8 Advance Instrument at 40 kV voltage and 200 mA current with Cu Kα radiation. PL spectra were taken on an Edinburgh Instrument FLS 980. AFM measurements were performed on a Dimension 3100 (Veeco) Atomic Force Microscope in the tapping mode. TEM was performed using a Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN instrument at 200 kV accelerating voltage.
