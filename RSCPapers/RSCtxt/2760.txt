    , Accepted 21st February 2021First published on 27th February 2021AbstractPolyaniline (PANI) is a conductive polymer that has been studied intensively due to its high conductivity, ease of synthesis, fascinating doping mechanism, and a broad spectrum of applications. Polyaniline doped HCl was synthesized by a common direct-oxidation method of aniline using ammonium persulfate as the oxidant in HCl solution at various temperatures. This study focused on conductivity alteration of PANI-ES (emeraldine salt) due to the interchain interaction observed at different reaction temperatures from room temperature down to −15 °C. The molecular structure of PANI-ES was determined by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. At low reaction temperature, the electronic transport properties improve significantly as reflected by its conductivity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that the value d{(110)} and β play an important role in electron transport through face-to-face and side-to-side interactions, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that the morphology of the synthesized PANI-ES consists of granules that are interconnected by nanofibers. Here, the correlation between electronic transport properties, structure, and morphology induced by reaction temperature was analyzed and discussed in detail. Moreover, PANI ES synthesized at 0 °C was applied as an electrocatalytic active layer in the DSSC's counter-electrode with a promising result.
Introduction
The development of photovoltaic devices tends to adopt organic conductive polymer materials as an active component due to the ease to fabricate at low temperatures and can be applied onto a large-area flexible substrate. One of the promising conducting polymers which is inexpensive and easy to be synthesized is polyaniline (PANI).1 Emeraldine salt polyaniline (PANI-ES) has attracted much attention due to its good environmental stability, low-cost synthesis, good conductivity, and a wide range of commercial and technological applications. PANI-ES is widely applied as a counter electrode material in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications due to its good electrocatalytic activity towards a redox couple electrolyte.2–4 Furthermore, PANI-ES has also been used as a hole injection layer due to its low threshold voltage in an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) with high efficiency, despite its high absorption in visible light than ITO.5–7 This made PANI-ES a promising material for conductive substrate and charge carrier collecting layers in organic-based electronic devices. However, the synthesis of high conductive PANI for organic photovoltaic cell applications is still a challenge because it depends on synthesis history or reaction conditions.
Therefore, many types of research have been carried out to optimize the synthesis of PANI-ES by varying reaction methods8 and parameters to obtain high conductive polymers, i.e., pH,9 mechanical stirring,10 dopants,11,12 and reaction temperature.13–16 Controlling reaction temperature is the easiest way to obtain PANI with a wide range of conductivity. In general, low polymerization temperature tends to produce PANI-ES with a more ordered structure and improved electrical conductivity.14–16 Recently, Blaha et al. reported a more comprehensive study that discussed correlations among reaction temperature, structural features, and electrical conductivity.16 However, the detailed information about the relationship between electron transport and PANI-ES structure, including morphology, is not clearly explained. Thus, in this research, PANI-ES samples were synthesized using a standard HCl doping method at various reaction temperatures from room temperature (25 °C) down to −15 °C with 5 °C of intervals to reveal the detailed contribution of structure on its electron transport properties.
Experimental
Materials
Analytical grade reagents such as acetone, aniline, ammonium persulfate, and hydrochloric acid were purchased from Merck. All chemicals were used without any further purification, except for aniline, which was distilled prior to polymerization. Deionized water was produced using the Millipore Simplicity water purification system installed in our laboratory.
Synthesis of PANI-ES
1.82 mL (20 mmol) of aniline was dissolved in 50 mL of 1 M HCl solution and kept for an hour. 5.71 g (25 mmol) of ammonium persulfate was dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water and kept for an hour. Ammonium persulfate was then introduced dropwise into the aniline-HCl solution and continuously stirred at 250 rpm. This mixture was kept for 1 day at the desired temperature (from −15 to 25 °C) to let the polymerization reaction be accomplished. The precipitated PANI was then collected through filtration using filter paper, followed by washing three times with 1 M HCl solution and acetone sequentially. The obtained solid PANI-ES was then dried in an oven at 60 °C for a day.
Characterizations
IR absorption spectra were recorded using a Bruker Alpha FTIR spectrometer at a transmission mode with 4 cm−1 spectral resolution. A certain amount of synthesized PANI-ES was ground into a homogenous powder, and KBr was then added to the mixture, with the PANI-ES/KBr weight ratio being about 1:10. The mixture was then ground into homogeneous pale green powder before being introduced into a molding ring. Then, it was pressed into a semi-transparent pellet prior to the IR absorption spectral acquisition. Raman spectra were obtained using a Bruker Senterra Raman microscope. The microscope was equipped with an Olympus long working distance MPlan semi-apochromatic objective lens (50×). The samples were excited with a 785 nm diode laser at 1 mW. The spectrometer was equipped with an Andor iDus DU420A CCD detector. During the measurement, the CCD detector was set into a deep-cool mode at −80 °C. The spectra were obtained in the range of 60–3500 cm−1 with 3–5 cm−1 spectral resolution and acquisition time of 30 seconds. The diffraction pattern of PANI-ES was determined by the powder XRD method using a Philips PW1710 diffractometer with a Cu Kα line (1.54439 Å). Lattice parameters of PANI-ES were obtained from the refinement of XRD data using Rietica software with the Le Bail method. Amorphous contents were determined by fitting the XRD pattern using a log-normal probability density function. Electrical conductivity measurements of PANI-ES were carried out using a two-electrode AC impedance technique on an Agilent E4890A precision LCR meter with a working frequency of 20 kHz–2 MHz. All samples were ground into fine homogeneous powder and then pressed into a dense pellet prior to the electrical conductivity measurements. The morphology of PANI-ES was observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) JEOL–JSM-6510 at 20 kV in a secondary electron image (SEI) mode with two magnifications. All characterizations were carried out at 20 °C with relative humidity below 50%. Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of a Newport ORIEL S013A solar simulator (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2 ) on DSSCs with an active area of 0.81 cm2.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows that the electrical conductivity of PANI-ES decreases with polymerization temperature. Measurement conductivity of the synthesized PANI-ES sample at −15 °C shows the highest electrical conductivity. Temperature enhancement from −15 to −5 °C decreases electrical conductivity significantly, while a further increase of temperature up to 25 °C only slightly decreases the conductivity.
 Fig. 1  Both electrical conductivity and total Drude electron density of PANI-ES decrease with polymerization temperature. The total Drude electron density plot was obtained based on the frequency response of conductivity data (Bode plot) using eqn (3) (Fig. S1a, ESI†). 
It has been reported that electronic transport of PANI-ES can be described using the Drude model.1,17 The Drude electronic conduction model explains the transport properties of electrons in solids.18 It can be described by the following equation: (1)here n, e, m*, τ, and σ are the density of free electrons (Drude electrons), the charge of an electron, the effective mass of a charge carrier, mean free time between collisions, and electrical conductivity, respectively. Eqn (1) can be formulated to explain the density of free electrons as a function of frequency as follows: (2a) (2b)
Then eqn (2b) is integrated based on the expansion of σ = f(ω), where n is distributed in the interval Δω, with the assumptions of m* ≈ 2me1,19 and mean free path l ≈ 1 nm19–21 for conducting polymers, thus under the boundary condition, it can be written as:19,22,23 (3)Fig. 1 shows the free electron's total density as a function of polymerization temperature that is calculated from the frequency response of conductivity data (Bode plot) using eqn (3) (see Fig. S1, ESI† for details). The calculation results reflect the charge mobility of PANI in the range of 0.39–0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, which is in good agreement with the previously reported results.24–26 The electrical conductivity and total density of electrons in PANI-ES show the same tendency with polymerization temperature. The fall of the total Drude electrons in PANI-ES is by increasing temperature from −15 to −5 °C, followed by a slight decrease up to 25 °C, revealing that the Drude electrons mostly contribute to the electrical conductivity of PANI-ES.
The electrical conductivity of PANI-ES is hypothesized to depend on the following factors: (a) the presence of polarons in the PANI chain formed when PANI is doped by a dopant,27 (b) π–π stacking between phenyl rings along the chain and side interaction between PANI chains through face-to-face interaction is supported by the presence of a strong peak at 25° in XRD patterns,28,29 and (c) degree of crystallinity or amorphous content.30,31 This means that the structure of PANI plays a vital role in its electronic transport.

Fig. 2 shows the amorphous content of synthesized PANI-ES, which increases with polymerization temperature. Here, the degree of crystallinity of PANI-ES under study is around 40–50%, as commonly reported.30,32,33 An ordered crystalline region provides delocalization with the metallic state, while a disorder amorphous region tends to localize the charge carriers.33,34 The difference in conductivity between crystalline and amorphous PANI-ES can spread from 4 to 6 orders of magnitude.30,31 The amorphous content increases monotonically from 50.90% at −15 °C to 55.35% at 25 °C (see Table S1, ESI†). The increase in amorphous content from −15 to 25 °C only decreases the degree of crystallinity by 10%. The increase of amorphous content with polymerization temperature still keeps the degree of crystallinity higher than 40%, far beyond the percolation threshold of polyaniline. The previously reported electrical conductivity percolation threshold for polyaniline is in the range of 0.3–3%.35,36 This signifies that the amorphous phase of PANI-ES might not play a significant role in the electrical conductivity with respect to the crystalline phase.

From previous experiments, XRD peaks of PANI-ES at 2θ = 20°, 25° and 27° assigned as diffraction planes {(100)}, {(110)}, and {(111)} with d-spacings d{(100)}, d{(110)}, and d{(111)}, respectively.37 The value of d{(hkl)} represents the d-spacing of the (hkl) diffraction plane permutation. XRD patterns of PANI-ES samples result in the presence of three main diffraction peaks: two weak peaks at 2θ ≈ 20° and 27°, and a strong peak at 2θ ≈ 25° (Fig. 3a).37 The peak at 20° is assigned as the {(100)} diffraction plane with d-spacing d{(100)}, describing the side-to-side interaction. Meanwhile, the peak at 25° corresponds to the {(110)} diffraction plane with d-spacing d{(110)}, indicating the crystallinity due to parallel and perpendicular periodicity among adjacent phenyl rings in polyaniline, respectively (see the inset in Fig. 3b), which highlights the face-to-face interaction. The peak at 27° is assigned as the {(111)} diffraction plane with d-spacing d{(111)}. This peak has a similar interaction with d-spacing d{(100)}, but it tends to create a diagonal face-to-face interaction. These diffraction patterns correspond to the presence of crystalline regions that are dispersed in an amorphous medium.1 In general, all samples have similar XRD patterns. However, it can still be observed that lowering the reaction temperature tends to increase the crystallinity and crystallite size as reflected by the narrowing of diffraction peaks, notably the peak at 25°.

As previously reported, the diffraction peak at around 25° corresponds to the {(110)} diffraction plane with d-spacing d{(110)} that directly contributes to conductivity in HCl doped PANI. From the refinement using Le Bail analysis, the lattice parameter for the sample synthesized at different temperatures can be determined (Fig. 3b). In PANI-ES, which has a space group of P21 in the monoclinic crystal system,38 the value of d(hkl) can be calculated using eqn (4). Table S2 (ESI†) presents the lattice parameters of PANI determined by the Le Bail method. (4)

Fig. 3b shows a local minimum in the temperature range of 0–10 °C for d{(110)} that reflects the minimum distance of face-to-face interchain stacking between phenyl rings along the chain that forms diffraction plane {(110)} as shown in the inset. This also means that the interchain packing is optimum along the [110] direction.29 Let us compare the effect of temperature on d{(110)} to the electrical conductivity shown in Fig. 3b. It is evident that the optimum conductivity will be attained at d{(110)} around 5.3 Å. When d{(110)} is optimum, π–π stacking is formed, and delocalization of electrons occurs among the chains (transparent green area in the inset). Under this condition, the electron can flow through the polaron transfer to another potential with relatively lower activation energy, thus increasing the electrical conductivity due to delocalization spreading, as shown schematically in Fig. 4a and b. This polaron transfer can be explained by the Marcus–Emin–Holstein–Austin–Mott theory (Fig. 4).39–41 In the adiabatic case, the thermal hopping is the main mechanism of the polaron transfer. If a strong interaction occurs, the activation energy is lowered, thus the polaron transfer becomes more favorable.39,40
 Fig. 4  Schematic of PANI-ES interchain potential at various face-to-face interchain distance d{(110)}. (a) At large separation, the distance of face-to-face interchain (d{(110)}) is large, thus, the electron is difficult to be transported between potentials due to a minimum overlap region of π orbitals that leads to a high activation energy. (b) At optimum separation, the electron can flow to another potential with low activation energy when d{(110)} is optimum (optimum overlap π–π stacking). (c) At very close separation, the overlap region becomes very large and creates a spread delocalized environment for polarons, thus, electrons can move around in a large potential well. Moreover, the considerable overlap can also create localized excited states that can trap electrons. Therefore, crystallites with optimum d{(110)} are required to produce PANI-ES with high electrical conductivity. 
A polaron as a charge carrier is naturally self-trapped by a potential well due to the structural deformation, i.e., lattice deformation, disorder, dangling bonds, impurities, etc.42–46 When the temperature increases, the value of d{(110)} tends to decrease, thus the conductivity decreases up to 20 °C. At the local minimum, the d{(110)} distance becomes very close and leads to form a larger overlap region. This condition can create a spread delocalized environment that stabilizes or traps the polarons to move around in a large potential well among the polymer chains46 (see Fig. 4c), i.e., in a crystallite domain. This kind of delocalization is called “large” polarons, where the charge carriers are trapped over large delocalized sites through a long-range interaction.46,47 The delocalization among the polymer chains due to the d{(110)} distance is in analogy with the increase of the cross-section of a nanowire that decreases the electrical conductivity along the wire.48,49 This overlap provides a strong interaction at the molecular level, which cannot be simply figured from its crystallite size. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the crystallite size along the [110] direction that decreases from ≈15 (7.98 nm) to ≈4 (2.24 nm) unit cells with polymerization temperature. Moreover, the considerable overlap can also create localized excited states that can trap charge carriers.50 Therefore, crystallites with optimum d{(110)} are required to produce PANI-ES with high electrical conductivity. However, at 25 °C, the value of d{(110)} increases significantly up to 5.8 Å. When d{(110)} is too large, the electron is difficult to move between PANI-ES interchain potentials because of the high activation energy that results in a low conductivity (Fig. 4a). Based on this result, we can suggest that an optimum value of d{(110)} is required to facilitate the transport of electrons among polymer chains in solid HCl doped PANI.
From Table S2 (ESI†), the electrical conductivity as a function of temperature not only depends on diffraction plane {(110)}, but also on β. Fig. 3c shows schematically how the angle β contributes to the packing of the PANI-ES chain along the a-axis in a monoclinic unit cell. As the temperature increases, if we compare the conditions at −15 and −10 °C, β becomes larger, but d{(110)} tends to decrease, and electrical conductivity decreases significantly. This condition implies that the PANI-ES interchain's distance becomes closer in the crystal lattice, as illustrated in Fig. 5b. In PANI-ES, separation of electrons emerges when bipolarons of PANI become polarons.27 Flowing polarons in PANI chains act as charge carriers that determine the conductivity along the chain. From Fig. 5a, the electrical conductivity is only produced by flowing polarons along the chain. Here, the low electrical conductivity in the case of small β is due to the high activation energy for polaron transfer between polymer chains (Fig. 5a), thus, electrons cannot flow freely among the chains through the side-to-side interaction. However, when β is optimum, the electrical conductivity not only depends on flowing polarons along the chain but also on the electrons that can flow among the chains because the activation energy is very low (Fig. 5b). It describes the optimum β that contributes to increasing the electrical conductivity by side-to-side interchain interaction. However, when the interchain distance of PANI-ES becomes too close due to the high β, the interaction between polarons and benzenoid/quinonoid rings will significantly increase. Under this condition, the polarons are then stabilized and spread over a large potential well (Fig. 5c).46 The new orientation of PANI-ES forms interchain interactions between N˙+ (polarons) and benzenoid/quinonoid units, which then trapped the polarons. Moreover, the high β also increases the chain bending, which is unfavourable for the polaron transfer along the PANI-ES chain. Both conditions hinder the electrons from flowing along the chain, thus lowering the electrical conductivity of PANI-ES.
 Fig. 5  Schematic of various side-to-side interchain interactions in PANI-ES (I). Potential of PANI-ES along the chain (II) and among the interchain (III) at different β. The blue arrow describes free electrons transported along the chain, while the green arrow describes free-polarons among the chain. Dashed lines represent the potential of N˙+ (polaron) that combines with B (benzenoid)/Q (quinonoid) potential, and it becomes spread potential. (a) At small β, as the distance of the side-to-side interchain becomes large, the electron is difficult to transport among the chains because of the minimum overlap area and the height of activation energy. (b) At optimum β, the electrical conductivity not only depends on the free-polaron along the chain but is also supported by flowing electrons among the chains due to the low activation energy. (c) At larger β, PANI-ES chains bend significantly, increasing the potential between benzenoid/quinonoid rings along the polymer chain. Benzenoid/quinonoid rings among the chains create stronger interactions that stabilize polarons in a large potential well (red shaded area), thus, electrons only move around in a large potential well among the chain, decreasing the electrical conductivity. 
From the analysis results, the optimum values of d{(110)} and β are required, thus, electrons can flow and result in electrical conductivity. Therefore, it can be explained by plotted data in Fig. 6. It shows a relation of β and d{(110)} as a function of temperature and electrical conductivity. The optimum electrical conductivity of PANI-ES will be attained if these crystalline phase structures have d{(110)} and β in their confidence bands, respectively. Let us see, PANI-ES synthesized at −15 °C results in higher conductivity because both d{(110)} and β are in their confidence bands. On the other hand, when only d{(110)} or β is in its specific band of confidence, it results in a significant decrease in electrical conductivity. Those conditions were attained by PANI-ES synthesized at −10 to 15 °C. Synthesized PANI-ES shows the lowest conductivity when both d{(110)} and β are not in their confidence bands as PANI-ES synthesized at 25 °C. Thus, we can conclude that optimum d{(110)} and β must be attained inside the bands of confidence to produce PANI-ES with high electrical conductivity.

The highest electrical conductivity of synthesized PANI-ES at −15 °C is supported by macroscopic morphology analysis using SEM. It shows the presence of granules that are interconnected by the PANI-ES nanofibers networks (Fig. 7). The intermingled structure among granules and nanofibers of PANI-ES will facilitate conductivity at a macroscopic scale as reported previously,9,51 where the contribution of both amorphous (granules) and crystalline (fibers) parts of PANI networks is essential to attain high conductivity.

We also confirmed that the type of synthesized PANI at different temperatures using FT-IR analysis is a PANI-ES. The FT-IR spectrum of PANI-ES is presented in Fig. 8a. The characteristics of PANI-ES are reflected by the presence of a peak at 700–800 cm−1, which shows in-plane C–H bending and also the presence of a substituted benzene ring at para position (1,4-disubstituted benzene). The strong absorption peak at 1120 cm−1 indicates vibrations of –NH+, QNH+–B, or B–NH+˙–B structures where Q is the quinonoid unit, and B is the benzenoid unit.52 This peak also indicates the presence of positively charged moieties in the chain and the distribution of dihedral angles between Q and B rings. This is correlated with the electron delocalization in the PANI structure and also the presence of a strong hydrogen bond –NH+–…N– among chains. In other words, this band reflects the presence of doped PANI in a conductive ES form. The moderate peak at 1242 cm−1 corresponds to C–N+˙ stretching in Q–B–Q, Q–B–B, and B–B–Q structures.53 The absorption band at 1300 cm−1 is due to the delocalization of π electrons in protonated PANI.54 Both peaks at 1249 and 1305 cm−1 indicate the presence of free polarons and responsible for the highest conductivity of synthesized PANI. It also confirmed that the suggested interaction (face-to-face and side-to-side) is likely to occur. Peaks at 1488 and 1560 cm−1 reflect the characteristics of CN and CC stretching of Q–B rings, respectively. A broad absorption band typical of the conducting form of PANI can be observed at wavenumbers higher than 2000 cm−1.55,56 The absence of an absorption peak at 2200 cm−1 ensures that the synthesized PANI samples include PANI-ES.1 Several moderate peaks at 2850–3215 cm−1 correspond to aromatic C–H stretching.57,58 Weak and broad bands at 3300 cm−1 indicate N–H stretching in secondary amine. The PANI-ES sample is also bound with water, shown by the presence of an absorption band centered at 3400 cm−1.

Fig. 8b presents the Raman spectra of PANI-ES synthesized at different temperatures, which show several peaks representing some characteristics of PANI-ES. Peaks at 513 and 516 cm−1 correspond to the out-of-plane C–N–C torsion (bipolaronic structure) and amine in-plane deformation (polaronic structure), respectively.59 Intense bands at 575, 1390, and 1645 cm−1 are assigned to the phenazine-like structure.60,61 Small and moderate peaks at 725 and 806 cm−1 correspond to imine (C–NC bending) and amine (C–N–C bending) deformation. The intense single peak at 1168 cm−1 is the characteristic of C–H bending in emeraldine (9a) species.62 The presence of polaron species is confirmed by the occurrence of a peak at 1327 cm−1, which correlates to C–N˙+ stretching. The peak at 1380 cm−1 attributed to the C–N stretching vibrations appeared in the neighborhood of a quinonoid ring.63 A moderate peak at 1508 cm−1 is assigned to N–H deformation vibrations associated with the semi-quinonoid structure. The peak at 1594 cm−1 and shoulder at 1618 cm−1 correspond to CC stretching in Q and C–C stretching in B.64 By increasing the synthesis temperature, there are some changes in Raman spectra, especially at −5 to 25 °C of the temperature of synthesis cases. First, the peaks at 575 and 1390 cm−1 increase significantly as temperature increases and the intensity of the shoulder decreases at 1618 cm−1, which is followed by the increase of a small peak at 1645 cm−1 in PANI. These phenomena are consistent with the presence of phenazine-like species, which are known as side products in PANI synthesis and considered a defect in PANI macrostructures.65
Phenazine-like units in PANI-ES contribute to the formation of cross-linking among the PANI chains.61 Formation of phenazine-like units during cross-linking is accommodated by a pair of polaronic structures, thus the formation of phenazine segments directly consumes the polaronic structure along the cross-linked PANI-ES chains.60,61 The phenazine-like unit also demonstrates the radical scavenging nature,66 which is in good agreement with the fact that phenazine segments do not stabilize the polarons.67–69 Polarons are stabilized on the linear segments along the PANI-ES chain. Moreover, the presence of a phenazine-like unit indicates the formation of non-conductive oligomers and branched structures that incorporated into PANI-ES.51,70,71 Here, the phenazine-like structure will reduce the linearity of PANI-ES chains, thus increasing their irregularity.51 The phenazine-like unit also reduces the conjugation structure in the PANI chains, thus hindering the electron delocalization along the PANI chain.51,72 The phenazine-like structure is also reported to decrease the molecular weight of synthesized PANI-ES, leading to the decrease in electrical conductivity.73 This finding supports other characterizations’ results and concludes that phenazine species in PANI are also responsible for the decrease in the electrical conductivity of the resulting PANI synthesized at high temperature.

Fig. 9 shows the photovoltaic performance of fabricated DSSCs using synthetic graphite-based counter-electrodes. A significant increase was observed in almost all photovoltaic parameters by applying the electrocatalytic active layers, especially PANI ES, on the synthetic graphite substrate. Here, PANI ES synthesized at 0 °C was used in the form of a graphite–PANI blend. Despite its excellent electrical conductivity, synthetic graphite and even graphite still lack electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of I3− species in the I−/I3− redox couple electrolyte, leading to the low power conversion efficiency (η). The obtained fill factor (FF) for the PANI ES-activated counter-electrode is more than three times higher than other counter-electrodes, indicating that PANI ES has good electrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of I3− species. The FF value represents the electrocatalytic efficiency, notably in the redox couple electrolyte regeneration process in DSSC.74 The PANI ES-activated counter-electrode also demonstrated the highest PCE among others of 2.07% with the short circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.51 mA cm−2 and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) value of 612.5 mV.

The inset shows that the schematic representation of fabricated DSSC consists of a photoanode (PA), an electrolyte (E), and different types of synthetic graphite-based counter-electrodes (CE). The photovoltaic parameters are also presented in the figure. PANI ES synthesized at 0 °C was used as an electrocatalytic active layer in the fabricated DSSC. 
Conclusions
Studies show that the synthesis at low temperature is more favorable to produce PANI-ES with high conductivity. We observed that PANI-ES is produced with different structures at various temperatures that may contribute to their electron transport properties. From the structural analysis based on XRD data using the Le Bail method, we can conclude: (1) a diffraction peak at 20° that corresponds to the diffraction plane d{(100)} describes side-to-side interaction, (2) diffraction peak at 25° corresponds to the diffraction plane d{(110)} which highlights the face-to-face interaction, (3) the diffraction peak at 27° assigned as the diffraction plane d{(111)} tends to create diagonal face-to-face interaction, (4) β contributes to increasing the electrical conductivity trough side-to-side interaction. Low-temperature synthesis leads to a convergent result of the d{(110)} value around 5.3 Å and β around 98.5° in the confidence bands, which can be correlated with a favorable structure for a high conducting PANI-ES. The optimum d{(110)} and β in the bands of confidence describe the ease of electron transport among the chain, determining the electrical conductivity through the face-to-face and the side-to-side interactions, respectively. Based on the analysis of experimental results, the dominant interaction comes from d{(110)} face-to-face interaction. The possibility of the suggested interaction is supported by Raman and FTIR characterization of synthesized PANI-ES powder at different temperatures. Infrared peaks at 1249 cm−1 and 1305 cm−1 indicate the presence of a free polaron that is responsible for the high electrical conductivity of PANI-ES synthesized at −15 °C. The high conductivity of PANI-ES is also supported by its morphology analyzed using SEM. The PANI-ES powder synthesized at −15 °C shows a granulated structure that interconnected with nanofibers, which described the contribution of both amorphous (granules) and crystalline (fibers) parts of PANI networks to achieve a structure that facilitates high electrical conductivity. Moreover, PANI ES synthesized at 0 °C was used as an electrocatalytic active layer in the DSSC's counter-electrode. The PANI ES-activated counter-electrode demonstrated the highest PCE among others of 2.07% with the short circuit current density (Jsc) of 6.51 mA cm−2 and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) value of 612.5 mV.

 	Fig. 1  Both electrical conductivity and total Drude electron density of PANI-ES decrease with polymerization temperature. The total Drude electron density plot was obtained based on the frequency response of conductivity data (Bode plot) using eqn (3) (Fig. S1a, ESI†).

 	Fig. 2  Amorphous content of the synthesized PANI-ES as a function of polymerization temperature. The inset shows how the amorphous contents were determined by fitting the XRD pattern using a log-normal probability density function.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Profiles of powder X-ray diffraction patterns of PANI-ES synthesized at various reaction temperatures, (b) the value of d{(110)} as a function of polymerization temperature (the inset shows the projection along the c-axis of a monoclinic unit cell), (c) the side view along the b-axis, and (d) the side view along the a-axis of a monoclinic unit cell proposed by Pouget.37 The inset in (b) highlights the face-to-face interaction between adjacent phenyl rings, which is quantified by d-spacing d{(110)} in a PANI-ES monoclinic unit cell (green shaded area).	 
	(4)

 	Fig. 4  Schematic of PANI-ES interchain potential at various face-to-face interchain distance d{(110)}. (a) At large separation, the distance of face-to-face interchain (d{(110)}) is large, thus, the electron is difficult to be transported between potentials due to a minimum overlap region of π orbitals that leads to a high activation energy. (b) At optimum separation, the electron can flow to another potential with low activation energy when d{(110)} is optimum (optimum overlap π–π stacking). (c) At very close separation, the overlap region becomes very large and creates a spread delocalized environment for polarons, thus, electrons can move around in a large potential well. Moreover, the considerable overlap can also create localized excited states that can trap electrons. Therefore, crystallites with optimum d{(110)} are required to produce PANI-ES with high electrical conductivity.	 

 	Fig. 5  Schematic of various side-to-side interchain interactions in PANI-ES (I). Potential of PANI-ES along the chain (II) and among the interchain (III) at different β. The blue arrow describes free electrons transported along the chain, while the green arrow describes free-polarons among the chain. Dashed lines represent the potential of N˙+ (polaron) that combines with B (benzenoid)/Q (quinonoid) potential, and it becomes spread potential. (a) At small β, as the distance of the side-to-side interchain becomes large, the electron is difficult to transport among the chains because of the minimum overlap area and the height of activation energy. (b) At optimum β, the electrical conductivity not only depends on the free-polaron along the chain but is also supported by flowing electrons among the chains due to the low activation energy. (c) At larger β, PANI-ES chains bend significantly, increasing the potential between benzenoid/quinonoid rings along the polymer chain. Benzenoid/quinonoid rings among the chains create stronger interactions that stabilize polarons in a large potential well (red shaded area), thus, electrons only move around in a large potential well among the chain, decreasing the electrical conductivity.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) The relation of d{(110)} and β as a function of temperature, and (b) d{(110)} and β as a function of electrical conductivity. The shaded areas show a confidence band of d{(110)} and β that play a role in electrical conductivity.
