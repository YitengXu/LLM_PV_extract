    , Accepted 30th September 2015First published on 1st October 2015AbstractCurrently, chlorine (Cl)-incorporated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have triggered a strong interest due to their excellent crystallinity and charge transport property. Herein, we present a facile MaCl-assisted (Ma = CH3NH3) sequential tubular chemical vapor deposition (STCVD) method to fabricate perovskite films, and report for the first time novel Cl-conducted defect repairment and seed crystal-mediated vapor growth behavior. Further studies indicate that Cl has an ultra-strong reaction capacity and special grain refining ability, and these unique features can effectively heal the inherent ditch defects on PbI2 templates and overcome the blocking issue of incomplete conversion in perovskites. With the aid of Cl, the well-defined MaPbI3−xClx small seed crystals are obtained and then grow up into compact, crack-free, and highly uniform MaPbI3 layers with large grain size up to the microscale. Accordingly, the big open-circuit voltage (Voc) exceeding 1.0 V and high efficiency of 13.76% of our STCVD-processed PSCs measured without aperture mask are successfully achieved in this work. Strikingly, our perovskite device without encapsulation still has an efficiency of 4.15% even after exposure to the ambient conditions for 1152 hour. Overall, we propose a viable strategy to realize the controllable preparation of PSCs, and also disclose the exact role of Cl in film morphology evolution during the gas–solid (G–S) growth process.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, development of the photovoltaic industry has been widely adopted as one of the best solutions to relieve the global energy crisis.1,2 However, both the 1st and 2nd generation photovoltaic devices (PVs), such as the dominating crystalline silicon, CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) and CdTe thin-film solar cells, are still facing the challenges of cost reduction and process simplification.3,4 Therefore, there is an urgent demand for fabricating cost-efficient solar cells through the development of new material systems. Recently, the magic organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite family with a general formula MaPbX3 (where Ma is the CH3NH3, and X is the halogen I, Br or Cl) has attracted much attention due to its high absorption coefficient, suitable direct band gap, excellent charge transport property, and high defect tolerance, which shows its potential as a cost-efficient alternative to traditional solar cells.5–9 Based on this newcomer's outstanding optical–electric properties, substantial efforts have been devoted to the development of advanced manufacturing technologies for high performance PVs. Within the last several years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has soared from 3.8% to 20.2%, which is deemed to be one of the major breakthroughs in PV history.10–17 However, the controllable preparation of PSCs is still a critical challenge at the current stage. It is very crucial for its morphology control since the PV performance is highly related to the film quality and crystal structure of perovskite materials, especially in the prevailing planar heterojunction configuration that encourages more homogeneous crystallization for high-efficiency solar cells.18–21 Thus deeply exploring and understanding the strong correlation between the film morphology evolution and its growth process is essential to achieve high-quality perovksite layers for further device performance enhancement.
In recent years, Cl-incorporated perovskites with excellent crystallinity and charge transport property have triggered a strong interest in PSCs field.22–26 In 2013, Snaith first reported that Cl incorporation can significantly increase the electron–hole diffusion length of MaPbI3 films.23 Subsequently, comprehensive morphological studies have been undertaken to elucidate the role of Cl, which is initially considered to have an immensely beneficial effect on the nucleation and crystallization of perovskites in the most studied solution process.27–31 However, it is difficult to precisely control the film morphology as well as Cl incorporation in the uncontrolled liquid-phase growth process, where some unsolved problems often lead to poor reproducibility and large variation in the device performance, such as the complex solution rheology, the incomplete conversion with a poor coverage, and the huge loss of volatile chloride during the extended annealing process.32–36 On the contrary, high-quality perovskite films with Cl inclusion are readily achieved by a vacuum evaporation route. Nonetheless, vacuum based technology requires investment in expensive equipment and also has a high energy consumption, which would hinder its future commercial applications.37,38
Lately, the G–S crystallization process, vapor-assisted solution process (VASP), hybrid CVD, low-pressure CVD, and in situ CVD, have been consecutively developed by other researchers and our group, in which the slow G–S reaction could effectively retard the over-rapid intercalating reaction rate between inorganic frameworks and organic species, and avoid the generation of rough and porous perovskite films.34,39–43 Although vapor-assisted approaches have been considered as fruitful methods for the fabrication of perovskites, the problem of their lengthy duration time (even exceeding 4 hours) arising from the nature of slow G–S reaction should be addressed to fulfill the complete conversion from inorganic templates to perovskites.39 Meanwhile, small grains, apparent voids and cracks inevitably observed in MaPbI3 layers by common vapor-assisted CVD method significantly increase the charge recombination and result in a relatively low Voc of 0.85–0.95 V, which should be attributed to the inherent ditch defects on PbI2 templates and this issue will be discussed below.39–42 Therefore, there is still a lack of a proper strategy to produce crack-free perovskite films and realize their controllable preparation by a CVD approach. Meanwhile, admitting that the beneficial function of Cl is extensively studied in the solution process, thus far, Cl has not been introduced into the vapor-assisted CVD approach, and the function of Cl in film morphology evolution remains as of yet unclear.
In this work, a novel MaCl-assisted two-step STCVD method is developed to fabricate perovskite films, and the open question about the exact role of Cl during the G–S growth process is first disclosed. Without the need of a glove box or expensive vacuum instrument, a cost-efficient tubular CVD furnace was employed here, which could be readily scaled up for commercial mass production. Based on this facile STCVD process, Cl was skillfully introduced into MaPbI3 perovskites during the vapor-assisted growth process. More importantly, it was found that Cl has an ultra-strong reaction capacity and a special grain refining ability, which may effectively repair the inherent ditch defect on PbI2 templates and further fulfill the complete conversion. With the assistance of Cl, crack-free and highly uniform perovskite layers with ultra-large grains were obtained. As such, the charge recombination in grain boundaries (GBs) was tremendously reduced and the PV performance was significantly enhanced. Comparing with common CVD, the device Vocvia STCVD was boosted from 0.915 V to 1.001 V, with an impressive enhancement of 86 mV. And the best efficiency tested without aperture mask was also greatly improved from 10.29% to 13.76%, demonstrating a high efficiency among CVD processed PSCs. Notably, the as-prepared device without encapsulation exhibited a good stability in an air environment. Therefore, the desired controllable fabrication procedure for efficient and stable PSCs has been elucidated in this work, and our research sheds light on understanding the exact role of Cl in the G–S growth process of perovskite layers.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Reaction ability of MaCl with PbI2 templates
In order to reveal the function of Cl during the G–S growth process, the intercalating reaction and its crystal structure evolution are investigated here through comparing the reaction abilities of MaI and MaCl with PbI2 templates at different reaction stages. Fig. 1 shows the (a and b) photographs, (c and d) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, and (e and f) UV-vis spectra of PbI2 films reacted with MaI at 145 °C and MaCl at 120 °C for different duration times: 0 min, 5 min, 15 min, and 35 min. Yu et al. have demonstrated that MaCl is much easier to turn into gaseous phase as compared to MaI.35 So due to the different sublimation temperatures, we separately set reaction temperatures of MaI at 145 °C and MaCl at 120 °C. In the case of MaI, even at higher temperature, the intercalating reaction rate between MaI and PbI2 templates is quite slow, as can be seen from the color change in Fig. 1(a). When the reaction proceeds for 5 min, there is no crystal structural evolution as can be seen from XRD in Fig. 1(c). The onset of the UV-vis absorbance spectrum (Fig. 1(e), red line) is also located at the same position with that of PbI2. Only when it reacts for 15 min, tetragonal MaPbI3 perovskite phase is observed from XRD, showing peaks at 14.01°, 28.19°, 31.59°, and 43.09°, separately assigned as (110), (220), (310) and (330) planes.8,22,26 Even then, we could clearly notice the presence of PbI2 reflections at 12.61°, which means the structural conversion from PbI2 to MaPbI3 is not complete.8,35,44 That said, a rather long duration time is necessary to fulfill the complete transformation via the kinetically unfavorable van der Waals gap.41,45 Our results in the MaI case are consistent with Yang's observations, in which it even takes 2–4 hours to complete this conversion through the VASP approach.39
 Fig. 1  (a and b) Photographs, (c and d) XRD patterns, and (e and f) UV-vis spectra of PbI2 films reacted with MaI at 145 °C and MaCl at 120 °C for different duration times: 0 min, 5 min, 15 min, and 35 min. 
On the contrary, from Fig. 1(b, d and f), we can see that MaCl is able to quickly react with PbI2 even at a lower temperature of 120 °C. After being reacted for only 5 min, MaPbI3−xClx perovskite structure has been formed rapidly, and no signals of PbI2 are observed from XRD (Fig. 1(d), red line), and there is also a huge redshift visible in UV-vis spectra, which implies that complete conversion has been accomplished in such a short time. Here we infer that the fast reaction feature presumably comes from the ultra-strong penetrating power of Cl, and its small atomic radius facilitates the diffusion into PbI2 layered structure during G–S intercalating reaction process.41 Note that the duration time in MaCl is a vital factor for the following seed crystal-assisted growth process. When it is increased to 15 min, an interesting phase-splitting phenomenon appears as seen from the random diffractions (blue line) in Fig. 1(d), which should be attributed to the limited miscibility of MaPbI3 and MaPbCl3.27,46 Thus 5 min's duration time in MaCl is very suitable for the growth of MaPbI3−xClx seed crystals. Taken together, it is evident that MaCl has an ultra-strong reaction capacity with PbI2, which could effectively solve the blocking issue and fulfill the complete conversion in perovskites.
2.2 Two-step STCVD reaction process
Based on the strong reaction ability of MaCl, a novel seed crystal-mediated two-step STCVD method is developed here. For comparison, (i) the common CVD route is abbreviated as R1 for ease and clarity and (ii) the seed crystal-mediated STCVD route is denoted as R2 and they are both depicted in Scheme 1. As shown in R1 only using MaI as the vapor source, the slow G–S reaction between PbI2 and MaI directly leads to too long a duration time and incomplete conversion in perovskites.39–42 At the same time, due to the inherent ditch defects on PbI2 templates, as will be shown in the next part, uneven and porous film morphology is inevitably generated through the common CVD. Inversely, when MaCl is initially employed during first-step CVD process, it quickly reacts with PbI2 and produces continuous MaPbI3−xClx seed crystals with complete conversion in terms of its strong reaction ability. In order to produce a large number of seed crystals for the following growth of high-quality perovskite films, we set the evolution time as 5 min just in case they grew too big and would hardly convert back from MaPbCl3 to MaPbI3. As such, well-defined seed films then grow up to be compact MaPbI3 layers under MaI vapor in the second-step CVD process. Since Cl concentration in the final perovskite films is very low (<0.1 at%) and cannot be detected by the prevailing characterizations,24,35,36 it is appropriate to use the formula “MaPbI3” to denote its composition rather than the formula “MaPbI3−xClx”. Hence our novel R2 recipe offers several incomparable advantages: firstly, the current solution process or vacuum evaporation requires complicated manipulations in a glove box or expensive instrument investment, while our method is performed under open-air conditions employing the cost-efficient tubular CVD furnace, which is much more convenient to be applied in future large-scale applications. Secondly, the blocking issue of incomplete conversion in perovskites during solution based technology or common CVD process could be effectively solved by the seed crystal-mediated STCVD method. Finally, all the operations in R2, including coating PbI2 templates, growth of MaPbI3−xClx seed crystals, and deposition of MaPbI3 films, are easily manipulated and well controlled.
 Scheme 1  Schematic growth processes of MaPbI3 films by (i) common CVD and (ii) seed crystal-mediated STCVD. 
Then the crystal structure evolution as well as Cl incorporation in the STCVD process is carefully scrutinized. Fig. 2 shows (a) photographs and (b) crystal formation scheme of as-prepared PbI2, MaPbI3−xClx, and MaPbI3 films by R2. Here yellow PbI2 precursor films are used as the precursor templates, which are then converted to brown MaPbI3−xClx seed films in MaCl vapor, and finally grown up to be dark brown MaPbI3 layers in MaI atmosphere. The corresponding crystal structure evolution is also schematically shown in this picture. Generally, the as-spun PbI2 films possess a hexagonal structure with the space group Pm1(164), and MaPbI3 layers have a perovskite structure with the space group Pbnm(62).41,47,48 During this typical intercalating reaction process, organic species are able to insert the layered PbI2 inorganic templates with ease, and evolve as perovskites. For the case of MaCl, this reaction will proceed rapidly on account of the small radius of Cl, which is in agreement with the above experiments. Mosconi et al. performed periodic density function (DFT) calculations and suggested that Cl atoms are preferentially occupying the apical positions of PbI6 octahedra.30,46 Here we adopt this proposal and present the schematic structural diagram of MaPbI3−xClx seed crystals, in which I atoms (purple color) are partially substituted by Cl atoms (green color) on the apical positions. In fact, the substituted amounts should be limited otherwise they more likely exist in the form of split phases as observed in previous XRD. From both experimental and theoretical viewpoints, it is hard to form continuous MaPbI3−xClx solid phase and this only occurs at a relatively low Cl content according the view of Colella.24

Fig. 3 shows (a) XRD patterns and (b) UV-vis spectra of PbI2 (black line), MaPbI3−xClx (red line) and MaPbI3 (blue line) films by R2, and MaPbI3 films by R1 (dark cyan line). It is clear that both MaPbI3 films by R1 and R2 exhibit identical perovskite crystal lattices with distinctive (110), (220), (310), and (330) diffractions, and also have similar absorption onsets at ∼800 nm wavelength, which is in accordance with related works.22,26,46 Comparing with R1, as shown in Fig. S1,† MaPbI3 films by R2 exhibit stronger diffraction intensity and higher absorbance, which means that our method could achieve high-quality perovskite films. Remarkably, we may confirm that Cl has been incorporated into perovskites from the peak position variations of the preferred (110) orientation. As detected from XRD, the peak positions of MaPbI3 films made by R1 and R2, and MaPbI3−xClx seeds are separately centered at 14.06°, 14.16°, and 14.20°. With the increasing of Cl content, the peaks slightly shift to higher degrees, causing a little lattice distortion and the broadening of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) plane (Fig. S1†), which is in reasonable agreement with other claims.24,26,35 Meanwhile, MaPbI3−xClx shown by the red lines in the plots exhibits a (001) peak at 15.62° and absorbance at 785 nm, which once again attests to the Cl inclusion in perovskites.35,44 To further study the issue of the presence of Cl, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were employed. Fig. 4 shows the (a) overall, (b) Pb4f, and (c) I3d XPS spectra of PbI2 (black line), MaPbI3−xClx (red line) and MaPbI3 (blue line) films by R2, and MaPbI3 films by R1 (dark cyan); (d) Cl2p XPS spectra of MaPbI3−xClx seed crystals and final MaPbI3 films by R2. As can be seen, all the signals of C1s, N1s, Pb4f, Pb4P3/2, I3d are detected. When the phase transformation happens, Pb4f and I3d peaks both shift to the lower banding energy side, in agreement with recent reports.49–51 Notably, the presence of Cl in MaPbI3−xClx seed crystals is strongly verified by the appearance of Cl2p peaks as shown in the bottom portion of Fig. 4(d). Intriguingly, signals of Cl2p shown on the upper portion of this plot are almost impossible to distinguish, suggesting only very low Cl content existed in the final MaPbI3 films, which is consistent with the above discussion and other related reports.24,25,52 So we speculate that the chemical reaction process in R2 might be as follows: PbI2 + MaCl (g) → MaPbI3−xClx(1) MaPbI3−xClx + MaI (g) → MaPbI3 + MaCl (g)↑(2)

2.3 Film morphology evolution
To gain further insight into the inner reaction process, the film morphology evolution at different reaction stages were also monitored here. Fig. 5 shows the planar scanning electron microscopy (SEM, ×20 K) images of (a) PbI2, (b) MaPbI3−xClx and (c) MaPbI3 films by R2, and (d) MaPbI3 films by R1. The low-magnification (×10 K) SEM pictures are provided in Fig. S2.† Meanwhile, their corresponding 2-D and 3-D atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images are also shown in Fig. S3† and Fig. 6, respectively. In general, PbI2 is selected to prepare precursor films in terms of its relatively high solubility in dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent compared with that of PbCl2.29 Unfortunately, several unsolved problems exist in the PbI2 system, such as large amounts of colloid suspensions, the presence of needle-shaped solvation intermediates, and the over-rapid crystallization nature.32–36 A few fruitful works have confirmed that the poor quality of PbI2 films is the culprit, which usually leads to the uneven and porous MaPbI3 layers with incomplete conversion.33,53 Here from the images of PbI2 films, irregular polyhedron shape grains with different sizes of 100–300 nm are observed on the substrate. It is apparent that PbI2 film surface is crisscrossed by irrigation canals and ditches, as clearly shown in Fig. S4,† which might be caused from the volatilization of DMF during the spin-coating and hot treatment process. Worse yet is that, these inherent ditch defects would seriously destroy the uniformity of the final perovskite films if the as-obtained PbI2 was directly employed as growth templates. Thus it is not strange that the uneven MaPbI3 films by R1 in Fig. 5(d) are composed of many small grains, accompanying with apparent voids and cracks. The poor film quality generally results in a low Voc of 0.85–0.95 V and heavy deterioration of its PV performance.39–42,54,55 Strikingly, from the morphology of MaPbI3−xClx films as shown in Fig. 5(b), we surprisingly find that the inherent canals and ditches on PbI2 templates are successfully repaired by the introduced MaCl vapor. Comparing Fig. 6(a), (b), S3(a) and (b),† it is apparent that PbI2 grains become small and the inherent ditches totally disappear. Thus, through this special grain refining process, closely packed MaPbI3−xClx seed crystals come into being. With the aid of Cl-conducted defect-healing ability, smooth and continuous MaPbI3−xClx seed films with full coverage are obtained, as shown in Fig. 6(b). Then, the well-defined small seeds grow up to be compact, uniform MaPbI3 perovskite layers without any cracks or voids, as observed in Fig. 5(c). From Fig. 5(c) and (d), 6(c) and (d), and S3(c) and (d†),† under the identical reaction temperature and time, perovskite grains from seed-mediated R2 are much larger, denser, and more uniform than that of R1. So our method is able to achieve high-quality perovskite films via a Cl-conducted defect-healing and seed crystal-mediated growth process.

Fig. 7 provides particle size distributions of MaPbI3 films by R2 and R1 based on their SEM images in Fig. 2(c) and (d), respectively. In order to quantitatively show the uniformity of as-prepared perovskite films, herein Nano Measure software is used to analyze the particle size distribution according to a reported method,33 and all the grains in Fig. 2(c) and 90 pieces of grains in Fig. 2(d) are precisely counted. As calculated in the plots, perovskite films by R1 are composed of discretely distributed grains with sizes from 50 nm to 500 nm; while highly crystallized R2 films have a narrow distribution with larger grain sizes around 80% located in the small range of 700–850 nm. As in previous reports, the average grain sizes of MaPbI3 films by vapor-assisted approaches are usually below 500 nm.39,41,42 Here we can see that the grain sizes in R2 grow up to be micron level, which could effectively reduce the charge recombination in GBs and enhance the PV performance. Therefore, it can be concluded that perovskite films from STCVD possess larger grains, narrower distributions, and better uniformities than that of R1, which indicates that closely packed MaPbI3−xClx seed crystals play a crucial role during the G–S growth process. In addition, it is found that almost 45% of I is replaced by Cl in MaPbI3−xClx from SEM-EDS (Fig. S5†). Similarly, the Cl content in the final perovskites is not detectable. This is in accordance with other studies, and we speculate that Cl might volatilize as MaCl gas via the above-deduced reaction process shown in eqns (1) and (2).24,52 In brief, compact, crack-free, and highly uniform MaPbI3 layers with large grains are obtained via the STCVD approach, and the obtained film quality is much better than that obtained by the traditional vapor-assisted method. Importantly, a novel defect repairment and seed crystal-mediated growth behavior is first discovered, and the exact role of Cl in morphological evolution during G–S growth process is also revealed here.

2.4 Device performances of PSCs
The planar PSCs based on MaPbI3 films by common CVD in R1 and our STCVD in R2 are separately fabricated, and their device performances including PCE and stability properties are examined as well. Strikingly, from the low- and high-magnification cross-sectional SEM images of PSCs made by STCVD as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b), we can see that massive crystal grains with a straightforward long-distance uniformity are fully covering the TiO2/FTO/glass substrate. Such high-quality perovskite layers with ultra-large and super-dense grains are extremely rare in solution process or vapor-assisted approaches, which are even comparable with those obtained by a vacuum evaporation method. Bi et al. have illustrated that large-aspect-ratio grains are required in polycrystalline thin-film PVs for the reduction of charge recombination at GBs and the enhancement of PCE.56 Thus, the nearly-flawless high film quality is expected to promote its device performances.
 Fig. 8  (a) Low- and (b) high-magnification SEM images of the R2 device; (c) J–V curves inserted with device photographs and (d) EQE spectra of R1 and R2 PSCs; (e) J–V curves of R2 PSCs stored under ambient conditions over different times: 0 hour, 288 hour, 576 hour, 864 hour, and 1152 hour, giving efficiencies of 13.76%, 8.72%, 6.35%, 4.58%, and 4.15%, respectively. 
Then, we compare their device PV performances of PSCs by R1 and R2 measured without an aperture mask as listed in Table 1. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d), respectively. Generally, PSCs by vapor-assisted method usually have a relatively low Voc around 0.9 V.39–42 Thus solar cells made by R1 only give a low mean efficiency of 8.39% with a Voc of 0.915 V, short current density (Jsc) of 16.62 mA cm−2, and filling factor (FF) of 55.68. The best efficiency produced by R1 is only just 10.29%. In contrast, an average efficiency of PSCs made by R2 greatly increases to 11.52% (Voc: 0.942 V; Jsc: 18.80 mA cm−2; FF: 58.10), increased by almost 40% compared with that of by R1. Notably, owning to the large and crack-free grains in R2, Voc is greatly improved from 0.915 V to 1.001 V, with an enhancement of 86 mV. Our champion cells provide a high efficiency of 13.76% (Voc: 1.005 V; Jsc: 21.94 mA cm−2; FF: 62.40), with a big Voc exceeding 1.0 V and Jsc approaching 22 mA cm−2. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the highest PCE reports by CVD approaches so far. Simultaneously, PSCs produced by R2 have higher EQE values over the whole visible spectral range than those produced by R1, leading to the great enhancement of Jsc, which must benefit from the higher film quality. In addition, the reverse and forward scan J–V characteristics are also examined to investigate the hysteresis effect, which is reported to be prominent in the planar structural PSCs.57 So we selected a representative cell to test this effect. As shown in Fig. S6,† the PSCs in the reverse scan give a PCE of 12.29% with Jsc of 20.16 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.002 V, and FF of 60.84%, and PSCs in the forward scan show a PCE of 9.67% with Jsc of 20.25 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.019 V, and FF of 46.86%. Thus it still exhibits a hysteresis phenomenon, which might be relieved through the efficient charge extraction via further morphological and structural optimization.

Finally, the device stability of the as-fabricated PSCs is examined. Basically, an efficient perovskite device should meet the requirement for stability before it can be really applied in outdoor environments. In terms of the fast degradation nature of PSCs in most solution process cases, however, limited studies are focused on this important issue.58–60 As shown in Fig. 8(e), the stability of our R2 PSCs without encapsulation stored under dark in ambient air over different times is tested. Surprisingly, they still have an efficiency of 4.15% even undergoing upon exposure to the ambient conditions for 1152 hour. Fig. 9 shows the stability of eight PSCs reserved in air with different days: 0 hours (0 days), 288 hours (12 days), 576 hours (24 days), 864 hours (36 days), and 1152 hours (48 days), respectively. It can be observed that Voc and Jsc only decline a little; only FF drops drastically, which might be caused by the hygroscopicity of the spiro-MeOTAD hole-transporting layer. Conversely, a device made by R1 deteriorates very fast, and only can be stored for several days. After exposure for 48 days, as can be seen in Fig. S7(a and b†), it is obvious that device made by R1 is totally destroyed, while there is no apparent change in the appearance of the R2 cells. This is because the compact perovskite structure in our PSCs is hard to be decomposed by the moisture in air, thus it exhibits a good stability feature.

3. Conclusions
In summary, a novel Cl-incorporated STCVD method has been developed to realize the controllable preparation of PSCs, and the Cl-conducted defect-healing and seed crystal-assisted growth phenomenon is first reported here. We find that Cl has an ultra-strong reaction capacity with PbI2 and also possesses a special grain refining ability, which could effectively heal the inherent ditch defects on PbI2 templates, and generate continuous MaPbI3−xClx seed films with complete conversion. With the aid of seed crystals, super-dense, crack-free, and highly uniform MaPbI3 layers with micron-level large grains are obtained. As a consequence, the device PV performance via STCVD is significantly enhanced in comparison with that obtained by the common CVD. Accordingly, the device Voc is boosted from 0.915 V to 1.001 V, with an impressive enhancement of 86 mV; and the best efficiency is greatly improved from 10.29% to 13.76%, demonstrating a high efficiency among CVD processed PSCs. Therefore, our proprietary STCVD method possessing low cost, high efficiency, and stable feature, shows high potential to be applied in the commercial production of PSCs. Meanwhile, our research also provides a new insight on the function of Cl during the G–S growth process of perovskite materials.
4. Experimental
4.1 Materials
All materials were purchased from Aladdin, unless otherwise specified, and they were used as received. Spiro-MeOTAD was a Derthon product and FTO glasses of 2.2 mm thickness and 15 Ω square−1 were purchased from Pilkington.
4.2 MaI and MaCl synthesis
MaI and MaCl were prepared according to previous reports.41 MaI was synthesized by reacting methylamine (33 wt% ethanol solution) and hydroiodic acid (45 wt% in water) with the molar ratio of 1.2:1 in an ice-bath with continuous stirring. Then the precipitate was washed with diethyl ether three times and finally dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 hour. MaCl was synthesized using hydrochloride acid (37 wt% in water) with the same molar ratio and synthesizing conditions of MaI.
4.3 Fabrication of PSCs
Firstly, TiO2 compact layers were obtained by spin-coating a mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol at 2000 rpm for 60 s, which were then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min, and treated in 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 65 °C for 30 min, followed by drying at 500 °C for another 30 min. Secondly, PbI2 powder was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with a concentration of 400 mg mL−1. PbI2 films were coated by spin-coating the as-synthesized solution on TiO2/FTO/glass substrate at a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s. Thirdly, PbI2 films were placed into the tubular quartz furnace. In route i (R1), PbI2 was directly reacted with MaI at 145 °C for 100 min; while in route ii (R2), it was first reacted with MaCl at 120 °C for 5 min, and then reacted with MaI at 145 °C for 100 min. After the reaction, MaPbI3 films were taken out and washed with isopropanol, following annealing at 145 °C for 30 min in air. Finally, a hole-transporting layer was deposited by spin coating with a speed of 4000 rpm for 30 s. And the solution was synthesized by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-MeOTAD, 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide solution (520 mg LITSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile) and 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine in 1 mL chlorobenzene. Then a silver electrode was evaporated by thermal vacuum evaporation at 10−6 bar with a stainless steel mask (active area: 0.12 cm2). All the experiments were carried out under fully open-air conditions with humidity around 40%.
4.4 Characterizations
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Sol3A 94023A) with a source meter (Keithley 2400) under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G) and tested without aperture mask. The step voltage was fixed at 10 mV and the active area of single cells is 0.12 cm2. EQE was measured with a Newport QE measurement kit (IQE-200) by focusing a monochromatic beam of light onto the devices. The crystal structures of the perovskite films were measured by X-ray diffraction (D/MAX 2500V). The morphology and composition were separately observed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Sirion 200), atomic force microscope (AFM, Dimension FastScan), and SEM-EDS. The absorption spectrum was recorded by UV-visible spectrophotometer (CARY 5000) with the wavelength range of 300–1000 nm. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured with an ESCALAB 250 instrument.
