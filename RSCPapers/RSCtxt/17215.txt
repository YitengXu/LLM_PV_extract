    , Accepted 20th October 2021First published on 30th October 2021AbstractTo develop cosensitizers for fabricating dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on porphyrin dyes, C2 and C3 have been synthesized using a diphenylamine donor, an anthracene based π-spacer and a benzoic acid acceptor on the basis of our previously reported cosensitizer C1. Thus, two hexyloxy chains have been introduced in the diphenylamine donor to synthesize C2 with the purpose of extending the absorption wavelength range and suppressing the charge recombination, and C3 has been synthesized by introducing two bulky 2,4-bis(hexyloxy)phenyl groups in the diphenylamine donor to effectively suppress dye aggregation and charge recombination between the injected electrons and the electrolyte. On this basis, DSSCs have been fabricated by using C1–C3 based on the cobalt electrolyte. As expected, an obviously higher Jsc of 13.03 mA cm−2 has been obtained for C2 relative to that of 11.92 mA cm−2 obtained for C1. As a result, C2 shows a slightly improved efficiency of 7.59%. On the other hand, the molecular structure of C3 has been further optimized with two bulky dihexyloxyphenyl units, and thus the suppressed interfacial back electron transfer improves the Jsc to 13.23 mA cm−2 and the superior anti-aggregation ability enhances the Voc to 857 mV. Finally, the highest PCE value of 8.95% is achieved for C3. On this basis, cosensitization with XW66 affords remarkable efficiencies of 9.06%, 9.89% and 10.22% for C1–C3, respectively. These results provide an effective approach for developing efficient cosensitizers for porphyrins by introducing suitable substituents into the donor unit.
Introduction
The increasing global energy demand and environmental pollution problems have inspired scientists to explore renewable sources of energy. Among them, solar energy is the most abundant source of alternative, clean and pollution-free energy. Since the initial work in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been extensively explored owing to their relatively low cost, easy fabrication, good flexibility and high efficiency.1–4
To date, excellent dyes mainly include ruthenium complex sensitizers,5,6 metal-free organic dyes7–9 and porphyrin dyes.10–17 Among them, porphyrin-based donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) dyes have been demonstrated to be efficient due to their excellent light-harvesting ability and easy structure modulation, and thus a number of porphyrin dyes with high performance have been developed.18–21 Despite the successful examples, porphyrin sensitizers have obvious weak absorption within the wavelength ranges of 500–600 nm and 350–410 nm, which hampers the further improvement of the efficiencies.22–25 On the other hand, good planarity of a large conjugated framework leads to severe dye aggregation and π⋯π stacking on the TiO2 surface, which will quench the excited dyes and thus diminish electron injection.26–28 To address these problems, cosensitizers with complementary absorption characters have been designed for improving light harvesting by filling up the absorption valleys of the porphyrin dyes. Meanwhile, the cosensitizers are also effective in suppressing the dye aggregation for further improving the photovoltaic performance of porphyrin based DSSCs.29–31 In this respect, we have reported various porphyrin dyes and their corresponding cosensitizers, such as XW4 and C1,14XW11 and WS-5,13XW40 and Z111 using the I−/I3− redox couple as the electrolyte.
Very recently, we reported efficient DSSCs based on XW66 and WS-5 using a cobalt electrolyte.25 However, only a low photocurrent density (Jsc) of 8.97 mA cm−2 was obtained for WS-5, which may be ascribed to the relatively low molar absorption coefficients and the reduced charge collection efficiency resulting from the faster interfacial charge recombination in the cobalt-based redox electrolyte.16 To address this problem, it may be feasible to develop organic dyes with higher molar absorption coefficients and more flexible substituents as the cosensitizers. In this respect, we have reported an anthracene-based C1 utilizing a diphenylamine donor, which exhibits higher molar absorption coefficients within 350–600 nm relative to WS-5.25 Thus, further modification of C1 may be effective for designing efficient cosensitizers with higher Jsc. Based on this consideration, we herein report novel dyes C2 and C3 as cosensitizers for porphyrins by introducing bulky substituents in the diphenylamine unit of C1 (Fig. 1). Compared with C1, the two hexyloxy chains introduced in the donor could effectively broaden the absorption, as well as hamper the adverse charge recombination process. Thus, an obviously higher Jsc of 13.03 mA cm−2 has been obtained for C2 relative to that of 11.92 mA cm−2 obtained for C1. As a result, C2 shows an improved efficiency of 7.59%. On this basis, C3 has been synthesized by introducing two bulky dihexyloxyphenyl groups in the donor aiming to improve the photovoltage (Voc), reducing the charge recombination between injected electrons and Co3+ ions or cations at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. As expected, C3 affords an improved Voc of 857 mV relative to that of 843 mV obtained for C1. Meanwhile, the branched structure of C3 is favorable for suppressing the interfacial back electron transfer and thus increases the Jsc to 13.23 mA cm−2. As a result, the highest PCE value of 8.95% is achieved for C3, which is strikingly higher than those of 7.46% for C1 and 5.02% for WS-5. Then, C1–C3 were used as cosensitizers along with the porphyrin sensitizer XW6625 to enhance the photocurrents by filling up the light absorption valleys of porphyrin dyes. As a result, the cells cosensitized with C3 and XW66 successfully afforded a remarkable efficiency of 10.22%. These results provide an effective strategy for designing efficient cosensitizers for porphyrin dyes.

Results and discussion
Syntheses of the organic dyes
The synthetic routes for organic dyes C1–C3 are depicted in Scheme 1. C1 was obtained according to our previous approach.14 For C2 and C3, the substituted diphenylamine moieties were synthesized according to the reported procedures,25,32 which were then reacted with 9-bromoanthracene via Buchwald coupling reactions to afford the anthracene-based intermediates. The subsequent bromination and Sonogashira coupling reactions resulted in the ester derivatives of the dyes. Finally, C2 and C3 were achieved after hydrolysis of the esters under basic conditions.

Yields: 30% for 3a; 23% for 3b; and (iii) (a) methyl 4-ethynylbenzoate, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, CuI, Et3N, THF; (b) LiOH·H2O, THF/H2O. Yields: 72% for C2; 33% for C3. 
Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of C1–C3 in THF are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectra of C1–C3 show two absorption bands in the wavelength ranges of 350–450 nm and 450–600 nm assignable to the π–π* transition and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) bands, respectively. The ICT band observed for C2 at 506 nm is red-shifted by ca. 11 nm relative to that of C1 (495 nm), which may be ascribed to the presence of two electron-donating hexyloxy chains on the diphenylamine donor.33,34 Compared with C2, the corresponding absorption peak of C3 appears at 496 nm, which is only slightly red-shifted relative to that of C1, which may be ascribed to the lower electron-donating effect of the dihexyloxyphenyl groups in C3 induced by the severe distortion between the directly linked phenyl moieties.35,36 It is noteworthy that the molar absorption coefficients in 350–435 nm obtained for C1–C3 are significantly higher than that of WS-5,25 indicating that C1–C3 may afford higher Jsc values than that of WS-5. When the dyes are adsorbed onto the TiO2 film, the absorption peaks show blue shifts (Fig. S2, ESI†) as compared to those in the solutions, which may be ascribed to the H-aggregation of the dyes or the deprotonation of the carboxylic moiety accompanied by the adsorption onto the TiO2 surface.37,38 Despite the blue shifts, the broadened absorption peaks are beneficial for improving the light-harvesting ability.36

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of charge injection and dye regeneration for C1–C3 (Fig. S3, ESI†), which play a crucial role in realizing the photovoltaic behavior of DSSCs.
As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the estimated ground-state oxidation potentials (EOX) were found to be 0.79, 0.79 and 0.94 V for C1 to C3versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively, corresponding to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (Fig. 3). It could be found that the HOMO levels of C1–C3 are obviously more positive than the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple (∼0.56 V vs. NHE), indicating that the oxidized dyes can be efficiently regenerated by the electrolyte.39 Moreover, C3 exhibits a more positive HOMO level than those of other dyes, resulting in more efficient charge regeneration due to the larger energy gap.36 The band gaps E0–0 of C1–C3 were calculated to be 2.18 eV for C1 and C2, and 2.24 eV for C3, respectively. The excited-state oxidation potentials , calculated from EOX − E0–0, lie in the range of −1.30 to −1.39 V, considerably more negative than the conduction band edge (CB) of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE), indicative of efficient electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band from the excited sensitizers.40 With enough driving forces for both charge injection and dye regeneration, C1–C3 are expected to perform well in DSSCs based on the cobalt electrolyte.

Theoretical calculations
To obtain further insight into the electron distribution for C1–C3, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations have been performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level using the Gaussian 09 program package.41–44 Thus, the molecular orbital profiles of C1–C3 are shown in Fig. 4. The simulated ELUMO and EHOMO levels of the dyes (Table S2, ESI†) are consistent with the experimental values. According to the optimized structures, the HOMO levels of all the dyes are located on the electron donor units and the anthracene moiety, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are mainly located on the anthracene moiety and the electron acceptor unit. The overlapping between the HOMO and LUMO is beneficial for electron injection from the dyes to the TiO2 surface. In addition, the optimized structure of C3 (Fig. S5, ESI†) displays a large dihedral angle of 55.1° between the terminal phenyl moieties and the phenylene moieties in the diphenylamine unit resulting in a much weaker ICT effect relative to C2, which is consistent with the relatively blue-shifted absorption of C3 (vide supra).

Photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs
Based on the aforementioned results, DSSC devices were fabricated using C1–C3 as the sensitizers and a cobalt electrolyte. The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves and monochromatic incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs are presented in Fig. 5, with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 2.

As shown in Fig. 5, the IPCE spectra of C1–C3 are significantly broadened in the range of 350–635 nm, indicating that all the dyes can efficiently convert visible light into photocurrent. It is obvious that C2 exhibits a red-shifted IPCE onset wavelength of ca. 635 nm relative to that of ca. 618 nm for C1, which may be ascribed to the strengthened ICT effect, resulting from the electron-donating effect of the two hexyloxy chains.15 This observation is beneficial for enhancing the light-harvesting ability and thus generates a higher photocurrent of 13.03 mA cm−2. Moreover, C2 and C3 exhibit IPCE plateaus up to 80% in the range of 350–430 nm and a strikingly higher plateau in 400–635 nm than that of C1. On the other hand, the hexyloxy and bulky groups introduced into C2 and C3 may effectively retard the charge recombination from the cobalt electrolyte and thus enhance the electron-collection yields, resulting in improved Jsc values of 13.03 mA cm−2 and 13.23 mA cm−2,16 respectively, higher than those of 11.92 mA cm−2 for C1 and 8.97 mA cm−2 for WS-5.25 Hence, C2 exhibits a conversion efficiency of 7.59%, which is higher than that of 7.46% for C1. In spite of the identical π-conjugation backbones, the Voc value of 857 mV achieved for C3 is dramatically higher than that of 843 mV obtained for C1, implying that the bulky substituents attached at the donor can efficiently suppress the recombination process for the electrons injected into the TiO2 conduction band and the oxidized species in the electrolyte. Meanwhile, the bulky groups with large steric hindrance may aid in suppressing the harmful π⋯π stacking among the anthracene moieties. As a result, C3 affords the highest efficiency of 8.95%, which is obviously higher than that of 5.02% for WS-5.
Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is usually co-adsorbed onto the surface of TiO2 films as a nonchromophoric coadsorbent to suppress the dye aggregation and improve the photovoltaic behavior of DSSCs.45 Thus, the photovoltaic properties of the DSSCs with co-adsorption of various concentrations of CDCA were investigated (Table S6, ESI†). As expected, the coadsorption of CDCA results in better Voc than the individual dyes for C1 and C2, along with the decreased Jsc values induced by the competitive adsorption of CDCA.22 As a result, the efficiencies for the cells of C1 and C2 are enhanced to 7.52 and 7.84%, respectively, by using 5 mM CDCA. Unfortunately, decreased Jsc and PCE values were observed for C3 when CDCA was applied, in comparison with those of the devices without using CDCA, as a result of reduced dye loading amounts on the TiO2 surface.33 Thus, C1–C3 afforded the PCEs of 7.52–8.95% under the optimized conditions. For comparison, C1–C3 were also used for fabricating solar cells based on the iodine electrolyte (Table S5, ESI†), which afforded lower efficiencies due to the much lower Voc values.31
Considering the relatively high efficiencies obtained for C1–C3, they may be used as promising cosensitizers for porphyrin dyes, and thus they were further used as cosensitizers for the reported porphyrin dye XW66 (Fig. 6 and Table 2).25 As shown in Fig. 2, it is obvious that a series of valleys around 400 nm and 500–600 nm in the absorption spectra of XW66 are well filled up by the contribution of C1–C3. Consistently, broad plateaus are observed in the IPCE spectra within a broad wavelength range of 400–690 nm, dramatically enhanced relative to the individual porphyrin dye XW66.25 As a result, higher Jsc values of 15.03, 16.35 and 16.95 mA cm−2 are achieved for XW66 + C1–C3, respectively. As a result of the strikingly enhanced photocurrents, XW66 + C1–C3 afforded improved PCEs of 9.06%, 9.89% and 10.22%, respectively. It is noteworthy that the highest PCE of 10.22% is much higher than that of 9.23% obtained for XW66 individually.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
To further understand the Voc variation trend of the DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the dark for a series of bias voltages. As is known, when a certain redox electrolyte is used for fabricating the devices, the Voc values of DSSCs are related to the TiO2 conduction band edges (ECB) and the charge recombination processes, which can be revealed by the chemical capacitance (Cμ) and the electron lifetimes (τ), respectively (Fig. 7).46,47 Thus, Cμ and τ values were obtained from electrochemical measurements. As shown in Fig. 7a, it is obvious that C3 exhibits a strikingly lower Cμ value than those of C1 and C2 at a fixed forward bias, which indicates more negative shifts of the ECB for C3, which is favorable for improving the Voc. As a result, the Cμ values in the order of C3 < C1 < C2 are in accordance with the sequence of the decreasing Voc values. On the other hand, the τ values lie in the order of C2 < C1 < C3 (Fig. 7b), indicative of the increasing electron lifetimes and decreasing charge recombination rates, which agree well with the observed increasing Voc values of the DSSC devices. The longest τ values observed for C3 may be ascribed to the superior anti-aggregation ability of the bulky groups and suppression of the charge recombination between the injected electrons and cations at the TiO2/electrolyte interface.48 These observations indicate that the Voc variations of C1–C3 are simultaneously governed by both the TiO2 conduction band edges and the charge recombination processes. After coadsorption with CDCA, the devices based on C1–C3 exhibit obviously decreased Cμ values, indicating an upward shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge, favorable for improving the Voc. Meanwhile, prolonged electron half-lifetimes are observed. It could be inferred that CDCA helps in relieving the aggregation and charge recombination problems for C1–C3. For the cosensitized XW66 + C1–C3 systems, the Cμ variation trend is similar to that observed for the individual dyes C1–C3, which is in accordance with that of the Voc values (Fig. 7c). On the other hand, the cosensitized DSSCs exhibit quite similar τ values, indicative of little influence of the charge recombination processes (Fig. 7d). These results reveal that the Voc values are mainly governed by the variation of the TiO2 conduction band edges after cosensitization.

Conclusions
In summary, with the purpose of developing suitable cosensitizers for porphyrin dyes based on the cobalt electrolyte, novel anthracene dyes C2 and C3 have been designed and synthesized based on our previously reported cosensitizer C1 by modifying the diphenylamine donor with hexyloxy chains and bulky dihexyloxyphenyl moieties, respectively. Thus, the electron-donating hexyloxy chains obviously broaden the absorption spectrum of C2, resulting in an improved Jsc of 13.03 mA cm−2 and a slightly higher PCE of 7.59% than those of C1. On the other hand, the two bulky dihexyloxyphenyl groups on the diphenylamine donor of C3 exhibit superior anti-aggregation ability and retardation of the Co3+/Co2+ ions from approaching the TiO2 surface. As a result, the highest Voc of 857 mV and PCE of 8.95% were obtained for C3. Upon coadsorption with CDCA, the efficiencies of C1 and C2 are improved to 7.52% and 7.84%, respectively. On this basis, C1–C3 were used as cosensitizers for XW66 to afford high efficiencies of 9.06–10.22%. In spite of the relatively high Jsc and PCE obtained for XW66 + C3, this system still exhibits a slightly lower PCE than that of XW66 + WS-5 due to the lower Voc of C3 than that of WS-5, and thus C3 could be further optimized and used as a cosensitizer for porphyrin dyes to achieve better photovoltaic performance in our future work. In one sentence, these results provide an effective approach for developing efficient cosensitizers for porphyrin dyes.
