1 Introduction
Very recently, there has been increasing attention on photocatalytic solar energy conversion via organic transformations in order to develop new environment friendly methodologies for chemical transformations at a lower cost and from renewable resources (water, CO2, N2, etc.).1–3 Regarding photoredox catalysts (PCs) for material conversion,4 concerns have been raised regarding the sustainability of precious metals (ruthenium, palladium, platinum, iridium, etc.) and trace metal (copper, iron, zinc, etc.) contamination, which may impede the use of the resulting materials in optical waveguides, microelectronics and biomaterials, for example.5 Consequently, the development of inexpensive metal-free photocatalysts is of considerable interest. Additionally, due to the variability of organic compounds, the optical and redox properties of metal-free polymeric catalysts can be effectively tuned through molecular design.
To make full use of solar energy as a renewable energy source, significant research endeavours have focused on the exploration of molecular photoelectric devices and photochemical systems for energy conversion. In the construction of solar energy conversion systems with metal-free polymeric semiconductors, a large conjugated structure is a prerequisite of solar light active materials covering the full spectrum of UV-vis to near IR light.6 Polymeric materials that are conjugated are made of large conjugated π-electron systems, and they represent a brand new generation of photocatalysts featuring homogeneity. They display fundamental features of photocatalytic processes, that is, visible light activity, non-toxicity and robustness. Therefore, they are good candidates for renewable resources.7
Graphitic carbon nitride8,9 is a conjugated polymer, and it creates a new hotspot for research, and attracts attention from different disciplines. It can be used as a visible light responsive and metal-free photocatalyst for solar energy conversion and environmental remediation due to its appealing electronic band structure, high physicochemical stability, and earth-abundance. The utilisation of g-C3N4 in heterogeneous catalysis started in 200610 and the first application of g-C3N4 as a metal-free conjugated semiconductor photocatalyst was by Wang in 2009.11 These reports shifted research exploration from hard-to-tune inorganic catalysts to physicochemically-stable polymeric conjugated semiconductor photocatalysts.
However, C3N4 compounds still suffer from insufficient light-absorption and intrinsic charge separation, although many methods including doping, copolymerisation, coordination, covalent modification, non-covalent modification and defect engineering have been developed to solve these shortcomings.12,13 Compared with C3N4 conjugated compounds, other π-conjugated metal-free catalysts have the potential for superior molecular design because the abundance of organic compounds leads to easy modulation of their photophysical and photochemical properties. Therefore, in recent years research into metal-free polymeric catalysts has emerged as a hot topic in photocatalytic chemical conversion. With the significant development of organic photovoltaic applications, the employment of various donor- and acceptor-based molecules with increasingly enhanced performance will provide a variety of options for the development of polymeric metal-free conjugated materials for chemical transformations.
In 2016, Vilela14 summarised the newly reported conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) along with a view to their application as heterogeneous photocatalysts for chemical transformations including hydrogen production, organic synthesis and photopolymerisation. To provide a greater depth and breadth of information, this review presents many more state-of-the-art reports concerning π-conjugated metal-free polymeric semiconductors used for photocatalytic chemical transformations. Beginning with the fundamentals of photocatalysis, we focus on the design principles and construction strategies for metal-free polymeric photocatalysts with large conjugated units as an intriguing platform for the development of various highly efficient and recyclable heterogeneous catalysts in chemical transformations. Additionally, metal-free non-polymeric conjugated catalysts (NPCCs) with a large degree of π-conjugation are also summarised (Table 1). This review also describes a range of potential applications for metal-free polymeric photocatalysts, with special attention paid to water splitting, CO2 and N2 reduction, and organic reactions. Finally, an outlook on the directions in which metal-free photocatalyst research might lead is presented, as well as identification of some issues that remain to be solved.

2 Catalytic mechanisms of π-conjugated metal-free polymeric photocatalysts
Generally speaking, there are two specific catalytic mechanisms, i.e. the semiconductor mechanism and the molecular mechanism, that have been reported to explain the photocatalytic process with metal-free photocatalysts (Fig. 1). As polymeric catalysts are constructed from small molecules or monomers, and the demarcation between metal-free semiconductors and small organic catalysts in photocatalytic reaction systems is non-deterministic, it is of great importance to discuss the two catalytic mechanisms separately herein. Moreover, this discussion will bring valuable inspiration for developing metal-free polymeric photocatalysts.
 Fig. 1  Fundamentals of metal-free polymeric photocatalysts in the semiconductor and molecular mechanisms16–20 (CB, conduction band; VB, valence band; LUMO, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital; HOMO, highest occupied molecular orbital; CT, charge transfer; ET, energy transfer; PT, proton transfer; S1, excited singlet; T1, excited triplet; S0, ground state; Esub, electron potential of the substrates; RA, reactant A and B). 
Basically, the key factors determining the catalytic availability are the excited-state properties of the photocatalyst and the subsequently-generated active species or direct reaction pathways with substrates. The roles of various active species, such as trapped electrons (e−) and holes (h+), superoxide radicals (O2˙−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals (OH˙) and singlet molecular oxygen (1O2), have been reported during catalysis via the semiconductor mechanism. All kinds of techniques, such as transient absorption spectroscopy, the transient-state measurement of the surface photovoltage, and the time-resolved method of microwave conductivity (TRMC), are performed for characterization of the charge separation generated by photons during visible light active catalysis.15 Both computational and theoretical models have been adopted to reveal the electronic density of states and the semiconductor band structure so that we can develop applicable photocatalysts. Because the accuracy is high and the computational costs have been reduced, computational screening with high throughput is used to accelerate the process of discovering photocatalytic reactions.
In the photocatalytic molecular mechanism, the reaction process is dominated by the transfer of energy and electrons from the excited states to the substrate. As far as the transfer of electrons is concerned, reductive and oxidative quenching become possible, and each of them would result in quite different products. As far as the transfer of energy is concerned, under light irradiation, the photocatalyst's excited state returns to the ground state when the deactivation is completed; meanwhile, the transfer of electrons leads to the reduction or oxidation of the photocatalyst. Thus, the key factors in understanding and designing a photocatalyst are to match its excited state (singlet and triplet) and redox properties with the redox potentials of the substrate.
In the photocatalytic semiconductor mechanism, the photocatalysts act as heterogeneous catalysts, while in the molecular mechanism the photocatalysts are homogeneous. The mechanistic bridge that combines the catalytic fundamentals is found in frontier orbital theory. Obviously, it is challenging to understand the link between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, as well as to design and build efficient catalytic systems at the molecular level for metal-free polymeric semiconductors for photocatalysis. Therefore, beyond the detailed discussion of metal-free polymeric semiconductors in this review, the subject of metal-free molecular photocatalysts will also be elaborated on in the Organic reaction section. Metal-free non-polymeric conjugated catalysts are thoroughly summarized to give some direction at the molecular level for designing much more efficient metal-free polymeric semiconductors dedicated to photocatalysis.
3 Design of metal-free polymeric photocatalysts with large π-conjugation
In order to ensure an efficient photocatalytic event, an ideal photocatalyst should exhibit multiple optical, chemical and electrical properties. These include high stability to photocorrosion, a significant overlap of absorption with the sunlight emission spectrum (as a consequence of the bandgap involved), low cost, satisfactory efficiency in charge carrier separation, and a high quantum yield of the photoreaction. But, fundamentally, what will determine the photocatalytic availability and efficiency of a photocatalyst are the intrinsic principles of the electronic and band structures and charge separation. Following the presentation of the design fundamentals, this section discusses different functional units, connecting bonds, and dimensional extensions used in constructing metal-free polymeric semiconductor photocatalysts at the molecular level.
3.1 Modulation of the electronic and band structures
The optical spectrum coverage and catalytic activity of a photocatalyst mainly arise from its electronic and band structures, which also determine its redox properties for chemical transformations. Therefore, it is of great importance in molecular design to pay careful attention to the tuning of the electronic and band structures for specific chemical reactions. One of the effective ways to carry out electronic and band structure modulation is to introduce different donor–acceptor (D–A) or donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) structures within the conjugated backbone.
For organic frameworks (POFs, Fig. 2) which are porous and π-conjugated, a simple method used to adjust their redox potential was developed by Zhang et al.21 The obtained carbazolic copolymers (CzCPs) displayed a wide range of redox potentials due to the special co-monomers of electron donors and acceptors, and they are similar to those of general transition-metal complexes. Co-polymeric semiconductors display high efficiency in the stepwise degradation of lignin β-O-4 models.

Based on the work above, a proper strategy of design for a number of purposeful manipulations of the structure of entirely organic-acceptor photocatalysts that are based on cyanoarene was implemented by Zeitler and co-workers successfully,22 with 1,2,3,5-tetrakis(carbazol-9-yl)-4,6-dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) as the beginning point (Fig. 3). The substituents of the donor and the molecular core of the acceptor are modified systematically, so that the researchers can find strongly reducing and oxidising catalysts (e.g. for an unprecedented detriflation of less activated naphthol triflate). They provided excellently balanced potentials of redox and trends that can be predicted. Specially, the core substitutions of halogen arene are helpful for the specific modification of the catalyst redox properties.

The band structures of certain conjugated polymers could be systematically controlled by modulating their molecular chain length, and were strongly related to their degree of polymerisation (DP; i.e., π-conjugation). This offered an effective strategy for the design of metal-free photocatalysts with tunable band structure and light absorption properties (Fig. 4).23

Another band structure modulation strategy for large π-conjugated materials is to vary the ratio of different donor or acceptor structures. Via copolymerisation of electron-withdrawing benzobisthiadiazole moieties into the polymer network backbone, Zhang et al.24 reported a facile yet precise bandgap engineering strategy for a series of nanoporous polymers (Fig. 5). The well-tuned valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) positions of the polymers could be rationally aligned to bracket the redox potential of targeted individual reactions and drive the photoredox reactions. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the nanoporous polymer networks was demonstrated through the synthesis of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline via photooxidative cyclisation of N,N-dimethylanilines with maleimides.

In addition to the strategies of donor–acceptor selection and arrangement, and π-conjugation degree adjustment, introducing different electron-donating or withdrawing substituents is also an effective way to perturb the electronic structures of frontier orbitals by decreasing or increasing the highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO/LUMO) alignment.25 These methods enable utilisation of the electronic and band structures to regulate the ground-state absorptivity of low optical bandgap π-conjugated polymers and molecules, and can also be exploited as a powerful means to modulate their excited-state relaxation pathways. Finally, the designed metal-free photocatalysts can be adjusted within a wide range to match the redox properties of certain chemical reactions.
3.2 Charge-separation promotion
The charge separation is designed so that the photogenerated carriers can spread spatially, and it is important for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. The reason is that the speed of the process of charge recombination (on the nanosecond scale) is significantly higher than that of the process of surface redox (10−8 to 10−1 s).26 Therefore, enhancing photo-generated carrier separation to suppress the recombination rate, as well as extending light harvesting to longer wavelengths, can generate more available electrons and holes for redox reactions. Generally, effective light harvesting and a suitable band structure are two of the factors guaranteeing the thermodynamic photo-generation of charge pairs. Generally, the charge migration from the internal bulk to the surface and subsequent effective contact with redox-active substrates both affect the overall kinetic efficiency of solar-to-fuel conversion.
Photocatalytic reactions, triggered by highly reactive charge carriers, start from the generation of photo-excited electron–hole pairs. Then the electrons and holes are separated and transfer to the surface of the semiconductor photocatalyst. In molecular catalysis, the excited-state charge separation of photocatalysts is also a key factor in catalytic availability and efficiency.27–29
The chemical composition of most CMPs is nothing but carbon. As a result, with the transfer of charge, it is not enough to avoid the electron–hole pairs induced by photons recombining spontaneously;30 efficient photocatalysis based on CMPs has great dependence on the migration of electrons to a specific co-catalyst, for example, platinum. There is another strategy that can be adopted to separate the charge effectively; different domains or point defects can be introduced to improve the probability of electron–hole separation. Therefore, the photocatalytic activity can be improved. The results are confirmed for azine-based covalent organic frameworks.31
Within the molecular structure of the catalyst, only donor acceptor dyads hold the key to preventing undesired electron–hole recombination via efficient charge separation. Building on the incorporation of electron-donating, sulphur-containing electron-rich linkers and electron-deficient triazine (C3N3) units into porous polymers, Bojdys32 reported the construction of several visible-light active, triazine-based polymers (Fig. 6) with a high ratio of S and N heteroatoms. The polymeric semiconductors photocatalytically generated H2 from H2O: up to 915 mmol h−1 g−1 with a Pt co-catalyst, and 200 mmol h−1 g−1 without, which is one of the highest reported values to date. The highly modular Sonogashira–Hagihara cross-coupling reaction was employed, enabling the systematic study of mixed (S, N, C) and (N, C)-only polymer systems.

Another external strategy for promoting charge separation is construction of direct Z-scheme systems. In these, the interface contact (i.e., boundary) is of great importance because photo-induced electrons can be injected directly into the VB of semiconductor I from the CB of semiconductor II or through an intermediate with a more conductive feature, and such catalysts are known as all-solid-state Z-scheme catalyst systems.33 Taking the example of CO2 reduction, the oxidation of redox mediators that are reduced and the reduction to solar fuels take place at one photocatalyst; at the same time, the oxidation of H2O to O2 or the reduction of redox mediators that are oxidised occurs at the other one, so as to simulate the photosynthesis process of plants in nature.34 Considering the intrinsic compatibility of organic semiconductors, this strategy is highly suitable for the construction of Z-scheme photocatalytic systems using different metal-free polymeric semiconductors.35
3.3 Functional units
Until now, many kinds of conjugated groups including pyrene, bipyridyl, benzothiadiazole, triazine, porphyrin, carbazole, perylene, sulfone, thienothiophene and truxene have been frequently used as the functional units of metal-free polymeric photocatalysts (Table 1). Many 3-D building blocks, such as the tetrahedral monomers used in covalent organic frameworks (COFs), cannot be used to synthesise CMPs because the tetrahedral node (e.g., saturated carbon atom) breaks the widely spread π-conjugation. However, one of the reported strategies to avoid this is the use of spirobifluorene linkers.87,88 Novel functional segments and the corresponding materials are still to be discovered in the search for much more effective organic semiconductor photocatalysts for chemical transformations.
Benzothiadiazole-containing and benzoxadiazole-containing CMPs were synthesised by Zhang et al. through a Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling reaction.89,90 Subsequently, the research group presented a simple structural design principle for CMPs, and it is a heterogeneous system of photocatalysis which is purely organic, to realize the fine-tuning of the photoredox potential.16,90,91 If the positions of substitutions at the central unit of phenyl are changed, then the increased activities of catalysts can be regulated. It serves as a 3D centre of a number of poly(benzoxadiazole) networks (Fig. 7). For polymers, the positions of the CB and VB can be best aligned to include the needed oxidative and reductive potentials of the catalytic reactions, and there is no need to alter the moieties of the electron acceptor and donor in the backbone of the polymer network.

Conjugated donor–acceptor dyads hold the key to the tuning of the electrochemical properties and reactivity by enhancing the mobility of charge carriers. A number of porous polymers (SNPs, Fig. 8) that contain a range of nitrogen and sulphur species were synthesised by Bojdys et al.,32 and they are realized through linking electron-donating sulphur-containing units and electron-withdrawing triazine (C3N3) groups. Because the specific synthetic conditions (Sonogashira–Hagihara cross-coupling) and the building blocks are selected, the optical band gap is between 1.67 and 2.58 eV; for the microporous materials and their ordering on the nanoscale, the BET surface area reaches 545 m2 g−1, while the CO2 capacities reach 1.56 mmol g−1.

Through determination of critical functional units and the observation of special design principles, a library of donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) CMP photocatalysts was reported by Jiang,75 for which pyrene serves as the donor, benzothiadiazole serves as the acceptor, and benzene serves as the units of the π-crosslinker. The proportion of pyrene in the benzothiadiazole units is adjusted, and then a number of CMPs (Fig. 9) that have all kinds of polymeric components and structures have been synthesised. A photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of up to 106 μmol h−1 was achieved on PyBT-2 with a 9:2 pyrene:benzothiadiazole ratio under UV-vis light irradiation (λ > 300 nm). The authors also applied perylene to synthesise a range of different substituted benzene derivatives and construct perylene-containing conjugated microporous polymers (PrCMPs, Fig. 10).54 It was found that among the PrCMPs, PrCMP-3 showed the highest HER (12.1 μmol h−1) under UV-vis light irradiation and long-time photocatalytic stability because of its high surface area, broad light absorption and suitable bandgap. The linking principle (perylene core and phenyl bonding) of the molecular geometry offers a rational design for CMP photocatalysts.

Porphyrin, as a large conjugated building block, has also been selected to construct CMPs partially due to the planar structural feature. Li et al.63 reported a series of 2-D fully conjugated microporous polymers (benzobisoxazole-linked porphyrin-based CMPs, Fig. 11), BBO-Por-CMP and BBO-MPor-CMPs (M = Zn, Cu, Ni). The critical feature when using porphyrins as building blocks is that benzobisoxazoles as bridge linkers efficiently prevent porphyrin aggregation, and increase the exposure of the majority of the porphyrin units to oxygen, thus enhancing the photocatalytic capability. Also, a metal-free covalent organic polymer (TpPAM, Fig. 12) which is based on porphyrin was obtained by Pradhan, Bhaumik et al.92 through the condensation between 5,10,15,20-tetra(4-aminophenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin (PAM) and triformyl phloroglucinol (Tp). The obtained porous TpPAM displayed excellent activities for the evolution of hydrogen. The current density reaches 10 mA cm−2 when the overpotential is as low as 250 mV, and the Tafel slope reaches 106 mV decade−1. It is found that, for the electrode based on TpPAM, the faradaic efficiency reaches as high as 98%, very close to the 100% ideal value, which suggests that it might be feasible in real applications. In addition, the as-obtained catalysts exhibited excellent stability, because after 1000 cycles, most of the original current density was retained, and the retention rate reaches 91%.

More recently, Pal and Kailasam59 reported a metal-free truxene-based CMP (Tx-CMP, Fig. 13) and demonstrated its outstanding heterogeneous photocatalytic performance in the oxidative homocoupling of amines. Noticeably and interestingly, the reaction could be activated under direct natural sunlight within 4 h. For the photocatalytic mechanism, this reaction was initiated generally by the charge carriers. The holes in the VB of Tx-CMP oxidised benzyl cyanide to the benzylamine radical cation. Once the benzylamine radical cation formed, the acidity of the benzylic hydrogen atom adjacent to the amine functional group increased and this hydrogen was abstracted by photocatalytic reactive oxygen species that formed during the reaction, forming the benzyliminium ion (Fig. 13).

3.4 Connecting bonds of functional units
For conjugated polymeric semiconductors, the bonds that connect small conjugated molecules to form polymers should also be conjugated. This avoids disruption of the overall π-conjugation as well as the monomers or precursors of the functional units. Therefore, the synthetic methods and routes for π-conjugated polymeric photocatalysts are strictly restricted because of the requirement to avoid disrupting the molecular π-conjugation. Organic reactions such as the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction, Sonogashira–Hagihara reaction, Heck reaction, oxidative coupling reaction, Yamamoto reaction, Schiff-base reaction, phenazine ring reaction and cyclotrimerisation have been reported to be effective for the preparation of various metal-free polymeric catalysts to form aryl C–C, CC, CC, CN, phenazine and triazine bonds or units (Fig. 14). Notably, the Schiff-base reaction will disrupt the conjugation continuity of conjugated functional groups due to the CN bonds. The most common connecting bonds used to synthesise metal-free polymeric semiconductors are summarised in Table 1.
 Fig. 14  Schematic illustration of the phenazine ring and cyclotrimerization reaction. 
Metal-free polymeric semiconductors are most commonly synthesised by solution-phase synthetic routes in conventional glassware or a hydro- (solvo-)thermal autoclave. But more unconventional routes also have their advantages. Microwave-assisted synthesis allows for time- and energy-efficient syntheses. In mechanochemistry, the materials are sometimes synthesised with a short time of reaction when there is no solvent or a little solvent. In the field of mechanochemistry, it seems that there is one report which is based on Friedel–Crafts alkylation, that is, when there is AlCl3, CTFs are formed through the reaction of the aromatic co-monomers and cyanuric chloride. A quantitative yield could be obtained in 1 hour, and the mechanochemical synthesis is free of solvent.93 It is also possible to postsynthetically modify CMPs.94-96
3.5 Dimensional design
Linear (1-D) conjugated polymers (CPs) have superiorities in molecular design, material synthesis and processing due to the relatively easy modification of two-functional-group monomers. Furthermore, 1-D CPs set the foundation of metal-free polymeric materials with the development of synthetic methods and functional-unit effects at the molecular level. However, with combined features of high porosity, light-weight elements and strong covalently bonded structures, dimensional extension of metal-free materials from linear structures (1D) to 2D or 3D results in superior exciton dissociation and yields to efficiently generate free charges and abundant reactive sites. The strategy has been proven to facilitate photocatalytic redox reaction processes.97,98

Linear (1-D) conjugated polymers. 
In 1985, Yanagida et al. published pioneering work on conjugated photocatalysts [linear poly(p-phenylene)s] for the evolution of H2. However, due to the poor stability and activity, there are only a few studies on conjugated polymeric semiconductors which are organic and linear for the photocatalytic evolution of H2.99,100 Although the AQY (0.015% at λ = 405 nm, with a ruthenium co-catalyst) was poor in comparison with inorganic counterparts, this result opened up a new avenue for the design of efficient and low-cost organic semiconductors for photocatalytic H2 evolution from H2O under solar light irradiation. Allowing for different conjugated polymers and great diversity of their structure and composition, the research brings possibilities for the development of materials that absorb light for artificial photosynthesis.
Nevertheless, polymeric photocatalysts are still challenging. There is a limitation for most linear polymer semiconductors, because the binding energy of excitons is high, which ranges between 0.5 and 1 eV. If the crystal semiconductors are inorganic, such as ZnO, the binding energy is no more than 60 MeV. To overcome this issue, organic semiconductor heterojunction nanoparticles have been constructed based on a 1D donor CP (PTB7-Th) and a non-fullerene acceptor (EH-IDTBR, Fig. 15) to enhance photocatalytic hydrogen evolution to as high as 60000 μmol g−1 h−1 under 350 to 800nm illumination.101 The well-designed intermixed donor/acceptor blend boosted efficient intrinsic charge generation and decreased the binding energy of excitons, ultimately resulting in a greatly increased hydrogen evolution efficiency.

Organoborane compounds have also been used to construct linear conjugated polymers for photocatalysis. When electron-deficient borole units were introduced to the well-explored thiophene units, of variable length102 (Fig. 16), the obtained oligomers exhibited high activity for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (HER = 223 μmol g−1 h−1) under visible light (λ > 420 nm), outperforming most of the reported linear polymers. The report provides a new avenue for the design of highly efficient conjugated (oligo)polymers for photocatalytic hydrogen generation.

Two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) metal-free materials. 
Another challenge for linear conjugated polymers is their low specific surface area because of the condensed morphology. This results in insufficient intimate contact with substrates and few active sites, and ultimately a low photocatalytic efficiency. Therefore, expanding the dimensions of conjugated polymers from 1D to 2D or 3D has been shown to resolve the above mentioned limitations by decreasing the Coulomb binding energy for dissociating electron–hole pairs and increasing the specific surface area. It is thus of pivotal importance to design new conjugated polymers with extended dimensions to promote exciton splitting and active sites, and ultimately improve the photocatalytic activity for chemical reactions.
Since 2009, as a distinctive kind of 2-D material, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has gained wide attention due to the considerable activity for photocatalytic chemical transformations because of its multiple properties including light weight, metal free nature, stability, low cost and visible light activity. Several reports have reviewed the recent work related to graphitic carbon nitride materials.12,13,103 This review is focused on other kinds of various promising 2D and 3D metal-free polymeric photocatalysts for chemical transformations. Polymerisation of planar and rigid monomers with more than two functional groups will give polymers with a 2D chemical structure. Homocoupling of trifunctional or polyfunctional monomers can result in 3D porous networks. Monomers which are two-dimensional can afford three dimensional polymers, because, in the process of reactions, the core–linker bonds are rotating freely, and integral 2-D pores might not be formed through the subsequent reactions.104
The superiority of metal-free polymeric 2D materials to others lies not only in their improved specific surface area but also in their high degree of π-conjugation.1 Among the materials that are two dimensional, π-stacked columns which are assembled on their own help transport the electrons in the layers.105 Besides, if the linkage for the single building blocks (the components of 2-D layers) is π-conjugated, for example, in frameworks that are linked by imines, it is possible that conductivity can be developed in other directions, not only in the conjugated plane. With open channels that are aligned around the molecular stacks, for host materials, their properties can be changed, and the functionality can be extended by integrating guest molecules, for example, iodine, tetracyanoquinodimethane and fullerenes.106–108 Bein and co-workers109 demonstrated that synchronised offset stacking is an effective concept and tool for growing large-domain and highly crystalline 2D COFs (Fig. 17). Spectroscopic data indicated considerable delocalisation of excitation along the π-stacked columns and the feasibility of donor acceptor excitation across the imine bonds. This work confirmed the possibility of electronic communication within the π-stacked central building blocks and π-stacked bridges between all subunits due to the highly crystalline frameworks. The research also showed the significant role of imine bonds in charge-transfer excitations and draws a blueprint for the development of well-tuned 2-D COFs with large π-conjugation.

Incorporating spatial building blocks instead of planar ones results in products that exhibit 3D features in the chemical structure. If the connecting bonds of the conjugated units are also π-electron delocalised, CMPs will be obtained; otherwise, COFs are produced. By proper selection of building blocks and cross-linking strategies, the porous architectures of CMPs or COFs can be finely tuned and this allows for the optimisation of their properties and skeleton. Owing to their cross-linked polymeric structures, almost all CMP or COF frameworks are not soluble and difficult to process, which hinders not only the assessment of their conductivity but also the preparation of high-quality thin films in electronic devices. Sun and Wang110 investigated the influence of dimensionality on functionality for 2D and 3D porphyrinic COFs (Fig. 18) originating from phenylenediamine and tetra(p-aminophenyl)methane starting materials, respectively. The results revealed that the 3D COF showed higher CO2 adsorption capacity, better photocatalytic performance in the selective oxidation of thioanisole to methyl phenyl sulfoxide and size-selective photocatalysis.

Cooper and Han50,111 reported a noble-metal-free CMP (Fig. 19) synthesised by integrating rose bengal dye into the skeleton of CMP by Sonogashira–Hagihara cross-coupling polycondensation. It was also demonstrated by Wu and Xu53 that CMP nanosheets (CMPNs) which are linked by 1,3-diyne and obtained through terminal alkyne oxidative coupling (for example, 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene and 1,3,5-tris-(4-ethynylphenyl)-benzene) can be used as photocatalysts that can split pure water into stoichiometric quantities of O2 and H2 under visible light in a highly efficient way. The apparent quantum efficiency at 420 nm is 7.6% and 10.3% for CMPNs made of TEB and TEPB, respectively; the efficiency of solar-to-hydrogen conversion, which is actually measured with the aid of the full solar spectrum, is up to 0.6%, which exceeded photosynthetic plants when solar energy is conversed into biomass (the global average equals 0.10%). Furthermore, Sood112 thoroughly investigated the semiconducting properties of a poly(1,3,5-triethynylbenzene) CMP network (PTEB, Fig. 20) using various spectroscopic, microscopic and electrochemical techniques. The polymer was found to be slightly n-doped with a work function of 4.65 eV, and the HOMO level of the material was well-positioned for water oxidation, and the driving force for thermodynamic water splitting was observed to increase with increasing pH.

To fully utilize the synergistic effect of adsorption (high specific surface area) and photocatalysis (abundant active sites), large π-conjugated systems with rigid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structures have been introduced into CMPs due to their high specific surface area and narrow band gap. Cheng, Ouyang and Chen113 reported two types of CMPs synthesized via Sonogashira–Hagihara cross-coupling polycondensation based on 1,3,5-triethynylbenzene and 1,4-diethynylbenzene as the monomers. Chen70 also constructed a series of 9,9′-bifluorenylidene-based conjugated microporous/mesoporous polymers (BF-CMPs, Fig. 21) via Suzuki polycondensation.

Electron-accepting (A) functional units play a significant role in constructing D–A type conjugated 2-D and 3-D polymers, and it is not always easy to obtain this goal. Using fully sp2-carbon-derived electron-deficient tricyanomesitylene as functional units, Zhuang and Zhang45 reported a series of CMPs (Fig. 22) with substantial cyano-group substitution. The target polymers could promote organic base catalysed Knoevenagel condensation with various aldehyde-substituted arenes. The resulting porous polymers featured D–A structures with extended π-conjugation, affording them distinct semiconducting properties.

Similarly, via cost-effective Knoevenagel polycondensation, Han and Chen42 constructed cyanostilbene based CMPs (Fig. 23) that exhibited solid-state emissive properties. Tetra(4-cyanophenyl)ethylene is also an excellent building block to construct 3-D CMPs. Bhunia and Jania36 reported a highly photoluminescent (PL) porous covalent triazine-based framework (PCTF-8, Fig. 24) which was synthesised at room temperature from tetra(4-cyanophenyl)ethylene with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid as the catalyst. This nitrogen-rich framework exhibited good ideal selectivity (61:1 (85% N2:15% CO2) at 273 K and 1 bar).

4 Photocatalytic chemical transformations
In the last decades, photocatalysis has been demonstrated to be one of the most promising approaches for environmental protection, solar energy conversion, and chemical transformations in the sustainable production of fuels. Visible light active photocatalysts such as metal-complexes, metal oxides, plasmonic photocatalysts and polymeric carbon nitride have been utilised for selective redox organic transformations.114,115 However, visible light induced photocatalysis with metal-free, highly conjugated polymeric catalysts is a relatively new area of materials science compared to the abovementioned categories. The current status of research on metal-free polymeric materials has been highlighted for photocatalytic energy conversion and utilisation including photocatalytic water splitting and CO2 reduction, and other photo-assisted selective conversion of organic compounds, N2 reduction, pollutant degradation and biological disinfection. This review will not discuss the applications of pollutant degradation and biological disinfection.
4.1 Water splitting
Particulate semiconductors are utilized to photocatalytically split water, and this is one of the most convenient ways in which photosynthesis can be imitated so that solar energy can be turned into renewable and clean H2 fuel that can actually be exploited and stored from the natural resource of water.116–118 So far, among the photocatalysts that have been developed, most of them are inorganic (oxy)nitrides, (oxy)sulfides and inorganic metal oxides, which are generally constructed on the basis of metal cations with electronic configuration features of d10 and d0. However, in most cases, their light-response properties have certain limitations. By contrast, due to the π-electron system which is delocalized, visible light can be absorbed by conjugated materials. Because of the relatively low efficiency (AQY = 0.006% for H2 production under UV-light irradiation, λ > 366 nm), there has been substantial interest in the design and synthesis of conjugated polymers for photocatalytic H2 evolution beyond C3N4 materials, which have been well reviewed.8,12,13,103,119–122
For photocatalytic water splitting, the electron-efficient dibenzo[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide group is also effective in the construction of photoactive CMPs. Chen74 reported three conjugated microporous poly(dibenzo[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide)s (B-DTs, Fig. 25) consisting of alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient units with ethynyl linkers. The range of the optical bandgap is between 2.29 eV and 2.79 eV, and if the CC unit is adjusted through the linkage to the central benzene in the three dimensional structure, this range can be well tuned. Allowing for its intrinsic advantages, such as the large BET surface area, the easily tunable bandgap etc., it is found that the as-obtained CMP (B-DT) is an ideal photocatalyst for the photocatalytic removal of NO. Later, it was demonstrated by Cooper71 and Jiang72 that crystalline COFs (Fig. 26 and 27) which are constructed on the basis of the benzo-bis(benzothiophene sulfone) moiety displayed greater activities for the photochemical evolution of hydrogen compared with their semicrystalline and amorphous counterparts. Computations suggested that the geometry of the polymer skeleton and the fine detail of the eclipsed conjugated unit layered stacking in the FS-COF might determine its prospects for thermodynamic proton reduction and water oxidation, and finally enabled a considerable improvement in the efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

The molecular mechanism and reaction kinetics need to be considered carefully when designing photocatalytic hydrogen production systems involving metal-free catalysts, due to different catalyst molecules with different degrees of polymerisation and by-product pollution.18,123,124 Nevertheless, such an admirable goal as the practical application production of H2 and O2 through water-splitting systems is especially interesting in light of worldwide energy and environmental concerns. However, although some photocatalysts have band edges covering both the water oxidation and reduction potentials, they usually only trigger half of the photocatalytic water splitting reaction, i.e. the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER), due to insufficient driving force provided by the irradiation-induced electrons or holes. Hence, achieving the complete water-splitting reaction is highly challenging. Very recently, a report125 presented a route to design practical 2-D COFs as metal-free and single-material photocatalysts (Fig. 28) for complete water splitting under visible light. The electronic band structures could be adjusted well with HER- and OER-active functional units which were incorporated in a single material. The position of both the CB and VB edges of three 2-D COFs matched well with the chemical reaction potential of H2/H+ and O2/H2O and they were capable of photocatalysing the complete water-splitting reaction.

4.2 CO2 reduction
Compared to C–H (411 kJ mol−1), C–O (327 kJ mol−1) and C–C (336 kJ mol−1), the thermodynamic stability of carbon dioxide as a kind of linear molecule is higher because the CO bond energy is much greater (750 kJ mol−1). For this reason, in the photocatalytic conversion of CO2, a large amount of energy input is needed to break the bonds of CO.
An efficient CO2-transformation process needs a photocatalyst with a suitable band structure for excitation by sunlight, and then migration of the photogenerated electrons to reduce CO2. However, CO2 reduction with one electron is not favourable thermodynamically, because for CO2/CO2− (−1.90 V vs. NHE, at pH 7.00) its negative redox potential is high. On the contrary, multi-electron reduction with the assistance of protons is more favourable, because the redox potential is relatively low (Fig. 29).3

In most cases, if the CB levels are a little higher than the CO2 redox potential, the product of reduction would transfer the photo-generated electrons from the photocatalyst to the CO2 species that are absorbed on the surface. Then they are converted into solar fuels step by step. For this reason, one can estimate that, if the charge separation, the light harvesting and CO2 adsorption or their synergistic effects are optimised, the activity of photocatalytic CO2 conversion can be improved. To get an ideal photocatalyst, there should be a lot of photocatalytic centres, the sites to which electrons are transferred should be close to other sites which serve as acids, and there should be at least one proton that is transferred for the generation of solar fuel in the system of CO2 reduction.
Beyond B–O, C–N, and B–N bonds, El-Kaderi and coworkers126 reported on the synthesis of high surface area mesoporous imine-linked COFs with CN bonds (Fig. 30), and demonstrated that the use of expanded pyrene cores in the construction of COFs with imine linkages could significantly enhance the porosity, give high crystallinity and prevent network interpenetration, and finally improve the promising gas storage properties of high-pressure H2, CH4 and CO2. The strong π–π stacking interactions of the pyrene moieties not only directed 2-D solid-state packing, but also prevented network interpenetration and thereby enhanced the porosity and performance of COFs in gas storage. This research should give considerable inspiration for improving CO2 adsorption, which is the first and significant step of the CO2 reduction processes. To further utilize this effect, very recently Chen and Ye127 reported the construction of intermolecular cascaded π-conjugation channels for powering CO2 photoreduction by modifying both intramolecular and intermolecular conjugation of CPs (Fig. 31). The coordination of dual conjugation was firstly proved by theoretical calculations and transient spectroscopies, and promoted a CO evolution activity of 2247 μmol g−1 h−1 with a remarkable enhancement of 138-times compared to the unmodified ones.

Additionally, Huang and co-workers76 constructed imine-based 2-D COFs (Fig. 32) from bipyridyl-dialdehyde (BPDA) and triazine-trianiline (TTA) by solvothermal reactions. Interestingly and notably, the retained bipyridine groups could be incorporated with Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl into 2-D triazine COFs via post-synthetic modification. The system could efficiently reduce CO2 with better activity than its homogeneous counterpart, and with high selectivity and stability. This study revealed that light absorption and charge transfer from the photoexcited COF to the Re moiety were the key initial steps to determine whether Re-COF was a suitable photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. At the same time, UV-vis spectroscopy with diffuse reflectance in situ reveals three critical intermediate species, and these species explain the transfer dynamics of charge, the period of induction and the rate-limiting steps in the reduction of CO2. From the results, it is found that CMPs and COFs have great potential of becoming effective photocatalysts of solar fuels, and we can obtain novel insights into the catalytic mechanism of reduction of CO2 with semiconductors that are metal free, polymeric and π-conjugated.

Commonly used dyes have also been incorporated into polymeric semiconductors and investigated for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Yang and Liu85 reported eosin Y-functionalised CMPs (PEosinY-N, N = 1–3, Fig. 33) with high surface areas up to 610 m2 g−1. These exhibited high activity for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO (a production rate of 33 μmol g−1 h−1 and a selectivity of 92%) in the presence of gaseous H2O and visible light irradiation, without any photosensitiser or sacrificial reagent. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the eosinY sites could adsorb and activate the CO2 and H2O molecules, and the conjugated structure of PEosinY-N enabled light absorption and efficient electron/hole separation, as well as the adsorption and activation of CO2 and H2O. This work expanded the scope of efficient functional units or monomers of photocatalytically active polymers with highly efficient CO2 conversion.

The CO2 cycloaddition reaction is also an efficient way to achieve CO2 activation and conversion. Ma67 successfully prepared new metal-free bifunctional porous organic framework (POF) heterogeneous catalyst POF–PNA–Br−via a two-step method (Fig. 34). Because of the synergistic effect of Brønsted acidic sites (carboxylic acid groups) and nucleophilic sites (Br− generated from pyridine-based ionic liquids), as a bifunctional metal-free environmentally-friendly heterogeneous catalyst POF–PNA–Br− displayed efficient catalytic performance for the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxide to form cyclic carbonate under mild and cocatalyst-free conditions. The work provides an efficient new method for the design and synthesis of bifunctional POF catalysts for CO2 conversion.

4.3 Organic reactions

Organic synthesis. 
Recently, polymeric semiconducting photocatalysts for organic synthesis represent a more sustainable, easy post-treatment and separation, and environment-friendly alternative to traditional metallic photocatalysts because of their absorption in the visible range, non-metal and non-toxic nature, and highly tunable optical and electronical properties.42,56,128 Clearly, photoredox catalysis for relevant chemical reactions have emerged as an important application of conjugated polymeric semiconductors.
According to the definition made before, organic synthesis which is realized through a redox pathway can be categorised as reduction reactions and oxidation reactions in terms of the substrate. Commonly, oxidation reactions include oxidative coupling for the formation of carbon–heteroatom bonds and carbon–carbon bonds and oxidative degradation of organic contaminants. Reduction reactions include the hydrogenation of carbon–heteroatom bonds or reductive bond formation. For photocatalytic oxidation reactions, molecular oxygen is often observed in the catalytic cycle. Generally, the active oxygen species singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radicals (O2˙−) can be generated through the pathway of energy and electron transfer from the photocatalyst to molecular oxygen, respectively. In particular, it is found that the photogenerated 1O2 is quite important in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, natural compounds and fine chemicals as well as photodynamic therapy.129
Lately, large semiconductor photocatalysts that are polymeric and π-conjugated have become a stable and efficient platform for a large range of chemical reactions by light, including molecular oxygen excitation,10 selective oxidation of organic sulfides,11 C–C bond coupling,111,130 reductive dehalogenation,131 oxidation of arylboronic acids,130 controlled free radical and cationic polymerization by visible or near-infrared light,83,84 and light-induced H2 evolution.132
Among the large π-conjugated photocatalysts, poly(benzothiadiazoles) and their derivatives have demonstrated the ability to catalyse various organic photoredox reactions under visible light irradiation.91 As shown in Fig. 35 and 36, CMP-T1, CMP-T2, CMP-T3, and CMP-T4 have been found to be efficient photosensitisers that generate singlet oxygen (1O2) under irradiation.10,41,133,134 CMP-T1 based on benzothiadiazole as the building block was developed by palladium-catalysed Sonogashira coupling polycondensation. By using CMP-T1 as a singlet oxygen photosensitiser, α-terpinene was smoothly converted into α-scaridole with 420 nm blue light, which was the first example of the photocatalytic application of CMPs for generating singlet oxygen. Also, both CMP-T3 and CMP-T4 synthesized by Vilela and Xu, respectively, displayed excellent photocatalytic activity for 1O2 generation. To enhance the water dispersibility, Vilela attempted the modification of CMP-T1 by utilising thiolyne chemistry to produce water compatible CMP-T2, which was proved to be an active heterogeneous photocatalyst in the 1O2-induced conversion of 2-furoic acid to 5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone by using water as the solvent.

Benzothiadiazole-based metal-free polymeric semiconductors are also effective in generating other active species including electrons, O2˙−, and OH˙. Through a metal-free synthetic route, Zhang and co-workers16 reported a conjugated polymer with high surface area as an efficient networked photocatalyst (Fig. 37) for the hydroxylation of arylboronic acids with a high functional group tolerance of the substrates. Upon light exposure, the photoexcited electrons were quenched by oxygen to form superoxide radical anions, which were the key active species reacting with the boronic acid to form the peroxide radical A as an intermediate. Also, poly(benzothiadiazole) (B-BT, Fig. 38) was effective in the generation of electrons and activation of superoxide O2˙−, which catalysed [2+2] cycloaddition of styrene derivatives.47

From the perspective of the bromine source, many bromination reactions involve volatile corrosive and toxic reaction conditions when elemental bromine is used. Another disadvantage is the only half usage of the bromine atoms in reactions compared with the equivalent moles of hydrogen bromide (HBr) as a by-product. Benzothiadiazole-based metal-free polymeric semiconductors (Fig. 39) were found to be highly effective in selective bromination of electron-rich aromatic substrates using bromine-source HBr and oxygen gas as a clean oxidant under visible-light irradiation.134

Similarly to benzothiadiazole, benzoxadiazole was also incorporated into CMPs to give polymeric photocatalysts for chemical reactions. One example was a benzoxadiazoleand-based CMP with 1,3,5-trisubstitution of the central phenyl ring, which demonstrated superior photocatalytic activity in the oxidative coupling of amines (Fig. 40).90

Common synthetic approaches to generate benzophosphole oxides usually involve the utilisation of transition metal catalysts and elevated temperatures. For the first time, Zhang and co-workers60 reported a photocatalytic method (Fig. 41) using asy-CTF for the visible light-promoted synthesis of 1,2,3-triphenylphosphindole-1-oxide (3a) with starting materials of diphenylphosphine oxide (1a) and diphenylacetylene (2a) in the presence of a base and N-ethoxy-2-methylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate as an oxidant. The reported most plausible mechanism revealed that the photocatalytic activity originated from single electron transfer (SET) on the excited-state LUMO and holes on the excited-state HOMO, and then from the subsequently generated ethoxy radical, phosphinoyl radical, alkenyl radical, cyclohexadienyl radical and cation intermediates.

The poor performance in selective oxidation reactions of organic semiconductor photocatalysts could be in part due to their insufficient photogenerated oxidation potential, as a result of their usually high HOMO levels or VB positions.136 To solve the shortcoming with pure organic photocatalysts, a suitable design should be made for the arrangement of electron donor–acceptor motifs in the organic semiconductor's backbone structure, so that the energetic band level can be reduced, and the short-range delocalisation of electrons can be enhanced with the photocatalytic efficiency finally improved.
Highly electron-deficient triazine-based triamines are effective knots for the construction of novel 2-D COFs (COF-JLU5, Fig. 42); these have the election-rich –OMe group adjacent to the Schiff-base.56 COF-JLU5 was found to be a highly efficient, metal-free, recyclable heterogeneous photocatalyst for oxidative C–H functionalization (C–C and C–P coupling reactions of N-phenyltetrahydroisoquinonlines with various nucleophiles) under visible light irradiation using O2 as an environmentally friendly oxygen source. The outstanding photocatalytic performance was ascribed to the redox potential (−1.50 V) of the excited state COF-JLU5+/COF-JLU5* couple and the onset potential (0.90 V vs. SCE) was attributable to the redox potential of the COF-JLU5+/COF-JLU5 couple.

Incorporation of nitrogen-containing conjugated structures allows the application of electron-rich nitrogen-containing π-conjugated CMPs such as carbazoles as redox-active photocatalysts, one kind of which is carbon nitride materials. Loh18 reported a carbazolic CMP (C-CMP, Fig. 43) which was highly effective in photocatalysis of CN formation and selective oxidation of sulphide under an oxygen atmosphere and visible light irradiation. Especially, polymeric semiconductors can be tuned at the molecular level with substituent modification or backbone-structure change. With the guidance of the photocatalytic molecular mechanism, it is believed that CMPs will inspire the development of powerful and workable photocatalysts for chemical transformations with sustainable sunlight.

Photocatalytic oxidative homocoupling of benzylamine is one of the important C–C or C–N coupling reactions.59 Based on carbazolic functional units, Xia and Liu55 reported a highly effective heterogeneous photocatalyst CF-HCP (Fig. 44) for a wide range of organic reactions using molecular oxygen as a clean oxidant. The research revealed that two active oxygen species (1O2 and O2˙−) were involved in the photo-oxidative coupling reaction of benzylamine and that the fluorenone knots should play a significant role in the generation of the active oxygen species through determining the VB potential (1.38 eV).

For the formation of C–C bonds from aryl stannanes and aryl halides, the Stille cross-coupling reaction can be considered as a powerful instrument. However, in the case of Stille coupling, palladium complexes should be used as the catalyst. For material and organic chemists, they still need to find an alternative catalyst persistently, which is not only free of palladium but also purely organic. Promisingly, Zhang and co-workers46 reported a conjugated azulene-containing CMP, which enabled photocatalytic Stille-type coupling of aryl iodides and aryl stannanes (Fig. 45).

The novel coupling reaction mechanism takes place between the aryl iodide that is activated by an electron and the photogenerated aryl radical which is formed through oxidative aryl stannane destannylation, and, as a result, the aromatic reaction of C–C bond formation occurred. The visible light induced Stille coupling reaction with a metal-free photocatalyst based on a polymer semiconductor provides a synthetic means featuring cost-performance, sustainability and simplicity for the aromatic formation of C–C bonds which is free of palladium.


Monomer polymerization. 
Besides photocatalytic organic synthesis, light-irradiation polymerisation offers a good alternative to thermal polymerization, which is usually slow, difficult to control and interior processing in depth, and expensive as it requires high temperature and high energy, and releases solvent (VOC).135 In the domain of photo-initiated polymerisation, a photoredox catalyst refers to a system that initiates radicals, and such a system can regenerate during the reaction of polymerisation. The regeneration in a catalytical cycle is realized on the basis of the reaction of oxido-reduction between a suitable additive and the light-absorbing compound (i.e. photocatalyst or photo-initiator).137 In general, in the state of being excited, the photocatalyst displays a redox potential which is highly reactive referring to its ground state, so that it reacts with the reducing and oxidising agent effectively in a catalytic cycle, and then the cation initiating and active radical species are generated (Fig. 46). Upon excitation of the photoredox catalyst, one electron moves from the HOMO to the LUMO, so the HOMO lacks one electron while the LUMO has an electron. Therefore, compared to the one in the ground state, the photoredox catalyst once excited is not only a stronger reductant, but also a stronger oxidant. For this reason, with a reductant or an oxidant, the reaction of photocatalysts can occur more easily.

However, continuous concern has existed around the sustainability and cost of precious metals as well as trace metal contamination, which can impede the electric and biological applications of the resulting materials. Although tremendous efforts to develop purification techniques and catalyst strategies have succeeded in decreasing transition metal contamination,139,140 there is considerable interest in the development of organocatalysed atom transfer radical polymerisation (O-ATRP) as a more direct route to eliminate this issue. Similarly to metal complexes, organic PCs that directly reduce alkyl bromide bonds are uncommon.141 As of this contribution, fourteen kinds of visible light-active organic PCs (Fig. 47), including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenothiazines, phenazines, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, phenoxazines and triazoles, have been developed for photocatalysis in O-ATRP.

Organic dyes138,144–146 have been widely utilized in three-component photocatalytic polymerisation systems (monomers, initiators and catalysts), but their short-period storage stability and decomposition during the reaction process prevent further use in catalytic quantities. The relatively stable polyaromatic and triazine-based compounds78,145,147 (compounds 9–14 in Fig. 47) with a large degree of conjugation could be a good option for metal-free photocatalysts.
Lalevée77 proposed new initiating systems (Fig. 48) of trifunctional photo-initiators based on benzophenone, anthracene and pyrene chromophores linked to a triazine moiety. With the auxiliary effect of iodonium salts and silanes, these metal-free catalysts can initiate the radical polymerization of acrylates (upon addition of an amine) and the cationic polymerization of epoxides and vinylethers under various light sources (Xe–Hg lamp, LED or halogen lamp).

The heterogeneous nature and stable 3-D structure of metal-free CMPs or COFs allow their facile removal from the polymerisation mixture and reuse without a significant loss of activity. Additionally, π-conjugated semiconductor-based photo-initiators minimise odour, toxicity and migration problems, which usually accompany low molar mass photo-initiators. Thus far, reports of highly conjugated polymeric CMP or COF semiconductors have been rare in the application of monomer polymerisation. In 2014, Zhang83 reported benzoxadiazole- and carbazole-based porous π-conjugated CMPs (Fig. 49) which could serve as a heterogeneous photo-initiator for the radical polymerisation of methyl methacrylate (MMA) under visible light irradiation by a household energy-saving light bulb at room temperature. This report verified that photopolymerisation of MMA using a π-conjugated metal-free polymeric semiconductor as a heterogeneous photo-initiator could be efficiently achieved under visible light. Notably, if the functional groups of NPCCs available for photocatalytic monomer polymerisation are retained and introduced into the molecular skeletons of polymeric semiconductors, the corresponding metal-free catalysts should also possess photocatalytic activity for monomer polymerisation. Subsequently, Yagci84 reported a thioxanthone-based COF (Fig. 50) to initiate free radical and cationic polymerisation of vinyl monomers and cyclic ethers, respectively, under visible light irradiation. The heterogeneous nature of the photocatalytic system made the separation, recycling and reuse of the photo-initiators easier from the reaction media without loss of the photocatalytic activity for further polymerization, which is also one of the superiorities of metal-free polymeric photocatalysts over homogeneous metal-based or metal-free photocatalysts.

4.4 Nitrogen reduction
Conversion of naturally abundant dinitrogen (N2), which is found in excess of 70% in the earth's atmosphere, to ammonia (NH3), is one of the most attractive and challenging topics in chemistry: the very high kinetic and thermodynamic stability of triple-bonded N2 make it difficult to use as a substrate for chemical reactions.148 For practical use, one of the prerequisites for N2 fixation from solar energy and atmospheric air is a solar-to-NH3 (STA) efficiency of 0.1%. Although this high obstacle hinders the screening of effective catalysts as a great challenge for researchers, photocatalytic N2 reduction is still a promising alternative to the existing Haber–Bosch technique, especially for metal-free photocatalysts. Consequently, metal-free and solar-driven photocatalysts have been rarely explored, with current studies mainly focusing on the electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) or N2 fixation using B-modified or Fe-doped g-C3N4 in both experimental and theoretical studies. Other metal-free photocatalysts for N2 for N2 fixation under solar light have been seldom reported.64,149,150
In principle, the pioneering development of transition metal-based catalysts originates from the complicated electronic configuration of empty and occupied d orbitals existing in one atom, which matches well and simultaneously with the lone pair electrons and anti-bonding orbitals of N2 to weaken the strong NN triple bond (Fig. 51).151,152 The activated N2 bond then cleaves, eventually producing ammonia after then incorporation of protons and electrons from external sources. Therefore, metal-free catalysts for photocatalytic reduction of N2 using B atoms incorporated into g-C3N4 are effective if B atoms are introduced at the atom-level molecular plane. It is a tough process in ensuring an empty sp3 orbital and a half-occupied sp3 orbital of B atoms. One of the techniques is that each distinct B atom interacts with two N atoms to form two B–N bonds in C3N4 compounds. Therefore, the incorporated B atoms will have strong binding energy with N2 molecules and produce the possibility of photocatalytic activity of N2.65

A few reviews have reported recent progress on photocatalyst design for N2 reduction.153–155 Thermodynamically, it is particularly challenging to break the first bond in N2 molecules on the photocatalyst surface. The bond cleavage requires a reduction potential of −4.2 V versus NHE, which is not achievable by most semiconductors. To overcome this limitation, multielectron processes are more preferable to achieve lower reduction potentials during photocatalytic N2 reduction.155 The breakthrough should also involve the ultra-slow surface reaction concerning 6e−/6H+ dynamics, which finally determines the rate-limiting reductive activation of N2.156 Consequently, it is predicted that photocatalytic chemical N2 reduction or transformation with metal-free catalysts will be an area of great challenge and uncertainty for a long period in the future.
5 Conclusions, perspective, and outlook
Photocatalytic chemical transformation for solar fuel production using large π-conjugated metal-free semiconductors or organic catalysts can not only retard the problem of the greenhouse effect from CO2 emissions in the atmosphere, but also produce CO2-based chemicals from sustainable solar energy in principle. This review highlights the catalytic mechanism, design principles and structural construction of metal-free polymeric photocatalysts bearing large π-conjugated units, dedicated to photocatalytic chemical transformations including organic synthesis, monomer polymerization, water splitting and CO2 and nitrogen reduction. There are a growing number of studies in this popular field, and this research is performed with an aim to adjust catalysts’ intrinsic properties, such as the reactant mass transport on the nano scale, rapid interfacial reaction kinetics, rapid charge collection, transport and separation and exceptional light absorption.
Especially, due to the unsatisfactory light harvesting, low conversion efficiency, lack of selectivity to specified products, and complicated photocatalytic mechanisms, there is still a long road to pave for solving the scientific and technological obstructions to promote this artificial photosynthesis for potential use with abundant solar sources.
Despite the significant advances in the last 10 years in the field of metal-free photoredox catalysis, there remain many opportunities for further exploration. First, the most important task is to find a more selective and active photocatalyst with which the recombination of charge can be reduced efficiently, and the entire solar spectrum can be captured to increase the photocatalytic efficiency to be comparable with inorganic counterparts. The frequently reported non-polymeric conjugated compounds available for certain chemical reactions will provide considerable inspiration for the design and screening of effective metal-free, highly-conjugated polymeric catalysts for large-conjugation in photocatalytic chemical transformations.
There is another challenge, that is, the adsorption on the surface of photocatalysts should be optimised, as the capacity and state of adsorption can impose an influence on the substrate conversion in terms of its selectivity and activity both thermodynamically and kinetically.
Finally, a deeper understanding of photocatalytic mechanisms is required to accelerate the screening of specific catalysts for traditional chemical reactions. So far, there are only a few studies on the explanations and theories behind the collective heterostructure phenomena that have been observed. If there are more theoretical studies, the band structure can be improved in a rational way, and photocatalytic materials can be designed morphologically so that new materials can be discovered.
Ultimately, all results indicate that the photocatalytic conversion of chemicals into valuable energy-bearing fuels is still in its infancy, and that breakthroughs for bringing this technology to reality can occur when all these problems and strategies above have been taken into consideration, enabling a well-designed photocatalytic system.
