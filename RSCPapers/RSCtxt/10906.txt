    , Accepted 3rd August 2015First published on 3rd August 2015AbstractDonor–acceptor copolymers are an important class of conjugated polymer on account of their chemically tunable energy levels and ambipolar charge transport properties. These materials typically exhibit two strong absorption bands in the UV-visible range, whose natures have previously been explored using theoretical analyses. In this work, we experimentally elucidate the electronic origins of these transitions and consider their effects on photostability using resonant Raman spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy. In particular, we identify two dominant electronic transitions for a material comprising diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor and selenophene donor units: a strong transition at low energy (520–1150 nm) that is localised within the DPP unit, and a much weaker transition at higher energy (320–520 nm) that is delocalised along the conjugated backbone of both the DPP and selenophene units. The polymer is found to have good photostability under prolonged excitation in the low energy absorption band, but is much less stable to higher energy excitation. In this latter case, the selenophene ring is identified as the photodegradation site. These effects are correlated with ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy results, which associate the photodegradation with a higher yield of polaron pairs arising from excitation of the higher energy transition. Our findings provide insight into the design of photostable low energy gap conjugated copolymers for application in organic photovoltaic devices and demonstrate a specific vulnerability of the selenophene donor unit.

Broader context
Organic semiconductors including conjugated polymers and fullerenes continue to demonstrate promising potential for application in low-cost, printable solar cells. Power conversion efficiencies are now approaching 10%, and major attention is increasingly turning towards identifying and overcoming the degradation mechanisms that limit the device lifetime. Recent advances in the performance of organic photovoltaics have largely arisen through the development of novel molecular structures using a donor–acceptor copolymer motif. Copolymers incorporating diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units have attracted strong, widespread interest, but the main role of this unit in the optoelectronic properties and device performance is not yet clear. This work investigates the natures of the main optical absorption transitions of DPP-based copolymers and challenges the assumption that the DPP-unit behaves as a traditional acceptor unit. This insight leads to a clearer understanding of the excitation energy dependent photodegradation mechanism of the materials, providing ways to improve the operational stability of DPP-based solar cells.

Introduction
Donor–acceptor (D–A) type copolymers are an established and important class of conjugated polymer with widespread application in the field of organic semiconductor devices. The push–pull approach to tuning energy levels has been applied to organic light emitting materials for around a decade, and donor–acceptor copolymers also dominate recent reports of high performance organic photovoltaics and transistors.1–6 Particularly for photovoltaic applications, the low energy gaps of donor–acceptor copolymers are attractive since they can be tuned to optimise harvesting of the solar emission spectrum.7,8 The highly planar conjugated backbones of many of these polymers result in high charge carrier mobilities, which are critical for both transistor and solar cell applications.1,9–13
One particularly interesting electron-accepting unit is diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), which is highly electron-deficient and so can provide very low energy gap materials when combined with an electron rich donor unit such as thiophene or its derivatives. DPP-based copolymers currently yield some of the highest efficiency polymer solar cells (9% efficiency in a triple-junction) and DPP-based materials can also be good light-emitters.5,10,14–17 The high photovoltaic performance of D–A copolymers has been attributed in part to effective charge carrier transport,18–20 but particularly to efficient charge photogeneration related to the charge transfer character of the longest-wavelength electronic transitions.21–24 This charge transfer character was identified by Jespersen et al. in benzothiadiazole-containing copolymers based on semi-empirical quantum chemical calculations, with higher energy transitions having a more delocalised π–π* character.25 Whilst this understanding of the nature of electronic transitions in D–A copolymers is widely accepted and has been built upon since, there is little experimental evidence and it is not clear whether it is generally applicable to other copolymers containing different donor and acceptor units.7,26–28
The aim of the work reported here is to experimentally test the hypothesis that donor–acceptor type copolymers based on the DPP unit have a low energy absorption band with a strong charge transfer character, and a higher energy absorption band with delocalised π–π* character. In particular, we consider the roles of these absorption transitions in photodegradation of thin polymer films.
In order to elucidate the natures of particular optical absorption transitions, we make use of the strong coupling between local vibrational modes and the electronic wavefunction (sometimes called electron–phonon coupling) observed in conjugated molecules, where electronic transitions result in geometric distortions of the molecular structure.29–31 The different distortions resulting from excitation at different wavelengths can be readily probed using resonant Raman spectroscopy. This enables us to identify the specific chemical bonds and parts of the molecular structure which are strongly affected by the electronic transition and hence describe changes in wavefunction (de)localisation on the molecule.
We consider a series of three materials (see Fig. 1) with DPP as the electron accepting unit and either selenophene or thiophene as the electron donating unit. In the case of the thiophene copolymer, the DPP unit is substituted with branched alkyl side chains, whereas in the case of selenophene both branched and straight alkyl side chains are used.32 Whilst these chemical modifications have some impact on the energies and strengths of the optical absorption peaks, we identify no differences in the character of the electronic transitions.

We find (see below) that the broad, low energy absorption band corresponds with an electronic transition localised within the DPP unit rather than a charge transfer transition from the donor to acceptor units. The low energy shoulder of this low energy band also has a contribution from aggregated material, but the associated electronic transition shows no distinct characteristics relative to the rest of this absorption band. A significantly weaker absorption band at higher energy results from a π–π* electronic transition between occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals delocalised along the conjugated polymer backbone. We also find some evidence of higher lying electronic absorption transitions with more localised π–π* character.
Finally, we investigate the photostability of the polymer under excitation at wavelengths matching either the high energy (320–520 nm) or low energy (520–1150 nm) absorption bands. Excitation with higher energy photons results in significant changes in the Raman spectrum, which we identify as disruption of conjugation in the donor (selenophene) units. Interestingly, this photodegradation process is found to be associated with a higher yield of polaron pairs arising from excitation of the higher energy transition. By contrast, no such effects are observed when the material is excited with lower energy photons (at the same intensity). The good photostability under lower energy excitation is of particular relevance to photovoltaic applications where strong optical absorption is fundamental to device function and stability is critical for practical applications. The poor photostability under higher energy excitation represents a challenge for solar cell lifetimes and warrants a more detailed investigation of its origin; in the event that it is an intrinsic instability, it might be addressed by the incorporation of alternative electron rich units.
Experimental methods
Sample preparation
The syntheses of DPPB-3Se and DPPB-3T have been described in detail previously.32,33 The synthesis of DPPS-3Se has not been previously reported and is described in the ESI.† The molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography in chlorobenzene at 80 °C and are referenced to polystyrene standards. The molecular weights are: DPPB-3Se (Mw = 210 kg mol−1, Mn = 70 kg mol−1), DPPB-3T (Mw = 170 kg mol−1, Mn = 54 kg mol−1), DPPS-3Se (Mw = 48 kg mol−1, Mn = 33 kg mol−1). The lower molecular weight of DPPS-3Se relative to the other two polymers can be ascribed to the reduced solubility resulting from the straight alkyl side chains, which leads to precipitation of the polymer during polymerisation.
Solutions were prepared at a concentration of 0.1 mg ml−1 in chloroform (1 mg ml−1 for Raman spectroscopy), stirring at 60 °C to encourage dissolution. Suprasil quartz cuvettes (1 mm light path) were used for solution spectroscopy. Thin films were spin coated on Spectrosil 2000 quartz substrates to ∼60 nm thickness, measured using a Tencor Instruments Alphastep 200 profilometer.
Spectroscopic measurements
Steady state transmittance was measured using a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Absorbance was calculated directly from transmittance (no scattering or reflection correction) based on the natural logarithm and the substrate contribution simply subtracted.
Raman spectra were measured using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope in backscattering configuration. Thin film samples were measured in a nitrogen-purged sample chamber to minimise oxidation. Several laser excitation wavelengths were used to selectively probe different electronic transitions: 1064, 785, 633, 514, 488, 457 and 325 nm. The spectrometer was calibrated for frequency using a silicon reference sample (diamond reference for 325 nm excitation). A relative instrument response calibration was achieved using a LS-1 Ocean Optics (3100 K) light source with a known emission spectrum, and the chloroform solvent peaks were used as a reference for absolute calibration. Background photoluminescence was subtracted using a polynomial fit. See ESI† for further details of this measurement.

In situ photostability studies were performed on thin film samples under nitrogen using a single laser to excite the sample and measure the Raman spectrum simultaneously. Two excitation wavelengths were used (457 and 785 nm) with comparable intensities incident on the sample (2–3 × 109 J s−1 m−2) for exposure times up to 10000 s.
The Raman-active vibrational modes discussed in this work were identified using previously published results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations with GAUSSIAN09 software.34,35 The geometry of a symmetric segment of the polymer backbone (with the alkyl side chains replaced by an ethyl fragment in order to save computational time) was first optimised then frequency analysis was performed using the B3LYP hybrid functional and the 6-311G(d,p) basis set.36–40
Transient absorption spectroscopy was carried out on thin films under nitrogen with a commercially available setup that comprises a 1 kHz Solstice (Newport Corporation) Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier with 800 nm, 90 fs pulses. The output of this laser was split into two parts that ultimately generate the pump and the probe pulses. The tunable pump pulse was generated in a TOPAS-Prime (light conversion) optical parametric amplifier and used to excite the sample. The probe light was used to generate a near-IR continuum (900–1450 nm) in a sapphire crystal. A HELIOS transient absorption spectrometer (ultrafast systems) was used for collecting transient absorption spectra (900–1450 nm) and decays up to 6 ns.
Results and discussion
Absorption spectroscopy
The absorption spectra of donor–acceptor copolymers typically exhibit two strong bands in the UV-visible range. In the case of the DPP-based copolymers, whose thin film absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 2a, there are two clear bands with the ranges 320–520 nm and 520–1150 nm referred to hereafter as the high energy and low energy absorption bands respectively. In contrast to other donor–acceptor copolymers the low energy absorption band is much stronger and broader than the high energy one, which is a preliminary indication that the traditional model describing a ‘camel-back’ absorption spectrum does not apply directly to these materials.25 In fact, the shapes of these absorption spectra are more comparable with those of simple (not D–A) conjugated polymers such as polythiophene. The absorption spectra are normalised in order to compare their shapes. Peak absorption coefficients for these films are DPPB-3Se, 1.3 ± 0.1; DPPS-3Se, 1.6 ± 0.3; and DPPB-3T, 0.9 ± 0.2 × 105 cm−1, where the slightly larger uncertainties arise from poor film uniformity, particularly for DPPS-3Se. The trend revealed is that the selenium containing polymers show stronger absorption than the sulphur containing analogue, though we note that this does not indicate a general rule for sulphur–selenium substitution.41 The spectral positions and shapes of the absorption bands also show some variation. Both polymers containing the selenophene donor unit (DPPB-3Se and DPPS-3Se) have similar positions and relative strengths for the two bands, which is understandable since the conjugated backbones are chemically identical. However, the case with the straight alkyl side chain (DPPS-3Se) has a slightly red-shifted absorption onset and the low energy absorption band has a distinct shoulder at lower energy. These features are both typical of increased polymer aggregation, and are seen more clearly in the solution absorption spectra discussed below. The thiophene derivative (DPPB-3T) has both peaks shifted towards higher energies, which is consistent with previous work showing that selenophene substitution narrows the optical energy gap in donor–acceptor copolymers.16,41,42

The absorption spectra of these three materials in solution show more clearly resolved structure (Fig. 2b) with two contributions within the broad low energy absorption band. In solution, DPPS-3Se shows a strong low-energy shoulder around 1000 nm, which is absent in DPPB-3Se, so we attribute this absorption feature to aggregation arising from the reduced solubility of the molecule with the straight alkyl chain compared with the branched alkyl side chain. We can therefore identify that the lowest energy part (950–1150 nm) of the absorption spectra for the selenophene-containing polymers corresponds with an aggregated state. The chloroform solvent contributes very small absorption features at 1150 nm and <266 nm but otherwise no appreciable absorption in the range of interest.
These simple measurements have so far identified two absorption bands: a weaker high energy band and a strong low energy band. We have also differentiated two components within the low energy band and attributed the lowest energy part to aggregated polymer. We now turn to a more advanced spectroscopy technique in order to probe the natures of these electronic transitions.
Resonant Raman spectroscopy
A strong resonant enhancement in the Raman scattering intensity occurs when the energy of the excitation photon matches the energy of a dipole-allowed electronic transition of the molecule. This enhancement is observed for those Raman-active vibrational normal modes which map onto the geometric distortion of the molecule accompanying the electronic transition.29–31 In order to elucidate the natures of the different electronic transitions we use 457 and 785 nm excitations, which selectively probe the high and low energy absorption bands of the polymers in solution, (see Fig. 2b). The measured Raman spectra for the three polymers are compared in Fig. 3. Chloroform has no Raman-active vibrational modes within the range plotted (see ESI†).

The resonant Raman spectra of conjugated molecules are typically dominated by a small number of vibrational modes describing stretches of the conjugated carbon bonds in the polymer backbone. For these DPP-based copolymers, these strong modes lie in the range 1300–1600 cm−1. All three materials show similar spectra with four particularly strong peaks labeled A, B, C and D in Fig. 3, where mode C is strong under 457 nm excitation but barely detectable at 785 nm. These peaks are centred at ∼1366, 1416, 1450 and 1510 cm−1 respectively for DPPB-3Se but slightly shifted for the other polymers. The strongest shift is observed for the 1416 cm−1 peak which lies at 1426 cm−1 in DPPB-3T indicating an increase in the effective force constant in this case. Our previous work has found that Raman peaks associated with nominally double bonds tend towards lower Raman shifts with increased effective conjugation length and molecular planarity, which suggests that the selenium substitution increases the backbone planarity and consequent conjugation; this is supported by the DFT geometry optimisation results given in the ESI.†43,44
The Raman-active vibrational modes are identified based on published descriptions and using DFT calculations of geometrically optimised molecular structures as described above.43–46 Normal vibrational modes of large molecules typically involve nuclear motion of many atoms but can be understood more simply in terms of the dominant bond vibrations. The four main modes discussed here (A, B, C, and D) are illustrated in Fig. 4 and described in Table 1. All of them are symmetric stretches of bonds in the polymer backbone but they show different degrees of localisation on particular units in the molecule. In particular we note that mode A (1366 cm−1) is localised on the DPP unit but mainly on the C–N and C–C bonds away from the conjugated backbone itself, whereas modes B and D (1416 and 1510 cm−1) correspond with stretches of the conjugated backbone bonds through the DPP unit. Mode C (1450 cm−1) is also a stretching mode of the conjugated backbone bonds but localised on the selenophene (or thiophene in DPPB-3T) ring.43–45,47

The Raman spectra measured under excitation of the high energy absorption band (457 nm) in Fig. 3a show strong contributions from modes B, C, and D, all of which correspond to symmetric stretches of the conjugated backbone carbon bonds. The resonant enhancement of these modes indicates that this high energy electronic transition has predominantly π–π* character (exchange of alternating single and double bonds) delocalised across both the donor and acceptor units, represented graphically in Fig. 5a.
 Fig. 5  Diagram indicating the natures of electronic transitions corresponding to absorption at (a) 457 nm, and (b) 785 nm. Dashed bonds (red) indicate which parts of the molecular structure experience the greatest geometric distortion during optical excitation. 
When the low energy absorption band is probed using 785 nm excitation (Fig. 3b), mode C is almost completely absent, whilst modes A and B are much stronger. The three strongest modes in this case (A, B and D) are all predominantly localised on the DPP unit. The strength of mode B (and D to a lesser extent) shows that this electronic transition also has some π–π* character, however, the weakness of mode C reveals that this transition is highly localised on and around the DPP acceptor unit. Mode A is also strongly enhanced and corresponds with bond stretches on the parts of the DPP unit away from the conjugated backbone, particularly the C–N bonds (see Fig. 4). This indicates that the electronic transition is better described as a redistribution of the electron density throughout the DPP unit, not just along the conjugated backbone. Strong coupling to Raman-active modes in the acceptor unit has been considered elsewhere as a signature of charge transfer character in the electronic transition, though in a charge transfer transition we would expect to observe resonant enhancement of the donor unit vibrational mode intensities too.26,48 The absence of mode C in this case shows that this electronic transition has minimal coupling to the geometry of the donor unit. For all three of these materials we find no evidence that the electron donating unit participates in this absorption transition so we conclude that the low energy electronic transition is best described as a redistribution of charge within the DPP unit with partial π–π* character, as indicated in Fig. 5b, rather than a charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor unit. On this basis, it may not be accurate to refer to this material as a donor–acceptor copolymer, though we retain the terminology here for the sake of clear discussion.
This result appears to conflict with other conclusions regarding the natures of the absorption transitions in DPP-based materials, and exposes some degree of confusion in published literature.7 The two absorption bands observed for DPP-based donor–acceptor molecules are well-known and the high and low energy bands have previously been assigned to a π–π* transition of the conjugated donor unit and a transition of the DPP unit respectively.17 The latter absorption band is sensitive to the properties of the donor unit and in particular shifts to low energies when conjugated with an electron-rich unit, and this effect is responsible for the low energy gaps of the materials in this study (Fig. 2). This behaviour has led to the low energy optical transition being described as an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to the acceptor unit, in line with the model proposed for other donor–acceptor copolymers.17,25 This model implies a transition between an occupied molecular orbital and an unoccupied one where one or both show some degree of localisation on part of the molecule, however, published DFT calculations for DPP-copolymers appear to conflict with this understanding, suggesting rather that both the frontier molecular orbitals have a similar degree localisation centred on the DPP unit.10,49,50 This interpretation is also supported by our own TD-DFT calculations provided in the ESI.† We note that other groups have also questioned the conventional understanding of donor–acceptor copolymers for the case of thienopyrazine, which has been described as an ‘ambipolar’ unit, and we suggest that a similar understanding might apply for DPP.51–53
In order to explore these different electronic transitions in more detail, we focus on a single material, DPPB-3Se. We have already established the qualitative similarity of all three DPP-based polymers so the conclusions are expected to retain broad applicability, but this particular class of DPP–Se polymers has shown great promise in photovoltaic and transistor applications.19,32,50,54
It was observed above that the low energy absorption peak has a contribution from an aggregated phase of molecules in the range 950–1150 nm, and there also appear to be additional higher energy transitions with wavelengths <320 nm. We explore the natures of these optical transitions, in addition to the two absorption bands already discussed, by extending the range of excitation wavelengths and using thin film samples, which are more directly relevant to device applications. The excitation wavelengths used in this case (325–1064 nm) are compared with the thin film absorption spectrum of DPPB-3Se in Fig. 6a, and the resulting resonant Raman spectra are shown in Fig. 6b normalised to the 1416 cm−1 (mode B) peak. Comparison of the Raman spectra measured using 457 and 785 nm excitation reveals no significant difference between the Raman spectra measured for thin films and in solutions.

Arrow indicates growth of 1530–1650 cm−1 scattering for shorter wavelengths. 
The 1064 nm excitation wavelength lies within the low energy absorption band but falls close to the low energy onset associated with polymer aggregation. Comparison of the three different Raman spectra measured across this broad absorption band (633, 785 and 1064 nm) allows us to investigate whether or not this aggregate absorption represents a distinct electronic transition. These spectra are compared in Fig. 6b, and show minimal difference in the relative intensities of the Raman peaks, but there is a small shift in the positions of peaks A and B by ∼3 cm−1 towards lower frequencies with reduced FWHM values. The similarity of the relative peak intensities indicates that the longer wavelength aggregate absorption has the same electronic transition character as the rest of the low energy absorption band (i.e. the same phonon modes are contributing to the transition). However, the shift in the Raman modes to lower energies with reduced FWHM values suggests an overall increase in the π-electron delocalisation along the better ordered polymer backbone.43,44 This would be consistent with a more ordered aggregate phase in which the DPP–selenophene interunit dihedral is more planar.
The 325 nm excitation wavelength lies at the cusp between the high energy (320–520 nm) absorption band and a higher UV absorption. In this case, we observe some contribution to the resonant Raman scattering from both of these electronic transitions. Comparison of the 325 and 457 nm spectra indicates that the lower energy peaks arise from the 325–520 nm absorption transition, but the new, strong feature at 1550–1650 cm−1 clearly comes from the UV absorption transition. This strong band of modes appears to become more prominent as the excitation wavelength decreases from 514 through to 457 nm. Raman-active modes of organic molecules in this energy range correspond with CC stretching modes.47 In this case the mode appears to broaden out from D, which suggests that it relates to a similar vibrational mode or a distribution of such modes. Broadening of a Raman peak towards higher energy typically indicates an increased contribution from more localised vibrational modes.44 Alternatively, it could contain asymmetric CC stretching modes of the selenophene unit, which also lie in this range.43 The frequencies of various vibrational modes of these types are predicted by the DFT calculations but their Raman activities cannot be ascertained accurately since the model neglects resonant effects. We therefore consider that this UV absorption transition arises from highly localised π–π* transitions. We note that the 325 nm Raman spectrum shows similar characteristics to the degraded sample in Fig. 7a so it is possible that rapid photodegradation contributes to the measured spectrum, though no direct evidence of this was found.

To summarise the key results established so far, the natures of the four electronic absorption transitions identified are given in Table 2.

In situ photodegradation
Having established the natures of the main optical electronic transitions, we are interested in the roles of the resulting excited states in photodegradation processes. To study these effects we measure the resonant Raman spectrum of the DPPB-3Se thin film as a function of laser exposure time using 457 and 785 nm excitations to probe photodegradation resulting from prolonged exposure to the high and low energy electronic transitions.

Fig. 7 shows the evolution of the resonant Raman spectrum during photoexcitation at 457 nm. Two effects are clearly observed: an increase in the strength of the photoluminescence background and the broadening of the 1516 cm−1 peak towards higher energy. Increasing photoluminescence is characteristic of reduced intermolecular interactions, indicating disruption in the molecular order of the polymer film.44 In order to observe the changes in the Raman scattering more clearly, this background is subtracted and the resulting Raman intensity plotted as a 2D map against exposure time (Fig. 7b). The 1550–1620 cm−1 Raman band, which grows throughout the measurement, is similar to that observed above under 325 nm excitation and is identified as a distribution of localised CC stretching modes. The 2D plot also reveals a second, faster effect: the relative intensity of the 1450 cm−1 peak increases rapidly in the first 200 s of exposure. This mode (mode C) is localised on the selenophene ring so the change in its intensity suggests that this is the part of the molecule most strongly affected in the initial stage of the degradation process. We therefore propose that the excited state formed by excitation at 457 nm is vulnerable to a photodegradation reaction on the selenophene ring (the interpretation of the increase in relative intensity of this mode is discussed in more detail in the ESI†). The degradation results in a disruption of backbone conjugation causing the observed increases in the background photoluminescence and the Raman scattering from high energy, localised or asymmetric CC stretching modes. These measurements were performed under nitrogen but this degradation occurred too quickly to measure in air, so a small amount of residual oxygen trapped in the sample might have been active in the photodegradation of the selenophene.
Repeating this experiment with the same illumination intensity but with 785 nm excitation (Fig. 8) showed minimal evidence of photodegradation. In this case there is a very slight increase in the background, though much smaller, but no variation in the shape or relative intensities of the Raman peaks. The increased background may indicate that a lesser degree of degradation does still occur, or may simply result from localised heating of the sample. In either case, it is clear that this material is much more stable to photodegradation under longer wavelength illumination. We note that the optical density of the sample is greater at 785 nm than at 457 nm (Fig. 6a) and we have considered exposure times up to 10000 s (1000 s for 457 nm) yet even under these harsher conditions we observe no change in the Raman spectrum. As described above, the higher energy (457 nm) absorption transition couples strongly to the vibrational mode localised on the selenophene unit (mode C) whereas the lower energy (785 nm) transition does not – this correlates with the observed difference in photosensitivity and is further evidence that the photodegradation mechanism occurs primarily on the selenophene unit.

Transient absorption spectroscopy
In order to investigate the wavelength-dependent photodegradation process further, sub-picosecond-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy was carried out on neat DPPB-3Se films exciting at 457 and 785 nm.
In Fig. 9a and b, we present the transient spectra following the high and low energy excitations respectively, probing in the near-IR. Both spectra present features related to (i) the ground-state negative bleaching band, from 900 to ∼1030 nm, corresponding to the depletion of the ground state upon excitation and (ii) the photoinduced absorbance of the excited state, which at early times corresponds to the exciton absorbance to upper singlet states. In the case of 785 nm excitation, this energy is sufficient for the transition to be S1 → Sn while at 457 nm is likely that the absorption observed corresponds to the transition S2 → Sn. In general it is noticed from Fig. 10 that the characteristic decay time in both cases is extremely short, with usual singlet decay times reported for other low-bandgap polymers ranging from 150 to 270 ps,55–59 with very few examples under 100 ps.60 When we analyse the transient decays of the positive band, at both excitation wavelengths, the characteristic time is τshort = 1.6 ± 0.7 ps, independently of the excitation density used. This time constant also corresponds to the recovery time of the ground state bleach at both wavelengths, which indicates that the decay of the photogenerated excitons builds the ground state population back up, however, it is important to remark that the non-existence of an isosbestic point indicates that not all of the excited state is decaying back to the ground state. The fact that the exciton decay time is so short would result in poor photovoltaic device performance for this polymer, since this characteristic time starts to compete with the typical observed exciton quenching times of a few picoseconds in polymer/acceptor blends.55,56
 Fig. 9  Averaged transient absorption (optical density) spectra of DPPB-3Se after photoexcitation at (a) 457 nm (2.713 eV) and 1.7 μJ cm−2 fluence, and (b) 785 nm (1.579 eV) and 6.5 μJ cm−2 fluence. 
 Fig. 10  Transient absorption (optical density) decay dynamics averaged between probe wavelengths 1235 and 1266 nm for 457 nm at 6.5 μJ cm−2 fluence, and for 785 nm at 1.7 μJ cm−2 fluence. Decays are independent of excitation energy density. Both traces can be fit with a monoexponential function with a 1.6 ± 0.7 ps characteristic time, but present different constant terms. Inset: an averaged decay between 1235 and 1266 nm after excitation with 457 nm at 12.5 μJ cm−2 probed with a biexponential decay with times t1 = 1.6 ± 0.7 ps and t2 = 0.6 ± 0.2 ns. 
There is one subtle but important difference in the exciton decay dynamics in the two cases. It can be observed in Fig. 9 that the spectrum measured at 50–90 ps has almost entirely decayed when exciting at 785 nm, however a significant absorbance still remains at these times when exciting at 457 nm. Based on the mono-exponential fit of the data in Fig. 10, the remaining signal accounts for 3.2% of the initial signal for the 785 nm excitation trace and 12.5% for the 457 nm one. Further studies at longer times on the remaining signal after 457 nm excitation show that it decays with a time constant τlong of 0.6 ± 0.2 ns as can be observed in the inset in Fig. 10. No signal was detected in the microsecond timescale, indicating that the signal must decay entirely in the nanosecond timescale. Because of the short time in which this signal is already present (<2 ps) and its relatively fast decay time (0.6 ns), it seems unreasonable to assign it to the presence of triplets formed via intersystem crossing.61 Rather it appears more likely that this longer lived signal results from exciton separation into polaron pairs. In the neat film, such polarons would be unlikely to escape from their coulombic attraction forces and would therefore most likely recombine geminately. It is apparent from the amplitude of this slow phase that the yield of such polarons is excitation wavelength dependent, increasing from ∼3% following 785 nm excitation to ∼12% following 457 nm excitation.
These data allow us to propose the origin of the wavelength dependent photodegradation identified above. The higher energy (457 nm) excitation results in a greater yield of polaron pairs, which could be the origin of the degradation pathway reported herein. Excitation wavelength dependent charge separation has been observed before in polymer/fullerene blends, where the additional exciton energy resulting from higher energy excitation is suggested to facilitate exciton separation.23,62–66 High energy excited states have also been reported to be involved in polaron pair generation in neat PPV films.67 It appears that, for this polymer, charge formation from the high energy (S2) singlet excited state can compete with S2 → S1 internal conversion (IC). We observe similar initial photoinduced absorption spectra for both 457 and 785 nm excitation, indicating that S2 → S1 IC occurs within our time response (<200 fs), consistent with other IC times for conjugated polymers.68 In addition, we can estimate a charge formation time constant from S2 of <2 ps based on our observation of a ∼12% charge formation yield following 457 nm excitation. A schematic depiction of the processes described here is shown in Fig. 11.

Conclusions
In this work we have tested the hypothesis that the DPP-based donor–acceptor type copolymers have a low energy absorption band with strong charge transfer character and a higher energy band with delocalised π–π* character. Our results generally support the hypothesis, though we would refine the statement as follows: the DPP-based copolymers have a low energy absorption band whose character is a charge redistribution strongly localised within the DPP unit; the higher energy absorption band shows delocalised π–π* character. Additionally we identified a contribution to the low energy absorption band resulting from polymer aggregation, which shares the same electronic transition.

In situ studies of changes in the molecular structure during photodegradation show that the molecule is very stable to excitation in the low energy absorption band, but that the selenophene unit is vulnerable to photodegradation when excited in the higher energy absorption band. This instability, which, according to our transient absorption studies, appears to be related to the formation of charges in the neat polymer, will have to be overcome in order to produce long-lived photovoltaic devices based on these materials. We suggest two possible approaches towards overcoming this photodegradation. Firstly, since we have identified the selenophene unit as the site of the degradation, exchanging this unit for alternative donor groups and testing their photostability using the methods developed in this work could prove fruitful. Secondly, the photodegradation could be avoided in a solar cell by filtering out the blue incident light (<500 nm): this would reduce the light harvesting capability of the solar cell, but in this instance the high energy absorption band is relatively weak and the solar spectrum has a relatively small component in this absorption range and so good photostability could be achieved with little loss of photocurrent generation.
These conclusions apply directly to the DPP-based polymers considered in this work, but are also expected to apply more broadly to the class of donor–acceptor copolymers. The methods developed here have widespread relevance for the vast range of conjugated molecules whose optoelectronic properties and photostability are critical for fundamental studies and device applications.

Broader context
Organic semiconductors including conjugated polymers and fullerenes continue to demonstrate promising potential for application in low-cost, printable solar cells. Power conversion efficiencies are now approaching 10%, and major attention is increasingly turning towards identifying and overcoming the degradation mechanisms that limit the device lifetime. Recent advances in the performance of organic photovoltaics have largely arisen through the development of novel molecular structures using a donor–acceptor copolymer motif. Copolymers incorporating diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units have attracted strong, widespread interest, but the main role of this unit in the optoelectronic properties and device performance is not yet clear. This work investigates the natures of the main optical absorption transitions of DPP-based copolymers and challenges the assumption that the DPP-unit behaves as a traditional acceptor unit. This insight leads to a clearer understanding of the excitation energy dependent photodegradation mechanism of the materials, providing ways to improve the operational stability of DPP-based solar cells.

 	Fig. 8  (a) Thin film Raman spectrum of DPPB-3Se excited at 785 nm showing the effect of photodegradation over 10000 seconds of exposure. (b) 2D plot of normalised Raman scattering intensity against Raman shift (abscissa) and exposure time (ordinate) after subtraction of photoluminescence background.	 

 	Fig. 9  Averaged transient absorption (optical density) spectra of DPPB-3Se after photoexcitation at (a) 457 nm (2.713 eV) and 1.7 μJ cm−2 fluence, and (b) 785 nm (1.579 eV) and 6.5 μJ cm−2 fluence.	 

 	Fig. 10  Transient absorption (optical density) decay dynamics averaged between probe wavelengths 1235 and 1266 nm for 457 nm at 6.5 μJ cm−2 fluence, and for 785 nm at 1.7 μJ cm−2 fluence. Decays are independent of excitation energy density. Both traces can be fit with a monoexponential function with a 1.6 ± 0.7 ps characteristic time, but present different constant terms. Inset: an averaged decay between 1235 and 1266 nm after excitation with 457 nm at 12.5 μJ cm−2 probed with a biexponential decay with times t1 = 1.6 ± 0.7 ps and t2 = 0.6 ± 0.2 ns.	 

 	Fig. 11  Diagram showing the photophysical processes observed upon low energy (785 nm) and high energy (457 nm) optical excitations. BPs stands for bound polarons.
