    , Accepted 3rd May 2017First published on 3rd May 2017AbstractWe have proposed a fabrication process of submicrometer-sized zinc oxide aggregates with nano/microstructures through pyrolysis of ZIF-8 particles. Methanol solutions of zinc nitrate hexahydrate and 2-methylimidazole were used for synthesizing ZIF-8 with its characteristic rhombic dodecahedron morphology. The systematic addition of 1-methylimidazole to the above methanol solutions led to the formation of size-tunable ZIF-8 particles. Precise control of heating conditions was a key to successful conversion from ZIF-8 to ZnO without destroying the morphology. The ZnO aggregates thus obtained were evaluated as photoanode materials of dye-sensitized solar cells. A photoanode using a 9 μm thick ZnO aggregate film gave a power conversion efficiency of 3.37% due to its nano/microstructures being suitable for dye adsorption, electrolyte diffusion, and light harvesting.
1. Introduction
The performance of photovoltaic devices utilizing electrochemical or photoelectrochemical reactions depends largely on the morphologies and surface structures of their electrodes.1–4 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are one of such devices, and the microstructures of photoanodes have been intensively studied on the nano- and macro-scale to enhance their power conversion efficiency. The charge separation in DSSCs is achieved by light absorption of sensitizing dyes and injection of photogenerated electrons to metal-oxide semiconductor films, followed by their transportation within the films to a collecting electrode. Therefore, the semiconductor films need to adsorb a large amount of dyes for efficient light harvesting and also work as good electron paths. Another point is that the semiconductor films should have macropores to facilitate electrolyte diffusion.5–8 Accordingly, the characteristic cell parameters, namely, the open-circuit photovoltage (VOC), short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), fill factor (ff), and power conversion efficiency (η), are greatly influenced by the microstructures of the semiconductor films.
In addition to the most typically used material, the n-type semiconductor TiO2, efforts have been made to utilize other n-type semiconductors such as ZnO. Actually, ZnO has similar bandgap energy and flat-band potential (or conduction band edge energy) to TiO2 and is promising owing to its higher electron mobility and a variety of morphologies.9–12 Many kinds of techniques have been developed so far to optimize the microstructures of metal-oxide semiconductor films through wet chemical processes. Basically, however, the evolution of any morphology is governed by a growth unit related to the crystal structure. In the case of ZnO having a hexagonal wurtzite-type structure, typical morphologies obtained by chemical solution processes are hexagonal rods,13–15 hexagonal plates,16 and hexagonal prisms.17,18
To enhance the controllability of ZnO morphologies, we have proposed the fabrication of ZnO films or particles with unique morphologies by pyrolytic conversion from morphology-controlled intermediate templates such as layered hydroxide zinc compounds19–21 and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).22 Such two-step fabrication processes via templates have an advantage of being able to design microstructures of the metal oxides on the nano- and macro-scale together. Actually we could fabricate macroporous films consisting of nanoporous ZnO sheets or nanoporous ZnO cuboids a few tens of micrometers in size, which would be difficult to obtain directly by usual solution processes.
We have focused herein on Zn-based MOFs that can have 1D to 3D structures by changing organic ligands. Various unique morphologies of Zn-based MOF particles have been reported; the rod-shaped [Zn(L-LX)(X)](H2O) (L-LX: N-(4-pyridylmethyl)-L-valine·HX) (X = Cl or Br)23 and zeolitic imidazolate framework with zni topology (ZIF-zni) crystals,24 the leaf-like ZIF-L assembled films,25 the cubic-shaped MOF-5 crystals,26,27 the polyhedron-shaped Zn(2-methylimidazolate)2 (ZIF-8) crystals,28 and so on. If these MOFs could be grown on the submicrometer or micrometer scale and pyrolytically converted into nanoporous ZnO aggregates while retaining the original morphology, they would find applications as unique semiconductor materials with large porosities and/or large specific surface areas. In DSSCs, large spherical particles have attracted attention as light-scattering centers for enhancing the light-harvesting efficiency.5,29–31 Furthermore, effective manipulation of light would make it possible to reduce the thickness of the electrodes. This is desirable for suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electrons during transportation in the electrodes. In addition, there are some reports on the fabrication of dye-sensitized metal oxide electrodes by using MOFs as morphological templates.23,25,32,33
In this report, we tried to synthesize submicrometer-sized ZnO aggregates retaining the rhombic dodecahedral morphology of template ZIF-8 particles by pyrolyzing under optimal mild conditions for DSSC application. The resultant nano/microstructures of the ZnO-aggregate films were demonstrated to be suitable for dye adsorption, electrolyte diffusion, and light harvesting in DSSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of ZIF-8 particles and ZnO aggregates
In one set of experiments, the pyrolytic conversion of ZIF-8 into ZnO was examined in detail. ZIF-8 was synthesized through a solution process, following a previous report.28 A 3.13 mmol portion of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (99% purity, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan) was dissolved in 25 mL of methanol. A 12.5 mmol portion of 2-methylimidazole (98%, Wako) was dissolved in another 25 mL of methanol. The two solutions were stored at 20 °C for over 1 h and then mixed at room temperature under stirring for 1 min. The mixed solution was kept again at 20 °C for 24 h. ZIF-8 particles that precipitated in the solution were filtered and washed with methanol. The collected particles were dried at room temperature under reduced pressure for over 12 h. For the conversion into ZnO, the dried ZIF-8 particles were heated to 400 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 and kept there for a duration between 30 and 120 min in air, followed by cooling naturally to room temperature. The particles heated for 30, 60, 90, or 120 min are sequentially designated as P-30t, P-60t, P-90t, or P-120t (P-Xt series with “P” for particle and “t” for time).
In the other set of experiments, attempts were made to control the size of the ZIF-8 particles. The amounts of the reagents were changed to enhance the size controllability. A 2.47 mmol portion of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 50 mL of methanol. A 9.88 mmol portion of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in another 50 mL of methanol. 1-Methylimidazole (98%, Wako) was further added to the 2-methylimidazole solution. The amount of 1-methylimidazole was varied between 2.47 (2-methylimidazole:1-methylimidazole = 1:0.25 in mol), 3.29 (1:0.33), 4.12 (1:0.42), 4.94 (1:0.50), and 9.88 mmol (1:1). The respective solutions were stored at 20 °C for over 1 h. The Zn(NO3)2·6H2O solution and each of the 2-methylimidazole/1-methylimidazole solutions were then mixed at room temperature under stirring for 1 min. The mixed solutions were kept at 20 °C for 24 h. ZIF-8 particles that precipitated in the solutions were filtered and washed with methanol. The collected particles were dried at room temperature under reduced pressure for over 12 h. The dried ZIF-8 particles were heated to 400 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 and kept there for 90 min in air, followed by cooling naturally to room temperature. The heated particles are sequentially designated as P-25r, P-33r, P-42r, P-50r, or P-100r (P-Yr series with “r” for ratio), referring to the above-mentioned 2-methylimidazole:1-methylimidazole ratio of the solutions used for synthesizing ZIF-8.
2.2. Fabrication of ZnO films
A 0.15 g portion of the heated particles (the P-Yr series) was added to a dispersion medium consisting of 7.5 μL of acetic acid, 0.50 mL of ethanol, and 0.25 mL of water, followed by stirring for 30 min under ultrasonication. The resultant ZnO pastes were coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass (FTO-glass) substrates (sheet resistance = 10 Ω sq−1; Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) with plastic-tape molds by a squeegee method. The coated films were dried at 90 °C for 10 min, heated to 450 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, and kept there for 30 min in air. Corresponding to the particles used, the films thus obtained are designated as F-25r, F-33r, F-42r, F-50r, or F-100r (F-Yr series with “F” for film).
2.3. Characterization
The crystal structures of the samples obtained were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) with a Bruker AXS D8-02 diffractometer. The chemical species present in the samples were examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) using a KBr method with a Bruker ALPHA spectrophotometer. The morphology of the samples was observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with a Hitachi S-4700 or a JEOL JSM-7600F microscope. The nano-scale microstructure of the samples was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with an FEI Tecnai Spirit microscope. Thermal analysis of ZIF-8 was carried out in air by thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) with a Shimadzu DTG-60 analyzer. TG-DTA curves were recorded with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 up to 600 °C. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas were determined from nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K with a Shimadzu Tristar 3000 Micromeritics analyzer. Optical transmission spectra of the films were measured with a JASCO V-670 ultraviolet (UV)-vis spectrophotometer. Diffuse reflection spectra were measured using a spectrophotometer equipped with a JASCO ISN-723 integrating sphere without using a reflector.
2.4. DSSC measurement
Photoanodes were fabricated by immersing the ZnO films in a 0.3 mM ethanolic solution of RuL2(NCS)2:2TBA (L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid and TBA = tetrabutylammonium; N719, Solaronix S. A., Switzerland) at 60 °C for 30 min. The amount of N719 dyes adsorbed on the ZnO films was estimated by measuring the absorbance of desorbed dyes. Desorption was carried out by immersing the electrodes in a 0.5 M NaOH water–ethanol (1:1 in volume) solution.
The ZnO/N719 photoanodes were assembled into a sandwich-type open cell using a platinum plate as a counter electrode and a polyester film 50 μm in thickness as a spacer. An I−/I3− redox couple electrolyte, which was composed of 0.1 M LiI (Wako), 50 mM I2 (Kanto Chemical, Japan), 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (Kanto), and 1.0 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich) in 10 mL of 3-methoxypropionitrile (Wako), was introduced between the electrodes. An active cell area was fixed at 25 mm2 by a mask. The photocurrent density (J) and photovoltage (V) of the cells were measured under AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW cm−2. A 500 W Xe lamp (Ushio UXL-500SX) was used as a light source. An AM 1.5 filter, a water filter, and an infrared cut filter (Hoya S76-HA50) were placed in the light path to regulate the light in a wavelength range of 300–800 nm, reducing the mismatch between the simulated and the natural sunlight.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. ZIF-8 particles and ZnO aggregates

Fig. 1a shows an FESEM image of the ZIF-8 particles synthesized for the examination of the ZIF-8-to-ZnO conversion. The rhombic dodecahedron morphology characteristic of ZIF-8 is observed, which agrees with that reported previously.28 The particle size is in the range between 500 and 800 nm.

In general, the pyrolytic conversion of MOFs to the corresponding metal oxides is accompanied by a large volume shrinkage due to the elimination of spatially bulky organic linkers. In many cases, therefore, any specific morphologies of MOF particles are not retained in the resultant metal oxide particles. The control over the pyrolysis is a key to achieving nano/microstructural metal oxide particles from MOFs. The thermal behavior of ZIF-8 was then examined to deduce the conditions for the pyrolysis without destroying the morphology. Fig. 1b shows the TG-DTA curves of the ZIF-8 particles recorded up to 600 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 in air. A slight decrease in weight is observed at temperatures up to 320 °C, which is ascribed to the release of residual species such as CH3OH, H2O, or NO3−. A large weight loss starts at around 325 °C and continues up to 450 °C. A strong and sharp exothermic peak at around 430 °C indicates that this weight loss is due to the combustion of the organic linkers (2-methylimidazole). The total weight loss of the ZIF-8 particles between room temperature and 450 °C is approximately 67%, which agrees well with the theoretical value of 65% in the ZIF-8-to-ZnO conversion.
XRD analysis of the ZIF-8 particles just heated up to 400 or 450 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 revealed that the conversion was remarkably promoted at this temperature range (Fig. 1c). That is, the XRD pattern of the particles heated to 400 °C still exhibits sharp peaks, which coincide with those of ZIF-8 (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre; CCDC 602542) reported by Park et al.34 In contrast, no peaks due to ZIF-8 are observed and instead broad peaks due to ZnO appear at 450 °C. From the above results, it was conceived that the temperature suitable for the ZIF-8-to-ZnO conversion would be between the start temperature (325 °C) and the end temperature (450 °C) of the pyrolysis. We then attempted to heat the ZIF-8 particles at 400 °C for a longer duration to obtain the P-Xt samples.
Fig. S1a† shows the XRD patterns of the P-30t, P-60t, P-90t, and P-120t samples that were heated at 400 °C for between 30 and 120 min. For P-30t, although the diffraction peaks are considerably weak and broad, they clearly indicate the formation of ZnO even at 400 °C. By increasing the heating time, the peaks become shaper and finally a well-defined pattern is obtained for P-120t. The progress of the pyrolysis was also investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. S1b†). ZIF-8 shows characteristic absorption bands due to the presence of 2-methylimidazole. The positions of the bands shifted and their intensity decreased in P-30t and P-60t. The bands almost disappeared in P-90t and P-120t. The appearance of the P-Xt samples is shown in Fig. S1c.† P-30t and P-60t look brown, indicative of the presence of residual organic species. In contrast, P-90t and P-120t look white. It can be concluded from these results that the ZIF-8-to-ZnO conversion is almost completed by heating at 400 °C for 90 min.
The FESEM and TEM images of the P-Xt samples are shown in Fig. 2. The initial morphology of ZIF-8 (Fig. 1a) seems to be maintained although the particle size is decreased to between 200 and 500 nm in P-30t (Fig. 2a). The shrinkage of the particles was partly associated with a large decrease in the BET surface area from 1319 (ZIF-8) to 5.5 m2 g−1 (P-30t). Because the TEM image of P-30t (Fig. 2b) does not show any nanostructures, neither the crystallization of ZnO nor the generation of pores is promoted by heating at 400 °C for 30 min. It is seen from the FESEM images (Fig. 2c, e and g) that the surface of the particles becomes granular in appearance with increasing heating time for P-60t, P-90t, and P-120t. The TEM images (Fig. 2d, f and h) indicate the progress of the crystal growth and the pore generation in P-60t, P-90t, and P-120t. In accordance with these observations, the BET surface area was increased to 13.5 (P-60t), 21.9 (P-90t), and 17.2 m2 g−1 (P-120t). The slightly decreased surface area in P-120t is related to sintering for a longer heating period. The important point here is that the rhombic dodecahedron morphology is maintained after the conversion into the ZnO particles, which are constructed from nanocrystallites with sizes smaller than a few tens of nanometers. Such particles are called “ZnO aggregates” in the present study.

The size control of the ZIF-8 particles and accordingly the ZnO aggregates is the other important issue for any of their potential applications. Actually, the size of the ZIF-8 particles could be systematically controlled by changing the amount of 1-methylimidazole as the additive to the solutions in the synthesis. Fig. 3 shows the FESEM images of ZIF-8 particles obtained from the solutions with varying 2-methylimidazole:1-methylimidazole ratios from 1:0.25 to 1:1. It is seen that all the ZIF-8 particles have a similar rhombic dodecahedron morphology. The size distribution of the ZIF-8 particles (Fig. S2†) clearly indicates that the particle size increases with increasing amount of 1-methylimidazole; it is in the range of 100–250 nm (2-methylimidazole:1-methylimidazole = 1:0.25), 250–500 nm (1:0.33), 500–800 nm (1:0.42), 700–1100 nm (1:0.50), and 3.1–3.9 μm (1:1).

In the synthesis of ZIF-8, the addition of 1-methylimidazole has been reported to influence its nucleation and crystal growth to a large extent.28 Because 1-methylimidazole (CH3C3H3N2) does not work as linkers of MOFs and yet works as ligands competitive with 2-methylimidazole (CH3C3H2N2H), the concentration of Zn2+ ions coordinated with 2-methylimidazole is lowered and hence the nucleation of ZIF-8 is retarded by the co-existence of 1-methylimidazole. The growth of the ZIF-8 crystals is adversely promoted under such conditions. The observed increase of the particle size with increasing amount of 1-methylimidazole agrees well with the above explanation.
The pyrolysis of the size-controlled ZIF-8 particles led to the formation of ZnO aggregates (the P-Yr series) also with various sizes. Fig. 4 shows the FESEM images of the P-Yr samples. The adaptation of the heating conditions examined for the P-Xt series resulted in the preservation of the rhombic dodecahedron morphology. Furthermore, a relatively narrow size distribution is attained for ZnO aggregates (Fig. S3†) with sizes in the range of 50–150 nm (P-25r), 100–200 nm (P-33r), 200–350 nm (P-42r), 250–450 nm (P-50r), and 1.0–1.2 μm (P-100r).

3.2. Photoanodes using ZnO aggregates
The pastes were prepared by dispersing the ZnO aggregates (the P-Yr series) in acetic acid–ethanol–water medium. The ZnO-aggregate films (the F-Yr series) were fabricated on FTO-glass substrates by a squeegee method with heat treatment at 450 °C for 30 min. Fig. 5 shows surface and cross-section FESEM images of the resultant ZnO-aggregate films. From the surface view, the F-25r film exhibits a densely packed microstructure. The macroscopic pores increase in size and number from the F-33r to the F-100r film. This is because the rhombic dodecahedron morphology of the respective ZnO aggregates is still maintained in the coated and heat-treated films. The thickness of all the films is approximately 9 μm from the cross-section view. However, the F-25r, F-33r, and F-42r films are not uniformly coated on the substrates, which may result from the paste composition unsuitable for the squeegee method. In contrast, the F-50r and F100r films show relatively uniform film thickness, which is more suitable for application as photoanodes.

There are many factors influencing the performance of photoanodes. In the present study, we have found that the optical properties of the films are strongly related to the light harvesting of the photoanodes. Fig. 6a and b compare the diffuse reflectance and optical transmission spectra, respectively, of the F-Yr films. In the measurement of the diffuse reflectance, the film samples were set so that light could be irradiated from the glass side, corresponding to the actual configuration of DSSCs. The F-25r film shows lower reflectance and higher transmittance in the visible region as compared to the other films. This indicates that incident light is not trapped well inside the film. The reflectance then gradually increased and the transmittance decreased in the F-33r and F-42r films probably due to a higher degree of light scattering. As expected from their microstructures shown in Fig. 5, higher reflectance as well as lower transmittance are recorded for the F-50r and F-100r films especially in the longer wavelength region. That is, ZnO-aggregate films consisting of larger ZnO aggregates and larger pores, which are comparable to the wavelength of light, promote multiple light scattering based on the Mie theory.29,30 Such optical properties are favorable to DSSCs for enhancing the light-harvesting efficiency.
 Fig. 6  (a) Diffuse reflectance and (b) optical transmission spectra of the F-Yr films. 
The photoanodes obtained by loading N719 dyes onto the F-Yr ZnO-aggregate films were assembled into DSSCs. The J–V curves of the resultant DSSCs are shown in Fig. 7a. The characteristic cell parameters and the amount of the loaded dyes are summarized in Table 1. The dye amount is larger in the F-25r film, which is due to its densely packed microstructure having a problem with the dye-loading procedure. Because N719 has carboxyl groups, the dye-loading solution becomes more or less acidic and hence dissolves a small amount of ZnO. The dissolving Zn2+ ions form Zn2+/dye aggregates, which accumulated in the pores.35 The other films showed smaller dye amounts although no clear relationship is found with the size of the aggregates. The F-25r film gives a relatively smaller JSC (8.03 mA cm−2) due to the dye-loading problem and the less light-scattering film structure. A larger JSC (9.13 mA cm−2) with the F-100r film is adversely caused by effective light scattering. Without such an effect, good cell performance would not be expected because a film with larger particles and pores generally has poor inter-particle connection. Further increasing JSC by improving the film microstructure is our current challenge.

As for VOC, a clear trend is seen among the F-Yr films: VOC increases monotonically with increasing size of the ZnO aggregates. In DSSCs, an ideal VOC is defined as the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the semiconductor and the redox potential. However, VOC is possibly lowered due to the interaction between the semiconductors and the redox electrolytes.36,37 The most important factor influencing VOC is the recombination of electrons, which are injected from the excited dyes, with oxidized species in the electrolyte.38 The suppression of the recombination therefore leads to the improvement in VOC. In the present case, the macropores facilitate the penetration of the electrolytes and hence the diffusion of the I−/I3− redox species inside the photoanodes. The dark current–voltage curves of the present DSSCs (Fig. 7b) reveal that the current is smaller at higher applied voltages especially for the cell using the F-100r film. Actually, the VOC of this cell is as high as 0.667 V, also giving the highest conversion efficiency (η = 3.37%).
There have been some reports on DSSCs using ZnO aggregates in the literature.29,39–44 The aggregates were synthesized by a polyol method,29,42 a hydrothermal/solvothermal method,39,40 or an aqueous solution method.41,43,44 The respective aggregates had similar sizes on the submicrometer scale and hence worked as the light scattering layer. On the other hand, the morphology and size of the primary ZnO nanocrystals were considerably different, which apparently affected the dye adsorption and the electrolyte diffusion. Table S1† summarizes the fabrication conditions and the performance of DSSCs using ZnO aggregates found in the literature. Our data are also included for comparison. However, it is not an easy task to compare the DSSC performance (especially the finally obtained maximum conversion efficiency) because the respective works employed different film fabrication processes, film structures, sensitizing dyes, and redox electrolytes. In addition to the microstructures of films as mentioned in the introduction, the characteristic cell parameters (VOC, JSC, and ff) are also greatly influenced by the kinds of dyes and electrolytes. Therefore, a detailed discussion based on a simple comparison of the reported conversion efficiency, which was determined using the product of VOC, JSC, and ff, is quite difficult from a scientific point of view.
Similarly to the reports by Zhang et al.29 and Zheng et al.,39 our ZIF-8-derived ZnO aggregates exhibit a comparable DSSC performance with a smaller thickness (9 μm), which is one third of those of the other reports (Table S1†). This may be due to the better packing of aggregates having a well-defined shape and narrow size distribution. Furthermore, the standard deviation of each cell parameter (Table 1) is relatively small for our DSSCs. This implies that ZIF-8-derived ZnO aggregates can provide highly reproducible photoanodes, which is of technological importance in their practical application. Because of their characteristic structural properties, it may be more effective to combine ZnO aggregates with other kinds of ZnO particles, which is now under investigation.
4. Conclusions
Nano/microstructured ZnO aggregates were obtained from ZIF-8 particles by pyrolysis at 400 °C. The initial rhombic dodecahedron morphology of ZIF-8 could be maintained in the ZnO aggregates through the precise control of the heating conditions. The size of the ZIF-8 particles and hence the ZnO aggregates could be tuned by adding 1-methylimidazole to the solutions for ZIF-8 synthesis. The ZnO aggregates were dispersed in acetic acid–ethanol–water medium and then coated on FTO-glass substrates for use as the photoanodes of DSSCs. The cells exhibited performance that depends on the size of the ZnO aggregates, with the highest power conversion efficiency of 3.37%. Our method is expected to be developed for fabricating functional nano/microstructured metal-oxide particles on the order of submicrometer to micrometers.
