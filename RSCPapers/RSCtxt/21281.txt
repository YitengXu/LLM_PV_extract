    , Accepted 31st May 2023First published on 31st May 2023AbstractHow to achieve unassisted, economical, scalable, and sustainable artificial photosynthesis for liquid fuels/products with improved solar-to-fuel efficiency (STFE) to address a carbon-neutral economy remains a big question. To a large degree, the extent of charge separation at heterojunction interfaces and charge utilization determine the STFE. Towards this, BiVO3 is assembled from ionic-precursors into TiO2 pores, and integrated structurally and electronically with TiO2 on calcination as BiVO4 quantum dots (BVQDs). BVQDs in TiO2 (BVT) pores lead to an all-inorganic system with a sub-quadrillion number of heterojunctions in a 1 cm2 device (contains ∼25 μg of BiVO4 (∼2.5 wt%) in the nanopores of ∼975 μg of TiO2 (∼97.5 wt%)) and facilitate artificial photosynthesis. We demonstrate 31–38% STFE with a photon to chemical conversion turn over frequency (ToFP2C) of 2.73 s−1 with a 1 cm2 wireless BiVO4–TiO2 artificial leaf (BVT-AL) device for HCHO and CH3OH. The sequential nature of CO2 reduction to HCHO and then to CH3OH is evident from the reaction results. 13CO2 isotopic labeling experiments confirm that the input CO2 is the source for product formation. A large increase in the photocurrent density and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of BVT, over 100% for the BiVO4 photoanode in visible light, demonstrates and supports efficient visible light absorption, charge separation and migration to the redox sites. A device has been demonstrated to show sustainable activity in direct sunlight, and addresses scalability from 1 to 9 cm2. Assuming no change (50% decrease) in the STFE, a 6.74 m2 device is expected to convert 1 (0.5) kg h−1 CO2 into C1-oxygenates in sunlight. DFT calculations carried out with anatase TiO2 (101) and BiVO4 (121) interfaces support many of the experimental findings, including electron flow from the latter to the former, and interaction of the oxygen of TiO2 with BiVO4 and vice versa at the interface towards forced heterojunctions.
Introduction
Success in visible/solar light-driven photocatalytic water splitting and artificial photosynthesis (APS) has eluded the scientific community for far too long.1–6 Like Si-photovoltaics to generate power directly, will it be possible to produce green hydrogen and/or value-added products (VAP) in sunlight from water and CO2? Can we really make an APS device with double digit solar-to-fuel efficiency (STFE), which is easy to make, economical, scalable, works unassisted in direct sunlight and exhibits sustainable activity? Although nature has provided a blueprint in terms of photosynthesis, conversion into an all-inorganic APS device is a challenging task and very limited success has been achieved so far.7,8 Two critical problems encountered in APS devices are the maximum and efficiency of light absorption from the wide wavelength range of sunlight, and minimizing the charge recombination and maximizing charge utilization through redox reactions at the co-catalyst/cathode sites. Although a number of semiconductors are available for visible light absorption, integrating them structurally and electronically in an apt manner with abundant heterojunctions is the real critical issue to achieve solar to chemical energy conversion with >10% STFE. In fact, charge conduction needs to be achieved over macroscopic distances through a 3D network of light absorbing components, which should be integrated while minimizing the defects. It is to be noted that nature has assembled organic and inorganic photosynthesis components from atomic/ionic/molecular level species in a nano-microporous architecture in a continuous and seamless manner, and adopting this principle to assemble light absorbing semiconductors is a potential approach. Furthermore, how to mimic the photosynthesis process for VAP, in an all-inorganic and sustainable system, with artificially assembled components in a device in a precisely controlled and economical process is still an open question.8
A proton-assisted CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) to produce any possible C1-oxygenates (HCOOH, CO, HCHO, and CH3OH) and water splitting to produce hydrogen occur in a narrow potential window of 230 mV between −0.61 to −0.38 V (in the NHE scale at pH = 7), apart from water oxidation at 0.81 V. Indeed, formaldehyde and methanol (MeOH) formation requires −0.48 and −0.38 V, respectively, which are just below and above the H2 evolution potential at −0.42 V, respectively.1,8 While many attempts have been made to achieve concurrent activation of water and CO2, followed by proton assisted CO2 reduction to C1-oxygenates, very few of them show promise for sustainability and scalability.9,10 Furthermore, how to increase the charge separation and charge diffusion to redox sites over macroscopic distances needs to be addressed.11–16 It is well-known that water oxidation is the overall rate-limiting step in APS due to its sluggish kinetics, and it is essential to facilitate this process to achieve >10% STFE. Redox potential requirements to generate C1-oxygenates and some of the benchmark visible light water oxidation photocatalyst systems reported for water splitting lead to few combinations. From the sustainability considerations, only oxide based systems are considered, such as TiO2, BiVO4, and WO3.17–22 Among these, TiO2 and BiVO4 exhibit comparable bulk conduction band (CB) potentials, which are suitable for CO2 reduction23–25 and H2 generation,26–28 apart from water oxidation. It is also important to completely avoid or minimize H2 generation, so that C1-oxygenates can be maximized, by choosing the right co-catalyst; this indicates the redox sites should be well-separated. BiVO4 also meets two more essential criteria of processibility into the mesopores of titania and exhibits a bandgap (Eg) of 2.35 eV and absorption around 525 nm. It is to be noted that photons around 500 ± 50 nm exhibit the highest wattage per unit area (∼1.4–1.6 W m−2 nm−1) of illumination,29 and it is prudent to make use of these photons for chemical conversion. By decreasing the particle size of BiVO4,28 it is possible to fine tune the CB potential along with the photovoltage and photocurrent, which would help to (a) achieve and fine tune the CO2 reduction to a specific product in a predominant way, and/or (b) transfer the excited electrons into the CB of TiO2. Indeed, the idea of suitably combining a wide Eg semiconductor and visible light absorbing water oxidation photocatalyst with a staggered type-II heterojunction is worth evaluating, as such a combination would meet the potential requirements of CO2 reduction.
However, the integration of BiVO4 and TiO2 with abundant heterojunctions in a seamless manner, like in a green leaf for photosynthesis, while trying to achieve all the above listed points, is a big challenge. The successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method was chosen to assemble and integrate BiVO3 from the ionic precursors in the pores of titania to form a core–shell BiVO4–TiO2 (BVT) morphology upon calcination. The synthetic strategy is designed to lead to a strong interfacial and interpenetrating interaction between the BiVO4 core and shell with an extended network of titania. BVT exhibits type-II band alignment with abundant p–n heterojunctions and helps charge separation. DFT-based models are employed to understand why the heterojunction of TiO2 and BiVO4 has demonstrated better catalytic activity than the individual TiO2 or BiVO4 systems or a physical mixture. The current manuscript addresses many of these aspects and successfully demonstrates selective artificial photosynthesis to produce MeOH and HCHO in direct sunlight with the possibility to increase the selectivity of MeOH.
Experimental
Materials and chemicals
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass slides, P25-titanium dioxide, potassium tetrachloropalladate, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), ascorbic acid, and potassium bromide were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) (Merck) ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) (Lobachemie), glacial acetic acid (Thomas Baker), ethyl cellulose and terpineol (Himedia Lab. Pvt. Ltd) were also employed.
TiO2 thin film preparation by the doctor blade method
An FTO plate was employed as conducting substrate. Initially, the FTO plate was cleaned with isopropyl alcohol followed by TiCl3 treatment on the conductive side of the FTO. P25-TiO2 paste was coated using the doctor blade method to an area of 1 cm2, and dried at 333 K for 2 h, and then calcined at 723 K for 30 min. The detailed procedure for the TiO2 paste is as follows: 1 g of TiO2 powder (Degussa P25) was stirred for 10 min with 33 mL of ethanol and 0.33 mL of glacial acetic acid, and then sonicated for 10 min. 0.5 g of ethyl cellulose was added to the above mixture with 10 min of stirring and 10 min of sonication. Finally, 3 mL of terpineol was added to the mixture, which continued to be stirred and sonicated for 30 min. After this, the solvent was evaporated to obtain a uniform thick paste. This titania paste was coated on a clean FTO plate uniformly by using the doctor blade method. The thicknesses of the films produced were in the range of 9–10 μm.
BiVO4–TiO2 (BVT) artificial leaf (BVT-AL) device preparation
BiVO4 (BV) quantum dots (BVQDs) were assembled in the mesopores of titania by following the SILAR (successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction) method. A Bi3+-ion containing solution was prepared by mixing 25 mM Bi(NO3)3 in a mixture of acetic acid and water, with a ratio of 1:19, at 298 K. Similarly, a 25 mM NH4VO3 solution was prepared by dissolving the required amount of NH4VO3 in water at 348 K.30 Both solutions were employed as precursors in the SILAR method to deposit BiVO3 QDs in the porous structure of the titania film. The pre-coated TiO2 film on the FTO was immersed in the Bi-precursor bath for 20 seconds followed by immersion in the VO3− precursor bath for the next 20 seconds. This is considered one SILAR cycle. The amount and size of the QDs in the titania film were gradually increased as the number of SILAR cycles was increased. In particular, when 10 SILAR cycles were applied to the TiO2 film, the maximum activity of the device was exhibited. After 10 SILAR cycles, the film was annealed in air at 723 K for 2 h to form uniform BVQDs in the pores of the TiO2. This procedure leads to a BiVO4/TiO2 (BVT) photoanode device. A 1 cm2 BVT-AL device contains 1 mg of photoanode material. 2.48 ± 0.3 wt% BiVO4 QDs are present in the pores of 97 ± 5 wt% TiO2. Although a small variation in weight (up to 5%) is observed from batch to batch, for all practical purposes it is considered that a 1 cm2 device contains a total of 1 mg of TiO2 + BiVO4. The weight percentage of the QDs is quantified by EDAX and weight gain analysis, before and after integration of BiVO4 in the pores. In contrast, BiVO4 was prepared directly on the FTO plate, by following the SILAR method and without any titania on it. However, this procedure leads to a large BiVO4 particle size of 1–1.5 μm. Complete details of the Pd-nanocube synthesis, material characterization methods, CRR measurements, quantification of the CRR products, calculation of the STFE, ToF and number of heterojunctions, and DFT computation are given in the ESI† (ESI-MM-SI).
Results and discussion
CRR activity
A solar light responsive artificial leaf (AL) photocatalyst device was fabricated and all the details are given in the ESI† (ESI text, MM-SI). Light absorbing QDs of BiVO4 are assembled, ion-by-ion with the Bi3+-cation from Bi(NO3)3 and the meta-vanadate-anion (VO3−) from NH4VO3 precursors, directly into the pores of TiO2 using the SILAR method. Upon calcination at 723 K, BiVO4 QDs form in the pores of the TiO2. Nanocubic Pd (PdNC) is used as a cathode co-catalyst and CRR to C1-oxygenates is demonstrated for the device with high activity and sustainability.
The photocatalytic CRR measurement was carried out with a wireless artificial leaf photocatalytic device, typically consisting of a 1 cm2 BVT photoanode (containing ∼1 mg in total of TiO2 + BiVO4) and PdNC nanoparticles (25 μg) as the cathode, and denoted as BVT-AL throughout the manuscript. A representative NMR spectrum of the product and a photo of the BVT-AL device are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (in the ESI†), respectively. The BVT-AL device performance was evaluated under one sun conditions in the laboratory and in direct sunlight. Initial experiments were evaluated in the batch mode (water saturated with CO2), and detailed studies were carried out in the continuous CO2 flow/purging mode. The latter process is termed as a continuous mode, mainly to differentiate from the batch mode experiments, and no recycling of CO2 was carried out. Product analysis was carried out periodically with HPLC and the result obtained from a typical batch process is shown in Fig. 1. The product yield, CO2 conversion and product selectivity are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The following important points are worth highlighting: (a) formaldehyde (HCHO) and methanol (MeOH) are the only C-containing liquid products observed. No other C-containing liquid/gaseous products (CO, HCOOH, CH4) or H2 were observed. A small amount of CO2 in the gas-phase was observed due to evaporation at ambient temperatures, while initial CO2 saturation was carried out at 278 K. 1H NMR experiments were also carried out with a water suppression sequence and the results are independently confirmed (Fig. S1 in ESI†). A hydrated form of HCHO (CH2(OH)2), along with methanol is detected using NMR.31 (b) The MeOH and HCHO yields were measured to be 242 and 335 μmol, respectively, after 5 h of reaction with a 1 cm2 BVT-AL device. The weight percent of TiO2 and BiVO4 were determined to be 97 ± 5% and 2.48 ± 0.3%, respectively, and the results are reproduced within a ±10% error margin with devices made from at least a dozen different batches. (c) The product yield, normalized to a 40 cm2 photoanode device (with 1 mg (2.5 wt%) of BiVO4 QDs in 39 mg (97.5 wt%) TiO2), is shown in the inset of Fig. 1a, and the normalized yields of MeOH and HCHO are 9.7 and 13.4 mmol mg−1 of BiVO4 in 5 h. (d) A linear change in the CO2 conversion and product selectivity is observed with time indicating the first order nature of the reaction. 34% of initially dissolved CO2 is converted to solar fuel/chemical in 5 h (Fig. 1b). About 45% and 20% CO2 were present in the gas-phase and aqueous phase, respectively, unconverted. (e) Interestingly, HCHO (MeOH) selectivity decreases (increases) from 77% (23%) to 58% (42%) in 5 h. This observation underlines a sequential reduction of CO2 to HCHO to MeOH (Fig. 1b). A gradual change in the selectivity also provides a handle to selectively produce either one of the products by optimizing the reaction parameters. The average rates of formation of HCHO and MeOH in the batch mode are 66.9 and 48.5 μmol h−1 cm−2, respectively. (f) O2 is the only oxidation product observed and quantified using GC. The O2 yield was observed to be 7.8 μmol h−1 cm−2, which is eighteen times lower than the expected stoichiometric amount compared to the reduction products. It is likely that electrons could be partly utilized to reduce oxygen to generate other reactive intermediates, such as hydroxyl species. In addition, some holes could be directly utilized to oxidize the liquid products, such as methanol to formaldehyde. This aspect is worth exploring with relevant in situ spectral studies to understand the mechanism. However, a similar observation has also been reported previously.9,32

The inset in (a) shows the normalized and projected activity for 1 mg of BiVO4 QDs in a 40 cm2 device. (c) CRR activity measured in direct sunlight for 7 h per day and for seven days with the same 1 cm2 photoanode device. (d) Product yield measured from CRR activity with photoanodes of 1, 4 and 9 cm2 devices measured in sunlight for 7 h. Note a linear increase in CRR activity with increasing photoanode size. 
CRR was also carried out in the continuous mode in a flow cell in direct sunlight, and the results are given in Table 1. It is observed that the continuous process leads to a rate of product formation of nearly two times higher than the batch process after the first hour of reaction, in sunlight and one sun conditions. In sunlight under the continuous flow mode, the average rates of formation of HCHO and MeOH observed (after 5 h of reaction) were 85.6 and 71 μmol h−1, respectively. A careful analysis of the rate data shown in Table 1 underlines that the continuous process enhances not only the CO2 conversion rate, but also HCHO to MeOH conversion, compared to the batch process, irrespective of irradiation conditions. It is also to be noted that sunlight enhances the rate compared to the standard one sun condition experiments carried out under typical laboratory conditions. Light flux from the sunlight plays an important role in enhancing the reaction rate. The solution temperature under reaction conditions in sunlight is observed to be 323–333 K (depending on the time of day and duration of exposure), and this enhancement in temperature is attributed to the enhanced rate observed in sunlight. Compared to the reaction carried out under ambient surrounding conditions under standard one sun illumination under typical laboratory conditions, the reaction carried out in direct sunlight results in an increased temperature due to hot weather. Although the temperature may enhance the rate of reaction, CO2 solubility in water is significantly low (∼0.75 g l−1) at 323–333 K, compared to that at 298 K (∼1.5 g l−1). In spite of that, a significantly higher CRR observed in direct sunlight demonstrates an effective conversion of CO2. A continuous supply of CO2 in the continuous mode helps to maintain reactant availability at the same level, and hence this mode shows a higher CRR rate than the batch mode. Another important observation is that the average product selectivity remains the same, irrespective of the reaction mode and irradiation conditions, indicating the reaction chemistry remains the same. The rate of CO2 conversion (and product formation) increases to 2.5 times initially (1 h) with the continuous process (337 μmol total C1-product) in sunlight compared to the batch process (134 μmol) under one sun conditions. However, it increases by 1.4 times from 577 (batch – one sun) to 786 μmol (continuous – sunlight) after 5 h of reaction. The decrease in the rate of CO2 conversion from 1 to 5 h underlines that the dissolved products might be retarding the reaction, and hence a continuous removal of the products would help to maintain the high CRR rate. On the other hand, HCHO:MeOH is found to be between 3 and 4 after the first hour of reaction, while it changes to 1.3 ± 0.1 after 5 h of reaction, irrespective of the reaction conditions. This underlines that the hydrogenation of HCHO to MeOH could be predominant over CO2 conversion to HCHO.

An additional CRR experiment was carried out with a 455 nm filter (allows λ > 455 nm) using the batch and continuous modes for 5 h, and the average rates observed are shown in the last row of Table 1. About 60% reduction in CRR was observed with the 455 nm filter, compared to the one sun conditions, in both modes, indicating the following: (a) BiVO4 remains the source of the visible light absorber and critical for CRR. (b) Significantly high activity (60% CRR) arises due to visible light absorption <455 nm by BVQDs, indicating that other factors could be contributing to the overall CRR. BVQDs of 2–5 nm observed by HRTEM, and a large IPCE (incident photon to current conversion efficiency) observed below 455 nm, shown later, fully support that BVQDs of a smaller size and their integration with TiO2 contribute significantly to the high CRR activity.
CRR sustainability and scalability
Sustainability and scalability aspects of the BVT-AL device were explored for CRR in direct sunlight and the results are shown in Fig. 1c and d, respectively. It is to be noted that many experiments were carried out repeatedly on the bright sunny days of 2019 and 2021 between 9.00 and 16.30 h. Up to 10% variation in results should be attributed to factors like variation in solar flux, and cloud cover for brief periods, and hence fluctuation in solution/catalyst temperature. While the solar power density varied between 50 and 65 mW cm−2, the solar power density considered for the calculation was 65 mW cm−2. Nonetheless, many interesting results were observed. First, continuing the reaction up to 7 h increased the methanol yield, underlining that the hydrogen utilization was preferentially for the reduction of formaldehyde. The total CO2 conversion also increased from 0.75 ± 0.05 mmol in 5 h to 0.95 ± 0.05 mmol in 7 h with the 1 cm2 device. Within an experimental error limit of 10%, reproducible results were observed for all seven days (Fig. 1c). The scalability factor was ascertained with 4 and 9 cm2 devices, prepared in a similar manner to that of the 1 cm2 device, and the results shown in Fig. 1d support this. A notable result is the near-equal selectivity of MeOH and HCHO with larger devices. In terms of the CO2 conversion, the activity was enhanced linearly to 3.3 (4 cm2 device) and 7.4 (9 cm2 device) times that of the 1 cm2 device. A linear increase in the CRR activity was assumed for an ideal device (e.g. a 4 cm2 device shows 4 times the CRR of a 1 cm2 device), and the values given are with reference to that. Compared to the 1 cm2 device, about 18% decrease in CRR was observed for both larger devices. Nonetheless, individual product rates decreased to very different levels. Calculation shows that the rate of formaldehyde formation decreased marginally to 6.2% (4 cm2) and 2.4% (9 cm2), while the rate of methanol formation decreased to 30% in devices of both sizes. This observation indicates that the first step of CO2 to HCHO conversion predominantly competes for hydrogen consumption than the subsequent hydrogenation step to MeOH with the large size devices. Indeed, it is worth exploring the reaction for larger devices and there could be a possibility of tuning the product selectivity. As in Si photovoltaics, electron collection needs to be optimized by suitable Pd-coating, and hence there is scope to tune the activity further with larger devices. In fact, this optimization would be highly relevant for larger photoanodes, however the present results fully demonstrate the potential for scaling up the devices to bigger sizes.
Isotopic labeling experiments
To confirm the source of the carbon from CO2, CRR was carried out with labeled 13CO2 (99 atom% 13C from Sigma-Aldrich) by maintaining the same reaction conditions, as in the batch mode, and the liquid products obtained were examined by GC-MS and NMR spectral methods. The results are shown in Fig. 2. The m/z = 32 and 48 peaks directly support the formation of methanol (12CH3OH) and the hydrate form of formaldehyde (12CH2(OH)2) (Fig. 2a). When 13CO2 was employed as a carbon source, methanol and the hydrate form of formaldehyde are shifted by +1 m/z values (Fig. 2b) to m/z = 33 and 49, respectively. Reshuffled relative intensities observed in the fragmentation patterns of the 12C and 13C products have been reported.33 Similarly, 13C NMR was recorded for liquid products obtained with 13CO2 and 12CO2 as reactants and by keeping the same NMR conditions (Fig. 2c). All the expected labeled products are observed: 13CH3OH at 49 ppm, the hydrate form of formaldehyde (13CH2(OH)2) at 84.6 ppm (as pure formaldehyde in aqueous solution is not detectable in NMR), the dimeric form of formaldehyde (HO(13CH2O)2H) at 89.4 ppm34 (the same as detected in the MS signal at m/z = 80 in Fig. S3†) and dissolved CO2 remaining after 5 h of reaction at 124.6 ppm were detected, while no products could be observed with 12CO2, as they all contain NMR-inactive 12C nuclei (inset of Fig. 2c). 13C-containing products were analyzed by 1H NMR (with water suppression) for cross-verification, and the results are shown in Fig. 2d–f. Fig. 2e shows an enlarged view of the 1H NMR spectra of the hydrate (4.71 ppm) and dimeric (5.01 ppm) forms of formaldehyde.34 While a single peak is observed with 12CO2, fully split peaks are obtained due to coupling of 13C and protons. Similarly, the 1H NMR spectrum of 12CH3OH shows a single peak at 3.36 ppm, but this is split into two peaks with the 13C counterpart. Isotopic labeling experiments fully support that the source of carbon in the present APS is from the input CO2 only, and not due to any contamination. 1H NMR quantification shows 63 and 50 μmol h−1 cm−2 of H13CHO and 13CH3OH, respectively, which are comparable to those obtained with 12CO2 (Table 1) using the batch mode under one sun conditions.

Solar to fuel efficiency
STFE was calculated from the chemical energy output and energy input and the detailed procedure is given in the ESI.† The average rates of MeOH or HCHO formation observed experimentally in direct sunlight using the batch and continuous modes were employed for the STFE calculations (Table 1). STFE values of MeOH were observed to be 15.3 and 19.4% for batch and continuous-mode measurements, respectively. This is in line with the thermodynamic limit of STFE for single junction solar cells to methanol of around 24%.8b Nonetheless, many of the CRR PEC systems reported show more than a single product.1,8–10 Since HCHO gets converted to methanol, in terms of CO2 conversion to VAP, both products are considered to be equal in the current BVT-AL. This leads to total STFE values of 31.1 and 38.2% in the batch and continuous modes, respectively. The total formation rate of C1-oxygenates (MeOH and HCHO) observed between 134 (batch mode) and 337 μmol cm−2 h−1 (continuous mode) in the first hour of the experiment with the 1 cm2 BVT-AL device (Table 1) translates into 134 to 337 mmol h−1 with 1 g of photoanode material (975 mg TiO2 and 25 mg BiVO4) spread over a device area of 1000 cm2. However, normalization to 1 g of BiVO4 (in a 4 m2 device) from ∼2.5 wt% BiVO4 QDs in a 1 cm2 device indicates the activity to be 13.5 moles of CO2 (596 g) conversion to C1-oxygenates by the continuous mode in sunlight. It is assumed that the activity remains the same at 1 cm2 and 4 m2. It is again reiterated that this activity enhancement is due to the QD form of BiVO4 assembled and electronically and structurally integrated in the pores of the titania.
A comparison has been made in Table 2 for the CRR results obtained under somewhat different conditions with top-performing catalysts.9,24,35–38 It is to be noted that the first,35 second36 and fourth38 row results are obtained with a UV light source. Wu et al.,9 Gao et al.24 and Gondal et al.38 have reported selective methanol formation from the CRR. Wu et al.9 reported the highest normalized methanol yield (1.2 mol h−1 g−1) using Cu2O as a catalyst in powder form. It is to be noted that a tremendous reduction in efficiency and yield is observed with relatively large quantities (even with a doubling of the catalyst quantity from 75 to 150 mg) of the particulate photocatalyst.39 A recent review on solar hydrogen generation also highlights a large decrease in activity with an increasing amount of photocatalyst from 1 mg to higher levels (10–100 mg) in a powder suspension, as light penetration is increasingly blocked by increasing the amount of catalyst, limiting any practical application at a large scale.40 Current results show 4–5 orders of enhanced CRR activity with BVT-AL. CO2 conversion per g (or 7 mmol) of Cu2O was reported to be 1.2 mol h−1,9 while CRR is 13.5 mol h−1 with 1 g (or 3 mmol) of BiVO4. It is also to be noted that the molecular weight of Cu2O (143.1 g) and BiVO4 is 324 g. This underlines that a smaller mole percent of BiVO4 is sufficient to achieve a high CRR, due to the confinement of BVQDs in the pores of the TiO2. This underlines the uniform distribution of BVQDs. Even if the STFE at a large scale (say 1 sq. ft) decreases to 50% of that of 1 cm2, the present results would be higher than the activity reported earlier. Control experiments were carried out and the results shown in Fig. S4† reiterate that BiVO4 QDs are critical for light absorption and the heterojunction with TiO2 is necessary for electron–hole pair separation.

b 1 mg photoanode material (97.5 wt% TiO2 + 2.5 wt% BiVO4) spread over a 1 cm2 area and activity measured with a thin film form, while all other reports involved powder suspension. The normalized yield to 1 g of total photoanode material can be obtained by simple multiplication of 1000 by the existing results of the BVT-AL batch and continuous processes (last two rows in this table).
c Activity normalized to 1 g of photoanode material (TiO2 + BiVO4) spread over a 1000 cm2 area is 157000 μmol h−1; activity normalized to 1 g of BiVO4 in 39 g of TiO2 (total 40 g of photoanode material) and the device spread over 4 m2 would produce (or convert) 13.5 mol h−1 of C1-oxygenates (CO2), which is at least an order of magnitude higher than any previously reported value. When the Pd-co-catalyst weight is also included in the CRR calculation, which is 25 μg cm−2 and 1 g per 4 m2 device, along with the BiVO4 weight, the rate decreases to ∼6.6 mol h−1, which is still higher than any previously reported values.

Optical absorption and band-gap
The optical absorption of the photoanodes was measured by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 3a), and the Eg value was calculated using a Tauc plot using the Davis–Mott relation (Fig. 3b). The inset in Fig. 3b shows a digital photograph of the representative photoanodes for the associated color change. The absorption onsets of TiO2 and BiVO4 occur at ≤385 (Eg = 3.24 eV) and ≤525 nm (Eg = 2.36 eV), respectively, while the BVT photoanode displays light absorption ≤490 nm (Eg = 2.53 eV). Skewed light absorption (especially for TiO2) observed at high wavelengths is mainly due to the contribution from the FTO plate. The uniform greenish-yellow color observed for bulk BiVO4 changes to a bright yellow color in BVT, and a significant change in the color underlines the quantum size effect of BiVO4 in BVT with an increase in Eg. This suggests an electronically integrated nature of BiVO4 and TiO2 in BVT. This observation reiterates the diffusion of ionic precursor components (Bi3+ and VO3−) of BiVO4 into the pores of TiO2 by the SILAR method. Only upon calcination are the assembled precursors converted to BVQDs in the TiO2 pores. The integration of QDs in the pores ensures the formation of a heterostructure with a core–shell morphology with possible BiVO4 protrusion into TiO2 and electronic integration.
 Fig. 3  (a) UV-visible absorption spectra of photoanodes. The corresponding Tauc plot is shown in (b). The inset in (b) shows a digital photograph showing the color associated with the photoanodes. Note the bright yellow observed for BVT due to the quantum size and pore-confinement effect. 
Structure, nano-architecture and textural properties
The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern was recorded to study the crystalline structure associated with the BVT photoanode. Fig. S5 (in the ESI†) shows the PXRD of TiO2, bulk BiVO4 and BVT. Bulk BiVO4 indicates the monoclinic phase, and this is verified using JCPDS data 00-014-0688. The dominant peaks of bulk BiVO4 appear at 2θ = 15.2, 28.85, 30.5 and 35.2°, representing the (020), (121), (040) and (002) facets, respectively. Many facets observed in bulk BiVO4 and shown in the JCPDS data are not observed in BVT, indicating specific interaction(s) of the BiVO4 guest in the confined pores of the host TiO2. In particular, the most intense (121) facet is shifted by 0.45° to 2θ = 29.21° in BVT (28.76° with bulk BiVO4), indicating a significantly compressed BiVO4 lattice along the (121) facet. Comparatively smaller shifts for the (200) and (002) facets are also observed, but with marginal expansion. These observations suggest that interaction to a minor extent with other facets cannot be ruled out. It is to be noted that Bi3+ and VO3− are integrated into the titania pores, and BVQDs form only upon calcination, and get compressed due to pore confinement. It is known that oxygen is doubly coordinated on the surface of tetragonal anatase TiO2 (101) and monoclinic BiVO4 (121) facets, however, four coordinated Bi and V on the (121) facet (in contrast to BiO8 dodecahedra and VO4 tetrahedra in bulk) fully favor the interaction between the lattices.41 It is likely that low coordinated oxygens of TiO2 on the inner-surfaces of the pores could interact with assembled BiVO3 in them and could compress further during calcination, possibly leading to charge transfer to TiO2. This aspect was explored by XPS, and the V 2p core-level shows only V5+ in BVT, while V5+ and V4+ are observed in the bulk BiVO4 (Fig. S6 in ESI†). This underlines that charge transfer occurs from BiVO4 to the TiO2 lattice, paving the way for the facile charge transfer. This, along with the high CRR activity, suggests that the defective sites at the BV and TiO2 interface are likely to be passivated to a large extent. This is further supported by the DFT calculations, and this is discussed later. No significant change in the Ti 2p3/2 (458.7 eV) and Bi 4f7/2 (159 eV) core level BEs were observed between BVT and BiVO4. Despite being at 2.5 wt%, only low index facets of BiVO4 were observed (Fig. S5†) in the current BVT-AL device. DFT calculations40 also show that low-index facets exhibit the same Eg values (2.9–3.0 eV) and similar electronic structures for monoclinic BiVO4. The VB energies of all four facets meet the water oxidation potential and are hence predicted to be good for water oxidation. Indeed, it is known that BiVO4 is a water oxidation catalyst.19,20,27 However, the lack of H2 observed in the products demonstrates the full utilization of H+ and e− for CRR at the co-catalyst sites.
Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was employed to image the distribution of all three cations of BVT and a set of representative results are shown in Fig. S7.† A nearly uniform distribution of Bi and V is evident from the results shown, particularly in the porous layers, edges and periphery of the titania particles. To explore the microstructural and particularly heterojunction aspects of BVT, it was subjected to TEM/HRTEM and the representative results are shown in Fig. 4. While virgin TiO2 shows plain and uniform grey contrast particles (Fig. 4a), BVT exhibits TiO2 pores (Fig. 4b) filled with BiVO4. The dark contrast underlines the assembled BiVO4 in the mesopores of titania. Indeed, the assembly of BiVO4 QDs is observed uniformly in the mesopores of TiO2, indicating that it is distributed over the entire thickness of the film. HRTEM shows that BiVO4 QDs are spherical in shape with particle sizes in the range of 3–5.5 nm (Fig. 4c). HRTEM demonstrates a distinct heterostructure formation between BiVO4 and TiO2 due to the confinement of the former in the pores of the latter, and the SILAR method facilitates the assembly of the BiVO4 QDs systematically. The BiVO4 QDs show a d-spacing of 0.309 nm, corresponding to the highly abundant (121) facet. The TiO2 particle size was observed to be ∼20 nm with the majority of particles displaying a d-spacing of 0.345 nm, corresponding to the (101) facet of anatase. TEM studies fully support the diffusion of Bi3+ and VO3− precursors into the pores of TiO2 and thus BVQD formation on calcination. In fact, the (121) facet of BiVO4 compression occurs due to the change from BiVO3 to BiVO4 on calcination and a subsequent strong host–guest interaction along the inner pore-walls of the titania. This is also evident from the blurred fringes of titania observed in the HRTEM images shown in Fig. 4d and e. These facts underline an interpenetrating interaction of BVQDs and TiO2, especially at the interface, highlighting the structurally integrated nature while minimizing defects. XPS recorded for the V 2p core level of BVT also supports the charge transfer from BiVO4 to titania in the BVT (Fig. S6†). The smallest mesopores (2.5 ± 0.5 nm) filled with BV were also observed (Fig. 4f) indicating that micropores of less than 2 nm could also be occupied by BiVO4, although BiVO4 filled micropores could not be observed. An HRTEM image of the bottom right corner of Fig. 4f is shown in Fig. S8.† The bright yellow color observed with the BVT photoanode fully supports the possibility of the filling of the micropores with smaller particle sizes of BiVO4. Different BV particle sizes (between 2 and 5.5 nm) observed in the HRTEM studies indicate some similarity of BVT with a multijunction or tandem solar cell. Although BV remains the visible light absorbing material, multiple band gaps are possible due to the variation in particle size,42 and hence the absorption of corresponding smaller wavelength (or higher energy) photons is possible. Indeed, this is likely to be a reason for the larger extent of photon to electron conversion, and hence improved CRR activity. In addition, excess energy associated with the charge carriers would lead to significantly higher photovoltages/photocurrents. However, more systematic and controlled work with uniform pore size TiO2 is required to confirm these aspects.
 Fig. 4  TEM images of (a) TiO2 and (b) BVT photoanode (scale bar is 20 nm). (c) TEM, and (d and e) HRTEM of BVT demonstrate the BiVO4 confined in TiO2 mesopores and abundant heterojunctions among them. The area in the black square shown in panel (b) is shown in (c). The dark contrast and d-spacing confirm the presence of assembled BiVO4 in the TiO2. TiO2 interlayer spacing can (cannot) be clearly seen for empty (filled) pores of titania, and it characterizes the interaction among them. The uniform filling of small pores (∼2–3 nm diameter) with BiVO4 can be seen in (f). An HRTEM image of the bottom right corner of panel f is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). 
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore-size distributions of BVT and TiO2 are given in Fig. S9 (in ESI†). BET results (Fig. S9a†) of P25-TiO2 (BVT) show a surface area and pore volume of 58 (54) m2 g−1 and 0.18 (0.16) mL g−1, respectively.43,44 Similar adsorption patterns and pore size distributions in both cases reiterate that the titania contribution remains high. The contribution to the total pore volume is more from the mesopores (>2 nm) than the micropores (<2 nm) in TiO2 as well as BVT. A small but significant decrease in the pore volume of BVT, compared to TiO2, is evident from the above results, which is attributed to the occupation of pores by BV QDs. A decrease in the mesopore volume of 4 nm and 2–3 nm pores is directly evident from Fig. S9b.† Since the BVQDs are confined to the TiO2 pores, as shown in the TEM results (Fig. 4), an attempt has been made to calculate the number of heterojunctions with few, but valid, assumptions. To simplify the calculation of the number of heterojunctions, and as observed in the significant reduction of pore volumes of 2–3 and 4 nm pores (Fig. S9b†), it is presumed that TiO2 contains only 2.5 and 4 nm diameter pores in the ratio to accommodate 20:80 weight percent of BiVO4 and distributed throughout the BVT-AL device. Additionally, one heterojunction/filled pore (or BiVO4 particle) is assumed. From the unit cell volume of monoclinic BiVO4, it is calculated that each 4 nm (2.5 nm) pore is packed with 108 (26.47) BiVO4 unit cells. It is to be noted that the titania film was calcined after the doctor-blade procedure at 723 K for 30 min, and BVT was calcined at 723 K for 2 h. Calcination alone is expected to show a marginal reduction in the surface area and pore volume due to the possible extended network of TiO2, nonetheless, importantly, the extended network is likely to help charge diffusion over macroscopic distances. More details of the calculations are given in the MM-SI.†
The present calculation suggests that 174 trillion heterojunctions are possible in a 1 cm2 device with 1 mg of BVT material. It is to be noted that micropores and partially filled mesopores are not considered for the present calculation. Indeed, more than one heterojunction is possible with filled mesopores. Further, pore volume reduction in the micropores of BVT, compared to TiO2 (Fig. S9†), indicates a possible filling of many micropores. Indeed, this is directly supported by the HRTEM results shown in Fig. S9.† Although the latter two points are not accounted for in the present calculations, it is easily possible that the number of heterojunctions present could be 0.5–1 quadrillion in number, which needs to be verified. Although not observed in TEM, a small amount of BiVO4 deposition on external surfaces of TiO2 cannot be ruled out, and this is likely to add more heterojunctions. Such a large number of quadrillion heterojunctions is possible exclusively due to the SILAR method employed for assembling the BVQDs. This is further supported by the Nyquist plot from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measured for TiO2 and BVT, and the results are shown in Fig. S10.† More efficient charge transport occurs across the BVT and electrolyte solution interface than with the parent TiO2. A smaller arc observed with BVT accounts for the strong electron transport ability. Indeed, it is also interesting to note that only 3.2% of the available mesopores are filled with BiVO4, and there is a large scope to increase the BiVO4 content, by suitably modifying the synthetic strategy.
Uniform heterostructures of BV and TiO2 are observed over the entire BVT film thickness, which helps in electron–hole pair separation and dispersion of charge carriers to the redox sites. Effective charge separation at the heterojunctions and hence low recombination in the depletion region are critical for water splitting. Holes react with water on the surface of the photoanode and split water as the first step to generate O2, electrons and H+. CO2 reduction to an anion radical of CO2 is highly unlikely, as the reduction potential required is high at −1.9 V, and the CB edge of BVT does not meet this requirement. CO2 reduction occurs on the Pd-nanocube co-catalyst with electrons and H+, supplied from the first step. TEM of the cathode material Pd was recorded and the results are shown in Fig. S11.† Pd nanoparticles of 8–9 nm exhibit nanocube morphology. When the Pd-nanocube was replaced with Pd-nanoparticles of random morphology of size 4–6 nm, a drastic reduction in photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to methanol and formaldehyde was observed. The same experimental conditions as those for the results shown in Fig. 1b were applied with the BVT-Pd-nanoparticle system, but only 13.8% CO2 conversion was observed in 5 h with the Pd-nanoparticles, against 34% conversion with Pd-nanocubes. However, the methanol and formaldehyde selectivities observed are very similar to those of the Pd-nanocubes. Approximately 59% decrease in CO2 conversion was observed with Pd nanoparticles of random morphology (compared to Pd-nanocubes), underlining the critical role of (100) faceting of the Pd-nanocubes for high CO2 conversion. When Pd was replaced with Ni5Cu2.5 (alloy),16 methane was observed predominantly. Few other co-catalysts have also been evaluated, and the CRR products change depending on the co-catalyst. These observations reiterate that CO2 reduction occurs on the co-catalyst site. More work is in progress in this direction.
Light to electrons and CRR mechanism
The high CRR activity observed along with the prediction of a quadrillion number of heterojunctions are expected to be reflected significantly in the photocurrent density measurements of BVT. Fig. 5a shows the results obtained from the photoelectrochemical study carried out to explore the light response with BVT, BiVO4 and TiO2 photoanodes at an applied potential of 1.23 V (vs. RHE) under one sun illumination. In the transient photocurrent measurements recorded, in the presence of light and in the dark, the BVT photoanode exhibited a higher photocurrent density than BiVO4 and TiO2. Interestingly, bulk BiVO4, where 100% BiVO4 (∼1.4 mg cm−2) is present, shows a photocurrent density of 87 μA cm−2, while BVT, which contains only 2.5 wt% BVQDs along with 97.5 wt% TiO2, shows a photocurrent density of 137 μA cm−2. This result fully supports efficient charge separation at heterojunctions as well as the high water oxidation activity observed. In addition, linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) results were recorded with the Pd-nanocube co-catalyst under electrochemical CRR conditions with CO2 saturated aqueous solution (pH = 6.84), as well in N2 saturated aqueous solution (pH = 7.90), and the results are shown in Fig. 5b. Electrochemical CRR with the PdNC co-catalyst shows the lowest onset potential at 0.02 V, while it shifts to 0.25 V in N2-saturated solution. Similarly, a 1.1 mA cm−2 current density was observed in CO2 saturated electrolyte at 0.4 V, while only 0.2 mA cm−2 was observed with N2-saturated solution. Indeed, these observations fully demonstrate that the catalytic activity of CRR arises from the Pd-co-catalyst. These results directly correlate to the high CRR activity observed with BVT-AL, as photogenerated electrons from BVQDs are transferred to the Pd-cocatalyst through the highly interconnected titania network.
 Fig. 5  (a) Photoelectrochemical studies to show the transient photocurrent response, in the presence and absence of light, for understanding the light driven current generation ability of the photoanodes. (b) Linear sweep voltammogram recorded under electrochemical CRR conditions shows a high current with the Pd-nanocubes, while the same in an N2 atmosphere shows a poor current. (c) Wavelength dependent IPCE performance of the BiVO4–TiO2, BiVO4 and TiO2 photoanodes are shown. An enhancement factor of 5–7 was observed with BVT compared to the parent BiVO4 over the visible light absorption regime, reiterating the role of the integrated 2.5 wt% BiVO4 QDs in titania in improving the current and hence the overall CRR activity. Integrated currents obtained from IPCE for the photoanodes are given in the inset. 
Wavelength dependent IPCE was also measured for BVT and reference photoanodes (BiVO4 and TiO2), and the results are shown in Fig. 5c. The inset in Fig. 5c shows the current density obtained from the integration of the IPCE results. Batch type CRR conditions (with saturated CO2 in water) were employed for the IPCE measurements at 298 K, at no applied potential. Marked increases in the IPCE values for BVT compared to the BV photoanode are observed over the entire visible light wavelength range measured. Above 540 nm, a gradual decrease in the IPCE value was observed with the BVT photoanode. As expected, titania exhibits negligible IPCE values in the visible light regime. While parent BiVO4 shows about 6–6.5% IPCE values up to 440 nm, thereafter they decrease rapidly at higher λ. It is to be noted that pure BiVO4 prepared by the SILAR method shows a large particle size (1–1.5 μm) and it represents bulk BiVO4, and low IPCE values above 460 nm suggest high recombination of charge carriers. The following points about the IPCE results are worth underlining: (1) an increase in IPCE values from 460 (∼13%) to 410 nm (∼31%) directly indicates that the smaller BiVO4 QDs contribute more to the photocurrent generation and hence to the overall CRR activity. More importantly, all photon wavelengths between UV and 540 nm contribute effectively to the CRR activity. This is in good correspondence with the CRR results obtained with a 455 nm filter (Table 1). (2) The smaller the size of the BiVO4 QDs, the higher the IPCE value, suggesting the possibility of filled micropores of 1–2 nm diameter, with significantly larger band gaps. A significant number of empty micropores (especially ∼2 nm pores) observed in the pore-size analysis (Fig. S9†) of the parent P25-TiO2 get filled with BVQD, as has been identified in HRTEM (Fig. 4 and S8†), and a large amount of visible light absorption was observed in Fig. 3, fully supporting this. Although the BiVO4 photo-absorber remains the same in the present system, the effective absorption of visible light over a large λ range due to a BVQD particle size of 1–5.5 nm makes it more than a single junction cell. This is further substantiated by the average of the first order differential values calculated for the 410–430 and 490–510 nm ranges from the integrated IPCE plot shown in the inset of Fig. 5c. A steep rise in the integrated IPCE current for 410–430 nm leads the above-mentioned value to be 0.0490, while for 490–510 nm it is 0.0127, which is four times lower. This indicates the shift of the CB potential of smaller size QDs (1–3 nm) to more negative values, which is expected to generate high current and potential, which is due to quantum confinement effects. (3) Critically, high IPCE values observed with BVT photoanodes underline the charge separation and charge diffusion over macroscopic distances, which is a key reason for high CRR activity. Indeed, the high external quantum efficiency (EQE) obtained directly from IPCE underlines the efficient conversion of visible light photons into charge carriers. (4) A decrease in IPCE between 460 and 480 nm possibly indicates the absence of a certain particle size of BiVO4, due to the non-availability of certain pore sizes (4–5 nm) to accommodate it. It is very likely that micropores are fully-filled quickly with BVQDs in the SILAR process, followed by mesopores. (5) The current density calculated from the IPCE results shows a marked increase in BVT over the 100% parent BiVO4 photoanode. It is also to be reiterated that only 2.5 wt% of BVQDs is present in the BVT, while the entire material is BV in the parent BiVO4. This point underlines the fact that the efficacy of charge separation at the heterojunctions is a critical factor, and charge migration is due to structural and electronic integration in BVT.
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was measured with monochromatic light at different wavelengths, namely 410, 440 and 490 nm. AQE measurement and calculation details are given in the ESI† (MM-SI ESI text; Section e). The AQE results calculated are 13.0, 8.7, and 8.1% for 410, 440 and 490 nm, respectively. The AQE results obtained are in line with the IPCE results, and a significant enhancement in the AQE observed at 410 nm reiterates the predominant role of the smallest size BVQDs in energy harvesting.
The key steps in the photocatalytic process are the adsorption and activation of water and CO2 molecules, and electron–hole pair generation and separation upon light absorption by BVT-AL.45 Abundant heterojunctions of BV and TiO2 help in electron–hole pair separation as well as dispersion of electrons to the Pd-cathode, and a possible mechanism is shown in Fig. 6a. The valence band (VB) energy positions were obtained from X-ray VB photoelectron spectra of TiO2 (VBMax = 2.98 eV) and BVT (VBMax = 2.07 eV) (shown in Fig. S12 in the ESI†). The addition of the band gap values (3.24 eV for TiO2, and 2.53 eV for BVT), obtained from the Tauc plots (Fig. 3), provide the conduction band positions of TiO2 (−0.26 eV) and BVT (−0.46 eV). A shift in the VB edge of BVT by 0.9 eV to higher energy, compared to TiO2, reiterates the electronic integration of BiVO4 in the nanopores of TiO2. Nonetheless, as indicated by the various results (Fig. 5 and AQE), smaller BVQDs contribute more effectively to charge separation by generating higher photovoltage and photocurrents, due to significantly higher Eg, and this is schematically shown in Fig. 6b. As explained by the IPCE and AQE results, due to the quantum confinement effect the BiVO4 QD band gap increases with a decrease in the BVQD size, and the same leads to a shift in the conduction band potential to more negative values. This is directly supported by the increasing IPCE values at lower wavelengths of visible light, and the 60% reduction in CRR rate observed with the 455 nm cut-off filter. Nonetheless, as the present system consists of a range of QD sizes (1–5.5 nm), an overall effect of an increase in efficiency is observed, but it is difficult to identity the BVQD size and λ correlation. It is worth exploring the effect of the uniform size BV QDs integrated in the TiO2 with the same size nanopores (say 2 nm). Photoexcited electrons and protons are captured concurrently by adsorbed CO2 to form formaldehyde and then methanol. Some intermediates cannot be ruled out, although none of them are observed. It is to be underlined that no H2 is observed in the present reaction, and this hints at the possibility of complete utilization of protons for CRR in a sequential manner. The accumulated electrons on the Pd-cathode react with adsorbed CO2 in the presence of H+, leading to formate formation followed by HCHO formation.46–48 Furthermore, subsequent addition of H+ and electrons to HCHO produces the methoxy intermediate followed by methanol.48

Note that the scheme shown in panel (b) uses an arbitrary scale, mainly to show the quantum size effect of BVQDs on light absorption and charge separation/injection into TiO2. 
Computational results
As shown by the XRD and TEM results, the most dominating heterojunction interaction is through anatase TiO2(101) and monoclinic BiVO4(121) facets, and these have been modeled and evaluated (Table S1 in ESI†) for understanding the underlying electronic structure aspects. Computational details can be found in the ESI.† The BiVO4(121)/TiO2(101) system has been modeled by adsorbing BiVO4(121) over TiO2(101), and this heterojunction is referred to as BVT-HJ. A schematic representation of the side view of BVT-HJ is shown in Fig. 7a. On TiO2(101), H2O is activated by 2%, whereas it is enhanced to ∼8% over BiVO4(121) (refer Fig. S13†). This supports the predominant water oxidation on the latter, which is, in fact, observed experimentally and theoretically.41 Next, the adsorption of H2O was examined over BVT in the presence and absence of CO2. H2O is chemisorbed in both cases with ∼4% elongation of O–H (Table S2, Fig. S14(a) and (b) in the ESI†). The adsorption of H2O also leads to surface reconstruction. Although no signs of H2O dissociation were observed, in the presence or absence of CO2, the strong interaction between the surface oxygen (of BiVO4 of BVT-HJ) and H indicates the possibility of O–H bond cleavage at room temperature. Further, CO2 does not activate over BVT-HJ, when adsorbed alone or co-adsorbed with H2O (Fig. S14(b and c)†). CO2 is physisorbed at >3.0 Å from the surface with the ∠OCO bent by 2° (Table S2†).
 Fig. 7  (a) Schematic representation of the side-view of BVT-HJ formed by adsorbing BiVO4(121) over TiO2(101). At the heterojunction, the V and O ions of BiVO4(121) coordinate with the O and Ti ions of TiO2(101), respectively. The formation energy (Eform) of the BVT system is −1.35 eV, underlining its thermodynamic stability. (b) A close-up view of the BVT heterojunction showing the direction of charge transfer. From the Mulliken charges reported in Table 3 and Fig. S15,† it is observed that the TiO2(101) surface ions have more charge when the BVT heterojunction is formed. At the same time, a loss in the charge of the V ions is observed. Hence, a facile flow of charge is expected from BiVO4(121) to TiO2(101) across the junction. To aid the eye, the oxygens of BiVO4 and TiO2 are represented by dark red and red colors, respectively. Bi = violet, V = grey, Ti = blue. 
Next, we investigated the interaction of CO2 with Pd(100), TiO2(101), and Pd(100) supported on TiO2(101). CO2 was physisorbed on bare Pd(100) and TiO2(101) with Eads calculated to be −0.35 and −0.34 eV, respectively, and showed no significant difference in adsorption. Meanwhile, it chemisorbs on Pd(100)/TiO2(101) with Eads = −0.69 eV (Fig. S15 and S16 in ESI†). The C–O bond gets activated by ∼7%, thus elongating from 1.18 Å (in gaseous CO2) to 1.22 and 1.26 Å on Pd(100)/TiO2. The Pd(100)/TiO2(121) Schottky junction is also accompanied by the surface reconstruction of Pd(100). Upon reconstruction it closely resembles the Pd(111) facet, and the magnitude of reconstruction is enhanced when CO2 chemisorbs (Fig. S17†).
In Table 3, we report the Mulliken charges on the ions at the interface. It is evident from Table 3 that the average charge on the Ti in the top layer and O ions at the heterojunction is greater than for the TiO2(101) surface. At the BVT-HJ, oxygen coordination (of TiO2) increases from 2 to 3, and this not only results in an increase in charge, but the total electronic integration of the BVT. The adsorption of BiVO4 over TiO2(101) leads to significant surface reconstruction due to the formation of the heterojunction and hence charge redistribution is observed. It is observed that some V ions in the first layer show a loss of charge (marked by a red color in Table S3 in the ESI†), while others donate less charge compared to the BiVO4(121) system. V ions at the second and third layers of the BVT show a greater loss in charge than in BiVO4(121) (refer to Fig. 7b and Table S3†). Additionally, except for layers at the interface (i.e. the top layer), TiO2(101) does not show any significant change in charges (Table 3). Hence, the flow of charge is expected from BiVO4 to TiO2 as shown in Fig. 7b, especially under illumination conditions.

As shown in Fig. 7b and through various characterization results, the integration of BV and TiO2 at the heterojunctions minimizes the defects, such as oxygen vacancies, to a large extent. This in turn helps the charge separation to occur at the light absorption site. In essence, integrating BV in TiO2 pores results in the separation of light absorption and charge separation sites being close to the pore size, which is in the range of 1–5 nm.
Conclusions
The present study provides an appealing proof of concept for the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 + H2O to value added liquid fuels/chemicals in direct sunlight with an economically viable and scalable AL device. BVT-AL can be fabricated in any simple wet-chemistry laboratory. Efficient visible light absorbing BiVO4 QDs with a large number (sub-quadrillions) of BiVO4–TiO2 heterojunctions result in light absorption and charge separation sites within a few nm of each other. This enhances the charge separation and the subsequent diffusion holds the key to the impressive CO2 reduction rate reported in this manuscript. Furthermore, the electronic integration of BiVO4 and TiO2 minimizes the oxygen vacancies, especially at the heterojunctions, and further helps charge separation. The MeOH + HCHO yield reported in the current manuscript is in the theoretically predicted methanol yield range of 35–42% for a double junction light absorber. Although BVT is a single junction system, a wide wavelength range and effective light absorption due to BiVO4 QDs makes the present system more than a standard single junction system.8b Indeed, we believe that there is more scope to improve the BiVO4 content with a suitable synthetic strategy to increase the light absorption and subsequent CO2 conversion. The present manuscript also demonstrated the assembly of oxide quantum dots in another oxide matrix, which is an important aspect from a materials chemistry viewpoint. If carried out properly, such assembled/integrated materials could show potential for nitrogen activation to ammonia, and they are worth evaluating with carefully considered semiconductors. The current manuscript also indicates the possibility of making the photocatalyst by assembling and integrating the light absorbing QDs with an enormous increase in heterojunctions towards increasing the charge separation and utilization. More work is desired in this direction. Replacing the Pd-cathode with an earth abundant co-catalyst would make the device highly cost effective.
The optimum design of large area photoanodes with co-catalyst loading is expected to further enhance the charge utilization and hence also the activity. Larger devices may be prepared by methods such as screen printing, and evaluated for longer periods of time, which will ultimately meet future needs. Recycling of CO2-dissolved water with continuous replenishing of CO2 in a real-world continuous process with a thin liquid layer (≤0.2 mm) on a large area photoanode6 is expected to improve the activity further, as the contact time can be optimized with near 100% photons reaching the photoanode. This also provides an opportunity to fine tune the selectivity towards one of the two products. Hence, it is also worthwhile to study the reaction for the optimization of the reaction parameters, such as different flow rates of CO2, towards achieving higher activity.

 	Fig. 3  (a) UV-visible absorption spectra of photoanodes. The corresponding Tauc plot is shown in (b). The inset in (b) shows a digital photograph showing the color associated with the photoanodes. Note the bright yellow observed for BVT due to the quantum size and pore-confinement effect.	 

 	Fig. 4  TEM images of (a) TiO2 and (b) BVT photoanode (scale bar is 20 nm). (c) TEM, and (d and e) HRTEM of BVT demonstrate the BiVO4 confined in TiO2 mesopores and abundant heterojunctions among them. The area in the black square shown in panel (b) is shown in (c). The dark contrast and d-spacing confirm the presence of assembled BiVO4 in the TiO2. TiO2 interlayer spacing can (cannot) be clearly seen for empty (filled) pores of titania, and it characterizes the interaction among them. The uniform filling of small pores (∼2–3 nm diameter) with BiVO4 can be seen in (f). An HRTEM image of the bottom right corner of panel f is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†).

(b) Linear sweep voltammogram recorded under electrochemical CRR conditions shows a high current with the Pd-nanocubes, while the same in an N2 atmosphere shows a poor current. (c) Wavelength dependent IPCE performance of the BiVO4–TiO2, BiVO4 and TiO2 photoanodes are shown. An enhancement factor of 5–7 was observed with BVT compared to the parent BiVO4 over the visible light absorption regime, reiterating the role of the integrated 2.5 wt% BiVO4 QDs in titania in improving the current and hence the overall CRR activity. Integrated currents obtained from IPCE for the photoanodes are given in the inset.

Note that the scheme shown in panel (b) uses an arbitrary scale, mainly to show the quantum size effect of BVQDs on light absorption and charge separation/injection into TiO2.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) Schematic representation of the side-view of BVT-HJ formed by adsorbing BiVO4(121) over TiO2(101). At the heterojunction, the V and O ions of BiVO4(121) coordinate with the O and Ti ions of TiO2(101), respectively. The formation energy (Eform) of the BVT system is −1.35 eV, underlining its thermodynamic stability. (b) A close-up view of the BVT heterojunction showing the direction of charge transfer. From the Mulliken charges reported in Table 3 and Fig. S15,† it is observed that the TiO2(101) surface ions have more charge when the BVT heterojunction is formed. At the same time, a loss in the charge of the V ions is observed. Hence, a facile flow of charge is expected from BiVO4(121) to TiO2(101) across the junction. To aid the eye, the oxygens of BiVO4 and TiO2 are represented by dark red and red colors, respectively. Bi = violet, V = grey, Ti = blue.
