    , Accepted 24th October 2016First published on 24th October 2016AbstractDual redox mediators (RMs) were introduced for Mg–O2 batteries. 1,4-Benzoquinone (BQ) facilitates the discharge with an overpotential reduction of 0.3 V. 5,10,15,20-Tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine cobalt(II) (Co(II)TPP) facilitates the recharge with an overpotential decrease of up to 0.3 V. Importantly, the two redox mediators are compatible in the same DMSO-based electrolyte.
Recently alkaline metal–oxygen batteries such as Li–O2 and Na–O2 batteries have received significant attention, as they hold the promise to meet societal needs in terms of energy and power densities beyond what can be offered by state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries.1–4 From a volumetric energy density perspective, conversion chemistries based on multivalent metals (e.g., Mg and Al) should be more appealing for electrochemical energy storage than those based on alkaline metals.5,6 For instance, the theoretical volumetric capacity of Mg–O2 batteries can be up to 6264 W h L−1 based on the formation of MgO (or 4762 W h L−1 based on the formation of MgO2).7,8 It is much higher than that of Li–O2 batteries (3460 W h L−1).1 Furthermore, Mg is much more abundant on the crust of Earth and, hence, is much less expensive than Li.5 Mg does not face the challenges associated with dendritic growth upon plating and is therefore safer.5,6 For these reasons, Mg–O2 batteries have been proposed as candidates for post-Li-ion energy storage applications.8 However, to date, the advantages of Mg–O2 batteries remain untapped. Two critical issues are responsible for the slow progress. First, the round-trip efficiencies of the existing Mg–O2 batteries are unreasonably low (typically <50%) due to the low discharge and high recharge potentials. For example, Shiga et al. recently reported discharge plateaus at ca. 1.2 V (vs. Mg2+/Mg; unless noted, all voltages reported in this communication are relative to Mg2+/Mg),9,10 which is significantly lower than the 2.95 V expected from Mg → MgO conversion or 2.91 V from Mg → MgO2 conversion.8 It was later found that superoxide formation (which features an equilibrium potential of 2.04 V) may be responsible for the low discharge potential.8 Another factor that contributes to the low potentials is the passivation effect on the Mg anode, which increases the potential of the counter electrode and decreases the measurable cell voltage when tested in a two-electrode configuration.5,9,11 Second, the cyclability of the existing Mg–O2 batteries is too poor due to the difficulties in decomposing MgO and/or MgO2, which are produced by the strong interaction between Mg2+ and superoxide.8,12,13 Here we present a strategy that aims to tackle these two issues (low discharge and high recharge potentials) simultaneously. By introducing two redox mediators (RMs) at the same time, one for discharge and one for recharge, we show that the discharge potential can be increased and the recharge potential can be decreased when tested for at least 3 cycles using an unoptimized cell configuration.
Our strategy is schematically summarized in Fig. 1. For the discharge process, we seek to promote the conversion to oxide and peroxide while limiting the formation of superoxide. A redox mediator (RM) is introduced specifically for this purpose by taking advantage of the gap between the equilibrium potentials of superoxide formation (2.04 V) and oxide/peroxide formation (2.95 V/2.91 V). Under reducing conditions, the RM would be reduced first due to its higher redox potential and favorable kinetics; it then transfers the electron to dissolved O2 to form oxide (or peroxide), recovering itself to the oxidized form in the process. For recharge, we seek to reduce the overpotentials by including another RM with favorable kinetics for oxidation. Under oxidizing conditions, the RM would be oxidized first due to its lower redox potential; it then extracts electrons from the oxide (or peroxide) to yield O2 and recover itself to the reduced form. In principle, the reduced RM for discharge will not be oxidized by the RM for recharge as the RM for recharge is already in its reduced state; vice versa, the oxidized RM for recharge will not be reduced by the RM for discharge as the RM for discharge is already in its oxidized state. Although the RMs have been utilized to promote O2 reduction (discharge) or evolution (recharge) for Li–O2 batteries separately,14–21 it is important to note, however, that the introduction of two RMs to simultaneously address both discharge and recharge issues has not been reported for Mg–O2 batteries in the literature, to the best of our knowledge. We show here that such a strategy is powerful in solving problems in the unique system of Mg–O2 batteries.

In the search for the dual RMs, we first identified dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the solvent for this study as it has been previously reported to work well for the Mg–O2 system.9,13 We then researched the literature for redox pairs that are compatible with DMSO (Table S1 in the ESI†) and found 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) to be suitable as the discharge RM for this proof-of-concept demonstration. When tested in DMSO with supporting salt of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, 0.1 M) by cyclic voltammetry (CV), BQ exhibited two distinct redox peaks that correspond to the two consecutive single-electron transfer processes producing mono- and di-anions, respectively (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). The presence of strong Lewis acids such as Mg2+, nevertheless, altered the electrochemical behavior of BQ significantly.22–24 As shown in Fig. 2a (blue trace; measured in Ar), the two peaks corresponding to the two single-electron transfer steps merged into one broad peak in both the cathodic and the anodic scans when characterized in Mg(TFSI)2/DMSO electrolyte (Mg(TFSI)2 in DMSO, 0.1 M). Two features of the CV as shown in Fig. 2a are worth noting. First, the single pair of broad redox peaks are highly reproducible (the same feature was observed every time for a total of >10 different samples). Second, in the cathodic scan the reduction peak takes off (ca. 2.3 V) earlier than the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) potential (ca. 2.0 V), as shown in Fig. 2c (red trace, measured with O2). To prove that electron transfer from reduced BQ to O2 is fast and effective, we carried out CV scans of BQ in the presence of O2 and observed a nearly complete suppression of the anodic peak, which strongly supports that the reduced BQ is readily oxidized by O2. The reduced O2 then binds with Mg2+ to form MgO or MgO2. Note that here the formation of superoxide is unlikely, given the relatively low reduction potential needed for the reactions to take place. It is further noted that to exclude the possible influence by the passivation effect of the Mg anode, we performed all the electrochemical experiments in a three-electrode design (Fig. S2 in the ESI†), where a Mg pseudo reference electrode was present in the anode electrolyte. The utility of this configuration will be further discussed in this communication.

In choosing the RM to facilitate recharge, we turned our attention to organometallic compounds with macrocyclic ligands, as they have been shown to be catalytically active toward oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in non-aqueous solution.18,25,26 Within this context, since 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine cobalt(II) (Co(II)TPP) was previously found effective in promoting Li–O2 recharge,25 we hypothesize that it is a good candidate to serve as the recharge RM for Mg–O2 batteries. When tested in the Mg(TFSI)2/DMSO electrolyte, Co(II)TPP exhibited two groups of redox peaks at 2.8 V and 1.6 V, corresponding to the Co(II) ↔ Co(III) and Co(I) ↔ Co(II) conversion, respectively (Fig. 2b, blue trace; measured in Ar). Once O2 was introduced into the system, we see that the Co(I) ↔ Co(II) conversion was completely suppressed. This is because the potential (ca. 1.6 V) is lower than O2 reduction and, as such, the reduction of Co(II) to Co(I) is replaced by O2 reduction. Important to our purpose, the redox feature of Co(II) ↔ Co(III) was unperturbed by the presence of O2. Finally, it is of critical importance to note that the BQ redox pair and the Co(II)TPP redox pair were compatible with each other (Fig. 2d). Taken as a whole, this experiment sets the stage for us to test the idea as presented in Fig. 1.
As discussed previously, the electrochemical potential of the Mg anode tends to be altered by the passivation on the surface as a result of parasitic chemical reactions.5,9,11 Thus it is unreliable to measure the cathode potentials solely based on such an electrode. We therefore introduced a calibrated Mg pseudo reference electrode to mitigate this potential influence (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). Additionally, it has been previously shown that greater overpotentials were observed when TFSI− was used in the electrolyte for the stripping of Mg.27 To address this issue, we employed Mg(ClO4)2 as the supporting salt for the Mg anode electrolyte (Fig. S4 and S5 in the ESI†).9 However, Mg(ClO4)2 was not a good choice for the cathode reactions because of the poor reversibility of BQ in the presence of Mg(ClO4)2 (Fig. S6 in the ESI†). As such, we separated the anolyte (Mg(ClO4)2 in DMSO, 0.1 M) from the catholyte (Mg(TFSI)2 in DMSO, 0.1 M) using a glass-frit (fine grade; thickness: 2 mm; diameter: 1 cm). For future optimizations, this frit needs to be replaced by Mg2+-conductive membranes.28–31
Under limited capacity (0.06 mAh cm−2, corresponding to 10–20% of the total capacity of the carbon paper cathode) conditions, the effect of BQ in reducing the discharge overpotentials was obvious (Fig. 3a and Fig. S7 in the ESI†). The discharge plateau was increased from 1.9 V to 2.2 V, corresponding to an overpotential reduction of 0.3 V. The effect of Co(II)TPP on the recharge was not as pronounced for the first cycle, but more so for the subsequent cycles. For instance, the recharge plateau potential was decreased from 3.0 V to 2.7 V, corresponding to a 0.3 V reduction of the overpotentials. Note that the recharge plateau potentials for the first cycle are lower than 2.95 V expected from MgO → Mg2+ + 1/2O2 (or 2.91 V for MgO2 → Mg2+ + O2). This observation is consistent with other literature reports,8–10 although the underlying mechanisms for such deviation have not been fully understood to date. The solvation effect by the solvents may be an important reason.9 More research is needed to fully understand the phenomenon. To illustrate how the passivation effect on the Mg anode may influence the measurements, we also present in Fig. 3b the potentials between the working electrode (carbon paper) and the counter electrode (Mg ribbon) for the same set of experiments as shown in Fig. 3a. As can be seen, the round-trip efficiencies would be significantly underestimated when a two-electrode configuration was used. This is because the passivation on the Mg counter electrode would artificially increase its potential (Fig. S8 in the ESI†).9,11 The cycling profile was also plotted by capacity-cutoff for comparison (Fig. S9 in the ESI†).

Next, we studied the influence of the RMs on the discharge and recharge products using SEM (scanning electron microscopy), EDS (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy), X-ray diffraction (XRD), XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy. In Fig. 4, we compared the cathodes in discharged and charged states with and without the dual RMs. Comparing Fig. 4a and c, we see that while both solid products were observed, the presence of the RM (BQ for discharge) had an obvious influence on the product morphology. Large (ca. 10 μm) particles were observed in the absence of BQ,8 whereas small (with feature sizes <200 nm; see Fig. S10 in the ESI† for magnified views), more uniformly distributed particles were observed in the presence of BQ. We understand the difference as a result of the homogeneity of BQ in the solution. When serving as an RM, it would produce MgO (or MgO2) more uniformly in the solution, which then precipitated out onto the carbon paper to yield the well-dispersed, small particles as seen in Fig. 4c. This phenomenon serves as another strong piece of evidence to support that the formation of MgO (or MgO2) was mediated by BQ.

The elemental compositions of the solid products were further confirmed in Fig. S10 (ESI†) to be Mg and O by EDS. XRD patterns indicated that the discharge products in both cases were of low crystallinity (Fig. S11 in the ESI†). XPS spectra revealed that the solid discharge products contained no measureable F signal (Fig. 5c), supporting that the product was not due to the decomposition of Mg(TFSI)2 or its residues. Upon recharge, the Mg 1s signal was not detected by XPS (Fig. 5a), supporting that the removal of MgO (or MgO2) was complete. The residual O 1s signal (Fig. 5b) may be ascribed to the decomposition products of the solvent (Fig. S12 in ESI†) or the oxidation of the carbon cathode (Fig. S13 in the ESI†), which is common for metal–oxygen batteries.32 On the anode side, the Mg exhibited no dendritic growth (Fig. S14 in the ESI†).33,34 The unchanged peak of BQ in the 1H NMR spectra showed its good stability upon cycling, while the peaks corresponding to the paramagnetic Co(II)TPP species were undetectable due to the relatively small concentration in the electrolyte (Fig. S12 in the ESI†). In principle, the amount of MgO2 in the discharge products could be quantified by methods such as iodometric titration.35,36 The relatively small capacity in our experiments, however, made this task difficult. As far as the equilibrium potentials are concerned, the conversion Mg2+ + O2 → MgO or MgO2 are close (2.95 V vs. 2.91 V); our choice not to further identify the detailed composition of the product for the present work was justified. The pressure change during discharge and recharge (Fig. S15 in the ESI†) was also monitored in a semi-quantitative manner.37–41 During discharge, the cell with RMs consumed almost the same amount of gas (O2) compared with the cell without RMs, indicating the high efficiency of electron transfer from reduced BQ to oxygen. For the recharge process, the presence of Co(II)TPP contributed to the same pressure increase (due to O2 evolution as a result of MgO or MgO2 decomposition), supporting that Co(II)TPP efficiently facilitates the decomposition of Mg oxides.

In conclusion, we introduced a new scheme that involves two RMs to facilitate the discharge and recharge processes of Mg–O2 battery operations within the same non-aqueous electrolyte. BQ was shown to increase the discharge voltage by ca. 0.3 V, while Co(II)TPP was shown to decrease the recharge voltage by up to 0.3 V. The effect of Co(II)TPP was particularly obvious after the first cycle. The proof-of-concept demonstration will serve as an important first step toward actualizing the full potentials of Mg–O2 batteries.
