    , Accepted 7th June 2013First published on 7th June 2013Abstract1,5-Bis(3-methylimidazole-2-selone)pentane (Pbis), which belongs to the coordination chemistry of organochalcogenone compounds, was used as a novel Se precursor to purposely synthesize various metal selenide nanostructures. By this method, CdSe, Bi2Se3, ZnSe and PbSe have been successfully prepared and all exhibit relatively uniform size and morphology. High water solubility and good dispersity is achieved by using poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) as the capping agent. At the same time, the shape of the metal selenide nanostructures could be controlled by adjusting the experimental conditions. The thermoelectric properties of the Bi2Se3 have also been discussed. It would be expected that Pbis could be more widely used to prepare more metal selenide nanostructures with uniform morphologies, sizes, and remarkable properties.
Introduction
Recently, metal selenide nanomaterials have attracted increasing attention due to their promising optical, magnetic and electrical properties leading to developments in biological labeling, diagnostics, photovoltaic solar cells, light-emitting diodes and thermoelectric devices.1 The remarkable properties and attractive potential applications of metal selenide nanomaterials are inextricably related to their size, shape, and composition.2 Consequently, it is meaningful to develop green, facile and general synthetic methods that yield metal selenide nanomaterials with high-quality, high-dispersity and desirable chemical composition for both basic research and practical applications.
Over the past decade, a large number of classic methods have been developed for the preparation of metal selenide nanomaterials.3–22 In 2001, Peng and co-workers12 used CdO or Cd(Ac)2, which were inexpensive and stable in air as precursors instead of dimethylcadmium to synthesize high-quality CdSe colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals by a simple and reproducible route. In 2005, Murray's group13 used lead acetate and trioctylphosphine selenide (TOPSe) as precursors to synthesize solution-phase single-crystalline PbSe nanowires through oriented attachment of nanocrystal building blocks, in which PbSe nanocrystals can bind to each other on either {100}, {110}, or {111} crystal face, depending on the surfactant molecules presented in the reaction solution. Korgel et al.14 used selenourea as Se precursor to synthesize solution-stable chalcopyrite CuInSe2 nanocrystals which exhibit an interesting trigonal pyramidal shape. Furthermore, Vittal and co-workers15 synthesized monodispersed one-dimensional (1D) AgInSe2, which is isostructural with the AgInS2 (JCPDS-00-025-1328), by thermal decomposition of metal selenocarboxylate complexes which are used as a single-source precursor. Recently, Jeong and co-workers16 used Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and Na2SeO3 as precursors to obtain ultrathin (4–6 nm) single-crystal Bi2Se3 nanodiscs and nanosheets. Pang's group17 reported a process of selenite reduction from SeO32− to glutathione–selenopersulfide (GSSeH). GSSeH, as a fresh Se precursor, reacted with Ag+ to form Ag2Se quantum dots, which may have potential applications in NIR bioimaging. In addition, dual functional EuSe nanocrystals, single-crystalline SnSe nanowires and cuboctahedral p-type Cu2Se nanocrystals were all obtained.18 From these classic synthesis methods we can find that Se powder, TOP-Se, Na2SeO3 and single-source including metal and selenium for thermal decomposition have been regarded as the most common selenium sources. Nevertheless, these traditional Se precursors have several disadvantages. For example, TOP-Se13,19 are expensive, toxic and unstable in the open-air systems; Na2SeO3 can react with metal ions (Mn+) to form precipitates in some systems, as a result of which (Mn+) ions should be additionally transformed into stable complexes in order to obtain uniform reaction conditions.21 Thermal decomposition of single-source15,22 also has a number of shortcomings, such as the complexity of synthesis single-source and the limitation to obtain various metal selenide nanomaterials. In view of these disadvantages of traditional precursors of selenium, it is urgent to develop air-stable, efficient and generally applicable Se precursors for the preparation of metal selenide nanomaterials.
After trying a series of Se precursors, we recently found that 1,5-bis(3-methylimidazole-2-selone)pentane (Pbis, Scheme 1)23 could be used as a novel Se precursor to synthesize metal selenide nanomaterials. By comparison with the traditional precursors of selenium, its advantages are as follows: (a) since Pbis is obtained by the reaction of Se powder and 1,5-bis(3-methylimidazole)pentane, and 1,5-bis(3-methylimidazole)pentane is significantly positively charged, the valence state of Se in the Pbis should be negative. As a result, Pbis may directly, rapidly and efficiently react with metal cations, and a shorter reaction time should be required; (b) Pbis is stable in the air compared with TOP-Se or selenourea so that it can be easily stored and its synthesis process is simple as well.

Herein, using this novel Pbis as Se precursor, we demonstrate a general, facile method that can prepare various metal selenide nanomaterials. We have successfully obtained three-dimensional (3D) hollow CdSe nanospheres, two-dimensional (2D) Bi2Se3 nanodiscs, one-dimensional (1D) ZnSe nanowires and PbSe star-shaped nanostructures, which all exhibit good dispersity and water-solubility. Their morphology can be tuned by changing the reaction conditions. We find that PVP molecular weight or the introduction of some other agents all play a key role in determining the shape of these as-synthesized metal selenide nanostructures. At the same time, the thermoelectric properties (Bi2Se3 nanodiscs) are investigated. We hope that this new method can pave the way for the synthesis of metal selenide nanomaterials, and more superior properties can be found in these metal chalcogenides.
Experimental
Materials
1.5-Diiodopentane (97%), 1-methylimidazole (99%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Selenium powder (Se, 99.99%), poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw = 55000, 40000, 10000), and hydrazine hydrate (50–60%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Cadmium(II) acetate dihydrate (98.5%), lead(II) acetate trihydrate (99.0%), bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate (99%), zinc(II) acetate dehydrate (99%), ethylenediamine (99%), potassium carbonate (99%), diethylene glycol (DEG, 99%), and ethylene glycol (EG, 99%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Methanol, ethanol, acetone and ethyl acetate (Beijing Chemical Reagents Company) were analytical grade reagents. All chemicals were used as received without further treatment.
Synthesis of Pbis
The Pbis was prepared according to literature procedures.23 A mixture of 1.5-bis(3-methyl-imidazolium)pentane diiodide (obtained quantitatively by refluxing 1-methylimidazole in 1,5-diiodopentane for 2 h, followed by filtration and washing of the solid with diethyl ether) (9.70 g, 0.02 mol), K2CO3 (4.5 g, 0.03 mol), elemental Se (3.2 g, 0.04 mol) and ethanol (300 ml) was stirred under reflux for 24 h and filtered hot through a pad of Celite. The solution was evaporated to dryness and the compound was obtained as an orange powder by crystallization from CH2Cl2/ethanol.
Synthesis of hollow CdSe nanospheres
A Pbis/DEG stock solution was first prepared by dissolving Pbis (1 mmol) in DEG (10 mL). This solution was heated at 70 °C under nitrogen as inert gas atmosphere for an hour, and kept at room temperature. In a typical synthesis, cadmium(II) acetate (0.1 mmol), PVP (Mw = 55000, 2 mmol), and DEG (10 mL) were mixed together, and the mixture was heated to 210 °C under a protective nitrogen atmosphere. Pbis/DEG (1 mL) stock solution was injected rapidly into the hot mixture. The reaction solution turned dark red within 1 min and then was further heated 10 min at 210 °C. The products were cooled to room temperature to yield hollow CdSe nanospheres with a size of about 500–600 nm. The final product was collected by filtration, washed with anhydrous ethanol and acetone three times to remove any possible ionic remnants, and dispersed in 2 ml ethanol.
Synthesis of Bi2Se3 nanodiscs
The preparation of Bi2Se3 nanodiscs was similar to Jeong et al.16 except that hydrazine hydrate was used instead of hydroxylamine. In a typical synthesis, bismuth(III) nitrate (0.1 mmol), PVP (Mw = 55000, 0.9 mmol), Pbis (0.15 mmol, 58.5 mg), and EG (12 mL) were mixed together and heated to 180 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Hydrazine hydrate solution (0.12 mL in 0.88 mL EG) was injected rapidly into the hot mixture. The reaction mixture turned dark purple immediately and then was heated for 10 min at 180 °C. The final product was collected by filtration, washed with anhydrous ethanol and acetone to remove any possible ionic remnants three times, and dispersed in 2 mL ethanol.
Synthesis of ZnSe nanowires
In a typical synthesis, zinc(II) acetate (0.1 mmol), Pbis (0.1 mmol, 39 mg), PVP (Mw = 40000, 2 mmol, 222 mg), ethylenediamine (1 mL) and DEG (10 mL) were mixed together and gradually warmed up to 220 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h. During this process, the solution gradually turned yellowish. The final product was collected by filtration, washed with anhydrous ethanol and acetone to remove any possible ionic remnants three times, and dispersed in 2 mL ethanol.
Synthesis of PbSe star-shaped nanostructures
In a typical synthesis, Lead(II) acetate (0.1 mmol), PVP (Mw = 10000, 0.6 mmol, 667 mg) and DEG (10 mL) were mixed together and heated to 60 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Pbis/DEG (1 mL) stock solution was injected rapidly into the mixture. Thereafter, the solution was quickly heated to 220 °C, and kept at this temperature for 10 min. The final product was collected by filtration, washed with anhydrous ethanol and acetone to remove any possible ionic remnants three times, and dispersed in 2 mL ethanol.
Material characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a Rigaku D/Max-2500 diffractometer with a graphite monochromator by using Cu Kα radiation operating at 200 mA and 40 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed on a FEI tecnai G2 S-Twin with a field emission gun operating at 200 kV. Images were acquired digitally on a Gantan multiple CCD camera. The FEI tecnai G2 S-Twin is equipped with an EDS detector, which was used for elemental analysis of the nanocrystal composition. The absorption spectra of the CdSe hollow nanospheres were obtained with an UV-2450 UV-visible spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out using an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with a Mg Kα X-ray excitation source. Thermal conductivity is characterized based on the Netzsch LFA427 laser technique. Electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficients are measured by a ZEM-3 apparatus (ULVAC-RIKO, Inc.).
Results and discussion
In order to demonstrate the unique feature of this novel Se precursor, we chose CdSe, ZnSe, Bi2Se3 and PbSe which belong to the classic metal selenide of II–VI, V–VI and IV–VI respectively to synthesize. All the metal selenide nanostructures in this paper were synthesized using the modified polyol method. The polyol process was initially focused on the preparation of monodispersed metals and alloys more than 20 years ago. Later it has been extensively used for the synthesis of nanoscale oxide, sulfide, phosphate and rare earth materials.24 The polyol, such as EG and DEG, is a good solvent, and can easily dissolve a variety of polar inorganic materials owing to its high permittivity and boiling point.25 In addition, we also chose PVP as surfactant, which shows strong coordination power with (Mn+) to prevent metal selenide nanostructures from agglomeration and can also render the particles with water dispersibility. Structural information, morphology and other characterizations of the metal selenide sample will be described separately below.
Hollow CdSe nanospheres
Herein, we used Pbis as Se precursor and one-step synthesized hollow CdSe nanospheres. The crystal structure of the as-synthesized hollow CdSe nanospheres was investigated by XRD. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of hollow CdSe nanospheres, which is in good accordance with the bulk wurtzite CdSe crystal phase (JCPDS no. 65-3436) and no peaks of other impurities can be found. Moreover, the relatively broadened diffraction peaks indicate that the CdSe crystals constituting hollow spheres are of small size. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis further confirms the local element composition of the hollow CdSe nanospheres (Fig. S1a, ESI†). In addition, the thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) curve (Fig. S2a, ESI†) shows the as-synthesized hollow CdSe nanospheres are stable up to 900 K.

An overview SEM image at low magnification, as shown in Fig. 2a, indicates that the sample consists entirely of a relatively uniform spherical shape with an average diameter of about 550 nm. As shown by the arrows in the SEM image, a few imperfect or hemispherical hollow spheres are found, demonstrating the hollow structure of the nanospheres. The full view of hollow CdSe nanospheres is also given by a TEM image (Fig. 2b), in which the hollow inner and thicker outer shell can be clearly seen. We can see that the diameter of the hollow CdSe nanospheres is in good accordance with the results observed in the SEM image, and the electron diffraction (ED) patterns are also consistent with the XRD patterns. The high-magnification TEM and SEM of a representative hollow sphere (Fig. 2c and d) both exhibit its rough surface that indicates the shells of hollow spheres are composed of small primary particles. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image which is taken at the shell of one hollow sphere further reveals that the primary CdSe nanocrystals and the hollow shells are well-crystallized single crystals (as shown in Fig. 2e). The distances between adjacent atomic lattice fringes are about 0.376 nm and 0.350 nm, which correspond to the (100) and (002) lattice plane of wurtzite CdSe. Meanwhile, XPS is performed (Fig. S3, ESI†). The peak of Cd 3d5/2 and Se 3d is 405.2 eV and 54.2 eV, respectively, and the difference between the two peak positions of Se 3d and Cd 3d5/2 is 351.0 eV, which is in accordance with the reported results for bulk CdSe and nanocrystals.26

According to the report of Yang's group27 on ZnSe spherical flowerlike nanoarchitectures, we speculate that PVP plays a similar role in the formation and assembly of CdSe nanoparticles into hollow nanospheres. It could prevent the growth of the nanocrystallites and agglomeration of the hollow nanospheres. Furthermore, we find the molecular weight of PVP also has a dramatic effect. When using PVP (Mw = 10000) as surfactant, the quantity of hollow CdSe nanospheres was greatly reduced, while a large number of minor CdSe nanoclusters appeared, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. When using PVP (Mw = 40000) as surfactant, the size and shape of the sample (Fig. 3c and d) were similar to those using PVP (Mw = 55000). Regarding this phenomenon, we think that higher molecular weight PVP can prevent the growth of CdSe nanocrystallites more efficiently. This allows the CdSe nanocrystallites to have a higher surface energy, as a result the self-assembly effect of CdSe nanocrystallites is greatly strengthened. Therefore, we consider that higher molecular weight PVP can play a stabilizing effect on the initial formation of nanospheres and the subsequent ripening process. In addition, it is notable that the above process can be completed within a shorter time than previous reports,28 thus proving that Pbis can rapidly react with Cd precursor salt, and has a high reaction activity.

UV-vis absorption spectrum characterization of as-synthesized hollow CdSe nanospheres is performed, and the result is shown in Fig. 4. The absorption spectrum was recorded by dispersing the powder sample in anhydrous ethanol ultrasonic (5 min) treatment. It can be seen that the bandgap of the hollow CdSe nanospheres is calculated to be 2.06 eV by the direct conversion method. This is larger than the reported value for bulk CdSe (Eg = 1.7 eV)29 which may be attributed to the small size of the well-ordered arrays of the hollow CdSe nanosphere walls, indicating the quantum size effect of this sample. It is expected that the unique property of the hollow CdSe nanospheres may offer exciting opportunities for potential applications in orange emitters, catalysts, absorption, and gas sensors. In addition, such characterizations as EDX, TGA and UV-vis analyses of all the other as-synthesized metal selenides have been exhibited in Fig. S1b–d, S2b–d and S4a–c, ESI.†

Bi2Se3 nanodiscs
Bismuth selenide has attracted broad attention not only because of its well-known pronounced layered crystal structure and good thermoelectric properties with a small direct band gap (Eg = 0.3 eV)30 but also because of its capacity as a 3D topological insulator (TI) with a single Dirac cone on the surface which has potential applications in magnetoelectricity, spintronics and quantum computing.31 Here, we used Pbis as Se precursor to synthesize Bi2Se3 nanodiscs, which are shown in Fig. 5a. The nanodiscs have a relatively uniform shape and an average lateral diameter of 160 nm. The ED patterns confirm that the nanodisc has crystallinity. Fig. 5b shows the XRD pattern of the products and the standard data for Bi2Se3 as well. All of the diffraction peaks are in good accordance with the bulk rhombohedral Bi2Se3 crystal phase (JCPDS no. 33-0214). No characteristic peaks of other impurities are detected, showing the high purity of the sample. Fig. 5c shows a bilayered Bi2Se3 nanodisc, which has well-defined hexagonal nanodiscs with a truncated triangular second layer. Fig. 5d shows the HRTEM image of the hexagonal nanodisc layer, designated by a circular dotted line in Fig. 5c. The distance between the adjacent atomic lattice fringe is about 0.209 nm, which corresponds with the (110) lattice plane of hexagonal Bi2Se3. Meanwhile, detailed XPS spectra of Bi 4f presented in Fig. S5a, ESI,† shows that peaks appear at 158.2 eV (Bi 4f7/2) and 163.5 eV (Bi 4f5/2) with a splitting of 5.3 eV, which is in good agreement with previous reports.32 The peaks at 53.7 eV (Fig. S5b, ESI†) can be assigned to the bonding energy of the Se 3d transition. The growth mechanism of Bi2Se3 nanodiscs, we considered, is the same as the previous report by Jeong16 in which crystal seeds grew via 2D self-attachment of small nanoparticles followed by epitaxial recrystallization into single crystals.

The efficiency of thermoelectric (TE) materials can be determined by dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT (ZT = σS2T/κ), where S is Seebeck coefficient (thermoelectric power) of the TE materials, σ and κ are the electrical and thermal conductivities respectively, and T is the average temperature of the sample. Among all TE materials, Bi2Te3-based materials have distinguished thermal power at low-temperature.33 However, the application of such materials can only be performed under 500 K because of decomposition. For our as-synthesized Bi2Se3 nanodiscs, we note that it was stable under 850 K (Fig. S2b, ESI†). At the same time, the ZT value is increased between 300 K and 600 K as well (Fig. 6). The electrical conductivity (Fig. 6a) of Bi2Se3 nanodiscs at 300 K is 38678 S m−1 and slightly down to 38176 S m−1 around 400 K, and then goes up to 39506 S m−1 at 600 K. Fig. 6b shows the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient in Bi2Se3 nanodiscs. The negative Seebeck coefficient value indicates an n-type conduction. The Seebeck coefficient measurement shows an increasing trend from −52.5 μV K−1 at 300 K to −68.4 μV K−1 at 600 K. The thermal conductivity (Fig. 6c) is measured to be 0.785 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K and 0.850 W m−1 K−1 at 600 K. The calculated power factor (σS2) and ZT (Fig. 6d) value for Bi2Se3 nanodiscs continued to increase from 107 μW m−1 K−2 and 0.041 at 300 K to 185 μW m−1 K−2 and 0.131 at 600 K. When comparing these results to previous reports,34 we observe an enhancement of the ZT value of the as-synthesized Bi2Se3. We believe that when the dimensions of a material are reduced to the nanometer scale, the decrease of the thermal conductivity plays a more significant role in the enhancement of ZT than the increase of power factor.35

ZnSe nanowires
In a similar way, ZnSe (bandgap energy of ∼2.67 eV at room temperature), as an important II–VI semiconductor,36 has also been synthesized. The as-synthesized ZnSe exhibits a nanoscale wire-shaped structure. Fig. 7a shows the XRD patterns of ZnSe nanowires. The results of the XRD indicate that the product crystallized well and the patterns are in good accordance with the bulk zinc-blende ZnSe crystal phase (JCPDS no. 37-1463). The three major peaks can be indexed as (111), (220) and (311), respectively. No peaks of any impurity are found. The morphology and nanostructure of the obtained ZnSe nanowires are investigated by TEM (Fig. 7b). It can be seen that the average diameter of an individual nanowire is about 30 nm, with a length up to several micrometers. The ED patterns of ZnSe nanowires are consistent with the XRD as well. The high-magnification TEM image (inset of Fig. 7b) indicates that the possible growth mechanism of the ZnSe nanowire is due to the oriented attachment of small units of ZnSe. According to previous reports,37,38 we consider that the complexing reagent ethylenediamine, which contains two N-chelating atoms in each molecule, may partly act as a molecular bridge to combine with Zn2+ and Se2− in a line. In order to demonstrate its template effect, the same experiment is repeated except for the absence of ethylenediamine. Fig. 7c presents the XRD patterns of the products, and all of the diffraction peaks can be indexed as the bulk hexagonal wurzite ZnSe crystal phase (JCPDS no. 15-0105). At the same time, highly aggregated nanocrystals without well-defined morphologies were also formed (as shown in Fig. 7d). The result indicates that ethylenediamine is not only necessary for the formation of the ZnSe nanowires, but can tune the crystal structure of ZnSe. Furthermore, the synthesis process of ZnSe nanowires needs enough time for the anisotropic growth of the precursor,38 so that the reaction process is much slower than any other as-synthesized metal selenides, although Pbis has a very high reaction efficiency with metal precursors.

PbSe star-shaped nanostructures
Subsequently, when the metal precursor salt was changed to lead(II) acetate trihydrate, PbSe star-shaped nanostructures were prepared as well. Fig. 8a shows the XRD patterns of PbSe star-shaped nanostructures in the presence of PVP (Mw = 10000). The results of the XRD indicate that the products crystallized well and are in good accordance with the bulk PbSe crystal phase (JCPDS no. 78-1902). No peaks of any impurity were detected. An overview morphology and nanostructure of the obtained PbSe star-shaped nanostructures is investigated by TEM (Fig. 8b) and the size ranges from 350 nm to 500 nm. The ED patterns also indicate that the nanostructures have crystallinity. We believe that the formation process of PbSe star-shaped nanostructures is similar to the one proposed for flower-like PbTe by Li.39 In the presence of PVP, {100} faces will grow preferentially when the reaction was carried out for some time. The star shape can be described as truncated octahedron where six symmetric {100} faces have grown into horns. In addition, Fig. 8c and d shows the TEM images of the as-synthesized PbSe star-shaped nanostructures in the presence of PVP (Mw = 40000 and 55000, respectively). The shape changes from star-like to octahedral, meaning that the growth rate of the {100} face is decreased when the molecular weight of PVP is increased. Hence, the shape of the PbSe can be easily tuned by varying the weight of PVP.

Conclusions
In summary, we have used Pbis as a novel Se precursor to successfully synthesize various metal selenides, including hollow CdSe nanospheres, Bi2Se3 nanodiscs, ZnSe nanowires and PbSe star-shaped nanostructures. The significance of the present study is triple-fold. Firstly, this study suggests that Pbis is not only hydrophilic, air-stable and easily obtained, but can also directly, rapidly and efficiently react with simple metal precursor salt. Secondly, each of the as-synthesized metal selenide nanostructures exhibits high water solubility and good dispersity as well as relative uniform size and shape in their respective most optimized synthetic conditions. Thirdly and most importantly, this method provides a general, facile and efficient route to the synthesis of various metal selenide nanostructures. The as-synthesized metal selenide nanostructures exhibit unique properties and promise wide potential applications in photovoltaic devices, light-emitting diodes and thermoelectric cooling. We believe this novel Se precursor can be extended to the synthesis of other metal selenide nanomaterials with uniform morphologies, sizes, and remarkable properties.
