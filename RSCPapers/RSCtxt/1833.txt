    , Accepted 13th April 2021First published on 14th April 2021AbstractHigh quality factor and small mode volume in nanocavities enable the demonstration of efficient nanophotonic devices with low power consumption, strong nonlinearity, and high modulation speed, due to the strong light–matter interaction. In this review, we focus on recent state-of-the-art nanocavities and their applications. We introduce single nanocavities including semiconductor nanowires, plasmonic cavities, and nanostructures based on quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC), for laser, photovoltaic, and nonlinear applications. In addition, nanocavity arrays with unique feedback mechanisms, including BIC cavities, parity-time symmetry coupled cavities, and photonic topological cavities, are introduced for laser applications. These various cavity designs and underlying physics in single and array nanocavities are useful for the practical implementation of promising nanophotonic devices.
1. Introduction
Nanocavities enable strong light confinement at wavelength or subwavelength scales. Resonant modes in nanocavities form effective channels through which light can interact with materials. Increased photon lifetime and enhanced photon intensity have been exploited for various nanophotonic applications, such as nanolasers, nonlinear devices, and photovoltaic devices, which outperform traditional bulk optical devices.1,2 The unique features of nanocavities can also open up new research fields, such as topological photonics and non-Hermitian photonics.3–5
Two essential parameters in nanocavities, the quality (Q) factor and mode volume of resonant modes, are used to present the interaction between light and matter.6 The Q factor is defined as the ratio of the energy stored in the cavity to the energy lost per cycle of oscillation. The mode volume is defined as the volume integral of the electric field energy in the cavity divided by the maximum field energy.7 The Q factor and mode volume are indicators of the temporal and spatial control of photons, respectively. Especially, in a nanocavity with high Q factor and small mode volume, the radiative lifetime of the integrated gain material is shortened by the Purcell effect.8 The enhanced spontaneous emission and an increase in the nonlinear efficiency in such nanocavities have attracted considerable attention for their practical applications.
A variety of nanomaterials and nanostructures have been investigated using advanced semiconductor synthesis and fabrication techniques. Notably, one-dimensional (1D) single nanowires grown using a vapor–liquid–solid mechanism were demonstrated as compact semiconductor lasers.9,10 Photonic crystals and microdisks were also employed to confine light in a mode volume with a cubic half-wavelength.7,11,12 Also, the strong demand for photonic devices with sizes comparable to those of fast-downscaling electronics has led to the development of subwavelength plasmonic devices.13–15 Surface plasmon polaritons oscillate at metal–dielectric interfaces and enable light confinement in the region below the diffraction limit. Subwavelength plasmonic lasers were demonstrated using rationally designed metallic cavities, overcoming the limitation of the low Q factors originated from the intrinsic ohmic loss of the metal.16
Efforts have also been made to enhance the temporal interaction of photons with matter in metal-free dielectric resonators by increasing the Q factor, while maintaining the physical size of the resonator at the wavelength scale. Recently, a different approach, bound states in the continuum (BICs), was proposed for increasing the Q factor in a periodic dielectric array.17,18 The destructive interference of leaky modes suppresses radiation loss. High-Q BIC lasers can achieve high-brightness coherent feedback over a broad emission area, showing a single mode and low lasing threshold. Even in an individual high-refractive-index dielectric nanostructure, the BIC state appears, where it is termed a “quasi-BIC”.19 A significant increase in the Q factor and nonlinear conversion efficiency has been observed in the quasi-BIC regime.
Furthermore, a non-Hermitian system with asymmetric gain and loss can be realized using coupled nanocavities.4 By introducing a graphene layer on only one nanocavity, asymmetric optical gain and loss were achieved, and sufficient gain contrast was obtained, resulting in frequency splitting and an exceptional point (EP).20 More recently, photonic topological insulators (PTIs) have emerged, in which the resonant mode is protected from defects or disorders in the cavities.21,22 A higher-order topological corner state as well as an edge state was used to demonstrate low-threshold lasing, which is robust to structural defects.23
Herein, we review these recent state-of-the-art nanocavities and their applications. We first discuss single nanocavities, including wavelength-scale nanowires, subwavelength-scale plasmonic cavities, and quasi-BIC nanostructures, based on inorganic semiconductor materials, for laser, photovoltaic, and nonlinear applications (Section 2). Next, nanocavity arrays, including high-Q BIC cavities, coupled cavities with asymmetric gain/loss, and photonic topological cavities, are introduced, and their applications are discussed (Section 3). We conclude this review by discussing future perspectives in Section 4.
2. Single nanocavities and their applications
2.1 Inorganic semiconductor nanowires
Semiconductor nanowires with different morphologies and tunable electro-optical properties have been synthesized in a controlled manner. Over the past few decades, strategies for synthesizing nanowire structures have been explored using the well-established metal nanocluster-catalyzed vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) growth process (Fig. 1a).24,25 In this process, a vapor phase source for the semiconductor nanowire dissolved in liquid metal droplets is maintained at a temperature near or above the melting point of the metal. The continuously dissolved gas from the source supersaturates the droplet, and the chemical potential at the liquid–solid interfaces acts as a driving force for nucleation of the solid semiconductor. The physical properties of nanowires grown by the VLS process are controlled by the size and physical properties of the liquid alloy. The unique morphologies of nanowires, such as rectangular, hexagonal, and octagonal facets, can be tailored during the synthesis by modifying the growth temperature of the shell and partial pressure of silane.26,27 In addition, nanowire doping, which is crucial for forming an active device, can also be tuned by varying the growth conditions.

Several motivations have fueled intensive research into nanowires. Nanowire photovoltaic devices, which are distinct from their bulk counterparts, can efficiently absorb light due to the specific resonant modes with the desired modal shape and wavelength.28,29 The unique optical properties of nanowires, subwavelength dimensions, and high refractive index contrast cause strong light confinement in the nanowires. Notably, the absorption and scattering cross-sections of nanowire structures are larger than their physical dimensions, which is the driving force for photovoltaic device applications.30–33 Furthermore, the interaction between incident light and nanowires can be easily manipulated by subtle structural changes via the optical antenna effect, resulting in extended absorption and scattering cross-sections at the desired wavelengths.
The p–i–n core–shell Si nanowire was introduced with several unique designs and implementation schemes to improve the power conversion efficiency of nanowire photovoltaic devices. For example, a simple and low-cost process was investigated for dramatic enhancement of the optical antenna effect by coating the p–i–n core–shell nanowire with a conformal dielectric shell (Fig. 1b).32 The p–i–n core–shell Si nanowires were synthesized by the VLS and vapor–solid (VS) mechanism in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor. The as-grown nanowires were coated with dielectric shells using the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process.34 Then, single-nanowire photovoltaic devices were fabricated by depositing anode and cathode electrodes defined on the p-type core and n-type shell regions, respectively. The light absorption was enhanced by 50–200% and the light scattering improved by 200–1000% due to the optical antenna effect of the dielectric shell. The short-circuit current density (JSC) in nanowire photovoltaics with a dielectric shell optical antenna was enhanced by ∼80% under 1 sun illumination due to the increased light–matter interaction.
Our group introduced a 1D dielectric grating structure in a Si nanowire photovoltaic device to further enhance light absorption (Fig. 1c, top).33 A single nanowire device incorporating a 1D dielectric grating structure was fabricated by a damage-free, precisely aligned, polymer-assisted transfer method.35 The photocurrent was efficiently enhanced for transverse-electric (TE) polarized light (Fig. 1c, bottom). The structured peaks for TE-polarized light appeared in several wavelength regions, where the absorption enhancement was tuned by adjusting the grating pitch, while the electrical properties and performance of the devices were preserved during the transfer process. Additionally, Si nanowires combined with a 1D dielectric grating structure afforded 19.5% enhancement of light absorption compared to the same devices without the grating. There was also no degradation in the electrical properties. Such attempts to enhance light absorption should enable the emergence of nanowire photovoltaics in next-generation high-efficiency and low-cost solar cells.
Furthermore, active semiconductor nanowires with a direct bandgap can be used as promising light sources as they exhibit strong photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL). For example, GaN and InGaN nanowires have practical advantages as efficient light sources in the visible spectral regime.10,36 The naturally formed 1D Fabry–Pérot cavity derived from the clear end facets and the large refractive index contrast in the nanowire enable strong light confinement and resultant lasing action with a low threshold. Nanowire lasers offer unique opportunities for nanophotonic and optoelectronic applications. The well-established technique of doping nanowires makes it possible to induce electrical operation of nanowire lasers.37 In addition, because a single nanowire with a diameter smaller than the wavelength of the incident light can radially confine optical modes and guide light, the integration of the nanowires with other photonic structures would be straightforward via their evanescent coupling.38–40
2.2 Plasmonic cavities
Many dielectric nano-optical cavities, such as photonic crystals and microdisks, exhibit high Q/V;41–46 however, the miniaturization of these nanocavities is limited by the diffraction limit. In contrast with dielectric nanocavities, plasmonic cavities can be further miniaturized, reaching a subwavelength mode volume.15,47–51 The Q factors of plasmonic cavities are limited by the inherent metallic absorption loss; however, the strong mode confinement in the plasmonic cavities can be exploited to effectively increase light–matter interactions.
Sudden changes in metal surfaces, such as metal gratings, cause strong scattering loss of surface plasmons due to strong field confinement near the metal surface. Thus, careful design of metallic cavities is necessary to achieve a significant reduction in the mode volume and simultaneously minimize radiation loss.
Our group proposed a plasmonic mode-gap mechanism to confine surface plasmons in a deep-subwavelength cavity, while radiation loss was well suppressed. In 2009, Seo et al. demonstrated a full three-dimensional subwavelength plasmonic cavity based on a metal-coated dielectric nanowire with an axial heterostructure (Fig. 2a, left).52 The plasmonic cavity was constructed by introducing an axial heterostructure along the nanowire axis in a two-dimensional (2D) plasmonic waveguide of a metal-coated dielectric nanowire. Surface plasmons were confined in the desired region by the effective plasmonic mirrors, and the surface plasmons excited at the higher-index nanowire–metal interface were strongly confined axially by an effective plasmonic mode-gap mirror that consisted of a lower-index nanowire core and metal shell (Fig. 2a, right). The refractive indices of the high-index nanowire core and low-index shell were set to 2.6 (for example, CdS or InGaN in the visible wavelength) and 1.5 (SiO2), respectively, and Ag was used as the metal shell. The total diameter of the dielectric region, high-index core, and low-index shell was fixed at 50 nm. The plasmonic waveguide mode has a cut-off frequency that can be controlled by introducing a low-index shell. The existence of this cut-off frequency is a unique characteristic of this plasmonic cavity, which distinguishes it from the conventional metal–insulator–metal (MIM) structure with no cut-off frequency. Our numerical simulations showed that a Q factor of >36000 was achieved at 20 K for a cavity with dimensions of <50 × 50 × 40 nm3 (mode volume, V ∼ 10−5 μm3). This ultrasmall plasmonic cavity can be used as a plasmonic LED or laser device coupled to a plasmonic waveguide with a high coupling efficiency in deep-subwavelength photonic systems.

In 2011, our group also proposed an ultrasmall plasmonic cavity consisting of a high-index/low-index dielectric nanorod covered with silver (Fig. 2b).53 The surface plasmons were confined strongly only at the interface between the high refractive index dielectric and silver owing to the large frequency gap between the plasmonic modes excited at the high-index dielectric–silver interface and the low-index dielectric–silver interface. Furthermore, an extremely small mode volume was achieved because the top of the nanorod was covered with silver. The Q/V ratio can be increased significantly by rational design of the plasmonic cavity. Indeed, the mode volumes decreased much faster than the Q factors as the physical dimensions of the cavity became smaller. A large Purcell factor (>2 × 105) was obtained for the cavity with dimensions of 60 × 5 × 200 nm3 at 40 K. Enhanced spontaneous emission due to such a large Purcell factor can result in high-performance nanophotonic devices, particularly for high-efficiency single-photon sources.
An optically pumped full-three-dimensional (3D) plasmonic laser was first demonstrated in an experiment by our group in 2010.16 The plasmonic cavity consisted of a 235 nm-thick InP disk with four InAsP quantum wells (QWs) in the middle of the disk as an active medium (Fig. 2c, top left). The top of the disk was bonded to a transparent glass substrate. The bottom and sidewall of the disk were covered with silver, and the semiconductor-filled silver nanopan structure was expected to generate plasmonic modes. Numerical simulation showed that a whispering-gallery plasmonic mode confined at the bottom of the silver nanopan was excited, exhibiting a subwavelength mode volume of 0.56 (λ/2n)3. To fabricate this plasmonic cavity, InP disks were defined on the glass substrate using electron-beam lithography and a dry etching process; silver was then deposited on the disks. The bottom surface roughness of the silver nanopan (rms = 0.59 nm) was similar to that of the epitaxial InP disk surface (rms = 0.22 nm). Such a smooth metal surface is critical for reducing the scattering loss and increasing the plasmonic propagation length, resulting in high-Q plasmonic modes at the bottom of the nanopan. Optical pumping and PL measurements were performed at 8 K, through the glass substrate on top of the InP disk. Then, plasmonic lasing was demonstrated, as confirmed by the spectrum, mode image, and polarization state, as well as the good agreement with numerical simulation. In addition, a significant temperature-dependent lasing threshold for the plasmonic mode was observed. This unique feature contrasts and distinguishes plasmonic lasing from conventional optical lasing. As the temperature increases, the metallic absorption loss likewise increases the electrical conductivity. Taken together, the progress in demonstrating a subwavelength semiconductor nanodisk/nanopan plasmonic laser represents an important step toward the further miniaturization of coherent light sources and fast all-optical processing in an ultra-compact photonic integrated circuit.
2.3 Quasi-BIC nanostructures
To develop strong light–matter interactions, it is essential to utilize a high-Q nanocavity with a subwavelength-scale footprint.6,41 High-index single dielectric nanoparticles, such as nanospheres or nanocylinders, have attracted considerable attention as a new platform for nanophotonics.54–56 The low material losses and availability for engineering artificial magnetic responses in a simple dielectric resonator allow these materials to be used as basic building blocks for nanophotonic circuits. However, in general, the resonant modes in a single dielectric nanoparticle have low Q factors because the response of dielectric nanoparticles is governed by low-order geometrical resonances with large radiation losses.
In quantum mechanics, BICs refer to localized electron waves with energies embedded within the continuous spectrum of propagating waves.57 Theoretical studies based on mathematical solutions revealed that bound states present the novel mode features of having an infinitely large Q factor and vanishing resonant linewidth.58,59 Analogies of BICs to photonics can provide an excellent solution for realizing a high Q factor, even in a single dielectric nanoparticle.3,17,60–62 In practice, the implementation of BICs is slightly different from the theoretical expectation, and thus, the Q factor for a single nanoparticle is large but finite owing to the finite sample size, material absorption, and surface scattering. This constrained mode is known as a quasi-BIC.
Individual subwavelength dielectric nanocavities hosting a quasi-BIC resonance at telecommunication wavelengths were first demonstrated by our group and Kivshar et al. in 2020.19 This new class of nanocavities was developed by exploiting the mutual interference between coexisting strong electric and magnetic Mie resonances. Quasi-BIC with an enhanced Q factor was observed, accompanying the increased light–matter interaction. We investigated the optical modes in a 635 nm tall cylindrical AlGaAs nanostructure placed on an engineered three-layer substrate (SiO2/ITO/SiO2) (Fig. 3a). The selected pair of modes with uniform azimuthal field distribution was tuned, and the spectral mismatch could be decreased by changing the diameter of the nanocylinder. Such control of the structural parameters induced strong coupling between the modes and exhibited the avoided resonance crossing of the frequency curves as a unique feature of the quasi-BIC (Fig. 3b). The strongly coupled modes in the quasi-BIC regime are hybrid with a combination of radial or axial oscillations. A dramatic increase in the Q factor was achieved as a result of destructive interference between the radial and axial modes (Fig. 3c). The thickness of the SiO2 spacer on the ITO substrate was optimized at 350 nm to enhance the destructive interference of the two magnetic dipoles in the far field so that the Q factor was further increased. The measured Q factor for individual AlGaAs nanocylinders was 188 ± 5 for a diameter of ∼930 nm, which is in the quasi-BIC regime.

The high-Q quasi-BIC nanostructure can boost the nonlinear effects by increasing the efficiency of second-harmonic generation. The laser pulses in the wavelength range of 1500–1700 nm were incident on the nanocylinders with diameters varying from 890 to 980 nm (Fig. 3d). The measurement showed a sharp enhancement in the nonlinear signal in the quasi-BIC regime (diameter of ∼930 nm), selectively for the azimuthally polarized pump. We note that the incident beam was strongly coupled to the quasi-BIC mode, depending on the spatial overlap between the pump and the mode. Notably, the coupled power was resonantly enhanced depending on the polarization of the pump beam. The observed second-harmonic intensity for the azimuthal pump surpasses the second-harmonic intensity for the other polarizations by several orders of magnitude (Fig. 3e). This confirms the high spatial selectivity of the quasi-BIC mode.
Consequently, the designed AlGaAs quasi-BIC nanostructure functions as an efficient nonlinear nanoantenna for second-harmonic generation. The observed second-harmonic generation efficiency in the quasi-BIC regime was more than two orders of magnitude higher than that demonstrated in earlier approaches. The second-harmonic generation response was engineered using the structured polarized light and designed substrate. As a result, a record-high second-harmonic generation efficiency was achieved in the individual nanoscale resonator. Therefore, individual high-Q nanocavities with a subwavelength footprint can be used in specific applications to develop nonlinear nanoantennas and low-threshold nanolasers.
3. Nanocavity arrays and their applications
3.1 BIC cavities
Single-mode light sources with small active volumes operate with low power consumption, but suffer from low brightness in applications such as optical storage, information communications, sensing, and medical sciences. On the other hand, lasers with relatively large active volumes (e.g., band-edge-type photonic crystal lasers) show high output power, although the lasing threshold is also high.63–65 To obtain a high output power and low lasing threshold, an efficient method of suppressing the radiation loss needs to be devised in an infinite periodic array structure.
Recently, optical BICs have been proposed to address this issue.17,18,66–72 Despite being generated inside the continuum regime and coexisting with extended waves, the physics of BIC enables perfect light confinement without any radiation. In 2011, the simplest experimental picture was introduced using a 1D array of coupled waveguides.66 The periodicity causes backscattering of leaky modes, and their strong coupling in the high-symmetry points of momentum space induces destructive interferences. Destructive wave interferences, in which two waves are superposed in the continuum regime with out-of-phase difference, completely suppress the leaky radiative losses, resulting in an infinite Q factor. This specific state, which can be engineered by symmetry mismatch and interference, is called a symmetry-protected BIC (Fig. 4a).

Another example is tunable BICs.73–78 If the mode frequency in the continuous spectral range is preserved under time-reversal, in-plane inversion, and up-down mirror symmetries, BICs can be achieved not only at the Γ-point of the photonic bands (symmetry-protected BIC), but also at any certain wavevector point in k-space (tunable BIC) (Fig. 4b). In 2013, tunable BIC behavior was reported for a Si3N4 photonic crystal slab.73 These states were theoretically explained by their topological charges and polarization vector field, which describe the number of times the polarization vector winds around the BIC charges. Both types of BICs are topologically formed by the creation of vortex centers.77 By controlling the system parameters, the tunable BICs can move toward the central topological charge until they have the same wave vector. Such a shift in the topological charge of tunable BICs resulted in a new type of optical resonance, namely “merging BIC” (Fig. 4c). Engineering the topological configurations of BICs in this manner can substantially suppress scattering losses over a wide range in k-space. In addition, due to topological stability from merging BICs, the stable resonant system can be preserved, even if there are any perturbations or defects.
We note that photonic crystals are one of the most beneficial platforms for manipulating topological protection based on their symmetry at the wavelength scale. In particular, photonic crystal band-edge-type lasers exploit the symmetry-protected BIC; the group velocity decreases near the band edge and the coherent 2D distributed feedback effect is maximized over the emission area. Our group demonstrated a low-threshold photonic crystal band-edge-type laser using a rod array by optical pumping at room temperature.79,80 The laser structure consisted of a 20 × 20 square lattice array of InGaAsP iron-nail-shaped rods (Fig. 4d). Three pairs of InGaAsP quantum wells (QWs) with an emission peak at 1550 nm were embedded in the nail head of the rods as a gain material. The InP post underneath the InGaAsP nail head has a smaller radius compared to that of the nail head; thus, efficient vertical photon confinement in the nail heads could be achieved by isolating the optical mode from the substrate (Fig. 4d, inset).
The InGaAsP rod arrays were then embedded in a thin sheet of transparent and flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Fig. 4e). Because the applied mechanical strain induces structural modification of the photonic crystal and its band structures, the resonance frequency of the photonic band-edge laser can be shifted. Systematic exertion of an applied strain on the photonic crystal structure by gradual mechanical deformation of the PDMS substrate induced linear variation of the lattice constant along the direction of the applied strain. When a strain ranging from −10 to 12% was applied to the flexible photonic crystal laser, wide and deterministic spectral tuning (∼26 nm) of the lasing wavelength, with a sub-nanometer spatial resolution of less than ∼0.6 nm, was demonstrated (Fig. 4f). The sharp linewidth of the laser-enabled minimum detection limit of the strain was reduced to a sub-nanometer scale of 0.6 nm. Furthermore, a stable and deterministic strain-based pH sensor was demonstrated as a practical application by incorporating a flexible photonic crystal nanolaser with an opto-fluidic system. This flexible laser device can potentially be applied in detecting nanoscale alternation or mapping local surface strains of structures, as well as for measuring changes in the chemical properties of chemical and biological systems.
3.2 PT-symmetry coupled cavities
Non-Hermitian parity-time (PT)-symmetric optical systems have been explored in micrometer-sized optical cavities or photonic crystal defect nanocavities to control the intercavity coupling and asymmetric optical gain or loss.4 In the analogy between photonics and quantum mechanics, the interesting phenomena of non-Hermitian physical systems can be easily visualized in PT-symmetric optical systems. For example, exceptional points (EPs), unidirectional light transmission, reversed pump dependence of lasing action, and single-mode lasing with asymmetric optical pumping have been demonstrated.81–93 Such non-traditional mode controls provide new degrees of freedom for exploiting nanocavities in many applications in optical circuits and highly sensitive optical sensors.20,94–97
Photonic crystal cavities allow for clear mode identification with accurate analysis of unique lasing behaviors, near- and far-field mode profiles, polarization, and wavelengths. Notably, these cavities are useful platforms for non-Hermitian wavelength-scale optical systems. Our group demonstrated a non-Hermitian wavelength-scale optical system in two coupled photonic crystal cavities with a monolayer graphene sheet that partially covered only one cavity to provide asymmetric optical gain.20 The phase transition of the lasing modes and EP were clearly observed.
Coupled cavities consisting of two identical photonic crystal cavities, cavities 1 and 2, with optical gains of γ1 and γ2 and a coupling constant J (Fig. 5a) were examined. The calculated eigenfrequencies in this system showed interesting features, as γ1 and γ2 varied independently (Fig. 5b and c). Regarding the real part, Re(f), the modes were split into two different supermodes, bonding and anti-bonding modes, with identical optical gains (symbols). This frequency splitting decreased when the optical gain contrast, Δγ = |γ1 − γ2|/2, increased until Δγ = J. When Δγ > J, the supermodes coalesced. On the other hand, the behavior of Im(f) was opposite to that of Re(f). Re(f) and Im(f) are degenerate at Δγ = J (γ1 = 0.426 and γ2 = 1.106 THz or γ1 = 0 and γ2 = 0.680 THz), which are EPs. The calculated eigenfrequencies in the full-wave simulations agreed well with the results from the coupled mode theory in the non-Hermitian coupled optical cavities with asymmetric gains (black solid lines). Im(f) determines whether the supermodes can be amplified (Im(f) > 0) or dissipated (Im(f) < 0). Therefore, the bonding and anti-bonding modes in the unbroken PT-symmetry phase can be observed as cavities 1 and 2 provide zero or low gain contrast (Δγ < J). In contrast, a single amplifying mode in the broken PT-symmetry phase can be observed as the coupled cavities provide large gain-contrast (Δγ > J).

The distinctive lasing behaviors in the broken and unbroken PT-symmetry phases were experimentally demonstrated using the coupled photonic crystal cavities in the InGaAsP slab structure. The fabricated cavities were partially covered with a monolayer graphene sheet to provide asymmetric optical gain (Fig. 5d, inset). To observe the phase transition of the lasing modes at the EP with designed gain contrast, scanning PL measurements were performed (Fig. 5d). The spectra exhibited two different lasing peaks at wavelengths of ∼1505 and ∼1510 nm, as the pump laser was line-scanned from the left to the right cavity. The lasing peak at ∼1505 nm (black lines) started to appear at the pump position of xpump = 0.2 μm, whereas the peak at ∼1510 nm (red lines) was observed only in the pumping region of −1.0 < xpump < 0 μm. This trend was also observed in the peak intensity plot (Fig. 5e). From the mode images, we clearly identified the anti-bonding mode, the bonding mode, and the amplifying mode (Fig. 5e, inset). Notably, the EP at xpump = 0.6 μm was directly observed by demonstrating the phase transition from the bonding and anti-bonding modes (xpump < 0.6 μm) to the single-amplifying mode (xpump > 0.6 μm) by analyzing the lasing thresholds, mode images, and peak wavelengths. These experimental observations were also verified using the theoretical asymmetric gain model of non-Hermitian coupled cavities.
Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated the active tuning of the EPs by controlling the optical loss of graphene through electrical gating (Fig. 5f). Scanning PL measurements were performed, while a gate voltage Vg was applied to graphene. Then, the wavelengths of the measured lasing peaks changed at different Vg's, and EPs also shifted from xpump = 0.45 to 0.75 μm when Vg was varied from 0.0 to −0.9 V. This study suggests that the coupled photonic crystal cavities with electrically gated graphene are useful for building a powerful platform to investigate the unique features of non-Hermitian systems and for various applications such as on-demand selection of lasing modes and optical switching.
3.3 Photonic topological cavities
More recently, in photonic systems, light propagation without backscattering and defect/imperfection-immune operation has been pursued to develop an ideal light source. Such unique features are particularly important in nanolasers that are sensitive to small perturbations.
In solid-state physics, topological insulators are new material phases that have a bulk bandgap similar to that of an ordinary insulator, but have conducting states on their boundary; electrons only move along the boundary of the material.98,99 After the concept of topological insulators was introduced into photonic systems in 2005, a new branch of optics, called “topological photonics”, appeared and grew rapidly.5,21,100–102 By controlling the topological phases of photonic structures, the novel manipulation of light is possible, such as unidirectional propagation without backscattering and robustness against structural defects.103–108 These distinctive properties were observed in the topological edge state, in which light was localized at the interface between two different topological structures.
Wang et al. demonstrated the first topological edge-state waveguide in 2009 (Fig. 6a).103 Unidirectional propagation and immunity to backscattering against defects were observed for the 2D magneto-optical photonic crystal structure. In 2018, an all-dielectric magnet-free topological edge-state laser was reported (Fig. 6b).109 Bandres et al. fabricated an array of dielectric ring resonators with topological properties, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The ring resonators were linked by a set of hopping phases to establish a synthetic magnetic field. As a result, single-mode lasing of the topological edge state was demonstrated, with a higher efficiency than the topologically trivial lasing mode.

Recently, higher-order photonic topological corner states have been proposed, having lower dimensions than the edge states.110–114 Because of the possibility of light localization at a single point, the corner state is a candidate for a new nanocavity that is robust against defects, with a small mode volume. In 2020, our group demonstrated a topological corner-state laser based on a nanocavity.23 Theoretical analysis was performed to predict the existence of corner modes in the square lattice. The unit cell represents a symmetric quadrumer composed of four elements (Fig. 6c). A deformation of four elements in the unit cell changed the inter- and intra-cell coupling ratio, leading to the topological phase transition. The topological phase can be described by the vector Zak phase or the two-component bulk polarization (Px, Py).115–117 A corner charge, Qxy = 4PxPy, was defined by a double projection of the polarizations at the corners. Four multipolar corner modes protected by the topological invariant were predicted, which are termed a quadrupole, two degenerate dipoles, and monopole modes in the finite square lattice (Fig. 6c). These four modes were described by non-Hermitian coupled-mode equations to analyze their resonant frequencies and decay rates.
The topological cavity was fabricated using an InGaAsP slab (Fig. 6d). A topologically nontrivial domain consisting of two types of square air holes with side lengths (l1, l2) was surrounded by a trivial domain with an inverted order (l2, l1), and the finite-element method (FEM) simulation showed that topological phase transition between the two lattices occurred at the high-symmetry X point of the Brillouin zone. In the experiment, 6 × 6 topologically nontrivial unit cells were introduced. The lattice constants were 500 nm, l1 = 307 nm, and l2 = 158 nm. With 980 nm pulsed laser pumping at room temperature, four lasing modes were observed at wavelengths of 1539.6, 1546.1, 1549.9, and 1553.9 nm via hyperspectral imaging. These four modes were identified by measuring the mode images, lasing spectra, and light in-light out (L–L) curves, and by comparing the values with the calculated electric-field intensity profiles. The good agreement between the measured and simulated mode images indicated that the measured modes correspond to the corner-state quadrupole, dipole (d1), dipole (d2), and monopole modes, respectively (Fig. 6e).
In addition, to prove the robustness of the topological corner-state laser, numerical calculations and control experiments were performed. Multipolar corner-state lasing modes survived experimentally despite the existence of hole defects introduced at the interface between the trivial and nontrivial domains. Despite various defects, such as an air hole shape defect, air hole displacement and size irregularities at the interface, and bulk domain disorder, the robustness of the multipolar corner-state modes was confirmed via numerical calculations.
4. Conclusions
In this review, we outlined the operational principles and optical properties of single and array nanocavities. In particular, semiconductor nanowires, plasmonic cavities, and quasi-BIC nanostructures were introduced as single nanocavities. In addition, BIC cavities, PT-symmetry coupled cavities, and photonic topological cavities were reviewed as representative examples of nanocavity arrays.
Promising applications of these nanocavities were also introduced. Efficient photovoltaic devices were developed using core/shell nanowires with resonant absorption modes and optical antenna effects. Plasmonic lasers have been demonstrated to exhibit a subwavelength mode volume and a temperature-dependent lasing threshold. An individual subwavelength dielectric cavity hosting a high-Q quasi-BIC mode increases the second-harmonic generation efficiency. Additionally, high-Q BIC cavities demonstrated low-threshold lasing action. In coupled photonic-crystal nanolasers with asymmetric optical gains, phase transition of the lasing modes was observed at EPs by tuning the area of the graphene cover on one cavity. Finally, higher-order topological phases enabled strong high-Q lasing at the corners, allowing for localization with built-in immunity to disorder.
However, there are several issues limiting the practical applications of the nanocavities. For example, various electrically driven nanolasers need to be developed to better demonstrate the unique optical properties of the nanocavities. Except for the photonic crystal laser,42,46,118,119 it is still challenging to introduce a tiny and efficient current path in a nanocavity without the degradation of the Q factor. Also, heat dissipation of the laser device needs to be improved for room-temperature continuous-wave operation. Several types of nano-sized transparent electrodes were recently suggested to address these issues in nanolasers.120
In conclusion, the applications of various cavity designs and the corresponding underlying physics to single and array nanocavities enable the further development of promising nanophotonic devices. We believe that this review suggests a route for utilizing nanocavities to achieve strong enhancement of light–matter interactions with applications to nonlinear optics, nanoscale lasers, and quantum photonics.
