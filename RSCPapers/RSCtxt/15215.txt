The significance of the nitrogen centres for revamping the donating strength (ΔVmA) of D–π–A is scrutinized using molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) analysis at the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level of density functional theory (DFT). During the transformation of a donor (D) to D–π–A, a certain delocalization of electron density from D to π–A has occurred, and the change in the MESP minimum (ΔVmA) observed at the cyano region of D–π–A is related to the donating strength of D. Optical and photovoltaic properties are analyzed at the TD/CAM-B3LYP/cc-pVDZ/SMD//B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level. In D1–π–A to D18–π–A, ΔVmA is in the range −7.0 to −19.0 kcal mol−1 and the increase in donating strength is found to be proportional to the number of planar nitrogens in the donors. D12–π–A exhibited the most negative ΔVmA (−19.0 kcal mol−1), indicating the highest electron-donating strength of D12, whereas the least negative ΔVmA (−7.0 kcal mol−1) displayed by D7–π–A is correlated to the weak donating character of D7. By increasing the electron-donating strength of D in D–π–A, a red-shift in the absorption maximum (Δλmax) by 162 to 294 nm is observed. Further, the open-circuit voltage (eVoc) calculated for the D–π–A systems showed a strong linear relationship with ΔVmA. The LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy of all the D–π–A systems (−1.79 to −2.79 eV) is observed above the conduction band (CB) energy of TiO2 (−4.0 eV), which ensured a desirable electron injection efficiency (ΔGinject) for them. The analysis of the adsorption energy (Eads) of the D–π–A systems on the TiO2 semiconductor (D–π–A/TiO2) showed that D12–π–A has the highest adsorption stability. Improving the adsorption stability is better for improving eVoc and the power conversion efficiency (PCE). The maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) of the D–π–A/TiO2 systems ranges from 513 to 703 nm and all of them display a red-shift with respect to the bare D–π–A systems. The study suggests D12 as the most efficient photosensitizer for DSSC applications. Further, it deepens the understanding of the structure–performance relationship of D–π–A systems as photosensitizers.
Introduction
The utilization of a renewable source of energy, preferably solar energy, for the ever-growing energy demand could diminish global climate change, which leads to sustainable livelihood on earth.1–4 Since solar energy is the most abundant green energy alternative for the future energy crisis, more research efforts have to invest in the development of photovoltaic strategies based on solar power.1,3–5 Over the past three decades, the third generation photovoltaic technology employed in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has acquired a notable position over conventional silicon-based solar cells due to the simple synthetic strategy, easier structure modification, large absorption coefficient, and low production cost.3,5–11 The major components employed in a DSSC device include photosensitizers, electrolytes, and electrode materials; modifications in those components lead to the enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cell.12 Generally in DSSCs, Ru-based sensitizers have greater PCEs than organic dye sensitizers, which show a comparable PCE to silicon-based solar cells.3 Whereas, the highly expensive nature and rare chance of occurrence of Ru-metal mean that its practical application in DSSCs is limited.3,13
After the invention of the DSSC device by O’Regan and Grätzel in 1991,6 extensive research efforts have been invested in the synthesis and device modelling of metal-free organic sensitizers, which leads to the improvement of the PCE.13–21 Usually, organic sensitizers comprise a D–π–A framework where D, π, and A denote the donor, π-spacer and acceptor, respectively. So far large varieties of structural modifications in the D–π–A structural framework have been performed, reveal that tuning the donating strength of the donor could significantly influence the absorption range and photovoltaic parameters.12,22–29 In our previous study, we quantified the electron-donating strength of eight typically used donor systems, viz pyrene, perylene, chrysene, triphenylamine, carbazole, phenothiazine, julolidine, N,N-dialkylaniline, ullazine and coumarin, in the D–π–A system and revealed that julolidine and N,N-dialkylaniline based π–A systems are the most efficient sensitizers for DSSCs.22 For improved optical and photovoltaic properties of D–π–A systems the particular analysis recommends the incorporation of electron-rich heteroatoms (preferably nitrogen) in donors. The literature shows that non-planar donors, especially triphenylamine, carbazole and indoline, reduce the electron transfer ability and overall conjugation in the donor group with the π–A system leading to lower light-harvesting efficiency of the dye sensitizer.30,31 The mentioned reducing factors are rectified through the introduction of planarized nitrogen incorporated donors viz. ullazine and indolizine as photosensitizers.30–33 Further, the rational design of photosensitizers with nitrogen annulation at the bay region of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) system provides a remarkable PCE in DSSCs.34 For example, perylene based PAH systems as donors in DSSCs have disappointing PCEs,35–37 whereas an N-annulated perylene (NP) core as a donor with phenyl functional groups results in an improved PCE of about 10.5%.38 Later, Wang et al. modified the NP core with bulky substituents to obtain PCEs up to 10.4%.39 This re-engineered chromophore was again modified with an N-annulated indenoperylene unit as the donor and reached a PCE of 12.5%.40 The aforementioned studies reveal that structural modifications with N-annulation in PAH systems enhance the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) due to the planar structure. Also, the multiple substitution sites involved in PAHs increase the possibility of molecular engineering. Recently Subramanian et al. described that a more N-doped polyaromatic hydrocarbon analogue of ullazine contributes a large dipole moment and more planarization to the dye-sensitizers, thus resulting in higher light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) than the donors with a single N-doping site.25
In this context, the most significant approach for an efficient photosensitizer is the engineering of electron-rich planar donors. Correspondingly, it is worthwhile to evaluate the role of nitrogen centres in donors for enhancing the donating strength. To tackle the failings of the electron transfer ability and overall conjugation in the donor group with the π–A system, we designed eighteen electron-rich nitrogen incorporated donors (D1–D18) as dye sensitizers for DSSC application (Fig. 1). For the π–A framework, butadiene and cyanoacrylic acid have been considered. In our previous study,41 we proved that butadiene exhibits better electronic effect transmitting power than thiophene, furan and benzylic spacers. Hence, for better electronic charge transfer from D to A, a butadiene π-spacer and cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor have been considered.
 Fig. 1  Designed donor systems. The MESP minimum over the phenyl ring (VmD) is given in kcal mol−1. 
In the analysis, the D1–D5 donors are designed from known donor julolidine (Fig. S1a, ESI†), where the possibility of N-annulation in the julolidine core has been attempted (D1 to D5) to enhance the electron-donating strength of the designed systems compared to julolidine (the calculated electron-donating strength, ΔVmA, of julolidine by MESP analysis is −9.2 kcal mol−122). Julolidine is an N-heterocyclic aromatic compound which comprises alkyl bridges between amino nitrogen and ring ortho carbon atoms.42,43 Because of the high efficiency in energy conversion and fluorescent properties, julolidine derivatives have been used in the construction of dye-sensitized solar cells and photoconductive materials, as fluorescent sensors for bio-imaging, etc.44 The conjugation of the aromatic part of the molecule with its amino substituent is an indicator of the ability of the nitrogen atom to possess sp2-hybridization, which enhances the donating strength of this class of compounds.45 In D6–D10, five-membered rings at the aromatic ring system have been considered for N-annulation; those systems are derived from 1,2,4,5-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2,1-hi] indole (Fig. S1b, ESI†).43 Among the designed N-heterocyclic systems (D1–D10), some of the derivatives are known and they are the best candidates for intramolecular cyclization and for generating diboryne nanowires.46,47 Donors D11–D14 are designed from the electron-rich nature of the phenyl/π-system. According to various experimental and theoretical studies, the electron-rich nature of the phenyl/π-system could be fine-tuned by electron-donating substituents and hence the aromatic ring of 1,3,5-N,N-dimethyltriaminobenzene could be considered as the most electron-rich neutral six-membered ring.48 Previously, Suresh and Sayyed described that the electron density at the phenyl ring could be significantly improved by the treatment of N-heterocyclic ring substitution and they proposed two highly electron rich systems viz. D11 and D12 as shown in Fig. 1.48 Since those systems are considered as electron rich (involving six nitrogen lone pairs), we could test the suitability of those systems as photosensitizers for DSSC application. Finally, two, and four nitrogens have been integrated in D15–D18, where the likelihood of N-annulation has been attained through N-heterocyclic five and six membered rings.49,50
For evaluating the donating strength of the donors in D–π–A, the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from D to A has to be assessed. Here it has been quantified in terms of the change in the molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) minimum, ΔVm, at the cyano group of A. Very recently we proved that the MESP is an excellent tool to quantify the electron-donating strength (ΔVm) of D–π–A systems.22,26 It is a real physical property which is experimentally observable from X-ray diffraction studies. To understand the reactivity of molecular systems, theoretically derived MESPs have been extensively used in the work of Tomasi,51 Pullman,52,53 Politzer54–57 and Gadre,58–60 and the wide range of applications in chemical and biological phenomena shows the acceptability of this area of research. Further, our group has contributed to several applications of the MESP parameter in organic and inorganic chemistry and described that the MESP is an excellent tool for the prediction of structure–property relationships.61–71 In the present study the significance of N-annulation for improved optical and photovoltaic properties has been evaluated using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. Currently, quantum chemical calculations have emerged as an elementary tactic to identify potential sensitizers before long-running expensive synthesis.72–78 Thus our computationally engineered dye sensitizers could open up new synthetic strategies for the development of photosensitizers for DSSC application.
Computational details
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level have been conducted for the optimization of the ground state geometries of the D–π–A systems.79,80 It is substantiated that the B3LYP level is adequate for the explanation of the electronic structure of dye molecules in DSSC applications.26,81,82 The ground state geometries of all D–π–A systems after binding to the (TiO2)9 cluster are optimized at the same level of DFT with the LANL2DZ basis set for the Ti atom and cc-pVDZ for non-metal atoms.83 Vibrational frequencies are calculated at the same level and it is confirmed that there are no imaginary frequencies. Studies show that the (TiO2)9 cluster size is sufficient to model the dye–TiO2 interfaces for simulating the electronic structure, optical properties, and binding modes of TiO2.84 Frontier molecular orbital energies of all D–π–A and D–π–A adsorbed on (TiO2)9 cluster systems (D–π–A/TiO2) are reported for the ground-state geometries. The optical properties of the D–π–A systems before and after binding to the (TiO2)9 cluster are simulated using time-dependent DFT (TD DFT) at the CAM-B3LYP level85 on the ground state geometry with mixed basis sets. To account for the solvent effect (dichloromethane as the solvent), SCRF-SMD (self-consistent reaction field-density simulation model) incorporated in the Gaussian 16 suite of programs has been considered. The CAM-B3LYP exchange–correlation functional is widely used in theoretical calculations for the excited state properties and provides results that are close to experimental results.86–88 In our previous study, the absorption properties of experimentally known dye sensitizers have been benchmarked including julolidine based dye-sensitizers and it is found that the TD-CAM B3LYP/cc-pVDZ/SMD//B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level is adequate to describe the electronic, optical and photovoltaic properties.22 The higher excitation energy associated with the CAM-B3LYP exchange functional than the B3LYP functional can be attributed to the higher bond length alteration index (BLA) of D–π–A systems.26 Moreover, for the examination of the intramolecular charge transfer characteristics of D–π–A systems, molecular electrostatic potential based topographical analysis has been performed on the ground state geometry at the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level. All the calculations are performed with the Gaussian 16 program package.89
The molecular electrostatic potential (MESP), V(r), is an important property of a molecule that its nuclei and electrons create at every point r in the surrounding space, which is defined in eqn (1) as (1)where N is the total number of nuclei, ZA is the charge on nucleus A located at distance RA, ρ(r′) is the electron density of the molecule, and r′ is a dummy integration variable. In the equation, the sign of V(r) at any r depends upon whether the positive contribution of the nuclei or the negative one of the electrons is dominant there.
Results and discussion
MESP analysis of the donors
The MESP minimum Vm gives a clear idea regarding the most electron-rich region in a molecular system. In all the donor systems (D1–D18), an aromatic phenyl ring (shown in a red colour, Fig. 1) has been observed and Vm observed at that phenyl ring, VmD, has been considered as the donor strength of each system. The most negative Vm depicts the most electron-rich nature of the molecular system. From D1 to D5, a systematic increase in the N-centers (up to 5 nitrogens) is introduced and VmD reached −35.5 kcal mol−1 from −26.4 kcal mol−1. The more negative VmD in D5 (−35.5 kcal mol−1) than those of D1–D4 characterizes the more electron-rich nature, which can be attributed to the occurrence of five nitrogen centers. In the D6–D10 donors, an increase in the negative character of VmD (from −22.6 to −24.3 kcal mol−1) has been attained by a systematic increase of the nitrogen atoms (up to 5 nitrogens). Meanwhile, due to the presence of more pyramidalized nitrogens, the D6–D10 donors provide less negative VmD than those of D1–D5.
In the D11–D12 donors, imidazolidine and imidazole ring systems have been introduced at the 1, 3, and 5 positions of the benzene ring. In D11, the electron-rich aminal functional groups increase the electron density over the phenyl ring, resulting in a comparable VmD of −35.1 kcal mol−1 to D5 (−35.5 kcal mol−1). In D12 the conjugation in the CC bond enhances the electron density over the phenyl ring, leading to a more negative VmD (−41.9 kcal mol−1) than D11. Due to the reduced number of aminal functional groups at the phenyl ring, D13 shows a less negative VmD (−32.3 kcal mol−1) than those of D11 and D12. In D14, conjugation increases the electron density of the donor system, resulting in a more negative VmD (−36.2 kcal mol−1) than D13. It is noted that the imidazolidine and imidazole substituted donor systems viz. D12 and D14 exhibit more negative VmD than D5, which can be considered as their better donor strength. Finally, for verifying the effectiveness of the introduced strategy, the D15–D18 donors are examined. In D16 the increased number of N-alkyl substitutions at the phenyl ring resulted in a more negative VmD (−31.2 kcal mol−1) than D15 (VmD = −26.7 kcal mol−1). Compared to D15, a more negative VmD is observed for D17, which can be attributed to the presence of an additional two nitrogen centres. Finally, in D18 the additional two methyl groups at nitrogen atoms promote pyramidalization of the N-centres, resulting in a less negative VmD (−28.1 kcal mol−1) than D17.
Donating strength of the D–π–A systems
The influence of the electron-rich nitrogen lone pairs in the donors (D) for enhancing the electron-donating strength of the D–π–A system (ΔVmA) has been elucidated with MESP analysis. In D–π–A systems, the π–A linkage with the donor involves intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from D to A, and the transferred electron density accumulated at A depends on the donor strength of each system.22,26 The electron density distribution via ICT at various regions of a representative D–π–A system (D1–π–A), viz. D, the π-spacer and A, has been shown in Fig. 2b as the MESP minima at the donor VmD′, spacer VmS′ and acceptor VmA′. Since the π–A part (butadiene) involved in the study is the same for all D–π–A systems, the MESP minimum observed at the CN group of A has been considered as the reference VmA to evaluate the changes observed at that minimum with the attachment of D (Fig. 2a). Also, it is proved that one could take other Vm regions at A as the reference Vmviz. Vm(OH) and Vm(CO) for monitoring the changes at the respective sites due to the parallel behavior exhibited by those parameters.26 In the study, VmA′ (observed at the CN region) has been selected as the reference point due to the most negative Vm character.
 Fig. 2  (a) MESP isosurface at various sites of (a) the reference system, and (b) a representative D–π–A system, where the MESP minimum is shown in kcal mol−1. 
In Table 1, Vm values at D, the π-spacer and A of the D–π–A systems are reported along with the change in Vm at those regions with the attachment of π–A to D. The change in Vm occurring at the D site (ΔVmD) has been calculated by subtracting Vm observed at the donor (VmD) from the corresponding Vm observed at D of D–π–A (VmD′). Likewise, ΔVmS and ΔVmA have been calculated by subtracting Vm observed at the respective sites of the reference system (VmS and VmA) from the corresponding values of the D–π–A systems (VmS′ and VmA′). In the table ΔVmD ranges from 12.2 to 17.9 kcal mol−1; the positive ΔVmD value shows electron deficiency at D.

In all, the less negative Vm observed at the D site of D–π–A (VmD′) than Vm of the donor (VmD) confirms the ICT from D to A. Further, the ICT from D to A enhances the electron density at the spacer; the gained electron density at the spacer has been denoted as negative ΔVmS, which ranges from −6.0 to −16.3 kcal mol−1. As per ΔVmS, the highest electron-donating strength has been attained by the D5–π–A system while the least is possessed by the D8–π–A system. VmA′ ranges from −7.0 to −13.5 kcal mol−1. The donors having greater electron-donating strength exhibit a more negative VmA′. As a result, the change in the MESP appearing on the acceptor (ΔVmA) with the attachment of D to π–A has been regarded as the donating strength of the D–π–A system.22
In the D1–D5 based π–A systems, the least negative ΔVmA (−9.2 kcal mol−1) has been attained by the one nitrogen system D1–π–A, which shows its poor electron-donating strength. Also, from D1–π–A to D5–π–A, a systematic enhancement in the donating strength has been observed for an increased number of nitrogen centres (n = 1–5) and the most negative ΔVmA (−13.5 kcal mol−1) has been shown by D5–π–A (incorporating 5 nitrogen lone pairs). In D6 to D10–π–A the more pyramidalized nitrogen centres in the donors impart less negative ΔVmA in the range −5.9 to −8.4 kcal mol−1 than the D1–π–A–D5–π–A systems. In D11–π–A, the incorporation of six nitrogen lone pairs through imidazolidine rings at the phenyl ring enhances the electron density at the donor site, resulting in a ΔVmA of −13.7 kcal mol−1. Whereas, in D12–π–A, the conjugation in the CC bond (imidazole ring) enhances the electron density at the donor more than in D11–π–A, which leads to a more negative ΔVmA of −19.0 kcal mol−1. In the D13–π–A and D14–π–A systems, a relatively lower donating strength is observed in terms of ΔVmA (−7.9 kcal mol−1 and −9.7 kcal mol−1) than that of the D11 and D12–π–A systems. This can be attributed to their reduced number of nitrogen centres (4 nitrogens). Since the nitrogens involved in the D1 to D4–π–A systems are more planarized than those of D13 and D14–π–A, the former systems show greater electron-donating strength. The integration of four nitrogens at the donor enhances the donating strength of the D16–π–A system (−11.7 kcal mol−1) over D15–π–A (−8.2 kcal mol−1). Further, the nearly planar nitrogens involved in D16–π–A provide a similar donating strength −11.0 kcal mol−1 to D4–π–A (−11.7 kcal mol−1). D17–π–A with four nitrogen atoms incorporated through two fused six-membered rings at the phenyl ring attains a less negative ΔVmA (−8.5 kcal mol−1) than D16–π–A. The additional two methyl groups in D18–π–A at the nitrogen atoms are pyramidalized and lead to a less negative ΔVmA (8.1 kcal mol−1) than D17. Finally, from the elucidated examples it is clear that donors having more planarized nitrogen centres enhance the donating strength of the D–π–A systems. Among all, the D12, D11 and D5 based π–A systems are the best candidates for DSSC application.
Absorption spectra
In Table 2, the optical properties of the donor and D–π–A systems are given. Since we have used the same –π– and A units in all the designed D–π–A systems, the influence of π–A on the absorption maximum (λmax) can be considered the same for all donors, and the shift in the absorption maximum (Δλmax) occurring during the transformation of D to D–π–A can be recognized as due to the influence of the donating strength of the donor units. Δλmax is calculated by subtracting λmax of D from the analogous D–π–A system. For the analysis the HOMO → LUMO transition has been considered. The influence of the donor strength (VmD) on the λmax of donors is observed in the range 280 to 329 nm. In Table 2, when a donor changes to D–π–A, the absorption shifts to higher wavelengths in the range 454 to 619 nm. According to our previous study, Δλmax in the range of 162 to 294 nm can be recognized as due to the influence of the donating strength (ΔVmA) of the D–π–A systems.22 The significant correlation observed between ΔVmA and Δλmax with a correlation coefficient of 0.940 confirms the significance of ΔVmA to Δλmax (Fig. 3, deviations are neglected for the R calculation). It shows that Δλmax increases with enhanced donating strength of the D–π–A systems. In the table, the D1–D5 based π–A systems display a systematic increase in Δλmax (from 203 to 257 nm) which can be recognized as due to the enhanced donating strength of those systems with an increased number of nitrogen centres (n = 1–5). Among those systems, the D4 based π–A system shows greater Δλmax than D5–π–A, which displays a slight deviation in the correlation (marked in a green colour, Fig. 3). The lower Δλmax values exhibited by the D6–π–A to D10–π–A systems in the range of 171–202 nm are recognized as due to the lower donating strength of those systems. Compared to the D6–π–A to D10–π–A systems, the greater Δλmax in D11–π–A (245 nm) can be recognized as due to its larger donating strength. The presence of conjugation in CC bonds enhances the donating strength of D12–π–A, resulting in the highest Δλmax of 294 nm. The highest Δλmax (294 nm) can be attributed to the utmost ΔVmA and λmax of D12–π–A (619 nm). In the D13–π–A and D14–π–A systems, Δλmax values of 162 and 259 nm are observed with a λmax of 454 and 583 nm, respectively. In those systems a slight deviation in the correlation has been observed, which may be due to the poor oscillator strength (f → 0.03). The higher Δλmax of 227 nm in D16–π–A than D15–π–A (209 nm) can be spotted as due to the better electron-donating strength (because of the increased number of nitrogens (four)) of D16–π–A. In D17–π–A, λmax and Δλmax are 500 nm and 218 nm, respectively. Even though there is an equal number of nitrogens (four) in the donor site, the higher Δλmax in D17–π–A than D18–π–A (199 nm) can be recognized as due to the influence of more planar NH centres.

 Fig. 3  Correlation between ΔVmA and Δλmax of the D–π–A systems (the R value has been calculated by excluding the deviations shown in a green colour). 
Finally, for the dye sensitizers, the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energies are crucial for determining the efficiency of the sensitizers (Table 5). For the effective regeneration of the oxidized dye, it is important to have a HOMO energy (eh) lower than the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte (−4.8 eV). The eh values of the D3–D5, D11–D14, and D16 based π–A systems are in the range of −4.68 to −4.74 eV, lying above the redox potential of the I−/I3− electrolyte. It is therefore suggesting that the oxidized dye might not efficiently regenerate in those systems from the I−/I3− electrolyte. Whereas, for the rest of the D–π–A systems, eh (−4.82 to −5.29 eV) lying below the redox potential of the electrolyte facilitates effective dye regeneration. For the D1–π–A to D18–π–A systems, the LUMO energies (el) are in the range of −1.79 to −2.79 eV, lying above the conduction band (CB) energy of the TiO2 semiconductor (−4.0 eV), which ensures effective electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band. The HOMO–LUMO gap (HLG) energy of the designed D–π–A systems ranges from 1.64 to 2.65 eV and it shows a decreasing trend with increasing electron donating strength. In DSSCs, HLG values give a clear idea regarding the PCE of the dye-sensitizer. As per various theoretical studies, a lower HLG ensures better optical and photovoltaic properties, thereby improving the PCE of DSSC devices.90–92 Herein, we could recognize that the lower HLG energy obtained with D12–π–A (2.17 eV) is accompanied by the highest absorption maximum (619 nm), good adsorption stability (−28.6 kcal mol−1), and highest eVoc (2.21 eV). Consequently, among all, the D12–π–A system having the lowest LUMO energy (−1.79 eV) may provide a better PCE in DSSC devices.
According to the basic principle of DSSCs, when the dye molecule gets adsorbed on the TiO2 semiconductor, the interaction between the dye and semiconductor can shift their energy levels and prompt electron injection into the semiconductor, which is desirable for a better PCE.73 To determine the energy levels of the adsorbed D–π–A systems on TiO2, we have designed a bidentate bridging mode for binding the D–π–A systems on TiO2 (Fig. 4a). It has been reported that the bidentate bridging mode is the most stable adsorption mode for anchoring groups.93,94 Further, the LUMO energy levels (−3.50 to −3.79 eV) of the adsorbed D–π–A systems are deeper than the bare D–π–A systems (−1.79 to −2.79 eV) and ensure that the LUMO is above the CB energy of TiO2, which could promote efficient electron injection from the excited dye molecule into the CB of TiO2. The absorption properties of the D1–π–A to D18–π–A systems adsorbed on TiO2 are reported in Table 3. We denote D–π–A adsorbed on TiO2 as D–π–A/TiO2. The observed λmax in the range 513 to 703 nm is favourable for an improved PCE, and shows a red shift with respect to the pure D–π–A system. Among all, D12–π–A/TiO2 shows the highest λmax (703 nm), whereas D13–π–A/TiO2 displays the lowest λmax (513 nm). The HLG of the D–π–A/TiO2 systems ranges from 0.61 to 1.89 eV, indicating that the adsorption of the dye with the semiconductor significantly reduces the HLG related to the bare D–π–A systems. The electron density shifts in the D–π–A/TiO2 systems between the HOMO and LUMO are given in the representative example (D12–π–A/TiO2) shown in Fig. 4b. In all the D–π–A/TiO2 systems, the HOMO is localized on the donor region whereas the LUMO is distributed on TiO2. This kind of charge delocalization is anticipated for a better PCE of dye sensitizers.

Quantitatively, the adsorption stability of the D–π–A systems on the (TiO2)9 cluster has been evaluated using the adsorption energy (Eads), which is listed in Table 4. It is defined as Eads = Edye/TiO2 − (Edye + ETiO2), where Edye/TiO2, Edye, and ETiO2 denote the energies of dye/TiO2, the isolated dye and the TiO2 cluster, respectively.95 It is clear that a more negative adsorption energy could reveal higher adsorption stability between the dye molecule and TiO2. In Table 4, we observed that all the adsorbed systems that have a more negative adsorption energy contain greater N-annulation. Among all, the most negative adsorption energy (−28.6 kcal mol−1) is attained with D12–π–A/TiO2, which indicates the most stable adsorption. Apart from N-annulation, the adsorption stability increases with enhanced electron-donating strength of D–π–A. The excellent linear correlation between ΔVmA and Eads with a correlation coefficient of 0.947 confirms that the donating strength of the donor systems of D–π–A assessed in terms of ΔVmA is useful to assess the Eads values of the dye on the semiconductor (Fig. 5a). Since stronger adsorption leads to deeper LUMO energy levels, a more donating dye is expected to give higher adsorption stability and higher eVoc (Table 4 and Fig. 5b). In the D12–π–A/TiO2 system, the highest adsorption stability and eVoc (2.21 eV) have been observed, which predicts superior photovoltaic performance of the adsorbed dye.

Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic parameters of the D–π–A systems are listed in Table 5. The electron injection-free energy change (ΔGinject) is in the range −1.28 to −2.10 eV. It is defined as ΔGinject = Edye* − |ECB|,96–98 where Edye* is the excited state oxidation potential and ECB is the energy of the conduction band edge of the TiO2 semiconductor (−4.0 eV). Edye* can be calculated as (−eh – vertical excitation energy).96,99 The more negative ΔGinject will have more ability to inject electrons from the excited state of D–π–A to the CB of TiO2. Since ΔGinject is related to short-circuit current density Jsc, by improving the electron injection ability, an enhancement in the PCE can occur.6,22,26,98 Among all, ΔGinject is more negative in D14–π–A (−2.10 eV) while it is the least negative in D9–π–A (−1.28 eV). Further, it is noted that the donating strength improves the electron injection efficiency. The ΔGreg value measures the dye regeneration efficiency of the systems, which can be written as (Edye − 4.8) eV or (−(eh) − 4.8) eV.100,101 The smallest ΔGreg (−0.84 eV) observed in D12–π–A shows the highest dye regeneration efficiency, while the highest value 0.49 observed in D6–π–A indicates the lowest dye regeneration efficiency. Finally, the open-circuit voltage (eVoc = el − (−4.0))102 lies in the range 1.21 eV to 2.21 eV, which shows an excellent correlation with ΔVmA (Fig. 6), and suggests that eVoc increases with enhanced strength of the D–π–A systems. The correlation in Fig. 6 also suggests that the MESP approach offers an easy analysis tool for the quantification of the donating strength of D–π–A systems in DSSC applications, and the correlation plot provides a guideline for designing dye sensitizers for desirable photovoltaic applications.

 Fig. 6  Correlation between the donating strength (ΔVmA) of the D–π–A system and the open-circuit voltage (eVoc). 
In the analysis, the highest donating strength observed in D12–π–A correlates to the highest eVoc (2.21 eV). The pyramidalized nitrogen centres observed in D8–π–A retard the efficient electron injection to π–A, and it shows the lowest eVoc (1.21 eV) due to inferior donating strength.
Conclusions
Donor modifications, especially through the integration of electron-rich nitrogen atoms (N-annulation), significantly affect the structure–performance relationship of D–π–A systems for dye-sensitized solar cell applications. For tuning the electron-donating ability of D–π–A systems, eighteen electron-rich nitrogen incorporated donors are designed with butadiene and cyanoacrylic acid as a π-spacer and an acceptor, respectively. The implication of planarized nitrogens for improving the electron-donating strength (ΔVmA) of D–π–A systems is investigated using MESP topographical analysis, which states that the magnitude of ΔVmA increases with an increased number of planar nitrogens. The λmax values of the D–π–A systems are fine-tuned by the extent of π-conjugation and N-annulation in the donors. The significance of ΔVmA in shifting the absorption maximum (Δλmax) is confirmed by the linear correlation observed between ΔVmA and Δλmax. Regarding the frontier molecular orbitals of the D–π–A systems, the HOMO and LUMO energies are affected by the electron-rich nature of the donors in D–π–A. The sufficiently more negative LUMO energy of the D–π–A systems than the CB energy of TiO2 provides high electron injection efficiency. The open-circuit voltage (eVoc), and free energy of electron injection (ΔGinject) have been analysed for the D–π–A systems and reveal that eVoc is increased with enhanced ΔVmA. Also, the adsorption stability of the D–π–A systems on TiO2 has been evaluated and indicates that the adsorption stability (Eads) increased with enhanced electron-donating strength of the D–π–A system. Since adsorption of the D–π–A system on TiO2 shifts the LUMO energy, the stability of the D–π–A/TiO2 system affects eVoc and thus the efficiency of the solar cell. The strong linear correlation observed between Eads and eVoc proves this conclusion. Among all the cases studied, D12–π–A/TiO2 shows the highest adsorption stability; furthermore, D12–π–A displays the highest Δλmax, the best eVoc and the highest magnitude for ΔVmA. Consequently, from the aforementioned fundamental parameters, it can be concluded that the D12 based photosensitizer is very effective for improving the PCE. Also, the N-annulation design strategy will pave the way for attaining high efficiency in the field of dye-sensitized solar cells.
