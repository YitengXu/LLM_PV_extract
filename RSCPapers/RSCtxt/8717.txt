    , Accepted 2nd May 2017First published on 2nd May 2017AbstractOrganic π-conjugated small molecules and polymers, owing to their light weight, solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and large synthetic variety of finely tunable structures and properties, are promising semiconducting materials for a new generation of optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), field-effect transistors (FETs), photovoltaic devices and sensors. A vast library of π-conjugated systems have been synthesized through conventional tools of coupling (e.g. Suzuki coupling, Stille coupling) and have been used in the fabrication of organic optoelectronic devices. In recent years an emerging synthetic technique called direct C–H arylation has been extensively studied as a facile, atom-efficient and environmentally benign pathway for the synthesis of conjugated polymers and small molecules. C–C bond formation between two heteroaryls can be carried out via the activation of C–H bonds in a transition-metal catalytic cycle, thereby overcoming additional pre-functionalization steps involving toxic reagents. Direct arylation has been applied to a broad range of monomers and its reaction conditions have been optimized to produce defect-free polymers as well as small molecules that exhibit performances comparable with those made from conventional reactions. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in the synthesis of conjugated small molecules, linear polymers and porous polymers by direct C–H arylation. In particular, small molecules and linear polymers based on benzothiadiazole (BT), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), napththalenediimide (NDI), isoindigo (IG), thienoisoindigo (TIIG) and thienothiadiazole (TTD) are discussed in detail. Device performances of some representative polymers synthesized via direct arylation polymerization (DAP) in FETs and bulk heterojunction solar cells are summarized. We finally discuss the present challenges and perspectives of DAP towards future “greener” and more industrially scalable synthesis of π-conjugated semiconducting polymers for a variety of applications.Hassan BohraHassan Bohra received his B.Tech. degree in chemical engineering in 2014 from SRM University (Chennai, India).

1 Introduction
Organic π-conjugated small molecules and polymers have been investigated extensively in recent years for their application in light emitting diodes (LEDs),1–3 field effect transistors (FETs),4–6 organic solar cells (OSCs)7–9 and sensors.10,11 The discovery of conductivity in polyacetylene by Heeger, MacDiarmid and Shirakawa12 in 1977 opened a new era of organic electronics where the optoelectronic properties of semiconductors can now be integrated with solution processability, mechanical flexibility and synthetic variety13 of conjugated molecules and polymers. Several design strategies to tailor the properties of conjugated polymers for specific applications have been studied.7,14,15 An important example is the donor–acceptor (D–A) strategy in which electron-rich (donors) and electron-deficient (acceptors) moieties are used to tune the electrochemical properties and bandgap of the resulting material.16–18 This approach has been successful in producing polymers with charge-carrier mobilities as high as 14.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OFETs19 and power conversion efficiencies (PCE) as high as 11.3% in OSCs.20
Synthesis of π-conjugated molecules and polymers relies on efficient C–C bond formation between two sp2 carbons.21 To this end, several transition-metal catalyzed cross couplings such as Stille,22,23 Suzuki,24,25 (palladium-catalyzed)26 and Kumada27 (nickel-catalyzed)28 have been developed for the coupling of heteroaryl-halides with organometallic-heteroarenes. While these traditional coupling methods have been effective to synthesize a broad range of π-conjugated systems, they often require tedious preactivation of C–H bonds using organometallic reagents that are flammable (e.g. butyl lithium), nonstable, and/or highly toxic (e.g. organo tins).
We have been interested in an emerging synthetic tool called direct C–H arylation, which enables facile direct coupling of arylhalides with non-substituted heteroaryls without the need of preactivating the sp2 C–H bonds (Scheme 1).29–50 As a result, a variety of π-conjugated molecules and polymers could be synthesized via direct C–H arylation in fewer synthetic steps, without involving highly flammable reagents such as butyl lithium and highly toxic agents such as organotin that are often used in Stille coupling. Although the chemistry of direct C–H arylation had been studied for many years in the organometallic community for easier synthesis of small molecules with pharmaceutical applications,51–56 its application for the synthesis of π-conjugated semiconductors with optoelectronic properties has not received much attention until recently.29,32,33,37,41,57–59 Nevertheless, the economically efficient and ecologically green feature of direct C–H arylation has attracted a lot of interest in the past five years30 and has been demonstrated as an efficient synthetic tool for producing well-defined and high-performance π-conjugated materials. Several reviews, perspectives and highlights have been published on DAP.29–40,60 This review mainly highlights our recent advances in this emerging synthetic tool towards synthesis of conjugated small molecules, linear donor–acceptor alternating copolymers and π-conjugated 2D/3D networks using direct C–H arylation. We also shed light on the applications of linear conjugated polymers synthesized by DAP in OFETs and OSCs, as well as π-conjugated porous polymers in gas separation, storage and photocatalysis.

1.1 Mechanistic insight
The mechanism of direct arylation coupling has been the subject of several experimental61,62 and computational reports63,64 in the past two decades. Two pathways that have been widely studied are the electrophilic aromatic substitution and concerted metalation deprotonation (CMD). In 2000, Sakaki and coworkers reported a computational study of the C–H activation of benzene by palladium.65 They concluded that the heterolytic cleavage of the C–H bond in benzene occurs when an oxygen from bisformate complex decoordinates from the palladium centre to form an O–H bond, while the benzene C simultaneously coordinates with palladium, leading to the formation of a six-centered transition state. Over the next decade, Fagnou66,67 and coworkers corroborated these results and demonstrated the applicability of the CMD pathway to a wide range of heteroarenes.

Scheme 2 describes the common mechanism of direct heteroarylation by the CMD pathway for both carboxylate-mediated68 and carboxylate-free catalytic models.69 The reaction begins with the oxidative addition of the aryl halide bond (Ar1–Br) to the Pd(0) complex (Scheme 3) with bidentate ligands (L) to form an aryl–halo complex (1). Depending on the catalytic model, a carboxylate or carbonate ion coordinates with the aryl–halo complex to deprotonate Ar2 while simultaneously forming the Ar2–Pd bond, hence leading to the formation of the transition state. The concerted-metalation and deprotonation step distinguishes direct C–H arylation from convention C–C coupling. It should be noted that while most arenes follow the CMD pathway, the exact mechanism depends on the nature of substrates, ligands and solvents involved.52,70,71 The final product is formed by the reductive elimination of Ar1–Ar2 from palladium.

2.1 Benzothiadiazole-based small molecules
In an attempt to synthesize organic semiconductors via direct C–H arylation coupling, Horie and coworkers reported the synthesis of donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type small molecules based on benzothiadiazole (BT) and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT).72 4,7-Dibromobenzothiadiazole (1, Scheme 4) was reacted with two equivalents of CPDT in a ligand-free direct arylation reaction catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2 in DMF, resulting in the target product M1 (Scheme 4) in low yields (Table 1, Entry 1) and some oligomeric byproducts.

Wang and coworkers reported the synthesis of a series of thiophene-flanked BT derivatives (M2–M4, Scheme 4) via one-step direct arylation coupling between 2,7-dibromobenzothiadiazole and large excess thiophene.43 A phosphine ligand, (o-MeOPh)3P was used with Pd2dba3 in a nonpolar solvent, o-xylene, to obtain the target products in a moderate yield (Table 1, Entry 2) which was mainly limited by formation of some polymeric and oligomeric byproducts. Wang and coworkers also synthesized 3-hexylthiophene- and ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) flanked BT small molecules, M3 and M4, under reaction conditions similar to that of M2. Although the combination of Pd2dba3 and (o-MeOPh)3P in o-xylene assures good selectivity between 2- and 5-positions on thiophene, the relatively low yield of M4 could be attributed to its poor solubility and the formation of oligomeric/polymeric byproducts. These small molecular BT-core building blocks can be further polymerized together with dibrominated aryls through a facile synthetic route of direct arylation polymerization,43 which is further discussed in Section 3.
Sommer and coworkers also reported the synthesis of widely used D–A–D building blocks, M2 and M5, by reacting 1 with a stoichiometric excess of bare thiophene (3) or furan (6), respectively, in a phosphine-free scheme of direct arylation coupling catalyzed by Pd2dba3.73 Excess reactants afforded high yields without significant side reactions (Table 1, Entry 5 and 6). Although, no β-coupling was detected, Sommer and coworkers found that using 2-chlorothiophene (7) made the 5-position more reactive in the direct arylation coupling with 1, resulting in a higher yield of the target product (M6).74
Marder and coworkers reported the reactivity of C–H bonds in non-brominated, 5,6-disubstituted BT derivatives.75 A series of triads were synthesized from 5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and mono-brominated aryls using Pd(OAc)2/PtBu2Me·HBF4 as the catalyst/ligand pair (Table 1, Entry 8). The optimized reaction conditions resulted in target product (M7) in a yield as high as 96%. Further careful control of the reactant ratio enabled facile synthesis of unsymmetrical mono-substituted triads.76 An extension of this work was published recently in which similar reaction conditions were applied to 5,6-dicyano-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole to synthesize a BT-based small molecule (M8).77
2.2 Diketopyrrolopyrrole-based small molecules
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) was first discovered as an organic pigment. It has been increasingly employed as an electron-accepting building block for a series of high-performance conjugated polymers.78–84 While a majority of DPP-based small molecules and polymers were synthesized using conventional coupling techniques such as Suzuki coupling and Stille coupling, Marder and coworkers reported the first DPP-based small molecules synthesized by direct C–H arylation coupling.85 The direct arylation coupling between N,N′-dialkylated DPP and electron-neutral/rich monobromo aryls using Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst in the presence of potassium carbonate and pivalic acid in polar solvents (DMAc/DMF) gave products in yields of 40–80%. In addition, oxidative C–H/C–H coupling between N,N′-dialkylated DPP and electron-deficient fluorinated aryls, catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2/Ag2CO3 in mixed media of DMSO/DMF, resulted in the respective target products in obviously lower yields (20–80%) compared to the reaction with electron-neutral/rich monobromo aryls.
In a more comprehensive study, Chen, Jen and coworkers reported broadly applicable reaction conditions similar to those reported by Marder.86 Various derivatives of DPP such as C–H active thiophene-DPP, brominated thiophene-DPP and brominated phenyl-DPP were tested in a direct arylation scheme to produce a series of DPP small molecules in good yields. Chen's group has also studied the application of DPP small molecules in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). A bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell based on blends of a DPP trimer (M19, Scheme 17) and PC61BM gave a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 3.7%.87 Several reports of DPP-based small molecules using similar direct arylation conditions have been published since then and their applications in OSCs and OFETs have been demonstrated.88–91 Welch and coworkers have also reported the synthesis of several DPP-based small molecules by direct arylation and demonstrated their application as non-fullerene acceptors in BHJ solar cells.92–95 More recently, a perylenediimide-flanked DPP small molecule (M23, Scheme 17) was paired with the donor polymer PTB7-Th in BHJ solar cells to obtain PCEs as high as 5.6%.94
2.3 Naphthalenediimide-based small molecules
Although naphthalenediimide (NDI) polymers synthesized by DAP had been reported by several groups earlier, Horie et al. published the first study of NDI-based small molecules.96 A donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type building block was synthesized by direct arylation of dibromonaphthalenediimide with excess cyclopentadithiophene in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 (10 mol%), K2CO3 and pivalic acid in dimethylacetamide (DMAc) to give products in poor yields.
Kanbara and coworkers attempted the synthesis of a similar building block using ethylenedioxythiophene instead of CPDT.96,97 They found that by reducing catalyst loading to 2 mol% the desired product could be obtained in moderate yields. In 2015, Sommer and coworkers published the first report of optimized direct arylation conditions for the synthesis of high yielding NDI-triads.73 They attributed the poor reactivity of the C–Br bond of NDI in a Pd(OAc)2 catalyzed DAC scheme to the selective formation of hydroxylated NDI-products. Instead, using Pd2dba3 (5 mol%) in the presence of potassium carbonate and pivalic acid in toluene resulted in higher yields.
To expand the scope of NDI-based small molecules that are further functionalizable via direct C–H arylation, Wang's group49 chose a new core-expanded NDI derivative, naphthothiophenediimide (NDTI) – in which the fused thiophene improves the coplanarity between the NDI core and the linked aromatic units.98 The synthesis of D–A–D type NDTI triads from the reaction between N,N′-alkylated NDTI (11) with monobromofluorene (as shown in Scheme 5) yielded a mixture of mono- (M10) and di-substituted (M9) products, under the reaction conditions previously optimized in DAP of benzodithiophene with 1 which are discussed in detail in Section 3.2.42

2.4 Isoindigo- and thienoisoindigo-based small molecules
Many researchers have studied isoindigo (IG) and its derivatives of polymers and oligomers as materials for optoelectronics owing to its coplanar structure, narrow bandgap and broad absorption over the visible range. However, the majority of isoindigo or thienoisoindigo (IG or TIIG) small molecules and polymers reported have been synthesized by conventional cross-coupling reactions such as Suzuki or Stille coupling.99 Direct arylation has been only recently used to synthesize isoindigo-based small molecules. Welch's group synthesized an A–D–A–D–A type oligomer by coupling a monobrominated phthalamide derivative to a thiophene-IG core.100 SiliaCat DPP-Pd, a diphenylphosphine palladium(II) heterogeneous catalyst made from an organoceramic matrix, was used as the catalyst in the presence of pivalic acid and base to give products in high yields. These reaction conditions were demonstrated to be applicable to a wide range of acceptor cores such as DPP, NDI and BT in a later study.92
Thienoisoindigo (TIIG) is a derivative of isoindigo wherein the benzene ring is substituted with a fused thiophene moiety which allows for improved donor–acceptor interactions and better stacking of polymer chains due to the enhanced planarity of the TIIG unit.101,102 Moreover, the naked α-carbon of TIIG makes it an ideal candidate for use in direct arylation. C–H arylation of thienoisoindigo was first reported by Wang and coworkers wherein thienoisoindigo was reacted with excess monobrominated aryls in the presence of Pd2dba3 and (o-MeOPh)3P to obtain M11 and M12 (Scheme 6).46 All products were obtained in high yields under these reaction conditions. As an extension to their work on IG small molecules, Welch's group also synthesized a TIIG-based triad, M13, under the pre-optimized reaction conditions (condition B in Scheme 6).103 Recently, a TIIG-based small molecule synthesized by direct arylation was used as a non-fullerene acceptor in BHJ solar cells by Welch. PCEs as high as 0.4% were obtained when the donor polymer PTB7-Th was used.95

2.5 Thienothiadiazole-based small molecules
Like thienoisoindigo, thienothiadiazole (TTD) is a narrow band-gap acceptor molecule that remains largely uninvestigated in a direct arylation reaction. Although several TTD polymers and small molecules have been synthesized for applications in OPVs, the synthetic protocol has been limited to Stille,104 Suzuki105 or Heck106 coupling reaction. The first report of TTD-based small molecules synthesized by direct arylation was published by Wang and coworkers.47 A thiophene-flanked thienothiadiazole derivative (17) was reacted with an excess of monobrominated aryls to give D–A–D type triads in good yields using pre-optimized reaction conditions42 (Scheme 7). TTD was found to be highly regioselective under these reaction conditions as no β-substituted products could be identified. Moreover, donor–acceptor interaction between TTD and donor moieties of varying electron-donating strength results in a strong spectral shift towards low energy regions. As a result, small molecules with bandgaps as low as 1.38 eV were obtained through a facile synthetic scheme of direct arylation coupling.

3 Linear π-conjugated copolymers by direct arylation polymerization
3.1 Benzothiadiazole-based copolymers
Direct arylation polymerization involving dibromobenzothiadiazole (1, Scheme 8) was first studied by Scherf and coworkers107 as an alternative technique for synthesizing poly(4,4-dialkyl-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]-dithiophene-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (PCPDTBT) – a high photovoltaic performance polymer that had been synthesized by Stille or Suzuki polymerizations only.108,109 They found that using Pd(OAc)2 in the presence of pivalic acid in a ligand-free protocol yielded high molecular weight polymers (∼40 kDa) as opposed to trials where a ligand was used. In a separate study, the same group reported that ligand free conditions resulted in homocoupling defects in the polymer chain which could be suppressed by using certain catalyst–ligand pairs.110 Horie et al. further optimized the reaction conditions for the synthesis of PCPDTBT (P1, Scheme 8) to achieve molecular weights as high as 71 kDa (Table 2, Entry 1) but structural defects were not studied.111

Inspired by the earlier work by Ozawa112,113 and Leclerc,114 in 2014, Wang and coworkers42 reported a systematic optimization of the DAP between two benzodithiophene and benzothiadiazole derivatives (P2, Scheme 8), both of which remain among the most popular building blocks for a myriad of high-performance D–A alternating copolymers.115–120 A comprehensive screening of Pd catalysts, ligands, solvents, bases and phase transfer agents was carried out. The target polymers with Mn of 20 kDa and Mw/Mn of 2.3 were obtained under the optimal reaction conditions involving Pd2dba3 and (o-MeOPh)3P as the catalyst–ligand pair in the presence of pivalic acid and potassium carbonate in o-xylene at 100 °C (Table 2, Entry 2). The relatively high boiling point (144 °C) of o-xylene and its non-polarity enabled the efficient C–H activation of the benzodithiophene monomer without overheating the solvent and eased the potential scaling up of the synthesis. These optimized reaction conditions were later found broadly applicable to a variety of monomers,42,43,45–49 and even very recently for efficient synthesis of a series of D–A linear polymers for high-performance organic solar cells.121 In a later study, Wang and coworkers applied these conditions to the thiophene-flanked derivative of benzothiadiazole, 4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT).43 Addition of alkyl chains on the β-position of thiophene (23, Scheme 9) not only limited structural defects but also resulted in relatively higher molecular weight polymers (P4) owing to its higher solubility in the reaction media (Table 2, Entry 4).
 Scheme 9  Synthesis of thiophene-flanked benzothiadiazole (DTBT) based conjugated polymers by direct arylation polymerization. 
Sommer and coworkers used DTBT to synthesize an alternating polymer with carbazole (P5) by DAP and studied the structural defects in the resulting polymers.122 Polymers synthesized in the absence of ligand or PivOH/K2CO3 (Table 2, Entry 8) resulted in more homocoupling defects. Leclerc et al. synthesized a similar polymer (P5′) using the conditions described in Table 2, Entry 6 and with no obvious homocoupling defects.123 Several other polymers including P6 (Table 2, Entry 7) were also synthesized to demonstrate the broad applicability of the reaction conditions. Lee et al. reported a comparative study of DAP and Stille polymerizations for the synthesis of a series of DTBT based polymers with EDOT derivatives (Table 2, Entry 8).124 Although the molecular weights of all polymers synthesized by DAP were lower than Stille counterparts, the reaction conditions were found to be compatible with a variety of acceptor molecules.126
Non-brominated benzothiadiazole as a reactant in the scheme of direct arylation was initially investigated by Marder and coworkers75 as described in Section 2.1. Geng's group reported the synthesis of a BT-based polymer, P3 (Table 2, Entry 3) using 5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (denoted as 8) and dibromofluorene as comonomers.125
3.2 Thienopyrroledione-based copolymers
Thienopyrroledione (TPD) has been frequently used as an electron-deficient building block for the synthesis of D–A type conjugated polymers with high photovoltaic performances.127 In 2012, Leclerc et al. reported the synthesis of TPD polymers by DAP as an alternative to the more conventional Stille coupling.114 An alternating copolymer based on TPD and bithiophene was synthesized by DAP and Stille polymerization and the results were compared. Among the catalysts and ligand screened for the C–H activation of TPD, the Hermann catalyst (4 mol%) in combination with (o-MeOPh)3P (8 mol%) afforded a molecular weight of 56 kDa in excellent yields. Building on these optimized conditions, Leclerc's group also studied the effect of the heteroatom on the synthesis of TPD polymers by DAP and Stille coupling.128 Thieno- and furanopyrroledione (FPD) polymers synthesized by DAP were found to have larger molecular weights and narrower band gaps than their Stille counterparts. Synthesis of several TPD homopolymers129 and narrow-bandgap polymers130,131 has also been reported by Leclerc.
Ozawa and coworkers reported the synthesis of a series of D–A type TPD copolymers using PdCl2(MeCN)2 and (o-MeOPh)3P as the catalyst–ligand pair.132 Molecular weights as high as 68 kDa (TPD copolymer with propylenedioxythiophene) could be achieved by using only 1 mol% of the catalyst and ligand thereby reducing the palladium loading by 1/8 compared to Leclerc's conditions. In order to suppress the commonly encountered structural defects in DAP,122,123 Ozawa's group devised a mixed-ligand DAP protocol catalyzed by 0.5 mol% Pd2(dba)3. Co-ligands such as tetramethyl-1,2-ethylenediamine (TMEDA) in combination with (o-MeOPh)3P were able to completely eliminate branching and homocoupling defects and yielded soluble, high molecular weight products.133,134
Very recently, Dudnik et al. reported the synthesis of poly-[5-(2-hexyldodecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione-1,3-yl-alt-4,4′′-dodecyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene-5,5′′-diyl] (denoted as P55, Scheme 18) via DAP between N-alkylated TPD and dibromo-4,4′′-dodecyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene.121 The DAP under the catalytic conditions involving 0.5 mol% Pd2dba3·CHCl3, 2 mol% P(2-MeOPh)3, Cs2CO3 (3.0 eq.), 25 mol% PivOH in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2MeTHF) at 85 °C over 24 h gave the target polymer with Mn of 19.2 kg mol−1, Mw/Mn = 2.0 without any obvious structural defects compared to the same polymer synthesized via Stille coupling. The performance of P55 in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell devices is discussed in Section 5.
3.3 Diketopyrrolopyrrole-based copolymers
In recent years, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based polymers have been extensively developed by careful design of the polymer backbone and side chains to produce outstanding performances in OFETs135 and OSCs.135,136 However, the synthetic route to these materials has been dominated by conventional transition metal-catalyzed reactions such as Suzuki and Stille polymerization.137–142 In 2013, Kanbara and coworkers used a phenyl-flanked derivative of DPP to synthesize narrow bandgap polymers by direct arylation and study their performance in solar cells.143 Pd(OAc)2 (2 mol%) was used as a catalyst along with pivalic acid and potassium carbonate in a ligand free reaction to give polymers in high yields (96%, Mn = 18.1 kDa) with no structural defects. Similar reaction conditions have also been used to synthesize EDOT copolymers with a series of brominated DPP derivatives by Kanbara's group.144
Direct arylation polymerization with C–H active, thiophene-flanked DPP was first reported by You's group,145 wherein the synthesis of an alternating copolymer, P8 (Scheme 10a) was optimized (Table 3, Entry 1). These conditions were used to synthesize a series of polymers with other comonomers thereby establishing the first library of narrow bandgap DPP polymers synthesized by DAP, although homocoupling and/or branching structures were observed in some reactions. Performance of these DPP polymers in devices was not reported.

Wang and coworkers reported the synthesis of poly(DPP-alt-tetrafluorobenzene) via two synthetic routes: (1) from C–H active, non-brominated DPP (28) to give polymer P10 and (2) from brominated DPP derivative (37) to make P16 (Scheme 10).44 Among the catalysts screened for the synthesis of P10via Route 1 (Scheme 10), only Hermann's catalyst yielded high molecular weight products (Table 3, Entry 5) while other catalysts gave oligomeric products. In contrast, the polymerization of P16 could be catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2 only (Table 3, Entry 6). Structural analysis of P10 and P16 by 1H-NMR revealed that P16 (Route 2) suffers from a significantly higher degree of DPP–DPP homocoupling than P10 synthesized under the optimized conditions involving Hermann's catalyst in Route 1. The DPP–DPP homocoupling defects were also reflected from an obvious red-shift in the optical absorption of P16 compared to P10. P10 with Mn of 33.2 kDa exhibited a balanced ambipolar behavior in OFETs (discussed in detail in Section 5), therefore making DPP-alt-tetrafluorobenzene one of the few examples of DPP-based ambipolar polymers synthesized by DAP.
Structural defects originating from C–H DPP were studied in detail by Sommer et al. through the synthesis and characterization of an alternating DPP polymer with tetrafluorobenzene.146 Although unwanted C–H activation is absent, they found that polymers synthesized in ligand-assisted and ligand-free conditions both suffered from small degrees (<12 mol%) of DPP–DPP homocoupling which could be suppressed by increasing the phosphine content. These results are consistent with those obtained by Wang and thereby establish the inevitability of DPP–DPP homocoupling when C–H active DPP is used.
In an attempt to better understand the relationship between structural defects and reaction parameters in polymerizations involving brominated DPP, Wang and coworkers synthesized a hyperbranched DPP polymer using 37 as the only reactant.50 Systematic optimization based on catalyst, ligand, solvent and temperature revealed that the high molecular hyperbranched polymers were obtained when Pd(OAc)2 was used as a catalyst in combination with less bulky ligands in polar solvents and at high temperatures. These results provide important insights for minimizing homocoupling and β-branching in protocols where brominated DPP is used.
Leclerc's group also reported a comparison of the two synthetic routes to DPP polymers.147 Two analogous polymers, P9 (Route 1) and P15 (Route 2) consisting of the same repeating units were synthesized using optimized conditions. P9 was found to have a lower molecular weight which was attributed to homocoupling defects and the methyl inductive effect that reduced the reactivity or accessibility of α C–H bonds. In a separate report, they reported the optimization for the synthesis of a copolymer P14 (Table 3, Entry 2) via DAP between 40 and a brominated derivative (37) as described in Scheme 10 (Route 2).148 Another report of the comparison of the two routes was published recently by Li and coworkers.149 Similar to Leclerc's findings, polymers synthesized by Route 2 (P17) also exhibited a higher molecular weight and superior performance in OFETs.
Coughlin et al. reported the synthesis of a series of DPP copolymers with fluorinated and non-fluorinated comonomers for application in OFETs and OSCs.150 The highest molecular weight was obtained for a copolymer with thiophene (P12, Mn = 29.1 kDa) which also exhibited the best device performance (refer Section 5). Ling and coworkers recently reported the synthesis of a D–A1–D–A2 type polymer (P13) based on thiophene-flanked DPP and thiophene-flanked BT (36)151 (Table 3, Entry 10). More recently the same group reported DAP between similar DPP monomers and other acceptors such as thienopyrroledione and difluorobenzothiadiazole.152
3.4 Naphthalenediimide-based copolymers
Naphthalenediimides (NDIs) are one of the most investigated class of organic compounds owing to the ease of core functionalization and modification which translates into a high degree of modulation of optoelectronic properties.153,154 The electron-deficient nature of NDI makes them attractive candidates for n-type semiconductors in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and to that end several high-performance NDI polymers have been reported in the literature, the majority of which have been synthesized by conventional coupling reactions.155,156 The first synthesis of NDI polymers by DAP was reported by Horie and coworkers111 who used the optimized conditions for the synthesis of PCPDTBT (refer Section 3.1) to synthesize an alternating polymer (P18, Scheme 11a) with N,N′-dihexadecyl-2,6-dibromonaphthalenediimide (denoted as 44) and cyclopentadithiophene. Although successful, the polymerization only yielded low molecular weight products. Sommer et al. recently reported the optimized DAP protocol for P19, an alternating polymer based on NDI and bithiophene (Scheme 11a).157 1 mol% Pd2dba3 in the presence of potassium carbonate and pivalic acid at a monomer concentration of 0.5 M in toluene was found to yield the highest molecular weight polymers (31 kDa) with no evidence of homocoupling and branching defects. As an extension to this work, Sommer and co-workers also investigated the effect of solvent on the synthesis of P19 in a separate study and found mesitylene to be best aromatic solvent for minimizing solvent end-capping.158

Reaction conditions for P18: Pd(OAc)2, K2CO3, PivOH, NMP, 90 °C, 3 h; for P19: Pd2(dba)3, K2CO3, PivOH, toluene, 90 °C, 14 h. (b) NDI polymers synthesized from thiophene flanked NDI derivatives. 
Wang and coworkers reported the synthesis of narrow bandgap copolymers using a thiophene-flanked NDI derivative, DTNDI-Br (48) as the starting material.45 The reaction conditions and polymer structures are described in Scheme 11b. Pd2dba3 and (o-MeOPh)3P as in o-xylene was found to be an efficient catalyst–ligand system for the direct arylation of 48. Moreover, the extended conjugation of NDI with comonomers, especially thienothiadiazole, resulted in bandgaps as low as 0.93 eV (P22). All polymers were obtained in high yields. Mori et al. used a similar monomer to synthesize a perylenediimide–NDI–thiophene random copolymer in a recent report.159 Wang's group also reported the direct arylation of NDTI using the conditions described in Scheme 12.49 Unlike polymers obtained in Scheme 11b, P23 and P24 were obtained as oligomers probably due to the poor reactivity of C–H bonds in NDTI as described in Section 2.3.

3.5 Isoindigo- and thienoisoindigo-based copolymers
Isoindigo (IG) is one of the most widely studied acceptor molecules for polymer solar cells and thin film transistors.99 Several isoindigo based polymers and small molecules have been synthesized by conventional polycondensation reactions for photovoltaic applications.160–163 However, the use of direct arylation as a synthetic technique remains fairly new.164,165 Kanbara and coworkers first reported the synthesis of isoindigo (IG) copolymers by DAP in 2013.143 IG (49, Scheme 13a) was polymerized with a bithiophene derivative using 2 mol% Pd(OAc)2 in the presence of pivalic acid and potassium carbonate in DMAc to obtain polymers (P25) in good yields (Table 4, Entry 1). Leclerc's group reported the optimized synthesis of an isoindigo copolymer, P26 with thienopyrroledione (40).166 Optimized reaction conditions for TPD were employed and various ligands were screened to obtain high molecular weight products. Hermann's catalyst in combination with (o-MeOPh)3P was found to give the best results (Table 4, Entry 2). In an attempt to expand the scope of DAP, Leclerc and coworkers reported the synthesis of an isoindigo polymer in a continuous flow reactor – the first report of its kind for direct arylation. A D–A–D type polymer (P27) with EDOT as the strong electron donor and IG as the electron acceptor was synthesized.167 Ligand screening was carried out in batch reactions and P(o-anysil)3 was found to give the highest molecular weight (Table 4, Entry 3) for a reaction time of 24 hours. Lee et al. also reported the synthesis of the same polymer (P28) using Pd(OAc)2/(Bu)4NBr as the catalytic system in the presence of potassium acetate (Table 4, Entry 4).168 An EDOT-flanked isoindigo derivative was also used by Lee and coworkers to synthesize copolymers with 4,7-dibromo[c][1,2,5]-benzooxadiazole, -benzothiadiazole, and -benzoselenadiazole under the same conditions.169

Wang and coworkers recently reported the synthesis of a series of thienoisoindigo (TIIG) based polymers synthesized using the comonomers described in Scheme 13b.46 Reaction conditions for each polymer were optimized on the basis of the catalyst, ligand, solvent and temperature. High molecular weight products were obtained in good yields for polymers with fluorene (P29), carbazole (P30) and DPP (P31) when Pd2dba3 and (o-MeOPh)3P were used in the presence of potassium carbonate and pivalic acid in o-xylene. Although a lower degree of polymerization in P32, P33 and P34 under similar conditions was observed which could be attributed to poor solubility of the polymers due to the lack of long alkyl chains in the comonomers, these were the best conditions among all the trials. It is interesting to note that the best conditions for the synthesis of all TIIG polymers (listed in Table 5) are similar to those optimized for the synthesis of P2,42 which suggests the versatility of Pd2dba3/(o-MeOPh)3P for the C–H activation of both electron-rich and electron-deficient monomers.

4 Conjugated porous polymers (CPPs) synthesized by direct arylation polymerization
Conjugated porous polymers170,171 are a class of organic polymers characterized by large specific surface area, remarkable chemical stability and excellent electronic properties that have found applications in gas storage and catalysis.170–172 Electrochemical properties of CPPs can be tuned by proper selection of monomers from a vast library of π-blocks, but the synthetic approach to these polymers has been limited to conventional coupling reactions.173 Direct arylation, which has only recently been studied in the context of CPPs, allows for the facile synthesis of porous networks by reacting non-functionalized, C–H active monomers with multi-halogenated heteroaryls. Han and coworkers published the first report of conjugated porous polymers (CPPs) synthesized by direct arylation polymerization.174 Tetrafluorobenzene (42) was used to synthesize polymers with 1,3,5-tribromobenzene and tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)methane (Scheme 14) under DAP conditions optimized by Kanbara.175 The resulting polymers, P35 and P36, showed Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of 1170 and 1020 m2 g−1, respectively, which remain the highest values of BET specific surface areas for polymers synthesized by DAP till date. Feng and coworkers synthesized a polymer, P37 with tetrabromospirobisfluorene under Kanbara's conditions which exhibited a surface area of 700 m2 g−1. Recently, Koizumi's group used higher catalyst loading and an extended reaction time to obtain a polymer (P38) that exhibited a BET surface area of 258 m2 g−1.176
 Scheme 14  Synthesis of fluorinated conjugated microporous polymers by direct arylation polymerization. 
Very recently, Wang's group reported the synthesis of narrow bandgap CPPs via DAP involving thiophene-based monomers. In particular, porous homopolymers (P39, Scheme 15)48 was obtained via a facile one-step DAP involving 8,11-dibromodithieno[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine (60) as a single monomer building block under catalytic conditions with Pd2dba3 and (o-MeOPh)3P as the catalyst–ligand pair that was previously optimized in the synthesis of P2 (Scheme 8).42 Conjugated polymer networks with a narrow bandgap of 1.5 eV (Fig. 1a) and hierarchical porous structures (Fig. 1b) were obtained.

 Fig. 1  (A) Comparison of UV-Vis-NIR spectra of P39 with its monomer, 60. (B) SEM images of P39 show a hollow tubular structure. 
A series of thienothiadiazole (TTD) based conjugated porous polymers were also reported by Wang et al.47 Thiophene-flanked TTD is a narrow bandgap acceptor molecule and the active C–H bonds on the peripheral thiophene groups make it an attractive building block for narrow bandgap polymers by DAP. TTD was reacted with tritopic and tetratopic monomers (as described in Scheme 16) under the same reaction conditions as those used for M14, M15 and M16 (Section 2.4). Morphologies of the polymers were determined by the geometry of the aryl bromides used. P40, which consists of a planar benzene group in its structure, exhibited a thin fibrillar morphology (Fig. 2a) while P41 and P42 which are made of three-dimensional building blocks such as triphenylamine and spirobifluorene were found to have microspherical structures (Fig. 2b and c). Extended conjugation of TTD in the polymer network resulted in extremely narrow bandgap polymers with absorption extending in the NIR-region (Fig. 2d). While the porosities of these polymers (Fig. 2e) are relatively low, direct arylation opens up the possibility of incorporating a vast array of π-conjugated molecules in the polymer network for photocatalytic applications.

5 Conjugated polymers synthesized by direct arylation polymerization for optoelectronic applications
5.1 Linear D–A polymers
Conjugated polymers have been intensively studied as functional materials for organic electronics such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), field effect transistors (FETs) and photovoltaic devices in the past two decades.177 However, in recent years, the sustainable development of these materials by using eco-friendly methods such as DAP has garnered interest in the research community and to that end several polymers exhibiting impressive performances in OFETs and OSCs have been reported.21,178 A class of macromolecules that has consistently shown high performance in thin film transistors is DPP-based polymers179,180 and a significant contribution to DPP polymers and small molecules synthesized by DAP has been made by Leclerc's group. A summary of OFET performance of various DPP polymers is presented in Table 6. Polymers P9 and P15 synthesized by Leclerc exhibited ambipolar behaviour with dominant p-type character (μh = 0.92 cm2 V−1 s−1).147 Li and co-workers also observed ambipolar behaviour for polymers P11 and P17, although, the mobilities of P17 were an order of magnitude higher than that of P11 most likely due to the higher degree of structural defects in the latter.149 Wang and co-workers also observed ambipolar behaviour (μe = μh = 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1) in a D–A type DPP polymer (P10) synthesised by them.44 Recently, Geng et al. synthesised a donor acceptor polymer P56, consisting of fluorinated thiophene units in the polymer chain (Scheme 19a).181 Electron and hole mobilities of 4.19 and 3.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively have been reported for this polymer, which are the highest mobilities for polymers synthesized via DAP.

 Scheme 19  Benchmark high-performance polymers synthesized by DAP. 
Fewer NDI polymers synthesized via DAP in OFETs have been studied in OFETs (Table 6) compared to DPP polymers, though some significant contributions towards n-type polymers have been made. For example, Sommer's group achieved electron mobilities upto 1.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in top-gate bottom-contact OFET devices of an NDI-based polymer (P52, Scheme 18) synthesized via optimized DAP.182 Recently, Sommer reported an electron mobility as high as 3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for an NDI-bithiophene polymer157 (P19, Scheme 11a), which was comparable to the mobility of the same type of polymers synthesized via Stille coupling. Wang and coworkers also reported the OFET device performance of NDI polymers synthesized by DAP (Scheme 11b).45P21 and P22 exhibited only p-type charge transport in bottom-gate, top-contact OFET devices without encapsulation and tested under ambient conditions (Table 6).
Among the isoindigo-based polymers synthesised by DAP so far, Leclerc's group reported the highest electron mobility (7.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PCE (3%) for an isoindigo copolymer with EDOT (P27, Scheme 13a).167P26 synthesised by DAP and Suzuki polymerization exhibited an electron mobility of 2.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the DAP polymer which is comparable to the mobility of the Suzuki coupling product (2.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).166 Wang et al. also tested the OFET characteristics of the polymers (P32 and P34, Scheme 13b) synthesized by DAP. Both polymers showed hole mobilities at an order of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 6).46 Several TPD polymers synthesised by DAP183,184 have also been used to fabricate solar cells; however the PCEs obtained are moderate compared to the ones obtained from Stille polymerization.185,186
In recent years, DPP-based polymer solar cells have been optimized to exhibit PCEs approaching 10%. However, very few of these polymers have been synthesized by DAP.187 In a recent report, Leclerc et al. reported the synthesis of a phenanthridone-based random terpolymer, P58 by DAP (Scheme 19c) that exhibited PCEs as high as 6.3% (Table 7).188 Farinola and coworkers recently published a comparative study of the synthesis and OPV characteristics of a benzodithiophene-alt-TPD polymer (P45, Scheme 18) synthesized by DAP and Stille polymerization.189 Higher molecular weights were obtained from the DAP protocol (72 kDa vs. 34 kDa from Stille polymerization) and the PCEs for the polymer made by DAP were also found to be higher under various fabrication conditions (Table 7).

Very recently, Facchetti, Marks and coworkers reported a series of high-performance D–A alternating copolymers synthesized through a robust synthetic scheme of DAP using Pd2dba3/P(2-MeOPh)3 as the catalyst/ligand pair and 2,2-diethylhexanoic acid (denoted as DEHA) as the additive.121 The bulkier nature of DEHA compared to pivalic acid, a more commonly used acidic derivative in DAP, played a crucial role in improving the C–H selectivity while not compromising the C–H reactivity. P57 (Scheme 19b) synthesized under the optimized conditions of DAP showed a remarkably high PCE of 8.19% in BHJ photovoltaic devices, which is not only comparable to the PCE (8.24%) obtained for its Stille counterpart (P57Stille, Table 7) but also the highest reported for a DAP copolymer. Three other high-performance D–A alternating copolymers, including P55 described in Section 3.2, were also synthesized via DAP under conditions similar to those in synthesis of P57. All these polymers show structural, optical and photovoltaic qualities equal to or even better than the analogues synthesized via Stille polymerization. P55 synthesized by DAP exhibits a PCE of 6.86% which is only slightly lower (7.2%) than the same polymer synthesized by Stille polymerization (P55Stille, Table 7). These results not only cleared the prejudice that DAP produces conjugated polymers with inferior structural quality and device performances compared to those synthesized via conventional Suzuki or Stille polymerizations, but also demonstrated that rational optimization of reaction conditions in DAP as a cost-effective and eco-friendly synthetic approach can lead to high-quality polymers with large molecular weights, minimal structural defects, and thus high performances in optoelectronic devices.50,121,122,157
5.2 Conjugated porous polymers
Applications of conjugated porous polymers broadly include gas storage, heterogeneous catalysis and energy storage owing to their high microporosity, large interfacial area, tunable electronic structure and distinct morphology. A comprehensive discussion of design strategies and application of CPPs in the aforementioned areas is presented in reviews by Jiang170 and Antonietti.172 The first synthesis of CPPs via DAP174 (reported by Han et al., Section 4) exhibited high BET surface areas greater than 1000 m2 g−1 which are comparable to values of polymers obtained by conventional coupling reactions. P35 and P36 showed moderate values for the uptake of carbon oxide and hydrogen while a methane uptake capacity of 3.3% (by weight) was obtained for P36 which is higher than that of several highly porous materials. P36 also exhibited impressive toluene adsorption (10.6 mmol g−1) due to strong host–guest interactions. Sorption properties of polymers reported by Koizumi176 were also tested. However, the values of the BET surface area as well as CO2 adsorption were much lower compared to those of benchmark polymers.190 Application of CPPs as heterogeneous catalysts for organic syntheses either by encapsulation of metal co-catalysts in their pores or post-synthetic modification of the polymer structure has also been extensively studied.191 Conjugated porous polymers allow for the rational design of organic catalysts by selection of appropriate building blocks, thereby providing greater control on the optoelectronic properties. These features make CPPs promising alternatives to inorganic catalysts (e.g. platinum) that have been the standard.192,193
6 Conclusion and outlook
It is evident that direct C–H arylation coupling has been established as a mainstream synthetic technique for conjugated small molecules and polymers. Comparison of structural and optical properties reveals that polymeric products of direct arylation are comparable with those synthesized by conventional reactions.114,189,194–196 Circumvention of tedious synthetic steps and absence of toxic organometallic byproducts make direct arylation a lucrative alternative to Stille and Suzuki coupling reactions.
Nevertheless, some challenges remain in improving this synthetic technique. Although a variety of well-defined polymers nearly free of defects have been reported,40,42,43,45,46,112,113,123,197 structural analysis reveals that C–H/C–H and C–Br/C–Br homocoupling remains the major source of defects in some polymers synthesized by DAP under certain catalytic conditions.44,50,110,146 Rational optimization of both monomer structures (e.g. β-protection, and regioselectivity of C–H bonds198) and catalytic conditions has been proved to be crucial to minimize the potential structural defects involved in polymers synthesized via DAP. For instance, DAP protocols involving the Hermann–Beller catalyst and P(o-NMe2Ph)3 for the synthesis of P3HT have been rigorously investigated, resulting in nearly defect-free polymers with head-to-tail regioregularity as high as 99%.112,197 Another DAP protocol involving Pd2(dba)3/P(o-MeOPh)3 as the catalyst and nonpolar (e.g. toluene, o-xylene) to midpolar (e.g. THF, 2-methyl-THF) solvents as the reaction media has been proved highly efficient in the synthesis of a broad range of well-defined D–A alternating copolymers with minimal structural defects, even with arene monomers without β-protection.42,43,45–49,113,121
Broad applicability of reaction conditions to a variety of monomers is another milestone to be achieved. For instance, Fagnou's work68 on the importance of carboxylate additives such as pivalic acid in reducing the energy of the C–H bonds and acting as a proton shuttle between the C–H active species and the carbonate base has been the basis of developing reaction conditions for a variety of monomers.42,121 Currently, substrate-specific optimizations of reaction conditions are necessary to not only increase the yield of high molecular weight polymers but also suppress any possible side reactions. Careful selection of catalyst/ligand pairs for specific monomers can help improve the selectivity and reactivity simultaneously. For example, Ozawa, Leclerc and Wang have demonstrated that P(o-MeOPh)3 allows good regioselectivity for bromoarenes when paired with thermally stable catalysts such as Pd2(dba)3 and Hermann's catalyst.42,43,113,123 Therefore, optimization studies combining a mechanistic insight of the direct arylation reaction with organometallic design of ligands would be ideal for obtaining a versatile DAP protocol.
While the scope of direct C–H arylation is expanding rapidly to further simplify the synthesis of a broad range of π-conjugated molecules and polymers, the majority of DAP reactions reported so far remain in the category of step-growth polycondensation in which a careful match of stoichiometric ratios and high monomer conversion are crucial to achieve high-molecular-weight polymers, particularly when two types of monomers are involved in the polymerization. Further exploration towards chain-growth DAP for better control of molecular weight and chain-end groups is desirable. To that end, both rational design of monomer structures and careful optimization of reaction conditions will be necessary to meet the requirements for chain-growth DAP.37,200 There is no doubt that DAP will continue growing as a promising, economic, and eco-friendly tool for the synthesis of a broad range of high-performance π-conjugated polymers with tunable structures and properties for optoelectronic applications and beyond.
