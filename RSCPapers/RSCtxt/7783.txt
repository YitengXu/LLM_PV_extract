    , Accepted 3rd May 2017First published on 18th May 2017Abstract(LaTiO2N)1−x(LaCrO3)x continuous solid solutions with an orthorhombic-phase ABX3 perovskite structure and with varied LaCrO3 contents (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) were synthesized by a polymerized complex method followed by a post-treatment process of nitridation for the first time. Visible-light-driven photocatalytic H2-evolution activities of the solid solutions gradually increased with the increase of x from 0.0 to 0.3, and then sharply decreased with the further increase of x from 0.3 to 1.0. With the increase of x, on the one hand, the narrowed bandgaps of solid solutions would enhance the generation of charge carriers and the increased lattice distortion of solid solutions could promote the separation and migration of charge carriers, thus mainly contributing to the improvement of photocatalytic activities; on the other hand, the lowered CBMs of solid solutions would reduce the driving force for reducing H2O to H2 and the decreased surface areas of solid solutions would weaken the adsorption of reactants and reduce the reactive sites, thereby resulting in the deterioration of photocatalytic activities.
Introduction
Photocatalytic H2 evolution is accepted as one feasible and promising route to the conversion and storage of abundant solar energy into hydrogen.1–5 Until now, different kinds of materials, from semiconductors to molecules, or from inorganics to organics, or from the bulk phase to the nanoscale phase, have been developed to act as H2-evolution photocatalysts.1,6–11 However, the low H2-evolution efficiencies of photocatalysts, especially under visible-light irradiation, still remain a big problem that hampers industrial applications.12 Many modification strategies on chemical compositions, micro-/nano-structures, local lattice structures, and surface/interface structures, et al., have been adopted to optimize the photocatalytic process, which includes absorption of photons and generation of charge carriers (step I), separation and migration of the charge carriers onto surfaces (step II), and redox reactions of the charge carriers with reactants (step III),1,3,13 aiming to improve the H2-evolution activities of photocatalysts.6,14,15 Construction of solid solutions between end-member materials, which have analogous crystal structures but different electronic structures, is acknowledged as an effective strategy to adjust the chemical compositions and thus to develop novel photocatalysts.1,15–19 ABX3-type perovskites are considered as excellent end-member materials to construct the corresponding solid solutions with versatile properties due to the highly susceptible substitution of different ions at A, B and X sites.5,15,17,18,20,21
LaCrO3 has an ABX3 perovskite structure and a bandgap narrow enough to absorb visible light, but showed negligible H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation since the low conduction band (CB) level provided a weak driving force for reducing H2O to H2.18,22–24 Na0.5La0.5TiO3 has an ABX3 perovskite structure but has too wide a bandgap to utilize visible light.23,24 It was reported in our previous work that novel Na0.5La0.5TiO3–LaCrO3 solid solutions with an ABX3 perovskite structure were successfully developed by incorporating an LaCrO3 end-member material into an Na0.5La0.5TiO3 end-member material, and presented enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation.23,24 It was reported by other groups that LaTiO2N with an ABX3 perovskite structure and a bandgap of 2.1 eV exhibited photocatalytic activity for H2 or O2 evolution in the presence of the corresponding sacrificial reagents under visible-light irradiation.17,25–27
Herein, we tried to construct novel LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 solid solutions with an ABX3 perovskite structure by incorporating an LaCrO3 end-member material into an LaTiO2N end-member material, and to prepare the solid solutions by a polymerized complex (PC) method followed by a post-treatment process of nitridation, aiming to enhance photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation and to reveal the photocatalytic mechanism.
Experimental section
Preparation of samples

Chemicals. 
Methanol, citric acid monohydrate, tetrabutyl titanate, chromium nitrate nonahydrate and ethylene glycol were of analytical reagent (AR) grade and used as received from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate was of rare earth oxide (REO) grade and used as received from Alfa Aesar.
LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 continuous solid solutions with LaCrO3 contents (x) from 0.0 to 1.0 were prepared by a PC method,24,28,29 by which the corresponding oxide precursors were obtained, followed by a post-treatment process of nitridation.30,31


Preparation of oxide precursors. 
A series of oxide precursors for LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 continuous solid solutions were prepared by a PC method, and the detailed procedure is described as follows. Citric acid monohydrate (0.04 mol), tetrabutyl titanate (0.01 mol × (1 − x)), chromium nitrate nonahydrate (0.01 mol × x, x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6 and 1.0), lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (0.01 mol) and ethylene glycol (0.16 mol) were sequentially dissolved in methanol (50 mL) with magnetic stirring to form a clear solution, which was then sequentially heated in an oil bath in a fume hood at 70 °C for 4 h and 130 °C for 20 h with magnetic stirring to remove excess solvent and promote polymerization. The obtained glassy resin was then sequentially calcined in a burnout furnace at 200 °C for 4 h, 300 °C for 1 h, 350 °C for 1 h and 500 °C for 12 h to remove organics. The resulting powder was ground in an agate mortar and then collected for further use as oxide precursors to prepare LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 continuous solid solutions by nitridation.


Preparation of LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 continuous solid solutions. 
A series of LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 continuous solid solutions were prepared by nitridating the oxide precursors obtained above, and the detailed procedure is described as follows. The as-prepared oxide precursors (1.0 g) were put into a quartz boat and heated in an alumina tube furnace under an NH3 atmosphere at 950 °C for 15 h, with an NH3 rate of 300 mL min−1 and with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 from room temperature to 950 °C and a cooling rate of 3 °C min−1 from 950 °C to room temperature. A series of samples were thus obtained and labeled as LTON-xLCO (see Table 1), which corresponded to LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 solid solutions with LaCrO3 contents of x, i.e., (LaTiO2N)1−x(LaCrO3)x.

Characterization of samples
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical X'pert Pro MPD, Netherland) equipped with Ni-filtered Cu Kα irradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) and with a scan rate of 10° min−1 in the 2θ range from 10 to 80°. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (Shimadzu/Kratos Analytical Axis Ultra DLD, Japan) with a monochromatic Al Kα line source (hν = 1486.69 eV, 150 W), and all binding energies were calibrated using an adventitious C 1s peak at 284.8 eV as the reference. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using an FTIR spectrophotometer (Bruker Vertex 70, Germany) under a transmittance mode and in the range from 1600 to 500 cm−1. Raman spectra were recorded using a Fourier transform laser micro-Raman spectrometer (Horiba/Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR 800, France) under a backscattering mode and with an Ar+ laser as the excitation source (λ = 514.532 nm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectra and elemental mapping images were obtained using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-7800F, Japan). (High-resolution) Transmission electron microscopy ((HR)TEM) images were taken using a transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin, USA) with an accelerating voltage of 300 kV. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were measured using an accelerated surface area and porosimetry analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020, USA) by N2 adsorption after the degasification of samples at 110 °C for 5 h. UV-Vis spectra were recorded using a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-4100, Japan) under a diffuse reflectance mode and with BaSO4 as the reference.
Photocatalytic test of samples
The photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation in a sealed Pyrex glass cell (270 mL) with a side window for external light incidence. A 300 W Xe lamp with a UV-cutoff filter (λ > 420 nm) was used as the light source. Pt (1 wt%) as a cocatalyst was loaded on the photocatalyst by an in situ photodeposition method,24,32,33 and formic acid was used as a sacrificial reagent to react with photogenerated holes in photocatalytic reactions. The detailed procedure is described as follows. Photocatalyst (0.10 g) was magnetically dispersed into an aqueous solution that was composed of formic acid (20 mL), deionized water (180 mL) and an appropriate amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O. After purging with N2 for 15 min to eliminate air, the mixed solution was irradiated, accompanied by magnetic stirring at a constant rate and thermostatic circulating at around 35 °C by water. The evolved H2 was detected and quantified by a gas chromatograph (thermal conductivity detector, TDX-01 column, Ar as a carrier gas).
Electronic structure calculation of materials
The spin-polarized electronic structures of LaTiO2N and LaCrO3 and their solid solutions, by taking (LaTiO2N)0.5(LaCrO3)0.5 as an example, were calculated within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.34 Generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) was adopted to describe the exchange–correlation interaction.35 Projector augmented wave (PAW) potential was employed to treat the electron–ion interaction.36 A plane-wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 400 eV was used to expand the electronic wave function. The crystallographic unit cells of LaTiO2N and LaCrO3 and their solid solution are shown in the upper panels of Fig. 1, with 4 structural formulae in each unit cell. For the solid solution, the alloyed atoms, i.e., O and N, Ti and Cr, were uniformly placed in the current cells to mimic the randomness of a solid solution. The valence electron configurations of O, N, La, Ti and Cr atoms were 2s22p4, 2s22p3, 5s25p65d16s2, 3d24s2 and 3d54s1, respectively. A Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh of 5 × 5 × 5 was used to sample each Brillouin zone. The above three structures were geometrically optimized under the convergence conditions with a force of 0.01 eV Å−1 on each atom.

Results and discussion
Crystal phases

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns for LTON-xLCO samples. As observed from Fig. 2a, LTON-0.0LCO showed an XRD pattern that was well matched with LaTiO2N (JCPDS no. 00-048-1230; orthorhombic crystal system; a = 5.5780 Å, b = 5.5780 Å, c = 7.8880 Å), and meanwhile, LTON-1.0LCO showed an XRD pattern that was assigned to LaCrO3 (JCPDS no. 01-071-1231; orthorhombic crystal system; a = 5.5140 Å, b = 5.4780 Å, c = 7.7520 Å). The above results proved the successful preparation of LaTiO2N and LaCrO3 with a similar crystal phase, and further implied that the high-temperature NH3 atmosphere did not affect the formation of LaCrO3. Moreover, all other LTON-xLCO samples showed XRD patterns similar to those of LTON-0.0LCO and LTON-1.0LCO samples in the 2θ range from 10 to 80°, thus indicating the formation of novel single-phase materials, i.e., orthorhombic-phase LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 solid solutions. However, it is noteworthy that, as observed from Fig. 2b, the strongest diffraction peaks corresponding to the (112) planes in the 2θ range from 30 to 35° for LTON-xLCO samples showed gradual shifts to higher angles with the increase of x, thus indicating the gradual shrinkage of the crystal lattice due to the incremental incorporation of the LaCrO3 end-member material with a smaller unit cell size into the LaTiO2N end-member material with a larger unit cell size.

It was thus demonstrated that novel ABX3-type perovskite continuous solid solutions, i.e., orthorhombic-phase LaTiO2N–LaCrO3, were successfully prepared by a PC-nitridation process.
Chemical compositions
EDS spectra were employed to estimate the bulk compositions for LTON-xLCO samples, and the molar ratios of Cr/La in the final products are listed in Table 1. It was found that the molar ratios of Cr/La in all LTON-xLCO samples were in accordance with the molar ratios of Cr/La in the feed reagents, thus demonstrating that the chemical compositions of samples could be accurately controlled by the PC method.
Elemental mapping images were employed to observe the distributions of chemical compositions for LTON-xLCO samples, and the typical results, by taking those for LTON-0.3LCO as an example, are shown in Fig. S1.† It was found that all the elements (i.e., La, Ti, Cr, O and N) were homogeneously distributed in this solid solution.
XPS spectra were employed to determine the surface chemical compositions and oxidation states of LTON-xLCO samples. The binding energies of Cr 2p and N 1s levels for all LTON-xLCO samples are listed in Table S1.† The typical high-resolution XPS spectra of Cr 2p levels for LTON-xLCO samples (x = 0.0, 0.3 and 1.0) are shown in Fig. 3a. For LTON-0.0LCO, Cr signals were not detected due to the absence of the LaCrO3 component. For LTON-1.0LCO, two main peaks appeared at 576.0 and 585.7 eV and were assigned to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 levels of Cr3+,24,37,38 and two weak peaks appeared at 578.2 and 587.8 eV and were assigned to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 levels of Cr6+.24,37 It was thus indicated that the Cr element existed mainly in the form of Cr3+ since NH3 flow provided a reducing atmosphere and hence restricted the formation of Cr6+ at high temperature. In contrast, as reported in our previous work, the LaCrO3 material was prepared by a PC method followed by a post-treatment process of calcination in air at high temperature, thereby resulting in the existence of abundant Cr6+.24 Moreover, for LTON-xLCO samples with both LaTiO2N and LaCrO3 components, with the decrease of x, Cr3+ 2p levels shifted to lower binding energies (Table S1†), thus indicating that the construction of solid solutions changed the chemical environments around Cr, e.g., the increased amounts of N around Cr. The typical high-resolution XPS spectra of N 1s levels for LTON-xLCO samples (x = 0.0, 0.3 and 1.0) are shown in Fig. 3b. The N signal was not detected in LTON-1.0LCO, thus demonstrating that the high-temperature NH3 atmosphere did not affect the formation of LaCrO3 and failed to incorporate the N element into LaCrO3. However, N 1s signals appeared at around 395.4 eV in all other LTON-xLCO samples (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6) (Table S1†), and thus were assigned to N3−.31,39 The gradually decreased intensities of N 1s signals confirmed the decreased LaTiO2N contents in solid solutions with the increase of x.
 Fig. 3  High-resolution XPS spectra of (a) Cr 2p and (b) N 1s levels for LTON-xLCO samples (x = 0.0, 0.3 and 1.0). 
Consequently, the above analysis on EDS spectra, elemental mapping images and XPS spectra further confirmed the chemical compositions of LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 continuous solid solutions.
Local structures
Tolerance factor (t) was proposed by Goldschmidt to predict the degree of distortion for an ABX3-type perovskite with different A, B and/or X ions.40 The t value of an ideal ABX3-type perovskite should be equal to 1.0, and the degree of distortion for the existing ABX3-type perovskite was judged by the extent of deviation from 1.0 for the t value.41 The t values of LaTiO2N, (LaTiO2N)0.9(LaCrO3)0.1, (LaTiO2N)0.8(LaCrO3)0.2, (LaTiO2N)0.7(LaCrO3)0.3, (LaTiO2N)0.6(LaCrO3)0.4, (LaTiO2N)0.4(LaCrO3)0.6 and LaCrO3 were calculated to be 0.96902, 0.96897, 0.96893, 0.96888, 0.96883, 0.96874 and 0.96854, respectively (see the ESI†). It could be found that with the increase of LaCrO3 contents, the t values were increasingly deviated from 1.0, thus indicating the increased lattice distortion of the LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 continuous solid solutions.
IR spectroscopy is widely used to monitor the chemical and structural changes in materials.42Fig. 4 and S2† exhibited FTIR spectra in the range from 1600 to 500 cm−1 for LTON-xLCO samples. LTON-0.0LCO showed three predominant bands at around 577, 613 and 860 cm−1. For LTON-xLCO samples (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6), by taking LTON-0.3LCO as an example, the above three predominant bands appeared at around 582, 645 and 860 cm−1, respectively, and thus the former two bands blueshifted compared with those for LTON. Such band shifts were mainly ascribed to the change of chemical compositions in A, B and/or X sites and the further distortion of the crystal lattice by incorporating LaCrO3 into LaTiO2N to form LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 solid solutions. With regard to LTON-1.0LCO, the former two bands further blueshifted to 599 and 651 cm−1, respectively, and the latter band disappeared, due to the further change of chemical compositions and the further distortion of the crystal lattice as indicated by the t value far deviated from 1.0.
 Fig. 4  FTIR spectra for LTON-xLCO samples (x = 0.0, 0.3 and 1.0) in the range from 1600 to 500 cm−1. 
It is well accepted that Raman spectroscopy is extremely sensitive to the local deviation from average periodicity in materials and thus is valuable to probe the local structure.43Fig. 5 exhibited Raman spectra in the range from 200 to 1000 cm−1 for LTON-xLCO samples. LTON-0.0LCO showed two predominant bands at 384 and 526 cm−1. For LTON-xLCO samples (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6), the above two bands gradually became weaker but another two bands appeared at 750 and 854 cm−1 and gradually became stronger with the increase of x. Consequently, the gradual change of intensities for Raman bands implied the gradual change of lattice symmetry (i.e., the increased distortion of crystal lattice) in LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 solid solutions due to the gradual increase of LaCrO3 contents. With regard to LTON-1.0LCO, the Raman spectrum was distinctly different from those of all other LTON-xLCO samples, thus reflecting the different local structure in LaCrO3.
 Fig. 5  Raman spectra for LTON-xLCO samples (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6 and 1.0) in the range from 200 to 1000 cm−1. 
Combined with the above analysis on t values, FTIR spectra and Raman spectra, it could be deduced that with the increase of LaCrO3 contents, the crystal lattices for the as-prepared LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 continuous solid solutions became more distorted.
Textural structures
SEM images (Fig. 6 and S3†), (HR)TEM images (Fig. S4†) and BET surface areas (Table 1) were employed to combinationally analyze the textural structures of LTON-xLCO samples. LTON-0.0LCO was composed of porous aggregates with irregular shapes (Fig. 6a, b, and S4a†) and had a surface area of 8.8 m2 g−1. 3O2− in the oxide precursors were replaced by 2N3− during the nitridation process, which caused lattice shrinkage and therefore the formation of pores in oxynitride products.30 Compared with LTON-0.0LCO, LTON-0.1LCO showed little difference in morphology but had a larger surface area of 10.6 m2 g−1 (Fig. S3a and b†), thus implying that the incorporation of LaCrO3 with low contents into LaTiO2N was helpful to increase the surface area. However, with the incorporation of LaCrO3 with higher contents, the obtained LTON-xLCO samples (x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6 and 1.0) were composed of irregular aggregates with lower pore densities (Fig. 6c, d, and S4c†) and had gradually decreased surface areas. The decreased surface areas were mainly attributed to the lower pore densities, which were caused by the less contents of O2− replaced by N3− during the nitridation process. Eventually, LTON-1.0LCO did not show an obvious porous structure (Fig. 6e, f, and S4e†) and had the smallest surface area of 3.0 m2 g−1, thereby implying that the nitridation process had little influence on the formation of LaCrO3. Besides, clear lattice fringes corresponding to the (112) planes were observed in all LTON-xLCO samples (Fig. S4b, d and f†), thus confirming their high crystallinity.
 Fig. 6  SEM images for LTON-xLCO samples with x = (a, b) 0.0, (c, d) 0.3, and (e, f) 1.0. Scale bar: (a, c, e) 1 μm, (b, d, f) 100 nm. 
It was thus revealed that with the increase of LaCrO3 contents, the surface areas for the as-prepared LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 continuous solid solutions increased at first and then gradually decreased.
Optical properties

Fig. 7 shows the UV-Vis spectra for LTON-xLCO samples. LTON-0.0LCO showed a band-to-band absorption edge at around 600 nm corresponding to a bandgap of around 2.1 eV and presented strong background absorption in the region with a wavelength longer than 600 nm, which was consistent with previously reported results and demonstrated the ability to absorb visible light.26,44,45 Such a strong background absorption was generally observed in the LaTiO2N material prepared by nitridation under a high-temperature NH3 atmosphere and was ascribed to the surface states and defect levels formed during the nitridation process.26,44,45 Strong background absorption also appeared in LTON-xLCO samples (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6) in the visible-light region and interfered the determination of band-to-band absorption edges. LTON-1.0LCO also showed obvious absorption in the visible-light region, in which two absorption bands appeared at around 450 nm and 600 nm and were attributed to Cr 3d orbital-involved transitions in CrO6 octahedra.22–24

Electronic structures
VB (valence band) XPS spectra were employed to determine the VB electronic structures of LTON-xLCO samples, and the typical results for LTON-xLCO samples (x = 0.0, 0.3 and 1.0) are shown in Fig. 8.

The deduced VB maximum (VBM) values for LTON-0.0LCO, LTON-0.3LCO and LTON-1.0LCO were around 0.98, 0.87 and 0.41 eV (vs. the Fermi level (EF)), respectively, hence indicating that the VBMs of LTON-xLCO samples were gradually elevated (i.e., negatively shifted) with the increase of x. Such an elevation, i.e., negative shift, of VBMs would contribute to the narrowing of band gaps.
To further analyze the origin of change in the optical properties and the electronic structures for LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 solid solutions, by taking LaTiO2N, (LaTiO2N)0.5(LaCrO3)0.5 and LaCrO3 materials as examples, electronic structure calculations were carried out using the first-principles method and the calculated density of states (DOS) results are shown in Fig. 1. For LaTiO2N, the CB minimum (CBM) was mainly composed of Ti 3d orbitals, and the VBM mainly consisted of N 2p orbitals, and the bandgap was estimated to be 1.27 eV. For LaCrO3, the CBM was mainly composed of Cr 3d eg orbitals, and the VBM mainly consisted of Cr 3d t2g orbitals, and the bandgap was estimated to be 0.43 eV. Moreover, it was noted that for (LaTiO2N)0.5(LaCrO3)0.5, the CBM was mainly composed of Ti 3d orbitals heavily hybridized with Cr 3d t2g orbitals, and the VBM mainly consisted of Cr 3d t2g orbitals, and the bandgap was estimated to be 0.60 eV. It is well known that GGA generally underestimated the bandgap values.35 However, it is reasonable to predict the components and variation trend of electronic structures. It could be found that with the increase of LaCrO3 content in LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 solid solutions, the CBMs were gradually lowered (i.e., positively shifted) whereas the VBMs were gradually elevated (i.e., negatively shifted, as proved by the VB XPS results), thus gradually narrowing the bandgaps. Consequently, the construction of novel LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 continuous solid solutions was expected to be an effective strategy to optimize the electronic structures of LaTiO2N.
Photocatalytic activities

Fig. 9 exhibits photocatalytic H2-evolution activities for LTON-xLCO samples under visible-light irradiation. H2 was not detected in the absence of either LTON-xLCO samples or light irradiation whereas keeping other conditions the same, thus demonstrating that neither the photolysis of formic acid nor the non-photocatalytic effect (e.g., mechanocatalysis) of LTON-xLCO samples contributed to H2 evolution. LTON-0.0LCO showed a H2-evolution rate of around 6.0 μmol h−1 gcat−1, thus confirming the ability of LaTiO2N to produce H2 evolution photocatalytically under visible-light irradiation as proved in previously reported results.27,39 LTON-1.0LCO showed negligible H2 evolution, because the low CB level of LaCrO3 results in a weak driving force for reducing H2O to H2 although LaCrO3 has a bandgap narrow enough to absorb visible light. The above result was consistent with previous reports.22,24 For all LTON-xLCO samples, with the increase of x, photocatalytic activities gradually increased, and reached the highest H2-evolution rate of 20.7 μmol h−1 gcat−1 (around 3.5 times that on LTON-0.0LCO) on LTON-0.3LCO, and then sharply decreased. It was thus demonstrated that the construction of novel LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 continuous solid solutions based on LaTiO2N and LaCrO3 end-member materials was an effective strategy towards enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation.

Moreover, cyclic tests of photocatalytic activities were performed to check the photocatalytic stability of samples, and the typical result for LTON-0.3LCO is shown in Fig. 10. It was found that the photocatalytic activity showed a little decrease in 5 cyclic tests for 30 h, thus indicating the good photocatalytic stability of LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 solid solutions for H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity in each cyclic test for 6 h gradually decayed because Pt as a cocatalyst also promoted the back reaction of H2O formation to consume the evolved H2, especially when the concentration of evolved H2 increased.1

Based on the comprehensive instrumental characterization and theoretical calculations on the physicochemical properties and electronic structures of materials, such a change trend of photocatalytic activities on the as-prepared LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 solid solutions is explained as follows.
With the increase of x from 0.0 to 0.3, the gradually narrowed bandgaps of solid solutions, as indicated by the electronic structure calculations, would extend the band-to-band absorption of visible light and thus enhance the generation of charge carriers; furthermore, the gradually increased lattice distortion of solid solutions, as proved by t values, FTIR spectra and Raman spectra, would induce stronger dipole moments and thus generate stronger local internal fields that could promote the separation and migration of charge carriers.24,29,46,47 Accordingly, both the narrowed bandgaps and increased lattice distortion of solid solutions mainly contributed to the improvement of photocatalytic activities with the increase of x to 0.3. However, with the further increase of x from 0.3 to 1.0, the gradually lowered CBMs of solid solutions, as indicated by the electronic structure calculations, would reduce the driving force (i.e., the reduction ability of photogenerated electrons on CBs) for reducing H2O to H2;48 moreover, the gradually decreased surface areas of solid solutions would weaken the adsorption of reactants and reduce the reactive sites.1,6 Consequently, both the lowered CBMs and decreased surface areas of solid solutions mainly resulted in the deterioration of photocatalytic activities with the further increase of x from 0.3 to 1.0.
In order to further improve the photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared LaTiO2N–LaCrO3 solid solutions, systematic investigations are in progress on the abatement of adverse surface states and defect levels, which generally acted as the recombination centers of charge carriers and thus were detrimental to photocatalytic H2 evolution.1
Conclusions
A series of (LaTiO2N)1−x(LaCrO3)x continuous solid solutions with an orthorhombic-phase ABX3 perovskite structure and with varied LaCrO3 contents (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) were synthesized by a polymerized complex method followed by a post-treatment process of nitridation for the first time, and were employed as photocatalysts for H2 evolution under visible-light irradiation. It was found that the photocatalytic activities of the solid solutions gradually increased with the increase of x from 0.0 to 0.3, because the narrowed bandgaps of the solid solutions would enhance the generation of charge carriers and the increased lattice distortion of solid solutions could promote the separation and migration of charge carriers. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic activities of the solid solutions sharply decreased with the further increase of x from 0.3 to 1.0, since the lowered CBMs of solid solutions would reduce the driving force for reducing H2O to H2 and the decreased surface areas of the solid solutions would weaken the adsorption of reactants and reduce the reactive sites.
