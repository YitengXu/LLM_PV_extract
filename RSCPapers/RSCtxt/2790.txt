1. Introduction
Energy power has always been closely related to the world development and daily life. However, the energy consumption grew rapidly in the past decades, causing serious energy crisis. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy, 2019, the total world coal reserve to production ratio (R/P) is about 132 years, whereas the R/P of oil and natural gas is only about 50 years. Renewable energy, including wind and solar generation, hydroelectric generation and biomass energy, is a promising solution to this issue. Unfortunately, the share of hydroelectric generation in power generation is very low, considering the large volume on the earth. The ocean contains extensive underutilized resources and energy, and the total energy is evaluated to be 7.66 × 1013 W. To date, tidal and ocean wave energy are the most common forms. Despite many countries and companies having strained every nerve to develop power generation technologies, a tidal power station is still the largest contributor to ocean energy, which is based on the electromagnetic generator (EMG) technology. EMG consists of bulky metal components that impose manufacture and cost barriers for ocean energy applications. In addition, its conversion efficiency is relatively low at low ocean wave frequencies (<5 Hz) and in random motion mode, thus further restricting its commercialization process.
A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) can convert mechanical energy in the environment to electric energy based on the triboelectrification and electrostatic induction.1–3 TENG was first proposed by Wang et al. in 2012, with outstanding characteristics, including high energy conversion efficiency, ultrahigh output voltage, abundant material source, easy fabrication process, cost-effectiveness and good bio-compatibility.4 The energy conversion efficiency of TENG is defined as the ratio between the output electric energy and the input mechanical energy. Since the birth of the first TENG, significant breakthroughs have been made in many aspects. For instance, the output voltage and current reached up to thousand volts and milliampere levels, respectively, and the instantaneous power density and efficiency were demonstrated to be 50 mW cm−2 and 85%, respectively.5,6 Also, stretchable and wearable TENG with good biocompatibility has been reported, such as implantable or epidermal devices.7,8 TENG not only has the potential to provide an adequate power supply, but it also shows versatility in self-powered systems. Various structural designs based on the four fundamental working modes9–12 have been applied to harvest different kinds of energy such as human motion,13,14 wind energy,15,16 water wave energy,17,18 tidal energy19 and other types of mechanical energy.7,20
Recently, TENG applied to harvest the ocean energy, particularly the water wave energy, has become a hot research issue. Herein, the recent research achievements of TENG in ocean energy applications are reviewed, which concentrate on the various structural designs in macro-scale water energy and the perspectives in small-scale marine applications. First, the emphasis is on understanding the fundamentals of TENG and its advantages in harvesting the water wave energy. Then, the latest progress of the three categories, namely the water-involved TENG, the non-water-involved TENG and the hybrid TENG, for harvesting water wave energy has been expounded. In the next segment, the TENG for small-scale marine applications has been elaborated. Finally, we summarised the prospects and challenges for the macro-scale blue energy and small-scale marine applications of TENG.
2. Comparison of TENG with EMG
EMG based on the Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction has been used for harvesting the water energy for a long time. However, it is still unsatisfactory to harvest the ocean energy, particularly in frequencies below 2 Hz, irrespective of the progress been made.21,22 As a new energy harvesting technology, TENG has shown great potential for harvesting random water wave energy. Zi et al. have established an evaluation standard for quantifying the performance of TENG, through which they found that the contact-separation (CS) mode and the freestanding-sliding (FS) mode were better than other modes, such as the lateral-sliding (LS) mode and the single-electrode (SE) mode.23 Zi et al. comprehensively studied the influence of frequency on the characteristics of TENG and EMG, as illustrated in Fig. 1.24Fig. 1(a) and (b) demonstrate that TENG and EMG show the same movements in the CS and FS modes, respectively. Fig. 1(c)–(h) show the comparison of the measured performances. Clearly, the average output power density of these two devices enhanced as the frequency increased, but the value of the EMG was much lower than that of TENG, particularly in low frequencies (below 2 Hz). The average power-to-mass ratio exhibited the same trend. There are also other studies about the performance comparison of TENG with that of EMG, all of which convincingly reveal that TENG is more practical in converting the mechanical energy under low frequencies.

3. TENG for macro-scale blue energy
Classified by the storage form, ocean energy can be divided into thermal energy, chemical energy and mechanical energy, including tidal energy, ocean current energy and water wave energy. The major part that can be utilized by TENG is the ocean mechanical energy. Among these, the actual usable water wave energy is estimated to be up to 1 billion kW. Water wave energy is mainly the kinetic and potential energy of the water surface wave. The wave frequency is low and unstable, which poses great challenges for the traditional technology, such as EMG. Due to the unique characteristics, TENG is suitable for harvesting the irregular and broadband water wave energy. To date, considerable efforts have been made to develop higher efficiency TENG for harvesting the water wave energy while devising different prototypes. This section elaborates the recent progress in the perspective of the water-involved TENG, non-water-involved TENG and hybrid TENG. The performance comparison of the water-involved device is listed in Table 1.

3.1 Water-involved TENG
Typically, we preferred the TENG to work in dry conditions to prevent the charge dissipation. High humidity greatly reduces its energy conversion efficiency. However, water is the inevitable working environment in the ocean. Owing to the unique working principle, we can treat water as an ordinary material that contacts with another functional material. The first water-involved TENG was invented by Lin et al. in 2013.25 The novel prototype is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2(a). Here, water is considered as an ordinary insulating film. Under an external force, the patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and water were in contact, while the positive and negative charges distributed on the surface of the two materials. Once the force was released, the electric potential difference between the two materials could drive the electron flow between the upper and the bottom electrodes under the water. The maximum output voltage, and current and power density was found to be 52 V, 2.45 mA m−2 and 0.13 W m−2, respectively, which were enough to power 60 LEDs. Importantly, the output performance was significantly affected by the water that remained on the PDMS. Therefore, it was necessary to choose a hydrophobic material to maintain the output performance. After demonstrating that water by itself can be a friction material, they further studied its potential to utilize raindrop energy, as shown in Fig. 2(b).27 They adopted superhydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as the friction layer, thereby reducing the impact of the residual water. Before the raindrop could establish with PTFE, it was already electriferous on its descend. Besides, the working mechanism during the friction process with PTFE was clarified in detail. The output voltage, current and power of this prototype was 9.3 V, 0.017 mA and 0.145 mW, respectively.

Reproduced with permission.38 Copyright 2019, Springer Nature. 
Later, Zhao et al. and Zhu et al. demonstrated a thin-film TENG that could directly harvest the water wave energy, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d).26,28 Under the friction layer FEP or PTFE was the parallel electrode array. When the water wave emerged and submerged the electrodes, the electrons would flow between the electrodes under a potential difference. They also systematically investigated the relationships between the output performance and the factors including the electrode number, electrode density, wave speed and saltness of water. In addition, it was easy to scale up the film structure to get a higher output power.
In December 2016, Zhang et al. proposed a novel structure demonstrating that the water is packaged in a cylindrical box, as shown in Fig. 2(e).29 Under the external vibration, the water in the box would make a contact with the PTFE on both the sides and the PET on both the ends of the cylinder. Under a frequency of 3 Hz, they achieved an output voltage of 12 V and a current of 1.5 μA. The TENG could be used to detect the concentration of organics, such as dopamine and formaldehyde. Then, some derived structures, such as the buoy ball and the U-shaped tube, were developed to enhance the generated electricity.31,33,34 For example, Pan et al. designed a sandwich-like U-tube containing pure water.34 Under a frequency of 1.1 Hz, its voltage reached up to 350 V, while the power density was 2.04 W m−3.
Further, many other promising prototypes and applications have been reported by using the water-involved friction technology, as shown in Fig. 2(f)–(h).30,34–38 Xu et al. designed a wave sensor device that comprehensively studied the effects of the wave height and frequency on its output performance.35 Besides, a wave height sensitivity of 23.5 mV mm−1 demonstrated its potential applications in the environment monitor. Wang et al. proposed a tube-shaped TENG via a simple and cost-effective fabrication process.37 The device could harvest the flowing water energy, which was demonstrated as a self-powered visible light communication. In particular, Nie et al. proposed an interesting TENG based on liquid–liquid triboelectrification.38 The power was generated when a droplet passed through a liquid membrane, which demonstrated the potential for a permeable sensor.
Above all, these studies demonstrate the possibility of TENG for harvesting the water wave energy due to the liquid–solid friction technology. Nevertheless, it is can be clearly seen that the performance of TENG decreases when the friction material is directly immersed in the water for a long time. The humidity would alter the interfacial phenomenon of the friction effect in the ocean atmosphere, resulting in a quick dissipation of the friction charge density. Although the water is abundant in the environment, the material itself limits the triboelectric effects. Micro-nanostructures were usually introduced to enhance its output power.85,86 In addition, the effective contact area was relatively limited, and it was hard to scale up for a higher output power. Besides, the auxiliary equipment was usually indispensable to complete the whole triboelectric process. The complex fabrication process could reduce the performance–cost ratio, while introducing the recycling and environmental problems. Presently, most of the studies focused on the non-water-involved TENG in the water environment.
3.2 Non-water-involved TENG
The non-water-involved TENG usually consisted of a waterproof layer to isolate the device and the water. Clearly, we could easily reference and transplant the existing experience and achievements in a solid–solid friction field. Besides, a large amount of the prototypes is spring up. This part discusses these prototypes in detail, including the plane-structured TENG, the rolling spherical-structured TENG and the bionic structured TENG.

3.2.1 Plane-structured TENG. 
The first and the most classical structure is the CS mode. A plane-structured TENG based on the CS mode is easily constructed, and the output performance comparison of these TENGs is listed in Table 2. In November 2013, Hu et al. first developed a spiral structure to harvest the wave energy in the CS mode, as illustrated in Fig. 3(a).39 With the spring assistance, the upper triboelectric layer would periodically contact and separate with a bottom kapton film, resulting in the transfer of electrons between the Al electrode and Cu electrode. A buoy ball with a diameter of 14 cm could obtain a voltage and current of 110 V and 15 μA, respectively. Then, many other spring-assisted (SA) TENGs working in the CS mode were developed to increase the output performance.40,46–48

Sometimes, TENGs with other structures were adopted to directly harvest the impact energy from the water wave, such as the wavy-electrode (WE) and arch-shape.41,43,44 Jiang et al. designed an arch-shaped TENG using an ITO and a PTFE film with nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 3(b).43 The devices were supported by the substrates to directly harvest the wave impact energy with an output voltage and current of 210 V and 4.8 mA, respectively. Wen et al. also designed a wavy-structured TENG placed on the substrate to convert the wave impact energy, as shown in Fig. 3(c).41 The wave structure had the ability of self-healing, which could harvest the broadband mechanical energy from 5 Hz to 500 Hz. Furthermore, a hard ball was added to the system. In this structure, the ball would collide with the wavy-structured TENG and generate electricity instead of directly harvesting the wave energy. As shown in Fig. 3(d), Zhang et al. fabricated a dodecahedron structure with each plane being an individual TENG.44 Enhanced by the injection of electrons into the FEP friction layer and multiple structure design, the output voltage and current reached up to 260 V and 220 μA, respectively. Relevant theoretical studies had been made to render a good reference for the structural design.49,50 They constructed a model to analyse the relationship between the performance and the structural parameters via the FEM method.49 They systematically analysed the influence of the structural parameters, particularly the ball size, on the power density in horizontal collision, vertical collision and sloping collision. Finally, they found that the output performance increased with an increase in the ball diameter and then became saturated.
Besides, there are other types of TENGs, such as the disk structure and membrane structure, driven by air flow. Xu et al. introduced an air-driven membrane structured TENG.45 The working mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 3(e). As can be seen that the TENG units are separated in the original state, and the pressure difference will arise due to the shell movement pushed by the water wave, which can affect the distance between the TENG units. This device obtained an output current of 174 μA in the real water environment. Cheng et al. demonstrated a disc-shaped TENG driven by the air flow caused by the water wave, as shown in Fig. 3(f).51 The Cu rotator would rub with the PTFE, and the potential difference would drive the transfer of electrons between the two electrodes. An output current of 0.6 μA was measured at 2 m s−1, and the output performance increased with an increase in the airflow speed.


3.2.2 Rolling spherical structure. 
The energy harvest was hardly triggered by the water wave motion, particularly in the CS mode. Therefore, some rolling-structured devices were designed to effectively transfer and convert the low-frequency mechanical energy. Table 3 lists several typical TENGs. Wang et al. proposed a spherical shell containing a Nylon ball inside.52 The Nylon ball rubbed with the Kapton film in the wave condition, thereby resulting in the flow of electrons between the two electrodes anchored under the Kapton film, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The device could effectively utilize the energy in the frequency from 1.23 Hz to 1.55 Hz. In particular, an ultrahigh voltage of 12 kV and an output power of 10 mW were realized. Several strategies were introduced to enhance the friction effect between the freestanding balls and the supporting layer.53–57 Cheng et al. studied the influence of the ball hardness on the performance.55 The traditional hard PTFE ball is replaced by a soft liquid/silicone ball, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The soft core largely increased the contact area, resulting in a 10-time enhancement in the performance. In 2019, Yang et al. proposed a self-assembly of the TENG network that was realized by a self-adaptive magnetic joint.57 The individual TENG consisted of multiple FEP balls as the triboelectric material that will simultaneously roll on the 3D electrodes, as shown in Fig. 4(c). Four rotatable magnets on the shell could quickly rotate when the TENGs got closer, resulting in closely connected TENGs. The power density of the self-assembled TENGs of 4 × 9 array could reach up to 32.6 W m−3. In addition, other improved rolling spherical-structured TENGs are shown in Fig. 4(d)–(f), such as the tower-shaped TENG.

3.2.3 Bionic structure. 
In some cases, the intermediate component of the TENG could not effectively transfer the wave energy based on the above structure. Therefore, various bionic designs inspired by the biological structures emerged to more effectively convert the wave energy.58–62Table 4 compares the output performances of some of the representative TENGs. Ahmed et al. proposed a duck-shaped TENG inspired by the Edinburgh duck, as shown in Fig. 5(a).58,66 The TENG mainly oscillated in the pitch motion in the water wave, resulting in the balls to roll back and forth over the insulating film. The Nylon balls rubbed with the Kapton friction layer, resulting in the transfer of electrons between the interdigitative electrodes based on the FS mechanism. The duck made up of the four layers in parallel-connection could obtain an output voltage of 325 V and a current of 65.5 μA, respectively. In addition, the output power density could reach up to 1.366 W m−2 by integrating the 3 individual devices. Chen et al. introduced a bionic-jellyfish structured TENG based on the CS mode.59 As shown in Fig. 5(b), the device will be compressed and expanded withstanding different water pressures, resulting in a contact and separation process of the friction layers. A current of 11.8 mA m−2 was demonstrated in the practical experiment. Zhang et al. proposed a snake-shaped device inspired by the Pelamis Snake Energy Harvester, as shown in Fig. 5(c).60 This device contains multiple segments supported by the springs that can enhance the movement of the segments, thus increasing the output performance. Under a water move, the segment would be inclined, resulting in the movement of the multiple balls. They also decreased the dielectric shielding effects of the water by inducing an air gap, which significantly increased the performance. Wang et al. introduced a kelp-inspired TENG based on an SE mode.61 As shown in Fig. 5(d), the structure contains multiple freestanding strips, and they establish contact and friction with each other in the water wave. The single unit could obtain a voltage of 260 V and an output current of 10 μA at 1 Hz, respectively. In addition, it showed the potential to generate more power by integrating more units. Lei et al. proposed a butterfly-inspired TENG containing four-bar linkage based on the CS mode, as shown in Fig. 5(e).62 The device can work in two modes: flapping mode and swing movement, which can harvest the multidirectional wave energy. They characterized TENG in the water wave from 1 to 2 Hz and found that the output voltage and the current reached up to 707.1 V and 75.35 μA at 1.25 Hz, respectively.

Besides the above biology-inspired structure, several other novel structures also exist. For example, Zhong et al. fabricated a book-shaped TENG working on the roll-swing mode, as shown in Fig. 5(f).63 In this mode, the 50 units of the device would contact and separate with the nearest unit. An output current of 0.22 mA and a peak power density of 7.45 W m−3 were measured at 0.588 Hz, respectively. Lin et al. fabricated a super-durable TENG inspired by the pendulum based on the FS mode, as shown in Fig. 5(g).64 This pendulum can effectively transfer the wave energy into potential energy, which is very sensitive to the random swing motion. The traditional frictional layer was replaced by thin strips that significantly increased the durability and robustness.

3.3 Hybrid TENG
In the real water environment, the wave direction, frequency and amplitude are not fixed. It is hard to effectively harvest the random wave energy via only one strategy. By integrating TENG with the other energy harvesting methods, the hybrid nanogenerator will combine their unique advantages. This section introduces the two important hybrid TENGs. One is the TENG with various working modes and the other combines the TENG and EMG. The output performance comparison of the hybrid TENGs is listed in Table 5.

3.3.1 Multiple TENGs working in different modes. 
The hybridization of TENGs working in different modes has a capacity to utilize low-frequency random wave energy. In October 2014, Su et al. proposed a prototype of hybrid TENG, combining the water-involved TENG and impact-TENG, which could utilize the electrostatic and mechanical energy simultaneously.67 The device structure is illustrated in Fig. 6(a). Lee et al. fabricated a spherical hybrid TENG that can work in the SE mode, the FS mode and water-involved triboelectrification mode, as shown in Fig. 6(b).68 The advantage of this TENG is the easy construction process, which contributes to the commercialization. In 2019, Liu et al. proposed an optimized oblate spheroidal TENG that can work effectively in the rough wave and small wave simultaneously.69 As shown in Fig. 6(c), the device is mainly made up of two TENGs, in which the upper portion is arch-shaped without a spring assistance and the bottom portion consists of a PET/Cu film and an FEP film, separated in the natural state. The two TENGs both work in the CS mode. The output voltage and the current were 72 V and 4 μA at a frequency of 2 Hz and amplitude of 20 mm, respectively. The oblate spheroidal TENG demonstrated its ability to work in all-weather environment.

3.3.2 TENG + EMG. 
In addition to the above-mentioned hybrid TENGs, there are lots of hybrid devices that consist TENG and EMG, considering their advantages in harvesting the low-frequency energy and high-frequency energy, respectively.17,70–81 The hybridization of the TENG and EMG is promising to convert the broadband wave energy. For example, in 2019, Wang et al. demonstrated a ship-structured hybrid TENG, containing six CS-TENGs, FS-TENGs and EMGs.75 As shown in Fig. 7(a), the six CS-TENGs are located on both sides of the ship, while the FS-TENG consisted of three rolling cylinders and Cu electrodes in the bottom. The EMG is made up of Cu coils on the side and the magnets of the rolling cylinders. Fig. 7(a) schematically illustrates the working mechanisms of the hybrid TENG. The dependence of the output power on the frequency was studied and it was found that the peak powers were 0.165 mW, 0.8 mW and 9 mW for the FS-TENG, CS-TENG and EMG, respectively. Hou et al. fabricated a hybrid TENG consisting of SE-TENG and EMG based on the rotational pendulum structure, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The peak power density was 3.25 W m−2 and 79.9 W m−2 for the SE-TENG and EMG, respectively.77 Also, there are several other novel designed prototypes, such as the honeycomb and the pendulum structure, as shown in Fig. 7(c)–(h).

4. TENG for micro-scale marine applications
The TENG for blue energy conversion was proposed by Wang Zhonglin in 2014.82 However, TENG was originally intended to power portable electronics. In parallel to developing the large-scale blue energy harvesting, it is necessary to explore the micro-scale marine sensing applications based on the TENGs, such as marine environment monitoring and artificial marine monitoring. Clearly, the combination of TENG and various sensors as the ocean environmental monitoring system is promising. There exist some simple prototypes about the self-powered marine sensing systems. Fig. 8 shows the reported marine applications based on the TENG technology, including humidity sensor,20 corrosion protection,28 fishing sensor,31 wave sensor,35 permeable sensor,38 sea mark,39 electrochemical water treatment,43 fluctuation sensor,59 wireless transmitter,63 seawater desalination,75 acoustic sensor,76,87 temperature sensor,81 anti-biofouling sensor,83 and ethanol sensor.84 Although various prototypes mainly in the field of environmental monitoring and water treatment have been demonstrated, the self-powered marine sensing system is still in the stage of fundamental research. A breakthrough combating the encumbrances in the average power density, multifunctionality and stability of the system is essential.

5. Summary and perspective
This review first compared the characteristics of TENG and EMG, which emphasized on the relationships between the output performance and working frequency. It was found that the TENG had advantages, such as higher output performance and higher efficiency in low frequency, which were just suitable for harvesting ocean energy. Then, we summarized the latest progress in three categories, such as the water-involved TENG, the non-water-involved TENG and the hybrid TENG, for harvesting ocean energy. In this section, many prototypes with different structures and working mechanisms are listed in detail. To better understand the developmental progress of these devices, they are displayed in a chronological order. Fig. 9 shows the evolutionary history of TENG with different structures and performances.

The TENG has been demonstrated to be a promising candidate for harvesting blue energy. However, the total output power was still low due to the limited scale. The energy conversion efficiency and working scale should further be expanded for future applications. It should be noted that the TENG is not a replacement for EMG, but a supplementary technology for solving macro-scale and micro-scale energy needs. Although the macro-grid is still driven by the equipment based on the EMG technology, TENG has an advantage in powering distributed microelectronics. Furthermore, it is an indispensable picture puzzle in the ocean sensing network and intelligent ocean. The TENG for small-scale marine applications has been elaborated. By combining TENG networks, multifunctional sensors and wireless transmission, the self-powered marine sensing system can make breakthroughs in the ocean environmental monitoring. Towards the self-powered marine sensing system, numerous problems are required to be solved, such as improving the durability and stability of TENG, expanding the network scale, managing the electricity generated by TENG, optimizing the structural design and reducing the environment pollution.
