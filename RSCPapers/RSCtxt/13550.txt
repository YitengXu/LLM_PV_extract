    , Accepted 16th July 2009First published on 29th July 2009AbstractTransient absorption spectroscopy is employed to monitor charge photogeneration in polythiophene–perylene diimide blend films; in contrast to polythiophene–PCBM blends, efficient charge photogeneration is observed even for small energetic driving forces.
Reports of efficient photoinduced charge separation in solid-state films of conjugated polymers blended with fullerenes1,2 have attracted increasing interest due to their applicability to photovoltaic (PV) solar energy conversion. Currently, power conversion efficiencies approaching 5% have been reported by several groups for organic PV devices based on blend films of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and 3′-phenyl-3′H-cyclopropa[1,9](C60-Ih)[5,6]fullerene-3′-butanoic acid methyl (PCBM).3 The function of such devices is based on photoinduced charge separation at the polymer/PCBM interface. Efficient device performance requires a minimisation of the free energy required to drive the charge separation (−ΔGCS). We have studied the yield of this charge separation process for a series of different polythiophenes blended with PCBM, and concluded that efficient charge separation in such films required an unexpectedly large value of ΔGCS (ca. 0.9 eV).4 This observation has motivated us to investigate the generality of this requirement,5 and specifically to determine whether other material systems may be able to achieve efficient charge photogeneration without such a large loss of free energy. Here we report one such study, where we compare charge photogeneration in films comprising polythiophenes blended with either PCBM or an alternative electron acceptor, a perylene diimide (PDI).
PDIs are known to exhibit high electron mobilities6 and strong visible light absorption, as well as liquid-crystalline behaviour if appropriately substituted. Such materials have received significant attention as electron acceptors in vacuum-deposited bilayer photovoltaic devices,7 but only limited attention in polymer–small molecule blends, presumably in part due to the poor resultant device efficiencies, which have been attributed to blend morphologies incompatible with efficient charge transport to the device electrodes. Several approaches are being employed to address this morphology limitation, including for example the use of block co-polymers.8 In the study we report herein, we focus instead upon the underlying photophysics of charge photogeneration at the polymer/PDI interface.
We employed N,N′-bis[3,4,5-tri(n-dodecyloxy)benzyl]-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic perylene diimide (1)9 (Scheme 1), pristine films of which 1 can exhibit space-charge-limited current electron mobilities as high as 1.3 cm2V−1 s−1.9b A series of polythiophenes were employed as electron donors (Scheme 1). All films were fabricated as 1 : 1 blends. Control films employed PCBM as the electron acceptor. Some properties of these materials are summarised in Table 1.

Photoluminescence (PL) data were collected to evaluate the efficiency of exciton quenching for all blend films. PL data for a P(T10T10TT0)–1 film are typical and are compared to data for the pure donor and its blend with PCBM (Fig. 1). For all blend films studied herein, PL quenching was >65% for both polymer–1 and polymer–PCBM compared to the corresponding pristine films, indicative of efficient exciton diffusion to, and quenching at, the donor/acceptor interface. However, as we have shown previously,4 such PL quenching is not a reliable indicator of the generation of fully dissociated charges, due to the potential for geminate recombination of initially generated electron–hole pairs prior to their dissociation into separated charges. To address this issue, we employed transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) to monitor the yields of long-lived, dissociated charges observed on the μs timescale (which correspond to the typical time scale for charge collection in polymer–fullerene devices10).
 Fig. 1  Typical photoluminescence data for pristine P(T10T10TT0), P(T10T10TT0)–1 and P(T10T10TT0)–PCBM 1 : 1 blend films. 
Previously reported estimates of the film electron affinities (EA) of PCBM and 1 as 3.7 eV and 3.3 eV, respectively,12,13 suggest that PCBM is a stronger electron acceptor than 1 but were obtained using different electrochemically-based approaches. In fact, solution electrochemical data9b,14,15 indicate similar reduction potentials (ca.−1.0 to −1.1 V vs.FeCp2+/0) for 1 and PCBM. In order to address further the relative electron accepting properties of 1 and PCBM, we studied the photophysics of 1–PCBM blend films using transient absorption spectroscopy. These data indicated that photoexcitation of a blend of PCBM and 1 resulted in the formation of 1++–PCBM− (see ESI†, Fig. S1), consistent with PCBM exhibiting a larger EA than the PDI 1 in films.
On the basis of these results, higher charge photogeneration yields might be expected using PCBM rather than 1 as the acceptor. Typical transient absorption spectra, observed at 1 μs, for P3HT–1 and P3HT–PCBM blend films are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1). All such spectra exhibited spectral features characteristic of radical ion formation (e.g.: P3HT+ absorption maximum at ∼950 nm and 1−− absorption at 700 nm16). These transient absorption signals exhibited μs- to ms-timescale, dispersive, O2-independent decay dynamics (see Fig. 2 for typical data), confirming their assignment to long-lived, dissociated radical ions.
 Fig. 2  Typical transient absorption data for (a) P(T10T10TT0)–1 and (b) P(T10T10TT0)–PCBM 1 : 1 blend films in a N2 environment, monitored at 850 and 960 nm, respectively. Also shown for (a) is data collected under O2 (---) and a power law fit to the data (ΔOD ∝ t−α). 
Whilst all the μs- to ms-transients observed for polymer–1 and polymer–PCBM blend films exhibited decay dynamics and transient spectra consistent with their assignments to dissociated charges, the amplitudes of these transients, and, therefore, the yields of dissociated charges varied strongly between films. Typical data illustrating this are shown in Fig. 2 which compares the transient absorption decays observed for blend films employing the polythiophene P(T10T10TT0). For P(T10T10TT0)–PCBM blend films, the signal magnitude is ≤5 μΔOD. In contrast, P(T10T10TT0)–1 blend films exhibited a strong transient absorbance signal (∼0.25 mΔOD). This difference cannot be assigned to differences in exciton quenching, with the PL in fact being more strongly quenched for the P(T10T10TT0)– PCBM blend film. Rather, this increase in long-lived polarons is assigned to more efficient dissociation of initially generated polaron pairs, thereby avoiding geminate charge-recombination losses.
The magnitude of this long-lived TA signal was determined for all the blend films studied. Fig. 3 plots this signal magnitude, corresponding approximately to the yield of dissociated polarons, versus the relative free-energy difference for charge separation, −ΔGCSrel (defined as the difference between the singlet exciton energy ES and the free energy of the dissociated charges (IPdon− EAacc)). For the polythiophene–PCBM blend films, it is apparent that the yield of charge photogeneration shows a very strong dependence upon ΔGCSrel, with a 300 meV reduction in ΔGCSrel correlating with almost a two orders of magnitude decrease in long-lived polaron yield, in agreement with our previous observations of 19 : 1 blend films.4 (We note the polymers employed and blend composition are distinct from those employed in ref. 4; these data therefore provide further evidence for the generality of the strong ΔGCSrel dependence of charge generation observed for polymer–PCBM films in ref. 4.) In contrast, it is apparent that for the polythiophene–1 films, the yield of dissociated charges photogeneration is essentially independent of ΔGCSrel, at least for the polymer series studied here.
 Fig. 3  Plot of the relative yield of long-lived, dissociated polarons in polythiophene–1 (red squares) and polythiophene–PCBM (blue squares) blend films, as measured by the amplitude of the transient absorption at 850 and 1000 nm, respectively, at 1 μs, against estimated driving force for charge separation, −ΔGCSrel. 
We have previously proposed that the strong dependence of charge photogeneration yield upon −ΔGCSrel for polythiophene–PCBM blend films originates from the requirement of the initially generated polaron pairs to overcome their Coulombic attraction, with a large −ΔGCSrel providing the polaron pairs with enough thermal energy to overcome this electrostatic attraction.4 The data we report here clearly indicate that this requirement for excess thermal energy is less severe when PCBM is replaced by 1 as the electron acceptor. Since this is only a comparison of two electron acceptors, it is not possible to determine unambiguously the origin of this difference. One possibility is that it originates from a difference in domain sizes, with the polythiophene–1 films exhibiting larger domain sizes, potentially facilitating charge dissociation away from the donor/acceptor interface.17 Countering this argument, we note that our studies of charge photogeneration as a function of polymer crystallinity, blend composition and annealing4,18 indicate that the dependence of photogeneration yield upon domain size may not be sufficiently strong to account for the trends in the data reported herein. Alternatively, and of particular interest, this difference may originate from the higher electron mobility of 1 relative to PCBM (1.3 vs. 8 × 10−4 cm2V−1 s−1). We note the higher electron mobility, and the observed increase in polaron yield, may originate microscopically from increased intermolecular delocalisation arising within liquid-crystalline π-stacks of the PDI. Our previous studies have indicated that polymer hole mobility was not a key indicator of charge dissociation yield.4 However, charge separation in these blend films is primarily based upon LUMO to LUMO electron transfer, and as such the electron mobility of the acceptor material might be expected to have a more important influence on the efficiency of polaron pair dissociation. This possibility suggests that a potentially important, but hitherto little considered, strategy for the optimisation of the efficiency of polymer–small molecule solar cells due to improved charge separation might be to focus on the use of higher electron mobility acceptor materials in order to facilitate the efficiency of photogeneration in such blend films.
The transient absorption measurements described above are indicators of the yield rather than the rate of charge dissociation. This yield is dependent upon competition between the underlying processes of charge dissociation, geminate recombination and/or thermalisation. We have previously shown,4 and confirmed herein, that this competition can be influenced by ΔGCSrel. We have shown elsewhere that this yield is enhanced (for equivalent ΔGCSrel) by the use of a charge transfer polymer PCPDTBT (poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole]).5 The data we report herein suggest that this yield can be further influenced by the domain morphology/electron mobility of the acceptor molecules, and implies that, at least in terms of charge photogeneration, PDIs can be more effective electron acceptors than PCBM. As such, if blend morphology limitations upon charge transport can be addressed, PDIs will be promising acceptors for bulk heterojunction solar cells.
