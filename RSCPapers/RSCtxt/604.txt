    , Accepted 2nd October 2020First published on 8th October 2020AbstractComplex metal halides are widely explored for photovoltaic applications. However, rather poor intrinsic and environmental stability of the commonly used halide-based absorbers causes a demand for more stable photoactive materials. In this work, we report a novel family of tellurium complex polyhalides with the composition A2TeBr6I2. The crystal structure of these compounds contains [TeBr6]2− octahedra interconnected by I2 bridge-molecules via halogen bonding. They are narrow bandgap semiconductors (Eg below 1.5 eV) that show strong photoresponse. Moreover, they are easily synthesized in one step from the aqueous solution. These facts make them promising candidates for use in solar cells and photodetectors.
Introduction
A significant research effort is currently focused on the development of novel photoactive materials for solar light harvesting and various optoelectronic applications. Complex lead halides with perovskite structure recently made a tremendous impact in this field.1–3 The power conversion efficiency of solar cells based on these materials surpassed 25%,4 but the major drawback of such materials is their low operational stability.5,6 It has been repeatedly shown that poor stability towards light, heat and multiple other stress factors is an intrinsic property of halide perovskites.7,8 Therefore, exploring alternative lead-free light absorbers for photovoltaics is an important research task.
Among many chemical elements that can be employed in such materials, tellurium still remains poorly investigated. A few papers reported investigation of tellurium-based double perovskites with the composition A2TeHal6 (A = Cs+, methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), benzylammonium (BA), and guanidinium (HGu))9,10 as potential photoactive materials. However, Cs2TeI6 compounds appear to have poor charge transport properties mostly due to their 0D structure with isolated [TeX6]2− octahedra. Moreover, they are also intolerant to defects in contrast to lead- and tin-containing analogs.11 However, hybrid iodotellurates with organic cations seem to be more promising candidates for photovoltaic applications. They demonstrated high charge carrier mobility and low trap density coupled with quite narrow and easily tunable bandgap of around 1.5 eV. Moreover, these complexes are completely stable in air for more than two months.10 Surprisingly, there have been no reports on the application of these halides in photovoltaic devices presumably because they are not photoresponsive. Another complication might be related to the challenges associated with the solution processing of high-quality films of such compounds.10
In our previous works, we have reported the synthesis and characterization of hybrid tellurium polyhalides having the general formula A2{[TeBr6](Br2)} containing {Br2} moieties forming bridges between the TeBr6 octahedra by means of halogen bonding. In the A-sites they can contain a large variety of organic cations particularly those based on substituted pyridinium and tetraalkylammonium species. These complexes demonstrate rather high bandgap values close to 2 eV.12–15 However, much narrower bandgap is required for efficient light harvesting in solar cells.16–18 Decreasing Eg value can be accomplished by partial substitution of bromine with iodine.19,20 We explored this approach in this work and present here a novel family of complex tellurium polyhalides with the composition A2{[TeBr6](I2)}. These polyhalides show greater structural diversity than the polybromides with four types of anionic lattice including quasi 2D and 3D structures. These materials also demonstrated remarkably small optical bandgap values (below 1.5 eV) which forebode their use for efficient light-harvesting in solar cells. Furthermore, we revealed photoresponse in a series of the designed compounds and applied them as materials for photodetectors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of the photoresponse behavior among the tellurium complexes.
Generally, the synthesis of tellurium halide complexes is rather straightforward. The most frequently used synthetic approach is based on the reaction of a tellurium(IV) halide with the halide of the corresponding A cation. Both tellurium halide and AHal can be either prepared in advance or in situ generated by the treatment of some tellurium precursor (such as TeO2) with the appropriate HHal acid;10,12,21–23 it is also possible to use metal tellurides24 or diaryltellurides25 as precursors.
For the synthesis of A2TeBr6I2 compounds, we chose the first strategy explored also in our previous publications.12–15 Dissolution of TeO2 in aqueous HBr followed by addition of molecular iodine and corresponding organic bromide produce black precipitates of the target compounds (see synthetic details in ESI†). These reactions were performed with eight different ABr: seven substituted pyridinium derivatives R,R′-Py+ and tetramethylammonium (TMA). All synthesized compounds were characterized by Raman and FTIR-spectroscopy (Fig. S1, ESI†), as well as single crystal XRD. Table 1 summarizes the composition, structure type, thermal and optical properties of the investigated compounds.

In contrast to tellurium polybromides, the novel A2TeBr6I2 compounds represent a more diverse family from a structural standpoint. Four types of anionic sublattice were observed in their structures as shown in Fig. 1. Type I structure is comprised of [TeBr6]2− octahedra connected by I2 bridge-molecules into a 1D polymeric zigzag chain similar to the previously reported structure of tellurium polybromides.15 Compounds 1–4 all feature this structural pattern. Compound 7 has a similar, although somewhat distorted anionic structure with Te–Br–I angle being significantly smaller (134.8°) than in the case of 1–4 (166.2°). Another known structural motif is Type II quasi-linear 1D anionic framework found in compound 5. The Te–Br and Br⋯I distances are given in ESI (Table S2†); in all cases, the latter are significantly shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii for Br and I atoms (3.81 Å (ref. 26 and 27)), indicating the presence of non-covalent interactions which can be regarded as halogen bonding (XB).
 Fig. 1  Types of anionic lattices in A2TeBr6I2 tellurium polyhalides. I2 molecules in Type III and Type IV structures are disordered over two and three perpendicular dimensions with equal site occupancy (0.5 and 0.33, respectively). 
In the other two compounds (6 and 8), the {I2} units experience disordering; these cases can be considered as either independent structural types or derivatives of Type I or II. In compound 6, the {I2} units are disordered over six positions with non-equal occupancy (from 0.043 to 0.301), so that a quasi-2D-structure is formed (it can be regarded as Type III). In 8, diiodine units are disordered over three positions with equal occupancies. They connect [TeBr6]2− octahedra in all three dimensions, which results in the formation of a quasi-3D framework, which can be considered as superposition of Type II chains or, alternatively, as a novel Type IV (see Table S2† for geometric parameters).
Such quasi-3D structures are especially interesting for electronic applications since they can potentially enable isotropic properties of the materials, in particular, the charge transport essential for electronic and photovoltaic applications. The importance of the structural dimensionality was recently demonstrated for a series of complex Bi(III) halides and ASbBr6 compounds.28,29 Also, there is an evident similarity of packing to highly symmetric A2[TeI6] iodotellurates(IV).30
In all structures the bridging I–I bonds are slightly elongated as compared to isolated I2 molecules. Similarly, for bromine atoms bridged with I2 (denoted as BrI) the Te–BrI bond is slightly elongated compared to other Te–Br bonds in 1–7. However, compound 8 differs from others. Owing to vast Te–Br⋯I–I⋯Br–Te network that isotropically embraces all Br atoms in [TeBr6]2− octahedra, there are no free-standing Te–Br bonds of different lengths (Table S1, ESI†).
In an attempt to crystallize thin films of the synthesized tellurium polyhalides from acetonitrile solution containing an excess of I2 we observed a peculiar behavior in case of compound 8. The resulted black crystals visually similar to the pristine powder did not contain iodine at all according to elemental analysis. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that these crystals have a composition 1,2-DMePyTeBr5 (denoted as compound 9) and are composed of 1D polymeric molecules featuring [TeBr5]− fragments directly connected by the shared bromine atoms (Fig. 2). As far as we know, such structural type has never been reported before for halotellurates(IV).
 Fig. 2  Fragment of the anionic structure of the compound 9. 
Unlike the A2TeBr6Br2 polybromides, which start to decompose immediately after isolation from the mother liquor (for A = Py-derived cations), complexes 1–9 are stable in air for days. Thermal behavior of 1–9 was investigated using thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA). All compounds showed the mass loss at the first step of the decomposition matching well the elimination of the I2 molecule (Fig. S2, ESI†). The data presented in Table 1 show that 1–9 decompose at relatively high temperatures, which is highly beneficial for their application as materials in electronic devices. This is particularly true for compound 1 incorporating TMA cation, which demonstrated remarkably high decomposition temperature above 340 °C. It should be emphasized that such impressive stability is hardly reachable for conventional complex halides of lead, tin, bismuth and antimony. Such a high decomposition temperature for a tellurium polyhalide with I2 molecular bridges in the structure can be considered as an outstanding result opening broad opportunities for practical use of 1 in multiple optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.
Notably, all A2TeBr6I2 compounds appeared as black powders (see inset for compound 1 in Fig. 3) which implies that they absorb light in a wide spectral range. Indeed, UV-Vis absorption spectra of the powders recorded with the use of an integrating sphere confirmed that tellurium polyhalides A2TeBr6I2 are low bandgap materials (Fig. 3 and S3, ESI†). For instance, compound 1 absorbs light efficiently down to ∼840 nm and has an optical bandgap of 1.56 eV. Other compounds showed Eg values in the range of 1.4–1.5 eV as calculated using Tauc plot (Fig. 3b and S4†), which falls in the estimated optimum area for absorbers in single-junction solar cells.

This finding inspired us to explore in more detail electronic and photovoltaic properties of the synthesized materials. Compounds 1, 2, 3 and 8 were chosen for this investigation.
We were able to fabricate lateral two-terminal resistor devices with compounds 1, 2, 3 and 9, as illustrated in Fig. 4a. Gold electrodes were thermally evaporated on glass substrates to form a narrow FET-like channel. In between of these electrodes, a solution of the polyhalide complex in acetonitrile (containing an excess of I2 to prevent non-stoichiometry due to iodine evaporation) was dropcasted. To probe the photoresponse of chosen tellurium halides, the I–V curves of fabricated devices were measured in dark and under illumination with the blue laser (405 nm, ∼70 mW cm−2). Exemplary I–V curves obtained for compound 1 are shown in Fig. 4b. Increase in the current under illumination was fully reproducible thus evidencing photoresponsive behavior of this material. Moreover, we were able to operate the fabricated devices as photodetectors and register in a reliable way a series of light pulses (Fig. 4c). A similar photoresponse was observed for other tellurium complex polyhalides (Fig. S5, ESI†).

The major figures of merit of the fabricated photodetectors are listed in Table 2. The absolute values of photocurrent and all other device characteristics were relatively low due to the suboptimal film quality achieved so far for the investigated tellurium polyhalides. Still, the obtained results provide a solid evidence for photoactivity of the synthesized compounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of that kind reported for complex tellurium(IV) halides.

It should be emphasized that real practical applications of tellurium polyhalides, particularly in solar cells, are strongly dependent on the quality of their films. Therefore, further efforts need to be focused on the development of new processing techniques to enable the growth of high-quality films of these materials.
In conclusion, we designed and investigated a new family of tellurium complex polyhalides with the A2TeBr6I2 generic composition. Among the series of eight synthesized compounds we identified four types of anionic frameworks. Particularly exciting is the observation of previously unknown quasi-2D and quasi-3D structural motifs, which make such compounds exceptionally promising for electronic applications due to their high structural dimensionality and, hence, expected efficient charge transport. Furthermore, these compounds demonstrate impressive thermal stability with decomposition temperatures reaching 340 °C for structure 1 and very attractive optical properties, particularly narrow optical bandgaps of 1.3–1.5 eV. The photoresponse of the synthesized compounds is unique among all known tellurium(IV) complex halides and thus provides a clear indication of a high potential of such materials as light absorbers for photovoltaics.
