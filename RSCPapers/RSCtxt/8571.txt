The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the powders sintered at 1000 °C showed the purity and formation of monophasic compounds. The phase composition and purity confirmation of the samples were also characterized via FTIR spectroscopy. Desirable microstructural features and particle size of phosphorous materials of the polycrystalline samples were studied via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The local environments of Eu3+ and Nd3+ activator ions of the garnets structure compounds were investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The local environments of the small number of substituted phosphorous ions (Eu3+ and Nd3+) in YAG were shown to critically influence optical properties. Structural features of garnets were found to correlate with their luminescence properties. The luminescence properties were characterized using the results from a photoluminescence (PL) study. Effective concentration of luminescent ion – Nd in YAG was, observed and the optimum ratio between two phosphorous (Eu3+ and Nd3+) was analysed. The transition among europium and neodymium phosphorus was determined.
1. Introduction
Y3Al5O12 is commonly called yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) and adopts the cubic garnet structure.1 Rare-earth-doped YAG has been thoroughly investigated for application in various fields, such as lasers, scintillators, cathode ray tubes (CRT), field-emission displays (FEDs), plasma display panels (PDPs), and optical windows, due to its attractive optical properties, outstanding chemical stability, low creep rate and high thermal resistance.2–6 Luminescent materials based on YAG are stable under conditions of high irradiation with an electron beam.7,8
YAG crystal activated with neodymium ions (Nd3+) is a well-known laser crystal that is widely used in scientific research, medical operations, material processing, military and other industrial fields. Flash lamp is commonly used as a pumping source for the Nd3+:YAG laser. Although it has low electro-optical conversion efficiency, high peak power and high energy lamp light can be applied directly on the laser media.9,10
When YAG was doped with Nd3+, it was reported that the near-infrared (NIR) laser output with high power and high slope efficiency was obtained in single crystals and polycrystalline transparent ceramic.11–15 The Nd3+-doped YAG is one of the most popular laser active materials. Nd3+ in YAG has a unique metastable level placed in the region of 11500 cm−1 and is able to provide laser emission in the 0.9 μm, 1 μm and 1.3 μm wavelength ranges on transitions to the lower 4I9/2, 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 manifolds. This ion has a rich structure of closely spaced energy levels above the emitting level that extends to the UV, which can be used for pumping with broad-band optical sources, such as lamps or solar radiation or with resonant diode lasers. The performance of the Nd3+ lasers under a broad-band pumping is limited by the poor overlap with the sharp and discrete absorption lines of Nd3+ and by the large quantum defect between the average pump quantum and the emitted radiation quantum. Since the first high quality Nd:YAG ceramic was fabricated in 1995, these ceramics have attracted much attention due to their numerous advantages, such as easy preparation of large single crystals of Nd:YAG, short fabrication time, high doping concentration and multifunctional composite structure.16–22 A ceramic solid-state laser can be well matched with the transitional single crystal laser in output power and optical conversion efficiency. However, numerous approaches to Nd:YAG ceramics are focused on the 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 transitions at 1064 nm.23–25 In recent years there has been great interest in solid-state lasers operating at 266 nm, which quadruples the frequency of the 1064 nm line, and has found wide applications in the fields of criminal investigation and scientific research. For example, a 266 nm laser can be used as a cleaning tool for removing copper oxide from copper and paint from aircraft.26–28
Eu3+ doped inorganic matrices are successfully employed as orange to red emitting phosphors. These materials are characterized via a very high quantum efficiency, sufficient absorption strength and stability. Upon excitation of the Eu3+ ion, it emits due to the 5D0 → 7FJ transitions, in particular for a high doping level and/or hosts with rather high phonon frequencies, e.g. phosphates or borates. Emission lines originating from 5D1,2 → 7FJ transitions are only present if the concentration is low and the highest phonon frequency of the host is low to prevent multiphonon or cross-relaxation of the higher excited states. Generally, the most intense emission lines originate from the 5D0 → 7F1,2,4 transitions, which are located in the 580 to 720 nm range.29 The properties of Eu3+ doped solid state compounds have been under ongoing improvement for their applications since decades. In addition, recently, compounds doped with europium(III) have been explored for up-conversion and down-conversion of near UV and near IR radiation to improve the overall efficiency of Si solar cells.30–33 The possible effective energy transfer from one lanthanide ion to another in a different host matrix was investigated in numerous studies.34–36 The energy transfer between Ce3+ and Eu3+ was investigated as mentioned in ref. 37. However, in the study mentioned in ref. 38, it was shown that Eu3+ ions co-doping had a quenching effect for luminous Ce3+ ions in YAG. Moreover, the authors39 claimed that co-doped YAG:Ce,Eu showed separate luminescence of Ce3+ and Eu3+. The role of RE3+ co-doped into the CdSiO3:Mn2+ matrix and the possible long-lasting phosphorescence process was discussed in the study.40 The enhanced emission intensity of co-doped blue nanophosphor was explained via energy transfer from the Er3+/Nd3+ ions to the Eu2+ ions in BaMgAl10O17.41 An energy transfer mechanism from Ce3+ to Nd3+ and Sm3+ ions was also proposed.42 Much more different and sometimes contradictory results were recently published on this topic.43–45 All of these results demonstrate that this topic still is being actively investigated by several research groups.
In this study, YAG garnet samples doped with different amounts of Nd3+ were prepared using a sol–gel method. To the best of our knowledge, Nd:YAG garnets with various doping levels of europium have not been synthesized yet. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to fabricate these garnets and investigate their structural and luminescence properties.
2. Materials and methods
The lanthanide aluminium garnet samples were synthesized using an aqueous sol–gel method with optimized synthesis parameters.46,47 In the aqueous sol–gel process, the following materials were used: Y(NO3)3·6H2O (Alfa Aesar 99.9%), Nd(NO3)3·6H2O (Alfa Aesar 99.9%), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Eurochemicals 99.99%), Eu2O3 (Alfa Aesar 99.99%) and HOCH2CH2OH (Roth 99.5%). Y and Nd nitrates were dissolved in concentrated acetic acid (about 10 mL) with a small amount of water. Clear solutions were obtained after stirring at 60–65 °C in beakers covered with a watch glass. Then aluminium nitrate nanohydrate and an appropriate quantity of europium oxide dissolved in small amount of acetic acid were added to the abovementioned solution and diluted to 100 mL. The resulting mixtures were stirred at 65 °C for 1 h, followed by dropwise addition of ethane-1,2-diol (HOCH2CH2OH) with vigorous stirring. The resulting solution was mixed at the same temperature for another 1 h and then concentrated by slow solvent evaporation at 65 °C until the solution turned into transparent gels. The gels were dried in an oven at 100 °C temperature for 24 h. The resulting gel powders were ground in an agate mortar and heated in air at 800 °C for 4 h with slow temperature elevation (5 °C min−1). After grinding in an agate mortar, the powders were further sintered in air at 1000 °C for 10 h.
The phase purity and crystallinity of synthesized samples were characterized via X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis on a D8 Bruker AXS powder diffractometer using Cu Kα1 radiation. The diffraction patterns were recorded at the standard rate of 1.5 2θ min−1.
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was chosen as an additional tool to prove purity of garnets and the spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR Spectrum 1000 spectrometer.
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained using a Hitachi SU-70 scanning electron microscope.
The local structure of garnets was investigated via solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). 27Al MAS (Magic-Angle Spinning) NMR spectra were recorded on a 600 MHz (14.1 T) Varian NMR system equipped with a 1.6 mm NB Triple Resonance HXY Fast MAS probe. The Larmor frequency for 27Al was 156.25 MHz and the chemical shift axis was referenced to 1 M Al(NO3)3. The MAS frequency was 32 kHz. 27Al spectra were measured using a short excitation pulse with the duration of 1 μs. The number of scans was 800 and the relaxation delay was 1 s.
Luminescence properties were measured using Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 spectrometer equipped with double excitation and emission monochromators, 450 W Xe arc lamp, mirror optics for powder samples and a liquid nitrogen cooled (−80 °C) NIR detector (Hamamatsu R5509 – 42).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 XRD analysis
The phase purity and compositional changes of the YAG doped with neodymium and co-doped with europium ions were controlled via X-ray diffraction analysis. The XRD patterns of corresponding Y3−xNdxAl5O12, Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu and Y3−xNdxAl5O12:0.5% Eu powders annealed at 1000 °C are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), Fig. 1 and Fig. S2 (ESI†), respectively.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu samples annealed at 1000 °C for 10 h. Vertical lines represent the standard XRD pattern of YAG. 
The XRD results, presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†), reveal that neodymium doped garnet samples obtained at 1000 °C consisted of one YAG crystalline phase in the entire investigated substitutional range. The obtained XRD patterns were in a good agreement with the reference data for Y3Al5O12. The XRD patterns showed that these garnets were the only phase detected in the end products. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S2 (ESI†) also confirm the formation of a cubic structure in the Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu and Y3−xNdxAl5O12:0.5% Eu garnets, respectively. All the XRD patterns matched with reference data and did not show any influence of dopants on the formation of garnet crystalline structure. Thus, the utilized 1000 °C temperature for the fabrication of Eu3+ and Nd3+ doped YAG was sufficient to obtain single-phase garnets.
It is known that Y3+ ions occupy eight-coordinated dodecahedral sites in the YAG lattice. The Nd3+ and Eu3+ ions, incorporated in the lattice, both substitute for the Y3+ ions. The small increase in the lattice parameter for the Eu3+ doped samples compared to the undoped one has been attributed to the larger ionic radius of Eu3+ (1.095 Å) compared to Y3+ ions (1.053 Å). Moreover, a small decrease should appear in the garnet lattice doped with Nd3+ ion (0.980 Å).38,48,49 On the other hand, the lattice parameters of co-doped with both ions (Nd3+ and Eu3+) garnet could not be very different in comparison with undoped sample since the average of ionic radius is compensated by larger and smaller ionic radii of these lanthanides. Compared with reference data, our synthesized garnets showed almost the same lattice parameters as those of standard Y3Al5O12 [PDF 88-2048].
3.2 FTIR spectroscopy
FTIR spectroscopy was used as an additional tool for the structural characterization of the obtained garnet materials. The FTIR spectra of the Y-Al-O:Nd,Eu precursor gels annealed at 1000 °C for 10 h are shown in Fig. 2. The FTIR spectra of Y3−xNdxAl5O12 and Y3−xNdxAl5O12:0.5% Eu samples are also shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), respectively.
 Fig. 2  FTIR spectra of the Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu samples annealed at 1000 °C for 10 h. 
All of the FTIR spectra were almost identical and demonstrated a high reproducibility for the sol–gel processing used for the fabrication of lanthanide-substituted garnets in this study. The observed M–O (RE–O and Al–O) vibrations, which, in view of the earlier reports, are characteristic stretching frequencies in the garnet structure, let us conclude that the FTIR results were consistent with the crystallization process observed using the XRD measurements. Consequently, the FTIR results absolutely support the results of XRD measurement and prove that there is no organic matter or combustion sub-products left in the end products obtained using the sol–gel processing route.50–57
3.3 SEM measurements
The textural properties of the Y3−xNdxAl5O12, Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu and Y3−xNdxAl5O12:Eu powders were investigated via SEM. These measurements gave information of the grain size and typical morphologies. SEM micrographs of the mentioned garnet samples calcined at 1000 °C are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), Fig. 3 and Fig. S6 (ESI†), respectively.
 Fig. 3  SEM micrographs of Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu garnets (Eu: a – 0.1%; b – 0.25%; c – 0.5%; d – 0.75%; e – 1%). 
The SEM micrograph presented in Fig. 3 shows the formation of very homogeneous mixed-metal Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu garnets and the formation of a continuous network of crystallites, which is a characteristic feature for the obtained ceramic materials. Individual particles appear to be nano-sized spherical shape particles and they partially fuse to form hard agglomerates. The microstructures of Y3−xNdxAl5O12 and Y3−xNdxAl5O12:Eu samples are very similar, indicating that particle size and shape are not influenced by lanthanides and their concentration. Apparently, the particles of all sol–gel derived garnet samples were formed with pronounced agglomeration, indicating good connectivity between the grains, which is characteristic feature for ceramic composite materials.47 It is particularly well known that phosphors with small (≤2 μm) spherically shaped particles are of great importance because of their high packing density, lower scattering of light, brighter luminescent performance, high definition and more improved screen packing density.58,59
3.4 NMR spectroscopy
Photoluminescent properties of YAG:Nd,Eu materials are largely determined by the local environments of Eu3+ and Nd3+ ions. In non-doped Y3Al5O12, yttrium cations reside in the dodecahedral interstices formed by the network of corner-sharing AlO4 and AlO6 polyhedra.5,60,61 Since it is expected that Eu3+ and Nd3+ ions will occupy the same dodecahedral interstices, the local environment of these cations could be evaluated via solid-state NMR spectroscopy, which uses the NMR-active 27Al nuclei as local probes. Indeed, the resonance frequency of 27Al nuclei that are close to the Nd3+ substituent ions was shifted to lower values compared to the resonance frequency of 27Al nuclei that have only Y3+ ions nearby (Fig. 4). This is a result of a through-bond hyperfine interaction and through-space anisotropic dipolar interaction between the unpaired Nd3+ 4f electronic spins and the 27Al nuclear spins.62
 Fig. 4  (a) 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the Y3−xNdxAl5O12:0.5% Eu samples. The signals at 43 ppm and −63 ppm belong to AlIV(1Nd) and AlVI(1Nd) environments, i.e. to four- and six-coordinated Al sites with one Nd3+ cation in their vicinity. At high neodymium concentrations, additional peaks at −127 ppm and −192 ppm appeared; they are assigned to AlVI(2Nd) and AlVI(3Nd) environments, respectively. Asterisks denote spinning sidebands. (b) Intensities of different aluminum signals as a function of concentration of Nd in the samples. Solid lines represent calculated intensities for the random spatial distribution of Nd3+ ions along the crystal lattice. The discrepancy between the AlVI data points and the corresponding calculated line is a consequence of overlapping AlVI, AlIV(2Nd) and AlIV(3Nd) signals; the calculated sum of all three contributions is presented with a dashed line and agrees well with the experimental data. 
A closer look at 27Al MAS NMR spectra shows that at low concentrations of Nd3+ in the samples, two major 27Al signals at 68 ppm and 0 ppm could be observed (Fig. 4a, Fig. S7–S9, ESI†); the observed signals correspond to four- and six-coordinated aluminium atoms, respectively. The four-coordinated AlIV atoms are surrounded by two yttrium ions at a distance of about 3.0 Å, and by additional four yttrium ions at about 3.7 Å. This gives rise to a relatively large electric field gradient at the position of AlIV nuclei and thus to a rather broad peak. The six-coordinated AlVI atoms reside in a much more symmetrical environment. They are surrounded by six equidistant yttrium ions at a distance of 3.35 Å, which leads to a small value for the electric field gradient. As a result, the AlVI peak is narrow and well resolved. In addition to the two strong peaks, two weaker peaks resonating at 43 ppm and −63 ppm could be observed in the 27Al MAS NMR spectra. The latter two peaks can be assigned respectively to AlIV and AlVI atoms with one neodymium cation in their first cation coordination shells (AlIV(1Nd) and AlVI(1Nd)). These peaks already confirm the proximity of Al and Nd within the YAG:Nd,Eu materials.
At high Nd3+ concentration (e.g. x = 0.8), additional peaks appear at −127 ppm and −192 ppm. The paramagnetic shifts are additive with the number of proximal Nd3+ ions, and therefore these peaks can be attributed to the AlVI nuclei that have two and three Nd3+ ions in their first cation coordination shell, respectively;their intensities increased with increasing amount of neodymium. AlIV nuclei with two and three neodymium ions nearby are expected to resonate at 18 ppm and −7 ppm, respectively; this is very close to the strong peak of AlVI atoms surrounded only by yttrium ions, which is why the two weak peaks could not be resolved.
A simple calculation of the expected aluminium intensities based on the probabilities for a normal distribution shows a very good agreement with the experimentally detected intensities, and thus reveals that the Nd3+ ions were randomly dispersed throughout the crystal lattice of YAG:Nd,Eu (Fig. 4b). 27Al MAS NMR also undoubtedly confirmed the successful incorporation of europium ions into the crystalline lattice of YAG:Nd,Eu. As Eu3+ ion has six unpaired 4f electrons, a large paramagnetic shift is expected for the closest 27Al nuclei. Indeed, the resonance frequency of AlVI with one europium cation in the neighbourhood is shifted to substantially higher values, i.e. to 113 ppm. We analysed the 27Al peak intensities of Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu samples, in which the content of europium varied (Fig. 5). The linear relation between the Al(1Eu) line intensity and Eu3+ indicates that, as for neodymium, the spatial distribution of europium ions in these samples is also homogeneous.

3.5 Photoluminescence
In order to study the doping effect on the luminescence behaviour of the synthesized samples, photoluminescence studies were also carried out. Emission spectra were measured at room temperature under 588 nm excitation for neodymium and under 394 nm excitation for europium. Excitation spectra were studied via monitoring emission at 1064 nm for neodymium and at 591 nm for europium. Excitation and emission spectra of Y3Al5O12:Nd garnets are shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  Excitation (a) and emission (b) spectra of Y3−xNdxAl5O12 samples. 
The excitation spectra consisted of 10 sets of lines at around 380, 430, 470, 520, 580, 630, 680, 750, 810, and 880 nm; these lines originated from intraconfigurational transitions of Nd3+ ions from ground state 4I9/2 to the excited states, namely, (4D3/2 + 4D5/2 + 2I11/2 + 2L15/2 + 4D7/2 + 2I13/2), (2P1/2 + 2D5/2), (2G9/2 + 2D3/2 + 4G11/2 + 2K15/2), (4G7/2 + 4G9/2 + 2K13/2), (2G5/2 + 2G7/2), (2H11/2), (4F9/2), (4F7/2 + 4S3/2), (4F5/2 + 2H9/2), and (4F3/2), respectively. The NIR emission spectra is comprised of several peaks located at 850–950 nm and 1050–1125 nm, which arise due to the 4F3/2 → 4I9/2 and 4F3/2 → 4I11/2 transitions of Nd3+. Peaks near 1340 nm are attributed to the 4F3/2 → 4I13/2 transitions of Nd3+.14,63,64 As seen, the 0.1 mol Nd-doped sample shows the most intensive luminescence. It is clearly seen that intensity of all peaks increases proportionally with decreasing the doping level of neodymium.
Similar results are also observed for the Y3−xNdxAl5O12:0.5% Eu samples (see Fig. 7). However, one can also observe a new set of lines in the excitation spectra at around 395 nm. These lines are attributed to the 7F0 → 5L6 transition of Eu3+ ions. This transition was not observed in samples without europium. All this leads to a conclusion that Eu3+ → Nd3+ energy transfer occurs in samples doped with both ions.
 Fig. 7  Excitation (a) and emission (b) spectra of Y3−xNdxAl5O12:0.5% Eu samples. 

Fig. 8 shows excitation and emission spectra of Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu. Fig. 8 demonstrates that the phosphor can be effectively excited using 394 nm UV radiation. Excitation was recorded with emission at 591 nm. The emission peaks found between 550 and 800 nm are in a good agreement with the reported values of Eu3+ emission transitions.64–66 The emission spectral lines of Eu3+ ion are sharp, which is due to the screening of 4f orbital by 5s and 5p orbitals from the crystal field of the host lattice. The spectra show the characteristic emission of Eu3+ arising due to 5D0→ 7F1 (591 nm), 5D0→ 7F2 (611 nm) and 5D0 → 7F4 (708 nm) transitions.67 As expected for the Eu3+ ions, a typical strong red emission was present with the line at 611 nm originating from the 5D0 → 7F2 transition. This band is attributed to the forced electric-dipole transition allowed only at low symmetries with no inversion center. It is also a hypersensitive transition and found to be very sensitive to the local structure surrounding the Eu3+ ions.68,69

Asymmetry ratio, defined as (5D0→ 7F2)/(5D0→ 7F1) provides a measure of the degree of distortion of the inversion symmetry of the local Eu3+ ions in the lattice. If the asymmetry ratio value is low, Eu3+ tends to localize at a high symmetry site or centrosymmetric site. In contrast, when the ratio symmetry value is high, Eu3+ tends to localize at a low symmetry site or non-centrosymmetric site.69–71 The most intensive Eu3+ emission was with 1% europium and it decreased with decreasing the doping level of europium. The intensity of luminescence increased much faster when the samples were doped with more than 0.5% europium (see Fig. 8). Fig. 9 represents the luminescence of Y3−xNdxAl5O12:0.5% Eu samples having a constant amount of Eu (0.5%) and different amounts of neodymium. Emission spectra were recorded with excitation at 394 nm and excitation spectra with emission at 591 nm. Neodymium ion is strongly affected by luminescent ion distribution, and as a result, with increasing the amount of Nd3+, the luminescence intensity decreased, despite having the same amount of europium.

It is well known that energy transfer (ET) process between luminescent ions can only occur if the energy differences between the ground and excited states of sensitizer and activator are equal (resonance condition) and if a suitable interaction between both systems exists. According to Dieke's diagram, this resonance condition is satisfied for the 5D0 → 7F1 (Eu3+) and 4I9/2 → (2G7/2 + 4G5/2) (Nd3+) transitions (Fig. 10). The PL spectrum (Fig. 6 and 7) consists of three main photoluminescence bands centered at 875, 1052 and 1324 nm, which are assigned to the 4F3/2→ 4I9/2, 4I11/2 and 4I13/2 transitions of Nd3+, respectively. Although no distinct difference in the peak position was observed. The enhanced fluorescence intensity in the ceramic was due to the incorporated Nd3+ into the crystalline phase with lower phonon energy.

Moreover, it was observed that the intensity of Nd3+ emission decreased when the Eu3+ concentration was increased (Fig. 8). The Eu3+ fluorescence decreased with the increasing Nd3+ content due to the energy transfer between these ions. The decrease was higher for the peak at 591 nm compared to the one at 611 nm due to the overlap with the strong Nd3+ absorption band centered at this wavelength. Energy transfer between ions could occur between the levels Eu3+: 5D0 and Nd3+: 2G7/2, 4G5/2 or between Eu3+: 5D0 and Nd3+: 4F5/2, 2H9/2 (see Fig. 6). The variation of luminescence intensity of the transition centred at 1061 nm (4F3/2 → 4I11/2) with Eu3+ ion concentration is depicted in Fig. 7. The decrease of this band with the Eu3+ ion concentration may be attributed to the cross relaxation process (4F3/2 + 7F0) → (4I15/2+ 7F6) from Nd3+ to Eu3+ ions (Fig. 10), as already observed.19,72–74
4. Conclusion
The sinterability and microstructural evolution of lanthanide-doped yttrium aluminium garnets, synthesized using an aqueous sol–gel process, were investigated in the present study. The aqueous sol–gel process was used to prepare neodymium-doped and neodymium and europium co-doped Y3−xNdxAl5O12:Eu garnets. It was confirmed from the XRD data that monophasic mixed-metal garnet samples can be easily synthesized at 1000 °C using the proposed sol–gel chemistry approach. The results obtained via FTIR spectroscopy were in a good agreement with XRD data. The samples surface microstructure was investigated via SEM. The Y3−xNdxAl5O12, Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu and Y3−xNdxAl5O12:Eu solids were composed of nano-sized spherical agglomerated particles. 27Al NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate structural features of the substituted garnets comparing the dependence of peaks intensity on the concentration of the dopant. It was demonstrated that with increasing amount of neodymium, less intensive and broader peaks were observed. The intensity of peaks attributable to Al–Eu increased proportionally with increasing the doping level of europium. Moreover, the effective concentration quenching of luminescence was observed in the neodymium-doped YAG samples. The luminescence spectra showed the highest luminescence for the samples with the lowest amount of Nd3+ dopant. Furthermore, when two different dopants were inserted into the Y3Al5O12 structure, neodymium behaviour remained the same; however, europium doping provided different results. With a constant amount of neodymium in Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu garnet, the highest luminescence appeared in the sample with 1% of europium when the characteristic excitation for europium was used. When excitation energy characteristic for neodymium was used, however, the most intensive luminescence was observed for the specimen with the smallest amount of europium. In general, it prepared an efficient photoluminescent material with homogeneously distributed Nd3+ and Eu3+ within the crystalline lattice.

 	Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu samples annealed at 1000 °C for 10 h. Vertical lines represent the standard XRD pattern of YAG.	 

 	Fig. 2  FTIR spectra of the Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu samples annealed at 1000 °C for 10 h.	 

 	Fig. 3  SEM micrographs of Y2.9Nd0.1Al5O12:Eu garnets (Eu: a – 0.1%; b – 0.25%; c – 0.5%; d – 0.75%; e – 1%).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the Y3−xNdxAl5O12:0.5% Eu samples. The signals at 43 ppm and −63 ppm belong to AlIV(1Nd) and AlVI(1Nd) environments, i.e. to four- and six-coordinated Al sites with one Nd3+ cation in their vicinity. At high neodymium concentrations, additional peaks at −127 ppm and −192 ppm appeared; they are assigned to AlVI(2Nd) and AlVI(3Nd) environments, respectively. Asterisks denote spinning sidebands. (b) Intensities of different aluminum signals as a function of concentration of Nd in the samples. Solid lines represent calculated intensities for the random spatial distribution of Nd3+ ions along the crystal lattice. The discrepancy between the AlVI data points and the corresponding calculated line is a consequence of overlapping AlVI, AlIV(2Nd) and AlIV(3Nd) signals; the calculated sum of all three contributions is presented with a dashed line and agrees well with the experimental data.
