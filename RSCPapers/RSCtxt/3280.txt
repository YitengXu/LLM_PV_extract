    , Accepted 11th July 2011First published on 8th August 2011AbstractGraphene-modified TiO2 nanosheets with exposed (001) facets (graphene/TiO2) were prepared by microwave-hydrothermal treatment of graphene oxide (GO) and hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanosheets with exposed (001) facets in an ethanol–water solvent. These nanocomposite samples showed high photocatalytic H2-production activity in aqueous solutions containing methanol, as sacrificial reagent, even without Pt co-catalyst. The optimal graphene content was found to be ∼1.0 wt%, giving a H2-production rate of 736 μmol h−1 g−1 with a quantum efficiency (QE) of 3.1%, which exceeded the rate observed on pure TiO2 nanosheets by more than 41 times. This high photocatalytic H2-production activity is due to the deposition of TiO2 nanosheets on graphene sheets, which act as an electron acceptor to efficiently separate the photogenerated charge carriers. The observed enhancement in the photocatalytic activity is due to the lower absolute potential of graphene/graphene˙− (−0.08 V vs. SHE, pH = 0) in comparison to the conduction band (−0.24 V) of anatase TiO2, meanwhile the aforementioned absolute value is higher than the reduction potential of H+ (0 V), which favors the electron transfer from the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 to graphene sheets and the reduction of H+, thus enhancing photocatalytic H2-production activity. The proposed mechanism for the observed photocatalytic performance of TiO2 nanosheets, modified with a small amount of graphene, was further confirmed by photoluminescence spectroscopy and transient photocurrent response. This work not only shows a possibility for the utilization of low cost graphene sheets as a substitute for noble metals (such as Pt) in the photocatalytic H2-production but also for the first time shows a significant enhancement in the H2-production activity by using metal-free carbon material as an effective co-catalyst.
1. Introduction
Graphene, a two-dimensional sp2 carbon network, has attracted a lot of attention due to its outstanding mechanical, thermal, optical, and electrical properties, since its discovery in 2004.1,2 Especially, it possesses a high thermal conductivity (∼5000 W m−1 K−1), ensures an excellent mobility of charge carriers (200 000 cm2 V−1 s−1), and exhibits an extremely high theoretical specific surface area (∼2600 m2 g−1).3 Moreover, functional graphene can be prepared through low-cost solution-based processes, which offer tremendous opportunities for functionalized graphene-based composite materials.4 Recently, it has been shown that decorating semiconductor materials with functional graphene can enhance their electronic,5 optoelectronic,6 electrocatalytic,7 and photocatalytic properties.8–17
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is an important wide-band gap semiconductor and has been extensively investigated as an excellent photocatalyst, owing to its exceptional properties such as nontoxicity, low cost, and long-term stability against photo and chemical corrosion.18–20 Both theoretical and experimental studies21 have shown that the photocatalytic activity of two-dimensional anatase TiO2 nanosheets is greatly enhanced by the presence of (001) high energy facets. Titania has been widely studied in the field of pollutant degradation and solar energy conversion including hydrogen production and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC).21–26 Because hydrogen has been considered to be a storable, clean, and environmental-friendly fuel of the future, photocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen has been considered as a significant and attractive solution to solve the global energy and environmental problems.27 However, the hydrogen production efficiency via photocatalytic water splitting on a bare TiO2 remains quite limited, mainly due to the rapid recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs within TiO2 particles. To resolve this problem, many methods have been proposed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, such as noble metal loading,28,29 metal ion doping,30 carbon and nitrogen doping,24,31,32 dye sensitization,26,33 and also addition of sacrificial reagents (electron donors or hole scavengers).34–36 Both the deposition of noble metals and the addition of sacrificial reagents have been intensively investigated for photocatalytic H2 production and have been proven to be very effective methods. It is well-known that the deposition of Pt on the TiO2 surface significantly increases the H2-production efficiency when photocatalytic water splitting is carried out in the presence of sacrificial reagents.27 However, Pt is both expensive and rare. Therefore, numerous efforts have been undertaken to replace Pt with low-cost additives for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts.22,23,25
Owing to the high specific surface area and superior electron mobility of graphene, it is considered to be a high performance support for photocatalysts and an efficient co-catalyst for hydrogen production. Kamat and co-workers37 demonstrated the feasibility of using graphene as an electron-transfer medium in the graphene/TiO2 composite photocatalyst. Zhang et al.38 reported graphene–P25 TiO2 composites synthesized under hydrothermal conditions and showed their enhanced photocatalytic activity for degradation of methylene blue in aqueous solutions. Liu et al.39 reported self-assembling TiO2 nanorods on large graphene oxide sheets at the water/toluene interface, exhibiting an improved photocatalytic performance by the effective charge anti-recombination on graphene oxide. However, the aforementioned studies mainly focus on the photocatalytic behavior of graphene–TiO2 composites for pollutant degradation. To our knowledge, there are only a few reports on graphene sheets as co-catalyst for photocatalytic H2-production. Here we report the microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis of graphene/TiO2 nanosheets composite photocatalysts. The modern microwave systems possess the capabilities of time and temperature programming, allowing fast and easy optimization of experimental conditions. This is highly beneficial for the elaboration of numerous recipes allowing preparation of various high-quality nanomaterials. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first report on the microwave-assisted synthesis of graphene/TiO2 nanosheet composites possessing a high percentage of (001) high energy facets and showing an enhanced photocatalytic H2-production activity.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of anatase TiO2 nanosheets
Anatase TiO2 nanosheets with exposed (001) facets were prepared by the reported hydrothermal method.40,41 In a typical synthesis, 25 mL of Ti(OC4H9)4 and 3 mL of hydrofluoric acid solution (with a concentration 40 wt%) were mixed in a dried Teflon-lined autoclave with a capacity of 100 mL at room temperature, and then kept at 180 °C for 24 h. After hydrothermal reaction, the white precipitates were collected, washed with ethanol and distilled water for three times, and then the products were dispersed in 100 mL of 1.0 M NaOH aqueous solution under vigorous shaking for 10–30 min in an ultrasonic cleaner. Next, the sample was collected by centrifugation, washed 3–4 times with distilled water to reach pH = 7, and then dried in an oven at 80 °C for 6 h.
2.2. Preparation of graphene/TiO2 composite photocatalysts
Graphene/TiO2 nanosheet composites were prepared by a simple microwave-hydrothermal method using ethanol–water as solvent. Graphene oxide (GO) sheets were provided by Xiamen Knano Graphene Technology Corporation Limited, Xiamen, P.R. China. In a typical synthesis, 2 mg of GO was dissolved in a mixed solution of distilled H2O (20 mL) and ethanol (10 mL) by ultrasonic treatment for 1 h, and then 0.2 g of the prepared TiO2 nanosheets was added to the obtained GO solution and stirred for another 1 h to get a homogeneous suspension. The suspension was then placed in a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, which was placed in a microwave-hydrothermal synthesis system (MDS-6, Sineo, Shanghai, China) and maintained at 180 °C for 1 h to simultaneously achieve the reduction of GO and the deposition of TiO2 nanosheets on the carbon substrate. After hydrothermal reaction, the resulting composite was collected, washed with distilled water followed by a rinsing in ethanol, and then dried in an oven at 80 °C for 6 h. To investigate the effect of graphene content on the photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of graphene/TiO2 composites, the weight percentages of graphene to TiO2 were varied from 0 to 5 (0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 wt%) (see Table 1) by varying the weight of GO; the resulting samples were labeled as Gx, where x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0, respectively. For comparison, graphene/P25 TiO2 nanoparticle composites (with the content of graphene, 1 wt%) were also prepared by reducing GO via the microwave-hydrothermal route under the same condition but replacing TiO2 nanosheets with Degussa P25 TiO2 nanoparticles.

2.3. Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using a S-4800 microscope (Hitachi, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were conducted with a JEM-2100F electron microscope (JEOL, Japan), using a 200 kV accelerating voltage. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a D/Max-RB X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) at a scan rate (2θ) of 0.05° s−1. The accelerating voltage and the applied current were 40 kV and 80 mA, respectively. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface areas (SBET) and the porosity of the samples were evaluated on the basis of nitrogen adsorption isotherms measured at −196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 gas adsorption apparatus (USA). All the samples were degassed at 180 °C before nitrogen adsorption measurements. The BET surface area was determined using adsorption data in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.05–0.3. The desorption data were used to determine the pore size distribution via the Barret–Joyner–Halender (BJH) method.42 The nitrogen adsorption volume at the relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.99 was used to determine the single-point pore volume and the average pore size. Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature using a micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw InVia) in the backscattering geometry with a 514.5 nm Ar+ laser as an excitation source. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed by using an ultrahigh vacuum VG ESCALAB 210 electron spectrometer equipped with a multichannel detector. The spectra were excited using Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) radiation (operated at 200 W) of a twin anode in the constant analyzer energy mode with a pass energy of 30 eV. UV-visible absorbance spectra were obtained for the dry-pressed disk samples with a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu, Japan). BaSO4 was used as a reflectance standard in a UV-visible diffuse reflectance experiment. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at room temperature on a Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi, Japan). The excitation wavelength was 315 nm, the scanning speed was 1200 nm min−1, and the PMT voltage was 700 V. The widths of excitation slit and emission slit were both 5.0 nm.
2.4. Photocatalytic H2-production activity
The photocatalytic H2-production experiments were performed in a 100 mL Pyrex flask at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, and the three openings of the flask were sealed with silicone rubber septum. A 350 W Xe arc lamp was used as light source (20 cm far away from the photocatalytic reactor). The focused intensity on the flask was ca. 20 mW cm−2. In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 50 mg of graphene/TiO2 composite photocatalyst was suspended in 80 mL of aqueous solution containing 25% methanol scavenger in volume. Prior to irradiation, the suspension of the catalyst was dispersed in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min, and then bubbled with nitrogen through the reactor for 40 min, to completely remove the dissolved oxygen and ensured that the reactor was in an anaerobic condition. A continuous magnetic stirrer was applied at the bottom of the reactor in order to keep the photocatalyst particles in suspension status during the whole experiment. 0.4 mL of gas was sampled intermittently through the septum after 60 min irradiation, and hydrogen was analyzed by gas chromatograph (GC-14C, Shimadzu, Japan, TCD, with nitrogen as a carrier gas and 5 Å molecular sieve column). All glassware was carefully rinsed with deionized water prior to use. The apparent quantum efficiency (QE) was measured under the same photocatalytic reaction conditions. Four low power UV-LEDs (3 W, 365 nm) (Shenzhen LAMPLIC Science Co. Ltd. China), which were positioned 1 cm away from the reactor in four different directions, were used as light sources to trigger the photocatalytic reaction. The focused intensity and areas on the flask for each UV-LED was ca. 80.0 mW cm−2 and 1 cm2, respectively. The QE was measured and calculated according to eqn (1): (1)
2.5. Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photocurrents were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (CHI660C Instruments) in a standard three-electrode system with the as-prepared samples as the working electrodes with an active area of ca. 0.5 cm2, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (saturating KCl) as a reference electrode. A 300 W Xe arc lamp was utilized as the UV-light source. The integrated light intensity was measured to be 25 mW cm−2 using a UV radiometer (UV-A). 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. For working electrodes, 0.25 g of photocatalyst (samples G0 and G1.0) was ground with 0.06 g polyethylene glycol (PEG, molecular weight 20000) and 1.0 mL water to make a slurry. Afterward, the slurry was coated onto a 2 cm × 1.2 cm F-doped SnO2-coated glass (FTO glass) electrode by the doctor blade method. Upon drying in an oven, the electrodes were calcined at 450 °C for 30 min. All electrodes used had a similar thickness (12–15 μm).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of graphene/TiO2 composites
A series of graphene/TiO2 composite samples denoted as Gx, where x stands for wt% of graphene to TiO2, was synthesized by microwave-hydrothermal treatment of GO and the hydrothermally prepared TiO2 nanosheets in an ethanol–water solution. During the microwave-hydrothermal reaction process, GO was reduced to graphene, simultaneously with the dispersion of TiO2 nanosheets on the graphene sheets.
Raman spectroscopy is a powerful nondestructive tool to characterize the crystalline quality of carbon. The significant structural changes occurring during the hydrothermal reaction process from GO to graphene are also reflected in their Raman spectra. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the Raman spectra of GO, pure TiO2 (sample G0) and graphene/TiO2 composite (sample G1.0). In the case of pure TiO2 (Fig. 1a), several characteristic bands at 146, 397, 516 and 637 cm−1 correspond to the Eg(1), B1g(1), A1g + B1g(2) and Eg(2) modes of anatase, respectively.43 As for GO, there are two typical Raman bands (Fig. 1c). The band at around 1354 cm−1 is common for disordered sp2 carbon and has been called the D-band.44,45 The other band at around 1594 cm−1 is close to that observed for well ordered graphite and is often called the G-band or E2g mode.44,45 For the graphene/TiO2 composite, all the Raman bands for anatase can be found. Significantly, the two characteristic peaks at about 1342 cm−1 (D band) and 1585 cm−1 (G band) for the graphitized structures are observed in the Raman spectroscopy of graphene/TiO2 composite.45 Also, in comparison to the bands of GO, the D band moves to 1342 cm−1 and the G band shifts to 1585 cm−1, which matches the value of pristine graphite (1586 cm−1), indicating the reduction of GO. A further observation indicates that the graphene/TiO2 composite shows an increased D/G intensity ratio in comparison to that of pure GO. This change suggests a decrease in the average size of the in-plane sp2 domains upon reduction of the exfoliated GO, confirming the existence of graphene sheets in the graphene/TiO2 composite.44,45

The successful functionalization of graphene sheets and TiO2 nanosheets was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 2a and b show the high-resolution C1s XPS spectra of GO and graphene/TiO2 composite (sample G1.0), respectively. Two typical peaks of GO are located at 285.0 and 287.0 eV, which are usually assigned to adventitious carbon and sp2-hybridized carbon from the GO, and the oxygen-containing carbonaceous bands (C–OH), respectively.15,44 The presence of oxygen-containing carbon in GO could provide active sites for directed connection with the surface of TiO2 nanosheets. For the graphene/TiO2 composite, the asymmetrical and broad features of the observed C1s XPS peaks suggest the co-existence of distinguishable models. A signal deconvolution with Gaussian curve fitting points out chemically different C species in the TiO2 matrix, with their C 1s binding energies at about 284.8, 285.8 and 288.9 eV. The main C1s peak located at 284.8 eV is assigned to elemental carbon. The sharp peak located at 285.8 eV is attributed to defect-containing sp2-hybridized carbons.15 In addition, there is a relatively weak peak located at 288.9 eV, contributed by carboxyl carbon (OC–O).15 Such a surface functional group indicated that the –OH groups on the TiO2 nanosheets possibly react with the –COOH groups on the GO surface through esterification to form OC–O–Ti bonds. Also, it should be noted that the peak at 287.0 eV for C–OH group on GO decreases remarkably or disappears in the C1s XPS spectroscopy of graphene/TiO2 composite. This indicates that the introduced GO has been efficiently reduced into graphene during the hydrothermal reaction process.

For the purpose of comparison Fig. 3 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the G1.0 graphene/TiO2 composite sample along with the bare GO. As can be seen from this figure, the reduced graphene was retained in the form of two-dimensional sheets with micrometre-long wrinkles after the hydrothermal treatment of GO. In the case of G1.0 graphene/TiO2 composites, due to the interaction between the hydrophilic functional groups (e.g., –OH, –COOH) on GO and the hydroxyl groups on TiO2, the TiO2 nanosheets with an average side size of ca. 50–80 nm and a thickness of ca. 6–8 nm were well dispersed on the graphene sheets with face-to-face orientation. This intimate interaction enables the electron to more easily transfer from TiO2 nanosheets to graphene sheets during the photoexcitation process. The corresponding high-magnification TEM image (Fig. 3d) shows clearly the lattice fringes, which are parallel to one of the edges of the TiO2 nanosheets. The lattice spacing is ca 0.35 nm, corresponding to the (101) planes of anatase TiO2. According to the symmetries of anatase TiO2, the two flat and square surfaces in the crystal structure of nanosheets can be assigned to {001} facets with percentage of ca. 61% calculated by the method reported elsewhere.21

Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the samples Gx (x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0) in comparison to the pattern of GO. As can be seen from this figure, only anatase phases of TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272) was observed in pure TiO2 (sample G0) and graphene/TiO2 composite photocatalysts (samples G0.2, G0.5, G1.0, G2.0 and G5.0). For GO, the XRD peak at 9.8° (Fig. 4, pattern g) corresponds to the (001) interlayer spacing of 0.90 nm, which matches well the values reported in the literature.44,46 Notably, no characteristic diffraction peaks of GO and graphene were observed in the all graphene/TiO2 composites. This can be ascribed to the fact that the regular stacking of GO was destroyed by the reduction process under the microwave-hydrothermal conditions and could not be resolved by XRD.

The porous structure and BET surface areas of graphene/TiO2 composites and pure TiO2 are investigated using nitrogen adsorption–desorption. Fig. 5 displays the nitrogen sorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution curves (inset in Fig. 5) for the G0 and G1.0 samples. The nitrogen sorption isotherms for the aforementioned two samples are similar and display hysteresis loops at relative pressures (P/P0) close to unity, indicating the presence of large mesopores and macropores, which can be categorized as type IV according to IUPAC classification.42,47 These isotherms exhibit H3 hysteresis loops associated with the presence of slit-like pores.42,47 The pore-size distributions (inset in Fig. 5) of the G0 and G1.0 samples are broad in the range from 2 to over 100 nm, indicating the existence of mesopores and macropores. Table 1 shows that all graphene/TiO2 composite samples have larger specific surface areas than pure TiO2. This is due to the presence of graphene in the composites, which has an extremely high surface area (theoretical value of 2600 m2 g−1). It is reasonable to conclude that the BET specific surface area increases with increasing amount of graphene.

UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples Gx (x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0) are shown in Fig. 6. All the samples studied display typical absorption with an intense transition in the UV region, mediated by the intrinsic band gap absorption of TiO2 resulting from the electron transitions from the valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB) (O2p → Ti3d). With the introduction of graphene, the graphene/TiO2 composites (samples G0.2, G0.5, G1.0, G2.0 and G5.0, Fig. 6b–e) display the same absorption edge as pure TiO2 (samples G0, Fig. 6a), implying that carbon was not incorporated to the lattice of TiO2 and the layered graphene was only a substrate for immobilization of TiO2 nanosheets.43 In general, anatase TiO2 shows no absorption above its fundamental absorption edge (around 400 nm).43 In contrast, graphene/TiO2 composites extend their broad background absorption in the visible-light region. This can be attributed to the presence of graphene in the graphene/TiO2 composites. Also, the composite samples show stronger broad background absorption with increasing graphene content, supported by the color change from white to grey (inset in Fig. 6).

3.2. Photocatalytic activity and mechanism
Photocatalytic H2-production activity on various samples was evaluated under xenon arc lamp irradiation using methanol as a scavenger. Control experiments indicated that no appreciable hydrogen production was detected in the absence of either irradiation or photocatalyst, suggesting that hydrogen was produced by photocatalytic reactions on the photocatalyst. Fig. 7 presents a comparison of the photocatalytic H2-production activity of the samples G0, G0.2, G0.5, G1.0, G2.0, GC5.0 and 1.0 wt% graphene/Degussa P25 composites (P1.0). As can be seen from this figure, the graphene content has a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. For the graphene content = 0, the sample G0 shows a very low photocatalytic activity because of the rapid recombination between CB electrons and VB holes in pure TiO2 and the presence of a large over potential in the production of H2. After introducing only a small amount of graphene sheets, the activity of the sample G0.2 is remarkably enhanced and increased ∼28 times. The photocatalytic activity of the samples further increased with increasing graphene content from 0.2 to 1.0%. The highest H2-production rate, obtained for the G1.0 sample (graphene content = 1.0 wt%), is 736 μmol h−1 g−1 with a 3.1% apparent quantum efficiency. This value exceeded by 41 times that of pure TiO2 (sample G0). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that an inexpensive metal-free carbon material can be used as an effective co-catalyst for photocatalytic water splitting. When graphene content is higher than 1.0 wt%, a further increase in graphene content leads to a reduction of the photocatalytic activity. Especially, at graphene content = 5.0 wt%, the photocatalytic activity of the sample G5.0 has a drastic decrease. This is probably due to the increase in the opacity and light scattering of G5.0, and high graphene load shielding the TiO2 from absorbing UV light, which resulted in rapid decrease of irradiation passing through the reaction suspension solution (see Fig. 6).23,25 The present results are similar to the previous studies showing that a suitable loading content of graphene is crucial for optimizing the photocatalytic behavior of graphene–TiO2 composites for pollutant degradation.12,17
 Fig. 7  (a) Comparison of the photocatalytic activity of the G0, G0.2, G0.5, G1.0, G2.0, G5.0 and P1.0 samples for the photocatalytic H2 production from methanol aqueous solution under UV light irradiation. 
For comparison, the photocatalytic H2-production activity of 1.0 wt% graphene/P25 TiO2 nanoparticle composites (sample P1.0) has also been tested and analyzed. As shown in Fig. 7, the sample P1.0 shows a relatively lower activity (456 μmol h−1 g−1) than the graphene/TiO2 nanosheet composites (sample G1.0), implying that the close interfacial contact and strong interaction between TiO2 nanosheets and graphene sheets with face-to-face orientation play an important role in the enhancement of photocatalytic activity for TiO2 by facilitating the separation of electron and hole pairs.
The high H2-production activity of the samples G0.2, G0.5, G1.0 and G2.0 under UV-light irradiation can be understood as illustrated in Fig. 8. Under UV-light illumination, the VB electrons (e−) of TiO2 are excited to CB, creating holes (h+) in the VB. Normally, these charge carriers quickly recombine and only a fraction of the electrons and holes participate in the photocatalytic reaction, resulting in low reactivity.48,49 However, when TiO2 was modified by graphene sheets, these photogenerated electrons on the CB of TiO2 tend to transfer to graphene sheets, leading to hole–electron separation. It has been reported that the two-dimensional π-conjugation structure of graphene sheets facilitates the transfer of photo-induced electrons and can perform as an excellent electron acceptor.38,50
 Fig. 8  (a) Schematic illustration for the charge transfer and separation in the graphene-modified TiO2 nanosheets system under UV light irradiation; (b) proposed mechanism for photocatalytic H2-production under UV light irradiation. 
Moreover, because the potential (−0.08 V vs. SHE, pH = 0) of graphene/graphene˙− is lightly lower than the CB level (about −0.24 V) of anatase TiO2, the photoinduced electrons in the CB can be further transferred to graphene sheets.8,22,51 Since the potential of graphene/graphene˙− was about −0.08 V (vs. SHE, pH = 0);8,51 it can be expected to act as a co-catalyst to reduce proton efficiently (E0H+/H2 = 0 V vs. SHE, pH = 0). Therefore, under UV-light irradiation, the photoinduced electrons on the CB of TiO2 are transferred to graphene sheets and then effectively reduce proton to produce H2 molecules. This also retards the recombination of photoinduced electrons and holes, and meanwhile suppresses the reverse reaction by separating the evolution sites of hydrogen and oxygen. Consequently, high photocatalytic H2-production activity is achieved over TiO2 samples as a result of graphene modification. The major reaction steps in this photocatalytic water splitting mechanism under UV-light irradiation are summarized by following eqn (2–4). (2) graphene (e−) + 2H+ → graphene + H2(3) TiO2(h+) + CH3OH + 6OH− → TiO2 + CO2 + 5H2O(4)
In the previous studies, the above assumptions are often confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) because it can provide useful information about the efficiency of charge carrier trapping and recombination in semiconductor particles since the PL emission comes from the recombination of free charge carriers.43,44 In Fig. 9 we present the suitable PL measurement for pure TiO2 (sample G0) and graphene/TiO2 composite (sample G1.0). As can be seen from this figure, the PL spectrum of the graphene/TiO2 composites is similar to that of pure TiO2. The strong peak located at ca. 397 nm is attributed to the emission of band gap transition with the energy of light approximately equal to the band gap energy of anatase (387.5 nm).43 The other four peaks observed in the wavelength ranging from 440 to 500 nm are attributed to excitonic PL, which mainly result from surface oxygen vacancies and defects.43 Obviously, in comparison to pure TiO2 (sample G0), the intensity of PL signal for the G1.0 composite sample is much lower. This indicates that the composite has a lower recombination rate of electrons and holes under UV-light irradiation. This is ascribed to the fact that the electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band and then transferred to graphene sheets due to its excellent electronic conductivity, preventing a direct recombination of electrons and holes.
 Fig. 9  Comparison of the photoluminescence spectra of the G0 and G1.0 samples. 
To give further evidence to support the above suggested photocatalytic water splitting mechanism, we used another methodology to detect the transient photocurrent responses. Fig. 10 shows the I–t curves for the samples G0 and G1.0 with several on-off cycles of intermittent UV-light irradiation. As can be seen from this figure the photocurrent value rapidly decreases to zero as soon as the light turns off, and the photocurrent comes back to a constant value when the light is on again. These results are well reproducible. In addition, the photocurrent curves of the aforementioned two samples display the same shapes including an anodic photocurrent spike at the initial irradiation and a cathodic spike at the end of irradiation. The initial anodic photocurrent spike is caused by the separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs within the photo-electrode: holes move to the TiO2 surface where they are trapped or captured by reduced species in the electrolyte, while the electrons are transported to the back contact via TiO2 or graphene.43,52

After the spike current has been attained, a continuous decrease of the photocurrent with time can be observed in that holes accumulated at the TiO2 surface, competitively recombined with electrons from TiO2 conduction band, instead of being trapped or captured by reduced species in the electrolyte. In other words, the decay is mainly determined by the efficiency of the transfer of conduction band electrons towards back contact.43,52 After the equilibration of competitive separation and recombination of electron–hole pairs, the photocurrent remains constant. On the other hand, when the light is switched off, due to the back reaction of TiO2 conduction electrons with holes trapped at the TiO2 surface, a cathodic spike is formed. In the present case, the stable photocurrent value of sample G1.0 is about 3 times as high as that of G0. This obvious enhancement of photocurrent indicates smaller recombination and more efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs at the graphene/TiO2 interface: holes diffuse towards the TiO2 surface, where they are trapped or captured by reduced species in the electrolyte, while the electrons are effectively transported to the back contact via graphene sheets.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed a microwave-hydrothermal method for the fabrication of highly active graphene-modified TiO2 nanosheets composite photocatalysts for H2 production. Graphene was shown to be an effective co-catalyst to enhance the photocatalytic H2-production activity of TiO2 nanosheets and its content has a significant influence on the activity of TiO2. The optimal graphene content was determined to be 1.0 wt% and the corresponding hydrogen production rate was 736 μmol h−1 g−1 with a quantum efficiency of 3.1%, which exceeded that of pure TiO2 nanosheets by more than 41 times. In comparison to the graphene/P25 TiO2 nanoparticles composite, the graphene/TiO2 nanosheet composites showed an enhanced photocatalytic H2 production because of the intimate interaction between TiO2 nanosheets and graphene sheets with face-to-face orientation, which facilitates the separation of electron and hole pairs. The potential of graphene/graphene˙− is deemed to be less negative than the conduction band of TiO2 and more negative than H+/H2 potential, which favors the electron transfer from CB of TiO2 to graphene and the reduction of H+, thus enhancing photocatalytic H2-production activity. The PL and photocurrent response results further support that the suggested mechanism. This study demonstrates for the first time that an inexpensive metal-free carbon material can be used as an effective co-catalyst for photocatalytic water splitting.
