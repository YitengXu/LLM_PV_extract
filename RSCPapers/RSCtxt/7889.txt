    , Accepted 15th December 2014First published on 22nd December 2014AbstractStabilities of ITO-containing and ITO-free organic solar cells were investigated under simulated AM 1.5G illumination and under concentrated natural sunlight. In both cases ITO-free devices exhibit high stability, while devices containing ITO show degradation of their photovoltaic performance. The accelerated degradation under concentrated sunlight (of up to 20 suns) in ITO-containing devices was found to be reversible. Dark exposure of degraded samples can partly restore performance. A possible underlying mechanism for such a phenomenon is discussed.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPV) constitute a promising low-cost approach for solar energy conversion. In order to make an impact on the high power market in the longer term, OPV should provide high power conversion efficiency, low production costs and long term operational stability. The low cost potential is based on the use of low-cost materials and substrates and the very high production speeds which can be reached by roll-to-roll printing and coating techniques.1–7 Removal of expensive indium tin oxide (ITO) from the architecture of organic solar cells contributes towards further decreasing the manufacturing cost. Substitution of ITO by a composite electrode, containing highly conductive PEDOT:PSS and current collecting grids,8–11 was demonstrated to produce large area devices without efficiency losses and allow solution processing of the bottom electrode. The latter is more cost-efficient in comparison with vacuum deposition of ITO.12
Further steps towards the development of large-area OPVs require highly stable devices with a long lifetime. Earlier, it has been shown that ITO-free devices exhibit higher stability compared to identical devices using the ITO-electrode.13 However, the origin of the degradation was not discussed. Several attempts have been made in the comparison of ITO-free devices with different architectures.14 The understanding of the degradation mechanism in devices with different architectures is a first step to get stable OPV devices and modules.
In order to achieve an understanding of the degradation mechanism in ITO-containing and ITO-free devices, we compare the stabilities of two types of organic solar cells (ITO-containing and ITO-free) under simulated “1 sun” illumination (1 sun = 100 mW cm−2) and accelerated degradation of these devices under concentrated natural sunlight.15–19
2. Experimental
A series of ITO-based and ITO-free devices were prepared on glass substrates. The devices had following layer sequences:
glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF:Al/encapsulation;
glass/Ag-grids/h.c.PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF:Al/encapsulation.
The schematic illustration of the devices is shown in Fig. 1a. The materials used for the device preparation were the following: Clevios P VP AI 4083 PEDOT:PSS from Heraeus; high conducting Orgacon PEDOT:PSS from Agfa-Gevaert; Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) from Plextronics and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) from Solenne BV. The devices were prepared as reported earlier.11,20–22 All devices were encapsulated either with thin-films23 or with metal lids using a Huntsman Araldites 2014-1 sealer. To prevent side leakage, prior to encapsulation, the organic layers were structured via laser ablation. The active area of the devices was 3.76 cm2.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic illustration of device architectures; (b) relative efficiency change in the devices under 1 sun illumination, at 45 °C. 
The one sun lifetime test was done by measuring the performance of the devices over time. In between the measurements the samples were light soaked with a constant illumination by a G2 light engine combined with a S-bulb (Solaronix), which provides simulated 1.5AM conditions, although with a lower UV and IR content. The temperature of the samples was 45 °C during light soaking. Current–voltage (I–V) curves were measured using simulated AM 1.5 global solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a WXS-300S-50 solar simulator (WACOM Electric Co.).
The cell exposure to concentrated sunlight (20 suns) was performed in a Sede Boker (desert Negev, Israel). Natural sunlight was concentrated using a dual-axis tracking flat heliostat that reflects light into the laboratory, where a flat mirror (with a hole at its center) tilted at 45° redirects the light upward to a 526 mm-diameter paraboloidal dish of a numerical aperture of 0.4, whose focal plane is just below the tilted mirror.24,25 The light intensity was moderated by a louvered shutter between the heliostat and the flat indoor mirror. It should be noted that the spectrum measured at ‘noon time ±2 to 3 hours' at Sede Boqer (Lat. 30.8°N, Lon. 34.8°E, Alt. 475 m) is very close to the AM 1.5G spectrum.25 Flux uniformity in both systems was achieved using kaleidoscopes placed between the paraboloid focal point and the cell. The incident power of concentrated sunlight was measured using a pyrometer with 5% accuracy.

I–V measurements of the cells before and after their exposure to concentrated sunlight were performed using the 1.5G spectrum by opening a shutter above the cell and illuminating the cell during I–V tracing only (<1 s) to avoid excessive degradation and temperature variations. In addition to the conventional PV characterization under 1 sun, we performed I–V measurements with varied sunlight intensities (up to 5 suns). EQE spectra were measured using a PV spectral response measurement system (“TECHNOEXAN” Ltd, Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute, Russia).
For accelerated lifetime testing using concentrated sunlight only devices with thin film encapsulation were selected. Devices with metal lids cannot be vastly cooled down during concentrated sun illumination because of the space between the glass substrate with an OPV stack and a metal lid. The nitrogen space (devices were encapsulated in a nitrogen atmosphere) between the front and the back sides of the sample slows down the cooling process during illumination. In such a sample increasing of illumination doze will significantly increase the temperature. Thin-film encapsulation enables the formation of a very thin and flat stack which can be cooled down to 30 °C using an integrated cooling system even at 20 suns illumination.
3. Results and discussion
All devices show very high stability in the dark at room temperature. The combination of “1 sun” simulated light and elevated temperature (45 °C) shows a very rapid degradation of the ITO-based devices (Fig. 1b). The efficiency of the ITO-free devices remains almost unchanged for 1000 hours. The same trend is observed for both devices with thin film and metal lid encapsulation. It indicates that the degradation of ITO-based devices is not associated with the encapsulation type, but is intrinsic in nature.
Identical devices were exposed to concentrated sunlight. Fig. 2 presents the I–V curves and EQE spectrum of the ITO-free devices before and after the illumination by 20 suns for 60 minutes. One can see no degradation of EQE and short-circuit current (Isc) and very slight degradation of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and the fill-factor (FF). Further illumination of the ITO-free cell by 20 suns for two successive periods of 60 minutes was shown to result in a similar behavior. Fig. 3 depicts light intensity dependence of the device principal photovoltaic parameters measured in this experiment.

The Isc of fresh cells exhibits a linear light intensity dependence of up to ∼3 suns (Fig. 3). However, under higher solar concentrations (above 3 suns) the sub-linear dependence of Isc on light intensity is evident. The FF decreases monotonically with light intensity (Fig. 3). These results are in agreement with our previous observations.19 In inorganic PV such behavior is attributed the cell series resistance losses that become more pronounced at high light intensities.26 In OPV, in addition to the conventional series resistance limitation, a number of underlying mechanisms for the sub-linear photocurrent can be suggested: enhancement of the voltage dependence of photocurrent,27 space charge limitation,28–30 unbalanced transport of holes and electrons, also known as “μτ-limited” process29 and bimolecular recombination.31–33 One cannot distinguish these mechanisms just by the analysis of I–V curves and dependencies of the PV parameters on light intensity. We will use the term “charge collection limitation” to refer to such characteristic behavior.
Exposure of the ITO-free cell to 20 suns did not affect the general trend of light intensity dependencies of its PV principal parameters (Fig. 3). A slight intensity-independent decrease in Voc and FF was observed. The Isc did not show any degradation for up to ∼3 suns. Above ∼3 suns the Isc degradation of the cell was recorded and the sub-linear dependence of Isc on light intensity was found to be more pronounced.
On the other hand, the same light exposure (20 suns, 60 minutes) of an ITO-containing cell resulted in significant degradation of its PV performance (Fig. 4a). In particular, very strong decrease in FF and Isc was observed after the exposure. After the light exposure, the cell was stored in the dark and measured after two and five days. I–V measurements showed that during the dark storage the cells were partially recovered. It suggests that the observed degradation is (at least partly) reversible.

I–V (a) and EQE (b) curves for an ITO-containing cell measured before and after the illumination by 20 suns for 60 minutes as well as after 2 and 5 days of keeping the cell in the dark after the exposure. 
It should be noted, however, that the exposure did not affect the cell EQE spectrum (Fig. 4b). We explain the apparent contradiction between the EQE stability and Isc and FF substantial degradation by postulating that no photocurrent degradation occurred under the sunlight exposure. The Isc (and FF) degraded due to the increase of the cell series resistance during the exposure. Indeed, the light intensity in the EQE setup is lower by ∼3 orders of magnitude than that of solar light even at 1 sun. The series resistance losses are neglected under low light intensity (in the EQE measurements), while they become significant under solar irradiation (I–V measurements under 1 sun and higher solar concentrations). Our hypothesis is supported by I–V measurements with varied light intensities (Fig. 5).

The difference between the two types of the investigated cells is only in the front contacts (ITO/PEDOT:PSS vs. Ag/PEDOT:PSS). This fact brings us to the conclusion that the degradation of an ITO-containing cell is related to the degradation of the ITO layer or/and its interface with the PEDOT:PSS and the corresponding increase in the cell series resistance.
In order to check whether the ITO resistance and transmittance change due to light exposure, a non-encapsulated ITO-coated glass (the same as used for OPV cells) was irradiated for 60 minutes under 50 suns under the same cooling conditions as in the cell experiment. Prior to and after the light exposure, the absorption and resistance of the ITO film was measured (the resistance was measured between two contacts ∼2 cm distanced). The absorption results are given in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  UV-Vis spectra of an ITO film (not encapsulated) measured before and after the solar exposure by 50 suns for 1 hour. 
The light dose in the ITO sample exposure was greater than that for the ITO-containing cell exposure by a factor of 2.5. Nevertheless, no absorption degradation was recorded, except for a minor decrease in the UV part. The resistance measurements did not show any changes due to the light exposure. We can conclude that the ITO by itself is stable even though it was not encapsulated.
Although bare ITO demonstrates high electrical and optical stability at concentrated sunlight, there are many publications which point to instability of the ITO/active layer interface34,35 and instability of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface in particular.36,37 We speculate that the degradation of the cell can be explained by the interaction of ITO with the PEDOT:PSS at their interface. The interaction is attributed to the acidity of the PEDOT:PSS which facilitates the etching of ITO. The etching of ITO is accompanied by the transport of etch products through the PEDOT:PSS film,38,39 the so called indium migration. Interaction of ITO and PEDOT:PSS under non-accelerated conditions leads to a slow degradation of the ITO electrode and reduction of OPV performance. However, in accelerated lifetime test the interaction between ITO and PEDOT:PSS occurs much faster than the transport of interaction products from the interface can occur. Thus, just after accelerated degradation most of the etch products still stay at the interface, and such surface modification of ITO impairs the hole injection mechanism from the anode through the interface layer to PEDOT:PSS. Later, the etched products diffuse into the bulk of PEDOT:PSS and photoactive layer. The contact between ITO and PEDOT:PSS is improved and organic solar cells show reanimated performance.
We can suggest the following mechanism for the conductivity loss at the ITO interface. The low resistivity of the ITO film is believed to be due to the large free carrier density, which is in the range of 1020 cm−3 to 1021 cm−3. It is generally accepted that these free carriers are generated by two processes:40,41 (1) Sn atom substitution of the In atom and giving out one extra electron, and (2) oxygen vacancies acting as two electron donors. Due to its complicate crystal structure (80 atoms in an In2O3 unit cell), the conducting mechanism of ITO is still not fully understood.40 Decomposition of ITO due to interaction with PEDOT:PSS leads to decrease of oxygen vacancies at the ITO interface, resulting in conductivity loss. However, migration of In (and probably Sn) ions from the interface restores oxygen vacancies at the ITO interface and the reanimated current collection in OPV devices. It is important to mention that the fill factor and Isc did not reach initial values because the resistance of the ITO electrode was increased due to partial decomposition of ITO.
The interaction of ITO and PEDOT:PSS under non-accelerated conditions is intensively described in the literature.38,42,43 The main conditions influencing the interaction are the acidity of PEDOT:PSS,43 humidity level (especially for non-encapsulated samples),38,42 processing and curing conditions of PEDOT:PSS (which is responsible for the amount of residual water in PEDOT:PSS),44 surface treatments of ITO,45etc. It is obvious from our study that concentrated sunlight also accelerates the degradation of the devices. Most likely the degradation occurs at the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface. As shown above no effect of concentrated sunlight on pure ITO has been observed. Thus, the effect of concentrated sun light on the PEDOT:PSS layer is of great interest.
Effects of UV-light irradiation on the conductivity and work function of PEDOT:PSS have been intensively investigated.46–48 However, in most of the publications the UV treatments were performed in air or by applying UV-ozone. Nagata et al.48 have clarified the respective effects of UV light irradiation and exposure to ozone gas on the properties of PEDOT:PSS. They have found that the main role of UV light is to decompose the chemical bonds in the PEDOT:PSS, resulting in a decrease of conductivity, while the ozone and atomic oxygen are absorbed and oxidize the surface, leading to an increase of the work function. Xing et al.49 describe a simple method to increase the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film by exposure to UV light in a vacuum. The difference in the results of Nagata et al. and Zing et al. (decrease and increase of conductivity, respectively) can be explained by the presence or absence of oxygen during irradiation. From both studies it is clear that 254 nm UV light can break chemical bonds such as C–C, C–H, and C–OH. For the PEDOT:PSS film, PSS is more detrimental under 254 nm UV exposure than PEDOT because the conjugated parts in the PEDOT chain has a larger bonding energy than single bonds in the PSS chain.48 Hong et al.50 have reported that there are two kinds of bonds in PSS that can be broken under UV exposure: the cleavage of a α-hydrogen bond generates polystyrene radicals, and the second cleavage happens between the sulfonic acid group and the phenyl group.
We speculate that decomposed products of PEDOT:PSS and especially sulfonic acid derivatives etch ITO much faster than non-decomposed PEDOT:PSS. The etch products, which are mostly In and Sn ions, will migrate to the bulk. However, as discussed above, after the concentrated sunlight exposure, which accelerate decomposition of PEDOT:PSS and therefore accelerated interaction with ITO, most of etched In and Sn ions are still located at the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface and create effective barrier for the charges. Organic solar cells at this point look completely degraded. Solar cells still show reasonable voltage, but the fill factor and current are significantly reduced, indicating the degradation of the electrodes. However, exposure in the dark and migration of etch products from the interface can restore the device performance.
4. Conclusions
Operational stabilities of ITO-containing and ITO-free organic solar cells were compared. ITO-containing OPV cells exhibited much faster degradation of their PV performance under the exposure of simulated one sunlight and natural concentrated sunlight. The accelerated degradation under concentrated sunlight was found to be reversible and may be attributed to the increase in the cell series resistance limitation. The ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface is suggested to be responsible for the degradation. The reversible degradation effect under concentrated sunlight is attributed to a slow migration of the etch products from the interface. Dark exposure provides sufficient time for the etch product to migrate to the bulk, and thereby reanimate the PV performance.
It is worth remembering that operational lifetime under real conditions consists of alternating illumination and dark exposures during day and night times, respectively. The performance of the cell can degrade under illumination. However, during the night the reaction products can migrate to the bulk, thereby restoring the device performance. This fact should be taken into consideration when the indoor lifetime tests are performed with constant illumination under one sun or accelerated conditions. This problem should be addressed in a further detailed study comparing the results of outdoor and indoor stability assessments of OPV cells with various device architectures.
