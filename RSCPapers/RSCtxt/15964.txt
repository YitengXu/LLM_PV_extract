    , Accepted 4th July 2016First published on 4th July 2016AbstractA novel two-dimensional ultrathin TaC/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheet hybrid was employed as a co-catalyst to Pd nanoparticles (Pd/TaC-G). Compared to Pd/C, Pd/TaC-G exhibits remarkably enhanced catalytic activity, resistance to poisonous intermediates and durability for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Experimental results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal the synergetic chemical coupling between the Pd nanoparticles and the TaC/RGO nanosheet hybrid, which is likely the reason for the enhanced catalytic activity of Pd/TaC-G. This work established a new strategy to overcome the drawbacks of the noble metal catalyst through improving the catalytic activity, resistance to poisonous intermediates and durability via a two-dimensional hybrid, providing a new approach to develop the next generation catalysts in DMFCs.
Introduction
Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been attracting increasing attention as power sources for automotive and portable electrical devices with some unquestionable advantages over analogous devices fed with hydrogen.1,2 Methanol exhibits higher volumetric energy density, and its storage and transport are much easier than hydrogen. However, the typical DMFCs, operated in acidic media with anode catalysts containing Pt and making use of solid electrolytes constituted by proton exchange membranes of the Nafion family, suffer from some serious disadvantages, such as low abundance and high cost of Pt, CO poisoning of the Pt-based catalysts, effective methanol crossover, degradation of the membrane, and corrosion of the carbon materials.2–6 The optimal utilization of Pt has been widely studied in the past few decades,7,8 including alloys of Pt with a second metal (such as Ru,9 Y (ref. 10) or Pd (ref. 11)), nanoarchitectures with well-defined shapes (such as core/shell structures,12 nanowires,13,14 nanotubes,15 and nanocubes16) and co-catalysts or supports with a synergetic chemical coupling effect.17–19 In addition, Pd is emerging as an attractive replacement for Pt in DMFCs. Pd has some advantages over Pt, i.e. it is more abundant in nature and less expensive and it is highly active for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in an alkaline electrolyte, where also non-noble metals are sufficiently stable for electrochemical applications.2 Within this context, several approaches were applied to further increase the MOR efficiency of Pd, including alloys that combine the merits of Pd with other metals,20,21 the synthesis of Pd nanoarchitectures with well-defined shapes,22–24 and the introduction of co-catalysts.25,26
Due to the similarity of their electronic states to Pt at the Fermi level, group VB and VIB transition metal carbides (TMCs, such as WC/W2C, MoC/Mo2C, VC and TaC) exhibit Pt-like behaviors for catalytic applications in many chemical reactions.27–30 These TMCs show dramatic catalytic activity in a number of electrochemical energy conversion applications, including HER,31–34 photocatalysts,30 solar cells,35 and fuel cells.36–38 Specifically, these TMCs have been used as a co-catalyst to Pd that show enhanced catalytic activities for MOR.25,39 The catalytic activities of nanocatalysts strongly depend on their electronic state and local atomic structure, which is highly related to their shape, so the controllable synthesis of nanocatalysts with well-defined shapes has attracted enormous interest with the aim of tailoring their catalytic properties for applications.40–42 For this purpose, many methods have been developed to synthesize TMCs with well-defined shapes to optimize the catalytic activities of TMCs.37,43–45 However, it is not facile to obtain two-dimensional TMC nanosheets, which have unique advantages including high mechanical integrity, short charge transport path, high surface-to-volume ratio and vectorial electron transport.46 Herein, we firstly report the TaC nanosheet/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheet hybrid as a co-catalyst to Pd nanoparticles for enhanced MOR activity, originating from the synergetic chemical coupling effect between the Pd and TaC/RGO nanosheets, which was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analyses.
Experimental
Synthesis of graphite oxide (GO)
The GO powders were prepared through a modified Hummers method, which is described as follows. Firstly, 46 mL of H2SO4 (98 wt%) was added into a beaker (2 L) in an ice bath. After the temperature of H2SO4 (98 wt%) was decreased to 2 °C, 2.0 g of graphite powders (325 mesh, XFNANO Material Technologic Co. Ltd., Nanjing, China), 10.0 g of KMnO4 and 5.0 g of NaNO3 were slowly added into the beaker under vigorously stirring to keep the temperature of the suspension lower than 15 °C. Then, the temperature of the suspension was increased to 40 °C for 35 min, 50 ml of deionized water was slowly added to the suspension and the temperature was maintained at 95 °C for 30 min. At the end of the reaction, the color of the suspension changed from dark brown to yellow. Finally, the mixture was filtered and washed with 1 mol L−1 HCl aqueous solution (250 mL) and plenty of deionized water to remove metal ions.
Synthesis of the ultrathin TaC/RGO nanosheet hybrid
The synthesis process of the ultrathin TaC/RGO nanosheet hybrid (TaC-G) was described as follows. 0.1 g of GO powder was dissolved in 200 mL of deionized water and then sonicated for 2 h to form chemically exfoliated graphene oxide dispersion (0.5 mg ml−1). 0.05 g of K2TaF7 was added to the graphene oxide dispersion; the mixture was sonicated for 30 min, stirred continuously at 90 °C until almost all the moisture evaporated and it turned into a hydrogel-like mixture, and then freeze dried. The collected mixture was annealed under argon atmosphere at 1200 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. After cooling to room temperature, the product was collected for further characterization and catalyst systhesis.
Preparation of Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G catalysts
The Pd/TaC-G catalyst was prepared via a chemical adsorption/reduction procedure. In a typical procedure, 100 mg of TaC-G was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water, and the mixture was magnetically stirred in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min. Then, 7.0 ml of sodium chloropalladite (9.6 mgPd ml−1) was added dropwise to the ink under magnetic stirring. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 10 by 0.1 mol L−1 KOH solution. After stirring and ultrasonication for 30 min, the mixture was concentrated by rotary evaporation. The mixture was reduced under flowing H2/N2 at 300 °C for 2.0 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Finally, the powder was cooled to room temperature under pure N2. The sample was collected for further characterization and catalytic activity test.
For comparison, Pd supported on Vulcan XC-72R carbon powder (Cabot Corp., USA) (Pd/C) and RGO (Pd/G) were also prepared by using the same procedure.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a D/Max-III (Rigaku Co., Japan) with Cu Kα radiation, operating at 30 kV and 30 mA. The 2θ angle was from 15° to 90° at a scan rate of 6° min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using an XPS apparatus (ESCALAB 250, Thermo-VG Scientific Ltd.). Structural and morphological characterization was carried out using a field emission transmission electron microscope (FETEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30) operating at 300 kV. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy–energy dispersive spectroscopy (HAADF-STEM–EDS) elemental mapping analyses were performed at 300 kV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out using a scanning probe microscope (SPM, Dimension Fastscan, Bruker). The Pd loadings of the Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G catalysts were measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, IRIS(HR)).
Pd K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of Pd/TaC-G was measured in total electron yield transmission mode at the BL14W1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China. The electron beam energy was 3.5 GeV, and the stored current was 240 mA (top-up). A 38 pole wiggler with the maximum magnetic field of 1.2 T inserted in the straight section of the storage ring was used. XAS data were collected using a fixed-exit double-crystal Si (311) monochromator. A 64 element Ge solid-state detector was used to collect the transmission signal, and the energy was calibrated using Pd foil at the third ionization chamber.
Electrochemical measurements
An Autolab PGSTAT 302 (ECO Chemie, Netherlands) electrochemical workstation was used to perform the electrochemical measurements, which were conducted in a thermostat-controlled standard three-electrode cell at 30 °C; a piece of platinum plate electrode (1 × 1 cm2) was used as the counterelectrode, a Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode, and a glassy carbon disk (A = 0.2825 cm2) as the working electrode. The catalytic activities of the catalysts were investigated by depositing samples on a glassy carbon disk with the loading of 0.024 mgPd cm−2, prepared as follows: 5.0 mg of catalyst was first dispersed in 1.0 mL of ethanol and 1.0 mL of Nafion solution (0.05 wt%, DuPont, USA), and then the mixture was placed in an ultrasonic bath for an hour to form well-dispersed ink; a certain amount of the ink was then transferred onto the glass carbon electrode surface and dried under infrared lamp for a few minutes to obtain a catalyst thin film.
The MOR activities of the catalysts were carried out in an N2-saturated 1.0 mol L−1 KOH + 1.0 mol L−1 CH3OH solution. The potential range was controlled from −0.96 to 0.24 V (vs. Hg/HgO) with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Chronoamperometry was carried out at a fixed potential of −0.1 V (vs. Hg/HgO). Chronopotentiometry was carried out at a fixed current density of 10 mA cm−2.
CO stripping was performed in parallel experiments. Before CO stripping, the solution was saturated with CO by bubbling through the solution for 15 min. Then a fixed potential of −0.85 V (vs. Hg/HgO) was applied on the electrode for 15 min. Once the CO monolayer on the Pd surface was obtained, the electrolyte was purged with nitrogen gas for 15 min followed by CO stripping by positively sweeping the potential.
The accelerated durability test (ADT) was carried out by continuous potentiodynamic sweep between −0.96 and 0.24 V (vs. Hg/HgO) in N2-saturated 1.0 mol L−1 KOH + 1.0 mol L−1 CH3OH solution at 30 °C with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. After the ADT test, the MOR activities of the catalysts were recorded in fresh N2-saturated 1.0 mol L−1 KOH + 1.0 mol L−1 CH3OH solution with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
X-ray diffraction was used to characterize the TaC-G. As shown in Fig. S1,† a pure TaC phase was formed, which was identified by the distinct diffraction peaks at 2θ = 34.94°, 40.58°, 58.74°, 70.12°, 73.76° and 87.86°, indexed as the (111), (200), (220), (311), (220) and (400) planes of TaC (cubic, Fmm (225), PDF#35-0801). The diffraction peak at 2θ = 26.2° is a characteristic of the graphite (002) plane, demonstrating the reduction of graphene oxide after annealing.

Fig. 1a displays the typical atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of the TaC-G, showing a homogeneous distribution of TaC nanosheets on the RGO surface without agglomeration or overlayer. Besides, the similar shades of TaC nanosheet colors indicate uniform thickness distribution of the TaC nanosheets. Fig. 1b shows the height profile of the TaC-G nanosheet that was acquired from the red arrow in Fig. 1a, which goes across the edge of RGO. Two step heights of 1.45 nm and 3.60 nm are shown in Fig. 1b, indicating the thicknesses of the TaC and RGO nanosheets, respectively. The thickness distribution of the TaC nanosheets calculated from more than 100 nanosheets reveals an ultrathin distribution in the 0.8–2.0 nm range (Fig. S2†). The morphology and structure of TaC-G were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). The typical low magnification TEM image of TaC-G is presented in Fig. 1c, and the TaC nanosheets anchored on the surface of the RGO nanosheet with the size of 10–35 nm (Fig. S3†), which is also identified by the higher magnification TEM image (Fig. 1d and e). The contrast of the TaC nanosheets in the TEM images is very low, which also means that the TaC nanosheets are ultrathin. Fig. 1e and the inset display HRTEM images of TaC-G, showing the well-resolved lattice fringe with an interplanar distance of 0.256 nm, corresponding to the TaC (111) plane. Fig. S4† shows the EDS pattern of the TaC-G, indicating the co-existence of C, O and Ta.

Fig. 2 demonstrates the morphology and structure of the as-prepared Pd/TaC-G. Fig. 2a and b present the low magnification TEM images of Pd/TaC-G, and it is observed that the Pd nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed on both RGO and TaC nanosheets and rarely agglomerated. Fig. S5† shows the size distribution of the Pd grain size in Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G (based on the TEM images of Pd/C and Pd/G in Fig. S6†), calculated from more than 100 nanocrystals; the mean particle sizes of Pd nanoparticles in Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G are 3.0 nm, 3.2 nm and 2.8 nm, respectively. Fig. 2c shows the HRTEM image of Pd/TaC-G, with the blue dotted curved line marking the boundary of the TaC nanosheet and the red arrows pointing to the Pd nanoparticles, revealing the close anchoring between the Pd nanoparticles and the TaC nanosheet, which could boost the synergistic effect between the TaC nanosheet and Pd, leading to enhanced MOR activity. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern of Pd/TaC-G that was acquired from Fig. 2c is presented in Fig. 2d, and it shows the Pd and TaC simultaneously: the three bright spots marked by dashed parallelogram index the (111), (311) and (422) planes of TaC, while the two bright spots marked by dashed circles indicate the (111) and (200) planes of Pd. Fig. 2e shows the close-up images acquired from the three dotted square regions (region 1 contains the boundary, and regions 2 and 3 are from the upper surface of the TaC nanosheet) in Fig. 2c; all images reveal the close anchoring of Pd nanoparticles on the TaC nanosheet surface, which are identified by the well-resolved lattice fringes of 0.256 nm and 0.227 nm that correspond to the TaC (111) and Pd (111) planes, respectively. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) characterization and EDS elemental mapping of Pd/TaC-G were carried out to further analyze the structure and investigate the chemical composition of Pd/TaC-G, as shown in Fig. 2f and g. The elemental mapping images of Pd/TaC-G reveal the Ta and Pd distributions, which also confirm the distribution of Pd on both TaC and RGO nanosheets. In addition, the EDS pattern of the Pd/TaC-G reveals the co-existence of both Pd and Ta metals (Fig. S7†). The crystal phase composition of Pd/TaC-G was characterized by XRD, as shown in Fig. S8,† which identifies both Pd and TaC phases unambiguously. The peaks at 2θ of 40.06°, 46.23°, 67.83° and 81.67° correspond to the (111), (200), (220) and (311) facets of Pd, showing a typical face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. According to the ICP-AES results, the resulting wt% for Pd in the Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G catalysts are 37.7%, 37.6% and 39.8%, respectively. The resulting wt% for TaC is 23% in Pd/TaC-G.

The catalytic properties of the as-prepared Pd/TaC-G were investigated for direct methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). For comparison, the MOR activities of Pd/C and Pd/G were also investigated under the same conditions. Fig. 3a shows the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G in N2-saturated 1.0 mol L−1 KOH with the scan rate of 20 mV s−1 at 30 °C. These CVs possess five columbic features: (1) region A is associated with the oxidation of absorbed hydrogen and desorbed hydrogen (Pd–Habs/ads + OH− → Pd + H2O + e−); (2) region B corresponds to the adsorption of hydrogen; (3) region C occurs at a potential of about −0.4 V and it corresponds to the adsorption of hydroxyl groups (Pd + OH− ↔ Pd–OHads + e−); (4) region D is attributed to the formation of the palladium(II) oxide layer on the surface of the Pd nanoparticles (Pd–OHads + OH− ↔ Pd–O + H2O + e−); (5) region E is associated with the reduction of monolayer Pd–O (Pd–O + H2O + 2e− ↔ Pd + 2OH−).47,48 The adsorption of hydrogen and formation of the palladium(II) oxide layer on Pd/TaC-G are weaker than those of Pd/C and Pd/G, and the oxidation of adsorbed and desorbed hydrogen on Pd/TaC-G is stronger than those of Pd/C and Pd/G, which means the adsorption of methanol on Pd/TaC-G is more facilitative than those of Pd/C and Pd/G, which would result in higher MOR activity.49,50 The integral of peak E is commonly used to estimate the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) based on the columbic charge for the reduction of Pd–O, according to the equation: ECSA = Q/SL, where Q is the charge associated with Pd–O stripping, S is the proportionality coefficient with a value of 405 μC cm−2, which is used to relate charges with the peak area, assuming that a monolayer of Pd–O covers the surface, and L is the Pd loading.51 The ECSAs of Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G are 24.6 m2 gPd−1 and 32.3 m2 gPd−1, respectively, larger than Pd/C (21.1 m2 gPd−1), which mainly result from the dispersive role of RGO and the enhanced utilization of Pd NPs brought about by the TaC-G. The chemical surface areas (CSA (m2 gPd−1) = 6 × 103/ρd (ρ, density of Pd metal; d, diameter in nm)) of the Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G catalysts are 163.1 m2 gPd−1, 152.2 m2 gPd−1and 175.7 m2 gPd−1, and the Pd utilization (ECSA/CSA) values of the Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G catalysts are 0.13, 0.16 and 0.18, respectively.

The MOR activity of Pd/TaC-G was investigated in 1.0 mol L−1 KOH + 1.0 mol L−1 CH3OH solution. Fig. 3b compares the MOR activities of Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G at 50 mV s−1. The observed voltammetric curves are excellent signatures of methanol oxidation on both Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G electrodes. The peak current density of Pd/TaC-G (1850 mA mgPd−1) is much higher than those of Pd/C (599 mA mgPd−1) and Pd/G (944 mA mgPd−1). CO-stripping voltammetry is also adopted to obtain the ECSAs of Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G in this work, as shown in Fig. S9.† The ECSAs of Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G determined from CO stripping are 19.3 m2 gPd−1, 21.6 m2 gPd−1 and 29.3 m2 gPd−1, respectively, which are consistent with the results obtained from the CVs. Fig. S10† shows the comparison of the specific activities (jk, calculated from normalizing the electrode current to the ECSA that was obtained from CO stripping) of Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G. The Pd/TaC-G (1.81 mA cm−2) exhibits about 2.1 fold and 1.7 fold enhancement in specific activity compared to Pd/C (0.85 mA cm−2) and Pd/G (1.08 mA cm−2) at −0.2 V (vs. Hg/HgO), respectively. In addition, the ratio of the forward oxidation charge (Qf) to the reverse oxidation charge (Qb), Qf/Qb, is an important index of the catalyst tolerance to the poisoning COads-like intermediate species. A higher ratio indicates more effective removal of the COads-like intermediates on the catalyst surface.51 The Qf/Qb ratio of Pd/TaC-G is 2.82, which is higher than those of the Pd/C (2.30) and Pd/G catalysts (2.12), showing better catalyst tolerance of Pd/TaC-G.
According to the previous report,52 the generally accepted mechanism for methanol oxidation on Pd in alkaline medium can be summarized by reactions (a)–(g): Pd + CH3OH ↔ Pd–CH3OHads(a) Pd–CH3OHads + OH− → Pd–CH3Oads + H2O + e−(b) Pd–CH3Oads + OH− → Pd–CH2Oads + H2O + e−(c) Pd–CH2Oads + OH− → Pd–CHOads + H2O + e−(d) Pd–CHOads + OH− → Pd–COads + H2O + e−(e) Pd–COads + OH− → Pd–COOHads + H2O + e−(f) Pd–COOHads + OH− → Pd + CO2 + H2O + e−(g)
The coverage of the COads-like intermediates on the Pd active sites increases with continuous reaction, and it is one of the key factors for the deterioration of the Pd catalyst. For this purpose, the poisoning resistance of the catalysts was evaluated by a steady-state measurement with the respective chronopotentiometric curves for methanol oxidation on Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G catalysts at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3c). In the early stages, the potential that satisfies the identical applied anodic current density on Pd/TaC-G is −0.341 V (vs. Hg/HgO), much lower than those of Pd/C (−0.215 V vs. Hg/HgO) and Pd/G (−0.265 V vs. Hg/HgO), implying higher output voltage and power density. This result indicate that the overpotential of the COads-like intermediate oxidation on Pd/TaC-G is much lower than those of Pd/C and Pd/G. After operation at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 2833 s and 3928 s, the MOR on Pd/C and Pd/G cannot continue, while the MOR on Pd/TaC-G remains running at a lower potential for more than 6000 s. The above results prove that the Pd/TaC-G catalyst exhibits better electrocatalytic properties and better resistance to poisonous intermediates than those of Pd/C and Pd/G.
The stability of the catalysts under continuous operating conditions was examined by chronoamperometric measurements. Fig. 3d shows the chronoamperometric curves of Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G in 1.0 mol L−1 N2-saturated KOH containing 1.0 mol L−1 methanol at −0.1 V (vs. Hg/HgO). The Pd/TaC-G catalyst offers much higher current density than Pd/C and Pd/G at the initial chronoamperometric measurement. The initial current densities decrease on Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G catalysts, which could be ascribed to the accumulation of adsorbed poisonous COads-like intermediates on the surface active sites.53 It is found that the current responses decrease more quickly for Pd/C and Pd/G. At the end of the chronoamperometric measurement, the current density of Pd/TaC-G is 303 mA mgPd−1, 4.6 times and 2.4 times larger than those of Pd/C (85 mA mgPd−1) and Pd/G (124 mA mgPd−1), respectively.
Due to the harsh operating environment in DMFCs, it is still a great challenge to prepare a feasible catalyst that satisfies the stability requirement for MOR. With that in mind, the accelerated durability tests (ADT) of the Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G catalysts were further examined by a continuous potentiodynamic sweep between −0.96 and 0.24 V (vs. Hg/HgO). Fig. 4a and b display the MOR activities of the Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G catalysts before and after 2000 cycles of the potentiodynamic sweep test, respectively. The peak current density of the Pd/TaC-G after 2000 cycles was 1419 mA mgPd−1, only a 22.8% loss. While on the Pd/C electrode, only a current density of 248 mA mgPd−1 was observed after 2000 cycles, 58.5% loss of its initial MOR activity (Fig. 4c). These results indicate that the stability of the Pd/TaC-G is much better than that of Pd/C. Usually, the MOR activity degradation of Pd based catalysts was caused by the decrease in ECSA. Fig. S11† shows the CVs of Pd/C, Pd/G and Pd/TaC-G catalysts before and after the continuous cycling test. After calculation, the ECSA of the Pd/C decreased by about 42% and that of the Pd/G decreased by about 31%, while the Pd/TaC-G catalyst only showed a small loss and the calculated ECSA revealed only a loss of about 17%. The high durability of the Pd/TaC-G mainly stems from the effect of the support.

Based on above-mentioned results, it could be concluded that the MOR activity and stability of Pd/TaC-G are distinctly enhanced compared with Pd/C. According to previous reports, this kind of catalytic activity enhancement likely stems from the synergetic chemical coupling effect between noble metals and TMCs.25,54,55 In addition, this synergetic chemical coupling effect originates from the noble metals electronically interacting with TMCs that is correlated with the change of the noble metal surface d-band center.56 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study this electronically interaction between TaC-G and Pd. Fig. 5 compares the XPS spectra of the Pd 3d region for Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G. The XPS fitting curves show two series of peaks: the metallic Pd(0) at lower binding energies and Pd(II) at higher binding energies. The percentage of Pd(0) in Pd/TaC-G is 82.3%, which is higher than that of Pd/C (74.7%), suggesting more metallic Pd in Pd/TaC-G. It is clearly observed that the Pd 3d peaks of the Pd/TaC-G catalyst are shifted significantly to lower binding energies by 0.7 eV compared with Pd/C, indicating weakened 3d electron binding for Pd in the Pd/TaC-G. The weakened 3d electron binding of Pd in Pd/TaC-G likely results from the electronic interaction between Pd and TaC-G, through a partial electron transfer from TaC-G to Pd. The electron transfer would increase the electron density of Pd and enhance the penetration of outer-layer electrons to the inner layer, which changed binding energies and substantially enhanced the catalytic activity toward MOR.57
 Fig. 5  XPS spectra of the Pd 3d region for Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G. 
X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, a powerful technique that is widely applied in studying electronic and chemical structures of materials,58 has been used to study the synergistic chemical coupling effect between the noble metals and TMCs.36,45Fig. 6a shows the Pd K-edge of Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G together with a reference Pd foil sample. The XANES features of Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G are very similar to that of the Pd foil, and it is evident that the Pd in Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G exhibits a metallic character. The white line intensity of Pd/C is stronger than that of the Pd foil, which indicates the depletion of the d-charge of Pd atoms, caused by the transfer of charge to the oxygen atoms, since oxygen is more electronegative than palladium,59 which mainly comes from the passivation of the Pd nanoparticle surface by a thin PdO layer.60,61 Compared to Pd/C, a reversed decrease in the white line intensity was observed on Pd/TaC-G, which would be an indication of partial electron transfer from TaC-G to Pd, in agreement with the XPS analysis.
 Fig. 6  (a) Pd K-edge XANES of the Pd foil, Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G, (b and c) experimental and calculated EXAFS k-space spectra (k3-weighted) of Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G, and (d) k3-weighted Pd K-edge EXAFS Fourier transform magnitudes and first-shell fit of the Pd K-edge obtained from the Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G. 
After data analyses using the Artemis programme in the IFEFFIT software package, we fitted the Fourier transformation of the k-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) oscillations. Fig. 6b and c display the experimental and calculated EXAFS k-space spectra (k3-weighted) of Pd K-edge for Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G, respectively. The Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G have similar oscillation and similar node distances, indicating a similar structure. Fig. 6d shows the k·χ(k), from k space to R space over the range of 3.1–13.7 Å−1 that yields a radial distribution function and the corresponding fit to the experimental data. The EXAFS data gave the coordination number (CN) of Pd–Pd that represents the average number of Pd neighbours for each Pd atom. The CNs of Pd/C and Pd/TaC-G are 6.9 ± 0.29 and 5.7 ± 0.35, respectively, which are smaller than that of the Pd foil (CN = 12.2 ± 1.2) since the nanoscale size of the catalysts significantly increases the proportion of surface Pd sites. Except for the metallic Pd–Pd bonds, Pd–Ta bonds were observed in Pd/TaC-G with a CN of 0.7, which is attributed to the strong interactions between Pd and the TaC-G support and supposed to be the origin of the synergistic chemical coupling effect between the Pd and TaC-G nanosheets. The fitted parameters of the Pd/C, Pd/TaC-G and Pd foil are summarized in Table 1.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we developed a novel strategy to prepare a highly active and durable catalyst for MOR by optimizing the surface electronic structure of Pd nanoparticles through depositing onto TaC/RGO hybrid nanosheets. Compared to Pd/C, Pd/TaC-G reveals remarkable enhancement of catalytic activity for MOR in DMFCs. This activity enhancement can be explained by the synergetic chemical coupling between the Pd nanoparticles and TaC/RGO nanosheet hybrid, which is supported by the XPS, XANES and EXAFS analyses. This work established a synthesis route that can substitute platinum with palladium and enhance its resistance to poisonous intermediates and durability at the same time, providing a new approach to develop the next generation catalysts in DMFCs.
