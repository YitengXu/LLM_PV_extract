    , Accepted 28th January 2014First published on 28th January 2014AbstractThree porphyrin dyes, DPZn-HOQ, PZn-HOQ and DPZn-COOH, were synthesized and characterized for dye-sensitized solar cells. Both DPZn-HOQ and DPZn-COOH exhibited a donor–π–acceptor configuration with N,N-dimethylaniline as a donor and 8-hydroxylquinoline (HOQ) and para-benzoic acid (BZA) as acceptors, respectively. PZn-HOQ is an analogue of DPZn-HOQ without a donor. It was found that DPZn-HOQ exhibited broader and stronger light absorption capability in the red region than DPZn-COOH. Theoretical calculations showed that the electrons were delocalized to the 8-hydroxylquinoline ring in DPZN-HOQ. The DPZn-HOQ-sensitized solar cells exhibited higher energy conversion efficiency (3.09%) than DPZn-COOH-sensitized solar cells (1.76%) under the same conditions. The results were consistent with the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies revealed that HOQ-conjugated porphyrin exhibited high electron recombination resistance and a long electron lifetime, which was attributed to the effective shielding of DPZn-HOQ from the electrolyte due to its tilted orientation on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles. The efficiency of DPZn-HOQ-sensitized solar cells was further increased to 3.41% when a complementary dye BET was used.
1. Introduction
Low-cost and easy fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) make these types of devices very promising for future indoor and outdoor applications.1–3 Recently greater than 12% energy conversion efficiency has been achieved in a zinc porphyrin-sensitized solar cell in combination with a cobalt-based redox couple.4 However, low energy conversion efficiency and poor long-term stability are two major concerns in regard to its competitiveness with other types of solar cells.5 The concerns are linked tightly to the narrow absorption of sunlight and the weak adsorption strength of current dyes.5 One strategy to broaden the absorption spectra is to expand the π-conjugation. Ball et al.6 fused an anthracene into porphyrin and extended the absorption to 900 nm. However, the resulting solar cell only produced less than 0.1% energy conversion efficiency due to energetically unfavourable electron injection from its LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) to the conduction band of TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs). Reddy et al.7 found that conjugation of 4-carboxylanthracene to the porphyrin ring extended the absorption edge to 800 nm and resulted in an energy conversion efficiency of 8.21%. Therefore, it is critical to balance the energy level of frontier molecular orbitals and the bandgap of dyes in order to convert solar energy to electricity efficiently.
Dye molecules have to bind strongly on TiO2 nanoparticles without significant dissociation during the operation.5 This is usually achieved by coordination of a benzoic acid (BZA) group of dye molecules to titanium atoms of TiO2 nanoparticles.8 In the state-of-the-art DSC, a single BZA group was used to attach the porphyrin molecules to TiO2 nanoparticles.4,9 During the solar cell operation, the porphyrin dye molecule dissociates slowly from the TiO2 surface and eventually loses its ability to convert sunlight into electricity. Multiple BZA groups were introduced into porphyrin dyes in order to increase their binding capability.10–15 However, a compromise in solar cell efficiency was observed. Imahori et al.16 found that energy conversion efficiency decreased when a second BZA group was introduced into the porphyrin. Rochford et al.17 found that the introduction of four BZA groups into the porphyrin ring eliminated aggregation. Binding capability and electron injection were enhanced; however, this design limits further structural modifications. It is imperative to find a simple alternative anchoring group to replace the benzoic acid group (BZA) to address this concern.
Previously, He et al.18 found that 8-hydroxyquinoline (HOQ) could be an excellent candidate to replace the BZA group. The HOQ is an organic molecule with very strong binding capability to various metal ions including Ti atoms.19 It was found that HOQ-modified porphyrin dyes exhibited strong resistance toward acidic solution. The energy conversion efficiency was comparable to those that were sensitized by BZA-modified counterparts. To explore the potential of this finding in DSCs, we adopted a premium donor–π–acceptor configuration and conjugated the HOQ to the porphyrin ring through a triple bond as shown in Fig. 1. It was found that the new porphyrin dyes not only maintained the strong binding capability to TiO2 nanoparticles, but also exhibited up to 770 nm photon-to-electron response. In this report, synthesis, characterization, photophysical properties, and photovoltaic properties will be described. The theoretical calculations and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic investigation were also carried out to support observed phenomena.

2. Results and discussion
Design of dyes
Three dyes were designed for this study: DPZn-HOQ, PZn-HOQ and DPZn-COOH. The DPZn-HOQ featured a premium donor–π–acceptor configuration, in which N,N-dimethylaniline (D) and HOQ acted as a donor and an acceptor, respectively. Both were conjugated to the porphyrin ring through triple bonds. DPZn-COOH was designed as a reference. Its structure was quite similar to DPZn-HOQ except that benzoic acid (BZA) was used as an acceptor. PZn-HOQ was selected to evaluate the impact of the donor on the overall performance of the devices. It is expected that the HOQ group will not only maintain the strong binding capacity on the TiO2, but will also broaden the absorption spectrum due to its large π conjugation compared to the BZA group. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were first performed to provide some evidence to support these expectations. The geometry-optimized structures of three dyes and the electron density distribution profiles are shown in Fig. 2. In the geometry-optimized structure, the HOQ group was tilted by ∼45° to the porphyrin plane. The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO energy levels of DPZn-HOQ were, respectively, −4.78 eV and −2.63 eV, resulting in an energy gap of 2.15 eV. This energy gap was smaller (0.01 eV) than its counterpart DPZn-COOH. Its LUMO energy level was also higher than the conduction band of TiO2 NPs. As shown in Fig. 2, the electrons in the LUMO were delocalized from the porphyrin ring to the HOQ group, which would be beneficial to the electron injection. There is no clear disjoint between the donor and the acceptor. We also performed time-dependent DFT calculations. The predicted absorption spectrum is shown in Fig. 3. The DPZn-HOQ showed strong peaks at 450 nm and 665 nm with an absorption onset at around 800 nm. These results indicated the promise of HOQ-conjugated porphyrins for spectral broadening and adsorption enhancement for DSCs (Table 1).

Synthesis and characterization

Fig. 4 shows the synthetic procedure of three porphyrin dyes. The DPZn-HOQ was synthesized by a direct reaction of 5, 15-dibromo-10,20-dimesitylporphyrin zinc (Br-PZn-Br), one molar equivalent 4-ethynyl-N,N-dimethylaniline (D), and one molar equivalent 8-tert-butoxycarbonyloxy-5-ethynylquinoline (HQQ-Boc) in THF under typical Sonogashira coupling conditions.4,20 The reaction produced five compounds corresponding to replacement of one or two Br atoms by HOQ-Boc or D. The target compound was separated on column chromatography using chloroform and methanol as eluents, followed by removal of the protecting group Boc in chloroform in the presence of piperidine with an overall yield of ∼40%. The DPZn-HOQ was a green powder, soluble in chloroform, dichloromethane, methanol, ethanol, and THF and insoluble in hexane. The other two porphyrin dyes PZn-HOQ and DPZn-HOQ were prepared in a similar manner. The 1H NMR and MS confirmed the structure of these dyes.

Absorption spectra
The normalized absorption spectra of DPZn-HOQ, PZn-HOQ and DPZn-COOH in CHCl3 are shown in Fig. 5. The DPZn-HOQ exhibited two strong peaks at 461 and 672 nm, which matched the predicted spectrum very well. The peak at 672 nm was quite broad and intense. A shoulder between 550 and 650 nm was also observed. The DPZn-COOH exhibited one strong peak at 443 nm and three weak peaks at 575, 634 and 671 nm. The PZn-HOQ showed three peaks: 443, 568 and 622 nm.

As shown in Fig. 6, the overall absorption spectral features of porphyrin dyes on the TiO2 nanoparticles were quite similar to their solution spectra. However, an obvious red-shift of absorption peaks was observed for the DPZn-HOQ, indicating the strong electronic coupling between HOQ and TiO2 nanoparticles. A blue-shift was observed for PZn-HOQ. The Soret peak became quite broader indicating the existence of dye aggregation due to the lack of a donor group. The peak position of DPZn-COOH did not change too much. These results indicated that the desired absorption capability of the DPZn-HOQ for DSCs.

Photovoltaic studies
The photovoltaic performances of three porphyrin dyes were studied. A typical “sandwich” configuration of the DSC was adapted for this investigation. The dye-loading time was fixed to four hours as the efficiency decreased when the dye-loading time was increased. In these cells, the thickness of the TiO2 nanocrystalline layer was fixed to ∼7 μm. No scattering layer was applied. The results are listed in Table 2. The J–V curves are depicted in Fig. 7. The DPZn-HOQ gave 3.09% energy conversion efficiency, whereas DPZn-COOH only gave 1.76% energy conversion efficiency under the same conditions. Thus, the efficiency increased by 75% after the conventional benzoic acid group was replaced by HOQ. It was found that the open-circuit voltages (VOC) of DPZn-HOQ and DPZn-COOH sensitized cells were quite similar to each other (0.595 vs. 0.602 V), whereas the short-circuit current (JSC) was quite different (7.81 vs. 4.22 mA cm−2). We concluded that the increase of energy conversion efficiency of DPZn-HOQ-sensitized solar cells mainly came from the increase of JSC.

The energy conversion efficiency was consistent with the IPCE spectra as shown in Fig. 8. The DPZn-HOQ exhibited much broader and stronger photon-to-current response than DPZn-COOH in the red region, which was in agreement with their absorption spectra. It should be mentioned that the PZn-HOQ without a donor also exhibited better performance than DPZn-COOH (2.53% vs. 1.76%). Co-sensitization of DPZn-HOQ with the BET dye resulted in 10% increase of energy conversion efficiency, leading to an overall energy conversion efficiency of 3.41%. The enhancement was consistent with the strong complementary absorption of BET at around 510 nm, which may also occur through the Förster resonance energy transfer process.21–25

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
To explore whether the structural modification affected the electron recombination resistance in the devices, we performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)26–28 with an AC perturbation superimposed on the CW bias light illumination in the frequency range of 10−2–105 Hz. As shown in Fig. 9, the measured electron recombination resistance (Rct) of DPZn-HOQ at the TiO2 NP/electrolyte interface was about 6-fold larger than that of DPZn-COOH. The larger recombination resistance (or reduced recombination) could be attributed to the steric hindrance associated with the DPZn-HOQ adsorption geometry that presumably limits the accessibility of the oxidized species of the redox couple in the electrolyte from reaching the TiO2 NP surface. Consistent with the impedance result, the measured electron lifetime (τr) of a DPZn-HOQ sensitized solar cell was also much (about a factor of three) longer than that of the DPZn-COOH sensitized solar cell as shown in Fig. 10.

Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) showed that replacing the benzoic acid with HOQ did not show a significant impact on the electron diffusion coefficient (D) in the TiO2 matrix as shown in Fig. 11. However, introducing a donor increased the D values, which may come from an increased electric dipole moment (4.32 and 7.05 debyes for PZn-HOQ and DPZn-HOQ, respectively, from the calculation) for more effective electron diffusion from the top to the bottom of TiO2 NPs. Co-sensitization of DPZn-HOQ with the BET dye showed a negligible effect on electron transport.

The EIS results could be explained by a unique alignment of DPZn-HOQ on the TiO2 NP surface. DPZn-HOQ will chelate to TiO2 NPs in a bidentate mode, resulting in a non-vertical alignment as illustrated in Fig. 12. The mesityl groups, which are perpendicular to the porphyrin plane will likely stack over each other and form an effective layer to block the direct contact between the TiO2 surface and the electrolyte. As a result, the electron recombination will be significantly reduced. In contrast, the DPZn-COOH will chelate to Ti atoms vertically. The mesityl groups will not be able to stack over each other. There will be a large void between porphyrin dyes allowing the electrolyte to penetrate inside and come in contact directly with the TiO2 surface. To support this explanation, we measured the total amount of DPZn-HOQ and DPZn-COOH on a 0.16 cm2 TiO2 coated FTO glass. It was found that the amount of DPZn-HOQ was 31% higher than that of DPZn-COOH (12.37 × 10−9vs. 16.05 × 10−9 mol), which was very close to the estimated increase (33%) of volume of DPZn-COOH compared to DPZn-HOQ (assuming that porphyrins align as depicted in Fig. 12 and the distances of d1 and d2 are 15 and 20 Å, respectively).

We were unable to obtain reliable data to evaluate the long-term stability of the solar cells due to the leakage of the liquid electrolyte during the test. However, we tested the resistance of porphyrin-coated TiO2 film toward the base and the acid, which can be used as an indirect measure of long-term stability. When DPZn-COOH-coated film was immersed into 0.05 mM NaOH in ethanol–water (1:1) the dye de-adsorbed from TiO2 film completely within one hour, whereas only a slight color change was observed for DPZn-HOQ after three days. The optical images of these films are shown in Fig. 13. A similar resistance toward acid was also observed.

DPZn-C6-HOQ is an analogue of DPZn-HOQ with multiple alkyl groups. The study of this new dye is underway and the results will be reported in due course. 
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that conjugation of 8-hydroxylquinoline to the porphyrin ring through a triple bond not only broadened the absorption spectra with increased absorption coefficient, but also reduced the electron recombination at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The electron lifetimes were increased two times compared to the p-benzoic acid functionalized porphyrins. This resulted in a significant increase of energy conversion efficiency. Considering the versatile coupling capability of HOQ to many other organic dyes, this study demonstrated the potential of HOQ in DSC applications for high efficiency and excellent long-term stability.
4. Experimental
General methods and materials
All solvents were treated by standard methods prior to use. Chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received. The FTO (fluorine-tin-oxide) glass with a sheet resistance of 7 Ω cm−2 from Hartford Glass (USA) was used for cell fabrication. Absorption spectra were obtained on an HP Agilent 8543 UV-visible spectrophotometer in CHCl3 at room temperature. The steady-state fluorescence spectra were obtained on a fluorescence spectrometer (FS920, Edinburg Instruments Inc., UK) using a Xenon arc lamp as a light source. 5,10-dimesitylporphyrin zinc (PZn),29 5-bromo-10,20-dimesitylporphyrin zinc (PZn-Br), and 5,15-dibromo-10,20-dimesitylporphyrin (Br-PZn-Br) were prepared according to literature methods4 and confirmed by 1H NMR. 8-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-5-ethynylquinoline (HOQ-Boc) was prepared using a method as described by Montes et al.30 The complementary dye BET was prepared according to a method in our previous publication21,31 and its purity was confirmed by thin-layer-chromatography (TLC) and 1H NMR.

Fabrication of DSCs
Nanocrystalline TiO2 paste (Dyesol, 18 NR-T, ∼20 nm in diameter) was coated on a commercial fluorine-tin-oxide (FTO) using a doctor-blade method. After air-drying for about 30 minutes, the sample was put into an oven for sintering (500 °C for 30 min) in ambient oxygen. The sample was then cooled to room temperature, and a scattering layer (Dyesol, WER2-O, ∼400 nm in diameter) was coated again using a doctor-blade method. The sample was put into an oven for sintering (500 °C for 30 min) in ambient oxygen. The sample was then cooled to room temperature and was immersed in a TiCl4 aqueous solution (20 mM) for one hour. The film was air-dried and sintered again at 500 °C for 30 minutes. The film was then put into the dye solution (∼0.3 mM in methanol) at room temperature and kept for four hours. The film was then taken out, flushed with methanol, and vacuum dried for one hour. The thickness of the film was ∼17 μm as determined using a profilometer. The counter-electrode was prepared by sputtering a 16 nm-thick film of the Pt on the FTO glass. A mask made from the Parafilm was used as a spacer for two electrodes and a sealing material. The electrolyte solution was injected from two pre-drilled holes on a counter electrode. The cell was sealed by hot glue. The electrolyte is an acetonitrile solution having 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M guanidine thiocynate and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine.
Solar cell characterization
The applied potential and cell current were measured using an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer using a 450W Xenon light source. The light intensity at the surface of the cell was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2, equivalent to one sun under air mass 1.5G conditions. Efficiency (η) and the fill factor (ff) were calculated using η(%) = Pmax × 100/(Pin × A) and FF = Pmax/(ISC × VOC), where Pmax is the maximum output power of cells (mW), Pin is the power density of the light source (mW cm−2), Isc is the short-circuit current (mA), Voc is the open-circuit voltage (V), and A is the active area (0.16 cm2) of the cell. Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) experiments were performed on an Agilent semiconductor parameter analyzer using a Xe arc lamp and a Newport monochromator. Monochromatic light was incident on the sample through focusing lenses. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) calibrated photodetector was used as a reference. The samples were scanned from 350–850 nm and the voltage was recorded. The IPCE was calculated using the equation IPCE = (sample voltage × reference IPCE)/reference voltage. The reference IPCE was supplied by the NREL calibrated DSC under AM1.5 photon flux.
Theoretical calculations
Theoretical calculations were performed at the density functional theory level. The single-crystal structures of porphyrins were used as a framework for the construction of initial input structures of calculations. Geometry optimization and electronic structure calculations were performed using the B3LYP functional and the 6-31G(D) basis set in acetonitrile solution by means of the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM), a solvation model as implemented in the Gaussian 09 program package.32 The acetonitrile was used to mimic the solvents in the electrolyte. Molecular orbitals were visualized using GaussView 3.0. The method has been used widely for geometry optimization and electronic calculations of porphyrin derivatives for its accuracy.12,18,19,33–36
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Charge transport and recombination were studied, respectively, by intensity-modulated photocurrent (IMPS) and photovoltage (IMVS) spectroscopies as detailed previously.37–39 In brief, the cells were probed with a small sinusoidally modulated beam of 660 nm LED light superimposed on a relatively large background (bias) illumination also at 660 nm. The probe and bias light entered the cell from the substrate side. Neutral density filters were used to vary the illumination intensity. The amplitude of the modulated photocurrent density was kept at 10% or lower compared to the steady-state photocurrent density. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using a potentiostat/frequency analyzer (PARSTAT 2273) using a two-electrode configuration with the modulation frequencies ranging from 10−2 to 105 Hz and the modulation amplitude of 10 mV.
