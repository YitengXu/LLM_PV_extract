    , Accepted 29th July 2016First published on 29th July 2016AbstractThe electronic structures of highly active Ag-based oxide photocatalysts Ag3AsO4 and Ag3PO4 are studied by hybrid-density functional calculations. It is revealed that Ag3AsO4 and Ag3PO4 are indirect band gap semiconductors. The Hartree–Fock mixing parameters are fitted for experimental band gaps of Ag3AsO4 (1.88 eV) and Ag3PO4 (2.43 eV). The smaller electron effective mass and the lower valence band edge of Ag3AsO4 are likely to be responsible for the superior photocatalytic oxidation reaction to Ag3PO4. The comparable lattice constant and analogous crystal structure between the two materials allow the opportunities of fine-tuning the band gap of Ag3AsxP1−xO4 using a solid-solution approach. The development of Ag3AsxP1−xO4 should be promising for the discovery of novel visible-light sensitized photocatalysts.
1 Introduction
Much attention has been paid to photocatalysts based on oxide semiconductors for degrading organic contaminants as well as splitting water into H2 and O2. Since the discovery of the TiO2 photocatalyst, many efforts have been made to reduce its band gap (3.2 eV) because it can only absorb ultraviolet light and utilizes about 5% of solar energy. A widely adopted approach is doping with foreign elements, either cations or anions, for sensitizing TiO2 under visible light irradiation to increase the conversion efficiency of solar energy.1 However, doping is often accompanied by the formation of trapping centers of photoexcited carriers and degrades the quantum efficiency; the ratio of the number of photoexcited carriers that actually participate in the photocatalytic reaction to the number of photoexcited carriers that are initially produced by photons. Development and synthesis of visible-light-responsive photocatalysts such as AgAl1−xGaxO2,2 CdS,3 and BiVO44 is another approach to tackle the aforementioned problem. Recently, silver orthophosphate (Ag3PO4) was discovered to exhibit extremely high photocatalytic activity for O2 evolution from water, and its quantum efficiency is nearly 90% under visible light irradiation.5 This triggered several studies of the development of Ag3PO4 in various aspects such as facet engineering,6 external doping,7 and combining with other materials such as graphene.8 More recently, it has been reported that Ag3AsO4 exhibits higher photocatalytic activity than Ag3PO4 under visible-light irradiation.9 The narrow band gap of Ag3AsO4 (1.60–1.88 eV)9,10 and the potential of the valence band edge that is sufficiently positive (2.2 eV referenced to normal hydrogen electrode potential, NHE) were attributed to the high oxidation ability of photogenerated holes that participate in decomposing the organic pollutants. A question arises as to why Ag3AsO4 exhibits superior oxidation photocatalytic activity to Ag3PO4. Efforts have been made to understand the electronic and optical properties as well as the origin of high photocatalytic activity of Ag3PO411–13 and Ag3AsO4 under visible light.14 Only a recent work reported a comparative theoretical and experimental study of silver oxosalts, including Ag3PO4 and Ag3AsO4.10 The origin of the band gap difference and qualitative trends in the photocatalytic activity were discussed based on density functional theory calculations using a generalized gradient approximation (GGA).10 However, the band offset and the band gap engineering that are the prime keys for enhancing photocatalytic activities have not been discussed elsewhere.
Forming a solid solution of two semiconductors is a common approach toward band-gap engineering of photocatalysts. For example, an oxynitride (ZnO)x(GaN)1−x is known to split water into H2 and O2 under visible light irradiation.15 A recent study showed that AgAlO2 and AgGaO2 can form solid solutions, and photoabsorption edges and photocatalytic performance of AgAl1−xGaxO2 are controlled by its composition ratio.2
In this paper, we perform density-functional theory calculations using a screened hybrid-functional, which have been proven to reliably describe the electronic and structural properties of semiconductors.16 In contrast to the PBE0 hybrid-functional, an appropriate selection of the Hartree–Fock mixing parameter in the screened hybrid-functional allows ones to reproduce the values of experimental band gaps. Fundamental physical and electronic properties of Ag3AsO4 and Ag3PO4 are investigated and estimated; physical constants are in excellent agreement with the experimental values. The positions of the valence band and conduction band edges of the two materials relative to the vacuum level are obtained by the band alignment approach using the slab models. The results given by density-functional calculations are considerably different from those obtained by the Mulliken electronegativity approach. We also demonstrate that the band-gap engineering from the formation of the solid solution Ag3AsxP1−xO4 is a promising approach to enhance the performance of a visible-light responsive photocatalyst. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the investigation of the band gap engineering of Ag3AsxP1−xO4 alloys.
2 Computational methodology
The screened hybrid-functional proposed by Heyd, Scuceria, and Ernzerhof (HSE),17 as implemented in the VASP code,18,19 is employed to study the electronic structures of Ag3AsO4, Ag3PO4 and its alloys Ag3AsxP1−xO4. The energy cut-off of 520 eV is set for the plane-wave basis set expansion. The valence electron configurations of the projector augmented wave pseudopotentials are 4d105s1 for Ag, 3s23p3 for P, 4s24p3 for As, and 2s22p4 for O. In order to reproduce the experimental band gaps of Ag3AsO4 (1.88 eV) and Ag3PO4 (2.43 eV), the Hartree–Fock mixing parameter in the HSE approach of 31.5% and 33% was used, respectively. A set of 4 × 4 × 4 grid of Monkhorst–Pack special k-points is used for the Brillouin zone integrations. For the estimation of the band alignment of the two materials, the slab models with layers of non-polar terminated surfaces along the [001] direction containing 80 atoms were employed with the shifted 1 × 1 × 1 grid of Monkhorst–Pack special k-points. The empty region between the slabs is ∼30 Å to ensure that they will not interact with each other. All atoms are relaxed until the residual forces are less than 0.02 eV Å−1.
3 Results and discussion
Ag3AsO4 and Ag3PO4 have the cubic structure with space group P3n with 16 atoms in the primitive unit cell. The calculated lattice constants listed in Table 1 are in very good agreement with experimental values. The HSE functional is found to yield lattice constants of both materials closer to the experimental values than those obtained from LDA,20 PBE, and PBE011,14 functionals. The calculated local atomic structure of Ag3AsO4 is shown in Fig. 1. The primitive unit cell is composed of PO4 and AsO4 tetrahedra. We find that the As–O bonds (1.697 Å) are ∼10% longer than the P–O bonds (1.540 Å) in Ag3PO4 whereas the tetrahedral angles remain unchanged (∼110°). Bader charge analysis (Table 2) shows that the O atoms draws electrons from the P atom in Ag3PO4 nearly 0.31 electrons higher than O atoms in Ag3AsO4. By contrast, the Ag–O bond lengths in both Ag3AsO4 (2.397 Å) and Ag3PO4 (2.396 Å) are nearly identical while the Ag atoms in Ag3PO4 are more positive (+0.704e) compared to the Ag atoms in Ag3AsO4 (+0.685e). These results indicate that (Ag1+)3(PO4)3− is more ionic than (Ag1+)3(AsO4)3−. However, our calculated Ag–O bond lengths are different from that calculated by the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) of 2.344 Å (Ag3PO4) and 2.377 Å (Ag3AsO4) reported recently.10

Fig. 2 shows the calculated band structure of (a) Ag3AsO4 and (b) Ag3PO4 using the HSE functional. We find that both materials have an indirect band-gap with the valence band maximum (VBM) positions at the M point while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is at the Γ point in the Brillouin zone (see the inset of Fig. 2). It has been reported that Ag3PO4 is an indirect band gap semiconductor both experimentally5 and theoretically.11–13 The direct transition (Γ–Γ) and the indirect transition (M–Γ) are energetically very close to each other. In Ag3AsO4, the experimental band gap ranges from 1.60 eV9 to 1.88 eV.10 Jin et al.10 measured the band gaps of a series of silver oxosalts (Ag3AsO4, Ag3CO4, Ag3PO4, Ag3SO4 and Ag3SeO4) from diffuse reflectance UV spectra. However, transition gaps of a series of silver oxosalts did not verify whether Ag3AsO4 and Ag3PO4 were direct or indirect band gap materials. We found that the experimental gap of Ag3PO4 (2.46 eV) is in good agreement with the previously reported gap of the direct transition of Ag3PO4 (2.43 eV).5 Thus, we adopt the value of 1.88 eV from Jin et al.10 for the experimental direct transition of Ag3AsO4 which, we found, is reproduced by setting the HF mixing parameter to 31.5%. This scheme yields the indirect band gap of 1.75 eV. The energy difference between the direct and indirect band gaps is ∼0.13 eV, which is identical to that of Ag3PO4 (Table 1). Note that the PBE0 functional used in ref. 14 yielded the direct band-gap of ∼1.80 eV while the GGA functional adopted in ref. 10 predicted Ag3AsO4 to be a metal.10,14 This indicates that GGA or other local functionals cannot reproduce a semiconductor electronic structure even qualitatively for Ag3AsO4. In principle, the curvatures of the top of the valence band and bottom of the conduction band determine the hole and electron effective masses, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the energy difference between the lowest conduction-band states at Γ and M, ΔCΓ–M, is ∼2.46 eV for Ag3PO4 and ∼2.77 eV for Ag3AsO4, implying the lower electron effective mass and thus higher electron mobility in Ag3AsO4. This statement is evidenced by our calculated electron effective masses of both Ag3PO4 and Ag3AsO4, which can be expressed as: (1)where, E is the band-edge energy near the conduction band minimum as a function of wave-vector k. The electron effective mass is calculated by parabolic fitting the E–k curve within the small region of wave-vector near the CBM. The hole effective mass can be estimated using a similar approach. Table 3 shows the calculated electron and hole effective masses of both materials based on the HSE functional. It was argued that the high electron mobility is an origin of the high photocatalytic activity in Ag3PO4.12 The origin of the lower electron effective mass or in other words the higher dispersion of the conduction band edge in Ag3AsO4 can be attributed to the more prominent As character in the conduction band. The density of states for Ag3PO4 and Ag3AsO4 are shown in Fig. 3a and b. It is clear that the As character in Ag3AsO4 is more pronounced than the P character in Ag3PO4 at the CBM. This is understood from the bond diagram shown in Fig. 3c, i.e., the shallower As 4p states result in weaker As 4p-O 2p bonding–antibonding splitting, allowing the As states coincide with the CBM. The weaker As–O bond leads to the longer As–O bond length of 1.69 Å compared to the P–O bond length of 1.54 Å. Our calculated charge distributions at the CBM show a clear contribution from As atoms in Ag3AsO4 while the contribution from P atoms is nearly negligible in Ag3PO4 (see the ESI†). It is, therefore, considered that the lower lying As 4p-O 2p antibonding states are readily hybridized with Ag 5s, resulting in the higher dispersion of the CBM and thus lower electron effective mass. Obviously, this also affects the smaller band gap of Ag3AsO4. On the other hand, the origin of different hole effective masses of the two materials can be understood as follows. Bader charge analysis (Table 2) shows that the O atoms in Ag3PO4 possess more electrons (−1.487e) than in Ag3AsO4 (−1.175e), suggesting a promotion of O 2p-Ag 4d hybridization in Ag3PO4. The partial charge distribution of the VBM (M point) shows higher distribution from Ag 4d orbitals in Ag3PO4, confirming stronger O 2p-Ag 4d hybridization (see the ESI†). We believe that this is the cause of the higher dispersion of the VBM and smaller hole effective mass of Ag3PO4.

In addition to the appropriate band gap values, suitable band edge positions are also vital for a desired visible-light responsive photocatalyst. In order to explain the redox ability in Ag3AsO4 and Ag3PO4 under visible-light irradiation, the band edge positions referenced to the NHE scale have been calculated. Here, we adopted (1) the Mulliken electronegativity approach and (2) the first-principles band alignment relative to a vacuum level approach to estimate the position of the band edges. The comparison between the two methods is discussed to analyze the redox ability.
The position of the VB and CB edges according to the Mulliken electronegativity approach23 can be calculated as ECB = χ − Ee − 0.5Eg and EVB = ECB + Eg, where EVB and ECB are the VB and CB edge potentials, respectively, and Eg is the band gap at Γ. χ is the Mulliken electronegativity of Ag3AsO4 and Ag3PO4, which is calculated to be about 5.92 eV and 5.96 eV, respectively, based on electron affinities and atomic ionization energies taken from ref. 24. Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (∼4.5 eV) and Eg is the band gap from our HSE functional approach. The band edge position calculated from Mulliken electronegativity is shown in Fig. 4. The valence band edge potentials (vs. NHE) are +2.23 eV for Ag3AsO4 and +2.59 eV for Ag3PO4 (+2.35 eV for Ag3AsO4 and +2.67 eV for Ag3PO4 if direct band gap values were used for Eg), which are close to those reported in the recent theoretical works (+2.26 for Ag3AsO414 and +2.67 eV for Ag3PO411). These values of the valence band edge potentials for Ag3AsO4 and Ag3PO4 are sufficiently positive with respect to the oxidation potential of water (+1.23 eV vs. NHE) and suggest both materials are active for photocatalytic O2 production.
 Fig. 4  Calculated valence and conduction band edge positions of Ag3AsO4 and Ag3PO4 obtained from the Mulliken electronegativity approach (left panel) and the first-principles band alignment approach (right panel) on the absolute energy scale (left vertical axis) and on the natural hydrogen electrode potential scale (right vertical axis). The horizontally aligned numbers are the band edge positions on the NHE scale. The corresponding band gaps (indirect) are also shown. 
For the band alignment calculations using the slab model, we employed layers of non-polar terminated surfaces along the [001] direction in a vacuum region of ∼30 Å. This approach has proven to be practical and widely accepted for the calculations of the band offsets in oxide and nitride semiconductors.24 The band edge positions relative to the vacuum level are calculated by the following procedures. (1) the energy difference between the vacuum level (Vvac) and Vae is calculated to be ΔVslab = Vvac − Vae, where Vae is the average electrostatic potential in the bulk region of the slab. (2) The energy difference between the valence band edge positions, EVB and Vae, in the bulk unit cell is determined to be ΔVbulk = EVB − Vae. We thus can estimate the valence band edge position as EVB = ΔVbulk − ΔVslab. The ionization potentials (the valence band edge positions with respect to the vacuum level) obtained from these procedures for Ag3AsO4 and Ag3PO4 are depicted in the right panel of Fig. 4, which are −7.20 eV and −7.03 eV, respectively. The higher position of the Ag3PO4 valence band edge can be attributed to the higher dispersion of the top of the valence band, consistent with the calculated smaller hole effective mass.
In order to explain the discrepancy of the band edge positions between the two approaches, we need to understand the concepts beneath the Mulliken method and DFT-based method. The Mulliken method is based on chemical composition and cannot consider the effects of bonding and crystal structure. All polymorphs with the same chemical composition have an equivalent band alignment position. A. Walsh et al.25 showed that in some semiconductors such as ZnO, In2O3 GaN and TiO2, the ionization potential estimated from the Mulliken model is less accurate than that from first-principles calculations; typically its error is in order of 0.5 eV. In our case, the band edge alignment calculations based on density-functional calculations are more advantageous because the Mulliken model fails to describe the bonding of metal d-orbitals.25 Our calculated band edge positions based on density functional theory predict that Ag3AsO4 possesses a lower valence band edge, and thus a stronger oxidation power than Ag3PO4. This should be one of the reasons for the observed higher activity for rhodamine degradation on Ag3AsO4.9
Now, we turn our attention to elucidate the effects of the mixing Ag3AsO4 with Ag3PO4 to form solid solutions Ag3AsxP1−xO4 on their band gaps. The modified Ag3AsxP1−xO4 solid-solutions were calculated using a 32-atom supercell and 16-atom unit cell (which is the primitive cell). As examples, replacing one out of four phosphorus atoms with an arsenic atom in the 32-atom supercell corresponds to the concentration of 25% As (Ag3As0.25P0.75O4). For the 16-atom unit cell, replacing one phosphorus with an arsenic atom corresponds to the concentration of 50% As (Ag3As0.50P0.50O4). In this work, we modeled ordered alloys corresponding to the concentration of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% As. The lattice parameters and atomic positions were allowed to fully relax. The Hartree–Fock mixing parameter in the HSE approach Ag3AsxP1−xO4 is linearly interpolated in order to reproduce the correct indirect band gaps for both limiting materials. The variation of the indirect band gap as a function of the composition x in Ag3AsxP1−xO4 is shown in Fig. 5. We found that the band gap of Ag3AsxP1−xO4 is nonlinear and can be expressed as24 (2)where b is the bowing parameter. In our calculation, we found that the value of the bowing parameter is 0.174. The curvature correction that is characterized by the bowing parameter b in our calculation is rather small, indicating that the band gap of Ag3AsxP1−xO4 is close to linear. Note that the bowing parameter for the linear equation is equal to zero. Fig. 5 shows the decrease of the band gap when the arsenic concentration increases. Based on our thermodynamic investigation, we also found that the formation of solid solutions is feasible at temperatures of interest. The estimated free energies of mixing yield negative values at temperatures higher than 400 K (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The decrease of the band gap with the increase in the As content in Ag3AsxP1−xO4 is the consequence of the hybridization of multiple states at the CBM. As discussed earlier, the near band-edge hybridizations of As 4p (or P 3p)–O 2p antibonding states with Ag 5s orbitals result in the higher dispersion of the CBM and narrower band gap of Ag3AsO4 compared to Ag3PO4. Hence, we believe that the different conduction band dispersion in the different As contents is the origin of the band gap variation in Ag3AsxP1−xO4. There should be other factors that affect the band gap such as the position of the bonding states involving the As–O and P–O hybridization that possibly influences the valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum.

4 Conclusion
In summary, based on the screened hybrid-density functional calculations, we investigated the electronic properties and band offset of Ag3PO4 and Ag3AsO4. The experimental lattice constants are well reproduced. We found that the origin of the high visible-light photocatalytic activity of Ag3AsO4 is attributed not only to its low energy gap, but also its low valence band edge position (more positive on the NHE scale). In addition, we offer an opportunity to modify the band gap of Ag3AsO4 through the Ag3AsxP1−xO4 solid-solutions. Our calculations showed that its band gap can be linearly fine-tuned by varying the As composition. This work not only present the fundamental understanding of the electronic properties of these two important visible-light responsive photocatalysts, but also sheds light on band-gap engineering of silver oxosalts.

 	Fig. 3  Projected density of states (PDOS) on each atomic specie in (a) Ag3PO4 and (b) Ag3AsO4. The shaded areas indicate the PDOS on P and As atoms. The valence band maximum is set at 0 eV and the smearing factor is selectively set for clarity. (c) Schematic diagram for As–O and P–O bonding. Only the interactions between the p states are shown.	 

 	Fig. 4  Calculated valence and conduction band edge positions of Ag3AsO4 and Ag3PO4 obtained from the Mulliken electronegativity approach (left panel) and the first-principles band alignment approach (right panel) on the absolute energy scale (left vertical axis) and on the natural hydrogen electrode potential scale (right vertical axis). The horizontally aligned numbers are the band edge positions on the NHE scale. The corresponding band gaps (indirect) are also shown.
