    , Accepted 29th October 2022First published on 31st October 2022AbstractFe-based oxides are considered as promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high theoretical capacities, low cost, natural abundance and environmental friendliness. However, their severe volume expansion upon cycling and poor conductivity limit their cycling stability and rate capability. To address this issue, a hybrid of Fe2O3 nanoparticles encapsulated at the endpoints of nitrogen-doped CNTs (Fe2O3@NCNTs) is designed and prepared using a metal-catalyzed graphitization–nitridization driven tip-growth process and subsequent oxidation in air. When evaluated as an anode material for LIBs, this Fe2O3@NCNT hybrid exhibits a high capacity of 1145 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, excellent rate capability of 907 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 and remarkable cycling stability of 856 mA h g−1 after 800 cycles at 1 A g−1, which are much superior to those of the Fe2O3/carbon black (CB) control material. The outstanding electrochemical performance benefits from the unique nanoarchitecture of Fe2O3@NCNTs, which provides a porous conductive matrix for effective electron–ion transport, and provides space confining carbon nanocaps as well as stress buffer nanocavities for robust structural stability during the lithiation/delithiation process. The results may pave the way for the rational structural design of high-performance metal oxide-based anode materials for next-generation LIBs.
The ever-increasing fossil fuel burning, carbon dioxide emission and climate change are driving the development of renewable energy generation (e.g., solar, wind, tidal and geothermal) and electrical energy storage technologies.1 As successful commercial products, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with the merits of high energy density, long service life, environmental friendliness and absence of a memory effect have been widely used in portable electronic devices for the last few decades, and have now become popular in the applications of renewable energy storage and electric vehicle power sources.2,3 It is well known that a key reaction in LIBs to produce electrical energy is the reversible insertion and extraction of Li+ from the anode material, accompanying the addition and removal of electrons. To meet the ever-increasing demands of high energy density, long working life and good safety of high power LIBs in their applications of electric vehicle batteries and large scale energy storage, developing advanced anode electrodes based on durable, low cost and environmentally benign materials with higher energy density than that of conventional graphite has become an urgent topic.4–6
The conversion-type transition metal oxides, especially Fe-based materials (Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, etc.), which have many advantages such as a high theoretical capacity (ca. 1000 mA h g−1), low cost, nontoxicity and abundance, are some of the most promising candidates for the replacement of a carbon anode.7–9 Besides, the use of high-voltage cathodes (such as LixMnyNi2−yO4) and a spinel-type structure can offset the higher work voltage of Fe-based materials compared to conventional graphite and enable their large-scale application in practical full Li-ion cells. However, this intriguing class of semiconductor materials intrinsically suffer from poor electrical conductivity, large volume change (>200%) and severe electrode pulverization during Li+ insertion/extraction cycling, thus leading to low reversible capacity and rate performance.10 Recently, various strategies have been developed to improve the electrochemical performances of transition-metal oxides, such as structural amelioration (e.g. monophasic and polyphasic synthesis),11 crystallinity modulation (single crystal, polycrystal or amorphism),12,13 defect engineering (surface and crystal heteroatom doping),14–16 composition modification (hybridization with carbon or metal, changing the element valence, or reducing the inserted Li content),17–19 morphological control (zero-, one-, two-, and three-dimensional structures, nanostructuring, porosity, structural hierarchy, and surface and interface regulation)20–22 and so forth. These strategies inspired us to rationally design and synthesize an anode material system with a unique structure and morphology to enhance the electrochemical performance.
Recently, increasing research has focused on hybridizing transition metal oxide nanoparticles into a porous graphitic carbon skeleton (MxOy@C) because the carbon matrix with interspaces can increase electronic conductivity, accelerate ion diffusion, reduce particle size and buffer volume expansion.17,23,24 In addition, the core–shell structured MxOy@C can prevent direct contact between the active nanoparticles and electrolyte, thus inhibiting the repeated decomposition and formation of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) films.18,25,26 The filling of metal oxide nanoparticles into the hollow cores of CNTs by methods such as the capillary effect of the CNT channels, aluminium anodic oxide (AAO) templating, arc discharge, CVD or atomic layer deposition to control their structure and morphology can not only improve the conductivity but also better buffer the volume expansion of MxOy electrode materials.27–30 However, these methods have the drawbacks of inhomogeneous product distributions, low electrical conductivity of the as-prepared amorphous CNTs, high energy-consumption, low yields and high cost, respectively. Furthermore, it is difficult to synergistically prepare transition metal oxide nanoparticles and highly graphitized nanocarbon by nanocasting (hard template method, e.g. AAO) using traditional organic carbon sources such as sucrose, glucose, citric acid or phenolic resins etc. because the formation of highly graphitized nanocarbon materials with ultrahigh electrical conductivity such as acetylene black, graphene, fullerene etc. requires a heating temperature above 2500 °C. Besides, most metal oxides will be reduced to metals by carbon at such a high temperature of 2500 °C and melt, agglomerate, and solidify into millimeter-sized particles upon heating and cooling.31,32 Therefore, it is very challenging and highly desirable to develop a simple and low-temperature method for the in situ synthesis of highly graphitic nanocarbon embedded with metal oxide nanoparticles, and the related reports are pretty rare.
In this pioneering study, the pivotal one-dimensional (1-D) nanostructure, nitrogen doped CNTs (NCNTs) encapsulating foreign iron carbide nanoparticles (Fe3C@NCNTs) has been initially prepared at 700 °C based on a metal-catalyzed graphitization–nitridization driven tip-growth process. Fe3C@NCNTs were further oxidized into iron oxide nanoparticles encapsulated in NCNTs (Fe2O3@NCNTs) with a controlled structure in air at 300 °C. The as-prepared Fe2O3@NCNTs were applied as an anodic material in LIBs, and it showed high electrical conductivity and structural stability during cycling. The device assembled with the anodic Fe2O3@NCNTs delivered a high reversible capacity of 1145 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and exhibited outstanding rate and cycling performance. This facile and efficient in situ synthesis strategy will open a pathway for the exploration of new chemistry, electrochemistry and related mechanisms within a confined one-dimensional nanotube.
A schematic illustration of the in situ synthesis of the Fe2O3@NCNT sample is shown in Fig. 1. The Fe3C@NCNT composite was firstly prepared by a metal-catalyzed graphitization and nitridation reaction using C3N4 as a solid carbon and nitrogen source along with FeC2O4·2H2O as the metal source and self-generated catalyst via calcination at 700 °C in a N2 atmosphere (Fig. S1, ESI†). The resulting sample was then heated in air at 300 °C to oxidize the Fe3C nanoparticles into Fe2O3 nanoparticles, yielding the Fe2O3 encapsulated NCNT hybrid for use as an anode of LIBs. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Fe2O3@NCNTs in Fig. 2a shows a diffraction peak located at a 2θ value of 26.5°, which can be attributed to the (002) lattice planes of graphite (PDF#65-6212). The rest of the peaks arise from the diffraction of the planes of hematite (α-Fe2O3, PDF#33-0664). These results prove that the synthesized hybrid is made of Fe2O3 and carbon. The appropriate oxidization temperature was screened by TG-DSC analysis, as shown in Fig. 2b. The weight increase starting at 293 °C originates from the oxidization of embedded Fe3C into Fe2O3 and the weight decrease starting at 459 °C originates from the heavier oxidization of NCNTs into CO2. The exothermic peak at 506 °C stems from the oxidization of bulk Fe3C and NCNTs. It can be seen that the post-oxidization temperature should be regulated to 293–459 °C for oxidizing the embedded Fe3C nanoparticles while avoiding combustion of the corresponding coating carbon nanocaps. So, we set the oxidation temperature to 300 °C.

The morphology and structure of the obtained hybrid were investigated by using SEM and TEM. The SEM images of Fe2O3@NCNTs in Fig. 3a and b show that a large number of NCNTs are intertwined into a three-dimensional microclew, forming abundant nanovoids and nanocavities. The NCNTs possess bright podiform endpoints, a tubular diameter of ca. 50–80 nm and length of several hundred nanometers. Monodispersed nanoparticles with a particle size of ca. 40 nm are homogeneously embedded at the endpoints of the NCNTs (Fig. 3c and d). The measured lattice spacing of the embedded nanoparticles was 0.37 nm, which can be assigned to the (012) crystal planes of Fe2O3 (Fig. 3e). The result indicated that the Fe2O3 nanoparticles were completely encapsulated in the NCNTs. The TEM image in Fig. 3f and TEM elemental mapping of Fe2O3@NCNTs in Fig. 3g–i reveal that the Fe, O and C elements are homogeneously distributed at the endpoints of the NCNTs, demonstrating the successful oxidation of Fe3C into Fe2O3 while maintaining the integrity of the NCNTs.

The surface composition and chemical states of the Fe2O3@NCNT nanocomposite were characterized by using XPS measurements. In the high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum, the peaks at binding energies of 710.6 (2p3/2)/724.1 (2p1/2) and 712.7 (2p3/2)/726.6 (2p1/2) eV as well as two prominent shake-up satellite peaks at 718.9 (2p3/2) and 732.9 (2p1/2) eV correspond to Fe(II) and Fe(III) in Fe2O3, respectively (Fig. 4a).15 It was noticed that Fe2+ also existed in the sample, which may be attributed to the considerable number of defect sites with low oxygen coordination bonds. Based on the different electronic states of N heteroatoms, the deconvoluted N 1s high-resolution spectrum contains peaks at 404.3 401.7, 400.9 and 398.7 eV representing four N species, which can be assigned as pyridinic oxide (16%), graphitic-N (21%), pyrrolic-N (25%) and pyridinic-N (38%), respectively (Fig. 4b).17 The relative surface concentration of carbon and nitrogen was obtained from the full XPS survey of Fe2O3@NCNT shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), and the C/N atomic ratio was evaluated to be 15, demonstrating the highly nitrogen doped nature of the carbon structure. Generally, the lone pair electrons in pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N atoms can share a p electron with the aromatic π-conjugated carbon ring, yielding a negatively charged carbon wall, which can enhance the adsorption ability of NCNTs toward Li+.

The structural characteristics of the Fe2O3@NCNT sample were detected using the Raman spectrum shown in Fig. 4c. The sharp peaks of the Fe2O3@NCNT hybrid at 1348 and 1579 cm−1 are ascribed to the characteristic D band of defects in amorphous carbon (the defect density is the highest at the endpoints of the NCNTs) and G band of graphitic carbon, respectively.33 The intensity ratio of D-band to G-band is proportional to the density of the defects and number of graphitic sites. The ratio of the integrated intensity (ID/IG) for the NCNTs in Fe2O3@NCNTs is ca. 0.85, indicating the combination of a highly graphitic carbon wall and the defect enriched graphitic carbon nanocaps. The metallic conductivity of the NCNTs was also verified by using the UV-visible-IR spectrum, which displays an obvious peak at 516 nm (Fig. S3, ESI†).34
N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were recorded to examine the porous structure of the Fe2O3@NCNT hybrid. As shown in Fig. 4d, a type IV isotherm with a H3 hysteresis loop at P/P0 = 0.4–1.0 was observed, indicating the presence of disordered mesopore channels.9 The hollow cores of the NCNTs and inter-connective void spaces in the twisting NCNTs account for the formation of the porous system. The BET surface area of Fe2O3@NCNTs was estimated to be 85.2 m2 g−1. Thus, the interconnected porous structure in Fe2O3@NCNTs and the structural defects at the endpoints of the NCNTs could ensure rapid electrolyte diffusion to the surface of the metal oxides. The results of the N2 adsorption/desorption and Raman tests also revealed that the porous structure and topologic defects obtained by metal-catalyzed graphitization and nitridization allow the penetration of oxygen through the NCNT nanocaps to react with the Fe3C nanoparticles, forming Fe2O3 nanoparticles encapsulated at the endpoints of the NCNTs.
Cyclic voltammetry analysis was used to examine the electrochemical properties of Fe2O3@NCNTs as a LIB anode at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 (0.01–3 V). In the first discharge curve, a sharp reduction peak appeared at 0.63 V, corresponding to the electrochemical reduction (lithiation) of Fe2O3 to metallic Fe (Fe2O3 + 6Li+ + 6e− ↔ 3Li2O + 2Fe) and the accompanying formation of the SEI film (Fig. 5a).35 The broad anodic peak at 1.74 V relates to the oxidation (delithiation) of metallic Fe to Fe2O3 (2Fe + 3Li2O ↔ Fe2O3 + 6Li+ + 6e−). In the second cycle, the intensities of the cathodic and anodic peaks were reduced substantially and the electrical displacement was transferred to a higher value of 0.95 and 1.86 V, respectively. This changing trend is due to acute volume and structure modification, and irreversible transformation of reactants within the electrode after the first Li+ insertion and extraction cycle. The peak intensity and integral area of the fifth cycle are basically the same as those of the third cycle, indicating excellent electrochemical reversibility during the charge and discharge process.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out to understand the electroactivity of Fe2O3@NCNTs. Nyquist impedance plots were measured after 3 cycles at 100 mA g−1 (0.1 C) in the fully charged state (Fig. 5b). According to the equivalent circuit diagram shown in the inset in Fig. 5b, the high frequency intercept, medium frequency semicircle and low frequency Warburg straight line in the curve represent the series resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the Li+ diffusion behavior, respectively.36 The simulated Rs value of the Fe2O3@NCNT electrode (2.8 Ω) is quite a lot smaller than the corresponding value of Fe2O3/CB (4.6 Ω), indicating that the metallic NCNT substrate significantly improved the electronic conductivity of Fe2O3. Importantly, Fe2O3@NCNTs show an Rct of 148.2 Ω while Fe2O3/CB exhibits a much larger Rct of 223.8 Ω, verifying the enhanced charge transfer and Li+ diffusion processes in Fe2O3@NCNTs.

Fig. 5c shows the typical galvanostatic charge/discharge voltage profiles of Fe2O3@NCNTs at a current density of 100 mA g−1 between 0.01 and 3 V. During the first discharge, a potential plateau around 0.7 V is established. It moves to 0.95 V and remains stable in the subsequent cycles. Meanwhile, the charging phase exhibited two stable plateaus between 1.3 and 1.9 V, which match the CV curves well. After several charge/discharge cycles, the voltage hysteresis became stable with overlapped voltage plateaus at 0.95 and 1.9 V, which is ascribed to the reversible conversion reaction. In the first cycle, the charge and discharge specific capacities of Fe2O3@NCNTs are 1195 and 1510 mA h g−1, respectively, corresponding to a coulomb efficiency (CE) of 79.1%, much better than those of Fe2O3/CB (1328, 848 mA h g−1, 63.9%) and previously reported CEs.25,37 The enhanced initial CE can be attributed to the large specific surface area with reduced surface side effects, benefiting from the well-dispersed Fe2O3 nanoparticles confined in the carbon nanocaps of the NCNTs. The rate performance of the Fe2O3@NCNT and Fe2O3/CB electrodes was measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 5d. It can be seen that a stable high discharge capacity of 1145, 1075, 1035, 982 and 907 mA h g−1 in the 30th-cycle at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1 was successively achieved for Fe2O3@NCNTs. The capacity of the Fe2O3@NCNT electrode can be recovered to 1066 mA h g−1 when the current density returns back to 0.1 A g−1, which shows the excellent rate capability of the Fe2O3@NCNT electrode. However, the Fe2O3/CB electrode exhibits much faster capacity fading from 750 to 665, 549, 431 and 296 mA h g−1 as the current density increases from 0.1 to 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 C, respectively, indicating a poor rate capability. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 5e, the Fe2O3@NCNT electrode displays an impressive cycle stability, reaching 1043 mA h g−1 at the 2nd cycle, 856 mA h g−1 at the 800th cycle and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98%, which is superior to those of Fe2O3/CB (603 mA h g−1, 195 mA h g−1, and 99.93%) and previously reported carbon coated Fe2O3 microparticles (Table S1, ESI†).23,37,38 The morphological structure of the Fe2O3@NCNT electrode before and after 800 discharge–charge tests was also investigated using SEM (Fig. S5, ESI†). It was found that intact Fe2O3 nanoparticles with a doubled swollen volume compared to that of the pristine ones were still intimately linked to the NCNTs. The observation verified that the confinement of Fe2O3 nanoparticles in flexible and retractable one-dimensional NCNTs successfully kept the integrity of the electrode by buffering the volume changes and stress-induced fracturing of Fe2O3, allowing the formation of the SEI film in the initial cycles and reaching a steady status over extended numbers of cycles.
The outstanding rate and cycling performances of Fe2O3@NCNTs can be attributed to its superior structural and morphological characteristics. First, the highly crystallized NCNT backbone can form an electrically conductive porous network to improve the electronic–ionic transport of the anode. Second, the ca. 40 nm sized Fe2O3 nanoparticles encapsulated in the endpoints of the NCNTs shortened the electronic–ionic transport distance and exhibited reduced aggregation. Third, the very thin, N-doped and defect enriched carbon nanocaps facilitate the adsorption and penetration of Li+ to the embedded Fe2O3 nanoparticles. Fourth, the nanoparticle size and NCNT confinement effects restrain the volume expansion/contraction of Fe2O3 during the charge/discharge processes, which prevents the exfoliation of active materials from the conductive NCNT substrate and the loss of electrical contact with the Cu current collector. Therefore, the superior electrochemical properties of Fe2O3@NCNTs benefit from its unique structural and morphological characteristics.
In conclusion, we have successfully prepared a hybrid of iron oxide nanoparticles encapsulated at the endpoints of nitrogen-doped CNTs by a novel metal-catalyzed graphitization–nitridization driven tip-growth process and following air oxidation reaction. With a remarkable 1-D electrical conductivity, abundant carbon nanocap covered Fe2O3 nanoparticle active sites, highly porous nature and preeminent structural stability, Fe2O3@NCNTs were applied as anodes for LIBs, which displayed a large capacity of 1145 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C after 30 cycles, high-rate capability of 907 mA h g−1 at 5 C after 30 cycles and a superior long term cycling stability of 856 mA h g−1 after 800 cycles at 1 C. We believe that NCNTs embedded with other metal oxides, sulfides, or phosphides (e.g., Co3O4, FexSy, or FexPy) could also withstand the mechanical strain resulting from lithiation/delithiation processes, improve conductivity and achieve excellent cycling stability and high-rate capability for high power LIBs, and have certain industrialization prospects.
