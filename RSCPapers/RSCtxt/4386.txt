    First published on 21st August 2012AbstractThe nitrate radical, NO3, is photochemically unstable but is one of the most chemically important species in the nocturnal atmosphere. It is accompanied by the presence of dinitrogen pentoxide, N2O5, with which it is in rapid thermal equilibrium at lower tropospheric temperatures. These two nitrogen oxides participate in numerous atmospheric chemical systems. NO3 reactions with VOCs and organic sulphur species are important, or in some cases even dominant, oxidation pathways, impacting the budgets of these species and their degradation products. These oxidative reactions, together with the ozonolysis of alkenes, are also responsible for the nighttime production and cycling of OH and peroxy (HO2 + RO2) radicals. In addition, reactions of NO3 with biogenic hydrocarbons are particularly efficient and are responsible for the production of organic nitrates and secondary organic aerosol. Heterogeneous chemistry of N2O5 is one of the major processes responsible for the atmospheric removal of nitrogen oxides as well as the cycling of halogen species though the production of nitryl chloride, ClNO2. The chemistry of NO3 and N2O5 is also important to the regulation of both tropospheric and stratospheric ozone. Here we review the essential features of this atmospheric chemistry, along with field observations of NO3, N2O5, nighttime peroxy and OH radicals, and related compounds. This review builds on existing reviews of this chemistry, and encompasses field, laboratory and modelling work spanning more than three decades.

1. Introduction
Atmospheric chemistry has long been associated with daytime phenomena such as the formation of ozone and secondary aerosol. The discovery of the nitrate radical in the nocturnal troposphere1,2 and stratosphere3,4 and early reports of the presence of non-negligible concentrations of nocturnal OH, HO2, and RO2 radicals5–8 clearly showed that active chemistry was also occurring at night. Nevertheless, nocturnal processes were perceived to be less important, due to the low levels of OH and the generally slower chemistry of NO3. After initial studies of urban NO3 chemistry in Los Angeles2,9–11 in the early 1980s, no field observation of nighttime NO3 radicals in urban areas were published for nearly two decades, and observations in marine, rural and forested areas were sparse. The discovery of the ozone hole sparked interested in stratospheric NO3,12,13 which ebbed at the beginning of the 1990s.
Only in the past decade was it recognized that nocturnal radical chemistry of NO3 and related species such as N2O5, and other nocturnal radicals can indeed have a much more noticeable effect than previously assumed. Part of this renewed interest in nocturnal radical chemistry stems from new observational techniques, the realization that nocturnal processes can considerably influence photochemistry during the next day, and a refined understanding of the role of heterogeneous processes occurring at night. For the purpose of this review, we define the term heterogeneous to mean reaction between a gas phase and particulate phase constituent, regardless of the phase of the particle (i.e., liquid vs. solid) or whether the reaction occurs on the particle surface or within the bulk.14,15
Nocturnal radical chemistry, and in particular that of NO3 and N2O5, impact a number of key atmospheric phenomena (Fig. 1):
Nocturnal radicals react with a number of hydrocarbons thus impacting their budgets. In particular, the reactions of NO3 with alkenes, and most importantly with isoprene and terpenes, proceed rapidly. The significance of the removal of unsaturated hydrocarbons at night on regional to global scales and throughout the year is thus far poorly constrained. A recent hydrocarbon clock analysis of multiyear observations in Europe16,17 concluded that unsaturated hydrocarbons are more efficiently removed by NO3 than daytime OH chemistry on regional scales. Similarly, a significant contribution of nighttime isoprene oxidation by NO3 was found in certain areas of the north-eastern United States.18
 Fig. 1  Schematic description of the atmospheric chemical processes involving NO3 and N2O5. 
A consequence of the NO3 + alkene reactions, together with the ozonolysis of alkenes, is the initiation of active radical chemistry which explains the presence of OH, HO2, and RO2 radicals at night.
Nocturnal radical chemistry is known to lead to a loss of ozone and nitrogen oxides through its various homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction pathways.19 These mechanisms thus impact the availability of these compounds for the photochemistry during the next day.20,21 Various observational studies have found that up to 50% of emitted NOx throughout a 24-hour period in urban areas can be removed through nocturnal processes.22,23
The heterogeneous chemistry of N2O5 with particles impacts the composition of the inorganic aerosol component. The uptake of N2O5 into aerosol particles leads to the formation of nitrate and the volatilization of halogens.24
Reactions of NO3 with dimethylsulfide, DMS, impact the sulphur cycle in marine areas.25 Recent studies point out that NO3 chemistry dominates the oxidation of DMS in coastal areas26–28 and that globally 24% of DMS is oxidized by reaction with NO3.29 Nighttime chemistry thus impacts the formation of sulphate aerosol and CCN formation in the marine atmosphere.
The heterogeneous chemistry of N2O5 leads to the formation of ClNO2, a daytime chlorine radical precursor.30,31 These processes thus strongly influence morning radical chemistry and consequently the formation of daytime ozone.32 This process is not limited to marine areas, where aerosol chloride is abundant, but also occurs in continental environments removed from the ocean.33
Reactions of NO3 with alkenes and terpenes lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in high yields.34 However, the impact of this chemistry on regional and global aerosol levels is still poorly constrained. On a regional scale the SOA contribution from NO3 + isoprene can exceed the SOA formation by OH + isoprene chemistry18 and enhance aerosol by 30–40%.35 The significance of NO3 chemistry for SOA on a global scale is controversial, with some models indicating a modest impact35 and others estimating it to be responsible for 21% of SOA globally.36
NO3 and N2O5 play a crucial role in the stratospheric nitrogen and ozone chemistry. N2O5 formation dominates the diurnal pattern of NOx, i.e. 30–50% of atmospheric NOx is in the form of N2O5 at the end of a typical night in the lower stratosphere,37 and is responsible for much of the loss of NOx in the polar stratospheric winter.38 The enhanced uptake of N2O5 on volcanic sulphate aerosol, for example following the 1992 El Pinatubo explosion, has also been associated with observed NO2 depletion,39 increase of active chlorine species,40 and the consequent depletion of stratospheric ozone.41 Recently, stratospheric NO3 and N2O5 have received renewed attention, following a geo-engineering proposal to regulate the earth's albedo via injection of sulphate aerosol precursors into the stratosphere.42,43
These examples show that the nocturnal radical chemistry is prevalent in many environments of the atmosphere and impacts a number of central chemicals systems, such as those of sulphur, nitrogen, halogens and aerosol. Here we will review the current state of knowledge of nocturnal radical chemistry with a particular focus on its impact on these chemical systems. The focus will be on the knowledge acquired since the extensive review of NO3 chemistry by Wayne et al.,44 although some overlap is unavoidable. A recent review on radical chemistry by Monks45 also includes a brief description of nocturnal radical chemistry. Chang et al.46 have also recently reviewed the atmospheric chemistry and atmospheric measurement techniques for N2O5, although these authors did not explicitly review the radical chemistry of NO3.
We will begin this review with a short introduction into the well-known dominant chemical pathways of nocturnal radicals. The observational database of nocturnal radicals will be reviewed in Section 2. A detailed discussion of nocturnal chemistry as it pertains to today's research on NO3 and N2O5 will follow in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. We end this review with a discussion on current research needs in Section 5.
1.1 The NO3 and N2O5 chemical system
By far the largest source of NO3 in the atmosphere is the reaction of NO2 with ozone: NO2 + O3 → NO3 + O2(R1.1)Other, minor NO3 sources include the reaction of OH with HNO347 and the photolysis of some organic nitrates.48,49 The recommended rate of reaction (R1.1) at room temperature is k1.1 = 3.2 × 10−17 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. The reaction rate is temperature dependent, slowing down considerably at lower temperature. For example at 273 K k1.1 = 1.5 × 10−17 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 is about half of the room temperature value.50
During the day NO3 is efficiently photolyzed: NO3 + hν → NO2 + O(R1.2a)   → NO + O2(R1.2b)
The quantum yields of these two channels depend strongly on wavelength, but generally the branching ratio between reaction (R1.2b) and (R1.2a) is 0.1–0.13.51 Photolysis rates for noontime conditions are in the range of J1.2a = 0.156 s−1 and J1.2b = 0.02 s−1 at noon.51
Another important NO3 loss reaction is that with NO: NO3 + NO → 2NO2(R1.3)
With a room temperature rate constant of k1.3 (298 K) = 2.6 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1,50 this reaction leads to short lifetimes of NO3 in the presence of NO, i.e. for [NO] = 2.5 × 109 molecule cm−3 (∼0.1 ppbv at STP) the lifetime of NO3 is only ∼15 seconds. This reaction is thus important during the day, when its rate often exceeds that of photolysis,52 and near NO sources, such as surface traffic and power plants at night.
The formation of NO3, which requires the presence of NO2, is always accompanied by the formation and thermal decomposition of N2O5. NO2 + NO3 + (M) → N2O5 + (M)(R1.4) N2O5 + (M) → NO2 + NO3 +(M)(R1.5)While reaction (R1.4) shows little temperature dependence,50 the thermal decomposition depends strongly on temperature. At temperatures around 290 K the lifetime of N2O5 due to thermal decomposition is ∼40 seconds. This time increases to ∼700 seconds at 270 K and reaches times in the range of months to years under stratospheric conditions.53,54
Under many tropospheric conditions NO3, NO2 and N2O5 thus reach an equilibrium, which can be expressed by a temperature dependent equilibrium constant: Keq = 5.50 × 10−27 × exp(10724/T)(1.1)
Of the other gas-phase reactions of NO3 (see Sander et al.,50 2011 and Atkinson et al.,54 for details) the most important for tropospheric chemistry are those with hydrocarbons. While reactions with saturated hydrocarbons are typically slow, those with unsaturated hydrocarbons are fast enough to be significant for the overall hydrocarbon budget. In particular, the reactions of NO3 with biogenic hydrocarbons, such as terpenes, are quite fast.55 In general, the first step of these reactions is the addition of the NO3 radical to the carbon double bond: NO3 + R1–CC–R2 → R1–C–C(NO3)–R2(R1.6)The resulting nitroxyalkyl radical can then rapidly react with O2 forming a nitroxyalkyl-peroxy radical (RH–ONO2–O2). NO3 is also known to efficiently react with oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as aldehydes and phenolic compounds. We will further discuss the details of these reactions in Section 3.
Aside from some controversy over the direct reaction with water vapour (discussed in Section 4.4), gas-phase reactions of N2O5 are not very important for tropospheric chemistry. In the stratosphere, the photolysis of N2O5 at wavelengths below 400 nm plays an important role.37 N2O5 + hν (λ < 400 nm) → NO3 + NO2(R1.7a)   → NO3 + NO + O(3P)(R1.7b)   → NO3 + NO2*(R1.7c)The products of the N2O5 photolysis are NO3 at a quantum yield of 1, and a mixture of NO2, electronically excited NO2* and NO + O, where the amount of NO2* depends on the wavelength of the actinic flux.50,56 Due to the insignificant thermal decomposition of N2O5 in the stratosphere, photolysis is responsible for the daytime re-release of NOx from its nocturnal N2O5 reservoir. In many cases reactions (R1.4) and (R1.7) dominate the diurnal cycle of stratospheric NOx.57–59
NO3 and, even more importantly, N2O5, also efficiently interact with liquid and solid surfaces. NO3 is known to efficiently react with soot particles, dust, liquid and frozen organic particles, as well as dry sodium salts. The NO3 uptake leads to a variety of surface reactions, including the oxidation of organic molecules and soot that will be discussed in more detail in Section 3.
The most important heterogeneous reaction for the global atmosphere is the hydrolysis of N2O5, forming nitric acid. N2O5 + H2O(l) → 2HNO3(R1.8)This reaction is known to occur on many surfaces. It is, for example, responsible for the depletion of NOx from the stratosphere in polar winters. The uptake of N2O5 on chloride containing particles is also known to release ClNO2 (see Section 4 for details).
1.2 HOx and ROx chemistry
While NO3 is often the dominant nocturnal radical species, especially under conditions with elevated NOx concentrations, the presence of the hydroxyl radical, OH, and the related hydroperoxy, HO2, and larger peroxy radicals, RO2, in the nocturnal atmosphere has been experimentally confirmed.6–8,60–69 RO2 radicals have been observed at night in these studies at levels between 1–40 pptv,7,8,60–63,65,67 in some cases associated with NO3 radicals at similar mixing ratios.70 The nocturnal levels of HO2 and OH are more uncertain, with reported nocturnal HO2 concentrations of 0–10 pptv.7,63,64,68,71 Nocturnal OH concentrations are typically in the range between 0–2 × 105 molecule cm−3.63,68 However, higher concentrations, as high as 106 molecule cm−3, have also been observed.6,68
It should be noted that there is an on-going discussion about the accuracy of OH and HO2 measurements.72,73 It is beyond the scope of this review to address the implications of these recent findings to past observations of these radicals and we refer the reader to the literature on OH and HO2 measurements (this issue).
It is established now that HOx and ROx radicals are chemically produced at night.63,65,66 Two main formation mechanisms have been identified. The first pathway proceeds through the oxidation of VOCs by NO3, ultimately forming RO2 radicals.74,75 The significance of this pathway depends on the availability of both NO3, i.e. the presence of NOx, and high levels of unsaturated VOCs, in particular of terpenes.8,63,66 In these environments NO3 + VOC is the dominant pathway for RO2 formation.63,66 RO2 can then further react with NO, NO3, ozone and other ROx radicals to produce alkoxy radicals, peroxy dinitrates, hydrogen peroxide or other hydro peroxides, as well as other stable products.74 The further reaction of the alkoxy radical follows similar pathways as during the day, for example forming HO2, aldehydes, or decaying/isomerizing. We will further discuss this chemistry in Section 3.
The second pathway to form nocturnal HOx radicals is through the ozonolysis of unsaturated hydrocarbons of 5 or more carbon atoms.74,76,77 The addition of ozone to the carbon double bond forms a primary ozonide, which, after rapid decomposition, leads to the formation of a Criegee intermediate. HOx radicals are then formed following the decomposition of this intermediate. OH yields from the ozonolysis of alkenes have been reported in the range of 0.07 to 1.78 The OH formed from the VOC ozonolysis will continue to oxidize other available VOCs following the typical daytime RO2–HO2–OH reaction chain,74 which we will not further discuss here. The only difference between the daytime and nighttime reaction chain is the common absence of NO in the air mass, and consequently an increased importance of reactions of NO3 and O3 with the various radicals.
Ozonolysis of VOCs is a major source of nighttime radicals, in particular when NOx, and thus NO3, concentrations are low. Analysis of field data has shown that it can account for up to 99% of the nocturnal OH radical formation, 92% of HO2 formation, and over 66% of RO2 formation.79
1.3 Influence of boundary layer meteorology
A complicating factor in the discussion of nocturnal chemistry in the troposphere is the influence of vertical mixing and the diurnal variation of the atmospheric boundary layer structure (Fig. 2). As the sun sets, the surface cools due to radiative energy loss. This leads to the formation of the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL), which in many cases is only 50–200 m deep. The NBL is characterized by suppressed vertical mixing, i.e. stable vertical stability,80 which inhibits upward transport of trace gases emitted at the surface. Between the top of the NBL and the free troposphere a residual layer forms, which contains air from the previous daytime boundary layer. This layer is effectively decoupled from the surface and thus is not impacted by nocturnal surface emissions. The residual layer often shows weak mixing and layering. Upon solar heating during the morning, the developing convective boundary layer grows in depth, mixing with the residual layer to form the daytime boundary layer.

Because mixing is inefficient and sporadic within the stable nocturnal boundary layer,80 its composition becomes altitude dependent in the presence of surface emissions. The most prominent of such environments are urban areas at night where the titration of ozone by surface emission of NO, NO + O3 → NO2 + O2(R1.9)leads to prominent vertical profiles of ozone, with low concentrations near the surface, and concentrations comparable to daytime levels at the top of the NBL and in the residual layer.81 NO2 shows opposite profiles, while NO decreases strongly with altitude, often decreasing to negligible levels aloft. The presence of NO near the surface also leads to vertical concentration profiles of NO3, and consequently N2O5, due to reaction (R1.3). Similarly, the surface emissions of biogenic hydrocarbons and DMS can lead to vertical profiles of NO3 and N2O5 in the NBL.
The diurnal cycle of boundary layer structure and the altitude dependence of NBL composition have several consequences for nocturnal radical chemistry:

In situ measurements at one altitude are often not representative for the entire extent of the lower atmosphere (see Section 2).
Because the highly structured NBL and residual layer are mixed together in the morning, the impact of nocturnal chemistry needs to consider the entire altitude range that will become the daytime boundary layer.
Nocturnal micrometeorology is a crucial, non-chemical, influence that in many cases strongly impacts nocturnal chemistry. It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss nocturnal meteorological processes, and the reader is referred to available literature on this topic.82–87
2. Field Measurements of NO3 and N2O5
This section reviews results from intensive field measurements over the last 30+ years that have included direct measurements of NO3 and/or N2O5, or that have estimated the impact of these species in a particular chemical environment based on measurements of other species. The review begins with a brief description of analytical techniques and methods commonly used for analysis of observed NO3 and N2O5 mixing ratios. The measurements themselves are sorted by environment (e.g., urban vs. forested), following the broad outlines of nighttime chemistry discussed in the introduction.
2.1 Measurement techniques
The nitrate radical has distinct, strong absorption bands in the red portion of the visible spectrum centred at 623 and 662 nm88 that have formed the basis for most approaches to measure its ambient concentration. The first two decades of field work on NO3 was based primarily on differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS)89–91 over long open paths in the atmosphere. The technique can be passive, using natural light sources such as the moon,13,92 starlight3 or scattering sunlight at dusk or dawn.93 It can also be active, using an artificial light source such as an arc lamp or light emitting diode (LED94) aligned over a fixed, kilometre-scale atmospheric path (long path DOAS, or LP-DOAS). LP-DOAS has become a common measurement scheme for NO3 and other radical species with visible or ultraviolet absorption bands.95,96 It has been applied across a wide variety of environments, from highly polluted to remote. Although the technique does not provide a direct measurement of N2O5, DOAS NO3 measurements are typically concurrent with those of NO2 (which also has characteristic visible absorption bands), enabling calculation of N2O5 along the light path based on the temperature-dependent equilibrium constant, Keq(T), from eqn (1.1). [N2O5] = Keq(T)[NO2][NO3](2.1)For example, Atkinson et al.97 applied this method to DOAS measurements of NO2 and NO3 in the Los Angeles basin to estimate ambient N2O5 mixing ratios up to 15 ppbv in the early 1980s.
Both passive and active DOAS techniques can be used to measure vertical profiles of NO3, although the two methods operate on very different spatial scales. Vertically resolved information is often critical in understanding NO3 and N2O5 since they are present predominantly at night when the boundary layer is shallow and poorly mixed. Thus, surface level measurements alone do not always present a complete picture of nighttime atmospheric chemistry.98,99 Passive DOAS measurements of NO3 column density at sunrise provide coarse resolution vertical information over an altitude range from the boundary layer through the stratosphere. These measurements utilize either moonlight100 or scattered sunlight101–103 and take advantage of the photolytic destruction of NO3 to progressively lower altitudes as the solar zenith angle approaches 90°. The time dependence of the column density during this period is equivalent to a vertical profile. Long-path DOAS measurements have been demonstrated on multiple axes aligned over different altitude ranges, for example by mounting retro-reflectors at different heights on tall buildings within an urban area, with detection limits in the range of 1 pptv.22 This approach yields finer resolution data within and above the nocturnal boundary layer and is not restricted to sunrise measurements alone.
There are now several approaches for in situ (i.e., not over kilometre-scale optical paths) measurements of NO3 (and N2O5). The first was the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy work of Mihelcic and co-workers.7,104,105 The ESR method is a sensitive and specific analytical method for open-shell species, such as RO2, HO2, NO2 and NO3. It involves cryogenic collection of air samples in an H2O or D2O matrix followed by laboratory ESR analysis of the collected samples. Although the method compares favourably with DOAS,104 it has not seen widespread use outside of a few field campaigns in Germany in the 1980s and 1990s. The first in situ optical detection of NO3 was the work of Simpson and co-workers, who used cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS)106 to demonstrate measurement of NO3 in laboratory air samples using its 662 nm absorption band. Cavity ring-down spectroscopy107 is one of a class of so-called cavity enhanced spectroscopy (CES) methods108,109 that take advantage of the long effective path lengths associated with an optical cavity formed from high reflectivity mirrors to achieve high sensitivity spectroscopic detection. The reported sensitivity for NO3 with CRDS is as good as 0.2 pptv in a 1 second average with an effective path length (1/e decay) of approximately 60 km.110 Brown and co-workers demonstrated the first in-field detection of NO3 using CRDS, along with the first direct detection of N2O5via its thermal conversion to NO3,111–113 also subsequently demonstrated by Simpson and co-workers114,115 and several other research groups.116–119 These instruments used fixed wavelength, 662 nm detection of NO3 and zeroing by chemical titration of NO3 with NO in the inlet to achieve optical detection specific to NO3, free from interference from other absorbers such as NO2, H2O or O3. These instruments require an inlet filter to remove aerosol for high-sensitivity measurement. In some cases, they use an automated filter changer,110 along with a calibration based on chemical conversion of NO3 to NO2, to minimize and characterize wall and filter losses for accurate measurements.120 Ball and co-workers demonstrated broadband cavity ring-down spectroscopy (BB-CRDS),121–124 and later broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (BB-CEAS) using LED light sources,125,126 for in situ detection of NO3 and N2O5 in a configuration that uses a DOAS-type approach to spectral fitting. These instruments have an advantage in that they do not necessarily require NO titration or aerosol filtering for accurate measurement. Both CRDS110,127 and BB-CEAS125 instruments have been deployed as aircraft instruments, enabling high-resolution vertically resolved measurements. Several research groups have also demonstrated broadband cavity enhanced measurements using open cavities (for example in environmental simulation chambers) for artefact-free detection of NO3 alone.128–132
Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) is another high-sensitivity optical method that has been applied to in situ NO3 detection (and N2O5via thermal conversion) using its visible absorption bands.133–136 The method is somewhat less sensitive for NO3136 than for other open-shell species, such as NO2137 or OH.138 Finally, chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) is a non-optical, in situ method with recent applications to specific and high sensitivity detection of NO3 (with thermal conversion for N2O5)139 or for direct measurement of N2O5.140,141
The recent review of the heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry of N2O5 by Chang et al.46 discusses ambient measurement techniques for NO3 and N2O5, including detection sensitivities, instrument accuracy and instrument intercomparisons in more detail. Readers interested in a more in-depth discussion of these instruments should consult this reference.
2.2 NO3 and N2O5 analysis metrics
Before proceeding with a description of field measurements, it is useful to describe analysis methods for NO3 and N2O5 that are common to understanding their behaviour in nearly all environments. The first is the production rate for nitrate radicals, P(NO3), commonly expressed in units of parts per billion by volume per hour (ppbv h−1). P(NO3) = k1.1[O3][NO2](2.2)Here, k1.1 is the temperature-dependent, bimolecular rate coefficient for the reaction of NO2 with O3.54,142 This production rate describes the maximum instantaneous source of NO3 radicals available for any given process (e.g., oxidation of VOCs or formation of N2O5, which may undergo subsequent heterogeneous reactions), and it can vary from <10−3 ppbv h−1 in remote areas with low NOx to >10 ppbv h−1 in the most polluted urban environments. Because the association of NO3 with NO2 is rapid in comparison to NO3 production itself, the nitrate radical production rate is equivalent to the total production rate for the sum of NO3 and N2O5, and is essentially the same as the N2O5 production rate under conditions where this species dominates the pair.
A second universal metric for NO3 and N2O5 is their steady state lifetime, τ, or the ratio of their concentration to the NO3 production rate.11,143 Lifetimes are commonly expressed either as that for NO3 or N2O5 alone, or for the sum of the two. τ(NO3) = NO3/P(NO3)(2.3) τ(N2O5) = N2O5/P(NO3)(2.4) τ(Sum) = (NO3 + N2O5)/P(NO3)(2.5)These quantities have units of time and are a common measure of reactivity that is convenient in that it is based solely on measurements of NO3 (and/or N2O5), NO2, O3 and temperature. The inverse of the lifetime, also referred to as a loss frequency, is also a common reactivity metric.144 Because NO3 and N2O5 interconvert easily, the individual lifetimes in eqn (2.3)–(2.5) are not independent measures of the reactivity of one species or the other. Their use as a measure of reactivity also relies on the assumption that measured concentrations of NO3 and N2O5 are in approximate steady state between their production and loss. This approximation fails under conditions where the sinks for both species are slow enough that the system does not reach steady state (e.g., remote areas with low VOC and aerosol),145 cold and/or high NO2 conditions where the difference between the forward and backward reactions governing the NO2–NO3–N2O5 equilibrium is large relative to the NO3 production rate,143 or where transport and mixing effects are significant compared to the local NO3 production rate.22
2.3 Urban air
Since NO3 and N2O5 derive almost exclusively from the oxidation of NO2 by O3, and since NO2 is principally anthropogenic in origin, the largest concentration and impacts of these nighttime nitrogen oxides often occur within and downwind of urban areas. This section is organized by the regions in which these studies have occurred, beginning with the Los Angeles basin and other regions of North America, followed by measurements in Europe and Asia.
The original measurements of NO3 in the troposphere occurred in the polluted urban atmosphere of the Los Angeles basin, as described above and as shown in Fig. 3.2 The campaign consisted of a total of 15 measurement days in August–September 1979 spread across two different sites, Claremont and Riverside, CA. This study found significant night-to-night variability in the observed NO3 levels, with maximum concentrations ranging from below the 8–30 pptv detection limit to a maximum of 355 pptv. The actual maximum may have been closer to 300 pptv, however, since these authors used a 662 nm cross NO3 cross section (1.8 × 10−17 cm288) that is approximately 20% smaller than more recent measurements.146,147 The NO3 maximum typically occurred just a few hours after sunset, with mixing ratios decreasing over the remainder of the night. Ozone and NO2 levels in this study were very large, with ozone above 100 ppbv well into the evening on several occasions, and NO2 up to 82 ppbv at night in Riverside. The authors did not report P(NO3) directly, but for the conditions associated with their maximum NO3 concentrations (196 ppbv O3, 82 ppbv NO2, T = 29.1 °C), P(NO3) was equal to 57 ppbv h−1. Although large, the observed NO3 and calculated N2O5 (up to 10.9 ppbv) were modest relative to this extreme production rate, such that the NO3 lifetimes were always less than 1 minute, and on several nights less than 10 seconds. The authors speculated on the possible loss mechanisms that would give rise to this rapid reactivity, including the hydrolysis of N2O5. However, their study did not include enough ancillary data to constrain the losses. Their measurements may also have been in close enough proximity to emission sources that the system did not reach steady state, so that the reported lifetimes were lower limits to the actual lifetimes of either NO3 or N2O5.

A more limited set of 4 measurement nights in September, 1983, in Riverside, CA, found similar temporal profiles for NO3, with a peak in early evening, albeit at somewhat lower mixing ratios (maximum <100 pptv).9 A subsequent study in the fall of 1984 at sites in the East Los Angeles basin, including Riverside, found levels of NO3 up to 430 pptv (again, using the older, lower cross section).148 A later analysis of these data, along with other data from locations in Germany, Ireland and Colorado (see below), determined that N2O5 levels could be as large as 15 ppbv (at least at that time), and that such levels might be detectable by infrared spectroscopic techniques.97 No such detection of N2O5 in urban atmospheres has ever been demonstrated, however. The analysis of the urban and downwind NO3 temporal profiles provided an upper limit for the gas-phase, homogeneous reaction of N2O5 with water vapour of approximately 1 × 10−21 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, a value which would still give rise to significant generation of HNO3 overnight (see below). Biermann et al.149 presented results from a September, 1985 study in Claremont, CA, that also included DOAS measurements of both NO3 and HONO, along with several other species that could be measured spectroscopically. Their instrument used a folded, 25 m base path to achieve measurements within a single air mass. However, they did not observe NO3 above their 20 pptv detection limit for the majority of the study, with the exception of one hour periods just after sunset on two nights, when NO3 reached a maximum of 70 pptv. As with the earlier measurements, this campaign was likely influenced by local emission sources close to ground level, limiting the ability to observe the nighttime growth of NO3.
Platt et al.11 also carried out a set of measurements at four desert sites in southern California (Whitewater, Phelan, Death Valley and Edwards Air Force Base), generally downwind of the Los Angeles basin, from October 1981 to May 1982. Whitewater is a site just east of Bannig pass and directly east of the Los Angeles basin, while the other sites are to the north and east of Los Angeles. In these downwind air masses, well removed from the direct urban sources, observed NO2 and O3 levels were much lower, but NO3 levels were still observed at mixing ratios generally in the range 10–100 pptv, even for the low NO2 site at Death Valley. The NO3 steady state lifetimes were in the range of minutes, rather than seconds, with maximum values approaching one hour. The authors determined a strong anticorrelation of NO3 lifetime with relative humidity (RH), with the longest lifetimes observed below 50% RH, near the efflorescence point of ammonium sulphate aerosols.150 This dependence provided strong evidence for a sink of N2O5via its hydrolysis reaction to produce HNO3 by heterogeneous uptake to aerosol.
Following the early work in the 1970s and 1980s, there were no further direct measurements of NO3 or N2O5 in the Los Angeles basin or its surroundings until the work of Chen et al. in 2003–2004, who reported column abundances of NO3 measured in nighttime lunar spectra over the course of one year at the Table Mountain observatory in the mountains above Pasadena, CA.151 Although the main focus of this work was to validate satellite measurements of the stratospheric column, the authors used a comparison with a co-located LP-DOAS instrument to determine the contribution of boundary layer NO3 to their measurements in August–September, 2004. The LP-DOAS reported mixing ratios in excess of 200 pptv on at least one night.
The recent CalNex field intensive in 2010 (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/calnex/) included aircraft, ground and ship-based measurements of NO3 and N2O5, and will likely provide a wealth of data and analysis on nighttime radical chemistry and halogen activation processes in Los Angeles for comparison to the earlier work in this region. Currently, the only manuscript in publication is the work of Stark et al.,152 who used aircraft measurements to determine the influence of urban lighting on NO3 photolysis as a sink for NO3 and N2O5 at night. The effect is small, but measurable, accounting for up to 2–3% of the NO3 loss in some brightly lit regions of Los Angeles.
Other studies in California have examined nighttime radicals in the San Joaquin Valley and the San Francisco Bay area. During 27 nights in July–August, 1990, Smith et al.153 measured NO3 using LP-DOAS at a site south of Bakersfield, CA, in the southern San Joaquin Valley. Average temporal profiles of NO3 showed a double maximum, with a peak of 30 pptv after sunset and a second maximum near 15 pptv at 3 AM. There was significant night-to-night variability, however, as in the Los Angeles studies. The averaged calculated P(NO3) based on the presented NO2 and O3 data was approximately 2 ppbv h−1, while the τ(NO3) were in the range 50–300 s, similar to but slightly larger than those from the Los Angeles studies. Direct comparison of the relative humidity dependence of these lifetimes showed agreement with the prior analysis of Platt et al.11 Based on these observations, the authors calculated a nighttime NOx loss rate of 0.6 ppbv h−1, which they compared to a daytime loss rate for photochemical oxidation of NO2 by OH at the same site of 0.8 ppbv h−1. They concluded that daytime and nighttime NOx losses were comparable, although they suggested multiple potential routes for nighttime NOx loss, including N2O5 heterogeneous or homogeneous hydrolysis, and NO3 reactions with hydrocarbons. Wood et al.154 used an in situ LIF instrument to measure N2O5 concentrations at a ground site east of the San Francisco Bay Area in January 2004. They observed relatively modest mixing ratios up to a maximum of 200 pptv, which corresponded to a steady state lifetime for N2O5, τ(N2O5), of less than 5 minutes for the entire study. The authors did not report NO3 or its lifetime for comparison to other studies. However, they showed that during winter in this urban environment, the conversion of NO2 to HNO3via the rapid N2O5 hydrolysis would constitute an overnight NOx sink of 1.4–5.9 ppbv.
Early measurements of NO3 also took place at a mountain site influenced by the urban plume of Denver, CO, USA.1 The same study also reported an unsuccessful attempt to measure NO3 above the instrumental detection limit in urban air in Boulder, CO. Although the authors did not present production rates or lifetimes specifically, they observed NO3 in the range 30–100 pptv for NO2 mixing ratios of 1–10 ppbv, likely corresponding the P(NO3) of 0.05–0.5 ppbv h−1, much smaller than in Los Angeles. The inferred τ(NO3) were nevertheless short enough that the authors focussed most of their discussion on the possible reactions that would rapidly scavenge NO3 or N2O5. Perner et al.155 carried out a similar study at the same mountain site to directly measure the equilibrium constant for the reversible association of NO2 with NO3 to form N2O5. They showed field data in which NO3 steadily built up over the course of one night to a concentration near 60 pptv. From the sunrise decay of NO3 and the sunrise increase of NO2, inferred to have been produced from conversion of N2O5 to NO2 as the NO3 was photochemically destroyed, they produced an estimate of the equilibrium constant that was in good agreement with laboratory studies. Solomon and co-workers13,100,156 measured NO3 column densities in lunar light from the same Colorado observatory. Their goal was to determine the stratospheric component. They developed a method for vertical profiling based on the time-dependence of the column density during sunrise, as photochemical NO3 destruction proceeds from high altitude to low. Their boundary layer determinations suggested an average NO3 concentration of approximately 20 pptv, and they suggested that at this level, nighttime isoprene oxidation by reaction with NO3 would be approximately as rapid as that due to OH during daytime.156
Following the development of CRDS based in situ instruments for NO3 and N2O5, Brown et al.143,157,158 reported a series of measurements at sites in and around Boulder, CO, also influenced by the Denver urban plume. Measurements during October–November, 2001 on a mesa site approximately 150 m above the city of Boulder158 showed variability in NO3 and N2O5, both from one night to the next, and on much shorter time scales of several seconds. Observed levels varied from instrumental detection limits up to 100 pptv and 3 ppbv for NO3 and N2O5, respectively. These nighttime nitrogen oxides represented a large fraction (up to 30%) of labile reactive nitrogen (defined as NO2 + NO3 + 2N2O5), with N2O5 serving as a reservoir species that quantitatively converted to NO2 at sunrise. The analysis showed that the ratio of N2O5 to NO3 closely followed its predicted equilibrium value throughout the night, deviating only at sunset and sunrise, when photochemical sinks were active. Steady state NO3 lifetimes were in the range of several minutes within the urban plume, but up to 40 minutes during strong downslope flow in the Rocky Mountain foothills, when free tropospheric or stratospheric air influenced the site.143 These authors also reported high-resolution vertical profiling of NO3, N2O5 and a few related compounds from a tall tower with a movable carriage located approximately 35 km north of Denver, CO in October, 2004.157 These results showed a similar range in NO3 and N2O5 mixing ratios as the ground based studies, to approximately 0.1 and 2 ppbv, respectively, but with clear gradients as a function of height. In particular, τ(NO3) varied from <2 minutes below the height of the nocturnal boundary layer at approximately 100 m to 35 minutes above this level.
Two research groups have analysed nighttime chemical data in Phoenix, Arizona, USA, an urban location in the desert. Gaffney et al.159 reported measurements of NO2, O3 and several other species in May and June 1998 at Usury Pass, a higher altitude site on the downwind side of the Phoenix basin. They presented no direct NO3 measurements but did show that P(NO3) varied up to approximately 2.5 ppbv h−1 at that site, and they further speculated that these radical production rates would have a significant impact on local nitrogen oxide chemistry. Wang et al.160 reported vertically resolved LP-DOAS measurements of NO3, NO2 and several other trace gases in June–July 2001 in the Phoenix downtown area. Their vertically resolved measurements included 3 light paths from the top of a tall building to 3 separate retro-reflectors at different heights to span a total altitude range of 140 m. The NO3 mixing ratios varied up to 200 pptv in the upper height range, but showed strong negative vertical gradients toward ground level. The NO3 production rate varied from approximately 0.4–1.2 ppbv h−1 with height, but was generally larger at surface level than aloft, leading to strong gradients in NO3 lifetime, with values of nearly 20 minutes aloft. The authors concluded that the factors governing nighttime NOx loss were strongly height dependent and complex.
There have been several field intensives in recent years in and around the urban area of Houston, TX, USA that have included measurements of nighttime radicals. The rationale for these studies has been the high ozone levels in that region that are due in part to emissions from the petrochemical industry that is concentrated along the U.S. Gulf Coast.161 During the first Texas Air Quality study in late summer 2000, Stutz et al.22 measured vertically resolved mixing ratios of NO3 and other trace gases by LP-DOAS using five different light paths aligned on different heights to a maximum of 115 m above ground level. Like the Phoenix study described above, NO3 mixing ratios and steady-state lifetimes both showed a positive gradient with height above ground level, reaching average values of 60 pptv and approximately 10 min, respectively, above 100 m altitude, with values less than 25 pptv and 1 minute, respectively, at surface level. A one dimensional chemical transport model constructed to describe these observations showed that the observed gradients result from both upward fluxes of reactive surface emissions, such as NO and VOCs, and downward fluxes of N2O5, which serve to maintain a ground-level concentration of NO3.162 During the second Texas Air Quality Study in the summer of 2006, Stutz et al.23 used a similar vertically resolved LP-DOAS apparatus aligned on three light paths with a maximum height range of 20–300 m at a site near downtown Houston. The results showed strong, positive vertical gradients in NO3, calculated N2O5, and τ(NO3) with height, with NO3 mixing ratios reaching 150 pptv in the upper height interval (130–300 m) with a lifetime well in excess of 1000 s (17 min). Furthermore, the study demonstrated the strong influence of NO3 on hydrocarbon oxidation within the urban area of Houston, which is impacted by strong emissions of reactive alkenes from petrochemical facilities. Reaction with alkenes, principally isoprene, isobutene (2-methyl-1-propene) and 1,3-butadiene, were by far the dominant NO3 loss pathways, and were far more important than heterogeneous reactions of either NO3 or N2O5. These reactive VOCs, including nighttime isoprene associated with the petrochemical industry, were all anthropogenic in origin. The study showed nighttime NOx loss rates on the order of 1 ppbv h−1 on average, approximately 16–50% of the integrated total diurnal NOx loss below 300 m. Nighttime aircraft measurements during the 2006 Houston study complemented the ground-based analysis of NO3 and N2O5 chemistry. Brown et al.163,164 reported results from a series of four aircraft flights that surveyed the Houston urban area and other regions of Texas. Production rates for NO3 ranged from 1–2 ppbv h−1 in lofted pollution plumes from Houston, with associated mixing ratios of NO3 and N2O5 up to 0.4 and 3.2 ppbv, respectively (Fig. 4). Loss of NO3 and N2O5 was dominated by NO3–VOC reactions, with anthropogenic VOCs being the dominant component, as in the ground-based analysis. The nitrate radical was also the dominant nighttime oxidant, with net oxidation rates some 3–5 times faster than those due to ozone. Heterogeneous uptake of N2O5 was responsible for only about ¼ of the net loss of NO3 and N2O5, due in part to the small uptake coefficients determined for its uptake, which are described further in Section 4.3. Finally, Luria et al.,165 reported on night flights in Texas, including the Houston urban plume, from a summer 2005 study. Their measurements included reactive nitrogen species, but did not include NO3 or N2O5 directly. Their analysis suggested rapid nighttime oxidation of NOx to oxidized reactive nitrogen, with essentially complete oxidation within the course of a single night.

The studies in Houston also included ship-based measurements of nighttime chemistry within urban and industrial plumes on the U.S. Gulf Coast. These are reviewed in Section 4.5 below on halogen activation.
Back to back field intensives in the summers of 2002 and 2004 investigated nighttime chemistry in the northeast United States, with a focus on New England.166 These intensives included ground, ship and aircraft based measurements of NO3 and N2O5. Several of these results are also reviewed in the next section on marine environments. Brown et al.167 analysed ship-based measurements of NO3, N2O5 (by CRDS) and HNO3 (by mist-chamber/ion chromatography168) within the polluted urban outflow of New York, Boston and smaller cities within New Hampshire. They found modest (100 pptv) average levels of N2O5 that corresponded to steady state lifetimes on the order of a few minutes. The diurnal average of HNO3 showed a sharp maximum at midday, corresponding to photochemical oxidation of NO2 by OH, and a broader nighttime maximum due to N2O5 hydrolysis and reaction of NO3 with dimethyl sulphide (DMS). These observations, together with the invariance in the depth of the marine boundary layer in summer, allowed for a quantitative determination of the fraction of NOx oxidized by daytime and nighttime processes, with approximately 1/3 of the total NOx oxidation occurring at night. The analysis did not account for the potential conversion of N2O5 to ClNO2 (nitryl chloride), reviewed in Section 4.5, which was thought to be small at that time. The omission of this process would not have changed the conclusions related to NOx loss, however, which were based mainly on the observation of HNO3.
The 2004 New England field intensive included the first aircraft measurements of NO3 and N2O5, which took place during a series of six night flights in July and August. A principal result of the initial aircraft work was to identify the regional variability in the heterogeneous uptake of N2O5.169 The aircraft sampled nighttime NOx plumes from a variety of sources, including urban areas and coal-fired electric power generation plants. Although the regional variation in the NO3 production rate was similar from these sources, up to approximately 2 ppbv h−1, the NO3 and N2O5 lifetimes were much shorter over Ohio and Pennsylvania in a region with high loading of sulphate aerosol derived from a large concentration of coal-fired power plants. A technique used to separate the individual contributions of NO3 and N2O5 sinks to the total lifetime demonstrated that most of the variability was in the rate of N2O5 loss, with relatively little in the NO3 sink. The study demonstrated the influence of sulphur emissions on nitrogen oxide loss rates through nighttime chemistry. In regions with small N2O5 uptake coefficients, the N2O5 mixing ratios were as large as 3.2 ppbv, and they constituted a significant fraction of nocturnal odd oxygen, Ox.170 Ox = O3 + NO2 + 2NO3 + 3N2O5(2.6)Thus, N2O5 in lofted urban and power plant plumes can act either as a reservoir that regenerates NOx at sunrise, or as a sink that efficiently converts NOx to HNO3. Finally, airborne measurements of the urban plume from New York City sampled at varying distances downwind showed that the NO3 and N2O5 lifetimes could reach large values, up to 6 hours at high altitude.171 Odd oxygen analysis in the New York plume near sunrise, after overnight transport, showed very little N2O5, and also showed that the overnight loss of NOx and Ox was only partially explained by the formation of NO3,170 implying substantial mixing ratios of other reaction products, such as organic nitrates from NO3 reactions or, potentially, ClNO2 (see below).
Additional results from night flights, ship and ground based measurements in New England, including vertical profiling of the boundary layer, observations of daytime N2O5, DMS oxidation and the nighttime chemistry in power plants are reviewed in the following sections.
The major field intensives that took place in Mexico City in the spring of 2003 and 2006172 also included a limited investigation of the role of nighttime chemistry. Zheng et al.141 reported measurements of both HNO3 and N2O5 using an ion drift CIMS method from the 2006 campaign. Because their measurement site was located in downtown Mexico City, the surface-level nighttime air typically had large concentrations of NO that prevented further oxidation of nitrogen oxides to NO3 and N2O5. Little N2O5 was observable above the 20 pptv instrumental detection limit, aside from one late afternoon into evening event with approximately 40 pptv N2O5. The HNO3 data were consistent with this finding, showing evidence for rapid photochemical oxidation of NO2, but little nocturnal oxidation. Volkamer et al.173 analysed the role of N2O5 uptake in nocturnal odd oxygen loss and ClNO2 formation for the 2003 campaign, estimating a potential contribution for ClNO2 of up to 10% of the observed 2.1 ppbv h−1 nocturnal odd oxygen loss.
Measurements of urban NO3 in Europe began at approximately the same time as those in North America, with measurements at two sites, Jülich and Deuselbach, in Germany in 1979–1980.10 The NO3 levels at Jülich were frequently below detection limits, but the mixing ratios at Deuselbach in April 1980 exhibited a reasonably regular temporal pattern, peaking late in the night, with maximum mixing ratios of 40–280 pptv, except in the presence of fog. The analysis provided field-based estimates of the NO2–NO3–N2O5 equilibrium constant, as well as evidence that the hydrolysis reaction of N2O5 was an important sink.
A major field intensive outside of Berlin in July and August 1998 (the Berliner Ozonexperiment, BERLIOZ) included DOAS measurements of NO3 at four different measurement sites along with measurements of alkyl and hydroperoxy radicals by a variety of methods.70 At the Pabstthum site, both the observed NO3 mixing ratios and the production rates varied significantly, from the 1.2 pptv detection limit to 80 pptv, and from <0.1 to approximately 1.2 ppbv h−1, respectively.174 Calculated N2O5 varied up to nearly 1 ppbv. Although urban impacted, the measurement site was in a forested area and had significant levels of biogenic VOCs that led to relatively large direct loss for NO3, with first-order loss rate coefficients in the range 4 × 10−4–0.4 s−1. This was the single largest, quantifiable NO3 loss at the site. There was also significant indirect loss of NO3via N2O5 hydrolysis, which was the second most important loss process. The study included extensive VOC and aerosol characterization to quantify these losses. However, the sum of all reactions of NO3 and N2O5 still did not fully account for the NO3 loss inferred from its steady state lifetime. The simultaneous measurements of nitrate and peroxy radicals also showed the interaction of these species at night,70 and will be described in Section 3.
Field campaigns at urban sites in Great Britain include the lunar passive DOAS measurements in Cambridge and measurements made during the recent REPARTEE II campaign in London. The Cambridge measurements were from July–August 1995 and used the temporal variation at sunrise described above to separate stratospheric from tropospheric contributions in the total column measurements.101 Assigning the tropospheric signal to a 1 km boundary layer, these authors concluded that the average NO3 concentration was 89 pptv, with a maximum of 470 pptv, significantly larger than nearly any other surface level measurement. Associated NO3 lifetimes were also much longer. They suggested that surface level measurements are not representative of NO3 in the majority of the polluted boundary layer. Benton et al.175 reported LED-based BB-CEAS measurements of the sum of NO3 and N2O5 from a 160 m tower situated in downtown London during October–November 2007. Like other studies, these authors reported considerable variability in measured NO3 + N2O5 (predicted to be mostly N2O5 during this season at the site), with an average mixing ratio of 44 pptv and a maximum of nearly 800 pptv. Variability could be explained, to some extent, by measurements of turbulence, with larger levels observed during less turbulent periods, indicating that mixing from street level to the measurement height was an important factor. The authors concluded that steady-state lifetimes were not a good measure of NO3 or N2O5 losses. They did conclude, however, that N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis was likely important, and that it could result in overnight production of 4.5–13.5 ppbv HNO3 for the observed conditions.
Crowley et al.176 reported measurement of N2O5 at a coastal site in Spain using a CRDS instrument as part of the DOMINO campaign (Diel Oxidant Mechanisms In relation to Nitrogen Oxides) in November–December 2008. The site was impacted by marine, urban-industrial and continental air masses. They found extremely short (a few seconds) NO3 lifetimes associated with air masses from the local port city of Huelva, which included industrial emissions. The authors speculated that interactions between NO3 and reduced sulphur compounds from anthropogenic emissions might have been responsible for the high reactivity. Lifetimes in other air sectors, particularly those originating in the Atlantic Ocean, were much longer, up to 30 minutes. Because of the variety of source regions at this site, loss of NO3 and N2O5 were apportioned to a variety of sources, including N2O5 uptake to aerosol and NO3 reactions with NO, biogenic VOC and anthropogenic VOC.
Asaf et al.177,178 reported long-term measurements of NO3 using a DOAS instrument at an urban location in Jerusalem. The more than two-year data set spanned July 2005–September 2007 and provided an unprecedented look at NO3 seasonal variation in an urban, arid environment. They found a maximum NO3 concentration of more than 800 pptv, even at an NO3 production rate relatively typical for urban areas (in the range 2–3 ppbv h−1). Their analysis indicated an important role for NO3 in the oxidation of VOCs in Jerusalem, with 70% of the total VOC oxidation, and 75% of alkene oxidation, attributable to NO3 radicals. Average NO3 mixing ratios were 27 ± 44 pptv for the entire measurement campaign. Although this is the largest directly measured average value, it is smaller than the 89 pptv average inferred from column measurements and an assumed boundary layer thickness in Cambridge, England. The DOAS light path ran directly over the city of Jerusalem at a height of 15–100 m above surface level. High NO3 levels were driven in part by increased nighttime ozone observed at this site. The temporal profiles of NO3 were relatively more consistent at this site than reported at others, though there were sufficient data to identify clear seasonal variation in these temporal profiles. Both gas phase reactions of NO3 and heterogeneous reaction of N2O5 were important at this site, with gas-phase reactions dominating in the early evening, just after sunset, and heterogeneous N2O5 uptake dominating later in the night.
Nakayama et al.117 reported CRDS measurements of N2O5 at an urban/suburban site in Toyokawa, Japan during four nights in February of 2006. The relatively modest (20 pptv) observed maximum mixing ratios were determined in part by the occasional presence of NO at the site, which limited the development of nighttime chemistry. During periods with low NO, they used a steady state analysis to estimate a nocturnal NOx loss rate of 0.5 pptv per night. A box model analysis suggested that gas phase loss of NO3 was also important at this site.
2.4 Power plant plumes
Electric power generation from fossil fuel combustion (coal and/or natural gas) is a large source of nitrogen oxide emissions (18% in the U.S. in 2008, for example) and therefore of precursors to NO3 and N2O5. Nocturnal radical chemistry within these sources is difficult to characterize from ground-based measurements, however, because the emission typically occurs from a tall stack and does not mix to surface level within a stratified, nighttime boundary layer structure. Several recent aircraft measurements have specifically targeted these emissions and the nighttime chemistry that occurs within lofted plumes from large point sources. Using a balloon released near the point source to track the transport of the plume, Zaveri et al.179 carried out several aircraft measurements of nitrogen, sulphur and aerosol species within plumes from coal fired power plants in New England in 2002. They found evidence for particulate phase organic nitrates, suggesting the possible nighttime oxidation of biogenic VOCs to form aerosol within these plumes. Although they did not directly measure NO3 and N2O5, their model analysis of measured reactive nitrogen compounds showed that N2O5 hydrolysis was negligibly slow within the sampled plumes. Luria et al.165 also presented aircraft measurements of reactive nitrogen and sulphur species within power plant plumes sampled in Texas in 2005. Although these authors also did not report direct measurement of NO3 and N2O5, their conclusion was opposite to that of Zaveri et al., in that they found evidence for very rapid oxidation of reactive nitrogen at night through N2O5 hydrolysis.179 The difference between the two studies may be a consequence of the atmospheric variability in N2O5 hydrolysis described in Section 2.3. Brown et al.171 showed aircraft vertical profiles of plumes from coal-fired power plants in New England in 2004. These data, which included direct measurement of NO3 and N2O5, showed that the plumes were less than 100 m in depth, transported at an altitude of 200–300 m, most likely determined by their rise height. Typical plume widths were on the order of 1–2 km, much greater than their depth. Such “fanning plumes” are common for point source emissions within stable boundary layers.80 Plumes from different sources on different nights exhibited either rapid or slow hydrolysis of N2O5, consistent with the prior description of variability in N2O5 reactive uptake, and also consistent with the difference between the two previous studies.165,179 Brown et al.180 recently analysed a series of aircraft transects of nighttime plumes from coal-fired power plants from the 2006 Texas study. They found that mixing played an essential role in determining plume chemistry from these concentrated sources. The plume analysis was similar to that of Jones and Seinfeld,181 who examined the interaction of mixing and chemistry within an urban plume at night. Brown et al. found a clear difference between power plants with and without selective catalytic reduction (SCR) NOx emissions controls. An non-controlled plant emitted sufficient NOx to titrate all of the background ozone, leaving excess NO during transport that prevented the further oxidation of NOx to NO3 or N2O5. A controlled plant did not emit NO in excess of background ozone, and consequently had much more rapid nighttime NOx oxidation than the uncontrolled one. The effect amplifies that of the NOx control itself, leading to an even greater effective removal of NOx from the source.
2.5 Marine environments
There have been numerous field campaigns at coastal or island sites, or from ship-based measurements, that have included measurements of nighttime radicals. Some of these studies have been essentially urban in nature, and could as easily fit in Section 2.3 as this one. However, there are several processes specific to marine environments, including the nocturnal oxidation of DMS182 and the interaction of NO3 and N2O5 with sea salt aerosol,183 that warrant the grouping of these field efforts into their own section.
The first attempt to measure NO3 in a marine environment was the work of Platt and Perner,184 who reported, surprisingly, that NO3 was not measurable above the detection limit of their DOAS instrument at Loop Head, Ireland. Heintz et al. presented a long-term data set running from April, 1993–June 1994 on the island of Rügen in the Baltic Sea. The 7 km light path for their DOAS NO3 measurements ran along the coastline at the northernmost point of this island. They observed NO3 mixing ratios up to 100 pptv, with an average of 7.8 pptv for the entire data set, with NO3 production rates generally in the range of a few tenths of ppbv h−1. Calculated N2O5 mixing ratios were much larger, with an average of 1 ppbv. Lifetimes of NO3 and N2O5 spanned a range of 5 s–1.4 hours, and 0.2–5.6 hours, respectively. The average NO3 lifetime was 250 s. From the anticorrelation of NO3 lifetime with NO2, and from the comparison of NO3 losses to the observed levels of DMS, these authors inferred that reaction of NO3 with DMS was unimportant at this site, but that N2O5 hydrolysis was a dominant loss mechanism for NO3 and N2O5. Martinez et al.185 reported measurements from a similar but somewhat more polluted site, the island of Helgoland in the North Sea, during October 1996. In these more limited duration measurements, the NO3 production rate varied up to 1.1 ppbv h−1, with NO3 mixing ratios up to 40 pptv and NO3 lifetimes generally below 1000 s (16 min). They also observed an anticorrelation of the NO3 lifetime with NO2, implying that N2O5 reactive uptake was a dominant loss mechanism for NO3 and N2O5, similar to the conclusion of Heintz et al.186 Although they did not have a measurement of DMS, they concluded from the likely flux of DMS that it was not a large enough NO3 sink to explain observed lifetimes. Using measured aerosol surface area data from a particle counter, they compared the observed lifetimes to those predicted for different N2O5 uptake coefficients, γ(N2O5), concluding that that majority of their lifetime data fell in a range of uptake coefficients from 0.04–0.1, somewhat higher than is currently accepted,24 but consistent with the understanding at the time.187,188
Measurements of NO3 and DMS over Biscayne Bay, Florida in 1989 by Yvon et al.28 showed NO3 levels from 10–40 pptv on several occasions, with some data below the 2 pptv instrumental detection limit of the DOAS instrument. The light path ran mainly over water, between an island and the mainland, and measured NO3 was compared to in situ DMS measurements at one end of the light path. The authors reported characteristic NO3 lifetimes of 1 and 6 minutes in marine and urban influenced air, respectively. They also observed a strong anticorrelation between NO3 and DMS. Although the observation was suggestive of a strong sink for DMS by reaction with NO3, the authors were unable to rule out transport effects as an explanation for the anticorrelation. They also suggested N2O5 reactive uptake as a major indirect sink for NO3. Later NO3 measurements by the same research group at the Weybourne observatory on the east coast of England in the spring of 1994 showed conclusively that DMS was a controlling factor for the lifetime of NO3, which was up to 18 minutes in marine influenced air. Measurements of peroxy radicals also showed their interaction with NO3 at night, as described further in Section 3.
Allan et al.26 reported a more extensive analysis of seasonal measurements of NO3 in 1994 and 1995 at the same site. In winter, the average NO3 mixing ratio and lifetime were 10 pptv and 2.4 minutes, respectively, in semi-polluted air. In summer, a cleaner period at this site, NO3 mixing ratios and lifetimes were 6 pptv and 7.2 minutes. A box model analysis showed that the major loss in winter was N2O5 hydrolysis, while in summer, reaction of NO3 with elevated concentrations of DMS within marine air masses was the most important loss. Extrapolation of the box model analysis to more remote regions suggested that the nocturnal oxidation of DMS by NO3 reaction should dominate the total loss of this species for any air mass in which NO2 was more than 1.6 times the level of DMS. Allan et al.189 also reported DOAS-based measurements of NO3 in the remote marine boundary layer during two campaigns at Mace Head, on the west coast of Ireland in 1996 and 1997, and a separate campaign on the island of Tenerife, east of North Africa, in 1997. At Mace Head, NO3 levels of 1–40 pptv were measured in semi-polluted air, with levels up to 5 pptv in clean marine air. Lifetimes of NO3 were variable, from less than 2 minutes to greater than 4 hours. There was less variability at Tenerife, with NO3 from 1–20 pptv with a lifetime of 4–34 minutes. In semi-polluted air masses of continental origin, N2O5 uptake was the dominant loss, while in marine influenced air masses, the most important sink was reaction of NO3 with DMS. The latter was responsible for 80–90% of the loss at Tenerife. These authors confirmed their previous finding that NO3 reaction could dominate over OH as a loss for DMS over wide areas of the Atlantic Ocean. Salisbury et al.66 also reported DOAS-based NO3 measurements at Mace Head in the spring of 1997, taken simultaneously with detailed measurements of peroxy radicals. These authors also found evidence of an important role of NO3 reaction with DMS, as described further in Section 3.
Saiz-Lopez et al.190 also reported DOAS measurements of NO3 from Mace Head during the NAMBLEX campaign in July and August 2002. Observed levels were similar to previous campaigns, ranging to 20 pptv. The campaign also included DOAS measurements of reactive iodine species such as I2, IO and OIO, with the latter species observed at night. A model analysis suggested that the reaction of NO3 with I2 was the source of the iodine oxides. Measurements of NO3 vertical profiles by zenith sky DOAS at sunrise found gradients that suggested the loss of NO3 by its reaction with DMS at surface level. Mahajan et al.191 made similar DOAS measurements of both NO3 and reactive iodine species at a coastal site in Roscoff, France in 2006. They showed up to 70 pptv NO3 along with both IO and OIO at night and used a box model to analyse the importance of NO3 reaction with both I2 and IO in producing these species.
Shon et al.192 presented a model of NO3 chemistry on Jeju Island, south of Korea, for spring 2001 based on measurements of NO, NO3, O3, DMS and aerosols. Their focus was primarily on the effect of Asian dust storms at this island site, which significantly increased the rate of N2O5 reactive uptake through an increase in aerosol surface area. During these events, modelled NO3 mixing ratios were smaller by a factor of 2–3, as were DMS oxidation rates. Indeed, measured DMS levels increased during dust storm events, consistent with a smaller loss rate by NO3 reaction.
Vrekoussis et al.193–195 reported DOAS based measurements from a series of campaigns at Finokalia station on the island of Crete in the Mediterranean. During the MINOS campaign in the summer of 2001,193 NO3 mixing ratios ranged from the 1 pptv detection limit to 38 pptv, with an average level at midnight of 6 pptv (Fig. 5). Average NO3 lifetimes were in the range 1–6 minutes. The campaign included measurements of both NO3 and OH for comparison of daytime and nighttime loss rates of both DMS and total reactive nitrogen. There was a distinct minimum in the DMS mixing ratio at night associated with the presence of NO3, with approximately 43% of the total DMS loss occurring by reaction with NO3. Reactions of NO3 and N2O5 accounted for 21% of the total conversion of NOx to soluble nitrate, evenly split between N2O5 reactive uptake and reaction of NO3 with DMS. These measurements were extended beyond the summer 2001 field intensive to produce a 2 year data set running to 2003.194,195 Seasonally averaged NO3 was highest in summer, at 5.6 pptv, and lowest in winter, at 1.2 pptv, with the highest levels found in polluted air masses transported from Greece, Turkey and central Europe. An important role for N2O5 hydrolysis was inferred from the negative correlation of the NO3 lifetime with NO2. The slope of this correlation increased with relative humidity, indicating that N2O5 hydrolysis was more important during humid periods, consistent with its uptake to hygroscopic aerosol. Across all seasons, these authors found that reaction of NO3 accounted for 50–65% of all oxidation of NOx to soluble nitrate, much larger than the 21% found for the summertime study. The reaction of NO3 with DMS was responsible for some 17% of the total soluble nitrate formation.

Several island and ship-based measurements during the New England Air Quality Studies during the summers of 2002 and 2004 investigated nighttime radical chemistry, VOC oxidation and loss pathways for NOx. Warneke et al.196 compared daytime and nighttime oxidation rates for a variety of VOCs measured on the R/V Ronald H. Brown during NEAQS 2002. A variety of both anthropogenic and biogenic VOCs were transported over water to the ship based measurements. Monoterpene species were preferentially removed by reaction with NO3, while both NO3 and OH removed isoprene approximately equally despite its predominantly daytime emissions. Anthropogenic and oxygenated VOCs, by contrast, were primarily oxidized by OH, even in the case of reactive alkenes, such as propene. DMS, the only VOC not transported to the ship but emitted in the marine environment, was principally oxidized by NO3. Stark et al. presented a more in depth analysis of the DMS oxidation,27 including a model to measurement comparison of the diurnal variation of DMS and its oxidants. The analysis showed that between 65–90% of the total DMS oxidation was due to NO3, depending on the ship's location and the corresponding NO3 mixing ratios. Like the previous work by Allan et al.,26,189 these authors suggested that the dominance of NO3 oxidation of DMS could extend for as much as 3000 km from the coastal pollution sources as NOx is transported across more remote areas of the ocean. Using data from the following New England Study in 2004, in which the R/V Brown sampled a much wider region further from the U.S. coastline, Osthoff et al.197 tested this hypothesis by examining the regional variation of DMS oxidation. They found that nighttime DMS oxidation rates did indeed fall off with distance from the coast, but remained comparable to daytime, OH-driven oxidation, even at the furthest distance sampled by the ship. They also suggested that the major impact of nighttime DMS oxidation in a polluted region would be to suppress vertical transport of marine sulphur out of the boundary layer at night, thus impacting the dry-deposition lifetime of oxidized sulphur or aerosol species formed upon DMS oxidation.
Aldener et al.198 reported NO3 and N2O5 measured by CRDS from the R/V Brown during NEAQS 2002, along with the major loss processes for these nighttime nitrogen oxides. Mixing ratios of NO3 and N2O5 varied up to 140 pptv and 1.6 ppbv, respectively. Typical lifetimes were a few minutes up to a maximum of 30 minutes for NO3, and 20 minutes up to a maximum of 70 minutes for N2O5. An N2O5 uptake coefficient of γ(N2O5) = 0.03 produced reasonable agreement between measured lifetimes and those calculated from the instantaneous losses of NO3 and N2O5 to reaction with VOCs and aerosol uptake, respectively. Although the ship sampled across a range of environments in which different loss mechanisms were variable from one night to the next, the average NO3 and N2O5 losses included 47% to N2O5 hydrolysis, and 25%, 19%, 7% and 2% to NO3 reaction with DMS, terrestrial biogenic VOCs, anthropogenic VOCs and heterogeneous uptake (uptake coefficient, γ(NO3) = 0.004199), respectively. Ambrose et al.200 undertook a similar analysis of DOAS-based NO3 data from an island site off the coast of New Hampshire during the 2004 NEAQS campaign (Fig. 6). Mixing ratios of NO3 varied up to 80 pptv. These authors also produced a loss budget for NO3 and N2O5 that included the direct, gas phase reaction of N2O5 with water, including both a linear and quadratic dependence of the rate coefficient on water vapour.201 This reaction contributed 53% of the total NO3 and N2O5 loss in their budget. Reduction of this reaction by a factor of 2.9169 produced a loss budget in which the heterogeneous and gas phase reactions of N2O5 were responsible for 50% and 16% of the total loss, respectively. Gas phase reactions of NO3 were 34–37% of the budget for either assumption. Diurnally averaged NOx loss was 11 ppbv day−1, with nighttime reactions responsible for approximately half of this loss. Using the master chemical mechanism (MCM) box model,202 Sommariva et al.203 analysed ship-based measurements of NO3 and N2O5 from NEAQS 2004, which showed a range of NO3 mixing ratios up to 36 pptv. Model to measurement comparisons were consistent with a value of γ(N2O5) > 0.01, in agreement with the Aldener et al.198 analysis. The model did not include N2O5 homogeneous reaction with water vapour. The model indicated that NO3 reactions with peroxy radicals, calculated from the MCM, were responsible for 15% of the total loss of NO3 and N2O5. Peroxy radical reactions were particularly important during periods with large amounts of both NO3 and DMS. Finally, Brown et al.171 demonstrated strong gradients in the vertical profiles of both DMS and NO3 over a coastal location in the state of Maine using aircraft measurements from NEAQS 2004. Below 500 m, DMS had a negative gradient with increasing height, while NO3 had a positive one, with the NO3 + DMS reaction responsible for the entire vertical gradient in the summed lifetime of NO3 and N2O5.

Measurements of NO3 and N2O5 by LIF were conducted on Izu-Oshima Island, a marine site in the outflow from Tokyo, Japan, in June 2004 by Matsumoto et al.204 Mixing ratios ranged up to 30 and 80 pptv for NO3 and N2O5, respectively. Absolute nocturnal NOx loss rates were found to be 1.8 and 0.2 ppbv per night for polluted and clean marine air masses, respectively. Gas phase reactions of NO3, especially with DMS, were primarily responsible for this loss.
Osthoff et al.32 analysed ship-based measurements of N2O5 and ClNO2 during the 2006 Texas Air Quality study, reporting CRDS-based N2O5 mixing ratios up to 0.8 ppbv in polluted areas along the U.S. Gulf coast and in the area near Houston, TX. Section 4.5 on halogen activation describes this measurement in more detail. McLaren et al.205 also focused on halogen activation processes in their analysis of DOAS-based NO3 measurements on Saturna Island, a polluted marine site south of Vancouver, British Columbia, in July and August 2005. Mixing ratios of measured NO3 and calculated N2O5 varied up to 60 pptv and 2.0 ppbv, respectively, with nightly averages of approximately 25 pptv and 0.3 ppbv, respectively. These authors developed an alternative analysis for steady state lifetimes to explicitly account for the time-dependent approach to steady state from the observed temporal variation in NO3 mixing ratios. Their τ(NO3) varied from 1–2 minutes; based on its variation against the N2O5 to NO3 ratio, they derived average loss rate coefficients for NO3 and N2O5 of 8.7 × 10−3 and 0.57 × 10−3 s−1, respectively. They also found that NO3 losses were more important early in the night, while those of N2O5 dominated near sunrise. Using a transport model and an estimate for the nightly integrated production of N2O5 over water, they suggested that nighttime ClNO2 formation could significantly impact downwind ozone mixing ratios measured in coastal locations of British Columbia on the following day.
2.6 Forest environments
Like field studies of nighttime radicals in marine environments, studies in forested environments have substantial overlap with those classified as urban in Section 2.3. The principal distinguishing process that is relevant in forested environments is the very rapid reaction of NO3 with biogenic hydrocarbons.25 These reactions with isoprene, monoterpenes and other biogenic hydrocarbons affect budgets for both the hydrocarbons and the reactive nitrogen, and may be a large source of secondary organic aerosol.36 They also represent an interaction between an anthropogenic pollutant (NO3), derived from NOx emissions, and natural emissions from the biosphere.
A number of studies have examined the nighttime disappearance of isoprene to infer the likely magnitude of reaction with either NO3 or O3 at night. These studies have largely been based on estimates for NO3 concentrations and its influence on nighttime oxidation. Goldan et al.206 analysed diurnal patterns in both isoprene and α-pinene mixing ratios measured at a forested site in Alabama, USA during the ROSES field program in the summer of 1990. They observed a nighttime decay of isoprene with a time constant of approximately 4 hours, although they could not justify this loss as being due to reaction with either O3 or NO3, even though there was sufficient nighttime NO2 (2.7 ppbv) to sustain P(NO3) at approximately 0.2 ppbv h−1. Similarly, Biesenthal et al.207 reported nighttime decay of isoprene at a forested site in eastern Canada with a time constant of 1–3 hours, apparently not attributable to transport or chemistry. Starn et al.208 measured large nighttime levels of isoprene at a site in Tennessee during the 1995 Southern Oxidants Study (SOS), observing rapid isoprene decays after dark that could be attributed to chemical loss via reaction with NO3 during periods when both NO2 and O3 were elevated. Hurst et al.209 also found rapid (τ = 2.7 hours) nighttime isoprene loss at a site in rural northern Michigan during the PROPHET campaign in 1998. They interpreted the loss as the combination of chemical loss and transport, with nighttime OH generation an important factor. Later analysis indicated that transport, particularly in the vertical, was an important component determining this loss.210,211 Steinbacher et al.212 analysed the diurnal cycle in isoprene in the Po river valley in Italy and found that rapid, early evening loss was consistent with chemical degradation via NO3. Bartenbach et al.213 estimated early evening NO3 mixing ratios near 6 pptv based on observed diurnal profiles in biogenic hydrocarbons at the Hohenpeisenberg observatory in Germany.
There is also evidence for NO3 oxidation of monoterpenes from VOC measurements and from models. Ljungström and Hallquist214 calculated NO3 production rates in Scandinavia and suggested that the primary factor controlling NO3 consumption would be reactions with biogenic hydrocarbons. Ambient aerosol samples collected at a forested site in Bavaria, Germany were found to contain nitroxy–organosulfates that were only elevated at night, suggesting gas-phase NO3 oxidation followed by reaction of the organic nitrate in the aerosol phase.215 During the BEARPEX 2009 campaign at a forested site in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, Beaver et al.216 reported an α-pinene nitrate compound that peaked in the early evening, again indicating NO3 oxidation of monoterpenes. Modelling studies have also suggested NO3 as an important oxidant for monoterpenes, and to a lesser extent isoprene, within the forest canopy during daytime. These models, based on field measurements in the U.S. and Europe, find daytime NO3 oxidation important due to reduced light levels within a canopy and to high reactivity of biogenic VOCs with respect to NO3.217,218
Nitrate radical measurements are key to testing these hypotheses about its role in biogenic VOC oxidation, but such studies are fewer in number than the indirect studies listed above. Mihelcic et al.7 measured NO3 and peroxy radicals simultaneously with an in situ ESR instrument at a site in the Black Forest of Germany in August, 1990. They modelled the observed 5–10 pptv NO3 mixing ratios in terms of reaction with α-pinene, but the model was unconstrained by observed biogenic VOC measurements. The studies of Geyer et al.63,174 during the BERLIOZ experiment at a forested site outside of Berlin have been described in Section 2.3, but show the potential for rapid nitrate radical oxidation of VOCs, especially olefins, in relation to other oxidants averaged over a 24 hour cycle (Fig. 7). DOAS measurements of NO3 levels at this site were significant, as was their role in biogenic VOC oxidation. Integrated over a 24 hour period, NO3 radicals were found to contribute 31% of the total oxidation of alkenes, which were dominated by biogenics. Gölz and co-workers219,220 measured NO3 radicals by DOAS at an eucalyptus forest site in Portugal during the FIELDVOC campaign in June and July 1994. They were unable to measure NO3 above the 6 pptv detection limit of the instrument despite substantial production rates varying up to P(NO3) = 0.4 ppbv h−1. They did observe peroxy radicals, positively correlated with P(NO3), suggestive of NO3 contribution to nighttime oxidation, but the observed RO2 were much smaller than predicted with a chemical box model that included reactions of NO3 with biogenic VOCs. A combination of isoprene, and α- and β-pinene limited the nighttime NO3 lifetime to values of approximately 20 s (loss frequency of 0.05 s−1), dominating by far over other NO3 losses such as heterogeneous N2O5 uptake.

Stroud et al.221 were able to quantify the contribution of chemical losses to the early evening decay of isoprene at a forested site in Tennessee in June and July 1999 during the Southern Oxidant Study. The study included DOAS-based NO3 along multiple light paths spanning an altitude range up to 75 m. Substantial vertical gradients were sometimes apparent in the data, complicating the oxidation budgets of in situ VOCs with DOAS NO3. Nighttime first order loss rate coefficients of isoprene with respect to NO3 were comparable to, or larger than, daytime loss rate coefficients against OH oxidation, although isoprene normally decayed within the first few hours after sunset. Reaction with NO3 was important to the chemical budget of isoprene, and was responsible for the nighttime decay in several instances. McLaren et al.222 measured NO3 by long path DOAS at a rural/forested site in the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia. The DOAS path spanned an altitude range from the valley floor to a point 250 m above it, likely traversing through and out of the nocturnal boundary layer. Measured NO3 varied up to 45 pptv, presuming its concentration to be well-mixed across the entire light path. The authors interpreted the measurements largely in terms of the potential of N2O5 to form particulate nitrate, which was enhanced at night in fine particulate samples collected at the upper end of the DOAS path. However, the authors also reported the presence of pinonaldehyde, an oxidation product of α-pinene, substantially enhanced in nighttime particulate phase samples.
Analysis of aircraft measurements during the NEAQS 2004 campaign in the northeast U.S. showed nighttime isoprene and NO3 within the residual daytime boundary layer to be strongly anticorrelated.18 Measured NO3 aloft varied up to 350 pptv, while measured isoprene varied up to 1.2 ppbv after dark. Using the isoprene oxidation products, methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) and methacrolein (MACR) as tracers for the presence of isoprene in air masses at sunset, these authors found that up to 20% of emitted isoprene was oxidized by NO3 radical reaction, and that isoprene nitrates from this reaction were 2–9% of total reactive nitrogen. Estimated organic aerosol from the NO3 + isoprene reaction was 1–17% of the total. Crowley et al.223 presented NO3 and N2O5 measurements from a two channel CRDS instrument at a rural mountaintop site in southwest Germany in May of 2008. They found NO3 in the range 20–40 pptv on most nights, with N2O5 varying up to 500 pptv. Production rates for NO3 and steady-state lifetimes were remarkably consistent, with values of 0.1–0.4 ppbv h−1 and 10–15 minutes, respectively. Although biogenic VOCs were not measured as part of the campaign, a lifetime analysis showed that direct loss of NO3, presumably to reaction with VOC, was much more important than indirect loss via N2O5 uptake to aerosol. Nighttime NOx loss rates were also compared to those from photochemical oxidation of NO2 by OH, with nighttime processes comparable to, but generally smaller than, daytime NOx oxidation.
2.7 Polar regions
There are relatively few direct measurements of NO3 or N2O5 at high latitudes in the troposphere. A defining feature of this environment is the prevalence of darkness for long periods during winter. Global model studies (Section 4) indicate that N2O5 hydrolysis is the predominant mechanism (>80%) for NOx loss in high latitude winter. Cold temperatures tend to amplify this effect, both by increasing the ratio of N2O5 to NO3 through their temperature dependent equilibrium, potentially increasing the N2O5 uptake coefficient (see Section 4.2) and by suppressing the absolute concentration of water vapour and thus the production rate for OH radicals that oxidize NO2 to HNO3 during daytime.224
Simpson and co-workers have carried out a series of studies in the area near Fairbanks, Alaska. Ayers and Simpson225 and Simpson115 measured N2O5 with a CRDS instrument at a site located on the University of Alaska campus in Fairbanks in December 2002 and February 2004. Mixing ratios of N2O5 during the two measurement periods varied through a few tens to a few hundreds of pptv during the December and February periods, respectively (Fig. 8). Using carbon monoxide (CO) as a proxy for NOx emissions, they found a clear anticorrelation between CO and O3 attributable to titration of background O3 by the urban plume of Fairbanks. Background ozone was in the range 30–40 ppbv. The correlation of CO with NOx from a separate set of measurements provided an estimate of NO2, which was used in turn to derive the steady state lifetime of N2O5, τ(N2O5). Values of τ(N2O5) sharply peaked around 3 minutes for the December 2002 study, and were more broadly distributed with the largest number of measurements near 10 minutes. Lifetimes of N2O5 were very short compared to the lifetime of NO2 oxidation by O3 under the conditions of this study, which was on the order of 25 hours. Thus, N2O5 reaction was inferred to be rapid, but the overall NOx oxidation rate under cold, low O3 conditions, was still rather slow. The authors noted the confounding factor of mixing within stratified wintertime arctic boundary layer, whose time scale was likely important to quantifying these processes. Apodaca et al.226 reported N2O5 measured at a site further downwind of Fairbanks during November of 2007. Mixing ratios of N2O5 varied up to 100 pptv, and O3 was frequently titrated to near zero levels, with NO2 varying up to approximately 20 ppbv. The lifetime of N2O5 was much longer than reported in their previous study, with values as large as τ(N2O5) = 100 minutes. However, during periods when the relative humidity with respect to ice was above 100%, mean N2O5 lifetimes fell precipitously, from 20 to 6 minutes. They suggested that ice, either in the form of suspended particles or the snowpack itself, were likely to be an important loss for N2O5 due to their ubiquity at high latitude. Finally, Huff et al.227 presented measurements of N2O5 gradients above snowpack at a site downwind of Fairbanks in November of 2009. Using a movable inlet that could be positioned either 2.35 or 0.95 m above ground level, they observed clear, near-surface gradients in N2O5, which varied through mixing ratios of a few tens of pptv. They derived a distribution of deposition velocities of N2O5 to snow ranging between 0–1.5 cm s−1, with an average value of 0.6 cm s−1. This is the only reported deposition velocity for N2O5. They estimated that such dry deposition losses would be responsible for at least 1/8 of the total chemical loss of N2O5 in that environment.

2.8 The free troposphere
There are a handful of NO3 and N2O5 measurements in the free troposphere. Most of these come from passive DOAS measurements, as described in Section 2.1, although a few are from in situ or LP-DOAS instruments. Noxon228 reported the first column measurements of free tropospheric NO3. They used moonlight at lunar zenith angles between 89–91° to derive trace gas absorption specific to the altitude range 3 ± 0.5 km. The asymmetry in the measurements over this range of angles allowed separation of the stratospheric and tropospheric components. Mean NO3 mixing ratios were small, approximately 0.3 pptv, and approximately 1% of the mean NO2 mixing ratio of 30 pptv. The authors anticipated a much larger nighttime ratio of NO3 to NO2, especially since the calculated N2O5 was nearly negligible at these NO2 levels and temperature (285 K). They speculated about potential sinks for NO3 in the free troposphere. However, later work by Solomon et al.13 pointed to a problem with correction of water vapour absorption from the spectra and brought models and measurements in to closer agreement. Smith et al.229 used the time dependence of lunar column absorption during sunrise to derive vertical profiles of NO3 at both midlatitude (Fritz Peak, Colorado, 40 °N) and Antarctica (McMurdo Station). They found roughly half of the total column to arise from the troposphere at mid-latitude, but a negligible contribution in Antarctica. Aliwell and Jones230 also found larger column NO3 in midlatitude measurements of lunar light than could be explained from a stratospheric model alone, but did not attribute the difference to the free troposphere. Chen et al.151 also found substantial NO3 in excess of that attributable to the stratospheric column in their lunar measurements from the Table Mountain site above Los Angeles, also at midlatitude. They suggested a large component of column NO3 from a free tropospheric source.
Allan et al.93 presented NO3 vertical profiles from column scattered sunlight measurements at sunrise at four locations in both the northern (Mace Head, Ireland, Weybourne, England, and Tenerife, Canary Islands) and southern (Cape Grim, Tasmania) hemispheres (Fig. 9). In some cases, these were augmented by boundary layer measurements using LP-DOAS. They suggested that a significant fraction of the total tropospheric NO3 column is present in the free troposphere or upper boundary layer, with considerable day to day variability. Von Friedeburg103 measured scattered sunlight spectra of NO3 during sunrise near Heidelberg, Germany, which they combined with a radiative transfer and photochemical model. Their analysis showed an enriched layer of NO3 above surface level, although two solutions were possible, one that placed the layer at 350 m, and the other at 2.5 km above ground level. They suggested the former to be the most probable, with the NO3 maximum near the top of the nocturnal boundary layer rather than in the free troposphere. They derived an NO3 mixing ratio range of 40–360 pptv within this layer, compared to a model showing 240 pptv.

Carslaw et al.145 measured NO3 in May 1994 by LP-DOAS at an elevated site (2.3 km) on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. They found 8 pptv average and 20 pptv maximum NO3 mixing ratios, with no evidence for an unaccounted NO3 sink. Sampled air had very low relative humidity and aerosol particle count. The τ(NO3) was in excess of 2 hours, considerably longer than boundary layer measurements, but was likely a lower limit to the actual NO3 lifetime because of the time required to approach steady state. Brown et al.171 showed aircraft vertical profiles of NO3 and N2O5 to 3.2 km during the NEAQS 2004 campaign. Within the free troposphere above 1.5 km, the NO3 mixing ratio of a few pptv exceeded that of N2O5 and gave a steady state summed lifetime, τSUM, of approximately 1 hour, dominated by NO3 at high altitude. The observed lifetime was likely a lower limit to the actual lifetime.
2.9 The stratosphere
As noted in the introduction, heterogeneous hydrolysis of N2O5 is extremely important to the NOx and O3 budgets of the stratosphere, as demonstrated, for example by in situ measurements of the partitioning between different components of reactive nitrogen from balloons and high altitude aircraft.40,231 Direct measurements of stratospheric NO3 and N2O5, however, have been exclusively performed using remote sensing techniques. The lunar occultation NO3 measurements of Noxon et al.4 found a column abundance, i.e. the vertically integrated atmospheric concentration, of 1 ± 0.2 × 1014 cm−2, in agreement with the expectations from known stratospheric chemistry. The same technique was also employed to derive the first ground-based long-term observations of NO3 column at mid-latitudes which showed column densities of 1.5−8 × 1013 cm−2.232 Further studies in mid-latitude and polar regions concluded that the NO3 column density depends on solar illumination and temperature, the latter due to the dependence of NO3 formation through reaction (R1.1). Motivated by the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole, column measurements in polar regions also provided a better understanding of NOx chemistry and the removal of gas-phase NO2 in the presence of polar stratospheric clouds.233,234
Ground-based remote sensing measurements during sunrise also allowed the retrieval of NO3 concentration profiles, which showed a maximum of ∼2.6 × 107 molecule cm−3 around 35 km altitude.100 These observations confirmed early balloon-borne stellar occultation measurement3 of mid-latitudinal stratospheric NO3 concentration profiles with a maximum of 3.5 ± 0.4 × 107 molecule cm−3 at 35 km altitude. All of these studies and the associated chemistry modelling efforts concluded that NO3 is in a steady state with O3, NO2 and N2O5 and that its concentration is strongly dependent on NOx levels, solar radiation, temperature, and the presence of stratospheric aerosol.
Most recently the global distribution of stratospheric NO3 has been measured using the space-borne Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS) instrument.235 The long-term measurements showed a maximum NO3 mixing ratio at 40–45 km altitude with values of 250–300 pptv in spring and summer for latitudes higher than 35° and maxima of 200–250 pptv during the solar equinoxes at latitudes lower than 35°. Lower stratospheric (below 30 km) mixing ratios are in the range of 20–40 pptv. Total NO3 column densities (Fig. 10) are found to be below 2 × 1013 cm−2 during the polar fall and winter and up to 4 × 1013 cm−2 in the spring and summer. This behaviour is linked to upper stratospheric temperatures. At lower latitudes a bi-annual maximum of ∼3.5 × 1013 cm−2 is found during March and September.

N2O5 absorptions can be detected by thermal or solar occultation infrared spectroscopy. These are mostly performed from balloon-borne and space-borne instruments. Roscoe236 provided the first tentative measurement of ∼1 ppbv of N2O5 at 35 km altitude from a balloon, followed by similar measurements yielding peak N2O5 mixing ratios of 1.8 ppbv,237 1–2.5 ppbv238 and 2.06 ppbv.239 A number of other balloon borne observations have since confirmed that stratospheric N2O5 mixing ratios show a maximum between 25–35 km altitude with a value between 1–2 ppbv decreasing to mixing ratios of 0.1 ppbv or lower below 20 km altitude.58,240
The ATMOS instrument on Spacelab III was the first space borne instrument able to measure N2O5 in solar occultation.241,242 These measurements shed light on the diurnal behaviour of N2O5, which, at mid-latitudes, accumulates throughout the night to 1.6 ppbv at 30 km altitude and photolyzes throughout the day to levels around 0.1 ppbv at sunset.243 The ATMOS instrument was and is followed by a number of other satellite instruments, including CLAES-UARS/ISAMS-UARS,244 CRISTA,59 ILAS I & II, MIPAS,245 ACE-FTS,246 HIRDLS.247 In short, the satellite observations show similar vertical N2O5 distributions as the balloon observations and also clearly show the nocturnal accumulation and daytime photolysis of N2O5.
2.10 Indoor air
Indoor air quality has attracted attention recently due to the potentially larger exposure of people to air pollutants within buildings and residences compared to outside. Of particular importance to the discussion of indoor air quality is the potential for NO3 and N2O5 to contribute to indoor air chemistry and pollutant formation. The relevance of these compounds stems, in part, from the time scale for their formation and loss, which is thought to be comparable to the residence time of air within structures. For example, Weschler et al.248 analysed measurements that showed enhanced HNO3 indoors relative to outside in the Boston Area. They found from a mass balance approach that the reaction of NO2 with O3 was sufficient to explain the HNO3 measurements, although they attributed HNO3 formation to NO3 reactions, even though these reactions often do not produce HNO3. A more likely explanation is heterogeneous N2O5 uptake. These authors also analysed the potential for nitrate and other radical reactions to produce aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, organic nitrates and peroxyacetyl nitrates indoors.249 The concern is that some of these species are known irritants. Zhang et al.250 also examined the potential for production of carbonyl compounds indoors, implicating the slow reaction of NO3 with formaldehyde as a potential source of formic acid. Ingrosso251 also speculated on the potential role of free radicals, including NO3, indoors. Nøjgaard et al.252 examined the ozonolysis of monoterpenes in a Teflon chamber to understand the importance of this reaction as a source of indoor particulate matter. They found that the presence of NO2, which consumed O3 to produce NO3, inhibited particle nucleation and would lead to less indoor particulate production. This finding is in conflict with other studies suggesting larger organic aerosol yields from NO3 reactions with monoterpenes.253 The only published attempt to measure NO3 radicals indoors was the work of Nøjgaard,254 who measured a unique oxidation product of the reaction of NO3 with added cyclohexane in a flow tube. The study found NO3 + N2O5 mixing ratios up to 58 pptv, with N2O5 being the dominant species. The authors indicated the need for further indoor measurements to quantify these compounds.
2.11 Daytime NO3 and N2O5
Although NO3 and N2O5 are largely present at night, there have been a few limited attempts to quantify their mixing ratios and impacts at surface level during daytime. In the upper atmosphere, or in polar environments, N2O5 is a daytime species due to its reduced thermal dissociation at low temperature and its slow photochemical degradation. Geyer et al.52 measured daytime NO3 by LP-DOAS in August, 2000 at a site near Houston during the Texas Air Quality Study. In the 3 hours prior to sunset on three consecutive measurement days, they found NO3 levels growing from 5 pptv to a maximum of 31 pptv at sunset (Fig. 11). Brown et al.255 measured daytime NO3 and N2O5 by CRDS from aircraft during the 2004 NEAQS campaign. On two separate flights, they found levels of NO3 of approximately 0.5 pptv near mid day, and N2O5 up to approximately 8 pptv 3 hours prior to sunset. Osthoff et al.256 reported CRDS-based daytime N2O5 from a ship during the same campaign, with N2O5 levels of 2 pptv within NOx plumes near midday, and 4 pptv near sunset.
 Fig. 11  Three days of measurements of NO3, its first-order loss rate coefficient to photolysis (JNO3), O3, Ox (= O3 + NO2), NO and NO2 near Houston, Texas, USA, in 2000. NO3 grew rapidly during daylight hours in the late afternoon.52 Reprinted with permission from the Journal of Geophysical Research. 
All of these authors found limited but non-negligible impact for these daytime levels. For example, during daytime, NO3 and N2O5 participate in chemical cycles that slightly perturb the photostationary state between NO and NO2,257 altering this ratio by a typical value of 0.5%, with a maximum of 5%. The minor channel in the photolysis of NO3 that produces NO rather than O2 results in catalytic destruction of ozone. The maximum O3 destruction rate due to this mechanism was 0.1 ppbv h−1 for the NEAQS aircraft data, a small number in comparison to the several ppbv h−1 O3 production rates normally associated with NOx plumes during daytime. Heterogeneous uptake of N2O5 during daytime was also found to increase the rate of photochemical NO2 oxidation by several percent. Daytime NO3 may also oxidize biogenic VOCs or marine sulphur. Maximum daytime NO3 + α-pinene oxidation rates determined from aircraft during NEAQS 2004 were on the order of 10 pptv h−1, although the low oxidation rates were due in part to low monoterpene levels measured at aircraft altitude. Within the marine boundary layer, the effect of daytime NO3 was more pronounced for DMS oxidation, with 10–40% of DMS oxidized by NO3 during daytime for some conditions.
Models of photochemistry within forest canopies have also found an important role for daytime NO3 in the oxidation of biogenic VOCs, as described in Section 2.6.217,218 There are no NO3 measurements to validate these daytime canopy model calculations.
3. Atmospheric chemistry of NO3
In many environments the nitrate radical is the dominant nocturnal oxidant. As discussed in the introduction, the most important chemical reaction partners of NO3 are NOx, biogenic VOC's, DMS, and aerosol particles. In addition, NO3 can form other nocturnal radical species and lead to the formation and growth of particles. Each of these chemical systems will be discussed below. The reaction of NO3 with NO2, which leads to the formation of N2O5, and the chemistry of N2O5 will be discussed separately in Section 4.
3.1 Reactions of NO3 with VOC
A number of review articles have summarized the kinetics of NO3 + VOC reactions in recent years.74,258 We will thus limit this review to the general discussion of this topic and point out recent developments in this area. It should be noted that only a few NO3 + VOC reactions are included in the common kinetic data compilation and that much of the available data has not been critically reviewed.
Reactions of NO3 with saturated hydrocarbons proceed by H-atom abstraction forming an alkyl radical and HNO3. Rate constants are typically smaller than 3 × 10−16 cm3 molecule−1 s−1259 and thus unimportant compared to reactions of OH. Reactions of NO3 with alkenes proceed predominately by addition to the carbon double bond. While the rates for NO3 reactions with smaller (C < 3) alkenes are quite low, the rates increase for larger alkenes so that, in a 24 h period, the nocturnal reaction with NO3 can become an important factor in their budget. In particular the reactions with biogenic VOCs are rapid, with a rate of 7 × 10−13 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for isoprene at 298 K and rates in the range of 6 × 10−13–1.4 × 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for the various terpenes. Table 1 gives a brief overview over the range of NO3 reaction rates and typical lifetimes for various types of VOCs. For a more detailed compilation the reader is referred to Atkinson.258

The significance of NO3 for the budget of hydrocarbons has been observed in various field experiments (see Sections 2 and 2.5). A common way of assessing the importance of NO3vs. OH and O3 reactions is to use averaged radical concentrations, daytime and nighttime periods, and calculate the VOC lifetime for the VOC + radical reactions. We refer the reader to Atkinson258 for such a table. However, it should be mentioned that these tables are somewhat misleading as, in contrast to OH, NO3 does not undergo recycling upon reaction with VOC. Consequently, high levels of VOCs lead to a reduction of NO3 levels, and an increase of the lifetime of the VOC.
The reaction products of alkenes with NO3 are fairly well understood.74 The nitroxyalkyl radical, which is formed in the initial H-atom addition, can rapidly react with O2 forming a nitroxyalkyl-peroxy radical (RH–ONO2–O2) or thermally decompose. In the absence of NO, which is most likely the case if NO3 is present, the nitroxyalkyl-peroxy radical can react with NO2, NO3, HO2, and other peroxy radicals. The reaction with NO2 leads to the formation of thermally unstable nitrooxy peroxynitrates.260,261 The reaction with other peroxy radicals leads to the formation of hydroperoxy-nitrates, hydroxy-nitrates, nitroxy-aldehydes/-ketones, and nitroxy-alkoxy radicals.260–262 The latter can then decompose to aldehydes/ketones, react with NO2 to form an alkyl di-nitrate, and react with O2 to form nitrooxy-aldehydes/-ketones.260
The importance of the different reaction channels of the nitroxyalkyl-peroxy radical, RO2, in the real atmosphere is currently not clearly established. This is in part due to the poorly known RO2 rate constants. It appears that the RO2 + HO2 is not significant.263 Kirchner and Stockwell264 conclude from their modelling study that RO2 + NO3 reactions are more important in the nighttime atmosphere than RO2 + RO2 reactions, while Bey et al.265 reached the opposite conclusion. It should be added that most of the laboratory studies have been performed with only one VOC and thus a limited number of different RO2 species. The atmospheric fate of the nitroxyalkyl-peroxy radical remains thus poorly understood.
Of particular interest are the final reaction products of these reaction sequences, in particular for the more reactive, larger alkenes, dienes, and terpenes. The final reaction products of 1,3-butadiene were ∼60% organic nitrates and small amounts (∼5%) of acrolein and HCHO.260,266,267
Because of the importance of isoprene as the dominant biogenic VOC, several laboratory and theoretical studies263,266,268–271 have investigated the isoprene + NO3 reaction mechanism. The reaction proceeds by the addition of NO3 to the carbon double bond with the attack on the 1 position favoured 3.5:1 over that at the 4 position.266,268,270 The nitrooxyalkyl radicals react with O2 to form RO2 radicals. These can then further react with NO2, NO3, HO2, and other peroxy radicals. Laboratory studies show that the primary NO3 + isoprene reaction products (yields in parentheses) are: organic nitrates (∼80%), HCHO (less than 5% to 11%), methyl vinyl ketone (3.5%), methacrolein (3.5%).55,269,272 The resulting nitrates can be further subdivided into C5-nitroxy-carbonyl, C5-hydroxynitrate and C5-nitroxy-hydroperoxide.263,268,269 Rollins et al.273 and Perring et al.274 found similar nitrate yields of 70 ± 8% and 65 ± 12%, respectively, in a chamber studies under atmospheric conditions. In addition, Rollins et al.273 found a yield of 40 ± 20% of secondary dinitrates from the reaction of the primary isoprene nitrates with NO3. This is equivalent to a NO3 + primary isoprene nitrates rate constant of 7 × 10−14 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.
NO3 + terpene reactions have also received attention as terpenes, in contrast to isoprene, are also emitted at night by the biosphere, and because secondary organic aerosols are formed with high yields (see below). While the exact reaction mechanisms are only weakly established, they seem to follow the initial reaction steps of other alkenes. It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss the details of these reactions and we will instead focus on a discussion of the end products of these reactions. Several studies have investigated the products of the NO3 + α-pinene reaction.268,275–278 The major gas-phase product is pinonaldehyde (yield 49–75%), norpinonaldehyde, pinene oxide, campholene aldehyde, and alkyl-nitrates (yield ∼15%). Alkyl-nitrates identified in chamber studies were 3-oxopi-nane-2-nitrate, 2-hydroxypinane-3-nitrate, and pinonaldehyde-PAN. The molecular carbonyl yield for the NO3 + β-pinene reaction is 14% and thus considerably lower than that for the α-pinene reaction, with a much higher formation yield of alkyl-nitrates of 61%.278 Similarly, the NO3 reaction with Δ3-carene shows a 29% aldehyde and 66% nitrate yield.278 For the NO3 + limonene reaction endolim was identified as the main aldehyde product (yield ∼29%) and a nitrate yield of 48–67%.277,278
The addition of NO3 to the aromatic ring is unimportant and consequently reactions with monocyclic aromatics proceed primarily by abstraction of a H-atom from the alkyl substituent groups.258 Reaction rates are slow, with the rates of the most abundant aromatics, i.e. benzene, toluene, xylenes, etc., below 10−15 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. Generally the rates increase with the number of substituent groups, but are nevertheless too slow to be of atmospheric significance. Aromatics with a vinyl substituent, such as styrene, have higher rates, similar to those of linear alkenes.
Reactions of NO3 with phenolic compounds, i.e. phenol and cresols, are several orders of magnitude faster than those of toluene and the xylenes, for example 5.8 × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for phenol.279 At these rates NO3 reactions are efficient removal pathways of phenol and cresol, which have lifetimes of only a few minutes.280 The products of these reactions are predominately hydroxy-benzenes, but toxic nitrophenols with yields of 4–8% are also formed.281,282
The reactions of NO3 with a number of different oxygenated VOCs have also been investigated. Similar to non-oxygenated VOCs, reaction rates are faster when a double bond is present or the compound is phenolic (see above). In the atmosphere the reactions of aldehydes proceed by an H-atom abstraction from the aldehyde group, forming an acyl-peroxy radical (RCO3) and HNO3.283 The acyl-peroxy radicals can the further react with NO2 to form peroxyacyl nitrates.284 The rate constants of the NO3 + aldehyde reaction rates increase from 5.6 × 10−16 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for HCHO, to rates between 1–5 × 10−14 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for larger aldehydes. Rates of NO3 + ketone reactions are too small for these reactions to be important in the atmosphere.
Reactions of NO3 with saturated alcohols, which proceed by the H-atom abstraction from the carbon atom hosting the –OH group, are in the range of 1–20 × 10−16 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 and thus also too slow to be of significance. The rates of unsaturated alcohols, some of which, for example methyl-butenol, have been found at elevated levels in forested areas, initially react similarly to the respective alkenes with rate constants in the range of 10−12–10−14 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.285 Reaction products from a number of unsaturated alcohols include small carbonyl compounds such as formaldehyde (yield 1–37%), and nitrooxy-acetaldehyde (32–63%).286 The yield of nitrates formed in these reactions is 38–71%.
The ability to predict NO3 + VOC rate constants is not as far evolved as in the case of OH reactions, although a number of attempts have been published.287–289 A recent study290 presented an improved structure–activity relationship (SAR) parameterization based on 150 NO3 + VOC reactions that is capable of predicting 91% of the rate constants within a factor of 2, with the exception of saturated alcohols for which the predictions are less reliable. This capability now approaches the quality of long established OH + VOC SAR.291
3.2 Impact of NO3 on the sulphur cycle
The relevance of the reaction between NO3 and DMS was first noted by Winer et al.,25 who argued that at a mixing ratio of 10 pptv the lifetime of DMS due to the NO3 reaction is shorter than that due to the OH reaction. A number of field studies have since confirmed the significance of NO3 for DMS oxidation (see Section 2).
The reaction of DMS with NO3 proceeds through the abstraction of an H-atom forming nitric acid and the CH3SCH2 radical.292 NO3 + CH3SCH3 → CH3SCH2 + HNO3(R3.1)The currently recommended rate constant for this reaction is 1.1 × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 (298 K),54 which is sufficiently fast to make this reaction important for the marine sulphur cycle. CH3SCH2 reacts rapidly with O2 to form the CH3SCH2O2 peroxy-radical, which has thus far not been directly observed in the atmosphere. At night this peroxy-radical can then further react with NO3 to form CH3S and formaldehyde. Other possible reactions include the self-reaction of the CH3SCH2O2 peroxy-radical forming two CH3S radicals. The reaction with HO2 or other peroxy radicals leads to hydroperoxides or other organoperoxides which are likely deposited to the ocean surface, leading to a loss of gaseous sulphur from the marine boundary layer.293 The fate of the CH3S radical is still under investigation,294 but it is assumed that it is transformed into SO2, possibly methane sulfonic acid, and ultimately H2SO4/SO42−.
Because DMS is the dominant natural source of sulphur in the atmosphere, the oxidation of DMS impacts the sulphur budget and thus aerosol levels and cloud formation. The NO3 + DMS reaction can also serve as a significant sink of NOx182 and in many cases dominate the NO3 budget (see Section 2). In addition, the formation of radical species in the oxidation chain can impact the oxidative budget of the marine boundary layer.75
There is ample observational evidence for the significance of the NO3 + DMS reaction, as described in Section 2.5. Modeling studies generally confirm the observational studies. Lucas and Prinn295 found 45–60% of DMS oxidation occurred by NO3 in their model calculations of the Central Tropical Pacific and Southern Ocean regions. With the contribution to SO2 formation being in the range of 46–71% depending on the oxidation mechanism used. They also found that the formation of MSA depended on the mechanism, varying between 0–28%. Karl et al.296 analysed two low NOx (<20 pptv) cases, i.e. the Central Arctic Ocean and the Southern Indian Ocean, and one moderately polluted in the Mediterranean sea with 500 pptv NOx. NO3 oxidation in the low NOx cases was unimportant due to the low NO3 mixing ratios. However, in the moderately polluted scenario the contribution of DMS oxidation by NO3 was dominant compared to the OH oxidation route.
The significance of NO3 oxidation for the global budget of DMS and sulphur is not well established. Early modelling studies suggest only a contribution of 11% and 16% of NO3 chemistry to the global DMS budget,297,298 with a distinct difference in the northern and southern hemisphere, i.e. 24% vs. 10%.298 More recent studies find higher global contributions. For example, Boucher et al.299 found the contribution of NO3 oxidation to the global DMS budget to vary between 23–56%, depending on the simulated NO3 levels, which on the other hand depended on the VOC chemistry and the heterogeneous uptake of N2O5. Breider et al.,29 found in a global model study that 24% of global DMS oxidation proceeded though the NO3 channel.
As pointed out by Platt et al.75 the reaction of NO3 with DMS should also have an impact on the concentrations of RO2 radicals. Cantrell et al.62 argue that the NO3 + DMS reaction can explain their observations of 1–12 pptv nocturnal RO2. Similarly, Carslaw et al.67 argue through a modelling analysis of observation on the British east coast that, at the observed DMS and NO3 levels, the CH3SCH2O2 radical should dominate the RO2 budget in the MBL. However, they found no clear evidence for the expected RO2 levels resulting from this reaction and argue that their chemical amplifier instrument is insensitive to the CH3SCH2O2 radical.
3.3 Influence of NO3 chemistry on HOx and RO2
As described in the introduction and in the discussion of the NO3 + VOC reactions, reaction of NO3 and ozone with alkenes can lead to the production of various types of radicals. The link of NO3 and RO2, HO2, and OH radicals was first proposed by Platt et al.75 In addition to the initial formation of RO2, NO3 can also take over the role as radical propagator for very low NO conditions: NO3 + RO2 → NO2 + RO + O2(R3.2)The rates of these reactions are in the range of 1−2 × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.300–305
The reaction of NO3 with HO2 has also been proposed as a source of nocturnal OH, NO3 + HO2 → NO2 + OH + O2(R3.3a)   → O2 + HNO3(R3.3b)with a recommended rate constant of 4 × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.54 The branching ratio of ka/(ka + kb) at 298 K is in the range of <0.6306 to 1.307 The reaction of NO3 with formaldehyde can also lead to the formation of OH radicals, but with a rate of 5.5 × 10−16 cm3 molecule−1 s−154 is fairly slow and likely not important.
The presence of RO2 radicals at night at levels of up to 40 pptv have been confirmed in multiple studies.7,60–63,65,67,308,309 However, the link of nighttime RO2 with NO3 is often difficult to demonstrate, as the simultaneous occurring VOC oxidation by ozone also forms radicals. Several studies have shown the expected correlation between NO3 and RO263,67 (see Fig. 12), while other studies found an anti-correlation7 or no relation.66
 Fig. 12  Average RO2, NO3 mixing ratios and photolysis frequencies measured in a rural area in Germany.52 The presence of RO2 and its correlation with NO3 is clearly visible from this data set. Reprinted with permission from the Journal of Geophysical Research. 
Geyer et al.52 explains the positive correlation between NO3 and RO2 by their co-dependence on NO, i.e. the reaction of NO3 and RO2 with NO will reduce the concentration of both radicals simultaneously and the two thus appear to be positively correlated. This behaviour is expected to be prevalent in semi-polluted areas. Under circumstances where VOC concentrations are sufficiently low to not influence NO3 levels, a positive correlation between NO3 and RO2 is caused by the dependence of the RO2 production rate on NO3. In clean rural forested areas, where VOCs are the dominant sink of NO3, NO levels are low, and the NO3 production rate is independent of the VOC levels, a negative correlation between NO3 and RO2 is modelled.52
One of the first simultaneous nocturnal NO3 and RO2 observations at a rural site in Germany found nocturnal RO2 of up to 40 pptv that could be reproduced by a model assuming that VOC chemistry was dominated by monoterpenes.60 The same study also reported HO2 mixing ratios of up to 10 pptv and up to 1 × 105 cm−3 OH.
Observations in the MBL on the British east coast found up to 6 pptv of RO2, that were associated with VOC processing by NO3.67 Long-term measurements at the same location suggest that NO3 chemistry is a more important source of RO2 radicals in winter than in summer.308 Another study in the clean Irish west coast MBL, on the other hand, concluded that ozonolysis of alkenes was likely responsible for the majority of the formation of RO2 radicals (mean 66%).66 However, during times of maximum NO3 (midnight) the contribution of NO3 + VOC to RO2 formation was comparable. These observations are likely representative for the processes in the clean marine boundary layer, where VOC levels are low. Similar results were also found under more polluted conditions, but as the authors point out, larger VOCs were not considered and the results are thus more tentative. It should also be noted that these marine studies neglected the contribution of the NO3 + DMS reaction to RO2 formation, due to the inability of their instruments to see the CH3SCH2O2 radical.
In a rural semi-polluted area in Germany, Geyer et al.52 found that NO3 was responsible for 77% of observed RO2, 53% of the observed HO2 and 36% of observed OH radicals, while alkene ozonolysis was responsible for 12% of RO2, 47% of HO2 and 64% of OH radicals at night. In contrast, urban experiments in the UK showed that the ozonolysis of alkenes dominated over the NO3 + VOC reactions as a source of RO2, with about a third of the RO2 formation due to NO3 + alkene reactions.79,310
From the field observations it appears that in clean marine areas NO3 reactions play a less significant role than O3 + VOC in the formation of RO2, if DMS oxidation is not considered. However, as pointed out by Carslaw et al.,67 the formation of the CH3SCH2O2 radical can outweigh other RO2 sources.62,67 In continental areas under the influence of biogenic VOC emissions NO3 + VOC can be the dominant RO2 source.7,52 In urban areas the ozonolysis of alkenes again appears to be dominant over NO3 reactions.
Some modelling studies confirm that in moderately polluted areas NO3 and O3 reactions contribute equally to RO2 formation, while ozonolysis dominates in urban and low NOx environments.265 The formation of OH is mostly due to the ozonolysis of alkenes, with a 25% contribution from NO3 + VOC reactions.265 Geyer and Stutz,311 concluded that NO3 + VOC reactions are the major source of RO2 radicals at night in their highly resolved one-dimensional chemistry and transport model. Their argument is based on the high NO3 levels aloft that result from the suppressed mixing in the nocturnal boundary layer. They also note that, away from surface NO sources, the fate of RO2 radicals is predominantly their self reaction rather than the reaction with NO3. In their model the main source of HO2 was the reaction of RO2 with NO, OH + CO, and the ozonolysis of VOCs. Formation of OH was mostly due to HO2 + NO and ozonolysis of VOCs. NO3 chemistry did not play a role in either the formation of HO2 or OH.
Geyer and Stutz311 also describe how nocturnal boundary layer radical chemistry depends on vertical stability as well as NO and VOC emissions. They propose a three layer view of nocturnal radical chemistry. In a surface layer with high NO concentrations, radical chemistry is efficiently suppressed as the titration of NO3 and ozone by NO lowers the concentrations of these radical precursors. They noted that this layer is not always present in the NBL, as it also depends on the emission rates of NO. In the upper part of the boundary layer, where NO levels are negligible, RO2 is produced by NO3/O3 + VOC reactions, however the radical propagation is slow and often dominated by RO2 + RO2 reactions. OH is solely formed by ozonolysis of alkenes in this layer. Between these two layers a reactive mixing layer exists in which O3, NO3, RO2, and NO co-exist. NO levels are maintained by vertical mixing from below (or direct emissions). RO2 can be transported into this layer from aloft and is also produced locally. It is in this layer that the most active radical chemistry can occur, as the NO3/O3 + VOC radical initiation reactions can be followed by radical propagation by NO, effectively forming HO2 and OH. The highest nocturnal OH and HO2 levels were predicted in this layer, which always formed at night if surface NO emissions are present. The altitude range of this layer varies with the NO source strength and vertical stability at night. Observations of nocturnal radicals thus have to be interpreted with respect to the meteorological conditions at night and are likely not representative of the entire boundary layer. In the light of these results it is also clear that we know little about the radical chemistry in the residual layer and the free troposphere.
Finally, the night-time chemistry of N2O5 to produce ClNO2 can significantly influence peroxy radicals on the following day. Section 4.5 describes this effect in more detail.
3.4 Other gas-phase NO3 reactions
NO3 radicals are also known to react with gaseous halogen species. The most important reactions of these are the reaction of NO3 + I2, which leads to the formation of I-atoms at night with a rate constant of 1.5 × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1.312 The I-atom can then further react with ozone to form IO. The role of the NO3 + I2 reaction has been confirmed by observations of up to 2.5 pptv of IO at night at Mace Head, Ireland.190 NO3 is also known to react with halogen atoms to form halogen oxides at fast rates.312–314
The reaction of NO3 with di-methyl mercury has also been observed in the laboratory, with rate constants that imply that this reaction may be significant in the atmosphere.315,316 The likely main product of this reaction is HgO. However, little more is known about the significance of this reaction in the atmosphere.
3.5 NO3 aerosol uptake
Relatively little information is available to assess the effect of NO3 aerosol uptake on the basis of field measurements, in part due to the challenge of separating the effects of NO3 gas-phase reactions from N2O5 and NO3 aerosol reactions. Analyses of field data that have included NO3 heterogeneous uptake have typically used rather small uptake coefficients. Wong and Stutz21 list the contribution of NO3 uptake for the nocturnal NOx budget at 0.4% for an NO3 uptake coefficient of 1.3 × 10−3, while Aldener et al.198 list this contribution at 2% of the overall NO3 loss budget in a marine environment using an uptake coefficient of 4 × 10−3. Moise et al.317 investigated the uptake of NO3 on particles and also found their contribution to the loss of NO3 on inorganic and aqueous particles insignificant, while the loss on organic particles was higher, reaching 10–17% in rural unforested and marine areas, where other NO3 loss processes are small. It thus appears that the uptake of NO3 is only significant for the budget of NO3 and NOx when other loss processes of NO3 and N2O5 are small. Such environments could include marine areas, dry desert areas and the free troposphere. The exception is cloudy or foggy conditions, which offer a large enough surface area to make heterogeneous NO3 (and N2O5) uptake efficient.318 Model studies have also shown multiphase chemistry of NO3 can be important to sulphur budgets through aqueous phase oxidation reactions, especially in wintertime, northern latitudes.318,319
The interest in the NO3 + aerosol interaction is thus mainly based on a better understanding of NO3 chemistry on the composition and physical properties of aerosol particles. “Aging” of organic aerosol due to interaction with radicals, such as NO3, can change their hygroscopic properties and thus their ability to serve as cloud condensation nuclei. This, on the other hand, has a direct effect on the earth radiation budget.320 For example, the hygroscopicity of oleic acid, which by itself does not take up water, changes when exposed to NO3 and takes up water at 97 ± 1% R.H.321 The volatilization of saturated hydrocarbon surfaces, on the other hand, has been found to be unimportant.322 Reactions of NO3 on particle surfaces can also change the relative particle composition, preferentially removing compounds such as levoglucosan that serve as tracers for biomass burning.323
Our knowledge of the reaction of NO3 with aerosol particles is predominantly based on laboratory observations. The interaction of NO3 with a surface is typically given as a reactive uptake coefficient (see Table 2 for an overview of these uptake coefficients for NO3), which quantifies the reaction probability of a molecule upon impact on a surface (see below). The uptake of NO3 on pure water is fairly small, but increases with the salt concentration in ionic solutions.199 For stratospheric particles, i.e. water ice and sulfuric acid solution particles at low temperature, the NO3 uptake is below 10−3 and is thus not significant.324 The ice uptake increases significantly if the ice surfaces are exposed to HBr and HI reaching uptake coefficients in the range of 0.3–0.5.325 The uptake coefficient of NO3 on dry halogen salts has been measured to ∼0.046–0.049 for NaCl and 0.016–0.02 for KBr.325,326 The NO3 uptake on Saharan dust has found to be quite efficient, with reported reactive uptake coefficients in the range of 9 × 10−3327 up to 0.12.328 The higher value is most likely an upper limit as it was determined based on geometric, rather than the true surface area of dust. Tang et al.327 state that at an uptake coefficient of 9 × 10−3 and a 20 μg cm−3 of dust loading, the NO3 lifetime is ∼9 h. NO3 aerosol uptake in the boundary layer is thus likely not of significance. However the NO3 lifetime due to other chemistry in the free troposphere can be sufficiently long that dust clouds can have an impact on NO3. Compared to the N2O5 uptake, which is of similar magnitude, the NO3 uptake is most likely not a significant NOx sink or aerosol nitrate source.

The interaction of NO3 with organic particles has been found to be quite efficient.317,329,330 Reactive uptake coefficients of γ(NO3) = 1.4 × 10−3−1.5 × 10−2 on liquid organic,317 and γ(NO3) = 0.001–0.62 on organics with functional groups deemed to representative for organic aerosol commonly found in the atmosphere have been reported.330 Moise et al.317 concluded that, based on a reduction of the uptake coefficients by a factor of 5 upon freezing of n-hexadecane and n-octanoic and through diffuse-reactive length calculations, that the reaction is not a pure surface reaction but appears to occur deeper in the particle.317,320 The reactivity increases from the least reactive n-alkanes and octanoic acid to compounds with more reactive functional groups and with double bonds following the reactivity order known from gas-phase reactions.317,331 The highest reactive uptake coefficients are found for lineoleic acid with γ(NO3) = 1.5 × 10−2.317 The uptake coefficients on organic monolayers appear to be higher, possibly due to the location of the double bond on the surface.331
The question of the reactive uptake of NO3 on mixtures of organics has only recently been addressed. Xiao and Bertram332 report that the uptake coefficient on a mixture of methyl oleate with other species depends on the matrix and mixing ratios. They also report that for solid–liquid mixtures a decrease of γ was observed that is consistent with the decrease of the number of carbon double bonds in the liquid phase due to the reaction with NO3. Xiao and Bertram332 also calculated the characteristic time of 100 nm radius particles of methyl oleate in matrices of diethyl sebacate, dioctyl sebacate, and squalane against oxidation by 25 pptv of NO3 to 13, 26, and 35 minutes assuming bulk reactions, respectively, and 8, 18, and 28 minutes assuming surface reactions, respectively. As unsaturated compounds similar to methyl oleate, such as oleic acid, have been observed in the atmosphere, NO3 oxidation of organic particles likely plays a significant role in the atmosphere. Zhao et al.333 reported uptake coefficient of NO3 to unsaturated fatty acid particles, finding very large γ values of 0.27, 0.53, 0.72 and 1.01 for oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid, respectively. Product yield shifted in the presence of 20% O2 in the bath gas, suggesting that the subsequent chemistry of nitrated peroxy radicals was different than the nitrated adducts alone. Observed product distributions were consistent with those of other groups.321,329
The NO3 + VOC(s) reactions appear to proceed in a similar manner as the gas-phase oxidation, with an addition to the carbon double bond, followed by the formation of a nitrooxyalkyl peroxy radical. The latter can react with itself to form hydroxy nitrates and carbonyl nitrates, or react with NO2 to form nitrooxy peroxynitrates, which decay into carbonyl nitrates and dinitrates.321,329,334 The observed aerosol end products are thus similar to those in the gas-phase.
Knopf et al.335 have measured NO3 uptake coefficients for biomass burning surrogates such as levoglucosan, abeitic acid and nitroguaiacol. They determined uptake coefficients in the range 1–26 × 10−3, with corresponding lifetimes for oxidation of the particle surface of 9–112 minutes for an NO3 concentration of 50 pptv. Although uptake coefficients for other oxidants, such as ozone, were smaller, ozone was a more efficient particle surface oxidant than NO3 due to its larger atmospheric abundance (100 ppbv O3 assumed in this study). Shiraiwa et al.323 applied a more sophisticated model to estimate particle lifetimes with respect to NO3 oxidation, considering surface and bulk reactions, as well as phase changes between amorphous solids and aqueous particles.
NO3 reactive uptake coefficients for PAH have been found to be large (0.059 (+0.11/−0.049) for benz[a]anthracene to 0.79 (+0.21/−0.67) for pyrene).330 NO3 oxidation can thus be an important, and under certain conditions even dominant, loss pathway for PAH.330 The few available studies point to a possibly significant impact of NO3 on the composition of organic aerosol. More laboratory and field studies are needed to further investigate the significance of this chemistry. The reaction of NO3 with soot has been studied in a number of laboratory experiments. The reported uptake coefficients vary widely, depending on the source of the soot, from γ(NO3) < 4 × 10−4 (graphitic spark generator),336 0.0025 (hexane soot)−0.0054 (methane soot),337 to 0.05−0.2 (decane soot).328 In most experiments the initial uptake coefficient was higher, but reached the steady state value quoted above later in the experiments. Karagulian and Rossi,338 found in their laboratory experiments that ∼65% of NO3 is irreversibly adsorbed and the rest forms N2O5. There is also tentative evidence for the formation of nitro-PAH's upon the reaction of NO3–N2O5 mixtures on soot.339
Kaiser et al.340 modelled the oxidation of monolayers of PAHs on soot particles using the PRA framework.341 They found PAH's to have lifetimes (expressed here as half lives) on the order of seconds for NO3 oxidation during the night. They further found a strong dependence of the NO3 uptake coefficients on the presence of highly reactive surface PAH's. Due to the relatively low atmospheric abundance of the PAHs, however, there was little feedback to gas phase atmospheric concentrations.
3.6 Secondary organic aerosol formation
Production of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from atmospheric oxidation of VOCs is a function of the molecular weight and reactivity of the VOC, the composition of seed aerosol on which the growth takes place and the availability of NOx, among other variables. The identity of the oxidant also plays an important role, with differing efficiencies for SOA production from VOC reactions with OH, O3 and NO3. As discussed in preceding sections, NO3 oxidation is rapid mainly for unsaturated compounds, including biogenic VOCs (isoprene, monoterpenes), so studies of NO3 driven SOA oxidation have focused mainly on biogenic hydrocarbons. Furthermore, because NO3 is derived exclusively from NOx in the atmosphere, SOA production from NO3 + BVOC is one of the mechanisms by which anthropogenic pollutants influence biogenic SOA production.34
The first laboratory studies of SOA production from NO3 oxidation of BVOC demonstrated that this oxidant had higher SOA yields than OH or O3. Yields of SOA are commonly defined on a mass basis as the ratio of SOA mass produced to that of hydrocarbon mass consumed. Hoffman et al.342,343 investigated oxidation of a series of monoterpenes in a smog chamber under photo-oxidation conditions in which the mixture of NOx and O3 was such that NO3 radical production and predicted mixing ratios were substantial even though the chamber was illuminated. Modelling of SOA production from β-pinene during different times during the experiment when different oxidants were dominant showed that 22% of the parent hydrocarbon consumption could be attributed to NO3 reaction, but 88% of the aerosol yield was due to this oxidant, establishing an important role for NO3 as a trigger for SOA formation. Shortly thereafter, Griffin et al.253 measured SOA from dark oxidation of several monoterpenes in the presence of NO3 alone in the same chamber and found very large yields, in the range 13–73% for Δ-carene, 32–89% for β-pinene, and 14–72% for sabinene for reaction of 19–96 ppbv of parent hydrocarbon (Table 3). These yields were much larger than that of dark ozonolysis, which produced maximum yields of 13, 5 and 4% for the same three monoterpenes, respectively. Only α-pinene had lower SOA yields for NO3 reaction than for ozonolysis, with maximum ozonolysis yields of 19% and an “insignificant” yield for NO3 reaction. Because mass yields represent an equilibrium between gas and aerosol phase and are thus concentration dependent, these authors fit their results to a 2-product Odum model344 with condensable product yields (α) and equilibrium constants for gas-particle partitioning of organic matter (Kom) as parameters. These fits determined a unit yield (α = 1.00) of condensable products from NO3 oxidation of β-pinene and sabinene and 74% from Δ-carene. These yields were much larger than either OH or O3 oxidation of the same hydrocarbons, although the inferred volatility of the NO3 products was somewhat larger than for the other oxidants. The large yields from these original experiments on NO3 formed the basis for several regional and global model studies, as described below.

Hallquist et al.345 and Moldanova and Ljungstrom346 also reported yields for NO3 oxidation of monoterpenes from work at a large environmental chamber (EUPHORE, Valencia, Spain). Hallquist et al.345 found somewhat lower yields than Griffin et al.,253 with 0.2–16%, 10–52%, 15–62% and 17% (single experiment at 18 ppbv) for oxidation of 18–580 ppbv of α-pinene, β-pinene, Δ-carene and limonene, respectively. These authors did not analyse results in terms of an Odum-type relationship. Bonn and Moortgat347 examined particle formation from α and β-pinene by OH, O3 and NO3 in a small glass reactor vessel, finding O3 to be a more effective nucleator than the other oxidants. They also found higher growth yields for O3 with α-pinene than other oxidants, but found approximately equal efficiencies for O3, OH and NO3 with β-pinene, in stark contrast to the results of Griffin et al.253 Spittler et al.277 reported limiting yields at high organic mass for NO3 oxidation of α-pinene and limonene, finding a 16% yield for α-pinene on an organic seed, but lower values for inorganic seeds and with moderate (20%) relative humidity. They also found 40% yield for NO3 + limonene on an organic seed, twice that of Hallquist et al.,345 but lower yields on inorganic seed. Fry et al.348,349 reported SOA yields from NO3 reactions of β-pinene and limonene in three experimental runs in another large environmental chamber (SAPHIR, Jülich, Germany). For more modest initial VOC inputs (16 ppbv), they found an SOA yield of 50% for β-pinene, independent of relative humidity, and 40% for limonene. This result is slightly higher than the original yield reported by Griffin et al. (32% for β-pinene) for similar hydrocarbon input. Results from both the Fry et al.348,349 and Hallquist et al.345 studies found that oxidation reactions that produced high yields of organic nitrates also produced high SOA yields, implicating these nitrates as key condensable species responsible for SOA from NO3 reactions. Finally, Perraud et al.276 recently reported the identification of several nitrate species in the NO3 oxidation of α-pinene.
Organic aerosol production from isoprene oxidation by NO3 has only recently been investigated, although the results are similar to that for the monoterpenes in that SOA yields are higher than for other oxidants. Ng et al.263 reported yields of 4–24% for isoprene consumption of 18–102 ppbv; a fit to a 2-product Odum function gave a summed yield (α1 + α2) of 29% of condensable products, and a 10% yield for an organic aerosol mass of 10 μg m−3. They provided an extensive mechanistic analysis and showed evidence for SOA production from second-generation oxidation productions. They predicted global SOA production of 2–3 Tg year−1 based on an estimated 7% of global isoprene oxidized by NO3. Rollins et al.273 examined isoprene oxidation in a large chamber (SAPHIR) at lower total concentration, finding negligible production from first generation NO3 + isoprene products, but a 14% yield from second generation oxidation. Methylbuteneol (MBO) is another 5-carbon biogenic VOC whose emissions dominate in some environments, for example the western United States. Noda and Ljungstrom350 measured aerosol formation from its NO3 oxidation, focusing mainly on nucleation, but also reporting growth yields in the range 0–28%.
Anthropogenic VOCs (alkanes, aromatics, small alkenes) generally react slower with NO3, and the corresponding SOA yields have not been investigated in detail. Gong et al.261 showed that for linear alkenes smaller than 7-carbons, there is essentially no SOA production despite relatively fast reaction rate constants. Since emissions of large linear alkenes are likely very small, organic aerosol production is expected to be minimal in the atmosphere. Malloy et al.351 demonstrated that amines, one class of potentially large agricultural emissions, react with NO3 to produce organic aerosol with yields up to 44%.
Laboratory studies showing large SOA yields from NO3 oxidation of BVOC spurred a series of model studies to quantify the global and regional effects of this chemistry. Following their initial laboratory studies, Griffin et al.352 produced a global model in which they neglected the effect of NO3 oxidation in calculating biogenic SOA on the premise that too little BVOC underwent oxidation by NO3. Chung and Seinfeld353 later revisited this question, showing that in their model NO3 + BVOC was responsible for 9% of global SOA even though they calculated only 2% of BVOC to be oxidized by this mechanism. Their model also produced substantially less total SOA than later estimates, however. Hoyle et al.36 arrived at a much different result, calculating that as much as 27% of global biogenic SOA was due to NO3 oxidation, with 50–60% in regionally polluted areas. These high estimates were based on treating all monoterpenes with the parameterization for β-pinene from Griffin et al.253 A parameterization with lower yields of condensable products, 16% from α-pinene and 40% from limonene to represent the range of laboratory data, still produced 21% of global SOA from NO3 reactions in their model. Some models have also indicated large effects on regional scales. Russell and Allen354 calculated the reaction of NO3 with β-pinene to be the third largest source of SOA by mass (kg total production) in Houston, TX, and the largest source by volume (μg m−3), since the volume weighted production at night occurs in a shallower boundary layer than photochemical sources. These authors did not include NO3 reactions with α-pinene, the largest VOC emission in that area. Fry et al.348 used their results for NO3 + β-pinene to calculate that 16% of the total organic aerosol emission for California could be accounted for by this single oxidant–VOC pair. Pye et al.35 found large regional influence for NO3 + monoterpenes and NO3 + isoprene. These authors also used the data from Griffin et al.,253 but re-parameterized it using a volatility basis set (VBS) approach.355 Their results showed that in the southeast U.S., NO3 reactions more than doubled the amount of monoterpene aerosol, and increased isoprene SOA by 30–40%. However, these authors also made the simplifying assumption that all monoterpenes had the same SOA yield as β-pinene for the NO3 reaction. Finally, Fry et al.356 have recently calculated NO3 driven SOA across the Western U.S., finding peak production rates of 0.4–3 μg kg h−1, strongly concentrated downwind of urban areas.
Observational data from field studies to verify these model predictions remains sparse. McLaren et al.222 analysed particulate pinonaldehyde in aerosol samples collected in the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada, finding significant increases in nighttime samples. They interpreted the result as NO3 oxidation of α-pinene, which produces pinonaldehyde in large yield. Iinuma et al.215 found nitro-oxy organosulfate compounds in nighttime aerosol samples from Bavaria, Germany, suggesting this compound, which comes from NO3-monoterpene reactions, to be an important fraction of organic mass. Rastogi et al.357 measured particulate water soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) at sites in the southeast U.S., finding larger amounts in nighttime samples, consistent with production through NO3 chemistry.
4. Atmospheric chemistry of N2O5
The heterogeneous uptake of N2O5 to aerosol is one of the single most important reactions regulating oxidant and aerosol formation in the troposphere. Reaction of N2O5 with liquid water (i.e., hydrolysis) produces two nitric acid molecules (or particulate nitrate, depending on the thermodynamically favoured phase of NO3−358) N2O5 (g) + H2O (l) → 2HNO3 (g)(R4.1)Because N2O5 is the acid anhydride of HNO3, the reaction is strongly favoured thermodynamically, with a reaction enthalpy of some −40.1 kJ mol−1.142 As discussed in Section 4.4, the reaction is slow in the gas phase, although even a very small rate coefficient can have significant influence in the atmosphere. It does occur readily via heterogeneous uptake to aerosol particles, however. Thus, the heterogeneous first order loss rate coefficient of N2O5 in an air mass depends on the aerosol surface area density, SA (μm2 cm−3), and the uptake (or sticking) coefficient, γ(N2O5). kN2O5 = ¼cSAγ(N2O5)(4.1)Here, c is the mean molecular speed of N2O5 (m s−1). Eqn (4.1) does not include corrections for the limitation of gas phase diffusion to the particle surface, and is approximately correct for small uptake coefficients and small particle size.359
4.1 N2O5 hydrolysis in atmospheric models
Comparisons of early field measurements of NOx and HNO3 within urban areas to box model calculations that included heterogeneous processes360 placed constraints on the likely range of the uptake coefficient. The γ(N2O5) most consistent with initial field measurements was in the range 10−3–10−2, similar to but slightly larger than the range from more recent studies. Model studies in the early 1980s identified the role of N2O5 hydrolysis in the non-photochemical conversion of NOx to soluble nitrate, which was found to be comparable to daytime oxidation of NO2via OH radical reaction.181,361 These models also explained the seasonal dependence of acid deposition in regionally polluted areas,362 and the production of nitric acid during transport of polluted air across the Los Angeles basin.363 The important role of clouds, which offer a very large available surface area for heterogeneous process on droplets, was also identified in model studies as being important to nitrogen oxide budgets due to N2O5 uptake, even during daytime.364,365 Dimitroulopoulou and Marsh366 also simulated the nighttime concentration profiles of NO3 and N2O5 in a box model to show the strong increase in N2O5 loss rate upon inclusion of the heterogeneous uptake relative to the homogeneous reaction with water vapour alone.
The landmark global model study of Dentener and Crutzen19 clearly identified the tropospheric importance of N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis. Their study showed a 50% reduction in global tropospheric nitrogen oxides due to this reaction, with large seasonal and hemispheric effects (e.g., 80% NOx reduction in the winter hemisphere, 20% in summer). There were corresponding reductions in global O3 and OH burdens of 9% each, again with larger seasonal effects (e.g., a 25% reduction in northern hemisphere midlatitude spring O3). The study suggested a coupling between SO2 emissions and oxidants, since the source of the aerosol for N2O5 uptake in their model was sulphate from these emissions. The model predicted that a large reduction in SO2 emissions might lead to as much as a 15% increase in surface O3. Importantly, this study assumed a reactive uptake coefficient, γ(N2O5), at a fixed value of 0.1. More recent studies have found the uptake coefficient to be somewhat smaller and more variable,169,367 and have shown that ClNO2 is also produced from N2O5 reactive uptake in high yield (see sections below).32,33
Global model studies that followed Dentener and Crutzen made varying assumptions about uptake coefficients and aerosols, but arrived at similar conclusions regarding its large influence on NOx and oxidants. Jacob368 recommended a γ(N2O5) value of 0.1 (range 0.01–1) for tropospheric models, a value that was broadly consistent with field data available at that time. Several global tropospheric models that followed incorporated this recommendation, finding results generally similar to Dentener and Crutzen about sensitivity of tropospheric NOx, O3 and OH to chemistry-aerosol coupling through uptake of N2O5 (Fig. 13).369–374 In 2005, Evans and Jacob incorporated updated laboratory data for the efficiency of N2O5 uptake into a global model. Their parameterization explicitly resolved the dependence of γ(N2O5) on aerosol composition and relative humidity, and produced a mean γ(N2O5) of 0.02 in place of the fixed value of 0.1 used previously. The revision modestly increased simulated global NOx, O3 and OH burdens (7, 4 and 8%, respectively), but still led to the same broad conclusions that N2O5 hydrolysis strongly regulates these species. Wu et al.375 showed that implementation of the newer recommendations led to one of the largest shifts in model-predicted tropospheric chemical ozone production relative to other changes in the GEOS-Chem chemical mechanism. Later global studies of the influence of heterogeneous reactions have generally incorporated these recommendations.376,378 Alexander et al.377 determined a reduced importance for N2O5 hydrolysis of 18% for global atmospheric NOx removal using this recommendation, lower than the original work of Evans and Jacob.379 Macintyre and Evans380 considered the impact of even further reductions in γ(N2O5). They showed that at both high and low values, global NOx become insensitive to variations in γ(N2O5), but that at intermediate values actually characteristic of the troposphere, there was a strong sensitivity. In the northern extra-tropics, the greatest sensitivity occurred for variation in γ(N2O5) over the range 0.001–0.02, approximately what has been determined from more recent laboratory and field studies, as described further below. Thus, an accurate prediction of the influence of N2O5 uptake on NOx and oxidants remains a complicated problem.

Dust aerosol is also a regionally important substrate for heterogeneous chemistry, and model studies have shown its influence on NOx, O3 and OH in areas such as Africa and Asia.381–383 Uptake of N2O5 has also been incorporated into global models of nitrate aerosol, including estimates for its influence on trends in aerosol radiative forcing.384,385
Models have also demonstrated the influence of N2O5 hydrolysis on regional production of nitrate aerosol and nitrate deposition. Munger et al.386 showed that inclusion of N2O5 hydrolysis could account for the seasonal variation of nitrogen deposition at Harvard Forest in the Northeast U.S., particularly during the winter. Makar et al.387 showed that N2O5 hydrolysis resulted in nighttime growth of particulate nitrate at a rural Ontario site during the summer of 1992. They used γ(N2O5) = 0.04 to model this growth. Riemer et al.388 performed the first regional model simulation of the influence of N2O5 hydrolysis on both O3 and nitrate aerosol. They parameterized the uptake as a function of aerosol nitrate content (see below for a description of the nitrate effect). Their box model simulation showed a large sensitivity of O3 to nighttime NOx consumption by N2O5, although their 3-dimensional simulation of a polluted region in southern Germany showed a much smaller sensitivity. Their model did show a large regional effect on aerosol nitrate formation, however. A later study by Riemer et al.389 showed that aerosol coatings due to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) could suppress γ(N2O5) and reduce the potential for nitrate aerosol formation by 90% for simulations over Europe. Additional regional model studies of nitrate aerosol and nitrogen deposition in Europe,390 the United States391–393 and Asia21,394,395 have highlighted the influence of N2O5 hydrolysis, as well as the uncertainty in the parameterization of this chemical pathway. Resolution of this uncertainty is particularly important for understanding nitrate aerosol and nitrate deposition in winter. For example, Davis et al.396 put together a parameterization of γ(N2O5) for use in regional modelling that included its dependence on relative humidity, temperature and inorganic (but not organic) aerosol composition, and showed the largest influence of the reaction to occur in the winter season.
Model based estimates of the impact of N2O5 hydrolysis on regional, summertime ozone have been somewhat more limited. As noted above, the Riemer et al.388 study showed a strong influence of overnight N2O5 hydrolysis on next-day ozone in a box model, but a smaller sensitivity in a 3-dimensional simulation, in part due to the vertical distribution of species in the stratified nighttime boundary layer in their model.388 Cohan et al.397 found a minimal sensitivity of next day ozone to variations in the rate of N2O5 loss due to hydrolysis in a simulation of a smog episode in Houston, TX. By contrast, Wong and Stutz21 found a −4 to +16% sensitivity of next-day ozone to nighttime chemical reactions in a 1-D model simulation of an urban air mass.
Model parameterizations of the N2O5 uptake coefficients that have replaced the simple assumption of a single, constant value depend on a variety of factors. For example, the Evans and Jacob379 parameterization has an extensive description of aerosol composition, including dust, nitrate, sulphate, black carbon and organics and their dependence on relative humidity. The Davis et al.396 parameterization includes a comprehensive literature review of laboratory data for the relative humidity dependence of N2O5 uptake to inorganic salts, but does not include organics. The Riemer et al.388 parameterization considers nitrate only, with no consideration of relative humidity, in order to identify the effect of a single aerosol component. Bertram and Thornton24 have developed a parameterization to describe the competition between nitrate and chloride salts as a function of relative humidity, but without the influence of organics. Anttila et al.,398 on the other hand, have developed a resistor model to describe the effect of organics by regarding them as coatings on inorganic aerosol cores, but without the influence of relative humidity. Section 4.2 below describes the laboratory data that provide the basis for these N2O5 uptake coefficient parameterizations.
4.2 Laboratory measurements of N2O5 uptake coefficients
Golden and Baldwin399 first demonstrated that the heterogeneous uptake of N2O5 to sulphate aerosol could be efficient at tropospheric temperatures. They determined a minimum uptake coefficient, γ(N2O5) ≥ 3.8 × 10−5 on bulk sulphuric acid at room temperature using a Knudsen cell apparatus. However, the reaction probability relevant to the troposphere remained poorly defined until the work of Mozurkewich and Calvert,187 who carried out a systematic study of γ(N2O5) on ammonium bisulphate (NH4HSO4), ammonium sulphate ((NH4)2SO4) and pure sulphuric acid aerosol using an aerosol flow tube apparatus. They also suggested a reaction mechanism in which N2O5 hydrolysis proceeds by uptake to and ionization within the liquid phase. N2O5 (g) ⇆ N2O5 (aq)(R4.2) N2O5 (aq) → NO2+ (aq) + NO3− (aq)(R4.3) NO2+ (aq) + H2O (l) → HNO3 (aq) + H+ (aq)(R4.4) NO3− (aq) + H+ (aq) → HNO3 (aq)(R4.5) 2HNO3 (aq) ⇆ 2HNO3 (g)(R4.6)This general mechanism explains several aspects of N2O5 reactive uptake, as described further below. For ammonium bisulphate, Mozurkewich and Calvert found γ(N2O5) = 0.05 at room temperature for relative humidity (RH) above the efflorescence point (near 40% RH), with γ(N2O5) = 0.09 at 274 K. The uptake coefficients decreased with RH below this point. A limited set of experiments on H2SO4 showed γ(N2O5) near 0.1. It was on the basis of this laboratory data that initial global and regional models employed a constant value of γ(N2O5) = 0.1.
An alternative mechanism for N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis is acid catalysis, in which N2O5 undergoes protonation and dissociates directly to HNO3 and NO2+.400 N2O5 (aq) + H+ (aq) → HNO3 (aq) + NO2+ (aq)(R4.7)This mechanism is applicable to highly acidic, low water content aerosol, such as the stratospheric sulphate layer.
A series of studies on pure sulphuric acid particles (or in some cases bulk liquid) at varying RH found γ(N2O5) in the range 0.05–0.2, increasing with decreasing temperature from room temperature to 220 K.400–407 Many of these studies were aimed at understanding the rate of N2O5 hydrolysis under stratospheric temperatures.408–410 Both Hu and Abbatt405 and Hallquist et al.406 showed that γ(N2O5) decreased to 0.02 at room temperature and high RH for sulphuric acid.
Studies that followed Mozurkewich and Calvert187 for ammonium sulphate and bisulphate aerosol generally found similar values, although with considerable disagreement about the dependence on RH. Hu and Abbatt405 found γ(N2O5) at room temperature on ammonium sulphate in the range 0.02–0.05, but with an inverse dependence on relative humidity (i.e., lowest value at highest RH). By contrast, Kane et al.411 found a steep increase in γ(N2O5) with RH, to maximum values of 0.05 to 0.08 above 90% RH, but less than 0.01 below 40% RH. Concerns were later raised about the RH dependence of the determined aerosol surface area from that study, however, that may have biased results high at high RH.396 Hallquist et al.150 found a different RH dependence on both aerosol types, with a constant value near γ(N2O5) = 0.02 above the efflorescence point, decreasing sharply below this RH. Badger et al.412 found a similar dependence, showing γ(N2O5) = 6 × 10−3 at 25% RH on ammonium sulphate, but 0.015–0.019 over the 50–70% RH. Griffiths et al.413 also found values near 0.02 at 50% RH.
On pure water droplets, Van Doren et al.188 showed γ(N2O5) = 0.04 at 282 K and 0.06 at 271 K, while George et al.414 found smaller values of γ(N2O5) = 0.03 at 262 K, decreasing to 0.013 at 277 K. Schutze and Herrmann415 also found smaller values of <0.01 at 293 K. Kirchner et al.416 provided a limiting value γ(N2O5) ≥ 0.005 at room temperature using a liquid jet. The Van Doren et al.188 result of γ(N2O5) of 0.04 near room temperature has become a canonical number for pure water (see, for example, Heintz et al.186), even though it is a relatively low temperature measurement.
Other components of inorganic aerosol include nitrate and sea salt. Aerosol phase nitrate (NO3−) has the effect of suppressing γ(N2O5) by competing with liquid water for reaction with NO2+ (aq). This suppression is known as the nitrate effect. NO2+ (aq) + NO3− (aq) → N2O5 (aq)(R4.8)The reaction effectively reverses the ionization of N2O5 in solution. Wahner, Mentel and co-workers417,418 showed that γ(N2O5) on NaNO3 aerosol is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than NaSO4, with γ(N2O5) on NaNO3 of (2–3) × 10−3 at RH up to 60% compared to 0.02–0.04 at similar RH on NaSO4. At higher RH, the effect was negligible (γ(N2O5) = 0.02 on NaNO3 near 90% RH). Bertram and Thornton24 undertook a detailed mechanistic study of this effect, demonstrating that the NO2+ (aq) reacts 40 times more rapidly with NO3− (aq) than with liquid water. Similarly, Griffiths et al.419 determined the ratio of these rate coefficients to be 30.
Reaction of N2O5 on halide-containing aerosol is also unusual in that NO2+ (aq) reacts with halide anions, in this case to yield a completely different product. In chloride aerosol, this reaction leads to ClNO2 production.183 NO2+ (aq) + Cl− (aq) → ClNO2 (aq)(R4.9)The impact of this reaction is reviewed in more detail in Section 4.5 below. Uptake coefficients of N2O5 to NaCl or sea salt aerosol have been reported by several groups, and generally fall within or slightly above the range of ammonium sulphate aerosols. Several groups30,420–423 found γ(N2O5) of 0.025–0.03 for deliquesced sea salt. Thornton and Abbatt423 found a much smaller value of 5 × 10−3 for partially crystalline sea salt at 30% RH. Like the reaction of NO2+ (aq) with NO3− (aq), reaction of NO2+ (aq) with Cl− (aq) is more rapid than with liquid water. The initial estimate of the rate coefficients for (R4.9) showed it to be some 830 times faster than that of (R4.4),421 although more recent estimates have indicated it is 450–480 times more rapid.24,424 Bertram and Thornton24 used the NO3− and Cl− effects to construct a parameterization of γ(N2O5) as a function of liquid water content and the concentrations of these two anions, showing that the presence of Cl− could effectively reverse the nitrate effect.
Dust is another major inorganic aerosol type of interest to the atmospheric modelling of N2O5 chemistry, although the term “dust” can refer to a range of chemical compositions. Laboratory measurements of N2O5 uptake to dust have varied widely and depend to some extent on experimental conditions and water content of the dust (or dust surrogate) sample. Seisel et al.425 first reported γ(N2O5) to dry Saharan dust samples in the range 0.013–0.08, indicating efficient uptake even in the absence of relative humidity. Karagulian et al.426 reported γ(N2O5) on a range of dry minerals, including kaolinite, natural limestone, Arizona test dust, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and Saharan dust. They also found large uptake coefficients, in the range 0.02–0.2, with the largest value for Saharan dust. Mogili et al.,427 by contrast, reported very low values (γ(N2O5) < 10−3) for a series of dust mineral types, although their methodology for bulk surface area determinations in a Knudsen cell experiment likely biased their values low. They did show that dry minerals take up N2O5 up to 50 times more efficiently than dry NaCl. Wagner et al.428,429 used both Knudsen cell and aerosol flow tube experiments, again on a series of minerals. For Saharan dust, they showed an inverse dependence on RH, with γ(N2O5) = 0.013 on dry dust, decreasing to 5 × 10−3 at 58% RH. Their later results showed the opposite RH trend for CaCO3, from γ(N2O5) = 0.005–0.02 across the RH range 0–71%. Tang et al.327 measured relative rates for heterogeneous uptake of NO3 and N2O5 to Saharan dust, showing that their uptake efficiencies were essentially equal.
Organics are now recognized as an increasingly important component of atmospheric aerosol.430 Early experiments of N2O5 uptake to carbonaceous aerosol showed a limiting γ(N2O5) > 3 × 10−3.431 More recent laboratory studies of N2O5 uptake to organic and mixed organic/inorganic aerosols has shown the potential for very strong suppression of the uptake. Thornton et al.432 reported γ(N2O5) for malonic acid (a C-3 dicarboxylic acid) similar to that on inorganic salts, with values below 10−3 at low RH, increasing to 0.03 at 50–70% RH. Griffiths et al.419 reproduced this basic result for malonic acid, but showed that larger dicarboxylic acids (succinic, glutaric) had lower limiting values at high RH (70%) of γ(N2O5) = 5–8 × 10−3. At 60% RH, equimolar additions of these larger dicarboxylic acids to ammonium sulphate suppressed the uptake coefficient by a factor of 1.5–1.8. The suppression was somewhat smaller for dicarboxylic acid mixtures with ammonium bisulphate. Gross et al.331 also showed small γ(N2O5) on organic liquids, with values of 2–8 × 10−4 for glycerol (a tri-alcohol), and smaller values on linear unsaturated organic liquids. Badger et al.412 showed that humic acid had very small γ(N2O5) of 2–9 × 10−4 over a relative humidity range of 25–75%, and that even small amounts of humic acid added to ammonium sulphate led to significant suppression of γ(N2O5). At 70% RH, a 6% humic acid fraction led to more than a factor of 2 suppression (γ = 8 × 10−3), while a 40% humic acid fraction led to a factor of 13 suppression (γ = 1.4 × 10−3). Escorcia et al.433 examined γ(N2O5) for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from α-pinene ozonolysis, finding values that were two orders of magnitude smaller than that of ammonium bisulphate (γ = 1.5 × 10−4) at 50% RH. Even small amounts of α-pinene SOA in ammonium bisulphate led to significant suppression, with γ(N2O5) = 0.3–2.6 × 10−3 for 9–79% mass fraction SOA. Both of the last two studies suggested that the surfactant properties of the organic component were responsible for the strong suppression of the mixed aerosol. Knopf et al. investigated N2O5 uptake to biomass burning tracers, levoglucosan, abeitic acid and nitroguaiacol, finding relatively large uptake coefficients under dry conditions in the range 0.035–0.047.335
Folkers et al.434 first investigated the role of organic coatings on inorganic salts in suppressing γ(N2O5). For coatings of α-pinene SOA (from ozonolysis) on ammonium sulphate and bisulphate, they found a factor of 5–35 reduction in the uptake coefficient for thick (93% of particle volume) and thin (5% of particle volume) coated particles at modest RH (near 60%). However, Anttila et al.398 demonstrated that the reduction was much smaller for coatings made from the oxidation of mixed monoterpenes rather than α-pinene alone. Anttila et al.398 developed a theoretical model using surface resistance to describe these results. Thorton and Abbatt423 showed that a concentration of hexenoic acid equivalent to a monolayer reduced the uptake to aqueous NaCl by a factor of 3–4, while McNeill et al.435 demonstrated that a monolayer equivalent of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) decreased uptake to aqueous NaCl particles by a factor of 10. Park et al.436 used a molecular beam scattering apparatus to show a factor of 2.5 reduction in HNO3 production efficiency for scattering of N2O5 from H2SO4 upon addition of an alcohol surfactant. Knopf et al.,437 Cosman and Bertram,438 and Cosman et al.439 showed that straight chain surfactant addition to H2SO4 suppresses γ(N2O5) by a factor of 17–61, and that the suppression was a factor of ten even if the surfactant coating was less than one monolayer. A branched chain surfactant, however, had no such effect, and even disrupted the effect from the straight chain surfactant in a two-component system.
Finally, black carbon (or soot) is another major atmospheric aerosol type that can participate in heterogeneous chemistry. Longfellow et al.440 exposed soot to N2O5 in a flow tube reactor and determined a γ(N2O5) of 6 × 10−3. The product of the reaction was not HNO3, however, but rather NO2, indicating a different reactive uptake within the soot. Saathoff et al.336 reported an even smaller γ(N2O5) of 4 × 10−6 for reactive uptake to produce NO and NO2 as products, and 4 × 10−5 for hydrolysis. Karagulian and Rossi338 showed an uptake coefficient, γ(N2O5) = 5 × 10−3, similar to that of Longfellow et al.,440 also reporting NO + NO2 as reaction products. Gross and Bertram330 found N2O5 uptake to three types of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to be smaller than 7 × 10−5. Kwamena and Abbatt339 showed evidence for nitration of soot upon exposure to a mixture of NO3 and N2O5. Heal et al.441 also showed evidence for nitration reactions in exposure of phenol solutions to N2O5.

Table 4 summarizes these results for laboratory studies of N2O5 heterogeneous uptake. These studies have shown γ(N2O5) to be relatively large for aqueous inorganic aerosols and water droplets, generally within the range 0.01–0.04 for surface level, tropospheric temperature. The only exception is nitrate, which reverses the solution phase ionization of N2O5 and may lead to a suppression of up to one order of magnitude. Organic aerosol has the potential to suppress γ(N2O5) by as much as two orders of magnitude. Studies that have found the largest suppression have suggested the formation of surfactants or coatings that offer resistance to N2O5 uptake. Parameterizations of γ(N2O5) for use in atmospheric models have been updated within the last decade to reflect some of the newer findings about N2O5 uptake coefficients, but these parameterizations have largely either not included organic aerosol,24,396 or they have not captured the full range of potential suppression due to the organic component.379 The exception is the study of Riemer et al.,389 who explicitly included a parameterization for organic coatings398 and showed a large influence on particulate nitrate formation from N2O5 uptake.

4.3 Field determinations of N2O5 uptake coefficients
The variation of γ(N2O5) from laboratory determinations with aerosol composition, especially that of organic aerosols, means that uptake coefficients on real atmospheric aerosol are difficult to predict. Although several field studies that have included measurements of NO3, N2O5 or other reactive nitrogen species have constrained γ(N2O5), they generally do so only in an average sense. Two methods have been demonstrated for the direct determination of γ(N2O5) on real atmospheric aerosol within specific air masses. Brown et al.143,163,169 have determined uptake coefficients from aircraft measurements that transect urban or power plant plumes from the dependence of the NO3 or N2O5 lifetime with NO2, which regulates the ratio, and therefore the sinks, of NO3 and N2O5. These determinations were described above in Section 2.3, and have generally shown uptake coefficients near 0.02 on sulphate rich aerosol, but much smaller γ(N2O5), as low as 0.001, on mixed organic, sulphate aerosol. Bertram et al.442 developed a flow tube method for measurement of γ(N2O5) directly on ambient aerosol particles, observing the relative change in N2O5 transmitted through a flow tube with and without aerosol present. They contrasted ambient data from summertime in Boulder, CO to fall in Seattle, WA, USA. The Boulder data were uniformly low, with γ(N2O5) ≪ 0.01, and had aerosol with large organic content in low RH air. The Seattle data showed a distinct dependence on the organic to sulphate ratio, varying from γ = 0.035 at low ratios to 0.005 at high ratios (Fig. 14).367 These determinations are broadly consistent with the laboratory measurements described above, but demonstrate the likely influence of organics in ambient aerosol. Riedel et al.443 also reported direct N2O5 reactivity measurements at a polluted coastal site near San Diego, CA, with N2O5 uptake coefficients ranging from 10−3–0.03. The measured uptake coefficients are generally lower than predicted by a parameterization that includes only the effect of aerosol phase NO3− and Cl−, but they did show clear evidence for the nitrate effect.

4.4 N2O5 homogeneous hydrolysis
The preceding sections on both laboratory and field measurements have shown that aerosol uptake of N2O5 is variable and depends on aerosol composition, relative humidity and temperature. The atmospheric lifetime of N2O5 with respect to heterogeneous uptake also depends on the available aerosol surface area, itself a highly variable quantity. This lifetime may range from a few minutes in a humid environment with a large loading of sulphate aerosol, to hours or even days in a dry, organic-dominated, low aerosol surface environment. Even a slow rate coefficient for direct reaction of N2O5 with water vapour would place a lower limit on this lifetime and would be important to the loss of N2O5 if aerosol uptake were slow. N2O5 (g) + H2O (g) → 2HNO3 (g)(R4.10)This direct, homogeneous reaction has been difficult to characterize in the laboratory, in part because even a very slow rate coefficient is of significance due to the ready availability of water vapour in air, and in part because of the difficulty in separating wall effects from gas phase processes during measurements in humidified reactors.
As noted in the introduction to Section 4, the rate coefficient for (R4.10) of 1.3 × 10−20 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 from the early work of Morris and Niki444 was inconsistent with field data, but later work by Tuazon et al.445 and Hjorth et al.487 gave a rate coefficient approximately one order of magnitude lower, 1.3–1.5 × 10−21 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. Mentel et al. and Wahner et al.201,446 later undertook a series of experiments in a large Teflon chamber at varying RH and concluded that the reaction was both first and second order with respect to water vapour. N2O5 (g) + 2H2O (g) → 2HNO3 (g) + H2O (g)(R4.11)They suggested k(4.10) = 2.5 × 10−22 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, and k(4.11) = 1.8 × 10−39 cm6 molecule−2 s−1. This rate coefficient was subsequently incorporated into standard atmospheric chemical kinetics databases.447 This rate coefficient has a large impact, placing a lower limit to the N2O5 lifetime in the atmosphere of approximately 20 minutes at 80% RH and 25 °C. Such a rapid rate of homogeneous hydrolysis would dominate the loss of NO3 and N2O5 in many environments. Indeed, Emmerson and Evans448 have shown the inclusion of the homogeneous reaction to be an important factor that leads to differences between different global models of nitrogen chemistry. Fig. 15 shows the lifetime of N2O5 with respect to the homogeneous hydrolysis rate coefficient of Wahner et al.201 at 298 K and 273 K, the Tuazon et al.445 rate coefficient (linear dependence on water vapour) at 298 K, and the possible range in heterogeneous loss. Maximum heterogeneous loss assumes uptake to sulphate aerosol with γ(N2O5) = 0.02 above 40% RH, linearly decreasing below 40% RH. The maximum dry aerosol surface area is assumed at 500 μm2 cm−3, and is corrected for hygroscopic growth using a recent parameterization.163 Minimum heterogeneous loss uses the uptake coefficient to α-pinene SOA433 and an aerosol surface area of 50 μm2 cm−3. The figure shows that the homogeneous loss parameterizations, if correct, limit the N2O5 lifetime to values near the maximum heterogeneous loss.
 Fig. 15  Comparison of N2O5 lifetimes (h) with respect to loss by parameterizations of the homogeneous reaction with water vapor at different temperatures (lines) and the range of heterogeneous uptake to aerosol (gray shaded area). 
Analysis of recent field measurements has given conflicting results regarding the homogeneous reaction of N2O5. Ambrose et al.200 used this reaction to analyse ambient NO3 measurements and found it to be in better agreement with their data in coastal New England than a model that did not include the homogeneous reaction. Brown et al.163 showed determinations of the N2O5 lifetime that were up to a factor of 10 larger than the minimum lifetime due to homogeneous hydrolysis from aircraft measurement over Texas. Crowley et al.223 showed that the actual homogeneous hydrolysis rate coefficient must be at least a factor of 3 lower than the parameterization from measurements in rural Germany.
Theoretical chemical analyses have indicated that reaction of N2O5 with water may proceed in the gas phase, and that a mechanism involving two water molecules has a lower barrier than for reaction with a single water molecule.449–451 However, these studies predict rate coefficients several orders of magnitude lower than the experiments.452
4.5 Halogen activation from N2O5
Much of the research of the atmospheric chemistry of N2O5 over the last three decades has emphasized its hydrolysis to nitric acid. However, as discussed in Section 4.2 above, reaction of NO2+ in solution with halide anions, particularly Cl−, can lead to formation of nitryl chloride, ClNO2. The net reaction is equivalent to that of N2O5 with HCl to produce equimolar nitryl chloride and nitric acid. N2O5 (g) + HCl (aq) → HNO3 (g) + ClNO2 (g)(R4.12)The reaction was suggested by Cantrell et al.453 and first reported by Tolbert et al.,408 who reacted N2O5 on HCl/ice films and observed the ClNO2 product at low temperature. Finlayson Pitts et al.183 reacted N2O5 on bulk NaCl at room temperature and detected the ClNO2 product by infrared spectroscopy. These authors suggested it could be a large tropospheric source of active chlorine. In a later experiment that defined the yield of ClNO2 from uptake of N2O5 to dry NaCl to be unity, this group also suggested that the process should lead to part per billion levels of ClNO2 in the polluted marine boundary layer at dawn.454 Following overnight production from N2O5, this source would produce chlorine radicals during morning hours due to ClNO2 photolysis with a lifetime of approximately 1 hour. ClNO2 + hν → Cl + NO2(R4.13)A series of laboratory studies followed on production of ClNO2, BrNO2 and Br2 from N2O5 uptake to both Cl− and Br− solutions.30,31,414,420,455–464 Major findings from this work were that the yield for ClNO2 was large from N2O5 uptake to aqueous solutions, that ClNO2 had low uptake to water and Cl− solutions, but measurable uptake to Br− and I− solutions, and that Br2 was the major product of N2O5, ClNO2 or BrNO2 uptake to Br− solutions. Roberts et al.424 also showed that Cl2 was the major product for uptake of N2O5 to acidified chloride containing solutions with pH <2. The latter finding may help to explain observations of Cl2 in the marine boundary layer,465 though further work on this topic is needed.
As noted above in Section 4.2, Behnke et al.,421 Roberts et al.424 and Bertram and Thornton24 determined the ClNO2 yield (Φ(ClNO2)) of ClNO2 from N2O5 uptake as a function of Cl− concentration, [Cl−], in aqueous solutions and determined the relative rate coefficients for reaction of NO2+ (aq) with H2O (l) (k4.4) and Cl− (aq) (k4.9). (4.2)Because k4.9 is some 450 times more rapid than k4.4, even a small amount of aerosol chloride leads to a large yield of ClNO2. For example, for [Cl−] = 0.05 M, which is characteristic of submicron, urban aerosol in an urban, coastal city, the yield of ClNO2, Φ(ClNO2), is near 1/3, indicating that formation of ClNO2 from N2O5 production and loss should be important in these environments.
Although large ClNO2 mixing ratios were predicted from some of the early laboratory studies, there was no direct confirmation of this prediction from field measurements at that time. Model studies of reactive chlorine inventories either disregarded ClNO2 as a tropospheric halogen source,466 or included at most a modest contribution (e.g., annual production of 0.06 Tg year−1).467,468 McFiggans et al.469 did consider this source in a model of coastal marine boundary layer halogen sources, however.
Marine boundary layer field measurements of soluble chloride, which included species such as Cl2 and ClNO2, did indicate the presence of a chloride source other than HCl with a diurnal pattern suggestive of a nighttime source.470 Observations of photolyzable chlorine (photo degradation followed by reaction of Cl with a hydrocarbon to produced a chlorinated compound measurable by gas chromatography) were largely interpreted as being due to Cl2 or HOCl.471,472 Riemer et al.473 showed evidence for Cl oxidation chemistry from measurements of chlorinated oxidation products of isoprene at a polluted coastal site in Houston, TX, but attributed the chlorine to photolysis of emissions from industrial and residential sources.474 Aldener et al.198 estimated the production of ClNO2 in the polluted marine boundary layer from ship-based measurements of N2O5. Under the assumption that N2O5 would exclusively undergo hydrolysis to HNO3 on submicron aerosol (presumed to be of urban origin) but produce ClNO2 with unit yield on supermicron aerosol (presumed to be of marine origin), they predicted at most 50 pptv of integrated overnight ClNO2 production. These assumptions were consistent with those of the global inventory studies.467,468
Osthoff et al.32 presented the first direct, specific measurement of ClNO2 in ambient air in ship based measurements that also included in situ N2O5 by CRDS. These measurements along the U.S. Gulf Coast during the Texas 2006 campaign showed part per billion levels of ClNO2, as had been predicted by the original laboratory work. Measured ClNO2 was consistent with yields of 10–65% from N2O5 uptake, and required uptake to submicron, urban aerosol to explain ClNO2 production rates. These yields are population averages rather than that of ClNO2 from N2O5 uptake to individual particles, which may vary greatly depending on the distribution of chloride across particle sizes. The mixing ratio of ClNO2 present within pollution plumes typically exceeded the available, submicron chloride, and implied the presence of a larger chloride reservoir in the form of gas phase HCl. The latter presumably arose from acid displacement reactions from sea salt aerosol. Extrapolation of the findings from this initial study to the global atmosphere suggested a large tropospheric chlorine source from N2O5 uptake to chloride aerosol of 3.2 Tg year−1. This estimate presumed that all production took place either from ship emissions within the marine boundary layer, or from coastal urban areas (within 50 km of a coastline).
Thornton et al.33 later showed that ClNO2 production was also efficient at inland locations in a wintertime urban plume study in Boulder, CO. At this mid-continental location, 1600 km from the nearest coastline, ClNO2 was always present within the urban plume at night at mixing ratios up to several hundred pptv, consistent with yields of 7–36%. A gas phase HCl reservoir was also required to justify chlorine mass balance for these observations. A new global estimate that included reactive nitrogen emissions and chloride concentrations from both marine and inland sources suggested a global source of 8–22 Tg Cl year−1 from ClNO2 production (Fig. 16). This is a significant fraction of the 25 ± 12 Tg Cl year−1 tropospheric Cl budget inferred from observations of the long-term seasonal cycle in methane isotopomers in remote regions,475,476 although the methane determination may not be sensitive to production of photolabile Cl sources in urban areas that may react primarily with hydrocarbons other than methane. Later mid-continental measurements within the urban plume of Calgary, Canada,477 confirmed the efficient production of ClNO2 in this environment, with a modelled yield of 15% from N2O5 uptake. Chloride in that study was inferred to come from a local urban source rather than from long-range transport from the Pacific Ocean, some 800 km distant.

The recent CalNex field intensive in Los Angeles, CA in 2010 included ship, ground and aircraft based measurements of both ClNO2 and N2O5. Results from this study have only begun to be reported. Riedel et al.478 and Wagner et al.479 report ship based measurements off of the California coastline, with a focus on polluted air transported over water during the nighttime land breeze near Santa Monica, CA. They found ClNO2 mixing ratios up to 2.1 ppbv but much smaller N2O5 mixing ratios, as well as evidence for Cl2 production that was sometimes correlated with ClNO2 and sometimes not. Although ClNO2 production was efficient in this NOx and Cl− rich environment, much of it occurred over land within the Los Angles basin and was transported over water to the ship rather than being produced over water.
One impact of efficient N2O5 to ClNO2 conversion within urban areas is the potential for enhanced photochemical ozone formation. Morning photolysis of ClNO2 is both a Cl radical and NOx source that can initiate ozone photochemistry. Regional air quality model studies have indicated considerable sensitivity of ozone photochemistry to urban, photo-labile Cl sources.474,480,481 Osthoff et al.32 presented a box model that indicated up to 7 ppbv additional ozone production from the addition of measured ClNO2 levels to polluted air from their study in Houston. Later regional model studies, while demonstrating that ClNO2 was likely the dominant Cl source in the region,482 found only a 1–2 ppbv influence on photochemical ozone,483 however. McLaren et al.205 correlated next-day ozone with integrated overnight N2O5 production, a proxy for ClNO2, for sites along the southern British Columbia coastline. They found a significant correlation that attributed 1–8 ppbv ozone to nighttime ClNO2 in that region. The recent model study of Sarwar et al.484 examined air quality impacts due to ClNO2 throughout the U.S., finding only a 1–2 ppbv impact on 8 hour ozone on the U.S. East coast. Further model studies and analysis of existing field data will be required to fully define this potential impact.
None of the model studies of ozone production have been corroborated by detailed investigation of the time dependence of ozone production in areas likely to be impacted by ClNO2 formation. Nor has the potential impact on peroxy radicals during morning hours received detailed experimental investigation. These aspects of the impact of ClNO2 on radical budgets and regional ozone require further study in future field campaigns.
Finally, global model studies have yet to incorporate ClNO2 or its impacts on tropospheric reactive nitrogen and oxidants. Updates to these studies will be important in light of the more recent laboratory and field data.
5. Conclusions and future research
Much progress has been made in our understanding of the chemistry of nocturnal radical species in the atmosphere. While some parts of this chemical system, such as the stratospheric chemistry, seems to be well understood today, the past decade has identified a number of new, previously poorly known features of nocturnal chemistry. This includes the important interaction of NO3 and N2O5 with aerosol, the formation of reactive chlorine compounds, the altitude dependence of nocturnal chemistry, and others discussed here. The thorough literature review presented here clearly identifies several aspects of this chemical system that require future research:
Our current understanding points to a highly altitude dependent chemical system at night. However, the sparse observational dataset and the difficulties in modelling the entire vertical extent of the nocturnal atmosphere have inhibited a better understanding of the impact of NO3 and N2O5 chemistry. Further observations of all chemical and meteorological parameters are needed to better constrain this system. In parallel, improvements of current chemistry and transport models with respect to the meteorology and chemistry at night are highly desirable.
The presence of significant levels of NO3 and N2O5 in the free troposphere has been shown through remote sensing and aircraft observations. Nevertheless little effort has been made to fully understand this system and its potential impact on long-range transport of NOx, processing of aerosol, and the general impact of nocturnal chemistry on the composition of the free troposphere.
There remains a disagreement of the significance of NO3 chemistry for the global sulphur cycle between various modelling studies. This can, in part be attributed to an incomplete understanding of the DMS degradation chain, but also to the lack of observations in marine regions, in particular away from coastal locations.
The interaction of NO3 radicals with organic aerosol has been identified as a potential pathway to “age” these particles, thus changing their chemical and physical properties. While the transformation of organic aerosol can impact the climatic and human health impact of aerosol, little information from field observations is available and the number of laboratory studies is still sparse.
Despite the progress in understanding the aerosol uptake of N2O5 the ability to reconcile atmospheric observations with laboratory measurements and model parameterization remains poorly developed. The reasons for this discrepancy remain unclear, but likely include the organic part of the aerosol and the influence of organic films on particles. Further laboratory work on complex mixtures of organic and inorganic aerosols, along with a larger data base of field observations, are urgently needed to provide better parameterizations of N2O5 uptake and to better understand the nocturnal loss of NOx in the atmosphere. Further investigation is also required to determine if homogeneous N2O5 hydrolysis is in fact important in the ambient atmosphere.
The observation of elevated ClNO2 mixing ratios in the field has revived the discussion of the significance of chlorine for atmospheric oxidation chemistry. It is clear that this chemistry is occurring not only in marine areas, but also over the continents, and is thus likely to be of global significance. Many parts of this system remain poorly understood, including the efficiency of ClNO2 formation across a broad range of environments, the sources of chloride and its partitioning between gas and aerosol phase, and the relationship to the formation of other halogens, such as Cl2. In addition, the impact of this chemistry on local and regional air quality has been investigated in only a limited number of model studies, and the impact on global oxidant levels has yet to be addressed. Further experimental work on ozone formation rates, VOC oxidation and peroxy radical production is required to fully understand the impact of this recently discovered radical source.
Various laboratory studies have shown that NO3 + biogenic VOC reactions efficiently form secondary organic aerosol particles. These laboratory studies remain few in number compared to investigations of biogenic VOC oxidation by O3 and OH. Some regional and global models predict large SOA formation from NO3–biogenic VOC reactions, but there is little information to constrain the magnitude of the process from field observations. Further, focused field experiment would provide critical tests for these model predictions.
There remain discrepancies between models and measurements of nighttime peroxy radicals and OH, especially with respect to the peroxy radical source predicted from reactions of NO3 with biogenic VOCs and DMS. Better measurements of this system, along with better analytical tools for peroxy radical measurements, particularly those associated with DMS, are required.
Finally, further study of nocturnal radical chemistry seems warranted to better assess the consequences of future changes in anthropogenic emissions on ozone, NOx, and aerosol levels on local, regional, and global scales.

Steven S. Brown
	Steven S. Brown received a PhD in physical chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and came to NOAA in 1997 as an NRC post-doctoral fellow. His major research theme at NOAA has been the chemistry and impacts of nitrogen oxides in the Earth's atmosphere, with and emphasis on field measurements of tropospheric nitrogen oxides, particularly those that occur in the dark (“nighttime chemistry”). His other main research interest has been the development of high sensitivity optical instrumentation for laboratory and field studies of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols.

Jochen Stutz
	Jochen Stutz received his PhD in physics from the University of Heidelberg in 1996. After working as a postdoctoral researcher at University of California Irvine and University of Heidelberg, he joined the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at University of California Los Angeles as a faculty member in 1999. His research group studies the chemical and meteorological processes controlling nocturnal boundary layer composition, and the chemistry of reactive nitrogen species and reactive halogen species in the atmosphere using observations and model calculations. He has published over 75 scientific articles, and recently co-authored a book on Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy.
