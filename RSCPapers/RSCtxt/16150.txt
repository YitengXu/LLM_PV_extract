    , Accepted 15th August 2022First published on 16th August 2022AbstractAgriculture is a major user of ground and surface water, accounting for ∼70% of the world's freshwater withdrawals. The rising agricultural water demand potentially leads to a conflict with water use among urban, industrial and agricultural sectors. It also threatens food security, human life and the environment worldwide. The urgent need for alternative water resources motivates the exploration of atmospheric water as an abundant and untapped source of freshwater for irrigated agriculture. Herein, kelp-derived hydrogel beads with self-contained properties (i.e., hygroscopic, photothermal, temperature-responsive and durable) are developed via shape-controlled and mass fabrication. The hygroscopic beads attain maximum water uptake of over 5.0 g g−1 under 90% relative humidity (RH). Synergistic photothermal heating and temperature-driven phase transition afford multi-modal water desorption and efficient water release. Over 95% of absorbed water can be rapidly released under a broad solar intensity of 0.6–1 sun and temperature range of 40–60 °C. A solar-powered and sorption-based seed propagator is developed and demonstrated to sustain the plant germination and growth, taking the advantages of the hydrogel beads' reversible moisture sorption/desorption in night/day cycles, the high quality of irrigation water, net-zero energy consumption and thermal management in a system-level design. This work provides a perspective on controlled and mass fabrication of hygroscopic hydrogels. It highlights the solar-powered atmospheric water irrigation for electricity-free and sustainable agriculture regardless of varied geographical and hydrologic conditions.
1. Introduction
Freshwater scarcity is an ever-growing concern for sustaining human life and the environment. So far, human and environmental demands for freshwater have been outstripping the water supply. A recent report estimates that 1.8–2.9 billion people are suffering from severe water scarcity for at least 4–6 months per year and half a billion people are facing water scarcity all the year.1 Agriculture production is by far the largest using sector, accounting for ∼85% of human water consumption and ∼70% of all freshwater withdrawals globally.2 Agriculture is highly water-dependent and subject to water risks. Surface water, groundwater and rainwater are three typical sources of agricultural production, which account for ∼0.6% of all water on earth. Compared to rain-fed agriculture, centralized gravity and pressurized systems are the common methods used to apply irrigation water to crops, delivering higher productivity per unit of land.3 Population growth, urbanization, climate changes, water contamination and desertification have worsened the agricultural water situation by altering hydrological cycles and diminishing surface and groundwater reserves.4 More competing demands (i.e., municipal, industrial uses and environmental flows) for unpredictable water resources lay increasing stress on water management, irrigated agriculture and food production. Our world is demanding advanced irrigation solutions and alternative sources of liquid water supply, which are essential to recharge water and soil reserves, and to sustain an energy-efficient and productive food sector.5–9
Solar-powered irrigation systems are considered a green revolution in decentralized and off-grid farming.10 They deliver a sustainable lifestyle, locate food production, benefit many small farms with limited land (i.e., urban, semi-arid and arid areas), and offer a promising solution to the “water-energy-livelihood” dilemma. Typical solar-powered irrigation systems deploy solar panels to power water pumps that transport water to crops.11 Encouragingly, recent years have witnessed the emerging use of a new water resource – atmospheric water, delivering a sustainable freshwater supply for drinking and agricultural needs. ∼12900 cubic kilometers of water is constantly preserved in the earth's atmosphere in a gaseous state (vapor) and in a condensed state (clouds and fog), which is equivalent to ∼0.04% of all freshwater sources.12 The atmosphere also serves as a superhighway in the hydrologic cycle and moves freshwater around the globe. In general, there are two types of fog/dew harvesting methods: passive and active.13,14 Passive fog/dew condensers rely on accelerating water droplet formation and growth via several biomimicking techniques.15–17 Based on the emerging of next-generation hygroscopic materials, sorbent-based atmospheric water generators (AWGs) enable a passive method to capture water vapor from surrounding air.18–23 Compared to typical passive approaches (i.e., fog and dew condensers), sorbent-based AWGs significantly reduce geographical and climatic effects (i.e., sky emissivity, humidity, wind speed and topographic location), boosting water production yields in relatively dry air and low temperature.24–27 Incorporating hygroscopic materials with photothermal or radiative cooling materials, sorbent-based AWGs can release water and regenerate under natural sunlight with low energy intake.28–32
Sunlight is the largest energy source for our planet. Without the need for centralized power and water infrastructure, solar-powered and sorbent-based AWGs hold the promise for the development of grid-down and electricity-free clean water production. In this perspective, the irrigation demand of off-grid farms (i.e., in urban, remote and water-stressed areas) can be fulfilled by atmospheric water harvest, providing a great prospect in combatting both fresh water and food insecurity.33,34 So far, the efforts to seek high-performing hygroscopic materials with rapid water vapor sorption, high water vapor uptake, low regeneration temperature and sustainable energy input are rising.35–45 Incorporation of emerging desiccants (i.e., hygroscopic salts, metal–organic complex, metal–organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks) within porous matrices (i.e., aerogels, hydrogels, films, fabrics and sponges) is of particular interest.46–67 Although atmospheric water is considered as a promising solution for the growing scarcity in agriculture, few sorption-based AWGs have been developed for the specific use in solar-powered irrigation.7,33,34 Design of integrated AWG systems for energy-efficient, water-saving and self-sustaining agriculture is still beyond reach. Important questions on materials, devices and characterization remain elusive: (i) how to recycling and processing biomass and waste materials into high value-added products and to reuse them in agricultural operations;39,68,69 (ii) how to realize sharp-controlled, mass and continuous fabrication of hybrid hygroscopic materials;70–73 (iii) the lack of accurate and timely data to evaluate the water uptake of AWGs in day/night cycles and (iv) future design of AWGs is highly desired to allocate water sources, meeting varied water demands of plant's life cycles.
In this contribution, hydrogel beads were fabricated through rational incorporation of marine-biomass-derived polysaccharide (sodium alginate, SA), thermo-responsive polymer (poly(N-isopropylacrylamide, PNIPAM), hygroscopic salt (calcium chloride, CaCl2) and photothermal dye (Fig. 1). In situ polymerization of NIPAM monomers and simultaneous cross-linking of SA in a warm CaCl2 solution triggered rapid gelation of composite hydrogels under mild conditions. Incorporation of PNIPAM building blocks endowed the composite hydrogels with thermo-responsive properties at low temperature (34.9 °C). The extensive ionic bonding, electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonding stabilized all structural components throughout the double-network (DN) hydrogels, leading to continuous manufacturing and shape-controlled fabrication of cross-linked SA/PNIPAM beads (named cl-SP beads). Efficient water vapor sorption was recorded in a broad relative humidity (RH) range of 40–90%. Maximum water uptake of over 5.0 g g−1 was achieved under 90% RH. Synergistic photothermal heating and temperature-driven phase transition of cl-SP beads generated multi-modal water desorption, exhibiting efficient clean water release under a broad solar intensity (0.6–1 sun) and temperature range (40–60 °C). Taking the benefits of the reversible water vapor sorption and desorption in night/day cycles, a solar-powered “seed propagator” was developed for self-sustaining plant cultivation. The cl-SP beads captured atmospheric water during the nighttime, released the adsorbed water during the daytime and irrigated the plants with no liquid water supply. The received fresh water sustained the germination, growth and survival rates of the plants in the whole growth stage. This work highlights the great potential of hygroscopic, photothermal and temperature-responsive hydrogels based on biomass-derived materials for energy-efficient and self-sustaining agricultural applications.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Fabrication and characterization of hydrogel beads
Different genera of brown algae known as kelps (order Laminariales) are globally essential foundation species and can grow in large offshore forests in shallow oceans. Kelps are among the most prolific primary producers on the planet and occupy ∼43% of the world's marine ecoregions along the coastlines worldwide, forming dense forests and biogenic habitats with high growth rates and biodiversity. Products from kelps can be used in health food, biofuels and substitutes for plastic products from fossil fuels. A strong upscaling of the kelp cultivation industry is on the way worldwide. In China, kelp cultivation in the Yellow Sea is used as the primary source for alginate production, exhibiting one of the largest maricultural crops in the world. Alginates are cell-wall constituents and the dominant polysaccharides of kelps, widely used as stabilizers and emulsifiers in the food industry. The use of alginates become more popular in biomedical and bioengineering applications due to the gelling ability, biocompatibility, biodegradability and biological activity. Interestingly, the principal functions of alginates in agricultural applications are as a functional element of the fertilizers and as a soil conditioner.74
Sodium alginate (SA) was extracted from the giant kelps (Saccharina japonica) and formed the water-retaining networks in the hydrogels. The crude kelps were harvested easily on the coast of the Yellow Sea, Qingdao, China. Extraction of SA from kelps consists of three major steps: (i) pre-extraction, (ii) neutralization and (iii) precipitation/purification, as illustrated in Fig. S1, ESI.† The linear backbones of SA contained two building blocks, including β-D-mannuronic acid (M) and α-L-guluronic acid (G) linked by 1 → 4 glycosidic bonds, exhibiting four polymer chain conformations (MM, GG, MG and GM blocks) (Fig. S2, ESI†). The M/G ratio in the extracted SA was ∼1.6, which was estimated via proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. S3, ESI†). This M/G value is in the range (M/G = ∼0.5–2.0) of many commercial SA. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy exhibits that the same characteristic peaks (i.e., 3290, 1600 and 1027 cm−1) were obtained from as-prepared and commercial SA, indicating successful extraction of SA from kelp (Fig. S4, ESI†).
Temperature-responsive PNIPAM was synthesized as the second building block and incorporated with different amounts of SA, forming double-network (DN) structures in the composite hydrogels. An ultra-black and water-soluble acrylic dye widely used in the artistic community was employed to color the composite hydrogels. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, SA, N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and black dye were dissolved in water and formed a mixed gel. The fluid-like gel was added dropwise into the warm aqueous solution (∼50 °C) of CaCl2via a peristaltic pump. Cross-linking of SA and in situ polymerization of NIPAM synergistically occurred, forming intertwined DN structures and triggering the gelation of cl-SP beads in a short period (∼30 min). The mechanism of cross-linking and in situ polymerization depicts numerous ionic, hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals force throughout SA and PNIPAM, interlocking the DN structures in cl-SP beads (Fig. 2b). CaCl2 is one of the most frequently used reagents to cross-link SA ionically. The divalent cations (Ca2+) were embedded into the GG blocks formed by two adjacent SA chains via ionic bonds, exhibiting the helical conformation with “egg-box” structures in the SA matrix.72 The feed mass ratios of SA and NIPAM varied from 1:5 to 5:5, which aimed to screen the ideal proportion of SA and PNIPAM in cl-SP beads exhibiting superior mechanical and hygroscopic properties. Taking the benefits of mild and rapid gelation, the continuous manufacturing process can provide shape-controlled cl-SP beads with varied diameters ranging from 2 to 5 mm, highlighting the continuous, mass and controlled fabrication of cl-SP beads (Fig. 1 and ESI, video S1†).

2.2 Water vapor sorption and desorption at indoor conditions
SA is a hygroscopic and water-retaining biopolymer, which can afford a saturated water content of 0.35 g g−1 under 90% RH (Fig. S5, ESI†). SA polymer chains contain numerous hydrophilic groups (i.e., carboxylate salts and hydroxyl groups), which can interact with water molecules via hydrogen bonds. The neat PNIPAM polymer is non-hygroscopic, exhibiting negligible water vapor sorption in the humid air. CaCl2 is a highly hygroscopic halide. Thermodynamic drive (exothermic) allows water molecules to bond with Ca2+ and accumulate water molecules in the crystal lattices of CaCl2 (known as hydration). In situ polymerization of NIPAM and gelation of SA in the CaCl2 solution maximized the contact areas among the three components, forming solid cl-SP beads. SA and CaCl2 endowed dry cl-SP beads with water-retaining and hygroscopic properties in humid air (Fig. 3a). Compressive tests were performed to study the mechanical properties of the cl-SP hydrogels. A gradually applied load was performed on each hydrogel until its structure fractured at a compressive strength limit. The compressive stress–strain curves are plotted in Fig. 3b. Notably, all cl-SP composite hydrogels (cylindric samples, diameter: ∼12 mm, height: ∼10 mm) showed higher compressive strength than the Ca2+ cross-linked SA hydrogel (named ALG-Ca). It indicates that the cross-linked DN structures can improve the mechanical properties of cl-SP composite hydrogels against deformation. Among the five composite hydrogels, the maximum compressive strength and strain were recorded from the hydrogel with a SA/NIPAM ratio of 3:5.

Indoor water vapor sorption kinetics of cl-SP beads was evaluated, considering component ratios (SA, PNIPAM and dye) of materials, bead sizes, 3D geometric shapes and RH of surrounding air. Without dyeing, ALG-Ca and cl-SP composite beads (average diameter: ∼2.5 mm) were measured under 90% RH and 25 °C. The water uptake as a function of time was plotted in Fig. 3c. Neat ALG-Ca beads afforded a saturated water content of 4.30 g g−1 after 24 h. The cl-SP beads with the SA/NIPAM proportions of 1:5 and 2:5 showed lower water contents than ALG-Ca after 24 h. Further increases in the SA loading enhanced the water vapor sorption of the cl-SP beads, outperforming the ALG-Ca beads. The cl-SP bead with a SA/NIPAM ratio of 3:5 attained a maximum water content of 4.84 g g−1 under 90% RH after 24 h. Under a low RH of 40%, the cl-SP beads (SA/NIPAM = 3:5) reached a steady state in 12 h. They afforded a saturated water content of 1.79 g g−1, indicating the efficient water vapor sorption at low humid conditions (Fig. 3d). The cl-SP beads gave a saturated water content of 2.90 g g−1 under moderate RH of 60%. Introduction of black dyes (2% and 6%, w/w) showed negligible effects on water vapor sorption of the cl-SP beads (SA/NIPAM = 3:5, average diameter: ∼2.5 mm), resulting in comparable water content of ∼4.76 g g−1 after 24 h (Fig. S6, ESI†). Based on the idea proportion of SA/NIPAM/dye (SA/NIPAM = 3:5, 6% dye), different cl-SP beads were made, ranging in size from ∼2 to ∼5 mm and their water vapor sorption was measured. Notably, ∼3 mm diameter cl-SP beads attained the maximum water content and further improved the water uptake to 5.00 g g−1 under 90% RH after 24 h (Fig. S7, ESI†).
Water vapor sorption kinetics of cl-SP beads can be expressed using eqn (1) and (2),23,39,42 (1) (2)where Rs (h−1) is the water vapor sorption rate, m (g) is the weight of hydrated cl-SP beads at time t (h) and m0 is the weight of dry cl-SP beads (g). xeq (g g−1) is the equilibrium water content of cl-SP beads, x (g g−1) is the water content of hydrated cl-SP beads at time t (h) and k (h−1) is the water sorption rate coefficient. Among all single- and dual-component beads, the cl-SP beads (SA/NIPAM = 3:5, 6% dye, diameter: ∼3 mm) afforded a maximum Rs of 0.208 h−1 under 90% RH in 24 h (Table S1, ESI†). A gradual decline of k was obtained when RH increased from 40% to 90%. Similar results were found in previous reports.42 As RH increased, the water vapor sorption changed from solid to liquid sorption mechanisms, reducing mass transfer rates and k (Fig. S8 and Table S2, ESI†).
In order to evaluate how the shapes of hydrogels affect water vapor sorption, spherical, cylindric, triangular and cuboid hydrogels were made from the cl-SP composite (SA/NIPAM = 3:5, 6% dye). The same weight (0.5 g) of crude materials was used in each structure (Fig. 3e). Among the four composite hydrogels, a maximum water content of 3.50 g g−1 was recorded from the bead under 90% RH after 24 h, which surpassed the water content of the other three hydrogels (Fig. 3f). The specific surface areas (the areas exposed to air) of all hydrogels are calculated and summarized in Table S3.† Notably, the cl-SP bead showed a larger specific surface area (8.30 cm2 g−1) than other hydrogels (less than 5.0 cm2 g−1). The relatively large specific surface area played a role in its superior water vapor sorption because more water molecules can be captured per unit area in unit time.
Water vapor sorption isotherms of cl-SP beads (SA/NIPAM = 3:5, 6% dye, average diameter: ∼3 mm) were measured under different RH (25–90%) and air temperatures (25–60 °C) (Fig. 3g). The cl-SP beads showed encouraging equilibrium water uptake of ∼0.58 g g−1 under low RH (25%) and at ambient temperature (25 °C) (Fig. S9, ESI†), highlighting the ability of water vapor harvesting of cl-SP beads even at low humidity conditions. The water vapor sorption was significantly enhanced under higher humidity (40–90% RH), since more water molecules can be captured per unit time. High equilibrium water uptake of ∼5.22 g g−1 was attained under 90% RH and at 25 °C (Fig. S10, ESI†). Under each RH, the water vapor sorption decreased at higher temperatures (45 and 65 °C). The result indicates that the dehydration and regeneration of cl-SP beads can occur under mild heating and in a broad temperature range.
Chemical components of ideal cl-SP beads (SA/NIPAM = 3:5, 6% dye) were characterized via FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the FTIR curve of ALG-Ca, the broad absorption band at 3200–3600 cm−1 corresponded to the O–H stretching vibration of –OH groups (Fig. 4a). The sharp peaks at 1623 and 1030 cm−1 corresponded to the C–O stretching vibration of –COOH groups and the symmetric stretching vibration of C–O–C linkages on SA, respectively. In the FTIR curve of PNIPAM, the peak at 1642 cm−1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of CO group. The sharp peak at 1550 cm−1 stemmed from the N–H deformation and C–N stretching vibration. Most characteristic peaks of AlG-Ca and PNIPAM can be found in the FTIR curve of the cl-SP composite, indicating that these two structural components were incorporated into the cl-SP composite. Surface chemical analysis of cl-SP was performed via XPS. The full-scale XPS spectrum showed O 1s, N 1s, Ca 2p, C 1s and Cl 2p peaks with the binding energies of 532.01, 399.52, 347.35, 284.58 and 198.00 eV, respectively (Fig. 4b). The N 1s spectrum of the cl-SP composite stemmed from the PNIPAM component. The Ca 2p spectrum of the cl-SP composite stemmed from CaCl2 and ALG-Ca. Deconvolution of the Ca 2p spectrum showed two characteristic subpeaks, including Ca 2p1/2 (350.9 eV) and Ca 2p3/2 (343.4 eV) (Fig. S11a, ESI†). Deconvolution of the C 1s spectrum showed characteristic subpeaks of SA (O–CO at 288.3 eV and C–O at 285.8 eV) and PNIPAM (C–N at 286.2 eV and N–CO at 287.6 eV) (Fig. S11b, ESI†). The FTIR and XPS characterization confirm the formation of the SA and PNIPAM composite in the cl-SP bead after the in situ polymerization and cross-linking reactions. Dynamic rheological testing was conducted to study the flow behavior and deformation of SN-based ALG-Ca and DN-based cl-SP hydrogels (Fig. 4c). For viscoelastic materials, storage modulus (G′) represents the stored deformation energy in an elastic behavior. Loss modulus (G′′) reflects the deformation energy lost through the internal friction of structural components. Under a frequency sweep, ALG-Ca and cl-SP hydrogels presented elastic-like behavior (G′ > G′′), indicating the formation of interlocked networks throughout the polymer matrices.9 Under the stress and strain sweep, similar G′ and G′′ curves were also recorded below the critical stress and strain, respectively (Fig. S12a and b, ESI†). The comparable G′ and G′′ of ALG-Ca and cl-SP suggests that incorporation of the proper amount of PNIPAM retained the pristine SA networks.

PNIPAM is an amphiphilic polymer, which contains a hydrophilic amide group and a hydrophobic isopropyl group in each building block of the polymer chains. At low temperatures, the amide groups on the PNIPAM chains form numerous hydrogen bonds with water molecules and the negative enthalpy term dominates the Gibbs free energy. The PNIPAM chains exist in an expanded coil state. As the temperature increases, the hydrogen bonded network is gradually weakened and the entropy term dominates. Eventually, the collapse of hydrogel bonds occurs across the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The PNIPAM chains undergo a “coil-to-globule” transition, exhibiting inverse solubility in aqueous solutions.75 The phase transition of PNIPAM is reversible due to the non-covalent interaction (hydrogel bonding) and flexible chain conformation. The incorporation of PNIPAM with SA enables us to introduce the thermal-sensitive property of PNIPAM to the cl-SP hydrogels in this study. Temperature–responsive properties of cl-SP beads were characterized via ultra-macro photography, water contact angle (CA) measurements and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Neat PNIPAM gels and ALG-Ca beads were also measured for comparison. Temperature-driven shape changes of the cl-SP beads were photographed via a digital camera with an ultra-macro lens (Fig. 4d). The water-saturated cl-SP beads showed an average diameter of ∼2.5 mm at room temperature. Heat shrinkage of the cl-SP beads was observed when the ambient temperature gradually raised from 25 to 50 °C, indicating that the ambient temperature passed through LCST of the cl-SP beads (ESI, video S2†). Water contact angle (CA) measurements showed that the ALG-Ca retained good wettability on its surface at both 25 and 50 °C (Fig. 4e). On the other hand, the cl-SP composite underwent a distinct transition from hydrophilic (25 °C) to a relatively hydrophobic surface (50 °C) across LCST. LCST of the cl-SP composite can be determined via DSC. Neat PNIPAM and the cl-SP composite showed the same endothermic peaks at 34.9 °C during heating, indicating the phase transition induced by the PNIPAM component (Fig. 4f). For solar-powered dehydration of the cl-SP composite, a low LCST (<40 °C) is critical to ensure efficient water release under real sky with moderate sunlight intensity (below 1 sun).48,51
A cyclic compression experiment was conducted to evaluate the deformation and durability of the cl-SP hydrogel via a high-precision mechanical testing system.76 The loading and unloading processes were repeated over time under a constant strain of 20%. The overlapped hysteresis loops of the cl-SP hydrogel indicate its good deformation resistance and rapid self-recovering ability (Fig. S13a, ESI†). The compressive stress–time curve of the cl-SP hydrogel showed a small decrease in the compressive stress over 30 loading/releasing cycles (Fig. S13b, ESI†). The cl-SP hydrogel can retain ∼88.8% of the maximum stress and exhibit negligible plastic deformation (∼5.2%) over the cyclic compression.
High and broad light absorption is another essential requirement for photothermal conversion. UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy shows that the cl-SP composite (SA/NIPAM = 3:5, 2% dye) can afford a broad absorptance of ∼85.0% in the wavelength region of 250–2500 nm, spanning over the entire solar spectrum (Fig. S14, ESI†). The cl-SP composite with 6% dye exhibited a higher absorptance of ∼96.5% in the same wavelength region, indicating that higher content of dye can improve light absorption of cl-SP beads.
Interior and surface morphologies of ALG-Ca and cl-SP beads were characterized via scanning electron microscope (SEM). ALG-Ca beads were semitransparent (Fig. 5a) and exhibited solid structures via the surface and cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 5b and c). The dense ALG-Ca beads showed an average wet density of 1.31 g cm−3 as measured via a high-precision density meter. The as-prepared cl-SP beads were white and opaque (Fig. 5d). The acrylic reagent dyed the cl-SP beads from white to black, exhibiting no structural deformation (Fig. 5e). Similar to the ALG-Ca beads, the dyed cl-SP beads also showed solid structures (Fig. 5f and h). However, more wrinkled and fiber-like structures were observed on the surface of cl-SP beads (Fig. 5g). Its lower wet density of 1.11 g cm−3 also agreed well with the morphological characterization. Nitrogen (N) is a characteristic element in PNIPAM. The elemental mapping at the microstructural level obtained from the energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) shows that C, N, O, Cl and Ca were evenly distributed throughout the cl-SP bead (Fig. 5i and S15, ESI†). The result indicates the homogeneous distribution of PNIPAM throughout the SA matrix and was in good agreement with the FTIR and XPS characterization.

PNIPAM and black dye endowed hydrated cl-SP beads with temperature-responsive and photothermal properties under solar illumination. After water vapor sorption, water-saturated cl-SP beads (SA/NIPAM = 3:5, 6% dye, average diameter: ∼3 mm, weight: 0.5 g) were overlaid on a Petri dish (diameter: 3 cm) and solar-powered or heat-driven dehydration were evaluated. Phase transition (from hydrophilic to hydrophobic state) and solar-to-vapor conversion triggered efficient steam generation (gaseous state) and water release (liquid state) of cl-SP beads, as illustrated in Fig. 6a. Mass changes of cl-SP beads were characterized using an artificial setup. Under solar illumination, the surface temperature of wet cl-SP beads showed a sharp increase within 15 min, followed by a mild increase and it reached a steady state after hours (Fig. 6b). Under 1 sun (1000 W m−2), the surface temperature of cl-SP beads rapidly increased across LCST (34.9 °C) and reached to ∼45 °C in the first 10 min. A high surface temperature of over ∼60 °C was reached after 2 h (Fig. 6c). The solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency was calculated to be 71.5% under 1 sun, which significantly surpasses the solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of bare water (∼30%).77 It is noted that the maximum solar intensity is generally ∼800 W m−2 on a sunny day (Qingdao, China). Under moderate solar intensity (0.6 sun), the surface temperature of cl-SP beads gradually increased across LCST after 3 h, indicating that the phase transition and water release of cl-SP beads can be triggered under real sky for practical applications.

Owing to the solar-driven phase transition and water release, the water content of cl-SP beads gradually declined over time (Fig. 6d). Water desorption kinetics of the cl-SP beads can be expressed using eqn (3) and (4),44 (3) (4)where Pd (%) is the percentage of desorbed water mass to initial absorbed water mass. Rd (h−1) is the water desorption rate, ms (g) is the weight of the water-saturated cl-SP beads, m (g) is the weight of dehydrated cl-SP beads at time t (h) and m0 (g) is the weight of dry cl-SP beads. Moderate sunlight (0.6 sun) enabled the wet cl-SP beads to release over 98% of the adsorbed water within 5 h, exhibiting a Rd of 0.196 h−1 (Table S4, ESI†). Water desorption of the wet cl-SP beads was accelerated under increased solar intensity. Under 1 sun, ∼97% of the absorbed water in the cl-SP beads was released within 3 h. Negligible water content was found after 5 h, yielding a higher Rd of 0.213 h−1. Water desorption of neat ALG-Ca beads was characterized as a control group (Fig. S16, ESI†). Under 0.6 sun, the ALG-Ca beads released ∼91% of the adsorbed water within 5 h, exhibiting a moderate Rd of 0.137 h−1. Under 1 sun, ∼92% of the absorbed water in the ALG-Ca beads was released in 3 h. ∼98% of the absorbed water was released in 5 h, yielding a Rd of 0.198 h−1. Notably, both Rd of the ALG-Ca beads were lowered than the cl-SP beads under 0.6 and 1 sun. The results reveal that introduction of PNIPAM and its phase transition at a proper LCST (34.9 °C) can afford efficient water desorption under a wide range of solar intensity (0.6–1 sun), delivering enhanced water release in both quantity (Pd) and rate (Rd) compared to neat ALG-Ca beads. The Ca2+ crosslinked SA component mainly served as the water-retaining and toughening agent in the cl-SP hydrogel. The PNIPAM component should play a vital role in the phase transition of the cl-SP hydrogel. The hydrogen-bonding interactions between the hydrophilic groups of PNIPAM, SA and water molecules were dominant below LCST. When the temperature was raised above LCST, the solvation entropy of the hydrophobic groups in PNIPAM dominated and the hydrophobic groups (i.e., isopropyl groups) in PNIPAM tended to associate.78 The physical conformational changes of PNIPAM resulted in the hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic transition of the cl-SP hydrogel.35 As a result, deswelling and water expulsion were observed from the cl-SP hydrogel when the temperature exceeded 34.9 °C.
Associated with the solar-powered water release, temperature-controlled water release of the cl-SP beads was also characterized in a range of 23–60 °C, which referred to the temperature zone obtained under 0.6–1 sun (Fig. 6e). At 23, 25 and 30 °C, ∼75%, ∼78% and ∼82% of absorbed water were released in 12 h, affording Rd of 0.236, 0.244 and 0.257 h−1, respectively (Table S5, ESI†). The results indicate that water desorption of cl-SP beads can occur at room temperature. Higher temperature (40, 50 and 60 °C) over LCST (34.9 °C) significantly improved the water release of cl-SP beads in both capacity and rates. In this broad temperature range, over 95% of the absorbed water was released within 4 h, exhibiting temperature-independent water desorption and yielding a comparable Rd of ∼0.31 h−1.
In order to further understand the improved water release induced by PNIPAM, the water removal energy of the cl-SP hydrogel below and above LCST were evaluated based on the Arrhenius plots. The water evaporation profile of cl-SP hydrogel showed two temperature regions divided at LCST, indicating that the mechanisms for water release below and above LCST were distinct (Fig. S17a, ESI†). The activation energy (Ea) for the water release below LCST was calculated to be 121.9 kJ mol−1, which was comparable to Ea for the bare water evaporation (Fig. S17b, ESI†). On the other hand, Ea for the water release above LCST was as low as 3.8 kJ mol−1, implying that the water release above LCST was governed by the expulsion process of the weakly bound water molecules at the solid/liquid interface.35,49 The result discloses that liquid water can be removed from cl-SP beads with low energy consumption.
In order to assess clean water generation in a night/day cycle. Pre-dried cl-SP beads (weight: 1.0 g) were placed on a Petri dish (diameter: 3.5 cm) and moved into an artificial climate chamber (∼25 °C and 90% RH). After 12 h, the wet cl-SP beads and Petri dish were moved into a condenser, which were illuminated for another 12 h under 1 sun. Water vapor was condensed through the hemispherical and transparent condenser. Water vapor turned into liquid droplets on the cold surface and was collected in a water container. The water production rate of cl-SP beads can be expressed using eqn (5),48 (5)where Rw (h−1) is the water production rate, m0 (g) is the weight of dried cl-SP beads. mcon (g) is the weight of condensed water at time t (h). Under 1 sun, a gradual increase in mcon was observed over time (Fig. S18, ESI†). 1 g of cl-SP beads produced 2.86 g of water and afforded a Rw of 0.238 h−1 in 12 h under 1 sun.
Alternating water vapor sorption–desorption cycles were performed to evaluate the performance stability of the cl-SP beads (Fig. 6f). In this method, water vapor sorption was conducted under 90% RH and at room temperature (∼25 °C) in the first 24 h. The subsequent water desorption was conducted in a warm oven (∼80 °C) for another 24 h. No evident decay on water uptake was recorded after 10 sorption–desorption cycles. The digital photographs, SEM and EDS images show that the cl-SP beads can retain the initial structures at both macroscopic and microscopic levels (Fig. S19, ESI†). Ca and Cl were still evenly distributed throughout their bulk structures after 10 sorption–desorption cycles (Fig. S20, ESI†). The results indicate the good performance and morphological stability of the cl-SP beads. Notably, the water sorption performance of cl-SP beads is among the best-performing hygroscopic hydrogels in a broad RH range of 40–90%, as summarized in Fig. 6g and Table S6, ESI.† The results highlight the efficient and reliable clean water production of cl-SP beads. The results also indicate the temperature-driven coil-to-globule transition of the PNIPAM component had a negligible effect on the Ca2+ crosslinked SA network and the DN hydrogel's morphology can be retained after sorption–desorption cycles.
2.3 Atmospheric water harvesting and release at outdoor conditions
Atmospheric water harvesting and solar-powered water release were performed outdoors throughout nighttime/daytime cycles (in late July, Qingdao, China). Atmospheric water harvesting was characterized at night when a Petri dish (diameter: 3.5 cm) containing 0.5 g of pre-dried cl-SP beads was placed on a rooftop (Fig. 7a). Small changes in the ambient temperature and RH were observed from 19:00 to 07:00 the next day, exhibiting average values of ∼27 °C and ∼95%, respectively (Fig. 7b). The pre-dried cl-SP beads gradually gained weight over time due to atmospheric water sorption. It reached 2.82 g g−1 of water uptake overnight (12 h), exhibiting a Rs of 0.235 h−1. The result highlights the efficient atmospheric water harvesting of cl-SP beads during nighttime.
 Fig. 7  (a) Schematic illustration and digital photographs of atmospheric water harvesting and solar-powered water release based on cl-SP beads at outdoor experiments; (b) atmospheric water harvesting during nighttime; (c) the sun's position on the sky dome; (d) solar-powered water release during daytime; (e) atmospheric water harvesting and water release in night–day cycles and (f) a long-term experiment of atmospheric water harvesting over 5 days. 
After water sorption at night, the wet cl-SP beads were warmed under the sun. Outdoor solar evaporation and dehydration was measured in the daytime (07:00–19:00). Azimuth and elevation angles were used to pinpoint the sun's position in the sky. The local solar elevation angle was 11.2° at 07:00, then rose to the maximum angle of 67.0° at 13:00 and fell to 11.0° at 19:00 (Fig. 7c). Time-dependent surface temperature and water content of cl-SP beads were monitored together with RH and solar intensity (Fig. 7d). On a sunny and breezy day, RH of air was gradually lowered from 90% at 7:00 to a minimum value of 32% at 13:00. RH then raised in the afternoon and returned to 90% at 19:00. The surface temperature of cl-SP beads showed a similar trend with the solar intensity. A maximum temperature of ∼45 °C was observed at 13:00 when the sun showed the highest intensity (92 mW cm−2) and elevation angle (69°). There was over 4 h (10:00–14:00) in the day when the ambient temperature was higher than LCST (34.9 °C) of the cl-SP beads. Associated with surface temperature and solar intensity, the water content of cl-SP beads gradually reduced from 2.82 g g−1 (at 7:00) to 0.50 g g−1 (at 16:00). ∼82% of absorbed water was released in 9 h and a Rd of 0.258 h−1 was recorded, indicating efficient water release under real sky. Notably, the cl-SP beads started to harvest atmospheric water when the sun fell and RH of air raised again (Fig. 7e). Their regenerated hydrophilic surface below LCST should play a role in this reversible moisture sorption of the cl-SP beads. As a result, a moisture sorption/desorption cycle can be achieved by cl-SP beads within 24 h. Two moisture sorption processes and one water release process were recorded in 36 h. In addition, a life cycle testing was conducted to evaluate the performance stability of cl-SP beads in night/day cycles. Steady water release was observed in 5 cycles, exhibiting an average water uptake of 2.96 g g−1 per day (Fig. 7f).
The quality of water is vital to irrigated agriculture. Salinity, sodicity and ion toxicity are major issues for irrigation water use. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) measurements showed that the concentrations of primary elements (Na, Mg, K, and Ca) of the purified water were far below the drinking-water quality standards published by World Health Organization (WHO), indicating clean water production of the cl-SP beads for irrigation (Fig. S21, ESI†). Furthermore, crops grown in different climatic zones show varied water needs. In general, a standard crop (reference crop) is employed to determine the water quantity of this crop required per day in different climatic regions. The average daily water needs of the reference grass crop are listed in Table S7, ESI,† which strongly depend on the climatic zone and daily temperature. For instance, the grass crop grown in a sub-humid climate at 20 °C needs 5.5 mm of irrigation water per day. The same grass crop grown in a semi-arid climate at 20 °C requires more irrigation water (6.5 mm) per day. Assuming 12 h of atmospheric water harvesting (19:00–7:00) at night and 12 h of sunlight (7:00–19:00) in the day, 2.26 kg of cl-SP beads can yield sufficient clean water and sustain 1 m2 of standard grass crops without liquid water supply for irrigation. The results highlight the potential of using cl-SP beads for clean water production in irrigated agriculture.
2.4 Solar-powered irrigation and plant cultivation
Apart from clean water production, an AWG-based and solar-powered seed propagator (or named smart nursery pot or device 1) was developed to evaluate solar-powered irrigation based on cl-SP beads. The prototype of the seed propagator is illustrated in Fig. 8a. Device 1 consisted of: (i) a plastic container with a transparent angled lid (45°); (ii) a rectangular tray placing cl-SP beads (16.0 g); (iii) a rectangular tray placing growing mediums and (iv) several drainage holes at the bottom of all plant trays. The seed propagator with an open lid was placed outdoor and the cl-SP beads captured the atmospheric moisture during the night (20:00–08:00). The transparent lid was closed and the solar-powered seed propagator was moved into a greenhouse during the day (08:00–18:00). Solar rays gradually warmed the cl-SP beads, triggered their phase transition and generated water vapor. The slant cover also served as the steam condenser and clean water can constantly flow into the nursery pot. It took the cl-SP beads 24 h to complete a moisture capture and release cycle. Seeds of three-leaf clover (a staple crop for silage in the temperature northern hemisphere) were sowed into the nursery pot. Once well-established, three-leaf clover is drought tolerant and can survive and grow despite lack of water, but frequent watering is necessary for its early growth phase. River sand was used as the growing medium, ruling out the influences of organic fertilizers on plant growth. The seeds were germinated and cultivated at constant light intensity (∼1000 W m−2), ambient temperature (∼25 °C), soil temperature (∼26 °C) and RH (∼45%) (Fig. S22, ESI†). Based on the same plant and growing conditions, another seed propagator (named device 2) without using cl-SP beads was characterized as a control group.
 Fig. 8  (a) Schematic illustration of the solar-powered seed propagator based on cl-SP beads; (b) water content measurements of growing mediums in 31 days; (c) germination rates of clover in 13 days; (d) digital photographs of plant height in device 1 over time; (e) summary of bud height in 31 days and (f) survival rates of clover in 31 days (inset images show different growth of clover in device 1 and device 2). 
In order to evaluate the clover growth controlled by water, the average water content of the sand in device 1 and device 2 was measured at 8 PM every day via a high-precise soil moisture meter. Proper watering was conducted on the first day, ensuring the sand in device 1 and device 2 had a similar water content of ∼11.8%. No watering was further performed in the next 30 days. As plotted in Fig. 8b, the sand in device 1 showed a steady water content of 10.5–13.5% over days. On the other hand, a gradual decline of water content from ∼12% to 0 was recorded in the sand of device 2. The result indicates that the cl-SP beads can retain acceptable water content in the growing mediums, which is vital in sustaining seed germination and growth. Germination of clover was found on the third day and gradually increased in both devices. Device 1 afforded a steady germination rate of over 85% in the 13 days (Fig. 8c). On the other hand, the germination rate in device 2 was reduced sharply after 7 days, since the worsening water availability significantly limited the clover germination. Time-lapse photographs of clover growth in device 1 and device 2 were taken (Fig. S23, ESI†) and the length of bud and root were measured over days (Fig. 8d). With adequate water supply in device 1, a gradual increase in the length of stems and roots (primary growth) was observed over time (Fig. 8e and S24, ESI†). The clover showed small branches and grew to ∼12.0 cm long on day 12. The clover then continued to grow to adult plants, exhibiting a steady length of ∼18.8 cm on day 31. On the other hand, the clover in device 2 showed a maximum length of ∼6.8 cm, which wilted over days due to the lack of watering. Furthermore, survival ratios of clover were measured in the two devices. Nearly all clover in device 1 survived 31 days without water, exhibiting a high and steady survival ratio approaching to 99% (Fig. 8f). On the other hand, the survival ratio of clover showed a sharp decline in device 2 and no clover can survival after 12 days. Furthermore, the degradation of cl-SP beads in natural environment was measured to assess their potential for long-term use. The cl-SP beads showed no structural deformation and negligible decline in mass after being buried in the soil for 31 days (Fig. S25, ESI†). The result reveals their good material stability against biofouling and biodegradation. The plant cultivation results highlight the practicability of the plant propagator based on synergistic atmospheric water harvesting and solar-powered irrigation.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a sorbent-based and solar-powered seed propagator was developed based on hygroscopic, photothermal and bead-like hydrogels and demonstrated for efficient solar irrigation in agricultural applications. The unique merits of our system-level design are rationalized as follows (i)–(iv): (i) selected material components: marine-biomass-derived SA, thermo-responsive PNIPAM, hygroscopic CaCl2 and photothermal dye were properly incorporated into a monolithic composite, resulting in hygroscopic, photothermal and temperature-responsive cl-SP beads. (ii) Shape-controlled and mass fabrication: in situ polymerization of NIPAM monomers and Ca2+ cross-linked SA networks delivered rapid gelation, proper mechanical strength and continuous manufacturing of cl-SP beads. (iii) Reversible moisture sorption and multi-modal water release: cl-SP beads can afford efficient water vapor sorption in a broad RH range of 40–90%, achieving a maximum water uptake of over 5.0 g g−1 under 90% RH. As compared to neat ALG-Ca beads, the temperature-driven hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic transition at a low LCST (34.9 °C) can enhance the water release from the cl-SP beads in both quantity and rate under a wide range of solar intensity (0.6–1 sun) and temperature (23–60 °C). (iv) Efficient plant cultivation: taking the benefits of the reliable moisture sorption–desorption, the seed propagator based on the cl-SP beads can regularly irrigate plants without liquid water input, improving germination, growth and survival rates of plants compared to common growing mediums. This work shines light on the shape-controlled and mass fabrication of composite hydrogels for efficient and reversible water vapor harvesting. This work also provides the future perspectives of sorbent-based AWGs in energy-wise and sustainable agriculture, particularly facing the irrigation demand of off-grid communities in urban, landlocked and water-stressed areas.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Material preparation

4.1.1 Synthesis of ALG-Ca beads. 
SA (2.3%) and black dye (6%) were mixed in an aqueous solution and were warmed to 50 °C. The mixture was added dropwise into the warm aqueous solution (∼50 °C) of CaCl2 (0.74 g mL−1) via a peristaltic pump. The gel gelation occurred in 30 min and bead-like hydrogels were formed. The beads were placed in the CaCl2 solution and were slowly cooled to room temperature. The beads were washed with ethanol and deionized water, and were dehydrated in a drying oven at 80 °C. Dry ALG-Ca beads were obtained after 48 h.


4.1.2 Synthesis of PNIPAM. 
NIPAM (400 mg, 3.53 mmol) and N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (80 mg, 0.52 mmol) were dissolved in deionized water (5 mL). The solution was heated to 50 °C. After that, potassium persulfate (KPS) (50 mg, 0.18 mmol) was added to the solution. The polymerization was carried out at 50 °C for 30 min and slowly cooled to room temperature. The hydrogel was washed with ethanol and deionized water, dehydrated in a drying oven at 80 °C. Dry PNIPAM solids were obtained after 48 h.


4.1.3 Synthesis of cl-SP beads. 
NIPAM, MBA (0.2% relative to NIPAM), K2(SO4)2 (0.125% relative to NIPAM) and black dye (6%) were dissolved in a warm SA solution (2.3% in water, ∼50 °C) to prepare fluid-like cl-SP gels with different ratios of SA and NIPAM. The mixed gels were added dropwise into the warm aqueous solution (∼50 °C) of CaCl2 (0.74 g mL−1) via a peristaltic pump. The gel gelation occurred in 30 min and different batches of cl-SP beads were formed. The beads were placed in the CaCl2 solution and were slowly cooled to room temperature. The beads were washed with ethanol and deionized water, and were dehydrated in a drying oven at 80 °C. Dry cl-SP beads were obtained after 48 h.

4.2 Moisture sorption and desorption

4.2.1 Indoor measurements. 
Water vapor sorption of all samples was evaluated in an artificial climate chamber (RGC-160D, Youke) at room temperature (∼25 °C) and controlled RH (40–90%). The weights of samples were measured over time. Water uptake and release were calculated based on the mass changes and initial weights. Solar evaporation experiments were conducted at ∼25 °C and 30% RH using a xenon lamp (CEL-S500, CEAULIGHT) with an AM 1.5G optical filter. Mass changes of water were real-time recorded through an electronic balance (QUINTIX224-1CN, Sartorius; accuracy: 0.1 mg). Temperature distribution of all samples was monitored by an IR camera (223s-L19, Fotric Precision Instruments).


4.2.2 Outdoor measurements. 
During the night, cl-SP beads were placed on a window sill for atmospheric water harvesting. During the day, water-saturated cl-SP beads were warmed under real sky for solar evaporation. Mass changes of cl-SP beads were real-time recorded via a high-precision electronic balance (QUINTIX224-1CN, Sartorius; accuracy: 0.1 mg). Temperature and RH were monitored via an automatic temperature and humidity meter (Smart sensor AS817). Solar flux was measured via a thermopile connected to a power meter (CEL-NP2000, CEAULIGHT).
