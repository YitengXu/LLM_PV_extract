    , Accepted 13th May 2013First published on 14th May 2013AbstractThe potential application of the single-layer MoS2 as a photocatalyst was revealed based on first-principles calculations. It is found that the pristine single-layer MoS2 is a good candidate for hydrogen production, and its catalysing ability can be tuned by the applied mechanical strain. Furthermore, the p-type doping could make the single layer a good photocatalyst for the overall water splitting.
Introduction
The single-layer MoS2 is an insulator with a direct bandgap of about 1.75–1.9 eV at the K point in the Brillouin zone.1–8 After the exfoliation from bulk,1 the two-dimensional (2D) structure of MoS2 has been a subject of extensive studies.7,9–11 Recently, it was revealed to exhibit exotic electronic properties that have illuminated many promising applications in valley electronics,7,9–11 transistor fabrication,12 optoelectronic devices13 and high-end flexible electronics.14 Besides that, as mentioned by many researchers, it may also have important applications in photovoltaic applications in light of its tuneable band structures.1,3,5,6,12,14
The bulk MoS2 itself is not a good candidate for application as a photocatalyst. However, the nanoscale MoS2, like a nanoribbon and a cluster, exhibits unusual physical and chemical properties due to quantum confinement,13,15–18 and possesses photo-induced catalyzing abilities.13,19,20 Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of the photocatalytic properties of the single-layer structure of MoS2 is timely and relevant for the field of solar fuel production. Furthermore, the single-layer MoS2 possesses excellent charge carrier mobility, as good as that of a carbon nanotube,21 and a superior surface-to-volume ratio that could be an advantage for a photoelectrocatalyst. Therefore, we have explored in this work the potential of the single-layer MoS2 as a photocatalyst by means of calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT).
It is well known that the application of mechanical strain is a powerful and practical method to tune the electronic structures of materials.5,6 Actually, the mechanical strain may exist when the single layer is prepared. For example, there are measurements on graphene exfoliated over a substrate prepatterned with shallow depressions, which demonstrate that graphene does not remain free-standing but instead adheres to the substrate with induced biaxial strain.22 The mechanical strain is also possible to be introduced in the single-layer MoS2 due to adhesion and lattice mismatching during the preparation by CVD etc. To probe the effects of strain on the photocatalytic properties of the single-layer MoS2, we have calculated its band structure and band edge energy levels with respect to the variant strain along the zigzag direction, the armchair direction as well as the z-axis direction. Although Tianshu Li5 and Emilio Scalise et al.6 have calculated the strain effects separately on the band structure along zigzag and armchair directions and given exciting results, we still believe that it is necessary to perform a comprehensive study of the strain effects both along in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Especially, the pz orbital often plays an important role in 2D materials,23,24 and the single-layer MoS2 actually contains three atomic layers with the Mo layer sandwiched between two S layers. So, the lattice change along the z-direction is therefore also very important. Besides, the introduction of strain in the out-of-plane direction1,14,25 is possible and it is as easy as that in the in-plane direction.26,27
On the other hand, intrinsic and extrinsic doping on semiconductors are common strategies for the modification of electronic structures. The doping process is widely used in the semiconductor industry, which has made great success in Si processes, transistors, solar cells as well as photocatalysis. Doping with variant concentrations of dopants provides a powerful technique for people to manipulate the electronic structures of materials. The doping of semiconductors can not only modulate the bandgap and the energy level, but also cause modification to the compositions of band edges. The donors or acceptors will induce charge redistribution to the doped system, so as to yield sites with totally different potentials, and thus affect the photocatalytic reaction. It is reasonable to expect that the photocatalytic activity can be tuned and improved by utilizing appropriate doping. Thus, we have explored the p-type doping effects on the single-layer MoS2 in search for the improvement of its catalysing ability.
Computational methods
Our calculations were based on the first-principles density functional theory using a projector augmented wave (PAW) method,28,29 which is implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).30–32 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) proposed by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof33 was used for the exchange and correlation functional. In addition, the hybridized (HSE06)34,35 functional was also used for comparison to reveal the nature of the band of the single-layer MoS2. A plane wave cut-off energy of 450 eV was found to be enough to reach convergence and was used in all calculations. The primitive cell of single-layer MoS2 containing one Mo atom and two S atoms was used under periodic boundary conditions. A vacuum space of 16 Å adopted along the z-axis was proved to be able to decouple possible periodic interactions. The valence electrons 3s3p for S, 4p5s4d for Mo and 3s3p for P were included in the PAW pseudopotentials. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a Gamma centred 13 × 13 × 1 k-point mesh using the Gaussian smearing method in structure relaxations, while a finer grid of 25 × 25 × 1 k-points was employed to conduct single-point calculations. The density of the k-mesh was also tested to reach energy convergence.
In the context of photocatalytic reactions, the crucial step is the electron transfer between the photocatalyst and water redox species. Electrons can only be transferred between the states in the photocatalyst and the water redox species if thermodynamics laws are obeyed as we will explain more specifically below. The standard water redox potentials are usually referred to with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), which is frequently used in geochemical and electrochemical studies. Redox potentials contain the oxidation potential and the reduction potential. The oxidation potential and the reduction potential at 25 °C are about −5.67 eV and −4.44 eV, respectively, with respect to the absolute vacuum level,36 and the latter is usually taken as a zero-potential by convention.
While the relevant energy levels for a photocatalyst are the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM). The relative energetics of VBM and CBM vs. redox potentials is the important property of a photocatalyst, which determines the feasibility of water splitting. Moreover, for the overall water splitting reaction to be allowed from the thermodynamics viewpoint, the CBM should be located at a more negative potential than the proton reduction potential (H+/H2), while the VBM must be positioned more positively than the oxygen reduction potential (O2/H2O). To compare redox potentials of water with the band edge potentials of the photocatalyst, these potentials should be related to a common reference, for which we have used the absolute vacuum level. Here we have used a standard approach to refer the band edges to the vacuum level where the top of the valence band is assumed to be numerically equal to the work function of the materials. The latter is then calculated from the equation:37 φ = V(∞) − EF(1)where V(∞) is the electrostatic potential in a vacuum region, of a slab geometry calculation (single-layer), far from the neutral surface and EF is the Fermi level of the neutral surface system. The reliability of this method has been verified by the weak temperature and pressure dependence of band edge potentials in the range of interest. Hence, in this way, we have succeeded in comparing the calculated band edge levels with experimental redox potentials in the same scale.
In view of the solar energy conversion efficiency, the high absorption rate of visible light is essential for photocatalysis. The optical properties of materials can be completely described by the complex dielectric function: ε(ω) = ε1(ω) + iε2(ω). Here, the dielectric function was calculated in the momentum representation, by acquiring the matrix elements between occupied and unoccupied eigen states. The imaginary part of the dielectric function due to direct interband transition can be derived from the Fermi golden rule:38 (2)where the indices c and v refer to conduction and valence band states, respectively, and μck is the cell periodic part of the wavefunctions at the given k-point. The dipole transition matrix element was calculated from the self-consistent band structure using the PAW29,30 method.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the structure of the single-layer MoS2, and the visualization of the electron localization function (ELF)39 that allows us to qualitatively analyze the nature of the chemical bonding. The relaxed lattice constant obtained using the GGA method (a = 3.178 Å) is very close to the experimental finding40,41 and the theoretical value reported by other authors.4–6 The S–Mo–S angle is 80.9 degree, which agrees well with the value of 81.1 degree reported by Tianshu Li5 and is close to that of 80.69 degree reported by C. Ataca and Ciraci.42 The grade of the ELF is encoded using a colour scheme in which high values correspond to red and low values to blue. The site of the Mo cation is characterized by low values of ELF; whereas S sites display large red annular regions. Such large difference in the ELF is a signature of an ionic kind of chemical bonding. However, a degree of covalence is also present, because the region of high ELF around S anions is not spherically symmetric and exhibits lobes directed toward the Mo ion. Besides that, there are also lobes between the adjacent S cations either in the same layer or in two layers. Thus, the bonding between Mo and S is a mixture of ionic and covalent bonds, and there are also slight covalent characteristic bonds between the adjacent S anions.

The electronic structure of single-layer MoS2 was intensively investigated recently both experimentally and theoretically.1,2,4–8,12,14,41–44 Andrea Splendiani et al. investigated the electronic and optical properties of the single-layer MoS2 structure through optical reflection, Raman scattering, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. A direct bandgap of about 1.75 eV was obtained from their measurements.2 Kin Fai Mak et al. also revealed a direct bandgap of 1.90 eV by using the combination of three complementary techniques, with samples prepared both on solid surfaces and as freestanding films.1 The theoretical bandgaps calculated through density functional theory also slightly differ depending upon the employed exchange–correlation functional. As can be seen from Table 1, Tianshu Li5 using PBE functional and Trouiller–Martins type norm-conserving pseudopotentials obtained a bandgap of about 1.78 eV for single-layer MoS2. Emilio Scalise et al.6 reported a value of 1.72 eV using the GGA method. C. Ataca and Ciraci3,42 calculated a direct bandgap of 1.63 eV using the GGA functional plus van der Waals corrections (vdW),45 and 1.87 eV using the LDA method. Cheiwchanchamnangij and Lambrecht46 employed the quasiparticle self-consistent GW method and obtained a direct bandgap of 2.76 eV.

The experimental researchers have been very careful in obtaining the freestanding single-layer MoS2, because the electronic structure is sensitive to strain and contact. The dispersion of the bandgap in the range of 1.75–1.90 eV in experiments may come from the different preparation and characterization methods, but it also suggests the sensitivity of the electronic structure to different environments. The theoretical direct bandgaps disperse from 1.63 eV to 2.76 eV for relaxed structures, depending on the exchange and correlation functionals. There is also discrepancy within the same methods as can be seen in Table 1. It can be speculated that the electronic structure of the single-layer MoS2 is sensitive to the atomic structure, which is also clarified in the works of Tianshu Li5 and Emilio Scalise et al.6 separately. The linear strain coefficient is as much as −112.2 ± 4.2 meV/% under uniaxial tension,5 and the single-layer MoS2 can even become metallic under applied strain.
The calculated direct bandgap is found to be 1.70 eV with a relaxed Mo–S bond length of 2.41 Å in our work, while the direct bandgap obtained using the HSE06 method is 2.10 eV with a relaxed Mo–S bond length of 2.39 Å. It is well known that the GGA usually provides structural accuracy, but underestimates the bandgap by about 30%,47 while the screened Coulomb potential HSE06 can describe the bandgap more accurately. However, in the case of MoS2, it seems that the GW method and the HSE06 method as well as the GGA + vdW method failed to reproduce the experimental bandgap, while the GGA and LDA acquired better performances. It is noted that the dimension of the single-layer MoS2 is one less than that of the bulk. In low-dimensional systems, not only the surface-state wave function is qualitatively different from that of the bulk, but also the screening at the surface is very different. We have used the GGA theory level for the following calculations since the GGA presents enough accuracy of structure and energetics in comparison to experiments. Fig. 2 shows the band structures calculated using GGA. The VBM is lower at the Γ point than at the K point and there is a direct bandgap at K. The composition of the wave function for the highest occupied crystalline orbital (HOCO) is almost dominated by the Mo-4d state, and is rarely from the S-3p state, as can be seen in Fig. 2. While the wave function of the lowest unoccupied crystalline orbital (LUCO) is also controlled by Mo-4d and marginally by the S-3p state.

From the bandgap calculations, it can be seen that the single-layer MoS2 seems to be active for visible light absorption, which can be confirmed from the light adsorption spectrum. The imaginary part of the complex dielectric function measures the light absorption ability of materials. Fig. 3 shows the imaginary part of the complex dielectric function of the single-layer MoS2 compared with that of bulk MoS2.48 The characteristic peaks of the result obtained using GGA are very similar to those of bulk, but with a shift of about 50 nm towards the short wavelength end. While the result obtained using HSE06 shifts too much towards the short wavelength end and has less similarity with the experimental data of the bulk. The shifting is a result of the bandgap widening when the single layer is exfoliated from bulk. Since the peaks of the single layer mostly lie in the visible light range (350–700 nm), the single-layer MoS2 would display high absorption of the sunlight, which is ideal for applications in sunlight-driven photocatalysis. However, it has a relatively low adsorption rate at the long wavelength end. Such a phenomenon originates from the electronic structure of the single-layer MoS2. As mentioned above, the component of the wave function for the HOCO almost completely originated from the Mo-4d state, and the LUCO is also governed by the Mo-4d state. Whereas, the excitation from the occupied Mo-4d orbital to the unoccupied Mo-4d orbital is symmetrically forbidden. Only the transition from S-3p to Mo-4d or from Mo-4d to S-3p is allowed. Consequently, the adsorption has a relatively low start from the long wavelength end. The main peak that lies at about 450 nm is speculated to be attributed to the transition from the occupied Mo-4d orbital to the unoccupied S-3p orbital. From the complex dielectric function of the single-layer MoS2, it can be concluded that this material is suitable for energy harvesting applications as it displays high adsorption in the visible light range.

The mechanical strain was applied along the zigzag, armchair and z-axis direction, ranging from −10% to 10%, to probe the effects on the electronic structure. The single-layer MoS2 is soft and stretchable, and a strain of up to 10% can be achieved without reaching the limits in practice.5 The evolution of a bandgap with respect to the applied strain is shown in Fig. 4. The evolution trends of a bandgap under tensile strain along the armchair direction and the zigzag direction are consistent with the findings of Tianshu Li5 and Emilio Scalise et al.6 The bandgap decreases continuously with the increasing strain, and the speed is much faster along the armchair direction. It is consistent with the finding of Tianshu Li5 that the strength along the armchair direction is much weaker. The single-layer MoS2 becomes metallic when the strain is large enough, as founded by Emilio Scalise et al.6 and Tianshu Li.5 Surprisingly, the compressive in-plane strain induced an unusual increase in the bandgap, which is followed by a continuous decrease. Such a phenomenon is rarely observed in the regular variations of the bandgap under strain, as measured in Si23 and other semiconductors. Furthermore, the evolution trend of the bandgap under strain along the z-axis is reverse when compared with that along zigzag and armchair directions. The bandgap increases firstly and then decreases with increasing tensile strain, while it decreases steadily under compressive strain.
 Fig. 4  The evolution of the bandgap of single-layer MoS2 under applied mechanical strain. 
As we have mentioned above, to reveal the potential application of the single-layer MoS2 as a photocatalyst, it is necessary to align the materials' band edge potentials with respect to the water redox potentials. Since the bandgap of single-layer MoS2 is significantly influenced by mechanical strain, it is important to check the changes in band edge potentials under strain. We have found that not only the bandgap changes significantly under strain but also the energy levels of CBM and VBM (see Fig. 5). First of all, it should be noted that the single-layer MoS2 is a suitable candidate as a photocatalyst. The CBM is located at a more negative potential than the proton reduction potential (H+/H2), while the VBM is positioned more positively than the oxygen reduction potential (O2/H2O). A bandgap of about 1.7 eV is ideal for a visible light active photocatalyst as well as the effective utilization of the solar energy. In a much closer examination, the oxidizing power (denoted as Δ2), which is defined as the difference between the VBM band edge and the oxygen reduction potential, is found to be only 0.07 V. However, the reducing power (denoted as Δ1), which is defined as the difference between the proton reduction and the CBM edge potentials, is found to be 0.41 V. The small oxidizing power diminishes and even becomes negative whenever strain is applied in any direction, thus losing the oxidization ability. While the reducing power increases when small in-plane compressive strain or out-of plane tensile strain is applied, which improves the reduction ability of the single-layer MoS2. As the main purpose of the photocatalytic reaction is to obtain hydrogen gas, it can be speculated that the appropriate mechanical strain can improve the hydrogen production. However, the imbalance between the reduction reaction and oxidation reaction will prevent the further process of redox reactions. It can only be continued when excessive oxidization species are reduced, which requires the introduction of a co-catalyst or an electrode.
 Fig. 5  The evolution of the VBM and CBM under applied strain: (a) zigzag direction, (b) armchair direction, (c) z-axis direction. 
To enable the single-layer MoS2 as a photocatalyst for the overall water splitting reaction (we refer to the photocatalyst that can balance the reduction reaction and oxidation reaction, so there will not be excessive reduction species or oxidization species and the water splitting can proceed continuously), the reduction reaction and the oxidization reaction should proceed simultaneously in a relatively synchronized pace. In another word, the reduction power and oxidation power should be balanced. In this context, the single-layer MoS2 is a good candidate for reduction but not for oxidation. The large difference between Δ1 and Δ2 imbalances the reduction and oxidation reactions, which in turn inhibits the progress of the overall redox reaction. Reducing the difference between Δ1 and Δ2 may allow the single-layer MoS2 to be a good photocatalyst for the overall water splitting with improved efficiency.
If the oxidation power can be promoted, even at a little expense of reduction power, the efficiency of the overall photocatalytic reaction may be improved. The controlled bandgap engineering is necessary in order to enhance the catalysing efficiency of photocatalysis, and the extrinsic doping of a foreign element into a semiconductor is a promising strategy for modification of the band structure. The sensitive dependence of the semiconductor electronic and optical properties on dopants has provided a powerful approach to explore and make use of this material. Besides, the doping process usually improves the electrical conductivity of semiconductors,9 which is beneficial for the reduction of recombination of electrons and holes in the photocatalysis. Our expectation is to shift downward the VBM level of the single-layer MoS2 while slightly lowering or stabilizing the CBM. “Broken bonds” (holes) need to be created in the lattice, which are free to move, which is p-type doping. Our idea is to dope the Group V element, phosphorus, which is commonly used as a dopant for semiconductors. Phosphorus has one electron less than sulphur, so it is expected that the bond between the dopant and Mo would be likely weaker than the bond between Mo and S. Thus the holes can be introduced successfully in the band structure forming a p-type compound.
Thus, we have replaced one S atom with a P atom in a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell with 32 S atoms and 16 Mo atoms, which corresponds to a low P concentration of 1.21 wt%. The structure was fully relaxed, and the band structure as well as the band edge potentials with respect to the redox levels are shown in Fig. 6. The formation energy of this substitutional doping is found to be 0.63 eV, which is calculated using: ΔEform = ET(D) − ET(I) + nμx − nμy(3)where ET(D) and ET(I) refer to the total energy of the doped system and the ideal pure system, respectively. While n is the number of doping atoms and μx and μy are the chemical potentials of the host and dopant atoms. After doping, the lowest peak of the 3s orbital of sulphur was shifted downwards only by 0.04 eV. In this work, the alignment of the doped single-layer MoS2 was done in reference to the lowest peak of the 3s orbital of the pristine single-layer MoS2. The results in Fig. 6 show successful p-type doping. The bandgap was slightly reduced to 1.63 eV. Δ1 was decreased to 0.20 V, and Δ2 was increased to 0.19 V, so that they became very close. The equalization of the reduction power and oxidation power can minimize the difference between the reduction and oxidation reactions, and further improve the catalyzing ability.

It can be seen in Fig. 7 that the pz orbital of P and the dz2 orbital of Mo strongly hybridize just below the Fermi level. Compared with the S atom, the P atom needs one more electron from Mo to fill its p orbitals. So, one empty orbital was created in the d bands of Mo, which corresponds to the state of CBM in the doped system. While the P atom accepted the “excess” electron from the Mo atom, which corresponds to state of the VBM. Therefore, the energy level of VBM in MoS2 was lowered by a hole generated from the Mo atom following the P doping. After doping, the contribution of the S-3p state to HOCO is still negligible, but the HOCO has a large contribution from P-3p orbitals. While the LUCO is still governed by Mo-4d orbitals as can be seen from the band structure in Fig. 6 and PDOS in Fig. 7. Now, the transition directly from the HOCO to LUCO will be enhanced, since the excitation of electron from the P-3p orbital to the Mo-4d orbital is allowed by parity after doping. Therefore, the light absorption efficiency of the single-layer MoS2 will be strengthened in the long wavelength end. What is more, the reduction and oxidation of water will proceed in the Mo sites and S sites separately after p-type doping. As can be seen in Fig. 6(a) and (b), the wave function of HOCO (red isosurface) mostly lies around P atoms and adjacent Mo atoms, while the wave function of LUCO (blue isosurface) gathers around the Mo atoms that are far away from P atoms. Such charge density distribution can not only separate the reduction and oxidation sites during water splitting, but also depress the recombination of electrons and holes. So the catalysing efficiency would be greatly improved by p-type doping.

Conclusions
In summary, the potential application of the single-layer MoS2 as a photocatalyst was revealed in this work. The pristine single-layer MoS2 can be a good photocatalyst but needs the introduction of a co-catalyst or an electrode. The applied small in-plane compressive strain or out-of-plane tensile strain can improve its hydrogen production ability. While the p-type doping can significantly improve the catalyzing ability by strengthening the direct electron transition from HOCO to LUCO and by separating the reduction and oxidations sites. Furthermore, the difference between the reduction power and oxidation power can be minimized by equalizing Δ1 and Δ2 through p-type doping, which improves the overall photocatalytic redox reaction. The light absorption was also enhanced in the long wavelength end of visible light with p-type doping. This facilitates the single-layer MoS2 as an efficient visible-light photocatalyst for the overall water splitting.
