    AbstractBis-ortho-diynyl-arene C60 adducts (BODA-co-C60), a novel pre-network polymer of aromatic enediynes possessing a fullerene core that is prepared by the Bergman cyclopolymerization of bis-ortho-diynyl-arene monomer with C60, have been organized uniformly onto a nanostructured SnO2 electrode by utilizing the simple drop cast method to maximize the intrinsic high solubility of BODA-co-C60, over 2 mg/100 μL in chloroform. The resulting robust and homogeneous film exhibits a continuous smooth absorption with no shoulder, which agrees well with that of a chloroform solution containing BODA-co-C60, suggesting that no aggregation occurs during the solvent evaporation process. White light was irradiated to a BODA-co-C60 thin film employed as the working electrode to generate a relatively high anodic photocurrent in the presence of the I−/I3− redox couple. This is characteristic for the photogalvanic type of photocurrent generation and indicates the successful electron injection from the C60 anions to the SnO2 nanocrystallites, following the photoinduced charge separation. The result with regard to a photocurrent action spectrum allows us to conclude that polyarylene networks covering a C60 core act as solubilizer and are not responsible for the photocurrent generation under white light illumination. Thus, this strategy for fullerene solubilization using polyarylene units is critical to a uniform organizing of C60 onto nanocrystalline SnO2 as a building block, leading to the construction of an efficient light-to-energy conversion system in combination with the light harvester.
Introduction
Among the wide range of three-dimensional π-electron acceptors prepared to date, buckminsterfullerenes (C60) stand out because of (1) their small reorganization energy associated with electron transfer, which results from the large π-electron system being delocalized over the three dimensional surface together with the rigid and confined structure of the aromatic π-system, (2) their unique photochemical, (3) photophysical, and (4) electrochemical properties.1–4 The appropriate combination of C60 or C60 functionalized derivatives with electron donors (e.g., porphyrinoids) leads to an acceleration of photoinduced charge separation together with the deceleration of charge recombination processes, enabling us to afford the unprecedented long lifetime of the charge-separated states with high quantum yields, as in the case of the primary function of the photosynthetic reaction centers.5–7 This has further prompted the design of organic solar cells for artificial photosynthetic devices enabling light-to-energy conversion.8–10 The development of such devices can be guided by the key steps of natural photosynthesis, i.e., the efficient capture of visible light photons, electron/hole separation, and directional transport of the subsequent carriers. The effective carrier transport to the electrodes would be accompanied by an inhibition of back electron transfer following photoinduced charge separation and breakthrough with respect to the construction of an efficient light-to-energy conversion system. In such a case, the configuration of the C60 adsorption onto the electrode surface is a critical factor to control the carrier transport as well as the subsequent combination with the light harvesters. So far, extensive efforts devoted to develop a photoelectrochemical cell comprising of C60 or C60 derivative-adsorbed working electrodes, which are capable of efficient electron transfer and transport, have often been hampered.11 One reason why it is difficult to integrate single C60 molecules with electrodes at a high concentration arises from the inherently small solubility of fullerenes, which poses problems for fundamental research and further applications.
We report herein our discovery that BODA-co-C60, having a high solubility in a wide range of organic solvents, was uniformly organized onto the OTE/SnO2 electrode without aggregation to afford a relatively high photocurrent generation for C60-immobilized systems (Scheme 1).11 In addition to the preparation of definitely transparent OTE/SnO2 electrodes, the adsorption method of BODA-co-C60 on the electrodes has also been optimized. This study provides an excellent way to combine C60 functionalized derivatives with electron donors for further development of organic solar cells as artificial photosynthetic devices.

Experimental
Materials
All solvents and chemicals were of reagent grade quality and used without further purification. Conducting glass plates (1 × 5 cm) were obtained from Pilkington and used as optically transparent electrodes (OTE). BODA-co-C60 used in this study as electron transporter (C60), combined with diynyl arenes as the solubilizing component, has been prepared by Bergman cyclization and the detailed characterization has been reported elsewhere.12 The nanostructured SnO2 electrodes needed for the photoelectrochemical experiments were prepared as follows: 2 mL of an aqueous colloidal suspension of SnO2 (15%, Alfa Aesar) were evaporated slowly to half-volume and mixed with 2 mL of ammonium hydroxide, followed by the addition of the polyethyleneglycol (0.5 g) to obtain a relatively high-viscous, colloidal suspension. The SnO2 colloid was pasted onto the OTE by using a conventional doctor blade technique. After spin-coating, heating at 400 °C for 1.5 h and cooling down to room temperature, a definitely transparent OTE/SnO2 electrode was obtained. This can be recognized by recording a UV-VIS absorption spectrum (see below).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
These were carried out in a standard two-compartment cell consisting of a working electrode and a Pt wire gauze counter electrode. The I–V characteristics were performed using a three component cell consisting of an OTE working electrode, an SCE reference electrode, and a Pt wire gauze counter electrode in the presence of 0.5 M NaI in CH3CN. These experiments were recorded using a Princeton Applied Research (PAR) model PARSTAT 2263. All other photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using a working electrode and a Pt gauge counter electrode in the same cell assembly using a Keithley model 617 programmable electrometer. A collimated light beam from a 150 W Xenon lamp with a 380 nm cut-off filter was used for the excitation of the BODA-co-C60 thin films organized on the SnO2 electrodes. A Bausch and Lomb high intensity grating monochromator was introduced into the path of the excitation beam for the selected wavelength.
Results and discussion
Optimization of film preparation
C60 functionalized with diynyl arenes is soluble in a variety of organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, 1-propanol, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, acetone and acetonitrile, caused by the multi-functionalization on the fullerene surface, and thus, there is no correlation with solvent viscosity or dielectric constant.13 The immobilization of BODA-co-C60 onto nanostructured SnO2 has been optimized by utilizing the electrophoretic deposition method with an electric dc field following clusterization/aggregation in addition to the drop cast method that allows for organization to occur as the solvent evaporates slowly. The cluster formation of BODA-co-C60 occurs in chloroform/octane (1/3, v/v) which represents just one possible combination of a polar (chloroform, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, 1-propanol, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, acetone or acetonitrile) and an unpolar (octane, cyclohexane or methanol) solvent. A chloroform solution containing BODA-co-C60 (0.5 mg mL−1, 300 μL) was injected into 600 μL of octane to produce the cluster suspension. The suspension was transferred to a 1 cm cuvette in which the OTE and OTE/SnO2 electrodes were kept at a distance of 6 mm by using a Teflon spacer, while a dc voltage was applied using a Fluke 415A high voltage dc power supply (200 V, 3 min) to form the homogeneous BODA-co-C60-deposited SnO2 electrode as shown in Fig. 1a. However, only partial deposition of the cluster occurred, irrespective of the reaction time. Also, by applying such a high electric field, less reproducibility was obtained, both in the presence or absence of an inert atmosphere. This urged us to examine another immobilization method (drop cast).

A chloroform solution containing BODA-co-C60 (2 mg/100 μL) was dropped onto the OTE/SnO2 electrode and allowed to stand for several minutes, so the solvent could evaporate. The resulting electrode was dipped into acetonitrile to remove the unimmobilized BODA-co-C60, followed by washing with acetone to obtain the apparently homogeneous SnO2 electrode (Fig. 1c). This is in contrast to the electrode made by drop casting a dilute BODA-co-C60 solution (2 mg/2 mL) onto an OTE without SnO2, resulting in an uneven and randomly spread layer of BODA-co-C60 (Fig. 1b). The SnO2 film possesses a high affinity towards molecular adsorption arising from the inherent porous nanostructure given by the colloidal suspension.14 The homogeneity of the BODA-co-C60-adsorbed OTE/SnO2 electrode (Fig. 1c) can also be recognized clearly by the UV-VIS absorption spectrum shown in Fig. 2A (b). The OTE/SnO2/BODA-co-C60 electrode exhibits a continuous smooth absorption with no shoulder, which is consistent with the UV-VIS absorption spectrum of a chloroform solution (inset in Fig. 2A). This feature is in contrast to the case of cluster/aggregation made by electrophoresis with characteristic bands near 350 to 700 nm (Fig. 2B), which is seen in C60 and C60 derivatives,11e,i suggesting that no aggregation occurs between the adsorbates. In addition, a broad absorption was observed in the case of OTE/BODA-co-C60 (Fig. 1b), particularly in the range of 300–600 nm (Fig. 2A (c)). This may originate from the formation of a disordered network arising from the bimolecular interaction between each element in BODA-co-C60.

Photocurrent generation at the BODA-co-C60-adsorbed electrode
To confirm that the optical transitions seen in Fig. 2 are responsible for the charge separation following the light illumination, photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using a standard cell consisting of a light-absorber-attached or a free-OTE working electrode and a Pt gauze counter electrode in the presence of a I3−/I− redox couple. Fig. 3a shows the photocurrent generation in the photoelectrochemical cell with the OTE/SnO2/BODA-co-C60 electrode (Fig. 1c) as the photoanode, indicating that the photogenerated electrons in BODA-co-C60 are efficiently injected to the nanostructured SnO2. The value was much higher than that of the electrophoretically deposited film comprising of BODA-co-C60 shown in Fig. 1a (ca. 15 μA, not shown) and a blank SnO2 electrode (ca. 10 μA) under similar conditions (Fig. 3b).
 Fig. 3  Photocurrent of (a) OTE/SnO2/BODA-co-C60, (b) OTE/SnO2, and (c) OTE/BODA-co-C60 electrodes under visible light illumination (λ > 380 nm) in the absence of any applied bias. Electrolyte: 0.5 M NaI and 0.01 M I2 in acetonitrile. Input power: 100 mW cm−2. 
In contrast, the OTE/BODA-co-C60 electrode (Fig. 1b) afforded <0.05 μA as shown in Fig. 3c. This phenomenon is consistent with that of the photogalvanic type of photocurrent generation: following the light irradiation, the excited C60 in the BODA-co-C60 reacts with I− to form the C60 radical anion, followed by a fast electron injection from the C60 radical anion into the SnO2 nanocrystallites and the subsequent drive to the counter electrode via the external circuit to regenerate the redox couple (Scheme 1).11 The anodic photocurrent decreases as time advances. The reason for the observed photocurrent decay during the illumination cycles may arise from one of the two following possibilities: (i) a back electron transfer from the injected electrons on the SnO2 nanocrystallites to I3− or (ii) a back electron transfer from the photogenerated C60 radical anion to I3−. The blank SnO2 electrode affords a steady photocurrent during illumination cycles as shown in Fig. 3b, and hence, the first possibility (i) is not likely to contribute. This prompts us to consider the second possibility (ii). The free energy change of the electron transfer (ΔG0ET) from the C60 radical anion (−0.2 V vs. NHE) to iodide ion (I3−/I− = 0.5 V vs. NHE) is evaluated to be −0.7 V. This is more exergonic than the free energy change of the electron transfer from the C60 radical anion into the SnO2 nanocrystallites, being −0.2 V (conduction band energy for SnO2, ECB = 0.0 V vs. NHE).11,15 Therefore, the electron transfers from the C60 radical anion either back to I− or, as desired, to the SnO2 nanocrystallites, are likely considered to be competition processes. The electrophoretically deposited film of BODA-co-C60 (Fig. 1a) exhibits a similar photoresponse (ca. 70 μA) in the absence of I3−. Also, the photocurrent decreases as time advances (Fig. 3), as is the case with the BODA-co-C60 film made by the drop cast method (Fig. 1c). The addition of I3− to the solution containing I− affords the steady photocurrent seen in the few cases of electrophoretically deposited organized clusters consisting of C60 or C60 derivatives,11e,g,i although a significant decrease in photocurrent was observed as ca. 15 μA. Thus, compared to the cluster formed by electrophoresis (Fig. 1a), the molecularly organized BODA-co-C60 film made by the drop cast method (Fig. 1c) provides a better contact between the C60 radical anion (generated by the reaction of excited C60 with I− during the on-off illumination cycles) and the locally concentrated I3− near the film surface.
In addition, the decreased photoresponse was completely recovered after dipping the working electrode into acetonitrile, suggesting that no degradation occurs during on-off illumination cycles. It should be noted that the efficient electron transfer from the C60 radical anion to the nanocrystalline SnO2 suggests that the fullerene moiety within BODA-co-C60 essentially maintains the outstanding ability of the intrinsic C60 molecule to accept electrons readily and transport them, regardless of the direct functionalization of BODA to C60. This is supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images indicating the intact structure of C60 in BODA-co-C60.12

Fig. 4 shows the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the OTE/SnO2/BODA-co-C60 electrode. The anodic photocurrent decreases by increasing the negative applied potentials, indicating that the nanocrystalline SnO2 accumulates electrons and photogenerated charges are not transported efficiently to OTE. In addition, the electrochemical reduction of BODA-co-C60 caused the dark current to increase at negative applied potentials.11 The potential at zero current is a measure of the flat band potential and reflects the maximum attainable open circuit voltage, and is evaluated to be −0.16 V vs. SCE. The efficient charge transport together with an increased charge separation at potentials greater than −0.1 V vs. SCE are responsible for enhanced photocurrent generation.

The photocurrent action spectrum of the BODA-co-C60 thin film on an OTE/SnO2 electrode (Fig. 1c) was recorded using a monochromatic excitation source and is shown in Fig. 5, along with the UV-VIS absorption spectra. The IPCE value (defined as the number of electrons collected per photon, incident photon–to–current conversion efficiency) exhibits a broad photoresponse ranging from 400 to 650 nm under visible light illumination (λ > 380 nm) and decreases with increasing wavelengths. The IPCE value was attained as 0.87% at 460 nm, regardless of the fact that the photocurrent generation efficiency normally decreases with the introduction of large substituents onto the C60 surface.11i The slight increase in absorbance at 650 nm for the electrode as compared to that of the chloroform solution is mainly attributable to the light scattering effect from the precipitation of BODA-co-C60 at the interface. The decrease in IPCE values at short wavelengths (around 400 nm) as compared to the spectral features of the absorption spectra suggests that the diynyl arene moiety only acts as a solubilizer and is not responsible for the photocurrent generation, because the region of the short wavelength shows a superposition of the absorption of BODA and C60.12

In conclusion, a covalently functionalized fullerene, comprising solubilizing diynyl arene components coupled to the fullerene unit, was employed as an electron transporter for photoelectrochemical cells. The homogeneous thin film, molecularly organized by BODA-co-C60 onto the nanostructured SnO2 electrode, exhibits a relatively high anodic photocurrent under white light illumination via a photogalvanic mechanism. Thus, the present organization approach of using the solubilizing diynyl arene components coupled to the fullerene unit is quite promising, making it possible to further improve the light energy conversion properties by combining electron donor chromophores.
