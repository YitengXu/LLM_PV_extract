    , Accepted 13th July 2018First published on 16th July 2018AbstractCurrent perovskite solar cells (PSCs) often use high-purity single-crystal metal oxides prepared by complex growth processes as electron transport layers (ETLs). In particular, TiO2, as an ETL, can deteriorate the stability of PSCs under illumination. Here, we report a passivation strategy using Er-doped TiO2 synthesized with a one-step hydrothermal method as an ETL. Notably, the oxygen-induced defects in TiO2 have decreased to an acceptable level for PSCs due to the introduction of Er3+ ions. More interestingly, we find that a phase junction can be formed in the mixed crystalline rutile/anatase phase of TiO2, and this TiO2 phase junction can achieve efficient charge separation and accelerate internal electron transfer of the ETL. Taking advantage of these facts, we obtain TiO2-based PSCs through a two-step sequential deposition method in ambient air, whose best efficiency increases by 45.8%. Moreover, the Er-doped device exhibits remarkable ultraviolet resistance ability, whose efficiency is maintained over 90% even after 500 hour ultraviolet irradiation. We believe that this demonstrated strategy provides an effective way for preparing efficient and ultraviolet resistant PSCs in air.
Introduction
The organic–inorganic halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3) as a promising candidate in the photovoltaic field has attracted global attention due to its low-cost and facile solution process since the first report in 2009.1–3 The electron transport layers (ETLs) should be both in possession of efficient electron transporting property and appropriate energy level and are always playing a crucial role in perovskite solar cells (PSCs).4,5 As a kind of classical inorganic semiconductor ETL, TiO2 has been introduced in PSCs as a mesoporous layer to extract photo-generated electrons in the perovskite layer and then transfer these electrons to the electrode in consideration of a large band gap, high electron mobility and appropriate valence band position.6,7 Although recent reports indicated that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs based on the TiO2 ETL had reached up to 22.1%, the interface defects of TiO2/perovskite still inevitably result in local recombination centers and trapped photo-generated electrons,8,9 which also led to notorious stability problems of perovskite films.10 It is increasingly apparent that the device stability of PSCs is too inferior to satisfy the needs of practical applications. Previous results have shown that humidity and UV radiation are two main influencing factors on the perovskite film decomposition and device performance degradation.11,12 Therefore, surface engineering is widely employed as an effective technological strategy to suppress the carrier recombination and film decomposition.13,14 A variety of TiO2 nanostructures such as nanotubes, nanorods, nanocones and nanowires have been constructed to improve the interfacial contact between the mesoporous TiO2 and the perovskite, resulting in better morphology of the perovskite film.15–18 Amongst these means, it has been proved that doping TiO2 with metal ions was an effective method to modify interface states. Pathak et al. have explored an Al-doped TiO2 ETL to passivate defect states and enhance the conductivity by means of low level Al3+ substitution, enabling faster electron collection and less recombination in PSCs.19 Qin et al. have also demonstrated that Y3+ substitution can modify the surface of TiO2 and block the charge recombination in PSCs.20 Especially, rare-earth (RE) ions were treated as a kind of promising dopant, which were generally used to control crystallization and regulate the band structure due to their unique 4f electron structure.21–23 These doping effects have been well studied in dye-sensitized solar cells and photocatalysis.24–26 In PSCs, however, there are fewer reports on the effect of RE dopants. Roose et al. have successfully synthesized a mesostructured TiO2 ETL with Nd3+ doping for PSCs.27 Gao and co-authors have exploited a La3+-doped TiO2 ETL for PSCs to improve their PCE and reduce the hysteresis.28 In PSCs, considering their all-solid-state construction, the effects of RE doping on the band structure and optical properties of TiO2 have not been systematically studied, and the synergistic effects and basic improving mechanism have not been fully understood.
On the other hand, the poor transport properties of TiO2 bulk give rise to electron accumulation and severe recombination, resulting in the decrease of short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage.29,30 Previous reports have recommended several approaches to accelerate internal electron transfer of TiO2 bulk, where the introduction of high electron mobility materials or/and construction of heterojunctions achieved certain effects. For example, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been introduced into the TiO2 network forming the rGO/TiO2 heterojunction to reduce transfer resistance and enhance charge collection.31 Inorganic metal oxide heterojunctions such as ZnO/SnO2 and TiO2/ZnO have also been employed as composite ETLs for PSCs in order to offer analogous benefits.32,33 Similar to these heterojunctions, different crystalline phases of the same material with identical chemical compositions have been synthesized to form the phase junction.34 In particular, mixed-phase TiO2 as a phase junction has revealed a more excellent performance than either pure anatase or rutile single crystal.35,36 It can be expected that, with adjustable surface states and appropriate phase alignment, the TiO2 phase junction has great prospects in all-solid-state PSCs.
Although, to date, a high efficiency of PSCs has been obtained, most assembly processes also have to be operated in a glovebox with inert atmosphere shielding, leading to an increase in cost for their industrial manufacture. Therefore, the exploitation of efficient PSCs in air is highly desired for the cost reduction and actual application. To obtain efficient devices in air, a few attempts, including the introduction of a new lead source and the exploitation of the all-inorganic device structure, have been made.37,38 In our previous research, we have reported an isopropanol-assisted strategy of preparing high-quality perovskite films in air for efficient PSCs.39 Many factors such as temperature, moisture and illumination have an important impact on the device performance, and hence, the fabrication of efficient and stable PSCs in air remains a huge challenge.
Herein, for the first time, we report Er-doped nano-crystalline mixed-phase TiO2 synthesized through a one-step hydrothermal method as an ETL for PSCs. Mesoporous PSCs with a FTO/c-TiO2/Er–TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au architecture are fabricated, whose best PCE increases by 45.8%. Moreover, all assembly processes of PSCs can be totally operated under an ambient atmosphere. We demonstrate that a passivation strategy with Er doping could effectively address the interface defects of TiO2/perovskite. Interestingly, we find that a phase junction can be formed in the mixed crystalline rutile/anatase phase of TiO2 due to the introduction of Er ions achieving more efficient charge separation and faster internal electron transfer. In consequence, the Er-doped device maintains its efficiency over 90% even after 500 hour ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The electronic structure and optical properties of the devices with Er-doped TiO2 have been systematically investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This Er-doped TiO2 ETL provides a new choice for efficient PSCs prepared in ambient air.
Experimental
Chemicals and reagents
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP), erbium(III) chloride, ethylcellulose, and terpineol were purchased from Aladdin. Other anhydrous solvents were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Lead iodide (PbI2), 4-tert-butylpyridine and lithium bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) were supplied by Kanto. Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenyl amino)-9,9′spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) were obtained from Youxuan Trade and Toronto Technologies Co., Ltd, respectively. All chemicals and reagents were used as received without any further purification.
Preparation of TiO2 paste
Er-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized according to the one-step hydrothermal method. First 1 mL acetic acid was added to 5.208 mL titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) with 15 min stirring at room temperature. Then, 25 mL deionized water was poured into the mixture under strong stirring for 1 hour, followed by adding 0.81 mL HCl (37 wt%) with 50 min heat treatment at 80 °C. After cooling to room temperature, a certain amount of Er-chloride was added to the mixture with 30 min stirring. Then the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at 180 °C for 20 h. After natural cooling to room temperature, 0.26 mL HCl (37 wt%) was added with ultrasonic dispersion. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 10000 rpm and washed with deionized water several times. After drying in a vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h, Er-doped TiO2 nanoparticles can be obtained. To prepare the TiO2 paste, 0.08 g ethylcellulose was dissolved in 2.6 mL absolute ethanol, stirring for 2 h until complete dissolution. Then 0.16 g of the as-prepared Er-doped TiO2 was added to the solution with continuous stirring at room temperature. Finally, 1.39 mL terpineol was added dropwise to the solution with ultrasonic dispersion until a stabilized paste was obtained.
Device fabrication and characterization
The etched F-doped SnO2 (FTO) substrates obtained using zinc powder and 2 M HCl were washed with abluent, deionized water, acetone and absolute ethanol and then treated with UV–ozone for 15 min. Then a compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer was deposited by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s, using TTIP solution in weakly acidic (hydrochloric) absolute ethanol with a volume ratio of 1:0.15:14.5, followed by drying at 100 °C for 10 min in air and then annealing at 500 °C for 45 min in a muffle furnace. After that, the Er-doped TiO2 paste was spin-coated onto the c-TiO2/FTO substrate at 4000 rpm for 25 s and annealed at 600 °C for 1 h. For the perovskite layer, the 70 °C PbI2 solution in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) with a concentration of 460 mg mL−1 was spin-coated onto the TiO2 layer (m-TiO2) at 4000 rpm for 10 s. After drying for 10 minutes at 100 °C in air, 60 mg mL−1 CH3NH3I solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 15 s, followed by thermal annealing at 120 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the hole transport layer solution of spiro-OMeTAD in 1 mL chlorobenzene containing the hole transport material spiro-OMeTAD (90 mg) and the additives 17.5 μL Li-TFSI in acetonitrile (520 mg mL−1)/ and 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine was deposited onto the perovskite layer by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an 80 nm-thick Au electrode layer was deposited via vacuum thermal evaporation.
A field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI HELIOS NanoLab 600i) was used to analyze the morphology of the sample. TEM was performed on a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai G2 F20, FEI) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. To characterize the crystal structure and phase of the materials, XRD spectra were collected using an Empyrean Panalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of different films were measured using a UV-visible spectrometer (TU 1901, Beijing Purkinje) with an integrating sphere. PL spectra were recorded on an LS55 Perkin Elmer (PE) fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on an XPS PHI 5400 ESCA system. Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray was used as the excitation source. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2, 94021A, Newport, USA) standardized by a standard Si solar cell (1218, Newport, USA) with an electrochemical workstation (VersaSTAT 3, Ametek, USA). The sweep rate was 0.2 V s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured with the electrochemical workstation; the frequency range is 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz, and the applied bias is −0.90 V. Raman spectra were collected under 532 nm laser excitation on a Renishaw inVia confocal Raman system with a laser power of about 0.06 mW, and the acquisition time was 10 s. The devices and perovskite films used to perform the UV irradiation test are placed in a controlled environment with a 200 W UV lamp. To investigate the water-stability, the perovskite films are stored in air (RH > 50%) and a dry box (RH < 20%). The active area of the cell was confirmed to be 0.12 cm2 using a non-reflective metal mask. Entire fabrication and measurement processes were operated in the ambient environment without humidity control.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the Er-doped TiO2 film fabrication. The TiO2 paste preparation procedure is given in the Experimental section based on TiO2 nanoparticles with different doping ratios of erbium chloride, synthesized with a hydrothermal method.40 Unless otherwise mentioned, the 0.50% Er doped TiO2 is selected as the representative sample in the following discussion according to the photovoltaic performance. The top-down SEM images of undoped and Er-doped TiO2 films are exhibited in Fig. 2a and b. Smaller particles are obtained due to the introduction of Er3+ ions, as previously reported, and the existing Er3+ ions may stabilize amorphous particles in the sol–gel TiO2 precursor and then suppress agglomeration of primary particles.41,42 These smaller particles result in a more uniform porous film in comparison with an undoped TiO2 film, meaning that a larger specific surface area comes into being to hold upper perovskite crystalline grains closely. To confirm the crystal structure of the TiO2 thin films, XRD is conducted, and the results are shown in Fig. 2c, where both the (101) peak of anatase at 25.21° (PDF # 21-1272) and the (110) peak at 27.46° of rutile (PDF # 21-1276) can be found. The other XRD patterns of 0.25%, 0.75%, and 1.00% Er-doped TiO2 are provided in Fig. S1.† From the XRD results, Er2O3 characteristic peaks do not appear in the range of testing angles, indicating that Er3+ ions are incorporated into the TiO2 lattice without crystal structure disruption. Obviously, the relative peak intensity of anatase at 25.21° increases with the Er3+ doping. This indicates that the Er3+ doping can suppress the phase transformation from anatase to rutile, generating a mixed TiO2 phase of anatase and rutile. It is worth noting that the ion radius of Er3+ is much larger than that of Ti4+, meaning that it is hard to replace Ti4+ with Er3+. However, this isomorphous substitution for titanium can proceed during the annealing process, forming a chemical bond of Er–O–Ti in the anatase during heat treatment.43,44 According to the previous reports, this Er–O–Ti bond may increase the phase transition temperature and then restrain the phase transition from anatase to rutile.45,46 As the Er doping ratio increases to 1.00%, only the (101) peak of anatase can be recognised in the XRD pattern. It must be taken into account that the peak at 26.37° in the XRD patterns corresponds to the FTO glass slide used as a substrate during the measurements. The mass ratio of the rutile phase can be calculated using eqn (1) given below: XR = [1 + 0.8(IA/IR)]−1(1)where IA and IR are X-ray diffraction peak integrated intensities of the (101) reflection of anatase and (110) reflection of rutile, respectively.47 The calculated results shown in Table S1† demonstrate that the anatase ratio of the TiO2 films can be controlled through the Er3+ ion doping. The anatase ratio increases with the introduction of Er3+ ions, and anatase and rutile are in almost equal proportions as the Er3+ doping ratio increases to 0.50%. At an Er doping ratio of 1.00%, only anatase is found due to the restriction of Er3+ to the phase transition from anatase to rutile. As shown in Fig. 2d and S2,† the PL spectra of TiO2 films with 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75% and 1.00% and without the Er doping ratio are utilized to investigate the carrier recombination in TiO2 films. It is worth pointing out that the emission bands of Er3+, 2H11/2 to 4I15/2, 4F9/2 to 4I15/2 and 4I9/2 to 4I15/2 at 530, 660, and 800 nm, respectively, can provide certain contributions to the PL intensity. However, there is no direct PL peak of Er3+ emission bands in the spectra consistent with the XRD results mentioned above.23,48 UV-vis spectra are investigated to characterize the influences on light absorption performance (Fig. S3†), showing enhanced absorption features with Er doping within 300–600 nm especially in the visible region corresponding to the excitation of Er3+ species.27 Moreover, a wide absorption peak appears in the 400–550 nm range, which indicates that a new impurity may be introduced according to the literature.49

The oxygen-induced defects located at the interface of TiO2 and perovskite may lead to decomposition of the fragile perovskite films and trapping of the photo-generated carriers.50,51 Therefore, some efforts have been made to passivate these oxygen-induced defects including the introduction of an inert polymer, C-70, and Al2O3.52–54 XPS measurement as an effective detection technique to measure the elemental composition and chemical state can be used to evaluate these oxygen-induced defects in TiO2. As shown in Fig. 3a, both samples are only composed of elements such as Ti and O (284.6 eV binding energy for C 1s is the internal reference). It is worth noting that there are no distinct characteristic peaks of Er in this full XPS spectrum. In Er 4d XPS spectra (Fig. 3b), the weak Er 4d peak at 169.6 eV for the Er-doped TiO2 film indicates that a trace amount of Er3+ ions is successfully introduced into the TiO2 film.55,56 In Ti 2p XPS spectra of both samples (Fig. 3c and d), the Ti 2p3/2 peak at 457.7 and Ti 2p1/2 peak at 463.8 eV are identified, in agreement with titanium in the IV oxidation state.57,58 The O 1s XPS spectra of undoped TiO2 and Er-doped TiO2 are shown in Fig. 3e and f, respectively, and are composed of three O chemical state peaks at 529.2, 530.7, and 532.7 eV (Gaussian distributions) as reported.59 The O 1s peak at a binding energy of 529.2 eV can be attributed to the O–Ti–O bond (denoted as OTi–O). The other two contributive peaks at 530.7 and 532.7 eV can be attributed to the oxygen vacancy (denoted as OV) and hydroxyl oxygen (denoted as OO–H), respectively. Based on the peak area ratios of OTi–O, OV, and OO–H, the relative amount of each O state in the whole O 1s (OTi–O + OV + OO–H) can be estimated (Table 1), among which the OV ratio reflects the oxygen-induced defects closely related to the carrier transport and recombination.60 On doping the TiO2 with Er3+ ions, the area ratio of OV decreases from 25.41% for the undoped TiO2 to 18.56%. These results mean that the oxygen-induced defects abound in the TiO2 films on the one hand and the Er3+ ions can reduce these defects effectively on the other hand. This inhibiting effect of the Er-doped TiO2 system on the oxygen-induced defects might be due to the regulation of Er3+ in the band structure of TiO2. Furthermore, the relative amount of surface hydroxyl groups remarkably reduced in the Er-doped TiO2 system may affect the stability of upper perovskite materials and then shorten the operating life of the PSCs prepared and assembled as mentioned below.61

TEM images are also presented in order to survey the microstructures of TiO2 (Fig. 4a and b), revealing a uniform grain shape and smaller grain size due to the introduction of Er ions. Further inspection by high-resolution TEM (Fig. 4c and d) is carried out to reveal the crystal phase of TiO2. The (110), (210) and (200) planes of rutile appear in the magnified high-resolution TEM images of undoped TiO2 (insets of Fig. 4c) determined by the lattice fringes. It is noteworthy that the clear (101) plane of anatase is identified in the magnified high-resolution TEM images of Er-doped TiO2 (insets of Fig. 4d) in addition to the (110) and (101) planes of rutile.62,63 The TEM and the magnified high-resolution TEM images of 0.25%, 0.75% and 1.00% Er-doped TiO2 are shown in Fig. S4a–f,† indicating the co-existence of anatase and rutile TiO2. These analyses further confirm the existence of mixed phase TiO2.

A two-step sequential solution deposition method is employed to fabricate the perovskite films in air as previously reported (see the detailed procedure in the Experimental section).39,64 To observe the morphology of the perovskite layer, the SEM images are recorded and shown in Fig. 5a–e corresponding to perovskite films onto undoped, 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, and 1.00% Er-doped TiO2 films, respectively. It should be pointed out that no significant differences in morphology are found with the introduction of Er ions into TiO2 films, where compact and uniform perovskite films are prepared in air. To estimate the thickness of the different layers, the cross-sectional SEM image is recorded and shown in Fig. 5f. It is confirmed that an about 200 nm perovskite layer is closely stuck onto the 250–300 nm incorporated layer of m-TiO2 and perovskite. The thickness of the TiO2 and the perovskite layer has a remarkable influence on photocurrents and fill factors.65,66 To improve the light absorption capacity and efficiency, the appropriate thickness of the perovskite layer should be in the range of 400 nm to 500 nm.67 In this work, the mesoporous TiO2 film is stuck onto the perovskite film with a thickness of about 450 nm to extract the carriers, finally forming the combined layers with both remarkable light harvesting and carrier extraction properties. Fig. 6a shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared perovskite films onto undoped, 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, and 1.00% Er-doped TiO2 films, respectively. The tetragonal phase of CH3NH3PbI3 is clearly noticed for films both with and without Er doping. XRD characteristic peaks appear at 14.0°, 24.3°, 28.4°, 31.7°, 40.5°, 43.0°, and 50.3°, corresponding to the (110), (202), (220), (310), (224), (314), and (404) planes of CH3NH3PbI3, respectively.68,69 This means that PbI2 is successfully converted into CH3NH3PbI3. A mesoporous device with the FTO/c-TiO2/Er–TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au architecture is constructed to evaluate the influence of Er-doped TiO2 on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, where the as-prepared TiO2 with different Er doping ratios is selected as the mesoporous n-type ETL.

To assess the air-stability, the Raman spectra of perovskite films on these two TiO2 substrates stored in air (RH > 55%) and controlled humidity (RH < 20%) are recorded, respectively. The peak located at around 96 cm−1 corresponds to the PbI2,70 which is derived from the decomposition of perovskite materials. As shown in Fig. S5a–d,† both perovskite films on different TiO2 substrates stored in controlled humidity (RH < 20%) do not exhibit significant degeneration during the whole storage period. When the relative humidity is over 50%, however, this desirable situation for the perovskite film on the undoped TiO2 substrate has changed. After 6 day storage in air, a weak PbI2 peak appears in the Raman spectra of the perovskite film on the undoped TiO2 substrate. The perovskite films prepared onto the Er-doped TiO2 substrates show excellent chemical stability both in air (RH > 55%) and controlled humidity (RH < 20%). This stability improvement benefits from both the reduction of interface defects and elimination of hydroxyl groups due to the introduction of Er ions.
To evaluate the effects of Er-doped TiO2 on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices with forward and reverse scans shown in Fig. 6b and S6a–c† are measured under AM1.5 G illumination, showing that the devices with Er doping yield higher PCEs than the undoped ones. Table 2 lists the PCEs, short-circuit current densities (Jscs), open-circuit voltages (Vocs) and fill factors (FFs) of champion devices with forward and reverse scans corresponding to different Er doping ratios. It is obviously seen that similar Jscs with different Er doping ratios have been obtained; however, the Vocs of the devices with Er-doped TiO2 are significantly improved. It is worth noting that with the increase of the Er doping ratio to 1.00% the PCE decreases instead. Such a performance decrease mainly due to the poor Voc can be attributed to more surface defects and charge imbalance due to excess of Er ions, producing more recombination centers for electrons and holes. The best photovoltaic performance of the device with 0.50% Er doping is comprehensively superior to that of the devices with other doping ratios, yielding a PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF with the reverse scan of 14.06%, 20.28 mA cm−2, 1.03 V and 67.31% although they drop to 11.04%, 20.07 mA cm−2, 0.97 V and 56.71% with the forward scan, respectively. By comparison, the device with undoped TiO2 only yields a PCE, Jsc, Voc and FF with the reverse scan of 9.64%, 18.43 mA cm−2, 0.961 V and 57.48%, dropping to 7.58%, 18.17 mA cm−2, 0.86 V and 48.51% with the forward scan, respectively. The monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of the PSCs are recorded and shown in Fig. 6c. It is shown that a 75–80% IPCE value of the device with 0.50% Er-doped TiO2 is obtained across 420–700 nm wavelength coverage; by contrast, only a 60–75% IPCE value of the device with undoped TiO2 is obtained across the same wavelength coverage. The calculated Jscs of 18.75 mA cm−2 (Er-doped TiO2) and 16.86 mA cm−2 (undoped TiO2) have been obtained by integrating the IPCE spectrum, which is in agreement with the J–V results. Moreover, the PCE statistic histograms of 50 samples for the devices with undoped TiO2 and Er-doped TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6d. The devices with Er-doped TiO2 exhibit higher PCE values distributed in the range of 12–14%, which are better than those of the devices with undoped TiO2 (7–9%).

The electron extraction of the TiO2 layer by introducing Er ions is investigated by the PL measurements, and the results are shown in Fig. 7a. The perovskite films are prepared with an identical method and under identical conditions onto undoped, 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, and 1.00% Er-doped TiO2 films, respectively. The quenching effects of ETLs result in the decrease of PL intensity. These spectra reveal that Er-doped TiO2, as compared to the perovskite film on undoped TiO2, quenches the emission of the perovskite film. When the Er doping ratio is 0.50%, the Er-doped TiO2 layer presents the best electron extraction properties.71 EIS is carried out under dark conditions to investigate the dynamics of photo-generated electrons in PSCs in the 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz frequency range, and the Nyquist plots are shown as Fig. 7b. It is clearly seen that there is only one semicircle in the Nyquist diagram in accordance with experimental results reported in the literature.72,73 Moreover, the equivalent circuit model fitting of the Nyquist plots with Z-view software is shown in the inset of Fig. 7b. Rs is the series resistance including the resistance of the FTO glass, the interfacial resistance and the wire resistance. Rrec is the recombination resistance related to electron recombination. According to the equivalent circuit model fitting, the Rrec can be calculated using the semicircle in the Nyquist diagram, and a larger Rrec means less recombination. The Rrec value is increased from 349 Ω to 984 Ω with the Er doping ratio increasing from undoped to 0.75% as shown in Table S1.† As the Er doping ratio increases to 1.00%, a Rrec value of 234 Ω is calculated, even smaller than that of the undoped device, indicating that the excess introduction of Er may produce more defects and recombination centers. It should also be noted that the devices with 0.50% Er doping also show a larger Rrec value of 771 Ω. The increased interfacial resistance will suppress recombination of the TiO2 conduction band to spiro-MeOTAD as reported.74 As for the recombination resistance, the devices with m-TiO2 with 0.50% and 0.75% Er doping can effectively extract the electrons and suppress the recombination, and these results are consistent with the J–V measurements. It is indicated that the doped Er3+ ions may occupy the unstable Ti3+ interface defects arising from oxygen vacancies, which resembled the TiO2 with Al doping.19 The removal of defects suppresses the formation of recombination centers and then accelerates the electron injection from perovskite to TiO2. By the proper introduction of Er3+ ions, a passivation layer has been successfully constructed at the interface of TiO2 and MAPbI3.

It is well known that the ETL plays a key role in the extraction and transfer of photo-induced electrons. According to the TEM and XRD analysis, the introduction of Er ions can suppress phase transition from anatase to rutile during the annealing process and then produce an anatase/rutile phase junction. The improvement mechanism of the anatase/rutile phase junction for PSCs has been discussed in detail focusing on the crystal phase and band structures of TiO2. According to the above steady state PL results and XPS analyses, the Er-doped TiO2 ETL shows a more effective quenching effect, meaning that the gradual energy level is conducive to the electron extraction and transfer.75 It is widely accepted that the electron mobility of anatase is higher than that of rutile, accelerating the electron transfer. According to previous reports, the existing rutile in the mixed-phase TiO2 phase junction can also bridge the electron transport highways and facilitate the charge transfer.76 It has also been reported that a built-in electric field, generated in the phase junction from rutile to anatase, promotes charge separation and inhibits carrier recombination.77,78 This built-in electric field can facilitate the enhancement of the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with the Er-doped TiO2 phase junction ETL.
Nowadays, the stability issue in PSCs has turned out to be one primary bottleneck restricting the actual production and application in future. Particularly, perovskite materials suffer from UV-induced degradation due to the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. It is still a challenge to avoid the damage to the perovskite layer from UV irradiation. In this work, the PSC with the Er-doped anatase/rutile TiO2 phase junction is expected to have the ability to resist the degeneration under UV irradiation. To evaluate the ultraviolet stability, we carry out UV-stability tests for representative devices with TiO2 and Er-doped TiO2, and investigate the ultraviolet-induced degradation processes of perovskite films onto the TiO2 and Er-doped TiO2 layers using Raman spectra. The UV stability measurements for the device are performed in a controlled environment with the 200 W UV lamp.
According to the decline curves of PCEs under UV irradiation in Fig. 8a, it serves to show that the ultraviolet light has an effect on device performance indeed. Gratifyingly, the Er-doped devices present superior anti-ultraviolet ability, still maintaining over 90% of the initial PCE value even after 500 hour UV irradiation. In terms of UV resistance, the unmodified device is dramatically inferior to the Er-doped device, and the rest of the PCE of the unmodified device is less than 65%. To observe the device degradations visually, the photographs of the undoped and Er-doped devices after 500 hour UV irradiation are shown in Fig. 8b. The decomposition under UV irradiation of the undoped device has an impact on the morphology, and by contrast, no significant morphological change for the Er-doped device is observed. Using the Raman signals from the degradation product of PbI2 (peak at ∼96 cm−1), the degradation processes of perovskite films onto the TiO2 and Er-doped TiO2 layers under UV irradiation can be investigated. As shown in Fig. 8c and d, there are no distinct peaks at 96 cm−1 for the perovskite films onto Er-doped TiO2 even after 500 hour UV irradiation. However, these decomposition behaviors of the perovskite films on undoped TiO2 have been observed clearly only after 200 hour UV irradiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the photo-induced decomposition effect of the perovskite film has been effectually suppressed. The chemical instability of the perovskite film especially under UV irradiation is identified as the culprit in PCE degeneration, which is closely correlated to the oxygen vacancies and photo-induced holes in TiO2.79 The oxygen vacancies at the interface can provide adsorption sites for the oxygen, and then this adsorbed oxygen can interact with the holes in the TiO2 induced by the UV irradiation.80,81 As demonstrated by the XPS results above, the oxygen vacancies in TiO2 films have been dramatically reduced by the introduction of Er ions, readily leading to the occurrence of degeneration sites. Hence, the adsorptive capability of oxygen can be decreased due to the reduction of oxygen vacancies, which is beneficial to the stability improvement of the photovoltaic device. Moreover, the anatase/rutile TiO2 can provide unimpeded channels for the extraction of photo-induced electrons, finally accelerating the photo-generated extraction and then suppressing the photo-induced holes in TiO2. Taken together, the reduction of oxygen vacancies and suppression of photo-induced holes in Er-doped TiO2 synergistically promote the UV stability of PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, we employed a mesoporous Er-doped TiO2 phase junction in PSCs as an ETL. With a FTO/c-TiO2/Er–TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au architecture, efficient and stable mesoporous PSCs have been constructed completely under an ambient atmosphere. The Er doping resulted in the decrease of oxygen-induced defects at the TiO2/perovskite interface, leading to the increase of photocurrent. Moreover, the mixed TiO2 phase junction can be formed due to the Er doping, which can achieve efficient charge separation and accelerate internal electron transfer. It has been demonstrated that the band structure and optical properties of TiO2 with Er doping appropriately match with those of the perovskite light-harvesting layer. The degradation processes of perovskite films under UV irradiation and in different relative humidities have been investigated using Raman spectra, and the perovskite films onto Er-doped TiO2 reveal better moisture-resistant and ultraviolet resistant abilities. Ultimately, the Er-doped devices still maintain over 90% of their initial PCE value even after 500 hour UV irradiation. This improvement in their performance can be attributed to the interface passivation of TiO2/perovskite and the built-in electric field in the TiO2 phase junction. We believe that this Er-doped TiO2 provides a new choice for efficient PSCs prepared in air.
