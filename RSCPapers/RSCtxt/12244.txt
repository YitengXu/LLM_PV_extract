    , Accepted 9th June 2017First published on 12th June 2017AbstractIn the past few decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs), while their comprehensive performance including high efficiency, fulfilling the prerequisites of solution printing technology (active layer thickness >200 nm) and long-term thermal stability, which are essential for the practical application of OSCs, have not been paid adequate attention yet. In this communication, two novel wide band gap (WBG) polymers of PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S were designed and synthesized. PBTIBDTT devices exhibit a high PCE of 9.42%, which is one of the highest values reported for OSCs fabricated from WBG materials and the PCEs could remain above 8.6% as the active layer thickness further increased to 280 nm. More importantly, the device displays remarkable thermal stability for 120 hours at 100 °C. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to report a WBG material that features excellent comprehensive performance, which would open a new avenue to design meaningful conjugated copolymers towards future practical applications.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) composed of a conjugated copolymer and a fullerene derivative/non-fullerene n-type organic semiconductor acceptor have recently received great attention as the most promising renewable energy source because of their unique advantages such as low cost, light weight, flexibility and compatibility with the roll to roll (R2R) technique.1–6 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 11% have been achieved in a single-junction device.7–9 However, for the desired donor material in fullerene based OSCs (FOSCs), there are two essential problems besides the efficiency, which have not been paid adequate attention yet. In order to continuously promote the development of OSCs towards practical application, the two problems have to be simultaneously surmounted. Firstly, most of the high PCEs were typically reached with an active layer thickness of ca. 100 nm and the device performance sharply degraded with increasing active layer thickness.10–12 It is of great urgency to develop highly efficient OSCs with thick active layers (>200 nm) which would be not only viable to acquire uniform and pinhole-free large-area films for fulfilling the prerequisites of solution printing technology, but also more efficient to utilize the incident light.13,14 Secondly, during device operation, the accumulated heat from sunlight irradiation would induce excessive macrophase aggregation within the active layer, resulting in the decline of PCEs.15 Thermal stability is the greatest obstacle in achieving large-scale commercialization in comparison to oxidation and light stability which could be significantly improved by removing the residual solvents and external encapsulation technique.16,17 Many methods, such as introducing an intermolecular crosslinker or compatibilizer and designing amorphous fullerene acceptors, have been developed to freeze the optimal morphology to improve the device thermal stability. However, these methods usually depend on complicated synthetic procedures and the device efficiencies usually suffer.18,19
In the past decade, extensive research efforts on new material development have been devoted to narrow the band gap to increase light harvesting, and the PCEs of OSCs made from low band gap (LBG, Eg < 1.6 eV) and medium band gap (MBG, 1.6 eV < Eg < 1.8 eV) materials have been significantly advanced.20 Currently, driven by the rapid development of non-fullerene acceptor materials and tandem solar cells, wide band gap (WBG) copolymers (Eg > 1.8 eV) play a more and more crucial role in realizing high performance OSCs.21–29 However, most of the reported WBG devices are seriously sensitive to the active layer thickness and the long-term thermal stability of the device based on these materials is poor, which significantly prevents the future commercial application of FOSCs. These are common problems not only for WBG materials, but also for LBG and MBG materials.30,31 Considering future mass production through roll-to-roll technology and real application under illumination, it is of great importance to directly design and synthesize materials that feature excellent comprehensive performance including high efficiency, fulfilling the prerequisites of solution printing technology and long-term thermal stability to meet the requirements of practical application.
Generally speaking, extended π-conjugation can effectively enhance the absorption coefficient, crystallinity and charge carrier transport of the materials by reducing the conformation disorder of the backbone and increasing the molecular rigidity in the film state to facilitate electron delocalization.32 The improved crystallinity and charge carrier transport can decrease the recombination of holes and electrons in the active layer, which would benefit to achieve a high PCE with a thick active layer. From this point of view, two novel WBG copolymers PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S, which are composed of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) donor units (D) and 2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-imide (BTI) acceptor units (A), were designed and synthesized. Among possible acceptor units, 2,2′-bithiophene-3,3′-imide (BTI) was chosen as an acceptor unit due to its outstanding characteristics: (i) the strong electron-withdrawing property provides a wide range to manipulate the frontier molecular orbitals and band gaps; (ii) the π-extended and planar fused heteroarene structure facilitates efficient intermolecular charge transport. Many copolymers based on the BTI unit have been reported and demonstrated excellent photovoltaic performance.33–35 However, the famous 2D-BDT units have not been combined with BTI units to construct novel copolymers to improve the device performance so far. Motivated by this, the symmetric and planar BDT units that carried (2-ethylhexyl)thienyl and (2-ethylhexylthio)thienyl side chains were taken as donor units to construct 2D conjugated copolymers in order to achieve broad light absorption, tight and regular stacking, and efficient charge transport. The two copolymers constructed from BDT and BTI units in this communication display wide band gaps (ca. 1.87 eV) with broad absorption ranges from 300–670 nm. The device based on PBTIBDTT-S as a donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an acceptor exhibits a PCE of 8.02%, while the PBTIBDTT device shows a PCE of 9.42%, which is among the highest values reported for single-junction solar cells based on WBG materials. Most importantly, the efficiencies of PBTIBDTT devices can maintain above 8.6% as the active layer thickness further increased to 280 nm and the device could also retain above 80% of its best efficiency after the accelerated aging experiment at 100 °C for 120 hours. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to report a WBG material that shows outstanding comprehensive performance including high efficiency, fulfilling the prerequisites of solution printing technology and long-term thermal stability, which would open a new avenue to design materials with excellent integrated performance that simultaneously fulfills the prerequisites of solution printing technology and practical application.
The synthetic routes of PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S are shown in Scheme 1. BTI and BDT building blocks were prepared according to the literature.36–38 In order to facilitate interchain order packing, 3-decylthiophenes were inserted into the polymeric backbone as π-spacers between the BDT and BTI units to reduce the steric hindrance and improve the solubility of the polymers. Both copolymers were synthesized through the Stille coupling reaction in toluene with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. The detailed synthetic procedures and characterization of the polymers are presented in the ESI.† Both PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S are readily soluble in commonly used solvents, such as chlorobenzene (CB), o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and chloroform at room temperature. The molecular weights of both polymers were measured by using a high temperature gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) at 130 °C with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and polydispersity indexes (PDI) are 36.1 kDa and 2.02, and 25.8 kDa and 2.71 for PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S, respectively. The decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% of weight loss of PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S are 420 °C and 327 °C, respectively, and the lower Td value of PBTIBDTT-S is attributed to the alkylthio side chains appending on BDT units (Fig. S3†). Through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, no discernible endo- and exothermic processes were observed in the temperature range of 0–380 °C and 0–300 °C for PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S, respectively (Fig. S4†).

The UV-vis absorption spectra of PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S are shown in Fig. 1a. In dilute CB solution, both polymers exhibit two main well-defined absorption peaks, one at a higher energy band (300–400 nm) attributed to the π–π* transition and the other one located at a lower energy band (500–650 nm). In the solid state, the absorption of PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S shows similar optical properties with a slight redshift in comparison to that in solution. Moreover, pronounced vibronic peaks at ca. 610 nm are observed in solutions and thin films suggesting efficient molecular packing.39,40 The optical band gaps evaluated from the absorption onsets are 1.87 eV and 1.88 eV for PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S, respectively. The similar optical band gaps indicate that the alkylthio side chain on BDT units has a slight influence on the bandgap. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to estimate their electrochemical properties, as shown in Fig. 1b. The onsets of the oxidation potential of PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S appeared at 1.11 V and 1.17 V, corresponding to the HOMO energy levels of −5.47 eV and −5.53 eV for PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S, respectively. The low-lying HOMO energy levels would be beneficial to achieve high Vocs. It could also be observed that the introduction of (alkylthio)thienyl side chains on the main chains lowers the HOMO level by about 0.06 eV, and a higher Voc can be expected for the PBTIBDTT-S device.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, using the B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) basic set, were performed to predict the geometric and electronic structures of PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S. To simplify the calculations, all alkyl and alkylthio side chains were replaced by methyl and methylthio groups, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1c and d. DFT calculations based on the trimers of PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S were performed to evaluate the planarity of both polymers. The polymeric backbones of both polymers display nearly planar structures, which are favorable to get ordered packing and high carrier mobility.41 The LUMO and HOMO energy levels acquired from the calculations are −2.67 eV and −4.87 eV, and −2.75 eV and −4.99 eV for PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S trimers (Fig. S5†), respectively, and the variation trend of these values is in good accordance with the CV results.
The photovoltaic performance of both polymers was investigated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The active layers of both polymers were systematically optimized in terms of the ratio of polymer to fullerene, the amount of solvent additive, methanol treatment and thermal annealing to maximize the device efficiencies. Details of device fabrication and optimization procedures are provided in the ESI† and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Tables S2 and S3.† Without using 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive, both PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S devices directly spin-coated from CB solution with a polymer/PC71BM ratio of 1:1 exhibited relatively low PCEs of 2.69% and 2.01%, respectively. In order to achieve the best photovoltaic performance, the morphology of the active layer was optimized by adding different amounts of DIO as the solvent additive, and the optimal DIO concentration was found to be 1.0 vol% for both polymers. The ratios of the polymer to PC71BM were 1:2 and 1:1 for PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S, respectively. For the PBTIBDTT device, the champion PCE was finally achieved by treating the top of the active layer with methanol and then by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min, while the PBTIBDTT-S device attained the best PCE by only using methanol treatment. The typical J–V curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 2a and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PBTIBDTT device exhibited a PCE of 9.42% with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 14.53 mA cm−2 and an FF of 71.29% with an active layer thickness of 225 nm, which is one of the highest PCEs for OSCs based on WBG copolymers. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first time to report a device with such a high PCE with an active layer thickness over 200 nm for WBG copolymers, which would be beneficial to solution printing technology, as discussed in the following. For PBTIBDTT-S, the optimized device showed a relatively lower PCE of 8.02% with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 11.98 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69.76% with an active layer thickness of 78 nm. The higher Voc of the PBTIBDTT-S device than that of the PBTIBDTT device is in rough agreement with the HOMO alignment of the polymers, while the inferior Jsc compared with that of the state-of-the-art PBTIBDTT device is attributed to the thinner active layer in the optimized PBTIBDTT-S device. We also tried to increase the thickness of the active layer to improve the light utilization and Jsc for the PBTIBDTT-S device. However, the FF declined significantly, while the enhancement in Jsc was negligible, which probably resulted from the low charge carrier mobility of PBTIBDTT-S arose from its low molecular weight. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized devices are depicted in Fig. 2b. The PBTIBDTT-S device exhibited a broad spectral response in the 300–700 nm region with a maximum EQE value of 76% at ca. 460 nm. In contrast, the PBTIBDTT device displayed higher EQE values in the whole range with a peak EQE value of 81% at ca. 470 nm due to its relatively thicker active layer, resulting in a larger Jsc value. The current density values calculated from the EQE spectra were in good agreement with the Jsc values obtained from J–V curves within 5% deviation. The hole mobilities (μh) of the polymer/PC71BM blend films were investigated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) model, and the detailed procedure is presented in the ESI.† The PBTIBDTT/PC71BM blend displays a hole mobility of 1.95 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is four times higher than that of the PBTIBDTT-S/PC71BM blend (4.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), as shown in Table S5.† The higher hole mobility of the PBTIBDTT blend film guarantees efficient charge transport, which is responsible for the excellent performance of the PBTIBDTT device.

To better understand the devices’ performance, the microstructural changes of polymer/PC71BM blend films were investigated by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The TEM images of the pristine and optimized blend films of PBTIBDTT/PC71BM and PBTIBDTT-S/PC71BM are shown in Fig. 3 and the course of microstructural evolution of the blend films under different treatments is shown in Fig. S6.† The pristine blend films of PBTIBDTT/PC71BM and PBTIBDTT-S/PC71BM directly spin-coated from CB solution showed large domains with diameters larger than hundreds of nanometers. The large domains lead to a significant decline of charge carrier generation and a concomitantly low photocurrent, due to the limited diffusion length of excitons (ca. 10 nm) and the decreased donor/acceptor interfacial area for exciton dissociation.42 In contrast, the large aggregation and domains completely disappeared and interpenetrating networks with clear polymer fibrils were formed for the optimized blend films of PBTIBDTT/PC71BM and PBTIBDTT-S/PC71BM, as shown in Fig. 3b and d. The fibrillar structures are favorable to the charge separation and transport, thus higher Jsc and FF for the optimized PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S devices were achieved. It could also be observed that the PBTIBDTT/PC71BM blend developed finer fibrils than the PBTIBDTT-S/PC71BM blend, which is responsible for its better device performance.

Two-dimensional grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) was used to examine the crystallinity and molecular orientation of the pure polymer and optimized blend films (Fig. 4). Since the (010) diffraction in the out-of-plane direction is due to π–π stacking and both neat films show stronger diffraction signals in the out-of-plane direction in comparison to the in-plane direction, it could be concluded that the molecules in both neat films are predominantly arranged with a face-on structure. For the PBTIBDTT film, a much stronger (010) π–π stacking peak locates at qz = 16.89 nm−1, corresponding to a d-spacing of 3.72 Å. In contrast, a relatively weaker (010) π–π stacking peak is observed at qz = 16.94 nm−1, corresponding to a d-spacing of 3.71 Å for the PBTIBDTT-S film. In the low q range, the PBTIBDTT film shows a pronounced (100) lamellar packing diffraction peak in the in-plane direction at qxy = 2.69 nm−1 (corresponding to a lamellar d-spacing of 23.36 Å), while a much weaker (100) diffraction peak at qxy = 2.57 nm−1 (corresponding to a lamellar d-spacing of 24.45 Å) for the PBTIBDTT-S film is observed. These results demonstrated the higher crystallinity of the PBTIBDTT film in comparison to the PBTIBDTT film. For both the optimized blend films, the intensity of π–π stacking diffraction peaks significantly decreased, and the π–π stacking distances reduced to 3.67 Å (qz = 17.12 nm−1) and 3.68 Å (qz = 17.07 nm−1) for PBTIBDTT/PC71BM and PBTIBDTT-S/PC71BM blend films, respectively (Fig. 4c and d). Despite their similar π–π stacking distance and molecular orientation, the (010) diffraction peak of the PBTIBDTT/PC71BM blend film is more prominent than that of the PBTIBDTT-S/PC71BM blend film. The high crystallinity and favorable molecular arrangement of the PBTIBDTT copolymer contributed to its high carrier mobility and excellent device performance. We conjectured that the higher molecular weight for PBTIBDTT is responsible for the better interchain interaction (36.1 kDa vs. 25.8 kDa), while the influence of the sulfur atom located at the conjugated side chain is minimal.

The tolerance of PCE to the variation of the active layer thickness is one key point for future solution printing technology. Generally, with increasing active layer thickness, the Jsc is expected to enhance because of improved light absorption, whereas the FF decreases due to the increased space charge accumulation and probability of charge recombination in the thick active layer. The effect of the active layer thickness on the PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S device performance was systematically investigated and the corresponding parameters are collected in Table 2 and Table S6,† respectively. As shown in Table 2, the Voc values maintained at a high voltage of ca. 0.9 V for the PBTIBDTT device, which resulted from the low HOMO value. The Jscs of PBTIBDTT devices were significantly affected by the variation of the active layer thickness, and displayed a region of 13.02–14.53 mA cm−2. However, the FFs declined slightly with increasing active layer thickness, and the device could still provide an FF over 70% with an active layer thickness over 280 nm. Thus, the highest PCE of 9.42% was finally achieved with an active layer thickness of 225 nm, and the PCEs were all above 8.5% as the active layer thickness further increased to 280 nm. The thickness dependence of the PBTIBDTT-S device performance was also studied, and the PCE significantly decreased with the increase of active layer thickness, as shown in Table S6.† The light dependence of Jsc was measured to probe the charge recombination behavior, as shown in Fig. S7.† The relationship between Jsc and P can be described by the power-law equation Jsc ∝ Pα. If all the charges are swept out and collected by the electrode before recombination, the calculated α ought to be 1, while α < 1 suggests the existence of charge recombination. The calculated α value for PBTIBDTT is 0.933, which is higher than 0.919 for the PBTIBDTT-S device. This implies that less bimolecular recombination happened in the PBTIBDTT device, supporting its high Jsc and FF. The light-intensity dependence of Voc was also examined to provide insight into the role of trap-assisted recombination. The Voc and the logarithm of light intensity were fit to a linear relationship according to the equation Voc ∝ nkT/qln(P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, q is the element charge and P is the light intensity, as shown in Fig. S7b.† The PBTIBDTT device has a weaker dependence of Voc on the light intensity with a smaller slope of 1.23kT/q with respect to 1.28kT/q for the PBTIBDTT-S device. This result provides evidence that the trapping centers of the PBTIBDTT device are less than those of the PBTIBDTT-S device.43,44 The tolerance of PCE to the variation of the active layer thickness for the PBTIBDTT device, arising from its high crystallinity and favorable molecular orientation, provides a wide processing window to fabricate large-area solar cells via solution printing technology.

The thermal stability of PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S devices was also characterized by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 120 hours as accelerated aging experiment to assess the feasibility of practical applications. For clear comparison, the thermal stability of the classical PTB7-Th device is also shown in Fig. 5 as the control. A strong PCE decay was found for both devices based on PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S within the first 24 hours, and then the efficiencies of both polymers entered into a stable stage and almost remained unchanged. The identical variation trend for these devices might relate to the same molecular backbones of the polymers. After thermal annealing for 120 hours, the efficiency of the PBTIBDTT-S device showed 27.3% decrement and the PBTIBDTT device exhibited 19.1% reduction in PCE (Fig. 5). The more detailed parameters on the nature of device degradation are collected in Table S8–S10.† For the PBTIBDTT-S device, the PCE decay mainly arises from a combined reduction in FF and Jsc at the beginning of the aging experiment, while the prominent decline for the PBTIBDTT device originates from the decreased FF. However, the thermal stability of both PBTBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S devices is much better than that of PTB7-Th devices. The outstanding thermal stability for PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S devices must be closely related to their rigid backbone and high crystallinity. The morphological changes of PBTIBDTT/PC71BM and PBTIBDTT-S/PC71BM blend films after thermal annealing were characterized, as shown in Fig. S6d and S6h.† After thermal annealing at 100 °C for 120 hours, large PC71BM rich domains were formed for both PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S devices (as shown in Fig. S6†). The large PC71BM aggregation was harmful for the exciton dissociation and increases the probability of charge recombination, in good agreement with the decreased device performance. While the changes of the crystalline structure of the blends were negligible after thermal annealing as shown in Fig. S8b,† indicating that the polymer networks were strong enough to resist the thermal stress. The decreased device efficiencies mainly arose from the diffusion and aggregation of the PC71BM molecules. The excellent long-term thermal stability affords an opportunity for PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S as a potential donor material in practical applications.

In conclusion, two new WBG polymers PBTIBDTT and PBTIBDTT-S with extended π-conjugation to reduce the conformation disorder and enhance the crystallinity and charge carrier transport of the materials have been designed and fully characterized. As expected, both the polymers afforded affirmative properties such as wide band gaps, low lying HOMO energy levels, high crystallinity and favorable molecular orientation. Particularly, the PBTIBDTT device exhibited a high PCE of 9.42%, which is one of the highest values reported for OSCs fabricated from WBG materials in the fullerene system. And the PCEs could maintain above 8.6% as the thickness of the active layer further increased to 280 nm, which provides a wide processing window to acquire uniform and pinhole-free large-area OSCs via solution printing technology. More importantly, the PBTIBDTT device displayed remarkable thermal stability and could retain above 80% of its best performance after the accelerated aging experiment at 100 °C for 120 hours. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to report a WBG copolymer for OSCs with excellent comprehensive performance including high efficiency, fulfilling the prerequisites of solution printing technology and long-term thermal stability, which would guide the design and synthesis of novel molecules towards future practical applications.
