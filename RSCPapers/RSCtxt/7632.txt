    , Accepted 29th March 2017First published on 29th March 2017AbstractThe conversion of greenhouse gas CO2 into novel materials is the most promising approach to solve greenhouse gas issues. Herein, we report for the first time the reaction of potassium with CO2 to synthesize three-dimensional honeycomb-like structured graphene (3DHG). Furthermore, 3DHG exhibited excellent performance as a counter electrode for hole transport material (HTM)-free perovskite solar cells, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 10.06%. This work constitutes a new aspect of potassium chemistry for material synthesis from a greenhouse gas and the generation of electrical energy from sunlight.
The content of CO2, which is a major greenhouse gas causing global warming, has been increasing steadily in the atmosphere over the past century. Several technologies are commercially available to capture CO2.1–3 However, CO2 storage is still a challenge due to its leakage from storage media and high sequestration costs.4–6 CO2 conversion is a promising way to solve this issue with various strategies, such as catalyzed chemical, thermochemical, electrochemical, photochemical, and photoelectrochemical processes.7,8 In recent years, Hu's group has explored the possibility of CO2 conversion directly into novel solid materials, such as carbon nitride, lithium cyanamide, 3D cauliflower-fungus-like graphene (CFG), and crape myrtle flower-like graphene.9–11
Potassium, which is the second least dense metal, is of great importance for soil health, plant growth and animal nutrition. Furthermore, it plays a critical role in the fluid system and nerve functions of humans. However, to the best our knowledge, no attempt has been made to exploit potassium metal for the conversion of a greenhouse gas into novel solid materials. In this communication, we demonstrate that potassium can react with CO2 to form a new type of 3D graphene sheet. Furthermore, these graphene sheets exhibited excellent performance as a counter electrode for HTM-free perovskite solar cells with a high efficiency up to 10.06%.
In this work, the following potassium reaction is designed to convert CO2 into graphene-structured carbon. 4K + 3CO2 → C (graphene) + 2K2CO3(1)
This reaction was examined by thermodynamic calculations. As shown in Fig. 1, the Gibbs free energy change is negative, indicating its thermodynamically favorable features. Its negative enthalpy change reveals that it is exothermic. Furthermore, K2CO3, which is formed simultaneously with graphene, can play two important roles during the process: (1) prevention of graphite formation by isolating graphene sheets from each other and (2) control of the shape of graphene as an in situ template, as shown in Fig. S1.† This novel strategy was further confirmed experimentally as follows.
 Fig. 1  Reaction between K and CO2 to form graphene and K2CO3: (a) changes of Gibbs free energy and enthalpy vs. temperature for the reaction. (b) XRD patterns of solid products from the reaction. (c) XRD patterns of the carbon material obtained by treating the solid products with HCl. 
0.1 mol of potassium (from Aldrich) reacted with CO2 in a batch ceramic-tube reactor at a temperature of 550 °C and an initial pressure of 50 psi for a selected time (12, 24, or 48 h). The products were subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) evaluations. Fig. 1b shows the formation of K2CO3, confirming the proposed reaction. After K2CO3 was removed by HCl treatment, the obtained black powder was identified as carbon with oxygen functional groups by elemental analysis and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) (Table 1). The XRD patterns of the carbon presents a diffraction peak at 2θ = 25.91°, which can be indexed to the (002) plane of the graphitic structure. Another peak at 43.22° is associated with the (100) plane. The broad peaks were observed due to the wrinkled and folded structure of carbon, which was further confirmed by FESEM and TEM images in the following discussion. The thickness of the primary crystal layer, which was calculated with the Scherrer equation from XRD peak widths at half heights, is about 2.8 nm. Furthermore, the average interlayer space of the material is 3.44 Å, which is larger than the interlayer space of graphite. This indicates that each of the layer consists of 8 graphene sheets. Furthermore, field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images show that the synthesized carbon has a three-dimensional honeycomb-like framework (Fig. 2a–c). The thickness of each layer estimated from the FESEM images is about 3.0 nm, which is consistent with that (about 2.8 nm) estimated from XRD. As a general definition, the graphene material is a carbon layer consisting of 10 or less graphene sheets. Therefore, the synthesized carbon is 3D honeycomb-structured graphene (3DHG). The 3DHG samples obtained with reaction times of 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h are denoted as 3DHG-12, 3DHG-24, and 3DHG-48, respectively. The microstructures of 3DHG were further evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 2d, one can see that one graphene sheet exhibits a typical wrinkled structure with corrugation and scrolling like crumpled silk veil waves. Furthermore, the curved shapes were further supported by electron diffraction that shows poly-crystalline ring patterns.

The oxygen functional groups and defects of 3DHG were evaluated by using Raman and XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 3a, the Raman spectra of 3DHG exhibit a clear G peak at 1580 cm−1, providing evidence of an sp2 bonded carbon. A strong D peak at about 1350 cm−1 was also observed, indicating rich defects in the graphene sheets. Fig. S2† shows the XPS spectra of 3DHG. The deconvolution of the C1s peak revealed four components centered at 284.6, 286.4, 288.5, and 290.5 eV, which would be associated with C–C, C–O, CO, and O–CO, respectively. The main component is sp2 bonded carbon (81.4%). Furthermore, the surface area and pore structure of 3DHG were determined by N2 adsorption. Fig. 3b–d show a type II isotherm with a type H3 hysteresis loop, indicating that 3DHG sheets possess a mesoporous structure. This was supported by the pore size distribution ranging from 5 to 90 nm (Fig. S3a–c†). The specific surface areas, which were calculated with the BET model, are 946, 906, and 630 m2 g−1 for 3DHG-12, 3DHG-24, and 3DHG-48, respectively. Furthermore, the sheet resistances of 3DHG films, which were also measured by four-point probe analysis, are 5.13, 4.81, and 3.97 kΩ sq−1 for 3DHG-12, 3DHG-24, and 3DHG-48, respectively. This indicates that 3DHG materials possess high conductivity and large surface areas. In other words, they would be promising electrode materials for energy devices.

Solar cells have been recognized as one of the most promising technologies to relieve the global energy crisis and warming effect.12 Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are attracting extensive attention due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has surpassed that of both dye-sensitized and organic solar cells and is approaching that of inorganic solar cells such as CdTe, CIGS, and even crystalline Si solar cells.13,14 In the conventional structure of PSCs, small organic molecules (such as Spiro-OMeTAD) or organic polymers (such as P3HT, PEDOT:PSS, and PTAA) are employed as hole transport materials (HTMs), and noble Au or Ag is used as a counter electrode. The main issues that prohibit the commercial application of PSCs are their instability and high fabrication cost. A simple way to cut down the fabrication cost is the development of HTM-free perovskite solar cells due to the ambipolar charge transfer properties of the methylammonium lead iodide perovskite.15–17 Etgar et al. fabricated the first heterojunction FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Au cell, achieving an initial PCE of 5.5%.18 They improved the PCE to 8.1% using a 300 nm mesoporous TiO2 film and tuning the perovskite layer19 and then to 10.85% using a two-step deposition technique.20 The elimination of unstable organic HTM can also remarkably increase the stability of PSCs. Furthermore, noble metal counter electrodes can be replaced by earth-abundant, low-cost, and chemically stable carbon materials.21–26 These facts have stimulated us to explore 3DHG as the counter electrode for HTM-free PSCs. To fabricate the device of HTM-free perovskite solar cells, 3DHG was coated on a CH3NH3PbI3 layer as a counter electrode with the doctor-blade method. To improve the interface, the 3DHG was introduced into the solution of perovskite precursors, followed by the in situ synthesis of the perovskite layer. As a result, a transition layer, in which part of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite molecules were highly dispersed on 3DHG, was formed between the perovskite layer and the 3DHG counter electrode. Fig. 4a shows the configuration (HTM-free TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/3DHG//3DHG) of fabricated perovskite solar cells, in which the HTM layer was eliminated and the novel metal electrode was replaced by 3DHG. Fig. 4b shows the current density (I)–voltage (V) characteristics of HTM-free 3DHG-based PSCs. The short circuit photocurrent (Isc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (ff), and power conversion efficiency (η) of the 3DHG-12-based cell are 17.79 mA cm−2, 0.87 V, 0.50, and 7.71%, respectively. When the synthesizing time increased to 48 h, the power conversion efficiency (η) increased to 10.06% with enhanced Isc (18.11 mA cm−2), Voc (0.89 V), and ff (0.63) (Table 2). This happened probably because the increase in the synthesis time of 3DHG enhanced its electrical conductivity. It is well known that some perovskite solar cells suffer from an issue that a photocurrent hysteresis occurs at a certain voltage scanning rate and scan direction. This issue is usually caused by either charge traps in low quality perovskite films or the ferroelectric properties of the perovskite materials and/or the electromigration of ions in perovskites.27–29 However, such a hysteresis was not observed for the perovskite solar cell with the 3DHG counter electrode (Fig. 5a and Table 3). The excellent performance of the 3DHG-based perovskite solar cells was further supported by the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE). As shown in Fig. 5b, one can see the IPCE curve with a strong spectral response in the range from 350 to 750 nm. The integrated current from the IPCE curve is very close to the Isc obtained from the I–V curve. EIS measurements were carried out in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz with 10 mV AC amplitude under dark conditions. Fig. 5c depicts the Nyquist plot of the solar cell with 3DHG CEs at a forward bias of 900 mV. The first semi-circle in the high frequency region is assigned to the charge exchange process at the perovskite/CE interface, while the one at low frequencies represents the TiO2/perovskite interface. The negative capacitance appears in the low frequency region corresponding to an additional recombination pathway at a high forward bias at one of the interfaces. The 3DHG-48 based PSC shows the smallest radius of the semicircle in the high frequency region (Fig. S5b†), which indicates the lowest charge transfer resistance at the CH3NH3PbI3/carbon interface.30,31 Capacitance–voltage (Cap–V) analysis was further conducted to evaluate the depletion region in the cell. The corresponding Mott–Schottky curves are displayed in Fig. 5d. According to the junction capacitance, the built-in potential was extrapolated using the intercept of the linear regime with the x-axis of the Mott–Schottky plot and equal to 0.98 V, which is consistent with the Voc of the photovoltaic device. The presence of a built-in field can efficiently force the separation of photogenerated carriers and suppress the back reaction of electrons from the TiO2 film to the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. Finally, the excellent preparation-reproducibility of cells was demonstrated by the histogram of efficiencies for 10 cells (Fig. S4†).

Conclusions
In summary, a reaction between K and CO2 was invented to synthesize 3D honeycomb-structured graphene, which possesses high conductivity. Furthermore, the 3D honeycomb-structured graphene exhibited excellent performance as a counter electrode for HTM-free perovskite solar cells, leading to the high power conversion efficiency of 10.06%. This novel 3D graphene can also be applied for batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors, which will be reported in our future papers. Therefore, this work provided a new aspect of potassium chemistry for CO2 conversion and created excellent electrode materials for energy devices.
