    , Accepted 18th September 2022First published on 6th October 2022AbstractThe design and development of diverse functional systems in recent years have achieved a plethora of landmarks in the two cornerstones of supramolecular chemistry, i.e., molecular recognition and self-assembly. Among the various supramolecular entities, the non-aromatic macrocyclic skeleton calix[4]pyrrole (C4P) has been employed for a wide range of potential applications in ion/ion-pair or neutral molecule binding/sensing, polymers, catalysis, drug delivery, pharmacology, ion transport, molecular machines/switches, adsorption, etc. According to the literature, there are numerous reports on functionalized C4P-based architectures, demonstrating the various applications of C4P in diverse fields, which urgently need to be catalogued to provide a guide for researchers working in this wonderful field. Hence, herein, our aim is to compile all the recent advancements in C4P-based supramolecular systems. We believe that this updated version about the emerging C4P chemistry will be very useful to readers in the supramolecular community and will surely unveil the hidden prospects related to this simple but effective supramolecular receptor.
1. Introduction
Considering the involvement of numerous natural receptors in regulating the intricate phenomena in nature through non-covalent interactions, the science of supramolecular chemistry took birth, imitating the basic design and functions of natural receptors for the construction of artificial functional receptors realizing particular goals.1–8 Among the numerous supramolecular receptors,9,10 the non-aromatic tetrapyrrolic synthetic macrocyclic receptor (C4P) has emerged as significant receptor and ligand for diverse purposes owing to its structural variety, easy one-pot synthesis, and recognition ability towards anions, ion-pairs, neutral molecules, and metal ions of fundamental importance.11–23 Adolf von Baeyer (1835–1917, a German Chemist, Noble Prize in Chemistry, 1905) is credited for the discovery of the parent C4P in 1886 through the acid-mediated condensation of pyrrole with acetone in a single step (Fig. 1).24 However, it was the Sessler's team who rediscovered it and extensively investigated its anion-binding features together with the stability of its four probable conformations (Fig. 1).25 Notably, in the presence of anionic species in the solution phase, theoretical and X-ray analysis revealed the self-organization of the 1,3-alternate conformation into a cone conformation because of the extra stability gained through the four NH-hydrogen bonding attractions between the pyrrolic NH-groups and their anionic counterpart.5 Remarkably, flipping the conformation of C4P from one form to another has vastly impacted the development and applications of a myriad of functionalized C4P-based materials for a plethora of general uses and designing versatile stimuli-responsive supramolecular architectures through the self-assembly phenomenon in particular.26,27 To fine-tune the affinity and selectivity of simple C4Ps towards various guest molecules, researchers globally have functionalized the β- and/or meso-positions of the basic C4P skeleton. This has led to the generation of aryl/superaryl extended C4Ps (appending aromatic moieties directly at the meso-positions), strapped C4Ps (bridging two distal meso-positions),28 bis-C4Ps (linking two C4Ps via meso-positions),29 and capped C4Ps (bridging four distal meso-positions diagonally), besides various other vital β- and meso-substituted C4P architectures, respectively (Fig. 1).30–35

Considering the importance of these systems in a wide range of research fields and our major research programme to develop green synthetic protocols for various organic and supramolecular functional systems,36–43 recently, our group also reported a simple and green approach for the preparation of diverse C4Ps in the presence of deep eutectic solvents (DES) of N,N′-dimethyl urea and L-(+)-tartaric acid.44 Furthermore, recently, Wang and co-workers assembled various simple and functionalized C4P structures utilizing the chalcogen bonding (Se⋯O)-catalytic approach.45 Conversely, from a biological viewpoint, besides acting as handy ion-transporters across the lipid bilayer membrane to treat defective ion channels,46–48 C4P-based systems serve as drug carriers for the targeted defective tissues of the body, and also participate in pharmaceutical treatments in combating deadly diseases.49,50 Moreover, these functional materials have also been exploited in the field of sensing for a wide range of anions, metal ions, and neutral molecules,51–55 polymers,56 catalysis,57,58 polymorphism,59 molecular machines,60,61 molecular switches,62–65 molecular probes,66 metal ion coordination cages,67 organic solar cells,68 hydrogen sorption,69 and adsorption of pollutants.70,71 Additionally, they have also been utilized in the fabrication of stimuli-responsive materials, exhibiting enhanced non-linear optical/electronic properties, as revealed by theoretical and experimental studies.72,73 Recently, C4P has made its entry into the formation of host–guest complexes with thallium salts such as thallium fluoride (TlF) in the solid state as well as in the solution and gaseous phase. The resultant ion-pair complexes of C4P with thallium salts promote the self-assembly and construction of fibrous supramolecular aggregates of higher order.74
Obviously, there are several review articles available in the literature related to C4P systems, highlighting their diverse potential applications. However, to the best knowledge of our, in the past three years, no comprehensive update has been reported related to the chemistry of C4P, although plentiful exciting results are being published in reputed journals. Hence, herein, we aim to critically evaluate all the vital developments made in this emerging field in the past three years. Notably, in the present account, besides highlighting the recent advancements of functionalized C4Ps in host–guest chemistry and molecular self-assembly, we also emphasize the newly developed research field of catalysis involving structurally constrained p-block C4P planar systems as versatile catalysts for carrying out diverse important transformations. We believe that this updated version about the novel applications of C4P-based functional systems will be very useful to readers not only in the supramolecular and organic community but also researchers working in biological and materials sciences. Moreover, the catalysis research fraternity will undoubtedly benefit from this particular manuscript, revealing the hidden prospects related to this simple but effective supramolecular candidate.
2. Functional C4Ps as versatile receptors
The design and construction of strapped C4P-based anionic receptors are considered a vibrant research topic in the field of supramolecular chemistry.28 It has been observed that the binding features of strapped C4Ps depend mostly on the nature and length of a particular strap. In this regard, He, Sessler, and Kim's research group reported the preparation of phenanthroline-based strapped C4Ps (7 and 8, Fig. 2) for the enhanced affinity and selective recognition of the HCO3− anion (used as sodium/tetraethylammonium (TEA+) salt) in the presence of other competing anions (F−, Cl−, Br−, I−, H2PO4−, HSO4−, SO42−, etc. as TBA+ salts).751H-NMR titrations performed in CDCl3/15% D2O-DMSO-d6 ensured higher HCO3− binding for receptor 8 (Ka = 4880 M−1), consisting of an amide linkage in its framework in comparison to receptor 7 (Ka = 1330 M−1), holding two ester groups. Receptor 8 binds the HCO3− ion by means of six NH-hydrogen bond donors, generating anion-receptor complex 9−, as revealed by 1H-NMR titration experiments and DFT studies. Surprisingly, owing to the competing intramolecular H-bonding interactions in CDCl3, although receptor 8 possessed additional H-bonding donor sites (e.g., amide NH groups), it displayed lower affinity towards various other tested anions in sharp contrast to the analogous receptor 7. However, due to the weakening of intramolecular H-bonding contacts in 15% D2O-DMSO-d6, elevated anion binding affinity was noticed in the case of receptor 8 for other tested anions besides HCO3−. Thus, a change in solvent polarity reverses the anion affinity/selectivity, and hence underscores the significance of the solvent in modulating the anion binding signatures of the anionic receptors.

Alternatively, Heo et al. reported the use of two rigid strapped C4P-based receptors (10 and 11) for the selective recognition of HCO3− (trigonal planar) and F− (spherical) anions in the presence of several other assessed anions via the displacement approach (Fig. 3).76 In the case of the anions, i.e., HCO3− and F−, 1H-NMR spectroscopy revealed the higher preference of 10 for HCO3− (as TEA+ salt, Ka = 2300 M−1) in comparison to the F− ion (as TBA+ salt, Ka = 910 M−1). Upon the addition of TBAF, complete displacement of the bound HCO3− anion from receptor 10 in the form of TBAHCO3 was observed because of the fact that the TEAHCO3 receptor complex (12−) has superior affinity and selectivity towards the F− ion (Ka = 5450 M−1, Fig. 3). Subsequently, the formation of the stable TEAF receptor complex (13−) occurs through anion metathesis inside the cavities of the receptors (Fig. 3). Similar findings were also observed in case of receptor 11 by this research group. These studies support the notion of ion-pair receptor complexation through the interactions participating inside and outside the C4P network.

In another report, the research team of Wezenberg installed a photo-switchable stiff-stilbene moiety as a strap to construct a photo-switchable strapped C4P-based chloride ion receptor (20), commencing from an easily accessible starting material, namely 6-carboxy-1-indanone (14), as detailed in Scheme 1.77 The 1H-NMR, UV-Vis and ITC studies carried out in acetonitrile and DMSO solvents confirmed that the strapped C4P-based receptor (20) in its Z-isomeric form exhibited strong binding affinity (Ka = 1.6 × 105 M−1) towards the chloride anion, as the tetrabutylammonium (TBA) salt, thereby constructing an anion-receptor complex (21−). However, the photo-switching of 21− from the Z-form into the E-isomeric form through irradiation at 365 nm developed strain in the stiff-stilbene strap, and hence drastically reduced the binding affinity of 20 towards a chloride anion (Ka = 2.0 × 102 M−1), as revealed by 1H-NMR titrations (Scheme 1). Thus, these crucial examinations demonstrate that the photo-switchable strapped C4P exhibits highly effective and controlled chloride anion binding and also confirm the release of anions through irradiation at a particular wavelength, which may prove useful in various extraction and transmembrane ion transport processes in future investigations.

To advance crown ether-based C4P systems, Schatz, Page and Sessler's research group constructed two unprecedented crown-ether-containing strapped C4Ps (25 and 26), differing in the linkage of the strap to the meso-positions of the C4P framework, starting from dipyrromethane (DPM, 22) (Scheme 2).78 Competitive binding studies with different anionic salts were carried out via1H-NMR spectroscopy, revealing that 25 and 26 are highly selective hosts for LiCl amongst various other likely salts, for example, KCl, NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2. Interestingly, single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed that the functionalized crown ether moieties in both macrocyclic receptors assist in binding the cationic component (Li+) of LiCl, whereas the four pyrrolic NH-groups of the C4P scaffold capture the anionic component (Cl−) of the LiCl salt via NH-hydrogen bonding forces (Scheme 2). Thus, both crown-ether strapped C4Ps act as ion-pair receptors. The authors further modified both 25 and 26via copolymerization with acrylate monomer and other cross linkers to fabricate organogels. Interestingly, these organogels selectively adsorbed LiCl in acetonitrile solution, and subsequently released the adsorbed LiCl in methanol solvent. Consequently, the fabricated organogels could be recycled and reused for the selective adsorption of LiCl. Thus, these studies offer a promising approach for selective LiCl separation and recycling upon switching the solvent polarity.

To further explore the crown ether strapped C4P architectures, Jang and teammates fabricated a triazole-based strapped C4P (30) through a click reaction as the crucial step (Scheme 3).79 The detailed synthetic route for the construction of 30 is clearly depicted in Scheme 3. According to the 1H-NMR studies, it was observed that the strapped C4P (30) acts as a selective ion-pair receptor towards lithium salts (LiCl and LiBr). Interestingly, the 1H-NMR and X-ray studies revealed that 30 binds LiCl through separated ion-pair geometry aided by three molecules of water (Scheme 3). Besides, liquid–liquid extraction experiments were performed to transfer LiCl and LiBr from the aqueous phase to the organic phase via ion-pair binding with a macrocyclic receptor (30). Later, upon treatment with CO2/K2CO3, the extracted lithium salts were solidified in the form of Li2CO3.

Owing to the significant role of the sulfate anion (SO42−) in various environmental and biological processes, its selective recognition through diverse macrocyclic receptors has attracted significant attention from researchers worldwide.80 In this regard, He et al. synthesized a neutral benzene bistriazole-based strapped C4P (34) starting from the commercially available 6-chlorohexan-2-one 31 (Scheme 4). The binding investigations revealed its high affinity and selectivity towards SO42− (as TBA salt, Ka = 3.18 ± 0.54 × 106 M−1) in the presence of other competing anionic entities (Cl−, Br−, AcO−, NO3−, H2PO4−, etc.) in aqueous solution.81 Importantly, according to the X-ray studies, it was observed by the authors that receptor 34 binds SO42− in a chair-like 3D cavity via cooperative NH-hydrogen bonding and CH–anion interactions. Thus, in future perspectives, these results will pave the way towards the design and construction of neutral anion receptors in aqueous media.

The detection of the bicarbonate anion (HCO3−) with the use of versatile supramolecular receptors has gained widespread interest from the supramolecular community in this growing area of research because of its involvement in regulating the pH homeostasis in a variety of biological and environmental processes. In this context, Kim and co-workers designed and synthesized a naphthobipyrrole-based strapped C4P (35, Fig. 4), exhibiting comparatively higher binding affinity towards HCO3− (Ka = 1170 M−1) than the simple C4P in both the solid-state and solution phases, as revealed by the UV-Vis and 1H-NMR spectroscopic titrations.82 The relatively superior binding affinity with HCO3− is ascribed to the extra NH-hydrogen bonding interactions of the strap with HCO3− in addition to the usual preliminary NH-bonding contacts of the C4P scaffold. Fascinatingly, the 1H-NMR studies carried out in CD2Cl2 revealed two binding modes of receptor (35) with HCO3−. The first involves the interaction of HCO3− with all six NH-hydrogen atoms through H-bonding, leading to the generation of an anion-receptor complex (36−) (Fig. 4). However, upon the supplementary addition of HCO3− ions, deprotonation of one of the NH-groups of the naphthobipyrrole moiety was noticed by the authors, and hence only four pyrrolic NH-hydrogen bonding forces of the C4P assisted in binding the trigonal planar HCO3− ion to yield the anion-receptor complex (37−) (Fig. 4). In the presence of CH3OH, the bound HCO3− ion gets converted to the unstable CH3OCO2− anion, which in turn is stabilized through complex formation with receptor 35.

Basically, N-oxides are promising candidates as pharmaceutical agents and also act as neutral polar guests for various processes.83 Thus, considering the importance of N-oxides, Sessler and other collaborating research groups described the recognition of pyrazine-N,N′-dioxide (45) in the solid state and in solution phase by virtue of 2/4-walled aryl extended-C4Ps (38–42, Fig. 5).84 Single-crystal X-ray studies revealed the partial cone conformation of the receptors (38–40) encapsulating a guest entity (45) in the form of 2:1 host–guest complexes (Fig. 5). Although, receptor 41 also shows 2:1 host–guest complex formation with 45, it exists in the 1,2-alternate conformation. In contrast to 2-walled C4Ps (38–41), the 4-walled aryl extended C4P (42) adopts a cone conformation, and hence accommodates 45 inside the upper rim of the aryl cavity, forming a 1:1 host–guest supramolecular complex (Fig. 5). Thus, these studies offer an auspicious strategy for the fabrication of macrocyclic receptors for various neutral polar guest species.

Alternatively, in a different study, Ballester and Rodriguez attached an Au(I) phosphine moiety to the upper rim of an aryl-extended C4P (43) to fabricate an anionic receptor (44, Fig. 5), and evaluated the influence of Au(I) phosphine on the anion binding affinity.85 Studies revealed that owing to the better fit of the methyl group, both receptors 43 and 44 showed higher binding affinities with methyltrioctylammonium chloride (MTOACl) in comparison to TBACl. According to the UV-vis, ITC, and 1H-NMR titration experiments, it was observed that the C4P-based receptor (44) displayed less attraction towards TBACl than its parent counterpart (43). This is due to the fact that at the centre of the Au(I) phosphine aromatic moiety, there is an increase in the negative value of electrostatic potential, leading to unfavourable repulsive Cl−–π interactions. In another report, Ballester's research group explored the reactivity pattern of a macrocyclic receptor (44) and its congeners, and also investigated its moderate cytotoxic activities on human cancerous cells.86
In another publication, He, Xu, and Sessler's research groups reported the smallest bis-C4P (48) (Scheme 5), and also revealed its selective fluoride (used as TBA salt) binding affinity in the presence of various other competing anions with different geometries such as Cl−, Br−, H2PO4−, NO3−, SO42−, HP2O73−, and SCN−via1H-NMR titrations.87,88 The selective inclusion of the F− ion in bis-C4P (48) is attributed to its small cavity size. Further, the X-ray crystal studies have revealed the formation of a 1:2 host guest complex between host 48 and the F− ion, as the TBA salt (Scheme 5). These outcomes offer a promising approach for the design and construction of functional macrocyclic receptors exhibiting high/exclusive selectivity towards guest entities of significant interest. Fascinatingly, Namor and group introduced N,N′-diethylthioamide functional groups on the three nitrogen atoms out of four of the parent C4P (1) to obtain the asymmetric C4P-based system 49, which was found to bind solely with the Ag(I) ion, as revealed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 5).56 Interestingly, the addition of Hg(NO3)2 to the asymmetric receptor 49 resulted in its decomposition, as confirmed by FTIR, 1H-NMR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These studies offer potential applications in the monitoring of Ag(I) ions through their sequestration from aqueous media, and also a promising strategy for the fabrication of Ag(I) ion selective electrodes. Alternatively, Nowik-Zajac et al. has reported selective Ag(I) ion transport in nitrate aqueous solutions via a polymer inclusion membrane possessing an ester-functionalized C4P (50).46

3. C4P-based systems as sensors
In the field of anion/neutral molecule sensing, simple and β-/meso-substituted C4Ps by means of their various spectroscopic signatures and sensing tactics have shown considerable potential in the past two decades.89,90 In the case of C4P-based sensors, researchers have mostly used the competitive sensing approach, known as the indicator displacement assay (IDA), for the sensing of analytes of particular interest.91–93 By employing colorimetric and/or fluorometric indicators, the sensing events of various analytes have been recorded either through a colorimetric or turn ON/OFF fluorescence response.94,95 In this regard, Ayodgan's research team reported the selective and sensitive sensing potential of a simple C4P (1) towards F− ions by means of a fluorescence indicator displacement assay (F-IDA) involving the use of 4-methylumbelliferone (51, as TBA salt) and fluorescein (52 and 53, as TBA salts) as fluorescent indicators (Fig. 6).96 Fluorescence quenching was observed upon the binding of these fluorescent indicators (51–53) with the receptor (1). The subsequent addition of F− ions resulted in the displacement of these fluorescent indicators (51–53) because of their greater binding power with 1, thereby offering a turn-ON fluorescence response (Fig. 6). Additionally, it was obsereved that the F-IDA sensor (57) consisting of a bis-TBA fluorescein salt and C4P (1) sensed F− ions with an LOD value of 3.2 nm. Considering the ease of synthesis of C4P (1), these studies present inexpensive C4P-based selective and sensitive fluorescent sensors for the clear detection of the F− ion.

Considering the concerns of national health security, the detection of nitroaromatic explosive compounds (NACs) by means of supramolecular sensors is gaining significant attention from the research community globally. Accordingly, Kim, Sessler, Park, and co-workers reported a ratiometric F-IDA for the selective detection of a variety of NACs such as trinitrotoluene, trinitrophenol, and trinitrobenzene.97 In their studies, they exploited the sensing potential of a benzo-tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)-functionalized C4P (69) for the above-mentioned NACs with the aid of fluorescent indicators, i.e., naphthalenediimides (NDIs, 59 and 60), perylenediimides (PDIs, 61 and 62) and PF6−/Cl− rhodamine 6G salts (Rh-6G, 63) (Fig. 7). Interestingly, fluorescence quenching (turn-OFF fluorescence response) was observed upon the addition of NDI fluorophores (59 and 60) to the macrocyclic receptor (58). Alternatively, a surprising fluorescence enhancement (turn-ON fluorescence response) was observed upon the introduction of 58 to the PDI fluorophores (61 and 62). The subsequent exposure of above-mentioned competitive NACs to the indicator-receptor complexes led to the displacement of the fluorescent indicators owing to the greater binding affinity of the NACs with 58. This displacement of the various fluorescent indicators offered either turn-ON or turn-OFF responses, which are dependent both on the nature of the fluorophore and the counter ion (Fig. 7).

Also, a diagrammatic depiction of ratiometric F-IDA for the recognition of NACs by 58 is displayed. (Reprinted with permission from ref. 97 Copyright 2020, the American Chemical Society.) 
Recently, in another study, Desai et al. constructed extraordinary C4P-based sensors (64 and 65) bearing carboxylic acid and anthraquinone moieties at the meso-positions of the C4P framework (Fig. 7).98 According to the experimental studies, they evaluated the sensing potential of 64 towards NACs such as dinitrotoluene (DNT), 4-nitrobenzyl bromide, and 4-nitrotoluene. Receptor 65 acted as a fluorescent sensor, which selectively sensed the Sr2+ metal ion in the presence of various other competing metal ions such as Mg2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Cr3+, and Al3+.
Recently, our research group fabricated a phenylboronic acid-based meso-substituted one-walled C4P (66, Fig. 8) and evaluated its electrochemical sensing potential towards the highly sensitive detection of analytes, namely, dopamine and catechol.99 By means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), it was ensured that one-walled C4P (66) functions as a highly sensitive electrochemical sensor for both dopamine and catechol (Fig. 8). According to the DPV calibration plots, the LOD value for dopamine was found to be 15 nM, while that for catechol was 13 nM in the lower concentration region and 18 nM in the higher concentration region. The authors suggested that the introduction of the boronic acid functionality in the C4P skeleton and its exploitation may offer valuable insights for the detection of various other valuable analytes. Notably, studies on the selective sensing of other neurotransmitters in addition to the sensing of carbohydrate-based analytes are underway by our research group, which will be published in due course.

On another occasion, Ballester and Pischel's research group constructed C4P-based cavitands (67 and 68) for the detection of the well-known clinical indicator and metabolic waste ingredient creatinine (69) and its analogue, i.e., hexylcreatinine (70).100 To accomplish the desired goal, F-IDA was employed with the help of the fluorescent indicator dye 72 and a black hole quencher (71) (Fig. 9).101 The dansyl chromophore was linked to cavitand 67 to construct cavitand 68, and 71 was used as the indicator. Interestingly, in the indicator-receptor complex (71@68), FRET was observed from 68 to the dansyl chromophore, resulting in fluorescence quenching. However, fluorescence recovery was observed upon the displacement of 71 from 71@68 by virtue of analyte 69/70, possessing higher binding affinity with 68 (Fig. 9). Moreover, in the indicator-receptor complex (72@67), the observed fluorescence response was very low, while the subsequent displacement of 72 from 72@67 by 69/70 resulted in a fluorescence enhancement (Fig. 9). In another experiment, Li and co-workers fabricated polymeric membrane electrodes with ionophores composed of bis/tetraphosphonate C4P-based cavitands (73oo, 73oi, 73ii, 74oooo, and 74oooi; i = in and o = out) differing in the relative orientation of the PO groups (Fig. 10).102 These fabricated polymeric membrane electrodes acted as potentiometric sensors and displayed high selectivity towards acetylcholine. According to the potentiometric calibration plots, they observed an LOD value of 3 × 10−7 M for acetylcholine.

The common use of C4Ps for the recognition/sensing/selective biomembrane transport of amino acids (AAs) was overlooked until recently. The research groups of Ballester and Palacin extracted some novel findings related to the involvement of C4P-based cavitands in the recognition, sensing, and selective transport of AAs across liposomal membranes and living cells.103 It was revealed that the deep C4P-based cavitand (67, Fig. 9) selectively forms a 1:1 host–guest complex with L-proline in the presence of various competing AAs, and hence functions as an effective carrier towards the facilitated diffusion of L-proline across liposomal membranes. In the context of sensing AAs such as L-proline (76), L-pipecolic acid (77), and L-phenylalanine (78), Ballester and coworkers, for the first time, constructed C4P-based fluorescent cavitands (75i and 75o) containing an N-phenyl naphthylamine-based fluorophore and varying in spatial orientation of the phosphonate moiety (Fig. 11).104 To sense AAs (76 and 77), direct FRET-based IDA sensing and binding-based sensing (BBS) assays were performed, thereby revealing the greater selectivity of 76 with cavitand 75i compared to cavitand 75o. Small alterations in their emission were observed through BBS once 76/77 bind with cavitand 75i. These results are contrary to the large variations in the emission produced when these AAs (76/77) bind to cavitand 75o. Thus, to overcome these limitations, a FRET-based IDA was used, which resulted in a turn-ON fluorescence response upon swapping the phenyl N-oxide quencher (71) from 1:1 sensing ensembles (75i@71 and 75o@71) by AAs (76–78) (Fig. 11). These studies present a potential strategy for the preliminary diagnosis of particular ailments occurring due to deficient/elevated levels of AAs.

Kongor et al. fabricated gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) with tetrahydrazide-functionalized C4P (80) for the naked-eye selective colorimetric detection and potential electrochemical sensing of As(III) in the aqueous phase (Fig. 12).105 It was revealed that the selective binding of As(III) with 80 among various other competing anions (Cl−, NO3−, SO42−, and PO43−) on the surface of Au-NPs resulted in a visible color change from pink to blue, and also a red shift in the absorbance, as revealed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The aggregation of the C4P (80)-fabricated Au-NPs upon the colorimetric sensing of As(III) is owing to the existence of non-covalent interactions between C4P (80) and As(III) (Fig. 12). Additionally, by virtue of these functionalized C4P (80)-fabricated Au-NPs, an LOD of 1 ppb for As(III) was observed through electrochemical sensing by these authors. Recently, Desai et al. constructed two aryl-extended C4P-based sensors (81 and 82, Fig. 12) bearing quinoline and anthraquinone moieties for the selective and sensitive sensing of the well-known antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) and Hg2+ metal ion, among various other tested antibiotics (e.g., kanamycin, ciprofloxacin, and neomycin) and metal ions (e.g., Zn2+, Mg2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+), respectively.106 On the one hand, sensor 81 displayed selective and sensitive sensing for OTC with an LOD of 100 μM. On the other hand, sensor 82 exhibited strong complexing ability with Hg2+ metal ions, as shown by the absorption and emission spectral data.

4. Polymeric materials holding C4P scaffold
In the past few years, C4Ps act as frontline contenders for the generation of supramolecular polymers.107 In this context, Aydogan and teammates constructed a supramolecular linear polymer from a ureidopyrimidinone-functionalized C4P (83) via orthogonal self-assembly assisted by the quadrupole H-bonding and anion recognition host–guest interactions between 83 and tetrabutylammonium suberate (TBAS) (Fig. 13). The fabricated supramolecular linear polymer was responsive to thermal and chemical stimuli.108 In another study, Rifai, and co-workers utilized a phenoxy C4P-based cross-linked polymer (84) for the extraction of radium from the aqueaous phase with the help of the Doehlert experimental setup developed by David H. Doehlert in 1970.109,110

In the context of wastewater treatment, i.e., removal of micropollutants from water by means of C4P-based supramolecular adsorbents, Wang, Sessler, and teammates reported three unprecedented C4P-cross-linked 3D-porous organic polymers (85–87, Fig. 14).111 In their adsorption studies, they tested diverse organic pollutants with different charges, functionality and hydrophilicity including cationic pesticides, simple aromatic compounds, and dyes. Interestingly, polymer 87 was found to be a highly effective adsorbent for cationic micropollutants with an adsorption capacity of 454 mg g−1 for methylene blue (88), 495 mg g−1 for diquat pesticide (89), and 344 mg g−1 for paraquat pesticide (90), as revealed by the Langmuir isotherms (Fig. 14). Besides the porous polymeric networks (85–87), these workers also constructed C4P-cross-linked porous polymeric networks (91–95, Fig. 14) for the effective sequestration of iodine from wastewater with an adsorption capacity of up to 3.38 g g−1.112 The high adsorption capacity of iodine from water is due to the presence of a large number of adsorption sites in the C4P subunits and pores due to their polymerization. Thus, these outcomes show the great potential of C4Ps for water purification and broaden their horizon as supramolecular adsorbents.

Liu and Fang's research teams fabricated C4P-based nanofilms at the air-DMSO interface through the acyl-hydrazone reaction between a self-assembled layer of a C4P-tetrahydrzide (CPTH, 96) and aldehyde 97 (Fig. 15).113 The resultant nanofilms were found to be robust, thermally stable, defect free, regenerable, and tolerate a wide pH-range and diverse organic solvents, besides displaying antifouling features. It was observed that the C4P unit in these nanofilms exhibited noteworthy mechanical and separation properties, and hence can play an important role in wastewater treatment. In another study, Fang and teammates also reported robust and defect-free C4P-based nanofilms via dynamic condensation between C4P-tetrahydrzide (98) and aldehyde 97 at the air-DMSO interface (Fig. 15).114 It was observed that the treatment of these nanofilms with CsF significantly enhanced their hydrophilicity, leading to an increase in their performance towards molecular sieving in both aqueous and organic phases. Interestingly, the C4P-fabricated nanofilms provided blocking efficiency for diverse small functional molecules and the inbuilt C4P unit enhanced their separation capacity significantly for organic dyes and AAs.

Utilizing the anion recognition ability of C4P-based systems, Aydogan's research group constructed two 3A-type C4P-based supramolecular monomers (99 and 100, Fig. 16). Later, by means of the self-assembly phenomenon, they were complexed with TBAS in CH3CN/CHCl3 to fabricate supramolecular polymeric networks assisted by the H-bonding interactions between the C4P and carboxylate units of TBAS, as revealed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy.115 Intriguingly, these anion-recognition-assisted polymeric networks were found to be responsive towards temperature, pH, and competing anions, as confirmed by viscosity and 1H-NMR experiments. According to the rheological studies, it was found that the polymeric network system developed from 99 and TBAS had no self-healing properties, whereas the polymeric network developed from 100 and TBAS possessed a longer distance between the C4P units and benzene core, displaying self-healing behavior below 20% deformation, and also transient network behaviour. Additionally, by means of various fabrication methods, the developed supramolecular polymeric network systems were also employed in the construction of hierarchical materials such as spherical aggregates, porous 2D materials, fibers, and 3D glues (Fig. 16). Recently, the same group also fabricated hyperbranched an AB2-type C4P-based supramolecular polymer (102) from an AB2-type monomeric C4P unit (101) via the anion recognition capability of the C4P system (Fig. 16).116 The resulting hyperbranched supramolecular polymer (102) was responsive towards thermal, chemical, and pH stimuli. However, it exhibited no response towards competitive F− ions due to its high stiffness. Besides, the morphology of the hyperbranched polymer (102) could be tuned by means of the concentration of the monomeric C4P unit (101). At a lower concentration of 101, ellipsoidal aggregates were obtained via the self-assembly phenomenon, whereas at a higher concentration of 101, branched, cubic and higher-order aggregates of crystalline nature were fruitfully noticed (Fig. 16).

5. Metal ion caged systems based on C4P
To construct metal coordination cages, aqueous or organic phase-driven self-assembly is being regarded as an efficient approach. Guest inclusion in these coordination cages not only offers selectivity in molecular recognition but also governs the properties, reactivities, and release of the molecular cargo in a controlled manner.117,118 In this regard, Ballester and co-workers constructed superaryl-extended C4Ps (103–105) and revealed the formation of a 1:1 host–guest complex of 103 with 1 equiv. of pyridine-N-oxide (106) in a 2:1 solution mixture of CDCl3/CD3CN.119,120 Consequently, upon the addition of 1 equiv. of [Pd(MeCN)4](BF4)2 to the 1:1 host–guest complex solution, the self-assembled metal coordination cage [103·Pd]2+, featuring two polar binding sites, was formed via PdII coordination with the pyridyl units of 103 (Fig. 17). Importantly, the authors also divulged the formation of the Pd(II) cage system [104·Pd]6+via the self-assembly of the tetra cationic superaryl extended C4P (104) with [Pd(MeCN)4](BF4)2.120 Furthermore, [104·Pd]6+ is water soluble and possesses two polar binding sites endohedrally. For efficient self-assembly, the inclusion of mono/ditopic pyridyl N-oxides (106–108) and aliphatic formamide guests (109–111) was found to be necessary (Fig. 17). On the one hand, the cage cavity of the [104·Pd]6+ was found to be partially filled by the monotopic pyridyl N-oxide guest molecule (106); and therefore required the co-inclusion of a water molecule. On the other hand, the ditopic pyridyl N-oxide guests (107 and 108) entirely filled the [104·Pd]6+ cage cavity, assisted by non-covalent supramolecular interactions of both the available polar binding sites of the cage. Additionally, these authors also investigated the uptake and release of polar guest species in [104·Pd]6+ by means of competition experiments, and also suggested that the guest exchange process is governed by the “French door” mechanism.

Also, the single-crystal X-ray structure of the self-assembled metal coordination cage [103·Pd]2+ capturing CH3CN as a solvent molecule and monotopic pyridyl N-oxide (106) as a guest is shown.

In another study, the same group reported the synthesis of an unprecedented oxazolopyrazinyl unit-based superaryl-extended C4P (112, Fig. 18), and also revealed its inclusion complexes with guest species (106, 107, 110, and 111, Fig. 17) in the presence of solvents such as CH2Cl2 and CH3CN.67 These inclusion complexes were found to form Pd(II)/Pt(II) metal coordination cage systems, i.e., [112@Pd2(dppp)2](OTf)4 and [112@Pt2(dppp)2](OTf)4 upon treatment with two equiv. of corresponding metal salts [Pd(dppp)(OTf)2] and [Pt(dppp)(OTf)2], respectively (Fig. 18). It was observed that the metal corners in these cage systems arrange the axial phenyl units near the aromatic walls of C4P (112), and thus the inclusion complexes were observed to form a single conformer. In addition, they observed fast exchange of the guest molecules via competition experiments without any dissociation of the metal ligand bonds.

6. Structurally constrained p-block C4P-compounds in catalysis
In the context of carrying out controlled organic transformations via C4P catalysis, Ballester and co-workers reported the preparation of an octapyridinium-based water soluble superaryl-extended C4P (113), and by means of host–guest complexation, they investigated its catalytic potential in the controlled hydrolysis of symmetrical bis-isonitriles (114) to unsymmetrical monoformamides (115) (Fig. 19).57 Among the various symmetrical bis-isonitrile-based guest entities (114), the bis-isonitrile guest molecule containing five methylene (CH2) groups was found to be more susceptible to the selective hydrolysis of one of its terminal isonitrile functional groups to a monoformamide group. This reflects that the rate of hydrolysis is slower for symmetrical bis-isonitriles in the bound form with 113 compared to that in the bulk solution. These studies thus offer a new catalytic route for vital synthetic transformations of fundamental interest.

Over the last two decades, the coordination chemistry of tetrapyrrolato C4P ligands with diverse metal ions has progressed by virtue of the ability of C4Ps to form σ/π-complexes, offering a new catalytic pathway for various synthetic conversions.121–125 In this direction, Greb and teammates revealed the reversible OH-bond activation of primary/secondary/tertiary alcohols (118–123) under reduced pressure by means of a calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate-based catalyst (116, Fig. 20).126 The resultant products besides displaying amphoterism through metal–ligand cooperativity, also enable substitution reactions at their metal centre. Remarkably, the Al-metal centre adopts an anti van't-Hoff-Le-Bel square planar configuration and the reversible dearomatization/aromatization of the pyrrole ring occurs during the catalytic transformation (Fig. 20). Prior to this work, the same group also observed the dearomatization of the pyrrole unit of 116 upon undergoing interaction with carbonyl compounds (124–126), thereby leading to the construction of Al–O and C–C bonds (127) via metal–ligand cooperativity (Fig. 20).127 It was observed that catalyst 116 offered high rates towards the capture/release of carbonyl substrates (124–126) and the products (127) showed full reversibility. Alternatively, they investigated the behaviour of catalyst 116 in the activation of triplet dioxygen, and fascinatingly revealed the selective formation of peroxides (128) (Fig. 20). Although these peroxides displayed stability towards several external substrates, they cleanly underwent oxidative α-cleavage in the pyrrole through the aromatization–dearomatization of 116 (Fig. 20).128 To further explore 116, they also noticed its potential catalytic role in the dehydropolymerization process of phenylphosphine boranes (130) to high molecular weight polyphosphino boranes (131, Fig. 20).129 Strikingly, it was proposed that the dehydrocoupling of 130via the p-block metal ion (AlIII)-inserted ligand/catalyst 116 offers the resultant polymers (131) with higher purity than that obtained via d-block metal ion-inserted catalysts, where residual metal ion impurities remain in the resultant polymeric materials.

In another study, the same group reported the preparation of an unprecedented calix[4]pyrrolato Sn(II) ligand (132) and investigated its catalytic efficiency/reactivity as a nucleophile. It was observed that 132 reacts with chloro derivatives (133 and 134) and acyl chloride (135) to yield 136. Besides, 132 also reacts with aldehydes (137 and 138) through hydride substitution to furnish acyl stannates (139) as valuable precursors (Fig. 21).130 Interestingly, in case of iodobenzene, 132 plays a catalytic role in the reductive dehalogenation to benzene assisted by means of halogen-bonding interaction. On another occasion, they also reported the synthesis of a calix[4]pyrrolato Sb(III) ligand (141) and calix[4]pyrrolato Sb(V) ligand (142) and revealed the Lewis superacidity of 142via the electromerism between the Sb(III) oxidation state of the redox-active ligand 141 and Sb(V) oxidation state of the redox-active ligand 142 (Fig. 21).131 In fact, the coordination of a Lewis base to 141 led to non-innocent coupled redox electron transfer and triggered a change in the oxidation state from Sb(III) of 141 to Sb(V) of 142 (Fig. 21). These studies may pave the way towards various synthetic transformations operating through Lewis acid catalysis.

Also, the Lewis superacidity of the calix[4]pyrrolato Sb(V) ligand (142) via electromerism between ligand 141 and ligand 142 is depicted. 
7. Conclusions and future perspectives
In the present report, we summarized the achievements related to C4P-based supramolecular entities from the last two and a half years, with focus on their applications as receptors, sensors, polymers, metal-ion caged systems, and catalysts. In recent years, functionalized C4Ps have been explored for the molecular recognition of zwitterionic amino acids and their transport across biomembranes through facilitated diffusion. This holds great promise to make use of these receptors in the treatment of deadly diseases involving elevated/decreased levels of amino acids in the body. Their use in the development of stimuli-responsive supramolecular polymers of biological significance via the orthogonal self-assembly process is also the goal of biologists and chemists working in the field of polymers. The extended use of C4Ps in the construction of aryl/superaryl-extended C4Ps and cavitands has resulted in their exploitation for the development of photo/pH-responsive molecular switches, metal ion caged systems, water-soluble C4Ps, and turn-ON/OFF fluorescent functional materials. Importantly, in 2018, a major research programme of catalysis using C4P-based p-block structurally constrained compounds embarked from the laboratory of Greb's group to carry out vital synthetic transformations. We believe that this emerging area of research is in its infancy and demands exploration at an advanced level in the future. We also believe that the present account, which provides the newly added reports on C4P-based functional systems and their potential applications, will provide guidance for the further exploration of this wonderful supramolecular chemistry discipline.
