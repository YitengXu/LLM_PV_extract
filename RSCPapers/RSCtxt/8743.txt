, Accepted 20th June 2016First published on 22nd June 2016AbstractBi2WO6/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite nanofibers were successfully fabricated by calcining electrospun PVP/RGO/[(NH4)10W12O41 + Bi(NO3)3] composite nanofibers. The products were investigated in detail by X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Furthermore, photoluminescence spectra (PL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the samples were determined to explain the mechanism for the significant enhancement of the photocatalytic performance of the Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers. Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers are pure orthorhombic phase with a space group of B2ab, and the diameter is 132 ± 11 nm. Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers are composed of nanoparticles with the diameter ranging from 30 nm to 50 nm. The Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers used for photocatalytic water splitting exhibit the highest H2 production, which is improved by 5.8 times compared to pure Bi2WO6 nanofibers. This could be ascribed to two points: the one-dimensional Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers constructed by electrospinning technique have a better capability of electron transportation and intimate interfacial contact area between Bi2WO6 and RGO; the addition of RGO gives rise to excellent conductivity which could transfer the photogenerated electrons quickly and inhibit the recombination of electrons and holes. The study provides a new method to prepare photocatalytic material for converting water and solar energy to clean energy.
Introduction
Nowadays, the global energy crisis and environmental pollution demand increasingly severe regulations that open up opportunities for novel green photocatalytic routes. Photocatalytic water splitting is a chemical reaction for producing hydrogen by using two major renewable energy resources, namely, water and solar energy.1,2 Semiconductor photocatalysts have attracted much attention owing to their great potential in energy production and environmental purification.3–5 However, to obtain hydrogen from water under visible light, the ideal band gap of the semiconductor should be around 2.0 eV. Moreover, the position of the conduction band (CB) potential should be more negative than the reduction potential (H+/H2). So far, various semiconductor photocatalysts have been investigated, such as BiVO4,6 Bi2WO6,7 MnCo2O4,8 C3N4,9 TiO2,10 Bi2MoO6,11 ZnO.12 Among them, Bi2WO6 is one of the most efficient photocatalysts owing to its band gap (2.8 eV).13,14
However, the conduction band potential of Bi2WO6 is slightly positive than the reduction potential of H2O, which limits its water splitting performance. In order to improve its photocatalytic activity, many efforts have been made. For instance, doping with suitable (Er3+,15 Ag,16 carbon17,18 and SiO2 (ref. 19)) has been reported to enhance the photocatalytic activity of the Bi2WO6. In addition, reduced graphene oxide (denoted as RGO for short) is an efficient cocatalyst for hydrogen evolution because of its large specific surface area and superior electron mobility and excellent conductivity.20,21 Recently, a large number of fabrication methods have already been employed to fabricate Bi2WO6/RGO nanomaterials and their photocatalytic activity were investigated. Zhang22 and co-workers synthesized a nanostructured Bi2WO6/RGO composites by a low-temperature hydrothermal reduction process using ethanol as a reducing agent. The photocatalytic activities of the composites were evaluated to decompose methylene blue (MB) or rhodamine B (RhB) in comparison with pure Bi2WO6. Sun23 et al. reported a sonochemical method to engineer Bi2WO6 nanoneedles onto RGO sheets, which showed high performance in photocatalytic creation both in H2 (234.83 μmol h−1) and O2 (23.61 μmol h−1) from water. A solvothermal method was developed for fabrication of RGO-grafted hierarchical Bi2WO6 composites by Zhou,24 compared to pristine hierarchical Bi2WO6 micro-spheres, the composites exhibited both a higher photocatalytic removal ratio of NO (59.0%) and better selectivity for the formation of ionic species (93.6%). More recently, an electrostatic self-assembly approach was developed to construct Bi2WO6/RGO nanocomposites by Yang.25 The photocatalytic reductive ability of the composites is significantly enhanced, while its oxidation ability is improved slightly. Nanofibers become a hotspot of research interests nowadays because of their many advantages, such as large specific surface area, high porosity, good mechanical strength and high recovery capacity. In order to obtain a new morphologic nanostructure of Bi2WO6/RGO composites, fabrication of Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers is a meaningful subject of study because they can be easily recycled from the reaction system. By far, there are few reports on the preparation of Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers by using electrospinning technique in references.
Electrospinning is a simple, convenient, straightforward and versatile technique for preparing long fibers with diameters ranging from tens of nanometers up to micrometer.26,27 This method not only attracts extensive academic investigation, but is also applied in many areas in the previous reports.28,29 The one-dimensional nanofibers constructed by electrospinning technique have a better capability of electron transportation and intimate interfacial contact area between semiconductor and RGO in the nanocomposites, both of them could improve the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst. These benefits of electrospinning will be fully applied to prepare one-dimensional Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers used for photocatalytic water splitting. In this work, Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers were prepared by calcining the electrospun PVP/RGO/[(NH4)10W12O41 + Bi(NO3)3] composite nanofibers. The samples were systematically characterized by using modern measurements techniques, and the photocatalytic water splitting activity and possible mechanism were also studied.

Preparation of Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers via electrospinning
RGO was synthesized from natural graphite by a modified Hummers method, as described in the ref. 30 and 31. In the typical procedure of preparing Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers, 0.3042 g of (NH4)10W12O41 and 0.5044 g of citric acid were dissolved in deionized water at elevated temperature to form a mixture of (NH4)10W12O41 and citric acid, and the mixture was dissolved in 11.7472 g of DMF to form transparent solution. The RGO was added into the above solution, and the color of the suspension turned black. Then the suspension was sonicated at ambient temperature for 1 h using a high-intensity ultrasonic cleaner (40 kHz, 100 W). Next, 1.1642 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and 1.4684 g of PVP were added into the above suspension and the mixture was magnetically stirred for 8 h to form a homogeneous spinning solution. Subsequently, the spinning solution was electrospun at room temperature under a positive high voltage of 13 kV, the distance between the spinneret tip and the collector (aluminum foil) was fixed to 15 cm, and the atmosphere relative humidity was 30–60%. PVP/RGO/[(NH4)10W12O41 + Bi(NO3)3] composite nanofibers were acquired on the collector. After the composite nanofibers were calcined at 450 °C for 2 h in air with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1, followed by natural cooling down to room temperature, Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers were successfully obtained. Other series of Bi2WO6/xRGO (x = 2%, 8%, 10%, x stands for mass ratio of RGO to Bi2WO6) composite nanofibers were prepared by the similar procedure except for adding different masses of RGO.
Fabrication of Bi2WO6 nanofibers
For comparison, Bi2WO6 nanofibers were also prepared via electrospinning under the same conditions without adding RGO.
Hydrogen production measurements
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution tests were carried out in a Labsolar-IIIAG photocatalytic system device (Beijing Bofeilai Technology Co., Ltd.) with external light irradiation. The light source was a Xenon lamp (300 W, PLS-SXE300/300UV, China) equipped with a cutoff filter L38 (380 < λ < 750 nm). Prior to testing, 0.1 g of photocatalyst (Bi2WO6 or Bi2WO6/xRGO), 25 mL of methyl alcohol and 75 mL tap water were added into a 200 mL quartz cuvette successively under vigorous magnetic stirring to ensure the sample was suspended similarly. Then the suspension was degassed by evacuation. All of the experiments were conducted at room temperature. The amount of gas produced was determined using gas chromatography (GC7900, Tianmei Techcomp Ltd., thermal conductivity detector, nitrogen used as carrier gas).
Characterization methods
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was performed using a Rigaku D/max-RA XRD diffractometer with Cu Kα line of 0.15418 nm. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, XL-30 FEI Company) was used to characterize the morphologies and sizes of the products. The composition of samples was examined by OXFORD ISIS-300 energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis was carried out using a JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope under a working voltage of 200 kV. The histograms of diameters were drawn by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 and origin 8.5 software. The specific surface areas of the products were performed by the BET (V-Sorb 2800P) method. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were obtained on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi U-3010) using BaSO4 as the reference. X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) measurements were determined on an ESCALAB 250Xi instrument (ESCALAB 250Xi, America), with monochromatized Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) at 14 kV and 20 mA, and a pressure lower than 10−9 mbar. Photoluminescence spectra (PL) were measured at room temperature using a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescent spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 204 nm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscope (EIS) was carried out by using an electrochemical working station (CHI660E, Shanghai, China) in a half-cell setup configuration at room temperature. In the EIS measurement, the range of frequency was 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz and the excitation amplitude was 5 mV.
Results and discussion
Crystal structure
XRD patterns of Bi2WO6, Bi2WO6/xRGO are recorded and shown in Fig. 1. The characteristic diffraction peaks [2θ = 28.3°(113), 32.8°(200), 47.2°(220), 55.8°(313), 58.6°(226), etc.] of the samples can be easily indexed to the orthorhombic phase of Bi2WO6 (PDF card no. 79-2381). It is also found that the main diffraction peaks of Bi2WO6/xRGO are similar to those of Bi2WO6. No characteristic diffraction peaks of RGO are detected in the all Bi2WO6/xRGO composites. This can be ascribed to the fact that the content of RGO is low and it uniformly dispersed in Bi2WO6, thereby the RGO could not be identified by XRD. This result accords with that reported by Zhang group.32

Morphology and element analysis
The morphologies of PVP/[(NH4)10W12O41 + Bi(NO3)3], Bi2WO6, PVP/RGO/[(NH4)10W12O41 + Bi(NO3)3] and Bi2WO6/6%RGO were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a) and (b) demonstrate the nanostructures of as-prepared PVP/[(NH4)10W12O41 + Bi(NO3)3] and Bi2WO6 nanofibers, respectively. The as-prepared PVP/[(NH4)10W12O41 + Bi(NO3)3] nanofibers are relatively smooth. The average diameters of the PVP/[(NH4)10W12O41 + Bi(NO3)3] and Bi2WO6 nanofibers are 160 ± 15 nm and 124 ± 10 nm under the confidence level of 95%, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). As seen from Fig. 2(c) and (d), after adding RGO into the spinning solution, the average diameters of as-prepared PVP/RGO/[(NH4)10W12O41 + Bi(NO3)3] and Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers are increased to 170 ± 16 nm and 129 ± 11 nm under the confidence level of 95%, as indicated in Fig. 3(c) and (d). It can be clearly seen that the morphologies of Bi2WO6 and Bi2WO6/6%RGO are nanofibrous structure, implying that addition of RGO into Bi2WO6 does not change the nanofibrous morphology of Bi2WO6.

EDX spectra of Bi2WO6 and Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers are manifested in Fig. 4. The presence of Bi, W, O elements corresponds to Bi2WO6, and the presence of C element due to RGO and residual traces from the organics. Cr peak is from the conductive film of Cr plated on the sample for SEM observation. No other impurity elements are found, implying that the as-prepared nanofibers are pure.

To further reveal the structure of Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers, TEM images of RGO and Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers are revealed in Fig. 5. TEM image in Fig. 5(a) shows that RGO nanosheets are highly transparent with folding at the edges, indicating that the RGO nanosheets we prepared are very thin. Fig. 5(b) indicates that Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers are composed of nanoparticles with size of 30–50 nm, and the diameter of Bi2WO6/xRGO composite nanofibers is ca. 120 nm. The results are consistent with the results of SEM analysis. To better study the interface structure between the two phases, the Bi2WO6/6%RGO was further examined with high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM), as shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d). The well-crystallized structure with lattice spacing of 0.32 nm corresponds to the (113) plane of the orthorhombic Bi2WO6.18 The lattice fringes of RGO exhibit an interplanar spacing of 0.35 nm and it corresponds to (002) planar facet of RGO.33 It can be further seen from Fig. 5(c) and (d) that the RGO sheets with the basal plane is perfectly bridged with Bi2WO6. TEM analysis indicates that Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers are successfully prepared.

Chemical bonds analysis
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) was used to confirm the presence of RGO in the Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers and the electronic interaction between Bi2WO6 and RGO in the nanocomposites. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the sample contains Bi, W, O and C elements. C in the Bi2WO6 is ascribed to residual traces from the organics and the XPS instrument itself.34 However, it is anticipated that this carbonization effect would have been similar in both samples as they were subjected to similar annealing conditions.35 Fig. 6(b) shows the high-resolution spectra of C 1s of the Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers. Three peaks located at 284.7, 285.6, and 288.6 eV observed from the C1s deconvolution spectrum of RGO correspond to the C–C, C–O and O–CO (–COO–) groups, respectively.36 The results indicate that the RGO is incorporated in the Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers. As indicated in Fig. 6(c) and (d), the peaks at 158.9 and 164.3 eV corresponding to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 can be assigned to Bi3+ of Bi2WO6/6%RGO composites, and the peak at 35.2 eV belongs to W 4f7/2 and the peaks at 37.2 and 39.3 eV are attributed to W 4f5/2, respectively, which are the features of W6+ in Bi2WO6/6%RGO.34 Compared with Bi2WO6, the peaks of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 are shifted up by 0.3 and 0.2 eV, the peaks of W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2 are shifted up by 0.2 eV, respectively, suggesting a certain electronic interaction between Bi2WO6 and RGO in the nanocomposites exists.25

UV-Vis absorption spectra
The typical UV-Vis absorption spectra of Bi2WO6 and Bi2WO6/6%RGO are shown in Fig. 7. According to the spectra, Bi2WO6 presents intense light absorption ranging from 200 nm to 450 nm and weak light absorption ranging from 450 nm to 800 nm. Bi2WO6/6%RGO exhibit similar absorption as that of Bi2WO6, but the absorption intensity of Bi2WO6/6%RGO is higher than that of Bi2WO6 in the region range from 200 nm to 800 nm. The band gap energies of the samples can be estimated from a plot of (αhν)1/2 versus photon energy (hν). The indirect band gap energies of the samples are similar to the intercept of the tangent to the plot. The relationship between the absorption coefficient (α) and incident photon energy (hν) can be written as α = Bi(hν − Eg)2/hν, in which Bi is the absorption constant for indirect transitions.37

As absorbance (A) is proportional to the absorption coefficient (α), here, α is substituted by A. Plots of (Ahν)1/2 versus (hν) from the spectral data of Fig. 7 are presented in the insets of Fig. 7. The optical absorption edges are found to be 433.6 nm for Bi2WO6 and 436.6 nm for Bi2WO6/6%RGO, corresponding to their optical band gaps of 2.86 and 2.84 eV, respectively, indicating that RGO would almost unchange the band gap of Bi2WO6 in the Bi2WO6/6%RGO composites, which is consistent with that reported by Gao.38
Photocatalytic activity and mechanism
The photocatalytic activities of Bi2WO6 and Bi2WO6/xRGO composite nanofibers were evaluated by measuring H2 production from water splitting under 300 W Xe lamp irradiation using methanol as a scavenger, as shown in Fig. 8. Contrast test indicates that no hydrogen is detected in the absence of photocatalyst, suggesting that hydrogen is produced by photocatalytic reactions on the photocatalyst. As can be seen from Fig. 8, small amounts of hydrogen is detected when pure Bi2WO6 is used as a photocatalyst. Methanol, which acts as a sacrificial electron donor, is able to rapidly remove the photo-generated holes and/or photo-generated oxygen in an irreversible fashion, thereby suppressing electron–hole recombination and/or the reverse reaction of H2 and O2.39 Therefore, even pure Bi2WO6 could generate hydrogen in the aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. While the amount of hydrogen evolution is varied with the different amount of RGO by using Bi2WO6/xRGO composites as photocatalyst. It suggests that the content of RGO has a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6/6%RGO composites when the content of RGO is low (2%), the H2 production amount is also low, but higher than that by using pure Bi2WO6 nanofibers. More importantly, the hydrogen evolution amount by Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers is detected to be as high as 5611 μmol after 6 h, 5.8 times higher than that by Bi2WO6 nanofibers. It is found that the amount of hydrogen produced is decreased when the content of RGO is higher than 6%. It is known that RGO has excellent capability to accept and transfer electron, when composed with semiconductor photocatalyst, it can increase the light absorption range and intensity, and effectively restrain the recombination of the photo-induced electrons and holes, and then the photocatalytic activity is increased. However, the excessive RGO may occupy the active sites in the photocatalyst, shielding them from absorbing visible light,40 besides, an excess of RGO could absorb a certain amount of light and weaken the transmittance of incident light.41 All these could decrease the photocatalytic performance of photocatalyst, therefore, the amount of hydrogen produced is decreased when increasing RGO content. Meanwhile, the BET surface area of Bi2WO6/6%RGO increases to 13.2 m2 g−1 compared to 11.09 m2 g−1 of Bi2WO6, beneficial to its application as a photocatalyst.
 Fig. 8  Photocatalytic activities of Bi2WO6 and Bi2WO6/xRGO (x = 2%, 6%, 8%, 10%) composite nanofibers (0.1 g of photocatalyst was used). 
The enhancement of photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6/6%RGO is assigned to the adding of RGO. It is well known that RGO has a charge-carrier mobility of 250000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature,42 therefore, the incorporation of the RGO might enhance the charge separation efficiency and suppress the charge recombination.37 To study this effect, EIS of the samples were measured under visible light at open-circuit potential, as shown in Fig. 9. The high frequency response is associated with the charge transfer (or electrochemical reaction) at the Pt counter electrode, while the intermediate-frequency response is assigned to the electron transport and transfer at the hierarchical Bi2WO6/6%RGO electrode interface.3 The radian in the middle-frequency region of Bi2WO6/6%RGO is markedly smaller than that of pure Bi2WO6, which indicates an effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and fast interfacial electron transfer. Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers have a more homogeneous structure and stronger interaction between two components with a tighter interface which can accelerate charge transfer and separation. These reasons improve the photocatalytic H2-production performance of the photocatalyst. The result is consistent with that reported by Yang.25

To further research the transfer process of photo-generated charge carriers, PL spectra of Bi2WO6 and Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers under the excitation of 204 nm ultraviolet light are measured. As shown in Fig. 10, the emission spectra of Bi2WO6 and Bi2WO6/6%RGO are centered at 468 nm, corresponding to the intrinsic luminescence of Bi2WO6.43 However, the luminescence intensity of Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers is lower than that of Bi2WO6. It is attributed to the RGO in the RGO/Bi2WO6 composite photocatalyst which could transfer the photo-generated electrons, and then suppressed the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The fluorescence quenching via coupling RGO mainly results from improved interfacial charge transfer between Bi2WO6 nanoparticles and RGO nanosheets, which is shown in Fig. 11. The results are in accordance with the above EIS analysis, and improved interfacial charge transfer leads to the enhanced photocatalytic H2 production activities. On the other hand, the dark-colored RGO absorbs excitation light as well as the emitting light, and also results in the decrease of luminescence intensity.

 Fig. 11  Possible mechanism for photocatalytic H2 evolution over Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers under visible light irradiation. 
Based on the above analysis, the possible photocatalytic mechanism is presented in Fig. 11. The conduction band potential of Bi2WO6 was estimated based on the equation of ECB = X − Ec − 1/2Eg, in which X is the electronegativity of Bi2WO6, Ec is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (ca. 4.5 eV), Eg is the band gap energy of the semiconductor. Based on the Mulliken electronegativity theory, the valence band edge energy of Bi2WO6 can be predicted by the equation of EVB = ECB + Eg. After calculation, it can be obtained that the positions of conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) edge potentials of Bi2WO6 are determined to be 0.46 and 3.32 eV, respectively, and this result is similar to that reported by Gao's group.38 Electrons (e−) are excited to the CB from the VB of Bi2WO6 when irradiated by visible-light. At the same time, the photogenerated holes (h+) are kept on the VB of Bi2WO6.41 Generally, these photogenerated electrons and holes quickly recombine and only portion of them participate in the photocatalytic reaction, reducing the photocatalytic activity of Bi2WO6.44 However, when Bi2WO6 is modified by RGO, these electrons on the CB of Bi2WO6 tend to transfer by RGO sheets, improving the separation efficiency of charge carriers. It has been reported that the two-dimensional large π-conjugation structure of RGO facilitates the transfer of photoinduced electron and can act as an excellent electron acceptor.45 Because the potential of RGO/RGO− (−0.08 eV vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, pH = 0)) is more negative than the conduction band of Bi2WO6,46,47 electron transfer occurs from RGO to Bi2WO6 when they are in contact. The accumulation of electrons inevitably causes shifting of the apparent Fermi level. Thereby, the conduction band edge of RGO/Bi2WO6 shifts negatively compared to that of Bi2WO6. However, the Eg of RGO/Bi2WO6 is nearly the same as that of Bi2WO6. Thus, the electronic interaction between RGO and Bi2WO6 might cause an cathodic shift of the conduction band edge, indicating higher conduction band position and a stronger reductive power which may be involved in the H2O reduction reaction.38
Conclusions
In summary, orthorhombic Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers were successfully fabricated by calcining the electrospun PVP/RGO/[(NH4)10W12O41 + Bi(NO3)3] composite nanofibers. The Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers with the diameter of 132 ± 11 nm are composed of nanoparticles with size of 30–50 nm. When Bi2WO6/6%RGO composite nanofibers are used as photocatalyst under visible light irradiation, the H2-production is observed to be as high as 935 μmol h−1, 5.8 times than that of Bi2WO6 nanofibers. This new finding can be ascribed to the uniform morphology of the Bi2WO6/RGO composite nanofibers obtained via electrospinning method. The composite nanofibers have intimate interfacial contact and large contact area between Bi2WO6 and RGO in the Bi2WO6/RGO nanocomposites, which contribute to increase the separation efficiency of the light-generated electrons and holes, thereby increasing its photocatalytic activity. The result indicates that the electrospinning technique is a good method for preparing photocatalyst. Our work provide a new way toward the photocatalytic water splitting of Bi2WO6 and other hybrid nanomaterials, which can meet the growing demands for energy conversion and environmental purification.
