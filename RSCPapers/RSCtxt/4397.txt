    , Accepted 22nd May 2017First published on 23rd May 2017AbstractNine pBCNx polymers based on a donor–π-acceptor benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-(E)-2,3-di(thiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile main-chain structure and n-octyl/2-ethylhexyl as the side-chain substituents have been designed and synthesized. The thermochromism of the pBCNx polymers has been carefully examined in both solution and the thin-film state. With additional evidences from Raman spectroscopy and AFM microscopy, we have deciphered the varied colours of nine pBCNx polymers in solution and the pronounced thin-film thermochromism only observed for certain pBCNx polymers, i.e., pBCN4, pBCN5, pBCN6, and pBCN8. The alkyl side-chain, and hence the solubility or aggregation of pBCNx polymers, is a main factor of the varied colour in solution and the varied thermochromism in the thin film. We have identified that a stronger main-chain and main-chain interaction are present on the (E)-2,3-di(thiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile moiety, whereas the poor to moderate solubility pBCN3, pBCN5′, and pBCN7 exhibit pronounced thermochromism in solution, and pBCN4, pBCN5, pBCN6, and pBCN8 are four polymers which have good solubility in solution and show thermochromism in the thin-film state. We took navy blue pBCN3 (poor solubility), magenta pBCN4 (good solubility), and reddish purple pBCN5′ (moderate solubility) for the fabrication of bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPVs). With a solvent annealing treatment, the power conversion efficiency of the OPVs has been improved significantly from 4.7% to 6.2% for the good solubility pBCN4, but there is little and no improvement for the moderate solubility pBCN5′ and poor solubility pBCN3, respectively. Our study verifies that the good OPV performance of the pBCNx polymers can be correlated to the pronounced thin-film thermochromism. A good solubility of the polymer is a common characteristic of a material with significant thin-film thermochromism and good OPV performance.
Introduction
It is known that colour change is a good indication of aggregation, packing, or order alignment of π-conjugated polymer chains in the thin-film state. A classic example is the orange-red to purplish-red colour change observed for photovoltaic poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) thin film when it is subjected to thermal or solvent annealing.1–10 In general, the aggregation or packing of polymer chains enforces a more planar configuration and extended π-conjugation system, which has a decreased band-gap energy and hence a longer absorption wavelength. Recently, marked red-shifted absorption spectra were observed for a number of donor–π-acceptor (D–π-A) conjugated polymers in solution on cooling from 85 or 90 to 25 °C, i.e., the polymer solution showed pronounced thermochromism.11–13 These D–π-A conjugated polymers are low band-gap polymers with strong absorption beyond 700 nm in the thin-film state. They have been demonstrated to have a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) when fabricated in polymer-based organic photovoltaics (OPVs).
Within the context of light absorption and colour change, many studies have reported that either thermochromism or OPV performance is very much polymer side-chain-dependent.2,3,12–26 Li et al. demonstrated an OPV copolymer showing pronounced thermochromism in solution, which was attributed to the change in the main-chain conformation due to steric hindrance from the side-chain substituent between adjacent units.27 Previously, we reported a photovoltaic D–π-A polymer pBCN based on a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene-((E/Z)-2,3-dithiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile repeating unit, which showed a dramatic colour change from magenta in solution to navy blue in the thin-film state.28 In order to understand the correlation between the colour change and polymer side-chain, we have prepared and characterized a series of pBCNx polymers, bearing alkyl side-chains of n-octyl or 2-ehtylhexyl or no side-chain (a hydrogen) at four different positions (Scheme 1). Interestingly, at the same temperature (room temperature), the pBCNx polymers exhibited varied colours in solution from magenta, reddish-purple, and bluish-purple to navy blue, depending on the position and the structure of the polymer side-chain (Fig. 1). More interestingly, in both solution and the thin-film state, some of these pBCNx polymers exhibit thermochromism but some do not. We demonstrate that the varied colours and thermochromism of the nine pBCNx polymers are strongly related to the polymer solubility (and hence aggregation) in solution, which is in turn polymer side-chain dependent. Three pBCNx polymers, navy blue pBCN3, magenta pBCN4, and reddish-purple pBCN5′, have been chosen for the fabrication and testing of OPVs to identify the correlation between the side-chain substituent and the thermochromism and OPV performance. We have found that it can be correlated to the polymer solubility in solution, which is crucial for the OPV fabrication with a solution process. In terms of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OPVs, our best pBCNx polymer (PCE of 6.2%) is pBCN4, which is not thermochromic in solution but it is the most thermochromic pBCNx polymer in the thin-film state, and pBCN4 is the most soluble polymer in solution among the nine pBCNx polymers.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The 2-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)acetonitrile compounds (3a–3c) were prepared by a two-step synthetic procedure that we reported earlier (Scheme 2).28 Firstly, 2-(thiophen-2-yl)acetonitriles 2a–2c were synthesized from 2-thiophenecarboxaldehydes (1a–1c) and p-toluenesulfonylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC). While 1a is commercially available and 1c is a known compound from the literature,291b was smoothly synthesized with a similar method to that for preparing 1c. Secondly, based on the synthetic condition of 2a from the pertinent literature,30 the bromination of compounds 2b and 2c in DMF with NBS readily afforded 2-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)acetonitrile derivatives (3a–3c) with over 70% isolated yields. While 4-bromo-2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde (4a) is commercially available and 4b is a known compound from the literature,314c was readily synthesized with a similar method to that for preparing 4b. While the synthesis of A3 has been reported by us before,28 dibromo-substituted dithiophenylacrylonitriles A1, A2, A4, and A5 were synthesized by a similar procedure to that for preparing A3. The electron donor moieties (4,8-dialkoxybenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannanes) D1 and D2 are both known compounds from the literature and they were synthesized accordingly.32–35 Finally, we used a Stille cross-coupling reaction to synthesize the pBCNx polymers, of which the synthesis and characterization of pBCN4 have been reported by us already.28 From the 1H NMR spectra, we noticed that there is about <3% of the minor isomer (most likely the Z-form) in the sample of the 2,3-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile compounds (A1–A5) as one of the two monomers in the synthesis of the pBCNx polymers. Although all the synthetic precursors of the pBCNx polymers have been fully characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrometry analysis, some pBCNx polymers, such as pBCN1, pBCN2, and pBCN3, were mainly characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis because of their very poor solubility in CDCl3 which impedes their NMR study.

Gel permeation chromatography analysis
Regarding the determination of molecular weight by GPC (at 50 °C and with chloroform as the eluent), some pBCNx polymers, such as the poorly soluble pBCN1 and pBCN2, have a rather low molecular weight of less than 13 kg mol−1 for the weight-average molecular weight, Mw (Table 1). A poor solubility may cause the precipitation of polymers in solution, inhibiting further polymerization. Such conjecture is in general consistent with the relatively high molecular weights of the polymers with good solubility, such as pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN8, of which Mw is 89, 52, and 63 kg mol−1, respectively. In general, the polymers pBCN3, pBCN5′, pBCN6, and pBCN7 having Mw between 13 and 57 kg mol−1 is in accordance with their intermediate solubility, i.e., moderate to good, moderate, or poor to moderate (Table 1). A solubility sequence of the pBCNx polymers was also decided by a number of spectroscopic and physical methods in the present study. In addition, pBCNx polymers exhibit varied colours in solution (Fig. 1 and colour code labels in Table 1). The solution colour of the D–π-A polymers is usually molecular weight-dependent. However, this is not the case for pBCNx polymers. Through the reaction time and concentration control, we can prepare pBCN4 polymers with different molecular weights, such as Mw ∼ 9, 30, 60, and 90 kg mol−1, and they all show the same magenta colour in solution. As we will demonstrate in this paper, the varied colours of pBCNx polymers in solution are solubility- (and hence aggregation-) dependent, which is in turn related to the alkyl side-chain of the pBCNx polymers.

1H NMR spectroscopy analysis
Consistent with their very poor solubility in solution, pBCN1, pBCN2, and pBCN3 are the only three polymers missing one or two alkyl side-chain substituents of the pBCNx polymers. On the other hand, pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN8 which dissolve well in solution exhibit well-resolved 1H NMR spectra (1H NMR data in the Experimental section). These three pBCNx polymers have a relatively simple spectral profile, basically two sets of pair-wise broad signals in the aromatic region of 7.3–7.6 ppm and four broad signals separated in the range of 6.4–7.2 ppm. In contrast, pBCN5′, pBCN6, and pBCN7 have quite complicated 1H NMR spectra, which are essentially unresolvable in the aromatic region of 6.4–7.6 ppm. Just based on the 1H NMR spectral profile, we can roughly differentiate the solubility of the pBCNx polymers into three groups, i.e., good (pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN8), moderate (pBCN5′, pBCN6, and pBCN7), and poor (pBCN1, pBCN2, and pBCN3). Interestingly, 1H NMR spectroscopy can even be used to determine the solubility difference of pBCN5 and pBCN5′, a pair of alkyl side-chain (n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl) positional isomers. The solubility difference of pBCN5 and pBCN5′ implies that there is a stronger interaction through the dithiophenylacrylonitrile unit than through the benzodithiophene unit of the polymer main-chain. This is useful in elucidating the correlation of solution solubility, side-chain structure (and position), and the thermochromism of the pBCNx polymers. Primarily, the most soluble pBCNx polymer is pBCN4 and this can be correlated to the four 2-ethylhaexyl side-chain substituents, which have a branched structure providing more obstruction to the close contact of the polymer main-chain. A more precise solution solubility order of the pBCNx polymers can be determined based on the experimental evidence shown in the rest of the Results and discussion section of the paper.
Differential scanning calorimetry
The glass transition temperatures (Tgs) of the pBCNx polymers were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In general, the Tg of π-conjugated polymers is dependent on the alkyl side-chains and the molecular weight. However, except for pBCN1 and pBCN4 among the pBCNx polymers, the Tgs were determined to be in a narrow range of 171–176 °C (Table 1), regardless of the variation of the polymer side-chain or the very different polymer molecular weights. Nevertheless, the relatively low Tg of pBCN1 and pBCN4 (162 and 167 °C, respectively) may be attributed to the low molecular weight of pBCN1 and the flexible 2-ethylhexyl branching side-chain of pBCN4.
Regarding the melting temperature (Tm) and crystallization temperature (Tc), with few exceptions polymeric materials are amorphous in nature and only a signal for the Tg can be detected on DSC thermograms. This in fact happens to most of the pBCNx polymers except for pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN8. To our surprise, both endothermic (Tm) and exothermic (Tc) signals can be clearly found on the thermograms of pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN8 (Fig. 2), and they are at 255, 270, and 274 °C (for Tm) and 222, 213, and 247 °C (for Tc), respectively. Intriguingly, pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN8 are the three most soluble polymers among the pBCNx polymers and they all have a relatively high molecular weight among the pBCNx polymers. In the case of pBCN5, we observed that the appearance of the Tm and Tc is molecular weight-dependent. From a different batch of synthesized pBCN5, of which Mw was 26 kg mol−1 and Mn was 14 kg mol−1, we did not observe the Tm or Tc on DSC thermograms. In the case of pBCN5′, it is a side-chain positional isomer of pBCN5. Both pBCN5′ and pBCN5 have rather similar molecular weights but very different DSC thermograms (Fig. 2). The distinct signals for the Tm and Tc found for pBCN5 were not observed for pBCN5′. Accordingly, we make a speculation for the observed Tm and Tc of the pBCNx polymers studied here: pBCNx polymers become crystalline or semi-crystalline when the molecular weight (or the length of the polymer chain) exceeds a certain number. Even though we have experimental evidence indicating that the dithiophenylacrylonitrile unit involved more than one benzodithiophene unit in the interaction between the polymer chains (the rest of the Results and discussion section), the correlation trend of the polymer side-chain and polymer crystallinity is still not clear.

XRD study of drop-cast thin films
We have tried XRD characterization using a conventional powder X-ray diffractometer at our institution. In each XRD spectrum shown in Fig. 3, a common feature is a diffused scattering signal, which has a varied apex with 2θ ≈ 16.3–24.5°, corresponding to an inter-chain spacing of 3.63–5.42 Å for the pBCNx polymers. A number of reports in the literature have assigned this signal to the (010) diffraction, which is informative for the inter-chain π–π stacking distance. However, there is no clear correlation of the chemical structure (polymer side-chain) and the packing (inter-chain spacing) of the pBCNx polymers. Otherwise, in the low 2θ angles less than 8°, all the pBCNx polymers exhibit a signal, which can be attributed to the (100) diffraction of the lamellar packing structure of the pBCNx polymers. This signal (2θ ≈ 4.3–5.8°) corresponds to a d-spacing of 15.2–20.5 Å. Such a lamellar packing structure has been identified for a number of high performance OPV polymers. It is worth noting that the least soluble pBCNx polymers, pBCN1 and pBCN2, have the sharpest signal profile of (100) diffraction. However, the most soluble pBCNx polymer, i.e., pBCN4, does not have the broadest (100) diffraction signal.

DFT calculation of the dihedral angle of pBCNx polymers
We have applied DFT calculations for the estimation of the dihedral angle between the benzodithiophene and dithiophenylacrylonitrile units of the pBCNx polymers. The results are listed in Table 2. From the calculation results, we have seen a significant difference in the dihedral angles of H and the alkyl side-chain, being 1–12° and around 40°, respectively. However, the difference in the dihedral angles of the different alkyl side-chains, n-Oc and 2-EH, is rather small, and all angles are in a narrow range of 38–41°. Even though pBCN4 and pBCN7 have the largest and smallest dihedral angles, respectively, the 2-EH (iso-butyl in the calculations) side-chain does not necessarily have a larger dihedral angle than the n-Oc (n-butyl in the calculations) side-chain does. Our calculation provides supporting evidence that the side-chain steric hindrance alone is not sufficient for elucidating the variable colours of pBCN5′, pBCN6, pBCN7, and pBCN8 (results and discussion in the following section).

Room temperature solution absorption spectroscopy
The solution absorption spectra of the pBCNx polymers were recorded at room temperature (∼25 °C) in ortho-dichlorobenzene. As shown in Fig. 1, the visible colour of the pBCNx polymers in solution varies from magenta (pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN8) and reddish- or bluish-purple (pBCN5′, pBCN6, and pBCN7) to navy blue (pBCN1, pBCN2, and pBCN3). The three colour codes here correspond to the three categories of polymer solubility, i.e., good, moderate, and poor, estimated by 1H NMR spectroscopy. In terms of absorption spectroscopy, these varied colours are due to the red-shifting wavelength of λmax and the magnitude of the vibronic absorption side-band at longer wavelengths around 620–680 nm (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Room temperature absorption spectra of pBCNx polymers in solution (o-dichlorobenzene). 
Considering that the main-chain of each pBCNx has a same π-conjugation structure, which is mainly responsible for the optical band-gap energy and hence absorption wavelength, such a wide colour range of the pBCNx polymers in solution is amazing and intriguing. Usually, the steric hindrance of polymer side-chains has a great influence on the π-conjugation of either a homopolymer or D–π-A polymer. At first, this seems to be a logical reason to explain the magenta colour observed for pBCN4 and pBCN5, and the navy blue colour observed for pBCN1 and pBCN2. The bulky and branched 2-ethylhexyl side-chain on dithiophenylacrylonitrile will cause twisting of this unit from the plane of the benzodithiophene unit, thus reducing the effective π-conjugation and leading to a blue-shifted absorption wavelength. However, with the same alkyl side-chain (n-Oc) on the dithiophenylacrylonitrile unit, a very different absorption spectrum and hence colour were observed for pBCN5′ and pBCN7. This cannot be simply elucidated by the steric hindrance of the polymer side-chain. A similar argument is applicable to pBCN6 and pBCN8. Moreover, in both cases, the less soluble pBCN7 and pBCN6 both show a more bluish colour than their more soluble counterparts pBCN5′ and pBCN8, respectively. Therefore, in addition to the steric hindrance of polymer side-chains, the solubility of pBCNx polymers in solution should be a more appropriate reason for elucidating the solution colour and absorption wavelength. For those pBCNx polymers with insufficient solubility, the aggregation causes closer contact between polymer chains and it encourages a more coplanar conformation along the polymer main-chain that extends the effective π-conjugation and red-shifting of the absorption wavelength (more bluish colour).
We have noticed that the colour of the pBCNx polymers in solution is closely related to the solubility of the pBCNx polymers, which is in turn alkyl side-chain-dependent. The polymers pBCN1 and pBCN2 have two missing alkyl side-chains and hence pBCN1 and pBCN2 are two polymers among the pBCNx polymers that show the poorest solubility. This is clearly evident in the preparation of solution samples for absorption spectroscopic measurement. pBCN1 and pBCN2 are two polymers that show the longest wavelength of λmax and the most intense vibronic absorption side-band around 650 nm. Because there is only one missing alkyl side-chain for pBCN3 and no missing alkyl side-chain but four n-octyl side-chains for pBCN7, the solubility of pBCN3 and pBCN7 is a bit better than that of pBCN1 and pBCN2 but their solubility is the second poorest next to those of pBCN1 and pBCN2. Correspondingly, their wavelengths of λmax are shorter and the vibronic absorption side-bands are less intense than those of pBCN1 and pBCN2. However, whereas pBCN3 is still navy blue in solution, a broader main absorption band of pBCN7 gives it a slight reddish tint in the solution colour, which is still mainly navy blue. On the other hand, magenta pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN8 are the three most soluble polymers among the pBCNx polymers. These three polymers exhibit very similar absorption spectra, with short wavelengths of λmax around 525 nm and without discernible vibronic absorption side-bands around 650 nm. The polymers pBCN5′ and pBCN6 show an intermediate colour, i.e., bluish or reddish-purple, according to the profile of their absorption spectra in solution. Consistently, the solubility of pBCN5′ and pBCN6 is worse than that of pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN8, but better than that of pBCN1, pBCN2, pBCN3, and pBCN7.
Based on the colour, absorption spectroscopic feature, and solubility, we can logically infer that some of the pBCNx polymers are aggregated under the spectral measurement conditions (room temperature in o-dichlorobenzene). The aggregation of the pBCNx polymers is a consequence of poor solubility, which is due to the insufficient alkyl side-chain substituents or inferior solubilizing power of the n-octyl side-chain compared to that of the superior 2-ethylhexyl side-chain. Meaningfully, we can infer that pBCN5 is better than pBCN5′ in terms of solubility based on their absorption spectroscopic characteristics. This is in accordance with what was inferred earlier based on the 1H NMR study. The room temperature solution absorption spectra of pBCN5 and pBCN5′ show that the molecular interaction on the dithiophenylacrylonitrile moiety of the pBCNx polymers is stronger than that on the benzodithiophene moiety. In fact, this is consistent with the molecular dipole–dipole interaction or hydrogen bonding of CN⋯H–C of the aromatic ring.27,28 Both interactions are only possible for dithiophenylacrylonitrile and not for the benzodithiophene moiety. Following the same reason, a similar inference can be made from the very similar magenta colour observed for pBCN5 and pBCN4. Both pBCN5 and pBCN4 have two effective interaction-blocking 2-ethylhexyl side-chain substituents on the dithiophenylacrylonitrile moiety.
Room temperature thin-film absorption spectroscopy
In contrast with the colourful pBCNx polymers in solution, all the pBCNx thin films exhibit a similar colour of navy blue (Fig. 5). All the thin-film absorption spectra have a narrow range of λmax at 576–585 nm, although an intensity variation of the vibronic absorption band at 620–680 nm was observed. The λmax at 576–585 nm of these navy blue thin films is significantly longer than the λmax around 525 nm of the magenta polymers (pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN8), of which their solubility in o-dichlorobenzene is relatively good, being three of the best among the pBCNx polymers. Therefore, we can reasonably suggest that an absorption wavelength of λmax around 525 nm (magenta colour) is caused by non-aggregated pBCNx polymers, whereas the aggregated pBCNx polymers exhibit λmax at 576–585 nm (navy blue colour).
 Fig. 5  Absorption spectra of pBCNx polymers as thin films. Photographic images of the corresponding thin films are shown at the bottom. Due to their insufficient solubility, pBCN1, pBCN2, and pBCN7 were failed to be prepared in a thin film by spin-coating. 
Thin-film atomic force microscopy
Regarding the solubility of the pBCNx polymers, the fact that the fabrication of the thin films failed verifies the poor solubility of pBCN1, pBCN2, and pBCN7. On the other hand, the poor solubility of pBCN3 is indirectly proven from the comparison of the AFM thin-film images (Fig. 6). Compared with that of pBCN4 or pBCN5′, the very inhomogeneous morphology observed for the pBCN3 thin film indicates the strong tendency of aggregation in the thin film, implying a lower solubility relative to that of pBCN4 or pBCN5′ in solution. The average roughness (root-mean-square, RMS) of the polymer thin films is 11.1, 9.9, and 8.3 nm for pBCN3, pBCN5′, and pBCN4, respectively. The morphology homogeneity of the thin film of pBCN5′ is much improved from that of pBCN3 because of the better solubility. Furthermore, a hot solution (∼100 °C) was required for both pBCN3 and pBCN5′ in the spin-coating process of the thin-film fabrication for AFM observation, indicative of the inferior solubility of both pBCN3 and pBCN5′ in solution, which is worse than that of pBCN4.

Solution and thin-film Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy is useful for understanding the molecular contact interaction of the pBCNx polymers in the solid state (thin film). Firstly, solution Raman spectra were used to identify the thiophene ring vibrational signal of the dithiophenylacrylonitrile moiety. The corresponding spectra of pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN5′ are shown in Fig. 7a. Since the structural difference between pBCN4 and pBCN5 is only the alkyl side-chain of the benzodithiophene moiety, the virtually identical Raman spectra (in a range of 1650–1200 cm−1) observed for pBCN4 and pBCN5 mean that any shifted signal in the spectrum of pBCN5′ must be due to the thiophene rings of the dithiophenylacrylonitrile moiety. Four signals around 1550, 1530, 1480, and 1410 cm−1 (pointed to by a black arrow in Fig. 7a) match such an assignment. Next, comparison of signal-shifting between the solution spectra and the corresponding thin-film spectra of each polymer (Fig. 7b–d) can be a measurement of polymer main-chain (contact) interaction in solution, i.e., the larger the signal-shifting is, the weaker the contact interaction and hence the higher the solubility of the polymer in solution. In the thin-film state, the pBCNx polymers have a stronger contact interaction than that in solution due to the polymer aggregation, which is evidenced by the navy blue colour of all the thin films (Fig. 5). According to Fig. 7b, 7c, and 7d, the extent of the Raman spectral signal-shifting follows the order of pBCN4 > pBCN5 > pBCN5′ and this is consistent with the solubility order of pBCN4 > pBCN5 > pBCN5′. In fact, such an order fits the solubilizing power of the alkyl side-chain, i.e., 2-ethylhexyl is stronger than n-octyl. Furthermore, the Raman spectra also confirm our previous inference, i.e., pBCNx polymer main-chain interaction (or contact) is stronger on dithiophenylacrylonitrile than on the benzodithiophene moiety.

Solution thermochromism
Two sets of pBCNx polymers do not show thermochromism in o-dichlorobenzene with testing temperatures from room temperature (∼25 °C) to 100 °C. The least soluble pBCN1 and pBCN2 are one set and the most soluble pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN8 are the other (Fig. 8). Whereas the colour of the poor solubility pBCN1 and pBCN2 remained unchanged as navy blue, the good solubility pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN8 remained magenta in colour.

The pBCN3, pBCN7, pBCN5′, and pBCN6 polymers with intermediate solubility display pronounced solution thermochromism (Fig. 9). Navy blue pBCN3, purplish-blue pBCN7, purple pBCN5′, and reddish-purple pBCN6 all changed to magenta colour at elevated temperatures. Among them, pBCN6 shows the least degree of thermochromism, which is consistent with its better room temperature solubility than that of the other three polymers. Once again, the relatively better solubility of pBCN6 can be attributed to the efficient interaction-blocking 2-ethylhexyl side-chain of the dithiophenylacrylonitrile moiety. The pronounced thermochromism shown by these four polymers is temperature-reversible. This means that the thermochromism observed herein is purely a physical process, i.e., solubility changes along with temperature changes and no chemical reaction is involved in the thermochromic process.
 Fig. 9  Pronounced (pBCN3 and pBCN7) and moderate (pBCN5′ and pBCN6) solution thermochromism of pBCNx polymers. 
In addition to AFM and Raman spectroscopy, based on the solution spectroscopy characteristics (1H NMR, absorption, and the corresponding colours) mentioned earlier and the solution thermochromism herein, we can propose a more precise solubility order of the pBCNx polymers: pBCN1, pBCN2 < pBCN3 ∼ pBCN7 < pBCN5′ < pBCN6 < pBCN5 ∼ pBCN8 < pBCN4. Such a solubility order is generally in accordance with the solubilizing power of the alkyl side-chain (2-ethylhexyl is stronger than n-octyl) as well as the stronger molecular interaction associated with dithiophenylacrylonitrile than the benzodithiophene moiety.
In addition, from Fig. 9, the relatively more pronounced thermochromism observed for pBCN7 than pBCN5′ is a good implication that the solubility is a more dominant effect than the side-chain steric hindrance on the thermochromism as well as the solution colour. The side-chain substituents on the dithiophenylacrylonitrile of pBCN7 and pBCN5′ are the same n-octyl group (i.e., they have the same side-chain steric hindrance). The solubility (determined by the different alkyloxy side-chains on the benzodithiophene moiety) remains the only reason for the different colour and thermochromism of pBCN7 and pBCN5.
Thin-film thermochromism
Due to the poor solubility, thin films of pBCN1, pBCN2, and pBCN7 failed to be prepared for the thermochromism study. Whereas thin films of pBCN3 and pBCN5′ showed no colour change (Fig. 10), thin films of pBCN4, pBCN5, pBCN6, and pBCN8 exhibited pronounced thermochromism, changing colour from navy blue to purplish (pBCN5, pBCN6, and pBCN8) or reddish-purple (pBCN4). For thin films showing thermochromism, the magnitude of the spectrum blue-shifting follows the order pBCN4 (λmax 525 nm) > pBCN5 ∼ pBCN6 (λmax 547 nm) > pBCN8 (λmax 566 nm) (Fig. 8), which is not the same as the order of solubility in solution, i.e., pBCN4 > pBCN5 ∼ pBCN8> pBCN6. Moreover, different from the solution thermochromism, thin-film thermochromism is essentially irreversible. The navy blue colour of the thin film cannot be fully recovered after thermal treatment at ∼210 °C. We have to take into account the rigidity or flexibility of the polymer side-chain to understand the thermochromism discrepancy between the solution and thin-film state. Two alkyl side-chains of the dithiophenylacrylonitrile moiety are exactly the same for pBCN6 and pBCN8. It is the alkyl side-chain of the benzodithiophene moiety that is different for pBCN6 and pBCN8. The more flexible (more configurations and weaker van der Waals interactions) 2-ethylhexyl side-chains of pBCN8 provide better mobility than the more regular (fewer configurations and stronger van der Waals interactions) n-octyl side-chains of pBCN6 in the thin-film state when the temperature decreases and the polymer chains become more aggregated (and hence have a longer absorption wavelength or more bluish colour) from the dispersion state.
 Fig. 10  Absorption spectra of the thin films after thermal annealing at ∼210 °C of pBCN3 and pBCN5′ (no colour change), and pBCN4, pBCN5, pBCN6, and pBCN8 (pronounced colour change). 
At high temperature (∼210 °C), the colours of the pBCNx thin films are somewhat different from those after thermal annealing treatment (Fig. 11). Thin films of pBCN4, pBCN5, and pBCN8 show the most significant reddish colour, pBCN6 is reddish-purple, pBCN5′ is bluish-purple, and pBCN3 is navy blue. Such colours are very similar to those observed for the pBCNx polymers in solution (Fig. 1). Therefore, at high temperature, the environment of the pBCNx thin films is similar to the solution conditions and the colour of the thin film is dependent on the interaction of the polymer π-conjugated main-chain, i.e., the solubility in solution or the extent of aggregation in the thin-film state.

Photovoltaic properties of pBCN3, pBCN4, and pBCN5′
The photovoltaic properties of these pBCNx polymers were studied in BHJ devices with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/pBCNx:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag. In an attempt to clarify the correlation between the pBCNx thermochromism and the performance of the OPVs, three pBCNx polymers with varied thermochromism, pBCN3, pBCN4, and pBCN5′, were chosen for OPV fabrication. Whereas pBCN3 shows no thermochromism in the thin-film state but significant thermochromism in solution, pBCN4 exhibits thermochromism only in the thin-film state, and pBCN5′ has been observed to show thermochromic behaviour in both solution and the thin-film state. In general, a high concentration of polymer solution (∼2 wt% in o-dichlorobenzene) is required in the thin-film fabrication, and the solubility of both pBCN4 and pBCN5′ is sufficient to meet such a concentration requirement. However, elevated temperatures around 100 °C are necessary for the pBCN3 solution in order to increase the solubility and facilitate the spin-coating process of the thin-film fabrication. The optimal pBCNx polymer and PC71BM weight ratio is 1:1.5 and 1:2 for pBCN4 and pBCN3 (or pBCN5′) devices, respectively. In order to test the influence of solvent annealing on the photovoltaic performance of these polymers with varied thermochromism, an active layer of BHJ OPVs was fabricated with and without a solvent annealing process. The process of solvent annealing was conducted by slowly evaporating a spin-coated thin film to dryness in a covered Petri dish for 60 minutes. The current density–voltage (J–V) plots and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of pBCN4 and pBCN5′ are illustrated in Fig. 12. The detailed characteristic data of the optimized pBCN3, pBCN4, and pBCN5′ photovoltaics are summarized in Table 3.

As evidently shown in the results, solvent annealing is very effective in promoting the PCE of the good solubility pBCN4 and is much less effective at this for the moderate solubility pBCN5′ OPV. Solvent annealing is totally ineffective for the poor solubility pBCN3 OPV. The improved PCE is mainly due to the increase of the short circuit current (JSC) of the device. We have found that the solvent annealing-improved PCE of the pBCNx polymers follows the trend of polymer solubility, i.e., pBCN4 > pBCN5′ ≫ pBCN3. Regarding the performance of the OPVs, the solution thermochromism of the pBCNx polymer seems to be irrelevant. However, the thin-film thermochromism does correlate to the JSC and hence the PCE of the OPVs. The polymer pBCN4, which is not thermochromic in solution, is the only one of the OPV-tested polymers showing thin-film thermochromism. Although it is thermochromic in solution (Fig. 9), the thin film of pBCN5′ (navy blue) exhibits little colour change even at 210 °C (Fig. 11). Similarly, showing pronounced thermochromism in solution, the least soluble pBCN3 is not thermochromic in the thin-film state and it has the worst OPV performance among the three tested polymers. Only pBCN4, showing sufficient solubility and forming a good quality thin film, is susceptible to the thin-film solvent-annealing process that effectively promotes the JSC and hence the PCE of the OPV. Among the three polymers, pBCN4 has the least rigid alkyl side-chains that facilitate the stacking or aggregation rearrangement of the polymer chain in the solvent-annealing process.
Conclusions
We have elucidated that polymer solubility causes the correlation between the polymer side-chain and thermochromism of pBCNx polymers. In order to support such a statement, we have demonstrated that the solubility is a more appropriate explanation than side-chain steric hindrance for elucidating the varied colours and thermochromism of pBCNx polymers in solution. After all, the polymer solubility hinges on the polymer side-chain (H, n-Oc, 2-EH). For pBCNx polymers, more bulky polymer side-chains, such as 2-EH, are more effective in blocking π–π interactions of the polymer main-chain or CN⋯H-π/dipole–dipole interactions of the CN substituent.
By using a series of spectroscopic and physical methods, the solubility sequence of the pBCNx polymers can be ordered as pBCN1, pBCN2 < pBCN3 ∼ pBCN7 < pBCN5′ < pBCN6 < pBCN5 ∼ pBCN8 < pBCN4. This solubility order matches quite well to the solution colours ranging from navy blue (very poor solubility), bluish-purple (poor to moderate solubility), and reddish-purple (good to moderate solubility) to magenta (very good solubility). pBCN3, pBCN7, pBCN5′, and pBCN6 are the pBCNx polymers that show thermochromism in solution and fall in an intermediate range of either colour (bluish-purple or reddish-purple) or solubility (poor to moderate or good to moderate).
Based on the PCEs of the three pBCNx polymer OPVs, the best solubility pBCN4 significantly outperformed the poor solubility pBCN3 and was better than the moderate solubility pBCN5′. The PCE of the pBCN4 OPV was significantly improved from 4.7% to 6.2% after the solvent annealing treatment. Solvent annealing is hardly effective in solution-processed devices if the polymer has a poor solubility. Accordingly, for the case of the pBCNx polymers, we have found and demonstrated that the polymer solubility causes the correlation between thin-film thermochromism and OPV performance. Although the solution thermochromism has no correlation with the OPV performance, the most soluble pBCN4 shows a most pronounced thermochromism in the thin-film state and the best PCE of the OPVs.
Experimental
General instruments

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 MHz or AV-500 MHz Fourier transform spectrometer at room temperature. Fast atom bombardment (FB) high resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) was performed by Mass Spectroscopic Laboratory as an in-house service of the Institute of Chemistry, Academia Sinica. The number- and weight-average molecular weights of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a Waters GPC-1515 with a 2414 refractive index detector, using THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard at ∼40 °C. The glass transition temperatures (Tgs) of the polymers were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a PerkinElmer DSC-6 analyser system. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer lambda 900 spectrometer and a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrometer for solution and thin-film samples, respectively. Raman spectroscopy was performed with a micro-Raman system (HR800, Horiba). A single-mode diode laser emitting at 785 nm served as the excitation source. The laser beam, after passing through a laser line filter to remove side modes and amplify spontaneous emission, was focused by a ×10 objective lens. The excitation power density was set at about 3 kW cm−2 to avoid sample damage. The scattered radiation was collected backward by the same objective lens, and sent to an 80 cm spectrograph plus a liquid nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled device for spectral recording. The calibrated spectral resolution and error were 3 cm−1 and 0.1 cm−1, respectively. For the solution samples, three spectra acquired with acquisition times ranging from 70 to 150 s were averaged; for the drop-cast film samples, the spectral recording time was 30–80 s and six of such spectra were averaged. The obtained averaged spectra then underwent baseline removal. AFM measurements were carried out with XE-100 from a Park System using a non-contact mode to obtain topography images of the polymer thin films, which were prepared by spin-coating an o-dichlorobenzene solution of the pBCNx polymer on an ITO-glass substrate. The X-ray diffraction measurement of the solution-cast thin film (on silicon wafer) was carried out using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a Lynxeye detector. The radiation used was a monochromatic Cu Kα beam of wavelength λ = 0.154 nm. The molecular structures of a single repeating unit of the pBCNx polymer were optimized by applying density functional theory (DFT) with the hybrid B3LYP functional and 6-31G* basis set. To simplify and shorten the calculation time, we replaced the n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl substituents with n-butyl and iso-butyl, respectively.
Fabrication and characterization of polymer photovoltaics
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated on a patterned ITO glass substrate. The active layer of each solar cell device is 0.04 cm2. The ITO glass substrates were sonicated sequentially in detergent, DI water, acetone, and isopropanol. The ITO substrates were then baked on the hot plate at 150 °C for 10 minutes. The ZnO electron transport/hole-blocking layer was prepared by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 1 minute from a ZnO precursor solution prepared from 0.5 M zinc acetate dehydrate in 0.5 M monoethanolamine and 2-methoxyethanol. After cleaning the electrical contacts, the ZnO layer was baked at 200 °C for one hour. Next, an active layer was spin-coated on top of the ZnO layer from an o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution of the pBCNx:PC71BM blends. In the case of the device using the solvent annealing treatment, the spin-coated active layer was slowly dried inside a covered Petri dish for 1 hour. Finally, 10 nm of MoO3 and 100 nm of Ag were deposited on the top of the active layer in a vacuum of about 1–8 × 10−6 Torr to complete the photovoltaic device fabrication. All devices were encapsulated inside a nitrogen-filled glove box.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OPVs were measured in the dark and under AM 1.5G solar illumination from a class A solar simulator (Oriel 300 W), controlled by a programmable source meter (Keithley 2400). The light intensity was calibrated using a Si photodiode (PVM 172; area = 3.981 cm2) from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. For the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement, an AM 1.5G solar simulator was used to generate the bias light. A monochromator (Newport Model 74100), which was calibrated with a National Institute of Standards and Technology calibrated photodiode and chopped at 250 Hz, was used to select the wavelengths between 400–750 nm for illuminating the OPV. The photocurrent from the OPV was measured through the lock-in amplifier (Signal Recovery 7265), which was in turn referenced to the chopper frequency. All electrical measurements were carried out in air.
Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros Chemical Co., or other commercial sources, and were used without any further purification. Organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and chlorobenzene were distilled after drying with appropriate drying agents. The dried solvents were stored over molecular sieves before use. For the solution absorption spectra and OPV PBCNx/PC71BM thin-film fabrication, o-dichlorobenzene (Alfa Aesar) was spectrophotometric grade and used as received. [6,6]-Phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was purchased from UR and used as received.

General synthetic procedures of pBCNx polymers. 
The pBCNx polymers were synthesized via Stille cross-coupling polymerization. A representative procedure is as follows. To a 25 mL two-neck round-bottom flask, distannylbenzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene monomer (D1 or D2) (0.25 mmol), dibromothienylcyanovinyl monomer (A1, A2, A3, A4, or A5) (0.25 mmol), and dry chlorobenzene (13 mL) were added. The reaction mixture was deoxygenated through three freeze–pump–thaw cycles. Then, Pd2dba3 (9.2 mg, 0.01 mmol) and P(o-tol)3 (12.2 mg, 0.04 mmol) were added under nitrogen and the reaction mixture was reacted for 72 hours at 120 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into methanol (200 mL). A dark blue precipitate was filtered through a Soxhlet thimble, which was then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, and chloroform. The chloroform fraction was concentrated and re-precipitated with methanol to obtain dark solids with a red bronze shine and these were dried in a vacuum oven overnight. Among the pBCNx polymers, the 1H NMR spectrum of pBCN4 has been reported before and the corresponding data are listed here again. For pBCN1, pBCN2, pBCN3, pBCN5′, and pBCN7, their solubility in CDCl3 is not good enough to get distinguishable and clear 1H NMR spectra.
