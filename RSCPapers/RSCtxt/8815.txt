    , Accepted 28th January 2019First published on 28th January 2019AbstractThe increasing demand to realize sustainable and clean energy conversion systems has prompted great efforts to develop electrocatalysts with maximum efficiency and minimum cost. Until now, noble-metal-based electrocatalysts have shown excellent catalytic performances toward fuel cell and water splitting electrode reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Despite their outstanding activities, their high cost interrupted any further progress toward practical applications. Recently, the fabrication of metal/metal compound hetero-nanostructures has emerged as a promising strategy to develop a cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalyst. The introduction of metal compounds, such as sulfides, phosphides, oxides, and carbides, appropriately modified the energy state of the metal catalyst to achieve optimum activity, thus lowering the usage of expensive noble metal species to reduce the overall cost. In this review, we present recent advances in the synthetic strategies for metal/metal compound hetero-interfaces within a nanostructure. We also summarize the beneficial and synergistic effect of nanoscale metal/metal compound hetero-interfaces on the catalytic performances. Finally, we provide perspectives on further development of hetero-structured electrocatalysts toward energy conversion applications.Taehyun KwonTaehyun Kwon (M.S. 2017) is currently pursuing his PhD degree in inorganic chemistry under the supervision of Prof. Kwangyeol Lee at the Department of Chemistry, Korea University (South Korea).

1. Introduction
The escalating dependence on fossil fuels has caused fast accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere and world-wide environmental crises over recent years.1–3 To stall or reverse the fast progress toward the inevitable, if not addressed appropriately, environmental catastrophe, there have been world-wide research efforts to develop a fossil-fuel replacing, carbon-neutral energy cycle by utilizing more environment-friendly sources such as solar, wind power, and hydrogen.4–6 Among these, the production and conversion of gaseous hydrogen via electrolytic water splitting and fuel cells have received great attention due to their potential zero-impact on the environment. However, the low efficiency of energy conversion due to large overpotentials at electrodes is the biggest obstacle to the realization of a hydrogen economy. To address this problem, developing high performance electrocatalysts is necessary to enhance the sluggish reaction kinetics and thus to lower the overpotentials at the electrodes. Thus far, the desired catalytic efficiency and durability have been feasible only with noble metal-based electrocatalysts, whose high cost poses as a formidable hurdle to the realization of carbon-neutral energy cycles.7,8 The past few years have witnessed the surface energy engineering of nanostructured catalysts to gain pivotal importance in the improvement of the intrinsic catalytic activity and the structural integrity of noble metal-based catalysts.9,10 The most notable nanostructural control methods are nanocrystal facet control, alloy composition control, and the formation of a core–shell nanoparticle with a lattice mismatch between the core and shell.11–18 In the latter case, the nature of the lattice mismatch between the core and shell determines the tensile or compressive strain on the nanocatalyst, which in turn greatly affects the surface energy of nanocatalysts.19,20 In contrast, while the lattice mismatch or hetero-interface can also be found in both the catalyst and catalyst support, little attention has been paid to the aspect of surface energy modulation of catalysts by the catalyst support. However, recent research results point to the fact that the role of catalyst support is not merely confined to connecting the electrocatalyst to the electrode, since the energy level of nanocatalysts can also be affected by the nature of the hetero-interface between the metal catalyst and non-metal catalyst support.21,22 Therefore, hetero-structured electrocatalysts can be expected to have high performance through the interplay between different phases that is not feasible in conventional electrocatalysts. Recently, significant progress has been made in hetero-interface-based nanocatalysts for energy applications, elevating interests in various hetero-interface combinations such as metal–oxide, metal–sulphide, and metal–phosphide.23–25 Although the hetero-interface appears to boost the catalytic performance in a number of examples, systematic comparison of synthesis-dependent catalytic performance and coherent interpretation of the role of the hetero-interface in the catalysis have not been provided yet. Therefore, we will describe the recent advances in the synthetic strategy of nanoparticles with hetero-interfaces and the noteworthy synergistic role of hetero-interfaces in electrocatalysis in this review (Fig. 1), in order to provide a future direction of this nascent field of research for the ultimate goal of realization of a hydrogen economy.

2. Synthetic routes to metal nanoparticles with hetero-interfaces
Although hetero-structured nanocatalysts are promising for use in energy applications, the synthetic methodologies for this interesting class of materials are only at the fledgling stage. Hitherto-developed methods for the synthesis of nanoparticles with hetero-interfaces can be roughly divided into two major categories: (1) seed-mediated growth and (2) phase segregation.
2.1. Seed-mediated growth
Pre-formed nanoparticle seeds can act as platforms for the attachment and growth of metal nanostructures because heterogeneous nucleation has a lower energy barrier than homogeneous nucleation.26 Through the seed-mediated growth strategy, various hetero-nanostructures, which could not be formed by one-pot synthesis, have been obtained (Table 1).

Wang et al. reported a colloidal method to synthesize metal–metal oxide heterodimer nanoparticles that involves the epitaxial growth of the metal oxide on noble metal seeds.27 In their work, metal carbonyl (M(CO)x, M = Fe, Co) precursors were decomposed thermally in air to form the metal oxide on the pre-synthesized noble metal nanoparticles (Ag, Pt, and AuAg alloy nanoparticles). Pt-Fe3O4 nanoparticles, in particular, were used as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).28 In addition to heterodimer structures, heterotrimers and heterotetramers could also be synthesized by repeating the seed-mediated growth.29–31 For instance, Hodges et al. reported two-types of heterotrimer isomers, Fe3O4–Pt–Ag and Ag–Fe3O4–Pt (Fig. 2A).31 The two isomers were synthesized by directing the nucleation site of Ag on the heterodimeric Fe3O4-Pt. Specifically, for the heterodimeric Fe3O4-Pt seed, the silver precursor in toluene and oleylamine was heated to 60 °C and left overnight to obtain the heterotrimer structures. The Ag–Pt–Fe3O4 isomers were obtained by the facile growth of Ag on the Pt domain because the electron-rich Pt domain attracts the Ag cations. In contrast, Ag–Fe3O4–Pt isomers were formed by forcing the Ag to grow on the Fe3O4 of the Fe3O4-Pt heterodimer, in which the Pt domain was protected by the surrounding Fe3O4. A Rh-MoS2 hetero-structured nanocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), could also be prepared by seed-mediated growth.32 Cheng et al. demonstrated that the reduction of the Rh precursor in ethylene glycol at 90 °C in the presence of the as-obtained MoS2 forms Rh-MoS2 heterostructures. The synthesis of metal–metal nitride hetero-interfaces was reported by Luo et al.33 In their work, TiN nanowire powder was dispersed in N,N-dimethylformamide solution with a 3:1 molar ratio of Pt precursor and Cu precursor. The hydrothermal treatment of the reaction mixture at 200 °C resulted in the deposition of icosahedral Pt3Cu nanoparticles on the TiN nanowire. Recently, Feng et al. reported the synthesis of Cu nanodots (NDs)/Ni3S2 nanotubes as electrocatalysts for alkaline HER.34 Cu NDs were decorated on the Ni3S2 by chemical reduction of CuAc2 in NaBH4 solution with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (Fig. 2B–E). Yin et al. reported the synthesis of Pt nanowires on single-layered Ni(OH)2 as a HER electrocatalyst.35 A mixture of K2PtCl4 and single-layered Ni(OH)2 in a KOH solution was heated to 120 °C in an autoclave to attain the heterostructure.

While colloidal synthesis has been the most commonly adopted method for the formation of hetero-interfaces, other methods have also been investigated, including magnetron sputtering, particle deposition by atomic layer deposition (ALD), electrodeposition, and photoreduction. For example, Meng et al. reported the formation of a Pt-CoO nanoparticle–nanorod hybrid by magnetron sputtering of Pt on the CoO nanorods.36 The low 7% lattice mismatch between the {111} facets of CoO and {111} facets of Pt, and the same face-centred-cubic (fcc) structure for Pt and CoO enabled facile heterogeneous nucleation and growth of Pt nanoparticles. The size of the Pt nanoparticles on the CoO nanorods could be increased by increasing the sputtering time. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was also used to deposit nanoparticles on the substrate. Wang et al. prepared hetero-interfaces between lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) and Pt by depositing Pt on LCO substrates via ALD to control the lattice strain of Pt, which tunes electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).37 When Li ions were extracted out from the LCO substrate, the layer spacing of LCO increased, in turn, to induce tensile strain on Pt nanoparticles. On the other hand, when Li ions were intercalated back to the LCO substrate, the layer spacing of LCO decreased, inducing a compressive strain on Pt nanoparticles.
Through electrodeposition, a metal compound substrate can be decorated with metal nanoparticles. For instance, Xing et al. electrodeposited Pt nanoparticles on the surface of a Co(OH)2 nanosheet to obtain a Pt-Co(OH)2 electrocatalyst for the alkaline HER (Fig. 3A–C).38 They used a potentiostat in a two-electrode cell employing a Co(OH)2 working electrode in a mixed aqueous Pt precursor solution. During the synthetic process, the current density was fixed at 0.25 mA cm−2 at 30 °C for 15 min. Wang et al. reported the synthesis of Pt-decorated Ni3N nanosheets as an electrocatalyst for the HER by electrodeposition.39 Pt nanoparticles were deposited on the Ni3N nanosheets via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using a potential sweep from −1.8 to −0.8 V for 50 cycles. Rostami et al. synthesized a Pd/Cu2O/MWCNT (multi-walled carbon nanotube) electrocatalyst for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) by sequential electrodeposition.40 Cu2O films were electrodeposited on the MWCNT electrode in a basic solution with CuSO4·5H2O and lactic acid. Subsequently, Pd nanoparticles were electrodeposited on the Cu2O/MWCNT in an acidic solution with PdCl2 and H2SO4.

In 2004, Pacholski et al. reported the synthesis of ZnO/Ag heterostructures by photoreduction.41 The slurry of the ZnO nanorods and AgNO3 in the mixture of ethanediol/water (2:1, v/v) was illuminated using a xenon lamp with a monochromator to form ZnO/Ag heterostructures. Similarly, Basu et al. synthesized CuS/Au heterostructures for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through a photoreduction route (Fig. 3D–F).42 The semiconductor CuS nanoparticles dispersed in water were excited with visible light to generate photogenerated electrons, which were then used to reduce the Au(III) ions, without requiring a reducing agent. Huang et al. also obtained a Pt-MoS2 hetero-structured electrocatalyst for the HER by photochemical reduction. The as-synthesized MoS2 were dispersed with K2PtCl4 and trisodium citrate in water and were irradiated with a halogen lamp for 2 hours to form a Pt-MoS2 heterostructure.43
In order to expose the interfaces of hetero-nanostructures and utilize them for catalysis, the later-introduced components must not epitaxially grow on the whole seed. Factors determining the formation of core–shell nanoparticles or heterodimers have been found to be surfactants,44 the ratio between the seed and precursor,45 the degree of lattice match,46 and the surface energies of nanoparticles.44 Casavola et al. adopted a surfactant-directed approach for the synthesis of TiO2-Co heterostructures, by using a binary surfactant mixture of 1-octanoic acid (OCAC) and oleylamine (OAm) (Fig. 4).41 OCAC interferes with the deposition of Co on the TiO2 nanorod seeds, because the carboxyl group of OCAC has a strong affinity to both Co and TiO2. By controlling the ratio of OCAC and OAm, they induced homogeneous, selective heterogeneous, and nonselective heterogeneous nucleation processes. Using the surface energy difference among facets, Mokari et al. demonstrated the selective growth of Au metal tips onto CdSe semiconductor rods.47 The Au complex tends to attach and selectively grow onto the tips of the prepared CdSe rods, since the tips of CdSe nanorods have a relatively higher surface energy and less compactly coordinated ligands than the middle section of the nanorod, and thus are more prone to hetero-growth.

In summary, seed-mediated growth is a powerful tool to fabricate a hetero-structure with finely controlled morphology. Most importantly, the growth position on the seed can be finely modified by the reaction conditions, leading to a finely controlled local structure. The seed-mediated growth strategy can adopt diverse synthetic routes such as wet-chemical colloidal synthesis, electrodeposition, photoreduction, magnetron sputtering and atomic layer deposition, and researchers can choose a variety of synthetic strategies tailored to the type of material. However, the examples of seed-mediated growth are almost limited to the growth of metal on metal compounds. Therefore, the seed-mediated growth strategy is not generally applicable when the seed is a metal nanoparticle. In this case, a phase segregation method is more appropriate to fabricate metal/metal compound hetero-structures, and this will be discussed in Section 2.2.
2.2. Phase segregation
In the case of nanoparticles composed of two or more phases, the increment in the proportion of a specific component in a specific region through atom rearrangement is called phase segregation. Several driving forces of phase segregation such as atomic size, surface energy, and bond strength have been well-explained in other review articles.48,49 Recently, phase segregation in multi-metallic nanocrystals has been actively studied to form high surface area catalytic structures such as nanoframeworks.50–56
The compositional distribution within the alloy nanoparticles can be altered by exposing the nanoparticles to different gas conditions and high temperatures (Table 2). The atom species that are most stabilized by migrating to the exposed surface would migrate to the surface, facilitated by surface-bound gas molecules or high temperature, resulting in the phase segregation and the formation of a heterostructure. For example, ammonia gas could drive the formation of a heterojunction between the metal and nitride phases. Zhu et al. reported the formation of a Co-Ni3N heterostructure by the thermal annealing of a NiCo2O4 nanorod array in an ammonia atmosphere.57 The Co-Ni3N nanoarray showed excellent electrocatalytic performance for both the HER and OER. In addition, Weng et al. induced phase segregation in NixCeO2+x under a reductive gas condition of H2/Ar.58 Ni/CeO2 heterostructures, which exhibited superior activity towards the HER, were formed via the selective migration of nickel ions from NixCeO2+x to the CeO2 surface. The reducing conditions favour the reduced Ni state, causing outward migration of the Ni. Concomitant with the migration to the surface, the nickel ions were reduced to the metallic state. Meanwhile, a Pt3Ni/nickel oxide heterostructure was converted from PtNi nanowires (NWs) under an oxidative gas condition of air at 250 °C for 1 h.59 During the annealing process, segregated Ni formed NiOx shells on the surface of the Pt-Ni NWs. The density of the NiOx shell can be controlled using PtNi NWs with various Pt/Ni compositions. The prepared Pt3Ni/NiOx hetero-interface exhibited high electrocatalytic performance for the alkaline HER. Gong et al. synthesized NiO/Ni heterostructures as electrocatalysts for alkaline HER by annealing Ni(OH)2 at 300 °C under an Ar atmosphere.60 Interestingly, without any substrate, Ni(OH)2 formed Ni nanoparticles under the annealing conditions. However, with the oxidized CNT substrate, NiO/Ni heterostructures were obtained under the same conditions because oxidized CNT impeded the reduction of the Ni species.

Wang et al. reported the synthesis of Co/CoP heterostructures, integrated with N-doped graphitic carbon (HNDCM-Co/CoP), which can be used as an electrocatalyst for the HER.61 HNDCM-Co/CoP were obtained via phosphidation of HNDCM-Co by NaH2PO4 at 350 °C under a flow of N2. During the phosphidation process, the exposed Co was transformed into CoP, while the Co surrounded by graphitic carbon remained as Co nanoparticles. Similarly, Xue et al. obtained Co/CoP electrocatalysts for overall water splitting by partial phosphidation of carbon-coated Co nanoparticles.62 The carbon-coated Co nanoparticles reacted with the PH3 released from NaH2PO2 at 350 °C. The ratio of the Co which transformed into CoP could be controlled by changing the mass ratio of NaH2PO2 and Co.
Generally, metal/carbide heterointerfaces were formed by annealing metal nanostructures in the presence of carbon sources at very high temperatures.63–65 The formation of a Ni/Mo2C bifunctional electrocatalyst was reported by Yu et al. (Fig. 5).63 Heat treatment at 800 °C under an Ar atmosphere transformed the NiMoO4 nanorods coated by polydopamine (PDA) into Ni/Mo2C. The Mo2C phase did not form in the absence of PDA, indicating that the carbon source was derived from PDA. The prepared Ni/Mo2C was used as an electrocatalyst for both the HER and OER. Ma et al. synthesized a Ni/WC electrocatalyst for the HER by pyrolyzing polyoxometalate (POM) with the metal ratio of Ni54W72 with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) at 650 °C under a N2 atmosphere.65 rGO was used as both a substrate for the nanoparticles and carbon source to form carbide. Yu et al. synthesized Co3ZnC/Co nanoparticles by pyrolyzing the as-prepared zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), composed of Zn and Co, at 600 °C under a flow of a reductive gas mixture comprising Ar/H2.64 The prepared Co3ZnC/Co catalyst was used as an electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.

The selective reaction of a component in the alloy nanoparticle can also drive the migration of a specific component to the surface (Table 2). For instance, Liu et al. demonstrated the synthesis of noble metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, and Ir) and an Ag2S heterostructure by migration and conversion to sulphide of Ag in the core (Fig. 6).66 After Ag@M (M = Ru, Rh, Pd, Pt, and Ir) core–shell nanoparticles were mixed with sulphur in toluene, the Ag core was etched out and the Ag+ ions diffused out through cracks in the shell. The Ag+ ions reacted with sulphur to form Ag2S on the shell. Similarly, Wang et al. synthesized PtNi/NiS heterostructures as electrocatalysts for alkaline HER by reacting Pt–Ni NWs with sulphur in oleylamine at 150 °C.67 After sulfidation, the nanowire structure of Pt–Ni was maintained and NiS nanoparticles were produced on the Pt–Ni NWs. Motl et al. reacted AuCu nanoparticles with sulphur to form Au-Cu2S heterodimers.68 Reacting Au nanoparticles with a dissolved Cu precursor and sulphur in oleylamine at 172 °C did not result in the growth of Cu2S on the Au nanoparticles. However, reacting AuCu alloy nanoparticles with sulphur under the same conditions led to the formation of Au-Cu2S heterodimers. He et al. synthesized a metal/boride heterostructure via a chemical etching process of Ni by using active BH4−.69 PtNi3 octahedron nanoparticles capped with PVP were mixed with sodium borohydride in water. BH4− was decomposed to form elemental boron, which reacted with Ni to give amorphous nickel boride. At the same time, the dealloying of PtNi3 occurred to result in the PtNi/NiB electrocatalyst, which showed activity for the ORR.

In summary, phase-segregation to fabricate metal/metal compound hetero-interfaces can be largely explained from a thermodynamic point of view. Compared to seed-mediated growth strategy, the phase segregation strategy is applicable regardless of the type of starting material, metal or metal compound. Moreover, more diverse metal compound phases can be formed via the phase segregation method than the seed-mediated growth method. However, it is difficult to maintain and control the local structure of hetero-interfaces by the phase segregation method, because of the harsher reaction conditions compared to the seed-mediated growth. Many hetero-interface examples utilizing the phase segregation method are obtained without the usage of solvent, due to the required high reaction temperatures. This harsh reaction condition easily disrupts the local structure and environment of the seed materials.
3. Role of hetero-interfaces from the perspective of electrocatalytic activity
Catalytic reactions for energy conversion on electrocatalysts are intrinsically surface-confined, and therefore the modification of the surface of electrocatalysts has been widely studied for several decades.9,70–73 There have been several strategies to modify the electronic structure of the catalyst, namely, facet control,12,74 core–shell structuring,12,75 and alloying.11,76 However, the electronic structure change by the introduction of a hetero-interface has a unique advantage in that it generates a charge density gradient in the nanoparticle catalyst.62,77–80 The simultaneous exposure of electron-rich and electron-deficient surfaces in a single electrocatalyst could be achieved by the hetero-interfaces. In this section, the role of hetero-interfaces in electrocatalytic performance will be discussed from two perspectives, namely, electronic structure control and the ensemble effect.
3.1. Electronic structure control
The generation of hetero-interfaces in nanoparticles inevitably results in the change of the electronic structure of a catalyst. First, the band structure of catalysts having hetero-interfaces between metals and metal compounds undergoes the change in its structure or position. Meng et al. reported epitaxial growth of Pt nanoparticles on the CoO {111} facet, which forms Pt {111}/CoO {111} hetero-interfaces.36 Due to the small lattice mismatch (7%) between the Pt {111} and CoO {111} facets, Pt nanoparticles could be grown epitaxially on CoO (Fig. 7A and B). According to the projected density of states (PDOS) calculation and Pt 4f XPS spectra, the hetero-interface between the Pt {111} facet and CoO {111} facet results in the downshifting of the Pt d-band centre from −2.36 eV to −2.46 eV, which can boost ORR activity on the Pt catalyst surface (Fig. 7C). As a result, the Pt/CoO hetero-interface catalyst showed 3.1-fold higher ORR mass activity at 0.85 V vs. RHE than a pure Pt catalyst (Fig. 7D and E). In addition, the band structure of the metal in the metal/metal compound hetero-junction catalyst can also be altered by the structural change of the metal compounds. Wang et al. reported catalysts with a hetero-junction between Pt and LixCoO2 (LxCO) (Fig. 7F).37 The delithiation process from LCO to L0.5CO results in lattice expansion, and, in contrast, the lithiation process from L0.5CO to LCO results in lattice compression. These lattice parameter changes of LCO subsequently lead to tensile or compressive strain on the adjacent Pt lattice, respectively. This direct and continuous lattice strain imposition leads to the fine-tuning of the d-band structure of Pt, which is directly related to ORR activity. It is well known that the compressive strain induces a downward shift of the d-band centre, while the tensile strain causes an upward shift of the d-band centre.19,81,82 These experimental results corresponded well with the calculation results that a compressive strain on Pt enhances ORR activity (Fig. 7G and H). It is noteworthy that this study showed that the structural change in adjacent metal compounds directly alters the catalytic properties of noble metal catalysts via hetero-interfaces. The change in the overall band structure (i.e., electronic structure) of metals and metal compounds can alter the binding energy of adsorbates or charge distribution in the catalyst.

3.1.1. Control of adsorbate binding energy. 
The electrocatalytic activity of catalysts largely depends on the adsorption and desorption energies of reaction species. In this context, the generation of a hetero-interface can modify the electronic structure of the surface of electrocatalysts, which alters the adsorption and desorption energies of reaction species. For example, He et al. reported the synthesis of PtNi alloy nanoparticles with an amorphous nickel boride membrane and their enhanced ORR activity in an acidic electrolyte (Fig. 8).69 The PtNi/Ni-B catalyst showed 27- and 4-fold ORR mass activity improvement at 0.9 V vs. RHE over commercial Pt/C and PtNi/C catalysts, respectively (Fig. 8B and C). They also carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the enhanced ORR activity of the PtNi/Ni-B catalysts. Their calculation results showed that the modification of the binding energy of the Pt–O and Pt–OH intermediate largely stems from an electronic effect of the Ni-B membrane; the electron-deficient nature of boron modulates the electronic structure of the reactive Pt surface (Fig. 8E and F).

In addition to the modulation of single active sites via hetero-interfaces between metals and metal compounds, the hetero-interfaces can modify the electronic structure of both components of the catalyst. For instance, Weng et al. reported the synthesis of Ni/CeO2 catalysts anchored on carbon nanotubes (CNT), which showed enhanced HER activity in an alkaline electrolyte (Fig. 9).58 The Ni/CeO2-CNT catalyst showed improved HER activity, whose current density at an overpotential of 150 mV was 32 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH (Fig. 9B). On the other hand, the Ni-CNT catalyst showed only 4 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 150 mV. Under alkaline conditions, the overall reaction rate of the HER largely relies on the reaction kinetics of water dissociation, which provides reactive hydrogen sources.15,83 The reaction kinetics of the HER also depends on the combination rate of the reactive hydrogen species and desorption rate of the H2 molecule.83–85 By the density functional theory (DFT) calculation of Ni(111) and Ni/CeO2(111) systems, the Ni/CeO2 hetero-interface interaction was found to lower the energy barrier of the HO–H bond cleavage from 0.87 eV to 0.21 eV (Fig. 9D). The DFT result indicates that the Ni/CeO2 interaction promotes the water dissociation reaction on the catalyst surface. Moreover, the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) values for the Ni(111), CeO2(111), and Ni/CeO2(111) systems showed that the combination of Ni and CeO2 tuned the HBE to a moderate value (−0.33 eV, Fig. 9E), which is almost equal to that of the Pt catalyst.86 In summary, the Ni/CeO2 interface promotes the desorption of the H2 molecule as well as the dissociation of water molecules on the surface of the catalyst by modifying the surface binding energy of the H2 and H2O molecules. The change in the surface binding energy of the reaction intermediate occurs not only on the metal surface, but also on the metal compound surface. These simultaneous changes of binding energies on different sites within a single nanostructure result in further performance improvement via a synergistic effect. This synergistic effect from hetero-interfaces will be further discussed in Section 3.2.

3.1.2. Electron density control. 
As mentioned above, fine tuning of the binding energy of the reactants and intermediates is of great importance for the development of efficient electrocatalysts, and the generation of nanoscale hetero-interfaces in the catalyst proved to be a valid strategy to alter the electronic structure of the catalysts. However, the role of hetero-interfaces is not limited to tuning the binding energy of the adsorbates. Electrocatalytic reactions fundamentally include the movement of electrons, which can be divided into two reactions – oxidation and reduction. Therefore, the electron density on the surface of electrocatalysts plays a pivotal role in their performance.87,88 Specifically, the electron-rich catalyst surface is suitable for reduction reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), due to its good electron donating ability to the reactant. For example, Wang et al. reported a synthetic strategy of Pt/Ni2P nanocomposites entwined with graphite layers and their ORR activity under acidic conditions.89 The Pt 4f XPS spectra analysis showed a negative shift for the binding energy of the Pt/Ni2P hetero-interface, indicating the partial electron transfer from Ni2P to Pt. The Pt/Ni2P catalyst showed 5.51 times greater ORR mass activity at 0.9 V vs. RHE compared to a commercial Pt/C catalyst. On the other hand, the electron-deficient catalyst surface is appropriate for oxidation reactions, such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and liquid fuel oxidation reaction, because reactants can easily donate their electrons to the catalyst. Therefore, the modification of surface electron density by hetero-interfaces also impacts the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst.
The charge transfer along hetero-interfaces is largely affected by their band structure alignment.78,80 Similar to the bulk hetero-junction generated in photocatalysts,90–92 the hetero-junction between the metals and semiconductors in electrocatalysts also generates interfaces of band structures between the metal and semiconductor, and, therefore, charge transfer also occurs in nanoscale hetero-interfaces. Yang et al. reported the synthesis of noble metal/Ag2S nanocomposite structures for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR).93 By comparison of the electronic affinity of Ag2S (3.63 eV) and the work function of Pt (5.65 eV),94–97 the predicted energy level alignment allows electron transfer from Ag2S to Pt. The electron transfer toward Pt resulted in a weaker chemisorption of CO on the Pt surface, which enables more facile CO removal from the Pt surface. The ease of CO removal results in the activity enhancement for electrocatalytic MOR. Also, the formation of a metal-semiconductor heterojunction generally induces bending of the band structure of the semiconductor by their work function difference.98–100 The band bending of the semiconductor consequently forms an ohmic (non-rectifying) junction or a Schottky (rectifying) junction due to the alignment of the Fermi level.100 For the n-type semiconductor case, for instance, the Schottky junction is formed when the work function of the metal is larger than that of the semiconductor.100,101 In this case, the Schottky barrier, which hinders the conduction of electrons, is formed. The engineering strategies of the band structure in a metal–semiconductor heterojunction have been actively reported throughout the past few decades, however, these studies mostly focused on photovoltaic or photocatalytic applications, not electrocatalytic applications.90,91,100,102 Studies of metal–semiconductor heterojunction nanostructures focusing on the band edge engineering for electrocatalytic applications have been reported only recently. Xue et al. reported a synthetic approach of Co/CoP Janus nanoparticles and their application toward electrocatalytic water splitting.62 Their report showed that the Co/CoP heterojunction catalyst has 3 to 6 times higher HER current densities at a 30 mV overpotential than metallic Co and CoP catalysts in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte (Fig. 10A and C). Also, the Co/CoP heterojunction catalyst showed a 3.4- to 9-fold enhancement of OER current densities at a 370 mV overpotential compared to metallic Co and CoP catalysts in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte (Fig. 10B and C). They claimed that the origin of the catalytic activity improvement of the heterojunction Co/CoP catalyst largely stems from their band structure alignment. The CoP is an n-type semiconductor, whose band gap is 1.71 eV, with a conduction band edge position at −0.21 eV versus the normal hydrogen electrode (vs. NHE).103,104 Meanwhile, the work function of metallic Co is much higher than that of CoP.96 Based on their electronic structures, a Co/CoP heterojunction generates Mott–Schottky contact (Fig. 10E). In this case, electrons flow through the Co/CoP interface due to the Mott–Schottky effect until the equilibrium of the work function is achieved.105–107 The electrons supplied from CoP to Co facilitate the HER on the surface of the metallic Co, and the corresponding holes generated in the CoP facilitate the OER on the CoP surface. In other words, the redistribution of charge carriers in the catalyst via their Co/CoP heterojunction improved both HER and OER activity, which largely depends on the electron-donating and accepting abilities between the catalyst and the electrolyte.

Moreover, the formation of hetero-interfaces inevitably results in lattice mismatch along the interfaces, which can alter the lattice parameters of metals or metal compounds in the catalysts.67,108–111 The changed lattice parameters result in the variation of electron density of the metal surface so that the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst is changed.19,20 For example, Xi et al. reported the incorporation of Pd nanoparticles into WO2.72 nanorods, which forms hetero-interfaces between Pd and WO2.72.111 The Pd/WO2.72 catalyst showed enhanced electrocatalytic formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) activity (1618.3 mA mgPd−1) compared to a commercial Pd catalyst (355.6 mA mgPd−1) and physical mixtures of Pd and WO2.72 (792.3 mA mgPd−1). The formation of the hetero-interfaces between Pd and WO2.72 results in the lattice expansion of Pd, decreasing the surface electron density of Pd. This phenomenon could be observed electrochemically by the CO stripping test; the decreased surface electron density of Pd helps to reduce the absorption of CO, which shows a negative CO oxidation peak shift. The electron-deficient Pd surface shows a higher formate adsorption energy, promoting the dehydrogenation of formate on the Pd surface, and this led to enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the FAOR. They also reported the incorporation of CuPd nanoparticles into WO2.72 nanorods.112 Interestingly, the formation of a hetero-interface generated the compositional gradient in the CuPd alloy nanoparticles, with a relative enrichment of Cu composition near the interface. Similar to the Pd-WO2.72 case, the incorporation of CuPd alloy nanoparticles into WO2.72 nanorods led to the lattice expansion of CuPd nanoparticles, as observed from the PXRD data. The CuPd-WO2.72 catalyst showed improved electrocatalytic FAOR activity (2086 mA mgPd−1), compared to the CuPd nanoparticles (779 mA mgPd−1) or Pd-WO2.72 catalysts (1618.3 mA mgPd−1).
The interface between the metal/metal compound changes surface electron density more than the lattice parameter change, modifying their electron density by their electron donation or acceptance behaviour.19,111 Due to the different affinities of different components toward electrons, the hetero-junction between two different composites can be divided into the electron donor and electron acceptor.113–115 The electron (or charge) transfer between two different components results in the partial deficiency and accumulation of electrons within a catalyst, which can boost both electrocatalytic oxidation and reduction reactions in a single hetero-structured catalyst. In other words, electron transfer via a nanoscale hetero-interface enables the fabrication of electrocatalysts with bi-functionality, such as the HER/OER and oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER). For instance, Zhu et al. reported a Co/Ni3N heterostructure array, which showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward overall water splitting under alkaline conditions (Fig. 11).57 The overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 for the Co/Ni3N electrocatalyst was 194 mV for the HER and 307 mV for the OER, which are lower than those of the Ni3N nanowire catalysts (305 mV for the HER and 397 mV for the OER) (Fig. 11G and H). To demonstrate the improved electrocatalytic activity, they conducted calculations to investigate the charge transfer at the Co/Ni3N (−120) interface (Fig. 11E and F). The calculation result demonstrated that the enhanced electrocatalytic activity stems from a faster electron transfer from the Co metal to Ni3N via the N–Co interface between the Co and N-terminated Ni3N. Also, smaller charge transfer resistances (20 Ω for the HER and 2 Ω for the OER) were observed for the Co/Ni3N catalysts than Ni3N (200 Ω for the HER and 9 Ω for the OER), which is consistent with the calculation results. Han et al. also reported Pt nanoparticle-decorated CoS2 nanosheet arrays on a carbon cloth electrode as an overall water splitting electrocatalyst.117 The Pt 4f XPS and Pt Lm-edge XANES spectra indicate the higher electron density of Pt in Pt/CoS2 than Pt/C, which implies electrical coupling interactions between CoS2 and Pt, electron donation from CoS2 to Pt nanoparticles. As a result, the Pt/CoS2 catalyst showed higher HER mass activity (2.1 A mgPt−1) at 100 mV overpotential than the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.53 A mgPt−1) in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The Pt/CoS2 catalyst also showed enhanced OER activity compared to benchmark OER catalysts such as CoS2, Co3O4, and RuO2. To achieve an anodic current density of 10 mA cm−2, Pt/CoS2 showed a lower overpotential (300 mV) than CoS2 (340 mV), Co3O4 (430 mV), and RuO2 (380 mV). In other words, the electron-rich nature of Pt promoted the HER activity, whereas the electron-deficient nature of CoS2 promoted the OER activity. Also, Su et al. reported Co/Co3ZnC nanoparticles with hetero-junctions encapsulated in N-doped graphene (Co/Co3ZnC@CN) for use as bifunctional electrocatalysts for the OER and ORR in an alkaline electrolyte.117 The Co/Co3ZnC@CN formed via pyrolysis of the Zn3[Co(CN)6]2 nanoparticle precursor under a N2 atmosphere with an appropriate temperature (650 °C). The Co/Co3ZnC@CN showed higher OER activity than RuO2 and Co3ZnC@CN, whose overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 is 366 mV. The catalyst also showed a much more positive ORR onset potential at 814 mV than that of Co3ZnC@CN (703 mV). An analysis of the XPS results shows that the electron transfer from metallic Co to Co3ZnC occurs via hetero-interfaces. The metallic Co becomes more electrophilic with the formation of a hetero-interface, resulting in an accelerated oxygen evolution reaction. However, the Co3ZnC with a hetero-interface becomes more nucleophilic, which facilitates the oxygen reduction reaction. In summary, the electron transfer between metallic Co and Co3ZnC facilitated both the OER and ORR under alkaline conditions due to the synergistic effect of hetero-interfaces in bifunctional electrocatalysts. Yu et al. also reported the hetero-interfaces of Co/Co3ZnC, embedded in N-doped carbon nanotube-grafted carbon polyhedra (Co/Co3ZnC-NCCP), which showed a great electrocatalytic activity toward the OER and HER under alkaline conditions.64 The Co/Co3ZnC-NCCP catalyst showed much lower OER and HER overpotentials (295 mV and 188 mV) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 than those of Co-NCCP (387 mV and 265 mV) and Co3ZnC-NCCP (400 mV and 337 mV). Furthermore, for overall water splitting, the Co/Co3ZnC-NCCP∥Co/Co3ZnC-NCCP electrolysis cell required only 1.65 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, which is comparable to that of the Pt/C∥RuO2 system (1.62 V).

3.1.3. Tools to calculate and observe the electronic structure of hetero-structured nanocatalysts. 
A number of research studies have exploited various theoretical calculation methods to predict the electronic structure of solid structures. Density functional theory (DFT) has been the most powerful technique to calculate the electronic structure of a catalyst.71,87,118 The binding energy and binding mode of adsorbates on the catalyst can also be calculated and predicted by DFT calculations.15,119–121 Therefore, many studies on hetero-structured nanocatalysts adopted the DFT model calculations to explain the role of hetero-interfaces in the improved electrocatalytic activity.9,65,69,87 Based on the electronic structures calculated by DFT, the relative charge density in the hetero-structured catalyst can also be predicted.63,122 However, these calculations alone cannot completely describe the real electronic state of the catalyst.
The change in the charge density of the hetero-interface composite can be observed using X-ray-based spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS).123–126 These techniques effectively show the local environment of the catalyst, the oxidation state or charge density of the catalyst, which can reflect the overall charge density change between the hetero-interfaces.
Therefore, the phenomena on the surface of the hetero-structured nanocatalyst have been described by a combination of theoretical calculation results and experimental results.9 For example, Ma et al. reported the synthesis of a Ni/WC interfacial hybrid electrocatalyst encapsulated with N-doped carbon (Ni/WC@NC) (Fig. 12A).65 The W 4f XPS and in situ W K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses indicated the electron transfer from WC toward Ni during the HER (Fig. 12C and D). This electron transfer produces an electron-rich Ni surface, promoting the overall HER process. Therefore, the Ni/WC@NC catalyst showed a lower overpotential (53 mV) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2, compared to Ni@NC (186 mV) and WC@NC (149 mV) catalysts (Fig. 12B). The Gibbs free energy of the HER, obtained by the DFT calculations, is also consistent with the experimental result; the Nimonolayer/WC(001) surface showed a much weaker hydrogen adsorption energy than bare Ni and WC surfaces (Fig. 12E). The charge density changes between the Ni and transition metal carbide hetero-interfaces and subsequent improvement of the electrocatalytic HER performance were also reported by other studies.63,127 Lv et al. reported the synthesis of hollow nanospheres with Co/CeO2 hetero-interfaces, encapsulated by an N-doped carbon shell, (Co/CeO2-NC) for use as an ORR catalyst under alkaline conditions.122 They elucidated the presence of the Co/CeO2 interfaces by Fourier-transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectra of Co/CeO2-NC and Co foil at the Co K-edge, which showed the intensity decrement of Co–Co bonding in the Co/CeO2-NC sample. Moreover, the Ce L3-edge and Co K-edge XANES spectra of Co/CeO2-NC showed the electron transfer from metallic Co to semiconducting CeO2. This electron transfer promotes partial reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in CeO2, resulting in the increase of oxygen vacancy in CeO2, which can be observed in the Ce 3d XPS spectrum. The Co/CeO2-NC catalyst showed more positive ORR onset potential (922 mV vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (797 mV vs. RHE) than the CeO2/NC catalyst in a 0.1 M KOH solution. They also studied the chemisorption models of an oxygen atom on a CeO2(111) surface and CeO2(111)/Co(111) surface to explain the enhanced ORR activity of the Co/CeO2-NC catalyst. According to their calculation result, the CeO2(111)/Co(111) surface (1.39 eV) exhibited the intermediate adsorption energy of oxygen species, compared to the CeO2(111) surface (2.67 eV, too weak binding) and Co(111) surface (−0.8 eV, too strong binding), which facilitates the electrocatalytic ORR.

3.2. Ensemble effect
As mentioned before, the hetero-interface impacts both sides of the catalyst, namely the metal and metal compounds, and, therefore, the modification of each surface may give rise to a synergistic effect on the catalytic process. This phenomenon is called the “ensemble effect”. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline electrolyte is a good example to discuss because the reaction mechanism has been more widely studied and understood than that of other electrocatalytic reactions.83,128 In general, the HER under alkaline medium involves three steps: (1) the Volmer step, (2) dissociation of water, and (3) H2 generation by a Heyrovsky or Tafel mechanism, as follows:
(1) Volmer step: H2O(l) + e− = Had + OH−(aq)
(2) Heyrovsky step: Had + H2O(l) + e− = H2(g) + OH−(aq)
(3) Tafel step: Had + Had = H2(g)
Markovic et al. reported a synergistic effect of Pt/Ni(OH)2 hetero-interfaces toward the HER in an alkaline electrolyte.129 The HER, in an alkaline environment, generally has 2 or 3 times more sluggish reaction kinetics than that in an acidic environment due to the participation of water molecules in the reaction.15,83,84,130 They deposited Ni(OH)2 islands on the Pt(111) electrode, resulting in a 7-fold enhanced HER activity compared to that of the bare Pt(111) electrode. The Ni(OH)2 islands promote the dissociation of water and thereby facilitate the formation of Had intermediates on the Pt surface (Fig. 13A). They proposed a concerted interaction of O atoms with Ni(OH)2 and H atoms with Pt at the interfaces between Ni(OH)2 and Pt. They also investigated the catalytic performances of M/Ni(OH)2 interfaces (M = Cu, Ag, Au, Ru, Ir, Pt, V, Ti and Ni), and the synergy was evident between the metal nanoparticle and Ni(OH)2 toward the HER in an alkaline electrolyte (Fig. 13B).131 As in the Pt case, M/Ni(OH)2 surfaces are 3 to 5 times more active than the corresponding bare metal surfaces. Since the dissociation of water is promoted by Ni(OH)2 clusters, the overall HER activity is determined by the binding affinity of Had intermediates on the metal surface. In particular, the activity of Ni/Ni(OH)2 showed a 4-fold enhanced HER activity than a bare Ni metal catalyst. From the viewpoint of water dissociation, Subbaraman et al. conducted the investigation of Pt(111) and 3d-M metal (oxy)hydroxide hetero-interfaces (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Mn) (Fig. 13C).132 The model Pt(111) electrode surface was modified with 3d-M metal (oxy)hydroxide clusters (M2+δOδ(OH)2−δ), whose valence state differs with applied potential. The overall alkaline HER activity was observed in the following order: Pt/Ni(OH)2 > Pt/Co(OH)2 > Pt/Fe2+δOδ(OH)2−δ > Pt/Mn(OH)2, depending on the binding strength of OHad–M2+δ. For the Fe and Mn (oxy)hydroxide case, the OHad species bind too strongly on the catalyst surface, which obstructs the overall HER. According to their result, the Pt/Ni(OH)2 hetero-interface has an optimum balance between water dissociation and adsorption, thus preventing the over-adsorption of OHad species via the optimum Pt-Had energetics.

These synergistic effects between platinum and nickel (hydr)oxide hetero-interfaces toward alkaline HER have also been applied to nanowires, nanoparticles, and nanosheets.35,59,133 Wang et al. reported that thermal annealing of Pt3Nix nanowires under ambient conditions results in Pt3Ni nanowires, partially covered with a NiOx shell.59 The density of the Pt3Ni/NiOx hetero-interfaces can be controlled by the initial composition of Pt3Nix nanowires; the density of interfaces increases when the relative amount of Ni is increased. By varying the amount of Ni species, the phase-segregated Pt3Ni3 nanowire showed the highest HER current density (19.8 mA cm−2 @ −0.07 V) in a 1 M KOH, which is 6 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts (3.3 mA cm−2 @ −0.07 V). However, when the amount of Ni was increased, the NiOx-based shell became too dense, and the Pt3Ni/NiOx hetero-interfaces were not exposed well, leading to deterioration of HER performance. In other words, a moderate coverage of the NiOx shell, ensuring exposure of the hetero-interface between Pt3Ni and NiOx, is crucial for HER performance. Zhao et al. reported the synthesis of octahedral PtNi–O nanocrystals with NiO-rich facets and PtNi-rich edges via phase segregation in PtNi octahedral nanocrystals.133 The PtNi–O/C catalyst showed the highest HER mass activity at −0.07 V (7.23 A mgPt−1), compared to PtNi/C (5.35 A mgPt−1) and Pt/C (0.92 A mgPt−1) catalysts.
In addition to the hetero-interface between the metal and metal oxide (or hydroxide), the ensemble effects between metal and metal sulfide hetero-interfaces have been also studied.32,43,67 Cheng et al. reported the synthesis of Rh/MoS2 nanocomposite catalysts with Pt-like HER activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte.32 The 5.2 wt% Rh/MoS2 nanocomposite showed the highest HER mass activity (13.87 A mgMetal−1) at −0.25 V among various M/MoS2 nanocomposites (M = Ag, Au, Re, Ru, Pd, Pt, and Rh), which is about 4-times higher than that of Pt/C (3.48 A mgMetal−1) (Fig. 14A). Their study shows that the HER mechanism on the Rh/MoS2 composite is slightly different from conventional Volmer–Heyrovsky–Tafel mechanisms, which is described below. Rh–MoS2 + H+ + e− = Had–Rh–MoS2(1) Had–Rh–MoS2 = Rh–MoS2–Had(2) Rh–MoS2–Had + H+ + e− = Rh–MoS2 + H2(g)(3)

The hydrogen ion is first adsorbed onto the Rh surface, and then migrates to the MoS2 surface by the spill-over effect.134 Finally, the migrated hydrogen atom on the MoS2 surface combines with other hydrogen ions and electrons, releasing hydrogen gas. In other words, the enhanced HER performance of a Rh/MoS2 composite mostly stems from the spill-over of adsorbates via exposed hetero-interfaces (Fig. 14B). This correlation of hydrogen spill-over and enhanced HER activity was also reported by other studies of hetero-interfaces, such as Rh/Si135 and Rh/TiO2.136 Zhu et al. reported the hydrogen spill-over effect on Rh/Si hetero-interfaces, which shows Pt-like HER activity in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte (Fig. 14C and D).135 Based on their DFT calculation results, the proton prefers to absorb on the Rh(111) surface and accept an electron to become an adsorbed hydrogen atom. Then, the Had on the Rh(111) surface migrates to the bare Si(111) surface via Rh/Si hetero-interfaces, whose calculated energy barrier is only 0.24 eV (Fig. 14D). Therefore, the activation barrier of the overall HER process on the Rh/Si hetero-interfaces is 0.24 eV, which is much smaller than that on the pure Rh surface (0.69 eV), implying the synergistic effect of Rh/Si hetero-interfaces on the HER in an acidic electrolyte. Wang et al. also reported PtxNiy/NiS nanowires with a hetero-interface that possess a synergistic ensemble effect on the HER in an alkaline electrolyte.67 The Pt3Ni/NiS nanowire, supported on a carbon black catalyst (Pt3Ni2 NWs-S/C), showed 9.7 times higher HER current density at −0.07 V vs. RHE than the commercial Pt/C catalyst at pH 14. They also conducted a DFT calculation which reveals that NiS promotes water dissociation to generate Had and that the Pt3Ni alloy converts Had to H2. In other words, the synergy between the Pt3Ni alloy and NiS components underlies the increased HER activity under alkaline conditions. The synergy between a metal catalyst and metal sulphide was also reported by Yoon et al.137 They reported the synthesis of hollow Ru/Cu2−xS cactus-like nanoplates via cation exchange and epitaxial growth of Ru on Cu2−xS nanoplates, which have many hetero-interfaces between Ru and Cu2−xS. The hollow Ru/Cu2−xS cactus-like nanoplate showed enhanced HER activity under both alkaline (82 mV overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm−2) and acidic conditions (129 mV overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm−2). The higher HER activity in an alkaline electrolyte implies the existence of the ensemble effect; the HER process on the Ru/Cu2−xS catalyst follows the mechanism involving water dissociation, generation Had atoms, and facilitated generation of H2 gas molecules.
The improvement of the electrocatalytic performance, however, cannot be realized only by the existence of the ensemble effect. Lai et al. reported the synthesis and catalytic ORR activity of PtFe/Fe2C Janus-like nanoparticle catalysts under acidic conditions.138 The PtFe/Fe2C catalysts showed 7.1- and 2.9-times higher ORR mass activity compared to commercial Pt/C and PtFe nanoparticle catalysts, respectively (Fig. 15A and B). They conducted DFT calculations to elucidate the origin of the improved activity of PtFe/Fe2C catalysts with hetero-interfaces. They investigated the energy profile of the ORR pathway under acidic conditions using a free-energy-level diagram (Fig. 15C). In contrast to the bare PtFe or Fe2C catalyst case, the PtFe/Fe2C catalyst did not show any energy barrier for the overall ORR process under acidic conditions. This energy profile tendency mostly originates from the local lattice parameter change in the PtFe region by the Fe2C lattice. However, the calculation result shows that the ensemble effect is not solely responsible for the catalytic performance of the PtFe/Fe2C system. The calculation results also indicate that the band structure of the PtFe/Fe2C interface region, having more electron-rich nature, greatly differs from that of the bulk PtFe and Fe2C state. The generation of electron-rich interfaces stems from the variation of the distribution of the bonding and anti-bonding orbitals of Pt-5d, Fe-3d and C-2p. The promotion of ORR activity also stems from enhanced charge transfer, which stems from an electron-rich nature of a PtFe/Fe2C hetero-interface. This result suggests the importance of band structure alignment as well as the ensemble effect. In order to promote electrocatalytic activity of catalysts with hetero-interfaces, we need to consider the band structure of hetero-interfaces to see whether the band structure allows facile electron flow. In other words, depending on the existence of an energy barrier in the bands structure of hetero-interfaces, the activity of hetero-interface electrocatalysts may or may not be improved. Wang et al. reported the synthesis and electrocatalytic HER activity of Pt/Ni3N and Pt/NiO electrocatalysts under alkaline conditions.39 Both hetero-interfaces of Pt/Ni3N and Pt/NiO can show the ensemble effect with fast water molecule dissociation, due to the presence of Ni3N or NiO, and the formation of Had and H2 on the Pt surface. However, the Pt/Ni3N catalyst had a 3-times higher current density at an overpotential of 160 mV than the Pt/NiO catalyst. Because the work function of Pt (5.65 eV) is higher than that of a p-type semiconductor, NiO (5.0 eV),96,139,140 the Schottky barrier is generated at the Pt/NiO interface, which hinders electron transfer for the Heyrovsky reaction (Had + H2O + e− = H2 + OH−). On the other hand, Ni3N has metallic character which can deliver electrons toward the Pt.141,142 The promotion of water dissociation is also achieved using atomically thin Ni(OH)2 layers generated by the surface oxidation of Ni3N. They also conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), revealing that the charge transfer resistances of the Pt/Ni3N hybrid (0.85 Ω) is much smaller than that of Pt/NiO (2.39 Ω), although the solution and diffusion resistances are similar; 1.92 and 0.93 Ω for Pt/Ni3N, and 2.01 and 0.54 Ω for Pt/NiO, respectively.

Moreover, the effect of hetero-structures toward the charge transfer ability stems from the modification of local atomic structures such as cation/anion vacancies as well as band structure alignment. For example, Odedario et al. also reported the importance of charge transfer ability in electrocatalytic performance.143 They studied the synthesis and electrocatalytic OER performance of Ni/Ce-doped Fe2O3 hetero-structures (Ni/Ce-Fe2O3). The Ni/Ce-Fe2O3 catalyst showed higher specific activity (1.12 mA cmox−2) toward the OER in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte at 1.58 V vs. RHE than Ni/Fe2O3 (0.14 mA cmox−2), Ce-Fe2O3 (0.17 mA cmox−2) and Fe2O3 (0.028 mA cmox−2) catalysts. They also conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), revealing that the Ni/Ce-Fe2O3 showed the lowest interfacial charge transfer resistance (25 Ω), compared to Ni/Fe2O3 (49 Ω) and Ce-Fe2O3 (85 Ω). Based on their Ce-3d and O-1s XPS analysis, the incorporation of Ce species into Fe2O3 results in a large number of oxygen vacancies in Fe2O3. Moreover, the incorporated Ni nanoparticles in Ce-Fe2O3 further increase the number of oxygen vacancies, which boosts the charge transfer ability of the catalyst.
4. Outlook
The discussion of nanostructured electrocatalysts containing metal/metal compound hetero-interfaces points to the added benefit of introduction of a heterointerface toward important electrocatalytic reactions, which explains the recent surge in interest in nanoscale hetero-interfaces for catalytic applications. However, rational synthetic routes to fabricate well-defined, in both terms of nanoscale dimension control and compositional control, hetero-interfaces are very underdeveloped. Moreover, our understanding of hetero-interfaces in boosting electrocatalytic activity is still at its infancy. Therefore, the following points should be addressed for further development of hetero-structured nanocatalysts for electrocatalytic applications.
4.1. The role of hetero-interfaces in catalyst stability
As discussed in Section 3.1, the unique band structure largely affects the adsorption and desorption energy of molecules, demonstrating the beneficial effect of hetero-interfaces toward important electrode reactions such as the HER, OER, and ORR. However, it is also possible that the formed hetero-interfaces might deteriorate the catalytic activity of the active centre of the catalyst. Moreover, the modified band and crystal structure by hetero-interfaces can affect the stability of the metal/metal compound hetero-junction structure.144–146 Lu et al. reported the Pd hydride nanocubes embedded in amorphous NiB nanosheets for active and stable ORR electrocatalysts.147 The ultrahigh chemical stability and strong chemical interaction with PdHx of Ni-B nanosheets improved the overall stability of the PdHx/NiB catalyst. Therefore, to overcome the stability issue, the combination of catalysts and metal compounds with high chemical stability can be a powerful strategy. However, there are hordes of materials without innate stability where the stability issue can be a very tricky matter. Furthermore, while the stability of each compound composing the hetero-interface can be quite high, the generated hetero-interface might not be stable at all. Therefore, the durability of the generated hetero-interfaces has to be considered when designing the catalyst. Recently, Kim et al. reported that the {111} facet of NiO/Ni and {100} facet of β-NiOOH allow a strong binding so that the exfoliation of β-NiOOH is greatly suppressed.146 Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the structural stability of hetero-interfaces is needed for appropriate electrocatalyst designs.
4.2. Beyond hetero-interfaces between metals and metal compounds: consideration of the supporting carbon substrate
Carbon-based materials such as 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs), 2D graphene, and other analogues of graphitic carbon, such as C3N4, have been actively studied as substrate materials for electrocatalysts.148–151 Therefore, there have been a number of studies that address the interaction between the metal catalyst and carbon substrates.152–155 Moreover, as mentioned in Section 2, the synthetic strategies to prepare catalyst structures with nanoscale hetero-interfaces might necessitate the incorporation of carbon-based support materials during the synthesis.63,89,122,127,156 For instance, the thermal annealing of Ni(OH)2 with CNTs under a low pressure resulted in Ni/NiO hetero-structured nanoparticles supported by CNTs, while the annealing without the CNTs only resulted in metallic Ni nanoplates.60,122 The junction with the carbon substrate would affect the electronic properties of metals and/or metal compounds, which directly regulates the overall activity and stability of catalysts.157,158 Moreover, the ensemble effects on the metal/carbon or metal compound/carbon interfaces as well as the metal/metal compound interface will also occur. Therefore, in order to better understand the phenomena on hetero-interfaces and to boost the performance of hetero-structured electrocatalysts, the consideration of the nature of carbon-based supporting materials must be included.
4.3. Facet control of hetero-interfaces between metals and metal compounds
As discussed in Section 3.2, the unique role of hetero-interfaces in electrocatalytic reactions largely stems from their ability to transfer electrons between metals and metal compounds. This charge transfer ability can be controlled by the fine-tuning of the band structures of metal and metal compounds, which can be diversified by the nature of the interface, such as contact geometry, facets, and morphology.159–161 In this context, the fine-tuning of the local geometry of the hetero-interface can be an essential tool to develop advanced electrocatalysts having hetero-interfaces. Several studies have been reported on the facet-dependent electrical conductivity of semiconductors.162–167 For instance, Tan et al. reported that the conductivity of semi-conducting Cu2O single crystals differs by their facets; the {111} facets are highly conductive, while the conductivity of the {100} and {110} facets is dramatically lower than that of the {111} facets.167 Therefore, the contacting facets between the metal and metal compounds will have a great effect on the electron transfer behaviour along the hetero-interfaces. Further studies to control the contacting geometry of hetero-interfaces might elevate the level of design strategies of heterogeneous electrocatalysts. The hetero-interfaces with well-defined facets or shapes might be fabricated via the strategies mentioned in Section 2. For example, seed-mediated growth on well-defined nanocrystals could be a method to prepare facet-controlled hetero-interfaces.
4.4. Development of tools to observe the catalytic phenomena in hetero-interfaces
One of the important issues in hetero-structured electrocatalysts is how to observe and understand the phenomena within the hetero-interface and surface of catalysts. To address this issue, several in situ surface analysis techniques based on X-ray spectroscopy have been reported to observe the real-time structure of the catalyst.65,168,169 Also, the existence of the ensemble effects on hetero-interfaces has been explained by theoretical calculations.135,170–172 However, these theoretical and experimental techniques provide only indirect explanations to the phenomenon on the hetero-interfaces. However, the direct observation of a beneficial effect on the hetero-interfaces of catalysts during catalysis has rarely been reported.
Only recently, real-time observations of the phenomena on hetero-interfaces have been attempted. Lee et al. reported hot-electron flow by chemical reaction via real-time current measurements on a metal–semiconductor nanodiode.173 Also, Panayotov et al. reported a direct observation of the hydrogen spill-over effect on Rh/TiO2 hetero-interfaces by combining transmission infrared spectroscopy of donated electrons and exchange dynamics of co-adsorbed CO and H/D to study the hydrogen interaction with Rh/TiO2.136 However, these real-time observation techniques have been operated without applied potentials. The development of in situ cell designs and real-time observations of hetero-interfaces of electrocatalysts would greatly elevate our knowledge and understanding of the origin of the beneficial effects by nanoscale hetero-interfaces, which would culminate in an effective design strategy toward highly active and stable electrocatalysts.
5. Conclusion
As described in this review, metal/metal compound composite electrocatalysts with nanoscale hetero-interfaces show great potential toward various electrode reactions, such as the HER, OER, and ORR. The formation of a hetero-junction between the two components modulates the electronic structures of both sides of the composite, which simultaneously improves the electrocatalytic activity toward multiple catalytic reactions and allow bifunctional activity in a catalyst structure. Moreover, the origin of the enhanced electrocatalytic activity stems not only from the modification of the electronic structure of the catalyst via hetero-interface formation, but also from the synergistic effect between two composites in the hetero-structured electrocatalyst. The surface-exposed hetero-interfaces can be another active centre for catalytic reactions; the adsorbed reaction species can migrate from one component to the other via the hetero-interface. This ensemble effect enables the formation of an unprecedented catalytic reaction pathway during catalysis, which promotes the overall reaction rate. Although the exact origin for the synergistic effect of surface-exposed hetero-interfaces is still being debated, great efforts are being made to understand the phenomena on the hetero-interfaces via in situ techniques. It is extremely intriguing to develop nanoscale hetero-interfaces within a catalyst structure, which maximizes the synergy between both components as well as optimizes the electronic structure of catalyst. Therefore, the development of in situ observation techniques and further honing of theoretical calculations will be powerful allies to synthetic chemists searching for highly optimized and stable hetero-interfaced catalysts toward important electrocatalytic reactions for energy applications.
