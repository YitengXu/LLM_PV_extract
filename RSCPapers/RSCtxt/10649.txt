    , Accepted 7th December 2012First published on 10th December 2012AbstractLinde Type A with Na cation (LTA-Na) nanozeolite-based TiO2 photoanodes have been implemented in dye-sensitized solar cells introducing the concept of an integrated getter. These innovative structures improve the device stability thanks to their ability to neutralize the moisture effect, while also acting as active scattering centers.
1. Introduction
Among the photovoltaic systems which promise low cost fabrication methods, hybrid solar cells, where metal oxides are interfaced to organic materials, are of great interest and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) are a realistic option with market-appealing power conversion efficiencies above 12%.1 However, they still remain an interesting playground for scientists, engineers and technologists as many issues regarding the devices' working processes still have to be fully unveiled. On top of this, long term stability is a crucial problem for the actual development of the technology. Accelerated tests have revealed both intrinsic instability issues related to the active materials (e.g. photo-oxidation, thermal stress) and an extrinsic instability mainly due to the presence of a liquid phase in the device structure (the solvent based electrolytes).1
The presence of good packaging is crucial to achieve a long lifetime. Bad sealing can cause electrolyte leakages, solvent evaporation and the penetration of impurities, compromising DSSC stability. In particular the infiltration of water has been found to be a critical factor. Though an enhancement of device performance has been reported in fresh solar cells when adding a small amount of water to ionic liquid electrolytes,2 it is considered detrimental to the long term stability of the device.3,4 In fact it can cause dye desorption,5,6 loss of iodine,7 solvent poisoning and changes in the surface properties of the TiO2,8–10 causing a decrease in the cell efficiency. Therefore water intrusion must be avoided or water molecules must be rendered inoffensive. In most of the flexible and inexpensive designed plastic barriers, as opposed to glass, water can permeate into the device relatively rapidly. In fact, after one year of outdoor exposure, their function is neutralized.11
Permeation can be reduced by more effective barrier layers (e.g. perfluorurate polymers), but this solution generally increases the cost of the device. Moreover, it must be considered that it is extremely difficult to get rid of a residual amount of water during the fabrication process.
Here we propose an alternative solution. Getters, made of zeolites that are able to absorb water, are directly integrated in the TiO2 active layer, realizing an example of an active getter. Low-silica zeolites are hydrophilic materials12 with the capability to adsorb and desorb water without damaging the framework. Thanks to this property, they are very useful as desiccants, though they have also been widely used in many industrial applications as sorbents for the separation of liquid or gaseous compounds, as molecular sieves, for ion-exchange purposes and as catalysts.
Zeolites are very versatile materials also from a structural point of view as the pore size and shape can be easily controlled. This feature has been exploited in DSSC applications where titanium dioxide clusters have been encapsulated in a microporous zeolitic matrix.13 However, the solar cells showed very poor performances due to both inefficient charge separation at the dye/photoanode interface and poor charge transport.
In this work we demonstrate that the introduction of Linde Type A with Na cation (LTA-Na) nanozeolites in the TiO2 layer does not affect the device performance, while it improves the device stability under outdoor testing. Notably, their integration is perfectly compatible with the established device processing procedure as the zeolites can already be activated during the sintering process of the TiO2 mesoporous structure which is generally run at 500 °C. In this way, the active compounds in the device are already protected by the zeolites from the first steps of the fabrication process. Moreover, we demonstrate that by exploiting the possibility of tuning the zeolite size, we can improve the scattering properties of the photoanode, thus introducing for the first time the concept of an integrated getter. To the authors' knowledge, this is the highest level of integration of getter components achieved so far in monolithic optoelectronic devices.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with 3D open framework structures built of SiO2 and AlO4 tetrahedra. They are linked to each other by sharing all the oxygen atoms in order to form regular intra-crystalline cavities and channels of molecular dimensions where cations, water and/or small molecules may reside.
The LTA (Linde Type A) structure has a 3-dimensional pore structure with pores running perpendicular to each other in the x, y, and z planes, and is made of secondary building units 4, 6, 8, and 4-4. The pore diameter is defined by an eight membered oxygen ring with a small size of 4.2 Å. This leads into a larger cavity with a minimum free diameter of 11.4 Å. The cavity is surrounded by eight sodalite cages (truncated octahedra) connected by their square faces in a cubic structure. The unit cell is cubic (a = 24.61 Å) with Fm-3c symmetry. Zeolite A has a void volume fraction of 0.47, with a Si/Al ratio of 1.0. This structure allows them to be particularly indicated for the sorption of moisture.
The main characteristic of the SAES synthesis is to obtain nanoscale size zeolites.
2.2 Device fabrication
Nanoporous TiO2 substrates were deposited by a doctor-blading technique on a transparent conducting glass (FTO TEC 15 Ω/square, Pilkington) starting from a paste containing about 20 nm nanoparticles (DSL18NR-T, Dyesol). We used the same technique to deposit the photoanodes with LTA-Na nanozeolites, but in this case these getters have been added to the starting commercial TiO2 paste in different weight concentrations of 1 wt%, 3 wt% and 5 wt%. The TiO2 substrates were about 6 μm thick. No scattering layer was deposited on the first layer in order to clarify the role of the nanozeolite dispersion. Afterward the photoelectrodes were heated to 500 °C; this temperature was maintained for 30 min. After the sintering process, the substrates were immersed in a 15 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 1 h and then left on a hot plate at 550 °C for 45 min. They were immersed in a 0.2 mM solution of N719 dye in acetonitrile/tert-butanol (1:1) for 1 day. The sensitized substrates were rinsed and dried, then the photoanode was superimposed to the counterelectrode (a platinised FTO) and it was sealed with a 50 μm thick thermoplastic sealant (Bynel 50, Dupont). A commercial platinum solution (CELS, Dyesol) has been used to create the platinised counterelectrode. Finally we injected the electrolyte (0.15 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.5 M 1-methylbenzimidazole, 0.8 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide in 3-methoxypropionitrile) into the cell through a hole drilled through the counterelectrode.
2.3 Materials and devices characterization
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is a non-invasive technique, now well-established, also known as PCS (Photon Correlation Spectroscopy) or QELS (Quasi-Elastic Light Scattering), for measuring the size of molecules, nanoparticles or colloids typically of a sub-micronic size. In DLS measurements the sample is illuminated by a laser beam (780 nm, 5 mW), and the variations of intensity of scattered light are measured as a function of time. Variations in the intensity measured by the photodiode detector are generated by the Brownian motion of the particles at the origin of the scattering. At constant temperature and viscosity, the ‘small' particles move quickly – creating rapid changes in the intensity of scattering – while the ‘big' particles move more slowly, by creating variations of intensity lens. In this way, the speed of changes in intensity is measured, and the diffusion coefficient of the particles can be calculated. The Stokes–Einstein equation allows us to convert the coefficient of diffusion into hydrodynamic diameter.
All current–voltage characteristics of the solar cells were measured by a Keithley 2440 Source Meter under 1 sun illumination (AM1.5) provided by a solar simulator (Oriel class AAA, Newport). The active area of the devices was determined using a black mask of 0.185 cm2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement was carried out by using a quartz tungsten halogen lamp (Newport) coupled to a monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone™ 260 1/4 m). A calibrated silicon diode was used as a reference.
Absorption spectra were measured with a spectrophotometer (LAMBDA 1050 UV/Vis/NIR, Perkin Elmer). For the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) the photoanodes were sensitized with N719 dye as explained above. LHE spectra were obtained by calculating the difference between the values obtained with and without dye loading. Light-scattering phenomena were characterized by measuring the transmittance and reflectance spectra of the unsensitized photoanodes with an integrating sphere included in the spectrophotometer. Afterward these spectra were used to calculate the photoanode haze as the ratio of diffused light to the total light transmitted through the films.
To evaluate the dye loading on the surface of TiO2 films, dye molecules were desorbed from the photoanodes by immersing them in a NaOH aqueous solution (0.1 M). The amount of dye adsorbed was obtained from the absorbance of the spectrum at 500 nm of this solution according to Beer's law and using the measured molar extinction coefficient of the dye. Film thickness was determined with a Tencor Alpha-Step IQ surface profilometer.
3. Results and discussion
TiO2 particles of the order of hundreds of nanometers are widely used as scattering centers to trap the light inside the DSSC photoanode.14–16 In this way the optical path length is increased and consequently also the fraction of light absorbed by the cell. With this in mind, we synthesized LTA-Na nanozeolites with a diameter of about 300 nm. The size distribution of the nanoparticles has been measured by dynamic light scattering and is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Nanozeolite size distribution measured by the dynamic light scattering technique. 
Mesoporous TiO2 layers (7 μm) were fabricated by dispersing nanozeolites at different concentrations, ranging between 0% and 5%. Then, they were sensitized by the N719 dye which has an absorption peak at 530 nm (see absorption spectrum in Fig. 2). We have first measured the dye loading capability of the photoanodes, whose values are reported in Table 1. By increasing the concentration of nanozeolites in the TiO2 films the dye loading decreases. In principle this should be detrimental to the light harvesting capability of the device. Thus, we verify the optical properties of the photoanodes by measuring the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of the photoanodes at different nanozeolite concentrations (Fig. 2). The spectra show an improvement in the light harvesting capability of the photoanode, though the dye loading is poorer, especially at longer wavelengths. Therefore, the haze was calculated upon measurement of the transmittance and reflectance spectra using an integrating sphere16 (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). In Table 1 the haze values taken in the red side of the dye absorption spectrum, namely at 650 nm, are presented. They show an enhancement of the light scattering as the nanozeolite concentration increases.

We have implemented these unconventional photoanodes in DSSCs. N719 was chosen as an antenna and a high stability electrolyte was chosen as the regenerating medium (see experimental section).17 7 μm thick single-layer photoanodes were used in order to directly address the nanozeolite-based photoanodes properties. Devices were tested under AM1.5 conditions. The J–V characteristics of the best performing devices are shown in Fig. 3, while the figures of merit of the cells are reported in Table 2 reporting the error range for each figure of merit. The control sample shows state of the art parameters17 with regard to the chosen device structure. When the nanozeolites are added to the photoanode the devices show very similar characteristics. This result is extremely important. In fact, the DSSC is a multi-component system, whose functionality goes beyond the functionality of each single component and strongly depends on the synergy of all of them. This means that once one single component is changed the entire device often needs to be re-designed. In this case, the introduction of the nanozeolites does not affect the standard device performance. Moreover, we can conclude that the scattering properties of the photoanode can compensate for the lower dye loading in the presence of the zeolites, resulting in an overall comparable photocurrent in the working devices.

Finally, the device lifetime was tested over 1000 h of outdoor exposure (Milan, November 2011). The efficiency of the DSSC with different nanozeolite concentrations is shown in Fig. 4. After the first 200 h of exposure all devices show an enhancement of 20% in their efficiency with respect to the starting values which we attributed to the light soaking effect, recently discussed by Listorti et al.18 (see Fig. S3c in the ESI†). After 1000 h, the control sample without nanozeolites shows a decrease of 20% in efficiency. Looking at the trend of each figure of merit along the ageing process (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†), one can observe that the main reason for the degradation of the solar cells is a reduction in the photocurrent. This may be in agreement with dye desorption in the presence of water. On the other hand, in the presence of nanozeolites, the device performance remains stable over time.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time the concept of an integrated getter in a monolithic device. 300 nm sized nanozeolites have been included in the TiO2 photoanode without perturbing the device performances, thus showing the suitability of this solution with the DSSC processing. Thanks to the capability of the nanozeolites to absorb water under activation above 450 °C, we have demonstrated an improved stability of the solar cells after 1000 h of outdoor exposure. The optical properties of this innovative structure have also been investigated demonstrating their functionality as active scattering centers. The inclusion of nanozeolites in TiO2 films is therefore a promising solution to improve the DSSC lifetime. Further investigation is now planned in order to study in detail the optoelectronic properties of these innovative photoanodes, such as the charge transport and recombination mechanisms in the layer, which, impressively, do not seem to be affected by the presence of the zeolite nanoparticles. Moreover their implementation will be tested in solid state DSSCs where improving the light harvesting capability of the device is as important as improving the device lifetime.
