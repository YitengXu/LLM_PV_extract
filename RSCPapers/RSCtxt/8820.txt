    , Accepted 6th June 2018First published on 6th June 2018AbstractEnhancing the charge separation by a semiconductor heterojunction is greatly promising and challenging for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Here, we report for the first time the design and fabrication of a TaON/Ta3N5 heterojunction photoanode, in which the electrode Ta3N5 is the primary light absorber and TaON acts as an electron conductor. By combining the merits of the substantial light harvesting of Ta3N5 with the excellent charge transport capability of TaON, the TaON/Ta3N5 heterojunction photoanode, without any co-catalysts, shows a 350 mV negative shift of photocurrent onset potential to 0.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) compared to that of the Ta3N5 photoanode. The design and fabrication scheme can be readily extended to other (oxy)nitride semiconductors for heterojunction construction.
Introduction
The use of sunlight-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen promises an attractive prospect for effective solar-energy harvesting and storage.1 For PEC devices to be commercially implemented, we require low-cost materials that are nontoxic and able to achieve over 10% solar to hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency.2 Among various candidates investigated, tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) stands out for its favorable direct band gap (∼2.1 eV), suitable band edge alignments, and earth-abundance.3,4 However, pristine Ta3N5 suffers from fast carrier recombination (<10 ps), resulting from its poor electrical mobility, typically <4 cm2 V−1 s−1,5 and thus leading to a high onset potential at 0.8–1.1 V versus RHE instead of the expected onset at approximately 0 V versus RHE.6,7 Therefore, an effective strategy for improving the charge transport properties of Ta3N5, is highly desirable but still challenging.8
The built-in electric field in the depletion region is an important route to spatially separate the photogenerated charges in a semiconductor.9 It is well documented that a staggered (type II) heterojunction between two semiconductors can generally create a built-in electric field at their interface to effectively separate the charges.10 In addition, coupling of two semiconductors to form a heterojunction can compensate for the disadvantages of the single component, and induce a synergistic effect.11 Type-II heterojunction photoanodes, such as BiVO4/WO3,11,12 CaFe2O4/TaON,13 BiVO4/ZnO,14 and TiO2/Fe2O3,15 have been developed and shown good performance in PEC water splitting. It is, however, challenging to seek materials with a properly aligned band position for constructing type II heterojunction photoanodes.10 In addition, although many efforts were made to ensure intimate interfacial contact of two semiconductors, to prepare the nitride heterojunction is still challenging due to their thermal instability.16–18
Given that the conduction-valence band levels between tantalum oxynitride (TaON) and Ta3N5 match well,18 it is feasible to pair TaON with Ta3N5 for heterojunction construction. Particularly, benefiting from the outstanding charge transport capability of TaON, its photocurrent onset is as negative as 0.2 V versus RHE.19,20 The theoretical STH efficiency of TaON is limited to ca. 6.5% under standard AM 1.5G solar light illumination because of its band gap of 2.5 eV. Hence, it would provide a dramatic advantage to combine the long-wavelength absorption of Ta3N5 and the low onset potential of TaON. In addition, the valence band of TaON is more positive than that of Ta3N5 due to hybridization of the N 2p and O 2p orbitals, and the conduction band level of Ta3N5 is slightly negative compared to that of TaON, suggesting that hole migration from TaON to Ta3N5 and electron transfer from Ta3N5 to TaON are possible in thermodynamics,18,21 thus reducing charge recombination. Therefore, constructing the TaON/Ta3N5 junction composite should be, in theory, a possible alternative to achieving highly efficient PEC water splitting.
Here, our goal was therefore to realize a heterojunction concept based on a TaON/Ta3N5 electrode for PEC water splitting. The TaON and Ta3N5 particle layers were deposited in turn using an electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate and subsequently annealed in flowing NH3 to create a junction. We found that TaON served as the partner of the heterojunction electrode to help transport the electrons. By optimizing the thickness of the TaON layer, our TaON/Ta3N5 heterojunction photoanode without employing any co-catalyst achieved a 350 mV negative shift of photocurrent onset potential compared to pristine Ta3N5 photoanode. This can be attributed to the optimal heterojunction-structure design, in which Ta3N5 and TaON harvest solar energy and transfer charge in a complementary manner, leading to the enhancement of PEC performance.
Experimental section
TaON and Ta3N5 synthesis
The TaON powders were prepared according to our previous report.19 Briefly, 0.2 g Ta2O5 (99.99%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd) were heated in a tube furnace (total heating region of 12 cm, 1100 °C maximum) with a fused silica tube (inside diameter 5.0 cm, length 100 cm) at 1000 °C for 15 h. During the nitridation process, H2O vapor was introduced into the oven via a water saturated flow of NH3 gas (500 mL min−1). Ta3N5 powders were prepared by continuously flowing 500 mL min−1 NH3 over a crucible containing 0.5 g of Ta2O5 in the tube furnace at 850 °C for 15 hours. Both TaON and Ta3N5 were naturally cooled to room temperature under a stream of NH3.
Preparation of the TaON/Ta3N5 heterojunction photoanodes
The heterojunction photoanode was prepared using a facile electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method twice: A TaON layer was first deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/glass substrate, with subsequent deposition of the Ta3N5 layer, resulting in the formation of a sandwich structure of FTO/TaON/Ta3N5 and the TaON layer in the middle. Typically, TaON or Ta3N5 powder (40 mg) was dispersed in anhydrous acetone solution (50 mL) containing iodine (10 mg, Sigma-Aldrich, >99.8%), followed by sonication for 10 min. Then, both the EPD processes for TaON and Ta3N5 were conducted between two FTO electrodes that were immersed in parallel in the solution with a distance of 1 cm under 15 V of bias using a DC power supply. The film-coated area was controlled to be 1 × 1 cm, followed by a TaCl5 necking treatment as described in a previous report. 10 mM of TaCl5 methanol solution (50 μL) was added dropwise onto the as-prepared electrode,20,22 and then dried; the electrode was then annealed at 450 °C for 1 h under a NH3 gas flow (500 mL min−1), leading to the formation of a junction, with good reproducibility. The thicknesses of the TaON and Ta3N5 layers were controlled by varying the time of the EPD step. The optimized TaON and Ta3N5 layers in our study were deposited at 15 V for 2 min and 15 V for 3 min with the film thicknesses of approximately 4 and 3 μm, respectively. In this paper, we denote the prepared heterojunction photoanode as TaON(x)/Ta3N5(3 μm), where x indicates the thickness (μm) of the TaON layer. As a reference, bare TaON and Ta3N5 powders were mechanically mixed at a TaON/Ta3N5 mass ratio of 1, and then deposited on FTO followed by necking under the same conditions except for EPD time for controlling the same thickness, which was denoted as TaON/Ta3N5 (mix). Additionally, bare TaON and Ta3N5 photoanodes were also prepared under the same conditions for comparison. The use of TaON and Ta3N5 powders for TaON (1 μm), TaON (4 μm), TaON (6 μm) and Ta3N5 (3 μm) photoanodes was determined by weighing and is found to be about 0.07, 0.28, 0.40 and 0.52 mg, respectively.
Photoelectrochemical testing
PEC characterization of the photoanodes was carried out with a three-electrode system composed of a Pt counter-electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode under simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) using an Oriel 92251A-1000 sunlight simulator. Before measurement, the solar simulator intensity was calibrated with a standard Newport 91150 silicon cell. The illuminated area of the working electrode was 0.28 cm2, defined by a mask. A 1 M NaOH solution (pH 13.6) was used as the electrolyte. Before the PEC measurement, the electrolyte was deaerated by nitrogen purging to remove the dissolved oxygen. For a typical current–potential measurement, a potential scan rate of 30 mV s−1 was used and the potentials were converted to those of the RHE according to the Nernst equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.197, where EAg/AgCl is the applied bias potential and 0.197 V is the reference potential of Ag/AgCl with respect to the RHE scale. The IPCE can be calculated using the equation (IPCE = (1240 × (Jlight − Jdark)/(λ × Plight))), where Jlight and Jdark are the measured photocurrent and dark current density (mA cm−2), respectively, λ is the wavelength of the incident light (nm) and Plight is the light intensity at the specific measurement wavelength (W m−2). The reaction was carried out under irradiation using a 500 W Xe lamp equipped with bandpass filters to provide monochromatic irradiation. The incident light intensity was measured using a photometer (Newport, 840-C, USA). The charge separation efficiency (Øsep) was determined by adding a fast hole scavenger (0.1 M H2O2) to the electrolyte, and can be calculated from the current–potential curves using the equation (JNa2SO3 = Jabs × Øsep × Øinj), where JNa2SO3 is the measured photocurrent density and Øinj is the charge injection efficiency. Jabs is the theoretical photocurrent of 11.5 mA cm−2, calculated from the spectrum of AM 1.5 G and absorption spectrum. Since the rate of charge transfer to the electrolyte by the oxidation of H2O2 at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface was very fast, it could be assumed that the surface recombination of charges was eliminated and Øinj ≈ 100%. Thus, Øsep = JNa2SO3/11.6. All experiments were repeated at least 3 times, with error less than 10%.
Materials characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted with a Rigaku Ultima III X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) and a scan rate of 10° min−1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, FEI, USA) operating at 15 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEOL JEM 2100F microscope at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. The optical properties of samples were determined on a UV-vis spectrometer (UV-2500 PC, Shimadzu Corp., Japan) equipped with an integrating sphere. The absorption spectra of the films were obtained by measuring the transmittance (T) and reflectance (R) spectra. A standard BaSO4 white plate was used as the 100% reflectance reference. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were converted from the reflection to absorption mode by the Kubelka–Munk function. The Mott–Schottky (M–S) curves were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (2273, Princeton Applied Research, AMETEK) by performing a potential scan in the anodic direction under a frequency of 1 kHz and an AC amplitude of 15 mV in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded using an electrochemical analyzer (Solartron 1260 + 1287). The Nyquist plots were measured in 1 M NaOH electrolyte at 0.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl with an AC amplitude of 15 mV, and frequencies of 0.1 Hz and 100 kHz under 500 W Xe lamp irradiation.
Results and discussion
Ta3N5 and TaON powders were prepared by continuously flowing ammonia at high temperatures. As expected, X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealed that well-crystallized, phase-pure orthorhombic Ta3N5 and monoclinic TaON were obtained (Fig. 1a). The diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the two samples are shown in Fig. 1b. TaON and Ta3N5 exhibit clear absorption edges around 530 nm and 600 nm, respectively. Accordingly, the band gap was calculated using the Tauc plot method (Fig. S1, ESI†) to be 2.08 eV for Ta3N5 and 2.36 eV for TaON, in good agreement with the reported results.3,19,22 The morphologies of the as-prepared TaON, Ta3N5, and TaON/Ta3N5 electrodes were visualized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ta3N5 showed the morphology of a typically sintered particle with an apparent particle size of around 1 μm, which resulted from the agglomeration of 100–200 nm nanoparticles (Fig. 2a). And TaON exhibited a dispersed particle morphology with diameters of 300–500 nm (Fig. 2b). The cross-sectional SEM image of Ta3N5 and TaON electrodes showed a uniformly deposited Ta3N5 layer of about ∼3 μm thickness and a TaON layer of about ∼4 μm thickness with interparticle pores as presented in Fig. 2c and d. In the case of the TaON/Ta3N5 electrode, the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 2e) reveals that a double-layer of TaON (∼4 μm) and Ta3N5 (∼3 μm) with the initial morphology was formed on the FTO substrate, and the layer of Ta3N5 was in intimate contact with the TaON layer, which is important for the proposed fast charge transfer between them. The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) lattice image (Fig. 2f) showed that the lattice fringes of 0.193 nm and 0.512 nm correspond to the (200) and (020) facets of orthorhombic Ta3N5, respectively. And the 0.176 nm lattice fringe was assigned to the (220) facets of monoclinic TaON. Clearly, a smooth interface between Ta3N5 and TaON was observed, and the TaCl5-treated layer between Ta3N5 and TaON was hard to see in the HR-TEM image, clearly identifying the formation of a TaON/Ta3N5 heterojunction.13

The PEC performance of a Ta3N5 (∼3 μm)/TaON (∼4 μm) photoanode was compared with those of the bare Ta3N5 and TaON photoanodes by measuring the current density–voltage (J–V) curve through back (FTO) side illumination. As we know, light absorption and charge transport are greatly sensitive to the film thickness of the photoanode. An approximately 3 μm thick Ta3N5 layer was chosen because it was the optimal structure for the best performance in the case of sintered Ta3N5.23 In this condition, Ta3N5 was moderately rearranged into a uniform film consisting of an average of three rows of particles (see Fig. 2c). A thicker Ta3N5 layer would increase the likelihood of charge recombination due to the poor charge transfer of Ta3N5, leading to a detrimental effect on the photocurrent. The TaON/Ta3N5 photoanode was accordingly optimized by varying the thickness of the TaON layer with a constant 3 μm Ta3N5 layer. Notably, we observed that the photocurrent of TaON/Ta3N5 was dependent on the thickness of the TaON layer (Fig. S2, ESI†), implying that electron collection from TaON to FTO can be another crucial factor in determining the PEC performance. Depositing a TaON layer with film thickness below 4 μm, apparently increasing the photocurrent with thickening of the TaON layer can be explained by the fact that thin TaON layers are almost insufficient to entirely cover with the interface of Ta3N5 particles. The highest photocurrent, ∼1.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE, was obtained when the electrode was constructed of a 4 μm TaON layer and 3 μm Ta3N5 layer. The photocurrent of the TaON/Ta3N5 heterojunction photoanode is evidently higher than those of the individual TaON (4 μm film thickness, ∼1.1 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE) or Ta3N5 (3 μm film thickness, ∼0.6 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE) photoanodes (Fig. 3a). No further increase in photocurrent was detected when the deposition thickness of the TaON layer was above ∼4 μm (Fig. S2, ESI†), indicating that a TaON layer with 4 μm thickness is a trade-off between the sufficient heterojunction interface and the charge carrier transfer to the FTO surface. More interestingly, the onset potential of the TaON/Ta3N5 photoanode was negatively shifted to 0.65 V versus RHE (photocurrent onset potential measured at 0.2 mA cm−2 according to ref. 4 and 24), which is about 350 and 100 mV lower than those of Ta3N5 and TaON, respectively (Fig. 3b). The reduction of require bias is significant because it is quite close to what has been achieved by coating oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for improving the water oxidation kinetics.25,26 Thus, the PEC performance of Ta3N5 was increased by coupling with TaON forming the heterojunction composite photoanode of appropriate compositions.

(c) IPCE dependence on the wavelength and (d) absorption spectra of Ta3N5, TaON, and TaON/Ta3N5 heterojunction photoanodes. 
Next, we systematically explored the reasons for the excellent performance of the TaON/Ta3N5 heterojunction photoanode. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was recorded under the bias potential of 1.23 V versus RHE in order to ascertain the light conversion efficiency. As shown in Fig. 3c, the increase in the IPCE of bare Ta3N5 from ∼600 nm and TaON from ∼530 nm is in agreement with their optical absorption edges shown in Fig. 1b. In the case of the TaON/Ta3N5 photoanode, all the IPCEs in the wide wavelength range (from 380–600 nm) are significantly higher than that of bare Ta3N5, indicating that coupling of the Ta3N5 and TaON layers could enhance the solar light conversion efficiency. The light harvesting efficiencies of the TaON/Ta3N5, Ta3N5 and TaON electrodes were determined by the absorption spectra that were calculated from the formula, absorption = 1 − transmittance − reflectance. As shown in Fig. 3d, the absorption spectra of the FTO/TaON/Ta3N5 and FTO/Ta3N5 photoanodes closely resemble that of bare Ta3N5 with absorption onset at around 600 nm. The larger absorbance for FTO/TaON/Ta3N5 in comparison with FTO/TaON in the region of 300–530 nm indicates that the more efficient photon utilization was enabled by the Ta3N5 outer layer, which absorbs the remaining light below 530 nm that penetrates through the TaON layer and extends the absorption edge up to 600 nm; therefore, the efficient and wide light absorption by the TaON/Ta3N5 electrode mainly originated from the Ta3N5 layer. On the other hand, the TaON/Ta3N5 and Ta3N5 electrodes exhibited comparable light absorption over the whole region, suggesting that the observed performance enhancements were not attributable to the change of light absorption.
Then, we used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to quantitatively evaluate the kinetics of charge transfer of Ta3N5 coupling with and without TaON. The Nyquist plots can be fitted with the Randle equivalent circuit model (inset of Fig. 4a).11 In this model, the element Rs is the whole series resistance in the electrochemical cell and Rct and Cct are related to the charge transfer resistance and capacitance at the electrolyte/photoelectrode interface, respectively. The fitted values of Rct were ∼1319, ∼1654, and ∼5138 Ω for bare TaON, TaON/Ta3N5, and bare Ta3N5 photoanodes, respectively. Thus, bare TaON has a very good efficiency of charge transport showing the lowest Rct. The Rct values of TaON/Ta3N5 are only slightly larger than that of bare TaON and significantly smaller compared to that of bare Ta3N5, indicating that the interfacial charge transfer rate of the Ta3N5 photoanode is improved after coupling with the TaON layer. However, only a slight cathodic shift of onset potential for the photoanode prepared by directly mixing the Ta3N5 and TaON particles under identical conditions to those used for the Ta3N5 photoanode, as shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), confirms that the onset potential improvement did not result from a simple combination of Ta3N5 and TaON.

(c) Transient photocurrent decay under illumination at an applied potential of 1.23 V versus RHE. (d) Decay times of transient photocurrents of the Ta3N5 and TaON/Ta3N5 heterojunction photoanodes. 
We therefore hypothesize that the improvement in the PEC performance shown in Fig. 3a is a result of the construction of the heterojunction of Ta3N5 and TaON, which creates a built-in electric field and combines the advantages of each component in the good light absorption capability of Ta3N5 and excellent charge transport characteristics of TaON. The net effect is greater charge separation efficiency (ηsep) in the bulk of TaON/Ta3N5 than the bare Ta3N5 photoanode, which could be measured by adding 0.5 M H2O2 to the electrolyte as a hole scavenger. As expected from Fig. 4b, the ηsep of the TaON/Ta3N5 heterojunction is significantly higher than that of bare Ta3N5 and the difference in ηsep is quantitatively consistent with the photocurrent and IPCE results (Fig. 3a and c). Another technique to help us to see the existence of the built-in electric field relies on how the built-in electric field at the heterojunction interface affects charge recombination kinetics. Thus, a transient photocurrent decay measurement was carried out. As shown in Fig. 4c, sharp current spikes were observed under sudden illumination due to the capacitive charging, followed by an immediate photocurrent decay process. The transient photocurrent decay gives the information of the recombination of holes trapped at the surface with electrons in the depletion layer.27 A lower recombination rate could be reflected by longer transient decay times. Using the methodology developed by P. Salvador et al.,28 the average transient decay time can be approximately calculated by a logarithmic plot of parameter D, using the equation D = (Jt − Js)/(Jm − Js), where Jt is the photocurrent at time t, Js is the steady state photocurrent, and Jm is the photocurrent spike. To obtain a qualitative relative comparison, the transient decay time, τ, can be defined as the time at which lnD = −1. We see from the Fig. 4d that the transient decay time for TaON/Ta3N5 was longer than that for bare Ta3N5, indicating that the TaON layer assists the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges, which were attributed to the formation of the heterojunction.
To confirm the thermodynamic feasibility of spatial charge transfer in the FTO/TaON/Ta3N5 heterojunction photoanode, the band positions of Ta3N5 and TaON were predicted theoretically from the Mott–Schottky (M–S) measurement and UV-Vis results. In Fig. S5, ESI,† both the samples exhibited positive slopes in the linear M–S region, suggesting that they are n-type conductive semiconductors. The Ufb of TaON and Ta3N5 was respectively determined by the intercept of the tangent line of the M–S relationship on the potential axis to be ca. 0.14 V and 0.09 V versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). It is well known that the bottom of the conduction band (CB) of n-type semiconductors is more negative by ca. 0.2 V than the flat band potential;29,30 so the CB positions of n-type TaON and Ta3N5 are estimated to be −0.06 eV and −0.11 eV, respectively. According to Eg = EVB − ECB (Eg: semiconductor band gap; EVB: the valence band edge potential; and ECB: the conduction band edge potential), EVB was calculated to be +2.3 eV for TaON and +1.97 eV for Ta3N5. By combining their band gaps calculated from the Tauc plots (Fig. S1, ESI†), the relative band alignment between TaON and Ta3N5 can be obtained as shown in Scheme 1, which is in agreement with previous reports.18,22 With this typical type-II heterojunction structure, the excited electrons are expected to transfer from the CB of Ta3N5 to that of TaON easily due to the potential difference, and then the excited and migrated electrons in TaON are collected onto FTO, while the photogenerated holes will transfer in an opposite way, leading to spatial charge separation and reducing the chance of recombination. The reduced recombination would naturally induce PEC performance enhancement. By contrast, we also prepared a TaON/Ta3N5/FTO reverse heterojunction photoanode in which the Ta3N5 layer is now closest to the FTO substrate. In this case, the built-in electric field is present in the opposite direction and should act as a barrier for carrier separation.10 As shown in Fig. S6, ESI,† the photocurrent indeed decreases and is even lower than that of bare Ta3N5, further supporting the conclusion that the proposed mechanism shown in Scheme 1 is reasonable.

According to the above discussions, the remarkable cathodic shift of photocurrent onset potential for the TaON/Ta3N5 heterojunction photoanode should be ascribed to the following aspects: (1) the heterojunction can form a built-in electric field in the depletion region, resulting in fast electron–hole separation to effectively minimize the energy-wasteful electron–hole recombination and facilitate the charge transfer efficiency, which is extremely beneficial to the photoactivity of water oxidation. (2) In heterojunction electrodes, the photogenerated electrons in Ta3N5 are transferred to the TaON layers with good charge transport characteristics and contribute to the higher charge separation efficiency. Owing to these synergistic effects, the onset potential of the TaON/Ta3N5 photoanode was negatively shifted to 0.65 V versus RHE, without any co-catalysts.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have fabricated a TaON/Ta3N5 heterojunction photoanode on an FTO substrate by the electrophoretic deposition of two semiconductor powders. Such structures combine the merits of each component, light harvesting capability of Ta3N5 and charge transfer properties of TaON, and thereby contribute to the improved photoactivity for water oxidation compared to individual Ta3N5 and TaON. Importantly, without the need for any co-catalyst, the photoanode with the optimal composition achieves an onset potential of 0.65 V versus RHE under simulated AM 1.5G illumination, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art TaON photoanodes for PEC water splitting systems. These results point out a promising direction for improving the PEC performance of Ta3N5 and other (oxy)nitride semiconductors by directly creating a heterojunction with each other toward high efficiency water splitting.
