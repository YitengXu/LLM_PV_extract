    , Accepted 28th March 2019First published on 28th March 2019AbstractBioproduction processes relying on natural photosynthesis have low solar energy-to-specific product conversion efficiency. A possible solution is the development of hybrid photosynthesis systems where sunlight is harvested by more efficient inorganic devices, which then generate energy used by microbial catalysts for the production of valuable chemicals from carbon dioxide. Microbial processes employing organic carbon molecules as a source of energy could also benefit from being coupled with inorganic photocatalysts to drive their metabolism toward a higher production yield. Here, the photocatalyst graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was employed to improve polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production from fructose by Ralstonia eutropha H16. PHB is a bioplastic generated by R. eutropha for energy and carbon storage purposes. Its synthesis requires reducing power in the form of NADPH. In this hybrid photosynthesis strategy, g-C3N4 harvested light energy and generated reducing power, which were then consumed by R. eutropha for the conversion of acetyl-CoA into PHB. Coupling illuminated R. eutropha with g-C3N4 augmented PHB production by 1.2 times in the absence of a sacrificial electron donor and by 1.4 times when triethanolamine was supplied. The formation of large aggregates composed of cells and photocatalyst particles was observed with SEM, indicating that direct physical contact between g-C3N4 and R. eutropha is required for the effective transfer of reducing power. The significantly increased ratio of intracellular NADPH/NADP+ further demonstrated the positive impact of g-C3N4 on R. eutropha energy metabolism. This proof-of-concept study illustrates that inorganic photocatalysts can augment the productivity of white biotechnologies aiming at converting organic carbon substrates into useful chemicals.
1. Introduction
Many bioproduction processes are dependent on natural photosynthesis. Photosynthetic microbes use sunlight to drive their metabolism for the synthesis of chemicals of interest.1–3 Non-photosynthetic microbes can harvest energy via oxidation or fermentation of photosynthetic biomass.4–6 The light energy-to-specific chemicals efficiency of these processes is usually low.7 For example, only 0.2% of sunlight energy ended up in ethanol molecules during sugarcane fermentation.8 Artificial photosynthesis, which involved photoelectrochemical cells, photovoltaic apparatuses or photocatalysts, is significantly more efficient than natural photosynthesis for light conversion to chemical energy.9–12 However, when it comes to the production of carbon-based products, most artificial photosynthesis systems can only synthesize C1 compounds.13,14
Recently, a hybrid photosynthesis approach was developed where inorganic light absorbers can transfer reducing equivalents to microbial catalysts.8 This strategy harnesses the metabolic potential of microbes for the production of a wide range of multicarbon products as well as the higher efficiency of inorganic light energy capture devices.9,15,16 Until now, reported hybrid photosynthesis studies have mainly focused on describing microbial systems aiming at light-driven CO2 reduction coupling photoelectrodes, solid-state photovoltaics or CdS photocatalyst particles with autotrophic bacteria or archaea.17–23 Among these systems, the combination of a microbial catalyst with photocatalysts is the simplest and possibly less expensive to implement since it only required a single reactor without photoelectrodes, photovoltaics and electrolyzers.
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a metal-free polymeric semiconductor with several properties that would be well suited for hybrid photosynthesis. It has a bandgap of 2.7 eV with a conduction band at −1.1 eV and a valence band at −1.6 eV versus the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).24 Consequently, g-C3N4 can be employed as a photocatalyst for visible light-driven H2 evolution.25 Pure or composite g-C3N4 has also been used for light-driven organic pollutant degradation, heavy metal removal and CO2 reduction into other C1 compounds.26–28 Other important characteristics of g-C3N4 include low synthesis cost compared to metal-based photocatalysts, good biocompatibility, high chemical and thermal stability and high specific surface area.29–31

Ralstonia eutropha H16 is a facultative chemolithoautotrophic Gram-negative bacterium also known as Cupriavidus necator H16. R. eutropha has a versatile metabolism enabling it to grow heterotrophically with different organic carbon molecules as well as autotrophically with H2, CO2 and O2.32–35R. eutropha metabolism can also be driven electrochemically.19,36–38 One of the most interesting characteristics of R. eutropha is that it can produce and store intracellularly a significant amount of the biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) when carbon is in excess and other nutrients are limited.32 Additionally, R. eutropha can readily be modified genetically for the production of other compounds than PHB such as alcohols, methyl ketones, fatty acids and alkenes.39–44
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) such as PHB have been considered as a biodegradable and biocompatible alternative to plastics synthesized from petroleum.45 PHAs are water-insoluble, non-toxic, elastomeric and piezoelectric, which make these materials suitable for a wide range of applications in the food industry, for paint production, in medicine and pharmacy, in agriculture and in the packaging industry.46 However, high cost compared to petroleum-based plastics has stymied the development of commercial production of PHB. Carbon substrates such as fructose used for PHB production by R. eutropha account for nearly half of the total production cost.47 These costs could be reduced by employing less expensive carbon substrates or by developing novel strategies to augment product yield.48–51
The main objective of the study presented here is to demonstrate that hybrid photosynthesis can be employed to improve the production yield of heterotrophic bioprocesses. Visible light-harvesting g-C3N4 was coupled with illuminated R. eutropha cells growing on fructose and PHB production was monitored. Impact of the sacrificial electron donor triethanolamine (TEOA) on PHB production by the hybrid photosynthesis system designed here was assessed. Nature of the interaction between g-C3N4 and R. eutropha cells was examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The intracellular NADPH/NADP+ ratio was investigated to evaluate the impact of reducing equivalent transfer by the photocatalysts on the bacterial cell energy metabolism.
2. Experimental
2.1 Strain and growth medium

R. eutropha H16 (DSM-428) was used for this study. The bacterium was maintained aerobically at 30 °C in dextrose-free tryptic soy broth (TSB) medium. Hybrid photosynthesis experiments were conducted in nitrogen-limiting minimal medium.52 The minimal medium contains 1 ml l−1 trace element solution, 20 g l−1 fructose, 1 g l−1 NH4Cl, 5.2 g l−1 NaH2PO4·2H2O, 11.6 g l−1 Na2HPO4·12H2O, 0.45 g l−1 K2SO4, 0.8 g MgSO4·7H2O and 0.08 g CaCl2·2H2O. The trace element solution contains 0.1 M HCl, 15 g l−1 FeSO4·7H2O, 2.4 g l−1 MnSO4·H2O, 2.4 g l−1 ZnSO4·7H2O and 0.48 g l−1 CuSO4·5H2O. Unless stated otherwise, the pH of the nitrogen-limiting minimal medium was 6.8. Where indicated, R. eutropha was grown under illumination by using an LED light set at an intensity of 4200 lux.
2.2 g-C3N4 synthesis
g-C3N4 was synthesized from urea by the heat treatment process as described previously.53 Briefly, 10 g urea placed in an alumina crucible was calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for two hours using a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. After calcination, bulk g-C3N4 was washed three times with 20 ml 0.1 M HNO3 and 20 ml Milli-Q water in alternance to remove residual alkaline species adsorbed on the sample surface. g-C3N4 was dried at 55 °C for 24 h in air and then ground into a uniform powder.
2.3 H2 evolution activity of g-C3N4
Photocatalytic H2 evolution studies were carried out in 120 mL rubber stopper-sealed serum bottles. 10 mg g-C3N4 powder was dispersed in 20 mL Milli-Q water, minimal medium with fructose or minimal medium without fructose. Where indicated, TEOA was added as a sacrificial electron donor. TEOA was selected because it has been shown to be better than other sacrificial electron donors at driving the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4.54 Prior to illumination under the LED light set at 4200 lux, g-C3N4 suspension was flushed with pure N2 gas for 15 minutes. Bottles were then incubated for five minutes at 30 °C in the dark. At time 0, light was turned on and H2 evolution was monitored over a period of four hours with a GC9720 Plus gas chromatograph (FULI, China) equipped with a 5A molecular sieve column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
2.4 
          R. eutropha cultivation with g-C3N4 and PHB measurement
For the hybrid photosynthesis experiments, R. eutropha cultures pre-grown in minimal medium were used to inoculate Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml minimal medium with fructose at an initial OD600 of 0.05 in the presence of 0.2–1g-C3N4. Where indicated, TEOA was also added. Inoculated flasks were incubated at 30 °C with agitation. At time 0, light was turned on and PHB production as well as fructose consumption was monitored for a 96 hour period.

R. eutropha growth was monitored with an Evolution 220 UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). Fructose concentration was measured with a high-performance liquid chromatography 1260 Infinity system (Agilent, CA, USA) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H anion exchange column (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) set at a temperature of 35 °C. The mobile phase was 0.008 N H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min−1.
PHB was extracted and measured as described before.55 Briefly, 10 ml of PHB-containing samples were centrifuged at 7000g for 10 minutes at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed twice with distilled water, and dried overnight at 55 °C. Samples were then mixed with 2 ml methanol acidified with 3% H2SO4 and 2 ml chloroform. Reactions were heated in screw-capped glass tubes at 100 °C for 4 hours. After cooling to room temperature, 1 ml distilled water was added to the tubes, which were then shaken vigorously for 1 minute. After phase separation, the organic phase was removed and transferred to a small screw-cap glass vial. PHB extracted in the organic phase was measured with a GC9720 gas chromatograph (Fuli, China) equipped with a RB-FFAP column and a flame ionization detector (FID), with an initial temperature of 50 °C for 2 min and a final temperature of 220 °C for 2 min with a temperature increase rate of 10 °C min−1.
2.5 Analytical and biochemical methods
For the characterization of g-C3N4, the crystalline phase of the sample was examined with a D8 ADVANCE powder X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, MA, USA) equipped with Cu Kα X-ray. The Fourier transform infrared spectrum was recorded with a Nicolet iS5 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using the KBr pellet method with a 0.8 cm−1 resolution in the 400–4000 cm−1 range. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectrum was recorded from a dry-pressed disk sample with the UV-2550 UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). BaSO4 was used as a reflectance standard.
The morphology of the prepared g-C3N4 powder was characterized by SEM with a Zeiss Ultra Plus scanning electron microscope (Germany) at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. For SEM of R. eutropha cells, samples cultivated for 24 hours were collected and fixed overnight at 4 °C in a 0.1 M Na phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Samples were then washed serially with 30%, 50%, 70%, 80% and 90% ethanol. Subsequently, samples were washed two times with 100% ethanol. After resuspension in 100% ethanol, the samples were dropped on a silicon wafer and air-dried. Samples were scanned at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV.
For the NADPH/NADP+ ratio measurement, 225 μl R. eutropha cell samples were snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen after 96 hours of growth to stop the metabolism. After thawing, NADPH and NADP+ concentrations were measured with the coenzyme II NADPH content assay kit (Solarbio Life Sciences, China) as per the instructions of the manufacturer.
2.6 Yield and quantum efficiency calculation for PHB
The yield of PHB to fructose: (1)
Quantum efficiency (QE)56,57 was calculated with electrons in NADPH required for PHB synthesis from acetoacetyl-CoA divided by incident photons. PHB moles after 96 hours in the control experiment without g-C3N4 and TEOA were subtracted from PHB moles in experiments with 0.2–1g-C3N4 and 5TEOA. Each PHB mole corresponds to one mole of NADPH + H+, which carries two moles of electrons (Fig. 2A). Moles of incident photons correspond to the quantity of photons striking the surface of g-C3N4 after 96 hours. (2) NADP+ + 2e− + 2H+ = NADPH + H+(3) (4)
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation and characterization of g-C3N4
g-C3N4 was prepared from urea by the heat treatment process.53 Two distinct diffraction peaks associated with g-C3N4 were observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 1A). The most intense diffraction peak at 27.6° (peak 2) corresponds to the interlayer stacking of aromatic segments in g-C3N4 and the minor peak at 13.2° (peak 1) is attributed to tri-s-triazine units packing in the lattice planes parallel to the c axis.58–60 The Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FT-IR) analysis was also characteristic of g-C3N4 (Fig. 1B). Skeletal vibrations in the 1200–1650 cm−1 region for aromatic C–N heterocycles as well as a breathing vibration at 812.1 cm−1 for tri-s-triazine units were detected. The broad absorption peak observed at 3000–3500 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching vibrational modes of the O–H or N–H groups.61,62

The light absorption property of g-C3N4 was assessed by UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (Fig. 1C). As expected, the visible light absorption upper limit of g-C3N4 was ca. 450 nm.63 The synthesized g-C3N4 had photocatalytic activity as demonstrated by the detection of a H2 evolution reaction (HER) in water when exposed to visible light (Fig. 1D; Table 1). Addition of the sacrificial electron donor TEOA accelerated the reaction significantly by 8.1 times.

3.2 Photo-augmented PHB production by R. eutropha with g-C3N4
The bacterium R. eutropha H16 produces and stores PHB when growing heterotrophically with fructose as the substrate.52 In all growth modes, PHB synthesis required reducing equivalents under the form of NADPH (Fig. 2A).64–67 We postulated that the photocatalyst g-C3N4 under light could transfer electrons to R. eutropha leading to an increase of its reducing capacity and of PHB production. R. eutropha was cultivated under light with fructose in the presence of g-C3N4 and TEOA. After 96 hours, PHB production was improved 1.4 times to 6.73 ± 0.45 g l−1 when 0.5 g l−1 g-C3N4 (0.5g-C3N4) and 5 g l−1 of the sacrificial electron donor TEOA (5TEOA) were added to the illuminated bacterial culture (Fig. 2B and C). In the dark, the addition of 0.5g-C3N4 and 5TEOA had no impact on PHB production demonstrating that the observed increase was light-dependent (Fig. 2D). When only 0.5g-C3N4 was added but no TEOA, PHB production was increased 1.2 times to 5.94 ± 0.25 g l−1, which indicated that the sacrificial electron donor was beneficial but not essential to improve this bioproduction process.

Scanning electron microscopy images showed that R. eutropha cells interacted directly with g-C3N4 by forming aggregates (Fig. 3). The bioinorganic photocatalyst structure formed by g-C3N4 and R. eutropha cells agglutinated together presented in Fig. 3 panel C is representative of the multiple aggregates that were observed by SEM during growth under light (Fig. S1†). The size of the observed aggregates after 24 hours of growth was 13.0 ± 2.0 μM × 6.5 ± 1.7 μM (n = 3) (Fig. S1†).

3.3 Impact of TEOA concentration on growth and PHB production
Although g-C3N4 alone was sufficient, the addition of 5TEOA or 20TEOA improved PHB production after 96 hours by 1.13 times (Fig. 2B and C). A higher TEOA concentration (100–200TEOA with g-C3N4 has been shown to result in a substantially faster light-dependent H2 evolution reaction than what is reported here.54,63 However, adding 20TEOA instead of 5TEOA in our study had no beneficial impact on the bacterial production of PHB. This could be explained by the inhibiting effect of TEOA on the growth of R. eutropha H16 (Fig. S2†). Slower growth as well as a lower final OD600 was already observed with 5TEOA. With a higher TEOA concentration, growth defects became more severe. When 100TEOA was added to the R. eutropha culture, the growth was completely inhibited.
3.4 Impact of g-C3N4 concentration on growth and PHB production
Augmenting the g-C3N4 concentration beyond 0.5 g l−1 to 0.7g-C3N4 and 1g-C3N4 did not change PHB production significantly (Fig. 4). When 0.2g-C3N4 was added with 5TEOA, PHB production was augmented 1.2 times, but it was still significantly lower when compared with 0.5g-C3N4.

Each curve and bar are the mean and standard deviation of three replicates. In panel B, * indicates that p-value is below 0.05. 
3.5 Effect of pH on PHB production by R. eutropha with g-C3N4
Initially, the stimulation of microbial PHB production under light by g-C3N4 was evaluated at pH 6.8 because it is considered to be the optimal pH for R. eutropha H16 growth.68 The impact of pH variation on the hybrid photosynthesis system described here was assessed by testing PHB production at pH ranging from 5.5 to 8.0 (Fig. S3†). Below pH 6.0, the productivity of the 0.5g-C3N4/R. eutropha hybrid photosynthesis system was significantly lower with or without 5TEOA. At pH 7.0 and 8.0, PHB production was not significantly different compared to pH 6.8 when 5TEOA was added to the growth medium. In the absence of 5TEOA, PHB production was 6.35 ± 0.05 g l−1 at pH 7.0, which is 6.9% higher than that at pH 6.8. This slight increase might be related to a higher photocatalytic activity by g-C3N4 or to a more efficient PHB metabolism by R. eutropha at pH 7.0.
3.6 g-C3N4 and the cellular energy metabolism
The production of PHB from the central metabolite acetyl-CoA required the reduction of acetoacetyl-CoA into (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA by the acetoacetyl-CoA reductase PhaB with concomitant NADPH oxidation (Fig. 2A).69 Increasing NADPH availability has been shown to improve PHB yield per gram of cell dry weight (CDW).70 Along with improving volumetric PHB production, g-C3N4 activity also increased significantly the PHB cellular content (Table 2). Therefore, the impact of light-driven photocatalysis by g-C3N4 on the intracellular NADPH/NADP+ ratio was evaluated (Fig. 5). R. eutropha grown under light with 0.5g-C3N4 and 5TEOA had a NADPH/NADP+ ratio of 1.38 ± 0.12, which was significantly higher than R. eutropha grown under light but without 0.5g-C3N4 or without both 0.5g-C3N4 and 5TEOA. Additionally, illuminated R. eutropha with 0.5g-C3N4 and 5TEOA had a significantly higher NADPH/NADP+ ratio than R. eutropha grown in the dark with the photocatalyst and the sacrificial electron donor. These results clearly showed that light-driven electron transfer from g-C3N4 to the bacteria had a positive impact on the reducing potential of the cells, leading to higher PHB production.

To measure quantum efficiency (QE), which is the ratio of incident photons converted into electrons used for PHB synthesis, we assume reducing equivalents transferred from g-C3N4 to bacteria entered mainly into the PHB synthesis pathway after acetyl-CoA synthesis via NADPH required for acetoacetyl-CoA reduction. For each mole of PHB produced from acetoacetyl-CoA, one mole of NADPH + H+ is required carrying two moles of electrons. When R. eutropha cells were grown with 0.5g-C3N4 and 5TEOA, QENADPH was the highest at 8.74 ± 0.70% (Table 2). Under the same experimental conditions, PHB to fructose yield (g/g) was 1.4 times higher than that of the R. eutropha culture grown without g-C3N4 and TEOA.
Besides augmenting R. eutropha capacity for acetoacetyl-CoA conversion to PHB, reducing equivalents provided by the photocatalyst may also increase the cell capacity for the recycling of the carbon dioxide molecules generated during the glycolysis of fructose and the subsequent tricarboxylic acid cycle (Fig. 2A). R. eutropha could recycle CO2via the Calvin–Benson–Bassham carbon reduction cycle, which also uses NADPH as the cofactor.71
3.7 Electron transfer between g-C3N4 and R. eutropha
Electrons from H2 generated by 0.5g-C3N4 with or without 5TEOA in abiotic growth medium with fructose account for only 0.74% and 0.16%, respectively, of the electrons stored in the extra PHB produced by R. eutropha under light (Table 1; Fig. 2C; Fig. S4†). This suggests that most of the electrons transferred from the photocatalyst to the microbial cells are not shuttled via abiotically generated H2.
Two electron transfer mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in a hybrid photosynthesis system where acetate production from CO2 by the acetogen Moorella thermoacetica is driven by the photocatalyst CdS.72 In the first pathway, electrons are transferred to membrane-bound H2-producing hydrogenases generating H2 that will be oxidized by H2-oxidizing hydrogenases to provide reducing equivalents for the central metabolism. In the second pathway, electrons are transferred to electron transport proteins that are not hydrogenases before being employed in reducing enzymatic reactions. Similar mechanisms may occur for electron transfer between g-C3N4 and R. eutropha cells. Another possibility is that when R. eutropha is in contact with g-C3N4, abiotically evolved H2 is readily oxidized by the cells and removed from the photocatalyst vicinity, thus accelerating H2 evolution.73 Further investigation is required to determine the electron transfer pathways between g-C3N4 and R. eutropha cells.
3.8 Catalytic interactions of R. eutropha with g-C3N4
Without a sacrificial electron donor such as TEOA, methanol and lactic acid, water splitting and concomitant H2 evolution by pure g-C3N4 under illumination is usually close to zero.54 Light-driven water splitting by g-C3N4 is thermodynamically feasible but is hindered by slow kinetics due to the absence of surface redox active sites.74 Here, only trace amounts of H2 were detected with 0.5g-C3N4 in the absence of TEOA in water or growth medium with fructose (Fig. 1D, Table 1, Fig. S4†). Still, the hybrid photosynthesis system designed here improved considerably PHB production by R. eutropha without a sacrificial electron donor. This observation could be attributed to the nature of the electron transfer mechanism between g-C3N4 and the bacteria, which may not depend on abiotic H2 generation by the photocatalysts. Other explanations might include the possibility that bacterial cells, which contain metalloenzymes, increase the number of redox active sites at the surface of the photocatalyst as well as the possibility that R. eutropha excretes organic compounds in the growth medium that could be used as sacrificial electron donors by g-C3N4.
4. Conclusions
It has been shown previously that the light-dependent generation of reducing equivalents by an inorganic photocatalyst can drive bacterial CO2 reduction.18,20,23 Here, it is demonstrated that photocatalysts can also be employed to improve the productivity of bacterial processes converting organic carbon compounds. Adding photocatalyst g-C3N4 with or without the sacrificial electron donor TEOA to an illuminated R. eutropha culture grown with fructose as the substrate resulted in a significant increase of PHB production. g-C3N4 formed aggregates with R. eutropha cells, which suggests that direct physical contact is necessary for energy transfer. The nature of the electron transfer mechanisms is not clear since only a small fraction of the electrons stored in PHB that were derived from photocatalysis by g-C3N4 came from abiotic H2 evolution. This hybrid photosynthesis approach could be adapted to any organic carbon-driven bioprocesses where the product synthesis required the microbial reduction reaction. For instance, the production of alcohol-based biofuels from sugars or the conversion of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol might be a good approach for coupling with inorganic photocatalysts. In conclusion, the strategy presented here is a promising option to utilize light energy and chemical energy from organic carbon molecules in a synergistic manner to increase production yield that can be achieved with microbial-based processes.
