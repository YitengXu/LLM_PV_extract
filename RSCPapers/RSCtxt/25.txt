    , Accepted 18th January 2017First published on 18th January 2017AbstractA novel hollow-structured CuO derived from chitosan-coated Cu/Cu2O composite hollow spheres was mass produced via a supramolecular hydrogel templating method and homogeneously co-doped with C and N. Evaluation of the as-produced co-doped CuO hollow spheres as anode materials for Li ion batteries showed that they had superior electrochemical properties.
Nanostructured transition metal oxides have conducting properties ranging from metallic to semiconducting and are used in a variety of novel advanced functional materials. Copper(II) oxides are used in numerous applications, including superconductors,1 gas sensors,2 antimicrobial agents,3 photocatalysis,4 CO oxidation,5 CO2 reduction,6 water oxidation,7,8 supercapacitors,9 solar cells,10 and batteries.11–20 The graphite anode materials currently available commercially for use in Li ion batteries do not meet our increasing demands for high-power sources as a result of insufficient capacity; transition metal oxides such as Fe3O4, Fe2O3, Co3O4, NiO, and CuO are, however, good candidates for next generation energy storage systems in portable electronics, electric vehicles, and hybrid electric vehicles.21,22 CuO has attracted much attention because of its widespread distribution, excellent electrical conductivity, low price, high physicochemical stability, non-toxicity, and high theoretical reversible capacity (up to 674 mA h g−1).23
The electrochemical performance of CuO mainly depends on its structure and electronic properties; it has a poor cycling performance due to the large volume expansion/retraction associated with the insertion and extraction of Li. Several effective strategies have been proposed to improve the cycling performance of CuO anodes by constructing CuO nanostructures, such as thin films,12 nanowires,14 hollow spheres, yolk–shell nanostructures,24 and nanoribbon arrays.13 The incorporation of CuO particles in a conductive matrix to form CuO/M nanocomposites—such as CuO/C derived from a Cu-based metal organic framework,25 CuO/graphene,15 CuO/carbon nanotubes,16,26 or hybrids with other metal oxides24—has also been proposed. These strategies have attempted to produce hollow structures with a large interior void space and a three-dimensional hollow architecture to provide efficient and rapid pathways for the transport of Li ions and electrons in Li ion batteries, in addition to short, solid-state diffusion lengths. The large volume expansion associated with the insertion of Li can be accommodated in the void spaces of the hollow structure, giving better results than those obtained with other structures such as nanorods and nanospheres.
It is still challenging to synthesize CuO-based composites with hollow nanostructures on a large scale27 and a universal and straightforward approach for the synthesis of hollow CuO composites with a controllable morphology and high uniformity is desirable. The development of a template strategy to craft a variety of hollow structures with precisely controlled dimensions and compositions is of great interest28 and template effects are an inevitable feature of supramolecular chemistry. It is now feasible to design suitable target compounds, define their assemblies and to control the morphology of the aggregates using our knowledge of supramolecular interactions. Gelators (such as metal ions) can be reduced and directed to self-assemble to form different types of metallic nanoscale assemblages of different sizes, shapes and morphologies.29–32 Hollow structures fabricated via supramolecular soft template methods are still rare, however.
We have developed a supramolecular hydrogel that is responsive to multiple stimuli based on the ultrafast cross-linking of transition metal ions and natural renewable biopolymers.33 This supramolecular hydrogel can provide a particular assemblage environment and templating effect for the controlled reduction and crystallization of transition metal ions (e.g. Ag+ and Cu2+), with the reaction usually taking place at temperatures as low as 50 °C.34 We report here the in situ reduction of Cu2+ in a supramolecular hydrogel and its self-assembly into Cu/Cu2O hollow composites at room temperature (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, S2, ESI†). The Cu/Cu2O hollow composites were easily transformed into CuO (denoted as CuO-500) while maintaining a good secondary particle morphology by simply calcining at 500 °C in air. The residual biopolymers were easily recycled and reused in subsequent experiments. More experiment details are available in the ESI.†
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the experiment and illustration of the cross-linking mechanism. 

Fig. 2a shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the Cu/Cu2O composites. The Cu/Cu2O composite has a microspherical shape with a diameter of c. 3 μm and the microspheres are assembled from many irregular nanoparticles. Elemental mapping of the Cu/Cu2O composite by energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) showed that Cu forms the main framework of this structure and the O, N, and C atoms are distributed uniformly with the Cu atoms (Fig. S3, ESI†). We analyzed the morphological differences in the deposited samples in the absence of chitosan (CS), without the formation of the supramolecular hydrogel, and at different concentrations of CS (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). The directed role of the supramolecular hydrogel was vital in this experiment and the CS chains, the Cu2+ ions, and an appropriate pH were required for gel formation.

Fig. 2b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Cu/Cu2O microspheres and the oxidized CuO-500 sample. The Cu/Cu2O microspheres showed sharp peaks of Cu (ICCD No. 04-0836) and relatively weak peaks of Cu2O (ICCD No. 65-3288), indicating the in situ reduction of Cu2+ by ascorbic acid. After treatment at 500 °C in air for 2 h, the characteristic peak of Cu disappeared and the characteristic peaks of CuO emerged (ICCD No. 48-1548), implying that the Cu and Cu2O had been transformed to CuO. The XRD, Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectra of the Cu/Cu2O microspheres and the oxidized samples at different temperatures further confirmed the gradual chemical transformation (Fig. S6 and Table S1, ESI†).

Fig. 2c shows the variation in the morphology of the Cu/Cu2O particles as they converted to CuO. The oxidation of Cu/Cu2O to CuO caused a transformation from highly polycrystalline and faceted nanoparticles to isotropic and spheroid nanoparticles. The inset of Fig. 2c shows a selectively crushed CuO-500 sphere, illustrating the hollow structure. We optimized the oxidation temperature and found that a low temperature (300 °C) resulted in insufficient oxidation and a high temperature (600 °C) caused the loss of C and crushing of the hollow structure (Fig. S7 and Table S2, ESI†).

Fig. 2d shows the results of thermogravimetric analysis; CS was carbonized and burned off and Cu was gradually oxidized by O2 as the temperature increased. The oxidation, carbonization, and decomposition of the CS component in O2 caused a weight loss in the Cu/Cu2O composites and the oxidation of the Cu species increased the mass of the composites. The CS was not completely burned off at 500 °C as it could be inserted into the Cu/Cu2O composites. Combining these results with the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (Fig. S8 and Table S3, ESI†), we concluded that C and N were successfully doped into the CuO-500.
The transmission electron microscopy images of CuO-500 (Fig. 3a and b) demonstrate the hollow structure of the microspheres. Lattice fringes were evident and corresponded to the interplanar spacing of the CuO(111) planes (0.23 nm). Elemental mapping using EDS coupled with HAADF/STEM (Fig. 3c–g) was used to investigate the distribution of Cu, O, N, and C in a single hollow sphere of CuO-500. The images show that these components, along with the N and C atoms, were distributed uniformly with the Cu and O atoms in the hollow sphere. The intensity of these elements was slightly higher at the rims of the spheres, confirming the formation of an inner hollow structure.

(c) HAADF/STEM image of a single CuO-500 nanoparticle. EDS elemental mapping of (d) Cu (green), (e) O (yellow), (f) N (orange), and (g) C (red) in the image shown in part (c). 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to study the reaction mechanism during electrochemical cycling (Fig. 4a). During the first cathodic scan, a prominent peak at c. 1.05 V was ascribed to a multistep electrochemical reaction, including the formation of an intermediate Cu2O phase and a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) associated with destruction of the structure.25,35 The subsequent cathodic cycles were clearly different from the first cycle, i.e. three peaks appeared at c. 2.15, 1.31, and 0.79 V, which corresponded to the reduction from CuO to an intermediate composite CuO phase, then to Cu2O followed by further decomposition to Cu and Li2O. During the anodic scan, two wide oxide peaks could be indexed to the reconversion to Cu2O and CuO.36 The cathodic and anodic peak currents increased gradually in the following five CV cycles, indicating an active electrode process and a high cyclability of the electrode.

(a) Cyclic voltammogram profile for the first five cycles; (b) selected charge–discharge voltage profiles at 100 mA g−1; (c) rate capabilities; and (d) cycle performance of CuO-500 at 500 mA g−1 after activation at 100 mA g−1 for 12 cycles. 
The electrochemical performance of the CuO-500 composite as an anode for Li ion batteries was investigated by galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 100 mA g−1 between 0.01 and 3 V. The large irreversibility of the initial cycle (Fig. S9a, ESI†) was mainly attributed to electrolyte decomposition and the formation of SEI films at a potential of c. 1.0 V, which was identical to the first cycle of the CV curves and was a similar phenomenon to that observed at other negative electrodes. Fig. 4b shows there were two distinct plateaus at c. 1.5 and 1.05 V during the discharge process and one obvious plateau at c. 2.5 V during the charge process. Unlike previously reported results,25,27,36 these plateaus became clearer and tended to overlap in the subsequent 100 discharge–charge processes and gave a better cycle performance for CuO-500, which is in agreement with the CV results.

Fig. 4c shows that the CuO-500 composite delivered reversible capacities of 672, 629, 567, 488, and 421 mA h g−1 at current densities of 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mA g−1, with a capacity retention ratio of 93.6, 84.38, 72.62, and 62.65% of that at 50 mA g−1. When the current density returned to 50 mA g−1, the capacity recovered completely to 788 mA h g−1 (recovery efficiency 117%), indicating that the conversion reaction between CuO and Cu had excellent reversibility. This also meant that cycling at high current densities hardly damaged the hollow structure of the electrodes, given that the capacity was restored within the applied current density. Such a good performance implies rapid charge transportation in addition to Li ion diffusion.
The electrochemical properties of different oxidized samples were also evaluated and the CuO-500 composite showed the best cycle performance and maintained a discharge capacity >791 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 for up to 100 cycles, whereas the other oxidized samples had a capacity <400 mA h g−1 (Fig. S9b, ESI†). We fabricated a battery with CuO-500 and activated it at a low current density for 12 cycles and then cycled it at a higher current density of 500 mA g−1. The battery maintained an excellent and stable capacity of 456 mA h g−1 even after 500 cycles (Fig. 4d). Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows that the conductivity improved with cycling, which explains the excellent cycle performance. These results unambiguously showed the excellent cycle performance of CuO-500 derived from our synthetic Cu/Cu2O composites.
The outstanding electrochemical performance of the CuO-500 composite may be attributed to its unique hollow structure. The CS was successfully grafted to the Cu/Cu2O particles during the in situ reduction and supramolecular hydrogel directed self-assembly process. This method formed a highly homogeneous distribution of the C and N dopants after the carbonization of CS. The C particles not only helped to provide a good electrical connection to the poorly conductive CuO particles and channels for fast electron transport, but also hindered the aggregation of the CuO nanoparticles.37 The unique hollow structure supplied a large void space, which accommodated the volume expansion of the CuO particles without changing the secondary particle size during insertion of Li. The C around the CuO particles reinforced the strength of the hollow structure and played an important part in preventing cracking of the electrode during the volume change process. This particular structure can maintain its original spherical morphology even after 500 cycles (Fig. S11, ESI†) and the evolution of the assembled particles to fibers and porous structures further confirmed the superiority of this structure. The assembled CuO particles decreased the electrode–electrolyte contact area and limited the majority of SEI formation to the outer secondary particle surface instead of on individual nanoparticles, thus increasing the stability of the SEI films.38
We have therefore developed an energy-efficient, sustainable, and simple method to fabricate Cu/Cu2O hollow microparticles doped with C and N via an in situ reduction and self-assembling strategy directed by a supramolecular gel at room temperature. This composite fully converted into CuO hollow spheres when annealed at 500 °C. As a result of the nano-assembled hollow structure, which prevented particle aggregation and improved the conductivity, as well as stabilizing the SEI films, the CuO-500 composites had an excellent cycling performance. The composites had a competitive stable discharge capacity of ≥430 mA h g−1 at a current density of 500 mA g−1, with a retention >90% after 500 cycles. This method provides a new generalizable technique for the synthesis of hollow nanostructures, which can be applied to various fields such as smart device technologies and energy storage systems.
