    , Accepted 4th March 2021First published on 5th March 2021AbstractA succession of erbium single-doped and erbium/ytterbium co-doped SrF2 nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated via a hydrothermal synthesis technique followed by high-temperature calcination. Structural, morphology, and element information of SrF2 NPs were explored using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) instruments. Under near-infrared (NIR) excitation, the SrF2:Er3+ NPs exhibit a prominent red emission peak (at 670 nm) as well as two oppositely faint green emission peaks (at 525 nm and 548 nm). The probable mechanism of the dominant red up-conversion luminescence (UCL) emission was systematically studied by UC emission spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and diffuse reflectance spectrum analyses. We used the energy gap law to estimate the probability of electronic transition, which determines the UCL emission route. The behavior of the R/G value (emission intensity of red to green ratio) and the slope n (the number of photons absorbed during the excitation process) reflected the existence of a highly efficient cross-relaxation (CR) effect during the UC process in the SrF2 system, so we can infer that the prominent red UCL emission is due to the CR effect among adjacent erbium atoms. After co-doping with ytterbium ions, the red UCL emission intensity is further enhanced. By comparing 2 mol% Er3+,5 mol% Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 samples with a similar composition without ytterbium doping, a red UCL emission intensity enhancement of about 200 times was observed. This increase is ascribed to the existence of effective energy transfer up-conversion (ETUC) from ytterbium to erbium, and the presence of a large absorption peak of ytterbium in the range of 830–1060 nm was observed in the diffuse reflectance spectrum, indicating that ytterbium's ability to absorb 980 nm photon energy is significantly stronger than erbium's. The strong red radiation obtained for erbium/ytterbium co-doped SrF2 NPs is expected to have potential application prospects in in vivo bio-imaging and photodynamic therapy.
1. Introduction
The interest in investigating the rare-earth doped UCNPs is unceasingly unabated, due to their prominent properties such as long lifetimes, weak cytotoxicity and photo-bleaching, minimal auto-fluorescence and NIR excitation.1–4 These intrinsic advantages further promote the diverse application of UCNPs in three-dimensional displays, solar cells, and especially in bio-imaging and photodynamic therapy.5–8 To avoid tissue absorption, reduce photo-induced tissue damage, and thereby improve imaging quality and photodynamic therapy efficiency at the deep tissue level, UCNPs are required to have some emission peaks located in the 650–1200 nm range, in other words, in the ‘biological tissue optical window’.9,10 As the most common UC sensitizer ions, erbium ions exhibit an emission peak in the red region, which corresponds to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition.11,12 Unfortunately, when it is doped in most hosts such as NaYF4,13 Y2O314 and so forth,15,16 the red emission peak is not prominent. Therefore, achieving a prominent red emission peak can endow UCNPs with great advantages in bio-applications.
Recently, some researchers have attempted to induce a CR effect by doping a high concentration of sensitizer ions, which leads to the prominence of red UCL emission. For example, Xu Changfu et al.17 reported that nearly 40% of Er3+-doped Yb3Al5O12 exhibits intense red UCL emission. Similarly, Wei Wei et al.18 reported a nearly pure red UCL emission by doping 100% Er3+ into the NaYbF4 matrix. However, extremely high concentrations of doped rare earth sensitizer ions not only result in poor crystal thermal conductivity but also high cost, which seriously hampers widespread use in practice. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we hope to find a matrix that can cause a strong CR effect even under low concentration doping conditions (<10%). The SrF2 matrix seems to have the potential to satisfy the above requirements because it has a unique property that when lanthanide ions (Ln3+) are doped then Ln3+ ions tend to form clusters even at low concentrations owing to the charge compensation effect.19,20 The formation of such clusters greatly shortens the distance between the sensitizer ions, thereby promoting the CR effect between the sensitizer ions even at low concentrations.
Among all inorganic fluorides, SrF2 is an excellent UCL material, which has attracted great interest due to its low phonon cutoff energy, good stability, electron accepting behavior and nonhygroscopicity.21–23 For example, S. Kuznetsov et al.24 reported that the UC quantum yields of SrF2:Yb3+,Er3+ samples reach nearly 2.8% at a low excitation power. M. Runowski et al.25 observed a linear relationship between the pressure and the emission lifetime of SrF2:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs, which enabled their application in high-pressure optical sensors. However, prominent red UCL emission in erbium single-doped and erbium/ytterbium co-doped SrF2 NP systems and possible mechanism studies have not been provided in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, a series of erbium single-doped and erbium/ytterbium co-doped SrF2 NPs were fabricated via a hydrothermal synthesis technique followed by high-temperature calcination. Structural, morphology, particle size, and element information of as-obtained NPs were explored by XRD, SEM and EDX. The probable mechanism of the UCL emission process in SrF2 NP systems was systematically studied by the energy gap law, R/G values and the number of photons n. A further increase in the red UCL emission intensity was achieved by co-doping the sensitizer ytterbium ions and finding the optimum doping contents. Intense red UCL emission of erbium/ytterbium co-doped SrF2 NPs is advisable for the bio-imaging and photodynamic therapy.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Erbium oxide [Er2O3, 99.99%] and ytterbium oxide [Yb2O3, 99.99%] (Aladdin (Shanghai) Reagents Co. Ltd) were dissolved separately in nitric acid [HNO3 (GR)] in order to obtain respective rare earth nitrate solutions with a concentration of 0.1 M. Ammonium fluoride [NH4F] was used as a precipitant and the source of fluoride ions. Strontium nitrate [Sr(NO3)2 (AR)] was used as received, without further purification. Deionized water was used for the synthesis.
2.2 Methods

Characterization methods. 
Powder XRD patterns were recorded with a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer using CuKα radiation in the range from 10° to 80° angles with a scanning rate of 4° min−1 and the operation conditioned at 30 mA and 40 kV. The morphology of the as-obtained samples was measured by SEM measurements using a Tecnai G2 F20 SEM. The element information of the as-obtained samples was obtained by EDX analysis. The FT-IR spectrum (3500 cm−1–500 cm−1) of the as-obtained samples was recorded using a Shimadzu IRAffinity-1 infrared spectrophotometer. The Raman spectra of the as-obtained samples were recorded on an InVia reflex confocal micro Raman spectroscopy system using an Ar+ laser operating at 532 nm. The UCL emission spectra were obtained using a HITACHI F-2700 luminescence spectrometer equipped with a continuous 980 nm diode-pumped solid-state laser. The diffuse reflectance spectra in the range 400–1400 nm were obtained using a UV-3600 UV–vis spectrophotometer.


Preparation methods. 
SrF2 NPs doped with x mol% Er3+ ions (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0) and y mol% Yb3+ ions (y = 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0) co-doped SrF2:2 mol% Er3+ NPs were prepared by the hydrothermal synthesis technique followed by high-temperature calcination and the chemical equations are as follows: (1) (2)
The y mol% Yb3+ co-doped SrF2:2 mol% Er3+ NPs were prepared as follows: first, (98% − y%) × 2 mmol of Sr(NO3)2 was added to a single-necked flask with 30 mL of deionized water with vigorous agitation for 15 min at 40 °C. Then 0.4 mL Er(NO3)3 (0.1 M) and 0.2y mL Yb(NO3)3 (0.1 M) were dissolved in deionized water, and next they were added into the solution and stirred until completely mixed. The above mixture solution was formed in Sr:Er:Yb = (98 − y):2:y molar ratios. Subsequently, a volume of 4.0 mL of NH4F (1 M) solution was added to precipitate cations. The obtained reaction solution was heated in a 100 mL hydro-thermal autoclave at 180 °C for 12 h. After the completion of the reaction and natural cooling of the autoclave, the synthesized white particles, which were collected by centrifugation, were washed several times with absolute ethanol and deionized water, subsequently. The white particles were dried by keeping in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h. Eventually, the white precursor was fired at 800 °C for 2 h and then the objective NPs were synthesized. The desired product SrF2:x mol% Er3+ was also synthesized similarly.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Crystal structure and morphologies
Structural information and phase purity of the as-prepared SrF2:2 mol% Er3+,y mol% Yb3+ NPs were measured by XRD analysis and the results are presented in Fig. 1, respectively. The standard data for SrF2 (JCPD No. 06-0262) are mentioned as a reference for the original structural model. All diffraction peaks of NPs are well indexed to the SrF2 phase with the cubic space group of Fm3m and no palpable other impurity phase is observed, demonstrating that the SrF2 NPs are single-phase and the introduction of dopant ions (Er3+,Yb3+) does not cause any phase change. Interestingly, we can see from the right inset of Fig. 1 that the diffraction peak of the (111) lattice plane move towards a larger angle when the Yb3+ ion concentration increases from 0 to 5 mol%. Based on the Bragg formula:26 (3)

As the interplanar spacing (d) decreases, the diffraction peak angle (θ) becomes larger. Since the ionic radius of Sr2+ (1.26 Å) is larger than Er3+ (1.004 Å) and Yb3+ (0.985 Å),27 Yb3+ ions enter the crystal lattice by substituting Sr2+, resulting in a decrease in interplanar spacing (d). It is easy to understand why the diffraction peak of the (111) lattice plane gradually shifts towards a larger angle, and the phenomenon of peak shifting indicates that rare earth ions (Er3+,Yb3+) can be successfully incorporated into the SrF2 matrix by substituting strontium ions or occupying the interstitial sites in the lattice.
Based on the maximum half-width of the (111) crystal plane, the crystallite size of SrF2:2 mol% Er3+ and 5 mol% Yb3+ co-doped SrF2:2 mol% Er3+ samples were obtained by Scherrer's equation28 and the results are shown in Table 1. The crystallite size is about 60 nm.

It was discovered directly from the SEM picture in the inset of Fig. 2 that the as-obtained crystalline particles presented a sphere-like morphology, unfortunately, a certain degree of agglomeration of the nanospheres was observed, which is caused by high temperature calcination at 800 °C. The average size is about 80 nm, basically consistent with the results calculated by Scherrer's formula. The elemental compositions of the SrF2:2 mol% Er3+,5 mol% Yb3+ NPs were demonstrated by EDX mapping. The EDX information (Fig. 2) illustrated the presence of strontium (Sr), fluorine (F), ytterbium (Yb), and erbium (Er), which confirmed that the samples are SrF2:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs.

3.2 Raman spectroscopy analysis of SrF2:Er3+
It is well known that the smaller the phonon cutoff energy of the matrix, the weaker the multi-phonon relaxation (MR) processes of the metastable energy manifold, thereby leading to an improvement of the UCL efficiency.29 Therefore, it is very necessary to perform a Raman spectroscopy test to understand the phonon cutoff energy of SrF2 NPs. As shown in Fig. 3, the Raman spectra of the SrF2 NPs exhibit only a band centered at 309.1 cm−1, which is consistent with previous literature reports.30 So far, the phonon cutoff energy of NaYF4, which is considered to be the most ideal up-conversion material, is 400 cm−1.31 Therefore, SrF2 NPs have the potential to become an ideal UC material. On the other hand, if organic groups such as OH−, CO, etc. are attached to the surface of the SrF2 NPs, the MR process can also be promoted.32,33 However, the synthesized SrF2 NPs were calcined at 800 °C, and even when organic groups were present on the surface of the NPs, they were calcined. Therefore, as expected, tensile vibrations caused by OH− and CO in the FT-IR spectrum (inset of Fig. 3) were not detected.

3.3 Upconversion spectroscopy analysis of SrF2:Er3+

Fig. 4(a) shows the UCL spectrum of x mol% erbium ions (x = 0.5–6) single-doped SrF2 NPs at an operating voltage of 700 V and the emission slit is 2.5 nm. The UC emission spectra are made up of a prominent red emission peak and two relatively weak green emissions peaks under NIR laser excitation. The intense red emission is composed of a broad peak from 620 nm to 700 nm with the maximum emission intensity of 670 nm, which corresponds to the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition of erbium. Furthermore, two relatively weak peaks centered at 525 nm and 548 nm assigned to the 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of erbium, respectively, are observed.34,35
 Fig. 4  (a) The UCL spectra of SrF2: x mol% Er3+(x = 0.5–6) NPs under 500 mW 980 nm laser excitation, (b) presents the red and green UCL intensity as well as the R/G values vs. Er3+concentration (x). 

Fig. 4(b) shows, as expected the integrated UCL emission intensity increased significantly with increasing erbium ion content in the low concentration range, and there is no concentration quenching effect. The R/G value could be obtained in the following manner:36 (4)wherein IR and IG are the maximum UCL emission intensities in the range of 620 nm to 700 nm and 500 nm to 575 nm, respectively. The R/G values of the SrF2:x mol% Er3+ samples (x = 0.5–6.0) are tabulated in Table 2. Interestingly, as the doping amount of erbium ions increases from 1–4 mol%, the R/G values increase rapidly, when the dopant content of erbium ions exceeds 4 mol%, the R/G value begins to decrease slowly. The maximum R/G value is 13.74 when the erbium ions concentration is 4 mol%, indicating that the non-radiative processes such as CR and MR have a large contribution during the UCL process in the SrF2 system.37–39

In the classical UC mechanism of single-doped erbium, electrons of the ground state erbium ions would be excited to the 4I11/2 manifold by absorbed 980 nm photons (ground-state absorption (GSA) processes). Concurrently, some electrons at the excited 4I11/2 manifold are further transferred to the highest 4F7/2 manifold by reabsorbing the same energy of 980 nm photons (excited state absorption (ESA) processes). Subsequently, these excited electrons at the 4F7/2 manifold are non-radiatively relaxed by the MR process to the lower 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 manifold and are further relaxed to the 4F9/2 manifold. Consequently, the characteristic red and green luminescence emission of erbium are obtained by 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 and 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 radiative transitions, respectively. According to this classical mechanism, the way to populate the red and green emission manifold is the same, and the energy of the 980 nm photons absorbed by the matrix increases as the concentration of activator ions (erbium) increases, so the increase of red and green UC emission intensity should be much the same, in other words, R/G does not show a distinct change with the concentration of erbium ions. However, the experimental results show that the R/G value depends on the concentration of erbium ions in the SrF2 host, indicating that the populating process of the red emission 4F9/2 manifold differs from that of the green emission 2H11/2/4S3/2 manifold.
3.4 Multi-phonon relaxation analysis of SrF2:Er3+
The MR process plays a crucial role in the optical properties of UCL materials. The efficiency of the UC process is primarily affected by MR process, which further affects the R/G value. So, it is very necessary to conduct detailed research of the MR process to understand the UC mechanism in the SrF2 matrix. The MR rate (P) could be obtained from eqn (5):40 (5)where the numerator is the energy gap of two manifolds and the denominator is the maximum phonon cutoff energy of the SrF2 host. According to the Raman spectrum, the phonon energy of the synthesized SrF2 samples is 309.1 cm−1, and the results calculated according to the above formula are presented in Fig. 5. According to the energy gap law, the MR process cannot occur when the p value is greater than 5.41–43 Therefore, the populating processes of the 2H11/2/4S3/2 manifold can be achieved by the MR process of 4F7/2 → 2H11/2 and 2H11/2 → 2S3/2, their P values are 4.28 and 2.55, respectively. This is why there are two UC green emission bands in the erbium single-doped SrF2 nanoparticle's UC spectrum.
 Fig. 5  The P values of the obtained SrF2:Yb3+,Er3+ nanoparticles are calculated. 
As we all know, the red emission 4F9/2 manifold could be populated by two possible MR processes. The first way, as described in the classical mechanism, is the MR process of 4S3/2 → 4F9/2; another method is the transition from the 4I13/2 to 4F9/2 manifold by the ESA process, the 4I13/2 manifold is populated by the MR process of 4I11/2 → 4I13/2. Unfortunately, the P values of these two MR processes are 9.97 and 11.70, respectively. Hence, none of them can occur because their P values are greater than 5. Moreover, we can derive from the FT-IR spectrum that the surface of the synthesized NPs does not have any organic groups with high vibration frequency, and these organic groups are considered to play a role in bridging the two large energy levels. Therefore, the CR effect is considered to be the key to strong red UCL emissions of erbium single-doped SrF2 NPs.
For the red UCL emission mechanism, there are three possible CR processes: the CR1 process [4F7/2 → 4F9/2 (5311 cm−1): 4I11/2 → 4F9/2 (5059 cm−1)], the CR2 process [4S3/2 → 4I9/2 (5953 cm−1): 4I15/2 → 4I13/2 (6463 cm−1)] and the CR3 process [2H11/2 → 4F9/2 (3828 cm−1): 4I13/2 → 4I11/2 (3638 cm−1)].44,45 These three CR processes can be implemented quickly and easily because their mismatched energy differences are very small, 252cm−1, 530 cm−1 and 190 cm−1, respectively, and they can all be compensated by one or two photons. The extent to which the CR effect affects UCL emission depends primarily on the amount of photo-activator ions. When the doping content of erbium ions is low, it is sparsely distributed in the SrF2 host, and the distance between two adjacent erbium ions is long, resulting in a small contribution of the CR effect, so the red emission intensity is weak and the R/G value is relatively small. As the erbium ion content increases, the distance between erbium ions becomes smaller, resulting in a large contribution of the CR effect, so the red luminescence intensity and the R/G value increase as the erbium ions content increases. However, when the doping content of erbium ions is high enough, the distance between erbium ions is shortened, which inevitably leads to energy migration to other luminescence centers or defects, and the concentration quenching effect is more significant, and the CR effect is weakened, thus R/G decreases.
3.5 Pumping power analysis of SrF2:Er3+
In order to obtain a deeper understanding of the detailed UC mechanisms in the SrF2 host, the pump power (P) dependence of red (∼670 nm) and green (∼548 nm) UCL intensity is explored and presented in Fig. 6. The number of photons (n) to be absorbed during the populating process of the 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 manifold, could be found by using the formula:46–48 (6)
 Fig. 6  Pump-power dependence on UCL intensity of SrF2:Er3+ NPs. 
According to the formula, by drawing a plot of log(I) vs. log(P), and then fitting to get the slope gives the n of the UC process. In the classical case, the n values of the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transitions are very close to 2.49 However, we can see from Fig. 6 that the slopes of the red and green emission are 1.10 and 1.26, respectively, and they all deviate significantly from the expected value of 2. According to Liu et al.50 and R. Pazik et al.,39 the lower n value close to 1 may indicate that the non-radiative process has a strong contribution to UCL properties. It is noteworthy that by studying the behavior of R/G and n, it is found that they all reflect the strong CR process that exists during the UC of SrF2 NPs. Therefore, we can almost certainly conclude that the reason for why the red luminescence intensity is stronger than the green luminescence intensity is that there are some effective CR processes during the UC process.
3.6 Upconversion spectroscopy analysis of SrF2:Er3+,Yb3+
As we all know, erbium is the most common UCL emission activator, but its UCL emission intensity is limited due to its small absorption cross-sectional area (1.7 × 10−21 cm2) of 976 nm. In order to further increase the UCL emission intensity of erbium, we need to co-dope the sensitizer ytterbium ions because they has the following two advantages: (i) the absorption cross-sectional area (11.7 × 10−21 cm2) of 980 nm is almost 7 times larger than that of erbium, so its energy efficiency for absorption is higher than erbium.15 (ii) The ΔE between 2F5/2 and 2F7/2 of ytterbium ions (10113 cm−1) is almost the same as the ΔE between 4I11/2 and 4I15/2 of (10124 cm−1) erbium ions, thus ytterbium can transfer energy efficiently to erbium through the energy transfer up-conversion process (ETUC1: [2F5/2 → 4F7/2 (Yb3+): 4I11/2 → 4F7/2(Er3+)]).16
In order to visually show that ytterbium can increase the UCL intensity of erbium, The UCL spectrum of 2 mol% Er3+ doped and 2 mol% Er3+,1 mol% Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 samples are obtained under the same conditions (operating voltage of 700 V and emission slit of 5.0 nm) and are shown in Fig. 7. We can see that the red UCL emission intensity is increased by about 10 times due to the doping of 1 mol% ytterbium. And we further investigate the effect of ytterbium on the intensity of UCL by fixing the erbium content and changing the ytterbium concentration.
 Fig. 7  The UCL emission spectrum of SrF2:2 mol% Er3+ and SrF2:2 mol% Er3+,1 mol% Yb3+ samples under 500 mW 980 nm laser excitation. 

Fig. 8(a) shows the UCL intensity of SrF2:2 mol% Er3+,y mol% Yb3+ under an excitation of 980 nm and operating voltage of 400 V and the slit of 2.5 nm, as a function of ytterbium ion contents. As the content of ytterbium ions increases, the integrated UCL emission intensity continues to increase and both red and green emission intensity reaches the maximum intensity at 5 mol% and 6 mol%, respectively. When the content of ytterbium is increased to 5 mol%, the red luminescence intensity is increased by more than 20 times. Therefore, comparing the 2 mol% Er3+single-doped with the 2 mol% Er3+,5 mol% Yb3+co-doped sample it was found that the red UCL emission intensity is increased by about 200 times in the 2 mol% Er3+,5 mol% Yb3+co-doped sample, which proves that ytterbium is an effective sensitizer and can efficiently transfer energy to erbium.
 Fig. 8  (a) The UCL emission spectra of SrF2:2 mol% Er3+,y mol% Yb3+(y = 1.0–7.0) NPs under 500 mW 980 nm laser excitation, and (b) the green and red UCL intensity and the R/G values vs. Yb3+concentrations (y). 
Moreover, we can see from Fig. 9 that the UCL intensity can be remarkably improved by co-doping Yb3+ ions, and the enhancement of the luminescence intensity can be observed with the naked eye. The distance between ytterbium and erbium becomes shorter as the content of ytterbium increases, which is beneficial for the transfer of energy from ytterbium to erbium, so the integrated UCL emission intensity continues to increase. Unfortunately, the distance between the ytterbium and ytterbium ions is also shortened, which inevitably leads to energy migration to other luminescent centers or defects. Therefore, upon a further increase in the ytterbium ion content above the threshold, the effect of the concentration quenching effect becomes ever more significant, resulting in a decrease in the integrated UCL intensity. Significantly, the optimum doping contents of red and green emission are different, because populating processes of the red emission 4F9/2 manifold is different from that of the green emission 2H11/2/4S3/2 manifold.

We can see from Fig. 8(b) that the R/G values of SrF2:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs decrease as the ytterbium content increases, nonetheless, it is still very high indicating that the CR effect is still the main contributor to the UCL intensity in the co-doped system of ytterbium and erbium. Ytterbium ions can effectively transfer the absorbed energy to the erbium ions through the ETUC process, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of electrons of the 4I11/2 and 4F7/2 manifolds of the erbium ions. Subsequently, most of these excited states return to the ground state through three CR processes. Ytterbium ions increase the number of electrons involved in these CR processes to a great extent, so the red UCL emission intensity is further increased. It can be observed from the power and intensity relationship of SrF2:Yb3+,Er3+ NPs (Fig. 10) that the slopes of red and green emission are 1.06 and 1.33, respectively, again indicating that the contribution of the CR effect to UCL intensity is prominent.

3.7 Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy analysis of SrF2:Er3+,Yb3+
The diffuse reflectance spectra of SrF2:2 mol% Er3+,y mol% Yb3+(y = 0, 1, 3 and 5) in the 200–1400 nm spectral range are presented in Fig. 11. For the 2 mol% Er3+ singly doped SrF2 sample, the diffuse reflectance spectrum consists of absorption peaks originating from the 4I15/2 manifold to 5G11/2, 4F7/2, 2H11/2, 4F9/2 and 4I11/2 manifold transitions of erbium, at 380 nm, 490 nm, 522 nm, 658 nm and 976 nm, respectively. For Yb3+,Er3+co-doped SrF2 samples, it can be seen that the doping of ytterbium has an inconspicuous influence on the erbium absorption peak's position and the integrated absorption intensity does not exhibit a significant change except for the absorption peaks at 976 nm. However, the absorption peak intensity of erbium at 976 nm is very weak, indicating that the energy absorbed by erbium by the GSA process is very limited, so the UCL intensity of single-doped Er3+ samples is weak. Conversely, the large absorption peak of ytterbium in the range of 830–1060 nm indicates that it can efficiently absorb the photon energy in the range of this band. The broad absorption peak is caused by the complete overlap of 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 transitions of ytterbium with the narrower 2I15/2 → 2I11/2 transitions of the erbium band at 976 nm, which can demonstrate that erbium and ytterbium can be excited simultaneously at 980 nm excitation. Moreover, the absorption peak intensity of ytterbium increases with its content, indicating that the energy absorbed by Yb3+ increases. Synchronously, ytterbium effectively transfers the absorbed 980 nm photon energy to erbium through the ETUC process, acting as a 'bridge'. It is easy to understand why ytterbium ions increase the red UCL emission intensity by a factor of 200.

3.8 Energy transfer mechanism of SrF2:Er3+,Yb3+
The schematic energy level drawing of erbium and ytterbium as well as the proposed red and green UC emission mechanisms route to Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 nanoparticles is compendiously presented in Fig. 12. In only erbium ion doped samples, the electrons of erbium in the ground state 4I15/2 manifold are excited to the 4I11/2 manifold by their own GSA process, and then the electrons at the 4I11/2 manifold are transferred to the 4F7/2 manifold by the ESA processes. According to the diffuse reflectance spectrum, the efficiency of transferring energy to erbium through the ETUC process of ytterbium is significantly stronger than the efficiency of energy absorbed by erbium's own GSA and ESA processes. Therefore, in the case of erbium and ytterbium ion co-doping, the electrons at the 4I11/2 manifold are mainly populated by the ETUC1 process and these electrons are further excited to the 4F7/2 manifold by the ETUC2 process [2F5/2 → 4F7/2(Yb3+): 4I11/2 → 4F7/2(Er3+)]. Irrespective of whether the samples are single-doped or co-doped, the process of electron relaxation from the metastable energy manifold to the ground-state energy manifold is almost the same. For green UCL emission, the 4F7/2 manifold transition to the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 manifold is performed by the MR process, and then the green characteristic emission at 525 nm and 548 nm is emitted by the radiation transition to the stable ground state 4I15/2 manifold, respectively.
 Fig. 12  Schematic drawing of erbium and ytterbium energy levels and the proposed UCL mechanism under 980 nm excitation. 
The 4F9/2 manifold responsible for red emission is mainly populated by three CR processes. First, the electrons at the 4F7/2 manifold and the electrons at the 4I11/2 manifold are transferred to the 4F9/2 manifold by the CR1 process, so that the electrons are enriched at the 4F9/2 manifold and red UCL emission is promoted. Then, the electrons in the 4S3/2 manifold are transferred to the 4I9/2 manifold through the CR2 process, while the electrons in the ground state 4I15/2 manifold are transferred to the 4I13/2 manifold, and then the electrons in the 4I13/2 manifold are shifted to the 4F9/2 manifold by the ETUC3 process [2F5/2 → 4F7/2(Yb3+):4I13/2 → 4F9/2(Er3+)]. The CR2 process relaxes most of the electrons at the 4S3/2 manifold to the 4F9/2 manifold, thereby suppressing the emission at 548 nm and promoting the emission at 670 nm. Finally, the electrons of the 4H11/2 manifold for green emission are directly transferred to the 4F9/2 manifold of the red emission by the CR3 process, so that green is restrained and red is promoted. It can be seen from the above three CR processes that red luminescence is promoted at the expense of green luminescence quenching. This may be the reason why the red emission in the SrF2 UCL spectrum is significantly stronger than the green emission.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, using the hydrothermal synthesis technique followed by high-temperature calcination, a series of erbium mono-doped and erbium/ytterbium co-doped SrF2 NPs were synthesized. XRD analysis showed that the synthesized sample is a pure cubic phase, which was confirmed by EDX analysis to contain Sr, F, Yb and Er elements, so the desired cubic phase erbium/ytterbium co-doped SrF2 NPs was successfully synthesized. The emission spectrum of erbium mono-doped SrF2 NPs excited by a 980 nm laser is composed of a prominent red emission peak centered at ∼670 nm as well as two oppositely faint green emissions peaks centered at ∼525 nm and ∼548 nm. According to the energy gap law, we have proved that the strong red emission is neither attributed to the MR process from the 4S3/2 manifold relaxation to the 4F9/2 manifold, nor to the MR process from the 4I11/2 manifold relaxation to the 4I13/2 manifold but to the ESA process to the 4F9/2 manifold. From the phenomenon of a high R/G value and slope n close to 1, we can deduce that prominent UC red emission arises from the highly efficient CR effect between adjacent Er3+ during the UC process. Thereby, we clarify in detail that phonon energy can be used to adjust the optical properties of lanthanides by affecting non-radiative relaxation processes such as multiphoton relaxation and cross-relaxation. About 200-fold enhancement in the red UCL emission intensity is observed for 2 mol% Er3+,5 mol% Yb3+ co-doped SrF2 sample compared to the 2 mol% Er3+ mono-doped SrF2 sample. This increase is ascribed to the existence of effective ETUC from ytterbium to erbium and ytterbium's ability to absorb 980 nm photon energy is significantly stronger than erbium which was confirmed by the diffuse reflectance spectrum.
