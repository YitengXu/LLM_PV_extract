    , Accepted 13th December 2021First published on 13th December 2021AbstractIn this research, we realized the conversion of visible light to electrical energy and C–H activation by the synergistic catalytic effect of visible-light and photoelectric current. An atom-economical and environment-friendly self-biasing interfacial photo-electrocatalytic method for cascade C–H activation/cyclization is provided to construct N-containing fused ring compounds using an m-BiVO4 film as a photoanode. There are obvious advantages of this transformation due to no external bias and a small overpotential, saving electrical energy and avoiding excessive oxidation of malononitrile to achieve better chemical reactivity and selectivity. Meanwhile, the recovered photoanode could be used more than ten times.
Introduction
Over the past years, interfacial photoelectrochemistry (iPEC) has received considerable attention as an efficient and green tool for water splitting,1 conversion of carbon dioxide2 and pollutant degradation due to its safe, cost-effective and sustainable nature.3 Expanding its application to the field of organic synthesis is still in its infancy.4 Up to now, only a few oxidation reactions of simple substrates, such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural,5 benzylic alcohols,6 furan,7 tetralin,6a cycloolefins8 and cyclohexane,9 have been tested with the oxidizing power of photoanodes. More recently, Fe2O3 and BiVO4 as photoanode materials have been successfully used to realize C–H functionalization and cross-dehydrogenative-coupling (CDC) reaction to construct C–N10 and C–P11 bonds in PEC cells (Fig. 1). The applied external bias was typically required to achieve the above reactions, and is applied to improve charge separation or to drive the reaction at the metal counter electrode.10 Although electricity is saved with the help of light-harvesting,10,11 PEC synthesis is not only still driven by the energy of light and electricity, but also leads to low selectivity and uncontrollability of the organic conversions.

In order to prevent the above shortcomings, the self-biasing interfacial photoelectrochemical cell12 could be a better option for organic transformations due to its rather small overpotential, which may avoid excessive oxidation to reduce unnecessary conversion (side reactions) and achieve better chemical reactivity and selectivity. It allows us to realize paired electrolysis in which two desirable half-reactions are performed simultaneously. The power consumption for oxidizing/reducing sacrificial substances is avoided, but the energy utilization efficiency is maximized.13 Meanwhile, the corrosion of the photoelectrode could also be suppressed. In addition, the photoelectrode is easier to separate, reuse and recycle than homogeneous photoelectrocatalysts, with features of being cheap and nontoxic and showing long-term chemical stability. Although a high reducing or oxidizing power could be generated in the self-biasing PEC cells only under light irradiation, they have not been applied in organic synthesis.
The direct C–H bond functionalization is recognized as one of the reliable methods for constructing complex molecules, which has the advantages of atomic economy and easy access to starting materials. According to the C–H activation mechanism, it is found that the single electron transfer (SET) process is usually the main pathway in transition metal catalysis. It means that the direct C–H bond functionalization is realized via the radical pathway. When the reaction system has a higher secondary oxidizing ability, the free radicals could be oxidized again to form a cation by losing another electron. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a more suitable and milder method to control the reactivity and chemical selectivity. Recently, we demonstrated that a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) photoanode could be successfully used as an interface photocatalyst to enable an α-oxyamination of 1,3-dicarbonyls with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinooxy (TEMPO) under visible-light irradiation.14 Surprisingly, there was an obvious improvement in reaction yield in the case of a shortened reaction time and reducing the amount of photocatalyst using DSSC equipped with N719-sensitized TiO2 or TiO2 as a photoanode and Pt as a counter electrode. We supposed that the self-biasing PEC process might increase the reaction rate. Based on the literature reports, malononitrile as a “CN” agent reacts with tetrahydroisoquinolines to construct the corresponding α-aminonitriles with lower atomic economy and strong oxidation ability.15 Herein, we report the atom-economical and environment-friendly photoelectrocatalytic cascade C–H activation/cyclization to construct N-containing fused ring compounds using tetrahydroisoquinolines as a starting material and an m-BiVO4 film as a photoanode in PEC cells without an external electrical bias.
Results and discussion
Inspired and encouraged by our previous works, the photoelectrocatalytic transformation of 2-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1a) and malononitrile (2a) was employed as a model reaction (Table 1). Since BiVO4 has been extensively studied for photo-assisted water-splitting reactions owing to its long-term stability and a suitable bandgap of 2.4 eV for strong visible light absorption, the BiVO4 electrode was chosen as the photoanode in this study.11,16 The reaction could be performed with a constant potential at 0.4 V versus Ag/AgCl under blue LED (3 W) irradiation in an undivided cell to afford 2-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-1-carbonitrile (3a) and 5,12a-dihydroindolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline-12,12(6H)-dicarbonitrile (4a) (entry 1) in 42% and 54% yield, respectively. The product yield could not be improved with the changes of the applied bias voltage (entries 2 and 3). On replacing the electrolyte with ammonium chloride, a higher yield (71%) and selectivity (4:1) of 4a were obtained (entries 4–7). The optimized solvent for this photoelectrocatalytic process was EtOH (entries 8–11). The lower loading of reagent 2a or the faster reaction time led to a decreasing yield of the cyclized product 4a (entries 12–15). Surprisingly, the compound 4a was produced in 72% yield without using the bias (entry 16). The reaction was unsuccessful in the absence of the photoanode and in the case of dark conditions (entries 17 and 18); this showed that the photocurrent is essential to perform this reaction. The conversion of 1a dropped sharply under an argon atmosphere (entry 19). Compound 3a could be afforded as a major product with 61% yield under an O2 atmosphere (entry 20). This unexpected result is probably due to the oxidative degradation of malononitrile to cleave the C–CN bond by O2.15b,c To gain insight into the reusability of the BiVO4 photoanode, it was recycled for the cascade C–H activation/cyclization upon cleaning with CH2Cl2. More than ten times recycling still gives a similar catalytic activity of the photoanode to a freshly made photoanode (see details in the ESI, Fig. S1†).

With the optimized conditions in hand, a large number of the substrates were subsequently explored for C–H activation/cyclization (Fig. 2). In general, para-substituted N-aryltetrahydroisoquinolines bearing both electron-donating and weak inductively electron-withdrawing groups gave the desired products 4a–4g in good yields. Small amounts of by-products 3a–3g were isolated in 12–24% yields. When a stronger electron-withdrawing group (such as –CN or –CF3) is linked to N-aryltetrahydroisoquinolines, not only the reaction selectivity is reversed (3h–3i and 4h–4i), but also the conversion efficiency of N-aryltetrahydroisoquinolines (for 1h–1i) is low. To explain the phenomenon, the ADCH (atomic dipole moment corrected Hirshfeld) charges for the intermediates A3, I, II, B3 and B5 were calculated (Fig. 2b).17 It indicates that the substance with more positive ADCH charges (II) is more likely to be attacked by substances with more negative charges (CN−). Similar results were found in the case of meta-substituted N-aryltetrahydroisoquinolines (1j–1l). Due to strong steric hindrance, the desired product 4m could not be detected even under the optimized conditions, and only the nitrile product 3m was obtained in 53% yield. In addition, the optimal conditions could be also applied to the N-aryltetrahydroisoquinolines with 7-substituted or 6,7-disubstituted derivatives. We then found that the activity of N-aryltetrahydroisoquinolines with weak electron-withdrawing groups was higher than that with electron-donating groups (1n–1r).

Isolated yield. b12 h. c8 h. d24 h. e4 h. 
The activity of malononitrile derivatives as nucleophiles was also studied using the optimized conditions (Fig. 2c). Through all investigations, the N-containing fused rings (4s–4w) were selectively afforded in moderate to good yields, accompanied by the by-products (3a and 3p) in 2–16% yields due to the oxidation of malononitriles. It was worth mentioning that the isolated products 4s–4w are chiral compounds with a diastereomeric ratio of 4:1–3:1. The single-crystal structures of products 4a, 4j1 and 4s were confirmed by X-ray analysis (ESI, Tables S1–S3†).
To probe the properties and role of BiVO4 in photoelectrocatalysis, some (photo)electrochemical measurements were performed using the BiVO4 photoanode. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, we found that BiVO4 is in a monoclinic phase (Fig. 3A), showing a well-visible light response and good photocatalytic activity.18 The BiVO4 thin film exhibited a strong absorption intensity in the visible-light region at about 450 nm (Fig. 3B) with a band gap of 2.40 eV. The results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the diameter of the semicircle in Nyquist diagrams is associated with the charge resistance of the layers (BiVO4) for redox processes, and the BiVO4 photoanode can decrease the charge transfer resistance and improve electron–hole separation under blue LED irradiation (Fig. 3C).16,19 The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the BiVO4 photoanode revealed the following: (1) the oxidation process was observed only at potentials higher than 0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl in the darkness, and had already started at E = 0 V under the blue LED (3 W) irradiation; (2) the photovoltage supplied by BiVO4 for this reaction was about 0.8 V, and produced a 0.5 mA photocurrent; (3) the maximum theoretical photocurrent might be 0.12 mA from the intersection point of the two LSV curves of BiVO4/FTO and Pt (Fig. 3D).20 Judging from the LSV curve of BiVO4 in the presence of EtOH, some of the photogenerated holes from BiVO4 were used to oxidize EtOH. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes might be applied to oxidize N-aryltetrahydroisoquinoline (1a) but not malononitrile (2a) (Fig. S3†). In the absence of an external bias, the photocurrent density was about 23 μA cm−2 under visible light irradiation as determined by transient photocurrent response analysis of PEC organic synthesis (Fig. 3E), and the faradaic efficiency was 76%.20 From the Mott–Schottky curve10,21 (Fig. 3F) and LSV of the BiVO4 photoanode (Fig. 3D), the flat-band potential was calculated to be Efb = −0.39 V versus Ag/AgCl and Eonset = −0.35 V versus Ag/AgCl, respectively. The small overpotential of the oxidation might be the difference between the Eonset and Efb (Eonset − Efb = 0.04 V).10

Subsequently, several control experiments were performed to explain the detailed mechanism of the photoelectrocatalytic cascade C–H activation/cyclization (Fig. 4). According to the above results of (photo)electrochemical measurements (Fig. 3D), the BiVO4 photoanode could serve as a dark electrode under a higher applied potential. For the cascade C–H activation/cyclization in the dark, the bias was a pre-requisite to shift from 0 to 0.8 V to produce a 0.5 mA current. The product 4a was formed in 34% yield with 0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl (exp. 1). We also tried this reaction at 0.5 mA in a C|Pt undivided cell, but the yield was lowered to 14% (exp. 2). Moreover, the divided cell gave only a 12% yield of product 4a (exp. 3), which indicates that some reduction reactions on the Pt cathode might be a necessary step to realize this transformation. The product 4a could be slightly decomposed under the optimized reaction conditions (exp 4–6), due to the similar oxidation peak between product 4a (Eox = 0.93 V versus Ag/AgCl) and 2-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1a, Eox = 0.89 V versus Ag/AgCl) (Fig. 5G). Furthermore, the desired product 4a was also isolated in 64% yield from 2-(2-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)malononitrile (C) which might be a main intermediate for the photoelectrocatalytic transformation (Fig. 4C). Compared with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxide (TEMPO) is a better radical scavenger for the photoelectrocatalytic cascade C–H activation/cyclization (exp. 8–9). Meanwhile, four strong molecular ion peaks were detected by ESI-MS, attributable to A3 (exact mass: 208.1121), G (exact mass: 272.1182), [III + H]+ (exact mass: 428.2948) and [IV + H]+ (exact mass: 285.1961) (see ESI Fig. S18–S28†), implying that the radical might be involved in this transformation. According to the detection of reactive oxygen species,22 the reaction proceeded unaffectedly in the presence of the hydroxyl radical (HO˙) quenching agent TBA or singlet oxygen quenching (1O2) agent DBACO, which indicated that HO˙ and 1O2 were not the reactive oxygen species in this system. In contrast, a p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) control experiment demonstrated that O2˙− plays a major role in defining the outcome (Fig. 4E and Fig. S29†). In addition, with the increase in the scan rate (Fig. 5A and D), the oxidation peak currents for both reagents 1a and 2a were increased linearly (Fig. 5B and E); therefore the oxidation of 1a and 2a was an absorption-controlled process. The oxidation step involves a two-electron process for 1a and a one-electron process for 2a based on calculations by the Laviron method (Fig. 5C and F).

All reaction components were not excited by blue LED irradiation in a lower concentration solution except the BiVO4 photoanode. However, a weak absorption of malononitrile (2a) was detected in a higher concentration solution ([2a] = 6 × 10−2 M) (Fig. 5H). The conduction-band and flat-band potentials of BiVO4 (−0.19 eV versus NHE) from the Mott–Schottky curve exhibit a more negative potential than the standard redox potential of O2/O2˙− (−0.046 eV versus NHE),23 but a more positive potential than that of H+/H2 (−0.41 eV versus NHE).24 Therefore, the photogenerated electrons transformed into a cathode, and then O2 was in turn reduced to O2˙− and hydrogen. The redox couple (O2/O2˙−) at the counter electrode well matches the flat-band potential of the photoanode. This might be the reason why the photoelectrocatalytic cascade C–H activation/cyclization does not require any external bias.10 Owing to the lower valence band potential (EVB) than the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) of all reagents and intermediate C (Fig. 5I and Fig. S16†), they are oxidized by photogenerated holes at the valence band. In addition, it was not difficult to find that the excited 2a could also accept photogenerated electrons from the conduction-band or flat-band potential of BiVO4 to afford the radical anion [2a]˙− (Fig. 5I).
Density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations were applied to explain the proposed mechanism (Fig. 6). The calculation results confirmed that the band gap energy of BiVO4 is 2.47 eV, being in good agreement with the UV-Vis absorption spectral results (Fig. 3B). Oxygen is easily reduced to a superoxide anion (26.8 kcal mol−1) at the cathode, and the matching of the redox couple (O2/O2˙−) at the counter electrode and the flat-band potential of the BiVO4 might be the reason for this smooth photoelectrocatalysis without the bias.10 Although there is no detailed applicable procedure for releasing the cyanide from the malononitrile in the literature, we suggest the following possible pathways to form a key intermediate of the malononitrile anion (B3): (1) the small pKa of malononitrile (2a, pKa = 11.89) leads to the formation of anion B3 (ΔG = −24.5 kcal mol−1) in the presence of a base; (2) malononitrile (2a) is easily reduced on the cathode to provide a radical anion B2 (ΔG = −43.3 kcal mol−1) which immediately loses one hydrogen radical with the aid of the hydroperoxide radical (HOO˙) to give the malononitrile anion B3 (ΔG = −65.1 kcal mol−1). Due to the higher energy formation of the cation radical B1 (ΔG = 60.9 kcal mol−1), malononitrile (2a) could not be oxidized on the photoanode. The calculated result is consistent with the experimental outcome of the LSV curves toward PEC oxidation. Subsequently, the malononitrile radical (B4) is produced via oxidation of anion B3 on the anode (ΔG = −52.5 kcal mol−1). Meanwhile, over-oxidation of malononitrile (2a) or the malononitrile radical (B4) leads to the formation of cyanide B5 as follows: (1) malononitrile reacts with the superoxide anion (ΔG = 15.2 kcal mol−1); (2) the radical addition between the malononitrile radical (B4) and hydroperoxide radical (HOO˙) gives compound H (ΔG = −27.8 kcal mol−1). After the dehydration (ΔG = −61.5 kcal mol−1) and nucleophilic addition (ΔG = −20.8 kcal mol−1) processes, 2-hydroperoxymalononitrile (H) releases HCN. With a loss of a proton, cyanide B5 is subsequently afforded (ΔG = −24.3 kcal mol−1). On the other hand, substrate 1a is oxidized on the photoanode to give the radical cation A1 (ΔG = −42.9 kcal mol−1). The radical A2 is generated spontaneously (ΔG = −48.1 kcal mol−1) due to the small pKa of intermediate A1 (pKa = −5.40). The iminium cation A3 is generated via the oxidation of radical A2 by the photogenerated holes (ΔG = −76.5 kcal mol−1) or the superoxide anion from the radical cation A1 (ΔG = −25.2 kcal mol−1). The intermediate C is produced via the radical addition of radical A2 to radical B4 (ΔG = −31.5 kcal mol−1) or via the ion process between the iminium cation A3 and anion B3 (ΔG = −7.5 kcal mol−1). At the same time, the electrophilic addition of the iminium cation A3 to anion B5 (ΔG = −16.4 kcal mol−1) afforded the side product 3a. Due to the high reaction energy barrier of the iminium cation A3 with radical B4 (ΔG = 57.1 kcal mol−1), the radical cation D is only formed through the oxidation process of compound C on the photoanode (ΔG = −34.1 kcal mol−1). Accompanied by the loss of a hydrogen cation by the base (ΔG = −50.0 kcal mol−1) or O2˙− (ΔG = −22.3 kcal mol−1), the radical cation D is transformed into a radical E. Moreover, the formation of radical E is also achieved through the homogeneous cleavage of the C–H bond by O2˙− (ΔG = 15.3 kcal mol−1). Although the radical cyclization from the intermediate E into F has a high energy barrier (transition state TS2, ΔG = 43.3 kcal mol−1), we conjecture that the necessary energy may be provided by the light radiation (λ = 450 nm, E = 63.53 kcal mol−1). Finally, the radical F is more easily oxidized on the photoanode (ΔG = −66.2 kcal mol−1) to give the cation G. The target product 4a is obtained with the loss of a proton from cation G by a base (ΔG = −67.9 kcal mol−1) or HOO− (ΔG = −58.8 kcal mol−1). All calculated results are well consistent with the experiments.
 Fig. 6  Density functional theory calculations were carried out at the level of the CAM-B3LYP/DEF2-TZVP(D) standard basis set.25 Spin density of transition states (TS1 and TS2) was demonstrated using Multiwfn Version 3.7(dev)26 and the VMD Version 1.9.3 program.17c 
According to the above results, we propose the following mechanism for the photoelectrocatalysis (Fig. 7). Initially, the BiVO4 photoelectrode is excited under visible light illumination to generate high energy electron–hole pairs. Then, the holes reach the surface of BiVO4 to oxidize 1a into the radical cation intermediate (1a˙+), which could be easily deprotonated by a base to provide the carbon centered neutral radical A2. The radical A2 could then be further oxidized to afford an iminium ion intermediate A3 at the photoanode. At the same time, electrons migrate from the conduction band of the BiVO4 photoanode to the counter electrode to reduce oxygen into a superoxide anion. The formation of anion B3, B5 and radical B4 is achieved through oxidation (for anion B5 and radical B4) or reduction (for anion B3). Subsequently, the main intermediate C is produced with radical coupling reaction between A2 and B4 or a nucleophilic attack of anion B3 on cation A3. Meanwhile, the by-product 3a could be also obtained via the nucleophilic attack. The oxidation of intermediate C might occur at the photoanode by the photogenerated holes to from D, which removes one proton to give the radical E. Finally, the N-containing fused ring compound 4a is afforded via addition of a benzene ring and oxidation/deprotonation processes.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a photoelectrocatalytic cascade C–H/C–C activation for construction of N-containing fused ring compounds using an m-BiVO4 film as a photoanode in the PEC cells without an external electrical bias. Various substituted N-aryltetrahydroisoquinolines are suitable for this transformation, and the corresponding products were isolated in moderate to good yields. The reaction mechanism was systematically verified by control experiments, (photo)electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations. The self-biasing interfacial photoelectrocatalytic method could successfully avoid excessive oxidation of malononitrile to selectively generate malononitrile radicals due to the small overpotential. The present work may open an avenue for the mutual conversion of light energy, electrical energy and chemical energy, and could show great potential in photoelectrochemical oxidation/reduction to convert organic chemicals into higher value products.
