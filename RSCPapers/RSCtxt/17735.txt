    , Accepted 8th March 2017First published on 9th March 2017AbstractPhoton upconversion via triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA-UC) is an intriguing strategy to potentially increase maximum solar cell efficiencies from 33% to greater than 43%. TTA-UC has been incorporated into a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) but the low solar energy conversion efficiency can be attributed, at least in part, to the relatively narrow absorption features of the sensitizer molecule. Here we incorporate multiple sensitizers into a TTA-UC DSSC using bilayer and trilayer self-assembly via metal ion linkages. The sensitizers' complementary absorption features increase broad-band light absorption and work cooperatively to achieve peak TTA-UC efficiency at sub-solar irradiance (<1 sun or <100 mW cm−2). The trilayer DSSC, with high sensitizer density and directional energy transfer cascade towards the charge seperation interface, exhibited the highest efficiency yet reported for harvesting low energy light in an integrated TTA-UC solar cell (1.2 × 10−3%).
Introduction
Photon upconversion via triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA-UC) is a strategy for combining two or more low energy photons to generate a higher energy excited state.1 This upconversion process is of interest for a number of applications including photodynamic therapy,2 bioimaging,3 oxygen sensing,4 and others.5–9 TTA-UC is particularly intriguing for applications in solar energy conversion as a means of harnessing low energy photons, and potentially increasing the maximum theoretical solar cell efficiencies from 33% (i.e. the Shockley–Queisser limit) to greater than 43%.10 Efficient photon upconversion has been demonstrated in a number of different motifs including in solutions,1 polymers,11,12 metal organic frameworks,13 neat solvent,14 doped matrices,1,15 on metal oxide films,16–19 and others.20,21
Currently there are two methods for harnessing TTA-UC for solar energy conversion. The first is as an upconversion assisted solar cell where a TTA-UC filter or reflector is used in conjunction with a standard solar cell.11,22–26 The second strategy, an integrated TTA-UC solar cell, incorporates TTA-UC directly into the light absorption and photocurrent generation mechanism.27–29 The later method is particularly appealing because charge extraction occurs prior to emission so the sensitizer concentration (and resulting triplet density) can be significantly increased without concern of self-absorption/inner filtering losses.
The first reported example of an integrated TTA-UC solar cell was introduced by Simpson et al.27 and is based on the heterogeneous TTA-UC scheme of Morandeira and coworkers.18 In this scheme the acceptor molecule is bound to a TiO2 surface in a standard dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) architecture but with a sensitizer dissolved in the electrolyte solution. Recently, we introduced self-assembled multilayers as an alternative strategy to generate an integrated TTA-UC DSSC.28,29 In the multilayer scheme, the sensitizer molecule is coordinated to a surface bound acceptor molecule via metal ion linkages (Fig. 1a).30–32 In the multilayer TTA-UC DSSC, the proposed mechanism begins with excitation of the sensitizer molecule. Then, following intersystem crossing to the triplet excited state, triplet energy is transferred from the sensitizer to the acceptor molecule layer. The triplet excited state then migrates throughout the acceptor monolayer until two triplet acceptors are in close enough proximity to annihilate, with one acceptor returning to the ground state and one promoted to the singlet excited state. The singlet excited state of the acceptor then has sufficient energy to transfer an electron to the conduction band of TiO2 to generate photocurrent. The multilayer device, as compared to the heterogeneous device, exhibited higher photocurrent and overall efficiency which was attributed to more efficient energy transfer (not diffusion limited) and increased sensitizer concentrations (not solubility or non-productive annihilation limited).29
 Fig. 1  Structure of A, PtP, and PdP molecules (a) with the schematic representation of the dual sensitized bilayer (b) and dual sensitized trilayer films (c). 
The solar energy conversion efficiency for current integrated TTA-UC solar cells is limited, at least in part, by the relatively narrow absorption features of the sensitizer molecule. In several solution/polymer based TTA-UC systems, incorporation of multiple sensitizers has been used to increase broad band low energy light absorption.25,33,34 The multiple sensitizers work cooperatively to increase acceptor triplet excited state densities, lower the light intensity necessary to reach the strong annihilation limit, and increase overall TTA-UC efficiency.
With these advantages in mind, herein we incorporate two sensitizer molecules (PtP and PdP in Fig. 1a) into an integrated TTA-UC solar cell via self-assembled bilayer (Fig. 1b) and trilayer (Fig. 1c) films. Photophysical and electrochemical measurements are used to demonstrate that the two sensitizers work cooperatively to achieve peak TTA-UC efficiency at sub-solar irradiance and increase, by two orders of magnitude, the record efficiency for harvesting low energy light in an integrated TTA-UC solar cell.
Experimental
Materials
4,4′-(Anthracene-9,10-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene) diphosphonic acid (A),28 Co(phen)3(PF6)2 and Co(phen)3(PF6)3 (Co3+/2+)35 were prepared by following previously published procedures. Zinc acetate dehydrate, H2PtCl6, nitrosyl tetrafluoroborate, cobalt(II) chloride, ammonium hexafluorophosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), 2,2′-bipyridine (Oxchem), Pd(II) meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (PdP), and Pt(II) meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (PtP) (Frontier Scientific), were purchased from their respective suppliers, in parentheses, and used without further purification. All other reagents and solvents (analytical reagent grade) have been purchased and used without further purification from VWR. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (sheet resistance 15 Ω □−1) was purchased from Hartford Glass Co. Meltonix film (1170-25) and Vac'n Fill Syringe (65209) were purchased from Solaronix. Micro glass cover slides (18 × 18 mm) were obtained from VWR. ZrO2 and TiO2 sol–gel pastes and nanocrystalline films were prepared following previously reported procedures.36–38
Sample preparation-film formation
The bilayer and trilayer films were prepared by step-wise soaking procedure described in our previous report with minor modifications.28 Greater details are given in the results and discussion section. Surface coverages (Γ in mol cm−2) are estimated with the expression Γ = (A(λ)/ε(λ))/1000 where ε is the molar extinction coefficient in DMSO and A(λ) is the maximum absorbance of the slides.39 Sensitizer concentrations in the film, reported in M, were determined from Beer's law using the absorbance, sensitizer extinction coefficient, and the film thickness (3 μm).
Sample preparation-device fabrication
Samples for photophysical measurements were prepared following our previously published procedure with ZrO2 on glass as the metal oxide substrate and oxygen free acetonitrile as the solvent.28 DSSCs were prepared with the multilayer films on TiO2–FTO coated glass as the anode following our previously published procedure29 but with dry and oxygen free acetonitrile containing Co(phen)3(PF6)2 (0.2 M) and Co(phen)3(PF6)3 (0.02 M) as the electrolyte solution.35
Absorption measurements
Absorption spectra were recorded on an Agilent 8453 UV-visible photo diode array spectrophotometer. Extinction coefficients for PdP, PtP, and A in DMSO were determined from the absorption spectra of solutions having a known concentration of chromophore in a 1 × 1 cm quartz cuvette. Thin film absorption spectra were obtained by placing dry, derivatized TiO2 and ZrO2 slides perpendicular to the detection beam path.
Steady-state and time-resolved emission
Emission spectra and lifetimes were collected at room temperature using an Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer. For steady-state emission, the samples were excited using the output from either a housed 450 W Xe lamp/single grating (1800 L mm−1, 250 nm blaze) Czerny–Turner monochromator or a Nd:YAG laser (Aixiz, AD-532-400T). The output from the Nd:YAG laser was passed through a variable neutral density filter (Edinburgh F-B01 laser mount), a 2 mm diameter iris (Newport ID-1.0) and then directed to the sample via a flip mirror. Emission from the sample was first passed through a 532 nm notch filter (Thorlabs Inc., NF533-17), then a single grating (1800 L mm−1, 500 nm blaze) Czerny–Turner monochromator and finally detected by a Peltier-cooled Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube. Laser intensities were measured using a power meter (Ophir Vega 7Z01560) with a high sensitivity power sensor (Ophir 3A-FS 7Z02628). Calculations of the energy transfer efficiency are described in ESI.†
The emission lifetimes for PtP and PdP in the bilayer and directly on the surface of ZrO2 were acquired using the FLS980's multi-channel scaling (MCS) acquisition mode with 515 and 525 nm excitation, respectively, from a 60 W microsecond flashlamp (pulse width < 2.5 μs) at a 100 Hz repetition rate. Emission was passed through a 570 nm long pass filter placed in front of the detector.
Current density–voltage (J–V) curves
Current–voltage data were collected using a CH Instruments CHI630E electrochemical analyzer using a two-electrode configuration (TiO2 working, Pt counter). The samples were irradiated with an AM1.5 solar simulator (Light Model 66181 oriel corrected with a standard air-mass filter) passing through 375 nm (to prevent DPPA dimerization; this filter blocks 5% of solar power) or 495 nm (to isolate the contribution due to upconversion) long pass filters. Current was monitored with respect to voltage from −0.02 to 0.02 V. For intensity dependence measurements, focusing lenses were used to increase the intensity of the light to 10 suns and neutral density filters were used to vary the intensity. Light intensities through each filter were measured using a power meter (Ophir Vega 7Z01560) with a high sensitivity power sensor (Ophir 3A-FS 7Z02628).
Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE)
IPCE spectra were collected using a CH Instruments CHI630E electrochemical analyzer using a two-electrode configuration (TiO2 working, platinum counter) held at 0 V applied potential while monitoring current. The samples were irradiated in 5 nm steps (5 nm bandwidth) using the output from a housed 450 W Xe lamp/single grating (1800 L mm−1, 250 nm blaze) Czerny–Turner monochromator with no white light bias. Intensities (0.4–0.6 mW cm−2) were measured at each wavelength using an Ophir Vega power meter (Ophir Vega 7Z01560) with a high sensitivity power sensor (Ophir 3A-FS 7Z02628). Calculations of the % IPCE are described in ESI.†
Results and discussion
Bilayer and trilayer formation
The bilayer and trilayer films are composed of A, Zn2+ linking ions, PdP and/or PtP (Fig. 1a) and were prepared by a step-wise soaking procedure with each step monitored by UV-vis and/or ATR-IR spectroscopy. The sensitizers, PtP and PdP, were selected because they (1) are each known to exhibit upconversion with diphenylanthracene,1 (2) have complementary, low energy absorption features from 490–530 nm for PtP and 510–550 nm for PdP, and (3) their energetics are appropriate for a PtP to PdP to A triplet energy transfer cascade towards the metal oxide surface.
For all multilayer films, complete monolayer coverage of A (ΓA = 1.14 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for a 3 μm thick film) was achieved by soaking a nanocrystalline TiO2 film in a 200 μM solution of A in DMSO overnight (∼12 hours). Then Zn2+ ions were coordinated to the non-surface bound phosphonate groups of TiO2-A by soaking the film in a solution of 400 μM Zn(CH3COO)2 in methanol for 30 minutes to ensure full coordination.28
Single sensitizer bilayer films were prepared by submerging TiO2-A-Zn in a 100 μM solution of PtP or PdP in DMSO to give TiO2-A-Zn-PtP or TiO2-A-Zn-PdP respectively (Fig. 1a). The concentration of the sensitizer can readily be controlled by varying the treatment time with one hour of soaking with N2 bubbling resulting in a surface coverage of 2.74 × 10−8 mol cm−2 (A to PtP ratio of ∼4:1) and 2.56 × 10−8 mol cm−2 (A to PdP ratio of ∼4:1) for TiO2-A-Zn-PtP and TiO2-A-Zn-PdP respectively.
The dual sensitized bilayer (herein noted as TiO2-A-Zn-PdP/PtP, Fig. 1b) was prepared by first partially loading TiO2-A-Zn with PdP by submerging the film in a 100 μM PdP DMSO solution for 10 minutes such that the film was loaded 50% of maximum loading (S50%). The TiO2-A-Zn-PdP50% film (A to PdP ratio of ∼8:1) was then soaked in a 100 μM PtP DMSO solution for 10 minutes to generate the dual sensitized bilayer, TiO2-A-Zn-PdP/PtP, with an A to PdP to PtP ratio of ∼8:1:1. As can be seen in Fig. 2a and S1a,† the TiO2-A-Zn-PdP/PtP absorption is approximately the sum of partially loaded single sensitizer, TiO2-A-Zn-PtP50% and TiO2-A-Zn-PdP50%, films.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra for the dual sensitized bilayer (a) and trilayer (b) as well as their constituent single sensitizer films on TiO2. The calculated spectra, from the scaled sum of the single sensitized films, are shown as dashed orange lines. 
It is worth noting that similar absorption spectra and ratios are achieved when sensitizer loading steps were reversed (PtP first and PdP second) indicating that there is no preferential binding for one sensitizer over the other. However, the second sensitizer loading time was limited to less than 30 minutes because longer submersion times resulted in decreased absorption of the first sensitizer, presumably due to concentration driven competitive binding/desorption.
Trilayer films (herein noted as TiO2-A-Zn-PdP-Zn-PtP, Fig. 1c) were prepared following our standard bilayer assembly procedure but with additional metal ion and sensitizer loading steps. As alluded to above, PdP and PtP were chosen as the first and second sensitizer layers, respectively, in order to generate an antenna-like structure that facilitates directional triplet energy transfer towards A (vide infra). The treatment of TiO2-A-Zn-PdP with a methanol solution of 400 μM Zn(CH3COO)2 was monitored by ATR-IR and the results are shown in Fig. S2.† The disappearance of the absorbance band of carboxylic acid (νCO at 1702 cm−1) and the increased absorbance and broadening of the asymmetric νCOO− peak at 1604 cm−1 and symmetric νCOO− peak at 1406 cm−1 are indicative of coordination of Zn2+ to the carboxylate group of PdP.40,41 No spectral shifts or decrease in intensity in the absorption features of PdP were observed on UV-vis during Zn2+ treatment indicating that metal ion coordination has minimal effect on the photophysical and electrochemical properties of PdP.
The second sensitizer layer was then formed by soaking TiO2-A-Zn-PdP-Zn in a 100 μM PtP solution of DMSO for 1 hour with N2 bubbling. As can be seen in Fig. 2b and S1b† the absorption spectrum of the resulting film, is approximately the sum of the fully loaded, single sensitizer bilayer films with contributions from both PdP and PtP Q-band absorption features from 480–600 nm. In contrast, in the absence of the second Zn2+ treatment, under standard loading conditions, we observe minimal absorption contribution from PtP. This result suggests that a minimal amount of PtP is co-adsorbed on the TiO2-A-Zn-PdP bilayer. However, given enough soaking time, we observed a decrease in PdP absorption and increase in PtP absorption due to competitive desorption of the first sensitizer layer. The results are consistent with a second Zn2+ ion treatment facilitating the formation of a trilayer film, TiO2-A-Zn-PdP-Zn-PtP (A to PdP to PtP ratio of ∼4:1:1), as depicted in Fig. 1c.
It is worth noting that while the spectral shapes are similar in the low energy region, the trilayer (TiO2-A-Zn-PdP-Zn-PtP) has more than twice the absorbance of the dual sensitized bilayer film (TiO2-A-Zn-PdP/PtP). This is expected given that a ∼1:1 dual sensitized layer limits the concentration of each sensitizer to approximately half of a fully loaded monolayer. The trilayer strategy effectively circumvents this surface area limitation by doubling the amount of sensitizer per unit surface area and results in the highest triplet sensitizer concentration ever achieved in a TTA-UC material (∼18 mM based on extinction coefficients in DMSO and the thickness of the film). Unfortunately, we have no direct structural information about local coordination chemistry and Fig. 1 should be considered as a reasonable but unsupported representation.
Interlayer energy transfer
The proposed mechanism for TTA-UC in the multi-layer films requires interlayer, sensitizer-to-acceptor and sensitizer-to-sensitizer energy transfer. These energy transfer events were quantified by using steady-state and time-resolved emission measurements and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The measurements were performed for the mono- and bilayer films on ZrO2, whose relatively high conduction band potential inhibits emission quenching by excited state electron transfer from the dyes to the semiconductor surface.42 As found for other dynamic processes on nanocrystalline metal oxide interfaces,43 the emission decay kinetics are highly complex. For simplicity, the lifetimes (τ) reported here are the decay half-lives (i.e. the time it takes for half of the initial emission amplitude to decay).
 Fig. 3  Emission spectra for (a) ZrO2-PtP and ZrO2-A-Zn-PtP in MeCN excited at 515 nm (inset: time-resolved emission at 670 nm), and (b) ZrO2-PdP and ZrO2-A-Zn-PdP excited at 525 nm (inset: time-resolved emission at 700 nm). 
As can be seen in Fig. 3a, there is an ∼70% decrease in emission intensity for ZrO2-A-Zn-PtP relative to ZrO2-PtP. This emission quenching is accompanied by a decrease in lifetime from 36 μs to 16 μs (inset Fig. 3a). Similarly, for the PdP sensitized films (Fig. 3b), there is an ∼80% decrease in emission intensity for ZrO2-A-Zn-PdP relative to ZrO2-PdP and a corresponding reduction in lifetime from 112 μs to 52 μs (inset Fig. 3b).
In the absence of energy or electron transfer, the emission lifetime for ZrO2-S (τS), where S is either PtP or PdP, is inversely proportional to the sum of radiative (kr) and non-radiative (knr) rate constants as shown in eqn (1): τS = 1/(kr + knr)(1)
Assuming that triplet sensitizer to acceptor energy transfer (3S* + 1A → 1S + 3A*) is the only additional emission quenching process in ZrO2-A-Zn-S, compared to ZrO2-S, then an energy transfer rate constant (kET) can be calculated by using eqn (2): τA–S = 1/(kr + knr + kET) = 1/((1/τS) + kET)(2)where τA–S is the lifetime for the low energy emission from ZrO2-A-Zn-S. From eqn (1) and (2) and the lifetime data, the energy transfer rate for 3PtP* to 1A and 3PdP* to 1A were calculated to be 3.47 × 104 s−1 and 1.03 × 104 s−1, respectively. Interestingly, despite 3.5-fold greater energy transfer rate for PtP over PdP, the energy transfer efficiency is 10% greater for PdP over PtP films. This demonstrates that while the energy transfer rate is slower for ZrO2-A-Zn-PdP, presumably due to the 0.1 eV lower driving force, the lifetime of PdP is sufficiently long for relatively efficient energy transfer to still occur.
As a side, it is worth noting that ZrO2-A-Zn-PdP bilayer film with an A to PdP ratio of ∼4:1, exhibits 460 nm emission upon 532 nm excitation (2.5 W cm−2) (Fig. S3†). These results indicate that both PdP and, as previously reported,28PtP are effective sensitizers for A and can facilitate TTA-UC emission in the self-assembled bilayer films.
To measure this 3PtP* to 1PdP energy transfer rate in the multilayer assembly we generated a ZrO2-PdP-Zn-PtP bilayer film following the trilayer film preparation procedure described above but without the initial A or Zn2+ treatments. Upon preferential excitation of PtP at 505 nm, there is an ∼90% decrease in emission intensity from PtP in ZrO2-PdP-Zn-PtP relative to ZrO2-PtP as well as a decrease in lifetime from 40 μs to 25 μs (Fig. S4†). In a calculation analogous to those described above, the 3PtP* to 1PdP energy transfer rate was found to be 1.5 × 104 s−1.
The above results indicate that in the dual sensitized bilayer film, MO2-A-Zn-PdP/PtP, 3A can be generated by both 3PtP* to 1A and 3PdP* to 1A energy transfer. In the trilayer film, 3A is generated by either excitation of PdP followed by 3PdP* to 1A energy transfer, or by excitation of PtP followed by stepwise 3PtP* to 1PdP and then 3PdP* to 1A energy transfer. We cannot rule out direct 3PtP* to 1A energy transfer in the trilayer film but given that for Dexter energy transfer there is an exponential decrease in energy transfer rate with respect to distance, we anticipate it will be slower than the energy cascade pathway.

J–V and IPCE measurements
TTA-UC dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were prepared in a standard DSSC sandwich cell architecture with bilayer and trilayer films as the photoanode, a platinum counter electrode, and a Tris-(2,2′-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III)(hexafluorophosphate) (Co3+/2+) based redox mediator in dry acetonitrile as the electrolyte solution. The relative energetics of TiO2, A, PdP, PtP, and Co3+/2+ are summarized in Fig. 4. Co3+/2+ was chosen as the redox mediator, at least in part, because it lacks absorption features in the visible region (Fig. S5†). It is important to note that while electron transfer from the triplet excited states of PdP, PtP and A to TiO2 is energetically unfavorable, the singlet excited state of A readily injects electrons into the conduction band of TiO2.28
 Fig. 4  Electronic transitions and energetics for TiO2, A, PdP, PtP, and Co3+/2+ (vs. NHE) in the TTA-UC DSSC (1X = singlet state, 3X = triplet state, nX* = excited state, ISC = intersystem crossing, ET = triplet energy transfer, TTA = triplet–triplet annihilation, e− = electron transfer, regen = reduction of the oxidized dye by the mediator). 
Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements for DSSCs with both bilayer and trilayer films were measured under AM1.5 solar irradiation. The light was first passed through a 495 nm long pass filter to isolate the contribution of low energy light absorption and TTA-UC to the device performance and the results are summarized in Fig. 5 and Table S1.† In accord with our previous report, the short circuit current Jsc for these films can be directly attributed to a TTA-UC photocurrent generation mechanism.28
 Fig. 5  Photocurrent density–voltage characteristics for DSSCs with anodes composed of (a) dual sensitized bilayer (A:PdP:PtP of 10:1:1) and (b) trilayer (A:PdP:PtP of 4:1:1) as well as their constituent single sensitizer films on TiO2 under AM1.5 irradiation with a 495 nm long-pass filter. 
The J–V curve for the dual sensitized bilayer, TiO2-A-Zn-PdP/PtP (A:PdP:PtP of 10:1:1), and singly sensitized bilayers with comparable PdP50% (A:PdP of 10:1) or PtP50% (A:PtP of 8:1) loading, can be seen in Fig. 5a. The TiO2-A-Zn-PdP/PtP device has a Jsc (20.2 μA cm−2) that is ∼20% larger than the sum of TiO2-A-Zn-PdP50% (7.8 μA cm−2) and TiO2-A-Zn-PtP50% (8.0 μA cm−2) devices. The films were prepared such that the low energy absorption from the dual sensitized bilayer is equal to the sum of the partially loaded, single sensitizer films. For a standard one photon to one electron device, with no competitive absorption, the total number of excited states would be equal and, at most, we would expect a Jsc that is the sum of the individual sensitizer devices. However, TTA-UC is a multiphoton process that, in this case, is operating in the quadratic regime under low intensity light. In the TiO2-A-Zn-PdP/PtP film, the sensitizers presumably work cooperatively to increase the total 3A* density and increase the efficiency of TTA-UC which manifests here as a 20% increase relative to the summed Jsc for each partially loaded film. A similar multisensitizer cooperative increase has been observed for TTA-UC emission.25,33,44,45 The efficiency (η = (unflitered incident light power/electrical power output) × 100) of the TiO2-A-Zn-PdP/PtP device (η = 1.1 × 10−4%) is nearly an order of magnitude higher than our previously reported fully loaded TiO2-A-Zn-PtP (η = 1.6 × 10−5%) device presumably due to the increased broad band absorption for the multi-sensitizer film.25
It is important to note that, in addition to being limited by the TTA-UC efficiency, these power conversion efficiencies are also dependent on the electron injection efficiency, charge collection efficiency, and regeneration efficiency. As such the power conversion efficiency is only a low end estimate of the TTA-UC efficiency.
The J–V curve for the trilayer, TiO2-A-Zn-PdP-Zn-PtP (A:PdP:PtP of 4:1:1), and fully loaded singly sensitized bilayers, can be seen in Fig. 5b. The trilayer device exhibits a Jsc of 74.1 μA cm−2 which is the highest photocurrent yet achieved for an integrated TTA-UC solar cell. However, unlike the dual sensitized bilayer, the photocurrent for the trilayer is less than the sum of the TiO2-A-Zn-PdP (50.6 μA cm−2) and TiO2-A-Zn-PtP (37.3 μA cm−2) devices. The less than unity 3PtP* to 1PdP energy transfer efficiency likely contributes to the nominal Jsc increase and less productive multisensitizer, cooperative effect that was seen in the dual sensitized bilayer device, as not all of the energy from the PdP is transferred to the acceptor molecule. Also, given the less positive redox potential of PdP compared to PtP (Table S2†) the cation generated after electron injection likely resides on PdP which may result in slower kregen due to steric hindrance by PtP. Regardless, the photocurrent and efficiency for the trilayer device are >3 times and >10 times larger, respectively, than the dual sensitized bilayer (Table S1†). The efficiency of the trilayer device (1.2 × 10−3%) is nearly two orders of magnitude more efficient than our previously reported TiO2-A-Zn-PtP (1.6 × 10−5%) device,29 and is currently the highest yet reported for an integrated TTA-UC solar cell.
The significantly higher efficiency in the trilayer film can, at least in part, be attributed to it having a larger Voc than any of the bilayer films. In a DSSC, the maximum Voc is dictated by the energy difference between the Fermi level of the electrons within TiO2 and the redox potential of Co3+/2+.46 Given that all the cells are composed of the same redox mediator, we attribute the increase in Voc to two factors. The first is the higher photon-to-injected electron yield in the trilayer film resulting in increased electron density in the conduction band of TiO2. Second is the slowed recombination (i.e. TiO2(e−) to Co3+ electron transfer) as has been observed with other multilayer DSSCs.36,47,48 Presumably the larger steric hindrance afforded by the trilayer film effectively increases the average distance between the electrons in TiO2 and Co3+, which in turn slows unwanted recombination.
To further support that both sensitizers are involved in photocurrent generation we performed incident photon-to-current efficiency measurements (IPCE) and the results can be seen in Fig. 6 and S7† for the dual sensitized tri- and bilayer films respectively.
 Fig. 6  IPCE (filled squares) and absorptance (empty circles) for DSSCs composed of photoanodes of TiO2-A-Zn-X where X is indicated in the top right corner of each spectrum. 
For all of the films, the IPCE spectra closely resemble their respective absorptance spectra and the area under the IPCE spectra are in good agreement with the trends in Jsc values in Fig. 5 and Table S1.† For both the dual sensitized bilayer and the trilayer, the IPCE spectra are broadened due to photocurrent contributions from both PtP (λmax = 512 nm) and PdP (λmax = 525 nm) but with the peak IPCE in the trilayer (1.28%) being five times that of the dual sensitized bilayer (0.25%). These results, combined with the energy transfer measurements above, suggest that both PtP and PdP effectively sensitize A, which can then undergo TTA-UC, charge separation, and photocurrent generation in both the dual sensitized bilayer and trilayer architectures.
Excitation intensity dependence
Short circuit photocurrent (V = 0) with respect to excitation intensities from a 532 nm laser and an AM1.5 solar simulator were acquired for the bilayer and trilayer DSSCs and the results can be seen in Fig. 7. Excitation intensity dependence measurements are common in photon upconversion studies because they provide two valuable pieces of information. The first is that a change in slope from 2 at low intensity (quadratic, weak annihilation limit) to 1 at high intensities (linear, strong annihilation limit) is a clear indicator of a TTA-UC process.49–52 The second is the determination of the crossover point between a slope of 2 and 1, also known as the Ith value.49 The Ith value is the lowest light intensity where TTA-UC reaches peak efficiency for a given system and is dictated by several variables as described in eqn (3): (3)where kTA is the decay constant of the acceptor triplet state, α(E) is the sensitizer absorption coefficient in cm−1, γTT is the second order annihilation constant, and Φtr is the sensitizer to acceptor energy transfer quantum yield.
 Fig. 7  Photocurrent density with respect to excitation intensities from a 532 nm laser (a) and an AM1.5 solar simulator with a 495 nm long-pass filter (b) for DSSCs composed of the trilayer (TiO2-A-Zn-PdP-Zn-PtP), PtP (TiO2-A-Zn-PtP), and PdP (TiO2-A-Zn-PdP) bilayers. 
Under 532 nm laser excitation both the fully loaded PtP and PdP bilayer films exhibit a slope change from ∼2 to 1 at Ith values of 10 mW cm−2 and 5 mW cm,−2 respectively (Fig. 7a). The lower Ith value for the PdP film can be attributed to the more than two-fold higher absorption for PdP than PtP at 532 nm (Fig. 2b). Interestingly for the trilayer device (TiO2-A-Zn-PdP-Zn-PtP), we were unable to measure current at a sufficiently low light intensity to observe the quadratic regime. This indicates that the cooperative absorption of PdP and PtP significantly lowers the Ith value to <1 mW cm−2.
Given that laser excitation measurements do not account for broad absorption features of the sensitizer molecules, we also measured the photocurrent of the bilayer and trilayer DSSCs with respect to the AM1.5 solar spectrum intensity (Fig. 7b). The excitation power densities reported in Fig. 7b are for the entire solar spectrum (i.e. 1 sun = 100 mW cm−2) but the light was passed through a 495 nm filter before hitting the DSSCs to isolate the contribution of low energy light absorption and photocurrent generated from TTA-UC.
Under these measurement conditions none of the three samples reach the quadratic regime (slope = 2). The slopes under low light intensity are 1.7, 1.4, and 1.3 and the intersection of the linear and supra-linear regimes occurs at 42 mW cm−2 (0.42 suns), 78 mW cm−2 (0.78 suns), and 62 mW cm−2 (0.62 suns) for the PtP bilayer, PdP bilayer, and trilayer DSSCs respectively. Given that the low energy slopes never reach the quadratic regime, presumably these are the low end estimates of the Ith values with the true Ith value decreasing in the order PtP > PdP > trilayer. Regardless, all three samples reach the linear, strong annihilation limit at intensities less than solar flux (100 mW cm−2).
Conclusions
Here we have introduced self-assembled bilayer and trilayers as a new strategy for incorporating multiple sensitizers into a TTA-UC film/DSSC. Interlayer energy transfer from both sensitizers in the bilayer, and in energy cascade for the trilayer, are an effective means of absorbing low energy light and generating acceptor triplet excited states. A photocurrent enhancement is observed in the multi-sensitizer films due to cooperative broadband absorption as indicated by J–V and IPCE measurements. The efficiency of the trilayer device (1.2 × 10−3%) is currently the highest yet reported for an integrated TTA-UC solar cell. Intensity dependence measurements demonstrate that high triplet densities and peak UC efficiency can be achieved at subsolar irradiance using dual sensitized self-assembled multi-layer films. It is important to note that even though these systems have reached the peak TTA-UC efficiency under ambient solar intensities, the TTA-UC and device efficiency is still low (1.2 × 10−3% with <495 nm irradiance).
There are a number of ways to improve TTA-UC efficiency in the multilayer films including increasing sensitizer-to-acceptor triplet energy transfer efficiency and limiting acceptor-to-sensitizer singlet energy transfer. Additional improvements can readily be made in the DSSC performance including optimizing overlap between the sensitizer(s) and the solar spectrum, increasing injection yield from the singlet excited state of the acceptor molecule, maximizing the regeneration rate, and mitigating triplet quenching losses. It is worth noting that if arranged appropriately for an energy transfer cascade, there is no reason that more than two sensitizer molecules could not be incorporated into the multilayer film further improving broad band light absorption.25 We are optimistic that with any/all of the changes above, an integrated TTA-UC DSSC offers a viable means of improving solar energy harvesting efficiencies.
