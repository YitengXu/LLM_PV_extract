    , Accepted 3rd December 2015First published on 3rd December 2015AbstractIn this study, we report the preparation of a novel ternary hybrid consisting of reduced graphene oxide/CdS nanowires decorated with Pt nanoparticles (rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs) as an efficient electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic ethanol oxidation platform in alkaline medium. The synthesis was accomplished by a solvothermal method in the first step to prepare uniformly sized CdS NWs with diameters of 35 nm and lengths up to several micrometers, followed by a simple hydrothermal method to assemble CdS NWs decorated with Pt NPs onto rGO sheets using hydrazine as a reducing agent. Data regarding the morphology, structure and properties of the prepared nanocomposite were obtained through various characterization techniques including field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-visible and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). Assessing the electrocatalytic activity using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and amperometry techniques revealed that the ternary hybrid (rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs) exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity toward ethanol oxidation in alkaline solution with a more negative onset potential compared to nanostructures with various components such as CdS NWs, rGO/CdS NWs, CdS NWs/Pt NPs and rGO/Pt NPs. Furthermore, experiments using low-power LED as a visible-light illumination source showed a dramatic increase in the electrocatalytic activity of the proposed nanohybrid toward ethanol oxidation accompanied by a shift of the onset potential to a more negative potential of −0.950 V vs. Ag/AgCl compared to −0.870 V in dark condition. This high electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic performance can be ascribed to providing maximum interfacial contact of CdS NWs with rGO, which decreases the agglomeration of nanostructures and suppresses the photogenerated electron–hole recombination. Furthermore, accelerated electron transfer in the presence of rGO and enhanced specific surface area achieved by uniform deposition of Pt NPs onto CdS NWs contribute to increasing the catalytic activity. This research could promise a simple strategy toward the synthesis of a one-dimensional semiconductor–rGO/Pt ternary hybrid and its applications as an efficient visible-light photocatalyst for different chemical transformation and energy conversion devices.
Introduction
The development of direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) has been widely studied to convert their stored chemical energy into electrical energy with high utilization efficiency and low polluting emissions.1,2 Ethanol is a promising fuel in DAFCs due to its low toxicity, high boiling point for safe storage in transportation applications, the nature of the 12-electron transfer upon complete oxidation, which results in its higher energy density (8 kW h kg−1) compared to methanol (6.09 kW h kg−1) and formic acid (1.740 kW h kg−1), and also being a green and renewable resource which can be easily produced from agricultural products or biomass in a large scale.3–11 In particular, direct ethanol alkaline fuel cells (DEAFCs) have attracted much interest in recent years.5–11 Alkaline electrolytes offer unique properties for efficient ethanol electrooxidation, such as enhanced electrochemical kinetics at low anodic overpotential and lower risk of corrosion of materials for long-term applications, reduced fuel crossover from the anode to the cathode via electro-osmotic drag of hydrated hydroxyl ions, and the possibility of using both precious and non-precious metal catalysts.5–11
It is well known that Pt and its alloys are among the most efficient electrocatalysts in the anodic oxidation of fuels due to their excellent properties in the adsorption and dissociation of small organic molecules such as ethanol and methanol.9,12,13 However, the high amount of Pt usage and its high cost are main issues that need to be addressed in the energy conversion field. In this respect, loading the Pt catalyst particles on suitable carriers has been a choice extensively pursued by many researchers in order to achieve both high catalytic performance and lower cost. Graphene, an atomic-layer-thick 2D material with excellent conductivity, high chemical stability and large surface area (2600 m2 g−1) is a material of choice which has been applied as a promoter and a catalyst support to construct highly effective electrodes for fuel cells or corrosion resistance devices.11–17
On the other hand, great research efforts have been input over the recent years to design photoelectrocatalytic systems as alternatives to the conventional electrocatalytic processes. To date, many semiconductors including TiO2, WO3, CuO, SrTiO3, etc. have been applied in photoelectrocatalytic reactions for energy conversion and photo fuel cell (PFC) design. Cadmium sulfide (CdS), an important semiconductor with a relatively narrow band gap of 2.52 eV at room temperature, has attracted considerable interest in photocatalysis,18–23 photoelectrochemical cells,24 light-emitting diodes,25 water splitting,26 solar cells,27,28 photosynthesis29 and photo fuel cells (PFCs).30 Chemical and physical properties of CdS could be realized by controlling the particle sizes and its microstructure or decorating with other metal nanoparticles.18 Furthermore, the stability of the CdS nanostructure improved with controlling of synthesis conditions.31 Nonetheless, its rapid recombination rate of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and easy aggregation of CdS nanoparticles reduce the specific surface area and reactive sites, which leads to poor photoelectrocatalytic activity.32 The coupling of CdS with other wide band gap semiconductors such as graphene oxide (GO) has been adopted to solve these drawbacks. In addition, the integration of Pt NPs onto semiconductor–graphene nanocomposites has been shown to possess superior catalytic or photocatalytic activity and larger durability for electrocatalytic oxidation of fuels or hydrogen evolution processes.1,32 However, CdS NPs have poor interfacial contact with the graphene surface due to the nearly spherical shape of NPs and their tendency to agglomerate. Therefore, the preparation of a form of CdS nanostructures such as CdS NWs that provide higher interfacial contact with graphene without aggregation is a key factor to enhance the photocatalytic or photoelectrocatalytic performance of CdS–graphene nanocomposites.
On the basis of the above discussion, in this work, we have reported the synthesis of a novel ternary hybrid composed of rGO/CdS NWs decorated with Pt NPs. A simple one-step hydrothermal strategy was utilized for the assembly of CdS NWs onto GO and in situ reduction of PtCl42− and GO to form uniformly distributed Pt NPs onto CdS NWs/rGO using hydrazine as a reducing agent (Scheme 1). The prepared rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs nanocomposite was fully characterized by different microscopic, spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques and its electrocatalytic activity toward ethanol oxidation was evaluated in alkaline medium. Control experiments were designed and performed with different single and double-hybrid nanomaterials such as CdS NWs, rGO/CdS NWs, CdS NWs/Pt NPs and rGO/Pt NPs to show the enhanced electrocatalytic performance of the proposed ternary hybrid. Furthermore, the photoelectrocatalytic activity of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs nanocomposite toward ethanol oxidation was investigated under visible light illumination using low-power LED as a light source. Interestingly, with the assistance of visible light illumination, a large potential shift toward more negative values was observed for the onset potential of ethanol oxidation, accompanied by a three-fold increase in electrocatalytic current and great improvement in the stability of the photocatalyst. The interesting electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic behavior of the prepared ternary hybrid demonstrated in the obtained results has its origin in the higher interfacial contact of 1D CdS NWs with rGO, leading to a decrease in the agglomeration and suppression of photogenerated electron–hole recombination,19,33 as well as the uniform distribution of Pt NPs onto CdS NWs, providing a large specific surface area and thus an increase in the catalytic activity.

Experimental section
Chemicals and materials
Graphite powder, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate (C5H10NNaS2·3H2O), ethylenediamine (C2H8N2) and hydrazine (N2H4) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Ethanol (C2H5OH), potassium tetrachloroplatinate(IV) (K2PtCl4), cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck and Sigma-Aldrich. High-purity deionized (DI) water was used throughout the experiments.
Instruments and experimental techniques
The electro- and photoelectrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature with Autolab (PGSTAT30), potentiostat/galvanostat and Metrohm (Type 1.757.0010) instruments connected to a three-electrode cell linked to a computer (Pentium IV, 1200 MHz) and the cell linked to the instrument software. A conventional three-electrode cell was used for all experiments. A modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode was used as the working electrode, and platinum wire and Ag/AgCl/KCl (sat'd) were used as auxiliary and reference electrodes, respectively. Before each electrochemical measurement, the solution was well purged with N2 to remove oxygen. EIS measurements were carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell powered by an electrochemical system comprising the ZAHNER (model IM6ex, Germany). The system was run on a PC using THALES USB software. For these measurements, a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz was employed and the AC voltage amplitude was 5 mV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with a MIRA3 TESCAN HV: 20.0 kV instrument (Czech Republic). UV-vis and fluorescence spectra were recorded on a SPECTROD 250 Analytik Jena spectrophotometer (Germany) and an EL01044753-Varian spectrophotometer (USA), respectively. XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a copper source and a general area detector diffraction system (GADDS). XPS was performed using an Omicron Nanotechnology system equipped with an EA 125 Energy Analyzer and a DAR 400 X-ray source. The TEM/STEM images were obtained using a FEI Tecnai Osiris scanning transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV. Elemental mapping analysis was carried out by high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM EDS.
Preparation of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs
GO was synthesized using a modified Hummer's method33 with details given in the ESI.† The rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs has been fabricated by a facile template-free two-step solvothermal method, as illustrated in Scheme 1.

(a) Synthesis of CdS NWs. 
Uniform CdS NWs were grown through a modified previously reported method.20,34 In a typical process, 1.124 g of cadmium diethyldithiocarbamate (Cd(S2CNEt2)2), prepared by precipitation from a stoichiometric mixture of sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate and cadmium chloride in deionized water, was added to a 50 mL capacity Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave containing 40 mL of ethylenediamine. The autoclave was maintained at 180 °C for 24 h and then allowed to cool to room temperature. A yellowish precipitate (shown in Fig. S1A (ESI†)) was collected and washed with absolute ethanol and deionized water to remove residual organic solvents. The final products of CdS NWs were dried in an oven at 60 °C.


(b) Synthesis of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs. 
First, 2.5 mg of GO was well dispersed in 30 mL of distilled water by ultrasonication. Similarly, fine dispersions of 14 mg of CdS NWs in 15 mL of ethanol and 6.2 mg of K2PtCl4 in 10 mL of distilled water were prepared separately with the aid of ultrasonication. Then, these solutions were mixed together well by stirring and sonication. After adding 350 μL of hydrazine as a reducing agent while stirring, the above solution was transferred into a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave with a Teflon liner and kept at 180 °C for 15 h. The dark slime green precipitates (shown in Fig. S1B (ESI†)) thus obtained were collected, washed thoroughly with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried in an oven at 60 °C. The amounts of rGO and CdS NWs for the synthesis of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs nanocomposite were ∼13 wt% and ∼72 wt%, respectively. For the synthesis of quantum dots/graphene nanocomposite, usage of ≥5% rGO and ≥70% CdS nanostructures is common.22,33,35,36
For control experiments, rGO/CdS NWs, CdS NWs/Pt NPs and rGO/Pt NPs nanocomposites were also synthesized by the method just described but without adding the platinum salt precursor, GO and CdS NWs, respectively. To prepare the modified GC electrodes, a specified amount of each composite was well dispersed in 2 mL of absolute ethanol by stirring and sonication. Then, 2 μL of the dispersed solution was placed on the electrode surface and allowed to dry at room temperature. This operation was repeated 3 times for each electrode modification.

Results and discussion
Characterization of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs composite

Fig. 1 shows typical SEM images of CdS NWs and rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs composites. As can be seen in Fig. 1A and B, the as-prepared CdS NWs are in the form of almost uniformly sized individual 1D NWs with an average diameter of ca. 35 ± 3 nm and length of 2.5 ± 0.6 μm. Also, it is evident from Fig. 1C–E that a large quantity of small spherical Pt NPs are well distributed within the rGO/CdS NWs composite and all the outlines of CdS NWs, rGO and Pt NPs can be clearly seen. Further characterization of the rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs nanocomposite is shown in the EDX image in Fig. S2 (ESI†) which confirms the existence of Pt, Cd, S and C elements in the composite structure.

The crystallinity of the as-prepared CdS NWs and rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs nanocomposite is examined by XRD and the data are shown in Fig. 2. The peaks marked with “#” can be indexed to hexagonal wurtzite CdS (PDF, 74-9663), while additional peaks denoted by “*” and “▼” correspond to cubic Pt (PDF, 87-0636) and the (002) planes of rGO, respectively. The as-prepared CdS NWs exhibit diffraction peaks, in terms of CdS framework, in which the peaks at 2θ values of 24.8°, 26.5°, 28.2°, 36.6°, 43.7°, 47.9°, 50.9°, 51.8°, 52.8°, 58.9°, 66.8°, 69.2°, 70.9°, and 75.4° can be attributed to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200), (112), (201), (202), (203), (210), (211) and (212) crystal planes of hexagonal wurtzite CdS (PDF, 74-9663), respectively.20,34 All diffraction peaks are indexed to pure CdS with hexagonal crystal structure with lattice constants of a = 0.4136 and c = 0.6716 nm (PDF, 74-9663). In addition, for rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs nanocomposite, two diffraction peaks observed at 39.4° and 46.0° correspond to the (111) and (200) diffraction planes of cubic Pt with a lattice constant of 0.394 nm (PDF, 87-0636), individually.32 These results are indicative of the successful deposition of Pt NPs on the rGO/CdS NW composite.

TEM was also used for characterizing the structure of the synthesized CdS NWs after being decorated with Pt NPs. Fig. 3A–C reveals the uniform decoration of 3–5 nm Pt NPs on the surface of CdS NWs. To further examine the crystal structure of NWs, they were characterized by electron diffraction and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Fig. 3D). As can be seen, the NWs are straight with an almost constant diameter along the entire nanowire length. The HRTEM images and corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns recorded with electron beams perpendicular to the long axis of the NWs at three different positions are shown in Fig. 3Da–c. Clear lattice fringes can be seen for all three positions of NWs, confirming their highly crystalline nature with an interplanar lattice spacing of ∼0.335 nm parallel to the nanowire axis, corresponding to the interplanar distance of (002) planes of CdS with hexagonal crystal structure. Measuring the position of sharp diffraction spots in the corresponding SAED patterns provides further evidence for the crystalline nature of the NWs and growth along the c-axis.

To further investigate the composition and distribution of different elements on the nanostructure composite, elemental mapping was performed by high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM EDS. The HRTEM images with low and high magnification for the rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs nanocomposite and elemental mapping for these cases are presented in Fig. 4 and 5 and Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†). It can be clearly seen that both Cd and S elements are uniformly distributed throughout the NWs. The distribution of the C and Pt elements also clearly support the presence of graphene sheets (Fig. 4 and S3†) and the anchored Pt NPs on the surface of the NWs and rGO sheets (Fig. 4 and 5), respectively. Furthermore, larger Pt NPs with diameters of 80–90 nm decorated onto graphene due to agglomeration of thin Pt NPs. In addition, higher resolution elemental mapping and line scan also evidently show the uniform distribution of both Cd and S elements over the individual NWs (Fig. 6). The synergetic effect of CdS NWs in the proposed nanocomposite toward ethanol oxidation increased. The UV-vis spectra of CdS NWs and rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs nanocomposites are shown in Fig. S5A.† As illustrated for CdS NWs, two absorption peaks are observed at 488 and 500 nm which is consistent with previous reports.37,38 This observation indicates that the CdS NWs can successfully absorb blue and green wavelengths. For rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs nanocomposites, the absorption intensity decreased due to the presence of Pt NPs and rGO in the structure of the nanocomposite. Fig. S5B and C† presents the recorded photoluminescence spectra at excitation wavelengths of 403 and 488 nm, respectively, for both CdS NWs and rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs. As illustrated in Fig. S5B,† under an excitation wavelength of 403 nm for CdS NWs, a sharp peak at 548 nm with two smaller peaks at 528 and 532 nm were observed, in agreement with previous works.20,38 These peaks can be assigned to near-band-edge emission and are associated with structural defects that may arise from an excess of sulfur or defects on the nanowire surfaces.20,37,38 In the case of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs, the same photoluminescence peaks, but with lower intensities, were observed. Since 488 nm was the observed absorption wavelength in the UV-vis spectra of CdS NWs and rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs, the fluorescence spectra were also recorded at 488 nm as the excitation wavelength. As can be seen in Fig. S5C,† two emission peaks at 518 and 528 nm are observable for CdS NWs. The same peaks were also observed for rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs, but with less intensity. As previously reported, graphene oxides do not display finite luminescence, but it can quench the photoluminescence of other photo display materials.39 Therefore, the reducing of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs fluorescence compared to CdS NWs can be due to the existence of graphene. It can be concluded from these UV-vis and fluorescence data that CdS NWs and rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs can absorb the blue and green wavelengths of the visible electromagnetic radiation.

XPS was also employed to obtain more information about the oxidation state of platinum NPs and the percentage of Pt in the nanocomposite. The XPS spectrum of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs is shown in Fig. 7. Apart from the cadmium, sulfur, carbon and oxygen bands, a distinct band is observed at the binding energy (BE) of about 75 attributed to platinum. The percentage of Pt in the nanocomposite is calculated to be 1.96%. The recorded high resolution scan of the Pt 4f peak (inset of Fig. 7) reveals that this peak is a combination of two pairs of doublets. The most intense doublet (71.22 and 74.42 eV) is associated to metallic Pt and the analysis of the peak area shows that 35% of Pt NPs were in the metallic state (Pt0). The second set of doublets at BE of 72.92 and 76.22 eV can be attributed to Pt(II).12,13 These results clearly indicate that the Pt NPs were successfully loaded on the surface of rGO and CdS NWs.

Electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol in alkaline medium
The electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol was carried out on glassy carbon electrodes modified with different nanocomposites including CdS NWs, rGO/Pt NPs, rGO/CdS NWs, CdS NWs/Pt NPs and rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs. The electrocatalytic activity of different nanocomposite-based modified electrodes for the oxidation of ethanol was investigated by recording CVs in an aqueous solution of KOH (2.0 M), with or without 3.0 M C2H5OH, in the potential window of −1.1 to 0.3 V. Furthermore, the photo-assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol was also carried out under the same experimental conditions under visible-light irradiation using a 1 W blue LED lamp as the illumination source. As can be seen in Fig. 8A (voltammograms “a” and “b”), when ethanol was absent, the same redox response was observed for rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs in the dark and under light irradiation. After adding ethanol to the alkaline solution (Fig. 8A, voltammogram “c”), a typical ethanol oxidation peak was observed at −0.38 V with the onset potential at −0.87 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Surprisingly, after illumination with the blue LED lamp, not only a three-fold increase was noticed in the current response, but also the onset potential shifted to −0.95 V (Fig. 8A, voltammogram “d”). The possible pathways for ethanol oxidation in the dark and under visible light irradiation are shown in Scheme 2. As shown, different pathways are available for electron transfer under blue LED light irradiation. To look into the influence of CdS NWs on the electrocatalytic or photoelectrocatalytic activity of nanocomposites toward ethanol oxidation, the CV of the GC electrode modified with rGO/Pt NPs is also shown (Fig. 8B). As can be seen for this modified electrode, the onset and the peak potentials of ethanol oxidation were observed at −0.57 V and −0.25 V, respectively. The positive shift (0.30 V and 0.13 V in the onset and peak potentials, respectively) on rGO/Pt NPs compared to rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs nanocomposites clearly indicates the synergetic effect of CdS NWs toward ethanol oxidation especially under light illumination. These results indicate that the addition of CdS NWs to rGO could greatly increase the surface areas available for Pt NPs and improve the catalytic activity of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs compared to rGO/Pt NPs. Furthermore, the decoration of rGO with CdS NWs that decreased the aggregation of rGO is another factor which improved the synergetic effect of CdS NWs on the catalytic process. In addition, due to the photoactivity of CdS NWs under visible light irradiation, the synergetic effect of CdS NWs on the proposed nanocomposite toward ethanol oxidation increased.

(B) CV for GC electrode modified with rGO/Pt NPs; the pink line is in 2.0 M KOH at scan rate of 50 mV s−1 and the blue line is in the presence of 3.0 M ethanol. 
 Scheme 2  Schematic illustration for photoassisted electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol by using rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs electrode under blue LED light irradiation. A, B and C are the possible pathways of electron transfer in the presence of blue LED light irradiation and A is the possible pathway of electron transfer in the absence of irradiation. 
Fig. S6† presents the recorded CVs of a GC electrode modified solely with CdS NWs in 2.0 M KOH solution, with or without 3.0 M ethanol. Obviously, there was no current response without ethanol in both situations of absence and presence of visible light irradiation. Ethanol addition also did not change the current response under dark conditions, while under blue LED lamp irradiation, an increase in current was observed. This increase is related to the formation of electron–hole pairs in CdS and the presence of a reducing agent such as ethanol capable of donating electrons to the hole. As a result, ethanol can be oxidized by the holes that are formed during illumination. Indeed, under irradiation, the electrons transferred from the valence band to the conduction band followed by transferring to the electrode, which led to an increase in the current.19,39 Similar behavior has been reported for the oxidation of tyrosine by nanoporous TiO2 in alkaline medium under irradiation with a Xe lamp.40
Additional control experiments using different modified electrodes further validate the much superior electrocatalytic or photoelectrocatalytic performance of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs modified electrode toward ethanol oxidation. Fig. 9 shows the CVs of GC electrodes modified with CdS NWs, rGO/CdS NWs, CdS NWs/Pt NPs, rGO/Pt NPs and rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs in alkaline ethanol solution. As shown, no recognizable redox response was observed for CdS NW, rGO/CdS NW and CdS NWs/Pt NP modified electrodes, while the rGO/Pt NP modified electrode displayed a typical ethanol oxidation peak at −0.23 V with an onset potential of −0.57 V and current density of 0.9 mA cm−2. The electroctalytic oxidation of alcohols on platinum nano-catalysts deposited on reduced graphene oxides have been reported.41,42

These results clearly indicate that rGO plays a crucial role in improving the electrocatalytic activity of the nanocomposite toward ethanol oxidation by increasing the surface conductivity as well as electron transfer kinetics. In the case of the rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs modified electrode, the onset and peak potentials shifted to −0.870 and −0.38 V, respectively, and current density increased to 1.12 mA cm−2. Under light irradiation, a yet further improvement was experienced in a way that the current density was increased to 3.63 mA cm−2 and the onset potential was decreased to −0.95 V. This could be due to the synergism between the components (rGO, Pt NPs and CdS NWs) that dominates the electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis phenomena during the ethanol oxidation process. The current density, peak and onset potentials toward ethanol oxidation are summarized in Table 1 for different electrodes of rGO/Pt and rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs in the dark and under light irradiation. The low onset potential and peak potential for rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs in both the dark and illuminated conditions signify the easy oxidation of ethanol at the rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs modified electrode. Also, the high ratio of forward peak current density to backward peak current density (If/Ib) indicates a strong resistance against poisoning from intermediates generated during the electrooxidation of ethanol.9,14Table 2 lists the various characteristic parameters of our proposed nanocomposite and some other systems reported in the literature. It is obvious that the herein obtained data for ethanol oxidation in alkaline medium are better than in some cases or comparable with reported values of other Pt catalysis-based works.

Further evidence for improved electron transfer kinetics of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs nanocomposite was provided by CV and EIS experiments using Fe(CN)6−4/−3 as a redox probe (Fig. 10). As shown, in the case of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs, the redox response increased and peak potential separation decreased in the recorded voltammograms, while charge transfer resistance (Rct) in the EIS measurement was dramatically decreased. Indeed, the presence of rGO in the nanocomposite structure efficiently facilitated its electron transfer characteristics.

(B) EIS Nyquist spectra of CdS NWs (black line), CdS NWs/Pt NPs (red line), rGO/CdS NWs (green line) and rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs (blue line) electrodes in 3.0 mM [Fe(CN)6]−3/−4 and 0.1 M KCl. The frequency range and applied potential for the recorded plots were 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz and 0.22 V, respectively. 
The transient photocurrent response is commonly employed to evaluate the separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs because the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers is the key factor determining the overall photoactivity associated with semiconductor-based materials.1,19Fig. 11A shows the cyclic “on” and “off” formation of light-induced photocurrents at the rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs electrode as current–time (I–t) curves during periodic light irradiations. Apparently, under visible light illumination, the photocurrent response rapidly increases up to a value of 1.12 mA cm−2 and then comes back to its original value of 0.23 mA cm−2 when the light is turned off again. This observation confirms that an effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs occurs at the rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs electrode. This manner can also be observed at other modified electrodes of CdS NWs, rGO/CdS NWs and CdS NWs/Pt NPs with the difference that in these latter cases, the photocurrent increase is much lower than that obtained for rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs. Notably, the transient photocurrent responses were highly reproducible as observed for all the studied electrodes over several on–off cycles of intermittent visible light illumination. These results indicated that the diffusion of the photogenerated electrons produces the photocurrent and the photoinduced holes are taken by ethanol as the acceptor. Accordingly, the photocurrent of the rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs electrode is approximately 9.4, 7.74 and 5.56 times higher than that of CdS NWs, rGO/CdS NWs and CdS NWs/Pt NPs electrodes, respectively. This significantly demonstrates the more efficient separation and longer lifetime of photoexcited electron–hole pairs of ternary hybrid rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs than each of the CdS NWs, rGO/CdS NWs and CdS NWs/Pt NPs modified electrodes.
 Fig. 11  (A) Photocurrent responses of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs electrode and CdS NWs (black line), rGO/CdS NWs (green line) and CdS NWs/Pt NPs (red line) electrodes under light irradiation in 3.0 M C2H5OH and 2.0 M KOH solution recorded at −0.32 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The illumination from a blue LED lamp was interrupted every 30 s. (B) Chronoamperometric curves of rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs electrode without blue LED light irradiation (red line) and with blue LED light irradiation in 3.0 M C2H5OH and 2.0 M KOH for 3500 s at −0.32 V vs. Ag/AgCl. 
Long-term stability is another important factor for a catalyst to be considered in various practical applications. To evaluate the stability of the proposed catalyst, chronoamperometric measurements were performed in 2.0 M KOH containing 3.0 M ethanol. Fig. 11B shows I–t plots for ethanol oxidation measured at a fixed potential of −0.32 V during 3500 s for the rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs modified electrode in the dark and under visible light irradiation. As illustrated, the maximum initial and steady-state oxidation current densities are evidently larger upon illumination, indicating that the catalytic activity and stability are improved and the photoassisted electrocatalytic process could remarkably enhance the oxidation efficiency toward ethanol oxidation.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a ternary rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs nanocomposite is successfully synthesized via a template-free route. The novel nanohybrid material combines the excellent electrocatalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles and the amazing photocatalytic features of 1D CdS NWs with the unique and attractive electronic behavior of rGO nanosheets. Through different microscopic and spectroscopic techniques employed for characterizing the morphology and characteristics of the nanohybrid, the successful modification of rGO with uniformly sized CdS NWs having diameters of 35 nm and decorated with Pt NPs has been demonstrated. CV and amperometry measurements indicated the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the ternary nanocomposite toward ethanol oxidation in alkaline medium and, interestingly, under visible light irradiation using a low-power blue LED lamp, the current density dramatically increased and the onset potential underwent a negative shift to −0.95 V due to the efficiently enhanced lifetime and faster interfacial charge transfer rate. In addition, over several on–off cycles of intermittent visible light illumination, transient photocurrent responses with good reproducibility were observed for rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs electrodes. Low onset potential, high If/Ib ratio, low percentage of Pt (1.96%) in the nanocomposite and low-power radiation source are the main advantages of the proposed composite. The ternary rGO/CdS NWs/Pt NPs may find promising potential applications in highly efficient and stable anodes for fuel cells and photoanodes in photoactivated fuel cells or other related fields.
