    , Accepted 19th June 2019First published on 19th June 2019AbstractThe coexistence of luminescent and magnetic properties in nanocomposites has attracted the interest of many researchers to study nanocomposites due to their unique properties. In this study, we present a convenient synthesis of Bi6Fe1.9Co0.1Ti3O18/SiO2/NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ (BFCTO/SiO2/NGF) core/shell/satellite nanocomposites with precise control over the thickness of the SiO2 shell. By adjusting the amount of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), we obtained BFCTO/SiO2/NGF samples with different SiO2 thicknesses (0 nm, 8 nm, 13 nm, 18 nm, 25 nm and 36 nm). On account of the SiO2 spacer effectively reducing the absorption intensity around the green and red regions, the optimal upconversion luminescence intensity of BFCTO/SiO2/NGF was observed at a separation distance of 36 nm. Moreover, at room temperature, the hysteresis loop of BFCTO/∼13 nm SiO2/NGF obtained the maximum remnant magnetization (2Mr) of 0.13 emu g−1. Also, the BFCTO/∼36 nm SiO2/NGF sample reached the maximum coercive field (2Hc) of 1200 Oe. Besides, the BFCTO/∼8 nm SiO2/NGF sample had the best ferromagnetism with a saturated magnetization Ms of 0.63 emu g−1.
1. Introduction
Nanocomposites are a hot topic in scientific research due to their unique properties and potential applications in various fields. At present, among these nanocomposites, the coexistence of luminescence and magnetic nanomaterials is of great interest, providing the possibility to realize the combination of the respective properties of each component or to achieve cooperatively enhanced performances. Therefore, these materials have been widely used in biological diagnoses and therapy, multifunctional devices, and solar cells.1–5
At present, there are two primary approaches to construct well-defined magnetic/luminescence nanocomposites. One method is the synthesis of a single-phase material simultaneously having dual-properties. On one hand, owing to the presence of a large number of unpaired 4f electrons in Gd3+, gadolinium-based compounds, such as Gd2O3, NaGdF4, GdPO4, and GdF3, have a paramagnetic property and are suitable for use as a luminescent matrix, which therefore make them very suitable for creating magnetic/luminescence nanocomposites.6–9 On the other hand, doped magnetic ions in luminescent matrices, such as Mn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ nanocrystals, exhibit magnetic and luminescent properties.10 Another more attractive and effective process is the synthesis of magnetic/luminescence heterogeneous or hybrid nanocomposites. As for the luminescent matrix selection, compared with quantum dots and organic molecules, upconversion materials have the following advantages: (a) a higher signal-to-noise ratio under near infrared irradiation; (b) high photostability and chemical stability; (c) low toxicity to the human body; and (d) good biocompatibility by surface modification and functionalization.11–17 Furthermore, as for the choice of magnetic materials, layer-structured bismuth-containing Aurivillius complex oxides, with a general formula Bin+1Fen−3Ti3O3n+3 (n denotes the number of perovskite layers), which are alternately stacked with fluorite-type (Bi2O2)2+ layers and perovskite-type (Bin−1Fen−3Ti3O3n+1)2− slabs, have attracted considerable attention due to their prominent multiferroic property and the potential photocatalytic activity of the single phase.18–23 In 2010, Shen et al. synthesized Fe3O4/NaYF4:Yb,Er heteronanoparticles by a novel ligand anchoring strategy. The heteronanoparticles showed good upconversion luminescence and superparamagnetism, which enabled both effective optical detection and magnetic trapping.24 In 2011, Xia et al. synthesized core–shell-structured NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+@FexOy nanocrystals. These materials showed a low photoluminescent quenching effect as a result of the FexOy coating.25 Xu et al. presented a facile method for the fabrication of NaYF4:Yb,Er/Tm@SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The obtained nanoparticles had very good superparamagnetic and luminescent properties.26 In 2012, Chen et al. designed and produced the γ-Fe2O3@SiO2@Gd2O3:Eu nanostructure. The results indicated that the iron oxide quenched luminescence. In order to increase the luminescence, they partially etched their oxide core in oxalic acid while preserving the radio luminescent shell.27 Zhang et al. fabricated Fe3O4@SiO2@α-NaYF4/Yb, Er nanorattles. This multifunctional mesoporous nanostructure with both upconversion luminescent and magnetic properties had an excellent high drug-loading capacity.28 Zhong et al. introduced a Fe3O4@NaGdF4:Yb/Er@NaGdF4:Yb/Er core/shell structure by using the seed-mediated growth method. Fe3O4 as the core endowed the nanoparticles with magnetic property, and the outer NaGdF4:Yb/Er shell improved the luminescent efficiency.29 In 2014, Liu et al. synthesized multifunctional NaYF4:Yb, Er@mSiO2@Fe3O4-PEG nanoparticles based on different sizes of upconversion nanoparticles. They found that increasing the size of the upconversion nanoparticles from 20 nm to 55 nm helped to increase the green emission intensity.30 In 2018, Hu et al. reported a NaLuF4:Yb3+/Er3+ optical-magnetic NaMnF3 bifunctional material by a facile hydrothermal method. These materials have some applications in the biosensing and bioimaging areas.31 Ge et al. prepared Bi6Fe1.9Co0.1Ti3O18/NaGdF4:Yb3+, Er3+ nanohybrids. The direct contact between Bi6Fe1.9Co0.1Ti3O18 and NaGdF4 nanoparticles resulted in luminescent quenching.20
Therefore, in this study, we designed an adjustable BFCTO/SiO2/NGF core/shell/satellite nanocomposite by a facile assembly method. By adjusting the amount of TEOS, we obtained BFCTO/SiO2/NGF samples with different SiO2 thicknesses. Under 980 nm laser excitation, when the spacer thickness of SiO2 reached 36 nm, the luminescent intensity achieved the maximum value. Moreover, at room temperature, by adjusting the thickness of SiO2, the hysteresis loop of BFCTO/∼13 nm SiO2/NGF obtained the maximum remnant magnetization. Besides, the BFCTO/∼36 nm SiO2/NGF sample reached the maximum coercive field. Moreover, the BFCTO/∼8 nm SiO2/NGF sample had the best ferromagnetism.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
All the chemicals, including Ti(OC4H9)4 (≥99.7%), Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (≥99%), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (≥98.5%), Co(NO3)3·6H2O (≥98.5%), HNO3 (65.0–68.0%), NaOH (≥96.0%), ethanol (99.7%), ammonia solution (25–28%), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, >99%), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES, >98%), Gd(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%), Yb(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%), Er(NO3)3·5H2O (99.99%), cis-oleic acid, NH4F (≥96.0%), cyclohexane, and HCl (36.0–38.0%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. without further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of BFCTO samples
The BFCTO nanoparticles were synthesized by the hydrothermal method according to our previous report.20
2.3 Synthesis of BFCTO/SiO2 samples
By a modified Stöber method, first, the as-prepared BFCTO nanoparticles were dispersed in a mixture of 30 mL deionized water and 120 mL ethanol by ultrasonication for 20 min, and then NH3·H2O (4 mL, 28 wt%) and a certain amount of TEOS were added. After stirring for 12 h, the BFCTO/SiO2 nanoparticles were obtained by centrifugation and by washing three times with deionized water and ethanol.
2.4 Synthesis of oleic acid-capped and oleic acid-free NGF samples
By the solvothermal method, we synthesized the oleic acid-capped NGF nanoparticles. Here, 3.12 mL Gd(NO3)3, 0.80 mL Yb(NO3)3, 0.08 mL Er(NO3)3, and 2 mL NH4F (2 M) were taken in a 50 mL beaker, and 10 mL ethanol, 10 mL oleic acid, and 3 mL NaOH solution (5 M) were added. After stirring for 30 min, the solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 200 °C for 3 h and then cooled to room temperature. The obtained nanoparticles were collected by centrifugation, followed by washing using cyclohexane and ethanol several times. Then, the oleic acid-capped NGF nanoparticles were dispersed in HCl solution (0.1 M) and ultrasonicated for 2 h to remove the ligands on the surface of the nanoparticles. Finally, by centrifugation, we obtained the oleic acid-free NGF nanoparticles. The products were further purified by washing them with ethanol and deionized water several times, and re-dispersed in deionized water.
2.5 Synthesis of the BFCTO/SiO2/NGF samples
The as-prepared BFCTO/SiO2 nanoparticles were added into the APTES solution (5 mL APTES in 100 mL ethanol), and stirred for 12 h at room temperature. After centrifugation and washing, the nanoparticles were dispersed in a 100 mL oleic acid-free NGF solution by stirring for 12 h. Then, the product was isolated by centrifugation and washed three times with deionized water and ethanol. The final product was obtained after drying under vacuum at 60 °C for 12 h.
2.6 Characterization
The phase structure and crystallinity of the samples were characterized by performing X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Philips X'Pert diffractometer employing Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å). The sizes and morphologies of the samples were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL, JSM-6700F). Low-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on a Tecnai G2 TF30 transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy line (EDX line) measurements were performed on a Tecnai G2 TF30 transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an ESCALAB 250 system with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (Thermo-VG Scientific). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectrometry (Thermo Scientific, Nicolet 8700) was performed to investigate the surface coating. To record the FT-IR absorption spectrum (400–4000 cm−1), a pellet was prepared by pressing a mixture of our powders and KBr. Ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-visible-NIR) diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu SolidSpec-3700 equipped with an integrating sphere, and BaSO4 was used as the reference. The upconversion emission spectra and decay curves were measured on an Edinburgh Instruments luminescence spectrometer (FLS980) under an external 980 nm laser excitation (LASEVER, LSR980-3W). The magnetic properties were characterized using the vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) option of the Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS) (Quantum Design, USA).
3. Results and discussion
Herein, we devised a simple synthetic protocol to successfully fabricate the unique BFCTO/SiO2/NGF nanocomposites, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. Initially, the BFCTO nanoparticles were synthesized by the hydrothermal reaction between Ti(OC4H9)4, Bi(NO3)3, Fe(NO3)3, Co(NO3)3, HNO3, and NaOH. Second, the obtained BFCTO nanoparticles were highly dispersed in ethanol/water solution, and then NH3·H2O and TEOS were added to obtain the BFCTO/SiO2 samples. Finally, the oleic acid-free NGF nanoparticles were added into the APTES-coated BFCTO/SiO2 solution, and then the BFCTO/SiO2/NGF nanocomposites were obtained as a result.

The crystal structures of the as-synthesized BFCTO, BFCTO/SiO2, BFCTO/SiO2/NGF, and NGF samples were investigated by XRD, as shown in Fig. 2. The results revealed that BFCTO was a single phase with no detectable secondary phases. Moreover, the samples could be indexed by an orthorhombic lattice (with the space group of B2cb, JCPDS Card No. 21-0101), which was consistent with the previous reported results in five-layered Aurivillius phases.32,33 Because of the amorphous nature of the SiO2 layer, there were no corresponding diffraction peaks in the BFCTO/SiO2 and BFCTO/SiO2/NGF samples.34 In the XRD patterns of BFCTO/SiO2/NGF, the sharp diffraction peaks indicated the high crystallinity of the nanocomposites. The diffraction characteristic peaks of NGF matched well with the hexagonal phase NGF (JCPDS Card No. 27-0699).35 Furthermore, all the diffraction peaks of the four samples revealed that no other impurity peaks were detected.

Fig. 3(a) and (b) display the SEM images of the BFCTO well-defined shape of the nanoplate. The thickness had an average size of 40 nm, with an edge length ranging from 100 nm to 0.5 μm. Fig. 3(c) shows the TEM image of the BFCTO sample. To investigate the structural information of this sample in detail, we have shown the HRTEM image in Fig. 3(d) taken from their corresponding images, indicated by the blue rectangle in Fig. 3(c). The HRTEM image in Fig. 3(d) recorded along the [001] zone axis of a nanoplate shows the lattice fringes with spacings of 0.273 nm, 0.274 nm and 0.383 nm, which can be attributed to the (200), (020), and (110) planes of the BFCTO orthorhombic phase, respectively. Also, the corresponding SAED pattern in the inset of Fig. 3(d) shows sharp diffraction spots, indicating the formation of a well-developed single-crystalline structure of BFCTO.

The distance between NGF nanoparticles and BFCTO nanoparticles could be adjusted by controlling the thickness of the spacer to achieve maximum luminescence enhancement. By adjusting the amount of TEOS, we obtained BFCTO/SiO2 samples with different SiO2 thicknesses, as shown in Fig. 4via a modified Stöber method. The thickness of SiO2 was 0 nm, which was also reported in a previous study.20 To further verify the successful synthesis of the BFCTO/SiO2/NGF nanocomposites, we show the TEM, HADDF-STEM images, and the corresponding linear EDX scanning spectra of the BFCTO/∼8 nm SiO2/NGF and BFCTO/∼25 nm SiO2/NGF nanocomposites, as represented in Fig. 5. The HRTEM of the selected NGF nanoparticles is shown in the inset of Fig. 5(a), and it indicates that the spacing between two adjacent lattice planes was 0.30 nm, fitting well with the (110) plane of the hexagonal phase NGF (PDF 27-0699). The HADDF-STEM images (Fig. 5(c) and (g)) display a sharp contrast between the BFCTO inside, SiO2 shell middle, and NGF nanoparticles outside, consistent with the TEM images in Fig. 5(b) and (f). The EDX line scan was conducted with HADDF-STEM imaging in Fig. 5(d) from inside to outside. The Si content at the particle edge was clearly higher than that in the interior. The Bi and Gd contents were enhanced in the center region of BFCTO/∼8 nm SiO2/NGF. Besides, another EDX line scan was conducted with the HADDF-STEM image in Fig. 5(h) from outside to the inside. A higher Si concentration was observed in the peripheral region of the crystal, while the enhanced Bi and Gd signals were distinguished inside of the BFCTO/∼25 nm SiO2/NGF nanocomposites. Therefore, these results gave direct evidence of the formation of a core/shell/satellite structure.

More detailed chemical and bonding environments of the resultant BFCTO/SiO2/NGF nanocomposites were further ascertained by the XPS analysis, as shown in Fig. 6. The binding energies obtained from the XPS analysis were corrected for specimen charging by referencing the C 1s line to 284.5 eV. The overview survey spectrum of the resulting BFCTO/SiO2/NGF and BFCTO samples revealed the concomitance of Bi, Fe, Co, Ti, O, Si, Na, Gd, F, and C elements in Fig. 6(a). The high-resolution spectrum of Bi 4f is shown in Fig. 6(b). The binding energies at 165.4 and 159.2 eV, correspond to the spin–orbit split Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2 peaks, respectively. The two peaks could be attributed to Bi2O3, implying that the Bi in this sample was in a +3 valence state.36 The core-level spectrum of Fe 2p is shown in Fig. 6(c). Two peaks located at 724.3 and 710.4 eV could be assigned to the binding energies of Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 peaks, respectively. The data were compared to those in Fe2O3, suggesting that Fe in this sample was in a +3 valence state.37 The peaks of Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2, which are located at 463.75 and 457.95 eV, respectively (Fig. 6(d)), correspond to the blinding energy in TiO2.38 The core-level spectrum of Co 2p is shown in Fig. 6(e). The peak at 782.6 eV corresponds to the binding energy of Co 2p3/2.39 For the SiO2 shell, the peak at 103.2 eV could be ascribed to the Si 2p, indicating that the chemical state of Si4+ was present in SiO2.40 Besides, the binding energies at 149.7 eV and 142.9 eV could be assigned to the binding energy of Gd 4d3/2 and Gd 4d5/2, respectively.41 All these indicated that we had successfully prepared the BFCTO/SiO2/NGF nanocomposite.

In order to further confirm the composition and surface structures of the products in each step, FT-IR spectroscopy was conducted for both the precursor and final products, as shown in Fig. 7. To enhance the water solubility of NGF nanoparticles and to avoid the upconversion luminescence quenching, we protonated the oleate ligand capped on the NGF nanoparticles using hydrochloric acid, resulting in the release of oleic acid from the surface. Therefore, the characteristic peaks of the oleate ligand did not appear in the oleic acid-free NGF FT-IR spectrum. In Fig. 7(a), the transmission bands at around 2925 and 2854 cm−1 ascribed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of methylene (CH2) in the alkyl chain of oleic acid disappeared. Besides, two bands at 1465 and 1556 cm−1 are absent, which are attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylic group of oleic acid, respectively. Furthermore, two bands at 3423 and 1632 cm−1 of oleic acid-free NGF were ascribed to the stretching and bending vibrations of O–H due to water molecules physically absorbed on the NGF nanoparticles surface, respectively. Therefore, the main composition of the oleic acid-free NGF would be water molecules.35,42 In addition, in Fig. 7(b), after the SiO2 coating, the transmission bands at around 1084 cm−1, 800 cm−1 and 481 cm−1 could be assigned to the Si–O stretching vibration, Si–O–Si bending vibration, and Si–O–Si rocking vibration, respectively, demonstrating the generation of a SiO2 shell from the hydrolysis reaction of TEOS.43 Compared with BFCTO/SiO2, the APTES-capped BFCTO/SiO2 sample had the stretching and bending vibrations of N–H groups at 3400 and 1616 cm−1, respectively.44 These results further confirmed that APTES ligands had been successfully grafted onto the surface of the SiO2 shell.

The upconversion luminescence was measured using illumination by a 980 nm continuous wave diode laser with a power of 800 mW. Fig. 8(a) shows the emission spectra of NGF and all the BFCTO/SiO2/NGF samples. Under the 980 nm laser excitation, green emission centered at 541 nm and red emissions centered at 655 nm were observed, originating from the transitions 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 of Er3+ ions, respectively. Obviously, compared with NGF nanoparticles, the luminescence of all the BFCTO/SiO2/NGF samples was quenched. Besides, the lifetimes of the 4S3/2 and 4F9/2 states of Er3+ ions for the NGF nanoparticles had much longer lifetimes relative to the BFCTO/SiO2/NGF samples (Table 1). However, in allusion to the BFCTO/SiO2/NGF magnetic/luminescence nanocomposites, to suppress the quenching effect, the SiO2 thickness must be restricted to a certain threshold. Notably, when the spacer thickness of SiO2 reached 36 nm, the enhancement intensity of the green and red emissions reached its maximum values (Fig. 8(b)). In contrast, the direct contact between the NGF and BFCTO nanoparticles had the weakest luminescent intensity. Meanwhile, we show the upconversion luminescence enhancement factors for both green and red emission bands as a function of the silica spacer thickness in Fig. 9(c). Here, we define the enhancement factor as I/I0, where I and I0 are the fluorescence intensities of BFCTO/SiO2/NGF with and without the SiO2 shell, respectively. Maximum green and red enhancement factors of about 1.78 and 1.67 were achieved with a spacer thickness of 36 nm, respectively. Moreover, to identify the suppression in the quenching effect related to the SiO2 thickness in the BFCTO/SiO2/NGF nanocomposites, we compared the lifetimes of all the samples. As shown in Fig. 8(c) and (d) and Table 1, significant increase in Er3+ lifetimes (4S3/2, 4F9/2) were observed when the spacer thickness of SiO2 reached 36 nm relative to 0 nm. Taken together, these data suggest that the SiO2 spacer can suppress the quenching effect in BFCTO/SiO2/NGF nanocomposites.

The enhancement factors were extracted from the emission spectra shown in Fig. 8(b). 
To verify the luminescent quenching, we further investigated the UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra in the wavelength range of 300–1000 nm for the products with different SiO2 thicknesses (Fig. 9(a)). After the normalization process, all the BFCTO/SiO2/NGF products had a broad absorbance in the visible-light range because of Fe and Co ion doping. The absorption could be attributed to the O-2p to Co-3d, Fe-3d to Ti-3d, and Fe-3d to Co-3d transitions.45 Remarkably, with the SiO2 thickness increasing, the absorption intensity around the visible region weakened (Fig. 9(b)). This phenomenon could be ascribed to the light-scattering effect on both emission and incident light by the silica layer.46 On the contrary, the upconversion luminescent intensity for green and red emission bands were enhanced. Therefore, the SiO2 spacer between NGF and BFCTO nanoparticles could effectively ease the luminescence quenching.
To investigate the number of photons involved in the upconversion process of the samples, the pumping power dependence of the upconversion luminescence intensity of the BFCTO/NGF and BFCTO/∼36 nm SiO2/NGF samples were investigated. The intensities of green and red emission are displayed as a function of the 980 nm excitation power in Fig. 10(a) and (c), respectively. The relative luminescence intensity gradually increased on enhancing the excitation power. For an unsaturated upconversion process, the number of photons (n) that are required to populate the upper emitting state can be described by the following relation: I (upconversion emission intensity) ∝ P (the infrared excitation power)n. For the BFCTO/NGF nanoparticle, we can see that the value of n is 1.50 and 1.71 for the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 emissions, respectively. Besides, for the BFCTO/∼36 nm SiO2/NGF nanoparticles, we can see that the value of n is 1.69 and 1.86 for the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 emissions, respectively, (Fig. 10(b) and (d)). This means that the green and red emissions are both two-photon processes.

The possible upconversion luminescence mechanism diagram of BFCTO/SiO2/NGF is presented in Fig. 11. The emission peak splitting could be ascribed to the energy transfer in the upconversion process. Studies of the power dependence of upconversion revealed that the green and red emitting states are populated via a two-photon process, respectively. Therefore, with the excitation of the 980 nm laser, the 4F7/2 level in Er3+ is populated via an two-photon process by an efficient energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ ions. Then, this energy can decay nonradiatively to the 2H11/2, 4S3/2, and 4F9/2 levels, then green 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 (525 nm), 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 (545 nm), and red emission of 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 (660 nm) occur. Notably, the emissions of the NGF nanoparticles overlapped with the absorption band of BFCTO/SiO2/NGF in the visible spectral regions, thereby enabling Förster resonance energy transfer. This energy transfer could be confirmed by the observation of the emission quenching of the BFCTO/SiO2/NGF under 980 nm excitation.

Moreover, to study the magnetic behavior of the BFCTO/SiO2/NGF samples with different SiO2 thicknesses, we observed the room temperature M–H hysteresis loops in Fig. 12. In Fig. 12(a), for the BFCTO sample, it can be seen that the sample has spontaneous magnetic moments, indicating its ferromagnetic nature. The existence of the ferromagnetic property was attributed to the spin canting of the Fe- and Co-based sublattices via Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction due to the octahedral titling between the adjacent CoO6 and FeO6 octahedral.47–49 Besides, the M–H plot of the NGF nanoparticles exhibited a linear behavior, implying the characteristic of a paramagnetic property (Fig. 12(b)). In Fig. 12(c), the M–H plots of the as-prepared BFCTO/SiO2/NGF samples still retained a ferromagnetic property. Meanwhile, the magnetization values were slightly increased compared with BFCTO. Obviously, the hysteresis loop of BFCTO/∼13 nm SiO2/NGF obtained the maximum remnant magnetization (2Mr) of 0.13 emu g−1. Also, the BFCTO/∼36 nm SiO2/NGF sample reached the maximum coercive field (2Hc) of 1200 Oe. Moreover, the BFCTO/∼8 nm SiO2/NGF sample had the best ferromagnetism with a saturated magnetization (Ms) of 0.63 emu g−1 (Fig. 12(d)).

4. Conclusion
In summary, we successfully synthesized BFCTO/SiO2/NGF core/shell/satellite nanocomposites with precise control over the thickness of the SiO2 shell. On account of the SiO2 spacer effective reducing the absorption intensity around the green and red regions, the optimal upconversion luminescence intensity of BFCTO/SiO2/NGF was observed at a separation distance of 36 nm. Moreover, at room temperature, by adjusting the thickness of SiO2, the hysteresis loop of the BFCTO/∼13 nm SiO2/NGF and BFCTO/∼36 nm SiO2/NGF samples obtained the maximum remnant magnetization and the maximum coercive field, respectively. Meanwhile, the BFCTO/∼8 nm SiO2/NGF sample had the best ferromagnetism. It is expected that the unique properties and functions offered by this nanocomposites will enable its wide implementation in biological imaging, photoactivity, and reliable magnetic recyclability.
