    , Accepted 26th March 2019First published on 26th March 2019AbstractWater shortage and pollution are recognized as one of the most pressing global challenges. Solar power-based water treatment combining photodegradation with photothermal evaporation has showed particular promise. However, the moderate photothermal and photocatalytic capability of the reported materials for combined water treatment has largely restrained the treatment efficiency. Herein, instead of integrating two functional components, we develop SnSe nanoparticles into a novel photothermal–photocatalytic dual-functional core–shell composite by one-step simple surface oxidation. The resultant SnSe@SnO2 demonstrates excellent properties for synchronous pollutant degradation and water evaporation upon solar irradiation of one sun (0.1 W cm−2). A water evaporation rate of ∼1.19 kg m−2 h−1 with a methyl orange degradation rate of ∼0.093 min−1 are achieved. This work provides a convenient and novel strategy to fabricate dual-functional composites from a single component for energy conversion, catalysis, and photothermal applications.

Environmental significance
Shortage of clean water has been one of the most urgent global issues. Despite the vast success in producing clean water, the cost, efficiency, by-products, and energy consumption of the developed methods remain as concerns. Incorporating photodegradation with photothermal evaporation has been recognized as a promising, novel strategy for water treatment, whilst the relevant results have been rather scarce and the reported treatment efficiency was moderate. Herein, instead of integrating two components, SnSe nanoparticles have been developed into a core–shell nanocomposite by one-step simple surface oxidation, showing competent photothermal–photocatalytic dual functions for synchronous pollutant degradation and water evaporation upon solar irradiation of one sun.

1. Introduction
From economically underdeveloped rural areas to modern metropolises, shortage of clean water has been one of the most challenging and urgent global issues.1–4 In addition to climate and environmental reasons, the main cause for this crisis in modern society is water pollution from various organic contamination, water-borne pathogens, heavy metals, etc., primarily due to the excessive emissions of industrial wastewater, sewage, pesticides and fertilizers.5–7 Vast success has been achieved in producing clean water in the last century by using versatile decontamination methods, e.g. boiling and distillation, multi-step adsorption and filtration, and addition of purifiers, reactants and other additives.8,9 However, besides the worries about by-products and low efficiency, the cost and/or energy consumption of these developed methods remain as concerns.10,11 Solar power-based water cleaning has thus become particularly fascinating and prevailing in recent years.12–14
Photothermal materials (PTM), which harvest photon energies to generate heat, have attracted enormous and broad attention, due to their remarkable potential for novel antitumor therapies15–19 and photothermal water treatments.20,21 Instead of focusing within the narrow range of near-infrared (NIR) light hence requiring high energy consumption, photothermal water treatments utilizing the full solar spectrum have recently demonstrated considerable potential, mainly for water sterilization21 and evaporation.20,22 However, the former only aims at single or all kinds of bacteria, and does not deal with organic pollutants and other contaminants in water; the latter is questionable due to the risk of secondary water pollution by released organic pollutants during the heating process, although it essentially excludes the worries about bacteria and heavy metals. In this regard, incorporating photodegradation with photothermal evaporation would be ideal to solve this issue. Surprisingly, the application of such combined water treatment has been studied very scarcely. Still, the moderate photothermal and photocatalytic capability of the reported materials (TiO2–PDA/PPy, Au@TiO2, Au–ZnO)23–25 upon solar irradiation limited the efficiency of the water treatment.
As a matter of fact, photothermal effect-promoted photocatalysis has become quite popular very recently.26,27 Paradoxically, in addition to the common requirement, i.e. strong optical absorption for the entire solar spectrum, efficient photothermal conversion relies on electron–hole recombination, whilst photocatalysis prefers electron–hole separation.28–30 Therefore, a single component material simultaneously possessing the two capabilities normally fails to afford high performance on either of the applications. To solve this conflict, a successful and widely-applied strategy is integrating catalysts with photothermal materials, e.g. Fe@γ–Fe2O3@H–TiO2, and MoO3−x–Ag.31,32 However, the fabrication of such composites from separate functional components is normally sophisticated and difficult, requiring multi-step reaction, purification, coating and post-treatment.
As one of IV–VI compounds, SnSe is a typical semiconductor widely applied in thermoelectric devices, solar cells, and energy storage.33,34 Besides its broad optical absorption covering 89% of the solar spectrum35 and high optical absorption coefficient,36 the significant photothermal effect of SnSe has been revealed lately.37
SnO2 is a known n-type semiconductor (bandgap of 3.6–4.0 eV) with a broad application horizon in gas sensors,38 dye solar cells,39 optoelectronic devices,40 field effect transistors,41 transparent conductive oxides,42etc. Very recently, SnO2 and its composites have received increasing level of interest for various photocatalytic reactions.43–45
In this work, instead of integrating two components, we have developed SnSe nanoparticles (NPs) into a photothermal–photocatalytic dual-functional composite by one-step simple surface oxidation, and applied the resultant core–shell SnSe@SnO2 NPs in synchronous pollutant degradation and water evaporation upon solar irradiation of one sun (Scheme 1). Our design of the core–shell SnSe@SnO2 structure aims at optimizing the functions of SnO2 and SnSe, where the exposed SnO2 shell maintains the active sites of this catalyst, meanwhile the thinness of this shell (<5 nm) reduces the influence of the cover layer on the photothermal properties of the SnSe core. Encouragingly, SnSe@SnO2 exhibits excellent photocatalytic and photothermal properties for water treatment utilizing solar energy. A water evaporation rate of ∼1.19 kg m−2 h−1 is achieved along with a reaction rate of 0.093 min−1 for degradation of methyl orange (MO) under one sun irradiation. The evaporation rate is one of the highest values for inorganic semiconducting PTMs,37,46–49 superior to the reported SnSe NPs (0.85 kg m−2 h−1), thanks to the distinct nanostructure and the enhanced optical absorption of SnSe@SnO2. Moreover, benefiting from the electron transfer, temperature increment and boosted optical absorption in the presence of the SnSe core, the photocatalytic performance of SnSe@SnO2 is also significantly improved compared with that of pure SnO2. This work has thus provided a facile and convenient strategy to fabricate dual-functional composites from a single component for energy conversion, catalysis, and photothermal applications.

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The chemicals used in this study were selenium powder (≥99.999% metals basis, D50: 80 mesh, Aladdin), sodium borohydride (98%, Aladdin), sodium hydroxide (AR, Aladdin), SnCl2·2H2O (98%, Aladdin), P25 (TiO2, AR, Aladdin), MO (Ind, Aladdin), and N-methyl pyrrolidone (98%, Aladdin). Poly(vinylidene fluoride) was purchased from Tianjin Aiweixin Chemical Technology Company Limited. Nylon film was purchased from Shanghai Xinya Purification Equipment Company. Unless otherwise stated, all the chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and used as received. Deionized (DI) water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm was from a Milli-Q water purification system.
2.2. Synthesis of the SnSe and SnSe@SnO2 nanoparticles
NaOH (100 mmol) and SnCl2·2H2O (10 mmol) were added into DI water (50 mL) in a three-neck round-bottom flask to obtain a transparent Na2SnO2 solution. In parallel, Se (10 mmol) and NaBH4 (20 mmol) were dissolved in DI water (50 mL) in a single-neck round-bottom flask and the NaHSe solution was obtained. After the Na2SnO2 solution was heated to 140 °C, the NaHSe aqueous solution was mixed with the solution. After maintaining at 140 °C in an argon atmosphere for 2 h, the SnSe product was collected by centrifugation, washed with DI water and ethanol, and dried at 50 °C for 12 h. To produce SnSe@SnO2, the SnSe mixture solution was kept at 140 °C, exposed to air for 1 h, and then cooled to room temperature, followed by centrifugation, washing with DI water and ethanol, and drying at 50 °C for 12 h.
2.3. Characterization
The samples were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Advance D8 Discover, Bruker, using a Cu Kα source), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB-250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific, with an Al Kα source), and ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (UV-vis-NIR, U-4100, Hitachi and Evolution 300, Thermo Scientific). A xenon lamp (300 W, LSXS-300, Beijing Zhuoli Hanguang Instrument Co., Ltd.) with an AM 1.5 filter was used to simulate the solar irradiation.
2.4. Photocurrent measurement
SnSe and SnSe@SnO2 were dispersed ultrasonically in DI water, respectively. The obtained paste (2 mg mL−1, 50 μL) was placed on the conducting ITO substrate (2.0 cm × 1.0 cm) and dried in air as a working electrode. Photocurrent measurements were carried out using a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation upon simulated solar irradiation, and a homemade three-electrode system that consisted of the working electrode, a platinum-coil counter-electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in a Na2SO4 (0.1 mol L−1, 30 mL) electrolyte solution.
2.5. Photocatalytic degradation
To evaluate the photocatalytic capability of SnSe@SnO2 in water, MO was used as a model organic pollutant. Briefly, SnSe@SnO2 powder (50 mg) was added to the MO aqueous solution (10 mg L−1, 50 mL) and stirred for 30 min in the dark to achieve adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the dye and the catalyst. The irradiation power density was 0.1 W cm−2. Optical absorption spectra were used to monitor the variation of MO concentration during the reaction.
2.6. Fabrication of the SnSe-based film and SnSe@SnO2-based film
SnSe or SnSe@SnO2 (20 mg) was dispersed in N-methyl pyrrolidone (20 mL) with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (2 mg) in an ultrasonic bath. The mixture was deposited on a nylon film (NF) under vacuum conditions. After that, the film was dried at 50 °C for 10 h, and cut into a circular film of 4.0 cm in diameter.
2.7. Solar water evaporation
The SnSe@SnO2 film was floated on water in a glass beaker. The samples were irradiated by a solar simulator of 0.1 W cm−2. The weight loss and surface temperature were recorded using an electronic mass balance with an accuracy of 0.1 mg and an infrared camera, respectively. NF and the SnSe-based film were measured as the control groups.
2.8. Photothermal water evaporation efficiency (η) calculation
Photothermal water evaporation efficiency (η) was calculated based on the following equation:η = ν·He/Qinwhere ν is the evaporation rate of water; He is the heat of evaporation of water (2266 kJ kg−1); Qin is the incident simulated solar light power (0.1 W cm−2).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis and characterization
As illustrated in Scheme 1, the SnSe@SnO2 nanocomposite was produced from the SnSe NPs by surface oxidization in air, forming a core–shell structure with the inherent SnSe as the core encapsulated by the SnO2 shell. As seen in the typical TEM image (Fig. 1A), the pristine SnSe NPs were of a size of 30–90 nm, with sharp and smooth edges. The HR-TEM image of a single SnSe NP (inset of Fig. 1B) reveals a lattice spacing of 0.29 nm, corresponding to the (011) planes of the SnSe crystal. After being oxidized in air, the particle borders became evidently rougher and blurry (Fig. 1C). The HR-TEM image (inset of Fig. 1D) indicates that the lattice spacing of the particle core was preserved at 0.29 nm, whilst the shell (thickness <5 nm) showed lower contrast without noticeable crystallization. The thickness of the SnO2 shell can be tuned in a controllable manner by oxidation.

Consistently, XRD analysis of SnSe@SnO2 (Fig. 2A) showed a nearly identical pattern to that of the SnSe NPs, showing only peaks well-indexed to the orthorhombic structure of SnSe (JCPDS 48-1224) and in the absence of any diffraction peaks corresponding to SnO2. The results suggest the amorphous structure and low content (i.e. small thickness) of the SnO2 shell.

XPS was employed to explore the elemental composition of SnSe@SnO2 further. As shown in Fig. 2B, the XP peaks corresponding to Se, Sn, and O can be evidently observed in the survey spectrum. The existence of C was attributed to the substrate for the XPS sample preparation. The chemical states of Sn were further assessed by the high-resolution XP spectrum of Sn 3d (Fig. 2C). Both the Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks were found to split into two components, respectively, where the peaks centered at 495.0 eV and 486.6 eV are ascribed to Sn–O bonding, and those at 493.5 eV and 485.1 eV are attributed to Sn–Se.50 The XPS results further confirm the presence of SnO2 with SnSe.
The optical absorption and band structure of SnSe@SnO2 were examined. As shown in the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum (Fig. 2D), the SnSe@SnO2 powder exhibited strong and broad band optical absorption covering the entire tested spectrum, nearly identical to the SnSe NPs. Such potent solar-light harvesting capability is highly preferred by both photothermal conversion and photocatalysis. Based on the curves of (αhν)1/2vs. (hν) (the inset of Fig. 2D) derived from the absorption spectrum, the direct bandgap of SnSe@SnO2 was calculated to be ∼1.2 eV, which barely varied compared with SnSe, also suggesting the small thickness of the SnO2 shell.
The electron–hole separation efficiency of SnSe@SnO2 was then studied by photocurrent measurements (Fig. S1†), using SnSe as the control group. Both samples showed a quick response to the solar light irradiation of one sun, whilst the photocurrent generated by SnSe@SnO2 was nearly two-fold that of SnSe, indicating a much more efficient electron–hole pair separation of SnSe@SnO2. This enhanced response of SnSe@SnO2 is beneficial for the production of reactive oxygen in photodegradation.
After being exposed to air at room temperature for one week, no macroscopic aggregates were observed from the SnSe@SnO2 dispersion. Moreover, the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum of such dispersion after one week of storage was also nearly identical to that of the fresh dispersion (Fig. S2†). Both these experimental observations indicate the long-term stability of SnSe@SnO2. In addition, the strong and broad band absorption from 300 to 900 nm of the dispersion further confirmed the powerful solar light-harvesting capability of SnSe@SnO2.
3.2. Solar water evaporation
Encouraged by the solar-light harvesting capability, the photothermal conversion performance of the SnSe@SnO2-based film was investigated under one sun illumination of solar light. As shown in Fig. 3A, the film provided immediate and remarkable temperature response upon the solar light irradiation, with the temperature increased to above 65 °C within 5 s, and quickly reached an equilibrium temperature of ∼90 °C within 7 min. Although the temperature increment of SnSe@SnO2 was lower than that of SnSe in the first 400 s due to the lower photothermal capability of SnO2, SnSe@SnO2 achieved a nearly identical equilibrium temperature upon extended irradiation due to the thin thickness of SnO2 and the final balanced thermal transfer under ambient conditions. The photothermal effect of SnSe@SnO2 is more significant than many recently reported photothermal materials for water evaporation upon one sun irradiation, e.g. Ti2O3 nanoparticles (∼52 °C by 700 s of irradiation)51 and hierarchically-nanostructured gel (∼45 °C by 500 s of irradiation).52

(D) Photothermal cycling stability of the SnSe@SnO2-based and SnSe-based films. 
The water evaporation rate of the SnSe@SnO2-based film was then explored under one sun irradiation (Fig. 3B). While a slow evaporation rate of ∼0.61 kg m−2 h−1 was obtained from the control group (i.e. NF), an evaporation rate as high as 1.19 kg m−2 h−1 was achieved from the SnSe@SnO2-based film. The rate is higher than that of many photothermal water evaporation materials reported previously,37,46–49e.g. 0.80 kg m−2 h−1 for TiOx.47
The solar-to-water conversion efficiency (η) was calculated based on the water evaporation under 3 h of irradiation (Fig. 3C). The η of SnSe@SnO2-based films was ∼75.3%, which is much higher than that of the reported photothermal–photocatalytic Au@TiO2 film (46.3% under as high as five sun irradiation).23,24 The cycle stability of the SnSe@SnO2-based film was further investigated (Fig. 3D). Upon 10 repeated photothermal cycles with over 3 h of irradiation for each cycle, the photothermal conversion efficiency of SnSe@SnO2 was maintained above 95%. Both the high photothermal conversion capability and cycling stability are highly desirable in the practical application for water treatment.
3.3. Photocatalytic performance of SnSe@SnO2
The photocatalytic activity of the SnSe@SnO2 nanocomposite was evaluated by MO degradation under irradiation of solar light, with the performance of P25 (TiO2 NPs, a widely-used commercial photocatalyst), SnO2 and SnSe NPs as the control groups. Given the low sample concentration applied for MO degradation, optical absorption of the MO solution in the presence of SnSe@SnO2, SnSe, and SnO2 showed no significant variation compared with the pure MO solution (Fig. S3†), whilst a small decrease was induced by P25. By monitoring the optical absorbance of MO in the presence of these catalysts upon irradiation (Fig. S4–S7†), the photocatalytic degradation with time was plotted as shown in Fig. 4A. Complete degradation of MO was achieved by SnSe@SnO2 within 40 min. In contrast, the pristine SnSe NPs did not exhibit any noticeable photocatalytic effect. Remarkably, SnSe@SnO2 afforded much higher degradation capability than SnO2 and P25 under the same irradiation. As revealed by the degradation kinetics shown in Fig. 4B, the reaction rate constant (k) of SnSe@SnO2 was calculated to be 0.0934 min−1, which is ∼216% that of P25 (0.0432 min−1) and ∼23-fold that of SnO2 (0.00403 min−1), demonstrating the high photocatalytic capability of SnSe@SnO2 utilizing solar light. Such superior performance of SnSe@SnO2 is closely related to its largely-enhanced optical absorption and temperature increment upon solar-light irradiation, as SnO2 only harvests UV light and has no photothermal effect.

3.4. Photodegradation and photothermal water evaporation by the SnSe@SnO2-based film
Although the SnSe@SnO2 NPs showed competent photocatalytic degradation capability when uniformly dispersed in the MO solution, their photocatalytic feasibility and efficacy remain as certain concerns when they are used for water evaporation, given that (1) the SnSe@SnO2-based film was floated on the aqueous solution surface instead of being immersed in the liquid so that the interface of the catalyst with the MO solution, hence effective catalyst surface area for the reaction, was largely reduced, and (2) with efficient water evaporation, the MO concentration would be increased although the catalyst indeed functioned. With these questions, we then explored the photocatalytic effect of the SnSe@SnO2-based film floating on the MO solution upon solar irradiation of one sun. Encouragingly, despite the unfavorable setting, the SnSe@SnO2-based film delivered pronounced photocatalytic performance, together with synchronous water evaporation of 1.19 kg m−2 h−1. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, the initial MO solution was deep yellow, and the color became more and more pale gradually with extended irradiation until colorless purified water was achieved from the remaining solution in the beaker. Moreover, we also double checked the condensed evaporated water (Fig. 5C and S8†), which showed no contamination from MO. These results further emphasize the great promise of the SnSe@SnO2-based film for contaminated water treatment and clean water production by solar energy.

(B) Digital photos of the MO solution taken from the solution in the beaker at different time points, showing that the SnSe@SnO2-based film can effectively degrade MO under extended solar irradiation. (C) Digital photo of the evaporated water from the condensed MO solution. 
3.5. Photothermal–photocatalytic mechanism
With the absorbing photon energies greater than or equal to the band gap of a semiconductor, the electrons (e−) in their valence band (VB) will be excited to the conduction band (CB), leaving the same number of holes (h+) in the VB.53 For photocatalysts, these photogenerated charges (both e− and h+) will then migrate to the particle surface and participate in the catalytic reactions with surrounding chemicals; whilst for photothermal materials, the excited e− will shift back to the VB and recombine with h+, releasing heat.54 In the present case, SnO2 and SnSe followed these two distinct routes, respectively, contributing to the photocatalytic degradation and photothermal water evaporation synchronously (Scheme 1). Moreover, as the VB of SnSe is lower than that of SnO2,55 at the SnSe and SnO2 interfaces, the e− of SnSe can migrate from their CB to the CB of SnO2 and further boost the photocatalytic properties of SnO2. Both e− migrated from SnSe and those e− and h+ generated by SnO2 contributed to the degradation, facilitating the conversion of contaminants into nontoxic small molecules.54 Meanwhile, the inner SnSe follows the electron–hole recombination manner and generates heat efficiently.
4. Conclusions
A dual-functional core–shell SnSe@SnO2 nanocomposite has been developed from pristine SnSe NPs by one-step simple surface oxidation. This rationally designed form has improved the photothermal–photocatalytic properties of SnSe@SnO2: (1) the outer SnO2 shell as the catalyst maintains its active sites for reaction; (2) the small thinness of this shell (<5 nm) reduces the influence of the cover layer on the photothermal properties of the SnSe core; (3) photogenerated electrons of SnSe at the SnSe/SnO2 interfaces can migrate to SnO2 that enhance the photocatalytic performance; (4) the broad band and strong optical absorption of SnSe also improve the solar-light photocatalysis of SnO2. The SnSe@SnO2 shows competent capability on both photothermal water evaporation and photocatalytic degradation under solar irradiation of one sun. A water evaporation rate of ∼1.19 kg m−2 and solar-to-water conversion efficiency of ∼75.3% are demonstrated. Moreover, a MO degradation rate of 0.0934 min−1 is achieved, which is more than two-fold the reaction rate of widely-used P25 and 23-fold that of SnO2. The results represent the best performance for photothermal–photocatalytic water treatment ever reported. We hope this fresh strategy, i.e. achieving photothermal–photocatalytic composites by one-step surface oxidation of photothermal materials, will inspire more novel ideas for development of powerful and versatile composites applied in solar energy conversion and utilization applications.

Environmental significance
Shortage of clean water has been one of the most urgent global issues. Despite the vast success in producing clean water, the cost, efficiency, by-products, and energy consumption of the developed methods remain as concerns. Incorporating photodegradation with photothermal evaporation has been recognized as a promising, novel strategy for water treatment, whilst the relevant results have been rather scarce and the reported treatment efficiency was moderate. Herein, instead of integrating two components, SnSe nanoparticles have been developed into a core–shell nanocomposite by one-step simple surface oxidation, showing competent photothermal–photocatalytic dual functions for synchronous pollutant degradation and water evaporation upon solar irradiation of one sun.
