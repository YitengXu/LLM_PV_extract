    , Accepted 27th July 2018First published on 31st July 2018AbstractCatalyst design and surface chemistry have long been regarded as the major foundations for the catalytic activity of carbon-based catalysts. However, surface modification of carbon-based catalysts typically involves huge quantities of strong acids that eventually leach into the solution contaminating the target compounds. We have previously demonstrated that the mixture of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and residual cellulose would generate additional glucose after the first cycle by simply elevating the temperature. In this study, we sought to understand how rGO under microwave (MW)-subcritical water (subH2O) facilitates the depolymerization of cellulose. It was found out that the MW sensitizing properties of rGO improved, enhancing the electronic transport properties. The partial removal of functional groups has resulted into much smaller particles and formation of nanopores and nanovoids which facilitated the precise cleaving of the glycosidic bonds with glucose yields reaching up to 66 ± 4 wt% in as short as 5 min. The yield highly correlates with the H3O+/OH− concentration and hugely depends on the rGO structure that varies according to the synthesis method, preferably in the absence of water. The depolymerization mechanism takes place via random scission. This study indicates that rGO, in spite of having fewer functionalities than pristine graphene oxide (GO), can still be used for catalysis even without surface modification in combination with MW and subH2O.
1. Introduction
Solid acid catalysts have been extensively studied to enable efficient pathways for biomass conversion into biofuels and oxychemicals.1,2 One of the most intensively studied method is the hydrolysis of cellulose into fermentable sugars such as glucose, typically achieved through strong homogeneous acids and more recently, through heterogeneous acid catalysis. Particular interest has been devoted to carbon-based heterogeneous catalysts as metal-free and sustainable catalytic materials for cellulose depolymerization.3 Cheaper biomass feedstock categorized as second-generation biomass would enable a cost competitive process, with additional cost cuts from cheaper carbon-based catalysts than their metal-based counterparts.4 The catalytic activity of carbon-based catalysts is governed by their design and surface chemistry, especially by the presence of Brønsted-acid sites that play a huge role in the hydrolysis reaction. Rinaldi and Schüth had also discussed the importance of catalyst composition, active sites, water resistance and porosity for the design of solid catalysts.5 Since acid density highly correlates to the catalytic activity,7,8 various techniques on surface modification have been carried out in order to increase the density of acid sites on the carbon backbone. Typical examples include sulfonation with sulfuric acids9 and functionalization with halides or carboxylic acids.10,11 Unfortunately, surface modification requires a significant quantity of acids for preparation, and yet, catalyst reusability is limited. For instance, since the sulfo group leaches out, contaminating the target products.12 It should also be noted that reactions involving water catalysed by solid acid is a grand challenge for heterogeneous catalysis since it induces significant structural changes in the catalyst. Hence, at some point, a trade-off between stability and activity must be enforced.
Amongst carbon-based catalysts, graphene oxide (GO) has attracted significant attention due to the variety of oxygenated functionalities in its surface while bearing the myriad of physical, chemical and electrical properties of graphene. We have previously demonstrated that the oxygenated functionalities on the GO surface, despite being weakly acidic, can synergistically disrupt the extensive hydrogen bonding network protecting the β-glycosidic bond for hydrolytic cleaving.6 However, GO sheds off some surface functionalities under hydrothermal conditions, resembling reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which resulted to a slow-down in the decrystallization of the cellulose surface and it cannot fully hydrolyze cellulose with the same activity as fresh GO.
A major interest arising then is how carbon based catalysts without further functionalization with strong acids, could facilitate cellulose depolymerization. In the case of rGO, the reduced quantity of surface functionalities boosted its hydrophobicity, limiting its interaction with water and soluble compounds thus affecting the efficiency of the depolymerization process. Instead of increasing the reactivity of cellulose that would require an additional solvent or additive, we propose that the reactivity of water be amplified by increasing operating temperatures i.e. at subcritical conditions under MW irradiation. The large ion product in the system creates H3O+ and OH− in high concentrations, thus would increase the acidity of the bulk solution,13 and ease the insertion of water into the β-glycosidic bond that leads to hydrolysis and glucose formation. In addition, rGO as a MW sensitizer would compensate for the drop in the dielectric constant of water.
Herein, we sought to understand the structure–property–activity correlation of rGO in synergy with MW-subH2O. Individually, rGO, MW and subH2O have limitations but their integration in a single system brings about a route that has never been previously considered before. Controlled experiments using conventional heating and other carbon-based catalysts such as graphite and MWCNTs were performed to understand the process. Furthermore, the individual contribution of rGO, MW and subH2O to the integrated system was elucidated. A proposed mechanism that best explains the process was also deduced.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Graphite powder, sulfuric acid (98%), sodium nitrate, potassium permanganate and hydrogen peroxide (30%) for the GO synthesis and glucose and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural standard reagents were all supplied by Wako Pure Chemicals Industries (Osaka, Japan). Avicel microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) as the model compound was procured from Merck USA. All chemicals were utilized as received.
2.2 GO/rGO synthesis
GO was synthesized following a modified Hummer's method that was described in full detail in a previous publication.6 The reduced GO (rGO) used in this study was prepared as follows: (1) MW-hydrothermal reduction denoted as rGO1: briefly, the synthesized GO powder was subjected to MW irradiation-induced reduction using a CEM Microwave Assisted Reactor system (MARS 6, CEM Matthews NC Company, USA) and an XP1500 reactor (inner volume = 100 ml). In this process, 1 part GO to 5 parts water were placed in the XP1500 reactor, mounted onto the holder and subjected to 200 W, at 473 K for 60 min. After cooling down, the powder was filtered and dried at 293 K for 48 h. (2) Thermally annealed GO denoted as rGO2 was prepared following the method stated by Voiry et al.14 wherein GO powder was heated in a tubular electric furnace under argon gas for 1 h at 573 K.
2.3 Catalyst characterization
Freely settled bulk density measurements were performed using a container with a known capacity. The container was filled with the powders and was levelled off. The container was weighed and the bulk density was calculated according to eqn (1); bulk density (dry, kg m−3), M: mass of the material in the container (fresh, kg), and V: volume of the empty container (m3). Bulk density = MV(1)
A JEOL JSM-7600F field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) was used to analyze the surface morphology of the samples. Images were taken at ×100 and ×5000 magnifications at a 2 kV filament voltage. The rGO1 samples were sputter coated with gold using a Quorum Technologies SC7620 Mini Sputter Coater prior to the analysis. XRD patterns were determined using a Rigaku MiniFlex600 and were generated with CuKα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm, U = 40 kV, and I = 40 mA) in the 2θ range of 2–60°, and a scan speed and scan step of 0.020. The obtained XRD patterns were analyzed using PDXL-2 and were estimated following the Scherrer equation15 in eqn (2), where, D: the crystallite size in nm; θ: the Bragg angle; λ is the wavelength of the radiation; K: constant; and β1/2: corrected width of the peak given by the specimen. The interlayer distance or d-spacing between GO/rGO layers was calculated using Bragg's equation16 (eqn (3)), where, d: interlayer distance; θ: angle of the diffracted wave; n: an integer known as the order of the diffracted beam; and λ: wavelength of the incident X-ray (= 1.54 Å). (2) 2dsinθ = nλ(3)
The presence of functional groups was determined by the FTIR technique using a JASCO FTIR 4100. The samples were milled with KBr and compacted into KBr disks. Transmittances were scanned in the wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm−1. The microstructure evolution of the samples was evaluated using a JASCO NRS-3100 Laser Raman Spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Perkin Elmer Phi 1600 ESCA system was employed to analyze compositions. The surface area, mean pore diameter and total pore volume of the solid catalysts were measured using a Belsorp mini II (BEL Japan Inc.). A tube was filled with the samples under a N2 atmosphere which were then degassed for 24 h at 333 K prior to the measurements at 77 K using nitrogen as the adsorptive gas.
2.4 Catalytic depolymerization method
MW experiments were carried out using a MARS 6 apparatus and an XP1500. In a typical run, MCC, the catalyst and distilled water at prescribed amounts were placed inside the reactor, sealed, and subjected to the desired operating conditions. The temperature was measured using a thermocouple. The samples were cooled down after each reaction. The liquid components (hydrolysates) and solid residues were recovered and separated via filtration in a cold water bath. The residues were washed with 20 ml of distilled water and dried at 333 K for 48 h prior to characterization or reuse. On the other hand, conventional heating was performed using a batch type SUS reactor (inner volume = 6 ml) and an electric heating furnace. The SUS reactor was heated to 240 °C and zero time was taken when the temperature of the reactor reached the set temperature, as measured by the thermocouple.
2.5 Product analysis via HPLC
The products in the filtrate were identified and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a Shodex Sugar SH1011 column at a column temperature of 333 K and 0.3 mM HClO4 eluent at 0.5 mL min−1 equipped with UV and refractive index detectors. Ten microliters of the filtrate was filtered through a syringe filter (pore size = 0.45 microns) and injected into the system. The products were categorized into three: oligosaccharides, glucose and degradation products. Quantification was done using a standard calibration curve from 0.001 M to 0.5 M (R2 = 0.999). The glucose yield (% GY) is defined by eqn (4). The oligosaccharides, mostly cellobiose, were also quantified using a standard calibration curve and eqn (4). The major glucose degradation product detected in the system is 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF). The yield was individually calculated from the initial substrate concentration according to eqn (5), (4) (5)
The current HPLC system/detector used in this study was only limited to measuring oligosaccharides from cellobiose (n = 2) until cellohexaose (n = 6), glucose and degradation products (levulinic acid, acetic acid and 5-HMF). Hence, the carbon-balance cannot be closed.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of rGO as a function of thermally and microwave-induced hydrothermal reduction processes
The reduction of GO through chemical or thermal methods has been widely reported since it is currently the most viable route for the synthesis of graphene for application in batteries, solar cells and supercapacitors.17 By visual inspection alone, notable differences can be observed amongst the catalysts in powder form. GO has a shiny brown-black color whereas rGO1 has a dull-black to grayish black color while rGO2 is deep black. The black color has been attributed to the partial restoration of the conjugation network within the carbon structure.18 The bulk density of the powders also differed significantly, as shown in Table 1. Bulk density is a measure of the compaction of powders and has an impact on the movement of water molecules and solute particles in the system.19 The bulk density was found to decrease in the following order: GO > rGO1 > rGO2. Since rGO2 has the lowest bulk density, it would potentially enable water molecules to diffuse better in between the particles. The substantial differences between the physical properties of the synthesized rGOs prompted us to investigate whether the aqueous environment could have played a role during the reduction process. A variety of techniques were then used to further probe into the characteristics of the synthesized rGOs, as follows.

First, SEM images of GO, rGO1 and rGO2 were obtained and shown in Fig. 1. During the preparation of the specimen samples for analysis, as GO has poor conductivity, the sample was sputter-coated with gold. In contrast, rGO1 and rGO2 did not require a gold coating, demonstrating that the conductivity of rGO has been restored because of the removal of some oxygenated functionalities.20 The microstructures of the samples have no significant differences at 5000× magnification (Fig. 1a–c) as they exhibit coarse and wrinkled structures containing multiple overlapping or stacked nanosheets. This observation suggests that the morphology of the carbon backbone of GO was maintained after reduction. However, at 100× magnification, it was revealed that the particle sizes of rGO2 were much smaller than those of GO and rGO1 (Fig. 1d–f), which can be attributed to the cleaving of the GO sheets during thermal annealing.21,22 For this reason, rGO2 exhibited a significantly higher surface area than rGO1, as supported by BET measurements (Table 1). The larger pore diameter and greater pore volume in rGO2 can be attributed to the formation of nanopores and nanovoids arising from the cleavage of epoxy and C–C bonds.23,24 Surprisingly, despite being reduced, rGO1 had a slightly lower surface area, pore diameter and pore volume. This finding suggests that water molecules may have inhibited the formation of nanovoids and nanopores. In 2009, Zhou et al. extensively studied the effect of hydrothermal reduction to the electronic and optical properties of rGO and concluded that the changes in the dielectric properties and ion product of water under a close system of high temperature and pressure allow for an effective strategy to repair the sp2 network.18 Next, the XRD spectra were obtained and presented in Fig. 2 (left). The starting material Gr has a very narrow peak at 26° (d-spacing = 0.34 nm) while GO has shifted its sharp peak to 10.7° (d-spacing = 0.82 nm, crystallite size = 6.7 nm). Meanwhile, rGO1 has a broad peak (d-spacing = 0.36 nm, crystallite size = 1 nm). The drop in the interlayer distance value for rGO1 and rGO2 indicates that some oxygenated functionalities initially present in GO were removed, which could result into the aggregation of a few layers. The reduction of the crystallite size concurs with the SEM findings. Fig. 2 (middle) shows the FTIR spectra which indicate the characteristic vibrational modes of the functional groups. No functionalities were detected in Gr. Consistent with previous studies,25,26 GO contains four sets of functionalities that are represented as follows: hydroxyls from adsorbed water (broad O–H bond stretching vibration at ∼3393 cm−1 and 1406 cm−1), carbonyls and carboxyls (CO stretching at 1736 cm−1, C–O stretching at 1328 cm−1 and COH at 1046 cm−1) and epoxides (C–O–C stretching at 1221 cm−1). The CC sp2 hybridized carbons (aromatics) is assigned to 1626 cm−1. rGO2 showed lower intensity than rGO1 signifying better restoration of sp2 with hydrothermal synthesis. For both rGO1 and rGO2, weakened intensities of the absorption bands of the O–H vibration at ∼3393 cm−1 were observed, indicating the dehydration of rGO. The carbonyl CO stretching at 1736 cm−1 also diminished. Meanwhile, rGO1 showed a peak assigned to C–H distinct to rGO2 which could be again linked to the presence of water during synthesis.

The reduction on the surface of rGO1 and rGO2 was further confirmed and evaluated using XPS measurements. XPS survey spectra are shown in Fig. S1† while the C 1s and O 1s positions and intensities are summarized in Table 2. The C/O ratio based from the XPS analysis increased from 0.8 (GO) to 2.39 (rGO1) and 1.93 (rGO2). From the combustion elemental analysis results (Table S1†), the C/O ratios for GO, rGO1 and rGO2 were 0.86, 3.16 and 2.64, respectively, thus both rGOs contain a much lower number of oxygen species than GO. The intensities and percentages of the various components (CC–H, sp2 and sp3 carbons, C–H, C–O–C, O–C–O, quinone, π–π*, etc.) highly differ between rGO1 and rGO2. For instance, the increase in sp2 carbon intensities and appearance of π–π* transitions are indicators of the recovery of conjugated structures that were initially disturbed by an oxygenated functionality and signifies restoration of conductive properties. rGO1 has more sp2 carbons than GO as expected due to the hydrothermal reduction and more importantly, developed more C–H, sp3 carbons and C–OH than rGO2. This further supported that the presence of water has the capability to repair defects while recovering the aromatic structures.

Furthermore, the water molecules interacted and incorporated into GO that led to the transformation of its surface structure accompanied by C–C bond cleavage in accordance with the dynamic structural model proposed by Dimiev et al.27 In order to assess structural changes, particularly disorder and defects and defect density, Raman spectra were collected. The prominent D-band (∼1360 cm−1) and G-band (1600 cm−1) peaks have been observed in the three samples shown in Fig. 2 (right), in accordance with published studies.28,29 Both rGO1 and rGO2 exhibited slight bandwidth narrowing relative to GO signifying graphitization and ordering. The ratio of intensities between the D-band and G-band has been commonly used as an indicator for the extent of reduction. For GO, the ID/IG ratio is 0.98, and the smaller intensity of the D-band is characteristic of the oxidized state. Both rGO1 and rGO2 had similar results with an ID/IG value of 1.03. This value, being higher than that of GO is indicative of the removal of the functionalities. However, the ID/IG value for rGO1 and rGO2 is lower than reported reductants such as hydrazine (2.7), vitamin C (2.3) and hydroiodic acid (2.6).30 Thus, both rGO1 and rGO2 were only partially reduced. Lastly, some functionalities are still attached to both the basal plane and along the edges of rGO. It was reported that even at higher temperatures, the full reduction and complete removal of these functionalities are currently impossible.31
The data obtained from the extensive characterization that was carried out indicated that both rGO1 and rGO2 indeed underwent partial reduction. Both suffered from the removal of oxygenated functionalities despite the difference in the preparation route. However, rGO2 possessed better surface properties suitable for catalytic applications than rGO1, owing to the nanopores and nanovoids that developed from thermal annealing. Su et al.32 suggested that the nanopores and nanovoids are active sites, along with the π-electron system, that synergistically trap reactant molecules and facilitate reactions. The nanopores could also offer some pathways for the quick diffusion of reactant molecules and ions into the interlayer spaces.33 We have constructed representative structural models of the synthesized rGO, shown in Scheme 1, using Avogadro molecule editor.34 We have randomly introduced the oxygenated functionalities into GO and randomly removed them following the XPS results. The voids that formed in rGO1 were found to be rich in C–H groups including the peripheries of the sheet. The larger nanopores formed in rGO2 led to the formation of zigzag and armchair orientations which are believed to be catalytically active sites as reported in the reduction of nitroaromatic compounds.35

3.2 Hydrolytic Depolymerization
The catalytic activity of rGO1 and rGO2 was tested from 473–513 K. The individual contributions of MW, subcritical water and rGO1 and rGO2 were benchmarked against conventional heating and other carbon catalysts such as graphite and carbon nanotubes.
MW heating in this study takes place in two distinct circumstances, the first one is via dipolar reorientation and the second one through interfacial polarization (also known as Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars polarization).36 Water, having permanent dipoles, interact with MW through dipolar reorientation. The dipoles reorient and rotate themselves to align with the electric field and their movement results to friction that generates heat. The interaction of water with MW, however, is affected by the changes in its properties with respect to temperature. Marshall and Franck (1981)37 and Uematsu and Frank (1980)38 have extensively characterized the properties of water and steam such as the ion products and static dielectric constants over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. Also, Cantero et al.13 plotted density, ion products and dielectric constants versus temperature to illustrate the general trends and relations. From the aforementioned references, relevant data for this study have been extracted and summarized in Table 3. Density (ρ) signifies the quantity of water molecules per unit volume. With low density, water molecules have better diffusibility. Water molecules also have an intrinsic nature to autodissociate, forming one hydroxyl (H+) and one hydroxide (OH−) ion. The hydroxyl immediately protonates another water molecule, resulting to a hydronium ion (H3O+). The ion product (pKw) represents the extent of dissociation of water and is a measure of the H3O+/OH− concentration inside the system. The dielectric constant (ε) describes the polarizability of molecules in an electric field.39ρ, pKw and ε were found to vary inversely with temperature. More importantly, since the ε value decreases as the temperature increases (Table 3), the ability of water to absorb MW also decreases.

In the absence of a direct measurement of ε for each of the conditions in this study, MW absorption in the system was investigated using heating rates as summarized in Table 4. Heating rates signify the increase in temperature in the system within a certain period of time. A high heating rate value is crucial such that the desired temperature is attained at a shorter period of time and is favorable to minimizing unnecessary reactions and byproduct formation.40 It should be noted that in all conditions tested under MW heating, the heating rates were found to slow down as the temperature is increased. This observation highly correlates with the observed decrease of ε. Thus, under uncatalyzed conditions, corresponding heating rates are generally low (0.86–0.59 K s−1). The introduction of rGO1 increased the heating rates (1.28–0.88 K s−1). This indicates that the presence of a carbon-based catalyst helped overcome the change in the dielectric constant of water, thus, enabling heating to proceed steadily. Carbon-based catalysts interact with MW through interfacial polarization, wherein the movement of electrons essentially matters. Therefore, rGO2 induced much better heating rates than rGO1 as expected, and is attributed to its content of marginal oxygenated functionalities. Moreover, the electron transfer ability is enhanced due to having more sp2 carbons than rGO1 as discussed earlier. Indeed, both rGO1 and rGO2 have better heating rates than GO which we previously reported as 1.06 K s−1.

The heating rates have implications on the heating up time. With MW-subH2O, the desired temperatures were achieved between 8–15 min. Just the heating time alone is already twice or thrice longer than the actual reaction time of 5 min. In the presence of rGO1, heating up was about 15–35% faster than MW-subH2O heating. While CNT has also improved the MW absorbance of the system, both rGO1 and rGO2 were better. Gr, on the other hand, had the lowest heating rate amongst the carbon catalysts tested as it reflects a considerable amount of MWs.41 Thus, not all carbon-based catalysts could be exceptional MW sensitizers. In the absence of the direct measurement of dielectric constants for carbon catalysts, heating rates could serve as a measure of MW–catalyst interaction. Moreover, as the temperature is increased, the heating rates slow down regardless of the presence of a catalyst. It should also be noted that the ability of carbon catalysts to absorb microwave also decreases as the temperature is increased.42
Heating rates under the conventional method are quite different from the MW-induced ones. Under ordinary heating circumstances, the calculated heating rates were <0.1 K s−1. The rather slow heating rate was due to conduction and heat transfer resistance. In order to speed up heating, two heating furnaces were used; the first one was set to a temperature much higher than the desired temperature, i.e. 623 K, where the heating up was carried out. The second furnace was maintained at the target temperature, i.e. 473–513 K, where the reaction was carried out. The heating rates were obtained from the first furnace and once the equilibrium temperature was reached, the reactor was immediately transferred to the second furnace and maintained there for 5 min. The reactor was immediately quenched to suppress any side reactions. The large temperature gradient had enabled the heating rates to be comparable to those of MW-subH2O but was a huge waste of energy. Even so, the time spent for just heating up was about three to four times longer than the actual reaction time of 5 min. Similarly, the heating rate for the conventional system slowed down as the temperature gradient between the system and the furnace became smaller.
3.3 Product distribution and yields
Useful insights were also obtained from the representative HPLC chromatograms as shown in Fig. S2.† A two-step model of cellulose depolymerization would typically indicate the formation of soluble oligosaccharides and soluble sugars.43 The products formed during the depolymerization reaction as determined by HPLC peaks was categorized into: (i) oligosaccharides, displayed prior to ∼16 min; (ii) glucose, assigned to peaks at ∼16 min; and (iii) 5-HMF, as labeled to peaks at ∼39 min.
Comparing ch-subH2O and MW-subH2O, the soluble products were not detected for both at 473 K. Only MW-subH2O showed glucose peaks at 493 K while both managed to produce glucose at 513 K. Since both systems are under the same temperature, it can be established that the heating source indeed affects the depolymerization process. Fan et al. attributed the observed superiority of the MW-induced depolymerization process to the CH2OH pendant groups acting as molecular radiators that initiated the cleavage of the biopolymer chain.44 The CH2OH pendant groups also facilitated the conformational arrangement that promoted accessibility of the β-1,4 glycosidic bond.
In solid–solid reactions, the diffusion of the reactants is the slowest step and thus, governs the rate of reaction. At 473 K, Gr and CNT did not manage to produce glucose. For CNT, this result was unexpected since CNT and rGO share the same sp2 hybridization. It was earlier reported that flat structural properties as that of rGO offer advantages since it has lower diffusion resistance compared with CNT that may have restriction at the tube ends.40 On the other hand, rGO1 managed to generate glucose with minimal oligosaccharides while rGO2 generated more glucose and higher oligosaccharides. This finding indicates that rGO2 has accelerated the depolymerization process better than rGO1. The cleavage of GO sheets during the thermal treatment generated smaller rGO sheets resulting to a large amount of edges21 and nanopores, which has enabled the easy diffusion of the oligosaccharides and the highly reactive hydronium and hydroxyl ions into the nanopores of rGO2 and in between the rGO2 particles. Thus, rGO2 led to a more precise cleavage of the C–O glycosidic bond. The enhanced binding of natural biomolecules including the cellulose dimer that occurs with rGO than with GO has been illustrated by Radic et al.45 using dynamic modelling.
At 493 K, all carbon catalysts generated glucose with oligosaccharides, whereas rGO1 and rGO2 have demonstrated better selectivity to glucose with oligosaccharides that were below quantification limits. Finally at 513 K, all catalysts managed to generate glucose with small quantities of 5-HMF. At this temperature, the contribution of subH2O was highlighted since there is an abundance of hydroxyl and hydronium ions in the system. Aside from the glucose formation, selectivity is enhanced. However, the reactive nature of glucose especially at 513 K, led to its conversion into 5-HMF.
The complete product distribution yields are summarized in Table S2.† The calculated glucose yields are then illustrated in Fig. 3. Overall, the yield of glucose in the investigated temperature range increases as the temperature is increased, owing to the combined weakening of the cellulosic hydrogen bonding network and the auto-dissociation of water. ch-subH2O yielded the lowest glucose yield which was improved in the presence of rGO1 and rGO2. Under conventional heating, rGO2 seemed to perform poorer than rGO1, and this could be associated to the bulkiness of rGO2 that filled up and occupied the entire length of the SUS reactor. This may have restricted the interaction of the bulk cellulose particles with the other rGO2 catalysts and water along the length of the SUS reactor. MW-subH2O generated 11.5 ± 0.1% at 513 K which was close to the 14% reported by Fan et al., at 533 K. This yield was surpassed by rGO1 and rGO2 at 493 K, 15 ± 4.2% and 38 ± 7%, respectively, indicating that the presence of the catalyst has enabled depolymerization at lower temperatures. In addition, the yield of rGO1 with conventional heating and with MW assistance appears to be almost the same. However, it should be noted that under conventional heating, the heating up time is about 18 min, which is only about 8 min under MW irradiation. Hence, the MW assisted conditions have made a significant contribution in shortening the heating up time and eventually the total process time. At 513 K, yields rose to 36 ± 4% and 65.5 ± 3.7% for rGO1 and rGO2, respectively. CNT + MW-subH2O and Gr + MW-subH2O performed poorly compared with rGO + MW-subH2O. The shorter reaction time eases concerns with the use of higher temperatures. The 5 min reaction time was used following an Arrhenius-type temperature dependency profile.

In Table S3 of the ESI,† a summary of the performance of rGO2 in comparison with other carbon-based catalysts was provided. The glucose yields obtained in the present study is second to the yields produced by Prof. Fukuoka's group involving a mechanocatalytic approach and mix-milling. Their work however entails a separate pre-treatment step for the process intensification scheme. Both studies, however, have focused not only on the catalyst structure alone but also the techniques to further improve yields. Tolonen et al.43 have also extensively studied whether subcritical water dissolved the cellulose polymer. If the cellulose was dissolved in MW-subH2O with or without rGO, the formation of a cellulose allomorph or cellulose II as a precipitate would have been observed in the hydrolysate. None of the hydrolysates produced any precipitate even after several days, hinting that solubilization did not take place.
3.4 Spent rGO characterization and reuse
The solid residue at the end of each rGO2-run was collected and characterized. The recovered solid residue closely resembles the fresh rGO2 with a slightly paler black color. However, the mass of the collected solid residue was greater than the input rGO2, indicating the presence of unconverted cellulose. Thus, for this reason, the calculation of conversion and selectivity cannot be accurately obtained. Selectivity should be obtained from reactant conversion rather than from soluble liquid products, following the guidelines stipulated by Hammond, 2017.46
The spent rGO2 was also utilized for a subsequent run (Fig. 4, CYC 2_pure). When used as it is, the yield for the second run was found to decrease from 66% to 43%. This may be attributed to the combined effects of the further removal of the remaining oxygenated functionalities and the blocking of the nanopores and nanovoids due to small cellulose unconverted residues. This can be resolved by mixing fresh rGO2 with spent rGO2 to minimize the decrease in yields. In order to support this claim, additional experiments were then carried out. The catalyst used for a subsequent run consisted of 50% fresh rGO and 50% residue from a previous run, as depicted in Fig. S3.† As shown in Fig. 4, for the second cycle (CYC2_50%), the glucose yield reached ∼55% while that in the third cycle (CYC3_50%) reached ∼52%, indicating that the addition of fresh rGO2 could indeed help improve catalyst performance upon reuse.
 Fig. 4  Catalyst reusability study as a function of the glucose yield. CYC2 PURE – 100% spent rGO2 from 1st cycle; CYC2_50% – 50% spent rGO2 from 1st cycle + 50% fresh rGO2; CYC3_50% – 50% spent rGO2 from 2nd cycle + 50% fresh rGO2. 
The collected residues after each cycle were subjected to XRD, FTIR and XPS analyses to provide some explanation for the decrease in yield (refer to Fig, S4 and S5 and Table S4†). The FTIR spectra showed weaker signals for almost all functionalities originally present in rGO2, confirming the further removal of oxygenated groups. The XRD results, on the other hand, illustrated broad peaks representative of rGO. The amount of oxygen groups were quantified using XPS and the C:O ratio was found to increase from 1.9 in the first cycle to 3.3 in the third cycle, re-affirming the loss of oxygenated functionalities. It has been reported that carbonized cellulose produce a sheet-like structure containing aromatic domain, similar to graphene, with aromatic domains between 1.2–1.3 nm.47 Such nanovoids were much smaller than those in rGO2 hence they cannot fully contribute to the depolymerisation process. Thus, the removal of the remaining oxygenated functionalities and the presence of carbonized cellulose were likely reasons for the decrease in the catalytic activity of the spent rGO2.
3.5 Insights into the mechanism
The key step for a successful cellulose depolymerization into glucose involves the C–O glycosidic bond cleavage, which can be facilitated by Brønsted acids. So far, there are two mechanisms, namely, surface attrition and random scission that has been proposed to explain the occurrence of glucose formation from cellulose via hydrolytic cleaving. In surface attrition, the bulk crystalline structure is peeled layer by layer resulting to shorter soluble chains that easily hydrolyze.22 Under this mechanism, the formation of oligosaccharides is almost negligible and the formation of degradation products is rather slow. Surface attrition is typically associated with surface reactions or depolymerization with solid catalysts. On the other hand, in random scission, the dominant hydrolysis reaction leads to the formation of oligosaccharides at various chain lengths. β-Glycosidic bonds are typically attacked by H+ from a homogeneous acid or H3O+ from the autodissociation of water.48
Based from our results as discussed above, we speculated that the possible mechanism takes place via random scission. The rupture of the C–O glycosidic bond initially produced oligosaccharides, which was further hydrolyzed to give glucose.

Scheme 2 illustrates the sub-stages involved in the whole depolymerization process. First, rGO and water molecules absorb the supplied MW rapidly heating the bulk solution. As the temperature reaches past 473 K, a drastic decrease in the dielectric constant of water took place slowing down the MW absorbance.
 Scheme 2  Proposed reaction mechanism depicting random scission under the synergy of microwave irradiation, reduced graphene oxide and subcritical water. 
Consequently, water underwent auto-dissociation resulting in the formation of H3O+/OH−. The largest H3O+/OH− concentration was achieved at 513 K. The H3O+/OH− ions would randomly cleave the β-glycosidic bonds, forming shorter chain oligosaccharides that can be trapped or adsorbed within the pores or defects of rGO. The H3O+/OH− ions would easily diffuse though the rGO nanopores, further cleaving the oligosaccharides, eventually forming glucose monomers. Due to the highly reactive nature of glucose, the formation of 5-HMF is inevitable, particularly at 513 K. In the proposed reaction mechanism, it was suggested that β-glucans or oligosaccharides could be trapped in between the nanopores and nanovoids of the rGO2 which could have facilitated a faster hydrolysis reaction. We measured the particle size of cellobiose, which was the most detected oligosaccharide or β-glucan, as per the HPLC analysis. We have prepared a solution of cellobiose and measured the particle size using the dynamic light scattering technique (DLS). A representative histogram distribution of the particle size measurement is shown in Fig. S6† wherein the cellobiose particle sizes ranged from 0.6 to 5560 nm with an average of 56 nm. With a nanopore average of about 28 nm, it is possible that cellobiose having particle sizes at the lower segment of the distribution could be trapped into the nanovoids as suggested.
Combining the present analyses with our previous work, we have illustrated the synergism of MW, carbo-carbocatalysis and water towards cellulose depolymerization with respect to temperature, time and glucose yield in Fig. 5. Despite the presence of GO at slightly elevated temperatures (393–433 K), the yields were low and took a significantly long time to attain. This was due to the insufficient ability of the temperature to soften hydrogen bonds and the inadequacy of the weak-acid surface functionalities in GO to enable hydrogen bond disruption, only limiting the hydrolysis of available amorphous regions. When the temperature was increased from 433–473 K, for a reasonable length of time, the highest glucose yields could be obtained. The elevated temperatures enabled better interaction with cellulose, allowing for surface attrition to take place. At subcritical conditions, i.e. 473–513 K, rGO can be used to generate moderately high yields. Since depolymerization took place at very short times, the yield can be increased by running several cycles over a certain period of time.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully demonstrated that rGO can be used to catalyze reactions in synergy with subcritical water under microwave irradiation even without functionalization. rGO acted as a microwave sensitizer to complement the changes in the dielectric properties of water and as adsorption sites owing to the nanopores and nanovoids developed during its synthesis process. The product yield is also governed by the synthesis method for rGO, wherein an atmosphere of inert gas is better than the hydrothermal process. The restoration of sp2 hybridization on the rGO surface facilitated electron mobility, resulting to higher heating rates in the system. rGO has facilitated the precise cleaving of the C–O glycosidic bond, much better than graphite or carbon nanotubes. Microwave has accelerated the reaction by cutting down on heating up time and also by enabling conformational changes leading to the cleavage of the glycosidic bond. Subcritical water has loosened the hydrogen bonding at the surface of cellulose and provided an environment rich of highly reactive H3O+/OH− that could easily diffuse into the nanopores and in between rGO particles, readily accessing sites for protonation.
