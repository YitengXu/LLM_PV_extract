    , Accepted 1st March 2019First published on 1st March 2019AbstractThe available technologies used for the preparation of elemental silicon (Si), including the traditional carbothermal technology of producing bulk Si, pyrolysis-based methods of producing Si nanoparticles and the metallothermic fabrication of state-of-the-art nanostructured Si powder are all considered energy- and time-intensive processes, with associated environmental issues. Herein, for the first time, a combustion synthesis methodology, involving the occurrence of an ignition event followed by the immediate completion of the process, is used for the preparation of nanostructured Si for energy applications. In this process, Si powders are directly extracted from sea sand by a novel ultra-fast shock-wave combustion synthesis (SWCS), in which KClO4 is employed as the combustion agent to promote the immediate reduction of SiO2. The reaction is completed at an ignition temperature of about 550 °C, requiring virtually no dwell time. The process is scalable, green and carbon-free with a low energy consumption of about 100 kW h per ton, less than one percent of that of the current technologies. The Si product possesses a nanostructured mesoporous integrated sheet-like (NMIS) morphology, with an excellent and stable Li storage performance. The mechanism involved in the proposed method is also discussed. The feasibility of the SWCS approach for the preparation of Si is demonstrated in this article, based on which a variety of nanostructured materials is expected to be produced by this method.
1. Introduction
Si has historically played a critical role in technological advancements associated with electronic devices,1 solar energy harvesting,2 and more recently, energy storage systems.3 The latter is because Si can provide the highest theoretical capacity of 4200 mAh g−1 when used as the anode material in Li-ion batteries (LIBs), considerably greater than that of the currently used graphite anodes,4 and other possible alternatives,5–8 fulfilling the capacity and power density requirements of efficient electric vehicles. Therefore, there is a great deal of effort around the globe to solve the technical challenges associated with the utilisation of Si as the anode material,9–14 leading to the development of a new generation of high energy density LIBs with Si anodes for various applications.15–17
However, the question would be whether the production of elemental Si is sustainable and eco-friendly.
Si is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust only after oxygen. Moreover, SiO2 (silica), which is commercially used as the main source of Si, is very widely available. However, Si is traditionally produced on an industrial scale by carbothermal reduction of SiO2 in submerged-arc electric furnaces at extremely high temperatures,18 requiring a substantial electrical energy consumption of about 13 kW h per kilogram of metallurgical-grade Si, which also adversely affects the environment through the emission of more than 17 kg carbon dioxide.19
The carbothermally produced Si can then be used as the raw material for the preparation of chemicals such as monosilane (SiH4) which can then be decomposed at 900–1200 °C to produce Si nanoparticles, for application in LIBs,20–24 with significant environmental and economic drawbacks.
On the other hand, the utilisation of commercially available Si nanoparticles in LIBs requires the involvement of a second phase such as carbon,9 in order to reduce the degradation of the electrode caused by large volume changes occurring during charge–discharge cycles, and the poor electrical conductivity of Si.4 Generally speaking, the incorporation of this second phase is difficult and expensive requiring a large number of chemicals. For instance, Wang et al.25 produced a Si-graphene composite by a method in which commercial silicon nanoparticles were coated with Ni in a solution containing NiCl2·6H2O, NH4Cl, C6H8O7, NaH2PO2, C12H25O4NaS and NH3·H2O followed by treatment of the product with a C6H14O4–NaOH mixture at 185 °C for 14 h, and etching in HNO3, HCl, and HF for several hours. Although the product delivered a remarkable discharge capacity of 1909 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g−1, the complexity and the overall environmental impact of such processes can be a major hindrance.
Alternative methods of producing nanostructured Si, likewise, are generally difficult and expensive to be implemented, and environmentally challenging. For instance, Wang et al.26 produced nanostructured Si–C as a high performance anode material for LIBs by the corrosion of a Si–Al alloy with 1,4-naphthalic acid followed by hydrothermal heat treatments.
Based on the above-mentioned discussion, carbon-free and green extraction of Si nanostructures from SiO2 is highly demanded. To date, the most promising approach to address this key issue is based on the solid state metallothermic reduction of SiO2 to form Si powder, which unfortunately suffers from technical difficulties and lack of scalability. In this approach, Al and Mg have been employed as the reducing agent. The reaction of SiO2 with molten aluminum is challenged by the dissolution of Si formed in molten aluminum, and the formation of a dense alumina layer around the unreacted SiO2 core.27 In contrast, Mg may be considered as an efficient reductant to reduce SiO2 for the carbon-free production of Si and Mg2Si:28–36 2Mg (g) + SiO2 = Si + 2MgO, ΔH° = −312 kJ, ΔG° = −333 kJ per mole of Si (700 °C)(1) 4Mg (g) + SiO2 = Mg2Si + 2MgO, ΔH° = −409 kJ, ΔG° = −477 kJ per mole of Mg2Si (700 °C)(2)
This process, however, suffers from drawbacks that prevent its utilisation on a large scale. Although the changes of Gibbs free energy of reactions (1) and (2) are negative, even at room temperature, these reactions proceed only at relatively high temperatures of above 650 °C in which Mg is in its liquid state. Moreover, the completion of these reactions requires a prolonged heating of 2–7 h at such high temperatures.21–25Eqn (3) and (4) show the dependence of Mg vapor pressure on temperature for solid and liquid Mg, respectively.37,38 logPMg = 5.483 − 7813/T − 0.825logT, T < 650 °C(3) logPMg = 12.660 − 7550/T − 1.410logT, T > 650 °C(4)
These equations imply that the Mg vapor pressure increases by about one order of magnitude and reaches a high value of around 3.6 mbar, upon a small temperature increase from 550 °C to 650 °C. In fact, Mg vapor acts as the main reducing agent at high temperatures. Mg's high vapor pressure at the reduction temperature, therefore, causes technical limitations, since it makes the use of pressure vessels compulsory,39 in order to avoid the loss of Mg. Moreover, it is known that the oxidation of Mg particles exponentially increases with temperature, once a threshold temperature of approximately 570 °C is exceeded,40 which can also be highly corrosive to the surrounding materials,41 imposing technical challenges.42 Hence, simultaneously lowering the reduction temperature and shortening the process time would significantly increase the scalability of the reduction process, being desirable conditions not yet achieved together.
The so called combustion synthesis (CS) is a fast and cost-effective method based on the utilisation of highly exothermic reactions which can spontaneously propagate through the solid reactants, when a critical ignition temperature is reached. As a result, the rate of reaction is very high in CS-based methods. This methodology has provided an efficient way of producing a large number of materials, including metals,43 semiconductors,44–46 intermediate47,48 or intermetallic49,50 phases, ceramics,51–53 composites,54–56 thin films,57 graphene58 and others.59Table 1 shows the reactants and the ignition temperatures determined for a representative number of materials produced by CS approaches. As can be seen, CS has mainly been employed to produce an alloy or compound using elemental44–49 or oxide53,54,57,60,61 reactants with various applications including as anode53,61 and cathode54,60 materials for LIBs. It can also be seen that relatively high amounts of organic and/or organometallic components are required, which may cause environmental pollution.

Moreover, as can be seen from Table 1, the preparation methods of nanostructured elemental materials using CS are scarce, and are, to the best of our knowledge, limited to Co nanopowders produced from Co(NO3)2·6H2O as the source material.43
In this paper, for the first time we report on the ultra-fast CS of Si from SiO2. It should be mentioned that usually SiO2 may not be reduced to Si in a CS mode, owing to its high thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. Consequently, the reactions (1) and (2) don't represent the characteristics of a CS process, and hence need a long time to be completed at high temperatures, such as 650 °C/7 h,62 as shown in Table 1. This is because these reactions possess a moderate enthalpy of product formation even at 700 °C, about −312 kJ and −409 kJ, respectively. For producing Si from SiO2 by a CS method, these thermodynamic values should be engineered towards more negative values. Here, we report on the ultra-fast shock-wave combustion synthesis of Si from SiO2 for its application as the anode material for LIBs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Ultra-fast preparation of NMIS-Si
Pristine sand collected from the shore of Winterton-On-Sea in east England was used as the Si source. The samples were washed with distilled water and dried overnight. They were then ball milled for 5 h with a planetary ball milling device using a polymer container and alumina balls with a ball:sand ratio of 10:1. The ball milled sand was dried at 100 °C overnight. For a typical experiment, 37 g ball-milled sand was dried at 100 °C and thoroughly mixed with 51 g Mg powder (Sigma Aldrich 254126, 20–230 mesh) and 4.1 g KClO4 powder (Sigma Aldrich 241830). The mixture was placed in an alumina crucible and was repeatedly pounded using a mallet.
The crucible was then covered with an alumina bung, and placed in a stainless steel reactor (see the inset in Fig. 1d and also Fig. 3). The empty space in the reactor was filled with NaCl. The presence of the NaCl powder is desirable to dampen the shock generated by the reaction taking place in the alumina crucible. It also further protects the reaction mixture and the products from the environment. NaCl is easy to remove (e.g. by simple aqueous washing) after the reaction has completed without deleterious effect on the recovered silicon or silicide.

(e) and (f) SEM micrographs of the as-synthesised product after washing. (g) XRD and (h) Raman spectrum of samples. (i) SEM/EDX mapping of the as-synthesised product after washing. 
The reactor was placed in a retort furnace, and the retort was vacuumed to less than 1 mbar and heated whilst the temperature was monitored by a thermocouple. After the reaction was complete, the furnace was turned off and the retort was left to cool down to room temperature. Then, the alumina crucible was removed and its content was collected. The material obtained was gradually transferred into a water cooled bath containing H2SO4 (95%) in 20 min, whilst the suspension was stirred. A solid powder material (with yellowish color) was subsequently retrieved from the suspension by vacuum filtration. The product was then repeatedly washed with distilled water, and then dried in a vacuum of 10−2 mbar at 50 °C for 2 h.
2.2. Structural, morphological and thermokinetic characterisation
Electron microscopy investigations were carried out on a FEI Nova Nano-SEM and a 200 kV FEI Tecnai F20 field emission gun high resolution TEM (HRTEM). A Philips 1710 X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation (wavelength = 0.157 nm) was used to record the diffraction patterns. The Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns was performed using High-Score Plus software. Raman data were collected using a Renishaw 1000 Raman microscope system with a He–Ne ion laser of 633 nm wavelength (red, 1.96 eV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on an ESCA 2000 spectrometer (VG Microtech) using monochromated Al Kα radiation. Porosity properties of the Si product, i.e., specific surface area and pore size distribution, were calculated from low-temperature nitrogen gas adsorption–desorption isotherms obtained with a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 V6.04 A analyser at −196 °C (77 K). Prior to recording the isotherms, the sample was outgassed under high-purity nitrogen at 105 °C for 24 h. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) investigation was performed using an SDT Q600 analyser equipped with alumina crucibles.
2.3. Electrochemical characterisation
The electrochemical properties of the electrodes made of mesoporous Si and commercially available Si nanoparticles as Li-ion battery anode materials were investigated using 2032-type coin cells, in which lithium foil was used as the counter electrode and 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and diethyl carbonate (EC:DMC:DEC = 2:2:1 by volume) containing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC, 10 vol%) as the electrolyte. The electrodes were prepared on Cu foil (thickness: 10 μm) from a mixture of 70 wt% Si material and 15 wt% carbon black as the conductive carbon and 15 wt% binder. The binary binder was prepared with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA, 3 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich, Mv = 3000000) and sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose (NaCMC, 1 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich, Mw = 700000) in a 1:1 weight ratio. The prepared electrodes were vacuum dried at 150 °C for 3 h. The slurry loading on the electrodes was 1.40–1.60 mg. The reported capacities were based on the weight of Si, and the electrochemical characteristics were measured in the range of 0.01–2.50 V versus Li/Li+ using a Princeton Applied Research VMP2 potentiostat/galvanostat. The Si nanoparticles, produced by a laser pyrolysis technique using gaseous SiH4, were obtained from a commercial producer. The nanoparticles were spherical in shape with a typical particle size in the range 10–100 nm, as exhibited in the TEM micrograph of Fig. S4.†Fig. 2g and h demonstrate that the material is crystalline silicon.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Ultra-fast preparation of NMIS-Si
Here, we propose an ultra-fast process for complete magnesiothermic reduction of SiO2 sand at an ignition temperature of about 550 °C, with no compulsory dwell time. The SWCS approach proposed here not only is carbon-free but also highly energy efficient. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) morphology of the pristine sand collected from the British North Sea coast (Fig. 1a) shows the presence of SiO2 particles of about 200 to 600 μm in size with smooth surfaces. A sample of this material was ball-milled using a planetary ball milling machine with polymer containers and alumina balls, and a ball:powder ratio of 10:1 for 5 h. Fig. 1b shows a representative SEM micrograph of the ball-milled powder, demonstrating the reduction of the sand's particle size to typically less than 200 μm. Moreover, it was clear that each particle in the milled sand is in fact an agglomeration of much smaller particles.
In this study, KClO4 was employed as the shock-wave combustion agent to promote the magnesiothermic reduction of SiO2 in a CS mode. For this, a mixture of about 11 mg ball-milled SiO2 and 1 mg KClO4 was examined in a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) instrument, with a nitrogen flow of 100 ml min−1 under a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The DSC thermogram obtained, shown in Fig. 1c, demonstrates the presence of an endothermic peak at 316 °C corresponding to the phase transformation of KClO4 from its rhombic to cubic phase.63 The second endothermic peak at 594 °C is attributed to the phase transition of quartz (sand) from the α-trigonal to β-hexagonal crystalline structure.64 The intense exothermic peak at 632 °C is due to the decomposition of KClO4 as shown below.63 KClO4 = KCl + 2O2, ΔG° = −297 kJ per mole of KClO4 (632 °C)(5)
The corresponding DSC thermogram exhibited new features when about 15 mg Mg was added to the SiO2 + KClO4 feed material, as presented in Fig. 1c. In this case, the KClO4 phase transformation temperature was recorded at a lower temperature of 308 °C, due to the enhancement of the thermal conductivity of the feed material brought about by the presence of Mg. There is no sign of the quartz phase transition; but instead, an exothermic peak commencing at about 570 °C and centered at 619 °C can be observed. This peak can be attributed to the magnesiothermic reduction of quartz in the presence of KClO4. The last endothermic peak at 658 °C is attributed to the melting of the remaining Mg.
The results obtained were used to develop an ultra-fast method for the reduction of SiO2. For this, 37 g ball-milled sand was dried at 100 °C and mixed with 51 g Mg powder and 4.1 g KClO4 powder. The mixture was loaded into an alumina crucible with an alumina bung, and the crucible was then placed in a stainless steel reactor (inset in Fig. 1d). The empty space in the reactor was filled with NaCl powder. Then the reactor was heated in a resistance vertical furnace. More details can be found in the ESI.† During the heating process, the temperature was continuously recorded by a thermocouple attached to the crucible bung, and the temperature–time profile obtained is shown in Fig. 1d. An exothermic event at about 550 °C can be depicted in the thermogram, which leads to an accelerated increase in the temperature profile at a rate of about 100 °C min−1.
The reaction occurring at this temperature can be formulated, based on the amount of the initial materials used: 0.616SiO2 + 2.098Mg + 0.030KClO4 = 0.243Si + 1.352MgO + 0.030KCl + 0.373Mg2Si, ΔH° = −1166 kJ (and −760 kJ), ΔG° = −1067 kJ (and 695 kJ) per mole of Si (and Mg2Si) (550 °C)(6)
The enthalpy of reaction (6) is considerably more negative than that of reactions (1) and (2), enabling the process to progress in a CS mode. Upon the occurrence of the reaction, the furnace was turned off and the reactor was left to cool down to room temperature. The reaction product obtained was then washed with distilled water, and vacuum dried at 80 °C overnight before further characterisation.
The SEM micrographs of the material obtained show the presence of particles with sizes less than 200 μm (Fig. 1e). Each particle had a nanostructured morphology (Fig. 1f), in which nanocrystals of MgO and Mg(OH)2 with a size of typically less than 300 nm are located on a Mg2Si/Si substrate, as suggested by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis shown in Fig. 1i. The XRD patterns of the ball-milled sand and the as-synthesised material obtained after the washing process are shown in Fig. 1g. It can be seen that the ball-milled sand consisted of SiO2 in the quartz structure with no detectable contamination originating from the milling media. It can also be observed that the sand completely reacted with Mg to form Mg2Si, Si and MgO at such a low temperature and virtually no dwelling time by the SWCS approach. Mg(OH)2 was formed by the hydration of MgO. The characteristic Raman bands of crystalline SiO2, Mg2Si and Si, appearing at 464, 255 and 525 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 1h), support the XRD results.
In order to simultaneously remove MgO and Mg(OH)2, and also convert the Mg2Si content to Si, the hybrid product was gradually transferred into a water cooled bath containing H2SO4 (95%) in 20 min, whilst the suspension was stirred. The reaction that occurred can be described as follows: Mg2Si + 2H2SO4 = 2MgSO4 + 2H2 (g) + Si, ΔG° = −840 kJ (25 °C)(7)
A yellowish powder was subsequently retrieved from the suspension by vacuum filtration. The product was then repeatedly washed with distilled water, and dried in a vacuum of 10−2 mbar at 50 °C for 2 h. The SEM micrographs of the acid-treated sample (Fig. 2a–c and S2†) show that the sample is composed of particles with various sizes less than 200 μm, and that the particles possess a nanostructured sheet-like morphology with high porosity. The EDX spectrum recorded on a sheet-like porous particle, shown in Fig. 2c, is exhibited in Fig. 2d, demonstrating a Si:O ratio of 26.2. The carbon signal in the spectrum originates from the carbon substrate used in the SEM microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations, shown in Fig. 2e, demonstrate that the porous Si structure formed is composed of semi-transparent sheets and nanoparticles of several tens of nanometers. The higher magnified TEM micrograph in Fig. 2f provides evidence that the NMIS-Si produced contains highly crystalline silicon domains. The XRD pattern in Fig. 2g demonstrates that the product is pure Si. Moreover, Fig. 2h exhibits the presence of a Raman band characteristic of crystalline Si in the NMIS-Si at 518 cm−1. The XRD and Raman spectra of commercially available Si nanoparticles with a mean particle size of around 100 nm (Fig. S4†) are also presented for comparison. Based on these observations, it can be assumed that the acid treatment of the MgSi2/MgO hybrid material produced by the SWCS approach leads to removal of Mg from the cubic structure of Mg2Si, and also MgO, leaving behind a porous sheet-like Si with a cubic structure.
The ultra-fast reduction of the sand material in this study is attributed to the presence of KClO4 in the system, which thermodynamically promotes the reduction reaction by lowering the changes of Gibbs free energy of the reduction reaction. Besides, KClO4 could also provide kinetic enhancements by creating shock waves upon the reaction with Mg, which could subsequently create microcracks on the SiO2 particles (Fig. S1†), enhancing the magnesiothermic reduction process. Fig. 3 illustrates the SWCS synthesis methodology proposed in this study for the ultra-fast and carbon-free reduction of sand.

The isotherm obtained by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption analysis, presented in Fig. S3,† displays a type-IV isotherm and a type-H4 hysteresis loop, which is indicative of multilayer adsorption onto surfaces and capillary condensation within mesopores.65 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of NMIS-Si was determined to be 137 m2 g−1.
3.2. Li storage performance of the nanostructured silicon produced
The lithium storage performance of the electrodes made of NMIS-Si produced as well as those of the electrodes made of commercially available Si nanoparticles (Fig. 2g, h and S4†) was investigated using 2032-type coin cells. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) recorded for the electrodes fabricated using NMIS-Si at a scan rate of 0.10 mV s−1 during the first 20 cycles are presented in Fig. 4a. In the first reduction scan, a broad irreversible cathodic peak centered at around 0.67 V can be observed, which is associated with the reduction of the electrolyte and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film on the electrode. There is also a cathodic peak at around 0.20 V, which can be attributed to the formation of LixSi phases.66 The decomposition of these phases can be identified by the presence of two clear peaks in the first anodic scan at 0.33 and 0.50 V. Besides, the CV curves were completely overlapped with each other after the 8th cycle, demonstrating the excellent cyclability of the electrode. During the cycling tests, the first three cycles were tested at a current density of 0.10 A g−1 to imply the activation process (Fig. S5†). The first charge and discharge capacities at this rate were obtained as 2654 and 3100 mA h g−1, representing an initial coulombic efficiency (CE) of 85.62%. The initial capacity loss observed is most likely to be due to the irreversible SEI layer formation as well as the highly porous structure of the nanostructured Si.67 Notably, the first CE value is comparable with many previous state-of-the-art studies, and may still be improved by the addition of carbonaceous materials, surface engineering, the prelithiation strategy, and the electrolyte modification. The charge/discharge capacities decreased to 2382/2580 mA h g−1 and 2407/2431 mA h g−1 in the 2nd and 3rd cycles, equal to the CE values of 92.33 and 99.01%, respectively. After a few more cycles, the CE value increased to more than 99.90%, and remained constant up to 150 cycles. For comparison, the commercial Si nanoparticles delivered a charge/discharge capacity of 1842/2356 mA h g−1 in the first cycle, (CE = 78.19%), which reduced to 1795/1878 mA h g−1 (CE = 95.58% CE) after three cycles. Fig. 4b depicts the charge–discharge profiles of NMIS-Si for selected cycles at 0.50 A g−1. The profiles vividly exhibit excellent reversibility of NMIS-Si for 150 cycles, reaching 1644/1648 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 74.74% at this current density. As exhibited in Fig. 4c, in contrast with the target mesoporous Si, commercial Si exhibited continuous capacity fading, reaching an eventual discharge capacity value of 479 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.
 Fig. 4  The electrochemical performance of the electrode made of NMIS-Si: (a) CV curves for the first 20 cycles in the voltage range of 0.01–2.50 V vs. Li/Li+ at 0.10 mV s−1 scan rate, and (b) charge–discharge voltage profiles for the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 20th, 50th, 100th, and 150th cycles. Comparison of the electrochemical performance of NMIS-Si and the commercial Si electrodes: (c) cycling stability at a current density of 0.50 A g−1, and (d) rate performance at charge–discharge current densities of 0.10–5.00 A g−1. (e) Significant high-rate cycling stability and coulombic efficiency of the NMIS-Si electrode at 2.00 A g−1 for 500 cycles. The first three cycles in (c) and (e) were tested at 0.10 A g−1 for activation. (f) A schematic representation illustrating the structural change occurring upon the lithiation of NMIS-Si and the non-porous (bulk) Si nanoparticles. The mesoporous integrated structure of sheet-like Si in NMIS-Si excellently endures the volume changes, and greatly enhances the mass transportation. 
Furthermore, the rate capability of the two samples was evaluated, as illustrated in Fig. 4d and S6.† These results unambiguously indicate that the NMIS-Si sample exhibits a superb electrochemical performance in terms of initial CE%, cycling stability, and rate capability, principally on account of its porous nature and structural integrity. Such a microstructure could effectively endure the severe volume changes occurring upon repeated cycling processes. To further endorse the above-mentioned results, we tested the NMIS-Si sample at a high current rate of 2.00 A g−1, and surprisingly, an excellent cycling performance was achieved (Fig. 4e). This performance is considerably greater than that of commercially used graphite anodes and comparable with the state-of-the-art Si-based nanocomposites reported in the literature.9 Fig. S7† compares our LIB results with those of the previous reports on porous Si-based anodes, further confirming the excellent LIB performance achieved in this work.
Furthermore, we conducted ex situ XRD analysis to unveil the electrochemical reactions during the charge and discharge processes. Fig. 5a depicts the XRD patterns of the NMIS-Si electrode before cycling, and after the 2nd discharge and charge. The obvious Si peaks could be detected in the primary electrode, while the peaks completely vanished after discharge, and new peaks associated with the two Li22Si5 and Li15Si4 phases appeared as a result of the discharge process. These new phases again disappeared after the subsequent charging process, and Si peaks were observed, indicating the high level of reversibility of the electrode during lithiation and de-lithiation reactions.
 Fig. 5  (a) Ex situ XRD pattern of the NMIS-Si electrode before the cycling tests, as well as those of disassembled cells (2nd cycle, tested at 0.10 A g−1) in both charged and discharged states. The high-resolution XPS (b) C 1s, (c) F 1s, and (d) Li 1s spectra of the discharged NMIS-Si electrode, and those of the electrodes after the 1st and 100th cycles (at 0.50 A g−1), demonstrating an exceptional stability of the target NMIS-Si structure to control the volume changes during charge and discharge processes. 
In addition, to reveal the composition changes of the SEI layer during cycling, the cells were disassembled after the 1st and 100th cycles in the discharged state, and the active materials recovered were analysed using XPS analysis. Fig. 5b–d present the high-resolution XPS C 1s, F 1s, and Li 1s spectra, respectively. A clear Li2CO3 peak was detected at around 289.7 eV in the C 1s spectrum of the 1st cycled sample, which originated from fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) in the electrolyte.68 After 100 cycles, this peak became slightly larger, suggesting that a limited amount of extra electrolyte has been decomposed, contributing to SEI formation after durable cycles. It also highlights the stability of the initial SEI film after 100 cycles. According to Fig. 5c and d, the sharp peaks appearing at around 684.8 and 55.8 eV, respectively, belong to the LiF phase, which is a crucial inorganic component of the SEI film. The similarity of the peaks between the 1st and 100th cycles again demonstrates the stability and quality of the SEI layer, principally due to the well-designed electrode structure with abundant mesopores, which hinders the excessive pulverisation of the NMIS-Si electrode during cycling through effective accommodation of the volume variations, as well as reducing the irreversible side reactions and electrolyte decomposition. The abundant mesopores were also highly beneficial for the enhanced ion and electron transportation compared to the commercial spherical Si nanoparticles (Fig. 4f). Furthermore, the impedance spectroscopy analysis demonstrated the enhanced kinetics of lithium insertion/extraction into/from the NMIS-Si electrode (see ESI and Fig. S8†).
It should eventually be mentioned that silicon nanoparticles are commercially produced by laser pyrolysis techniques using gaseous precursors such as SiH4 at high temperatures,69 which is both expensive and also environmentally hazardous. This is because SiH4 is a flammable and toxic gas, with a number of reported fatal industrial accidents.70–72 Moreover, SiH4 is produced using metallurgical grade Si, increasing the overall cost and the environmental impacts. The methodology proposed here may provide a breakthrough in the low cost and carbon-free preparation of Si and other nanostructured materials for various applications.
4. Conclusions
An effective and ultra-fast shock-wave combustion synthesis method was developed for the green reduction of SiO2 to produce Mg2Si and Si, based on the magnesiothermic reduction of ball-milled SiO2 sand in the presence of KClO4. In this process, the reaction is completed immediately at the ignition temperature of about 550 °C, without the requirement of any dwell time. The energy consumption of the process was calculated to be less than 100 kW h per ton of Si, without the generation of CO2 greenhouse emission. Mg2Si was effectively converted to Si by a simple acid treatment. The synthesised Si had a mesoporous sheet-like microstructure with a BET surface area of 137 m2 g−1, and could exhibit an impressive performance when used as the anode material for LIBs.
