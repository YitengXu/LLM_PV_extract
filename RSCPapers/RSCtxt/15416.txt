    , Accepted 11th March 2021First published on 12th March 2021AbstractPhotothermal therapy is promising for augmenting cancer therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-conjugated polymer nanoparticles are in focus due to their dual photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy functions. Herein, the design and synthesis of three near-infrared absorbing conjugated polymers, named DPP-SO, DPP-SS and DPP-SSe, with heteroatom substitution of the thiophene moiety were developed for a photoacoustic imaging guided photothermal therapy. It was demonstrated that systematically changing only the heteroatom from O to S or Se could apparently adjust the absorption spectrum and energy gap of DPP-conjugated polymers to obtain the most suitable photothermal transduction agents (PTAs) for use in biomedicine. The characterization of photophysical properties proved that the photothermal conversion efficiency and absorption coefficient of DPP-SO nanoparticles under 808 nm irradiation was up to 79.3% and 66.51 L g−1 cm−1, respectively, which were much higher than those of DPP-SS and DPP-SSe nanoparticles. Remarkably, the IC50 value of DPP-SO for killing A549 cells was half that of DPP-SS and DPP-SSe nanoparticles. Further in vivo works demonstrated efficient photothermal therapeutic effects of DPP-SO nanoparticles with the guidance of photoacoustic imaging. Thus, this is an efficient method to regulate the photothermal performance of DPP-conjugated polymers by changing the heteroatom in the molecular skeleton.
Introduction
Photothermal therapy (PTT) is anticipated to be an alternative approach for future clinical anti-cancer therapeutics applications as it exhibits minimal invasiveness and allows more controlled therapies, unlike the conventional treatment.1–5 PTT is a new technology to develop photothermal transduction agents (PTAs), which kill cancer cells depending on instant temperature alteration but rely on the irradiation of a near-infrared laser.6,7 More remarkable, the acoustic waves generated by the photothermal effect also can be converted into imaging signals, known as photoacoustic (PA) imaging.8–12 The visualization treatment of light and heat, in other words, PA imaging performed simultaneously in PTT, is tremendously valuable due to their biocompatibility and responsiveness toward external lasers in cancer therapy.13,14 Research towards developing effective PTAs has been undertaken for PA/PTT usage in anti-tumour fields for a long time, but most reported PTAs, such as inorganic materials, as represented by gold nanorods, silver nanoparticle and graphene oxide, are limited in clinical applications due to their poor biocompatibility and biodegradation.15–17 On the contrary, conjugated polymers (CPs) have attracted much attention because of their outstanding light absorption performance and delocalized π-conjugated backbones.13,18,19 More notably, CPs can be easily encapsulated into biocompatible polymer matrices to form uniform and stable conjugated polymers nanoparticles (CPNs) with small sizes, good water dispersibility and biocompatibility, which have been shown to be superior to some inorganic materials.20–24 It has been reported that many CPNs with near-infrared absorption have good PTT and PA effects, but how to regulate CPs to have a more effective photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) and to be less disruptive to natural tissue is still a challenge.25,26
Through regulating radiative and non-radiative decay pathways to harvest more energy from light and by converting the energy into heat, CPs are applied to biomedicine by precisely designing the backbone structures of CPs. Above all, obtaining an appropriate feasible molecular engineering strategy to ameliorate the comprehensive design of CPs for achieving a higher extinction coefficient and SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) of the photoacoustic signal should be considered, even though it has not been much investigated.
To the best of our knowledge, thiophene-based conjugated polymers have been mostly used for photovoltaic applications.27 Several niches also exist using changed chalcogenide elements by substituting O to S to Se, to change heteroatoms in the five-membered heterocycle for a more red-shifted wavelength, stronger planar backbone and smaller optical energy gap.28,29 Consequently, switching to a heavier element, like sulfur or selenium, with greater polarizability is of great significance because the larger atomic radius probably can promote intermolecular interactions, which would then affect the light absorption characteristics.30 However, a small bandgap does not directly guarantee a high conversion efficiency of solar cell devices, as do PTAs.27 According to Janssen, relatively low-lying LUMO levels may lead to poor charge separation and thus a low internal quantum efficiency (IQE), meanwhile the HOMO level increases fractionally. The results indicated in Fig. 2C show that by increasing the size of the chalcogen atom (O < S < Se), polymer band gaps are narrowed mainly due to LUMO energy level stabilization, which provides for the poor charge separation caused by the more polarizable selenophene than either sulfur or oxygen.28 However, the larger heteroatomic size only leads to a very small raising of EHOMO.29 In addition, the larger heteroatomic size leads to a poor orbital overlap between the heteroatom and the π-system located on the carbon atoms, leading to a poor planar backbone. For these reasons, the effect of the heteroatom substitution on the photothermal effect for PTAs is worth discussing.28
These features may contribute to creating highly efficient PTAs and reveal the relationships between the structure and performance.31,32 Nevertheless, considering the application of PTA in biomedicine, deeper penetration and higher permissible exposure of near-infrared light must be paid attention to. So, 808 nm lasers have been particularly favoured by researchers due to the deeper tissue penetration than with a 660 nm laser and as less oxyhaemoglobin is absorbed than with the 980 nm laser.33 Above all, it is very necessary to further clarify the effects of heteroatom substitution to develop novel heteroatom polymers for PA/PTT cancer ablation, even though elucidating the relationship between chalcogenide variation and performance is challenging.
In this paper, three diketopyrrolopyrrole-conjugated polymers tagged as DPP-SO, DPP-SS and DPP-SSe were synthesized via a Stille coupling reaction (Fig. 1). The molecular structures of the three CPs were largely similar except for systematically changing an individual atom from O to S and Se. These CPs were encapsulated in amphipathic DSPE-PEG2000 to form nanoparticles (NPs) with a uniform size. Then, the relationship between the molecular structure and properties (ultraviolet spectrum, absorption coefficient and photothermal behaviour) was studied. The newly designed polymer DPP-SO showed excellent photothermal performance with a PCE over 79% and mass extinction coefficient up to 66.51 L g−1 cm−1 under 808 nm irradiation. More strikingly, their most excellent anti-tumour activity in vitro and tumour ablation and biological safety in vivo also further proved that the DPP-SO NPs were a promising contrast agent for PA imaging and PTT. Taken together, our findings utilize a heteroatom substitution strategy to develop the photothermal efficiency of PTAs, providing applications that make possible a variety of new types of PTAs and PA diagnostic agents.

Experimental section
Materials and characterization
All the purchased reagents were not further purified after being supplied from the reagent supplier. 1H NMR spectra were characterized with a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer. UV-vis-NIR adsorption spectra were measured by a LS 55 luminescence spectrometer. The morphology and size of the three CPNs were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) was applied for the theoretical calculations on the basis of the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6-311+(d,p) level. All thermal infrared images were captured by a Fluke Ti480 thermal imaging camera. PA imaging was recorded with the MOST imaging system, and DMol3 code was used to evaluate the local exchange correlation energy of the three CPNs.34,35
Synthesis of DPP-SO, DPP-SS and DPP-SSe

DPP-SO: first, 3,6-bis(5-bromofuran-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octylundecyl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo-[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (0.1 mmol, 95 mg) and 2,5-bis(2-octylundecyl)-3,6-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (0.1 mmol, 106 mg) were added to a 50 mL three-neck flask, and 10 mL anhydrous toluene was added to dissolve them, then 20 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added under the protection of a nitrogen atmosphere. Stirring overnight at 110 °C, the reaction solution was first precipitated with methanol (50 mL), and then Soxhlet extraction of the precipitate was carried out with hexane and chloroform, respectively. Finally, DPP-SO was obtained by recrystallization with methanol/water (v/v = 10:1) as a dark blue powder (76.5 mg, 47%). 1H NMR (CDCl3), δ (ppm) 9.68–8.28 (d, 4 H), 7.52–7.35 (m, 2 H), 7.13–6.46 (m, 2 H), 4.04 (m, 8 H), 2.31–0.85 (m, 124 H). GPC (THF, polystyrene standard), Mn: 3.23 × 104 g mol−1, PDI: 2.3. The similar preparation process of DPP-SO was applied to obtain DPP-SS and DPP-SSe. DPP-SS: dark blue power (72.6 mg, 44%), 1H NMR (CDCl3), δ (ppm) 9.61–8.61 (m, 4 H), 7.68–7.30 (m, 2 H), 7.17–6.96 (m, 2 H), 4.15 (m, 8 H), 2.03–0.84 (m, 122 H). GPC (THF, polystyrene standard), Mn: 2.67 × 104 g mol−1, PDI: 1.6. DPP-SSe: dark blue power (82.8 mg, 48%), 1H NMR (CDCl3), δ (ppm) 9.23–7.95 (m, 4 H), 7.68–7.35 (m, 2 H), 7.10–7.00 (m, 2 H), 4.05 (m, 8 H), 2.42–0.88 (m, 122 H). GPC (THF, polystyrene standard), Mn: 2.81 × 104 g mol−1, PDI: 2.1.
Preparation of DPP-SO, DPP-SS and DPP-SSe NPs
After 1 mg of DPP-SO or DPP-SS or DPP-SSe and 10 mg of DSPE-PEG2000 were thoroughly dissolved in 1 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF), the mixed solution was slowly dripped into deionized (DI) water (9 mL) under stirring. The solution was then stirred overnight to completely remove THF. Subsequently, the resulting solution was filtered with a filter membrane (0.22 μm) to obtain DPP-SO, DPP-SS and DPP-SSe NPs.
Photothermal properties of DPP-SO, DPP-SS and DPP-SSe NPs
We recorded the temperature variation every 30 s by using a Fluke Ti480 thermal imaging camera when 0.5 mL of these CPNs dispersions (5, 10, 15 μg mL−1) were irradiated with an 808 nm laser (0.8 W cm−2, 5 min). The photothermal conversion efficiencies (η) of these CPNs were respectively calculated according to the reported equation (see ESI† for the detailed calculation).23 Meanwhile, the photothermal stability of these CPNs was respectively tested. Following irradiation for 10 min, the solution was subjected to five heating and cooling cycles.
Cytotoxicity
Human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) and human small cell lung cancer cells (H446) were provided by the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China). Both A549 and H446 cells were respectively inoculated in 96-well plates (5 × 103 cell per well), and then the cells were respectively incubated with three CPNs (0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 μg mL−1) for 4 h. After these cells were irradiated using an 808 nm laser for 5 min (0.8 W cm−2), incubation was continued for 24 h. Subsequently, the culture medium was removed and the cells were incubated with 90 μL fresh DMEM medium containing 10 μL CCK-8. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader after 1 h. All the experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results compared with the OD value of the untreated cells, and expressed as the mean ± SD.
Cell imaging
Calcein/AM and propidium iodide (PI) were used to determine cell viability. The A549 cells were respectively inoculated in 6-well plates (105 cell per well), and then the culture medium was replaced by DMEM medium containing DPP-SO NPs (25 μg mL−1) and irradiated with a laser (808 nm, 0.8 W cm−2, 5 min). After 4 h, calcein-AM and PI were co-cultured with the cells at 37 °C for 30 min, and the images were observed under a fluorescence microscopy.
Flow cytometry analysis
First, A549 cells were cultured in 6-well plates (105 cell per well) overnight. Then, the cells treated with DPP-SO NPs (25 μg mL−1) were exposed to a laser (808 nm, 0.8 W cm−2) for 5 min, and incubation continued with 5 μL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL of PI for 10 min. The apoptosis of A549 cells were measured with a flow cytometer. All the tests were repeated three times to ensure accuracy.
PA imaging in vivo
The A549 tumour-bearing nude mice were created by subcutaneous injection of A549 cells (4 × 106). Then 100 μL of DPP-SO NPs (1 mg mL−1) was injected into the caudal vein of the tumour-bearing mice. After different dosing times (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h), PA images of the nude mice were recorded using a MOST imaging system. The images were analyzed using with the View MSOT software suite for the optimal treatment time.
Thermal imaging in vivo
We respectively injected the A549 tumour-bearing nude mice with 100 μL of PBS and DPP-SO NPs (1 mg mL−1 body weight) solution when the volume of tumour reached about 100 mm3. After 9 h, the tumour region of the designated groups was exposed to an 808 nm laser (0.8 W cm−2, 5 min), and the rising temperature of the tumour was recorded by a Fluke Ti480 thermal imaging camera.

In vivo tumour elimination and biosafety evaluation
All the animal experiments were approved by the Animal Management and Ethics Committee of Henan University. After the tumour volume of the A549 tumour-bearing nude mice reached about 100 mm3, we randomly divided the tumour-bearing nude mice into four groups: PBS, Laser, DPP-SO NPs and DPP-SO NPs + laser groups. PBS (100 μL) was injected into each mouse by the caudal vein in the PBS and laser groups and 100 μL of DPP-SO NPs (1 mg kg−1) was injected for the other two groups. After 9 h, the tumour region in the nude mice was exposed to an 808 nm laser (0.8 W cm−2) for 5 min. The tumour volume and body weight of the mice were recorded every two days.
After 16 days, the treated animals were sacrificed under anaesthesia and then the main organs were taken out for biosafety evaluation and to assess the therapeutic effect on the tumour. We collected the plasma of the mice for biochemical and blood routine analysis, and the tumours and main organs, including liver, heart, lung, spleen and kidney, for haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Photographs were imaged under an optical microscope.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of all three polymers (DPP-SO, DPP-SS and DPP-SSe) is shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI† by palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling reactions. All three polymers with a heteroatom of the thiophene unit systematically changed from O to S to Se to afford high number average molecular weights (Mn) of 32.3, 26.7 and 28.1 kDa for DPP-SO, DPP-SS and DPP-SSe, respectively. As expected, the effect of heteroatom substitution was clearly observable in the absorption spectra of these CPs in THF, where DPP-SSe and DPP-SS showed a significant red-shift from 900 nm for DPP-SO to 912 nm for DPP-SS and 960 nm for DPP-SSe (Fig. 2B). According to the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) calculation, the optical bandgaps were 1.87, 1.74 and 1.63 eV for DPP-SO, DPP-SS and DPP-SSe (Fig. 2C), respectively, which further showed that S and Se caused a red-shift of the absorption wavelength.36 In addition, with the increase in atomic radius, absorption coefficients of 66.51, 62.14 and 49.21 L g−1 cm−1 for DPP-SO, DPP-SS and DPP-SSe, respectively, were revealed at 808 nm, which implied that DPP-SO had the best photothermal effect at 808 nm due to its excellent light-capture ability.

Photophysical properties of CPNs
To make CPs more suitable for photoacoustic and photothermal therapy, CPNs were prepared via a nanoprecipitation method (Fig. 3A). Here, the PEG shell effectively endowed on the CPNs provided a useful method for achieving a relatively safe and longer circulation time for the delivery of conjugated polymer nanoparticles to a tumour via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.19 As shown in Fig. 3C and Fig. S2 in the ESI,† the morphology and size distribution of these CPNs were characterized by TEM and DLS, showing that these CPNs had a uniform spherical morphology with an average hydrodynamic diameter of 70 nm. The solutions of CPNs were still clear and transparent in PBS after being stored at 4 °C for one month, suggesting the better dispersibility of these CPNs (Fig. S3 in ESI†).

The UV-vis-NIR absorption of these CPNs dispersion solutions in water was further investigated (Fig. 3B), and the three CPNs had obvious NIR-absorbing properties in the range of 600–1050 nm. Then, 808 nm light was used to examine the photothermal performance of these CPNs at varied concentrations and laser powers. The temperature changes of these CPNs displayed obvious concentration and laser power dependence within 5 min with 808 light (Fig. 3D, E and Fig. S4, S5, ESI†); and even after five heating and cooling cycles were carried out, the maximum temperature of these CPNs (15 μg mL−1) still maintained at the same level, indicating that the CPNs had excellent photostability (Fig. 3F and Fig. S6 in the ESI†). The photothermal conversion efficiencies of DPP-SO, DPP-SS and DPP-SSe NPs were up to 79.3%, 72.1% and 67.6%, respectively (Fig. 3G and Fig. S7 in the ESI†), which were higher than both most inorganic and organic materials such as AuNPs and polypyrrole,37,38 showing that the atomic doping of chalcogen has a powerful impact on the electron transfer and light-capture ability.39 Compared to the other two CPNs, the higher mass extinction coefficient and photothermal conversion efficiency of DPP-SO NPs indicated that these had the best photothermal performance.
Cell interactions
As the excellent photothermal properties of CPNs had aroused our enthusiasm, we assessed the in vitro photothermal elimination of cancer cells by CCK-8 assay to further test their excellent photothermal killing effect. The in vitro results showed that DPP-SO, DPP-SS and DPP-SSe NPs had negligible cell cytotoxicity without laser irradiation, but once an 808 nm laser was used to provide irradiation, these nanoparticles showed a high photothermal killing effect on tumour cells (Fig. 4A). The IC50 values of DPP-SO, DPP-SS and DPP-SSe NPs were calculated to be 4.78, 9.29 and 10.59 μg mL−1, respectively, suggesting the best PTT performance of DPP-SO NPs in A549 cells. Also, results on a human small cell lung cancer cell (H446) assay also confirmed that DPP-SO NPs had the best photothermal ablation effects (Fig. S8 in ESI†).

(B) Fluorescence images of A549 cells stained with calcein AM (green fluorescence represents live cells) and PI (red fluorescence represents dead cells) and scale bar is 50 μm. (C) Flow cytometry analysis of A549 cells stained with Annexin VFITC and PI. 
We further explored the tumour elimination ability of DPP-SO by calcein-AM and PI staining. As shown in Fig. 4B, the A549 cells treated with DPP-SO NPs exhibited a complete view of red fluorescence (red fluorescence represents dead cells stained with PI and green fluorescence represents live cells stained with calcein-AM) in the presence of 808 nm irradiation, which showed the remarkable photothermal therapy of DPP-SO NPs on tumour cells. By contrast, PBS, the laser and DPP-SO groups were completely dyed with green fluorescence, which validated the biosafety of the DPP-SO NPs in the dark. Next, the mechanism of the photothermal killing of the cells was further explored by flow cytometry. Fig. 4C shows that 67% of the cells treated with DPP-SO NPs plus laser irradiation had died, strongly indicating that a dramatic therapeutic effect and apoptosis was the most likely pathway for A549 cells’ death.
In addition, the biocompatibility of nanoparticles is vital, and here, haemolytic tests of the DPP-SO NPs were performed (Fig. S9 in ESI†). The different concentrations of DPP-SO NPs were detected, and when the concentration of DPP-SO NPs reached 1000 μg mL−1, the red blood cells still did not show haemolysis. In vitro cytotoxicity and haemolysis experiments confirmed the good biocompatibility of DPP-SO NPs, and so further biological research was carried out.

In vivo PPT therapy of DPP-SO NPs
Spurred on by these exciting in vitro results, we further estimated the anti-tumour efficiency of DPP-SO NPs in vivo guided by photoacoustic (PA) imaging. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, the DPP-SO NPs exhibited obvious concentration-dependent PA signal with a good positively linear relation under 808 nm excitation, illustrating their high performance as a PA agent. Notably, as shown in Fig. 5C and D, the DPP-SO NPs (1 mg mL−1) gradually accumulated at the tumour at 9 h according to the PA intensity due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Under the guidance of PA imaging, we performed the in vivo photothermal therapy of DPP-SO NPs. Here, DPP-SO NPs (100 μL, 1 mg mL−1) were injected via the caudal vein, and the DPP-SO NPs were exposed to 808 nm laser irradiation for 5 min after 9 h. The temperature of the tumour region rapidly increased to 65 °C after laser irradiation, while the temperature change of the PBS group was negligible under the same conditions (Fig. 5E), showing that DPP-SO NPs had an excellent photothermal effect in the tumour area of the mice. The mice were observed and recorded for 16 days, comparing with the PBS, Laser and DPP-SO groups, as shown in Fig. 5F–H, where it could be seen that the tumour became smaller or even disappeared in the DPP-SO NPs plus laser irradiation group, implying the DPP-SO NPs have huge potential to inhibit tumours. Moreover, during the treatment, there was no significant difference in the body weight of the mice among the different groups (Fig. S10 in ESI†), showing the marvellous biological safety of the DPP-SO NPs. Standard haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the major organs further showed that DPP-SO caused no significant inflammatory lesions or damage to the mice (Fig. 6B). To further verify the photothermal therapeutic effects, H&E staining and a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay were used to stain the tumour tissue. Compared with the other groups (Fig. 6B), there were more nucleus dissociation in the tumour sections in the H&E staining for the DPP-SO NPs + laser group, suggesting that the necrosis and apoptosis of cancer cells were triggered by PTT. Similarly, tumour sections stained with TUNEL showed bright green fluorescence, implying an obvious apoptosis of cancer cells.40 All the above results further confirmed the excellent PTT effect of the DPP-SO NPs.

Finally, the biological safety of the DPP-SO NPs was further evaluated with biochemical and blood routine analysis. The blood items, including PDW, MPV and MCV, were examined, and remarkable differences between the treatment and control groups were not found (Fig. 6A). Similarly, there was also no significant difference in the biochemical items, such as ALT, AST, BUN and CK (Fig. 6A). Overall, these preliminary results confirmed that the toxicity of the DPP-SO NPs was negligible within a certain amount of dosage.
Conclusions
In conclusion, via a molecular engineering approach, we designed and synthesized three DPP-conjugated polymers with heteroatom substitution of the thiophene moiety. The experimental results in vitro showed that the DPP nanoparticles had exceptional PTT/PA performance in vitro. The resulting DPP-SO NPs showed a high photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 79.3%, demonstrating their excellent photothermal therapy property. It is proclaimed that heteroatom substitution in the DPP-conjugated polymers with the change from O to S to Se could apparently adjust the absorption spectrum and energy gap of the DPP-conjugated polymers to obtain the most suitable PTAs for use in biomedicine. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed DPP-SO NPs’ anti-tumour efficacy and biosafety with precise imaging guidance. This work provides a novel and simple method for constructing photothermal transduction agents to improve therapeutic performance and offers an important step forward for developing effective PTAs.
