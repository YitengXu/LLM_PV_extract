The ratio of α-Fe2O3:TiO2 in the α-Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites can be tuned by etching the α-Fe2O3 core via controlling the concentration of HCl and etching time. An appropriate concentration of the Fe2O3 core could effectively induce a transition of the optical response from the UV to the visible region and decrease the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and the holes of the core–shell structured catalyst, greatly contributing to the enhancement of visible light response and visible light photocatalytic activity of the Fe2O3@TiO2 catalysts. It is revealed that the optical response and photocatalytic performance of the core–shell α-Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposites can be tuned by adjusting the molar ratio of Fe2O3:TiO2 of the α-Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposites. The α-Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposite with an optimal molar ratio of 7% for Fe2O3:TiO2 exhibits the best photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation. It is shown that the Fe2O3/TiO2 heterojunction structure is responsible for the efficient visible-light photocatalytic activity. As the concentration of Fe2O3 is high, Fe3+ ions will act as recombination centres of the photogenerated electrons and holes. The present core–shell Fe2O3@TiO2 nanoparticles displaying enhanced photodegradation activity could find potential applications as photocatalysts for the abatement of various organic pollutants.1. IntroductionTiO2 is a common choice for photocatalyst candidates due to not only its photocatalytic attributes but also its low cost and benign nature.1 Since Fujishima and Honda discovered photocatalytic water-splitting behavior of crystalline TiO2 electrodes for hydrogen production in 1972,2 much attention on TiO2 photocatalysis has grown significantly owing to its strong oxidizing power under ultraviolet (UV) light, extraordinary chemical stability, and environmentally friendly nature. A problem affecting the application of TiO2 as a photocatalyst is that the optical response of TiO2 is mostly determined by its underlying electronic structure, TiO2 is active only under near-ultraviolet irradiation and no visible light response can be obtained due to its wide band gap energy of 3.0–3.2 eV.3 From the viewpoint of utilizing solar light, visible light responsive TiO2-based photocatalysts are highly desired. One of the potential solutions for improving the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2 in the visible region is to shift its optical absorption from the UV region to the visible-light region, allowing for more photons to be absorbed and utilized in decomposing the pollutants. It has been widely recognized that the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions of TiO2 materials can be enhanced via doping substantially owing to modification of their band-gap energy structures and introduction of dopant energy states.4To further improve the photocatalytic performance of TiO2 catalysts, the photogenerated electrons and holes must be separated into different locations on the catalyst. The decrease of the recombination rate of the photogenerated electrons and holes and improvement of the visible light response of TiO2 can be achieved by preparing heterojunctions or nanocomposites that can induce the transition of the optical response from the UV to the visible region, and separate the electrons and the holes into two different regions of the catalyst.5–8 Structural and compositional architecture of core–shell nanocomposites has received significant research attention in recent years due to their importance in the fields of energy storage and conversion, composite catalysts, dye-sensitized solar cells, and gas sensing.9–17Because the ratio of core to shell materials can be modified by changing the constituent of the core or shell, the core–shell nanoparticles display a variety of properties depending on the structure and chemical composition of constituents.13,14 There have been a great number of synthetic strategies to compound core–shell structures, like solution-based synthesis, interfacial crystal growth, polymerization, and direct heteroepitaxial deposition on different hard templates.1–11Inspiringly, metal oxide core–shell architecture nanocomposites offer a potential solution as a result of the synergy that is possible among the components. TiO2 based photocatalytic heterostructures such as noble metal/TiO2,5 carbon/TiO2,18 metal oxide/TiO2,19 and metal chalcogenide/TiO220 have been proposed and studied. The previously reported TiO2 based nanocomposites display a greatly enhanced photocatalytic performance in organic pollutant degradation in the visible light region. Alpha-iron oxide (α-Fe2O3), one of the stable forms of iron oxide under ambient conditions, is a promising material for catalysis and gas sensors21–25 because of its stability, favorable band gap, abundance, and low cost. The combination of TiO2 with Fe2O3 to form a core–shell structured nanocomposite can decrease the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes. Furthermore, the core–shell structured Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposites can be used to improve the visible light response of TiO2.In this article, we report on the heteroepitaxial growth route using the monodisperse α-Fe2O3 spindles that act as hard templates to form core–shell structured Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposites. The core–shell structured Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposites with a controllable phase constituent of core and shell sections display tunable optical response and photocatalytic activity. The α-Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposite with an optimal molar ratio of 7% for Fe2O3:TiO2 exhibits the best photocatalytic performance under visible and UV light irradiation. The photocatalytic degradation mechanism on RhB of core–shell structured Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposites was investigated. The present core–shell Fe2O3@TiO2 nanoparticles displaying enhanced photodegradation activity could find potential applications as photocatalysts for the abatement of various organic pollutants.2. Experimental section2.1 Materials synthesisThe α-Fe2O3 spindles were fabricated by aging a solution of 0.02 M FeCl3 and 0.2 mM NaH2PO4 at 105 °C for 50 h.26 The 0.2 M TiF4 solution was prepared by dissolving titanium powder in hydrofluoric acid and aging for several days. For a typical synthesis of α-Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles (route 1), 35 mg of α-Fe2O3 spindles was first dispersed by ultrasonication in a mixture solution with 138 mL of ethanol and 20 mL of PVP (Aldrich, K-30) solution (9.75 mg mL−1) in deionized water, then 25 mL of TiF4 (0.04 M) solution was added and aged for more than 1 h. After that, the suspension was delivered into two 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclaves, which were then maintained at 180 °C for 3 h in an electric oven. After the autoclaves were cooled to room temperature naturally, the product was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water several times, ultimately drying at 60 °C overnight. The products were denoted as α-Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles.The as-prepared α-Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell particles were treated with different routes. The particles were etched with 0.2 M HCl solution at 100 °C for 24 h (route 2), 1 M HCl solution at 100 °C for 24 h (route 3), and 0.2 M HCl solution at 100 °C for 48 h (route 4), respectively. The corresponding treated-samples were denoted as 0.2 M/24 h, 1 M/24 h, 0.2 M/48 h. The TiO2 is synthesized by route 1 in the absence of hematite α-Fe2O3 spindle templates (Scheme 1). Scheme 1  The synthesis route of α-Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanoparticles and the subsequent etching process. 2.2 CharacterizationThe purity and phase structure of materials were characterized by a Rigaku model Ru-200b X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD). The morphologies were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (JEM-2100, 200 kV) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, SU-70). UV/visible diffuse-reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded on a Cary-500 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer in which BaSO4 powder was used as the internal standard to obtain the optical properties of the samples over a wavelength range of 200–800 nm.2.3 Photodegradation reactionsThe photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated by the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) in an aqueous solution under the irradiation of both ultraviolet (UV) light and sunlight. The reactions were conducted at ambient temperature and pressure. The 300 W Hg lamp and 350 W Xe lamp were used as the UV light and the visible light source, respectively, to trigger the photocatalytic reactions. Typically, the aqueous RhB–catalyst suspension system was prepared as follows. A 5 mg sample of the catalyst was dispersed in 50 mL aqueous solution containing RhB dye (C0 = 10 mg L−1). The mixture was stirred for 10 min in the dark to achieve the equilibrium of adsorption–desorption before the irradiation. The suspension was magnetically stirred before and during the illumination. During the experiment, 6 mL sample solution was drawn from the system at certain time intervals. After centrifugation, the residual concentration of RhB was detected at 554 nm, using a Varian UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary-50 Varian Co.) based on Lambert–Beer's law. The percentage of degradation is indicated as C/C0. Here, C is the concentration of RhB solution at each irradiation time interval, and C0 is the initial concentration when the adsorption–desorption equilibrium was achieved.3. Results and discussionThe morphology and crystallographic structure of the as-prepared products were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The FESEM image in Fig. 1a shows that the synthesized product was composed of uniformly dispersed spindle particles with about 400 nm in length and 50 nm in width. It is indicated that yield of the products is high, and the size and morphology are uniformly distributed. The XRD pattern of the synthesized products is shown in Fig. 1b. All of the diffraction peaks could be unambiguously indexed to the rhombohedral α-Fe2O3 according to JCPDS card No. 33-0664, with a space group of Rc and lattice parameters of a = 5.035 Å and c = 13.75 Å. No other diffraction peaks were detected, indicating the high purity of the product. Fig. 1  (a) The FESEM image and (b) XRD pattern of the as-prepared Fe2O3 nanocomposites. The XRD patterns of the as-prepared and etched core–shell Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposite samples in HCl solution are shown in Fig. 2. They suggest that all of the diffraction peaks could be in good agreement with that of the anatase TiO2 phase with lattice constants a = 3.785 Å and c = 9.513 Å (JCPDS No. 21-1272), rhombohedral α-Fe2O3 with a space group of Rc and lattice parameters of a = 5.035 Å and c = 13.75 Å. It is shown that with the concentration of HCl solution and etching time increasing, the peaks related to the α-Fe2O3 phase get more and more weak, suggesting that the content of the Fe2O3 core gradually decreases. It is noted that after 24 hours of etching in a 1 M HCl solution, the XRD peak related Fe2O3 phase almost disappears. Fig. 2  The XRD patterns of the as-prepared Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites and the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell samples etched in different concentrations of HCl solution for different etching times. The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared core–shell Fe2O3@TiO2 samples are examined in a FESEM and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Fig. 3a shows a FESEM image of as-prepared core–shell Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposites, displaying uniform spindle-like particles. As shown in the low-magnification TEM image in Fig. 3b, the core–shell structural nature for the synthesized products can be determined, which are composed of a well-defined shell of self-organized TiO2 and a spindle-like Fe2O3 core (Fe2O3 is completely encapsulated within the TiO2 shell). The length of the core–shell nanoparticles is about 400 nm and the polycrystalline TiO2 shell is relatively uniform with a thickness of around 50 nm. A magnified TEM image in Fig. 3c clearly indicates the core–shell structure of the Fe2O3@TiO2 samples. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3d) reveals that the core–shell nanoparticles contain anatase TiO2 and hematite Fe2O3, which is consistent with the results of XRD patterns. The (101), (004), (200) rings correspond well to that of anatase TiO2, while the (110), (104), (116) rings match well to that of rhombohedral α-Fe2O3. Fig. 3  (a) The FESEM and (b–c) TEM images of the as-prepared Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites. (d) Selected area electron diffraction pattern suggests the products are composed of Fe2O3 and TiO2 phases, the diffraction rings correspond well to (101), (004), (200) planes of anatase TiO2, and (110), (104), (116) planes of rhombohedral α-Fe2O3. The microstructures of the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites etched in a 0.2 M HCl solution at different times are shown in Fig. 4. A typical FESEM image in Fig. 4a shows the morphology of the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites etched in 0.2 M HCl for 24 h. Under the relatively mild etching conditions, the sample could still maintain the configuration of Fe2O3@TiO2 (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4b–d depicts FESEM and TEM images of the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites etched in 0.2 M HCl for 48 h. It is shown that the polycrystalline TiO2 shell is robust enough to survive when the etching time is up to 48 h. After 48 h of etching in 0.2 M HCl, the size of the Fe2O3 core within the TiO2 shell gets smaller. Fig. 4e is the SAED pattern for the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites etched in 0.2 M HCl for 48 h, the (101), (004), (200) rings correspond well to that of anatase TiO2, while the (110), (104), (116) rings match well to that of rhombohedral α-Fe2O3. A typical EDS spectrum for the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposite etched in 0.2 M HCl for 48 h shown in Fig. 4d shows that the presence of Ti, Fe, and O elements in the etched core–shell samples, and the molar ratio for Fe2O3:TiO2 is about 7.0%.

(b)–(d) 0.2 M HCl at 100 °C for 48 h. (e) electron diffraction pattern. (f) EDS spectrum. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to measure the UV-vis reflectance of the core–shell structured Fe2O3@TiO2 samples before and after the etching treatment process. Fig. 5a shows the diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of TiO2, Fe2O3 and different Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposite samples etched at different concentrations of HCl for different times. It is interesting to observe that the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites are more responsible to visible light, which can be primarily ascribed to electron transfer promotion from the valence band of Fe2O3 to the conduction band of TiO2. The band gap energy of the core–shell nanocomposites can be confirmed by roughly comparing to the plot in Fig. 5b, which is obtained via the transformation based on the Kubelka–Munk function (F(R∞) = (1 − R)2/(2R), where R = reflectance with the reflectance at 1000 nm set at 100%).27,28 Fig. 5  (a) The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites. (b) The plot of transformed Kubelka–Munk function versus the energy of light. The estimated band gap value of TiO2, Fe2O3 and Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposites etched under the conditions of 0.2 M/24 h, 0.2 M/48 h and 1 M/24 h corresponds approximately to the light response with a band gap energy of 1.87, 3.20, 1.90, 1.94, 2.08 and 2.48 eV, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the transition of light response from UV to visible light of the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposite samples can be realized by controlling the content of the Fe2O3 core. It is obvious that the optical properties of the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites can be tuned by adjusting the molar ratio of Fe2O3:TiO2via etching the Fe2O3 core by controlling the etching concentration of HCl and etching time.The photocatalytic activity of the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites was evaluated by degradation of the aqueous Rhodamine B (RhB) solution under visible and UV light irradiation. Fig. 6a illustrates the photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB under the visible light irradiation over the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites and TiO2 (see Fig. S3, ESI† for the photocatalytic activity of bare Fe2O3). It is clearly seen that the photocatalytic performance of the Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposites can be tuned via controlling the etching time and the concentration of HCl. Among all of the samples, the core–shell Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposite etched for 48 h in 0.2 M HCl, with a corresponding optimized molar ratio of 7% for Fe2O3:TiO2, displays the best photocatalytic activity toward the degradation of RhB under the visible light illumination. Under visible light irradiation, RhB can be degraded over 60% within 5 hours under the visible light irradiation in the presence of 7% Fe2O3–TiO2 nanocomposites. The photocatalytic activity of the core–shell Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposite etched for 48 h in 0.2 M HCl is greatly improved compared with the unetched Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposite sample (only 10% RhB can be degraded for the unetched Fe2O3@TiO2 sample). Both the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites etched under the etching conditions of 0.2 M/24 h and 1 M/24 h show enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to the unetched Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposite. It should be noted that the photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation of all the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites is superior to that of bare Fe2O3 and pure TiO2. According to previous studies,29–31 the degradation of dyes can be ascribed to a pseudo-first-order reaction with a simplified Langmuir–Hinshelwood model when C0 is very small: ln(C0/C) = kt, where k is the apparent first-order rate constant. As displayed in Fig. 6b, the core–shell nanocomposite etched under the conditions of 0.2 M/48 h displays the highest rate constant (ca. 0.1605 h−1) among all the samples. The photocatalytic activity and the kinetic rate constants of the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites under different etching conditions follow the order: 0.2 M/48 h > 0.2 M/24 h > 1 M/24 h > Fe2O3@TiO2 > bare Fe2O3 > pure TiO2. Fig. 6  Performance of Fe2O3@TiO2 core–hell nanocomposites and other samples for photocatalytic degradation of RhB under irradiation of visible light. The photocatalytic activity for the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites was also evaluated under the irradiation of UV light, as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S4, ESI.† The similar behavior of photocatalytic activity under UV light irradiation for the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites can be observed compared to the photocatalysis performance under visible light irradiation. The Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell sample etched in 0.2 M HCl for 48 h exhibits the best degradation rate up to 65%, greatly exceeding that of the unetched Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposite sample. The kinetic rate constants of the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites under different etching conditions follow the order: 0.2 M/48 h > 0.2 M/24 h > 1 M/24 h > Fe2O3@TiO2 > bare Fe2O3. Fig. 7  Performance of Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites and other samples for photocatalytic degradation of RhB under irradiation of UV light. It is shown that the appropriate etching treatment of Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites can greatly improve the performance of photocatalytic degradation of the RhB dye. The Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell sample with a molar ratio of 7% for Fe2O3:TiO2 exhibits the best photocatalytic activity under both the visible and UV light irradiation. The optical results indicate that the existence of the coupling Fe2O3 is associated with narrowing of band gap energy and shifting of the absorption response to the visible region, resulting in an enhancement of photocatalytic reactivity of the core–shell nanocomposites in the visible region. However, for the as-prepared Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites without any subsequent etching process, it is revealed that an excess of Fe2O3 may reduce the photocatalytic activity of the composites. It is should be noted that the optical property and photocatalytic activity of the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites can be tuned by changing the content of the Fe2O3 core section.The activity of photocatalytic degradation reaction depends on many factors, such as the adsorption of dye on the catalyst surface, band-gap energy, surface area, particle size, crystallinity, and electron–hole recombination rate.29,31–33 For the presently synthesized Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites, the photocatalytic activity under visible and UV light irradiation is mainly dependent on band-gap structure and the relationship between the fast recombination rate of charge carriers in comparison with the reactions decomposing the hazardous dye.34–40 Generally, when Fe2O3 nanoparticles were coupled to the surface of TiO2, the Fermi level of TiO2 and Fe2O3 must align in equilibrium due to the presence of the Fe2O3/TiO2 heterojunction.34,41,42Under the visible light irradiation, TiO2 cannot be excited to generate electron–hole pairs, whereas Fe2O3 could be easily activated and yield charge carriers, as shown in Scheme 2I. Subsequently, the photogenerated electrons immigrate from the conduction band of Fe2O3 to the conduction band of TiO2 under the action of built-in electric field and the concentration gradient activated and yielded charge carriers, while photogenerated holes accumulated in the valence band of Fe2O3.38,40,43 The negative electrons in the valence band of TiO2 will further react with molecular oxygen O2 dissolved in the RhB solution to form the superoxide anion O2− and hydrogen peroxide H2O2. While the accumulated holes in the valence band of Fe2O3 will react with OH− species existing on the surface of the catalyst, producing reactive hydroxyl radicals (˙OH).34,38,40 The reactions can be described as follows:Fe3+ + hν → Fe2+ + Fe4+ + (hvb+ + ecb−)Ti4+ + ecb− → Ti3+ecb− (Ti3+) + O2 → O2−hvb+ (Fe4+) + OH− → ˙OH Scheme 2  Suggested electronic transition between TiO2 and Fe2O3 under visible and UV light irradiation. As the concentration of Fe2O3 is high in the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposite, the recombination reaction becomes predominant and Fe3+ ions will become recombination centers for electrons and holes:Fe2+ + e− → Fe3+Fe4+ + e− → Fe3+Fe2+ + ˙OH → Fe3+ + OH−Fe4+ + Ti3+ → Fe3+ + Ti4+However, under the irradiation of UV light, electron–hole pairs are produced in the conduction and valence bands of TiO2, a heterojunction is formed between Fe2O3 and TiO2 becomes normal,34,41,42 the Fe2O3 would act as recombination centers of the photogenerated electrons and holes, as illustrated in Scheme 2II. Fe2O3 will absorb most of the electromagnetic irradiation and promote favorable conditions for the presence of hole–electron recombination centers,34,43 so that Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites exhibit a poor photocatalytic activity.It also should be noticed that the acid etching of core–shell composites may make the surface of TiO2 rough and improve the photoactivity of TiO2-based materials.44–46 As the content of Fe2O3 decreases, the performance of other samples is improved except that of 1 M/24 h. It is possibly because the structure of the sample was destroyed under the treatment, (see Fig. S1, ESI†) which may imply that the core–shell structure turns to hollow core–shell architecture after the acid etching, not only increasing the inner surface area, but also acting as the hollow reaction container for photodegradation dye.4. ConclusionsIn summary, the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites have been fabricated via a facile hydrothermal reaction route. The ratio of α-Fe2O3:TiO2 in the α-Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites was tuned by etching the α-Fe2O3 core with dilute hydrochloric acid. An appropriate concentration of the Fe2O3 core could contribute to the enhancement of visible light response and visible light photocatalytic activity of the Fe2O3@TiO2 catalysts. Photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) in the liquid phase was used to evaluate the activity of the Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposites systematically. It is revealed that the optical response and photocatalytic performance of the core–shell α-Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposites can be tuned by adjusting the molar ratio of Fe2O3:TiO2 of the α-Fe2O3@TiO2 nanocomposites. The α-Fe2O3@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposite with an optimal molar ratio of 7% for Fe2O3:TiO2 exhibits the best photocatalytic performance under the visible light. It is shown that the Fe2O3–TiO2 heterojunction structure is responsible for the efficient visible-light photocatalytic activity. As the concentration of Fe2O3 is high or under the UV light irradiation, Fe3+ ions will act as recombination centers and impose negative impact on the degradation of RhB.AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge support from the National Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars (No. 51025211), The National Basic Research Program (No. 2013CB934303), National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 51272137), and the Tai Shan Scholar Foundation of Shandong Province.ReferencesK.
