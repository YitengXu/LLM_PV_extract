    , Accepted 18th February 2023First published on 20th February 2023AbstractA series of pyrenyl and halogenated chalcone (PyBr and PyF) derivatives with different substituent groups have been constructed in this work for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications. The compounds were synthesized using the Claisen–Schmidt condensation reaction and single crystals were successfully attained via the slow evaporation method. The existence of intermolecular interactions (C–H⋯O, C–H⋯π and π⋯π) in crystal packing was found to stabilize the crystal structure and enhance charge transfer within the molecules. UV-Vis analysis was conducted with the acetonitrile solvent to obtain the energy gap values of PyBr and PyF, which were particularly in the range suitable for photosensitizer materials used in DSSC (2.74 and 2.78 eV). The proposed compounds are situated in the appropriate HOMO and LUMO energy levels, confirming their suitability as dye sensitizer materials. Further, all compounds were investigated for solar cell performance. The fabrication of the DSSC layers was carried out and characterization using the FESEM-EDX analysis revealed the surface morphology and elemental composition of the compounds on the TiO2 layer. Owing to the D–π–A architecture and planar structure of PyBr, the compound showed an improved performance in DSSC compared with the twisted structure of PyF with the additional methoxy group.
1. Introduction
The global energy demand is growing fast due to the increasing population-led consumption of resources, such as crude oil and natural gas. As a country that receives sunlight throughout the year, using photovoltaic technology in Malaysia is a great strategy toward producing potential renewable energy. The solar cell is a photovoltaic technology discovered in the 1950s to convert sunlight into electrical energy.1 Since its discovery, the solar cell has become a promising candidate for research and has led to the development of three generations of these devices over time using multiple fabrication materials. The first (1st) generation of solar cells focused on pure silicon crystals, producing silicon-based solar cells, which successfully dominated the photovoltaic market with high efficiencies.2 Moreover, the second (2nd) generation was based on thin-film technologies that offered a lower cost than the first-generation cell.3,4 The third (3rd)-generation solar cells are currently gaining much attention due to their unique property of photogenerated charges.
In recent years, dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), a third-generation solar cell, has been growing rapidly due to its ability to achieve higher efficiency with simple fabrication and eco-friendly methods compared with conventional cells.5 The basic structure of DSSC consists of three key components, including a dye-sensitized photoanode, a counter electrode, and a redox electrolyte. Compared with other solar-cell generations, DSSCs make use of a dye sensitizer as the key material to achieve high performance instead of p–n junctions.6 The important criterion for a dye to be a sensitizer in DSSCs is that it must be well absorbed onto the TiO2 layer.7 Thus, the study on the best material for dye sensitization should be augmented to facilitate electron transfer in the DSSC and hence its conversion efficiency.
Chalcone is an established π-conjugated system, which is widely applied as a part of DSSC materials. During the past few years, chalcone, which is also recognized as 1,3-diarylprop-2-en-1-one, has been used as the main component in numerous natural products since it is abundantly found in edible plants and also acts as a precursor of flavonoids and isoflavonoids.8 The structure of the chalcone is represented by dual aromatic groups connected by an enone linkage present in a class of aromatic ketones.9 Chalcones are characterized by a planar π-conjugated property, which refers to the system with alternate single and double bonds along the carbon chain.10 According to previous research, the existence of a π-conjugated configuration promotes charge transfer throughout the compound.11 Thus far, π-conjugated chalcones have been widely explored not only in the DSSC industry but also in light-emitting diodes (OLED) and non-linear optics (NLO).12 Besides, chalcone is an organic molecule that exhibits a push–pull property. The push–pull system is a desired property that delivers a structure with good intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) within the compound. Therefore, a push–pull system can be created by alternating the donor (D) and acceptor (A) anchoring part of the compound since it leads to different properties and results.13 A previous study has explained that good transmission of ICT contributes to a strong and bathochromic shift of the longest absorption maxima wavelength in the UV-Vis absorption spectrum.14 Thus, this proves the potential of chalcone as an excellent photovoltaic material candidate since it possesses a push–pull system, good transmission of ICT and a bathochromic shift in the absorption wavelength in the UV-Vis spectra, which lead to satisfactory cell efficiency.15
In fact, some researchers have discovered the potency of chalcone derivatives as potential dye sensitizers in DSSC applications.9,12,16–18 A study suggested that the different anchoring substituents in chalcone derivatives may vary the light-harvesting ability of the DSSC.9 For this purpose, Anizaim and co-workers12 synthesized a series of chalcone derivatives with different attachments in the structure. From the results, the group discovered the presence of bithiophene in the molecular structure results in a planar backbone, thus increasing the ICT and DSSC efficiency. Hence, this proves that the different attachments in the structural configuration of chalcones provide unique characteristics in photovoltaic studies.
In the framework of this study, two chalcone derivatives with halogenated atoms as attachments, specifically (E)-1-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(pyren-1-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (PyBr) and (E)-1-(3-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(pyren-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (PyF), are discussed as a continuation of our previous research.9PyBr and PyF were strategically designed by the attachment of polyaromatic pyrene derivatives as the donor groups at similar positions in the chalcone structure. Interestingly, a methoxy group (–OCH3) was introduced to the acceptor side of PyF as an additional donor, meanwhile, PyBr was constructed with a D–π–A architecture without any additional substitution. Both structures were designed to investigate their performance as dye sensitizers in DSSC applications herein.
2. Methodology
2.1. Synthesis of the PyBr and PyF chalcone derivatives
The synthesis process was performed using the Claisen–Schmidt condensation method,9,12,13,18 which involved the reaction of 0.3 mmol 1-pyrenecarboxaldehyde (99%) and 0.3 mmol 4′-bromoacetophenone (98%) (PyBr) or 3′-fluoro-4′-methoxyacetophenone (99%) (PyF) in 20 mL methanol solvent. The condensation process of PyBr and PyF was aided by sodium hydroxide (NaOH: 10 mmol, 0.4 g) as a catalyst to speed up the reaction. All chemicals were acquired from Merck and used without purification. The catalyst was dropped gradually into the solution while stirring until the precipitate was formed. The solutions were stirred at room temperature until the reaction was complete, which was confirmed by observing the thin layer chromatography (TLC) results. Once ready, the precipitate (percentage yield: 89.7% for PyBr and 60.9% for PyF) was filtered and dried for a few days. For the recrystallization process, a sufficient amount of each precipitate was spooned into vials. Recrystallization was performed using the slow-evaporation method in acetone solvent. The solutions were left to dry until crystals were formed. Scheme 1 shows the synthetic route of PyBr and PyF.

2.2. Spectroscopic analyses
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) was conducted using the solid-form samples on a PerkinElmer GX Frontier Spectrophotometer. The ATR machine was equipped with a diamond crystal accessory to compress the sample. The IR spectrum was recorded in the range of 600–4000 cm−1, and the data obtained were analysed using the PerkinElmer Spectrum software. Moreover, for NMR studies, the compounds (0.015 g) were freshly prepared by dissolving the precipitates in the DMSO-d6 solvent. Small vials containing the compounds and solvent were sonicated until the precipitates were fully dissolved. Once ready, the samples were tested using Bruker 500 and 125 MHz Avance III spectrometers for 1H and 13C NMR analyses, respectively. Next, the UV-Vis spectroscopy study was performed by utilizing the UV-Visible Spectrophotometer Model Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR within the 200–800 nm spectral region at a concentration of 10−4 mol L−1 in acetonitrile solution.
2.3. X-ray crystallography study
X-ray crystallography was performed using a Bruker SMART APEX II Duo CCD area-detector diffractometer by utilizing MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) for both single crystals. A clean and clear crystal with no significant multiple crystals was selected for each compound under the microscope and used for data collection. The data collection strategy was calculated by the APEX II software package,19 while the cell refinement and data reduction processes were accomplished using the SAINT program.19 Then, the SHELXTL software package was utilized for solving and refining the single crystal X-ray diffraction data.20 The SADABS program was applied for the process of absorption correction of the final crystal data.19 Torsional angles, dihedral angles, ring conformation and hydrogen bonds were calculated using PLATON software.21 Meanwhile, the molecular graphic was generated using SHELXTL20 and MERCURY22 programs. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. All hydrogen atoms were positioned geometrically [C–H = 0.93–0.96 Å] and refined using the riding model based on Uiso (H) = 1.2Ueq (C) or 1.5Ueq (Cmethyl). PyF consists of a methyl group (–CH3), which was further applied for the rotating group model. The summary of the crystallographic data and related refinement parameters of PyBr and PyF are listed in Table 1.

2.4. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis
The groundwork for CV analysis (Fig. 1) began with the preparation of TiO2 on glass for each sample.16,23,24 The designated TiO2 on glass was immersed in the dye solution, which was prepared by dissolving 10−2 M of the precipitate in 5 mL of acetonitrile overnight for both compounds. Then, the remaining dye solution was dropped onto the TiO2 area using the drop-casting technique with the presence of hot airflow to dry the sample. Next, the electrolyte solution was prepared by dissolving 0.2 M of sodium sulfate, Na2SO4 in 100 mL of distilled water. Finally, the sample was further analysed by cyclic voltammetry using a Gamry Interface 1000 Potentiostat device with three electrodes: platinum (Pt) as the counter electrode (Fig. 1(a)), a reference electrode (Fig. 1(b)), and the sample as the working electrode (Fig. 1(c)). The analysis was repeated three times cyclically in the voltage range from −1.0 V to 1.0 V at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1.

2.5. Characterization and performance study of the DSSC
In this study, the DSSC was prepared by following a previously described fabrication method.9,12,18 A full set of DSSC kits was purchased from Solaronix for the fabrication process.

            PyBr and PyF as organic dye sensitizers. 
The organic dye sensitizers were prepared by dissolving 10−2 M of the precipitate into 5 mL of acetonitrile for each compound. A small amount of chenodeoxycholic acid (ratio 10:1) was added to the dye solution as a co-additive to enhance DSSC conversion.25 All steps were performed in the presence of minimal light to preserve the properties of the dye sensitizers.


II. The fabrication process and characterization of the DSSC. 
For the fabrication of the DSSC, a working electrode composed of TiO2 (6 mm × 6 mm) coated with FTO glass was sensitized by immersing it into the respective dye solution of PyBr and PyF overnight. Once ready, the samples were rinsed using the residual acetonitrile to extract the excess dye, and the remaining dye solution was dropped onto the TiO2 area using the drop-casting method and dried under hot airflow.25 The sensitized working electrode was characterized by FESEM and EDX analysis using an FEI Nova NanoSEM 450 scanning electron microscope. After this, the photoanode and counter electrode were attached by placing a sealing film made of Meltonix 1170 with a thickness of 60 μm between the electrodes to form a sandwich-type cell. The cell was again placed on a hot plate in order to melt the film via gradual application of pressure.18 The iodolyte AN-50 electrolyte solution was injected into both sandwich cells through a predrilled hole located at the surface of the counter electrode. Then, the holes were covered by sealing films to prevent the electrolyte from being leaked and the dyes from drying out. The fabrication process formed a sandwich-type cell as seen in the schematic of DSSC in Fig. 2.

Then, the sensitized cells of PyBr and PyF were analysed by a Keithley 2400 solar simulator to determine the output voltage and current reading of the tested compounds, under the irradiation of AM 1.5 simulated sunlight (CHF-XM-500 W) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic studies
In the FTIR analysis, the study of vibrational spectra provides information about the functional groups, bonding type, and molecular conformation of the compounds.26 The FTIR absorbance spectra were recorded in the 600–4000 cm−1 region. The vibrational spectra of PyBr and PyF were recorded, and the FTIR spectra are shown in Fig. S1 in ESI.† In this study, four vibrational regions of different functional groups, namely vC–H, vCO, vCC and vC–X [X = F and Br] were highlighted, as shown in Table 2, for both compounds.

In the chalcone derivatives, the C–H stretching vibration band was found at around 3034 and 3326 cm−1 in form of multiple weak to moderate bands.27,28 Meanwhile, the C–H stretching modes of PyBr and PyF in this study appeared as weak absorption bands in the IR spectrum at 3043 and 3041 cm−1, respectively. This is similar to the previously reported C–H stretching band of pyrene-based chalcones, which appeared at 3041 cm−1 as a weak-intensity band.23,29
Besides, PyF contains a methyl group (–CH3), which was confirmed by the stretching vibrations at 2961 cm−1. This vibrations mode agrees with the expected range of 2850–3000 cm−1 for symmetric and asymmetric C–H stretching.30 The blue shift of CH3 stretching is due to the attachment of the methyl group to the aromatic ring, which results in the hyperconjugative effect.30
According to a previous study, the peaks of CO stretching vibration can be identified in the range of 1600–1700 cm−1 for chalcone derivatives.31 Meanwhile, the corresponding peaks of PyBr and PyF were observed in the IR region 1650 and 1673 cm−1, respectively, which matches the reported literature.31 The detection of CO stretching vibrations in the spectrum indicated the formation of a carbonyl group (CO) in the conjugated enone bridge of the chalcone compound.32 The vibrational modes of CO stretching with pyrene substitution in the chalcone derivative showed strong IR absorption at 1587–1670 cm−1 due to the strong dipole moment caused by the partial positive charge of the carbon and the negative charge of the oxygen atom.32,33 Subsequently, the functional group C–O was identified in the spectrum of the PyF compound. The C–O vibrational mode of the compound was determined at 1226 cm−1, which lies within the expected region between 1100 cm−1 and 1300 cm−1.34
In chalcone derivatives, the characteristic band of CC stretching is usually observed at low frequencies with strong absorption characteristics around 1400 cm−1 but not exceeding 1625 cm−1 when conjugated with the carbonyl group.27 The stretching CC bands were obtained at 1575 and 1571 cm−1 in the IR spectra of PyBr and PyF, respectively, in good agreement with previous findings. The occurrence of this vibration is related to charge transfer between the pyrene donor group and the acceptor moieties, which initiate CC stretching and thus the formation of the peak.12
The attachment of heavy atoms to the phenyl ring influences the normal vibrational modes of the ring.33 C–X [X = F, Cl and Br] absorption can be observed in the wide range of 492–1234 cm−1 depending on the configuration and conformation of the compound.35 The presence of the C–F stretching mode has been previously stated in ref. 36 at 1000 cm−1 to 1250 cm−1 in the IR spectrum with medium to strong absorption peaks. The C–F stretching of the PyF compound showed absorption in the region around 1021 cm−1. As for C–Br stretching, the vibrational band range is 550 cm−1 to 1300 cm−1.37 The observed vibrational frequencies of C–Br stretching were within the expected region at 733 cm−1 in the IR spectra of the PyBr compound. Notably, the C–X stretching vibrations were difficult to recognize due to the overlap of vibrations between the phenyl ring bond and the heavy halogen atoms in the studied region.
3.2. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis
The NMR spectroscopy analysis is conducted to clarify the molecule structure of the compound in the organic chemistry field.38 In this study, the 1H and 13C spectra of PyBr and PyF were studied and are listed in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† Based on Fig. S2 (ESI†), the Hα protons of PyBr and PyF resonated as doublets at δ = 8.10 and 8.14 ppm in the spectra, respectively. Meanwhile, their corresponding Hβ was found at δ = 8.28 ppm (PyBr) and 8.48 ppm (PyF) as doublets in the 1H NMR spectra. The strong coupling constant characterizes trans coupling, which matches the trans configurations of Hα and Hβ in the molecular structure of PyBr and PyF.39
In organic compounds, the chemical shift of the 1H NMR peaks is directly affected by the electronic environment of the protons.40 As for the pyrene moiety, the chemical shift of 9 deshielded protons in the polycyclic hydrocarbons to the regions δ = 7.80–8.89 ppm and 8.18–8.90 in the spectra of PyBr and PyF, respectively, was observed in this study.
Furthermore, the aromatic substituent protons were found within the normal chemical shift range in both compounds (either in the upfield or downfield region). The chemical shift of the aromatic substituent protons is subject to the type of aromatic ring and the electronic effects of the substituent on the ring.12 In addition, the anchoring of a methyl group (–CH3) moves the resonance of the attached proton to the upfield region and lower frequency than that of the pyrene moiety due to its electron-donating properties.39 In PyF, the deshielded –OCH3 substituent group was found in the region around 3.99 ppm in the 1H spectrum.
Likewise, the deshielded carbonyl carbons (CO) of both reported compounds were found at 194.19 ppm (PyBr) and 194.28 ppm (PyF). These results are in good agreement with the literature41–43 that, generally, the chemical shift of CO is obtained in the δ = 189.44–195.95 ppm region. Meanwhile, the carbon atoms located at the enone bridge resulted in the characteristic Cα signals at 124.18 ppm (PyBr) and 123.06 ppm (PyF), meanwhile, the shifted Cβ peaks were found at 133.04 ppm (PyBr) and 135.46 (PyF). Moreover, the chemical shift of the carbon atoms of the aromatic rings was found in the normal range of δ = 113.95–154.99 ppm.
3.3. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy
In the UV-Vis study, the absorption of UV-visible light by a molecule causes the excitation of its electrons from lower to higher energy levels.44 Hence, the energy gap can be determined by analysing the wavelength of the spectrum. The energy gap arises as the electron requires a specific amount of energy for the transition from the valence band to the conduction band.45 In this study, the energy gap obtained for PyBr and PyF were 2.74 eV and 2.78 eV, respectively. The energy gap of both compounds was determined experimentally by estimation from the Tauc plots (E = hc/λcut-off), whereas, the tangent line extrapolation was drawn to determine the λmax. Particularly, the energy gaps demonstrated by PyBr and PyF were in the low range, which indicates their suitability as photosensitizers in DSSC applications.
The absorbance spectra of pyrenyl chalcones with different attachments presented multiple weak and sharp peaks due to the styryl-substituted pyrene character.46 In Fig. 3a and b, the λmax is obtained at 377 nm (PyBr) and 390 nm (PyF) for both compounds, respectively. The electronic absorption spectra (Fig. 3) showed that both studied compounds resulted in a low energy level, with a broad peak at 377 nm and 376 nm for PyBr and PyF, respectively. This phenomenon occurs due to the π–π* transition and push–pull system of the π-conjugated chalcone derivative.42

3.4. Molecular and crystal structure analyses
The single crystals of PyBr and PyF were successfully further subjected to single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The molecular structures of both single crystals are displayed in Fig. 4. PyBr crystallized in a monoclinic crystal system, meanwhile, PyF belonged to a triclinic crystal system. The molecular structures of PyBr and PyF adopted the s-cis configuration at the enone bridge (O1/C19–C17) with respect to the C19O1 and C17C18 bonds. According to the previously reported molecular structure,47 the s-cis configuration is the most stable conformation of chalcone derivatives.

Based on Table 4, the dihedral angle between the substituted aromatic ring and the enone bridge of PyBr was found to be planar at 7.58° due to the small impact of the para-substituted bromine (–Br) atom on the crystal structure. It was also observed that the bromobenzene ring also formed a small dihedral angle with the pyrene unit due to the weak influence of heavy atoms on molecular planarity, as displayed in Fig. 5. The dihedral angle observed in PyBr is comparable with the cited ref. 33 in Table 4, demonstrating the planar backbone of both structures. As for PyF, the structure showed a less-twisted configuration between the pyrene moiety and the substituted ring (16.80°) due to the presence of a heavy methoxy (–OCH3) group and fluoro (–F) substituent at the aromatic rings (Fig. 5). This was further confirmed by the small distorted dihedral angle (13.15°) between the substituted ring and the enone unit due to the existence of heavy atoms in this compound. The value obtained is comparable with the dihedral angle of 18.3° acquired in former research.48 In short, the structural configuration of PyBr was observed to be more planar compared with the configuration attained by PyF, as concluded from Table 4. Consequently, PyBr allows high ICT within the compound due to the planarity of the molecular structure.12

The intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions in PyBr and PyF are tabulated in Table 5. In the crystal packing of PyBr, the molecules were connected to form centrosymmetric dimers via intermolecular C–H⋯O interactions that form R22(18) loops, which are stacked along the b-axis (Fig. 6). The intermolecular C–H⋯O interactions are the most established in the crystal packing of chalcone molecular structures and help to further stabilize the crystal arrangement.9,12,18,33,48 Moreover, the intermolecular C–H⋯π interactions in the crystal packing involving the centroid Cg4; C8–C11/C15–C14 and Cg5; C20–C25 were also observed to stabilize the crystal structure (Fig. 6). These intermolecular C–H⋯O and C–H⋯π interactions further linked the molecules in a head-to-tail manner in the two-dimensional bc-plane.

On the other hand, three substantial interactions incorporated in the crystal packing of PyF were subjected to intermolecular C–H⋯O and π–π interactions. The intermolecular C–H⋯O interactions connected the molecules in a one-dimensional chain, resulting in the head-to-tail arrangement shown in Fig. 7(a). Alsaee and team published a similar structure comprised of C–H⋯O intermolecular interactions in a head-to-tail arrangement that supported the crystal structure.33 In addition, π–π interactions were observed in the crystal packing involving Cg2, Cg4, and Cg5, which represent the centroids of C1/C15/C11–C13/C16, C4–C8/C14 and C20–C25, respectively.

3.5. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies
CV studies were conducted to discover the oxidation and reduction properties of the synthesized PyBr and PyF.16,23,24 A Three-electrode system with the proposed sample as the working electrode, a platinum electrode as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode was employed during this study.16 The cyclic voltammograms of all compounds are listed in Fig. S3 in (ESI†). Table 6 summarizes the onset reduction potentials (Eonsetred), onset oxidation potentials (Eonsetox), HOMO energy levels, and LUMO energy levels obtained from the CV analysis. The values of HOMO and LUMO were calculated with reference to Fc+/Fc (−4.8 eV) using the following equations.24 HOMO = −e(Eonsetox + 4.8) (eV)(1) LUMO = −e(Eonsetred + 4.8) (eV)(2)

In this analysis, the oxidation states were identified at 0.55 V and 0.32 V from the anodic peaks of PyBr and PyF, respectively. The oxidation peak observed is due to the electron-donating ability, which causes the peak to shift toward the anodic position.49PyF possessed a lower Eonsetox of 0.32 V, indicating that the presence of the strong electron-donating –OCH3 substituent group caused less occurrence of oxidation, thus leading to lower potential values.23 As for the reduction states, the cathodic peaks are formed due to the flow of donated electrons during the oxidation process; poor cathodic peaks correspond to electron oxidation before being reduced.49 Hence, this indicates that the reason for the weak cathodic peaks of PyBr and PyF is the lack of electron transfer to undergo the reduction process. The Eonsetred values were found to be −0.82 V and −0.84 V corresponding to PyBr and PyF, respectively.
The Eonsetox and Eonsetred values were applied to calculate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, respectively.23,24 The HOMO and LUMO of PyBr and PyF were calculated and are illustrated in Fig. 8. Appropriate energy levels of HOMO and LUMO are essential to ensure the occurrence of electron injection and dye regeneration in DSSCs.50 According to former research,9,12 the HOMO energy level should be lower than the redox potential I−/I3− (−4.8 eV) so that the oxidized dye can be restored by gaining electrons from the electrolyte. Meanwhile, the LUMO energy level is expected to be higher than the conduction band (−4.0 eV) for the electrons to flow from the dye to the TiO2 layer.9 In this study, the redox potentials obtained from the CV analysis showed the HOMO and LUMO of PyBr and PyF were situated in the preferred energy range. This indicates the occurrence of electron injection and dye regeneration processes in both compounds, thus subsequently demonstrating their ideal characteristics as potential sensitizers for DSSCs.16

3.6. Surface morphology and elemental analyses
In FESEM analysis, the morphology of the TiO2 layer was analysed to study the absorption and charge transfer properties of the dye sensitizers in DSSCs.51,52 The surface morphology of PyBr and PyF was investigated using FESEM at the magnification of X10 000 (Fig. 9). TiO2 on the working electrode was immersed in the dye solutions under similar experimental conditions and drop-casted before the FESEM analysis. Fig. 9 shows the FESEM image of TiO2 loaded with PyBr and PyF after the absorption process. The images show that the dyes were distributed and well absorbed into the TiO2 layer. Besides, the absorption process of the dye solutions on TiO2 was also confirmed by the elemental composition of the absorbed TiO2 layer determined by EDX studies. Table 7 demonstrates the percentage of associated elements showing the presence of the dyes in the respective active layer, and the EDX spectra of PyBr and PyF are shown in Fig. 10a and b, respectively.

3.7. The performance study of the solar cells
In DSSCs, the dye sensitizer is an essential material for light harvesting and electron injection to the TiO2 layer.53 The important parameters in performance studies are short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power efficiency (η), which are tabulated in Table 8, and the J–V curves of DSSCs with PyBr and PyF compounds are presented in Fig. 11. These parameters were applied for the calculation of DSSC efficiency (η) of the fabricated PyBr and PyF dyes under AM 1.5 illumination (Pin = 100 mW cm−2) using eqn (3).9,12,18 (3)According to a previous study,54 the short-circuit current density (Jsc) influences the intramolecular and interfacial charge transfer from the dye molecules to the TiO2 layer, which affects the light-absorption properties. Good Jsc results indicate efficient electron transfer from the dye to TiO2, which facilitates solar cell efficiency.53 Besides, the electrochemical ability of the redox couple in the electrolyte influences the open-circuit voltage (Voc) values.55 This is dependent on the intensity of electrons injected into the conduction band and the recombination rate of electrons from the dye molecules with the oxidized electrolyte.54 As for the fill factor (FF), this parameter determines the goodness of the fabricated DSSC and depends on several factors, such as the fabrication process, resistance series and the environment.12 FF greatly affects the efficiency η of the DSSC, that is, higher FF values lead to better efficiency results.9

 Fig. 11  The J–V curves of DSSCs using PyBr (red curve) and PyF (blue curve). 
In this study, the highest DSSC efficiency determined was PyBr (η = 0.0350%) > PyF (η = 0.0002%). Both PyBr and PyF form D–π–A systems due to the addition of bromine and fluorine atoms as the acceptor groups, respectively, which increase the electron-accepting ability of these compounds.9,18,56 The D–π–A construction is favourable in DSSCs due to its ability to facilitate ICT during the electron excitation process.57 In the meantime, PyF has an additional substituent, namely the methoxy donor group (–OCH3), hence resulting in a decrement in DSSC efficiency compared with the compound without a donor attachment group. Besides, the structural backbone planarity of PyBr contributes to good ICT, which is an important feature in DSSC applications.12 The Jsc values of PyBr were higher compared with PyF, thus indicating better electron injection from the dye molecules to the TiO2 conduction band. In contrast, the lower efficiency result attained by PyF signifies a high magnitude of electron recombination, resulting in the back transfer of electrons from TiO2 to the oxidized species (I3−) in the electrolyte, which causes poor Voc and DSSC efficiency.55,58 The lower Voc result of PyF compared with PyBr is mainly due to its twisted structure, which significantly reduces the interfacial charge transfer, causing the efficiency to decline. Apart from that, the FF value is also a crucial parameter since it leads to higher DSSC efficiency by boosting the output power of the cell to its theoretical maximum.12 Referring to Table 8, the greatest value of FF is exhibited by PyBr (FF = 31.0%), indicating its suitability as a photosensitizer material that can further enhance the DSSC performance. Conversely, PyF with a methoxy substituent shows a lower FF value of only 24.9%. The study conducted by Teo and collaborators16 has defined that the low conversion efficiency of compounds with methoxy substituents is due to poor solubility in the solvent system, which causes crystals to be reformed on the surface of the TiO2 layer. This phenomenon triggers the layer of dye sensitizer to become thicker, thus increasing the cell resistance due to direct contact with the counter electrode.16,59 The occurrence of this phenomenon during the fabrication of PyF contributes to the low DSSC efficiency.
4. Conclusion
In summary, PyBr and PyF were successfully synthesized with the designated substituent groups and the single crystals were grown in acetone by employing the slow evaporation method. The ORTEP diagram based on the SCXRD analysis illustrates the s-cis configuration at the enone moiety (OC–CC) with respect to the CO and CC bonds in all single crystals. Besides, the molecular structure of PyF is twisted (16.80°), meanwhile, PyBr exists as a co-planar structure (6.77°), which presents a good approach to facilitating ICT within the compound and enhancing the photovoltaic parameters. The crystal packing alignment in both compounds is arranged in a head-to-tail configuration, thus promoting the increment of charge transfer within the molecules. In the UV-Vis analysis, the energy gaps of PyBr and PyF were calculated as 2.74 eV and 2.78 eV, respectively, indicating high electron transfer from the ground state to the excited state. According to the CV analysis, both compounds are located in the suitable energy range, that is, the energy levels of HOMO were situated below the redox potential (I−/I3−), and those of LUMO were above the conduction band of TiO2, thus ensuring the electron-injection and dye-regeneration processes based on the oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively. The structural configuration of PyBr is end-capped by the donor pyrene and acceptor (–Br) substituent groups, forming a D–π–A system, which induces ICT due to the electron-accepting ability. The attachment of a strong donor methoxy group (–OCH3) in PyF causes a decrement in efficiency. The higher energy conversion efficiency of DSSC using PyBr is also attributed to the increased degree of planarity in comparison with the twisted structure of PyF. These properties validate that PyBr is the suitable photosensitizer material for DSSC applications.
