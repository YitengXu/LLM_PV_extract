    , Accepted 13th February 2017First published on 14th February 2017AbstractIn recent years, substantial efforts have been devoted to exploring reduced graphene oxide/TiO2 (RGO/TiO2) composite materials; however, there is still a paucity of reports on the construction of reduced graphene oxide/TiO2 with oxygen vacancies (RGO/TiO2-OV) via a facile two-step wet chemistry approach. In this work, we show a proof-of-concept study follow RGO introduced into TiO2 with oxygen vacancies, the role of oxygen vacancies as active sites in reduced graphene oxide-modified TiO2. The photocatalytic performance and related properties of blank-TiO2, blank-TiO2 with oxygen vacancies (blank-TiO2-OV), RGO/TiO2, and RGO/TiO2-OV were comparatively studied. It was found that due to the incorporation of RGO, RGO/TiO2 and RGO/TiO2-OV exhibit a higher photocatalytic performance under simulated solar light irradiation than their counterparts without rGO. More importantly, it was found that blank-TiO2 has a higher photocatalytic activity than blank-TiO2-OV under simulated solar light irradiation. However, RGO/TiO2 shows a lower photocatalytic activity than rGO/TiO2-OV. By a series of combined techniques, we found that the introduction of a component, such as RGO, with the matched energy band to TiO2 could lead to the formation of a long-lived electron-transfer state, thus prolonging the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, during the photocatalytic process, RGO could tune the role of oxygen vacancies in TiO2 from recombination centers to active sites. These findings are of great significance for the design of effective photocatalytic materials in the field of solar energy conversion.
Introduction
Currently, titanium dioxide (TiO2) is mainly used as a pigment for toothpastes, paints, plastics, and textiles, as well as sunscreen creams.1 This may change soon as TiO2 has emerged as one of the most promising photocatalysts in practical applications such as in the degradation of pollutants (dyes, bacteria, and volatile organic pollutants), water splitting to hydrogen, photocatalytic reduction (such as CO2 photoreduction into solar fuels, reduction of nitrobenzenes to aminobenzenes, and reduction of heavy metal ions), and selective organic transformations (e.g., alcohols to aldehydes, and C–H activation) for the synthesis of fine chemicals.1–21 As compared to other semiconducting materials, TiO2 presents several advantages, including physical and chemical stability, easy availability, non-toxicity, low-cost, and unique electronic and optical properties, for photocatalytic reactions.5 However, the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2 is greatly affected by its surface microstructure including its shape, morphology, amount of surface –OH groups, surface electronic states, defects, etc.16–21 In particular, recent studies have revealed that some physical and chemical properties of TiO2 such as adsorption, photocatalytic activity and selectivity can be modulated by its defect disorder.1,22–25
Among all the defects identified in TiO2, oxygen vacancies are one of the most important and are thought to be the prevalent defects in many oxides.22–28 Oxygen vacancies in TiO2 have been extensively investigated both by theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations.1,22–25,29–61 Oxygen vacancies can be deliberately introduced by thermal treatment under a reducing atmosphere, electron- or ion-beam bombardment, doping with metal or non-metal ions, or photocatalytic reaction.29–61 It has been shown that photocatalytic properties, including electronic structure and charge transport ability, and surface properties of TiO2-based oxides are closely related to oxygen vacancies.1,22–25,29–61 Moreover, it has been reported that oxygen vacancies, recombination center, and active sites are believed to strongly influence the reactivity of metal oxides for heterogeneous catalysis.58–61 For example, Xu and coauthors have demonstrated that the oxygen vacancies in TiO2 nanosheets with exposed {001} facets, induced by photocatalytic reaction, serve as a recombination center, thus hampering the separation process of photoinduced charge carriers under UV light irradiation.58 On the other hand, Zuo et al. showed that oxygen vacancies can improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 under visible-light, which can be attributed to the generation of local states below the conduction band edge by the oxygen vacancies.59 Theoretical studies have also demonstrated that a high oxygen vacancy concentration could form electronic states vacancy band below the conduction band.60 However, oxygen vacancies in the lattice may serve as recombination centers for the photoinduced electrons and holes, which reduces the photocatalytic activity.59–61 For a photocatalytic reaction, it is well-known that the competition among the recombination, trapping, and transfer of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs determines the overall quantum efficiency of the photocatalyst and impacts the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, there is great interest in the development of a controllable synthesis of TiO2 with oxygen vacancies (TiO2-OV) and exploiting their unique properties for photocatalytic applications.
Over the past few years, reduced graphene oxide/TiO2 (RGO/TiO2) has received significant attention due to its combination of two promising components and has been widely investigated for photocatalysis.5,62–81 In particular, graphene (GR, GR is also referred to as RGO in the literature), is an important material and another allotrope of carbon that has many exceptional properties, such as unique planar structure, excellent transparency, superior electron conductivity and mobility, and can be used as an ideal high-performance candidate for photocatalyst carrier or promoter.5,62–85 By incorporating RGO, which has a matching energy band structure, into TiO2-OV, we could easily elucidate the role of the local states resulting from oxygen vacancies. However, to date, the preparation and utilization of RGO/TiO2 composites with oxygen vacancies (RGO/TiO2-OV) are still ongoing, and these composites have not been evaluated yet for the photocatalytic degradation of HCHO. Formaldehyde is an important precursor to many other materials and chemical compounds. It is mainly used in the production of industrial resins such as for particle board and coatings. In view of its widespread use, toxicity, and volatility, formaldehyde poses a significant danger to human health. In 2011, the US National Toxicology Program described formaldehyde as a known human carcinogen.
In the present study, we fabricated RGO/TiO2-OV composites via a facile two-step wet chemistry approach and utilized them for the photocatalytic degradation of HCHO in liquid-phase and gas-phase under simulated solar light irradiation. The photocatalytic performance and related properties of blank-TiO2, blank-TiO2-OV, RGO/TiO2, and RGO/TiO2-OV were comparatively studied. It was found that RGO/TiO2 and RGO/TiO2-OV exhibit a higher photocatalytic performance than their non-RGO counterparts under simulated solar light irradiation. More importantly, it was found that blank-TiO2 exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity than blank-TiO2-OV under simulated solar light irradiation. However, RGO/TiO2 displays a lower photocatalytic activity than RGO/TiO2-OV. Note that our research work constitutes the first study to conceptually demonstrate that introducing RGO into TiO2-OV could tune the role of oxygen vacancies from recombination centers to active sites in TiO2. Moreover, a comparative study among blank-TiO2, blank-TiO2-OV, RGO/TiO2, and RGO/TiO2-OV was carried out. Our current study significantly highlights the importance of the rational design of RGO/semiconducting composites with oxygen vacancies, to achieve an improved photocatalytic performance for practical applications in the field of converting solar energy into chemical energy.
Experimental section
Preparation

Reagents. 
Graphite powder, sulfuric acid (H2SO4), potassium persulfate (K2S2O8), phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), nitric acid (HNO3), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and ethanol (C2H5OH) were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Titanium fluoride (TiF4) was obtained from Alfa Aesar China Co., Ltd (Tianjin, China). All materials (analytical grade) were used as received without further purification. Deionized water used in the synthesis was obtained from local sources.


Synthesis. 
(a) Synthesis of graphene oxide (GO). Graphene oxide (GO), the precursor of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) in this study, was prepared via a modified Hummers method, which was also used in previous studies.5,70–72,82 (b) Fabrication of the RGO/TiO2 composites with oxygen vacancies. GO was ultrasonicated in 200 mL of deionized water for even dispersion. Then, 4.0 g of TiF4 was added to the abovementioned GO solution to prepare the composite. This mixture solution was ultrasonicated for 1 h and then heated to 343 K in an open oil bath under magnetic stirring and N2 bubbling for 24 h. The mixture was separated by centrifugation, washed until the pH of the rinsed water became neutral, and fully dried at 333 K in an oven. The as-obtained composites were aged in 26 mL of deionized water and 13 mL of anhydrous ethanol solution under vigorous stirring for 0.5 h to obtain a homogeneous suspension. This was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon-sealed autoclave and maintained at 393 K for 12 h. The products were cooled down to room temperature, separated by centrifugation, and washed with water and absolute ethanol. After drying, the RGO/TiO2 composite with oxygen vacancies was obtained. The photocatalysts prepared following this procedure were denoted as 1% RGO/TiO2-OV, 5% RGO/TiO2-OV, 10% RGO/TiO2-OV, and 30% RGO/TiO2-OV. The weight amount of RGO as determined by calcination was 0.91 wt%, 4.78 wt%, 9.52 wt%, and 28.17 wt% for 1% RGO/TiO2-OV, 5% RGO/TiO2-OV, 10% RGO/TiO2-OV, and 30% RGO/TiO2-OV, respectively. Calcination in air at 873 K for 2 h was sufficient enough for the complete removal of RGO form the samples. Blank-TiO2 with oxygen vacancies was synthesized via the same procedure as that for the RGO/TiO2 nanocomposite with oxygen vacancies, but without the addition of GO. The synthetic procedure for RGO/TiO2 (without vacancies) was the same, with the exception that the N2 bubbling was replaced by O2 bubbling. The photocatalysts prepared in this way were denoted as 1% RGO/TiO2, 5% RGO/TiO2, 10% RGO/TiO2, and 30% RGO/TiO2. The weight amount of RGO as determined by calcination was 0.90 wt%, 4.80 wt%, 9.51 wt% and 28.19 wt% for 1% RGO/TiO2, 5% RGO/TiO2, 10% RGO/TiO2 and 30% RGO/TiO2, respectively.

Characterization
Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements were performed using a Bruker EPR A 300 spectrometer under dark condition. Typically, a 5 mg portion of the photocatalyst powder was placed in a quartz-glass sample tube. The settings for the ESR spectrometry measurements were as follows: center field of 3580.26 G, modulation frequency of 100.00 KHz, microwave frequency of 9.50 GHz, and power of 6.34 mW. The electrochemical analysis was carried out using a conventional three-electrode cell with a Pt plate and a Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was 0.2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution without an additive (pH = 6.8). The working electrode was prepared using indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass previously cleaned by ultrasonication in ethanol for 30 min and dried at 353 K. The boundary of the ITO glass was protected using a scotch tape. A 10 mg sample was dispersed in 1 mL of ethanol by ultrasonication to obtain a slurry. The slurry was deposited onto the pretreated ITO glass. The working electrode was dried overnight under ambient conditions. Then, the Scotch tape was removed, and the uncoated part of the electrode was protected with epoxy resin. The exposed area of the working electrode was 0.25 cm2. The simulated solar light irradiation source consisted of a system equipped with a 300 W Xe arc lamp, which is the same light source as that used for the photocatalytic activity test. The photocurrent was measured using a BAS Epsilon workstation without bias. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were conducted using a Precision PARC workstation. The crystalline structure of the samples was determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV) with Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in a 2θ ranging from 5° to 80° at the scan rate of 8° per minute. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using an Edinburgh Analytical Instrument PLS920 system. The optical properties of the samples were analyzed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary 500, Varian), in which BaSO4 was employed as the internal reflectance standard. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area was determined by nitrogen adsorption using a Micromeritics Gemini VII 2390 apparatus. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the samples via a FEI Nova NANOSEM230 spectrophotometer. Raman spectroscopic measurements were performed using a Renishaw in Via Raman System 1000 with a 532 nm Nd:YAG excitation source at room temperature. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a H-7650 instrument at the accelerating voltage of 100 kV.
Photocatalytic measurements
(a) Liquid-phase photocatalytic degradation of HCHO. The liquid-phase photocatalytic degradation of HCHO was carried out in a quartz tube under irradiation with simulated solar light. The concentration of formaldehyde was determined by a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-1600PC, MAPADA Co. Ltd) by the acetylacetone–ammonium acetate method, and the acetylacetone (0.5 mL/100 mL) and ammonium acetate solutions (1.75 g/100 mL) were used right after being prepared. Typically, a suspension of 0.1 g of catalyst and 120 mL of a formaldehyde solution were ultrasonicated in a quartz tube to evenly disperse 0.1 g catalyst and 115 mL deionized water and then 5 mL of formaldehyde solution (37–40%) was added. Before irradiation, the suspensions were stirred at a constant magnetic speed in the dark for 1 h to ensure the establishment of an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The concentration of formaldehyde solution at this time was marked as C0. Subsequently, under ambient conditions and stirring, the quartz tube was exposed to a simulated solar light irradiation (320–780 nm) produced by a 300 W Xe arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd). A 4 mL sample was taken from the solution at certain time intervals throughout the experiment and 3 mL of ammonium acetate and 3 mL of acetylacetone were added after the sample was centrifuged to remove the catalyst. Subsequently, the sample was placed in an oil-bath at a constant temperature of 70 °C for 10 min and then cooled down. The solution was analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer to obtain the concentration of residual formaldehyde solution (marked as C). Upon prolonging the irradiation time, a gradual decrease in the maximum absorption intensity could be observed in the UV-visible absorption spectrum. These changes in the absorption spectrum at 414 nm were plotted against the irradiation time (C/C0 as the ordinate and the irradiation time as the abscissa), such that the degradation tendency of formaldehyde solution was obtained. (b) Gas-phase photocatalytic degradation of HCHO. The gas-phase photocatalytic degradation of HCHO was carried out under simulated solar light irradiation (320–780 nm) in a rectangular fixed-bed quartz reactor operating in a single-pass mode. All catalysts were sieved to obtain particles with a size of 0.21–0.25 mm. For the photocatalytic degradation test under simulated solar light, a system equipped with a 300 W Xe-arc lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Perfectlight Co. Ltd) was used as the irradiation source. A bubbler that contained HCHO was immersed in an ice-water bath containing 1.2 g of catalyst, and about 500 ppm of HCHO were bubbled with oxygen at the total flow rate of 20 mL min−1. All the photocatalytic experiments were carried out only after the adsorption–desorption equilibrium of HCHO was established. The reaction temperature was maintained at 27 ± 1 °C by an air-cooling system. Simultaneous determinations of HCHO and CO2 concentrations were performed using an online gas chromatograph (HP6890) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Conversion and mineralization of HCHO were defined as follows:% conversion = [(C0 − C)/C0 × 100]% mineralization = [(CO2)produced/HCHOconverted] × 100where C0 is the initial concentration of HCHO and C is the concentration of HCHO after the photocatalytic reaction.
Results and discussion
Reduced graphene oxide/TiO2 with oxygen vacancies (RGO/TiO2-OV) was prepared following a two-step process in a solution phase. The first step is to load the TiO2 with oxygen vacancies (TiO2-OV) ingredient onto the 2D sheet of graphene oxide (GO) by the hydrolysis process of TiF4 with N2 bubbling in a well-dispersed GO aqueous solution at a low temperature. Subsequently, insulating GO is transformed into electron-conducting graphene (GR) by a well-established hydrothermal reduction treatment. This can also promote the interfacial interactions between TiO2-OV and GR. GR is often called RGO because in most cases, GR-based composites for photocatalysts are often obtained by the reduction of GO. Fig. 1 shows the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of the as-prepared RGO, blank-TiO2, blank-TiO2-OV, RGO/TiO2, and RGO/TiO2-OV samples (herein, 5 wt% RGO was taken as an example). It can be seen that for RGO, blank-TiO2, and RGO/TiO2, no apparent signal is detected. By contrast, for blank-TiO2-OV and RGO/TiO2-OV, a symmetrical, sharp signal appearing at g = 2.004 provides clear evidence that both blank-TiO2-OV and RGO/TiO2-OV contain a large number of oxygen vacancies.58,86,87 According to previous reports, this signal is due to electrons trapped in oxygen vacancies. To further confirm the presence of oxygen vacancies in TiO2, we performed Raman analysis, and the results are displayed in Fig. S1 (in the ESI†). For blank-TiO2, the Raman pattern displays the four Raman modes of 147 cm−1, 399 cm−1, 515 cm−1, and 637 cm−1. However, two new modes appear at 157 cm−1 and 173 cm−1 in the blank-TiO2-OV.48 The newly generated Raman-active phonons are closely related to a nonstoichiometric TiO2−x layer in blank-TiO2-OV due to the presence of oxygen vacancies.

To examine the effect of oxygen vacancies and RGO on the crystal structure of TiO2, we characterized blank-TiO2, blank-TiO2-OV, RGO/TiO2 and RGO/TiO2-OV by X-ray diffraction (herein, 5 wt% RGO was taken as an example). The results are shown in Fig. 2. It can be observed that blank-TiO2, blank-TiO2-OV, RGO/TiO2, and RGO/TiO2-OV have similar X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, and only the peaks identified as the anatase structure of TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272) are observed. In addition, according to the Scherrer formula, the average crystallite sizes of the TiO2 particles as calculated from the (101), (004), (200), (105), and (211) peaks of the XRD patterns are shown in Table S1 (in the ESI†). The average crystallite size of the TiO2 particles is about 21.2, 21.2, 21.4 and 21.4 nm for RGO/TiO2-OV, RGO/TiO2, blank-TiO2-OV, and blank-TiO2, respectively. Furthermore, the TiO2 particle size was confirmed to be in the range of 15–25 nm by the TEM images, shown in Fig. 3. These results indicate that the crystal structure and size of TiO2 does not change for both blank-TiO2-OV and RGO/TiO2-OV. However, no apparent peak for RGO was detected in the patterns of the RGO/TiO2 and RGO/TiO2-OV composites, which might be due to the low amount and relatively low diffraction intensity of RGO in the composites, and the same phenomenon has also been reported in previous studies.70,71 To examine the effect of the oxygen vacancies and RGO on the optical properties of TiO2, we used the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) to characterize blank-TiO2, blank-TiO2-OV, RGO/TiO2, and RGO/TiO2-OV samples (herein, 5 wt% RGO was taken as an example), as shown in Fig. 4. It can be observed that the blank-TiO2-OV sample exhibits a red shift to higher wavelengths in the absorption edge, which is considerably different for the blank-TiO2 sample. The enhanced absorption of blank-TiO2-OV in the visible region is attributed to the presence of oxygen vacancies, which can serve as color centers to activate TiO2 under visible light irradiation.88,89 Moreover, a qualitative red shift to a higher wavelength was observed in the absorption edge for RGO/TiO2 and RGO/TiO2-OV. Therefore, the introduction of oxygen vacancies and RGO can effectively promote the visible light absorption of the samples.

The relative photocatalytic activity of each synthesized material (blank-TiO2, blank-TiO2-OV, RGO/TiO2, and RGO/TiO2-OV) was comparatively investigated by evaluating the liquid-phase photocatalytic degradation of formaldehyde (HCHO), which is a well-known organic pollutant in indoor air and wastewaters. Blank experiments showed that no activity was observed in the absence of catalyst or light irradiation. The controlled experiment with bare RGO also shows no photocatalytic activity for the degradation of HCHO. Therefore, the presence of both illumination and photocatalyst is necessary for the photocatalytic reaction to proceed. Fig. S2 (in the ESI†) displays the photocatalytic activity for the degradation of HCHO under simulated solar light irradiation over the RGO/TiO2-OV and RGO/TiO2 composites. It is clear that the 5% RGO/TiO2-OV composite shows the best photocatalytic performance, suggesting that the favorable synergistic effect of RGO and the oxygen vacancies in TiO2-OV plays an important role in enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the RGO/TiO2-OV composite. Fig. 5 shows the data for the liquid-phase degradation of HCHO over blank-TiO2-OV, blank-TiO2, 5%RGO/TiO2, and 5%RGO/TiO2-OV. It was clearly demonstrated that the 5% RGO/TiO2-OV composite showed the best performance because its lowering rate for C/C0 was the fastest among the four samples. Within 80 min after the light irradiation, HCHO was almost completely degraded, largely exceeding the performance of blank-TiO2-OV. As for blank-TiO2 and 5% RGO/TiO2, the degradation rate of HCHO also exceeded than that over blank-TiO2-OV. On the basis of previous studies, the degradation of HCHO can be ascribed to a pseudo-first-order reaction with a simplified Langmuir–Hinshelwood model when C0 is very small. In addition, a pseudo-first-order relationship was revealed by the plots of ln(C0/C) vs. irradiation time (t): ln(C0/C) = kat, where ka is the apparent first-order rate constant. As displayed in Fig. 5b, the kinetic rate constants follow the order 5% RGO/TiO2-OV (0.0462 min−1) > 5% RGO/TiO2 (0.0232 min−1) > blank-TiO2 (0.00641 min−1) > blank-TiO2-OV (0.00481 min−1).
 Fig. 5  Liquid-phase photocatalytic degradation of HCHO under simulated solar light irradiation over blank-TiO2-OV, blank-TiO2, 5% RGO/TiO2, and 5% RGO/TiO2-OV. 
To investigate the generality of the photocatalytic activity trend for the photocatalytic degradation of HCHO in other phase, we also carried out the photocatalytic degradation of HCHO in gas-phase under simulated solar light. Fig. 6 shows the conversion of HCHO and the amount of produced CO2 during the gas-phase degradation of HCHO under simulated solar light irradiation performed at room temperature and ambient pressure. Blank experiments show that no photocatalytic activity is observed in the absence of catalyst or light irradiation, thus confirming that the degradation reaction is indeed enabled by a photocatalytic process. From Fig. 6, it is obvious that 5% RGO/TiO2-OV shows a very stable activity towards the degradation of HCHO in the gas phase. During the photocatalytic testing of 20 h, the conversion of HCHO is maintained at 94.8%, nearly irrespective of the reaction time. The amount of produced CO2 is maintained at the average amount of 426 ppm, which corresponds to an average mineralization ratio of 95.3%. The photocatalytic efficiency, based on the HCHO average conversion rate and the average CO2 amount produced, follows the order 5% RGO/TiO2-OV (94.8%, 426 ppm) > 5% RGO/TiO2 (90.6%, 395 ppm) > blank-TiO2 (84.4%, 346 ppm) > blank-TiO2-OV (82.3%, 323 ppm).
 Fig. 6  Plots of the HCHO conversion (a) and produced CO2 (b) versus time for the gas-phase photocatalytic degradation of HCHO over blank-TiO2-OV, blank-TiO2, 5% RGO/TiO2, and 5% RGO/TiO2-OV under simulated solar light irradiation. 
The abovementioned photocatalytic activity test demonstrates that the photocatalytic performance of the RGO/TiO2-OV composite can be rationally improved by the introduction of RGO. Significantly, our current results obviously suggest that the introduction of the matched energy band RGO to form a long-lived electron-transfer state could prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers. To better understand this theory, we conducted the photoluminescence (PL) and photoelectrochemical analysis to characterize the blank-TiO2, blank-TiO2-OV, RGO/TiO2, and RGO/TiO2-OV samples.
PL spectroscopy was applied in the field of semiconducting photocatalysis for elucidating the surface processes. The PL spectrum is an effective way to study the electronic structure, optical and photochemical properties of semiconducting materials, by which information such as oxygen vacancies and defects, as well as the efficiency of charge carrier trapping, migration, and transfer can be obtained.90 Therefore, PL spectra are often employed to study surface processes involving the electron–hole fate in semiconductors. When the electron–hole pairs recombine after a photocatalyst is irradiated, photons are emitted, which results in PL. This behavior is due to a reverse radiative deactivation from the excited state in Ti species. As shown in Fig. 7, the addition of RGO leads to PL quenching. In particular, the PL intensity of RGO/TiO2-OV is lower than that of RGO/TiO2, whereas that of blank-TiO2 is lower than that of blank-TiO2-OV. Note that RGO/TiO2-OV shows the most significantly diminished PL intensity as compared to the other samples, thus indicating the most efficient inhibition of charge carriers recombination and tuning the role of oxygen vacancies in TiO2 by RGO as active sites, which seems to be well consistent with their photocatalytic activity.

The improved efficiency in inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers for RGO/TiO2-OV can be further confirmed by photoelectrochemical analyses. Fig. 8 shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots of the blank-TiO2, blank-TiO2-OV, RGO/TiO2, and RGO/TiO2-OV electrodes under simulated solar light irradiation, all of which show depressed semicircles. Note that the introduction of RGO causes a significant decrease in the arc for RGO/TiO2-OV compared with other samples, which suggests the more efficient transfer of charge carriers over RGO/TiO2-OV than that over other samples. Fig. 9a and b show the photocurrent transient response and chopping simulated solar light photocurrent–voltage curves for the electrodes of blank-TiO2, blank-TiO2-OV, RGO/TiO2 and RGO/TiO2-OV upon simulated solar light irradiation. It is clear that with the light switched -on and -off cycles, the RGO/TiO2-OV sample exhibits the highest photocurrent transient response upon simulated solar light irradiation among these four samples, suggesting a remarkably efficient separation of charge carriers, i.e., electron–hole pairs, which is in agreement with the highest photocatalytic activity of RGO/TiO2-OV towards the degradation of HCHO in liquid phase and gas phase. Once the light is switched off, the photocurrent rapidly decreases to zero. Furthermore, note that the photocurrent transient response over blank-TiO2 is higher than that over blank-TiO2-OV, which is in line with the lower photocatalytic activity of blank-TiO2-OV compared to that of blank-TiO2. These results suggest that the introduction of the matched energy band RGO to TiO2, which could form a long-lived electron-transfer state, prolongs the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers. This is in close agreement with the EIS results.

To further confirm that the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers is the most predominant factor determining the overall photocatalytic performance of RGO/TiO2-OV towards the degradation of HCHO, we performed the specific surface area and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, and the results are listed in Table S2 and Fig. S3 (in the ESI†), respectively. The surface area of blank-TiO2-OV, blank-TiO2, 5% RGO/TiO2, and 5% RGO/TiO2-OV is ca. 55 m2 g−1, 56 m2 g−1, 59 m2 g−1, and 58 m2 g−1, respectively. Moreover, it can be observed from Fig. S3 (in the ESI†) that TiO2 particles are uniformly spread on the surface of the RGO nanosheets. In addition, 5% RGO/TiO2 and 5% RGO/TiO2-OV present a similar microscopic morphology and structure. These results suggest that the surface area, microscopic morphology, and structural features are not the primary factors leading to the large discrepancy in photoactivity. However, the lifetime and transfer efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs is the key and predominant factor that determines the overall photocatalytic activity of 5% RGO/TiO2-OV.
To further understand the significant photocatalytic activity enhancement in the RGO/TiO2-OV composites, the recombination and transfer of electron was investigated, and a proposed mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 10. It has been reported that the calculated Fermi level (EF) of RGO and the conduction band (CB) edge (ECB) of TiO2 are ca. −0.08 and −0.29 V versus NHE, respectively.91 Moreover, it has been reported that the electronic states vacancy band (EOV) is determined to be ca. 0.46 V versus NHE.1,30 Because EOV (TiO2) > EF (RGO) > ECB (TiO2), under simulated solar light irradiation, the electron–hole pairs are generated from the TiO2 photocatalyst, electrons transfer from the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 to RGO, and then from RGO to the electronic states vacancy band, thus forming a long-lived electron-transfer state. However, without introducing a component with a matching energy band structure (RGO) in TiO2-OV, the electronic state vacancy band can trap the electron–hole pairs, becoming a recombination center, and thus decreasing the photocatalytic activity. Therefore, RGO could shift the role of oxygen vacancies in TiO2 from recombination centers to active sites. This finding is of great significance for the design of effective photocatalytic materials in the field of solar energy conversion.
 Fig. 10  Proposed route of recombination and electron transfer. 
On the basis of the abovementioned discussion, it can be concluded that the enhanced photocatalytic performance of the RGO/TiO2-OV composites can be attributed to the synergetic effect between TiO2-OV and RGO components in this hybrid photocatalyst, and to the formation a long-lived electron-transfer state, which efficiently prolongs the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers.
Conclusions
In summary, a novel strategy was developed to fabricate RGO/TiO2-OV. Note that our research work demonstrates the preparation and utilization of RGO/TiO2-OV composites for the photocatalytic degradation of HCHO in liquid phase and gas phase for the first time. The photocatalytic performance and related properties of blank-TiO2, blank-TiO2-OV, RGO/TiO2, and RGO/TiO2-OV were comparatively studied. It was found that RGO/TiO2 and RGO/TiO2-OV exhibit higher photocatalytic performances than their non-rGO counterparts under simulated solar light irradiation. More importantly, it was found that blank-TiO2, in comparison with blank-TiO2-OV, have higher photocatalytic activity under simulated solar light irradiation. However, RGO/TiO2 showed a lower photocatalytic activity compared to RGO/TiO2-OV. In addition, the superior photocatalytic performance of RGO/TiO2-OV composites can be attributed to synergetic effect between TiO2-OV and RGO components in this hybrid photocatalyst, and to the formation a long-lived electron-transfer state, thus efficiently prolonging the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, it was concluded that RGO could tune the role of the oxygen vacancies in TiO2 from recombination centers to active sites. This finding is of great significance for the design of effective photocatalytic materials in the field of solar energy conversion.
