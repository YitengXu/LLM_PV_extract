1. Introduction
In recent years, display devices have become common due to the development of mobile phones, flat-screen TVs, personal computer monitors, etc. The essential element for such devices is a thin-film transistor (TFT).
TFTs are usually manufactured using organic materials or inorganic materials as channels. Organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) offer many advantages such as processability and mechanical flexibility over inorganic technologies2–4 and have been developed for use in a wide range of applications including displays,5,6 sensors,7,8 and radio frequency identification.9,10 However, the mobilities of organic TFTs are usually lower than 1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Although many methods have been developed to enhance the mobilities of organic TFTs, most mobilities reported for organic TFTs are lower than 10 cm2 V−1 s−1.11 The weak van der Waals interaction bonding neighboring molecules limits the further improvement of their carrier mobility. Therefore, the low carrier mobility of organic TFTs limits their device-switching speeds and their range of potential applications.
As to the inorganic TFTs, the polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) (50–400 cm2 V−1 s−1) TFT has a mobility one or two magnitudes higher than that of the amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) TFT (1 cm2 V−1 s−1) and organic TFT. However, the fabrication of this material is complicated and needs a temperature higher than 500 °C (even up to 900 °C) for crystallization, which is not suitable for flexible electronics application. Alternative semiconducting materials for thin field-effect transistors (TFTs), which have mobility at least comparable to that of amorphous silicon (a-Si) and may also be easily processed with low-cost techniques, are required to enable new opportunities for display and storage technologies.
Recently, the amorphous metal-oxide show many advantageous properties, such as the high mobility, optical transparency, and low process temperature. However, mobilities of these TFTs are usually lower than 10 cm2 V−1 s−1. In order to achieve a high mobility, it has to be annealed at a temperature higher than about 300 °C, which is a hurdle for the plastic film substrate.12–19 Advanced materials and processing techniques developed in recent years, such as nanowires, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and grapheme, which have been fabricated into TFTs for flexible electronic applications. These methods usually need complicated process procedures or high temperatures19–24 even if the device performance could be enhanced. Despite great efforts being exerted in this field, so far no one has succeeded in demonstrating a good performance TFT with relatively simple and real low-temperature processing suitable for high quality, low-cost and flexible displays.
In the present work, we have proposed a novel TFT that has an organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite as channel layer. This material is crystallized from organic halide and metal halide salts to form crystals in the ABX3 structure, where A is the organic cation, B is the metal cation and X is the halide anion (see Fig. 1). The inorganic component forms an extended framework bound by strong covalent or ionic (or both) interactions to provide high carrier mobility. The organic component facilitates the self-assembly of these materials, enabling hybrids to be deposited by the same simple, low-cost, low-temperature processes as the organic materials. The organic component is also used to tailor the electronic properties of the inorganic framework. Engineering the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite on the molecular scale may be done to maximize carrier mobility. The combination of high carrier mobility and ease of processing may make organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials good substitutes in all the applications put forth for organic materials. The potentially higher carrier mobility of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials may extend their application to higher speed devices than is presently possible with either a-Si or organic semiconductors. As we know, the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have been successfully used in solar cells,25–27 which the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been up to 20.1% (ref. 28) from 3.8% (ref. 29) due to distinct merits of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials.1,29–32 Thus the remarkable properties of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials illustrate that they are suitable for the application in TFTs.

In this paper, we proposed a new kind of thin-film field-effect transistor using organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 material as the semiconducting channel.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Thin film fabrication
Here, we used a facile vapor assisted solution approach to perovskite material formations with enhanced controllability over the film quality,33 where the inorganic framework film was formed by depositing precursor solution on the substrates, and subsequently treated with the desired organic vapor (Fig. 2). PbI2 solution was prepared in DMF at the concentration of 345 mg ml−1. The prepared PbI2 solution was preheated at 110 °C on a hot plate, followed by spin coating on the substrates at 4000 rpm for 40 s, at the same time a dry nitrogen gas flow was blown over the surface of the PbI2 solution during the spin-coating process in air,26 then put back on the hot plate for 15 min of drying. To obtain the perovskite thin film, substrates with PbI2 film were then put into a vacuum coating machine, then CH3NH3I was deposited by thermal evaporation for 0.5 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the perovskite films was annealed for 0.3 h at 100 °C.

2.2. Thin film field-effect transistors (TFTs) fabrication
Fig. 3 shows the structure of device of our perovskite thin film field-effect transistors.34 Heavily n-doped silicon wafers were used as the gate electrode. The gate dielectric layer was a 200 nm thermally grown silicon dioxide. Organic–inorganic hybrid CH3NH3PbI3 as the semiconducting channel was obtained via modified vapor-assisted solution process. High work-function metal source and drain electrodes such as Ag were deposited by evaporation through a shadow mask.

2.3. Analysis of characterizations on active layers and analysis of TFT devices
The crystal structures of the CH3NH3PbI3 films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips PANalytical X'Pert Pro) with a copper X-ray source, and the surface morphologies were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi SU8010) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Seiko SPA-400SPM UNIT). The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum measurements were conducted by a Fluorolog-3-212 steady state spectrometer. The laser wavelength is 350 nm. The electrical performance of the TFT devices was measured with Keysight Technologies B1500A Semiconductor Device Analyzer. All devices were tested in air and at room temperature. Device performances were extracted by the standard field-effect transistor equations that apply to both organic and inorganic TFTs. The mobility of the device was extracted using the following equation:μ = (dIDS/dVG)(L/VDCiW)where μ is the device mobility, ID and VG respectively correspond to the drain current and gate voltage, L channel length, W channel width and Ci the gate insulator capacitance. The sub-threshold slope (SS) was calculated as the minimum value of the inverse slope of the logID versus VG:SS = (dVG/dlogIDS)
3. Results and discussion
Organic–inorganic hybrid CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite materials via modified vapor-assisted solution process were obtained with full surface coverage, uniform grain structure with grain size up to micrometers. The key step is film growth via in situ reaction of the as-deposited film of PbI2 with CH3NH3I vapor (Fig. 2). This method is conceptually different from the current solution process and vacuum deposition by avoiding co-deposition of organic and inorganic species. In one-step deposition, the two precursor salts (metal halide and organic halide) are dissolved in an organic solvent, the mixture is spin-coated onto a substrate, and the perovskite is formed through an annealing process at around 100 °C, finally the perovskite crystals are micrometer-sized in size. However spin-coating the mixture directly onto a substrate initially resulted in a dewetting effect,35 thus leading to poor surface coverage.36,37 As to the co-deposition technique,38 although nearly 100% surface coverage can be obtained, the perovskite crystals obtained are a few hundred nanometers in size, and thus smaller than the micrometer-sized platelets obtained from spin-coating. However the modified vapor-assisted solution process we used to fabricate perovskite films combine the full surface coverage with micrometer-sized crystals, which indicates high-quality films.
Meanwhile, an additional step was introduced where a dry nitrogen gas flow was blown over the surface of the PbI2, promoting evaporation of the solvent and accelerating the supersaturation of the solution. In general, a solution precipitation process involves two steps: nucleation and crystal growth. Nuclei will form when a solution reaches supersaturation and the volume of the nuclei in the system would depend on the rate of nucleation and the degree of the supersaturation. This addition step where a dry nitrogen gas flow was blown over the surface facilitated a high degree of supersaturation of the PbI2 in the wet film during spin-coating, resulting in a large number of nuclei which reacted with CH3NH3I vapor and, finally, the full coverage of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer was obtained when the as-deposited film of PbI2 completely reacted with CH3NH3I vapor. This process takes advantage of the kinetic reactivity of CH3NH3I and thermodynamic stability of perovskite during the growth process in situ and provides films with grain sizes up to microscale, full surface coverage, and small surface roughness, which is required for TFTs channel.
Firstly, to optimize the perovskite films, we researched the influence of PbI2 solution concentration and the amount of evaporated CH3NH3I on perovskite films performance, respectively.
3.1. The influence of PbI2 solution concentration on perovskite films performance
Fig. 4 shows the top-view SEM images of PbI2 layer and perovskite films prepared with different PbI2 solution concentration varied from 100 mg ml−1 to 500 mg ml−1, where the amount of CH3NH3I is 159 mg. And X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of perovskite films corresponding to different PbI2 solution concentration were taken. As shown in Fig. 4F, a set of strong peaks at 14.08°, 28.41° and 31.85°, assigned to (110), (220) and (310) of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal,33,39 indicate an orthorhombic crystal structure of halide perovskite with high crystallinity. Meanwhile a tiny signature peak at 12.65° is observed in Fig. 4F(c and d),40 which indicates a low-level impurity of PbI2. Table 1 shows the surface roughness of PbI2 layer and perovskite films with different PbI2 solution concentration. We have found that the PbI2 solution concentration has main influence on the roughness and the PbI2 residue of perovskite films rather than the grain size. As can been seen, with the PbI2 solution concentration increasing, the surface roughness of the PbI2 film gradually increases (see Table 1). This change benefit PbI2 to contact MAI and convert completely to perovskite, where final perovskite films are obtained without PbI2 residue as shown in Fig. 4F(d and e). At the same time, the sufficient reaction is also beneficial to reducing surface roughness of perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1. However, when the PbI2 solution concentration is too high, for instance, 500 mg ml−1, the surface roughness of PbI2 layer would increase, leading to the increase of the surface roughness of the resulted perovskite films. Hence, considering with the surface roughness of perovskite films and the PbI2 residue, we suggest that the PbI2 solution concentration of 345 mg ml−1 is suitable to fabricate perovskite films.

3.2. The influence of amount of CH3NH3I evaporation on perovskite films performance
In order to further optimize CH3NH3PbI3 films to obtain larger crystals, we prepared three types of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films: type A, the amount of CH3NH3I precursor used in thermal evaporation process was 120 mg; type B, the amount of CH3NH3I precursor used in thermal evaporation process was 200 mg; type C, the amount of CH3NH3I precursor used in thermal evaporation process was 280 mg. Fig. 5 present scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of CH3NH3PbI3 films interfaced to SiO2 substrate.
 Fig. 5  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the CH3NH3PbI3 film: the amount of CH3NH3I precursor in thermal evaporation process is 120 mg (a), 200 mg (b), 280 mg (c), respectively. 
For type A (Fig. 5a), the grain size is the biggest, but there are many voids among adjacent grains. Although the CH3NH3PbI3 film is full surface coverage in type C (Fig. 5c), the grain sizes are only a few hundred nanometers. The grain sizes and the voids among adjacent grains are relevant to the density of nuclei which grows into grain. When the amount of CH3NH3I is low, the density of nuclei is low, resulting in large grain size, while due to the lack of crystal nuclei, many voids between (or in) the grains come up, leading to the poor surface coverage. On the contrary, excessive amount of CH3NH3I could bring high density of nuclei and cause small grain size. For type B, the CH3NH3PbI3 film has full surface coverage and small surface roughness in type B (Fig. 5b). Meanwhile, the grains as large as 3 μm were obtained. Full surface coverage and huge grains indicate the few grain boundaries and then a low density of trap states, which is crucial to the TFTs devices performance.
In order to further verify the crystallization of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films obtained via vapor-assisted solution process, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were taken. As shown in Fig. 6A. We can see the tiny signature peak at 12.65° is all observed in three types,40 and the emergence of a tiny signature peak at 12.65° is relative to the amount of CH3NH3I precursor, because PbI2 could not sufficiently react with CH3NH3I, when the amount of CH3NH3I precursor was low. However when the amount of CH3NH3I precursor was excessive, nuclei of CH3NH3PbI3 quickly appeared which resulted high density of nuclei of CH3NH3PbI3, then compact CH3NH3PbI3 film was obtained on the surface of PbI2, which hindered PbI2 further reaction with CH3NH3I and resulted in PbI2 residue. As can be observed (Fig. 6A), type B has almost no PbI2 residue. At the same time, a representative ultraviolet-visible photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of CH3NH3PbI3 thin film (sample B) is shown in Fig. 6B, which consists with previous reports that the PL is right at the band edge. Consequently, it is indicated that the amount of CH3NH3I have an obvious influence on crystallization of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 films, then effects perovskite TFT performance.

3.3. The performances of TFT with CH3NH3PbI3 as the channel
Then TFTs with CH3NH3PbI3 film as channel layer have been fabricated. This TFTs have a channel length L = 0.5 mm and channel width W = 5 mm, defined by Ag source and drain electrodes. The plot of drain current, ID, versus gate voltage, VG, is shown as a function of the applied same drain voltage Vds = 2 V (see Fig. 7a) for TFTs with different types of CH3NH3PbI3 channel layer. And obvious electrical field effect is all observed in three types TFTs.
 Fig. 7  The plot of drain current ID versus gate voltage VG (a) as a function of the amount of CH3NH3I precursor for the CH3NH3PbI3 film thin-film transistor at Vds = 2 V; (b) as a function of drain voltage Vds for the CH3NH3PbI3 film thin-film transistor in type B. 
The relevant parameters derived from ID–VG measurements corresponding to Fig. 7a are summarized in Table 2. From the plot of ID versus VG (Fig. 7a) used to calculate current modulation (ION/IOFF) and field-effect mobility, μ, in the linear regime. We can see that the performance of TFT in type B is the best, which the field-effect mobility is 566 cm2 V−1 s−1 for a ±25 V sweep of VG at Vds = 2 V with ION/IOFF > 104 (Fig. 7a). Simultaneously the sub-threshold current and threshold voltage is the smallest in type B, which value were 0.4035 V per decade, −3.501 V, respectively, which indicates the best device performance (see Table 2) among these three types TFTs. Considering that the un-patterned TFTs show overestimation of field effect mobility due to the peripheral current. Thus, a 30% reduction of the μ should be considered. Additionally, patterning the semiconductor to the active device region also reduces leakage through the insulator contributing to IOFF, increasing ION/IOFF to at least 104. There is no obvious gate induced leakage current in the organic inorganic hybrid perovskite TFTs, which may be related to the special state density distribution of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials. This is still under study.

4. Conclusions
In summary we demonstrated a thin-film field-effect transistor having an organic–inorganic hybrid CH3NH3PbI3 material as the semiconducting channel by low-temperature vapor-assisted solution process and made a preliminary optimization of the dosage of the precursors. Finally, we obtained an organic–inorganic hybrid CH3NH3PbI3 TFT with field-effect mobility of 396.2 cm2 V−1 s−1, current modulation greater than 104, sub-threshold current of 0.4035 V per decade and threshold voltage of −3.501 V. The mobility of organic–inorganic hybrid CH3NH3PbI3 TFTs is much higher than that of any other TFTs, such as Si-based TFTs, the metal-oxide TFTs and the best organic TFTs. Meanwhile, this material that can be processed by low temperature, which suggest that organic–inorganic hybrid TFTs may be suitable for applications that require low cost, low temperature, a large area, and the flexibility of plastic substrates. Furthermore, semiconducting organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials may be designed with a wide range of organic and inorganic components for use in TFTs and other flexible electronics (for example CH3NH3Pb(I1−xBrx)3). So it is believed that organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite TFTs performance can be further improved by material engineering and optimization of device structure.
