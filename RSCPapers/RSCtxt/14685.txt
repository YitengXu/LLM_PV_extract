    , Accepted 1st April 2019First published on 1st April 2019AbstractThe electron transport layer (ETL) is a critical component in planar single junction or tandem perovskite solar cells (PSCs), dominating the separation and electron extraction of charge carriers. Herein, we introduce a facile route to synthesize a SnO2 quantum dot (QD) colloidal solution at room temperature using an alcohol-based solvent with the additive of deionized-water. A superior homogeneous ETL is obtained by spin coating of the QD colloidal solution with post-deposition annealing. Compared to the ETL prepared with the SnCl2·2H2O anhydrous alcohol solution, the champion power conversion efficiency of PSCs deposited on the SnO2 QD based ETL is raised to 20.1% from 16.5%. The better performance is attributed to the excellent optical and electronic properties of the SnO2 QD based ETL. Experimental analyses reveal that the SnO2 QD based ETL enhances electron extraction and suppresses charge recombination, leading to improvement of solar cell performance. The appropriate concentration of the SnO2 QD based solution is explored and the appropriate ratio of anhydrous alcohol to deionized water of the SnO2 colloidal solution is obtained. Our results show the great potential of low temperature synthesized SnO2 QD films for application as ETLs or interconnecting buffer layers for future highly efficient and reproducible low-temperature processed tandem PSCs.
1. Introduction
In recent years, halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention because of their high solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency (PCE), low fabrication cost and better optical and electrical properties compared to other light harvesting materials.1–4 Since the introduction as light harvesters by Miyasaka and co-workers in 2009, their efficiency has been risen to 23.7% via film crystal growth control, interface and device engineering, solvent engineering, doping, etc. in the past eight years.5–9 In the reported methods, the appropriate choice of charge transporting layers (CTL) is very critical for device efficiency. TiO2 was first used as an electron transporting material (ETM)10–18 to prepare PSCs. As a type of mostly adopted ETM, TiO2 usually requires thermal annealing at 400 °C to form high quality films, resulting in increased costs and fabrication time. Therefore, ZnO, Zn2SnO4 and CdS have also been developed as ETMs and high power conversion is achieved afterwards.19–21 Moreover, some other inorganic and organic materials have been explored as hole transporting materials (HTMs).22–25
SnO2 has a large band-gap and favorable energy level alignment at the SnO2/perovskite interface and therefore it can facilitate photo-generated electron injection from the halide perovskite to SnO2.26 Furthermore, the wider band-gap gives it better stability under UV light illumination than TiO2 and ZnO. In view of the above merits, we have developed SnO2 as an efficient electron transport layer (ETL) in PSCs by spin-coating an ethanol precursor solution and annealing at 180 °C.27,28 We have also adopted one-step and low temperature hydrothermal method prepared SnO2 ETLs to improve the overall long-term performance of PSCs in our previous work.29 High quality SnO2 films prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) were used as ETLs yielding over 18% device efficiency.26 Solution reflux is a very important and commonly used method to prepare SnO2 nanocrystals (NCs).30 High performance PSCs have been reported by using SnO2 NC ETLs obtained by refluxing with heating the solution or microwave assisted non-aqueous sol–gel synthesis.31 The precursor solution needs to undergo hydrolysis (or alcoholysis), cross-linking, polycondensation and crystallization to form SnO2 nanocrystals.30 These chemical processes occur after spin-coating and must be energy driven, and therefore reflux or the microwave assisted process at various temperature is necessary for the formation of SnO2 nanocrystals by solution processing methods.31 Since our group reported PSCs with efficiency over 17%, SnO2 as an excellent ETL material has been used more and more frequently in highly efficient PSCs with PCEs over 20%.26,32–37 Anaraki et al. reported highly efficient PSCs using SnO2 as the ETL synthesized by a simple solution process, reaching a PCE over 20%.28 You and co-workers fabricated planar PSCs with a certified efficiency of 20.9% using a commercial nanoparticle ETL derived from the SnO2 colloidal water solution.38 We have also reported SnO2 quantum dots (QDs) prepared at room temperature by a water solution process with the addition of thiourea to the solution.39 Compact SnO2 ETLs can be produced by spin coating of these water solutions on substrates with post-thermal heating. However, water solution-processed SnO2 films encounter some problems. For example, the residue of additive (S, N) may be harmful to the device performance. And the water solution for ETL fabrication may damage the perovskite underneath the layer and is not feasible for the fabrication of inverted p–i–n structure single junction or future tandem solar cells. To facilitate the preparation technology, the exploration of an energetically favorable anhydrous, cost effective, green initiative and room temperature synthesis route for the preparation of SnO2 quantum dots is very meaningful, while there are relatively few relevant reports on it so far.
In this work, we developed a very facile wet chemical route to synthesize SnO2 QDs (Q-SnO2) as the ETL material at room temperature. SnO2 QDs were obtained by stirring the SnCl2·2H2O anhydrous alcohol and hydro solution at room temperature. We demonstrated that this simple processing method enables O2 from the atmosphere to be involved in solution, in turn supplying a reaction pathway to promote Sn2+ oxidation and controlled hydrolysis without reflux. After room temperature stirring, ultra-fine SnO2 QDs with diameters ∼2–4 nm can be obtained and dispersed in the alcohol solution to form a stable colloidal sol. Fabrication of SnO2 ETLs is conducted through spin coating of the SnO2 sol onto conductive substrates. Systematic investigations reveal that the conductivity and transmittance of the SnO2 QD ETL are higher than those of the SnO2 ETL prepared using the SnCl2·2H2O solution with sole ethanol as the solvent, and we call it N-SnO2 as in our previous work.39 More importantly, the QD SnO2 ETL has favorable band level alignment with the perovskite for fast interfacial electron extraction. Based on these SnO2 Q-ETLs, PSCs with a champion PCE and an average PCE of 20.1% and 18.8%, respectively, are obtained. These results are much higher than those of the devices using the SnO2 N-ETL prepared using the SnCl2·2H2O alcohol solution (champion PCE = 18.01%; average PCE = 17.50%). Our work provides an alternative route to improve the performance of the SnO2 ETL by a simple solution method without the need for additives (thiourea) or reflux or any other assisting process. We focused on the influence of alcohol–hydro ratio on the crystalline procedure, optical properties and electrical parameters, which determine the device performance including PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF. Meanwhile, we found that the SnO2 Q-ETL prepared at 100 °C exhibits similar performances to those of the Q-ETL annealed at 180 °C and it shows compatibility with flexible substrates.

Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from ShenZhen Feiming Science and Technology Co., Ltd. Li-bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) were purchased from Advanced election Tech. Ethanol was purchased from Aladdin. All the chemicals and reagents were used as received without any further purification.
2.2 Synthesis of the SnO2 QD colloidal precursor solution
The SnO2 QD colloidal solution was prepared by a facile solution processing method using SnCl2·2H2O as the raw material, and anhydrous ethanol and deionized water as the solvent. First, 1 mmol SnCl2·2H2O was added to the correct amount of anhydrous alcohol with stirring to form a homogeneous solution. Then the appropriate amount of deionized water was added to the above solution to form a suspension. The suspension was kept stirring for 48 h to form a SnO2 colloidal precursor solution. The concentration of the final SnO2 colloidal precursor solution was adjusted to 0.1 M by adding the appropriate amount of anhydrous alcohol and deionized water. The volume ratio of anhydrous alcohol to deionized water of various SnO2 colloidal precursor Q-solutions was controlled to be 7:1, 5:1, 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3. For comparison, 1 mmol SnCl2·2H2O was added to 10 mL anhydrous alcohol under stirring to form a pure alcohol SnCl2·2H2O N-solution. All the above processes were performed at room temperature without any assisting procedure.
2.3 Electron transport layer preparation
FTO glasses were washed with cleaning fluid, deionized water, acetone and ethanol sequentially and dried with nitrogen flow after the last step. To prepare SnO2 ETLs, the SnCl2·2H2O solution or SnO2 colloidal precursor solutions were spin coated on FTO at 6000 rpm and 3000 rpm for 30 s, and then heated at 100 °C for 3 hours and 180 °C for 45 min, respectively. Then, the as-deposited ETLs were treated with UV–ozone for 15 min.
2.4 Perovskite precursor solution and film preparation
The (MAPbI3)0.7(FAPbI3)0.3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared according to the following steps. Firstly, an anhydrous mixture of DMF and DMSO (volume ratio is 4:1) containing MAI (0.95 M), FAI (0.4 M), and PbI2 (1.3 M) was prepared by stirring at 60 °C for 6 h. Then, the precursor solution was spread on the FTO/ETL substrate followed by a two-stage spin coating process at 1000 rpm and 4000 rpm in sequence. During the second spin coating stage, 350 μL of chlorobenzene was poured on the spinning substrate. Finally, the film substrates were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min.
2.5 Hole transport layer and Au electrode preparation
The precursor solution of the hole transfer layer (HTM) was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene(spiro-MeOTAD), 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 17.5 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide acetonitrile solution (520 mg mL−1) into 1 mL chlorobenzene. Then, the HTM layer was deposited on the perovskite layer by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 20 s. Finally, 100 nm Au electrodes were thermally evaporated on top of the device under 1.8 × 10−3 Pa. The active areas of the devices were 0.09 cm2 which was defined by the aperture area of the mask.
2.6 Thin film and device characterization
The phase structure was characterized using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-6700F) was utilized to investigate the surface and cross-sectional morphology of PSC devices and SnO2 ETLs prepared using the SnCl2·2H2O alcohol solution or SnO2 colloidal precursor. The photovoltaic performance of PSCs was recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter with a delay time of 100 ms under one-sun AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar light simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192). The transmittance spectra were recorded using an UV-3600 spectrometer. Photoluminescence (PL) (excitation at 481.5 nm) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) (excitation at 481.5 nm and emission at 760 nm) were measured with an Edinburgh Instruments (FLS2100). The external quantum efficiency spectra were measured in air using a QE-R 3011 system (Enli) in the range of 300–800 nm.
3. Results and discussion
The SnO2 QD colloidal solution (the concentration is 0.1 M and the volume ratio of anhydrous alcohol to deionized water is 5:1) and SnCl2·2H2O anhydrous alcohol solution (0.1 M) were spin-coated onto glass substrates, respectively, followed by thermal annealing at 180 °C for 45 min. The structure and orientation of the two SnO2 ETLs prepared using the SnO2 colloidal solution (Q-SnO2) and SnCl2·2H2O solution (N-SnO2) were analyzed using XRD. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the peaks are indexed to the rutile-type tetragonal structure according to PDF card no. 01-072-1147 with a = b = 0.4735 nm and c = 0.3184 nm. The diffraction peaks of the Q-SnO2 ETL (Q-ETL) agreed with those of the SnO2 rutile structure quite well. One can find that the peaks of the N-ETL are very weak and its properties reflect that there are very small nano-crystals. This suggested that the Q-ETL undergoes better crystallization than the N-ETL by annealing at 180 °C. The most intense peak of the SnO2 ETL at 26.6° corresponds to the (110) diffraction of SnO2. The lattice distance of the (110) face, indexed according to PDF no. 01-072-1147, is 3.348 Å. We obtained a white suspension by removing alcohol at 80 °C from the SnCl2·2H2O alcohol solution. The XRD result of the white suspension is shown in Fig. 1(b). It is obvious that the white precipitate is amorphous. We also analyzed the yellow gel obtained by evaporating SnO2 colloidal precursor solutions at 80 °C by XRD. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the peaks match to SnO2 (PDF card no. 01-072-1147) quite well. Therefore, we suggest the formation mechanism as follows: firstly, the Sn(OH)Cl precipitate is obtained after deionized water is added to the SnCl2·2H2O anhydrous alcohol solution, and the reaction equation is SnCl2 + H2OSn(OH)Cl + HCl. Then, after 48 h stirring, Sn(OH)Cl transforms into SnO2 QDs by absorbing oxygen and the reaction equation is 2Sn(OH)Cl + O22SnO2 + 2HCl.

The transmission electron microscopy images of the SnO2 QD from the colloidal solution are shown in Fig. 2. From Fig. 2(a) and (b) we can see that the SnO2 colloidal solutions are composed of SnO2 quantum dots (QDs) which have a highly uniform size of 2–4 nm. Small particles are able to fully cover the FTO layer with the least thickness and form a compact ETL easily thus enhancing the device performance. According to Fig. 2(c), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy results indicate that the SnO2 QDs are well crystallized. Therefore, we can obtain even SnO2 QDs without reflux or any other assisting process by the present method. It can also be seen that the formation of SnO2 QDs is mainly finished in the room temperature process, and the feature of polycrystalline can be identified by the electron diffraction loops of (110), (101) and (211) crystal planes, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The lattice distance of (110) is 3.35 Å according to Fig. 2(c) and the results are in good accordance with the XRD results.

To get insight into the formation mechanism of the SnO2 ETL further, we deposited the SnO2 ETL with the SnO2 colloidal solution on glass by annealing at 75 °C for one hour. As 75 °C is higher than the boiling point of anhydrous ethanol, the residual anhydrous alcohol is considered to be removed by annealing. FTIR analysis was employed to study the effect of organic groups of the ETL annealed at 75 °C. As shown in Fig. S1,† the peaks around 3667 cm−1, 1394 cm−1 and 670 cm−1 belong to the O–H vibration, the peaks around 2986 cm−1, 2897 cm−1 and 891 cm−1 belong to the C–H vibration, and the peaks around 1054 cm−1 and 1395 cm−1 belong to the C–O vibration and C–O stretching vibration of ethanol, respectively. The peaks at 2341 cm−1 and 2359 cm−1 are attributed to the CO vibration of CO2, which is commonly observed in some composites. From the above results we deduce that the SnO2 QDs are capped by organic groups and they cannot be removed from the ETL by annealing at 75 °C. Although the organic groups can maintain the stability of the SnO2 colloidal solution and enhance the homogeneity of the spin-coated ETL film, they increased the resistance of the ETL thus being unfavorable for its performance. Taking this into account, we used Fourier Transfer Infrared Spectrum analysis to compare the structural differences of the ETLs annealed at 100 °C, 130 °C, 150 °C and 180 °C for an hour, respectively. The results indicate that the absorption peak intensities of C–O, O–H, and C–H are substantially reduced by 180 °C annealing and this suggests that 180 °C is high enough to remove most of the organic groups thus obtaining an excellent SnO2 ETL.
According to the above results, we focus on revealing the optical and electrical properties of the Q-SnO2 ETL (Q-ETL) and N-SnO2 ETL (N-ETL) prepared at 180 °C, one was derived from the Q-SnO2 solution method and the other was from the traditional alcohol solution route.27Fig. 3(a) shows three linear sweep voltammetry curves of bare FTO, the Q-ETL, and the N-ETL. A smaller slope of the N-ETL implies inferior conductivity. By contrast, the Q-ETL and bare FTO have larger slopes and higher conductivity. Meanwhile, we also find that the Q-ETL has better optical performance than the N-ETL. The light transmittance spectra were measured, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The Q-ETL has higher transmittance than that of the N-ETL across the range of 350–800 nm. The comparison of transmittance between the above two ETLs suggests that the Q-ETL is competent as an anti-reflection layer on FTO, favorable for minimizing optical loss. We performed Hall effect measurements to obtain carriers of the Q-ETL, and N-ETL. The carrier densities of the N-ETL and Q-ETL are measured to be 4.2 × 1012 per cm3 and 5.6 × 1015 per cm3, respectively. Therefore the relatively higher carrier density of the Q-ETL is beneficial for its efficient electron extraction. The excellent performances of the QDs inspire us to fabricate PSCs using the ETLs prepared using the SnO2 QDs. Fig. 4(a) shows the device structure, wherein FTO is employed as the cathode, Q-SnO2 or N-SnO2 films as the ETLs, FA0.7MA0.3PbI3 as the absorber layer, spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL, and a gold layer as the anode. As has been noted in our previous work,39 the FTO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro/Au structure has an appropriate energy level alignment to facilitate smooth transport for carriers in the solar cells. The energy level diagram of SnO2 QD-based devices is given in Fig. 4(b).

In detail, we fabricated planar PSCs by depositing a layer of perovskite cation lead halide MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 as the light harvester on the Q-ETL and N-ETL with an extensively used anti-solvent method.40 Accordingly, the two types of ETLs as well as their corresponding PSCs are denoted as “Q-PSC” and “N-PSC”. The top SEM images of the Q-ETL and N-ETL on FTO/glasses are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), and it can be seen that both of the N-ETL and the Q-ETL are smooth and compact without any pinhole. The smooth surface of the two ETLs is favorable to grow the perovskite layer with large grains. The top SEM images of the Q-PSC and N-PSC are shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d). It is obvious that the two PSCs are composed of even grains and the average grain size of the Q-PSC is larger than that of the N-PSC. The cross-sectional image of the Q-PSC is shown in Fig. S2;† one can see that the thickness of the two PSCs is ∼460 nm, and the thickness of spiro-OmeTAD and Au top electrodes is 180 and 100 nm, respectively.

Solar cells were measured under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight. We fabricated an N-ETL by annealing at 180 °C for 1 hour and a planar PSC was fabricated on it according to the above process. The new PSC is denoted as N-PSC. The J–V curves are presented in Fig. 6(a) for the best performing planar Q-PSC and N-PSC under reverse and forward scan directions. The champion PCEs of the Q-PSC and N-PSC are 20.1% and 18.0%, respectively. Therefore, the performance of the Q-PSC is substantially enhanced compared with the N-PSC. We have also measured the stabilized power output data. The stabilized PCEs are 19.59% and 16.62% for the best performing devices. The stabilized current densities are 21.09 mA cm−2 and 20.86 mA cm−2 for the Q-PSC and N-PSC respectively and the insert of Fig. 6(a) presents the J–t curves. To confirm the reproducibility of the performance of the planar perovskite solar cells using the Q-ETLs and N-ETLs, we fabricated and measured 27 separate devices. The statistics of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE measured under reverse voltage scan and at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 are shown in Fig. S3.† The average efficiency for the 27 cells deposited on Q-ETLs is 18.8%, with a Voc of 1.08 V, Jsc of 23.4 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.74; the corresponding values are 17.5%, with a Voc of 1.09 V, Jsc of 22.6 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.70 for the N-PSCs. Except for the Voc, the average PCE, Jsc and FF of the Q-PSCs are larger than those of N-PSCs. The hysteresis factor is defined by the PCE under reverse scanning subtracts the PCE under forward scanning and then divided by the PCE under reverse scanning. The hysteresis factor of the Q-PSC and N-PSC is 22.3% and 12.2%, respectively. It is larger than those of some (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 or triple cation perovskite solar cells.41–43

(b) The J–V curves of the best performing planar Q-PSC and N-PSC under reverse and forward scan directions with the ETL decorated by C60-sam. 
There are complicated factors responsible for the hysteresis such as transient effects in measurement,44 ion (defect) migration,45 capacitive effect,46,47 perovskite/ETL interface polarization,48etc. In the present work, we suggested that the hysteresis is dominated by perovskite/ETL interface polarization. The electrons trapped in the perovskite/ETL interface may lead to interface polarization which results in relatively larger hysteresis for higher temperature (180 °C) annealed Q-SnO2. As the low temperature annealed ETL samples may contain some Cl− and OH−, the Cl may passivate the interface between SnO2 and the perovskite.40 Therefore, the devices present less hysteresis. On the other hand, the low temperature annealed SnO2 ETL should have fewer oxygen deficiencies and therefore lower carrier concentration and higher electron mobility. Therefore, higher mobility will induce better balanced carrier extraction. The low temperature annealed ETL will induce less hysteresis. In contrast, PSCs using the 180 °C annealed ETL present larger hysteresis because of higher oxygen vacancies and therefore higher carrier concentration and lower electron mobility.49
To reduce hysteresis, we decorated the Q-ETL and N-ETL with C60-sam. The detailed processing method is presented in the ESI.† The PCE under reverse and forward scan directions is 18.8% and 18.1% for the Q-PSC, respectively, and it is 15.9% and 15.2% for the N-PSC, respectively. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 6(b). The hysteresis factor of the Q-PSC and N-PSC is reduced to 4.7% and 4.4%, respectively. Therefore the hysteresis is reduced by decoration of C60-sam. The larger FF of the Q-PSC may be ascribed to the high carrier concentration and electrical conductivity of the Q-ETL. Fig. 7 shows the EQE and integrated current based on various ETLs. The EQE integrated current densities for the Q-PSC and N-PSC are 22.8 mA cm−2 and 21.79 mA cm−2, respectively. The integrated currents of the PSCs are in good agreement with the J–V measurement values.

The steady-state PL and time-resolved PL of the perovskite deposited on the Q-ETL, N-ETL and FTO were measured to study the electron extraction and transport mechanism. Fig. 8(a) shows the PL spectra of the FTO/perovskite, FTO/Q-ETL/perovskite, and FTO/N-ETL/perovskite samples. The FTO/perovskite shows the highest PL intensity, indicating the most intensive recombination in the sample. The FTO/Q-ETL/perovskite sample shows the lowest intensity, indicating more effective electron extraction. Fig. 8(b) displays the TRPL spectra of the same samples. The PL decay time and amplitudes are fitted using two decay time methods according to the reported method.50 The PL decay time is τ1 = 11.3 ns and τ2 = 266.1 ns for the FTO/perovskite. For the FTO/N-ETL/perovskite, τ1 increases to 30.7 and τ2 decreases to 162.0 ns. For the FTO/Q-SnO2/perovskite sample, τ1 increases to 43.2 and τ2 decreases to 147.6, respectively. The average decay time is 194.4 ns, 146.2 ns and 85.2 ns respectively, demonstrating that compared with the N-ETL, electrons can transfer into the Q-ETL from perovskite films more rapidly, as witnessed by stronger steady-state PL quenching in the N-SnO2 ETL or Q-ETL sample. The faster electron injection rate from the perovskite to the N-ETL is beneficial for the charge separation and effectively suppresses charge recombination at the perovskite/ETL interface, leading to higher Jsc and Voc values, in good agreement with the J–V and IPCE measurement.

The thickness of the ETL can affect the cell performance significantly. A too large thickness may lead to high series resistance, thus reducing the Jsc and FF of the cell, while a too small thickness may result in direct contact between the perovskite and FTO thus reducing the effectiveness of the ETL. To obtain an appropriate thickness of the Q-ETLs, we prepared four Q-ETLs on FTO/glass referring to our previous work.27 The four Q-ETLs were deposited using SnO2 colloidal solutions of 0.025 M, 0.05 M, 0.1 M and 0.2 M, respectively. The deposition method has been mentioned in the electron transform layer preparation part. The thickness increases with the SnO2 colloidal solution concentration. We found that the cell performance first increases and then decreases with the SnO2 colloidal solution (shown in Fig. S4†). The thicknesses of the four ETLs are ∼7.5 nm, 15 nm, 30 nm and 60 nm, respectively. The performance of the PSCs deposited on the above four ETLs is shown in Table S1.† It can be seen that the second one has the best performance, and therefore an appropriate thickness of the Q-ETL is suggested to be ∼30 nm. We also calculated the appropriate volume ratio of anhydrous alcohol to deionized water of various Q-SnO2 colloidal precursor solutions for the PSC performance. As noted above, the ratios of anhydrous alcohol to deionized water are 7:1, 5:1, 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3. The J–V curves of the champion performance are shown in Fig. S5.† We found that the cell performance first increases and then decreases as the ratio decreases. The performance of the PSCs deposited on the above three ETLs is shown in Table S2.† The ratio of the best photovoltaic performance is 5:1.
As noted above, although the organic group in the Q-ETL can be removed by annealing at a relatively high temperature of 180 °C, high temperature annealing also yields defects in ETLs thus promoting hysteresis, while the ethyl groups can also be removed by the UV–ozone process at room temperature. We reduced the ETL annealing temperature to 100 °C and prolonged the annealing time to 3 hours and the UV–ozone process time to an hour to prepare Q-ETLs first and then fabricated planar PSCs following the above procedures. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 9, and the champion PCEs of the PSC are 19.2% and 17.1% with reverse scanning and forward scanning, respectively. The hysteresis factor is reduced to 11.3% from 22.3% of the PSCs fabricated on the ETL annealed at 180 °C. This shows that low temperature annealing combined with the UV–ozone process can reduce defects thus obtaining an excellent SnO2 ETL with low defect densities. To reduce the hysteresis further, we decorated the SnO2 ETL annealed at 100 °C with C60-sam and two typical J–V curves under forward and reverse scanning are shown in Fig. 9. The hysteresis factor is reduced to 1.5%.
 Fig. 9  The J–V curves of the best performing PSC based on Q-ETLs annealed at 100 °C with/without C60-sam decoration under reverse and forward scan directions. 
We also fabricated 27 separate devices. The statistics of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of the PSCs deposited on the Q-ETL annealed at 100 °C are shown in Fig. S6.† The average PCE is 18.6% and it is comparable to the results of the PSCs deposited on the Q-ETL annealed at 180 °C. The average Voc, FF and Jsc are 1.08 V, 0.71 and 23.71, respectively. We deposited a Q-ETL on a PEN flexible substrate by annealing at 100 °C and the typical curves under reverse scanning and forward scanning are shown in Fig. S7.† The PCE is 14.6% and 10.9%, respectively. This demonstrates the possibility to fabricate Q-ETLs on flexible substrates.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a facile room-temperature process to reproducibly produce SnO2 QD ethanol solutions without using reflux or other assisting processes. We found that the amount of water added can significantly influence the performance of PSCs. Using the optimized SnO2 QD ETLs, we have fabricated double cation FAMA PSCs with PCE up to 20.1% under reverse scan. Additionally, our QD PSCs show high performance reproducibility within a wide temperature range from 100 to 200 °C. The device using the 100 °C heated QD ETL shows an average efficiency of 18.6%, which shows strong potential in low cost and flexible solar applications. Due to the low-temperature processability of the SnO2 QD ETL and with green ethanol solvent, it may also be suitable for ETLs in p–i–n inverted structure single junction or tandem PSCs on flexible substrates.
