, Accepted 24th July 2013First published on 25th July 2013AbstractA tetra-arylporphyrin dye was functionalized with three different anchoring groups used to attach molecules to metal oxide surfaces. The physical, photophysical and electrochemical properties of the derivatized porphyrins were studied, and the dyes were then linked to mesoporous TiO2. The anchoring groups were β-vinyl groups bearing either a carboxylate, a phosphonate or a siloxy moiety. The siloxy linkages were made by treatment of the metal oxide with a silatrane derivative of the porphyrin. The surface binding and lability of the anchored molecules were studied, and dye performance was compared in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Transient absorption spectroscopy was used to study charge recombination processes. At comparable surface concentration, the porphyrin showed comparable performance in the DSSC, regardless of the linker. However, the total surface coverage achievable with the carboxylate was about twice that obtainable with the other two linkers, and this led to higher current densities for the carboxylate DSSC. On the other hand, the carboxylate-linked dyes were readily leached from the metal oxide surface under alkaline conditions. The phosphonates were considerably less labile, and the siloxy-linked porphyrins were most resistant to leaching from the surface. The use of silatrane proved to be a practical and convenient way to introduce the siloxy linkages, which can confer greatly increased stability on dye-sensitized electrodes with photoelectrochemical performance comparable to that of the other linkers.
Introduction
Modification of metal oxide surfaces by attachment of molecules both raises interesting fundamental questions in interfacial science and leads to a variety of potential practical uses.1–5 A major application of current interest is in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),6–10 wherein molecular dyes are attached to the surface of a wide band gap, nanoparticulate semiconductor such as TiO2. Electron injection from the photoexcited dye into the semiconductor leads to current flow through an external circuit. The performance of such cells is greatly influenced by the properties of the dye–semiconductor interface, where events such as photoinduced electron transfer, charge recombination, electron transfer to and from redox mediators, dye quenching through aggregation, etc. occur. The nature of the binding between the dye and the metal oxide affects all of these processes in addition to the long-term stability of the surface attachment of the dye.
Carboxylic acids have been the most widely used functional group for attaching molecules to metal oxides for DSSCs.7 They are readily accessible both synthetically from the wide range of commercially available precursors, and as a common component of bio-derived materials. However, carboxylic acids are prone to dissociate from the metal oxide surface under some conditions, including exposure to aqueous and alkaline electrolytes.11 When the dye-sensitized electrode is used in cells for photochemical water oxidation and production of fuels such as hydrogen,12,13 or for reformation of biofuels to hydrogen,14–18 the lability of the carboxylic acid moiety is particularly troublesome. For this reason, and in attempts to achieve more control over electron transfer reactions across the molecule–oxide interface,19–24 a variety of other linker moieties have been investigated.25–27 Among these, phosphonic acids have been particularly popular. They bind more strongly to TiO2 and other metal oxides than do carboxylic acids.
Several years ago, we introduced the use of silatrane groups as a convenient way to link molecules to metal oxide surfaces via siloxyl bonds, and demonstrated their use in the construction of DSSCs (both aqueous and non-aqueous) with porphyrin and ruthenium sensitizers.28 Silatranes are triethanolamine-protected trialkoxysilanes,29 and are hypothesized to deprotect on metal oxide surfaces via nucleophilic attack by the surface hydroxyl groups on the silicon and subsequent removal of the protecting group, forming siloxyl-type surface linkages. Bi- or tri-dentate linkages are formed.30,31 These siloxyl linkages to TiO2 and other metal oxides are significantly less labile than the ester bonds formed by carboxylic or phosphonic acids.28,32 The use of the silatrane moiety to form such linkages avoids many of the difficulties associated with other methods33 of making these connections. Since our initial report, Latham and coworkers34 have investigated the performance of ruthenium dyes linked to metal oxides using siloxyl groups and also found significant advantages over more traditional linkers for conventional DSSCs.
Given our interest in porphyrins as sensitizers and in the use of dye-sensitized photoanodes in both aqueous electrochemical cells for fuel production and DSSCs for electricity production, we quantitatively compare the performance of siloxyl linkages formed by the silatrane method with other linkages in DSSC applications. Siloxyl linkages to metal oxides formed by different methods are not necessarily all identical. Some methods, for example, can lead to the formation of polymeric masses of siloxyl-linked material on the metal oxide surface, rather than simple monolayers. Here, we present the results of a comparison of the properties of electrode materials comprised of Zn(II)-5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-methylphenyl)porphyrin linked to nanoparticulate TiO2 via carboxylate, phosphonate or siloxyl linkages. The structures of the porphyrin sensitizers are shown in Fig. 1. In all cases, the attachment moiety was linked to the porphyrin macrocycle via a trans-vinyl group at a β-position. The short, conjugated vinyl group is expected to facilitate electron injection from the excited dye molecule into the oxide.19

The sensitizers were prepared using standard methods,19,35–37 and characterized by 1H-NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A discussion of the chemistry of silatrane groups was presented earlier.28 The details are given in the ESI.†
Characterization of sensitizers
The absorption spectra of Zn–TTP–COOMe, Zn–TTP–PO(OEt)2 and Zn–TTP–sil in dichloromethane solution are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption features are typical of zinc porphyrins, and include a strong Soret band in the 420 nm region and two Q-bands in the 525–625 nm region with smaller extinction coefficients. There is a slight dependence of the absorption maxima (6–8 nm) on the substituent (Table 1). The Zn–TTP–COOMe absorbs at the longest wavelength and Zn–TTP–sil at the shortest. The fluorescence spectra in dichloromethane (Fig. 3) are also typical of zinc tetra-arylporphyrins, and show similar shifts in emission maxima to those seen in the Q-bands (Table 1).

 Fig. 3  Fluorescence spectra in dichloromethane solution of Zn–TTP–COOMe (solid), Zn–TTP–PO(OEt)2 (dashes), and Zn–TTP–sil (dots). The spectra have been normalized at the highest peak. Excitation was in the Q-band region, with absorbance values of ∼0.05. 
Transient fluorescence measurements using the single photon timing method were performed on the same compounds in dichloromethane, with excitation into the Q-band region at 550 nm. Analysis of the decays gave satisfactory fits (χ2 < 1.14) of the sum of two exponential components. The major components had lifetimes (τs) of 1.3 ns for Zn–TTP–COOMe and Zn–TTP–PO(OEt)2, and 1.6 ns for Zn–TTP–sil. The minor components had time constants of 300–400 ps, and are ascribed to aggregation or minor impurities (ESI,† Fig. S1). These time constants are typical for zinc tetra-arylporphyrins.
The electrochemical properties of the model compounds Zn–TTP–COOMe, Zn–TTP–PO(OEt)2, and Zn–TTP–sil were determined by cyclic voltammetry in dichloromethane containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6), and the results are shown in Table 1. It is interesting to note that Zn–TTP–COOMe was more difficult to oxidize (Eox = +0.83 V vs. SCE) relative to Zn–TTP–PO(OEt)2 and Zn–TTP–sil, which had comparable redox potentials (0.73 and 0.75 V, respectively). From the electrochemical potential of oxidation (Eox) and excited-state energy (E0–0) values, the excited-state electrochemical potential (Eox*) was determined for each dye (Table 1).
Characterization of sensitizers on TiO2
Electrodes were prepared by deposition of ca. 3 μm transparent films of porous, nanoparticulate TiO2 on fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) coated glass as described in the ESI.† The Zn–TTP–COOH, Zn–TTP–PO3H2, and Zn–TTP–sil based sensitizers were attached to the TiO2 by soaking the electrodes in dilute (∼0.2 mM) solutions of the porphyrins in toluene at 90 °C for 1 h. The choice of solvent and temperature were based on the reactivity of Zn–TTP–sil, which undergoes deprotection and binding on the surface efficiently under these conditions. The sensitized electrodes were studied using several spectroscopic methods.
To analyze the bonding of the dyes on the metal oxide surface, the dye-sensitized electrodes were characterized by FT-IR-ATR spectroscopy. The spectra obtained were compared to the spectra of the non-bound dyes and model compounds. For the pure materials, a drop of solution containing the sensitizer was allowed to evaporate on the diamond surface of the spectrometer, and the spectrum of the resulting solid was obtained. The infrared spectra of the unbound porphyrin acids presented anomalies due to intermolecular interactions of the pure dyes in the solid state. These arose from interactions between the zinc and acid functionalities and among the acid functionalities themselves. For a better comparison of the key peaks associated with the carboxylate groups, the esters of the carboxylic and phosphonic acids were included in the analysis. The relevant spectral regions are shown in Fig. 4. For Zn–TTP–COOMe (Fig. 4a), the ester group has a prominent νas(CH3) peak at 1433 cm−1.38 The carbonyl stretch for Zn–TTP–COOMe is at 1720 cm−1. A lower-energy band at 1675 cm−1 has been observed in related systems, and is attributed to the carbonyl coordinating to zinc, which requires 5 ligands.39 The Zn–TTP–COOH shows only the lower energy CO stretch, and both Zn–TTP–COOH and Zn–TTP–COOMe show a peak near 1263 cm−1 which is attributed to C–O stretching.38 On TiO2, the peaks for the carbonyl and C–O stretching disappear, and a broad absorbance at 1385 cm−1 is visible. This is assigned to νs(COO−), and a new shoulder near the CC stretching peaks at 1621 cm−1 can be assigned to νas(COO−).40 The numerous IR bands present for molecular vibrations other than those involving the surface linker functional group were superimposed on the relevant peaks, making a complete characterization of surface linker bonding difficult. Strong absorbance near 1000 cm−1 from the vinyl group and pyrrole C–H vibrations, and at wavenumbers below 1000 cm−1 due to TiO2 were present for all measurements.31,38,41,42

(c) Zn–TTP–sil (top) and Zn–TTP–sil after bonding to TiO2 (bottom). All dye-sensitized TiO2 spectra were corrected by subtracting the bare TiO2 spectrum. 
Turning now to the phosphonic acid derivatives (Fig. 4b), the spectrum of Zn–TTP–PO(OEt)2 shows the PO stretch at 1230 cm−1, and also has characteristic phosphonate ester bands for P–O–C at 1053 cm−1 and 1026 cm−1.38,43 There is no PO stretch visible for Zn–TTP–PO3H2, which is likely due to strong intermolecular interactions similar to those observed for the carboxylic acid. A broad shoulder on the 1000 cm−1 band is characteristic of P–O–H stretching.44 When Zn–TTP–PO3H2 is attached to TiO2, one would expect phosphonate peaks relating to species such as the bidentate surface connection component R(OH)PO2− at 990–1250 cm−1. Such peaks have been observed for TiO2 between 1000 and 1100 cm−1.41,45,46 These bands could not be unambiguously identified due to the strong overlapping peak near 1000 cm−1. However, a decrease, but not disappearance, of the P–O–H shoulder band at energies below 1000 cm−1 was observed, and this, along with the disappearance of the PO stretch, is characteristic of a surface-bound interaction.
Silatranes have several distinctive vibrations in the infrared region relating to the triethanolamine cage, and these were observed in Zn–TTP–sil (Fig. 4c). Strong peaks at 1106 and 1124 cm−1 for ν(C–O) and a weaker band at 1452 for δ(CH2) are visible.47 Upon reaction with TiO2, the triethanolamine protecting group is removed and these peaks disappear. Bands for the expected surface connection Si–O–Ti at 910–960 cm−1 and from any condensed siloxyl species Si–O–Si at 1000–1100 cm−1 are masked by the strong, broad peak centered at around 1000 cm−1.30,38
The sensitized electrodes were also studied in air by UV-Visible spectrophotometry, and some results are shown in Fig. 5a. The electrode spectra are roughly similar to the spectra of the model compounds in solution (see Fig. 2 and Table 1). The Q-bands are slightly broadened on the electrodes, and shifted to longer wavelengths. The spectra in Fig. 5a reveal significantly greater light harvesting by electrodes bearing carboxylate porphyrins than those bearing porphyrins with phosphonate or siloxyl groups, which had similar absorbance to one another. The TiO2 layers on each of the three electrodes were similar, and of similar thickness, and the sensitizers are expected to have similar extinction coefficients. Thus, it can be concluded that the carboxylic acid-bearing electrode has a higher surface concentration of sensitizer than do the other dyes when all electrodes are prepared in the same way.

The spectra have been corrected by subtraction of the spectra of the bare TiO2 electrodes. The Soret band is truncated in order to highlight the Q-band region. (b) Photocurrent action spectra for DSSCs with TiO2 electrodes sensitized with Zn–TTP–COOH (solid), Zn–TTP–PO3H2 (dash), and Zn–TTP–sil (dots). The electrolyte solution consisted of 100 mM LiI, 50 mM I2, 650 mM 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, and 50 mM 4-t-butylpyridine in an 85:15 acetonitrile:valeronitrile solvent mixture. 
Transient absorption experiments were carried out on the electrodes in order to determine kinetic parameters for interfacial electron transfer. The TiO2 electrodes were prepared and sensitized as described above and then immersed in an electrolyte solution consisting of 100 mM LiClO4 and 50 mM 4-t-butylpyridine in an 85:15 mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile for analysis. The electrodes were photoexcited using a 5 ns laser pulse at 560 nm and the transient absorption was measured in the 600–780 nm region, where the porphyrin radical cations absorb. Electron injection into the metal oxide by the excited porphyrins was too fast to detect with the spectrometer used, and a transient absorbance characteristic of the porphyrin radical cation was detected promptly after excitation (ESI,† Fig. S2). The porphyrin radical cation decays were fitted satisfactorily as the sum of three exponential components, but this fitting may represent multi- or non-exponential processes. The data were fitted globally, and presented as evolution-associated difference spectra (EADS, Fig. S2, ESI†). The recombination time constants obtained from the EADS spectra ranged from tens to hundreds of μs, and are reported in Table 2, along with the relative amplitudes at 680 nm. The component lifetimes are similar for each sensitizer, but the percentages of those components differ. The shorter lifetime components dominate for the electrode sensitized with Zn–TTP–PO3H2, whereas the electrodes sensitized with Zn–TTP–COOH and Zn–TTP–sil show generally longer decay times.

DSSC performance
The dye-sensitized thin, porous TiO2 electrodes were used to prepare DSSC devices with an electrolyte containing the iodide–triiodide redox couple (see ESI†). The incident-photon-to-current-efficiency (IPCE) curves were measured (Fig. 5b). The shapes of the IPCE curves mimic the absorbance features of the porphyrin dyes shown in Fig. 2 and 5a, but display wavelength shifts due to solvation. The spectra in Fig. 2 were obtained in dichloromethane and those in Fig. 5a from electrodes soaked in toluene. The photocurrent at all wavelengths was significantly greater with the devices fabricated from the carboxylic acid derivative, relative to those prepared using the other sensitizers. Current vs. voltage plots were obtained for the cells with excitation from simulated AM1.5G 1000 W m−2 illumination (Fig. 6), and the device performance from all three types of cells is summarized in Table 3. These data show that the devices prepared with Zn–TTP–PO3H2 and Zn–TTP–sil performed in an almost identical manner, but the cell using Zn–TTP–COOH demonstrated more than twice the photocurrent density, leading to about twice the solar energy conversion efficiency (η). Fill factors (FF) for all devices were approximately the same.

These differences in performance noted in Table 3 suggest that the photocurrents correlate in some way with the light absorption by the electrodes (Fig. 5a). The roles of surface coverage and light harvesting in device performance were examined by preparing dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes with lower surface concentrations of Zn–TTP–COOH. Electrodes were soaked in the sensitizer solution as discussed above for times of 1 h, 8 min, and 5 min. Shorter electrode soaking times in the dye yielded Zn–TTP–COOH electrodes that absorbed less light (Fig. 7a). These electrodes were fabricated into DSSC devices and tested under conditions identical to those described above. As shown in Fig. 7b, the IPCE values decreased as the fraction of light absorbed decreased. Similarly, measurement of the current vs. voltage characteristics under simulated sunlight showed a trend to lower Jsc and Voc with a decrease in the fraction of light absorbed (data not shown). The data in Fig. 5 were used to calculate absorbed photon to current efficiencies (APCE) of 0.88 for Zn–TTP–PO3H2 and 0.91 for Zn–TPP–sil. A linear least squares fit to the absorbance data in the experiments in Fig. 7 passing through the origin gave an APCE value of 0.80 for Zn–TTP–COOH at a surface concentration similar to those of Zn–TTP–PO3H2 and Zn–TPP–sil in Fig. 5. These results suggest that within the error limits of our study, at identical surface concentrations of sensitizer, DSSC devices made from Zn–TTP–COOH would have similar performance to those prepared using Zn–TTP–PO3H2 or Zn–TTP–sil.

Surface linkage lability
As mentioned earlier, one of the drawbacks of carboxylate linkages to TiO2 is their desorption under aqueous and basic conditions. Therefore, the lability of the linkage between the dyes studied here and the TiO2 surface was examined by exposing the electrodes to alkaline conditions and evaluating any loss of sensitizer from the surface. The TiO2 electrodes were sensitized with the carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid, or silatrane porphyrins by soaking them in ∼0.2 mM toluene solutions of the sensitizer at 90 °C for 1 h, rinsing, and then placing them into a solution consisting of THF–methanol–0.5% aqueous Cs2CO3 (w/w) in a 10:5:2 ratio. The electrodes were soaked in the alkaline solution for 20 min, during which time the porphyrin surface attachment could be hydrolyzed and the molecule desorbed into solution. The absorbances of the electrodes before and after this treatment are shown in Fig. 8. Although much of the dye was removed under the strongly alkaline conditions, a clear trend was established. The siloxyl connections were less labile than phosphonate, which were in turn much less labile than carboxylate. In fact, the carboxylate porphyrin was removed in a matter of seconds whereas the others were more gradually leached from the electrode surface during the experiment.

(a) Electrode from Zn–TTP–COOH, (b) electrode from Zn–TTP–PO3H2, (c) electrode from Zn–TTP–sil. The spectra are of bare TiO2 (dots), the sensitized electrode before leaching (solid), and electrode after leaching (dashes). 
Another lability test under the same hydrolysis conditions was performed using electrodes which were sensitized by the method described previously, and then cured by heating at 80 °C for 1 h in a sensitizer-free solution of acetonitrile containing 0.6% water. The results are given in Fig. 9. The heating procedure increased the stability of all of the connections, but to different degrees. Most of the carboxylate surface connections were broken during the acetonitrile–water treatment. After alkaline treatment, only a very small fraction of the sensitizer remained on the surface. The phosphonate and siloxyl surface-connected porphyrins did not desorb during the acetonitrile–water treatment, and in both these cases, less porphyrin was removed by the alkaline solution than without the additional treatment. The silatrane preparation method gave the least labile surface attachment, as was true of the electrodes without heat treatment. In the case of the silatrane treatment, it is likely that the acetonitrile–water curing step helps fully deprotect the silatrane functional group and also provides additional time for multi-dentate- and cross-linkages to form. With the phosphonic acid sensitizer, the additional treatment may also foster the formation of multi-dentate linkages to the surface.

Discussion
Comparison of sensitizer properties
Comparison of the Zn–TTP–COOMe, Zn–TTP–PO(OEt)2, and Zn–TTP–sil model compounds provided intriguing trends and differences among them. The absorbance and fluorescence spectra in Fig. 2 and 3 show very small changes in the Soret and Q-band wavelengths with differences in extinction coefficients among the dyes within the experimental error (see Table 1). The changes in singlet energies (E0–0) are <20 meV. However, there is a somewhat more significant difference in the dye electrochemistry. The first oxidation potentials of Zn–TTP–PO(OEt)2 and Zn–TTP–sil are similar (0.73 V and 0.75 V vs. SCE, respectively), but Zn–TTP–COOMe is more difficult to oxidize by about 100 mV (0.83 V). These differences may be ascribed to the fact that the sp2 hybridized carbon of the carboxylate can demonstrate conjugative π–π overlap with the double bond of the vinyl group and the porphyrin π-electron system.20,21 The phosphonate and silatrane groups on the other hand cannot achieve such overlap, and the effects of these groups on porphyrin properties is therefore reduced. In this connection, tetra-aryl metalloporphyrins with β-vinyl substituents have previously been shown to demonstrate anodic shifts of their redox potentials and Q-band absorption shifts to longer wavelengths as the substituent becomes more electron withdrawing.19 This supports the existence of electronic overlap between the vinyl group and the porphyrin macrocycle.
The fluorescence lifetimes of Zn–TTP–COOMe and Zn–TTP–PO(OEt)2 are 1.3 ns in dichloromethane, and that of Zn–TTP–sil is 1.6 ns (Table 1). This small difference shows that the excited singlet states of the three sensitizers have similar times available for electron injection into the semiconductor before relaxation.
Surface bonding of functional groups
The linkage connecting a sensitizer to the surface is important from the point of view of effects on interfacial electron transfer reactions, surface geometry and packing, sensitizer electronic properties, and attachment lability. These effects in turn are affected by the electronic properties of the linker atoms and the type of bonding to the metal oxide. Fig. 10 shows the various types of bonding that have been postulated for carboxylates, phosphonates and siloxyl groups on metal oxide surfaces. When allowed to react with the metal oxide surface, carboxylic acid and phosphonic acids are thought to undergo condensation reactions with the surface hydroxyl groups to give ester-type linkages.39,45 Silatranes are hypothesized to deprotect on metal oxide surfaces via nucleophilic attack by the surface hydroxyl groups on the silicon, forming siloxyl-type surface linkages. The specific binding mode of each functional group depends on the experimental conditions and the metal oxide species due to the various bond stabilities and metal oxide lattice structures. For carboxylate groups, bidentate connections have been shown to be the preferred binding mode on TiO2.19,39,40 For phosphonates there is evidence for both bi- and tridentate linkages, with bidentate theoretically determined to be the most stable on crystalline TiO2 lattices.45,46,48–50 Trialkoxysilane and silatrane connections may also be bi- or tridentate, with bidentate attachment also theoretically preferred on TiO2.30,31 For siloxyl linkages, dangling –OH groups in the bidentate configurations are capable of undergoing intermolecular condensations to yield Si–O–Si bonds, making the surface linkage possibilities even more diverse. Phosphonates do not cross-link in this manner.51
 Fig. 10  Surface bonding schemes for carboxylate (left), phosphonate (middle), and siloxyl (right) linkages. 
The FT-IR-ATR results shown in Fig. 4 provide information on the possible surface bonding schemes shown in Fig. 10. In the case of Zn–TTP–COOH on TiO2, there was no observable CO stretch and new bands for COO− appeared. These results are consistent with the bidentate connection, and bidentate connections have been observed in carboxylic acid bearing ruthenium polypyridyl complexes, porphyrins, and other dyes on TiO2.40,45,52,53 The spectra of Zn–TTP–PO3H2 and Zn–TTP–sil on TiO2 are less informative. Due to the multiple porphyrin IR bands and the strong absorbance of TiO2 below 1000 cm−1, bands consistent with phosphonate linkages (P(OH)O2− and PO32−) and siloxyl linkages (Si–O–Ti and Si–O–Si) could not be verified. For the phosphonate-bearing electrodes, complete loss of PO and a decrease in P–O–H stretching bands suggest a multi-dentate surface binding. Other studies of phosphonic acid and phosphonates on TiO2 have shown the likelihood of both di- and tri-dentate surface connections, with bidentate seemingly preferred.45,46,49 Theoretical studies of phosphonic acid monolayers on anatase TiO2 showed similar binding combinations possible.48,54,55 For the silatrane studied here, disappearance of the triethanolamine IR bands demonstrate that the silatrane has been deprotected, but it is unknown whether mono-, bi-, or tri-dentate surface bonding configurations were formed. During the deprotection, surface Ti–OH groups are hypothesized to displace triethanolamine, forming Ti–O–Si connections. However, surface-adsorbed H2O could also play a role and leave dangling Si–OH bonds that could later condense to form intermolecular Si–O–Si bonds. Experimental and theoretical studies of related trialkoxysilane reactions on TiO2 suggest that bidentate bonding and Si–O–Si condensations are most probable.30,31 Dissociative binding, wherein each surface connection between titania and a functional group oxygen involves a separate titanium atom (Fig. 10) was determined to be the most stable configuration for all surface linkers in the cited studies.
It is interesting to note that in our experiments, the surface coverage by the carboxylic acid sensitizer was about twice as high as was achieved with either the phosphonic acid or silatrane derivatives. Longer treatment times did not significantly alter this ratio, and other studies have shown that porphyrins bearing carboxylic acid linkers in other positions achieve monolayer coverage in ∼1 h, even at ambient temperatures. Phosphonate bonds to the TiO2 surface are stronger than those formed by carboxylic acids, so it is assumed that monolayer coverage is achieved with the Zn–TTP–PO3H2 treatment as well. One possible reason for the differences in behavior is that the sensitizers bound with phosphonate and siloxy linkages may have a greater area requirement on the TiO2 surface. All three sensitizers have short, relatively rigid linkages to the metal oxide. Previous studies56 have shown that in the case of the sp2-hybridized carbon in the carboxylate sensitizers, bidentate binding allows rigidly attached moieties to achieve surface conformations in which the plane of the porphyrin is more or less perpendicular to the oxide surface. On the other hand, the sp3 hybridization at phosphorus in phosphonates and bidentate binding result in an angle of 66° for rigidly attached groups. It has been hypothesized that the smaller angle for phosphonates interferes with sensitizer packing on the surface and results in a greater area requirement per molecule.56,57 The short, rigid linkage between the porphyrin and phosphonate in the sensitizer studied here likely leads to similar behavior. The siloxyl silicon of Zn–TTP–sil is also sp3 hybridized, and similar packing effects may come into play in this case. This explanation for the reduced surface coverage of the phosphonic acid- and silatrane-based sensitizers is bolstered by the fact that previous work on tin oxide employing a longer, flexible linkage between porphyrin and surface-binding group showed nearly identical surface coverage for silatrane and carboxylate groups.28
Performance of sensitizers in DSSCs
The experiments employing sensitized TiO2 electrodes were designed to allow comparison of linker effects on the DSSC system, rather than to maximize cell performance. To this end, thin, transparent electrodes were all prepared and evaluated in the same manner for the DSSC and transient absorption measurements.
Relevant properties were found to be comparable for the three porphyrins, and amenable for use in a standard DSSC design employing TiO2 and the iodide–triiodide redox couple. The extinction coefficients of the sensitizing porphyrins are nearly equal, as are their excited singlet state lifetimes. These lifetimes are orders of magnitude larger than electron injection time constants in similar systems.58 The excited state oxidation potentials of all three sensitizers were well above the conduction band potential of anatase TiO2 at −0.90 V vs. SCE,59 ensuring ample driving force for electron injection. Likewise, all three sensitizers in the oxidized state should be thermodynamically capable of reduction by the iodine–iodide redox couple in solution.60,61 Similar porphyrins with different linkages to TiO2 have shown good performance in DSSCs using the same redox couple.62 The transient absorption studies of the electrodes showed that all three sensitizers demonstrated recombination lifetimes for surface-to-dye electron transfer in the μs range. However, the phosphonate showed somewhat faster recombination than the others.
Turning now to the performance of the DSSCs, the results (Fig. 5b and 6, Table 3) show that the cells with electrodes prepared from Zn–TTP–PO3H2 and Zn–TTP–sil gave essentially identical results, while the cells with Zn–TTP–COOH sensitization gave about 2.3 times the photocurrent, with similar fill factors and comparable Voc values. The carboxylic acid derived electrodes have a light harvesting efficiency about 1.4 times that of the other two electrodes in the Q-band region. These results suggest that the increased performance of the carboxylic acid derived electrodes is due to increased light absorption. This conclusion is supported by the data in Fig. 7, where the performance of electrodes prepared with Zn–TTP–COOH to yield different surface concentrations was compared. These studies allow one to conclude that when electrodes with the three different sensitizer linkages are prepared with the same surface concentration of sensitizer, the performance is comparable. Thus, under the conditions of these experiments, all three porphyrin molecules behave essentially identically in terms of photoelectrochemical performance, but the surface coverage achieved with Zn–TTP–COOH is about twice that obtained with the other linkers.
The photoelectrochemical performance of the sensitizers correlates in the 400–475 nm region with surface coverage (Fig. 5b), even though all three cells absorb essentially all the incident light at these wavelengths (Fig. 5a). The same phenomenon is seen with the carboxylic acid derived electrodes alone in Fig. 7. A possible explanation for this effect is that because the cells were irradiated from the exterior side of the sensitized electrode (the side not bearing the TiO2 layer), the light reaching the TiO2 layer was absorbed closer to the underlying FTO substrate with the more strongly absorbing electrodes than with the others. Electrons migrating to the FTO have less probability of recombination with oxidized sensitizer molecules or reaction with electron mediators prior to collection at the FTO. This is due to both the shorter transit time and the higher surface density of dye molecules, which limits access of the electrolyte to the TiO2.
Dye lability on electrode surface
The results in Fig. 8 and 9 demonstrate that the carboxylate linkage to TiO2 is reactive towards hydrolysis and this is especially the case under alkaline conditions. The phosphonate is less labile, and the siloxyl linkage is the least labile of the three. Heat curing of the electrodes increases the stability of all of the dyes on the surface, but the same trend in lability was observed. Previous studies of a variety of sensitizers linked to metal oxides have shown that phosphonates and siloxyl linkages are more stable and less labile than those formed by carboxylic acids.11,28,45,63–65 Contrary to the results found here, several of these other studies have reported greater stability for phosphonate linkages to metal oxides than for siloxyl linkages. However, these other studies dealt with different silylating species and in several cases different metal oxide substrates, and this may explain the differences in behavior. The increased stability of the siloxyl and phosphonate linkages after heat treatment may reflect formation of a larger proportion of multidentate attachments to the metal oxide, and in the case of the silatranes, greater formation of crosslinks to other sensitizer molecules via Si–O–Si bonds.
Conclusions
In summary, these studies have shown that porphyrin sensitizers bearing β-vinyl substituents with carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid, or silatrane moieties have similar photophysical properties. Electrochemical studies of the three dyes show that the potential for oxidation of the porphyrin is 100 mV more positive for the carboxylic acid derivative than for the other two derivatives. All three molecules can be attached to nanoparticulate anatase TiO2 by soaking in an appropriate solvent, but about twice the surface coverage is obtained with the carboxylic acid, relative to the other two linker groups. This may be due to differences in the geometry of the anchoring groups on the oxide surface. In DSSCs, Voc and FF are comparable for all three linkers, but the short-circuit current and solar conversion efficiency of the cell with the carboxylic acid linked sensitizer are about twice those observed with the phosphonic acid and silatrane linkers. Thus the photoelectrochemical parameters for all three sensitizers are comparable, but the carboxylic acid bearing sensitizer gives about twice the solar conversion efficiency because of the increased surface coverage. This is due to increased light absorption, absorption closer to the electrode FTO conducting surface and increased surface passivation. On the other hand, the carboxylate linkage is readily hydrolyzed, especially under basic conditions, resulting in loss of the sensitizer from the surface. Phosphonate linkages are much less labile, and the siloxyl linkages derived from the silatrane treatment are the most resistive to hydrolysis under the conditions examined here. Such resistance to cleavage is important for long term stability of DSSCs, and especially for photoelectrochemical cells with aqueous electrolytes that are used for light-powered water oxidation and fuel production. The silatrane precursor for introducing siloxyl linkages to metal oxides is particularly advantageous from the point of view of synthesis and processing, as it is stable to many common synthetic reaction conditions and to silica gel chromatography.28 Sensitizers with strong, especially stable linkages to TiO2 have been introduced, whose photoelectrochemical performance is comparable to that of other linkage moieties.
