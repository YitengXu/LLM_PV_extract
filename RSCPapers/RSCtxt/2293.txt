    First published on 17th February 2021AbstractEthene is a commodity chemical of great importance for manufacturing diverse consumer products, whose synthesis via crude oil steam cracking is one of the most energy-intensive processes in the petrochemical industry. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane is an attractive, low energy, alternative route to ethene which could reduce the carbon footprint for its production, however, the commercial implementation of ODH requires catalysts with improved selectivity. This review critically assesses recent developments in catalytic technologies for ethane ODH, and discusses how insight into proposed mechanisms from computational studies, and CO2 assisted ethane dehydrogenation (CO2-DHE), provide opportunities for economically viable processes to meet growing demands for ethene while reducing carbon emissions. Future trends and emerging technologies for ethane ODH are also discussed.

1. Introduction
Short chain C2–C4 olefins are essential commodity chemicals employed as building blocks in the industrial production of a wide range of solvents, bulk and specialty chemicals, and polymers.1,2 Olefin production is largely by naphtha steam cracking3–5 and fluidised catalytic cracking (FCC) processes,6–9 which necessitate additional costly separations and purifications to reach the desired product specifications.10–14 Increased global olefin demand, coupled with environmental and economic issues associated with current processes,15,16 and the availability of C2–C3 alkanes from shale gas liquids,17 is driving the search for alternative routes to the direct production of alkenes from alkanes.18,19,20
Ethane is the second most abundant constituent of natural and shale gas,21 and a valuable feedstock for ethene generation.22,23 Ethene is one of the most important building blocks in the global petrochemical industry, with ∼80% of ethene finding application in commercially important chemicals24 including ethyl benzene, vinyl acetate, ethene oxide, linear higher olefins, and polymers such as polyethene and polyvinylchloride (PVC) (Fig. 1).25–28 Ethene is also a key raw material for synthetic lubricants, plasticisers surfactants and detergents, which play an important role in modern life.

Ethene market growth is ∼3% per annum,29,30 with the USA and China the largest producers (Fig. 1a). Compared to other petrochemicals, ethane supply and demand has not suffered during global economic recession. Global ethene consumption was >140 million metric tons (MMT) in 2016, and is expected to rise to >200 MMT by 2020, with production capacities of 185 MMT in 2019. The Chinese market will continue to grow at 8–10% annually for at least the next 5 years, driven by ethene consumption in polyethene and ethene glycol for the packaging, fibre and plastic industries (Fig. 1b).
The selective oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a promising alternative route to olefins,31–36 exploiting cheap ethane or propane27,37,38 from natural39 or shale gas.40–43 In contrast to non-oxidative dehydrogenation (eqn (1)), which is endothermic and thermodynamically unfavourable, ODH (eqn (2)) is favoured by the co-production of H2O. C2H6 → C2H4 + H2 ΔH298 = 136 kJ mol−1(1) (2) (3)Hydrogen combustion (eqn (3)) shifts the reaction towards ethene production and provides the energy for ethane dehydrogenation. Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (eqn (1)) typically operates at 550–700 °C and low (atmospheric) pressure, achieving only 10 to 40% conversion,44 whereas ethane ODH (eqn (2)) has a lower energy demand enabling 350–600 °C operation.16 The main energy savings for alkane ODH stem from the ability to operate under autothermal conditions,45–47 which reduces external heat requirements.48 Unlike current thermal or steam cracking catalysts, which require frequent extensive regeneration, carbon deposits formed over ODH redox catalysts are readily removed in situ by oxygen in the reactant feed.48,50,51
Operation under oxidative conditions thus not only lowers the thermodynamic barrier to dehydrogenation, but also minimises coke formation to improve catalyst lifetime.52 However, ethane combustion to COx and H2O (Scheme 1) is also thermodynamically favoured under oxidative conditions, and industrial production of ethene via ethane ODH has been hampered by poor catalyst selectivity.53

Ethane ODH involves three competing main reactions: the selective ODH of ethane to desired ethene (R1), total oxidation of ethane to CO2(R2) and consecutive oxidation of reactively formed ethene to CO2(R3). Formation of the thermodynamically favoured combustion products (CO2, CO and H2O) is difficult to inhibit, and hence ethene yields over most catalysts are low. A successful catalyst for ethane ODH must selectively produce ethene while suppressing total oxidation of ethane and ethene to COx.55 There is growing interest in the use of CO2 as a “soft oxidant” for ODH, which offers several advantages, including (i) inhibition of deep oxidation of the alkane and improved olefin selectivity, (ii) enhanced equilibrium conversion by removing hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, (iii) reduced coke formation, and (iv) mitigation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.56,57
Ethane ODH can occur ≥350 °C under isothermal or auto-thermal conditions in fixed, fluidised, monolithic or membrane reactors.53,58–61 Compared to conventional cracking processes (Fig. 2), fewer separation units are required in ODH, minimising by-products and energy demand.62 Therefore, the development of improved catalytic materials for ODH63–66 could have a significant impact on the chemical industry by enabling these inherently more efficient processes to be adopted.67,68 The importance of reactor type and process configuration for alkane selective oxidation has been reviewed in detail elsewhere,69 with the use of fluidised bed technology recommended for more efficient heat removal.

The application of group IA and IIA metal13 compounds and vanadium-containing redox oxides,70 has been extensively reviewed for alkane ODH, encompassing unsupported and supported vanadates, solid solutions, and mixed phase catalysts. Some key catalyst design features for the oxidative functionalisation of light alkanes and paraffins have also been discussed, with a focus on maleic anhydride formation via n-butane oxidation over vanadium oxide catalysts.71 A survey of supported vanadium oxides reveals their acid–base properties and V5+ coordination impacts on the C2–C4 alkane ODH activity and selectivity.72 Ethene and propene selectivity correlate with reducibility of the supported redox metal oxide, being greatest for less reducible redox metal ions operating at temperatures >550 °C.73 The role of reducible or non-reducible oxides in ODH is reviewed in detail by Bañares,37 with non-reducible oxides less active for ODH, requiring dopants and higher reaction temperatures to effect C–H activation (where gas phase radical contributions become significant). Special attention to the redox properties of transition metal oxides and the extent of radical-type homogeneous reactions over non-reducible metal oxide catalysts has also been considered.74
Mechanistic aspects of ODH of C2–C4 alkanes over nickel molybdate,75 and ODH over light paraffins using Ni–Co-molybdates76 and Mg–V–Sb-oxides,76 have also been discussed. The potential of CO2 as a mild oxidant during catalytic ethane ODH was outlined in a review on the oxidative and non-ODH of paraffins.77 To develop improved ODH catalysts, insight from mechanisms in organometallic catalysis can be sought, and reviews of low temperature C–H and C–C bond activation of saturated hydrocarbons draw analogies between mechanisms over metal complexes and supported catalysts.78 In this regard, a detailed review of hydrocarbon oxidation on transition metals using molecular oxygen has provided useful insight into the relative performance of transition metal oxides in alkane ODH.79 The kinetics of C2–C4 alkane ODH over various metal oxide based catalysts, and consideration of the origin of reactive oxygen species through Mars–van Krevelen redox models, has also been assessed.38 Kinetic studies of propane and ethane ODH over supported molybdenum and vanadium oxide catalysts80 have explored the impact of reactor configuration on selectivity, and homogeneous contributions to oxidation reactions. With optimum catalyst formulation and reactor design, ethene yields from ethane ODH are comparable to those from steam cracking. More recent reviews have offered great insight about reaction pathways for C–H activation during oxidative16 and non-oxidative20 dehydrogenation on different metal oxide catalysts, and the impact of reactor design. However, zeotype catalysts and their metal doped variants, which are emerging as promising materials for ethane ODH,81,82 are not discussed.
The past decade has seen many catalyst types investigated for ethane ODH, including alkali, alkaline-earth, rare-earth or transition metal oxides, phosphates or chlorides, and some ternary or quaternary mixed oxides. The role of the support is key in controlling catalyst performance,83–86 and therefore an updated review of recent developments that categorises classes of supported ODH catalyst formulations is required. This review presents an overview of catalysts reported for ethane ODH since 2000. Three subcategories of metal oxides are considered: (i) reducible, including mixed oxides containing transition metals; (ii) non-reducible, including rare-earth, alkali, alkaline and halide-doped oxides; and (iii) noble metal oxides. The second category mainly comprises zeolites, aluminophosphates (AlPOs) and silicoaluminophosphates (SAPOs). The impact of acidity, redox properties, different oxygen species, catalyst morphology during reaction, and support interactions are discussed. Insight from computational studies regarding reaction mechanisms over different catalysts are also presented, with the influence of catalyst type on the reaction pathways discussed. Finally, conclusions and future perspectives for research are presented which consider the sustainability of catalytic materials and use of alternative oxidants and processes for ethene production.
2. Mixed metal oxides
Bulk metal oxide catalysts are widely utilised in the chemical industry to synthesise chemical products via selective oxidation.87,88 Mixed oxide materials are particularly effective for selective oxidations due to their desirable acid–base and redox properties, and lattice defects.89–94 The catalytic performance of bulk and mixed metal oxides is dictated by their surface structural and electronic properties, with exposed crystal facets, particle size, morphology, coordination environment, composition and oxidation states all important parameters. Various models have been advanced to account for structure–performance relationships of bulk and mixed oxide materials,95 in which synergistic effects96 are invoked wherein: (i) dopants tune surface properties or induce phase changes; (ii) new bifunctional mechanisms operate at the interface between two phases; and (iii) active sites in one phase are generated via oxygen spillover from another phase.96Table 1 summarises the historical evolution of concepts in selective oxidation:95 (i) the catalytic performance of mixed oxides depends on the MO bond properties in bulk oxides, implying this is the catalytically active site; (ii) active site isolation is a prerequisite for the occurrence of the selective oxidation reactions; (iii) surfaces of mixed oxides have bifunctional properties, with O2 decomposition taking place on one component and C–H bond cleavage via oxygen insertion occurring on the other;95 (iv) the contact potential generated at the interface of the two phases, tunes the electron density of the first active phase to boost performance;92,95 and (v) synergy between an acceptor phase responsible for hydrocarbon functionalisation and a donor phase which spills over activated oxygen rapidly to the acceptor phase accelerates selective oxidation (so called remote control concept).95,98

None of these early concepts advanced explicit knowledge regarding the nature of the surface sites of mixed oxide materials, and only considered structures based on ideal terminations of bulk crystallographic planes. Recent application of operando spectroscopies and advanced surface characterisation methods, including low-energy ion scattering to probe surface outer layers, depth profiling by energy resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared (IR) spectroscopy of adsorbed methanol to probe different cationic sites, aberration-corrected high resolution and high-angle annular dark-field imaging scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and temperature programmed surface reactions, have proven invaluable in providing fundamental insight into the outermost surface of oxides to explain their catalytic behaviour.95 Applying these methods, the impact of dopants on stabilising unique surface facets has been observed and correlated with catalyst performance.99 The catalytic performance of various (mixed) metal oxides in ethane ODH is presented in Table S1 (ESI†), with the following sections illustrating the impact of electronic and structural properties for significant examples.
2.1 Reducible mixed metal oxides

2.1.1 Mixed oxides of V and Mo. 
Vanadium and molybdenum are extensively used as the main elements in mixed oxide catalysts developed for hydrocarbon selective oxidation.100–105 VOx species (Fig. 3) are key components to promote bifunctional catalysis in binary, ternary and quaternary mixed oxides.71,72 The versatility of vanadium-containing oxides in oxidation catalysis results from the readiness with which they change oxidation state and coordination environment during redox cycles, which can be tuned by other elements.106–114 The coordination polyhedra for various V–O framework species are illustrated in Scheme 2, according to their oxidation state and coordination number.115,116 Conversion from tetrahedral (T) to trigonal bipyramid (TB) and square pyramid (SP) structures is accompanied by the formation of two or one VO(vanadyl) bond(s) respectively. This metamorphosis occurs via two chains of corner-sharing tetrahedral VO3 units combining to form a V2O6 double chain as shown for T + T transforming to TB and SP structures. Formation of V2O5 gives rise to SP coordination with only one terminal VO bond, while octahedral and distorted octahedral frameworks result from the formation of a new weak V–O bond at the base of the TB and SP structures. The structure of immobilised VOx clusters is support dependent, owing to preferential stabilisation of different polyhedra and perturbation of redox properties.118–121 Hence, the synthesis method for preparing V containing oxides is critical for achieving exposure of the desired most active crystal facets.102

The activity of γ-Al2O3 supported Ti, V, Mo and Nb oxides, prepared by a molecular layering approach,122 revealed ethene yield was dependent on the thickness of Ti and V oxide films. Materials comprising 3 layers of TiO2 plus 3 layers of VOx (3Ti3V) exhibited the highest ethene selectivity. Nb-doping of 3Ti3V with an atomic Ti:V:Nb ratio of 1:0.76:0.21 led to a synergistic effect and a 35% increase in ethene yield. Mo doping of V2O5/Al2O3 using MPA (molybdophosphoric acid) enhanced the interaction between Mo and V oxides (Fig. 4),113 improving ethane ODH performance relative to impregnated and physical mixtures of oxides; the latter showing low ODH selectivity.

In general V-containing oxides are more selective and have nearly four times the activity of Mo-containing oxides,100 and are readily activated via a redox process upon interaction with ethane at 400 °C. In contrast, MoOx shows poor activity at such low temperatures, however its catalytic efficiency can be dramatically promoted by a small percentage of V (e.g. as Mo11V). This enhancement is proposed to originate from the formation of distinct θ-Mo5O14 clusters formed from MoO3 in the presence of low levels of V123 (Fig. 5).31

Doping of supported VOx with a range of transition metal elements including Ni, Cr, Nb, Mo124 and Sb125 has been widely explored for ethane ODH. Although a slight increase in ethene selectivity is reported for Ni, Cr, Nb and Mo, activity largely tracked catalyst specific surface area, with only Cr and Nb exhibiting increased activity.124 For Sb doped systems, promotion was associated with enhanced availability of active oxygen species and their efficiency for redox chemistry. When compared to pure VOx, alumina supported V–Sb oxides also exhibit lower coke formation and higher on-stream stability.125 Attempts to produce more complex VMoMnW mixed oxide catalysts resulted in phase separation and the formation of Mo6V9O40, VWO and MoO3, with a detrimental impact on activity.106 Amorphous phases and/or lattice defects are believed to significantly contribute to catalytic activity. For low W concentrations, active sites are suggested to reside at interfacial defects between WOx and other oxides. For high W loadings (>1 atom%), surface deposited WOx species may block active centres, suppressing ethane conversion, but with concomitant promotion of ethene selectivity.106


2.1.2 Ternary and quaternary mixed oxides of V and Mo. 
Doping of VMo-mixed oxides with Nb was particularly beneficial in promoting ODH activity, with Mo–V–Nb mixed oxides operating at lower reaction temperatures of 300–400 °C. The amount of Mo5+ and V4+ in Mo–V–Nb (plausible active sites in ethane ODH) can be regulated by changing the catalyst composition or thermal treatment. Samples pre-treated at 425 °C under N2 (rather than air) show superior ethene yields, with optimum performance for MoV0.6Nb0.12 at 400 °C, which exhibits a 13% ethene yield at 22% ethane conversion. This enhancement was attributed to an increase in Mo5+ species, which perturbs V and Nb ions;127 V5+ species are active for ethane activation in both Nb- free and Nb-containing materials, however Nb doping enhances surface areas and hinders MoO2 formation, thereby increasing selectivity to ethene.127
Further studies of thermally treated V–Mo–Nb oxides prepared with Mo5O14-like structures128 revealed materials calcined at 400 °C or 650 °C were active for ethene production or ethane deep oxidation respectively. XRD and EXAFS evidenced a nanocrystalline phase with V:Nb ≈ 1 after low temperature calcination which was active for ODH; higher temperatures converted this nanocrystalline oxide into solid solutions of (Mo0.6VzNb0.4−z)5O14 (0 ≤ z ≤ 0.2). Nanostructured MoV0.3–0.4Nb0.37–0.27Oy offers the best performance for ethane ODH, attributed to enhanced oxygen mobility within the disordered matrix of MO6 octahedra arising from in-plane distortions, sample defects, and/or the existence of “intercrystalline boundaries”.128
Metal cation incorporation into hydrothermally synthesised Mo–V–X–O (X = Al, Ga, Bi, Sb, Te)102,106,111,123 mixed oxides has also been explored. Mo–V–X–O catalysts were classified according to the incorporated metal cation.102 When X is Al, Ga or Bi, materials are active for ethane oxidation to acetic acid, whereas when X is Sb or Te they are very active for ODH. All catalysts were rod-shaped crystalline materials, however the extent of clustering of octahedrally coordinated V in the superstructure of Sb or Te doped catalysts was greater than that for Al doped catalysts; a property proposed to influence activity and selectivity for selective alkane oxidation.102 Selective ethane oxidation over hydrothermally synthesised Mo–V–X–O materials with X = Al, Ga or Fe is also reported.111 Addition of (C2H5)3NHCl during synthesis enhanced ethane conversion and selectivity towards acetic acid due to formation of rod-shaped crystals. Ethane ODH is preferred when low coordination VOx species are present (Scheme 3), whereas partial oxidation reactions require O-insertion and are favoured by higher coordination sites.97 Maximising ethene productivity necessitates to control over the surface termination of VOx containing crystallites to increase the proportion of low coordination sites.111,129

Mixed oxides of Mo–V–Sb have attracted significant attention for ethane ODH,107,125 with 75% ethene selectivity reported at 17% ethane conversion over Mo6V2SbOx at 380 °C.130 The intrinsic activity of Sb-containing Mo–V–X–O catalysts was higher than for other dopants such as Al, Bi or Ga. Synergy between Mo–V–O and α-Sb2O4 was claimed to influence yield, selectivity and conversion in ethane ODH. XPS analysis could not identify Mo4+ species before or after catalytic tests when Mo–V–O was mixed with α-Sb2O4, in contrast to Mo–V–O catalysts alone wherein extensive reduction to Mo4+ was observed. This indicates that α-Sb2O4 limits reduction of the Mo–V–O surface, possibly due to oxygen spillover to Mo sites.96 Thermal activation conditions also modify the performance of Sb-containing catalysts,107 which requires the formation of (SbO)2M20O56 (M = Mo, V) phases at 550–600 °C under N2; destruction of this crystalline phase and partial oxidation of surface Sb3+ to Sb5+ suppresses oxidation activity.
The use of additional promoters with Mo–V–Nb, such as Sb and Ca to form Mo0.62V0.26Nb0.07Sb0.04Ca0.01, was reported by Union Carbide.118,123,131 Ethene yields >50% at 400 °C were the best reported for a mixed oxide at that time.101 This discovery stimulated much research into such mixed oxides, with Mo–V–X mixed oxide catalysts (where X = Nb, Te, Sb or a mixture of these dopants) of great interest due to their multiphase nature103 and ability of dopants to stabilise selective crystalline phases and alter catalyst reducibility.101 Mo–V–Te–Nb mixed oxides show exceptional activity and selectivity for ethane ODH, with activation under N2 at 600–650 °C resulting in ethene yields ∼75%.108,131 This performance is attributed to the presence of an orthorhombic M1 phase with general formula (AO)2−2x(A2O)xM20O56 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1, A = Te, Sb and M = Mo, V and Nb).108,109,118 The orthorhombic (SbO)2M20O56 phase, isomorphous to Te2M20O57, also exhibits excellent selectivity for ethane ODH.107 The main oxidation states in these catalysts are V5+/V4+, Mo6+/Mo5+, Nb5+, Te4+ or Sb3+, although the average oxidation state decreases during thermal activation from 450–600 °C.101
The method of synthesising Te-containing Mo–V–Nb mixed oxides has a significant impact on ethane ODH activity.118 Catalysts fabricated by hydrothermal synthesis, and thermally treated at 600 °C under N2, exhibit ethane conversion and ethene selectivity >80% at 340–400 °C. This performance was attributed to a Te2M20O57 (M = Mo, V, Nb) crystalline phase, and elimination of unselective phases, notably MoO2. A highly active and selective MoVTeNbOx catalyst is also produced by 500 °C calcination, yielding 87% ethene selectivity at 90% ethane conversion, again attributed to an orthorhombic M1 phase.132 Selective olefin formation strongly depends on the formation of orthorhombic (SbO)2M20O56 or Te2M20O57 (M = V or Mo, with/without Nb) phases that form at 600 °C.101 The question arises whether Te, Sb or Nb play any role in the catalysis, or are simply structural promotors stabilising the M1 phase. Pure orthorhombic MoO3VOx catalysts (Fig. 6)133 reveal excellent low temperature performance with a high productivity of 11 × 10−3 molC2H4 gcat−1 h−1 at 335 °C, slightly exceeding that for MoVTeNbO of 10 × 10−3 molC2H4 gcat−1 h−1 at 380 °C.108

The trigonal phase and amorphous catalysts are less active, with tetragonal MoO3VOx showing the lowest activity. The superior activity of orthorhombic phases was attributed to the presence of pentagonal structural units and concomitant generation of heptagonal channels (facilitating ethane adsorption) with nearby distorted octahedra providing active lattice oxygen species.133 Hence the roles of Te, Sb, and Nb appear predominately as structural promotors rather than as active participants in ethane ODH. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that V-modified TeO sites could be responsible for C–H activation via a reduction-coupled oxo activation mechanism, predicting an optimum ensemble of Te2V5Ox.135
The surface morphology of the M1 phase of MoVTeNb oxides is crucial for maximising active sites, with the (001) facet believed to be the most active for ethane ODH. Although this facet is normally a minority in the M1 phase of Mo–V–X particles, it's presence can be increased by hydrothermal synthesis to grow rod-shaped crystals.102,136 Recent HAADF-STEM analysis demonstrated a correlation between C–H activation rates and stepped surfaces at the (001), (120), and (210) facets, indicating that more open atom arrangements are more active than those formed at densely packed surfaces (Fig. 7).137 Based on these findings, modified hydrothermal routes have been developed to direct crystallisation of the M1 phase; solution growth rates are controlled by organic complexing agents to promote termination of specific facets.99 Resulting materials exhibited superior performance due to the formation of highly corrugated side walls on M1 particles which exposed a large concentration of active sites.

In summary, Te and Sb assist in the genesis and stabilisation of crystalline phases selective for ODH.101,108,138 Low oxidation state catalysts lacking Nb are more efficient for ethane activation than those containing Nb. Lower oxidation states of Mo and V (lower than Mo6+ and V5+) are desirable to maximise ethane oxidation activity, necessitating high temperature heat treatments (∼600 °C).101,139 However, V5+ species also have an important influence on the activity of phase-pure M1 catalysts, with a linear correlation observed between catalyst activity and V5+ concentration;139,140 oxygen plasma treatment of the M1 phase of MoVNbTeOx promotes transformation of V4+ to V5+ and enhanced ethane ODH activity (Fig. 8).141 Attempts to further promote MoVTeNbO with Bi and K revealed that although Bi can increase the V5+:V4+ ratio142 and enhance ethane ODH activity (Fig. 9), K lowered activity. Incorporation of Bi in the six-membered channels of the M1 phase was suggested to be optimal for Bi:Mo ratios of 0.015–0.025,143 with Bi–O–Bi species proposed to increase catalyst stability by inhibiting Te surface segregation and loss during reaction (Fig. 10).143

Cerium doping of MoVNbTeO catalysts can also enhance ethane ODH through enriching lattice oxygen species and increasing the V5+ surface concentration.144 The resulting high ethene productivity of ∼1.11 kgC2H4 kgcat−1 h−1, maintained for 200 h on-stream, represents a significant step towards a viable process (Fig. 11).

Further catalytic enhancement of reducible oxides for ethane ODH has been sought using high surface area oxide supports. Surface characterisation of γ-Al2O3 supported V and Mo oxides reveals a dependence on ODH activity with support coverage, with active mixed Mo–V–O species only formed in multilayers.145 In contrast, mesoporous Al2O3 supported V–Mo–O oxides100 exhibit enhanced ethene selectivity compared to γ-Al2O3, attributed to (i) the existence of isolated VO4 units, and (ii) blocking of unselective support sites by MoOx species.100 However, attempts to immobilise the M1 phase of mixed oxides on TiO2, γ-Al2O3, ZrO2 or Nb2O5 have largely been unsuccessful; the support inhibits crystallisation of the active M1 phase.110,138
Hence, although supporting MoVTe(Sb)NbO mixed oxides improves resulting mechanical properties, it is detrimental to catalytic performance.109,110,138 Less reactive supports such as SiO2 or α-Al2O3 may therefore be desirable to minimise perturbation of the local chemical environment of adsorbed Mo or V species during catalyst synthesis.138 Indeed, the introduction of colloidal silica to the slurry formed during MoVTe(Sb)NbO synthesis109 exerted minimal influence on the genesis of M1 phases and associated ethene selectivity, while improving ethane conversion.
The ethane ODH performance of ceria supported M1 phases of MoVTe(Sb)NbO141 depends on the abundance of V5+ species. Sol–gel methods generate small CeO2 crystallites (Fig. 12) with high V5+ surface concentrations through a redox solid-state reaction in which Ce(IV)O2 reduces to Ce(III)2Mo(IV)O6 during 400 °C calcination. M1/CeO2 catalysts containing 0 to 70 wt% CeO2 show optimum ODH at 30 wt% CeO2,146 with higher CeO2 contents promoting combustion.146 As-prepared materials contained mixtures of M1 and M2 phases, however 573 °C treatment in nitrogen increased the proportion of M1 phase.109 Although the M2 orthorhombic phase of (TeO)2M6O18 (M = Mo or V, with/without Nb) is desirable for propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile (the reaction these catalysts were originally developed for),76,110 this phase favours carboxylic acid formation rather than ethene during ethane ODH.118

Silica was claimed to prevent sintering and agglomeration of the M1 phase, with thermal treatment decreasing the proportion of smaller pores where total oxidation is favoured.109 β-SiC foams are reported as effective supports for MoVTeNbO catalysts,110 due to their high porosity, thermal resistance, and tortuosity compared to honeycomb monolithic ceramics. Coated foams are less active than powdered catalysts for ethane ODH as less M1 phase is present in the supported catalysts. SEM and XRD suggest that a single layer coating contained little active phase whereas a two layer coating comprised considerable mixed oxide, however selective phases such as TeMo5O15 and Mo0.97V0.95O5 were not formed.110 More work is required to explore the controlled growth of supported MoVSb(Te)NbO mixed oxides, possibly exploiting atomic layer deposition148 to tune support coverage and passivate unselective facets.149


2.1.3 Phosphorous containing vanadium oxides. 
Vanadium phosphorus oxides have been extensively studied over the past two decades due to their potential application in alkane ODH.150 The crystal structure of vanadium phosphate is shown in Fig. 13.
 Fig. 13  Structural illustration of vanadium phosphate. Reproduced from ref. 151 Copyright (2011) with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. 
The catalytic behaviour of vanadyl phosphate largely depends on the type (V5+ phosphate or V5+ and V4+ oxides) and dispersion of vanadium species, which in supported species are regulated by the vanadium coverage and support acid–base properties.152–154 A monolayer dispersion of VOPO4 over a suitable support enhances vanadium reducibility and concomitant ethane ODH performance;155,156 mixed VPMo-oxide catalysts achieve 14% ethane conversion and 67% ethene selectivity.123 (PMo11VO40)4− units are commonly assumed to form during catalyst preparation, whose dissociation during calcination improves the dispersion of phosphate groups. Enhanced interactions between V and Mo species reflect stabilisation of MoVI in solid solutions of V in MoO3 and Mo5O14. The resulting synergy in Mo11VPOx confers superior activity to MoOx and Mo11VOx phases.123 The catalytic activity of MoVP oxides increased in the order of Mo < MoV < MoVP, mirroring the trend in ethene selectivity at the expense of combustion, attributed to P promoting isolated patches of selective Mo and V oxo species.119,123
The influence of VOPO4/TiO2 preparation method on ethane ODH at 823 K152 revealed similar activities for V2O5/TiO2157,158 and VOP/TiO2152,159 of around 3 × 10−2 mol(C2H6) mol−1(V) s−1), with ethane activation postulated as more dependent on the active site dispersion than the nature of vanadium species. However, ethene selectivity over V2O5/TiO2 was less than that over 7.0 VOP/TiO2 ss when prepared by single step (ss = direct impregnation by VOP) synthesis, whereas selectivity over 9.6 VOP/TiO2 ds prepared by dual step (ds = impregnation with NH4H2PO4 and then NH4VO3) synthesis was less than both 9.6 VOP/TiO2 ss and 7.0 VOP/TiO2 ss, suggesting that the surface species influence ethene formation. Although catalysts prepared by ss and ds methods both contained V(IV) and V(V) oxides alongside VOPO4, the greater V(IV) dispersion achieved by direct synthesis is likely responsible for enhancing ethane ODH.152 Accordingly, two possible explanations are provided: (i) direct impregnation favours small domains, where according to site isolation theory phosphate dilutes vanadium species;160,161 or (ii) it limits oxygen availability, favouring V4+–V5+ or V4+ species which are more selective.152,153 The different concentrations of vanadium species for catalysts prepared by ss or ds methods are reported in Table 2. XPS analysis of titania supported catalysts suggest they enhance the fraction of V4+ surface species relative to Al2O3 and SiO2, accounting for the formers’ superior ethane conversion and ethene selectivity.152,156

Catalytic tests indicate that high temperatures (550 °C) stabilise V(IV) species which are selective towards C2H4 in supported VOPO4.154–156,159 In spite of the promoting effect of V4+ on ethene selectivity, V3+ (formed over VOP/Al2O3 and FeVOP/Al2O3 during ODH) promotes undesired combustion at long contact times.163 The activity of VOP/Al2O3 (conversion 15–20%) exceeds that of FeVOP/Al2O3 (conversion 5–10%) at 550 °C due to the presence of V4+.164 Lower oxidation state vanadium (V3+) is favoured at high reaction temperature (650 °C).163 Fe substitution of supported and unsupported VOP4·2H2O,165 modifies the redox and acid properties of the bulk materials due to partial substitution of Fe3+ for VO3+ groups in vanadyl orthophosphate. Such effects were less significant for TiO2 supported catalysts,165 whose redox and acid properties are mostly influenced by vanadium–titanium interactions (which increase activity by two orders of magnitude versus bulk analogues).152,155,165 M-Doped VPO (M = Zr, Bi) show enhanced ODH activity due to increased surface areas and basicity,166 and preferential exposure of (001) planes of VOPHPO4·0.5H2O which terminate in vanadyl oxygen atoms166 and alongside (100) planes appear key to VOP catalytic activity.74 Metal pyrophosphates are another category of V, P and O containing catalysts, which are active ODH catalysts for n-butane to isobutene conversion, while vanadium exchanged Ti, Zr and Sn-pyrophosphates are considered active catalysts for ethane ODH.112 In contrast to supported VPO catalysts, no vanadium phosphate species were detected in these materials, although V4+ oxides were detected. Improved catalytic activity of V/TiP compared to V/ZrP and V/SnP was attributed to isolated surface vanadium oxide species.112
Among the supported VOPx oxides, TiO2 supported vanadyl phosphates have the best performance in ethane ODH, attributed to their fabrication method.152,155,156 Al2O3 and SiO2 supported catalysts exhibit lower catalyst activity due to poor dispersion of the active phase;152 the surface acidity of SiO2 promotes VOPO4 aggregation152,155 and the formation of V2O5 crystallites. The affinity between VOx and metal oxide supports (and hence dispersion) depends on the support basicity, which decreases in the order V2O5 > SiO2 > TiO2 = ZrO2 > Al2O3 > MgO.72 Agglomeration of VOx species most likely occurs through polymerisation over acidic centres on the support surface, as demonstrated by XRD,152 with aggregates detected on TiO2 when the coverage exceeds one monolayer.155,156 The effects of support on catalyst activity and selectivity for ethane ODH are illustrated in Table 3.156 Among other oxide supports, SiO2 favours 3D agglomerates of active VOP phases even at low loadings.167 In summary, the reducibility and acidity of vanadium phosphate is increased by dispersion over TiO2, whose enhanced catalytic performance compared to VOPO4 is ascribed to modified redox properties.155,156,159,165 Note that vanadium dispersion mainly influences the availability of oxygen-insertion sites, which can catalyse undesired oxidation of the olefin product (Fig. 14).74,112

2.1.4 Other vanadium containing oxides. 
In addition to transition metals and phosphorous, incorporation of alkaline earth metals such as Mg can enhance the bulk selectivity of V2O5 in light alkane ODH.71,72 VMgO systems are active at 500–600 °C and show enhanced surface area and basicity compared to V2O5.13 Two kinds of V–Mg oxide catalysts, namely Meso-VMg and Mix-VMg oxides, were employed in ethane ODH.168,169 Higher conversions were observed over Meso-VMg materials with lower V:Mg ratios, whereas higher ethene selectivity required higher V:Mg ratios (values <1 are reported to yield unselective catalysts71); a balance was required to optimise both performance parameters. V:Mg ratio is not the sole factor determining catalytic activity, with structural properties also influential.168,169 The enhanced catalytic activity of Meso-VMg with respect to Mix-VMg in ethane ODH was attributed to V2O3 encapsulation of a highly dispersed MgO species and associated larger surface areas.168 The nature of active sites in VMgO catalysts remains unclear. Mix-VMgO contained high levels of a Mg3(VO4)2 phase present in very small domains, and is believed responsible for lowering activity.170 In contrast, magnesium pyrovanadate, Mg2V2O7, is implicated as an active phase in MgO supported V2O5.70,76 The high selectivity of Mg2V2O7 reflects its ability to stabilise V4+ cations which are associated with oxygen vacancies.70 Low V loadings in supported MgO systems favour the less active V5+versus V4+ species.72,168 Formation of V5+ species may therefore account for the lower activity of Mix-VMgO with respect to Meso-VMgO. Catalytic performance in ethane ODH is difficult to predict due to the complex interplay between the multiple possible co-existing magnesium vanadate phases and vanadium oxidation states.70
In contrast to other vanadium containing mixed oxides, the activity of Cr–V–O is less than pure chromia for ethane ODH. Cr–V–O oxides also require higher activation temperatures, attributed to their poorer reducibility (420 °C versus 219 °C for pure chromia).171


2.1.5 Nickel based oxides. 
Attempts to find new catalysts for low temperature ethene production led researchers to investigate whether Ni oxide catalysts used for oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) could be adapted for ODH, given similarities in these transformations.12,172,173 The redox properties of silica supported nickel ODH catalysts were first explored.173 NiO is a p-type semiconductor, with holes as majority charge carriers balancing Ni3+ and O− ions.174–176 Ni oxides can stabilise different catalytically relevant oxygen surface species.177–18018O2 isotope exchange experiments demonstrate that strongly bound lattice O2− species were responsible for ethane ODH and ethene over-oxidation, whereas non-stoichiometric O− species promote ethane combustion to CO2.181,182 In contrast, O2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) studies show O− binds more strongly to Ni sites than O2− species in Ni–Zr–O, and O− was hypothesised as the selective oxygen species favouring ethene production.183 However, most reports suggest that high O− coverages on NiO result in poor ethene selectivity, and hence that their surface coverage must be minimised to suppress total oxidation.174,175,182 NiO catalysts containing non-stoichiometric oxygen species, produced by 500 °C calcination, showed good ethane ODH performance with a 19.3% yield of ethene at 400 °C.176
Many studies have investigated the properties of unsupported183–188 and supported NiO189–191 catalysts to improve their ethane ODH performance. Dispersing NiO nanoparticles on alumina modifies its chemical and electronic properties, promoting ethane ODH by increasing the NiO dispersion and eliminating unselective sites.191–193 For mixed NiO oxides, dopants influence the amount and mobility of oxygen species in catalytic oxides.194 The catalytic activity of NiO doped with reducible metal oxides correlates with the rate of H-abstraction, which in turn depends on both catalyst reducibility and the rate of reoxidation of active sites via a Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism.50,175,181,195 It was reported that electrophilic oxygen species present in NiO could be decreased or increased depending on the valence state of the dopant (Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Ta and Nb), promoting or poisoning ethane ODH.
Temperature programmed 18O2 isotope exchange measurements have been employed to investigate the nature and performance of oxygen species responsible for selective and non-selective oxidation of ethane over mixed oxides.181,185,196 The interaction of catalyst and adsorbed oxygen includes electron transfer from solid to adsorbate, and the conversion of molecular oxygen to lattice O2− anions through dissociation, diffusion and lattice incorporation as illustrated below, where (s) refers to adsorbed species.181O2(g) ⇔ O2(s) ⇔ O2−(s) ⇔ O22−(s) ⇔ 2O−(s) ⇔ 2O2−(s) ⇔ 2O2−(latt)The distribution of isotopically-exchanged products depends on the relative rates of each step.181 The rate of O2 reduction to O2−, and its final insertion into anionic vacancies, are key steps that limit the lifetime of electrophilic and unselective oxygen species.150,167 The rate of formation of 16O18O species over NiO surfaces reveals that oxygen insertion and diffusion are rate-limiting, whereas surface oxygen dissociation is rapid.181,185 The incorporation of other elements such as Nb, W, Sn or Ce in the NiO lattice, through replacement of nickel atoms and/or filling of cationic vacancies in the non-stoichiometric NiO surface, reduces active sites for oxygen dissociation.50,54,194,196,197 The diffusion of unselective O− into the bulk, and a concomitant rise in less labile but selective O2− species, has been demonstrated by TPD-O2 and electrical conductivity measurements.174,181
Doping NiO with higher valence cations such as Nb, which act as electron donors, will decrease the number of holes and hence the amount of electrophilic O− in NiO.186,197,198 Nb addition can thus tune ethene selectivity186,199 by modifying the concentration and lability of surface oxygen species in NiO.175,181,188,194,200 In contrast, doping with low valent Li suppresses the ethene yield to only 8.4%.186 Group IV, V and VI dopants such as Zr, V, Ti, W and Mo201 lower NiO ethane ODH activity, but enhance selectivity (being greatest for Ni–W–O and Ni–Ti–O). Other studies demonstrate the influence of Ta:Ni ratio on NiO structure and resulting catalyst activity.202 Ta doping of NiO improves both activity and selectivity by eliminating electrophilic oxygen species, thereby preventing over-oxidation to CO2. However, sol–gel catalysts exhibit poorer selectivity due to a high concentration of Ta5+ at the NiO surface, which hinders desorption of reactively-formed ethene. Solid state grinding offers a solventless and hence more sustainable route to metal promoted NiO catalysts.200 Ti, W and Sn can be incorporated into NiO by solid state synthesis, affording 4 nm particles with surface areas ∼250 m2 g−1. The reducibility of such mixed oxides decreases due to strong metal–NiO interactions which lower the amount of non-stoichiometric oxygen, and hence increase ethene selectivity (Fig. 15).203

Comparison of Nb, Sn and La doped NiO for ethane ODH204 revealed that La–NiO exhibited the lowest selectivity (52.4%) whereas Nb–NiO and Sn–NiO showed a high selectivity of ∼83% due to slower Ni2+ reduction. In the absence of oxidant Sn–NiO outperformed Nb–NiO as SnO2 aggregates hindered Ni2+ reduction and coke formation.204
The electrical conductivity of M-doped NiO catalysts (M = Li, Mg, Al, Ga, Ti, Nb)195 also influences their catalytic behaviour, with an inverse correlation reported between ODH selectivity and p-type conductivity (Fig. 16).205 Al doping of NiO decreased the amount of electrophilic oxygen thereby increasing ethene selectivity.206 Overall, Nb addition was optimal for ethane ODH since it does not alter the reaction mechanism over NiO yet allows for mild perturbation of the electronic and structural properties of the active sites responsible for selective ethene formation.182,192,194 Optimum ODH activity was obtained for a Nb:Ni ratio of 0.176 (Ni0.85Nb0.15), which afforded the highest ethene selectivity.174,175,181,197 The surface acidity of Nb–Ni–O oxides also varies with Nb:Ni ratio, being highest for Ni0.85Nb0.15. Poorer catalytic performance at greater Nb contents was attributed to phase separation of NiO and Nb2O5, with the associated loss of Ni–O–Nb linkages174 resulting in significant catalyst deactivation.175,194 Isotope exchange measurements indicated that the amount and reducibility of exchangeable oxygen decreased dramatically for Ni0.85Nb0.15, attributed to Nb suppressing the formation of electrophilic oxygen species.175,181

Addition of other elements, including Ce, Sn, W, Zr, Mg and Al, also decreased the reducibility of NiO catalysts due to electronic stabilisation.50,183,185,196,207,208 A drop in surface acidity following Mg addition enhanced ethene desorption from meso-NiMgO, likely accounting for the resulting improved catalytic performance of meso-NiMgO versus meso-NiO.207 The impact of dopants on structural properties also strongly affects performance.186 The formation of NiO on Ni–Al–O mixed oxides, derived from calcined Ni–Al hydrotalcites, correlated with ODH activity; activity loss following high temperature calcination (500–900 °C) was attributed to Ni dissolution into Al2O3 and associated loss of NiO.208 A complex interaction between Ni–Al mixed oxides, NiO, NiAl2O4 spinel, and alumina exists in this multicomponent catalyst, with active sites most likely residing at the NiO-mixed oxide interface which dictates ODH activity.
For Ni–Nb–O mixed oxides, formation of a Ni–Nb solid solution was identified as responsible for improved ethene selectivity;197 a “mutual protective effect” between NiO and Nb2O5 was proposed to prevent the crystallisation and/or growth of NiO particles.175 A similar effect was observed on ZrO2 addition which hindered NiO particle growth.183 NiO–MgO solid solutions, formed by 600 °C calcination, are also postulated as active phases for the ethane ODH.189 Bulk and supported NiO–WO3 catalysts also exhibit unique selectivity towards ethene in ethane ODH.193 W-rich materials offer low ethene selectivity, attributed to the coexistence of WO3 and NiWO4, with W:(Ni + W) ratios between 0.25 to 0.3 optimal for ethene production.185 For ethane ODH at 450 °C, the optimum ratio was 0.26, but was dependent on the catalyst synthesis method, which influenced the physicochemical properties.209 The effect of various promoters (Al, Sn, K, Ce, Zr, Ce + Zr, La, Nb) on ethene selectivity over NiO was explored by XPS and FTIR.198 While the best promoters were high valence metals, for a common valence, more acidic promoters enhanced ethene selectivity. The influence of particle size, surface area and Lewis acidity were also addressed,50,196 with NiO–CeO2 and NiO–SnO2 mixed oxide catalysts exhibiting smaller NiO crystallites and therefore higher surface areas than bulk NiO. It was suggested that high M loadings in M–NiO nanocomposites (M = W, Sn) confer strong Lewis acidity, facilitating ethene decomposition and hence low ethene selectivity.185,196 Excess CeO2 in Ce–Ni–O mixed oxides appears responsible for the decomposition and slow desorption of ethene due to the increased Lewis acid loading associated with CeO2 alongside Ce1−xNixO2;50 an optimal Ni:Ce ratio of 50 was reported (Fig. 17). Small amounts (0.5 wt%) of Ce are also reported to improve ethene productivity,210 being sufficient to promote rapid oxygen transfer from ceria to NiO oxygen vacancies, thereby closing the redox cycle and increasing activity. The negative influence of Ce on NiO reducibility can be inhibited via Zr incorporation (Fig. 18), with Ni0.85Ce0.075Zr0.075 showing high ethene productivity of 6.94 μmol ethene gcat−1 s−1.211

Particle size is another important parameter in ODH catalyst performance, since at similar ethane conversions meso-NiO demonstrated higher ethene selectivity than nano-NiO.207 NiO dispersion on the support is influenced by the support pore volume, with Al2O3 exhibiting the highest pore volume and NiO dispersion.191 Supporting NiO nanoparticles is essential for high selectivity to ethene at low temperatures (<450 °C) since the intrinsic affinity of NiO for ethene activation is low. 15 wt% Ni–Co oxides supported on AISi-314 foams also show improved ethene productivity versus supported pure NiO.212 There are however exceptions, with supported Nb-promoted NiO inferior to its bulk counterpart, possibly reflecting the complex Nb–NiO interactions in the mixed oxide as outlined earlier.192
For alumina supported NiO, metal promoters incorporated between the nickel and alumina phases weakened the NiO–support interactions, hampering Ni incorporation into the alumina lattice and consequently exposing more NiO active sites.192 Ti-Containing supports also improved the NiO dispersion and corresponding ODH selectivity compared to Si-containing ones, by slowing NiO reduction kinetics during ethane ODH.213 The use of high surface area TiO2 supports (55 and 85 m2 g−1) further improved NiO dispersion, improving ethene yields (Fig. 19).214 Approximately 5–10 monolayers of NiO (where each layer was approximately 12 g/100 m2) was reported as optimal for ethane ODH,214 with higher coverages leading to unmodified NiO crystallites which favour CO2 formation. Depositing NiO on mixed oxide supports such as titanium silicates with a Ti/(Ti + Si) ratio of 0.25 enhanced catalytic ODH efficiency relative to pure oxide supports due to a more homogeneous NiO distribution (Fig. 20).215

For MgO supports, the optimum NiO loading was 5 wt%; greater loadings promoted NiO particle growth.189 Addition of POx to NiO/ZrO2 catalysts helped to maintain Ni in an oxidised state during ethane ODH, with the optimum POx loading being 0.52 w%.190 POx/NiO/ZrO2 was reported190 active for 12 h at 450 °C, whereas NiO/MgO189 required 600 °C. For Co–Ni systems, the optimum Co:Ni atomic ratio was 0.114, with higher ratios inducing Co3O4 and CoxOy–Al2O3 phase segregation and particle growth, suppressing ethene productivity.212
The use of etched Ni-foam modified with Al2O3 and CeO2, yielded highly stable and active CeO2–NiO–Al2O3 catalysts with an ethene productivity of 425 gC2H4 kg−1 h−1.216 Doping of such a NiO–Al2O3/Ni-foam (NANF) with ZrO2 and CeO2 (Fig. 21) improved the H-abstraction ability of NiO, further increasing ethene productivity to 510 gC2H4 kg−1 h−1.216,217

Analogous Nb2O5–NiO/Ni-foams also show promise in reducing the concentration of unselective oxygen species. The calcination protocol was important in controlling catalyst performance, with repeated calcinations (Nb2O5–NiO/Ni-foam-A) lowering activity (Fig. 22).218 Precursor concentration of the impregnating solution also influenced the final NiO distribution of treated foams; coatings prepared with dilute solutions offer higher dispersion than those using concentrated solutions.212

A mathematical model, based on the proposed ODH mechanism over Ni–Nb–O catalysts, was developed to help optimise O2 addition to multi-tubular and membrane reactors.219 It was concluded that a two-bed reactor with intermediate injection of oxygen offered superior heat and mass transfer and hence a greater ethene yield than a single bed reactor. The membrane reactor improved the axial distribution of O2, while maintaining a low O2 partial pressure to favour ethene production. Superior heat management was possible through O2 permeation across the membrane reactor compared to a conventional multi-tubular reactor (Fig. 23).30,220 A 1D steady state model of a tubular catalytic reactor was also developed to simulate staged O2 admission.221 An atmospheric pressure feed with an ethane:O2 ratio of 2 at temperatures between 300–350 °C led to the highest ethene productivity, however, addition of oxygen in four stages led to a 17% reduction in cooling demand (Fig. 24).

2.1.6 Cobalt containing mixed oxides. 
The activity of cobalt catalysts, frequently used in oxidation reactions, cannot be correlated with a redox mechanism because the oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+ is facile under normal reaction conditions.222 The existence of Co3+ is suggested by UV-visible-NIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies of cobalt-apatite materials prepared by impregnation.223 The influence of cobalt loading, and the nature and size of cobalt species in cobalt oxide apatite materials prepared by impregnation and ion-exchange methods have been explored.223,224 The maximum alkene yield in ODH was greater for ion-exchange catalysts (21.3%) containing only Co2+ species224 than for impregnated catalysts (16.6%) containing both Co2+ and Co3+.223 However, trends in catalyst performance were ascribed to their acid–base properties rather than the Co3+:Co2+ couple;223,224 the basicity of oxygen species appears to dominate alkane C–H activation.222–226 Calcium is proposed to modulate the basicity and hence activity of bridging oxygen species in cobalt apatite,223,224 and likewise for magnesium in Mg3−xCox(PO4)2.226 Phosphorous also enhances the catalytic performance of cobalt apatites,223,224 and magnesium–cobalt oxides,226 however, its addition to cobalt–titania suppresses ODH activity.225 Co2+ in octahedral sites is believed to be necessary for effective ODH catalysis,222–228 with 1 wt% Co on apatite delivering a maximum ethene yield of 21% at 550 °C. Higher cobalt loadings (>1.7 wt%) induce a transition from active isolated Co2+–O–Ca2+ entities to less active Co2+–O–Co2+ ensembles in Co3O4 nanocrystals.223,224 However, for titania supported catalysts the existence of both Co2+ and Co3O4 spinel (at cobalt concentrations >3.7 wt%) were beneficial, with the highest ethene yield (13.3% at 550 °C) obtained for 7.6 wt% Co/TiO2.225


2.1.7 Other mixed oxides. 
The role of other elements such as Mo, Cr and Mg as single component or mixed oxides in ethane ODH has also attracted attention. MoO3 nanoclusters dispersed on TiO2 nanorods229 show excellent activity and lifetime, with 55.2% ethane conversion and 92.1% ethene selectivity for 80 h operation (Fig. 25). Mixed metal oxides of Cr/Co/Sn/W and Cr/Mo oxides have also been explored for ethane ODH, offering ethene selectivity of 55–65% and a maximum yield of 20%.230

MoO3 coated Fe2O3 nanoparticles exhibit decreased catalyst reducibility and coking, and increased ethene yield, attributed to lattice oxygen from MoO3 and Fe2(MoO4)3 in the surface layers. Optimum performance during ethane TPR (Fig. 26) was observed for 3 and 6 monolayers (ML) of MoO3 encapsulating α-Fe2O3 particles.231

2.2 Non-reducible mixed oxides
Most catalysts in this group are based on rare-earth metal oxides (REO), although some members include Li–Mg oxides.58,232 Their main mode of operation is through gas phase ethyl radical formation,13,58 possibly reflecting the high operating temperatures >600 °C at which homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions occur.233 Indeed reaction mixture ignition over REOs provides the heat required for subsequent gas phase reactions.233
Halide doping facilitates high ethene yields at temperatures <600 °C.58,74 Since chlorine containing catalysts show very low activity for ethene conversion during OCM, a high selectivity towards ethene during ethane ODH would be expected,37 and is an attractive strategy to improve ethene selectivity and yield.37,58 However, halide use increases corrosion and ethene contamination, which is undesirable for subsequent applications such as polyethene synthesis.58 Halide-doped perovskites and alkali/alkaline earth metal oxides are two classes of catalyst explored for ethane ODH.

2.2.1 Rare earth oxide-based catalysts. 
Rare earth oxides (REO) are p-type semiconductors, and particularly effective catalysts when doped with alkali/alkaline earth metals.13,74 Partial ion-exchange of alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides or halides into oxyhalides or rare earth oxides results in lattice deformations which create morphologies suitable for activation of molecular oxygen.234,235 In addition, enhanced mobility of lattice oxygen is reported when rare earth metals are doped with platinum or palladium.236 REO derived catalysts can activate ethane at temperatures above 500 °C, close to the autoignition temperature.74 Alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) promoted La2O3 catalysts237 show ethane ODH activity >700 °C, with Ba- and Sr-promoted La2O3 the most promising. Ethane conversion >50% was observed with >80% selectivity at extremely short contact times (<10 ms).237 Surface area, mechanical durability and thermal/hydrothermal stability of catalysts was improved using Ba-promoted La2O3 supported on an aluminosilicate, which increased C2 + olefin selectivity to ≥85%.238 Similar results were obtained for SrO-promoted Er2O3 on an aluminosilicate support.239 Supporting La2O3 and Sm2O3 on MgO was also reported to stabilise the surface area and increase the overall specific activity. Although bulk Sm2O3 was more active than bulk La2O3, their supported counterparts show different behaviour.240 The role of SrxLa1.0Nd1.0Oy catalysts as igniters in autothermal ethane ODH241,242 shows that increasing pre-heating temperature, oxygen partial pressure and space velocity raise reactor temperatures, favouring thermal dehydrogenation of ethane or ethyl radicals.241,242 Higher selectivity towards COx was reported using SrLaNdO241,242 and SrO-promoted Er2O3239 catalysts at >700 °C, which is an indication of homogeneous reactions, resulting in ethene yields comparable to thermal cracking242 (although similar ethene yields were achieved at lower temperature).241 Ethene selectivity depends strongly on the C2H6:O2 ratio when REO catalysts act as radical activators under fuel-rich (limited O2) conditions that promote homogeneous reactions.238–243 In contrast, selectivity was only weakly dependent on ethane:oxygen ratio for Na promoted La2O3, with a maximum selectivity (79%) exceeding that for MgO supported La2O3 (53%). This difference was attributed to the participation of lattice oxygen (heterogeneous mechanism) in the former versus adsorbed oxygen species in the latter (homogeneous mechanism).240 Autothermal operation was promising for ethene production from ethane, with yields up to 46% over REO catalysts such as LaSr0.02Ox, SmSr0.2Ox and SmNa0.028P0.014Ox.233 High ethene productivity and long catalyst lifetime were possible due to favourable conditions during autothermal ethane ODH, employing a small reactor volume with millisecond contact time and REO catalysts as igniters.241,242 Steam addition further increased ethene yield at the expense of CO.241 Temperature enhanced ethene selectivity over MgO supported La2O3 or Sm2O3, and Na-promoted lanthana, attributed to the ease of ethyl radical release at higher temperature.240 The same effect was reported for LaMnO3 monolithic catalysts wherein 55% ethene yield was obtained.243
The use of chlorine containing promotors revealed that Cl− eliminated active sites responsible for deep oxidation of ethane and ethene, favouring sites for ethane selective oxidation.234,235,244 SrCl2 and BaCl2 are most promising halide dopants for REOs in the 3+ oxidation state, with SrCl2 the most effective promotor for REOs in other oxidation states.234 Thus, a significant improvement in ethene selectivity was observed for SrCl2-promoted Pr, Ce, Tb, Sm and Nd oxides,234,235 and BaCl2 modified Er2O3.244 In SrCl2-doped REOs (Pr, Ce or Tb), catalysts which exhibit two principal oxidation states exhibit limited replacement of Cl− ions for RE4+, increasing the concentration of RE3+ species able to donate electrons to gaseous oxygen and form O−, O22− or O2− species.234 O2-TPD and TPR revealed that incorporation of SrCl2 and BaCl2 in the REO lattice increases activation of gas-phase dioxygen. This phenomenon depends on lattice defects (e.g. trapped electrons and anion vacancies) arising from ion-exchange between SrCl2 or BaCl2, and the choice of REO phase and particle size. Doping REO lattices with SrCl2 or BaCl2 is key to improving catalyst performance,235,244 with SrCl2/Sm2O3 reportedly superior to SrCl2/Nd2O3 owing to the greater lattice expansion of Sm2O3 in a 40 mol% SrCl2/Sm2O3 material.235 The impact of BaCl2 on lattice expansion and defect formation in cubic Er2O3 was enhanced when nanoscale Er2O3 was employed rather than larger crystallites.244 O2 molecules can accept electrons at defect sites to create O2−, O22−, O2− or O− surface species, whose reactivity with hydrocarbons decreases in the order of O− ≥ O22− > O2− > O2−.234,235,244 Doping REOs with SrCl2 or BaCl2 promotes O2− formation, considered the most active species for selective oxidation of ethane, and suppresses O− species responsible for the deep oxidation of ethane.234,235,244 SrCl2 promoted catalysts are stable over 60 h on-stream at 660 °C,234,235 with the addition of chlorine-containing compounds to the feed further improving ethene yield, albeit at the expense of catalyst activity.77


2.2.2 Halide doped perovskites. 
Perovskites have the formula ABO3 in which A and B cations possess AO12 and BO6 coordinations respectively.245,246 Perovskite type oxides are thermally stable and expose redox active surfaces suitable for oxidative reactions. In such oxides, replacement of A and/or B site cations with other metal cations can tune the resulting catalytic properties (Fig. 27)245,247,248e.g. by introducing oxygen vacancies.

Addition of F− or Cl− ions to oxygen vacancies decreases the concentration of oxygen vacancies, while increasing their redox ability, enabling catalysts to be switched from combustion to selective ethane oxidation to ethene.235,247,250 Metal halide doping is thus an effective method to promote perovskite catalysts, with activity enhancement attributed to suppressed CO2 poisoning of surface active sites and regulation of surface coverage of adsorbed oxygen species.251 Halide doped perovskites are inherently inactive for ethene oxidation, accounting for the high ethene selectivity of these catalysts.
The roles of F− and Cl− on the activity of La1−xSrxFeO3−δXσ,247 YBa2Cu3O7−δXσ,247 La1.6Sr0.4CuO4−δXσ,250 Sr0.63Ca0.27CuO2−δXσ,252 La1.85Sr0.15CuO4−δXσ and Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4−δXσ,253 La0.8Ba0.2Mn1−xCuxO3−δXσ,254 Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8−δXσ255 and La0.2Sr0.8TiO3±δXσ256 catalysts were investigated for ethane ODH. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), XPS, O2-TPD and 18O-pulsing studies demonstrated that F− and Cl− insertion in the catalyst lattice increases the activity of oxygen atoms towards selective oxidation reactions. Halide ions are proposed to interact with the lattice by: (1) filling oxygen vacancies; and (2) substituting for O2− in the lattice. Maintaining charge neutrality requires an increase in the oxidation states of neighboring cations in the former case, but a decrease in the latter. Addition of halide ions to Cu and Fe containing perovskite increased the Cu3+ and Fe4+ concentration relative to Cu2+ and Fe3+, indicating that oxygen vacancies are occupied by F− and Cl−. Electronegative halide ions enhance ethene selectivity by decreasing the valence electron density of O2−, and weakening the cation–oxygen bond, which in turn increases the lattice oxygen concentration.235,247,250,252–255


2.2.3 Alkali and alkaline-earth containing oxides. 
Alkali metal doped alkaline earth oxides are another class of non-reducible oxides employed in alkane ODH reactions.74,257,258 The efficiency of chlorinated Li/Dy2O3/MgO mixed oxides in ethane ODH is reported to be dependent on preparation method and calcination conditions.259,260 LiCO3 (inactive for ethane ODH) formation occurred when catalysts were calcined in air,259 or if weakly acidic supports were employed. However, increased acid strength arising from chlorine dopants promoted formation of a LiCl melt by destabilisation of LiCO3.260 Calcining in synthetic air (free from CO2) led to LiCl formation,259 with OCl− ions proposed as the active site for ethane ODH.259,261,262 Despite the high activity of OCl−, ternary samples (NaCl–KCl–MgCl2) were not active in ethane ODH. Moreover, when OCl− ions are surrounded by Cl− species in the melt, they acted as isolated sites which, according to the “site isolation” theory, are considered active sites in ethane selective oxidation.259 Insertion of alkali or alkaline earth metal chlorides into molten LiCl supported on Dy2O3/MgO also increased ethene selectivity by lowering the melting point of LiCl.262 The chloride content of the mixed oxide was also identified as an effective factor influencing catalytic performance.259,260 The highest ethene yield (77% at 610 °C) was achieved with catalysts containing the highest chloride loading (12 wt%), while a maximum selectivity (85% at 650 °C) to ethene was observed on catalysts with moderate acidity (6 wt% chloride loading).259,260 However, moderate to weak basicity, attributed to the incorporation of low electronegativity cations such as Na+, K+, Sr2+ and Ba2+ to LiCl/Dy2O3/MgO, was concluded as responsible for the higher ethene selectivity in these mixed oxide catalysts. The mobility of these cations weakened the ethene double bond interaction with the catalyst surface, inhibiting its readsorption and possible over-oxidation.262 Long-term stability of catalysts with high chloride content was observed in ethane ODH,259 albeit with shorter lifetimes than chloride-free catalysts which exhibit superior on-stream stability.77 The performance of chloride doped catalysts can be maintained provided HCl is not formed during reaction; halogen loss being the primary cause of deactivation.80
Total oxidation catalysts, including some perovskites, exhibit high oxygen mobility, in contrast to non-reducible metal oxides which require high activation temperatures.37 For oxides containing non-reducible metals, cation mobility in the melt262 was speculated as responsible for their enhanced catalytic performance. The ODH mechanism over non-reducible metal oxides was originally thought to initiate on the catalyst surface before continuing in the gas phase.74 However, a purely heterogeneous reaction mechanism was suggested for ethane ODH over LiCl/Dy2O3/MgO catalysts, in which unselective sites dissolved in the LiCl phase enhance ethene selectivity.261 Alkali metals were reported to create surface defects able to activate molecular oxygen.74 Resulting OCl− species, formed by oxidation of LiCl by dissolved atomic oxygen species, decomposed at high temperature to produce active radicals.259,261,262 These radicals activate ethane by homolytic H-abstraction, forming ethane radicals which further react with OH to form ethene.259
The basicity of Li–M–MD (M = K, Sr, Ba, Na, MD = Dy2O3/MgO) catalysts also improves ethene selectivity, possibly by aiding rapid desorption of electron-rich ethene thereby avoiding further oxidation to COx.262 This effect was also reported for propane ODH, wherein the introduction of MgO to Al2O3, or use of VOx/MgAl2O4, improved propene selectivity.80 High surface area, mesostructured nanocrystallite MgAl2O4-HT spinels (prepared from hydrotalcites) offer a high density of well-distributed active centres (compared to coprecipitated MgAl2O4-CP) improving molecular mass transport. Moreover, CoOx/MgAl2O4-HT was more reducible than CoOx/MgAl2O4-CP, attributed to stronger interactions of cobalt species with MgAl2O4-HT and consequent better catalytic performance.263,264 Calcined hydrotalcite Mg(Al)O also exhibits mild basic characteristics along with high thermal resistance to steam, and was used as support to minimise ethene adsorption and coking.265 Mg(Al)O supported Pt, Sn and Ga show ethene productivity of ∼1 kgC2H4 kgcat−1 h−1 for ethane ODH,265–269 approaching that viable for commercial applications.80

2.3 Noble metal containing catalysts
Ethane ODH has been performed by noble metal catalysts at high temperatures >800 °C and short contact times; short reactant/product contact times (∼1 × 10−4 s) improve selectivity by minimising product re-adsorption, and enable autothermal operation.
Kinetic analysis of ethane ODH over Pt/γ-Al2O3 in a non-adiabatic annular reactor provided quantitative insight on the role of gas reactions.270 The roles of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions in ethane ODH have also been investigated by computation.271 Combined experiments and kinetic modelling suggest that high-temperature ethene production is driven by gas-phase radical reactions at short contact times, with the catalyst active the non-selective oxidation of ethane to COx.272 Pt/Al2O3 catalysed partial oxidation of ethane has been studied under steady state (between 100–700 °C) and transient conditions (between 350–550 °C).273 No ethene was formed during transient experiments, in contrast to continuous flow experiments, in accordance with a gas-phase mechanism for ethene formation rather than a surface reaction. Short contact time ODH reactions over Pt monolithic catalysts,274 indicate that although alkenes form through gas-phase reactions, surfaces are important for the activation of carbon oxides and hydrogen. Hence process optimisation requires consideration of reactor morphology, fluid dynamics and the void fraction in addition to catalyst composition.275
LaMnO3 honeycomb monolith as supports for Pt catalysts were explored in an autothermal reactor. LaMnO3 catalysts are very effective catalyst for ethane ODH, providing greater ethene selectivity and yield relative to conventional Pt catalysts.276 However, Pt/LaMnO3 with a multi-layered framework involving a thin layer Pt coating over a LaMnO3 perovskite layer277 grown on a monolithic scaffold, demonstrate high temperature stability and ethene yields. Foam supports outperformed honeycomb monoliths, attributed to their higher surface area, tortuosity, and randomness of pores, which collectively increased heat and mass transfer rates. Optimisation of the Pt/LaMnO3 catalyst and process parameters achieved ethene selectivity and ethane conversion both >80%.278 Doping of Pt/LaMnO3 with Sn or Ga further increased alkene formation by promoting catalytic partial oxidation (CPO). Ethene + ethyne yields surpassed 68%, with a selectivity >80% achieved under self-sustained ethane CPO at short contact times.279 Ethane ODH was also explored over Pt–Sn impregnated monoliths (at 1 bar and 600–900 °C),280 revealing that Pt promoted ethane conversion while Sn promoted ethene selectivity, resulting in an ethene yield of 66% at 900 °C. Pt–Sn/LaMnO3 was more efficient than LaMnO3 on H2 addition to the feed,28 with ethene selectivity rising from 44% to 91% as the H2:C2H6 ratio was increased from 0 to 0.5. Short contact time ethane ODH over silica foams, and zirconia and alumina supported Pt catalysts,3 revealed lowest selectivity for the acidic zirconia support which favoured ethene decomposition to carbon.281
Silica modification of Pt/Al2O3 also increased ethene selectivity, despite a concomitant rise in Brønsted acidity;64 silica overlayers may suppress Pt aggregation and thereby improve catalyst stability at temperatures >600 °C (Fig. 28). Pd nanoparticle encapsulation by 8 nm Al2O3 films deposited by atomic laser deposition (ALD) also appears to inhibit metal sintering and filamentous carbon deposits, leading to a considerable improvement in ethane ODH performance at 675 °C (Fig. 29).282

3. Molecular sieve supported catalysts
3.1 Zeolites
Zeolites are microporous crystalline structures constructed from AlO4 and SiO4 tetrahedral building units into 0.5–1.2 nm diameter pore networks. Adjacent tetrahedra are linked by corner sharing oxygen atoms to form a three dimensional framework.283 The negative charge of the overall framework is compensated by a proton or exchangeable cation.284–287 Charge compensation by a proton forms bridging hydroxyl groups with Brønsted acidic character which are active in cracking and hydrocracking288 (Fig. 30).289 Tuning the Si:Al ratio controls the total acid site density, the balance of Brønsted:Lewis acidity, and the corresponding catalytic performance.290,291

Exchanging Brønsted acidic protons with metal cations creates Lewis acid sites active for C–H bond functionalisation. Elements with multiple stable oxidation states such as Cu, Co, Fe, Mo or V enhance the redox property of zeolites.292,293 The effect of heat treatment on the type and distribution of acid sites in Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts294 was explored using N2O decomposition as a probe for Fe species and oxidant in ethane ODH. Coordinatively unsaturated Fe3+ ions were observed for samples calcined at 550 °C, with Fe2+ observed as Fe–O–Al species at 900 °C. Extra-framework iron cations were proposed to interact with Al cations at high temperatures to form stable ferrous (Fe–O–Al) sites in zeolite channels.295 This change in iron speciation alters catalyst acidity by favouring weak and medium (protonic) acid sites which are also active for ethane ODH.
The role of metal ion coordination in Cr/ZSM-5 catalysed ethane ODH revealed that Cr6+ and possibly Cr5+ species are the most active sites for zeolites with Si:Al ratios >190, whereas Cr3+ was favoured over Al-rich zeolites which were active for oxidation rather than ODH.296,297 The activities of different zeolites with similar Si:Al ratios followed the order Cr/H-mordenite (20) > Cr/H-ZSM-5 (29) > Cr/H-beta (25).
The impact of pore structure on the activity of Fe zeolites298 concluded that ZSM-5 was active for ethane ODH, with mordenite and zeolite Y promoting total oxidation. A similar conclusion was reached for Co doped zeolites Co/BEA and Co/ZSM-5, which were superior for ethane ODH to Co/MOR and Co/FER,299 possibly reflecting differences in the micropore diameter and location of Co ions. The type of metal promoter is critical, with Ni doped zeolite KY more active for ethane ODH than Fe, Co and Cu analogues.300 An ethane conversion and ethene selectivity of 20% and 80% respectively was achieved for Ni/KY zeolite.
3.2 AlPOs and SAPOs
V, Co and/or Mg doped aluminophosphates with AFI type frameworks have been explored for ethane ODH and follow the trend CoVAPO-5 > VOx/Al2O3 > VAPO-5 > CoAPO-5 > MgVAPO-5.301 The low activity of MgVAPO-5 is attributed to its low crystallinity and micropore volume. Vanadium containing, and vanadium free catalysts show different activities owing to various oxidation states of cobalt ions. Detailed characterisation of Mg doped V-AlPO4-5 samples,302 shows that magnesium increases the concentration of reduced vanadium ions, conferring higher ethene selectivity. VCoAPO-18 materials show considerable efficiency for ethane ODH,303 with the existence of both acid (associated with Co2+) and redox (associated with V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) sites identified as key to enhancing ethene selectivity.304 Accordingly, VCoAPO-18 catalysts are efficient in ethane ODH with an ethene selectivity exceeding VAPO-18 and CoAPO-18.
Zeolite micropores play a crucial role in increasing selectivity to light alkenes, owing to pore confinement of reactants and intermediates. The structure, acidity, and activity of SAPO-34 depends on the amount and dispersion of Si in the structure which is sensitive to the preparation method.305 Formation of Brønsted acid sites in SAPO-34 was ascribed to the incorporation of Si atoms into the AlPO4-34 lattice. The high thermal stability of SAPO-34 was also proposed an important feature for ethane ODH at temperatures >600–700 °C.306 SAPO-34 catalysts exhibit high activity in ethane ODH, with side reactions such as oxidation and cracking significantly inhibited (relative to other zeolites like ZSM-5) by the framework morphology and acidity.307 Acidity of the resultant catalysts can be tuned by alkaline and alkaline earth metal ion incorporation into the SAPO-34 framework; 70% ethene selectivity at 45% ethane conversion was attained at 550–700 °C.306 Cr doped SAPO-34 have also been explored for ethane ODH, with 95% ethene selectivity at 40% ethane conversion reported.308 Ethene productivity was sensitive to the catalyst synthesis, with one-pot hydrothermal methods superior to incipient-wetness impregnation.
3.3 Mesoporous silicates
Mesoporous silicates, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15, are attractive materials for catalysis and sorption applications due to their high surface areas and in-pore accessibility of active sites. For catalysis, active sites can be either incorporated into the silica framework, or dispersed over the surface of pore channels.168 Insertion of transition metals into mesoporous MCM-type materials offers control over the distribution and stability of active sites for ethane ODH.309 MCM-41-supported vanadia is efficient in ethane ODH, with ethene yields of 11% and a selectivity of 39% at 600 °C. The catalytic performance and nature of vanadium species in MCM-41 depends on both the surface area and hydroxyl density of the support,310 and the vanadium loading,311 with an ethene selectivity of 50% at ethane conversion of 18% reported at 550 °C.
Comparison with other transition metals revealed that Cr-MCM-41 was highly effective for ethane ODH, whereas Co-MCM-41 was almost inert and Ni-MCM-41 was non-selective.309 Silica and porous clay heterostructures as supports for NiO provide active and selective catalysts for ethene production.312 It was inferred that PCH stabilised a high NiO dispersion, which coupled with the acidic support properties promoted ethane ODH (Fig. 31). The poor selectivity of Ni-MCM may reflect the formation of larger, more readily reducible nanoparticles.

Mesoporous SBA-15 (pore sizes from 4.6 to 30 nm) was also used as support for Ce,313 Cr314 and Cr–Ce,315 with ethene yields between 52–63% observed. Use of SBA-16, with a 3D interconnected pore network, as a support for MoOx316 and VOx,317 revealed Mo-SBA-16 favours isolated MoOx species compared to Mo/SBA-15, conferring higher ethene selectivity. The 3D mesoporous channels of SBA-16 are postulated to enhance ethane diffusion and hence catalyst performance. V/SBA-16 also exhibited superior activity than V/SBA-15 and V/SiO2 due to a higher concentration of isolated VOx species. Greater acidity of other silica supports, and the concomitant presence of V2O5 resulted in low VOx dispersion, visualised by SEM (Fig. 32).317

Mo/SBA-16 was only active >600 °C (∼650 °C), whereas V/SBA-16 achieved a 26% yield at 600 °C due to isolated oligomeric VOx sites. For high V loading (>1 mol%), selectivity decreased due to increasing catalyst acidity. The ethane ODH performance of various zeotypes is presented in Table S2 (ESI†).
4. Catalyst deactivation & regeneration
Understanding the impact of deactivation and regeneration is critical for optimising any catalytic process and is extensively reviewed.318 Deactivation of ODH catalysts can occur via poisoning or fouling by coking, thermal degradation by sintering or reduction, and desorption or sublimation of active phase/dopants (e.g. halide, alkali metals or MoOx species).37
Chlorine-containing catalysts are widely studied for ethane ODH, however, their stability is often poor due to loss of chlorine. Efforts to stabilise Cl-containing catalysts have focused on developing more stable and active materials that can operate at lower reaction temperature. Li–MgO–Cl materials find use as supports for several oxides, with Cl:Li atomic ratios ∼0.9 stable towards on-stream chlorine loss, attributed to the formation of a LiCl layer over MgO,319 capped by a thin layer of Li2O (observed by XPS) which is proposed the active phase. High stability can be maintained at 620 °C with a 58% yield of ethene over 50 h on-stream.319 Electronic perturbation of Li2O by LiCl is proposed to weaken the basicity and deactivation by Li2CO3 formation. After a small initial HCl loss, catalysts based on Sr doped bismuth chloride oxides (e.g. SrBi3O4Cl3) also maintain good selectivity for ethane ODH to ethene.320
The performance of silica supported alkaline-doped vanadates321 reveals that among Li, K, Na, Cs and Rb alkaline metals, the K-containing catalysts such as KVO3/SiO2 exhibit negligible deactivation during ethane ODH, although ethene selectivity is lower when using N2O as an oxidant. In contrast, NaVO3/SiO2 rapidly deactivated after only 2 h and could not be regenerated due to instability >450 °C. Alumina supported vanadates are suggested to deactivate during ethane ODH by AlVO4 formation, as a consequence of V3+ reduction on-stream.322 For silica supported alkali doped molybdates, catalyst deactivation occurs mainly by reduction, but regeneration is possible by re-oxidation of the MoOx species.323 Kinetic analysis of the impact of O2versus CO2 as oxidants for ethane ODH over MoOx/Al2O3, shows that deactivation constants correlate with the ease of oxidant activation and ability to remove carbon deposits.324 Heteropolyacids such as silica supported 12-molybdophosphoric acid also show moderate irreversible deactivation during ethane ODH reaction at 380 °C due to partial decomposition of the Keggin structure.325 Bi introduction into MoVNbTeO catalysts (Bi:Mo ratios of 0.0075–0.025) increased the standard space time yield (SSTY) from 0.08 to 0.12 g(C2H4) g(M1)−1 h−1 at 460 °C, and inhibited catalyst deactivation. After 3 h reaction, the ethene SSTY decreased by only 23% over catalysts with a Bi:Mo of 0.025, compared to a 42% drop without Bi. Reduction of tellurium species to Te0 was identified as responsible for catalyst deactivation, with Bi proposed to assist in retaining Te within the orthorhombic (M1) structure of MoVNbTeO, thereby hindering reduction and deactivation.326 It was speculated that Te reduction blocks active sites, promoting irreversible decomposition of the M1 structure and formation of MoO2 or Mo5O14 species.140,327,328
Kinetic analysis of ethane ODH over MoVNbTeO catalysts reveals consistency with Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW)329 rather than Mars-van Krevelen mechanisms. Ethene formation was strongly dependent on ethane partial pressure but independent on oxidant pressure.329 Modelling to estimate the oxygen content of metal oxides in the presence of molecular oxygen, suggests that only surface lattice oxygen participates in ethane ODH.330,331 Fluidised bed reactors are best suited to regenerate reduced metal oxides and hence prevent maintain ethane ODH activity.332–334
The stability of Ni–Nb–O catalysts during ethane ODH depends on Nb content, with catalysts containing >15 wt% Nb undergoing rapid deactivation in the first 20 h reaction at 350 °C.175 Deactivation reflected the formation of NiNb2O6, which reduced the availability of active oxygen species at the NiO surface,175,199 however, attempts to regenerate under air at 450 °C or higher temperatures proved unsuccessful.175 Loss of activity was attributed to a decrease in surface area accompanying NiNb2O6 formation.175 However, other groups working at reaction temperatures <400 °C observed no correlation between NiNb2O6 crystallisation and catalyst deactivation,199,335 with activity losses attributed to the formation of carbon deposits under kinetic control (400 °C and 40 cm3 min−1); deactivation was not observed after 240 h operation at 400 °C and 20 cm3 min−1 due to mass transfer limitations. The method of catalyst synthesis impacts Ni–Nb–O stability.199,200 Deactivation was independent of Nb content in catalysts prepared via solid-state methods, which retained 90% of their original activity after 50 h on-stream, whereas those prepared by conventional methods were unstable.200 Catalysts synthesised from nickel nitrate and ammonium niobate oxalate precursors by a combustion method were also more stable for 120 h on-stream than those prepared by evaporation.199 Incorporation of Cr into Ni–Nb–O appears to increase catalyst stability for 21 h at 420 °C,336 but longer benchmarking is necessary to confirm this observation.
Deactivation of doped ZSM-5 catalysts337 during ethane ODH depends on the dopant nature, with Ga and Ni particularly prone to forming carbonaceous deposits and exhibit low ethene selectivity. In contrast, Na/ZSM-5 and V/ZSM-5 are more active and selective for ethene production than the parent acidic H-ZSM-5, with steam addition to the feedstream further improving ethene selectivity by inhibiting cracking to methane.
5. Mechanistic aspects
5.1 Kinetic models of ethane ODH
The selective oxidation of short chain alkanes is hindered by competing reactions which promote combustion. Commercial realisation of alkane ODH requires deep understanding of the catalytic mechanisms and kinetically-favoured pathways to identify factors controlling selectivity-conversion relationships.338,339 Kinetic studies provide valuable information on key reaction steps, enhancing understanding of the macroscopic processes involved in ODH. Several such kinetic models for surface catalysed ethane ODH have been developed, including the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK),181,340 Langmuir–Hinshelwood (–Hougen–Watson) (LH(HW)),341,342,343,344 and Eley Rideal (ER) models,43,103 and combinations345 or modifications thereof,346 which implicate parallel or consecutive reaction pathways and the role of single or multiple active sites. Different catalyst formulations may follow different models: a MvK mechanism is suggested for a mixed Ni–Nb oxide, involving two active oxygen species; strongly bound lattice O2− species with nucleophilic character driving ethene production and combustion; and electrophilic surface O− promoting ethane combustion.181 A combined MvK–LHHW mechanism was advanced for VOx/Al2O3, with ethene formation following a MvK mechanism but ethane and ethene combustion followed a LHHW mechanism.345 This contrasts with K doped V2O5/SiO2, for which an ER mechanism is proposed wherein gas phase ethane directly reacts with adsorbed oxygen.43 Typical reaction steps for MvK, LHHW and combined MvK–LHHW mechanisms are shown in Table 4.329

According to the MvK model, labile oxygen species from the metal oxide lattice are responsible for ethene and COx formation, being replenished by gas phase oxygen. Variants of the MvK model considering one or two active sites participating in the same or different reaction steps have been considered for Nb/NiO catalysts.181 Kinetic modelling indicates two sites participate: one drives ethane ODH and ethene oxidation, and the other is active for ethane oxidation. The LHHW mechanism involves: (1) a single active site on the catalyst surface; (2) competitive adsorption of reactants (C2H6 and O2) and products (C2H4, CO2, CO and H2O) at the active site; (3) dissociative oxygen adsorption; (4) rapid surface reactions; (5) surface reactions are the rate-determining steps (RDS); (6) products may re-adsorb on active sites; and (7) a quasi-equilibrium is established between adsorption and desorption. The ER mechanism considers the reaction of gas phase ethane with lattice oxygen, with vacancies replenished by gaseous O2 to complete the catalytic cycle. Details of reaction kinetics for specific catalyst formulations and plausible mechanistic steps are provided in Section 5.3.
5.2 Mass and heat transfer limitations
Kinetic studies should be undertaken under experimental conditions which avoid mass and heat external/internal transfer limitations,347 such that criteria in eqn (38)–(41) are obeyed.329,348
a. Mass transfer limitations: (38) (39)b. Heat transfer limitations: (40) (41)where robs = observed rate, mmol (g h)−1, kg = mass transfer coefficient, m s−1, av = specific external surface area, m2 m−3, c = concentration, mol kg−1, m = partial reaction order for oxygen, Deff = effective diffusion coefficient, m2 s−1, dp = particle diameter, m, h = heat transfer coefficient (pellet and gas phase), kJ m−2 (K s)−1, ΔHr = reaction enthalpy, kJ mol−1, λp = particle conductivity, J (m s K)−1, Tf = fluid temperature, K.
Different strategies to avoid heat and mass transfer restrictions have been adopted, with interphase heat/mass transfer resistance avoided by ensuring the temperature difference between centre of the reactor and reactor wall is <100 °C.349 External and internal mass transfer limitations can also be prevented by using flow rates >150 cm3 min−1 and catalyst particles <100 μm, respectively.181 Use of powdered catalysts to avoid mass transfer limitations was also proposed,322,333 with porous structured alumina particles <60 μm avoiding intraparticle diffusion limitation.343 Thin film catalysts employing a 0.15 mm catalyst active layer can also minimise transport limitations.330 Reactions can also be maintained at low conversion <5% to avoid mass transport restrictions during micro-kinetic measurements.350 Limits for allowable temperature and concentration gradients which avoid mass transport limitations are detailed by Mears,348 and used in several studies to ensure measurements are obtained in the kinetic regime.103,268,351
5.3 Reaction mechanisms
Active site elucidation and probable pathways for alkene formation,352 have been explored by DFT and microkinetic models.353 Ethane ODH is widely accepted to occur via promotion of rate-limiting C–H bond cleavage by lattice or surface oxygen species possessing nucleophilic or electrophilic character respectively.339,345,354,355 Different pathways for C–H bond cleavage have been proposed including heterolytic, homolytic, ionic, and synchronous cleavage (eqn (42)–(46)).58,356
Homolytic dissociation: [O] + RH → [OH] + R˙(42)Heterolytic proton abstraction: [O2−] + RH → [O2−⋯H+] + R−(43)Heterolytic hydride ion abstraction: [Mn+] + RH → [Mn+⋯H−] + R+(44)Ionisation of alkane molecule: [H+] + RH → [H+⋯e−] + RH+(45)Synchronous abstraction of two hydrogen atoms: Mn+ + O2− + CnH2n+2 → [Mn+⋯Hδ−⋯CnH2n⋯Hδ+⋯O2−](46a) [Mn+⋯O2−⋯CnH2n⋯H2⋯O2−](46b) [M(n−2)+⋯[] + CnH2n + H2O](46c)
In ethane ODH, pathways associated with eqn (42), (43) and (45) are most commonly reported. For homolytic dissociation, the resulting alkyl radicals can participate in gas phase reactions at reaction temperature, or adsorption and β-H elimination over a catalyst surface to the alkene at lower temperature.357 Homolytic cleavage is favoured by high anion surface densities,358 as is the case for oxygen-terminated facets of metal oxides including rare-earths, alkalis,240,261 and vanadates.168,359 Stabilisation of an ethyl radical intermediate on monomeric vanadium sites has been explored by Sauer and co-workers using DFT calculations.360 For heterolytic C–H bond activation (eqn (43)) the proposed reaction pathway depends on the atomic arrangement of the active site, and can occur as a non-redox two-electron process over acid–base centres, a redox two-electron process, or for radicals via a redox one-electron process. Scheme 4 illustrates the C–H activation pathways for terminal metal oxo or μ-oxo groups, and isolated versus polynuclear groups. For a terminal oxo, insertion of C–H across the MO bond results in a metal hydride or alkyl intermediate (a and b in Scheme 4), while C–H activation favours alkoxy species (c in Scheme 4). C–H bond activation may also occur through hydrogen abstraction to form M–OH and a transient alkyl radical product (d and e). On bis-oxo groups, prevalent in MoOx systems, syn- and anti-paths are possible. DFT analysis on cluster models illustrate that the barrier to C–H activation over terminal oxo species is lower for the anti-conformation.361 H abstraction may also occur at μ-O bridge groups (see f) or at sites with adjacent bis-oxo groups (see g and h in Scheme 4).

Among factors influencing activity and selectivity in ethane ODH are the metal–oxygen bond strength, acid/base properties of the support, nucleophilic/electrophilic character of oxygen species, spatial proximity of active sites, cooperation between active phases, and olefin desorption.16,181,362–364 The nature of active oxygen species plays an important role in selectivity, with labile oxygen species and electrophilic oxygen (O−, O2− and O22−) promoting combustion reactions, whereas nucleophilic oxygen (O2−) promotes the selective conversion of ethane to ethene.181 Adsorbed O− is proposed by several authors323,365,366 as active for ethane activation. Table 5 summarises the different type of catalysts based on their postulated reaction mechanism and associated reactive oxygen species.

Most catalysts belonging to Group A are reducible transition metal oxides with lattice oxygen responsible for low temperature (T < 600 °C) activity. Catalysts from Group B are rare-earth oxides and have optimal reaction temperatures >600 °C wherein gas phase radicals formed by activated surface oxygen species dominate ethane conversion. For Group C, reaction temperatures >800 °C are often required, with noble metals (usually Pt) deposited on the metal oxide, and monoliths employed to promote ethene formation.58 The different optimum reaction conditions for each group reflects ethane ODH operating by different mechanisms (as previously outlined).
In addition to increasing the metal–oxygen bond strength of the redox active site,37 acidic supports enhance ethene desorption.362 Co-operativity between elements is reported for MoVTeNb catalysts, with V species the active site for C–H activation, whose activity is promoted by Mo. Te and Nb are structural promotors of the active and selective M1 phase.367 The following section summarises kinetic models determined for redox, non-redox, and noble metal supported catalysts.

5.3.1 Redox mechanisms on mixed metal oxides. 
A redox mechanism is the most widely proposed pathway for oxidation reactions catalysed by reducible transition metal oxides.342,368 The MvK mechanism involves the reaction of ethane with lattice oxygen in the metal oxide, which may render catalysts susceptible to over-reduction and consequent on-stream deactivation if the metal oxide is not re-oxidised by a gas phase oxidant.58,343 This mechanism requires a material with a redox couple and high electrical conductivity and oxygen lattice mobility to ensure re-oxidation of reduced sites.369,370 For catalysts possessing only one type of active site, if adsorption and desorption are in quasi-equilibrium, and surface reactions are rate-determining, then a LHHW reaction network is likely.330 Models determined for bulk and supported reducible metal oxides are now discussed.
5.3.1.1 Bulk reducible metal oxides. 
Different combinations of elementary steps have been explored for ethane ODH over Ni–Nb–O catalysts,181 which are well-described by the MvK model using eqn (4–10). TPD measurements indicated that C2H6 and C2H4 did not accumulate on the catalyst surface, however strong water adsorption appeared to inhibit the reaction. Nb promotes C–H bond cleavage by aiding electron transfer to NiO,174 and partially covering cationic Ni sites to form less labile and more nucleophilic oxygen sites, which are active and selective for ethane ODH.175,181 Indeed the rate of oxygen exchange for NiO is twice that of Nb–NiO between 400–500 °C.174,181 Temperature-programmed 18O isotope exchange experiments revealed Nb doping increased the activation energy for oxygen exchange from 115 to 176 kJ mol−1, and eliminated non-stoichiometric electrophilic oxygen species responsible for ethane combustion.175,181,186 There are also fundamental difference in surface re-oxidation, with NiO showing high levels of electrophilic surface oxygen species, attributed to fast O2 dissociation on cation vacancies and their slow diffusion into the lattice. Nb partially fills these cationic vacancies, hindering O2 dissociation, such that more strongly bound, nucleophilic oxygen species are favoured.181 These findings also account for the diminished reducibility of NiO with increasing Nb content, and explain why Ni–Nb–O oxide catalysts are less active, but more selective, than NiO in ethane ODH.175,186,194
DFT studies provide insight into how Nb electronically modifies the NiO surface to control oxygen vacancy formation and O2 dissociation.371 Nb is a high valence dopant, which in contact with NiO, increases the energy for oxygen vacancy formation in NiO(011) from 3.28 eV to 4.13 eV.372 O2 dissociatively chemisorbs at Nb sites forming NbO2 species that electronically perturb reactive oxygen. As shown in Fig. 33, NbO2 replaces a surface Ni2+, forming a Nb–O–Ni bond to an adjacent Ni site. This interaction with Ni weakens binding of O(A) which increases reactivity relative to Ni–O or Nb–O. Rapid ethane activation and C–H dissociation occur to yield ethoxide intermediates at O2− sites on NbO2 and hydroxyls at O2− sites (B) on NiO. Although these calculations predict NbO2-doped NiO is more effective at C–H bond cleavage than NiO, the roles of NbOx clusters or NiNb2O6 were not considered in the model.

An MvK type mechanism was recently proposed for NiO and Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox (Fig. 34),54 based on the active site for ethane ODH over NiO-based catalysts being an O− species, and heterolytic C–H cleavage occurring across Ni–O (Fig. 34a and b).

Low O− concentrations over Nb–NiO surfaces favour β-hydrogen elimination (Fig. 34c and d) and ethene production, whereas high O− densities over NiO surfaces (Fig. 34e and f) favour combustion. Desorption of water and re-oxidation of vacancies with O2 regenerates the catalyst surface completing the catalytic cycle.
Over vanadium oxides, ethane ODH commences with proton abstraction, which is the rate-limiting step.88,360,373 DFT calculations show that terminal MO species are more active for C–H bond activation than bridging M–O–M species.374,375 Stepwise reaction of MO with ethane forms M–OH and a transient alkyl radical intermediate, which can either bind at the resulting M–OH site, or migrate to another MO or M–O–M site for further dehydrogenation.360 Formation of water and ethene results in a surface oxygen vacancy, which is re-oxidised by gas phase oxygen.38Fig. 35 illustrates the activation of ethane during ODH over V2O5(001) which invokes a cooperative mechanism between neighbouring oxygen sites.375 Mechanism A shows the production of an ethoxide intermediate, with the liberated proton migrating to an adjacent lattice oxygen (see Scheme 4h). In mechanism B, H abstraction generates a gas phase ethyl radical which subsequently recombines with oxygen sites O(1), O(2) or O(3).376 C–H bond activation by a radical mechanism over the O(1) site is energetically favoured with a barrier of only 35 kcal mol−1, subsequent migration of the reactively-formed ethoxide to an O(2) site provides the lowest energy route to ethene. H abstraction from an ethoxide at O(1) is hampered by the large O(1)–O(2) separation ∼4.9 Å and hence faces a high energy barrier (71.2 kcal mol−1).

Homolytic ethane activation across adjacent O–Co–O sites is the most kinetically and thermodynamically favoured pathway over oxygen terminated Co3O4(111).377,378 The most probable catalytic redox cycle for ethane ODH suggested by DFT calculations is shown in Fig. 36. The lowest energy pathway for the second C–H activation is a heterolytic route liberating gaseous ethene. Hydrogen migration and water formation generates an oxygen vacancy that is replenished by gas phase O2. In contrast to experimental measurements,379 water formation was rate-determining, suggesting the degree of surface hydroxylation may affect the relative energy barriers for C–H activation and water formation.

In the case of MoVTeNbO, kinetics of ethane ODH are best described by the LHHW model,329 with strongly bound H2O inhibiting reactivity. Model refinements for reactions in a wall-cooled, packed-bed reactor incorporated hydrodynamics to explain the impact of coolant temperature on ethene yield. The resulting model accounted for a weak influence of oxygen partial pressure, the negative effect of strong water adsorption at active sites, and the substantial influence of inlet ethane partial pressure.330 Power law kinetic models have also been used to simulate ODH kinetics over MoVTeNbO; although these neglect mechanistic aspects of the surface chemistry they are useful for overall process development. Such analyses likewise reveal a low dependency of ethene yield on ethane and oxygen partial pressures, with kinetic orders of 1.46 and 0.17–0.43 respectively. CO2 was mainly formed from ethane, whereas CO originated from both ethane and ethene. The energy barrier for ethane ODH was only 119 kJ mol−1, significantly lower than that for ethene oxidation to CO (242 kJ mol−1).351
Other authors have used an Eley–Rideal (ER) model to describe ethane ODH over MoVTeNbO, in which ethane reacts from the gas phase380 (eqn (47)). While both LHHW and ER models were in reasonable agreement with experimental data, only the ER model correctly predicted the effect of ethane partial pressure on reactor hot spots at 452 °C and increased rates of COx formation.380 An Eley–Rideal-redox model was also developed to predict a reaction network for ethane ODH over MoV type catalysts.103 (47)
5.3.1.2 Supported reducible metal oxides. 
A combined LHHW–MvK model was proposed to account for the kinetics of different steps of the ODH reaction over VOx/Al2O3.345 Ethene formation from ethane was considered to follow the MvK mechanism, while remaining oxidation reactions followed a LHHW model. Eqn (13), the reaction of ethane with lattice oxygen was the RDS, with re-oxidation of the lattice needed to complete the catalytic cycle. A modified LHHW model has also been employed to describe processes involving subsurface oxygen, wherein a function to describe the degree of surface oxidation was related to surface oxygen coverage. Such an approach provides a good fit to the kinetics of ethane ODH over VOx/Al2O3 in a fluidised bed under O2-free cycles343 and in fixed bed reactors both with and without gaseous O2.381 Under O2-free conditions, competitive adsorption of C2H6, C2H4 and COx favoured the formation of sites selective for C2H4 production.343 Ethane ODH over VOx/Al2O3–ZrO2 under anaerobic conditions was modelled by a LH mechanism, in which ethene and ethane adsorb at lattice oxygen sites, whose availability dictates catalyst activity.331 This model accounts for the roles of lattice oxygen in ethene formation and surface oxygen for COx formation.
DFT calculations for silica supported vanadyl species using a OV(OH)3 model to simulate isolated VO4 units concluded a viable single site pathway exists (Fig. 37).360 In contrast, over MoO3 supported on TiO2 nanorods (Fig. 38)229 a mechanism was proposed in which C–H bond activation occurs heterolytically on the Lewis acid–base pair of Moδ+–Oδ−, resulting in the formation of an alkyl group bound to Mo. Subsequent β-hydrogen elimination and ethene and water formation occurs over Mo(O)OH+, with transfer of an electron pair leading to a Mo6+ to Mo4+ reduction,344 the latter re-oxidised by gaseous O2.

For ethane ODH over NiO/ZrO2–MgO, the MvK mechanism is suggested (Fig. 39)382 in which the initial C–H cleavage is followed by α- or β-hydrogen abstraction by NiO active oxygens, with the latter favouring ethene formation. M–O and M–□ represent oxidised and reduced nickel sites respectively. Surface acidity enhanced ethane binding and undesired C–C cleavage to form methane.

5.3.2 Non-redox processes on mixed oxides. 
5.3.2.1 Supported metal oxides and halides. 
Alkane dehydrogenation over supported chromium oxide catalysts occurs without oxygen, and as a consequence requires elevated temperatures and use of dopants,383 with catalysts periodically regenerated in oxygen to remove surface deposited coke.384 DFT calculations on silica supported mononuclear CrOx species (Scheme 5) illustrates a mechanism for ethane ODH over mononuclear Cr(III) sites. C–H activation begins when physisorbed ethane reacts with an unsaturated Cr3+ centre to create a new O–H group and Cr–alkyl bond. Ethene is generated following β-H transfer from the alkyl species to Cr, which is speculated as the RDS. Regeneration of Cr3+–O centres with concomitant H2 evolution completes the catalytic cycle. A parallel pathway potentially exists in which initial ethane activation yields a short-lived hydridochromium(III) centre, which may re-form a Cr-ethyl intermediate. For this catalytic cycle, C–H bond activation is rate-limiting, and the reaction is completed by β-H elimination at Cr and ethene desorption.385 This latter mechanism is very sensitive to the ability of the local Cr environment to stabilise the reactive hydridochromium(III) site relative to Cr species coordinated to three oxygen ligands. On silica, labile silanol species favour reforming the Cr–O bond, and hence operation of this alternative hydridochromium pathway depends on the degree of catalyst hydration. Isotope-labelling studies using D2 and monolabelled 13C-ethane indicate that the hydridochromium route operates over Cr/Al2O3. Only one H atom in ethane exchanged for D during ODH; in conjunction with evidence that ethane adsorption is the RDS for the ODH reaction, the observation that ethane exclusively engages in end-on activation supports operation of a hydridochromium pathway.386 Supported Cr(III) catalysts are frequently explored in CO2 assisted ODH387 due to their stability at temperatures >550 °C.388

5.3.2.2 Supported alkali oxides. 
The origin of LiCl promotion of MgO ethane ODH catalysts remains contentious. Ethane ODH is conducted at temperatures exceeding the melting point of LiCl, and hence the role of molten LiCl must be considered. DFT calculations have explored whether oxygen species such as LiOCl, LiOH, Li+O2− or Li2O could form during the reaction of O2 with liquid LiCl overlayers on MgO(100).389 Calculations suggest that oxygen species are not stable in bulk LiCl, and hence were discounted as possible reaction intermediates. However, such oxygen species and ethane/ethene were more stable over LiCl/MgO than MgO, in accordance with experiments.390Fig. 40 illustrates a possible reaction sequence wherein ODH activity depends on the redox potential of the metal oxide core and oxygen-containing Li species at the interface with a molten chloride shell.

5.3.3 Noble metal catalysts. 
High olefin selectivity at high ethane conversion arise for ethane:oxygen mixtures at very short contact times (∼10−4 s) and autothermal operation (900–1000 °C) in a ‘short contact time reactor’ (SCTR).77,272,391,392,393 Typical catalysts are supported Pt, Pd and Rh: Pt offers the highest ethene selectivity; Rh mainly produce syngas; while Pd is prone to coking. Initial studies by Huff and Schmidt393 reported selectivities reaching 70% at 80% ethane conversion for an ethane:O2 molar ratio of 1.7 over Pt/Al2O3. Ethene selectivity was improved by co-feeding H2 and using a Pt–Sn catalyst.394
Possible reaction mechanisms for noble metal catalysts include: (i) a surface catalysed heterogeneous mechanism, wherein ethene forms by β-hydrogen elimination from an ethyl intermediate; (ii) a homogeneous gas-phase radical mechanism; or (iii) a combined mechanism involving gas phase radical initiated ethane dehydrogenation, and surface catalysed oxidation of reactively formed H2. Computational studies391 suggest surface reactions are responsible for CO, CO2 and H2O formation over Pt from the oxidation of surface carbon and hydrogen generated during ethane adsorption and decomposition, alongside both heterogeneous and homogenous ethane ODH. Exothermic combustion causes a substantial temperature rise in some reactors (to ∼1000 °C) which drives endothermic gas and surface ethane ODH.270,391Fig. 41 shows a 2D contour plot of temperature and reactant/product profile across a monolithic reactor; activity is greatest where the reactor is hottest.

The temperature decreases toward the middle of the bed owing to the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation process. While some ethene was predicted to form from heterogeneous reactions, this was a minor pathway. H2 addition to the inlet feed of ethane increases ethene selectivity while maintaining high ethane conversion. Simulations and experiments suggest the improved selectivity arises from preferential hydrogen versus carbon oxidation, inducing a sharp drop in CO and CO2 formation. The high exothermicity of the H2 + ½O2 ↔ H2O (−241.8 kJ mol−1) reaction also enhances local heat transfer to the gas phase, promoting homogeneous ethane ODH. Changes in the feed composition also influence ethene selectivity, wherein the highest reported ethene selectivity was obtained for a feed mixture of C2H6:H2:O2 = 2:2:1.391


5.3.4 Zeolite supported metal oxides. 
Kinetic models for ethane ODH over Ni/K–Y are proposed to follow a LHHW mechanism395,396 in which ethane is activated over NiO to form a metal–ethoxide species and surface –OH.395 The metal ethoxide reacts further via α-H or β-H to form an aldehyde or C2H4, with the latter promoted by Brønsted acid sites from the zeolite (Fig. 42). Kinetic modelling indicated396 that increased reactor temperatures (450–600 °C) favoured ethene formation due to strong adsorption. Elevated temperatures (600 °C) combined with an efficient coolant to remove hot spots enhanced ethene yields from 9 to 52%.

6. CO2 assisted ethane ODH
CO2 can act as a mild oxidant to assist ethane ODH (CO2-ODH), (eqn (50)). CO2 dissociation to CO + O assists ethane dehydrogenation (eqn (48)) by limiting over-oxidation of ethane, with the added benefit of valorizing CO2 to CO, and also limit explosion risks.397,398–400 Recent reviews have highlighted how CO2-ODH over tailored bifunctional catalysts offers opportunities to produce alkenes while valorising a greenhouse gas.397 Such a process would require coupling of ethane dehydrogenation (DHE) with the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) (eqn (49)) reaction, and necessitates catalysts able to activate C–H bonds and reduce CO2 at low temperature, while retaining C–C bonds. Some reports also claim there is a parallel route via support reduction (eqn (51)) and re-oxidation by CO2 (eqn (52)). CnH2n+2 ↔ CnH2n + H2 DHE(48) CO2 + H2 ↔ CO + H2O RWGS(49) CnH2n+2 + CO2 ↔ CnH2n + CO + H2O overall(50) [O]S + CnH2n+2 → CnH2n + H2O + []S(51) []S + CO2 → CO + [O]S(52)
Several promising catalysts have been explored for CO2-ODH based on Ni and Ni–Fe, including Fe/NiMgZrOx with 20–30% C2H4 yield at 600 °C and CO2:C2H6 molar ratio of 1.2.401 Ni1Fe3/CeO2 has also been explored, with a balance of Ni–FeOx and Ni–CeOx interfaces for ODH and dry reforming respectively being optimal for ethene production.402
Cr2O3 based catalysts are also widely explored for CO2-ODH,403 with CO formation reported from surface carbon oxidation.399 Reaction of ethane over CrOx supported on ZSM-5 and Ga2O3/HZSM-5 shows an increase in C2H6 conversion for a CO2:C2H6 molar ratio of 5 due to promotion of the RWGS reaction.404,405 Cr/SBA-15–Al2O3/FeCrAl exhibits a high ethene yield of 64%, albeit at 750 °C operation, via a Cr6+ ↔ Cr3+ redox cycle coupled with ethane dehydrogenation and CO2 reduction.314
Comparison of Cr2O3/ZrO2 and Cr2O3/TiO2 nanocatalysts revealed an increase in CO2-ODH with surface area (smaller particle size) for co-precipitated Cr-based catalysts.406 ZrO2 supports generated a favourable distribution of active sites and resulting 43% ethene yield, surpassing that of TiO2 supported catalysts.406 Use of γ-Al2O3, CeO2, ZrO2 and CexZr(1−x)O2 supports influenced the state and stability of CrOx species and corresponding CO2-ODH perfomance.407 CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 are the most active, with CrOx/CeO2 less active but more stable, attributed to differences in the stabilisation of Cr5+/6+ species. All supports except CeO2 stabilised poly- or mononuclear Cr5+/6+ species, whereas CeO2 formed non-selective α-Cr2O3 and only trace levels of Cr5+/6+ (Fig. 43).407 Despite the high activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2, their proposed reaction pathways significantly differ.407 CrOx/γ-Al2O3 operates via ethane dehydrogenation coupled with the CO2 RWGS (eqn (48) and (49)), whereas CrOx/ZrO2 follows a combined MvK–LHHW model (eqn (25) and (26)). However, re-oxidation of chromia by CO2 is not facile, resulting in rapid deactivation of CrOx/ZrO2. Hence CrOx/γ-Al2O3 is the more robust catalyst.407

Cobalt catalysts are also active for CO2-DHE, with Co doped Na2WO4/Mn/SiO2 exhibiting 91% ethene selectivity at 60% ethane conversion and 750 °C.408 For Co–BaCO3, Co4+–O is proposed to activate ethane at 650 °C in the presence of CO2, leading to a 44% ethene yield.409 Incorporation of 0.25 wt% boron further improved the catalyst performance due to optimised acid–base properties and smaller Co3O4 crystallites.222 Surface doping of Co3O4 with transition metals or non-metals like Ge and Si, and control over the exposed crystal facet are important in dictating ethene productivity. Oxygen-terminated Co3O4(111) facets provide the highest density of active oxygen species, being able to support oxygen vacancies without any structure loss.378 Flame spray pyrolysis can generate Al2O3, SiO2, ZrO2 and TiO2 supported single and binary CoOx oxides,410 with CoOx/SiO2, CoOx/ZrO2 and CoOx/TiO2–ZrO2 the most promising for CO2-ODH (Fig. 44). The density and strength of acid sites, and reducibility of cobalt oxide species are key characteristics of mixed oxides influencing CO2-ODH.

Ca-doped ceria catalysts are >90% selective in CO2-ODH, with 22% ethene yields reported. A Ce4+/Ce3+ couple was proposed for CO2 activation, with requisite oxygen species formed at 650–727 °C.411–413 Au supported on CeO2 nanorods (CeR) and nanoparticles (CeP) has also been explored, with Au/CeR exhibiting 90% ethene selectivity at 17% ethane conversion over 6 h.414 Au promotes CeO2 reduction and ethane activation, with CO2 crucial to suppress coke formation during the RWGS reaction (Fig. 45).414

Zeolitic catalysts have also been explored for CO2-ODH, with Cr/titanosilicate-1 (TS-1) offering 90% ethene selectivity and an ethene yield of 48% at 650 °C,415 and Cr/Clinoptilolite416,417 ∼100% selective to ethene at 19% ethane conversion at 700 °C.416 A Clinoptilolite–ZrO2 composite also showed promise,417 however, the best performance was observed for 10 wt% ZrO2/ZSM-5 with a 53% ethene yield reported at 700 °C.418 Thermodynamic analysis shows that temperatures >550 °C are essential to drive tandem dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions (Fig. 46),402 with a maximum equilibrium ethene yield of 85% predicted for a CO2:C2H6 molar ratio of 20:1, highlighting scope for further improvements in CO2-ODH.

7. Conclusions
The conversion of light alkanes to their corresponding alkenes is challenging from both economic and scientific perspectives, with considerable effort required to develop more sustainable and economically viable processes to reduce the carbon footprint of current routes to ethene production. Nevertheless, selective C–H bond activation of alkanes has attracted significant research attention. The initial catalytic activation of an alkane C–H bond necessitates an affinity between the molecule and catalyst surface, with acid–base interactions between alkanes and oxides enhancing molecular access to the requisite active sites. Acid/base properties of oxide surfaces depend on the cation charge and radius, with high valent cations associated with acidic oxides, and low valent cations resulting in nucleophilic oxygen species and more basic oxides. Ethane ODH requires activation of both alkane and oxidant. When the latter is molecular oxygen then a reducible metal oxide is preferred, however activation over non-reducible oxides does occur, but typically requires dopants to create reducible sites. Non-reducible catalysts operate at higher reaction temperatures which in turn promote gas phase reactions.37
Although redox catalysts can exhibit promising ethane ODH activity, they also promote combustion and hence lower selectivity towards ethene. Multiple, often inter-related parameters influence ethane ODH: catalyst reducibility, acid–base properties, metal oxide–support interactions, synthesis method, type, amount and method of dopant addition, reaction temperature, and feed gas composition. For instance, ethene selectivity is promoted by alkalis such as K, and sensitive to catalyst acid–base properties (themselves a function of support choice). Catalyst activity is strongly dependent on the type of oxygen species present. Nucleophilic lattice oxygen and electrophilic oxygen at the catalyst surface are also critical. In general, adsorbed oxygen promotes combustion whereas nucleophilic oxygen atoms promote selective oxidation. At low temperature, and in the presence of reducible oxides, the MvK pathway is believed responsible for the ODH of light alkanes. Lattice oxygen reacts with light alkanes and surface intermediates, thereby reducing the catalyst surface, with subsequent reoxidation by gaseous molecular oxygen to complete the catalytic cycle. Halogens can modify the distribution of surface oxygen species by occupying oxygen vacancies, hampering the generation of O− species and in turn suppressing ethane combustion.
Zeolites are versatile catalysts for thermal reactions due to their tunable Lewis and Brønsted acid–base properties, which can by adjusted by varying the Si:Al ratio and/or doping. Dopants such as Ga, Cd and Zn enhance Lewis acid–base properties, alkali and alkaline cations increase basic properties of lattice oxygen, and multivalent cations such as Fe, Cu, Co, Mo and V promote redox reactions. The ODH mechanism over zeolite catalysts remains relatively poorly understood, with the active sites for ethane activation contentious.369 Zeolites have found application in CO2-assisted ethane ODH, which mitigates hazards associated with the use of explosive ethane:oxygen mixtures.369,398,419 Molecular sieves supporting Cr catalysts show the greatest ethene productivity from CO2-ODH.296,297,308,314,411,416–418 Cr supported on Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2 and ZrO2, SiO2 are also promising for CO2-ODH,420,421 as are Ce-313,411 and Co263,409 oxides.
A quantitative comparison of ethane ODH performance over all catalysts is provided in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†), with selected examples summarised in Fig. 47. In addition to the catalyst formulation and operating conditions, the choice of reactor configuration also influences performance. The highest conversion (>80%) and selectivity (>85%) can be observed for LiCl–Dy–Mg–O259 entry (22) in Table S1 (ESI†) and MoV0.31Te0.2Nb0.14Ox (32).132 Comparison of entries 63, 24, 27, 32 and 59 from a family of Mo–V–X mixed oxides (wherein X = Nb, Te, Sb or a mix of these dopants) reveal the sensitivity of ethane ODH to catalyst composition, crystallisation/reaction temperature and ability of X to stabilise the M1 phase. This is neatly illustrated for MoV0.31Te0.2Nb0.14Ox wherein increasing the reaction temperature from 380 °C to 600 °C increases the ethene yield from 38% entry (27) to 78% entry (32).99,137 Although the ethene yield for LiCl–Dy–Mg–O is extremely impressive at ∼80%, this was obtained from light-off studies, whereas steady state measurements over 40 h on-stream reveal lower yields of 40–60% due to Cl loss (critical for promoting the radical ODH mechanism). MoV0.31Te0.2Nb0.14Ox thus represents the most promising, stable catalyst for ethane ODH to date.
 Fig. 47  Catalytic ethane ODH. Numbers in the figure refer to entries in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†). 
In the mid-yield (40–70%) range, ethene selectivity >90% is achievable for diverse catalysts when using O2 as an oxidant, including RbMg/NaY–La(Cl) entry (96) in Table S1 (ESI†),422 MoV0.39Te0.16Nb0.17Ox (27),108 BaCl2/TiO2/SnO2 (59)248 and LiSrDy2O3/MgO (38),262 or with CO2 as an oxidant as for CrAPSO (95),308 CoBaCO3 (39),409 5%CoOx/MgAl2O4 (53),263 Cr/ZrO2 (71),406 5%Cr/10%Ce/SBA-15 (89),315 and (90) 5%Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl.314 Despite the impressive results for CO2-ODH, these catalysts require operating temperatures 300–400 °C higher than those for conventional ODH.
Low ethene yields (<40%) are reported for Ga/Cr–ZrP entry (9),423 α-Sb2O4/Mo–V–O (10)96 and pyridine-exchanged Nb0.5PMo11GaPyr (30).129 Although these permitted moderate temperature (400–500 °C) operation, ethene production was limited by redox properties of the active phase, highlighting the challenge of maintaining active sites in the desirable oxidation state. Dopants improved selectivity, by assisting with re-oxidation, but also lowered activity. A second grouping of catalysts operated with high selectivity (>90%) but low conversion (<10%), wherein side reactions of ethene typically led to deactivation such as for M1 MoV6.6SbNbOx entry (63),139 Mo0.71V0.21Nb0.08Ox (24),424 Pt–Sn/Mg(Al)O (under H2) (48)265 and (40) Pt–Sn/Mg(Al)O (under H2/CO2).268 Metal catalysts operating at high temperature (>600 °C) under non-oxidative dehydrogenation conditions, with co-fed H2, CO2 or CO2/H2 as a reactant feed (entries 48 and 40) also delivered high selectivity at low conversion. Catalyst lifetimes could be improved by the reaction of H2 or CO2 with coke precursors, with Sn hypothesised to inhibit ethene binding and subsequent hydrogenation. However, such metal and mixed oxide catalysts remain prone to significant deactivation by coking. The best performing zeolite entry (96), relies on radical activation pathways promoted by LaCl, with the NaY zeolite likely acting as a largely inert support.
The best laboratory performance is approaching that required for industrial operation,99 however further efforts are necessary to improve catalyst lifetime, and scale-up and optimise the process, notably to permit the use of commercially available impure hydrocarbon feedstocks.425
Environmental impacts must also be considered. Many of the halogen containing catalysts are problematic due to halide loss under reaction conditions, and the use of Earth scare elements presents a sustainability challenge. Element sustainability is of growing concern in the Green Chemistry arena;426 with only 50–100 years supply of Te, Nb and Mo estimated based on current extraction rates. Sb is an at-risk element, with only 5–50 years of global supply remaining, while V is relatively abundant with 100–500 years of supply predicted. Although X dopants are only used at low levels (1–3 at%) in Mo–V–X mixed oxides, market fluctuations in the costs of raw materials could significantly influence commercial viability of ODH processes based on these. In particular, as rare elements such as Te becomes ‘technology-critical’,427 there is concern that little is known about the environmental impact of Te.428,429 Recovery and recycling of rare elements from spent ODH catalysts, as is common practice for platinum group metal catalysts, will thus become important. In situ reduction of Te can also result in metal loss during catalyst activation and on-stream ODH operation for reaction temperatures >500 °C.328 The patent literature therefore favours the promotion of intrinsically less active MoVSb formulations with Nb, W, Sn, Cu or K.430 Even though the availability of Sb is classed at-risk, it is 40 times more abundant in the Earth's crust than Te, and mined at a larger scale. Efforts to stabilise Te through the addition of promotors such as Bi143 or Ce144 could prove fruitful to enable lower reaction temperatures. A MoVTeNbCeO-0.1 catalyst is reported to deliver 56% ethane conversion at 95% ethene selectivity for 200 h on-stream.144 Process economics and safety considerations for ethane ODH over mixed metal oxide MoVTeNbOx catalysts have been extensively reviewed,431 highlighting the potential benefits of eliminating an inert diluent and using CO2 as the oxidant.
8. Future trends
Over the past decade, considerable steps have been made to investigate new catalysts for ethane ODH, with ethene yields for selected catalysts similar to or exceeding those achieved by steam cracking. Substantial efforts should therefore be devoted to assessing both the optimal catalyst formulation and reactor design, which are the key factors influencing the ethene yield. This review highlights the promise of redox catalysts for ethane ODH, due to their high selectivity for ethane to ethene; however, they promote ethane combustion in parallel.432 Boron nitride (BN), with a graphene-like structure, has also attracted recent attention for ethane ODH, but does not follow a redox mechanism, with ethane dissociation likely occurring via H abstraction from B–OH to form B–O (assisted by O2).433–435 Zeolite Lewis acid sites are also active for ethane ODH, and metal doped analogues may provide future opportunities to improve ethane ODH from impure feedstreams through selective in-pore diffusion and sorption.
Dopants play a critical role in many ODH catalysts, and judicious selection of the correct type and concentration will continue to bear fruit. For example, sulfate modification of NiAl mixed oxide catalysts was recently employed to control oxygen speciation and increase ethene selectivity; an approach also applicable to CO2-assisted ethane dehydrogenation.436 Indeed, sulfated metal oxides have attracted much interest for low temperature alkane C–H activation,437 and based on early reported successes in ethane ODH438,439 merit revisiting. Three dimensional ordered macroporous materials (3DOM) could also prove beneficial for enhancing in-pore mass transport during ethane ODH, following recent reports of such benefits for NiCe440 and VMgO441 catalysts in propane ODH. High surface area macroporous–mesoporous hierarchical materials such as MM-SBA-15 are also worthy of investigation as supports for metal oxide active phases, having shown promise in stabilising conformal hydrotalcite442 and ZrO2 thin films443 and MgO nanoparticles,443 all potential active phases in ODH catalysis.
Photocatalysis is another emerging technology for C–H bond activation, enabling ethane ODH driven by solar energy under mild conditions.444 A mechanism for photocatalytic ethane ODH was proposed based on FTIR and ESR studies supported by DFT calculations (Fig. 48). Accordingly, photoinduced holes, electrons and OH radicals play a prominent role.

Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) is another emerging technology that affords a lower oxidant demand. Herein, a gas feed of alternating composition supplied to a redox catalyst, with ethene produced under an 80% ethane/argon cycle concurrent with the consumption of lattice oxygen. This lattice oxygen is subsequently replenished during oxidation under a 17% oxygen/argon cycle.445–448 CL-ODH is particularly attractive because it avoids the use of potentially explosive ethane-oxygen gas mixtures, or air separation units, making the overall process safer than conventional ODH. A similar concept can be implemented using coupled fluidised beds comprising (i) an ODH reactor and (ii) a catalyst regenerator, with catalyst particles periodically circulated between the reactors.53 Kinetic modelling of the redox characteristics of ethane ODH VOx/Al2O3332,343, VOx/Ce–Al2O3334 and VOx/Al2O3–ZrO2331 catalysts have highlighted the advantages of bench scale mini-fluidised bed reactors. Limitations of conventional thermal ODH can be overcome by microwave heating (MW) to activate catalysts without heating the reactive gas (Fig. 49). This local heating can help to decouple homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions.27 The potential of direct MW heating for ethane ODH was demonstrated for BaO–CeO2–ZrO2 and BaCl2–TiO2–SnO2 catalysts, enabling suppression of gas phase reactions and thereby inhibiting ethene over-oxidation and combustion.449

Another opportunity for ethane ODH is the design of an integrated process to selectively produce ethene for chemicals use and electricity through separating the ethane dehydrogenation and oxygen reduction steps across a fuel cell (Fig. 50). The system efficiency depends on the ratio of ionic (proton or oxide ions) versus electronic conductivity of the membrane and electrolytes. Only ionic conductivity is required for fuel cell operation wherein electronic conductivity occurs through an external load to complete the cell circuit.446,450–454 Use of a proton-conducting electrolyte permits olefin and electricity co-generation without CO2 emission.455,456

Commercial implementation of catalytic ODH also requires a more comprehensive fundamental understanding of the many, often competing, reaction pathways and the influence of promoters and poisons upon these, including microkinetic modelling to unequivocally establish the rate-determining step over different catalysts under different reaction conditions. To this end, further in situ and operando studies of surface (e.g. oxide dispersion, and concentration of nucleophilic versus electrophilic oxygen species) and bulk (e.g. M1 phase stability and lattice oxygen mobility) properties are required to derive quantitative structure–reactivity relationships, and to support quantum chemical modelling to identify active sites and deactivation pathways (e.g. coking, oxide over-reduction and phase separation) and thereby better understand the on-stream evolution of redox and acid–base properties. Artificial intelligence approaches, including machine learning, will help to establish universal descriptors to enable the rapid computational screening of the vast potential catalyst space (such as penternary compounds like MoVTeNbCeO-0.1) to identify promising formulations for synthesis and testing.457
Ultimately, the development of next-generation ODH catalysts should occur in concert with reactor design. A shift in focus from conventional packed-bed configurations to e.g. staged oxidant addition,221 membrane reactors,458 or swing bed reactors and chemical looping331,459 will enable more efficient and intrinsically safer oxidant delivery and product separation, paving the way to industrial implementation of ethane ODH.
