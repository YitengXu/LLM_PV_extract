    , Accepted 13th February 2018First published on 13th February 2018AbstractIn this paper, systematic halogen doping of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly bulk single crystals that were grown in mixed organic solvents via the ITC (inverse temperature crystallization) method was performed. X-ray diffraction measurement results show that the lattice constants of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals change linearly with the x(y) values. For the CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx crystals, cubic to tetragonal phase transformation was observed where the iodine content reaches a certain level. The comparison of UV-vis-NIR absorption and PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals shows that their absorption coefficients are contributed by direct and indirect bandgap transitions. Three kinds of mechanisms were involved in their radiative recombination, including direct emission, indirect emission and direct–indirect coexisting emission. The CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 1.64, 2.39, 2.81, 2.9) crystals were considered to be indirect band gap materials, since their band edges can be divided into two regions by a turning point. TG analysis shows that the beginning decomposition temperature of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals decreases with increasing x(y) values. Research on CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly single crystals would be helpful to reveal the inherent properties of perovskite materials.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials CH3NH3PbX3 (X = halide) have attracted great interest due to their superior optical and electrical properties. Solar cells based on these materials have the advantages of low cost, self-assembly, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), etc.1,2 Since the first organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cell was reported, the PCEs have been upgraded from 3.81% to 22% within a few years.3–5
For CH3NH3PbX3 materials, three lattice sites, namely, CH3NH3, Pb, and X, can be replaced or doped.6–8 Mixed-halide perovskites CH3NH3PbX3, in which the X sites are substituted with different halogen ions, are also hot research issues owing to their changeable band gap, the long diffusion lengths of charge carriers, their excellent photoelectric properties, etc. Via halogen doping, the band gap of the mixed-halide perovskites CH3NH3PbX3 can be regulated almost in the whole visible region.8,9 Compared CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx with CH3NH3PbI3, the former has higher efficiency and stability.8 Compared with CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx shows an increasing diffusion length of carriers from 100 nm to over 1 μm,10 and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly shows a VOC 0.2 V higher than that of CH3NH3PbBr3.11 The mechanism of performance improvement caused by the halogen doping of these materials is an important issue to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, most of these studies were based on mixed-halide perovskite CH3NH3PbX3 films, and their performance would be affected by the surface defects of the films. In order to study the inherent properties of mixed-halide perovskites, high quality mixed-halide CH3NH3PbX3 single crystals are required.
Experimental section
Crystal growth of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx
First, CH3NH3I and PbI2 (1:1 molar ratio) and CH3NH3Br and PbBr2 (1:1 molar ratio) with a PbI2:PbBr2 molar ratio equal to 60:1, 30:1, 10:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, respectively, were dissolved in mixed solvents of DMF–GBL at 70 °C. The volume ratios of DMF:GBL are the same as the molar ratios of PbBr2:PbI2. Then, the solutions were heated and kept at 100 °C to grow CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx crystals. The samples were numbered as shown in Table 2.
Crystal growth of CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly
First, CH3NH3Br and PbBr2 (1:1 molar ratio) and CH3NH3Cl and PbCl2 (1:1 molar ratio) with a PbCl2: PbBr2 molar ratio equal to 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, respectively, were dissolved in mixed solvents of DMSO–DMF at room temperature. The volume ratios of DMSO:DMF are the same as the molar ratios of PbCl2:PbBr2. Then, the solutions were heated and kept at 80 °C to grow CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction was performed using a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 5–90° with a step size of 0.02°. The steady-state absorption spectra were recorded using a DUV-3700 spectrophotometer in the range of 200–1500 nm. The steady-state fluorescence spectra were measured using a FLUOROLOG-3-TAU spectrophotometer. Energy dispersive X-ray spectra were obtained using an X-Max instrument. TG-DSC curves were obtained using a NETZSCH STA 449F3 thermal gravimetric analyzer. All the experiments were performed at room temperature.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and crystal growth
The inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method is often used to grow those crystals whose solubility in a certain solvent decreases with increasing temperature.12,13 In this paper, the ITC method was used to grow CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly bulk single crystals. Firstly, CH3NH3PbX3 forms a complex with the solvent at a lower temperature after dissolving a large amount of CH3NH3PbX3 in the solvent, and the solubility of CH3NH3PbX3 is dependent on the strength of the coordination bonds of CH3NH3PbX3–solvent. However, the coordination bonds of CH3NH3PbX3–solvent would be broken by rising temperature, and more CH3NH3PbX3 separated out to form crystals.14–16 Compared with the cooling solution method, the ITC method has the advantages of a shorter crystal growth cycle, ease of growing higher-quality crystals, etc.12,13
The choice of solvents is very important for the ITC method. In previous reports, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and γ-butyrolactone (GBL) were used to grow CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3 crystals, respectively.12,13 If their solvents were exchanged, neither CH3NH3PbBr3 nor CH3NH3PbI3 crystals can be grown by the ITC method. CH3NH3PbBr3 can hardly be dissolved in GBL. Although the solubility of CH3NH3PbI3 in DMF is greater than that in GBL, no reverse solubility occurs, which should be due to the strength of coordination bonds in CH3NH3PbI3–DMF being too strong.
For the growth of CH3NH3PbCl3 crystals, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and DMSO–DMF were often used as solvents.12,17 Under the same conditions, the solubility of CH3NH3PbCl3 in DMSO–DMF is lower than that in the DMSO solvent, indicating that the strength of the coordination bonds of CH3NH3PbCl3–DMSO is reduced by adding DMF. The flow diagram of the ITC method is shown in Fig. 1. The CH3NH3PbCl3 crystal growth process shows that using the mixed solvent possibly makes the process of perovskite crystal growth more adjustable. In order to verify this conjecture, under the same growth conditions, DMF was replaced by GBL to grow the CH3NH3PbCl3 crystal, and its crystallization temperature became lower. Meanwhile, using DMSO–GBL to grow the CH3NH3PbBr3 crystal, an inverse solubility phenomenon was observed. By changing the ratios of the mixed solvent, the crystallization temperature and the nucleation rate would be controlled. In our work, different volume ratios of DMF–GBL and DMSO–DMF were used to grow CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals, respectively.
 Fig. 1  Flow diagram of the ITC method with different solvents. 
The growth mechanism by the ITC method shows that the x(y) values of the final products would be different when different ratios of the solvents are used. To prove that the values of x(y) are related to the ratios of mixed solvents, the solutes CH3NH3I/PbI2 (1/1 molar ratio) and CH3NH3Br/PbBr2 (1/1 molar ratio) with a molar ratio of PbBr2:PbI2 = 1:2 were dissolved in DMF–GBL mixed solvents with volume ratios of 1:1 and 1:2, in order to grow CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx crystals. The EDX results show that the x values of the final products are 1.15 and 1.64, respectively. Mixed solvents of DMF and GBL have different combining capacities with CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbI3; as a result, when the solvent ratios change, the values of x in the final products will also change. In our experiments, the volume ratios of DMF:GBL of the DMF–GBL mixed solvents were always equal to the molar ratios of PbBr2:PbI2.
Halogen content

Fig. 2 shows the grown colorful crystals of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly by the ITC method. The proportion of halogen elements in the final products determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) is shown in Table 1. Most Pb:X (X = I–Br or Br–Cl) compositions are near the stoichiometric ratio 1:3 for CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals. According to the EDX results in Table 2, the values of x(y) in CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals were obtained using eqn (1) to compensate for the systematic error: (1)where I(at%), Br(at%), Cl(at%) represent the measured atom composition by EDX. The X(nominal) and Y(nominal) values in Table 2 and Fig. 3 represent the values of x(y) assuming that the following chemical reactions take place according to the ratios of raw materials. CH3NH3X + PbX2 → CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl)(2) (3 − x)CH3NH3PbI3 + xCH3NH3PbBr3 → 3CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx(3) (3 − y)CH3NH3PbBr3 + yCH3NH3PbCl3 → 3CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly(4)

 Fig. 3  The x(y) values for the CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals. 
The values of X(nominal), Y(nominal) are always different with the values of x(y) determined by EDX, indicating that more factors, such as the solvent, the solvent ratio, crystallization temperature, etc., would influence the crystallization process.
Crystal structure

Fig. 4a and b show the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals. From CH3NH3PbI3 to CH3NH3PbBr3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 to CH3NH3PbCl3, the overall XRD patterns show a right-shift tendency, indicating that the lattice varied with different halogen ions. Fig. 4c shows the magnified XRD patterns in the range of 28° < 2θ < 31.5°. According to the Bragg diffraction equation (2dsinθ = nλ), the two peaks at 2θ = 28.2° and 28.4° for the CH3NH3PbI2.98Br0.02 crystal and 2θ = 28.3° and 28.5° for the CH3NH3PbI2.9Br0.1 crystal should belong to the (004)T and (220)T crystal face of the tetragonal phase, indicating that the two crystals have a tetragonal structure. For the other CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 0.24, 0.73, 1.64, 2.39, 2.81, 2.9) and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly (y = 0.92, 1.33, 2, 2.52, 2.69) crystals, the single peak in this range should belong to the (200)C crystal face of the cubic phase, indicating that these crystals have a cubic structure. For CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly and CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx crystals, both of the locations of the (200)C peak increase with increasing x(y) values, as shown in Fig. 4d, and the trend is more obvious for CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx crystals. These results should be due to the fact that the difference in ionic radius between Br− (0.195 nm) and I− (0.22 nm) is larger than that between Br− (0.195 nm) and Cl− (0.181 nm). The lattice parameters of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals are shown in Fig. 4e. For the tetragonal phase (CH3NH3PbI2.98Br0.02, CH3NH3PbI2.9Br0.1), the structure was treated as a pseudo-cubic phase by treating (110)T, (200)T, (202)T, (220)T, (310)T, and (312)T as (100)p-c, (110)p-c, (111)p-c, (200)p-c, (210)p-c, and (211)p-c, and the lattice parameters were calculated by using the Bragg diffraction equation (2dsinθ = nλ) with the 2θ position at (100)p-c, (110)p-c, (111)p-c, (200)p-c, (210)p-c, and (211)p-c. It shows that the lattice parameters of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals decrease with the increase of the x(y) values.18,19

Optical properties

Fig. 5a shows the UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectra of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals. The bandgap values were obtained on the basis of the Tauc plot as the intercept value of the plot of (αhν)2 or (F(R∞)hν)2 against light energy hν,12 as shown in Fig. 5b. As the values of x(y) increase, the band gap values of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly also increase gradually. By fitting the two curves in Fig. 5c, two equations were obtained: Eg(CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx) = 1.556 + 0.205x + 0.007x2(5) Eg(CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly) = 2.3 + 0.1y + 0.041y2(6)

The relations reported are as follows: (7) (8)where MA = CH3NH3, Eg is the bandgap and b is the bowing parameter.8,20,21
The Eg values calculated from our fitting equations (eqn (5) and (6)) are in good agreement with those from the above equations (eqn (7) and (8)).22
In previous reports, CH3NH3PbX3 was always considered as a direct band gap material; however, this is contradictory to its long lifetime. Recently, some researchers have reported that CH3NH3PbI3 has an indirect band gap just below the direct band gap.23,24 In our work, for most of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals (except for x = 0.02, 0.1, 0.24), there are two very close absorption peaks (α and β) near the band edge. These two peaks are considered to be caused by direct absorption (α) and indirect absorption (β), respectively. This means that direct and indirect transitions coexisted in the CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals are shown in Fig. 5d. The spectra show that the PL peaks of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx crystals are disordered and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals show more than one emission peaks. By comparing the absorption and PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals (Fig. 6), it is seen that for CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 1.64, 2.39, 2.81, 2.9) (Fig. 6f–i), the band edges could be divided into two regions by the turning points located at about 677 nm, 623 nm, 602 nm, and 592 nm, respectively, and the emission peaks are located at the end of the second band edge with higher wavelengths. This phenomenon indicates they might be indirect-bandgap materials.20
 Fig. 6  Comparisons between the absorbance and PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (a–i) and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly (j–p) crystals (Ab. = absorption, Em. = emission, Em(ex.) = exciton emission). 
Although the absorption coefficients of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly are considered to be contributed by both direct and indirect absorption, their emission nature includes three types, namely, direct emission, indirect emission and direct–indirect coexisting emission. For the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal (Fig. 6a), the PL emission peak belongs to the absorption peak α; thus it is considered as a direct recombination. For the CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals (y = 2, 2.52, 2.69) (Fig. 6m–o), the two nearby absorption peaks existing in the PL emission spectra represent the direct and indirect recombination, respectively. For the CH3NH3PbI2.27Br0.73 and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly (y = 0.92, 1.33) crystals (Fig. 6e, k, l), the PL emission peaks belong to the absorption peak β; as a result, they are considered as an indirect recombination. Finally, for the CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly (y = 2, 2.52, 2.69, 3) crystals, they have another emission peak away from the band edge; thus these peaks are considered as exciton luminescence. Because their indirect absorption peaks are remarkably sharp, the increased absorption coefficient might be caused by the exciton effect.
From the above analysis, the schematic band diagram for CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 0.73) and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals was devised and is shown in Fig. 7a. There exists a very close indirect-bandgap CBM (conduction band minimum) just below the CBD (direct conduction band), and the energy difference between the CBM and CBD is very small. Thus, direct-absorption (α) from the VBM (valence band maximum) to the CBD and indirect-absorption (β) from the VBM to the CBM would coexist, and the three emission forms include direct-emission (from CBD to VBM), indirect-emission (from CBM to VBM) and direct–indirect coexisting emission. For the mixed-halide CH3NH3PbX3, the energy bands should be more complex, and it is probable that multi-band minima exist in the conduction band. According to the bandgap diagram shown in Fig. 7a, Fig. 7b was generated and is provided here to show the bandgap diagram of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 1.64, 2.39, 2.81, 2.9) crystals. We speculate that there is another indirect-bandgap away from the CBD; thus another indirect-absorption and only one emission way from the CBM to the VBM by emission phonons were observed. The absorption and PL emission information of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals are summarized in Table 3.

Thermal behavior
TGA (thermal gravimetric analysis) and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) curves of the CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 0.24, 1.64, 2.81) and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly (y = 0.92, 2, 2.69) crystals are shown in Fig. 8. In previous reports, the weight loss process of CH3NH3PbX3 can be divided into two parts: first it loses CH3NH3X, and then it loses PbX2.20,25,26 For the CH3NH3PbI2.76Br0.24 crystal, its TGA curve is similar to that of CH3NH3PbI3. Combined with DSC, CH3NH3PbI2.76Br0.24 crystals first lose 16% of the mass of HI at 304 °C, and then lose 8% of HBr at 359 °C and finally lose 3% of CH3NH2 at 398 °C. For the CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 1.64, 2.81) crystals, the decomposition occurs at 254 °C and 249 °C, losing 18% and 20% of CH3NH3X (X = I or Br), respectively. Compared with CH3NH3PbI2.76Br0.24, the decomposition temperature of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 1.64, 2.81) is reduced by about 50 °C. For the CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly (y = 0.92, 2, 2.69) crystals, the endothermic peaks at 264 °C, 243 °C and 241 °C should be due to the mass loss of CH3NH3X, respectively. The exothermic peaks at 380 °C, 431 °C and 475 °C were observed between the two weight-loss processes, which should be due to the melting peak of ‘lead halide’, and with the increase of the Cl content, the melting point of ‘lead halide’ increased.

Conclusions
In conclusion, systematic doping of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly single crystals were successfully achieved by the ITC method using mixed solvents. Due to the differences in the radii of halogen ions, their lattice parameters exhibit a linear change with increasing x(y) values, and cubic to tetragonal structure transformation was observed for CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx crystals when the iodine content reaches a certain level. The optical absorption of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals almost covers the entire visible region. By comparing the absorption and PL spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals, the CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 1.64, 2.39, 2.81, 2.9) crystals were considered as indirect band gap materials. For most of the CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals, there are two absorption peaks near their band edges. These two peaks were considered as direct and indirect absorption peaks, respectively, indicating an indirect bandgap exists just below the direct bandgap, and their absorption coefficients are contributed by both direct and indirect transitions. The radiative recombination is different for different crystals; CH3NH3PbI3 is reported to show direct emission, CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly (y = 2, 2.52, 2.69) is confirmed to exhibit both direct and indirect emission mechanisms, and CH3NH3PbI2.27Br0.73 and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly (y = 0.92, 1.33) are considered to show indirect emission. Finally, TG/DSC measurements show the decomposition mechanism of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and CH3NH3PbBr3−yCly crystals, and the results show that the decomposition temperatures decrease with the increase of x(y) values. Our studies on mixed halogen perovskite single crystals would be very useful to reveal the inherent properties of perovskite materials.
