    , Accepted 26th June 2012First published on 4th July 2012AbstractA fast and facile process for the preparation of perovskite NaTaO3 nanocrystals with Ta2O5 and NaOH as starting materials by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal (MHT) technique is reported. By pretreating the Ta2O5 powder by ball milling, pure-phase NaTaO3 can be synthesized under quite mild conditions through the formation of an intermediate pyrochlore Na2Ta2O6 phase, while much longer times are required in a conventional hydrothermal (CHT) process. After loading with NiO co-catalyst, the NaTaO3 nanocrystals prepared by the MHT method showed photocatalytic activity for overall water splitting more than two times greater than those prepared under CHT conditions.
Introduction
In recent years, the synthesis of semiconductor nanoparticles has attracted much attention from researchers due to their promising applications in the conversion of solar energy to hydrogen.1 Semiconductor materials with the perovskite structure have been found to show reasonable activities for splitting water into H2 and O2 in a stoichiometric ratio under irradiation, such as tantalate,2,3 niobate,4 and titanate (including titanium oxide).5 Among them, perovskite-type sodium tantalate (NaTaO3) demonstrated the highest quantum efficiency after loading with a NiO co-catalyst.6 Research into its synthesis route,7–15 surface and bulk modification,16–18 spectral investigation,19,20 and theoretical calculations21–23 are well developed, and it is now recognized as a model material with UV-light response.
The photocatalytic activities of semiconductor nanoparticles are known to be critically influenced by their crystallinity and surface area, because the former reduces the number of electron–hole recombination centers and the latter provides more surface active sites for photocatalytic reactions. To prepare NaTaO3 with high crystallinity and/or high surface area, different synthesis methods have been established, such as conventional solid state reactions,2,3,6,7 sol–gel routes,13,14 alkalide reduction,12etc. However, these techniques usually require either high temperature processing or special facilities with tedious experimental procedures. Recently, the facile conventional hydrothermal (CHT) method has been developed for the preparation of NaTaO3 nanoparticles under mild conditions.8–10 Without additional templates and surfactants, pure perovskite NaTaO3 nanoparticles with an average size of 200 nm can generally be obtained by this method in a small capacity (≤50 ml) autoclave.8–10 With the aid of mesoporous carbon templates, smaller NaTaO3 nanoparticles, 20–50 nm in size, have been successfully synthesized under hydrothermal conditions.11 However, in these cases, a long reaction time, from 12 h to 3 days, is required to obtain the pure crystalline NaTaO3 phase without regard to other necessary operational steps. A fast and facile synthesis method under moderate conditions is strongly desirable for the preparation of NaTaO3, as well as enhanced photocatalytic activity.
Microwave heating is well known to be very rapid and homogeneous due to the direct heating of liquid, so that it can not only induce homogeneous nucleation but also greatly enhance reaction rates by 1–2 orders of magnitude.24–26 Combining this heating mode with a simple hydrothermal method, the microwave-assisted hydrothermal (MHT) method is expected to be a fast and facile synthesis route. Some semiconductor powders, such as WO3,27 N-doped TiO2,28 BiFeO3,29 and BaTiO330 have been prepared by the MHT method. However, such a MHT technique has not been used to prepare NaTaO3 semiconductor materials. In this paper, we report a fast and facile synthesis route for the pure perovskite NaTaO3 by the MHT technique. The effect of reaction temperature, reaction time, alkali concentration, and pretreatment of Ta2O5 on the formation of the sodium tantalate phase were systematically studied under MHT conditions. The mechanism for the fast growth of pure NaTaO3 nanocrystals is proposed according to the phase evolution during the reactions. The nanocubic morphology and the photoabsorbance properties were revealed for the as-prepared samples. After loading with NiO co-catalyst, the photocatalytic performance of the obtained NaTaO3 nanocubes for overall water splitting under UV irradiation was tested.
Experimental
Preparation
Ta2O5 (≥99.99%) bought from Amresco, USA and NaOH (AR) were employed as the starting materials. Firstly, 0.54 g (1.2 mmol) of Ta2O5 was added to 75 ml of 0.2–6.0 M NaOH solution to form a mixed suspension by magnetically stirring at room temperature. The resultant dispersion was then transferred to a 100 ml Teflon vessel, model XP-1500 (CEM Corp.), in a MARS-5 microwave digestion system operated at 2.45 GHz (EM Corp.), with a maximum power output of 1600 W. The reaction mixture was heated to 100–220 °C in 20 min and maintained at the designated temperature for 5 min to 6 h. After the reaction, the autoclave was allowed to cool to room temperature. Then the solid product was washed with deionized water several times by centrifugation, and finally dried in air overnight at 60 °C. For comparison, the dispersion was also transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave with the same capacity and then put into an oven to carry out the conventional hydrothermal reaction at the same temperature for 3–24 h. The products were washed and collected by the same procedure. Pretreatment of the Ta2O5 raw material by ball milling was carried out on a planet type grinding mill machine (QM-3SP04, Nanjing University Co.) with agate beads for 4–12 h.
Characterization
All samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2500PC, Japan) using graphite-filtered Cu Kα (λ = 0.154 nm) radiation, and the applied current and voltage were 100 mA and 40 kV, respectively. The morphology and particle size were revealed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta200F, the Netherlands) operated at 20 KV, a transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai Spirit, the Netherlands) and a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, FEI Tecnai F30, the Netherlands) operated at 120 KV and 300 KV, respectively. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Jasco V-550, Japan) between 200 and 900 nm with a scan rate of 200 nm min−1. The specific areas of the powders were determined by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 specific area and porosity analyzer using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.
Photocatalytic tests for overall water splitting
Photocatalytic reactions were carried out in a gas-closed circulation system at 15–18 °C maintained by a flow of cooling water. The photocatalyst powder (0.3 g) was dispersed in a reactant solution (500 ml) by a magnetic stirrer in an inner irradiation cell made of quartz. Doubly distilled water was employed as the reactant solution for splitting water into H2 and O2. The light source was a 450 W high-pressure mercury lamp (Ushio; UM453B-A). The amounts of H2 and O2 evolved were determined using gas chromatography (Shimadzu; GC-8A, MS-5A column, TCD, Ar carrier).
Results and discussion
In the hydrothermal synthesis of perovskite NaTaO3, the reaction temperature, the concentration of the alkaline solution and the reaction time are generally the three most important parameters affecting the crystal structure and composition.8–11Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of MHT samples prepared at different reaction temperatures. For the sample prepared at 100 °C, all the diffraction peaks are attributed to the raw material Ta2O5 (according to the reported data in the JCPDS card #25-0922), suggesting that no reaction occurred under those conditions. When the reaction temperature was increased to 120 °C, peaks due to an orthorhombic perovskite phase of NaTaO3 (JCPDS card #25-0863) appeared, and their diffraction intensities strengthened with the increase of reaction temperature. However, the characteristic diffraction peaks for the raw material Ta2O5, as shown in Fig. 1, are also observed for all these samples, despite the gradual decrease in the relative intensity of the peaks with the increase of hydrothermal temperature. These results indicate that the reaction between Ta2O5 and NaOH can be rapidly triggered to produce crystalline perovskite NaTaO3 under MHT conditions, but residual Ta2O5 is still detected in the final products at these reaction temperatures, suggesting that the reaction between Ta2O5 and NaOH was not complete. It should be noted that the molar ratios of NaOH to Ta2O5 were over 170 for all the cases presented in this work. Namely, NaOH is present in excess, and all the Ta2O5 reagent should be able to react completely according to the stoichiometric equation as follows:Ta2O5 + 2NaOH = 2NaTaO3 + H2O

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the samples prepared at 160 °C for 3 h with different concentrations of NaOH. It can be clearly seen that crystalline NaTaO3 was formed in 0.5– 6.0 M NaOH solutions. But the Ta2O5 raw material still remained in all the obtained samples, regardless of the high NaOH solution concentration. After prolonging the reaction time to 6 h, as shown from curve (a) in Fig. S1,† the diffraction peaks of the raw material (Ta2O5) were still observed. It is also noticed that in the same case under CHT conditions, the conversion of Ta2O5 was still incomplete, even though the reaction time was increased to 12, 18, and 24 h, as demonstrated by XRD patterns (b)–(d) in Fig. S1.† These results are different from previous data reported on the synthesis of NaTaO3 under similar conditions by the CHT method, in which the raw material of Ta2O5 generally converts into NaTaO3 completely after 12–24 h of reaction.8–10 The reason could be ascribed to the different volumes of reaction solution used, which was 20–40 ml in previous reports, while volumes as large as 75 ml were used in the present work.

However, to our surprise, the pure perovskite NaTaO3 phase could be obtained even under mild conditions if the Ta2O5 was ball milled for several hours before the MHT reactions. As can be seen in Fig. 3, using 6-hour-milled Ta2O5 as the raw material, only a small amount of an impurity phase of pyrochlore Na2Ta2O6 (JCPDS card #70-1155) was observed mixed with the final perovskite NaTaO3 when the reaction was performed at 160 °C in 1.75 M NaOH solution for 1 h (curve a). This impurity phase vanished quickly and a single NaTaO3 phase was formed when the reaction time was prolonged to 2 or 3 h (curves b and c). Under milder conditions, such as at 120 °C in 1.0 M NaOH solution for 3 h, the pure perovskite NaTaO3 could also be obtained when the Ta2O5 was ball milled for a longer duration of 12 h (curve d). For comparison purposes, the pretreated Ta2O5 was employed in the CHT reactions. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. S2† demonstrate that pure NaTaO3 crystals could be synthesized after a long reaction time of up to 24 h, despite the presence of an impurity phase of Na2Ta2O6 after shorter reaction times of 3, 6 and 12 h (at 160 °C, 1.75 M NaOH, 6 h milled Ta2O5 as the raw material).
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of the as-prepared samples formed at 160 °C in 1.75 M NaOH solution with 6 hour milled Ta2O5 as the starting material for (a) 1 h, (b) 2 h, and (c) 3 h, and (d) the sample formed at 120 °C in 1.0 M NaOH solution for 3 h with 12 h milled Ta2O5 as starting material. 
More experimental results about the phase components of the powder products prepared with Ta2O5 pretreated by ball milling for 0–12 h, as a function of NaOH concentration and reaction time at two typical reaction temperatures of 120 and 160 °C, are shown in Fig. 4. When no pretreatment was applied to the tantalum pentoxide raw material, all the products contained an impurity phase of Ta2O5, regardless of the MHT conditions, as already indicated in Fig. 1 and 2 and Fig. S1.† After pretreating the tantalum pentoxide for 4 h, there was no Ta2O5 remaining, but a new phase of pyrochlore Na2Ta2O6 appeared together with the perovskite NaTaO3 when the reaction was performed at a comparatively high temperature of 160 °C in a more concentrated alkaline solution of 1.75 M. Extending the pretreatment time of Ta2O5 to 6 h, a single phase of perovskite NaTaO3 was obtained at 160 °C, 1.0 M NaOH and at 120 °C, 1.75 M NaOH after 3 h, respectively. By increasing the alkali concentration to 1.75 M at 160 °C in this case, the required reaction time can be shortened to 2 h (curve b in Fig. 3). Conversely, no pure NaTaO3 phase but a mixture with the pyrochlore phase was formed at the low alkaline concentration of 0.5 M at 160 °C (curve d in Fig. S3†). Meanwhile, it is noticed that the metastable pyrochlore did not form at 120 °C, although a long pretreatment period of 6–10 h was performed on the raw material. Instead, a mixture of Ta2O5 and NaTaO3 was produced, similar to those cases with untreated Ta2O5 as starting material. However, it is indeed the case that the pure NaTaO3 nanocrystals could be synthesized under milder reaction conditions if the Ta2O5 powders were ball milled in advance for a longer duration. For example, using 12 h milled Ta2O5 as the raw material, a single NaTaO3 phase can be obtained at 120 °C, 1.0 M NaOH for 3 h as mentioned above, and a mixture containing NaTaO3, Na2Ta2O6 and Ta2O5 was detected after only 5 min of reaction at 160 °C, 1.0 M NaOH (curve c in Fig. S3†). However, the pyrochlore phase did not convert into NaTaO3 at low concentrations of NaOH solution, such as at 0.2 M. In other words, this intermediate phase remained stable in this case (curve b in Fig. S3†). From these results, it is summarized that: (1) the phase components of the final products are strongly dependent on the pretreatment of Ta2O5 and the hydrothermal conditions; (2) the formation of an intermediate phase of pyrochlore Na2Ta2O6 is a key step in the formation of a pure NaTaO3 phase in the present cases, and the phase evolution from the raw material of Ta2O5 towards the single phase perovskite NaTaO3 should follow the path of Ta2O5 → Ta2O5 + Na2Ta2O6 → Ta2O5 + Na2Ta2O6 + NaTaO3 → Na2Ta2O6 + NaTaO3 → NaTaO3, as shown in Fig. S3;† (3) pretreating Ta2O5 by ball milling for MHT reactions effectively helps the complete conversion of Ta2O5 by forming an intermediate phase of Na2Ta2O6.

Thus, two reaction paths can be concluded from the above results: one is the direct conversion of Ta2O5 to NaTaO3, and the other is an indirect route of Ta2O5 → Na2Ta2O6 → NaTaO3. It was recorded in the JCPDS cards that the lattice parameters and cell density for the cubic pyrochlore Na2Ta2O6 phase and the orthorhombic perovskite NaTaO3 phase are 10.442 Å × 10.442 Å × 10.442 Å and 5.92 g cm−3, and 5.513 Å × 7.75 Å × 5.494 Å and 7.129 g cm−3, respectively. As such, the pyrochlore crystal cells should have a bigger volume and a looser structure than those of the perovskite, implying a metastable intermediate phase due to structural instability. In a previous report, a pure Na2Ta2O6 phase was synthesized by a CHT method at a very low reaction temperature of 110 °C, and then converted into the perovskite NaTaO3 by post-calcination at temperatures above 1073 K.31 The crystalline Na2Ta2O6 was confirmed to be an intermediate phase which could grow and remain quite stable in 1 M NaOH solution, though it could similarly transform into the perovskite phase in 5 M NaOH solution by a hydrothermal–electrochemical process.15 In our case, the pyrochlore phase can form at as low a concentrations of NaOH solution as 0.2 M, with milled Ta2O5 as the precursor, and converts into the perovskite compound under comparatively harsh conditions, as indicated above. Since there are no additional templates and catalysts in the reaction between Ta2O5 and NaOH in the present cases, the thermodynamic energy barrier heights for the phase conversions are estimated to be in the following order: Ta2O5 → Na2Ta2O6 < NaTaO3 → Na2Ta2O6 < Ta2O5 → NaTaO3, as proposed in Fig. 5. A reaction pathway with a lower thermodynamic energy barrier, preferentially taken by the ball milled Ta2O5 raw material under hydrothermal conditions, may account for the successful synthesis of pure perovskite NaTaO3.

To further understand the effect of ball milling on the selectivity of the reaction route, we compared the phases, morphologies and BET surface areas of Ta2O5 before and after ball milling. XRD analysis revealed no structural change after ball milling, but the SEM images of the Ta2O5 powder that was ball milled for 0, 6, 8 and 12 h, shown in Fig. 6, indicate that the sizes of particles obviously become smaller and smaller with the increase of milling time, although all of them show a featureless morphology. The BET measurements suggested that the surface areas of Ta2O5 as-received and ball milled for 6, 8, 10, and 12 h are 2.5, 5.0, 8.6, 8.8, 10.5 m2 g−1, respectively, i.e., increased by about 2–5 times after treating for 6–12 h. Consequently, the mechanical grinding results in the refining of the Ta2O5 particles without phase transition. It is already known that the reaction between Ta2O5 and NaOH follows the dissolution–recrystallization mechanism under hydrothermal conditions.10,15 The formation of the pyrochlore Na2Ta2O6 crystal nucleus undoubtedly requires more active tantalum sources to react with the surrounding Na+ ions, compared with the nucleation of perovskite NaTaO3. The treated Ta2O5 particles with smaller size and higher energetic areas are believed to dissolve more quickly in alkaline solutions at certain hydrothermal temperatures, which can provide sufficient tantalum sources to produce the metastable Na2Ta2O6 phase preferentially by thermodynamics. In comparison, the limited number of tantalum ions released by the relatively slow dissolution of the large as-received Ta2O5 particles forces the reaction to span a higher thermodynamic energy barrier to generate the NaTaO3 nucleus, following the direct conversion pathway. The conversion of Ta2O5 by this reaction pathway is difficult to complete in present cases. So, it is thought that the treatment of Ta2O5 by ball milling mainly promotes the dissolution process, and this dissolution speed decides which reaction path is taken.

Fig. 7 shows the SEM images of a representative NaTaO3 sample prepared by the CHT method(Fig. 7a), and two typical NaTaO3 samples prepared by MHT techniques (Fig. 7b and c). The cubic morphology can be clearly seen for these samples, which is same as that of the perovskite NaTaO3 particles synthesized without additional templates in previous reports.6–10,13,14 In other words, this cubic appearance is quite stable and is generally independent of preparation methods. It is worth noting that the grain sizes of the as-prepared NaTaO3 nanoparticles formed at 160 °C in 1.75 M NaOH solution for 3 h with Ta2O5 pretreated for 6 h (this sample is designated as NT-160 for short) by the MHT method are smaller and more homogeneous than those prepared in 24 h under CHT conditions, as shown in Fig. 7a and b. This is due to the fact that microwave heating can transfer heat to the substance uniformly, leading to a more homogeneous nucleation and thus induce a more uniform size of the as-prepared sample particles (about 100 nm on average for sample NT-160).24 The grain sizes became smaller when the sample was prepared at 120 °C in 1.0 M NaOH solution for 3 h with Ta2O5 pretreated for 12 h under MHT conditions (this sample is designated as NT-120 for short). Besides the regular cubic particles, there are some smaller irregular grains coexisting in the sample, which should be ascribed to tiny agglomerated Ta2O5 particles after ball milling for a long time (see the corresponding SEM images of the pretreated Ta2O5 in Fig. 6). Fig. 8a and c demonstrate the TEM images of samples NT-160 and NT-120, respectively. The morphology revealed for these two samples agrees well with the observation of the SEM results. A single cubic NaTaO3 crystal of NT-160 was picked out for a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) experiment, and the spot pattern is shown in the left upper inset in Fig. 8b, confirming the crystallinity of the as-prepared NT-160 nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the lattice fringes are also clearly discernible, as indicated by the HRTEM image shown in the right lower inset of Fig. 8b. In contrast, Fig. 8d shows the HRTEM image of sample NT-120. The much less distinct lattice fringes shown in this picture imply the poorer crystallinity of sample NT-120. However, the cubic morphology of the products is very stable as reported in previous works, regardless of the changing of the reaction conditions.9–12 The band gap of the as-prepared samples was estimated to be 4.0 eV from the onset of the absorption (the representative diffuse reflectance spectroscopy as shown in Fig. S4†), which confirms the formation of perovskite NaTaO3.2–6,13,14

To compare the photocatalytic performances of the pure NaTaO3 phases prepared under MHT and CHT conditions, the typical powder samples obtained in 1.75 M NaOH at 160 °C for 3 h by MHT technique and 24 h by CHT method were evaluated as photocatalysts for overall water splitting after loading with a NiO co-catalyst. The optimum amount of NiO has been reported to vary in the range of 0.2–1.0 wt% which is dependent on the varied preparation methods.2–6,11,14 For NaTaO3 particles prepared by the MHT method, the optimum amount of loaded NiO was investigated by measuring the average rates of H2 and O2 liberation by overall water splitting under UV irradiation (λ > 200 nm) in 4 h, as illustrated in Fig. 9. The optimum amounts of NiO for the NaTaO3 crystals synthesized under MHT and CHT conditions were both found to be 0.4 wt% in our cases. The time courses of H2 and O2 evolution under UV irradiation are recorded in Fig. 10a and b. Stable photocatalytic evolution of H2 and O2 was observed at the stoichiometric ratio during the measurements. The photocatalytic activity of the NaTaO3 nanoparticles prepared under MHT conditions was more than two times greater than that of the nanoparticles prepared under CHT conditions. It is noticed that the measured BET surface areas of these two samples are 6.4 and 4.2 m2 g−1, respectively, suggesting that the surface area increased by 1.5 times when the NaTaO3 was obtained by the MHT method in a shorter reaction time. So, it is considered that this high activity can be attributed to the larger surface area, as well as the higher crystallinity of samples obtained under MHT conditions. Whereas for the samples prepared under CHT conditions, the repetitious crystallization during the long reaction period generally induces the grains to grow to larger sizes, resulting in a loss of surface area of the final product. Meanwhile, the persistent soaking in a strong alkaline solution under hydrothermal conditions is likely to greatly increase the number of surface defects of the crystals, which is unfavorable to the photocatalytic activity. Similar results on the photocatalytic performance were also found for the 0.4 wt% NiO loaded NaTaO3 particles that were prepared in 1.0 M NaOH solution at 120 °C with 12 h milled Ta2O5 as the precursor, as indicated in Fig. 10c and d; the amount of gases produced using the photocatalyst synthesized via the MHT technique is about two times that of the photocatalyst produced by the CHT method. Therefore, it can be concluded that the fast preparation by the MHT method is also beneficial to the photocatalytic activity. Detailed investigation is now underway.

Conclusions
Sodium tantalate nanocrystals can be prepared by a MHT technique in a fast and facile way. Pretreatment of the raw material of Ta2O5 by ball milling is a crucial step in obtaining a pure perovskite NaTaO3 phase. Combining these two techniques, the NaTaO3 nanocrystals can be synthesized in a rather short reaction time (less than 3 h) under mild conditions, while generally up to 24 h is required in a CHT process. By monitoring the phase evolution during the reaction process, crystal growth mechanisms were proposed. An indirect synthesis route of Ta2O5 → Na2Ta2O6 → NaTaO3 is suggested to occur when using the ball milled Ta2O5 as the starting material, while a direct conversion from Ta2O5 to NaTaO3 is put forward for the reactions starting from the as-received Ta2O5. The indirect path should be a process with a lower thermodynamic energy barrier in comparison with the direct one, so that it can drive a complete reaction to produce the pure perovskite NaTaO3 under milder conditions. The NaTaO3 photocatalysts obtained by the MHT method show quite a high activity in overall water splitting under UV irradiation, due to the good crystallinity and large surface area achieved in a short reaction time. This fast and facile synthesis method is promising for the fabrication of nanostructures of various semiconductor functional materials with advanced properties.
