    , Accepted 27th September 2016First published on 27th September 2016AbstractGe-doped CZTSSe thin films were obtained by covering a thin Ge layer on CZTS precursors, followed by a selenization process. The effect of the Ge layer thickness on the morphologies and structural properties of Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films were studied. It was found that Ge doping could promote grain growth to form a compact thin film. The lattice shrank in the top-half of the film due to the smaller atomic radius of Ge, leading to the formation of tensile stress. According to thermodynamic analysis, Sn was easier to be selenized than Ge. Thus, Ge preferred to remain on the surface and increased the surface roughness when the Ge layer was thin. CZTSe was easier to form than Ge-doped CZTSe, which caused difficulty in Ge doping. These results offered a theoretical and experimental guide for preparing Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films for the potential applications in low-cost solar cells. With a 10 nm Ge layer on the top of the precursor, the conversion efficiency of the solar cell improved to 5.38% with an open-circuit voltage of 403 mV, a short-circuit current density of 28.51 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 46.83% after Ge doping.
1. Introduction
Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 (CZTSSe) thin film solar cells, derived from commercially available Cu(In,Ga)(SxSe1−x)2 (CIGS) devices, were considered as a potential replacement of the latter due to its earth abundant elements and optimal band gap.1 However, the highest conversion efficiency reported for CZTSSe solar cells have been obtained with 12.7%,2 which is far from the efficiency of CIGS devices being over 20%.3 One factor for this efficiency gap should be the large open circuit voltage (VOC) deficit (defined by Eg/q − VOC, where q was the electronic charge) of the CZTSSe solar cells.4 This deficit was caused mainly by charge pair recombination, which happened in CZTSSe thin films and the interface between CZTSSe absorber and CdS buffer layer.5 The former type of recombination could be suppressed by improving the crystallinity and microstructure of the absorber,6 whereas the recombination at the interface is related to the band alignment.7 Thus far, there are a few arguments about the type and value of the conduction band offset of CZTSSe/CdS,7–9 but there is no doubt that it is not the favorable spike-like conduction band offset with a value of 0–0.4 eV. Band gap tuning of CZTSSe by substituting atoms in the same group is an effective way to adjust the band alignment of CZTSSe/CdS. It was reported that the substitution of Sn with Ge atoms in CZTSSe could improve the performance of CZTSSe solar cells as it could prevent Sn from forming a +II oxidation state, which was predicted to form deep recombination centers in CZTSSe thin films.10 It could also enlarge the band gap of CZTSSe thin films, which might help optimize the band alignment of CZTSSe/CdS.
Since Ford et al. synthesized Cu2Zn(SnxGe1−x)(SxSe1−x)4 (CZTGeSSe) solar cells by an ink method,11 the chemical synthesis method became a dominant way to prepare CZTGeSSe nanocrystals and thin films in the early stages.12–15 Physical vapor deposition (PVD) was recently reported to be used in the CZTGeSSe device fabrication process.16,17 Usually, a 30–40% Ge substitution amount was needed to achieve efficiency improvement in CZTSSe solar cells prepared by a chemical method, whereas even a small amount of Ge doping quantity was proved to have great enhancement in the performance of CZTSSe devices fabricated by sputtering methods.17,18 Owing to the low crustal abundance of Ge,19 a PVD method is more promising for the applications of CZTSSe solar cells in future. There is a need for more systematic studies on exploring the film growth mechanism or structural properties of a Ge-doped CZTSSe solar cell device prepared via the PVD method.
In this study, we used a magnetron sputtering method to prepare Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films. Ge doping into CZTSSe thin films was realized by covering a thin Ge layer on a Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) precursor, followed by a selenization process. The morphologies and structural properties of Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films with different Ge layer thicknesses were investigated. The formation mechanism was established with the help of thermodynamic analysis. Solar cells were fabricated and analyzed to establish a relationship between the device performance and the properties of thin films.
2. Experimental
CZTS precursors were prepared on Mo-coated glass substrates with a three-layer structure, which were Cu-poor and Zn-rich in bottom and surface, and stoichiometric in the middle, as our previous work reported.20 A thin Ge layer under RF 30 W sputtering power with a thickness of 5 nm, 10 nm and 15 nm was deposited upon CZTS precursors. The precursors were then selenized by 20 mg Se pellet at a temperature of 580 °C for 10 min in a tube furnace. The Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films and the related solar cells were named according to Ge layer thickness as sample 5 nm, sample 10 nm and sample 15 nm. One CZTSSe thin film solar cell without a Ge layer covering was also prepared for comparison and called sample 0 nm. The composition of precursors with varying thickness of the Ge layer and as-obtained Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films measured by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Hitachi S4800) are presented in Table S1 in the ESI.† The composition of metal elements in the precursors with different Ge layer thicknesses did not significantly change compared to those in the related Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films. Nearly 2/3 sulfur in the precursors was replaced with selenium after the selenization process.
The Ge-doped CZTSSe solar cells were fabricated in the standard structure of Mo/CZTGeSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO. The CdS buffer layer, 50 nm in thickness, was prepared by chemical bath deposition. ITO and i-ZnO layers of 200 nm and 50 nm thickness were deposited by RF magnetron sputtering. The Ag paste was used to form a contact on the Mo and ITO layer. The CZTSSe solar cells were mechanically scribed and the active area was 0.2 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM1.5G spectrum (Oriel Solar simulator, 91192-1000 W). External quantum efficiency (EQE) was obtained with light wavelength ranging from 300 nm to 1300 nm (Enlitech QE-R).
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultima-IV diffraction-meter with Cu-Kα radiation source) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia, excitation laser wavelength of 532 nm) were used to analyze the structural property of the Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films. The morphologies of the Ge-doped thin films were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S4800). The surface roughness of Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM, FSM FM-Nanoview 6600). XPS measurements were performed in an AXIS-ULTRA DLD system with a monochromatic X-ray source (aluminium Kα line of 1486.6 eV energy and 350 W).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the surface SEM images of Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films. The grain size of the four samples was similar and all reached 2–3 μm. Small pinholes were found in sample 0 nm (Fig. 1(a)) and these pinholes started to shrink and disappeared after the introduction of Ge (Fig. 1(b)–(d)), which indicated that the Ge covering layer may help promote grain growth to form a compact surface. However, several rod-shaped structures formed on the surface of large grains in sample 5 nm, as shown in the inset image of Fig. 1(b). According to Fig. S1(b) in the ESI,† these rod-shaped structures were confirmed to exist only on the surface region of thin film. The number of rod-shaped structures greatly reduced in sample 10 nm and sample 15 nm, of which the latter had slightly more rod-shaped structures on the surface.

In order to confirm the surface roughness of Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films, AFM characterization is shown in Fig. 2. The roughness of the pure CZTSSe thin film was 75 nm. Owing to the growth promoting effect of Ge, the surface roughness of sample 5 nm, sample 10 nm and sample 15 nm all increased. The roughness of sample 5 nm increased to 134 nm. The rod-shaped structures made the large grain surface present a prismatic morphology in Fig. 2(b). As the number of rod-shaped structures reduced, sample 10 nm showed a roughness of 96 nm. While the roughness of sample 15 nm was found to increase again to 138 nm, which may be due to the Ge promoting effect on grain growth. With more Ge-doped into CZTSSe thin film, the grains would grow further, resulting in a rougher surface.

XRD patterns of prepared Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films are shown in Fig. 3(a). The main XRD peak of CZTSSe thin film was observed at 2θ = 27.6°, which was located between the standard (112) peak of pure CZTS phase and Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) phase (JCPDS 26-0575 and JCPDS 52-0868),21 indicating that Se was successfully introduced into the CZTS thin film. GeSe2 phase was found in sample 5 nm, whereas no evident secondary phases' peaks were found in the other three samples. Unlike the shift of peak position in CZTGeSSe thin film,14 the XRD peaks shifted to a lower angle first and then shifted to a higher angle with the increase of Ge layer thickness, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Ge was distributed mainly in the top-half of the thin film when the Ge doping amount was not so large, which was confirmed by the EDS line scan results (Fig. S2 in the ESI†). As the atomic radius of Ge is smaller than Sn,12 the lattice in the top-half of the thin film would shrink, leading to the formation of tensile stress around the surface. Thus, the XRD peaks first shifted to a lower angle. When the Ge doping amount increased to a certain amount, the XRD peaks would shift to a higher angle, which represents the main peak of CZTGeSSe thin film. The reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (112) peak in sample 10 nm and sample 15 nm proved that Ge had a positive effect on promoting grain growth.

In order to further distinguish the phases in Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films, Raman spectroscopy was used, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The ordered dominant CZTSe peak located at around 193 cm−1 and the CZTS peak located at around 324 cm−1 could be seen in all four samples.21 Their shift rule was in agreement with the XRD patterns. The peak located at 215 cm−1 shown in sample 5 nm was attributed to the Ge–Se bond,22 which was also in accordance with the XRD results. As mentioned, the Cu, Zn or Sn related secondary phase had no rod-shaped morphology;23,24 hence, we inferred that the rod-shaped structures on the surface of sample 5 nm were germanium selenide. Moreover, the sensitivity of XRD and Raman test on germanium selenide phase was unknown and the Ge-doped CZTSSe thin films were made up of mainly a CZTSSe phase. Thus, the peaks attributed to germanium selenide phase were only found in sample 5 nm, which was with a much larger number of rod-shaped structures on it than that for sample 10 nm and sample 15 nm.

Thermodynamic analysis could determine the phase stability and reaction priority among particular reactions. Calculations based on the thermodynamic parameters could provide practical judgments of certain reactions to understand the existing phenomena and provide guidance for further adjustment.25 For example, one reaction is presented below: A + B → C(1)in which A and B are reactors and C is the product. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔGr(T)) of this reaction with temperature could be calculated as follows:26 ΔGr(T) ≈ ΔHr(T0) − TΔSr(T0)(2)in which ΔHr(T0) is the standard molar enthalpy change and ΔSr(T0) is the standard molar entropy change of the reaction at 298 K, which are defined as follows:26 ΔHr(T0) = H298,C − (H298,A + H298,B)(3) ΔSr(T0) = S298,C − (S298,A + S298,B)(4)If the reactors and product in the reaction had vapor-phase object, the equilibrium reaction pressure of the vapor P could be determined by25 lg(P) = −ΔGr(T)/2.303RT(5)where R is the ideal gas constant. In our selenization process, the Se pellet was heated to the vapor phase to selenize the precursors. Thus, a temperature-dependent equilibrium Se vapor pressure (PSe) curve could be deduced by combining eqn (2) and (5), which would provide a straightforward evidence of the formation mechanism.
Ge and Sn related selenization reactions and thermodynamic parameters in the temperature range of 600–900 K are listed in Table 1 and deduced temperature-dependent curves of Se2 pressure are plotted in Fig. 5. The equilibrium Se2 pressure over SnSe was far lower than that over GeSe, indicating that Sn was much easier to be selenized than Ge under the same Se2 pressure. The curves for SnSe2 and GeSe2 were close to each other and both were higher than the GeSe curve, indicating that their formation had less priority than the formation of monoselenide. As expected, the curve for CZTSe was above these binary selenide. Thus far, there was no report about the experimental or computer-simulated value of the entropy of Cu2ZnGeSe4 (CZGeSe). Therefore, we could not directly calculate the Gibbs free energy change of the CZGeSe forming reaction. According to Nakamura's work, the formation enthalpy at 0 K and the enthalpy change of CZGeSe were greater than that of CZTSe.27 Considering that the doping amount of Ge is small, we assumed the entropy of CZTSe and Ge-doped CZTSe were the same in our experiment. Thus, we could infer that CZTSe was easier to form than Ge-doped CZTSe.

The formation of CZTSSe grains was from the reaction of related metal selenide phases. The metal element could not react with other selenide to form CZTSSe.28 The introduction of Se vapor started from the surface and it worked as the driving force.29 For sample 5 nm, the deposited Ge layer thickness was probably too thin to form a continuous film (see Fig. S3 in the ESI† for more details). Most of the Se vapor may first react with uncovered CZTS precursor to replace sulfur in the precursor and form CZTSSe grains. Thus, a relatively low Se vapor pressure was around the surface. The Ge islands would be selenized slowly to a selenide phase and barely doped into the CZTSSe thin film, resulting in a large amount of germanium selenide precipitated on the surface after the selenization process. For samples 10 nm and 15 nm, the thickness of the Ge layer was adequate to form a continuous film, as shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† Therefore, Se vapor would first selenize Ge to a germanium selenide phase. CZTSSe and CZGeSSe would then be formed by the deeper penetrated Se vapor. However, excess Ge and Sn amount beyond stoichiometry, particularly the former, would still be precipitated on the surface in the selenide phase as secondary phases were formed easily during selenization if the ratio deviated from stoichiometry.28 This was the reason for more rod-shape structures appearing on sample 15 nm than those in sample 10 nm.
To confirm the Ge position in the CZTSSe lattice, the XPS spectrum of sample 10 nm was measured, and plotted in Fig. 6. All spectral features were attributed to core-levels or Auger lines of constituent elements of the Ge-doped CZTSSe thin film. Some low intensity lines or the lines associated with carbon or oxygen atoms were not observed in Fig. 6(a) as the sample was exposed in ambient condition before the test. The binding energies of Cu 2p, Zn 2p, Sn 3d, S 2p and Se 3d were consistent with the values reported in CZTSSe compound.30 The Ge 2p3/2 core-level spectrum was in agreement with that in the CZGeSe4 compound,31 revealing that Ge had been doped successfully into CZTSSe and occupied the Sn position in the lattice as both CZGeSe4 and CZTSSe had a kesterite-type structure. The composition of sample 10 nm deduced from the XPS spectrum is shown in Table 2. The ratio of Ge/(Ge + Sn) was 0.13 and the total amount of Ge and Sn was slightly more that that of Zn. This composition was close to that measured by EDS in Table S1 (ESI†), indicating that the total amount of Ge and Sn was indeed beyond stoichiometry when the Ge layer was 10 nm. Thus there were rod-shape structures existing on the surface of sample 10 nm and the situation was worse in sample 15 nm.

Current density–voltage (J–V) curves of Ge-doped CZTSSe solar cells are shown in Fig. 7(a) and their photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 3. As a result of the promoting effect of Ge layer on grain growth, the pinholes disappeared after Ge doping. The shunting paths weakened, leading to an enhancement of the short-circuit current density in the solar cells with Ge doping. In addition, EQE spectra of Ge-doped CZTSSe solar cells in Fig. 7(b) showed an enhancement in the visible and near infrared region after Ge doping. These results indicate that Ge had a positive effect on enhancing the collection of charge carriers generated deeply in the CZTSSe thin films.17 In other words, Ge may help decrease the bulk recombination in the absorber. Under the synergistic effect of shunting paths' fixing and bulk recombination decreasing, the open-circuit voltage of sample 10 nm and sample 15 nm increased by 15–18 mV and sample 10 nm reached an efficiency of 5.38%. The interface between CZTSSe and CdS played an important role in the device performance. The rough surface of the CZTSSe thin film would cause serious recombination on the interface.32 A large number of the rod-shaped structures on sample 5 nm impaired the deposition environment of the CdS buffer, which caused a decrease in the fill factor and open-circuit voltage. According to the AFM result, sample 15 nm also showed a rougher surface than that of sample 10 nm and the fill factor of sample 15 nm decreased to 35.00%. The holes between the Mo layer and the absorber, presented in Fig. S1(b) in the ESI,† may be another reason for the low fill factor of sample 5 nm. The performance of Ge-doped devices may be enhanced further by eliminating the secondary phases on the surface by chemical etching.

4. Conclusion
Ge-Doped CZTSSe thin film solar cells were prepared with an enhancement of 25.4% in conversion efficiency because the introduction of Ge helped reduce the pinholes and bulk recombination of the absorber film. Sn substitution by Ge was confirmed by XPS and the Ge/(Ge + Sn) ratio was 0.13 in the champion device. The Ge was distributed mainly in the top-half of the CZTSSe thin film, leading to the formation of tensile stress as the smaller Ge atom would cause lattice shrinkage. Thermodynamic analysis proved that SnSe was easier to form than GeSe during the selenization process. Thus germanium selenide would remain on the surface and make the surface rough when the Ge layer is too thin to form a continuous film. Ge doping was found not to be realized easily as the formation of CZTSe had priority over the formation of Ge-doped CZTSe. Therefore, the excess amount of Ge beyond stoichiometry would form secondary phases and precipitate on the film surface.
