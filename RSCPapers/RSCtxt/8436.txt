    , Accepted 5th January 2020First published on 6th January 2020AbstractFirst-principles calculations based on density functional theory were carried out to explore the geometric structure, light absorption, charge separation, over-potential and stability of Bi2O4 (101)/BiVO4 (010) heterojunction. The results show that the formed heterojunction can improve visible light utilization and promote transfer of photo-generated holes from BiVO4 to Bi2O4. Furthermore, the Bi5+ site in the Bi2O4(101) surface is energetically more favorable as the photoanode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than the Bi3+ sites in Bi2O4(101) and BiVO4(010). At the same time, it is also found that the Bi5+ in Bi2O4(101) are more stable than the Bi3+ due to the lower surface energy and stronger bond energy with neighbors. Therefore, forming the Bi2O4/BiVO4 heterojunction can effectively improve the activity and stability of BiVO4 for water splitting reactions.
1. Introduction
Environmental pollution and energy crises have become central issues for the sustainable development of human society. In recent years, a great amount of research has been focused on environmentally friendly and sustainable energy generation. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has attracted worldwide attention because it can produce hydrogen directly from water using solar power and does not create environmental pollution.1–3 PEC water splitting is a renewable pathway to store energy from sunlight in the form of hydrogen. The process utilizes a semiconductor photoelectrode immersed in an electrolyte to absorb sunlight, separate electrons and holes, and promote the water oxidation and reduction reactions on the separated surfaces.4 A great challenge lies in the fact that there has been a lack of suitable anode materials for low-cost and sustainable PEC water splitting. Candidate materials including BiVO4, TiO2, α-Fe2O3 and so forth5,6 have been explored by many researchers in recent years. Among them, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has emerged as a promising n-type photoanode material owning to its intrinsic advantages of having a small band gap energy (ca. 2.4 eV), favorable band-edge positions, and low onset potential.7–10 However, the efficiency remains relatively low because the water oxidation efficiency is limited by multiple electron–hole recombination pathways, the poor surface catalytic activity, the relatively low light absorption and back reactions.11–14
To achieve efficient PEC water splitting, the anode materials must satisfy several key criteria simultaneously: (1) a narrow band gap to widen the light absorption; (2) a low recombination rate to improve the charge separation; (3) a suitable band position for improving the reaction kinetics; and (4) a stable surface to resist photo-corrosion. Usually, a single semiconductor cannot fulfill all these requirements simultaneously. Thus, several strategies have be applied to improve the photocatalytic properties such as morphology design,15–17 heteroatom doping,18–21 and formation of heterojunctions.22–26 Among these strategies, heterojunction formation is effective and easy to implement. However, the challenge is how to choose a suitable candidate to pair with an existing anode material.
So far, a variety of BiVO4 semiconductor heterojunctions have been reported. For example, the coupling of BiVO4 electrodes with an iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) catalyst layer can significantly improve the O2 evolution kinetics due to the increment of the utilization efficiency of the photo-holes on the surface.27 Chae et al. fabricated the BiVO4/WO3 heterojunction to improve PEC water splitting via enhancing the charge transfer and light absorption.24 Huang et al. have reported BiVO4/Bi2O3 microspheres with high photocatalytic activity in degrading Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible-light irradiation.28 Heterojunctions can also be formed between different facets of the same crystal, such as the BiVO4(010) and BiVO4(110) surfaces. The electrons and holes can accumulate on different surfaces of BiVO4,29 which causes the space separation of electron–hole pairs. Recently, Bi2O4 with mixed valence states (Bi3+ and Bi5+) has attracted more attention for photocatalytic reactions.30–32 Notably, Bi2O4 has a smaller band gap of 2.0 eV than BiVO4,33 and is able to absorb a longer wavelength up to 620 nm. However, Bi2O4 is prone to the formation of defects, which would promote the recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs. Therefore, it is difficult to utilize Bi2O4 alone as the photoanode.34 By virtue of its inherent merits, we envisage that Bi2O4 could be designed to form a heterojunction with BiVO4 as a novel composite photoanode to enhance light harvesting and to facilitate charge separation.
In this investigation, we report a comprehensive theoretical analysis on the Bi2O4/BiVO4 heterojunction based on density functional theory calculations. The light absorption, charge separation, activity and stability of this heterojunction will be studied for its potential for solar water splitting.
2. Computational methods
CASTEP of the Materials Studio software (Accelrys Inc.) was employed for the quantum chemistry calculations. During the calculations, self-consistent periodic DFT was adopted to explore the electronic structure and catalytic activities on the facets. Ionic cores were represented by an ultrasoft pseudopotential. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation was selected as the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) method to calculate the exchange–correlation energy.35 The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) scheme was selected as the minimization algorithm.36 The DFT-D correction was used for dispersion corrections. The energy cutoff is 380 eV and the SCF tolerance is 5.0 × 10−7 eV per atom. The optimization is completed when the energy, maximum force, maximum stress and maximum displacement are smaller than 5.0 × 10−6 eV per atom, 0.01 eV Å−1, 0.02 GPa and 5.0 × 10−4 Å, respectively. A 3 × 1 × 1 supercell was used for k-point sampling during the calculations (different k-points are used to evaluate the accuracy of the calculation, Fig. S1, ESI†). These parameter settings have been verified by our previous calculations.29,37
The space groups of BiVO4 and Bi2O4 are 15, and the lattice parameters of BiVO4 are a = 7.3001 Å, b = 11.7044 Å, c = 5.1956 Å, β = 135.756°, and α = γ = 90°. The lattice parameters of Bi2O4 are a = 12.367 Å, b = 5.118 Å, c = 5.567 Å, β = 107.838°, and α = γ = 90°. Our calculated values are in good agreement with the experiment, as shown in Table S1, ESI.† During the calculations, the slabs were constructed with a vacuum region of 15 Å to avoid periodic interactions between the top and bottom of the surface.38
The BiVO4(010) facet was chosen since it is one of the most stable facets under practical conditions, and thus has been widely used to explore the structural and catalytic activities of BiVO4.39,40 A BiVO4(010) surface with a size of 5.196 × 5.094 Å2 was chosen for the computation. All low-index surfaces of Bi2O4 are considered during the calculation (Fig. S2, ESI†). It was found that only three facets (namely Bi2O4(100), Bi2O4(101), and Bi2O4(01)) are able to match with the BiVO4(010) surface in order to satisfy the angle of the surface (Table S2, ESI†). Furthermore, each Bi2O4 surface can form two types of interface models (model A and model B) with BiVO4(010), the difference between model A and model B is that Bi2O4 was rotated 90° around the Z-axis when laid on top of BiVO4(010) (Fig. S3, ESI†). The detailed surface structure and lattice parameters of all the above surfaces are shown in Fig. S4, ESI.†
The lattice mismatch, δ, can be calculated by eqn (1):41 (1)where a and b are the lattice parameters of Bi2O4 and BiVO4 on the two sides, and a > b. The maximum value (MAX δ) on the two sides was chosen as the lattice mismatch of the interface.
The interface binding energy is obtained according to eqn (2): Ebinding = EBiVO4/Bi2O4 − EBiVO4 − EBi2O4(2)where EBiVO4/Bi2O4, EBiVO4, and EBi2O4 are the total energy of the relaxed BiVO4/Bi2O4 heterostructure, isolated BiVO4 and Bi2O4 facets of the system, respectively.

Eqn (3) gives the charge density difference:42,43 Δρ = ρBiVO4/Bi2O4 − ρBiVO4 − ρBi2O4(3)where ρBiVO4/Bi2O4, ρBiVO4 and ρBi2O4 are the charge densities for the interface, isolated BiVO4, and Bi2O4 slab of the interface system.
The adsorption energy (Eads) between the surface and adsorbed particles was computed by eqn (4): Eads = Emolecule+surface − Emolecule − Esurface(4)where Emolecule+surface is the total energy of the system, including the adsorbed molecules and BiVO4 or Bi2O4 facet. Emolecule is the energy of adsorption of the molecules, and Esurface is the energy of the BiVO4 or Bi2O4 facet after optimization. By this definition, a higher negative value of Eads indicates more stable adsorption on the plane. Zero point energy (ZPE) correction was included in all calculated energies reported herein.44
The surface energy (γ) can be calculated by eqn (5):29 (5)where Ebulk is the total energy per unit cell of the bulk, n is the number of unit cells that the slab model contains, and A is the surface area of the slab model.
The bond energy can be estimated by eqn (6):45 Ebond = Eps − Eds − EBi,metal(6)where Eps is the total energy of the perfect surface, Eds is the total energy of the defective surface, and EBi,mental is the energy of a Bi atom in the metal phase.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Bi2O4/BiVO4 interface model
To form epitaxial heterojunctions, the lattice mismatch should be minimized between the BiVO4(010) and top Bi2O4 surfaces. As shown in Fig. 1a, the lattice mismatch between BiVO4 and Bi2O4(100)A, Bi2O4(100)B, Bi2O4(101)A, Bi2O4(101)B, Bi2O4(01)A, and Bi2O4(01)B is 7.1%, 9.3%, 3.7%, 1.6%, 14.6%, and 16.9%, respectively. Usually, a coherent interface is needed to avoid defect states and to form a stable interface. Based on the current calculation, the Bi2O4(101)/BiVO4(010) interfaces are coherent as their lattice mismatch is smaller than 5%, while the others are semi-coherent interfaces. Thus, the two Bi2O4(101)/BiVO4(010) interfaces were chosen to further investigate the electronic properties.

Bi (purple), V (gray), and O (red) atoms are shown as colored spheres. (c) Comparison of the binding energy before and after optimization for the Bi2O4(101)A/BiVO4(010) and Bi2O4(101)B/BiVO4(010) interfaces. (d) The comparison of the PDOS before and after optimization for selected interface layers of BiVO4 and Bi2O4. 
The optimal interface distance of BiVO4 and Bi2O4 can be obtained through single point energy calculations. The lowest binding energy for the two Bi2O4(101)/BiVO4(010) interface models (the two Bi2O4(101) surface orientations are denoted as (101)A and (101)B hereafter) corresponds to an interface layer distance of 2.09 Å and 1.941 Å, respectively (Fig. S5a, ESI†). The two interface models, Bi2O4(101)A/BiVO4(010) and Bi2O4(101)B/BiVO4(010), are illustrated in Fig. 1b. For the construction of the interface model, BiVO4(010) contains 12 Bi, 12 V and 48 O atoms, while Bi2O4(101) contains 24 Bi and 48 O atoms. During the calculations, the top two layers of the BiVO4(010) and the bottom half layer of the Bi2O4(101) surfaces are fixed to simulate the BiVO4 and Bi2O4 bulk phases.
The binding energy of the entire system before and after optimization indicates the stability of the interface. We find that before optimization the calculated Ebinding of Bi2O4(101)A/BiVO4(010) and Bi2O4(101)B/BiVO4(010) is −0.022 eV Å−2 and −0.030 eV Å−2, as shown in Fig. 1c. Interestingly, the binding energy of both models A and B has decreased by 0.348 eV Å−2 and 0.318 eV Å−2 after optimization. This is mainly due to the interaction of interface atoms during the relaxation process, thus it is necessary to investigate the detailed interaction of the interface atoms. The layers which are near the interface of BiVO4 and Bi2O4 (the green area in Fig. S5b, ESI†) are chosen to calculate the partial density of states (PDOS) for interface atoms. As shown in Fig. 1d, the conduction band moves to the right and the band gap widens after optimization for the Bi2O4 layer, this is mainly due to the resonance peaks of O 2p and Bi 6s in the conduction band, which assists the formation of more stable Bi–O bonds. Meanwhile, in the BiVO4 layer, both the valence band and conduction band move to the right after optimization, and the band gap widens. This is because O 2p and V 3d resonate significantly in the conduction band, which will form a stronger V–O bond and enhance the attraction between V and O atoms. Accordingly, after optimization the heterostructure forms a more stable interface.
3.2. Light absorption of the Bi2O4/BiVO4 heterojunction
The optical absorption of a semiconductor photocatalyst is closely related to its band gap, and is a key factor affecting its photocatalytic activity for water splitting. Hence, the absorption spectra of the BiVO4 surface, the Bi2O4 surface and the BiVO4/Bi2O4 heterojunction are calculated. The optical absorption spectra of the BiVO4(010) (3 × 1) surface, the Bi2O4(101)A surface and the Bi2O4(101)A/BiVO4(010) interface are shown in Fig. 2a.
 Fig. 2  (a) The optical absorption spectra of the BiVO4(010) (3 × 1) surface, Bi2O4(101)A surface and Bi2O4(101)A/BiVO4(010) interface (model A). (b) The optical absorption spectra of the BiVO4(010) (1 × 3) surface, Bi2O4(101)B surface and Bi2O4(101)B/BiVO4(010) interface (model B). 
For model A, it is found that BiVO4(010) shows very strong absorption of ultraviolet light, while the absorption of the visible light region (450–550 nm) is relatively weak. Furthermore, when the wavelength is smaller than 380 nm, the ultraviolet light absorption abilities of BiVO4(010) and Bi2O4(101)A are very close. However, once the wavelength is larger than 380 nm, the Bi2O4(101)A surface behaves as a stronger absorber of visible light due to its relatively narrow band gap of 2.0 eV. After forming the Bi2O4(101)A/BiVO4(010) heterostructure, the ability of light absorption is basically somewhere in between the two constituents. Compared with single BiVO4(010), the ability of visible light absorption has been much improved, which enables the heterojunction to effectively utilize more visible light for water splitting. For model B, as shown in Fig. 2b, it is found that the light absorption ability of the Bi2O4(101)B surface is weaker than that of the BiVO4(010) surface when the wavelength is smaller than 430 nm. Comparing model A and model B, the light absorption spectra are similar. Therefore, it is interesting to come to a conclusion that the formation of the Bi2O4(101)/BiVO4(010) heterostructure can improve the visible light absorption.
3.3. Charge separation properties of the Bi2O4/BiVO4 heterojunction
Charge separation is crucial for increasing the activity of semiconductor-based photo-catalytic processes.39 The charge density refers to the redistribution of charge after changes in the chemical composition or geometry of each atom in the system. It can be used as an indicator for charge separation. In this work, the charge density difference was calculated to investigate the charge separation properties of Bi2O4/BiVO4 heterojunctions. The geometric structure and electron density difference map of model A are shown in Fig. 3a (model B is similar to model A, as shown in Fig. S6a, ESI†).

(c) Schematic diagram of the possible charge separation for model A during photocatalysis. 
As shown in Fig. 3a, by comparing the Bi2O4(101)A/BiVO4(010) interface and its surfaces in model A, we can find that after forming the interface the electrons will decrease near the O atoms, whereas the electrons will increase near the Bi or V atoms. The electron density difference of model B (Fig. S6a, ESI†) is similar to model A. Accordingly, we can conclude that the charge will redistribute after forming the heterojunction.
In order to show how charges are transferred, the partial density of states (PDOS) of the Bi2O4(101)A/BiVO4(010) heterojunction with different layers is calculated, as shown in Fig. 3b (the PDOS of the Bi2O4(101)B/BiVO4(010) heterojunction with different layers is shown in Fig. S6b, ESI†). As for BiVO4 layers, it can be observed that the valence band maximum (VBM) is composed of O 2p peaks, whereas the conduction band minimum (CBM) is composed of V 3d and O 2p resonance peaks. This shows that electrons are mainly excited from the bond of O 2p orbitals to the bond of V 3d and O 2p orbitals, leaving behind photogenerated holes at the VBM. Meanwhile, the VBM of different Bi2O4 layers is occupied by O 2p orbitals and the CBM is occupied by O 2p and Bi 6s orbitals. As the VBM position of BiVO4 is lower than that of Bi2O4, holes generated from BiVO4 will tend to flow to Bi2O4, leading to effective charge separation.
To further analyze the charge transfer mechanism at the interface, the band diagram vs. NHE is obtained based on the work functions and the band gap shown in Fig. S7, ESI,† as shown in Fig. 3c (model B is shown in Fig. S8, ESI†). For model A, under light irradiation, both BiVO4 and Bi2O4 are excited, and the photogenerated holes and electrons are in their VBM and CBM, respectively. The difference of the VBM and CBM between BiVO4 and Bi2O4 is 0.78 eV and 0.29 eV, respectively, which implies that spatial charge separation between the two surfaces will occur spontaneously. The photogenerated holes will migrate to the Bi2O4 surface from the BiVO4 surface to the oxidation sites, whereas the photogenerated electrons on Bi2O4 will transfer to BiVO4. The results are consistent with the analysis of the electron density difference and PDOS.
3.4. Over-potential of the Bi2O4 and BiVO4 heterojunction for the OER
Chemical adsorption on the surface plays an important role in the activity of PEC water oxidation reactions.46–48 As is known, Bi adatoms on the BiVO4 and Bi2O4 surfaces are the active site for catalysis,49 thus only the top site of the Bi adatoms is considered in this study. The calculated Gibbs free energies during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the Bi sites of the Bi2O4(101) and BiVO4(010) surfaces are shown in Fig. 4a (the detailed derivations are in Section S2 of the ESI†).
 Fig. 4  (a) Free-energy profiles of the OER on the Bi2O4(101) and BiVO4(010) surfaces; the black line represents an ideal catalyst. The unit of the Gibbs free energy is eV. (b) Adsorption structure and energy of OHads, Oads and OOHads involved in a water-splitting process on low-index surfaces. Bi (purple), V (gray), and O (red) atoms are shown as colored spheres, the “@” sign stands for the adsorption state on the facet. 
There is only one kind of Bi site on the BiVO4 surface, whereas there are two kinds of Bi sites on the Bi2O4 surface (Fig. S9, ESI†). The three Bi sites have different abilities for water splitting. From Fig. 4a, we can find that, out of the four reaction steps, the Gibbs free energy change, ΔG, during the second step (R2) is 2.69 eV, 1.90 eV and 1.80 eV, respectively, for Bi3+ on BiVO4(010), Bi3+ on Bi2O4(101) and Bi5+ on Bi2O4(101). For an ideal catalyst with zero overpotential, this step will consume 1.23 eV energy. In this step, the OHads will release a second H adatom to generate an O adatom. We find that this process will consume more energy on account of the high positive value of ΔG and the whole reaction is mainly determined by this step. It is found that the Bi5+ site on the Bi2O4(101) surface is closer to the ideal OER catalysis process than the other sites, which indicates that the Bi5+ site is energetically more favorable for water splitting. In order to further understand the surface catalytic ability, the overpotentials of different sites were also calculated. It is found that the Bi5+ site on the Bi2O4(101) surface has a lower overpotential (0.56 eV) than the Bi3+ sites (1.66 eV for Bi2O4(101) and 1.46 eV for BiVO4(010)), which means that the Bi5+ site possesses relatively higher OER activity.
In order to investigate the reason for the high activity of the Bi5+ site, we plot detailed adsorption structures of OHads, Oads, and OOHads that are involved in the water-splitting process. As illustrated in Fig. 4b, the stable adsorption positions for most of the species are located on the top Bi sites with a small tilt. The only exception is the Oads on Bi5+ for Bi2O4(101). It is interesting to observe that Oads can easily form a Bi–O bond and O–O bond with more negative adsorption energy than the others. The more negative adsorption energy makes it easier for OHads to release another H adatom. In addition, the absorption energy of OHads and OOHads for the Bi5+ site on Bi2O4(101) is more negative than the Bi3+ site on Bi2O4(101) and BiVO4(010). This indicates more stable adsorption on the Bi2O4(101) Bi5+ site. Thus, the Bi5+ site on the Bi2O4(101) surface shows higher OER activity.
3.5. Stability of the exposed surfaces
The surface energy, related to the atomic arrangements of the surface layers, is of vital significance to estimate the surface stability of materials.50,51 The surface energies of the BiVO4(010), Bi2O4(101)A and Bi2O4(101)B are 1.77, 0.75 and 0.75 eV Å−2, respectively (Fig. 5a).
 Fig. 5  (a) Surface energy of BiVO4(010), Bi2O4(101)A and Bi2O4(101)B. (b) The geometric structure, bond energy and bond length of Bi2O4(101) (on the top) and BiVO4(010) (on the bottom). Bi (purple), V (gray), and O (red) atoms are shown as colored spheres. 
Our calculation indicates that the Bi2O4(101) surface is more stable than BiVO4(010). Furthermore, the bond energy of Bi5+ in Bi2O4(101) (−9.40 eV) is stronger than that of Bi3+ in BiVO4(010) (−7.39 eV) and Bi2O4(101) (−7.63 eV). The bond lengths of Bi–O and V–O in the BiVO4(010) surface and Bi–O in Bi2O4(101) are also labeled in Fig. 5b. The bond length of Bi–O (Bi3+) in BiVO4(010) is longer than that of Bi–O (Bi5+) in Bi2O4(101). This is mainly attributed to the fact that the electron affinity of Bi atoms is larger than V atoms, which leads to a stronger capacity of V atoms to trap the outer electrons of adjacent O atoms to generate Bi3+ and VO43−. Accordingly, the absence of strong electron affinity atoms in Bi2O4 results in a short Bi–O bond length and makes Bi2O4 more stable. And the Bi5+ in Bi2O4(101) are more stable than the Bi3+ in BiVO4(010). As for Bi3+ in BiVO4(010) and Bi2O4(101), the bond length of Bi–O in BiVO4(010) is longer than that of Bi2O4(101). Meanwhile, the Bi3+ is 3-fold coordinated in BiVO4(010) and 6-fold coordinated in Bi2O4(101). Furthermore, the bond energy of Bi3+ in Bi2O4(101) is more negative than that of BiVO4(010). Thus, the Bi3+ in Bi2O4(101) are more stable than the Bi3+ in BiVO4(010). It is also found that the photogenerated holes cannot be consumed quickly enough by the water reaction, and thus they are accumulated on the BiVO4 surface. This is the primary cause that induces BiVO4 anodic photocorrosion.52–54 Interestingly, this work finds that forming the Bi2O4/BiVO4 heterojunction will effectively improve the ability to resist photo-corrosion compared to BiVO4, due to the effective charge separation as discussed before.
To sum up, Bi5+ in Bi2O4(101) is more stable than Bi3+ in Bi2O4(101), and Bi3+ in Bi2O4(101) is more stable than Bi3+ in BiVO4(010). In addition, the Bi2O4/BiVO4 heterojunction is more stable than BiVO4.
4. Conclusions
In this paper, a comprehensive theoretical analysis was carried out on the geometric structure, light absorption, activity and stability of the exposed surfaces of the Bi2O4/BiVO4 heterojunction. The result shows that BiVO4(010) can form a coherent interface with Bi2O4(101), the negative binding energy of the two types of interface means that the interfaces are stable. As for the light absorption capacity, Bi2O4 can assist to improve BiVO4 to utilize more visible light for water splitting after forming the heterojunctions. By analyzing the charge density difference and PDOS of the interface, we find that the Bi2O4(101)/BiVO4(010) heterojunctions have good charge separation performance. Under light irradiation, the photogenerated holes will migrate to the Bi2O4 surface from BiVO4(010), whereas the photogenerated electrons on the Bi2O4 surface can transfer to BiVO4(010). Furthermore, the calculation of absorbed intermediates during the water-splitting process indicates that the OER on the BiVO4 and Bi2O4 surface is mainly determined by H adatom release and O adatom generation. The Bi5+ site on Bi2O4(101) is energetically more favorable as the photoanode for water splitting than the Bi3+ sites on Bi2O4(101) and BiVO4(010). In terms of stability, Bi2O4(101) (Bi5+) is more stable than BiVO4(010) (Bi3+) and Bi2O4(101) (Bi3+). The binding energy of Bi2O4(101) is found to be more negative than BiVO4(010), which supports the conclusion that the former is more stable. Our study has provided insights into the electronic properties of the Bi2O4/BiVO4 heterojunction for the water oxidation reaction, and the obtained understanding is useful for the design and fabrication of electrode materials for solar energy conversion devices.
