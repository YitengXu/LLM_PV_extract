    , Accepted 9th June 2023First published on 9th June 2023AbstractThe combination of halide perovskite NCs with graphene to design heterostructures has proven to be a promising candidate for energy applications, optoelectronics, and photocatalysis. Efficient light energy absorption in perovskite NC-graphene heterostructures is of fundamental importance owing to their optoelectronic applications. A detailed understanding of the important process for device action, particularly interfacial charge transfer (CT), has thus far lingered subtly. This study describes the influence of the different surface functionalities of graphene on the CT dynamics in FAPbBr3 NCs attached to functionalized graphene heterostructures. Functionalized graphenes i.e., graphene oxide (GO) and amino acids (alanine (Ala), tyrosine (Tyr) and cysteine (Cys)) functionalized GO, were synthesized. By assembling the heterostructures of functionalized graphene with NCs, the quenching of photoluminescence (PL) of the FAPbBr3 NCs was observed. The photo-generated hole transfer from FAPbBr3 to functionalized graphene is responsible for PL quenching, which is supported by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis. Our study revealed that the rate of CT and charge transfer efficiency (ECT) strongly depend on the nature of the functionalizing moieties. The highest hole transfer efficiency for NC-functionalized graphene heterostructures was observed in the case of cysteine-functionalized GO (88.84%) and the lowest with GO (38.15%). This suggests that cysteine-functionalized graphene is the best hole acceptor amongst all functionalized graphenes. This study offers a method to regulate energetics and investigate the extent of hole transfer in perovskite NCs and functionalized graphene heterostructures. These findings tend to draw new directions to stimulate advance research regarding the fundamental understanding of hole transfer in surface-modified donor–acceptor heterostructures for light harvesting assemblies, especially solar cells.
1. Introduction
Currently, two-dimensional (2D) materials dominate the modern optoelectronic research field owing to their various active sites, large surface area, strong connection at interface, and number of layer-dependent electronic structures.1 Some 2D materials, such as phospherene,2 MoS2,3 WS2,3 WSe2,1 graphene,4,5 and Mxenes,6 have attracted attention in different energy applications in this regard. Among these materials, graphene has attracted significant attention since its discovery in 2004. The excellent electronic, optical, chemical, and physical properties of graphene7–10 have made it a prominent candidate for electrochemical,8,9 optoelectronic,10 and biological11 applications. The electrical and chemical properties of graphene can be tuned by chemical doping or by introducing a functional group.10 The doping or functionalization not only controls the charge carrier density but also regulates the electron or hole accepting ability by modifying the electronic structure of the graphene.12 The decoration of graphene with different functional groups is a practical method that is used to tune its properties for various applications in the field of photovoltaics13 and optoelectronics.13
The hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite lead halides dictate present photovoltaic technologies owing to their remarkable properties of composition-dependent size and band gap control,14 emission tunability,15 long-range carrier diffusion length,16 low-cost facile solution processing,17 high power conversion efficiency,18 and high charge carrier mobilities.19 Since their first use in dye-sensitized solar cells in 200920 with an efficiency of 3.81%, more efforts have been made to enhance the performance21,22 and environmental stability of perovskite solar cells by optimizing their chemical composition, process of crystallization, surface morphology, and interface engineering.23–25 In particular, hybrid perovskites have proven themselves as a major candidate for the fabrication of modern generation solar cell devices by achieving the highest power conversion efficiency compared to other cell devices.26
Recently, the study of charge transfer (CT) in heterostructures comprising different multidimensional donor–acceptor heterojunctions of FAPbBr3 NCs with materials, such as g-C3N4,27 Ti3C2,28,29 WO3, α-Fe2O3,30 C60, carbon nanotubes, TiO2,31 and Bi2WO6,32 has emerged as a striking field. Because of better photo response, excellent water oxidation, photocatalysis, efficient reduction of CO2 and improved optoelectronic features.23–27 The design of heterostructures utilizing halide perovskites and low-dimensional materials is a practical approach for enhancing charge separation by reducing charge recombination.
In this study, to the best of our knowledge, the photoexcited hole transfer dynamics in the heterojunction of FAPbBr3 NCs with biologically compatible environmentally friendly amino acid-functionalized graphene are studied. Herein, the fabricated heterojunctions of FAPbBr3 NCs with GO and GO-functionalized amino acids, such as alanine (Ala), tyrosine (Tyr), and cysteine (Cys), reveal PL quenching in the heterostructures. The GO was synthesized by employing modified Hummers’ method.33 The aforementioned amino acids were selected to synthesize the functionalized GO, and then the heterostructures of FAPbBr3 NCs were fabricated with GO and all amino acid-functionalized GO samples. The PL studies of NCs in heterostructures show that functionalized graphene quenches the PL of FAPbBr3 NCs. The quenching ability of functionalized graphene depends highly on the size and nature of the functionalizing moiety. Time-resolved PL studies of bare NCs and NCs in heterostructures suggest that the PL lifetime of the charge carriers significantly decreases in heterostructures. The PL decay kinetics analysis corroborated the cyclic voltametric analysis, suggesting that the transfer of photoexcited holes from FAPbBr3 NCs to functionalized graphene is the main reason for PL quenching. It is further revealed that the hole accepting ability of graphene can greatly be tuned by the surface functionalization of the graphene. Thus, it is deduced that functionalized graphene can act as a good hole acceptor and can be utilized as hole extraction material in light harvesting devices, especially solar cells.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Characterization of functionalized graphene
The GO was synthesized by employing modified Hummers’ method.33 Amino acids, including alanine, tyrosine and cysteine, were selected to synthesize bio-compatible, eco-friendly surface-decorated graphene. The oxidation of graphite and transformation to GO is performed by introducing –COOH, –OH and –C–O–C– moieties between the layers of graphene. The presence of these functional moieties results in the exfoliation of graphene layers. GO can be further modified in terms of its properties by substituting these functional moieties of GO with different compounds. Amino acids are inexpensive, bio-compatible, and environment friendly, and they possess good nucleophilic properties. Hence, amino acids are regarded as beneficial for the surface functionalization of graphene. As represented in Scheme 1, during the synthesis of amino acid-functionalized GO from GO, nucleophilic condensation reactions occur between the –COOH groups of GO and –NH2 groups of the amino acids. The functionalized GO is characterized by employing various techniques described in the subsequent paragraphs.
 Scheme 1  Schematic of surface functionalization of GO with amino acids: Ala, Tyr, and Cys. 
The morphological analysis of the functionalized graphene is conducted using SEM, and the micrographs are presented in Fig. 1. The functionalized graphene exists in innate sheet-like morphology,34 while aggregation is observed in the SEM micrographs of amino acid-functionalized GO. The aggregation among sheets is due to the interaction developed between different polar groups that are connected to functionalized graphene sheets. The extent of layer aggregation varies in differently prepared samples. This indicates the presence of different functional groups of amino acids on the surface of the GO. Clear topographical differences among the different samples can be observed. The difference in the morphology of GO and amino acid-functionalized GO could be due to the additional functionalization of GO with different amino acids. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis of all functionalized graphenes is also performed to confirm the presence of different elements in the synthesized samples. The EDX analysis of GO confirms the presence of only C and O in GO samples, while the EDX of GO-Ala confirms the presence of C, O and N in the samples. The presence of N in amino acid-functionalized GO confirms amino acid functionalization. In the case of GO-Cys, the signal of the S element is also observed along with the signals of C, O and N. This is because the cysteine amino acid contains thiol (–SH) functionality in addition to amino (–NH2) and carboxylic acid groups (–COOH) functionalities. The observed weight and atom percentages of the elements in the different synthesized samples are depicted in Table S1 in the ESI.†

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the functionalized graphene are presented in Fig. 2. The XRD pattern of GO contains a diffraction peak centered at 11.41° assigned to the (001) diffraction plane of GO, which is attributed to the interlayer distance of 8.06 Å.33 This peak signifies the presence of numerous oxygen containing moieties on the surface of graphene with increased interlayer spacing because of the interactions of oxygen containing moieties. The XRD patterns of all amino acid-functionalized graphenes clearly differ from the XRD patterns of GO. The diffraction peak observed in the diffraction pattern of GO is not observed in the XRD patterns of amino acid-functionalized GO, indicating that graphene sheets are loosely stacked with each other and graphene layers are non-smectic. The diffraction peaks of amino acid non-smectic graphene oxide are shifted towards higher 2θ values, indicating a high degree of the reduction of GO (decrease in the number of oxygen containing moieties). A decrease in interlayer spacing is also observed because of the introduction of amino acids to the surface of graphene. The diffraction peaks of GO-Cys, GO-Ala, and GO-Tyr are centered at 19.01°, 26.66° and 29.33° and are assigned to an interlayer spacing of 4.62, 3.35, and 3.04 Å, respectively. Amongst amino acid-functionalized graphene samples, the interlayer spacing in GO-Tyr is observed to be the smallest, and its diffraction plane intensity is comparatively greater. This is because the aromatic ring of tyrosine is preferably oriented parallel to the plane of the aromatic ring of graphene by π–π stacking interactions.35 As a result of these additional interactions and other types of intermolecular interactions, the GO-Tyr possesses a specifically scrolled structure between graphene and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, which is similar to rolling a single layer of graphene, as reported previously.35 It is noteworthy that the amino acid-functionalized GO XRD patterns show that the graphene layers are significantly exfoliated and do not recombine by introducing amino acids on the surface of graphene. This can be attributed to the highly random arrangement of N-containing moieties of amino acids on the surface of graphene sheets.

FTIR analysis is employed to understand the bonding interactions in GO and amino acid functionalized graphene, as depicted in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The FTIR spectrum of GO displays all the relevant signals of oxygen containing functional groups, which confirms the successful transformation of graphite to GO. In the FTIR spectrum of the GO, strong absorption signals around 3300, 1721, and 1600 cm−1 are caused by the vibrational modes of O–H, CO and C–O, respectively, which are present in COOH and C–O–C (epoxy).36 After the amino acid functionalization of GO, the reduction in signals of the oxygen containing groups confirms the functionalization of GO. The wide and less intense peak at ∼3300 cm−1 (indicating the loss of oxygen containing moieties) can be assigned to the N–H stretching vibration of the amine groups with less intensity and symmetric peak shape. The band of amino acid functionalization can be found at ∼1580 cm−1 and is assigned to the in plane stretching of the –NH group of amino acids. The signal of the CO stretch appearing at 1721 cm−1 shifts to 1628 cm−1, corresponding to the amide (–CO–NH–) of amino acid-functionalized GO, which confirms the functionalization of GO with amino acids. Moreover, the band appearing at 871 cm−1 can be assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibrational mode of the –NH moiety. These results suggest the successful functionalization of GO with amino acids, as reported previously that the surface functionalization of graphene with amino acids is caused by the condensation reaction of –COOH groups of GO with the –NH2 group of amino acids.36,37 Table S2 (ESI†) summarizes the observed peaks in the FTIR spectra of functionalized graphene.
The Raman spectra of GO and amino-functionalized GO are illustrated in Fig. 3(a). In the Raman spectrum of GO, a peak centering at 1599 cm−1 is observed (G band) that originates from the E2g phonon of the sp2-hybridized carbon, and another peak at 1320 cm−1 (D band) corresponds to the breathing mode of k-point phonons of A1g symmetry. In the case of GO-Tyr, GO-Ala, and GO-Cys, slightly shifted G-band centering at 1594, 1596 and 1602 cm−1 is observed, respectively. Similarly, the D-bands of the amino acid-functionalized graphene oxide are also shifted. In the case of GO-Tyr, Gr-Ala and GO-Cys, the shifted D-band centering at 1317, 1313 and 1330 cm−1 is observed, respectively. The ratio of the intensity of these bands (ID/IG) specifies the quality of the product. The ratio of ID/IG increases during the transformation of GO to amino acid-functionalized GO. For instance, for GO, GO-Tyr, GO-Ala, and GO-Cys, the calculated values of ID/IG are 0.74, 1.32, 1.34, and 1.36, respectively. The difference in values of ID/IG represents that the introduction of amino acid moieties in GO decreases the defects by the restoration of the benzene ring. Because the presence of an amino group on the surface of graphene reduces, the oxygen containing functionalities of GO increase the number of graphene layers.38,39
 Fig. 3  (a) Raman and (b) UV-Vis absorption spectra of GO, GO-Tyr, GO-Ala, and GO-Cys. 
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of functionalized graphene are recorded in water, as presented in Fig. 3(b). In the absorption spectrum of GO, two peaks are observed at 274 nm and 220 nm, which are assigned to n–π* and π–π* transitions, respectively.40 In the case of the introduction of amino acid in GO, the peak position of the n–π* transition remains unchanged, but GO-Ala and GO-Cys absorption peaks display reduced intensity, indicating that the functionalized graphene contains fewer moieties that show this particular transition. However, the peak position of π–π* transition shifted in amino acid-functionalized GO in such a way that GO-Tyr and GO-Cys show a red-shifted peak at 224 and 229 nm, respectively, indicating the presence of amino acid on the surface of GO. The red shift in the absorption peak can be attributed to the partial deoxygenation and restoration of electronic conjugation in the aromatic structure, as reported previously.41 In the case of GO-Ala, a slight blue-shifted peak at 215 nm is observed, indicating that the introduction of alanine on the surface of GO reduces the number of O containing moieties owing to the re-establishment of conjugated structure.42 Hence, the presence of different functional groups also tunes the band gap of graphene.
2.2 Characterization of FAPbBr3 NCs/functionalized graphene heterostructures
The XRD patterns of the FAPbBr3 NCs and NCs/graphene heterostructures are displayed in Fig. 4. The XRD pattern of the NCs is well indexed with the cubic crystalline phase of FAPbBr3 (JCD 87-0158).43,44 There is no observable change in the peak position of the XRD patterns of NCs in the presence of functionalized graphene, i.e., GO, GO-Cys, GO-Tyr, and GO-Ala. However, a decrease in the peak intensity is observed, suggesting that the presence of functionalized graphene causes amorphousness and irregularity in the crystal structures of NCs. Owing to the presence of slight amorphous nature, the diffraction peaks of the functionalized graphene do not appear in the XRD patterns of heterostructures.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of FAPbBr3 NCs and NCs/functionalized graphene, i.e., NCs/GO, NCs/GO-Ala, NCs/GO-Tyr, and NCs/GO-Cys heterostructures. 
The association of FAPbBr3 NCs with functionalized graphene can also be observed in TEM and HRTEM images, as shown in Fig. 5(a)–(f). The NCs possess spherical morphology and are embedded in the networks of functionalized graphene, as depicted in Fig. 5(a), (c), (e) and (g). The occurrence of the 0.24, 0.29, and 0.21 nm fringe spacing corresponds to (211), (200), and (220) diffraction planes of NCs, and 0.81, 0.33, 0.44, and 0.31 nm fringe spacing in GO, GO-Ala, GO-Cys, and GO-Tyr in NCs/functionalized graphene heterostructures confirm the presence of the respective components of each heterostructure.

The chemical nature of the binding interactions in the NCs/functionalized graphene heterostructures is understood by performing an FTIR analysis of the heterostructures, as depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†). In the FTIR spectra of oleylamine-capped FAPbBr3 NCs, the peaks at 1200–1300 cm−1 and 1700–1750 cm−1 are assigned to the C–O bending and CO stretching mode of vibrations of oleylamine. The N–H stretching (3000–3300 cm−1), C–N stretching (1020–1200 cm−1), C–H stretching (2850–3000 cm−1) and N–H bending (1650 cm−1) vibrations confirm the oleylamine functionalization of FAPbBr3 NCs.43 The van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding developed amongst the different functional moieties of functionalized graphene (CO, C–O, O–H, –NH2, O–C–OH, and –SH), and oleylamine capped FAPbBr3 NCs are responsible for the formation of heterostructures. The change in the transmittance intensity of the FTIR spectra, along with the widening of peak signals (Fig. S2, ESI†) of the aforementioned groups, confirms the formation of polar interactions in the NCs/functionalized graphene heterostructures.
2.3 Fluorescence quenching of FAPbBr3 NCs by functionalized graphene
The PL spectra of FAPbBr3 NCs and FAPbBr3 NCs coupled with surface-decorated graphene are depicted in Fig. 6(a). The bare FAPbBr3 NCs show a PL peak maximum at 544 nm with a narrow full width at half maxima (FWHM of ∼25 nm). The measured intense PL is attributed to the excitonic transitions of FAPbBr3 and agrees with the previously reported PL spectra of FAPbBr3 NCs.44,45 The PL spectra of GO and amino acid-functionalized GO depicted no peak in the observable emission range, demonstrating the non-emissive nature of these systems (Fig. S3, ESI†). The PL of FAPbBr3 NCs is effectively quenched when combined with GO, GO-Cys, GO-Tyr, and GO-Ala. In heterojunctions, two main plausible mechanisms could be responsible for the quenching of the PL: nonradiative energy transfer or CT. For energy transfer, the overlap of the emission spectrum of the donor with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor is a prerequisite.46 Because of CT, the emission intensity of the donor decreases and that of the acceptor generally increases. An effective reduction in the PL intensity of FAPbBr3 NCs is observed in FAPbBr3 NCs/functionalized graphene heterostructures, as depicted in Fig. 6(a). Owing to the non-emissive nature of all functionalized graphene, no PL is observed for the functionalized graphene. From these results, it can be deduced that the FAPbBr3 NCs acted as donors and functionalized graphene acted as acceptors in the heterostructures. Considering the energy transfer, the occurrence of energy transfer could be minimal as there is no overlap of the absorption spectra of all functionalized graphene samples with the emission spectrum of the FAPbBr3 NCs (Fig. S4, ESI†).47 Therefore, photoexcited CT from FAPbBr3 to the functionalized graphene is a plausible mechanism of the PL quenching of FAPbBr3 NCs. The extent of PL quenching is maximum in GO-Cys and minimum in the case of GO. The intermolecular interactions between oleylamine-functionalized NCs with different functional moieties of surface-decorated graphene are responsible for effective association and the formation of the heterostructures of the NCs and the functionalized GO. In the heterostructures, the PL of the NCs is quenched owing to photoexcited CT from the NCs to the GO.
 Fig. 6  (a) PL spectra and (b) PL decay kinetics of FAPbBr3 NCs and FAPbBr3 NCs/GO, FAPbBr3 NCs/GO-Ala, FAPbBr3 NCs/GO-Tyr and FAPbBr3 NC/GO-Cys heterostructures. 
To investigate the direct interaction of bare amino acids with FAPbBr3 NCs, the PL spectra of the NCs in toluene in the absence and presence of amino acids are carried out, and the corresponding spectra are displayed in Fig. S5 in ESI.† The amino acids being polar do not solubilize in the pure anhydrous toluene or into the solution of NCs in toluene even after a stirring of half an hour under the same conditions (Fig. S6, ESI†). There is no change in PL intensity and the peak shift (Fig. S5, ESI†), thus eliminating the possibility of direct interaction of amino acids with NCs.
The PL kinetics analysis demonstrates an outstanding trend in the PL quenching of FAPbBr3 NCs in relationship with different functionalized graphene samples in heterostructures, as depicted in Fig. 6(b). The resultant PL decay kinetics after excitation at 306 nm is best fitted by the bi-exponential decay function as follows: A(t) = A1e(−t/τ1) + A2e(−t/τ2),(1)where A1 and A2 are the associated weighting coefficients, and τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow time constants of each component of the PL lifetime, respectively. The fast component of PL lifetime (τ1) is associated with trap-state-assisted radiative recombination, while the slow component (τ2) is attributed to excitonic recombination, as reported previously.48 All the extracted PL decay kinetics parameters from the best fits are listed in Table 1. From the parameters, the average PL lifetime of all samples is calculated using the following equation: (2)

The average PL lifetime of bare FAPbBr3 NCs (donor) is the longest (∼26.81 ns), which decreases to 2.99 ns for donor–acceptor heterostructures depending on the nature of the functionalities present on the surface of graphene. Table 1 shows the PL decay lifetimes of the NCs of the various heterostructures. Amongst all heterostructures, the shortest PL lifetime (2.99 ns) is demonstrated by NCs combined with GO-Cys because of the maximum PL quenching. These results demonstrate that cysteine-decorated GO is the best charge acceptor amongst other amino acid-functionalized graphene samples. PL decay kinetics is used to estimate various CT parameters. Using τDA (average PL lifetime of the FAPbBr3 NCs in the presence of acceptor graphene) and τD (average PL lifetime of the donor NCs only), the CT efficiency (ECT) is evaluated using the following equation: (3)
The rate constant for CT is estimated using the relation given in the following equation:46 (4)
The values of ECT and CT rate constant (kCT) are given in Table 1. The highest charge transfer efficiency (88.84%) is observed when the NCs are coupled with GO-Cys, whereas the lowest transfer efficiency (38.15%) is observed when the NCs are coupled with GO and other heterojunctions. The calculated values occur between these two limits. The comparative values of kCT suggest that an increase CT rate kCT is 2.30 × 107, 9.04 × 107, 1.09 × 108, and 2.97 × 108 s−1 for NCs/GO, NCs/GO-Ana, NCs/GO-Tyr, and NCs/GO-Cys, respectively. The calculated ECT and kCT values demonstrate that the CT process is strongly influenced by the nature of the different functional moieties used for the surface decoration of graphene.
Following pulsed excitation at 306 nm FAPbBr3 NCs, electron and hole (charge carriers) pair are generated in the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB), respectively. In the absence of a quencher, the photoexcited charge carriers recombine radiatively. In heterostructures, the interaction of surface-decorated graphene with NCs results in the development of potential at the interface of NCs and surface-decorated graphene. The development of this potential at the interface of the heterostructure of NCs/functionalized graphene inhibits the direct recombination of photoinjected charge carriers and favors the spatial separation of charge carriers, as reported previously.49 The photogenerated charge carriers effectively separate at the interface of FAPbBr3 NCs/functionalized graphene heterojunctions and thus promote the CT process.
2.4 Electrochemical measurements
To apprehend the type of CT, electron or hole between NCs and functionalized graphene, the band edge positions are estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and cyclic voltammograms (CVs), as presented in Fig. 7. The electrochemical band edges are estimated by recording CVs in a non-aqueous environment using three electrode systems: platinum wire acting as a counter electrode, glassy carbon acting as a working electrode, and silver wire acting as a reference electrode. The resultant CVs are depicted in Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†). The onset oxidation (EOx) and reduction (ERed) potentials are used to estimate the electrochemical lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or conduction band (CB) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or valence band (VB) in eV unit:50 VB or EHOMO = −e (EOxvs.NHE + 4.75) (eV)(5) CB or ELUMO = −e (ERed,vs.NHE + 4.75) (eV)(6) ENHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.197(7)
 Fig. 7  (a)–(d) Band edge estimation of FAPbBr3 NCs and functionalized graphene, i.e., GO, GO-Cys, GO-Ala, and GO-Tyr by CV analyses. 
The positions of VB and CB of the NCs are found to be at −6.40 eV and −4.30 eV, respectively. The calculated values of HOMO are −5.71, −6.24, −5.84, and −5.90 eV, and LUMO levels are −4.00, −3.79, −3.89 and −4.18 eV for GO, GO-Cys, GO-Ala and GO-Tyr, respectively. From the value of the HOMO and LUMO levels of functionalized graphene, it can be clearly observed that surface functionalization greatly affects the HOMO and LUMO levels of the graphene. The estimated LUMO and HOMO levels of the functionalized graphene and NCs are presented in Fig. 7(a)–(d). The respective energy level alignment of the two materials forming heterostructures indicates that the NC-functionalized graphene forms type-II heterojunctions (possibility of electron transfer from LUMO of functionalized graphene to CB of NCs and hole transfer from VB of NCs to HOMO of functionalized graphene). Hence, from these results, we conclude that the hole transfer from NCs to functionalized graphene is responsible for the PL quenching, which is also supported by steady-state and time-resolved PL analyses. The difference between the position of the VB of NCs and the HOMO level of different surface-decorated graphene samples also changes with variations in the surface moieties on graphene. The smallest difference in the VB of NCs and the HOMO of functionalized graphene is observed in the case of GO-Cys (0.16 eV), whereas the largest is observed in the case of GO (0.69 eV). The difference between GO-Ala and GO-Tyr is 0.56 and 0.5 eV, respectively. These results suggest that owing to the smaller energy difference between the VB of NCs and the HOMO of GO-Cys, the possibility of hole transfer in the FAPbBr3 NCs/GO-Cy heterostructure is the easiest amongst all other heterostructures. These findings also agree with the PL and TRPL studies, where strong PL quenching and greater kCT are observed in the case of FAPbBr3 NCs/GO-Cy heterostructure.
3. Conclusion
In this study, the CT phenomenon in FAPbBr3 NCs/functionalized graphene heterostructures was examined. Herein, various functionalized graphene samples, i.e., GO, GO-Cys, GO-Ala and GO-Tyr, were prepared, and their heterostructures were assembled with FAPbBr3 NCs. The PL quenching of photoexcited FAPbBr3 NCs when coupled with functionalized graphene occurred, indicating the quenching ability of functionalized graphene. PL quenching occurred owing to the photoexcited CT. The CT efficiency and CT rate were also evaluated by PL decay kinetics analysis. The comparative values of kCT are 2.30 × 107, 9.04 × 107, 1.09 × 108, and 2.97 × 108 s−1 for NCs/GO, NCs/GO-Ana, NCs/GO-Tyr, and NCs/GO-Cys, respectively, indicating that the highest kCT was observed for NCs/GO-Cys heterostructure. This led to the conclusion that the ECT and kCT in NCs/surface-decorated graphene heterostructures highly depended on the nature of the functionalizing moiety. Amongst all functionalized graphene samples, GO-Cys possessed the highest ECT (88.84%) whereas GO possessed the lowest (38.15%). These results showed that GO-Cys is the best charge acceptor amongst all other functionalized graphene samples. The CV measurements demonstrated that the PL of the FAPbBr3 NCs was quenched because of the photoexcited hole transfer from the NCs to the functionalized graphene. From these results, we concluded that the functionalized graphene can not only act as hole acceptor material in light harvesting assemblies when combined with FAPbBr3 NCs but their hole accepting ability could also be tuned by selecting a suitable surface ligand molecule. This study elucidates the fundamental understanding of photoinduced hole transfer in perovskite NCs/functionalized graphene heterostructures, which will trigger an understanding of the type of CT in various nanostructured heterojunctions.
4 Experimental section
4.1 Chemicals
Graphite powder (≥99%, DAE JUNG), formamidinium acetate (FAAc) (99%, Sigma Aldrich), lead bromide (PbBr2) (≥99%, Uni Chem), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (99%, Sigma Aldrich), hydrochloric acid (HCl) (99.8%, Sigma Aldrich), potassium manganese oxide (KMnO4) (99%, Sigma Aldrich), sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (99%, Sigma Aldrich), tetrabutylammonium hexefluorophosphate (TBAPF6) (98%, Sigma Aldrich), toluene (99%, Sigma Aldrich), sulphuric acid (H2SO4) (98%, Sigma Aldrich), acetonitrile (99.7%, Sigma Aldrich), absolute ethanol (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), 1-propanol (≥ 98%, Fluka), oleylamine (OAm) (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), oleic acid (OA) (99.9% DAE JUNG), alanine (98%, Sigma Aldrich), cysteine (98%, Sigma Aldrich), tyrosine (98%, Sigma Aldrich), sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (98%, Sigma Aldrich) and hexane (99.7%, Sigma Aldrich).
4.2 Preparation of functionalized graphene
Hummers’ method is employed to synthesize graphene oxide (GO).33 Concisely, powder graphite (0.5 g), NaNO3 (0.25 g) and KMnO4 (1.5 g) were mixed in H2SO4 (12 mL) by maintaining the 0 °C by employing an ice bath with constant stirring. Afterwards, the ice bath was removed, and the temperature of the reaction was increased to 100 °C for one and a half hour. Sufficient deionized (DI) water and 30% H2O2 (2 mL) were also added to the reaction mixture to carry out oxidation. The obtained yellow solution of GO was cleaned many times with DI water and 10% HCl to eliminate metal ions, and the obtained solid was dried at 60 °C in an oven.
The functionalization of graphene is carried out by employing three different amino acids using a previously reported method.35 Briefly, GO powder (0.1 g) was mixed in DI water (10 mL). Subsequently, 0.3 g of amino acid (alanine, cysteine, or tyrosine) was added to the GO solution under constant stirring. Afterwards, an equimolar NaOH solution in 10 mL of DI water was added to the previous GO and amino acid reaction mixture. The reaction was left and stirred overnight under room conditions. The 10 mL of ethanol was added into the resulting colloidal mixture, and the product was separated by centrifugation. The obtained raw product was washed with ethanol/water solution (to remove left-over NaOH) until the neutral product was obtained. The obtained precipitates were dried at 60 °C in an oven.
4.3 Synthesis of formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) NCs
A facile synthesis procedure was adopted for the synthesis of FAPbBr3 NCs.44 Briefly, 1 mL of lead bromide precursor solution was prepared by taking 185 mg mL−1 of lead bromide in a vial and adding 1-propanol, oleylamine and oleic acid in a ratio of 1:1:1 by volume. The lead bromide precursor solution was heated to 80 °C under continuous stirring. In the meantime, 18 mg of formamidinium acetate (FAAc) was dissolved in 3 mL of 1-propanol. After mixing, 6 mL of hexane was added to the resulting solution and stirred for a few minutes. 0.9 mL of lead bromide precursor solution was injected quickly into the FAAc precursor solution, and green emitting FAPbBr3 NCs were obtained within a few seconds. The obtained product was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 2 min to separate the large aggregated particles, and the supernatant was preserved. For the separation of the NCs, the solution was washed 3 times with toluene/acetonitrile (9:1) solution and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min for the collection of solid FAPbBr3 NCs. The obtained NCs were dried at 60 °C in an oven for further use. These NCs were characterized by TEM, HRTEM, SAED, XRD, UV-Vis, steady-state and time-resolved PL techniques (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†).
4.4 Formation of FAPbBr3 NCs/functionalized graphene heterostructures
1 mg of GO, GO-Cys, GO-Tyr, and GO-Ala was dispersed in 10 mL of toluene (Fig. S11 in ESI†), and each 1 mL of dispersion was mixed with 5 mL of 1 mg FAPbBr3 NCs in toluene solution and continuously stirred for half an hour at 40 °C. The ensuing FAPbBr3 NCs/functionalized graphene heterostructures were used for further studies. To investigate whether the amino acids interact directly with the NCs, 1 mg of alanine, cysteine, and tyrosine were also dissolved in toluene. Being polar in nature, amino acids were not dissolved in anhydrous toluene even after stirring/sonicating for half an hour. Then, 0.1 mg of each amino acid was directly added to the solution of NCs and left on stirring for half an hour under the same conditions (Fig. S6, ESI†). Apparently, the amino acids were still insoluble. However, the PL studies of the samples were carried out for comparison (Fig. S5, ESI†).
5 Material characterization
For crystal structure analysis of synthesized materials, powder XRD was conducted by utilizing a PANalytical X-ray diffractometer operating at 45 kV and 40 mA with a Cu Ka (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation source. FTIR studies were carried out using a BRUKER TENSOR-II spectrometer. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed using a Thermo Scientific Apreo S microscope. A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM), Philips CM 30, JEOL, JEM-2100F was used to conduct the microstructural analysis of the samples. Raman spectra of graphene oxide and amino acid functionalized graphene were recorded using a Renishaw Raman spectrophotometer. The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the materials were recorded using a UV-Vis Shimadzu 1601 spectrophotometer. The PL spectra and PL decay kinetics were analyzed using Pico-Quant Fluo Time 300, FT-300, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectrometer that operated on the principle of time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique, as described previously.51,52 The PL spectra and kinetics were recorded after excitation at 306 nm with a pulsed LED excitation source in toluene solvent at room temperature. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) for NCs and functionalized graphene were recorded by the CH1660B electrochemistry workstation.
