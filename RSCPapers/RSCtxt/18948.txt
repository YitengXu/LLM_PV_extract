    , Accepted 11th May 2020First published on 13th May 2020AbstractThe effect of cationic chlorides has been studied to achieve high quality perovskite films, for high performance perovskite solar cells. However, the role of cationic chloride additives which form mixed-cations on the perovskite structure is still unclear. Investigating the crystal morphology and stability of perovskite films for various sizes or concentrations of cationic chlorides is an essential part of the optoelectronic perovskite study. This paper investigates how cationic chlorides GuCl, FACl, CsCl, RbCl, and KCl, with different cationic sizes and concentrations, affected FAPbI3 perovskite. By forming mixed-cations by the addition of cationic chlorides with appropriate cation size and concentration, based on the tolerance factor, the crystallinity of the perovskite film was improved, achieving a lifetime 2.50 times longer, and a grain size 2.44 times larger. As a result, the efficiency of the perovskite solar cells is increased to 23.28%, and certified as 22.65% at Newport with optimized cationic chlorides. To understand the effect of the cation size and concentration of the cationic chlorides, theoretical analysis of the mechanism by which the cationic chlorides increased the crystallinity was performed using density functional theory calculations. The results revealed the effect of the various cationic chlorides on perovskite phase structures and matched the experimental results.
Introduction
Over the last several years, organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have become increasingly popular materials for photovoltaic devices. Their numerous advantages in photovoltaic devices, including high absorption coefficients,1 long carrier lifetimes,2–4 low exciton binding energy,5 and band gap tunability,4 have been widely studied. Thanks to the outstanding properties of these perovskite materials, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells reached over 25% within a few years of their emergence.6
Perovskite materials used in solar cells have an ABX3 structure,7,8 where A is the +1 charge cation methylammonium (MA+), formamidinium (FA+), or cesium (Cs+); B is +2 charge lead (Pb2+) or tin (Sn2+); and X is −1 charge chloride (Cl−), bromide (Br−), or iodide (I−).9,10 Among these perovskite material combinations, formamidinium lead iodide FAPbI3-based perovskite materials have been widely used as light-harvesting materials because FAPbI3 has a broader light absorption spectrum11 and this results in high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.12,13
Generally, FAPbI3 has two crystal structures, a non-perovskite yellow δ-phase and a perovskite black α-phase, which have totally different electrical and optical properties. The α-phase perovskite has a good crystal structure, which makes it an effective light-harvesting material.14,15 To achieve high-performance perovskite solar cells, the most important factor is learning how to fabricate a pure α-phase perovskite structure without impurities, such as residual PbI2 or the δ-phase non-perovskite structure.
Many approaches have been attempted to produce the α-phase perovskite structure. The α-phase perovskite structure can be formed by controlling the deposition method,16 humidity conditions,17 annealing conditions,18,19 processing additives,20 and surface passivation.21 Recently, to form pure α-phase perovskite structures, additives were incorporated into the perovskite precursor solution. Various additives including metal halide salts,22–25 organic halide salts,26–30 inorganic acids,31–34 and others35–37 have been used to grow α-phase dominant perovskite structures, resulting in high performance devices. However, adding chloride ions was not successful, and resulted in relatively low stability and efficiency, compared to other additives.38–40
Recently, we found that the addition of MACl improved the properties of FAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) because the MACl successfully induced the formation of an intermediate phase. The results showed that cationic chlorides were effective additives for FAPbI3-based PeSCs.41 Besides, the addition of various cationic chlorides such as FACl,42 MACl,42,43 and MDACl244 for FAPbI3-based PeSCs has also been reported.
Wang et al. studied adding FACl and MACl in equal molar amount to a FAPbI3 solution. They demonstrated that the additives were effective at improving the crystallinity of α-FAPbI3via the formation of intermediate mixtures, which suppressed crystallization of the δ-phase FAPbI3.42 Mu et al. reported that MACl was a “stabilizer” when making black perovskite.43 Min et al. stabilized the α-FAPbI3 phase by doping with MDACl2.44
Nevertheless, the studies reported so far only investigated the effect of individual cationic chlorides. Research on the roles of various cationic chlorides has not yet been systematically reported. In particular, the effects of cationic chloride additives have not been systemically investigated in terms of cation size and the concentration of the additives.
In this paper, various cationic chlorides such as guanidinium chloride (GuCl), formamidinium chloride (FACl), cesium chloride (CsCl), rubidium chloride (RbCl), and potassium chloride (KCl) were added to a perovskite precursor. The film properties and device performances were explored as a function of the size of the cations (the ionic radii of Gu+, FA+, Cs+, Rb+, and K+ are 278 pm, 253 pm, 167 pm, 152 pm, and 133 pm, respectively). The important findings are that the size of the cations in the cationic chlorides strongly affected the morphology, crystallinity, optical absorption, photoluminescence, and J–V curve characteristics of the perovskite films and devices. The effect of cation size in the cationic chlorides on the stability of the α-phase mixed-cation perovskite structure and its relationship with solar cell performance was theoretically revealed through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Experimental methods
Materials
Fluorine-doped tin oxide on glass (7 Ω sq−1) was purchased from Asahi. TiO2 paste (SC-HT040) was purchased from ShareChem. Formamidine acetate salt (99%), hydriodic acid (HI, 57 wt% in water), titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous 99.8%), 2-propanol (anhydrous, 99.5%), chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%), N′-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, >99.5%), guanidinium chloride (GuCl, >99%), cesium chloride (CsCl, >99.999%), and rubidium chloride (RbCl, >99.5%) were procured from Sigma Aldrich. Lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9985%) was obtained from TCI. Formamidinium chloride (FACl) was purchased from GreatCell Solar. Ethanol (absolute, 99.9%) was purchased from Changshu Yangyuan Chemicals. Diethyl ether (extra pure grade) was procured from Duksan.
Materials synthesis
Formamidinium iodide (FAI) was synthesized as reported before.56 Briefly, 25 g formamidine acetate was directly mixed with 50 mL hydriodic acid in a 500 mL round-bottomed flask with vigorous stirring. A yellow powder was obtained by evaporating the solvent at 80 °C for 1 hour. The resulting powder was dissolved in ethanol and precipitated using diethyl ether. This procedure was repeated until a white powder was obtained, and the powder was recrystallized from ethanol and diethyl ether in a refrigerator. After recrystallization, the powder was dried at 60 °C for 24 h. Single-crystal FAPbI3 was fabricated as reported previously.57,58 A 0.8 M solution of PbI2/FAI was dissolved in γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and filtered using a PVDF filter with a 0.2 μm pore size. The resulting solution was placed in a vial and incubated in an oil bath undisturbed at 110 °C for 2 h. The resulting material was filtered using a glass filter and dried at 60 °C for 24 h.
Device fabrication
A fluorine-doped tin oxide coated glass substrate (FTO glass, sheet resistance of 7 Ω sq−1) with a thickness of 1.8 mm was used as the substrate for the devices. The substrates were cleaned sequentially with H2O2–HCl–H2O, acetone, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic cleaner for 10 min.59 A compact TiO2 layer was deposited on top of the FTO glass using the spray pyrolysis method. To deposit the compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer, 80 mL of a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate)/ethanol (1:10 v/v) solution was applied by spraying. Prior to spraying, the substrates were placed on a 450 °C hot plate. After spray pyrolysis, the FTO/c-TiO2 substrate was allowed to heat to 450 °C for 1 hour.60 Mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) was deposited by spin-coating the diluted solution of TiO2 paste. The ratio of TiO2 paste to the ethanol/terpineol mixed solvent was 1:5. The FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2 substrates were heated at 500 °C on a hot plate for 1 h to remove organic compounds and then slowly cooled to 200 °C. The substrates were immediately submitted to plasma cleaning for 10 min prior to perovskite deposition.
Precursor solutions with varying concentrations of GuCl, FACl, CsCl, RbCl, and KCl were used as the perovskite precursors. The cationic chlorides were prepared at concentrations of 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol%, 40 mol%, and 50 mol%. To fabricate perovskite solar cells based on FAPbI3, the perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1234 mg of FAPbI3 in 1 mL of a mixed solution of DMF and DMSO (DMF:DMSO = 4:1 (v/v)). Each of GuCl, FACl, CsCl, RbCl, and KCl was added to the solution in various mole ratios to obtain FAPbI3 with a concentration range of 0–50 mol%. For each sample, 70 μL of the solution was spread over the FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2 substrate at 8000 rpm for 50 s with 0.1 s ramping. During the spin-coating, 1 mL diethyl ether was dripped after spinning for 10 seconds using a pipette. The annealing temperature was experimentally varied but annealing at 150 °C for 10 min was found to be optimal for obtaining the highest efficiency devices with our system. After that, the substrates were spin-coated with phenylammonium iodide (PEAI) which was dissolved with IPA (10 mM) at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The hole transfer materials were deposited by preparing spiro-OMeTAD in chlorobenzene (90 mg mL−1), and mixing with 35 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), 26 μL of Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (520 mg mL−1 acetonitrile), and 10 μL tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (180 mg mL−1 acetonitrile). The mixed spiro-OMeTAD solution was spin coated on the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a gold electrode was thermally evaporated on the hole transport layer using a shadow mask.
Characterization
The performance of the solar cells was measured using a solar simulator (McScience, K3000 Lab solar cell J–V measurement system, Class AAA) at 100 mA cm−2, with AM 1.5 G illumination. The light intensity was calibrated using a Si-reference cell certified by NREL before taking measurements. The cells were masked using a metal mask in order to limit the active cell area to 0.0804 cm2. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were obtained using a QEX7 system (PV Measurement, Inc.). The phases of the perovskite films were measured by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) using a D8 Advance (Bruker) diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). The morphologies of the perovskite films were assessed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4800, Hitachi). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) and steady-state photoluminescence measurements were conducted using a PicoQuantFluoTime 300 (PicoQuant GmbH, Germany) equipped with a PDL 820 laser pulse driver. A pulsed laser diode (λ = 375 nm, pulse FWHM (full width at half maximum) < 70 ps, repetition rate 200 kHz to 40 MHz) was used to excite the sample. The absorption spectra of the perovskite layers were measured using UV-vis spectrometry with a UV-2600 (Shimadzu). X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected using a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB250XI at a base pressure of 1.0 × 10−9 Torr using a monochromic Al-Kα X-ray source.
Computational details
In this study, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to investigate how the size of the cations (i.e., Gu+, FA+, Cs+, Rb+, and K+ cations) in the cationic chlorides affected the stability of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure. All DFT calculations were performed with the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) program.61,62 A generalized gradient approximation with a Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) functional63 was used for the electronic exchange–correlation potential. A norm-conserving pseudopotential64 was used for the interactions of electron and ion cores. The Tkatchenko and Scheffler (TS) method65 was used to apply the van der Waals interactions. All calculations were performed with spin polarization. A plane wave basis set with an energy cut-off of 700 eV was applied. The self-consistent field tolerance was 1 × 10−6 eV per atom. The convergence criteria for the geometry optimization were 0.03 eV Å−1 for the maximum force, 0.05 GPa for the maximum stress, 1 × 10−5 eV per atom for the maximum energy change, and 1 × 10−3 Å for the maximum displacement. For the cell optimization of the α-phase perovskite structure, the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm66 was applied. The Brillouin zone was used with a 1 × 1 × 3 k-point set with the Monkhorst–Pack scheme.67 Moreover, a 2 × 2 × 6 k-point set was used for projected density of states (PDOS) calculation.
Results and discussion
Device performance
To investigate the effect of the mixed-cations from cationic chlorides with various cationic sizes on the characteristics of perovskite solar cells (PeSCs), we measured the J–V characteristics of the PeSCs fabricated with GuCl, FACl, CsCl, RbCl, and KCl. To clearly isolate the effects resulting from the difference in cation size of the cationic chlorides, the optimum concentration of each cationic chloride was investigated. Fig. 1 and Table 1 show the measured efficiencies of solar cells with added GuCl, FACl, CsCl, RbCl, and KCl at concentrations of 10 mol%, 20 mol%, 30 mol%, 40 mol%, and 50 mol% (denoted as Gu-x, FA-x, Cs-x, Rb-x, and K-x, x = 10–50), respectively. The full set of EQE data and integrated Jsc are shown in Fig. S1.† As shown in Fig. S1,† the integrated Jsc obtained from the EQE measurement is consistent with the Jsc of the J–V curve. The cell performance varied greatly depending on the type and concentration of the cationic chloride.

Interestingly, the trends in the J–V characteristics of PeSCs were strongly correlated with the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) (eqn (S3)†). The tolerance factor is calculated from the ionic radius. It is generally well known that a stable cubic perovskite structure is formed when the tolerance factor has a value of 0.9 < t < 1.4. The ionic radii of Gu+, FA+, Cs+, Rb+, and K+ are 278 pm, 253 pm, 167 pm, 152 pm, and 133 pm, respectively. The tolerance factors of all samples fabricated in the presence of the cationic chlorides are listed in Table S2.† The addition of GuCl (Gu+: 278 pm) with a cationic radius larger than that of the FA ion (FA+: 253 pm) resulted in lower performance than that of the pristine device at all addition concentrations (Fig. 1(a)). We conclude that the exceptionally large tolerance factor value (t > 1) of GuCl has negative effects on the efficiency of the devices. In addition, it is widely known that guanidinium (Gu+) is the only reported cation that can form the alternating cation in the interlayer space type.68 On the other hand, for FACl (t = 1.007) and CsCl (0.911 < t < 0.988), the tolerance factor value was stable. The performance of the devices prepared with FACl improved to an efficiency of 22.56% (FA-30) and then decreased to 16.66% (FA-50) at higher concentrations (Fig. 1(b)). The addition of CsCl gave the highest efficiency of 23.28% with Cs-20 (Fig. 1(c)). The solar cells optimized with Cs-20 achieved a certified efficiency of 22.65% (Fig. S2 and Table S1†) and improved storage stability (Fig. S3†). With the addition of RbCl (Rb+: 152 pm) and KCl (K+: 133 pm), the device efficiency was lower than that of the pristine device under all concentration conditions (Fig. 1(d) and (e)).
The tolerance factor also ranged between 0.9 and 1. However, the results indicate that when the tolerance factor, t, was too large or too small, the efficiency was lower than that of the pristine device regardless of the concentration of the cationic chloride. However, when the tolerance factor was appropriate, each cationic chloride was found to have optimum concentration conditions. As shown in Fig. 1(f), the best performances were obtained with Gu-10, FA-30, Cs-20, Rb-10, and K-10. These results indicate that both the concentration and the cationic size of the cationic chlorides forming the mixed-cations have a large influence on device characteristics. These results were further explained with DFT calculation.
Crystallographic properties
To determine how different cationic sizes and concentrations of cationic chlorides affect the crystallinity of the perovskite films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted. The full set of diffraction results obtained from perovskite films prepared with GuCl, FACl, CsCl, RbCl, and KCl at concentrations of 0–50 mol% are shown in Fig. 2. Interestingly, there was a close relationship between the crystallinity of the perovskite films and the cationic size of the cationic chlorides. The non-perovskite δ-phase peak (11.6°) and PbI2 peak (12.7°)45,46 were found for all GuCl concentrations, with a very large tolerance factor (Fig. 2(a)). When the concentration of FACl was controlled, the PbI2 peak disappeared and the non-perovskite phase decreased (Fig. 2(b)). In the case of CsCl, the non-perovskite phase and the PbI2 peak completely disappeared and only a pure α-phase perovskite peak was present as shown in Fig. 2(c). However, RbCl and KCl with a very small tolerance factor value also showed lower crystallinity than the pristine films at all concentrations (Fig. 2(d) and (e)). Fig. 2(f) shows the XRD spectra of the best conditions for each cationic chloride: Gu-10, FA-30, Cs-20, Rb-10, and K-10.

The crystallinities of the films were compared by plotting the reciprocal value of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) obtained as shown in Fig. S4† from the XRD spectrum (Fig. 2(f)). The (110) diffraction peaks were somewhat broader for Gu-10, Rb-10, and K-10 than for the pristine film, indicating smaller crystallinities. The narrower (110) peaks were comparable to those of the pristine film observed for FA-30 and Cs-20 films. Fig. 2 and S4† indicate that the purity and crystallinity of the perovskite films were influenced by cation size and the concentration of the cationic chloride.
The results shown in Fig. 2 agree with the trends in device efficiency shown in Fig. 1(a)–(e). Based on these trends, it can be deduced that the difference in device efficiencies produced by controlling the cationic size and concentration of the cationic chlorides is due to the change in the crystallinity of the perovskite films. This result suggests that the crystallinity decreased when the cation size of the cationic chlorides became too large or too small, which is consistent with the tolerance factor range that forms the perovskite structure mentioned above. This trend is also in agreement with the J–V curve results, as shown in Fig. 1. It can be that the higher Voc and FF of the FA-30 and Cs-20 added devices are due to the suppression of PbI2 and the non-perovskite J–V δ-phase when cationic chlorides with appropriate cation size and concentration are added.
These XRD measurements show that the size of the cations of the cationic chlorides significantly influences the crystallinity of the perovskite films, even at the optimized concentrations. Furthermore, adding cationic chlorides with cations whose size is in the suitable t value range can improve the crystallinity of perovskite films, and the crystallinity's impact on the efficiency of solar cells.
SEM morphology
A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed to measure and compare the films' surface morphology as a function of the cationic size and concentration. The full set of images of perovskite films with GuCl, FACl, CsCl, RbCl, and KCl are presented in Fig. 3 and S5–S8.† The grain size observed for the GuCl addition was somewhat indeterminate because the grain boundary regions could not be clearly distinguished (Fig. S5†). This uncertain grain boundary can be deduced from the XRD results of previous measurements, in which the non-perovskite δ-phase was increased in the film by the large cationic size of the Gu+ ion, and thus the multi-phase was formed.
 Fig. 3  Top view SEM images of perovskite films prepared with different concentrations of CsCl: (a) pristine, (b) Cs-10, (c) Cs-20, (d) Cs-30, (e) Cs-40, and (f) Cs-50, and (g) grain size distribution. Note that the scale bar is 1 μm. 
The grain size obtained with the pristine film was approximately 250 nm (Fig. 3). Among these cationic chlorides, especially the grain boundary greatly increased when CsCl was added. The grain size of the perovskite film with Cs-20 was around 610 nm (Fig. 3(c)). The grain size distribution relative to the size of the cation is shown in Fig. 3(g). These results indicate that the size and concentration of the cation in the cationic chloride highly influenced the perovskite structure, and these results are consistent with the J–V characteristics and XRD peaks.
For GuCl, RbCl, and KCl with cationic sizes that were too large or small, many non-perovskite δ-phase and PbI2 impurities occurred in the perovskite film, leading to small grain sizes. For FACl and CsCl, however, the pure perovskite α-phase was dominant in the perovskite film and resulted in the formation of large grains. Large grain size resulted in higher efficiency. These results suggest that cationic chlorides with the appropriate cationic size can have a large effect on the grain size of the film by forming pure perovskite structures, consequently affecting device characteristics.
Photoluminescence properties
To investigate the effect of cation size on the carrier lifetime of perovskite films, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay profiles were obtained from perovskite films prepared by adding cationic chlorides with different ion sizes. As shown in Fig. 4, the PL decay curves, measured at the peak emission (780 nm), showed bi-exponential decays with a fast (τ1) and a slow component (τ2). The τ1 decay component corresponded to non-radiative recombination from defects (surface traps near the grain boundaries), and the τ2 component corresponded to radiative recombination from the bulk perovskite.47,48 The full set of decay curves are presented in Fig. 4, and the calculated τ1 and τ2 values are listed in Table S3.† The pristine film showed τ1 of 509 ns and τ2 of 262 ns. The addition of GuCl decreased the values of τ1 and τ2. These results can be deduced given the many PbI2 or non-perovskite δ-phase regions in the perovskite film, as shown in the XRD measurements (Fig. 2(a)). FA-30 and Cs-20, respectively, showed lifetimes of 594 ns (τ1) and 248 ns (τ2), and 1275 ns (τ1) and 623 ns (τ2), which are longer carrier lifetimes than in the pristine cases. The long carrier lifetimes result from the larger grain size, as shown in Fig. 3. Rb-10 and K-10 had shorter lifetimes of 510 ns (τ1) and 224 ns (τ2), and 411 ns (τ1) and 126 ns (τ2). It is well known that the Voc of PeSCs depends on the recombination rate in the perovskite film.49,50 These results show that differences in the crystallinity and grain size due to the cation size of the cationic chlorides will affect the carrier lifetime. Consequently, carrier lifetime was greatly improved when the cationic chlorides had the appropriate cation size in terms of tolerance factor as shown in Table S3.†

(f) TRPL results for the best concentration conditions for Gu-10, FA-30, Cs-20, Rb-10, and K-10. 
Steady-state PL measurements were collected from the perovskite films deposited on glass. The corresponding curves for the PL peaks of all compositions are shown in Fig. S9.† The intensities of the PL peaks gradually increased with FACl and CsCl concentration, and a slight blue shift was observed in the emission peak compared to the pristine case. The highest PL intensities were found in FA-30 and Cs-20, indicating a high crystal quality, in agreement with the XRD results. These results indicate that the higher Voc obtained with FA-30 and Cs-20 (Fig. 1(f)) is due to longer lifetime and a strong PL intensity, as shown in Fig. 4 and S9,† compared to the pristine films.
Elementary analysis
To confirm that the cationic chloride was replaced by the perovskite structure, perovskite films fabricated using different concentrations of cationic chloride were characterized elementally using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Fig. 5. The analysis was conducted on films prepared with CsCl additions because it was easy to check the ratio of Cs to Cl content. Fig. 5(a) shows the atomic ratio of Cs in each film. The intensity of the Cs peak increased with the CsCl content, indicating that the cationic ions substituted the cationic sites effectively. Furthermore, the N ratio of FAPbI3 perovskite film decreased with increasing CsCl content because the Cs ions were incorporated into the cationic sites (Fig. 5(b)). In contrast to the Cs ion, the Cl ion was not substituted into the anionic sites.

Some studies have shown that the addition of chloride ions to a perovskite does not facilitate the formation of a continuous perovskite phase because the chloride ions readily evaporated away during the annealing process.41,43,51 To evaluate the Cl content, XPS measurements of the Cl ions were conducted as a function of CsCl concentration, from Cs-10 to Cs-50. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the signal corresponding to Cl content in the film was not detected in all samples. These results indicate that the chloride ion had evaporated during annealing. CsCl easily decomposed into Cs+ and Cl− which was easily removed from the film through evaporation with annealing. The intensities of the Pb and I ion signals did not change significantly, indicating that the cationic chloride also induced a high purity perovskite structure as shown in Fig. 5(d) and (e). The disappearance of Cl ions during annealing has been observed by others.43 These results suggest that the perovskite film fabricated with cationic chloride featured cationic ion substitutions in cationic sites, and chloride ions were not extensively present at detectable levels, except during the un-annealed stage.
Computational study of the size effect of cations in cationic chlorides
To understand the effect of cation size on the crystallinity of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, a density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed (Computational details in the Experimental methods). In our previous study, we found that the Cl ion stabilized the α-phase perovskite structure by enhancing the interaction between FA and I in the cubo-octahedral structure, which consisted of Pb and I in the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite.41 Like our previous study, the results of formation energy showed that the Cl ion played the same role, which was the stabilization of the perovskite structure regardless of cation type (Fig. 6(a)). Note that the formation energy of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure, including the cationic chloride or cation, was calculated based on the model systems in Fig. S10 and S11.† In particular, Cl effectively stabilized the Gu-incorporated structure, even though its Goldschmidt tolerance factor was higher due to the larger size of Gu compared to other cations. Moreover, it showed the most stable formation energy.
 Fig. 6  (a) Formation energies of α-phase FAPbI3 perovskites including five types of cationic chloride (i.e., GuCl, FACl, CsCl, RbCl and KCl) or four types of cation (i.e., FA, Cs, Rb and K). Note that Gu and FA cations can have hydrogen bonding with the halogen atoms (i.e., Cl and I) of the cubo-octahedral site composed of Pb and I in the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure. (b) Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure including Cs, Rb or K cation. Note that the isosurface value of the HOMO is 0.01 e Å−3. (c) Volume differences of cubo-octahedral sites of the perovskite structure including the Rb or K cation compared to the FA-incorporated system of Fig. S15.† 
However, when the Cl ion was replaced by an I ion, the Gu-incorporated structure was deformed from the α-phase structure (Fig. S12(a)†). We estimated that the deformed structure was the reason why the PeSCs treated with the GuCl had the lowest efficiency. On the other hand, other cationic chlorides effectively maintained the α-phase perovskite structure even after replacing Cl with I (Fig. S12(b)†). We found that the order of their formation energies was very consistent with the order of solar cell performance (i.e., CsCl > FACl > RbCl > KCl). Importantly, although they had a suitable Goldschmidt tolerance factor for an α-phase structure (i.e., 0.9 < t < 1), the Rb and K cations showed much higher formation energies compared to the Cs and FA cations, which was quite consistent with the order of solar cell performance (Fig. 6(a)). To understand why the formation energy of the Rb- or K-incorporated system was higher, we calculated the electronic properties (i.e., projected density of states (PDOS) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)). The PDOS results showed that the incorporation of a Rb or K cation enhanced the intensity of the p orbital of I in the perovskite structure, compared to the FA cation, but their intensities were similar to those with the Cs cation (Fig. S13†). This indicates that the change in the p orbital intensity of I induced by the Rb or K cation is not the factor which reduces the stability of the perovskite structure. However, the HOMO distributions produced important results. In Fig. 6(b), unlike the Cs-incorporated system, the p orbitals of I were more enhanced in the position of the Rb or K cation. This phenomenon was especially noticeable in the K-incorporated system. This indicates that the interaction between FA and I is reduced by the redistribution of the p orbital of I to the Rb or K cation. Unlike the FA cation, Rb and K cations cannot form hydrogen bonds with I in the cubo-octahedral structure. This reduces the stability of the α-phase perovskite structure. Note that the FA cation does form hydrogen bonds between the H of the NH bond in the FA cation and the I of the cubo-octahedral structure in the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure.52–54
Next, the change in the local volume of the cubo-octahedral structure of the cation incorporated perovskite structure was another factor which affected the stability of the perovskite structure. The total volume of the structure was decreased by decreasing the size of the cation (Fig. S14†). This occurred because of the volume shrinkage of the cubo-octahedral structure of the cation incorporated site, which could not induce the formation of hydrogen bonds with I (Fig. S15†). The left (site 4) and right (site 6) cubo-octahedral volumes of the cation incorporated sites increased, while decreasing the size of cations, compared to the FA-incorporated system (Fig. 6(c)). This indicates that the stability of the perovskite structure can be reduced by reducing the interaction between FA and I in the cubo-octahedral structure. On the other hand, for the Cs-incorporated system, because the local volume expansion of these sites was smaller, while the volume of other sites shrank, the stability of the perovskite structure was relatively enhanced compared to K and Rb cations (Fig. 6(c) and S16†). Moreover, compared to the FA cation, the stability of the α-phase perovskite structure was enhanced due to the increase in interaction between the FA and I, induced by the shrinkage of the total volume of the Cs-incorporated system, which was consistent with a previous report.55
We further investigated the effect of concentration of FACl and CsCl, to elucidate why the CsCl increased the performance of the solar cell at a lower concentration compared to the FACl. For this investigation, we calculated the formation energy of the α-phase perovskite structure including the FACl or CsCl, and the doping formation energy of the FACl or CsCl into the α-phase perovskite. This was based on the modeled systems for the perovskite structure, including each cationic chloride for various doping concentrations (Fig. S17–S19†). We found that the higher doping formation energy of the CsCl influenced its optimal concentration, which was a lower concentration (i.e., 20 mol%) compared to that of the FACl (Fig. S20†).
Overall, we have presented the effects of five types of cationic chloride (i.e., GuCl, FACl, CsCl, RbCl and KCl) on the formation of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure. Notably, we found that the size of the cations affected the stability of the perovskite structure. Due to the large size of the Gu cation, the perovskite structure could not be maintained without the aid of the Cl ion. Moreover, for the alkali metal cations, as the size of the cation decreased, the structural stability decreased, due to the localization of the p orbital of I to the alkali metal cation, and the local volume expansion of the cubo-octahedral site of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure.
Conclusions
In this study, how the cation size and concentration of cationic chlorides affected mixed-cation PeSCs was investigated using GuCl, FACl, CsCl, RbCl, and KCl. By optimizing the concentration conditions to obtain the best performance for each type of cationic chloride, the effects of just cationic size could be clearly compared.
It was found that the cationic size of the cationic chlorides greatly influenced the device characteristics. Efficiency was improved by up to 23.28% (certified as 22.65%) by using mixed-cations formed by cationic chlorides with an appropriate cation size. Cation size, which satisfies the range of tolerance factor to form a stable perovskite structure, can improve crystallinity by forming a pure perovskite structure. This was achieved only with FACl and CsCl. The grain size increased 2.50 times and the carrier lifetime improved by 2.44 times.
The mechanisms which allowed cationic chlorides to produce high crystallinity and good performance were investigated using DFT calculations. It was determined that the size of the cation affected the stability of the perovskite structure by changing the p orbital distribution of I, and the local volume of the cubo-octahedral site of the α-phase FAPbI3 perovskite structure.
The present work illustrates the effects of various cationic chlorides, and their value in high-efficiency devices. The mechanism by which certain concentrations of cationic chlorides improved perovskite crystallinity and increased device efficiency is not fully understood, but our results demonstrated the versatility of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites for use in future research.
