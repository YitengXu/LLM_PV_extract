    , Accepted 2nd August 2017First published on 3rd August 2017AbstractDeveloping electron-donating building blocks for organic semiconductors is still one big chemical challenge to achieve high performance active materials for organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In this work, we have successfully designed and synthesized a novel ladder-type nonacyclic indacenodithieno[3,2-b]indole (IDTI) unit via intramolecular annulation with rigid and coplanar features. Two donor–acceptor copolymers of PIDTI-BT and PIDTI-DTBT were synthesized by utilizing the Suzuki and Stille coupling polymerization method with IDTI units. Both copolymers displayed excellent solubility, high thermal stability, broad absorption and a low band gap. The FET hole mobility reaches 2.1 × 10−2 and 1.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PIDTI-BT and PIDTI-DTBT, respectively. The conventional bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cell (PSC) devices based on the PIDTI-BT:PC71BM (1:2 in wt%) blend exhibit a moderate PCE of 4.02% with a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 8.99 mA cm−2 and a FF of 54.6% under AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 illumination, which is among the highest values for polymer donor materials based on multifused TI units. The improved performance may be associated with the extended conjugation length, which optimizes the interchain interactions and improves molecular organization for accelerating charge transport. Our results demonstrate that the multifused nonacyclic TIBDP as the donor unit is very promising for application in PSCs and FETs.
Introduction
Conjugated polymers have received significant scientific and industrial attention in polymeric field-effect transistors (PFETs) and polymer solar cells (PSCs) owing to their unique advantages such as solution processability, low cost, large-scale production, and good flexibility, which provide opportunities in the production of flexible electronics.1–9 The acenedithiophene (AcDT) family in which polyaromatic benzene rings are fused with two terminal thiophene rings are particularly attractive and promising building blocks.10,11 The rigid and coplanar entity of AcDT is conducive to π-electron delocalization and induces strong π–π stacking, leading to efficient charge transport. In addition, various flexible alkyl chains can be introduced into the AcDT family for increasing the solubility of the resulting polymer. The α-positions of the two terminal thiophene units could be easily functionalized and are conducive to the precise cross-coupling reaction. More importantly, the molecular shape, size, and length of the AcDT system could be chemically manipulated or modified for tuning the electronic and steric properties. Typically, the tricyclic benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit, a central benzene ring fused with two thiophenes, represents one of the most attractive and successful building blocks for constructing low-band gap polymers and achieving highly efficient OFETs and PSCs.9,12–16 A pentacyclic dithieno[2,3-d;2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT), an extended derivative of BDT, was also reported by Sun et al.17 Compared to BDT, DTBDT can effectively improve the charge carrier transport due to the extension of π-conjugation. Its D–A conjugated polymer PDBT-T1 as the donor material showed excellent photovoltaic device performance in the application of fullerene and non-fullerene organic solar cells.17–20 The pentacyclic indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit was also a successful building block for PSCs and OFETs owing to its extended conjugation and coplanarity.21–25 In order to obtain longer conjugation lengths and more rigid structures in π-conjugated polymers, the heptacyclic-, nonacyclic- and eleven-ring compounds based on the pentacyclic IDT unit and their D–A copolymers were reported by Hsu and Jen individually, and successfully applied to PSCs.26–30 Recently, some AcDT units, for example, BDT or IDT and their derivatives have been introduced as the non-fullerene acceptor material to design oligomeric small molecules with the A–D–A structure and produced high device performance.19,31–34 These findings proved that more applications of the active materials can be explored via the design of ladder-type building blocks.
Tricyclic thieno[3,2-b]indole (TI) formed by merging a dithienopyrrole (DTP) unit and a carbazole unit appears to be an attractive electron-rich building block to build D–A conjugated polymers.35,36 In particular, by using the D–A copolymer, 4-(2-decyltetradecyl)-2-methyl-6-(5-(7-methylbenzo[c][1,2,5]thia-diazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (PTITBT) as the donor material and PC71BM as the acceptor, a pronounced PCE of about 5.9% was achieved.35 Additionally, the extended-TI of pentacyclic benzodipyrrolothiophene (BDPT) has emerged as an electron-rich building block for conjugated polymers used in OFETs and OPVs.37 For instance, Donaghey and Cheng reported the D–A conjugated polymers PBDPTBT (Fig. 1) containing the pentacyclic BDPT as the donor unit and BT as the acceptor unit; the BHJ PSCs from the PBDPTBT/PC71BM (1:3, w/w) blend afforded a PCE of 3.08% with a FET hole mobility of 0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1. The heptatomic dithienopyrrolo-carbazole (DTPC), a more extended TI unit, was developed by Hsu's group to furnish the copolymer PDTPCBT (see Fig. 1).38PDTPCBT displayed a low band gap of 1.50 eV and a relatively high HOMO energy level of −4.76 eV. The device based on the PDTPCBT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) blend displayed a PCE of 2.6% with a low Voc of 0.5 V and a FET hole mobility of 6.1–8.5 × cm2 V−1 s−1. Triggered by the above successes, considerable attention should be paid to further elongating the conjugation length of the TI system.

Our group is particularly interested in the design and synthesis of heteroatom-fused molecules.39–43 Inspired by our previous work, a novel multifused nonacyclic indacenodithieno[3,2-b]indole (IDTI) unit has been successfully developed by replacement of the thiophene-ring of the known indacenodithiophene (IDT) unit. A large branched 2-decyltetradecyl (C24) was readily introduced into the IDTI unit to guarantee good solubility. Besides, we attached 4-(octyloxy)benzene substituents on the multifused nonacyclic IDTI unit in order to avoid the strong molecular stacking existing in the multifused cyclic structures. Two D–A conjugated polymers, PIDTI-BT and PIDTI-DTBT, were designed and synthesized via the Pd-catalyzed Suzuki or Stille coupling polymerization by using the IDTI unit as the donor unit and benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) or 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzothiadiazole (DTBT) as the acceptor unit. Both the copolymers showed excellent solubility in common organic solvents (such as toluene, chloroform and tetrahydrofuran, etc.). The thermal, optical and electrochemical properties of the resulting copolymers were systematically studied. The high organic field-effect transistor (OFET) hole mobilities with these two copolymers as the semiconducting layer with bottom-gate/top-contact geometry were determined to be ∼10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is beneficial for charge transportation in BHJ PSCs. Upon the thermal annealing treatment (130 °C for 10 min), the BHJ PSC devices based on PIDTI-DTBT as the donor material and PC71BM as the acceptor material exhibited a decent PCE of 3.72%, with a Jsc of 9.07 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.80 V and a FF of 51.4%. Encouragingly, the devices based on PIDTI-BT/PC71BM (1:2, w/w) as the active layer achieved a better PCE of 4.02% under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination, the PCE of PTIBDP-BT is 31% higher than that of PDTPCBT- and 55% higher than that of the PBDPTBT-based BHJ PSC device, which is among the highest values in the current reports based on the multifused TI-polymers.37,38 The improved performance may be associated with the extended conjugation length, which optimizes the interchain interactions and improves molecular organization for accelerating charge transportation among the active layer. These results demonstrated that nonacyclic IDTI could be a promising donor unit for constructing active materials to find applications in OPVs and OFETs.
Experimental section
Materials
PdCl2(dppf), Pd(PPh3)4, Pd2(dba)3, P(o-toly)3, anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 4,7-bis(5-(trimethyl-stannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole, 4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) were purchased from Energy Chemical, J&K and Suna Tech Inc (China). Toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were freshly distilled prior to use after being refluxed with Na and benzophenone. All other reagents were used directly without any treatment.
Measurements and general methods

1H NMR and 13C NMR data were recorded using a Bruker Ultra Shield Plus AV400 spectrometer in deuterated chloroform solution at 298 K with tetramethylsilane (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) as the internal standard (1H NMR: 400 MHz, 13C NMR: 100 MHz). Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectra (MALDI-TOF MS) were measured utilizing a Shimadzu AXIMA-CFR mass spectrometer. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of the polymers and polydispersity index (PDI) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with polystyrene as standard and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) (HPLC grade) as the eluent. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere were performed on a Rigaku TG-DTA 8120 thermal analyzer and a Mettler DSC823e thermal analyzer, correspondingly. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution with a Au disk as the working electrode, a Pt plate as the counter electrode and Ag/AgNO3 as the reference electrode. The surface morphology was measured using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Thermo. Auto Probe C P Res.).
OFET device fabrication and characterization
Bottom-gate/top-contact organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) with the configuration of n++Si/SiO2/polymer/Au–Au were fabricated. A heavily doped n-type Si wafer with 300 nm SiO2 (a capacitance of 11 nF cm−2) was used as the substrate. The thin films of polymers PIDTI-BT and PIDTI-DTBT were prepared by spin-coating a 5 mg mL−1o-DCB solution onto a SiO2/Si substrate and annealing at 130 °C for 10 min under a nitrogen atmosphere. The gold source and drain electrodes were deposited by vacuum evaporation on the active layers. Source and drain electrodes with the channel width W = 2000 μm and length L = 100 μm were formed after Au was thermally evaporated through a shadow mask. The FET hole mobility was calculated from the equation IDS = (μWCi/2L)(Vg − Vt)2, where IDS is the drain-source current, μ is the FET mobility, W is the channel width, L is the channel length, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer, and VG is the gate voltage.
Solar cell device fabrication and characterization
The conventional BHJ PSCs with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al were fabricated through the following process. Firstly, patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were successively washed by ultrasonication in a neutral detergent, such as deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 10 min. Then the ITO substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min. Secondly, a thin film (40 nm in thickness) of hole-transporting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated onto ITO glass substrates from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution. The active layers were prepared by spin-coating the polymer/PC71BM blends in o-DCB (25 mg mL−1) onto the top of the PEDOT/PSS layer at 1000 (or 1500) rpm for 2 min. The spin-coated ITO glass was further annealed at 130 °C for 10 min. Finally, calcium (2 nm) and aluminum (200 nm thick) were evaporated onto the blend films through a shadow mask at pressures below 3 × 10−6 Torr to provide an active area of 0.11 cm2, which became a top cathode to complete the fabrication of the BHJ PSCs. The thickness of the active layer was measured using a Dektak 150 profilometer. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic power conversion efficiencies (PCE) were characterized using a computer-programmed Keithley 2420 sourcemeter and a Newport's Oriel class A solar simulator under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G irradiation. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the solar cells were analyzed by using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system. In addition, the hole mobilities of the polymers were also determined by using a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the same device geometry as the PSCs under the optimized conditions.

In a RBF (100 mL), 1-bromo-4-(octyloxy)benzene (1.43 g, 5 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (15 mL). The solution was cooled to −78 °C in a dry ice–acetone bath. n-Butyllithium (1.6 M, 3.2 mL, 5.1 mmol) was added dropwise to the solution in a N2 atmosphere. It was kept under stirring at −78 °C for another 0.5 h after the addition was complete. Then, a THF (15 mL) solution of compound 2 (1.2 g, 1 mmol) was slowly added to the above reaction mixture through a syringe in 10 min. The mixture was then warmed up to room temperature and allowed to stand overnight. The mixture was poured into ice water and extracted with DCM (100 mL). The combined organic fractions were washed with water and dried over Na2SO4. The solvents were removed under reduced vacuum. The crude product was used directly for the next step without any further purification acetic acid (20 mL) and concentrated H2SO4 (0.4 mL) were mixed with the crude product, then the reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C for 3 h.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route for the nonacyclic IDTI and polymers are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2, respectively. First, thieno[3,2-b]indole (TI) was synthesized in gram scale according to the procedure reported by us previously.35,36 4-(2-Decyltetradecyl)-6-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indole (1) was prepared with a yield of 73% with TI as the starting material. The most important intermediate, diethyl 2,5-bis(4-(2-decyltetradecyl)-4H-thieno[3,2-b]indol-6-yl)terephthalate (2), was obtained via a 2-fold Suzuki coupling reaction with compound 1 and diethyl 2,5-dibromoterephthalate as the starting materials. IDTI was synthesized via the acid-promoted intramolecular annulation step developed by Hsu and other groups with a moderate yield of 63%. After the bromination step with NBS at a ratio of 1:2.05 in THF solution, the yellowish solid of the monomer, IDTI-Br, was produced in a high yield (88%). The polymer PIDTI-BT with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst in toluene and PIDTI-DTBT with Pd2(dba)3 as the catalyst and P(o-tol)3 as the ligand were synthesized by Suzuki and Stille coupling polymerization,44 respectively. The purification of the targeted copolymers was conducted by a typical Soxhlet extraction step. Both resulting polymers possess excellent solubility in common solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and tetrahydrofuran. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of PIDTI-BT and PIDTI-DTBT were 26.9 and 76.9k, with PDIs of 1.72 and 1.59, correspondingly. The chemical structures of the monomer and copolymers were identified by 1H NMR as shown in Fig. S1–S6 (ESI†).

Thermal properties
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were executed to investigate the thermal properties of the two copolymers, as outlined in Fig. 2. The decomposition temperatures (Td) with 5% weight-loss for PIDTI-BT and PIDTI-DTBT were 377 °C and 396 °C, respectively. The excellent thermal stability is good enough for the fabrication processes of PSCs and other optoelectronic devices. In addition, thermally induced phase-transition behavior of the copolymers was investigated using DSC under a nitrogen atmosphere. However, neither the melting point (Tm) nor the glass transition temperature (Tg) between 60 and 350 °C was observed during both the heating and cooling process.

Optical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of the two copolymers were measured in both dilute chloroform solutions (Fig. 3a) and in spin-coated films (Fig. 3b) with the correlative optical parameters summarized in Table 1. It is clearly found that both copolymers exhibit two significant absorption bands from 350 nm to 800 nm in solution and in the solid state, which is a typical phenomenon for the D–A type copolymers. The shorter wavelength absorbance is ascribed to the localized π–π* transitions of the donor unit while the lower energy band comes from the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor units and the acceptor units among the polymer backbone. In the chloroform solution, the absorption maxima were located at 428/624 nm for PIDTI-BT and 450/589 nm for PIDTI-DTBT, respectively. An obvious red-shifted absorption band of the two copolymers was observed from the solution to the solid state, demonstrating that the stronger intermolecular interactions formed in the solid state led to higher structural organization and ordered packing.45 In contrast to PIDTI-BT, PIDTI-DTBT with two additional thiophene rings bridging the BT units and the IDTI units along the conjugated backbones showed a red-shifted short-wavelength absorption band but a blue-shifted absorption maximum and a broader absorption feature for the longer-wavelength band in both the solution and film states. By introducing a more electron-donating thiophene ring in PIDTI-DTBT, the conjugation length increased, which resulted in the red-shifted π–π* transition band. But the thiophene ring could diminish the ICT characteristic from the IDTI units to the BT units, and as a consequence, the absorption maximum at a longer wavelength band displayed a blue-shifted trend. The optical band-gaps (Eoptg) deduced from the absorption edges of the thin film spectra are 1.65 eV for PIDTI-BT and 1.66 eV for PIDTI-DTBT, respectively, which are beneficial to harvest more sunlight and helpful in increasing the Jsc of the relevant PSCs.46,47

Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to evaluate the electrochemical properties and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the conjugated polymers.48 The CV plots of the copolymer films on a glassy carbon electrode are shown in Fig. 4(a) and the detailed results are listed in Table 1. Both the copolymers revealed stable and reversible oxidation and reduction processes, which are the necessary prerequisite for p-type organic semiconductor materials. For PIDTI-BT and PIDTI-DTBT, the onset points of the reduction process were both about −1.05 V, corresponding to a LUMO energy level of about −3.75 eV. Such LUMO energy is very close to the LUMO level of PC71BM to provide a driving force for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transportation among the D–A blend interfaces. The HOMO energy levels of the two copolymers were −5.30 and −5.26 eV for PTIBDP-BT and PTIBDP-DTBT, respectively. Additionally, the deep HOMO levels can be critical to improving the oxidative stability and higher Voc in the BHJ PSCs.

Theoretical calculation
To gain more insight into the molecular architecture, the molecular orbital geometry and electron density distribution of the polymers, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. To simplify the calculation and save time, two repeating units of each polymer were chosen instead of the whole D–A polymer backbone and all the side chains were replaced by methyl to reduce the simulation time. As shown in Fig. 5, the HOMOs of the two copolymers were extensively delocalized, while the LUMOs were mainly located around the acceptor units. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels were −4.82/−2.93 eV for PIDTI-BT and −4.74/−2.84 eV for PIDTI-DTBT, correspondingly, which were in good agreement with the experimental results from the CV measurement. D1 is the dihedral angle between the donor unit and the acceptor unit, and D2 is the dihedral angle between the two repeating units of each polymer. All these dihedral angles of the two polymers are less than 4°, suggesting highly planar molecular structures, which affords more evidence for intrinsic π–π stacking and ICT from the donor units to the acceptor units in the polymer backbones. Thus, high mobilities could be expected.

Photovoltaic properties
BHJ PSCs with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al (as shown in Fig. 4(b)) were fabricated using PIDTI-BT and PIDTI-DTBT as the donor materials and PC71BM as the acceptor material. PC71BM was chosen as the acceptor material instead of PC61BM due to its considerably stronger absorption in the visible region, which can fully compensate the absorption valley of the donor material. The BHJ PSC active layer was prepared by spin-coating the polymer:PC71BM blend in their o-DCB solution on a PEDOT:PSS layer. To understand the role of the ratio between polymers and PC71BM on the photovoltaic performance of these polymer-based BHJ PSCs, devices with polymer:PC71BM weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4 were fabricated and measured. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm2 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices are shown in Fig. 7 and 8 and Table 2. With the increase of the D/A blend ratio, the thickness of the active layer may increase, hindering the charge transport to the electrode and thus affecting the device photovoltaic performance.49 For the two copolymers, the Jsc and the FF initially increased with the increase of the content of PC71BM in the active layer and reached the largest value at a blending ratio of 1:2 for PTIBDP-BT and 1:3 for PTIBDP-DTBT, and then the Jsc slightly decreased probably due to the reduction of the amount of the polymer donor material, resulting in the reduction of the light-harvesting capability of the active layer and also the unbalanced charge transporting abilities between holes and electrons. The Voc showed a similar value of about 0.80 V at all ratios (Table 2 and Fig. 8). After the thermal annealing treatment, the Jsc and FF of the device based on PIDTI-BT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) further increased from 8.28 mA cm−2 to 8.99 mA cm−2 and from 52.7% to 54.6%, respectively, resulting in the PCE reaching 4.02%. This value is 31% and 55% higher than the PCE values for devices based on PDTPCBT and PBDPTBT, respectively. Additionally, this value is among the highest values for PSCs based on copolymers using other multi-fused thienoindole units. This improved performance of IDTI-based D–A copolymers may be associated with the extended conjugation length to achieve enhanced interchain interactions and better molecular organization for accelerating charge transportation. Similarly, after the thermal annealing treatment, the PCE of the PIDTI-DTBT based devices increased to 3.72% owing to the enhancement of the Jsc and FF. It was found that the Jsc values for devices based on both of the polymers increased remarkably after thermal annealing treatment. We further investigated the UV-vis absorption spectra of the film cast from the polymer/PC71BM blends. As shown in Fig. 9, an obvious absorption intensity increase in the whole measured wavelength range was observed for both of the polymers. As it is well known that the light-harvesting capability of the active layer in a PSC device has a significant influence on its Jsc, we can speculate that the improved Jsc mainly depends on the enhancement of absorption (Fig. 9) after thermal annealing treatment. Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study the surface morphology of the active layers. The AFM phase images of the blend films are shown in Fig. 10. After the thermal annealing treatment, the surface of the active layer becomes smoother, indicating a better compatibility and film-forming ability between the polymers and PC71BM, which facilitates charge transport and thus improves the device performance.

The EQE curve of the two polymers covered a broad wavelength range from 300 to 800 nm with a maximum EQE value of ∼50%. The Jsc calculated from the integral of the EQE curves was 8.69 mA cm−2 for PTIBDP-BT:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) and 8.87 mA cm−2 for PTIBDP-DTBT:PC71BM (1:3, w/w), respectively, which was consistent with the Jsc value obtained from the J–V curves in Fig. 7(a), indicating that our photovoltaic measurement was accurate.
Organic field-effect transistor (OFET) measurement
Charge transport properties play an important role in the BHJ PSCs. To investigate the hole mobilities of the copolymers, bottom-gate/top-contact organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) with a structure of n++Si/SiO2/polymer/Au–Au were fabricated. The thin film was prepared by spin-coating a 5 mg mL−1o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) copolymer solution onto a SiO2/Si substrate, and annealing at 130 °C for 10 min under a N2 atmosphere. The output and transfer plots (at the same source–drain voltages of −30 V) of the devices are shown in Fig. 6 (without annealing treatment) and Fig. 6 (with annealing treatment). Obviously, the devices based on the two copolymers displayed the typical P-channel OFET characteristics. The hole mobilities obtained from the transfer characteristics of the devices were 3 × 10−3 for PTIBDP-BT and 5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTIBDP-DTBT, respectively. After the thermal annealing treatment at 130 °C for 10 min under a N2 atmosphere, the FET hole mobilities were improved to 2.1 × 10−2 and 1.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTIBDP-BT and PTIBDP-DTBT, correspondingly. This study demonstrates that the thermal annealing treatment is fundamental for IDTI-based polymers to induce stronger intermolecular stacking and more ordered organization and thus to enhance the hole mobility. We also measured the hole mobilities of the two blends films under their best PSC device conditions using the SCLC method (Fig. S8, ESI†). The PIDTI-BT:PC71BM blends exhibit a hole mobility of 1.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is slightly higher than that of the PIDTI-DTBT:PC71BM blends (8.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Moreover, the trend of FET mobilities was in good agreement with the efficiencies of the PSCs and the SCLC mobility of the polymer blends, suggesting that the intrinsic mobility of the polymers was one of the most important factors which determined the photovoltaic performance. Note that the hole FET mobilities of the nonacyclic IDTI and BT based D–A copolymers were slightly higher than those of the pentacyclic BDPT-based and heptacyclic DTPC-based D–A copolymers owing to the more extended π-conjugation system of nonacyclic IDTI. IDTI may generate better molecular organization and provide more efficient pathways for charge carrier transport.
Conclusions
In this work, we have successfully designed and synthesized a nonacyclic indacenodithieno[3,2-b]indole (IDTI) that consists of two asymmetric tricyclic building blocks of thieno[3,2-b]indoles (TI) fused with a benzodicyclopentadienyl ring. PIDTI-BT and PIDTI-DTBT copolymers incorporating this extended, rigidified and coplanar IDTI unit simultaneously possess excellent solubilities for solution-processability, low bandgaps with tuned HOMO/LUMO energy levels and high FET hole mobilities reaching 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. The preliminary solution-processed PSCs based on the PIDTI-BT:PC71BM (1:2 in wt%) blend exhibit a Voc of 0.82 V, a Jsc of 8.99 mA cm−2, and a FF of 54.6%, delivering a promising PCE of 4.02% under illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, which is among the best performances for polymer donor materials based on fused TI units. In addition, the FET mobilities are also among the highest values of all polymers based on ladder-type fused aromatics. These results indicated that the new nonacyclic donor unit IDTI was a good choice to build D–A conjugated polymers with a low band gap for BHJ PSCs. Higher PCEs by means of controlling the nanomorphology with other additives such as DMSO and improving the electric contacts could be expected in future exploration. Although the overall PCE by now is still not very high, the results reported here clearly indicate that the IDTI unit represents a rich opportunity for further rational molecular design of organic semiconductors for OPVs including non-fullerene acceptors50–53 and small molecular donor materials.
