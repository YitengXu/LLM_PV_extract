    , Accepted 17th January 2020First published on 17th January 2020AbstractWe report synthesis and characterization of novel hole-transport materials (HTMs) with substituents, methylsulfonyl, N,N-dimethylamino or methoxy groups, introduced onto the N of the carbazole unit of carbazole-arylamine and their application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We found that the new HTMs with a N,N-dimethylamino substituent exhibit superior hole extraction ability despite lower carrier mobility than that of methylsulfonyl and methoxy counterparts. After careful optimization of HTM concentration and deposition conditions, the PSCs using pristine and doped N,N-dimethylamino-based HTMs show a promising efficiency of 16.12% and 19.25%, respectively. Our findings unravel the influence of functional groups on power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered a feasible, inexpensive and promising technology among photovoltaics (PV) towards transition to a low-carbon society. As a result of the intensive and multidisciplinary study over the last decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells has improved rapidly from 3.8% to 25.2%.1,2 A typical PSC configuration includes a hole transporting material (HTM) sandwiched between the photoactive perovskite and a charge collection metallic electrode. HTMs are essential for charge extraction and transportation and also for preventing recombination at the interface and blocking electrons due to highly aligned HOMO–LUMO energy levels. In typical high-efficiency PSC devices, HTMs and electron-transporting materials (ETMs) are often required to promote charge separation and transport.3–8 To date, in high-performance PSCs, the most commonly used ETMs have been SnO2 and TiO2, which are stable and low-cost.9–11 However, the widely used organic hole transporting material, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), suffers from high cost and low stability.12–15 Therefore, alternative HTMs with different building blocks have been reported, such as carbazole, triphenylamine, thiophene, pyrene etc.8–16 Several groups have demonstrated that the molecular structure of HTMs exerts a great influence on the performance of PSCs. The optoelectronic properties of carrier-transporting materials and interfacial modification materials can be tuned by nitrogen and sulphur substituents.17–26
Herein, we investigate the effect of methylsulfonyl, N,N-dimethylamino or methoxy groups on HTMs. We introduce functional groups onto the N of the carbazole unit in carbazole-arylamine HTMs (see Fig. 1). A reference HTM, termed 3,6-O in this work, with a commonly used methoxy group was also prepared for a comparative study.27 The molecular structures of the newly developed HTMs and the reference compound are illustrated in Fig. 1 and the detailed synthetic processes are provided in the ESI.†

Results and discussion
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements are performed to evaluate the effect of the functional groups on the thermal stability of HTMs.28 The data are shown in Fig. 2, and the corresponding values are listed in Table 1. 3,6-O (2,7-O), 3,6-N (2,7-N) and 3,6-S (2,7-S) exhibit a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 121 (120), 129 (126) and 126 (121) °C, respectively. We note that the compounds with N,N-dimethylamino groups exhibit higher Tg values than the methylsulfonyl and methoxy counterparts. Interestingly, 3,6-substituents exhibit slightly higher Tg values than those of 2,7-based ones. The higher Tg values of HTMs can reduce the tendency of oriented crystallization (aggregation) upon heating, which is beneficial to morphological and corresponding device stability.29,30 Remarkably, the N,N-dimethylamino and methylsulfanyl-containing molecules show higher Tg than conventional spiro-OMeTAD (122 °C).31

The influence of substituent groups of the investigated HTMs on the photophysical properties was studied in dichloromethane solution, as shown in Fig. 3a. We note that all the compounds show weak absorption in the visible range of the spectrum, which would contribute minor parasitic absorption to perovskite layers in PSC devices. The maximum absorption peaks of 3,6-O (2,7-O), 3,6-N (2,7-N) and 3,6-S (2,5-7) are 335 (379), 332 (378), and 335 (379) nm, respectively. The 2,7-substituents show an obvious bathochromic spectral shift of the π–π* absorption band related to the 3,6-substituted counterparts, indicating a larger π-conjugated system of the former. N,N-Dimethylamino-based compounds show a little bit hypsochromic spectral shift compared to methylsulfanyl and methoxy counterparts, implying the stronger electron-donating ability of the N,N-dimethylamino unit.28 Interestingly, the compounds with methylsulfanyl and methoxy groups exhibit similar absorption ability. The emission spectra (Fig. 3b) of the methylsulfonyl-containing compound exhibit a larger Stokes shift (λs) than the other ones, which may be due to the larger atomic volume of S than those of O and N. Moreover, it can be noted that spiro-OMeATD exhibits a small λs value under the same conditions. Therefore, the molecules with N,N-dimethylamino groups would suffer a relatively smaller structural change in the excited state. The optical band gaps (Eg) of the investigated molecules are estimated from the absorption and emission spectra, the detailed values are also shown in Table 1. The molecules with N,N-dimethylamino groups show slightly larger Eg than those of methylsulfonyl or methoxy-containing counterparts.

The electrochemical properties of the investigated compounds are investigated with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The CV and DPV data are recorded in methylene chloride, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 4. In the case of the compounds with N,N-dimethylamino groups, the CVs (Fig. 4a, b) exhibit two reversible anodic peaks; in contrast, the oxidation behavior of the compounds with methylsulfonyl and methoxy groups is characterized by a single reversible peak. As shown in Fig. 4c, d, further insights gained by DPV confirmed the single oxidation occurrence of the compounds with methylsulfonyl and methoxy groups, while disclosing two oxidation occurrences in the case of N,N-dimethylamino counterparts, plausibly due to stronger electronic coupling between their two redox centers occurring on the molecule.33 The N,N-dimethylamino groups on compounds can preclude direct overlap among their localized molecular orbitals, which is beneficial to the mesomeric stabilization of mixed-valence states.34,35

Using the electrochemical data, the highest-occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of 3,6-O (2,7-O), 3,6-N (2,7-N) and 3,6-S (2,7-S) were estimated at −5.19 (−5.24), −5.18 (−5.22) and −5.19 (−5.23) eV, respectively. N,N-dimethylamino-based molecules show slightly higher HOMO levels than those of their corresponding counterparts, which can be attributed to the stronger electron-donating ability of the N,N-dimethylamino unit. Moreover, all the investigated molecules exhibit obviously deeper HOMO levels compared with those of conventional spiro-OMeTAD, suggesting that the corresponding PSCs may exhibit a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) than that of spiro-OMeTAD.36 It can also be found that the difference in HOMO levels is not as big as in the reported case,18,19 which may be due to fine structural changing (only one N,N-dimethylamino or methylsulfanyl unit). Their corresponding LUMO levels are calculated by: ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg, and the results are shown in Table 1. Fig. 7b shows the calculated HOMO/LUMO levels for the developed carbazole-arylamine HTMs, in comparison with the conduction band and valence band of TiO2 and the mixed perovskite, as well as the Fermi level of the Au counter electrode. The HOMO energy levels of all the developed HTMs are aligned excellently with the valence band edge of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 in this work (−5.65 eV),37 therefore, they are expected to have favorable driving force for facilitating hole extraction from perovskite layers in PSCs. On the other hand, the large barrier between the LUMO of HTMs and the conduction band of the perovskite could block the electron transport from the perovskite to Au and thus decrease the recombination process at the HTM/perovskite interface.
To further estimate the effect of the molecular structure on the hole extraction ability in perovskite solar cells, we use steady-state photoluminescence (TIPL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements to investigate the carrier transfer dynamics in the perovskite/HTM interface. The samples were prepared on the bare glass so as to avoid the charge injection between the active layer and FTO. As shown in Fig. 5a, b, the enhanced PL quenching effect was noted for the film made of 3,6-N (2,7-N) compared to those made of 3,6-O (2,7-O) and 3,6-S (2,7-S). This means that carriers generated in the perovskite are extracted more efficiently by 3,6-N. As shown in Fig. 5c, d, the estimated PL decay time is 22.5 ns for the perovskite monolayer. When the perovskite was coated with 3,6-O (2,7-O), 3,6-N (2,7-N) and 3,6-S (2,7-S), the time is shortened to around 8.9 (8.8), 7.2 (7.1) and 4.0 (4.4) ns, respectively. From these observations, it is noted that the HTMs with N,N-dimethylamino groups are beneficial to hole extraction in PSCs, which is consistent with the electrochemical properties of these materials.

As illustrated in previous reports, the carrier-transporting properties of HTMs exert a great effect on the performance of PSCs.18,38 Therefore, we further fabricated FTO/HTM/Au devices and measured the J–V curves under dark conditions to evaluate the conductivity properties of the developed HTMs, as shown in Fig. 6a, b. The thickness of 3,6-O (2,7-O), 3,6-N (2,7-N) and 3,6-S (2,7-S) is around 62 (59), 64 (62), 61 (65) nm, respectively. It can be found that the HTMs with methylsulfanyl or methoxy groups show superior conductivities to those of N,N-dimethylamino-based compounds, which is in agreement with previous report.18 Moreover, the hole mobility of the investigated compounds is also evaluated from space charge limited current measurements according to our previous reports. J–V curves of hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au are illustrated in Fig. 6c, d. 3,6-O (2,7-O), 3,6-N (2,7-N) and 3,6-S (2,7-S) show a hole mobility value of 7.84 × 10−6 (5.47 × 10−6), 1.25 × 10−6 (0.84 × 10−6) and 1.02 × 10−5 (8.98 × 10−6) cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It is noted that 3,6-substituents exhibit better carrier transport capability than 2,7-substituents, which is also consistent with our previous work.28 From the above results, it can be further concluded that though the HTMs with N,N-dimethylamino moieties show better hole extraction ability due to stronger mesomeric stabilization of mixed-valence states, they have inferior carrier transporting properties to those of the methylsulfanyl and methoxy counterparts.

All the HTMs show higher HOMO levels than the valence band of the perovskite, which can guarantee hole transfer from the perovskite to HTMs, as also illustrated in TIPL and TRPL measurements. To investigate the influence of molecular structures on the photovoltaic properties of devices, we fabricated conventional (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-based PSCs with developed HTMs according to previous reports.32 The detailed PSC fabrication process is shown in the ESI,† and the device architectures are shown in Fig. 7a.

Firstly, to eliminate the effect of common Li-TFSI and TBP, we use these compounds without any additives in these PSCs (term additive-free, stored under dark conditions for 2 days). Moreover, we also take 3,6-compounds as a model HTM to study the effect of the deposition amount of HTMs on PSC performance under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Each group of PSCs with different HTMs includes 5 independent samples. The mean values with the standard deviation of short-circuit current (Jsc), Voc, fill factor (FF) and PCE of each group are listed in Table S1.† It is noted that the 3,6-N-based devices fabricated at a relatively low concentration (20 mg mL−1) display the best photovoltaic performance. When the concentration of HTMs reaches 30 mg mL−1, 3,6-N-based devices exhibit obviously degraded performance, as also shown in Fig. S1,† which could result from the fact that a too thick hole transporting layer would not be beneficial for the hole transfer from the perovskite layer to the Au electrode, especially for 3,6-N (lowest carrier-transporting ability).39–41 Moreover, 3,6-N shows the best hole extraction ability but lowest hole mobility compared to those of 3,6-S and 3,6-O, therefore, reducing the hole transporting pathway is a potential way to improve device performance.38–40 20 mg mL−1 of HTMs is more suitable to achieve high performance, and the PCE of additive-free 3,6-N-based devices reaches 16.12%, with a Jsc of 20.80 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.04 V, and a FF of 74%. The thickness of dopant-free and doped 3,6-N is around 65 nm and 71 nm, respectively, measured using a step height measuring instrument. Under the same conditions, the 3,6-O- and 3,6-S-based best-performing devices show a PCE of 13.84% and 15.01%. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of champion devices employing different HTMs are shown in Fig. 8a. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The HTM with methylsulfanyl (3,6-S) groups exhibits a higher PCE than its methoxy counterpart, which could result from the higher hole mobility due to the existence of methylsulfanyl in the HTM structure.18,19,42

As shown in Table S1 and Fig. S1,† when the concentration of HTMs is 10 mg mL−1, all devices show a decreased PCE, which should result from the lack of effective Ohmic contact at the perovskite/HTM interface due to the thin HTM layer (hard to completely cover the rough perovskite layer).41,43 On the other hand, high hole mobility can guarantee efficient hole transfer in hole transporting layers, therefore, the deposition amount of 3,6-S and 3,6-O-based devices has a minor effect on the performance.32 The hysteresis behavior of the best-performing devices with additive-free HTMs was also investigated, as shown in Fig. S2 and Table S2.† Obviously, the 3,6-N-based device exhibit smaller hysteresis compared with that of 3,6-O and 3,6-S, which further prove the superior potential of N,N-dimethylamino-based HTMs.
Subsequently, common TBP and Li-TFSI additives are employed in HTMs (20 mg mL−1) to improve device performance according to a previous report.27,28,44 It is noted that the doped 3,6-O, 3,6-N and 3,6-S show conductivity values of 1.01 × 10−5, 8.47 × 10−6 and 1.32 × 10−5 S cm−1, respectively, for FTO/HTM/Au devices, which show the same trend as that of dopant-free HTMs (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 8b, Tables 2 and S3,† doped 3,6-N-based devices exhibit a high PCE of 19.25%, which is comparable with that of spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 19.19%, Fig. S2b†). As shown in Fig. S3,† the steady-state Jsc of the best-performing device with 3,6-N measured at a bias of 0.90 V for 600 s is approximately 21.22 mA cm−2, leading to a stabilized output power of 19.1%, which is consistent with the PCE obtained from J–V measurements. Under the same conditions, 3,6-O and 3,6-S exhibit a PCE of 17.86% and 18.39%, respectively. As shown in Fig. S4,† the performance variation trend of 2,7-based HTMs is totally the same as that of 3,6-based counterparts. Moreover, it can be noted that 3,6-based devices exhibit relatively higher PCE than 2,7-counterparts, which may result from the higher solubility.28 As a reference, additive-free (20 mg mL−1) and doped spiro-OMeTAD (73 mg mL−1) show a PCE of 12.74% and 19.19%, respectively, as shown in Fig. S5.†
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of doped 3,6-N and spiro-OMeTAD are shown in Fig. S6.† The devices with doped HTMs were also taken to study the long-term stability, as shown in Fig. S7.† All the PSCs were stored under dry and dark conditions (15% relative humidity at R.T.). It can be obviously noted that 3,6-N and 3,6-S-based devices also show better stability than reference 3,6-O, which could result from higher hydrophobicity and thermal stability of 3,6-N (Fig. S8†).
To further illustrate the effect of HTMs' molecular structure on the performance of PSCs, we also fabricated conventional n–i–p and p–i–n MAPbI3-based devices. The device architectures are shown in Fig. S9, 10.† As shown in Tables S5–7,† the performance variation trend of n–i–p and p–i–n MAPbI3-based devices is similar to that of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-based devices. 3,6-N exhibits the highest PCE compared to 3,6-O and 3,6-S at appropriate concentrations. Too thick 3,6-N leads to performance degradation, which further proves high reproducibility and reliability of experiments. Finally, the materials cost of 3,6-N is also estimated following the previous report.28 As shown in Tables S8 and 9,†3,6-N shows a low cost of around 31 $ per g, which is much lower than that of conventional spiro-OMeTAD.45,46 Therefore, 3,6-N could be a new promising alternative HTM for high-performance PSCs.
Conclusions
In summary, we have rationally developed a series of carbazole-arylamine HTMs for PSCs. N,N-Dimethylamino-based molecules show a hypsochromic spectral shift, and higher thermal stability and lower carrier mobility than those of methylsulfonyl and methoxy counterparts. It is found that the compounds with a N,N-dimethylamino moiety show a better extraction ability than those with methylsulfonyl and methoxy units, leading to enhanced device performance of PSCs. Promisingly, the PSCs with a pristine N,N-dimethylamino-based HTM show a PCE of 16.12%, which increases to 19% when their HTM is doped with Li-TFSI and TBP, similar to that of a device with spiro-OMeTAD. Therefore, the N,N-dimethylamino unit is promising for applications in hole-transport, electron-transport and interfacial modification materials.
