    , Accepted 18th April 2023First published on 19th April 2023AbstractSolar-driven water splitting offers a leading-edge approach to storing abundant and intermittent solar energy and producing hydrogen as a clean and sustainable energy carrier. More importantly, constructing well-designed photocatalysts is a promising approach to develop clean hydrogen energy. In this paper, flower spherical UiO-66-(SCH3)2/ZnIn2S4 (UiOSC/ZIS) photocatalysts are successfully synthesized by a simple two-step hydrothermal method, and they exhibit high hydrogen production activity in light-driven water splitting. The optimized 30-UiOSC/ZIS (the content of UiOSC was 30 mg) composite exhibits optimal hydrogen production activity with a hydrogen production of 3433 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 5 and 235 times higher than that of pure ZIS and UiOSC, respectively. In addition, a long-cycling stability test has shown that the UiOSC/ZIS composite has good stability and recyclability. Experimental and characterization results show the formation of a type-II heterojunction between UiOSC and ZIS. This effectively suppresses the recombination of electrons–holes and promotes the carrier transfer, thus significantly improving the hydrogen production performance. This research further promotes the application of UiO-66-(SCH3)2 in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen production and provides a reference for the rational design of UiO-66-based composite photocatalysts.
1. Introduction
Fossil fuels are non-renewable energy sources and have limited availability on Earth. With the increasing consumption of fossil fuels, there is already a shortage of fossil energy.1,2 The survival of human beings is inseparable from energy, which stimulates an urgent need to find a new energy source with abundant reserves that does not depend on fossil fuels.3 Hydrogen has attracted much attention as a renewable and clean energy source.4,5 The Earth contains abundant water resources, and solar energy is an inexhaustible source of energy, so photocatalytic technology can be used to drive water splitting into H2 under sunlight.6,7 Thus, it will realize the conversion of solar energy to hydrogen energy.8,9 In order to obtain high photocatalytic efficiency of hydrogen production and realize the practical application of this technology, the development of sustainable, efficient and stable photocatalysts has become the focus of research.10,11
Efficient photocatalysts need to have a suitable forbidden bandwidth, energy band position, high photocatalytic efficiency, good stability, and low cost. Among the many catalysts, metal sulfides (e.g., CdS, Cd1−xZnxS, and ZnIn2S4)12–15 exhibit more attractive activity compared to metal oxides (e.g., TiO2, ZnO, SrTiO3).16–19 This may be due to their remarkable visible light absorption ability and suitable energy band position.20 Among these sulfides, ZnIn2S4, as a sheet-like ternary metal-sulfide compound, shows outstanding chemical stability, visible light absorption, and environmental friendliness, and may be a highly potential and promising photocatalytic material.21–23 In particular, the nano-sheet-like structure of ZnIn2S4 not only completely ensures the contact area with other semiconductors, but also shortens the charge transfer distance.24,25 Nevertheless, the severe recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs greatly limits its application in photocatalytic H2 production.26,27 In order to solve this problem, different strategies have been proposed to accelerate its carrier transport, suppress carrier recombination, and improve the electron–hole separation efficiency, such as structural engineering, noble metal loading, ion doping, and construction of heterojunctions.28–30 Yin et al. reported that with the introduction of MoS2, CdS corrosion was obviously prohibited. The CdS@MoS2 core@shell heterostructure showed efficient charge separation, excellent hydrogen production performance, and high stability.31 Lu et al. researched the effect of MoSe2 distribution on CdS nanorods on the catalytic performance of composites.32 Decorating sulfides with a cocatalyst and construction of a heterojunction are promising strategies.
UiO-66 is a representative metal–organic framework (MOF) material in the field of photocatalysis, which is constituted by zirconium ions and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate.33 As a common MOF, UiO-66 not only has a highly porous structure, large surface area, and more active sites, but also has high stability and a flexible structure.34,35 One of the most fascinating characteristics is the ability to precisely fine-tune their chemical and physical properties due to the rich coordination chemistry of metal cations and the diversity of organic linkers.36–38 For example, changing organic linkers and introducing functional groups can provide a wide variety of compounds with different properties.39–42 Liu et al. reported that UiO-66-X variants (X = –H, –NH2, –NO2, –OH, –Br, –Br2) are widely used for photocatalytic oxidation. The UiO-66-NH2 group improves the NO removal efficiency most under irradiation with visible light.43 Li et al. studied the effect of different electron-donating groups (X = –OH, –NH2, –COOH, –NO2 and –H) in MOFs on the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation organic pollutants.44 However, the introduction of the functional group methylthio (–SCH3) is still relatively little studied. The –SCH3 group, as an electron-donating group, can better regulate the energy band position of methylthio-functionalized UiO-66.45 It is anticipated that it will contribute S 3p electrons to the aromatic connecting unit, acting as an auxochromic and bathochromic substituent on the aromatic ring to expand the absorption band to the visible-light area.46 However, the activity of using MOFs as the main catalyst is still not very high and requires precious metals for modification. In order to reduce the cost and apply it in practice, UiO-66 can be modified with functional groups, adjusted to a suitable band gap, and then a heterojunction can be constructed with ZnIn2S4 to enhance its photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production under visible light irradiation.
Considering the above advantages of –SCH3, herein, we have pre-synthesized UiO-66-(SCH3)2 (UiOSC). Then UiOSC was coupled with ZnIn2S4 to form an efficient UiOSC/ZIS composite via a solvothermal method for visible-light driven H2 release. Due to the appropriate conduction band and valence band positions of UiOSC and ZIS, a type II heterojunction was constructed. The strong light absorption properties of ZIS and the efficient electron extraction effect of UiOSC are utilized. The two materials were tightly combined, which promoted the separation and transport of electron–holes and effectively generated H2 from water splitting. Among these UiOSC/ZIS composites, 30-UiOSC/ZIS shows the best performance with the maximum amount of hydrogen evolution reaching about 3433 μmol g−1 h−1, which is 5 times that of the ZIS monomer (673 μmol g−1 h−1). In addition, the composite has high stability. After 16 h long-cycle test, the performance remains almost the same as the original, and the structure does not change significantly.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of UiOSC
The preparation of UiO-66-(SCH3)2 (UiOSC) was carried out through a solvothermal method.45 Typically, 64.5 mg of H2BDC-(SCH3)2 and 58.3 mg of ZrCl4 were dissolved in a mixed solution of 15 mL of DMF and 1.8 mL of acetic acid with continuous stirring for 30 min. The mixed solution was quickly transferred to a 25 mL high temperature Teflon-lined autoclave. Then, it was heated to 120 °C, and maintained for 24 h. After the stainless steel autoclave was gradually cooled to room temperature, the autoclave was opened and the final products were poured into a 50 mL centrifuge tube for centrifugal separation and precipitation. The product was purified with DMF and dichloromethane thoroughly and vacuum dried overnight at 60 °C to obtain the UiOSC sample.
2.2. Preparation of UiOSC/ZIS
The UiOSC/ZIS composite was rationally designed and prepared by a simple one-step solvothermal method. First, 34.0 mg of ZnCl2 and 110.1 mg of InCl3 were dissolved in 30 mL of a solvent mixture containing 20 mL of deionized water and 10 mL of anhydrous ethanol. Then, 30 mg of the as-prepared UiOSC was added. After sonication and stirring of the mixture for a few minutes, 75.1 mg of thioacetamide was dispersed in the solution mixture under continuous stirring. Subsequently, the above solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon liner, covered and loaded into a stainless steel reactor. The autoclave was placed into an oven and heated at 160 °C for 6 h. After being cooled to room temperature naturally, the resultant yellow precipitate was isolated by centrifugation. Subsequently the yellow precipitate was repeatedly washed twice with deionized water and ethanol, respectively. Finally, the obtained powder was dried at 60 °C using a vacuum oven overnight. The mass of UiOSC was controlled at 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg and 50 mg. Accordingly the synthesized samples were labelled as 10-UiOSC/ZIS, 20-UiOSC/ZIS, 30-UiOSC/ZIS, 40-UiOSC/ZIS, and 50-UiOSC/ZIS. Pure ZnIn2S4 was synthesized through a similar process without addition of UiOSC, and was also marked as ZIS. The synthetic process of UiOSC/ZIS is described in Scheme 1.

2.3. Photocatalytic H2 evolution measurements
The photocatalytic water-splitting reaction was carried out in a 200 mL Pyrex reaction cell connected with a closed glass gas circulation system (Labsolar-6A, BeijingPerfectlight). At the top of the Pyrex reaction cell, there is a quartz window for vertical illumination. Typically, 30 mg of the photocatalyst was dispersed in 80 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.75 M Na2S and 1.05 M Na2SO3 as sacrificial reagents. Before the reaction began, the mixed solution needed to undergo several complete evacuations to completely remove dissolved air and 20 mL of argon gas was added as the carrier gas. The reaction solution was kept at 25 °C in a thermostatic reaction bath connected to the reactor and vigorously stirred by using a magnetic stirrer at all times of the reaction.
A 300 W Xe arc lamp (PE300BFA, BeijingPerfectlight) with a UV cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was used as the visible light source. The generated hydrogen was transferred to an on-line gas chromatograph (Nanjing Renhua, GC-9890A) through a gas circulation system. Gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD, 5 Å molecular sieve column) was used to detect the volumetric amount of H2 produced. The entire reaction and detection unit was hermetically sealed. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was estimated by using the formula given in the ESI.†47
3. Results and discussion
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the crystal phase properties of the as-prepared photocatalysts. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the ZIS, UiOSC and UiOSC/ZIS composites with different composite ratios. UiOSC showed characteristic diffraction peaks as reported in the literature.48 Pure ZIS showed strong diffraction peaks at 2θ degrees of 21.6°, 27.7° and 47.2°, which could be assigned to the (0 0 6), (1 0 2) and (1 1 0) planes of ZnIn2S4 (PDF#65-2023), respectively.49 For the UiOSC/ZIS composites, the characteristic diffraction peaks of ZIS could be clearly observed, indicating that the crystal structure of ZIS in the composites remained unchanged. As compared, no diffraction peaks of UiOSC were observed in the 10-UiOSC/ZIS composites. This could be attributed to the less content of UiOSC and the characteristic peaks of UiOSC could not be detected. Moreover, as the content of UiOSC increased, distinct diffraction peaks could be observed between 5° and 6° in 30-UiOSC/ZIS, corresponding to UiOSC. This confirmed the successful combination of UiOSC and ZIS. In order to investigate the effect of different amounts of UiOSC on the crystallite size of ZIS during the solvothermal reaction, it was quantitatively analyzed by XRD. According to the Scherrer equation, the crystallite size of the ZIS and UiOSC/ZIS composites was calculated. The calculation results indicated that compared with ZIS, the crystallite size of various photocatalysts almost unchanged after varying the amount of UiOSC.
 Fig. 1  The XRD patterns of ZIS, UiOSC, and UiOSC/ZIS composites with different composite ratios. 
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed the morphologies and microstructures of the as-prepared samples. It could be observed from Fig. 2a that UiOSC has cubical nanoparticles with a nearly uniform size of about 40 nm. The SEM image of ZIS in Fig. 2b and c confirmed that ZIS had nanoflower microspheres composed of interweaving nanosheets, which had a large specific surface area and smooth surface. The ZIS nanoflower microspheres were estimated to be approximately 5 μm in size. As illustrated in Fig. 2d and e, the surface of ZIS became rough, indicating that UiOSC was attached to the nanosheet of ZIS nanoflowers. In this way, UiOSC was well dispersed on ZIS nanoflowers and formed close interaction. The TEM images (Fig. 2f) further clearly showed that the edge of the ZIS nanoflowers was a thin sheet, which was wrapped with the UiOSC nanoparticles. The nanosheets of ZIS were tightly combined with UiOSC nanoparticles to form a closely hybrid structure. According to high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) in Fig. 2g, it could be seen that the interfaces of ZIS and UiOSC were obviously criss-cross, and the lattice spacing of 0.32 nm was indexed to the (1 0 2) crystal plane of ZIS.50 The co-existence and distribution of Zn, In, S, C, O and Zr elements were detected from the EDX spectrum (Fig. 2h–n). These results demonstrated the successful synthesis of the UiOSC/ZIS composites.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to measure the elemental composition and surface chemical states of the UiOSC/ZIS composite and monomers. As could be seen from the full spectrum in Fig. 3a, the composite was mainly composed of C, O, Zr, Zn, In and S elements, which is in good agreement with the test results of EDX. Fig. 3b shows the Zn 2p spectra of the ZIS and UiOSC/ZIS composites, which could be fitted with two peaks, 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively, indicating that Zn2+ was present in the material.51 It could be seen that the peak values of ZIS were 1045.0 eV and 1022.0 eV, respectively, while those of the UiOSC/ZIS composite were 1045.2 eV and 1022.2 eV, respectively. The corresponding comparison between the two materials showed that the peak values of the UiOSC/ZIS composite were positively offset by 0.2 eV compared with those of the ZIS monomer. In the In 3d spectrum (Fig. 3c), two peaks of 452.5 eV and 445.0 eV could be fitted by ZIS, corresponding to In 3d3/2 and In 3d5/2, respectively, indicating the presence of In3+.52 The In 3d of the UiOSC/ZIS composite showed two signals around 452.7 eV and 445.2 eV, which were also positively offset by 0.2 eV compared with the peak value of ZIS. The S 2p spectrum (Fig. 3d) could be divided into two characteristic peaks, 2p1/2 and 2p3/2, respectively. The S 2p peak of UiOSC/ZIS was positively shifted by about 0.3 eV compared with that of ZIS. Compared with UiOSC, the S 2p peak of UiOSC/ZIS was negatively shifted by about 1.2 eV. The signals of Zr 3d in UiOSC centered at 185.0 eV and 182.7 eV (Fig. 3e) could be attributed to Zr 3d3/2 and Zr 3d5/2, respectively, indicating that the Zr elements are positively quadrivalent. However, the Zr 3d signal peaks of UiOSC/ZIS were observed at 184.9 eV and 182.6 eV, and were negatively offset by 0.1 eV compared with those of UiOSC. The O 1s spectrum of UiOSC (Fig. 3f) could be divided into two peaks, which were located at 531.9 eV and 531.0 eV, respectively, attributing to the CO and zirconium-oxo cluster, respectively. Similarly, the O 1s spectrum of UiOSC/ZIS was also divided into two peaks, and compared with UiOSC, its peak was negatively shifted by about 0.1 eV. According to Fig. S1,† it could also be seen that the C 1s peak of UiOSC/ZIS was also negatively shifted by about 0.1 eV compared with that of UiOSC. By comparing the shift of each element peak value between the UiOSC/ZIS composite and the two monomers, it could be demonstrated that there was a strong interaction between UiOSC and ZIS, and the electron cloud may shift from ZIS to UiOSC.

The photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of these materials was tested under simulated visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation. In the presence of the same sacrificial agent, 0.75 M Na2S and 1.05 M Na2SO3 mixed aqueous solution, the hydrogen production properties of the UiOSC, ZIS, and various ratios of UiOSC/ZIS composites were investigated as shown in Fig. 4a and b. The photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of pure UiOSC was almost zero. In contrast, the pure ZIS catalyst showed some photocatalytic hydrogen production performance with a hydrogen production rate of about 673 μmol g−1 h−1. The hydrogen production performance of the UiOSC/ZIS composites was significantly improved. After UiOSC was compounded with ZIS, various ratios of UiOSC/ZIS composites all exhibited photocatalytic hydrogen production activity, and the hydrogen production performance of the UiOSC/ZIS composites showed a parabolic shape. When the loading of UiOSC increased, the hydrogen production performance increased to a maximum and then decreased. This may be due to the low transfer rate of photo-generated electrons and holes when the content of UiOSC was low. When the content of UiOSC was high, the excessive UiOSC particles covering the surface of ZIS may block the active site or restrict the light absorption thus reducing the photocatalytic activity. So neither a small amount nor an excessive amount of UiOSC could make a big performance improvement of UiOSC/ZIS. 30-UiOSC/ZIS showed the best catalytic activity with a catalytic rate of 3433 μmol g−1 h−1, which was about 5 times higher than that of ZIS. The improvement of photocatalytic performance may be due to the enhancement of visible light absorption and the inhibition of electron–hole recombination by the appropriate amount of UiOSC. In order to verify that -SCH3 functionalized UiOSC shows better hydrogen production performance, the hydrogen production properties of the UiO-66 (unfunctionalized UiO-66) and UiO-66/ZIS (unfunctionalized UiO-66 combined with ZnIn2S4) composites were also investigated. UiO-66 had no H2 production under visible light irradiation (Fig. S2†). Furthermore, Fig. 4c shows a comparison of the properties of the 30-UiOSC/ZIS composite and its physical mixture, UiO-66/ZIS and Pt/ZIS. The hydrogen production rate of the Pt/ZIS photocatalyst and UiO-66/ZIS photocatalyst was improved, but was significantly lower than that of the 30-UiOSC/ZIS composite. These results demonstrated that the methylthio group of UiOSC played a crucial role in photocatalytic water splitting. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 30-UiOSC/ZIS was 10.55% at 420 nm. In addition, the catalytic activity of the UiOSC/ZIS composite was superior to those of most ZIS-based and MOF-based photocatalysts (Table S3†). The above results indicated that the UiOSC/ZIS composite was a good photocatalyst, which could significantly improve the performance of photocatalytic water splitting by promoting charge transfer. In addition, the photocatalytic stability of the UiOSC/ZIS composite was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 4d, the hydrogen production rate of the 30-UiOSC/ZIS composite showed little change after four cycles of testing. After the stability test, the 30-UiOSC/ZIS composite was collected and characterized by XRD (Fig. S3†), SEM (Fig. S4 and S5†) and TEM (Fig. S6†). By comparing the XRD patterns before and after the reaction (Fig. S3†), it could be seen that the crystallinity of UiOSC/ZIS has not changed. As shown in Fig. S4 and S5,† it could be seen that the UiOSC/ZIS composite after the reaction was still in the shape of nanoflower spheres, with the UiOSC nanoparticles attached to the surface. The presence of Zn, In, S, O, Zr and C elements could be confirmed through the corresponding EDX elemental mapping images. The TEM image in Fig. S6† further proved that the morphologies of the UiOSC/ZIS composite did not change. The above results manifested that the morphology and structure of 30-UiOSC/ZIS did not change, further demonstrating the structural stability of the UiOSC/ZIS photocatalyst during hydrogen production.

(c) Comparison of the H2 evolution rates on UiOSC/ZIS, physical mixture, UiO-66/ZIS and Pt/ZIS. (d) Cycling experimental results of 30-UiOSC/ZIS. 
Moreover, comparative H2 production experiments of ZIS and UiOSC/ZIS were performed using other sacrificial agents (non sulphur-containing) such as triethanolamine (TEOA) and lactic acid (LA). As could be seen from Fig. S7,† the hydrogen production was different in the presence of different sacrificial agents. However, when the same sacrificial agent was used, the hydrogen production rate of the UiOSC/ZIS composite was almost 5 times that of ZIS. This indicated that the presence of the –SCH3 group in the composite catalyst did not significantly affect the adsorption of sacrificial agents (Na2S and Na2SO3) compared with bare ZIS. In addition, the ZIS and UiOSC/ZIS composites did not produce H2 in the absence of sacrificial agents (full water), indicating that sacrificial agents play a key role in promoting charge separation and migration in photocatalytic reactions. This reflected that the UiOSC/ZIS composite showed good photocatalytic hydrogen production activity.
The optical properties of the different as-synthesized samples were characterized by using UV–vis absorption spectra. As displayed in Fig. 5a and b, the absorption band edge of pure ZIS was recorded in the visible range with a band edge at around 540 nm.53 UiO-66 (unmodified by functional groups) exhibited its fundamental absorption edge at around 320 nm, while UiOSC showed the absorption edge at 480 nm in the visible light absorption range. UiO-66 basically had no absorption in the visible light region above 420 nm, so no H2 was detected (Fig. S2†). The light absorption capacity of UiOSC was increased due to the influence of the modification of –SCH3 on the MOF. After ZIS was coupled by UiOSC to form the UiOSC/ZIS composite, the light absorption showed a red shift from 480 nm to 530 nm compared with pristine UiOSC. The UiOSC/ZIS composite showed strong visible light absorption compared with ZIS. Therefore, the introduction of UiOSC promoted light absorption. While, the absorption of the UiO-66/ZIS composite showed a blue shift compared with that of the ZIS monomer. By comparison, UiOSC/ZIS exhibited stronger visible light absorption capacity than UiO-66/ZIS, which was basically consistent with the hydrogen production activity above. It could be speculated that the introduction of the methylthio group promoted the absorption of light, thus enhancing the activity of visible light catalytic hydrogen production. The broader absorption, in the visible light region, could be related to the –SCH3 group in UiOSC and the interaction between UiOSC and ZIS, leading to greater light absorption capacity. According to the UV-vis absorption spectra, the bandgap of the photocatalysts was determined by the Kubelka–Munk (K–M) function.54,55 As disclosed in Fig. 5c and d, the calculated bandgap of ZIS and UiOSC was 2.55 eV and 2.70 eV, respectively, which were roughly the same as those reported in the related literature.45,56

To gain insights into the photoelectrochemical properties of the samples, their transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were analyzed. The transient photocurrent of UiOSC/ZIS, UiOSC, and ZIS was detected by using an electrochemical workstation under Xe lamp irradiation. The low photocurrent intensity of UiOSC and ZIS, as illustrated in Fig. 6a, could be ascribed to the rapid recombination of photoexcited electron–hole pairs. However, compared with two monomers, UiOSC/ZIS showed the most superior photocurrent value, demonstrating that UiOSC/ZIS possessed the best charge separation and transfer efficiency. This may be the reason that the charge was transported between ZIS and UiOSC, slowing down the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Furthermore, EIS was carried out to evaluate the interfacial charge separation ability of the photocatalysts. A much smaller semicircular arc radius denotes the more rapid interfacial charge transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers. From the Nyquist curve (Fig. 6b), UiOSC/ZIS had the smallest radius of the arc in the impedance spectra, indicating the lowest charge transfer resistance (Rct). The value of Rct could be fitted by using a simple equivalent model in the low-frequency region. The Rct value of UiOSC/ZIS was 62.51 Ω which was lower than those of ZIS (104.21 Ω) and UiOSC (78.01 Ω). The results confirmed that UiOSC/ZIS achieved a low charge transfer resistance and excellent catalytic activity.

Photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed to reveal the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes of the material, which further illustrated the good photocatalytic activity of the catalyst. Fig. 7a shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of these catalysts. All samples were monitored at an excitation wavelength of 375 nm. The PL peaks are rather broad, which may indicate varied recombination processes occurred. There are mainly two processes that the electron–hole pairs recombined by means of radiation or non-radiation.57 From the PL spectra (Fig. 7a), the peak centered at approximately 470 was due to radiative recombination, and was an extra emission band with lower energy than the band edge emission. The emission peak at 500 nm could be classified as band edge emission, which corresponded to the starting point of the absorption edge as shown in Fig. 5a.58 The low-energy tail band may be due to a recombination of donor–acceptor pairs.31,32 Pure ZIS showed strong PL intensity at 470 nm, indicating that ZIS shows severe carrier recombination. In comparison, the PL intensity of the UiOSC/ZIS composite was significantly weakened, demonstrating that the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes was significantly inhibited. The time-resolved PL spectra of the ZIS monomer and UiOSC/ZIS composite are shown in Fig. 7b. The average lifetimes of pure ZIS and UiOSC/ZIS were 5.38 and 5.21 ns, respectively (Table S2† lists the lifetime decay fitting parameters). The shorter lifetime of the UiOSC/ZIS composite revealed that the charge transfer rate between ZIS and UiOSC was increased, which suggested that this material effectively suppressed the recombination of charge carriers. Based on the above results, it was reasonable to infer that the heterojunction between UiOSC and ZIS allowed effective carrier separation and transfer, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic H2 production performance.

In order to investigate the photocatalytic mechanism in this research, the energy band positions of ZIS and UiOSC were analyzed. Firstly, the Mott–Schottky measurements were performed for ZIS and UiOSC. As could be clearly seen in Fig. S8,† the slopes of the Mott–Schottky curves for both materials were positive, indicating that they were both typical n-type semiconductors. The flat-band potentials of ZIS and UiOSC at pH = 7 were about −1.50 V and −1.15 V vs. Ag/AgCl, as shown by the Mott–Schottky plots. For n-type semiconductors, the conduction band potential is negative 0.1 eV compared to the flat band potential. Thus the conduction band potentials of ZIS and UiOSC are −1.60 and −1.25 eV vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. When converted to a standard hydrogen electrode, the conduction band potentials of ZIS and UiOSC are −1.40 and −1.05 eV vs. the NHE (EAg/AgCl = 0.197 eV), respectively. The band gap energy of ZIS and UiOSC was calculated to be 2.55 and 2.70 eV, respectively. Based on ECB = EVB − Eg,59 the valence band (VB) potentials of ZIS and UiOSC could be estimated to be +1.15 and +1.65 eV, respectively. The VB-XPS test (Fig. S9†) also showed that the VB potential of ZIS and UiOSC was +1.12 and +1.65 eV, respectively. This further demonstrates the accuracy of the band gap test results.
Based on the analysis of material characterization, energy band position analysis and experimental test results of photocatalytic water-splitting of hydrogen in this research, the possible charge transfer process of the UiOSC/ZIS heterostructure in the H2 production reaction and its photocatalytic mechanism were speculated. Depending on the energy band position, the conduction band (CB) potential of ZIS is −1.40 and that of UiOSC is −1.05 eV. In comparison, the CB of ZIS is more negative than that of UiOSC, while the VB of UiOSC is more positive than that of ZIS (Fig. 8a). When the co-catalyst UiOSC bound to the ZIS nanoflower-spheres, a type-II heterostructure was formed due to the matching of their CB and VB potentials. Under visible light irradiation, the ZIS nanoflowers were excited to produce electron (e−) and hole (h+) pairs due to their inherent optical absorption properties. Since the CB of UiOSC was more positive than that of ZIS, the photogenerated electrons of CB could quickly migrate from ZIS to UiOSC. The electrons then reacted with H+ in the water to form H2. The simultaneously generated holes were transferred from UiOSC to the surface of ZIS, which then reacted with the sacrificial agent (Fig. 8b). This promoted the efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs in the UiOSC/ZIS heterostructure, and their recombination of electron–holes was significantly suppressed compared to the single component. Therefore, the II-type heterojunction structure was constructed between the ZIS nanoflowers and the UiOSC nanoparticles. The synergistic effect between the two materials promoted the separation and transport of photogenerated electrons and holes, thus exhibiting a better photocatalytic hydrogen production activity.

4. Conclusions
In a nutshell, we have successfully designed a simple and easy method to synthesize a composite catalyst as a visible-light photocatalyst for H2 evolution. Here, by exploring the band gap structure of UiOSC and ZIS materials, a type-II heterojunction catalyst was rationally designed. This UiOSC/ZIS heterojunction catalyst could promote the separation and transfer of photo-generated electrons and holes, so it had high photocatalytic activity. The 30-UiOSC/ZIS composite showed high hydrogen production activity, which could reach 3433 μmol g−1 h−1. In addition, the construction of the heterojunction enhanced the stability of the material. The UiOSC/ZIS composite could achieve cycling stability lasting for at least 16 h. Our results will pave the way for the construction of UiO-66-based heterojunction catalysts for solar-powered clean fuel production.
