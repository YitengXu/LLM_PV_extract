    , Accepted 9th August 2012First published on 10th August 2012AbstractHigh-energy metal oxide surfaces are considered to be promising for applications involving surface–adsorbate electron transfer, such as photocatalysis and dye-sensitised solar cells. Here, we compare the efficiency of electron injection into different TiO2 anatase surfaces. We model the adsorption of a carboxylic acid (formic acid) on anatase (101), (001), (100), (110) and (103) surfaces using density functional theory calculations, and calculate electron injection times from a model dye into these surfaces. We find that the different positions of the conduction band edge of these surfaces determine the rate of electron injection (which is faster for the surfaces with lower-lying conduction band, among them the most stable (101) surface). However, if the dye's injection energy is enforced to be at a fixed energy deep inside each surface's conduction band, then several anatase surfaces, such as the synthetically achievable (001) surface, show rates of injection comparable or faster than the (101) surface. Moreover, because of their higher-lying conduction bands, these minority surfaces are likely to offer higher open-circuit voltages in dye-sensitised solar cells. Therefore, synthetically accessible high-energy anatase surfaces, such as (001)-oriented nanostructures, may be promising candidates for use in dye-sensitised solar cells.
1. Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is an important material with applications in dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs),1,2 photocatalysis and water splitting,3,4 sensors,5 and medical implants,6 among other things. The stable polymorphs of TiO2 are rutile and anatase; while bulk rutile is more stable, small TiO2 nanoparticles with the large surface area (e.g. such as used in the above applications) are typically composed of the anatase polymorph thanks to its low surface energy.7,8 Because of the small size of these nanoparticles, surface properties and the nature of the surface are important. The most stable and most commonly occurring anatase surface is the {101} crystallographic face.9 The order of stabilities of anatase surfaces in contact with the gas or vacuum phase, according to theoretical calculations,9 is, from the most stable to the least stable one, (101) > (100) > (103)-faceted ≥ (001) ≥ (103)-smooth > (110). TiO2 anatase nanoparticles in their equilibrium shape have a truncated bipyramid shape with eight {101} facets and two {001} facets, with the {101} facets accounting for 94% of the surface area.9 However, recently there has been an explosion in synthesis of minority (high-energy) anatase surfaces.10–17 Following the synthesis of {001} surface-dominated particles by Yang et al. using adsorbed fluoride ions to alter the surfaces' relative stability,10 anatase nanoparticles and nanosheets have been synthesized that expose large areas of {001}11–13,15,16 and {100}11,14–16 facets, and even such high-index facets as {105},18 (201) and (401).19 Their photocatalytic and photovoltaic properties have been studied, for example, DSSCs based on {001} surface-dominated nanostructures have been made, and their efficiency is comparable to the DSSCs based on standard TiO2 nanoparticles.20–24 Importantly, these high-energy surfaces were shown to be more reactive than the {101} surface, e.g. they show stronger interaction with adsorbates,25,26 higher rates of adsorbate-to-surface electron transfer27 and higher photocatalytic activity11,12,16 (although there is disagreement on the exact sequence of the surfaces' photoreactivities28–30).
Electron transfer properties are very important for the efficiency of DSSCs, because the operation of these solar cells relies on electron transfer between a photoexcited dye, photoanode composed of TiO2 nanoparticles, and electrolyte.31 Here, we study the effect of the TiO2 anatase crystallographic surface on the rate of one of the key processes in DSSC – charge injection from the photoexcited dye into TiO2. The aim of this work is to investigate how strongly different crystallographic surfaces of a semiconductor modulate the rate of charge injection. It is interesting to know if the surfaces' effect is due to a change in the band energies, or energies of the surface states, or due to different coupling with the adsorbate. From a fundamental point of view, knowing how the rate is modulated by the different surfaces may help interpreting charge injection experiments done on nanoparticles32–35 where it is often impossible to eliminate the minority surfaces. In this work, we study one key example – electron injection into high-energy anatase surfaces, and investigate if these surfaces are better at accepting the injected electron than the most abundant (101) surface and whether nanocrystals exposing these minority surfaces are likely to provide better efficiency than the standard {101}-dominated nanoparticles and should be used in real DSSCs.
Electron transfer rates at a dye-semiconductor interface can be predicted theoretically, and several theoretical approaches exist.36–40 Recently, we proposed a model for calculating electron injection times in DSSC via a partitioning scheme, where the TiO2–dye system is partitioned into fragments (TiO2 slab, its interface with the dye's anchoring group, and the isolated dye), and the electronic properties of the fragments (TiO2 density of states, TiO2–dye coupling, and the coefficients of the dye's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)) are used to calculate electron injection times.41,42 The advantage of this method is that it disentangles the effect of different components (e.g. the dye's chemical structure, injection energy, interface and adsorption geometry, surface structure), making it ideal for systematic explorations of the various components of the TiO2–dye system. For example, we have explored the effect of changing the dye,42 and that of changing the anchoring group.43,44 Here we study the effect of changing the surface.
We model electron injection into five TiO2 anatase surfaces: (101), (001), (100), (110) and (103). All of these surfaces have been observed in anatase particles used in DSSC,1,32 (101) is the dominant surface, but there are also synthetic routes to produce (001) and (100) surfaces in large amounts.10–17 With these surfaces, we use the same dye – perylenecarboxylic acid, which is a common model system for time-resolved experimental studies of charge injection34,35,45 and which shows a fast injection time according to experiments34,35,45 and calculations.36,39,42,43 We outline our computational setup and the procedure to calculate injection times in Section 2. First, we model these surfaces and adsorption of the carboxylic acid anchoring group (represented by the formic acid molecule) using density functional theory (DFT). In Section 3.1 we describe the geometries and adsorption energies of the various adsorption configurations. In Section 3.2 we calculate injection times for the different surfaces. Finally, we discuss the surfaces that provide the fastest electron injection.
2. Method
2.1. Electronic structure calculations
We used the CRYSTAL09 code46,47 with all-electron representation of TiO2, B3LYP hybrid density functional,48,49 triple valence plus polarization Gaussian basis set for Ti and O,50 and a double valence plus polarization basis set for C,51 all available on the CRYSTAL web site.52 This computational setup has been tested in our earlier publication53 and gives accurate values of TiO2 lattice parameters and a reasonable value of the TiO2 band gap.
The (101), (001), (100), (110) and (103) surfaces were modelled using slabs periodic in two dimensions. The slabs exposing these surfaces were created using the SLABCUT option in CRYSTAL09. We used the accepted models of these surfaces, as given in ref. 9. Note that two possible terminations have been proposed for the (103) surface: smooth and faceted.9 The (001) surface reconstructs under vacuum54–56 (reconstruction was also reported for the (100) and (103) surfaces under vacuum57), but it is not clear if these surfaces are reconstructed in solution10,58 – the relevant environment for hydrothermal and solvothermal growth of {001} and {100}-dominated nanoparticles and for DSSCs which operate in the electrolyte solution. Thus, we use the non-reconstructed structure for these surfaces.
Slabs of different thickness were optimised by relaxing all atoms in the slab. The number of k-points was controlled using the shrinking factor value of 8 (giving 21, 25 or 34 k-points per cell, depending on the surface). Optimisation criteria were: energy tolerance 10−7 Ha, root mean square (RMS) of the gradient 0.0003 Ha per Bohr, RMS of the displacement 0.0012 Bohr (default values). The convergence of slab properties was monitored by comparing surface energies (Fig. 1).

Surface energies Esurf were calculated as Esurf= (Eslab − nEbulk)/2n, where n is the number of layers, Eslab is the total energy of the slab and Ebulk is the total energy of a bulk unit cell. Note that a “layer” here and later in the manuscript means a (TiO2)2 layer (the repeated anatase primitive unit cell), rather than an atomic layer. For example, Fig. 2 shows two-layer (001) slabs, while all the other slabs in that figure are three-layer according to our notation.

These surfaces have been studied theoretically before,9,56,59–69 especially the more experimentally relevant (101) and (001) surfaces. Here, we have re-optimised the slabs and identified converged slab thicknesses, to have a uniform set of TiO2 structures for our following calculations of charge injection. Table 1 compares our calculated surface energies with the literature values and thus acts as a validation of our computational setup.

Fig. 1 shows that surface energies converge with the increasing number of layers (monotonously for (101), (001), (110), (103)-faceted slabs, oscillations for (103)-smooth and (100) slabs, similar to the behaviour of rutile (110) slabs70). We consider a slab converged if the surface energy changes by <0.05 J m−2 upon increasing the slab thickness by one layer. For most of the slabs, convergence is achieved at the three-layer thickness, except the (001) surface where two layers are sufficient, and the (100) surface which is not yet converged at the three-layer thickness. Our surface energies for the three-layer slabs are shown in Table 1 and compared with literature reports. According to our calculations, the surface energies increase in the order (101) < (100) < (103)-faceted < (103)-smooth ≤ (001) ≈ (110). There is good agreement between our calculated surface energies and literature values,9,59–67 especially with the calculations in ref. 62 done using the same B3LYP functional (surface energies were reported to be dependent on the DFT functional, with hybrid functionals giving slightly higher values than pure DFT).62
For the following calculations of the carboxylic acid adsorbed on TiO2 (Section 3.1), we used three-layer (2 × 1)-replicated slabs (36 atoms), except the (001) surface, where we used a two-layer (2 × 2)-replicated slab (48 atoms). Formic acid was adsorbed on one side of the slab, and the bottom layer was kept fixed during the optimisation, to mimic the effect of bulk TiO2. Adsorption energies of the formic acid were calculated and corrected for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) using the counterpoise method.71
The isolated perylenecarboxylic acid dye was modelled using a similar computational setup, but in a non-periodic simulation system.
Finally, we comment on the choice of the density functional. As can be seen in Table 1, the choice of the density functional slightly affects the calculated surface energies, but does not change the order of stabilities. We expect that, similarly, the calculated adsorption energies may be slightly dependent on the choice of the density functional, but not in a qualitative way. Our recent study ref. 43 showed that the density functional used does not strongly influence the calculated injection times: very similar results were obtained using either PBE or B3LYP functional for electronic structure calculations. We expect that newer functionals will give more accurate absolute positions of TiO2 bands and dyes' molecular orbitals, but the relative alignment of the dye's orbitals and the semiconductor's conduction band, relevant for injection times calculations, is likely to be less sensitive to the choice of functional. Similarly, dispersion should be significant for intermolecular interactions in a full TiO2–dye system (and will depend on the exact nature of each dye), but not so for surface–adsorbate interactions studied in this paper, which are likely to be dominated by chemical bonding and therefore not strongly affected by our neglect of dispersion interaction.
2.2. Calculations of electron injection times
We calculated electron injection times from the dye molecule into TiO2 using the procedure described in our earlier publications.41,42 Briefly, we consider electron transfer from an orbital |s〉 localised on the dye molecule (we use the LUMO orbital, which corresponds to photoexcitation dominated by the HOMO → LUMO transition) to a continuum of one-electron states {|l〉} forming the semiconductor (TiO2) conduction band. The orbitals |s〉, {|l〉} can be expressed as linear combinations of localised basis functions χm (for the molecule) and ϕk (for the semiconductor): |s〉 = Σmcmχm, {|l〉} = ΣkCklχk. The rate of electron injection Γ for non-orthogonal basis sets can be expressed as  where ρkk′(E) = ΣlClkClk′δ(E − El) is the semiconductor's energy-dependent density of states matrix (averaged over k-points in the semiconductor's Brillouin zone, as reported in ref. 72), Vmk are the couplings between the molecule's and semiconductor's basis functions (i.e. the corresponding elements of the Hamiltonian matrix for the TiO2–adsorbate system), Smk are the overlap matrix elements, El are the energies of the semiconductor's one-electron orbitals, and Es is the injection energy, i.e. the energy of the molecule's orbital |s〉.
Because of the localised nature of the basis functions χm and ϕk, the quantities that enter the above equations can be obtained to a high degree of accuracy from separate calculations of a slab with the dye's adsorbed anchoring group ({Vmk} and {Smk}, as well as {Ckl}) and the isolated dye (coefficients {cm}). In this way, we avoid doing calculations of a full “TiO2 + adsorbed dye” system, and we can scan through many different dyes (as in ref. 42), anchoring groups (ref. 44), or semiconductor surfaces (this work). Our earlier study ref. 42 showed that injection times calculated using formic acid as a model anchoring group are in very good agreement with the values obtained using the benzoic acid anchoring group or even using the complete dye as an anchoring group, therefore even the smallest carboxylic acid – formic acid – can be reliably as an anchoring group in our model.
3. Results
3.1. Adsorption of formic acid on TiO2 anatase surfaces
We modelled the adsorption of formic acid on anatase (101), (001), (100), (110), (103)-smooth and (103)-faceted surfaces. We take on board the results of the previous detailed theoretical studies of carboxylic acids on anatase (101) and (001).68,69 A range of structures have been predicted, the most stable adsorption geometries are molecular monodentate on anatase (101)68 and dissociated bridging bidentate on anatase (001).69 We are not aware of systematic studies of carboxylic acids adsorption on other anatase surfaces.
We adopted the types of adsorption configurations discussed in ref. 68 and 69 for anatase (101) and (001), and systematically constructed different possible adsorption geometries of formic acid on the other anatase surfaces. For each surface, we identified undercoordinated surface atoms: 4- or 5-coordinated Ti (Ti4c, Ti5c) and 2-coordinated O (O2c) (see also ref. 9). We considered three types of adsorption modes: dissociated bridging bidentate (labelled BB), dissociated bridging chelating (labelled BC) (in both cases, different adsorbed positions of the dissociated proton were considered, labelled “near” if H is adsorbed on a surface O atom near the Ti bonded to carboxylate and “far” if H is adsorbed on O in any other position) and non-dissociated monodentate (labelled MH). We modelled only the adsorption configurations accessible to any carboxylic acid (i.e. those where the H atom attached to the carboxylic carbon is pointing upward), and neglected configurations specific to formic acid as an aldehyde or as the smallest carboxylic acid (those where the H atom attached to the carboxylic carbon is interacting with the surface).
We chose cell sizes such that the minimum distance between the adsorbates is at least 5 Å, to take into account the fact that DSSC dyes often have bulky side groups,73 and a full coverage of all TiO2 adsorption sites in a DSSC will not be possible. Thus, we used (2 × 1) cells for the (101), (100), (110), (103)-smooth and (103)-faceted slabs and (2 × 2) cells for the (001) slabs. The resulting adsorption configurations are briefly discussed below. The geometries are shown in Fig. 2, and the adsorption energies in Table 2. The details of the geometries (surface–adsorbate Ti–O and O–H distances) are presented in Table S1, ESI.†

The (101) surface has one 5-coordinated Ti and one 2-coordinated O atom per surface unit cell. We considered two MH structures (MH1 as in ref. 68 and MH2 as in ref. 53), one BB and one BC structure. In agreement with the earlier studies,53,68 the molecular monodentate structures (Eads = −0.82 and −0.80 eV for MH1 and MH2, respectively) are slightly more stable than the BB structure, while the BC structure is unstable and converts to BB (either symmetric BB with two O–Ti distances of 2.1 Å or asymmetric with O–Ti distances of 2.02 and 2.55 Å) via an intermediate dissociated monodentate configuration.
The (001) surface has one Ti5c and one O2c per surface unit cell. Following the study in ref. 69, we considered two BB configurations (BB1 and BB2), another BB configuration (BB2a) with a broken Ti–O–Ti sequence, one MH and one BC configuration (with different positions of adsorbed H near and far from the adsorbed carboxylate in the BB2 and BC structures). In the MH configuration, the proton is partially transferred to the surface (Osurf–H distance 1.02 Å), but remains hydrogen-bonded to the molecule (OCOO–H distance 1.51 Å). The BB1 configuration is the most stable one (Eads = −1.97 eV), followed by the other bridging bidentate configurations, then monodentate and bridging chelating. This order of stabilities BB > MH > BC agrees with ref. 69, although the values of adsorption energies differ slightly, possibly due to a different coverage and different computational setup.
For the remaining surfaces, there are no earlier theoretical studies of carboxylic acid adsorption to compare with. The (100) surface has two O2c and two Ti5c per surface unit cell. We constructed one BB configuration (two versions, BB-H(near) and BB-H(far), which differ by the position of the adsorbed H), one MH and one BC configuration. The BB configurations were the most stable (largest Eads = −1.61 eV), followed by the molecular monodentate MH; the BC configuration relaxed into a dissociated monodentate configuration M (less stable than the others). This, the order of stabilities is BB > MH > M.
The (110) surface has one Ti4c and two O2c per surface unit cell. Because of the large distance between the Ti4c atoms, BB configurations are not possible. We constructed one BC (with two positions of H) and one MH configuration; these configurations turned out almost isoenergetic: MH ≈ BC, with the largest Eads = −1.33 eV for MH.
The (103) surface, both with the smooth and faceted termination, has a very complex structure, and a large number of adsorption configurations can be conceived. On the (103)-smooth surface, which has one Ti4c and two inequivalent O2c per surface unit cell, we constructed one BB and one BC configuration (both with two different proton positions) and two MH configurations. In one of the monodentate configurations (MH1), a proton was transferred to the surface during optimisation, creating a dissociated monodentate configuration M1, while the other configuration (MH2) retained its molecular character. More MH or M configurations can be envisaged, but because (103) is a minority surface in anatase nanoparticles, we did not carry out an exhaustive search for all possible monodentate configurations. Bridging bidentate BB1 is the most stable configuration (Eads = −2.33 eV), and the overall order of stabilities is BB > BC > MH.
The (103)-faceted surface has two inequivalent Ti5c and two inequivalent O2c per surface unit cell. We constructed two BB and two BC configurations, adsorbed at the two inequivalent types of Ti5c atoms, and three MH configurations, although more MH configurations may be possible. Two of the BC transformed into dissociated monodentate configurations M and M′, and one of the MH had its proton transferred to the surface, but retained a hydrogen bond to the carboxylate. One of the BB configurations is the most stable one (Eads = −1.41 eV), followed by another BB, then MH and then BC and dissociated M, thus the overall order of stabilities is BB > MH > M ≥ BC.
The adsorption energies for all configurations are summarised in Table 2. We can see that the most stable (101) surface is the only one where molecular monodentate adsorption is preferred to dissociated bridging bidentate (although it is very close in energy to BB), while the other, higher-energy surfaces favour bridging bidentate adsorption (except the (110) surface, where a BB structure is not possible, and BC and MH are almost isoenergetic). In particular, the presence of 4-coordinated Ti atoms on the (110) and (103)-smooth surfaces makes BB and BC configurations more strongly bound compared to the equivalent configurations adsorbed on Ti5c sites.
The strength of adsorption of the most stable configurations (strongest to weakest) follows the sequence (103)-smooth > (001) > (100) > (103)-faceted > (110) > (101) and roughly correlates with the surface energies: (110) ≈ (001) ≥ (103)-smooth > (103)-faceted > (100) > (101). Adsorption is stronger on higher-energy surfaces (see also Fig. 3; the notable exception is the (110) surface where the usually very strongly bound BB configuration does not exist). These results may help explain the experimentally observed higher reactivity of high-energy surfaces.11,12,16,25

3.2. Charge injection
We calculated injection times from a model dye into these TiO2 surfaces, using the methodology described in Section 2.2. As a benchmark dye, we use perylenecarboxylic acid, which provides fast electron injection into TiO2 and has been a subject of several experimental and theoretical studies of charge transfer rates.34–36,39,44,45
The injection times calculated using this molecule's LUMO energy (−2.37 eV according to our DFT B3LYP calculations) as the injection energy are presented in the third column of Table 2 for all computed adsorption geometries. The injection times for the most stable configuration on each surface are plotted in Fig. 4. It is immediately obvious that the injection times for these surfaces are very different from each other, from several femtoseconds for the (001), (100) and (110) surfaces and tens of femtoseconds for the (101) and (103)-faceted surfaces to hundreds of picoseconds for the (103)-smooth surface.

The reason for these large differences becomes clear if we inspect the slabs' electronic structure: injection times depend on the position of the injection energy relative to the TiO2 conduction band (Fig. 5), and the position of the slabs' conduction band minimum (CBM) depends on the crystallographic orientation of the surface. The CBM energy values in Fig. 5 have been computed using fully optimised symmetric slabs, as detailed in the ESI† and summarised in Table S2. While these energies for the most abundant (101), (001) and (100) surfaces are all within 0.3 eV, there is a 1.7 eV spread if the less common (103) surface (with the smooth termination) is included.

The dependence of the work function and, equivalently, the conduction band and valence band energies on the crystallographic orientation of the surface has been previously reported both for TiO2 and for other metal oxides. For example, a theoretical study65 of the same anatase surfaces using the PBE density functional reported a range of work functions and electron affinities for these TiO2 surfaces, in good qualitative agreement with our results. Experiments on TiO2 rutile (110) and (100)-oriented single crystals showed a 0.07 eV difference between these surfaces' work functions,74 and electrochemical studies of the same surfaces in the aqueous solution showed a similar 0.09 eV difference between their flatband potentials and, therefore, between the conduction band edge positions.75,76 Electrochemical studies77 of anatase (101) and (001)-oriented single crystals showed that the (001) surface had a 0.06 V more negative flatband potential (i.e. its CBM is closer to the vacuum level). This is the same trend as that shown by our calculations, although the calculated energy difference is bigger (0.20 eV). On the other hand, these results are in disagreement with another recent study28 which combined X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and found the ordering of the conduction bands to be (101) ≈ (010) > (001); however, all the CBM values were within a very narrow interval of 0.05 eV. These results suggest that further experimental studies of TiO2 band positions may be needed. Interestingly, the large difference in the conduction band position (or in the work function) of the smooth and faceted terminations of the (103) surface may help experimentalists distinguish between these surface terminations and conclude which of them occurs in experiment. Variation of the work function and band energies (within 0.08–0.65 eV) depending on the crystallographic orientation of the surface has also been reported (both experimentally78,79 and computationally80) for other metal oxides: Cu2O,78 WO3,79 Fe2O3.80

Fig. 5 shows that the injection times for the considered anatase surfaces are in agreement with the position of the slabs' conduction band relative to the dye's LUMO: (101), (103)-faceted, (001), (100) and (110) slabs have a deep-lying conduction band, and the LUMO of the perylenecarboxylic acid is far inside the conduction band (1–1.5 eV above the CBM). Thus, all of these slabs have a high TiO2 density of states (DOS) at the injection energy of the perylene dye and therefore show fast injection. The injection rates are similar across these different surfaces, because the DOS for all the surfaces is sufficiently high at the injection energy deep inside the conduction band. (In fact, the rates for the (101) and (103)-faceted slabs are slightly lower, because the injection energy lies deeper than the maximum DOS of these slabs53). On the other hand, the (103)-smooth surface has its conduction band so high that there are virtually no states to accept the electron, and injection from the perylene dye is almost impossible. We conclude that the semiconductor density of states at the energy of injection is the main factor that controls the injection time in this series.

Table 2 also shows that injection times for different adsorption configurations on the same surface are generally similar (usually slightly faster for the more strongly adsorbed configurations), although in some cases there are noticeable differences in injection times between similar structures that differ only by the position of the dissociated hydrogen atom (e.g. BB and BC structures on the (001) surface). The latter can be explained by a combination of two factors: first, we observe that the surface density of states is somewhat affected by the species adsorbed next to the dye (the protons in this case). Another reason for these differences is related to the use of constrained slabs in our calculations: the lowest level in the conduction band of these slabs is mainly localised on the fixed Ti atoms (similar to the situation for anatase (101) and rutile (110) slabs53), while the higher levels (several tenths of eV higher at the Γ k-point) have a higher contribution of the free surface Ti atoms; this difference in the composition becomes much smaller for the levels deeper in the conduction band and therefore the difference in the calculated injection times becomes smaller.
We checked that the surface–adsorbate coupling is not the major factor responsible for the difference in injection times: the range of Vmk values is very similar across the different surfaces. We also note that the rate of injection has a weak correlation or no correlation with the strength of adsorption and with the surface energy (as can be seen in Fig. 4), therefore these simple metrics cannot be used as indicators of charge injection time.
An interesting consequence of the dependence of the injection efficiency on the conduction band energy is that, if we want to use TiO2 nanoparticles exposing large areas of reactive high-energy surfaces, such as (001) and (100), then different dyes may need to be designed than for the (101) surface, with the dyes' excited states specifically tuned for good alignment with the TiO2 conduction band.
The next question to investigate is whether it is worthwhile to use TiO2 nanoparticles that expose high-energy surfaces (and offer stronger dye adsorption), considering that their synthesis is at present more difficult and new dyes probably need to be designed, to have a better alignment of their excited states with TiO2. To investigate this, we compared the inherent injection efficiency of these anatase surfaces, by artificially imposing the injection energy to be 0.6 eV above each slab's conduction band minimum (results in the fourth column of Table 2). In this numerical experiment, the injection times will depend only on the surfaces' densities of states at the injection energy and on the (not very surface-dependent) dye–semiconductor electronic coupling.
We find that for the injection energy Einj= ECBM + 0.6 eV, the (001) surface has the fastest injection, followed by (103)-faceted, then (101) and (100) (order of femtoseconds), while (110) and (103)-smooth surfaces are the slowest (tens to hundreds of femtoseconds), see Fig. 4. At higher (fixed) injection energies, injection times become faster thanks to the higher TiO2 DOS, but the ordering of the surfaces remains similar (not shown). Comparing these results with the injection times calculated at Einj= ELUMO, we can see that the effect of the difference in the surfaces' DOS at a fixed energy on the injection times is much weaker than the effect of the shift in the conduction band edge. These results underscore the importance of choosing a dye with its excited state well aligned to the TiO2 conduction band.
Based on these results, we can make conclusions on the different anatase surfaces' efficiency for electron injection and for use in DSSCs. (i) The most stable and most abundant (101) surface is also one of the best surfaces for electron injection. (ii) Several higher-energy surfaces offer electron injection rates faster or comparable to the (101) surface. Some of these surfaces (for example, the (103)-faceted surface), at present, cannot be synthesised in large quantities. However, the (100) and especially the (001) surfaces are promising competitors. (iii) Because the (001) and (100) surfaces have the conduction bands lying slightly higher than that of the (101) surface, they can provide higher open-circuit voltages in DSSCs (which correspond to the difference between the TiO2 nanoparticles' Fermi level and the redox potential of the redox couple1) and therefore higher power conversion efficiencies of DSSCs. Further arguments in favour of the (001) surface are that adsorption of carboxylic acids is stronger and the surface unit cell area is smaller than in the (101) surface, thus potentially providing a higher density of adsorbed dyes and therefore a higher density of injected electrons and a higher photocurrent (with the caveat that in the case of bulky dye molecules, the density of adsorption may be controlled not only by the density of the available adsorption sites but also by the size of the adsorbate).
The attractive properties of the (001) surface in DSSCs are supported by experimental reports. For example, several studies20–23 found higher efficiencies of DSSCs made using (001)-dominated nanosheets (6.6–7.9%21–23) compared to the standard (so-called P25) TiO2 nanopowder or (101)-dominated nanoparticles (4.7–6.7%21–23). The open-circuit voltages VOC were approximately the same, but the short-circuit currents JSC for the (001) surface-based DSSCs were 15–55% higher than for the (101) surface-based DSSCs. The improved photocurrent was attributed to better dye loading due to more adsorption sites present on (001) surfaces, stronger dye adsorption on these more reactive surfaces, and better light scattering by the (001) planes.
Similar behaviour was observed for rutile single crystals:81 DSSCs based on high-energy rutile (100)-oriented crystals showed a much larger (four times larger) photocurrent and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) than DSSCs that used lower-energy (110) rutile surfaces; the difference in the behaviour was attributed to the larger density of adsorbed dyes allowed on the (100) surface.
Another recent study24 found a slightly lower efficiency (4.3% vs. 4.7%) for DSSCs based on (001)-dominated nanosheets than for (101)-dominated nanoparticles, with lower JSC but higher VOC for the (001)-based DSSCs. This slightly lower photocurrent was attributed to the much smaller (by 25–40%) surface concentration of the adsorbed dye on the (001) nanosheets. Importantly for comparison with our study, the open-circuit potential was 0.048 eV higher in (001)-dominated DSSCs, indicating a higher-lying conduction band of the (001) nanostructures, in agreement with our sequence of conduction band energies.
The position of the bulk levels (which need to be accessed by an electron travelling to an electrode) in a particle bound by facets with different crystallographic orientation is difficult to define. The surface structure and the surface-related shift of the energy levels are important for nanoparticles used in dye-sensitised solar cells, which are small and therefore dominated by the surface electronic structure. The quasi-Fermi level of these TiO2 nanoparticles (which is an important property that affects the output voltage) is a quasi-equilibrium property, and the electrons in the semiconductor are equilibrated after they are injected: the energy of electrons injected in a surface with higher conduction band levels will be dissipated as heat. By comparison, the kinetics of injection (i.e. the very first approach of the electron into the nanoparticle), which is studied in this paper, depends only on surface properties and is not affected the fate of the injected electron.
In summary, based on our computational results and experimental observations,20–24 the (001) surface appears to be a valid competitor to the (101) surface in DSSCs.
4. Conclusions
We have studied electron injection from a model carboxylated dye into different anatase surfaces. First, we carried out an extensive study of adsorption configurations of carboxylic (formic) acid on anatase (101), (001), (100), (110), (103)-smooth and (103)-faceted surfaces. We found that the preferred adsorption mode is bridging bidentate on most of these surfaces, except the most stable (101) surface (where monodentate adsorption is slightly more favourable) and the (110) surface where bidentate mode is not compatible with the surface structure. The strength of adsorption of formic acid on these surfaces correlates with the surface energies: adsorption is stronger on higher-energy surfaces.
Using a partitioning procedure,41,42 we have combined the electronic properties of the TiO2–carboxylic acid interface (TiO2–adsorbate coupling and TiO2 density of states) with the electronic properties of a model perylenecarboxylic dye (the dye's LUMO coefficients) and calculated electron injection times from the dye into the TiO2 surface. We have found that, when the same injection energy above the TiO2 slab's conduction band is imposed, several surfaces provide fast injection times similar to the most stable (101) surface; in particular, the (001) surface (which can be controllably synthesised10) has the fastest injection. However, the most significant factor affecting the efficiency of electron injection is the difference in positions of the conduction band of slabs exposing these surfaces. For example, the model perylene dye injects very fast into (001), (100) and (110)-oriented slabs (the model dye's injection energy is deep in the conduction band), slightly more slowly into (101) and (103)-faceted slabs (the injection energy is even deeper in the conduction band, slightly beyond the maximum density of states), and almost not at all into (103)-smooth terminated slabs (the injection energy is below the conduction band edge), and the fastest and slowest injection rates differ by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, to use, for example, (001)-dominated nanoparticles in DSSC, new dye sensitisers may need to be designed than for the (101) surface, such that these dyes' excited state energies lie sufficiently deep with respect to the TiO2 conduction band. Having good electron injection rates, the minority surfaces with high-lying conduction bands and a large concentration of injected electrons are likely to provide higher open-circuit voltage in DSSCs. Our results may also be helpful in interpreting transient absorption measurements of injection times, as many experiments are carried out on TiO2 nanoparticles containing both majority (101) and minority surfaces.
In summary, we show that some of the high-energy TiO2 anatase surfaces, notably the synthetically achievable (001) and (100) surfaces, are promising surfaces for efficient electron injection in DSSCs.
