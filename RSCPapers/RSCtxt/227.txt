1. Introduction
With the escalating consumption of fossil fuels, the increase in CO2 emissions has become a grave concern and poses a significant threat to the environment. As a result, extensive research has focused on converting the excess CO2 into valuable chemicals, aiming to store and utilize renewable energy in chemical bonds.1–9 Several viable strategies, including biochemical, photochemical, thermochemical, and electrochemical methods, have been proposed to tackle the issue of excessive CO2 in the atmosphere.10 Among these methods, the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has garnered significant attention due to its energy-efficient and environmentally friendly approach to converting CO2 into important chemical feedstocks, such as methanol (CH3OH), which can be utilized as fuel or for industrial production.11–15 However, the electrochemical CO2 reduction process faces challenges, including competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER),16–18 as well as the inertness and insolubility of CO2 molecules in water, along with the complexity of multi-electron transfer processes.19–21 These limitations highlight the necessity of seeking competent catalysts that can efficiently and selectively convert CO2 into targeted products.
Noble metal-based electrocatalysts, such as Au,22–24 Ag,25–30 and Pd,31–33 have been the subject of substantial research interest in recent decades due to their fascinating properties. However, their limited availability and high cost present obstacles for large-scale applications, necessitating the exploration of alternative catalysts. Apart from Cu nanoparticles, which can produce hydrocarbons and alcohols simultaneously through CO2 transformation,34–36 in recent years, Sn-based materials have gained significant attention as viable alternatives, offering economic viability compared to Bi- and In-based materials, low toxicity relative to Cd-, Pb-, Hg-, and Ti-based materials, ease of modification, and, crucially, environmental friendliness. These appealing characteristics have propelled Sn-based materials as highly promising candidates,37–41 particularly in electrochemical CO2 reduction applications.42–46 By harnessing the unique properties of Sn-based materials, researchers can design rational and efficient electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2, contributing to sustainable and cost-effective approaches.
Currently, there are several high-quality articles with systematic reviews of designing effective electrocatalysts towards electrochemical CO2 reduction.6,15,47–51 Despite the presence of a review on Sn-based electrocatalysts for CO2RR, there is currently a lack of comprehensive compilation regarding recent advancements in catalyst design and the insights gained through in situ characterizations. This gap necessitates the need to address this issue and offer a thorough overview of the latest developments in catalyst design and the understanding of underlying mechanisms. By bridging this gap, researchers can further enhance their knowledge and facilitate the development of improved catalysts for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction.
This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the significant advancements in Sn-based materials as prospective electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction. It begins by introducing the fundamental mechanisms underlying electrochemical CO2 reduction, establishing a solid foundation for subsequent discussions. After that, an integrated framework incorporating rationalizing the design of Sn-based electrocatalysts and current research trends in this field are presented. Furthermore, this review concludes with a thoughtful discussion of the open challenges and important future directions, providing a comprehensive account that elucidates recent progress and outlines future research prospects in this emerging field. By offering a thorough analysis of the latest advancements and potential avenues for future research, this article serves as an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the design and development of Sn-based electrocatalysts for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction.
2. CO2RR mechanism
The CO2RR is a highly intricate process that involves multiple-electron transfer reaction pathways (2e−, 4e−, 6e−, 8e−, 12e−), resulting in the production of various carbonaceous products. These products encompass C1 species such as CO, CH4, HCOOH, and CH3OH, C2 species including C2H4, C2H5OH, and C2H6O2, as well as higher carbon products (C2+), for example, C3H8O.50,52 Over the past few decades, extensive experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to elucidate the reaction mechanism of CO2RR.53–57 In the laboratory, the electrochemical CO2 reduction is primarily conducted in an H-type electrochemical cell containing two chambers: a cathode chamber and an anode chamber, separated by an ion-conducting membrane (require pretreatment before the experiments), as shown in Fig. 1a. An external power supply is demanded to drive a non-spontaneous electron transfer reaction, converting electrical energy into chemical energy. In the anode chamber, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a half reaction of electrochemical water splitting, takes place, resulting in the generation of O2, electrons, and protons.47,50,58,59 The CO2RR process typically comprises three main steps, as illustrated in Fig. 1b.60 Initially, CO2 molecules are adsorbed onto the catalyst surface, forming chemical bonds.

Subsequently, the application of electrode potential facilitates the transfer of electrons or protons generated from the OER in the anode chamber across the membrane. This transfer effectively cleaves the CO bonds, leading to the formation of reaction intermediates. The entire process concludes with the desorption of CO2 molecules from the catalyst surface.60–64
It is important to note that the activation of CO2 molecules occurs at the gas–liquid–solid three-phase interface, and this process is influenced by various factors. (i) The cation effects, which have been pioneered by Paik et al. in 1969,65 play a critical role in the physical properties of the electrocatalytic interface.66 To begin with, the absorption of cations on electrocatalysts impedes the interaction of CO2 molecules with the active sites. Additionally, these effects influence the transfer of electrons or protons, the electric dipole moments, the polarizabilities of absorbed intermediates, as well as the chemical interactions between cations and the aforementioned intermediates. Moreover, the pH buffer ability and the interfacial water structure can also be affected.67,68 Notably, the influence brought by cation effects to the CO2RR process can also be determined by the size of these cations. In other words, larger cations adsorb at the electrode surface possess a greater degree of specificity, thus developing a more positive potential at the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP).69 In 2016, Singh et al.70 gave deep insight into this phenomenon, where they found that the increase of the size of cations will result in more active cathode, owing to the decrease of the pKa for cation hydrolysis where hydrated K+, Rb+, and Cs+ can act as buffers and the lower pH, which lead to the increase of interfacial CO2 concentration. However, the effects on faradaic efficiencies varied from different products, for instance, the faradaic efficiencies of H2 and CH4 decrease, while the faradaic efficiencies of CO, C2H4 and C2H5OH increase. After that, in 2020, in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was employed by Malkani et al.71 to explore whether the increase of the size of metal cations will have impact on interfacial CO2 concentration. Albeit a lot of works have been done over the cation effects, there is still a requirement for further investigation, such as the study on which specific metal cation can have obvious impact on the CO2RR thus leading to higher products selectivity. (ii) The pH value of the applied electrolyte not only can influence the solubility of CO2, but also have impact on the CO2RR process thermodynamically.72 (iii) Other influencing factors, like different types of electrolytes (aqueous solutions, organic electrolytes, ionic liquids and solid-oxide electrolytes),73 applied potentials and currents,74 electrode and membranes,75 the anion effects, ionic conductivity, and toxicity are also the determinants of the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts.68,72
From a thermodynamics perspective, the CO2RR process is an uphill reaction with sluggish chemical kinetics and low selectivity towards specific products, primarily due to the inherent stability of CO2 molecules. It is said that the standard formation energy of CO2 and the required energy to dissociate CO bonds are −394.4 kJ mol−1 and 750 kJ mol−1, respectively.62,76,77 Apart from this, in order to cater the concept of environmentally-benignity, the formation of target products from CO2 conversion also needs less energy input, that is to surmount the standard redox potentials of each reaction, which can be visualized in Table 1.50,59,78 Therefore, the unremitting efforts of many scientific researchers have devoted themselves to develop electrocatalysts to overcome these existing challenges.

As discussed previously, the CO2RR process is carried out in a typical H-type electrochemical cell with three-electrode system in the laboratory, which is measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Chronopotentiometry, Tafel curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In addition, gas chromatography (GC), high-performance chromatography (HPLC), mass spectroscopy (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are implemented after electrochemical measurements for the identification of the as-generated gas or liquid products.79 In order to evaluate the performance of catalysts in the CO2RR process, several indicators associated with the aforementioned measurements can be introduced. These indicators include faradaic efficiency (FE), current density, partial current density (FE × total current density), stability, overpotential, Tafel slope, turnover frequency (TOF), and electrochemical surface area (ECSA).80,81 These indicators provide valuable insights into the catalyst's performance, selectivity, stability, and activity in converting CO2 into desired products.
While the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into value-added products is an intriguing prospect, there are several limiting factors that impede its progress. These factors include the inert nature of CO2 molecules, their insolubility in the electrolyte, and the complexity of electron transfer processes required to achieve high efficiency and selectivity in the production of targeted products. These challenges highlight the crucial need for efficient and selective catalysts capable of converting CO2 into desired products.
As mentioned earlier, Sn-based materials have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their exceptional properties. In the following section, we will delve into the rational design strategies employed for Sn-based electrocatalysts, which have the potential to greatly enhance the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR process.
3. Sn-based electrocatalysts for CO2RR
It is worth noting that Sn-based electrocatalysts exhibit a strong preference for formate production during CO2RR, attributed to their pronounced interactions with *OCHO species compared to metals like Au, Ag, Pt, and Cu. This unique characteristic makes them highly efficient in generating HCOO− (Fig. 2).53 The CO2RR pathway for formic acid synthesis involves multiple crucial steps and adsorption structures. CO2 + H+ + e− → COOH*(R1)
 Fig. 2  Volcano plot using *OCHO binding energy as a descriptor for HCOO− partial current density at −0.9 V vs. RHE. Reproduced from ref. 53 with permission from the ACS publication, copyright (2017). 
This equation represents the reduction of CO2 by accepting a proton and an electron to form COOH* (carbonic acid intermediate). CO2 + H+ + e− → HCOO*(R2)
This equation depicts the reduction of CO2 by accepting a proton and an electron to form HCOO* (formate intermediate). COOH* + H+ + e− → HCOOH + *(R3)
In this step, COOH* undergoes protonation and electron transfer to produce HCOOH+* (protonated formic acid intermediate). HCOO* + H+ + e− → HCOOH + *(R4)
Here, HCOO* is protonated and accepts an electron to yield HCOOH + * (protonated formic acid intermediate).
Additionally, the adsorption structures of COOH* and HCOO* on different surfaces and sites have been explored. Solvation stabilizations of 0.18 eV and 0.06 eV have been observed for COOH* and HCOO*, respectively.82 These values align with calculations based on implicit models. Thermodynamic perspectives and the correlation between COOH* and HCOO* adsorption energies have led to the development of a reaction phase diagram (RPD). The RPD, represented by bold lines, determines the globally optimal limiting free energies. Strongly reactive catalysts favor the COOH* path, while catalysts with relatively weak reactivity prefer the HCOO* path. This analysis indicates a double-peak activity volcano trend due to distinct mechanisms following either the COOH* or HCOO* path.
While it is true that Ni and Sn also display a strong interaction with such intermediates, this intense adsorption can impede the reaction progress due to the difficulty of desorbing the intermediates. On the other hand, metals like Bi, Pb, and Sb, although not depicted in the figure, still exhibit favorable characteristics for formate production.83–86
Researchers have the freedom to utilize diverse tailoring strategies for the fabrication of Sn-based electrocatalysts with a wide range of morphologies, including single-atom catalysts, bimetallic catalysts, Sn-based oxides/sulfides, and other customized structures. These tailored catalysts have exhibited remarkable improvements in terms of faradaic efficiencies and selectivity in the electrochemical CO2RR. In this section, we will delve into the recent advancements in Sn-based nanocatalysts and evaluate their performance in electrochemical CO2RR. Through this exploration, we aim to shed light on the capabilities and accomplishments of Sn-based nanocatalysts, further elucidating their potential in driving efficient and selective CO2 conversion.
3.1. Single-atom catalysts
The concept of single-atom catalysts (SACs), which involve dispersing individual metal atoms as active sites on substrates, has garnered significant attention. SACs offer unique advantages, including the synergistic effects of non-metal atoms, and have been explored in a limited number of catalytic systems. Some examples include the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),87 hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER),88 nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR),89 and others. The SAC has the distinctive advantage compared to bulk metal counterparts owing to its unique electronic structure, which not only can be further regulated easily, but also enables it to maximize the efficiency of atom utilization and therefore increase catalytic activity.11,90–93
The Sn-based single-atom catalysts have also been reported for electrochemical CO2RR. Inspired by the fact that Pyridinic-N doped carbons could play a significant role in combining CO2 and protons, Zhao et al.94 dispersed Sn on N-doped carbon nanofiber (AD-Sn/N-C) atomically and gave insight into the atomic structure of as-prepared catalysts (AD-Sn/N-C1000) by carrying out the aberration-corrected high-angle annual dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM), which suggested that the isolated Sn atoms can be clearly visualized between carbon layers or on the surface of them. Electrochemical results further proved that benefiting from the construction of Sn–N species, which inevitably accelerated the absorption of CO2, such catalysis could present a considerable FE (91%) for CO2–CO conversion as with as lower Tafel slope (140 mV dec−1) and overpotential (490 mV). Interestingly, dispersing Sn catalyst atomically on N-rich carbon matrix (Sn-NOC) is also active for the CO2RR.95 In this work, the as-prepared catalyst could suppress the formation of HCOO*, while lower the required energy for CO production and thus enhancing the CO2RR performance on a specific product, and Sn-NOC electrocatalyst achieved an FE of 94% and CO partial current density of 13.9 mA cm−2. Also in pursuit of production of CO from CO2RR rather than formic acid, Ni et al.96 synthesized a single-atom Sn catalyst with a fluorine atom axially coordinated Sn–C2O2 structure (FNC-SnOF) to catalyze the CO2RR with a FE of 95.2%. DFT calculations mapped out the energy profile of the CO2RR on such catalyst, which suggests that the HER process was suppressed effectively due to the synergistic effect of F atom and S atom, whereas adsorption of intermediate HCOO* could be modulated by C and O coordination. Superior CO2RR performance has been reported for NiSn atomic-pair electrocatalysts (NiSn-APC) nanoarray with FE of 86.1% for formate production, better than its counterparts, Sn-SAC (70.4%) and Ni-SAC (<1%).97 It's should be noted that different from previous reports, where the efficiency of CO2RR were hurdled owing to limited active sites, this work successfully surmounted this key challenge by modifying the electronic structure, where each Ni and Sn atom is surrounded with four nitrogen atoms (N4–Ni–Sn–N4), given by HAADF-STEM and extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS).
The studies mentioned above offer valuable insights into the rational design of single-atom catalysts and their role in enhancing the performance of CO2RR. These investigations contribute to our understanding of how single-atom catalysts can be tailored and optimized to improve their efficiency and selectivity in converting CO2 into value-added products. The findings pave the way for further advancements in the field of CO2 electrocatalysis and offer potential strategies for developing more efficient catalysts for sustainable CO2 utilization.
3.2. Bimetallic catalysts
Metal alloys have garnered significant attention in electrochemical CO2RR due to their distinct advantages over single metal catalysts. Incorporating a secondary metal into an alloy catalyst effectively doubles the number of active sites available for the CO2RR process. This incorporation leads to the reconstruction of the crystal structure, modification of local electron distribution, and alteration of surface adsorption energy, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity. These unique characteristics of metal alloys enable them to outperform their single metal counterparts, making them promising candidates for efficient CO2 conversion. The growing interest in metal alloys highlights their potential in advancing the field of electrochemical CO2RR and promoting the development of highly active and selective catalysts.98–101 As mentioned previously, Cu-based electrocatalysts have shown preeminent activity for converting CO2 into hydrocarbons and alcohols simultaneously. Taking advantage of synergistic effect between Sn and Cu atoms for achieving higher electrochemical CO2RR performances have been reported,102–104 which together with aforementioned points provide a novel perspective on engineering the electronic and geometric effect of Sn-based materials, that is alloying metal Zn and Cu simultaneously. For instance, Sarfraz et al.105 successfully obtained Cu–Sn bimetallic catalyst via electrodeposition method driven by different passing current density followed with annealing under N2, delivering a FE of CO greater than 90% and long-durability, outperforms that its oxide-derived (OD)-Cu counterpart. Interestingly, they also investigated where Sn atoms would occupy on the surface of Cu atom thus could lead to higher electrochemical performances, as shown in Fig. 3a–c, which suggested that Cu atoms at the surface/edge/corner rather in layers below the surface were more prone to being replaced by Sn atoms. Dong et al.106 also fabricated Cu–Sn bimetallic catalyst and found that the electrochemical CO2RR performances on as-prepared catalyst is Sn-thickness dependent, no matter for Cu/Sn catalyst or Cu/patterned Sn catalyst, as shown in Fig. 3d and e, the decrease of faradaic efficiency for CO production was found when gradually increasing the Sn thickness, however, Cu/Sn catalyst with a high Cu/Sn ratio was highly desired for producing HCOOH owing to local galvanic corrosion of bimetallic catalyst, as depicted in Fig. 3f. Additionally, also by using deposition method, Morimoto et al. synthesized Cu–Sn alloy electrode, which presented a FE of 90% for CO production.107 In general, alloying Sn with Cu metal is a promising strategy for CO2 to CO conversion.

Reproduced from ref. 106 with permission from the ACS publication, copyright (2020). 
In addition to Cu metal, alloying Sn with noble metals was also reported to further enhance their CO2RR activities. In 2017, Pd–Sn alloy nanoparticles supported on activated carbon (AC) with a thickness range of 1–5 nm were prepared by a modified wetting chemistry reduction method, exhibiting an extraordinary FE for formic production (nearly 100%).108 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) suggested that SnO2 was generated on the surface of electrocatalyst owing to the strong oxygen affinity of metal Sn, which in turn prevented Pd atoms from being oxidized when Sn is dominant. Therefore, DFT calculations were carried out for granting insight into the possible reaction pathways for different samples, as shown in Fig. 4a–d, which demonstrated that the surface configurations play an indispensable role in designing suitable catalysts for electrochemical CO2RR. In another work, the electrocatalytic behavior of Au–Sn bimetallic nanoparticles for CO2RR process has also been unveiled.109 Notably, selective isotopic labeling and in situ Raman spectroscopy jointly demonstrated the superior catalytic performance of such catalyst than other bimetallic counterparts towards formic acid and CO production simultaneously. Apart from noble metals, alloying Sn with Sb has also been investigated, which attained higher FE of 96.2% for formate production.41 Although it's rather appealing to promote CO2 conversion electrochemically through alloying Sn with different metals, a systematic study on the choice of the second metals has been overlooked. Inspired by this, Zhang et al.110 provided a more complete profile of the Sn-alloy catalysts by introducing 8 metals (Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, Cd and Pd) and inspected which one would be the best. It was found that Cu–Sn bimetallic system would show the highest activity and selectivity for formate, which in agreement with aforementioned studies. In addition, alloying Sn with noble metal Ag could also give a FE of 88.3%, a slight better than Cu–Sn bimetallic system. It should be noted that different from other bimetallic systems, this work utilized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as substrate, which prevented the aggregation of bimetallic nanoparticles, thus further improving the overall FE.

In conclusion, the studies discussed in this review offer valuable insights into the advancement of highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO2RR based on bimetallic systems. These works emphasize the critical role of surface configuration and effective substrate in achieving enhanced CO2RR performance. The findings contribute to the understanding of key factors that influence the catalytic activity and selectivity in CO2RR, providing guidance for the design and development of future electrocatalytic systems. The knowledge gained from these studies paves the way for the realization of efficient and sustainable CO2 conversion technologies.
3.3. Sn-based oxides
As mentioned previously, metal Sn exhibits a strong affinity for oxygen, leading to the formation of Sn-based oxides on the catalyst surface. It is worth noting that Sn-based oxides also show favorable catalytic properties for electrochemical CO2RR. In this section, we will provide a summary of the recent advances in utilizing Sn-based oxides to achieve higher catalytic activities in the CO2RR process. This will encompass a discussion of the strategies employed to enhance the performance of Sn-based oxide catalysts and shed light on the underlying mechanisms that contribute to their improved activity.
In a pioneering study conducted in 2012, researchers investigated the electrocatalytic performance of Sn and its oxide composite material in the CO2RR. The study revealed that the prepared Sn/SnOx catalyst exhibited remarkable enhancements compared to untreated Sn counterparts. The as-prepared Sn/SnOx catalyst demonstrated an impressive up to 8-fold increase in partial current density and a 4-fold increase in faradaic efficiency for the CO2RR process. These results highlighted the crucial role of oxide-derived nanostructures in catalytic systems. This pioneering study shed light on the potential of Sn-based oxide composite materials as highly effective catalysts for CO2RR. The observed improvements in electrocatalytic performance provided valuable insights into the significance of oxide-derived nanostructures in enhancing catalytic activity for CO2 conversion.111 Inspired by this, Huo et al.112 synthesized Cu bundle@SnO composite catalyst with high rough surface via deposition method, as depicted in Fig. 5a. The unique structure ensured more exposed active sites and effectively overcame CO2 mass-transport limits, which jointly benefited the overall CO2 activity, thus such catalyst could deliver high partial current densities (101.2 mA cm−2) and a FE (80.4%) for C1 products. It should be noted that the formation of CO and HCOOH has been greatly facilitated owing to the amorphous SnO species, which efficiently stabled the carbon dioxide radical anion. In 2019, An et al.113 hydrothermally grew on SnO nanosheets Cu foam with doping Bi (Bi–SnO/Cu foam), which displayed a FE of 93% for formic acid production, better than its SnO/Cu foam counterpart. Such catalyst also showed long-term durability for over 30 hours at 12 mA cm−2. Theoretical calculations have revealed that the addition of bismuth (Bi) as a dopant in a catalyst not only improves the selectivity of the desired product but also helps to maintain the stability of trace amounts of divalent tin ions (Sn2+) on the catalyst surface.

In addition to SnO, SnO2 is another representative oxide material belonging to the SnOx family that has been extensively studied. Research conducted by Spurgeon's group has also emphasized the benefits of structure modulation in Sn-based oxides. As illustrated in Fig. 5b and c, acid etching of Sn-based oxides leads to the formation of a high density of grain boundaries, which enhances the number of catalytically active sites and ultimately improves the CO2RR activities. This observation highlights the significance of optimizing the structural characteristics of Sn-based oxides to achieve enhanced catalytic performance in CO2RR.43 In another work, Li et al.44 used two-step process to prepare hierarchical mesoporous SnO2 nanosheets on carbon cloth (SnO2/CC) towards CO2 electrocatalysts (Fig. 5d). Under a current density of 50 mA cm−2, a formate FE of 87 ± 2% was achieved by such catalyst. SnO2/CC also possessed superior stability and flexibility (Fig. 5e and f). The prominent catalytic performances could be ascribed to selecting SnO2 as catalyst coupled with a unique morphology design as well as employing conductive carbon cloth as a substrate. A mesoporous SnO2 nanocatalyst was also shown by Daiyan et al. to be active with a FE 75% for formate generation.114 In addition, modification of SnO2 nanosheets with ultrathin N-doped carbon layers to facilitate the adsorption of CO2 as an electrode has also shown great potential for CO2RR.115 In another reference, W-doped SnO2 nanosheets were prepared via a solvothermal-calcination process.116 The authors found that W incorporation not only narrowed the band gap and reduced work functions of SnO2, but also shifted its p-band center towards the Fermi level. Therefore, the CO2 could fully react on the catalyst surface and the electron transfer process was accelerated, thereby lowering the activation energy barrier for CO2 reduction, and giving rise to much enhanced CO2RR activity for HCOOH production (Fig. 5g).
Apart from SnO2, which proved its potential in target catalytic system, another Sn-based oxide, Sn3O4 is also capable of bettering electrochemical CO2RR, even better than its SnO and SnO2 counterparts owing to distinct decrease of energy barrier when it comes to producing HCOOH, as depicted in Fig. 5h.117 In another work, Wu et al.118 coupling Sn3O4 with SnO2 to further elevate the production rate of formic acid, but in this composite, Sn3O4 still served as the dominant phase. Additionally, SnOx119 and PbSnO3/C120 catalyst also demonstrated its potential in electrochemical CO2RR for producing formate and oxalate, respectively. Moreover, the catalytic performances of SnOx-based materials can be further improved by using conductive substrate and creating oxygen vacancy simultaneously,121 re-designing geometric configuration122,123 and coupling them with other oxide-derived materials.124,125
The aforementioned studies highlight the potential of coupling metal-based oxides with various strategies to further enhance the performance of electrochemical CO2RR. These approaches offer effective means to manipulate the adsorption of CO2 molecules, as well as control the FE values and selectivity of the reaction. By tailoring the composition, structure, and surface properties of metal-based oxides, researchers can achieve improved control over the CO2 adsorption process, leading to enhanced FE and selectivity towards desired products. These findings contribute to the development of innovative strategies for optimizing the electrochemical CO2RR process and provide valuable insights into the design of advanced catalysts for CO2 conversion.
3.4. Sn-based sulfides
As previously mentioned, Sn-based oxide catalysts are widely utilized in CO2RR research. Additionally, sulfides, which are another class of Sn-based derivatives, have also demonstrated exceptional catalytic properties. These Sn-based sulfide catalysts have been extensively investigated and have shown excellent performance in CO2RR. The unique characteristics of Sn-based sulfides, including their electronic and structural properties, contribute to their remarkable catalytic activity. Therefore, sulfides represent another promising avenue for the development of efficient catalysts for CO2RR. For example, the Sargent group reported using atomic layer depositing procedure to prepare compositionally variant sulfur-modulated tin over Au nanoneedles (Sn(S)/Au) as a more efficient catalyst (55 mA cm−2, 93%) due to the fact that when the S content increased, the Gibbs free energy of formation for HCOO*, COOH*, and H* intermediates reduced (Fig. 6a) and the atomic surface area increased, which accelerated the reaction rate and the resulting undercoordinated active Sn sites favored CO2 adsorption.126 Using SnS nanosheets as a CO2RR catalyst, Zou et al. attained a FE of 88 ± 2% with the current density of 120 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH.127 The desirable activities could be attributed to the utilization of alkaline media rather than acid electrolyte and the existence of sulfur, which effectively suppressed the CO evolution and HER process respectively, thus enhancing the conversion of CO2 to formate. Doping is another promising route for better electrochemical CO2RR performances of Sn-based sulfides, for example, doping Cu42 and Ni128 into SnS2 attained a FE of 90.3% and 93%, respectively. In another work, Sn nanoclusters with trace of sulfur doping greatly facilitated the formation of HCOOH.129

Albeit carbon-based materials are electrocatalytically inert for CO2RR, these materials, however, featured with high surface area and conductivity, can be employed as support for our catalysts because in this way, nanocatalysts can be better dispersed and aggregation reduced, and charge transport can also be enhanced.130 Inspired by this, Li et al. hydrothermally grew SnS2 nanosheets on reduced graphene oxide (SnS2/rGO) to catalyze the CO2RR, affording amazing performance metrics (13.9 mA cm−2, 84.5%), as shown in Fig. 6b.131 Besides, a much smaller Tafel slope was achieved (Fig. 6c), which indicated that the CO2RR activity served as the dominant rather than HER. Notably, these results evidence the Sn-based sulfides as effective catalysts for electrochemical CO2RR.
3.5. Other types of catalysts

3.5.1. Core–shell structure. 
The core–shell structure comprises two components: a metallic core, which provides high electrical conductivity, and a thin shell, either metallic or partially oxidized. This combination enables the achievement of high electrocatalytic activity while allowing for easy modification. Inspired by this, Luc et al.132 prepared core–shell electrocatalysts with an Ag–Sn bimetallic core and a partially oxidized SnOx shell for optimal CO2RR activity and the synthetic method can be clearly visualized in Fig. 7a. The authors found that the activity and product distribution of CO2 electroreduction were linked to the shell thickness, specifically, when the thickness of SnOx shell increased, a FE decreased, and an optimal FE of 80% for formate production and reasonable Tafel slope of 110 mV dec−1 were achieved when SnOx shell thickness was 1.7 nm. Besides, DFT calculations indicated that oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the SnO (101) surface played an important role in activating CO2 because its stability at highly negative potentials as well as its favorability for two intermediates for the HCOOH and CO formation pathways, OCHO* and COOH*, respectively (Fig. 7b and c). The same idea was followed by Li et al.,133 where the product selectivity via CO2 electroduction was also dependent on the thickness of as-prepared Cu/SnO2 nanoparticles. In detail, the CO was the major product with a FE of 93% when the shell was ultrathin (0.8 nm), however, while gradually increasing the thickness of such shell (1.8 nm), the production of formate became dominant. Impressively, high-performance CO2RR catalysis can also be enabled over 3D core–shell porous-structured Cu@Sn hybrid electrodes due to the large specific surface area with abundant active sites (a FE of 100% and a partial current density of 16.52 mA cm−2).134 More recently, Xing et al.135 reported Bi@Sn core–shell structure to ameliorate the CO2RR. The morphology of such catalysis is depicted in Fig. 7d and e. DFT calculations suggested that this core–shell, which possessed the compressive strain in the Sn shell, lower the energy barrier of the potential-limiting step for the formation of HCOOH and effectively prohibiting the formation of CO simultaneously, thus contributing to a higher catalytical performances (Fig. 7f and g). In general, these findings provide valuable insights into the rational design of core–shell structured catalysts for achieving highly efficient CO2RR activity.

3.5.2. Sn dendrite. 
Recent studies have confirmed that constructing sharp spikes on material surfaces can significantly enhance the local electric field, thereby promoting the electroreduction of molecules near the tip regions. This effective approach has demonstrated promising results in the rational synthesis of CO2RR electrocatalysts with abundant active sites.136 Strikingly, dendritic structured electrocatalysts have been reported in various electrocatalytic systems,37,38,137,138 which jointly offer a promising way to rationally fabricate Sn-based materials with higher catalytical activity. Notably, Won et al.139 prepared a series of Sn dendrite electrodes with large surface area and high porosity for optimal CO2RR activity via a simple electrodeposition method. The main product obtained in the CO2RR is formate. It should be noted that heat-treatment procedure did not affect the original morphology of Sn electrode (Fig. 8a and b) but resulted in the formation of a trace amount of O species, which stabilize the key intermediate species during reaction pathways, thus affording a much higher FE and lower Tafel slope than its Sn foil and Sn dendrite counterparts (Fig. 8c and d).

4. Summary and outlook
Renewable electricity-powered CO2 reduction offers an attractive pathway to mitigate excess atmospheric CO2 and create a highly sustainable ecosystem for future generations. However, the widespread implementation of this sustainable technology requires the development of durable, efficient, environmentally friendly, and noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for aqueous electrochemical CO2 reduction. Notably, Sn-based electrocatalysts have garnered significant attention in this field due to their exceptional advantages such as economic viability, low toxicity, and environmental friendliness. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of recent advances in Sn-based electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2RR, delving into the fundamental mechanisms of this intricate reaction. Furthermore, we present a systematic review of strategies aimed at enhancing the catalytic performance of Sn-based electrocatalysts, encompassing categories such as single-atom catalysts, bimetallic catalysts, Sn-based oxides, Sn-based sulfides, as well as other types of catalysts including core–shell structures and dendritic Sn. Table 2 covers the details of the performance parameters of Sn-based CO2RR electrocatalysts, which in agreement with that the great advancements have been achieved in such aqueous catalytic system based on Sn and its derivate materials.

Despite the significant achievements made thus far, the journey from catalyst development to practical device implementation is still a long one, and several challenges persist. These challenges have sparked intense discussions among researchers as they strive to develop effective strategies to overcome them. (1) Various types of synthetic methods so far have been proposed for synthesizing Sn-based materials, however, how to control the size of as-prepared nanomaterials remains further exploration. As discussed previously, considering the catalytic performance is occasional thickness-dependent, decreasing the thickness of such nanocatalyst will lead to the increase of FE, hence, it is rational to expect that proper electrode preparation protocols that can simultaneously optimize the size of nanocatalysts, the performance, and long-term durability of the half-cell electrode, with design transferable to devices will be reported in the future. In the Section 3.2, we state that Sn is often coupled with the secondary metals to form alloy with excellent properties, which suggests that the appropriate composition of the catalyst is one of the most important preconditions for higher catalytic activity. Therefore, it is very useful to give deep insight into the optimized composition and how such composition is formed while alloying Sn with different metals. Additionally, not only bringing the secondary metal, alloying Sn with two other metals, three other metals or numerous metals also deserves much attention. Nevertheless, we should shine a spotlight on the utilization efficiency of the noble metals because the high cost and insufficient supply obstruct their large-scale applications. (3) In the last section, we have reviewed the morphologies effect of Sn-based materials for efficient CO2RR like core–shell structure and dendritic Sn, these unique structures not only can provide abundant active sites owing to large specific surface area, but also facilitate the interactions between electrocatalysts and reactants. Note that these advantages play a key role in improving electrocatalytical performance, thus it is meaningful to explore Sn-based catalysts with a well-defined morphology and a tunable nanoporous structure, especially for dendritic Sn. (4) Selecting conductive support such as graphene represents a promising modified method since these materials not only can enable the electrons to be transferred more quickly thus leading to higher conductivity, but also prevent the nanoparticles from aggregation. However, graphene is intrinsically inert for CO2RR, which evidences that pursuing other supporting materials is highly desired. For example, carbon nanotubes (CNT), which have already been proposed for supporting Sn-based catalysts to achieve desirable catalytic performances in several publications.140–142 Apart from this, 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene, which possess the high conductivity and large surface area143 as well as its intrinsic CO2RR activity,144–146 can also be employed as substrate for or coupled with Sn-based catalysts. (5) Generally, the experiment in the laboratory is conducted in a typical H-type cell, however, the poor solubility of CO2 in electrolyte largely hinders the current density, which drives researchers to pursue different reactors that can effectively deal with this drawback. Besides, developing reactors that can meet practical applications and produce high-purity products with easily controlled concentrations is highly desired. (6) Similar to point 5, testing the catalytic performances of Sn-based catalysts under different conditions such as electrolyte with different pH is also necessary. (7) As was mentioned up front, electrochemical CO2RR is a complex reaction involving multiple-electrons transfer, which underscores the requirement of in situ analysis such as XPS, XAS, Raman, DEMS, FTIR etc. to clearly understand the intermediate species during the reaction pathways. Notably, the use of these approaches has been summarized by pawar et al.147 (8) Also, DFT calculations represent another promising method for fabricating ideal electrocatalysts with well-designed structure, the adsorption energy and volcano pots derived from such theoretical calculations help researchers clearly understand the basic mechanism of such complex reaction. Accordingly, combing theoretical calculations and experiments as well as aforementioned in situ techniques will provide us with a holistic guidance on designing idea electrocatalysts with high activity and sensitivity. (9) Combing electrochemical and photochemical simultaneously to promote CO2 transformation is another trend in the following years.148–150 (10) Formic acid is a versatile and renewable building block that can participate in diverse chemical processes, offering potential advantages in terms of atom economy, sustainability, and mild reaction conditions, such as carbon–nitrogen coupling, C–C bond formation, hydrogenation reactions, redox reactions and energy storage. (11) The ongoing research on Sn-based catalysts for CO2RR is predominantly limited to laboratory-scale investigations. Hence, it is essential to focus on promoting the practical and industrial utilization of these catalysts.
