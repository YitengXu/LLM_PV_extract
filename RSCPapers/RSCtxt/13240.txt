    , Accepted 6th May 2016First published on 6th May 2016AbstractWe fabricated perovskite solar cells with enhanced device efficiency based on vertically oriented TiO2 nanostructures using a nanoporous template of block copolymers (BCPs). The dimension and shape controllability of the nanopores of the BCP template allowed for the construction of one-dimensional (1-D) TiO2 nanorods and two-dimensional (2-D) TiO2 nanowalls. The TiO2 nanorod-based perovskite solar cells showed a more efficient charge separation and a lower charge recombination, leading to better performance compared to TiO2 nanowall-based solar cells. The best solar cells employing 1-D TiO2 nanorods showed an efficiency of 15.5% with VOC = 1.02 V, JSC = 20.0 mA cm−2 and fill factor = 76.1%. Thus, TiO2 nanostructures fabricated from BCP nanotemplates could be applied to the preparation of electron transport layers for improving the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been considered as promising light harvesting materials for next-generation solar cells.1,2 The Miyasaka group first utilized organolead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = I−, Br−, Cl−, or mixed halides) as an inorganic sensitizer for the preparation of dye-sensitized type solar cells (DSSCs) with liquid electrolytes, and obtained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8% using CH3NH3PbI3.3 Subsequently, the Park group reported solid junction perovskite solar cells with an improved efficiency of 6.5% with enhanced long-term stability.4 Since then, the PCE of perovskite solar cells has dramatically increased to 22%.5 The superb photovoltaic performances of perovskite materials as light harvesters originate from their unique characteristics, such as high light-absorption coefficient, long-range balanced carrier-diffusion length, high crystallinity, and excellent charge-carrier mobility.6–14 Moreover, perovskite solar cells can be prepared by simple and low-cost solution processes, which is advantageous for large-scale production.15–18
The randomly packed TiO2 nanoparticulate films constructed on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass substrates have been used as the electron transport layer (ETL) and scaffold layer of perovskite solar cells. However, these films would accompany two issues such as poor pore filling of the light absorber and a labyrinthine carrier transport pathway. To address these issues, perpendicularly oriented TiO2 nanostructures as an ETL have been suggested to provide a direct pathway for efficient charge transport and facilitate pore filling of the perovskite layer.19–22 It has been reported that one-dimensional (1-D) TiO2 nanostructures could induce efficient charge transport and low charge recombination, leading to high performance.23–26 Recently, the Li group demonstrated perovskite solar cells using oriented TiO2 nanocones exhibiting a PCE as high as 12%.27 Jose and co-workers also reported a perovskite solar module (PCE 10.5%) employing solution-grown TiO2 nanorods as an ETL.28 Such well aligned TiO2 nanostructures could be constructed by numerous fabrication methods including sol–gel, electrochemical anodizing, electrospinning, metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), hydrothermal synthesis and block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly methods.29–34 Among them, the block copolymer self-assembly method has been extensively investigated to fabricate nanodevices employing one-dimensional or two-dimensional nanostructures.35,36 Using block copolymer nanostructures as lithographic masks or templates, various nanostructures of metals, semiconductors, and oxides have been successfully demonstrated, for example TiO2 nanostructures such as nanoporous TiO2 was fabricated by a sol–gel process and CF4 etching of TiO2 layers with a block copolymer mask.34,37 TiO2 nanorods were also fabricated by a sol–gel process on a polymeric nanotemplate, which was obtained by etching a polymer film with a block copolymer mask.38 In the case of block copolymer templates, various well-aligned TiO2 nanostructures were fabricated by incorporating TiO2 precursors into the nanostructures of copolymers and calcining them at a high temperature.39 Further, TiO2 nanorods and nanowalls prepared from self-assembly of BCP have been reported as promising candidates for optoelectronics applications including solar cells, energy storage devices, and sensors because they can provide increased surface area and quantum confinement because of the nanoscale geometry.40
In this study, we demonstrated high efficiency perovskite solar cells based on perpendicularly oriented TiO2 nanostructures from a block copolymer nanotemplate. The morphology of the as-prepared TiO2 nanostructures on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass can be controlled by changing the molecular weight and block ratio of the block copolymers. Then, vertically aligned and open porous TiO2 nanostructures were employed as an ETL in perovskite solar cells, which allowed us to obtain a direct pathway for charge transfer as well as better infiltration of perovskite absorbers. The effect of TiO2 nanostructures on the photovoltaic properties of solar cells was compared.
Experimental section
Fabrication of a compact TiO2 layer
Patterned FTO glass (TEC8, Pilkington) was cleaned by sonication in ethanol, acetone, and 2-propanol, followed by UV-ozone treatment for 20 min. The compact TiO2 layer was coated on the FTO glass by spin-coating the TiO2 precursor containing titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (75 wt% in isopropanol, Sigma-Aldrich) mixed with 1-butanol at 2000 rpm for 40 s, followed by pre-heating at 125 °C for 10 min and heat treating at 500 °C for 30 min.
Fabrication of nanoporous templates and TiO2 nanostructures
BCPs of polystyrene-poly(methylmethacrylate), PS(46)-PMMA(21) and PS(80)-PMMA(80) were purchased from Polymer Source, Inc. The number in the parenthesis is the average molecular weight (Mn) in kg mol−1. The polydispersity index (PDI) is 1.09 for each BCP. A random copolymer of poly(styrene-r-methylmethacrylate-r-vinylbenzocyclobutene), P(S-r-MMA-r-VBC) (56 mol% S, 42 mol% MMA, 2 mol% VBC, Mn = 45 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.25) was also purchased for surface neutralization. To make the neutral surface necessary for the perpendicular nanodomains of PS-PMMA, we modified the surface of the compact TiO2 layer with P(S-r-MMA-r-VBC) as described in the literature. A film of PS-PMMA with a thickness of ∼200 nm on the neutralized surface was spin-coated (typically at 4000 rpm for 60 s) from a toluene solution of PS-PMMA (4.0 to 5.0 wt%). The film was then annealed in solvent vapor and thermally annealed at 230 °C for 4 h in a vacuum to induce perpendicular nanodomains of PS-PMMA. Then, the nanodomains of the PMMA block were selectively removed with UV irradiation (254 nm, 15 W) for 2 h, followed by washing with acetic acid and water at room temperature, resulting in a nanoporous template on the compact TiO2 layer. The same procedure was applied to PS(46)-PMMA(21) and PS(80)-PMMA(80). TiO2 nanorods and nanowalls were synthesized from nanoporous templates, which were fabricated on the compact TiO2 layer using BCP films. First, the nanoporous templates were exposed to oxygen plasma (40 mTorr, 80 W) for 3 s, which made the templates hydrophilic. Then, the nanoporous template was coated with a 0.8 M isopropanol solution of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP, Sigma-Aldrich, 97%) containing 2.2 M hydrochloric acid using a KSV dip-coater (85 mm min−1 dipping, 10 mm min−1 withdrawing), followed by drying, removal of the TTIP solution on the FTO back side, and heating at 500 °C for 30 min in air to obtain TiO2 nanorods and nanowalls after removal of the template. Before heating, the over-coated layer was eliminated by CF4 reactive ion etching (RIE).
Device fabrication
For the perovskite layer, PbI2 (500 mg, Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (1 ml, DMF, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) was spin-coated on top of the nanostructured TiO2 layer. The PbI2-coated electrode was sequentially spin-coated with a methylammonium iodide (10 mg, CH3NH3I) solution in 2-propanol (1 ml, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) and then heated to 80 °C for 20 min, resulting in the formation of a dark brown perovskite film. We used a hole transport material (HTM) composed of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-p-dimethoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (56 mg, spiro-OMeTAD, Merck), 4-tert-butylpyridine (30 mg, Aldrich, 96%), and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (5.8 mg, LiTFSI, Aldrich, 99.95%) in anhydrous chlorobenzene (1 ml, Aldrich, 99.8%). After coating the HTM solution, the Au electrode (80 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation. The metal electrodes were deposited using shadow masks to define the active area. The active area of each device (0.1–0.15 cm2) was measured using an optical microscope.
Characterization
The morphology and thickness of the films were examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4300). Pt coating on a sample was performed when it was necessary. The absorbance of the perovskite films was measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda 35). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Rigaku Ultima IV. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley model 2400 source measurement unit and a solar simulator equipped with a 1000 W xenon lamp (Yamashida Denso, YSS-50S) and a KG-3 filter. A Si solar cell calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) was used to adjust the light intensity to the AM 1.5G 1 sun condition (100 mW cm−2). During all J–V measurements, non-reflective black masks were attached to the devices to exclude diffused light scattering. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a K3100 EQX spectral IPCE measurement system. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite films were obtained by excitation at 460 nm using a Fluorolog3 photoluminescence spectrometer system with a monochromator (iHR320, HORIBA Scientific). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) measurements were performed at the PL maxima of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite (770 nm), using time-correlated single photon counting module (TCSPC, MPD-PDM Series DET-40 photon counting detector and Pendulum CNT-91 frequency counter) combined with a monochromator as the detector, and a second-harmonic generated 400 nm laser as the excitation source derived from 800 nm Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai, Spectra-Physics). To obtain the transient photovoltage, the laser pulse (λ = 532 nm, pulse duration = 7 ns, LCS-DTL-314QT, Laser-Export) was irradiated from the counter electrode side, while the bias light (Coherent, LabLaser, λ = 635 nm) was illuminated from the working electrode side.
Results and discussion
The self-assembling properties of BCPs can provide nanoporous templates for one-dimensional or two-dimensional nanofabrication.35,36,40 Owing to the macroscopically ordered nanoscale morphology, BCP nanotemplates have been mostly used for various nanoscale devices. As shown in Fig. 1, we first fabricated nanoporous templates on FTO/compact TiO2 layers using BCPs of PS-PMMA. Then, vertically aligned TiO2 nanorods and nanowalls were synthesized from the nanoporous templates. Perovskite solar cells were fabricated using TiO2 nanostructures as the ETL of the devices. The main configuration of the devices was FTO/compact TiO2 layer/TiO2 nanostructures/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au. Each layer is well defined, as shown in the SEM cross-sectional image (Fig. S1†). The detailed procedures are explained in the Experimental section.

To confirm the vertical orientation of nanoporous templates, FE-SEM experiments were performed. The FE-SEM images in Fig. 2 show nanoporous templates on the FTO/TiO2 compact layer, which were fabricated from PS(46)-PMMA(21) and PS(80)-PMMA(80).41–44 In Fig. 2a, we can observe the nanopores in a close-packed hexagonal array, which are perpendicularly oriented and well established from the top to the bottom of the template (∼200 nm thickness) as shown in the inset of a side-view image. The average diameter and the center-to-center spacing of the nanopores were 15 nm and 35 nm, respectively. In the case of PS(80)-PMMA(80), which forms lamellar nanodomains, a template with nanogrooves in a finger-printed pattern was obtained, as shown in Fig. 2b. The average width of the nanogrooves was 45 nm with a spacing of 25 nm. The side-view image in the inset of Fig. 2b shows a nanogroove template with a thickness of ∼200 nm.

Fig. 3 shows the FE-SEM images of TiO2 nanostructures fabricated from the nanoporous templates shown in Fig. 2. In the top-view image of Fig. 3a, we can observe the tops of hexagonally packed nanorods. The well-aligned and perpendicularly oriented nanorods were confirmed by the side-view image. The average nanorod diameter and the center-to-center distance between adjacent nanorods were 17 nm and 35 nm, respectively. Thus, each nanopore of the template produced one TiO2 nanorod so that the control over nanorods was achieved using the template. The height of the nanorods (∼120 nm) is smaller than the thickness of the template (∼200 nm) because of RIE used for the removal of the over-coated layer and densification by calcination. The nanowall structure was also synthesized from the nanogroove template (Fig. 2b). In the top-view image of Fig. 3b, the top parts of the TiO2 nanowalls in the fingerprint pattern are visible. The average width and the spacing of the nanowalls were 25 nm and 45 nm, respectively. We note that the TiO2 nanowalls synthesized from the nanogroove template are not perfectly vertical but slightly tilted, presumably because of the irregularity of both spacing and width of the PS nanogroove template. The side-view image in the inset of Fig. 3b shows TiO2 nanowalls with heights of 100 nm. Hence, these results demonstrate that the final morphology of the TiO2 nanostructures with vertical orientation on the FTO/compact TiO2 layer can be effectively controlled by nanoporous templates produced from self-assembled BCP thin films.

The crystalline structure of the TiO2 nanostructures on FTO glass was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. We fabricated anatase crystalline TiO2 nanostructures from the nanoporous templates by annealing at 500 °C in air, which resulted in the generation of the anatase crystalline TiO2 nanostructures and the complete removal of the BCP nanotemplates. The sharp peaks at 25.3° in Fig. 4 are the main characteristic anatase TiO2 peaks (101), indicating that the as-prepared TiO2 nanostructures have an anatase phase.19,45

The as-prepared TiO2 nanostructures from BCP nanotemplates were loaded with perovskite absorbers using the sequential deposition method for perovskite solar cells.46,47 It is critical to form perovskite layers with full coverage and smooth surfaces. An incomplete coverage of the perovskite film results in low shunt resistance and low light absorption in the solar cell.48 In the top-view SEM images in Fig. S2a,† no TiO2 nanorods can be observed, indicating a smooth surface with compact grains and full coverage of the perovskite capping layer. However, when we observe the SEM image of TiO2 nanowalls/perovskite, pinholes appear frequently in the perovskite capping layer, as marked by the dashed white circles as shown in Fig. S2b.†
We fabricated perovskite solar cells based on the TiO2 nanostructures using BCP nanotemplates. The J–V characteristics of the best-performing device based on the TiO2 nanostructures are shown in Fig. 5a. To clearly compare the photovoltaic performance of the TiO2 nanorods and nanowalls, the individual photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The best device based on TiO2 nanorods showed the highest PCE of 15.5% with VOC of 1.02 V, JSC of 20.0 mA cm−2, and a remarkably high FF of 76.1%. In contrast, the best device based on TiO2 nanowalls showed a PCE of 12.6% with VOC of 1.00 V, JSC of 17.6 mA cm−2, and FF of 71.7%. These results indicate that TiO2 nanostructures using block copolymer templates satisfy the prerequisite for a desirable ETL in perovskite solar cells. Fig. 5b shows the high and broad incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) over the entire spectral range of visible light. The integrated JSC values for TiO2 nanorods and nanowalls calculated from the IPCE spectrum under AM 1.5G photon flux are 19.0 and 15.7 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in agreement with the JSC measured in the J–V curves (20.0 and 17.6 mA cm−2, respectively). We also checked light scattering effects of the TiO2 nanorod and nanowall electrodes whether the different nanostructures influenced the light absorption of perovskite films or not. We investigated reflectance of each nanostructured TiO2 film using UV-Vis spectroscopy and we found that there is no big difference between reflectance of the TiO2 nanorods and nanowalls (Fig. S3a†). Therefore, we suggest that the higher JSC and IPCE obtained from the TiO2 nanorods is attributed to the higher loading of the perovskite absorbers as shown in Fig. S3b.†49

To check the reproducibility of the results of the perovskite solar cells based on the TiO2 nanostructures, we fabricated and measured 20 individual devices. As shown in the histogram in Fig. S4,† the devices prepared from the TiO2 nanorods show better reproducibility and performance. The average PCE of the TiO2 nanorods (14.3%) is higher than the TiO2 nanowalls (10.3%) and the efficiency improvement is mainly attributed to the enhanced VOC, JSC, and FF, as shown in Table S1.†
Hysteresis between the J–V curves obtained from different scan directions is an anomalous phenomenon in the perovskite solar cells. To confirm the reliability and accuracy of our results, we measured the J–V curves of the device based on TiO2 nanostructures at different scan directions as shown in Fig. S5.† The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table S2.† A small hysteresis between the forward and reverse scans is observed in both devices. This small hysteresis can be further reduced by controlling the crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite layer, as previously reported.50–52
To compare the charge transfer behavior and charge recombination at the interface between the perovskite and TiO2 nanostructures, we measured the steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL).27,53Fig. 6a and b display the steady state and time-resolved PL spectra, respectively, of the three samples, glass/perovskite, glass/TiO2 nanorods/perovskite, and glass/TiO2 nanowalls/perovskite. As shown in Fig. 6a, the PL intensities of the TiO2 nanorods and nanowalls/perovskite systems were noticeably reduced compared to the neat perovskite. In particular, the most significant PL quenching was observed for TiO2 nanorods/perovskite systems, indicating the effective charge extraction from perovskite to TiO2 nanorods before recombination. The decay process with time was also evaluated by fitting the measured TR-PL spectra with a bi-exponential decay function (I(t) = A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2) containing fast and slow decay processes. Subscripts 1 and 2 stand for the fast and slow process, respectively. τ and A denote the decay time constant and the degree of contribution for the corresponding process, respectively. The fast decay process originates from the quenching of the excited electron transfer from the perovskite to the TiO2 nanostructures, and the slow decay process is related to the radiative decay of the excited electron back to the ground state of the perovskite.54 For neat perovskite on glass, the decay lifetime is 19.7 ns, which is in good agreement with previous reports (19.5 ns).55 A rapid decay was observed when perovskite was deposited on the TiO2 nanostructures, as shown in Fig. 6b and Table 2. Smaller τ1 and larger A1 can be interpreted as fast charge extraction from the excited electrons in the perovskite into TiO2, and its contribution to the total quenching process, respectively. Therefore, smaller τ1 and larger A1 are desirable for better performance. Compared to systems without the TiO2 nanostructure system, shorter τ1 and larger A1 values were obtained for the TiO2 nanostructure/perovskite system. Interestingly, the TiO2 nanorods/perovskite system showed a much faster decay (τ1 ∼ 2.9 ns) and a larger contribution of the charge extraction process compared to others, suggesting that the TiO2 nanorods could lead to effective charge extraction from excited electrons in the perovskite because of the largest surface-to-volume ratio originated from the one-dimensional morphology.54 This result also accounts for the significantly improved JSC and FF in the TiO2 nanorod-based perovskite solar cell by enhancement of the charge separation and suppression of the radiative charge recombination.56

To further compare the charge recombination behavior between TiO2 nanostructures, we performed transient photovoltage analysis.57,58 As shown in Fig. 7, the TiO2 nanorods exhibit a slightly longer charge recombination lifetime of 5.5 μs under our experimental conditions, while it was 3.3 μs for the TiO2 nanowalls. The morphology of the TiO2 nanowalls does not seem very homogeneous because the TiO2 precursor solution was infiltrated into the poorly aligned PS nanogroove domains. The faster charge recombination of TiO2 nanowalls might be associated with incomplete infiltration and coverage of the perovskite on the TiO2 nanostructures.59,60 Consequently, relatively poor performances were obtained such as lower VOC, FF, and inferior PCE, as summarized in Table S1.† Furthermore, pinholes in the TiO2 nanowalls/perovskite, as shown in Fig. S2b,† might increase the possibility of shunt paths, resulting in severe recombination of electrons in the TiO2 nanowalls with holes in spiro-OMeTAD.61 Unlike TiO2 nanowall-based perovskite solar cells, the perpendicularly oriented TiO2 nanorods have effective nanostructures that can act as scaffolds in the perovskite solar cells as a result of the full coverage perovskite capping layers, thus, accounting for the suppressed charge recombination and the best photovoltaic performance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated highly efficient perovskite solar cells using vertically oriented TiO2 nanostructures from a template with cylindrical nanopores and nanogrooves. The block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly method was developed to fabricate well-ordered TiO2 nanostructures on FTO glass. The control over the morphology of BCP nanotemplates was enabled by changing the molecular weights of the BCPs, which allowed for the adjustment of TiO2 nanostructures as an ETL for perovskite solar cells. The TiO2 nanorods enhanced the charge transfer compared to the nanowalls, which exhibited higher PL quenching efficiency with faster TR-PL decay. The charge recombination lifetime value in the TiO2 nanorod-based perovskite solar cell is slightly longer than that in the nanowall-based perovskite solar cell. The vertically aligned TiO2 nanorod-based perovskite solar cell exhibited a maximum PCE as high as 15.5%. This is the highest efficiency reported to date for perovskite solar cells based on 1-D TiO2 nanorods as an ETL. The results suggest that perpendicularly oriented TiO2 nanostructures fabricated from BCP nanotemplates are promising as an ETL and a nanostructured scaffold.
