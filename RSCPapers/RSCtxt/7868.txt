    , Accepted 11th December 2019First published on 11th December 2019AbstractHalide perovskites have attracted great attention owing to their outstanding performance in optoelectronic applications and solar cells. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) Cs3Sb2I9 nanocrystals (NCs) have attracted sustained interest due to their potentially useful photovoltaic behavior. However, their practical application is impeded by the large bandgap. In this study, the bandgap of 2D Cs3Sb2I9 NCs is successfully narrowed from 2.05 eV to 1.36 eV by means of a high pressure with a measurable rate of 33.7%. Optical changes of 2D Cs3Sb2I9 NCs originate from Sb–I bond contraction and I–Sb–I bond angle changes within the [SbI6]3− octahedra, which determines the overlap of orbitals. Angle dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction spectra and Raman spectra of Cs3Sb2I9 NCs indicate that the structural amorphization gradually begins at about 14.0 GPa and the changes are reversible once pressure is completely released. The band gap is slightly smaller after decompression than that under the initial ambient conditions, resulting from the incomplete recrystallization process. First-principles calculations further elucidate that variations in band gaps are mainly governed by the orbital interactions associated with the distortion of the Sb–I octahedral network upon compression. The research enhances the fundamental understanding of 2D Cs3Sb2I9 NCs and is expected to greatly advance the research progress of perovskites in band gap interception at high pressures. Meanwhile, this study demonstrates that pressure processing can be used as a robust strategy to improve materials-by-design in applications.
Introduction
The needs of the future generation depend heavily on the access to cheap and abundant energy. The photovoltaic effect is a very appropriate energy conversion process, which has potential to meet this requirement. In the past few years, halide perovskites (HPs) have sparked intense research attention because of their excellent performance and prospects in photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications.1–7 Lead halide perovskites as typical representatives of halide perovskites has gained an important position in light-absorbing candidates owing to their outstanding physical properties.8,9 Jiang et al. have successfully increased the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells to 23.32% by means of surface defect passivation, reducing defects and suppressing non-radiative recombination.10 However, lead halide perovskites still face two main problems in the development and application of perovskite photovoltaic technology. The first one is the low stability. Various ideas have been proposed to enhance the stability, and it has been partly solved by replacing the organic part with cesium ions.11 The second problem is the high toxicity of lead, which has hindered the wide application of perovskites.5 It is greatly necessary to replace the lead in perovskite materials with lead-free metals for their commercialization. Purely inorganic 2D HPs Cs3Sb2I9 materials as alternatives to Pb have recently evoked considerable attention because of their improved air stability and excellent optical properties.12 Moreover, the 2D layered form of Cs3Sb2I9 (space group Pm1) is more suitable than the 0D form (P63/mmc) for photovoltaic applications, owing to the nearly direct band gap of the 2D structure.13 However, actual photovoltaics require perovskites to meet the demand of the band gap approaching the Shockley–Queisser limit. Therefore, the practical application of 2D HPs Cs3Sb2I9 materials is severely impeded by their large band gap. It is thus highly desirable to explore an effective method to achieve the band gap regulation. Furthermore, it is urgent to elucidate the fundamental understanding of the structure–property relationship for 2D Cs3Sb2I9 materials.
Pressure, as a “clean” and effective method, is successfully used to tailor the crystal structures and physical properties without changing the chemical composition.14,15 Previous high pressure works on 2D materials provide strategies for phase engineering of nanostructures and alternative tools for the design and fabrication of advanced functional materials with controlled mesostructures and enhanced or newly manifested anisotropic properties.16–18 Some studies also reported that 2D (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 [(BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1, n = 1, 2, 3, 4] perovskites exhibit an enduring band gap narrowing by as much as 8.2% with stability under pressure and that the electronic band of 2D layered perovskite-like CsPb2Br5 exhibits a linear narrowing by 0.03 eV from the initial 2.37 eV at relatively low pressure.19 Although they all achieved the pressure-induced band gap narrowing, the narrowing band gap fails to meet the demand of the band gap approaching the Shockley–Queisser limit.20–25 Liu et al. explored the band gap changes of FAPbI3 [NH2CHNH2 (FA)] by using high pressure.26 However, the band gap monotonic narrowing was obtained only within a specific pressure range. Meanwhile, the lead in FAPbBr3 and FAPbI3 would hinder their wide application owing to its high toxicity.
Here, we investigated the optical properties of 2D lead-free perovskites Cs3Sb2I9 nanocrystals (NCs) by using a diamond anvil cell (DAC). Importantly, the band gap of Cs3Sb2I9 NCs was narrowed from 2.05 eV to 1.36 eV under pressure without any structural transformation. With the assistance of low-temperature or high-speed quenching, the high pressure phase is expected to be quenched to ambient conditions, which will expand the material scope with promising applications in the field of photovoltaics. This pressure-triggered highly adjustable absorption with a 690 meV red-shift was attributed to the structural compression behavior in 2D halide perovskites. Meanwhile, the band gap variation of Cs3Sb2I9 NCs exhibited an almost linear relationship with pressure, which makes Cs3Sb2I9 NCs have potential application in pressure sensing. The band gap is slightly smaller after decompression than that under the initial ambient conditions, which originates from the incomplete recrystallization process. By correlating with in situ high-pressure X-ray diffraction and Raman results, we examine successfully the relationship between the structural change and properties of 2D Cs3Sb2I9 NCs. The crystal structure of Cs3Sb2I9 NCs with the space group Pm1 is maintained until the pressure increases to approximately 14.0 GPa, the broad diffraction background, and peak weakening indicates that amorphization gradually occurred.27,28 Moreover, first-principles calculations further elucidate that the reduction of Sb–I bond lengths and I–Sb–I bond angles upon compression enhances the electron cloud overlap between the Sb and I orbitals, leading to the narrowing band gap. Our findings demonstrate that pressure processing can be used as a robust strategy to deepen the understanding of the structure–property relationship in 2D halide perovskites under extreme conditions.
Results and discussion
HPs Cs3Sb2I9 crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal structure with the space group Pm1, and the lattice parameters of Cs3Sb2I9 are a = b = 8.2971(0) Å, c = 10.3145(0) Å and α = β = 90°, γ = 120° (Fig. 1a and b). Within the lattice, eight Cs+ ions occupy the eight corners of the unit cell and two other Cs+ ions reside in the body diagonal of the unit cell. The unit cell consists of two [SbI6]3− octahedra where each octahedron is connected to other three octahedra by sharing three cis vertices and leading to 2D layered Cs3Sb2I9 NCs (Fig. 1c). In the unit cell, each Sb atom occupies 2/3 of the octahedral SbI6 voids and the angle Sb–I–Sb is 180°. Cs3Sb2I9 NCs were prepared by employing the hot injection method (details were provided in the Experimental section). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Cs3Sb2I9 NCs is shown in Fig. S1.† The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shows fringe spacing values of 0.35 nm corresponding to (003) planes of 2D Cs3Sb2I9 NCs.

In order to track the band gap evolution, in situ UV/vis absorption experiments were performed on the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs under compression. The absorption spectra upon compression are shown in Fig. 2a. Under ambient conditions, the band gap of the synthesized Cs3Sb2I9 NCs is about 606 nm. As the pressure increased to about 20.0 GPa, the absorption edge experienced a gradual red-shift to 911 nm. The absorption edge exhibits a 305 nm wide range of movement with increasing pressure from 1 atm to 20.0 GPa. Tauc plots applying to the indirect band gap of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs are also implemented to determine the band gap changes of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs with increasing pressure. As shown in Fig. 2b, the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs exhibit a band gap of 2.05 eV under ambient conditions. Upon compression, the band gap of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs undergoes a continuously noticeable reduction process from 2.05 eV to 1.36 eV, demonstrating a flexible bandgap tunability in the 2D perovskites Cs3Sb2I9 NCs, even without any chemical modification (Fig. S2†). When the pressure reaches ∼2.0 GPa, the absorption edge shows a relatively slow red-shift. Importantly, the narrowed band gap is approaching the Shockley–Queisser limit. When the pressure is in the range of 14.0 to 20.0 GPa, the absorption edge shows a continuous red-shift. The band gap increases with the release of the pressure (Fig. S3†). Upon the complete release of the pressure, the band gap is slightly smaller than at the initial state (Fig. S4†), which should be related to the incomplete recrystallization process. This extraordinary piezochromic transition of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs is evidently observed through optical micrographs (Fig. 2c).

(c) Optical micrograph of Cs3Sb2I9 NCs in a DAC with the corresponding pressure increases. 
The Cs3Sb2I9 NCs display red color under ambient conditions, followed by an obvious change to translucent dark red at 3.0 GPa. The Cs3Sb2I9 NCs within the DAC chamber gradually darken at higher pressures and eventually turn opaque black at above ∼6.0 GPa. The piezochromic behavior of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs is completely reversed to the original transparent bright red upon decompression, corresponding to changes of absorption spectra.
To investigate the structural relationship with the band gap evolution, angle dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction (ADXRD) experiments were performed to provide evolutional information on the structure of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs. As shown in Fig. 3a, in situ high-pressure ADXRD patterns indicate that the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs possess a hexagonal symmetry with the space group Pm1 (a = b = 8.2971(0) Å, c = 10.3145(0) Å) under ambient conditions, which agrees with previous reports.29 Refinements of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs at different pressures are shown in Fig. S5.† As the pressure increases, all Bragg diffraction peaks monotonically shift toward higher diffraction angles, originating from the pressure-induced lattice contraction. Moreover, no new peaks appear, and the profiles of all patterns always remain in the original state. Upon compression to about 2.0 GPa, the diffraction peaks of (201), (2−12), and (202) reflections at about 10.83°, 11.49° and 12.49° show a gradually weakened trend. However, the diffraction peaks of (003) and (103) gradually enhanced, which originates from the newly developed crystallographic orientation caused by a deviatoric stress.18 When the applied pressure exceeds 12.0 GPa, the Bragg diffraction peaks gradually weaken in intensity. The disappearance and broadening of some Bragg diffraction peaks accompanied by a broad diffuse background at about 11.0°–13.5° occur, indicating the onset of deteriorated crystallinity resulting from the disordered rearrangement [Sb2I9]3− cluster. Along with the applied pressure reaching 20.0 GPa, the intensity of some original Bragg diffraction peaks further decreased, only leaving a broad band, which corroborates the complete amorphization of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs. Upon decompression, the amorphous phase begins to recrystallize at 0.5 GPa (Fig. S6†). Furthermore, the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs reverted to their original state after the pressure was fully released (Fig. S7†). Meanwhile, the diffraction peaks of the recovered sample are obviously broadened and weakened, and partially disappeared, illustrating the incomplete recrystallization and the presence of the residual amorphous phase in the quenched sample.30 As the pressure increases, it is found that the lattice parameters of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs continuously decreased before the onset of the deteriorated crystallinity (Fig. 3b). As shown in Fig. 3c, the cell volume of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs continuously decreased, and the deviatoric stress on the surface of the sample is different, which decreased the crystallinity and increased the defects in the compression process. The experimental pressure–volume (P–V) data are fitted by utilizing the third-order Birch–Murnaghan equation of state:  where V0 is the zero-pressure volume, B0 is the bulk modulus at ambient pressure, and B′0 is a parameter for the pressure derivative. With B′0 fitted at 4, the bulk modulus (B0) of the Cs3Sb2I9 was estimated as 25.6(1) GPa. High-pressure compressibility as a parameter is always used to assess the sensitivity to pressure and ability of the structure to shrink along the particular direction.31 Therefore, we further studied the sensitivity to pressure along the particular direction with the help of the high-pressure compressibility. High pressure compressibilities of the a (b) and c axes in the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs are also shown in Fig. 3d; the compressibility decreases as the pressure increases, owing to the more compact structure at high pressure. The compressibility of the c axis is smaller than that of the b axis, and the exceptionally anisotropic phenomenon originates from the unique puckered layers of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs. Moreover, the rounded compressibility indicatrix in the ab plane shows that there is no obvious anisotropism within the intralayer structure (Fig. 3e).

The Raman spectra of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs with a frequency distribution from 50 cm−1 to 175 cm−1 upon compression are shown in Fig. S8a.† The main vibration modes are related to the [Sb2I9]3− cluster and identified based on previous reports.32 The curves from dark blue to green represent the variation trend of the pressure-dependent Raman shifts of 53.0 cm−1, 58.0 cm−1, 83.9 cm−1, 94.3 cm−1, 109.8 cm−1, 132.8 cm−1, 147.6 cm−1, and 165.7 cm−1 under ambient conditions (Fig. S8b†). Among them, Raman shifts at about 53.0 cm−1, 83.9 cm−1, 147.6 cm−1 and 165.7 cm−1 are assigned as bending modes and Sb–I–Sb interactions, Sb–I bending mode, antisymmetric Sb–I stretch and symmetric Sb–I stretch, respectively. As the pressure increases, all vibrational modes show a monotonic movement in the direction of a high Raman shift, which originates from the compression of the interatomic distance. With the increase of the pressure, the peaks of some initial vibration modes show a wide diffraction background and the peaks weakened. When the pressure exceeds 13.6 GPa, the peaks of all vibration modes disappear, indicating the structural amorphization. Furthermore, the Raman pattern recovers to its initial state upon the complete release of the pressure, indicating that the changes are reversible upon decompression, which is in good accordance with the experimental results of the ADXRD pattern under high pressure.
To gain insights into the electronic, optical, and defect properties of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs, we performed first-principles calculations with density functional theory (DFT) toward the band structures. The calculated band structures of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs are shown in Fig. 4a, which indicate a nearly direct band gap of 2.05 eV under ambient conditions. DFT analysis indicates that the difference between the direct and indirect band gaps of this material is small, which is consistent with the previous reports.12 The total and partial density of states (DOS) plots indicate that the valence band maximum (VBM) of the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs mainly originates from the interactions of I 5p and Sb 5s, whereas the conduction band minimum (CBM) is dominated by the I 5p and Sb 6p interactions. It also can be seen that the Cs+ cations do not contribute to the VBM and CBM directly. The calculated evolution trend of pressure-dependent band gaps is shown in Fig. 4b. The calculated electronic band structures of the Cs3Sb2I9 HPs at different pressures are shown in Fig. S9.† As the pressure increases, the calculated indirect band gap tends to decrease gradually. With the applied pressure reaching 2.0 GPa, the band gap continues to shorten at a relatively slow rate. It is clearly observed that the evolution of the calculated band gap agrees well with the experimental results.

The optical properties of perovskites are greatly influenced by the Sb–I skeleton, because it affects the overlap of wave functions.33 Accordingly, in order to elucidate the mechanism of band gap narrowing under pressure, the pressure-dependent Sb–I bond lengths and I–Sb–I bond angles within the Sb–I octahedron for the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs are depicted in Fig. 4c and d. In our study, the refinements of angle dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction (ADXRD) patterns were mainly adopted to determine the high-pressure crystal structure regarding the lattice parameters. Refinements of ADXRD patterns were accomplished using the Reflex module in the Materials Studio 8.0 program (Fig. S5†). Refined structural information of the Cs3Sb2I9 at 1 atm is shown in Table S1.† The corresponding refinement results unit-cell volume, lattice parameters, Rwp and Rp are shown in Tables S2 and S3,† respectively. The refined crystal structures under different pressures were obtained using the Materials Studio 8.0 program. The Sb–I bond lengths and I–Sb–I angles under different pressures were obtained using the VESTA program. The Sb–I bond lengths and I–Sb–I bond angles within the antimony-iodide octahedron for the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs are shown in Table S4.† There are two different chemical environments for iodide in this 2D perovskite crystal structure, I1 and I2, respectively. Therein, L1 and L2 are defined as the lengths of the long and short Sb–I1 bonds, respectively, in the Sb–I2 inorganic framework, the long Sb–I bonds involving I atoms located on the bridge connecting two Sb atoms, while θ1 and θ2 denote the I1–Sb–I1 bond angle and I2–Sb–I2 bond angle in the Sb–I inorganic framework (Fig. 4e). As observed, the Sb–I bond lengths decrease and the I–Sb–I bond angles only exhibit small changes with the applied pressure reaching 2.0 GPa, indicating that the Cs3Sb2I9 NCs are compressed under the action of pressure. Moreover, the adjacent [SbI6]3− octahedra get closer, resulting in the strengthening of the electrostatic interaction. The Cs3Sb2I9 NCs become more difficult to compress upon further compression. Therefore, the Sb–I bond lengths continue to shorten at a relatively slow rate, and the I–Sb–I bond angles θ1 and θ2 exhibit an almost uniform decreasing trend, while the bond angle Sb–I–Sb remained at 180°. These changes will enhance the electron cloud overlap between the Sb and I orbitals, which increases the electronic band dispersion. The contraction of both Sb–I bond length and I–Sb–I bond angle gives rise to the enhanced coupling of Sb 5s and I 5p orbitals at the VBM and increased electron cloud overlap of Sb 5p and I 5p orbitals at the CBM (Fig. 4f and g). The energy level will be significantly altered by pushing up the VBM and dropping the CBM, thus eventually leading to the narrowing of the band gap under high pressure. The pressure range of the bond length and bond angle is consistent with the band gap at about 2.0 GPa.
Conclusions
To sum up, with the help of high-pressure experiments, we successfully narrowed the band gap of lead-free 2D perovskite Cs3Sb2I9 NCs from 2.05 eV to 1.36 eV, with a measurable rate of 33.7%. The structural and optical changes of Cs3Sb2I9 NCs originate from the lattice compression and distortion. The Sb–I bond contraction promotes the orbital overlap accompanied by pushing up the valence band and dropping the conduction band, leading to a narrowed band gap. Synchrotron ADXRD and Raman experiments provide evolutional information on the structure, compression and amorphization of Cs3Sb2I9 NCs. The structural amorphization gradually begins at ca. 14.0 GPa, and the changes are reversible upon decompression. We also performed DFT band structure calculations, which are consistent with the experimental results. The research enhances the fundamental understanding of 2D Cs3Sb2I9 NCs and is expected to greatly advance the research progress of perovskites in band gap interception at high pressures. Our studies demonstrate that high pressure can be used as a robust tool to tailor the structure and properties of halide perovskites under extreme conditions.
