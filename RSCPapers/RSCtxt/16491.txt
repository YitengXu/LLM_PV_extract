    , Accepted 20th May 2020First published on 26th May 2020AbstractExposure to plasma can significantly increase the surface area of silver species and their resistance to oxidation. While some work investigating plasma-treated silver has been done, limited morphologies and applications have been explored. We hereby explore this effect on silver nanowires (AgNWs) through medium-vacuum air plasma exposure time ranging between 30 s to 60 min. These plasma-treated AgNW networks are directly applied as supercapacitor electrodes, without any carbon or polymer additives that are typically employed alongside silver in energy storage applications. The plasma treatment consequently affected the electrochemical performance of AgNWs, where longer treatment times resulted in higher energy storage capacity. An increase in resistance was observed for plasma treatment times greater than or equal to 5 min, due to the switch from the percolation threshold of the metallic Ag phase to the Ag2O phase. Despite an initial drop in stored energy, an overall improvement in energy storage capacity was observed throughout cycling, where the optimal plasma treatment time of 5 min resulted in an increase of 320% of its starting value with near 100% coulombic efficiency, through the development of stable redox-active surface nanostructures.
One-dimensional nanomaterials have gained significant interest from the scientific community in recent years due to their unique optical,1–3 thermal,4 mechanical,5–8 plasmonic,9,10 and electrical properties.11–14 Among which, silver nanowires (AgNWs) have attracted significant attention due to bulk silver's excellent electrical and thermal conductivities (up to 6.3 × 107 S m−1 and 429 W m−1 K−1, respectively).15 AgNW films exhibit high optical transparency and are a good candidate to replace the conventional indium tin oxide (ITO) films typically employed in transparent conducting electrodes (TCE) required for solar cells, photovoltaic cells, light-emitting diodes, touch screens, flat-panel displays, and flexible electronics.16–18
Research interests in AgNWs have gained significant attention, with over 1600 publications in the scientific literature throughout the past decade. However, the scientific and technological advances of plasma-treated AgNWs remain limited. The plasma treatment of AgNWs can be beneficial for their physical and electrical properties. For example, Yang et al. reported an increase in stability against oxidation under a harsh environment with high humidity up to 80%.19 This was achieved through a facile fluorocarbon plasma treatment process, without any significant trade-off towards the optical transparency or the sheet resistance.19 The synthesis of AgNWs typically involves the use of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the capping agent, which tends to remain on the surface of the AgNWs if not washed thoroughly, and hence would increase the overall sheet resistance.20–22 Li et al. was able to completely remove this coating by employing an argon plasma treatment method, which was able to enhance the contact area between each individual wire, lowering the sheet resistance.20 Apart from plasma treatment, the junction resistance of AgNW networks can be modified through thermal annealing, plasmonics welding, and mechanical pressing.23 Eom et al. observed negligible changes in the optical transmittance, and an optical shift towards the unsaturated colour region (true grey, white, or black) after argon plasma treatment, which is beneficial for TCE applications attributed to lower interference with the original intended colour.24 However, De Guzman et al. explored the introduction of oxygen during argon plasma treatment which led to damage of the AgNW network, increasing resistivity.25
Oxidation of silver in industrial applications is often undesirable and has been widely investigated and is typically realized in the presence of molecular oxygen at elevated temperatures.26 At lower temperatures or ambient conditions, exposure to atomic oxygen plasma is the primary method for the oxidation of silver.27–29 In addition to atomic oxygen, high levels of sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and mercaptans can be detrimental to the performance of silver due to silver sulfide corrosion.30 This corrosive effect on silver-based electronics is typically observed in areas with high levels of aerial pollutants and odours produced from industrial applications such as large-scale farming, landfills, wastewater treatment, automotive, and petroleum refineries.30,31
Throughout the oxidation process, swelling and cracking occurs at the surface of the oxide layer which subsequently allows diffusion of more oxygen into the bulk material through these cracks and defects.27 The oxidation of pure silver metals is not always detrimental if exploited accordingly. Oxide species derived from silver such as Ag2O and AgO have been implemented in a wide range of technologies, including but not limited to batteries, sensors, antibacterial applications, and oxidizing agents in chemicals processing.32,33 The oxidation of silver structures can therefore be selectively targeted to achieve morphologies and properties that could be beneficial towards the aforementioned applications.
For instance, El Mel et al. first reported the creation of highly porous silver-based nanocolumns via the oxidation of silver through direct exposure to plasma.29 This radio-frequency (RF) plasma source was generated with atmospheric air as the feeder gas. In contrast to the aforementioned plasma treatment studies on silver, El Mel et al. presented a unique outcome, where porosity was introduced into the silver nanostructure as a function of treatment time and plasma chamber pressure.26,29 Subsequent studies conducted by the same group explored this cracking-induced oxidation effect further with different structures and morphologies,26 as well as localized micro- and nano-patterning of silver thin films.34 However, this type of porous silver-based material has not been explored outside of simple electrical conduction applications.35
Untreated AgNWs have been used in supercapacitors as redox-active electrodes, where initial work includes 80 wt% AgNWs with nickel foam.36 Here the AgNWs are shown to contribute pseudocapacitance from the following redox reaction in an aqueous KOH electrolyte. 2Ag + 2OH− ⇔ Ag2O + H2O + 2e−(1)
This work, however, relied on the nickel foam and 15 wt% acetylene black to increase electrical conductivity and surface area as the (untreated) AgNWs used have relatively low surface areas compared to other materials such as activated carbons (>3000 m2 g−1)37 and metal organic frameworks (>6000 m2 g−1).38 To increase the surface area of these electrodes, AgNWs have been combined with carbon materials including carbon fiber,39,40 nanotubes,41 graphene,39,42,43 ordered mesoporous carbon,43 and in combination with conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PANI),39,41,44 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and polystyrene sulfonate mixture (PEDOT:PSS),45,46 polypyrrole,47,48 and poly(2,3-bis(3,4-bis(decyloxy)phenyl)-5,8-bis(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)quinoxaline) (PDOPEQ).49
We hereby describe the synthesis of high aspect ratio AgNWs, and the investigation into their physicochemical changes after direct line-of-sight air plasma treatment under ambient conditions. While the plasma treatment of silver have been explored previously,29,34 minimal focus was directed towards high aspect ratios AgNWs, with inadequate characterisation on the morphological changes. In this proof of concept study, the effect of fast and prolonged treatment times on the morphological changes of the AgNWs is extensively analysed. Additionally, the novelty of this work also resides in the direct application of these plasma-treated AgNWs as supercapacitor electrodes, to allow for the investigation into the direct relationship between plasma treatment time and changes in energy storage capability of the AgNW network. This is performed without the use of carbon or polymer additives that are typically employed alongside silver in similar energy storage applications, which would masks the contribution to energy storage of the AgNWs.
The AgNWs were synthesized via a conventional polyol process. Once purified, the morphology and aspect ratios of these AgNWs were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The wire diameter was determined to be approximately 200 nm, and the average length was evaluated to be approximately 60 μm. The synthetic and characterisation procedures for these AgNWs are described in the ESI.†
Six different plasma treatment times ranging from 10 s to 60 min were initially explored. The 10 seconds treatment time showed very little change to the morphology and thus these results were excluded. This wide range of treatment times was designed to allow for examination of any minute changes in the physicochemical properties of the AgNWs. SEM, in conjunction with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), was employed for this analysis, and the resultant SEM micrographs are shown in Fig. 1.

Plasma treatments were performed at various durations at a fixed pressure of 53 Pa and a power input of 20 W. This pressure was selected as it was previously reported to be optimal for a large oxide layer coverage at the surface, whilst producing high porosity simultaneously.29 The coating methodology and plasma treatment technique are detailed in the ESI.† Higher pressure would lead to a larger density in the oxide layer and a concurrent shrinkage of the pore size, which directly affects the resultant surface area. Conversely, lower pressure was determined to be inadequate as the low level of oxygen within the system was unable to generate high porosity, which is not ideal for the desired energy storage application.29Fig. 1a and b show the SEM micrographs of the original untreated AgNW samples, which were then subjected to different plasma treatment times of 30 s, 1 min, 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, and 60 min (Fig. 1c–h, respectively).
As observed in the SEM micrographs, the untreated AgNWs exhibited a smooth surface with very little defects. The overlaps between each AgNW were well-defined, with several touch-points along each of the wires, forming a well-connected silver network. These AgNWs displayed a pentagonal surface structure due to the nature of the solution-based polyol method. This is associated with the strong and selective adsorption of the capping agent PVP on the {100} facets of the initial multiple twinned particles.15,50 Consequently, the deposition of Ag atoms is then restricted to the longitudinal growth on the {111} facets rather than the {100} facets, therefore leading to the formation of long pentagonal surfaces and sharp-ended AgNWs.15,51
Exposure of the AgNWs to an oxygen-based plasma source for 30 s (Fig. 1c) was sufficient to initiate the oxidation process. At this point, the formation of silver oxide flakes was observed to initially develop at the edges between the pentagonal facets, which subsequently partially expanded over the flat surfaces of the wires. The presence of some flat surfaces was still visible in the SEM micrographs, where each individual wire was still distinguishable from one another. Additionally, it is important to notice the sintering effect of the plasma as overlapping AgNWs merge together as they reform, which is seen in the plasma treatment times greater than 1 min. It is expected that this sintering of the AgNW cores will increase the conductivity of the AgNW network, while the increasing proportion of silver oxide compared to silver in the AgNWs will decrease the overall conductivity.
An increase in the plasma treatment time to 1 min (Fig. 1d) resulted in complete coverage of the top layer of the AgNWs by oxide species. The presence of the pentagonal facets was no longer observed on any of the wires. The wires became rounder, with higher flexibility and curvatures, unlike their straight and rigid untreated precursor. However, each of these wires still remained independent from one another, similar to that of the 30 s treatment time. Growth was observed in the diameters of the wires once plasma-treated. This was expected, as the formation of oxide species was previously determined to occur in an expanding and cracking-induced manner.27,52 This mechanism started with the formation of a layer of silver oxide on the surface, followed by generation of cracks and pores that arose from the high stress environment within this oxide layer. These cracks and pores subsequently formed passageways for atomic oxygen in the plasma source to reach the underlying silver surface, and hence created another layer of oxide species. Consequently, this repetitive process led to the overall increased diameters and complex morphology seen in the plasma-treated AgNWs.
A longer plasma treatment time of 5 min (Fig. 1e) was able to convert the individual AgNWs into an interconnected network of highly porous silver oxide species. The overlaps between individual wires had irreversibly fused together during the cracking-induced oxidation process. The interconnected network remained wire-like with minimal scission along each wire. However, doubling the plasma treatment time to 10 min (Fig. 1f) increased the frequency of this scission. This was a direct result of excessive localized cracking at various points along the wires which led to this phenomenon, and hence discontinuity throughout the silver network. This effect was significantly amplified in the 30 min and 60 min plasma treatment times (Fig. 1g and h respectively). Severe breakages of the wires were observed at both of these treatment times, particularly in wires with smaller initial diameters. These breakages in the network are observable in a monolayer distribution of the wires, however it is expected this can be corrected/by using multiple or thicker layers of the AgNWs prior to plasma treatment and assembly of supercapacitors. Higher resistivities are expected in supercapacitors with longer plasma treatment time applied to the AgNWs, in comparison to a network with no scissions in the wires.
Based on the EDS data, increasing oxygen content is seen with increasing plasma treatment times. Table 1 shows the relative concentrations of silver compared to oxygen as calculated using AZtecEnergy (Oxford, UK) acquisition and analysis software; however, due to the collection geometry used, these values give only a treatment time. It is worth noting that a significant amount of oxygen was detected in the 5 min plasma treatment time and above, where the maximum concentration, achieved for 60 min plasma treatment, reached 31.7 at%, indicating an almost complete conversion to Ag2O species.28 The progressive increase in silver oxidation is also shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†

Although silver and silver oxide mixed-species remain electrically conductive, it is still inferior compared to its pure metal counterpart.53 Consequently, it was beneficial to investigate whether significant changes to the morphology would occur post-reduction to allow for potential investigation into networks of AgNWs with high surface area and porosity in future studies. A control test was performed on the 60 min plasma-treated AgNWs sample to reduce the silver oxide species back to silver at 200 °C in vacuo. As observed in Fig. S2a in the ESI,† a highly complex network of silver with large surface area was maintained after the reduction process. The presence of a wire-based network was in part observable, with the overall morphology being complex ‘web-like’ network.
Closer observation indicated that the precursor silver oxide flakes were converted into silver ball-like structures after reduction (Fig. S2b–d in the ESI†). While the degree of porosity may have decreased based on this change, the surface area would appear higher compared to that of the original untreated AgNWs. This is an important factor for energy storage applications. Consequently, the use of plasma treatment in combination with reduction back to silver could prove to be beneficial for applications where high conductivity of the AgNW network is paramount.
Sheet resistance of AgNW films deposited on quartz wafers with increasing plasma treatment time is seen in Fig. 2, where the resistance of the thin AgNW film increased steadily with longer treatment time, with a very sharp increase at 60 min. This is due to the loss in connectivity seen in the SEM images in Fig. 1 where AgNWs are seen breaking apart. The 200 °C annealing in vacuo done for 2 hours recovered much of this lost conductivity, however was unable to return to the low untreated AgNW resistances due to the damage caused, which is in good agreement with the images in Fig. 1.

This tuneable increase in the surface area of AgNWs has many potential applications, where we have only explored their use as a supercapacitor electrode. These plasma-treated AgNWs can be employed in more significant applications as photocatalysts54–56 or as an antibacterial agent used in medical wound pads. Wang et al. and Kim et al. conducted shape dependent antibacterial activity studies with Ag2O and determined that in increased surface area of the {100} crystal face provides the maximum Ag+ reactivity.57,58 Additionally, Ag2O can be used in conjunction with Ag, as these have different zeta potentials of −23 mV and +49 mV, respectively, which will interact with distinct surface charged microbes.59,60 One study looked at AgNWs and their antibacterial activity, which was less than nanoparticles and larger cubic particles.61 It is envisioned that when AgNWs are combined with an appropriate wound pad, as the AgNWs are plasma-treated, the fabric is being sterilized at the same time.
Supercapacitor coin cells are assembled with AgNWs with various plasma-treatment times to show the effect of the treatment on energy storage. The performance of these coin cells as supercapacitors was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The 100 mV s−1 voltammograms of the cycled coin cells showed distinct differences between the low and high plasma treatment times (Fig. 3a). The pseudocapacitance peaks centered around −0.075 V remained similar throughout all plasma treatment times; whereas the higher voltage peaks were significantly smaller in the lower treatment times. This contributed to a significant increase in energy storage from the plasma treatment which enabled stable cycling of these additional silver oxide species. This is shown in Fig. 3b, where specific energy of the half-cell is calculated at an initial point before long term cycling (initial), at the peak performance point during cycling (peak), and at cycle 5000 (final) to evaluate their electrochemical performance over their lifetime.

The discontinuity between 1 min and 5 min of plasma treatment times is significant and is attributed to the percolation threshold of the Ag2O phase over the metallic Ag phase causing a significant drop in electrical conductivity53 in higher plasma treatment times, which corresponds to approximately 10 at% oxygen compared to silver,62 resulting in a drop in stored energy. This is also seen in the EIS results shown in Fig. 3f, where the slope of the impedance for higher plasma treatment times indicates lower conductivities. The increase observed in the initial point of all samples, taking into account the discontinuity from the decrease in conductivity between 1 min and 5 min samples, shows the increase in double layered capacitance from the increased surface area generated from the plasma treatment. All of the AgNW half cells demonstrated an increase in specific energy with cycling as they were conditioned to a stable cycling mode, and thus were capable of retaining higher than the initial energies. The larger increase in energy storage for the longer plasma treatment times, even with lower bulk conductivities, was attributed to the additional stable redox processes enabled by the high surface area generated from the plasma treatments. Unfavourable redox processes that deteriorated in the short plasma treatment times were observed to be more stable in longer plasma treatment times. This cycling state does need to be developed throughout cycling as indicated in the voltammograms of the 5 min plasma-treated AgNWs before and after 5000 cycles at 1 A g−1 (Fig. 3c and d, respectively). Fig. 3e shows the cycling at 1 A g−1 of the 5 min plasma-treated AgNWs supercapacitor which increases to 0.86 Wh g−1, more than 320% of its starting value while retaining near 100% coulombic efficiency. The EIS in the inset of Fig. 3f, also shows a higher series resistance in the untreated AgNWs supercapacitor which may be attributed to the removal of non-conductive capping agent PVP used in the AgNW synthesis.
To understand how the morphology of plasma-treated AgNWs changes through cycling, further SEM imaging was performed after electrochemical testing within 2023 coin cells. Fig. 4a shows that the untreated AgNWs sample remained smooth with well-defined pentagonal facets even after cycling. In the 30 s and 1 min plasma-treated samples, the morphology of the high surface area oxides was observed to change from porous flakes into small spherical blemishes on the pentagonal AgNWs (Fig. 4b and c). With increasing plasma treatment times of 5 min and above, the high surface area oxides were retained, where the core of the wire collapsed back into a solid network, as seen in Fig. 4d and e. It is expected that the core of the 5 min plasma-treated AgNWs reduces back to metallic silver to form an electroactive Ag-Ag2O core shell structure, which is in agreement with Fig. 3b and may suggest restoration of the percolating network of metallic silver. In the higher plasma treatment times of 30 and 60 min, the AgNWs were able to retain even more of their high surface area after cycling, where the growths of different nanomaterial shapes including very thin nanosheets were observed. Fig. 4g and h show the retained higher surface area spherical features, with the growth of very thin silver nanosheets, respectively. These nanosheets appeared to be smaller in diameter and thicker in the 30 min plasma treatment time, and larger and thinner in the 60 min plasma treatment time.

Conclusions and implications
A short plasma treatment time of 30 s was enough to trigger an oxidative process on the AgNWs, where formation of porous flakes were observed, which allowed more atomic oxygen to penetrate the underlying silver core and hence further enabled oxidation when longer plasma treatment times were applied. This was evidenced by the growth in relative concentration of atomic oxygen, ranging from 1.4 at% up to 31.7 at% for plasma treatment times of 30 s and 60 min, respectively. These plasma treated AgNW networks are shown to maintain low sheet resistance up to 30 min plasma treatment times. In contrast to the work conducted by El Mel and coworkers,29,34 these changes on the morphology were extensively analysed, with a pronounced focus on the structure of AgNWs and the degree of oxidation as a function of plasma treatment time.
Additionally, these plasma-treated AgNWs were directly incorporated into coin cells without any carbon or polymer additives, and their sole performance as supercapacitor electrodes were determined. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first reported studies where plasma-treated silver is explored in a more complex area outside of simple electrical conduction applications.35 Higher energy storage capability was obtained for AgNWs subjected to longer plasma treatment time. However, an initial drop in energy stored was observed for 5 min treatment time and above, which is primarily attributed to the shift from the percolation threshold of highly conductive Ag phase to relatively inferior Ag2O phase. Despite this, an overall increase in energy storage capability was observed. After 5 min of plasma treatment, the specific energy of the AgNWs network increased to 0.86 W h g−1, corresponding to more than 320% of the starting value, with near 100% coulombic efficiency.
This is the first use of AgNWs as a supercapacitor electrode where no other additives are used. The present proof of concept demonstrates the viability and enhancement of AgNWs as electrodes in energy storage applications, which is achievable via a simple and time-effective plasma treatment technique, which can be combined with other materials which enhance energy storage. Additionally, the tuneable surface area observed would be favourable towards a wide range of other applications aside from energy storage,29 including but not limited to optical sensors,63 biomedical,57,58,61 water desalination,64 and catalysis.65–67
With an increasing amount of studies targeting the direct-write of electronic devices,68–72 the use of plasma treatment could prove to be beneficial. AgNW inks have been demonstrated to exhibit higher conductivity and thermal stability compared to inks based on carbon nanotubes or other metals.70 Applications such as electronic circuitry, antenna, sensor, energy storage, and tissues engineering require complex and precise deposition of multicomponent and multiphase materials.73 Optimized plasma treatment of silver-based materials prior to direct-write deposition has the potential to introduce multifunctional properties and porosity into the silver, without compromising on desirable properties such as conductivity, flexibility, and biological activity.
