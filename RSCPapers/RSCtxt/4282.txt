Ethanol vapor treatment of 6 µm long vertically aligned titania nanotube array films initially annealed at 580 °C for 6 h in an oxygen environment, under autogeneous pressure at 140 °C (≈50 psi), resulted in an increase of up to ∼30% in the photoconversion efficiency. A significant improvement in the crystallinity as revealed by glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) and Raman spectroscopy studies as well as incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) is observed in the vapor treated samples.
Introduction
Our interest is in the solar generation of hydrogen by water photoelectrolysis. In 1972 Fujishima and Honda1 first reported light-driven water splitting using titanium dioxide under ultraviolet radiation. While the bandgap of titania is too large to capture but a small portion, ≈5%, of the incident solar spectrum energy it is largely immune to photocorrosion with excellent charge transfer properties.2–4 In recent years there has been considerable interest in the use of vertically oriented n-type TiO2nanotube arrays, synthesized by electrochemical anodization of titanium.5–9 The thin-wall nanotube array architecture offers high effective surface area, facile diffusion of the photogenerated holes to the electrolyte, and directed charge transfer of the photogenerated electrons to the back contact for hydrogen evolution.10
A high degree of crystallization appears to be a pre-requisite for useful photocatalytic materials, with crystallinity playing a key role in charge separation and transport.11,12 In general, higher crystallinity implies fewer amorphous regions and grain boundaries, and hence a lower density of trap states. The anodically grown titania nanotube arrays are amorphous and hence exhibit negligible photocatalytic activity. These nanotubes begin to crystallize in anatase phase at approximately 280 °C, with the crystallite size and crystallized volume increasing with annealing temperature.13 For 6 µm long TiO2nanotube arrays on Ti substrates, increased photoconversion efficiencies are observed with increasing annealing temperatures; maximum photoconversion efficiencies are reached with annealing temperatures of 580–620 °C.8,14 However high annealing temperatures in an oxygen ambient, which is required to maintain titania stoichiometry, result in the growth of a dense rutile layer from the metal film underlying the nanotube arrays introducing a significant series resistance that hinders transport of the photogenerated electrons to the back contact.9 We note that the nanotube walls consist of anatase crystallites; an anatase to rutile phase transformation does not take place due to the constraints imposed by the nanotube walls unless the walls are coarsened or destroyed by annealing at temperatures above this temperature range.13 Therefore to further enhance the photoconversion efficiency of samples thermally annealed under optimal conditions it is necessary to: (a) lower the thickness of the underlying rutile layer; (b) further increase the crystallite size; (c) reduce/eliminate any remaining amorphous regions.

        Solvothermal methods are well known routes for crystal size enhancement.15,16 Reactions take place in a closed system under autogeneous pressure, which can be varied by choice of solvent, reaction temperature and volume filling of the reaction vessel.17,18 However, when solvothermal treatments were performed on water immersed nanotube array samples we observed disorientation of the vertically aligned nanotubes and detachment of the tubes from the underlying substrate. These problems were eliminated when ethanol19,20 was used instead of water, with the samples exposed to the resulting ethanol vapor rather than keeping them in physical contact with the liquid medium. We find and report herein that high-pressure ethanol vapor treatment of otherwise optimally thermally annealed samples results in a significant photoconversion efficiency enhancement.
Experimental

Nanotube array films were grown by anodization of titanium foil (from Sigma–Aldrich, 99.8%, 0.25 mm thick) in an electrolyte containing potassium fluoride (KF, 0.1 M), tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH, 0.05 M), trisodium citrate (0.2 M) and sodium hydrogen sulfate (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI).8Anodization was conducted in a two-electrode electrochemical cell with a platinum cathode. All samples were prepared at an anodization voltage of 25 V over a 17 h duration. The electrolyte pH was kept at 5 for the duration of the anodization, adjusted as necessary by addition of sodium hydrogen sulfate. The as-anodized samples were ultrasonically cleaned in de-ionized water to remove any debris from the film surface, i.e. solution precipitate.
The ethanol vapor treatment was carried out in a 23 ml Teflon lined stainless steel chamber. Optimal sample crystallization conditions were found with a reaction temperature of 140 °C and 25% filling volume. Hence for sample treatment 6 ml of ethanol was placed within the reaction chamber, with the nanotube array sample mounted on the top of a grooved Teflon stub to avoid direct contact with the liquid medium. The sealed chamber was kept at 140 °C, corresponding to a reaction chamber pressure of approximately 50 psi, for 18 h.
Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the samples were studied using a three-electrode photoelectrolysis cell configuration with a 1 M KOH electrolyte, titania nanotube array photoanode, platinum foil counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. A scanning potentiostat (CH Instruments, model CHI 600B) was used to measure dark and illuminated current at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The nanotube array anodes were irradiated either by near-ultraviolet light (320–400 nm) from a 50 W high-pressure mercury short arc lamp (Exfolite) or light from a 150 W ozone free xenon arc lamp fitted with a global AM 1.5 filter. The incident power density of the radiation from the UV source was set to 100 mW cm−2 using a thermopile detector (Newport corporation), and that of AM 1.5 light was set to 100 mW cm−2 with the help of an NREL calibrated silicon solar cell. A two-electrode cell configuration was used for determining the photoconversion efficiency.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD, Scintag X-ray diffractometer) pattern of an as-anodized titania nanotube array sample and a similar sample after being subjected to the ethanol vapor treatment that provides a minimal degree of crystallization. Measured photocurrents of vapor treated samples, under UV illumination, were minimal and showed no improvement with subsequent thermal annealing of the sample.

Fig. 2 shows GAXRD patterns of a thermally annealed sample and a vapor treated thermally annealed sample (samples of the same dimensions and identical instrument conditions were used for recording the spectra). The patterns from both samples show identical peak positions and the presence of both anatase and rutile phases. It is known from previous studies that the anatase reflections are primarily from the nanotube walls and rutile reflections from the thermally oxidized metal layer underneath the nanotubes.13 All major reflections from the vapor treated thermally annealed sample are stronger than those of the untreated sample, indicating a significant increase in the degree of crystallization with the ethanol vapor treatment.

To further confirm the improvement in the crystallinity, Raman spectra were recorded for both the thermally annealed and the vapor treated thermally annealed samples prepared under identical conditions. We used a WITec (CRM200) confocal Raman spectrometer at room temperature, excitation wavelength of 514.5 nm, with a 1800 grooves per mm grating used for spatially dispersing the Raman scattered light. Fig. 3 shows the normalized Raman spectra of the low frequency Eg mode in anatase for the thermally annealed (dotted line) and ethanol vapor treated (solid line) samples. The peak corresponding to the thermally annealed sample is blue shifted and broadened; since oxygen stoichiometry and stress levels are not significantly affected by the vapor treatment,21 this indicates a higher crystallinity in the ethanol vapor treated sample.

Fig. 4 shows the photoresponse of a thermally annealed sample (580 °C for 6 h in oxygen) and the thermally annealed sample after ethanol vapor treatment. The photocurrent of the vapor treated thermally annealed sample shows a sharp increase to saturation. The effective series resistance of a photoelectrochemical cell arises mainly from the semiconductor, semiconductor/metal interfaces and electrolyte. The sharp increase in current seen in Fig. 4 indicates a reduction in the series resistance of the cell, which in turn is related to the reduction in barrier layer thickness and/or improvement in the sample crystallinity. Since both samples were subjected to the same thermal treatment they possess the same underlying oxide layer thickness, hence the photoresponse improvement appears due to enhanced crystallinity of the treated samples. For all samples the dark current was negligible, several orders of magnitude less than the photocurrent values.

For calculating the photoconversion efficiency a two-electrode cell configuration with the electrical bias applied between the anode and the working electrode was employed. The efficiency η was calculated using the following relation:14,22,23  where jp is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), I0 is the intensity of incident light (mW cm−2), and V is the potential applied between the titania anode and platinum cathode. Under UV irradiation we achieved a photoconversion efficiency of 13% for the thermally annealed ethanol vapor treated samples, an efficiency approximately 30% greater than the thermally annealed samples. Fig. 5 shows the response of the vapor treated and untreated thermally annealed nanotube array samples when exposed to AM 1.5 illumination. As in the case of UV irradiation, the vapor treated samples show significantly improved photocurrents. The vapor treatment of the thermally annealed sample increases the photoconversion efficiency from 0.40% to 0.56%, a 40% increase.

The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the vapor treated and untreated thermally annealed samples was measured over the wavelength range 350–500 nm in KOH electrolyte while applying a constant bias of 0.5 V between the photoanode and cathode. An IPCE close to 80%, see Fig. 6, is indicative of very efficient light to chemical energy conversion by the nanotube array architecture. The higher IPCE of the vapor treated samples indicates that the number of carrier recombination centers was reduced, which can be attributed to an increase in crystallization as a result of the ethanol vapor treatment.

Conclusions
We demonstrate a novel process using a combination of high temperature thermal annealing followed by a 140 °C (≈50 psi) ethanol vapor treatment to successfully enhance the crystallinity of titania nanotube array films. Used as photoanodes, the photoconversion efficiencies of the vapor treated thermally annealed samples are significantly increased. Although an increase of up to ≈30% in photoconversion efficiency and up to ≈10% in IPCE was observed, and not uncommon, the magnitude of the increase in efficiency values of course varied with respect to the specific sample. While the dominant process affecting crystallinity is not evident, the post-thermal annealing vapor treatment appears to increase the crystalline grain size, thereby reducing the number of grain boundaries and/or amorphous regions helping to reduce the number of carrier recombination sites that, in turn, promotes charge carrier transport during photoelectrochemical processes.
