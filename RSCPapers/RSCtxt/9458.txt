    , Accepted 14th February 2022First published on 14th February 2022AbstractA novel nanocomposite of Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets supporting Pt nanoparticles (Pt/Co–Al2O3) was prepared. By merely utilizing focused UV-Vis-IR illumination from a 500 W Xe lamp, highly efficient photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4 (CRM) on Pt/Co–Al2O3 is achieved. This demonstrates very high production rates of CO (rCO, 89.41 mmol min−1 g−1) and H2 (rH2, 75.60 mmol min−1 g−1), and high light-to-fuel efficiency (η, 27.2%), enhanced by 5.4, 6.0, and 6.2 times as compared to those of Al2O3 nanosheets supporting Pt nanoparticles (Pt/Al2O3). Pt/Co–Al2O3 also demonstrates good catalytic durability as the side-reactions of coke deposition are significantly blocked. In striking contrast, Pt/Al2O3 quickly deactivates due to its high coke deposition rate (rC), 15.3 times higher than that of Pt/Co–Al2O3. The significantly promoted photothermocatalytic performance arises from a synergetic effect between Pt and Co–Al2O3. The formation of a Pt/Co–Al2O3 interface significantly promotes CH4 dissociation to carbon species as compared to Pt/Al2O3, thus increasing the catalytic activity. The active oxygen of Co–Al2O3 participates in the oxidation of carbon species as the rate-determining step of CRM, thus not only increasing the catalytic activity, but also blocking carbon species being polymerized to coke. The photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 follows a mechanism of light-driven thermocatalysis. The intense absorption across the whole sunlight spectrum of Co–Al2O3 induced by Co doping substantially intensifies the photothermal conversion of Pt/Co–Al2O3, thus improving the catalytic activity. A novel photoactivation is discovered to considerably increase the catalytic activity due to the oxidation of carbon species being promoted upon illumination.
1. Introduction
Due to fossil fuels being burned in diverse industrial processes, extremely large quantities of CO2 as a greenhouse gas are emitted. This induces serious environmental problems (e.g. global warming and extreme weather) as well as energy shortage. Many countries formulate action plans for peak CO2 emissions and carbon neutrality. To actualize the targets of the action plans, it is urgently needed to develop effective technologies of CO2 emission reduction. In the past few decades, a strategy of photocatalytic CO2 reduction with or without organic compounds as electron donors has attracted extensive interest because CO2 is converted to solar fuels and solar energy is stored.1–22 For the strategy of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, two major challenges of small fuel formation rate (rfuel) and light-to-fuel efficiency (η) are to be addressed. To address the challenges, persistent efforts have been made by preparing a lot of efficient photocatalysts that could be excited by UV, visible, and even infrared light.1–27
In recent years, the strategies of photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction by H2O,28–32 H2,33–36 and CH4 (ref. 37–47) have attracted interests because they perfectly combine the high catalytic efficiency of thermocatalytic CO2 reduction and the light-to-fuel conversion of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, and could efficiently use solar energy including UV, visible, and infrared light. Thus, in comparison with the strategy of photocatalytic CO2 reduction,28–36rfuel is substantially elevated. Among the strategies, photothermocatalytic CO2 reduction by CH4 to synthesize syngas (CRM, CO2 + CH4 = 2H2 + 2CO, ΔH298 = 247 kJ mol−1) is extraordinarily promising because the two greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) are converted to solar fuels, and high rfuel and η could be simultaneously achieved by using several nanostructured catalysts of group VIII metals.37–39,45–47 For the photothermocatalytic CRM strategy, it is a grand challenge to address the two key issues of further substantially increasing rfuel and η, and improving catalytic durability and coking resistance. In principle, the first key issue could be addressed by increasing the thermocatalytic activity and optical absorption of catalysts. For example, Zhou et al.39 prepared Cu–Ru single-atom alloy catalysts by using metallic Cu with strong plasmonic absorption to increase optical absorption, and obtained high rCH4 (16.5 mmol min−1 g−1) and η (∼15%) by photothermocatalytic CRM. Addressing the second key issue is particularly difficult because the coke deposition side-reactions of CH4 complete dissociation (CH4 = 2H2 + C, ΔH298 = 75 kJ mol−1) and CO disproportionation (2CO = CO2 + C, ΔH298 = −171 kJ mol−1), resulting in catalyst deactivation and dangerous reactor plug formation, are thermodynamically unavoidable during CRM.45–48 In principle, the key issue is merely tackled through kinetically blocking coke deposition by rationally designing catalysts.
Herein, we used Co doped Al2O3 (Co–Al2O3) with intense absorption across the whole solar spectrum and active oxygen as the support to prepare a novel nanocomposite of Co–Al2O3 supporting Pt nanoparticles (Pt/Co–Al2O3). By merely using focused UV-Vis-IR illumination, highly efficient photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 is achieved. This demonstrates high rCO, rH2, and η, enhanced by 5.4, 6.0, and 6.2 times in comparison with those of Pt/Al2O3. Pt/Co–Al2O3 also demonstrates good catalytic durability as the coke deposition side-reactions are significantly blocked. In striking contrast, Pt/Al2O3 rapidly deactivates due to its high coke deposition rate, 15.3 times higher than that of Pt/Co–Al2O3. The significantly promoted photothermocatalytic performance arises from a synergetic effect between Pt and Co–Al2O3. Photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 abides by a mechanism of light-driven thermocatalysis, which is substantially promoted by a novel photoactivation, quite unlike conventional semiconductor photocatalysis. In accordance with various pieces of evidence, the origin of the synergetic effect and the photoactivation are unveiled.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation
Co doped Al2O3: 0.3055 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 7.5003 g Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and 2.1100 g urea were added to 50 mL deionized water in a beaker, and dissolved with magnetic stirring. The resultant solution was added to a 70 mL Teflon bottle, which was placed in a stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave, placed in an electric oven, was heated to 150 °C and maintained at that temperature for 24 h. The obtained precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water, dried at 120 °C for 12 h in an electric oven, and finally calcined at 500 °C for 8 h in a muffle furnace. The obtained powder was denoted as Co–Al2O3.
Al2O3: Al2O3 was prepared in accordance with the same procedure as Co–Al2O3 except for no Co(NO3)2·6H2O being used.
Pt/Co doped Al2O3: 0.0055 g of Pt(NO3)2 solution with a Pt amount of 18.02 wt% and 0.2000 g Co–Al2O3 were added to 5 mL deionized water in an evaporating dish. The mixture was ground on a 180 °C heating plate until it was dried. The resultant powder was denoted as PtO/Co–Al2O3. 0.050 g of PtO/Co–Al2O3, put in a quartz tubular reactor, was heated at 10 °C min−1 to 800 °C and maintained at 800 °C for 1 h in a flow of 5 vol% H2/Ar.
Pt/Al2O3: Pt/Al2O3 was prepared in accordance with the same procedure as Pt/Co–Al2O3 except for using Al2O3 instead of Co–Al2O3.
2.2 Characterization
XRD patterns of the samples of Pt/Co–Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, Co–Al2O3, and Al2O3 were acquired on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Dmax). TEM images were obtained on an electron microscope (JEM-ARM200F). The elemental compositions were determined on an inductively coupled plasma/optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Optima 4300DV). For the ICP-OES analysis of Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3, the samples of PtO/Co–Al2O3 and PtO/Al2O3 were used as metallic Pt is chemically inert. The samples of PtO/Co–Al2O3 and PtO/Al2O3 were dissolved in aqua regia (concentrated HCl/HNO3 with a volume ratio of 3/1) and diluted using de-ionized water. XPS spectra were recorded on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi) by utilizing Mg Kα radiation. The charge was referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV of adventitious carbon. BET surface areas were measured on a physisorption instrument (ASAP 2020) by N2 adsorption. CO2 adsorption isotherms and CO2 adsorption capacities of the samples were measured at 0 °C (ice water) on an ASAP 2020 physisorption instrument. The thermogravimetric/mass spectrometry (TG-MS) profiles for the used samples of Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 after catalytic durability photothermocatalytic tests were obtained on a thermal analyzer (STA449F3) linked with a mass spectrometer (QMS403). Diffuse reflectance absorption spectra were obtained on a spectrophotometer (UV-3600). Raman spectra were obtained on a Raman microscope (Renishaw inVia) with 514.5 nm excitation.
2.3 Photothermocatalytic or photocatalytic tests
Photothermocatalytic or photocatalytic CRM on the samples of Pt/Co–Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, Co–Al2O3, and Al2O3 was conducted using a home-made stainless steel reactor with a quartz window.44–46 Focused irradiation from a 500 W Xe lamp was used as the light source without using any additional heater. A stream of 28.60/28.70/42.70 vol% CH4/CO2/Ar, controlled by a mass flow meter (S49-31/MT), continuously flowed at 89.8 mL min−1 into the reactor with 0.010 g of the samples. To conduct photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 with focused visible-IR irradiation, a λ > 420 or 560 nm long-wave pass filter was put in the front of the reactor quartz window. The power of the focused UV-Vis-IR irradiation is 6734.2 mW. The irradiation spot size is about 5 mm. Thus, the intensity of the focused UV-Vis-IR irradiation was 343.0 kW m−2, corresponding to a solar flux concentration ratio of 343.0. The power values of the focused vis-IR irradiation of λ > 420 and 560 nm are 5650.9 and 4898.1 mW, respectively. Their corresponding light intensities are 287.8 and 249.5 kW m−2, respectively. A GC-9560 gas chromatograph (GC) was used to analyze the reactants and products. The procedures of photothermocatalytic tests, the focused irradiation power measurement, light-to-fuel efficiency calculation, and GC analysis are reported in detail in previous work.44
For conducting photocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 under focused UV-Vis-IR irradiation, 0.010 g Pt/Co–Al2O3 was put on the steel bottom of the reactor. The reactor was put in an ice-water bath to maintain the photocatalytic reaction at near room temperature.
2.4 Controlled catalytic tests
Catalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 at different temperatures in the dark or under focused irradiation was conducted on a quartz tubular reactor that was linked with a quartz window.45,46 The reactor was placed in a tubular electric furnace to control the reaction temperature for catalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3. 0.0030 g Pt/Co–Al2O3 was pre-reduced by 5 vol% H2/Ar (50.0 mL min−1) at 800 °C for 1 h. After the reactor was cooled to 700 °C, the 5 vol% H2/Ar stream was switched to a stream of 9.76/9.76/80.48 vol% CH4/CO2/Ar (48.5 mL min−1). Temperature programmed catalytic CRM at different temperatures in the dark or under focused irradiation was conducted by decreasing the reaction temperature at 2 °C min−1 from 700 °C. The power values for the focused irradiation of UV-Vis-IR, λ > 420 and 560 nm vis-IR, are 6734.2, 5650.9, and 4898.1 mW, respectively.
2.5 CH4 temperature programmed dissociation (CH4-TPD) and CH4 temperature programmed oxidation by pre-adsorbed CO2 (CH4-TPO-CO2)
CH4-TPD and CH4-TPO-CO2 on the samples of Pt/Co–Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, Co–Al2O3, and Al2O3 in the dark or under irradiation were conducted on a multifunctional adsorption apparatus (TP-5080) by using a quartz tubular reactor linked to a quartz window. The effluent gas from the reactor was monitored by using an online mass spectrometer (HPR-20 R&D). For CH4-TPD, 0.0025 g of the sample was pre-reduced at 800 °C for 30 min in a flow of 5 vol% H2/Ar (24.0 mL min−1, purified by a tube of deoxidant). After being cooled to room temperature, the pre-reduced sample was heated to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1 in a flow of high purity CH4 (24.0 mL min−1, purified by a tube of deoxidant) in the dark or under UV-Vis-IR irradiation (589.0 mW cm−2).
For CH4-TPO-CO2, 0.0025 g of the sample was pre-reduced at 800 °C for 30 min in a stream of 5 vol% H2/Ar (24.0 mL min−1, purified by a tube of deoxidant). After being cooled to room temperature, the 5 vol% H2/Ar stream was switched to a stream of high purity He (24.0 mL min−1, purified by a tube of deoxidant) to 400 °C at 10 °C min−1, and maintained at 400 °C for 1 h to remove the desorbed H2. After being cooled to room temperature, the He stream was switched to a stream of high purity CO2 (24.0 mL min−1) and kept at room temperature for 30 min for CO2 adsorption. Then, the CO2 stream was switched to a stream of high purity He (24 mL min−1, purified by a tube of deoxidant) to remove free and physically adsorbed CO2 for 15 min. Finally, the resultant sample with the pre-adsorbed CO2 was heated in a flow of high purity CH4 (24.0 mL min−1, purified by a tube of deoxidant) to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1 in the dark or under UV-Vis-IR irradiation (565.7 mW cm−2).
2.6 Isotope labeling
The isotope labeling test for 12C18O2 (Aldrich) being reduced by 12CH4 on Pt/Co–Al2O3 was conducted on a home-made setup using a photothermocatalytic reactor. This reactor was connected via a micropump to a FTIR cell which was put in the chamber of an infrared spectrometer (Nicolet-6700). 0.010 g Pt/Co–Al2O3 was pre-treated by a stream of 5 vol% H2/Ar (25.0 mL min−1) for 1 h under focused UV-Vis-IR irradiation (6734.2 mW). After cooling to ambient temperature, the 5 vol% H2/Ar stream was switched to a stream of high purity N2 to remove the unreacted and adsorbed H2 in the reactor. Then, 10 mL 12C18O2 and 20 mL 12CH4 were fed into the reactor. Upon UV-Vis-IR irradiation, FTIR spectra were recorded at a known time.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Catalyst characterization
The nanocomposite of Co doped Al2O3 nanosheets supporting Pt nanoparticles (denoted as Pt/Co–Al2O3) was prepared (see the Experimental). For comparison, a reference nanocomposite of Al2O3 nanosheets supporting Pt nanoparticles (denoted as Pt/Al2O3) was prepared by the same procedure as Pt/Co–Al2O3 except for Al2O3 being used as the support instead of Co–Al2O3. ICP analysis demonstrates that the amounts of Pt in Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 are 0.297 wt% and 0.355 wt%, respectively. The amount of Co in Pt/Co–Al2O3 is 3.860 wt%. XRD analysis demonstrates that Al2O3 in Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 is cubic crystalline alumina (PDF 50-0741) (Fig. 1). The average crystal sizes of Al2O3 in Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3, determined using the Scherrer formula (L = 0.89λ/βcosθ) at 2θ belonging to the {400} facets, are 6.0 and 6.4 nm, respectively. No peaks of metallic Pt are observed by XRD for both Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 due to the amount of Pt being less than the detection limit by XRD. No peaks of metallic Co and cobalt oxides are observed by XRD for Pt/Co–Al2O3. Pt/Co–Al2O3 was characterized by TEM. TEM image demonstrates that Al2O3 in Pt/Co–Al2O3 has morphologies of nanosheets. The HAADF image (Fig. 2B) shows that Pt nanoparticles (white dots) are distributed on Al2O3 nanosheets. The corresponding size distribution shows that the average size of Pt nanoparticles in Pt/Co–Al2O3 is 1.7 nm (Fig. 2C). As demonstrated by the HRTEM image (Fig. 2D), Al2O3 has a lattice spacing of {400} facets (0.197 nm), and Pt nanoparticles have a lattice spacing of {111} facets (0.227 nm) (PDF 04-0802) for Pt/Co–Al2O3. EDS mapping shows that Co is uniformly distributed in Al2O3 for Pt/Co–Al2O3 (ESI, Fig. S1†). Pt/Al2O3 was also characterized by TEM. Similarly, Al2O3 in Pt/Al2O3 has morphologies of nanosheets (Fig. S2A†). As demonstrated by the enlarged TEM image, Pt nanoparticles (black dots) are dispersed on Al2O3 nanosheets (Fig. S2B†). The average size of Pt nanoparticles in Pt/Al2O3, shown by their size distribution, is 2.0 nm (Fig. S2C†). As demonstrated by the HRTEM image (Fig. S2D†), Al2O3 has a lattice spacing of {400} facets (0.197 nm), and Pt nanoparticles have a lattice spacing of {111} facets (0.227 nm).

The element valence states of Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 were analyzed by XPS. Co 2p of Pt/Co–Al2O3 shows two strong XPS peaks around 781.2 and 797.0 eV as well as their corresponding satellite peaks around 786.3 and 802.2 eV. They are typically those of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 for Co2+.49 The O 1s XPS peak of both Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 is located around 530.6 eV, which is assigned to O2− 1s (Fig. 3B).49 The Al 2p peak of Pt/Al2O3 is located around 74.1 eV, which is assigned to Al3+ 2p. Compared to Pt/Al2O3, the Al 2p XPS peak of Pt/Co–Al2O3 shifts to a lower binding energy (73.6 eV) (Fig. 3C).49 This is ascribed to Al2O3 being doped with Co2+ ions, which causes the transfer of electrons from Co2+ to Al3+ through the Co–O–Al bonds. Pt 4d XPS peaks of both Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 are located around 330.7 eV and 314.2 eV. They are attributed to 4d3/2 and Pt 4d5/2 for metallic Pt, respectively.49

N2 adsorption was used to characterize Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 (Fig. S3 and S4†). The BET surface areas of Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 are 150.4 and 151.2 m2 g−1, respectively. Their pore volumes by BJH adsorption are 0.73 and 0.49 cm3 g−1, respectively.
3.2 Photothermocatalytic activity and light-to-fuel conversion
A home-made reactor merely with focused illumination from a 500 W Xe lamp was used to test photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Co–Al2O3. Pt/Al2O3 demonstrates photothermocatalytic activity for CRM with focused UV-Vis-IR illumination. Its reaction rates of CO2 (rCO2) and CH4 (rCH4) are 9.02 and 7.30 mmol min−1 g−1 (Fig. 4A), and its production rates of CO (rCO) and H2 (rH2) are 16.69 and 12.60 mmol min−1 g−1, respectively (Fig. 4B). Its rH2/rCO ratio (0.75) being smaller than the CRM stoichiometric ratio (1.0) primarily arises from the reverse water–gas shift (CO2 + H2 = H2O + CO) as a side reaction of CRM. Surprisingly, Pt/Co–Al2O3 demonstrates much higher photothermocatalytic activity than Pt/Al2O3. Compared to those of Pt/Al2O3, its rCO2 and rCH4 are 49.18 and 40.31 mmol min−1 g−1) (Fig. 4A), enhanced by 5.5 and 5.5 times. Its rCO and rH2 are 89.41 and 75.60 mmol min−1 g−1, enhanced by 5.4 and 6.0 times (Fig. 4B). This demonstrates that loading Pt nanoparticles on Co doped Al2O3 instead of Al2O3 tremendously enhances catalytic activity. Photothermocatalytic activity of Al2O3 and Co–Al2O3 was also tested under the same reaction conditions. Al2O3 has rCO and rH2 of 0.66 and 2.16 mmol min−1 g−1, far less than those of Pt/Al2O3 (Fig. 4B). Co–Al2O3 demonstrates higher photothermocatalytic activity than Al2O3. Its rCO and rH2 are 6.08 and 2.40 mmol min−1 g−1, far less than those of Pt/Co–Al2O3 (Fig. 4B). This result demonstrates that the main catalytically active sites of both Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 are Pt nanoparticles.
 Fig. 4  The values of rCO2 and rCH4 (A), rCO and rH2 (B), and η (C) for photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, Co–Al2O3, and Al2O3 with focused UV-Vis-IR illumination. As Pt/Al2O3 quickly loses catalytic activity (Fig. S5A†), the data for Pt/Al2O3 in Fig. 4 are those after the initial 10 min. 
CRM is strongly endothermic. Its large ΔH298 (247 kJ mol−1) is close to that of photocatalytic H2O splitting (ΔH298 = 286 kJ mol−1), widely studied for solar fuel production.50 As the photothermocatalytic CRM is merely driven by focused illumination, the very high photothermocatalytic activity of Pt/Co–Al2O3 (Fig. 4A and B) suggests the realization of highly efficient light-to-fuel conversion. Therefore, η is calculated by using the equation.45–47  , ΔcH0CO, and  are the standard combustion heats (298.15 K) of H2, CO, and CH4 as fuels, respectively (note:  is 0). Pillumination is the illumination power.
Pt/Co–Al2O3 demonstrates a very high η of 27.2%, 6.2 times larger than that of Pt/Al2O3 (4.4%, Fig. 4C). This demonstrates that loading Pt nanoparticles on Co doped Al2O3 instead of Al2O3 significantly enhances light-to-fuel efficiency. However, the very high η for photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 is far below its thermodynamic maximum value (ηmax) (59.5%, ESI†), determined by Carnot efficiency as well as solar absorption efficiency.46,47,51 This suggests that η could be further significantly increased by photothermocatalytic CRM.
Merely with focused vis-IR illumination, Pt/Co–Al2O3 also demonstrates efficient photothermocatalytic CRM (Fig. 5). With λ > 420 nm focused vis-IR illumination, its rCO2 and rCH4 are 30.69 and 39.48 mmol min−1 g−1 (Fig. 5A). Its rCO and rH2 are 69.98 and 54.90 mmol min−1 g−1 (Fig. 5B). Its η is 24.1% (Fig. 4C). High rCO and rH2 (53.19 and 37.84 mmol min−1 g−1) together with large η (19.9%) are achieved even with λ > 560 nm focused vis-IR illumination. The higher activity with λ > 420 nm focused vis-IR illumination than with λ > 560 nm focused vis-IR illumination is mainly ascribed to the light intensity of the former (287.8 kW m−2) being higher than that of the latter (249.5 kW m−2).

3.3 Photothermocatalytic durability and coke resistance
Long-term photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 was tested with focused UV-Vis-IR illumination because catalyst durability is crucial to its practical application. As demonstrated in Fig. 6A, Pt/Co–Al2O3 demonstrates very good photothermocatalytic durability, evidenced by the observation of only a slight decrease in rH2 and rCO after a 50 h photothermocatalytic test. In striking contrast, Pt/Al2O3 quickly loses catalytic activity merely after a 5 h photothermocatalytic test (Fig. S5A†). This demonstrates that using Co doped Al2O3 instead of Al2O3 to support Pt nanoparticles tremendously promotes catalytic durability.

TG-MS curves of the used Pt/Co–Al2O3 catalyst after 50 h photothermocatalytic test (B). Coke deposition rates of Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 during the photothermocatalytic durability tests (C). 
TG-MS and TEM were used to characterize the used catalysts of Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 after the photothermocatalytic durability tests. TG analysis demonstrates that the used Pt/Co–Al2O3 sample after a 50 h photothermocatalytic test has a weight loss of 15.85% above 340 °C (Fig. 6B). The weight loss arises from the combustion of the formed coke to CO2, which is revealed by MS (Fig. 6B). The coke deposition rate (rC) during photothermocatalytic CRM is calculated on the basis of weight loss. As demonstrated in Fig. 6C, Pt/Co–Al2O3 has a quite small rC (3.77 × 10−3 gC gcatalyst−1 h−1). The TEM image shows the presence of carbon nanofibers for the used Pt/Co–Al2O3 sample (Fig. S6A†), consistent with the result of TG-MS. As shown in the HRTEM image, Pt nanoparticles of the used Pt/Co–Al2O3 catalyst demonstrate a distinct lattice spacing of {111} facets similar to fresh Pt/Co–Al2O3 (Fig. S6B†). This well explains why Pt/Co–Al2O3 has good photothermocatalytic durability (Fig. 6A).
TG analysis demonstrates that there is a weight loss of 22.49% above 200 °C for the used Pt/Al2O3 catalyst after a 5 h photothermocatalytic test (Fig. S5B†). Its rC is 5.80 × 10−2 gC gcatalyst−1 h−1 (Fig. 6C), 15.3 times higher than that of Pt/Co–Al2O3. This indicates that using Co doped Al2O3 instead of Al2O3 to support Pt nanoparticles tremendously blocks the side-reaction of coke deposition. The TEM image shows the presence of carbon nanofibers for the used Pt/Al2O3 sample (Fig. S7A†), consistent with the result of TG-MS. HRTEM demonstrates that the surface of the Pt nanoparticles of the used Pt/Al2O3 catalyst is blurred due to Pt nanoparticles being covered with amorphous carbon (Fig. S7B†). This leads to the reactant molecules of CH4 and CO2 being blocked from accessing the catalytically active sites of Pt nanoparticles, well explaining the quick deactivation of Pt/Al2O3 (Fig. S5A†).
3.4 Origin of promoted photothermocatalytic activity and coking resistance

3.4.1 CH4-TPD and CH4-TPO-CO2. 
In view of the CRM mechanism, CRM involves the steps of CH4 dissociation to H and CHx (x = 0–3), CO2 dissociation to O and CO, and CHx oxidization by O. Among them, the oxidation of carbon species acts as the rate-determining step of CRM because of its largest activation energy.45,46,52 In order to unveil why compared to Pt/Al2O3, loading Pt nanoparticles on Co–Al2O3 (Pt/Co–Al2O3) causes a tremendous promotion in both photothermocatalytic activity and coking resistance, we conducted temperature programmed CH4 dissociation (CH4-TPD) on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Co–Al2O3. CH4-TPD demonstrates that for CH4 dissociation on Pt/Al2O3, H2 formation starts at 398 °C on Pt/Al2O3 and a shoulder peak of H2 formation appears around about 563 °C (Fig. 7A). For CH4 dissociation on Pt/Co–Al2O3, H2 formation starts at 362 °C and a shoulder peak of H2 formation appears around about 463 °C. The H2 formation temperatures being significantly shifted to lower temperatures on Pt/Co–Al2O3 as compared to Pt/Al2O3 indicates that loading Pt nanoparticles on Co doped Al2O3 significantly promotes CH4 dissociation, thus enhancing catalytic activity (Fig. 4). We also conducted CH4-TPD on Al2O3 and Co–Al2O3. For CH4 dissociation on Al2O3, shoulder and sharp peaks of H2 formation appear around about 608 and 793 °C, far exceeding that of Pt/Al2O3. This indicates that CH4 dissociation on Pt/Al2O3 below 608 °C mainly occurs on Pt nanoparticles and/or the interface between Pt nanoparticles and Al2O3. For CH4 dissociation on Co–Al2O3, two sharp H2 formation peaks appear at 575 and 677 °C, far exceeding those of Pt/Co–Al2O3. This indicates that CH4 dissociation on Pt/Co–Al2O3 below 575 °C mainly occurs on Pt nanoparticles and/or the interface between Pt nanoparticles and Co–Al2O3. The H2 formation temperatures being significantly shifted to lower temperatures on Pt/Co–Al2O3 as compared to Pt/Al2O3 indicates that the formation of the Pt/Co–Al2O3 interface plays an important role in the promotion of CH4 dissociation.
 Fig. 7  H2 curves of CH4-TPD (A) and CO curves of CH4-TPO-CO2 (B) for Pt/Co–Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, Co–Al2O3, and Al2O3. 
Temperature programmed CH4 oxidation by pre-adsorbed CO2 (CH4-TPO-CO2) on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Co–Al2O3 was conducted. CH4-TPO-CO2 demonstrates that Pt/Al2O3 has a shoulder CO formation peak around 661 °C due to the oxidation of carbon species (produced by CH4 dissociation) by oxygen (produced by the dissociation of pre-adsorbed CO2) (Fig. 7B). The temperature for the oxidation of carbon species (661 °C) is much higher than that for CH4 dissociation (563 °C, Fig. 7A) on Pt/Al2O3, indicating that the oxidation of carbon species acts as the rate-determining step of CRM, consistent with the reported result.45,46,52 In striking contrast, Pt/Co–Al2O3 has a sharp CO formation peak at 482 °C (Fig. 7B), far less than that of Pt/Al2O3 (661 °C). This indicates that compared to Pt/Al2O3, loading Pt nanoparticles on Co–Al2O3 significantly promotes the oxidation of carbon species, thus significantly increasing the catalytic activity (Fig. 4). The promoted carbon oxidation on Pt/Co–Al2O3 is also favorable to blocking carbon species being polymerized to produce coke, thus significantly reducing the coke deposition rate as compared to Pt/Al2O3 (Fig. 6C).


3.4.2 Isotope labeling. 
To deeply unveil why the oxidation of carbon species on Pt/Co–Al2O3 is significantly promoted as compared to Pt/Al2O3, we conducted isotope labeling tests in which 12C18O2 is reduced by 12CH4 on Pt/Co–Al2O3 with focused UV-Vis-IR illumination. As demonstrated in Fig. 8A, accompanied by the attenuation for the peaks of 12C18O2 (at 2308 and 2324 cm−1) and 12CH4 (at 3016 cm−1), four peaks at 2081, 2116, 2127, and 2169 cm−1 are intensified. The two peaks around 2116 and 2169 cm−1 belong to 12C16O, and the two peaks around 2081 and 2127 cm−1 belong to 12C18O.38,47 The 12C16O formation demonstrates that the 16O atoms of Co–Al2O3 in Pt/Co–Al2O3 take part in the oxidation of carbon species. For CRM on Pt/Al2O3, only oxygen formed by CO2 dissociation on Pt nanoparticles participates in the oxidation of carbon species. In contrast, for CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3, both the active oxygen of Co–Al2O3 and oxygen formed by CO2 dissociation on Pt nanoparticles participate in the oxidation of carbon species. Thus, in comparison with Pt/Al2O3, the oxidation of carbon species on Pt/Co–Al2O3 is significantly promoted (Fig. 7B), not only improving catalytic activity (Fig. 4), but also blocking coke deposition on Pt/Co–Al2O3 (Fig. 6C).
 Fig. 8  The evolution of FTIR spectra for 12C18O2 reduction by 12C1H4 on Pt/Co–Al2O3 with focused UV-Vis-IR illumination time (A). Raman spectra of fresh Pt/Co–Al2O3 and the used Pt/Co–Al2O3 catalyst after the isotope labeling test (B). Note: in (A), a shoulder peak at 2343 cm−1 belongs to 12C18O16O,45,47 suggesting that the O atoms of Co–Al2O3 in Pt/Co–Al2O3 also take part in C18O oxidation. 
The O atoms of Co–Al2O3 in Pt/Co–Al2O3 participating in carbon oxidation are further verified by Raman spectroscopy. Fresh Pt/Co–Al2O3 demonstrates a peak around 679 cm−1 (Fig. 8B). The peak arises from the Co–16O stretching mode of Co–Al2O3 (ref. 47 and 53) because Raman peaks are not observed for Al2O3 owing to its intense fluorescence background.54 After the isotope labeling test, the Raman peak of the used Co–Al2O3 catalyst shifts from 679 cm−1 to a lower wavenumber (666 cm−1). The Raman shift unambiguously demonstrates the Co–16O bonds of Co–Al2O3 being changed to Co–18O. This arises from the reactions as follows: carbon species, produced by 12CH4 dissociation, are oxidized by the 16O atoms of Co–Al2O3 in Pt/Co–Al2O3 to 12C16O (Fig. 8A). The formed 16O vacancies in Co–Al2O3 are occupied by adsorbed 12C18O2, which is subsequently dissociated to 12C18O and 18O. Thus, 16O vacancies of Co–Al2O3 are replenished by 18O.

3.5 Role of light

3.5.1 Light-driven thermocatalysis. 
To unravel which role light plays in photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3, we measured the diffuse reflectance absorption of Pt/Co–Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and Co–Al2O3. As demonstrated in Fig. 9A, due to the surface plasmon absorption of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Al2O3 has absorption across the whole solar spectrum. In comparison with Pt/Al2O3, the absorption across the whole solar spectrum of Pt/Co–Al2O3 is substantially intensified. This arises from the intense absorption across the whole solar spectrum of Co–Al2O3 induced by Co doping (Fig. 9A).

The Teq values of the samples with focused illumination (C). The Teq values of Pt/Co–Al2O3 with focused vis-IR illumination (D). The sample holder has a high Teq value due to the IR heating effect of illumination. 
As proved by the photocatalytic test, Pt/Co–Al2O3 does not demonstrate catalytic activity for photocatalytic CRM (Fig. 9B). Therefore, the efficient photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 (Fig. 4) arises from light-driven thermocatalysis.
Focused illumination causes the surface temperature of Pt/Co–Al2O3 to rapidly elevate to an equilibrium temperature (Teq) due to its IR heating effect together with the photothermal conversion caused by the intense absorption of Pt/Co–Al2O3 (Fig. 9A). Light-driven thermocatalytic CRM occurs once Teq exceeds the light-off temperature (Tlight-off) of triggering thermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3.
To verify the mechanism, Teq and Tlight-off of Pt/Co–Al2O3 were measured. With focused UV-Vis-IR illumination, Pt/Co–Al2O3 shows a Teq value of 666 °C, which is higher than that of Pt/Al2O3 (605 °C). This is ascribed to the absorption of Pt/Co–Al2O3 being significantly intensified in comparison with Pt/Al2O3 (Fig. 9A), thus enhancing photothermal conversion. This is favorable for improving the photothermocatalytic activity of Pt/Co–Al2O3 as its thermocatalytic activity considerably increases with reaction temperature increase (Fig. 10A and B). As demonstrated by thermocatalytic CRM in the dark (Fig. 10A), Tlight-off of Pt/Co–Al2O3 is 520 °C or so. As Teq of Pt/Co–Al2O3 with focused UV-Vis-IR illumination (666 °C) far exceeds its Tlight-off (520 °C), efficient UV-Vis-IR light-driven thermocatalytic CRM occurs (Fig. 4). We also measured Teq of Pt/Co–Al2O3 with focused vis-IR illumination. With focused λ > 420 and 560 nm vis-IR illumination, Pt/Co–Al2O3 demonstrates Teq values of 622 and 583 °C (Fig. 9D), far exceeding its Tlight-off. Thus, efficient vis-IR light-driven thermocatalytic CRM occurs (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 10  Evolution of rCH4 (A) and rCO2 (B) with T, and corresponding evolution of ln(rCH4) with 1/T (C) for CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 in the dark and with focused illumination. 


3.5.2 Photoactivation. 
To reveal if light merely has a role of heating catalyst in photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3, we conducted the tests of catalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 in the dark and with focused illumination at different temperatures. At the same temperature above 520 °C, in comparison with those in the dark, rCH4 and rCO2 are considerably elevated with UV-Vis-IR illumination (Fig. 10A and B). Similarly, rCH4 and rCO2 are considerably elevated with both λ > 420 nm and λ > 560 nm vis-IR illumination (Fig. 10A and B). As Pt/Co–Al2O3 has no photocatalytic activity (Fig. 9B), and both Pt nanoparticles and Co–Al2O3 are not semiconductor photocatalysts, the light-induced catalytic enhancement (Fig. 10A and B) indicates the existence of a novel photoactivation, completely unlike conventional semiconductor photocatalysis.
On the basis of the rCH4 values of Pt/Co–Al2O3 at different temperatures (Fig. 10A), the evolution of Ln (rCH4) with 1/T is plotted. As demonstrated in (Fig. 10C), a linear relationship of ln(rCH4) vs. 1/T is observed. We calculated apparent activation energy (Ea,ap) using the Arrhenius equation (k = Ae−Ea/RT).
In the dark, Pt/Co–Al2O3 has an Ea,ap value of 57.5 kJ mol−1. With UV-Vis-IR illumination, Ea,ap considerably decreases from 57.5 to 41.6 kJ mol−1. Similarly, with λ > 420 or 560 nm illumination, Ea,ap also considerably decreases to 45.0 or 45.7 kJ mol−1. This demonstrates that the photoactivation considerably decreases Ea,ap, resulting in the catalytic enhancement.
To deeply unveil the photoactivation, the impact of UV-Vis-IR illumination on the CRM steps of CH4 dissociation and carbon oxidation on Pt/Co–Al2O3 was investigated. CH4-TPD demonstrates that the shoulder H2 formation peak obviously shifts to a lower temperature with UV-Vis-IR illumination in comparison with that in the dark (Fig. 11A). This demonstrates that UV-Vis-IR illumination promotes CH4 dissociation on Pt/Co–Al2O3, helpful for enhancing catalytic activity (Fig. 10). More importantly, CH4-TPO-CO2 demonstrates that in comparison with that in the dark, the CO formation peak significantly shifts from 482 °C to 400 °C with UV-Vis-IR illumination (Fig. 11B). This demonstrates that UV-Vis-IR illumination significantly promotes the oxidation of carbon species (the rate-determining step of CRM as discussed above) on Pt/Co–Al2O3, well explaining the catalytic enhancement (Fig. 10A and B).

4. Conclusions
In summary, loading Pt nanoparticles on Co doped Al2O3 instead of Al2O3 not only significantly improves catalytic activity and light-to-fuel conversion, but also tremendously blocks the side-reactions of coke deposition, thus improving catalytic durability for photothermocatalytic CRM. Compared to Pt/Al2O3, rCO, rH2, and η of Pt/Co–Al2O3 are significantly enhanced by 5.4, 6.0, and 6.2 times, respectively, while its rC is reduced by 15.3 times. The significantly promoted photothermocatalytic performance arises from the following aspects: (1) the formation of the Pt/Co–Al2O3 interface significantly promotes CH4 dissociation, thus improving catalytic activity. (2) The active oxygen of Co doped Al2O3 participates in the oxidation of carbon species (rate-determining step of CRM), thus not only improving catalytic activity, but also blocking carbon species being polymerized to form coke. (3) The intense absorption across the whole solar spectra of Co doped Al2O3 substantially intensifies the photothermal conversion of Pt/Co–Al2O3, thus improving catalytic activity. (4) For photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3, light not only plays a heating role, but also substantially decreases activation energy due to the oxidation of carbon species being significantly promoted with illumination, thus increasing the catalytic activity. This work is helpful for realizing highly efficient solar fuel production from CO2 and solar-to-fuel conversion by rationally designing nanostructured catalysts.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  XRD patterns of Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3.	 

 	Fig. 2  TEM image (A), HAADF image (B), and size distribution of Pt nanoparticles (C), and HRTEM image (D) of Pt/Co–Al2O3.	 

 	Fig. 3  XPS spectra of Al 2p, O 1s, Co 2p, and Pt 4d for Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3.	 

 	Fig. 4  The values of rCO2 and rCH4 (A), rCO and rH2 (B), and η (C) for photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, Co–Al2O3, and Al2O3 with focused UV-Vis-IR illumination. As Pt/Al2O3 quickly loses catalytic activity (Fig. S5A†), the data for Pt/Al2O3 in Fig. 4 are those after the initial 10 min.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 5  The values of rCO2 and rCH4 (A), rCO and rH2 (B), and η (C) for photothermocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 with focused vis-IR illumination.	 

 	Fig. 6  Long-term time course of photothermocatalytic activity of Pt/Co–Al2O3 with focused UV-Vis-IR illumination (A). TG-MS curves of the used Pt/Co–Al2O3 catalyst after 50 h photothermocatalytic test (B). Coke deposition rates of Pt/Co–Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 during the photothermocatalytic durability tests (C).	 

 	Fig. 7  H2 curves of CH4-TPD (A) and CO curves of CH4-TPO-CO2 (B) for Pt/Co–Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, Co–Al2O3, and Al2O3.	 

 	Fig. 8  The evolution of FTIR spectra for 12C18O2 reduction by 12C1H4 on Pt/Co–Al2O3 with focused UV-Vis-IR illumination time (A). Raman spectra of fresh Pt/Co–Al2O3 and the used Pt/Co–Al2O3 catalyst after the isotope labeling test (B). Note: in (A), a shoulder peak at 2343 cm−1 belongs to 12C18O16O,45,47 suggesting that the O atoms of Co–Al2O3 in Pt/Co–Al2O3 also take part in C18O oxidation.	 

 	Fig. 9  Diffuse reflectance absorption of the samples (A) (R denotes reflectance). Photocatalytic CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 with UV-Vis-IR illumination at near ambient temperature (B). The Teq values of the samples with focused illumination (C). The Teq values of Pt/Co–Al2O3 with focused vis-IR illumination (D). The sample holder has a high Teq value due to the IR heating effect of illumination.	 

 	Fig. 10  Evolution of rCH4 (A) and rCO2 (B) with T, and corresponding evolution of ln(rCH4) with 1/T (C) for CRM on Pt/Co–Al2O3 in the dark and with focused illumination.	 

 	Fig. 11  H2 curves for CH4-TPD (A) and CO curves for CH4-TPO-CO2 (B) on Pt/Co–Al2O3 in the dark and with UV-Vis-IR illumination.
