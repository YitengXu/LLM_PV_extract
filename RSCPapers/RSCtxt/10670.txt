    , Accepted 3rd September 2018First published on 13th September 2018AbstractHalide ion diffusion in organolead halide perovskites has raised great concern in recent years and been considered as the reason for the hysteresis of current–voltage curves and degradation of perovskite solar cells. In this work, X-site halide ion diffusion in lead-free double perovskites Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br), Cs2AgSbCl6 and Cs2AgInCl6 is investigated by first-principles calculations. The formation energies of X-site vacancies are calculated for these double perovskites, and predicted to be related to the electronic configurations of B-site cations. Cs2AgInCl6 is found to have the lowest vacancy formation energy among these double perovskites due to the unfilled s-orbitals of In3+. Using the climbing-image nudged elastic band method, these double perovskites are found with different barriers for halide ion migrations around Ag- and BIII-octahedrons due to different migration bottleneck radii and B–X bond characters. In our calculations Cs2AgBiBr6 shows the lowest energy barrier for X-site ion migration, which can explain the phenomenon of the huge hysteresis in Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells reported. These results reveal X-site vacancy formation and diffusion properties in these lead-free halide double perovskites, which could be useful theoretical support for their optoelectronic application.
1. Introduction
Organolead halide perovskite solar cells are currently the fastest-growing photovoltaic (PV) technology with an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE).1–5 After the first pioneering work of Miyasaka et al., the PCE of organolead halide perovskite solar cells has been rapidly increased to NREL-certified 23.3% in a few years. In addition to the high PCE, a low-temperature solution-processed method and composition of earth-abundant elements also make perovskites the most promising light-harvesting materials for next generation solar cells.6–8 However, some problems, e.g., the low chemical stability in ambient air and the environmental risk of lead leaching, are still the inescapable concerns in the widespread application of organolead halide perovskite solar cells.9,10 Therefore, much effort has been devoted to explore alternative lead-free stable light absorbers for perovskite solar cells.11–18
As the adjacent element of lead in the periodic table, bismuth is gradually attracting attention for optoelectronic applications due to the same electronic configuration (5d106s26p0) as lead for their stable cations. However, different oxidation states prohibit the direct replacement of Pb2+ by Bi3+ in perovskite structures, which will induce the phase transition from the three-dimensional corner-sharing octahedral structure to the two-dimensional layered derivative. An alternative possibility of realizing the Bi-based perovskite retaining the three-dimensional corner-sharing octahedral structure is to construct an A2BIBIIIX6 double perovskite structure, e.g., replacing Pb2+ cations with Bi3+ and monovalent BI cations in a 1:1 ratio. These double perovskites are demonstrated to possess excellent stability against moisture and are eco-friendly.19 Moreover, the electronic band gaps of these double perovskites decrease with the X-site elements in the order Cl, Br and I similar to organolead halide perovskites, e.g., the band gaps of Ag-Bi halide perovskites decrease from 2.7 eV of Cs2AgBiCl6 to 1.6 eV of Cs2AgBiI6,20 indicating the promising potential in the application of solar energy conversion. Although a series of lead-free halide double perovskites is predicted to have the optical band gap (1.1–1.6 eV), only a few Ag-containing chlorides or bromides (i.e., Cs2AgBiCl6, Cs2AgBiBr6, Cs2AgSbCl6 and Cs2AgInCl6) have been to date synthesized by the solid state reaction and solution processing methods.21–25 Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells have achieved a PCE of 2.5% with the open-circuit voltage exceeding one volt, showing promising potential as a light absorber.26 In addition, these lead-free halide double perovskites, except for the light absorber, exhibit promising potential in other optoelectronic applications such as photodetectors and photocatalysts.27–29
The ion diffusion plays an important role in the electronic properties of perovskite materials. For instance, transition metal oxide perovskites that are employed as the electrode materials of solid oxide fuel cells usually show mixed ionic and electronic conductivity. This conductivity could enhance the rate of oxygen reduction/evolution reactions, which is conducive to reduce the operating temperature of solid oxide fuel cells.30–33 For organolead halide perovskites, halide ion diffusion is considered to be the reason for the degradation reaction and the anomalous hysteresis of the current–voltage curves.34–36 Therefore, investigation on halide ion diffusion is significant to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells. The B-site ordered double perovskites would have different ion migration features due to the alternative arrangement of BIX6 and BIIIX6 octahedrons. A comprehensive understanding of the halide ion diffusion in lead-free halide double perovskites could promote their potential optoelectronic applications. In this work, we presented the theoretical investigation of halide ion migration in lead-free double perovskites Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br), Cs2AgSbCl6 and Cs2AgInCl6 by first-principles calculations. The formation energy of X-site vacancies and migration energy barriers are analyzed to reveal the ion diffusion mechanism, which would be useful for these compounds in the optoelectronic applications.
2. Computational methods
All calculations in this work have been carried out by using Quantum ESPRESSO package based on the planewave/pseudopotential approach.37,38 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) was used for the exchange–correlation functional.39 Plane wave cutoffs of 40 and 320 Ry were set to expand the wave function and density, respectively. The 40-atom supercells were employed to calculate the lattice parameters and electronic properties of these halide double perovskites and the 4 × 4 × 4 Monkhorst–Pack k-mesh grid was used for Brillouin zone integration.40 The lattice constants and atomic positions were fully optimized until the stresses were less than 10−4 Ry bohr−3 and the residual forces were less than 10−3 Ry bohr−1 on each atomic site. The energy barriers of halide ion migrations in these double perovskites were studied by the climbing-image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method.41–44 To simulate the halide ion migration, 80-atom supercells were used to calculate the vacancy formation energy and optimize the minimum energy pathway of halide ion migration. Five images were linearly interpolated between the initial and final states, and the force was set to converge within 0.05 eV Å−1 during the migration process.45–47 The spring force along the migration path was adopted during intermediate state optimization to ensure the finding of the lowest energy paths.
3. Results and discussion
These lead-free halide double perovskites show cubic symmetry with space group Fm3m as depicted in Fig. 1a. Unlike the single perovskite, these materials are composed of corner-sharing octahedrons with the rock-salt ordering of BI and BIII. To assess the halide ion diffusion, we fully relaxed the lattice parameters of these double perovskites based on the experimental crystal structures, which are presented in Table 1. We can find that both lattice constants and bond lengths of these halide double perovskites are slightly overestimated by our calculations, which can be ascribed to the common flaw of the GGA method. The lattice constants are related to the ionic radii of elements. For instance, the lattice constant of Cs2AgBiBr6 is larger than that of Cs2AgBiCl6 because of a larger ionic radius of Br− than that of Cl−, and the lattice constant of Cs2AgSbCl6 is smaller than that of Cs2AgBiCl6 due to the smaller ionic radius of the Sb3+ cation.48 However, one can note that the lattice constant of Cs2AgInCl6 is smaller than that of Cs2AgSbCl6 even though the ionic radius of In3+ is larger than that of the Sb3+ cation.48 Besides, the bond length of Ag and Br is optimized to be shorter than that of Bi and Br in Cs2AgBiBr6, which is opposite to the measured result. These unexpected results are possibly due to the lone-pair electron interaction of BIII cations. The calculated density of state (DOS) results (shown in Fig. 1b) reveal that although upper valence bands are mainly composed of Ag-d and X-p states, s-electrons of Bi or Sb cations also contribute to the upper valence bands of Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br) and Cs2AgSbCl6. For Cs2AgInCl6, s-electrons of In cations are predicted at the lower conduction bands, indicating the bonding combination of In-s and Cl-p orbitals. The different electronic configurations would finally affect ion diffusion properties in these lead-free halide double perovskite compounds.

Considering the ionic radius and octahedron structure, the X-site vacancy would be the dominant defect in perovskites. According to the vacancy-mediated hopping mechanism, the higher concentration of the vacancy means the higher probability of ion hopping. Therefore, we firstly calculated the formation energy of the X-site vacancy for these lead-free halide double perovskites, which to some degree reveals the relative concentration of the X-site vacancy formed in these compounds. The formation energy ΔEf can be calculated according to ΔEf = Edeficient − Eperfect + Evacancy, where Edeficient is the total energy of the supercell containing the vacancy, Eperfect is the total energy of the corresponding perfect supercell, and Evacancy is the total energy of vacant species in a pure elemental solid or molecule. The calculated formation energies of X-site vacancies in these halide double perovskites are listed in Table 2. We can note that Cs2AgInCl6 has the lowest vacancy formation energy, indicating the highest concentration of X-site vacancies among these halide double perovskites. The formation energy of the Br vacancy in Cs2AgBiBr6 is lower than that of the Cl vacancy in Cs2AgBiCl6, suggesting that the formation of the Br vacancy is easier than that of the Cl vacancy in a certain octahedron. The decomposition enthalpy (ΔH, defined as the free energy difference of the reactant and product, ΔH = E[AX] + 2E[BIX] + E[BIIIX3] − E[A2BIBIIIX6]) of these double perovskites has been investigated, demonstrating that the thermodynamic stability increases in the order Cs2AgBiBr6, Cs2AgSbCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6.50 This is consistent with the result of the formation energy of X-site vacancies in these materials.

The vacancy formation process can be considered in terms of two steps: the bond breakage of B–X and the redistribution of extra electrons left behind. In oxide perovskites, constructing a double perovskite structure is able to reduce the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, by modifying the accommodation capacity of the BO6 octahedron for excess electrons.32,51 This electron redistribution can be studied by calculating the charge density difference Δρ according to Δρ = ρdefecient + ρO − ρperfect (where ρdefecient, ρO and ρperfect are the charge density of vacancy-containing supercells, a corresponding single atom on the vacant site and the defect-free supercells, respectively). As displayed in Fig. 2, upon removal of one neutral X-site atom, excess electrons in Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br) and Cs2AgSbCl6 mainly reorganize onto the high energy p-orbital of adjacent Bi3+ or Sb3+ cations. While in Cs2AgInCl6, additional electrons from the Cl vacancy prefer to occupy the s-orbital of the neighboring In3+ cation. In this case, the low energy states of the In3+ s-orbital accommodate these additional electrons, thereby lowering the formation energy of the Cl vacancy in Cs2AgInCl6.

For perovskites with a three-dimensional corner-sharing octahedral structure, the X-site anion diffusion can be simulated according to the vacancy-mediated hopping mechanism.44,51,52 The migration process contains two steps: the X-site vacancy formation and the hopping of the neighboring anion onto the vacant site along the octahedral edge. The hopping process induces the electron transfer between the initial and final states through the B–X bond, and thus the CINEB method is a feasible strategy to study the energy barrier of X-site ion migration in perovskites. To realize the long-range diffusion in these lead-free double perovskites, the X-site halide ions must consecutively migrate around both Ag and BIII octahedral cages. We calculated energy profiles of halide ion migrations in these double perovskites, which are illustrated in Fig. 3. As can be seen the activation energies are different for halide ion migrations around Ag and BIII. This energy difference in Cs2AgInCl6 is calculated to be the largest one among these double perovskites. Due to the alternate arrangement of Ag/BIII cations, the higher barrier ultimately determines the activation energy of long-range halide ion diffusion. Therefore, although the barrier of Cl migration around the In-octahedron has the lowest value, Cs2AgInCl6 has the highest activation energy among these compounds. For Bi- or Sb-containing double perovskites, the differences of energy barriers between Ag- and BIII-octahedrons are not as remarkable as that of Cs2AgInCl6. The migration barriers around Ag-octahedrons are slightly higher than those of Bi-octahedrons in Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br), while the migration barrier around the Ag-octahedron is lower than that of the Sb-octahedron in Cs2AgSbCl6. The energy barrier of Br migration in Cs2AgBiBr6 is found to be lower than that of Cl migration in double perovskites Cs2AgBIIICl6, and also lower than that of I migration in MAPbI3 or FAPbI3, suggesting the high diffusion rate.34 This high diffusion rate would induce a huge hysteresis and affect the device performance of Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite solar cells, which has been evidenced by Greul et al.26 To improve the performance of lead-free double perovskite solar cells, the halide ion migration should be suppressed by further effort (e.g., modifying the morphology and structural stability of the double perovskite thin films).53
 Fig. 3  Calculated energy profiles of halide ion migrations around Ag (orange line) and BIII (blue line) in these lead-free double perovskites. 
During the migration process, X-site ions need to pass through the bottleneck that is constructed by the bonded B-site cation and two adjacent A-site cations as shown in Fig. 4.54,55 A large bottleneck will be favorable to decrease the migration barrier. The bottleneck radii of halide ion migrations are calculated for Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br), Cs2AgSbCl6 and Cs2AgInCl6, which are summarized in Table 3. Giving the double perovskite structure that A- and B-site cations occupy 4b and 4a Wyckoff positions, respectively, the bottleneck radii are determined by the lattice constant and ionic radii of A and B cations. For Ag-octahedrons of these double perovskites, the trend of bottleneck radius is similar to that of lattice constant in consideration of the same ionic radii of A-site Cs+ and B-site Ag+. While for BIII-octahedrons, bottleneck radii are different due to unequal radii of Bi3+, Sb3+ and In3+. Cs2AgBiBr6 is found to have the largest bottleneck for Ag- and BIII-octahedrons, which is consistent with the predicted migration barrier. We should note that the ionic radius of Br is as well larger than that of Cl. Thus, the result should not be directly compared between Cs2AgBiBr6 and the other three compounds. An exception is the energy barrier of Cl migration around the In-octahedron. The bottleneck radius is smaller than that of the Sb-octahedron but the barrier is the lowest one among these double perovskites. This can be attributed to the empty s-orbital of In3+ cations. During the migration, electrons will be transferred with halide ions migrating from the initial state to the final state. In this case, the unfulfilled s-orbital of In3+ could accommodate the additional electrons, resulting in the lower migration barrier. Therefore, we can see that both the bottleneck radius and the electronic configuration of B-site cations are critical to the halide ion migration process, suggesting that B-site cation substitution is a potential strategy to modify the halide ion diffusion in lead-free halide double perovskites.

4. Conclusion
To summarize, we have reported a theoretical study of X-site halide ion migrations in lead-free halide double perovskites Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Cl, Br), Cs2AgSbCl6 and Cs2AgInCl6. The vacancy formation energy and halide ion migration barrier in these double perovskites are calculated based on density functional theory. Cs2AgInCl6 is calculated to have the lowest formation energy of the Cl vacancy, resulting from the empty s-orbital of In3+ cations. This reveals that the electronic configuration of B-site cations plays an important role in the formation of halide ion vacancies. The formation energy of the Br vacancy is lower than that of the Cl vacancy, indicating a higher halide vacancy concentration in Cs2AgBiBr6. The barriers of halide ion migrations around Ag- and BIII-octahedrons are predicted to be different for these double perovskites. The migration barriers for Ag-octahedrons are higher than those of BIII-octahedrons in addition to Cs2AgSbCl6. Similar to the vacancy formation energy, the migration barrier of Br is lower than that of Cl, suggesting a higher Br diffusion rate in Cs2AgBiBr6. For double perovskites, both the migration bottleneck radius and the electronic configurations of B-site cations should be responsible for the energy barrier of halide ion migration. These results reveal the migration properties of halide ions in these lead-free double perovskites, which could be useful theoretical support for their optoelectronic applications.
