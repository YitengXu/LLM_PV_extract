    , Accepted 16th January 2019First published on 16th January 2019AbstractInspired by the structure of pomegranates, an intriguing pomegranate-like microflower (PM-NixSy) confining core–shell binary nickel sulfide (β-NiS/Ni3S4) nanobeads has been constructed for the first time, which contributes to breaking through the bottleneck of poor cycle performance for nickel sulfide-based supercapacitors (SCs).

PM-NixSy//PG asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) are assembled and achieve an attractive energy density of 88 W h kg−1 at a power density of 810 W kg−1. More importantly, 97.6% of the initial capacitance is still retained even after 100000 cycles at 5 A g−1 for PM-NixSy//PG ASCs, displaying their unprecedented durable cycling life. On this basis, ASCs can be recharged by sustainable solar energy and repeatedly supply power to various electronics without a decline of electrochemical performance. Therefore, this work presents a facile route to design a pomegranate-like microflower for SCs with durable cycling performance that can be applied to store sustainable energy.
Introduction
Supercapacitors (SCs) are regarded as an important power source meeting the increasing demand of energy storage and conversion because of their fast charge/discharge process, high power density and relatively low cost.1,2 However, due to the moderate electrochemical performance of carbon materials used in commercial SCs, it is urgent to develop excellent alternatives exhibiting better electrochemical behaviors. Nickel sulfides (NixSy) have been considered as one of the most important types of electrode materials for SCs, owing to their high theoretical capacitance and redox activity.3–5 Unfortunately, the practical exploration of nickel sulfides has been severely hindered by their mediocre cycling performance upon extended cycling.6–8 For instance, Zhu et al. prepared hierarchical NiS hollow spheres for SCs, which delivered a high specific capacitance of 927 F g−1 at a charge/discharge current density of 4.08 A g−1. However, only about 52.9% of their initial capacitance was retained after 3000 cycles at 4.2 A g−1.9 This dissatisfactory cycling stability is mainly ascribed to the poor structural stability of nickel sulfide-based electrode materials, due to the large volume change of nickel sulfides during recurring redox reaction processes.10,11 Consequently, the main bottleneck in the use of nickel sulfides is how to develop nickel sulfide-based electrode materials with their integral structure possessing sturdy stability.
Recently, multicomponent metal compounds have come to the research forefront as electrode materials, which can effectively buffer the volume change during cycling.4,12–15 Therefore, the design of multicomponent metal compounds has become a vital method to enhance the electrochemical cycling stability of metal compound electrode materials. According to Ho's report, the synergistic effect of the yolk–shell structure and uniform mixing of SnS and MoS2 nanocrystals resulted in the durable electrochemical cycling properties of the yolk–shell SnS–MoS2 composite microspheres by improving their structural stability during cycling.15 Very recently, a kind of 3D hierarchical microcapsule structure (NiSx@NCV), in which dual-NiSx (α-NiS/NiS2) nanoparticles are confined in the compartment of N-doped carbon vesicles,5 was reported and delivered a higher cycling stability than single NiS2@NCV during 5000 cycles. Nevertheless, multicomponent metal compounds tend to aggregate, which is detrimental to charge transport and ion diffusion in electrodes, resulting in a decrease of electrochemical performance in terms of cycle life.16–18 For example, dual NiS/Ni3S4 nanosheets exhibited moderate cycling stability with a lower capacitance retention of 86% after 10000 cycles at 3 A g−1.7
To resolve this problem, a promising strategy is to combine nickel sulfides with graphene, which can immobilize NixSy nanoparticles to prevent the aggregation of NixSy nanoparticles during cycling.19–23 For instance, Li et al. prepared NiS2/rGO for SCs, wherein 89.3% of its initial capacitance was retained after 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1, much higher than that of pristine NiS2 (60%).23 In spite of the enhanced durability of cycling performance, these nickel sulfide/graphene composites still can hardly meet the demand for practical applications especially during long-term cycling due to the natural tendency to restack graphene nanosheets.24,25 Very recently, extensive attention has been paid to the design of three dimensional (3D) graphene-based composites to inhibit the restacking of two-dimensional graphene sheets.1,26–28 It is anticipated that control over the morphology and assembly of 3D graphene-based composites with a high surface area as well as abundant accessible reaction sites could result in unifying structural stability with a long cycle life and high electronic/ionic conductivities.29–31 Recently, advances in the design of 3D graphene-based composites include the synthesis of 3D graphene-encapsulated Fe2O3 nanoparticles,32 the preparation of hierarchical micro-spherical MoS2-graphene composites,30 the design of micro-spherical sulphur/graphene oxide composites33etc. Since the restacking of graphene has been resolved, these 3D architectures displayed enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of cycling stability. Lee et al. presented 3D crumpled graphene-decorated Fe3O4 nanoparticles for SCs, showing a stable cycling life (maintaining over 80% of the specific capacitance after 2000 cycles) at a current density of 2 A g−1.34 In these 3D architectures, the integrating force associated with van der Waals' interactions or chemical bonding between graphene and active units in these 3D architectures is propitious to well maintain the integrity of structure when suffering a large volume change of active units. To the best of our knowledge, there have been almost no reports on the construction of 3D microspherical nickel sulfides@graphene with a porous structure and multicomponent metal compounds used for SCs showing durable cycling stability during long-term cycling.
In this work, bioinspired pomegranate-like microflowers confining core–shell binary NixSy nanobeads (PM-NixSy) have been developed, which is realized by a facile spray drying process combined with the pyrolysis and in situ nanospace-confined sulfidation strategy. The obtained 3D PM-NixSy possesses an open nano–micro-porous structure, in which the core–shell binary NixSy (Ni3S4/β-NiS) nanobeads are well confined in the compartment of 3D graphene flowers. On one hand, the synergistic effect of the binary core–shell composition of Ni3S4 and β-NiS nanocrystals can buffer the volume change of NixSy nanobeads during cycling. On the other hand, the 3D pomegranate-like microflowers provide firm structural stability to accommodate the mechanical stresses induced by redox reactions.
Benefiting from the intriguing architecture, PM-NixSy delivers a high specific capacity of 323.8 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 and shows almost no capacity change after repeated charge–discharge processes (capacity retention over 98.9% after 100000 cycles). Such a durable cycling stability is considerably higher than that of previously reported nickel sulfide/graphene-based electrodes, especially considering that the reports of nickel sulfides as SC electrode materials with a lifespan exceeding 5000 cycles are scarce.19–23,35 This is due to the robust structural integrity of PM-NixSy in redox reactions, which is strongly confirmed by XRD measurements. By pairing with porous graphene microspheres (PG), a kind of high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) was fabricated (denoted as PM-NixSy//PG), achieving an attractive energy density up to 88 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.81 kW kg−1. More importantly, the whole devices display an unprecedented durable cycling life (capacitance retention of 97.6% after 100000 cycles at 5 A g−1), superior to those of previous nickel sulfide-based ASCs.36–38 On this basis, ASCs can be effectively recharged by sustainable solar energy and repeatedly supply power to various electronics, such as lighting up a red lamp and making a miniature game machine work properly, without a decline of electrochemical performance. Considering the facile and easy large-scale fabrication technology as well as the outstanding performance, this work sheds light on a new generation of high performance SCs with a durable lifespan that can be applied to sustainable energy systems.
Experimental
Synthesis of Ni@G
All of the reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized using natural graphite (Alfa Aesar, 325 mesh, 99.8%) by a modified Hummers' method. Typically, 20 mL GO solution (1 mg mL−1; the atomic force microscope (AFM) image of graphene oxide sheets is shown in Fig. S1†) was added to 50 mL nickel acetate solution (20 mg mL−1), followed by sonication for 3 h. Sequentially, the as-prepared brownish black suspension was injected into the nozzle of a lab-scale spray dryer. The imported suspension is pulverized by the shear force from the pressurized nitrogen with a pressure in the range of 200–400 kPa, spraying out tiny droplets of NiAc2/GO suspension through the orifice of the nozzle. The liquid droplets quickly evaporated upon contact with the carrier gas of 200 °C hot air passing through the chamber of the dryer, resulting in dry and stable porous NiAc2@GO microspheres. The collected brown powder was calcined at 600 °C for 3 h under an Ar atmosphere. After cooling to room temperature, the products were obtained and stored in an argon glove box, denoted as Ni@G. More information about Ni@G is provided in Fig. S2 and S3.†
Synthesis of PM-NixSy
0.5 g Ni@G and 0.6 g thiourea were mixed in argon glove box and loaded in a 20 mL autoclave with a Teflon cup. After being tightly sealed, the autoclave was transferred into an oven and heated at 160 °C or 180 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was collected and washed with ethanol several times and finally dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight. The samples heated at 160 °C and 180 °C were denoted as NiS@G and PM-NixSy, respectively. As control experiments, dipped-molded NixSy@G (denoted as DM-NixSy@G) was prepared with the same procedure as that for PM-NixSy but using ordinary dipping-molding drying instead of spray drying.
Synthesis of porous graphene microspheres
GO powder was prepared by spray drying, then activated by KOH solution and calcined at 800 °C for 2 h in an Ar atmosphere, resulting in porous graphene microspheres (denoted as PG). More information about porous graphene microspheres is shown in Fig. S4 and S5.†
Assembling of ASCs
A two-electrode cell configuration was assembled using 2 M KOH as the electrolyte, PM-NixSy pressed on graphite paper as the positive electrode and PG pressed on graphite paper as the negative electrode, respectively. PVA–KOH gel electrolyte was prepared with 3 g KOH, 3 g polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and 60 mL of deionized water. The working electrodes were made from 80% active materials, 10% carbon black, and 10% binder (polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)). The slurry was pasted on graphite paper using a medical blade. The working electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. Each electrode contains a certain quantity of the active material, with a geometric surface area of about 3 × 2 cm2. The loading mass ratio between positive and negative materials was optimized according to reported methods, which is based on the fact that the charge (q) between two electrodes maintains balance (q+ = q−). The charge stored in each electrode usually depends on the specific capacitance (C), the potential window of the working electrode (ΔV) and the mass of the electrode (m) (q = C × ΔV × m).
Characterization methods
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI Sirion 200) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010F) were carried out to characterize the morphology of the samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a powder XRD system with Cu Kα radiation. Nitrogen absorption and desorption measurements were performed with an Autosorb IQ instrument at 77 K. The specific surface areas were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the pore size distributions were determined from the adsorption branch of the isotherms based on density functional theory (DFT). All the electrochemical measurements were carried out using a VMP3 multi-functional electrochemical analysis instrument (Bio-Logic, France). Electrochemical behaviors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods using a VMP3 multi-functional electrochemical analysis instrument (Bio-Logic, France). The CV and GCD tests were performed at various scan rates and current densities. The EIS plots were recorded in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with 5 mV AC amplitude. The specific capacitance, and energy and power density of the assembled ASCs were calculated from the galvanostatic discharge curve according to the two-electrode systematic calculation method: C = 4IΔt/mΔV(1) E = C(ΔV)2/7.2(2) P = 3600E/Δt(3)where C (F g−1) is the specific capacitance, E (W h kg−1) is the energy density, P (W kg−1) is the power density, I is the discharge current, Δt is the discharge time, ΔV is the voltage variation during the discharge process after “IR drop”, and m (mg) is the electrode weight. Additionally, the electrochemical performances and specific capacitance of single PM-NixSy, NiS@G, DM-NixSy@G or PG electrodes are measured and calculated according to the three-electrode systematic method. The specific capacitance of pomegranate-like microflowers was calculated by using the following equation:39 (4)C (F g−1) represents the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) specific capacitance. im = I/m (A g−1) is the current density, where I is the current and m is the active mass of the electrode.  is the integral current area, where V is the potential with initial and final values of Vi and Vf, respectively.
Electrochemical measurements
All the electrochemical measurements were carried out using a VMP3 multi-functional electrochemical analysis instrument (Bio-Logic, France). Electrochemical behaviors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance (EIS) methods. The CV and GCD tests were performed at various scan rates and current densities. The EIS plots were recorded in the frequency range from 0.05 Hz to 100 kHz with 5 mV AC amplitude. The working electrode was prepared by mixing our samples (NiS@G, PM-NixSy, DM-NixSy@G or PG) with acetylene black and polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) as the binder dissolved in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1. The resulting slurry was pressed onto the Ni foam current collector as the working electrode. Platinum (Pt) foil and Hg/HgO electrodes were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All tests were conducted in a 2 M KOH electrolyte.

Ex situ X-ray diffraction
Before starting the ex situ XRD test, cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 has been conducted for 50 cycles to stabilize the electrochemical signature of the electrodes. For ex situ XRD experiments, electrodes were charged and discharged at a current density of 5 A g−1, and the stop positions of the GCD test are shown in Fig. 4. Once the electrodes were charged and discharged to a desired voltage point, the GCD test was paused and the electrodes were lifted out of the KOH solution to be washed clean and then tested by XRD analysis. After XRD analysis, the electrodes continued the unfinished GCD test until the next desired voltage point and were lifted out of the KOH solution to be washed clean and then tested by XRD analysis. The above steps were repeated until getting all the XRD patterns of NiS@G, PM-NixSy and DM-NixSy@G electrodes at various constant potentials.
Results and discussion
A schematic illustration of the detailed evolution process of the 3D pomegranate-like PM-NixSy microflowers confining core–shell binary NixSy nanobeads is presented in Fig. 1a. Initially, the prepared graphene oxide (GO) solution was sonicated with nickel acetate (NiAc2) in deionized water, while nickel ions adsorbed to the surface of graphene oxide under electrostatic interaction. Sequentially, the as-prepared mixture was pumped into a spray drying apparatus and dried in the cylinder, during which GO nanosheets spontaneously assembled on the surface of the droplets due to their amphiphilicity, subsequently shrank and encapsulated NiAc2.32 Next, graphene flowers confining Ni atoms (Ni@G) were obtained through a subsequent calcination in an Ar atmosphere. Finally, the Ni@G was subjected to a direct sulfidation and in situ formed core–shell binary NixSy nanobeads confined in graphene flowers (PM-NixSy). For comparison, NiS@G was prepared by the same spray drying and calcination procedures as those for PM-NixSy, except for the lower sulfidation temperature. Dipped-molded NixSy@G (denoted as DM-NixSy@G) was synthesized with the same procedure as that for PM-NixSy but using ordinary dipping-molding drying instead of spray drying. More information about NiS@G and DM-NixSy@G is provided in Fig. S6–S8.†

As shown in the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images (Fig. 1b and c), it could be clearly observed that the PM-NixSy presents a pomegranate-like shape with diameters of about 1–1.5 μm, wherein NixSy nanobeads are highly confined in the graphene flowers and the graphene flowers show a typical crumpled and rippled morphology, which could effectively prevent irreversible aggregation and restacking of graphene nanosheets originating from their strong van der Waals attractions.25 A deep insight into the PM-NixSy microflowers is obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, showing that almost all the NixSy nanobeads are intertwined together by graphene flowers (Fig. 1d and f). It is worth mentioning that each pomegranate-like PM-NixSy microflower is cross-linked with crumpled ultrathin graphene nanosheets, wherein graphene serves as a highway for electron transportation and ensures that all NixSy nanobeads are interconnected and linked, thus preserving obviously enhanced structural integrity compared to previously reported nickel sulfide-based composites.7,35,38 Remarkably, the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image and elemental mapping images (C, Ni and S atoms) in Fig. 1e further indicate that C, Ni and S elements are uniformly distributed in the pomegranate-like PM-NixSy microflowers. A deep insight into NixSy nanobeads is obtained by high resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis (Fig. 1g), displaying amorphous graphene and the lattice interplanar spacings of around 0.295 and 0.540 nm corresponding to the distances of the (101) plane of β-NiS40 and (111) plane of Ni3S4,41 respectively (Fig. 1g). Moreover, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern is consistent with the results of HRTEM, exhibiting both the typical peaks indexed to β-NiS (JCPDS no. 12-0041) and Ni3S4 (JCPDS no. 47-1739) (Fig. 1h). These results indicate that the core–shell binary NixSy nanobeads with two different crystal structures (Fig. 1i) are successfully obtained and confined in graphene flowers, which could effectively buffer the large volume change of NixSy nanobeads in redox reactions owing to the synergistic effect of these two types of nanocrystals (Fig. S9†).15
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technology was performed to investigate the chemical states of PM-NixSy microflowers. As shown in Fig. 2a, the XPS full spectrum confirms the coexistence of C, N, S and Ni atoms in PM-NixSy microflowers. Furthermore, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ni 2p (Fig. 2c) shows that the two peaks located at about 856.3 eV and about 873.8 eV are assigned to the spin–orbit doublet of the 2p orbital of Ni2+ (Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2) along with two typical Ni 2p “shake up” satellites. With respect to the S 2p spectrum in Fig. 2d, the two strong peaks at about 162.5 and 163.7 eV are attributed to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2. The XPS results are in good agreement with other previous reports, suggesting the successful synthesis of nickel sulfides.11,14

The surface area and pore-size distribution are two key parameters for electrodes in SC applications.42,43 As shown in Fig. 2e, typical IV isotherms with H3-type hysteresis loops in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0.5–1.0 are observed for PM-NixSy, indicating that the PM-NixSy microflowers possess abundant mesopores.44,45 It is demonstrated that the PM-NixSy microflowers possess a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of 50 m2 g−1 and pore volume with a value of 0.156 cm3 g−1. Meanwhile, the pore size distribution (Fig. 2f) clearly reveals the presence of numerous pores ranging from 3 to 10 nm. Moreover, the PM-NixSy shows a trimodal pore size distribution of about 3.8, 4.9 and 7.4 nm, respectively, which are ascribed to the applied drying technique, e.g., the ordinary drying process can induce a more compact solid than that derived from spray drying.31 The slightly large pores, high specific surface area, and abundant pore space in PM-NixSy can relieve the volume change of NixSy that occurred in the OH− ion insertion/desertion processes, resulting in a durable cycling performance during ultra-long cycling. More information about PM-NixSy microflowers is provided in Fig. S10.† Profiting from this optimized architecture, it is expected that the pomegranate-like PM-NixSy microflowers with sturdy structural integrity and abundant mesopores exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, especially satisfactory cycling stability for SCs.

Fig. 3a shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of PM-NixSy microflowers in a three-electrode cell with 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, displaying two peaks, which indicate the pseudocapacitive characteristics of the PM-NixSy. The reaction mechanism is similar to those of previous literature,7,46 associated with the following reversible reaction: NiS + OH− ⇌ NiSOH + e−(5) Ni3S4 + OH− ⇌ Ni3S4OH + e−(6)

The inset in (e) shows the CV curves of the PM-NixSy in the initial state and after 100000 cycles. XRD patterns of (f) PM-NixSy, (g) DM-NixSy@G and (h) NiS@G electrodes in the initial state and after various cycles. 
For PM-NixSy, when increasing the sweep rate from 2 to 20 mV s−1, the corresponding current response increases while the shape of the current curves shows negligible change, indicating the rapid electronic/ionic transport and low polarization resistance.8 This is further confirmed by the EIS plot of PM-NixSy, wherein a low charge-transfer resistance (Rct = 2.3 Ω) and larger than 45° oblique line are observed (Fig. 3b). Calculated from the GCD curves (Fig. 3c), the specific discharge capacities of the PM-NixSy microflowers are 323.8, 277.0, 246.3, 223.9, 203.8 and 163.6 mA h g−1 at current densities of 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 A g−1, respectively, which are higher than those of most previously reported nickel sulfide-based materials (Fig. 3d).36,41,47–49
Moreover, the PM-NixSy microflowers exhibit a durable cycle life at 5 A g−1 with only 1.1% capacitance loss after 100000 cycles (Fig. 3e), while the DM-NixSy@G and NiS@G electrodes suffer from 24.8% and 16.2% capacitance loss during long-term cycling, respectively (Fig. S11 and S12†). More details about the electrochemical performance of DM-NixSy@G and NiS@G electrodes is shown in Fig. S13 and S14.† Notably, the capacitance retention rate as high as 98.9% of the PM-NixSy microflower electrode is much higher than those of DM-NixSy@G, NiS@G and previously reported nickel sulfide-based materials (Table S1†), such as Ni3S4–MoS2 heterojunctions (85.0% retention after 20000 cycles at 10 A g−1),36 hierarchical Ni@rGO-Ni2S3 (90.3% retention after 3000 cycles at 12 A g−1)49 and NiS/Ni3S4 nanosheets (86% retention after 10000 cycles at 3 A g−1).7 Compared with DM-NixSy@G and NiS@G, PM-NixSy microflowers exhibit excellent durable cycling stability attributed to their enhanced structural integrity, which is consistent with their almost identical CV curve after 100000 cycles (inset in Fig. 3e). Furthermore, the XRD patterns of these three electrodes at different stages further demonstrate their uneven structural stability during long-term cycling. In the case of the PM-NixSy electrode, the (113) peak of Ni3S4 initially observed at 31.10° shifts to 31.04°, while the (021) peak of β-NiS initially observed at 35.46° shifts to 35.38° after 100000 cycles, which are nearly the same as their original 2θ positions. In contrast, as for the DM-NixSy@G electrode, the (113) peak of Ni3S4 and (021) peak of β-NiS exhibit an obvious decrease of 0.39° and 0.34° after 100000 cycles, respectively. Similar to the case of DM-NixSy@G, the (021) peak of β-NiS for NiS@G has shifted from 35.75° to 35.34° after 100000 cycles, more specifically about a decrease of 0.41°. Obviously, the PM-NixSy microflowers have maintained a considerably better structural stability during the ultra-long cycling compared with DM-NixSy@G and NiS@G.
In order to provide insights into the electrochemical reaction of PM-NixSy, NiS@G and DM-NixSy@G in 2 M KOH, ex situ XRD analysis coupled with the GCD test has been performed. Before starting the ex situ XRD test, cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 has been conducted for 50 cycles to stabilize the electrochemical signature. The GCD curves of PM-NixSy, DM-NixSy@G and NiS@G at a current density of 5 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 4a, c and e. The XRD diffraction patterns of PM-NixSy, DM-NixSy@G and NiS@G electrodes were recorded at various potentials (A, B, C, D and E) during the GCD cycling (Fig. 4b, d and f). As for the charging section, the XRD patterns recorded in potential regions A to C clearly reveal a shift of the reflections to lower 2θ values, indicating an increase of the lattice parameters due to the expansion of the Ni3S4 and β-NiS host lattice caused by the intercalation of OH− ions within the electrodes.5,50–52 When discharged from 0.48 V back to −0.1 V, a progressive shift of the Ni3S4 (113) and β-NiS (021) peaks to higher 2θ values is observed, which indicates a decrease of the lattice spacings, ascribed to the deintercalation of OH− ions in the Ni3S4 and β-NiS. Regarding PM-NixSy microflowers, the (113) peak of Ni3S4 initially observed at 31.06° at −0.1 V shifts to 30.94° when charged to 0.48 V, while the (021) peak of β-NiS exhibits a decrease of 0.16° from 35.65°. Then, the (113) and (021) peaks shift to 30.98° and 35.60° when discharged to −0.1 V, respectively, virtually the same as their original 2θ positions, demonstrating a relatively reversible transition within the PM-NixSy electrode during the charge–discharge cycling (Fig. 4b).50 By comparison, concerning the DM-NixSy@G electrode, the (113) peak of Ni3S4 initially occurs at 31.22° and shifts to 30.96° when charged to 0.48 V, while the (021) peak of β-NiS shifts from 35.66° to 35.44°. However, even when discharged to −0.1 V, the (113) and (021) peaks cannot reversibly shift back to the original 2θ position, more specifically showing about a decrease of 0.14° and 0.18°, respectively. Analogously, the (021) peak of β-NiS for NiS@G exhibits a large irreversible left shift (0.11°) during the charge and discharge cycling in the same manner as DM-NixSy@G. More exactly, the (021) peak shifts from 35.51° to 35.29° during the charge process and partially shifts back to 35.41° when discharged to −0.1 V. It is concluded that the structural stability of PM-NixSy microflowers has been effectively enhanced during the electrochemical reactions, which contributes to strong cycling durability during ultra-long cycling.

The excellent electrochemical behaviors of bioinspired pomegranate-like PM-NixSy microflowers can be attributed to the following aspects: (1) the nanosized core–shell binary nickel sulfide (Ni3S4/β-NiS) nanobeads are endowed with the synergistic effect of the core–shell Ni3S4 and β-NiS nanocrystals, which can buffer the volume change of nickel sulfides during cycling; (2) the 3D graphene flowers with a porous structure can allow for efficient charge transfer between the electrode and electrolyte to improve the electrochemical performance, which not only provides plenty of active sites and rich access channels beneficial to charge storage, but also functions as an electrical highway to ensure that all NixSy nanobeads are electrochemically active; (3) on one hand, the 3D structure of pomegranate-like PM-NixSy inhibits the restacking of graphene and NixSy nanobeads function as a spacer to further restrain the restacking of graphene sheets; on the other hand, the graphene flowers offer enough and appropriate void spaces to accommodate the volume change of NixSy and prevent the aggregation of NixSy nanobeads during cycling. This pomegranate-like structure interlaced with graphene nanosheets ensures that all NixSy nanobeads are interconnected and linked, thus providing firm structural stability to accommodate the mechanical stresses induced by redox reactions. Moreover, this can be further confirmed by the SEM, TEM and XPS results of PM-NixSy after 100000 cycles (Fig. S15–17†).
On the basis of the excellent electrochemical performance of PM-NixSy, a kind of flexible asymmetric SCs (PM-NixSy//PG) were successfully fabricated by using 3D PM-NixSy microflowers and porous graphene microspheres (PG, more details about the electrochemical performance of PG are shown in Fig. S18†) pressed on graphite paper as positive and negative electrodes, respectively (Fig. 5a). Fig. 5b shows the CV curves of the as-fabricated ASCs at different scan rates with a wide working voltage window of 1.6 V, displaying a relatively regular shape, which suggests the superior electrochemical performance of PM-NixSy//PG. Calculated from the GCD curves (Fig. 5c) of the as-fabricated devices at different current densities from 1 to 30 A g−1, the specific capacity of ASCs is 110.3 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which contributes to achieving a maximum energy density up to 88 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.81 kW kg−1 (Fig. 5d). As shown in Fig. 5d, these PM-NixSy//PG ASCs with such a superior energy storage performance outperform commercial SCs,53 capacitors,54 and most previously reported nickel sulfide-based SCs (Table S1†).3–5,11,16,35,37,38,46,49,55–57 Benefiting from the high-efficiency energy storage capability, two PM-NixSy//PG ASCs connected in series can easily light up the illumination lamps, run the motor fan for a couple of minutes and even make the electronic game machine work normally after being fully charged (Fig. 5e).

(j) Capacitance retention after different solar-charging and discharging processes. The inset in (j) shows the Nyquist plots of the ASCs in the initial state and after various cycles. 
Moreover, the cycle performance of PM-NixSy//PG ASCs at a current density of 5 A g−1 for 100000 cycles is shown in Fig. 5f, displaying little degradation of specific capacitance during the long-term cycling. Notably, 97.6% of the initial specific capacitance of the as-assembled ASCs has been retained from 0 to 1.6 V after 100000 cycles. It is critical to note that PM-NixSy//PG ASCs exhibit superior cycling stability than the vast majority of previously reported nickel sulfide-based ASCs in KOH electrolyte, including Ni3S4–MoS2//AC (86.2% retention after 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1),36 rod-like NiS2//rGO (84.1% retention after 4000 cycles at 2 A g−1)35 and hollow NiS2/ZnS nanospheres//AC (88.7% retention after 1500 cycles at 5 A g−1)37 (Table S2†). Moreover, the PM-NixSy//PG ASCs display nearly identical CV curves in the initial state, after 20000 or 50000 cycles and even after 100000 charge–discharge processes at 50 mV s−1 (inset in Fig. 5f). This is due to the favorable ionic diffusion kinetics and charge transport as well as the robust structural integrity of PM-NixSy during the repeated charge–discharge processes. Undoubtedly, the as-fabricated ASCs not only achieve high energy density, but also present unprecedented durable cycling stability, showing their appealing potential for high performance energy storage devices. More details about the electrochemical performance of the PM-NixSy//PG ASCs are shown in Fig. S19 and S20.†
Based on this, the PM-NixSy//PG ASCs have been applied to store solar energy, which is considered as an important sustainable and renewable energy source due to its abundance, ubiquity and permanence (Fig. 5g).58–60 In order to appraise the charging and discharging behaviors of ASCs by harvesting solar energy, a set of specific experiments has been performed using natural sunlight (Fig. 5h). In this system, one commercial miniature solar cell panel (SCP) and two PM-NixSy//PG ASCs connected in series are assembled to convert solar energy into electricity and store the harvested energy, respectively. Initially, the output electric signals generated from the SCP were stabilized at 3 V through the electronic regulator to charge the ASCs equably. Finally, the ASCs were fully charged after solar energy supply for 5 minutes. It is gratifying that the extraordinary capability of the ASCs was demonstrated by lighting up a red lamp for 5 minutes as well as making a miniature game machine work properly (Fig. 5i). More information about the used equipment is provided in Table S3.† Meanwhile, the whole charge/discharge process is available as a video in ESI Movies 2 and 3.† This achievement fully demonstrates the effective way of charging ASCs by harvesting solar energy and reveals the high energy density of PM-NixSy//PG ASCs after charging. Moreover, there occurs only a slight decrease of the capacitance (3.7%) and nearly identical ESR characteristics even after 20000 charge–discharge processes (Fig. 5j and inset in Fig. 5j), proving the excellent stability, high electrochemical reversibility and beneficial electrochemical kinetic behaviors of the assembled ASCs. According to the EIS plots, the beneficial electrochemical kinetic behavior is further indicated by a low charge-transfer resistance (Rct = 2.3 Ω) in the high frequency range and larger than 45° oblique line (inset in Fig. 5j). It is confirmed that the PM-NixSy//PG ASCs have a fast charge/discharge behavior, which is also supported by the inconspicuous “IR” drop in the GCD curves (Fig. 5c). Consequently, the electricity generated from solar energy can hardly be wasted due to ohmic losses of ASCs, accordingly ensuring the high utilization rate of solar energy during the repeated charge–discharge processes. These results sufficiently demonstrate the viability of sustainable energy system applications by integrating high-performance ASCs with a commercial SPC. Therefore, this work paves an innovative and promising way to develop sustainable energy systems combining energy harvesting and storage.
Conclusions
In conclusion, bioinspired pomegranate-like PM-NixSy microflowers confining core–shell binary NixSy nanobeads have been successfully prepared via an easy scale-up spray drying combined with the pyrolysis and in situ nanospace-confined sulfidation strategy. The 3D PM-NixSy microflowers deliver a high specific capacity of 323.8 mA h g−1 and exhibit durable cycling stability during ultra-long cycling (98.9% retention after 100000 cycles at 5 A g−1). Benefiting from the remarkable performance of PM-NixSy, the assembled PM-NixSy//PG ASCs achieve an attractive energy density up to 88 W h kg−1 at a power density of 810 W kg−1, outperforming most previously reported nickel sulfide-based SCs. It is particularly worth mentioning that the as-fabricated devices display an unprecedented durable cycling life (a capacitance retention of 97.6% after 100000 cycles at 5 A g−1), which has hardly been reported for previous nickel sulfide-based SCs. This is not only attributed to the synergistic effect of core–shell binary NixSy nanobeads which can buffer the volume change of nickel sulfides during cycling, but also attributed to the fact that 3D graphene acts as a structural framework to ensure the obviously enhanced structural integrity. On this basis, the ASCs can be effectually recharged by harvesting sustainable solar energy and repeatedly supply power to various electronics, such as lighting up a red lamp and making a miniature game machine work properly, without a decline of electrochemical performance. Therefore, this encouraging novel electrode can open up the possibility of nickel sulfide-based materials for numerous applications in SCs with unprecedented durability during ultra-long cycling for developing sustainable energy harvesting and storage systems.
