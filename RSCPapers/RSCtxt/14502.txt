    , Accepted 6th July 2017First published on 10th July 2017AbstractA newly synthesized small molecule donor, BDTT-2DPPBFu, is designed for incorporation into the photo-active layer in solution-processed small molecule organic photovoltaics (SM-OPVs). The effects of a solvent additive (1-chloronaphthalene, CN) on the bulk heterojunction morphology of a BDTT-2DPPBFu donor:fullerene derivative acceptor (PC71BM) are investigated and correlated with the device performance. A TEM analysis revealed that the nanomorphology of the SM-OPVs evolved dramatically with increasing solvent additive volume. With an optimum concentration of 2.5 vol% CN, a nanomorphology with a fibrillar and interpenetrating network on the order of exciton diffusion length (∼10–15 nm) is formed, resulting in improvement of the short-circuit current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency. Further GIWAXS studies have shown that the π–π stacking distance of BDTT-2DPPBFu small molecules is reduced and the inter-mixing of PC71BM within the BDTT-2DPPBFu-rich phase in the photo-active layer processed from 2.5 vol% CN is increased, leading to enhanced charge transport and reduced charge recombination and transfer resistance. The present work provides important progress in the nanomorphology of the photo-active layer, which can be effectively tuned via the use of a solvent additive in SM-OPVs.
Introduction
The efficiencies of BHJ SM-OPVs can be improved by various approaches including the following: (1) synthesizing novel photo-active materials,1–4 (2) device architectural engineering5–7 and (3) optimizing the morphology of the photo-active layer.8–10 Among these strategies for highly efficient BHJ SM-OPVs, tuning and controlling the nanomorphology of the photo-active layer present a challenge from the point of view of miscibility between the electron donor and acceptor materials as well as film-forming properties. A. J. Heeger noted six methods that have been proved to be effective to modify the nanomorphology in BHJ SM-OPVs: (a) using a suitable solvent; (b) varying the D:A blend ratio; (c) using solvent additives; (d) varying the concentration; (e) application of thermal and/or solvent annealing; and (f) modifying the molecular structure of the materials.10 Among these methods, employing a solvent additive to form an optimum nanomorphology of the SM-based photo-active layer has rarely been investigated.
In this paper, a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based SM was designed and synthesized for incorporation into the photo-active layer of solution-processed BHJ SM-OPVs. DPP based materials have demonstrated remarkable potential as donor materials due to their desirable properties such as broad optical absorption, chemical and thermal stability, high hole mobilities and ease of synthesis and modification.1,11–17 In particular, DPP based electron donor moieties offer a great deal of potential in terms of its bandgap tuning.18,19 E. Zhou et al. pointed out that the absorption range of dithieno-DPP (DTDPP) can be tuned by changing the donor segments and reported absorption up to 1000 nm.20 After realizing absorption in the range of μm, further improvement was carried out by the same group when a linear alkyl chain, instead of a branched chain, was attached to the DTDPP and absorption was as high as 1.1 μm.21 Recently, Tang A. et al. summarized the results of SM-based OPVs containing DPP acceptor units, with all the combinations of donor units as well as the end group on the backbone of the SMs.22 Solution-processed BHJ OPVs based on DPP-containing SMs have provided high PCEs of over 5%.3,18,28–30 However, there is substantial room for further increasing the device performance of DPP-based BHJ SM OPVs. We have synthesized a SM comprising the backbone of a relatively electron rich alkylthienylbenzodithiophene (BDTT) unit, connected to an electron deficient DPP moiety, giving an A–D–A type SM structure (detailed synthesis procedures and NMR data can be found in the ESI†). Recently, our group has reported this type of A–D–A SMs having bithiophene at the terminal position and showing a PCE of 5.12%.3 Our previous work was aimed at understanding the BHJ nanomorphology in SM:PC71BM with and without the alkyl-chain attaching to the terminal thiophene moiety. Here, we synthesized a new SM by replacing the terminal bithiophene with benzofuran BDTT-2DPPBFu, as shown in Fig. 1a. Hence, we further delineate the causative relationship between nanomorphology, charge transport properties, and device performance as a function of the solvent additive volume. We have studied the evolution of the nanomorphology of BDTT-2DPPBFu:PC71BM as a photo-active layer using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).

Results and discussion
Optical and electrochemical properties
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy of the solution and film states of the BDTT-2DPPBFu small molecule and the [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) film is shown in Fig. 1b. It can be observed that the film state of BDTT-2DPPBFu shows a broader bathochromic shift of the peak compared to the solution state. Red shift of the peak and an additional vibronic shoulder peak appear at 725 nm due to the planarity of BDTT-2DPPBFu, stronger molecular packing and π–π interaction between molecules in the film state, indicating strong aggregation behaviour.1,31–34,36 The strong electron deficient nature of the DPP moiety helps in achieving low band gap SMs. The absorption edge of the film at 800 nm gives an optical band gap of 1.55 eV. The electrochemical properties of BDTT-2DPPBFu were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). As shown in Fig. S1a (ESI†), it can be seen that the onset of the oxidation potential (Eoxonset) is 0.50 V. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were estimated to be −5.20 eV by using the equation: EHOMO = [(Eoxonset − E1/2(ferrocene)) + 4.8] eV, which is attributed to the half-wave potential of the reference ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple.31,35,50 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of BDTT-2DPPBFu was calculated from the HOMO level and its optical band gap (Eoptg) in the film state was calculated to be at −3.65 eV. Detailed optical and electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were employed to investigate the thermal properties of BDTT-2DPPBFu. The TGA showed 5% weight loss of BDTT-2DPPBFu at 393 °C (Fig. S1b, ESI†), while the DSC scan did not show any thermal transition peaks in the temperature scan up to 300 °C (Fig. S1c, ESI†), suggesting that BDTT-2DPPBFu has good thermal stability.36,37 The frontier molecular orbitals and geometry of the BDTT-2DPPBFu were determined via density functional theory (DFT) using DMol3 software (Fig. S2a–d, ESI†). In the DMol electronic structure calculations, the all-electron treatment and double numerical polarized (DNP) basis sets were chosen. The density function was treated with the B3LYP hybrid functional. Since the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were also measured experimentally from CV and Eoptg in the film state, DFT does not include the packing factor of BDTT-2DPPBFu and also the calculations are based on a single entity.38 Therefore, these experimental values and the DFT calculations of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are usually slightly different. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels from DFT calculations were found to be −5.06 eV and −3.02 eV, respectively. Finally, the dihedral angle (A1-6) in an optimized geometry of the BDTT-2DPPBFu small molecule is shown in Fig. S2e (ESI†).

Photovoltaic properties
The device structure used in this study is a conventional device, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BDTT-2DPPBFu:PC71BM/Ca/Al and the detailed procedure for device fabrication can be found in the ESI.† The effect of different BDTT-2DPPBFu:PC71BM weight ratios prepared from chloroform (CF) was first investigated. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. S3 and photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).
With an optimized weight ratio of 1.0:1.0 for BDTT-2DPPBFu:PC71BM, a PCE of 1.57% was obtained, with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.77 V, a short circuit current density (JSC) of 3.82 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 53%. PCEs of BHJ OPVs can be enhanced using different methods, including the following: (1) thermal annealing,3,15,27 (2) solvent vapour annealing,9,12,18,26 and (3) the use of a solvent additive.7,30,38–42 First, we checked the effect of thermal annealing on the photovoltaic performance with an optimized weight ratio of 1.0:1.0 for BDTT-2DPPBFu:PC71BM processed from CF without any solvent additive. PCEs improved with an increase in thermal annealing temperature up to 130 °C, whereas further increment of temperature to 150 °C negatively affected photovoltaic parameters, especially JSC (Fig. S4 and Table S2, ESI†). On the basis of the optimized 1.0:1.0 weight ratio, various amounts (by vol%) of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) from 0.3 vol% to 4.5 vol% were added to the photo-active blend solutions to examine the effect of the solvent additive on the photovoltaic parameters.

J–V curves, their respective external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) and the variation of photovoltaic parameters as a function of CN volume are shown in Fig. 2. In addition, photovoltaic performance values are summarized in Table 2. Because, the solvent additive helps in improving the morphology of the photo-active film,39–42 the photovoltaic parameters improved as the additive content of CN was increased up to 2.5 vol%. The reason for the PCE enhancement will be explained in the next section with respect to the nanomorphology in the photo-active layer. The best device showing a PCE value of 5.83% with VOC = 0.69 V, JSC = 13.46 mA cm−2 and FF = 63% is obtained by using 2.5 vol% CN. The short-circuit current density (JSC) as calculated using a solar simulator was confirmed by measuring their EQEs, and the results were consistent with our solar simulator derived JSC. Average performance values from over 10 independent optimized devices are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and summarized in Table 2. When the CN amount was further increased beyond the optimum 2.5 vol% to 4.5 vol% CN, deterioration in the device performance due to non-optimized morphology of the photo-active layer was observed. A higher amount of additive severely reduced the JSC, and FF and then degraded the overall performance of the SM-OPVs, which will also be explained in detail in the next sections. As, we have studied the morphology of the blend films by varying the CN solvent additive content, neither thermal annealing nor solvent vapour annealing has been employed.

Morphology evolution
To identify the reason for the improvement in the PCE, the morphology of photo-active films was characterized using different methods. First, bright-field TEM was employed to determine the type of morphology that has been formed inside the photo-active layer. When the incident electron beam is made to fall onto the sample, it scattered the electron beam giving us dark and bright regions.43 We designate dark regions as PC71BM while bright regions are assigned to BDTT-2DPPBFu in TEM images because PC71BM is a richer electron material than BDTT-2DPPBFu small molecules.
It can be clearly seen from Fig. 3a that without the solvent additive, large aggregates of PC71BM ranging in size from 50 nm to over 150 nm are formed. These large spherical PC71BM aggregates hinder the intercalation of PC71BM and BDTT-2DPPBFu. The absence of percolation pathways for charge carrier flow limited the JSC and FF. With the addition of even a small amount of CN (1.0 vol%), these aggregates completely disappear and a new nanomorphology with an interpenetrating network of donor and acceptor materials is formed (Fig. 3b). Although a finer network is formed with 1.0 vol% CN, further improvement of the nanomorphology could be achieved by increasing the amount of CN up to 2.5 vol% (Fig. 3c). This fibrillar and interpenetrating network on the order of exciton diffusion length (∼10–15 nm)35 is proved to be beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transportation through the photo-active layer.5,35 Upon further increasing the additive content, fibrillar domains of larger size appear with 3.5 vol% CN, which resulted in a gradual drop in PCE caused by the reduction in the JSC and FF. As reported previously, when the solvent additive content is increased far beyond the optimized volume, larger domains are formed, which results in poor exciton dissociation, thereby, limiting the charge generation in the devices.41 In our devices, 4.5 vol% of CN resulted in severe BDTT-2DPPBFu aggregation and a new large scale phase separation occurred and affected all the photovoltaic parameters.

Charge transport and recombination studies
A fibrillar and interpenetrating network is helpful in terms of better exciton dissociation and charge transport leading to improved PCEs in OPVs.9,16 To study the impact of the fibrillar and interpenetrating network on charge carrier mobilities, we measured the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) using space charge limited current (SCLC) methods.48,49 The values of hole and electron mobilities are summarized in Table 3 and dark J0.5versus V plots are shown in Fig. 4a and b.

As large phase segregated domains are the major reason for PCE limitation in solar cells,9,43–45 the SM-OPV without CN additive showed relatively low μh and μe mobilities (6.08 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.16 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively) in hole- and electron-only devices. When 2.5 vol% CN was added to the solution, both μh and μe were greatly improved to 21.59 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 17.28 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. With 2.5 vol% CN, a fibrillar and interpenetrating network of donor and acceptor materials is formed, creating bi-continuous charge pathways (Fig. 3c), and this helps in effective charge transport through the photo-active layers. Balanced μh and μe lead to improved charge carrier transport through the device by minimizing the accumulation and recombination of charge carriers, and positively impacts the FF. In our SM-OPVs, the ratios of μh/μe for 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 vol% CN are 2.16, 1.24 and 2.27, respectively and the FF values varied accordingly as can be seen from Table 2.
The incident light intensity (Pin) and JSC are directly related via the relation JSC ∝ Pαin, where the exponential factor provides information regarding bimolecular recombination.46,47 The JSC and VOC were measured as a function of light intensity Pin and as we anticipated, a 2.5 vol% CN based device showed a relatively higher α value as compared to the case without CN (0.95 vs. 0.92) implying that the charges can flow relatively well through the solar cell without prior bimolecular recombination (Fig. 4c). Monomolecular (or trap-assisted) and bimolecular recombination can also be assessed from the slope of the plot of VOC as a function of Pin, where a lower slope (near to 1) shows dominance of bimolecular recombination and a higher slope near 2 shows additional trap-assisted recombination.46 The 2.5 vol% CN based SM-OPV showed a lower slope of 1.45kBT/q as compared to the device without a solvent additive, where the slope was found to be 1.83kBT/q (Fig. 4d). This indicates that the bimolecular recombination mechanism is dominant in our best device whereas, without the additive, additional trap-assisted recombination affected the device performance. Large spherical PC71BM domains in the latter case act as centers for trap-assisted recombinations.
These results were further corroborated by series resistances (RS) and shunt resistances (RSH) of the SM-OPVs measured from dark J–V curves (Fig. 4e) and relevant values are summarized in Table 3. Ideally, RS should be as low as possible approaching zero, while RSH must approach infinity to obtain the maximum JSC and FF from the device. Here, in our best performing device, the 2.5 vol% CN based devices showed the lowest RS and the highest RSH among the tested devices. These results are further substantiated by measurement of impedance spectroscopy (IS). IS measurement has recently been employed in solar cells to extract a range of information including resistance to charge transport.51–53Fig. 4f shows the fitted Nyquist plots of the SM-OPVs processed from various volumes of the CN additive under open-circuit and 1 Sun illuminated conditions. The size of the dominant large single-arc based semi-circles changes with the evolution of the nanomorphology of the photo-active layer (Fig. 3). The smallest semi-circle with a single arc was obtained with the 2.5 vol% CN additive where the fibrillar and interpenetrating network was formed. Furthermore, this sample device showed the lowest charge transfer resistance (R2) as calculated from the equivalent circuit model (Fig. 4f). All values of R2 in this study are summarized in Table 3. Without the additive, large phase segregated domains (Fig. 3a) are formed, imparting a very high R2 as measured from IS which indicates higher resistance to the flow of charge carriers though the device. As the increase of the CN content (beyond the optimal 2.5 vol%) in the solution leads to the evolution of a completely new morphology (Fig. 3e), and the fibrillar network mostly disappeared, R2 increased drastically as can be seen from Nyquist spectra, affecting mobilities and limiting the JSC and the FF.
Molecular ordering and orientation
GIWAXS analysis helps us to understand the molecular ordering and orientation in the photo-active layer along the in-plane (xy-plane) and out-of plane (z-plane) direction with respect to the incident beam.24,54–56 In addition, π–π stacking and lamellae distances between the SMs and the degree of crystallinity can be well understood with GIWAXS measurement.25,57

Fig. 5 shows representative 2D-GIWAXS images and the line cut profiles of neat BDTT-2DPPBFu and BDTT-2DPPBFu:PC71BM with 0.0, 1.0, 2.5 and 4.5 CN vol% added to the photo-active material solution and Table S3 (ESI†) summarizes the packing parameters. It is noted that neat BDTT-2DPPBFu showed the absence of the (010) diffraction peak along the out-of-plane (OOP) direction (Fig. 5a), whereas along the in-plane (IP) direction a (010) diffraction peak appeared at around 1.67 Å−1 corresponding to the π–π stacking distance of 3.76 Å. Meanwhile, the neat BDTT-2DPPBFu film exhibits (100) diffractions in both OOP and IP directions at 0.42 Å−1 and 0.37 Å−1. This clearly indicates that the neat BDTT-2DPPBFu SM mainly remains in the edge-on conformation (Fig. 5a, g and Table S3, ESI†). After the addition of PC71BM into the neat BDTT-2DPPBFu, there is also no observable (010) diffraction peak in photo-active layers along the OOP direction (Fig. 5b–f). Meanwhile the photo-active layer casted from 2.5 vol% CN maintained the (010) peak in the IP direction, as can be seen from Fig. 5d and g. The reduced π–π stacking distance is helpful in efficient carrier's transport,23,24 and the addition of 2.5 vol% CN leads to the reduction in the π–π stacking distance from 3.76 Å to 3.66 Å (neat BDTT-2DPPBFu) which is an indication of highly ordered structures. On the other hand, the photo-active film casted from 2.5 CN vol% shows the lowest (100) diffraction peak along both the IP and OOP directions in these films. The larger lamellae distance of BDTT-2DPPBFu in the case of the BHJ photo-active film employing 2.5 CN vol% indicates increased inter-mixing of PC71BM within the BDTT-2DPPBFu-rich phase. This increased dispersion of PC71BM and BDTT-2DPPBFu in a mixed domain would self-assemble into an interpenetrating network and facilitate exciton quenching and charge transport. The above results suggest that the solvent additive influenced molecular packing and orientation between BDTT-2DPPBFu small molecules in photo-active layers. As the main CF solvent evaporates, the high-BP CN solvent additive provides enough time for molecular organization to occur within the BDTT-2DPPBFu:PC71BM photo-active layers, while the PC71BMs are well dispersed with the aid of their high solubility in CN. The optimum CN volume appears to be related to BP and selective solubility between BDTT-2DPPBFu and PC71BM. As the charge carrier transport in OPVs takes place via a hopping process,58,59 the reduced π–π stacking distance and increased inter-mixing of PC71BM within the BDTT-2DPPBFu-rich phase in the photo-active layer employing 2.5 vol% CN contribute to enhanced charge transport and reduced charge recombination in the photo-active layers. This optimum CN solvent additive helped in the formation of an improved fibrillar and interpenetrating network, and this morphology is regarded as nanomorphology, as witnessed in TEM images (Fig. 3). For efficient flow of charge carriers through the device, the fibrillar and interpenetrating network is beneficial as it improves the JSC and the FF, in solution-processed SM-OPVs. Interestingly, the photo-active layer processed from 4.5 vol% CN shows severe molecular aggregation of BDTT-2DPPBFu, consistent with the results of the morphological study. This might be a result of the weaker aggregation of PC71BM in a more aggregated BDTT-2DPPBFu SM rich phase, yielding reduced electron mobility and increased charge recombination.

Vertical phase separation
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to find out CN additive content after the spin coating of the active layer, and to investigate the vertical phase separation between photoactive materials in the SM-OPV. The most widely used solvent additive in OPVs is 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), and it evaporates slowly because of high BP and a very low vapour pressure (3.1 × 10−4 mbar). In contrast to DIO, 1-CN has a relatively high vapour pressure (3.8 × 10−2 mbar), and therefore it will evaporate relatively quickly and leave compact photo-active materials in less time in comparison to DIO. To confirm this phenomenon and investigate the vertical phase separation, we carried out an XPS analysis of the CF as well as CF + 2.5 vol% CN processed devices as a function of etching time. The C1s peak was assigned to PC71BM, the S2p peak to sulphur in the donor BDTT-2DPPBFu, and the Cl2p peak to the CN additive. The surface of the photo-active layer was etched progressively throughout the bulk with different etching times to 1100 s. Intriguingly, there was neither any pronounced vertical phase separation nor residue CN content throughout the bulk photo-active films (Fig. S6, ESI†).
Conclusions
In conclusion, we thoroughly investigated the morphological evolution of a photo-active layer based on SM-OPVs. The nanomorphology of the newly synthesized BDTT-DPP small molecule end-capped with benzofuran was optimized with a CN solvent additive helped in obtaining the PCE of up to 5.83% which is among the best efficiencies with a DPP-BDTT-DPP backbone core of the donor material. Careful tuning of the solvent additive led to a remarkable difference in the morphology, i.e. a fibrillar and interpenetrating network, which was less pronounced in other photo-active films. A highly crystalline interpenetrating fibrillar network on the order of exciton diffusion length not only helped in effectively transporting charge carriers, but also reduced trap-assisted and bimolecular recombinations, leading to enhanced hole and electron mobilities. Additionally, no vertical phase separation or residue CN additive in the bulk photo-active layer was observed. Little attention has been given to this kind of morphological study of SM-OPVs with the help of a solvent additive to date and the present study will help us further understand and tune the morphology of SM based OPVs.
