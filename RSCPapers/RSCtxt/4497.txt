    , Accepted 2nd August 2018First published on 3rd August 2018AbstractIn this paper, we employ a vacuum assisted solution process (VASP) for fabricating high efficiency Sb2S3 solar cells. Our study uncovers that the VASP approach is able to fabricate Sb2S3 absorber materials with high crystallinity and phase purity, both contribute to enhanced device performance. By constructing solar cells using TiO2 nanorod arrays as the electron extraction material, the device efficiency is increased from 4.15% to 6.78%, which is among the top efficiencies in all kinds of Sb2S3, Sb2(S,Se)3 and Sb2Se3 solar cells.
To discover solar cell materials with low-cost, high efficiency, and long term stability is one of the significant tasks in the development of solar cells. Recently, a series of unconventional semiconducting materials, such as GeSe,1 Sb2(S, Se)3,2 AgBiS2,3 SbSI4 and CH3NH3SbSI2,5 have been examined as light harvesting materials. Investigations on photovoltaic materials would bring forth new opportunities for next generation solar cells. Among these materials, antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) is an excellent candidate for light absorbing material in solar cells.6–8 This material possesses non-toxic and earth-abundant compositional elements, and good stability against moisture and air, making them promising for large scale applications.9–11 Sb2S3 has a suitable band gap of ∼1.7 eV with a peak absorption coefficient of 1.8 × 105 cm−1 in the visible range. This energy gap allows its use as either the sole absorber material in single junction solar cells or a wide band gap light harvester in tandem solar cells.12,13
For solar device fabrication, Sb2S3 was initially applied as a light harvester to substitute for organic dye molecules in sensitized solar cells by chemical bath deposition (CBD).14 CBD as a convenient and low cost fabrication method has been frequently applied in the fabrication of Sb2S3 solar cells.15–17 Further investigations on the interaction between CBD-derived Sb2S3 and organic hole transporting materials, surface defect passivation and interfacial engineering have led to top power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in the range from 5% to 7.5%.8,18,19 In addition, thermal evaporation and thermal decomposition of organometallics which contain Sb and S elements have also been developed for the fabrication of Sb2S3 for device optimizations.18,20–22
As for scalable device fabrication, solution processing has attracted more and more interest since it is compatible with large area printing techniques. High efficiency solution processed films should simultaneously have high crystallinity, high purity and good film formability. In the solution processing of metal chalcogenide photovoltaic materials, organic solvents are usually applied to dissolve the metal compound precursors, followed by annealing at high temperature for the formation of high crystallinity films.23–25 In order to avoid oxidation of the as-synthesized metal chalcogenides, this process has to be conducted in inert gas atmospheres such as nitrogen and argon. The formation of solid semiconducting films is accompanied by the evaporation of decomposed organic molecules. During this process, dynamic control over the solvent evaporation would benefit both the crystallization and phase purity of the as-obtained final products. Here we demonstrate that pre-treatment in a vacuum at specific temperature allows the enhancement of pore filling of Sb2S3 into TiO2 nanorod arrays, crystallinity and phase purity. As a result, the Sb2S3 film prepared by conventional process (CP) at ambient pressure delivers a device efficiency of 4.01%, while the VASP-Sb2S3 film shows a remarkable enhancement to 6.78%.
In this study, TiO2 nanorod arrays were utilized as electron extraction materials and were synthesized by a hydrothermal process according to a reported method with minor modifications (Fig. 1a).26,27 Experimental details are provided in the Experimental section. For the synthesis of Sb2S3, antimony(III) chloride (SbCl3) and thiourea (TU) are utilized as source materials, which are dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME). 2-ME was previously applied to dissolve copper, zinc and tin salt with TU for the fabrication of Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film solar cells.28 Herein, SbCl3 and TU could also be dissolved in 2-ME, forming a transparent Sb–TU complex solution that is stable for several weeks (Fig. 1b). The solution precursors were spin coated onto the TiO2 nanorod arrays in order to fabricate a Sb2S3 sensitized device architecture. Thermal decomposition for the generation of Sb2S3 films was conducted by a two-step annealing process. This pre-treatment was conducted separately under vacuum (VASP) (Fig. 1c) or ambient pressure of a conventional process (CP). The optimized pre-annealing temperatures are 125 and 150 °C for the VASP and CP approaches, respectively. Finally, the film was annealed at 270 °C under a N2 atmosphere to improve the crystallinity (Fig. 1d).

To investigate the compositions of the as-fabricated films associated with different pre-annealing by VASP and CP methods, we conducted X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The high-resolution core-level XPS spectra of Sb 3d3/2 with regard to pre-annealing under vacuum conditions and a conventional process are displayed in Fig. 2a and 2b, respectively. The binding energy of 538.51 eV is ascribed to the Sb3+ oxidation states of Sb2S3 (Fig. 2a). In addition, a binding energy of 539.52 eV corresponding to Sb2O3 phases is also identified in the two samples, albeit very weak.19 By calculating the respective peak areas, the ratios of Sb2O3 in the VASP derived Sb2S3 (denoted as VASP-Sb2S3) and CP-derived Sb2S3 (denoted as CP-Sb2S3) are estimated to be 7.4% and 16%. Although some of the oxygen (oxide) may come from air contamination during sample handling, the parallel comparison is reasonable and indicates that the VASP-Sb2S3 contains less impurity Sb2O3. Additionally, a weak peak located at 164.3 eV is observed in the CP-Sb2S3 film (Fig. 2b), which is assigned to polyatomic elemental sulfur.19 The existence of elemental sulfur may block charge transfer in the solar devices. By contrast, elemental sulfur does not exist in the VASP-Sb2S3 film.

The inset in (d) shows the Tauc plot for band gap calculation of CP-Sb2S3 and VASP-Sb2S3 thin films. 
The crystallinity of the as-synthesized Sb2S3 films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). For VASP-Sb2S3 (Fig. 2c), diffraction peaks at 15.64°, 17.52°, 24.88°, 33.56°, and 35.62° can be clearly identified and indexed to the (0 2 0), (1 2 0), (1 3 0), (3 0 1) and (2 4 0) crystal planes of the typical orthorhombic phase of stibnite, Sb2S3 (JCPDS card no. 42-1393),15,20,29 no impurity peaks are detected. However, the CP-derived sample did not show recognizable diffractions, suggesting a poor crystallinity of Sb2S3. In this case, we proposed that pre-annealing in a vacuum is able to effectively evaporate out the organic molecules so that the barrier for crystal growth is alleviated. However, pre-annealing at ambient pressure is incapable of effectively dissociating organic molecules, which impedes mass diffusion for crystal growth.
Vacuum assisted thermal annealing has been manifested to enhance the uniformity of organic/inorganic hybrid perovskite films as well as the device performance.30–32 Here we conduct surface characterization of the as-prepared Sb2S3 films with TiO2 nanorod arrays by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to study how the vacuum annealing influences the morphology. The CP-Sb2S3 film with pre-annealing at 125 °C has loosely packed large crystals (Fig. 3a). When the pre-annealing temperature increases to 150 °C, although the surface coverage is slightly improved, it still displays patched areas without Sb2S3 coverage (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the VASP-Sb2S3 derived sample with pre-annealing at 125 °C shows essentially improved uniformity (Fig. 3d). In the current investigation, the difference in the two procedures is preannealing, and we postulate that the VASP approach would efficiently extract the solvent from the precursor solution. The efficient extraction of solvent molecules would increase the viscosity of the solvent abruptly, so that uncontrollable flow of precursor solution is suppressed for the formation of a uniform film. Furthermore, if we conduct the pre-annealing at 150 °C in the VASP approach, the Sb2S3 film exhibits a similar morphology to that of CP-Sb2S3 (Fig. 3e). This result indicates that, even under vacuum, a higher annealing temperature would still bring forth uncontrollable flow of precursor solution. Therefore, a suitable annealing temperature with the assistance of a vacuum pump is critical to obtain high quality Sb2S3 films. Coupled with the device investigation, we identified that the optimum condition for the fabrication of Sb2S3 films in TiO2 nanorod arrays is pre-annealing at 150 °C and 125 °C for the CP and VASP methods, followed by annealing at 270 °C in a N2 atmosphere. Actually, we have conducted extensive optimizations of film fabrication with pre-annealing at ambient pressure (Fig. S1 and S2†), the final morphology and device performance can never be improved to a level comparable to that with pre-annealing under the assistance of a vacuum pump.

The light absorption properties of the as-synthesized Sb2S3 films under optimized conditions were characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. It is observed that CP-Sb2S3 and VASP-Sb2S3 exhibit an absorption onset at 735 nm and 765 nm (Fig. 2d), respectively. VASP-Sb2S3 possesses much stronger absorbance in the 500 to 800 nm range than that of the CP reference. This may also be caused by pre-treatment in a vacuum that increases the pore filling of Sb2S3 within the TiO2 nanorod array. The appearance of the VASP-Sb2S3 film (inset in Fig. 3d) is also much darker than that of the CP-Sb2S3 film (inset in Fig. 3b). In this case, the light harvesting capability is increased. The corresponding optical band gaps calculated by the Tauc plot are 1.69 and 1.62 eV for VASP-Sb2S3 and CP-Sb2S3 (inset of Fig. 2d),29 which are close to the typical value of ∼1.70 eV in the literature.15,19,33
Complete solar cells based on the above VASP-Sb2S3 and CP-Sb2S3 were constructed by spin coating of a layer of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the hole transporting material (HTM), followed by thermal evaporation of a gold layer as the metal electrode. The device structure is depicted in Fig. 1e. For the device fabrication, the length of TiO2 nanorods is varied from 90 to 210 nm for performance optimization (Fig. S3†). It turns out that TiO2 nanorods with an average length of 140 nm and a Sb2S3 overlayer of 30 nm generates the highest performance (Fig. S4† and Table S1†). Typical cross sectional SEM images of the VASP and CP film based devices are displayed in Fig. 3c and f, showing comparable thickness of each layer in the two kinds of devices (170 nm vs. 155 nm).
Current density–voltage (J–V) responses of the devices were measured under one Sun illumination (AM 1.5G) (Fig. 4a), the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. The device based on the CP-Sb2S3 film delivers a PCE of 4.01% when preannealed at a temperature of 150 °C for 1.5 min with a VOC of 0.657 V, JSC of 11.84 mA cm−2 and FF of 51.5%. Further extending the evaporation time does not increase the crystallinity of Sb2S3 (Fig. S1c†). Instead, the PCE of the device is decreased to 2.55% and 1.76% when the preannealing time extends to 5 and 10 min (Fig. S1d†). Additionally, the pretreatment at either higher or lower temperature leads to very poor device performance. For example, the device exhibits a decreased PCE of 1.03% when preannealed at a temperature of 125 °C under the ambient pressure of air, which is attributed to the poor surface morphology (Fig. 3a). We independently fabricated 30 devices based on the VASP-Sb2S3 film with pre-annealing at 125 °C, and an average PCE of 6.20% is obtained (Fig. 4b). Conspicuously, the highest PCE of the device reaches 6.78%, with a VOC of 0.671 V, JSC of 18.43 mA cm−2 and FF of 54.8% (Fig. 4a, and Table 1). This efficiency is among the top values in all kinds of Sb2(S, Se)3,2,34,35 Sb2S38,19 and Sb2Se336,37 solar cells. On further increasing the preannealing temperature to 150 °C, the PCE of the VASP-Sb2S3 based device is significantly decreased to 3.17%, with VOC = 0.636 V, JSC = 10.27 mA cm−2, FF = 48.5% (Fig. S2b†). The decreased coverage of Sb2S3 should be the major reason inducing the poor device performance (Fig. 3e). Post-annealing under vacuum also leads to poorer device performance with VOC = 0.628 V, JSC = 9.81 mA cm−2, FF = 51.3% and PCE = 3.17% (Fig. S5†).

A detailed inspection shows that both the JSC and FF are considerably enhanced by the VASP approach (Table 1). To probe the reason behind this enhancement, we extract the series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) of the devices. The device based on the VASP-Sb2S3 film exhibits a RSH of 368.8 Ω cm2, while that based on the CP-Sb2S3 film possesses a RSH of 310.8 Ω cm2. RSH is associated with the recombination probability of the device. In this perspective, higher recombination probability in CP-Sb2S3 is generated when compared with that of VASP-Sb2S3. The low surface coverage of Sb2S3 on the TiO2 nanorod array would lead to direct contact between the HTM and TiO2 compact layer and in turn increase the recombination probability that ultimately reduces the FF. For the film prepared under high vacuum, a more uniform morphology facilitates the formation of a beneficial interface between the HTM and Sb2S3, thus impeding carrier recombination for high FF. The dark current measurement also shows that the leakage current of the solar cell can be reduced by the VASP method, which reduces the recombination of carriers and significantly improves the FF of the VASP-Sb2S3 based solar cell (Fig. 4c). On the other hand, the RS is 13.9 and 9.0 Ω cm2 for the CP-Sb2S3 and VASP-Sb2S3 based devices, respectively. The decreased RS in VASP-Sb2S3 leads to improved charge transport efficiency for high JSC.
To further manifest the photocurrent generation, we conducted incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements (Fig. 4d). For both devices based on CP-Sb2S3 and VASP-Sb2S3, the onset IPCE is located at 730 nm, which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption onset as shown in Fig. 2d. The CP-Sb2S3 based device exhibits 50–60% photocurrent generation in 350–650 nm. Extraordinarily, the IPCE of the VASP-Sb2S3 based device exhibits a broad band response with a photocurrent generation of 70−85% in the region 350–650 nm. This result demonstrates a higher photocurrent generation for the VASP-based device. The JSC values integrated from the IPCE correspond well with the J–V measurement (Table 1), indicating the reliability of device characterization.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as an effective tool to evaluate the interfaces for Sb2S3 solar cells was carried out in the dark at a potential of 0.65 V.38 The Nyquist plots of our devices are shown in Fig. 5a, and the corresponding equivalent circuit model is shown in the inset. The result is well fitted with a simple circuit consisting of RS, RREC, and CPE. RS representing series resistance is correlated with the internal resistance. By comparing the fitted value, it can be found that the RS for the VASP-Sb2S3 based device (14.7 Ω cm2) is considerably smaller than that of the CP-Sb2S3 based device (29.2 Ω cm2), which is consistent with the result extracted from J–V curves (Table 1). RREC as the recombination resistance is inversely proportional to charge recombination.39RREC extracted from the arcs is 1.2 kΩ cm2 and 584.8 Ω cm2 for VASP-Sb2S3 and CP-Sb2S3 based devices, respectively. This result suggests that the Sb2S3 precursor film obtained by the VASP method significantly prohibited electron–hole recombination in the device. Therefore, EIS analysis reaffirms that the VASP based approach is able to generate high quality Sb2S3 films with efficient charge transport and impeded carrier recombination. The Bode phase plot is also depicted to probe the dynamics of the charge transfer with the devices based on CP and VASP-Sb2S3 absorber films (Fig. S6†), the characteristic peak frequencies (f) are estimated to be 5279 Hz and 8330 Hz, respectively. In the device based on VASP-Sb2S3, the peak frequency increase indicates that more electrons can be injected into the TiO2 nanorods in the device based on VASP-Sb2S3.40,41 The increased charge injection may have resulted from the high pore filling of Sb2S3 into the TiO2 nanorod arrays and the better contact between Sb2S3 and TiO2. On the other hand, a negative effect is that the high frequency in the Bode plot suggests a short electron lifetime (τn = 1/2πf). However, considering the sensitized device configuration, charge carriers can be effectively transported, the slightly reduced electron lifetime does not play an influential role, while the better interfacial contact, higher pore filling rate and more light absorbing materials (Fig. 2d) of VASP-Sb2S3 still lead to the final PCE improvement. Additionally, EIS spectra at a series of voltages from 0.55 V to 0.75 V under one Sun were also measured and the result is shown in Fig. 5b. It can be seen that the devices exhibit a single semicircle in the complex plane and the diameter is highly dependent on bias. All the semicircles intersect the Z′ axis at a value of 14.7 Ω cm2 at high frequencies and the value at low frequencies depends on the bias.42,43 With the increase in applied voltage, the diameters of the arcs become smaller and smaller, indicating that the charge transfer becomes more and more efficient. This is reasonable since high applied voltage leads to charge transfer becoming dynamically favorable.

The stability of the device was briefly investigated after storage in air with moderate relative humidity (∼40%). After one month, the device (with an initial PCE of 6.78%) without encapsulation maintained a PCE of 6.54% (Fig. 4a and Table 1). This result evidences the excellent stability of Sb2S3 based devices. It is worthy of note that the organic HTM spiro-OMeTAD is applied in this device. Since previous studies have shown that spiro-OMeTAD is prone to degradation especially with addition of lithium salt,44,45 the degradation should mainly result from the organic HTM. It can be readily expected that the device with stable inorganic HTMs would display excellent stability.37
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that high quality Sb2S3 light absorbing materials can be obtained through a vacuum assisted thermal treatment approach. By this method, an Sb2S3 film with high surface coverage, high crystallinity and phase purity is achieved. Electrochemical characterizations show that the carrier recombination is considerably suppressed while the charge transport efficiency is greatly enhanced as a result of the improved film quality. These characteristics enable substantially improved photocurrent density and fill factors. Finally, Sb2S3 solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 6.78% were obtained. Solution processing of semiconducting films relies on organic solvents for dissolving precursor materials, and efficient removal of organic molecules is a decisive factor for high optoelectronic properties. Our study shows that vacuum assisted solution processing is capable of extracting organic molecules from the precursor materials, while it has to be conducted at specific temperature. This research provides an efficient strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance of the Sb2S3 family solar cells and fundamental understanding regarding the solution processed excellent quality metal chalcogenide films.
