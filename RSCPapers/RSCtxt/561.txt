    , Accepted 8th May 2019First published on 8th May 2019AbstractSearching for alternatives to lead-containing metal halide perovskites, we explored the properties of indium-based inorganic double perovskites Cs2InMX6 with M = Cu, Ag, Au and X = Cl, Br, I, and of its organic–inorganic hybrid derivative MA2InCuCl6 (MA = CH3NH3+) using computation within Kohn–Sham density functional theory. Among these compounds, Cs2InCuCl6 and MA2InCuCl6 were found to be potentially promising candidates for solar cells. Calculations with different functionals provided the direct band gap of Cs2InCuCl6 between 1.05 and 1.73 eV. In contrast, MA2InCuCl6 exhibits an indirect band gap between 1.31 and 2.09 eV depending on the choice of exchange–correlation functional. Cs2InCuCl6 exhibits a much higher absorption coefficient than that calculated for c-Si and CdTe, common semiconductors for solar cells. Even MA2InCuCl6 is predicted to have a higher absorption coefficient than c-Si and CdTe across the visible spectrum despite the fact that it is an indirect band gap material. The intrinsic charge carrier mobilities for Cs2InCuCl6 along the L–Γ path are predicted to be comparable to those for MAPbI3. Finally, we carried out calculations of the band edge positions for MA2InCuCl6 and Cs2InCuCl6 to offer guidance for solar cell heterojunction design and optimization. We conclude that Cs2InCuCl6 and MA2InCuCl6 are promising semiconductors for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications.
1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites with the chemical formula ABX3 where A is an inorganic or organic cation (e.g., Cs+, CH3NH3+, etc.), B is a metal (e.g., Pb, Sn, etc.), and X is a halogen (e.g., Cl, Br, or I), are being vigorously explored as materials for low-cost and high efficiency solar cells.1–3 The flurry of activity over this class of materials is fuelled by the remarkable increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) for solar cells based on methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3) from 3.8% in 20094 to a record 23.3% in less than a decade.5–9 These efficiencies are already exceeding the performance of conventional thin film photovoltaic devices based on cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS).6 Importantly, tandem solar cells based on metal halide perovskites are rivalling even crystalline silicon (c-Si) in performance, with PCEs >26% achieved in preliminary devices.10–12 This astounding high efficiency together with their solution processability13 places metal–halide perovskite-based photovoltaics at the forefront of progress in solar photoconversion. It is also becoming clear that metal halide perovskites have broader appeal in applications beyond photovoltaics, and recent research has demonstrated a variety of electronic and optoelectronic devices including transistors,14,15 light emitting diodes,16–18 and lasers.19,20
Lead containing perovskites, however, face two problems, their limited chemical stability21,22 and the negative impact, real or perceived, of lead on the environment and human health.23,24 Rong et al.25 discussed these challenges in a recent review. These issues have motivated a search for lead-free, non-toxic alternatives to MAPbI3. Strategies, pursued both experimentally and via computational screening, include, but are not limited to, substituting lead in APbX3 with non-toxic metals,26–29 exploring structures derived from the aristotype cubic perovskite (e.g., layered perovskites, double perovskites, vacancy-ordered double perovskites, etc.),30,31 and designing new perovskite-inspired materials such as inverse32 or metal-free perovskites.33 Amongst these materials, double perovskites with the general formula A2B1B2X6 where B1 and B2 are formally (3+) and (1+) metallic cations, respectively, have drawn our attention because their chemical diversity can be exploited to tune the optoelectronic functionality. Recently, the inorganic double perovskite Cs2InAgCl6 has been synthesized and claimed to have a direct band gap but its value, 3.3 eV, is too large for application in solar cells.34,35 The analogous Cs2InAgBr6 should have a narrower band gap and has been claimed to be stable via DFT calculations36 but it has not yet been synthesized. When Bi or Sb is substituted for In, the band gap narrows to ∼2 eV but also becomes indirect.37–41 A band gap of 2 eV is still too high for solar cell applications though these materials could be used as the wide gap layer in tandem solar cells. Despite their potential for light harvesting applications, other indium-based double perovskites have not been investigated in detail. Accordingly, we focus on A2InMX6 (A = Cs+, MA+, M = Cu, Ag, Au and X = Cl, Br) and examine their potential for solar cells. The more general question ‘what makes a good solar cell?’ has been addressed elsewhere.42 Briefly, materials suitable for solar cells must exhibit high optical absorption, a band gap located within the broad maximum of the Shockley–Queisser-limit curve (1.0–1.6 eV),43,44 good charge transport properties, and high chemical stability.42 Indeed, lead halide perovskites are excellent light absorbers with tunable band gaps, long charge carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths, and high defect tolerance.1 These are the characteristics that must be examined when seeking an alternative to lead halide perovskites.
We first screened a series of indium-based inorganic double perovskites Cs2InMX6 with M = Cu, Ag, Au and X = Cl, Br, I by means of Kohn–Sham density functional theory45–47 and searched for materials with band gaps in the 1.0–2.0 eV range. We chose the combination of In(III) and M(I) metals instead of In(I) and M(III) because In(I)-based double perovskites are unstable owing to the oxidation of In(I) to In(III).48 This prescreening identified Cs2InCuCl6 as a potential candidate with a band gap in the 1.05–1.73 eV range (depending on the method used for calculation). To inspect the influence of organic cations, we also studied the organic–inorganic hybrid, MA2InCuCl6, by replacing Cs+ with the methylammonium (MA = CH3NH3+) cation and considering different orientations of MA in the octahedral cages. While some articles on Cu–In double perovskites have been published,49,50 Cs2InCuCl6 and MA2InCuCl6 have not been studied systematically and in detail as is done here. In particular, we evaluated the electronic structure, optical absorption coefficient, and intrinsic charge carrier mobility of Cs2InCuCl6 and MA2InCuCl6.
2. Computational methods
2.1 Kohn–Sham DFT calculations
Kohn–Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT)45–47 calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).51–54 To optimize the crystal structures, the PBEsol55 exchange–correlation functional was employed and a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV was used. The convergence criteria for total energy and Hellmann–Feynman force were set to 10−6 eV and 10−3 eV Å−1, respectively. For Cs2InCuBr6 and Cs2InAuBr6, a weaker force of 10−2 eV Å−1 was used due to a difficulty in locating the minimum energy points of these structures. A gamma centered grid of 10 × 10 × 10 was used to sample the first Brillouin zone (FBZ). For the band gap screening, the standard HSE0656 functional (i.e. the screening parameter of 0.2 Å−1 and the exact exchange of 25%) including spin–orbit coupling (SOC), was used with a 4 × 4 × 4 k-mesh. A kinetic cutoff of 400 eV and an energy threshold of 10−5 eV were employed. After screening, for Cs2InCuCl6 and MA2InCuCl6 HSE06-SOC and PBE0-SOC57 were employed to compute their band gaps using a stricter energy threshold of 10−6 eV. We computed the phonon band structure for Cs2InCuCl6 by using Phonopy.58 The phonon calculation was performed using a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell and a 5 × 5 × 5 k-mesh and with the forces computed at the PBEsol level by VASP using a strict energy criteria of 10−10 eV. Small negative acoustic phonon modes at the Γ point, caused by the imperfection of translational symmetry used in the force calculation, were corrected by symmetrizing the calculated forces using the keyword FC_SYMMETRY = 1 in the Phonopy configuration file. Optical absorption coefficients were computed using the PBE59,60 functional and a dense 30 × 30 × 30 k-mesh. We applied a simple scissor correction in plotting the absorption coefficient using the HSE06-SOC and PBE0-SOC band gaps instead of the band gap by the PBE functional which suffers from more severe self-interaction error.61–63 In order to relax the MA2InCuCl6 structures, we first optimized the unit cell size and ion positions while keeping the cell shape unchanged using CRYSTAL1764 and the triple-zeta basis set with polarization quality pob-TZVP65,66 for all the elements. We used CRYSTAL here to preserve the crystal symmetry, i.e. cubic, of the structure during the geometrical relaxation because VASP does not support this function. Next, using VASP, we relaxed the ion positions and the lattice parameters while keeping the cell shape unchanged. Within this approach, the optimized MA2InCuCl6 (HA or HB) structure has the same computational cubic unit cell as Cs2InCuCl6 and their corresponding FBZ can be sampled with the same paths when analyzing the band structure. Computational details for standard semiconductors such as c-Si and CdTe are provided in section S1 of the ESI.†
2.2 Charge transport calculations
The intrinsic charge carrier mobility was calculated using the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE)67 in conjunction with the Deformation Potential (DP)68 theory. In this approach, acoustic phonon scattering is the only mechanism considered in computing the relaxation time and the mobility μ is given by  where C, E1, m*, e, ℏ, kB, and T are the elastic constant, the DP constant, the effective mass, the elementary charge, the reduced Planck constant, the Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively. To compute the DP constant, E1, the band edge energy shift with respect to the dilation, Δl/lo (where lo and Δl are the equilibrium lattice parameter and its change caused by the strain, respectively), was fitted using linear regression. The elastic constant C was obtained by fitting a parabola to the variation of the unit cell electronic energy E with respect to the dilation Δl/lo around the equilibrium point, lo. The effective masses of the holes and the electrons were calculated from the curvatures of the parabolas fitted to the variation of the valence (for holes) and conduction band (for electrons) edge energies with respect to the momentum k (i.e., E(k) dispersion). See section S5 of the ESI† for details.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Band gap screening
First, we screened different M and X in the Cs2InMX6 structure (M = Cu, Ag, Au and X = Cl, Br, I) to identify those compounds with a band gap in the 1.0–2.0 eV range. All structures were taken to be cubic as all experimentally reported double-perovskites have a cubic structure. Fig. 1a shows the Cs2InMX6 primitive unit cell used in the calculation, and the corresponding first Brillouin zone (FBZ). We calculated Goldschmidt's empirical factors69 to evaluate the relative stability of these hypothetical compounds before performing extensive electronic structure calculations (see the ESI, section S2, Fig. S1†). The tolerance and octahedral factors predict that most of these perovskite structures should be stable except for Cs2InCuI6: the octahedral factor for Cs2InCuI6 is slightly smaller than the requisite value, 0.41. According to the Shockley–Queisser limit,43,44 a solar cell based on a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.0–1.6 eV will have a maximum efficiency of 30–33%. We choose a wider range, 1.0–2.0 eV, for screening because the exchange–correlation functional approximation carries uncertainties in predicting the band gap, and many photovoltaic semiconductors have band gaps falling within this range including crystalline silicon c-Si (1.17 eV),70 CdTe (1.61 eV),71 CdSe (1.74 eV),70 GaAs (1.52 eV),70etc. Of the nine compounds considered, only Cs2InCuCl6 and Cs2InAgBr6 have band gaps falling in this range. Previous computational studies predicted the band gap of Cs2InAgBr6 to be 1.0–2.0 eV (ref. 34 and 36) and already identified this compound as a potential solar absorber, thus we do not consider this compound any further in our study. Fig. 2 shows the phonon band structure for Cs2InCuCl6. These calculations predict several vibrational modes in the 50–150 cm−1 range and at ∼225 cm−1 that could be detected using low-frequency Raman spectroscopy. There are no imaginary modes in the entire FBZ, establishing the dynamical stability of Cs2InCuCl6 in its cubic phase. This is different from CsPbI3 where there are imaginary phonon modes in its phonon dispersion curve triggering the phase transition as the temperature or pressure changes.72 In addition, we compute the decomposition enthalpy (ΔHd) considering several possible pathways by means of the PBEsol functional (Table 1). Our results show that most of the decomposition reactions are thermodynamically unfavorable except for reaction (5) which has negative ΔHd. Also, the entropy and kinetic factors are not considered and the negative ΔHd is quite small (ca. −3.7 kcal per mol per formula unit). Hence, we conclude that Cs2InCuCl6 is thermodynamically metastable. It is worth noting that a previous combined DFT and experiment study by Xiao et al.73 has concluded that Cu(I) double perovskites Cs2InCuX6 are thermodynamically unstable owing to the high energy of the 3d state of Cu. However, their DFT calculations were performed using PBE approximation which has been proved to be inaccurate for double perovskites’ thermodynamic stability prediction.74 While we agree on the trend that other structures in the series with large anions might be unstable, we anticipate that Cs2InCuCl6 may be stable and further attempts on synthesizing it may be warranted, particularly in the thin film form where metastable states may be stabilized kinetically or thermodynamically on appropriate substrates. Having found Cs2InCuCl6 to be stable and to have a suitable band gap, we investigated its other properties as well as the properties of its organic–inorganic hybrid derivative MA2InCuCl6, which are discussed next.

3.2 Geometrical and electronic structures
One of the main challenges in simulating hybrid halide perovskites is the dynamic disorder caused by the CH3NH3+ cation.75–78 Due to small energy barriers between its multiple isoenergetic local minima at different orientations, the CH3NH3+ cations can rotate almost freely within the cuboctahedral cavity of the inorganic framework. There are two possible approaches to account for structural dynamic disorder. In one approach, one can perform dynamics simulations (either ab initio or classical) to directly capture the structural dynamics of the system, followed by the electronic structure calculations for some selected configurations.79 This approach allows one to calculate the time-averaged properties of the system, which produces results such as the density of states broadening in MAPbI380 or the phase transitions from cubic to tetragonal and from tetragonal to orthorhombic phases upon cooling81 all challenging to capture using static calculations. The electronic structure, however, becomes difficult to analyze because of symmetry breaking in dynamic simulations. Alternatively, in a second approach, one can consider several dominant dynamic orientations of the CH3NH3+ ions from X-ray diffraction and identify a few important local minima using static DFT calculations, while preserving the crystallographic symmetry.82–85 Recently, by sampling different configurations in the energy landscape Tan et al.86 have found that there exist a few dominant configurations of MAPbI3 at room temperature due to the hydrogen bonding and lattice distortion. Following this idea, we constructed MA2InCuCl6 from the Cs2InCuCl6 primitive cell by considering two most dominant orientations of CH3NH3+ inside the octahedral cage, namely HA and HB as shown in Fig. 3. Although the initial structures for MA2InCuCl6 have no distortion of the MCl6 octahedra in comparison to the Cs2InCuCl6 structure, the final optimized structures show slightly distorted MCl6 units and a rearrangement of the CH3NH3+ ions (Fig. 3). This distortion presumably occurs because of the hydrogen bonding between the N–H groups of the CH3NH3+ ions and the Cl atoms of the MCl6 units, which has been observed in MAPbI3.87 Additionally, we find that MA2InCuCl6 (HB) is 0.05 eV lower in energy than MA2InCuCl6 (HA), hence they are isoenergetic within the limits of the density functional approximation.

A previous study showed that HSE06 and PBE0 can provide lower and upper bounds for the band gaps of halide double perovskites, respectively.34 Hence, we calculated band gaps for Cs2InCuCl6 and MA2InCuCl6 (HA and HB) using both HSE06-SOC and PBE0-SOC (Table 2). Using this approach, we place the lower and upper limits on the Cs2InCuCl6 band gap at 1.05 and 1.73 eV, respectively, within the broad maximum of the Shockley–Queisser-limit curve. The limits on the MA2InCuCl6 band gap are about 0.3 eV larger. There is no significant difference in the band gaps for the HA and HB configurations; the band gap calculated using the HB configuration is approximately 0.1 eV larger than that calculated using the HA configuration. Interestingly, we find that there is a direct-to-indirect transition of the band gap in going from Cs2InCuCl6 to MA2InCuCl6. That is Cs2InCuCl6 is a direct band gap semiconductor while MA2InCuCl6 has an indirect band gap. The conduction band minimum (CBM) for all the structures is at the Γ point, while the valence band maximum (VBM) for Cs2InCuCl6, MA2InCuCl6 (HA), and MA2InCuCl6 (HB) is at the Γ, X, and L points, respectively (Fig. 4). The difference between the indirect and direct band gap for MA2InCuCl6 (HA and HB) is reported in the ESI section S4.† In the following, we analyze and discuss the band structures to gain insight into this direct-to-indirect transition. Fig. 4 shows the electronic band structures for Cs2InCuCl6 and MA2InCuCl6 (HA and HB). For Cs2InCuCl6, the valence band along the Γ–X path is flat. This is expected for indium-containing inorganic double perovskites due to the two-dimensional character of the wave function.34 For MA2InCuCl6, CH3NH3+ distorts the MCl6 units as shown in Fig. 3, splitting the highest and the second highest valence bands along the L–Γ direction. Consequently, the two non-degenerate valence bands are observed in the entire FBZ of MA2InCuCl6 (HA and HB). Because of this distortion and the presence of CH3NH3+ in the cuboctahedral cavities, MA2InCuCl6 structures have lower symmetry (P1) compared to the highly symmetric Cs2InCuCl6 (Fmm). This symmetry breaking, upon substitution of Cs+ with CH3NH3+, pushes the top of the valence band to the X and L points in MA2InCuCl6 (HA) and MA2InCuCl6 (HB), respectively, and ultimately causes the direct-to-indirect transition of the band gap. This interpretation is further informed by analyzing the density of states (see Fig. 5). We only present the HSE06-SOC density of states because the band curvatures by HSE06-SOC and PBE0-SOC look alike as shown in Fig. 4, implying that the PBE0-SOC density of states, if computed, will look identical to that by HSE06-SOC except for the difference in the band gap. In fact, CH3NH3+ does not contribute to the band edges (i.e., CBM and VBM) of MA2InCuCl6, similar to the insignificant role of Cs+ in the CBM and VBM of Cs2InCuCl6. For both Cs2InCuCl6 and MA2InCuCl6, the CB is composed of the In s and Cl p orbitals while the VB is composed of the Cu d and Cl p orbitals (Fig. 5). In addition, we find that there is a density of states broadening in the conduction band of MA2InCuCl6 in comparison to that of Cs2InCuCl6. To confirm whether this is a consequence of the lower symmetry or an intrinsic property of MA2InCuCl6, we would need to perform a dynamic simulation or experimentally determine the density of states, which is beyond the scope of the current study.

3.3 Absolute band edge positions
The knowledge of band edge positions is important for designing solar cells and junctions in solar cells. Herein, we combine two different techniques to compute the absolute band edges: (i) surface band alignment88,89 for Cs2InCuCl6 and (ii) core-level alignment90 for (MA)2InCuCl6 (HA and HB). Specifically, for Cs2InCuCl6 we construct and use a slab model to compute the absolute VBM and CBM energies with respect to the vacuum level. We use both HSE06 and PBE0 functionals and neglect the effect of spin–orbit coupling due to the expensive cost of the slab calculation. This approach, however, is neither feasible nor straightforward for (MA)2InCuCl6 because of two issues. First, more than one slab model of (MA)2InCuCl6 need to be considered because the crystal structure with CH3NH3+ ions is anisotropic. Second, the slab calculation using the hybrid functions (HSE06 or PBE0) for (MA)2InCuCl6 is even more costly than that for the inorganic derivative. Instead, we use the Cu p core level as the reference state for both Cs2InCuCl6 and (MA)2InCuCl6 and the absolute band edges of (MA)2InCuCl6 are determined using this electronic marker and the absolute band edges of Cs2InCuCl6. Details of the band edge calculations can be found in the ESI, section S3.†

Fig. 6 shows the band offsets for Cs2InCuCl6 and (MA)2InCuCl6 (HA and HB) computed in this work, and for other semiconductors, such as TiO2 and MAPbI3 from the literature for reference.89 There is a negligible difference of ca. 0.1–0.2 eV between the band edges of Cs2InCuCl6 and (MA)2InCuCl6 regardless of the functional choice, reaffirming the unimportant role of the organic ions in determining the electronic structure of the band edges in hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites. In general, the absolute energy of the VBM is within −4.3 and −4.1 eV and that of the CBM is between −6.2 and −6.1 eV. The CBM of Cs2InCuCl6 and (MA)2InCuCl6 is slightly lower than that of MAPbI3 irrespective of whether HSE06 or PBE0 is used. In contrast, the VBM computed by PBE0 is significantly lower than the VBM of MAPbI3 (about 0.7–0.8 eV) while HSE06 predicts a small difference of 0.2–0.3 eV. It is not feasible to comment on which functional is more accurate in this case due to the lack of experimental values.

3.4 Optical properties
We investigated the theoretical optical properties of Cs2InCuCl6 and (MA)2InCuCl6. We use the PBE functional to obtain the frequency-dependent dielectric matrix needed for the absorption coefficient calculation (see the ESI, section S4†) and the HSE06-SOC or PBE0-SOC band gaps (as discussed in the Computational method section) to plot the optical absorption coefficient shown in Fig. 7. The same calculations are conducted for c-Si and CdTe and for the previously synthesized34 double perovskite Cs2InAgCl6 to compare with Cs2InCuCl6 and (MA)2InCuCl6. Amongst all the materials in Fig. 7, Cs2InCuCl6 has the highest absorption coefficient irrespective of the functional choice for the band gap correction. Surprisingly, the (MA)2InCuCl6 absorption coefficient is higher than that of c-Si and CdTe despite the fact that (MA)2InCuCl6 is an indirect band gap material.

3.5 Intrinsic charge carrier mobility for Cs2InCuCl6
Finally, we discuss the charge transport properties of Cs2InCuCl6. For the hybrid perovskite (MA)2InCuCl6, it is challenging to perform the same calculation due to the high computational cost. We only compute the mobility along the L–Γ path since the effective mass approximation cannot be applied for the flat valence band along the Γ–X path. The L–Γ path corresponds to a path along In, Cs, and Cu in the real space. To compute the intrinsic charge carrier mobility, we used the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE)67 and the Deformation Potential (DP)68 theory as discussed in the Computational methods section. The DP theory was originally devised to compute the mobility in non-polar crystals but has since been used to study charge transport in many other materials, including organic semiconductors,91 graphene and graphene nanoribbons,92 molybdenum disulfide,93 and black phosphorus.94 Recently, Zhao et al.95 employed a similar approach to study intrinsic and extrinsic charge transport in MAPbI3. Although this method has been successful in predicting intrinsic mobilities for low-dimensional materials, it can potentially carry large errors because carriers are assumed to scatter only from acoustic phonons. Other scattering mechanisms from optical phonons, defects, and impurities are neglected. Consequently, the experimentally measured mobilities turn out to be much smaller than the computed values. In practice the experimental mobilities vary with synthesis attesting to the importance of defects such as grain boundaries and impurities.96 Considering these limitations, we chose to compare our calculated mobilities with the theoretical intrinsic mobility of MAPbI3 reported in the literature.95

Fig. 8 shows the trigonal Cs2InCuCl6 unit cell and its FBZ used in the transport calculation. In this unit cell, In, Cs, and Cu atoms are aligned (i.e., the L–Γ path) along the z-axis. Thus, a dilation Δl/lo, a strain, can be applied by simply varying the lattice parameter, c, and then calculating the deformation potential and the elastic constant in the manner described in the Computational methods section. Further details are also reported in section S5 of the ESI.†Table 3 shows the deformation potential constant (E1), the elastic constant (C), the relaxation time (τ), and the intrinsic mobility (μ) of holes and electrons for Cs2InCuCl6 at 300 K. We find that the electron and hole mobilities in Cs2InCuCl6 are approximately 4500 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1200 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These values are comparable to those calculated for MAPbI3 for which the hole and electron mobilities are 1400–7000 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 500–2500 cm2 V−1 s−1,95 respectively (the mobility values from the literature depend on the transport direction, hence we provide them as a range to facilitate the comparison with our values). Regarding the deformation potential constant, both materials show strong scattering of electrons by lattice vibrations, i.e. large E1 for electrons, presumably implying a lower electron mobility compared to that of the hole for MAPbI3 and Cs2InCuCl6. Indeed, MAPbI3 has lower electron mobilities than the hole mobilities. This trend, however, is reversed for Cs2InCuCl6 where electron mobilities are higher. The high electron mobilities in Cs2InCuCl6 can be explained by inspecting the effective mass. In fact, the hole effective mass (0.92me) for Cs2InCuCl6 is three times larger than the electron effective mass (0.30me), hence this large hole effective mass lowers the hole mobility. In contrast, the hole effective mass (0.25–0.60me) for MAPbI3 is only two times larger than the electron effective mass (0.15–0.30me) (see the ESI of ref. 95). To summarize, Cs2InCuCl6 exhibits charge mobilities comparable to MAPbI3, which bodes well for its potential as a solar cell material. While we calculated charge transport along the L–Γ path we note that the hole mobility in Cs2InCuCl6 in other directions (e.g., Γ–X path) may be smaller because the valence band is flatter along other directions, reducing the average hole mobility. Examining the curvature of the conduction band at the Γ point, we expect the electron mobility along the Γ–X path to be similar to that along the Γ–L path.

Table 3 Deformation potential constant (E1), elastic constant (C), relaxation time (τ), and intrinsic mobilities (μ) for Cs2InCuCl6 at 300 K. The MAPbI3 data are taken from ref. 93. A range for each quantity is given because charge transport is anisotropic in MAPbI3 crystals and values correspond to upper and lower bounds, or the fastest and slowest transport directions

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have identified Cs2InCuCl6 as a promising semiconductor with a suitable band gap for solar cells. Its dynamic stability is confirmed by phonon calculations. We have shown that Cs2InCuCl6 and its hybrid derivative (MA)2InCuCl6 exhibit optimal band gaps and remarkable optical properties in comparison with other conventional semiconductors. Furthermore, charge transport in Cs2InCuCl6 is facile and this material is predicted to have an intrinsic charge carrier mobility similar to that of MAPbI3 along the L–Γ path of the FBZ. Additionally, we have performed a band edge energy calculation for Cs2InCuCl6 and (MA)2InCuCl6 in order to inform future integration of these materials into solar cells. We anticipate the promising applications of these hypothetical compounds, if synthesized in the laboratory, as non-toxic semiconductors for developing optoelectronic devices.
