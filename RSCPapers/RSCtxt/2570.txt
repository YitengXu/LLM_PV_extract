    , Accepted 30th August 2022First published on 1st September 2022AbstractNiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) has been considered as a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. However, its electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is inferior. Here, we report a novel strategy for substantially improving the HER electrocatalytic activity of NiFe-LDH as well as retaining its OER performance through facile and low-consumption NH3-inducing at room temperature. The representative sample (NiFe-LDH2.18) shows a unique hierarchical architecture and a modulated electronic state, exhibiting more available active sites, more unobstructed channels for gas release, and faster electron/ion transfer rate. In an alkaline medium, NiFe-LDH2.18 exhibits excellent HER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 95 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, being much superior to that of original NiFe-LDH. Moreover, its impressive OER performance is well retained, requiring an overpotential of 227 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm−2. Thanks to the excellent HER/OER performance of NiFe-LDH2.18, remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward full water splitting has been achieved.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen has been generally considered as a new type of sustainable energy and natural energy (solar energy and wind energy) carrier, which can alleviate the increasingly terrible energy crisis and environmental pollution.1,2 While the practical application of hydrogen energy relies on the development of low cost and high efficiency water splitting technology,3–6 until now, large-scale water splitting has been hindered by the high overpotentials for both sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).7–9 Such overpotentials could be reduced by using effective electrocatalysts, which is a promising strategy to decrease the energy consumption of hydrogen manufacturing. At present, the best electrocatalysts toward the HER and OER in industrial production are Pt/C and RuO2/IrO2, respectively. But the high price and scarce reserves of these precious metals greatly limit the development of hydrogen production technology by water splitting.10,11 Therefore, abundant and low-cost transition metal-based catalysts (such as phosphates, sulfides, nitrides, oxides, hydroxide, etc.) have attracted much attention from global researchers in recent years.6,12,13 Specifically, self-supported NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) has been reported as one of the most promising electrocatalysts toward the OER, owing to its high conductivity, tunable physicochemical properties, abundant active sites, the high intrinsic activity of Ni-based compounds and the synergistic effect of Ni/Fe species during the process of electrolysis.14 However, the HER performance of self-supported NiFe-LDH is rather inferior in alkaline environments, which could not be competent in overall water splitting.
Given that the surficial catalytic activity of nano-materials can be finely tuned by morphology control, functional materials with various geometric structures have been rationally designed.15–18 Nevertheless, the traditional one-dimensional or two-dimensional structure usually could be stacked one on top of another, reducing the available surface and performance during the catalytic process.19 By contrast, hierarchical nanostructures have a lot of advantages as electrocatalysts, such as expanded surface area, increased active sites, reduced diffusion lengths, enhanced mechanical stability, stronger electrolyte penetration and larger free space conducive to the rapid release of gas.20,21 Thereby, it can be expected that hierarchical electrocatalysts might exhibit improved catalytic performance per unit area.6,22–24 However, hierarchical nanostructures are usually prepared step by step via a tedious and complex building-up process, such as electrodeposition, hydrothermal, template or combined application of various methods, which is a significant snag for the practical application. In recent years, corrosion engineering has been employed as a low-cost and energy-saving strategy to gently synthesize NiFe-LDH as an effective electrocatalyst via a concise and scalable preparation process.25–27 By adjusting the corrosion conditions (such as corrosion solution, substrate, temperature, etc.), the geometric structure and catalytic performance of NiFe-LDH can be easily and reasonably regulated.25,28 From this, corrosion engineering might be a more promising method to prepare highly active electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.29
In this study, we report a unique and facile corrosion engineering strategy to synthesize NiFe-LDH nanosheets with legible hierarchical nanostructures, achieving a remarkable enhancement of HER performance. Starting from pure nickel foam, self-supported hierarchical NiFe-LDH nanosheets, i.e., large nanosheets composed of small nanosheets, are obtained through soaking in FeCl3 solution followed by NH3-inducing at room temperature. By adjusting the concentration of NH3 in air, the resulting hierarchical nanostructures could be further tailored. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure and modulated electronic state, the optimized self-supported NiFe-LDH nanosheets exhibit remarkable HER, OER and overall water splitting performances in 1.0 M KOH solution.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
FeCl3·6H2O (AR), CH3COCH3 (AR), CH3CH2OH (AR) and KOH (AR) were purchased from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (AR) was obtained from Xilong Chemical Co. HCl (AR) and NH3·H2O (25–28 wt%) were purchased from Nanjing Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd.
2.2. Preparation of materials
In order to remove the oxide (NiO) and possible dirt on the surface of nickel foam (NF), a piece of NF (1 × 0.5 cm2) was cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in 1.0 M HCl solution, ethanol and deionized water for 10 min, respectively. The cleansed NF was soaked in FeCl3 solution (0.5 M) for 4 min, then immediately put in a mixed atmosphere of air and NH3, and allowed to stand for 10 h. After that, the unstable phase generated on the surface of NF was removed by ultrasonic treatment, and the final product is labelled NiFe-LDHx, where x is the concentration of NH3 (x = 0.44, 1.31, 2.18, 3.05, and 4.36 wt‰). For comparison, NiFe-LDH0 was also synthesized via the method reported in our previous work.29
2.3. Materials characterization
The morphology and structure of the samples in this work were observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, SSX-550) and transmission electron microscope (TEM; CM100). The elemental composition and valence state were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB250Xi). The collected spectra were calibrated with the C 1s peak (284.6 eV). The crystalline phase of these samples was detected using an X-ray diffraction instrument (XRD, XPERT, Panalytical) with Cu Kα radiation. The Raman spectra were collected on a LabRAM Aramis instrument (Raman, HORIBA, Ltd., 532 nm excitation laser).
2.4. Electrochemical performances
All electrochemical performances were tested on an electrochemical workstation (CHENHUA, CHI660E). In a typical three-electrode configuration, the as-obtained sample acts as the working electrode (1 × 0.5 cm2), a graphite rod and Hg/HgO electrode as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. All electrochemical tests with iR correction of 95% were carried out in N2 (for HER)/O2 (for OER)-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution. The Tafel slope was calculated from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves based on the equation: η = a + blog|j|, where η is the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, and j is the current density, respectively. The TOF value was calculated through the following equation: TOF = jS/4Fn, where j is the current density (A cm−2) at η = 174 mV, S is the geometric area of the working electrode (0.5 cm2), F is the Faraday constant with a value of 96485 C mol−1, and n is the number of moles of active materials (mol).6 The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was evaluated via the double-layer charging capacitance (Cdl) obtained from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves recorded from 0.624 V to 0.724 V (vs. RHE). The overall water splitting test was carried out in a single-compartment electrolytic cell, and the electrolyte was 1.0 M KOH solution.
All potentials in this work have been converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale.
For comparison, Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts were also loaded on nickel foam (1 × 0.5 cm2) to perform electrochemical tests.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis process of NiFe-LDH0 and NiFe-LDH2.18
As illustrated in Scheme 1, NiFe-LDH0 with an array structure was prepared via corrosion engineering,29i.e. immersing nickel foam in 0.5 M FeCl3 solution for 4 min and then drying in air at room temperature. In the preparation process of NiFe-LDH0, the nickel foam not only acted as a skeleton, but also as the Ni source. FeCl3 was employed as an oxidant (Ni + 2Fe3+ → Ni2+ + 2Fe2+) as well as a source of Fe3+ for the formation of NiFe-LDH. The oxygen reduction reaction generates OH− (O2 + 2H2O + 4e− → 4OH−), resulting in the heterogeneous precipitation of NiFe-LDH nanosheets. NiFe-LDH2.18 with hierarchical architecture was synthesized via a similar procedure except for drying in a mixed atmosphere of air and NH3. NH3 is soluble in water and produces OH− (NH3 + H2O → NH3·H2O  NH4+ + OH−) around nickel foam. Combined with the oxygen reduction reaction, NH3-inducing will lead to a high pH of the solution around the nickel foam, and accelerate the co-precipitation of metal ions (Ni2+ and Fe3+) and the in situ growth of NiFe-LDH (Ni2+ + Fe3+ + OH− → NiFe-LDH). Moreover, the reversible ionization process of NH3·H2O makes the pH value of solution around nickel foam stay in a relatively stable range, leading to the formation of a uniform structure.30

3.2. Structural characterization
The morphology and nanostructure of bare nickel foam and NiFe-LDH2.18 were first observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Fig. S1† shows that the bare nickel foam has a rough surface with lots of holes and pits. After soaking it in FeCl3 solution and drying in a mixed atmosphere of air and NH3, the surface of the nickel foam was uniformly covered with a layer of nanosheets (Fig. 1a and b). The enlarged SEM image clearly shows the hierarchical feature of NiFe-LDH2.18 nanosheets, i.e., lots of secondary small nanosheets grown on primary nanosheets, and such hierarchical nanosheets are intersected with each other to form a porous architecture (Fig. 1c). In order to obtain more detailed structural information about the NiFe-LDH2.18 sample, its morphology was further observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1d and e, it is clear that the hierarchical structure is formed in NiFe-LDH2.18. The size of primary nanosheets is over 1 μm, and that of secondary nanosheets is about 150 nm. HR-TEM images (Fig. 1f and g) clearly show the stratified structure of the LDH nanosheet, and the thickness of one secondary nanosheet is about 10 nm. In addition, lattice fringes of LDH nanosheets with interplanar spacings of 0.26 and 0.23 nm are also visible, well matching with the (012) and (015) facets of NiFe-LDH (Fe2Ni2(CO3)(OH)8, PDF# 49-0188).

There are significant differences existing among the structures of the samples prepared in the mixed atmosphere with different concentrations of NH3. As shown in Fig. S2,† as the concentration of NH3 is increased, remarkable changes appear on the surface colors of the obtained samples. As shown in Fig. 2a, when the surrounding atmosphere is pure air, the as-obtained NiFe-LDH0 presents a morphology in which the surface of nickel foam is uniformly covered by a layer of vertical nanosheet array, and the lateral size of these nanosheets is about 100 nm. As the concentration of NH3 in the reaction atmosphere is 0.44 wt‰, the size of nanosheets on the surface of the nickel foam exceeds 300 nm, and the resulting NiFe-LDH0.44 looks like a honeycomb-like porous structure formed by interlacing petal-like nanosheets vertically on the nickel foam (Fig. 2b). When the concentration of NH3 is 1.31 wt‰, the petal-like nanosheet with a smooth surface is wrapped by an irregular smog-like structure, and the thickness of the wrapped nanosheet is about 100 nm (Fig. 2c). As the concentration of NH3 is increased to 2.18 wt‰, the irregular smog-like structure on the surface of nanosheets turns into small thin slices with distinct contours, forming a hierarchical and porous sheet structure with a large size over 1 μm (Fig. 2d). When the concentration of NH3 is further increased to 3.05 and 4.36 wt‰, it is found that the hierarchical structure of the large sheets fades away (Fig. 2e), but the thick (>150 nm) sheets with jumbo size over 1 μm are born. These nanosheets are stacked on each other, reducing the porosity (Fig. 2f). Such a heavily stacked construction leads to the active phases covering each other, which reduces the number of available active sites, lowers the interfacial area between the catalyst and electrolyte, and seriously increases the resistance for the transportation of reactants and the release of generated gases.

According to the principle of chemical dynamics, the size of the crystal is highly depended on its growth rate. NiFe-LDH0 and NiFe-LDHx go through the same synthetic processes except for the concentration of NH3. When the surrounding atmosphere is air, only a little of OH− derived from the oxygen reduction reaction exists in the solution around the nickel foam. Therefore, the crystal of NiFe-LDH0 grows slowly and the final product shows a uniform array architecture formed by small nanosheets (∼100 nm). By contrast, the introduction of NH3 generates more OH− around the after-immersion nickel foam, which remarkably increases the rate of crystal growth and results in the formation of large nanosheets. This also can be confirmed from Fig. 2a–e, showing that the size of NiFe-LDH nanosheets is persistently increased with the concentration of NH3. When the excess NH3 is added, oversize NiFe-LDH nanosheets are congested with each other (Fig. 2f). Hence, the different amounts of OH− in the solution around the nickel foam might be the possible reason for the structural evolution of NiFe-LDH.
XRD patterns were collected to identify the species, composition and crystal structure of the resulting NiFe-LDHx. Due to the strong diffraction peaks of the nickel foam substrate, the diffraction peaks of NiFe-LDH0.44 are relatively weak and invisible, while the small peak at 2θ = 11.8° in the XRD patterns of NiFe-LDH1.31, NiFe-LDH2.18, NiFe-LDH3.05 and NiFe-LDH4.36 well matches the (003) planes of Fe2Ni2(CO3)(OH)8 (Fig. S3†). To reduce the peak intensity of nickel foam and reveal the difference between NiFe-LDH0 and NiFe-LDH2.18, the XRD patterns of exfoliated NiFe-LDH2.18 and NiFe-LDH0 are shown in Fig. 3a. It can be found that NiFe-LDH2.18 exhibits five peaks at 11.8, 23.8, 34.7, 60.3 and 61.7°, which can be assigned to the (003), (006), (012), (110) and (113) planes of Fe2Ni2(CO3)(OH)8 (PDF#49-0188), respectively. On the other hand, NiFe-LDH0 presents five peaks at 11.31, 22.94, 34.58, 38.84, 46.34, 60.33 and 61.00°, which can be attributed to the (003), (006), (012), (015), (018), (0015) and (113) planes of Ni5.64Fe2.36(OH)16(CO3)1.18 (PDF# 51-0463). Compared with that in NiFe-LDH0, the atomic ratio of Ni to Fe in NiFe-LDH2.18 is decreased from 2.39 to 1. The ratio of Fe and Ni (1:1) in NiFe-LDH2.18 is also proved using an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer. The different atomic ratio of Ni to Fe in NiFe-LDH nanosheets will cause the difference in the charge distribution between Ni and Fe, thereby regulating the binding energies of intermediates and affecting the electrocatalytic performance.31

Electronic engineering is an effective strategy to remarkably improve the electrocatalytic properties of a catalyst.32 To be specific, the charge and spin ordering of a catalytic material can be tuned by structural modification and composition regulation.14,33,34 The modulated electronic structure could significantly influence the active sites, adsorption energy of the intermediates and the intrinsic electrical conductivity, which directly determine the intrinsic catalytic activity and kinetics of a catalyst.35,36 The superficial chemical composition and elemental valence states of NiFe-LDH2.18 and NiFe-LDH0 were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Ni, Fe and O can be detected from the surface layer of NiFe-LDH nanosheets (Fig. S4†). Fig. 3b shows the high-resolution Ni 2p XPS spectra, with the typical peaks of Ni2+ located around 855 and 873 eV, accompanied by a pair of satellite peaks (∼861 and 879 eV).37 The broad peaks near 712 and 725 eV in Fig. 3c are the characteristic XPS peaks of Fe3+, revealing that Fe3+ is the predominant chemical state of the Fe element on the surface of NiFe-LDH2.18 and NiFe-LDH0 samples.38 The peaks around 529 and 531 eV in O 1s XPS spectra can be ascribed to M-OH and M-O bonds (Fig. 3d).37,38 Although the surface layers of NiFe-LDH2.18 and NiFe-LDH0 contain roughly the same chemical environment and element valence states, it can be easily found from Fig. 3b–d that there are significant differences in the values of electron binding energy of the same element. Compared to pristine NiFe-LDH0, the Ni2+ 2p3/2 and Fe3+ 2p3/2 peaks of NiFe-LDH2.18 shift negatively by 0.38 and 1.99 eV, respectively, indicating the significant increase of the electron density on Ni and Fe sites. In contrast, the binding energy of the O 1s peak is shifted positively by 0.30 eV, indicating a decreased electron density around the O atom. These results demonstrate that there are electrons transferred from the O atom to Ni and Fe atoms after NH3-inducing, indicating that the electronic structure on the surface of NiFe-LDH nanosheets has been modulated owing to the change in chemical composition (atomic ratio of Ni and Fe elements) and morphology. Such a modulated electronic configuration may optimize the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates on the active sites, and thus enhance the HER electrocatalytic activity of NiFe-LDH2.18.
3.3. Electrochemical characterization
To investigate the influence of NH3-inducing on the electrochemical performance, the HER electrocatalytic activities of NiFe-LDH2.18 and NiFe-LDH0 were first tested using linear scan voltammetry (LSV) in N2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the HER electrocatalytic activity of NiFe-LDH2.18 induced by NH3 is significantly enhanced, with the overpotentials of 95 (η10), 146 (η50) and 174 (η100) mV to achieve current densities of 10, 50 and 100 mA cm−2. These values are much lower than those of the original NiFe-LDH (η10 = 166 mV, η50 = 224 mV, η100 = 254 mV) and many other transition-metal-based HER catalysts reported in the literature (Fig. S5 and Table S1 for a detailed comparison†).39–42 It is worth noting that NiFe-LDH2.18 also displays higher HER electrocatalytic activity than the commercial Pt/C/NF catalyst under a large current density (>100 mA cm−2). Tafel slopes were calculated from LSV curves to ascertain the rate-determining steps (Fig. 4c). The Tafel slope value of NiFe-LDH2.18 (72.2 mV dec−1) is in the range of 40–120 mV dec−1, demonstrating that the HER process on the NiFe-LDH2.18 electrode is the Volmer–Heyrovsky reaction mechanism, and the electrochemical desorption step (Volmer reaction) is the rate-determining step.43 The turnover frequency (TOF) can be used to evaluate the intrinsic activity of an electrocatalyst. We assume that a couple of Ni and Fe atoms in NiFe-LDH are one active site for the HER, and all metal atoms are available for the catalytic process.6,44 The TOF value of the NiFe-LDH2.18 catalyst is 0.059 s−1 at the overpotential of 174 mV (j = 100 mA cm−2), which is higher than that of NiFe-LDH0 (0.050 s−1). Such TOF values indicate that the NH3-inducing is indeed a feasible method to improve the HER performance of NiFe-LDH.

Generally, HER electrocatalytic activity is dominated by the density of exposed active sites and accessible active surface areas to a large extent. The electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) of NiFe-LDH2.18 and NiFe-LDH0 were estimated based on the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) value, as shown in Fig. 4d and Fig. S6.† The calculated Cdl values are 3.61 and 1.00 mF cm−2 for NiFe-LDH2.18 and NiFe-LDH0, respectively. This indicates that NiFe-LDH2.18 has more available active sites for the HER.45 NH3-inducing also plays an important role in the electronic conductivity of NiFe-LDH nanosheets, which can be demonstrated by the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). As shown in Fig. 4e, after the NH3-inducing, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) is decreased from 4.14 to 2.08 Ω. In addition, among all NiFe-LDHx samples, NiFe-LDH2.18 shows the smallest Rct value (Fig. S7†), suggesting its high charge transport efficiency.46,47
The electrochemical stability of the NiFe-LDH2.18 electrode for the HER was evaluated by long-term CV and chronopotentiometric tests. As shown in Fig. 4f, the HER polarization curves reveal an inconsiderable difference before and after continuous CV scanning for 5000 cycles, and the electrocatalytic activity displays no obvious decay after a 20 h HER process under a large current density of 100 mA cm−2. Moreover, the hierarchical nanostructure and crystal structure of NiFe-LDH2.18 are completely maintained after the durability test (Fig. S8 and S9†), indicating its remarkable structural and electrochemical durability.
In order to further verify the vital function of NH3, we also systematically explored the HER electrocatalytic properties of NiFe-LDHx prepared under different concentrations of NH3. As shown in Fig. S10a,† with the increased concentration of NH3, the η10 of the resulting samples first decreases from 171 mV to 95 mV, and then increases to 110 mV, and NiFe-LDH2.18 has the highest HER electrocatalytic activity. The Tafel slopes calculated from the corresponding LSV curves (Fig. S10b†), and Cdl values (Fig. S11†) of NiFe-LDHx also show a similar trend, demonstrating that the concentration of NH3 plays an important role in regulating the catalytic kinetics, active surface area and charge transfer resistance, and that the NH3 concentration of 2.18 wt‰ is optimal for the formation of a high-efficiency HER electrocatalyst.
The OER electrocatalytic activities of NiFe-LDHx and RuO2/NF were measured in O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution with a standard three-electrode system. As shown in Fig. S12,† with the increased concentration of NH3, the OER electrocatalytic performance of the resulting NiFe-LDHx first increases and then deceases, proving that the OER activity of NiFe-LDHx can be facilely regulated by adjusting the concentration of NH3. When the concentration of NH3 is 2.18 wt‰, the resulting NiFe-LDH2.18 shows the highest OER electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 227 mV at 100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5a and S12a†). Moreover, NiFe-LDH2.18 reveals the smallest Tafel slope value of 39.9 mV dec−1 among all NiFe-LDHx catalysts (Fig. S12b†), corresponding to the fastest OER reaction kinetics. The iR-corrected LSV results in Fig. 5b and c exhibit that both NiFe-LDH0 and NiFe-LDH2.18 display much better OER electrocatalytic activities than the commercial RuO2/NF catalyst. Compared with NiFe-LDH0, a little inferior OER catalytic activity of NiFe-LDH2.18 might be attributed to its modulated electronic structure after NH3-inducing, which changes the adsorption energies of OER intermediates on the active sites.14,34,48 However, the excellent OER electrochemical performance of NiFe-LDH2.18 is still superior to those of most of the previously reported transition metal-based bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts (see Fig. S13 and Table S1 for a detailed comparison†).39–42

Inspired by such outstanding HER/OER bifunctional electrocatalytic activities, the overall water splitting performance of NiFe-LDH2.18 was further investigated in 1.0 M KOH solution with a two-electrode system. As shown in Fig. 5d, the NiFe-LDH2.18 catalyst works as both the anode and cathode in the electrolytic cell. During the water splitting process, vigorous H2/O2 bubbles overflow from electrode plates (Video S1†). Impressively, the as-assembled NiFe-LDH2.18‖NiFe-LDH2.18 electrolyzer achieves a robust water splitting electrocatalytic performance with low cell voltages of 1.61, 1.81 and 2.04 V at 10, 200 and 800 mA cm−2, respectively. Compared with NiFe-LDH-based catalysts reported in the literature23,49–51 and the RuO2‖Pt/C couple, lower voltages at the same current densities are obtained for NiFe-LDH2.18 (Fig. 5e). In addition, this electrolyzer assembled using the NiFe-LDH2.18 electrode maintains preeminent water splitting electrochemical activity at a large current density of 200 mA cm−2 after the long-term durability test (Fig. 5f), revealing an excellent operating durability.
Based on the above-mentioned characterization results, the prominent HER/OER bifunctional electrocatalytic performances of the NiFe-LDH2.18 catalyst can be attributed to its modulated electronic state and unique architecture. First, the atomic ratio of Ni and Fe in NiFe-LDH has been changed after the NH3-inducing, which significantly regulates the electronic configuration of NiFe-LDH nanosheets. The modulated electronic structure not only enhances the electrical conductivity of the catalytic material, but also improves the adsorption energies of the intermediates on the active sites, hence directly determining the intrinsic catalytic activity and kinetics of the catalyst.35,36 Second, the hierarchical structure composed of secondary nanosheets could propel the infiltration of electrolyte, expose more accessible active sites, and provide multi-dimensional channels for the fast transfer of substances and the release of H2 and O2 bubbles.52,53 Third, the strong adhesion between the NiFe-LDH2.18 nanosheets and nickel foam substrate not only constructs a highway for the electron transfer between the catalyst and the current collector, but also effectively prevents the undesirable accumulation and migration of active components during the catalytic process, ensuring structural and electrochemical stability.54–56 Therefore, these advantages make the NiFe-LDH2.18 catalyst a promising electrocatalyst for water splitting in alkaline electrolytes.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have remarkably enhanced the HER performance of self-supported NiFe-LDH while retaining its high OER catalytic activity via NH3-inducing at room temperature. The NH3 dissolves in the etchant solution around nickel foam and generates OH−, which accelerates the heterogeneous precipitation of NiFe-LDH. Thereby, NH3-inducing could not only tune the electronic configuration via changing the atomic ratio of Ni and Fe, but also facilitate the construction of a unique geometric structure. NiFe-LDH2.18 shows a hierarchical porous structure and a modulated electronic state, providing more available active sites, more unobstructed channels and faster electron/ion transfer rate for the HER/OER. These advantages endow NiFe-LDH2.18 with significantly improved intrinsic catalytic activity, and structural and electrochemical stability. In an alkaline electrolyte, NiFe-LDH2.18 directly serving as an electrode could reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 95 mV for HER, and reach the current density of 100 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of 227 mV for the OER. Moreover, the assembled water splitting electrolytic cell NiFe-LDH2.18‖NiFe-LDH2.18 has better electrocatalytic water splitting properties than the RuO2‖Pt/C counterpart. The simple and convenient strategy for electronic regulation and architectural design highlighted in this work may provide a prospective guidance for the exploration of cost-effective and high-efficiency catalysts for sustainable-energy conversion.
