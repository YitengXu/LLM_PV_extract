    , Accepted 21st February 2013First published on 21st February 2013AbstractA microporous hydrophobic polyaniline (PANi) integrated poly(hexamethylene diisocyanate tripolymer/polyethylene glycol) [poly(HDT/PEG)] gel electrolyte was successfully synthesized via a two-step aqueous solution polymerization process. An ionic conductivity of 12.11 mS cm−1 at room temperature was obtained for the PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte, which was well characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Morphological observations showed that the resultant gel electrolyte exhibits microporous structure, providing space for holding I−/I3− liquid electrolyte. The integration of PANi with poly(HDT/PEG) causes a lower charge-transfer resistance and higher electrocatalytic activity for the I−/I3− redox reaction. A dye-sensitized solar cell with a photo-to-electric conversion efficiency of 6.81% was obtained by sandwiching PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte between a TiO2 anode and a Pt counter electrode, under illumination with simulated solar light of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5).
1 Introduction
Established in 1991 by O'Regan and Grätzel, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have made rapid progress to date, with overall conversion efficiencies as high as around 13% being reported.1–7 These devices are usually assembled with a liquid electrolyte, but the presence of this liquid component is considered a drawback, especially considering long-term stability and practical use. One alternative to the liquid electrolyte is the use of polymer hole conductors or electrolytes.8–13 Polymer electrolytes have attracted great attention due to their higher conductivity and excellent long-term stability. However, low ionic transport, high charge-transfer resistance as well as limited electrocatalytic activity for the I−/I3− redox reaction and insufficient penetration of the electrolyte into the nanostructured TiO2 photoanode have meant that photovoltaic devices using bare polymer gel electrolytes present lower values of current density and fill factor, and therefore have lower photo-to-electric conversion efficiencies compared to DSSCs assembled with liquid electrolytes.14–16
In order to improve the conversion efficiencies of quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (QS-DSSCs), a modification of the gel electrolyte is a prerequisite. The combination of polymer gel electrolytes with conductive polymers has made them more attractive. Conductive polymers have been employed to construct conductive polymer/TiO2 anodes, counter electrodes and solid electrolytes, and the photovoltaic performances of cells have been significantly improved.17–21 Although many literature reports have shown improvements in DSSC performances by employing conductive polymers,20,21 few have presented the investigation of conductive polymer integrated gel electrolytes.
In the current work, the research sets forth the characterization of polymer gel electrolytes based on the combination of a copolymer of hexamethylene diisocyanate tripolymer (HDT) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), with and without the addition of PANi, and their application in QS-DSSCs.
2 Experimental
Synthesis of poly(HDT/PEG) matrix
Poly(HDT/PEG) polymer was synthesized via the following procedure: a mixture of 2 M HDT and 3 M polyethylene glycol 600 was vigorously agitated for 10–15 min. Subsequently, dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) (mass ratio of DBTDL to HDT was 0.8), an initiator for the polymerization, was added to the mixed solution under a nitrogen atmosphere. With the proceeding of polymerization, the viscosity increased gradually. When the viscosity of the poly(HDT/PEG) prepolymers reached around 180 mPa s−1 (the viscosity of the reagent was measured using a Haaker ReoStress RS75 rheometer at a shear rate of around 100 s−1), the reagent was poured into a Petri dish and cooled to room temperature until an elastic gel was formed. The samples were vacuum dried at 80 °C for more than 48 h.
Preparation of PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte
PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) hybrid polymer was prepared according to the following procedure: 0.1 g of poly(HDT/PEG) was immersed in a predetermined amount of aniline (ANi) monomer and HCl solution (1 ml ANi, 300 ml H2O, pH = 2.5) at ambient temperature for more than 48 h, resulting in the absorption of ANi monomer into the 3D framework of poly(HDT/PEG) polymer and leading to the formation of a swollen gel. Subsequently, the swollen sample was soaked again in 20 ml of a 0.0365 M KPS solution, and the polymerization reaction took place at 4 °C for more than 48 h in dark. When the swollen sample had changed from the original pale yellow color to dark green, the conductive PANi polymer chain had formed by in situ polymerization of ANi inside the poly(HDT/PEG) framework. After the polymerization process, the intermediate sample was filtered, washed and dried to obtain a highly conductive PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) hybrid polymer. A gel electrolyte based on PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) was prepared by soaking 0.2 g of dried PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) polymer in liquid electrolyte for more than 96 h to reach absorption saturation. The liquid electrolyte was composing of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI), 0.1 M tetramethylammonium iodide (TMAI), 0.1 M tetraethylammonium iodide (TEAI), 0.1 M KI, 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M NaI and 0.06 M I2 in a mixed organic solvent of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and acetonitrile (NMP–AC = 2:8).
As a comparison, the gel electrolyte based on bare poly(HDT/PEG) was synthesized under the same conditions.
Assembly of QS-DSSCs
A 10 μm film of TiO2 nanocrystal photoanode film was prepared using a “doctor blade method”, followed by sintering in air at 450 °C for 30 min. The QS-DSSC from poly(HDT/PEG) or PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolytes was fabricated by sandwiching a slice of gel electrolyte between the dye-sensitized TiO2 anode and a Pt counter electrode. The detailed fabrication procedures for the nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode and the assembly of DSSCs have been reported in our previous publications.22
Characterization
The morphologies of the gel electrolytes were captured with a Zeiss Ultra plus field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). To observe the internal 3D microstructure, swollen gel electrolytes were first cut into ultrathin films, followed by loading into a chamber under freezing temperatures and high vacuum to remove any solvent. The phases were identified using a Rigaku MiniFlex II X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at a power of 30 kV and 40 mA. The XRD data were collected in a scan mode with a scanning speed of 10° min−1 in the 2θ range between 5 and 40°. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker). The ionic conductivities of the gel electrolytes were measured using a pocket conductivity meter (HANNA8733, Hanna Instruments). The instrument was calibrated with 0.01 M KCl aqueous solution prior to experiments. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of samples was measured using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode one compartment cell with poly(HDT/PEG) or PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) as the working electrode, Pt foil as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode dipped in an acetonitrile solution of 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also carried out on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation at a constant temperature of 20 °C with an ac signal amplitude of 20 mV in the frequency range from 0.1 to 105 Hz at 0 V dc bias in the dark.
3 Results and discussion
Synthesis and liquid electrolyte loading
The mixing of HDT and PEG resulted in the combination of HDT and PEG via H-bonding between >CO and –OH groups (step 1 in Fig. 1). Under the initiation of DBTDL, HDT/PEG complex monomers would form poly(HDT/PEG), which is shown in the 2nd step of Fig. 1. The physical entanglement as well as chemical bonding results in the formation of a 3D microporous structure. The integration of hydrophilic –OH groups in PEG and CO groups in poly(hexamethylene diisocyanate) tripolymer, leads to the loss of hydrophilicity of PEG.23 The absorption of the liquid electrolyte by the resultant poly(HDT/PEG) is powerful evidence of hydrophobicity.

The extraordinary 3D framework and strong absorption drive the diffusion of ANi monomer into 3D poly(HDT/PEG). The in situ polymerization of ANi to PANi in the presence of KPS solution forms a highly conductive PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte because of the electrical nature of emeraldine PANi.24,25 To upload I−/I3− redox couples, the resultant poly(HDT/PEG) or PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) hybrid polymers were immersed into the liquid electrolyte until their absorption equilibrium was reached. The absorption of liquid electrolyte into poly(HDT/PEG) or PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) framework is primarily driven by the osmotic pressure present across the membrane, along with stretching of molecular chains and considerable expansion in volume.26 Generally, the loaded liquid electrolyte in poly(HDT/PEG) or PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) matrix can be divided into two states: (1) the electrolyte molecules close to poly(HDT/PEG) or PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) framework backbones form H-bonds with –OH and NC groups, whereas the electrolyte molecules away from the framework backbones are free. The bonded liquid electrolyte beneficial to the improvement of long-term stability and the free electrolyte contributes to increased ionic conductivity. The interconnective 3D framework provides space for the transport of I−/I3− redox couples, leading to a similar conduction mechanism and ionic conductivity to that of liquid system. More importantly, the absorbed liquid electrolyte cannot leak from the 3D framework even under pressure or after long-term application.
Morphology observation
To reveal the interconnected porous microstructure of the PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) framework, a freeze-drying technique was employed and cross-sectional SEM photographs are shown in Fig. 2a. It is evident that the resultant PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) is indeed a well-interconnected, interpenetrating network, capable of caging a large quantity of liquid electrolyte in the microporous structure. At high magnification in Fig. 2b, the in situ polymerized PANi spread onto the interior and external surfaces forms an additional channel for enhanced ionic conduction. The observed 3D framework along with unique absorption and excellent retention illustrates the feasibility of employing hydrophobic hydrogel materials as liquid electrolyte supporter.

Structural analysis
Infrared spectroscopy is a useful technique for characterizing structures of materials. From the micro-transformations in FTIR spectra, we can detect the changes in structures and analyze potential mechanisms. The FTIR spectra of poly(HDT/PEG) and PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) are shown in Fig. 3, where the absorption bands at 3506, 1678 and 1103, 1248, 1355, 1459, and 761 cm−1 in the pure poly(HDT/PEG) originate from the vibrations of O–H stretching, CO stretching, C–O–C stretching, C–N stretching, OC–O stretching, OC–O stretching, CH2 scissoring, and OC–O stretching vibrations, respectively. The detection of absorption bands at 1103 (C–O–C stretching) and 1355 (OC–O stretching) cm−1 indicated the polymerization of HDT/PEG complex monomers to poly(HDT/PEG). Two bands attributed to the CC stretching deformation of quinoid and benzene rings are detected at 1557 and 1467 cm−1, respectively.27,28 All the bands could be detected in PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG). The change in position of the absorption bands is a sign of H-bond formation between PANi and poly(HDT/PEG). The bands from the CC stretching deformation mode of quinoid and benzenoid rings have shifted to 1509 and 1410 cm−1 in the PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) because of physical and chemical interactions, indicating the combination of poly(HDT/PEG) and PANi. The band at 1110 cm−1 is believed to be a characteristic peak related to acid doping. Doping of PANi with HCl results in the formation of the emeraldine base of PANi, giving increased electrical and electrochemical performances.

The XRD patterns of poly(HDT/PEG) and PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) are shown in Fig. 4a. At first glance, the two kinds of polymers are both amorphous. However, a close examination reveals four peaks in the low angle region 2θ = 8.2, 20.7, 21.2, and 24.9°, which could also be detected in the XRD pattern of pure PANi (Fig. 4b).27,28 The peaks at 2θ = 20.7 and 24.9° are usually related to the periodicity parallel and perpendicular to the polymer chain, respectively. The peaks at 24.9° could be due to periodicity caused by π–π stacking of rigid phenazine-like structures. The detection of diffraction peaks at 2θ = 8.2, 20.7, 21.2, and 24.9° indicate a highly ordered molecular structure of PANi. All these results confirm that the combined PANi was in a highly crystalline emeraldine salt state, which is expected to enhance the electrical and electrochemical performances of the quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte.

Electrical and electrochemical performances
The lnσ versus 1/T plots for the poly(HDT/PEG) and PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolytes are shown in Fig. 5. In both polymer gel electrolytes, ionic conductivities increased with the elevation in temperature, giving a linear dependence of ionic conductivity on temperature. The results are consistent with those in isotropic ionic liquids.29 Therefore, the Arrhenius equation (eqn (1)) can be used to describe the conductivity–temperature behaviors of the gel electrolytes.30 (1)where Ea is the activation energy, R is the molar gas constant, A is a constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The Ea values for poly(HDT/PEG) and PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolytes were calculated by plotting the linear fitting, and were found to be 9.39 kJ mol−1 and 10.06 kJ mol−1, respectively. The low Ea values are indicative of the similar ionic conduction mechanism and free-volume of the poly(HDT/PEG) and PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) systems. It is noteworthy to mention that the highest ionic conductivity was 12.11 mS cm−1 for PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG), which was higher than that for bare poly(HDT/PEG), indicating that the integration of PANi was beneficial to improve the transport kinetics of ions.

As a powerful tool to explore the electrochemical process, EIS has been widely employed in testing the electrocatalytic activity for the regeneration of a redox couple. For EIS experiments, the Pt/gel electrolyte/Pt was contained in an asymmetric sandwich cell composed of a gel electrolyte sandwiched by two FTO supported Pt glass electrodes. Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist plots of Pt/gel electrolyte/Pt devices using the two electrolytes. Typically, the intercept on the real axis (high frequency) can be attributed to the series resistance (Rs). The first semi-circle (middle frequency) can be assigned to the resistance capacitance networks of the electrode/electrolyte interface, including the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding capacitance (Cdl). The second semi-circle (low frequency) can be assigned to the diffusion impedance (ZW) of the redox couple (I−/I3−) in the electrolyte.

The EIS curves are shown in Fig. 6 and the data are summarized in Table 1. In the current research, the Rct values of PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) and poly(HDT/PEG) are 9.2 and 12.91 Ω cm−2, respectively. A lower Rct was observed for the PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte in comparison with that of the bare poly(HDT/PEG), showing an increase in electrocatalytic behavior towards the I−/I3− redox reaction. Moreover, higher electrical conductivity and better contact, corresponding to a slower diffusion velocity of the I−/I3− redox species in the electrolyte,31 were also found for the PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte. The microporous structure of PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) is favorable to the penetration of the I−/I3− redox species and therefore benefits the overall photovoltaic performance of the QS-DSSC.

Cyclic voltammetry was carried out in a N2-purged AC solution with an aim of revealing the accelerated electrocatalytic effect of PANi on the I−/I3− redox reaction. The poly(HDT/PEG) or PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte was employed as working electrode, Pt foil as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M LiClO4 and the redox couple was 10 mM LiI and 1 mM I2.

Fig. 7 compared the cyclic voltammograms of the I−/I3− system for poly(HDT/PEG) and PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolytes at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The cathodic reaction was assigned to the reduction reaction from I3− to I−, however, the anodic oxidation reaction from I− to I3−occurred:32,33I3− + 2e− = 3I− (cathodic)3I− − 2e− = I3− (anodic)

No redox reaction was observed for poly(HDT/PEG) electrolyte because of the lack of electrocatalytic behavior. PANi is a typical conducting polymer which has been widely used as a counter electrode in DSSCs.19 One of the highlighted performances of PANi is their redox behaviors, i.e. electrocatalysis. The redox reaction between I− and I3− can be significantly enhanced by integrating PANi into poly(HDT/PEG).
In a real DSSC, electrons are injected into a photooxidized dye from I− ions in electrolyte, and the produced I3− ions are reduced on the counter electrode. Fig. 7 shows a much higher current density of the I3− reduction peak for the PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte than that for the poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte, suggesting a faster reaction rate and superior electrochemical activity on the PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte. These results are in good agreement with those of electrical behavior and EIS analysis.
Photovoltaic performances
The J–V curves of the QS-DSSCs are presented in Fig. 8, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. On the account of the low Rct value, the QS-DSSCs using PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 6.81%, giving a high Jsc of 14.22 mA cm−2 and a large FF of 0.70. The photovoltaic performances were better than those reported by Lee et al.34 but similar to our previous reports.12,29 In contrast, the DSSC using the poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte presented a relatively low η of 6.37%, Jsc of 13.91 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.69. The significantly enhanced photovoltaic behaviors are attributed to the promoting effect of emeraldine PANi.

4 Conclusions
In summary, conductive PANi was employed to combine with hydrophobic poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte to fabricate an interconnective 3D framework. The unique microporous structure, extraordinary absorption and reasonable retention resulted in good I−/I3− loading and sealing. The resultant PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte showed significantly enhanced ionic conductivity, transport kinetics and electrocatalytic activity for the I−/I3− redox couple. A QS-DSSC prepared using the PANi integrated poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte yielded a reasonable conversion efficiency of 6.81%, which was higher than 6.37% from the QS-DSSC using a poly(HDT/PEG) gel electrolyte. This research opens a gateway to improve the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs and highlighted the competitive capacity of the QS-DSSCs among photovoltaic devices.
