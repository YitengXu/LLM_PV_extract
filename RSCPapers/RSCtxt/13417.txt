    , Accepted 25th May 2017First published on 26th May 2017AbstractIn this study, we report on the synthesis of thermoresponsive polymers with different microstructures, a precisely tunable lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and terminal catechol anchors by copper(0) mediated living radical polymerization (Cu(0)-LRP). All the Cu(0)-LRP polymerizations were performed directly from the unprotected dopamine-functionalized initiators at ambient temperature or below in aqueous solution with full or close to full conversion obtained in minutes. The resulting polymers exhibited a designed molecular weight (MW), narrow MW distribution and high end-group fidelity capable of in situ block copolymerization. We demonstrate their application toward the surface modification of titanium dioxide nanoparticles by the successful preparation of smart nanocomposites with a self-flocculation effect. A “one-pot” strategy was then developed for the simultaneous polymerization and surface modification to simplify the multi-step purification and immobilization processes. The subsequent degradation of Rhodamine B under the irradiation of simulated solar light proved the potential application of hybrid nanocomposites in water treatment and a switching effect of photocatalytic ability below or above the LCST was also observed.
Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are leading semiconductor materials with widespread use in the photocatalytic and photovoltaic field as well as for water splitting applications.1–3 Due to the excellent physicochemical properties and photoinduced activities, their uses in organic pollutant removal and microbial control in water are under increasingly intense development.4–7 One crucial point for the application in water purification and disinfection is the ability to control the state of dispersion and aggregation of the nanoparticles, which is important to avoid the agglomeration of nanoparticles and secondary pollution caused by the unrecovered TiO2. Stimuli-responsive smart polymer surfaces that are capable of conformational and chemical changes on receiving external stimuli, including the temperature, pH, ionic strength and solvent, etc., have been introduced in TiO2 nanocomposites for better dispersity, desired self-flocculation effect and controlled photocurrent behaviours.8–11
Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (poly(NIPAM)) has been one of the most widely investigated thermoresponsive polymers, which exhibits a LCST of around 32 °C in water.12–15 Poly(NIPAM) has also been synthesized with terminal anchors for the modification of iron oxide and silica nanoparticles by both “grafting to” and “grafting from” methods in order to reversibly manipulate the solubility of nanoparticles.9,14–16 However, poly(NIPAM) has been proved to induce cellular cytotoxicity and the degraded monomer could cause even more serious cell damage.17,18 Alternatively, the random copolymerization of two oligo(ethylene glycol) macromonomers with different chain-lengths could lead to the formation of nontoxic thermo-responsive copolymers with a tunable LCST.13,19–22 Such polymers have potential application in preparing self-cleaning or switching surfaces which respond to several external stimuli.23–25
Strongly binding anchor groups inspired by nature, such as high affinity dopamine and nitrocatechols, have been considered to play a crucial role in immobilizing polymers reversibly or irreversibly onto the surface, which can prevent nanoparticle agglomeration under diluting and heating conditions.15,26,27 However, due to the side effects caused by catechol groups, multistep organic reactions had to be utilized for the “post-polymerization modification” strategy and the degree of functionality was far from quantitative (only ∼60–70%).15,28 Living/controlled radical polymerizations are attractive strategies to directly synthesize catechol-terminal polymers from catechol-functionalized initiators or chain transfer agents. Typically, reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization has shown good tolerance to the radical scavenging effect caused by the catechol group and excellent control during polymerization has led to the successful synthesis of various well-defined catechol polymers.29–33 Due to the highly stable coordination of catechol groups with transition metal ions, atom transfer radical polymerization using even the protected catechol-functionalized initiators showed relatively poor control over the polymer's MW and MW distribution.34–38 Cu(0)-LRP has been well-known for its application in the ultrafast synthesis of vinyl polymers with an ultrahigh molecular weight, complex macromolecular architecture and excellent control of MW evolution and distribution.39–46 Rapid developments in Cu(0)-LRP have revolutionized the way to perform polymerization under aqueous and competitive reaction conditions; especially the tolerance to protonic solvents and polar functional groups such as hydroxyl, amine and catechol groups etc. has enabled the successful synthesis of water-soluble catechol polymers as well as important protein/peptide–polymer conjugates.27,47–52
In this present work, a series of thermoresponsive polymers with different microstructures, a precisely tunable LCST and terminal catechol anchors have been successfully synthesized by Cu(0)-LRP with a fast reaction rate and full or close to full conversion in aqueous solution. The subsequent surface modification of TiO2 nanoparticles via the “grafting to” strategy leads to smart nanocomposites with a self-flocculation effect and controlled photocatalytic activity. A “one-pot” strategy was also developed for simultaneous polymerization and surface modification to simplify the multi-step purification and immobilization processes. Such smart hybrid nanocomposites could be prepared on a large scale and efficiently recovered after use, which are potentially useful for photocatalytic water treatment.
Experimental
Materials
Di(ethylene glycol) ethyl ether acrylate (DEGEEA, ≥90%, Aladdin) and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGA480, average Mn 480, Aladdin) were de-inhibited by passing through a column of basic alumina prior to use. The dopamine-based initiator 2-bromo-N-(3,4-dihydro-xyphenethyl)-2-methylpropanamide (DOPA-Br) and tris(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)amine (Me6TREN) were synthesized according to a literature procedure and stored in a freezer under a nitrogen atmosphere.27,53,54 Copper(I) bromide (CuBr, 98%, Aladdin) was washed sequentially with acetic acid and ethanol and dried under vacuum. Titanium dioxide (anatase 99.8% metal basis, average particle size: 25 nm, Aladdin) was dried in a vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h before use. Membrane dialysis (1 K MWCO) was obtained from Spectrum Laboratories. All other reagents and solvents were obtained at the highest purity available from Aladdin (China) and used without further purification unless otherwise stated.
Analytical techniques

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a Bruker AV 500 M spectrometer using deuterated solvents obtained from Aladdin. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and the molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) were determined by Waters 1515 size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in N,N-dimethylbenzamide (DMF) at 40 °C with a flow rate of 1.00 mL min−1. The SEC was equipped with refractive index (RI) and UV detectors, a 20 μm guard column (4.6 mm × 30 mm, 100–10 K) followed by three Waters Styragel columns (HR1, HR3 & HR4) and an autosampler. Narrow linear polystyrene standards in the range of 540 to 7.4 × 105 g mol−1 were used to calibrate the system. All samples were passed through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter before analysis. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet iS5 FTIR spectrometer using an iD7 diamond attenuated total reflectance optical base. Transition electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired by using an FEI TECNAI G2 20 TEM microscope equipped with a LaB6 filament. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) was performed at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 800 °C under nitrogen protection. The turbidity of the nanoparticles was detected by using a WGZ-2000 turbidity meter (Beijing Warwick Industrial Science and technology, P.R. China). The size and size distribution of the TiO2 particles were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a ZetaPALS variable temperature analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments, UK). The optical transmittance of the aqueous solution of thermo-responsive polymers at a wavelength of 500 nm was acquired on a SHIMADZU UV-2600 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. A thermostatically controlled cuvette was employed and the heating rate was 1 °C min−1. The LCST was defined as the temperatures corresponding to 1% decreases of transmittance.
Synthesis of dopamine-terminal thermoresponsive polymers
The Cu(0)-LRP was performed using the standard Schlenk technique under nitrogen protection. To a Schlenk tube fitted with a magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum, H2O (2 mL) and Me6TREN (26 μL, 0.1 mmol) were charged and the mixture was bubbled with nitrogen for 5 min. CuBr (14 mg, 0.1 mmol) was then carefully added under a slight positive pressure of nitrogen. The nitrogen bubbling continued for a further 10 min and subsequently the blue suspension with purple red coloured Cu(0) powder was allowed to stir under ice/water bath to cool. At the same time, to another reaction tube fitted with a magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum, H2O (2 mL), i-PrOH (2 mL), DOPA-Br (75 mg, 0.25 mmol) and DEGEEA (1890 mg, 10 mmol) were charged and the mixture was bubbled with nitrogen for 15 min. After that, the degassed monomer/initiator aqueous solution was transferred via a cannula to the Schlenk tube containing the Cu(0)/CuBr2/Me6TREN catalyst. The Schlenk tube was sealed and the mixed solution was allowed to polymerize at 0 °C. The sample of the reaction mixture was then removed in a defined reaction period for analysis. The sample for 1H NMR analysis was directly diluted with D2O and catalyst residues were removed by filtering through a column of neutral alumina prior to DMF SEC analysis. The residual polymer product was purified via dialysis against water for two days and then recovered by lyophilization.
For the random copolymerization, mixtures of DEGEEA and PEGA480 with a defined ratio were polymerized for 24 h until full or close to full conversion (96–99%) was obtained.
For the synthesis of poly(DEGEEA)-b-(PEGA480), the polymerization procedure is the same as previously described. After the polymerization of DEGEEA for 1.5 h, sampling for 1H NMR analysis showed that the conversion reached 97%. A degassed aqueous solution of PEGA480 was directly added to the reaction tube to polymerize for another 12 h.
Preparation of TiO2/polymer hybrid nanocomposites via the “grafting to” strategy
TiO2 nanoparticles (40 mg) and dopamine-terminal polymers (120 mg) were dispersed into deionized water to produce a homogeneous suspension and stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere at 4 °C for two days. Particles were isolated by centrifugation at 15000 rpm for 15 min. After discarding the supernatant, the sediments were dispersed in deionized water and centrifuged once more. The above purification cycle was repeated five times to remove the excess thermo-responsive polymers. Finally, the product was freeze-dried for further characterization.
One-pot preparation of TiO2/polymer hybrid nanocomposites
The preparation of the catalyst suspension (H2O, 2 mL; Me6TREN, 26 μL, 0.1 mmol; CuBr, 14 mg, 0.1 mmol) was the same as previously described. To the second tube, H2O (2 mL), i-PrOH (2 mL), DOPA-Br (75 mg, 0.25 mmol), DEGEEA (940 mg, 5 mmol) and PEGA480 (420 mg, 0.9 mmol) were charged and the mixture was bubbled with nitrogen for 15 min. To the third tube, H2O (1 mL), i-PrOH (1 mL) and TiO2 (300 mg, 3.8 mmol) were charged and the mixture was also bubbled with nitrogen for 15 min. After that, the degassed monomer/initiator aqueous solution and TiO2 suspension were simultaneously transferred via a cannula to the Schlenk tube containing the Cu(0)/CuBr2/Me6TREN catalyst. The Schlenk tube was sealed and the mixed solution was allowed to polymerize at 0 °C for 12 h. After reaction, the sample was taken for NMR characterization and the TiO2/polymer nanocomposites were isolated by centrifugation at 15000 rpm for 15 min. After collecting the supernatant, the sediments were dispersed in deionized water and centrifuged once more. The above purification cycle was repeated five times to remove the excess polymers. Finally, the nanocomposites and free polymer products were freeze-dried for further characterization.
Degradation of Rhodamine B solution catalysed by TiO2 nanocomposites under simulated sunlight or UV irradiation
The degradation of Rhodamine B aqueous solution (Rhod B, 20 mL, 10 mg L−1, pH = 7.0) under simulated sunlight or UV irradiation in the presence of TiO2 nanocomposites (10 mg) at different temperatures was studied based on the degradation ratio (D, %) calculated by the concentration decrease of Rhod B before and after the photocatalytic degradation. The concentration of Rhod B was detected by using an UV/Vis spectrometer and all samples were filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE filter before analysis. The simulated sun light (λ = 350–780 nm) was supplied by using a 300 W xenon lamp (CEL-HXF 300, Beijing CEAULIGHT Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) equipped with a Vis-REF reflect patch. A piece of the UV-REF reflect patch was employed for UV photocatalysis (λ = 200–400 nm) to remove visible light with wavelengths above 400 nm. The distance between the light source and the Rhod B solution was maintained at 20 cm and magnetic stirring was utilized to make sufficient contact of Rhod B with the nanocomposites. The output power of the xenon lamp at the visible light (λ = 390–770 nm) and UV (λ < 390 nm) ranges, according to the instrument's specification, was 5000 Lu and 2.6 W, respectively.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of dopamine-terminal polymers with tunable lower critical solution temperatures
Herein an unprotected dopamine-functional initiator, 2-bromo-N-(3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)-2-methylpropanamide (DOPA-Br), was directly used for the Cu(0)-LRP of DEGEEA in an isopropyl alcohol (i-PrOH)/water mixture under ice/water to cool (Scheme 1).

A prior disproportionation strategy was utilized to generate active catalysts (Cu(0)/CuBr2/Me6TREN) to overcome the radical scavenging and metal coordination effect caused by the unprotected catechol groups.27 The Cu(0)-LRP of DEGEEA was shown to be fast even at 0 °C with the monomer conversion reaching 90% in 15 minutes and over 97% after half an hour (Fig. 1A). SEC characterization revealed a symmetric elution trace and the dispersity of the final poly(DEGEEA) was as low as 1.10 even at full conversion, Fig. 2A. A small shoulder peak in the high MW region was observed and it was mainly attributed to the presence of trace amounts of diacrylates in the monomers rather than the side termination reactions such as the radical–radical coupling etc., which would generally lead to multi-modal and unsymmetrical peaks.

1H and 13C NMR spectra of the final product displayed characteristic resonances at 6.4–7.0 ppm (for Hj, HL and Hm) and 115–145 ppm (for Cj, Ck, CL, Cm, Cn and Co), respectively, Fig. 1B, which clearly proved the presence of a terminal catechol unit. The average MW calculated by comparing the integration of protons from the catechol groups with that from the polymer backbones was 9300 g mol−1, which was almost 20% higher than the theoretical MW (7800 g mol−1). The considerable difference in the experimental and theoretical MW has also been observed in the previous reports and was attributed to possible termination at low chain length when using amide functional initiators.27,55
Typical LCST behavior was observed for the aqueous solution of poly(DEGEEA) homo-polymer as revealed by the temperature-dependent transmittance at a wavelength of 500 nm, Fig. 3A. We can clearly see that the transmittance starts to decrease sharply above 9 °C, indicating the occurrence of interchain aggregation and scattering of the incident light. It is well known that copolymerization of oligo(ethylene glycol) macromonomers of different chain-lengths could lead to the formation of thermo-responsive polymers with a tunable LCST.13 In this context, poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGA480, average Mn 480), a more hydrophilic monomer but bearing a similar chemical structure to DEGEEA, was used for copolymerization in order to tune the LCST of thermo-responsive polymers. The DP of DEGEEA was set at 40 and varied amounts of PEGA480 were added as the co-monomer with a gradual increase of molar fraction of [PEGA480]/[DEGEEA] (Rco) from 0.06 to 0.24. All of the polymerizations were conducted until full or close to full conversion (96–98%, Fig. 2A) was obtained so that the composition in the final polymer product could be the same as the monomer feed ratio. SEC characterization exhibited an increase of Mn from 20600 to 26300 g mol−1 when more PEGA480 was polymerized; however, the MW distributions were all narrow with the Mw/Mn as low as 1.14–1.15 even including the shoulder peak caused by the trace amounts of diacrylate crosslinking agents in the monomers. As shown in Fig. S1,† the 1H NMR spectrum of random copolymers confirmed the resonance from the oligo(ethylene glycol) groups at 3.4–3.8 ppm and terminal catechol groups at 6.4–6.9 ppm, which proved the successful synthesis of random copolymers with a defined functional anchor group. In comparison, the random copolymers poly(DEGEEA)-r-(PEGA480) exhibit higher a LCST than the homo-polymer poly(DEGEEA), which increased from 8.7 °C to a relatively high temperature of 40.8 °C, Fig. 3A.
 Fig. 3  Temperature dependence of the optical transmittance at 500 nm obtained for 1 mg mL−1 aqueous solutions of thermoresponsive polymers (A, the LCST was defined as the temperature corresponding to 1% decrease of transmittance) and the fitted cure between the LCST and molar fraction of PEGA480 to DEGEEA (B). 
It is also worth noting that the sharp transition of transmittance became broader when more PEGA480 was copolymerized, suggesting that the incorporation of longer and more hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) chains would significantly affect the thermal phase transition behavior of thermo-responsive polymers. When counting the change of LCST with the molar fraction of co-monomers (Rco) as shown in Fig. 3B (the black solid point), an equation could be calculated based on the fitted curve: LCST = 200.39Rco2 + 185.93Rco + 8.27. To verify the equation's accuracy, three more copolymerizations with Rco = 0.09, 0.15 and 0.21 were then conducted and SEC characterization confirmed the synthesis of well-defined polymers (Fig. S2†). The LCST values of these copolymers were 23.1, 31.0 and 38.0 °C, respectively (Fig. S3†), which was in agreement with the theoretical value (23.4, 31.6 & 38.5) as the relative hollow dots in Fig. 3B are all very close to the fitted curve. It was observed that the LCST strongly depends on the concentration and the transmittance−temperature curves were shifted to lower temperature regimes with increasing polymer concentration (Fig. S4†). As shown in Fig. S5,† full transmittance recovery occurred during the repeated heating/cooling cycles and no significant hysteresis was observed, which indicated a stable and repeatable thermal phase transition behaviour.
Cu(0)-LRP has introduced a facile approach to the synthesis of multiblock copolymers without the need for purification between block forming steps.56,57 To verify the end-group fidelity of poly(DEGEEA) by Cu(0)-LRP, a degassed PEGA480 aqueous solution was directly added to the reaction tube after a very high conversion (97%) of DEGEEA was obtained for a one-pot block copolymerization. As shown in Fig. 2B, SEC characterization revealed a clear and total MW shift after block copolymerization and a final dispersity of 1.20, which further proved the “living” nature of Cu(0)-LRP. The 1H NMR spectrum of the block copolymer (Fig. S6†) revealed the presence of the characteristic signals of catechol groups and an actual Rco at ∼0.12. However, the transmittance of the block copolymer solution starts to decrease above 16.0 °C rather than 27.3 °C of a random copolymer with a similar Rco value and it is also worth noting that there tended to be a multi-step thermal phase transition until ∼80 °C, Fig. S7,† which indicated the special thermal phase transition behavior caused by the block microstructure. It is hypothesized that the interchain aggregation of DEGEEA formed a hydrophobic chain fragment and subsequently led to self-assembly due to the presence of the hydrophilic poly(PEGA480) fragment. With the increase of temperature, aggregates between the assemblies could develop and caused a further decrease of transmittance.
Nevertheless, well-defined thermoresponsive polymers with a bio-inspired anchor group could be facilely synthesized by Cu(0)-LRP from an unprotected dopamine functionalized initiator. The polymerization could go to full conversion and block copolymerization was performed in situ without the need for purification. The LCST of polymers could be tuned from ∼9 °C to ∼41 °C by changing the monomer ratio during copolymerization.
Surface functionalization of TiO2 nanoparticles using dopamine-terminal polymers
The thermoresponsive polymers were then used to fabricate the nanoparticles via the strong catechol bonding with TiO2. After immobilization, the polymer-coated TiO2 nanoparticles were separated from the unbounded polymers via repeated separation and re-dispersion using a high-speed centrifuge. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, TEM images revealed the presence of a thin and dense polymer layer (∼5 nm) on the surface of particles after modification, which clearly proved that the bonding of the dopamine-terminal polymer to TiO2 was efficient and successful. A part of the functionalized nanoparticles was separated and lyophilized for characterization using FTIR and TGA. As expected, FTIR spectra (Fig. 4C) showed clear evidence of the polymer's presence on the particle's surface and typical absorption peaks such as the carbonyl stretching at ∼1750 cm−1 and the –CH2–CH2–O (from the block copolymer) stretching at ∼1250 & 2920 cm−1 could be detected, indicating the success of functionalization. Although the “grafting to” strategy was generally considered to have low efficiency in immobilizing polymers onto the surface due to the steric hindrance effect, TGA analysis (Fig. 4D) of polymer-coated particles showed much higher weight loss compared with the original TiO2 particles.
 Fig. 4  TEM images of TiO2 particles (A) and TiO2@poly(DEGEEA)-r-(PEGA480) (B, Rco = 0.06); FTIR (C) and TGA (D) of TiO2 and TiO2 coated with thermal-responsive polymers (a, TiO2 particles; b, TiO2@P(DEGEEA); c & d, TiO2@Poly(DEGEEA)-r-(PEGA480), Rco = 0.06 & 0.12, respectively). 
Interestingly, particles coated with the random copolymers showed a bit higher weight loss during the TGA test, probably due to the higher MW and better solubility of copolymers compared with the homo-polymer.
To avoid the polymer purification procedures of the “grafting to” modification of nanoparticles, a “one-pot” strategy was then investigated. TiO2 nanoparticles were directly added to the reaction tube at the beginning of polymerization and we hypothesize that the polymer could be immobilized onto the surface of nanoparticles through both “grafting to” and “grafting from” strategies. The polymerization retained a fast rate and sampling after two hours showed that the conversion was higher than 99% (Fig. S8†). After reaction, characterization of the separated nanocomposites showed the presence of the polymer on the surface by FTIR characterization (Fig. S9A†) and TGA analysis (Fig. S9B†) exhibited a higher weight loss of ∼51% probably due to the higher immobilization efficiency of the “grafting from” strategy. Interestingly, SEC characterization of the unbounded polymer in the supernatant showed the presence of a small polymer peak in the very high MW region (Fig. S10,†Mn = 413500 g mol−1, Mw/Mn = 1.11). This phenomenon has been observed in previous reports of SET-LRP when excess Cu activators were utilized.58 We believe that the immobilization of the dopamine-functionalized initiator onto the surface of TiO2 will decrease the concentration of free initiators in the solution and make the amount of Cu(0) catalyst relatively higher than theoretically designed, resulting in rapid and uncontrolled polymerization.
In summary, the surfaces of TiO2 nanoparticles have been successfully functionalized with thermo-responsive polymers via strong catechol bonding and the facile “one-pot” strategy allows the preparation of hybrid nanocomposites in a manner that is amenable for the scale-up preparation.
Self-flocculation effect and photocatalytic activity of TiO2 hybrid nanocomposites
Due to the presence of highly water-soluble polymers on the surface after immobilization, the polymer-coated nanoparticles are readily dispersible in water below their respective LCST. As shown in Fig. 5A, TiO2 gradually flocculated as a function of time but some particles remained well dispersed in water even at relatively high temperature. When the hybrid nanocomposites were heated to a temperature above the LCST of the relative copolymers, the hydrophilic surface became hydrophobic and inter-chain interactions between particles caused the nanocomposites to aggregate leading to particles of larger size, thus causing a self-flocculation effect and precipitation at the bottom of the vessel.

The turbidity (C) of TiO2, TiO2@poly(PEGA480) and TiO2@poly(DEGEEA)-r-(PEGA480) (Rco = 0.12) nanocomposites in aqueous solution (1 mg mL−1) at 25 °C. 
As shown in Fig. 5A(a–c), the lower the polymer's LCST is the faster the nanocomposites will settle down with the increase of temperature. Due to the presence of the self-flocculation effect, the hybrid nanocomposites tend to settle down more distinctly than naked TiO2, which is very important to avoid the secondary pollution to the environment. Interestingly, the nanocomposites coated with poly(DEGEEA)-b-(PEGA480) exhibited partial aggregation with the increase of temperature but could still suspend very well compared with TiO2 or the other nanocomposites, possibly due to the broad thermal phase transition of the block copolymer until ∼80 °C.
The change of the hydrodynamic diameter of the TiO2/LCST polymer hybrid nanocomposite with temperature was investigated. As shown in Fig. 5B, the diameters did not change much when the temperature was below 27 °C. However, when the temperature was above 29 °C, the diameters decreased sharply from 420 nm to 260 nm, indicating the shrinking of immobilized polymers around the surface of TiO2 due to the thermal phase transition above the LCST.
The dispersion behaviors of 1 mg mL−1 TiO2, TiO2@poly(PEGA480) and TiO2@poly(DEGEEA)-r-(PEGA480) at ambient temperature were characterized and are illustrated in Fig. 5C. The turbidity of TiO2 was the highest but decreased so fast that more than 90% of the nanoparticles would precipitate in 120 minutes. Due to the excellent water-solubility induced by poly(PEGA480), TiO2@poly(PEGA480) showed a stable state in water and the decline of turbidity was not evident during the tested period. Poly(DEGEEA)-r-(PEGA480) exhibited an LCST (27.3 °C) close to the ambient temperature and the turbidity decline of hybrids coated with this random copolymer was a bit higher than that of TiO2@poly(PEGA480) but much slower than unmodified TiO2. It is hypothesized that the good dispersion property induced by the hydrophilic polymer layer would make the nanoparticles suspend well rather than settling down in the water, thus having higher chance to be exposed to sunlight.
The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 hybrid nanocomposites was evaluated through the degradation of Rhod B under simulated sunlight or UV irradiation. In the first approach, TiO2@poly(DEGEEA)-r-(PEGA480) (Rco = 0.12) was used for the photocatalytic degradation of Rhod B at different temperatures under irradiation of simulated sunlight (λ = 350–780 nm). When the temperature was below the LCST (27.3 °C) of the copolymer, the degradation ratio after 150 minutes could reach 91% (Fig. 6A) and it was only a bit lower than 99% of the unmodified TiO2, which confirmed the retention of catalytic ability even after being covered with a dense polymer layer. In view of the fact that the hybrid nanocomposites were covered with a polymer layer with a weight ratio of 33% (Fig. 4D), the photocatalytic activity of TiO2@poly(DEGEEA)-r-(PEGA480) was higher than that of the raw TiO2, which was possibly due to the better dispersion property of polymer-coated nanoparticles. When the temperature was above the LCST of the copolymer, the catalytic ability significantly declined and the degradation ratio after 150 minutes was 51% under neutral conditions, only slightly higher than the controlled/blank trial (35%). It's hypothesized that the active sites of TiO2 could be covered to prevent exposure to sunlight when the polymer shrank around the surface.
 Fig. 6  Degradation of Rhod B (10 mg L−1) in the presence of TiO2 and TiO2@poly(DEGEEA)-r-(PEGA480) nanocomposites (Rco = 0.12) at different temperatures under the irradiation of simulated sunlight (A) or UV irradiation (B). The concentration of both TiO2 and TiO2@poly(DEGEEA)-r-(PEGA480) in the solution is 0.5 mg mL−1. 
This further proved the presence of the self-flocculation effect and indicated that the photocatalytic ability could be switched between “on” and “off” with the change of temperature. In the natural environment, the temperature of water would rise when exposed to the radiation of sunlight. As shown in Scheme 2, the photodegradation of pollutants will sustain until the temperature increases to a value above the LCST and subsequently the self-flocculation effect will lead to aggregation, precipitation and recovery of the nanocomposites. Since the LCST of the polymer for surface functionalization could be tuned precisely by changing the monomer fraction, it is possible that we can design and prepare a series of smart nanocomposites suitable for different temperatures according to the weather forecast.
 Scheme 2  Schematic representation of the temperature induced flocculation and the controlled photocatalytic switching effect of TiO2/smart polymer hybrid nanocomposites. 
When exposed to the UV irradiation (λ = 200–400 nm), polymer-coated particles also showed similar catalytic performance compared with the raw TiO2 (Fig. 6B) and a significant switching effect of the photocatalytic ability below and above the LCST. Interestingly, the degradation rate tends to be slower than that under the sunlight irradiation, possibly due to the difference in the power intensity of the utilized light source.
Conclusions
In conclusion, Cu(0)-LRP was successfully applied to obtain well-defined thermoresponsive polymers with designed microstructures, tunable LCST and terminal catechol anchor groups. The polymerizations were conducted in aqueous solution without the use of tedious protection–deprotection chemistry or complex post-polymerization modification. Successful in situ block copolymerization and a range of random copolymers with controlled MW and narrow MW distributions verified the characteristic features of living/controlled radical polymerization. The grafting of dopamine end-functionalized polymers onto TiO2 nanoparticles was confirmed by FTIR, TGA, TEM and DLS investigations. The facile “one-pot” strategy proved the tolerance of Cu(0)-LRP to the presence of TiO2 and simplified the polymerization and immobilization processes. The photocatalytic ability of hybrid nanocomposites was maintained even after surface functionalization and a temperature-controlled switching effect was observed during the degradation of Rhod B. The presented smart materials could be facilely prepared and efficiently recovered to avoid secondary pollution due to the self-flocculation effect, which are potentially useful for photocatalytic water treatment. Novel hybrid nanocomposites with stimuli responsive to pH, solvents and biomacromolecules are under investigation.
