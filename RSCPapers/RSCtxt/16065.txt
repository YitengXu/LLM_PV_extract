    , Accepted 30th June 2022First published on 1st July 2022AbstractDue to their unique property of possessing localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), metal nanoparticles (MNPs) have drastically impacted many applications. For instance, local field enhancement through LSPRs and plasmonic hot electron transfer are known to enhance the efficiency of MNP-based photoreactions. Here, we report on the ultrafast electron transfer from gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) to methylene blue (MB) molecular adsorbate using femtosecond pump–probe and steady-state absorption and emission spectroscopy techniques. Although the energy band alignment of the interface allows both dipole–dipole Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and charge transfer, because the MB emission intensity at the Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite decreased by a factor of ∼3.6, the FRET process was ruled out. Selective excitation of LSPRs at the Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite sample in pump–probe experiments led to the formation of the MB ground-state depletion and a positive induced absorption at wavelengths shorter than ∼500 nm, which was attributed to the shoulder of the MB− anion absorption. Furthermore, despite the fact that the concentration of Au-NPs in the nanocomposite sample is the same as that in the Au-NPs solution, the initial intensity of the LSPR depletion signal was about six times weaker than that in the Au-NPs sample. These observations suggest that electron transfer from excited Au-NPs to MB adsorbates took place on a time-scale that is shorter than the ∼50 fs experimental temporal resolution.
Introduction
The beating heart of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) is their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), which is a collective oscillation of surface conduction band (CB) electrons. Due to the nanoscale quantum confinement of MNPs, one can tailor their LSPRs to specific needs.1,2 This excellent property has made LSPRs highly suitable in various applications ranging from photodetection,3 photocatalysis,4 photovoltaics,5,6 to integrated quantum information science.7 Upon resonant photoexcitation of MNPs, excited LSPRs rapidly relax via two pathways: a radiative decay process by emitting photons, and a non-radiative channel by creating hot electron–hole pairs through Landau damping on a sub-100 fs time-scale.8–12 These highly energetic hot electrons rapidly transfer their energy to the thermal equilibrium electrons via electron–electron scatterings on a sub-100 fs time-scale, followed by electron–phonon cooling within a few ps, and heat dissipation from the MNPs to the environment through phonon–phonon scatterings during 100 s of ps.13–15 Radiative decay of LSPRs is beneficial for local field enhancement-based applications, such as light emitting devices and ultrafast photo-switching,16 and the Landau damping process is useful in applications where electron transfer is needed, such as in photodetection and photocatalysis.17 Despite the challenging requirement of transferring LSPR electrons and/or energy before their relaxation, several efforts have been successful.18 For instance, visible pump/infrared probe studies reported that hot electron transfer from gold (Au) nanodots to TiO2 nanocrystals takes place on a time-scale on the order of ∼240 fs with ∼40% yield.19 Also, electron transfer from Au25 clusters to pyrene has been reported to happen on a ∼500 fs time-scale.20 Furthermore, the presence of Au-NPs in Ag-NWs@TiO2 core–shell nanocomposite has been reported to promote hot carrier transfer due to a plasmonic coupling effect.21 Additionally, transient absorption spectroscopy and photocatalytic action spectrum measurements carried out on Au/SiO2/Cu2O sandwich nanostructure, indicated that dipole–dipole Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from Au to Cu2O happens on a sub-100 fs time-scale.22
Recent studies of interfaces involving MNPs and methylene blue (MB) molecular adsorbates using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique have attributed the observed photoinduced chemical transformations to hot electron transfer to MB.23–25 Here, we incorporate femtosecond transient absorption and steady-state absorption and emission spectroscopies to report on the ultrafast electron transfer from ∼40 nm-diameter Au-NPs to MB molecular adsorbates. Selective excitation of Au-NPs in the Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite in transient absorption experiments led to a six-fold decrease in the initial amplitude of the LSPR depletion signal, accompanied with a formation of the MB ground-state depletion. These observations are attributed to the transfer of excited electrons from Au-NPs to MB adsorbates on a time-scale that is shorter than the experimental temporal resolution of ∼50 fs. Furthermore, although dipole–dipole FRET process is allowed based on the alignment of energy levels of the interface, it is ruled out because the MB emission intensity decreased more than three times in the nanocomposite sample compared to that in the MB aqueous sample. These results shed more light on the ultrafast dynamics of plasmonic charge transfer to organic molecules, which is beneficial for the incorporation of MNPs in dye-sensitized solar-cells to enhance the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency.26
Materials and methods
Subject material
Commercial Au-NPs (nanospheres of ∼40 nm size) dissolved in deionized water and MB powder are purchased from nanoComposix and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. To prepare the Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite, the stock solution of Au-NPs is divided into two samples, and the MB powder is added to one of them and sonicated for five minutes. To maintain the concentration of Au-NPs in the Au-NPs/MB sample the same as that in the Au-NPs solution, the Au-NPs/MB mixture is diluted using the Au-NPs stock solution. A control sample of MB dissolved in deionized water is made with the same concentration of that in the Au-NPs/MB sample.
Spectroscopy methods

Femtosecond pump–probe measurements. 
A detailed description of the femtosecond pump–probe experimental setup has been previously reported.27,28 Briefly, it is based on a Titanium:Sapphire femtosecond amplifier (Astrella, Coherent Inc.), which provides pulses centred at ∼800 nm, ∼35 femtosecond duration, and 6 W average power at a repetition rate of 5 kHz. A small portion of the amplifier's output is focused on a 2 mm thick sapphire window to generate a spectrally broad (480–920 nm) white light supercontinuum (WL) probe. To minimize the optical chirp in the spectrally broad WL probe, a reflective parabolic mirror is used for collimation, and a reflective filter (which transmits 800 nm and reflects other wavelengths) is used for the filtration of the 800 nm fundamental laser. Excitation pump at 400 nm is generated in a 0.5 mm thin beta barium borate (BBO) crystal by frequency-doubling the 800 nm fundamental laser. This frequency doubling is done without focusing and collimating lenses to maintain the pulse ultrashort duration, and the residual 800 nm is rejected through a short-pass filter. The 580 nm excitation pump is generated by frequency-doubling in a BBO crystal the near infrared signal output of an optical parametric amplifier (OPA), which is a TOPAS Prime by Coherent Inc.
The pump and probe beams are brought collinearly into a home-built inverted-upright hybrid microscope based on an Olympus IX71, using various thin (0.5 mm thickness) dichroic filters (which transmit the WL probe and reflect the pump). The collinear pump and probe beams are focused on the sample using a calcium fluoride (CaF2) lens with 35 mm focal length that is mounted on the microscope nosepiece. After the sample, the two beams are collimated using a second CaF2 lens, and the pump is filtered out. The collimated WL probe exiting the microscope is focused onto a 100 μm slit entrance of a spectrograph (Horiba iHR320), which is coupled with a CCD (Newton, Andor) equipped with an electron multiplier (EM). To cancel out long-term laser fluctuations, the pump beam passes through an optical chopper set to a 50 Hz frequency, and at every time-delay, the absorbance change is calculated between every 50 successive laser shots. In every experiment, six scans over the covered time-delay range are averaged. The instrument response function (IRF) is measured by cross-correlating the pump and probe pulses in a 100 μm thin film of vanadium oxide (VO2) on a sapphire substrate, and suggesting a temporal resolution on the order of ∼50 fs. In all 400 nm-pump/probe experiments, the pump density is kept the same at ∼8 μJ cm−2. Liquid samples are poured in a 10 × 10 mm square well with a 2 mm depth, drilled in a 25 × 25 mm quartz window then covered with a second flat window of 1 mm thickness. The two windows are mounted on a customized aluminium sample holder that is placed horizontally on the microscope motorized XY stage. While the polarization of the pump pulse is parallel to sample's plane, the polarization of the WLC probe is mixed at the sample and detection.


Steady-state absorption and emission. 
The home-built upright-inverted microscope is equipped with a tungsten halogen light source (HL-2000-LL Ocean Optics) used for measuring the steady-state absorption from the same spot on the sample studied in pump–probe experiments. The detection system used for steady-state absorption and emission studies is the same as that for pump–probe measurements.

Results and discussion
In order to evaluate the possibility of achieving charge and/or energy transfers at the interface of Au-NPs and MB adsorbates, we depict in Fig. 1(a) the energy band alignment of the interface. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of MB are reported to be at ∼−6.26 eV and ∼−4.5 eV, respectively.29 The Fermi energy level of bulk Au is reported to be ∼−5.1 eV,30 and it shifts to ∼−4 eV for NPs (supported on titanium dioxide) of ∼4 nm diameter with a slight dependence on the NP size where it increases by ∼3 meV when the size of the particle increases to ∼13 nm.31 Since Au-NPs used in this work have a diameter of ∼40 nm, one may consider that their Fermi level is even higher than −4 eV. Based on this energy diagram, electron transfer from excited LSPRs in Au-NPs to the LUMO level of the MB adsorbate is possible.
 Fig. 1  (a) A schematic of the mechanism of electron transfer from excited Au-NPs to MB adsorbates. The values of HOMO and LUMO levels of the MB molecule29 and the Fermi level for bulk Au30 and Au-NPs31 are adopted from previous reports. (b) Steady-state absorption spectra of Au, MB, and Au/MB aqueous samples as indicated. The dashed line is a spectrum obtained by subtracting the Au absorption spectrum from that of Au/MB. (c) Emission spectra of MB with and without Au-NPs following excitation at 580 nm. The spectrum measured from the Au-NPs/MB sample is magnified 3.6 times for a better visual comparison. 
The steady-state absorption spectra of Au-NPs, Au-NPs/MB, and MB in water are shown in Fig. 1(b). We started by dividing the Au-NP stock solution into two samples, then we added to one of them MB powder to guarantee that the concentration of Au-NPs is the same in both samples. To adjust the MB concentration, the nanocomposite sample is diluted using the Au-NPs stock solution. The spectra of both samples contain the LSPR peak centred around 520 nm. Also shown in Fig. 1(b) is the absorption spectrum of MB aqueous solution (blue solid plot), which contains a main peak around 660 nm and a shoulder peak around 610 nm, which is assigned to vibronic subband and residual dimer absorption.32–34 To verify that MB in the Au-NPs/Au nanocomposite is not aggregating, the spectrum of the Au-NPs sample is subtracted from that of Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite, and the resulting spectrum is similar to that of the MB aqueous solution with the exception of a small reduction in absorption around the dimer's peak (∼610 nm).
To confirm that MB molecules are not aggregating in the presence of Au-NPs, photoluminescence measurements are carried out. Shown in Fig. 1(c) are the steady-state emission spectra collected upon excitation at ∼580 nm of MB and Au-NPs/MB samples. We note that based on the absorption spectra shown in Fig. 1(b), both MB and Au-NPs absorb at ∼580 nm, and based on the spectral overlap of the two components of the nanocomposite, dipole–dipole FRET is possible.35 Although the MB emission spectra have identical shapes, which suggests that MB adsorbates are not aggregating, the emission intensity in the case of Au-NPs/MB sample is more than three times weaker than in the case of the MB aqueous sample; and it is blue shifted by ∼5 nm due to the change in the dielectric environment. The decrease in the MB emission intensity suggests that charge transfer from Au-NPs to MB has occurred. Injecting electrons to the LUMO level of the MB adsorbates, leads to the formation of MB anions (MB−), and in an ensemble photoluminescence measurement, the MB emission intensity decreases. Furthermore, if energy transfer from excited Au-NPs to MB has occurred (or at least if it is the dominating process), one expects the MB emission collected from Au-NPs/MB sample to increase, but since it decreased by a factor of ∼3.6, we conclude that energy transfer is at least not the dominant process at the studied nanocomposite.
The strategy for confirming electron transfer from Au-NPs to MB adsorbates and measuring its dynamics consists of selectively exciting Au-NPs in the Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite sample and comparing the resulting spectral and dynamical features to those measured at the Au-NPs sample.
The spectral and dynamical features of the Au-NPs aqueous solution, recorded up to 100 ps time-delays following excitation of the Au-NPs sample at ∼400 nm, are shown in Fig. 2(a). Transient spectra at a few time-delays are shown in Fig. 2(d). These spectra contain a negative band centred around 525 nm overlapping with a positive band. According to the steady-state absorption spectrum of Au-NPs shown in Fig. 1(b), the negative band is attributed to the depletion of the LSPR transition, and the positive band is assigned to the excited-state induced absorption.
 Fig. 2  Transient absorption traces recorded up to 100 ps following excitation at ∼400 nm of aqueous samples (a) Au-NPs, (b) Au-NPs/MB, and (c) MB. Transient spectra recorded at the indicated time-delays for samples (d) Au-NPs, (e) Au-NPs/MB, and (f) MB. The insets in (e) and (f) are amplitude-zooms around the indicated wavelength range. 
To investigate a possible charge transfer from Au-NPs to MB molecular adsorbates, the Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite is excited with the same pump (photon energy and density) as the Au-NPs sample, and the resulting transient absorption traces recorded up to 100 ps time-delay are shown in Fig. 2(b). Transient spectra at a few time-delays are shown in Fig. 2(e). A visual comparison of these results to those measured at the Au-NPs sample shown in Fig. 2(a) and (d) indicates that the LSPR depletion peak center shifts from ∼524 nm in the case of the Au-NPs sample to ∼528 nm in the case of the Au-NPs/MB sample. This is expected because adsorbing MB molecules at the surface of Au-NPs affects their optical properties as it has been reported previously.36 Furthermore, three additional distinctions are as follows:
(i) Despite that both samples have the same concentration of Au-NPs and both experiments are carried out using the same pump photon-energy and density, the amplitude of the LSPR depletion signal (around 525 nm) is about six times weaker than that in the case of the Au-NPs sample.
(ii) The amplitude of the positive induced absorption signal (around 490 nm) is about 80% to that of the LSPR depletion signal, whereas in the case of the Au-NPs sample, it was less than 25% to that of the LSPR depletion signal.
(iii) The spectra contain, in addition to the LSPR depletion and the induced absorption signals, two weak negative bands around 580 nm and 680 nm.
According to the steady-state absorption spectrum of MB shown in Fig. 1(b), we assign these weak negative signals observed around 580 and 680 nm to the depletion of the MB ground state absorption. We note that the negative high-energy band around 580 nm is blue-shifted compared to the steady state spectrum shown in Fig. 1(b) where it occurs at ∼610 nm, suggesting some dimerization of MB adsorbates, which is consistent with previous reports that indicated dimerization of MB at charged interfaces.37,38 Based on the steady-state absorption spectrum of the MB sample shown in Fig. 1(b), an excitation around 400 nm of the Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite should not lead to an excitation of the MB molecular adsorbates, and consequently, a depletion of the MB ground-state transition should not be observed. To confirm this, we excited the MB aqueous solution, which has the same concentration as that of MB in the nanocomposite sample as shown in Fig. 1(b), and with the same pump (photon energy and density) as in the case of the transient absorption experiment carried on the nanocomposite sample. The results shown in Fig. 2(c) and (f) indicate that under these conditions (MB concentration, pump photon-energy, and pump density), no depletion of the MB ground-state transition is observed. Consequently, one can conclude that the depletion of the MB ground-state transition observed in Fig. 2(b) and (e) for the nanocomposite sample is likely due to electron transfer from excited LSPRs of Au-NPs to MB adsorbates. We note that upon charge transfer, the MB adsorbate is reduced and will no longer be in its neutral ground-state, and a depletion of the ground-state transition is observed in a pump–probe experiment.35 We note that although the observed MB ground-state depletion signal can be caused by energy transfer from excited LSPRs to MB as well, because we excluded this possibility in the discussion of emission results (or at least minimized its likelihood), we limit the discussion of transient absorption results to the possibility of electron transfer.
To shed more light on the investigation of electron transfer from Au-NPs to MB molecular adsorbates, we compare the LSPR depletion dynamics measured at the Au-NPs sample and the MB ground-state depletion measured at the MB aqueous sample to those measured at the Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite. The results are shown in Fig. 3. We fitted the LSPR depletion dynamics to a multiexponential decay function convoluted with the IRF. Because the LSPR depletion signal (negative amplitude around 525 nm) and the excited-state induced absorption (positive amplitude around 490 nm) are overlapping, when fitting the dynamics of each signal, we included one component with an opposite amplitude sign to account for the effect of the other signal. The retuned fit parameters are list in Table 1.

Shown in Fig. 3(a) are the dynamics of the LSPR ground-state depletion signal measured from the Au-NPs and Au-NPs/MB samples. In the case of the nanocomposite, the signal is magnified six times for a better visual comparison. In the case of the Au-NPs sample, the majority of the LSPR excited population decays with a time-constant of ∼1.1 ps, and the remaining population decays with a time-constant of ∼333 ps. The fast component is assigned to electron–electron scattering and electron–phonon relaxation, which have been reported to take place on sub-ps and a few ps time-scales, respectively.13,14 The slow component is attributed to phonon–phonon relaxations.13,14 Although the LSPR depletion recovery dynamics in the nanocomposite sample seem faster compared to those measured at the Au-NPs sample, the importance of the signal amplitude needs careful consideration. Because the two samples are excited with the same pump wavelength and density, and since they both contain the same concentration of Au-NPs, the amplitude of the LSPR depletion signal should be the same in both samples. The fact that the LSPR depletion signal measured from the Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite is six times weaker than that observed at the Au-NPs sample suggests that the “missing” amplitude is due to electron transfer to MB adsorbates. We hypothesize that because the electron transfer is faster than the temporal resolution of the experiment, the dynamics at early time-delays are not captured. When we forced the fit of the LSPR depletion in the case of the Au-NPs/MB sample to consider the initial amplitude equal to that in the case of the Au-NPs sample as shown in Fig. 3(b), the fit required an additional decay component with a time-constant of ∼24 fs (component 4 in Table 1). We recognise that this analysis does not reveal the real electron transfer time, but it only suggests that the electron transfer time is faster than the experimental temporal resolution. We note that a plasmonic electron transfer from silver (Ag) NPs to silver chloride cubic cages (AgCl) faster than the experimental temporal resolution has been reported.39
Shown in Fig. 3(c) is a comparison of the dynamics around 490 nm. In the case of the Au-NPs sample, by the 10 ps time-delay, the signal completely decayed to zero and it required only one exponential decay component with a time-constant of ∼1.2 ps. However, in the case of the nanocomposite sample, the dynamics required a second exponential decay component with a time-constant of ∼227 ps to account for the remaining excited population beyond the ∼10 ps time-delay. We note that the amplitude, and thus the population, of the slow component is almost negligible (∼1/30) compared to the population decaying with the fast component.
Unlike in the case of the Au-NPs sample where the positive signal at ∼490 nm originates only from the excited state of LSPRs, in the case of the nanocomposite sample, it has additional possible causes. For instance, according to previous reports, it coincides with the MB excited-state absorption and with the “red” shoulder of the MB− anion absorption.40,41 The contribution of MB excited-state absorption due to direct excitation of MB by the pump can be excluded for the same reasons listed above when we discussed the origin of the observed MB ground-state depletion. However, the contributions of the MB excited-state and/or anion absorptions due to energy and/or charge transfer, respectively, from excited LSPRs to the MB adsorbate are possible.
To decide whether the origin of the observed MB ground-state depletions (at ∼580 nm and ∼680 nm) and the positive induced absorption (at wavelengths below 500 nm) is charge transfer or energy transfer, we compared the MB depletion recovery dynamics at the Au-NPs/MB sample to those recorded following a direct excitation at ∼580 nm of the MB aqueous sample as shown in Fig. 4. Because the amplitude of the low energy depletion peak (∼680 nm) measured at the nanocomposite sample is very weak (∼0.1 mOD as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(e)), we considered the dynamics of the high-energy band (580–610 nm). The dynamics of the MB ground-state depletion and excited-state induced absorption that form because of energy transfer from Au-NPs should be similar to those measured upon direct excitation of the MB aqueous sample at ∼580 nm. According to Fig. 4 and Table 1, the MB depletion signal in the case of the Au-NPs/MB sample recovers with a time-constant of ∼1 ps, whereas, upon direct excitation of the MB aqueous sample, the ground-state depletion recovery takes 100's of ps. This suggests that the MB ground-state depletions observed at ∼580 nm and ∼680 nm, and the positive induced absorption observed at ∼490 nm at the Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite are more likely due to electron transfer than to energy transfer from Au-NPs to MB adsorbates.
 Fig. 4  Dynamics of the MB depletion signal averaged around 580 nm following excitation at ∼400 nm of the Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite sample, and averaged around 610 nm for the MB aqueous sample following excitation at ∼580 nm. Solid plots are fits to a multiexponential decay function convoluted with the IRF. Time-delay axes are plotted in a linear scale up to 1 ps time-delay, and in a logarithmic scale thereafter. 
Conclusion
In summary, we employed steady-state absorption and emission spectroscopies, and femtosecond transient absorption to investigate electron transfer from Au-NPs to MB molecular adsorbates. Although the energy band alignment of the interface allows both dipole–dipole FRET and charge transfer, because the MB emission intensity at the Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite decreased by a factor of ∼3.6, the FRET process was ruled out, or its likelihood was at least minimized. Selective excitation of LSPRs at the Au-NPs/MB nanocomposite in pump–probe experiments led to the formation of the MB ground-state depletion and a positive induced absorption at wavelengths shorter than ∼500 nm, which was attributed to the shoulder of the MB− anion absorption. Furthermore, despite the fact that the concentration of Au-NPs in the nanocomposite sample is the same as that in the Au-NPs solution, the initial intensity of the LSPR depletion signal was about six times weaker than that in the Au-NPs sample. These observations suggested that electron transfer from excited Au-NPs to MB adsorbates took place on a time-scale that is shorter than the ∼50 fs experimental temporal resolution. Capturing the electron transfer dynamics at the MNP/organic molecular adsorbate using a sub-20 fs temporal resolution is our next step for a better understanding of the process, which will be beneficial to the incorporation of MNPs in dye-sensitized solar-cells with enhanced conversion efficiency.

 	Fig. 1  (a) A schematic of the mechanism of electron transfer from excited Au-NPs to MB adsorbates. The values of HOMO and LUMO levels of the MB molecule29 and the Fermi level for bulk Au30 and Au-NPs31 are adopted from previous reports. (b) Steady-state absorption spectra of Au, MB, and Au/MB aqueous samples as indicated. The dashed line is a spectrum obtained by subtracting the Au absorption spectrum from that of Au/MB. (c) Emission spectra of MB with and without Au-NPs following excitation at 580 nm. The spectrum measured from the Au-NPs/MB sample is magnified 3.6 times for a better visual comparison.	 

 	Fig. 2  Transient absorption traces recorded up to 100 ps following excitation at ∼400 nm of aqueous samples (a) Au-NPs, (b) Au-NPs/MB, and (c) MB. Transient spectra recorded at the indicated time-delays for samples (d) Au-NPs, (e) Au-NPs/MB, and (f) MB. The insets in (e) and (f) are amplitude-zooms around the indicated wavelength range.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) LSPR depletion dynamics averaged around 525 nm. (b) Same as in (a) but the fit is forced to consider the initial amplitude of the signal in the case of the nanocomposite sample equal to that in the case of Au-NPs sample. (c) Dynamics of the induced absorption averaged around 490 nm. Solid plots are fits to a multiexponential decay function convoluted with the IRF. Time-delay axes are plotted in a linear scale up 1 ps time-delay, and in a logarithmic scale thereafter.
