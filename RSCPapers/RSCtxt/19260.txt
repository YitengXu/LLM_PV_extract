    , Accepted 11th September 2017First published on 13th September 2017AbstractMoS2 material is considered as a promising anode material candidate in Na-ion batteries (NIBs) due to its high theoretical capacity and layered structure. However, MoS2 nanosheets usually tend to restack or aggregate during the synthesis and cycling process, which makes the advantages of the separated nanosheets disappear. Here, we present a PVP-assisted synthesis for growing long hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers with a length up to 74.5 μm, which were further assembled from intercrossed curly nanosheets with expanded (002) interlayer spacings in the range of 0.62 nm to 1.14 nm. Such architectural design simultaneously combines multiple-scale structural features that are desired for Na-ion storage. On the one hand, the nanosheets can provide a large surface area which is in contact with the electrolyte, a short Na-ion diffusion pathway from the lateral side and facile Na-ion insertion and extraction through the expanded (002) interlayer; on the other hand, the hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers possess a one dimensional structure and a suitable amount of carbon, which can both serve as an electrical highway and prevent them from restacking, resulting in an enhanced electrochemical performance. When used as an anode in NIBs, they demonstrated excellent cycling performance (537 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 after 200 cycles, and 370 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 over 200 cycles) and outstanding rate capability (329 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1).
Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries have been the dominant power source for portable electronic devices due to their outstanding energy density and long cycle life. Nonetheless, there is increasing concern about their cost and the limitation of lithium reserves for their large-scale applications in electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems. Over the last few years, Na-ion batteries (NIBs) have drawn more and more attention because sodium has high natural abundance, low cost and a suitable redox potential (versus the standard hydrogen electrode).1 However, it is still difficult to find suitable electrode materials with a high energy density and long cycle life for NIBs because the Na-ion has a lager ionic radius than the Li-ion, which restricts Na-ion insertion/extraction in host materials, resulting in sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics and high volume expansion.2 Some mature host materials suitable for LIBs such as graphite and Si are hardly applied to NIBs directly.3 The recent theoretical calculations and experiment observations have shown that a minimum interlayer distance of 0.37 nm is required for Na-ion insertion, which is much larger than that required for lithium-ions (0.34 nm).4,5
MoS2 material is considered as a promising anode material candidate in NIBs since it has a very high theoretical capacity of 670 mA h g−1, but more importantly, its (002) crystal plane possesses an interplanar space of 0.615 nm that can favour efficient Na-ion intercalation.6–8 However, as a typical 2D layered transition metal sulphide, MoS2 has an analogous structure of graphene. Therefore, MoS2 nanosheets or MoS2/graphene nanosheets inevitably restacked or aggregated during the synthesis and cycling process because of their van der Waals force and high surface energy.9 This would decrease the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, and increase Na-ion diffusion resistance. For example, MoS2/graphene composite, MoS2-raw and pristine reduced graphene oxide papers have been evaluated as anodes for NIBs at a current density of 25 mA g−1, which only deliver capacities of 218 mA h g−1, 70.5 mA h g−1 and 100 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles, respectively.10 To address these problems, one effective approach is to build nanosheet assembled 3D structures such as flower-like and sphere-like hierarchical structures, which can avoid stacking, expose a large surface area and shorten the Na-ion diffusion path.7 However, most of these structures still showed low discharge capacity, poor capacity retention and a short cycle life since the volume expansion upon cycling causes a large mechanical strain, resulting in structural degradation and loses electronic contacts among active materials. The introduction of a protective layer such as TiO211 or conductive carbon materials (e.g. amorphous carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers)12–18 in the composite is also considered to improve structural stability or conductivity. But TiO2 and carbon materials in these composites contributed negligibly to Na-ion capacity storage, and thus suppressed the overall energy density. In addition, complicated, time consuming and expensive synthetic processes such as atomic layer deposition, electrospinning and chemical vapour deposition techniques are required to achieve the above strategies. Wang and coworkers have developed an efficient method to grow MoS2 nanosheets on carbon nanotubes and carbon cloth, which can both increase the exposed edges of MoS2 nanosheets and provide a stable structure for electrocatalysis.19,20 Therefore, it is also highly desirable to develop a low-cost, facile and efficient approach to fabricate novel MoS2 electrodes with excellent structural stability for highly reversible Na-ion storage.
Here, we present a PVP-assisted strategy for the synthesis of long hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers assembled from intercrossed curly nanosheets with expanded interlayer spacing. This unique architectural design simultaneously combines multiple-scale structural features that are desired for Na-ion storage, and leads to an improved reversible capacity, enhanced cycling stability and outstanding rate capabilities.
Experimental section
Material synthesis
All chemical reagents are analytical grade and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis, 0.1 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, molecular weight (Mw) = 1300000, Aladdin) was added to a mixture of 20 ml ethanol and 2 ml ammonia solution (25 w/w%) under magnetic stirring, followed by the addition of 0.12 g Na2MoO4 and 0.09 g thiourea. After further stirring for 30 min, they were transferred into a 50 ml Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and heated at 240 °C for 28 h. After cooling naturally, the hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers were collected and washed with ethanol several times, and then dried at 70 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. To investigate the role of PVP in the growth of hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers, other MWs of PVP (PVPMW = 8000, PVPMW = 10000, PVPMW = 24000, and PVPMW = 58000) and different amounts of PVPMW = 1300000 (0.0 g, 0.02 g, 0.05 g and 0.075) were also applied while keeping the other reaction conditions unchanged. Finally, the hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers and MoS2 microspheres, fabricated by using 0.1 g and 0.0 g of PVP MW = 1300000, respectively, were calcined at 800 °C for 2 h with a stream of 5% hydrogen in nitrogen flowing at 50 sccm to further improve their crystallinity and electrochemical performance.21
Material characterization
The morphology of the sample was checked by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Quanta 400, FEI Company). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on an X-ray diffractometer (D/Max-IIIA, Rigaku, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were performed using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope operated at 200 keV. Thermogravimetry (TG) and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves were recorded on a Thermogravimetry analyser (TG209, Netzsch Instruments, Germany) at temperatures of 20 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air. N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms were examined using a nitrogen adsorption–desorption apparatus at 77 K (NOVA1200 instrument, Quantachrome Corporation). Raman spectra were recorded from 300 to 2000 cm−1 using a Horiba Jobin Yvon XploRa confocal Raman microscope, and the wavelength of the excitation laser was 532 nm.
Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical measurements were evaluated using an CR2032 coin cell, which was assembled using MoS2 electrodes as the working electrode, Na metal foil as the counter electrode and a glass microfiber disk (Whatman GF/F) as the separator in an argon-filled glovebox (Mikarouna). For preparing the anode, the active material (e.g., MoS2 hierarchical structures and MoS2 microspheres), carbon black, and polyvinylidene fluoride were mixed with a weight ratio of 7:2:1 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and the resultant slurry was uniformly coated onto the copper foil and then dried overnight at 100 °C in a vacuum. The mass loading of the active material in the electrodes was controlled at about 1.7–2.1 mg cm−2. The electrolyte utilized was 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dethyl carbonate (DMC) with a volume ratio of 1:1. The half-cells were tested using a NEWARE battery testing system with various cycling current densities between 0.01 and 2.5 V (vs. Na/Na+). After cells were cycled at 2 A g−1 for 200 cycles, they were disassembled in an argon-filled glovebox, and the anode materials were washed off with the residual electrolyte in dimethyl carbonate (DMC) for SEM and TEM analysis. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded using an electrochemical workstation (AUTOLAB PGSTAT302n).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a and b show the FESEM images of post-annealed hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers. It can be seen that large scale, uniform, monodisperse and hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers with an average diameter of 276 nm and a length up to 74.5 μm are produced after hydrothermal reaction and subsequent calcination. As shown in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1c), all diffraction peak positions of the post-annealed hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers agree well with the phase of hexagonal MoS2 (JCPDS No. 37-1492).

Fig. 2a and the inset show a TEM image and SAED pattern of a typical post-annealed hierarchical MoS2 nanofiber. It can be seen from the TEM image that the MoS2 nanofibers are composed of numerous curly nanosheets with a thickness of 4–20 nm. The SAED pattern shows the diffraction rings of hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers, indicating their polycrystalline nature. As shown in the magnified TEM image (Fig. 2b), a typical nanosheet contains 20 layers of (002) planes. Fig. 2c–f show the zoom-in TEM images corresponding to the different positions shown in Fig. 2b, and the lattice distance of 0.27 nm, corresponding to the assigned (100) crystal planes was observed on the nanosheet surface. It is interestingly found that curly nanosheets maximally exposed their stripe edges of the (002) crystal plane. The distance of the adjacent stripes at the different positions is in the range of 0.62 nm to 1.14 nm, and most of them are larger than the layer-to-layer distance of 0.615 nm in bulk MoS2 and the previously reported value of MoS2 nanosheets.22 We infer that the PVP residue during the synthesis was transformed into a very thin amorphous carbon layer after calcination. Thus, the curly structure of nanosheets and amorphous carbon layers distributed among the interplanar space of (002) planes lead to the uneven interspacing distribution.

The information about amorphous carbon contained in MoS2 was further investigated using TG/DTG, XRD and Raman spectra measurements. As shown in Fig. 3a, four distinct weight loss steps are observed in the TG curve. The first 3.3% weight loss before 200 °C is ascribed to the evaporation of water in the sample. The second 17.1% weight loss ranging from 265 °C to 415 °C can be attributed to the decomposition and carbonization of PVP as well as the oxidation of MoS2 to MoO3. The third 8.3% weight loss occurring between 416 °C and 530 °C corresponds to the combustion of amorphous carbon in the MoS2. The drastic weight loss after 680 °C is due to the sublimation of MoO3.23 Three obvious peaks located at 374 °C, 437 °C and 789 °C were observed in the DTG curve, which represent the maximum weight loss rate occurring in the above different weight loss steps of the TG curve. Thus, a series of XRD analyses were conducted to confirm the composition and crystallinity of intermediate products in hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers, which were collected at different interrupting temperatures under air atmosphere corresponding to the labelled peaks in the DTG curve. Fig. S1a† shows the XRD pattern of the hydrothermal obtained hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers after the heat treatment at 282 °C. A broad peak that appears around 2θ = 24°–28° is assigned to the amorphous carbon phase; whereas the peaks located at 2θ = 32.7°, 33.5°and 58.3° are indexed to (100), (101) and (110) of the MoS2 phase. After the sample was calcined at 374 °C, the MoS2 phase is transformed into the MoO3 phase with low crystallinity, and three peaks at 2θ = 23.3°, 25.7°and 27.3° overlap with the broad peak of the amorphous carbon (Fig. S1b†). While increasing the temperature to 437 °C, peaks of the MoO3 become sharper, and the broad peak of amorphous carbon almost disappears (Fig. S1c†). When the samples were heated to 789 °C (Fig. S1d†) and 800 °C (Fig. S1e†), well-crystallized MoO3 is still maintained; whereas the residues in the alumina crucible were markedly reduced due to its sublimation, which is consistent with the weight loss in the TG curve.

Raman spectroscopy also confirmed that the amorphous carbon existed in the hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers. As shown in Fig. 3b, two characteristic peaks, usually representing the D- and G-bands of graphene, were detected at 1350 and 1580 cm−1, respectively. We infer that the amorphous carbon layer that derived from PVP may exist among the (002) planes of MoS2, forming graphene-like structures. This can account for the expanded interlayer spacing (>0.62 nm) between the adjacent stripes of (002) planes as observed in TEM results. Furthermore, other peaks corresponded to MoS2 were also detected in both hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers and MoS2 micropheres.24,25 Fig. S2† shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the MoS2 and their corresponding pore size distribution curves, respectively. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to evaluate the specific surface area from gas adsorption data, and the calculated value for hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers is 46.27 m2 g−1. In addition, pore size distribution characteristics were investigated from the adsorption branch of the isotherms by using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, and three narrowed peaks centred at 2 nm, 3 nm and 31 nm are demonstrated, which are in agreement with the interior void surrounded by curly nanosheets as observed in the TEM images.
To gain more insight into the formation mechanism of long hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers, we studied the effects of the MW of PVP and the additive amount of PVP on the MoS2 product formation while keeping other conditions unchanged. Fig. S3† shows a series of MoS2 products prepared without the addition of PVP and in the presence of PVP with different MWs. It can be seen that MoS2 microspheres with a size of about 2.5 μm were obtained when no PVP was added in the reaction solution (Fig. S3a†). When PVPMW = 8000, PVPMW = 10000 and PVPMW = 24000 were used, a large number of irregular particles and a small amount of short fibers were produced (as shown in Fig. S3b, S3c and S3d†). When PVPMW = 58000 and PVPMW = 1300000 were used, it can be seen that high-yield MoS2 nanofibers with a longer length and smaller diameter were produced (as shown in Fig. S3e and S3f†). Thus, the MW of PVP plays an important role in determining both the yield and aspect ratio of the nanofibers. It is suggested that PVP with a higher MW provides a longer chain, which has more power to go against the formation of MoS2 particles. Thus, PVPMW = 1300000 was further selected to investigate the effect of the additive amount on the MoS2 products. It was interestingly found that the yields of MoS2 nanofibers increased with the increase of the amount of the PVPMW = 1300000 from 0.00 g (Fig. S3a†) to 0.02 g (Fig. S4a†), to 0.05 g (Fig. S4b†), to 0.075 g (Fig. S4c†), and to 0.1 g (Fig. S1f,†Fig. 1a and b). Therefore, the relatively high amount of PVP with a long chain can serve as a structure directing agent for the growth of long MoS2 nanofibers, which may confine MoS2 nanocrystals in the PVP macromolecule matrix to prompt them grow along their longitudinal direction.26

Fig. 4a shows the representative cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the hierarchical MoS2 nanofiber electrode at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 between 0.01–3 V. In the first cathodic sweep, the reduction peaks at 1.0 V, 0.37 V and 0.055 V are assigned to a series of electrochemical reactions including the intercalation of Na+ ions into the MoS2 lattice, formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and conversion reaction of MoS2 into metallic Mo and Na2S matrix. In the anodic scans, the peaks at 1.74 V are correlated with the oxidation of metallic Mo to MoS2. From the second scan onwards, the curves are well overlapped that indicate that the stable and reversible Na+ ion disodiation–sodiation process occurs in electrodes.17,27,28

Fig. 4b shows the discharge/charge voltage curves of the hierarchical MoS2 nanofiber electrode in the first ten cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. It can be seen that an initial high discharge capacity of 990 mA h g−1 and a subsequent charge capacity of 690 mA h g−1 were achieved for the hierarchical MoS2 nanofiber electrode, indicating an irreversible capacity loss of 30.3%. The irreversible capacity loss for the initial cycles is due to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer.22,27,29 In the following 2nd, 5th and 10th cycles, the discharge and charge capacities were 617/599 mA h g−1, 598/574 mA h g−1, and 598/578 mA h g−1, respectively, corresponding to the enhanced and stable columbic efficiencies of 97.1%, 95.9% and 96.6% upon cycling.

Fig. 5a–d show the cycling performances of hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers and MoS2 microspheres at the current densities of 0.1 A g−1, 0.5 A g−1, 1 A g−1 and 2 A g−1, respectively. Obviously, the hierarchical MoS2 nanofiber electrodes exhibited much better cycling performance than MoS2 microspheres. After 200 cycles, they delivered high reversible capacities of 537 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 447 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 427 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, and 370 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1, corresponding to 88%, 88%, 93% and 89% of the 2nd discharge capacity, respectively. Furthermore, the hierarchical MoS2 nanofiber electrode demonstrated superior rate capabilities compared with MoS2 nanosphere electrodes. As shown in Fig. 5e, it could deliver a high discharge capacity of 614 mA h g−1, 536 mA h g−1, 490 mA h g−1, 461 mA h g−1 and 439 mA h g−1 when the current density changed stepwise from 0.1 A g−1 to 0.2 A g−1, 0.5 A g−1, 1 A g−1, and 2 A g−1, respectively. Even after experiencing a high current density of 5 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, it can still recover to its initial value. According to TG/DTG measurements, hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers contained about 8.3 wt% of amorphous carbon that contributed to negligible Na-ion capacity storage. However, hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers had higher reversible capacities and rate capability than those of the carbon-free MoS2 microspheres at all current densities. This can be explained that carbon-free MoS2 microspheres possess inherent poor electrical conductivity, a large Na-ion diffusion distance and a low surface area which is in contact with the electrolyte, which are unfavorable for the sodium-ion storage.14,18,27 However, the hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers are composed of nanosheets with an expanded (002) interlayer, which can provide a large surface area which is in contact with the electrolyte, a short Na-ion diffusion pathway from the lateral side and facile Na-ion insertion and extraction through the expanded (002) interlayer. Meanwhile, the hierarchical MoS2 nanofiber electrodes possess a one dimensional structure and a suitable amount of carbon, which can serve as an electrical highway, resulting in an enhanced electrochemical performance. In addition, we have repeatedly obtained high reversible capacities and stable cycling retention of three electrodes containing hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers at the current density of 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. S5a†), which are better than the results of three electrodes containing MoS2 microspheres (Fig. S5b†). In addition, Fig. S5c and S5d† show the corresponding Coulombic efficiency of hierarchical MoS2 nanofiber electrodes and MoS2 microsphere electrodes cycled at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. It can be seen that the initial Coulombic efficiencies (ICE) of hierarchical MoS2 nanofiber electrodes and MoS2 microsphere electrodes are in the range of 70%–76% and 61%–69%, respectively. The slightly different and relatively low ICE values for fresh cells may be correlated with the electrode material morphology (e.g., size, pore, structure), cell production time, and wetting process between the electrode and electrolyte as well as testing temperature fluctuations,30,31 which are often observed in LIBs and NIBs.3,5,16,18,27,29 To achieve high and stable cycling status and high ICE, the electrodes are usually fully wetted with the electrolyte during the process of the first few slow and shallow charge–discharge cycles so that the anode SEI layer is stably formed.5,10,31 It can be seen that after SEI films are stably formed in the 2nd cycle, the Coulombic efficiency values of both hierarchical MoS2 nanofiber electrodes and MoS2 microsphere electrodes increased to about 100%. The discharge capacity retention, cycling stability and rate capability for hierarchical MoS2 nanofiber electrodes reported here are also higher than those of previously reported MoS2 or its composite electrodes.10,12,16,18,21,23

Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were also recorded to reveal the kinetic process of Na-ion diffusion and electron transfer in hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers and MoS2 microsphere electrodes. Fig. 5f shows the Nyquist plots of both electrodes before galvanostatic discharging/charging and after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. An equivalent circuit was applied to fit the Nyquist plots to further study their kinetic parameters (Fig. S6†). The charge transfer resistances Rct of the fresh and cycled hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers are 137.1 Ω and 24.7 Ω, respectively, which are much smaller than those of fresh (201.5 Ω) and cycled MoS2 nanospheres (142.9 Ω). It can be explained that the hierarchical MoS2 nanofiber electrode possesses a one dimensional structure and a suitable amount of carbon, resulting in enhanced charge transfer. In addition, both cycled cells show decreased Rct values compared to both fresh ones, which may be due to the wetting process occurring between the electrode and the electrolyte after cycling.32
To reveal why the hierarchical MoS2 nanofiber electrode can maintain stable Na-ion storage performance, we measured the SEM and TEM morphology of hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers after completing 200 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1 (Fig. 6). It is encouraging to find that both one dimensional structure and nanosheet characteristics can be well preserved.

In conclusion, we have synthesized long hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers assembled from curly nanosheets using PVP as a structure-directing agent. This unique structure provides the desired structural characteristic required for high-performance anode materials in NIBs. On a primary nanoscale, separated nanosheets not only increase the contact area between the anode materials and electrolyte but also shorten the Na-ion diffusion pathway from the lateral side. More importantly, their edge-terminated structure can provide a large interlayer spacing for efficient Na-ion intercalation. On a secondary submicron scale, curly nanosheets were assembled into a one-dimensional structure that can provide an efficient electron pathway, prevent them from restacking, and accumulate the volume change. As a consequence, the hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers display a high discharge capacity, outstanding long-life cycling performance and excellent rate capability. We believe that our hierarchical MoS2 nanofibers with an expanded interlayer distance are very promising for further applications such as catalysts, detectors and supercapacitors.
