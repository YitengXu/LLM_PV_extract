    , Accepted 27th January 2015First published on 28th January 2015AbstractA general strategy to synchronously improve electron transport rate and lifetime for TiO2 photoanode by metal and F− dual doping is proposed and demonstrated for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) for the first time. Tin and fluorine dual-doped TiO2 nanoparticles are prepared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicates that the Sn atoms and the F atoms locate mainly in the TiO2 lattice and on the TiO2 particles surface, respectively. The DSSC based on Sn/F–TiO2 sample shows a high photoconversion efficiency of 8.89% under an AM 1.5 solar condition (100 mW cm−2), which is higher than those for the undoped TiO2 nanoparticles (7.12%) and the solely Sn (8.14%) or F doped (8.31%) samples. This improvement is attributed to the combined effects of a faster electron transport rate and a longer electron lifetime in the dual-doped TiO2 film. Following this strategy, we also prepare Ta/F, Nb/F, and Sb/F dual-doped TiO2 nanoparticles and find that the performance of DSSCs based on all the dual-doped samples is further improved compared with the single doping cases. Finally, through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the mechanism behind the improvement by tin and fluorine dual-doping is discussed in detail.
Introduction
Due to their low cost production, environmental friendliness, and relatively high photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted attention in recent years. A typical DSSC consists of a dye-sensitized electrode (photoanode), a redox electrolyte, and a platinized counter electrode.1 Among all types of photoanode materials (TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, Nb2O5, SrTiO3, and Zn2SnO4), the mesoscopic anatase TiO2 film is most widely studied due to its wide band-gap and high dye adsorption, and the PCE of DSSCs based anatase TiO2 reaches higher than 13%.2 The mesoscopic TiO2 film plays a critical role in the performance of DSSCs in light energy conversion, including the electron transfer from the dye molecules to the conduction band of TiO2 and the electron transport to the external circuit. Therefore, rational design of mesoscopic TiO2 film is crucial to improving the overall power conversion efficiency of devices.
To improve the performance of TiO2 photoanode, considerable work has been focused on enhancing the charge collection efficiency, such as tuning the position of the conduction band, improving charge transport,1 and suppressing charge recombination.3–7 Doping TiO2 with metal ions is a commonly adopted method to tailor the properties of TiO2 photoanodes,8 such as to improve the charge transport properties.9–12Table 1 shows the reported high values of PCE obtained in the DSSCs based on different doped TiO2 photoanodes (Table S1† presents the more detailed summary for the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs based on different doped TiO2, SnO2, and ZnO composites photoanodes). Recently, it was shown that homovalent doping (Zr doping) would also increase electron density and uplift the Fermi level of TiO2, thereby increasing the performance of DSSCs.36 Titanium and tin have the same number of valence electrons, and there is a large difference in ionic radii between them (rSnIV = 0.69 Å, rTiIV = 0.61 Å), similar to that between Zr and Ti. Their outer layer valence electrons also occupy different orbitals (5s2 and 5p2 for Sn, and 3d for Ti). Our previous work also found that an increasing electron density could be achieved by homovalent substitution of Sn doping in TiO2, which offered lower transport resistance.37

However, metal ion doping also introduces more charge recombination centers and leads to an increased charge recombination rate. Therefore, how to suppress electron recombination to further improve the performance of metal-doped TiO2 DSSCs becomes a challenging and extensively studied topic. Recently, several works reported that fluorine doping could inhibit charge recombination by tightly holding trapped electrons due to the strong electronegativity of fluorine and the formation of electron trapping sites.29,34,35 Based on these results, we proposed that the performance of metal-doped TiO2 DSSCs could be further improved by combining with F doping to inhibit charge recombination.
In this work, Sn and F dual-doped TiO2 was synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method, and the performance of DSSCs based on Sn and F dual-doped TiO2 was studied. We found that the charge transport of TiO2 is improved and charge recombination is suppressed in the dual-doped TiO2 films. Thus, compared with DSSCs based on solely Sn-doped (8.14%) TiO2 films, DSSCs based on Sn and F dual-doped TiO2 exhibit a higher PCE (8.89%) under an AM 1.5 solar condition (100 mW cm−2), which is also a high PCE compared with other reported high values for TiO2 DSSCs (Table 1). Furthermore, we also studied the performance of DSSCs based on Ta/F, Nb/F, and Sb/F dual-doped TiO2 and found that the performance of DSSCs based on the above dual-doped TiO2 simples were further improved compared with those of DSSCs based on singly doped TiO2. Finally, the dual doping effect is studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the synthesized samples are presented in Fig. 1. All peaks of the samples can be indexed to the anatase phase (JCPDS no. 89-4921), indicating that the anatase nanocrystalline structure is retained after doping. The lattice parameters for TiO2 and the doped TiO2 were estimated from the positions of the main diffraction peaks of the tetragonal phase. The strongest diffraction peak, (101) for the anatase phase, located at 25.36°, was studied and used in the determination of the average crystalline size of the samples using the Scherrer equation. As shown in Table 2, the crystal size was calculated to be ca. 14 nm for both TiO2 and the doped TiO2 samples. Table 2 shows the average values of the unit cell parameters for pure TiO2 and the doped TiO2 samples calculated by Bragg's formula. It can be seen from Table 2 that the insertion of Sn4+ into the TiO2 lattice could induce a slight expansion of the lattice, which could be attributed to the larger effective ionic radius of the Sn4+ ion (0.069 nm) than that of Ti4+ (0.061 nm). The TiO2 lattice has little change after doping with F, which was ascribed to the fact that F atoms exist mainly on the TiO2 particles' surface (from XPS results). Therefore, the TiO2–Sn sample and TiO2–Sn/F have similar lattice parameters.

Fig. 2 presents the TEM images of TiO2, TiO2–Sn, TiO2–F, and TiO2–Sn/F nanoparticles. It can be clearly seen that the average diameter size of TiO2 and the doped TiO2 samples is ca. 14 nm, which is in good agreement with the average size calculated from the XRD results. The HRTEM images in the insets of Fig. 2 indicate the high crystallinity of the TiO2 and the doped TiO2 nanoparticles.

To investigate the chemical states of doping Sn and F ions in TiO2, the binding energy (BE) of Ti2p, Sn3d, and F1s for the samples has been studied by XPS. Fig. 3(a) shows the Ti2p XPS spectra of TiO2, TiO2–Sn and TiO2–Sn/F. Comparing with the spectra for pure TiO2, the two peaks of the Ti2p spectra for TiO2–Sn exhibit a positive shift, which is ascribed to the interaction between tin atoms, oxygen atoms and titanium atoms. Consistent with this result, the Sn3d spectra for the TiO2–Sn sample reveal a negative shift (ca. 0.2 eV) toward lower binding energy compared to that of SnO2 (Fig. 3(b)), indicating the variation in electron negativities of the Ti and Sn elements (Ti = 1.54, Sn = 1.96).37 Compared with the TiO2–Sn (458.7 and 463.4 eV for Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2), the binding energy of TiO2–Sn/F increased to 458.9 and 463.6 eV after F-doping (TiF4) (as shown in Fig. 3(a)). This can be attributed to the different electron negativity of fluorine compared to oxygen (F = 4.0, O = 3.44). Based on this effect, the Sn3d spectra for the TiO2–Sn/F sample revealed a positive shift (ca. 0.2 eV) toward lower binding energy compared to that of TiO2–Sn. Fig. 3(c) gives the high-resolution XPS spectrum of F1s (ca. 684.6 eV). A small peak is identified at higher energy (689.2 eV), which is ascribed to the lattice F. Therefore, the detected F should correspond mainly either to graft on the TiO2 surface by substitution of the hydroxyl groups or physical adsorption.29

The flatband potentials of TiO2 and the doped TiO2 films at the semiconductor/electrolyte junction were obtained from Mott–Schottky plots (taken in the dark) using the following equation:38,39  
(where C is the capacitance of the space charge region, ε0 the vacuum permittivity, εTiO2 the dielectric constant of the TiO2 layer, e0 the elementary charge, E the applied potential, Efb the flat band potential, k the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, ND the donor density, and A the active surface). The intercepts of the fitted lines are Efb and the values are shown in Fig. 4. The slopes of the fitted lines are used to calculate the donor density (Table S2†).
 Fig. 4  Mott–Schottky plots for TiO2 and the doped TiO2 films. 
The Efb of TiO2 exhibits a slight positive shift after doping with F. The Efb of TiO2 was negatively shifted after doping with Sn/F, indicating a shift away from the redox potential, thereby an increment of Voc.

Fig. 5 shows the j–V plots of the DSSCs based on the TiO2 and the doped TiO2 photoanodes under light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at AM 1.5. The photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3. jsc, Voc and FF are short circuit photocurrent, open circuit photovoltage, and fill factor, respectively. For DSSCs based on pure TiO2, jsc, Voc, FF, and η are 14.82 mA cm−2, 686 mV, 0.71%, and 7.22%, respectively. After tin doping, the short-circuit photocurrent density, the open-circuit voltage and the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs were enhanced. The dye loading amount shown in Table 3 is similar for all the films, indicating that the enhancement of photocurrent for the doped TiO2 is not due to the increased dye adsorption. The higher jsc results from the enhanced electron transport (due to the changes in the electron density, Table S2†) in the TiO2 films and the higher Voc should result from the elevated Efb.37 The performance of DSSCs was further increased after doping with F. This result could be ascribed to the longer electron lifetime in the TiO2 films after introducing fluorine ions. Moreover, the longer electron lifetime could be explained in the IMVS part. The F-doped TiO2 (TiF4 as a doping source) was used as reference to further confirm the effect of fluorine ions. Based on these results, we further studied the performance of DSSCs after Ta/F, Nb/F, and Sb/F doping and the results are shown in Fig. S1 and Table S2†. We found that the performance of DSSCs based on Ta/F, Nb/F and Sb/F dual-doped TiO2 is considerably higher than that of DSSCs based on Ta, Nb and Sb solely doped TiO2.

The optimized molar ratios of Sn to Ti in TiO2–Sn and TiO2–Sn/F samples (Sn to Ti = 0.5:100) were chosen according to the ref. 37. The optimized molar ratio of F to Ti in TiO2–Sn/F sample was 0.75:100. TiO2–F sample (molar ratio, F to Ti = 0.75:100) was chosen as a reference.

To better understand the dynamics of electron transport/recombination in the titania films, the EIS measurements were performed over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz under an AM 1.5 solar condition (100 mW cm−2). The applied bias voltage was set to the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the DSSCs, and an AC amplitude of 5 mV was applied. Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist plots under the open-circuit condition for the DSSCs. All the spectra in Fig. 6 can be described by two typical semicircles observed in the measured frequency at photoelectrodes, which are attributed to the electrochemical reaction at the Pt counter electrode, charge transfer and recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The semicircles in the Nyquist plots corresponding to a middle-frequency area (in the 10–100 Hz range) are attributed to the electron transfer and recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The impedance spectra were fit to a transmission line model equivalent circuit, as presented in the Fig. S2.†40–43 The fitting results shown in Table 4 indicate that the electron transport resistance Rw decreases after Sn doping. Although the Rw increases after doping with F, the electron transport performance is still improved by dual-doping with Sn and F. The interfacial charge recombination resistance Rk of the F-doping cell is larger than that without F-doping, indicating a lower recombination rate than that of the sample with no F-doping.

To further confirm the synergistic effects of Sn/F dual-doping on electron transport in the TiO2 film and electron recombination between the injected electron and the redox electrolyte (I3−), we carried out IMPS/IMVS measurements. Intensity modulation photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) is employed to analyze the dynamics of electron transport in the TiO2 and the doped TiO2, and the results are shown in Fig. 7(a). The electron transport time (τd) for the pure TiO2, TiO2–Sn, TiO2–F, TiO2–Sn/F are 8.3, 5.4, 9, and 5.9 ms, respectively. The shorter transport time of the TiO2 and TiO2–Sn/F based films indicates faster electron transport rate, which is favorable for the improvement of charge-collection efficiency and photocurrent density. The IMVS shows that the lifetime or recombination time (τn) of the TiO2–Sn/F based cell is larger than that of the TiO2–Sn (Fig. 7(b)), which is in agreement with the results of EIS measurement. The charge collection efficiency (ηcc) was introduced to quantitatively analyze the effect of electron lifetime and transport time. ηcc can be calculated according to the equation: ηcc = 1 − (τd/τn). The obtained ηcc value for TiO2, TiO2–Sn, TiO2–F, and TiO2–Sn/F electrodes are 85.6%, 89.1%, 90.0%, and 93.9%, respectively. This result is in accordance with the tendency of short-circuit photocurrent density variation.

In order to identify the effect of Ti atoms partially substituted by the Sn atoms with the electronic conductance of Ti1−xSnxO2, we performed a density functional theory (DFT) study of the density of states (DOS) for our materials. The calculated band gap of TiO2 is 2.07 eV, which is lower than the experimental value of 3.2 eV.44 It is well known that the GGA method underestimates the band gap, especially for the system with strong correlations or weak coulomb screening. The band gap can be corrected to be 3.03 eV if the hybrid functional due to Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof (HSE06) with screening parameter of 0.2 is employed,45 which is nearly the same value as the experimental value. The band gap can also be corrected by the scissors operator to match with the experimental value. However, even though the correction is not made, the GGA results can still predict the trend of variation for the band gap and the Fermi level shift under different doping concentrations.
For each x value, we have considered at least four substitution structures and found that there is little difference among them. Fig. 8 shows the doping model and the DOS for Ti1−xSnxO2 with different substitution degrees. Our calculation revealed that, after Ti was substituted by Sn, the valence band maximum (VBM) remains almost unchanged and the conductance band minimum (CBM) shifts upward a little by 0.06 eV. Thus, the band gap is enlarged by 0.03–0.08 eV when the Ti atoms are substituted by the Sn atoms, consistent with previous theoretical and experimental results,46,47 which also accounts for our experimental observation that the conductance band shifts upward after Sn doping and increased Voc was obtained. The band gap enlargement is attributed to the appearance of the Sn5s and Sn5p orbitals in the CBM (the VBM is composed mainly of O2p states, and the CBM is composed mainly of Ti3d states). However, the doping level needs to be restricted as the increased lattice strain after Sn-doping would contribute to charge recombination, and a trade-off between doping concentration and photovoltaic properties is needed.36

The electronic structures of clean and F-adsorbed surfaces are also calculated, as shown in Fig. 9. From the most energy stable adsorption structure, we can see that the F atoms are bonded with the surface fivefold Ti. The bond length is 1.9 Å, and the binding energy is 1.0 eV, indicating a strong chemisorption. Compared with the clean surfaces of TiO2, the Fermi levels for (101) and (001) surfaces adsorbed with F atoms is shifted toward the valence band by 0.5 and 1.1 eV, respectively. Moreover, the band gaps are also enlarged by 0.14 eV and 0.3 eV, respectively. Combining the projected DOS (PDOS) and partial DOS, we can see that, for a clean TiO2 surface, the valence band and conductance band near the Fermi level are mainly composed of O2p and Ti3d orbitals, respectively. After the chemisorption of F atoms on the surface, the F2p orbitals also contribute to the valence band near the Fermi level (blue line in Fig. 9), and the stronger bond of Ti–F than the Ti–O will lower the energy of the electrons of the valence band, thus leading to the downward shift of the Fermi level and the enlarged band gap. As a result, the F adsorption will produce charge trapping sites on the surface and suppress the charge recombination at the interface by holding trapped electrons, thus leading to the longer electron lifetime as observed in the IMVS measurements.

Conclusions
A general dual-doping strategy was developed for TiO2 based dye-sensitized solar cells performances. Tin and fluorine dual-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were successfully prepared using a hydrothermal method. DSSCs based on Sn/F dual-doped TiO2 exhibit higher PCE (8.89%) than those for the undoped TiO2 nanoparticles and the solely Sn or F doped samples, which is attributed to the combined effect of the faster electron transportation and the longer electron lifetime in the dual-doped TiO2 film. This combined effect of dual-doping is also demonstrated to be effective for DSSCs based on Ta/F, Nb/F, and Sb/F dual-doped TiO2, and the performance of DSSCs based on such dual-doped TiO2 samples is higher than that of DSSCs based on solely doped TiO2. By employing the DFT calculations, the mechanism behind the improvement by tin and fluorine dual-doping is discussed in detail. This work may open a new method to further improve the performance of DSSCs by a metal/F dual-doping method, promoting the progress of DSSCs toward commercial applications.

Synthesis of TiO2 and the doped TiO2 nanoparticles
Both TiO2 and the doped TiO2 were synthesized using the hydrothermal method. Tetrabutyl titanate (5 mL), butanol (30 mL), acetone (5 mL), and acetic acid (5 mL) were mixed. A mixture of butanol (20 mL) and distilled water (1.5 mL) was then added to the above solution. After being stirred continuously for 0.5 h, the mixture was transferred into an autoclave for the hydrothermal process at 240 °C for 6 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the concentrated colloid contained 10–13 wt% TiO2 was obtained by rotary evaporation. For preparing Sn-doped, F-doped and the Sn/F dual-doped samples, Sn(OC4H9)4, TiF4 and Sn(OC4H9)4/TiF4 were added to the tetrabutyl titanate, respectively. The optimized Sn doping amount was chosen according to the literature.37 Molar ratio of Sn(OC4H9)4 and Ti(OC4H9)4 in all the samples was 0.5:100. The optimized molar ratio of TiF4 and Ti(OC4H9)4 of the F-doped TiO2 and Sn/F doped samples was 0.75:100.
Cell fabrication and photovoltaic measurements
TiO2 and the doped TiO2 films (ca. 11 μm) were fabricated on the FTO substrates (fluorine-doped SnO2, 7 Ω sq−1) using a doctor-blade method and the electrodes were heated at 450 °C for 30 min. After sintering, the electrodes were immersed in a dye bath containing cis-Ru(H2dcbpy)2(NCS)2 (H2dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridyl) (N3) (0.5 mM) in ethanol for 24 h when the temperature cooled to about 80 °C. The film thickness was obtained by CCD laser displacement sensor (Keyence Corporation). The redox electrolyte was a mixture of LiI (0.5 M), I2 (0.05 M), TBP (0.6 M) and HMII (0.6 M) in MPN. The counter electrode was Pt-coated FTO.
The photocurrent density–voltage (j–V) measurement was tested using a Keithley 2611 Source Meter (Keithley Instruments, Inc.). The light source was an AM 1.5 solar simulator (91160A, Newport Co.). The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The photoanode area of the DSSCs is 1 cm2. The tested solar cells were masked to a working area of 0.2 cm2.
Characterization
The crystal phase of the samples was analyzed by X-ray diffraction with Cu Kα radiation (XRD, D/MAX-2500, Rigaku Co., Japan). The accelerating voltage and the applied current were 40 kV and 150 mA, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to measure the surface elements and the chemical state. The shift in the binding energy due to relative surface charging was corrected using the C1s level at 284.8 eV as an internal standard. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution electron microscope (HRTEM) images were measured on a Tecnai G2 F20 U-TWIN transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV.
Mott–Schottky analysis was performed in a three-electrode cell in the dark. TiO2 or the doped TiO2 single films without dyes (ca. 3 μm) were used as the electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) served as the reference electrode, and platinum wire was used as the counter electrode. The active area was 0.25 cm2. TiO2 and doped TiO2 films (ca. 3 μm) adsorbed by dyes were used for the IMPS and IMVS test. IMPS and IMVS were performed using a green light emitting diode (max = 520 nm) driven by a Solartron 1255B frequency-response analyzer. The LED provided both the dc and ac components of the illumination. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were obtained under 100 mW cm−2 illuminations, using a perturbation of ±10 mV over the open-circuit potential using a Solartron 1255B frequency analyzer and a Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface system.
Calculation details
In order to model the TiO2 doped by Sn, a 4 × 2 × 2, 4 × 4 × 2, 4 × 3 × 2, 4 × 2 × 2 supercell based on the unit cell was constructed, allowing us to investigate different substitution degrees of Ti1−xSnxO2, with x = 0, x = 0.005, x = 0.01, x = 0.015, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8. To study the F atoms adsorption on the TiO2 particle's surface, the slab technique is adopted to simulate the TiO2 particles surface. Both the (101) and (001) surfaces are considered here, which are the thermodynamically stable facet (more than 90%) and the much more reactive facet, respectively. In each case, stoichiometric 2 × 2 slabs are built: the slab for the clear (101) surface consists of 18 atomic layers and a total of 72 atoms, and the slab for the clear (001) surface consists of 12 atomic layers and a total of 72 atoms. Because the exposed dangling bonds for each Ti and O atom of the surface can passivate each other, there is no need to consider surface reconstruction to satisfy the electron counting rule. A vacuum buffer space of at least 15 Å is set for slabs with adsorbed atoms. All atoms are relaxed without any constraint.
All the calculations are performed using the plane-wave projector-augmented wave method49,50 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.51,52 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)53 form of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is chosen as the exchange-correlation potential. To obtain reliable optimized structures, the maximum residual force is less than 0.01 eV Å−1 and energies are converged to within 5 × 10−6 eV per atom; the k-point mesh is set to 5 × 5 × 1 for F atoms adsorption. The k-point mesh of TiO2 doped by Sn is set to 4 × 4 × 4, 3 × 3 × 3, 3 × 3 × 3, 4 × 4 × 4 with x = 0, x = 0.005, x = 0.01, x = 0.015, respectively, to calculate electronic properties. An energy cut-off of 520 eV was used in all cases.
