    , Accepted 12th June 2023First published on 12th June 2023AbstractThe all-inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite presents promising prospects due to its suitable band gap and nonvolatile nature, while serious nonradiative recombination and unmatched energy level alignment hinder its further developments. Here, a facile and effective surface treatment strategy is proposed to modify the CsPbI3 surface with ethanolamine, leading to significantly reduced defects, and ameliorated band alignment and morphology. Consequently, a champion power conversion efficiency of 18.41% with improved stability is achieved for the inverted CsPbI3 solar cells.
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have witnessed unprecedented progress with a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25%.1,2 However, the inherent volatility of organic components in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites could threaten long-term stability issues. Alternatively, all-inorganic metal halide perovskites without volatile organic cations have attracted increasing research attention in recent years. In particular, all-inorganic cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) perovskite with a suitable bandgap (≈1.70 eV) and superior thermal stability endows great promise for future photovoltaic applications, especially as the front sub-cell absorber of tandem solar cells.3,4
Various strategies including crystallization regulation,1,5 additive engineering,6,7 and deposition technology,8,9 have been developed to vastly boost the device efficiency and stability of CsPbI3 PSCs. Although the maximum PCE has exceeded 20%,10–13 almost all of the reported highly efficient CspbI3 PSCs are based on the normal structure devices and usually involve the use of photocatalytic active TiO2 and hygroscopic dopants, which has been identified as one of the major origins for PSC degradation.14–16 In contrast, the inverted CspbI3 PSCs can refrain from the use of undesirable transport layers and also possess a compatible manufacturing process with the tandem architecture.17 Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art effort to exploit inverted structure CspbI3 PSCs has largely lagged behind the development of their counterparts.
Recent studies have demonstrated that the inverted CsPbI3 PSCs generally suffer from a large open-circuit voltage (VOC) deficit, which is significantly correlated with the detrimental nonradiative recombination of carriers and mismatched alignment of energy levels.18 Actually, the surface and grain boundaries of solution-processed polycrystalline CsPbI3 films often exhibit a high content of defects, which may induce severe charge recombination, thus leading to disappointing device VOC and PCE. Moreover, due to the soft ionic nature of CsPbI3 perovskite, the relatively weak coordination between [PbI6]4− and Cs+ is prone to generate lots of nonradiative recombination centers upon crystal destruction, thereby limiting the PSC performance.8,9,19–21 On the other hand, the energy level alignment mismatch at the interfaces of the perovskite/charge transport layers also give rise to adverse carrier accumulation and recombination, further resulting in energy loss and hysteresis issues. Consequently, several solutions have been attempted to minimize the nonradiative recombination and optimize the energy level structure to improve the inverted CsPbI3 PSC performance. Han et al. utilized the steric hindrance effect of organic terminal groups to suppress the lattice distortion and passivate the surface electronic trap states of CsPbI3, realizing a stabilized PCE of 13.2% and VOC of 1.12 V with an inverted PSC.8 Fang et al. synthesized a novel molecule to in-situ heal and protect the CsPbI3 film, and delivered an elevated efficiency of 16.67% and device stability ascribed to the effective passivation and resisted moisture intrusion.22 And they have also innovatively developed hydrolysable organic additives to fabricate inverted CsPbI3 PSCs in a wider humidity atmosphere, and promoted the PCE to over 19%.23 Recently, dialkylamine molecules have been reported as outstanding surface modifiers to reduce the trap density and optimize the band alignment, greatly improving the device VOC and PCE.24,25 Although some promising results have been obtained from the above studies, the relevant exploration to ameliorate inverted CsPbI3 PSCs is still quite limited compared with that of regular PSCs. Thus, it is of great urgency to develop new approaches to further lessen the VOC loss toward high performance inverted CsPbI3 PSCs.
Herein, we proposed a facile and effective surface modification strategy to inhibit the nonradiative recombination of charges and ameliorate the alignment of energy levels by treating the CsPbI3 films with short-chain ethanolamine (EA) molecules. Meanwhile, the crystal quality and surface morphology of CsPbI3 were improved after EA treatment. Eventually, the best-performing inverted CsPbI3 PSCs with EA modification displayed a champion PCE of 18.41% with a fill factor (FF) of 80.68% and a high VOC of 1.112 V, while the control device just obtained an inferior PCE of 12.95% with a low FF of 64.87% and a VOC of 0.991 V.
The CsPbI3 perovskite films were fabricated on a P3CT-N hole transport layer with a one-step spin-coating and annealing process. Then, the solution of EA molecules dissolved in isopropanol was deposited on the surface of CsPbI3 films, followed by a thermal treatment at 100 °C. The chemical structure and molecular simulated electrostatic potential map of EA are depicted in Fig. 1a, where we can find that two functional groups of amine (–NH2) and hydroxyl (–OH) are located at the two ends of the EA molecule. The asymmetric negative potential distribution suggests that the electron-rich regions are concentrated in the –NH2 and –OH groups, which could interact with the undercoordinated lead ions (Pb2+) or iodine vacancy to passivate the traps of perovskite via the typical Lewis acid–base reaction. Thus, we propose a hypothetical mechanism model to illustrate the passivation mechanism of EA on the CsPbI3 surface (Fig. 1a). To validate our hypothesized mechanism, the liquid state 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy was first performed to explore the interaction between the EA molecule and PbI2. As shown in Fig. 1b, the characteristic peaks at about 2.6 and 3.4 ppm are assigned to the typical hydrogen signals of –NH2 and –OH groups in pure EA, respectively. After binding the EA with PbI2, a large resonance signal shift to around 3.0 ppm is detected for both the –NH2 and –OH groups, which strongly suggests the tough coordination of two functional groups with uncoordinated Pb2+, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FITR) measurements of pure EA, and EA-PbI2 samples were conducted to further verify the interaction between EA and PbI2 (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1, ESI†). It can be found that the stretching vibration peaks of the –NH2 and –OH groups in EA at 3351.7 and 3286.1 cm−1 are shifted to 3345.8 and 3280.3 cm−1 for the EA-PbI2 sample, respectively. This can be reasonably ascribed to the chemical interaction between the electron-rich –NH2/–OH groups and PbI2. Additionally, to elucidate the change of chemical bonding state of the CsPbI3 film after EA treatment, we carried out an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The full-scan XPS spectra of pristine CsPbI3 and EA-treated CsPbI3 films are shown in Fig. S2a (ESI†). Compared with the XPS spectra of Pb 4f 5/2 and Pb 4f 7/2 core levels of CsPbI3, the peaks of EA-treated CsPbI3 both shift towards lower binding energy (from 142.68, 137.83 to 142.48, 137.63 eV, respectively, Fig. 1d). And the peaks of I 3d also shift towards lower binding energy with the modification of EA (Fig. S2c, ESI†). Meanwhile, the peaks of N 1s and O 1s (located at 398.93 and 531.78eV, respectively) corresponding to the characteristic elements from the EA molecule are only observed in the EA-treated CsPbI3 film, confirming the existence of EA on the perovskite surface (Fig. 1e and Fig. S2d, ESI†). The above results clearly indicate the effective interaction between the EA modifier and CsPbI3, which may relate to defect passivation effects.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was tested to investigate the crystal quality of the CsPbI3 films with or without EA treatment. As shown in Fig. 1f, both the films present a similar diffraction pattern with peaks at 14.8° and 29.1° assigned to the (110) and (220) crystal planes of the cubic CsPbI3 perovskite phase, respectively. Of note, the crystal peak intensity slightly increases for the EA-treated CsPbI3 film, indicating enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite film after surface modification with EA. The XRD patterns of the CsPbI3 film treated with various concentrations of EA are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), and the film with 2 mg mL−1 EA exhibits the highest diffraction intensity. However, when we increase the concentration of EA to above 4 mg mL−1, the characteristic peak of PbI2 appears at 11.8°, which means that excessive EA will destroy the crystal structure of CsPbI3.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to visualize the surface morphology of CsPbI3 films. From the AFM height images shown in Fig. 2a and b, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is found to decrease from 13.2 nm for the pristine CsPbI3 film to 8.9 nm for the EA-treated film, implying a uniform and smoother film surface for interfacial contact. Meanwhile, as evidenced by the top-view SEM images of the corresponding films (Fig. 2c and d and Fig. S4, ESI†), both CsPbI3 films exhibit relatively compact surfaces with few pinholes. However, excessive EA (8 mg mL−1) can damage the perovskite film while generating lots of pinholes (Fig. S5, ESI†), which is in line with previous XRD results.

To investigate the carrier dynamics of the CsPbI3 films, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were obtained. The PL intensity of the EA-treated film is apparently higher than that of the control one, suggesting the suppression of carrier non-radiative recombination after EA modification (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b displays the TRPL curves of the perovskite films, and the corresponding carrier lifetime of the EA-treated film is significantly increased compared to the control film, profiting from the ameliorated crystallization and effective defect passivation. In addition, we measured the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectrum of the films, and found that the absorption intensity of the EA-treated film is enhanced compared to that of the control film below 545 nm, as shown in Fig. 3c. Meanwhile, the absorption edges of both films are nearly identical, indicating the almost unchanged optical band gap (Eg) of CsPbI3 after EA treatment. To unveil the surface band structure changes of the CsPbI3 films, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) characterizations were examined. Fig. 3d and e presents the binding energy cutoff and onset of the CsPbI3 films, from which the valence band maximum (VBM) values can be calculated. By combining the UPS parameters and the Eg, which is estimated to be 1.68 eV, the VBM and conduction band minimum (CBM) of the control film are calculated to be −5.42 and −3.74 eV, respectively, while the values of −5.61 and −3.93 eV are obtained for the EA-treated CsPbI3 film. The summarized energy level diagram is depicted in Fig. 3f. Encouragingly, the energy level difference of the CBM between the CsPbI3 and PCBM is decreased after EA treatment, which means that the Schottky barrier is reduced. The lower Schottky barrier is beneficial to facilitate the extraction of charge carriers and reduce recombination loss at the interfaces, resulting in superior device VOC and PCE.

The p–i–n PSCs with inverted architecture of FTO/P3CT-N/CsPbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag were fabricated to assess the effect of EA surface treatment on photovoltaic performance, as shown in Fig. 4a. The typical current density-voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs with various concentrations (0, 0.5, 2 and 4 mg mL−1) of EA were recorded under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (Fig. S6, ESI†). Clearly, the device PCEs have been significantly improved when treating the CsPbI3 surface with EA, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Fig. S7 and Table S1 (ESI†). In particular, the control device without EA treatment just yields a moderate PCE of 12.95%, with poor VOC of 0.991 V, JSC of 20.14 mA cm−1, and FF of 64.87%, respectively. The relatively low VOC of the control PSC implies that a huge voltage deficit exists at the interfaces between the CsPbI3 and charge transport layers owing to the considerable surface defects and unmatched energy levels. In parallel, the inverted PSC treated with 2 mg mL−1 EA delivers a champion PCE of 18.41%, with enhanced VOC of 1.112 V, JSC of 20.51 mA cm−1, and outstanding FF of 80.68%. Moreover, the current hysteresis effect of the best-performing devices was monitored, as shown in Fig. 4b. Obviously, a serious hysteresis behaviour is observed in the control PSC, while only slight hysteresis can be detected in the EA-treated PSC, and the corresponding data from forward/reverse scanning directions are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs were tested in Fig. 4c. An integrated JSC of 20.12 mA cm−1 from the EA-treated device matches well with the value extracted from the J–V curve within 3% deviation, whereas the control PSC exhibits an integrated JSC of 19.53 mA cm−2.

To reveal the underlying mechanism behind the device performance improvement deriving from the EA treatment, the charge carrier behaviours in intact devices were systematically studied. Transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were first conducted, as depicted in Fig. 4d and Fig. S8 (ESI†). With the EA treatment, a prolonged decay time of TPV can be detected, indicating the effective suppression of nonradiative recombination. Meanwhile, the shortened TPC decay time of the EA-treated PSC demonstrates the faster carrier extraction and transportation. Next, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed to further probe the interfacial charge transfer and recombination issues. From the fitted Nyquist plots of CsPbI3 PSCs in Fig. 4e and Table S3 (ESI†), the transport resistance (Rtr) and the recombination resistance (Rrec) are identified to be 244.6 and 1857 Ω for the control PSC, and 77.4 and 3992 Ω for the EA-treated PSC, respectively. The smaller Rtr and higher Rrec of the EA-treated PSC further confirm the rapid charge transfer and repressed carrier recombination, which is mainly ascribed to the decreased trap density and the ameliorated band alignments.
The dark J–V curves of the PSCs are illustrated in Fig. S9 (ESI†), where a smaller leakage current is observed for the EA-treated device than the control one, indicating that the EA modification can greatly lessen the current leakage and thus benefit the device performance. Moreover, hole-only devices were fabricated to estimate the trap density using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. By measuring the dark J–V curves of the devices, we could extract the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), which is able to calculate the trap density (Nt) according to the classic equation. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the VTFL values are determined to be 0.61 and 0.47 V for the control and EA-treated devices, respectively. Notably, the trap states of the EA-treated device were greatly decreased compared to the control device. To evaluate the long-term stability of the unencapsulated CsPbI3 PSCs, we tracked their performance upon storage under dim light conditions in a glovebox. As shown in Fig. 4f, the EA-treated PSC presents an excellent storage stability, maintaining 95% of its initial PCE after 1152 h aging, while the control device suffered a large drop in efficiency with retaining about 85%. The improved long-term stability of the EA-treated device should be attributed to the effective defect passivation and ameliorated crystal quality.
In summary, we have successfully developed a facile and effective surface modification strategy to treat the CsPbI3 film with EA, from which the functional groups could interact with the undercoordinated Pb2+ to passivate the traps of the perovskite via the Lewis acid–base reaction. Moreover, the EA treatment can also ameliorate the film crystallinity, and alignment of energy levels. Thus, the suppressed nonradiative recombination and matched band alignment greatly mitigate the voltage loss. Consequently, the EA-treated inverted CsPbI3 device yielded a champion PCE of 18.41% with a VOC of 1.112 V, while the control PSC just achieved a poor PCE of 12.95% with a low VOC of 0.991 V. This work highlights the importance of surface treatment on perovskite films, and provides an efficient approach to construct high-performance inverted inorganic PSCs.
