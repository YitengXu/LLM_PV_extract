    , Accepted 12th November 2022First published on 7th December 2022AbstractTo resolve the health and environmental issues related to the increase in diabetes and environmental pollution, development of an efficient and bifunctional catalyst is urgently required. For this prospective, the molybdenum disulfide–zinc oxide (MoS2-ZnO) heterostructure has been scarcely investigated as a bifunctional catalyst. In this work, a heterostructured MoS2-ZnO catalyst was synthesized and its electrocatalytic and photocatalytic properties were investigated. The heterostructure based modified glassy carbon electrode (MoS2-ZnO/GCE) exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic properties for the detection of glucose. The electrode shows a reproducible sensitivity of 639.12 μA μM−1 cm−2 in a wide linear detection range from 0.025 to 6000 μM. Moreover, the electrode exhibits a low detection limit of ∼0.025 μM, excellent selectivity and long-term stability. In addition, the heterostructured MoS2-ZnO shows excellent photocatalytic properties for the degradation of various toxic organic dyes i.e. rhodamine B (RhB), methyl blue (MB) and sandoz yellow (SY) under UV irradiation. The heterostructure demonstrates ∼97% degradation of MB, ∼78% of RhB and ∼81% of SY within 18 min of exposure. The photocatalytic efficiency of the heterostructure was found to be twice those of pristine MoS2 and ZnO, respectively. Our results reveal that the MoS2-ZnO catalyst possesses binary properties by providing a novel platform for the remediation of environmental as well as health issues.
1. Introduction
Progress in the development and integration of chip-based high-performance sensing platforms for rapid and accurate monitoring of multiple disease biomarkers is critically desirable. For instance, diabetes mellitus is a metabolic condition that causes serious disorders in the human body due to an elevated concentration of glucose in human blood.1 Notably, electrochemical sensors for glucose detection are well known for their durability, ease of scaling and improved detection limits at ultra-low concentrations.2,3 Additionally, they have been employed in biofluid matrices with high turbidity and in the presence of absorbing and fluorescing species simultaneously.4 On the other hand, pollution detection is crucial for major worldwide environmental challenges.5 The toxic pollutants produced by increased industrialization, particularly released through textile effluents, petroleum refining and leather tanneries are on the rise and are harmful to the aquatic environment and human health.6 Photocatalysis has significant potential for removing dyes from wastewater as an environmentally benign and sustainable approach.7 Recently, a breakthrough in the advancement of nanotechnology aided the design of advanced electrocatalysts with superior catalytic activity, thermal stability, sensing properties and biocompatibility.8–12
The development of promising two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) comprising a S–Mo–S triple-layered structure has sparked research interest due to its exceptional optical absorption, tunable band gap (1.29–1.9 eV), photoinduced catalyzing ability and fast charge carrier dynamics.13–15 Besides this, MoS2 based nanostructures offer unique prospects for biosensing and photocatalytic applications on account of the high surface to volume ratio, large basal-plane area, outstanding adsorption performance and easy functionalization with various functional groups.16–19 Nevertheless, the biological and photocatalytic activities of MoS2 are severely impeded by the low intrinsic conductivity, less abundant active sites and rapid recombination rate due to which the photogenerated electron–hole pairs reside in the same spatial positions leading to inefficient charge separation.20–22 Various approaches have been proposed to improve and accelerate the electrochemical and photocatalytic activities of MoS2, such as, defect engineering23 (activation of the basal plane sites by sulfur vacancies), strain engineering,24 phase engineering25 (conversion of stable semiconducting 2H-MoS2 into metallic 1T-MoS2 by wet chemistry), alloy engineering26 (controlling the chemical composition either in the form of ternary alloys or substitutional doping in the crystal lattice), decoration of metal nanoparticles,27 and so on. Interestingly, integrating dissimilar dimensional materials,28 particularly 1D-materials with 2D-MoS2 has been revealed as an effective strategy to enhance the biosensing and photocatalytic applications, respectively. Incorporation of 1D-metal oxides, especially zinc oxide (ZnO) with a 2D-MoS2 lattice provides multiple functionalities for superior characteristics compared to individual components.29,30 Also, the lattice constant of MoS2 (0.319 nm) remarkably matches with that of ZnO (0.325 nm) which provides considerable advantage in the construction of MoS2-ZnO heterostructures.31,32 Being a promising co-catalyst material, semiconducting ZnO exhibits an exceptional photoelectric effect and strong chemical stability, leading to promising healthcare applications.33–35 Integration of ZnO can tune the properties of MoS2 more dramatically which leads to favorable energy band alignment with a type-II heterostructure resulting in effective electron–hole pair separation and accelerated the charge transport process for electrochemical sensing and biosensing.36,37 The MoS2-ZnO heterostructure facilitates the strongest optical-absorption in the visible range, implying its application in photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices.38,39 Notably, the synergistic adsorption of two different Egap semiconductors extends the light-harvesting span for photocatalytic energy conversion and solar applications.40 Thus, it is required to fabricate a highly active and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst as a sensing platform for the rapid detection of biomolecules and degradation of hazardous pollutants.
Previously, various heterostructure architectures have been produced for photocatalytic applications i.e. MoS2/ZnO particles,41 loading of MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of ZnO nanorods,42 MoS2-ZnO heterostructure nanorods,43 and anchoring of ZnO nanoparticles on MoS2 nanosheets.44 Similarly, prototypes of solar cells and self-powered photodetectors have been developed based on the coupling of ZnO nanowires (NW) and 2D MoS2 nanosheets (NS) with either p–n-type or n–p-type heterojunction nanostructures.45
Yet, these works suffer from the low degradation efficiency of pollutants or longer time to degrade. Similarly, most of the MoS2 based electrochemical sensors displayed low sensitivity and poor detection limit towards various analytes.46,47 Until now, the sensing performance of the MoS2-ZnO heterostructure for glucose has not been explored. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate the role of MoS2-ZnO as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in order to achieve excellent outcomes in terms of biosensor accuracy and reproducibility as well photocatalyst efficiency.
Herein, we report the synthesis of a bifunctional heterostructure based on the MoS2-ZnO electrocatalyst using a facile hydrothermal method. Hydrothermal synthesis facilitates the production of high purity materials with a better yield. The MoS2-ZnO heterostructure based modified glassy carbon electrode demonstrates outstanding electrochemical sensing characteristics towards glucose detection. The fabricated biosensor displayed a superior figure of merit i.e. a reproducible sensitivity of 639.12 μA μM−1 cm−2, a low detection limit of ∼0.025 μM, excellent selectivity and long-term stability. Moreover, the MoS2-ZnO electrocatalyst exhibits superior photocatalytic capabilities for the degradation of several hazardous organic dyes such as rhodamine B (RhB), methyl blue (MB) and sandoz yellow (SY) under UV conditions. Based on the experimental findings, our bifunctional heterostructure material is highly suitable for wastewater treatment and biomedical applications.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural, morphological and compositional analysis
X-Ray diffraction was carried out at room temperature to investigate the purity and the crystalline structure of MoS2 and the MoS2-ZnO heterostructure. Fig. 1a illustrates the XRD patterns of synthesized pristine MoS2 and the MoS2-ZnO heterostructure. It can be clearly observed that the peaks shown in Fig. 1a (blue) can be indexed to the hexagonal phase (2H) of MoS2. The diffraction peaks can be well assigned to the (002), (100), (103) and (110) planes of 2H-MoS2 at 2θ ∼ 13.43°, 33.14°, 37.73°, and 59.19° and matches well with JCPDs card No. 37-1492. The strongest peak located at 2θ = 13.43° (002) signifies MoS2 growth along the c-axis with a well-stacked layered structure.48 Moreover, the purity of the crystalline MoS2 nanostructure can also be ascertained with the absence of any impurity peak. Fig. 1a (red curve) presents the XRD pattern of the MoS2-ZnO heterostructure. The detected diffraction peaks of ZnO are distinct at 2θ ∼ 31.61° (100), 34.39° (002), 36.12° (101), 47.59° (102), 56.54° (110) and 62.88° (103) and confirm the wurtzite structure (JCPDs card No. 36-1451).49 The coexistence of individual MoS2 and ZnO components is revealed by different lattice planes corresponding to the nanostructured MoS2 and ZnO, respectively.50 Moreover, the hexagonal properties as well as the crystallinity of the ingredients within the heterostructure are retained.

To further characterize the quality of the synthesized samples, Raman spectroscopy was employed in order to probe the vibrational properties of the material. The Raman spectra of pristine MoS2, ZnO and the MoS2-ZnO heterostructure are illustrated in Fig. 1b. As observed, the spectrum of MoS2 exhibits characteristics Raman modes of E12g and A1g (blue). The mode E12g arises from the in-plane vibration of the S–Mo–S layer whereas A1g corresponds to the out-of-plane vibration of S-atoms, respectively.51 The respective positions of E12g and A1g modes are located at 382.7 and 407.13 cm−1 with a frequency difference of ∼23.4 cm−1 indicating the few layered nature of the synthesized 2H-MoS2 sample.52Fig. 1b (black) shows a typical Raman active mode of bulk nanostructured ZnO at 438 cm−1 assigned as the vibration mode of Ehigh2 signifying the band characteristics of the wurtzite phase. Furthermore, an additional low intensity band located at 356.9 cm−1 is referred to as 2E2 (m) presenting the vibration mode due to the multiple-phonon scattering processes.53 In the case of the MoS2-ZnO heterostructure (red curve), all the corresponding modes of MoS2 and ZnO are prominent.54 The distinct E12g and A1g modes are positioned at 381.75 and 405.73 cm−1 with a separation of ∼24 cm−1 indicating multilayered MoS2. Similarly, the wurtzite structure of ZnO is also preserved. Thus, the presence of Raman modes of MoS2 and ZnO confirms the formation of the MoS2-ZnO heterostructure.
The FESEM image of the synthesized MoS2 is presented in Fig. S1(a) (ESI†) and clearly reveals the highly dense flower-like structures with multiple nanosheets interconnected to each other. The corresponding EDX confirms the formation of MoS2 (Fig. S1(b), ESI†). The FESEM image of MoS2-ZnO heterostructures is displayed in Fig. 2a. Notably, the morphology of MoS2 nanoflowers has been altered to wrapped and curved nanosheets due to the interaction with ZnO. Moreover, it indicates that ZnO is evenly dispersed on MoS2 nanosheets. For detailed structural analysis of the MoS2-ZnO heterostructure, TEM and HRTEM were employed. Fig. 2(b) and Fig. S1(c) (ESI†) highlight the TEM image of the hybrid MoS2-ZnO heterostructure. The EDX spectrum consists of Zn, Mo, O and S peaks which further confirm the formation of heterostructures (Fig. S1(d), ESI†). Fig. 2(c) presents the HRTEM image illustrating the formation of a polycrystalline structure. The arrows show the formation of defects during the synthesis of the heterostructure. Fig. 2(d and e) present the magnified HRTEM image taken from two different areas indicated by rectangles in Fig. 2(c).

Fig. 2(d and e) show the magnified HRTEM image taken from two different areas indicated by rectangles in Fig. 2(c) in order to demonstrate the MoS2 and ZnO nano-crystalline structure respectively. The interplanar distance “d” for one set of crystal planes was calculated and found to be ∼0.261 nm corresponding to the (002) plane of hexagonal ZnO, as shown in Fig. 2(d).55 These calculated lattice spacings of 0.274 nm and 0.615 nm are ascribed to the (100) and (002) planes of MoS2 respectively.56 Moreover, the curly structure of MoS2-ZnO with defects provides more active sites, which is advantageous for both photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activities.
It has been reported that nanostructures with a high specific surface area are highly potential candidates for electrochemical reactions. In this regard, the specific surface area of the products was investigated by measuring the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of pure ZnO and MoS2 and the MoS2-ZnO heterostructure. It can clearly be observed that the isotherm of the heterostructure shows a wide hysteresis loop. The corresponding BET specific surface area of MoS2-ZnO was measured as 124.3 m2 g−1 which is larger than that of MoS2 (97.4 m2 g−1) and ZnO (56.2 m2 g−1). These results show that the surface area of MoS2-ZnO increases with the addition of ZnO due to the formation of more active sites in the product.
Since the surface atoms play a significant role in the electrocatalytic properties of materials, XPS studies were performed to investigate the oxidation states and the surface chemical compositions of all the elements in the heterostructure. Fig. 3(a) presents the high resolution spectrum of Mo 3d comprising four binding energy peaks. The deconvoluted Mo 3d peaks located at 231.39 and 228.24 eV can be attributed to the electronic states of Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2 respectively and confirm the dominance of the Mo4+ state in the heterostructure. The characteristic peak of Mo6+ at 235.3 eV is attributed to the combination of Mo with O in ZnO during the formation of the MoS2-ZnO heterostructure.57 The small peak located at 225.23 eV is associated with the S 2s orbital of sulfide ions. The oxidation states of S can be clearly observed by the deconvolution of S 2p as shown in Fig. 3(b). The double spectral peaks at 162.35 and 161.12 eV corresponding to S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 signify the −2 oxidation state of S in the heterostructure. The slight shift in binding energy indicates the electron coupling between ZnO and MoS2, which ultimately promotes the charge transfer during the catalytic reaction.58 The double spectral binding energy peaks of Zn 2p at 1023 and 1047 eV are attributed to the electronic states of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 respectively as displayed in Fig. 3(c). The binding energy difference between two peaks is slightly higher as compared to previous reports,59 which is due to the interactions between ZnO andMoS2 in the heterostructure. Fig. 3(d) shows that the O 1s binding energy peak which is deconvoluted into three peaks located at 533.85, 532.43 and 531.78 eV, respectively. The peak at 531.78 eV is associated with lattice O incorporated into MoS2 during preparation as well as the contribution of ZnO. The binding energy peak at 532.3 eV is attributed to the surface adsorbed oxygen (–OH) on the surface of the catalyst. The third binding energy peak at 533.6 eV is characteristic of oxygen vacancies in ZnO.60

UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was used to investigate the photoabsorption tendency of synthesized pristine MoS2, ZnO and the MoS2-ZnO heterostructure (Fig. S3a–c, ESI†). The bandgap was calculated using Tauc's relation:61αhν = A(hν − Ebg)nwhere α, h, ν, A, and Ebg signify the absorption coefficient, Planck constant, frequency of light, proportionality constant, and energy band gap, respectively. The estimated bandgap of MoS2, ZnO and MoS2-ZnO heterostructures via Tauc plot are 1.788, 3.230 and 2.207 eV respectively.62,63 Clearly, pristine ZnO exhibits strong absorption ranging from 300 to 400 nm (UV region)33 and pristine MoS2 shows absorption in the range of 600–700 nm (visible region).64 The incorporation of ZnO to MoS2 results in the strongest optical-absorption in the wavelength range of 500 to 600 nm, which indicates that more visible light can be collected, implying better photovoltaic and photocatalytic performance. The addition of MoS2 causes a considerable increase in the light responsiveness of ZnO as well as a decrease in the forbidden bandwidth.
3.2 Electrochemical detection of glucose

3.2.1 Cyclic voltammetry. 
The electrochemical performance of ZnO/GC, MoS2/GC and MoS2-ZnO/GC electrodes was investigated by measuring their CV curves in the potential range of +0.8 to −0.5 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The typical comparative CV scans of blank GC, ZnO/GC, MoS2/GC and MoS2-ZnO/GC electrodes are shown in Fig. 4(a). The blank GC electrode shows a low current without any definite redox peak. In the case of the ZnO/GC electrode, a well-defined pair of redox peaks at 0.2 V and −0.36 V is observed. In comparison, the MoS2/GC electrode shows an enhanced oxidation peak at −0.34 V along with a reduction peak at −0.09 V. On the other hand, a tremendous increase in the redox peak current is observed in the MoS2-ZnO/GC electrode with a slight shift in peak potential. Such a higher increase in the redox peak current can be attributed to the synergistic effects of both ZnO and MoS2 structures and thus provide an efficient sensing platform. The MoS2-ZnO/GC electrode was further evaluated with the addition of different glucose concentrations over a range of 10 to 500 μM. A significant increase was examined in the redox peak current by increasing glucose concentration as shown in Fig. S4(a) (ESI†). The effect of the potential scan rate on the oxidation and reduction peak current of the MoS2-ZnO/GC electrode was also investigated in the presence of 100 μM glucose as shown in Fig. S4(b) (ESI†). It can be seen that the oxidation and reduction current increases on increasing the scan rate in the range of 10 to 90 mV s−1. The linear fitting of the redox peak current w.r.t the scan rate is presented in Fig. S4(c) (ESI†) and illustrates a linear dependence of the oxidation and reduction peak current on the scan rate. This indicates that the glucose is oxidized at the surface of the electrode by an adsorption controlled process.

3.3 Performance of the MoS2-ZnO/GC electrode for glucose detection

3.3.1 Amperometric measurements. 
The typical comparative amperometric response of ZnO/GC, MoS2/GC and MoS2-ZnO/GC electrodes towards the successive addition of various concentrations of glucose at −0.38 V is presented in Fig. 4(b). It can be found that the MoS2-ZnO/GC electrode exhibits a rapid and sensitive response to the increase in glucose concentrations in comparison with ZnO/GC and MoS2/GC electrodes. The response current of the MoS2-ZnO/GC electrode is found to be 3 times higher than that of ZnO/GC and MoS2/GC electrodes. The MoS2-ZnO/GC electrode attained 96% steady state current within less than 3 s. This indicates the enhanced electrocatalytic activity and fast electron exchange behavior of the fabricated electrode towards glucose. The corresponding calibration plots are shown in Fig. 4(c). It is clearly seen that the response current increases linearly with the increase in the glucose concentration. The MoS2-ZnO/GC electrode shows an improved sensitivity of 639.12 μA μM−1 cm−2 in a wide linear range from 0.025 to 6000 μM as compared to 296.44 and 139.57 μA μM−1 cm−2 for MoS2/GC and ZnO/GC electrodes, respectively. Moreover, the enhanced sensitivity of the MoS2-ZnO/GC electrode is also found to be higher than the previously reported electrode, as shown in Table 1. The higher sensitivity of the MoS2-ZnO/GC electrode is considered due to the increase in more active sites and synergy of both materials. The LOD of the MoS2-ZnO/GC electrode was also determined by establishing the lowest concentration of glucose at which the increase in current above the baseline is reliably and clearly obtained. Fig. 4(d) shows the amperometric response of the electrode by the addition of low concentrations of glucose. The electrode shows a clear and noticeable increase in the response current on the addition of glucose at a concentration as low as 0.025 μM.

To explore the electrochemical kinetic behaviors and charge transfer resistance of the fabricated electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been employed. The Nyquist plots of pristine MoS2 and MoS2-ZnO are shown in Fig. 4(e). The plots depict a depressed semicircle in the high frequency region and the diameter of the semicircle is used to calculate the charge transfer resistance (Rct) between the electrode material and the electrolyte. In the medium frequency region, an approximately 45° inclined line presents the Warburg impedance (ZW). As illustrated, the MoS2-ZnO electrode shows a considerable decrease in the semicircle, suggesting a low charge transfer resistance and the fastest transport during the electrochemical process. The results are best fitted using the equivalent circuit model as presented in the inset of Fig. 4(e). The EIS fitting parameters for the two electrodes are presented in Table S2 (ESI†).

3.4 Factors affecting the performance of the MoS2-ZnO/GC biosensor

3.4.1 Selectivity. 
It is well identified that some electroactive species in human blood serum could influence the performance of a biosensor; therefore, the anti-interference capability of the biosensor is examining by intentionally adding electroactive species such as ascorbic acid (AA), L-cystine (L-cys), urea and cholesterol. These species are added into a constantly stirred 0.1 MPB solution during the measurement of amperometric response at an applied potential of −0.38 V with a scan rate of 50 mV s. The influence of these species on the detection of glucose at the electrode is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). As observed, the electrode shows a very rapid and significant response upon the addition of glucose. In contrast, a small increment in the current of about 4% is observed with the addition of AA and L-Cys. In addition, the presence of cholesterol and urea shows no noticeable effect on the biosensor. These findings demonstrate that the constructed biosensor has good selectivity.


3.4.2 Stability. 
The steadiness in the efficiency of the electrode was also examined by measuring its current responses after every 20 days as shown in Fig. S6(a) (ESI†). As observed, the electrode displays good response in the presence of 100 μM glucose over a period of 180 days. The efficiency of the biosensor retains 92% of its initial response, demonstrating the high efficiency of the biosensor after 180 days. The excellent stable performance of the electrode may be due to the stable morphology and structure of MoS2-ZnO as shown in Fig. 2(a).


3.4.3 Reproducibility. 
In order to determine the reproducibility of the electrode, the current response was measured repeatedly for 5 cycles under the same experimental conditions. According to Fig. S6(b) (ESI†), the electrode demonstrates the same current response in each cycle. The catalytic efficiency of the electrode is negligibly decreased within 5 cycles. This repeatable behavior of the electrode is attributed to the stable structure of MoS2-ZnO. This result further strengthens the hypothesis that the non-enzymatic sensor can be employed repeatedly without deteriorating its catalytic activity.


3.4.4 pH. 
One of the crucial factors that can affect biosensor performance of the MoS2-ZnO electrode is the pH of the electrolyte. The pH of the electrolyte was chosen to be between 4 and 8 to cover acidic and basic ranges due to the amphoteric nature of ZnO. The current response of the glucose biosensor steadily increases with the subsequent increase in the pH of the electrolyte as shown in Fig. S6(c) (ESI†). Clearly, the peak potential (Ep) switched to a negative value with the increase of pH. The plot of Epvs. pH for glucose revealed a linear relationship given in the inset of Fig. S6(c) (ESI†).


3.4.5 Real sample measurements. 
The practical application feasibility of the prepared MoS2-ZnO electrode was investigated by measuring glucose in human blood serum using the standard addition method. The samples were collected from 3 different volunteers. All the serum samples were spiked with different concentrations of glucose, as shown in Fig. S6(d) and Table S1 (ESI†). It can be seen that the proposed biosensor exhibits good recovery. The recovery range is found to be 94.1–96.8% and confirms that the proposed biosensor works very precisely. The measured glucose concentrations are very close to the values measured using a commercial glucometer. These results demonstrate that the proposed biosensor is quite beneficial for clinical applications.

3.5 Photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes
The photocatalytic activity of the heterostructured MoS2-ZnO catalyst was evaluated by the degradation of three different well-known commercially used dyes including MB, RhB and SY under UV-irradiation. These dyes are considered as major pollutants of the textile industry. The degradation of these dyes was monitored by recording the absorption spectra of each dye at different intervals of time. Fig. 5(a) and Fig. S7 (ESI†) depict the series of UV-vis absorbance spectra of aqueous solutions of MB, RhB and SY in the presence of 20 mg of the heterostructured MoS2-ZnO catalyst at regular intervals of time. The characteristic absorption peaks are observed at 675, 560 and 425 nm for MB, RhB and SY, respectively. It can be seen that the absorption decreases with the increase in exposure time and complete decomposition occurs in 18 min for MB, RhB and SY, respectively. The photocatalytic reaction in MB is observed to be quite fast as compared to the RhB and SY. This confirms that the MoS2-ZnO catalyst is highly efficient for the degradation of organic dyes. In comparison, the photocatalytic performance of pristine MoS2 and ZnO was also performed for the degradation of MB under the same experimental conditions. Fig. S8(a and b) (ESI†) demonstrate a series of absorption spectra of MB in the presence of 20 mg of pristine MoS2 and ZnO, respectively. It is clearly seen that the degradation of MB aqueous solution is very slow as compared with the MoS2-ZnO catalyst.

The degradation kinetics of the dyes was examined by the change in their concentration. Fig. 5(b and c) show the Ct/C0vs. t and ln(Ct/C0) vs. t plots for all the three dyes in the absence and presence of different catalysts. Irradiation in the absence of the catalyst did not show any significant change in the concentration of all dyes, while pristine MoS2 and ZnO show observable activity in MB but with slow kinetics. In contrast, heterostructured MoS2-ZnO exhibits a significant synergistic effect as the photocatalyst. To quantitatively assess the photocatalytic activity for the synthesized samples, the Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic equation's first order kinetic model was applied.76 To ascertain the catalytic effectiveness of the synthesized heterostructured MoS2-ZnO, the appropriate first order rate constants (k) were calculated using the following equation:ln(Ct/C0) = −ktwhere C0 and Ct are the initial and reaction concentrations of dyes at time (t). Table S3 (ESI†) shows a comparison of the calculated k values for the degradation of dyes in the presence of MoS2-ZnO respectively.

Fig. 5(d) shows the percent degradation efficiency plots and clearly demonstrates the enhanced degradation efficiency of the MoS2-ZnO heterostructure as compared to pristine MoS2 and ZnO nanostructures. The degradation efficiency of MB reaches up to ∼97% in just 18 min while those of RhB and SY reach up to ∼78.4 and 81.2% respectively within the same period. The performance of the catalyst is well understood from the different parameters, as shown in Table 2. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of the catalyst is also compared with the reported literature (Table 2). It can be observed that our catalyst exhibits the best catalytic activity.

Moreover, the stability of the MoS2-ZnO photocatalyst was also measured for three cycles of operation, Fig. 5(e) illustrates the degradation curve of MB in the presence of the catalyst for five cycles. It can be clearly seen that the photocatalyst is very stable and the efficiency remains constant after three cycles. These results illustrate that the prepared catalyst is very effective and can be reused. The morphology and structure of the catalyst were also observed after three cycles, as shown in Fig. S9(a and b) (ESI†). It can be observed that the catalyst does not show any significant change and preserve its morphology. The improved efficiencies may be because structural defects87,88 in the heterostructure provide more trapping sites for the electrons and delay the recombination process of electron (e−)–hole (h+) pairs and ultimately trigger the degradation of organic dyes.89 The wrapped and curved nanosheets provide a large surface area and interspaces which is very suitable for an efficient catalytic reaction. The interaction between MoS2 nanosheets and ZnO induces charge transfer from ZnO to MoS2 and increases the efficiency of charge separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a novel MoS2-ZnO catalyst was successfully developed and found to be bifunctional. It has been found that tailoring the band gap and generation of active sites play an important role in the improvement of catalyst efficiency. As a non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor, the MoS2-ZnO/GCE-based electrode is found to be highly sensitive for the detection of glucose with an enhanced sensitivity of 639.12 μA μM−1 cm−2, excellent selectivity and reliable stability. In addition, the electrode also shows a low detection limit of 0.025 μM with a wide linear range, which makes it suitable for practical applications. Moreover, the binary catalyst is found to be very efficient for the degradation of toxic dyes. The improved efficiency of the binary catalyst is considered to be due to the change in the band gap, generation of active sites and synergistic effects of MoS2 and ZnO, respectively. Hence, these results demonstrate that the bifunctional catalyst can be utilized for medical and environmental applications.
