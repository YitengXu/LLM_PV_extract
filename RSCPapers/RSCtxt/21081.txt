    , Accepted 9th July 2020First published on 14th July 2020AbstractLow-cost feedstocks and rationally designed structures are the keys to determining the lithium-storage performance and practical applications of Si-based anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, we employ low-cost micro-sized kerf-loss silicon (KL-Si) as the cheap feedstock and melamine resin as the carbon source to prepare a hollow-structured Si@void@C composite. The naturally formed SiOx film and the organic layer on the surface of KL-Si during the diamond wire slicing process serve as a natural sacrificial double template to create voids between the Si core and a melamine resin-derived carbon coating. The as-prepared hollow-structured Si@void@C composite anode delivers 1164.4 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 300 cycles with a retained capacity of 927 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 3 A g−1. The full cell with the prelithiated Si@void@C anode and a Li(Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2)O2 cathode boasts a high a capacity retention of 81.5% after 150 cycles. This paper presents a straightforward approach to converting low-cost KL-Si waste to value-added LIB anodes, enabling the full utilization of the Si feedstock in the photovoltaic industry.
1. Introduction
Silicon (Si) has been considered one of the most promising lithium-ion battery (LIB) anodes because of its high theoretical capacity (3579 mA h g−1, Li15Si4), earth abundance, low working voltage (∼0.4 V vs. Li/Li+), and environmental benignity.1–3 However, the commercial application of Si anodes in the current LIBs is hindered by the rapid capacity fading resulting from the low intrinsic electrical conductivity and the dramatic volume changes (∼300%) of Si associated with the alloying/dealloying reactions with Li. Much effort has been made to accommodate the volume change of Si and then release the tensile strength caused by the volume expansion.4,5 The use of nano-structured Si materials is one of the most effective strategies to overcome the pulverization of the Si particles caused by the volume expansion and contraction of the Si anode. For example, Si nanowires,6 Si nanotubes,7 Si nanospheres,8etc. have been intensively researched. However, the cost of Si nanomaterials is still too high for their use in large-scale preparation.9,10 Hence, a low-cost and high-performance Si anode is urgently needed to meet the demand of the LIB market.
More than 95% of solar cells are made of Si, including polycrystalline and single-crystal Si solar cells. The Si-based solar cell market consumes 176640 tons of Si per year, and the consumption of Si will continue to increase in the near future.11,12 As we know, the Si wafers used for solar cells are made from Si ingots by wire cutting in which process ∼50% of the costly Si ingot is converted to kerf-loss Si (KL-Si) waste, meaning that around 88320 tons of KL-Si are produced as waste.13,14 With the increasing demand for Si solar cells, the recycling of micro-sized KL-Si waste has attracted much attention from the viewpoint of cleaner production and material sustainability. Many methods have been employed to recover KL-Si such as thermal plasma melting15 and high-temperature inductive melting.16 These methods aim to convert KL-Si to high-purity Si ingots that can be reused for producing Si wafers. However, laborious processes are needed to remove the impurities that are introduced during the cutting process. More importantly, the particle size of KL-Si is around ∼1 μm, and a thick oxide film will form at the surface of Si in the cutting process. The high oxygen content in the KL-Si requires reducing agents that may cause contamination in the remelted Si. Instead of remelting KL-Si, the direct use of KL-Si as value-added feedstock will be another approach for valorizing KL-Si.
KL-Si could be a promising and low-cost LIBs anode, and the use of KL-Si as the LIB anode has been researched.12,17–19 Kim et al. reported a Si-kerf/graphene oxide blend with a high initial reversible capacity of about 1600 mA h g−1 and a capacity retention of approximately 65% after 50 cycles.20 Lu et al. used photovoltaic monocrystalline Si waste to derive a hierarchical Si/flake graphite/C composite as the anode for LIBs. It exhibited an initial specific capacity of 634 mA h g−1 at 0.2C with a capacity retention of 82% after 200 cycles.21 Hsieh et al. proposed a one-step method for synthesizing a N-doped Si/C composite derived from Si wastes as an anode material for LIBs. The N-doped Si/C composite delivered a high reversible capacity of 1238 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5C.11 Eshraghi et al. employed photovoltaic industry waste Si as cheap feedstock to prepare high purity Si with a combined alkali–acid leaching and ball milling approach, resulting in a capacity of around 1400 mA h g−1.12 Zhang et al. introduced stable cycling for 200 cycles with a high capacity of about 2700 mA h g−1. In their work, Si micro-plates underwent a relatively complex pre-treatment: cleaning with diluted hydrochloric acid to remove metal contamination, removal of the native oxide layer with hydrofluoric acid and then treatment with a sulfuric acid hydrogen peroxide mixture to form an SiOx surface layer.17 Thus, reducing the oxygen content and rationally designing the structures of KL-Si are two ways to improve the Li-storage performance of KL-Si. Meanwhile, fabricating a hollow space between the Si core and carbon coating is a general method to accommodate the volume expansion of the Si anode. Since the KL-Si has a native oxide film that is formed during the cutting process, the oxide film could be a natural template to fabricate the Si@void@C structure by chemically etching KL-Si@C.
Herein we report a facile method to engineer a naturally generated SiOx film and organic layer for the preparation of a Si@void@C composite anode from KL-Si by a two-step approach including carbon coating and acid etching. Firstly, KL-Si was converted to KL-Si@C by the pyrolysis of melamine resin. Subsequently, the KL-Si@C was converted to Si@void@C by etching the SiOx film away. Finally, the Li-storage performances of the Si@void@C composite were measured in both half-type cells with a Li foil counter electrode and full cells with a LiNCM cathode.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
All chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. KL-Si (∼1 μm in diameter) was provided by Jiangsu Haobo Photovoltaic Technology Co., Ltd. Formaldehyde (F) solution (37 wt%) and ethanol (>99.5 vol%) were purchased from Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd (Shenyang, China). Melamine (M) was supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was obtained from Dodochem Co., Ltd. Sodium alginate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Biochemical Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Home-made deionized (DI) water was used in all experiments.
2.2 Coating carbon and etching the oxide film
The hollow structured Si@void@C composite was synthesized via a hydrothermal method using formaldehyde and melamine as the carbon feedstock and KL-Si as the Si feedstock. First, 2.8 g of melamine, 6.0 mL of formaldehyde solution and acetic acid (1.2 mL) were dissolved in 100 mL of DI water and the solution was stirred at 60 °C for 20 min until the solution became clear (this solution was defined as the MF solution). Then, KL-Si was added into the MF solution under magnetic stirring for 20 min at 40 °C. Third, the mixed solution was transferred to a closed bottle and heated at 80 °C for 24 h. Fourth, the solution with KL-Si@MF was centrifuged, and the solid product was washed with DI water and ethanol, successively. Then, the solid product was freeze-dried for 10 h and then placed in a tube furnace protected by an Ar flow. The carbonization of the solid product was performed at 700 °C for 2 h (heating rate: 10 °C min−1) to prepare the KL-Si@C composite. Finally, the KL-Si@C composite was immersed in a 10 wt% hydrofluoric acid (HF) aqueous solution for 10 min to remove the SiOx film, and the Si@void@C composite was obtained by centrifugation and washing with ethanol three times.
2.3 Electrochemical performances
The electrochemical performances of the pretreated KL-Si, KL-Si@C and Si@void@C composites were measured using coin-type half cells (CR2025) with Li foil as both the counter and reference electrodes, and all the cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox. First, a slurry was prepared by mixing active materials, Super-P, and sodium alginate with a mass ratio of 6:2:2 in DI water. Then, the slurry was coated on copper foil and then dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. Finally, the copper foil was cut into disc electrodes and each disc electrode had a mass loading of ∼1.2 mg cm−2. For assembling a full cell, the Si@void@C anode was coupled with a LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (LiNCM) cathode. The fabrication of the LiNCM cathode was similar to that of the anode. First, a slurry was made by adding LiNCM, acetylene black and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in a mass ratio of 8:1:1 into N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP). Then, the obtained slurry was spread onto an Al foil substrate and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. A full cell was assembled by using a prelithiated Si@void@C anode and a LiNCM cathode, and the capacity ratio of the anode to cathode (N/P ratio) in the full cell was 1.1. The prelithiation of the Si@void@C anode was achieved by charging and discharging the cell with a Li foil counter electrode for two cycles. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethylene carbonate (DEC) (1:1 by volume) with 5 vol% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the additive. A polypropylene microporous film (Celgard2400) was used as the separator. The electrochemical performances were measured using a battery test system (LAND CT2001A, Wuhan LAND Electronics Co., Ltd., China) between 0.01 and 1.2 V for the half-type cell anode, 2.8–4.5 V for the half cell cathode, and 2.8–4.3 V for full cells. Before cycling measurements, all electrodes were activated at 0.2 A g−1 in the initial five cycles. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E, Shanghai CH Instrument Company, China). CV measurements were performed at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1, and EIS measurements were recorded by applying an alternating current (AC) voltage of 5 mV amplitude in the 10−2 to 105 Hz frequency range. All electrochemical tests were executed at room temperature.
2.4 Materials characterization
The crystal structures of all samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8, Bruker Germany). The microstructures and morphologies of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, accelerating voltage of 5.0 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100, accelerating voltage of 200 kV). The samples were degassed under vacuum for 24 h, and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were obtained (American Micromeritics ASAP 2020) at 77.1 K. Nonlocal density functional theory was used to check the pore size distribution of samples based on N2 adsorption data. The total pore volume was analyzed based on the adsorbed amount at a relative pressure P/P0 = 0.99. The micropore information was estimated by t-plot theory, and the mesopore information was analyzed using the adsorption data based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda theory. Raman spectroscopy was used to examine the structure of carbon (Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman Microscope). The states of chemical bonding were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250) using Al Kα X-rays at 1486.6 eV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in air with a temperature ramp of 10 °C min−1 from 25 to 800 °C using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA Q500). The surface group was investigated using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR, Perkin-Elmer 843).
3. Results and discussion
The synthesis process of the natural SiOx sacrificial film and organic layer assisted double templated fabrication of Si@void@C are shown in Fig. 1a. Firstly, melamine (M) and formaldehyde (F) were polymerized on the surface of KL-Si in the presence of acetic acid to form the MF-coated KL-Si (KL-Si@MF) structure. Thereafter, the MF coating and the organic layer (natural template 1) on the KL-Si surface was converted to porous carbon through high temperature pyrolysis. Subsequently, the SiOx film (natural template 2) was removed by etching in the HF solution, making voids between the Si core and the porous carbon shell. Finally, Si@void@C was obtained by centrifugation and washing. The surface morphology of the as-prepared and the control samples was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), with the images under different magnifications shown in Fig. 1b–g. The KL-Si is highly aggregated and mainly irregular thin flakes. The thickness of the flakes is about 100 nm and they are hundreds of nanometers in length. The flakes and thin morphology provide a large specific surface area, making Si prone to easy oxidation (Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. S1a and b,† KL-Si has a clear SiOx film with a thickness of ∼10 nm. The EDS results shown in Fig. S1c† show that KL-Si mainly consisted of Si (81.72 wt%), C (12.61 wt%), O (5.55 wt%), and Al (0.12 wt%). The presence of O and C in KL-Si is due to the oxidation of the Si particles and the use of an organic lubricant during the sawing process, respectively. Al is mainly attributed to the introduction of the polyaluminium chloride flocculant during the precipitation process. The surface of the obtained core–shell KL-Si@C composite became smooth (Fig. 1c and S2a, b†), indicating that the carbon has been coated on the surface of KL-Si. Voids appeared in a few broken sphere-like Si@void@C particles after the KL-Si@C composite was etched in the HF solution (Fig. 1d and f). The SEM-EDS elemental mapping images of the Si@void@C composite (Fig. S3a–d†) showed that Si, C and N elements were evenly distributed in the hollow structure, which further verifies that Si was dispersed uniformly in the carbon spherical shell. In addition, the presence of the Al element was not clearly observed. Interestingly, the presence of the N element indicated that the application of melamine-pyrolyzed carbon was effectual. Si particles and voids were encapsulated in the carbon shell, and the Si particles were surrounded by the carbon matrix (Fig. 1e). The HR-TEM image further proves that the crystalline Si is encapsulated in the carbon layer, and the voids exist between Si and the porous polymer-derived carbon matrix (Fig. 1g). Meanwhile, some pores are observed in the carbon matrix, and these pore structure could be attributed to the evaporation of gaseous species and the organic layer during pyrolysis. Moreover, the lattice spacing of Si crystals was measured to be 0.315 nm, which corresponds to the (111) plane of cubic Si. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is shown in the inset in which clear multi-concentric diffraction rings confirm the polycrystalline nature of Si.22,23

The phase composition of KL-Si and Si@void@C was characterized by XRD analysis (Fig. 2a). All diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the cubic Si phase (JCPDS Card no. 01-0787).24,25 Meanwhile, a sharp and strong peak located at around 26.8° is due to the formation of the SiOx film on the surface of Si during diamond-wire slicing of solar-grade Si ingots. The additional weak and broad reflection around 23.4° for the Si@void@C might be ascribed to the pyrolyzed carbon with a low graphitization degree.26 The diffraction peaks of SiOx disappeared after the KL-Si (Fig. S4†) and KL-Si@C were etched in the HF solution. Two peaks at around 514 cm−1 and 954 cm−1 in the Raman spectra of the KL-Si and Si@void@C are attributed to Si (Fig. 2b). Two broad peaks at 1354 cm−1 and 1596 cm−1 correspond to the D-band and G-band of the carbon species, respectively. The D band is related to the disordered structures and structural defects, while the G band is associated with vibration in all sp2 carbon domains.27,28 The calculated ID/IG ratio for Si@void@C is about 1.15, indicating that the carbon species contained in the Si@void@C composite samples is in the form of a disordered structure. The TGA curves of the bare Si and Si@void@C are shown from room temperature to 800 °C under an air atmosphere in Fig. 2c. After correction with bare Si, the content of Si in Si@void@C is about 43 wt%. The presence of silicon oxide in KL-Si was further analyzed by FT-IR with the results shown in Fig. 2d. Peaks at 1211.7 and 1088.4 cm−1 are ascribed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of Si–O–Si.29 The weak peaks located at 801.2 cm−1 and 483.7 cm−1 correspond to the Si–O symmetric stretching vibration and bending vibration,30 respectively, which demonstrates that the KL-Si was partly oxidized. XPS measurements were performed to further elucidate the chemical state of the elements on the surface of Si@void@C. It is apparent that Si, C, N, and O coexist in the survey scan spectrum without any other impurities (Fig. 2e). The specific surface area and porosity of KL-Si, KL-Si@C, and Si@void@C are further investigated by N2 adsorption–desorption measurements (Fig. 2f). Compared with KL-Si, the hysteresis loops in the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of Si@void@C and KL-Si@C composites are considerably enlarged at high relative pressures (P/P0 > 0.4) because of the significantly expanded mesopores and substantial pores generated by etching with HF, while the fast growth rate at low relative pressures can be ascribed to the filling of the micropores.31 The specific surface areas of KL-Si, KL-Si@C, and Si@void@C composites calculated by the BET method are 19.11, 317.29, and 333.25 m2 g−1, respectively. The N-doped carbon layer increases the specific surface area of KL-Si. The cumulative pore volume of the Si@void@C composite is up to 0.32 cm3 g−1 (Fig. S5†), indicating that the increased pore volume is ascribed to the micropores and mesopores. Meanwhile, the corresponding pore-size distributions of the samples were analyzed by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, showing that the pores of the Si are mainly centered in the range of 10–60 nm and the pore-size distribution widths of the KL-Si@C and Si@void@C composites are distinctly expanded (Fig. S6†). In particular, the Si@void@C composite has a majority of pores distributed in the mesoporous region with an average pore size of around 13.1 nm. These pore characteristics agree well with the surface area information shown in Table S1.† The abundant mesopores and the more diverse pore structure will likely facilitate Li+/electron diffusivity by efficiently decreasing the resistance within transmission channels and also provide more accessible active sites for the electrochemical process and alleviate the volume changes of the active Si particles during lithium storage.32

The deconvolution of the high resolution XPS profiles of Si 2p, C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s is presented in Fig. 3. In the high-resolution spectrum of Si 2p (Fig. 3a), the peaks at 99.2, 100.9, and 102.8 eV are ascribed to Si–Si, Si–C, and Si–O, respectively.10,33Fig. 3b shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of C 1s. After deconvoluted spectra, the main peak can be divided into four peaks at 284.5, 285.4, 286.3, and 287.9 eV, which correspond to CC, C–C, C–N, and CN bonds, respectively. The XPS results confirm the strong interaction between the amorphous carbon and the N dopant. Furthermore, the N 1s spectrum is presented in Fig. 3c. There are three parts after deconvolution, referring to pyridinic nitrogen (N-6, 397.9 eV), pyrrolic nitrogen (N-5, 398.5 eV), and quaternary nitrogen (N-Q, 400.5 eV), respectively.23,28 The N-5 and N-6 species provide numerous active sites for enhancing the capacitive performances of the Si@void@C composite for LIBs, while the presence of N-Q is beneficial for improving the conductivity of composites.34–37 The O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3d) includes three fitted peaks at 530.9, 532.1, and 533.2 eV, which are attributed to CO, C–OH, and C–O–C bonds, respectively. The faradaic reaction between oxygen-containing groups and Li+ may contribute to the enhancement in storage capacity.

Cyclic voltammetry experiments show typical lithiation and delithiation peaks for the Si electrode (Fig. 4a). In the first cycle, the apparent broad cathodic peak appearing at around 0.7 V is related to the formation of the SEI layer of the Si@void@C composite.22,28,38 However, the cathodic peak disappears in subsequent cycles, indicating that a stable SEI layer is formed. A cathodic peak at about 0.2 V can be clearly observed from the second cycle, indicating Li+ intercalation into pyrolytic carbon layers and the conversion of the crystalline Si to amorphous LixSi. During delithiation, two anodic peaks at 0.3 and 0.5 V are attributed to extraction of Li+ from pyrolytic carbon and the conversion from LixSi to amorphous Si, respectively.39,40 Furthermore, the intensity of the two delithiation peaks increases gradually with the cycles, indicating the improvement of reversibility. Simultaneously, the cathodic peak gradually moves to 0.05 V in subsequent cycles because of the transformation of crystalline Si to amorphous Si.41 As shown in Fig. 4b, the discharge capacity of the Si@void@C composite is 1764.5 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of 65.1%. The capacity loss from the first to the fifth cycle is due to the reformation of the SEI layer.42 After 300 cycles, the capacity is 1164.4 mA h g−1 with a capacity retention of 84.1%, indicating a good structural stability of the Si@void@C composite. The rate capabilities of the KL-Si@C and Si@void@C anodes were measured from 0.2 to 2 A g−1 (Fig. 4c). The Si@void@C composite shows a superior rate capability and cycle stability. The discharge capacity of Si@void@C is 1611 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and decreases to 1027 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1. More importantly, the specific discharge capacity returned to 1598 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1. In contrast, the KL-Si@C composite delivers a capacity of 670 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1, indicating that the rate performance of the KL-Si@C composite is poorer than that of the Si@void@C composite. As shown in Fig. 4d and S7,† the KL-Si electrode has a poor cycling performance, i.e., the capacity reaches below 50 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. The KL-Si@C composite electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 578.3 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles, indicating that the performance of the KL-Si electrode is improved by coating a carbon layer. Further, the Si@void@C composite electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 1164.4 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles, implying that the electrochemical performance is further improved by etching the SiOx film thereby creating voids between the carbon coating and Si core. The electrochemical kinetics of the Si@void@C electrode was studied by EIS. The inclined lines in the low-frequency range are related to the Warburg impedance of Li-ion diffusion within electrodes (Fig. 4e), while the intersection point on the horizontal axis and the semicircles in the high-frequency segment correspond to the equivalent series resistance (Re) and charge transfer resistance (Rct).43,44 The Re and Rct values of the as-prepared electrode materials are listed in Table S2.† The Si@void@C electrode exhibits a smaller semicircle than the KL-Si@C and KL-Si electrodes, implying that the Si@void@C electrode has a smaller Rct value and a lower charge transfer resistance. Moreover, the Si@void@C electrode has faster Li+ transport kinetics than KL-Si and KL-Si@C because the Si@void@C electrode has a more vertical straight line.

The Li-storage mechanism is studied by cyclic voltammetry. There are two Li-storage mechanisms, i.e., surface-controlled and diffusion-controlled processes. The surface-controlled capacity involves the faradaic contribution from the surface pseudocapacitor reaction and the non-faradaic contribution from Li+ adsorption/desorption processes. The diffusion-controlled process is mainly related to Li+ insertion/extraction within electrode materials.45,46 The charge storage mechanism of the electrode materials can be studied from the CV curves at various scan rates (Fig. 4f) using eqn (1):47 I = avb(1)where I is the current response at a certain voltage V, v is the sweep rate, and a and b are adjustable parameters. The b value can be used to judge if the charge storage is a surface-controlled (b close to 1) or diffusion-controlled (b approaches 0.5) process.48–50 Parameter b is determined from the slope of the linear plot of log(I) versus log(v), which is the indicator of the kinetics of charge storage and can reveal the corresponding Li-storage mechanism. As shown in Fig. 4g, the b value is obtained by linearly fitting the different peak currents and scan rates of Si@void@C, in which the b values of the positive scan (peak 2) and negative scan (peak 1) are 0.721 and 0.864, respectively, indicating that the capacitance contribution cannot be ignored.
The Li-storage mechanism could be further measured using eqn (2) which was proposed by Dunn et al.51 I(V) = k1v + k2v1/2(2)where I(V) is the current response at a given voltage V and k1 and k2 are adjustable parameters. The k1 and k2 values can be obtained from eqn (2). k1v stands for the capacitance-contribution and k2v1/2 represents the contribution from the diffusion process. Fig. 4h shows the surface controlled capacitance contribution (pink region) and diffusion-controlled process (olive region) at a sweep rate of 0.4 mV s−1, indicating that the contribution of surface capacitance-controlled capacity is 39.2% of the total capacity. The contribution ratio of surface-controlled capacitance increases from 33.4% to 60.3% with the increasing scan rate from 0.2 to 1 mV s−1 (Fig. 4i). Thus, it was believed that even higher contribution of surface-controlled storage would be realized at higher scan rates, because the capacitive behavior at the surface of electrodes could provide rapid charge/discharge characteristics, rather than sluggish ion insertion/extraction kinetics during the diffusion-controlled process.
The long-term cycling performances of the Si@void@C electrode are shown in Fig. 5a and the corresponding GCD profile is shown in Fig. S8.† The electrode showed excellent electrochemical cycling performance at 3 A g−1, i.e., the capacity remains at 927 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles. Furthermore, relative to the discharge specific capacity (1190.1 mA h g−1) at the 10th cycle, the capacity retention values after 300 and 500 cycles were 85.4% and 77.9%, respectively. The discharge capacities of the Si@void@C electrode with different mass loadings are shown in Fig. S9.† At a mass loading of 2.32 mg cm−2, the discharge capacities of the Si@void@C reached 694.5 at 3 A g−1 after 100 cycles and still displayed good stable cycle stability. The electrochemical performances of the Si@void@C composite are equal to or superior to those reported in the literature (Table S3†). The results further indicated the stable structure during discharge and charge cycles, even at high charge and discharge rates, mainly because the interconnected porous structure and the coated carbon layer can provide a sufficient transmission path for lithium ions. Full cells with the prelithiated Si@void@C composite anode and LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (LiNCM) cathode were built to further demonstrate their electrochemical performances. The Si@void@C‖LiNCM full cell exhibited a reversible capacity of 122.7 mA h g−1 at 1C and the capacity remained at 100.1 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles (Fig. 5b). The capacity retention ratio reached 81.5% and the initial coulombic efficiency was 89.1%. The fabricated Si@void@C‖LiNCM full cell is schematically shown in Fig. 5c. As shown in Fig. 5d, the full-cell based on the Si@void@C‖LiNCM cell can power a small red-light emitting diode (LED), demonstrating its practical applications in energy storage devices.

4. Conclusions
A combined carbon coating and acid etching approach can convert low-cost KL-Si waste to high-performance Si@void@C anodes for LIBs. The resin-derived N-doped carbon coating increases the electrical conductivity and Li-ion transport kinetics of the Si@void@C electrode, and a naturally formed oxide film serves as a natural template to accommodate the volume expansion caused by hosting Li during the alloying process. The as-prepared Si@void@C composite delivers a high capacity of 927 mA h g−1 at 3 A g−1 after 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 77.9%. Moreover, a Si@void@C‖LiNCM full cell exhibits a high energy density of 473.6 W h kg−1, demonstrating that the Si@void@C electrode is a promising candidate for powering energy storage devices. By using this approach, Si ingots can be fully utilized for producing both Si wafers for solar cells generating green electricity and Si anodes for LIBs storing the electrical energy produced by the Si solar cells, providing a closed-loop route for valorizing Si-based materials.
