    , Accepted 6th February 2022First published on 7th February 2022AbstractRecently, lead-based halide perovskites have gained extensive attention due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, the toxicity of lead would seriously limit its future application. To address these issues, in this work novel ligand-free organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide TBASnCl3 (C16H36NSnCl3) quantum dots are synthesized by a one-pot method at room temperature, and they showed high anti-water stability and high potential applications for high-performance UVC photodetectors. Our experimental data showed that the responsivity of the lateral photodetectors Au/TBASnCl3/Au, in which the active layer (i.e. TBASnCl3) was synthesized by further introducing SnF2 as a precursor besides SnCl2, reached 7.3 mA W−1 with a specific detectivity of 1.67 × 1011 Jones under 0.36 mW cm−2 254 nm illumination at −5 V, and it showed a long lifetime even in an environment with an air humidity of 60%. Therefore, it laid a solid foundation for further fabricating lead-free metal halide optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskites are emerging as attractive optoelectronic materials for solar cells,1–3 light-emitting diodes4–9 and photodetectors9–13 due to their excellent facile fabrication strategies, long carrier diffusion lengths, and high charge carrier mobilities. All currently reported high-performance perovskite optoelectronics are primarily based on Pb-based perovskites.1,2,4,5,9–14 However, toxic Pb has caused serious concern due to its environmental impact, and the toxic mixture of dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can also harm human health and the environment seriously.15 In order to eliminate the toxicity of Pb from the environment, Pb2+ can be replaced by lower-toxicity cations, such as Sn2+, Ge2+, Bi3+ or Sb3+. However, the trivalent oxidation state of Sb3+ and Bi3+ destroys the electrically neutral equilibrium in ABX3.16 The 4s2 lone pair electrons of Ge2+ are easy to lose, so the chemical stability of Ge-based perovskites is very poor.17,18 Thus, Sn-based perovskites are considered to be more promising candidates for new generation lead-free perovskites. Nevertheless, Sn2+ is easily oxidized, thus producing a high density of Sn4+ defects, and the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ can gradually extend from the surface of the crystal to the inside of the bulk material due to the diffusion of ions, which leads to a serious decline in the photoelectric performance of Sn-perovskites.19 All inorganic CsSnI3 perovskite was first reported in the late 1970s20 and the Schottky solar cells based on CsSnI3 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of only ∼0.9%.21 In 2014, the Kanatzidis group22 and Snaith group23 independently prepared perovskite solar cells based on MASnI3, and their PCEs showed an efficiency of 5.7% and 6.4%, respectively. In 2021, Wang et al.24 prepared FASnI3 solar cells with a PCE of up to 13.4% (certified 12.4%). However, most of these reported Sn-perovskite devices can remain stable in air only for tens of minutes,25,26 and even their preparation and characterization still need to be performed in the glove box.27,28 As a result, it's quite necessary and very important to further enhance the stability and optoelectronic performance of the Sn-perovskites and their related devices.
Usually, the defects caused by Sn2+ are the main obstacles to further developing high-performance Sn-based perovskite optoelectronics. There are two types of defects caused by Sn2+:
(1) The facile conversion of Sn2+ to Sn4+ leads to self-doping of the Sn-based perovskite; (2) the low defect formation energy leading to high-density of Sn-vacancies.29 The defects on the surface of perovskite grains play an important role in the performance of tin-based perovskite optoelectronic devices.30 In the last decade, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to reducing the degree of oxidation and improving the stability of the Sn-perovskites. For example, SnX2 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) was usually added to the tin-based perovskite precursor solution to maintain a reducing environment and to reduce the degree of Sn2+ being oxidized.31 Heo et al.32 reported that the generation of surface or grain boundary (GB) passivation leads to a great improvement in the stability of CsSnI3 after introducing SnX2 into CsSnI3. In addition, the introduction of low-dimensional structure materials can also significantly improve the stability and quality of Sn-based perovskites.33 Also, previous reports have shown that the introduction of conventional organic cation halide salts (such as phenethylammonium ions, PEA+) resulted in the formation of low-dimensional perovskites.34–36 Meanwhile, PEA+ can reduce the diffusion of O2 and passivate the surface defects due to the large molecules of PEA+, PEAI (2-phenylethanamine iodide) as a passivating agent exhibits greater stability than MAI.37 In 2018, Qian et al.35 reported for the first time a flexible photodetector based on lead-free 2D perovskite (PEA)2SnI4, which showed a photoresponsivity of 16 A W−1 and a detectivity of 1.92 × 1011 Jones under 56.9 μW cm−2 illumination at −5 V. However, most of the studies on tin-based perovskites have reported improved stability by introducing additives such as SnX2 (X = F, Cl, Br and I), deoxidizers such as hypophosphorous acid (HPA), ascorbic acid (AA) and hydrazine, and reduced dimensions.31 As a superoxide stabilizer, the presence of water can significantly enhance the rate of oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+,37 but many researchers have overlooked this. In 2021, Peng et al.38 reported 0D organic tin(II)-chloride hybrids with high anti-water stability, which could stay in water for 24 hours without any degradation. In addition, the introduction of TBA+ can also form a perovskite protective layer which can heal defects at the surface of CsPbI3.39 This is the first report on the use of TBA+ to entirely replace the common Cs+, MA+ and FA+ in Sn-perovskites to produce novel TBASnCl3 (C16H36NSnCl3) ligand-free quantum dots (QDs), which showed high anti-water stability through one-pot synthesis at room temperature.
In this work, therefore we firstly synthesize novel ligand-free TBASnCl3 QDs with high anti-water stability and then used them as the active layer to make high-performance lateral photodetectors Au/TBASnCl3/Au, in which the Au electrodes are made of interdigital electrodes. To improve the device performance further, SnF2 was introduced into the precursors besides SnCl2 for synthesizing TBASnCl3 QDs. As a result, we found that the dark current reduced to 1.9 × 10−11 A when the precursors’ concentration ratio of SnCl2 to SnF2 (i.e. KCR = MSnCl2/MSnF2) equals 10:1. Meanwhile, the on/off current ratio from the lateral photodetector Au/TBASnCl3/Au reached 1.22 × 103 under 1.2 mW cm−2 254 nm illumination at −5 V. Further, the physical mechanism for such an enhanced performance is discussed in detail.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
The chemical reagents used in the experiments are of analytical grade and they were used as received. Tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBACl, ≥98.0%), Sn chloride (SnCl2, 98%) and Sn fluoride (SnF2, 99%) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Ethanol was purchased from Shanghai Macleans Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. ITO substrates (8 Ω □−1) were bought from Xiangcheng Technology Co., Ltd.
2.2 Preparation of TBASnCl3 precursor solution
The TBASnCl3 precursor was prepared by dissolving TBACl (0.6 M), SnCl2 (0.6 M), and different amounts of SnF2 (0 M, 0.03 M, 0.06 M, and 0.12 M) in 5 mL ethanol and stirred for 1 hour at 50 °C to form a uniform TBASnCl3 precursor. The precursor was filtered through a 0.22 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFT) filter before use.
2.3 Device fabrication
The brief fabrication process of the photodetector is schematically illustrated in Fig. S2.† Firstly, the glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using a neutral detergent, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and isopropanol for 15 min sequentially, followed by ozone treatment in a UV–ozone cleaner for 10 min. Then 100 nm Au interdigital electrodes were thermally evaporated on the glass substrates under the same vacuum conditions via a shadow mask. Finally, the TBASnCl3 precursor solution was spin-coated on the glass substrates at 1500 rpm for 30 s, and annealed at 70 °C for 1 h. All preparations and testing measurements of the lateral photodetectors were carried out in an indoor environment.
2.4 Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of TBASnCl3 QDs were recorded using a Talos F200X G2. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of TBASnCl3 QD films were measured using a JSM-7500F SEM operated at an accelerating voltage of up to 10 kV. The absorption spectrum of TBASnCl3 QD films was recorded by UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The PL spectra of TBASnCl3 QD films were measured under 254 nm illumination using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, F-4600), and the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the TBASnCl3 QD films on a glass plate was measured using a 254 nm laser with a FLS980 spectrometer. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the TBASnCl3 QD films were recorded with a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the TBASnCl3 QD films were measured with a 5000 Versa probe III. The current–voltage (I–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 4200-SCS and Keithley 2401. The effective illumination area of the device is about 3.25 × 10−3 cm2.
3. Results and discussion
The crystallinity of the as-synthesized TBASnCl3 QDs was examined by TEM, HRTEM, and SAED, as shown in Fig. 1. From here, one can see that TBASnCl3 QDs exhibit excellent monodispersity. The particle size of TBASnCl3 QDs mainly lies in the range of 4–10 nm, and their average particle size is ∼6.91 nm (see Fig. 1(b)). This is mainly due to the fact that the above quantum dots are not covered by any surfactants and ligands. One can observe the clear lattice fringes of (429) from the high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image (see Fig. 1(c)), and the lattice spacing of (429) is 1.6 Å. As shown in Fig. 1(d), the symmetry of TBASnCl3 QDs was revealed by the selected area electron diffraction (SEAD) pattern. In order to further confirm the composition of the as-synthesized TBASnCl3 QDs, the XPS spectrum was recorded, from which the XPS signals of Sn 3d, C 1s and Cl 2p were observed, as shown in Fig. S1(a) (in the ESI†). The structure diagram of TBASnCl3 QDs is shown in Fig. S1(b).†

As one knows, the annealing temperature is critical for constructing high-performance devices. A lower thermal energy is not enough to improve the morphology and a lower annealing temperature can result in more recombination states. In contrast, a higher annealing temperature can create higher distortion and internal stress in the crystal lattice, thus leading to more defects on the film surface.40Fig. 2(a)–(d) show the SEM images of the TBASnCl3 QD film before and after its annealing at 70 °C. When the TBASnCl3 QD film was not annealed, it showed some pinholes with a diameter of ∼1 μm and a large number of wrinkles (see Fig. 2(a) and (b)). After its annealing at 70 °C, the TBASnCl3 QD film becomes denser and more continuous (see Fig. 2(c) and (d)). In addition, one can see that the TBASnCl3 QD film is composed of C, Sn and Cl with an atomic ratio of ∼16:1:3 (see Fig. S3(a)†), and these elements are evenly distributed in TBASnCl3 QD films (see Fig. S3(b)†). These results are consistent with the XPS spectrum shown in Fig. S1(a).†

The absorption spectra of the TBASnCl3 QD film were recorded using UV-vis-NIR DRS, as shown in Fig. 3(a). From here, one can clearly see that the absorption peak of the TBASnCl3 QD film is located at 226 nm, showing a band gap (Eg) of 4.65 eV. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the photoluminescence (PL) peak locates at 521 nm with a narrow full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of ∼55 nm. When the TBASnCl3 QD film is deposited in air with an air humidity of 60% for one week, it can still maintain 48% of its original PL performance (see the inset of Fig. S4(a)†). The crystallinity and structure of the TBASnCl3 QD film and powder coated on a glass substrate were characterized by XRD, as shown in Fig. 3(c). The characteristic peaks of the pristine TBASnCl3 QD film at 8.29°, 9.43°and 19.53° correspond to the crystal planes of (011), (100), and (10−4), respectively. One can see that the XRD patterns of the TBASnCl3 QD film and powder are consistent with the calculated curves for single crystals (see Fig. S5†). However, the XRD patterns of the TBASnCl3 QD film are clearly different from those of the single crystal powder. The TBASnCl3 QD film on glass showed only three diffraction peaks, other diffraction peaks in the TBASnCl3 QD film can be observed after the XRD patterns of the TBASnCl3 QD film are amplified (see Fig. S6†). In addition, one can also see that the diffraction intensity of its (100) peak reaches the maximum value when the annealing temperature is 70 °C. The (011), (100) and (10−4) peak intensities of the TBASnCl3 QD film decrease with increasing annealing temperature, especially for the cases where the annealing temperature exceeds 70 °C. However, the (100) peak shows the fastest rate of decrease with temperature (see Fig. S7(a)–(c)†). The above phenomenon is mainly caused by the decomposition or volatilization of TBA+ after its high temperature annealing, and this explanation can be confirmed by Fig. S7(d).†Fig. 3(d) depicts the XPS of the pristine Sn2+, the binding energies of 494.8 eV and 486.3 eV can be assigned to 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of divalent Sn2+,41 indicating that Sn2+ is not oxidized to Sn4+.

Fig. 4(a) shows the UPS spectra of the TBASnCl3 QD film, and the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) can be figured out directly from the UPS spectra42 by the following equation, EHOMO = hν – (Ecutoff – Eonset)(1)where Ecutoff = 16.0 eV and Eonset = 3.3 eV can be obtained, respectively, from Fig. S8(a) and (b).† For the TBASnCl3 QD film, it is easy to obtain EHOMO = −8.52 eV. The LUMO energy can be figured out using the HOMO levels and the optical gaps (Eg). Fig. 4(a) shows the (Ahν)2 ∼ hν curve of the TBASnCl3 QD film, Eg = 4.65 eV, and then ELUMO is −3.87 eV. Also, the time-resolved PL (TRPL) decay spectra of the TBASnCl3 QD film are shown in Fig. 4(b). After fitting the TRPL curves, a fast decay time of 5.55 ns, a slow decay time of 25.33 ns and an average time of 24.06 ns are obtained, respectively. From these optical properties, one can see that the as-synthesized TBASnCl3 QDs have shown great potential applications for photodetectors. Furthermore, lateral photodetector Au/TBASnCl3/Au was made, in which the Au electrodes were fabricated through interdigital electrodes, as shown in Fig. 4(c). And the channel length and channel width are 4.25 mm and 85 μm, respectively, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(b). In order to determine the underlying physical mechanism of the lateral photodetector Au/TBASnCl3/Au, its energy band is presented in Fig. 4(d). Under 254 nm illumination, electron–hole pairs can be generated in the TBASnCl3 QD film, and then the photogenerated electrons and holes will be swept aside to the corresponding electrode, respectively, and thus it contributes to the photocurrent.

Due to the low formation energy of Sn vacancies and the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, Sn vacancy defects are the obstacles restricting the further development of Sn-perovskite optoelectronic devices.20 Some investigations on Sn-based43–45 and mixed Sn–Pb perovskites46 showed that the addition of Sn fluoride (SnF2) can decrease the concentration of Sn vacancies and thus improve the photovoltaic performance greatly. In order to further improve the performances of the lateral photodetector Au/TBASnCl3/Au, SnF2 as a precursor was also introduced during the synthesis of TBASnCl3 QDs. The TBASnCl3 precursors with different concentration of SnF2 (MSnF2 = 0, 0.03, 0.06 and 0.12 M) are optimized for the lateral photodetector Au/TBASnCl3/Au. Fig. 5 shows the dark-current and photocurrent of the lateral photodetector Au/TBASnCl3/Au with different concentration of SnF2 under 1.2 mW cm−2 254 nm illumination. The on/off current ratio (K), responsivity (R) and specific detectivity (D*) of the photodetectors were defined by the following equations, (2) (3) (4)where Ip is the photocurrent under illumination, Id is the dark-current, Popt is the incident light intensity, A is the effective photosensitive area and e is the elementary charge. We found that the dark-current from the lateral photodetector Au/TBASnCl3/Au decreases from 8.9 × 10−10 A to 1.9 × 10−11 A when the concentration of SnF2 increases from 0 to 0.06 M. Meanwhile, its photocurrent decreases slightly from 5.85 × 10−8 A to 2.32 × 10−8 A. Based on above eqn (2)–(4), one can see that the on/off current ratio increases from 67.06 to 1220 when the concentration of SnF2 increases from 0 to 0.06 M. R and D* of the lateral photodetector Au/TBASnCl3/Au reach 5.9 mA W−1 and 1.35 × 1011 Jones, respectively. These results show that the device performance of the lateral photodetector Au/TBASnCl3/Au has been enhanced greatly after increasing the concentration of SnF2. The maximum device performance of the lateral photodetector Au/TBASnCl3/Au was obtained with the concentration ratio KCR = 10:1, which is consistent with the phenomenon mentioned above. However, both the dark-current and photo-current decrease with increasing concentration of SnF2. Tsai et al.46 reported that the Sn vacancies can be reduced by introducing SnF2, meanwhile, it will decrease the conductivity of the Sn-based perovskites. In other words, there should be an optimum concentration for SnF2 in the precursors, as shown in Table 1, implying 0.06 mol L−1 of SnF2 can reach the maximum device performance.

Fig. 6(a) shows the typical I–V curves of lateral photodetector Au/TBASnCl3/Au under different light intensities (i.e. 0, 0.36, 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2 mW cm−2) with the concentration ratio KCR = 10:1. The rising time is defined as the time required for the photocurrent to increase from 10% to 90% of the maximum photocurrent, and the falling time is defined as the time required for the photocurrent to decrease from 90% to 10%.49 From Fig. 6(b), we can obtain the rising time of 62.813 s and a decay time of 66.359 s for this UVC photodetector Au/TBASnCl3/Au under 1.2 mW cm−2 254 nm illumination at −5 V. From Fig. 6(c), one can see that the on/off current ratio increases from 374.3 to 1220 and the photocurrent increases from 7.13 × 10−9 A to 2.32 × 10−8 A with increasing incident light intensity. The photocurrent can be expressed by the following equation, Iph = Kc·Poptθ(5)where Iph = Ip − Id, Kc is a constant, and θ represents the power law index. θ = 0.52 can be figured out under 254 nm illumination by fitting the curves of the incident light intensity-dependent photocurrent, as shown in Fig. 6(d). From the above results, we can understand the energy loss in the process of converting incident light energy into photocurrent, which is caused by the entire process of carrier generation, transfer, trapping and recombination in TBASnCl3 QDs.50 In addition, R and D* decrease with increasing incident light intensity since the photogenerated carriers will occupy the surface states, especially when the incident light intensity is weak. Once the incident light intensity increases to a certain value, the surface state will be completely filled. Meanwhile, excess carriers will recombine immediately, and then the photo-current saturates.11 The device performances of our lateral photodetectors Au/TBASnCl3/Au and other similar perovskite-based photodetectors reported previously are summarized in Table 2, obviously, the on/off current ratio of the photodetectors based on Sn-perovskites is very low.26,34–36,47,48 As an example, photodetectors based on (PEA)2SnI4 microsheets showed an on/off current ratio of ∼10 under 18.6 mW cm−2 illumination at −5 V.36

Further, in order to know the anti-water stability of TBASnCl3 QDs, their water contact angle was measured and it is 75.63°, as shown in Fig. 7(a), demonstrating the enhanced hydrophobicity of TBASnCl3 QDs. Certainly, the quality of TBASnCl3 QDs can be improved further in the near future after in-depth research in this field. Therefore, TBASnCl3 QDs will be promising for next-generation lead-free perovskite optoelectronics. The device still maintains 79% of its original current performance after exposure to an environment with an air humidity of 60% even for 7 days, as shown in Fig. 7(b). As compared with other similar Sn(II)-based photodetectors, such as those photodetectors made in a glove box, significant progress has been achieved for the stability of tin(II)-based photodetectors.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have synthesized novel ligand-free TBASnCl3 QDs with high air-stability and water-stability in an indoor environment, and their potential application in high-performance solution-processed UVC photodetectors Au/TBASnCl3/Au was demonstrated. Through adjusting the SnF2 concentration in the precursors for synthesizing TBASnCl3 QDs, the maximum R of 7.3 mA W−1 with a D* of 1.67 × 1011 Jones was obtained under 0.36 mW cm−2 254 nm illumination at −5 V. The device still maintains 79% of its original current performance after it is placed in an environment with an air humidity of 60% even for 7 days, showing a long lifetime. The enhanced stability and photoelectric performance of the Sn-perovskites are mainly due to the fact that the introduction of TBA+ and SnF2 can suppress the high-oxidation-related Sn4+ formation and the concentration of Sn vacancies. Thus, ligand-free TBASnCl3 QDs provide a promising way of fabricating high-performance, stable, and environment friendly Sn(II)-based optoelectronic devices.
