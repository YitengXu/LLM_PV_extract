    , Accepted 27th May 2020First published on 27th May 2020AbstractExcessive stress has deteriorated the energy crisis and environmental problems; therefore, introducing a new rechargeable battery system for large-scale energy storage and electric vehicles (EVs) has become a major concern. Recently, phosphorus (P) anode as one of the promising candidates for fast-charging lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has gained significant attention for safe EVs due to its low cost, high energy density and relatively high lithiation voltage (ca. 0.7 V vs. Li+/Li). However, its flammability, unavoidable side reactions with the electrolyte and large volumetric variation (∼300%) during cycling limit its large-scale employment. Herein, a localized high-concentration flame-retardant LiFSI-based electrolyte has been reported to simultaneously construct an elastic and robust LiF-rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) both at the P anode and sulfur cathode. Thus, a new Li3P-sulfur full battery system based on the pre-lithiated P anode and the sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) cathode was built, delivering a high capacity retention of 97.1% after 600 cycles at 1 A g−1. This battery system avoids some fatal flaws of the Li–S battery, including Li dendrite formation and thermal instability. This work provides an alternative direction to obtain green and long-life batteries for commercial availability.
Introduction
The rapid consumption of fossil fuels and the accompanying pollution problems such as the emission of greenhouse gases, NOx and SOx, have affected the human society significantly. The use of solar energy, the original energy source, which is abundant and clean, is regarded as one of the prospective methods to mitigate these problems. However, oversupply is expected to occur during the day when the anticipated generation exceeds the real-time demand, as shown in the curve in Fig. 1a. To alleviate this problem, the development of a new power battery storage system is significant to restore the balance between supply and demand, realizing the effective and green use of energy.1–4 As shown in Fig. 1b, the commercial battery systems based on graphite anodes have theoretical and practical energy densities less than ∼600 W h kg−1 and ∼300 W h kg−1, respectively, which cannot meet the demands for energy storage, especially for electric vehicles (EVs). As a substitute, a new battery system based on a phosphorus (P) anode has gained considerable attention due to its low cost, high energy density and safe lithiation voltage (ca. 0.7 V vs. Li+/Li).5–11 Particularly, the Li3P-sulfur (S) or P-Li2S full battery has been regarded as one of the most promising candidates due to its high energy density, high rate performance and low cost. However, the electrochemical performance of pre-lithiated P–S batteries has seldom been reported and is less acceptable than those of conventional Li–S batteries. This is attributed to the following reasons: (i) the kinetics of the solvable polysulfide-involved side reaction with the lithiated P anode is faster than that with the Li metal due to its larger surface area;12 (ii) ether-based electrolytes, such as DOL–DME electrolytes, which are frequently used for Li–S batteries with S/carbon composite cathodes, are not properly compatible with P anodes (Fig. 1c) because an effective solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer cannot be formed in such electrolytes due to the high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level;13 (iii) the commonly used carbonate solvents with LiPF6 impede the electrochemical performances of the S cathode due to the side reactions of the electrolyte and the continuous growth of the cathode electrode interface (Fig. 1d).

Previous studies have reported that both the sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@PAN) cathode14 and the P anode15 are compatible with ester electrolytes and exhibit a long-term cycle life. A new battery system using a pre-lithiated P anode, an S@PAN cathode and an ester electrolyte can be reasonable and promising towards practical applications. Very recently, a 1 M LiPF6/EC-DMC + FEC–VC electrolyte was reported as a feasible electrolyte for pre-lithiated P–S full batteries.16 Although the FEC17 and VC13 additives are effective in forming a stable SEI at the surface of the anodes, this inevitably decreases the initial coulombic efficiency (CE) of the electrode, and the hydrogen fluoride (HF) formed due to the decomposition of FEC causes safety issues. Furthermore, LiPF6 is extremely sensitive to traces of moisture, alcohol and water18,19 and is autocatalytically decomposed into reactive species (i.e., HF), further promoting side reactions with electrodes, electrolytes and binders.20 Particularly, at elevated temperatures, the battery failure is accelerated obviously via the decomposition of FEC catalyzed by the Lewis acid PF5, a byproduct of LiPF6 produced after heating.21 Therefore, finding a safe and effective electrolyte system plays a critical role in the development of both Li–P half cells and lithiated P–S full batteries.
Herein, a high-flash-point 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) “inert” co-solvent was added to a high-concentration bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (LiFSI)-triethyl phosphate (TEP) electrolyte, developing a localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE) of LiFSI-TEP/TTE for both the P anode and the Li3P-S full cell. TEP was introduced to enhance the safety of P or S electrodes; meanwhile, TTE was utilized to alleviate the shuttle effect of S cathodes. With this green and compatible electrolyte (Table S1†), in the case of an Li–P half-cell, the RP anodes delivered reversible discharge capacities of 1071.1 mA h g−1 and 781.8 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at the current densities of 1 A g−1 and 3 A g−1, respectively, which were based on the total mass of the RP and CNT composite. These electrochemical performances were superior to those of most reported nanostructured P-based anodes in LiPF6-based electrolytes.11,22–28 Moreover, when coupled with an S@PAN cathode, the Li3P-S full battery maintained 720 mA h g−1 specific capacity (based on the mass of S) and ∼97.1% retention after 600 cycles at 1 A g−1, demonstrating its superior cycle life. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the application of LHCE for a P anode and Li3P-S full battery. This facile LHCE simultaneously improved the safety, cycle life and electrochemical performance of P-based fast-charging LIBs and Li3P-S full batteries.
Methods/experimental
Electrode preparation
Commercial RP was washed with 5 wt% NaOH solution and distilled water to remove oxides. Subsequently, zirconium oxide balls, RP (0.7 g) and CNTs (0.3 g) were put into a zirconium oxide vessel (0.1 L), which was sealed in an Ar-filled glove box and mixed at a rotation rate of 400 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 12 h using a high energy ball-milling instrument.
The S/CNT composite was fabricated by mixing S and CNTs at an S content of 70 wt%.
Poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN, Mw 150000, Aldrich) and elemental S were homogeneously mixed by ball milling at a weight ratio of 1:8 for 6 h. The mixed powder was then heated at 300 °C for 7.5 h in an N2 atmosphere to prepare an S@PAN composite cathode. The as-prepared S@PAN composite with an S content of 52.1 wt% was ball-milled before Electrode preparation.
Electrolyte preparation
LiPF6-EC/DEC electrolyte was commercially obtained. TEP was purified with a re-distillation step under vacuum after its dehydration with calcium hydride (CaH2, Aladdin, AR 95%) in an N2 atmosphere for 6 h at 100 °C. Also, 1 mol L−1 LiFSI-TEP/TTE LHCE was prepared by dissolving an LiFSI salt into distilled TEP and TTE solvents (decided by the volume ratio of 1:3). Similarly, other LHCE samples were prepared, including LIFSI-sulfolane (TMS)/TTE, LIFSI-dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/TTE, LIFSI-dibutyl ether (DBE)/TTE, LITFSI-TEP/TTE, LiFSI-TEP/1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether (C3H4F4O) and LiFSI-TEP/methyl 9-fluorobutyl ether (C5H3F9O) electrolytes. All chemicals and related experiments were performed in an Ar-filled glove box with less than 0.1 ppm O2 and H2O.
Electrochemical measurements
Electrochemical tests were performed using coin (CR 2032) cells with RP/CNT (working electrode) and Li foil (counter/reference electrode). The working electrode was composed of RP/CNT powder, carbon black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder with a mass ratio of 7:2:1, respectively, in N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. The mass loading of the active material was around 0.5–0.7 mg cm−2 on the Cu foil. The S/CNT composite was mixed with PVDF at a weight ratio of 9:1, respectively, in NMP solvent to form a slurry and cast onto carbon-coated aluminum foils. After drying in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 24 h, the electrodes were cut into circular pieces (areal S loadings ∼2 mg cm−2). In addition, the S@PAN cathode was fabricated by mixing the S@PAN composite, carbon black and PVDF in a mass ratio of 8:1:1, respectively, in NMP solvent. The mass loading of the S@PAN active materials was around 0.8 mg cm−2 on the carbon-coated aluminum foil. The pre-lithiated P anodes after the initial cycle and S@PAN cathodes were used to assemble Li3P-S full cells. Galvanostatic discharge/charge measurements were performed on a Land battery test system between 0.01 and 3 V at the room temperature of 25 °C. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed in the range of 0.01–3 V using an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E, CH Instruments Inc., Shanghai, China). The capacity in the full cell was calculated according to the mass of the S@PAN cathode.
Physical characterizations
The microstructures of the electrodes were visualized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). To identify the chemical bonds of the prepared composite electrodes, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using a Kratos-Axis spectrometer with monochromatic Al Kα (1486.71 eV) radiation (operating current and voltage of 10 mA and 15 kV, respectively). Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was conducted at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under an N2 atmosphere to analyse the thermal stability of the electrolytes. Raman spectra were recorded on a Raman spectrometer (Finder Insight, ZOLIX) using 532 nm excitation. The contact angles were measured by using a contact angle meter (Dataphysics OCA 15EC).
Theoretical calculations
All calculations were performed with the Materials Studio using the density functional theory (DFT). The electron exchange and correlation interaction were processed by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) pseudopotentials within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). After checking for convergence, 500 eV was chosen as the cut-off energy of the plane-wave basis for the Kohn–Sham states. Atomic relaxation was performed until the difference in the total energy was <0.01 meV, and each atomic force was <0.01 eV Å−1.
Results and discussion
The charge–discharge curves of the RP/CNT composite in LiPF6-EC/DEC and LiFSI-TEP/TTE electrolytes are illustrated in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. An initial discharge specific capacity of 1401.2 mA h g−1 based on the total mass of the composite was delivered in the LiPF6-EC/DEC electrolyte at 1 A g−1. The reversible discharge capacities corresponding to 2nd, 5th, 10th, 30th, 60th, and 100th cycles were 1173.7, 1112.0, 1051.0, 916.9, 743.6 and 524.9 mA h g−1, respectively. However, the reversible discharge capacities corresponding to 1st, 2nd, 5th, 10th, 30th, 60th, and 100th cycles were 1353.8, 1128.7, 1130.5, 1106.1, 1072.0, 1059.1 and 1073.4 mA h g−1, respectively, in the LiFSI-TEP/TTE electrolyte. Impressively, no obvious changes in the overpotential were observed in this electrolyte during cycling, indicating its adaptability for the RP anode. The RP/CNT anode in the LiFSI-TEP/TTE electrolyte delivered outstanding specific capacity as well as a capacity retention of 95.1% from the 2nd cycle to the 100th cycle, which was apparently higher than the capacity retention of 44.7% in the LiPF6-EC/DEC electrolyte (Fig. 2c). The rate performance of RP/CNT in the LiFSI-TEP/TTE electrolyte is shown in Fig. 2d. This electrolyte system could deliver stable discharge capacities of 1480.4, 1181.7, 1107.0, 1018.3, 853.0 and 713.5 mA h g−1 at the current densities of 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 and 7000 mA g−1, respectively, equivalent to 0.08 C, 0.18 C, 0.39 C, 0.77 C, 1.93 C and 2.70 C. After high-rate cycling, the reversible capacity recovered to 1100.3 mA h g−1 when the current density decreased to 200 mA g−1 again. The impressive rate performance indicated that this electrolyte had good tolerance during high-rate cycling. This superiority was further validated by the cycling performance at a high current density of 3 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 2e, a high reversible capacity of 781.8 mA h g−1 remains after 200 cycles, which is ∼22 times higher than that of the same P-based anode in the LiPF6-EC/DEC electrolyte. This excellent fast-charging performance was superior to those of most reported nanostructured P anodes in LiPF6-based electrolytes (Fig. S1†). In addition, the LiFSI-TEP/TTE electrolyte showed more stable electrochemical performance than the LiPF6-EC/DEC electrolyte even at a low current density of 0.2 A g−1 for the RP/CNT anode (Fig. S2†), further demonstrating its superior adaptability for the RP anode during both low and high rate cycling processes.

To further explore the influences of lithium salts, solvents and diluents on the electrochemical performances of the RP anodes, LiTFSI-TEP/TTE (Fig. S2†), LIFSI-TMS/TTE (Fig. S3a†), LIFSI-DMC/TTE (Fig. S3b†), LIFSI-DBE/TTE (Fig. S3c†), LiFSI-TEP/C5H3F9O (Fig. S4a and S4c†) and LiFSI-TEP/C3H4F4O (Fig. S4b and S4d†) electrolytes were prepared for comparison. As shown in Fig. S2–S5,† LIFSI-TEP/TTE exhibits the best electrochemical performance among all the electrolytes. The LiFSI salt contributed to the formation of a stable LiF-containing SEI,29 which could enhance the interfacial stability of the P electrodes,30 due to the high Li+ surface diffusivity and high shear modulus (55.1 GPa) of LiF. The TEP solvent easily coordinated with Li+ to form a solvate (Fig. S6a†). The TEP flame-retardant solvent was introduced to enhance the thermal stability of the electrolyte (Fig. S6b†). By increasing the molar ratio of Li+/TEP, the free TEP solvent became increasingly scarce with even FSI− participating in the coordination to generate an ion-solvent-coordinated electrolyte, further improving the safety of batteries.31 In addition, to improve the wettability of the ion-solvent-coordinated electrolyte, a TTE diluent was added to this system, as revealed by the corresponding smaller contact angles (Fig. S6c†).
SEI has a critical impact on the electrode stability.32,33 To elucidate the underlying decomposition mechanism of the LiFSI-TEP/FEC electrolyte contributing to the formation of SEI, DFT calculations and XPS were carried out. The molecular orbital energies of EC, DEC, TTE, TEP, LiPF6 and LiFSI were calculated through DFT. Fig. 3a shows the values of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy and LUMO energy. LiFSI with a low LUMO value (−1.947 eV) was more easily reduced on the surface of the anode than LiPF6 (−1.763 eV). Thus, the preferential reduction of FSI− resulted in an LiF-containing SEI film on the P anode surface. Previous literature has reported that LiF is considered to be a key component in SEI to effectively suppress Li dendrite formation due to its high stability and lithium-ion conduction;34 therefore, LiF could serve as a protective layer to restrain the side reactions between the electrolyte and the P anode. In addition, the structure of a solvated ion has a critical effect on SEI formation.35 TTE as a diluent in the electrolyte system showed very weak interactions with other components. This “inert” diluent had a minimal effect on the aggregation of Li+–TEP solvates because of its low donor number and low dielectric constant.36 Hence, to further understand the solvation behaviours of Li+ with the TEP solvent, the free energy of solvation (Es) was theoretically calculated using the DFT method with the following expression:Es = Etotal − ELi − nETEP.
 Fig. 3  (a) The LUMO and HOMO energy values of EC, DEC, TEP, TTE, LiPF6 and LiFSI obtained by DFT simulations. (b) Solvation energy and LUMO energy of Li ion-solvated TEP. 
Here, Etotal, ELi, and ETEP are the total energy of Li+ and the solvent, the energy of Li+ alone, and the energy of a TEP solvent molecule, respectively, and n is the coordination number. According to this definition, a more negative value of Es indicates a more energetically favourable (stable) solvation molecule. In accordance with previous results where one Li+ usually coordinates with maximum three or four solvent molecules, a four-coordinated [Li–4TEP]+ solvation structure is a stable configuration because of its most negative Es values (Fig. 3b).37 The relative thermodynamic stability of the above-mentioned [Li–TEP]+ complexes on the P anode surface was roughly estimated by the LUMO values, in which the lowest LUMO value was preferentially reduced. The calculation results showed that the [Li–4TEP]+ solvated cations displayed a lower LUMO energy level (−2.806 eV) than LiFSI (−1.947 eV), suggesting that the solvated cations demonstrated decreased stability and were more likely to decompose. Therefore, the formation of SEI films could be regulated by the [Li–4TEP]+ solvation structure. The predictions uncovered the underlying protection mechanism of TEP for the P anode from a molecular-scale perspective. In addition, the molar ratio of the [Li–4TEP]+ solvate to LiFSI was 9:16 in this electrolyte system (Table S2†). The preferential reduction of the [Li–4TEP]+ solvation structure and the subsequent reduction deposition of LiFSI resulted in a favourable and stable LiF-containing SEI on the RP anode surface. XPS was used to acquire the chemical information of SEI on the P anode (Fig. 4). The P 2p spectra of SEI in the case of LiPF6-EC/DEC comprised peaks for LixPFy (137.1 eV) and phosphorus oxyfluoride (OPF) species (133.9 eV).38 Meanwhile, the peaks in the F 1s spectra were attributed to organic fluorides (686.9 eV) and LiF (684.7 eV).39 In contrast to the SEI component in the LiPF6-EC/DEC electrolyte, the SEI component in the LiFSI-TEP/FEC electrolyte was mainly LiF along with small amounts of organic species. Notably, LixPFy species were not detected in the P 2p spectrum of the P anode in the case of the LiFSI-TEP/TTE electrolyte. The detected LixPFy species might be irreversibly formed at the surface of the P particles upon long-term cycling due to the reaction of the surface P species with HF. This may be the main reason for the capacity fading of the P anode upon long-term cycling in the LiPF6-EC/DEC electrolyte, particularly at high current densities such as 3 A g−1.

Considering the remarkable improvements in both the Li–S40 and Li–P half cells in LHCE, the Li3P-S full cell configuration was investigated to demonstrate the advantages of LHCE for P-based anodes. Given that the initial CE of Li–P half cells was 83.54%, the P anode was pre-lithiated vs. Li metal in the half cells for 1 cycle to mitigate the challenges from SEI formation and then reassembled into Li3P-S full cells. The assembled full cell delivered a high reversible capacity of 728.6 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 600 cycles, corresponding to 97.1% capacity retention, and the CE approached 99% in stable cycles (Fig. 5a and b). No obvious voltage polarization was observed from the 10th cycle to the 600th cycle, which was ascribed to the good interface between the electrodes and the electrolyte (Fig. 5b). Notably, the S@PAN composite cathode often underwent obvious voltage hysteresis in the first discharge cycle. After the initial adjustment, the conductivity of the S cathode improved, and the discharge process displayed an elevated platform.41 In contrast to the conventional S/CNT cathode, the S@PAN cathode underwent a different lithiation/de-lithiation process due to the presence of mono-dispersed molecular S. It realized direct solid–solid conversion, thus effectively circumventing the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The electrodes after 600 cycles were investigated by SEM, in which no obvious pulverization or fractures were observed for both the P anode and the S cathode (Fig. 5c and e). The excellent cycling performance of the Li3P-S full battery was highly relevant to the structural stability. The thickness of the deposited layer on the S cathode was higher than the thickness of the deposited layer on the P anode (Fig. 5d and f) possibly due to the larger size of the S@PAN particles. The denser P anode structure than the S@PAN cathode was possibly due to the larger volumetric expansion of the P anode (300%) than that of the S cathode (80%) during cycling.

To gain further insights into the compositions of SEI films after cycling, XPS was performed by continuous etching from 0 s to 200 s, as demonstrated in Fig. 6 and Fig. S7.† On increasing the etching time, interestingly, the formation of the Li–P–S compound was detected on the P surface,42 whereas this species was not detected on the S surface. This may be attributed to the reaction between the Li3P species and the dissolved polysulfides. The peak for the Li–P–S compound is evident in the P 2p spectrum of the P anode. The Li–P–S compound is considered as a good Li-ion conductor, which is beneficial for enhancing the ion transport properties of SEI. In the F 1s spectra, the LiF species were verified as the main SEI component, leading to a compact and elastic interface layer on both the P anode and the S cathode. The robust LiF-rich SEI was demonstrated to accommodate the volumetric changes of the P anode15 and stabilize the structural integrity of the S cathode.43 Based on these advantages, the superior performance was ascribed to the synergistic effects of all the components in this electrolyte and its adaptability for both the P anode and the S cathode, where this electrolyte minimized the solubility of polysulfides (Fig. 5g),40,44 strengthened the interfacial stability between the electrodes, and suppressed the volumetric expansion of the electrodes through the formation of a robust SEI on the surface.

Even though the lithiated P/S full battery possessed a low voltage, its advantages of high capacity, low cost, and environmental friendliness show that it has great potential in large-scale energy storage. In addition, although the energy density of this Li3P/S full cell presented a lower voltage than that of the Li–S battery, it still presented potential as a practical alternative with distinct advantages when compared to the Li–S battery. (i) The Li3P/S battery used P as the Li-hosting material, which effectively circumvented the Li dendrite formation and provided improved safety. (ii) The Li3P/S battery avoided the utilization of excess metal Li to boost performance, and the capacities of both electrodes matched; this is compatible with the industrial standards for large-scale energy storage. (iii) Due to the utilization of a flame-retardant electrolyte in this system, our full cell presented great potential in the high-temperature battery field. At an elevated temperature (at least 60 °C), the battery system may be feasible and attractive due to the enhanced reaction kinetics. It is worthwhile to mention that increasing the S content in the S@PAN cathode is significant for further improving its capacity based on the whole composite. There are two methods for increasing the S content in the S@PAN cathode. (i) A hierarchical topological design of PAN theoretically indicates more S accommodation; (ii) an alternative to the SeSx@PAN composite cathode will be promising owing to its higher active content and stable performance.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the preparation of a non-flammable localized high-concentration electrolyte. Besides the significantly improved safety, the P anode showed excellent fast-charging performance. A high capacity retention of 94.9% from the 2nd cycle to the 200th cycle at 1 A g−1 and a high reversible capacity of 781.8 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 3 A g−1 were delivered. When coupled with a sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) cathode, the Li3P-S full battery maintained 97.1% capacity retention after 600 cycles at 1 A g−1, demonstrating the superior cycling stability. The established new Li3P-S full battery with a high energy density of about 648 W h kg−1, high rate performance and low cost shows great promise in large-scale energy storage and electric vehicles.
