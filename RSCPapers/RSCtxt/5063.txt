    , Accepted 13th January 2012First published on 16th January 2012AbstractNano-roughened Teflon-like film coated poly-crystalline Si photovoltaic solar cells (PVSCs) with enhanced surface hydrophobicity and conversion efficiency (η) are characterized and compared with those coated by a Si nanorod array or a standard SiN anti-reflection layer. The Teflon-like film coated PVSC surface reveals a water contact angle increasing from 89.3° to 96.2° as its thickness enlarges from 22 to 640 nm, which is much larger than those of the standard and Si nanorod array coated PVSC surfaces (with angles of 55.6° and 32.8°, respectively). After nano-roughened Teflon-like film passivation, the PVSC shows a comparable η(10.89%) with the standard SiN coated PVSC (η = 11.39%), while the short-circuit current (ISC) is slightly reduced by 2% owing to the slightly decreased UV transmittance and unchanged diode performance. In contrast, the Si nanorod array may offer an improved surface anti-reflection with surface reflectance decreasing from 30% to 5% at a cost of optical scattering and randomized deflection, which simultaneously decrease the optical transmittance from 15% to 3% in the visible region without improving hydrophobicity and conversion efficiency. The Si nanorod array covered PVSC with numerous surface dangling bonds induced by 1 min wet-etching, which greatly reduces the open-circuit voltage (VOC) by 10–15% and ISC by 30% due to the reduced shunt resistance from 3 to 0.24 kΩ. The nano-scale roughened Teflon-like film coated on PVSC has provided better hydrophobicity and conversion efficiency than the Si nanorod array covered PVSC, which exhibits superior water repellant performance and comparable conversion efficiency to be one alternative approach for self-cleaning PVSC applications.
1. Introduction
The nano-scale roughened surface with anti-reflective, haze and hydrophobic characteristics is indeed one potential candidate to cover the multiple functionalities required for the photovoltaic solar cells (PVSCs).1–5 Since 1992, Green et al.6 have preliminarily demonstrated the improved conversion performance of Si based photovoltaic cells with a pyramid textured surface, which emphasized the contribution of the reduced reflection as well as enhanced transmission on the nano-pyramid surface. Nevertheless, it has been recently observed that the surface nano-roughened structure could also degrade the transmission if the nano-corrugation is too large to induce an extremely large scattering. In recent years, various techniques have been developed to prepare roughened structures on the surface of different materials,7–12 in which the principle processing tools include the chemical deposition and the physical evaporation.13 However, the environmental limitations such as high temperature, complex system, rigorous recipes, or slow textured growth are usually associated with the proposed approaches. A simplified synthesis of large-area Si nanostructure was demonstrated by employing the metal-dendrite-assisted growth in previous work,13 which allows the maskless self-assembly under nano-electrochemistry growth.13 Similar large-area oriented Si nano-wire (SiNW) structures were successively developed to function as the p–n junction,14 the photoelectrochemical cells15 and the anti-reflection (AR) coating.16 The first SiNW based PVSC reported in 2005 indeed shows an alternative approach to the mandatory AR coating, however, which fails to promote the expected conversion efficiency higher than others without a roughened surface. This observation has led to a re-evaluation on the compromise between optical and electrical properties of such nano-roughened semiconductors. In more detail, the numerous surface defects and dangling bonds around the SiNW surface are simultaneously generated, which could inevitably enhance the non-radiative electron–hole recombination rate to degrade energy conversion efficiency.15 On the other hand, the fluoride or oxide compounds were considered to serve as the passivation and water repellant layers for protecting the PVSC surface.17–20 Among the existing candidates, the Teflon-like ultra-thin coating with high adhesion and strong stability could not only passivate the sample surface and avert the degradation of surface coatings,18 but also resist the penetration of water or moisture from the high-humidity environment.20
In this work, both the nano-roughened ultra-thin Teflon-like coatings and Si nanorod arrays with super-hydrophobic property are utilized to compare their enhancement on surface hydrophobicity and conversion efficiency of the poly-crystalline Si based PVSCs. To passivate the surface dangling bonds, the ultra-thin Teflon-like film coatings with high hydrophobic property are synthesized on the semi-manufactured PVSC surface using a modified chemical vapor deposition under trifluoromethane (CHF3) fluence. For comparison, the silver (Ag) dendrite-assisted wet etching process is applied to directly prepare the nano-roughened Si structure with great AR ability upon semi-manufactured PVSCs. Afterwards, the optical and electrical characteristics of the poly-crystalline PVSCs with and without the ultra-thin Teflon-like film or Si nanorod are compared. The optical transparent property of the nano-roughened structures upon the crystalline Si (c-Si) covered quartz substrate are also investigated. In comparison with the unexpected degradation of the Si nanorod surface roughened poly-crystalline Si PVSC, the mechanism corresponding to the better energy conversion efficiency of the nano-roughened Teflon-like film coated poly-crystalline Si PVSC is elucidated.
2. Experiment details
To enhance both the surface hydrophobicity and anti-reflection properties of the PVSC surface, either the deposited Teflon-like film or the wet-etched Si nanorod structure are fabricated on the semi-manufactured poly-crystalline Si PVSC, as shown in Fig. 1. For Teflon-like film deposition to passivate the surface dangling bonds, the trifluoromethane (CHF3) based plasma technology21 is modified to synthesize the ultra-thin Teflon-like film on the semi-manufactured poly-crystalline Si PVSC surface. By placing the PVSC in a reactive ion etcher (RIE, Trion Phantom III) chamber at a substrate temperature of 400 °C, the CHF3 is decomposed to deposit the nano-roughened Teflon-like film under working fluence, pressure, and RF power of 100 sccm, 2.5 × 10−2 Torr, and 250 W, respectively. By employing the Ag dendrite-assisted wet-etching procedure13 shown in Fig. 1(b), the surface-roughened Si nanorod array (etching the Si film on PVSC grown by LINDBER, No:55667) is also employed to function as the alternative anti-reflection and hydrophobic surface on the semi-manufactured poly-crystalline Si PVSC. Initially, the semi-manufactured PVSC was coated with photoresist to protect its electrode and then etched in the HF and AgNO3 based aqueous solution at 50 °C with HF/AgNF3 concentrations set as 4.6/0.02 mole L−1. With the successive four catholic and/or anodic chemical reactions described as 2H+ + 2e− → H2 (hydrogen evolution), Ag+ + e− → Ag0 (reduction of Ag+ ions), Si + 2F− → SiF2 + 2e− (the oxidation of Si), Si + 2F− + 2H+ → SiF2 (the hole consuming), the Ag atoms self-aggregate into nano-particles and the highly randomized pores emerged on the poly-crystalline Si PVSC substrate surface. The nano-roughened Si nanorod array is gradually formed on the PVSC surface by further dissolving the PVSC with lengthened etching time, whereas the self-aggregated Ag particles are continually enlarged and merged into large dendrites to locally cover the PVSC surface until whole reaction ceases.

The solar energy conversion efficiency of the Teflon-like film or Si nanorod array coated poly-crystalline Si PVSC was measured using a solar simulator with a standard AM1.5 spectrum and an I–V multimeter under 1000 W m−2 at 25 °C. The properties of the hydrophobic effect and wavelength dependent transmittance are also discussed. To investigate the optical transmission of the Teflon-like film or Si nanorod array on the quartz substrate (see Fig. 2), the diagnosis of reflectance and transmittance was measured by using a spectrometer (JASCO V-670 UV-visible spectrometer) to understand the degradation of I–V performance of the semi-manufactured poly-crystalline PVSC with its surface passivated by the Teflon-like film or the Si nanorod array.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural analysis of the nano-scale roughened Teflon-like film coated surface
The analytical results of atomic-force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for the Teflon-like film fabricated by using CHF3 plasma are presented in Fig. 3(a) and (b) The observed spectral intensities of C1S (284.8 eV) and F1S (684.9 eV) electron energy spectral peaks infer the compositional ratio of carbon and fluorine atoms in the Teflon-like film. For the Teflon-like film synthesized with decomposed CHF3 plasma, the AFM image of the nano-roughened surface suggests that the Teflon-like surface may be covered by high cross-linking structure with root-mean-square roughness (Rrms) of 1.4 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (c). According to the literature,22 Lee et al. indicated that the appropriate control of the CHF3 plasma fluence during the synthesis of the Teflon-like film is mandatory, which not only effectively enhances the F/C atomic ratio and –CF2 functional groups but also produces a roughened surface and superior hydrophobic properties. In more detail, the fine scanning and peak deconvolution of the C1S electron energy peak shown in Fig. 3(c) are performed to study the variation of chemical components on the Teflon-like film surface. The decomposed C1S core-level electron energy spectra illustrated in Fig. 3(c) show multiple Lorentzian sub-peaks given by different bonds shown in Fig. 3(d), in which four dominant groups of –CF2, –CF–, –C–CFx, and C–C (sp3) can be observed with their corresponding bond energies of 292.6, 290.1, 287.5, and 285.7 eV respectively. The fine-scanning and decomposed XPS signal confirms that the chemical structure of the Teflon-like film is very close to the commercial Teflon with high cross-links.23

Secondly, the transmittance and hydrophobicity of the ultra-thin and nano-roughened Teflon-like film are investigated. The optical transmission spectra of the nano-roughened Teflon-like films with thickness ranging between 22 and 640 nm are shown in Fig. 4(a) which shows >99% transmittance in the green-red visible wavelength region (500–760 nm). Even in the worst case, the blue light at a wavelength of 400 nm can penetrate through the 216 nm thick Teflon-like film with a transmittance up to 90%. When reducing the film thickness down to 83 nm or less, the >95% transmission can be found at the ultraviolet region. In contrast, the Si nanorod array roughened surface fails to contribute sufficiently high transmittance when compared with the Teflon-like film. As shown in Fig. 5, although the Si nanorod roughened surface can significantly suppress its surface reflectance from 40% to 10% by lengthening the nanorod length with increasing etching duration from 1 to 5 minutes (Fig. 5(b)), the optical transmittance simultaneously decreases down to 5% or less due to the strong scattering effect of light suffered during passing through the Si nanorod array (Fig. 5(a)). Even the decrease of Si nanorod length (i.e. the Si nanorod film thickness) cannot make its optical transmittance as high as that of the nano-roughened Teflon-like film, such that the incident light is hardly penetrated through the Si nanorod array for exciting electron–hole pairs for solar energy conversion. The Si nanorod surface seems to induce a destructive interference for reducing surface reflectance but could also shadow the incident light penetrating into the inner layer of the poly-crystalline24Si PVSC. The superior low-attenuation characteristics guarantee the Teflon-like film for PVSC application, however, the critical thickness required to preserve the surface hydrophobicity of the Teflon-like film also needs to be considered.

To check the surface hydrophobicity of the nano-roughened Teflon-like film, we employ the cross-sectional contact angle analysis of the water drop on the Teflon-like film surface, as shown in Fig. 4(b). In comparison with the Si wafer, the water contact angle enlarges from 55.6° to 92.6° as the Teflon-like film thickness increases up to 216 nm. The maximum water repellant angle can be up to 94.6° when making the Teflon-like film thicker, however, which simultaneously reduces the optical transmission to cause degradation of solar energy conversion efficiency. Without any specific treatment, the Si nanorod array fails to promote the water repellant function of the poly-crystalline Si PVSC surface, leaving the water drop closely adhered on the substrate with infinitely small water contact angle. The combined effect of the Si nanorod array25,26 behaves like spreading a layer of black paint on the PVSC surface, which provides an anti-reflection like function but contributes less to the efficiency of solar energy conversion.
3.2 
          I–V characteristics of the nano-roughened Teflon film coated poly-Si solar-cell
Either the Teflon-like film or the Si nanorod array is applied to the semi-manufactured poly-crystalline Si PVSC not only for the surface anti-reflection but also for the hydrophobicity. Except the use of the ultra-thin and nano-roughened Teflon-like film to passivate the existence of numerous surface dangling bonds (so as to decrease the surface electron–hole recombination velocity)16 the effect of the passivated layer thickness on the degradation of I–V characteristics of the PVSC needs to be minimized. First of all, the Teflon-like films with different thickness are made on the standard semi-manufactured poly-crystalline Si PVSCs for optimizing the I–V characteristics, as shown in Fig. 6(a) and Table 1. The semi-manufactured poly-crystalline Si PVSC without any surface passivation and anti-reflection exhibits a solar energy conversion efficiency of only 9.8%. Using a standard SiN layer coating, the fill factor (FF) and energy conversion efficiency (η) of a standard cell are 0.69 and 11.39%. The synthesis of the ultra-thin and nano-roughened Teflon-like film (with thickness of 22 nm) on the semi-manufactured poly-crystalline Si PVSC effectively promotes the conversion efficiency to 10.89%. However, the short-circuit current of the PVSC further decreases by increasing Teflon-like film thickness to 83 nm or larger, indicating that the electron–hole generation is somewhat suppressed in the conversion layer. Although the open-circuit voltage can be slightly improved in this case, which contributes very few increments of the filling factor. As a result, the conversion efficiency of the semi-manufactured poly-crystalline Si PVSCs slightly decreases from 10.89% to 9.33% with the Teflon-like film thickness increasing from 22 to 216 nm. Such degradation can be directly correlated with the lower optical transmittance in UV and visible wavelength region after depositing the thicker Teflon-like film. In combination with the former experiments on the compromise between optical transmittance and surface hydrophobicity, the 22 nm-thick Teflon-like film is considered as the best candidate for fabricating self-cleaning poly-crystalline Si PVSCs without sacrificing its conversion efficiency. The 22 nm thick Teflon-like film has shown a comparable response with the standard SiN coated poly-crystalline Si PVSC (with an efficiency deviation less than −0.5%), which further provides a water-repellant surface to strengthen the self-cleaning function of the PVSC.

In contrast, the I–V characteristics of the Si nanorod array passivated poly-crystalline Si PVSCs under the illumination of a solar simulator are shown in Fig. 6(b) with the corresponding parameters summarized in Table 2. The FF and η of the Si nanorod array roughened poly-crystalline PVSC layer significantly degrade to 0.34 and 0.87%, respectively. Both the FF and η significantly decrease by lengthening the wet etching duration up to 2 minutes, indicating that the Si nanorod array may offer an improved surface anti-reflection at a cost of optical scattering and randomized deflection within the Si nanorod layer. In particular, the degradation of the short-circuit current is severe than that of the open-circuit voltage when lengthening the Si nanorod by increasing the wet-etching duration. The significantly reduced Voc of the Si nanorod array passivated poly-crystalline Si PVSC represents that numerous grain boundaries have generated during the etching process, where the photogenerated carriers flowing through the grand boundary could suffer from a serious trapping and scattering effect to degrade the PVSC performances (i.e. smaller short-circuit current and larger leakage current). In comparison with a standard poly-crystalline Si PVSC, the roughened Si nanorod array surface could inevitably reduce the photocurrent by nearly one order of magnitude. Even with the additional Teflon-like film coating, the solar energy conversion performance cannot be improved anymore, as shown in Fig. 7. That is, the degraded conversion efficiency is not attributed to the surface dangling bonds distributed on the Si nanorod array, whereas the optical scattering effect plays a more important role in the incident photons to repulse its penetration and conversion in an active layer. In contrast, the Teflon-like film only degrades the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage by less than 2%, whereas the surface hydrophobicity and self-cleaning ability can be greatly enhanced. The nano-roughened Teflon-like film passivated poly-crystalline Si PVSC with superior water repellant performance, and comparable solar energy conversion efficiency can thus be one alternative approach for future self-cleaning PVSC applications.

4. Conclusions
The nano-roughened ultra-thin Teflon-like coatings and Si nanorod array with super-hydrophobic property are fabricated to compare their effects on surface hydrophobicity and conversion efficiency of the poly-crystalline Si based PVSCs. The ultra-thin Teflon-like film coating with high hydrophobic property is synthesized on the semi-manufactured PVSC surface using a modified chemical vapor deposition under trifluoromethane (CHF3) fluence. For comparison, the nano-roughened Si structure with great AR ability upon semi-manufactured PVSCs is also fabricated on the semi-manufactured PVSC by using a silver (Ag) dendrite-assisted wet etching process. For the Teflon-like film, the AFM image of the nano-roughened surface suggests that the Teflon-like surface may be covered by high cross-linking structure with root-mean-square roughness (Rrms) of 1.4 nm. The XPS shows that the C1S spectral peak is decomposed into four dominant groups of –CF2, –CF–, –C–CFx, and C–C (sp3), which is very close to the commercial Teflon. The optical transmission spectra of the nano-roughened Teflon-like films with thickness ranging between 22 and 640 nm show >99% transmittance in the visible region (500–760 nm). The optical transmittance decreases down to 5% with increasing etching duration from 1 to 5 minutes, because the strong scattering effect of light suffered during passing through the Si nanorod array. For the Teflon-like film, the water contact angles increase from 89.3° to 96.2° as the Teflon-like film thickness increases from 22 to 640 nm in comparison with the untreated wafer, which is much larger than those of the standard and Si nanorod PVSC surfaces with angles of 55.6° and 32.8°, respectively. In comparison, the Si nanorod array roughened surface fails to contribute sufficiently high transmittance and to provide the surface hydrophobicity without further treatment. Lengthening the Si nanorod not only results in a decrease in reflectance from 30% to 5% but also induces a serious scattering effect to degrade the transmittance from 15% to 3% in the visible region.
After passivating by the nano-scale roughened Teflon-like film, the PVSC shows a comparable solar energy conversion efficiency with the standard PVSC with a SiN based coating, in which the Isc is slightly reduced by 2% with the insufficiently increasing Rs by the nano-roughened Teflon-like film. As a reference, a semi-manufactured poly-crystalline Si PVSC without any surface passivation and anti-reflection exhibits a solar energy conversion efficiency of only 9.8%, and the standard SiN layer coating on the semi-manufactured polycrystalline Si PVSC can increase the energy conversion efficiency to 11.39%. The synthesis of the ultra-thin and nano-roughened Teflon-like film (with thickness of 22 nm) on the semi-manufactured poly-crystalline Si PVSC effectively promotes the conversion efficiency to 10.89%. The roughened Teflon-like film only causes a change in serial resistance without degrading the diode performance of the PVSC, such that the degradation of FF and η by surface nano-scale roughened Teflon coating is trivial. In contrast, in the Si nanorod covered PVSC with numerous surface dangling bonds induced by 1 min wet-etching, the short-circuit current is greatly reduced by 30% due to the reduced shunt resistance from 3200 Ω to 240 Ω, whereas the open-circuit voltage only degraded by 10–15%. The Si nanorod array roughened poly-crystalline PVSC layer with an etching time of 2 min significantly degrades its FF and η to 0.34 and 0.87%, respectively. The optical scattering effect within the Si nanorod array inevitably leads to decreasing optical transmittance and degraded conversion efficiency. In particular, numerous grain boundaries generated during the etching process could trap and scatter the photogenerated carriers flowing through the grand boundary, which significantly reduce the short-circuit current. As a result, the 22 nm-thick Teflon-like film exhibits the comparable conversion efficiency and the surface hydrophobicity (water contact angle of 89.3°), which is considered as the best candidate for fabricating self-cleaning poly-crystalline Si PVSCs without sacrificing its conversion efficiency.
