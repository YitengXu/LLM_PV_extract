E-mail: slzhao@bjtu.edu.cnReceived 14th August 2013, Accepted 16th September 2013First published on 17th September 2013AbstractAn asymmetrically substituted squaraine ASQC bearing a 9-carbazyl substituent exhibits an extremely deep HOMO energy level of −5.46 eV and a relatively low bandgap of 1.65 eV, hence renders solution-processed organic solar cells with an impressive Voc of up to 1.12 V and a PCE of 2.82%.Recently, small molecule organic solar cells (SMOSCs) with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) device structure have attracted great interest as promising renewable energy sources due to their unique advantages over their polymer counterparts.1 As fullerene derivatives (e.g., PC61BM and PC71BM) are generally used as electron acceptor materials in BHJ SMOSCs, the corresponding ideal electron donor materials should have three prerequisites: (1) broad and intense absorption in the low energy portion of the solar spectrum to ensure efficient light harvesting; (2) deep HOMO energy levels to render high Voc of OSCs;2 (3) good solubility for solution-processing.Among the multifarious kinds of small molecule donor materials that have been developed, squaraine dyes have drawn much attention,3 since they possess intense and broad absorption bands in the visible and NIR regions, and excellent photochemical and photophysical stability as well.4 So far, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution-processed squaraine-based BHJ-SMOSCs has been as high as 5.50%,5 note that the squaraine dye used in this device has a symmetrical molecular structure (SQ, D–A–D). In fact, compared with SQs, asymmetrical squaraines (ASQs, D–A–D′) could afford more advantages with respect to the fine-tuning of optoelectronic properties,6 and in addition, ASQs often exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents.7 Therefore, ASQs are more promising candidates relative to SQs in many optoelectronic applications such as dye-sensitized solar cells, bioimaging probes, and nonlinear optical materials.8Nevertheless, with regard to BHJ SMOSC applications, much less efforts have been devoted to the exploitation of photoactive ASQs, and to our knowledge, there have been only four relative studies up to now.9 Though all these ASQs possess low bandgaps (1.45–1.63 eV), the PCE of the corresponding BHJ photovoltaic devices is relatively low (0.20–2.05%), which should be mainly ascribed to the relatively low Voc (0.24–0.69 V) stemming from the high HOMO levels of these dyes (−4.96 to −5.17 eV). Therefore, in this work, we attempt to develop ASQs with compromised low bandgaps and deep HOMO levels through molecular tailoring. To render dyes with low bandgaps, 1,1,2-trimethyl-1H-benzo[e]indole with a more extended conjugation system relative to the widely used 2,2,3-trimethylindole10 is used as the D subunit. A 4-amino-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl group is employed as a D′ moiety, so that a planar conformation between squarate cores and phenyl segments could be achieved with the aid of dual hydrogen bond interactions, and consequently render a dye molecule with effectively extended conjugation systems and improved charge carrier transportation.11 In addition, 9-carbazyl, a constructional unit widely used in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) materials,12 but seldom used in photovoltaic materials as an end capper,13 is incorporated into the phenyl group owing to its relatively weak electron-donating capability, excellent hole-transporting ability, and high thermal/morphological/photo-chemical stability, so that the resulting compound ASQC might possess a deep HOMO level and excellent photovoltaic performance. Moreover, to elucidate the role the carbazyl substituent plays in the descending of HOMO levels, a reference compound ASQB with strong electron-donating diisobutylamino instead of carbazyl is constructed,14 and the effect of different electron-donating end cappers, i.e., alkylamino and carbazyl, on the optoelectronic properties of ASQs has been investigated too.The synthetic routes to the target molecules are illustrated in Scheme 1. All the synthetic and characterization details could be found in ESI.† In comparison with the classic SQ dye (DPSQ),3a both ASQB and ASQC show much improved solubility in common organic solvents like chloroform, chlorobenzene and acetone (data given in Table S1, ESI†). Additionally, high quality films of the two target molecules could be obtained through spin-coating from solution, suggesting that they are very suitable for solution-processing. Scheme 1  Synthetic routes to the target molecules. The molecular structures of ASQB and ASQC (videFig. 1) are determined by X-ray diffraction on single crystals of ASQB and ASQC obtained from CH2Cl2–CH3OH and CHCl3–CH3OH, respectively. The bond lengths of C8–N1 (1.413 Å) and C4–C5 (1.433 Å) bonds of ASQC are both observed to be longer than the corresponding ones of ASQB (C27–N2, 1.369 Å; C22–C30, 1.423 Å), implying that carbazyl is indeed less electron-donating than the diisobutylamino group. This deduction is further confirmed by 1H NMR characterization results, since the phenyl ring of ASQB is found to be more electron-rich than that of ASQC (H1 signal: 5.80 ppm for ASQB; 6.55 ppm for ASQC). In both the compounds, the squarate cores and phenyl moieties show a nearly planar conformation (dihedral angles <8°) due to the existence of strong hydrogen bonding interactions (O⋯H–O). Therefore, efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition would occur from D to A subunits, leading to much extended conjugation systems.11 According to the packing diagrams of the compounds (Fig. S1, ESI†), the shortest distance between two neighboring ASQC and ASQB molecules is 3.65 Å and 3.71 Å, respectively, indicative of the presence of π–π interaction, which may facilitate the charge carrier transportation. Fig. 1  ORTEP diagrams of ASQB (left) and ASQC (right). The UV-vis absorption spectra of the two compounds in dilute chloroform solution and thin films are shown in Fig. 2, and data are summarized in Table 1. Although 9-carbazyl shows much weaker electron-donating ability than the diisobutylamino group, the absorption maximum of ASQC is only slightly blue-shifted relative to ASQB (629 nm vs. 656 nm), indicative of the involvement of carbazyl segments in the conjugation system of ASQC. It is noteworthy that absorption bands of ASQC are considerably broader than those of ASQB in both solution (full width at half maximum, FWHM, 2310 cm−1vs. 580 cm−1) and the film state (FWHM, 4460 cm−1vs. 3340 cm−1), which is propitious for light harvesting. Determined by UV-vis absorption onset of the films, the optical bandgaps of ASQC and ASQB are 1.65 eV and 1.55 eV, respectively, both are close to the ideal bandgap (1.50 eV) of photovoltaic materials.2 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of ASQs in solution (left) and thin films (right).

Consequently, compared with ASQB, ASQC should not only exhibit a much broader absorption band,16 but also possess a deeper HOMO level due to the inferior electron-donating capability of carbazyl relative to diisobutylamino groups. Fig. 3  Electronic-density distribution of ASQB (left) and ASQC (right). According to cyclic voltammetry measurements (Table 1 and Fig. S3, ESI†), the HOMO level of ASQC is calculated to be −5.46 eV, which is considerably lower (0.40 eV) than that of ASQB (−5.06 eV), hence much higher Voc could be expected in ASQC-based OSC relative to the ASQB-based one. Moreover, the LUMO level of ASQC is −3.68 eV, which is 0.12 eV lower than that of ASQB, hence more efficient exciton dissociation and charge separation could be realized.2To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the two compounds, devices with a structure of glass/ITO/MoO3 (80 Å)/ASQ:PC71BM (800 Å)/LiF (8 Å)/Al (1000 Å) have been fabricated. The representative photovoltaic data of the devices are summarized in Table S3 (ESI†), and current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The optimized weight ratio of ASQC:PC71BM is 1:5, and the corresponding J–V curves and key data of the devices are given in Fig. 4 and Table 2.

Voc is not only determined by the HOMO–LUMO offset between the donor and PC71BM, but also closely related to the morphology between donor–acceptor (D–A) blend films.17 Thus, the morphological properties of these photoactive blending films have been investigated by AFM (Fig. S5, ESI†), both ASQB and ASQC-based films show similar morphologies and quite smooth surfaces with an analogous root-mean-square (RMS) of 0.52 nm and 0.38 nm, respectively, thus the difference of Voc (0.37 V) between ASQB and ASQC-based devices should be chiefly attributed to the difference of HOMO levels of the two ASQs (0.40 eV). This is, to our knowledge, the highest Voc (1.12 V) of single BHJ SMOSCs based on small molecule donors.18 It is noteworthy that an ASQC-based device also exhibits higher Jsc than that of ASQB (5.81 mA cm−2vs. 5.40 mA cm−2), thus the ASQC-based device shows a much higher PCE than that of ASQB (2.34% vs. 1.54%). The higher Jsc might be assigned to the broader absorption band of ASQC relative to ASQB, and the results are in line with their corresponding EQE curves (Fig. S6, ESI†), the EQE value of the ASQC-based device is higher than that of ASQB in the region of 360–670 nm.According to the experimental and calculation results, the hole mobility of the as-prepared donor–acceptor blending films is relatively low (ASQB/PC71BM, 1.89 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1; ASQC/PC71BM, 2.16 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1; Fig. S7, ESI†). Hence the relatively low incident monochromatic EQE of both the devices should be ascribed to the low carrier mobility of the photoactive films. Note that in both the devices, the as-prepared dye–PC71BM blended films are employed as photoactive layers, therefore, much improved photovoltaic performance should be expected when further optimizations like thermo-annealing, solvent-annealing and incorporation of additives have been carried out. For example, the PCE of the ASQC-device could be enhanced to 2.82% after the active layer has been thermo-annealed at 110 °C for 10 min (Table S3, ESI†). To our knowledge, this is the highest PCE for ASQ-based BHJ SMOSCs,9 suggesting that ASQs are indeed perspective electron donor candidates.In summary, a novel asymmetrical squaraine ASQC with a compromised low HOMO energy level of −5.46 eV and a low bandgap of 1.65 eV has been designed and synthesized. Compared with its reference compound ASQB with a diisobutylamino end capper, ASQC with a 9-carbazyl end capper exhibits a much broader absorption band and a deeper HOMO energy level. Therefore, solution-processed ASQC-based BHJ-SMOSC shows a Voc of 1.12 V and a PCE of 2.82%, while that based on ASQB has a Voc of 0.75 V and a PCE of 1.54%. These preliminary studies demonstrate that ASQs are quite promising candidates for SMOSC application, and their optoelectronic properties could be easily fine-tuned by manipulating the electron-donating character of D and D′ subunits. Moreover, the carbazyl-modification strategy may pave a new way for achieving photovoltaic devices with greatly improved Voc and PCE.We acknowledge the financial support for this work of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (project no. 21072139 and 21190031) and New Century Excellent Talents in University (grant no.
