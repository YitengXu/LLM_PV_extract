The lifetime of conduction band electrons was found to be dependent on the injection method used. Direct band gap excitation results in a lifetime of 2.5 ns, whereas indirect excitation at 532 nm via Ru-N719 dye followed by injection from the dye into TiO2 results in a lifetime of 5.9 ns.
Instigated by the findings of Honda and Fujishima in 1972,1 who used TiO2 for the photo-assisted electrochemical splitting of water, and Grätzel,2 who developed an economical and efficient dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cell, substantial effort has been invested in the study of TiO2 electron dynamics. Dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells increase the range of the solar spectrum that can be harvested to produce electricity (photo-voltaic) but also to produce chemical energy in the form of chemical bonds, e.g. water splitting. For the latter, however, the reaction yields are poor, which is why a metal co-catalyst is often added to the semiconductor.3
Electron dynamics span over a wide time range, from femtoseconds to milliseconds. Injection of electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 can occur either directly by band gap excitation or indirectly by excitation of light absorbing structures, such as dyes, followed by injection of the excited electron into the conduction band. The direct excitation requires UV light due to the large band gap of TiO2 (3.2 eV), whereas indirect injection is most efficient with ruthenium-based dyes, allowing for excitation of photons in the visible range.2
The timescale associated with electron injection by direct excitation of the band gap is a few fs whereas the best performing dyes populate the conduction band on a sub-50 fs timescale.4,5 Bräm et al.6 determined that with Ru-N719 the injection occurs on a sub-10 fs timescale from non-thermalized levels of the dye. Furthermore, they observed a <10 fs intramolecular energy redistribution, which competes with the injection. Its electronic coupling and the energetic position of the injection level with respect to the conduction band minimum, reflecting the density of available acceptor states, govern the injection rate from the dye into TiO2.7 This has a direct influence on the transport and trapping of conduction band electrons that occur on the hundreds of ps timescale.8 The transport depends on the energy of the electrons since they can either be injected as hot electrons (electrons excited into higher energy levels of the conduction band) or cold electrons (electrons excited into lower energy levels of the conduction band), whereas the trapping depends on the number and energetic position of the trap states below the conduction band. Finally, there is the electron–hole pair recombination that occurs within a few ns,8 and the back transfer of electrons to the oxidized dye taking up to milliseconds.9 The high-energy conversion efficiency of the dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells is due to the fast injection and slow electron back-transfer to the oxidized dye.10
The study of electron dynamics in the ultrafast time domain, i.e., femtoseconds, is generally performed with laser-based spectroscopic methods.11 Infrared (IR) spectroscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful tools to monitor electrons in the conduction band of semiconductors.12 Free carriers in the conduction band or shallow traps (sub-bands) within the conduction band of a semiconductor yield a broad mid-IR (region between 1.5 and 15 μm) absorption that increases with the wavelength.13 Therefore, IR absorption can be used as an unequivocal spectroscopic probe of electrons in a semiconductor's conduction band and/or shallow traps without the interference of adsorbates' electronic transitions.5,14 This contrasts with near-IR studies (region between 0.75 and 1.5 μm),15 which were found to be sensitive to a plethora of interferences as the earlier visible studies, namely: the possible spectral overlap of the ground state, excited singlet state, triplet state of the neutral sensitizer, the ground state of the cation, and the absorption of injected electrons.4
Despite the clear advantage of femtosecond laser-based IR spectroscopy in terms of sensitivity and time resolution, the method has a narrow spectral range due to its inherent narrow spectral bandwidth (a few hundreds of cm−1), making it hard to follow charge dynamics unless a band associated with a molecular vibration is present, which is not the case for pristine and/or metal-modified TiO2. Conventional broadband time resolved step-scan FTIR (Fourier transform IR) spectrometry has a time resolution on the order of 100 ns,16 which leaves a significant gap for investigations of processes occurring in the range of 0.1 to 100 ns.
Here, we demonstrate a synchrotron-based IR transient absorption technique with 100 ps time resolution, as given by the synchrotron radiation bunch length, to investigate the electron dynamics in semiconductors triggered by an optical laser pulse.17 The advantages of the synchrotron-based experiments are their large dynamic range and the sensitivity of the system combined with the large spectral bandwidth, which covers the entire mid-IR range (approx. 625 to 10000 cm−1), making it a very attractive technique. The multi-wavelength laser light system uses near-IR laser pulses generated by a Nd:YAG system and parametric down and up-conversion. A Phase-Lock Loop (PLL) control system locks the laser system to the SLS (Swiss Light Source) reference frequency of 500 MHz, as shown in Fig. 1. The delay between the pump (100 ps laser pulse) and probe (synchrotron radiation pulse, the so-called camshaft, which has 4 times the charge of a standard bunch) was electronically tuned by a vector modulator (VM). This allows addition of an arbitrary phase delay, and hence a time delay of up to 1 ms.
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the SLS IR pump–probe setup. Both the pulsed laser at 532 nm and the digital data acquisition are synchronized to the SLS reference frequency of 500 MHz. 
The transmission of the camshaft pulses was measured with a fast Peltier-cooled mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector featuring a bandwidth of 800 MHz. The peak amplitude is digitalized with a 14-bit resolution fast-sampling card, which records both pumped and unpumped transmission (arriving 1 μs in advance) instantaneously. Hence, this detection scheme is not susceptible to instabilities of the synchrotron sources (manifested in the 1 to 3 kHz range) and the slow drift phenomena, and it allows increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of step-scan experiments significantly (typically by a factor of 100) on a timescale relevant to our experiments.
To evaluate the potential of this setup, we measured the conduction band electron dynamics after direct band gap excitation (355 nm) and indirect excitation via ruthenium dye (532 nm), as is schematically represented in Fig. 2. However, it must be pointed out that the proposed technique can be used for other applications, e.g., unveiling short lived surface intermediates of a catalytic transformation. The 100 ps time resolution of the setup does not allow us to detect electron injection but gives insight into what happens to free carriers after they are injected (highlighted by the red arrows in Fig. 2). By monitoring signal decay as a function of time one can estimate the lifetime of a free carrier. The experiments were performed using self-supported thin wafers under N2 flow to avoid the presence of electron scavengers, such as O2 and CO2. Powder samples prepared from TiO2 (4 nm, Sigma-Aldrich) were pressed at 3–4 tons pressure to obtain the self-supporting wafers. The samples were monitored before excitation and for up to 2 ns after excitation. The diameter of the pump spot was twice that of the probe (≈100 μm) spot in order to avoid artefacts caused by spatial beam drift.

The top panel of Fig. 3 shows the obtained absorbance spectrum of the TiO2 sample coated with cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) sensitizing dye (Ru-N719) before light excitation. The spectrum is dominated by three bands, one around 1390 cm−1 associated with the CC stretching of the aromatic rings, another at 1643 cm−1 ascribed to the deprotonated carboxylic groups (COO−)18 and the final one at 2098 cm−1 associated with the C–N stretching of the thiocyanate group.19 The spectral resolution (16 cm−1) and S/N due to the high absorbance of the bands prevent us from monitoring changes in the molecular vibrations of the dye upon laser excitation. In order to reveal changes in the molecular vibrations one needs to improve S/N, which can be achieved by longer data acquisitions or more frequent sample excitation, neither of which are feasible with the current experimental setup.

(Top) Unpumped absorbance spectrum; (bottom) mid-IR signal between 1200 and 2600 cm−1 at different pump–probe time delays: (blue) −100 ps, (red) 0 ps, (green) 300 ps and (black) 1500 ps. The solid lines correspond to the Lorentz fit of trap states offset by 80 meV. 
Excitation at 532 nm leads to a broad band absorption in the mid-IR related to the presence of free carriers in the conduction band (Fig. 3, bottom panel).4 This did not occur in pristine TiO2. The highest absorption was detected at t = 0 ps, which is the time ascribed to the best possible time overlap between the pump and the probe. It must be mentioned that the pump–probe signal at t = −100 ps is due to the residual overlap between the pump and the probe pulses, both with a length of 100 ps. The measured signals corroborate the idea that charge injection is very quick. The spectra recovered gradually as the delay between the pump and the probe was increased. The broad band absorption in the spectra caused by free carriers in the conduction band or shallow traps (sub-bands) were fitted using two models, namely the Drude model,20 commonly used to fit free carriers in the conduction band, and a Lorentz model with an offset of 80 meV, which is used to describe free carriers in shallow traps (eqn (1)): (1)where A is the amplitude, ω is the frequency in cm−1, ω0 is the frequency offset (which is zero for the Drude case) and Γ is a parameter associated with the scattering time in cm−1.
Qualitatively, the best fit was achieved with the Lorentz with an offset of 80 meV, but the accuracy of the fit does not allow a strong claim to be made on this offset as this would require us to extend our analysis of the spectral changes to lower frequencies. Nevertheless 80 meV is consistent with the values reported elsewhere.21 It should be mentioned that the shape of the spectra at lower frequencies could be seen as an indication that the signal comes primarily from shallow traps.22 This is a clear example demonstrating the advantage of using broadband transient IR spectroscopy.
Charge mobility depends on the drift velocity, which is a measure of the average velocity attained by an electron in an electric field. The main factor determining the drift velocity is the scattering time, which is defined as the time taken by an accelerated electron to collide with something that changes its direction and/or energy. In semiconductors, the most important sources of scattering are ionized impurity and acoustic phonons.23 The scattering time (τs) was found to be constant for the times up to 2 ns and about 6 fs. The value was calculated using eqn (2): (2)where c is the speed of light. The short scattering time suggests that our nanoparticles contain a high number of scatterers leading to a lower mobility when compared to bulk materials.24
The transient changes in the mid-IR signal fitted with a Lorentz distribution of trap states offset by 80 meV are plotted in Fig. 4, where we give the amplitude A as described in eqn (1). The data were fitted with a rate equation model which takes into account the 100 ps time structure of the pump and probe pulse and uses 50 fs as the injection time, as described elsewhere.25 The best fitting was achieved with two exponential decays, a short time decay associated with the probe overlap and the other decay with τ = 5.9 ± 1.2 ns associated with shallow trap electron dynamics. The measured lifetime is similar to the 5.6–8 ns lifetime reported by Asbury et al.4 The result attests to the applicability of this setup to determine electron dynamics in the conduction band and/or shallow traps of semiconductors. Despite the qualitative agreement of the decay times, one must be careful when comparing decay times with samples with different dye concentrations. The electron–hole and electron–cation recombination times are bimolecular processes that depend on their concentration. Therefore, direct comparison requires rigorous concentration dependent studies (through excitation power) conducted at relevant timescales,26 which was beyond the scope of this work.

The measured decay cannot be associated with electron back transfer to the oxidized dye since this occurs in the ms range, therefore it must be ascribed to electron relaxation within TiO2 (electron cooling and/or trapping). Electron cooling dynamics occur in less than 1 ps, i.e., undetectable by our setup. Therefore the decay is most likely associated with charge trapping. Electron transport within TiO2 occurs via several trapping–detrapping events across energetically distributed intra-band-gap states (shallow traps) in the conduction band.27 The multitrapping mode of charge transport leads to a decrease of charge mobility with time because the charge is trapped in deeper trap states.8 The other possible explanation is the decrease of the available trap states density,28 however using TiO2 nanoparticles we expect an increase of the density of trap states in comparison to bulk TiO2 due to higher concentration of defect sites.

Fig. 5 shows the mid-IR relative signal change when charge separation is achieved by direct excitation of the band gap. The data were fitted by the same rate equation model with two exponential decays, the first decay attributed to the immediate effects when the pump and the probe overlap exactly. The long decay with τ = 2.5 ± 0.4 ns is credited to the non-radiative recombination of electron–hole pairs within the semiconductor,4 confirming it as the main contributor for the depletion of separated charges within TiO2, i.e., decrease of the reaction quantum yield. The shorter decay time with respect to the one measured with the dye system can be rationalized on the basis that electrons and holes reside in the same semiconductor and therefore are very likely to meet each other and recombine. This relaxation process is not available in the dye-coated TiO2 system, making the lifetime of the excited electron longer, which is one of the reasons behind the high energy conversion efficiency in dye-sensitized TiO2 solar cells.10
 Fig. 5  Time dependence of the mid-IR integrated signal of TiO2 () and 0.8 wt% Au/TiO2 () irradiated at 355 nm with 100 ps pump pulses with an energy of 10 μJ. Integration was performed from 1728–2013 cm−1. The solid lines relate to the fit using the rate equation model. 
To decrease the rate of undesired charge recombination in the bare nanoparticles, Kamat and co-workers added a metal, such as Au or Ag.29 The metal is added to primarily increase photogenerated charges and promote catalytic reactions (co-catalyst). In order to work as an electron sink, the Fermi level of the added metals must be located below the TiO2 conduction band. This leads to a migration of the photo-generated electrons from the semiconductor conduction band to the metal. Fig. 5 shows the difference in the transient mid-IR transmittance when small Au nanoparticles (<3 nm) were added to the surface of TiO2. A decay time of 3.2 ± 1.0 ns was detected, which is slightly longer than the decay time detected with pristine TiO2, suggesting that the addition of gold does not significantly change the conduction band electron dynamics that remain in TiO2. It should be mentioned that due to the low signal the spectra were fitted only between 1728 and 2013 cm−1, and the values reported are the integrated changes in the signal.
The addition of gold nanoparticles decreases the amount of free carriers, which confirms that some of the photo-generated electrons are transferred to gold. The current setup allows us to estimate the amount of charge that is transferred to gold by comparing the values for gold modified and pristine TiO2 at 0 ps (after injection). The changes at 0 ps suggest that 37% of the electrons are transferred from the conduction band of TiO2 to the gold nanoparticles. An alternative explanation is that the Au–TiO2 interface acts as a charge recombination center, however that would not justify the enhancement in catalytic performance when a metal such as Au or Pt is added to the photocatalyst. Gold can absorb UV light, but one expects internal conversion within <2 ps,30 making it impossible to probe with our current experimental setup.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that transient broadband synchrotron-based mid-IR spectroscopy with a time resolution of 100 ps is a valuable tool for understanding the dynamics of free electrons in the conduction band of semi-conductors. The time resolution and broadband spectrum yield unique results and may therefore represent true progress in relation to the current state-of-the-art. We hope this communication will spur other synchrotron facilities to install similar setups. Another advantage of the current setup is the microfocusing capability, which was not exploited but can be used to perform spatially resolved studies. Finally, the setup can also be used to investigate a plethora of chemical transformations in situ using microreactors due to the high signal intensity (no need to concentrate), which will provide insight into reaction mechanisms and help to identify short-lived intermediates.
