Introduction
As a down-conversion process that converts high-energy singlet into double lower-energy triplet excitons, singlet fission (SF) could potentially offset thermalization losses and boost the efficiency of photovoltaic devices.1–5 Such promising application has rekindled research interest on this phenomenon in the last decades.1–3 However, the scope of SF-active materials still remains rather limited due to the specific energetic requirements of E(S1) ≈ 2E(T1), and the complicated modulation of intermolecular interactions.2–4,6,7 Moreover, although SF-based photovoltaic devices with power quantum efficiency (PCE) above 100% have been achieved,8,9 a limited number of chromophores currently meet the requirements of an ideal SF material for practical application, such as high extinction coefficient, suitable triplet energy, ultrafast, efficient SF property, good stability, etc.2–4,6,7 Therefore, there is a high demand for the development of new SF-capable compounds targeted at practical application.
The thienoquinoid (TQ) skeleton is a series of non-polycyclic aromatic small molecules with great applications in optoelectronic devices.10–18 These quinoidal structures feature a distinctive biradical character, which fulfills a basic requirement for the SF process.7,11,19,20 Varnavski et al. reported an intramolecular SF system based on cyanomethylene-terminated TQ compound.21 For the more easily prepared non-cyanomethylene-terminated TQs (Fig. 1),22 however, the detailed SF dynamics has not yet been systematically studied. Zhu et al., Wibowo et al. and Bhattacharyya et al. individually presented theoretical simulations of the SF dynamics in similar frameworks.23–25 Using TQs as electronic donor, Kawata et al. fabricated bilayer photovoltaic devices despite a low PCE value (≤1.1%), and claimed that SF process functioned in these devices, as verified by theoretical calculations and the magnetic field response of the photocurrent.26 These results indicated that such quinoidal skeleton might be a potential SF candidate, but its excited-state dynamics remain unexplored and elusive. Recently, our group addressed a molecular design strategy for practical SF materials based on donor/acceptor-decorated quinoidal structures.7 TQ molecule turned out to be a potential candidate based on this design strategy, exhibiting a strong absorption ability, suitable energy levels, and excellent chemical stability.3,7,26 In the current work, we have systematically investigated the SF dynamics of the TQ system, combining transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy with multi-reference electronic structure calculations (CASPT2/CASSCF). Conformational distortion-harnessed SF dynamics were clearly observed in the studied system, which features the rapid generation and subsequent annihilation of intramolecular multiexciton (ME) dark state with 21A symmetry. Although increased lifetimes have been achieved via partially constrained conformational distortion in solid or aggregate states, these SF-populated ME species cannot undergo effective decoupling and dissociate completely into individual triplet excitons instead, recovering to ground state via the triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) channel. These outcomes present an intuitive understanding of SF dynamics of the TQ skeleton, which could provide some guidance for the design and practical application of new SF materials.

TQ-doped polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) films (weight ratio of 5%) were prepared by spin-coating method on sapphire substrate at 3000 r.p.m. for 1 min in a nitrogen-filled glove box.27 Neat films were prepared by vapor deposition method on a sapphire substrate at a rate of 0.3 Å s−1 under a vacuum of 1 × 10−5 mbar.

Spectroscopic measurement and analysis
UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer and Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer, respectively. All the spectra were measured at room temperature unless stated otherwise. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) and nanosecond transient absorption (ns-TA) spectroscopy measurements were all performed using previously described instruments and experimental conditions.28–30
Theoretical calculations
All geometry optimizations are calculated with state-averaged CASSCF (SA-CASSCF), and all reported energies are evaluated by CASPT2.31,32 CASPT2//CASSCF is one of the few electronic structure methods capable of treating singlet fission because it involves clear double-excitation problems. In all the CASPT2//CASSCF calculations, an active space of 12 electrons in 12 orbitals is used to obtain accurate results.
Results and discussion
Steady-state properties
The studied TQ molecules were synthesized using the previously reported methods with some minor modifications.26 The molecules do not show any obvious degradation from exposure to air and moisture in both solution and powder states, indicating excellent stability. UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of TQ molecules were recorded in CH2Cl2, doped PMMA film and neat film (Fig. 1). In dilute solution, the spectrum presents the maxima at 535 nm, ascribed to optically allowed S0 → S1 transition. The molar extinction coefficient is at the level of 8 × 104 M−1 cm−1, which is a key parameter for a practical SF material.3,7 The doped PMMA film shows a similar absorption line shape with that of solution, and the maxima is slightly blue-shifted to 530 nm. In neat film, the spectrum displays obvious red shift, and a new peak appears around 570 nm, indicating strong intermolecular interaction in a J-type solid aggregate. Significantly, TQ molecules exhibit very low PL efficiency (ΦF < 0.1%) in solution, PMMA film, and neat film (Fig. 1), implying there are other, more efficient nonradiative pathways for excited state deactivation.33–35
Capture of multiexciton dark state
In order to investigate the SF dynamics of the TQ system, state-averaged CASSCF(12,12) and CASPT2(12,12) calculations were carried out firstly to visualize the excited-state energy diagrams with OpenMolcas (Fig. 2, 3 and Table 1).36 On the basis of the optimized ground state (S0, 11A) structure, we explored the electronic structures of the relevant excited states, i.e., 11A, 21A, 11B, and 13B state (Fig. 2, for details see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). The symmetry-allowed H → L singly excited transition leads to the optically bright S1 (11B) state. A dark state (21A) with double excitation properties was found about 0.4 eV above the S1 bright state at the Franck–Condon point (Fig. 3a). In this dark state, double excitation involves simultaneous promotion of two electrons from occupied to unoccupied orbitals, specifically H → L transition with electronic configuration of (222220200000), which indicates its ME character (Table 1 and Table S1, ESI†). Then, canonical molecular orbitals (CMOs) are linearly transformed into the localized molecular orbitals (LMOs) to demonstrate the ME character of this state (Fig. 3b, for details see Fig. S3 and S4 in the ESI†).37 Subsequent configuration interaction calculations show that the main configuration (2222udud0000) has one electron in each localized orbital, which finally produces four unpaired electrons occupying the spatially localized orbitals. Therefore, this dark state can be described as two electron−hole pairs located on opposite ends of the TQ skeleton, which turns out to be a triplet pair (TT) coupled into an overall singlet ME state. The S1 (11B), TT (21A), and T1 (13B) state minima are predicted to be 1.98, 1.90 and 0.80 eV, respectively. The energy ordering of the S1 (11B) and TT (21A) states is inverted when the molecule evolves from the Franck–Condon region to 21A minimum. A crossing point between the two electronic states can be seen intuitively from the linearly interpolated internal coordinate (LIIC) pathway from the S1 (11B) to ME (21A) state (Fig. 3c). Given the quasi-degeneracy energies and intersection of the two electronic states, the conversion process of S1 (11B) → TT (21A) is generally accepted to occur on a timescale of sub-picosecond or shorter, and outperforms other radiative and nonradiative processes, which is further evidenced by experimental results discussed below. Moreover, from the optimized structures, conformational changes were clearly observed in the studied excited states (Fig. 2). Relative to the nearly coplanar structure of the ground state, those of S1 (11B), TT (21A), and T1 (13B) states show gradually increased dihedral angles between the TQ core and two lateral fluorene units as 23.4/23.7, 40.7/41.0, and 38.2/60.3 degrees, respectively. These results indicate that conformational distortion-harnessed photophysical processes are highly likely to play some role in the rapid excited state deactivation, resulting in fluorescence quenching in the TQ skeleton.

SF dynamics in monomer states
To present the full picture of SF dynamics for the studied TQ system, we perform TA measurements in dilute solution, PMMA film, and neat film (Fig. 4 and 5). Firstly, the pump pulse at 470 nm excites the TQ molecule in DCM solution to elucidate the unimolecular excited-state dynamics. After photoexcitation, the fs-TA spectra (Fig. 4a and b) consist of clear ground state bleaching (GSB) at ∼530 nm, stimulated emission (SE) at ∼590 nm, and intense excited-state absorption (ESA) band at ∼770 nm assigned to the initially populated bright S1 (11B) state. This ESA from S1 rises within the instrument response function and decays rapidly in <10 ps. Concurrent with the decay of S1-ESA, new absorption bands appear around ∼560 nm, and then persist to ∼100 ps. Global analysis based on a three-state stepwise model is the simplest and best describes the solution data (Fig. 5a and b). Given the ultrafast conversion process, within sub-picosecond, we assigned the initial and intermediate species to hot and relaxed S1 states (S1* and S1), respectively. The spectral signatures of the end species are comparable to the sensitized triplet curve, indicating a triplet-like excited state (Fig. 5a inset for details on triplet sensitization see Fig. S5, ESI†). Combining the spectral pattern and population timescale, we tentatively assigned the intramolecular tightly coupled TT state, as described in the theoretical calculation results. That is, after photoexcitation, the initially populated hot S1* exciton relaxes to a cooled S1 exciton at an ultrafast rate of (0.2 ps)−1. Then, the relaxed S1 exciton could undergo rapid SF process with conformational change and transform into intramolecular TT state with a time constant of 3.6 ps, given the quasi-degeneracy energies and intersection of the two electronic states. Finally, the SF-formed TT state recovers to ground state with a short lifetime of 13.4 ps. We attributed this rapid deactivation of TT state to the strong coupling interaction of inter-triplets located on opposite ends of the confined TQ skeleton, which are difficult to decouple and dissociate into free triplets and, instead, peculiarly prone to recover to ground state via TTA channel.5,19,29,35,38

The time constant for TT state in f was not accurately determined since it was beyond the 5 ns detection time window of our fs-TA apparatus. Insets: Triplet-like species assignments via comparison of fs-TA transient species and sensitized triplet signatures in dilute solution and thin film. 
To investigate the potential influence of conformational changes on SF dynamics, we performed TA measurements in the TQ-doped PMMA film, where the conformational changes are probably constrained by the surrounding polymer matrix to some degree (Fig. 4c and d). TA spectra show very similar spectral line shapes and evolution of photophysical processes to those from dilute solution (Fig. 4c). However, decay kinetic curves shown in Fig. 4d exhibit the relatively slower spectral evolution of excited-state species. Then, global analysis based on a three-state model was performed, taking the reverse process of SF (TT → S1) into account (Fig. 5c and d). The fitting results give the time constants of 0.2, 9.7, 306 and 207 ps, respectively (Fig. 5d). That is, in doped solid PMMA film, the partial conformational constraint slows down the SF process, but remarkably restrains the rapid annihilation of SF-populated intramolecular TT state. Long exciton lifetime is extremely important to practical application in photovoltaic devices.2,3 These outcomes clearly confirm that a distinctive conformational distortion-harnessed SF dynamic dominates the excited-state deactivation of the studied TQ system.
SF dynamics in aggregate state
To further track the SF dynamics and explore possibilities of TT dissociation, we perform TA measurements in aggregate state and neat films (Fig. 4e and f). Compared to spectra from the monomer state, there are three major changes resulting from exciton delocalization in aggregate state: (i) GSB signals are red-shifted to ∼600 nm; (ii) broadening ESA peaks overlap seriously with GSB signals; (iii) there are long-lived signals persistent beyond the fs-TA detection window. After photoexcitation, the strong ESA band in the range of 600–900 nm appears, along with GSB signal peaks at 535 and 605 nm. Then the ESA band decays, and the GSB signal peak at 605 nm first remains unchanged within 1 ps, then recovers in less than 25 ps, while the peak at 535 nm remains unchanged during this period of the timescale (Fig. 4f). In other words, concurrent with decay of the ESA band, a new ESA band forms around ∼600 nm and leads to the recovery of GSB signal magnitude at 605 nm, while the overall GSB signals do not recover obviously. This evolution shows great similarity with those in solution or PMMA film, which suggests there are similar photophysical processes. At the longer time delay of hundreds of picoseconds, the ESA band fades away, and GSB signals also further recover toward the baseline but feature the same line shapes beyond the fs-TA detection window, suggesting that only one end species exists. Then, global analysis was performed using a four-state model (Fig. 5e and f) providing four transient species with the time constants of 0.2, 9.8, 410, 195 ps, and 12 ns, respectively. Considering the similar spectral evolution and the corresponding rate constants with those in monomer state, we assigned the first and second transient species to the hot S1* and relaxed S1 state, respectively. To investigate the nature of the two remaining long-lived species, triplet sensitization experiments and long time-delay TA measurements were then performed. Results show that the TA signals of the two remaining transient species display similar but not identical absorption characteristics, with the sensitized triplet line shapes indicating a triplet-like species (Fig. 5e inset and Fig. S7, ESI†). However, we do not detect a clear long-lived signal at the microsecond timescale, which indicates that these triplet-like species decaying within the nanosecond timescale cannot be free triplet excitons resulting from decoupling dissociation of TT state. Therefore, we assigned the third species to the hot TT* state given its lifetime and the residual singlet ESA character around NIR region, and the end species to the cooled TT state. However, it should be noted that such end species features exclusive GSB signatures around 500–600 nm, but spectral line shapes are not identical with the negative of steady-state absorption. Then, we rule out the heat effect in TA data from neat film measurements based on control experiments (Fig. S8, ESI†) and attribute this to the presence of serious spectral overlap of triplet ESA and GSB signals. We also exclude the possibilities of charge transfer or charge separation species, given the absence of characteristic absorption signatures of these species, usually in NIR spectral region. Moreover, intermolecular SF process is another possible pathway for the population of triplet-like species, as theoretically simulated by Zhu et al. and Wibowo et al.23,25 Given the quasi-degeneracy energies and intersection of the two electronic states, the conversion of S1 (11B) → TT (21A) process is generally accepted to undergo on a timescale of sub-picosecond or shorter and outperforms other radiative and nonradiative processes. Moreover, the similar spectral evolution in TA measurements from dilute solution, PMMA film, and neat film also elucidates the similar excited-state dynamic processes in monomer and aggregate states. Along with the absence of triplet dissociation in aggregate state, we thus also rule out the possibility of intermolecular SF process. In brief, the increased lifetimes could be achieved via partially constrained conformational distortion or exciton delocalization in solid or aggregate states, yet these SF-populated ME species cannot undergo effective decoupling and dissociate completely into individual triplet excitons instead, recovering to ground state via TTA channel. We attributed this to the strong coupling interaction and binding energy of inter-triplet located on the opposite ends of the confined TQ skeleton.5,38 The elongation of molecular skeleton and the introduction of charge transfer character might afford a less tightly bound ME state, then make the decoupling dissociation of intramolecular TT state feasible in solid aggregates.5,38
Conformational distortion-harnessed SF dynamics
In order to obtain more evidence for the conformational distortion-harnessed SF dynamics, temperature-dependent fluorescence measurements were performed (Fig. 6). Results show that as the measurement temperature decreases, the neat film exhibits obviously enhanced and blue shifted fluorescence emission behaviors. The emission signal at 77 K was almost one order of magnitude greater than that at room temperature. We supposed that the low temperature constrained the molecular conformational changes and slowed down the singlet-to-triplet conversion process, resulting in the increased chance of radiative transition. Despite this, the still-weak and short-lived fluorescence emission excludes the accurate characterization of its lifetime. Moreover, the results from fs-TA data for dilute solution and PMMA film clearly proved the conformational distortion-harnessed SF process in TQ skeleton (Fig. 4a–d and 5a–d). Compared to the SF dynamics in dilute solution, TQ molecules in PMMA film showed the slightly slower processes of S1-to-ME state and ME deactivation, which were attributed to the partial conformational constraint in solid PMMA film. Furthermore, the excitation-energy-dependent fs-TA measurements for neat films might provide some hints for the conformational distortion (Fig. S6, ESI†). The results show that as excitation energies increase from 10 to 100 nJ, the singlet decay kinetic at 810 nm wavelength exhibits obviously accelerated decay trends. Except for the possible singlet–singlet annihilation process resulting from the higher excitation energies, the slightly enhanced SF process via temperature-increased conformational changes at the excitation hot site might also be partly responsible for this phenomenon. These experimental and theoretical results clearly depict a distinctive conformational distortion-harnessed SF process featuring rapid generation and subsequent annihilation of intramolecular ME dark state (Scheme 1). Photoinduced hot S1* (11B) relaxes to the cooled S1 (11B) exciton within a sub-picosecond timescale (0.2 ps). Then, the S1 (11B) exciton could undergo rapid SF process to generate ME dark state, i.e., TT (21A) state. After that, SF-populated TT state will recover to ground state via TTA channel. These photophysical processes turn out to be conformational distortion harnessed. The increased lifetimes could be achieved via the partially constrained conformational distortion or exciton delocalization in solid or aggregate states, yet these SF-populated ME species cannot undergo effective decoupling and dissociate into completely individual triplet excitons.

The current TQ molecule exhibits similar photophysical properties, especially excited state electronic structures, with the previous QOTn series, given their similar chemical structures. However, we do not observe the disputable long-lived triplet signals with lifetime of about tens of microseconds as well as the delayed fluorescence reported in the previous QOTn series.21 Moreover, solid aggregate studies are very important for implementing the practical application of potential SF materials. The current study focuses more on the SF dynamics of TQ skeleton in aggregate states and presents the conformational distortion-harnessed SF dynamics, featuring rapid generation and subsequent annihilation of intramolecular multiexciton (ME) dark state. The increased lifetimes, over several orders of magnitude, could be achieved via the partially constrained conformational distortion and exciton delocalization in solid or aggregate states, which are important for practical application. Based on these findings, we consider that the low efficiency in the SF-based photovoltaic device presented by Kawata et al. might be largely due to unsuitable donor–acceptor bilayer device structure.26 A bulk-heterojunction device structure might be better suited to extract the doubled triplets from intramolecular SF contribution.
Conclusions
In summary, we have systematically studied the SF dynamics of TQ skeleton, combining transient spectroscopy measurements and theoretical simulations. Results present a distinctive conformational distortion-harnessed SF process featuring the rapid generation and subsequent annihilation of intramolecular ME dark state with 21A symmetry. The increased lifetimes could be achieved via partially constrained conformational distortion and exciton delocalization in solid or aggregate states, yet these SF-populated TT species cannot undergo effective decoupling and dissociate completely into individual triplet excitons instead, recovering to ground state via TTA channel. Such findings not only present a deeper understanding of SF dynamics and triplet formation mechanisms in the thienoquinoidal compound but also indicate that the restricting factor for the low efficiency in previously reported SF-based organic solar cells might be the unsuitable bilayer device structure, which could be conducive to the implementation of practical application of these SF materials and the next generation of SF-based photovoltaic devices.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Chemical structure and steady-state absorption and PL spectra of TQ molecules in dilute CH2Cl2 solution (10−5 M, black lines), PMMA film (5% doping ratio, red lines), and the neat film (50 nm, blue lines).	 

 	Fig. 2  CASSCF(12,12)/ANO-RCC-VDZP optimized ground-state and excited-state minimum-energy structures; also shown are selected bond distortions.	 

 	Fig. 3  Excited-state energy diagram and ME state characteristics. (a) Energy diagram of involved excited states. (b) Canonical (left) and localized (right) molecular orbitals (CMOs and LMOs). (c) LIIC path connecting the 11B and 21A minima.

 	Fig. 4  SF dynamics of TQ molecules. Selected spectral slices and corresponding kinetic decay for TA measurements in (a and b) dilute DCM solution, (c and d) PMMA film, and (e and f) neat film (470 nm excitation).	 

 	Fig. 5  Global analysis results based on three-/four-state kinetic model. Species-associated spectra and kinetic model with the corresponding time constant parameters from TA data for (a and b) dilute DCM solution, (c and d) PMMA film and (e and f) neat film. The time constant for TT state in f was not accurately determined since it was beyond the 5 ns detection time window of our fs-TA apparatus. Insets: Triplet-like species assignments via comparison of fs-TA transient species and sensitized triplet signatures in dilute solution and thin film.	 

 	Fig. 6  Temperature-dependent fluorescence spectra of TQ neat film (300, 200, 100, and 77 K). Inset: Corresponding normalized fluorescence emission signals.	 

 	Scheme 1  Conformational distortion-harnessed SF dynamics in TQ skeleton.
