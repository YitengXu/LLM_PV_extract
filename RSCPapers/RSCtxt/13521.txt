    , Accepted 3rd June 2021First published on 7th June 2021AbstractThe defects including halide vacancies and uncoordinated Pb in perovskite films caused by the cracking of Pb–I bonds in the thermal annealing process are responsible for the degradation of the photovoltaic performance and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Passivation of halide vacancies and uncoordinated Pb defects and construction of high quality perovskite films are vital to promote carrier lifetime and reduce non-radiative recombination losses. Herein, we develop a facile and broadly applicable surface passivation strategy for various compositional perovskite films, in which cadmium bromide (CdBr2) is selected and adopted to passivate the halide vacancies and uncoordinated Pb defects of the perovskite films owing to the stronger bond energies of Cd–I and Pb–Br than that of Pb–I. CdBr2 modification is found to be able to prolong carrier lifetime and decrease defect amount together with improving film quality of the typical compositional perovskites i.e. MAPbI3, Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 and CsPbI2Br, as evidenced by spectral and photoelectrochemical measurements. As a result, the photovoltaic performance and ambient, photo and thermal stability of perovskite devices are greatly promoted, with a high efficiency of 16.05% achieved by the CdBr2-modified PSCs with the architecture of ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/carbon, exceeding the previous highest PCE record for carbon-based MAPbI3 PSCs.
Introduction
Over the past decade, laboratory-scale perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a record-breaking power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5%.1,2 Apart from the efficiency superiority, the PSCs can be prepared via a facile solution process and exhibit great potential for scalable production in comparison with other kinds of solar cells, such as Si, CdTe, CuInxGa(1−x)Se2 (CIGS), and Cu2ZnSnS2 (CZTS).3–6 Moreover, the solution preparation enables additive-assisted techniques,7–9 crystal engineering,10–15 interface engineering,16–22etc., to be easily employed to improve the perovskite crystallinity and morphology, the energy level matching of the functional layers, and the charge transfer in the interface of the cell, consequently leading to the continuous improvement of photovoltaic performance and stability. Note that in the state-of-the-art PSCs possessing a PCE exceeding 20% perovskites with high ratios of iodine are mainly adopted to obtain a relatively low bandgap for sufficient sunlight harvest.23–25
Generally, the solution process for preparing perovskites involves rapid nucleation and thermal treatment for crystal growth, in which various kinds of defects inevitably form depending on perovskite precursor composition and processing conditions. Taking methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) as an example, vacancies from Pb2+ (VPb) and MA+ (VMA) as well as iodine vacancies (VI) are the detrimental defects in bulk MAPbI3, impairing charge extraction from the perovskite absorber layer with aggravated surface carrier recombination and decreased PCE.26 Among these, VI widely exist in other organic–inorganic perovskite films particularly in the case of high ratios of iodine, which is widely reported as a predominant trap source on surfaces causing non-radiative recombination losses owing to the existing electron–hole recombination centers and/or the formation of hole traps. Furthermore, the vacancy defects also provide a channel for ion migration, which brings about the fast degradation of devices under various operational conditions.27–29 Thus, it is essential to remove non-radiative recombination pathways caused by VI and meanwhile improve the quality of perovskite films. Various strategies have been explored to fabricate high-efficiency PSCs with fewer defects, of which surface defect passivation is considered as one of the most effective means to decrease the defect quantity owing to its simple manipulation process.30–33
The incorporation of Cd2+ ions into the perovskite lattice has the ability to reduce VI by the formation of stronger Cd–I ionic bonds and improve perovskite film grain growth.34,36–38 The work reported by Saidaminov et al. showed that incorporating Cd2+ into the perovskite lattice, which is isovalent to Pb2+ but has a smaller ionic radius, could increase the stability and the formation energy of vacancies via strain relaxation.34 Subsequently, Huang and his co-workers adopted a small amount CdI2 to post-treat the surface of perovskite films, and found that excess iodide ions can fill the surface VI and simultaneously Cd is capable of immobilizing the escaping iodine ions by forming stronger Cd–I ionic bonds instead of Pb–I bonds owing to the stronger electronegativity of Cd.35 Besides, Zhao et al. applied DFT calculations to confirm that the substitution energy of Cd to Pb is −1.16 eV, showing that Cd2+ ions can easily enter the perovskite lattice and partially substitute Pb2+ ions.36
Another commonly-used solution is to fill the VI with excess halides, thereby reducing the number of VI in the perovskite films. According to a previous report, VI may exist in the form of a shallow donor (positively charged) or a deep acceptor (negatively charged). Note that two neighboring Pb atoms tend to the negatively charged VI site to form a Pb–Pb bond, hence resulting in lattice distortion and a short carrier lifetime. Yin et al. performed a theoretic study and put forward a possible targeted strategy to passivate VI by using Br owing to the smaller radius of Br− (1.96 Å) than that of I− (2.20 Å) as well as the stronger Pb–Br bond than the Pb–I bond owing to the stronger electronegativity of Br.39,40 They considered that a stronger driving force in the Br-modified perovskite film facilitates breaking of the Pb–Pb dimer, and as a result the carrier lifetime prolongs significantly from 3.2 ns to 19 ns. Taking the above mentioned experimental evidence and theoretical calculation into consideration, we can infer that CdBr2 is more effective in reducing the defects caused by VI in perovskite films. However, it is yet to be reported.
Herein, we report a universally applicable strategy to decrease the defects caused by VI in various compositional perovskite films by a simple post-treatment with CdBr2, in which Cd is capable of inhibiting the formation of VI and Br has the capability of filling VI and breaking the Pb–Pb dimer. By applying CdBr2/isopropanol (IPA) to modify three compositional perovskite films, i.e. MAPbI3, CsFAPbI3 and CsPbI2Br, we obtain high-quality perovskite films with characteristics of low defect density, long carrier lifetime and larger grain sizes. The CdBr2 surface modification strategy effectively promotes the device performance in terms of efficiency and stability. The resultant CdBr2-modified MAPbI3 carbon-based PSCs (C-PSCs) show a remarkably enhanced efficiency from 13.03% to 16.05% and a reduced hysteresis as well as improved fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (VOC). This approach significantly enhances the stability of perovskite films and devices under ambient atmosphere (30–50% relative humidity), continuous illumination and high temperature (80 °C) under dark conditions in N2.
Results and discussion
VI forming recombination centers are typical point defects existing on the surface of perovskite films. Regarding MAPbI3, it contains a large amount of fragile Pb–I bonds which are prone to break, and it thus exhibits more VI.41,42 Therefore, MAPbI3 fabricated by a two-step spin-coating method is chosen as the representative perovskite for this study. The CdBr2-treated MAPbI3 perovskite film was fabricated by spin-coating a CdBr2/IPA solution on the top of perovskite films, followed by thermal annealing to remove the solvent. The probable working mechanism of CdBr2 filling up the VI and inhibiting I− migration is illustrated in Fig. 1a. First, introduction of excess Br− can supply more halide ions to fill up the VI. Note that due to the stronger electronegativity of Br, the chemical bonding energy of Pb–Br is larger than that of Pb–I and the newly formed Pb–Br bond is stronger. Apart from that, Cd2+ has an ionic radius of 0.95 Å which is smaller than that of Pb2+ (1.19 Å).43 When a very small amount of CdBr2 is introduced by surface treatment, the Cd2+ will substitute the Pb2+ in the crystal lattice, forming a stable perovskite structure, in which the halide ion migration is effectively inhibited owing to the formation of stronger Cd–I ionic bonds. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out to investigate the effect of CdBr2 modification on the binding energy of Pb2+ and surface composition. As shown in Fig. 1b, the peaks at 138.1 eV and 143.0 eV attributed to Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 in the control perovskite film show a slight shift toward lower binding energy after the post-treatment with CdBr2. Such a negative shift of the Pb 4f signal illustrates that the number of uncoordinated Pb2+ ions within the perovskite decreases, which is most likely due to the introduction of Br− which combines with Pb2+ to form a Pb–Br bond.44 A similar negative shift phenomenon can also be observed in the binding energy of I 3d (Fig. S1a†). Apart from that, the Cd 3d spectrum is shown in Fig. S1b.† It can be observed that the peaks of Cd 3d and Pb 4d are completely overlapped but asymmetrical, suggesting that they are formed by several contributions.45 Compared to pure CdBr2, both the Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 peaks of the CdBr2-treated perovskite film shift to lower binding energy. This phenomenon indicates that Cd2+ ions have formed ionic bonds successfully. Note that the theoretical I/Pb stoichiometric value of a perfect control perovskite film is close to 3. However, the actual I/Pb ratio of the control perovskite film detected from the XPS measurement is only 2.56 (Fig. 1c and Table S1†), indicating the existence of iodide loss during the thermal annealing process. After CdBr2 treatment, the average X/Pb ratio (X refers to halide ions) increases up to 2.81, indicating that Br− ions fill the iodide loss on the surface. Another possibility is that Cd2+ ions immobilize the I− escaping during thermal annealing by forming Cd–I bonds, thereby increasing the atomic ratio and improving the ability of carrier transfer.35 Besides, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping confirms the even distribution of CdBr2 (Fig. S2†).

The XPS results have demonstrated that CdBr2 treatment is able to effectively decrease halide loss and uncoordinated Pb2+, and then steady-state photoluminescence (SSPL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) studies were conducted to verify the carrier recombination dynamics due to the passivation effect of CdBr2 treatment (Fig. 1d, e and S3†). The CdBr2-treated perovskite film exhibits a much higher PL intensity than the control one (Fig. 1d), illustrating that the trap-dominated non-radiative recombination on the perovskite surface and grain boundaries is suppressed after treating with CdBr2. TRPL spectra are shown in Fig. 1e. The values are fitted with a bi-exponential decay function, whose equation is , where τ1 and τ2 denote the decay component which is closely related to non-radiative recombination of defects and a component of bulk recombination, respectively.46 Under the circumstance, TRPL decay mainly refers to the trapping and non-radiative recombination behaviors, and the fitting parameters are listed in Table S2.† The control perovskite film possessed a short average lifetime (120.46 ns), while the target perovskite film shows a much longer lifetime (209.22 ns for the 0.1 mg mL−1 CdBr2-treated one). This demonstrates that the defect state decreases and the non-radiative recombination behavior is suppressed, which is attributable to the reduction of the surface halide loss. Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement derived from electron-only devices with the architecture of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag was carried out to quantify the defect density, as shown in Fig. 1f. The electron trap density (Nt) is calculated based on the equation Nt = (2εε0VTFL)/(eL2), where ε0, ε, e and L denote the vacuum permittivity, dielectric constant, electron charge and the thickness of the perovskite film, respectively. The value of Nt is calculated according to the above equation to be 0.81 × 1016 cm−3 for the CdBr2-treated perovskite film, which is much smaller than that of the control one (1.68 × 1016 cm−3). This quantitative result of reduced trap density provides solid evidence to prove the passivation effect of CdBr2 on surface defects. In most organic semiconductors, trap-assisted recombination is of a non-radiative nature which denotes Shockley–Read–Hall recombination.47 From TRPL measurement results, it can be inferred that trap-assisted recombination is non-radiative, which indicates that trap states have an influence on the recombination mechanism. In order to further confirm that the recombination mechanism in the perovskite film is trap-assisted recombination, the light intensity (P)-dependent VOC and JSC are investigated. The relationship between JSC and P can be expressed by J ∝ Pα (Fig. S4†), where the exponential factor α refers to the extent of bimolecular recombination, that is, radiative recombination. When the slopes are basically equal to 1, it can be inferred that bimolecular recombination in the devices can be ignored.48 The relationship between light intensity and VOC is also plotted. The slope deviating from kT/q represents trap-assisted recombination, where k, T and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature and the electric charge, respectively. It is common knowledge that the slope is normally equal to 1 so that trap-assisted recombination is absent. As presented in Fig. 1g, the slope of the control sample is 1.46 kT/q, indicating an obvious energy loss due to the existence of trap-assisted recombination. However, for the CdBr2-treated perovskite sample, it decreased to 1.19 kT/q, indicating that the trap-assisted recombination has been largely suppressed.49 Results of TRPL and SCLC measurements match with the above results.
The optical and electronic properties of perovskite films with or without CdBr2-treatment were further investigated by performing ultraviolet photoelectron emission (UPS) measurements. The work function (WF) can be determined from the secondary electron cutoff (SECO) region in Fig. 2a, showing a slight decrease from 4.75 to 4.68 eV with the CdBr2 treatment. The altering WF would produce an ionization energy (IE) of 5.63 eV compared with the 5.78 eV for the control perovskite film. In addition, in the valence band maximum region referred to the Fermi level (EF), we also witness a similar slight shift toward higher binding energy, as shown in Fig. 2b. From the UV-vis spectra (Fig. 2c), it can be found that the CdBr2 modification causes a little enlargement in the bandgap of MAPbI3. Accordingly, the bandgap can be calculated on the basis of the Kubelka–Munk equation (Fig. S5†).50 The bandgap of the CdBr2-modified perovskite is estimated as 1.57 eV, which is slightly larger than that of the control film (1.55 eV). Note that, a slight blue shift is also observed in SSPL measurement. Given that the Fermi levels of carbon and SnO2 are around 5.0 eV and 4.05 eV,51 the energy barrier of the perovskite/carbon interface decreases from 0.78 to 0.63 eV after CdBr2 treatment (Fig. 2d), which facilitates blocking of undesired electron transfer from the perovskite layer to the carbon electrode and simultaneously enhancing the hole transfer within this interface.

The inhibition of carrier recombination in CdBr2-treated films could cause efficient charge separation and photo-to-electric conversion performance of devices, and the devices were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3(CdBr2-treated)/carbon as illustrated in Fig. 3a. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the control device and devices treated with various concentrations of CdBr2 are shown in Fig. 3b and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The control device exhibits a PCE of 13.03% with a VOC of 1.00 V, a JSC of 21.08 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61.82%. Obviously, post-treatment with a small dose of CdBr2 induces the PCE enhancement of cells. Among the three devices involved, the 0.1 mg mL−1 CdBr2-treated device achieves a champion PCE of 16.05% with a VOC of 1.06 V, a JSC of 22.92 mA cm−2 and a FF of 66.08%. A statistical analysis of the photovoltaic parameters of 40 devices with and without CdBr2 treatment demonstrates a good reproducibility of CdBr2-treated PSCs (Fig. 3c and S6†). Moreover, the J–V curves in both the forward and reverse scans show that the CdBr2-passivation also effectively reduces the hysteresis of cells from 14.2% to 5.2% (Fig. 3d and Table S3†). The integrated JSC values from external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement for the control and CdBr2-treated devices are 20.95 and 22.88 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 3e), which are consistent with those measured from J–V curves. The improved JSC values as well as the improved VOC and FF originate from the suppression of charge recombination after treating with CdBr2, as discussed above. The stable output curves of JSC and PCE of PSCs with 0.1 mg mL−1 CdBr2 treatment under the maximum power conditions are tested by holding the maximum power point (Vmax = 0.83 V) under light soaking in air as presented in Fig. 3f, from which we can acquire a higher JSC of ca. 19.02 mA cm−2 and a PCE of ca. 15.78% for the CdBr2-modified one. Moreover, the increased recombination resistance (Rrec) for the CdBr2-modified devices in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements under dark conditions further indicates the suppression of carrier recombination in the device upon CdBr2 modification (Fig. S7†), as witnessed by the increment of JSC and FF.

As mentioned before, Br, owing to its stronger electronegativity than I, may have a better ability to decrease the amount of uncoordinated Pb2+ and consequently suppress carrier recombination. To verify this conjecture, CdI2 is also used to modify the MAPbI3 perovskite film for comparison. To this end, we also optimize the CdI2 dose to treat the MAPbI3 perovskite film and show that 0.2 mg mL−1 CdI2 results in the optimal photovoltaic performance, with a VOC of 1.04 V, JSC of 22.24 mA cm−2, FF of 64.35%, and hence a corresponding PCE of 14.88% (Fig. S8 and Table S4†). This value is larger than that of pristine PSCs, but still lower than that of CdBr2-treated MAPbI3 PSCs (champion PCE = 16.05%). Moreover, PL and TRPL measurements also give positive evidence to support the better photovoltaic performance of the CdBr2-based cells (Fig. S9†). It is obvious that compared with CdI2, CdBr2 treatment endows the MAPbI3 film with fewer defects and a longer carrier lifetime, owing to the stronger electronegativity of Br.35
The above-mentioned experiments and results have demonstrated that CdBr2 surface treatment is able to reduce halide vacancies, suppress carrier recombination and improve hole transfer efficiency. To verify its universal effectiveness in reducing halide vacancies, two more kinds of PSCs with various compositions of perovskite films (CsFAPbI3 and CsPbI2Br) have been fabricated with the architecture of ITO/SnO2/Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag and ITO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br/carbon. And the related SCLC, PL, TRPL measurements and J–V curves are provided in Fig. 4, S10 and Table S5.† According to the VTFL values extracted from the dark J–V curves shown in Fig. 4a and b we can obtain the electron trap density, and the values of the Nt of CsFAPbI3, CsFAPbI3–CdBr2, CsPbI2Br, and CsPbI2Br–CdBr2 devices are estimated to be 4.99 × 1015, 4.27 × 1015, 8.66 × 1015 and 6.01 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. In addition, the lower trap density can prolong the carrier lifetime, which can be estimated by TRPL. As presented in Fig. 4c, d and Table S5,† these two CdBr2-based perovskites exhibit longer average lifetimes, ca. 35.68 ns for CsFAPbI3–CdBr2 and ca. 60.80 ns for CsPbI2Br–CdBr2, than control films, ca. 26.96 ns for CsFAPbI3 and ca. 39.10 ns for CsPbI2Br-based films, respectively. The positive effect on prolonging the carrier lifetime regardless of perovskite composition illustrates that CdBr2 post-treatment is a universal strategy capable of reducing defect states and suppressing the non-radiative recombination behavior arising from VI. Moreover, the strengthened PL intensity shown in Fig. S10† also indicates that CdBr2 has the capability of passivating the defects through coordination with the perovskite film effectively. As a consequence, there is an obvious enhancement in the photovoltaic performance as shown in Fig. 4e and f. The PCE of the CsFAPbI3 cell increases from 16.13% (control) to 19.05% (target) upon CdBr2 post-treatment (Fig. 4e). Similarly, the CsPbI2Br target carbon-based cell achieved a champion PCE of 12.29%, higher than the 10.45% of the control device (Fig. 4f). On the basis of the above improved photovoltaic performance along with decreased trap density, it can be inferred that CdBr2 has a common ability to decrease halide vacancies and uncoordinated Pb2+ and passivate the defects in different kinds of perovskite films.

The universal ability of CdBr2 to passivate defects on several typical composition perovskite films has been proved to reduce the charge recombination and promote the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, and the further study on how the CdBr2 exerts its effect is performed. The morphologies of the three kinds of perovskite films with and without CdBr2-treatment were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as shown in Fig. 5a–c. Obviously, CdBr2 post-treatment induces further perovskite grain growth, and the grain sizes are enlarged. The grain size distributions obtained from the three kinds of films without or with CdBr2-treatment are shown in Fig. 5d–f. The average grain sizes of the control film are 252.41 nm (MAPbI3), 154.58 nm (CsFAPbI3) and 312.20 nm (CsPbI2Br), respectively. However, the grain sizes of the CdBr2-modified perovskite increase, with the average values of 387.26 nm (MAPbI3), 190.25 nm (CsFAPbI3) and 373.85 nm (CsPbI2Br), respectively. Such an enlargement of grain size is, to a large extent, attributed to the incorporation of Br−. As reported, Br− ions are capable of promoting crystal growth.52 All the CdBr2-treated perovskite films present large grains with fewer grain boundaries along the direction perpendicular to the substrate, whereas the control perovskite film shows obviously more grain boundaries between smaller grains, which are the dominant origins of defects in perovskite films. The corresponding cross-sectional SEM images were supplemented to further confirm the effect of CdBr2 on perovskite film growth as shown in Fig. S11.† The enlarged grain sizes of perovskite films indicate that the proposed method is beneficial to form high-quality perovskite films, and is able to decrease defect densities and enhance the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. S13†) show that the root mean square (RMS) roughness of the MAPbI3 perovskite film decreases from 15.8 nm (pristine) to 12.9 nm (CdBr2-treated), and the RMS roughness values of CsFAPbI3 perovskite films without and with CdBr2 treatment are found to be 25.4 and 21.7 nm, respectively, verifying a smooth film morphology after CdBr2 post-treatment.

The corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained to study the effect of CdBr2 on perovskite film crystallization and grain orientation (Fig. 5g–i). The diffraction peaks of the perovskite film with CdBr2 show a stronger intensity, indicating a higher crystallinity and a larger domain size for CdBr2-treated films. The (110) peak of the CdBr2-treated MAPbI3 film moves to a higher angle compared to that of the control film (Fig. S14b†). Apart from that, its full-width-at-half-maximum value is also reduced, because of the smaller atomic radius of Cd2+ than that of Pb2+, suggesting that partial substitution of Pb2+ by Cd2+ occurs in the perovskite crystal lattice during the growth of perovskite grains.36 These XRD observations, together with the SEM and AFM morphology images, suggest that the quality of the perovskite film can be improved and successful substitution of Pb2+ by Cd2+ occurs after treating with CdBr2.
MAPbI3 is a typical perovskite lacking crystal structure stability. On this account, we adopted MAPbI3-based PSCs to evaluate the device stability without encapsulation under the conditions of air, heat, and light-illumination (Fig. 6). The air stability of the MAPbI3-based PSCs without encapsulation was tested under the conditions of 25 °C ± 5 °C and 30% ± 10% RH (Fig. 6a). CdBr2-treated PSCs show much better shelf stability, maintaining 90% of the initial PCE for over 1000 h, while the control device only retains 75.6% under the same conditions. The thermal stability of CdBr2-treated devices shown in Fig. 6b is superior to that of the control one, maintaining 85.2% of the original PCE at 80 °C after 500 h, however, the control device only maintains 63.8% of the initial PCE at the same temperature. In order to investigate the operational stability, light-illumination stability of these devices without encapsulation was measured under one sun continuous illumination in a N2 box (Fig. 6c). It can be found that CdBr2-treated devices still retain 88.5% of their initial efficiencies after 800 h illumination, which is superior to those of control devices (72.1%) with the same illumination duration. Besides, the light-illumination stability tests for CsFAPbI3- and CsPbI2Br-based PSCs were also performed (Fig. S15†). The CdBr2–CsFAPbI3 device retains 85% of its initial PCE after 240 h, while the control one retains only 72% of its initial PCE. In addition, the reference CsPbI2Br-based device quickly loses over 60% of its initial efficiency after 100 h, while the CdBr2-treated devices retain 80% of their original PCEs. We believe that the enhancement of the light-illumination stability is closely related to the suppressed ion migration. The enhanced stability is attributed to the prolonged carrier lifetime and the better quality of perovskite films, which can decrease defects and improve the photovoltaic performance.

Conclusion
In summary, we systematically investigated the valid passivation effect of CdBr2 on the halide vacancies and uncoordinated Pb defects of the MAPbI3 films, and demonstrated its broad applicability in different compositional perovskites such as Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 and CsPbI2Br. CdBr2 post-treatment is found to be capable of prolonging carrier lifetime, decreasing defect amount and improving film quality of the perovskites i.e. MAPbI3, Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3 and CsPbI2Br, as evidenced by spectral and photoelectrochemical measurements. The energy level alignment of the CdBr2-perovskite/carbon interface is more matched, thus reducing the VOC loss. As a result, the photovoltaic performance and the ambient, thermal and illumination stability of the perovskite devices are greatly promoted, with a high efficiency of 16.05% achieved by the CdBr2-modified C-PSCs with the architecture of ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/carbon, exceeding the previous highest PCE record for carbon-based MAPbI3 PSCs. Our work not only provides an effective and universal method to passivate the defects of the perovskite films regardless of composition, but also presents a deep understanding of the relationship of the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs with the defects of perovskite films.
Experimental section
Materials
ITO-patterned substrates were purchased from Shenzhen South China Xiang Cheng Science & Technology Company Limited (sheet resistance = 15 Ω cm−2). Lead iodide (PbI2, > 99.99%), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD, > 99%), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP, 96%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. FAI and MAI were purchased from Greatcell Solar Materials. The SnO2 colloid precursor (tin(IV) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) and CsI (99.999%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%) and isopropanol (IPA, 99.5%) were purchased from J&K Chemical Ltd. Cadmium bromide (CdBr2, ≥ 99.999%), cadmium iodide (CdI2, ≥ 99.999%), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, 99.95%) and acetonitrile (99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Device fabrication
The ITO-patterned substrates were cleaned carefully with deionized water, ethanol, and isopropanol for 20 min, respectively, followed by drying with nitrogen and a treatment for 20 min with UVO plasma in order to remove the organic residues. The 15 wt% SnO2 colloid precursor was diluted using deionized water to 2.67 wt%. The diluted SnO2 solution was spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and then the SnO2 was annealed at 150 °C for 30 min on a hot plate in ambient air. The MAPbI3 perovskite film was fabricated by a two-step spin-coating method. 461 mg PbI2, 633 μL DMF and 71 μL DMSO constitute the PbI2 precursor solution, which was spin coated onto the electron transport layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Briefly MAI precursor solutions (40 mg MAI in 1 mL IPA and 10 μL DMF) were deposited on the PbI2 layer for 30 s, then spin coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed on a hotplate at 110 °C for 10 min. The CsPbI2Br precursor ink was prepared by dissolving 227 mg PbI2, 220 mg PbBr2 and 312 mg CsI in 1 mL DMSO. The CsPbI2Br perovskite layer was prepared using a two-step program (500 rpm for 3 s and 2500 rpm for 25 s). The obtained film was then annealed in two steps (45 °C for 2 min and 160 °C for 10 min). For the CdBr2-treated device, the CdBr2/IPA solution at various concentrations (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg mL−1) was deposited on the just prepared perovskite film by spin coating at 6000 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. Carbon paste was bladed on the perovskite film directly and annealed at 100 °C for 30 min under ambient conditions. The Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3-based PSCs were fabricated according to our previous work.21
