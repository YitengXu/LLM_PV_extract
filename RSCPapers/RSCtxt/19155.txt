Here, we report on how the strain affects the bandgap, optical anisotropy and stability of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–3) microplates, using photoluminescence spectroscopy. Upon applying external strain, the bandgap decreases at a rate of −5.60/−2.74/−1.38 meV per % for n = 1, 2, and 3 2D perovskites, respectively. This change of the bandgap can be ascribed to the distortion of the octahedra (Pb–I bond contraction) in 2D perovskites, supported by a study on emission anisotropy, which increases with the increase of strain. In addition, the external strain can significantly deteriorate the stability of 2D perovskites due to the strain induced distortion which would make the penetration of moisture and oxygen into the perovskite microplates easier, resulting in much faster degradation rates. Our findings not only provide insights into the design and optimization of functional devices, but also provide a new approach to improve the stability of 2D perovskite based devices.
Introduction
Strain engineering offers an efficient strategy to understand and tune the properties of semiconductor structures and to introduce new functionalities for use in electronic and optoelectronic devices.1–5 Strain can be intentionally applied or naturally formed during the growth of materials.4–9 Previous studies reveal that strain would lead to the emission peak shift and exciton fine splitting, and change of the electrical conductance and carrier mobility.10–12 In addition, strain can enhance inter-phase optical transitions and create pseudo-heterostructures to function as the traditional heterostructures.13 All these effects induced by strain, either internal or external strain, enable us to deeply understand the properties of materials and extend the new functionalities of the materials for potential applications.
The emerging two-dimensional (2D) hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have attracted increasing attention due to their excellent environmental stability and a natural quantum well structure compared to recent 3D perovskites showing great photovoltaic potential.14–21 In addition, 2D perovskites possess unique optical properties such as greatly tunable bandgaps due to the number of layers and chemical compositions,22–25 extremely large exciton binding energy due to the dielectric confinement and enhanced self-trapped states.26–28 These unique features make 2D perovskites attractive for potential optoelectronic applications in solar cells,29,30 light-emitting devices,31–33 photodetectors27,34–38 and lasers.39,40
According to previous reports, it is inevitable to introduce the strain in the perovskite synthesis process. For example, the contaminations on the surfaces of assembled perovskite crystals would result in natural hydrocarbon-filled bubbles between the crystals and flat substrates and thus introduce strain within the crystals.41,42 As a consequence, the introduced strain would affect the power conversion efficiency and stability of the perovskite-based solar cells.8,11 In particular, the excellent optical properties of 2D perovskites render them very promising for use in flexible optoelectronic devices,15,43 which must be able to withstand considerable strain to meet the bending requirement.7,44 However, how strain affects the optical properties and stability of 2D perovskites is still largely unexplored, and has great importance not only for fundamental investigations but also for designing new device structures with improved performance and new functionalities.
In this work, we report on how strain affects the bandgap, optical anisotropy and stability of 2D perovskite (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–3) microplates, using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. External tunable strain was applied onto 2D perovskite microplates via a silicon substrate with patterned pillars.45 Upon application of external strain, the emission peak shows a redshift as the strain increases and the degree of emission peak shift relies on the number of layers n in the microplates. Furthermore, the applied strain would increase the optical anisotropy and deteriorate the stability of the microplates. We expect that our studies would not only provide useful insights into the design and optimization of functional devices, but also provide a new approach for improving the stability of 2D perovskite based devices.
Results
To introduce strain into 2D perovskite microplates, we first pattern arrays of nanopillars on silicon dioxide/silicon (SiO2/Si) substrates via electron beam lithography and inductively coupled plasma etching. Fig. 1a displays the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the as-fabricated substrate with nanopillars. The spacing between adjacent nanopillars is around 4 μm and the diameter of the pillars is 800 nm. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image reveals that the nanopillars are 55 ± 10 nm in height (Fig. 1b). Subsequently, we mechanically exfoliated thin 2D perovskite microplates from their bulk crystals on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer and transferred them to a prefabricated patterned nanopillar substrate with the aid of a microscope to investigate their optical properties under strain (Fig. 1c).16 The optical microscopy (OM) image shows a distinct color contrast for perovskite microplates with and without applied strain (Fig. 1c).

Fig. 1d shows the PL spectra of n = 1–3 microplates with (w/t) and without (w/o) application of external strain, which are acquired from the microplates on nanopillars and on the flat substrate, respectively. Only one emission peak for all n = 1–3 microplates was observed, suggesting the phase purity of the as-prepared microplates. According to previous reports, the broad emission peak can be attributed to the free exciton emission.22,26 Apparently, the applied strain would lead to a redshift and broadening of the emission peak for all n = 1–3 microplates, similar to previous studies on other semiconductor structures.46,47 We fabricated nanaopillars with 400 nm and 800 nm diameters. The microplates on nanopillars of different diameters exhibited consistent behaviour of decreasing band gaps after application of strain (Fig. S1†). Therefore, in the rest of the manuscript, we focus on the microplates on 800 nm diameter nanopillars.
In order to clearly visualize the strain effect in PL spectra in detail, fluorescence images were obtained and spatially resolved PL mappings were further performed on each pure phase n = 1–3 perovskite microplates on a patterned nanopillar substrate (Fig. 2a–o). Noticeable color difference can be seen in optical images of the as-exfoliated n = 1–3 microplates on the nanopillars compared with those on the flat substrate, which indicates that strain has been successfully introduced into the n = 1–3 2D perovskite microplates in the nanopillar region (Fig. 2a, f and k). Fluorescence images show bright spots at the positions of nanopillars, indicating that the emission intensity is enhanced by strain for all n = 1–3 2D perovskite microplates (Fig. 2b, g and l). Similarly, PL mappings also reveal the enhancement of the PL intensity in the strain region for all n = 1–3 perovskite microplates (Fig. 2c, h and m). Additionally, the centers of the bright spots are generally brighter than the edges, which can be ascribed to the decrease of the strain at the edge of spots. Furthermore, the emission peak shows a redshift and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) has been significantly broadened in the strain region (Fig. 2d, i, n, e, j and o). It should be noted that the PL variance of the samples with the same thickness before applying the strain is lesser than that after applying strain. For example, the standard deviation (0.126 nm) of the PL peak extracted from randomly selected six unstrained data points shown in Fig. 2d is much smaller than the PL peak change (>1 nm) after applying strain. While the red-shift of the emission peak in the strain region can be attributed to the strain induced change of the lattice constants, the broadening of the emission peak is due to the strain induced broadening, both of which have been observed in a number of semiconductor structures.9,47,48 The enhancement of the emission intensity probably originated from the exciton funneling effect.41,48 The center of the nanopillars has the maximum strain, which leads to the smallest bandgap of perovskite microplates. As a result, the photogenerated excitons would funnel to the center of the nanopillars, giving rise to the strongest emission intensity.

The scale bars are 2 μm. 
To quantitatively characterize how the bandgap evolves with the applied strain, we change the strength of the applied strain by tuning the height of the nanopillars.49 The introduced strain ε in 2D perovskite microplates can be estimated via ε = h/(2R), where h is the thickness of the flakes and R is the radius of curvature. R can be determined by R2 = (R − σ)2 + (ω/2)2, where σ and ω are the height and the diameter of the ‘tent’ formed by nanopillars, respectively. Since the color of all the PL mappings and fluorescence images of the microplates shown in Fig. 2 suggest that the plates we used have uniform thickness, the values for h, σ and ω can be extracted from the AFM images (Fig. S2†). As the applied strain continuously increases, the emission peaks exhibit a continuous redshift for all n = 1–3 perovskite microplates. In order to determine the emission peak position precisely, the emission peak was extracted by multiple peak fittings using the Voigt function. Fig. S3† displays the PL spectra with the fitting results for (BA)2PbI4 (n = 1) as an example. The extracted emission peak (520.12 nm) and the low-energy shoulder (LS) can be attributed to the free exciton emission and self-trapped exciton emission, respectively, according to previous reports.22,50,51 The trend can be seen more clearly in the emission peak position versus strain, as shown in Fig. 3d–f. Through a linear fit to the experimental data, the change rate of the bandgap with the applied strain is calculated to be about −5.60 meV per %, −2.74 meV per %, and −1.38 meV per % for n = 1–3, respectively. This is expected since the larger the applied strain, the larger the bandgap changes.

According to the previous report, the change in the band gap of 2D perovskite microplates with strain has two possible origins including the distortion of the inorganic octahedral structure (the [PbI6]4− octahedral tilting, and Pb–I bond contraction) and the change of the interlayer distance.2,52,53 The increased [PbI6]4− octahedral tilting likely decreases the orbital overlap, thus decreasing band dispersion and increasing the bandgap.52 The Pb–I bond contraction induces the opposite effect by increasing the orbital overlap and band dispersion, thereby decreasing the bandgap.52 Based on the fact that the structure of low-n 2D perovskites is much more distorted compared to that of high-n 2D perovskites,17 we conclude that the Pb–I bond contraction plays a dominant role over the [PbI6]4− octahedral tilting for low-n 2D perovskites, which results in a decrease in the bandgap after the application of strain (Table S1†). Assuming that the distortion of the octahedron is the main factor responsible for bandgap change, the optical anisotropy of the perovskite microplates should increase with the increase of strain due to the strain induced lattice distortion.54 In contrast, optical anisotropy should remain the same if the change of the interlayer distance is the reason for the change of the bandgap.
To identify the primary factor behind the strain induced bandgap change in our 2D perovskite microplates, polarization-resolved PL studies have been carried out. Fig. 4a displays the schematic illustration of the polarization-resolved PL measurement configuration, where a quarter-wave plate was used to generate circularly polarized light to excite the microplates in order to exclude the influence of absorption anisotropy. To detect the polarization of the emitted light, a half wave plate coupled with a linear polarizer was utilized. Fig. 4b displays the polarization resolved PL spectra for two representative polarization angles. While a negligible change in the PL spectra was observed for the region without strain, the PL spectra showed a noticeable change of intensity under the external strain. To clearly understand how the external strain affects the polarization evolution of emission, the emission intensity was extracted and plotted against the polarization angle for the region with and without strain, both of which can be fitted by a cosine function with a period of π (Fig. 4c). The two-lobed shape suggests the presence of the optical anisotropy in our 2D perovskite microplates. To characterize the degree of optical anisotropy, the emission polarization ratio was introduced, which is defined as (Imax − Imin)/(Imax + Imin). Imax and Imin are the maximum and the minimum values of PL intensities.54,55 Based on the fitting results, the estimated emission polarization ratios are 0.9% for the strained region and 1.7% for the unstrained region, which reveals that the external strain can enhance optical anisotropy. Furthermore, the optical anisotropy continuously increases with the increase of the external strain at a rate of 0.45 per % (Fig. 4d). All these observations on the optical anisotropy evolution with strain support that the distortion of octahedra in 2D perovskite microplates is responsible for the redshift of the emission peak under external strain.

The solid lines are the fitted results by a cosine (line) function with a period of π. (d) The polarization ratio of (BA)2PbI4 microplate versus strain. The red dashed line is the linearly fitted result. 
Furthermore, the distortion of octahedra in 2D perovskite microplates under strain is expected to affect their stability, which would significantly affect their optoelectronic applications. To monitor the stability of 2D perovskite microplates under strain, PL spectra are continuously acquired every 6 seconds. The time evolution of the PL intensity shows a similar behavior for n = 1–3 2D perovskite microplates with or without strain: the PL intensities of all microplates exhibit a gradual decrease with time (Fig. 5a–c). The extracted integrated intensities versus time suggests that the emission intensities of both the strained and unstrained regions linearly decease with time and the emission intensity of the strained region degrades much faster than that of the unstrained region for all n = 1–3 2D perovskite microplates (Fig. 5d–f). The degradation rates, and the slopes of the integrated intensity versus time, strongly depend on the magnitude of the strain applied (Fig. 5g–i). This is probably because the strain-induced distortion would make the penetration of moisture and oxygen into the perovskite microplates easier, resulting in the much faster degradation rates. In order to demonstrate this claim, we compared the fluorescence mappings of the strained microplates without and with PDMS encapsulation in air. A quicker degradation can be observed from the continuous fluorescence mapping of (BA)2PbI4 (n = 1) microplates in air for 0 s–100 s (Fig. S4(a)–(c)†) compared with that for the microplate encapsulated by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp for 0 s–180 s ((Fig. S4(d)–(e)†). The extracted PL intensities versus time suggests that the emission intensity of the strained region (w/t1) in air degrades much faster than that (w/t2) with PDMS encapsulation for (BA)2PbI4 microplates, which indicated that the oxygen and water in air play an important role in the degradation of 2D perovskites. This is consistent with the previous reports from both experimental and theoretical aspects.56–59 Nonetheless, further investigations are required to clarify the detailed underlying mechanism.

Conclusions
In summary, we systematically investigated how strain affects the bandgap, optical anisotropy and stability of 2D perovskite microplates. The applied strain would lead to a redshift of the bandgap, enhancement of the optical anisotropy and a fast degradation rate. These observations can be ascribed to the strain induced distortion of the octahedra (Pb–I bond contraction). Our studies are not only of great significance to extend the functionalities of 2D perovskite based optoelectronic devices, but also have important implications for improving the stability of 2D perovskite based devices.

 	Fig. 1  (a) SEM image of the as-fabricated substrate with nanopillars (4 μm separation). The scale bar is 2 μm. (b) AFM image and the height profile of a typical as-fabricated nanopillar (top). The scale bar is 1 μm. (c) Illustration of the device fabrication process and the optical image of the as-exfoliated 2D perovskite (BA)2PbI4 microplates on the nanopillars (bottom). The scale bar is 4 μm. (d) The normalized PL spectra of the 2D perovskite (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–3) microplates with (w/t) and without (w/o) external strain.	 

 	Fig. 2  The optical microscopy images (a), (f) and (k), fluorescence images (b), (g) and (l), PL intensity mappings (c), (h) and (m), PL wavelength mappings (d), (i) and (n), FWHM mappings (e), (j) and (o) of the as-exfoliated 2D perovskite (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1(n = 1, 2 and 3) microplates on the nanopillars. The scale bars are 2 μm.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a)–(c) The normalized PL spectra of (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–3) microplates under different magnitudes of strain. (d)–(f) The band gap of (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 1–3) microplates versus strain. The red dashed lines are linearly fitted results.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) The schematic illustration of the polarization-resolved PL measurement configuration. (b) The polarization resolved PL spectra of (BA)2PbI4 for two representative polarization angles (w/t@60°, 150°, w/o@60°, 150°: orange, red, gray, and black squares) in the presence or absence of strain. (c) The extracted PL intensity versus polarization angle in a polar plot of the region both with and without strain. The solid lines are the fitted results by a cosine (line) function with a period of π. (d) The polarization ratio of (BA)2PbI4 microplate versus strain. The red dashed line is the linearly fitted result.
