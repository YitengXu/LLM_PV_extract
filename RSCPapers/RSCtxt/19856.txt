Solid electrolyte membranes have been adopted in a variety of HT-MSBs, including sodium–sulfur and sodium–metal halide batteries, liquid metal batteries, and molten air batteries to improve the battery performance. In this review, we summarize the various types of solid electrolyte membrane-containing HT-MSBs, underline the significance of molten salts and solid electrolyte membranes as well as their synergy and interaction, and discuss the advantages of high-temperature batteries. We expect that this review can provide a new viewpoint for improving battery architecture and enhancing battery performance, as well as the advantages of HT-MSBs for future multi-energy complementary integrated energy systems.
1. Introduction
The development and utilization of renewable energy are crucial in modern society in order to construct a low-carbon and eco-friendly energy system.1 The battery energy storage system (BESS) has been heralded as the most promising solution to solve the volatility and intermittency problems of renewable energy.2 Classic battery storage technologies, such as lead-acid,3 lithium-ion,4 sodium–sulfur,5 and redox-flow,6 are now widely used in large-scale battery installations to complement solar photovoltaic and wind power generation, and have been commercialized all over the world in the form of energy storage stations.7 With the exponential growth of renewable energy power generation, the vast demand for battery energy storage stimulates the rapid development of rechargeable batteries toward low cost and high performance.8–11
Utilizing a rechargeable high-temperature molten salt electrolyte-based battery (HT-MSB) is one of the promising approaches to a large-scale stationary BESS with competitive advantages that extend beyond the capacity and safety performance to economic efficiency.12–15 The use of low-cost and earth-abundant inorganic salts as high-temperature electrolytes is the most distinguishing feature of HT-MSBs, and these nontoxic molten salt electrolytes are chemically stable and non-flammable even in air or O2 at high temperatures. Furthermore, these molten salt electrolytes have exceptional electrochemical properties such as ultrahigh ion conductivities and wide electrochemical windows, allowing for more affordable electrode materials and electrochemical redox processes for HT-MSBs.16–18 On the other side, HT-MSBs are specific high-temperature electrochemical energy storage devices that involve heat and electricity, capable of collaborating with other high-temperature energy conversion technologies such as molten salt thermal energy storage (MS-TES) and high-temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE) to construct a multi-energy complementary utilization system.19–21
Various HT-MSB devices for large-scale electricity storage are currently being developed, including sodium sulfur (NAS) batteries,22–24 Na–NiCl2 (ZEBRA, ZEolite Battery Research Africa) and sodium metal-halide (Na-MH) batteries,25–29 liquid metal batteries (LMBs),30–32 solid electrolyte-based liquid lithium (SELL) batteries,33–35 and molten air batteries (MABs).36–38 In terms of technological maturity, the NAS battery is the most successful scaled battery energy storage technology, with commercial 100 megawatt level electric energy storage power stations built all over the world following decades of continuous development.39 LMBs have been regarded as a disruptive technology for grid-level energy storage, and several LMB-based BESS projects with more than 4 hours duration are under construction.40 SELLs are by far the most recent generation of ZEBRA-type batteries, which might emerge as a high-performance and cost-effective option for grid-scale energy storage. MABs offer an ultra-high potential energy density due to their unique multi-electron storage mechanism,41 and MAB prototypes have demonstrated excellent viability for large-capacity BESSs.42,43
In order to increase battery performance, a solid electrolyte membrane (SEM) has been used in the rational design of HT-MSB devices (Fig. 1). The sodium-ion conductive beta-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) has been used in NAS, ZEBRA and other Na-MH batteries to separate liquid sodium and metal halides,44–47 garnet-type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) has been fully utilized as the lithium-ion conductive solid electrolyte to construct SELL batteries,48–51 and the operating temperature of both two ZEBRA-type batteries is between 200 and 350 °C. Oxide-ion conductive yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) has been used in MABs to build bi-phase electrolyte iron-oxygen batteries and quasi-solid-state electrolyte molten salt iron-air batteries,52,53 with an operating temperature of 800 °C. Porous TiN can be used as the faradaic membrane to improve the performance of LMBs,54 and the operating temperature of these TiN-containing LMBs is between 410 and 440 °C. Incorporating solid electrolyte membranes in HT-MSBs improves the battery performance as well as battery design, and hence is critical for the development of large-scale energy storage batteries.
 Fig. 1  A summary of solid-electrolyte membrane-containing high-temperature molten salt electrolyte-based batteries. 
In recent years, grand efforts have been made in the investigation and development of HT-MSBs, with most studies focusing on liquid sodium/lithium batteries,55–57 as well as electrolytes58–60 and electrode materials.28,61 Nonetheless, SEM-containing HT-MSBs, including battery design and key battery materials (i.e., SEMs and molten salts), have received little attention. In this review, we outline the recent advancement of SEM-containing HT-MSBs with operating temperatures over 200 °C, including NAS, ZEBRA, Na-MH and SELL batteries, MLBs and MABs. We emphasize the importance of molten salts and SEMs as well as their synergy and interaction in SEM-containing HT-MSBs. We also update the discussion on the advantages of high-temperature batteries for future multi-energy complementary integrated energy systems. We anticipate that this study can provide a fresh perspective and in-depth understanding towards the future development of high-performance HT-MSBs.
2. Current progress of SEM-containing HT-MSBs
2.1. Historical investigations
The development of solid electrolyte membrane-containing high-temperature molten salt electrolyte-based batteries can be traced back to thermal active batteries (TABs) in the 1940s, as shown in Fig. 2. TABs are the first molten salt electrolyte-based high-temperature energy storage devices developed for military and aerospace applications.62–64 TABs are primary batteries that operate at temperature ranging from 300 to 550 °C, and molten fluorides, chlorides, and bromides of alkali and alkaline earth metals and their low eutectic mixtures have been used as ion-conducting electrolytes to separate the negative and positive electrodes.65,66 Kummer J. T. and Weber N. at the Ford Motor Company developed NAS batteries in 1966, which used BASE as the ceramic separating membrane between liquid sodium and sulfur and had an operating temperature range of 300 to 350 °C.67 Coetzer J. proposed a Na–NiCl2 battery in 1986 by using molten sodium tetrachloroaluminate (NaAlCl4) as the secondary electrolyte in the positive electrode section to avoid battery failure caused by BASE membrane cracking.25 Based on the Na–NiCl2 battery, low-cost and low-melting inorganic halides such as Co, Fe, Cu, and Mo chlorides have been used to build cost-efficient Na-MH batteries with operating temperature ranging from 200 to 280 °C.68,69 Cui Y. et al. developed a series of SELL batteries based on LLZTO solid electrolyte tubes, and the operating temperature of these SELL batteries is in the range of 200–300 °C.14,48–51 Sadoway D. et al. revitalized LMB technology and introduced a new type of low-cost and high-performance LMB for grid-level energy storage, with operating temperatures ranging from 400 to 700 °C.12,70 Porous TiN membranes have been incorporated into LMBs as a faradaically selective membrane for the Faraday reduction of the susceptible transition-metal ions in molten salt electrolytes in order to increase the ion selectivity of molten salt electrolytes.54 Licht S. et al. established MABs with respective intrinsic volumetric energy capacities by using multivalent transition metals as the negative electrode materials.13 YSZ membranes are currently being used in MABs for the construction of a bi-phase molten salt iron-oxygen battery and a quasi-solid-state (QSS) molten salt iron-air battery,52,53 and the operating temperature of these YSZ-containing MABs is 800 °C, which is higher than that of other HT-MSBs. These solid electrolyte membranes are categorized as cation-conducting electrolyte membranes (CMs) or anion-conducting electrolyte membranes (AMs) based on the conducting ions, and the faradaic membrane (FM) that conducts electrons can also be employed in HT-MSBs. The detailed parameters and performances of various HT-MSBs are listed in Table 1 in accordance with the corresponding references.

2.2. CM-containing HT-MSBs
BASE and LLZTO are the cation-conducting solid electrolytes used in HT-MSBs, and the former conducts sodium ions while the latter conducts lithium ions. The BASE-containing HT-MSBs are Na-β-alumina batteries (NBBs) such as NAS, ZEBRA, and other Na-MH batteries, and the LLZTO-containing HT-MSBs are SELL batteries. In these CM-containing HT-MSBs, the negative electrode materials are liquid sodium or lithium, and the separators are BASE or LLZTO membranes. The positive region of these CM-containing HT-MSBs, as shown in Fig. 3a, consists of conductive skeletons of metal or carbon, electrochemically active positive components such as sulfur and transition metals known as intermediate hard metals, and low melting point molten salt electrolytes. The characteristic cell voltages of different types of Na-β-alumina batteries are shown in Fig. 3b, and the representative stationary energy storage installations based on commercialized Na-β-alumina batteries are listed in Table 2.

2.2.1. NAS batteries. 
The sodium sulfur battery is the first type of high-temperature rechargeable molten salt battery with the use of a solid oxide electrolyte, and it has been widely applied for large scale electrical energy storage due to the use of inexpensive materials, long cycle lifetime, and high specific energy and power.57 The NAS battery was originally developed by Ford Motor Company for electric vehicle (EV) and space applications in 1966, and successfully commercialized by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and NGK Isolator Ltd for utility-scale stationary energy storage in 2003. To date, more than 200 stationary NAS-based BESSs with power above 500 kW have been established all over the world, primary for stabilizing large-scale solar and wind power generation.95 The representative stationary energy storage applications of the NaS battery are listed in Table 2.
Owing to their low cost, long cycle life, and high specific energy and power, NAS batteries have been widely used for large-scale electrical energy storage (Fig. 4a). The negative and positive electrode materials in typical NAS batteries are liquid sodium and molten sulfur (which is usually impregnated into graphite felt), respectively, with the separator being a ceramic sodium-conducting BASE membrane.96 Because they are entirely sealed, NAS batteries are environmentally benign, and more than 99% of the battery material can be recycled.97 Furthermore, earth-abundant sodium and sulfur resources (compared to lithium), a mature ceramic module manufacturing process and automatic battery module production enable NAS cells to be produced economically and efficiently. In practice, the coulombic efficiency of NAS batteries is almost 100% within the normal range of operating voltage (1.8–2.1 V versus Na/Na+), and the specific energy and power of NAS batteries are in the range of 110–145 W h kg−1 and 60–80 W kg−1, respectively. The depth of discharge (DoD) and the total round-trip energy efficiency (after accounting for thermal losses) of NAS batteries are in the range of 90–100% and 75–90%, respectively, both of them are determined by the discharge rate.71
 Fig. 4  (a) Schematic illustration of the NAS battery,46 (b) the OCV of the NAS battery at each state of charge,99 and (c) crystal structures of β-Al2O3 and β′′-Al2O3.45 
The electrons migrate from the liquid sodium to the external circuit with the release of electric power during discharge, while the remaining sodium ions diffuse through the BASE membrane and react with molten sulfur to generate sodium polysulfides.57 As shown in Fig. 3b, the cell voltage (2.08 V) remains constant at 350 °C over the region of high state of charge, corresponding to the discharge product of sodium pentasulfide (immiscible with molten sulfur). After the sulfur was exhausted, the cell voltage declines linearly and ends at 1.74 V, corresponding to the formation of stoichiometric sodium polysulfides (Na2S5, Na2S4 and Na2S3) in a single liquid phase region (Fig. 4b).98 As the battery discharges further, the cell voltage remains constant at 1.74 V until the component eventually transforms to the non-conductive solid Na2S2 (Tm 470 °C), and the battery loses rechargeability.99 As a result, the discharge voltage should be limited to 1.78 V, and the NAS batteries should be limited to approximately one-third of their theoretical capacity (1675 mA h g−1).100
The ceramic BASE membrane exhibits high ionic conductivity and good isolation for both molten electrodes in NAS batteries operating at 300–350 °C, allowing it to serve not only as a separator to avoid the vigorous chemical reaction between molten sodium and sulfur, but also as a solid electrolyte for reversible sodium ion transport between two molten electrodes.46 The basic structure of BASE is a layer-structured conductor with alternating closely packed and loosely packed layers, with the loosely packed layers being conduction slabs where sodium ions are free to migrate under the electric field, and the closely packed layers being four-layer oxygen ion stacks with aluminium ions in both octahedral and tetrahedral interstices.101 In terms of oxygen stacking sequence and chemical composition, β-alumina has two different crystal structures (Fig. 4c),102 hexagonal β-Al2O3 (Na2O·xAl2O3, x = 8–11) and rhombohedral β′′-Al2O3 (Na2O·xAl2O3, x = 5–7), and β′′-Al2O3 has a relatively higher ionic conductivity (typically 0.2–0.4 S cm−1 at 300 °C) due to the larger lattice volume and higher Na+ concentration.45 Furthermore, the Na-ion conductivity of single crystal β′′-Al2O3 (∼1 S cm−1 at 300 °C and ∼0.1 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively) is higher than that of polycrystalline β′′-Al2O3 (∼0.3 S cm−1 at 300 °C and ∼0.002 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively). The high Na-ion conductivity should be attributed to the absence of grain boundary effects.103 Moreover, doping elements can improve the conductivity of both single crystal and polycrystalline β′′-Al2O3 as well. For example, doping Nb5+ can substitute the Al3+ sites in Na-ion conductive layers, reducing the steric effect and thus improving the ion conductivity of β′′-Al2O3.104 Doping MgO is able to improve the Na-ion conductivity of β′′-Al2O3via increasing the content of the β′′-Al2O3 phase and Na-ion concentration.105 Other oxides such as Li2O, TiO2, and ZrO2 have been doped or co-doped in β′′-Al2O3 for enhancing the Na-ion conductivity.106–109
NAS batteries have been used for large-scale energy storage all over the world, but increased safety concerns associated with the electrode and electrolyte materials, such as flammable molten sodium and sulfur, corrosive sodium polysulfides and fragile BASE, contribute to potentially catastrophic batter failures.88 One concern is the rupture of the BASE membrane.110–112 It would cause an immediate chemical interaction between molten sodium and sulfur, releasing a tremendous amount of heat and increasing the risk of fire and explosion. Another concern is overcharging and overdischarge. Overcharging the NAS battery is hazardous because it damages the BASE membrane, especially at high charging voltages, most probably due to electrical breakdown caused by sodium deposition in the ceramics. Overdischarge, on the other hand, can degrade the NAS battery due to the formation of solid Na2S2, particularly at inhomogeneous locations inside the battery and between the electrodes. Current research focuses on the development of intermediate-temperature (IT, 150–200 °C) and room-temperature (RT) NAS batteries.113–115 However, lowering the operating temperature drastically reduces the ionic conductivity of the electrolytes in IT- and RT-NAS batteries, resulting in battery performance (i.e. current and power density) not comparable to that of NAS batteries operating at 300–350 °C. Wang D. et al. designed IT-NAS batteries with a dual electrolyte consisting of a BASE membrane and inorganic ionic liquids, where the former prevents the polysulfide shuttle effect and the latter accelerates the positive reactivity by improving the dissolution of sulfur and polysulfides, and the combination of both electrolytes significantly improves the cycling performance of IT-NAS batteries.116
Although the NAS battery is a commercialized HT-MSB, the safety issue is still the key challenge for its application in large-scale energy storage.57 Under high operating temperatures, both sodium and sulfur are liquid and unsafe substances, while the BASE is a brittle membrane, which is extremely prone to be attacked by molten sodium. Once it breaks, liquid Na and S come into direct contact, triggering a violent exothermic reaction that can rapidly result in fire, explosion, and other safety incidents. Lowering the operating temperature has been regarded as an effective way to improve battery safety, leading to the development of intermediate-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries (IT-NAS, operating at 120–300 °C) and room-temperature sodium–sulfur batteries (RT-NAS).117 Because of the lower operating temperature, the positive and negative materials as well as the electrolyte materials in RT-NAS and IT-NAS batteries differ from those in traditional high-temperature NAS batteries, as do the interface reaction, electrode material conversion mechanism, and battery performance.23,117
Due to the high operating temperature (300–350 °C), the negative and positive electrodes of the HT-NAS battery are molten sodium and sulfur, respectively. Such liquid electrodes can significantly improve mass transfer and electrode/electrolyte wettability, allowing for rapid electrochemical reaction kinetics and reversibility while lowering the interface resistance during battery operation. The IT-NAS battery operates at 150–300 °C, and molten sodium and BASE are employed as the negative electrode and the electrolyte membrane, respectively. Unlike HT-NAS, IT-NAS uses organic solvents such as glymes and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) to dissolve elemental sulfur and Na2S4 as the initial negative electrode, which evolves into Na2S5 and Na2S4 and eventually Na2S4 and Na2S2 throughout the discharge process.23 Therefore, the utilization of sulfur is higher than that of HT-NAS. Nevertheless, the wettability at the interface between molten sodium and the BASE membrane is less than that in HT-NAS due to the relatively lower operating temperature. Moreover, several types of inorganic electrolytes have been developed for IT-NAS, such as Na-based fast ion conductors (e.g.) NASICON, Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (0 < x < 3) and sulfur-based solid electrolytes (i.e., Na3PS4).44 The NASICON electrolyte possesses a superior Na-ion conductivity of 0.15–0.2 S cm−1 at 200 °C due to its 3-dimensional (3D) open-framework structure.118 Doping multivalent metal ions (i.e., La3+ and Zn2+) can reduce the barrier of Na-ion conduction and thus improve the Na-ion conductivity of NASICON.119,120 Na3PS4 is the most representative sulfur-based solid electrolyte with a higher Na-ion conductivity at room temperature in comparison with other analogous oxide-based solid-state electrolytes.121 Aliovalent substitution in S2− and P5+ sites can increase the proportion of Na vacancies or interstitials, resulting in the enhancement of the Na-ion conductivity of Na3PS4. The Na-ion conductivities of Na3SbS4 and Na3PSe4 are 3 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 1.16 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively, both of them are higher than that of glass-ceramic Na3PS4 (4.6 × 10−4 S cm−1).122–125 Doping elements can improve the Na-ion conductivity of Na3PS4 as well. For instance, the Na-ion conductivity of Cl-doped Na3PS4 (Na2.9375PS3.9375Cl0.0625) is 1.14 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 30 °C, with a low activation energy of 0.249 eV.126 The Na-ion conductivity of different types of inorganic solid-state electrolytes are listed in Table 3.

In RT-NAS, solid sodium and sulfur or sulfur composites are employed as negative and positive electrodes, respectively. Inorganic Na-ion conductors and organic solvents with sodium salts have been employed as the electrolytes, the former are inorganic solid-state membranes, and the latter are liquid electrolytes that usually pair with polymer separators. Quasi-solid-state gel polymer electrolytes also have been utilized in RT-NAS owing to their outstanding ionic conductivity as well as excellent electrolyte/electrode interfacial contact. To RT-NAS, the final discharge product is Na2S, corresponding to the considerable theoretical discharge capacity (1675 mA h g−1)140 and energy density (1274 W h kg−1) larger than those of HT-NAS (557 mA h g−1 and 760 W h kg−1, respectively). However, the reaction mechanism in RT-NAS is more complex than that in HT-NAS. During discharge, the conversion from sulfur to Na2S involves a series of long-chain (Na2Sx, 4 < x < 8) and short-chain (Na2Sx, 1 < x < 4) Na polysulfide intermediates. Furthermore, organic electrolytes have significant influence on the electrochemical reaction mechanism in RT-NAS. When using ether-based electrolytes (i.e. TEGDME), the discharge process from sulfur to Na2S involves four stages: (1) a solid–liquid conversion from sulfur (cyclo-S8) to Na2S8 (corresponding to a voltage plateau at ∼2.2 V), (2) a liquid–liquid conversion from Na2S8 to Na2S4 (corresponding to a sloping voltage in the range from ∼2.2 V to 1.65 V), (3) a liquid–solid conversion from Na2S4 to short-chain polysulfides (corresponding to a voltage plateau at ∼1.65 V), (4) a solid–solid transition from Na2S2 to Na2S (corresponding to a sloping voltage in the range from 1.65 V to 1.2 V).117 When using carbonate-based electrolytes (such as ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate), solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers are formed on the surface of both negative and positive electrode materials during the initial discharge process. Protected by the SEI layer, the positive electrode involves a quasi-solid-state conversion from S8 to Na2S2 and Na2S during discharge (corresponding to a mid-value discharge voltage less than 1.6 V).117
The shuttle effect is a major barrier to the RT-NAS battery, leading to a series of battery performance degradation such as low coulombic efficiency, high self-discharge rate and capacity degradation.141–143 In RT-NAS batteries, the sodium polysulfide intermediate products can migrate across the battery separator and react with sodium in the negative electrode area, resulting in the formation of Na2S2 or Na2S layers that deposit on the surface of the negative electrode. Such an insulating layer would induce the irreversible loss of both positive and negative active substances, severely impede charge transfer and increase the internal resistance of the battery. A similar shuttle effect emerges in the room-temperature lithium sulfur battery (RT-LSB) as well. However, the shuttle effect is more serious in RT-NAS batteries than in RT-LSBs, owing to the larger solubility of Na2Sx (4 < x < 8) than Li2Sx (4 < x < 8) in organic electrolytes.23,144–146 Similar to solid electrolyte membrane-containing HT-MSBs, the use of Na-ion selective inorganic solid-state electrolyte membranes in RT-NAS batteries can provide an effective barrier to avoid the migration of sodium polysulfides and protect the battery from the shuttle effect.147 The organic electrolyte not only allows the intermediate polysulfide products to keep highly dissolved in the positive electrode, but also can improve mass transfer at the interface of the solid electrolyte membrane and reduce interface resistance. The inorganic solid-state electrolytes in HT- and RT-NAS batteries (including the BASE, NASICON-based and sulfur-based Na-based fast ion conductors) have been employed in RT-NAS batteries as well.
Another major challenge to the RT-NAS battery is the uncontrollable growth of Na dendrites during cycling charge and discharge.22,148–150 In the RT-NAS battery, the SEI layer is sodium-ion conductive and capable of protecting the sodium electrode from further reaction with the organic electrolyte. However, massive defects are produced in the SEI layer because of the large volume change during cycling stripping and electrodepositing of the sodium electrode, resulting in high current density locations where Na ions are accumulated and Na dendrites are eventually formed.151 Na dendrites can penetrate the battery separator membrane, leading to performance degradation (i.e. cycling capacity and efficiency) and severe safety issues (i.e. short circuit and thermal runaway).152 Because HT- and IT-NAS batteries utilize dense solid electrolyte membranes, sodium polysulfide intermediate products are not allowed to migrate through the solid electrolyte membrane, and no SEI layer is formed on the sodium electrode. In particular, the sodium electrode in HT- and IT-NAS batteries is molten liquid metal that cannot form solid-state dendrites. This is a substantial advantage for all high-temperature liquid metal electrode-based batteries.


2.2.2. ZEBRA batteries. 
The ZEBRA battery was invented by Coetzer in 1978 in South Africa and then improved by BETA Research & Development (UK).153 In 2007, the ZEBRA technology was then acquired by General Electric Company (USA) and the battery brand ‘Durathon’ was established, and it has been successfully applied as the power supply for mining equipment.154 In 2010, FZ SONICK SA was founded by MEA-DEA (Switzerland) and FIAMM (Italy) and the battery brand ‘SONICK’ was established.87 Nowadays, both the Durathon and SONICK batteries have been commercialized and globally applied for EVs, telecom backup power, uninterrupted power supply, renewable resource optimization and power quality.155 The representative stationary energy storage applications of the ZEBRA battery are listed in Table 2.
The ZEBRA battery is the first Na-metal halide battery, which is usually assembled at the discharge state with the use of Ni, NaCl, and AlCl3 as the initial materials, and the BASE membrane as the separator for conducting sodium ions.25 In the operating temperature range of 270–350 °C, molten NaAlCl4 is formed from a 50/50 mixture of NaCl and AlCl3 as the secondary electrolyte and solid-state NaCl and Ni powders are impregnated with it.156 During charge, sodium ions migrate through the BASE membrane and are reduced as liquid sodium in the negative electrode region, and NiCl2 is formed on the surface of Ni powder in the positive electrode region. During discharge, the sodium ions migrate back through the BASE to form NaCl with the chloride ions released from the reduction of NiCl2.157
ZEBRA batteries typically operate at temperatures of about 270–350 °C, to keep the BASE membrane in a low ionic resistance state, and NaAlCl4 in a molten state (melting point 157 °C) for promoting sodium ion transport and the nucleation of Ni and NaCl.158 Furthermore, the BASE membrane also remains in a high electrical resistance state, allowing the batteries to discharge at 100% Ah-efficiency with virtually no self-discharge losses.153 In comparison with NAS batteries, ZEBRA batteries present a higher battery performance including an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 2.58 V, and an actual energy and power density of 140–170 W h L−1 and 250–300 W L−1, respectively.71
Molten NaAlCl4 acts as the secondary electrolyte in ZEBRA batteries, filling the space between the BASE membrane and the porous Ni–NaCl mixture. It can greatly reduce the interfacial resistance inside the battery by improving the interfacial contact and mass transfer kinetics between the electrolyte and active electrode materials. In the case that the BASE membrane ruptures, it can also react with molten sodium to form solid NaCl and metal aluminium, minimizing the risk of catastrophic events such as fire and explosion.25 Furthermore, molten NaAlCl4 can be used as the reactive electrode material to avoid the dangers of overcharging and overdischarging. During overcharging, NaAlCl4 and Ni are converted into Na, AlCl3 and NiCl2 with a higher voltage (3.05 V) than the normal operation, whereas during overdischarge, NaAlCl4 and Na are converted into NaCl and Al with a lower voltage (1.58 V) than the normal operation (Fig. 3b).153 It enables the charging/discharging current to be disconnected automatically to avoid overcharge/overdischarge when the battery's open-circuit voltage is greater than or less than the normal operating voltage.
The performance of the ZEBRA battery is closely associated with the electrochemical mechanism in the positive electrode region, including the particle growth of both Ni and NaCl during charge/discharge cycling161 and the solubility of NiCl2 in molten NaAlCl4.162 Ni/NaCl particle growth can reduce the active surface area of the positive electrode material, resulting in severe electrochemical polarization. Furthermore, high-resistance NiCl2 formed on the surface of Ni particles can restrict the mass transfer of the positive electrode,163–165 and dissolved NiCl2 in molten NaAlCl4 can damage the BASE membrane via ion exchange,166,167 both of which impair the electrochemical reaction. Chemical additives, such as sulfur, NaI and NaBr, were added to the NaCl-saturated molten NaAlCl4 for stabilizing the dissolved NiCl2 as [NiCl4]2− to inhibit the ion exchange with the BASE membrane. Furthermore, using NaI and NaBr as the chemical additives can introduce large-lattice-parameter products (i.e., NiBr2 and NiI2) into the NiCl2 layer, enhancing mass transfer and Ni-utilization.168–170 Iron sulfide was also used as the chemical additive to prevent the formation of a passivation layer, inhibiting the growth and agglomeration of the Ni particles.171 Another promising option for resisting particle growth in electrode materials is the rational design of electrode materials. Wen Z. et al. created three-dimensional electrode materials from conductive carbon fibers, including nickel nanowires (Fig. 5a and b), multiwalled carbon nanotube networks and graphene aerogel, significantly inhibiting Ni and NaCl particle growth while improving the stability of cycling performance (Fig. 5c).159,172,173 Ao X. et al. used Ni3S2-coated Ni particles (Fig. 5d) as an electrode material to build a ZEBRA battery, and the encapsulated Ni3S2 layer reduced Ni particle growth and improved battery performance.160,174 Coating Ni3S2 on Ni particles significantly improved the capacity as well as the stability of cycling performance (Fig. 5e and f). Chang H. et al. constructed a conductive structure with a large electrochemically active surface area using core–shell structured Ni-coated graphite as the positive electrode to improve electron and ion transfer.175 Another advantage of using carbon-based conductive skeletons is that the amount of Ni required in the positive electrode is significantly reduced.

The ZEBRA battery, which has a similar structure to the NAS battery, offers the following advantages including high energy density, high voltage, no exhaust, and zero self-discharge.176 Furthermore, immersing porous Na–Ni in liquid molten salt NaAlCl4 to form a nickel–salt combination significantly improved the effective contact at the microcosmic interface and expanded the ion exchange space, accelerating the material exchange rate and ion transport kinetics at the electrolyte interface and decreasing the interfacial impedance between the solid electrolyte and cathode materials. On the other hand, the ZEBRA battery outperforms the NAS battery in terms of safety. When the ZEBRA battery was overcharged or overdischarged, the molten salt NaAlCl4 would interact with the battery reaction and require a higher voltage. As a result, when the open-circuit voltage exceeds the charge or discharge voltage, the charge or discharge current is automatically disconnected. Moreover, the molten salt NaAlCl4 is capable of effectively addressing the safety hazard challenges presented by the brittle BASE membrane.153 When small cracks emerged on the BASE membrane during battery operation, the molten salt NaAlCl4 would enter the cracks and react with liquid sodium to form NaCl salts and aluminum, filling the cracks and keeping the battery operation safe and stable. When the BASE membrane was severely damaged, the resulting NaCl salts and aluminum would create a short circuit between the positive and negative electrodes, ensuring the safety of the entire BESS operation.


2.2.3. Other Na-MH batteries. 
To lower the ZEBRA battery's material cost, transition metals iron, zinc, and copper were used as Ni particle replacements in the positive electrode. At a temperature of 250 °C, the OCV of a fully charged Na-FeCl2 battery is 2.35 V, whereas overcharging converts iron to Fe3+ and raises the voltage to 2.75 V (Fig. 3b). Although such an overcharging reaction is reversible, the generated Fe3+ ions poison the BASE membrane, resulting in an increase in resistance.75,177,178 In contrast to the ZEBRA battery's single-stage reaction, the Na–FeCl2 battery's electrochemical mechanism is a two-stage reaction that involves the formation of an intermediate phase with the formula Na6FeCl8, and the crystal structures of NaCl, FeCl2 and Na6FeCl8 are shown in Fig. 6a. The fast Na6FeCl8/FeCl2 phase transition mitigates the FeCl2 passivation and facilitates the charge reaction.179 Recently, Ni and sulfur-based chemical additives were employed to enhance the cycle stability of IT Na–FeCl2 batteries (190 °C) by alleviating Fe particle pulverization and chemically etching passivation layers in the positive electrode materials, respectively.75,180 The charge–discharge curve of a typical Na–FeCl2 battery is shown in Fig. 6b.75
 Fig. 6  (a) The crystal structure of NaCl (top left), FeCl2 (right), and Na6FeCl8 (bottom left), and the charge–discharge curve of a typical Na–FeCl2 battery (b),75 phase diagram of eutectic NaCl–ZnCl2 (c)181 and the initial voltage-NaCl utilization plots of a Na–ZnCl2 battery at 280 °C and 240 °C, respectively (d),77 the charge–discharge curves (e) and cycling performance (f) of a typical Na–CuCl2 battery,72 and initial charge–discharge curves of a Na–S/NiCl2 hybrid battery (g)182 and (h),74 respectively. 
The Na–ZnCl2 battery has a complicated electrochemical mechanism that is tightly related to operating temperature. The electromotive force of a typical Na–ZnCl2 battery is ∼2.40 V when operating at 350 °C.183 When the operating temperature is above the eutectic temperature (253 °C), the Na–ZnCl2 battery involves four continuous and reversible processes between solid NaCl and Na2ZnCl4, the eutectic melt of NaCl–ZnCl2, and solid ZnCl2 (Fig. 6c),76,77 while it involves two reversible solid-state electrochemical reactions between solid NaCl, Na2ZnCl4 and ZnCl2 when the operating temperature is below 253 °C (Fig. 6d).181 However, the Na–ZnCl2 battery displayed less polarization and a lower rate of performance degradation at 280 °C compared to 240 °C, which was mostly due to liquid phase formation during cycling at 280 °C. The Na–CuCl2 battery is an appealing option capable of delivering high specific energy and high voltage. Unlike other Na-MH batteries, molten NaAlCl4 is not appropriate for use as the electrolyte in the Na–CuCl2 battery because CuCl2 is soluble in it.184 Ionic liquid electrolytes are a replacement for molten NaAlCl4, which was utilized in the IT Na–CuCl2 battery due to its high temperature and chemical stability. Yang, L. et al. reported a Na–CuCl2 battery with the use of sodium chloride buffered 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloridealuminum chloride as the molten salt electrolyte, which exhibits a discharge plateau at 2.64 V and an energy density of 750 mW h g−1 when operating at 150 °C.73 Niu C. et al. developed a Na–CuCl2 battery with an OCV of 2.65 V at 175 °C utilizing 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide dissolved sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate as the electrolyte to replace sodium chloride saturated sodium tetrachloroaluminate (Fig. 3b). The charge–discharge curves and the cycling performance of such a Na–CuCl2 battery are shown in Fig. 6e and f, respectively. Similar to other Na-MH batteries, the mechanism of performance deterioration in IT Na–CuCl2 batteries was tied closely to passivation caused by CuCl2 accumulation and ionic conductivity loss induced by BASE membrane degradation.72 Recently, Kim B. et al. developed an RT Na–CuCl2 battery with NaAlCl4·2SO2 as the electrolyte, yielding a very high OCV (3.45 V) and energy density (580 W h kg−1). The reversible conversion process between CuCl2 and CuCl with NaCl is responsible for the superior electrochemical performance.185
Moreover, other transition metals such as V, Ag, Ti, Al, Mn, Mo and Co have been investigated as positive electrode materials in Na-MH batteries,27 yet only Co and Mo chlorides showed suitability at 250 °C with OCVs of 2.55 V and 2.64 V, respectively.68 Hybrid ZEBRA batteries, such as Na–S/NiCl2 and Na–Ni/FeCl2, have also been developed to minimize the Ni content in the ZEBRA battery,74,182,186 and their energy densities are comparable to that of the ordinary ZEBRA battery. During the cycling charge and discharge of these hybrid batteries, reversible Na–S or Na–FeCl2 redox reactions have been observed in addition to the reversible Na–NiCl2 redox reaction (Fig. 6g and h).


2.2.4. SELL batteries. 
Very recently, Cui et al. have introduced a novel type of high-temperature solid electrolyte-based liquid lithium battery that uses garnet-type LLZTO as the solid electrolyte, and alloys as well as sulfur and selenium as positive electrode materials (Fig. 7a). The LLZTO solid electrolyte offer excellent ion conductivity, a wide electrochemical window and strong compatibility with liquid metal electrodes, and the LLZTO-based SELL batteries have a considerable energy density advantage over the ZEBRA battery for grid-scale energy storage.33 In the absence of a molten salt electrolyte, SELL batteries have to employ low melting point metal alloys (i.e., Sn–Pb and Bi–Pb) as the positive electrode materials to keep a good contact with the solid electrolyte LLZTO. Furthermore, low melting metal alloys often have high densities and high costs, resulting in a rise in material cost and a drop in energy density.14 In the presence of molten LiAlCl4, solid-state Cu–Zn and Fe–Mo alloys can be used as the positive electrode materials in SELL batteries, and the metal particle growth can be limited by the reversible alloying–dealloying processes during cycling charge and discharge.50,51 The charge–discharge curves of these SELL batteries are shown in Fig. 7b–e. Moreover, molten LiAlCl4 can be used as the positive electrode material in the SELL battery without metal alloys, the OCV and volumetric energy density of such a SELL battery at 210 °C are 1.68 V and 584.1 W h L−1, respectively.49 The OCVs of molten LiAlCl4-involved SELL batteries are higher than those of liquid alloy-involved SELLs. Sulfur and selenium have been used as the positive electrode materials in SELL batteries as well, delivering an energy density exceeding 500 W h kg−1 and 1000 W h L−1 at 240 °C.48

2.3. AM-containing HT-MSBs
A molten air battery usually consists of a couple of metal electrodes impregnated in a molten salt electrolyte with an operating temperature in the range of 500–800 °C. As shown in Fig. 8a, the molten salt conducts oxide ions and dissolves active materials, one metal electrode serves as the positive electrode to form a gas–liquid–solid triple phase interface (TPI) with the molten salt and air, and the other metal electrode serves as a current collector for metal deposition.187–189 During charging, the active materials were electrolyzed to metal and deposited on the negative electrode's surface, while the produced oxide ions were conducted to the positive electrode and reduced as oxygen at the TPI on the positive electrode. As the active material on the positive electrode, oxygen molecules in the air were converted to oxide ions and migrated through the molten salt electrolyte to oxidize the metals on the negative electrode's surface, and the resulting metal oxides were dissolved in the molten salt and electrons were released as the current to the external circuit.13 Nanostructured PdO has been used as an OER/ORR catalyst in the positive electrode for improving the rate performance.158 Metal oxides such as Fe2O3, ZnO, and MgO, as well as TiB2 and VB2, and CO2, have been employed as active materials for the negative electrode,13,83,84,190–193 resulting in an extraordinarily large theoretical volumetric energy capacity due to the unique multi-charge storage mechanism. The charge–discharge curves of iron-air MABs at 800 °C and 500 °C are shown in Fig. 8d and e, respectively.
 Fig. 8  Schematic illustration of conventional (a), YSZ-containing (b), and quasi-solid-state (c) MABs, respectively, and the charge–discharge curves of iron-air MABs at 800 °C (d)13 and 500 °C (e),84 QSS-MAB (f)53 and YSZ-containing MAB (g)52 at 800 °C, respectively. 
The most distinguishing aspect of the MAB battery is its extremely high theoretical energy density. When iron is used as the negative material, the theoretical energy density approaches 10000 W h L−1, which is significantly higher than the energy density of conventional energy storage batteries such as lithium ion batteries (LIBs).13 Furthermore, MABs employ a high-temperature molten salt as the electrolyte to conduct oxide ions, and such a multi-charge transport mechanism favours large-scale energy conversion and storage.193 Moreover, the capacity of the active material in the positive electrode is negligible since MABs consume oxygen in air as the active material. All of these factors provide MABs with an exceptionally high theoretical energy density. Besides that, MABs use high-temperature molten carbonates as electrolytes for oxide ion conduction, whereas CO2 and H2O in air have negligible influence on positive electrodes and electrolytes. This is one of the most notable advantages over aqueous electrolyte-based room-temperature metal–air batteries.194–196 In addition, the MAB battery has a basic construction and a high level of operating safety, and most of the battery materials are low-cost inorganic salts that are environmentally friendly, non-toxic, non-flammable and non-explosive, making MABs ideal for large-scale energy storage.
Molten salt electrolytes in MABs are high-temperature liquids with strong volatilization and corrosion. In MABs, molten salt electrolytes are exposed in air to form an effective TPI in the positive electrode (Fig. 4a), leading to volatilization loss and electrode corrosion.197 Tuning the molten salt electrolyte component can form a tenacious and compact Li nickel oxide nano-scale particle layer on the surface of the nickel electrode to retard corrosion,198 yet the molten salt electrolyte and electrode materials are severely constrained. Furthermore, molten salt electrolytes can not only dissolve metal oxides to form the active materials,199 but also interact with metals to form metal fog during cycling charge and discharge.200 Such metal fog is detrimental to the electrical isolation of the molten salt electrolyte, resulting in a loss in Faraday efficiency, and in extreme cases, an internal short circuit of the MAB.
YSZ is a classical high-temperature solid-state electrolyte with high oxide-ion conductivity that has been widely used in solid oxide fuel cells.201–203 Incorporating YSZ membranes inside MABs offers a possible solution to the performance degradation caused by the molten salt electrolyte volatilization and corrosion. As shown in Fig. 8b, the YSZ membrane separates the positive electrode from the molten salt electrolyte, and a gas–solid–solid TPI is formed in the positive electrode area.52 Because the positive electrode is no longer in contact with the molten salt electrolyte, more low-cost and high-performance electrode materials may be employed in MABs.204,205 On the other hand, the YSZ membrane protects the molten salt electrolyte from exposure to air, reducing molten salt volatilization. During charging, the active materials were electrolyzed on the negative electrode and the resulting oxide ions migrated across the molten salt electrolyte and the YSZ membrane, and then reduced to oxygen at the gas–solid–solid TPI on the positive electrode. The charging process in such a bi-phase electrolyte structured MAB is analogous to solid oxide membrane (SOM) electrolysis.206–208 The charge–discharge curves of such a YSZ-containing MAB are shown in Fig. 8g, and the specific energy and specific power, energy and power density are 129.1 W h kg−1, 2.8 kW kg−1, 388.1 W h L−1, and 21.0 kW L−1, respectively, on the basis of the mass and volume of the molten salt.52 Earlier than YSZ, CaO-stabilized zirconia (CSZ) has been utilized as a solid electrolyte membrane in molten salt batteries in 1988. Sammells A. F. et al. developed a CaO-stabilized zirconia (CSZ) membrane-containing high-temperature Ca–air battery with the use of CaO–CaCl2 as the molten salt electrolyte and CaSi and perovskite oxide La0.89Sr0.10MnO3 the negative and positive electrode materials, respectively. Such a bi-phase Ca–air battery exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 2.07 V at 850 °C, and the faradaic efficiency was above 95% when operating at 20 mA cm−2 for 52 h.81
The mechanism in the negative electrode region can be regulated by the molten salt electrolyte composition. Due to the high solubility of iron oxide in molten lithium carbonate (Li2CO3),209–211 the negative electrode mechanism in a bi-phase electrolyte structured MAB involves a reversible dissolution–deposition process. Due to the limited solubility of iron oxide in molten eutectic K2CO3–Na2CO3, the negative electrode mechanism in a QSS-MAB is a reversible solid-state redox reaction when eutectic K2CO3–Na2CO3 is used as a substitute for Li2CO3,53 and the charge–discharge curves of the QSS-MAB are shown in Fig. 8f. A solid–solid–solid TPI in the negative region mediates this reversible solid-state electrochemical process (Fig. 8c), preventing the formation of metal fog. Furthermore, replacing Li2CO3 with eutectic K2CO3–Na2CO3 can considerably lessen the MAB's material cost.
2.4. FM-containing HT-MSBs
The LMB battery originates from the electrowinning of Al in 1886 and begins with the first design of a three-liquid-layer battery by Hoopes designed for the first time in 1922 for the electrolytic production of high-purity aluminum.30 In the last decade, Sadway revitalised and designed new LMBs including Na–Bi, Mg–Sb and Li–Pb–Sb batteries, and their exceptional performances are suitable for stationary large-scale energy storage.32 In a typical LMB, three immiscible liquid layers were self-stratified due to gravity and the molten salt electrolyte layer is sandwiched between two liquid metal electrode layers (Fig. 5a). The molten salt layer serves as the electrolyte and separator, and the other two liquid metal layers serve as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively. LMBs are stationary energy storage devices that operate at temperatures exceeding 400 °C, using an electrochemical mechanism driven by electronegativity between two liquid metal layers. During discharging, the liquid metal of the negative electrode was dissolved and migrated through the molten salt electrolyte to form an alloy in the positive electrode. During charging, the alloy in the positive electrode was dissolved into metal ions, which migrated back and were reduced as liquid metal floating on the molten salt electrolyte. Since liquid metals are used as electrode materials, MLBs are free of the problems that plague other solid-state metal electrode-containing batteries, such as dendrites, phase deformation, and particle growth. Furthermore, the charge and mass transfer efficiency in both liquid metal electrodes and the molten salt electrolyte and particularly at their interfaces are extremely high, resulting in a low ohmic impedance loss and high charging and discharging current densities.
A LMB uses liquid metal as the electrode material to avoid the formation of dendrites during electrodeposition. The electrode materials also avoid phase transition and particle size change during the charge–discharge process. It can be considered that the fluidity of liquid metal allows the electrode to recover and maintain its initial state during the cycling charge and discharge, so that LMBs are capable of bypassing the electrode degradation process encountered in traditional batteries and hence significantly extending the cycle life.31 Furthermore, the charge and material transport efficiency is particularly high in liquid metal electrodes and high temperature molten salt electrolytes, resulting in a low ohmic impedance loss. Liquid diffusion enables efficient transport and rapid charge transfer dynamics of reactive materials, especially in the large ion exchange space at the electrolyte–electrode interface, allowing the LMB to be charged and discharged at high current density.58,212 Moreover, the LMB offers the advantages of a simple structure and easy assembly due to the natural stratification of the liquid metal electrode and liquid molten salt. It is highly adaptable and has great potential to be extended for large-scale energy storage.
Low density metals (such as Li, Na, Ca, and Mg) and high density metals and alloys (such as Bi, Pb, Sb, Sn, and Zn) can be utilized as negative and positive electrode materials, respectively, whereas alkali and alkaline earth metal halide eutectics can be used as molten salt electrolytes in MLBs.213–218 Metal solubility in molten salts is a major challenge in LMBs, as it reduces the electrolytes' electrical conductivity and causes self-discharge. Using multi-cation molten salt electrolytes and alloy electrodes, as well as lowering the operating temperature, allows for the suppression of metal solubility in molten salt electrolytes and an enhancement in LMB performance.219–223 Wang K. et al. designed a Li‖LiF–LiCl–LiI‖Sb–Pb liquid metal battery, showing 98% coulombic efficiency and 73% round-trip energy efficiency with charge–discharge current densities of 275 mA cm−2 at 450 °C, and the charge–discharge curves at different current densities are shown in Fig. 9c.12 Xu J. et al. assembled a Na‖NaCl–CaCl2–ZnCl2‖Zn liquid metal battery by using a porous magnesia stabilized zirconia diaphragm to physically separate the two cell compartments, and the discharge voltage was over 0.8 V with a current density of 200 mA cm−2 at 560 °C.80 Bradwell D. et al. reported a Mg‖MgCl2–KCl–NaCl‖Pb liquid metal battery with the operating temperature at 700 °C, and the voltage was ∼0.2 V when discharging at a current density of 200 mA cm−2.70 Ning X. et al. used a Ca–Pb alloy as the negative electrode to build a Ca‖LiCl–NaCl–CaCl2‖Pb liquid metal battery, with a discharge voltage of 0.8 V when the current density was 200 mA cm−2 at 600 °C.79 Ca–Mg alloys were also used as the negative electrode materials to construct Ca–Mg‖LiCl–CaCl2‖Bi liquid metal batteries, and the discharge voltage was ∼0.5 V and ∼0.7 V with a current density of 200 mA cm−2 at 650 °C when using 20–80 mol% and 90–10 mol% Ca–Mg alloys, respectively. When the operating temperature was reduced from 650 °C to 550 °C, the self-discharge current density decreased from ∼4 mA cm−2 to less than 1 mA cm−2 in the Ca–Mg (90–10 mol%)‖LiCl–CaCl2‖Bi liquid metal battery, corresponding to a coulombic efficiency increase from ∼96% to ∼99% with a cycling current density of 200 mA cm−2.78
 Fig. 9  Schematic illustrations of the typical LMB (a) and the faradaic membrane-containing LMB (b), respectively, and the charge–discharge curves of a Li‖LiF–LiCl–LiI‖Sb–Pb LMB operating at 450 °C with different current densities (c)12 and a Li–Pb‖PbCl2 FM-containing LMB with a discharging current density of 150 mA cm−2 at 410 °C (d),54 respectively. 
In 2018, Yin H. et al. proposed a faradaic membrane-containing liquid metal battery that is notably different from ordinary LMBs or ZEBRA-type batteries.54 In such a FM-containing LMB, Li–Pb or Li–Bi alloys have been used as negative electrodes, with Li serving as the active metal and Pb or Bi functioning as the host metal to restrict the Li-concentration and hinder the formation of pure Li or the solid intermetallic compound Li–Pb on the bottom surface of the faradaic membrane. The positive active material is PbCl2 dissolved in a eutectic LiCl–NaCl molten salt electrolyte that may be electrochemically reduced to liquid Pb at the bottom of the faradaic membrane during charging, resulting in droplets that fall onto the liquid Pb positive electrode at the bottom of the battery, as shown in Fig. 5b. The porous TiN membrane acts as a faradaic membrane, allowing Cl− and Li+ ions to pass through while Pb2+ ions are electrodeposited on the bottom, ensuring physical separation of the two cell compartments. The use of a porous faradaic membrane allows metal halides dissolved in molten salt electrolytes to be employed as positive active materials, violating the rule that only solid insoluble metal halides contained on the conductive skeleton may be used as positive active materials in ZEBAR-type batteries. As shown in Fig. 5b, the faradaic membrane-containing Li–Pb‖PbCl2 liquid metal battery has a nominal voltage of ∼1.3 V, a coulombic efficiency of 92% and a round-trip energy efficiency of 71% with a discharging current density of 150 mA cm−2 at 410 °C, and the high discharge voltage is due to the high potential of Pb/PbCl2vs. Li (2.31 V at 410 °C).
3. Molten salts and solid electrolyte membranes
3.1. Molten salt electrolytes
The molten salt electrolyte's primary roles in HT-MSBs are to conduct ions and separate negative and positive active materials. Molten salts are suitable high-temperature electrolytes with ultra-high ionic conductivities that are nearly two orders of magnitude greater than aqueous electrolyte systems.66 Furthermore, by altering the eutectic molten salt composition, molten salt electrolytes may conduct different types of ions. For example, KCl–LiCl–LiOH and Li0.87Na0.63K0.50CO3–LiOH eutectics can conduct oxygen anions,84,211 but MgCl2–KCl–NaCl and LiF–LiCl–LiI eutectics can conduct metal cations.12,70 The former molten salt electrolytes transport oxygen anions, ensuring effective charge transfer at the electrode–molten salt electrolyte interfaces, decreasing polarization loss and accelerating reversible redox processes in MABs. The latter molten salt electrolytes transport metal cations, ensuring a decreased ohmic impedance loss in LMBs due to the extraordinarily high charge transfer efficiency between liquid metal electrodes and the molten salt electrolyte. Such incredible ionic conductivities are responsible for the ultra-fast charge transfer kinetics at the electrode-molten salt electrolyte interfaces.
However, high-temperature molten salts can dissolve the electrode active materials (i.e. metals and halides) resulting in the formation of electron localization as well as intermediate states or polycompound aggregates.224,225 Electron localization causes low-concentration localized electrons in metal-molten salt solutions, generating significant electronic conductivity in molten salts. Charge transfer during the electron excitation from one metal ion to a nearby metal ion with a higher oxidation state can produce electron channels in polyvalent metal compound-molten salt solutions. Localized electrons in metal-molten salt solutions and electron channels in polyvalent metal compound-molten salt solutions are both detrimental to HT-MSBs, resulting in significant coulombic efficiency loss or, in the worst-case scenario, an internal short circuit. Furthermore, dissolving electrode materials in molten salt electrolytes often causes irreversible migration of the active chemicals in the battery, triggering self-discharge and ultimately degrading battery capacity.226 Because of the high solubility of molten salt electrolytes, the electrode material selection is strictly constrained, and many high-performance metal or oxide electrode materials cannot be employed directly in HT-MSBs.
In contrast, the high solubility of molten salt electrolytes can be exploited to increase the performance of HT-MSBs in the presence of solid electrolyte membranes. When protected by solid electrolyte membranes, molten salt electrolytes can fully exploit the advantages of high solubility by dissolving active electrode materials to produce catholytes or anolytes, significantly improving the mass transfer process on the electrode surface, accelerating the electrode reaction rate and improving current density during battery charge and discharge. When using Li2CO3 as the molten salt electrolyte, the mechanism on the surface of the negative electrode is a dissolve-deposition process of an electrochemical redox reaction because the active material Fe2O3 can be dissolved in molten Li2CO3,52 whereas when using eutectic K2CO3–Na2CO3 as the molten salt electrolyte, the mechanism is a solid-state electrochemical redox reaction because the active material Fe2O3 cannot be dissolved in molten K2CO3–Na2CO3.53 The mass transfer in the dissolve-deposition process is substantially larger than in the solid-state redox process, corresponding to faster electrochemical reaction kinetics on the surface of the negative electrode and higher current densities for battery charge and discharge.
3.2. Solid electrolyte membranes
The solubility of molten salt electrolytes and the ensuing electron conduction are hazardous to the battery performance, and its volatility and fluidity are unfavorable to battery safety and stability. The zebra type battery's approach of employing a solid electrolyte membrane is a successful solution to address these concerns.52,53,81 Using a solid electrolyte membrane can effectively screen the electron conduction, inhibit the adverse effects caused by the dissolution of active substances, and constrain the volatilization and flow of the molten salt electrolyte to a certain extent. Conversely, the use of a solid electrolyte membrane can also fully exploit the advantages of dissolution and mass transfer of the molten salt electrolyte, so as to promote the mass and charge transfer on the surface of the electrode and improve the battery performance.
On the other hand, molten salt electrolytes are typical high-temperature fluids with distinct volatility and fluidity characteristics that are prone to electrolyte loss and leakage, greatly impairing the battery performance and lowering the battery safety and stability.12,54 Molten salt electrolyte based batteries have been restricted to the realm of stationary energy storage due to the volatility and fluidity of molten salt electrolytes, making them difficult to apply as moveable energy storage devices for cars, aircrafts, and marine transport. The use of a solid electrolyte membrane can not only increase the overall strength of the batteries, but also restrict the volatilization and flow of high-temperature molten salt electrolytes. Furthermore, the usage of a solid electrolyte membrane can aid in the optimization of the battery structure and the construction of the electrode/electrolyte interface in HT-MSBs. In open-structured MABs, molten salt electrolytes are required to be exposed to oxygen or an air flow to form a gas–liquid–solid TPI with the positive electrode, resulting in significant electrolyte loss and intense corrosion of the positive electrodes. Corrosion-induced impure ions can be doped into the molten salt electrolyte, weakening electronic insulation and leading to battery self-discharge.200,227 The introduction of a solid electrolyte membrane substitutes a gas–solid–solid TPI for the initial gas-liquid-solid TPI (Fig. 4b), increasing the TPI length of the positive electrode, avoiding molten salt electrolyte exposure in the air flow, isolating the positive electrode from the molten salt electrolyte, and thus significantly reducing molten salt electrolyte loss, inhibiting battery self-discharge, and improving battery performance.
Improving the conductivity of solid electrolytes is vital to battery performance.228 It has been shown that raising the pressure and sintering temperature can greatly reduce the number of grain boundaries in crystalline solid electrolytes, thus improving solid electrolyte ionic conductivity.59 Doping is an effective method for enhancing the ionic conductivity of a solid electrolyte membrane by decreasing grain boundary resistance. Many metal oxides, such as MgO, TiO2, Nb2O5, CaO, NiO, MnO2, Fe2O3, Y2O3, and SiO2, have been utilized as dopants in β-alumina for tuning the properties such as sintering temperature, density, microstructure, mechanics and electronics.44,121 Many cations such as Sr+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Ga3+ and Ta5+ have been mono-, dual-, and ternary-doped in the garnet-type electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) to improve ionic conductivity by microstructure densification and increased Li+ occupancy.229–232 Al2O3 has also been employed as a dopant to improve the densification of LLZO, which aids in the suppression of lithium dendrite formation during the lithium deposition process.233 Doping fluorine anions can boost the ionic conductivity of garnet-type solid electrolyte Li6.25Ga0.25La3Zr2O12 through a favorable Li+ diffusion channel formed by partial substitution of O atoms with F atoms.234
4. Effects of high temperature
High temperature is the most distinguish feature of HT-MSBs from ordinary room-temperature rechargeable batteries, offering unique advantages in large-scale energy storage as compared to room-temperature rechargeable batteries. First, high temperature not only allows low-cost inorganic salts such as halides and carbonates to serve as molten electrolytes, but also activates earth-abundant transition metals as electrode materials, lowering the material cost of HT-MSBs dramatically.199 Second, high temperature can activate electrode materials and accelerate electrochemical reaction kinetics, increase mass transfer and charge transport on the electrode surface, and hence improve the battery performance such as reversibility, capacity and rate. Furthermore, high temperature provides an isolating environment for HT-MSBs, reducing impacts from ambient conditions and affording a direct mechanism to terminate battery operation during emergency cases, and thus boosting operating safety. Though maintenance costs and radiant heat loss should be considered, such temperature management is easy to keep the entire system steady and eliminate unpredictable factors. More importantly, high temperature is the key to HT-MSBs participating in an integrated energy system. HT-MSBs are particular high-temperature energy storage devices incorporating heat and electricity and can be used in conjunction with other high-temperature energy conversion technologies such as MS-TES and high-temperature electrolysis for high-efficiency energy utilization. Due to these properties, HT-MSBs have great potential for large-scale energy storage and future integrated energy systems.
The integrated energy system involves the coordination and optimization of energy generation, conversion, storage and transmission, in order to form an integrated and diversified system of energy production, supply and consumption with the maximum utilization of renewable energy. The integrated energy system can significantly reduce costs, improve energy efficiency, and improve environmental compatibility by integrating multiple energy production, storage, and conversion technologies.21,235,236 It is critical for achieving carbon neutrality, improving grid flexibility, and promoting renewable energy technologies. HT-MSBs can be utilized as the hub in an integrated energy system, combining and adjusting thermal and electric energy to provide efficient electric power storage and release. As shown in Fig. 6, photovoltaic, wind, and nuclear electricity can be generated and stored in HT-MSBs before being transmitted to the power grid, while photothermal and nuclear heat can be stored in molten salt heat storage units to provide heat for HT-MSBs. Furthermore, HT-MSBs and molten salt heat storage units can also provide electricity and heat for HTSE to produce chemical fuels. According to the battery's operating temperature, NAS, ZEBRA, Na-MH, and SELL batteries can match low-temperature heat sources, and LMBs and MABs can match medium- and high-temperature heat sources Fig. 10.

5. Challenges and outlook
High-temperature batteries require electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and electrical resistance. The use of molten salts in combination with solid electrolyte membranes can boost ion conduction selectivity while decreasing electronic conduction. The electrical resistance in the molten salt electrolyte is prone to decrease in HT-MSBs due to the dissolution of electrode materials, while the poor contact between the solid electrolyte and liquid/solid metal electrodes in the solid electrolyte-based high-temperature battery severely affects ion conduction and mass transfer and results in local overheating and breakage of solid electrolyte membranes. Adopting a molten salt in conjunction with a solid electrolyte can complement each other and address the shortage of using one electrolyte material alone. Molten salt electrolytes can significantly increase the contact between the solid electrolyte and electrodes, facilitating charge conduction and mass transfer on the electrode surface and therefore boosting the electrochemical reaction kinetics. The molten salt can also safeguard the battery against overcharge and overdischarge, and the rupture of the solid electrolyte membrane by rationally designing the components. Solid electrolyte membranes, on the other hand, can significantly reduce the coulombic efficiency loss and the battery self-discharge by blocking electron conduction inside the battery. Moreover, the solubility of molten salt electrolytes can enhance the battery performance under the protection of solid electrolyte membranes because it is able to greatly accelerate mass transfer on the electrode surface and boost electrochemical reaction kinetics. Compared with ordinary HT-MSBs, the high-temperature battery with the use of both a molten salt and a solid electrolyte membrane exhibits superior battery performance, particularly in terms of safety and stability.
However, the interaction between the molten salt and solid electrolyte should be considered in solid electrolyte membrane-containing HT-MSBs. Molten salt corrosion would dramatically destroy the structure of solid electrolyte membranes, resulting in ion conductivity decline and membrane fracture. In YSZ-containing MABs, the YSZ membrane can be corroded by molten salt electrolytes via a degradation process of yttrium depletion from the zirconia lattice, leading the YSZ membrane to become loose and eventually broken. Although acidic additions such as CeO2, In2O3, and Sc2O3 can increase the durability of the YSZ membrane in molten salts during the electrochemical process,237 it is difficult to tackle the corrosion problem fundamentally. In ZEBRA and Na-MH batteries, transition metal ions dissolved in molten salt electrolytes are poisonous to the BASE membrane, resulting in decreased sodium-ion conduction and membrane fracture.177,178 Tuning the components of molten salts can reduce metal ion dissolution and alleviate the corrosion of the BASE membrane. Nevertheless, molten salt corrosion is the key barrier to the future development of solid electrolyte membrane-containing HT-MSBs for long-term and large-scale energy storage.
Lowering the operating temperature is an effective way to alleviate molten salt corrosion, and it also contributes to the expansion of available sealing materials. However, lowering the operating temperature would significantly decrease the ion conductivity of both molten salts and solid electrolytes, resulting in the decrease of battery performance.161 Given that molten salt corrosion is caused by the interaction between the molten salt and solid electrolyte membrane, there are three promising material design solutions for protecting the solid electrolyte membrane against molten salt corrosion. (1) Tuning the composition of molten salts. In YSZ-containing MABs, adding Y2O3 in the molten salt electrolyte is conceivable to inhibit the extraction of the stabilizer Y2O3 in YSZ membranes based on the principle of chemical equilibrium by considering that extracting Y2O3 from the YSZ membrane is the corrosion mechanism. (2) Customizing the components of solid electrolyte membranes. In YSZ-containing MABs, the extraction of the stabilizer Y2O3 from the YSZ membrane results from the dissolution of Y2O3 in the molten salt electrolyte. Therefore, substituting low dissolution stabilizers such as CaO and MgO for Y2O3 can enhance the corrosion resistance of ZrO2-based solid electrolyte membranes. (3) Depositing a protective layer on the solid electrolyte membrane. Without affecting the ion conduction of the solid electrolyte membrane, depositing a protective layer at the interface between the solid electrolyte and molten salt can effectively resist the molten salt corrosion of the solid electrolyte. For example, coating a thin CeO2 film on the YSZ membrane can avoid direct contact with molten salt electrolytes and hence avoid Y2O3 extraction.238
High-temperature batteries offer enormous promise for large-scale energy storage due to low material cost, rapid electrochemical reaction, fast charge conduction and mass transfer, and independent operating stability. Because high-temperature batteries involve both electricity and heat, they can play a unique pivotal role in future multi-energy complementary integrated energy systems. The electrolyte materials of both molten salts and solid electrolytes in high-temperature batteries have advantages and disadvantages, but when used together, they can fully exploit their individual advantages and compensate for their deficiencies. Solid electrolyte membranes have emerged in several forms of HT-MSBs, such as liquid sodium/lithium batteries and MABs, to improve the battery performance. Although there is still much room for structural optimization and performance enhancement in these SEM-containing HT-MSBs, and many challenges such as strengthening solid electrolyte ionic conductivity and durability from molten salt corrosion have not been completely addressed, the advantages of high-temperature batteries indicate that they have a great prospect. It is expected that developing high-performance solid electrolytes for conducting diverse ions, high ion conductivity, and high stability in molten salts can considerably enrich the types of SEM-containing HT-MSBs and increase the practicability, safety, and reliability of high-temperature batteries serving for multi-energy complementing integrated energy systems.
