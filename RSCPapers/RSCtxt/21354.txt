    First published on 25th July 2018AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as ultrathin layers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), offer a unique combination of electronic, optical and mechanical properties, and hold potential to enable a host of new device applications spanning from flexible/wearable (opto)electronics to energy-harvesting and sensing technologies. A critical requirement for developing practical and reliable electronic devices based on semiconducting TMDs consists in achieving a full control over their charge-carrier polarity and doping. Inconveniently, such a challenging task cannot be accomplished by means of well-established doping techniques (e.g. ion implantation and diffusion), which unavoidably damage the 2D crystals resulting in degraded device performances. Nowadays, a number of alternatives are being investigated, including various (supra)molecular chemistry approaches relying on the combination of 2D semiconductors with electroactive donor/acceptor molecules. As yet, a large variety of molecular systems have been utilized for functionalizing 2D TMDs via both covalent and non-covalent interactions. Such research endeavours enabled not only the tuning of the charge-carrier doping but also the engineering of the optical, electronic, magnetic, thermal and sensing properties of semiconducting TMDs for specific device applications. Here, we will review the most enlightening recent advancements in experimental (supra)molecular chemistry methods for tailoring the properties of atomically-thin TMDs – in the form of substrate-supported or solution-dispersed nanosheets – and we will discuss the opportunities and the challenges towards the realization of novel hybrid materials and devices based on 2D semiconductors and molecular systems.

1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials represent an ever-growing research area that encompasses multiple disciplines and spans from fundamental science to novel device applications.1–3 Such a terrific endeavour essentially took off in 2004 with the isolation of graphene from graphite via micromechanical cleavage, also known as scotch tape method.4 This simple-yet-effective technique was soon after utilized for the preparation of atomically-thin sheets of various layered van der Waals materials,5 including molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and other transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Unlike graphene that is a semimetal and does not possess a bandgap in its pristine form,6 a property that is essential for application in digital electronic switches,7 the family of layered-TMD materials offers a broad variety of electronic and optical properties, including semiconducting bandgaps in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum.8,9 Bulk TMD crystals were investigated back in the 1960s,10–12 and TMD nanosheets with thickness <100 Å were reported in 1966 by Frindt, who was pioneering the exfoliation of MoS2 by adhesive-tape peeling at that time.13 Noticeably, in 1986 – almost two decades before the advent of graphene and 2D crystals4,5 – Joensen, Frindt and Morrison14 succeeded in preparing single-layer thick sheets of MoS2via ion-intercalation methods.15,16 Nowadays, ultrathin TMDs are among the most popular 2D materials beyond graphene,17,18 with monolayer MoS2 being their prototypical and most investigated element.19 After the demonstration, in 2011, of dual-gated single-layer MoS2 transistors (ref. 20) with excellent Ion/Ioff switching ratio (∼108) and promising field-effect mobility (up to ∼60 cm2 V−1 s−1),21,22 tremendous research efforts have been devoted to exploring the use of 2D-TMD semiconductors – e.g. MoS2, WS2, MoSe2 and WSe2 – as active layers in electronic switches, such as field-effect transistors (FETs).23–26 Thanks to their atomic-scale thicknesses and sizable energy bandgaps (1–3 eV),27 these materials offer ideal electrostatic control in the FET geometry,28,29 and for this reason they have been proposed as potential alternatives to silicon for next-generation More-than-Moore technologies.30,31 The transition from indirect to direct bandgap that occurs when the thickness of the TMDs is scaled down to a single layer,32–34 has also attracted great attention in view of potential applications in optoelectronic devices,26,35–37 in particular photodetectors38–40 and solar cells.41–44 Besides having excellent optical and electronic properties, ultrathin TMDs are also characterized by a high degree of mechanical flexibility, robustness and light weight,45,46 which make them ideal candidates for the fabrication of flexible, foldable and wearable/portable (opto)electronic devices.23,47–49
Though impressive advances have been made in this direction,17,18 numerous scientific and technological challenges still need to be tackled towards the first market products based on 2D semiconductors.1,3,23 In particular (i) the synthesis of large-area and high-quality films of monolayer TMDs with low densities of defects and impurities,16,50 as well as (ii) the development of sound strategies to control the charge-carrier type and the doping level in 2D semiconducting crystals remain major challenges to be faced.1,51–53 Whereas a lot of progress has been reported and reviewed on the synthesis of 2D-TMD sheets,16,50,54–56 seemingly, relatively less work has been focused on the second critical aspect, which is nevertheless a veritable bottleneck to the incorporation of 2D TMDs in (opto)electronic technologies.1,51–53 Achieving a systematic control over charge-carrier doping is essential for minimizing detrimental Schottky barriers at metal–semiconductor interfaces,57 as well as for manufacturing p–n junctions and transistors with reproducible electrical characteristics, which are crucial requirements for the production of complementary-logic devices and circuits.58 Conventional doping techniques, such as ion implantation and dopant diffusion, are extremely challenging to be implemented in combination with 2D TMDs, since damages/defects induced by such processes in ultrathin crystals can have highly-detrimental effects on their structural and electrical characteristics, resulting in degraded device performances.59–61 This is a critical hurdle for the realization of practical and reliable devices that exploit the unique properties of 2D semiconductors. Various alternatives have been proposed – which are comprehensively reviewed in ref. 51 and 53 – such as alloying,62 transition-metal substitution/incorporation,63–66 plasma-assisted doping,67 chalcogen substitution via defect engineering,68,69 as well as charge transfer via interaction with molecular adlayers.25 In particular, the use of molecular systems interfacing 2D semiconducting sheets is emerging as a promising versatile and non-destructive method not only for controlling the charge-carrier doping and polarity of ultrathin TMDs but also for tailoring their optical properties and imparting them novel functionalities. Being essentially all surface, atomically-thin crystals are extremely sensitive to all influences of a surrounding environment, and their properties can thereof be easily modified by external variables.1,70 For instance, FETs based on monolayer TMDs sheets were reported to be highly sensitive to a large number of gas molecules, which interact with the surface of the 2D semiconducting channel modulating its charge-carrier density via electrical dipoles or charge-transfer interactions.71–74 Hence, one can take advantage of the exquisite sensitivity of ultrathin TMDs to tune their electronic and optical properties by controlling the physico-chemical variables of the surrounding environment,25,70,75 for instance by engineering ad hoc (supra)molecular systems interfacing the 2D sheets.70,75
Indeed, a variety of experimental molecular chemistry approaches (see Fig. 1), based on covalent76–80 and non-covalent81–83 interactions between molecules and defective/pristine TMDs, have been reported in the last few years. Such studies enabled not only to tune the charge-carrier doping81,84–90 but also to tailor other functional properties critical for (opto)electronic applications, such as for instance the charge transport,25,64,91–93 the charge injection,94,95 the optical emission and adsorption,96–103 as well as the dispersibility in liquid media (inks),104–106 the latter being crucial for the processing of large-area films and devices.107,108
 Fig. 1  Schematic representation of the different molecular chemistry approaches that have been investigated in the last years for tailoring the properties of 2D TMDs. 
In this review article, we will describe and discuss, from an experimental viewpoint, the molecular chemistry approaches that have been developed so far to functionalize 2D TMDs – in particular the so-called MoWSeS materials (i.e. MoS2, WS2, MoSe2 and WSe2)2 – and to control their charge-carrier doping along with other materials’ characteristics. It is worth noting that such strategies have been implemented both on 2D layers pre-deposited on a substrate (Sections 2–4) and on dispersions of TMD nanosheets in solution (Section 5). More specifically, Section 2 will be focused on non-covalent methods to decorate the top and bottom surfaces of substrate-supported ultrathin TMD crystals with electroactive (i.e. donor and acceptor) molecules, which can be eventually deposited in the form of highly-ordered molecular layers.83 Section 3 will describe the use of defect- and phase-engineering approaches for the chemical functionalization of ultrathin TMD sheets obtained via mechanical exfoliation or chemical vapour deposition (CVD) growth on a suitable substrate.69,80,109 These techniques allow for the covalent binding of molecular species onto the basal-plane of the 2D crystals. In Section 4, we will present some newly emerging chemical methods – at the borderline between covalent and non-covalent chemistry – that can be employed to control and optimize optical processes in substrate-supported 2D semiconductors, e.g. the photoluminescence emission in direct-bandgap monolayer TMDs.
Research endeavours have also been devoted to the development of liquid-phase methods for tailoring the properties of semiconducting nanosheets dispersed in aqueous or organic solutions with a number of molecules and (bio) polymers.110–112 The availability of inks of functionalized TMDs is expected to open up novel possibilities for the processing of large-area hybrid materials and devices – e.g. by making use of ink-jet printing methods106 – based on combinations of 2D semiconductors and molecular systems. In this framework, Section 5 will provide an overview of the liquid-phase functionalization strategies highlighting the nature of the chemical interactions (covalent or non-covalent) between molecules and TMD nanosheets. Due to their broader commercial availability and well-established exfoliation processes, MoWSeS materials are the most investigated among the TMD class, and for this reason they also represent the main focus of this review article.9 On the other hand, only a few experimental and theoretical studies exist on the effects of functional molecules on the (opto)electronic properties of other TMD materials (e.g. group-10 PdSe2 and group-5 NbSe2),113,114 which have been grouped and reviewed all together in Section 6.
Molecular-design strategies can be used to “bridge” a virtually-infinite number of molecules to 2D crystals (Section 1.2), providing unique opportunities not only to modulate the properties of ultrathin TMDs on demand for specific device applications but also to introduce new functionalities with the aim of developing novel multifunctional/multiresponsive materials and devices. These opportunities and the associated challenges will be discussed in the last part of this review (Section 7).
1.1 Materials and properties
Single sheets of TMDs, commonly indicated with the formula MX2, consist of an atomic layer of transition metals (M = Mo, W, Ti, Nb, Ta, Re, Pt, Pd etc.) sandwiched between two atomic layers of chalcogens (X = S, Se and Te).11,115 More than 40 bulk MoX2 crystals – resulting from different permutations of M and X elements – are available in nature, and most of them possess a layered structure.26,115 In such layered materials, the atoms within individual sheets are connected via strong covalent bonds (1–10 eV per atom), whereas adjacent sheets interact with each other through weak van der Waals forces (10s of meV per atom).1,2,115 For this reason, similarly to graphite and other layered materials,116 TMDs can be easily exfoliated into single- and few-layer thick nanosheets by making use of various exfoliation techniques, including micromechanical cleavage via scotch-tape peeling,5,13 as well as liquid-phase methods based on intercalation of ions (chemical exfoliation),117–121 ultrasonication/shear exfoliation in organic solvents122,123 or aqueous surfactant solutions.105 Nowadays, graphene is not the only 2D material to be available in the form of high-quality large-area films produced via chemical vapour deposition (CVD) growth.124,125 In fact, ultrathin films of MoWSeS materials50,54,126–128 and other TMDs (e.g. ReS2129 and SnSe2130) can also be grown by CVD methods on technologically-relevant substrates (e.g. oxidized Si wafers), and lateral heterostructure of different 2D semiconductors, which are promising for next-generation (opto)electronic devices, have already been reported in the literature.131,132
Nowadays, ultrathin TMDs are intensively investigated for applications in electronic switches, p–n junctions, logic gates and optoelectronic devices.23,27,35 In fact, several high-quality semiconducting TMDs are currently available with various electronic properties, as well with different charge-transport polarity. For instance, ultrathin MoS2 behaves as a unipolar n-type semiconductor, whereas 2D WSe2 commonly displays ambipolarity.27

Crystal structures. 
TMDs can have multiple crystal structures, depending on the mutual coordination of the M and X elements,115,133 and transitions between different phases have been predicted134 and triggered experimentally via multiple physico-chemical stimuli.135 The most common polytypes (see Fig. 2) are the hexagonal – normally indicated as 1H for single layers and 2H for multilayers – with trigonal prismatic (D3h) coordination, and the tetragonal 1T with octahedral coordination (Oh).115,133 The 1T polytype often undergoes a lattice distortion into a 1T′ form, as for instance in the case of MoTe2.136,137 For monolayer MoWSeS, the most stable polytype is 1H, which is associated with semiconducting properties and direct bandgaps.8,138,139 However, metastable 1T/1T′ polytypes with metallic characteristics can be prepared with various methodologies.135 In 1991, Sandoval et al.140 demonstrated that monolayer MoS2 sheets produced via lithium-ion intercalation have octahedral phase, and they also proposed a possible 1T′ distorted configuration. Such results were confirmed by a number of subsequent studies (e.g.ref. 121 and 141–143) and possible strategies for prompting transitions between the metallic 1T/1T′ and the semiconducting 1H phases have been proposed. In 2011, Eda et al.142 reported on photoluminescence emission – typical of 1H semiconductors – from MoS2 nanosheets produced via lithium-ion intercalation. The key to this achievement was the 1T/1T′ → 1H conversion triggered by thermal annealing (T ≥ 300 °C) after deposition on a substrate.142 This work stimulated the investigation of phase-engineering techniques for modulating the properties of ultrathin TMDs, which can be conveniently utilized in combination with molecular chemistry approaches,77,80 as discussed in Section 3. The properties and the stability of different polytypes in TMDs “beyond MoWSeS” can vary significantly, depending on the d-electron number of the transition metal (see Section 6).9,130,131 For example, monolayer PtSe2 (group 10) is a 2D semiconductor with indirect bandgap of ∼1.2 eV (theory)138,139 and 1T stable polytype;144 NbSe2 nanosheets (group 4) have stable 1H/2H metallic phase and were shown to maintain superconducting characteristics down to the monolayer thickness;145 single-layer MoTe2 (group 6) displays a 1T′ semimetallic polytype that is almost as stable as its 1H counterpart,146,147 whereas ultrathin ReS2 (group 7) presents a distorted semiconducting 1T′ structure with diamond-shape lines that are responsible for strongly anisotropic transport properties.148,149 Here, we will not enter into the details of such a wealth of structures and properties, which have been thoroughly presented elsewhere (e.g.ref. 9, 27, 115 and 150). However, we point out that the physico-chemical properties of ultrathin TMDs, as well as their interactions with their surroundings, can vary dramatically with the 2D-material structural phase,80 and such variability cannot be overlooked when dealing with molecular chemistry methods for the functionalization of ultrathin TMDs.

Defects. 
Another important aspect to consider is the fact that materials, in general, have defects. Though often regarded as detrimental and undesired due to the fact that they perturb the peculiar material's properties, defects have also been exploited for introducing novel functionalities in (opto)electronic devices,151,152 and are being regarded as chemically-active sites suitable for the chemical functionalization of 2D materials, among which graphene153 and ultrathin TMDs.79,88 In the case of exfoliated 2D sheets, topological and structural defects can be inherited from the source bulk crystals, and they can also be generated during the exfoliation process.154,155 In CVD films, the synthesis/growth leads not only to point defects, but also to grain boundaries (GBs), which affect the charge-transport properties in 2D electronic devices.56,156 Also in this context, MoS2 is the most studied among the TMD crystals.69 Its defects and their influences on various physical properties have been extensively investigated, both experimentally157–167 and theoretically.165,168–174 In comparison, a relatively smaller number of works have focused on other TMDs.172,175–180
Vacancies are a common type of point defects in ultrathin TMD samples and have been found in multiple forms – e.g. single or double, M or X vacancies – as recently reviewed by Lin et al.69 In the case of MoS2 monolayers prepared by micromechanical cleavage, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were reported in 2013 by Qiu et al.,157 who showed that sulfur vacancies (SVs) – see Fig. 2c and d – are the most abundant type of defects in exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets, and can reach densities of the order of ∼1013 cm−2, corresponding to approximately 10 SV over an area of 10 × 10 nm2. Two years later, Hong et al.,164 carried out a systematic TEM investigation and acquired statistical information on the quantities/types of defects in various MoS2 samples. In agreement with the previous work,157 they found that single SVs (VS1) can achieve concentrations as high as 1.2 × 1013 cm−2 in both mechanically-exfoliated and CVD-grown MoS2 monolayers. Noticeably, double SVs (VS2) were found to be present mainly in exfoliated nanosheets with densities in the range of ∼1012 cm−2.164 The landscape of defects/disorder in CVD monolayer MoS2 can be more complex.158 Besides the most abundant SVs, there are also GBs, dislocations, as well as different types of point defects, such as vacancies of Mo–S complexes and antisite defects.69,158
The variety and abundance of defects in MoS2 and other TMDs is being regarded as a major problem to the implementation of practical and reliable (opto)electronic devices based on 2D semiconductors. However, defects can also be exploited to advantage for the chemical functionalization of the ultrathin nanosheets. In fact, whereas the basal plane of pristine 2D TMDs lacks of dangling bonds and therefore is rather chemically inert, defect-rich surfaces allow for different chemical reactions to occur, as in the case of SV-containing MoS2.109,181–186 It is worth noting that the edges of TMD crystals are also highly chemically reactive and have been widely investigated because of their excellent catalytic properties.187–191 Moreover, chalcogen- and metal-rich edges are being regarded as suitable targets for the chemical functionalization of liquid-phase exfoliated nanosheets (see Section 5),192–196 enabling the production of functional TMD inks for (opto)electronic197 as well as biomedical applications.198
In the last few years, several defect-engineering strategies have been developed for tailoring the physico-chemical properties of 2D TMDs,69 opening new routes for the functionalization of TMDs via molecular chemistry methods (Section 3.1).

1.2 “Bridging” ultrathin TMDs with molecular systems
Numerous advantages arise from the functionalization of ultrathin TMDs with molecular systems. Besides offering unique opportunities for tailoring the electrical, optical, thermal and sensing properties of TMDs, such a combination makes it also possible to develop novel multifunctional/multiresponsive hybrid materials and devices suitable for advanced logic, memory and sensing applications.199 Indeed, functionalization methods aiming at “bridging” these two worlds have been intensively investigated over the past few years.76,111,198,200 In particular, molecular chemistry offers a variety of techniques to achieve this objective, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The simplest technique is based on the physisorption of electroactive molecules on substrate-supported nanosheets, which can be achieved via solution-processing (e.g.ref. 87 and 201) or vapour-phase (e.g.ref. 202) deposition. A more elaborated approach consists in the use of the principles of supramolecular chemistry to control the ordering of molecules via self-assembly.83,203 Highly-ordered crystalline assemblies of physisorbed molecules can be grown on 2D materials by drop casting or spin coating,93,203 resulting in spatially uniform periodic interactions between the 2D sheets and the molecular adlayers.93 In addition, the packing and orientation of the molecules can be engineered ad hoc for modulating the magnitude/direction of surface dipoles, as well as the charge transfer between the molecular layers and the 2D crystals.93 This represents an intriguing opportunity for tuning the charge-carrier doping in ultrathin TMDs, eventually by bringing into play cooperativity or collective processes.204 A slightly different technique involves the preparation of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) via molecular chemisorption on suitable substrates, followed by the deposition/transfer of the 2D sheets (e.g.ref. 84 and 92). More in general, the electronic and optical properties of TMDs can be tailored by controlling the substrate surface chemistry, which can be accomplished with multiple approaches, including the use of polymer coating layers.205,206
In all the cases discussed above, the functionalization is achieved through non-covalent interactions between the molecules and the 2D sheets. However, it is also possible to “bridge” ultrathin TMDs and molecules via strong and stable covalent bonds, e.g. by exploiting defect and phase-engineering approaches69,207 to activate and harness the chemical reactivity of the TMDs’ surface. For instance, ultrathin layers of MoS2 containing SVs can be “decorated” with molecules bearing nucleophilic functional groups – especially thiols88,109 – that can coordinate/bind to the exposed molybdenum atoms at SV sites.181,183,184 Whereas the semiconducting 1H/2H phase of MoS2 cannot be easily functionalized in the absence of defects,110 its electron-rich 1T/1T′ counterpart allows for numerous functionalization routes,111 since the occurrence of bond-forming reactions is facilitated by electron transfer between the metallic sheets and the reactant species (e.g. electrophiles such as organohalides).80 Hence, one can exploit phase-conversion processes in TMDs135 (see Section 1.1) to obtain metallic polytypes suitable for chemical functionalization, and eventually convert them back to their original phase, as demonstrated by Voiry et al.80 Noticeably, all these approaches can be conducted directly in solution – e.g. in the case of liquid-phase exfoliated TMDs (Section 5) – or on substrate-supported sheets, as outlined in detail below.
2. Tuning the properties of substrate-supported TMDs via non-covalent interactions
In conventional semiconductor technology, precise control over the optoelectronic properties of materials can be achieved by substitutional doping, which consists in replacing host atoms of the crystal with dopant impurities.58,151 In high-quality and low-defectiveness ultrathin TMD sheets, doping can be conveniently accomplished by decorating their top and bottom surfaces with electroactive (i.e. donor or acceptor) molecules, which can be used to tune the charge-carrier density via non-covalent interactions with the pristine TMD basal plane. While substitutional doping has also been successfully applied to TMDs,63,65,79,208 the non-covalent molecular approach (i.e. physisorption) has the advantage of leaving the crystal structure of TMDs unaltered, preserving their superior optoelectronic properties.
Two major mechanisms lead to the molecular doping of TMDs, which are (i) charge transfer and (ii) dipolar interactions. Charge transfer occurs when the electrochemical redox potential of the molecules and the Fermi level of 2D materials comply with certain conditions: when the redox potential of a given molecular dopant lies below the Fermi level of the TMD, electron transfer can occur from the TMD sheet to the molecule, resulting in electron depletion (p-type doping);209vice versa, when the redox potential of the molecules lies above the TMD Fermi level, electrons are transferred from the molecules to the TMD, inducing electron accumulation (n-type doping).85Fig. 3 compares the reduction potentials of various molecular dopants with the band edges – namely the electron affinity (conduction band minimum, CBM) and the ionization potential (valence band maximum, VBM) – of group-6 monolayer TMDs.210 Although the exact position of the Fermi level depends on several factors (e.g. impurities, substrate, crystal defects, etc.), the figure provides a guideline for the choice of suitable molecules to realize doping in monolayer TMD sheets based on possible charge-transfer processes involving the CBM/VBM levels of TMDs. It should be noticed that the band edges are characterized by a significant uncertainty; for instance, the electron affinity of 1L MoS2 has been reported to vary from ∼3.9 eV (ref. 211) to ∼4.7 eV (ref. 212).
 Fig. 3  Comparison between the electrochemical redox potentials of various molecular dopants and the band edges of group-6 TMDs. Approximate reduction potentials (eV vs. vacuum) were derived from values reported in literature, namely hydrazine (N2H4),214 benzyl viologen (BV),85 magnesium phthalocyanine (MgPc),99 nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc),99 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH),209 tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ),209 tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ),209 tris(4-bromophenyl)-ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate (Magic Blue).201 The CBM/VBM band edges (theoretical values) were taken from ref. 210. 
Dipolar interactions can also be exploited for tuning the charge-carrier doping in ultrathin TMDs. A molecule with permanent dipole moments generates an electric field on the 2D-sheet surface, which modulates the local charge carrier density similarly to a nanoscopic electric gate. When several molecules lying on the TMD surface possess the same dipole orientation, single-molecule effects can sum up leading to a macroscopic modification of the TMD energetics. In particular, a shift in the Fermi level of semiconducting TMDs was observed as a consequence of the interaction with well-aligned molecular dipoles,84 resulting in p- or n-type doping depending on the dipole direction.86 In most cases, both mechanisms contribute to the doping effect, and it is often difficult to disentangle the two contributions.92
In this section, we will summarize the doping of TMDs through the decoration of their top and bottom surfaces with electroactive molecular systems. As an overview, Table 1 provides a summary of the molecules that have been used in experiments to decorate ultrathin TMDs, highlighting their impact on the optoelectronic (photoluminescence) and vibrational (Raman-active phonons) properties, as well as the mechanism (charge-transfer or dipolar interactions) responsible for the measured effects.

2.1 Physisorption of electroactive molecules
Crystal defects and impurities introduced with conventional doping techniques can significantly affect the electrical characteristics of FETs based on monolayer TMDs, including the field-effect mobility, the threshold voltage and the subthreshold swing.109,223,224 Electronic defect states and charge-carrier scattering mechanisms associated with neutral/ionized impurities and structural defects can be highly detrimental to the charge-transport properties of ultrathin 2D TMDs, as comprehensively reviewed in ref. 225. Moreover, they can degrade the performances of optoelectronic devices in terms of photoresponsivity and light emission.175,226 Charge transfer between physisorbed electroactive molecules and ultrathin sheets is a widely investigated method for tuning the charge-carrier doping in semiconducting TMDs, as discussed previously. One of the most studied molecules is 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ), which is a common electron acceptor (p-dopant).209 The redox potential of F4-TCNQ lies below the CBM of monolayer MoS2 (see Fig. 3) so that electron transfer can occur from the conduction band of heavily n-doped MoS2 – where the Fermi level lies close to the CBM – to the unoccupied energy states of the F4-TCNQ molecules, resulting in electron depletion. The p-doping effect is evident from the evolution of the photoluminescence (PL) spectra upon molecular physisorption (Fig. 4a). The A exciton, which is associated with optical transitions at the K point of the Brillouin zone, consists of both negatively-charged excitons (i.e. trions, E(X−) ≈ 1.84 eV) and neutral excitons (E(X) ≈ 1.88 eV); moreover, the trion spectral weight  depends on the amount of doping in the 2D semiconducting sheet.227 For the as-exfoliated MoS2 on oxidized silicon substrates, the trion intensity was found to be higher than that of the neutral exciton (see fitting results in Fig. 4c) due to the n-type doping typically occurring in natural MoS2 crystals.19 On the other hand, in the F4-TCNQ-doped MoS2 the contribution of the neutral exciton becomes dominant due to electron depletion, the A peak blue shifts and its intensity increases dramatically.

Different from F4-TCNQ, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) has a redox potential higher than the CBM of monolayer MoS2 (see Fig. 3) and therefore can be used for n-type doping. After physisorption of NADH molecules, the PL spectra of monolayer MoS2 (Fig. 4b) are characterized by a higher trion spectral weight. Moreover, the A peak red-shifts and its intensity decreases, due to electron accumulation in the 2D material. This example shows that through the molecular physisorption approach both the charge-carrier doping and the PL emission spectra can be effectively modulated.
Similar results were obtained by Peimyoo et al.216 by making use of monolayer (1L) WS2 sheets in combination with F4-TCNQ molecules. The authors investigated the effects of molecular physisorption on the electrical properties of back gated 1L-WS2 FETs (Fig. 4d). With increasing F4-TCNQ concentration, the threshold voltage was found to shift towards more positive gate-voltage values in line with the occurrence of p-type doping.
Besides PL and charge-transport measurements, Raman spectroscopy is also a versatile tool for studying doping effects in TMDs.228 The two main Raman-active phonon modes of 2H-TMD crystals are A1g and E12g, which correspond to out-of-plane vibrations of chalcogen atoms and in-plane vibrations of chalcogen and transition metal atoms, respectively.229 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and symmetry arguments predict that for MoS2, the A1g phonon mode is more sensitive to the electron doping than the E12g due to a stronger electron–phonon coupling in the out-of-plane A1g vibration.228 For additional information on anharmonic effects in pristine 2D TMD lattices we refer the reader to ref. 230 and 231.
The Raman spectra of few-layer MoS2 sheets were measured after “decoration” with n-type and p-type dopant molecules, as illustrated in Fig. 5.87 For the n-type dopant (2-Fc-DMBI)2 – i.e. 2-ferrocenyl N,N′-dimethylbenzimidazoline radical, inset of Fig. 5b – the A1g peak of MoS2 red-shifts by ∼1 cm−1 and the peak broadens (ΔFWHM ≈ 1.4 cm−1), whereas the E12g mode remains almost unchanged (Δυ < 0.2 cm−1, Fig. 5b). In contrast, for p-type dopants such as tris(4-bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate (“Magic Blue”, Fig. 5d) both A1g and E12g peak blue-shift (Δυ ≈ 0.5 cm−1) and the peak sharpens (ΔFWHM ≈ −0.4 cm−1). The effects of molecular physisorption doping on the Raman spectra of MoS2 nanosheets are similar to those induced by electrostatic gating in FET structures.228 With the increasing gate voltage (electron accumulation), the A1g peak red-shifts and the peak broadens. This demonstrates that molecular physisorption influences the phonon vibrations by modifying electron–phonon interactions. Furthermore, the shift of the A1g Raman peak is proportional to the doping concentration,228 which is quite useful to probe the doping level in TMDs.

Numerous molecules have been exploited to tune the properties of TMDs.25,36 Among these, we discuss a class of metallophthalocyanine molecules – indicated as MPc, where M is the metal centre (e.g. NaPc, MgPc, TiPc, FePc, NiPc, CuPc, PtPc, etc.) – which are currently attracting attention for doping TMDs due to their metal-centre dependent redox potential.99 A schematic illustration of a MPc molecule physisorbed on a TMD sheet is provided in Fig. 6a. The planar structure of π-conjugated rings results in a flat-lying MPc/TMD configuration. Based on the positions of the band edges of TMDs with respect to the redox potential of MPcs, it is possible to predict the direction of the charge transfer between the TMDs and the MPc molecules.99 For example, the redox potential of NiPc (MgPc) is located below (above) the CBM of MoSe2 (Fig. 3). Upon light irradiation, photo-excited electrons in the conduction band of MoSe2 can transfer to NiPc molecules, which provide a non-radiative recombination pathway that severely degrades the PL quantum yield of monolayer MoSe2 (Fig. 6b). In contrast, no significant changes can be observed in the PL spectra of MgPc-treated MoSe2 (Fig. 6c).99 Physisorbed MPc molecules can be effectively used for tuning the charge-carrier density in ultrathin TMD sheets. For instance, NaPc induces n-type doping in MoS2 whereas FePc and CuPc result in p-type doping.89 Interestingly, the charge-carrier density in hybrid MPc/TMD systems depends on the work function of the MPc metal centre, which can therefore be chosen ad hoc for achieving the desired level of doping. It is worth noting that MPc/MoS2 FETs were found to be stable for at least two weeks after doping, despite the lack of any encapsulation layer. Finally, physisorbed MPc molecules have been investigated for passivating electronic defects, as well as for engineering surface states in defective monolayer MoS2.217

The effects of organic dyes on the optoelectronic properties of TMDs were recently explored.218,232 In particular, perylenediimides and tetraphenyl porphyrins allowed increasing the conductivity of bottom-contact back-gate photodetectors based on relatively thick MoS2 sheets (approximately 10 layers).218 Such an increase was ascribed to the n-type doping induced by physisorbed molecules.
All these results demonstrate the possibility to control the charge-carrier doping in TMDs by molecular physisorption. However, further research is required to improve the stability of the charge transport properties in hybrid TMD-molecule systems, e.g. by developing suitable encapsulation techniques to prevent desorption or eventual decomposition of molecules during device operation and storage. Indeed, solving this critical challenge is mandatory for developing practical (opto)electronic devices based on TMDs and weakly bound physisorbed molecules. Towards this goal, novel approaches are being explored. As an example, Yu et al.215 reported on the use of mixtures of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and F4-TCNQ, which enabled simultaneously the effective encapsulation and doping of few-layer WSe2 FETs.
2.2 Molecular engineering of the top and bottom TMD surface
In this section, we discuss how molecular “decoration” allows for tuning the properties of TMDs in the absence of strong covalent interactions and significant charge transfer. When organized in continuous and homogeneous layers, molecules can modify the TMD (opto)electronic properties not only via charge transfer but also by acting as passivating/encapsulating agents233 or by interacting through (ordered) dipolar fields.39
The bottom TMD surface has been modified via engineering of the substrate surface chemistry, namely by inserting polymers or self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) between the substrate and the TMD layer. Instead, the top TMD surface has been “decorated” with highly ordered physisorbed layers composed of functional molecules. We point out that molecular ordering at the nanoscale determines the overall interaction between the molecules and 2D sheet. Precise control over the molecular arrangement can thereof be exploited to finely tune the TMD optoelectronic properties. In this regard, the electrical and optical characterization of TMD/molecules systems should be ideally complemented by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) investigations, which offer the possibility to explore molecular adsorption with sub-molecular resolution.234–237 Indeed, STM could provide precious information on the molecular-scale mechanisms leading to macroscopic effects, which is useful not only to optimize the nanoscale molecular assembly but also to assist chemists in the design of molecular units exhibiting the desired cooperative or collective effects.204 This possibility will be discussed in more detail in the conclusion section.

TMDs on polymers and functional SAMs. 
Polymers have often been employed as dielectric substrates for TMDs,205,206,238–240 in view of their mechanical flexibility that makes them compatible with bendable and stretchable electronics.47,241,242 As compared to conventional SiO2, dielectric polymer films can be remarkably different in terms of surface roughness, dielectric permittivity and phonon vibrations.205,243,244 Molecular design can be exploited to tailor the physico-chemical properties of polymeric surfaces, e.g. through the tuning of the surface energy.245 Hereafter, we present a few examples in which the use of polymer-modified substrates results in a significant improvement of the (opto)electronic properties of TMDs.

Fig. 7a displays the general scheme of a typical FET based on TMD sheets deposited onto a dielectric polymer substrate. By using this architecture, Chamlagain et al.205 demonstrated that the room-temperature field-effect mobility of multilayer (5–15 nm thick) MoSe2 FETs on parylene (100–150 cm V−1 s−1) is systematically higher than in the case of equivalent devices on SiO2 (∼50 cm V−1 s−1, Fig. 7b). The authors attributed such substrate dependent mobility to charge-carrier scattering induced by phonon vibrations at the SiO2 and parylene surfaces. In particular, the scattering with polar optical phonons originating from the substrate limits the mobility of MoSe2 on SiO2, while it is nearly absent in the case of MoSe2 on parylene.205 Alternative explanations for the measured effects include the polymer-mediated passivation of charged impurities on the SiO2 surface and the high roughness of the polymer film, which could be favourable for the removal of adsorbate molecules trapped below the TMD sheet during vacuum annealing procedures. Similarly, the electronic performances of multilayer MoS2 on PMMA were found to be higher than those on SiO2. Remarkably, in the case of MoS2 on PMMA not only high n-type mobility was measured (up to ∼470 cm2 V−1 s−1) but also p-type mobility (up to ∼480 cm2 V−1 s−1), resulting in almost ideal ambipolar characteristics. The different electronic behavior of MoS2 on SiO2 and PMMA was attributed to short range disorder at the TMD/SiO2 interface (e.g. chemical bonding and surface roughness).239

In a recent study, Liu et al.206 found that the PL spectrum of MoS2 onto the fluoropolymer CYTOP closely resembles that of self-standing MoS2 with a narrow and strong A exciton peak with negligible trion contribution (Fig. 7c). A similar effect was observed for WS2.206 FETs fabricated on MoS2 monolayers on CYTOP also showed lower intrinsic n-type doping and higher mobility than those fabricated on SiO2. In view of these results, the authors concluded that CYTOP is an ideal substrate for TMDs, on account of its very low surface energy, low surface trap densities and low permittivity. By taking full advantage of the polymeric substrate, the authors demonstrate a giant bandgap renormalization in back-gated MoS2 and WS2, which manifests itself as a sizeable gate-induced modulation of PL and differential reflectance (Fig. 7d).206
These examples show how TMD/substrate interactions, which remarkably influence the charge-transport properties of TMDs,246 can be tuned by making use of polymeric substrates, thereby offering a valuable strategy to engineer TMD-based devices.
Similarly, the physico-chemical properties of the substrate can be tailored by using functional SAMs.247 The molecules employed to generate such architectures possess (i) an anchoring group that promotes the chemisorption onto the substrate, (ii) a molecular backbone that stabilizes the packing via side-to-side molecular interactions, and (iii) a functional headgroup that ultimately determines the physico-chemical characteristics of the exposed surface.248 TMDs can be deposited onto SAM-modified substrates (e.g.Fig. 8a) and they display different properties depending on the molecular headgroups in the SAM. We point out that while SAMs are covalently bound to the substrate, TMD sheets are physisorbed onto SAMs and their interaction is mediated by relatively weak van der Waals forces. Crucially, non-covalent interactions among adjacent molecules forming the SAM endow high crystalline order with molecules oriented edge-on with respect to the substrate plane.247 In this way, the ordered nanoscale arrangement ensures that single-molecule dipoles sum up, collectively generating significant electric fields. Therefore, when TMDs are exfoliated onto SAM-decorated substrates, they experience an electric field effect analogous to that generated by a constant non-zero gate voltage. As a result, highly ordered SAMs of highly dipolar molecules can introduce remarkable shifts in the Fermi level of TMDs,84 resulting in doping effects that are mediated by purely electrostatic interaction, even in the absence of significant charge transfer. The two doping mechanisms – i.e. charge transfer82,87 or dipolar interactions87,249 – are often concomitant, and it is not always possible to disentangle one from the other.87,92

Experimentally, the possibility to modulate the charge-carrier concentration via SAMs was demonstrated in a study of the optoelectronic characteristics of mechanically-exfoliated MoS2 sheets deposited onto different SAMs.84 The authors modified the SiO2 substrate employing SAMs composed of alkanes exposing an anchoring silane group and different functional headgroups. In particular, SAMs of three silane agents characterized by different dipole moments and polarities were employed: octyltrichlorosilane (OTS, CH3-SAM), 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-1-propanamine (APTES, NH2-SAM), and trichloro-(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (FOTS, CF3-SAM), as shown in Fig. 8a. Water contact angle measurements were carried out to assess the surface energy of the SAMs. The effect of the different molecular dipoles on the optoelectronic properties of MoS2 was investigated by a combination of Raman spectroscopy, FET fabrication and characterization, as well as Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Fig. 8b shows the electrical characterization of FETs based on a few-layers MoS2 fabricated on the different SAMs. The FOTS SAM was found to induce a positive shift of the threshold voltage, i.e. it introduces p-type doping. On the other hand, the APTES SAM was found to introduce a shift of the threshold voltage towards more negative gate-voltage values (n-type doping). Through KPFM, the authors showed that the position of the Fermi level of monolayer MoS2 could be modulated in a range of more than 0.45 eV through the interaction with FOTS and APTES. Finally, minor effects on the threshold voltage were observed for the OTS-treated SiO2 as compared to the bare SiO2 substrate, indicating minor doping.84 These results were explained on the basis of the different orientation of the molecular dipoles, which point towards opposite directions for FOTS and APTES. Instead, the relatively low dipolar moment of CH3-SAM did not induce significant doping on MoS2. Nevertheless, even alkyl SAMs have interesting effects on the optoelectronic properties of TMDs. Recently, Ajayi et al.233 measured an ultranarrow low-temperature PL linewidth in MoSe2 (approaching the intrinsic limit) thanks to an effective substrate passivation achieved via alkyl SAMs. In particular, a 6 meV-wide PL peak was measured for MoSe2 on the alkyl SAM, in contrast to the broader 9 meV peak of MoSe2 on SiO2. Additionally, the presence of the alkyl SAM also affected the optical characteristics of MoSe2 encapsulated in BN (BN/MoSe2/BN), which exhibited broader PL on the bare SiO2 (3 meV) rather than on the SAM-passivated surface (2 meV).
Theoretically, it was predicted that the presence of SAMs exposing a polar headgroup anchored onto metal electrodes could promote the charge injection into MoSe2, converting Schottky metal–semiconductor junctions into nearly Ohmic contacts.95 These studies show how SAM engineering represents a straightforward approach to control the charge-carrier polarity enabling the fabrication of p–n junctions and complementary logic devices.
Taking a step further, a thorough choice of the molecules composing the SAMs makes it possible to confer unique capabilities to TMDs. This possibility was demonstrated by depositing MoS2 onto a photoswitchable SAM composed of a thiolated photochromic azobenzene (AZO) moiety ((E)-6-(4-(phenyldiazenyl)phenoxy)hexane-1-thiol, HS-C6AZO) chemisorbed on a gold substrate (Fig. 8c).222,250 AZO are photochromic molecules that can be switched between a trans and a cis isomer upon light irradiation at different wavelengths (Fig. 8c).251 When AZO molecules self-assemble forming ordered chemisorbed monolayers on metals, the photoswitch is accompanied by a modification of the surface energetics,252–254 which is in turn reflected by a change of the optical properties of MoS2 monolayers.222 In particular, lower (higher) PL intensity was measured when the AZO-SAM was in the trans (cis) state, which was ascribed to different doping induced by the two isomers (Fig. 8d).
The same Au/AZO-SAM/MoS2 stack was exploited to demonstrate photo-switchable vertical diodes, in which the current flowing vertically through the stack was measured by contacting the MoS2 sheet with a conductive tip in an atomic force microscope (AFM). With the AZO-SAM in the trans state, the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics (Fig. 8e) displayed a rectifying behaviour with turn-on voltage close to 0.5 V. After photo-isomerization to the cis state, the I–V traces showed a suppression of the rectification, while the diode-like characteristics could be partially recovered by switching back the AZO-SAM to the trans state. These experiments demonstrate the possibility to modify reversibly the energetics of TMDs thanks to a unique molecular capability, such as the switching of photochromic molecules. In this regard, hybrid systems composed of functional molecules and TMDs represent an entirely new class of materials characterized by unique properties different from those of the isolated components even in the absence of covalent bonds.


Physisorbed crystalline monolayers on TMDs. 
While in the previous section we have discussed the case of molecular tailoring of the bottom TMD surface, here we focus on the effects of non-covalent molecular modification of the top TMD surface. Supramolecular interactions, in particular of van der Waals type, can drive the formation of physisorbed crystalline monolayers of molecules onto TMDs, in which the molecular dipoles self-align,81,255,256 thereby giving rise to electrostatic effects analogous to those discussed in the previous section. This possibility was demonstrated experimentally in the works by Kang et al.,39,86 who prepared ordered molecular layers via physisorption of small molecules onto the top TMD surface, resulting in non-degenerate doping (Fig. 9). For an overview on molecular assembly on 2D materials and its theoretical aspects, we refer the reader to the more specific review article by Kumar et al. (ref. 83). In contrast to the case of TMDs onto SAM-modified substrates, the top surface modification makes it possible to measure the electrical characteristics of the TMDs before and after the formation of the molecular layer, enabling a precise estimation of the doping introduced by the molecular layer. Interestingly, the molecules investigated for the modification of the top surface of few-layer MoS2 and WSe2 (ODTS and APTES, Fig. 9a) bear the same functional groups used for tailoring the bottom substrate via SAM chemisorption (Fig. 8a).39,86Fig. 9b displays the effect of ultrathin octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS) layer on the electrical characteristics of WSe2. In this case, a relatively small shift of the threshold voltage towards more positive values was measured, indicative of p-type doping. An analogous p-type doping was observed for ODTS on MoS2, while the layer of APTES molecules was found to induce n-type doping on both WSe2 and MoS2 (Fig. 9c). These results are qualitatively similar to those obtained for the same molecules at the bottom of TMDs, and similarly were explained by considering that the doping effects were mediated by molecular dipoles, which effectively changed the surface energetics.86 In particular, it was proposed that the molecular assemblies on the top and at the bottom are specular, so that the TMD layer is influenced by analogous electric fields.

We would like to point out that the molecular dipole orientation is dictated by the molecular arrangement. The fact that similar doping effects are measured on different TMDs (MoS2 and WSe2, Fig. 9c) indicates that the arrangement of a given molecule on the sub-nanometre scale on different vdW surfaces is likely the same. Indeed, analogous vdW forces drive the formation of the same assembly on the rather inert surfaces of pristine layered materials.255,256
We mention that the presence of a molecular film on the surface of TMDs can be exploited not only to modify the properties of TMDs at a fundamental level, but also to enable technologically relevant applications. As an example, in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 9a–c, it was found that the molecules improved the photoresponsivity and detectivity of TMD-based photodetectors.39 Moreover, highly ordered molecular monolayers have been employed as ultrathin gate dielectrics for flexible electronics.91,257 In particular, high-quality dielectrics were obtained through the functionalization of ultra-thin metal oxide films with an organic SAM in a bottom gate configuration,91 as well as through the deposition of hybrid organic/inorganic layers onto MoS2 in a top gate configuration.257 The resulting transistors showed remarkable subthreshold swing, namely 69 mV dec−1 (ref. 91) and 79 mV dec−1 (ref. 257), low operating voltage (below 2 V),91,256 limited hysteresis (∼50 mV)257 and high breakdown field (∼7.8 MV cm−1).257

3. Covalent functionalization of substrate-supported TMDs via defect and phase engineering
During the last five years, several works have been published on the covalent functionalization of ultrathin TMDs, mainly focusing on solution-processed MoS2 nanosheets produced via ion intercalation (1T/1T′ phase)258,259 or ultrasonication (1H/2H) methods.110,260 These studies will be presented in Section 5, which is dedicated to solution-based approaches for the preparation of inks of functionalized TMDs. Here, we will review those investigations carried out on substrate-supported nanosheets, which aimed at “decorating” the top surface of the 2D materials with molecules through bond-formation processes. As mentioned in the introduction, MoS2 is the prototypical element of the TMD class,19 so that pioneering explorations in this research area have been carried out mostly on this promising 2D semiconductor. However, the concepts and strategies described in the following can be easily extended to other ultrathin TMDs, in particular MoWSeS materials, which have structural and physico-chemical properties similar to those of MoS2. Indeed, all MoWSeS crystals exhibit a stable 1H/2H semiconducting phase9,150 and their surface lacks dangling bonds, a fact that makes the covalent functionalization of the basal plane a challenging objective.80,110,200,259
In 2014, Azcatl et al.261 reported on a non-disruptive method for the functionalization of MoS2 based on exposure to UV-ozone. The latter induces the formation of an oxygen layer on the surface of the 2D semiconductor, which can be conveniently exploited as a seed layer for the growth of high-quality dielectric films by atomic layer deposition (ALD).261,262 Noticeably, the structural and the electronic properties of MoS2 were not found to be altered by the UV-ozone treatment, which supported the finding of weak bonding interactions between oxygen and sulfur atoms.261,262
Nowadays, two major strategies are being explored towards the strong covalent or coordinative bonds between TMDs and atomic or molecular adlayers. The first involves the activation/optimization of the chemical reactivity of the nanosheets’ surface via the controlled generation of point defects, such as chalcogen vacancies. In such a way, dangling bonds are generated locally at defect sites, enabling the formation of chemical bonds between the defective surface and molecules with ad hoc functional groups. The second method deals with the phase tunability of TMDs,135 which allows for the reversible conversion of the electron-rich and easy-to-functionalize polytype (1T/1T′) into the more inert semiconducting polytype (1H/2H).80 As we shall see, the latter approach enables preparing functionalized 1H/2H nanosheets through phase-conversion processes triggered by chemical or thermal stimuli.80
3.1 Engineering chemically-active defects
Numerous techniques have been used to engineer defects, such as chalcogen vacancies, in the basal plane of ultrathin TMDs, among which electron irradiation,263–266 thermal annealing,88,267,268 electrochemical generation,186 plasma treatments,185,269–272 as well as physical bombardments with charged particles, including ions of argon,109,273–275 helium,276–278 manganese,279 α particles (He2+)159 and swift heavy ions (e.g. Xe/Ta, E ≈ 80–100 MeV).280 Moreover, chalcogen vacancies have been systematically generated during the growth/synthesis process via non-equilibrium CVD methods,223 as well as through hydrothermal synthetic strategies.281 Theoretical calculations have also been carried out to corroborate experimental results and elucidate the structures/properties of the defects produced with such techniques, e.g. in the case of electron irradiation (ref. 68 and 266) and ion bombardment (ref. 282). In 2012, Komsa et al.68 carried out a joint theoretical and experimental investigation on the effects of electron irradiation on the atomic structure of ultrathin TMDs. In particular, they observed the formation of sulfur vacancies (SV) in 1H-MoS2 sheets exposed to an electron beam (E ≈ 80 keV) within a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The possibility of filling the SVs with donor and acceptor impurities – with the objective of introducing doping – was supported by calculations of the formation energy of substitutional defects. Experimentally, in situ HR-TEM studies provided evidence for the occurrence of SV filling (see Fig. 10a–c), though it was not possible to identify the type of the impurity involved in the process. Subsequent theoretical works were carried out on substitutional doping of TMDs, and various strategies have been proposed for adding novel functionalities to MoS2 by means of magnetic, rare-earth and chalcogen dopants, as well as molecular ions.283,284 More recently, a combined TEM and Raman-spectroscopy study (ref. 264) allowed establishing a correlation between the density of SVs in electron-irradiated MoS2 nanosheets and the energies of the main Raman-active phonon modes (E12g and A1g), thereby providing an indirect means for quantifying SVs in ultrathin MoS2.

In 2013, Ma et al.273 showed that low-energy (E ≈ 500 eV) argon-ion irradiation of monolayer MoS2 results in the controlled generation of SVs, as evidenced by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) studies, see Fig. 10d. In contrast to their electron counterpart, ion beams have relatively larger diameters (∼100s μm) and can be rastered over centimetre-scale large areas in relatively short time, enabling the fast processing of wafer-scale CVD-grown films. Although this was the first study on a truly 2D semiconductor, it should be mentioned that several investigations have been carried out in the past on the effects of argon ion bombardment on bulk TMD crystals.187,285–290 In 1972, Williams et al.285 performed low-energy (E ≈ 300 eV) argon-ion bombardment on the surface of various layered chalcogenide materials, among which MoS2, NbSe2, ZrS2, MoTe2, TiTe2 and SnS2, revealing – in most of the cases – a significant enhancement of the reactivity of the basal plane in the presence of oxygen species. This was attributed to the pitting and faceting of the surface upon ion bombardment, leading to the increase of the effective surface area of the sample.285 However, little was known about the structure of the defects. Two years later, Feng and Chen286 conducted XPS measurements on bulk MoS2 crystals irradiated with argon ions of ∼300 eV, and observed the formation of islands of metallic molybdenum along with a decrease in the sulfur content. The authors hypothesized that sulfur atoms, which have a mass close to that of argon, could be ejected more efficiently in comparison to heavier molybdenum atoms, thereby enabling a selective sputtering process. Nowadays, bombardment with argon-ion beams is a common and established method for engineering chalcogen vacancies in ultrathin TMDs,109,273,274 together with similar techniques based on plasmas of argon ions.185,272 In 2016, Li et al.185 showed – both theoretically and experimentally – that SVs generated via argon plasmas lead to the activation of the basal plane of 1H-MoS2 monolayers for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which could be further optimized through the application of in-plane strain. The HER activity of 1H-MoS2 sheets has also been enhanced through electrochemical desulfurization processes (ref. 186), which allowed tuning the density of SVs by changing the applied desulfurization potential. Additionally, complementary thermal approaches have been developed for the generation of SVs, such as annealing in ultra-high vacuum (p ≈ 10−9 Torr, T ≥ 200 °C)267 or in air (T ≈ 250 °C).88
Having a high density of chemically-active chalcogen vacancies is desired for the purpose of functionalization, but it can also be very detrimental in other perspectives, e.g. for applications in (opto)electronic devices. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully assess the impact of such defects on the functional properties of the 2D semiconducting materials, such as for instance the charge-carrier mobility and the threshold voltage in FET devices.
In a recent work, the effects of ion-beam induced SVs on the optical, vibrational, as well charge transport properties of mechanically-exfoliated monolayer MoS2 have been investigated (ref. 109). The unencapsulated channel of back-gated monolayer FETs were irradiated with low-energy (E ≈ 500 eV) argon ions, as shown in Fig. 10e. This allowed monitoring the evolution of the electrical characteristic of the devices with increasing ion dose, as shown in Fig. 10f and g. Noticeably, the experiments were carried out under inert atmosphere to minimize possible oxygen chemisorption at defect sites, which could affect the electronic structures/properties of semiconducting TMDs.291 The results reported in this work109 provided a guideline for the trade-off choice between density of SVs suitable for chemical functionalization and device performance, in terms for instance of charge-carrier mobility and Ion/Ioff switching ratio in FETs.
3.2 Repair and functionalization of defective TMDs
In the last few years, various research groups have explored the possibility of repairing/functionalizing defective MoS2 nanosheets with small organic molecules carrying thiol headgroups.88,109,292 Interestingly, the reactivity of SVs with thiol molecules has been investigated since the 1970s, mainly due to the widespread use of MoS2 as a catalyst for hydrodesulfurization to remove sulfur from oil.293 The adsorption and decomposition of alkanethiols on defective MoS2 surfaces have been previously investigated, for instance in the case of butanethiol,293 ethanethiol,294 methanethiol295 and dodecanethiol.181 In 2012, Makarova et al.181 reported a STM study supporting the hypothesis of bond formation between thiol groups and unsaturated molybdenum atoms at SV sites. In particular, two thiol derivatives – namely (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane (MPS) and dodecanethiol – were adsorbed to the surface of bulk 2H-MoS2 crystals, as schematized in Fig. 11a. The density of molecules was found to match the typical density of SVs in common MoS2 samples, suggesting a possible chemisorption of the thiol molecules at SV sites. Interestingly, the authors observed that both thiol derivatives could be easily desorbed from the surface by applying electrical stimuli with the STM tip, a phenomenon that was ascribed to the tip-induced dissociation of the S–C bond (Fig. 11b). Remarkably, such a process was found to lead to the filling/repairing of the SVs. Inspired by these results, Yu et al.182 developed a thiol-chemistry approach with the aim of healing defects and improving the charge-transport properties of ultrathin sheets of MoS2. The treatment consists in the immersion of SiO2/Si substrates carrying mechanically-exfoliated MoS2 flakes in a solution of MPS in dichloromethane, followed by thermal annealing (T ≈ 50 °C, 20 min) to induce the scission of the S–C bond and remove the excess MPS molecules. Density functional theory calculations (DFT) were carried out to assess the kinetics of the reaction (Fig. 11c). The effective reduction of the number of SVs was supported by a statistical analysis of HR-TEM images acquired from as-exfoliated and treated samples, which revealed a decrease in the average SV density from ∼6 × 1013 cm−2 to ∼1.6 × 1013 cm−2. Thanks to their trimethoxysilane groups that chemisorb on SiO2, MPS molecules have also been used for the formation of SAMs on the oxidized silicon substrates. In this case, the molecules expose their thiol groups towards the overlying MoS2 nanosheets, thereby providing – upon annealing – an opportunity for healing SVs in the bottom surface. The effects of such thiol-chemistry treatments on the electrical properties of back-gated MoS2 FETs are reported in Fig. 11d and e. Upon repairing SVs in the top and bottom surfaces, the field-effect mobility increases up to ∼80 cm2 V−1 s−1 (at room temperature), which is one of the highest values achieved so far using back-gated monolayer MoS2 FETs on conventional SiO2/Si substrates.225 A follow-up work by Cho et al.292 focused on the passivation of SVs in multilayer MoS2 sheets (2–11 nm thick) with alkanethiol molecules. The healing procedure, based on the immersion of the samples into an ethanol solution of hexadecanethiol (or octanethiol) molecules, did not include the annealing step previously used to promote the scission of the S–C bond and the removal of not-chemisorbed molecules. As a result, the electrical current and the charge-carrier mobility in FETs were found to decrease. This was ascribed to trap states associated with alkanethiol molecules chemisorbed at SVs. Sim et al.88 adopted a similar approach aiming at introducing a stable doping in few-layer MoS2 nanosheets (2–4 layer thick) via chemisorption of thiol molecules carrying donor or acceptor groups, see Fig. 11f. After immersing the samples in ethanol solutions of mercaptoethylamine (NH2-terminated thiol, MEA) and 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol (CF3-terminated thiol, FDT), the authors performed a mild annealing under inert atmosphere (100 °C, 30 min) and an abundant solvent rinsing to remove unbound molecules. Such a treatment resulted in n-doping in the case of MEA (Δn ≈ 3.7 × 1012 cm−2) and p-doping in the case of FDT (Δn ≈ −7.0 × 1011 cm−2), which was supported by multiple techniques, including PL spectroscopy, XPS and electrical measurements. In FETs, the doping effect appeared more evident after an additional annealing step (T ≈ 150 °C, 10 min) that served for removing water and oxygen molecules that are known to behave as electron acceptors.296 The resulting transfer characteristics of pristine (black) and doped (red and blue) few-layer MoS2 FETs are shown in Fig. 11g. More recently, short-chain alkanethiols, such as butanethiol, have also been used to heal SVs introduced via low-energy ion irradiation in the channel of monolayer MoS2 FETs (ref. 109). In this case, a vapour-phase deposition process – carried out strictly under inert atmosphere without other external influences – enabled a significant recovery of the electrical characteristics of ion-irradiated FETs, confirming the occurrence of defect healing by thiol molecules.

The results discussed so far showed that repair (involving the dissociation of the S–C bond) and functionalization of SVs via chemisorption of thiols are two possible outcomes. This aspect has been investigated theoretically by two groups,183,184 who showed by means of DFT calculations that both reactions can actually occur. Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved might vary depending not only temperature but also on polarization effects associated with the molecule's decorating groups.183 In the case of methanethiol, Förster et al.184 found that repair is energetically most favourable over functionalization, whereas Li et al.183 concluded that functionalization products are preferred due to slightly smaller energy barriers. However, it should be noticed that such discrepancies may arise from different assumptions on the role of hydrogen in the reaction (adsorption/release), which is a debated argument in the chemistry of thiols at metal surfaces.247,297–301 At this stage, more investigations are needed to identify the exact experimental conditions leading to the repair or functionalization of SVs.
The methods discussed above can be extended to other elements of the TMD family, in particular MoWSeS materials. For instance, the generation, healing and doping functionalization of selenium vacancies in ultrathin WSe2 have been already reported in the last years.79,270,302 It is expected that 2D transition metal selenides could be similarly functionalized/repaired with molecules carrying selenol headgroups,303 or once again repaired with thiol molecules – since sulfur and selenium are valence-isoelectronic elements – and this would allow developing 2D nanosheets with tunable chalcogen composition (e.g. WS2xSe2(1−x)).304 Despite problems associated to the limited chemical stability of selenol exposing molecules, novel investigations can be foreseen to explore the viability of these approaches.
3.3 Covalent functionalization via phase engineering
An alternative strategy for the covalent functionalization of ultrathin MoS2 was reported in 2015 by Chhowalla and coworkers.80 Such a method does not involve chemical reactions at defect sites, as previously discussed, but it rather exploits the phase tunability of TMDs135via chemical and thermal stimuli. It is known that chemical exfoliation with n-butyllithium leads to electron-rich nanosheets that contain ∼65% of the metallic 1T/1T′ polytype.141,142 Interestingly, also the exposure of substrate-supported CVD MoS2 sheets to n-butyllithium results in the change from the 1H to the 1T/1T′ phase, as illustrated in Fig. 12b. This procedure was later shown to be applicable to continuous polycrystalline MoX2 films.305 This can be performed in a spatially-controlled manner, which is suitable for patterning metallic regions in a semiconducting 2D layer to develop low-resistance contacts for ultrathin MoS2 FETs.306 Chhowalla et al.80 showed that metallic 1T/1T′ nanosheets can be easily functionalized by subjecting them to methyl iodide and iodoacetamide electrophiles (see Fig. 12a), resulting in functional groups that are covalently bound to sulfur atoms. Here, the reaction is promoted by charge transfer between the electron-rich 1T/1T′ MoS2 and the organohalides, which allows for achieving a degree of functionalization of the order of ∼30% (estimated by XPS). Atomic-resolution TEM studies carried out on functionalized nanosheets revealed that the original atomic structure with octahedral coordination is not altered by such a process (Fig. 12c). However, the functionalized 2D MoS2 displayed optical properties remarkably different from those of its not-functionalized counterpart, including fluorescence emission (Fig. 12d). The latter indicates the opening of a semiconducting bandgap, which is a promising result proving the possibility of tailoring ultrathin TMDs by the combination of chemical and phase-engineering approaches. The authors further showed that CVD monolayer MoS2 films can be converted from 1H to 1T/1T′ via n-butyllithium exposure; they can then be functionalized with electrophile molecules and subsequently re-converted into the 1H polytype by thermal annealing at T ≥ 300 °C. Raman and XPS spectroscopy confirmed the occurrence of the semiconducting-phase recovery, whereas attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy indicated that functional groups were still present on the surface of the 1H MoS2 sheets. This technique – based on a two-step phase conversion process – is being regarded as a promising strategy for the covalent functionalization of substrate-supported semiconducting MoWSeS materials, which otherwise could not be functionalized in their pristine form due to the lack of dangling bonds. It is worth noting that the methods described above were applied also to WS2 and MoSe2, and are expected to be applicable to other TMDs.76,80 In this research area, additional investigations are envisioned for tuning of the optical and electronic properties of ultrathin TMDs ad hoc for applications, which can be achieved for instance by a careful choice/design of the electrophile molecules.

4. Chemical treatments for optimizing optical processes in substrate-supported TMDs
The modifications in the optical properties of TMDs discussed in Section 2 arise from changes in the charge-carrier density induced by molecular layers.102,103,209,307 Here, we discuss a few recent experiments showing how appropriate chemical treatments can be used to optimize the photoluminescence (PL) emission in substrate-supported 2D TMDs in a way that cannot be explained by doping, and which involves the passivation of surface defects. The interactions involved in such processes often lie at the borderline between covalent and non-covalent chemistry and therefore have not been included in one of the two previous sections.
Typically, the doping-induced PL modulation is relatively weak for monolayer MoS2, with p-dopants inducing up to three-fold PL increase.252 In contrast, Amani et al.97 reported on a two-orders-of-magnitude increase in the PL of chemically-treated MoS2, reaching near-unity quantum yield. In particular, the authors demonstrated that a treatment with the nonoxidizing organic superacid bis(trifluoromethane)-sulfonimide (TFSI, inset in Fig. 13a) determined an up-to-190-fold increase in the PL intensity without significant changes in the spectral lineshape (Fig. 13a). PL maps of the same 2D MoS2 sheet measured before and after the superacid treatment revealed that the increase was spatially homogeneous (Fig. 13b). Remarkably, it was found that at low excitation intensity (<10−2 W cm−2), the PL quantum yield approached ∼1, i.e. almost the totality of the incoming photons were re-emitted (Fig. 13c). Following the discussion in Section 2, one might expect the PL boost to be mediated by p-doping, since TFSI is a strong electron acceptor.308 Through the comparative electrical characterization of a 2D-MoS2 FET before and after the superacid treatment, the authors demonstrated that TFSI would not induce significant p-type doping. Instead, the passivation of surface defects was put forward as main effect leading to the increased PL.97 Indeed, the low PL quantum yield of (untreated) MoS2 at low excitation power is typically attributed to defect mediated non-radiative recombination;70 hence the near-unity quantum yield of the treated samples indicates a defect passivation. However, the exact mechanism through which defects are passivated is not entirely understood. More recent studies have shown that the same superacid treatment could be successfully applied to CVD-grown MoS2,98 and that its effect could be made stable by encapsulation with a CYTOP film.309 Moreover, it was demonstrated that not only the PL of MoS2 but also that of WS2 is boosted by the TSFI treatment.96 On the contrary, the TSFI treatment does not enhance the quantum yield of Se-based TMDs, such as WSe2 and MoSe2.96 An STM investigation of the defects in sulfide- and selenide-based TMDs suggested that the different effects of the TSFI treatment could be explained by the distinct nature of the defects in TMD selenides and sulfides.96 In particular, the defects found on sulfide surfaces were either structural defects or acceptor impurities, whereas those found on selenide surfaces were mainly donor impurities.96

Similarly to the case of TFSI, an acid-mediated sulfur vacancies self-healing was put forward in a recent experiment in which MoS2 was placed in contact with non-oxidizing acid poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS).310 In this case, self-healing was accompanied by a p-type doping effect and a rather limited PL increase (two-fold).
A similar acid based self-healing of defects was demonstrated for Se-based TMDs. In particular, it was demonstrated that the PL of CVD-grown MoSe2 could be increased via treatment with hydracids.100 The highest effect was found for hydrohalic acid (HBr), which caused a 30-fold increase in the PL of MoSe2 (see Fig. 13d and e). In this case, two concomitant mechanisms were identified to account for the measured effect: (i) an induced p-type doping, as inferred from a Raman characterization and (ii) an acid-mediated structural healing, inferred on the basis of low temperature PL spectra and XPS characterization. In particular, for untreated MoSe2 sheets, the PL spectrum was dominated by a rather broad PL peak at ∼1.56 eV, which was ascribed to the radiative emission of excitons bound to defects (Fig. 13f). Instead, after HBr treatment, the low temperature PL became more structured, with two sharper peaks corresponding to the neutral exciton and trion peak. The decrease in the relative intensity of the defect-related peak indicated the HBr-induced defect healing in MoSe2. In particular, the authors found spectroscopic evidences of undesired oxidized Se in the as-grown CVD MoSe2, and concluded that HBr effectively passivates these defects by replacing oxidized Se defects (Se–O) with Br, which covalently binds to Mo atoms.100
These experiments indicate the potential of acid treatments to passivate defect-mediated recombination pathways in TMDs, leading to almost-ideal optical properties. Therefore, the chemically treated ultrathin TMDs might enable the demonstration of optimized optoelectronic devices, such as high-performance light-emitting diodes, lasers and solar cells.
5. Functionalization of solution-processed TMD nanosheets
Functionalization can also be achieved on TMD nanosheets in the liquid phase by a number of strategies. The prerequisite is an efficient exfoliation in liquid to obtain colloidally stable dispersions. For TMDs, two main strategies exist which are referred to as chemical exfoliation (CE) and liquid phase exfoliation (LPE), respectively. Chemical exfoliation is based on the intercalation chemistry of TMDs first described in the 1970s.117,311 Based on these early reports, the intercalation chemistry was explored in the past century.312 The current understanding of the chemical exfoliation is described in detail elsewhere15,115 and is only briefly summarized here. The most commonly used technique is based on the reaction of bulk TMD powder with n-BuLi under inert conditions. Lithium is inserted between the layers followed by an electron transfer to the TMD resulting in an LixMX2 salt. Due to the Coulomb repulsion between the negatively charged layers, efficient exfoliation down to predominantly monolayers can be achieved after agitation/sonication in water. After purification (removal of excess n-BuLi, reaction side products, unexfoliated TMD), a colloidal suspension of negatively charged nanosheets in water is obtained. Due to the excess charge, the MoWSeS-TMDs undergo a transition from the semiconducting 2H polytype (trigonal prismatic arrangement of chalcogen) to the metallic 1T/1T′ polytype (octahedral arrangement of chalcogen, often distorted)115 – see Section 1.1. The metallic 1T-polytype is metastable and can be converted to the 2H-polytype by annealing or ageing, which is usually accompanied by flocculation of the TMDs if this takes place in the dispersion. Depending on the reaction conditions,259,313,314 defective nanosheets (chalcogen vacancies and/or holes on the basal plane) or mixtures of the 1T/2H-polytype are accessible.
A complementary technique that yields colloidally stable dispersions of group-6 TMDs in the semiconducting 2H-polytype is liquid phase exfoliation (LPE). As summarized in detail in recent reviews,106,315–319 this process involves sonication (or other forms of agitation such as shearing, ball milling) of the bulk powder in appropriate solvents or aqueous surfactant systems. A range of polymers (including biopolymers) can also be used as stabilizing agents in both aqueous and organic media. The energy or mechanical stress is required to overcome the van der Waals-type intersheet interaction and causes exfoliation of the bulk material into few-layers in the liquid with the nanosheet reaggregation prevented by the solvent/stabilizer. This process has first been demonstrated in 1989 via sonication of TMDs in water in an argon–hydrogen atmosphere.320 However, in ambient conditions, water as a neat solvent (i.e. without additional stabilizers) is not a suitable solvent to stabilize the TMD nanosheets. It was first demonstrated by Coleman et al. in 2011122 that solvents with solubility parameters matching the TMD can be used to obtain colloidally stable dispersions under ambient conditions. Suitable solubility parameters to describe the solution thermodynamics are solvent surface tension or energy, Hildebrandt parameters or Hansen parameters. Typical solvent choices are N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl formamide or isopropanol to a lesser extent. Alternatively, as first demonstrated by the same group,321 aqueous surfactant solutions can be used. The resultant nanosheet dispersions are highly polydisperse with respect to both layer number and lateral size, but size selection techniques have been developed to tackle this problem.322
Using such nanosheet dispersions, numerous strategies have been developed to functionalize both basal plane and edges (Fig. 14). Due to the high surface area of the nanosheets, non-covalent functionalization via physisorption of various molecules, polymers (or noble metal nanoparticles) is commonly exploited. Note that numerous hybrid structures with other nanomaterials can be constructed in such a way as outlined elsewhere.323 The most widespread use of this non-covalent approach is to prevent nanosheets from reaggregation after LPE by adsorption of small molecules105,321,324–334 or (bio)polymers335–363 (see Table 2). The organic functional groups are believed to adsorb to the nanosheets via predominantly van der Waals interactions but dipole interactions can also occur.203,364
 Fig. 14  Overview of functionalization strategies for TMDs in the liquid phase based on chemically exfoliated (CE-MX2) and liquid phase exfoliated (LPE-MX2) nanosheets. In addition to physisorption, different approaches for chemisorption exist. These can be classified as covalent (involving X–C bonds), coordinative (involving chalcogens as ligands) and defect functionalization. Defects such as chalcogen vacancies can also be used for coordination chemistry involving dative bonds with nucleophiles.

Similar to graphene, stabilization in the aqueous environment in the case of ionic surfactants is achieved mostly due to Coulomb repulsion that can be described within the Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory, even though steric hindrance can also play an important role.365 Unfortunately, it is extremely challenging to unravel experimentally how the surfactant adsorption occurs, or indeed how densely the surfactant is packed on the surface. Ref. 328 is highlighted in this regard, as it provides evidence that surfactant chains of the cationic amphiphile cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) lie flat, arranged randomly on the basal plane of the MoS2 nanosheets with their charged headgroup exposed. It was also shown that they exchange rapidly with free surfactants in the surrounding water. One of the most widely used classes of surfactants are facial amphiphiles such as sodium cholate (SC).105,321,326,329–331,333 As demonstrated in the original work,321 such surfactant-based dispersions can be used to fabricate thin films or nanocomposites (e.g. by vacuum filtration) which can for example be used as electrodes in electrochemical water splitting.366,367 However, as shown recently, SC can have detrimental effects on electrocatalysis,368 which emphasizes that more research is required to explore strategies to remove physisorbed molecules/polymers after processing for certain applications.
In the case of non-ionic surfactants334 or polymers,335–347 stabilization is due to steric effects that can be described in the framework of solution thermodynamics.336 In general, poloxamers (e.g. Pluronics)337,341,343,346,347,369 are the most widely studied polymeric stabilizers. In particular Pluronic F68 has been used to decrease the buoyant density of the nanosheet–polymer hybrid in water to allow for thickness sorting in a density gradient.369 Among the various structural characteristics, the thickness of the TMD sheets is known to define their properties; hence, the use of efficient layer number separation techniques is important. However, the yields of this process are currently low due to a low monolayer yield in the initial dispersion.369 This encouraged the authors to screen 19 different poloxamers with respect to their exfoliation efficiency (dispersed nanosheet concentration and monolayer content).343 Nevertheless, as outlined in ref. 337, the presence of polymers during the exfoliation can result in poorer exfoliation compared to solvent or small molecule-assisted LPE in terms of mean layer number and lower dispersed concentration, as the surface tension of the liquid increases with the polymer concentration. The authors suggested to add the polymer stepwisely during the exfoliation to overcome this.337
In addition, a range of natural polymers/oligomers348–363 have been exploited in the non-covalent functionalization as summarized in Table 2. These are typically used to obtain biocompatible TMDs for biomedical198 and biosensing370 applications. Popular examples include chitosan,351,352,360,361 bovine serum albumin353,354 or oligonucleotide sequences.355,356,362 The interaction with the TMDs can be considered as predominantly van der Waals-type, while the stabilization is based on both Coulomb and steric repulsion.
Another non-covalent functionalization strategy is based on the electrostatic interaction of cationic molecules with negatively charged 1T-TMDs.371–373 Such colloids are more stable than the 1T-MX2 in water on its own371 or can be used for a solvent exchange to organic media.372,373 Stabilization with oleylamine in high boiling point solvents such as octadecene or o-dichlorobenzene allows the conversion of 1T-MX2 to 2H-MX2 in the dispersions by heating without causing flocculation.373
Even though the basal plane of TMDs is widely considered inert, a number of functionalization strategies via chemisorption have been developed. As illustrated in Fig. 14, these can be classified as (i) covalent (ii) coordinative, (iii) defect or (iv) coordinative defect functionalization. Note that not all strategies are accessible from both 1T-CE-MX2 and 2H-LPE-MX2 or lead to a different result with respect to the degree of functionalization (number of functional groups per MX2) or type of binding as illustrated in Fig. 15 and summarized in Tables 2–6.
 Fig. 15  Schematic of reaction pathways to achieve functionalization via chemisorption. (a) Pathways building on chemical exfoliation via intercalation with n-butyllithium. This process yields negatively charged MX2 nanosheets in the 1T/1T′ polytype which can be further derivatized via (i) coordination of thiols to chalcogen vacancy sites (defect functionalization), (ii) reductive covalent functionalization with electrophiles such as organohalides or diazonium salts, or (iii) physisorption of metal nanoparticles. (b) Pathways building on liquid phase exfoliation in appropriate solvents or aqueous surfactants. This strategy yields few-layered nanosheets of the semiconducting 2H-polytype. These can be functionalized by (i) coordination of electron donors (dithiolanes or carboxylic acids) to sulfur deficient edges, (ii) coordination to metal complexes using the chalcogen as ligand, or (iii) nanoparticles covalently bound to nanosheet edges.

Covalent modification refers to a reductive functionalization of negatively charged 1T-CE-MX2 with electrophiles and involves the formation of a carbon–chalcogen bond on the basal plane.78,80,196,259,374–376 In the first report by Voiry et al.,80 CE-1T-MoS2, -WS2 and -MoSe2 were reacted with alkyl halides (or an aryl diazonium salt). Similar to the first covalent functionalization of graphene,377 the electrophile attacks the negatively charged nanosheets. On charge neutralization, a covalent carbon–chalcogen bond is formed on the basal plane with degrees of functionalization of 20% (with respect to functional groups per MX2 unit). The successful functionalization was evidenced by 13C-NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). XPS spectra of functionalized 1T-MoS2 (Fig. 16a) show evidence for a S–C in the S core level spectra in addition to the characteristic features of 1T-, and 2H-MoS2. The chalcogen–carbon bond is further observed in the IR spectra (Fig. 16b) in addition to the alkyl vibrations of the functional group. Importantly, the peak frequency shifts depending on the chalcogen as would be expected. The 1T-polytype is retained, but exhibits semiconducting properties after covalent functionalization due to the charge neutralization.

In a subsequent work, the question was addressed whether defects often present on CE-1T-MX2 are required for successful functionalization.259 This was achieved by intercalating MoS2 with excess MoS2 over n-BuLi. Compared to the traditional intercalation that uses excess n-BuLi, a significant portion of the MX2 (∼50%) remains in its 2H-polytype as confirmed by XPS (Fig. 16c and d). In addition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the nanosheets are less defective (Fig. 16e). Covalent functionalization of CE-2H/1T-MoS2 with an aryldiazonium salt was evidenced (by XPS, IR spectroscopy and TGA coupled to mass spectrometry), albeit with lower degrees of functionalization (∼10% per MoS2 unit). In spite of this lower degree of functionalization, it is clear that defects or the 1T-polytype are not a prerequisite for the reductive functionalization and it will be possible to tailor the degree of surface decoration via the amount of charges initially present on the CE-MX2. The 1T-polytype was found to convert rapidly (within a few days) into the 2H-polytype in the case of the CE-2H/1T-MoS2 from intercalation using excess MoS2. However, it is stabilized after functionalization. In analogy to the work by Voiry et al.,80 it was suggested that it exhibits semiconducting properties. This covalent functionalization has subsequently been used to anchor various organic functionalities,78,374–376 or to graft molecules on the TMD surface that can be used as ligands for further derivatization via coordination chemistry.375,376 This approach is particularly interesting for catalytic applications. In a recent study, it has also been shown that 4-carboxy benzene diazonium salt can be reacted with edges of LPE-2H-MoS2 in the presence of an amine catalyst.196 Cross-linking of the edges in a network via hydrogen bonding provided the proof of concept that such edge functionalization sequences can play an important role in (opto)electronics in the future, as the authors observe a drastically increased charge-carrier mobility in the network. It is worth noting that despite MoS2 nanosheets are known to behave as unipolar n-type semiconductors, the authors reported an unusual unipolar p-type transport, whose origin cannot be easily rationalized.
Alternatively, the basal plane of 2H-LPE-TMDs can be decorated by cationic metal complexes using the TMD chalcogens as ligands in a Lewis acid–base type of coordination chemistry.110,378 This strategy builds on the work of Tremel et al. on MoS2-fullerenes379 and has recently been adapted for the functionalization of InSe.380 In particular Cu2+ ions were identified as suitable anchors to the TMD chalcogens (as evidenced by IR spectroscopy and XPS). This strategy is interesting, as it is a rare example of the chemical basal plane functionalization of the semiconducting 2H-polytype which is retained after the functionalization.110 However, it remains little explored and further work will be required to demonstrate its versatility as well as possibilities of further derivatization.
The most commonly used chemisorption strategy exploits chalcogen vacancy defects to coordinate nucleophiles in dative bonds, in particular thiols112,258,381–390 with dithiolane391 used to a lesser extent. This functionalization concept often referred to as ligand conjugation was first introduced by Dravid and coworkers in 2013,258 where CE-1T-MoS2 was reacted with a number of thiol-terminated polyethylene glycol derivatives bearing different ionic and non-ionic headgroups. This leads to a tuneable and pH-stable colloidal stability (Fig. 16g top). Zeta potential measurements suggest the successful decoration of the nanosheet surface, as the zeta potential could be tuned from ∼−60 to 40 mV depending on the functional group. The disappearance of SH vibrations in the IR spectra indicate that thiols are deprotonated and the S bound to the MoS2. In this strategy, CE-1T-MoS2 is typically used,258,382,384–388,390,391 as it exhibits a higher density of sulfur vacancies than LPE-2H-MX2 unless they are introduced on purpose.383 However, as discussed in Sections 1.1 and 3.1, such defect sites (amongst others) are also observed in micromechanically-cleaved or CVD-grown monolayers,69,157,158,164 so this strategy is not restricted to liquid-suspended nanosheets.88,292,392 In the case of LPE-2H-MX2, edge functionalization is believed to be more favourable, for example by coordinating polyacrylic acid192 or dithiolane derivatives194,195 to metal-rich edges and thionine193 or polybutadiene393 to sulfur-rich edges, respectively. Note that in the latter two cases,193,393 the ligand serves as an electron acceptor in the coordinative bond.
In some cases, thiol coordination to the basal plane of LPE-2H-MoS2 has been suggested,381,389 but no unambiguous proof (for example by the emergence of new species in the sulfur core level spectra in XPS) has been provided. Frequently, the disappearance of the S–H vibrations in IR spectroscopy (for example Fig. 16g) serves as indicator for the successful defect functionalization. However, as demonstrated by McDonald and coworkers,260 this can be due to a TMD-mediated dimerization of thiols to disulfides. In their work, the authors260 added cystine to LPE-2H-MoS2 in isopropanol and observed a dimerization to cysteine and subsequent physisorption rather than a coordination of the thiol to the MoS2. This was a puzzling observation, in particular because no thiol coordination could be evidenced in the reference experiment using CE-1T-MoS2. DFT calculations by Li et al.183 suggest that such a SV-mediated dimerization can be a thermodynamically favourable process. In their reaction pathway, a MoS2 SV-mediated homolytic bond cleavage of the S–H is suggested as the first step which then leads to functionalized MoS2 in an exothermic reaction prior to a potential dimerization. However, the activation energy for the dimerization was found to be high (91.5 kJ mol−1) – unless free radicals are present – which does not properly account for the observation by McDonald and coworkers.
A recent theoretical work by Förster et al.184 provides an alternative explanation to the question why sometimes defect functionalization occurs and sometimes dimerization of the thiol to disulfides. Their DFT calculations revealed that, depending on the nature of defects, an addition of a thiol results in either defect healing, coordination of the sulfur bearing ligand, or formation of disulfides/hydrodisulfides. For example, if sulfur vacancies are present, the thiol can coordinate to the exposed Mo via a transition state in an endothermic reaction, where the S–H bond is broken and the sulfur terminated molecule adsorbs to the exposed molybdenum and the hydrogen binds to a neighbouring sulfur atom on the MoS2. This is followed by either vacancy healing or chemisorption of the functional group via the sulfur (accompanied with the release of hydrogen) in exothermic reactions. Based on the energetics, the vacancy healing should be favourable. However, if sulfur adatoms are present, the formation of a disulfide can occur in an exothermic reaction via a hydrodisulfide (net energy release of ca. −1 eV) resulting in the formation of a disulfide and structurally perfect MoS2 (adatom healing) accompanied by the release of H2S, albeit with a high activation energy of ∼3 eV. Energetics are more favourable if the hydrodisulfide interacts with a nearby sulfur vacancy. This theoretical work is an excellent foundation to explain the different experimental observations. For example, the work by Jeong et al.194 showed via XPS that lipoic acid coordinates to LPE-2H-MoS2via the dithiolane group. This is in contrast to the above mentioned work by McDonald and coworkers, where no coordination (of neither disulfide nor thiol) was observed.260 In both cases, LPE-2H-MoS2 was used. However, the protocol differed in a significant aspect: in the case of the work by Jeong et al.,194 the reagent lipoic acid was used directly as surfactant and was thus present during the LPE by sonication, while in the case of the study by McDonald and coworkers,260 the reagent cysteine was added after the exfoliation in IPA was performed. Since theoretical work has shown that oxidation of MoS2 can readily occur on both the sulfur vacant basal plane,394 as well as edge,395 the coordination of the sulfur species can potentially be prevented in ambient conditions, if oxidation occurs prior to functionalization. Furthermore, it should be noted that chalcogen and vacancy defects are not the only defects that can be present. For example, numerous antisite defects have also been observed experimentally.164 To fully exploit defect functionalization in TMDs, it will therefore be crucial to control both type and content of defects and systematically study their impact on the respective functionalization.
The chemistry of liquid-suspended TMDs can furthermore be exploited to decorate the nanosheets with noble metal (Au, Pt, Ag, Pd) nanoparticles (NPs). These structures are particularly interesting for catalysis, plasmonics or sensing.339,396–410 The growth of can be achieved via non-covalently or covalently bound organic surface functionalities374,385,402,403,405 nicely illustrating that TMD functionalization can be used to create hybrid structures. Alternatively, NPs can be grown directly on both CE-1T-MX2 and LPE-2H-MX2 nanosheets after reduction of noble metal precursor salts.341,396–401,406,411,412 Typically, an additional reducing agent is added,396,398–401,411 even though the spontaneous formation (i.e. without additional reducing agent) has also been observed in some cases.341,396,397,406,412 This is documented to be the case when CE-1T-MoS2396,397,412 or CE-1T-WS2397 are used. In such a way, a number of noble metal nanoparticles like Pd, Pt or Au can be epitaxially grown on the 1T-MX2 surface. Typical TEM images are shown in Fig. 17a–c. Notably, decoration occurs on the basal plane and XPS (for Au-decorated nanosheets in Fig. 17d) does not show evidence for a covalent binding. This is likely because the excess charges of the CE-MX2 can reduce the metal precursor salt resulting in the nucleation of physisorbed nanoparticles on both basal plane and edge. (Note that the non-covalent binding has not been unambiguously confirmed in all reports.)

In contrast to these reports on CE-1T-MoX2, a covalent bond formation between the sulfur of the TMD and AuNPs was demonstrated according to XPS (Fig. 17e) in hybrid materials obtained after reaction of HAuCl4 with LPE-2H-WS2 in the absence of additional reducing agents.406 In this case, the NPs are predominantly located at nanosheet edges and terraces of incompletely exfoliated nanosheets (Fig. 17f). It was suggested that thiol functionalities present on edges and defect sites act as reducing agent for the initial nucleation resulting in a conversion to disulfides, as indirectly confirmed by an increased electrocatalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction, where disulfides are the predominant active sites.413 Due to the higher mass of Au-decorated WS2 opposed to the native WS2 in combination with the edge decoration, an enrichment of monolayers was readily achieved by centrifugation resulting in WS2 dispersions with monolayer volume fractions of 50–90% (depending on the initial lateral size of the LPE-WS2) with a sparse decoration of nanoparticles around the edges (Fig. 17g). The optical properties of the semiconducting 2H-polytype (e.g. photoluminescence of monolayers) were retained making these hybrids potentially interesting for printed optoelectronics.
By and large, the (multi)functional inks developed by combining TMDs with suitably designed molecules can express unique functionalities which are resulting from those determined by the individual components. Their processing and integration for device applications (e.g. in opto-electronics, photonics, sensing, etc.) can be carried out using up-scalable methods such as printing (ink-jet, roll-to-roll, etc.) and spray-coating, and the devices can be easily supported on flexible foils, opening new intriguing perspectives in the fields of flexible, foldable and wearable (opto)electronics.
6. Recent progress in the chemistry of TMDs “beyond MoWSeS”
Besides MoWSeS materials, other TMDs (group-6 tellurides, groups 4, 5, 7 and 10) possessing diverse chemical and physical properties are attracting nowadays a great deal of attention. In general, the electronic structures of TMDs are strongly dependent on the d-electron number of the transition metal.115 TMDs with many (group 7, 10) or few (group 4) d-electrons are prone to form d2sp3 hybridization, which results in the 1T-phase (or distorted 1T′) structure.115,416 In terms of electronic transport, they mostly exhibit semiconducting properties. In contrast, TMDs of the group 5 are prone to form d4sp hybridization with 1H structure and behave as narrow-band metals or semimetals with superconducting properties.115,416 By taking advantage of chemical functionalization strategies, diverse and novel properties of TMDs may emerge and be used for device applications.
The interaction between ferromagnetism (FM) and superconductivity (SC) is a cutting-edge research topic.417 It is well known that FM can destroy singlet correlations responsible for SC, and therefore it is quite rare to find materials that simultaneously exhibit both properties.418 Recently, the coexistence of FM and SC was observed in chemically-exfoliated 2H-NbSe2 (group 5) nanosheets upon chemical treatment with hydrazine molecules.114 Pristine NbSe2 is a superconducting yet non-magnetic material since the magnetic moment of Nb4+ (4d1 configuration) is quenched due to the Nb–Se hybridization. Zhu et al.114 found that the adsorption of reducing hydrazine molecules on the surface of NbSe2 (Fig. 18a) induces a structural distortion, i.e. elongated Nb–Se bonds and weaker Nb–Se interactions. Such a distortion leads to the emergence of a net magnetic moment with ordered spin behaviour resulting in ferromagnetic properties. Fig. 18b displays the magnetic hysteresis loop at 30 K, which provides evidence for the existence of FM in NbSe2.114 Moreover, the abrupt drop in electrical resistivity R occurring at temperature T ≤ 6 K (see Fig. 18c) confirms that the hydrazine treatment does not suppress the SC properties. Hence, the adsorption of hydrazine molecules represents an effective method to modulate the electrical – see also discussion in Section 2.1 – and magnetic properties of TMDs via chemical approaches.

Monolayer MoTe2 (group 6) has emerged as a promising phase-change material due to the small energy difference (∼31 meV)419 between the semiconducting 1H and metallic 1T′ polytypes,146,147 which makes it possible to trigger phase transitions via electrostatic doping.147 DFT calculations by Zhou et al.,419 which take into account spin–orbit coupling and vdW energy contributions, predict that molecules (e.g. H2, H2O, NH3, CO and N2) and atoms (e.g. Li, Na, K, O and Cl) adsorbed on the surface of the 2D sheet can stabilize the 1H and 1T′ phase, respectively. In this framework, new experimental studies are foreseen to explore the use of molecular approaches – for instance based on the “decoration” of the top and bottom surface (see Section 2.2) – to control the phase state and therefore also the electrical properties of ultrathin MoTe2.
Group-10 TMDs are gathering attention due to their thickness-dependent bandgap and high charge-carrier mobility.144,416 For instance, bulk PdSe2 and PtSe2 are semimetals whereas thin sheets of these materials (thickness ≤10 nm) display small semiconducting bandgaps.144,411 FETs based on ∼9 nm thick sheets of PdSe2 (group-10) show ambipolar transport characteristics with electron/hole field-effect mobility (μFE) up to ∼54/14 cm2 V−1 s−1 and Ion/Ioff ratio of ∼100.113 After a thermal annealing step under vacuum, which is commonly performed to remove environmental adsorbates (i.e. H2O and O2), the devices show unipolar n-type transport with μFE ≈ 216 cm2 V−1 s−1 and Ion/Ioff ≈ 103 (Fig. 18d). However, ambipolar as well as unipolar p-type transport has also been achieved via physisorption of acceptor molecules, namely F4-TCNQ (see Section 2.1). Electrical transport measurements in Fig. 18e demonstrate that the charge-carrier density in F4-TCNQ-treated PdSe2 FETs can be effectively modulated by controlling the amount of physisorbed molecules. By increasing the number of molecular dopants, the authors succeeded in achieving a unipolar p-type transport (red curve in Fig. 18e). Overall, they showed that the combination of thermal annealing and molecular physisorption doping is a promising route to control the charge-carrier polarity in narrow-bandgap semiconductors towards complementary logic devices and circuits.
Wan et al.420 prepared and characterized a promising n-type flexible thermoelectric material based on hybrid superlattices of semiconducting 1T-TiS2 (group 4) and organic cations. TiS2 single crystals were electrochemically intercalated with hexylammonium (HA) ions dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). After solvent exchange from DMSO to water the resulting compound – i.e. TiS2[(HA)0.08(H2O)0.22(DMSO)0.03] – showed a remarkably low in-plane thermal conductivity (∼0.12 W m−1 K−1), significantly lower than that of pristine TiS2 crystals (4.2 W m−1 K−1) where the layers interact via weak van der Waals forces. On the other hand, negatively-charged TiS2 layers and organic cations in the hybrid system are coupled via strong electrostatic interactions,420 which degrade the in-plane thermal conductivity due to phonon scattering. The combination of high electrical conductivity – typical of TiS2 – with the low thermal conductivity of the intercalated compound, allowed achieving a figure of merit ZT as high as ∼0.28 (T ≈ 373 K), which is close to that of the most promising p-type organic thermoelectric materials, i.e. poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS).
Finally, ultrathin ReSe2 (group 7) is an appealing material for optoelectronic applications due to its wide photoresponse range.101 The performance of photodetectors based on ReSe2 nanosheets has been significantly improved by n-type doping via physisorption of triphenylphosphine (PPh3) molecules.101 In comparison to their untreated counterparts, PPh3-treated ReSe2 FETs were found to display lower contact resistance, higher charge-carrier mobility, as well as enhanced photocurrent – by approximately a factor of 4 – under monochromatic light irradiation (λ ≈ 520 nm).
By taking advantage of the exotic properties of TMDs “beyond MoWSeS” and of their tunability via molecular chemistry methods, advanced optoelectronic, magnetic, as well as thermoelectric materials can be developed, paving the way towards novel applications based on molecule-TMD hybrids.
7. Conclusions and outlook
The large variety of materials/properties available in the TMD family – combined with the virtually-infinite number of functional molecular systems available through chemical synthesis – provides countless opportunities to engineer hybrid organic/inorganic nanomaterials with characteristics on demand for device applications. In such hybrids, new functionalities can be introduced in a chemically controlled manner by tailoring the interactions between molecules and ultrathin crystalline materials,199 thereby opening further possibilities for developing multifunctional/multiresponsive materials and devices. Hereafter, we will discuss these newly emerging research fronts, as well as the prospects and the challenges towards next-generation technologies based on molecule-TMD hybrid materials.
7.1 Hybrid van der Waals heterostructures
The molecular chemistry approaches to TMDs present several analogies to the quest for materials by design carried out by superimposing different inorganic 2D materials in the so-called vdW heterostructures (Fig. 19a).421,422 Molecules can be incorporated into these layered structures to generate novel hybrid materials in which unique molecular capabilities are combined with the ultra-high electrical performances of TMDs and other 2D materials. Towards this goal, molecular science offers a variety of opportunities that have not yet been fully explored.

So far, relatively few studies exploit the possibility to generate highly predictable self-assembled molecular monolayers on the surface of TMDs219,255,256,423,424 and impart them on-demand functions. Indeed, the molecular arrangement on TMD surfaces is determined by supramolecular interactions, which can be predicted and controlled by molecular design. Mastering molecular self-assembly allows incorporating specific functional groups (such as dopants) at pre-determined spatial locations, enabling a direct correlation between changes in the electrical characteristics of the devices and events taking place at the molecular scale. Moreover, such molecular chemistry approaches offer atomic-scale resolution that cannot be achieved with conventional lithographic techniques,425–427 and molecular monolayers self-align with respect to the crystalline direction of the underlying substrate giving rise to epitaxial growth.428,429 On graphene, this approach was exploited to induce controllable periodic potentials93 and demonstrate tunable doping.430
The same ultra-high control over the nanoscale molecular ordering can be achieved in the case of TMDs.81 Recently, Wang et al.255 demonstrated that oleamide generates analogous crystalline structures on the surface of different 2D materials, including several TMDs – MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WSe2 (Fig. 19b–d). Within the SAMs, oleamide molecules lie flat on the substrate surface, and intermolecular hydrogen bonds drive the formation of parallel rows, which are aligned to the crystallographic orientation of the 2D materials (Fig. 16e). In this regard, the growth is epitaxial and atomically precise, with single crystalline molecular domains extending over surface areas exceeding 0.5 μm × 0.5 μm (Fig. 16b–d).255 Whether the structural 1D anisotropy of the assembly induces anisotropy in the electronic properties of the underlying TMD remains an open question, which can only be answered by an investigation of electrical transport and optical characteristics of regions covered by a single crystalline molecular domain. In turn, this goal poses the challenge of maximizing the size of molecular crystalline domains, and of fabricating nanoscale devices that preserve the molecular monolayers. Finally, we highlight that molecular decoration affects not only the optoelectronic, but also the magnetic properties of TMDs,114,431 opening interesting avenues for spintronics based on TMD/molecules heterostructures. In this perspective, the ability to generate heterostructures with engineered properties can be exploited to build up a library of novel hybrid materials with on-demand properties.
7.2 Multifunctional materials and devices
Combining molecular systems with ultrathin TMDs allows not only to control the charge-carrier doping of 2D semiconductors but also to modulate their optical, thermal and sensing properties in hybrid systems. Such an approach makes it also possible to impart a multifunctional/multiresponsive nature to 2D TMDs that can be conveniently exploited for developing multifunctional (opto)electronic devices, which can be controlled with multiple independent stimuli. For instance, by making use of the different molecular chemistry methods discussed in this review, 2D sheets of TMDs could be functionalized with molecules carrying photochromic,432–434 magneto-responsive435 and electrochemically-switchable436,437 moieties. External stimuli, such as heat, light, magnetic fields and electrochemical signals, can then be used to trigger changes in the structures/properties of the molecules interfacing the ultrathin sheets. Thanks to their ultimately-large surface to volume ratio, ultrathin TMDs are expected to respond to such changes with variations in their electrical, optical and magnetic characteristics. One interesting example has been recently provided by Datta et al.,431 who developed FETs based on monolayer MoS2 sheets “decorated” on their top surface with magnetic molecules, such as quinoidal dithienyl perylenequinodimethane (QDTP). The latter undergo a spin transition from a singlet to a triplet state with increasing temperature above ∼370 K. This spin-state switch could be electrically transduced by the MoS2 sheet, which displayed an increase in the free electron density (n-type doping) and a strong enhancement in magnetoconductance (∼100%) above the magnetic transition temperature. This work demonstrated that the electrical/magnetic properties of monolayer MoS2 could be dynamically modified through the interaction with switchable molecular systems. In the next years, further research is envisioned towards multifunctional/multiresponsive materials and devices based on combinations of ultrathin TMDs and molecular switches.
7.3 Next challenges
In order to take full advantage of TMD-molecule hybrids in technological applications, several critical challenges have to be addressed. Besides the aforementioned requirement to control/enlarge the size of physisorbed molecular crystal domains far beyond micrometre-scale areas (e.g.Fig. 16b–d), an important task towards hybrid TMD-molecule (opto)electronics consists in developing suitable techniques (e.g. encapsulation) to prevent desorption or decomposition of molecules during device operation (Section 2.1). Towards the implementation of practical device applications with doping controlled via molecular chemistry methods, it is also of paramount importance to achieve a systematic control over the degree of functionalization in both solution-processed and substrate-supported 2D sheets. The latter should be carefully quantified through multiple experimental techniques and must be systematically controlled, especially in the case of optoelectronic devices and sensing technologies, where uniform and reproducible optical, electronic and sensing properties must be achieved across the entire active material's surface. However, such requirements might not be so stringent for multifunctional foams and composites,438 or for biomedical applications,198 which could be the first areas where hybrid molecule-TMDs could find practical applications. Towards the improvement of the quality of our lives, in the forthcoming years the development of structurally defined, novel hybrid materials based on TMDs and suitably designed molecules, shall open a new technological era relying on portable, flexible and foldable multiresponsive (opto)electronic devices for health and environmental monitoring. The full exploitation of the infinite options offered by molecular science in terms of structural and functional diversities shall soon yield to the emergence of new, disruptive and exotic technologies based on TMD hybrids.

 	Fig. 14  Overview of functionalization strategies for TMDs in the liquid phase based on chemically exfoliated (CE-MX2) and liquid phase exfoliated (LPE-MX2) nanosheets. In addition to physisorption, different approaches for chemisorption exist. These can be classified as covalent (involving X–C bonds), coordinative (involving chalcogens as ligands) and defect functionalization. Defects such as chalcogen vacancies can also be used for coordination chemistry involving dative bonds with nucleophiles.

 	Fig. 15  Schematic of reaction pathways to achieve functionalization via chemisorption. (a) Pathways building on chemical exfoliation via intercalation with n-butyllithium. This process yields negatively charged MX2 nanosheets in the 1T/1T′ polytype which can be further derivatized via (i) coordination of thiols to chalcogen vacancy sites (defect functionalization), (ii) reductive covalent functionalization with electrophiles such as organohalides or diazonium salts, or (iii) physisorption of metal nanoparticles. (b) Pathways building on liquid phase exfoliation in appropriate solvents or aqueous surfactants. This strategy yields few-layered nanosheets of the semiconducting 2H-polytype. These can be functionalized by (i) coordination of electron donors (dithiolanes or carboxylic acids) to sulfur deficient edges, (ii) coordination to metal complexes using the chalcogen as ligand, or (iii) nanoparticles covalently bound to nanosheet edges.
