Herein, CuS NPs capped with citrate (cit-CuS NPs) were prepared by a solution method. The chiral enantiomers L-CuS and D-CuS NPs were obtained by ligand exchange with cysteine (Cys). New mirrored signals in the UV and visible range were observed in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of samples, indicating that the chirality of Cys was successfully transferred to the CuS NPs.

Introduction
One of the most fascinating occurrences in the natural world is chirality.1 A chiral molecule is one that has two mirror-image forms, which can be described as non-superimposable enantiomers. Just like a human's hands, which mirror each other, the left hand cannot overlap with the right hand. Enantiomers which have identical physical properties will rotate the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light in different directions. Therefore, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, a technique for measurement of the difference in the absorption of left and right circularly polarized light in optically active materials, can be used directly to study chiral activity.2 Since Pasteur discovered the enantiomers of tartaric acid, the study of chiral structures has never stopped. Especially after the ‘thalidomide incident’ which indicates the strong dependence of biological activity such as intracellular uptake, enzymatic activity and toxicity on the enantiomeric form, great attention has been paid on the study of chirality.3 After three scientists won the Nobel Prize for chiral synthesis, chiral catalytic hydrogenation and chiral catalytic oxidation in 2001,4 the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was again awarded to chiral asymmetric catalysis in 2021,5 demonstrating the extraordinary significance and achievements made in chiral research. In the recent years, research on chiral inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) has been rapidly expanding, due to their potential applications in asymmetric catalysis, enantiomeric separation, chiral sensing, cytotoxicity mediation, circular polarization light emitting devices and spintronics.2 Chiral activity of inorganic NPs might be induced by various methods in which ligand-induced chirality is one of the most common methods. The chiral activity in such inorganic NPs is believed to be related to the interaction of NPs with chiral ligands, e.g. cysteine (Cys) or penicillamine (Pen). Inorganic NPs have size- and shape-dependent physical and chemical properties, which makes them more flexible and uncomplicated to realize inorganic NPs with controllable optical properties.6–10 To date, ligand-induced chiral NPs including CuO,11 CdS,12 HgS13 and CdSe14 have been prepared and their chiroptical properties have been widely investigated as well.
As an important metal sulfide, copper sulfide (CuS) has good electrical and optical properties, as well as excellent physical and chemical stability, and is widely used in many fields such as photothermal conversion, photocatalysis, nano-switches and solar cell devices.15,16 Thereby, chiral CuS NPs might have potential applications in biology, chemistry and physics. C. Hao's group reported chiral Cu2−xS quantum dots (QDs) with a high anisotropy factor and intense chiroptical activity which originated from the chiral Pen ligands through chirality transfer. These chiral QDs showed photocatalytic activity in protein cleavage under circularly polarized (CP) light irradiation.17 Using photothermal agents to convert near infrared (NIR) light energy into heat is a promising research area. CuS is one of the representative photothermal agents because of its effective plasmon absorption in the NIR region and high photothermal conversion efficiency. Chiral Cys-MoO3−x NPs prepared by Y. Li et al. exhibited high photothermal efficiency under circularly polarized light illumination.18 However, to the best of our knowledge, no publications are available on the preparation and photothermal activity of chiral CuS nanomaterials.
Herein, chiral CuS NPs were prepared through chirality transfer from chiral cysteine (Cys) molecules to CuS NPs via a ligand-exchange process. Citrate-capped CuS (cit-CuS) NPs were firstly prepared at 90 °C. Then, chiral Cys was employed to construct chiral enantiomers L-CuS and D-CuS NPs. The photothermal activity of these enantiomers were evaluated under exposure to linearly polarized light (LPL), left-circularly-polarized light (LCPL) and right-circularly-polarized light (RCPL), respectively. It was observed that these chiral CuS NPs showed a rapid photothermal response and the maximum photothermal conversion efficiency reached up to 59.15% for D-CuS NPs under RCPL irradiation.
Experimental section
Materials
Copper(II) chloride (CuCl2·2H2O), sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O), sodium citrate (C6H5Na3O7, Na3cit), L-cysteine (C3H7NO2S) and D-cysteine (C3H7NO2S) were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification.
Preparation of cit-CuS NPs
The typical synthesis method is in accordance with Gao's method.19 Firstly, 0.252 mmol of CuCl2·2H2O and 0.154 mmol of sodium citrate were dissolved in 200 mL of ultrapure (UP) water and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. 200 μL of Na2S·9H2O (3.100 mmol mL−1) aqueous solution was then added with stirring for 5 min. After that, the precursor was transferred to a 90 °C oil bath and maintained at 90 °C for 15 min. A dark-green aqueous solution containing cit-CuS NPs was finally obtained.
Preparation of chiral CuS NPs
Chiral CuS (L- or D-CuS) NPs were obtained by adding different amounts (0.006, 0.030, 0.042 and 0.054 mmol) of chiral Cys to 12 mL as-prepared cit-CuS aqueous solution, respectively. Afterwards, ultrasonic treatment was applied to help the ligand-exchange reaction between achiral citrate and chiral Cys molecules. After 5 min of sonication, the mixture was kept in the dark for 24 h. After purification via centrifugation to remove precipitates (if any), L-/D-CuS NPs were re-dispersed in an equal volume (12 mL) of UP water to maintain the same concentration. The obtained chiral CuS aqueous solutions are named as 0.006-, 0.030-, 0.042- and 0.054-L-/D-CuS according to the added amount of Cys, respectively.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a PANalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer using a Cu target as the radiation source (λ = 1.54060 Å). A confocal Raman scattering system with a 532 nm laser as a scattering source was employed to measure the Raman spectra of samples. The morphology was observed on an FEI F20 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operating at 200 kV. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were conducted on a JASCO J-1500 CD spectrometer. All optical measurements were performed at room temperature under ambient conditions.
Photothermal characterization
In the photothermal characterization, an 808 nm laser (LSR808H, Q-BAIHE, Wuhan, China) was used as the irradiation source. LPL was obtained by inserting a polarizer between the laser and sample, while CPL was realized through a quarter wave plate added after the polarizer. The aqueous solution of NPs was irradiated for 600 s and then cooled down to room temperature naturally. The power density of irradiation was maintained to be 1.0 W cm−2. For comparison, photothermal characterization of UP water with the same volume was carried out as well. The temperature of samples was recorded using an infrared imaging device every 20 s. The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) was calculated according to the following formula:20  where ΔTmax and ΔTwater represent the temperature increase of the aqueous solution of NPs and water after 600 s of irradiation, respectively; I is the laser power and A808 is the absorbance of the sample at 808 nm. The value of hs is determined based on a dimensionless driving force temperature (θ) and a time constant (τ) for heat transfer from the system:    t = −τlnθHere, ΔT is the difference between the real-time temperature and room temperature, m is the mass of the solution and C is the specific heat capacity of water.
Results and discussion
The XRD pattern of the cit-CuS sample presented in Fig. 1a shows the characteristic diffraction from the (102), (103) and (110) planes of hexagonal CuS (JCPDS 06-0464) with the space group P63/mmc. From the Raman scattering spectrum shown in Fig. 1b, the characteristic peaks from Cu–S (265 cm−1) and S–S (475 cm−1) vibration modes can be observed, indicating the successful synthesis of CuS.21 No other peaks from impurities were detected. The TEM image in Fig. 1c shows the spherical morphology of cit-CuS NPs with an average crystal size of about 20 nm. The UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. 1d) reveals two absorption maxima: one is located at 259 nm which can be assigned to band edge absorption and another is in the near infrared (NIR) region (near 800 nm) which is from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption of covellite CuS,22 suggesting that the prepared copper sulfide was CuS as well.

In order to understand the chirality transfer from Cys molecules to CuS NPs, the absorption-based chiroptical activity of L/D-CuS NPs prepared by adding different amounts of L/D-Cys was investigated. As shown in Fig. 2b, when the amount of Cys added is less than 0.030 mmol, e.g. 0.006 mmol, both L- and D-CuS NPs showed no obvious CD signals in the whole wavelength range although absorption can be observed in both UV and NIR regions. The CD and absorption spectra of pristine L- and D-Cys are presented in Fig. 2a for comparison. The CD spectra of pristine L- and D-Cys showed characteristic peaks at around 206 nm which is the same as previously reported23 and in accordance with the UV-vis absorption. As the amount of Cys attached to CuS NPs reached up to 0.030 mmol, the as-prepared L- and D-Cys-CuS NPs exhibited mirrored CD signals. Three CD peaks located at 208 nm, 246 nm and 610 nm can be observed. The original peak at 206 nm from Cys shifted to 208 nm and its intensity was greatly attenuated as shown in Fig. 2b. The new CD peak at 246 nm for the NPs might be due to the interaction between L-/D-Cys and the surface of CuS NPs,24 which indicates that the chirality was successfully transferred from Cys to CuS NPs. It is apparent from Fig. 2c that the spectral line shape of the mirrored signals at around 610 nm in the CD spectra of the Cys–CuS enantiomers shows the zero-crossing point located at about 734 nm which corresponds to the LSPR absorption. Therefore, the CD signal in the range of 500 to 750 nm may result from the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) effect as well as LSPR in CuS NPs.25

The anisotropic CD factor (gabs) which is a dimensionless quantity was calculated by the formula:26  The g-factor spectra of samples are shown in Fig. 3. And the maxima of |gabs| together with the corresponding wavelength for different amounts of Cys attached to CuS NPs are summarized in Table 1. The largest g-factor value is determined to be up to 10−3 for 0.0042-L-CuS NPs at about 598.6 nm and for 0.054-D-CuS at about 207.9 nm, which is apparently higher than those of chiral ligand-capped NPs.26

The photothermal performance of the samples was characterized under LPL, LCPL and RCPL irradiation. The mechanism for the photothermal effects of CuS could be attributed to the LSPR induced optical absorption which can generate considerable heat.27 Therefore, it is believed that the chiral CuS NPs could show different photothermal performances under LCPL and RCPL irradiation due to their strong chiroptical activity. Biological tissue is difficult to penetrate by visible light due to scattering and absorption, while NIR radiation can penetrate deeper into biological tissue, allowing subcutaneous tumor therapy. Considering the asymmetrical absorption of these chiral CuS NPs near 800 nm and actual application requirements, we chose a light source with a wavelength of 808 nm for photothermal tests. A CPL generator was made using an 808 nm CW laser, polarizer and quarter wavelength plate (QWP), as illustrated in Fig. 4. All the as-prepared L/D-CuS NPs (with the amount of Cys attached ≥ 0.030 mmol) demonstrated an obvious photo-induced increase of temperature and the same temperature-rise profile. Therefore, in the following analysis of photothermal activity, the 0.042-L/D-CuS samples which had the highest g-factor value at about 598.6 nm are chosen as a representative for all chiral CuS NPs.

As shown in Fig. 5, both L/D-CuS NPs showed an immediate response and rapid heating when exposed to either LPL or CPL with a wavelength of 808 nm. The photothermal response of UP water was characterized under the same conditions for comparison. The UP water exhibited an increase of only 2.6 °C in temperature after irradiation for 600 s. The typical plots of temperature versus time for 0.042-L-CuS are shown in Fig. 5a. After exposure to LPL, LCPL and RCPL for 600 s, the temperature increase of 0.042-L-CuS was 22.4 °C, 25.3 °C and 23.2 °C, respectively. The time constants (τ) for heat transfer from the system were calculated by applying the linearized energy balance to temperature versus time data from the cooling period as presented in Fig. 5a, which is shown in Fig. 5b. According to the time constants, the photothermal conversion efficiencies of 0.042-L-CuS under LPL, LCPL and RCPL were determined to be 41.38%, 49.80% and 48.51%, respectively. Obviously, 0.042-L-CuS showed a higher photothermal efficiency under LCPL than under LPL and RCPL. The characteristic plots of the photothermal effect for 0.042-D-CuS are shown in Fig. 5c and d, and show that after exposure to LPL, LCPL and RCPL for 600 s, the temperature increase of 0.042-D-CuS was 23.4 °C, 25 °C and 25.2 °C, respectively. The photothermal efficiencies were obtained as 56.52%, 54.18% and 59.15% under LPL, LCPL and RCPL, respectively. Evidently, 0.042-D-CuS showed a higher photothermal efficiency under RCPL than under LPL and LCPL. The different photothermal performances of chiral CuS under CPL can be attributed to the different absorption of L- and D-CuS for LCPL and RCPL. The time constant τ and photothermal efficiency η of 0.042-L/D-CuS NPs under LPL and CPL are summarized in Table 2. The photothermal efficiencies of these chiral CuS NPs is much higher than the reported values for a silver-doped CuS nanoplatform (37.8%)20 and Prussian blue/CuS Janus nanostructure (43.8%).28 A possible reason for the high photothermal efficiency is that the as-prepared chiral CuS NPs have minimal optical energy scattering or re-emitting through luminescence, leading to high conversion of light into heat.29 The higher photothermal efficiencies of D/L-CuS NPs under RCPL/LCPL are believed to be due to the higher absorbance of RCPL/LCPL for D/L-CuS NPs, respectively.

The chiroptical properties and different photothermal responses of L/D-CuS NPs indicated that chirality was successfully transferred from Cys molecules to CuS NPs through the ligand-exchange process. Therefore, a plausible mechanism for the formation of chiral CuS NPs is proposed and the schematic is shown in Fig. 6. Firstly, Cu2+–cit3− complexes would be formed during the preparation of the Cu-precursor. The formation of Cu2+–cit3− complexes can monitor the concentration of free Cu2+ in the reaction solution, which will control the nucleation and growth speed.30 As the S-precursor is added, free Cu2+ in the reaction solution will react with S2− to form stable CuS nuclei. As growth continues and the free Cu2+ concentration decreases, Cu2+ will be released from the Cu2+–cit3− complexes. Therefore, it is believed that the negative cit3− attached on the surface of CuS nuclei plays an important role which can slow down the growth speed to ensure the stability and small size of CuS NPs.31,32 Finally, spherical and water-dispersible cit-CuS NPs are prepared successfully. When chiral Cys is added in cit-CuS NP solution, the ligand-exchange reaction would progress under appropriate conditions (such as ultrasonic treatment and aging in the dark). Due to the thiol group in the Cys molecule, a strong Cu–S bond can be formed, which will replace the existing interaction between the surface of CuS NPs and negative cit3−.33 Consequently, the redshift and attenuation of the original CD peak from Cys as well as the new CD peak at 246 nm for chiral CuS NPs are believed to be due to the interaction between the NP surface and Cys molecules.24 Meanwhile, the CD peaks of L/D-CuS located at 500–750 nm are believed to be induced by the MLCT effect and LSPR in CuS. The MLCT effect was observed in some chiral NPs such as WO3−x34 and MoO3−x25 capped with amino acids, and induces an unusual chiroelectronic band at the visible region and a chiroplasmonic signal at the NIR region. Due to the strong Cu–S bond between Cu2+ in CuS and S2− in Cys, the highest anisotropic g-factor of the Cys–CuS system can reach 1 × 10−3.

Conclusion
Cit-capped CuS NPs were prepared by a solution method, and chiral CuS NPs were further prepared by a ligand-exchange process. These chiral CuS NPs showed a strong chiroptical response in the UV and visible range, and the maximum |gabs| can reach 10−3 due to the strong Cu–S bond between Cu2+ in CuS and S2− in Cys. In the investigation of photothermal performance for chiral CuS, L-CuS showed a higher photothermal efficiency (49.80%) under LCPL irradiation, while D-CuS showed a higher photothermal efficiency (59.15%) under RCPL irradiation. These results showed that chirality was successfully transferred from Cys molecules to CuS NPs, and the chiroptical activity of chiral CuS NPs was derived from the MLCT effect and LSPR in CuS. The growth mechanism of chiral CuS NPs was also proposed and indicates that Na3cit plays an important role. This work puts forward profound insights into the formation mechanism of chiral CuS NPs, and provides a new strategy for photothermal treatment of chiral NPs.
