    , Accepted 17th September 2009First published on 13th October 2009AbstractPristine and shorted multi-walled carbon nanotubes (pMWCNT and sMWCNT, respectively) non-covalently modified with a block copolymer (poly[sodium (2-sulfamate-3-carboxylate) isoprene-b-styrene]—abbreviated as CSI) are used for the formation of CdS semiconductor nanohybrids. The CdS nanoparticles are preferentially localized on the surface of the nanotubes due to specific interactions with the polymer chains. In these nanohybrid materials photoinduced electron transfer phenomena are found to occur from the photoexcited CdS nanoparticles to the nanotubes as evidenced by the efficient fluorescence emission quenching of CdS nanoparticles. Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy sheds light on the transient species formed by charge separation, namely (pMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ and (sMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+. The MWCNT/CSI/CdS nanohybrid materials are deposited onto ITO electrodes by the drop-casting method. The ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS electrode exhibit an incident photon to photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) of 7% at an applied bias of +0.2 V vs.SCE in a standard three-compartment electrochemical cell. Direct electron injection from the reduced nanotubes to ITO electrode after the photoinduced charge separation is responsible for the photocurrent generation.
Introduction

Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are excellent candidates for building energy conversion devices due to their unique electronic structure, high conductivity and large aspect ratio.1–11 In recent studies where CNT and photo- and/or electron-active organic materials are combined forming nanosized hybrids, issues concerning solubility,12 absorption cross section-solar light harvesting13–16 as well as fine-tuning the charge carrier mobilities17–20 have been advanced or even overcome. Thus, the suitability of CNT in photovoltaics, where electron donor–acceptor interactions play a major and important role, is highlighted.21–30 Additionally, the photoelectrochemical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes and of cup-stacked carbon nanotube films cast on conducting glass electrodes have also been reported.31–37
On the other hand, the formation of nanoscaled heterostructures based on the combination of CNT with inorganic species, potentially useful in optoelectronic devices, solar energy converters and photocatalysis, is not that rich.38,39 Moreover, there are a limited number of reported protocols for attaching metal nanoparticles onto CNT, including electrochemical deposition,40 electroless deposition with and without the aid of reducing agents,41 physical/chemical deposition onto CNT with and without surface activation42–44 and templated by dendron-tethered onto CNT.45
Semiconductor nanoparticles possessing tunable and large band-gaps (such as CdSe, CdSe@ZnS, CdS, and TiO2) can be combined with CNT forming heterostructures.46–49 Interestingly, CNT-CdTe nanohybrids were systematically devised and tested as donor–acceptor nanohybrids, either in condensed media or as integrative components at electrode surfaces. The preparation of such hybrids was accomplished upon linking CNT with thioglycolic acid-capped CdTe through strong electrostatic interactions.50 As another example, deposition of CdS on CNT was achieved in suspensions and thin films, where fast electron transfer from the photoexcited CdS to CNT was shown to occur.51 In a very recent report, the framework of CNT was coated with pyrene/CdSe nanoparticles and effective charge transfer from the pyrene/CdSe nanoparticles to CNT was found.52 Electrons are transported along the CNT axis, while positive charges hop along the CdS nanoparticles framework.
Previously, we reported on the preparation of water soluble CNT/amphiphilic block copolymer (i.e. the block polyelectrolyte poly[sodium (2-sulfamate-3-carboxylate) isoprene-b-styrene]—abbreviated as CSI) nanoensembles, as templates for the in-situ synthesis of semiconductor CdS quantum dots.53 The aqueous solubilization of CNT with the block polyelectrolyte led to the formation of supramolecular assemblies in the form of block copolymer hemi-micelles onto the framework of CNT. Moreover, with the aid of viscosity measurements it was shown that the polyelectrolyte effect, originating from the block copolymer chemical nature, was preserved in the nanoensemble.54 Preliminary experiments based on steady-state electronic absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy revealed the first hints of electronic communication between the semiconductor CdS quantum dots and the CNT. Herein, we present a detailed photophysical study of this ensemble, namely CNT/CSI/CdS, examining photoinduced electron transfer phenomena between CdS and CNT.
In the present study, two classes of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (abbreviated as MWCNT), in which the presence of numerous concentric graphene cylinders provides different acceptor levels, in the forms of pristine (long) and short MWNT (abbreviated as pMWCNT and sMWCNT, respectively) were utilized. For comparison purposes, the CdS nanoparticles were also synthesized in the absence of CNT, that is in the presence of only the block copolymer. Moreover, the photoelectrochemical behaviour of sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and pMWCNT/CSI/CdS fabricated onto ITO electrode was investigated.
Experimental
General
The pMWCNT (width 20–30 nm) and sMWCNT (length < 500 nm and width 20–30 nm) were obtained from Nanostructured & Amorphous Materials Inc. (http://www.nanoamor.com) and used as received. All solvents and chemicals were of reagent grade quality, obtained commercially and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Steady-state absorption spectra in the Vis and NIR regions were measured on a JACSO-V570-DS spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra were measured on a Shimadzu RF-5300PC spectro-fluorophotometer with a photomultiplier tube sensitive in the Vis-NIR region. All experiments were performed at room temperature. The synthesis of CNT/CSI/CdS was previously described.53,54 In brief, the amphiphilic block copolymer poly[sodium (2-sulfamate-3-carboxylate) isoprene-b-styrene] (CSI) was co-dissolved with the nanotubes (either pMWCNT or sMWCNT) under sonication in water, leading to a stable black solution, from which the free (not anchored) polymer chains in water were filtered off. The resulting solid was re-dissolved in water, to which cadmium acetate was added. The cadmium cations are located at the periphery of the CSI-modified nanotubes due to electrostatic interactions with the anionic moieties of the polymeric chains. Subsequently, the appropriate amount of thioacetamide was inserted into the solution and the temperature was raised to 80 °C, where thioacetamide decomposition occurred with the simultaneous in-situ generation of sulfur anions. Under these conditions the synthesis of CdS nanoparticles takes place at the periphery of the nanotubes, where the cadmium cations are also located. The final products were stored and studied in aqueous solution at room temperature. The same protocol was also used for the synthesis of CdS in the absence of CNT, using the aqueous block polymer micellar solution instead of the nanotube suspension. In the latter case, 5 mL of an aqueous polymer solution was prepared (5 × 10−4 g/mL) by adding the appropriate amount of CSI directly in water. Subsequently, aqueous cadmium acetate was added (0.33 mL, 7.2 × 10−6 M) and the solution was left to stand for 1.5 h. Finally, a small amount of thioacetamide was added and the temperature was raised to 80 °C.

Preparation of CNT/CSI/CdS films. 
An appropriate volume (∼1mL) of sMWCNT/CSI/CdS (or pMWCNT/CSI/CdS) suspension was simply deposited onto ITO electrodes (Sanyo Vacuum Industries Co., Ltd.) by the drop-casting method. The surface area was 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm. The ITO electrodes coated with sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and pMWCNT/CSI/CdS are referred to as ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and ITO/pMWCNT/CSI/CdS respectively.


Photoelectrochemical measurements. 
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a three-compartment cell using a potentiostat, employing a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE),31,33,51 a working electrode and a Pt wire gauze counter electrode. This configuration allowed us to carry out photocurrent measurements under electrochemical bias. An IviumStat (potentiostat) or KEITHLEY 2400 was used for recording I-V characteristics and photocurrent generation density under an AM1.5 simulated light source (OTENTO-SUN II, Bunkoh-Keiki Co., LTD). The electrolyte was 0.1 M aqueous Na2S. In the case of IPCE measurement, a monochromator (SM-25, Bunkoh-Keiki Co., LTD) was introduced into the path of the excitation beam (300 W xenon lamp, Bunkoh-Keiki Co., LTD) for the selected wavelength. The lamp intensity at each wavelength was determined using a Si photodiode (Hamamatsu Photonics S1337-1010BQ) and corrected.


Fluorescence lifetime measurements. 
Time-resolved fluorescence spectra were measured by a single-photon counting method using the second harmonic generation (SHG, 400 nm) of a Ti:sapphire laser [Spectra-physics, Tsunami 3950-L2S, 1.5 ps full width at half-maximum (fwhm)] and a streak scope (Hamamatsu Photonics, C4334-01) equipped with a polychromator (Action Research, SpectraPro 150) as an excitation source and a detector, respectively.


Nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. 
Nanosecond transient absorption spectra in the visible and NIR regions were measured by laser flash photolysis; 355 nm light from a Nd:YAG laser was used as the excitation source and Si- and Ge-avalanche-photodiode modules were used for detecting the monitoring light from a pulsed Xe lamp.

Results and discussion
The CdS nanoparticles were formed at the periphery of co-polymer chains covering CNT, as illustrated in Scheme 1. It is worth mentioning that CSI block copolymer was chosen and used both for the solubilization and stability of the system and for offering the anionic sites around the nanotubes surface for further functionalization with precursor cadmium cationic species.53,54 The synthesis of CdS nanoparticles was realized following a two-step protocol. In the first step, the addition of Cd cations takes place—in this context, the cations are attracted by the anions of the copolymer chains, which are adsorbed on the surface of the CNT. Subsequently, in the second step, thioacetamide is added to transform the Cd cations into CdS nanoparticles, also located on the surface of the CNT.

The synthesis of the CdS nanoparticles in the absence of CNT was also performed in a solution of the block copolymer. In this case, the hydrophobic polystyrene blocks tend to self assemble in the micellar core, while the polyelectrolyte poly[sodium (2-sulfamate-3-carboxylate) isoprene] blocks are extended to the solution forming the micellar corona, as evidenced by dynamic light scattering.52 Therefore, the CdS nanoparticles are located within the corona of the block copolymer micelles (Scheme 1c).

Electronic absorption spectroscopy was initially employed in order to identify the existence of the CdS nanoparticles and to determine their diameter. The absorption spectra of the CdS nanoparticles formed at the surface of pMWCNT and sMWCNT (pMWCNT/CSI/CdS and sMWCNT/CSI/CdS, respectively), as well as on the polyelectrolyte block of the copolymer (CSI/CdS) are given in Fig. 1. In the case of CSI/CdS, the success of the in-situ formation of CdS is unambiguously verified by the presence of a shoulder at about 485 nm. Although this band is appreciably blue shifted from the characteristic absorption at 520 nm of macrocrystalline CdS,53 this is reasonable taking the size quantization effects into consideration.53 Additionally, for the pMWCNT/CSI/CdS and sMWCNT/CSI/CdS hybrids, the absorption shoulder near at 485 nm was broadened (i.e.spectra (a) and (b) in Fig. 1), as compared with the absorption in the absence of nanotubes (i.e.spectrum (c) in Fig. 1), suggesting a considerable interaction of the CdS nanoparticles with the nanotubes.

Furthermore, the formation of the described nanohybrid was established based on diverse and complementary spectroscopic techniques (i.e. Raman, EDX, ATR-IR) and thermal analysis (TGA), as well as transmission electron microscopy.54,55
Extending the investigation of electronic interactions of CdS nanoparticles with CNT in the excited state, fluorescence emission spectroscopy was applied as a powerful technique. The strong fluorescence emission of the CSI/CdS nanoparticles (in the absence of CNT but stabilized with the CSI block copolymer) observed at 520 nm upon excitation at 400 nm is almost quantitatively quenched by either pMWCNT or sMWCNT (Fig. 2). Evidently, the effective emission quenching of CdS in MWCNT/CSI/CdS nanohybrids suggests sufficient electronic communication between the two species, namely the excited singlet states of CdS (1(CdS)*) and pMWCNT or sMWCNT; that is, the CdS nanoparticles are located quite near the surface of the MWCNT.
 Fig. 2  Steady-state fluorescence spectra of (a) sMWCNT/CSI/CdS, (b) pMWCNT/CSI/CdS and (c) CSI/CdS, obtained upon excitation at 400 nm in water. 
In the following step, and in order to further prove and support electronic communication between CdS and CNT, the photoinduced dynamics of the CNT/CSI/CdS nanohybrid excited state were investigated by time-resolved spectroscopy techniques. The time-resolved fluorescence emission spectra of CdS, measured with a streak-scope, on combining with pico-second laser light pulses are presented in Fig. 3. The CdS nanoparticles in pMWCNT/CSI/CdS and sMWCNT/CSI/CdS hybrid materials exhibited less intense fluorescence with longer wavelength shifts of peak positions (15–20 nm) in comparison with the CSI/CdS nanoparticles (i.e. in the absence of the nanotubes), suggesting that strong electronic interaction of 1(CdS)* with CNT occurs after photoexcitation of the hybrid material. From the fluorescence time-profiles in Fig. 3 (inset), the fluorescence lifetimes of the excited CdS in the pMWCNT/CSI/CdS and sMWCNT/CSI/CdS nanohybrids were evaluated to be 135 ps and 72 ps, respectively. These values are significantly shorter than the lifetime of CSI/CdS (2180 ps), thus supporting the efficient emission quenching of CdS by the nanotubes in the CNT/CSI/CdS nanohybrids, as observed in the fluorescence-intensity quenching in the steady-state spectra (cf.Fig. 2) and the appreciable red-shift of the fluorescence peak (cf.Fig. 3).

Thus, the fluorescence lifetimes (τf), quenching rate constants (kSq) and quantum yields (ΦSq) for sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and pMWCNT/CSI/CdS materials are summarized in Table 1. The kSq and ΦSq for pMWCNT/CSI/CdS and sMWCNT/CSI/CdS were evaluated as 0.7 × 1010 s−1 and 0.94 and 1.3 × 1010 s−1 and 0.97, respectively. At this stage, energy transfer and charge separation can be considered as results of this fluorescence quenching. Higher quenching efficiency for sMWCNT/CSI/CdS compared with that for pMWCNT/CSI/CdS is probably due to closer contact of CdS nanoparticles to sMWCNT than that to pMWCNT.

In order to shed light on the processes after the photoexcitation of sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and pMWCNT/CSI/CdS, steady-state absorption measurements were conducted upon addition of methyl viologen dication (MV2+) and 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydro-nicotinamide (BNAH) as an electron mediator and a sacrificial hole-shifter, respectively. Importantly, during photolysis at 355 nm, accumulation of MV˙+ was observed for both sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and pMWCNT/CSI/CdS hybrid materials as shown in Fig. 4. Therefore, in combination with the fluorescence quenching of CdS in the MWCNT/CSI/CdS hybrid materials, it is revealed that the charge-separation event takes place from the singlet-excited state of 1(CdS)* to MWCNT/CSI, thus generating a radical ion pair (RIP) with a hole due to the one electron oxidation of CdS, referred to as CdS˙+, and an electron in MWCNT, referred to as MWCNT˙−, (MWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+. From (MWCNT)˙−, an electron migrates to MV2+, generating electron-rich MV˙+. A hole from CdS˙+ shifts to BNAH, while an increase of the BNAH concentration enhances the maximum MV˙+ concentration, thus indicating that the hole-shifting reagent indeed assists the accumulation of MV˙+ (Fig. 4), due to retardation of the charge-recombination process. Importantly, in controlled measurements conducted for CSI/CdS, in the absence of nanotubes, such MV˙+ accumulation was not observed (see ESI,† Fig. S1). Furthermore, it is notable that the maximum MV˙+ concentration for sMWCNT/CSI/CdS was higher than that of pMWCNT/CSI/CdS by a factor of ca. 1.2, as a result of the faster rate for charge-separation and higher efficiency for the generation of (sMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+via the photoexcited sMWCNT/CSI/CdS.

Each maximal absorbance is depicted after 20 times laser light irradiation. 
The electrochemistry of CNT/CSI/CdS nanohybrids was examined by means of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). In Fig. 5 the DPV of sMWCNT/CSI/CdS obtained in aqueous solution is shown; for other samples, see ESI,† Fig. S2. Overall, the following points should be highlighted: (i) the CdS quantum dots at the proximity of MWCNT can be more easily stabilized as compared to that of CSI/CdS, because the oxidation potential (EOx) of CdS in the CNT/CSI/CdS nanohybrid was found to be anodically shifted to 0.194 V (for pMWCNT) and 0.188 V (for sMWCNTs) vs.Ag/AgCl, as compared to that of the free CSI/CdS (0.13 V). This anodic shift implies that significant electronic interactions between CdS and MWCNT decrease the electron-donation ability of CdS; (ii) the wide peaks at the negative potential area of −0.330 V and −0.388 for sMWCNT and pMWCNT, respectively, are attributed to the reduction (ERed) of the nanotubes, since the nanoparticles cannot be reduced at this potential range.14 The free energy changes for the RIP (ΔGRIP) (pMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ and (sMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+, via a photoinduced charge-separation process, were calculated to be 0.58 eV and 0.52 eV, respectively, as the difference between the EOx of CdS and the ERed of CNT, respectively.
 Fig. 5  
Differential pulse voltammogram of sMWCNT/CSI/CdS obtained in aqueous solution (scan rate: 100 mV/sec). 
The lowest excited singlet state of CdS was evaluated to be 2.48 eV (0–0 transition band), from which the negative free energy changes for the charge separation (ΔGCS) via1(CdS)* of (pMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ and (sMWNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ are calculated to be −1.90 eV and −2.00 eV, respectively. This confirms a more exothermic formation process of (sMWNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ than that of (pMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+via1(CdS)*, which in turn supports the conclusions of a more efficient charge-separation and a higher maximum MV˙+ concentration for sMWCNT/CSI/CdS.
The nanosecond transient absorption spectra of sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and pMWCNT/CSI/CdS hybrids measured upon 355 nm laser light excitation are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. Broad absorption bands centered at 540 nm appeared for both sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and pMWCNT/CSI/CdS hybrids, immediately after the laser pulse exposure. After reaching a maximum at 10 ns, the intensity of the 540 nm band was found to decay almost completely within 100 ns.

 Fig. 7  Nanosecond transient absorption spectra of pMWCNT/CSI/CdS observed by 355 nm (ca. 2 mJ/ pulse) laser irradiation, obtained in water. Inset: absorption-time profiles at 540 nm. 
According to previously published reports,21,51 the 540 nm centered absorption bands are attributed to (CdS)˙+. Additionally, the absorption bands observed in the NIR region are attributed to reduced CNT.33,56–62 Therefore, the transient absorption spectra provided evidence to support the generation of charge-separated radical ions such as (pMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ and (sMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+. Eventually the decay time profiles for these transient species gave charge recombination rates (kCR) of 1.0 × 107 s−1 and 3.0 × 107 s−1 for the (pMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ and (sMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ hybrids, respectively (see Table 2). From these values, the lifetimes of the radical ion pairs (τRIP) are evaluated as 100 ns and 33 ns, respectively. The shorter τRIP values may reflect closer contact of (CdS)˙+ nanoparticles to (sMWCNT)˙− compared with that to (pMWCNT)˙− as a main reason, since the free-energy changes for charge-recombination for (sMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ and (pMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ are almost the same (0.52–0.58 eV).

From these nanosecond transient absorption measurements, it is confirmed that the fluorescence quenching of the CdS nanoparticles is attributed to the charge separation generating (pMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ and (sMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+via1(CdS)*; thus, the kSq and ΦSq values in Table 1 can be put equal to the charge-separation rate constant (kSCS) and charge-separation quantum yield (ΦSCS), respectively. The larger kSCS value for sMWCNT/CSI/1(CdS)* (1.3 × 1010 s−1) than that for pMWCNT/CSI/1(CdS)* (0.7 × 1010 s−1) is in the same order as the kCR values, suggesting closer contact of (CdS)˙+ nanoparticles to (sMWCNT)˙− compared with that to (pMWCNT)˙−. From the finding that kSCS values are larger than the kCR ones, it is quite feasible to extract the separated charges, electron and hole, for the construction of devices suitable in photovoltaics applications. On the other hand, as a reason for the larger kSCS values than the kCR ones, it is difficult to assume the Marcus reorganization energy as it may be rather similar to the ΔGCS value.27–29 However, delocalization of the electron injected in longer MWCNT may be more important for slow charge recombination.
The drop-cast method was applied to fabricate films of sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and pMWCNT/CSI/CdS. The sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and pMWCNT/CSI/CdS were deposited onto an ITO electrode from the suspension and then dried under N2 atmosphere (abbreviated as ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and ITO/pMWCNT/CSI/CdS, respectively). Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed in a three-compartment cell equipped with a potentiostat, in 0.1 M aqueous Na2S as the redox electrolyte employing a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE),35,63,64 and ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS or ITO/pMWCNT/CSI/CdS as the working electrode and Pt wire as the counter electrode.63–66

Fig. 8 shows the I-V characteristics of the ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS electrode under white light illumination (AM 1.5 condition), where the charge separation in the ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS electrode can be further modulated by the application of an electrochemical bias potential (i.e. three-compartment cell). Apparently, the photocurrent increases compared with the dark current; furthermore, the photocurrent increases as the applied potential is scanned toward more positive potentials. Increased charge separation and the facile transport of charge carriers under a positive bias potential are responsible for the enhanced photocurrent generation. At potentials greater than +0.4 V vs.SCE, the direct electrochemical oxidation of Na2S interferes with the photocurrent measurement. Importantly, the photocurrent generation density of ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS can be controlled by using a three-compartment cell. Thus, it is deduced from Fig. 8 that the net photocurrent generation density of ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS at +0.2 V vs.SCE (∼90 µA cm−2) was higher than the case at 0 V vs.SCE (∼55 µA cm−2).67 Therefore, by controlling the potential of ITO with an electrochemical bias, the charge separation can be controlled and higher Isc can be attained. This suggests that electron injection from the reduced nanotubes, which are generated by a charge-separation process via1(CdS)*, to the ITO electrode occurs.

I-V characteristics of the ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS electrode under white light illumination (AM 1.5 condition). Electrolyte: 0.1 M aqueous Na2S; input light power: 100 mW cm−2. 
In Fig. 9, photocurrent responses of the ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS (responses A and B) and ITO/pMWCNT/CSI/CdS (response C) under white light illumination (AM 1.5 condition; input power = 100 mW cm−2) obtained by applying bias potentials are shown. The photocurrent responses were prompt, steady, and reproducible during repeated on/off cycles of the visible light illumination. The short circuit photocurrent densities (Isc) of ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS at applied bias potentials of 0 and 0.2 V vs.SCE (responses A and B) are about 55 and 90 µA cm−2, respectively. With increasing positive bias to ITO electrode, the Isc value also increases from 55 to 90 µA cm−2. This trend is in good agreement with the I–V characteristics (Fig. 8). Moreover, when the Isc values are compared between ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS (response B) and ITO/pMWCNT/CSI/CdS (response C) at an applied potential of 0.2 V vs.SCE, the Isc value of ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS (90 µA cm−2) is almost six times greater than that of ITO/pMWCNT/CSI/CdS (15 µA cm−2) under the same conditions. This indicates that sMWCNT/CSI/CdS composite is superior to the pMWCNT/CSI/CdS composite. Thus, by controlling the potential of ITO with an electrochemical bias, the charge separation can be controlled and higher Isc as well as IPCE values can be attained (see below).

Measurements on the CSI/CdS system could not be made since deposition onto the ITO was not possible due to the high aqueous solubility of the material. Electrolyte: 0.1 M aqueous Na2S; input power: 100 mW cm−2. 
The photocurrent action spectra of ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and ITO/pMWCNT/CSI/CdS electrodes were measured, by examining the wavelength dependence of the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE). The IPCE values are calculated by normalizing the photocurrent densities for incident light energy and intensity and by use of the following expression:68,69IPCE (%) = 100 × 1240 × i/(Win × λex)where i is the photocurrent density (A cm−2), Win is the incident light intensity (W cm−2), and λex is the excitation wavelength (nm). The photocurrent action spectra of ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and ITO/pMWCNT/CSI/CdS electrodes under an applied bias potential of 0.2 V vs.SCE were recorded using a standard three-compartment cell. As shown in Fig. 10, the IPCE of the ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS electrode reaches 7% at 350 nm, which is 5 times larger than that of the ITO/pMWCNT/CSI/CdS electrode (1.4% at 350 nm).

The maximum IPCE value obtained for ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS (7%) is slightly low as compared to our previous systems composed of carbon nanotube composites,33 while slightly better when compared with porphyrin covalently grafted to carbon nanohorns70 and of a similar value when compared with porphyrin covalently linked to carbon nanotubes.71–74 The obtained results clearly demonstrate that the photoinduced electron transfer process, especially in the sMWCNT/CSI/CdS hybrid material, dictates the light energy conversion, and that such hybrid materials show potential for application in photovoltaic devices.
Conclusion
Summarizing, hybrid materials consisting of CdS nanoparticles, CNT and polymer chains were photophysically studied while the electronic interplay between the semiconducting nanoparticles and the CNT was evaluated. Two types of CNT were used in this study, namely pristine with full length (pMWCNT) and short with length <500 nm (sMWCNT). The obtained results were indicative of the interaction between the CdS nanoparticles and MWCNT in the hybrids in the ground states, as suggested by the absorption spectra and electrochemical data, as well as in the excited states, as was initially attested for both by the efficient quenching of the CdS fluorescence intensity. The dynamics of the interaction were studied by complementary means, including time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy, that is, revealing the charge separation generating (pMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ and (sMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+via the excited state of CdS nanoparticles. The one-electron reduced and oxidized species such as (pMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ and (sMWCNT)˙−/CSI/(CdS)˙+ were also indirectly identified by the accumulation of electron on methyl viologen dication (MV2+) giving the mono-cation radical (MV˙+). The rates of the charge separation and the charge recombination were found to be faster for the hybrid based on the sMWCNT than the corresponding rates for pMWCNT, indicating that nanotube length plays a significant role in donor–acceptor electronic interactions. Additionally, photoelectrochemical cells of the sMWCNT/CSI/CdS and pMWCNT/CSI/CdS hybrid materials were fabricated onto ITO electrodes for the first time. The film of the ITO/sMWCNT/CSI/CdS electrode exhibited an incident photon to photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) of 7% as the maximal value at 350 nm, which is ca. 5 times higher than that of the ITO/pMWCNT/CSI/CdS electrode. Collectively, fluorescence lifetime measurements revealed that photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state of CdS to the nanotubes takes place, while direct electron injection from the reduced nanotubes to the conduction band of the ITO electrode occurs. These processes are responsible for the photocurrent generation. Based on the photoelectrochemical experiments, we conclude that organization of molecular assemblies achieved with sMWCNT/CSI/CdS hybrid materials is a key factor in attaining improved light energy conversion properties.

In this photoelectrochemical cell, MWCNT/CSI/CdS nanohybrids are directly deposited onto ITO electrode without conventional semiconductor nanoparticles such as SnO2 and TiO2 because of solubility problems in the fabrication process.
