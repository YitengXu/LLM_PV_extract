    , Accepted 16th April 2021First published on 16th April 2021AbstractCurrently, the development of high-performance and stable non-noble metal catalysts for low-temperature CO2 methanation is quite challenging for practical industrial applications in terms of highly efficient and renewable energy storage and conversion. In this work, highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles over a perovskite-type AlCeO3 solid-solution support as catalysts for exceptional low-temperature CO2 methanation were synthesized via an innovative single-source Ni–Al–Ce layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursor route. It was demonstrated that the as-fabricated Ni-based catalyst with a Ce/(Ce + Al) molar ratio of 0.2 displayed superior low-temperature catalytic activity for CO2 methanation compared to the Ce-free Ni catalyst and Ni/CeO2 and Ni/Al2O3 catalysts obtained via the impregnation method for comparison, with a high CO2 conversion of 83.2% at only 200 °C and a high CO2 turnover frequency value of 18.2 h−1 achieved at a low reaction temperature of 175 °C. This remarkable low-temperature activity of the catalyst for CO2 methanation outperforms all other supported Ni catalysts reported thus far. It was verified that the favorable Ce3+ sites in the perovskite-type AlCeO3 solid solution contribute to the enhanced medium-strength surface basicity, which is beneficial for CO2 adsorption and the formation of formate intermediate species, thus greatly accelerating the transformation of formate intermediates to the target methane product. Furthermore, for the Ni/AlCe-0.2 catalyst, no deactivation could be observed, indicating the good stability and reusability of the Ce-containing Ni-based catalysts. The present findings provide a new stable and high-performance non-noble metal-based catalyst by integrating Ni nanoparticles with perovskite-type AlCeO3 solid-solution support for exceptional low-temperature CO2 methanation.
1. Introduction
Over the last decade, the issues of climate change stemming from the emission of greenhouse gases and the search for renewable energy sources have caused a renaissance of research on the development of energy storage and valorized utilization of carbon dioxide.1,2 In this regard, CO2 hydrogenation to produce methane, as a basic petrochemical raw material, is regarded as one of the most viable and sustainable processes to store and convert CO2, where molecular hydrogen may be obtained from efficient water electrolysis powered by renewable energy, such as solar energy, wind energy, and hydropower.3 Presently, due to their high activity and good stability under mild reaction conditions, supported noble metal (e.g. Ru,4,5 Rh,6,7 and Pd (ref. 8 and 9)) catalysts have been utilized for the abovementioned Sabatier reaction. Especially, it was reported that CO2 can be completely converted below 200 °C using an Ru/TiO2 catalyst obtained via a polygonal barrel-sputtering route.10 However, both the high cost and the global scarcity of these noble metals hinder their large-scale industrial use.
To date, various heterogeneous and low toxic Ni-based catalysts supported over various metal oxides (Al2O3,11–13 TiO2,14 CeO2,15–21 ZrO2,22 and Al2O3–ZrO2 (ref. 23)) have been explored widely in the methanation of CO2. These oxide supports can significantly affect the capacity for CO2 chemisorption, besides the dispersion and reducibility of active metal species.24–26 In addition, a variety of synthetic approaches for Ni-based catalysts including impregnation, sol–gel technique, ammonia evaporation, and deposition–precipitation have been applied for the methanation reaction.27–30 Compared with ceria-supported catalysts, Ni/Al2O3 catalysts more easily suffer from severe carbon deposition at high reaction temperatures, thus leading to poor stability and lower catalytic activity. Interestingly, reducible ceria with surface oxygen vacancies can exhibit a superior effect as a support for CO2 activation.31,32 Conversely, in most cases, to achieve high methane yields, exothermic CO2 methanations were performed over supported Ni catalysts at high reaction temperatures (above 300 °C), thus easily leading to catalyst deactivation due to the sintering of the Ni particles and the formation of carbon deposition. However, due to the kinetic limitation, the efficiency of CO2 conversion is usually reduced at low reaction temperatures. Therefore, developing high-performance supported Ni catalysts for low-temperature CO2 methanation is a huge challenge. Thus far, only a few supported Ni catalysts have been reported to exhibit superior low-temperature activity for CO2 methanation.31
Encouraged by the good activity and resistance to sintering of previous supported Ni-based catalysts, in this work, we constructed supported Ni-based nanocatalysts by integrating Ni nanoparticles (NPs) with a perovskite-type AlCeO3 solid solution via an innovative single-source Ni–Al–Ce layered double hydroxide (NiAlCe-LDH) precursor approach. Given that the use of LDHs has long been proposed as a promising strategy to construct well-dispersed supported metal catalysts,33–35 the perovskite-type AlCeO3 solid solution could be obtained through the in situ structural transformation of brucite-like layers containing Al and Ce ions, and consequently, the formed Ni NPs could homogeneously disperse on AlCeO3. The results showed that the catalytic activity of the as-fabricated Ni-based catalysts was superior to that of the Ce-free Ni catalyst for the low-temperature methanation of CO2 and CeO2- and Al2O3-supported Ni catalysts obtained through the impregnation method. Especially, the Ni-based catalyst with a Ce/(Ce + Al) molar ratio of 0.2 could achieve a high CO2 conversion of 83.2% at only 200 °C, indicating its excellent low-temperature catalytic activity for CO2 methanation. It was found that the promotional effect of the Ce3+ cations in the AlCeO3 solid-solution support on the adsorption and activation of CO2 was different from that in the Ce3+-rich reducible CeO2, which is related to the presence of oxygen vacancy defects.31,32,36 Here, the Ce3+ cations located in the AlCeO3 solid solution could significantly promote the adsorption and activation of CO2 and greatly facilitate the formation of the formate intermediate, thereby accelerating the CO2 conversion even at low reaction temperatures (<200 °C). To date, there are no reports on the superior low-temperature catalytic activity of non-noble metal catalysts for CO2 methanation. The present work highlights the possibility of integrating Ni NPs with an AlCeO3 solid-solution support to construct supported nickel catalysts for exceptional low-temperature CO2 methanation.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of supported Ni catalysts
Different NiAlCe-LDH precursors were obtained through the solvothermal approach. Typically, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Ce(NO3)2·6H2O, and urea with a molar ratio of 2:(1–x):x:15 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of deionized H2O (8 mL) and ethylene glycol (EG, 72 mL), and then the obtained solution was stirred for about 60 min. Subsequently, the resulting solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave reactor (100 mL), followed by aging at 160 °C for 3 h. The precipitate was filtered by centrifugation, washed 5 times with deionized water, and dried at 80 °C for 10 h to obtain the NiAlCe-LDH-x precursors. Next, the LDH precursors were calcined at 250 °C for 2 h in air to obtain C-LDH-x. Finally, the C-LDH-x samples were heated in an H2/N2 (10/90, v/v) gas mixture at 500 °C for 4 h at a ramp of 5 °C min−1 to obtain the Ni/AlCeO-x catalysts. For comparison, commercial CeO2 and Al2O3 (99%, Alfa Aesar) supported Ni catalysts (Ni/CeO2 and Ni/Al2O3) with an Ni loading amount of about 50% were synthesized via the incipient wetness impregnation method, respectively.
2.2 Sample characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were measured on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The contents of metals in the samples were determined using an ICPS-7500 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). N2 adsorption–desorption experiments were implemented on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2010 electron microscope. High-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (HAADF-STEM-EDX) images were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2010F instrument. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an AXIS SUPRA X-ray photoelectron spectroscope using an Al-K X-ray source. Before measurement, the reduced sample was sealed in an analysis chamber in a glove box via an inert gas conveyor. H2-Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and temperature-programmed desorption of H2 or CO2 (H2-TPD or CO2-TPD) experiments were implemented on a Micromeritics ChemiSorb 2920 instrument using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). During all the measurements, a cold trap (below −88.5 °C by mixing isopropanol with liquid nitrogen) was set to remove the formed water. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was performed on a HITACHI STA7300 thermogravimetric analyzer. The sample was placed in a crucible and heated from room temperature to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 under a 5% O2/He atmosphere. In the case of H2-TPR, the sample (about 100 mg) was outgassed under an argon flow at 200 °C for 1 h and heated from 50 °C to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a stream of H2/N2 (10/90, v/v). In the case of CO2-TPD, the sample was first in situ reduced at 500 °C for 4 h and then switched to an Ar flow at 500 °C for 1 h. Afterward, the sample was saturated with CO2 flow for 1 h at 50 °C, purged by an He flow for 1 h, and heated to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under an He flow. The procedure for the H2-TPD experiments was similar to that for CO2-TPD, except that the stream in the adsorption stage was changed to an H2/N2 flow (10/90, v/v) and the subsequent purging and desorption stage was changed to an Ar flow. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra were obtained on a Bruker Tensor II spectrometer using an MCT detector and in situ reaction cell. Prior to the experiments, the sample was heated to 500 °C under an H2/Ar (1/9, v/v) flow and held for 4 h. Then, the mixture reaction gas with a volume ratio of CO2:H2:Ar = 16:64:20 was introduced into the reaction cell at 50 °C.
2.3 Catalytic CO2 methanation tests
The hydrogenation of CO2 was implemented under atmospheric pressure using a fixed-bed reactor with an interior diameter of 8 mm. Firstly, the catalyst (0.125 g) was pre-reduced in a mixture gas of H2/N2 (10/90, v/v; 100 mL min−1) at 500 °C and held for 4 h. After cooling to 100 °C under nitrogen, a mixture reaction gas of CO2, H2, and Ar (as the internal standard) with a volume ratio of CO2:H2:Ar = 16:64:20 and a total flow of 100 mL min−1 was introduced into the reactor at a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 48000 mL g−1 h−1. The reaction temperature was controlled accurately from 150 °C to 275 °C through a thermocouple located at the middle region of reaction bed. After passing through a cold trap to remove the water formed in the reaction mixture gas, the gaseous products were analyzed online using a GC-9890B gas chromatograph using TCD and FID detectors (TDX-01 and DB-WAX columns). In all cases, the carbon balance was greater than 98%. The CO2 conversion (XCO2, %), CH4 selectivity (SCH4, %), and turnover frequency for CO2 conversion (TOF, h−1) values were calculated according to the following eqn (1)–(3), respectively: (1) (2) (3)where [CO2]in and [CO2]out are the molar flow rate of CO2 in the inlet and outlet, respectively, [CH4] is the molar flow rate of CH4 in the outlet, FCO2, in (L h−1) is the volume flow rate of CO2 at the inlet of the reactor, Vm is the molar volume of CO2 (22.4 L mol−1), and NNi is the molar number of exposed surface metallic Ni0 sites on the Ni-based catalysts.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterization
The NiAlCe-LDH precursors were synthesized via a solvothermal method using a mixture solvent of EG and water. In the case of a lower Ce/(Al + Ce) molar ratio (<0.4), the XRD patterns of the precursors show several characteristic diffractions of the LDH phase with a typical (003) plane at the 2θ value of about 9.7° (Fig. 1A), indicating an enlarged basal spacing compared with that of the carbonate-intercalated LDH with the (003) plane at the 2θ value of about 11.2°.37 This suggests that EG may enter the interlayer spacing of the LDH during its synthesis via the solvothermal process. Meanwhile, with an increase in the cerium content, the diffractions belonging to the LDH phase were reduced gradually. When the Ce/(Al + Ce) molar ratio reached 0.4, a diffraction related to the (111) plane for face-centered cubic fluorite CeO2 phase (JCPDS 34-0394) was detected at about 28.3°. Simultaneously, the enhanced (003) diffraction for the LDH phase is due to the phase separation of the LDH and CeO2. As shown Fig. 1B, the XRD patterns of the reduced Ni/AlCeO-x samples present the characteristic diffractions of cubic metallic nickel phase (JCPDS 04-0850), which are slightly broadened with an increase in the cerium content owing to the reduced size of the nickel particles. Also, no diffractions from the crystalline Al2O3 and/or CeO2 are detected in the cases of a lower Ce/(Al + Ce) of <0.4. For the Ni/AlCeO-0.4 sample, a well-crystallized CeO2 phase can be observed. Meanwhile, it should be noted that a weak and broad diffraction assigned to Ni-containing spinel phases (e.g., NiAl2O4 or Ce-doped NiAl2O4) appears at 2θ of about 64.6°. Furthermore, with an increase in the cerium content, the diffraction for the spinel phase was reduced and finally disappeared in the case of Ni/AlCeO-0.4. This implies that the gradual introduction of Ce ions in the spinel structure through the replacement of Al3+ ions may result in enhanced lattice expansion and distortion due to the much smaller radius of the Al3+ ion (0.054 nm) than that of the Ce3+ (0.102 nm) and Ce4+ ions (0.087 nm). In addition, the specific surface areas of the reduced Ni-based samples range from 178 to 130 m2 g−1, which gradually decreased with an increase in the Ce content (Table 1).

Fig. 2 presents the TEM images of the reduced Ni samples. It can be noted that small Ni NPs showing an average diameter of 5.4–7.5 nm with a narrow particle size distribution are well dispersed over the support surface and present the lattice fringes of 0.204 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of metallic nickel. According to the TEM results for more than 100 particles, the average crystallite size of the Ni particles was estimated to be in the range of 5.4 to 7.5 nm (Table 1), demonstrating that the homogeneous distribution of Ni2+ ions within the brucite-like layers of the LDH precursors may favor the high dispersion of small-sized Ni NPs. Moreover, the HRTEM image of the Ni/AlCeO-0.4 sample also depicts the lattice fringes of the (111) plane for the CeO2 phase with the lattice spacing of 0.312 nm, confirming the formation of the CeO2 phase. Meanwhile, the particle size distributions of the Ni particles reveal that the average particle size shows a decreasing trend with an increase in the Ce content. This demonstrates that the introduction of Ce favors the dispersion of Ni species, and thus the formation of strong interactions between the Ni species and Al–Ce oxide matrix support. Further, the uniform special distributions of Ni, Al, Ce, and O elements over the surface of the representative Ni/AlCeO-0.2 can be observed in the HAADF-STEM images with the corresponding EDX elemental mappings (Fig. 3), suggesting the homogeneous mixture of different components, and thus intimate contact between the Ni particles and the support.

The H2-TPR profiles were measured to identify the reducibility of the calcined LDH samples (Fig. 4). In each case, there are four fitted reduction peaks in the H2-TPR profile. The first small reduction between 200 °C and 350 °C belongs to the reduction of highly dispersed NiO weakly interacting with the support13 or Ce4+ species in the samples.38 Noticeably, the reduction gradually shifts to a lower temperature with the introduction of cerium. Meanwhile, compared with that for the cerium-free sample, the peak area of the Ce-containing samples significantly increased. This result indicates that the introduction of cerium promotes the formation of interfacial contact between Ni and the support. Further, the broad reduction in the range of 350–850 °C can be deconvoluted into three Gaussian subpeaks. Among them, the small shoulder peak in the range of 350–450 °C is attributed to the reduction of a small amount of Ni3+ species bound to oxygen atoms through the Ni–O–Al (or Ce) structure at the interface or NiO-like components.39 The large main peak (500–650 °C) is attributed to the reduction of NiO strongly interacting with the Al–Ce oxide matrix and increased in intensity with the gradual introduction of Ce.21 The peak above 650 °C mainly corresponds to the reduction of the spinel-type NiAl2O4-like phase and decreased in the intensity with an increase in the Ce content due to the difficulty in the formation of spinel phase in the cases of a higher Ce content. For the Ce-containing samples, the reduction of a small amount of Ce4+ to Ce3+ species also occurred above 500 °C,40 thus enveloping the reduction of Ni2+ species in the bulk NiO and spinel phases to some extent. Moreover, the three reduction peaks related to Ni2+ species also all shifted to a lower temperature with an increase in the Ce content. The downward movement of these peaks is caused by the enhanced dispersion of Ni species, further confirming that the introduction of cerium improves the dispersion of nickel species, and thus enhances the reducibility of the nickel species.

3.2 Surface electronic structures of reduced Ni-based samples
XPS characterization was performed to identify the surface compositions and chemical states of the Ni, Ce, and O elements on the surface of the Ni/AlCeO-x samples. Before the measurement, all the reduced samples were sealed in the analysis chamber in a glove box via an inert gas conveyor to prevent surface oxidation of the Ni0 NPs. In the present Ni-based samples, the Ce 3d5/2 core level is partially overlapped with the Ni 2p1/2 core level. Therefore, only the Ce 3d3/2 and Ni 2p3/2 core levels were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5A, the strong signal at about 852.8 eV in the Ni 2p3/2 spectra indicates the presence of Ni0 species,41,42 while the other two peaks at around 855.5 and 856.6 eV are assigned to Ni2+ species strongly bound to the Al–Ce oxide matrix at the interface through the Ni–O–Al (or Ce)-like structure and Ni2+ species in the structure of Ni-containing spinel,43,44 respectively, together with a satellite peak for Ni2+ species at about 862.0 eV. Interestingly, it is noted that with the introduction of Ce, the surface intensity ratio of Ni2+ species at the interface to Ni2+ species in the spinel gradually increased from 0.6 for Ni/AlCeO-0 to 0.72 for Ni/AlCeO-0.1, 0.88 for Ni/AlCeO-0.2, and 1.16 for Ni/AlCeO-0.4, despite the slight change in the surface percentage of Ni0 species in the total Ni species, indicating enhanced interfacial interactions between the Ni species and Al–Ce oxide matrix with an increase in the Ce content.

In the fine Ce 3d3/2 spectrum of Ni/AlCeO-0.1 (Fig. 5B), there are only two signals of μ′ and μ0 components related to Ce3+ species with two final electron configurations of 3d94f2O2p5 and 3d94f1O2p6 states.45 In the case of Ni/AlCeO-0.2, besides two dominant signals of Ce3+ species (μ′ and μ0), four signals of μ, μ′′, μ′′′, and ν′′′ components with Ce3d94f2O2p4, Ce3d94f1O2p5, and Ce3d94f0O2p6 configurations appear in the Ce 3d3/2 and partial Ce 3d5/2 regions, indicating the presence of a small amount of Ce4+ species.45 For the Ni/AlCeO-0.4 sample, it is noted that a larger amount of Ce4+ species was detected, as supported by the XRD results. Based on the integrated peaks of the μ0, μ, μ′, μ′′, and μ′′′ components in the Ce 3d3/2 spectra, the surface Ce3+/(Ce3+ + Ce4+) ratio gradually decreased from 1.0 to 0.91 and 0.49 with the Ce content. However, the surface concentration of Ce3+ species presents a volcano-type change with the addition of Ce (Table 1). Specifically, Ni/AlCeO-0.2 provides the highest surface concentration of Ce3+ species.
As shown in Fig. 5C, with the introduction of cerium, the signals of the Al3+ species in the Al 2p3/2 and Al 2p1/2 core levels gradually shifted to lower binding energies (BEs) from 74.5 to 73.5 eV and from 67.9 to 68.9 eV, respectively. The large negative shift of about 1.0 eV in the BE value of Al3+ species reflects the formation of a surface Ce3+–O–Al3+-like structure. In addition, in the fine O 1s spectrum of Ni/AlCeO-0 (Fig. 5D), a large peak and a small peak appear at 531.3 eV and 533.0 eV, respectively, which are assigned to the lattice oxygen species (OII) and surface-adsorbed oxygen species (O2− and O−) on the defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies) and hydroxyl groups (OI).46,47 In the case of Ni/AlCeO-0.4, the other peak (OIII) at about 529.4 eV is associated with the lattice oxygen species in the CeO2 structure. It was noted that with the introduction of Ce, the BE values of the OI and OII peaks gradually decreased to about 530.7 and 532.4 eV for Ni/AlCeO-0.4, mirroring the gradually enhanced interactions between oxygen and surrounding single-electron defective Ce3+ atoms.
The abovementioned results illustrate the presence of a Ce–O–Al-like structure in the Ce-containing Ni-based samples. This is probably due to the formation of a perovskite-type CeAlO3 solid solution through the facile structural transformation of the NiAlCe-LDH precursors with homogeneously distributed Al and Ce ions within the brucite-like layers during calcination and following reduction for the preparation of Ni-based samples. Meanwhile, it was demonstrated that only a small amount of oxygen vacancies is present in our samples. Previously, it was reported in the literature that CeAlO3 perovskite can be formed by the reduction of highly dispersed cerium oxide on alumina at 600 °C in an H2 atmosphere. Therefore, in the present Ce-containing Ni-based samples, a large amount of Ce3+ ions are mainly bound to oxygen atoms through the Ce–O–Al structure, thereby potentially forming a perovskite-type solid solution, thus modifying the surface interactions between the support and Ni NPs.
Raman spectroscopy is an effective tool for analyzing the structure of materials. As shown in Fig. 6, pure CeO2 has a fluorite structure with a Raman-active phonon (T2g) at 464 cm−1.48 In addition to the Ce-free Ni/AlCeO-0 sample, Ni/AlCeO-0.1 does not present the characteristic vibrational spectra of the CeO2 phase. Instead, a broad peak centered at 554 cm−1 is observed, which is correlated with the longitudinal optical (LO) mode of the NiO-like phase due to the doping of Al3+ and Ce3+ ions.49 With a gradual increase in the Ce content, the peak at 554 cm−1 shifted toward the higher frequency of about 600 cm−1, which is due to the formation of more Ni–O–Ce3+ bonds and a new band corresponding to Al–O–Ce3+ appeared. In this case, the incorporation of Ce3+ into the lattice of the NiO-like and alumina-like oxides causes an increase in the M-O vibration frequency, thus resulting in a positive shift in the Raman peak. For Ni/AlCeO-0.4, in addition to the broad band at 600 cm−1, a quite weak peak at 464 cm−1 was observed, indicating the formation of a small amount of CeO2 phase, as evidenced by the XRD results. The results confirm the formation of strong interactions between nickel and Al–Ce oxides and the Al–O–Ce3+ bond in the Ce-containing samples.

Combined with the abovementioned XRD, XPS, and Raman results, it is inferred that for the Ce-containing Ni-based samples, the Ni species can strongly bound to the Al–Ce oxide matrix, while an AlCeO3 solid solution with an Al–O–Ce3+ bond can form. In summary, the introduction of cerium in the support can lead to the local reconstruction of amorphous alumina to weaken the interactions between the Ni species and the matrix in the calcined samples, thereby promoting the dispersion of nickel species. Therefore, it is expected that the formation of strong interactions between the small Ni NPs and the support can optimize the structural and electronic properties of the active metal sites, probably leading to an improved catalytic performance.
3.3 Surface adsorption of CO2 and H2 on samples
CO2-TPD experiments were conducted to determine the surface basicity of the samples. As presented in Fig. 7, in each case, the CO2 desorption profile can be divided into three regions, i.e., 50–150 °C, 150–500 °C, and above 500 °C, which correspond to the desorption of CO2 on the weak, medium-strength, and strong basic surface sites,50 respectively. The weak basic (WB) surface sites mainly originate from the amorphous Al2O3, CeO2, and surface hydroxyl groups, whereas the medium-strength basic (MSB) sites are mainly associated with the Al–Ce oxides and Ni–O pairs. The strong basic (SB) sites can be caused by the surface coordinatively unsaturated O2− species. It is considered that the weak and medium-strength basic surface sites mainly participate in the generation of reaction intermediates through the adsorption and activation of CO2 during CO2 hydrogenation. Interestingly, it is noted from Table S1† that with the introduction of Ce, the density of medium-strength basic sites and weak basic sites, gradually increased from Ni/AlCeO-0 to Ni/AlCeO-0.2, together with a slight positive shift in the desorption peak. This is related to the medium strength basic sites, indicating the increased CO2 adsorption capacity and enhanced basic strength. However, a further increase in the Ce content in the case of Ni/AlCeO-0.4 did not cause an obvious increase in the amount of medium-strength basic sites, although it possessed the largest density of surface basic sites. Among the samples, Ni/AlCeO-0.2 afforded the largest density of weak and medium-strength basic sites. Therefore, the introduction of cerium may promote the adsorption of CO2 on the Ni-based samples due to the formation of more AlCeO3 solid solution.

Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 8, the in situ DRIFT spectra of CO2 adsorption were obtained to study the surface basicity of two representative Ni-based samples. For Ni/AlCeO-0, CO2 is mainly adsorbed in the form of bidentate carbonates (1575, 1548 and 1341 cm−1), unidentate carbonates (1491 and 1391 cm−1), and bicarbonates (1424 cm−1) at 100 °C.22 Noticeably, the intensity of the two absorption bands for bidentate and unidentate carbonates was greatly reduced with an increase in the adsorption temperature, indicating the reduced thermal stability of the carbonates formed on Ni/AlCeO-0. In the case of Ni/AlCeO-0.2, in addition to small amounts of unidentate (1525 and 1377 cm−1) carbonates and bicarbonate (1424 cm−1), the bidentate carbonates (1564 and 1332 cm−1) were dominant and maintained a relatively high intensity even at 250 °C, reflecting the formation of a strong interaction between CO2 and the basic sites associated with the surface Ce(III)–O pairs. The results further demonstrate that the appropriate introduction of Ce in the Ni-based precursor can promote the adsorption and activation of CO2, which is conductive to the hydrogenation of CO2.

It is well known that surface Ni0 sites can activate and homolytically dissociate hydrogen molecules to generate active hydrogen species. To determine the dispersion of metallic Ni species and surface structures of the catalysts, H2-TPD experiments were performed (Fig. 9). In the absence of H2 in the TPD experiments, no TCD signal in the range of 50–900 °C was detected. Therefore, it can be considered that the TCD signals of the Ni-based samples are associated with hydrogen desorption. In each case, there is a small desorption peak at about 100 °C, which is assigned to the surface weak adsorption of hydrogen. There are three desorption components in the range of 100 °C to 500 °C, which are associated with the desorption of chemisorbed hydrogen on the Ni0 sites located at the terrace, the step, and the corner,51–53 respectively. From weight-normalized H2 chemisorption data (Table S2†), it is noted that Ni/AlCeO-0.2 with a lower Ni content presents a larger amount of chemisorbed H2 due to the smaller size of the Ni0 particles and higher dispersion of Ni species. In addition, the desorption above 500 °C is correlated with hydrogen spillover.54,55 Noticeably, with the introduction of Ce, the hydrogen spillover was gradually reduced. In contrast, the Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/CeO2 reference samples prepared by the impregnation method presented much smaller amounts of H2 uptake in comparison with all the Ni/AlCeO-x samples (Table S2†).

3.4 Catalytic performance of Ni-based catalysts

Fig. 10 shows the catalytic activity in CO2 methanation over different Ni/AlCeO-x catalysts at different reaction temperatures (150–280 °C) at a GHSV of 48000 mL g−1 h−1. For all the set reaction temperatures, the conversion and CH4 selectivity were obtained after about 1 h on stream, while the change in temperature across the catalyst bed during CO2 methanation was negligible. It can be seen that all the Ni-based catalysts were active towards CO2 methanation. Compared with that over Ni/AlCeO-0 (175 °C), the onset temperature over the cerium-containing samples decreased to 150 °C, showing the superior catalytic activity of the Ce-containing Ni-based catalysts. Over the Ce-free Ni/AlCeO-0, the CO2 conversion initially increased slowly to 10.5% from 175 °C to 200 °C, then rapidly increased to 71.2% at 225 °C, and finally increased to 85% at 275 °C. With the introduction of Ce in the catalysts, Ni/AlCeO-0.1 delivered a higher CO2 conversion of 75.1% at 200 °C. In the cases of higher Ce contents, the CO2 conversion dramatically reached 82.3 for Ni/AlCeO-0.2 and 77.3% for Ni/AlCeO-0.4 at a lower reaction temperature of 189 °C, respectively, and then increased slowly from 189 °C to 280 °C because the thermodynamic equilibrium limits the CO2 conversion at high temperatures. Thus, it can be concluded that the activities of the Ce-containing Ni-based catalysts are superior to that of the Ce-free catalyst at all temperatures in the range of 150–280 °C, and the catalytic activity of the Ni/AlCeO-0.2 catalyst reached the maximum, with a CO2 conversion of 83.2% at 200 °C. Meanwhile, the CH4 selectivity over all the catalysts is higher than 99.5%. The low reaction temperature strongly confirms that the introduction of cerium remarkably improves the activity of the Ni-based catalysts for CO2 methanation, especially at low temperatures (<200 °C). In addition, compared with all the present Ni/AlCeO catalysts, the two Ni/CeO2 and Ni/Al2O3 reference catalysts afforded much lower conversions of 12.4% and 13.0% at 275 °C (Fig. S1†), reflecting their much poorer catalytic activity for CO2 methanation. In comparison, the present Ni/AlCeO-0.2 catalyst exhibited superior low-temperature catalytic activity to the other Ni-based catalysts previously reported for CO2 methanation (Table S3†),13,23,30,31,56–65 even at a higher GHSV value of 48000 mL g−1 h−1 in our case. This demonstrates that the integration of highly dispersed Ni NPs with a perovskite AlCeO3 solid-solution support is a successful strategy to construct high-performance Ni-based catalysts for exceptional low-temperature CO2 methanation.

The abovementioned comprehensive characterization results demonstrate that the introduction of cerium can improve the dispersion of nickel species. Usually, the structure and composition of metal catalysts can greatly affect their catalytic performance. Thus, to determine the inherent activity of these Ni-based catalysts, the turnover frequency (TOF) value was calculated based on the moles of CO2 converted per mole of exposed active metallic nickel site with time (<10.0%) at 175 °C, thus eliminating the influence of the change in the amount of exposed surface Ni0 sites on the catalytic activity. Fig. 11A presents the change in the TOF value with the Ce/(Al + Ce) molar ratio. It is noted that the introduction of cerium resulted in an increase in the TOF value. Especially, Ni/AlCeO-0.2 afforded a three-times higher TOF value of 18.2 h−1 than that of the Ce-free catalyst (5.7 h−1), mirroring the excellent promotion of the introduction of Ce on the CO2 methanation. The TOF value of 18.2 h−1 for Ni/AlCeO-0.2 obtained only at the low temperature of 175 °C is larger than or comparable to that of other previously reported Ni-based catalysts attained at much higher reaction temperatures (250 °C or above) (Table S3†), indicating the superior low-temperature activity of Ni/AlCeO-0.2. Further, the inherent activity of the different catalysts related to the surface fraction of Ce3+ species was investigated. As shown in Fig. 11B, the TOF value almost increased linearly with an increase in the surface Ce3+ concentration on the catalysts, and especially Ni/AlCeO-0.2 with the highest surface Ce3+ concentration achieved the highest TOF value. This result strongly illustrates that surface Ce3+ species with appropriate basicity should play a key role in activating CO2 and the reaction intermediates during CO2 methanation. Therefore, the superior low-temperature catalytic performance of Ni/AlCeO-0.2 should be closely associated with the formation of a surface perovskite-type AlCeO3 solid solution in the present catalytic system. The abovementioned CO2-TPD results reveal that an appropriate amount of Ce in the catalysts can improve the weak and medium-strength surface basicity of the catalysts, thereby facilitating the adsorption and activation of CO2 to form carbonate and bicarbonate intermediates (DRIFTS of CO2 adsorption), and thus a series of hydrogenation processes to produce CH4 with the help of metallic Ni0 sites. Correspondingly, the Ni/AlCeO3-0.2 catalyst containing the highest amount of weak and medium-strength basic surface sites presented the highest catalytic activity. Also, Fig. 12 shows the long-term stability of the Ni/AlCeO-0.2 catalyst for CO2 methanation at 183 °C under a GHSV of 48000 mL g−1 h−1. Notably, Ni/AlCeO-0.2 could deliver a high conversion of 62% with a high CH4 selectivity of above 99.5%. During the 55 h test, the catalyst showed outstanding stability with no obvious decline in the conversion and selectivity for CH4. Also, the TG analysis of the used catalyst under a 5% O2/He flow revealed that no obvious combustion of carbonaceous species occurred above 200 °C (Fig. S2†). Thus, the abovementioned result demonstrates the potential industrial application of the catalyst.

Fig. 13 depicts the in situ DRIFT spectra of CO2 methanation over representative Ni/AlCeO-0 and Ni/AlCeO-0.2 catalysts. With the introduction of CO2 and H2, Ni/AlCeO-0 mainly showed the characteristic absorption bands of several intermediate species including carbonyl species belonging to linear adsorption (2011 cm−1) and bridge-bonded adsorption (1911 and 1835 cm−1) on the Ni0 sites,66 bidentate formate species (1590 and 1374 cm−1),67,68 and bicarbonate species (1201 and 1626 cm−1).69 At low temperatures, the adsorbed bicarbonate and formate species are dominant. When the temperature increased to 250 °C, the intensity of formate species decreased rapidly, the while bicarbonate species disappeared. Meanwhile, with an increase in temperature, the absorption of carbonyl species was remarkably enhanced and finally dominated, accompanied by a rapid decrease in the intensity of formate species. The abovementioned results reveal that adsorbed CO* species should play a key role in the CO2 methanation over Ni/AlCeO-0. In this case, CO2 methanation proceeds via a CO* intermediate path. Firstly, the CO2 adsorbed on the surface hydroxyl is converted into bicarbonate species, and then the bicarbonate species are hydrogenated into formate species. Subsequently, the formate species are hydrogenated into CO* species adsorbed on the Ni0 sites. Finally, the CO* species can be hydrogenated to generate methane.
 Fig. 13

In comparison, for Ni/AlCeO-0.2, besides that of the bicarbonate (1218 cm−1) and methoxy (1068 cm−1) species with quite low intensity,70,71 the absorption of formate species (1581 and 1368 cm−1) with high thermal stability is strong at 100 °C and remained dominant until 250 °C. Meanwhile, in the range of 100 °C to 250 °C, two absorption bands of bidentate carbonate species also can be detected at about 1554 and 1326 cm−1,72 respectively, mirroring the strong adsorption of CO2. No adsorbed CO* species was detected. This result illustrates that methane is more likely to form on Ni/AlCeO-0.2 compared with Ni/AlCeO-0. Meanwhile, the absorption of methoxy species is slightly enhanced with an increase in the reaction temperature. It is well documented that CO species can be formed by CO2 adsorption and decomposition on Ni0 particles at high temperatures. In the case of Ni/AlCeO-0.2, the reaction route does not obey the CO intermediate path. According to the abovementioned results, with the help of dissociated hydrogen on the Ni0 sites, the formate intermediate can easily form on Ni/AlCeO-0.2 with more adsorption sites for CO2, and then formate is directly hydrogenated to generate –CH2OH and –CH3 groups, finally forming methane.73 This formate intermediate pathway can favor the production of methane, without the formation of carbonyl species, thus greatly promoting CO2 methanation.
According to the abovementioned mechanism for CO2 hydrogenation over the Ni-based catalysts, a plausible mechanism for CO2 hydrogenation to produce methane over the perovskite-type AlCeO3 solid solution supported Ni catalysts is proposed (Scheme 1). Specifically, both the metallic Ni sites and the oxide support can participate in the hydrogenation of CO2. In the case of the Ce-containing catalysts, the formate intermediates are considered to originate from the bidentate carbonate species likely strongly adsorbed on the basic oxygen sites bound to the Ce(III) ions on the surface. These Ce3+ cations located in the structure of AlCeO3 solid solution are in intimate contact with the active metallic Ni0 sites at the nickel-support interface. Therefore, the introduction of an appropriate amount of Ce(III) in the catalysts can enhance their capacity for CO2 adsorption and facilitate the formation of bidentate carbonate species and stabilize the formate intermediates, thereby accelerating the transformation of formate intermediates and greatly improving the low-temperature catalytic performance of the catalysts. Among the catalysts including the Ce-containing and Ce-free Ni-based catalysts, Ni/AlCeO-0.2 showed the most efficient nickel-support synergy.

4. Conclusions
In summary, perovskite-type AlCeO3 solid solution supported nickel catalysts for low-temperature CO2 methanation were fabricated from single-source NiAlCe-LDH precursors. It was found that the introduction of cerium in the NiAl-LDH precursors led to an enhancement in the reducibility of the Ni species, and thus promoted the dispersion of metallic Ni0 sites and formation of novel perovskite-type AlCeO3 solid-solution support. Therefore, the surface density of medium-strength basic sites related to oxygen atoms bound to Ce3+ ions in the structure of AlCeO3 increased with the introduction of Ce. It was demonstrated that the as-fabricated supported Ni-based with an appropriate amount of Ce exhibited excellent low-temperature activity and stability for CO2 methanation, together with a high methane yield of ∼83% at 200 °C. This remarkable low-temperature activity of the catalyst for CO2 methanation outperforms all other supported Ni catalysts reported thus far. This exceptional low-temperature catalytic efficiency for CO2 methanation was correlated with the synergy between the Ni0 sites and surface Ce3+ species in the structure of the AlCeO3 solid solution matrix. Correspondingly, carbon dioxide easily was activated on the Ce3+-rich AlCeO3 support, greatly accelerating the transformation of formate intermediates to the target methane product. Thus, our findings present a new approach for the development of high-performance and stable supported nickel catalysts for exceptional low-temperature CO2 methanation.
