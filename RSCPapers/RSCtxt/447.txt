    , Accepted 29th January 2021First published on 3rd February 2021AbstractSpinel trimetallic sulfide M0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 (M = Cu and Mn) nanostructures are designed and synthesized for the first time via a facile one-pot solvothermal strategy and used as efficient counter electrodes (CEs) for quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). Electrochemical tests show that the interface charge transfer resistance (Rct) of Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 is only 0.79 Ω, which is less than half of the Rct of NiCo2S4 (2.04 Ω). The best power conversion efficiency of QDSSCs assembled with the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode and Ti-mesh substrate Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 CE reaches 5.20%. The superior electrocatalytic activity toward Sn2− reduction is attributed to the synergy effects of multiple transition metal heteroatoms, and the outstanding stability may stem from the distorted structures of spinel trimetallic sulfides. This work exhibits the potential of spinel trimetallic sulfides to be competitive CE material candidates for efficient QDSSCs.
Introduction
Renewable energy has been a global issue in recent years. Solar energy, with its inexhaustible, green and clean characteristics, has become an ideal new energy to solve the current energy and environmental problems.1 Quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) are of low-cost and highly efficient third generation solar cells.2 As an alternative to conventional organic sensitizers, inorganic semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been drawing widespread attention as reliable alternative light absorbers, due to their tunable band gap energy, high extinction coefficient, quantum confinement effect, hot electron extraction and multi exciton effect by impact ionization.3–5 As one of the important components of QDSSCs, counter electrodes (CEs) exert great influence on the performance of the cell such as the fill factor (FF), open circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit current density (Jsc).6,7 Traditional noble platinum CEs exhibit poor catalytic activity and stability because of the poisoning effect caused by S2− chemisorbed onto the Pt surface in polysulfide electrolytes.6,8 Exploring ideal CEs has become a continuous and long ongoing effort in the development of QDSSCs, such as various transition metal sulfides including PbS,9 Cu2S,10 NiS,11 Co3S4,12 Cu2ZnSnS4,13etc.
Spinel bimetallic sulfides have attracted extensive attention owing to their excellent physicochemical properties and have become one kind of popular functional material for the past few years. These materials commonly possess a universal structure, which is capable of accommodating various transition metal cations including Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, etc.4,14 Combining the contributions from metal ions and richer redox reactions, spinel bimetallic sulfides exhibit excellent electrochemical comprehensive performances compared to the corresponding monometallic sulfides, and are widely used in electrochemical fields such as supercapacitors,15,16 Li–O2 batteries,17,18 dye sensitized solar cells,19,20 and water splitting.21,22
So far, there have been limited reports on the use of spinel bimetallic sulfides as CEs for QDSSCs, and NiCo2S4 CEs have become the focus of attention. For example, all nanostructured NiCo2S4 CEs grown on titanium wires12 and titanium sheets,23 NiCo2S4 nanoparticles24 and hierarchical nanostructured NiCo2S425 CEs exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic activity. The above-mentioned NiCo2S4 CEs are all assembled into the QDSSCs with CdS/CdSe photoanodes, and the highest PCE is 3.94%.25 And the QDSSCs based on CdSe/ZnS photoanodes and hollow NiCo2S4 CEs have reached an efficiency of 4.22%.26 However, as an electrode material, there are still two important aspects that need to be further improved. One is the intrinsic conductivity of spinel sulfide which is not so high that most of them are composited with high conductivity materials such as foamed nickel,14,21,27 titanium sheets,23 carbon materials4,19,24,28,29 and other materials to improve the electrochemical activity. The other one is cycle stability. Regardless of their application in capacitors,28,30 electrochemical hydrogen evolution31 or CEs for QDSSCs,4 their cycle stability is not very satisfactory.
As is known, spinel oxides are weaker than the corresponding spinel sulfides in terms of electrical activity and stability.17,32 The latest research on spinal oxides shows that no matter whether they are used in the ORR33,34 or OER33 or supercapacitors,35 the comprehensive cycle stability and electrode activity of spinel-type trimetallic oxides are superior to those of the corresponding bimetallic ones. However, to the best of our knowledge, spinel-type trimetallic sulfides are still unexplored. As the atomic radii of Cu, Mn, Ni and Co are similar to each other, CuCo2S4,24 MnCo2S44 and NiCo2S432 show good reduction towards polysulfide ions as electrode materials; this work is designed to prepare spinel trimetallic sulfides M0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 (M = Cu and Mn) and aims to realize the synergistic integration of different electrochemical properties, such as high catalytic activity, and structural stability through the combined utilization of multiple transition metal heteroatoms. In the process, tertbutanol (TBA) was used as a structure directing agent to improve the morphology of the prepared spinel,29,36 and the schematic illustration of spinel trimetallic sulfide preparation is shown in Fig. 1. As expected, the catalytic activity and stability of spinel trimetallic sulfides are higher than those of the corresponding bimetallic spinel, and the Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 nanoparticles show the best catalytic activity for the reduction of polysulfide ions. The PCE of the QDSSCs with the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode and Ti-mesh substrate Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 CE reached the highest efficiency of 5.20%.

Experimental section
Materials
Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals used in this work were purchased from Aladdin (Sigma-Aldrich) and used without any further purification.
Preparation of spinel trimetallic sulfides
In a typical synthesis, 2.67 mmol Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.67 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.67 mmol nitrate hydrated salt of the third metal (Cu, Mn) and 12 mmol thiourea were dissolved in a 67 mL of mixed solution of DI water and TBA (2:3 in volume) by stirring. 3 mL of ammonia was added dropwise to the solution which was then kept magnetically stirred for another 1 h. The mixture was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, sealed, and heated in an oven at 180 °C for 12 h. After that, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature and the black precipitate was washed with deionized water and ethanol three times and dried at 60 °C for 24 h in a vacuum. Finally, the collected Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 and Mn0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 were annealed at 350 °C for 2 h under an argon atmosphere. For comparison, the corresponding NiCo2S4, CuCo2S4 and MnCo2S4 were manufactured in the same way.
Fabrication of counter electrodes
All of these CEs were prepared by the blade coating method. An appropriate amount of binder solution (obtained by mixing 8.0 mL of terpineol with 0.2 g of ethyl cellulose and 0.5 mL titanium isopropoxide37) was added dropwise to about 100 mg of spinel material in order to prepare a slurry. The slurry was then scraped onto the titanium mesh substrate (an 80-mesh wire). Finally, the CE was heated at 400 °C for 30 min under an argon atmosphere. The thickness of the electrode material covered in the titanium mesh is equal to the thickness of one layer of scotch tape.
Fabrication of photoanodes and assembly of QDSSCs
Photoanodes (TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS) of QDSSCs were prepared according to the literature method with some modification. Initially, commercially available F-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass was immersed in a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min. Then, the TiO2 slurry consisting of P25, ethyl cellulose and terpineol was spin-coated onto the FTO glass and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After that, CdS/CdSe QDs and ZnS passivation layers were deposited by the successive ion layer adsorption reaction (SILAR) process. Three SILAR cycles of ZnS deposition were carried out using a 0.1 M Zn(AC)2·2H2O and 0.1 M Na2S·9H2O. Then, in a typical preparation of CdS QDs, the film was dipped in a 0.1 M Cd(AC)2·2H2O and 0.1 M Na2S·9H2O, respectively. After each immersion, it was rinsed with deionized water and dried at 60 °C. This cycle process was repeated up to five times. And another eight cycles of CdSe QDs adopted 0.2 M aqueous Na2SeSO3 instead of Na2S·9H2O solution. At last, two layers of ZnS were added using the same method.
The fabricated various CEs and TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanodes were sealed to acquire sandwich QDSSCs via insulation tapes. The inner space of the cells was occupied by the redox electrolyte including 2 M S, 2 M Na2S and 0.2 M KCl in a mixed solution of methanol and deionized water (7:3 in volume). The effective area of the cell is 0.25 cm2.
Characterization
The morphology of the samples was studied by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM; Regulus8100). The spatial distribution and amount of sulfur and transition metal ions were determined by elemental mapping and line scanning EDX. The specific surface area was tested by using the N2 adsorption–desorption technique (Micromeritics ASAP 2460). The crystallographic information on powders was characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker AXS GmbH, D8 ADVANCE, Cu Kα radiation). Raman spectra were analyzed using a Raman microscope (Sierra IM-52, Snowy Range Instruments) using a laser wavelength of 785 nm. The chemical state and surface composition were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ((XPS; Thermo, ESCALAB 250Xi)) using monochromatized Al Kα X-rays. The elemental composition of the sample was obtained by using the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) technique. An electrochemical system (Ivium-N-Stat Multichannel potentiostat) was used to perform cyclic voltammetry tests (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), tafel polarization measurements (Tafel) and analyze the photovoltaic performance. In the process of measurement, the current–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) of QDSSCs were recorded under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) using a HGILX500 technologies (China) solar simulator, which was calibrated by a standard crystalline silicon solar cell.
Results and discussion
Structural and morphological characterization
The SEM images of the spinel trimetallic sulfides are shown in Fig. 2a and b and Fig. S1a and b (ESI†). The Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 nanoparticles synthesized exhibit irregular morphology and most of the particles are around 50 nm in size. And the Mn0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 is formed by the disordered stack of nanosheets and microparticles, whose particle size is about 200 nm. Compared with Mn0.5Ni0.5Co2S4, the smaller Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 nanoparticles ensure the larger surface area of the CE, which can provide more reaction sites for the catalytic reduction of Sn2−. The EDX mapping images of Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 (Fig. 2c) show that all the component elements (Cu, Ni, Co and S) are well distributed in the nanostructures. The specific surface areas of samples were investigated using the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The relevant parameters of all samples are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The BET surface areas of Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 and Mn0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 are 14.59 m2 g−1 and 9.30 m2 g−1, respectively, which are lower than those of corresponding bimetallic sulfides.

The phase formation of spinel trimetallic sulfides and the corresponding bimetallic sulfides was examined by XRD, as shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S3 (ESI†). The diffraction peaks at 16.1°, 26.6°, 31.3°, 38.0°, 50.0° and 54.8° are ascribed to CuCo2S4 (PDF 42-1450).24 And the diffraction peaks at 16.3°, 26.8°, 31.6°, 38.3°, 50.5° and 55.3° are assigned to NiCo2S4 (PDF 20-0782).21,23 No additional peaks are discovered in the XRD patterns, indicating the high purity of the as-prepared samples. It is worth noting that the diffraction peaks of the (4 4 0) plane of the M0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 (M = Cu and Mn) phase are slightly shifted towards the higher (lower) angle in 2θ than those of the ACo2S4 (A = Cu or Mn) phase (NiCo2S4 phase). Fundamentally, Cu and Mn atoms have larger atomic radii than Ni atoms. Thus, the partial substitution of Ni atoms in A sites with Cu or Mn atoms results in crystal distortions and XRD shifts are observed in the spinel trimetallic sulfides.35

Raman spectra further confirm the distorted structure of samples since the shifts at about 650 cm−1 of spinel trimetallic sulfides are visible (in Fig. 3b and Fig. S4, ESI†).38 In addition, the two peaks at 450–500 cm−1 widen and join together, reflecting the decrease in crystallinity. Both XRD and Raman results demonstrate convincingly that the spinel trimetallic sulfides were successfully synthesized via the one-pot solvothermal strategy.
The elemental state and composition of samples were further investigated via the XPS as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S5, S6 (ESI†). The survey spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. S5a and b (ESI†), which include the Cu (Mn), Ni, Co and S elements. By using the Gaussian–Lorentz mix fitting method, two spin–orbit doublets can be observed in Fig. 4a. The peaks located at 932.1 and 952.0 eV are typical values for Cu+,36,39,40 while the peaks at 934.3 and 954.5 eV, as well as the weak signal at around 944.0 eV, are assigned to Cu2+.24,36,40–42 Similarly, the Mn 2p XPS spectrum can be fitted into two peaks at 640.1 and 642.2 eV of Mn2+ and Mn3+, respectively, as shown in Fig. S6a (ESI†).4,43,44 From Fig. 4b and c and Fig. S6b and c (ESI†), the Ni 2p and Co 2p spectra are better fitted into two spin–orbit doublets (Ni2+/Ni3+ and Co2+/Co3+) and two shake-up satellites, respectively.30,45–47Fig. 4d and Fig. S6d (ESI†) illustrate the XPS of S 2p, where two main peaks observed at 161.6 and 162.8 eV are ascribed to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2.4,17 These peaks are typical metal-sulfur bonds in spinel sulfides. The satellite peak at 168.9 eV indicates surface sulfur with high oxidation state, such as sulfates.48,49 The relative abundance of Cu, Ni and Co were analyzed by ICP. The ICP analysis reveals that the Cu:Ni:Co ratio amounts to 0.5:0.5:2.0, which is consistent with the feed ratio during synthesis.

Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization measurements were carried out on a symmetric dummy cell fabricated with two identical CEs. Fig. 5a shows the typical EIS Nyquist plots of the CEs and the inset shows the enlarged part of the spinel trimetallic sulfides electrode EIS plots. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the equivalent circuit in which Rs indicates the series resistance containing the sheet resistance of the titanium mesh substrate and the ohmic impedance of the external circuit that can be estimated from the intercept on the real axis at high frequency. Note that the first semicircle at the middle frequency represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the interface of the electrode/electrolyte, which is closely related to the catalytic activity of a CE. In the low frequency region, the oblique line reflects the Nernst diffusion resistance (ZN) within the polysulfide electrolyte. The obtained impedance parameters are fitted using Zsimplewin software, as shown in Table 1. The values of Rs (3.06 Ω) and Rct (2.04 Ω) of NiCo2S4 are smaller than those of other bimetallic sulfides. Both the Rs and Rct further decrease with Cu and Mn atoms partially replacing Ni atoms. The Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 CE has the minimum Rs value (2.64 Ω) and Rct value (0.79 Ω), indicating prominent conductivity and better electrochemical activity.

Fig. 5b shows the Tafel plots of the symmetrical cells. The exchange current density (J0) can be derived from the zero intercept of the extrapolated linear region of the curve, which is used to further evaluate the electrochemical activity of CEs. In the Tafel zone (at the middle potential), a steeper slope indicates a higher J0. It is evident from the figure that trimetallic sulfide CEs show larger slope than all bimetallic sulfide CEs, and the Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 CE shows the highest J0 which suggests that the Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 CE exhibits the best catalytic activity for Sn2− reduction. This is consistent with the EIS experimental results. It is worth noting that spinel trimetallic sulfides possess a smaller BET surface area but exhibit superior electrochemical properties compared to their corresponding bimetallic sulfides, which reflects the excellent intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. And it is speculated that the electrocatalytic activity stems from the synergy effects of multiple transition metal heteroatoms in spinel sulfides, and Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 shows the best electrocatalytic activity for rich catalytic active sites compared to Mn0.5Ni0.5Co2S4.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to further demonstrate the electrochemical activity of CEs, as shown in Fig. 6a. The three-electrode system was adopted in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M S, 0.1 M Na2S and 0.1 M KCl at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, where the Pt and Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Obviously, Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 CE achieves the highest peak current density and the lowest peak-to-peak separation (Epp = 0.48 V), suggesting that it has the best electrocatalytic properties among CEs. What is more, the electrochemical stabilities of electrodes were verified by multi-cycle successive CV measurements. Fifty cycles of continuous CV scanning of spinel trimetallic sulfides and corresponding bimetallic sulfides (Fig. 6b–d and Fig. S8a–c, ESI†) were performed at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The insets show the CV plots only for the first and fiftieth cycles. After fifty cycles of successive scanning, the CuCo2S4 CE exhibits the best stability in bimetallic sulfides. In addition, compared with the corresponding bimetallic sulfides, the stabilities of spinel trimetallic sulfides have been further improved, and Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 CE maintains almost the same CV curve. The outstanding electrochemical stability of the spinel trimetallic sulfide electrodes in the polysulfide electrolyte system may stem from the distorted structures of trimetallic spinel sulfides.50

Photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs

Fig. 7 shows the J–V curves obtained under 100 mW cm−2 sunlight illumination for QDSSCs with spinel trimetallic sulfides and the corresponding bimetallic sulfide CEs along with TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS as the photoanodes. The photovoltaic performances are determined by the Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE which are also summarized in Table 1. Obviously, the QDSSCs assembled with Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 CEs exhibits the highest Jsc of 18.11 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.59 V, a FF of 0.49 and a PCE of 5.20%. Compared with the QDSSCs based on the NiCo2S4 CE, the value of PCE is increased by 31.98%. Photovoltaic parameters are in line with the electrocatalytic ability of CEs discussed in the electrochemical characterization above.

Conclusion
In summary, spinel trimetallic sulfides have been successfully prepared through a facile one-pot solvothermal method. Compared with the corresponding bimetallic sulfides, trimetallic sulfides exhibit lower electrochemical impedance, higher exchange current density and better electrochemical stability for Sn2− reduction. The superior electrocatalytic activity are attributed to the synergy effects of multiple transition metal heteroatoms, and the durable stability may stem from the distorted structures of spinel trimetallic sulfides. Encouragingly, the Cu0.5Ni0.5Co2S4 CE exhibits the best stability, and achieves a PCE of 5.20% assembled with the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode for QDSSCs, which indicates that spinel trimetallic sulfides are promising efficient and stable materials for QDSSCs.
