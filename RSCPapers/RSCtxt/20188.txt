    , Accepted 31st March 2022First published on 2nd April 2022AbstractHalide ion passivation is an effective way to improve the stability and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells. In this work, the passivation mechanism of the surface iodine vacancies of inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 films by halogen ions (F−, Cl−, and Br−) has been studied using the first-principles method. Due to its high electronegativity, the F ion withdraws electron density out of its neighboring atoms, readily forms ionic bonds with Pb atoms and has a coupling effect with the nearest neighbor Cs atoms, which can alleviate the generation of cation vacancy and ion migration to locally stabilize the structure of the perovskite. The fluorinated CsPbI3 (001) surface has a lower surface energy, which improves the grain growth of perovskite films. Different from F−, the passivation via Cl− or Br− ions can effectively prevent the charge accumulation on the film surface, reduce the exciton binding energy of CsPbI3, and eliminate the loss of optical absorption intensity in the visible light range caused by iodine vacancies. These results provide a deep understanding about surface passivation by halogen ions for perovskite solar cells.
1. Introduction
The inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite has been extensively explored due to its tunable band gap, good chemical stability and simple synthetic process.1 Substituting an organic cation with Cs+ can avoid high-temperature decomposition of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites and improve the stability under humidity and light conditions.2,3 At present, the PCE of CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has exceeded 20%.4 However, the defect density of the CsPbI3 perovskite layer remains relatively high, and the non-radiative recombination leads to a large open-circuit voltage loss of PSCs. Up to now, the highest PCE of CsPbI3 PSCs still cannot surpass that of organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs.
It is known that there are uncoordinated cations (Pb2+ and Cs+), vacancies (such as VPb and VI) and anti-site defects (such as IPb and CsI) on the surface and interfaces of CsPbI3 perovskites. Many experiments have found that during the preparation of perovskite films, VI tends to accumulate on the film surface.5,6 Theoretical calculations show that different from the VI in the bulk, the surface VI will form a defect state in the forbidden band.7,8 The electronic behavior of the iodine vacancy structure in hybrid perovskites is more like a DX center, making the defect that should be a shallow donor level actually appear as a deep acceptor level.9 Halogen vacancies will increase the absorption of water molecules and accelerate the degradation of the perovskite.10
Halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br and I) constitute the seventh main group, and have similar characteristics of extranuclear electron arrangement. Many organic or inorganic passivators including halide ions can reduce exciton binding energy, increase carrier mobility, decrease non-radiative recombination11 and promote the film growth of PSCs.12 Fluoride doping in lead iodide perovskites was unexplored until 2019.13 Li et al. firstly dissolved 0.1% NaF salts in triple cation (mixed Cs/MA/FA) perovskite precursor solutions and theoretically concluded that passivation with fluoride increased the formation energy of formamide (FA) cation vacancies in hybrid perovskites through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Also, they experimentally observed that after adding NaCl or NaF, the grain size of the hybrid perovskite film was slightly larger than that after adding NaBr or NaI.5 Zheng et al.14,15 used KF salt and a fluorinated organic ammonium salt to passivate CsPbI2Br PSCs with efficiencies of over 15 and 16%. Yang et al.16 used poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) to passivate CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots with superior stability, and investigated the existing interaction between the electronegative –CF2– group in the PVDF chain and Cs+ ion in CsPbBr3. Fu et al.17 stabilized the black phase of CsPbBrI2 by using PbF2 as a precursor, and they interpreted that the phase stability was promoted by a reduction in the lattice parameter with increasing bulk F content. However, the evidence cited above reveals the difficulty of bulk F incorporation and further investigation is needed.
Zhao et al.18 developed a Cl-passivated CsPbI3 perovskite and obtained a power conversion efficiency of 19.03%. Ye et al.19 added lead chloride to the CsPbI3−xBrx precursor to increase the grain size and showed that the open-circuit voltage of the PSC reached 1.25 V and the PCE reached 18.64%. Li et al.20 and Zhu et al.6 designed a Cl-containing tin-based electron transport layer SnOx–Cl, and found that Cl− spontaneously exchanged with I− in the perovskite film, effectively passivating defects and promoting the longitudinal growth of crystal grains. Liu et al.21 added SnCl2 during the synthesis of CsPbI3 nanocrystals (NCs) and found that the Cl− ion passivated the surface defects, which enhanced the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and prolonged emission lifetime. Recent DFT calculations about FAPbI3 showed that Cl− doping enhanced the interaction between FA+ and I−, and helped to improve the structural stability of the perovskite.12
Thanks to the appropriate ionic radius and electronegativity, Br− can replace I− in the PbI6 octahedron.22 Sutton et al.23 found that the introduction of Br− ions significantly improved the thermal stability of inorganic perovskites in air. Liang et al.24 investigated native defects in CsPbI3 through DFT calculations and prepared CsPbI3:Br:InI3 through defect engineering by introducing Br− and In3+ to suppress the defect density, achieving a lower recombination rate and an enhanced light absorption. Zhao et al.25 passivated CsPbI3 with phenyltrimethylammonium bromide (PTABr) and obtained an efficiency of more than 17%. They found that Br− not only passivated surface defects, but also induced crystal grain growth, and that Br− easily exchanged with I− to form a gradient doping, which enabled CsPbI3 to maintain the black perovskite phase under humid conditions.25
According to the above experimental and theoretical works, it can be concluded that halide ions (F−, Cl− and Br−) contained in organic or inorganic passivators play significant roles in passivating PSCs. However, the theoretical studies lag behind in understanding these passivation processes and there have been very few studies on fluorinated lead halide perovskites, which warrant further investigation into fluorination effects and synthetic routes.13 In order to help to achieve high-efficiency and stable CsPbI3 PSCs and reveal the physical mechanism of surface passivation, the present work investigates the passivation of iodine vacancies by halogen ions (F−, Cl− and Br−) using a first-principles method, and systematically compares the electronic structures and optical properties of CsPbI3 perovskite films with different passivators.
2. Computational details and models
In this work, all DFT calculations used the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method,26 as implemented in the VASP code.27 All structural relaxation and optical properties were calculated using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation functional.28 After the convergence test, a cutoff energy of 500 eV and an electron energy convergence criterion of 1 × 10−6 eV were selected as the calculation parameters. The atomic position was relaxed until the force was less than 0.001 eV Å−1. The 2 × 2 × 1 and 4 × 4 × 1 k-point grid samplings in the Brillouin zone were used for structural optimization and electronic property calculations, respectively. Because lead is a heavy metal, there is a strong relativistic effect between lead and halogen atoms.29 Thus, the spin orbit coupling (SOC) effect was considered in all DFT calculations in this work.
In cubic CsPbI3 cells, Pb2+ at the B site forms the Pb–I octahedron with the surrounding six I− ions and Cs+ is positioned at a corner.30 The source of the cubic CsPbI3 crystal structure (1 Cs atom, 1 Pb atom, and 3 I atoms) is the ICSD (code 161481). The structure was first prepared by Trots et al. in 2008.31 Firstly, the optimized lattice parameter of the cubic CsPbI3 unit cell was 6.387 Å, which was in agreement with the experimental measurement of 6.289 Å.31,32 A 2 × 2 supercell based on the optimized cell model in the ab plane was established. There were PbI2 layers and CsI layers alternately stacked along the [001] direction of CsPbI3. According to the previous reports, the formation energies of iodine vacancies on PbI2 and CsI terminations were approximate, and also the surface energy of PbI2 termination was slightly lower than that of CsI termination.33 We calculated the absorption spectra of 9-layer films with the CsI-terminated and PbI2-terminated surfaces, and the results showed that the absorption intensity of the PbI2-terminated surface was significantly higher than that of the CsI surface (see Fig. S1(a), ESI†). Therefore, the present work selected the PbI2-terminated CsPbI3 (001) film to investigate the surface passivation. In order to test the influence of the size effect on the calculations, the optical properties of films with different thickness were investigated (see Fig. S1(b), ESI†). Considering the calculation cost, a 9-layer film model containing 92 atoms with a vacuum layer of 20 Å was selected. The simulation cell vectors in x and y directions, i.e. a and b are shown in Fig. 1. In addition, we also investigated the formation energies of iodine vacancies in the outermost and second layers of the CsPbI3 (001) film. It was found that the formation energy of iodine vacancy in the subsurface was 0.6 eV higher than that in the outermost layer, indicating that iodine vacancies were more likely to exist in the outermost layer of grain boundaries or the interfaces of CsPbI3.6 Therefore, the passivation of surface iodine vacancies by halogen ions (F−, Cl− and Br−) was emphasized in the present work.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Atomic structure influenced by surface passivation
The passivation of surface defects firstly influenced the atomic structure of perovskites. Due to the different atomic radii and electronegativities, the three halogen atoms (F, Cl, and Br) coordinated with surface atoms via various patterns. Fig. 2 shows the Pb–X bond length and the I–Pb–I bond angle next to the defect site. After the iodine vacancy was passivated by a Cl− or Br− ion, the Pb–X bond length and the I–Pb–I bond angle near the defect were almost the same as those in the perfect structure. However, the passivation by F− had a great impact on the surface structure. The addition of F− at the iodine vacancy sharply reduced the Pb–F bond length and the neighboring I–Pb–I bond angle. Here, the Pb–F bond (2.371 Å) was reduced by about 25% compared with the Pb–I bond (3.207 Å) in the perfect structure. The reduction of bond length meant that the interaction between Pb2+ and halogen ions was enhanced, which would be beneficial to inhibit Pb vacancies, ion migration and then the degradation of the perovskite. At the same time, the passivation by F− decreased the nearest neighboring I–Pb–I bond angle from 175° to 160° and induced a large distortion of the Pb–I octahedron. Among these halogens, F had the highest electronegativity (4.1) and the smallest ionic radius (1.33 Å); hence it was easier to fill the iodine vacancy and it bonded with the Pb2+ ion to locally stabilize the structure. Additionally, the larger lattice distortion induced by F− indicated that it was easier for the F− ion to exist on the surface than in the bulk for passivation. The present results are consistent with the statement in ref. 34 and explain the obvious change of the surface structure after passivation.5

3.2 Surface energy of CsPbI3 (001) after passivation
Extensive experiments have shown that surface passivation has an important effect on the crystal grain size and the smoothness of perovskite films.35–39 Theoretically, it has been found that the difference in the surface energy can supply an additional driving force for the growth of secondary grains in thin films.35 The minimization of surface energy will lead to the growth of larger orientation. Thus, the reduction of the surface energy after passivation can improve the driving force and promote the grain growth.36–39 In this work, we predicted the effect of halogen ion passivation on the growth morphology of thin films by calculating the surface energy of CsPbI3 (001). Here, the surface energy Ω1 of a perfect or defective surface was calculated as follows:40–42 (1)where S is the surface area,  is the total energy of the system, and NCs, NPb and NX are the numbers of Cs, Pb and I atoms in the system, respectively. μCs, μPb and μX represent the chemical potentials of Cs, Pb and I atoms, respectively. The chemical potential range for stable CsPbI3 and the used values of chemical potential are shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1 (ESI†), respectively.
The energy difference between the relaxed and unrelaxed passivated CsPbI3 (001) surfaces Ω2 was defined as follows:42 (2)where Eslab,relpassivatedslab and Eslab,unrelpassivatedslab are the total energies of relaxed and unrelaxed passivated CsPbI3 (001) surfaces, respectively. Thus, the calculated surface energies of passivated surfaces Ω were obtained as follows: Ω = Ω1 + Ω2(3)
The calculated surface energies are shown in Fig. 3a for perfect, defective and passivated CsPbI3 (001) surfaces under various environment conditions. For the defect-free structure, the surface energy of 6.04 meV Å−2 was the lowest under the Pb-rich conditions, while the surface energy was higher under moderate conditions.
 Fig. 3  Surface energy (a) and formation energy (b) of perfect, defective and passivated CsPbI3 (001) surfaces by halogens. 
When the iodine vacancy defect appeared on the surface, the surface energy increased to 9.47 meV Å−2. After the halogen ion passivation, however, the surface energy decreased significantly. The result indicated that the halogen ion passivation enhanced the thermodynamic stability of the defective perovskite surface. Under the Pb-rich conditions, the surface energies of systems passivated by F−, Cl− and Br− were 2.78, 6.29 and 6.81 meV Å−2, respectively. For the F−-passivated structure, the surface energies significantly decreased under three environment conditions, even lower than that of a defect-free surface. For the systems passivated by Cl− and Br−, the three environment conditions resulted in lower surface energies, similar to the F−-passivated structure. The results showed that compared with Cl− and Br− ions, the passivators including F− ions were inclined to reduce the surface energy of perovskite films and promote grain growth.
In order to study the structural stability of the films after passivation, it was also necessary to understand the formation energy of the passivated system. The calculation formula was as follows:43 (4)where E(defect) was the total energy of the defective or passivated system, E(perfect) was the total energy of perfect system, ni was the number of added (ni < 0) or deleted (ni > 0) atoms, μi was the chemical potential of corresponding atoms, and 2 shows there were two vacancies in the upper and lower terminations in the slab model, respectively.
The calculated formation energies are shown in Fig. 3b for the iodine-vacancy and passivated structures. The formation energy of the iodine vacancy was higher under I-rich conditions than that under Pb-rich and moderate conditions, which suggests that it was more difficult to form the iodine vacancy when the amount of iodine was sufficient in the environment. All the calculated formation energies were negative for the three passivation structures, indicating that these passivation processes were thermodynamically favorable. The formation energy was approximately the same for the Cl− and Br− passivation systems and was the lowest for the F− passivation system, as the F atom was easily coordinated with the neighboring cations due to the strong electronegativity. According to the various surface energies and formation energies of passivation systems, compared with Cl− and Br−, F− played an outstanding role in reducing the surface energy, improving the stability of structure, promoting grain growth and achieving effective passivation,19,44 which was beneficial to obtain larger grains, and more uniform and smooth perovskite films.5 Therefore, the present results disclosed the distinct roles of halogen ions in surface passivation and film growth, and provided a theoretical guidance for preparing perovskite films.
3.3 Effect of halogen passivation on the electronic structure of CsPbI3
Firstly, the density of states (DOS) and band structure were analyzed for defect-free and defective CsPbI3 films. Fig. 4a showed that the top of the valence band was mainly composed of Pb-6p and I-5p orbitals, and the bottom of the conduction band was mainly composed of Pb-6p orbitals. The magnified view of the states near the band gap is given in Fig. S3(a) (ESI†). The electrons of Cs made no contribution to the forbidden band edge, and the interband electron transition was mainly realized by Pb and I atoms.
 Fig. 4  DOSs and band structures of defect-free (a, c) and defective (b, d) CsPbI3 films. 
For the system with the iodine vacancy, a defect energy level appeared near the bottom of the conduction band as shown in Fig. 4b and the enlarged view of the regions near the band edges is given in Fig. S3(b) (ESI†). Due to iodine vacancies acting as donors, the Fermi level increased and entered the conduction band. The defective system presented the characteristics of an n-type semiconductor. It was seen from Fig. 4c that its band structure had a direct band gap, and both the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band were at the G point in the Brillouin zone. The calculated band gap was 0.57 eV, which was 1.16 eV lower than the experimental value (1.73 eV).45,46 This was mainly because the SOC effect usually underestimated the band gap of perovskites.47,48 The iodine vacancy had little effect on the band gap of CsPbI3 films. Yin et al.9 found that for CH3NH3PbI3, surface VI induced the formation of DX centers and deep defect levels. In hybrid perovskites, the generation of iodine vacancies caused serious lattice distortions and produced dimers, which introduced deep defect levels in the forbidden band. Unlike in hybrid perovskites, Cs+ was smaller in size and highly symmetrical compared to MA+, which meant that the all-inorganic framework could effectively reduce the influence of lattice distortion caused by the iodine vacancies, so there was no deep energy level caused by the iodine vacancies.
Next, the DOSs and band structures were analyzed for defective CsPbI3 films passivated by halogen ions (F−, Cl−, and Br−). Fig. 5a and d showed the DOS and energy band of the F−-passivated film, respectively. The regions near the band edges are zoomed in Fig. S4(a) (ESI†). It was clearly seen that due to passivation, the defect state generated by the iodine vacancy disappeared at the bottom of the conduction band. However, a new shallow acceptor defect state appeared at the top of the valence band. To make the origin of the new defect level clear, we attempted to use F− to passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ and calculated the DOS and energy band of the passivated structure. The results showed that the F− coordinated with surface Pb2+ did not produce new levels in the forbidden band (see Fig. S5, ESI†), suggesting that the F− ion itself would not introduce new defect states. The new defect state was generated after passivation only when the interaction between F− and Pb2+ distorted the Pb–I octahedron. This defect level could trap carriers and weaken the carrier migration ability, which was a disadvantage of F passivating iodine vacancies. In addition, as seen from Fig. 5a, in the energy range of −20.0–−22.5 eV, the electronic states of F− and Cs+ were very close, which indicated that there was a coupling effect between the two ions. However, the similar electronic states did not occur in the Cl− and Br− passivated systems. This result told us that F− ions not only passivated iodine vacancies, but also had a certain electrostatic binding effect on Cs+, thus contributing to the improvement of the perovskite stability.
 Fig. 5  DOSs and band structures of defective CsPbI3 films passivated by halogen ions F− (a, d), Cl− (b, e), and Br− (c, f). 
The DOSs and band structures are shown in Fig. 5(b, e and c, f) for systems passivated by Cl− and Br−. The regions near the band edges are zoomed in Fig. S4(b and c) (ESI†). In contrast to the case of the defect-free film in Fig. 4a, the DOSs of the two passivated systems seemed like intrinsic semiconductors, and there were no new defect levels existing in the forbidden bands. According to the calculations about the atomic structure, it was inferred that after the Cl− or Br− passivation, the deformed surface caused by iodine vacancies almost recovered to the state of defect-free structures. Besides, for the Cl− and Br− passivation, the difference of the electronic structures was mainly in the contribution of Cl− or Br− electrons at about −14.0 eV in the lower part of the conduction band.

Fig. 6 shows the three-dimensional charge density distribution of the conduction band minimums (CBMs) and the valence band maximums (VBMs) of the perfect, defective and passivated systems. In the defect-free structure, as shown in Fig. 6a and f, the CBM and the VBM were mainly contributed by Pb and I electrons, respectively, matching well with the calculated DOSs shown in Fig. 4. The electrons at the CBM were evenly distributed around the Pb2+ ions in the entire film system; the electrons at the VBM were mainly provided by the iodine ions and distributed near the film surface, which was beneficial to charge transfer. Seen from Fig. 6b and g, after the iodine vacancy was introduced, the I electrons at the VBM moved inward from the surface, and the electrons at the CBM emerged to accumulate around the Pb2+ ion neighboring the iodine vacancy. The abnormally increasing electron cloud density led to the enhanced chemical activity of Pb2+ ions and compelled surface Pb2+ to react with water or oxygen molecules, resulting in a decline of the device performance.
 Fig. 6  Three-dimensional charge density distribution of CBM and VBM of perfect, defective and passivated systems. The isosurface level is 0.00055 e bohr−3. 
After the iodine vacancy was filled by F− (as shown in Fig. 6c and h), the charge at the CBM was redistributed and almost recovered to the defect-free state (Fig. 6a). However, the charge density diagram of the VBM showed that there was an obvious charge accumulation on the iodine ions near the F− ions. This result explained the new defect state appearing above the VBM in the DOS calculation (as shown Fig. 5a). For the Cl− and Br− passivated systems (Fig. 6d, i and e, j), the charge distributions at the CBM and the VBM were similar to those of the defect-free system, and there was no additional charge accumulation generated on the surface. Through three-dimensional charge density analysis, it was found that Cl− and Br− ions provided an effective passivation to the trap states induced by iodine vacancies and played a substantial role in reducing the non-radiative recombination. We also provided difference charge densities of perfect, defective and passivated systems (see Fig. S6, ESI†). Red indicates charge accumulation and green indicates charge loss. Since the electronegativities of F, Cl and Br were stronger than that of I, these halogen atoms more easily attracted the surrounding electrons, leading to the accumulation of charge around them after passivation.
The carrier effective mass and exciton binding energy were calculated in order to clearly reveal the characteristics of iodine vacancies passivated by those three halogen ions and analyze the influence of passivation on the carrier migration. According to the effective mass approximation theory, the carriers of semiconductors were mainly generated by thermal excitation, and the excited holes and electrons were mainly located at the VBM and the CBM, respectively. The formula of carrier effective mass was as follows:49–51 (5)where k is the wave vector, E(k) is the eigenvalue of the energy band and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. A Coulomb-bound electron–hole pair produced by a photon absorbing by solid was called an exciton. Based on the Mott–Wannier exciton model, the exciton binding energy Eb was calculated by eqn (6):29 (6)where ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, μ is reduced effective mass derived from the formula , εeff is the dielectric constant and 13.6 eV is the Rydberg energy or ionization energy of the ground state H atom.
To verify the reliability of the calculations, we firstly calculated the effective mass and exciton binding energy of bulk CsPbI3 (see Table S2, ESI†), which were in good agreement with previous experimental52 and theoretical53 results. Table 1 presented the calculated carrier effective mass and exciton binding energy of unpassivated and passivated CsPbI3 films. The results indicated that the iodine vacancy increased the electron effective mass of the perovskite films from 0.123 to 0.133 m0. Also, the reduced effective mass increased from 0.074 to 0.111 m0. The enhanced effective mass reduced the electron mobility, indicating that more electrons were trapped by non-radiative recombination centers.

In Table 1, it was seen that iodine vacancy increased the exciton binding energy from 20.0 to 24.2 meV, indicating that the defect significantly inhibited the separation of electrons and holes. After halogen ion passivation, the electronic effective mass emerged to decrease. Among these three cases, Cl− ion had the most obvious passivation effect, and F− and Br− did not reduce the hole effective mass. The change of the carrier effective mass after passivation showed that Cl− ions remarkably influenced the electronic states at the CBM and the VBM to improve the carrier migration ability of perovskite materials. The calculated energy band and DOSs indicated that Cl− ions not only effectively passivated the trap state formed by the iodine vacancy, but also reduced the carrier effective mass. Moreover, in Table 1, after the CsPbI3 film was passivated by Cl− and Br− ions, the exciton binding energy was significantly lower than that of the defective structure, which suggests that the Cl− and Br− passivation could accelerate the separation of electrons and holes, promote the migration of carriers to the transport layers, and eventually enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency. Our results revealed the characteristics and physical essence of the Cl− and Br− passivation of the CsPbI3 perovskite.
3.4 Effect of halogen passivation on optical properties of CsPbI3
To calculate the optical properties, the complex dielectric function and the Kramers–Kronig relationship were used.54,55 The absorption coefficient α(ω) was defined as follows: (7)where ω is the optical frequency, and ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real part and imaginary part of the complex dielectric function ε(ω), respectively. As shown in Fig. 7, the iodine vacancy made a red shift of the absorption spectrum, and the absorption intensity in the visible light range was significantly lower than that of the defect-free structure. For the F− passivation, the absorption intensity of the defective structure approached that of the perfect structure, but the intensity was slightly lower in the entire range. In the cases of the Cl− and Br− passivation, the optical absorption spectra were very similar to that of the perfect structure, consistent with the measurement in the previous experiment.25 The results illustrated that during the passivation, besides reducing exciton binding energy, Cl− and Br− ions also recovered the absorption ability of the perovskite film to the defect-free case.

Conclusions
The present work has investigated the physical mechanism of halogen ion passivation for the CsPbI3 film using a first-principles method based on density functional theory, and the different characteristics of F−, Cl− and Br− ions have been discussed in detail. Due to strong electronegativity and small ionic radius, F− has an ionic bonding with Pb2+ and coupling with Cs+, which reduces ion migration and enhances the stability of the perovskite surface. F− ions play a positive role in lowering the surface energy and promoting the film growth during passivation. Compared with F− ions, Cl− and Br− passivation can effectively relieve the surface charge accumulation of the CsPbI3 (001) surface caused by iodine vacancies, reduce exciton binding energy and carrier effective mass, and play a substantial role in reducing the non-radiative recombination. In addition, Cl− and Br− passivation can compensate the reduction of optical absorption caused by iodine vacancies. The present results provide a comprehensive understanding about the surface passivation by inorganic passivators, halogen ions, for PSCs. In the future, the mechanism of organic passivators will still need further theoretical investigations.
