    , Accepted 23rd December 2020First published on 28th December 2020AbstractBipolar membranes are one of the attractive candidates for water electrolysis applications, because they enable hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to take place under their optimal pH conditions, thereby minimizing the overall cell voltage for water splitting. This study demonstrates the preparation of bipolar membranes using dual-sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) as a cation exchange layer and butyl-N3-substituted imidazolium-functionalized poly(arylene ether ketone) as an anion exchange layer. The synthesized bipolar membrane (BPM) was employed in an acid–alkaline dual-electrolyte water electrolysis system as a separator to restrain bulk neutralization. Results indicate that this BPM promoted water spitting reactions between the membranes at an applied voltage of 2.31 V and a current density of 160 mA cm−2 in 1 M H2SO4 and 2 M KOH without any deposition of water dissociation catalysts at room temperature. The BPM synthesized in this work also exhibited excellent chemical stability by experiencing a weight loss less than 3.4% in both strong acids and bases after 28 days. These results indicate that this BPM is feasible to be applied in the novel type acid–alkaline water electrolysis system to produce hydrogen energy.
1. Introduction
Water electrolysis has become a promising technology for hydrogen production owing to its several distinct features including simple processing, high abundance of water resources and zero emission of greenhouse gases.1–3 Generally, there are two types of water electrolysis: (1) proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis that utilizes a highly acidic PEM as a solid polymer electrolyte to conduct H+ ions from the anode to cathode, (2) alkaline water electrolysis that uses a concentrated aqueous alkaline solution to conduct OH− ions. In this case, electrodes are separated by a porous diaphragm.4–6 Anion exchange polymer membranes (AEM) are also currently developed for water electrolysis applications, but they are still at the research and development (R&D) stage.6 The theoretical thermodynamic cell voltage to decompose 1 mole of water molecule is 1.23 V at 25 °C and 1 atm. However, an additional amount of voltage is required in the actual water electrolyzer to overcome the kinetics and ohmic resistance in the system, in particular, the high overpotential of hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) at the cathode and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) at the anode.2,6–8 HER and HER electrocatalysts are known to be kinetically and thermodynamically favorable in an acidic medium, while OER and OER electrocatalysts perform the best in an alkaline solution.9–11 Because of this common fact, a PEM water electrolyzer usually suffers from the slow acidic OER and high incorporation cost of platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts due to the instability of non-noble catalysts in a highly corrosive environment. In contrast, alkaline water electrolysis that allows the use of earth-abundant catalysts has the disadvantage of low energy efficiency at high current density associated with the sluggish kinetics of HERs in an alkaline medium.1,12
The employment of bipolar membranes has been proposed in dual-electrolyte water electrolysis systems, as it offers distinct advantages that could overcome the drawbacks in the conventional single-electrolyte water electrolyzer. A bipolar membrane comprises a cation selective layer with fixed negative charges permeable to only cations and an anion exchange layer with positive charges that allows the migration of only anions. The bipolar membrane has been traditionally used for electrodialysis to recover acids and bases from aqueous salt solutions.13–16 Recently, many studies have been intensively carried out on bipolar membranes for new applications such as self-humidification fuel cells,17,18 CO2 electrolysis,19,20 electrochemical water splitting10,21 and photoelectrochemical water splitting,22–24 and reassuring results were obtained. When a bipolar membrane is incorporated into a water electrolysis system, it combines the advantages of both PEM and AEM electrolyzers by enabling HERs to preferentially take place in the acidic cathode and OERs in the basic electrode, respectively, thereby lowering the overall overpotential of the cell.9,22 It also mitigates the stringent catalyst selection for HERs and OERs, which is limited by the single pH environment in a conventional water electrolysis system.16,21,25,26
The operating principles of the bipolar membrane in different devices are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The bipolar membrane can operate under two conditions: either under forward or reverse bias condition. Water electrolysis is performed by a bipolar membrane under the reverse bias condition, where the cation exchange layer is positioned next to the cathodic electrode for HERs and the anion exchange layer faces the anodic electrode for OERs.22 Under the reverse bias condition, huge electric field is created in the interfacial layer to dissociate water molecules into H+ and OH−. H+ ions migrate through the proton exchange membrane towards the cathode and OH− ions permeate the anion exchange membrane and move towards the anode. When OH− ions reach the surface of the anode, the hydroxide ions will be oxidized into O2 by releasing electrons. At the cathode side, H+ ions accept electrons from the anode and are reduced into H2 gas. The H+ and OH− ions consumed for HERs and OERs are continuously replaced by the H+ and OH− ions produced in the bipolar membrane interface. An ideal bipolar membrane should have equal consumption and generation of H+ and OH− at the electrodes and the interface in order to maintain the pH gradient arising from the two electrolytes of different pH values.16
 Fig. 1  Bipolar membrane configuration in different devices. (a) In the fuel cell system, the BPM will operate under forward bias conditions, with the CEL facing the anode and the AEL facing the cathode. H+ and OH− will move towards the interfacial layer to form water. This system will provide internal humidification that can mitigate the durability issue of a conventional fuel cell system, which is often associated with long operational time. (b) In water splitting applications, the BPM is operating under reverse bias conditions, where the AEL will be positioned at the anode and the CEL at the cathode side. Under the application of an electric field, water molecules in the interfacial layer will dissociate into H+ and OH− and migrate away to the cathode and anode, respectively. 
Water dissociation reactions at the bipolar membrane interface occur via a proton-deprotonation process, which is catalyzed by weak acids/bases in the ion exchange membranes.22,27–29 It is suggested that the water splitting reaction takes place preferentially in anion exchange membranes because it contains primary, secondary, and tertiary amines that show catalytic activity towards the water dissociation reaction.30,31 When the PEM and AEM are sandwiched together to form a bipolar membrane, a thin intermediate region in between the two membranes is necessary to minimize charge-carrier depletion as well as to promote rapid water dissociation into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions. The structure of the junction and fixed charge densities in the respective ion exchange membranes are imperative in determining the performance of the bipolar membrane.22,23 BPM interface: H2O → H+ + OH−(1) Anode: 4OH− → O2 + 2H2O + 4e(2) Cathode: 4H+ + 4e → 2H2(3) Total: 2H2O → 2H2 + O2(4)
In the present work, we developed a new type of hydrocarbon-based bipolar membrane composed of a pendant dual-sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) (PAEK-SDPA) proton exchange membrane (PEM) and a N3-butyl-substituted imidazolium-based PAEK (PAEK-APBI) anion exchange membrane (AEM) for water electrolysis applications. Poly(arylene ether ketone) (PAEK) was employed as the main polymer backbone material to synthesize ion exchange membranes for its cost-effectiveness, and outstanding thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability, owing to the presence of the rigid aromatic ring in the chemical structure.32–35 PAEK-SDPA was chosen as the PEM because it exhibits thermal stability, mechanical robustness and high proton conductivity.36 However, the selection of PAEK-APBI as the AEM was ascribed to its comparably good anion conductivity as well as the enhanced alkaline stability of the imidazolium cations by the butyl substituent at the N3 position of the imidazolium ring.34 Additionally, PAEK-APBI contains an imidazole group that is known for its catalytic activity in water dissociation reactions. The bipolar membrane was prepared by a simple hot-pressing method. The properties of the bipolar membrane including water uptake, swelling ratio, chemical and thermal stability, and mechanical durability were investigated in detail. Additionally, water electrolysis of the cell that involves both acids and bases was conducted on the bipolar membrane to study its feasibility to be used as an alternative to the conventional monopolar membrane water electrolysis system.

Toluene, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), hydrochloric acid (HCl), N,N-dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO), methanol, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) were purchased from Samchun Chemical Company (Korea). Nafion solution (5 wt%) was purchased from CNL Energy (Korea) and Pt/C (40%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, Massachusetts, USA). Fumasep-FBM was provided by Fumatech (Germany).
2.2 Preparation of membranes

2.2.1 Preparation of PAEK-SDPA. 
Sulfonated 3-3-diphenylpropylamine (SDPA) PAEK backbone with carboxylic acid at the pendant site (PAEK-COOH) and that of pendant SDPA (PAEK-SDPA) were prepared according to the procedure published previously in the literature.36 PAEK-COOH was first synthesized from the step-condensation polymerization process between 4,4′-difluorobenzophenone, 4,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-valeric acid and bisphenol A. Bisphenol A was added to control the hydrophobic segment of PAEK. The molar ratio of bisphenol A (n) and 4,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-valeric acid (m) was fixed at n:m = 0.2:0.8. SDPA was synthesized via the sulfonation process of 3-3-diphenylpropylamine (DPA) with concentrated sulfuric acid. SDPA was then grafted to the carboxylic group of the PAEK backbone under the reaction catalyzed by TBTU and DIPEA. Then, 1.6 g of PAEK was completely dissolved in 16 mL of DMAc in a 80 mL vial. Following this, 1.3 g of TBTU in 7 mL of DMSO was added into the PAEK solution under vigorous stirring at room temperature. After 4 h of stirring, 0.86 g of SDPA in 7 mL of DMSO was added into the reaction mixture and stirred for 30 min. To prevent gelation, 1.3 mL of DIPEA was slowly dropped into the reaction mixture. After 48 h of reaction, the polymer solution was fed into the dialysis tubing and stirred in a beaker filled with 3 L of DI water for 3 days to eliminate unwanted impurities. The pure polymer was obtained after freeze-drying. The synthetic route of PAEK-SDPA is shown in Fig. S1.†


2.2.2 Preparation of PAEK-APBI. 
A butyl-N3-substituted PAEK-imidazolium-functionalized membrane (PAEK-APBI) was prepared according to the synthesis method outlined in our previously reported work.34 PAEK-COOH was functionalized with the NHS group to form PAEK-NHS, involving the coupling reagent of DCC. PAEK-APBI was synthesized through the amidation reaction of PAEK-NHS and 1-(3-aminopropyl)-imidazole (API). To prepare the polymer solution, 0.3 g of PAEK-NHS was dissolved in 5 mL of DMAc solvent until a homogeneous solution was formed. The solution was then mixed with 125 mol% of API and continuously stirred at room temperature for 6 h to obtain API-grafted PAEK. Finally, the imidazole group of the polymer was quaternized by adding bromobutane (2 equiv. of API) into the solution, followed by stirring at 70 °C for 48 h. The synthetic scheme of PAEK-APBI is depicted in Fig. S2.†


2.2.3 Preparation of the bipolar membrane (BPM). 
The bipolar membrane that consists of PAEK-SDPA as the cation exchange layer and PAEK-APBI as the anion exchange layer was prepared by a hot-pressing method. First, 0.3 g of PAEK-SDPA was dissolved in 6 mL of DMSO and cast on a Petri dish. The solution was dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h. The membrane formed was peeled off from the Petri dish and pre-treated with 1 M HCl for ion-exchange to H+. The PAEK-APBI solution prepared earlier was cast onto a Petri dish and dried in an oven at 80 °C for 24 h. The membrane was immersed in 1 M NaOH for 24 h to convert Br− into OH−. The two membranes were rinsed several times with deionized (DI) water to remove the excess H+ and OH− ions and completely dried in an oven before they adhered together. After that, the two pre-formed membranes were placed together and hot-pressed at 100 °C under 10 MPa for 5 min. The thickness of the bipolar membrane was around 170–190 μm. The membrane was stored in DI water prior to electrochemical testing. This fabrication process did not involve any water dissociation catalyst as the interfacial layer.

2.3 Characterization

2.3.1 Chemical structure identification and membrane morphology. 

1H-NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian Unity INOVA 500 MHz spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, California, USA) to confirm the chemical structure of the synthesized PAEK-COOH, PAEK-SDPA, PAEK-NHS and PAEK-APBI. First, 0.01 g of the polymer samples were dissolved in dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO-d6). FTIR spectra of the polymers were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm−1 in the spectral range of 4000 to 600 cm−1 using an attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Bruker IFS 66/S, Bruker, Germany).
The cross-sectional morphology of the bipolar membrane was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM7600F, Japan). The sample was coated with iridium (Ir) before FE-SEM observation. The elemental mappings of elements in the cross-sectional area of the membrane were analyzed using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS, Oxford INCA system, Oxford, UK) to identify the cation and anion exchange layer of the bipolar membrane.


2.3.2 Water uptake and swelling ratio. 
The membrane was cut into 3 cm × 1 cm sheets and dried in a vacuum oven at 85 °C to a constant weight before testing. The dry membrane weight (mdry) and length (Ldry) were recorded, followed by soaking into deionized water at different temperatures from 30 °C to 80 °C until the complete equilibrium was attained. The membrane was then quickly reweighed after the removal of surface water with a soft tissue at the evaluated temperature. The water uptake of the membrane was calculated using the following equation: (5)
The swelling percentage of the membrane was determined from the differences of the wet membrane length (Lwet) and the dry membrane length (Ldry) using the following equation: (6)


2.3.3 Ionic conductivity and ion exchange capacity (IEC). 
Ionic conductivity of both PAEK-SDPA in the proton form and PAEK-APBI in the hydroxide form was measured using an alternating current (AC) impedance spectrometer (Zahner IM6eX impedance unit, Zahner, Germany) in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 Hz. The resistance of the membrane was determined by a four-point probe method from the impedance spectroscopy plot. The ionic conductivity of the membrane was examined in a fully hydrated state at a temperature ranging from 30 °C to 80 °C. The ionic conductivity (σ, S cm−1) was calculated using the following equation: (7)where L (L = 0.425 cm) is the length parallel to the ion flow (cm), R is the bulk resistance (Ohm), and W and T are the width (cm) and thickness of the membrane (cm), respectively.
The IEC value (meq g−1) of the membranes was measured by a titration method. The dry PAEK-SDPA membrane after conversion into a H+ form was immersed in 20 mL of 0.05 M NaOH solution for 48 h. Then, the solution was back-titrated with 0.05 M of HCl solution using a pH meter (Orion 420+, Waltham, MA, USA). The cation exchange capacity (CEC) value was calculated using the following equation: (8)
The anion exchange capacity (AEC) of PAEK-APBI in the OH− form was also determined by the same method. PAEK-APBI was dried in an oven to a constant weight and immersed in 0.05 M HCl for 48 h. Then, 0.05 M of NaOH solution was used to titrate the obtained solution. The AEC value was calculated using the following equation: (9)where VNaOH and MNaOH are the volume and concentration of the NaOH aqueous solution, respectively; VHCl and MHCl represent the volume and concentration of the HCl solution, respectively. mdry is the weight of the dry membrane.


2.3.4 Thermal and mechanical properties. 
The thermal stability of the membranes was investigated using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, TGA2050, TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). The samples were heated from 30 °C to 600 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere.
The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the ion exchange layers was inspected using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, AutoQ20, TA instruments, New Castle, DE, USA). The membranes were heated at a rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen purge from the ambient temperature to 200 °C.
Universal tensile strength (UTM model 5565, Lloyd, Fareham, UK) with a load of 250 N was used to measure the tensile strength and tensile elongation of the membrane at room temperature. The membranes were cut into 4 cm × 1 cm sheets and equilibrated in DI water for 24 h prior to measurement.


2.3.5 Chemical stability. 
The chemical stability of the PEM in strong acids and the AEM in strong bases was determined from the variation in IEC values of the membranes after they were treated with 4 M H2SO4 and 4 M KOH respectively for 28 days. The membranes were removed from the solution every 7 days and carefully washed with deionized water to remove remaining ions. The back-titration method was used to measure the IEC value of the completely dried membranes.
The acidic and alkaline stabilities of BPM were also investigated by observing the weight loss of the membrane after immersing them into 4 M H2SO4 and 4 M KOH at room temperature for 28 days consecutively. Before exposing to the acid and alkaline aqueous solution, the water on the membrane surface was removed using a soft tissue and the membrane was weighed (Wi). For every 7 days, the membrane was taken out from the respective solution and the weight was recorded (Wf). The weight loss of the membrane was evaluated by calculating the differences between the initial weight (Wi) and the final weight of the membrane (Wf), as stated in the following equation: (10)


2.3.6 MEA fabrication and water electrolysis performance. 
First, 0.1 g of Pt/C (40 wt%), 0.858 g of Nafion solution, 1.0 g of DI water and 8.042 g of isopropanol were mixed and sonicated for 2 h to prepare the catalyst ink. The catalyst ink was sprayed onto the gas diffusion layer (GDL) for a few times in 5 min interval. A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was prepared by sandwiching both sides of the membrane with catalyst-coated gas diffusion layers and hot-pressing at 135 °C and 8 MPa for 5 min. An MEA with an active area of 6.25 cm2 was used in this process. Both anodes and cathodes were loaded with 0.4 mg cm−2 of Pt/C catalyst.
Water electrolysis of BPM was performed using the electrochemical cell system designed by our laboratory. The cathode and anode compartments of the assembled cell were filled with 1 M H2SO4 and 2 M KOH, respectively. MEA was assembled with electrodes and bipolar flow plates, under the placement of PEM facing the acidic solution, while the AEM was placed adjacent to the alkaline solution. The cartridge heaters were used to warm up the assembled cell. The electrochemical analysis was performed using a Zive SP2 power supply (WonATech, Korea) equipment. The polarization curves were obtained at 25 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C in the galvanostatic mode at a step current of 10 mA s−1 in the current range of 0–2 A. The water electrolysis performance was run for three times at each temperature, and the average value was recorded. The long-term membrane stability experiment was conducted at a fixed current density of 20 mA cm−2 for 12 h at room temperature.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Chemical structure characterization
The 1H-NMR spectra of PAEK-SDPA polymer are shown in Fig. 2. In PAEK-SDPA, the disappearance of the proton peak at 12 ppm (–COOH) and the appearance of a new signal at 2.10, 2.90, 3.97, and 7.20 ppm, which belonged to the protons of SDPA, demonstrated the successful conversion of PAEK-COOH into PAEK-SDPA. However, in the 1H-NMR spectra of PAEK-APBI, the proton peak at 2.78 ppm corresponding to –CH2 in the NHS group of PAEK-NHS was no longer present. The new proton signals appeared at 7.94 ppm (–NH from amide bond), and other 4 signals at 4.04, 1.67, 1.25 and 0.88 ppm (peak 14, 15, 16, and 17) were assigned to the butyl substituent resulting from the quaternization process of the imidazole group by bromobutane.

Fig. 3 illustrates the FTIR spectra of PAEK-COOH, PAEK-SDPA, PAEK-NHS and PAEK-APBI to recognize the functional group in the proton and anion exchange membranes. PAEK-COOH backbone was successfully synthesized, which was confirmed from the peak at 1710 cm−1 that arose from the –COOH group. In the FTIR spectra of PAEK-SDPA, two new peaks can be observed at 1121 cm−1 (OSO) and 1034 cm−1 (SO), which were absent in the case of PAEK-COOH. This can further confirm that the PAEK backbone was successfully functionalized with the dual-sulfonated proton-conducting moieties. While in the FTIR spectra of the PAEK-APBI membrane, the presence of the new N–H amide bond vibration peak at 1540 cm−1 indicated the successful introduction of the imidazolium group to the backbone via an amidation reaction between PAEK-NHS and API. Furthermore, the nitrogen heterocyclic ring peak of the NHS group from PAEK-NHS at 1204 cm−1 was no longer present in the FTIR spectra of PAEK-APBI.

3.2 SEM images
The cross-sectional morphology of BPM under FE-SEM observation is depicted in Fig. 4(a). Two distinct layers of the cation and anion exchange membranes can be clearly distinguished. Good adhesion between the two membranes was confirmed from the absence of voids in the interfacial layer. After applying appropriate heat and pressure, the two membranes were well attached to each other and the interface structure was smooth. The tight contact between the two membrane layers is very important to minimize the electrical area resistance in the transition region, where the water dissociation reaction takes place.27,37Fig. 4(b) and (c) demonstrate the EDS elemental mapping of the elements of interest: sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) in the cross-sectional area of BPM to identify PEM and AEM. The S element from the sulfonic acid group, which was highly accumulated in the lower and thinner layer, corresponded to the PEM, whereas a high concentration of N elements distributed in the opposite thicker layer was accountable for the imidazolium group from the AEM in the bipolar membrane.

3.3 Water uptake and swelling ratio
Water uptake and swelling ratio are other two essential properties that evaluate the bipolar membrane performance in water electrolysis. Water uptake of the ion exchange membrane reflects the membrane hydrophilicity, and it plays a very important role to conduct ions in the membrane. An appropriate amount of water in the membrane is needed for the facile ion migration via the membrane to prevent ohmic loss.38 As depicted in Fig. 5(a) and (b), the BPM was able to retain higher water uptake than the PEM and AEM without too much swelling. Under hydrated conditions, water molecules tend to diffuse through the bipolar membrane and interact with the charged interface due to the highly polar nature of both water molecules and the bipolar membrane. Furthermore, the water swelling behavior of the BPM could be suppressed by the low swelling degree of the AEM, the thickness of which was higher than that of the PEM. This explained why BPM has the highest water content among the three membranes but retained its swelling below 22% even at high temperatures.
 Fig. 5  (a) Water uptake and (b) swelling percentage of the AEM, PEM and BPM at different temperatures. 
3.4 Ionic conductivity
Ionic conductivity of the membranes is a crucial parameter to determine the bipolar membrane's performance in water electrolysis because it directly affects the efficiency of H+ and OH− migration from the bipolar membrane interface to the cation and anion selective layers when electric field is applied. A high ion transport rate in the membrane is very critical for fast HERs and OERs, as well as low voltage drop in the membrane. As shown in Fig. 6, both the proton and hydroxide ion conductivity of the PEM and AEM gradually increased with the increase in temperature. High temperatures enlarge the free volume, and thus, increase the water absorbance and ionic conductivity of the membrane.34,39 The proton conductivity of PEM was 0.0581 S cm−1 and 0.1146 S cm−1 at 30 °C and 80 °C, respectively, while the anion conductivity of AEM was 0.0049 S cm−1 and 0.0256 S cm−1 at the same temperatures, respectively. The anion conductivity of the AEM was lower than that of the PEM because the hydroxide ion mobility is generally slower than that of protons.40

3.5 Thermal stability and mechanical properties
TGA measurement was carried out on the AEM, PEM and BPM to investigate their thermal stability, and the result is presented in Fig. 7(a). There were mainly two degradation steps in all membranes. In the PEM, the first weight loss was observed at 260 °C due to the degradation of the sulfonic acid groups. The second weight loss starting at 400 °C was caused by the decomposition of the PAEK backbone. In the AEM, the first step of degradation commenced earlier at 220 °C, corresponding to the decomposition of the imidazolium groups. The second step occurred at around 350 °C and was similarly affected by the weight loss from the polymer main chain. Similarly, the BPM started to degrade at 220 °C due to the breakdown of the functional groups introduced into the PEM and AEM (sulfonic acid and imidazolium groups), whereas the polymer backbone degradation can be clearly observed at a temperature between 300 °C and 490 °C. The TGA curve demonstrated that the membrane structure of the BPM in this work is thermally stable up to 220 °C and is suitable to be practically applied in water electrolysis at elevated temperatures.
 Fig. 7  (a) TGA curve and (b) tensile stress vs. strain behavior of the AEM, PEM and BPM. 
The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the AEM and PEM were examined using DSC, and the DSC thermogram of the ion exchange membranes is depicted in Fig. S4.† The Tg values of the AEM and PEM were 147 °C and 150 °C, respectively.
Tensile stress and strain of the BPM in the hydrated state were also studied in the present work. The mechanical properties of the BPM in this case was dominated by AEM's properties because the AEM was considerably thicker than the PEM.40,41 Water uptake and mechanical strength of the ion exchange membrane are correlated with each other. Excessively high water absorption in the membrane will result in poor tensile stress because water acts as a plasticizer in the membrane.34 As shown in Table 1, BPM still displayed tensile strength at break at 10.77 MPa and elongation at break at 28.29% despite its capability to uptake high amount of water. This also directly proved the capability of PAEK containing a benzene ring in the backbone to provide sufficient toughness to the membrane.36

3.6 Chemical stability
Chemical stability is one of the crucial criteria in determining the long-term operation of the bipolar membrane because it is exposed to both highly acidic and basic solutions in the water electrolysis system. The proton exchange membrane should be able to withstand extremely low pH solutions, while the anion exchange membrane has to possess superior stability in high pH solutions.42 The IEC loss rate was used to evaluate the chemical stability of the PEM and AEM in strong acids and bases. As displayed in Fig. 8(a), the PEM and AEM were capable of retaining 96% and 90% of their initial IEC value under harsh pH conditions.
 Fig. 8  (a) IEC variation of the PEM and AEM and (b) weight loss of the prepared BPM after immersion in 4 M H2SO4 and 4 M KOH for 28 days. 
Apart from that, the chemical stability of the BPM was examined from its weight loss percentage in concentrated acidic and alkaline solutions at room temperature against time, as illustrated in Fig. 8. Chemical stability comparisons of the BPM from this study with the bipolar membranes in other studied reported in the literature were also done. EBPM-2 reported by Pan et al.43 has lost 1.85% and 1.33% of weight after aging in 1 M HCl and 1 M NaOH for 7 days. BPM-GO reported by Manohar et al.15 had a weight loss of 7.8% and 9.9% after immersion in 5 M HCl and 5 M NaOH for only 1 day. In this study, BPM experienced total weight loss of only 2.20% and 3.33% in 4 M H2SO4 and 4 M KOH respectively after 28 days of experiment.

3.7 Water electrolysis performance

3.7.1 Comparison of water electrolysis performance of the AEM, PEM and BPM. 
To study and compare the water electrolysis performance of monopolar and bipolar membranes under different electrolyte combinations, electrochemical testing was conducted on the AEM, PEM and BPM at different temperatures from 25 °C to 80 °C. The amount of catalyst loading at the anode and cathode for all cases was kept constant at 0.4 mg cm−2 of Pt/C. Water electrolysis experiments of the 3 above-mentioned membranes were performed with the following electrolyte pairs and concentrations: a single alkaline electrolyte separated by the AEM (2 M KOH‖AEM‖2 M KOH); a single acidic electrolyte separated by the PEM (1 M H2SO4‖PEM‖1 M H2SO4); an acidic catholyte and an alkaline anolyte separated by the BPM (1 M H2SO4‖BPM‖2 M KOH).
According to the water electrolysis performance illustrated in Fig. 9, the membranes can be arranged in the order of increasing cell voltage as BPM < PEM < AEM at all temperature to meet the same current density. Under similar catalyst conditions but different pH environments, the AEM in an alkaline medium showed lower performance than the PEM in an acidic medium due to several reasons: (1) excessive energy is required to break the H–O–H bond in the water dissociation step in alkaline HERs9,12 and (2) low efficiencies of the acidic medium-based catalyst (Pt/C) in a basic solution that requires high overpotentials to activate the catalyst.12,44 The water electrolysis voltage for the 3 above-mentioned membranes gradually decreased with the increase in temperature due to the decreasing overpotential of the cell at higher temperatures.

It is worth noting that the BPM with the use of dual-pH electrolyte configuration exhibited the lowest external voltage for water splitting in comparison with the monopolar PEM and AEM in a single pH electrolyte solution of either acid or alkaline nature. This can be attributed to the particular arrangement that allows facile proton reduction and hydroxide ion oxidation reactions in an acidic and a basic environment, respectively, which significantly minimize the total potential loss in the system.9 When the OER takes place in an alkaline environment, a lot of OH− are readily available in the KOH solution for O2 generation. OH− will be oxidized into oxygen and water molecules by giving out electrons. However, the elementary step of acidic OERs is different from alkaline OERs. H2O that acts as the reactant will attach to the catalyst active sites, and additional energy is required to dissociate H2O to form OH* before yielding O* intermediates. Then, H2O will attack O* to produce HOO* intermediates, which are desorbed from the electrode surface to produce O2.45
HER occurs more easily in an acidic medium because H2SO4 can provide abundance of H+ for the reduction process. In acids, H+ is reduced to a H* intermediate when it is adsorbed onto the active site of the electrode surface. H2 molecules will evolve either via (1) proton and electron transfer process of H*, or (2) recombination of the two adsorbed H* on the active sites.46 On the contrary, in alkaline HERs, H+ is absent and only H2O is available at the cathode to be reduced into H2. H2O binding onto the electrode surface in alkalis is known to be poorer than H+ adsorption in acids. Moreover, the strong covalent O–H–O bond has to be broken prior to the H* adsorption process. Due to these demerits, the water dissociation kinetics of the alkaline HER is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the acidic HER, leading to a higher overpotential in the alkaline HER.12,44 The fundamental mechanisms of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in different pH environments are summarized in Table 2 for a better understanding of the water electrolysis performance in different medias.

3.7.2 Effect of anode electrocatalysts. 
To further investigate the influence of non-noble OER electrocatalysts on the water electrolysis performance, a commercial nickel foam was introduced into the system to replace Pt/C as the anodic catalyst in an alkaline solution. The nickel (Ni) foam has been widely used as a current collector as well as a catalyst in alkaline water electrolysis owing to its several advantages such as low cost, high porosity, good conductivity, and excellent chemical stability in the alkaline medium.47,48 Most importantly, the incorporation of the Ni foam into the water electrolysis system could eliminate the use of expensive noble metal catalysts, which can directly reduce the overall hydrogen production cost. Due to the instability of the Ni foam in acidic solutions, water electrolysis performance with the Ni foam was only accessed on the AEM, BPM and commercial Fumasep FBM. Meanwhile, the other conditions like the amount of cathodic catalyst loading and the electrolyte combination remained unchanged. It is worth mentioning that the AEM water electrolysis performance became fivefold higher than the previous performance with the Pt (C)//Pt (A) catalyst pair. The low external voltage maybe associated with the 3D conductive frameworks and macroporous structure of the Ni foam, which can provide a larger catalytic active surface area to facilitate OERs in the alkaline medium.48 As displayed in Fig. 10(a), the voltage to achieve current densities of 20, 60 and 100 mA cm−2 at 25 °C for the BPM was greatly reduced from previous 2.80, 5.31, and 6.55 V to 1.59, 1.89, and 2.07 V respectively. Furthermore, in comparison with the BPM, Fumasep FBM displayed a higher external voltage of 1.71, 2.06, and 2.27 V to afford current densities of 20, 60 and 100 mA cm−2. The BPM in this study showed better performance than the AEM and commercial Fumasep FBM. This could be ascribed to the minimized interfacial resistance and also excellent ionic conductivity of both the individual ion exchange layers in the BPM that allowed ions to be transported at fast rates, although the water dissociation catalyst was not introduced into the bipolar membrane. A low applied voltage in water electrolysis is highly desirable because this will reduce the energy consumption in the hydrogen generation process.
 Fig. 10  (a) Water electrolysis performance comparison of the AEM, BPM and Fumasep FBM at 25 °C, and (b) water electrolysis performance of the BPM at an evaluated temperature. 

Fig. 10(b) shows the polarization curves of the BPM at 25, 40, 60, and 80 °C to analyze the temperature effect on BPM electrolysis performance when the Ni foam was applied as an anode electrocatalyst. At a low current density of 20 mA cm−2, the applied voltage at 25, 40, 60, and 80 °C were 1.59, 1.48, 1.46 and 1.37 V respectively. Conversely, the required voltage to achieve a high current density of 100 mA cm−2 at 25, 40, 60, and 80 °C were 2.07, 1.97, 1.91 and 1.72 V respectively. As expected, the required cell voltage to reach a certain amount of current density decreases as the temperature rises. This could be related to the higher electrocatalytic activity resulting from the elevated operating temperature that eventually leads to an increment in ionic conductivity of both the PEM and AEM in the bipolar membrane.7,9 For this reason, the activation overpotential of both HERs and OERs in the water electrolysis system is substantially reduced and more efficient water electrolysis can be accomplished. The above-mentioned result indicated that the water electrolysis performance of the BPM was remarkably improved by the incorporation of the Pt/C catalyst and nickel foam as an ideal pair of cathodic and anodic electrocatalysts in the acid–alkaline electrolyzer. Under similar asymmetric acid–alkaline electrolyte configurations, the BPM performance in this work was also compared with that of other bipolar membranes reported previously in the literature, and the result is depicted in Table 3.

3.7.3 Stability of the BPM-based cell. 
To evaluate the BPM-based cell stability, a chronopotentiometry test was performed at a fixed current density of 20 mA cm−2 at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 11(a), the water electrolysis voltage of BPM only slightly increased from 1.59 V to 1.65 V after 12 h of testing time. The slight voltage increment may be associated with a minor crossover of the K+ and SO42− co-ions in the electrolytes.16 The overall performance remained stable at 1.62 ± 0.03 V without huge polarization being observed. This result indicated that the BPM in the dual-electrolyte water electrolyzer was able to maintain the pH gradient formed between the cathode and anode chambers. The membrane before and after water electrolysis is also displayed in Fig. 11(b). The membrane surface was smooth and clear before water electrolysis. After the electrochemical test for 12 h, the membrane became slightly dented out due to the force exerted by the gasket and electrode, when the electrolyte passed through the cell, but the blistering effect was absent in the bipolar membrane. Blisters can be formed from the gas trapped in between the membrane layers when they are not mechanically stable enough.14 In addition, the photos of the bipolar membrane after immersion in deionized water for 14 days were taken, which are shown in Fig. 12. From Fig. 12, it is confirmed that delamination and shrinking did not occur at the interface of the bipolar membrane even though it was made of two different types of ion exchange membranes with different water absorption and swelling degrees. This further indicates the excellent compatibility of the two membranes, owing to the similar polymeric backbone structures as well as the strong electrostatic interaction generated in the interface from the two membranes with opposite charges.

4. Conclusion
In this study, a new bipolar membrane composed of a PAEK-based dual-sulfonic acid-functionalized cation exchange layer and a N3-butyl-substituted imidazolium-functionalized anion exchange layer has been successfully fabricated by a hot-pressing method. The bipolar membrane prepared was explored in the novel asymmetric acid–alkaline water electrolysis system, which was favorable for acidic HERs and alkaline OERs. Benefiting from the pH-differential operating condition, our BPM exhibited the lowest cell voltage to afford the same current density in comparison with the PEM and AEM in single electrolyte solutions. In addition, when water electrolysis was performed with a Pt/C (C)‖nickel foam (A) catalyst pair, the BPM outperformed the commercial Fumasep FBM by delivering only 1.59 V of cell voltage at a current density of 20 mA cm−2. After 12 h of chronopotentiometry test, no noticeable degradation in the bipolar membrane was observed. The contact area of the two layers of BPM remained intact without delamination from each other. The outstanding chemical stability in strong acids and bases as well as good water electrolysis performance of the BPM proven in this work shows that the BPM is very promising to be applied practically in water electrolysis to produce hydrogen energy in the future.
