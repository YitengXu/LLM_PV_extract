    , Accepted 5th July 2021First published on 6th July 2021AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) based on nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) have achieved rapid development benefiting from the near-zero donor/acceptor (D/A) energy offset. However, a specific mechanism underlying the highly-efficient charge generation remains an open question. Up to now, most of the studies only focused on the intra-molecular charge transfer (Intra-CT) character and inter-molecular aggregation structure of nonfullerene acceptor molecules, but ignored their inter-molecular charge transfer (Inter-CT) character. In this study, by emphasizing the intra-molecular A–D–A electronic structure and inter-molecular aggregation mode of typical NFA molecules, we propose a universal quantum model incorporating both Intra- and Inter-CT characters. We confirm that the Inter-CT character is intrinsically present in NFA molecular aggregates. Importantly, owing to the Intra- and Inter-CT synergistic effect, the excited state binding energy in NFA molecular aggregates can be significantly reduced (lowered to ∼0.05 eV). These results clearly demonstrate that the excited state in NFA molecular aggregates is a CT state with both Intra- and Inter-CT characters, by which the charge generation dependence on the D/A energy offset can be eliminated through rational design of NFA molecules.
Introduction
Owing to the rapid development of new nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) paired with high-performance polymer donors (D), the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) have dramatically improved in the past few years.1–4 Compared with fullerene acceptors (FAs), NFAs exhibit strong absorption in the visible to near-infrared wavelength range,5,6 tunable energy levels,7,8 a push–pull electronic structure,9,10 and various molecular aggregation modes.11–15 Combining these features together, different charge generation mechanisms in NFA-based OSCs are expected.16–18 In FA-based OSCs, we know that a minimum D/A energy offset of ∼0.3 eV is usually required for highly-efficient charge generation.19–22 However, in NFA-based OSCs, most experiments have reported that charge generation can still be highly efficient even when the D/A energy offset for hole transfer is small or negligible.23–25 Considering these reasons, a fundamental explanation is that the push–pull electronic structure of a NFA molecule induces intra-molecular charge transfer (Intra-CT).26 As an expectation, the exciton binding energy in NFA molecules should be much lower than that in electronic homogeneous polymers.16 However, in NFA molecules with only the Intra-CT effect considered, the exciton binding energy is still as high as 0.2 eV.26 In this respect, other effects were taken into account, such as hot exciton,27 interface electrostatic potential difference,28,29 electronic polarization,17 and especially the molecular aggregation.18
In addition to the intra-molecular push–pull electronic structure, NFA molecules can form various aggregates due to their anisotropic geometric configurations.11–15,30–39 Up to now, there has been growing recognition that an optimized NFA molecular aggregate (e.g., a three-dimensional aggregation mode) not only contributes to the charge15,30,32,37 and/or exciton32,37,38 transport, but also benefits the electron delocalization to reduce the binding energy of excitons18 or D/A interfacial CT states.31,39 Recently, Wang and Zhang et al. reported that charge generation in a blend of a polymer donor (PM6) and NFA (Y6) should be mediated by intra-moiety excited states (generated in Y6) instead of the traditional D/A interfacial CT states.33 Generation of the intra-moiety excited state in Y6 was further confirmed to be closely related to molecular aggregation, which is similar to the findings by Hestand and Spano,34,35 that is, the inter-molecular charge transfer (Inter-CT) state is generally generated when the molecular aggregation effect is considered. Therefore, the intra-moiety excited state is predicted to be an Inter-CT state with the excited electron and hole delocalized between ordered Y6 molecules. It implies that Intra- and Inter-CT characters might coexist in NFA molecular aggregates. What are the key factors determining the Inter-CT intensity in NFA molecular aggregates? Whether the excited state binding energy can be reduced to an expected value by incorporating both Intra- and Inter-CT characters, thus the charge generation dependence on the D/A energy offset can be eliminated in NFA-based OSCs.
In this work, we theoretically propose a universal synergistic charge transfer model incorporating both the intra- and inter-molecular pathways to clarify these issues. Specifically, we first build a quantum model for an A–D–A type NFA molecule, by which we confirm that the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) levels can be separately designed via modulating the intra-molecular electron-push and electron-pull ability. In addition, we compare the intra-molecular electronic structures before and after excitation. The results show that a significant Intra-CT character appears in the excited state, while its binding energy is still as high as ∼0.2 eV. Furthermore, the Inter-CT character is confirmed by constructing different inter-molecular aggregation modes of NFA molecules, by which the Inter-CT intensity and the synergistic effect are successively focused.
Computational methods
A–D–A type NFA molecular model
Despite the molecular diversity,40–45 most of the high-performance NFA molecules have some general features, such as a quasi-one-dimensional conjugated skeleton, A–D–A electronic structure, and sometimes π-bridges connecting the electron-push central fused ring group (D) and the electron-pull terminal groups (A). For instance, Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of three typical NFA molecules (6TIC, Y6, and ITIC), for which we also build a universal quantum model. The blue and orange segments separately represent the central D and terminal A groups, and the black segments represent the π-bridges. To highlight both the electron–lattice (e–l) interactions and the electron–electron (e–e) interactions in the molecule, an extended version of the well-known Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) tight-binding model is employed.46 In such a framework, the electronic Hamiltonian of the molecule should be partitioned into three main parts: He = HA + Hπ + HD(1)
 Fig. 1  (a) Chemical structures of three typical NFA molecules (6TIC, Y6, and ITIC) and the simplified model description. The blue and orange segments separately represent the electron-push central fused ring group (D) and the electron-pull terminal groups (A). (b) Schematic diagram of the A–D–A electronic structure of the molecule, where the electron push–pull ability is described by the on-site energy difference  between the central D group and the terminal A groups. 
The part of the terminal A groups HA (1 ≤ n ≤ 7 and 29 ≤ n ≤ 35) is written as: (2a)
The part of the π-bridges Hπ (8 ≤ n ≤ 10 and 26 ≤ n ≤ 28) is written as: (2b)
The part of the central D group HD (11 ≤ n ≤ 25) is written as: (2c)C+n,s(Cn,s) denotes the creation (annihilation) operator of an electron at site n with spin s (s = ↑, ↓). t0 refers to the nearest-neighbor electron hopping (or transfer) integral for a uniform bond structure, α is the e–l interaction constant and un is the displacement of site n. t1 and t2 are the symmetry-breaking parameters separately introduced to reflect the lattice features of the terminal A groups (see eqn (2a)) and central D group (see eqn (2c)).
To further consider the effect of heteroatoms X (e.g., S and N atoms) on the electron hopping in the central D group, we introduce t3 to describe the electron hopping between the neighboring sites of a heteroatom (see the second and third terms in eqn (2c)). In addition, the electron-push ability of the central D group is tightly related with the introduction of heteroatoms, whose contribution can be attributed to the heteroatom effect on the on-site energy (Δon) of a neighboring site (see the fourth and fifth terms in eqn (2c)). To describe the electron-pull ability of the terminal A groups, we employ  in eqn (2a) to represent the on-site energy of a fluorinated or chlorinated site. So, the A–D–A electronic structure of the molecule is achieved, and the total electron push–pull ability can be tuned by the on-site energy difference (,  without specific clarification) between the central D group and terminal A groups, as illustrated in Fig. 1b.
With the Hartree–Fock approximation, the molecular e–e interactions can be described as: (3)Here, the operator C+nCn means the sum over the spin index, that is, C+nCn = C+n,↑Cn,↑+C+n,↓Cn,↓. U represents the on-site Coulomb interaction strength and V∥ is the nearest-neighbor off-site Coulomb interaction strength.
The molecular lattice Hamiltonian is treated classically, where only the elastic potential energy is considered in a static scenario: (4)where K is the elastic constant between the nearest-neighbor sites. In such a framework, the electronic eigenstate  and the lattice structure un depend upon each other, which can be obtained by iteratively solving the static electronic eigenequation and the lattice balance equation (details in the ESI†).
Results and discussion
A–D–A type NFA molecular energy level structure
Based on this model, we first calculate the projected density of states (PDOS, see the ESI†) of the central D group (PDOSD) and terminal A groups (PDOSA). The calculated PDOSD(A) with Δon = 0.6 eV is illustrated by the blue (orange) curve in Fig. 2a. We can see that the central D group has a greater contribution to the HOMO, while the terminal A groups have a greater contribution to the LUMO. It implies that the HOMO/LUMO levels can be separately designed by modulating the electron-push ability (Δon) of the central D group and the electron-pull ability  of terminal A groups. In view of this, we separately calculate the dependence of the molecular HOMO/LUMO levels on the value of Δon and  (see Fig. 2b and c). We can see that the HOMO level can be increased more significantly than the LUMO by increasing the value of Δon, while the LUMO level can be decreased more significantly than the HOMO by increasing the value of . These findings are consistent with the experimental observations,41,42 which confirm the validity of our model description for an A–D–A type NFA molecule.

Intra-molecular charge transfer effect
We now consider the Intra-CT effect of an A–D–A type NFA molecule. Fig. 3a and b separately display the net charge distribution qn = e(ρn,n− 1) along the molecule before and after excitation, where the results with different values of Δon are also compared. In both cases, we find that electron charges transfer from the central D group to terminal A groups, that is, there exists an Intra-CT character in the A–D–A type NFA molecule. Compared with the ground state, the excited state presents a more significant intra-CT character. To give a quantitative comparison, in Fig. 3c, we separately demonstrate the variation of the intra-molecular transferred charge quantity  (i indicates the site index of the central D group) with the value of Δon before (red curve) and after (blue curve) excitation. We can clearly see that the transferred charge quantity of the excited state presents a more apparent increasing tendency with increasing the value of Δon. In the case of Δon = 0.6 eV, the transferred charge quantity of the excited state can reach up to 0.55 e.

(c) Intra-molecular transferred charge quantity QIntra as a function of Δon, where the excited state (blue curve) presents a more significant intra-CT character than the ground state (red curve). The inset in (c) shows the dependence of the excited state binding energy (EIExB) on Δon. (d) Dissociation efficiency (ηIEx) of the excited state as a function of the temperature (T) with different values of Δon. 
Different from the traditional Frenkel exciton formed in an electronic homogeneous polymer, the “exciton” formed in the A–D–A type NFA molecule exhibits an apparent Intra-CT character, and thus denoted as an Intra-CT exciton (IEx) state in this work. The Intra-CT effect leads to the relative segregation of the electron and hole distributions along the molecule. As a result, the binding energy of the IEx state is expected to be reduced. Here, we calculate the dependence of the IEx state binding energy (EIExB, see the ESI†) on the value of Δon, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3c. It is found that the IEx state binding energy decreases from 0.32 eV to 0.22 eV in a given value range of Δon, and the result is basically consistent with the conclusion by Forrest et al.26 Furthermore, we estimate the dissociation efficiency (ηIEx, see the ESI†) of the IEx state as a function of the temperature (T) with different values of Δon (see Fig. 3d). It is observed that the IEx state dissociation efficiency can be increased to some extent by increasing the value of Δon, while it is still less than 1% at room temperature. Therefore, although the intrinsic Intra-CT effect in an A–D–A type NFA molecule can reduce its excited state binding energy, it is not enough to make the charge generation free from dependence on the D/A energy offset in NFA-based OSCs.
Intra- and inter-molecular charge transfer synergistic effect
Now, let's further incorporate the inter-molecular charge transfer (Inter-CT) effect by constructing different inter-molecular aggregation modes, where three A–D–A type NFA molecules are included (labeled as M1, M2, and M3, respectively). As illustrated in Fig. 4a, we consider three kinds of aggregation modes, including a D-to-D type H-aggregation, A-to-D type J-aggregation, and A-to-A type J-aggregation.11–15 Interactions between two neighboring molecules can be described by the Hamiltonian HInter, written as: (5)where t⊥ and V⊥ separately indicate the inter-molecular electron hopping integral and e–e interaction strength between the vertical-neighbor sites of two molecules.  means the summation only for the sites over the coupling region between molecules.
 Fig. 4  (a) Three kinds of inter-molecular aggregation modes of A–D–A type NFA molecules, including the D-to-D type H-aggregation, A-to-D type J-aggregation, and A-to-A type J-aggregation. The Inter-CT character is schematically labeled, where the red arrow represents the electron charge transfer, the blue arrow represents the hole charge transfer, and the arrow width reflects the transfer intensity. (b) Inter-molecular transferred charge quantity QInter from M1 to M2 & 3 as a function of the value of Δon, where the results for different inter-molecular aggregation modes are compared. 
Here, we assume that M1 is excited, and an IEx state is thus inclined to form in it. How about the effect of the two neighboring molecules (M2 & 3) on the IEx state? Through systematic simulation of different molecular aggregates, we find that the net electron charges will transfer from M1 to M2 & 3 in any case, that is, an Inter-CT character can appear in a molecular aggregate. However, the Inter-CT character is obviously different for the three kinds of molecular aggregates. As schematically shown in Fig. 4a, for the D-to-D type H-aggregation, the electron-push and electron-pull groups of different molecules are coupled to each other, where both the electron and hole charges can transfer between molecules. Owing to a larger coupling area for the electron distribution relative to the hole distribution, a weak net electron charge transfer appears from M1 to M2 & 3. For the A-to-D type J-aggregation, the electron-push and electron-pull groups of different molecules are coupled alternately, where the coupling area for hole distribution is greatly reduced compared to that for electron distribution. As a result, the hole charge transfer between molecules is suppressed, and the net electron charge transfer from M1 to M2 & 3 is enhanced. In particular, for the A-to-A type J-aggregation, the coupling area for hole distribution is completely eliminated, such that the A-to-A type J-aggregation is expected to be more beneficial to the net electron charge transfer from M1 to M2 & 3.
In order to quantitatively compare the Inter-CT intensities for the three kinds of molecular aggregates, we separately calculate the variation of the inter-molecular transferred charge quantity  with the value of Δon (see Fig. 4b). We note that, for any chosen molecular aggregate, the Inter-CT intensity is closely related to the value of Δon. In the case of Δon = 0, the Inter-CT character as well as the Intra-CT character does not appear for any molecular aggregate. In cases of Δon > 0, the Inter-CT character appears simultaneously with the Intra-CT character for all molecular aggregates. The results strongly imply that the Intra-CT character is a precondition for the appearance of the Inter-CT character in molecular aggregates. When the Intra-CT reaches a critical intensity owing to a larger value of Δon (Δon > 0.2 eV), we can see that the A-to-A type J-aggregation presents the strongest Inter-CT intensity. In addition to the inter-molecular aggregation mode, the aggregation degree (or the inter-molecular distance r⊥) also impacts the Inter-CT character since it determines the inter-molecular electron hopping integral t⊥ (see eqn (5)). The quantitative relation between r⊥ and t⊥ is described in the Parameter details of the ESI.† Here, taking the A-to-A type J-aggregation as an example, we calculate the variation of the inter-molecular transferred charge quantity QInter with the value of r⊥, where the value of Δon is fixed to 0.6 eV (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†). It is found that the inter-molecular transferred charge quantity presents an apparent reduction tendency with the increase of the value of r⊥. In this respect, we can improve the Inter-CT intensity in NFA molecular aggregates by optimizing the intra-molecular electronic structure (i.e., electron push–pull ability), the inter-molecular aggregation mode, and the inter-molecular aggregation degree.
For the excited state in NFA molecular aggregates, since Intra- and Inter-CT characters coexist, we denote it as an Intra- and Inter-CT exciton (IIEx) state. Compared with the IEx state generated in a single NFA molecule, the IIEx state binding energy (EIIExB) is expected to be further reduced by the Intra- and Inter-CT synergistic effect. In Fig. 5a, we present the dependence of the IIEx state binding energy EIIExB on the value of Δon in different molecular aggregates. Interestingly, there exists a critical value of Δon, obtained as Δon = 0.2 V for the present values of the parameters. In cases of Δon < 0.2 eV, the IIEx state binding energy in the D-to-D type H-aggregation is the lowest, while that in the A-to-A type J-aggregation is the highest. Considering this reason, the Intra- and Inter-CT intensities are both weak in cases of Δon < 0.2 eV, such that the IIEx state binding energy is dominated by the inter-molecular delocalization effect owing to the coupling between molecules.47,48 Since the D-to-D type H-aggregation has the largest inter-molecular coupling area, the delocalization effect is the most remarkable, and the IIEx state binding energy is thus the lowest. This result is consistent with other reports that the H-aggregation of electronic homogeneous molecules is more conducive to reducing the excited state binding energy.49–51

With the increase of the value of Δon, the Intra- and Inter-CT intensities are gradually improved, such that the Intra- and Inter-CT synergistic effect tends to dominate the IIEx state binding energy. As shown in Fig. 5a, we can see that the IIEx state binding energy in the A-to-A type J-aggregation decreases rapidly with increasing the value of Δon. In cases of Δon > 0.2 eV, the IIEx state binding energy in the A-to-A type J-aggregation appears to be the lowest due to the most significant Intra- and Inter-CT intensities (see Fig. 3c and 4b). In particular, in the case of Δon = 0.6 eV, the IIEx state binding energy in the A-to-A type J-aggregation can be reduced to ∼0.05 eV, and this value is very close to the thermal energy (0.026 eV) at room temperature. Furthermore, in Fig. 5b, we show the IIEx state dissociation efficiency (ηIIEx) as a function of both temperature (T) and Δon in different molecular aggregates. In cases of Δon < 0.2 eV, the IIEx state in the D-to-D type H-aggregation has the highest dissociation efficiency, while it is still less than 1% at room temperature. In cases of Δon > 0.2 eV, the IIEx state in the A-to-A type J-aggregation has the highest dissociation efficiency, and the value can reach up to ∼70% at room temperature.
Conclusions
In summary, we have reported that the Intra- and Inter-CT characters intrinsically coexist in different NFA molecular aggregates. The Intra-CT character is a precondition for the appearance of the Inter-CT character, and the Inter-CT intensity can be improved by optimizing the intra-molecular electronic structure, the inter-molecular aggregation mode, and the inter-molecular aggregation degree. Importantly, owing to the Intra- and Inter-CT synergistic effect, the excited state binding energy in NFA molecular aggregates can be significantly reduced. Especially, in an A-to-A type J-aggregation, the excited state binding energy can be lowered to ∼0.05 eV, and the charge generation efficiency can be enhanced up to ∼70% at room temperature. It strongly supports that the charge generation dependence on the D/A energy offset can really be reduced and even eliminated in NFA-based heterojunctions. Therefore, to minimize the tradeoff between voltage loss and charge generation for high-performance NFA-based OSCs, we should improve the intra-molecular electron push–pull ability of NFA molecules, and optimize their aggregation mode towards an A-to-A type J-aggregation.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Chemical structures of three typical NFA molecules (6TIC, Y6, and ITIC) and the simplified model description. The blue and orange segments separately represent the electron-push central fused ring group (D) and the electron-pull terminal groups (A). (b) Schematic diagram of the A–D–A electronic structure of the molecule, where the electron push–pull ability is described by the on-site energy difference  between the central D group and the terminal A groups.

 	Fig. 2  (a) Calculated PDOS of the central D group (PDOSD) and PDOS of the terminal A groups (PDOSA) with the Lorentzian broadening parameter adopted as 0.02 eV. (b) Dependence of the molecular HOMO/LUMO levels on the electron-push ability (Δon) of the central D group. (c) Dependence of the molecular HOMO/LUMO levels on the electron-pull ability  of terminal A groups.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) and (b) Net charge distributions qn along the molecule with different values of Δon before and after excitation. (c) Intra-molecular transferred charge quantity QIntra as a function of Δon, where the excited state (blue curve) presents a more significant intra-CT character than the ground state (red curve). The inset in (c) shows the dependence of the excited state binding energy (EIExB) on Δon. (d) Dissociation efficiency (ηIEx) of the excited state as a function of the temperature (T) with different values of Δon.

 	Fig. 4  (a) Three kinds of inter-molecular aggregation modes of A–D–A type NFA molecules, including the D-to-D type H-aggregation, A-to-D type J-aggregation, and A-to-A type J-aggregation. The Inter-CT character is schematically labeled, where the red arrow represents the electron charge transfer, the blue arrow represents the hole charge transfer, and the arrow width reflects the transfer intensity. (b) Inter-molecular transferred charge quantity QInter from M1 to M2 & 3 as a function of the value of Δon, where the results for different inter-molecular aggregation modes are compared.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Dependence of the IIEx state binding energy (EIIExB) on the value of Δon. (b) IIEx state dissociation efficiency (ηIIEx) as a function of both temperature (T) and Δon. In (a) and (b), a comparison of the results of different inter-molecular aggregation modes is also demonstrated.
