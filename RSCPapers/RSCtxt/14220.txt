    , Accepted 1st June 2023First published on 1st June 2023AbstractThe collection of photogenerated electrons is an essential part of the photoelectrochemical process on a semiconductor photoanode, which is often a bottleneck in a particulate photoanode. Herein, by ingeniously inserting a transparent electron-conducting ZnO nanorod array into a particulate LaTiO2N photoanode, bridges for electron transport are constructed between the nanoporous micron oxynitride particles and the AZO substrate, which improves the photocurrent from tens of μA cm−2 to 2.87 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE. Furthermore, the electron transport in LaTiO2N particles is improved by increasing the electron carrier density of LaTiO2N micron particles. After a simple annealing treatment in an inert atmosphere at 713 °C, the electron carrier density of LaTiO2N micron particles is increased significantly as shown by EPR spectroscopy and Mott–Schottky analysis. The bulk resistance of an assembled particulate LaTiO2N photoanode is reduced with the increase of electron carrier density as shown by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The apparent charge separation efficiency on the photoanode assembled from annealed LaTiO2N micron particles is 1.6 times that assembled from as-prepared LaTiO2N micron particles, and the photocurrent for water oxidation is increased by 62%, reaching 4.66 mA cm−2. By improving electron collection, the conductive array insertion strategy together with particle carrier density optimization provides a method to increase the photocurrent by 2 orders of magnitude reaching the mA cm−2 level on a photoanode prepared from visible-light photocatalyst powder.
Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising way to deal with energy problems, which converts the sufficient but intermittent solar energy and stores it in clean energy carrier H2.1,2 In a photoanode, the core component of a PEC cell, photogenerated electrons are collected to the conductive substrate, which is an essential process of photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, metal oxynitride semiconductor materials, including LaTiO2N,3,4 SrNbO2N,5 BaTaO2N,6 BaNbO2N,7 LaNbON2,8,9 and so on, which are responsive to wide visible light, are not suitable for growth on transparent conductive substrates due to harsh preparation conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare semiconductor particles independently and assemble the photoanode. Due to the high potential barrier in electron collection generated by the loose connection of particles, the collection efficiency of photogenerated electrons is very low in the particulate photoanode. Although the theoretical photocurrent limit of LaTiO2N photoanode is as high as 13.2 mA cm−2, when the issue of electron collection is not specially dealt with, the photocurrent of particulate LaTiO2N photoanodes are only a few to tens of μA cm−2.10,11 Necking-treatment method has been developed to enhance electron collection and thus improve the photocurrents to the level of mA cm−2 on particulate oxynitride photoanodes such as TaON,12,13 LaTiO2N,14,15 and SrNbO2N16,17 by introducing nitrided compounds containing Ta, Ti and Nb, respectively. Though the nitrided compounds are effective in electron transport, the performance of the photoanodes is probably limited to the nature of the non-crystallinity or low-crystallinity of them. Another approach named particle transfer is widely suitable for particulate photoelectrodes to improve the photocurrents to the level of mA cm−2.18–21 The deposited substrate are light-blocking metals, which disable illumination from the substrate side.
Besides the electron transport from LaTiO2N particles to the conductive substrate, the electron transport in semiconductive LaTiO2N should be considered as well. Although the specific surface area of big-particle LaTiO2N is smaller than that of small-particle LaTiO2N, it has been found by Feng et al. that the performance of the photoelectrode prepared with big-particle LaTiO2N (ca. 1.5 μm in diameter) is better than that of the photoanodes prepared with small-particle LaTiO2N (from ca. 0.06 to ca. 0.4 μm in diameter).14 In the big-particle photoanode, the photogenerated electrons mainly transport in a LaTiO2N crystal particle and then transport to the conductive substrate; while in the small-particle photoanodes, the photogenerated electrons have to transport from an upper LaTiO2N particle to another lower particle and finally to the conductive substrate. The transport of electrons among LaTiO2N particles needs to get over a significant energy barrier,22 which hinders the collection of photogenerated electrons and reduces the efficiency of charge separation. Therefore, it is better to use micron particles in particulate semiconductor photoelectrodes. On the other hand, even if LaTiO2N micron particles (irregularly shaped micron particles or regular brick-like micron particles) are used to prepare photoanodes via methods of necking, particle transfer or array insertion method, the photocurrents for water splitting on the obtained photoanodes at 1.23 VRHE are mostly only 1–3 mA cm−2,15,18,23,24 and few works have shown the performance beyond 4 mA cm−2.14,25 This implies that there are other factors that affect the performance of micron-particle LaTiO2N photoanode.
In fact, in the earliest study of photoelectrochemical decomposition of water using single crystal wafer TiO2 electrode, the carrier density was increased by a heat treatment at 700 °C in high vacuum to reduce resistance of the photoanode.26 Although the attention to the effect of carrier density on photoanodes is gradually diluted with the popularity of nanomaterial photoanodes in photoelectrochemical research, the effect of carrier density of micron-particle photoanode should be investigated. On the other hand, our previous researches found that the carrier densities of LaTiO2N and LaNbO2N with low defect light absorption derived from La2TiO5 and La3NbO7 can be significantly increased by a simple annealing treatment at 675–750 °C in an inert atmosphere.8,27
Herein, LaTiO2N micron particles derived from La2Ti2O7 were simply annealed at 713 °C in an inert atmosphere, which successfully increased the carrier density of LaTiO2N. And then particulate LaTiO2N photoanodes were assembled via insertion of a transparent electron-conducting ZnO nanorod array. The photoelectrochemical performance for water oxidation on a particulate LaTiO2N photoanode was significantly enhanced by annealing the LaTiO2N micron particles and inserting a ZnO nanorod array, which improve the electron transport in the oxynitride photocatalyst particles and the electron transport from the particles to the substrate, respectively.
Experimental
Preparation of LaTiO2N micron particles
Pristine LaTiO2N micron particles were prepared via thermal ammonolysis of molten-salt synthesized La2Ti2O7 as reported before.10,27,28 Specifically, La2Ti2O7 precursor was prepared via molten-salt assisted reaction of TiO2 (Aladdin, 99.99% metals basis) and La2O3 (Sinopharm Chemical, 99.99% metals basis) using a mixture of NaCl (Aladdin, 99.99% metals basis) and KCl (Aladdin, 99.99% metals basis) as flux with atom ratio of La:Ti:Na:K = 1:1:4:4. The well-dispersed reactants and flux in an alumina crucible was heated to 1150 °C and held for 5 h in air, and then cooled to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1, followed by natural cooling. The product was dispersed in water with ultrasonic treatment, followed by multiple wash-filtration steps to remove the soluble flux, and then it was dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. The resultant La2Ti2O7 was nitrided to form LaTiO2N under an NH3 (99.999%) flow of 250 sccm at 975 °C for 15 h in a tube furnace. The as-prepared LaTiO2N is labeled as with LaTiO2N(as).
A part of the as-prepared LaTiO2N powder was then annealed in Ar at 713 °C for 1 h. The annealed LaTiO2N is labeled as with LaTiO2N(Ar713).
Assembling particulate LaTiO2N photoanodes via ZnO nanorod array insertion
Firstly, LaTiO2N micron particles were stacked on Al-doped ZnO oxide (AZO) substrates via electrophoresis. 20 mg LaTiO2N(as) or LaTiO2N(Ar713) powder was dispersed in 25 mL acetone with sonication for 30 min, followed by adding 10 mg I2. And then LaTiO2N micron particles were electrophoresed onto an AZO cathode under a bias of 30 V for 5 min with 200 rpm stirring of the suspension, using a parallel FTO anode with a distance of 1.5 cm. The bondless stacked LaTiO2N particle electrodes are labeled in the format of LaTiO2N–AZO.
Secondly, a ZnO nanorod array was grown between the AZO substrate and the bondless stacked LaTiO2N micron particles via cathodic electrodeposition. Before being put into deposition solution, the LaTiO2N particle electrode was immersed in ethanol, transitional ethanol–water mixtures and water in sequence as described before.29 Galvanostatic electrodeposition of ZnO was carried out with a current density of 0.15 mA cm−2 for 2 h in 10 mM Zn(NO3)2 (prepared from Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Sinopharm Chemical, Analytical Reagent) at 70 °C, using a Pt counter electrode. And then the deposited electrode was immediately rinsed with water and annealed under an NH3 flow of 25 sccm at 650 °C for 4 min in a tube furnace. The assembled electrodes are labeled in the format of LaTiO2N/ZnONRs/AZO.
CoOx was photoelectrodeposited from an aqueous solution of 10 mM CoSO4 and 40 mM CH3COONa (prepared from CoSO4·7H2O, Aladdin, 99.99% metals basis, and CH3COONa·3H2O, Aladdin, 99.995% metals basis).29,30 LaTiO2N/ZnONRs/AZO electrode was illuminated from AZO side with visible light (λ > 420 nm, 1500 W m−2) from a xenon lamp with a cut-off filter to avoid excitation of ZnO, and an anodic current density of 0.004 mA cm−2 was applied for 400 s. After that, the photoelectrode was rinsed with water, and then rapidly annealed under an NH3 flow of 25 sccm at 650 °C for 4 min. The obtained electrodes are labeled in the format of CoOx/LaTiO2N/ZnONRs/AZO.
Characterizations
The crystal structure was characterized by XRD (Bruker D8 advance, radiation source, Cu Kα; operating voltage, 40 kV; current, 40 mA; scanning rate, 7.88° min−1). The morphology was examined by SEM (FEI Nova NanoSEM450). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded at −169 °C (Brucker EPR A200 spectrometer, microwave frequency, 9.40 GHz; microwave power, 30 mW; center field, 3450 G). Mott–Schottky analysis was carried out using pressed LaTiO2N micron particles on an Al substrate as working electrode and a Pt foil as counter electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH 9.2 via addition of La2O3) on a potentiostat (CHI660E, frequency, 1 kHz) as described before.27 The potentials were recorded vs. SCE and converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale. Electrochemical impedance spectra of LaTiO2N/ZnONRs/AZO photoanodes were recorded at 1.00 VRHE (amplitude, 10 mV, 0.04 Hz–100 kHz) in 0.1 M NaOH.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical tests of particulate LaTiO2N photoanodes were carried out under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM 1.5G, 1000 W m−2) from the substrate side, using a Pt foil and an SCE electrode as the counter and the reference electrodes, respectively. In the photoelectrochemical water oxidation tests, 0.1 M NaOH was used as the electrolyte. Current–potential characteristics were measured with linear sweep voltammetry (scan rate, 0.01 V s−1). Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured at 1.23 VRHE under irradiation of monochromatic light from a tungsten lamp equipped with a monochromator. In the charge separation efficiency tests, the electrolyte is 0.1 M NaOH containing 0.1 M Na2SO3 as the hole scavenger. The apparent separation efficiency was calculated to be the percentage of the actual photocurrent and the theoretical photocurrent limit of photons with λ < 600 nm (13.2 mA cm−2), assuming that photons with λ < 600 nm are all absorbed.
Results and discussion
LaTiO2N micron particles
Single crystal nanoporous LaTiO2N brick-like micron particles can be prepared via thermal ammonolysis of single crystal La2Ti2O7 brick-like micron particles from molten salt synthesis.10,28 Compared with nanoparticles, the size of micron particles facilitates the transport of photogenerated electrons in particulate photoanodes.14 As shown in Fig. 1a, the obtained powder material is pure phase LaTiO2N with good crystallinity.

We have previously reported that the carrier density of LaTiO2N prepared via thermal ammonolysis of La2TiO5 can be increased by several orders of magnitude via treatment in an inert atmosphere at 713 °C.27 However, due to the nontopological structure transformation from La2TiO5 to LaTiO2N, La2TiO5 micron particles are transformed into aggregates of many LaTiO2N nanoparticles.27,31 A photoanode prepared from such LaTiO2N material has poor performance because of the difficulty of electron transport and collection. Therefore, the crystalline LaTiO2N micron particles prepared from nitridation of La2Ti2O7 were used in this work. A part of the LaTiO2N particles were treated at 713 °C in an inert atmosphere of Ar. As shown by XRD patterns in Fig. 1b, the obtained material maintains LaTiO2N crystal phase, but the diffraction intensity decreases compared with the as-prepared LaTiO2N. This suggests that the annealing process in the inert atmosphere leads to some defects in the crystal, which reduces the crystallinity. Herein, the as-prepared LaTiO2N material is labeled as LaTiO2N(as), and the LaTiO2N material treated in Ar at 713 °C are labeled as LaTiO2N(Ar713).
Increased Ti(III) species and carrier density in LaTiO2N micron particles
The defects produced by annealing were characterized by EPR. Electrons in perfect LaTiO2N crystals are all paired, but species containing unpaired electrons are generated when defects are present and thermodynamically ionized, which can be detected by EPR. The EPR spectra were recorded at −169 °C. It is shown in Fig. 2a that a weak signal at g-value 2.00 (3365 Gauss) appears in LaTiO2N(as), which may be attributed to O− or electrons trapped in oxygen vacancy.32,33 And wide anisotropic signals appear at g-value 1.99 (3380 Gauss) and 1.94 (3465 Gauss), which are attributed to Ti(III) species.34–38 As shown in Fig. 2b, the wide anisotropy signals at g-value 1.99 (3380 Gauss) and 1.94 (3465 Gauss) are enhanced obviously in LaTiO2N(Ar713), indicating a very significant increase in Ti(III) species concentration. Unlike XPS which detects species near the surface, EPR detects signals from the bulk. This proves a high concentration of Ti(III) in the bulk of LaTiO2N(Ar713). The Ti(III) species can be ionized at room temperature, which release electrons.

Mott–Schottky analysis was carried out to evaluate the change of carrier density in particulate LaTiO2N samples. According to the Mott–Schottky equation, when C−2 is plotted with φ, the slope of linear fitting equals 2/(A2eεND), and the transverse intercept equals EFB + kBT/e, where C is the capacitance of carrier depletion layer of semiconductor; φ is the applied potential; A is the surface area of the electrode; e is the electronic charge; ε is the permittivity of the semiconductor; ND is the effective donor density in the n-type semiconductor, which equals to the electron carrier density in the bulk; EFB is the falt band potential; kB is the Boltzmann constant; T is the temperature. Therefore, the slope is inversely proportional to the carrier density. In the test, Al sheets instead of transparent conductive oxide substrates were used as the conductive substrates in order to avoid the n-type semiconductor response of transparent conductive oxide substrates, like FTO, ITO and AZO. The potential range without faradaic current from electrochemical reaction but only capacitive charging current was selected (Fig. S1†), so that a simple RC series circuit was used to simulate the system and calculate the LaTiO2N carrier depletion layer capacitance from the imaginary part of the impedance. As shown in Fig. 3, the Mott–Schottky slope for LaTiO2N(as) sample is 6.94, and the slope for LaTiO2N(Ar713) sample is 0.0186. This shows that the electron carrier density of LaTiO2N(Ar713) is about 373 times as that of LaTiO2N(as). The Mott–Schottky transverse intercept for LaTiO2N(as) is about 0.00 VRHE, while that for LaTiO2N(Ar713) is about −0.11 VRHE. Therefore, the flat band potentials are calculated to be −0.03 VRHE for LaTiO2N(as) and −0.14 VRHE for LaTiO2N(Ar713). This difference is due to the rise of Fermi level caused by the increase of electron density in LaTiO2N(Ar713).

The temperature of the annealing treatment was selected following our previous work on photocatalytic water oxidation, in which 713 °C was the optimized temperature, and the treatment at a higher temperature brought in a lower photocatalytic performance as a result of more defect centers for recombination.27 When the concentration of Ti(III) is so high as to form Ti(III) aggregates, deep energy level may be generated, which become the centers for rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, resulting in a decrease in photo(electro)catalytic performance. On the other hand, the Ti(III) species with not too high concentration mainly arise from isolated anion vacancies or ON˙ defects, which can result in shallow level below the conduction band,39,40 and thus do not seriously affect the electron–hole recombination rate. The shallow-level defects (anion vacancy-Ti(III) or ON˙-Ti(III) species) are easy to ionize at room temperature to obtain electrons in the conduction band.
Assembled LaTiO2N photoelectrodes with inserted ZnO nanorod arrays
LaTiO2N particles were stacked on the transparent conductive substrates AZO by electrophoresis. In such a process, LaTiO2N particles were positively charged as a result of adsorbing H+ generated by the reaction of iodine and acetone in the solution, and then were electrophoresed onto AZO cathode, forming a film that looks even to the naked eye. However, the contacts between particles and AZO substrates and among particles are point contacts, so the channels for electron collection are very narrow.
In order to improve the electron transport from LaTiO2N semiconductor particles to AZO substrates, an array-insertion strategy, insertion of transparent electron-conducting ZnO nanorod arrays between AZO substrates and LaTiO2N particles, was adopted. In such a process, AZO conductive substrates also performed as seeds for electrochemical deposition of ZnO nanorod arrays. As shown by the XRD patterns in Fig. 4, there are only (002) and (004) peaks of ZnO crystal phase together with the peaks of LaTiO2N crystal diffraction for all photoelectrodes. These two peaks are actually the second-order diffraction and the fourth-order diffraction of the (001) crystal plane, which are attributed to the AZO film for the stacked LaTiO2N–AZO photoelectrode. The peak height ratios of ZnO (002) to LaTiO2N (112) for the assembled LaTiO2N/ZnONRs/AZO photoelectrodes are bigger than those for the stacked LaTiO2N–AZO photoelectrodes, and there are no peaks for other crystal planes of ZnO. This indicates the epitaxial growth of ZnONRs on the AZO substrate along the [001] orientation.
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of (a and b) stacked LaTiO2N–AZO and (c and d) assembled LaTiO2N/ZnONRs/AZO photoelectrodes. 
As shown in the SEM images (Fig. 5a and b), LaTiO2N and ZnO can be distinguished via morphology. The surface of LaTiO2N particles is porous as a result of nitridation of oxide precursor, while the surface of hexagonal ZnO nanorods is smooth from electrodeposition. The vertical orientation of ZnO nanorods coincides with the [001] crystal orientation of ZnO in XRD. As shown in EDX maps (Fig. 5c and d), the signal of Zn element is strong in the area of smooth hexagonal nanorods, while the signals of La and Ti elements are strong in the area of the porous brick particles. This is consistent with the attribution based on morphology. As shown in the SEM images (Fig. 5a and b), closely arranged nanorods with rod lengths of ca. 780 nm and diameter of ca. 120 nm make surface contact between AZO substrates and LaTiO2N particles near the substrates. Moreover, big nanorods with lengths of ca. 2000 nm and different diameters appear where the gaps between the substrates and LaTiO2N particles are big, which makes connections between the substrates and those LaTiO2N particles suspended as high as 780–2000 nm. This provides charge transfer channels for more LaTiO2N particles than the case only short nanorod arrays, so that more photogenerated electrons on LaTiO2N particles can be collected. Co-based cocatalyst for water oxidation was photoelectrochemically deposited from the solution containing Co2+, and then annealed in ammonia for improving the contact of the cocatalyst CoOx on LaTiO2N semiconductor and thus the performance.29,30 In the EDX maps of element analysis (Fig. 5c and d), it is approximately shown that Co element is dispersed over the photoelectrode. In the experiments of annealing at 650 °C under an ammonia flow, there is indeed volatilization of zinc oxide. After use for tens of times of annealing, there is a light gray zinc deposited on the quartz tube wall at the ca. 13 cm downstream away from the sample position. However, this phenomenon is not obvious during each annealing, as it is shown by SEM images that the morphology of ZnO nanorods is well maintained.

As the AZO substrates and the inserted ZnO nanorod arrays are transparent in the visible region, the light is allowed to enter from the substrate side of the particulate LaTiO2N photoanodes. This incident mode is beneficial to the collection of photogenerated electrons in a nanostructured photoanode41 and the assembly of photoelectrochemical cells compared with incident from the electrolyte side.
Decreased bulk resistance of particulate LaTiO2N photoanode
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was applied to investigate the effects of ZnO nanorod array insertion and increasing electron carrier density of LaTiO2N particles to the particulate photoanodes. The equivalent circuits in the illustration of Fig. 6 are used for fitting,42 and the resulting parameters are listed in Tables S1 and S2.† For CoOx/LaTiO2N(as)–AZO and CoOx/LaTiO2N(Ar713)–AZO, the bulk impedance is much larger than that of (CPE2//RCT), so the semicircle in high-frequency region of the impedance spectrum which exits in Fig. 6b does not appear in Fig. 6a. Therefore, (CPE2//RCT) is ignored during fitting the impedance spectra of CoOx/LaTiO2N(as)–AZO and CoOx/LaTiO2N(Ar713)–AZO in Fig. 6a. As shown by the electrochemical impedance spectra under illumination in Fig. 6, the series resistances are similar, ca. 13 Ω cm2 for CoOx/LaTiO2N–AZO electrodes and ca. 10 Ω cm2 for CoOx/LaTiO2N/ZnONRs/AZO electrodes, but the bulk resistances of the electrode are much different (Tables S1 & S2†). The bulk resistances under illumination are 106 kΩ cm2, 39.4 kΩ cm2, 53.4 Ω cm2 and 19.7 Ω cm2 for CoOx/LaTiO2N(as)–AZO electrode, CoOx/LaTiO2N(Ar713)–AZO electrode, CoOx/LaTiO2N(as)/ZnONRs/AZO electrode and CoOx/LaTiO2N(Ar713)/ZnONRs/AZO electrode, respectively. The bulk resistances of LaTiO2N photoanodes assembled with inserted ZnO nanorods are ca. 1/2000 of respective those without ZnO nanorods. This means that the electron transport is significantly improved by the ZnO nanorod array insertion. Moreover, the bulk resistances of LaTiO2N(Ar713) photoanodes are lower than respective LaTiO2N(as) photoanodes. It is indicated that the bulk resistance of the LaTiO2N photoelectrode is reduced by the increase of electron carrier density via the annealing treatment of LaTiO2N particles at 713 °C in the inert atmosphere.

Improved charge separation efficiency
In order to investigate the effect of decreased bulk resistance on the performance of photoanode, apparent charge separation efficiency was tested in an electrolyte containing the sacrificial agent Na2SO3 following the ref. 14 and 29. Photogenerated holes can rapidly be consumed on the semiconductor surface by Na2SO3 in some photoanode systems, resulting in a surface reaction efficiency close to unit. Assuming surface reaction efficiency and light absorption efficiency within absorption band of LaTiO2N are 100%, the apparent charge separation efficiencies are calculated,  where iph,real is real photocurrent (Fig. S3†), iph,lim is theoretical photocurrent limit, which is 13.2 mA cm−2 for the absorption band edge of 600 nm. As shown in Fig. 7, the apparent charge separation efficiency on CoOx/LaTiO2N(as)/ZnONRs/AZO photoanode reaches 1.2–23.6% in the 0.6–1.3 VRHE range, while it reaches 1.6–38.0% on CoOx/LaTiO2N(Ar713)/ZnONRs/AZO photoanode. The apparent charge separation efficiency at 1.23 VRHE is improved 1.60 times by the heat treatment of LaTiO2N particles in the inert atmosphere.

Enhanced photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance
The performance of the assembled photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation was tested with the illumination of AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) from the substrate side. The current–potential characteristics of the CoOx/LaTiO2N photoelectrodes was measured in 0.1 m NaOH electrolyte by linear scanning voltammetry at a slow scan rate of 10 mV s−1 with chopped illumination. As shown in Fig. 8, the photocurrents of stacked electrodes CoOx/LaTiO2N(as)–AZO and CoOx/LaTiO2N(Ar713)–AZO are very small (blue and purple curves in Fig. 8; rescaled for detail in Fig. S4†). The photocurrents at 1.23 VRHE are 0.011 and 0.036 mA cm−2, respectively. By insertion of ZnO nanorod arrays, the photocurrents are significantly improved. The photocurrent on CoOx/LaTiO2N(as)/ZnONRs/AZO photoanode reaches 2.87 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, which is 260 times higher than that of 0.011 mA cm−2 on the photoelectrode without ZnO array. The photocurrent at 1.23 VRHE is further increased to 4.66 mA cm−2 on CoOx/LaTiO2N(Ar713)/ZnONRs/AZO photoanode prepared from LaTiO2N particles treated in an inert atmosphere at 713 °C, which is 62% higher than that on CoOx/LaTiO2N(as)/ZnONRs/AZO, and is also 130 times as high as that on CoOx/LaTiO2N(Ar713)–AZO.

Moreover, the IPCE spectra of CoOx/LaTiO2N/ZnONRs/AZO photoanodes are measured in 0.1 M NaOH. As shown in Fig. 9, the IPCEs are obviously higher than that in our previous work.29 On the whole, the IPCEs of CoOx/LaTiO2N(Ar713)/ZnONRs/AZO are higher than those of CoOx/LaTiO2N(as)/ZnONRs/AZO. In the range of 350–400 nm where the excitation in ZnO nanorods contributes to the photocurrents, the IPCEs of the two photoanodes are similar. However, the IPCE enhancement ratio of LaTiO2N(Ar713) photoanode to LaTiO2N(as) photoanode increases with the increase of wavelength, and an enhancement of ca. 1.6 times is obtained around 500 nm. This phenomenon is consistent with the improvement of electron collection due to the increase of carrier density in LaTiO2N. The light extinction coefficient of LaTiO2N semiconductor decreases with the increase of wavelength from 400 nm,43,44 so the absorption thickness increases, resulting in an increase in the transport distance of electron collection, which makes the effect of carrier density more significant.

It has been demonstrated by our previous research that the array insertion method to assemble particulate LaTiO2N photoelectrodes can improve the electrical contact between the semiconductor LaTiO2N particles and the conductive substrates, and thus improve the performance to 1.3 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE under irradiation of 0.85 Sun.29 In this work, single crystalline brick-like LaTiO2N micron particles other than polycrystalline irregularly shaped micron particles were used in the preparation of photoanodes. The parameters of ZnO nanorod array deposition were optimized for this system, including the concentration of Zn(NO3)2, deposition current, etc. (not shown here). Besides the growth of a ZnO nanorod array with nanorod lengths ca. 780 nm, big nanorods with lengths ca. 2.0 μm are grown where the gaps between the substrate and LaTiO2N particles are large. During the growth of ZnO, NO3− in the solution undergoes a reduction reaction on the electrode surface where electrons arrive, which generates OH−. And then OH− reacts with Zn2+ to form ZnO. As AZO substrates are covered by electrophoretic LaTiO2N particles, more diffused reactive species can be obtained in the regions of the substrate far (>1 μm) away from LaTiO2N particles than those near LaTiO2N particles. This results in the growth of bigger and longer nanorods, which create conductive connections with more LaTiO2N particles, and improve the collection efficiency of photogenerated electrons further. As a result, the photoelectrochemical performance of CoOx/LaTiO2N(as)/ZnONRs/AZO photoanode in this work is better than that in previous work, and the performance of the further improved photoanode CoOx/LaTiO2N(Ar713)/ZnONRs/AZO is as high as 3 times that previously reported.29
Discussion of improving the collection of electrons from the particles
In powder photocatalysis, the steps of photoreduction with electrons and photooxidation with holes occur on the surface of the same photocatalyst particles, so photogenerated electrons and holes only need to move to the surface of the particles without transferring between particles. In contrast, it is necessary for the photoelectrochemical process on a particulate photoanode that electrons travel from the particle where they are generated to the conductive substrate. However, only extremely narrow channels for electron transport are formed due to the point contacts in the stack of semiconductor particles. Moreover, space depletion layers of electron carrier and upward band bending take place near the surface of semiconductor particles as a result of filling surface states and/or surface redox species, which brings an energy barrier to the process of electron transport through the contacts (Fig. 10, left). The width of depletion layer is inversely related to carrier density. The wide energy barrier near the semiconductor surface seriously hinders the electron transport through the contacts.22 This is different from metal point contact. As a result of the high carrier density, the barrier width in the case of metal-to-metal point contact is so small that electrons transport through the contacts by tunneling. Even though the transport channels among metal particles are narrow, it is not of so serious problem as semiconductor contact because of the high carrier density of metal. Therefore, the resistance of point contact for metal particles is usually acceptable, while that for semiconductor particles is very big due to the wide energy barrier and low carrier density.
 Fig. 10  Schematic illustration of improving the electron transport from the particles to the substrate and within the photocatalyst particles. 
The contact area of LaTiO2N particles to the conductive substrate in the particulate photoanode is greatly enlarged by the insertion of a ZnO nanorods array, which changes the packed point contacts to the surface contacts via ZnO nanorods (Fig. 10, middle). The current–voltage characteristics of n–n semiconductor contacts considering surface states can be described by the double Schottky diode model, in which the current is proportional to the contact area and negatively exponential to the height of the barrier.45 The surface contacts of ZnO nanorods to LaTiO2N micron particles provides wide electron transport channels. At the same time, the surface contacts probably minimize the electron transport barrier at the contacts caused by surface states on LaTiO2N particles because the surface is bonding to ZnO. Moreover, as calculated from the Mott–Schottky plot, the flat band potential of LaTiO2N is about −0.03 VRHE, while the flat band potential of a ZnO nanorod array is 0.04 VRHE.29 The potentials of CB minima are often roughly estimated 0.2 V more negative than the flat band potentials. The CB minima of LaTiO2N is close to and slightly higher than that of ZnO, so photoexcited electrons in LaTiO2N can transport to the substrate through conduction band of ZnO. Therefore, the electron collection is dramatically improved.
Due to the straight growth of crystalline ZnONRs, the electron-conducting ZnONRs are in contact with LaTiO2N particles generally from the bottom, or in minor cases from the side. LaTiO2N particles in the upper layers are hardly connected to ZnONRs, and thus photogenerated electrons in those particles cannot be collected in the photoelectrochemical process. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no such a report of a particulate photoanode that the electrons generated in non-bottom LaTiO2N particles are collected as efficiently as those in bottom-layer LaTiO2N particles. The electrons and holes generated in non-bottom particles contribute little to the photoelectrochemical process on the prepared particulate LaTiO2N photoanodes.22 Although it seems possible to fabricate a conductive network in contact with LaTiO2N particles to achieve the collection of photogenerated electrons in all particles, there are big challenges, including (1) the conductive network should not significantly absorb the utilized light; (2) enough surface of all LaTiO2N particles should be left for the place of hole reaction; (3) electrons in the conductive network should be hard to reach the surface to participate in the reduction reaction. Therefore, using big LaTiO2N particles in micron size and collecting photogenerated electrons in a layer of micron particles is a more feasible strategy to improve the collection efficiency of photogenerated electrons. This strategy requires low resistance transport of electrons in the LaTiO2N particles and through the contacts thereof. In view of this, the bulk resistance of a particulate LaTiO2N photoanode is reduced by increasing the carrier density of LaTiO2N particles, and thus the collection efficiency of photogenerated electrons and the photocurrent are improved significantly (Fig. 10, right). In this way, a high efficiency in collecting photogenerated electrons is achieved using single-layer LaTiO2N micron particles by the array insertion method, which avoids the issue of using small LaTiO2N particles in submicron size that LaTiO2N particles in the upper layers are hardly connected to the ZnO nanorods.
Particulate photocatalysis can be regarded as a miniature photoelectrochemical system,46 and a photoelectrolytic cell can be regarded as an orderly integrated and expanded photocatalytic device. Because of the similarity between the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical processes, photoelectrochemical tests are often used to characterize the charge separation in the particulate photocatalysts, such as SnSe,47 CDs/NCN (i.e., carbon dots decorated modified-carbon nitride),48 MAF-34-CoRu (a semiconducting MOF, [Co3Ru4(ip)12]Cl2) and NDA-TN-AO (a semiconducting COF) photocatalysts.49,50 The increased photocurrents were judged to reveal that the charge separation in the photocatalyst particles were promoted by the modification or composite in such researches. However, the issue of electron collection on the photoanodes prepared from these particulate photocatalysts was not specially dealt with, resulting in very small photocurrents of a few tenths to tens of μA cm−2. In such cases, it is disputable using the photoelectrochemical test of photocurrent as an indicator of the charge separation in the particulate photocatalysts, because the photocurrents are easily affected by the varied situation of electron collection in the particulate photoanodes, such as introduction of a component with good conductivity. Notably, the conductive array insertion strategy provides a possibility to compare intrinsic charge separation in photocatalyst particles via the photoelectrochemical test by solving the bottleneck of electron collection in the assembled particulate photoanodes. Therefore, the conductive array insertion method may be applied to the preparation of particulate photoanodes of those semiconductors in future, in order to bridge the gap from good photocatalysts to high-performance photoelectrochemical cells.
Conclusions
In summary, the collection efficiency of photogenerated electrons in a particulate LaTiO2N photoanode is enhanced by improving electron transport both from LaTiO2N particles to the conductive substrate and in LaTiO2N micron particles. Electron transport from LaTiO2N particles to the conductive substrate is improved by the strategy of array insertion. The contact area of LaTiO2N particles to the conductive substrate is greatly enlarged by changing the packed point contacts to the surface contacts via the ingenious insertion of a transparent electron-conducting ZnO nanorod array. And the photocurrent at 1.23 VRHE on CoOx/LaTiO2N(as)/ZnONRs/AZO photoanode reaches 2 orders of magnitude higher than that on CoOx/LaTiO2N(as)–AZO photoanode without ZnO nanorod array. Electron transport in LaTiO2N micron particles is improved by increasing the carrier density via a simple annealing treatment in an inert atmosphere. The bulk resistance of the particulate LaTiO2N photoanode under illumination is decreased obviously by the treatment, and thus the apparent charge separation efficiency at 1.23 VRHE is improved 1.60 times. The photocurrent at 1.23 VRHE reaches 4.66 mA cm−2 on CoOx/LaTiO2N(Ar713)/ZnONRs/AZO photoanode, which is 62% higher than that on CoOx/LaTiO2N(as)/ZnONRs/AZO, and is as high as 3 times that previously reported.29 It is demonstrated that the insertion of a transparent electron-conducting oxide array in a particulate photoanode is a feasible strategy for overcoming the bottleneck of electron collection and obtaining a high-performance photoanode.
