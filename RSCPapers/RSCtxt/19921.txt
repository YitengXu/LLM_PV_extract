    , Accepted 12th August 2021First published on 12th August 2021AbstractHere, new polymers named PBTT-Cn (n = 3, 4, or 5) have been designed based on carboxylate-functionalized thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units. The electroluminescence external quantum efficiencies (EQEEL) of pristine PBTT-C4 and C5 films are over 1 × 10−2, which are among the highest results for OPV materials. Through combination with BTP-eC9, the PBTT-C4-based film showed a high EQEEL of 6 × 10−4 and the Vnon-radloss is 0.19 eV. As a result, a high open-circuit voltage of 0.89 V and a satisfactory PCE of 15% were recorded in the PBTT-C4-based OPV cells.
As one of the next-generation photovoltaic technologies, organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells comprising electron donors and acceptors have attracted much attention due to their advantages of low cost, light weight, and excellent solution-processability.1,2 Over the past few years, the OPV field has experienced a rapid development with progress in material design, device engineering, and working mechanism, boosting power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) to approximately 18%.3 However, the relatively large voltage losses (Vlosss) in organic devices still remain as a challenge,4–6 resulting in the large deviation between the bandgaps (Egs) and open-circuit voltages (VOCs) of the devices. To further improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OPV cells, it is imperative to decrease Vlosss.
Theoretically, the inferior Vlosss result mainly from two factors. One is the driving force for charge separation, which can be evaluated by the energy difference between the Eg and the charge transfer state (ECT).7 Fullerene-based OPV cells usually possess large driving forces.8 With the development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), many donor:NFA blends with negligible driving forces present efficient charge generation.9 The other is the voltage loss due to non-radiative recombination (Vnon-radloss).1,6 The Vnon-radloss can be quantified by the equation , where EQEEL is the external quantum efficiency of the electroluminescence.10 For fullerene-based OPV cells, EQEEL values are usually on the order of 10−6.11 In these devices, low luminescent charge transfer (CT) states always form at the interfaces, which benefits the charge generation but at the cost of non-radiative recombination.4,5 Differently, for NFA-based blends with negligible driving forces, several studies have revealed that CT states are hybridized with the local excited (LE) states.12,13 The luminescent properties of the hybridized states are mainly related to the luminescent properties of pure donors or acceptors and their energy offsets.12,14 At present, the top-performing Y6-type NFAs show EQEEL values on the order of 10−3.15 By contrast, the commonly used donor PBDB-TF shows low luminescent properties. Therefore, it is urgent to develop high luminescent donors and study their effects on the Vlosss of OPV cells.
Herein, we designed a series of carboxylate-functionalized thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT)-based polymers named PBTT-Cn (n = 3, 4, 5), which differ in the length of the alkyl chains. These polymers exhibited varied luminescent properties. Both PBTT-C4 and C5 showed a noticeably high EQEEL in the order of 10−2, which is among the highest values for polymer donors. By contrast, PBTT-C3 showed a much lower EQEEL by over three orders of magnitude. Along with the low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of PBTT-C4, the resulting OPV cell fabricated by blending BTP-eC9 showed a high VOC of 0.89 V and a satisfactory PCE of 15.0%. The excellent EQEEL of 6 × 10−4 was measured and the corresponding Vnon-radloss was 0.19 V. Other NFAs were used to fabricate the devices. It is noteworthy that via blending with BTA3, the C4-based device exhibited an impressive EQEEL of over 10−2, which is even higher than that for silicon solar cells and approaches perovskite devices.6,16 Overall, the novel polymer PBTT-C4 is a potential donor to further reduce Vnon-radloss of OPV cells, which also demonstrated that the design of a high luminescent polymer donor is likely to be a feasible way to enhance the luminescent intensity of OPV cells.
The synthesis of PBTT-Cn (n = 3,4,5) is outlined in Scheme S1 (ESI†). Detailed synthesis procedures can be found in the ESI,† (Fig. S1–S6). The PBTT-Cn polymers can be dissolved in common solvents, such as chloroform (CF), o-xylene (o-XY), and chlorobenzene (CB). The thermogravimetric analysis shows that these polymers have good thermal stability for a wide range of temperatures (Fig. S7, ESI†).
Quantum calculations were performed to understand the optimized geometry of the polymer backbone.17,18 As shown in Fig. 1a, the dihedral angle between the benzodithiophene (BDT) and TT moieties is approximately 30°. Fig. 1b displays the electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution of the polymer on the van der Waals surface. Most conjugated parts show negative ESP values, indicating its electron-donating feature. To simulate the impact of the solvent on the torsion of the backbone, we carried out the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, where 12000 o-XY molecules and 2 PBTT-C4 molecular models with eight repeat units were employed.17 As displayed in Fig. 1c and d, the polymers show a planar conformation and the statistical torsion angle distributes around 180° with a small variation, suggesting that the solvent molecules can help to reduce the above torsion angle. The calculated HOMOs and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). From the cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S8, ESI†), three polymers show marginal differences in HOMO/LUMO levels. The polymers show low-lying HOMO levels, which are almost aligned with BTP-eC9. The small energy offset between the donor and acceptor (ΔHOMO) has been suggested as one of the prerequisites to get low Vlosss.

The temperature-dependent (TD) UV-Vis absorption spectra of polymers in o-XY solution are shown in Fig. 2a–c. At 120 °C, the polymers show different absorption features. Specifically, for PBTT-C3, there are two peaks at 573 and 603 nm. For polymer PBTT-C4, the absorption peaks have slight blue shifts. For PBTT-C5, the shoulder peak at the long-wavelength almost disappears and the other peak blue shifts to 505 nm. With a decrease in temperature, the absorption intensity of the shoulder peak becomes stronger, accompanied by redshifts of both peaks. These observations indicate that the polymers have pre-aggregation properties.19 The TD UV-Vis absorption spectra of the polymers in other solvents were shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). From solution to thin-film states (Fig. 2d), the polymers show red-shifted absorption due to the enhanced intermolecular stacking. The absorption spectra of the polymer films range from 400 to 650 nm, which are complementary to that of BTP-eC9. As three polymers possess the same conjugated backbone, their absorption onsets almost locate at the same position of 660 nm. In comparison, the locations of main absorption peaks in solution display small changes (611, 622, and 626 nm for C5, C4, and C3 polymers, respectively), which suggests different aggregation behaviors in solvents.

We first fabricated the neat polymer-based devices to investigate luminescent abilities. PBTT-C4 and C5 show the impressive EQEEL values of over 1 × 10−2 (Fig. S10, ESI†), which are among the highest values for polymer donors. By contrast, PBTT-C3 displays a weak EQEEL of 8.07 × 10−6. VOCs were then measured. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, PBTT-C4- and C5-based devices show the VOCs higher than 1.4 V, which are the highest VOCS of OPV cells.20 For PBTT-C3, a VOC of 1.28 V was obtained. PBTT-C4 and C5-based devices possess remarkably low Vnon-radloss s of 0.11 V and 0.12 V, respectively, while C3-based device shows a Vnon-radloss of 0.30 V. The difference in Vnon-radloss s is consistent with the VOCs of these devices.

To explore the photovoltaic performance of three polymers, OPV devices were fabricated by blending BTP-eC9 as the electron acceptor. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3b and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PBTT-C4-based device possessed an outstanding VOC of 0.892 V, which is one of the highest VOCs in Y6 derivate-based systems.9,15 The short-circuit current density (JSC) reaches 23.4 mA cm−2 and the fill factor (FF) is 71.8%, which can be partly ascribed to its high and balanced mobilities (Table S1 and Fig. S11, S12, ESI†). As a result, a good PCE of over 15% was obtained. The other two devices outputted lower PCEs due to decreased JSCs and FFs. The VOC of PBTT-C3-based device was only 0.657 V, which is lower by 0.230 V than C5-based device. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for these devices are shown in Fig. 3c. It can be seen that the PBTT-C4-based device shows a much higher photoresponse than the other devices from 300 to 900 nm.

The exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdisss) were then measured (Fig. 3d). With the increase of the effective voltage (Veff), the photocurrent density (Jph) approaches the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat). The Jsat of the PBTT-C4-based device is 25.1 mA cm−2 and the corresponding Pdiss (the ratio of JSC/Jsat) is 93.4%. For the PBTT-C3- and C5-based devices, much lower Pdisss indicate less efficient charge transfer and collection. The JSC and VOC values at different light intensities (Plights) were measured (Fig. 3e). The relationship between JSC and Plight is given by JSC ∝ PSlight. PBTT-C4- and C5-based systems show weak bimolecular recombination, where the s values close to 1 were obtained, while an s value of 0.85 demonstrates that severe bimolecular recombination occurred in the C3-based device. The Plight dependence of VOC is given by VOC ∝ nkBT/q ln (Plight), whose slope can be used to evaluate the degree of trap-assisted recombination. The lowest slope of the PBTT-C4-based device implies suppressed trap-assisted recombination.
To investigate the origin of high voltages in these devices, we analyzed the voltage loss in detail, which can be divided into two parts: the voltage loss due to charge generation (ΔVCT = Eg/e − ECT/e) and charge recombination (ECT/e − VOC).4,7 The CT state can be extracted from the fitted reduced EQE and the EL spectra (Fig. S13, ESI†).21 All devices possessed small ΔVCT due to high CT states. The other loss can be divided into radiative loss and Vnon-radloss. The EQEEL was then measured to compare Vnon-radloss s (Fig. 3f). The PBTT-C4-based device gave an impressive EQEEL of 6 × 10−4. Thus the Vnon-radloss of the PBTT-C4-based device was around 0.19 V (Table S2, ESI†), which is among the lowest Vnon-radloss s of highly efficient OPV cells.9,15,18
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) were performed to investigate film morphology (Fig. 4 and Fig. S14, S15, ESI†). From the AFM images, we can find pronounced nanofibers in the three blend films, which is similar with the pristine films. The PBTT-C3-based film shows the largest mean-square surface roughness (Rq) of 6.59 nm. By contrast, the Rq values are 4.68 and 3.88 nm for PBTT-C4- and C5-based blend films, respectively. It was found that three films showed a face-on orientation. The thickness of PBTT-C4- and C5-based films are 100 nm while PBTT-C3-based film is around 70 nm, which might result in the weakest GIWAXS signal of PBTT-C3-based film. As mentioned above, the difference of main absorption peaks of polymer films mainly resulted from different aggregation effects. The GIWAXS results have also proved this point. The π–π distances of PBTT-C3-, C4- and C5-based blends were 3.55, 3.74, and 3.76 Å, respectively, which is correlated with their aggregation behaviors.

To further investigate the potential applications of PBTT-C4, other NFAs were also selected to construct devices. All the devices showed decent PCEs, high VOCs, and excellent EQEEL (Fig. S16, S17, and Table S3, ESI†). Most impressively, by blending a wide bandgap NFA BTA3, an ultra-high EQEEL of over 1 × 10−2 was obtained, which is the highest EQEEL value of reported OPV cells.18 The Vnon-radloss was only 0.11 eV, which is even lower than the values for silicon and common perovskite solar cells.6
To summarize, we synthesized three COTT-based polymers PBTT-Cn with different alkyl chains. Due to the varied aggregation properties, the luminescent property of the three polymers changed drastically. By blending PBTT-C4 with BTP-eC9, the OPV device outputs a high VOC of 0.89 V and a PCE of 15%. The EQEEL is 6 × 10−4 and the Vnon-radloss is 0.19 V, which is among the best values for highly efficient systems. Via using BTA3, devices can record a VOC of 1.32 V with an ultra-high EQEEL of 1 × 10−2. These results imply that employing a high luminescent wide-bandgap donor might be useful for decreasing Vnon-radloss and further improving the efficiencies of OPV cells. There is still a long way to rationally design high luminescence OPV materials with excellent photovoltaic performance, where both the electronic effect of the single-molecule and the aggregation behaviors should be considered. Introducing functional groups with high luminescence properties into the conjugated backbone may be a feasible method. Furthermore, the aggregation effects should be finely tuned to get a balance on the charge transport and suppressed quenching.
