    , Accepted 2nd November 2022First published on 3rd November 2022AbstractInfrared light accounts for the vast majority of natural light energy, however, the challenge of converting infrared light directly into electricity is too difficult. The photothermoelectric (PTE) effect (connecting the photothermal (PT) and thermoelectric (TE) effects) provides a feasible solution for the indirect conversion of infrared light into electrical energy. Therefore, it is of great significance to actively seek and explore materials with good PT and TE performance to fully harvest infrared light energy. Here, we prepared an organic–inorganic hybrid bulk heterojunction film by combining poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):polystyrenesulphonate (PEDOT:PSS) and ZnO nanowires (ZnO-NWs). This common composite strategy is able to utilize the ultra-wide spectrum ranging from ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) to near-infrared (NIR) light to realize light-to-electricity conversion based on the PTE effect. ZnO-NWs can not only increase the Seebeck coefficient of PEDOT:PSS, but also enhance the absorption of the hybrid film under the NIR light. Thereby, the enhancement of the photothermal-induced voltage was achieved due to the separation of generated electron–hole pairs in the built-in electric field induced by a photothermal gradient. This study provides a new suggestion for improving the PTE performance of the material and making better use of solar energy.
1 Introduction
With the rapid economic growth, the energy crisis and environmental problems have attracted increasing attention around the world due to the excessive consumption of non-renewable fossil energy.1–3 Therefore, the development of clean and renewable energy is crucial to the sustainable development of the human society. Solar light is one of the most promising renewable energy, but it is still a big challenge for the valid conversion of solar energy into electrical power in the near-infrared region. In recent years, a rapid development is witnessed on the energy conversion technology from sunshine to electricity. A direct conversion based on the photothermoelectric (PTE) effect is attracting widespread attention, in which an electrical signal is generated in response to the photothermal (PT) and thermoelectric (TE) effects caused by incident light irradiation.4–6 As an electrical power generators, the poor PT and TE properties seriously hinder their development in harvesting solar energy. Therefore, it is desired to design a high-performance material with wide light absorption and a large PT conversion efficiency to harvest solar energy and convert it into electrical power.
Organic materials have attracted extensive attention in the PT, optoelectronic and TE fields due to their abundant resources and structures.7–10 In particular, conjugated polymers have shown high PT conversion efficiency (>40%) and low thermal conductivity.11 Among them, poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):polystyrenesulphonate (PEDOT:PSS) has become one of the most popular conducting polymers owing to its commercial availability, solution processing capability and high flexibility.12,13 Currently, numerous investigations focus on the TE performance based on PEDOT:PSS films. However, the as-prepared PEDOT:PSS film directly obtained from a PEDOT:PSS solution exhibits poor electrical conductivity, because the excess amount of insulating PSS components encapsulating the conductive PEDOT cores and the coil conformation of the PEDOT chain inhibit the efficient carrier transport. Therefore, many efforts, such as solvent post-treatment, redox state controlling, constructing exquisite multi-architectures and introducing auxiliary components, have been made to enhance the TE performance of PEDOT:PSS.14–19 The outstanding performance of PEDOT:PSS meets the requirements for high-performance PTE composite manufacturing and a flexible device design. However, PEDOT:PSS cannot be directly used for PTE conversion on account of its poor light absorption performance in the ultraviolet (UV) region and low Seebeck coefficient (14–18 μV/K). Therefore, an effective strategy needs to be proposed to further solve the current problem.
Organic–inorganic composites have been proven to be a very effective strategy for tuning the optical, thermal, and electrical properties of conducting polymers.6,9,20 Among inorganic materials, ZnO has been widely used for its large free exciton binding energy (60 meV), wide band gap (3.2–3.37 eV), stability for high temperature operation, and excellent photoresponsivity in the UV region.21–23,34 And it also plays an important role in optoelectronic and TE composites24,25 combining with p-type materials to construct p–n hybrid bulk heterojunctions, thereby improving the performance of conductive polymer materials, such as improving the photoelectric conversion efficiency, enhancing the sensitivity of the UV sensor and the photocatalytic performance.25–28 Kim et al.24 reported that the hybrid composites of PEDOT:PSS and ZnO particles enhanced the performance of organic TE devices due to the improved electrical conductivity by the bridging role of ZnO particles. Zhang et al.25 reported that the output performance of P3HT/ZnO nanowire array photovoltaic cells was greatly improved under weak light illumination due to the construction of heterojunctions. Therefore, the composite of polymers and inorganic materials will generate some new synergistic or complementary behaviors, which are beneficial for the overall improvement of performance.
In this work, we hope to combine the high electrical conductivity, good film formation and flexibility of PEDOT:PSS and the UV-sensitive properties of ZnO-NWs to construct a PEDOT:PSS/ZnO-NWs hybrid flexible film, thereby improving the PTE of the PEDOT:PSS films. Based on the p– and n-type organic–inorganic hybrid heterojunctions, the photo-generated electron–hole pairs in the material are enhanced under light irradiation, and the temperature difference is utilized to promote the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes. At the same time, the filtration of low-energy carriers is promoted, thereby achieving a higher solar harvesting efficiency. This work aims to provide a feasible solution for improving the PTE properties of materials and increasing the harvesting efficiency of solar energy.
2 Results and discussion
ZnO-NWs used in this work were synthesized via a sample vapor trapping CVD method following a previous report as shown in the ESI.†Fig. 1A displays the morphology of the as-synthesized ZnO-NWs, one can see that the as-prepared product consists of a great quantity of wire-like nanostructures with typical lengths in the range of several tens to several hundreds of micrometers. Although uniform ZnO-NW films can be prepared by solution dispersion and suction filtration, the resultant films are not free-standing and have poor electrical conductivities. In contrast, the PEDOT:PSS film shows a uniform and dense morphology as shown in Fig. S1A.† Consequently, a free-standing PEDOT:PSS/ZnO-NWs hybrid film shows the uniform surface (Fig. S1B†) when ZnO-NWs is less than 40 wt%. Fig. 1B presents the XRD spectra of ZnO-NWs and PEDOT:PSS/ZnO-NWs hybrid films. The diffraction signals at 2θ = 31.6°, 34.2°, 36.2°, 47.4°, 56.5°, 62.8°, and 67.9°, correspond to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), and (112) planes of ZnO-NWs (JCPDS, 76-0704) including a hexagonal wurtzite crystalline phase.29,30 For the PEDOT:PSS/ZnO-NWs hybrid, additional diffraction peaks between17.7° and 25.6° can be indexed to PEDOT:PSS compared to ZnO-NWs, revealing the successful formation of the PEDOT:PSS/ZnO-NWs composite.31 Taking into account the PTE effect, it is very desirable for the as-synthesized materials with a wide absorption in the visible light range. Fig. 1C shows the optical absorption spectrum of the as-grown ZnO-NWs with a strong absorption peak in the UV region and the band energy of ZnO-NWs is about 3.30 eV according to the Tauc plot (Fig. S2†). This result is very close to the optical band gap reported by other researchers.32 PEDOT:PSS exhibits a broad absorption from the visible to near-infrared (NIR) regions, depending on the existence of polaron/bipolaron transitions in the PEDOT backbone.33 Note that the overall integral absorption intensity increase between UV-Vis and NIR for PEDOT:PSS with ZnO-NWs indicates a strong excitonic interaction between ZnO and PEDOT:PSS.34 It demonstrates that the introduction of ZnO-NWs significantly improves the light absorption of PEDOT:PSS. Generally, UV illumination above the bandgap energy easily generates photogenerated electron–hole pairs which are separated inside the ZnO channel (electrons) as well as on the ZnO surface (holes).35 However, the NIR light is obviously different from the UV light. Due to its heat effect, the film can be heated under irradiation and induced voltage can be generated from a temperature gradient originating from the photogenerated heat energy due to the TE performance.36 This may lead to the film having a good photothermal conversion ability under Vis-NIR light, thereby improving the conversion of solar energy to electricity. Additionally, one can find that the hybrid film shows a significantly lower reflectance compared to pure PEDOT:PSS from 200 to 2500 nm (Fig. 1D), indicating the excellent light trapping capability due to the rougher surface of the hybrid film. The AFM phase images of the PEDOT:PSS film (Fig. 1E) show a uniformly flat surface, while the hybrid film exhibited bright and dark areas and an uneven surface (Fig. 1F). The PEDOT:PSS/ZnO-NWs film shows a larger root-mean-square (RMS) of 38 nm in Fig. S3† than that of PEDOT:PSS (5.04 nm). Therefore, the hybrid film possesses low reflectivity and high roughness, which facilitates the ability of optical-to-electrical conversion.

Infrared light accounts for the vast majority of natural light energy, however, the challenge of converting infrared light directly into electricity is difficult. The PTE effect provides a feasible strategy for the indirect conversion of infrared light into electrical energy.6,37 Therefore, good TE performance can effectively convert thermal charging into electrical energy. Hybrid organic–inorganic material has been considered as a new candidate in the field of TE materials over the last decade. Meanwhile, the interaction of organic and inorganic materials at the nano or atomic scale can cause strong perturbation in the structural, electron, and phonon characteristics, providing new mechanisms to tune the electrical and thermal transport properties.38,39 PEDOT:PSS is a p-type semiconductor, and its TE performance is usually improved by combining with p-type inorganic semiconductors to optimize the TE performance such as Te-NWs/PEDOT:PSS and TMDs/PEDOT:PSS, etc.40,41 At present, few studies on the optimization of TE performance of materials based on p–n type composites. Lee et al. reported TE optimization of PEDOT:PSS/ZnO composites based on the size of ZnO particles.24 So, it is highly desirable based on the better PT performance of ZnO/PEDOT:PSS, which can exhibit enhanced TE performance. A pure PEDOT:PSS film shows a high σ of 390 S cm−1 with a small S of 15 μV K−1. In contrast, the introduction of ZnO-NWs enhanced the S of PEDOT:PSS to 23 μV K−1 (Fig. S4†). However, a low TE power factor (PF) eventually results due to the decrease in σ. This result is somewhat inconsistent with those reported in the literature, possibly due to the size effect of ZnO-NWs.35 One can find that the introduction of ZnO-NWs effectively enhances the carrier mobility of the films resulting in the increase of S in the hybrid film, while a reduced carrier concentration results in reduced σ (Fig. S5†). In addition, the interaction between ZnO-NWs and PEDOT:PSS leads to abundant contact interfaces, which provide favorable conditions for low-energy carrier scattering, which plays a positive role in the enhancement of S. Moreover, the formation of this p/n interface may generate additional photoelectric effects, which may contribute to the improvement of TE performance.42
The PTE effect provides a feasible way for the energy harvesting of infrared light. Thence, in order to explore the induced voltage response of the film under different wavelengths, 405, 532, 635, 808, and 1064 nm lasers were used to irradiate the left side of the film. As shown in Fig. 2A, the PEDOT:PSS film irradiated by UV-Vis and IR light showed strong voltage responses. Note that the induced voltage response of the hybrid film is higher after the introduction of ZnO-NWs compared to PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the time-dependent induced voltage exhibits repeatable characteristics. The induced voltage of the hybrid film increased before 700 nm due to the combined effect of the intrinsic absorption of ZnO-NWs and PEDOT:PSS. Note that the induced voltage value at 1064 nm is much higher compared to that of PEDOT:PSS, owing to the strong exciton–exciton interaction between PEDOT:PSS and ZnO-NWs and the existence of polaron/dipolaron transitions in the PEDOT backbone.33,34 This result is consistent with the UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum. At the same time, the power dependences of the induced voltage at five wavelengths for the PEDOT:PSS film and the hybrid film, all exhibit good linear behaviors (Fig. S6†). Fig. 2C and Fig. S7† show the response time of the induced voltage as the five wavelength laser was switched on and off, respectively. Normally the response time of optical-to-electrical conversion takes - few milliseconds depending on the material structure. However, the hybrid film shows a slow photoresponse. This provides strong evidence to support the induced voltage process in this hybrid film, which includes not only direct optical-to-electrical conversion, but also a PTE effect.43 In the PTE case, once a temperature difference is established between the ends of hybrid film, the heat energy is dissipated by convection, conduction, and radiation to achieve thermal equilibrium. The process of achieving thermal equilibrium is time consuming, generally taking longer than 1 s.44 Therefore, optical-to-electrical conversion and the PTE effect in the hybrid film occur simultaneously in this study.

(C) The voltage response velocities of the PEDOT:PSS/ZnO-NWs hybrid film under illumination at 1064 nm. (D) The time-dependent induced voltages of the PEDOT:PSS/ZnO-NWs hybrid film is irradiated by various lasers together. (E) The reflectance and corresponding ΔT under different lasers, and (F) the induced voltages of PTE and TE with different lasers at the same temperature. 

Fig. 2D shows the induced voltages generated by stacking multiple lasers together. Note that different wavelengths of light contribute differently to the PTE of the hybrid film. Among them, in the absence of a 1024 nm laser, the induced voltage it produces drops by around 32.6% compared to the five laser stacks. At the same time, the induced voltage decreased by about 26.5% in the absence of a 405 nm laser. This indicates that the hybrid film is more sensitive to UV and IR light due to the synergistic effect of PEDOT:PSS and ZnO-NWs, which is consistent with the absorption spectrum in Fig. 1C. According to previous reports, it has been shown that the addition of ZnO-NWs greatly enhanced the overall photodetector responsivity and pyroelectric effect under UV light irradiation.21,25,45 Therefore, the introduction of ZnO-NWs is expected to improve the PTE performance of PEDOT:PSS. In addition, it is found that the reflectivity of the hybrid film at different laser wavelengths is relatively low (less than 1.5%) (Fig. 2E), indicating the excellent light trapping capability due to the greater surface roughness of the hybrid film. Compared to the induced voltage generated by PTE and TE at the same temperature (ΔT∼1 K), the hybrid thin films by heating and lighting using different lasers (Fig. 2F), respectively. It can be seen that the induced voltage of the hybrid film obtained under laser irradiation is significantly larger than that under heating. This further proves that the addition of ZnO-NWs is beneficial for improving the PT performance of PEDOT:PSS.
In order to test the actual effect of PTE energy harvesting, a xenon lamp (wavelength: 320–2500 nm) as simulated sunlight was used to illuminate the PEDOT:PSS/ZnO-NWs hybrid film. It can be observed from Fig. 3A that with an increase in the ZnO-NW content, the maximum temperature difference and maximum induced voltage of the hybrid film have been increasing steadily. Note that the induced voltage of the hybrid film with 40 wt% content of ZnO-NWs is increased by 57% compared to the PEDOT:PSS film (Fig. S8†). This indicates that the introduction of ZnO-NWs can significantly improve the photoelectric conversion ability of PEDOT:PSS, which is consistent with the results of the previous analysis. In addition, the radiation area has a significant effect on its induced voltage (Fig. 3B). When the illumination area is 100 mm2, based on the low reflection and excellent light trapping ability, a high temperature difference (ΔT∼34 K) can be generated across the PEDOT:PSS/ZnO-NWs hybrid film, resulting in a higher potential difference (0.66 mV). When the irradiation area is 100 mm2, the PEDOT:PSS film can also generate an induced voltage of 0.42 mV due to the large absorption of PEDOT:PSS (Fig. S9†) in the near-infrared region. In addition, since the introduction of ZnO-NWs enhances the absorption of PEDOT:PSS in the UV-Vis region, the induced voltage generated by the hybrid film is higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS film, which further indicates that UV-Vis light has a significant contribution to the hybrid film. Furthermore, the voltage induced by direct heating does not depend on the size of the area of the heated part of the sample, but only on the inherent electron transport of the material itself. Fig. 3C shows a comparison of the S, voltage, and PF of the as-prepared hybrid film in an illumination area of 100 mm2 under heating and xenon lamp lighting at the same temperature. One can find that the performance induced by light illumination is significantly higher than that of direct heating. This may be due to the excellent photoelectric effect of ZnO-NWs combined with the PT effect of PEDOT:PSS to synergistically enhance the PTE performance under illumination.25,45 Moreover, the formation of this p–n interface may generate additional photoelectric effects, which may contribute to the improvement of the TE performance. Note that PEDOT:PSS film exhibits a higher performance under illumination (Fig. 3D), which is inconsistent with previous reports.46 This may be due to the strong absorption of PEDOT:PSS under near-infrared light, which leads to an induced voltage generated under illumination.

The S, induced voltage, and PF with an illumination area of 100 mm2 were compared under heating and xenon lamp lighting at the same temperature for the as-prepared films of (C) PEDOT:PSS/ZnO-NWs at ΔT∼34 K and (D) PEDOT:PSS film at ΔT∼26 K. 
To further understand the role of organic–inorganic hybrid heterojunctions in enhancing the TE performance, Fig. 4 shows a scheme of the generation and separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs and the energy band of the PEDOT:PSS/ZnO-NWs hybrid bulk heterojunction under light illumination. Generally, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of PEDOT:PSS are estimated to be 3.7 and 5.2 eV, respectively.47,48 The ZnO conduction and valence band levels are 4.5 eV and 7.8 eV.34,42,49 Therefore, the contact of PEDOT:PSS and ZnO will form a typical heterojunction with the band offset in the valence band (Ev) at 2.6 eV and in the conduction band (Ec) at 0.8 eV. To keep the equilibrium of the heterojunction Fermi level, the energy bands of PEDOT:PSS move up and bend downwards at the interface, while the energy bands of ZnO-NWs move down and bend upwards at the interface.48 This creates a charge depletion layer at the interface, and a built-in potential formed inside the depletion layer. Upon excitation by UV-Vis light (Fig. 4A), the photoinduced electron–hole pairs are created in the heterojunction of the hybrid film due to the intrinsic absorption of UV light by ZnO-NWs, - then charge separation occurs at the built-in electric field (Fig. 4B). The NIR light is obviously different from the UV-Vis-light due to its long wavelength and low energy. Due to the heat effect, the hybrid thin film can be heated under NIR light irradiation. Therefore, a lot of electron–hole pairs are generated in the depletion layer by absorbing photons and then quickly separated, as shown in Fig. 4C. The width of the depletion layer decreases due to the migration of the photo-induced charge carriers under the drive of the built-in electric field with light illumination. The thinner depletion layer makes it easy for the charge carrier transport, leading to a sharp increase in the photo-induced voltage.48,50 However, for the hybrid film, if only the heating plate is used for heating instead of illumination, the electron–hole pairs of the ZnO-NW itself may not be excited, lacking partial photoelectric conversion, and only pure heat drives the movement of internal carriers. This results in a lower voltage of the hybrid film under direct heating than the induced voltage under UV-Vis-NIR irradiation. This indicates that the introduction of ZnO-NWs can promote the synergistic photoelectric and PT effects to enhance the induced voltage or S of the hybrid films.

(D) The molecular structure of PEDOT:PSS before and after dilution with ethanol, and (E) a schematic diagram of the energy filtering effect. 
It is worth noting that the polymer conformation of PEDOT:PSS plays a key role in the transport of charge (Fig. 4D). Ethanol dilution enables PEDOT:PSS to significantly change its conformation from disordered to a PEDOT-rich nanocrystal and facilitates the charge transport property without the degradation of S.14,15 Moreover, the enhanced S is mainly ascribed to the energy filtering effect (Fig. 4E) at the interface between PEDOT:PSS and ZnO-NWs. Low-energy carriers are scattered by the potential barrier at the interface between two phases, whereas high-energy carriers cross the barrier. When two materials with different energy band structures are in contact, the energy filtering effect is easy to appear at the interface, which reduces the transport of low-energy carriers, thereby increasing the S.51 Note that the energy filtering effect reported in many previous works mainly focuses on the composite of PEDOT:PSS with p-type inorganic materials, and the composite with n-type inorganic materials is rarely reported. One can find from Fig. S4† that when the ZnO content reaches 40%, the S is relatively maximum and the conductivity is minimum, which is probably due to the energy filtering effect. Similarly, under the PTE effect, because UV-Vis light can generate a large number of electron–hole pairs, it is not excluded that the carriers with high energy can smoothly pass through the interface and contribute to the S.

Fig. 5A shows the I–V characteristic curves of the hybrid film avoiding light (black line) and with light illumination at the positive (blue line) and negative (red line) ends in the air at room temperature. It can be seen that the I–V curves exhibit linear behavior over the measured range from −1.8 to 1.8 mV, which indicates good ohmic behavior between the film and electrodes. Note that the red line exhibits a clear upward shift with respect to the black I–V curve when the film ends were exposed to the light illumination, which is typical PTE signature, and similar phenomena can be observed for other PTE materials.52 Furthermore, to further demonstrate the contribution of UV light to the hybrid films, the hybrid films were irradiated with different lasers, as shown in Fig. 5B. It is clearly revealed that the photoconductance is sensitive to the excitation wavelength. The photoconductance of the hybrid film at 405 nm is larger than that of PEDOT:PSS (Fig. S10†), which indicates high sensitivity to UV light. As power materials for wearable electronic devices, the film should provide the required excellent output stability and flexibility. Measurements were carried out to study the stability and reliability of the film, as shown in Fig. 5C. The inset of Fig. 5C shows the bending illustration of a hybrid film with a radius of curvature of 1 cm. After bending 120 times, the temperature difference and induced voltage of the prepared hybrid films remained highly stable, and the introduction of ZnO-NWs does not affect the flexibility and mechanical properties of the hybrid film. Fig. 5D displays the generated ΔT and induced voltage for the hybrid thin film within 9 light on–off cycles. Both the ΔT and induced voltage repeated well, verifying the stable PTE performance during light illumination. The PEDOT:PSS film also exhibited excellent output stability and flexibility, as can be seen from Fig. S11.†

3 Conclusion
In summary, this work constructed a p–n type organic–inorganic hybrid bulk heterojunction film based on PEDOT:PSS and ZnO-NWs. The prepared hybrid film showed a wide spectral absorption in the UV-Vis to NIR region to meet the requirements for utilizing solar energy. Meanwhile, the introduction of ZnO-NWs not only effectively reduces the light reflection of PEDOT:PSS, but also improves the S of PEDOT:PSS. The S of the hybrid film under the PTE effect is higher than that under the TE effect due to the synergistic photoelectric and PT effects. In addition, the contribution of light of different wavelengths to the PTE effect is different. Finally, the improved performance of the hybrid film is mainly due to the heterojunction and energy filtering effects. This work aims to provide a feasible strategy for improving the PTE properties of materials and increasing the solar harvesting efficiency.
