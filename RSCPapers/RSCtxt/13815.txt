    , Accepted 25th June 2017First published on 30th June 2017AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites already reach very high power conversion efficiencies above 22% on architectures employing mesoporous TiO2, but the carrier injection processes across the different interfaces are still not fully understood. Here we use ultrafast broadband transient absorption spectroscopy to determine time constants and yields for hole and electron injection. We show that hole transfer from the perovskite valence band (VB) to the hole-transport material (HTM) H101 at the perovskite/HTM interface occurs in less than 500 fs, but is limited by imperfections of the contact layer and poor infiltration of the HTM into the mesoporous structure. Electron injection from the perovskite conduction band (CB) into the CB of mesoporous TiO2 is only a small channel (25%). Electron transport inside mesoporous MAPI/TiO2 architectures therefore mainly occurs via the perovskite. We also show that electron injection from H101 into the perovskite is feasible for excitation at 400 nm resulting in light-harvesting of high-energy photons by the HTM. Accurate absolute NIR absorption coefficients for CB electrons in mesoporous TiO2 are provided.
1. Introduction
Lead-based halide perovskite materials derived from methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPI) have reached very high photovoltaic power conversion efficiencies1 with a currently certified top value of 22.1% for a small-area device.2 Several properties contribute to the excellent performance of these compounds such as their high optical absorption coefficient enabling the use of very thin absorber layers for charge separation and collection,3 a low exciton binding energy leading to efficient formation of separated electrons and holes,4,5 a sufficiently high carrier mobility,6 long carrier lifetimes linked e.g. to a spin-split indirect gap,7–11 large diffusion lengths in the micrometre range for efficient carrier collection,3,12 as well as a high defect tolerance due to the presence of only shallow defect states.13
While the intrinsic properties of the lead-halide perovskites are now reasonably well characterised, the interfacial charge transfer processes at the electron- and hole-selective contacts are still far from being understood. This is particularly the case for the currently best-performing devices employing mesoporous TiO2 and molecular organic hole-transport materials (HTMs) typically featuring triarylamine units, such as spiro-OMeTAD.14,15 Important questions regarding the carrier dynamics in such systems are e.g.: how much does the perovskite and how much does the mesoporous TiO2 layer contribute to the electron transport?16 How fast is the initial hole injection step at the interface, and why do different HTMs show different hole injection efficiencies, as e.g. evidenced by vastly different photoluminescence (PL) quenching behaviour?17–19 Here we will address some of these questions for the prototypical MAPI perovskite on mesoporous TiO2 using H101 as the HTM (Fig. 1).20 H101 consists of a 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene bearing two triphenylamine units in the 2- and 5-positions. It is therefore a good representative of the widely used triarylamine-containing HTMs. Specifically, H101 has shown good performance in perovskite solar cells, reaching about 14% efficiency.20,21

We investigated the time scales and yields of hole injection from the VB of MAPI to H101 and of electron injection from the CB of MAPI into the CB of mesoporous TiO2 using broadband pump–supercontinuum probe (PSCP) Vis-NIR transient absorption spectroscopy. Fig. 2 shows the schematic energy level diagram of the system of interest based on available literature data20,22 including the possible charge carrier injection processes which will be analysed below. In addition, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was employed in the present study as an inert reference film instead of H101 on top of the perovskite layer.

2. Experimental
2.1 Sample preparation
Microscope glass slides were cleaned with an aqueous detergent solution and acetone and then thoroughly dried. Commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol DSL 90T) was diluted with 2-propanol (Fisher Scientific, p.a., 99.97%) and deposited by doctor-blading. After sintering at 450 °C, an approx. 350 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 layer was obtained. Slides were cut into pieces with a size of 2.5 × 2.5 cm2.
Preparation and handling of the perovskite samples were carried out in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere (relative humidity <2%). For preparation of the perovskite sample, PbI2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) and a slight excess of methylammonium iodide (MAI, Dyenamo) were dissolved under stirring in N,N-dimethylformamide (Acros Organics, 99.8%, Extra Dry) to obtain an approx. 14 wt% precursor solution with a mole fraction of xMAI ≈ 54%. Note that such a small MAI excess has no influence on the optoelectronic properties of the perovskite, as described in detail in one of our previous publications.10 The lower weight percentage of the perovskite compared with typical device conditions (>30 wt%) is required to avoid total absorption in the transmission measurement. The precursor solution was then spin-coated onto the mesoporous TiO2 films for 4 s at 500 rpm and 30 s at 2000 rpm and annealed on a hotplate for 45 min at 80 °C.
The additional layer of the hole-transport material H101 (Dyesol) was deposited on the sample by spin-coating 100 μL of a 15 mM solution in chlorobenzene (Fisher Scientific, p.a., 99.8%) for 4 s at 500 rpm and 30 s at 2000 rpm after 28 s loading time. The sample was dried for 15 min at 80 °C on a hotplate providing a homogeneous area of approx. 1 cm diameter around the center of the sample (see Fig. S1, ESI†). This region was scanned during the transient absorption experiments. A layer of PMMA (Alfa Aesar, average MW 120000) was prepared in the same way by spin-coating a solution of the substance in chlorobenzene (12.5 mg mL−1) on top of the perovskite and subsequent drying. Reference thin films without MAPI were prepared by spinning the H101/chlorobenzene solution directly onto mesoporous TiO2 and Al2O3 thin films.23
2.2 Pump–supercontinuum probe (PSCP) spectroscopy
Femtosecond pump–probe broadband transient absorption spectra were collected at 920 Hz repetition frequency using two PSCP setups covering the Vis-NIR region (500–1600 nm).10,11,24–30 A detailed description can be found in our previous publication.31 Pump pulses at 505 or 400 nm were chopped at 460 Hz. Pump and probe beams were polarised at magic angle (54.7°). The cross-correlation was typically ca. 80 fs, and the determination of zero time delay was accurate within ca. 20 fs. The pulses were focused into a home-built contact cell32 holding the perovskite thin film. Nitrogen (Messer, 4.6) was constantly passed through the cell during the measurements. It was mounted on an x/y piezo stage and constantly translated within a 2 × 2 mm2 plane perpendicular to the propagation axis of the probe beam. Single-shot baseline corrections were applied. Transient spectra at a certain delay time represent averages of three scans with 1000 pump–probe cycles.
2.3 Spectroelectrochemistry
Details of our spectroelectrochemistry setup were described in our previous studies.26,27,32 H101 cation spectra were obtained in nitrogen-purged acetonitrile using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate as supporting electrolyte in an optically transparent thin-layer electrochemical (OTTLE) cell.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterisation of thin films
XRD patterns of MAPI–TiO2, H101–MAPI–TiO2 and PMMA–MAPI–TiO2 thin films are shown in Fig. 3. The Bragg reflexes for all the three films are virtually identical. This suggests that the 350 nm thick MAPI–TiO2 thin film is not structurally modified by adding the organic H101 and PMMA layers. This is also confirmed by the steady-state absorption spectra in Fig. 4: samples with and without PMMA (panel (b), green and black solid lines) are very similar, except for the consistently smaller absorbance of the PMMA-coated sample. The decrease is due to a reduction in reflectance arising from the replacement of the N2–MAPI interface by the two interfaces N2–PMMA and PMMA–MAPI. A detailed description is provided in the ESI† (Fig. S3). Adding H101 also leads to decreased reflectance (red and black solid lines in panel (a)), as in the case of the PMMA coating. This reduction masks the increased absorption around 400 nm which is assigned to the S0 → S1 transition of H101.

3.2 Overview of transient absorption spectra
Contour plots of the NIR PSCP transient absorption spectra of different thin films are shown in Fig. 5. The quickly decaying transient absorption at 1500 nm for MAPI–TiO2 in the left panel of Fig. 5(c) is due to cooling of hot TiO2 CB electrons injected from the perovskite after its excitation at 505 nm and will be analysed in more detail in Section 3.5. Such an absorption decay is in agreement with previous studies of CB electrons in mesoporous TiO2 thin films performed by Lian and co-workers and our group.33,34 After 1.1 ns the electron signal stays constant suggesting that cooling has finished and that no electron injection occurs on this time scale. We note that trapped holes and trapped electrons in mp-TiO2 absorb below 1100 nm as shown by Yoshihara and co-workers,35 so the signal around 1500 nm can be unequivocally assigned to free electrons in the CB of mp-TiO2. We also note that the results for the reference sample PMMA–MAPI–TiO2 (right panel of Fig. 5(d)) look very similar to those for MAPI–TiO2, so the “insulating” PMMA does not affect the carrier dynamics.

The addition of an H101 layer results in a persistent absorption around 1500 nm. It is assigned to the HTM radical cation H101˙+ (Fig. 5(c), right panel), and this was confirmed by three independent experiments: (i) the spectral position of the radical cation band in the NIR is in agreement with the results from spectroelectrochemistry (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†). (ii) Additional experiments were conducted for MAPI-free samples: for H101–Al2O3 excited at 400 nm (Fig. 5(b)), no electron injection is possible because of the large band gap of Al2O3. We still observe a spectral signature of H101˙+ which we assign to the formation of a radical cation–radical anion pair H101˙+–H101˙− by exciton-splitting. (iii) In the case of H101–TiO2 electron injection from H101 into TiO2 is energetically feasible (Fig. 2) and results in the pronounced H101˙+ absorption seen in Fig. 5(a).
Subtracting the kinetics of the MAPI–TiO2 sample from that of the H101–TiO2–MAPI sample provides the pure response of H101, shown as the cyan line in Fig. 6. Note that no scaling is involved in this procedure: the same perovskite sample (only with or without HTM) was employed in the experiments of Fig. 5(c), and identical initial carrier densities were generated by the pump beam. The transient shows that there is a formation of HTM radical cations in less than 500 fs which is due to hole injection from MAPI into H101. The signal stays constant afterwards showing that no further hole injection occurs on time scales up to 1.5 ns. This of course does not rule out the presence of slower hole injection processes occurring in the several nanosecond regime and beyond. The fast hole transfer is also consistent with the strong quenching of the perovskite PL band at 760 nm, see the red and black spectra (dashed solid lines) in Fig. 4(a).

We also notice characteristic changes of the transient absorption spectra around 760 nm: an absorption increase on the short-wavelength-side and an absorption decrease on the long-wavelength-side of the perovskite bleach band (red and black lines in Fig. 7(a)). There are at least two explanations for this effect: the spectral changes could be assigned to a transient blue-shift of the perovskite absorption band induced by the electric field generated across the film by the electrons in the TiO2 CB and the holes in H101. Such an effect should be absent for the PMMA–MAPI–TiO2 sample, and this is indeed observed in the corresponding reference spectra (green and black lines in Fig. 7(b)): no field across the film can be generated in that case. As an alternative explanation, the hole injection might induce a transient change in reflectance36 at the perovskite–H101 interface which is different from the reflectance change in the absence of H101.

3.3 Quantification of hole injection at the MAPI/H101 interface
In the following we focus on a quantitative analysis of the NIR absorption features of the H101˙+ radical cations. In this spectral region, there is no overlap of strong perovskite bleach and absorption features, in contrast to the Vis region (Fig. 7). We can therefore arrive at reliable estimates for the efficiency of hole injection at the MAPI/H101 interface. The steep rise of the H101˙+ radical cation signal in the PSCP kinetics of Fig. 6 (cyan line) indeed suggests that there is a fast hole injection channel. This must be related to the interface regions where the perovskite is in direct contact with the HTM, so that facile hole transfer is possible because of the large driving force for this process (Fig. 2). This picture is consistent with our previous results for hole transfer processes involving triphenylamine acceptor units which also occurred on ultrafast time scales.37 A quantitative analysis of our present data is given in the following: using the known molar mass of H101 (M = 748.2607 g mol−1)20 and assuming the same density of H101 and spiro-OMeTAD films (ρ = 1.02 g cm−3),38 the concentration of H101 in the HTM film is c(H101) = 1.363 M. The peak absorption coefficient of the radical cation H101˙+ at 1470 nm was determined as ε(H101˙+) = 31280 M−1 cm−1 using spectroelectrochemistry. The measured change in the NIR PSCP spectra at 1500 nm was ΔOD = 2.25 × 10−4 (Fig. 5(c), corrected for the underlying absorption of the electrons injected into the CB of mesoporous TiO2). Then, a simple Lambert–Beer-type calculation using d(H101) = ΔOD/[ε(H101˙+)·c(H101)] provides an absorption length of d(H101) = 53 pm. This value is of course unrealistic, because it assumes that (i) all H101 would be converted into radical cations and (ii) the resulting absorption length is smaller than the diameter of a single H101 molecule. It is physically reasonable to consider oxidation in the sub-nanosecond time regime only in the first H101 layer, which is in direct contact with MAPI, because hole-hopping between the HTM molecules is known to occur on much longer time scales39–41 beyond the two nanosecond time window covered in the PSCP experiments. Using a typical value for the thickness of a monolayer of H101 molecules on the perovskite film based on the H101 molecular structure (long molecular axis l ≈ 2.7 nm) we conclude that the observed change in optical density is consistent with the fact that only one in (2.7 nm/53 pm) ≈ 50 H101 molecules in the first monolayer needs to be oxidised to account for the observed radical cation absorption signal, i.e. a small number.
On the other hand, the quenching of the steady-state PL by H101 (see e.g. the dashed red solid line in Fig. 4(a) and the values in Table S1, ESI†) amounts “only” to 76.3% which at first sight appears to be at variance with the extremely efficient hole injection process at the MAPI/H101 interface found above. Therefore we conclude that the important limitation for the hole transfer is the non-ideal “physical contact” between MAPI and H101, e.g. due to voids remaining from imperfect penetration of the HTM into the mesoporous TiO2/perovskite structure. Holes generated deeper inside a perovskite domain will be able to find an interface for injection at some point, however this will probably require much longer time scales than the 2 ns covered in the current PSCP experiments. Therefore, for this subpopulation of holes the injection into the HTM will be considerably slowed down. As a result, radiative electron–hole recombination in the perovskite competes more efficiently, giving rise to residual PL. Laser experiments on longer time scales to quantify such slower contributions to HTM radical cation formation are currently underway.
Such incomplete PL quenching has been noticed previously, and the degree of quenching was found to depend on the type of HTM used.17–19 The effect is particularly pronounced for polymeric HTMs, such as PTAA, which exhibit poor PL quenching properties on mesoporous architectures.17 For polymer systems it is likely much more difficult to efficiently infiltrate the pores of the mesoporous architecture than for small-molecule HTMs.21,42,43 Future engineering efforts should therefore target the perovskite/HTM interface region to optimise the contact area and infiltration behaviour of the HTM.
3.4 Electron injection yield from MAPI into mesoporous TiO2
In the following we address the question if electron transport mainly occurs inside the perovskite or in the mesoporous TiO2. Absolute absorption coefficients for TiO2 CB electrons in the NIR are required to obtain quantitative results from our transient absorption data. While previous pump–probe experiments in the NIR identified transient absorption of CB electrons in TiO2,35,44,45 no absolute values for the absorption coefficient for this range have been provided so far. Different estimates exist for shorter wavelengths, e.g. ε = 900 M−1 cm−1 (700 nm),46 800 M−1 cm−1 (780 nm),47 and 600 M−1 cm−1 (850 nm).45 Therefore we employed a new method to directly determine the absorption coefficient of TiO2 CB electrons in the NIR: very recently, we studied the donor–acceptor solar cell dye E6 featuring two peripheral triarylamine (pTAA) hole acceptors to characterize photoinduced electron injection from this dye into a mesoporous TiO2 thin film.37 E6 has the convenient property that the hole remaining on the dye after electron injection is quickly transferred to one of the pTAA units. A typical transient spectrum is found in Fig. 8. It shows a characteristic absorption band with a peak at 760 nm which sharply decays toward longer wavelengths. It is assigned to the radical cation pTAA˙+ with the known absolute peak absorption coefficient of 34000 M−1 cm−1.48 Because the radical cation only absorbs at wavelengths below 900 nm, there is no spectral overlap with the intraband absorption of the cooled (300 K) TiO2 CB electrons in the NIR region which is clearly visible in our spectrum above 900 nm. Katoh and co-workers previously established that the NIR absorption coefficient of free TiO2 CB electrons increases with λ1.7.35 This power dependence is shown as a dashed red line in Fig. 8 and describes the rise of our transient NIR spectrum well. Our data provides the simple expression ε = 0.027·λ1.7, where ε is in M−1 cm−1 and λ in nm. Because electron injection generates electrons and dye radical cations in a 1:1 ratio and all cations are present as pTAA˙+, the absorption coefficient of the TiO2 CB electrons can be also accurately determined. We obtain a value of 6770 M−1 cm−1 at 1500 nm. In addition, we assume a typical value of 62% for the porosity of the mesoporous TiO2 layer.38 Then, an estimate based on the Lambert–Beer law using ΔOD = 2.28 × 10−4 (Fig. 5(c), left panel) and the known TiO2 layer thickness d(TiO2) = 350 nm provides the number density of TiO2 CB electrons Ne,TiO2 = 1.5 × 1018 cm−3 injected from the perovskite. In addition, we independently determined the initial electron and hole density in the perovskite N0 = Ne = Nh = 6.2 × 1018 cm−3 using the known optical density of the perovskite layer and the known pump beam fluence at 505 nm measured using a calibrated photodiode detector, according to our previously established procedure.10 Thus the fraction of injected electrons is Ne,TiO2/N0 = 25%. We therefore conclude that electron injection into mesoporous TiO2 is only a minor channel, and therefore most of the electrons (75%) move through the perovskite layer. This is consistent with the fact that perovskite carrier dynamics is fairly insensitive to whether it is deposited on a mesoporous TiO2 or large band-gap Al2O3 network.10,49–51

3.5 Effect of the wavelength and direction of the pump beam

Fig. 9 further supports our interpretation of the carrier dynamics by showing the influence of pump beam excitation wavelength and geometry (forward vs. reverse) on the relative yields of hole transfer and electron injection observed in the NIR transient absorption experiments. The excitation wavelengths 505 (green arrow) and 400 nm (blue arrow) were selected. The following elementary charge injection processes for holes (h+) and electrons (e−) must be considered: e−(MAPI, CB) → e−(TiO2, CB), λexc = 505 nm(1a) e−(MAPI, CB) → e−(TiO2, CB), λexc = 400 nm(1b) h+(MAPI, VB) → D0˙+(H101)(2) S1(H101) → D0˙+(H101) + e−(MAPI, CB), λexc = 400 nm(3)Upon 505 nm excitation of MAPI, we expect electron injection from the perovskite CB into the CB of TiO2(1a) and hole transfer from the perovskite VB to H101 forming the H101 radical cation D0˙+(2). Only for excitation at 400 nm, H101 can be electronically excited and also injects electrons into the perovskite CB (3), in addition to the other two processes (1b) and (2) (see the simplified band diagram in Fig. 9, top right). The time traces at 1500 nm for the eight possible combinations are consistent with this mechanism (see Fig. 9, bottom left): we consider the cases without H101 first: the black traces (A) and (E) have the same absorbance of 0.23 mOD at 1500 ps, indicating the same amount of relaxed electrons present in the CB of mesoporous TiO2(1a). The green traces (C) and (G) are also merging at the same ΔmOD (0.35), which is slightly larger than in the cases (A) and (E), i.e. process (1b).

The sharp decay in the sub-100 ps range, visible in all traces except for (G) and (H), is due to cooling of “hot” CB electrons and consistent with data of previous transient absorption studies by Lian and co-workers for electron injection from ruthenium dyes into mesoporous TiO2.33 The considerable change in the density of states upon cooling to the edge of the CB gives rise to a drastic reduction of the absorption cross section of the CB electrons. The transient absorption kinetics are adequately described by biexponential functions. Time constants and amplitudes are summarised in Table 1 and the individual fits are presented in the ESI,† (Fig. S6). The dominant (>60%) component τ1 is in the 20 to 40 ps range, and the minor component τ2 on the order of several 100 ps.

We conclude that the excess energy of the injected electrons in mesoporous TiO2 decreases in the order (C) > (A) > (E) > (G), because upon reverse excitation from the perovskite side, the CB electrons already lose their excess energy while travelling through the perovskite prior to any injection into TiO2. Note also that our observation rules out any assignment of the early-time decay to recombination of TiO2 CB electrons with holes in the perovskite VB. In that case, the same type of decay should be observed for forward and reverse excitation.
Secondly, we consider the configuration with additional H101 as top layer: the red traces (B) and (F) show the same ΔmOD (0.45) at 1500 ps, and this must represent the sum of the two processes (1a) and (2). In case (D), blue line, the ΔmOD at 1500 ps (0.70) is mainly due to the processes (1b) and (2), and larger than for (B) and (F) (ΔmOD = 0.45) because of the higher absorption coefficient of the perovskite at 400 nm. The strong perovskite absorption in case (D) also implies that process (3) can only have a minor influence. Finally, reverse excitation at 400 nm (H), blue line, showed the largest ΔmOD (1.48) at 1500 ps, which is due to the sum of all three processes (1b), (2) and (3). The relative yield of radical cations H101˙+ for reverse excitation at 400 nm was then ca. 450% larger than that for forward excitation at 505 nm, as seen in the contour plots for (H) and (G) and (B) and (A) in Fig. 9, bottom right. In this configuration, the HTM layer therefore clearly shows its contribution to harvest high-energy photons and therefore acts as an additional large band-gap absorber.
4. Conclusions
In summary, the current study provides plausible answers for several open questions regarding the interfacial charge carrier dynamics of perovskite thin films based on mesoporous TiO2 architectures: although electron injection from the perovskite into TiO2 takes place within the cross-correlation time, the majority of the electrons stay in the perovskite layer (75%) during the 2 ns time window studied. Hole injection at the perovskite/HTM interface happens in less than 500 fs. Nevertheless PL quenching is incomplete and must be due to imperfect contact between the layers and/or bottlenecks occurring during the hole transport from inside the perovskite layer to the nearest interface. This will delay the injection of holes considerably and increase the probability for radiative electron–hole recombination. Our study has also demonstrated the advantage of broadband NIR probing of the carrier dynamics in such films. Only TiO2 CB electrons and HTM radical cations absorb in this spectral region, and overlap with strong bleach and absorption features of the perovskite (as it is the case in the UV-Vis region) is avoided. In the NIR region, the dynamics of electrons and holes may be carefully separated by appropriate choice of experimental parameters such as excitation wavelength and geometry. We also note that our current results lead to a reassignment of previous NIR transient absorption data52,53 which ascribed transient absorption features to the perovskite and assumed the TiO2 CB electron absorption signal to be negligible. Both conclusions are not supported by the present data.
