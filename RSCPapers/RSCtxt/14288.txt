    First published on 14th February 2023AbstractFor many years, capturing, storing or sequestering CO2 from concentrated emission sources or from air has been a powerful technique for reducing atmospheric CO2. Moreover, the use of CO2 as a C1 building block to mitigate CO2 emissions and, at the same time, produce sustainable chemicals or fuels is a challenging and promising alternative to meet global demand for chemicals and energy. Hence, the chemical incorporation and conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals has received much attention in the last decade, since CO2 is an abundant, inexpensive, nontoxic, nonflammable, and renewable one-carbon building block. Nevertheless, CO2 is the most oxidized form of carbon, thermodynamically the most stable form and kinetically inert. Consequently, the chemical conversion of CO2 requires highly reactive, rich-energy substrates, highly stable products to be formed or harder reaction conditions. The use of catalysts constitutes an important tool in the development of sustainable chemistry, since catalysts increase the rate of the reaction without modifying the overall standard Gibbs energy in the reaction. Therefore, special attention has been paid to catalysis, and in particular to heterogeneous catalysis because of its environmentally friendly and recyclable nature attributed to simple separation and recovery, as well as its applicability to continuous reactor operations. Focusing on heterogeneous catalysts, we decided to center on zeolite and ordered mesoporous materials due to their high thermal and chemical stability and versatility, which make them good candidates for the design and development of catalysts for CO2 conversion. In the present review, we analyze the state of the art in the last 25 years and the potential opportunities for using zeolite and OMS (ordered mesoporous silica) based materials to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals essential for our daily lives and fuels, and to pave the way towards reducing carbon footprint. In this review, we have compiled, to the best of our knowledge, the different reactions involving catalysts based on zeolites and OMS to convert CO2 into cyclic and dialkyl carbonates, acyclic carbamates, 2-oxazolidones, carboxylic acids, methanol, dimethylether, methane, higher alcohols (C2+OH), C2+ (gasoline, olefins and aromatics), syngas (RWGS, dry reforming of methane and alcohols), olefins (oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes) and simple fuels by photoreduction. The use of advanced zeolite and OMS-based materials, and the development of new processes and technologies should provide a new impulse to boost the conversion of CO2 into chemicals and fuels.

A Introduction
1 Scope
Since 1850 and the beginning of the industrial revolution, human sources of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere have grown constantly and dramatically, at a rate of almost 3% each year. The CO2 emissions and population growth1 can be closely linked and world population, currently 7.8 billion, is expected to reach 9.1 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100. This population growth will mainly occur in developing countries. Besides, if until now the impact of developing countries over greenhouse gas emission has been negligible, this is now increasing and will continue to do so, due to the economic development needed to reduce poverty and the actual linkage of economic development, energy consumption and use of fossil hydrocarbons as the primary source of energy. However, this paradigm can be changed and, at present, several efforts are being devoted to energy generation on the bases of renewable sources.
The global warming is one of the main issues of the 21st century and it is principally due to CO2 and methane emissions. CO2 is a greenhouse gas present in the atmosphere at a concentration of 418 ppm.2 CO2 emissions are also related to ocean acidification, climate change and species extinction. For many years, the technologies of capture, storage or sequestration of CO2 from concentrated emission sources (natural gas and industrial processing) or air constitute powerful methods to reduce atmospheric CO2. Moreover, the capture technologies make CO2 available for its use in food processing and chemical industries. Incorporating anthropogenic CO2 and building chemicals is a way to pave a path towards a more sustainable and renewable carbon economy and neutrality, and constitutes a supplement to geological sequestration. Thus, our society is moving away from carbon capture and storage (CCS) to carbon capture and utilization (CCU). Consequently, the chemical incorporation and conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals has received much attention for the last decade. CO2 is an abundant, inexpensive, nontoxic, nonflammable, and renewable one-carbon building block. CO2 finds main purposes as green alternative to carbon monoxide and phosgene in the production of carbonates, carboxylic acids and derivatives. Nevertheless, CO2 is the most oxidized form of carbon, thermodynamically the most stable form and kinetically inert. Consequently, chemical conversion of CO2 requires highly reactive, rich-energy substrates, highly stable products to be formed or harder reaction conditions. In the context of low-carbon economy, the use of severe reaction conditions cannot be considered since the high-energy consumption also involves more CO2 emissions, unless the energy will be supplied by renewables sources. Some traditional thermal processes allow the CO2 incorporation into valuable products such as the synthesis of urea,3,4 salicylic acid5 and inorganic carbonates that do not require the use of catalysts to be industrially applied.6–8 Meanwhile, numerous catalytic transformations have been the center of several studies using organometallic complexes9 and heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts,10–13 and the incorporation of CO2 into chemicals such as urea derivatives, carbonates, carbamates, methanol and dimethyl-ether, alcohols, formic and carboxylic acids, alkanes, olefins and aromatics, among others, has been described.12,14–16 Nevertheless, the scope and efficiency of the reported CO2 transformations are narrow and have not been industrially applied due to the thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of CO2. Indeed, CO2 transformations usually require the use of a high ratio of organometallic compounds, solvent, additives associated with the production of large amounts of hazardous wastes and are generally performed under harsh reaction conditions.
In chemical processes, the use of catalysts constitutes an important tool for the development of sustainable chemistry. Indeed, catalysts increase the rate of reaction without modifying the overall standard Gibbs energy change in the reaction.17 Therefore, an adequate and effective activation of substrates (CO2) allows overcoming the energy barrier of the reaction, improving the reaction rate and selectivity. Consequently, highly efficient catalysts in terms of energy, selectivity, productivity and reusability are decisive to develop a sustainable and economic process (Fig. 1). Thus, in accordance with green chemistry and sustainability criteria, the development of effective and robust heterogeneous catalysts is crucial (Fig. 2).

Solid catalysts are attractive due to advantageous characteristics such as activity, robustness, efficiency, recovery and recycling, ease of handling that makes them economically advantageous, and environmentally friendly by minimizing waste. Focusing on heterogeneous catalysts, we will center here on ordered micro- and meso-porous materials because of the flexibility in their composition and pore structure system and their high surface area and because they are adjustable and customizable. Considering ordered microporous materials for CO2 conversion, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have exhibited catalytic activity for transforming CO2 into chemicals and several compilation works have been published in the last few years.12,16,18 Nevertheless, chemical, thermal and mechanical stability of MOFs19,20 is one of the major concerns. Indeed, chemical stability of MOFs in the presence of moisture, solvents, acids, bases, and potential coordinating anions could be limited.21 At the same time, the use of severe reaction conditions such as heat, vacuum or pressure generally undermines their structural stability. All these drawbacks have considerably hampered, MOF uses and applications so far. In contrast, zeolite (Fig. 3) and ordered mesoporous materials (Fig. 4) exhibit high thermal and chemical stability which makes them good candidates for the design and development of catalysts for CO2 conversion. For all of the above, the present review will offer a recompilation on the state of art of the use of zeolites and ordered mesoporous materials for the conversion of CO2 to chemicals and fuels.

2 Zeolites
Followed by ordered microporous materials, zeolites constitute the most important catalysts traditionally used in oil-refining and petrochemistry24 and find numerous applications as adsorbents, ions exchangers and finally as catalysts in many chemical processes.25,26 More specifically, zeolites are crystalline microporous aluminosilicates with cavities and pore topologies of molecular dimensions (Fig. 4). Zeolites are characterized by their high surface areas and shape/size selectivity along with the flexibility in their chemical compositions and the ability to accommodate different metals in their frameworks, resulting in acid/base or redox properties.27 Moreover, their high thermal stability makes them robust and readily reusable after the regeneration stage.
The versatility in the tetrahedra assembly lead to the diversity of zeolite structure with tridimensional framework constituted by cages and channels with molecular dimensions. Up to now, 235 natural and synthetic zeolite framework types have been recognized by the International Zeolite Association (IZA) and assigned with a three-letter code.28,29 Zeolites are characterized by dimensions of the channels conventionally defined by the ring size of the aperture. Accordingly, zeolites are classified as small-pore (≤8-ring), medium-pore (10-ring), large-pore (12-ring), and extra-large-pore zeolites (>12-ring). The microporous void space enables the access and diffusion of molecules with suitable size, shape, and polarity, well-known as shape-selectivity in zeolites. In some cases, the molecular dimensions of zeolites pore systems present severe limitations for the access, formation and diffusion of large molecules. Therefore different strategies were explored to improve the diffusion, increasing the zeolite pore sizes,30–33 decreasing crystal size,34–36 forming single layer zeolites (delaminated) or introducing mesoporosity into the zeolite crystals.37–40
The zeolite framework is formed by corner-sharing TO4 tetrahedra where T could be a metal or metalloid such as Si, Al, Fe, Ge, B, Ti, etc., while in the aluminophosphate family Al and P are predominant. The substitution of an atom by another with a lower valency such Si4+ with Al3+ or P5+ with Si4+ generates a negative charge on the framework which has to be compensated by a proton or a metallic cation that is responsible of the acid/base properties of the zeolites. Compositional and geometric factors are the main features that control the acid/base properties.
The basicity of the zeolites is associated with the presence of basic framework oxygen atoms, basic sites of the Lewis type, and their strength is related to the density of negative charge. Therefore, the zeolite basicity is a function of the nature of the framework atoms, the extra-framework cation nature and the zeolite structure. To modify and enhance the basic properties of zeolites two main approaches have been explored: the incorporation of alkali metal clusters and oxide/hydroxide particles or the variation of the nature of the cation framework or extra-framework with suitable physicochemical properties using low electronegativity cations such as alkali metal cations.41–44
In the same way, the partial substitution of Si atoms with Sn, Ti, or Zr introduces well-defined Lewis acid sites conferring new catalytic properties on the zeolite which are mainly governed by the metal coordination.45,46
Owing to their remarkable properties (Fig. 5) such as high hydrothermal stability, adsorption, acid/base and redox properties, availability and low production cost, zeolites have been widely and successfully used as efficient catalysts, adsorbents, and ion exchangers. Zeolites can also act as host for different compounds such as single atom, metal clusters or nanoparticles,47–51 molecular catalysts, organometallic species or forming composites with multi-functionalities.52,53 The preparation of these advanced multifunctional materials can be performed during the zeolite synthesis, by adsorption/impregnation, ion-exchange and assembly inside the pores and cages (ship-in-a-bottle), and with or without reaction with silanol groups of the surface (covalent bond). On the bases of the versatility of zeolites in composition, structure and catalytic properties and their industrial availability, zeolites can be active players for CO2 capture and conversion.

3 Ordered mesoporous silicates (OMS)
To overcome the limitations of the zeolite structure to the access, formation and diffusion of large molecules (kinetic diameter > 10 Å), many efforts have been made for the synthesis of mesopores within the zeolite crystals54–57 as well as for the synthesis of ordered mesoporous constructed from tetrahedral units (TO4) with different spatial orientations forming channels and cavities.58,59 In 1992, a new M41S family of ordered mesoporous silicates (OMS) was successfully synthesized through Mobil Oil Cooperation such as MCM-41 (hexagonal)60 and MCM-48 (cubic)61 with pore diameters >20 Å. The discovery of the new family of nanostructured mesoporous materials M41S by ExxonMobil marked a new breakthrough for the development of advanced catalysts for industrial processes.62 M41S materials offer adjustable and well-defined pore sizes (15–200 Å) with uniform shapes and ordered to some degree along micrometer length scales and amorphous silica walls. The MCM-41 material is the most known, studied and used (Fig. 6).63,64 In 1998, the family of ordered mesoporous silicates was extended by the synthesis of Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA) materials with a larger pore size ranging between 50 and 300 Å and improved thermal, mechanical and chemical stability (Fig. 6).63,65
 Fig. 6  Examples of zeolites and OMS. 
As it occurs for zeolites, the incorporation of Al in the mesostructure modifies the acidic/basic properties of the material with special relevance from catalytic standpoints. In the same way, the introduction of transition metals such as Ti, Sn, V and Cr into the framework or grafted on the surface allowed preparing materials with extended catalytic properties (Fig. 5).66–69
Moreover, the ordered mesoporous silica offers great opportunities for the deposition of cluster, nanoparticles and oxide with high dispersion owing to their high surface areas and large pore dimensions avoiding pore blockage and making possible the diffusion of metal precursors. In the same way, the functionalization of the surface with organic or inorganic functional groups of ordered mesoporous materials enables the efficient immobilization of biomolecules, organo-catalysts and metal-organo complexes via covalent bonding with silanol groups, conferring new physical and chemical properties.59,70,71 Therefore, modified ordered mesoporous materials find applications in a large variety of fields such as catalysis, host–guest chemistry, adsorption, separation, semiconductors, etc.60,72–75
4 Objectives
CO2 constitutes a non-toxic and non-flammable raw material. The use of CO2 as C1 building block is very attractive since it provides an eco-friendly process that fulfills numerous principles of “Green Chemistry”. Moreover, CO2 shifts from an undesirable waste to an alternative carbon feedstock. CO2 is the most oxidized form of carbon and so very stable. Consequently, chemical conversion of CO2 requires highly reactive/rich-energy substrates or strong reaction conditions (Fig. 1). Therefore, catalysis is key for CO2 conversion and the design of suitable catalysts will allow overcoming the kinetic barriers enabling new technologies for a sustainable transition to fossil sources. Accordingly, owing to the great features and customizable properties, industrial availability and thermal stability, zeolites and ordered mesoporous silicates may offer great opportunities for conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals in order to minimize, and perhaps revert, the greenhouse effect of anthropogenic CO2.76–79
Here, we present a critical review of the different reported concepts and findings on the mechanism, catalytic performance, catalyst types and strategy design in the direct successful conversion of CO2 into chemicals in the presence of advanced zeolites and OMS based materials. Although different reviews present CO2 conversions, this review differs in presenting the potential and versatility of zeolites and OMS and their capabilities to be engineered for preparing catalysts suitable for the development of industrial catalysts directed in the manufacture of a wide range of bulk, commodity, specialties and fine chemical products, polymers and fuels. Several chemical conversions of CO2 (Fig. 7) for the synthesis of carbonates (cyclic and dialkyl), carbamates (acyclic and 2-oxazolidinones), carboxylic acid through different chemical reactions such as cycloaddition, carboxylation and coupling are explored. Numerous CO2 conversions based on hydrogenation/reduction process for the production of MeOH, DME, C2+OH, CH4, or SYNGAS through RWGS are also reviewed. The main achievements for the production of gasoline, olefins and aromatics through CO2 hydrogenation undergoing CO2 modified Fischer Tropsch or methanol mediated route have been discussed taking into account several recent and very comprehensive reviews.11,80–89 The dry reforming of methane and alcohols with CO2 constitute other important pathways to produce SYNGAS and allow for a continuity in the production of a broad range of chemicals, commodities, specialties and fuels, currently manufactured from fossil resources. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to ensure a more sustainable and selective production of alkenes is also reviewed. Finally, the photocatalysis using zeolite and OMS-based materials for the reduction of CO2 to the production of solar fuels has been examined. Considering the environmental impact, economic cost and sustainability, an analysis of the different developed catalytic systems has been done based on the required reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure and catalyst efficiency and availability. From now on, in order to mitigate the effect of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, considering the global situation of energy deficiency, all processes that contemplate CO2 use and conversion, especially those involving high energy consumption, must use green and renewable energy, (sun, wind, and water), to be sustainable and efficient.

1 Synthesis of carbonates
Organic carbonates constitute an important class of intermediates that can be synthesized through sustainable and environmentally friendly processes using CO2 as raw materials, “the carbonyl green route”. Moreover, the synthesis of organic carbonates is an attractive, valuable and promising approach for CO2 utilization since it involves 100% atom economy. Organic carbonates constitute important green raw materials for the synthesis and substitution of a large number of toxic and/or volatile compounds such as phosgene, epoxides or cyanates, due to their special properties as polarity and solubility, good biodegradability, harmless and chemical versatility.90–93 Thus, they find application in numerous fields as intermediates, fine and commodity chemicals,94 solvents,95 agrochemicals, monomers for polymer industry,96 electrolytes for lithium ion batteries97 and also lubricants (Fig. 9).98–100 Organic carbonates have been synthesized conventionally by reacting highly toxic and hazardous phosgene with alcohols or diols.101 Every year, high amounts of organic cyclic and linear carbonates are produced for a total market of about 18 million tons per year within 80000 tons of cyclic carbonates of which 40000 tons per year are produced from CO2.102
 Fig. 9  Carbonate applications. 

1.1 Synthesis of cyclic carbonates. 
Cyclic carbonates find numerous applications due to their polarity, high boiling point, low toxicity and good biodegradability. Different direct synthetic pathways from CO2 can be followed to prepare cyclic carbonates from diols, epoxides, propargylic alcohols and olefins (Scheme 1).
 Scheme 1  Different pathways in the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from CO2. 
1.1.1 Synthesis of cyclic carbonates via cycloaddition. 
(a) Introduction. 
An attractive and important approach to convert CO2 is the catalytic coupling of CO2 with high-energy three-membered ring substrate or cycloaddition, especially, with epoxides and aziridines since important intermediates in the synthesis of chemicals and fine chemicals can be produced. Moreover, cycloaddition of CO2 and three-membered ring molecule is 100% atom economy reaction and is environmentally friendly, helping to mitigate the CO2 environment impact.
Cycloaddition usually involves three steps: ring opening, CO2 insertion and ring closure (Scheme 2).103–107 The ring opening is accelerated by a nucleophilic attack, for example, an halide, while the use of a Lewis acid or an hydrogen bond donor induce the polarization of the epoxide ring, while the use of a Lewis base favours the adsorption and activation of CO2.
 Scheme 2  Possible mechanism of cycloaddition for the preparation of cyclic carbonates or oxazolidinones assisted by nucleophile attack (X−). 
Cyclic carbonates have conventionally been synthesized by reacting harmful reactant phosgene with diols, with the corresponding formation of hydrochloric acid.108 Then, the synthesis of five-membered cyclic carbonates via cycloaddition of epoxides with CO2 constitutes a straightforward, green and safe alternative to toxic reagents, such as phosgene or its derivatives. Therefore, considering “green chemistry” and “atom economy” principles, cycloaddition represents a very attractive process. Cyclic carbonates109 are stable and find a large number of applications in the chemical industry,110,111 specially in the polymer industry (adhesives and foams).112 Moreover, a peculiarity of organic carbonates is their non-toxicity, good biodegradability and their high boiling point and high solvency making them useful aprotic polar solvents.113 The preparation of carbonate constitutes a great case of CO2 application as a chemical feedstock with economic and environmental benefits.
(b) Reaction mechanism. 
The synthesis of cyclic carbonate incorporating CO2 involves three steps: firstly the epoxide ring-opening (rate determining step),114 followed by the CO2 insertion and finally, the carbonate ring-closure.115,116 Different designs of catalytic systems have been followed considering CO2 and/or epoxide molecules activation. Usually, the catalytic system is composed by one or two catalytic functions consisting of a Lewis acid center for the activation of epoxide and/or CO2 molecules and a Lewis base center that acts as a nucleophile. Scheme 3 illustrates different activation mechanisms taking into account various catalytic systems. One of them involves the use of a N-based co-catalyst such as tetra-alkyl ammonium halide though this constitutes the main drawbacks from environmental and economic standpoints (Scheme 4). Homogeneous organocatalysts were developed that constitute an attractive alternative since they offer different advantages such as price, readily availability and free metal contaminants. The catalytic properties of several organocatalysts based on ammonium,117,118 phosphonium,119–121 and imidazolium salts,122–124 as well as organic amines125 have been reported. Nevertheless, organocatalysts present some drawbacks such as low activity and requirement of high loading and harder reaction conditions. Numerous group III–V transition metal complexes have been used as Lewis acid catalysts in the homogeneous and heterogeneous phases to perform cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides.126 A large number of works reported the use of metal complex catalysts such as zinc107 and aluminum alkyls, tin complexes,127,128 organoantimony halide or alkali metal salts129 in the presence of a basic co-catalyst for the preparation of cyclic carbonates. Nevertheless, despite the high catalytic activity, their use involves important limitations such as toxicity, water and air sensitivity, catalyst recycle, tedious handle and work-up, hazardous waste production and severe reaction conditions (temperatures, CO2 pressure), which prevent industrial application due to high energy and economical costs. Therefore, the interest to develop new heterogeneous and multifunctional catalysts is constant and topical, and numerous attempts have been reported in the literature.117,130

(c) Zeolite-based catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates. 
(i) Basic zeolites. Given that CO2 is acidic and inert, the increase of catalyst basicity is required to promote CO2 adsorption, activation and reactivity.131 Since zeolites are well-known for their intrinsic acid catalytic properties, their use for the activation of CO2 is not possible when in acidic form, and strategic modifications or functionalization are required in order to increase their basic properties. In the case of zeolites (silicoaluminates), different strategies were studied to modify the basicity,132 which is associated with the presence of the framework oxygen atoms, and their strength is related to the density of negative charge. Consequently, the zeolite basicity, i.e. the negative charge on the oxygen atom, is a function of the framework and extra-framework composition and zeolite structure, as was said before. Calculation of the average Sanderson electronegativity allows quantitative determination of the average charge on the oxygen when the framework composition is varied.132–134 To modify and enhance the basic properties of zeolites two main approaches have been explored.41–44 The first consists in introducing alkali metal clusters and oxide/hydroxide particles within the pore system, and the second attempt to modify the intrinsic basicity of the framework oxygen varying the cation framework or the exchange of cations with low electronegativity cations such as alkali metal cations, in extra-framework positions.
* Cation exchanged zeolites as catalysts for the preparation of cyclic carbonates. The cycloaddition of CO2 with various epoxides on Cs/KX zeolite through a Lewis base activation mechanism (Schemes 2 and 3) has been explored. The catalytic performance of Cs/KX131,135 zeolite was compared to different solid bases such as KX, Cs/Al2O3 and MgO at 140 °C and 2 MPa CO2 pressure. For all cases the carbonates yields were low and maximum 19% 1,3-dioxolan-2-one yield was reached in the presence of Cs/KX (Table 1, entries 1 and 2; Scheme 5). This study revealed that reactivity was influenced by base strength, porosity, and Lewis acidity of the catalysts.

 Scheme 5  Formation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of Cs-KX zeolites. 
The catalytic performance of various alkali- and alkaline-earth-exchanged ETS-10 zeolites was compared for the cycloaddition to produce propylene carbonate at 135 °C and 0.2 MPa CO2 pressure.136,137 The alkali-exchanged catalysts exhibited significantly higher activity than the alkaline-earth-exchanged catalysts. The difference in activities was found to be directly associated with the partial negative charge of the oxygen atoms in the structure; the higher the basic strength, the higher the catalytic activity, the basic strength being controlled by the electropositivity of the extra-framework cation.132 Additional studies with exchanged X and ETS-10 zeolites showed that the presence of water enhanced the reaction rate owing to the enhancement of the Brønsted acidity. Adsorption of small amounts of water contributed to the formation of surface OH groups and induced better-tuned acid–base active sites required for the cycloaddition as was presented before when discussing the reaction mechanism.137 Nevertheless, the carbonate yield remained low <15% (Table 1, entries 3 and 4; Scheme 6), as a consequence of the usually weak basicity presented by zeolites and which is an important issue for CO2 activation.
 Scheme 6  Formation of propylene carbonate in the presence of exchanged ETS-10 zeolites. 
* Effect of the framework cation substitution in zeolites on the catalytic activity for cyclic carbonates production.
– Phosphorous framework. The introduction of phosphorous in a zeolite framework can result in materials with basic properties such as SAPOs (silicoaluminophosphate)138 and ALPOs139 (aluminophosphate crystalline microporous aluminophosphate materials). In line, a microporous silicoaluminophosphate SAPO-56 with the AFX topology (tridimensional small pore structure with cages) was tested as a catalyst for the synthesis of chloropropene carbonate. The small pore size (∼3.4 × 3.6 Å) is similar to the kinetic diameter of several gas molecules, especially CO2. Therefore, SAPO-56 offers special characteristics for CO2 capture and/or conversion.140–142 The synthesis was performed under microwave heating, and its catalytic properties due to both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites associated with Al framework atoms and OH groups were checked for the synthesis of chloropropene carbonate.143 A good catalytic performance was registered for SAPO-56 synthesized under microwaves, with 84.8% chloropropene carbonate yield, at 110 °C, 0.1 MPa CO2 pressure; besides this sample presented a lower amount of Brønsted acid sites 1.240 versus 1.701 mmol g−1 (Table 1, entry 5). The recyclability of the samples was checked and no noticeable change in the catalytic performance of both catalysts was observed. SAPO-56 presents interesting catalytic properties and stability and is a low-cost catalyst. Nevertheless, further literature search within the patent and open literature indicated that the investigation was not pursued.
– Alkaline-earth metal ion framework. Recently, different approaches were explored for the construction of basic Al-free zeolites by the framework incorporation of metal ions with low electronegativity and so create new basic sites with improved basicity. Likewise, a family of alkaline-earth metal ions (Mg, Ca, Sr or Ba)-silicalite-1, MS-1 metallosilicate zeolites, through direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis was reported.144 Accordingly, alkaline-earth metal framework-substituted ZSM-12 zeolites were prepared and specifically Al-free Mg–Si-ZSM-12 zeolites with unidimensional 12 member ring pores (12MR) and different Mg contents were prepared with mostly tetrahedral Mg species, stable in contact with water (Fig. 10).

Accordingly, the cycloaddition of different substituted epoxides was performed in the presence of Mg–Si-ZSM-12 and a widely used efficient co-catalyst, tetrabutylammonium bromide.145 The Mg–Si-ZSM-12/tetrabutylammonium bromide catalytic system exhibited high catalytic activity for the cycloaddition of CO2 with various aromatic, alkyl and etheryl epoxides producing cyclic carbonates with high yield and selectivity at relatively low temperatures (60–90 °C) and 0.1 MPa CO2 pressure (Scheme 7). The catalytic performance of Mg–Si-ZSM-12 was compared with those of Mg-containing silicalite-1 (MgS-1) and MgO. With MgS-1 and MgO the conversion was 70 and 75%, respectively, while the conversion was 95% in the presence of Mg–Si-ZSM-12 under identical reaction conditions. The higher activity was attributed to the higher strength of the basic sites Mg–Si-ZSM-12 (Table 1, entries 6–10). A recycling test revealed the stability of styrene oxide conversion and selectivity to phenyl dioxolane over five runs. These results evidence the high efficiency of Mg-containing MTW zeolite for CO2 fixation under mild conditions.
 Scheme 7  Formation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of the Mg–Si-ZSM-12/(Bu)4N+Br− catalytic system. 
(ii) Effect of the presence of Lewis acid sites in zeolites on the catalytic activity for cyclic carbonates production. A multifunctional Zn–HZSM-5 catalyst with Brønsted acidity (acid T-OT hydroxyls), Lewis acidity (non-framework Al and Zn sites) and Lewis basicity was used as catalyst in the presence of tetra-n-propylammonium bromide (nPr4NBr) for the preparation of different cyclic carbonates with high yield and selectivity at 140 °C and 3 MPa CO2 pressure.146,147 The high availability of active centers make possible the optimum activation of CO2 over metallic center and activation of epoxides over both the metal center and through the hydrogen bond. Then, high catalytic activity was achieved with high yield (up to 99%) in the presence of nPr4NBr for the preparation of various alkyl, aromatic and ether epoxides (Table 1, entries 11–18; Scheme 8). Larger scale experiments were performed and showed that the reproducibility of the process and one reuse of the catalyst was successful. The main issue of the procedure is the use of 0.5 mol% of nPr4NBr and relative high CO2 pressure. However, this multifunctional heterogeneous zeolitic catalyst can be considered as a possible path to the incorporation of upgrading CO2 into valuable chemicals. Further literature search for this catalytic system within the patent and open literature indicated nevertheless that the investigation was not pursued.
 Scheme 8  Formation of propylene carbonate in the presence of Zn-ZSM-5 zeolites. 
The catalytic performance of titanosilicate molecular sieves TS-1 and TiMCM-41 bearing Lewis acid active sites, in the presence of a N-based co-catalyst, was explored to prepare cyclic and linear carbonates by cycloaddition with CO2, following the mechanism in Scheme 4.148,149 The authors claimed a possible synergy between the catalyst and the co-catalyst, the nucleophilicity of the nitrogen atom being increased by the electrophilic interaction of the Ti4+ with the epoxide. High yields were achieved at 120–140 °C, 0.69 MPa CO2 pressure, starting from epoxides or olefins. Moreover, the reaction can occur without CH2Cl2 as solvent. However, the reported catalytic data are low and the zeolite based catalysts cannot be considered as efficient in term of activity and selectivity under mild reaction conditions (Table 1, entries 19–23).
(iii) Zeolite catalysts incorporating quaternary ammonium halide for cyclic carbonate production. Structure directing agents (SDA) play a fundamental role in the nucleation and crystal growth steps during zeolite synthesis, and they have to be extracted or burned off from the crystallized zeolite, to make the pore system free and accessible. However, one way to take advantage of the SDA is to use it as a catalyst.150,151 However, for their use as catalysts, SDA-zeolite composite materials have to present high stability against leaching and severe reaction conditions; moreover, active sites have to be accessible. Following this approach, highly efficient organic–inorganic hybrid zeolites have been prepared by halogen anion-exchange.152 Indeed, instead of extracting the SDA, lamellar MFI materials prepared with C18H37Me2N+(CH2)6N+Pr3]Br2− as SDA were used directly as active sites ion-exchanged with various halogen anions (I−, Cl− and Br−) (Fig. 11). As aforementioned, quaternary ammonium halides have been widely used to perform the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxide. The iodide exchange material LMFI-I was the most efficient catalyst for the cycloaddition of CO2 with different epoxides. The authors showed the cooperation between ammonium cations of the SDAs and the iodide anions to catalyze the selective cycloaddition of CO2 and different epoxides without solvent and additives, at 140 °C and 2 Mpa CO2 pressure, with conversion and selectivity of up to 99 and 95%, respectively (Table 1, entries 24–28).
 Fig. 11  Cycloaddition of epoxides and CO2 over a halogen anion-exchanged hybrid zeolite catalyst. Reprinted with permission from ref. 152. Copyright 2014, Royal Society of Chemistry. 
The cycloaddition mechanism involves the approach of the epoxide molecule to the accessible ammonium cation followed by the iodide attack, leading to an oxy-anion which in turn attacks the carbon dioxide to finally reach ring closure (Scheme 2). The hybrid material exhibited good stability and reusability. The chloroethylene carbonate yield was stable at around 90% for the first three runs and decreased to 79% for the fourth use, retaining the selectivity constant at 95%. This approach provides a catalyst with an interesting catalytic performance and potential.
Following the same strategy, a mesoporous TS-1 zeolite (MTS-1) was prepared using polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) as the structure directing agent (SDA). The mesoporous TS-1 zeolite incorporating the SDA offers both Lewis basic sites and Lewis acid sites associated with the presence of SDA and Ti species framework. The bifunctional catalyst exhibited good catalytic properties for the cycloaddition reaction after treatment with hydrochloric acid. The yield of chloropropene carbonate was up to 98% at 120 °C, 1.6 Mpa CO2 pressure for 6 h and in acetonitrile as solvent (Scheme 9). The mesoporous-TS-1 catalyst was reused for 4 runs without noticeable deactivation which was attributed to the high stability of the zeolite structure and template agents that did not diffuse out of the pores. Following the same procedure, propene, styrene and isobutylene carbonates were obtained with 80, 35 and 14 yield%, respectively, showing a limited scope of the catalyst together with the necessity to use a solvent (Table 1, entries 29–32).153 This material presented limited accessibility to the active sites due to poor pore channel connectivity and low surface areas and pore volume.
 Scheme 9  Formation of chloropropene carbonate in the presence of the MTS-1-PDDA zeolite catalyst. 
Recently, a basic ZSM-5154 zeolite with mesopores has been prepared using 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane as the structure directing agent and the calcined sample was reacted with aqueous ammonia to provide a basic ZSM-5 with mesopores in the crystallites. Basic-Meso-ZSM-5 exhibited higher activity than Meso-ZSM-5 for the cycloaddition in ionic liquid media. Nevertheless, the activity of Basic-Meso-ZSM-5 is low with yields close to 7% for the synthesis of chloroethylene carbonate. The author attributed the low activity to the no-CO2 activation. When, the cycloaddition was performed in the presence of N,N-dimethyl amino pyridine (DMAP), the yield increased up to 80%, and the catalytic composition was successfully used for the synthesis of different carbonates at 120 °C and 0.8 Mpa CO2 pressure (Table 1, entries 33–35). Nevertheless, the catalytic data of DMAP alone under the same reaction conditions were not reported.
An interesting mesoporous zeolite–chitosan composite (ZY-CS) with high thermal stability was prepared from a Serbian zeolite (kinoptiolite) and chitosan (CS). Characterization study showed that ZY was uniformly dispersed in the CS matrix incorporating negatively charged sites of Al-zeolite (Si–O−) and the positively charged sites of chitosan (NH3+). Furthermore, the ZY-CS composite presented enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity due to the mesoporous structure and interaction sites, favourable for the adsorption and activation of CO2. The catalytic properties of the CS and ZY-CS composite were checked for the cycloaddition reaction between CO2 and epoxides in the presence of a co-catalyst TBAI (tetra-n-butylammonium iodide) to activate CO2. Moderate to low propylene carbonate yields of 61% and 32% in the presence of ZY-CS and CS were achieved, respectively, after 6 h of reaction time, 100 °C and 1 Mpa CO2 pressure while for chloropropene carbonate the yield was 99.5% (Table 1, entries 36–38; Scheme 10).155 These results indicated a reduced scope of the catalyst.
 Scheme 10  Formation of the cyclic carbonate in the presence of the ZY-CS/TBAI catalyst. 
(iv) Encapsulation of organometallic complexes into zeolites for cyclic carbonates production. Other strategies to heterogenise active metal complexes consist in encapsulating the catalytic active species. Indeed, zeolites offer the possibility of coupling the shape selectivity of their pore system (channels and cages) with the specific reactivity of metal complexes. The zeolite structure makes possible the trapping of metal complex inside the pores without bonding to the surface, named as “ship-in-a-bottle”,156 and refers to zeolite encapsulated metal chelates and cluster complexes. Metal phthalocyanines were also encapsulated in Y zeolite and their efficient catalytic activity in the presence of N-based co-catalysts (Lewis base) was reported for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates.157,158 The catalytic performance of zeolite-Y-encapsulated complexes was higher than the homogeneous and silica-supported phthalocyanine complexes ones. The catalytic activity for the synthesis of chloropropene carbonate of different metal complexes were compared and followed the order Co < Ni < Cu. A study of addition of a Lewis-base as the co-catalyst showed the highest activity with N,N-dimethyl aminopyridine (DMAP) (mechanism Scheme 4). For the synthesis of chloropropene carbonate, the best catalytic data were achieved in the presence of AlPc-Y at 120 °C (98% conversion, 100% selectivity) (Table 1, entries 39 and 40; Scheme 11). It is well known that Lewis bases form coordination complexes with metal phthalocyanines and that polar solvents compete with the Lewis bases to form the complex and modify the activity.159 Therefore, under optimised reaction conditions, in dichloromethane, at 120 °C and 0.69 Mpa CO2 pressure, carbonates yields up to 98 and 93% using epichlorohydrin and propylene oxide as epoxide, respectively, were obtained. The AlPc-Y hybrid catalyst was reused for three consecutive runs without loss of activity and selectivity. A good catalytic performance is exhibited but the tedious preparation and catalyst cost may limit its application.
 Scheme 11  Formation of chloropropene carbonate in the presence of AlPc-Y/DMAP catalyst. 
Co and Mn supported metalloporphyrins on NaX were prepared, characterized and used as catalysts in the presence of phenyltrimethylammonium tribromide as the co-catalyst for the preparation of propylene carbonate. NaX supported tetra-metalloporphyrin catalysts exhibited higher catalytic results than unsupported ones. Maximum 95.6% PC selectivity at 94.5% conversion, at 120 °C for 5 h and 3 Mpa CO2 pressure was reached in the presence of a Co porphyrin supported complex that could be successfully reused three times (Table 1, entry 41).160 This type of catalyst exhibits good catalytic performance; however, their economic cost prevents their application.
(v) Immobilization of ionic liquids into zeolites for cyclic carbonate production. In the last twenty years, the discovery and use of ionic liquids has received much interest from the scientific community and has been the subject of numerous publications.161,162 Ionic liquids (Ils) such as quaternary ammonium, phosphonium, imidazolium and pyridinium and their functionalised forms have found numerous application in organic chemistry and chemical process as catalysts or solvents. The catalytic activity of Ils and supported Ils to perform the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxides was explored and revealed the suitable catalytic properties of imidazolium based ionic liquids.163–165
The functionalization of nanocrystalline zeolite (Nano-ZSM-5) with various amines (primary, secondary, and tertiary) subsequently converted into quaternary ammonium hydroxide and basic ionic liquids was described for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates.166 Catalytic results showed that in the amine based catalysts, the activity decreased in the following order: tertiary > secondary > primary amine, and the Ils-functionalized catalysts exhibited higher catalytic performance than amine-functionalized ones. Moreover, OH− based Ils exhibited better activity than HCO3− and Cl−. Basic-Nano-ZSM-5-Pr-MIM-OH exhibited the highest activity for the cycloaddition of CO2 and epichlorohydrin and other aliphatic and aromatic epoxides, at 0.8 Mpa CO2 pressure, 120 °C and 4–12 hours (Table 1, entries 42–44; Scheme 12). The recycling study showed that catalyst structure and properties were stable for five times recycling.
 Scheme 12  Preparation of cyclic carbonate in the presence of the basic-Nano-ZSM-5-Pr-MIM-OH catalyst. 
The immobilization through chemical bonding of three poly-epichlorohydrin-methylimidazole (polyether (PECH) imidazole) ionic liquids (PIILs) with amino, hydroxyl and carboxylic groups and the integrated co-catalyst, ZnBr2, on ZSM-5 zeolite was attempted, and their catalytic performance for cycloaddition reaction was explored. The three immobilized catalysts consist of polyether macromolecular chains as the main chains and imidazole rings as the branched chains. ZSM-5-HOOC-[PECH-MIM]Cl/[ZnBr2] exhibited the best catalytic performance that was attributed to small amount of HOOC-[PECH-MIM]Cl/[ZnBr2] physically adsorbed, providing acid ability for ring opening. Therefore, propylene carbonate was synthesized at 130 °C, 2.5 Mpa CO2 pressure, and 0.75 h, with 98.3% conversion and 97.4% selectivity. The reuse study showed that the good catalytic activity was maintained after eight cycles (68.6% yield) (Table 1, entry 45; Scheme 13).167
 Scheme 13  Preparation of propylene carbonate in the presence of the ZSM-5-PIIL/[ZnBr2] catalyst. 
(d) OMS-based catalysts for the preparation of cyclic carbonates. 
Mesoporous molecular sieves offer numerous opportunities as catalysts and supports due to their properties such as adjustable pore diameter, sharp pore distribution, large surface area and pore volume. Moreover, the presence of silanol groups on the surface enables chemical modifications through covalent bonding. Accordingly, many efforts have been devoted to the heterogenisation of metal organic species and organocatalysts using ordered mesoporous materials.
(i) Supported organocatalysts onto OMS for the preparation of cyclic carbonates.
* Supported amine onto OMS. Organic amines and supported ones have been reported to catalyse the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxides,168 and so far, the mechanism in the presence of an organic base has not been well explored. One attempt to heterogenise guanidine MTBD (7-methyl-1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene) on MCM-41 to perform the cycloaddition of various substituted epoxides with CO2 was reported.169 Nevertheless, the results were lower in the presence of the heterogeneous guanidine than with the homogeneous one and long reaction times were required (70 h) for the synthesis of cyclic carbonate, at 140 °C and 0.5 Mpa CO2 pressure (Table 1, entries 46–51; Scheme 14). However, MCM-41-TBD showed the great advantage of solid catalysts that could be reused successfully, at least, for three recycles.
 Scheme 14  Preparation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of MCM-41-TBD. 
A bifunctional based MCM-41 material bearing Lewis acid and basic sites due to the presence of Zr framework and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane was synthesized (APTES@ZrO2-MCM-41).170 The cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxide follows a mechanism of double activation through CO2 activation by the amine functional group (nucleophile) and epoxide ring opening activation by Lewis acid sites through Zr atoms. The scope of the catalyst was shown through the preparation of different cyclic carbonates with yields of up to 95%, in the presence of tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) as the co-catalyst, under 2 Mpa CO2 pressure, 80 °C, without solvent and 3 h of reaction time. Moreover, the catalyst was recycled for five runs with negligible loss of activity (Table 1, entries 52–56; Scheme 15).
 Scheme 15  Preparation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of APTES@ZrO2-MCM-41/TBAI. 
* Immobilization of quaternary ammonium salts onto OMS. As aforementioned, quaternary ammonium salts exhibit high catalytic activity for the cycloaddition of epoxide and CO2. Considering the fact that silanol groups on the surface open possibilities of chemical modifications through covalent bonding, the condensations of different type of organo-silanes with OH groups were performed for the functionalisation of the mesoporous surface. Following this synthetic strategy, mesoporous molecular sieve catalysts based on alkylammonium and imidazolium (ionic liquids) have been prepared and used for the preparation of cyclic carbonates. In 2010, a heterogeneous bifunctional MCM-41 catalyst with grafted quaternary ammonium salt with a terminal amino group was synthesized and used as the catalyst for the preparation of cyclic carbonate by cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxide followed by the transesterification with methanol to provide dimethyl carbonate. The bifunctional catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity and reusability for the preparation of numerous cyclic carbonates with yields up to 99%, at 120 °C and 2 Mpa CO2 pressure (Table 1, entries 57–63; Scheme 16).171 This hybrid catalyst showed suitable catalytic performance with a wide scope and high reusability. The results are interesting and there is an incentive to achieve a lower cost catalyst, based on this concept, for industrial applications.
 Scheme 16  Preparation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of the bifunctional MCM-41 catalyst. 
An improved bifunctional Zn/SBA-15 supported ammonium salt (NH4I-Zn/SBA-15) as a single-component heterogeneous catalyst for cycloaddition was developed. Previously, a reported Zn/SBA-15 catalyst coupled with DMF showed good catalytic properties for the cycloaddition of CO2 with propylene oxide.172 In the catalytic process, zinc active sites acted as the Lewis acid activating epoxide and in ring opening, while DMF acted as co-catalyst to activate CO2 for further conversion. However, the Zn/SBA-15/DMF catalyst presented drawbacks such as the need for a co-catalyst and leaching. Then, the new NH4I-Zn/SBA-15 composite exhibiting a higher catalytic performance, 93% yield and 99% selectivity for the synthesis of propylene carbonate at 130 °C, 3 Mpa CO2 pressure and 12 h, without a co-catalyst, was obtained (Table 1, entries 64–68; Scheme 17). In addition, other cyclic carbonates can be prepared, and the catalyst can be easily reused with slight loss of activity after five recycles.173
 Scheme 17  Preparation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of the NH4I-Zn/SBA-15 composite. 
The catalytic performance of ammonium salt grafted on SBA-15 and MCM-41 materials were compared for the synthesis of styrene and hexene carbonates at room temperature, 0.3 Mpa CO2 pressure and without solvent.174 The MCM-41 catalyst exhibited higher activity than the SBA-15 catalyst. Furthermore, the recycle study showed higher recyclability of MCM-41 catalyst than SBA-15, since styrene carbonate yield was maintained for four cycles with the MCM-41 catalysts, while in the presence of SBA-15 catalyst the yield decreases after the third cycle from 86% to 20% (Table 1, entries 69 and 70; Scheme 18). These materials worked under mild reaction conditions, at atmospheric pressure and room temperature, which made them interesting for a possible application in the flow process.

Similarly, the preparation and catalytic performance of N,N,N-tributyl-N-propylammonium iodide-functionalized on silica gel and SBA-15 was reported, and the synergetic effect of the silanol groups and tetrabutylammonium iodide salt was demonstrated.175 Styrene and 1,2-butylenecarbonates were synthesized under mild conditions, 1 Mpa CO2 pressure, 100 °C for 4 h (Table 1, entries 71 and 72, Scheme 19). However, the reusability of the catalysts showed to be dependent on the nature of the support and the substrate.
 Scheme 19  Preparation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of N,N,N-tributyl-N-propylammonium iodide-functionalized on SBA-15. 
Likewise, the SBA-15-based catalyst exhibited a constant catalytic activity for five runs for 1,2-butylenecarbonate synthesis and a constant decrease of catalytic activity for styrene carbonate synthesis. More recently, a propyl-triethanol-ammonium iodide grafted SBA-15 catalyst (TEA/SBA-15) was synthesized and successfully used in cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides at 110 °C and 2.0 Mpa CO2 pressure. The incorporation of OH groups introduces an important function for the activation of epoxides by the hydrogen-bonding donor group, favouring the ring opening and nucleophilic iodide attack. High yields were obtained and TEA/SBA-15 catalyst could be reused with good stability, at least for five runs, with a propylene carbonate yield, >90%, and constant selectivity (99%) (Table 1, entries 73–77; Scheme 20).176
 Scheme 20  Preparation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of the propyl-triethanol-ammonium iodide SBA-15 catalyst. 
The possibility of using organic templates (SDA) employed for the synthesis of micro and mesoporous materials as active sites for catalyzing the synthesis of cyclic carbonates using CO2 has also been considered. Following that strategy, the as-synthesized MCM-41 with cetyltrimethyl ammonium as the template was shown to be an active and reusable catalyst for the synthesis of different cyclic carbonates at 120 °C, 0.69 Mpa CO2 pressure and without a solvent or co-catalyst.177 Chloropropene, propene, styrene and butylene carbonates were obtained with 90–99% (Table 1, entries 78–81; Scheme 21). The MCM-41 catalyst was recycled eight times and unfortunately the catalytic activity decreased after fifth time recycling. The decrease in activity was attributed to partial loss of crystallinity (long-range ordering) of the catalyst. Interestingly, the as synthesized hybrid material offered interesting catalytic behavior under mild reaction conditions. Moreover, aryl carbamates via the reaction of amines, CO2 and alkyl halides could be prepared.
 Scheme 21  Preparation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of as-synthesized MCM-41 with cetyltrimethyl ammonium as the catalyst. 
In 2020, the catalytic performance of two types of bi-functional iron doped mesoporous materials, Fe-HMS and Fe-MCM-41 containing the organic template (PDDA: Poly(diallyldimethylammonium) was explored as a catalyst for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates. The presence of PDDA and framework Fe species provide basic and acidic active sites, exhibiting a synergetic effect and high catalytic activity for the cycloaddition.178 CO2-TPD revealed that Fe-HMS offered more accessible basic sites and exhibited the highest activity. Moreover, the Fe-HMS material showed higher stability and reusability than Fe-MCM-41. The Fe-MCM-41 deactivation was attributed to leaching of active species and low accessibility of the active site due to poor pore structure. In the presence of Fe-MCM-41 catalyst, good 79.7 yield% of chloropropene carbonate was obtained (Table 1, entry 82; Scheme 22). Unfortunately, the catalyst showed limited reusability.

* Immobilization of ionic liquid onto OMS. As was mentioned above, the catalytic activity of ionic liquids and supported ionic liquids for cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxides was reported, as well as the suitable catalytic properties of imidazolium based ionic liquids.163–165 Likewise, hybrid MCM-41 materials were prepared by immobilization of ionic liquids (Ils) (pyridine, triethyl (TEA), trihexyl and triethanol amine).179 The study showed the effect of different parameters such as the number of active ammonium centres and steric and inductive effects, while moderate to low yield of allyl glycidyl carbonate were obtained, the highest yield and selectivity being 69.5% and 88.5%, respectively, in the presence of TEA-MS41, at 110 °C and 0.76 MPa CO2 pressure (Table 1, entry 83; Scheme 23).
 Scheme 23  Preparation of allyl glycidyl carbonate in the presence of the propyl-triethanol ammonium chloride/MCM-41 catalyst. 
More recently, the immobilization of imidazole (Imi) on MCM-41 (MCM-41-Imi/Br) and catalytic activity for cycloaddition was reported and styrene carbonate was successfully synthesized under solvent free conditions, 2 MPa CO2 pressure and 90–120 °C.180,181 The quaternary imidazolium center activates CO2 molecule providing a carbamate anion while ring opening of the epoxide occurs via the bromide ion attack. A study of reusability showed a constant decrease in the conversion from 100 to 85% along four recycles (Table 1, entries 84–88; Scheme 24). The loss in activity was attributed to the loss of bromide ions.
 Scheme 24  Preparation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of the MCM-41-Imi/Br catalyst. 
More recently, the same group reported the preparation and catalytic activity of MCM-41 functionalized imidazolium-allyl bromide ionic liquid (MCM-41-Imi/All-Br) for the preparation of cyclic carbonates. MCM-41-Imi/All-Br exhibited moderate catalytic activity for the cycloaddition of CO2 and different epoxides with yields of up to 68.8% of propylene carbonate, at 150 °C and 1.5 MPa CO2 pressure, without solvent. No data for the reusability of the hybrid material were reported (Table 1, entries 89–92; Scheme 25).182
 Scheme 25  Preparation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of the MCM-41-Imi/All-Br catalyst. 
Similarly, 1,2,4-triazolium-based ionic liquids (TRILs) were immobilized on SBA-15 and used for cycloaddition varying the catalyst and process parameters, such as functional groups, anions of the catalysts, temperature, pressure, reaction time and catalyst amount. Hydroxyl and carboxyl-functionalized 1,2,4-triazolium-based ILs immobilized on SBA-15 exhibited high catalytic performance due to the synergetic effect between OH or COOH groups and the bromide anions through hydrogen bond activation of the epoxide ring and nucleophilic attack, respectively. The catalyst showed good stability and could be reused over six cycles. At 110 °C and 2 MPa excellent yield and selectivity were achieved (Table 1, entries 93–98; Scheme 26).
 Scheme 26  Preparation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of the TRILs/SBA-15 catalyst. 
(ii) Immobilization of organometallic-complexes onto OMS for the preparation of cyclic carbonates. Metallophthalocyanines constitute an important class of organometallic compounds with reasonable cost and good chemical and thermal stability that have exhibited catalytic activity for different reactions.183–185 An aluminum phthalocyanine complex was covalently bonded to the MCM-41 surface and used as a heterogeneous catalyst for synthesis of cyclic carbonates from carbon dioxide and epoxides at 110 °C and 4 MPa CO2 pressure. The immobilized phthalocyanine complex activity was based on TOF calculations and remained constant for ten times recycling (Table 1, entries 99–102; Scheme 27).186
 Scheme 27  Preparation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of Cl-Al-Phthalocyanine/MCM-41 catalyst. 
(iii) Supported salts onto OMS for the preparation of cyclic carbonates. Alkali metal salts (Na, K, and Li) have been used to perform cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxide since they present some advantages such as abundance, low-cost, and non-toxicity.187 In contrast, their low activity made necessary the use of co-catalyst in large amounts. This together with a neutralization step were the main disadvantages from the environmental and industrial perspectives.188,189 Recently, an interesting low-cost supported KI/MCM-41 catalyst was prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method. The KI/MCM-41 catalyst with 35 wt% loading of KI exhibited very high catalytic activity for the synthesis of various carbonates with yields up to 96%, under 3 MPa CO2 pressure, 130 °C and 5 hours (Table 1, entries 103–107; Scheme 28). The catalyst was easily recovered and could be reused but a marked loss of activity was observed. In fact, the propylene carbonate yield decreased from 99.3 to 62.4% after the fourth use.190 The decrease in activity was attributed to possible adsorption of products and reagents that block accessibility to the active sites while no characterization of the data of the spent catalyst was performed.
 Scheme 28  Preparation of cyclic carbonates in the presence of the KI/MCM-41 catalyst. 
(e) Conclusions. 
A broad variety of advanced heterogeneous catalytic systems is reported in the bibliography, and some of them exhibited high catalytic behavior with good scope for the cycloaddition of epoxides with CO2. Nevertheless, some of the reported catalysts presented one or more disadvantages such as low stability, need for a co-catalyst, poor catalyst reusability or harsh operating conditions (high pressure and/or high temperature). Moreover, the catalyst cost remained high, especially if there was limited reusability and loss of efficiency along the runs. A catalytic system incorporating quaternary ammonium halide has shown to be efficient for the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxide. In this sense, the ability of zeolite and OMS as a host should be a reliable avenue for the development of an efficient and stable heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 cycloaddition with epoxide, due to the synergistic effects of the multifunctional active sites of quaternary ammonium halide, for one side, and for example of a Lewis acid present in the zeolite or OMS structure, for the other. Accordingly, among all examples, the possibility of using ordered micro and mesoporous materials incorporating the structure directing agents (SDAs) that can act as active sites for catalyzing the cycloaddition opens interesting opportunities since they moreover present high stability against leaching and hard reaction conditions and demonstrate recyclability. On the other hand, this approach lowers the cost of the catalyst which is limited to the cost of zeolite or mesoporous material synthesis, which in addition could be further calcined and used in other processes. Undoubtedly, the systematic study and understanding of the reaction mechanism, kinetics, thermodynamics, determination of reaction intermediates and active species due to the advantages of computational chemistry, and in situ and operando spectroscopy should allow a great understanding, to help rationalize experimental results and thus the design of new efficient zeolite and OMS-based catalysts and processes.
1.1.2 Synthesis of cyclic carbonates via olefin oxidative carboxylation. 
Since numerous epoxides are toxic, mutagenic and also expensive, an alternative route for the production of cyclic carbonates is the one-pot “oxidative carboxylation” of olefins and CO2 (Scheme 29). In comparison to epoxide and CO2 cycloaddition this synthetic approach is more economical, taking into account the alkene availability and cost. The strategies for this appealing synthetic approach are classified into two categories: two-step sequential reaction consisting of oxidation followed by carboxylation (cycloaddition), or direct oxidation and carboxylation in a single-step catalyzed by soluble catalysts, such as salen-complexes or ammonium salts192,193 and heterogeneous catalysts such as metal oxides.194
 Scheme 29  Olefin oxidative carboxylation for the preparation of cyclic carbonates. 
In the literature only few references relative to the direct olefin oxidative carboxylation in the presence of zeolites or ordered mesoporous silicate based catalysts were reported. The remarkable catalytic properties as oxidation catalysts of titanosilicate molecular sieves in the presence of H2O2 or TBHP as the oxidant have been widely reported and specifically for epoxidation of alkenes.195–198 Therefore, the use of titanosilicates for the preparation cyclic carbonates through a one-pot two-step process, based on epoxidation and cyclo-addition of the synthesized epoxide and CO2 constitutes an interesting strategy. Following this direction, a first attempt of the direct synthesis of cyclic carbonates from alkenes in the presence H2O2 or TBHP as the oxidant and titanium-silicalite-1 (TS-1) and mesoporous Ti-MCM-41 was reported. The preparation of cyclic carbonate was carried out in a two-step reaction by epoxidation at 60 °C followed by cycloaddition at 120 °C in the presence of DMAP as a co-catalyst (Scheme 30).
 Scheme 30  Preparation of cyclic carbonates by olefin oxidative carboxylation. 
In the presence of TS-1 catalyst, cyclic carbonates from allyl chloride and styrene using H2O2 as the oxidant could be obtained with 28% and 6%, respectively, while in the presence of Ti-MCM-41 and TBHP as the oxidant, with 13 and 33%, respectively, being the total cyclic carbonate low. TiMCM-41, with a larger pore diameter exhibited higher selectivity to cyclic carbonate formation than TS-1.
Recently, a class of titanium-grafted mesoporous silica catalysts was prepared starting from molecularly defined metal clusters. The organosol mixture of zero-valent Ti-clusters was impregnated onto the surface of ordered mesoporous silica molecular sieves (MCM-41 and MMM-2), that yielded dispersed non-single-site Ti(IV)nOx-like silica-supported catalyst after calcination.199 The prepared TinOx-MCM-41 catalyst was active in the oxidative carboxylation of styrene in the presence of TBABr as the co-catalyst, and styrene carbonate was produced with 35.6 and 40% yield and selectivity, respectively, at 70 °C, 0.8 MPa CO2 pressure, with 1.5 equivalent of TBHP (Scheme 31). The catalyst derived of zero-valent Ti-clusters impregnated on mesoporous mesophase MMM-2 silica, exhibited higher activity (67%) and selectivity (70%). These Ti(IV) highly dispersed catalysts presented good results towards oxidative carboxylation and open the path to the study and development of new redox based ordered mesoporous catalysts.
 Scheme 31  Preparation of styrene carbonate by olefin oxidative carboxylation. 
Walnut-like zeolite Al-LZ-276 with Phi zeolite structure was recently prepared by hydrothermal method and without organic template and further used as catalyst for the direct preparation of styrene carbonate in the presence of TBHP as oxidant and KI as co-catalyst.200 The authors proposed a two-step process with firstly styrene epoxidation catalyzed by LZ-276/TBHP-KI followed by cycloaddition catalyzed by LZ-276/KI. At 140 °C and 0.5 MPa CO2 pressure, 77% styrene carbonate yield was obtained after 10 h (Scheme 32). The blank control experiment demonstrated the catalytic contribution of the walnut-type zeolite catalyst, as 52% styrene carbonate yield without zeolite was achieved under the same reaction conditions. The recyclability test showed a marked deactivation of the zeolite during the four cycles with a decrease in styrene carbonate yield from 77 to 40%.
 Scheme 32  Preparation of styrene carbonate in the presence of LZ-276/TBHP-KI catalyst. 
In comparison to epoxide and CO2 cycloaddition, the oxidative carboxylation of olefin is a more economical synthetic route. However, up to now, few studies in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts, zeolites or OMS have been reported. Based on the remarkable catalytic properties as oxidation catalysts of titanosilicate molecular sieves and the possibility of design organic–inorganic structured solid catalysts with different active sites, new efforts should focus on the development of this route to the sustainable production of carbonates.
1.1.3 Other routes for the preparation of cyclic carbonates. 
(a) Direct CO2 carbonylation of diols for the preparation of cyclic carbonates. 
The direct CO2 carbonylation of diols constitutes another attractive and alternative route to produce cyclic carbonates and to mitigate CO2 emissions (Scheme 1). This process also presents great thermodynamic limitations, operating at high CO2 pressure and involves the production of water that induces hydrolysis of carbonates and catalyst deactivation, requiring the use of large amounts of dehydrating agents. Though several works explored the opportunities for homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts such as metal-based complexes, metallic salts, organocatalysts and ionic liquids,97 we have not found reports using zeolites or OMS based catalytic system. Zeolites and OMS based catalysts should offer great opportunities owing to their ability to host different acid/base active sites of the Lewis and Brønsted type that could enable both the carbonylation of diols and the elimination of water via a hydration process such as nitrile, that constitutes a strategy largely adopted to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium.201 In addition, control of the hydrophobic properties of the catalytic surface could be exploited to remove water and prevent deactivation of the active centers.
(b) Reaction of CO2 with propargylic alcohols for the preparation of dialkyl carbonates. 
Reaction of CO2 with propargylic alcohols gives alkylidene cyclic carbonates and constitutes another attractive green route (Scheme 1). Nevertheless, no reported investigations using ordered microporous or mesoporous based catalytic systems were found up to our knowledge. This process present thermodynamic limitations and requires harsh reaction conditions (temperature and pressure) and the use of metal-based catalysts.202


1.2 Synthesis of dialkyl carbonates. 
1.2.1 Introduction. 
Dialkyl carbonates play an important role in our daily life and among them the most important short-chain dialkyl carbonates are diethyl (DEC) and dimethyl carbonates (DMC). The numerous properties of dialkyl carbonates such as polarity, good biodegradability, low toxicity and reactivity make them important chemical materials to produce polycarbonates, chemical intermediates, fuel additives and solvents for coating, adhesives and for batteries.90,91,203,204 Dialkyl carbonates can be prepared by different phosgene free synthetic routes such as alcoholysis of urea, oxidative carbonylation of alcohols or transesterification of cyclic or dialkyl carbonates. The interests and economic viability of each route vary in function of local resources, environmental standpoint, value and application of the dialkyl carbonates. The direct carbonylation of alcohols by reacting CO2 with two equivalents of an alcohol to yield linear carbonates and water as the sole side-product, constitutes a valuable and attractive alternative. This direct synthesis pathway offers a green and sustainable approach to prepare linear carbonates but is very challenging because of the need to activate CO2, the unfavourable thermodynamics of the reversible process, the deactivation of the catalysts, and the hydrolysis of dialkyl carbonates formed due to the concomitant formation of water (Scheme 33). Thus, the development of effective catalytic system requires the combination of an efficient and recyclable catalyst with a dehydration system. Indirect synthesis of dialkyl carbonates from CO2 can also be carried out starting from urea produced at a large scale from CO2. The production of dialkyl carbonates directly from CO2 requires both the activation of alcohol and the formation of alkyl species and activation of CO2 molecules preferably over acidic and basics sites, respectively. A possible mechanism is proposed in Scheme 34 adapted from proposed mechanisms reported by Arbelaez et al.205 and Bian et al.205 In the past decades, numerous catalysts for the preparation of dialkyl carbonates such as Sn,206 Ti207 and Nb,208 metal oxides (Ce, Zr, Cu, and Fe)209–213 and heteropolyoxometalate catalysts214,215 have been studied. Although, numerous investigations focused on the synthesis of short-chain dialkyl carbonate from CO2 in the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, but the numerous limitations of yields, corrosion, work-up conditions and low catalyst recyclability are still the bottlenecks of the process. The transesterification of cyclic and short-chain dialkyl carbonate constitutes a mature alternative technology to prepare more specific and long chain carbonates. Reported studies of DEC synthesis in the presence of Li, Cs, Na or K carbonates at 100 °C and 5 MPa stated DEC yields of up to 1.4%.216 In the presence of oxides and mixtures, maximum 0.62% DEC yield in the presence of CeO2212 at 140 °C and 5 MPa or 3.2% DEC yield in the presence of ZrO2/SiO2217 at 150 °C and 20 MPa were reported. In the presence of alkoxide (MeOK), maximum 16.2% DEC yield at 80 °C and 7.3 MPa was reported.218 These data show that the preparation of dialkyl carbonate is not an easy task and that the design of new efficient and recyclable catalytic system is very challenging.

 Scheme 34  Possible mechanism for the dialkyl carbonate formation by carbonylation of alcohol with CO2. 
1.2.2 Acid–base OMS-based catalysts for the synthesis of dialkyl carbonates. 
The formation of linear carbonates requires both the activation of CO2 and methanol molecules and ideally requires the presence of both acidic and basic sites. Therefore, the design of efficient and recyclable catalyst has been based on this acid–base catalytic mechanism. Metal oxides have therefore been intensively explored as catalysts for the preparation of dialkyl carbonates since they offer the possibility of combining the presence of both acid and basic active sites on the catalytic surface with tunable strength, dispersion and structure. Also, the synergetic effect between acidic and basic sites can be provided by amphiprotic oxides.209 Therefore, different oxides mixtures (CeO2, ZrO2) have been employed.210,219–221 As aforementioned, the basicity in zeolite and ordered mesoporous material is associated with the presence of framework oxygen atoms, Lewis basic sites, and their strength is related to the density of negative charge. Therefore, the basicity or the negative charge on oxygen atom, is a function of framework atoms, the extra-framework cations nature and the structure. To modify and enhance the basic properties different approaches can be followed such as the occlusion in the pore system of alkali metal clusters and oxide/hydroxide particles, or the modification of the intrinsic basicity of the framework oxygen, varying the cation framework or by cation-exchange of the extra-framework cations, suitably using low electronegativity cations such as alkali metal cations.41–44 Following these leads, the catalytic performance of solid base materials, CeO2 or exchanged alkali metal MCM-41 and Na-ZSM-12, Cs-ZSM-12 zeolites were investigated for the synthesis of diethyl carbonate in the presence of butylene oxide as a dehydrating agent. It could be expected that the high internal surface area of MCM-41 enabled high dispersion of CeO2 providing a higher density of basic sites. Moreover, the local environment of the exchanged alkali metal and the pore structure influenced the catalytic properties and accessibility to the active sites. At 170 °C and 4.5 MPa CO2 pressure, low yield and selectivity to diethyl carbonate (DEC) were achieved. The higher DEC formation was obtained in the presence 16 wt% Ce–H-MCM-41 and 32 wt% Ce–Si-MCM-41 and attributed to the presence of weak and strong basic sites while no DEC was observed in the presence of the alkali metal exchanged materials.222
CeO2 has been widely explored for CO2 conversion due to its suitable properties to activate CO2 molecules.223–228 Thus, numerous works have reported the high potential of CeO2 for the direct synthesis of dialkyl and cyclic carbonates.219,228,229 However, the main limitations of CeO2 is its easy deactivation by water, therefore the control of hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of the catalytic surface can play a key role. Accordingly, the hydrophobicity of Ce/SBA-15 catalysts was varied by silylation of OH group with hexamethyldisilazane.230 The catalytic behavior of the silylated samples revealed that the catalytic activity was related to the amount of moderate acid sites enabling the activation of methanol and to the hydrophobicity that allowed reducing the deactivation by water adsorption. Then, hydrophobic catalysts exhibited higher activity than hydrophilic samples. The highest 0.2% DMC yield close to equilibrium value was obtained in the presence of Ce/SBA-15–6 hydrophobic catalyst at 130 °C, 12 h and 12 MPa.
1.2.3 Zeolite-based catalysts for the synthesis of dialkyl carbonates. 
In order to shift the equilibrium of the process, the effectiveness of different strategic organic and inorganic dehydrating agents have been reported such as ketals,231 orthoesters,232 and epoxides,233 molecular sieves.234 Among them ketals present different advantages such as price, availability, harmless and chemical neutrality. Alcohol and ketone react to produce a ketal and water which reversibly give back alcohol and ketone. During the dialkyl carbonate formation, advantage of the production of water could be taken to hydrolyze the acetal and produce alcohols and ketones. Accordingly, the efficient combination of CeO2 and H-FAU as a solid and recyclable catalyst to perform direct diethyl carbonate (DEC) synthesis from CO2 and ethanol in the presence of DEP (2,2-dimethoxy propane) as a dehydrating agent was described. Different zeolites with similar and optimized Si/Al close to 25 were checked but higher DEC yield and selectivity were achieved in the presence of the FAU zeolite. Therefore, a 62% high DEC yield based on DEP was obtained at 120 °C and 6.5 MPa CO2 after 24 h of reaction. Moreover, the stability of the catalytic system was shown over 4 cycles.235 Previously, the catalytic data of the DEC synthesis in the presence of ZrO2 as catalyst and 3A molecular sieve as co-catalyst showed the improved DEC yield, about 2.5-fold, induced by the presence of molecular sieve. In optimized reaction conditions, 150 °C and 7 MPa and ZrO2/3A ratio of 5:2, 0.384 mmol DEC yield was obtained after 2 h with 85% selectivity.
1.2.4 Conclusions. 
The direct synthesis of dialkyl carbonates is a difficult task due to the thermodynamics and the reversibility of the process. Moreover, the production of water constitutes another limitation and induces a rapid deactivation of the catalysts and hydrolysis of the carbonates. Very few attempts to design and develop heterogeneous catalytic systems have been investigated and this remains a topic to be explored. Zeolites and ordered mesopore-based catalysts, due to their versatility in accommodating different types of active sites and the possibility to control their hydrophobic properties, should be good candidates to develop active and efficient catalysts to activate both CO2 and ROH molecules and remove water through chemical transformation or rapid desorption from the catalytic surface. Moreover, the development of knowledge and insights into the elucidation of catalytic species, intermediates and substrates through theoretical calculations, characterization and modeling studies should be of great value to rationalize experimental data and design new efficient and recyclable catalysts.

2 Synthesis of carbamates
Organic carbamates are an important class of chemicals that find applications in a variety of polymers (polyurethanes), agrochemicals,236,237 drugs and medicines,238 and intermediates of fine and commodity chemicals.239–241 The carbamate group features a particular stability due to the delocalization of the non-bonding electrons on the N-atom into the carboxyl moiety. This specific stability allows improving the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs and that is the reason for the presence of this functional group in many pharmaceuticals (Fig. 12).242–244 As such, more than 10000 tons of carbamates per year are used in the agriculture.245 The production of carbamates currently proceeds through the alcoholysis of isocyanates or aminolysis of chloroformates,246–248 because the preparation of isocyanates and chloroformates are originated from highly toxic and corrosive phosgene.249,250 Thus the use of anthropogenic CO2 as the C1 source for the preparation of carbamates is very topical and numerous works have been reported.251,252 Different approaches have been attempted for the production of carbamates from CO2 and amines, and different substrates such as alcohols, metal alkoxide, epoxide and alkyl halides. Nevertheless, several limitations as high CO2 pressure, long reaction times, use of homogeneous catalysts, low yields and limited scope need to be improved for a successful application. Thus, the rational design and development of efficient and recyclable heterogeneous catalysts for the synthesis of carbamates from CO2 is still topical.

2.1 Synthesis of acyclic carbamates. 
2.1.1 Introduction. 
As aforementioned, in the literature different pathways using CO2 as the carboxyl moiety for the preparation of acyclic carbamates have been widely studied (Scheme 35). Nevertheless, the synthesis of acyclic carbamates presents thermodynamic limitations and harsh reaction conditions are generally required. Numerous catalytic systems such as metal-based catalysts (Al, Sn, Ru, Zn, and Fe),253–255 base (DBU)241,256,257 and alkali metal salts have been described for the preparation of carbamates (Scheme 35).258,259 However, few attempts involved the use of ordered microporous and mesoporous based catalysts as catalysts or as support, and only the synthesis of acyclic carbamates following the three components coupling of amine, RX and CO2 pathway has been described in the presence of these types of materials.
 Scheme 35  Synthesis pathways of acyclic carbamates. 
2.1.2 Three component coupling of amine, RX and CO2 for the synthesis of carbamates. 
Among the different possible pathways, oxidative carbonylation of amine represents a sustainable and eco-friendly pathway for producing organic carbamates (R1NHCO2R2) from CO2 (Scheme 36). The reaction of CO2 and amine provides a carbamate anion which, after reaction with an alkyl halide, yields a carbamate. In the absence of a catalyst, the amine alkylation also occurs and constitutes the main side product. To minimize undesired reaction, different catalysts have been used such as base catalysts (DBU, alkali metal salts),260–264 alkyl-onium salts265,266 and metal based catalysts (Pd, Zn).263,267 In the literature, only few examples describing the use of OMS based catalysts was reported.
 Scheme 36  Oxidative carbonylation of amine in the presence of alkyl halides. 
(a) Zeolite-based catalysts for the three component coupling of amine, RX and CO2. 
Zeolite-beta synthesized with tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) as the structure directing agent (SDA) was used as a catalyst for the synthesis of aryl carbamates by oxidative carbonylation of amines with CO2.268 Aliphatic and aromatic carbamates were obtained with high selectivity 84–95% without solvent requirement, at 80 °C and 0.34 MPa CO2 pressure (Table 2, entries 1–6). The order of reactivity with amines was the following: octylamine > cyclohexylamine > hexylamine > benzylamine > aniline > 2,4,6-trimethyl aniline, the reactivity of aliphatic amines being higher than that of aromatic amines. Previously, the same group reported the catalytic performance of different titanosilicate molecular sieves (TS-1, Ti-MCM-41, Ti-SBA-15) and metal phthalocyanine complexes encapsulated in zeolite-Y for the synthesis of carbamates.268,269 Alkyl and aryl carbamates were synthesized with high yields >80% in the presence of TS-1, and in the case of bulky substrates like 2,4,6-trimethylaniline and cyclododecylamine, the mesoporous Ti-SBA-15 was more active than TS-1, at 80 °C and 0.34 MPa CO2 pressure (Table 2, entries 7–13). Similarly, metal phthalocyanines encapsulated in Y zeolite exhibited efficient catalytic activity under the same reaction conditions, and butyl-N-phenyl carbamate was prepared with 75% yield. Likewise, the same group described the catalytic performance of an organo-functionalized mesoporous titanosilicate (SBA-15) with the adenine group for the formation of carbonates and carbamates using CO2 as the raw material.207 The presence of both, titanium ions (weak Lewis acid sites) and the amine moieties (the basic sites), was required to maximize the carbamate yield. Aliphatic and aromatic carbamates were prepared with high selectivity (84–85%), even without the solvent, the aliphatic amines being more reactive (Table 2, entries 14–19). However, the main drawback of these methodologies is the need for a strong donor solvent like DMF.

(b) Ordered mesoporous based catalysts for the three component coupling of amine, RX and CO2. 
The synthesis and catalytic activity of an as-synthesized form of MCM-41 with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as SDA for the production of carbamates was also described.177 The coupling reaction of CO2, n-butyl-bromide and N-alkyl and N-aryl amines was performed with high selectivity and without solvent at 80 °C and 0.34 MPa CO2 pressure, nevertheless, recyclability of the MCM-41 catalyst was not explored (Table 2, entries 20–25). The catalytic activity of the same materials was also reported for the synthesis of cyclic carbonates.
(c) Conclusions. 
The syntheses of acyclic carbamates have been scarcely investigated in the presence of zeolites and OMS based catalysts although good yield and selectivity were reached. The recyclability of the catalysts should be further explored and reaction conditions improved for achieving potential application. This process generally requires highly active and selective homogeneous organometallic complexes and strong bases, and it is of interest to find heterogeneous alternatives. Today, it is still difficult to transfer the remarkable catalytic activity of homogeneous organometallic complexes to solid catalysts. Nevertheless, recent developments in the rational design of solid catalysts with well defined single or multiple active sites, can help in the synthesis of tailor made hybrid organic–inorganic structured materials containing one or the two required catalytic functions. This last could be a good direction in the achievement of more successful solid catalysts for the synthesis of acyclic carbamates.


2.2 Synthesis of 2-oxazolidinones. 
2.2.1 Introduction. 
Oxazolidinones are heterocyclic compounds containing N and O in a 5-member ring with a wide scope of applications in chemical synthesis for the production of chiral auxiliaries,270 agrochemicals271 and pharmaceuticals, such as antidepressants272 and antitumor drugs.273 Moreover, 2-oxazolidinones represent a novel class of synthetic antimicrobial agents exhibiting a potent activity against Gram-positive organisms.274–277 Besides, 2-oxazolidinones have found application as a solvent for lithium-ion batteries278 and ink-jet printing.279
Classically, 2-oxazolidinones are prepared from aminoalcohols and carbonyl group sources such as phosgene, carbonate and isocyanate.280,281 The other important route of synthesis involves the reaction of epoxides with isocyanates.282,283 As was mentioned above, alternatives to the use of reactant issue from phosgene and phosgene are of great interest to avoid its toxicity, the associated production of corrosive salts and hazardous storage and handling. Therefore, the use of CO2 is an environmentally friendly promising and challengeable alternative to the use of toxic, harmful and costly substrates.284,285 In the last two decades, a series of CO2 fixation pathways for the preparation of functionalized 2-oxazolidinones, such as cycloaddition of CO2 with aziridines,284 CO2 fixation through cyclisation with unsaturated compounds such as propargylamines,284,286 allylic and α-allenylic amines,287 and coupling of propargylic alcohols, amines and CO2,285 dehydrative condensation of β-amino alcohols284,288,289 and condensation with epoxyamine have been explored (Scheme 37).
 Scheme 37  CO2 fixation pathways to the production of substituted 2-oxazolidinones. 
Works have been published on different synthetic routes to fix anthropogenic CO2 into 2-oxazolidinones in the presence of organometallic complexes, metal salts, organocatalysts (ionic liquid, quaternary ammonium, phosphine and bases). Attempts for heterogenisation290–294 of organocatalysts and organometallic complexes were explored as well as the possibilities of MOFs as catalysts.295,296 Nevertheless, the use of ordered micro and mesoporous materials has been almost unexplored.
2.2.2 Cycloaddition of CO2 with aziridine. 
The cycloaddition of CO2 with aziridine constitutes an important route to mitigate the excess emissions while preparing high value-added chemicals (Scheme 37) through the chemical fixation of CO2 with 100% atom efficiency. Numerous studies have focused on the synthesis and reactivity of aziridines since they are an important tool in organic chemistry owing to the high reactivity of the ring-strain that at the same time makes them unstable.297 The cycloaddition proceeds in three steps: the first and limiting step is the ring opening of N-heterocycle through nucleophilic attack, followed by the attack of the formed zwitterion to CO2 molecule to provide a carbamate. The last step is the intramolecular cyclization via a nucleophilic attack (Scheme 38).
 Scheme 38  Common cycloaddition mechanism between aziridine and CO2 under aziridine ring activation and nucleophilic attack. 
Though a large variety of homogeneous catalysts exhibited high catalytic performance for cycloaddition, such as ionic liquids,298,299 alkali metal salts,300–303 quaternary ammonium,304 metal salts305 and metal complexes,306–308 these catalytic systems usually operate under harsh reaction conditions (high temperature and pressure). In addition to the main disadvantages of homogeneous catalysts such as non-recyclability, production of wastes, the described synthesis routes commonly involve expensive catalysts and limited substrate scope.309 Very few works using OMS-based materials were reported and none zeolites-based. Cycloaddition of CO2 with aziridine in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts is an underdeveloped synthesis route, worth to be thoroughly explored.
Due to their properties such as large pore size and high surface area, ordered mesoporous materials offer numerous possibilities to support and immobilize homogeneous catalysts. Recently, amine functionalized MCM-41 catalyst were prepared and used for the synthesis of oxazolidinones, expecting that hydrogen bonding of primary amine groups with nitrogen atom of aziridines could accelerate the ring opening of aziridines.310 The hybrid catalyst exhibited high catalytic activity for the synthesis of numerous 5-aryl-2-oxazolidinones with high yield up to 98%, at 40–80 °C and high 5 MPa CO2 pressure. Moreover, the catalyst showed high stability and recyclability. The yield of 3-butyl-5-phenyloxazolidin-2-one was maintained for five consecutive recycles. A mechanism via zwitterions was described. The nucleophilic attack of the carbamate ion lead to the main product of the reaction derived from ring-opening of the aziridine at the hindered carbon (5-substituted oxazolidinone) (Table 3, entries 1–7).

Previously, an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) functionalized MCM-41 was synthesized and used as catalyst for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides and aziridines (Scheme 39). The authors showed that the NHC–CO2 adduct was the catalytic active species. Different oxazolidinones were obtained with excellent yield and regioselectivity, under mild reactions conditions, 100 °C and 2 MPa CO2 pressure (Table 3, entries 8–11).311

2.3 Conclusion. 
Several investigations have focused on substituting toxic carbonylating agents by inexpensive, nontoxic and accessible CO2. Nevertheless, due to the CO2 inertness, the CO2 fixation to produce 2-oxazolidines is a difficult task and several limitations such as moderate yields and selectivity, the use of large amounts of homogeneous catalysts and harsh reaction conditions constitute impediments for the high-scale production. Therefore, the design and development of efficient, selective, recyclable and economic catalysts is still challenging. Today, we have knowledge and tools for the rational design of micro and mesoporous materials that can act as molecular sieves for reactant selection, while containing well-isolated single or multiple active sites accommodated on the zeolite walls, and so accessible to reactants through their diffusion. From there, materials could be developed with regular pores and cavities, even by “ab initio” synthesis312 that can control the reactant adsorption and transition-state stabilization and supplying the desired process selectivity.313 Besides, kinetic, theoretical and modelling studies, are still required to a rational design of the catalysts. Then, owing to their robustness, versatility in their possibilities of functionalization, and zeolite and OMS-based catalytic systems containing multi-active centers for activation of CO2 molecules and others components of the different CO2 fixation pathways may offer opportunities worth being explored for the production of carbamates.

3 Other formation of C–N bond
The use of CO2 as C1 building block is of great interest, and as aforementioned the main disadvantage is thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of CO2. The use of high-energy substrate such as epoxide and aziridine constitutes an effective strategy for the fixation of CO2, and among the active substrates, amines are good candidates for the formation of new C–N bond.252,314,315 Important examples are the synthesis of urea, carbamates or oxazolidinones and polyurethanes.
Quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione constitutes an important class of nitrogen-containing heterocycles with biological activities that find a large number of applications as pharmaceuticals.316–319 The synthesis of quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione derivatives starting from non-toxic, low cost and readily available substrates such as CO2 and 2-aminobenzonitrile is of great interest and constitutes an environmentally friendly process with 100% atom efficiency and an alternative route to the use of toxic phosgene, carbamates,320 anthranilic acids with urea,321,322 potassium cyanate and chlorosulfonyl isocyanate.319 A new, straightforward and overall green synthetic route of quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione in the presence of DBU has been reported. In the presence of a base catalyst, the formation of quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione involves the nucleophilic attack of the amino group on CO2. After cyclization, aperture and new cyclization, quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione is produced (Scheme 40).
 Scheme 40  Synthesis of quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione by carbonylation of 2-aminobenzonitrile and CO2. 
The use of CO2 and 2-aminobenzonitrile in the preparation of quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione is a recent synthesis pathway and has to be further explored. In fact, we have found two references using ordered micro or mesoporous materials. Recently, mesoporous basic zeolite for various transformations involving large organic molecules have been synthesized154 and functionalized with primary, secondary, and tertiary amines via a post-synthetic method via covalent bonding. Accordingly, nanocrystalline zeolite (Nano-ZSM-5) functionalized with basic ionic liquids was used for the quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione synthesis. Under optimized reaction conditions, 150 °C, 12 h, in protic solvent (DMF), selected CO2 pressure (3.5 MPa), 93.6% yield was achieved.166 The same group previously reported the use of covalent amine (3-(2-(2-aminoethylamino) ethylamino) propyltrimethoxysilane, AEPTMS) functionalized MCM-41, as an efficient and recyclable catalyst for the synthesis of a variety of quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione compounds from substituted 2-aminobenzonitriles and CO2 in water.323 Solvent played a fundamental role and highly polar solvents were adequate for achieving high yield, the best yields being achieved in DMF and water. Under optimized reaction conditions, at 130 °C, 18 h and 3.5 MPa CO2 pressure, 91% quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-dione yield was achieved. The successful scope of the catalyst, as well as the possibility of reusing the catalyst for five consecutive recycles was shown for various substrates.
4 Synthesis of carboxylic acid

4.1 Carboxylation reaction via CO2 insertion into the C–M bond for the synthesis of carboxylic acid. 
Carboxylic acids constitutes an important class of commodity chemicals with numerous applications as solvents, intermediates for pharmaceuticals, flavors and fragrances and monomers for polymer productions. Carboxylic acid is usually prepared by oxidation of hydrocarbons with the exception of acetic acid that are issued from carbonylation of methanol.
The production of carboxylic acid from CO2 insertion into the C–H bond is a green and atom economic reaction. Nevertheless, this reaction is thermodynamically unfavourable, being both endothermic and entropically disfavoured. Thus, this transformation is very challenging and the design and preparation of new catalysts to overcome this kinetic barrier is of great interest. Then, the preparation of carboxylic acids via carboxylation of alkanes by insertion of CO2 into a C-metal bond is still at an early stage and offers numerous research opportunities.


4.2 Synthesis of acetic acid. 
4.2.1 Introduction. 
Acetic acid is an important raw material in the chemical industry for the production of vinyl acetate and acetic anhydride. Acetic acid is produced by fermentation and chemical routes. Every year, 7 Mt of acetic acid are produced and 190 kt are issued from fermentation. Carbonylation of methanol, oxidation of aldehyde and oxidation of ethylene are the main chemical pathways, while the direct conversion of CO2 and CH4 to produce acetic acid is an attractive route to mitigate global warming and emission of greenhouse gases (Scheme 41). Using two gases with greenhouse effects, this route of acetic acid synthesis is considered green and represents an atom economical reaction. Nevertheless, the inertness of both molecules CH4 and CO2 makes this conversion very difficult and thermodynamically limited. Calculation of Gibbs energy showed an increase, ΔG = 71.17 kJ mol−1,324 and, the development of an efficient catalyst to overcome the kinetic barrier constitutes a great challenge.
 Scheme 41  Direct synthesis of acetic acid from CO2 and methane. 
Many heterogeneous catalytic systems have been developed such as Cu/Co supported on oxide,325 Pd and Pt on carbon or alumnina,326 Pd or Rh on silica.327 Nevertheless, up to now these catalysts have exhibited poor selectivity, low acetic acid yield and turnover frequency, and operate at high temperature, >425 °C.
4.2.2 Zeolite based catalysts for acetic acid synthesis. 
(a) Zeolite-based catalysts containing Cu and Fe for acetic acid synthesis. 
Recently, zeolites, especially metal ion-modulated zeolites, were found to be highly active in the dissociation of the C–H bond328 of methane and the C–C coupling between the methyl group (–CH3) and CO2.329 Accordingly, numerous studies have focused on the activation of CH4 molecules in metal exchanged zeolites.330,331 Naturally, CH4 is converted into methanol by the methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzymes using Cu and Fe as active metals. Two forms of monooxygenase exist, cytoplasmic (soluble) and membrane-bound (particulate) with different active sites, a bis(m-oxo)diiron332 and Cu cluster,333,334 respectively, the latter catalyzing the oxygen insertion into the C–H methane bond. Different studies attributed the catalytic activity to a Cu dimer334 or to a trinuclear Cu cluster.335
Accordingly, numerous catalytic systems based on iron and copper–oxygen species in inorganic matrices were studied for methane oxidation. One of the most promising catalysts is the copper and iron exchanged zeolites. Following these leads, different catalytic systems were designed and explored to determine the nature of active Cu-clusters for the conversion of CH4 into methanol. Recently,336 a study of cationic species in Cu-MOR materials showed that, in contrast to other metal-modulated zeolites337,338 where different cationic species are present, in Cu-MOR only homogeneous single sites are anchored. Trinuclear Cu-oxo clusters, [Cu3(μ-O)3]2+, anchored to two framework Al atoms located at the pore mouth of the 8-MR side pockets were well described. Moreover, these trinuclear Cu-oxo clusters were shown to be highly stable under dry conditions. The C–H bond activation of methane molecules to methanol production has been the objective of many studies. Despite the efforts and numerous works, the nature of the active sites and the mechanism of activation of both CH4 and CO2 molecules and their conversion into acetic acid on metal modulated zeolites are still the subject of numerous discussions and studies. A general mechanism of bifunctional activation with the formation of metal methyl species and CO2 protonation is favoured and depicted in the Scheme 42.329,339,340
 Scheme 42  Possible scheme for direct conversion of CH4 and CO2 over metal-modulated zeolite. 
Modelling studies have been most useful for a deeper understanding of the catalysis of metal-modulated zeolites for the direct conversion of CH4 and CO2. A recent theoretical study over Cu-modulated BEA, MFI, MOR and TON zeolites was performed by means of DFT calculations. The results showed that the catalytic activity of Cu-modulated zeolites is closely related to the structure of both active copper species and zeolite pore channels. The isomorphic substitution of the Si atom with the Al atom in the zeolite framework induces a negative charge that is compensated by mononuclear [Cu]2+, binuclear [CuOCu]2+, or trinuclear [Cu3(μ-O)3]2+ clusters.341 The study showed that under specific catalyst activation conditions, different Cu-cationic species can be preferentially stabilized in the corresponding optimized structures. The authors showed that [CuOCu]2+ is preferentially stabilized in the three-dimensional BEA and MFI zeolites while [Cu3(μ-O)3]2+ is preferentially stabilized in the one-dimensional MOR and TON zeolites. Experimental data reported in the bibliography also indicated that binuclear [CuOCu]2+ in the MFI zeolite342 exhibited high activity, while trinuclear [Cu3(μ-O)3]2+ was the dominant active sites in the MOR zeolite.343 Zeolites incorporating [CuOCu]2+ and [Cu3(μ-O)3]2+ species showed to be active for the direct conversion of CH4 and CO2, in comparison with the mononuclear copper ([Cu]2+) species. Specifically, the authors claimed that [CuOCu]2+ in the MFI and BEA zeolites are suitable to stabilize the transition state of the rate-determining C–C coupling by electrostatic forces and reduce the free energy and enthalpy barrier. On the other hand, the authors claimed the ability of [Cu3(μ-O)3]2+ present in the MOR zeolite to stabilize the transition state of the C–C coupling (Fig. 13). The differences in stabilization ability, resulted in a higher catalytic activity with a low apparent activation energy (57 kJ mol−1) in the MOR zeolite with [Cu3(μ-O)3]2+ clusters.

In an experimental study in continuous fixed-bed reactor using Cu-exchanged M-ZSM-5 (M = Li+, Na+, K+ and Ca++), a synergetic effect between metallic Cu species and the basic cations was suggested to allow the simultaneous activation of CH4 and CO2 molecules to form acetic acid.329 The nature of the metallic Cu species was not discussed, and previous reduction of the catalyst was carried out before its use to prevent the formation of CuOx. The results showed that the CO2 activation was dependent on the alkali cations, favouring the CO2 insertion into C–H activated bond of CH4. Cationic properties such as size (Li < Na < K) and cation charge control both charge density and number of cations. Cu–Ca-ZSM5 exhibited the lowest activity. Adsorption studies revealed the higher CO2 adsorption capacity of Cu–K-ZSM5, attributed to the acid–base interaction between the ZSM-5 framework and CO2 molecules. Cu–Na-ZSM-5 catalyst gave the highest rate of acetic acid formation at the initial period but showed a higher deactivation after 1 h than Cu–K-ZSM-5. At 9 min of TOS, 18% of CH4 conversion and acetic acid yield can be achieved, at 500 °C in the presence of the Cu–Na-ZSM-5 catalyst. However, after 1 h, 0.6 and 0.15% of CH4 conversion and acetic acid yield, respectively, were obtained. The best acetic acid production (0.395 mmol gcat−1 h−1) was registered on the Cu–K-ZSM-5 catalyst, at 500 °C, for 10 h. The recyclability of the catalyst was shown and the regenerated catalysts exhibited similar activities to the fresh catalysts (close to 70% acetic acid). The deactivation was mainly due to Cu0 aggregation that could be re-dispersed via a calcination process.
Another theoretical study explored the effect of the metal cations within the zeolite for the direct conversion of CO2 and CH4 to acetic acid. The analysis and comparison of the catalytic properties of MFI zeolites exchanged with Be, Co, Cu, Mg, Mn and Zn cations to compensate the charge induced by the substitution of two Al atoms, was addressed.344 The location of the exchanged metal was within the six-member ring located at the surface of the straight channel. The calculation results showed CH4 dissociation is the rate-determining step, and CH4 dissociation and the free energy barriers of CH4 dissociation and C–C bond coupling were related to the electronegativity of the metal cation. Therefore, the lowest apparent activation energy of 11.5 kcal mol−1 was obtained over the Cu-MFI. Additionally, the authors showed that the co-adsorption of H2O allowed to reduce the acetic acid desorption energy which can be reduced from 42.0 to 20.5 kcal mol−1.
(b) Zeolite based catalysts containing Zn for acetic acid synthesis. 
Numerous investigations on the activation of C–H bond, for methanol or acetic acid production have reported the effect of the local structure of the active sites. Following this, the activity of Zn modified H-ZSM-5 containing isolated Zn2+ cations or small ZnO clusters was studied by means of DFT.340 The conversion of CH4 and CO2 revealed to be strongly dependent on the local structure of the active sites. Thus, Zn2+ cations located in the 5-membered rings of the sinusoidal and straight channels exhibited the best catalytic activity, higher than other Zn2+ cations or small ZnO clusters owing to suitable adsorption properties of CH4 and CO2 and favourable activation energies. Previously, a work based on solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, reported the direct conversion of CH4 and CO2 into acetic acid on zinc-modified H-ZSM-5 (Zn/H-ZSM-5), at low temperature (250–500 °C), and described the reaction mechanism.345 The nature of Zn species was not discussed but the efficient activity and selectivity of the bifunctional zeolite was shown. As was proposed,346,347 the selective formation of methyl-metal species from methane was confirmed (zinc methyl species (–Zn–CH3)) with the simultaneously formation of protons. This mechanism can be well accepted in analogy to the activity of organozinc compounds.348 The adsorption of CO2 on the surface provides a reservoir for CO2 to be inserted into the Zn–C bond. Finally, the zeolite framework offers excellent ability to stabilize and transfer Brønsted protons and to protonate the surface acetate species (Fig. 14).
 Fig. 14  Mechanism to the activation of CH4 and the formation of zinc methyl species and Brønsted proton, while CO2 activation led to the formation of carbonate species (Steps 1 and 2). The insertion of CO2 into zinc methyl species provided surface acetate species that produced acetic acid upon protonation with the restoration of Zn/H-ZSM-5 catalyst (Steps 1 and 2). Reprinted with permission from ref. 345. Copyright 2013, American Chemical Society. 
Currently, it is well accepted that the catalytic activity is determined by the structure and nature of the active sites. The results of adsorption energies for zinc-modified H-ZSM-5 catalysts showed that adsorption strength of CH4 was dependent on Zn2+ cation location and decreased in the following order for the four-, five-, and six-membered rings in straight and sinusoidal channels, Z4 > Z5 > Z6 and M5 > M6, respectively, accordingly to the charge distribution of Zn/H-ZSM-5 based on the Mulliken charge analysis. Consequently, Zn2+ cations located in the 5-membered rings of the channels (straight and sinusoidal) exhibited better catalytic activity than other isolated Zn2+ sites and small ZnO clusters due to the favourable adsorption properties of reactants and activation energies.340
(c) Zeolite-based catalysts containing Au for acetic acid synthesis. 
The possible reaction mechanism for the direct formation of acetic acid from CH4 and CO2 over the Au-exchanged ZSM-5A has been explored by DFT study, involving Brønsted acid sites to the CO2 protonation and Au(I) active center to the formation methyl-gold species.339 The formation of methyl-gold species go through the CH4 molecule activation over the Au(I) active center in which the C–H dissociation proceed via the homolytic σ-bond activation, the calculated energy barrier for methane dissociation on Au-ZSM-5 being only 10.5 kcal mol−1. The methyl-gold species are very stable and the CO2 insertion difficult, 52.9 kcal mol−1 being the activation energy of the concerted mechanism (Fig. 15). The understanding of acetic acid formation over exchanged zeolites is a valuable contribution in the path to the design of more efficient catalysts.

4.2.3 Conclusions. 
The reported works provide relevant and crucial insights about the mechanism of the direct conversion of CO2 and CH4 into acetic acid within the pores of microporous materials, the limiting step and barrier energies that catalytic systems must overcome. The structure and composition of the zeolite framework stabilize extraframework metal species that are able to activate methane and form methyl-metal species. Up to now, among the few reported experimental data, the best results were achieved in the presence of Cu–K-ZSM-5 catalyst with 0.395 mmol gcat−1 h−1 acetic acid production, at 500 °C, for 10 h.329 The synthesis of an efficient catalyst with active sites for the simultaneous activation of CH4 activation and CO2 insertion remains crucial and challenging. Thus, the catalyst based on zeolite or OMS should have metal active sites for CH4 activation, adequate CO2 adsorption capacity and CO2 insertion activity that will be achieved by the incorporation of Lewis acid sites, basic sites and oxygen vacancies. So far, important insights have been made using both experimental and theoretical approaches. However, systemic study and understanding of reaction mechanisms, determination of reaction intermediates and catalyst active species by computational studies and in situ characterization are imperative. Furthermore, a performing reaction system should be designed to overcome the limitations of thermodynamic equilibrium and improve the production of acetic acid. In addition, a reaction system using plasma could offer new opportunities.


4.3 Synthesis of propanoic acid. 
Propanoic acid finds wide application as an intermediate in the synthesis of commodity chemicals and polymers, and used as a preservative in food. Propanoic acid is mainly produced by hydrocarboxylation of ethylene in the presence of Pd(AcO)2349 and could be ideally prepared from the insertion of CO2 into ethane (Scheme 43). To overcome thermodynamic limitations the design and preparation of new catalysts is a great challenge. Very few references are reported in the bibliography concerning the preparation of propanoic acid from CO2.
 Scheme 43  Direct synthesis of propanoic acid from CO2 and ethane. 
In analogy with the synthesis of acetic acid, metal modulated zeolite can be good candidates to activate CO2 and C–H bond to allow the insertion of CO2 into ethane. In this sense, the activation of short chain alkanes and specially ethane over zeolites has been reported.350,351 Accordingly, a theoretical study using density functional theory (DFT) has recently investigated possible reaction pathways for the conversion of CO2 and C2H6 to propanoic acid over Au-exchanged MCM-22 zeolite catalyst.352 The insertion of CO2 was envisioned following two different routes. The first one involves only the metal center, the CO2 insertion into the Au-H bond followed by the C–C coupling and the formation of propanoic acid with an activation energy for the rate-determining step of 48.2 kcal mol−1. The second route involves the metal center and framework Brønsted acid sites with the formation of gold ethyl hydride species with the corresponding transfer of hydrogen to the oxygen framework providing the Brønsted-acid site, followed by the protonation of CO2 and the simultaneous C–C coupling. In this second case, the activation energy is 44.2 kcal mol−1 and it is the favoured route, at low temperatures (Scheme 44). The authors estimated that an increase of temperature could be enough to overcome the barrier energy to perform the direct insertion of CO2 into ethane in the presence of Au-exchanged MCM-22.

4.4 Conclusions. 
Carboxylic acids would ideally be produced from the direct reaction of carbon dioxide with alkanes and some studies provide essential data to rationalize the activity and selectivity for the conversion of CO2 and alkanes to carboxylic acids. However, the use of CO2 as a renewable building block for the synthesis of carboxylic acids via green processes is still at an early stage and, despite great scientific interest and advantages, remains a big challenge. Different synthetic routes involving the use of activated substrates, stoichiometric organometallic reagents, reducing agents, salts, with the co-production of large amounts of residues present some achievements but they have significant drawbacks. Undoubtedly, the development of efficient and multifunctional heterogeneous catalysts is crucial. Computational chemistry and in situ spectroscopy should be important tools to provide in-depth knowledge determine the active species and reaction intermediates that will enable the design of new catalysts and processes to achieve environmental and economic goals. Zeolite and OMS will definitely play a crucial role due to their unique tunable properties and their chemical and thermal stability. So far, CO2 fixation in carboxylic acids remains unattainable from an industrial point of view.

5 Hydrogenation of CO2
Hydrogen is a promising fuel but it lacks the energy density required for practical use. Conversion of CO2 and hydrogen into liquid fuels such as methane or methanol, via Power-to-Liquid (PtL) processes, is more desirable from an energy density perspective. Moreover, considering the intermittence of renewable sources to produce H2,353 CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, methane or dimethylether can provide an important approach to store energy. However, a significant improvement in catalyst technology for CO2 conversion is required for carbon capture and utilization to become an economically viable alternative. Hydrogen can be produced from fossil sources such as natural gas and coal, and from water electrolysis using electricity from nuclear plants or from renewable sources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, and hydroelectric power. Therefore, to fulfill the concepts of sustainability and green chemistry and make CO2 hydrogenation a valuable strategy, hydrogen has to be green and produced from non-fossil sources. Currently, different approaches to green H2 production, such as water electrolysis using fuel cells, the biomass thermo-chemical process, anaerobic fermentation and water splitting through photo-electrolysis, are being considered.

5.1 Hydrogenation/reduction of CO2 to formic acid. 
For several CO2 conversions, the enthalpy changes revealed that transformations are exothermic despite the high stability of CO2. Nevertheless, in almost all cases, the Gibbs free energy changes are positive and thermodynamically unfavoured.354–357 Negative Gibbs free energy changes often correspond to the hydrogenation reaction where very stable compounds, such as water, are produced, or to CO2 transformation where C–O bonds are not broken.358 Although CO2 transformations are not thermodynamically favourable, in practice, by working under adequate conditions such as pressure, temperature and ratio of reactants, processes involving CO2 activation and reactions must be possible and of clear interest. Hydrogenation/reduction processes are attractive and valuable processes even if it is still challenging to convert CO2 into platform molecules with high activity and selectivity. If this is achieved and industrially applied, it will impact our daily life, economy, CO2 mitigation, environment and climatic changes.
5.1.1 Introduction. 
Formic acid is the simplest organic acid. It is eco-friendly, noncorrosive, easily biodegradable, and a valuable chemical used as a dye in the textile and leather industries, as an intermediate in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry,359 a green solvent and moreover a promising hydrogen storage component. Reversible processes of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation make possible the hydrogen storage through the formation of formic acid from CO2 hydrogenation, and the decomposition into CO2 and H2 is thermodynamically downhill (Scheme 45).360,361
 Scheme 45  Reversible hydrogen storage. 
The current industrial methods for formic acid production include hydrolysis of methyl formate or formamide, oxidation of biomass359 and the reaction of CO with water.362 All these methods lead to the production of hazardous wastes and high energetic costs. According to the report of Coval Energy, the global annual demand for formic acid was around 870 ktons in 2021 with a forecasted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.87% during the period 2022–2027.363
Direct hydrogenation of CO2 into formic acid is a green and 100% atom economy reaction allowing to mitigate CO2 emissions and to store H2 in a liquid form. CO2 hydrogenation is an important approach to use CO2 to produce C1 chemicals but it is still challenging due to CO2 inertness and stability. Moreover, this conversion is entropically disfavoured since it involves a phase change from gaseous reagents into a liquid product (Scheme 46).
 Scheme 46  Hydrogenation of CO2 into formic acid. 
Significant progress in the development of highly efficient and robust homogeneous catalytic systems, especially Ru362,364 and Ir-based metallic complex requiring the use of a co-catalyst such as phosphines, amines or carbonate salts, has been achieved.365–368 Nevertheless, in spite of their excellent catalytic performance in terms of activity and selectivity369 with TON and TOF of up to 110000 h−1,370 several drawbacks such as toxicity, difficult separation of formic acid or formic acid derivatives and the absence of recyclability of the homogeneous catalysts make it necessary to develop efficient, robust and recyclable catalytic systems.371,372
5.1.2 Zeolite-based catalysts for formic acid synthesis. 
Heterogeneous catalysts have been widely explored for formic acid production from CO2 in the presence of nanoparticulate noble and non-noble metals supported on carbon, metal oxides and silica,373 see for instance, RANEY® nickel in the presence of amines,374 synthesized nanoporous nickel,375 Pd/C,376 and Au/TiO2.377 However, only few works have studied the potential catalytic properties of zeolite based catalysts for this reaction.
Virtual screening is an important tool to avoid or support tedious studies based on experimental trial and error studies. Computational screening is a method that broadly combines computational algorithms for selecting promising candidates from a large library of materials. The combination of the modular building-block approach and the potential for computational screening has allowed the introduction of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) to “discover, develop, and deploy new materials twice as fast”.378 MGI attempts to combine theory, computation, synthesis, and characterization to boost the discovery and synthesis of new materials.379 In agreement, a computational screening of well-known zeolites as great catalysts combining molecular simulation and machine-learning techniques is of much use for advancing synthesis and reactivity380–383 and also for conversion of CO2 into useful products.384 In this study, the combination of adsorption simulations, dual-adsorption models, energy–entropy calculations, and statistical and machine learning modelling techniques allowed establishing structure–property relationships based on structural characteristics (pore size, surface area, and voids) and zeolite performance for the production of methane, methanol, formic acid and formaldehyde. Therefore, promising zeolite candidates were determined to have a cavity size of around 6 Å to maximize the strength of dual-adsorption of hydrogen and CO2. Then, the possible mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid using Lewis acid zeolites has been investigated by using density functional theory (DFT).385 The CO2 hydrogenation and formate ion formation was considered to be the rate-determining step for Sn-ZSM-5 zeolites. The activation barrier was calculated for both perfect (38.2 kcal mol−1) and defect Lewis center (33.0 kcal mol−1). A Sn-ZSM-5 active site allows minimizing the activation energy in comparison to Sn-BEA or Sn-FAU. The order of activation energy for the metal center was determined to be Hf > Zr > Sn > Ge, which is dependent on the charge transfer from the catalytic active site to the reacted molecule. This result showed the importance of charge transfer from the metal to CO2 for the activation of the CO bonds and also the H–H bond breaking via oxygen abstraction at the Sn–OH sites of defect zeolites.
Recent studies showed the good catalytic properties of molecular-sized Ir4 clusters stabilized in FAU and MWW zeolites for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions.51,386,387 Accordingly, a theoretical work reporting the CO2 mechanism to produce formic acid catalyzed by faujasite-supported Ir4 clusters was reported.388 Both hydrogenation of CO2 into CO, thermodynamically favoured, and hydrogenation of CO2 into formic acid, kinetically preferred under water free-conditions, can take place. The important effect of confined water cooperation for both hydrogenation processes was shown. The co-adsorbed water molecule facilitates the H+ transfer step by a water molecule between the zeolite Brønsted acid sites and Ir4 cluster. However, if the formation of the Ir–COOH carboxyl moiety is facilitated by the presence of water this latter also promotes the selective decarbonylation of COOH species and the production of CO. The authors so concluded that it is impossible to obtain formic acid in the presence of water using Ir4/FAU as the catalyst, and that only an effective water-removal and optimized process could ensure the selective formation of formic acid.
5.1.3 OMS-based catalysts for formic acid synthesis. 
The immobilization of homogeneous catalysts via covalent bonding is an alternative to overcome the problems of separation and to improve the environmental impact and costs, by combining the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. This strategy has received a lot of interest for the preparation of formic acid.372,389–391
Following the above direction, MCM-41 functionalized with γ-NH2, CN and SH-propyl trimethoxysilane incorporating RuCl3 were prepared and tested in the hydrogenation of CO2 into formic acid, at 80 °C, 5.4 MPa H2 and 9.3 MPa CO2 (SC) partial pressures, 1 h and in the presence of ethanol as the solvent.392 The importance of the nature and use of a solvent as well as of the ligands showed the influence on the activity of the MCM-41 immobilized ruthenium complex. The three types of MCM-41 immobilized ruthenium complexes exhibited a TON of up to 1022. Nevertheless, the stability of the catalyst was limited. The structured mesoporous material with SH groups showed the best stability but the lowest activity while the material with NH2 groups exhibited lower stability but better activity. The differences in activity and stability were attributed to the complexation ability of the different groups (NH2, CN and SH). More recently, the preparation and catalytic performance of SiO2 and MCM-41 supported Ruthenium materials for the selective hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid, at 80 °C, 40 bar (PH2:PCO2 = 1:2) were reported.393 In terms of TON/TOF values, Ru/MCM-41 exhibited higher catalytic performance than Ru/SiO2 due to its textural properties and large surface area that allow high metal dispersion. Additionally, the catalytic performance of Ru/MCM-41 was improved with the use of sulfated and fluorinated ionic liquid [DAMI][CF3CF2CF2CF2SO3] (DAMI = 1,3-di(N,N -dimethylaminoethyl)-2-methylimidazolium). In this way, the production of formic acid with TON value up to 1780 with Ru/MCM-41 in [DAMI] [CF3CF2CF2CF2SO3] ionic liquid medium and the stability of catalytic properties in the presence of water were demonstrated. The recyclability of the catalyst was shown and Ru/MCM-41 in [DAMI] [CF3CF2CF2CF2SO3] was recycled eight times with practically no loss of activity. This catalytic reaction system offers a green attempt to the production of formic acid and can be used as a leading direction for further developments.
5.1.4 Conclusion. 
This short review of the state-of-the-art related to the use of ordered microporous and mesoporous based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation into formic acid clearly revealed that the potential of these types of materials has been underconsidered despite the requirement of a novel catalytic system for the challenging formic acid production as a hydrogen storage material.
Indeed, the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid is an ideal reaction with 100% atom economy. Nevertheless, at the same time, it is a very challenging task since activating both H2 and CO2 molecules is a hard task, and CO2 hydrogenation to formic acid is thermodynamically unfavored. Moreover, to achieve a higher yield and turnover number, stoichiometric amounts of organic or inorganic bases (DBU, NaOH, KOH, K2CO3, and TEA) are widely used to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium to formate. Note that the present reaction procedure requires further neutralization steps with a stoichiometric amount of acid that produces a high amount of salts and waste, and tedious recovery of formic acid. To achieve environmental and economic goals, a greener and more efficient process is imperative, and heterogeneous catalysts are very valuable, attractive, and prime candidates. Thus, an efficient catalyst will have active centers to adsorb and activate hydrogen (metal species) based on noble metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, and Au) and other metals such as Co, Ni, Cu and Fe, high CO2 adsorption capacity and CO2 activation, which will be achieved by the incorporation of acidic and basic Lewis sites and oxygen vacancies. Undoubtedly, the support will play a key role in adsorbing CO2, and dispersing and stabilizing the different active species. Zeolite and OMS will be major players due to their unique and tunable properties (high surface area, Lewis and Brønsted acid/base properties, and chemical and thermal stability). In addition, a thorough understanding of the reaction mechanism, kinetics and determination of the active species and reaction intermediates will only be possible through computational chemistry and in situ spectroscopy studies, fundamental tools for the design of new catalysts and processes.


5.2 Hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. 
5.2.1 Introduction. 
In the context of H2 and CO2 conversion into liquid fuels via Power-to-Liquid processes, methanol production from CO2 is of much interest. Methanol is a large scale product with an industrial production capacity of about approximately 140 million metric tons in 2018 that is expected to double to reach 280 million metric tons by 2030.394 Industrial production of methanol is from synthesis gas mixtures (H2/CO2/CO) at high pressures (50–100 bar) and temperatures (200–300 °C) over Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts.395 Methanol constitutes an important chemical feedstock and a platform molecule to produce a large variety of bulk commodities396 and fuels397 for engines and fuel cells. Numerous methanol commodity derivatives are produced for their use in our daily life such as paints, polymers, plastics, resins, adhesives, and antifreezes. Taking into account the potential of methanol, George A. Olah and co-workers395 published in 2006 a report of current fossil fuels as energy sources and future alternative sources. There, they discuss the important and future role of methanol and advocated the “methanol economy” whose concept purveys the idea that methanol can be used as an alternative way for storing, transporting and using energy.398

Fig. 16 illustrates the importance of methanol as carbon feedstock obtained from green hydrogenation of CO2 to reach carbon neutrality, and a crucial pathway to reach circularity. One of the most promising route to produce methanol is the direct CO2 hydrogenation. The development of active catalysts and specially zeolite-based catalysts for the conversion of methanol to olefins (MTO),399–403 aromatics, propylene (MTP), dimethyl ether404,405 and fuels406 will play a key role due to the flexibility in their catalytic properties such as the versatility in their composition and the nature of the active sites, robustness, stability and ready availability of zeolites and OMS, and should mark a new breakthrough in the field of molecular sieves.

5.2.2 Thermodynamics for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. 
Methanol is typically synthesized from syngas (H2 + CO) obtained from fossil fuels.371,407 This process is highly exothermic and the major challenge is to control and remove heat excess to shift the equilibrium towards methanol production minimizing side reactions and catalyst sintering. The commercial catalyst generally contains Cu and a mixture of oxides such as ZnO/Al2O3 and operates under relatively “soft” conditions, 210–270 °C and 50–100 bar.408 The main side products are higher alcohols, methane, methyl formate and dimethyl ether. The formation of methanol by direct hydrogenation of CO2 constitutes an alternative and a challenging route. Direct hydrogenation of CO2 competes directly with reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) and the large production of water has a severe negative effect over the catalyst life and the performance of ternary catalyst Cu–ZnO–Al2O3. Moreover, the hydrophilic properties of alumina favour sintering and aggregation of metals. CO produced from RWGS can undergo hydrogenation into methanol (Scheme 47). From thermodynamics standpoint, the enthalpy variation shows that CO and CO2 hydrogenations are exothermic and involve a decrease of volume which indicates that the use of lower reaction temperatures and higher pressures is thermodynamically favourable, while the reverse water-gas-shift reaction is strongly endothermic (Scheme 47). However, a higher temperature favours CO2 activation, while an increase in temperature also promotes the undesirable formation of CO and H2O, limiting CO2 conversion.

5.2.3 Mechanism insights for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. 
A thorough understanding of the reaction mechanism and how the catalyst participates should help to realise a molecular design of a catalyst able to work at low temperature (<200 °C). Two main kinetic expressions have been reported for the formation of methanol considering the commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst.409,410 The first kinetic model considers the formation of methanol from both CO and CO2 whereas the second model only considers CO2 as the source of methanol. Despite the large number of mechanistic studies based on the theoretical and experimental data, the mechanism of methanol synthesis from CO2 remains controversial as evidence for the formation of both, formate,411–413 being the hydrogenation of HCOO to H3CO the rate-limiting step,414 and CO, as intermediates415–417 (Scheme 48). Indeed, some reports postulate that the first step of the direct hydrogenation of CO2 is the formate intermediate formation, while others propose that RWGS takes place followed by CO hydrogenation into methanol.416Scheme 49 illustrates the possible oxygenated products produced from CO2 hydrogenation.

5.2.4 Catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. 
There are more than 200 papers published in the last decade dealing with the hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol. Nevertheless, few studies reported the direct hydrogenation of CO2 into MeOH using zeolite based catalysts. However, the textural properties of ordered mesoporous silica have been used to disperse the metal-oxide active phase and to take advantage of the confinement. Due to the enhanced catalytic performance of the ternary catalyst Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, and the similarity between syngas-to-methanol conversion, Cu-based and Cu/ZnO based materials have been extensively investigated. Up to now, Cu is regarded as the main active component for CO2 hydrogenation and ZnO is regarded to promote hydrogen spillover and the dispersion of Cu nanoparticles. Numerous papers described the catalytic performance of catalysts based on Cu and/or Pd.371,418 Actually, bifunctional metal-zeolite based materials are preferentially used for the synthesis of dimethylether, olefins or aromatics since it is possible to take advantage of the acid properties of these materials and shift the process selectivity avoiding competitive side reactions. Indeed, the presence of multinuclear metal centers and active sites in a single solid catalyst presents several advantages over mononuclear catalysts due to the cooperativity effect between the different centers such as synergetic activation of substrates and electronic interactions between the metal centers, which is potentially beneficial to the catalytic activity. Hence, investigations have focussed on the preparation of metal oxides with excellent activity and stability for the hydrogenation of CO2 and efficient catalysts should exhibit high specific surface area, high number of active sites, high dispersion, optimum acid/base site distribution, and small particle size in order to increase the activity and selectivity to methanol.
(a) OMS-based catalysts for CO2 conversion to methanol. 
(i) Cu/OMS-based catalysts for CO2conversion to methanol. Cu is a good monometallic catalyst for methanol synthesis419 but, if used alone, results in low catalytic rates and selectivity towards methanol. However, the Cu catalytic performance can be enhanced by forming a Cu/ZnO active phase. Indeed, pure Cu surface is shown to convert CO2 to CO, while combination of Cu and ZnO greatly boosts the methanol formation,420 since the use of metal oxides allows high dispersion and stabilization of Cu due to special metal/metal interaction, basicity, reducibility properties and oxygen lattice, that favour the coordination and activation of CO2, maximizing the catalyst activity for methanol synthesis.421,422 So far, Cu/ZnO catalysts for industrial applications or theoretical research are still in the forefront of the investigation due to their prominent catalytic properties.422,423 The studies to improve Cu-based catalysts properties for CO2 hydrogenation into MeOH focus on improving the Cu nanoparticle dispersion by varying the preparation method and/or metal precursors and by incorporating promoters.424,425
To optimize the catalytic features, the understanding and definition of the nature of active sites in Cu/ZnO is fundamental. The metal oxide interface is crucial to enhance and create catalytic ability and the synergy of Cu and ZnOx at the interface was shown to promote the methanol synthesis.426,427 Nevertheless, destructive effects of the hydrothermal reaction conditions induce a rupture at the Cu–ZnOx interface, sintering of Cu particles that modify the catalytic properties and decrease methanol selectivity.428,429
The interaction between Cu and oxide components enables the formation of Cu–MOx (M = Zn and/or Zr) active species at the Cu–MOx interface and the catalytic activity depends on the interaction between Cu and metal oxide components.430 Therefore, the confinement or encapsulation431 of Cu–MOx on the walls of porous materials was considered as a promising route to improve the metal dispersion and the sintering resistance, and thus enhance the stability and selectivity of the catalytic system to methanol production. Accordingly, due to their textural properties (high surface areas, thermal and chemical stability and pore-size) ordered mesoporous materials offer opportunities to well-disperse and stabilize Cu–MOx or other active metal-oxide compounds (Fig. 17).
 Fig. 17  High dispersion and stabilization of metal–MOx (active metal–oxide phase) on OMS. 
(ii) Binary OMS-based catalysts for CO2hydrogenation to methanol. As we mentioned above, the application of Cu alone-catalysts are limited due to the low stability and selectivity to MeOH. Therefore, modified catalysts with MOx (Ce, Mn, Ga, Zr, and Ti) have been the purpose of many investigations due to the interfacial effects between the different metal phases that contribute to boost the catalytic performance of the final catalysts.432–434 In particular, the basic properties of some oxides are expected to enhance the adsorption/activation of CO2. For example, in Cu/ZrO2 catalysts, La doping promoted formate hydrogenation into MeOH and inhibited formate dissociation into CO.435 Following these leads, Cu–LaOx catalysts supported on SBA-15 were prepared wherein a Cu–LaOx interface was generated through the interaction of highly dispersed Cu nanoparticles with LaOx in the SBA-15 wall.436 The presence of LaOx species was beneficial to prevent the sintering of Cu and to enhance CO2 activation by adsorption of CO2 molecules at the Cu–LaOx interface. The optimized Cu1La0.2/SBA-15 catalyst displayed the best catalytic performance in terms of methanol selectivity (81.2%) and stability, with 5.7% CO2 conversion (Table 4, entry 2). The preparation and characterization of Cu–Ga/SBA-15 catalysts was also reported.437 The presence of Ga promotes the dispersion and stabilization of the Cu phase but also provides acidic sites with enhanced acidic strength due to the combination with silica. The addition of Ga improved the catalytic performance of the un-doped Cu-catalysts. 3% CO2 conversion and 71% MeOH + DME were reached with the Cu–Ga/SBA-15 catalyst (Table 4, entry 3). Attempts to disperse Cu/ZnO on SBA-15 (CZS), Al-SBA-15 (CZAS), Al2O3 (CZA) and Al2O3–ZrO2 (CZAZ) using impregnation methods were also investigated.438 The Cu/ZnO dispersed on the SBA-15 support presented the largest Cu surface area and dispersion, and the smallest particle size and was easily reduced. H2-TPR profiles showed two reduction peaks at 290 °C corresponding to the reduction of Cu2+ into Cu0 and the reduction of Cu2+ into Cu+ and into Cu0 at 337 °C. However, for Cu–ZnO/Al-SBA-15 (CZAS), a single and broad reduction peak at 370 °C was registered, attributed to strong metal–support interactions, in agreement with larger average particle size and lower metallic phase dispersion (Fig. 18). Thus, Cu/ZnO-SBA-15 exhibited the highest catalytic activity in comparison to Cu/ZnO–Al-SBA-15, Al2O3 and Al2O3/ZrO2-supported catalysts. The highest 91.32% methanol selectivity was obtained with the Cu/ZnO-SBA-15 catalyst with up to 14% CO2 conversion (Table 4, entries 4–6). The same group also studied the effect of the Cu/Zn ratio in Cu–Zn-SBA-15 catalysts on the catalytic performance in a fixed-bed.439 A positive effect of the incorporation of Zn was shown on Cu surface areas and dispersion, while a high Zn content induced an increase in the particle size and agglomeration of Cu. CO2 conversion and methanol selectivity increased while the Zn content decreased from 70% to 30%. This trend was attributed to the synergetic effect between Cu and ZnO that promotes H2 spillover. Then, a maximum 51.4 gMeOH h−1 gcat−1 productivity was reached for a metal ratio Cu:Zn = 7:3 and a linear relationship between the Cu surface area and methanol productivity was shown, with 14.2% CO2 conversion and 92.1% MeOH selectivity (Table 4, entry 7).

Recently, the catalytic performance of Cu supported on Zr-doped SBA-15 was explored.440 The Zr doping allowed promoting the formation of acid sites, and because Cu is prone to occupy the acid sites, higher Cu dispersion was reached. Before Cu nanoparticles’ confinement inside the pores, the external surface of Zr-SBA-15 was methylated and functionalized with amine groups to promote Cu2+ coordination. High catalytic activity of Cu/Zr-SBA-15 was reached, achieving 15% CO2 conversion but with low selectivity to MeOH, close to 27% (Table 4, entry 8). In a following work, the Cu/Zr-SBA-15 catalytic performance was reported under optimized reaction conditions and exhibited 25% CO2 conversion after 14 days with considerably improved methanol selectivity close to 80% (Table 4, entry 9).441 More recently, the same group reported the preparation of Cu/Zr-SBA-15 following different synthetic routes. Zr-SBA-15 was synthesized using different silica sources (TEOS and SMS) while Cu was loaded following two methods, infiltration (Inf) or evaporation induced wetness impregnation (EIWI).442 Zr-SBA-15 presented different morphological properties influenced by the silica source and synthesis conditions, while the Cu loading method has an influence on the strength and density of acid sites. Differences in catalytic selectivity were attributed to the Zr content that contributes to the electron/oxygen mobility of Cu and controlled the amount of weak and medium acid sites. The DME selectivity increases when increasing the strength of acid sites with medium acid strength. Then, Cu/Zr-SBA-15_EIWI with high total concentration of acid sites exhibited high methanol selectivity (92%) at 6.5% CO2 conversion (Table 4, entry 10). DRIFTS studies revealed that DME formation came from two surface methoxy groups in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction, when its concentration is high enough to form DME, while methanol formation is favoured since it only requires one molecule (Fig. 19).

(iii) Tertiary OMS-based catalysts for CO2hydrogenation to methanol. Numerous investigations have focused on the confinement of the Cu–ZnO–ZrO2 active phase in OMS443 due to the activity of Cu–Zn–Zr catalysts444,445 for methanol synthesis. Accordingly, the ordered mesoporous channels of SBA-15 were exploited to control the particle size, dispersion, and morphology of Cu-oxide nanoparticles, and to promote the interaction between multi-active sites for the double activation of H2 and CO2. CO2 is adsorbed on the active support while H2 is adsorbed on the Cu phase to provide atomic hydrogen. The presence of zirconia was shown to enhance both the yield and selectivity to methanol. The maximum activity for the catalyst CZZS_20_1 (Cu–ZnO–ZrO2/SBA-15) with a space-time-yield (STY) of methanol of 376 mgCH3OH h−1 gcat−1, 37-times higher than that of the unsupported homologue was reached. The enhanced catalytic performance of the SBA-15 supported catalyst was attributed to the exposure of the active phase to the CO2 and H2. An experiment of 50 h of TOS support showed the high performance, stability and the industrial potential of the CZZS_20_1 catalyst (Table 4, entry 11).
The confinement of the Cu–ZnO–MnO (CZM) active phase was also achieved in morphologically distinct siliceous porous carriers such as SBA-15, MCF and KIT-6.446 SBA-15 is a 2D mesoporous silica with pore channels in a hexagonal arrangement, MCF (mesostructured cellular foam) is a 3D mesoporous silica with large uniform spherical cells and KIT-6 is an ordered 3-D mesoporous silica with a gyroid cubic structure. The effect of different textural properties was expected to greatly influence the catalytic behavior of the prepared catalyst. Indeed, a large surface area carrier was expected to promote the formation of small metal nanoparticles with high dispersion, enabling the exposure of a large metal surface area to the reactants. CZM-SBA-15 and KIT-6 resulted to be the most efficient catalysts with 99% methanol selectivity and particularly, CZM KIT-6 exhibited a higher CO2 conversion (8.2%) and STY (Table 4, entries 12 and 13). The Cu0 particle size after reduction followed the order CZM/KIT-6 < CZM/SBA-15 < CZM/MCF, inversely to the Cu0 surface area that followed the order CZM/KIT-6 > CZM/SBA-15 > CZM/MCF. Thus, together with a higher copper surface area, the particular morphological features of KIT-6 enabled higher CO2 effective diffusivity. Therefore, the CO2 conversion was correlated with the order of copper surface area, since dissociative adsorption of H2 occurs on the copper sites, and as could be expected, the production of atomic hydrogen increases when increasing the copper surface area. The H2-TPR reduction peak was deconvoluted into two peaks assigned to the low-temperature reduction of well-dispersed CuO, and to the high-temperature reduction of bulk CuO (Fig. 20).435 For CZM/KIT-6, a lower temperature for both reduction peaks was recorded, indicating the higher dispersion of CuO and lower metallic phase/support interaction for this sample.

A study of the Ce content in Cu–ZnO–CeOx dispersed in SBA-15 showed that methanol and CO synthesis can be controlled at the interface of Cu/ZnO/CeOx due to the synergistic effects between the three active components and the basic character of CeOx.227 Suitable morphological features of SBA-15 promoted the mass and heat transfer as well as a high dispersion and exposure of the active phases, enabling the production of methanol and CO. Cu is regarded as the active site for activating hydrogen while ZnO and CeOx are the promoters, which exhibit excellent adsorption and activation capacities for CO2. CeO2 is more efficient than ZnO in promoting the dispersion of Cu nanoparticles and methanol generation, while ZnO promoted the dispersion of CeOx and the production of CO. Both ZnO and CeOx were beneficial for hydrogen spillover but mainly took part in CO2 conversion and influence product selectivity. XPS and Cu LMM XAES spectra of the reduced sample showed no satellite peaks of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 in the XPS spectrum, indicating that Cu2+ was completely reduced, while two peaks at 932.7 and 952.7 eV were assigned to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 of Cu+ or Cu0, respectively. Moreover, a broad Auger kinetic energy peak registered on the Cu LMM XAES spectrum was fitted into two peaks centered at 916.9 and 913.8 eV, corresponding to Cu0 and Cu+ species, respectively. The shift towards lower values indicates the strong interaction between metallic species, Cu, ZnO and CeOx due to the Lewis acidity of ZnO and CeOx which promotes the presence of Cu+ beneficial for the hydrogenation process. The H2-TPR profiles of the calcined samples revealed only a symmetrical peak for Zn/Ce ≤ 1 indicating the presence of only one oxidation state of CuOx with uniform particle size. High dispersion of metal oxides generally involves strong metal/support interaction leading to a shift to higher temperature of the reduction peak. However, the incorporation of Ce also promotes high dispersion of CuOx and induces a reduction peak shift to lower temperature attributing to easier reduction of the catalyst via hydrogen spillover, at the interface of Cu/CeOx.447 The catalytic performance over 10Cu8Zn2Ce/SBA-15 was maintained for 100 h (Table 4, entry 14). This study revealed new aspect to design highly dispersed active species with controlled selectivity to methanol synthesis.
(iv) Pd and other metallic catalysts for CO2hydrogenation to methanol. Pd exhibits suitable catalytic properties for CO2 hydrogenation and the presence of specific metal oxides such as Ga2O3 or CaO was shown to enhance the formation of methanol.448–450 The catalytic features of Pd catalysts based on morphologically distinct siliceous porous supports (MCM-41, SBA-15, MCM-48, MSU-F and amorphous SiO2) for CH3OH synthesis integrating alkali/alkaline earth metal additives were investigated.451 The rate of CH3OH formation in the presence of supported Ca/Pd catalysts was a function of average pore diameter, and decreased in the following order: MCM-41 > SBA-15 > MCM-48 > MSU-F ∼ amorphous SiO2. The study revealed that the smaller mesopores of MCM-41 and SBA-15 enabled the formation of small Pd nanoparticles, increasing the catalytic performance in comparison to that of the amorphous supported catalyst. Moreover, the addition of the promoter improved the catalytic activity of the catalysts, with Ca promoting the rate of CH3OH formation rather than the formation of CO. Pd(6)/Ca(0.4)/SBA-15 was active and stable for 40 h on stream to CH3OH and CO production. Nevertheless, the CH3OH selectivity (31%) remained low and required to be improved in comparison to CO selectivity (Table 4, entry 15). A few years later, the same group reported the catalytic performance of bimetallic Cu–Pd catalysts.452 Characterization results confirmed the formation of Pd–Cu alloys for hydrogen adsorption capacity for facilitating methanol production. In the precedent paper, the rate of methanol formation varied with the pore diameter of the supports, while Pd(0.25)–Cu/SiO2 was the most active catalyst with an improvement in the methanol formation rate by 27%.
Two reaction pathways were considered to take place on Pd–Cu alloy surfaces: formate hydrogenation and RWGS + CO hydrogenation. Nevertheless, the methanol STY remained low and cannot be considered for industrial application (Table 4, entry 16).
In2O3-based catalysts have been reported to possess oxygen vacancies able to activate CO2 and to exhibit higher methanol selectivity. Then, very recently, Pd, as a promoter of H2 dissociation, was introduced into In2O3/SBA-15.453 Based on DFT calculations, the synergetic effect of Pd with In2O3 was explained on the basis of the high ability of Pd sites to dissociate H2 and thus to promote the formation of more active oxygen vacancies on the In2O3 surface suitable to activate CO2. Under the best reaction conditions, 84% methanol selectivity and 12.6% CO2 conversion were achieved, giving an STY of 352 mgCH3OH h−1 gcat−1, at 260 °C and 5 MPa. No noticeable catalyst deactivation was observed for 120 h on stream. Taking into account the methanol selectivity, the space time yield, and the catalyst stability, these results illustrate the relevance of Pd–In2O3/SBA-15 for industrial application to methanol production from direct CO2 hydrogenation (Table 4, entry 18). In earlier attempts, a ternary Au/ZnO/TiO2 catalyst with small Au particles was studied for methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation.454 Accordingly, Au–CuO/SBA-15 catalysts were prepared and their catalytic behavior was studied for CO2 hydrogenation. A maximum of 13.5% selectivity to methanol was obtained at 24.2% CO2 conversion in the presence of the Au–CuO/SBA-15 catalyst with 2 wt% Au content.455 The interaction between Au and CuO helps in improving the thermal stability and the hydrogen adsorption/dissociation at the Au/CuO interface. Nevertheless, the stability and catalytic performance of Au–CuO/SBA-15 were limited and unsatisfactory (Table 4, entry 19).
(b) Zeolite-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. 

Ab initio molecular orbital and density functional theory calculations have been used to investigate the zeolite-catalyzed hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol in a concerted pathway.457 The authors showed that appropriately designed zeolite could exhibit excellent catalytic activity and allow reducing the reaction barrier by more than 200 kJ mol−1. Thus, an ideal zeolite will be a basic one obtained by exchanging acid protons with alkali metal cations to activate CO2. Then the authors proposed for the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2, a zeolite incorporating Ge, N, and Na+ into the framework. Previously, theoretical calculations revealed that a controlled substitution of specific atoms into the zeolite framework could improve the catalytic properties to complete hydrogenation of CO2.458 Previous studies reported the activity of Ru–zeolite based catalysts to CO2 hydrogenation with low methanol selectivity. Ru–NaY zeolite and mesoporous FSM-16 catalysts were prepared by ion-exchange and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods. High activity for CO2 hydrogenation but low selectivity to methanol were registered due to high methane selectivity. Co incorporation promoted MeOH selectivity of up to 7% over Co–RuY for 16 h.459,460 In previous work, Rh-ion-exchanged zeolite catalysts (RhY) showed high activity to CO2 conversion with low selectivity (up to 2.7%) to methanol.461,462
To overcome the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation for CO2 hydrogenation and improve the MeOH yield and selectivity, the continuous MeOH and water removal via selective membrane separation has received attention. Indeed, higher conversion under milder reaction conditions (lower temperature) can be reached using separation membranes. Zeolite membranes present robustness, different topologies and morphologies and versatility in their composition, with the corresponding textural and catalytic properties.
So, the use of a zeolite membrane reactor conformed with zeolite A463,464 revealing the possibility to selectively separate water and methanol with the corresponding increase in conversion, as was predicted with a mathematical model465 when compared with the operation in a traditional reactor.466,467 Nevertheless, the zeolite membrane showed limited stability for direct CO2 hydrogenation into methanol under current process conditions.
5.2.5 Conclusion. 
The direct hydrogenation of CO2 to form methanol requires further development and improvement of catalyst activity, selectivity and stability for industrial application. The hydrophobic properties of the catalyst surface have to be considered, and further studies on the nature of the catalyst active species and reaction intermediates are required for a successful design of an efficient and selective catalyst. The reported catalysts are multifunctional and multidimensional, characterized by different active sites with different chemical and oxidation states, with different electronic and geometrical environments with specific activities for each stage of the CO2 to methanol transformation process. It is therefore crucial to determine and control the active species, reaction intermediates and kinetics for the rational design of more efficient catalysts. Thus a better understanding and knowledge of what happens at the molecular level should help to find consensus on the mechanisms involved in the hydrogenation reaction of CO2 to methanol of which adsorption phenomena are key. Therefore, the successful design of a new efficient catalyst requires the combination of computational chemistry studies with in situ spectroscopy to elucidate the fundamental steps for the adsorption and activation of CO2 and H2, for the hydrogenation reaction and the desorption of the product.
In addition, special attention should be paid to the morphology of the support to improve the physical isolation and shielding of metal species. In this regard, the use of OMS materials, hierarchical zeolites, two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets and core–shell materials can promote the amount, dispersion and stabilization of the active centers.
Considering thermodynamics, the development of catalysts able to work at low temperature and high pressure is a clear objective. The morphology, topology, thermal stability, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, acid/base and redox properties of zeolite and OMS materials are properties that can be tailored when designing new catalysts and they should play a key role.
Patent literature468–470 indicates some distinguishable pilot plant processes by Air Liquide Forschung und Entwicklung GmbH (ALFE) and Lurgi GmbH or Mitsui process471 using Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3/SiO2 catalysts, while zeolite and OMS based catalysts are far from reaching industrial targets. Air Liquide Forschung und Entwicklung GmbH (ALFE) and Lurgi GmbH use a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst developed by Süd-Chemie (Clariant),468,470 working in Pilot Plant, with a gas composition of 24/2/74 = CO2:N2:H2 and GHSV of 10500 h−1, at 8 MPa and 250 °C give 35–45% CO2 conversion and an MeOH STY of about 0.6 kg Lcat−1 h−1. The catalyst suffered from slight deactivation and was stable over 600 h. The water content of MeOH is 30–40 wt%, which is superior to the water content in MeOH produced from syngas (10–12 wt%). The Mitsui process uses a Cu/ZnO/ZrO2/Al2O3/SiO2 catalyst471 at 250 °C, 5 MPa, and GHSV = 10000 h−1, and produces high MeOH purity (0.26 kg h−1), with high water content (0.26 kg h−1), at CO2 conversion of up to 86%. No data were provided for methanol selectivity, or for the H2/CO2 ratio used, so methanol selectivity could not be determined. We present here the results reported for CO2 conversion and MeOH selectivity using structured mesoporous materials as supports, and the promising results are outlined (Fig. 21).

5.3 Catalytic methylation of aromatics with CO2/H2. 
Aromatics are important intermediates for petrochemical and chemical industries. Among them, xylenes found numerous applications in polymer (polyester), resin and plasticizer synthesis. Thus, C-methylation is a key transformation for the preparation of xylenes which is usually performed with MeOH and zeolites.472–474 Methylation of toluene with methanol over the zeolite catalyst (ZSM-5) affords water and xylenes with 23.5% p-xylene, 52.4% m-xylene, and 24% o-xylene, which corresponds to the thermodynamic equilibrium composition at 400 °C.475 The modifications of the catalytic properties of zeolites by controlling the acidity on the external surface of the zeolite, the pore sizes and products diffusion inside the pore system allowed maximizing p-xylene selectivity.474,476–479 Therefore, p-xylene selectivity of up to 100% over the Mg modified ZSM-5 catalyst at low space time has been reported at 440–450 °C with high steam content in feed.480,481 Taking the above into account, it is clear that the use of CO2/H2 for the catalytic methylation of aromatics constitutes a green alternative and could help to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Scheme 50). Since methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation81,371,482,483 has been widely studied, the combination of catalytic properties or directly of catalysts suitable to perform methanol synthesis and C-methylation should enable the methylation of aromatics starting from CO2/H2. It seems that for this cascade process, it may be worthwhile to study micro- and mesoporous catalysts. Very recently, the catalytic methylation of aromatics using CO2/H2 using a physical mixture of Re/TiO2 and H-MOR, both catalysts suitable for the methanol production and subsequent C-methylation at low temperature, was reported484 with good catalytic performance at 1 MPa PCO2, 5 MPa; PH2, 250 °C and 20 h in a batch reactor. Under such conditions, 52% and 42% yields of methylated benzenes were obtained on the base of benzene-based yield and CO2-based yield, respectively. The catalysts screening showed that the best support for Re was TiO2 and that Re was the best metal for CO2 hydrogenation, while H-MOR was the best zeolite for C-methylation among ZSM-5, BEA, FAU and CHA structures, with an optimum Si/Al2O3 of 90. The process was also performed over the optimized catalytic system using MeOH, CO/H2 and HCOOH/H2. Best results were obtained with MeOH indicating that MeOH could be the intermediate, with MeOH formation occurring over Re/TiO2 and methylation over HMOR(90). These results are promising although the selectivity to xylenes and p-xylene is still low and no data for a continuous process have been reported. Most recently, methylation of toluene using CO2/H2 over ZnZrOx–ZSM-5 (ZZO-Z5) dual functional catalysts was also studied.485 The in situ DRIFT study showed, comparing methanol and CO2/H2 methylation routes, that reactive methylation species H3CO* were more easily obtained from CO2 hydrogenation over ZZO-Z5 catalysts. The results suggested that after CO2 hydrogenation following the formate route, the reactive methylation species formed over ZZO migrated into zeolite pores where toluene methylation took place. Under optimized reaction conditions in a fixed-bed reactor, the ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 85) modified in order to decrease the pore size, with 10 wt% of ZZO (ZZO-4SZ5), at 360 °C, 3.0 MPa, GHSV = 12000 mL g−1 hour−1 and WHSVToluene = 1 h, allowed reaching 92.4% xylene selectivity with 70.8% p-xylene selectivity and 13% toluene conversion (Fig. 22). These results clearly showed the potential and feasibility of C-methylation of toluene using CO2/H2.

We see how these works constitute the seed for the exploration of C-methylation of aromatics with CO2/H2 and xylene products, showing the great potential of this new reaction and of the multifunctional catalytic system integrating zeolites.


5.4 Direct conversion of CO2 to dimethylether (DME). 
5.4.1 Introduction. 
Worldwide DME production stands at approximately 5 million tons per year, being mainly obtained by methanol dehydration, and the majority of DME production is currently in China.486 Dimethyl ether (DME) is the simplest ether, is non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, non-teratogenic, non-mutagenic and environmentally benign487 with a boiling point of 25 °C. Under normal atmospheric conditions, DME is a colorless gas and can be easily stored as a liquid at room temperature and low pressure (∼0.5 MPa). DME is considered a potential clean transport fuel and an alternative to diesel,488 especially in compression ignition diesel engines due to high cetane number (55–60)489 and low auto-ignition temperature (235 °C).490 DME is a clean energy source and does not produce sulfur oxide or soot during combustion, and its environmental impact is low especially if it is produced from renewable resources.491 DME is used extensively in the chemical industry, progressively replacing petroleum derivatives for the synthesis of a large number of chemicals such as methyl acetate, dimethyl sulphate, olefins, isoparaffin-rich gasoline,492 methylating agent, solvent and aerosol propellant (Fig. 23). A life cycle analysis revealed the interest of methanol and DME as clean transport fuels and showed that methanol and DME can be economically competitive with respect to oil derived fuels.487,493–495
 Fig. 23  Illustration of DME synthesis and uses. 
DME synthesis can be performed in either a two-step or a single-step process, commonly referred to as direct or indirect synthesis, respectively. DME is usually produced directly from syngas (CO/H2)405,496–498 eventually with low amount of CO2 (<3%) or by dehydration of methanol,404,499–501 which in turn is produced from syngas.
The conventional indirect synthesis undergoes firstly methanol production in the presence of a metallic-based catalyst from syngas or CO2 hydrogenation, followed in a second step by methanol dehydration over a solid acid catalysts such as γ-alumina or zeolite.495,502–505 Since methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation was above-reviewed, only the direct DME synthesis in a single-step (with economic advantage over a two-step process), requiring the use of efficient bifunctional catalysts, has been covered here.
The direct DME synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation is very attractive506 since it is environmentally friendly and can be an economical route. The catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 for direct synthesis of DME enables increasing considerably the CO2 conversion because methanol dehydration breaks the thermodynamic balance of methanol synthesis. However, direct DME synthesis produces a larger amount of water than methanol synthesis alone that damages the activity and stability of the catalysts. It is generally assumed that direct transformation of CO2 to DME involves methanol synthesis and methanol dehydration and requires bifunctional catalysts. These active sites can be integrated in a hybrid catalyst507–510 or can be present in two different catalysts physically mixed.511–513 In the last case, the combination of both types of active sites, metal-oxide and acid sites, present some limitations such as no uniform distribution of active sites, mass transfer constraints and limited reproducibility. Therefore the presence of metal oxide and acid sites in a single system500,514,515 could improve mass transfer, CO2 conversion and rates of hydrogenation/dehydration, due to the proximity of active sites.
5.4.2 Thermodynamics of direct DME synthesis. 
The DME synthesis involves three main reactions, the RWGS, the methanol synthesis and dehydration (Scheme 51). With the exception of RWGS, all the reactions are exothermic and so thermodynamically disfavoured with high temperature. The dehydration reaction of methanol occurs without variation in the number of moles and is slightly exothermic over solid acid catalysts.516,517 Accordingly, the process pressure does not affect the extent of the dehydration reaction while lower temperatures are thermodynamically beneficial. Besides, the dehydration reaction of methanol allows shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium for CO2 hydrogenation and working at lower pressure and higher temperatures (>240 °C) that have been shown to promote the CO2 activation rate and the formation of methanol or carbon monoxide.518
 Scheme 51  Equations of different reactions involved in direct DME synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation. 
As it occurs for methanol synthesis, where the active catalyst for methanol from syngas showed to be active for CO2 hydrogenation, the active catalysts for DME synthesis from syngas exhibit activity to DME synthesis from CO2. For methanol synthesis, the suitable properties of Cu0 for H2 dissociation, and the dispersion effect of carrier oxides519–522 such as ZnO, Al2O3, and ZrO2 providing an active metal–oxide interface to the CO2 adsorption and activation have been largely described and studied. Accordingly, the direct CO2 hydrogenation into DME is generally performed in the presence of Cu-based methanol synthesis catalyst (CuO–ZnO–Al2O3 or CuO–ZnO–ZrO2)511,523 and an acid catalyst, such as γ-Al2O3, silica–alumina or zeolites for methanol dehydration. Due to its acid properties γ-alumina could be a good candidate for the methanol dehydration reaction but as we discussed for methanol synthesis, alumina presents some limitations. The hydrophilicity of γ-alumina and ZnO has a negative effect over the metal particle stability and favours sintering and agglomeration. Moreover, water has strong competitive adsorption with methanol and so it inhibits the methanol dehydration step. Zeolites offer great potential due to suitable and controllable Brønsted and Lewis acid properties, water resistance and shape-selectivity. Among zeolites, HZSM-5 zeolite based catalysts have been widely used for methanol dehydration due to their suitable acid properties that have to be tuned to avoid the formation of hydrocarbons. Following these leads, numerous catalytic systems based on Cu and HZSM-5 have been studied for the direct hydrogenation of CO2. The metal particle size, usually Cu, plays a great role in methanol synthesis activity, and consequently in DME formation. Nevertheless, the stability of Cu particles, under reaction conditions, is limited due to sintering and agglomeration, as it was discussed for methanol synthesis. Hence, different strategies, such as the addition of a dispersive phase or promoters (ZnO, ZrO2, La2O3, CeO2, and MnO2) or the addition of a second hydrogenation metal with suitable properties to dissociate H2 such as Pd, are followed to improve the bifunctional catalytic system. Then, different preparation methods have been developed, including co-precipitation, sol–gel, citrate or impregnation routes, in order to increase the catalyst activity and stability. The main challenge is to reach high DME selectivity (>70%) at a high CO2 conversion level, minimizing CO production and avoiding catalyst deactivation.
5.4.3 Cu-based catalysts for direct DME synthesis. 
Cu-based zeolite catalysts have been the main zeolitic catalysts reported up to now for the transformation of CO2 into DME. Catalytic systems to direct transformation of CO2 to DME have to contain active sites for methanol synthesis and for methanol dehydration that could be integrated with a hybrid catalyst or which are present in two different catalysts physically mixed. For the first time a hybrid catalyst incorporating both functionalities for methanol synthesis and methanol dehydration was prepared by impregnation in 2001.524 The Cu–Mo supported HZSM-5 catalyst was found to be highly active for DME synthesis. The addition of a small amount of Mo enhanced the catalytic activity of the hybrid catalyst that was found to be stable for 10 h of time of stream. DME was produced with high selectivity of up to 77% and low 12.3% CO2 conversion, at 240 °C and 2 MPa (Table 5, entry 1).

(a) SAPO-based catalysts for direct DME synthesis. 
Recently the catalytic performance of the Cu–In–Zr–O (CIZO) mixed oxide nanomaterial and commercial SAPO-34 zeolite physically mixed has been reported.525 The best CIZO/SAPO ratio was 50/50 by weight, and a maximum of 4.3% CO2 conversion and 65.1% DME selectivity were achieved at 250 °C and 3 MPa (Table 5, entry 2; Fig. 24). These catalytic data are inferior in comparison to the catalytic performance of other multi-functional catalytic system reported previously.

(b) Cu–ZnO–Al2O3-based zeolite catalysts for direct DME synthesis. 
A large variety of catalysts for direct CO2 hydrogenation into DME have been studied such as Cu–ZnO, Pd and bimetallic catalysts. Among them, Cu–ZnO based catalysts are undoubtedly the most commonly explored and used. Among the Cu based catalysts, the mostly studied and employed catalytic system for direct DME synthesis from CO2 are conventionally Cu–ZnO–Al2O3 and Cu–ZnO–ZrO2 based catalysts. Cu–ZnO–Al2O3 based catalysts are traditionally used for direct hydrogenation of CO2 into methanol and have been widely used and studied for direct hydrogenation of CO2 into DME. The catalytic system should consist of a physical mixture or hybrid catalysts with active sites for both methanol synthesis and dehydration that will involve a zeolite function.
(i) Physical mixture of Cu–ZnO–Al2O3and zeolite catalysts for direct DME synthesis. The catalytic performance of CuO–ZnO–Al2O3 prepared by a simple and fast urea-nitrate combustion method that was physically mixed with HZSM-5 by grinding showed to be dependent on the amount of urea used as fuel, affecting the grain size and copper surface areas and so the catalytic properties.523 The catalyst prepared with 40% of the stoichiometric amount of urea exhibited the best catalytic properties due to its higher Cu surface area and the smaller Cu particle size. At 270 °C and 3 MPa, maximum 30.6% CO2 conversion, 15.1% and 49.2% DME yield and selectivity were achieved, respectively (Table 5, entry 3). A catalytic system based on pretreated carbon nanotubes with graphitized tube-walls (multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)), was used as the carrier for the preparation of CuO–ZnO–Al2O3/HZSM-5 catalysts by ultrasound-assisted co-precipitation.526 CuO–ZnO–Al2O3 nanoparticles were densely deposited outside and inside the wall of carbon nanotubes and bifunctional catalysts were obtained by mechanical mixing of MWCNTs and HZSM-5. At 262 °C and 3.0 MPa, 46.2% CO2 conversion, 20.9% and 45.2% DME yield and selectivity, respectively, were obtained (Table 5, entry 4). Recently, CuO–ZnO–Al2O3 catalysts with a high BET surface area and Cu surface area were prepared by a co-precipitation method and used after physically mixing with HZSM-5 for DME synthesis.527 The bifunctional mixture showed high activity and DME selectivity due to the microstructure of the catalysts that was controlled by the preparation method used. Maximum 21.9% DME yield, 30.5% CO2 conversion and good 72% DME selectivity were achieved at 260 °C and 4.2 MPa (Table 5, entry 5). A stability test of the catalyst mixture showed a notable decrease in activity within the first 20 h. Nevertheless, high catalytic performance was maintained for 100 h, with 21.4% CO2 conversion and 55.5% DME selectivity. The changes in the catalytic activity during the time on stream were attributed to Cu sintering and alterations in the surface area.
(ii) Hybrid catalyst based on Cu–ZnO–Al2O3and zeolite for direct DME synthesis. Cu–ZnO–Al2O3/FER catalysts have been prepared by co-precipitation528 giving a maximum production rate of DME for an optimal zeolite Si/Al molar ratio of 12 owing to the larger metallic surface area of Cu nanoparticles and relatively higher hydrophobic surface. The authors reported that a smaller Cu particle size decorated with ZnO moieties in the larger Cu–ZnO–Al2O3 matrices increased the hydrophobic surfaces of the catalytic system, preventing the poisoning of acid sites of the zeolite and Cu aggregation. CO2 conversion of 29.7% with 55.2% DME selectivity at 250 °C and 5 MPa was achieved (Table 5, entry 6).
(iii) Morphology and structuration of the catalysts for direct DME synthesis. Different strategies to design and prepare new structured zeolitic catalysts with high dispersion and stabilized metallic active sites have been investigated. For methanol synthesis, it was demonstrated that the yield and selectivity were highly dependent on Cu dispersion and surface area. However, Cu in Cu–ZnO based catalysts is thermally unstable and the particle size increases with temperature over 250 °C inducing the loss of surface area and sintering. Moreover, the production of water causes poisoning of acid active sites and Cu sintering. Rare earth metal oxides added in small amounts usually act as promoters to improve the dispersion of the active phase and the thermal stability of the catalysts. Following these leads, and to improve the catalytic properties of CuO–ZnO–Al2O3/HZSM-5, a new design of catalyst structure was developed. An encapsulated catalyst composed of CuO–ZnO–Al2O3 composite nanoparticles as the core and HZSM-5 as the shell was prepared, with the HZSM-5 shell being synthesized hydrothermally onto CuO–ZnO–Al2O3 nanoparticles.529 At 270 °C and 3.0 MPa, 48.3% CO2 conversion and 23.4 and 48.5% of DME yield and selectivity were reached (Table 5, entry 7). No deactivation of the catalyst was observed for the first 24 h. Then, the catalyst stability was attributed to the core–shell structure that allowed controlling the consecutive order of the reaction, methanol synthesis and methanol dehydration. In 2012, a hydrothermal route for the preparation of new hybrid materials composed of CuO–ZnO as the core layer and HZSM-5 as the shell layer was described.530 The comparison of hydrothermal, impregnation and mixing preparation methods showed that the one-step crystallization method provided a catalyst with higher catalytic performance. CO2 conversion of 21.3% with 50.8% DME selectivity and MeOH + DME yield up to 12.4%, at 245 °C and 3 MPa was achieved by this catalyst preparation method (Table 5, entry 8).
(iv) Promoter incorporation to the Cu–ZnO–Al2O3based-zeolite catalysts for direct DME synthesis. As was mentioned for methanol synthesis, the incorporation of metal oxides to Cu-based catalysts promotes the Cu dispersion, stabilization and the formation of new metallic active phases for the methanol synthesis by CO and CO2 hydrogenation. GaO, ZrO2, Cr2O3, MnO2, or CeO2 have been used as promoters and from these, ZrO2 was particularly prominent. Following these leads, a series of CuO–ZnO–Al2O3–La2O3/HZSM-5 (CZA/HZ) bifunctional catalysts with various La loadings were prepared by co-precipitation.531 The controlled addition of La2O3 improved the reducibility and dispersion of bifunctional catalysts, and a decrease in the CuO particle size was observed. H2-TPR profiles showed that La incorporation induced an increase of peak area of reduction of CuO indicating that CuO species dispersion was improved by incorporating La. Moreover, a shift of the reduction peak positions to higher temperatures was observed with La incorporation of up to 2%, as well as a shift to lower temperatures. These results indicate that La2O3 also makes difficult the reduction of CuO because of the strong interactions between metallic phases ZnO–CuO–La2O3. It was concluded that La doping allows enhancing the dispersion of the CuO copper oxide and reduction of CuO while the strong interactions between CuO–ZnO–La2O3 hinder the reduction of CuO, implying that a balance between the benefits and detriments of La2O3 addition has to be found (Fig. 25). On the other hand, the addition of La into the CuO–ZnO–Al2O3–La2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst modified the strength of the strong acid sites, and an optimum catalytic performance was obtained with 2 wt% La content. Indeed, NH3-TPD profiles showed that the amount of the strong acid increased to a maximum with La content, up to 2 wt%, and then decreased. This behavior was attributed to the acidic properties of the lanthanum ions, and to the polarization of the hydroxyl group of the silicon and aluminum framework, leading to stronger acidity.532 At higher La contents, the formation of La2O3 with basic properties involves the formation of new basic sites on the catalytic surface.533 At 250 °C and 2 MPa, high 43.8% CO2 conversion and 71.2% selectivity to DME were reached (Table 5, entry 9). In the same way, ZrO2 was added to the CuO–ZnO–Al2O3 active phase. A series of composite catalysts were prepared by a wet mixing method of CuO–ZnO–Al2O3–ZrO2 component to HZSM-5 zeolite with a molar ratio of 2:1.521 H2-TPR profiles showed that for Zr content <5 wt%, a main reduction peak with a shoulder at higher temperature was registered, implying the presence of different Cu species, with the main peak being assigned to high dispersed copper oxide species and the shoulder to CuO bulk. For Zr content >5%, only one reduction peak was recorded, lightly shifted at higher temperature, indicating lower reducibility of CuO due to strong interactions of CuO–ZrO2–ZnO–Al2O3. In comparison to other promoted catalysts, 24.1% CO2 conversion and lower 26.6% and 6.4% of DME selectivity and yield, respectively, were achieved at 260 °C and 3 MPa, (Table 5, entry 10).

(c) Cu–ZnO–ZrO2-based catalysts for the direct DME synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation. 
Hybrid catalysts composed of Cu–ZnO–ZrO2 and zeolites for methanol dehydration such as ferrierite or ZSM-5 for DME synthesis have been largely explored and showed to be usually more efficient catalysts than conventional Cu–ZnO–Al2O3-based catalysts. Indeed, the interactions of Cu metal particles with ZnO and ZrO2 lead to the stabilization of different Cu species, Cu1+ and Cu0.418
(i) Effect of proximity between acid and metallic active sites. The catalytic behavior of the adequate combination of Cu–ZnO–ZrO2 materials and commercial H-ZSM5 to the direct CO2 hydrogenation reaction to DME was studied in different reactor bed configurations (physical mixing (ZZ-M), dual-bed (ZZ-D) and mono-bed prepared by grinding and pelletization (ZZ-G)).518,534 At 3.0 MPa, the CO2 conversion varied from 1.6 to 16.1%, at 180 and 240 °C, respectively. Meanwhile the DME selectivity decreased drastically from 70.9 to 33.9% and methanol selectivity decreased from 21.7 to 11.8% due to a notable CO selectivity increase from 7.4 to 54.3%. The ZZ-M system exhibited the best performance with STY values increasing from 130 to 430 gtotalMeOH kgcat−1 h−1, at 180 and 240 °C, respectively, while the ZZ-G system reached the lowest productivity (Table 5, entry 11). The best results achieved over the mixed catalyst in comparison to the dual bed system configuration were attributed to the enhanced methanol mass transfer from the methanol catalyst sites to the zeolite acid sites owing to the proximity of the active centres. Grinding was negative because of deterioration of the interaction between the methanol catalyst and zeolite due to strong mechanical stress. The methanol catalyst (ZCZ) structure was damaged favouring the redistribution of Cu over zeolites. In this respect, different strategies have been developed to improve the proximity of the different functionalities. One approach is the co-precipitation of metal oxides in the presence of acid carriers in order to provide hybrid materials with both metal-oxides and acid sites in a single catalyst grain. Accordingly Frusteri and co-workers reported different investigations where the effects of carriers, precipitating agents and the ratio of metal oxides:carrier were studied. They compared the DME productivity achieved in the presence of a physical mixture of the CuZnZr methanol catalyst and a zeolite, and in the presence of a multifunctional system, in which the different active sites were integrated during the gel-oxalate precipitation of the Cu–Zn–Zr precursors in a solution containing dispersed MFI-zeolite.535 In principle, the synthesis of a hybrid system by co-precipitation should maintain the adequate properties of the active sites and enable a higher yield of DME due to the regular and homogeneous distribution, and proximity of the active sites. In the presence of the co-precipitated catalyst, the DME selectivity was higher while the CO2 conversion was practically the same, 15.9% versus 15.4%. The CO2 conversion was not improved by the proximity of the acid sites that were supposed to shift positively the equilibrium and achieve higher value than for CO2 hydrogenation into MeOH (18%). Under optimized reaction conditions, 240 °C and 5.0 MPa, maximum CO2 conversion of up to 23.6% with lower 24.5% CO selectivity, and therefore higher selectivity to MeOH and DME, 25.5 and 49.3%, were achieved, respectively (Table 5, entry 12). The authors adopted co-precipitation as a simple method to prepare Cu-based hybrid catalysts, and ensure the presence of the multifunctionality grain-to-grain.
(ii) Effect of catalyst preparation on the catalytic activity. It was shown before that co-precipitation resulted in a simple method to prepare Cu-based hybrid catalysts, and ensure the presence of the multifunctionality grain-to-grain. Therefore, a study of the impact of different parameters of co-precipitation to the preparation of Cu–ZnO–ZrO2/H-ZSM5 multifunctional catalysts on their catalytic features was performed.536 Likewise, different precipitating agents (sodium bicarbonate, ammonium carbonate, oxalic acid and urea) were used under ultrasound to match morphological homogeneity. The multifunctional catalyst prepared via ammonium carbonate precipitation exhibited the best catalytic performance, high DME selectivity, with a maximum DME productivity, 0.225 kgDME kgcat−1 h−1 (Table 5, entry 13). The characterization study revealed that a balanced distribution of different sites on the catalyst surface became determinant: the strength of basic sites, the ratio between acid and basic sites and the Cu particle sizes were crucial to maximize the catalytic performance and minimize CO selectivity. The CuO–ZnO–ZrO2/HZSM-5 system revealed to be a promising catalyst for direct conversion of CO2 into DME.534–536 CuO–ZnO–ZrO2/HZSM-5 bifunctional catalysts were generally prepared by physical or mechanical mixing methods. However to improve the yield of the consecutive methanol synthesis and dehydration, high and homogeneous dispersion of both functionalities is crucial to favour an efficient mass transfer rate from the metal-oxide sites for methanol synthesis to the acid sites for methanol dehydration.536 Therefore, co-precipitation methods were developed to prepare the CuO–ZnO–ZrO2/HZSM-5 catalysts. Nevertheless, these methods present some drawbacks such as the use of metal salts associated with the proton zeolite exchange with both Na and Cu cations. Consequently, the acidic properties of HZSM-5 are reduced, affecting the methanol dehydration step. A few years ago, the preparation of CuO–ZnO–ZrO2/HZSM-5 by a solid-state route was reported.537 A study of calcination temperature showed that the catalytic performance of CuO–ZnO–ZrO2/HZSM-5 catalysts for DME synthesis decreased gradually with an increase in temperature from 300 to 600 °C whereas the CO yield increased. The characterization study revealed that reduction of metallic copper surface area, adsorption capacity of CO2, surface area, and reducibility of CuO were strongly affected by the calcination temperature and the suitable temperature was 300 °C. Highest 22.2% CO2 conversion, and 67.6 and 15% DME selectivity and yield were achieved with a DME productivity of 0.507 gDME gcat−1 h−1 (Table 5, entry 14). Recently, the catalytic properties of Cu–ZnO–ZrO2-FER catalysts prepared by the co-precipitation method has enabled to obtain materials with smaller CuO and Cu particle sizes resulting in better dispersion of the active phases, higher surface area, and lower reduction temperature.538 Nevertheless, in comparison to other studies, these data remained low. Highest 17.5% CO2 conversion, and 28.4 and 5% DME selectivity and yield were achieved, at 250 °C and 2 MPa (Table 5, entry 15).
(iii) Effect of zeolite topology on the catalytic activity. The effect of zeolite framework topology is well-known to influence the distribution of the reaction products58 and to control the diffusion and adsorption/deposition of metallic species into the channels. The differences in the voids and microenvironments defined by the topologies of zeolites strongly influenced the stabilization and dispersion of metallic active sites.50,87,539,540 Accordingly, zeolites with different topologies were used as support of the CuZnZr metallic active phase. Recently, the superiority of ferrierite based catalysts with respect to other zeolite based catalysts typically used, such as ZSM-5, was shown. Different zeolite structures, FER and MOR,509 were used as carriers to study the topology impacts on acidity, surface area, microporosity and metal-oxide loading, and in turn on the catalytic performance of the catalysts. The CuZnZr/FER catalyst exhibited very good activity and selectivity to DME formation, at 5.0 MPa and 280 °C, with very interesting results on DME productivity up to 0.752 kgDME kgcat−1 h−1, and no coke formation was observed (GHSV = 8800 NL kgcat−1 h−1) (Table 5, entry 16). The presence of well dispersed metal-oxide clusters of CuZnZr mixed oxides, with size between 30 and 150 nm, on the external surface of the FER zeolite revealed to be a key factor to enhance the mass transfer of MeOH from CuZnZr sites to acid sites and favoured the formation of DME. A CuZnZr:FER weight ratio greater than 1 enabled higher catalytic performance, with CO2 conversion of up to 23.6% at 260 °C and a MeOH/DME yield of up to 15% (Table 5, entry 18).541 The comparison of the catalytic behavior of Cu–Zn–Zr on MOR, FER, MFI revealed that functionalities such as the metallic dispersion and acidic activity were strongly affected by the zeolite structure. The FER zeolite enabled a better dispersion of cluster oxides and the formation of Lewis basic sites for CO2 activation and provided a high number of suitable Brønsted acid sites for the MeOH dehydration step. The optimum and homogeneous dispersion of active sites was attributed to the ferrierite lamellar structure with interconnection of bi-dimensional channels. A maximum DME productivity of 0.6 kgDME kgcat−1 h−1 in the presence of a Cu–Zn–Zr/FER catalyst, at 260 °C and 5 MPa (Table 5, entry 18), was achieved owing to the enhanced methanol mass transfer owing to the proximity of the active sites. Nevertheless, a progressive deactivation due to water formation was observed. Currently, the same group reported the catalytic performance of the CuZnZr hybrid catalyst using different zeolites (Sil-1, MFI, Y, FER, BEA, and MOR) and a gel–oxalate co-precipitation method.542,543 Different textural, structural and morphological properties according to the carrier structure were observed. Mordenite revealed to be the most efficient carrier for the generation and dispersion of functionalities with high DME productivity of 0.55 kgDME−1 kgcat h−1 at 280 °C and 3.0 MPa (Table 5, entries 19–23). The deactivation was again attributed to the water formation and inhibition of active sites.
(iv) Effect of Si/Al ratio on the catalytic activity. Since the Si/Al ratio allows controlling the acid and adsorption properties of zeolites, the Si/Al ratio directly influenced their catalytic performance. Accordingly, different Cu–ZnO–ZrO2/FER (CZZ/FER) hybrid catalysts using ferrierite samples with different acidities and particle sizes were prepared.508 The catalytic results revealed that samples with larger acidity exhibited higher deactivation whereas the use of TEM allowed attributing the deactivation to metal sintering, which was proportional to the Si/Al ratio (Fig. 26; Table 5, entry 24). An exhaustive FT-IR spectroscopy study allowed concluding that both negatively influenced CO2 activation by Cu particle sintering and acidity loss due to H+ exchange with Cu2+ cations were responsible for the rapid deactivation of Cu–ZnO–ZrO2/FER hybrid catalysts.544

(v) Effect of promoter incorporation on the catalytic activity. Many efforts have been taken to improve the catalytic properties of bifunctional catalysts such as modifying the synthesis method by sol–gel, co-precipitation and by designing new core–shell structures. Another strategy to improve the active metallic phase dispersion and stability is the incorporation of promoters (Ga, Mn, La, Ce, Y, Si and Ti) allowing the formation of new active species for CO2 activation and establishing strong metal/metal and metal/support interaction.519–522 In comparison to single oxides, mixed oxides present higher surface area, thermal stability and enhanced acidity, improving their catalytic performance.545–548 Accordingly, the CuO–TiO2–ZrO2/HZSM-5 catalyst with a Ti/Zr ratio of 1 prepared by co-precipitation exhibited higher catalytic performance than CuO–TiO2/HZSM-5 and CuO–ZrO2/HZSM-5 catalysts (Table 5, entry 25).512 Maximum 15.6% CO2 conversion and 47.5 and 7.41% DME selectivity and yield were obtained at 250 °C and 3 MPa. With suitable 0.5 wt% V loading, the catalytic performance of the CuO–ZnO–ZrO2/HZSM-5 catalyst was improved and a substantial increase of CO2 conversion from 28.9 to 32.5%, of DME selectivity from 55.1 to 58.8% and DME yield from 15.9 to 19.1% was observed, at 270 °C and 3.0 MPa (Table 5, entry 26).549 In comparison to 14% DME yield over the Pd modified CuO–ZnO–Al2O3–ZrO2/HZSM-5550 catalyst, this result could be interesting, but the selectivity remained low, 58.8% versus 73.5% (Table 5, entry 27). Following these leads, CuO–ZnO–CeO2–ZrO2/HZSM-5 catalysts were prepared.226 The incorporation of CeO2 improved the catalytic performance of the bifunctional catalysts, and the CO2 conversion and DME selectivity were increased from 12.9 to 15.6% and from 17.3% to 46.6%, respectively, over the CuO–ZnO–CeO2–ZrO2/HZSM-5 catalyst with a Ce/Zr molar ratio of 1/1, at 250 °C and 3.0 MPa (Table 5, entry 28). La doped Cu–ZrO2 catalysts were also prepared and revealed an increase of the amount of basic sites with La loading as well as a decrease in the crystallite size of CuO improving the Cu dispersion.435,551 Accordingly, La2O3-modified CuO–ZnO–ZrO2/HZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by an oxalate co-precipitation method for DME direct synthesis (Table 5, entry 29).552 A suitable amount of La2O3 improved the catalytic performance of CuO–ZnO–ZrO2/HZSM-5, and maximum 34.3% CO2 conversion and 57.3 and 19.6% DME selectivity and yield were obtained over the catalyst with 1% La2O3 at 270 °C and 3 MPa. The addition of La2O3 modified the population and strength of acid sites as well as the dispersion of Cu and reducibility of CuO with a larger Cu+/Cu ratio. The addition of different oxides promoters (ZrO2, CeO2, La2O3, Al2O3, and Ga2O3) could play an important role over the catalytic performance of Cu–ZnO/FER hybrid catalysts. Accordingly, the incorporation of different promoters in the Cu–ZnO/FER system significantly affected the textural properties of the customized catalysts (surface area, pore volume, copper surface area and dispersion, metal-oxide distribution and acid/base capacity).553 The reaction rate appeared to be strongly dependent on the number of medium-strong basic sites, with the number and strength of the basic sites crucial for the CO2 activation, whereas the rate of DME formation depended on the concentration of weak-medium acid sites (Fig. 27). Consequently, different catalytic behaviors were observed and Zr, Al or Ga doped Cu–ZnO/FER catalysts exhibited similar patterns for the DME production, while the incorporation of Ce and La damaged the catalytic properties. CO2 hydrogenation into DME was performed at 260 °C and 3 MPa in the presence of a ZrO2 doped Cu–ZnO/FER hybrid catalyst with MeOH, DME and CO selectivity of 14.4, 36.5 and 49.1% with 21.3% CO2 conversion (Table 5, entry 30). Although the Cu–ZnO–ZrO2/FER hybrid catalyst exhibited high catalytic performance, rapid catalyst deactivation was observed.

(d) Mechanistic studies for the direct DME synthesis. 
Mechanistic insights for the direct DME synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation with a bifunctional catalyst system formed with a physical mixture of a Cu–In–Zr–O (CIZO) mixed oxide nanomaterial and a commercial SAPO-34 zeolite catalyst were achieved by an in situ DRIFT study. It was found that changing the distance between CIZO and SAPO could modify the reaction pathways. Likewise, a short distance between CIZO and SAPO induced a shortcut methoxy-DME pathway instead of a typical methoxy–methanol–DME route, resulting in more efficient DME formation (Scheme 52).525
 Scheme 52  DME synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation can involve two pathways: methoxy–methanol–DME and methoxy–DME. 
Very recently, an intrinsic kinetic model for direct CO2 hydrogenation to DME over the Cu–Fe–Zr/HZSM-5 catalyst has been established.554 The addition of a small amount of ZrO2 in a Cu-based catalyst is known to improve Cu dispersion and stability. Therefore, the incorporation of ZrO2 (1.0 wt%) in the Cu–Fe/HZSM-5 catalyst helped in strengthening the adsorption interactions of the Cu–Fe catalyst and increasing the number of active sites on the catalyst surface. Different DFT studies have revealed that Cu-based catalysts doped with transition metal oxides adsorb H2 by dissociative adsorption onto Cu, while CO2 is adsorbed and activated over the transition metal oxides. To continue, CO2 desorbs from the transition metal oxide surface and adsorbs on metallic Cu and react with dissociated H on Cu.555,556 From a thermodynamic point of view, the comparison of the formic acid pathway and the CO pathway showed that the energy barrier for CO generation is lower than for formic acid production (50.46 kJ mol−1 < 166.31 kJ mol−1). Moreover, CO formation is an exothermic process while formic acid formation is endothermic (Fig. 28). These data allowed concluding that CO production is more favoured than formate generation. Nevertheless, HCO cannot exist because it is unstable and prone to decomposition back into CO and lead to the production and accumulation of CO which becomes the main CO2 hydrogenation product, implying a very limited contribution of RWGS to CH3OH formation. Recently, a reaction mechanism study over of Cu–ZnO–ZrO2-FER by DRIFTS revealed that methanol and DME were formed by CO2 direct hydrogenation rather than through a CO route.538 Carbonate, formate, and methoxy surface species were the main detected products of CO2 hydrogenation and no bands for adsorbed formyl or formaldehyde species were observed. A mechanism of methanol formation via the bidentate-formate species that underwent hydrogenation and DME formation via methanol dehydration and reaction of two surface methoxy groups was proposed (Scheme 53).

5.4.4 Pd and bimetallic catalytic systems for direct DME synthesis. 
Palladium catalysts have been commonly and widely used as hydrogenation catalysts and used for the direct CO2 hydrogenation into methanol due to numerous metal active sites for H2 dissociative adsorption and interfacial sites for CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation. In 2004, the preparation of bimetallic Pd–Cu catalysts allowed improving the DME yields and retarded the CO formation.550 The study of Pd-modified CuO–ZnO–Al2O3–ZrO2/HZSM-5 catalysts’ performance revealed that the enhancement of the catalytic activity was due to hydrogen spillover from metallic Pd to the closer metallic Cu (active component for methanol hydrogenation). Pd doping also improved Cu stabilization against oxidation by CO2. CO2 conversion and DME selectivity of 18.7 and 73.6% were achieved at 200 °C and 3 MPa (Table 5, entry 27).
Following these leads, the catalytic activity of PdZn alloy nanoparticles on TiO2 for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol was also explored.557,558 The catalytic performances of PdZn alloy nanoparticles onto the solid acid ZSM-5 via chemical vapor impregnation, and of the mixture of 5% PdZn/TiO2 + ZSM-5 for the DME production were compared.559 The catalytic performance of the physical mixture PdZn/TiO2-ZSM-5 showed to be superior and this result was attributed to blocking of Brønsted acid sites when PdZn was directly deposited on the zeolite surface. Therefore, 5% PdZn/TiO2 + ZSM-5 allowed reaching CO2 conversion of 11% and a DME selectivity of 32% at 270 °C and 2 MPa with a DME production of 0.030 kgDME kgcat−1 h−1 (Table 5, entry 31). Previously, hybrid catalysts consisting of deposited Cu–ZrO2 on Pd-decorated multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) material and mixed with HZSM-5 zeolites following different routes were also used for the synthesis of DME.510 The study revealed that the mixing method affected the final catalytic performance of the hybrid catalyst and the stepwise precipitation/slurry mixing showed to provide the optimum catalysts. The addition of Pd-decorated CNTs into the Cu–ZrO2/HZSM-5 catalyst modified slightly the apparent activation energy for CO2 hydrogenation, but enabled to increase the metal Cu exposed area, improving H2 and CO2 adsorption performance of the catalyst. Over the bi-functional Cu–ZrO2–PdCNT/HZSM-5 hybrid catalyst at 250 °C and 5.0 MPa, maximum 12.5% CO2 conversion, 51.8% DME selectivity and STYDME 0.579 gDME h−1 ghydr.catal−1 were achieved (Table 5, entry 32). Under these reaction conditions, the catalyst showed stabilized catalytic performance after 20 h of TOS, remaining stable for 200 h with CO2 conversion and DME selectivity around 7.5 and 75%, respectively.
Since CO2 obtained from combustion of sulfur-containing substances enclosed numerous sulfur compounds, catalysts for DME synthesis strongly adsorb sulfur compounds and suffer from strong poisoning. The Pd-catalysts can maintain good catalytic performance in the presence of sulfur species due to the formation of a Pd-electron-deficient state by transferring an outer electron, resulting in poor interactions between Pd and the electron-acceptor sulfur. Different factors can favour the Pd-electron-deficient state such as the acidity of the carrier surface,560 very small particle size of Pd and the presence of electron-withdrawing additives.561 Then, Pd/HZSM-5 bifunctional catalysts incorporating CeO2 and CaO were prepared by impregnation.562 The study showed that CaO incorporation enabled reducing the strong acidity and weakened the CO2 adsorption while the presence of CeO2 induced an increase in the moderate acidity and favoured weak adsorption of CO2. Therefore, CeO2–CaO–Pd/HZSM-5 exhibited very good catalytic activity, and stability versus sulfur poisoning and coke deposition. The best catalytic performance was obtained over 3 wt% CeO2–1 wt% CaO–Pd/HZSM-5 catalyst, with CO2 conversion and DME selectivity of 21% and 67% after 20 h of reaction (Table 5, entry 33).
5.4.5 Conclusion. 
Direct hydrogenation of CO2 in DME is an attractive route considering the environmental and economic issues involved. Efforts are being made to improve the hydrophobic and acid properties of the catalytic surface, and the Cu nanoparticle size and dispersion in order to optimize both methanol dehydration, and CO2 and H2 adsorption and activation, by controlling the zeolite structure and/or the Si/Al ratio, and/or by incorporating a transition metal. The results showed the importance to balance adequately the acidity of the surface to promote methanol dehydration over strong acid sites. Similarly, the importance of the distance between the two types of active sites, the metal sites for methanol synthesis and the acid sites for methanol dehydration, has been studied. The proximity between the two sites was shown to be crucial to minimize mass transfer restrictions and to improve the DME selectivity, being more convenient to integrate the two types of active sites in a single moiety. Nevertheless, the developed catalysts exhibit limited catalytic performance since low DME selectivity is usually achieved because of high CO production. Moreover, the catalysts suffer from drastic deactivation due to the large amount of water produced during the reaction. Fig. 29 and 30 illustrate the catalytic performance of the different zeolite-based catalysts reported and highlight the catalytic performance of La–Cu–ZnO–Al2O3/HZSM-5 and Cu–ZnO–Al2O3/HZSM-5 due to the good DME selectivity and productivity. However, the direct transformation of CO2 into DME needs further development to reach industrial application. Exhaustive studies taking into account the catalyst stability and regeneration step are required.

5.5 CO2 methanation. 
5.5.1 Introduction. 
Nowadays natural gas constitutes 24% of global primary energy consumption of fuel and it is the third fuel used for power generation, and the main one for heat generation in industry and households.563 Currently, methane can be obtained from natural wells with fossil origin, from purifying biogas obtained by fermentation of organic matter and from the synthetic gas route. In 2022, natural gas reserves account for ∼50 years of current production. In 1872, CO2 hydrogenation into methane was first discovered by applying an electric discharge to a CO/CO2/H2 mixture.564 At the beginning of the twentieth century, Sabatier developed a process to produce methane and water starting from CO2 and H2 in the presence of a heterogeneous nickel catalyst.565 Since then, CO2 hydrogenation or CO2 methanation, also called the “Sabatier reaction”, has been studied for more than 100 years. Nowadays, because of the increasing demand for natural gas and the reduction of greenhouse gases, the production of synthetic natural gas (SNG) constitutes an important future energy carrier due to its environmentally friendly nature and high calorific value (Fig. 31). Moreover, SNG can be stored and distributed easily thanks to its worldwide existing infrastructure consisting of storage facilities, filling stations, and pipeline networks.566–569 More importantly, CO2 methanation is one of the most promising strategies within the concept of power-to-gas. Indeed, the main problem found with renewable energy is to adapt the production and demand, as there are situations where the amount of energy produced is greater than the demand when there is for examples excess wind, sun or rain. Then the storage becomes expensive and finally ends up wasting it. Accordingly, the Power-to-Gas (P2G) process is an alternative to adjust this demand since it allows the transfer of excess electricity from renewables from the electricity grid to the natural gas grid. P2G involves the conversion of electricity into thermal energy in the form of methane, and is still an incipient technology. An overview of the production costs of synthetic methane in a P2G process has been recently reported.570 The production costs depend on three determining economic factors such as the price and market of electricity, the price and market of SNG and the market price of CO2 and the availability. It was so envisioned that with the future expected development of capital and operational expenditure, electricity prices and gas costs, a viable and economic production of synthetic natural gas for the years 2030, especially for 2050, is feasible. The CO2 methanation process requires H2 and for sustainability and environment considerations, H2 has to be green. Therefore, H2 is obtained from water splitting that requires electric energy produced from green and sustainable sources. Current electrolysis technologies at an industrial scale are alkaline electrolysis571 and proton exchange membrane electrolysis.572

5.5.2 Thermodynamics of CO2 methanation. 
Methanation for the production of SNG is a very complicated process and the thermodynamics of the process has to be considered for the evaluation of any proposed technology. Then, numerous studies of thermodynamic equilibrium calculations of complex chemical systems based on Gibbs free energy minimization have been reported, providing information such as the type of thermodynamically stable reaction products together with their selectivity and yield, heat transfer requirements (endothermic or exothermic process) and the impact of reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, or reactant ratios).573–575 CO2 methanation is known to be a highly exothermic reaction. However, it is difficult to achieve because of the high kinetic barriers of the eight-electron reduction process. The hydrogenation process starting from CO2 and H2 involves six possible products, CO2, CO, H2, CH4, H2O and C deposited through three independent reactions (Scheme 54). Moreover, CO2 methanation is a reversible reaction and the reverse process is the steam reforming of methane (eqn (4)).
 Scheme 54  Different CO2 hydrogenation processes. 
Based on these reactions, different studies513,576,577 concluded that a reaction temperature over 600 °C favours CO formation from the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) (eqn (3)) while CH4 formation is disfavoured and the C-deposits can be avoided to a great extent. Moreover, a H2/CO2 ratio increase revealed to have a positive effect on the production of CH4 and it has to be pointed out that carbon formation is not expected at a H2/CO2 ratio ≥ 4.573 At lower ratios significant carbon formation was observed even at 3 MPa. Then, a control of the H2/CO2 ratio and temperature is mandatory for the methanation process. From thermodynamic consideration, CO2 methanation should be performed at low temperatures (<300–350 °C), elevated pressure, and with a stoichiometric ratio of H2/CO2 = 4.578
Although catalytic CO2 methanation is thermodynamically favourable at low temperatures, because of kinetic limitation and high stability of CO2 molecules, high temperatures (200–750 °C) are normally required to enable CO2 methanation. To maximize the CH4 yield, the reaction system has to be maintained away from the region of thermodynamic equilibrium and reactions of eqn (2) and (3) have to be avoided. In addition, due to the high exothermicity, the development of local hotspots along the catalytic packed bed is responsible for catalyst sintering and deactivation.579 Therefore, the design and development of efficient and selective catalysts to methane formation coupled with an adequate reactor system is key and very challenging.
5.5.3 Catalysts for CO2 methanation. 
Since the discovery of Ni activity for CO2 methanation, numerous group VIIIB metals (Fe, Ru, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, and Pt)574,580–586 have been carefully investigated and Ni, Ru and Rh based catalysts revealed to be the most active for this process. Various strategies have been attempted to enhance the stability and activity of the catalyst. The oxygen mobility and basic properties of the support constitute key parameters. The effects of the support, metal loading and the incorporation of additives such as metals, metal oxides or alkali metals have been shown to enhance the stability and catalytic performance and modify the state of the active phase.577,587 The addition of a second metal can change the electronic and geometric structures of single-crystal metals,588 inducing different physical and chemical properties to the metal-active phase.
The specific activity and selectivity of different metals over alumina have been studied by different groups.589–591 In 1976,589 the order of activity of supported metals was as following: Ru ≫ Fe > Ni > Co > Rh > Pd > Pt > Ir, and selectivity order Pd > Pt > Ir > Ni > Rh > Co > Fe > Ru. Previously, a simplified classification was reported considering the most important metal methanation catalysts, Ru, Ni, Co, Fe and Mo. Therefore, activity was reported in the order Ru > Fe > Ni > Co > Mo and selectivity in the order Ni > Co > Fe > Ru. Within the CO2 methanation catalysts, the Ni based remain the most extensively studied catalysts587,592–598 due to their good activity for CO2 hydrogenation, high selectivity to methane, low cost and availability. However, Ni catalysts deactivate easily, even at low temperature, due to the sintering of Ni particles, formation of mobile nickel sub-carbonyls and carbon deposition599 that results in a fast deactivation of the catalyst, and constituting one of the most important problems in industry. After Ni, Rh has been the most investigated metal for CO2 methanation. The oxidation state of Rh574 and particle size, as well as the presence of promoters greatly influence its catalytic performance.600 Likewise, a study of the Rh content over TiO2 modified metal particle sizes revealed that at low temperatures (130–150 °C), the rate of CH4 production per surface Rh atoms increased when the metal particle size increases up to 7 nm.582 Ruthenium has been largely used and studied for CO2 methanation and can be even more active591,601–605 than Ni but it is considerably more expensive.606–608
(a) Mechanism of CO2 methanation. 
Several studies have proposed different mechanisms for CO2 methanation over different catalysts,577,609–612 and two main routes with CO or bicarbonate/formate as main intermediates have been considered (Fig. 32). The nature and composition of the catalyst active sites, more specifically the presence of acid/basic sites (density and strength), control and determine the formation and nature of the reaction intermediates. With respect to the CO2 dissociation mechanism, it is envisioned that CO2 adsorption occurs preferably at the metal–support interface while CO2 dissociation takes place on the active metal surface.613 Then, CO hydrogenation takes place in the same way as CO methanation. The other mechanisms involve the formation of oxygenated species, carbonates and further, formates, preferably in the presence of basic sites that enable the adsorption and activation of CO2.
 Fig. 32  Different mechanisms have been investigated based on CO intermediates, or formate (bicarbonate) intermediates. 
(b) Zeolite-based catalysts for CO2 methanation. 
Numerous studies and catalytic systems have been developed to perform CO2 methanation and the design and development of an efficient and selective catalyst, able to perform methanation at relatively low temperature to reduce the costs of the process, remain as the main challenges. The development of a successful zeolite based catalyst for CO2 methanation could be a new breakthrough in the zeolite field owing to zeolite robustness to work continuously for days under severe conditions (temperature, pressure and moisture).614,615 Indeed zeolites are well-known to present great stability under severe reaction conditions as evidenced by their use in the FCC industrial process.
Despite the existence of different hydrogenation metals reported for CO2 methanation, Ni remains the best choice when considering activity, selectivity and price. Interestingly, Ni constitutes practically the sole reported metal supported on zeolites for this application. In the literature, we could find one example of Fe catalyst where Fe/13X was studied as the candidate to substitute Ni catalysts at elevated pressure. A very high dispersion of Fe in octahedral sites within the zeolite is necessary for selectively performing the CO2 methanation process and to suppress the Fischer–Tropsch activity towards C–C coupling at elevated pressure. A low Fe loading (1 wt%) and high Fe dispersion were needed to reach high reaction rates with 76% CH4 selectivity and 82% CO2 conversion, at 300 °C and 10 bar (Table 6, entry 1).616

Nickel-based zeolite catalysts exhibit maximum CH4 selectivity but suffer from drastic deactivation due to water adsorption on active sites. Therefore, to comply with “Le Chatelier's principle” in situ removal of water from the reaction sites is required and the use of molecular sieves due to their adsorption properties should be beneficial. Accordingly, a recent study showed the importance of regeneration of the active sites of the catalyst (Table 6, entry 2).617 The catalytic performances of 5Ni/13X and 5Ni/5A samples were compared for alternated cyclic CO2 methanation and drying at 300 °C. Better catalytic performance of 5Ni/13X was demonstrated, which is attributed to its higher water adsorption capacity with the optimal catalyst regeneration by a simple drying step under an oxidizing (air) atmosphere which allowed the redispersion of the Ni nanoparticles618 and improved the catalyst stability.
Therefore, the development of a robust and successful zeolite-based catalyst is related to three key parameters which are hydrophobicity, nickel nanoparticle size and dispersion, and CO2 adsorption and activation.
In the literature, numerous works have reported the effect of compensating cation exchange on the basic properties of zeolite-based catalysts affecting the adsorption and activation of CO2, and also on the stabilization and dispersion of Ni nanoparticles that can be additionally modified by adding promoters, the effect of Si/Al ratio on the acid/base properties and the hydrophobicity, and the effect of the structure on the Ni stability and dispersion and also on the hydrophobicity inherent to each zeolite structure.
(i) Effect of Si/Al ratio of zeolite-based catalysts for CO2methanation. The Al framework content in zeolites allowed controlling the Brønsted acidity and hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the surface.58,619–621 Zeolites with enhanced hydrophobicity are obtained by increasing the framework Si/Al ratio and the number of silanols. For CO2 methanation, the hydrophobicity of the surface was shown to be of paramount importance due to the inhibitory effect for water adsorption.622,623 Recently, the catalytic performance of Ni-ITQ-2 and ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts with different aluminum contents624 revealed that the Al content is a more determinant factor than the structure of the zeolite. This is because of the lower water adsorption on the high Si/Al ratio zeolites that lowers the deactivation of the Ni components by water that reduces the CO2 surface coverage. Moreover, the high Si/Al ratio also improved the dispersion and stability of Ni nanoparticles as it was also described in a recent work.625 Comparison of the catalytic behavior of both zeolite structures showed higher activity for the pure silica ITQ-2 zeolite indicating the crucial effect of the aluminum content and its impact on the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the catalytic surface and nickel particle size and dispersion. 68% CO2 conversion and 99% CH4 selectivity were achieved at 350 °C (Table 6, entries 3 and 4). The results obtained with 5Ni/ITQ-2(Si/Al ∼ ∞) are comparable to those reported in the presence of Ni-zeolite with promoters such as La2O3626 or Ce.627,628 Previously, the beneficial effect of increasing the Si/Al ratio in Y zeolite on the catalytic behavior of 15%Ni–Y zeolite samples for CO2 methanation was shown (Table 6, entry 5).621 In the case of Y zeolite, a lower Al content obtained by dealumination was associated with the lower affinity of the zeolites to water and the presence of mesopores enabling higher dispersion of the Ni particles regardless of the compensating cation present in the zeolite and their lower basicity. Therefore, the hydrophobicity of the zeolites resulted in a more determinant factor than the basicity, which was previously reported as a parameter of importance for CO2 methanation.629 Indeed, the influence of the distribution of acidic/basic sites and Ni dispersion on the catalytic behaviors for CO2 methanation catalysts has been described as a key factor for the CO2 adsorption and activation. Following this direction, a study of the physicochemical properties of the Ni/Al2O3, Ni/SiO2 and Ni/Beta zeolite (Ni/Hβ40) revealed that even if the mesoporous Al2O3 enabled a higher dispersion of nickel species, this sample exhibited a lower catalytic activity than the Beta zeolite based catalyst. The distribution of basic sites was determined with CO2-TPD profiles showing different desorption peaks assigned to weak, medium and strong basic sites in the temperature range of 100–200 °C, 200–400 °C and 500–600 °C, respectively. Therefore, the Ni/Al2O3 sample mainly exhibited weak basic sites, the Ni/SiO2 sample exhibited mainly medium basic sites and the Ni/Hβ40 sample mainly presented medium-strong basic sites, leading to the basicity order Ni/Hβ40 > Ni/SiO2 > Ni/Al2O3, with the presence of basic sites being crucial for CO2 adsorption and activation (Fig. 33). The DRIFT study showed different reaction networks over the different samples that exhibit the same Ni content but different physicochemical properties such as a higher density of Lewis acid sites in the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst and higher density of medium-strong strength basic sites in the Ni/Hβ40 catalyst. Therefore, the Ni/Hβ40 catalyst characterized by optimum density of the medium to strong basic sites exhibited superior activity to Ni/SiO2 while Ni/Al2O3 did not show adequate catalytic properties for CO2 methanation. Practically 100% CH4 selectivity and 80% CO2 conversion were achieved at 300 °C in the presence of Ni/Hβ40 (Table 6, entry 6).612 These results showed the importance of suitable hydrophobic and basic properties for CO2 methanation for both water elimination of the catalytic surface and CO2 adsorption and activation, respectively, which could be achieved in zeolites by adjusting the Si/Al ratio and cation exchange.

(ii) Effect of the cations in exchanged zeolites for CO2methanation. The substitution of SiO4 with AlO4− tetrahedra in zeolite induces a negative charge that has to be compensated by exchangeable cations (H+, Na+, K+, Cs2+, and Ca2+). The amount, characteristic and properties of each cation determine the properties of the zeolites, such as acid/base properties612 and consequently affect the CO2 adsorption capacity.42,630–632 In addition, the nature of the compensating cation can influence the Ni metallic particles’ size and stability as well as the reducibility properties owing to electron donation from the alkali metal to nickel which is greater when the larger the ionic radius is.633 In this direction, a study of the effect of the environment of Ni particles demonstrated the influence of the size of the alkali metal cations since larger cations are able to inhibit the migration path of the nickel species and so to limit the metal sintering most efficiently than compensation cations with lower size.634 The effect of the nature of the compensating cation is greater when the lower the Ni content is, i.e. when Ni sintering is lower. Following this direction, a few years ago, a study of CO2 methanation using the USY zeolite exchanged with monovalent (Cs+, K+, Na+, and Li+) and divalent (Ba2+, Ca2+, Mg2+) cations and impregnated with 15% and 5% of Ni was carried out.621 The H2-TPR study demonstrated that the reducibility of Ni species was higher when bigger cations are present and the effect is greater for lower Ni content. This is so even if a similar amount of reduced Ni species was obtained (for the same Ni content) (Fig. 34), while similar Ni particles sizes were observed for monovalent cations and much bigger for the K+ sample. Therefore, the improvement of the catalytic performance with exchanged samples with monovalent alkaline cations was associated with the enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity and framework basicity of the exchanged zeolites. With respect to divalent alkaline earth cations, Mg2+ improved both CO2 activation and Ni dispersion. When a similar study was performed with the USY zeolite exchanged with alkali metals and impregnated with 5% of Ni, the authors reported enhancements of up to 200% in CO2 conversion and 300% in CH4 selectivity in the presence of the 5 wt% Ni/Cs-USY catalyst, at 450 °C (Table 6, entry 7).629

Soon after, a study comparing the catalytic performance of 10 wt% Ni-supported Y and BETA zeolites reported the same benefits of Na+ cation exchange that improved the CO2 conversion due to the reducibility enhancement of NiO (electron donation from Na+ to Ni) together with the improved CO2 adsorption owing to the generation of weak basic sites in Na-based catalysts. Various and distinct Ni species were formed in both Ni/Na-BETA and Ni/Na-Y due to differences in their structure involving different nickel locations with different reducibility. Besides, similar CO2 methanation activity was obtained for both Ni/Na-Y and Ni/Na-Beta catalysts attributed to a similar available surface of active phase during CO2 methanation. In the presence of Ni/Na-BETA catalyst 73% CO2 conversion and 71% CH4 yield were reached at 350 °C (Table 6, entry 8).27
(iii) Effect of topology and morphology structure of zeolite-based catalysts for CO2methanation. The zeolite topology not only influences the reaction pathway and product distribution, but it is also crucial to the diffusion and adsorption/deposition of metallic precursors into the channels leading to different nickel locations (NiO on the external surface, Ni2+ pseudo-tetrahedrally, tetrahedrally and octahedrelly coordinated). Indeed the different voids and microenvironments defined by the zeolite topologies are responsible for stabilization and dispersion of metallic active sites.48,51,87,539,635 A recent work reported the effect of the zeolite framework type on the catalytic performances of Ni-based catalysts (15 wt%) using commercial USY, BEA, ZSM-5 and MOR zeolites with the Si/Al ratio close to 40 and ion-exchanged with Na+ or Cs+.636 The zeolites exhibited different particle sizes, and the BEA sample had the smallest particle size, and the intercrystalline space of the BEA sample was responsible for the formation of mesoporosity. TEM analysis revealed that USY, ZSM-5 and MOR samples exhibit similar Ni0 particles sizes, while the BEA exhibited higher dispersion and smallest Ni0 particles. Even if the zeolites presented a similar Si/Al ratio, their H+ exchange capacities were different, leading to distinct alkali and alkali earth compensating cation contents and so diverse CO2 adsorption capacities as follows: USY < BEA < ZSM-5 < MOR. The H2-TPR study demonstrated similar reducibility for USY and BEA samples with a greater amount of NiO reduced at T > 500 °C, probably due to NiO located in mesopores, and similar reducibility for MOR and ZSM-5 samples with NiO particles mainly located on the external surface. Since the hydrophobicity was established as paramount importance to shift the equilibrium and to avoid the deactivation of active sites, the hydrophobicity index was calculated for the different zeolites and followed the order: USY > MOR > BEA ≈ ZSM-5. Besides these characterization data, the catalytic performances followed the order: 15%Ni/Na-USY > 15%Ni/Na-BEA > 15%Ni/Na-ZSM-5 ≈ 15%Ni/Na-MOR. Thus, taking into account that Ni0 particles size, CO2 adsorption capacity and hydrophobicity are considered key parameters for the design of an efficient zeolite-based catalyst and the catalytic activity order, the authors concluded that the mandatory parameter is the hydrophobicity. When zeolite samples were Cs+ exchanged, an increase in the hydrophobicity index for BEA, ZSM-5 and MOR samples was observed as reported in the literature,637 while it remained the same for the USY sample. Regarding H2-TPR profiles, there were not considerable changes when comparing Cs+ and Na+ exchanged samples. However, the Cs+ exchanged sample favoured Ni0 dispersion owing to its ability to inhibit the migration path of the nickel species and to suppress the metal agglomeration as commented above. Thus, the dispersion of Ni0 particles followed the order BEA > MOR > USY > ZSM-5, while the catalytic activity of the exchanged sample followed the order 15Ni/Cs-USY > 15%Ni/Cs-BEA ≈ 15%Ni/Cs-MOR > 15% > Ni/Cs-ZSM-5. Since the characterization data did not allow supporting the activity order, the authors attributed the best catalytic performance of the USY sample to more favourable metal/support interaction inherent to the zeolite structure. Additionally, a characterization study of textural properties and the catalytic performance of a BEA sample with Si/Al = 243 was performed. The results showed an improvement of the catalytic activity attributed to its higher hydrophobicity despite presenting larger Ni0 particles and almost reaching the results obtained in the presence of the USY catalyst.636 Thus, in the presence of Ni/NaUSY and Ni/NaBEA catalysts, 70–71% CO2 conversion and 95–96% CH4 selectivity, at 375–400 °C, were achieved (Fig. 35 and Table 6, entries 9 and 10). These results revealed the importance of the metal/support interaction inherent to zeolite morphology over their catalytic performance.

A previous study compared the use of different micro- and mesoporous supports (ZSM-5, SBA-15, MCM-41, Al2O3 and SiO2) to prepare Ni-based catalysts. The CO2 adsorption study evidenced that the incorporation of Ni onto different supports induced the formation of new basic sites. Ni/ZSM-5 presented an optimum amount of weak and medium basic sites able to absorb and activate CO2 molecules while stronger basic sites present in Ni/SBA-15 and Ni/SiO2 are not suitable to activate CO2 molecules and enable methanation.638 Among the prepared catalysts, the Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst displayed higher catalytic activity and no deactivation was observed up to 100 h, attributed to the basic properties and higher nickel dispersion (Table 6, entries 11–13).597
(iv) Preparation strategies of zeolite-based catalysts for CO2methanation. Different strategies for the preparation and reduction of the CO2 methanation catalysts have been studied in order to optimize the dispersion and stabilization of Ni particles. Ni-based USY zeolites have been largely studied and used as CO2 methanation catalysts. USY zeolite, due to ultra-stabilization treatments, is characterized by good stability under CO2 methanation conditions, i.e. temperature and presence of water, and offers opportunities as support. Then, the effect of the preparation method and the Ni content on the catalytic performance of Ni-based USY catalysts has been studied. Generally, higher metal loadings led to better catalytic performance, due to a higher availability and amount of Ni active sites.639 The comparison of catalytic behaviors revealed that Ni and Ce supported NaUSY zeolites prepared by impregnation exhibited higher catalytic performance than samples prepared by ion-exchanged Ni species due to easier reducibility of the NiO species.639 Besides the effects of the drying method after impregnation, the calcination and the reduction temperature on the catalytic performance of Ni-based USY catalysts showed that CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity could be maximized by optimizing the preparation and pre-reduction conditions.640 Likewise, the calcination temperature influenced the reducibility and location of the Ni species and particle size after reduction. Therefore, at higher calcination temperatures, NiO located on the external surface was the main Ni species, while at 300 °C Ni2+ species octahedrally coordinated were the main Ni species. Moreover, an increase in the calcination temperature induced a decrease in the amount of Ni reducible species, an increase in reduction temperatures of Ni species, and the formation of larger Ni particles (Fig. 36).

The pre-reduction temperature also affected the catalytic activity and was dependent on the Ni content, since at lower Ni content (5 wt%), the higher reduction temperature required (>550 °C) induced sintering, while for higher Ni content (14 wt%) no effect of the reduction temperature was observed. Therefore, in the presence of 14 wt% Ni/USY calcined at 500 °C and reduced at 600 °C, maximum 95% CO2 conversion and 70% CH4 selectivity were achieved at 400 °C (Table 6, entry 14).
The influence of the Ni precursors for the preparation Ni-Zeolite 13X and 5A catalysts was studied and the results showed that the use of nickel citrate and acetate resulted in a smaller NiO particle size compared to nitrate. STEM-EDX results indicate that all the Ni-precursor complexes diffuse more efficiently in the 13X than in the 5A zeolite structure because of the steric hindrance induced by the smaller pore size of the zeolite 5A. The best catalytic performance was achieved using 5%Ni–13X catalysts synthesized with nickel citrate. 79% CO2 conversion at 320 °C and 100% CH4 selectivity for 200 h were achieved (Table 6, entries 15 and 16).641 A X zeolite synthesized from waste fly ashes coming from the energy sector was also used as support to prepare Ni-based methanation catalysts (Ni/X zeoliteashes), and exhibited relatively lower catalytic performance in comparison to other published Ni-catalysts prepared with commercial zeolites (USY and Beta), because of the formation of unreduced Ni species due to remaining fly ash components such as MgO and Al2O3. At 450 °C, 49% CO2 conversion and 96% CH4 selectivity were achieved in the presence of 10 wt% Ni/X zeolite (Table 6, entry 17).642
A hydrothermal synthesis method was also followed for the preparation of an active and stable 10 wt% Ni@HZSM-5 catalyst starting from the Ni/SiO2 catalyst as the silicone source.643 In addition to the superior catalytic performance to that of the 10 wt% Ni/ZSM-5 sample prepared by impregnation, the 10 wt% Ni@HZSM-5 catalyst retained a similar nickel content and structure after use due to its special embedded structure. Good and stable 66.2% CO2 conversion and 99.8% CH4 selectivity at 400 °C, 0.1 MPa, for 40 h, were achieved (Table 6, entries 18 and 19). A desilication method was also reported to prepare a Ni-desilicated silicalite zeolite (5 wt%/d-S1) with intra-particle voids and mesopores enabling higher Ni dispersion inside the channels and smaller Ni particles by the impregnation method. The 5 wt% Ni/d-S1 material exhibited higher catalytic performance than the pristine sample and a relevant increase of CH4 selectivity and stability. At 450 °C, 61–64% CO2 conversion and 95–97% CH4 selectivity were maintained for 50 h (Table 6, entry 20). In the presence of a 5 wt% Ni/S1 catalyst, 42% CO2 conversion and 40% CH4 selectivity were initially reached, though a drastic decrease in CH4 selectivity was observed after 10 h of TOS.644
To overcome the mass transfer and diffusion limitations of zeolites for bulky molecules, hierarchical zeolites containing a secondary pore system or nanocrystalline zeolites have been prepared. More recently, the synthesis of a mesoporous material with uniform mesopore diameters and crystalline MFI zeolite walls has been described as a new alternative. Therefore, an amine functionalized mesoporous MFI nanosponge zeolite (AF-NSZ) was used as the support for the regioselective precipitation of the Ni species in the mesoporous channels resulting in highly dispersed and stabilized Ni nanoparticles.626 Good catalytic performance was achieved with a 15 wt% Ni/AF-NSZ mesoporous MFI nanosponge, with 78% CO2 conversion and 99% CH4 selectivity at 400 °C, 0.1 MPa, for 50 h (Table 6, entry 21). Despite the efforts spent to improve the dispersion and stabilization of Ni nanoparticles by modifying Ni deposition and by using zeolite-based materials with mesoporosity, the catalytic performance exhibited by these advanced catalysts does not outperform the results achieved in the presence of more conventional Ni/USY zeolite catalysts (Table 6, entry 5).
(v) Addition of promoter to the zeolite-based catalysts for CO2methanation. For CO2 methanation, CO2 activation is considered the rate-determining step645–648 and the development of the low temperature CO2 methanation process requires suitable and efficient CO2 adsorption and activation. The presence of additives such as metals, metal oxides, alkali metals and rare earth oxides has been shown not only to enhance CO2 activation at lower temperatures but also to improve the stability and catalytic performance, and modify the state of the active phase.577,587,649–651 Among CO2 methanation catalysts, cerium oxide and mixed oxide based catalysts have exhibited the best catalytic performance575,587,652–654 due to the suitable physicochemical properties of CeO2 for CO2 adsorption and activation, and oxygen mobility.655 The remarkable ability of CeO2 is due to the presence of oxygen vacancies that allow the storage and release of oxygen,225,656 also promoting the high dispersion and activity of supported noble-metal due to strong metal–support bonding.657 Comparison of the catalytic behavior revealed that Ni and Ce supported NaUSY zeolites prepared by impregnation exhibited higher catalytic performance than samples prepared by ion-exchanged Ni species due to the easier reducibility of the NiO species in the samples prepared by impregnation.639 Meantime, the Ce incorporation into the Ni-USY zeolite enhanced the catalyst activity and selectivity. At 400 °C, in the presence of 14%NiUSY and 5%Ni15%CeUSY catalysts, 65.5 and 68.3% CH4 selectivity, and 94.2 and 95.1% CO2 conversion, respectively, were achieved (Table 6, entries 24 and 25). The study of the effect of the order of Ce and Ni incorporation in USY zeolites indicated that stronger interactions between Ni and Ce species occurred when Ni was incorporated after or simultaneously, with an enhanced reducibility of the Ni species and a decrease in the Ni0 particle size. In contrast, the CO2 adsorption capacity decreased when Ce was incorporated before Ni. Therefore, co-impregnation was determined as the best preparation method (Table 6, entry 26).628 The incorporation of La2O3 and MgO in nickel mesoporous MFI nanosponge zeolite allowed modifying the surface basicity and promoting CO2 adsorption and the methanation process. The amine functionalization of the mesoporous MFI nanosponge zeolite (AF-NSZ) enabled the regioselective precipitation of the Ni precursor in the mesoporous channels resulting in highly dispersed and stabilized Ni nanoparticles (Table 6, entries 27–29).626 Therefore, La2O3 and MgO promoted Ni/AF-NSZ samples (15Ni–5La/AF-NSZ and 15Ni–5Mg/AF-NSZ) exhibited higher catalytic activity than the pristine 15Ni/AF-NSZ catalyst, at lower temperature (280 °C), due to higher CO2 adsorption and activation. Following the same leads, the addition of La2O3 to 10Ni/Na-BETA helped in increasing and optimizing the amount of CO2 adsorption sites and hydrogenation active sites resulting in an increase of the methanation process. In the presence of 10Ni–10La2O3/Na-BETA at 400 °C, maximum 82% CO2 conversion and 97% CH4 selectivity were achieved. At 350 °C, 65% CO2 conversion at 350 °C and 99% CH4 selectivity were maintained for 24 h (Table 6, entries 30–32).27
Owing to the high activity of Ru for CO2 methanation, especially at lower temperatures, the addition of Ru to Ni catalysts may be beneficial to enhance CO2 methanation.611 Accordingly, the effect of addition of Ru on the catalytic performance of Ni/13X and Ni/5A catalysts was explored. The catalytic performance of mono and bimetallic Ru and Ni 13X and 5A and the physicochemical characterization results showed that both zeolite structures remained unchanged after Ni, Ru addition. Nevertheless, only good metal dispersion was obtained for Ni into the pores of 13X owing to the improved diffusion of the Ni precursor while metal dispersion was worse for the bimetallic catalysts. The best results were obtained for the catalysts exhibiting a lower amount of weak acid sites. Thus, in the presence of monometallic 2.5%Ru13X and 5%Ni13X catalysts, good catalytic activity and stability were maintained at 360 °C, for 200 h with 97% CH4 selectivity (Table 6, entries 33 and 34).658 It was then concluded that the incorporation of Ru did not allow improving the catalytic performance of Ni catalysts.
(vi) Mechanistic studies of CO2methanation over zeolite-based catalysts. The CO2 methanation mechanism has been the target of numerous studies and two main pathways can be considered with CO and formate being the main intermediates (Fig. 39).577,609–612,647 The physicochemical properties of the catalysts are decisive since the nature and strength of acid and basic sites, and the presence of oxygen vacancies play a determinant role in the CO2 adsorption and activation, and influence the reaction pathway. The CO2 methanation process involves CO2 adsorption and activation over active sites (Fig. 37 and 38), preferably, basic sites. Over mixed oxides, the presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface constitutes decisive reactive sites for CO2 activation and formate formation as it was reported on Ru/CeO2 (Fig. 37).659 As mentioned above, CO2 hydrogenation involves adsorbed oxygenated species such as monodendate carbonates and formates while H2 activation and dissociation takes place over Ni0 nanoparticles.613 The oxygenated species are so converted into formyl and methoxy species finally hydrogenated into CH4. In Ni/USY660,661 and Ru/Al2O3 samples,647 due to the lack of basic sites and/or oxygen vacancies, CO2 methanation goes through monodendate formate dissociation over Ni particles and the formation of adsorbed CO which is later converted into CH4.660,662 Therefore, under methanation conditions, dissociated hydrogen reacts with physisorbed carbonates and/or CO2, giving rise to monodentate formates, then to carbonyls adsorbed on Ni0 particles and, finally, to methane (Fig. 38).

 Fig. 39  Different mechanisms involved in CO2 methanation over Ni/USY and Ce–Ni/USY catalysts. 
Studies in the absence of H2 revealed that CO2 was not adsorbed over acidic zeolite while in the presence of H2, formates and carbonyl species were identified.660 The results led us to conclude that the CO2 hydrogenation mechanism did not undergo carbonate formation as an intermediate step, but rather passed through the formate dissociation step leading, at low temperatures, to the formation of adsorbed CO and in a minor extension to methane. Therefore, in the absence of basic sites, CO seems to be the “true” intermediate in the CO2 methanation reaction. Moreover, CO dissociation/hydrogenation was confirmed to be the rate-determining step.660 In the same way, a proposed four-step reaction mechanism involving the carbonyl pathway and the cleavage of CO bonds from CO2 as the rate-determining step was reported over Ni(19 wt%)/MCM-41.663 The addition of promoters, and especially CeO2, allowed improving the activity and selectivity of Ni-based USY catalysts. A mechanistic study by in situ IR spectroscopy over the Ce–Ni/USY catalyst revealed that hydrogen dissociated on Ni0 particles reacted with hydrogen and bidentate carbonates, leading to the formation of monodentate formates, and then to CH4.664 The different mechanisms involved in CO2 methanation over the different Ni/USY catalysts are depicted in Fig. 39.
Recently, the catalytic activity of bimetallic Ni–Mo/SiO2 catalysts for CO2 methanation was investigated. Characterization data revealed that the incorporation of Mo improves the dispersion of Ni through strong metal/metal interaction and was optimum for Ni/Mo = 1, preventing CO adsorption at room temperature. Then, the catalytic study through the product composition indicated that CO2 methanation undergoes RWGS and CO methanation. The Mo content plays a key role over the catalytic pathway since the high Mo content favours CO desorption and limits CO hydrogenation because of the presence of smaller Ni ensembles and reduced accessibility to Ni0 active sites as a result of MoOx coverage. Therefore, for the Ni/Mo ratio close to 1, RWGS is the main process while a low Mo content (Ni/Mo = 0.1) favours CO2 and CO activation promoting CO methanation. Therefore, at 400 °C, 25–30% CO2 conversion controlled by thermodynamic equilibrium of the RWGS reaction with 100% CH4 selectivity was achieved.665
(vii) Plasma assisted CO2methanation. Plasma is a superheated matter wherein electrons are ripped away from the atoms to form an ionized gas. Heating a gas will form plasma, generally named the fourth state of the matter together with the solid, liquid and gas, occurring naturally in nebulas, stars, auroras, sun and through artificial lights (neons). The properties of plasma have been explored and used by the scientific community for application in different fields such as alternative to the thermocatalytic process and especially for reactions that require high energy consumption due to thermodynamic limitations. Indeed, non-thermal plasma (NTP) and thermal assisted plasma systems offer attractive opportunities and have been tested for various processes. In NTP, electrons are highly energetic with a very high electron temperature of 10000–100000 °C (1–10 eV),666 while the gas temperature is close to room temperature. Therefore, the impact of high energy electrons is enough to breakdown bonds and produce free radicals, excited atoms, ions and molecules.667 The non-equilibrium character of the plasma system aids in overcoming the barrier energy and thermodynamic limitations at low temperatures in chemical processes such as CO2 conversions.668–670 There exist different types of NTP such as dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), corona discharge, glow discharge or gliding arcs. Among them, DBD constitutes a versatile method with some advantages such as uniform distribution of micro-discharges, high-energy electrons and operability under ambient conditions. When an alternative current (AC voltage) is applied to one or both electrodes formed by two metal plates and covered by an insulator, a discharge is produced (dielectric barrier discharge plasma (DBD)). When an excessive and rapid discharge is suppressed by the insulator, this discharge does not produce an arc but bright purple plasma (Fig. 40). Dielectric barrier discharge plasma is one of the most popular methods to generate non thermal plasma (NTP) comprising a host of high-energy electrons, free radicals, chemically active ions and excited species, promoting chemical reactions. The big potential of NTPs to promote reactions under mild conditions is of great interest,666 and few examples of CO2 methanation under NTP at temperature <200 °C have been reported.

The activity of Ni-based zeolite catalysts has been also studied under non-thermal plasma-assisted conditions, and a mechanism of plasma-assisted CO2 hydrogenation was studied by operando time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy over Ni-HUSY (Fig. 41).662 CO was detected as the main product of the reaction, produced from CO2 dissociation in the gas phase, and CH4 was observed as a secondary product. The same authors performed CO2 hydrogenation using a packed-bed catalytic reactor under two different configurations, in-plasma catalysis (IPC) and post-plasma catalysis and showed that, CH4 production took place only when CO2 hydrogenation was performed in IPC mode, only when the catalyst could directly interact with plasma discharges.671 Thereafter, the effect of Si/Al ratio and Ce addition on the performances of Ni supported Cs-USY samples in DBD plasma-assisted catalysis showed that the hydrophobicity of the surface improved the CO2 conversion while the addition of Ce favoured the formation of additional sites for CO2 adsorption and activation. Therefore, in the presence of NiCe/Cs-USY, with a power supply of 25 W, 75% CH4 yield was achieved (Table 6, entries 35 and 36).627 NTP assisted catalytic CO2 methanation over Ni catalysts (15 wt%) supported on BETA zeolite doped with La as the promoter exhibited great catalytic performance for CO2 methanation.579 The Na+ exchange in the H-BETA zeolite enabled improving the CO2 conversion by a two-fold increase (65%) and fourfold TOF values at 6.0 kV, while the addition of La allowed reaching a maximum of 85% CO2 conversion and 97% CH4 with excellent stability for 15 h (Table 6, entries 33 and 34).

(c) OMS-based catalysts for CO2 methanation. 
Metal supported on mesoporous molecular sieves such as MCM-41 have been receiving more and more attention as a new type of nanostructured (OMS) material.598,672,673 Different parameters have been studied to improve the catalytic properties, robustness and stability of Ni zeolite-based catalysts for CO2 methanation such as the variation of the Si/Al ratio to optimize the adsorption properties (hydrophobicity), the zeolite structure to control the diffusion and adsorption/deposition of metal precursors, the Nickel dispersion and location, the addition of noble metals and/or transition metals to enhance the reducibility and dispersion of Ni by changing the electronic and geometric structure of single crystal-metals, or cation exchange with alkali and alkaline earth metals to create basic sites and enhance the adsorption and activation of CO2. Thus, OMS based catalysts owing to the high surface area and controllable pore size should allow the diffusion of metal precursors inside the pores and the establishment of favourable metal/support interaction for controlling the nanoparticle size, dispersion and stability to prevent Ni particle sintering. However, despite the opportunities that OMS-based catalysts may offer, few studies using OMS based catalysts for CO2 methanation have been published.
A series of Ni/MCM-41 catalysts were prepared using different Ni precipitation agents and used as catalysts for CO2 methanation. AP-XPS and in situ DRIFTS studies revealed the presence of carbonyl intermediates and, the co-existence of NiO and Ni0 species with a cooperative effect for the adsorption/activation and dissociation of CO2 and H2 molecules, respectively (Fig. 42). A proposed four-step reaction mechanism involving the carbonyl pathway and the cleavage of CO bonds from CO2 as the rate-determining step was reported. In the presence of Ni(19 wt%)/MCM-41, 73.2% CO2 conversion and 91.6% CH4 selectivity, at 400 °C, were obtained and remained stable for 150 h (Table 6, entry 37).663

CeO2 has been shown to effectively promote the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules on the catalysts674,675 Moreover, CeO2 has a great oxygen exchange capacity that allows reversible release and restore of oxygen atoms. Thus, within a certain loading range, it was shown that the addition of CeO2 improved the catalytic performance of Ni/MCM-41. Indeed, the incorporation of CeO2 allowed the stabilization of Ni species, with higher dispersion and reduction of Ni species, whereas excess of CeO2 induced Ni coverage and a decrease in the catalytic performance (Fig. 43). Thus, Ni–20CeO2/MCM-41 showed the best catalytic performance, with 85.6% CO2 conversion and 99.8% CH4 selectivity at 380 °C, which remained constant for 30 h (Table 6, entries 38 and 39).676

The catalytic performances of Ni-mesoporous SBA-15 and MCM-41 with and without CeO2 as the promoter were also compared. The H2-TPR study showed two main peaks at T < 500 °C and T > 500 °C mainly attributed to NiO species weakly interacting with the support, mainly located on the external surface, and strongly interacting with the support, respectively. The higher reduction temperature was also attributed to the smaller Ni0 particle size and support-dependent, since the larger pores allow for enhanced diffusion of the metal precursor and accommodate metal species with better metal dispersions.677 On the other hand, the incorporation order, Ce after Ni, affected the reducibility of NiO because of reduced accessibility. Despite bigger Ni particles and mainly located on the external surface, ascribed to smaller pores compared to Ni/SBA-15, Ni/MCM-41 exhibited highest conversion and TOF values, attributed to a lower amount of non-reactive carbonyl species poisoning Ni0 and to the support-dependent electronic properties of Ni (stronger metal/support interactions). However, at high temperature (400 °C) the both Ni supported catalysts exhibited similar catalytic performance (Table 6, entries 40–43).678
5.5.4 Conclusion. 
Among the CO2 hydrogenation reactions, CO2 methanation is the most favoured reaction from a thermodynamic point of view.679 However, the development of new catalysts able to perform the CO2 methanation reaction at lower temperature is still required. The activation of CO2 is of paramount importance to achieve high methanation activity at lower reaction temperature, and the oxygen mobility and basic properties (strength, number) of the support are key parameters to enhance the adsorption and activation of CO2. Therefore, the improvement of metal dispersion and reducibility by the addition of promoters, the control of basic properties by cation exchange, the preparation method and the reduction conditions allow optimizing the catalytic performance of CO2 methanation catalysts. Moreover, the hydrophobicity of the catalyst surface is of paramount importance to limit the water adsorption and avoid the water inhibitory effect on CO2 adsorption (Fig. 44). Then, the zeolite framework composition was found to affect strongly the zeolite-based catalyst activity due to important changes in the catalyst–CO2 and catalyst–H2O interactions. Among the different based-zeolite and OMS catalysts reported, USY based catalysts could present great potential due to the improved stability provided by post synthesis treatments and strong metal/support interaction. For future strategies, it should be particularly important to focus on the morphology of the carrier to improve dispersion, physical isolation and protection of metal species, and mass transfer and also to avoid pore blockage due to coke formation. Therefore, new strategies will consider the use of OMS materials, hierarchical zeolites, two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets and core–shell materials to promote the amount, dispersion and stabilization of active centers and mass transfer. Moreover, for a better understanding of the active species, the mechanism of the activation and cleavage of C–O (CO2), and of the H2 activation, and the determination of reaction intermediates, computational modeling and in situ spectroscopy studies should be fundamental tools for the rational design of efficient and stable catalysts for methanation. From a commercial point of view and industrial applicability, several catalytic processes and reactor technology are available and should be translated to CO2 methanation since at laboratory scale, high conversion and CH4 selectivity close to 100% are achieved. However, the viability for large scale CO2 fixation also depends on ready availability and price of CO2 and H2 produced from waste and/or renewable sources in order to a develop sustainable process, based on heat produced from renewable (sun, wind) or by nuclear energy to move towards zero carbon footprint.

5.6 Hydrogenation of CO2 into higher alcohols (C2+OH). 
5.6.1 Introduction. 
Higher alcohols (C2–4) present higher energy density, lower vapor pressure, and lower affinity for water than methanol and so constitute an alternative for fuel and fuel additives.680–682 Additionally, C2+OH finds applications as solvents and as platform molecules for the synthesis of intermediates for the production of chemicals and fine chemicals (Fig. 45).683,684 Currently, ethanol and isobutanol are mainly produced by fermentation that is expensive due to difficult distillation and low throughput.685–688 Other alcohols are traditionally obtained by hydration of the corresponding petroleum-derived olefins.689,690 Thus, new sustainable routes of synthesis of C2+OH using a renewable source and green energy are of great interest and the CO2 hydrogenation, although is very challengeable, offers great opportunities, as well as for mitigating CO2 emissions. Since the beginning of the 19th century, the synthesis of higher alcohols (HAS) from syngas has been studied in the presence of Rh- and Mo-based catalysts, and modified Fischer–Tropsch synthesis or methanol synthesis catalysts. From mechanistic standpoints, the HAS can be considered as a combination of Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) and methanol synthesis (MS) pathways. FTS has been defined as a surface polymerization, following a carbide-based reaction pathway where the CO dissociative adsorption produces C species subsequently hydrogenated into alkylmonomers which undergo coupling forming hydrocarbons (HCs) (Fig. 46a).689,691,692 However, this reaction pathway makes this surface polymerization process different as the adding group may be a fragment, rather than a complete molecule, and the growing chain may also have to undergo further reactions before the addition of the next fragment is possible. During MS, CO is adsorbed and hydrogenated to methanol (Fig. 46b). HAS requires that both FTS and MS processes occur closely to produce new alcohols: the alkyl species  formed by FTS should couple with adsorbed CO* to give rise to CHyCO* (CxHzCO*), which, after subsequent hydrogenation, yields alcohol (Fig. 46c).

Studies on HAS starting from CO2 began in the 1980s, with the studies focusing on the nature of active species and elucidation of the reaction mechanism for the development of efficient catalysts. Rh-, Cu-, Mo-, and Co-based catalysts have been mainly developed for CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH even if some works reported the activity of Pt, Ru and Pd-based catalysts.681 Modified catalysts used for FTS and MS have also been used but exhibited still low activity and selectivity under harsh reaction conditions.
Hydrogenation of CO2 to C2+OH is an exothermic reaction similar to methanol synthesis and it is a more complex process because it involves C–C coupling, carbon chain growth and termination (Scheme 55). Different mechanistic pathways have been reported in the literature, involving first the activation and CO2 hydrogenation to C1 intermediates such as CHxO, CO, and CHx.693,694 The posterior coupling C1–CHx leads to C2+ intermediates which are further hydrogenated to produce C2 hydrocarbons and oxygenates in which the nature of the catalytic active species plays a determinant role. For example, the CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol over Cu nanoparticle active centers shaped and confined into the Na-Beta zeolite framework681 described the CO2 hydrogenation to via CH3OH* at the Cu surface with subsequent coupling  to provide CH3COO* easily hydrogenated on the catalyst surface to ethanol. On the other hand, the synthesis of C2+OH has also been reported as a combination of RWGS with the CO2 dissociation into CO* and O*, and the CO* coupling with  and/or hydrogenation (Fig. 47).682,695 The reaction mechanism requires a precise match (Fig. 47) between dissociative CO bond activation, to generate CO and , and non-dissociative C–O bonds to promote chain growth and the alcohol production (Scheme 55) and not alkanes. These results showed that the reported mechanism was highly dependent on the catalysts.

An efficient catalyst should have multiple active sites for controlling every reaction step over the catalyst surface for CO dissociative adsorption, CO non-dissociative adsorption, C–C bond formation and chain growth for CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH. Further computational and mechanistic studies are still needed to clarify operando the nature of the intermediates and catalytic active species to design new efficient and selective catalysts.
5.6.2 Zeolite based catalysts for hydrogenation of CO2 to C2+OH. 
(a) Rh-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH. 
Rh-based catalysts with promoters have been widely studied for the C2+OH synthesis from syngas, since in the presence of Rh catalysts without modification the main products are CH4 or CO. Moreover, Rh is one of the main metals used for the development of CO2 hydrogenation catalysts to higher alcohols. The ability of Rh for catalyzing both CO dissociation and CO insertion lies in the presence of adjacent Rh0–Rhn+ species related to the metal surface modification by the support and/or the presence of promoters (Li, Fe, and Co), which allows the formation of C2 oxygenates (ethanol, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid).697–702 The addition of promoters due to the electronic effect induces electronic state modification of Rh, changes the bonding mode and leads to bridge-bonded CO species favouring its breaking. Rh-supported on metal oxides modified with alkaline and alkaline earth metals or transition metals led to maximum 4.91% of C2+OH yield in the presence of the RhFeLi/TiO2 catalyst, at 250 °C, 3 MPa, GHSV = 6000 mL g−1 h−1 and CO2/H2 ratio of 1/3.693 This data indicates that hydrogenation of CO2 to C2+OH is still very challenging.
(i) Alkali cation effect in zeolite based catalysts for CO2hydrogenation to C2+OH. Alkaline metals are electron-donors due to their relatively low electronegativity, and their ability to easily release electrons to more electronegative atoms. The presence of alkaline metals leads to higher electron density on Rh, promoting an electron back-donation CO intermediates-Rh, contributing to stronger Rh–CO bonds, leading to higher activation and/or stabilization of CO. Moreover, the addition of alkali metals can block the active sites and modify the hydrogenation activity, decreasing the alkane yield. Additionally, the presence of alkali metals can allow the formation of new active species promoting the C2+OH synthesis. The adsorption mode of CO can be also modified, and the adsorption of linear versus bridged (tilted) CO has been described, favouring C–O breaking, and lowering H2 adsorption due to higher coverage surface by CO. Accordingly, the presence of Li in supported Rh catalysts was reported for CO hydrogenation to promote acetic acid703 formation, and for CO2 hydrogenation to promote ethanol formation.704 In fact, the effect of Li addition to RhY zeolite catalysts (RhY), prepared by an ion-exchange method, for CO2 hydrogenation has been explored.461 The study of the Li/Rh ratio effect revealed that as the ratio increased, the methane selectivity decreased, while the CO selectivity, in contrast, increased with the simultaneous promoted production of methanol and ethanol. Then, for a Li/Rh ratio of 10, maximum CO selectivity of 87%, promoted ethanol selectivity of ∼1.5%, and a minimum methane selectivity of 8.4% were achieved, while the total CO2 conversion decreased from ∼92% to ∼52%, at 250 °C, 3 MPa, with a CO2/H2 ratio of 1/3, and GHSV = 6000 mL g−1 h−1. When 1.8% of CO was added to the CO2 + H2, the ethanol selectivity increased up to 13%. The authors concluded that two Rh active sites existed, no-modified metal centers with reactive adsorbed CO species and Li-modified Rh active sites (Rhb), that promoted CO2 adsorption and conversion into stable adsorbed CO species. Thus, the added gas-phase CO was expected to act as a source of , preferentially adsorbed and hydrogenated on the unmodified Rh centers (Rha). Thus, stable adsorbed CO* and  formed acyl groups which were subsequently hydrogenated to ethanol (Fig. 48).
 Fig. 48  Proposed mechanism for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol via CO2 hydrogenation into CO* and  followed by  coupling over differentiated Rh active centers confined in Li–Rh/Y zeolite.461 
(ii) Metal confinement effect in zeolite-based catalysts for CO2hydrogenation to C2+OH. In order to improve the metal sintering resistance, in the last few decades, new synthesis methods have been developed to prepare metal species embedded in zeolite crystals to obtain new materials with unique catalytic properties denoted as metal@zeolite (Fig. 49).540,705–707 The interaction between the metal species and the zeolite framework can modify the geometric and electronic structures of the subnanometric metal species and confer new catalytic features. Additionally, these advanced materials owing to the confinement effect can undergo shape-selective catalysis for reactant and product diffusion, reaction and stabilization, in contrast to traditionally supported metal nanoparticles.

Accordingly, the catalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation of Rh nanoparticles embedded in Na-zeolite S-1 (Na–Rh@S-1) by a ligand-protected crystallization method, with ∼0.75 wt% Rh content and variable Na content in the range of 0.13–0.26 wt% has been reported (Fig. 50).695 The study of Na content revealed that an optimum content of close to 0.19 wt% existed, and that Na favours the coexistence of Rh0 and Rh+ pair species. Moreover, a DRIFT study supported the hypothesis that Rh0 and Rh+ pair is crucial for the formation of ethanol, since it participates in the insertion or coupling of adsorbed CO and CHx species (Fig. 51). The non-dissociative C–O character of Rh+ allowed converting CO2 into CO* and HCOO* subsequently hydrogenated to methanol, while Rh0 sites allowed dissociating CO* and its further hydrogenation into . Finally, the  coupling promoted by the Rh0 and Rh+ pair leads to ethanol. Therefore, in the presence of the 0.19Na–Rh@S-1 catalyst, 10% CO2 conversion and 24% C2H5OH selectivity were achieved, with a space-time yield (STYC2H5OH) around 72 mmol gRh−1 h−1, at 250 °C, with a H2/CO2 ratio of 3, 5 MPa and GHSV = 6000 mL g−1 h−1. Over the Rh@S-1 catalyst, 2.9% CO2 conversion was achieved while the main product was CH4 with a small amount of CH3OH. The authors concluded that both the Na+ modification of Rh sites (Rh0 and Rh+ pair species) and the confinement effect allowed shifting the nature of reaction products from methane to C2+OH.

(b) Cu-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH. 
Cu-based catalytic performances have been largely explored and demonstrated for methanol synthesis and RWGS, and Cu is one of the main metals studied for the development of CO2 hydrogenation catalysts to produce higher alcohols. In the presence of the CuZnFeK catalyst, highest 13.5% higher alcohol yield has been achieved, at 300 °C, with a H2/CO2 ratio of 3, 6 MPa and GHSV = 5000 mL g−1 h−1.708 Accordingly, the high-performance of Cu@Na-Beta for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol with 100% selectivity on the organic product basis in a fixed bed has been recently reported. A two-step preparation method using dry gel conversion and a crystallization procedure allowed preparing Cu@Na-Beta consisting of CuO nanoparticles (2–5 nm) embedded in crystalline particles Na-Beta zeolites, with an EtOH space-time yield of 398 mg−1 gcat−1 h−1, at 300 °C, 1.3 MPa, with GHSV = 12 L gcat−1 h−1 and a CO2/H2 ratio of 1/3.709 Characterization and theoretical studies allowed showing that specific interaction between Beta zeolite structures with enclosed copper was responsible for the superior catalytic performance of Cu@Na-Beta for CO2 hydrogenation to ethanol.
A comparison study of characterization data and catalytic activity of Cu-impregnated Na-Beta zeolite (Cu/Na-Beta), Cu-impregnated silica (Cu/SiO2), and Cu-embedded Na-ZSM-5 following the same procedure (Cu@Na-ZSM-5) was performed to clarify the catalytic mechanism and explain the superior catalytic performance of Cu@Na-Beta. The XAFS study revealed a similar Cu crystal structure for all the samples that could not explain the significant differences in the catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation, while the XPS study showed the presence of a small amount of electropositive Cu species only for the Cu@Na-Beta sample, probably due to specific metal/support interaction. For mechanistic insights, GC-MS monitoring for transient experiments with H2/12CO2 switching by H2/13CO2 was performed over Cu@Na-Beta and revealed a synchronous change in the 12CH313CH2OH signal, indicating the ready coupling of 13CO2 with adsorbed methyl species . Additionally, density functional and slab model calculations allowed determining that the (221) facet of copper was the most effective for CO2 hydrogenation into ethanol and selected to mimic the catalyst with three models (perfect, Cu vacancies, and O-doped surfaces on the edges). The barrier/reaction heat calculated for a kinetically favourable route of methyl formation  indicated that  formation by C–O breaking from CH3OH was easier than by CH3O* decomposition into . Moreover, the calculation of energy reaction for the coupling  into CH3COO* revealed that this step was slightly endothermic while methyl formation from methanol, and CH3COO* reduction to CH3CH2OH were exothermic reactions. These findings are consistent with the non-detection of methanol, acetic acid and formic acid as reaction products. Therefore, the authors concluded that CO2 was first hydrogenated to  at the Cu-surface that subsequently reacted with adsorbed  to form CH3COO* that cannot desorb due to the high-energy barrier but further easily hydrogenated into ethanol. Two roles were attributed to the zeolitic Na-Beta framework that allowed, on the one hand, the confinement of Cu nanoparticles with unique shapes and surface active sites for CO2 hydrogenation, and on the other hand, to impose shape constraints to the reactants in the near-surface layer of the nanoparticles to avoid the formation of by-products.
5.6.3 OMS-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH. 
As mentioned above, the development of Rh-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation is promising due to the ability of the Rh active sites to dissociate CO together with the fact that CH4 or CO is the main product over the pure Rh catalyst. These abilities open up the possibility of combining both dissociative/non-dissociative capabilities by incorporating promoters, thus balancing the number of dissociative and non-dissociative metal centers to promote  coupling. Accordingly, different Rh-MOx/MCM-41 catalysts where MOx was WOx, FeOx, MnOx, CeOx and NbOx were prepared by the co-impregnation method and used for CO2 hydrogenation, in a fixed bed at 250 °C, 3.0 MPa, GHSV = 6000 h−1 and a H2/CO2/N2 ratio of 3:1:1.710 Since the VOx promoted catalyst exhibited the highest ethanol selectivity and yield, the characterization of VOx and the effect of VOx loading were studied. When VOx loading increased, the CO2 conversion and ethanol selectivity increased and reached a maximum of up to 12 and 24%, respectively, for 0.3 wt% VOx. However, a further increase in VOx loading induced a decrease in CO2 conversion, attributed to the passive effect caused by the excessive encapsulation of Rh species by VOx species. The authors concluded that the incorporation of VOx owing to the electronic effect induced the formation of Rh+ (VOx-Rh interfacial active sites) that modified the dissociation capacity of the catalyst due to the presence of tilted CO species leading to the easy cleavage of C–O and its subsequent hydrogenation to form . The higher ethanol yield was the result of the promoted CO2 activation and CO dissociation for an adequate VOx loading. Thus, at 0.3 wt% VOx, the amount of dissociative adsorbed CO is similar to that of non-dissociative adsorbed CO, leading to the highest selectivity and ethanol yield.
5.6.4 Conclusion. 
CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH is an attractive process to obtain new building block molecules (olefins from alcohol dehydration) and energy carriers since C2+OH has higher energy densities, and lower toxicity and corrosiveness than methanol. But, if CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH has been widely studied in the last decades, very few studies focusing on the development of hydrogenation catalysts based on zeolites or OMS have been reported besides the benefits of confinement effect, nanoparticle stabilization by electronic features and shape-selectivity (reactant, product, and transition state). Accordingly, if the best yield for heterogeneous catalysts has been achieved over the RhFeLi/TiO2 catalyst with 4.91% C2+OH yield, maximum 100% ethanol selectivity on the organic product basis has been reached over the Cu@Na-Beta catalyst.
However, high yield and selectivity of C2+OH remain a major challenge and could be achieved by ab initio design of the catalysts, introducing the necessary active sites, which can be rationalized and simulated by computational chemistry. Therefore, additional thorough mechanistic studies, based on operando analysis and characterization of the catalysts, reactants, products and intermediates are required to understand the reaction pathways and the nature of active sites to generate fundamental knowledge. Thus, the selectivity could be improved towards selected alcohol (C2–4), controlling the nature and number of active sites with dissociative, non-dissociative and propagation chain abilities. Actually, up to now, different mechanisms based on products, by-products and intermediate formations detected by DRIFT studies have been proposed and are highly dependent on the catalyst. Moreover, the cost and stability of the catalyst has to be optimized, and the metal choice is of paramount importance. In the case of the few reported works for OMS and zeolite based catalysts, both Cu and Rh exhibited high abilities for CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH, nevertheless, considering catalyst costs, Cu seems more indicated for industrial application. It is clear that zeolites and OMS based catalysts are good candidates for the development of selective and stable catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH, and which have so far been under-considered.


5.7 Hydrogenation of CO2 to C2+. 
5.7.1 Introduction. 
The production of hydrocarbons, aromatics, and olefins via catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 is an attractive route to produce fuels (C2+) and pave the way to CO2 circularity. In comparison to C1 products, C2+ products possess higher energy densities. Light olefins such as ethylene, propylene, and butylene are the top-produced petrochemicals worldwide and constitute important raw materials for the chemical industry and the production of plastics, fibers, and chemicals. They are generally produced through the hydrocracking of hydrocarbons of fossil sources under high temperature. Aromatics also constitute important platform chemicals for the synthesis of petrochemicals, polymers, and medicines. They are usually produced by oil thermal cracking and naphtha reforming. The alternative strategy to produce gasoline, olefins and aromatics from CO2 is an important way to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, develop new sustainable routes for the production of value-added chemicals and reduce dependence on fossil sources (Fig. 52).
 Fig. 52  Hydrogenation of CO2 to C2+ and uses. 
The production of C2+ from CO2 hydrogenation involves a cascade process consisting of a first step of production of CO intermediates by RWGS or MeOH (DME), followed by Fisher Tropsch synthesis (FTS) or methanol to hydrocarbon route (MTH), respectively, comprising oligomerization, cracking and aromatization reactions (Scheme 56).
 Scheme 56  CO2 hydrogenation to liquid fuels, olefins and aromatics by the modified FTS or methanol mediated route. 
The main drawback for C2+ hydrocarbon production is the kinetic barriers for C–C coupling. Therefore, the great advantage of combining RWGS with FTS or methanol synthesis and conversion to hydrocarbons is the thermodynamics of the overall process.88,711
RWGS is an endothermic process, whereas the FTS reaction is exothermic, which makes the RWGS-FTS tandem thermodynamically favorable (Scheme 56). Thus, the equilibrium of the RWGS reaction can be shifted due to the consumption of CO by the FTS for hydrocarbon production. Similarly, for the methanol-mediated route, the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol is exothermic and thermodynamically limited at high temperature, and kinetically limited at low temperature. However, the combination of methanol synthesis with conversion to hydrocarbons allows shifting the equilibrium due to methanol consumption.
Different catalysts (metals, metal oxides, metal carbides, MOFs, and zeolites) that have been applied for the synthesis of hydrocarbons from synthesis gas or methanol to olefins or aromatics (MTO/MTA) have also been tested for the hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons via the tandem process. Different strategies have been followed to optimize the catalytic properties and reaction conditions to enhance CO2 activation, decrease the energy barrier for C–C coupling and minimize the CO and methane yields. Therefore, the effects of the addition of alkali promoters, addition of iron to enhance CO2 adsorption and increase the surface CO/H2 ratio, addition of a second metal to improve strong interactions between the support and active phase and modify the electronic environment of active species, the modification of acid–base properties, for example to weaken the secondary hydrogenation ability of olefins or to avoid undesirable alkylation and isomerization have been explored.
Usually, hydrogenation of CO2 over Fe and Co based catalysts produces CO as the intermediates while over Cu/Zn catalysts methanol is the main intermediate. Only Fe, Co, Ni, and Ru of group VIII exhibit sufficiently high activities for the hydrogenation of CO to warrant their use as effective FT catalysts and among them, only Co- and Fe-based catalysts may be considered as practical FT catalysts, while Fe-based catalysts remain the preferred for commercial FT synthesis.712
The synthesis of C2+ products through the CO2 hydrogenation process is a combination of MeOH or CO production in a first step, in the presence of a multi-center metal-based catalyst, and of a second step involving oligomerization, cracking and aromatization processes in which the zeolite-based catalysts have played a key role. In the literature, recent reviews described the catalytic performance of metal-based solid catalysts, and zeolites owing to their unique and tunable properties have been widely applied for both their carrier and chemical properties.82,83,85–87 The combination of zeolites and metal sites in the presence of metal nanoparticles or metallic oxides offers great opportunities for the conversion of CO2 into liquid fuels, olefins and aromatics. The presence of targeted metal active species allows the activation and conversion of CO2 to intermediate CO or methanol (DME), while zeolites, due to their tunable acidity and pore structure, allow controlling and directing the nature and distribution of the products, as illustrated in Fig. 53. Accordingly the combination of NaFe2O3, ZSM-5 and SAPO-11 with defined pores and acidic sites is responsible for enhancing the isomerization activity and improving the composition of isoparaffins for direct CO2 hydrogenation (Fig. 54).713

Since excellent and comprehensive reviews80,82–84 reported the recent advances in the direct CO2 hydrogenation to liquid fuels, olefins and aromatics this section describes the major achievements and proposes some future research approaches.
5.7.2 Direct hydrogenation of CO2 to fuels over bifunctional catalytic systems incorporating zeolites.. 
(a) Direct hydrogenation of CO2via modified FTS. 
The direct hydrogenation of CO2via modified FTS produces a mixture of hydrocarbons with broad distributions that can be adjusted by optimizing the morphology and structure of FT catalysts by controlling the metal active species (nanoparticle size, crystalline phase and exposed facets) and the properties of the zeolite (acidity, pore size and structure) and the addition of promoters. Accordingly, zeolites have shown to exhibit high activity for hydrocracking and isomerization of hydrocarbons and have been widely used.714,715
The direct hydrogenation of CO2via modified FTS involves the hydrogenation of CO2 to CO via the RWGS reaction, followed by hydrogenation of CO to hydrocarbons by FT synthesis. The most active catalysts reported for RWGS are Fe-based being Fe3O4 the active phase, while iron carbide (Fe5C2) have been reported as the most active catalysts for FT synthesis.716–718
Therefore, the main challenge is controlling the chain growth via C–C coupling on metal surfaces. The FTS products have been ascribed to the polymerization reaction and thus product distribution is determined by the Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF) distribution. According to the ASF model, the molar fraction (Mn) of a hydrocarbon product with a carbon number of n depends on the chain growth probability (α), which is given by the following equation: Mn = (1 − α)αn−1 where α is determined by the rates of chain growth (rp) and chain termination (rt), α = rp/(rp + rt).82,712 The modification of the catalyst composition and structure plays a key role in the chain growth value and in turn in the hydrocarbon product distribution (Fig. 55). However, the selectivity for specific hydrocarbons C2+ range is limited, and maximum 58%, 48%, 41% and 40% selectivities for C2–C4, C5–C11, C12–C20 and C21+ were predicted, respectively.

A recent study revealed the high catalytic performance of the multifunctional Na–Fe3O4/H-ZSM-5 catalyst for the CO2 reduction to C5–C11 (gasoline) with total hydrocarbon selectivity of up to 78%, low 4% methane selectivity at 22% CO2 conversion, with H2/CO2 = 3, at 320 °C, 3 MPa and WHSV = 4 L h−1 gcat−1 (Table 7, entry 1).719 The cooperation of the three types of active sites properly spaced, Fe3O4 (to catalyze RWGS), Fe5C2 (to catalyze FTS) and acid sites (to catalyze oligomerization, isomerization and aromatization), allowed catalytic conversion of CO2 to gasoline through cascade reactions (Fig. 56). Moreover, the multifunctional catalyst exhibited stable activity for 1000 h on TOS. These results showed the potential of the catalytic system based on zeolite for industrial application for the CO2 conversion to liquid fuels.

Another study showed the effect of the pore size and structure over the isoparaffin/aromatic ratio in the gasoline-range hydrocarbons (Fig. 57). The catalytic performance of the catalytic system based on the MFI structure, with different Si/Al ratios, in the presence of Na–Fe3O4/HZSM-5(27), Na–Fe3O4/HZSM-5(160) and Na–Fe3O4/HZSM-5(300) produced a higher amount of aromatics (up to 61% of aromatics), while when the process was carried out over Na–Fe3O4/HMCM-22 (MWW structure), isoparaffins were the main hydrocarbon products (46% of isoparaffins). This last result was attributed to 10 MR pore openings with a lamellar structure consisting of two independent pore systems of the MWW structure with demonstrated catalytic properties for isomerization, alkylation and disproportionation.720 Additionally, a study of the adequate distance of the different active sites showed the effects over the selectivity of hydrocarbon products. When Na–Fe3O4 and HZSM-5 powders were mixed, the closest proximity of iron-based sites and acid sites led to the acid site poisoning by Na. However, when Na–Fe3O4 and HZSM-5 were combined by granule mixing, the adequate distance between iron-based and zeolite acid sites allowed the formation of olefin intermediates on iron-based sites and its diffusion through the pores of the zeolite towards the acid sites, where oligomerization, isomerization and aromatization reactions occurred. Therefore, maximum 73% C5–C11 selectivity at 34% CO2 conversion was achieved. Nevertheless, when the hydrogenation process was carried out in the dual-bed configuration with HZSM-5 packed below Na–Fe3O4 and separated by a thin layer of inert quartz sand, lower 67% C5–C11 selectivity (67%) at 34% CO2 conversion were reached and attributed to the larger distance of active sites.

A recent work demonstrated the critical role of the structure and pore size of the zeolite over isoparaffin selectivity.713 Indeed, the combination of SAPO-11 and ZSM-5 with Na/Fe3O4 catalysts allowed enhancing the long-chain-hydrocarbon selectivity by performing oligomerization on the shorter chains, while the isomerization ability favored long-chain hydrocracking along with aromatization (Fig. 58). A further study of configuration of the different catalysts showed that the triple-bed system with first the Na/Fe3O4 catalyst followed sequentially by SAPO-11 and ZSM-5 allowed maximizing isoparaffin selectivity. Likewise, 71.7% gasoline selectivity was achieved with 38.2% isoparaffin selectivity, at a CO2 conversion of 31.2% (Fig. 58; Table 7, entry 2).

(b) Direct hydrogenation of CO2via the methanol mediated route. 
Direct hydrogenation of CO2via the methanol mediated route was performed over a bifunctional catalyst constituted by reducible In2O3 and H-ZSM-5, reaching high 78.6% gasoline-range (C5+) and low 1% methane selectivity, at 13.1% CO2 conversion.721 Since direct hydrogenation of CO2via the methanol mediated route usually occurs over Cu/Zn catalysts,434,527 the catalytic performance of In2O3/H-ZSM-5 was compared to that of Cu–Zn–Al/H-ZSM-5 and Cu–Zn–Al–Zr/H-ZSM-5 bifunctional catalysts. When typical Cu–Zn–Al/H-ZSM-5 and Cu–Zn–Al–Zr/H-ZSM-5 catalysts were used, the main product was CO with higher CH4 selectivity in the hydrocarbon distribution, similarly to other reported studies combining Cu–Zn, Cu–Zn–Zr and Cu–Zn–Cr oxides with zeolite (HY, H-Beta, SAPO-5, and SAPO-44).722,723 The high activity of In2O3 for the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol was previously reported,724 and the combination of In2O3 with H-ZSM-5 allowed reaching a high C5+ hydrocarbons yield and selectivity (Fig. 59), at 340 °C, with H2/CO2 = 3 and 3.0 MPa, with good catalytic stability along 150 h of TOS. These results were attributed to the higher stability of intermediates involved in the CH3OH synthesis on the defective In2O3 surface with surface oxygen vacancies than on the Cu surface which strongly suppressed the formation of CO.723 On the other hand, the catalytic performance of the In2O3/H-ZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst was higher than one of other reducible metal oxides combined with H-ZSM-5 such as Ga2O3, Fe2O3, ZnO–Cr2O3 and ZnO–ZrO2 combined with a higher activity and C5+ selectivity (Table 7, entries 3–7).

A hydrocarbon-pool mechanism was proposed for methanol conversion into hydrocarbons inside HZSM-5. First, CO2 is hydrogenated into methanol at the oxygen vacancies on the In2O3 surface. Methanol further diffused inside the pore of the zeolite at the acidic site where it is transformed to hydrocarbons after oligomerization, isomerization and aromatization reactions (Fig. 60).

A study of integration manner of the active components revealed, as was observed in other works, that the hydrocarbon selectivity and distribution depended on the distance of the different active sites. When the hydrogenation process was performed in a dual-bed configuration, with HZSM-5 packed above the In2O3, a high methane selectivity of 66.3% was achieved. However, when In2O3 was packed above and HZSM-5, methanol was completely converted into hydrocarbons with 70.4% C5+ selectivity and 4.5% methane selectivity. Finally, a closer disposition of the active sites allowed suppressing undesired RWGS and maximized C5+ (78.6%).
Finally, experiments using the pellet catalyst were performed to show that tail-gas recycling, commonly used in industry for a more efficient utilization of the feed, allowed further improving the catalytic performance, with an increase of both CO2 conversion from 8.7 to 18.2% and C5+ selectivity from 78.6 to 84.1%, while CO selectivity decreased from 44.5 to 30%. These results showed the great potential of bifunctional catalysts based on zeolite for industrial applications.
5.7.3 Direct hydrogenation of CO2 to olefins over the bifunctional catalytic system incorporating zeolites via the methanol mediated route. 
The catalytic performance of ZnO-ZrO2/SAPO-34 bifunctional catalysts with high selectivity for the syngas conversion to lower olefins have been explored for the hydrogenation of CO2 to lower olefins (Table 8, entry 1).723 80% C2–C4 olefin selectivity was achieved with a low 3% methane selectivity at 12.6% CO2 conversion, at 380 °C, 2 MPa and H2/CO2 = 3. The comparison of the catalytic performances for CO2 hydrogenation of ZnO–ZrO2 and ZnO–ZrO2/SAPO-34 allowed concluding that hydrogenation over a tandem catalyst was not a simple sum of the two individual reactions but rather, a coupling reaction.725 Thus, if thermodynamics of CO2 hydrogenation is unfavorable, the conversion of methanol to lower olefins is thermodynamically favorable as well as the global process due to the coupling of both reactions. CO2 and H2 molecules were activated on ZnZrO, while the C–C coupling occurred on SAPO. Tandem catalysis improved thermodynamics and kinetics coupling through the transferring and migrating of the CHxO intermediate species, not methanol, which promoted the efficient conversion of CO2 to lower olefins (Fig. 61).

Recently, the effect of the proximity of the different active sites of the tandem catalyst on the catalytic performance was demonstrated when the CO2 hydrogenation was carried out with both catalysts integrated in different configurations: in a dual-fixed bed or physical mixtures of metal oxides and SAPO-34 powders or granules and with or without quartz sand as the separator. Optimum catalytic results were obtained for physical mixtures of metal oxides and SAPO-34 powders offering a suitable distance between the different active sites to perform tandem catalysis.
Similarly, the catalytic performance of the bifunctional catalyst In2O3–ZrO2/SAPO-34 was explored due to the high catalytic activity of In2O3724 for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol.726 A lower olefin selectivity of 80% with only 4% methane selectivity was achieved with hydrocarbon product distribution different from classical ASF distribution (Table 8, entry 2). The bifunctional catalyst exhibited good stability of over 150 h of TOS, opening up opportunities for industrial applications.
A bifunctional ZnGa2O4/SAPO-34 catalyst, ZnGa2O4 with a spinel structure, was also explored for the hydrogenation of CO2 to lower olefins.727 A lower olefin selectivity of 86%, at 13% CO2 conversion with 1% methane selectivity was achieved (Table 8, entry 3). A study of correlation of the rates of formation of CH3OH/DME (Zn–Ga–O) and lower olefins (C=2–C=4) (Zn–Ga–O/SAPO-34) with the density of oxygen vacancies demonstrated their fundamental role in the activation and selective conversion of CO2 to methanol/DME on the Zn–Ga–O surfaces and their subsequent transformation at the acid sites of SAPO to lower olefins (Fig. 62). On the other hand, the in situ IR study allowed to propose a mechanism for the activation of H2 on the –Ga–O– and –Zn–O-pairs and formation of H species (H*) for the conversion of CO2 to CH3O* species further converted to methanol and DME which after diffusion through the SAPO-34 pores towards the acid sites selectively form lower olefins.

5.7.4 Direct hydrogenation of CO2 to aromatics over the bifunctional catalytic system incorporating zeolites. 
(a) Direct hydrogenation of CO2 to aromatics via the methanol mediated route. 
The selective hydrogenation of CO2 to gasoline and olefins has been successfully explored and achieved. Nevertheless, the selective hydrogenation of CO2 to aromatics remains challenging due to the high unsaturation degree and complex structures of aromatics.
Recently, an attempt of conversion of CO2 to aromatics in the presence of a bifunctional catalyst comprising nano-scaled spinel structural ZnAlOx and H-ZSM-5 was reported.728 A characterization study was performed to determine the active sites and the combination mode of both catalysts. The TPR results showed that both ZnAlOx and ZnO can be hardly reduced by H2 below 430 °C and 7% less zinc oxides could be reduced above 730 °C. Therefore, it was concluded that Zn2+ is responsible for the activation of CO2 hydrogenation. The IR study of absorption of DTBPy (2,6-di-tert-butyl-pyridine absorption) to investigate the external surface Brønsted acid sites that are able to catalyze the hydrogenation of CO2 to paraffins and not to aromatics revealed that the characteristic bands at 3365, 1614 and 1531 cm−1 disappeared after mixing, grinding and pressing under high pressure with ZnAlOx. These results indicate that the external Brønsted acids of H-ZSM-5 are blocked by ZnAlOx after mixing, which is beneficial for the aromatization process, and which was demonstrated by the catalytic performance recorded with different combinations of both ZnAlOx and H-ZMSM-5 catalysts (Fig. 63). The aromatics or C2–4 olefin selectivity follows the order ZnAlOx&H-ZSM-5 > ZnAlOx + H-ZSM-5 > ZnAlOx/H-ZSM-5, in contrast to C2–4 paraffin selectivity that follows the opposite order. Therefore, when CO2 hydrogenation was performed over ZnAlOx&H-ZSM-5 a high aromatics selectivity of 73.9% with low 0.4% methane selectivity was achieved. Among aromatics, a selectivity of 58.1% is achieved for p-xylene, while CO selectivity was 57.4% (Table 9, entry 1). The proposed mechanism involves the formation of methanol and dimethyl ether by hydrogenation of formate species formed on the ZnAlOx surface, which diffuse to H-ZSM-5 at acid sites where they are successively converted to olefins and aromatics.

Although good catalytic performance has been reported for the hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons, especially, the methanol-mediated route allows achieving high aromatic selectivity within the hydrocarbon products in the presence of bifunctional catalysts composed of metal oxides and acid zeolites, the CO selectivity is still too high.
ZnO–ZrO2/H-ZSM-5 bifunctional catalysts that have exhibited high catalytic performance to convert selectively syngas to aromatics80,729 have also been explored for the direct hydrogenation of CO2 to aromatics. Accordingly, recently, the catalytic performance of a composite consisting of ZnZrOx and chain-like nanocrystal HZSM-5 was explored.730 A series of novel HZSM-5 nanocrystal clusters with chain-like morphology and chain length ranging from 0.16 to 1.41 μm were prepared through the incorporation of different amounts of n-octyltrimethoxysilane. The samples were denoted according to their chainlike morphology length Z5-0.16, Z5-0.21, Z5-0.73, and Z5-1.41. When the CO2 hydrogenation was carried out over the ZnZrOx the main products were methanol (53.8%) and CO (41.5%). The use of physical mixtures of ZnZrOx/HZSM-5 zeolites allowed the formation of aromatics with selectivity up to 75% (Fig. 64). Moreover, the passivation of external surface acid sites of HZSM-5 (with TPAOH) together with the b-axis length allowed enhancing the p-xylene selectivity up to 28.9%, while shortening the length of b-axis favored tetramethylbenzene (TeMB) production with 74.1% selectivity (Table 9, entry 2). The characterization study showed that CO2 activation at the surface oxygen vacancies of ZnZrOx enable the hydrogenation to CHxO species (formate, formaldehyde, methoxy, and methanol), which are further transformed into aromatics at the acid sites of HZSM-5. A high aromatic selectivity of 76% at 17.5% CO2 conversion, with a lower CO selectivity of 23.8% over the ZnZrOx/HZSM-5 were achieved owing to the directional component distribution in the bifunctional catalyst (Fig. 65). These results showed that the control of the morphology and the location of the active sites allowed directing the selectivity of the reaction towards the desired products.

Previously, direct CO2 conversion was carried out over the ZnZrO/ZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst. Tandem catalysis is thermodynamically favorable and enables the selective formation of aromatics through the coupling of CO2 hydrogenation over ZnZrO to CHxO species and aromatics formation over H-ZSM-5. A high aromatic selectivity of 70–73% at 9–14% CO2 conversion was reached and the CO selectivity was lowered to 42–44% (Table 9, entries 3 and 4).731,732
The main drawback of the direct conversion of CO2 to aromatics is the high CO selectivity (>40%) produced by the RWGS reaction. Therefore, an attempt to increase the oxygen vacancy content has been recently considered in order to promote CO2 activation and hydrogenation into stable intermediate species and lower RWGS.733 Indium oxide has been shown to contribute to the formation of vacancy-rich Zn5In2O8 oxide734 that in turn could contribute to the formation of stable methanol intermediate species. Thus, a series of highly efficient bifunctional catalysts consisting of physical mixtures of InZnZrOx solid solution and nano-ZSM-5 zeolite were used as bifunctional catalysts to convert CO2 into aromatics. A high aromatic selectivity of 90.6% at 13.8% CO2 conversion was achieved with a low 19.8% CO selectivity. These results were attributed to the formation of a high amount of oxygen vacancies on InZnZrOx surfaces, which directly improve the CO2 activation and the formation of CHxO intermediates, to the synergistic effect of hydrogenation and acid properties of InZnZrOx and H-ZSM-5, respectively, together with the improved mass transfer properties of nanostructured ZSM-5 zeolite for further conversion to aromatics (Table 9, entry 5).
The conversion of syngas to p-xylene has also been successfully performed over a hybrid catalyst, consisting of ZnCr2O4 spinel and core–shell structured zeolite.735 Accordingly, the direct conversion of CO2 to aromatics has been checked over a bifunctional catalyst composed of Cr2O3 and H-ZSM-5 zeolite.736 A high aromatic selectivity of 76% with 11.4% CO selectivity was achieved at 34.5% CO2 conversion over the bifunctional Cr2O3/H-ZSM-5 catalyst that exhibited a high TOS of over 100 h (Table 9, entry 6).736 A study of the effects of the proximity of the different types of active sites revealed that conversion of CO2 to aromatics was optimum for the closest proximity between Cr2O3 and ZSM-5 (Fig. 66, mode a). A prolonged distance between the oxide and zeolite (modes b and c) was prejudicial for the formation of aromatics. A further modification of the zeolite catalyst to passivate the external acid site allowed enhancing the selectivity towards BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) avoiding undesirable alkylation and isomerization. For this, a core–shell structured zeolite capsule catalyst was fabricated using H-ZSM-5 as the core and neutral silicalite-1 (S-1) as the shell. Thus, a higher BTX selectivity of 43.6% and PX selectivity of 25.3% were achieved over the Cr2O3/H-ZSM-5@S-1 catalyst (Fig. 67).

A similar strategy was followed to prepare a bifunctional catalyst based on core–shell structured Zn-doped HZSM-5 (Zn-ZSM-5@SiO2) and a Cr2O3 oxide.737 A control of the acidity of Zn-ZSM-5@SiO2 allowed improving the para-xylene selectivity up to 38.7% at 22.1% CO2 conversion (Table 9, entries 7 and 8).
More recently, an efficient solvent-free method was reported for the preparation of a capsule-like zeolite catalyst (HZSM-5@silicalite-1-S) for the selective hydrogenation of CO2 to para-xylene. A study of the effects of the configuration modes of Na–FeMn and HZSM-5@S1-S core–shell zeolite over the catalytic performances was performed.738 The best catalytic performance was achieved for the granule-mixing 2.83Na–FeMn (90/10) and HZSM-5@S1-S zeolite without quartz stand, with 17% aromatic selectivity and 75.4% para-xylene (among xylenes). This was attributed to the efficient mass transfer of intermediates to the micropores of HZSM-5@S1. After optimization of the Na–FeMn and HZSM-5@S1-S ratio (1/2), maximum 81.1% para-xylene (among xylenes) was achieved, which was higher than ones achieved over above described core–shell zeolite (HZSM-5@SiO2 and HZSM-5@S-1-S) (Fig. 68 and Table 9, entry 9).

(b) Direct hydrogenation of CO2 to aromatics via modified FTS. 
Iron-based catalysts have been widely studied for the catalytic conversion of CO2via modified FTS due to its properties to catalyze both the RWGS and FTS reactions.739,740 Under working reaction conditions, iron based catalysts exhibit Fe3O4 active sites for RWGS and Fe5C2 active sites for FTS.741 Moreover, the addition of alkali metals such as K and Na allowed improving the effectiveness of iron catalysts owing to improved surface carburization and weakened secondary hydrogenation ability of olefins.742 On the other hand, the addition of Zn allowed promoting FTS, catalyst stability and light olefin selectivity owing to the formation of the ZnFe2O4 spinel phase and the ZnO phase, which induced an increase of the surface area, improved the Fe–Zn interaction, and modified the redox and adsorption properties.743 Combining all of the above, a series of Fe–Zn catalysts promoted by K were prepared and combined with ZSM-5 zeolites for the direct conversion of CO2 to olefins and aromatics.744 Moreover, to improve aromatic selectivity, the morphology of H-ZSM-5 zeolites was modified by treatment with NaOH solution, which could form a hollow structure in the zeolite channel and thus reduce the residence time of aromatic intermediates in the channel, which not only improved the aromatic yield, but also prevented the over-hydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Thus, 45.2% aromatic selectivity was achieved at 42.6% CO2 conversion over K–3Fe/Zn–H-ZSM-5 (Table 9, entry 10). These results showed that an efficient bifunctional catalyst can be rationally designed and constructed by modifying the component composition and zeolite morphology to directly and selectively convert CO2 to aromatics.
Similarly, the catalytic performance of the tandem catalyst system comprising Na/Fe and HZSM-5 catalysts was explored for the direct and selective production of aromatics from CO2.745 An aromatic selectivity of 94% from hydrocarbon products was reached over under industrially relevant conditions, with para-xylene selectivity up to 70% for Na/Fe and SiO2-coated HZSM-5 zeolite bifunctional catalysts (Table 9, entries 11 and 12). The results of the experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the Na-promoted Fe catalyst and HZSM-5 with high Brønsted acidity are key factors for enhancing the CO2 conversion and aromatic synthesis, while the SiO2-coated HZSM-5 zeolite allowed suppressing the isomerization of the initially formed p-xylene and p-ethyltoluene in the zeolite channels when they diffuse out of the channels onto the external SiO2-coated surface (Fig. 69).

A prolonged 100 h test on the composite catalyst system showed that the Na/Fe catalyst exhibited good activity stability for both RWGS and FTS reactions, with CO2 conversion and CO to CO selectivity almost stable and around 30% and 27%, respectively. Unfortunately, the content of aromatics within the liquid hydrocarbons decreased from 91.6% to 70.3%, as well as the selectivity to p-xylene in xylenes, which decreased from 69% to 57%. The decrease in aromatics was attributed to the coke formation over coated-HZSM-5 zeolite with time on stream that implies lower activity for aromatization due to the lower amount of acid active sites, which led to the gradual increase of non-aromatic hydrocarbon products.
5.7.5 Conclusion. 
CO2 hydrogenation to gasoline, olefins and aromatics offers new opportunities to convert CO2 into value-added products and pave the path for CO2 circularity. In the last decade, significant advances in the development of tandem catalysts based on metal oxides and zeolites have been made for the selective hydrogenation of CO2 to lower olefins (C2–C4), gasoline (C5–C11) and aromatics (C6–C8) of wide interest for the chemical industry.
The high activity of heterogeneous catalysts is usually attributed to the synergy between the active sites and the support and/or the promoter. Nevertheless, the nature of the active sites responsible for the activation of CO2 and H2 and the intermediate species and reaction mechanisms are still elusive. Undoubtedly, the systematic study and understanding of the reaction mechanism, kinetics, thermodynamics, determination of reaction intermediates and active species due to the advantages of computational chemistry, and in situ and operando spectroscopy should allow a great understanding, to help to rationalize experimental results and thus the design of new efficient tandem metal oxide/zeolite catalysts and processes.
Besides the hydrogenation of CO and CO2 on metal oxide surfaces following the same mechanism involving formate and methoxide species, the cofeeding of CO2 and CO offers also an interesting strategy to lower CO formation by RWGS and maximize the yield and selectivity to hydrocarbon products.
Moreover, the hydrogenation of CO2 to hydrocarbons requires further development and improvement of catalyst activity, selectivity and stability for industrial application. A long-duration test should be performed to determine the catalyst stability as well as regeneration. Since CO2 conversion remains low, study of recycling is necessary. In the case of gasoline and aromatics, the separation should be easier, which for lower olefins would be a challenging issue.
In the same way, improvement of process selectivity is still required and challenging and expensive separation step should be avoided. Thus, new studies for the specific modifications of zeolite morphology, such as pore-size tuning and the poisoning of external acid sites, should allow controlling the hydrocarbon product selectivity.
As mentioned above, CO2 large-scale transformation will depend on CO2 availability and so on the capture technique, and H2 production that will be green to ensure a CO2-neutral process and a sustainable effective approach to the production of hydrocarbons. Undoubtedly, the future tandem catalyst for direct hydrogenation of CO2 to C2+ will be based on zeolite-type materials.

6 Syngas
On the path to greenhouse gas mitigation, the CO2 transformation into syngas constitutes a winning approach towards the sustainable production of chemicals and fuels. Further syngas conversion into MeOH or hydrocarbons allows reducing the CO2 emission and is a direct route for the production of fuels and chemicals through technologies already explored, developed and implemented (Fig. 70).

6.1 Catalytic reduction of CO2 with hydrogen (RWGS). 
6.1.1 Introduction. 
The conversion of CO2 to CO via a reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction has been widely explored due the availability of technologies such as the Fischer–Tropsch process and methanol synthesis to further convert CO into chemicals and fuels (Scheme 57 and Fig. 71).98,746,747 Indeed, a sustainable and renewable production of syngas will guarantee the sustainability of the Fischer–Tropsch process. On the other hand, the RWGS is an important reaction that can occur during several CO2 conversion processes such as methanation, as a possible first step for CO2 activation.748 Then, the main issues of the RWGS reaction are competitive CO2 methanation, and methanol formation limiting CO yield.749 The RWGS is an endothermic process and due to the stability and inertness of the CO2 molecule a high reaction temperature (500 °C) is required to produce CO and H2O.646 From a thermodynamics standpoint, low pressures allow limiting methanol synthesis358 and high temperatures favour the RWGS reaction and practically inhibit high exothermic methanation.573,750 Nevertheless, for economic and environmental considerations, lower temperatures are desired and avoiding CO2 methanation becomes a great challenge since methane is then a common side product.749 To date, the RWGS has not been industrialized due to high energy consumption and industrial costs.751 Precisely, the thermal design and optimization of the reactor is of paramount importance and heat energy will have to be produced from renewable or nuclear sources to minimize carbon footprint. Actually, only one industrial application in the tandem reaction of methanol synthesis, in the CAMERE process for the RWGS process, has been implemented.752–754

6.1.2 Mechanism. 

In situ characterization techniques are the key to determine the formation and nature of intermediates and adsorption strength on the catalyst surface. Then, techniques such as the transient quantitative temporal analysis of products (TAP), ATR-FT-IR or DRIFT spectroscopy and micro-calorimetry, as well as the use of isotopic kinetic studies to follow the evolution of intermediates have been used. The combination of in situ characterization techniques together with kinetic computational DFT calculations and modelling is essential for the elucidation of reaction mechanisms, the nature of the active sites involved and the rational design and development of efficient and selective catalysts.313 For CO2 adsorption and activation, the catalytic surface properties, and more specifically, the redox and acid/base properties of the support play a fundamental role in the formation of intermediates. Supports with oxygen vacancies such as TiO2 and CeO2 in contrast to Al2O3 or SiO2 allow the strong adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules and when an oxygen vacancy is in proximity to a metal site with adsorbed and dissociated H, it enhances the activity for the RWGS process.750,755,756
The RWGS mechanism has been studied on several metal supported catalysts, and different possible pathways for CO2 conversion, as presented below, have been proposed mainly based on the CO2 adsorption and reaction with dissociated H to form different intermediate species (formate, hydroxycarbonyl, and bicarbonates) or to be reduced directly into CO (Scheme 58 and Fig. 71):755
 Scheme 58  Possible proposed routes for the formation of CO over different types of supports and active sites.755,757 
– The carbonate route via CO2 adsorption over the surface to form carbonates that react with oxygen vacancies of reducible supports (TiO2 and CeO2756),
– The formate route via the adsorption on OH groups present on the surface (Al2O3) and
– The hydroxycarbonyl route757 after hydrogenation of CO2 at lower temperature.
Another mechanism was proposed for catalysts containing reducible oxides and originally for Cu that can be readily reduced and oxidized under reaction conditions. In this case, a metal (Cu) is oxidized by CO2 and reduced again by H2. This redox mechanism or direct CO2 dissociation over Cu-based catalysts involves the Cu0 oxidation into Cu+ with CO2 reduced into CO, while H2 reduces Cu+ to form H2O (Scheme 59).758,759
 Scheme 59  Redox mechanism or direct CO2 dissociation over Cu-based catalysts. 
However, the formate formation and decomposition to CO production is a widely accepted pathway mechanism in which first CO2 is hydrogenated into formate and afterwards the cleavage of the C–O bond takes place, while the carbonyl route by the dissociation of CO2 into CO over the metal was ruled out for metal based catalysts on reducible supports such as TiO2 and CeO2.
6.1.3 Catalysts for the RWGS process. 
The design and development of highly active and selective solid catalysts for the RWGS reaction should include the presence of well-defined multiple active sites combined with molecular selection through controlled adsorption, interactions and geometrical parameters that will lead to the formation of intermediates and transition-state stabilization. Accordingly, an efficient catalyst for the RWGS reaction requires
– Active sites for the adsorption of CO2 and the cleavage of the C–O bond but limited CO adsorption to avoid CO dissociation and subsequent hydrogenation into methane or CO hydrogenation into methanol. Therefore, to obtain an active and selective catalyst for CO2 reduction into CO, the optimal catalytic properties should be adjusted to adsorb and activate CO2, but not CO, by controlling the physicochemical properties of the support such as the presence of oxygen vacancies and/or of a promoter.
– Active sites (transition metal) for H2 dissociation and hydrogenation of released O (CO2) to produce H2O. The maximum metal activity should be achieved with suitable metal dispersion by selecting the optimal support and/or the addition of a promoter.
In the literature, the most frequently used metals for the development of catalysts for the RWGS process are Cu, Pt, and Rh supported on different types of supports (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, and CeO2) whose reducibility and acid–base properties play a key role over the activation of CO2 molecules and the reaction mechanism.760 Among them, the most commonly used catalyst for the RWGS process is Cu–ZnO/Al2O3 at low temperatures (170–250 °C) where high Cu dispersion was achieved.759,761,762 The advantage to prepare Cu-based catalysts is that Cu exhibits high catalytic activity at low temperatures for H2 dissociation with low methane production.758,763–766 Likewise, no CH4 production was observed over Au- and Cu-based catalysts.447,755 For CO2 adsorption and activation, the physicochemical properties of the support play a fundamental role and influence the formation of intermediates as mentioned above. Then, irreducible supports such as Al2O3 and SiO2 mainly enable high dispersion of the metal while a support with an oxygen vacancy such as TiO2 and CeO2 allows the strong adsorption and activation of CO2, while the presence of an oxygen vacancy closely to a metal site with adsorbed and dissociated H allows enhancing the activity for the RWGS process, as it was indicated by the differences in the activation energy for Au/TiO2 and Au/Al2O3 that imply different rate-determining steps (Fig. 72).755 Numerous catalytic systems have been reported in the literature for the RWGS reaction,755,760,767 and despite their huge potential to envelop or support metal nanoparticles, oxide mixtures, their high thermal stability, robustness and versatility in the chemical composition, metal-based zeolites and OMSs have been under-exploited to perform the RWGS reaction, and few references have been collected.

(a) OMS-based catalysts for the RWGS. 
(i) Monometallic OMS-based catalysts for the RWGS. Nickel has numerous applications for CO2 conversion due to its high activity, abundance and low price with respect to other metals. As demonstrated for the synthesis of DME, the use of ordered mesoporous materials has allowed achieving a high dispersion of active metal centers following the optimized synthesis pathway.768–770 Accordingly, a novel hydrophobic encapsulation strategy was described for the preparation of monodispersed NiO particles in SBA-15 by a direct hydrothermal synthesis method.770,771 The results showed that the NiO content affected CO selectivity at lower temperature though high NiO loading was required to achieve high CO2 conversion and 100% CO selectivity as it was previously reported (Table 10, entries 1–3).770 The high surface area and the mesoporous channels of MCM-41 were also advantageously used for the preparation of new RWGS catalysts. A direct hydrothermal synthesis route allowed preparing well-ordered mesoporous silica incorporating transition metals, such as Ni, Cu, Zn, and Co, with a high Si/metal ratio of 5. Ni–MCM-41, Cu-MCM-41 and Co-MCM-41 catalysts showed good catalytic activity for CO2 conversion into CO while Zn-MCM-41 exhibited very low catalytic performance. The activation energy values obtained for the different samples showed that the Ni–MCM-41 catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation was up to seven times higher than those of Co-MCM-41 and Cu-MCM-41 materials with high selectivity to CO2 methanation whereas no methanation was observed for Cu-MCM-41. The Cu-MCM-41 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic properties for the RWGS with maximum CO selectivity at 550 °C.772 The Co-MCM-41 and Ni–MCM-41 materials exhibited high catalytic activity although these exhibited lower CO selectivities, 95 and 70%, respectively (Table 10, entries 4–7). Fe-KIT-6 prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis with different Fe loadings showed well-ordered cubic structures and its structural integrity was preserved for Si/Fe ratios up to 10.773 The characterization of the Fe-KIT-6 sample (Si/Fe = 30) by EPR and XPS spectroscopies showed that Fe was present as a tetrahedrally coordinated iron atom in the KIT-6 framework, although the presence of extra-framework species/small iron oxide clusters could not be discarded. The Fe-KIT-6 sample with a higher Fe content exhibited the best catalytic performance for the RWGS reaction being the rate of hydrogenation a direct function of the amount of iron active sites and the reaction temperature, so a high iron content favoured methanation. Therefore, 97% CO selectivity at low 16% CO2 conversion was reached at 500 °C over Fe-KIT-6 (Si/Fe = 10) (Table 10, entry 8).

(ii) Bimetallic OMS-based catalysts for the RWGS. As aforementioned for methane, methanol or dimethylether synthesis, the addition of promoters allows modifying the CO2 adsorption capacity and activation, the reducibility, dispersion and stability of the metal, and the formation of new active species at the interface metal/support.519,774–776 The promoter can be a reducible transition metal oxide with oxygen vacancies such as TiO2 and CeO2 that play a key role for the CO2 activation, or second metals such Fe, Co, Ni Cu, and Zn.750,763
Accordingly, the catalytic performance of bimetallic CuO–NiO/SAB-15, NiO–CeO2/SBA-15 and CuO–CeO2/SAB-15 materials synthesized by the direct hydrothermal method in a strongly acidic medium was investigated. TEM–EDX analysis and characterization data revealed that, for bimetallic materials, in the case of NiO and CeO2, both oxides were simply mixed and well dispersed on SBA-15; in the case of CeO2 and CuO, CeO2 was covered by CuO while in the case of CuO and NiO, both oxides were separately well-dispersed in SBA-15. Compared with monometallic oxide/SBA-15, the obtained bimetallic oxides/SBA-15 catalysts exhibited excellent efficiency in terms of reducing CO2 to CO via the RWGS reaction and the CO2 conversion increased with temperature for all monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. Moreover, CO2 conversion over bimetallic samples was higher than that over monometallic ones. These results were attributed to the strong electronic interaction between metal active sites and the promoter, and/or the promoter and the reactant (CO2), which favour the RWGS reaction at lower temperatures. Thus, CeO2 doping allowed improving the catalytic properties of CuO and NiO owing to the presence of oxygen vacancies enhancing CO2 conversion. All the prepared monometallic and bimetallic catalysts exhibited 100% CO selectivity regardless of the temperature, except NiO–CeO2/SBA-15 which showed higher catalytic activity than all catalysts, at lower temperatures, but lower selectivity, in the temperature range of 400–700 °C due to methane production. However, at T °C > 700, the best catalytic performance was reached over NiO–CeO2/SBA-15, and 100% CO selectivity and maximum 55% CO2 conversion were achieved at 900 °C (Table 10, entries 9–14).777
Solid materials able to store and release oxygen reversibly at moderate temperatures are named oxygen storage materials (OSMs) or oxygen carriers. OSMs usually composed by transition metal oxides have received attention in the last few decades for the combustion of fuels with CO2 capture (as an oxidant)778 and for the RWGS779 through chemical looping, involving cyclic reduction and oxidation with oxygen storage materials (OSMs). Thus, numerous studies have investigated RWGS-chemical looping (REWGS-CL) involving cyclic reduction and oxidation of oxygen storage materials (OSMs) in order to maximize the efficiency of renewable H2, captured CO2 and the further CO conversion into fuels and methanol (Fig. 73).
 Fig. 73  Overall process of CO2 capture and conversion on H2-reduced oxides in the RWGS for the further CO conversion into fuels or methanol. Reprinted with permission from ref. 779. Copyright 2014, American Chemical Society. 
The RWGS-CL reaction is divided into two consecutive reduction and oxidation steps and the oxide material has the ability to form oxygen vacancies, adsorb and activate CO2 to exchange oxygen and produce CO and to be further reduced under H2 flow with water production (Scheme 60).779,780
 Scheme 60  Cyclic reduction and oxidation of oxygen storage materials (OSMs). 
The challenge is the design of an oxide material with high capacity to generate oxygen vacancies and stable over numerous cycles being the main drawback the metal oxide sintering at high temperatures. Perovskite-type oxides (ABO3) offer numerous synthesis and composition opportunities for matching and optimizing redox abilities.779,781–783 Due to their potential, perovskite oxides have been studied as potential catalysts for RWGS-chemical looping and specifically the La0.75Sr0.25FeO3 (LSF) perovskite.784–786 However, there is a limitation derived from the low surface area of the perovskites and different strategies have been followed to disperse perovskites on the support or to form composites. Accordingly, the perovskite oxide (LSF) was supported on SBA-15 by the addition of SBA-15 to the sol–gel perovskite synthesis media. The final material was tested for RWGS-chemical looping, and the CO yield was improved up to 10 times in the presence of the LSF/SBA-15 material in comparison to pure LSF. Nevertheless, the CO yield was low and between 2.5 and 3.6 mmol gLSF−1 at 700 °C (Table 10, entries 15–20). This attempt of supported perovskite oxides can be of interest for further studies.787
(b) Zeolite-based catalysts for the RWGS. 
(i) Monometallic zeolite-based catalysts for the RWGS. It has been demonstrated that the local environment of an active site influences strongly the activity and selectivity of a given reaction by adsorption and for the stabilization of a reaction transition state on solid catalysts.788 Moreover, Rh is well-known to exhibit high activity for CO2 hydrogenation. Therefore, a recent study explored the effect of the surroundings of Rh nanoparticles over the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity towards methane or CO production.789 In the case of zeolites, the neighbouring of the Rh metal nanoparticles could be varied by changing the framework composition and/or the zeolite structure. Then, a new and efficient strategy for the preparation of supported metal nanoparticles with high resistance to sintering by fixing the nanoparticles within zeolite crystals by the seed-directed growth technique was carried out.790 Therefore, the Rh nanoparticles were enveloped within the crystals with a defined and specific environment controlled by the zeolite composition (Si/Al ratio) that determines the hydrogenation pathway towards methanation or the RWGS. The catalytic data showed that in the presence of Rh@S-1 (pure silica, silicalite 1) a maximum CO selectivity of 79.8% with 51.6% CO2 conversion was reached, while in the presence of Rh@ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 30) 98.2% CH4 selectivity with 68.2% CO2 conversion was achieved, under the same reaction conditions (Table 10, entries 21 and 22; Fig. 74). In operando IR measurements allowed attributing these results to limited hydrogen spillover due to the absence of acid sites and fast CO desorption over the Rh@S-1 catalyst. These results offer new opportunities for the rational design of efficient and selective catalysts for a well-defined process.

(ii) Bimetallic zeolite-based catalysts for the RWGS. The combination of two metals in an oxide matrix provides a material with new physical–chemicals properties and specially affects the redox abilities due to electronic interactions. Cu-based catalysts exhibit high activity at low temperatures for CO2 hydrogenation and the WGS reaction, but are unstable at higher temperatures due to sintering, while Mo-based catalysts are selective catalysts for the conversion of CO2 into CO. Therefore, the activity of the bimetallic Mo–Cu-supported FAU zeolite catalyst was investigated for the RWGS and Mo/FAU catalysts doped with different amounts of Cu were prepared.791 The H2-TPR study revealed a shift in the reduction temperature for MoO3 indicating that the presence of Cu modifies the electronic properties of Mo, leading to an easier reduction for Mo oxide (Fig. 75). The catalytic study showed that the Mo-FAU catalyst reached 99% CO selectivity and 14.3% CO2 conversion at 500 °C while the doped-Cu catalyst, 7.6 wt% Mo–1.25 wt% Cu/FAU, exhibited the best catalytic performance, and reached 18.5 and 23.5% CO yields with 99% CO selectivity, at 500 and 600 °C, respectively (Table 10, entries 23–26). Then, the enhanced activity of the 7.6 wt% Mo–1.25 wt% Cu/FAU catalyst was attributed to the presence of Cu that improved the reducibility of MoO3 into MoO2.

(iii) Alkali effect over the catalytic activity of zeolite-based catalysts for the RWGS. The addition of alkali metals can greatly improve the activity or modify the selectivity of a catalyst for CO2 conversion due to the enhanced adsorption and activation of CO2 on basic sites.765,792 Following these leads, a recent study of the catalytic activity of Rh supported Y zeolite catalysts (RhY) and Li-doped RhY catalysts (Li/RhY) for CO2 hydrogenation revealed the great impact of the incorporation of alkali on the selectivity of the catalyst. CH4 was the main product over the RhY catalyst, while CO was the main product over the Li-doped RhY catalyst.793 The geometric and electronic structures of Rh species in Y zeolites were similar before the reaction but different after the reaction. Rh particle migration and aggregation out of the pores occurred in RhY, while Rh particles remained stable in Li/RhY owing to the presence of Li (Fig. 76). Different reaction mechanisms were proposed, and the difference in the selectivity process was attributed to the accumulation of CO on the particle surface on Li/RhY inhibiting H2 adsorption, while on RhY, CO adsorbed species react with OH groups and desorbed to enable H2 adsorption and CH4 formation. Thus, in the presence of the Li/RhY catalyst, at 450 °C, 87% CO selectivity at a ∼15% CO2 conversion level was reached whereas in the presence of RhY, 100% CH4 selectivity at a ∼25% CO2 conversion level was achieved (Table 10, entries 27 and 28).

6.1.4 Conclusion. 
The production of CO from the RWGS is a very attractive process due to its use as a building block for the synthesis of chemicals and hydrocarbons from Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, always considering the use of anthropogenic CO2 and green and renewable hydrogen. The main issue is the co-production of methane. It is crucial to make the RWGS catalysts 100% CO selective for commercialization, as an increase in hydrogen consumption will make the process more expensive, will require a subsequent separation process and will also affect the carbon footprint. In the few last decades, numerous studies on the RWGS using, specially, supported metals, have been carried out. The CO2 adsorption and CO desorption appear key factors for enhancing CO2 conversion and CO selectivity. Nevertheless, new efforts are still required to determine the reaction mechanism and find the working active sites to finally establish the structure–activity/selectivity relationship. Therefore, computational modeling and in situ spectroscopy studies will be fundamental tools for the rational design of efficient and highly selective catalysts for the RWGS. In the present review, a short compilation of works showed that the potential of ordered microporous and mesoporous materials has been scarcely considered and undervalued. The studies described present strategies to maximize CO selectivity and CO2 conversion, improving the metal–support interaction and stability, potentially through the incorporation of a promoter (alkali, second metal), increasing the oxygen mobility generating oxygen vacancies owing to the presence of reducible transition metal oxide or maximizing the dispersion and stability of metal nanoparticles by enveloping within the zeolite pore channel system. Enhancement of CO2 adsorption/activation and fast and easy CO desorption are key steps to consider for the design of new RWGS catalysts and catalyst issues. In addition, future studies will focus on the catalyst deactivation mechanism in order to improve the stability of catalysts for the RWGS. Undoubtedly, the unique properties of zeolites and OMSs as supports to confine, disperse and stabilize metal species due to their pore structure and high surface area make them attractive supports for the development of RWGS catalysts. The benefits of the support morphology and pore topology to enhance the dispersion and attachment of metal species should be fundamental. Therefore, future studies should focus on hierarchical zeolites, two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets and core–shell materials to promote the physical isolation and protection of particles as well as mass transfer.


6.2 Dry reforming of methane (DRM). 
6.2.1 Introduction. 
The catalytic dry reforming of methane into synthesis gas (H2 + CO) is a very attractive CO2 conversion since it makes possible the simultaneous mitigation of two important greenhouse gases, CH4 and CO2 (Fig. 77). DRM is a 100% atom efficiency process and provides a highly regarded H2/CO ratio of 1 for further industrial conversion such as Fischer–Tropsch and other valuable chemicals (methanol). However, in practice, DRM requires high energy consumption due to the very endothermic character of the reaction. Moreover, the high temperatures required by the process induce a rapid deactivation of the catalyst due to sintering of the metal and severe coke deposition. So far, the rapid deactivation of the catalyst together with the high energy use constitutes the biggest obstacle to the development of an environmentally friendly industrial application to date. Therefore, the design of a robust and efficient catalyst at “low temperatures” is topical and very challenging.

6.2.2 Thermodynamics. 
DRM is highly endothermic and a high temperature is required to reach high thermodynamic conversions. Hence, for an industrial implementation, renewable energy sources must be considered in order to achieve an economically and environmentally sustainable process. Simultaneously, the RWGS can take place and decrease the H2/CO ratio to a lower value than an ideal ratio of 1. However, the main drawback remains the strong deactivation of the catalyst because of coke deposition originated mainly from methane decomposition (cracking) and CO disproportionation (Fig. 78). A study based on the standard free energy change determines that DRM occurs above 640 °C and the RWGS above 840 °C, while coke formation by methane cracking takes place from 557 °C and coke formation by CO disproportionation (the Boudouard reaction) is inhibited above 710 °C due to high exothermicity.794–796 Therefore, at a temperature of >800 °C, superficial carbon species are issued from CH4 cracking, and can be easily oxidized by CO2, limiting the formation of coke (route 2, Fig. 79). At lower temperature, low reactive carbon species obtained from the Boudouard reaction are formed and coke deposition is more critical.797 Coke formation not only induces severe catalyst deactivation because of the encapsulation of the active sites or carbon fiber formation on the catalyst surface but also causes reactor plugging. Different studies have determined the limit temperature for carbon deposition for different CO2/CH4 ratios in the feed, and showed for the same feed ratio that the temperature limit for carbon deposition increased as the pressure increased and, that, at a given pressure, the temperature limit for carbon deposition increased as the CO2/CH4 feed ratio decreased, indicating that CO2 excess in the feed has to be used to avoid coke.794–796 However, it was shown that higher CO2/CH4 favours the RWSG and produces the lower H2/CO ratio,796,798 while the incorporation of steam into the system can help preventing the coke formation but decreases CO2 conversion.799,800 Moreover, the use of high pressures even if is of interest from industrial standpoints promotes carbon deposition.801,802 The equilibrium constant for the endothermic DRM reaction increases significantly when increasing the temperature, maximizing CO2 and CH4 conversion, while the Boudouard reaction and CH4 cracking are also favoured. Therefore, the design of active, efficient and highly stable catalyst is decisive for a kinetic control of the DRM process and to avoid coke formation.

6.2.3 Mechanism of dry reforming of methane. 
The main accepted mechanism for DRM involves the reversible adsorption and dissociation of CH4 on the catalyst active sites to produce four adsorbed hydrogen active species (that are further converted into H2), and adsorbed carbon species oxidized into CO (reduction of the catalyst/lattice oxygen) and on adsorption and dissociation of CO2 on the support to yield CO and lattice oxygen (oxidation of the catalyst/oxygen vacancy) (Scheme 61 and Fig. 79).803,804 A suitable catalyst has to present high reducibility and oxygen storage capacity enabling high oxygen mobility to successfully support the redox cycle: CO2 being reduced into CO.

6.2.4 Catalysts for DRM. 
In spite of the great challenges from environmental and industrial standpoints, DRM is not currently perceived as an industrially viable process, because of carbon formation, quick sintering/deactivation of conventional reforming catalysts and high energy consumption. Over the last 30 years, DRM studies have shown that Ni catalysts are the most suitable candidates for industrial implementation owing to their low cost and availability in comparison to noble metal (Pt, Ru, and Rh) based catalysts. Noble metals exhibit higher activity because of their ability to dissociate CO2 into CO and O species that favour the CH4 dissociation into CHn and H species. However, unlike noble metal catalysts,806 Ni suffers from strong coke formation and deactivation.807,808 To prevent carbon and nickel carbide formation, an optimum range of operation temperature, between 870 and 1040 °C, was determined.794 Hence, numerous strategies were developed to minimize coke deposition on Ni catalysts, consisting mainly in minimizing and stabilizing the Ni particle size since carbon deposition on the Ni surface requires Ni ensembles, and thus large Ni particles enable severe coke deposition.809,810 Several studies defined the optimum Ni nanoparticle size of few nanometres (<10), for which the carbon deposition is significantly minimized.811,812 Nevertheless, small Ni nanoparticles present low thermal stability under DRM reaction conditions.813,814 Hence, different approaches have been followed to minimize the Ni particle size and maximize the Ni sintering resistance. The choice of a suitable support not only allows a high dispersion of the metal nanoparticles, but can also provide specific physicochemical properties such as basicity (CaO, La2O3, and MgO), high oxygen mobility (oxygen vacancies/storage capacity) (CeO2, ZrO2, and TiO2), and modifying reducibility, and enhances the catalytic activity or improve the catalyst stability, avoiding carbon formation. Additionally, the incorporation of one or more metals as promoters can play different roles such as improving the dispersion and stabilization of the active phase, usually by forming homogeneous solution of oxides and strong metal support interactions, and/or enhancing the catalytic activity owing to the introduction of new physicochemical properties (redox and acid/base).815 Likewise, the incorporation of basic metals such as lanthanides, alkali and rare earth metals showed to enhance the stability of Ni nanoparticles in addition to promote the chemisorption and activation of CO2, and accelerate the reaction of CO2 with carbon species to form CO.816,817 Accordingly, several studies showed that carbon deposition could be limited or suppressed due to the presence of strong Lewis basic sites.818–821
(a) DRM zeolite-based catalysts. 
Among suitable supports, zeolites are of potential interest due to their physicochemical properties to deliver high metal dispersions and stable catalysts under hard reaction conditions. More specifically, MFI and USY zeolites exhibit suitable properties such as microporous structures, high surface areas, and high capacity for CO2 adsorption, and consequently, zeolite based catalysts have been extensively studied for the DRM process.
Different comparative studies showed the impacts of the acidity, reducibility and the structure of a zeolite on the catalytic properties for DRM. The catalytic performance of Ni based-zeolites (A, X, Y and ZSM-5) prepared by impregnation investigated the effects of Ni loading and the zeolite structure.822 The maximum catalytic activity was achieved with the 7 wt% Ni content while coke deposition was observed with the following order of deactivation: Ni/Y < Ni/X < Ni/ZSM-5 < Ni/A. The maximum 91% CH4 and 93% CO2 conversions with H2/CO around 1.8 were maintained at 700 °C for 5 h TOS over 7% Ni/Y that exhibited the highest performance and good potential for DRM (Table 11, entries 1–4). Previously, a comparison of the catalytic performance of Ni/Al2O3, Ni/ZSM-5 and Ni/USY showed the impacts of the acidity and zeolite structure over the catalytic properties of the catalyst and the metal reducibility due to the strong metal–support interaction, which determine the following order of reducibility: Ni/ZSM-5 > Ni/USY > Ni/γ-Al2O3.823 Ni/USY and Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts exhibited superior catalytic performance than Ni/ZSM-5 but also had superior Ni contents, 8.7 and 8.1 versus 3.5%, respectively. After 6 h TOS, at 650 °C, 71% and 54% of CH4 conversions and 71.2% and 56.3% CO2 conversions were obtained over Ni/USY and Ni/ZSM-5, respectively (Table 11, entries 5–7). Later on, another study of the catalytic activities of the Ni/γ-Al2O3, Ni/Y, and Ni/H-ZSM-5 samples prepared by impregnation, with the 5 wt% Ni content, confirmed the dependence of the CH4 conversion on the support.824 However, a different stability order of the Ni-based catalysts was established: Ni/H-ZSM-5 > Ni/γ-Al2O3 > Ni/Y. The best catalytic data were obtained over Ni/H-ZSM-5 with a H2/CO ratio close to 1 owing to the lower carbon deposition registered and the higher stability of the textural properties of the catalyst (BET area). High CH4 and CO2 conversions were achieved over all the Ni catalysts, close to 80% with a H2/CO ratio close to 1 along 9 h TOS (Table 11, entries 8–10). The very stable MOR was compared with FAU, both with a 2.5–3 wt% Ni content.825 The MOR based catalysts exhibited the better catalytic performance in terms of conversion and stability (Ni/HMOR > Ni/NaMOR > Ni/HY). At 750 °C, for 24 h TOS, 92% and 87% CO2 conversions and 86% and 75% CH4 conversions were achieved over Ni/H-MOR and Ni/NaMOR, respectively (Table 11, entries 11–14). The data of CO, H2 and H2/CO were not provided. The mixing Ni/H-MOR and Ni/NaMOR and Ni/HY with Al2O3 allowed improving the stability of the catalyst by reducing coke deposition.

These comparative studies evidenced the potential of zeolites as the support for the design of DRM catalysts. Nevertheless, short-term experiments were performed indicating low catalytic stability. Different strategies were reported to improve the robustness of the zeolite based catalysts and the preparation method, metal doping, and modification of the basicity or morphology have been studied. MFI zeolites were the most support used for the design and development of DRM catalysts while other zeolite structures have been investigated more occasionally being the use of FAU more common.
(i) MFI as the support for the preparation of DRM catalysts.
* ZSM-5 as the support for the preparation of DRM catalysts. ZSM-5 has been widely used as the support for DRM catalysts due to its easy synthesis within a wide range of compositions. Recently, the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite with micropores and mesopores was impregnated with Ni and used for DRM. The data of CO2 and CH4 conversions and the H2/CO ratio revealed that a sample with Si/Al = 30 exhibited the highest catalytic performance, at 800 °C. The maximum 98% CO2 and 95% CH4 conversions with a H2/CO ratio close to 0.9 were maintained for 30 h (Table 11, entry 15).826 These results were attributed to the acid strength and crystallinity of the ZSM-5 structure. Samples with lower acidity exhibited lower catalytic activity and showed lower crystallinity and BET area. In addition to high catalytic performance, the Ni/ZSM-5(30) micro-mesoporous sample exhibited high stability and resistance to coke deposition, with no-deactivation registered after 30 h TOS. For all samples, the same tendency was observed, and due to the endothermicity of DRM, CH4 and CO2 conversions and H2/CO ratio increased when the temperature increased.
– Effect of the preparation method of Ni/ZSM-5-based catalysts for DRM. The activity and stability of DRM catalysts strongly depend on Ni nanoparticle dispersion and metal–support interactions, which in turn influence metal sintering and coke resistance. Therefore, the preparation method constitutes an important strategy to control the metal location, deposition and dispersion. The benefits of the chemical and physical effects of high intensity ultrasound for the synthesis of metal supported nanoparticle catalysts and nanomaterials have shown to minimize the metal particle size, improve the distribution and dispersion of the particles, and enhance the catalytic features.827–829 Following this strategy, the sonochemical method was applied to the preparation of Ni/ZSM-5 with different Ni contents (3–20 wt%).830 The characterization data showed that the ZSM-5 crystallinity decreased slightly upon Ni incorporation. A positive effect of the use of ultrasound was observed for lower 3–8 wt% Ni contents with a better dispersion and a decrease in the Ni particle size (lower than 100 nm). Nevertheless, an average large Ni particle size of about 43 nm was determined that can be considered still too large. Indeed, the Ni particle size and stability are critical parameters to control and minimize coke deposition which is formed on the Ni-ensemble and consequently low Ni particles with a size <10 nm are desirable.809,810 The 8 wt% Ni/ZSM-5 sample exhibited the better catalytic performance with a 70% CH4 conversion and a H2/CO ratio of around 0.8–0.9 for 24 h TOS, at 850 °C (Table 11, entry 16), while no data on coke analysis were provided.
– Bimetallic ZSM-5-based catalysts for DRM. The addition of a second metal or a promoter, especially noble metal and rare earth metals, is well known to enhance the activity, selectivity, dispersion and stabilization of metal nanoparticles and coke resistance. The presence of a second suitable metal allows for strong metal/metal and metal/support interactions due to electronic interactions leading to the increase of the metal surface area, modifications of the surface structure and improved lattice oxygen mobility compared to monometallic catalysts.831–836 Some studies reported that, in the case of lanthanide doped catalysts, coke deposition was filamentous and did not affect the catalytic activity but may cause reactor plugging.837–840

Effect of transition metal doping of Ni/ZSM-5-based catalysts for DRM. Recently, the catalytic performance of Ni–Co/ZSM5 monometallic and bimetallic catalysts was studied.841 Cobalt was shown to reduce carbon deposition due to its ability to oxidize adsorbed carbon into CO and CO2.842 Therefore, the preparation of bimetallic catalysts allowed enhancing the catalytic activity and minimizing coke deposition due to the synergetic effect between Ni and Co.842–846 Then, the bimetallic 2.3 wt% Ni–4.6 wt% Co/ZSM5 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic activity and stability with 5 wt% coke formation in comparison with 46 wt% coke formatted on monometallic samples.841 At 800 °C, 80% CH4 conversion and 85% CO2 conversion with 65 and 61% H2 and CO selectivities, respectively, were achieved (Table 11, entries 17–20). The results showed that coke deposition was dependent on the temperature and catalyst composition. Over 2.3 wt% Ni–4.6 wt% Co/ZSM5 at 700 °C and after short 12 h TOS, CH4 and CO2 conversions decreased from 66 to 50% and 71% to 61%, respectively, while the C balance increased from 73 to 80%. Mn has also been studied as the promoter for DRM Ni-based catalysts and enabled suppressing carbon deposition and improving catalyst life. Following these leads, the effect of the incorporation of different Mn loadings on Ni(10 wt%)-zeolites (NH4-ZSM5, NH4-Y, and Na-Y) over their catalytic performance was explored.847 The catalytic results showed that the initial best catalytic activity was achieved in the presence of the 10 wt% Ni-ZSM-5 catalyst, but the CH4 conversion and H2 production decreased within the first 5 h TOS. After the first 5 hours, similar activity was reported for all the 10 wt% Ni-zeolite catalysts. CH4 and CO2 conversions ranged between 22–25% and 34–36%, respectively. The addition of Mn affected the catalytic activity of three types of zeolite supports differently, but their catalytic performance was not improved (Table 11, entries 21–24). The positive effects of low Mn loading were the reduction of carbon deposition and the decrease in the Ni nanoparticle size and dispersion on the zeolite. However, as Mn loading increased, the crystallinity of the zeolite structure and its micropore surface area generally decreased. The incorporation of different ZrO2 loadings to the Ni-ZSM-5 catalyst showed that the presence of ZrO2 enhanced the Ni nanoparticle dispersion and minimized the Ni particle size due to the strong metal–support interaction, and 8 wt% Ni and 5 wt% ZrO2 contents were optimum.848 In the presence of Ni(8%)/ZrO2(5%)-ZSM-5, at 850 °C, 95% CO and 90% H2 yields were reached and remained constant for 10 h TOS (Table 11, entry 25). Very high CO and H2 yields were achieved but the catalytic stability was demonstrated over too short TOS to evaluate its potential as the industrial catalyst.

Effect of rare earth metal doping of Ni/ZSM-5-based catalysts for DRM. Numerous studies of DRM using Ni-based catalysts showed that the incorporation of a second metal or metal oxide such as La, Y, and Ce improved considerably the catalytic activity and limited coke deposition due to the strong electronic interaction between Ni species and the second metal and/or the support favouring high dispersion of Ni nanoparticles and the formation of new active species.849–851 Accordingly, the benefits of La doping on the Ni/ZSM-5 catalytic activity for DRM was explored.852 La2NiO4/ZSM-5 was prepared by the sol–gel technique and the RXD pattern confirmed the formation of La2NiO4 species with a spinel structure in the fresh sample, uniformly and highly dispersed on ZSM-5. The catalytic study showed that 69% CO2 and 67% CH4 conversions and a H2/CO ratio close to 0.9 were higher over the La2NiO4/ZSM-5 catalyst than those over Ni/ZSM-5 or La2NiO4/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Moreover, La2NiO4/ZSM-5 presented higher stability over 35 h TOS. The improved stability of the La2NiO4/ZSM-5 catalyst was attributed to the formation and decomposition of the La2O2CO3 species that enable the oxidation of dehydrogenated carbon species accumulated on Ni particles. The XRD patterns revealed the disappearance of La2O3 species and the formation of the La2O2CO3 species by CO2 adsorption on La2O3 during the DRM process. Afterwards, the La2O2CO3 species decompose into CO and oxygen species that enable the oxidation of carbon species accumulated on Ni particles into CO (Fig. 80), as it was previously described.851,853 The same group studied the catalytic performance of LaNiOx/ZSM-5 in a pilot plant, which was shaped as the cylinder of LaNiOx/ZSM-5 (∅ = 3 mm × 10–15 mm), and prepared by a sol–gel method.854 97% CH4 and 94% CO2 conversions were achieved and remained constant for 100 h, at 850 °C but with a low GHSV of 1.3 L h−1 gcat−1 (Table 11, entries 26 and 27).

The benefits of the CeO2 addition to Ni based-catalysts have been widely reported such as the improvement of Ni nanoparticle dispersion, enhancement of redox properties, high oxygen storage capacity enabling the splitting of the C–O bond and formation of Lewis basic sites promoting the adsorption and activation of CO2.832 Moreover, the enhanced oxygen mobility allowed oxidizing adsorbed carbon species on metallic particles into CO and preventing coke deposition.855,856 Following these leads, the effects of Ce, Ni loading and temperature calcination over the catalytic performance of Ni–Ce/ZSM-5 catalysts were studied under optimized DRM conditions (temperature, CH4/CO2 ratio and space velocity).857 The catalytic data revealed that CH4 and CO2 conversions increased with Ni loading until stabilization (10 wt%) while an optimum in Ce was determined. Previously, it was reported that the Ce content enabled improving oxygen mobility and Ni dispersion and enhancing the DRM rate.627,858,859 The highest activity was achieved for 2 wt% Ce loading with 90% CH4 and 78% CO2 conversions, and under optimized parameters of reaction, up to 99% CH4 and 94% CO2 conversions were achieved. The stability test evidenced good catalytic performance and stability, maintaining 95% CH4 and 85% CO2 conversions with a syngas ratio close to 1, for 40 h TOS without notable deactivation (Table 11, entry 28). Later on, the effect of the addition of the controlled amount of Ce to Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts, the role of Ce in the improvement of the catalytic performance, and the limitations of coke deposition were studied.860 The optimum catalytic results were achieved over 5 wt% Ni–5 wt% Ce/ZSM-5, at 800 °C, excellent 97% CH4 and 91% CO2 conversions with 98% H2 selectivity and H2/CO ∼ 1 for short 24 h TOS while neither the longer stability test nor the regeneration study were performed (Table 11, entry 29). Similar conclusions were drawn. The addition of Ce enhanced Ni particle dispersion, favoured CH4 dissociation and H2 production, and strengthened the gasification of coke owing to enhanced CO2 adsorption and oxidation of adsorbed carbon. A XPS study allowed determining the presence of CeO2 and CeAlO3 in the reduced and used catalysts leading to a proposed redox cycle in which CO2 enabled the oxidation of CeAlO3 and regeneration of CeO2 + Al2O3 (Scheme 62). Moreover, the calculated apparent activation energies of CH4 and CO2 could be reduced by 30% and 40%, respectively.

The effect of different additives (Cu, Nd, and Mo) over acidity, Ni dispersion and turn over during catalytic performance in the DRM process was studied using the Al2O3-HZSM-5 zeolite as the support.861 The study of the addition of metal oxide revealed that the presence of Cu maximized the H2 yield. Meanwhile, the addition of rare-earth elements influenced the catalytic activity and the Nd incorporation maximized the H2 yield. Finally, the Mo addition maximized the H2 yield up to 70%. The authors concluded that the incorporation of different metal oxides increased the complexity of the catalyst and the acidity, responsible for the improved catalytic activity. Under optimized reaction conditions, at 850 °C, 98% CH4 and 97% CO2 conversions with a H2/CO ratio close to 1 were achieved over NiCuNdMo/Al2O3HZSM-5 (Table 11, entry 30). Unfortunately, no stability test was performed.

Effect of noble metal doping of Ni/ZSM-5-based catalysts for DRM. The benefits of the addition of noble metals to Ni zeolite-based catalysts due to their resistance to coke deposition have also been explored. Then, the preparation of Ni/ZSM-5 catalysts incorporating a small amount of noble metal (Pt) for the DRM process was described.839,862 The catalytic study revealed that the maximum catalytic results corresponded to optimum Ni and Pt metal loadings of 6% and 0.5%, respectively.862 The characterization data allowed attributing the enhancement of catalytic activity and coke resistance to the higher Ni dispersion and decrease of Ni nanoparticle size and improved NiO reducibility owing to the presence of Pt. The TPR study indicated a shift to a lower temperature of NiO reduction for higher Ni contents for monometallic samples. This result was attributed to the formation of nickel species with a larger particle size, with a small interface with the support, and a weak NiO/support interaction that make nickel oxide easy to be reduced. Therefore, the larger the particle size, the lower the reduction temperature. On the other hand, the presence of a small amount of Pt in Ni catalysts evidenced the easier reduction of NiO, probably because Pt is reduced first and activates hydrogen which favours the reduction of NiO by spill over. Moreover, the improved coke resistance of Pt promoted Ni catalysts was attributed to the formation of Pt–Ni particles covered mainly by Ni, leading to high Ni particle dispersion and the formation of a higher amount of active carbon species further oxidized into CO. Thus, at a low reaction temperature (600 °C), modest 28% CH4 and 69% CO2 conversions were achieved (Table 11, entries 31 and 32). Previously, the preparation of Ni–Ru bimetallic catalysts already showed the effect of the Ru incorporation over the catalytic activity and stability (Table 11, entries 33 and 34).839 The Ru addition effect was more important for silica than that for H-ZSM5 supported catalysts. The improvement in catalytic activity and stability was observed for bimetallic samples, which was related to higher dispersion of Ni nanoparticles due to the Ni–Ru cluster formation. Nevertheless, neither any data of conversion nor yield were provided.
– Effect of the basic properties of the Ni/ZSM-5-based catalysts for DRM. The presence of alkali metals may influence the physicochemical properties of Ni catalysts due to electronic interactions of alkali metal/Ni modifying the reducibility of Ni and dispersion, surface acidity and surface CO2 adsoprtion by forming carbonate species. Indeed, the surface basicity influences strongly the CO2 adsorption and activation and plays a key role in C–O bond splitting. Moreover, the CO2 coverage of the catalytic surface allows minimizing CH4 adsorption/dissociation and coke formation. Therefore, to take advantage of basicity, a study of the presence of alkaline promoters such as Ca and K over the catalytic activity of Ni-ZSM-5 catalysts for DRM was carried out. The resistance to coke deposition of KNiCa/ZSM-5 was attributed to the CO2 coverage on the catalytic surface limiting CH4 decomposition. At 800 °C, high 94% CH4 and 95% CO2 conversions and 94% H2 and 95% CO selectivities were recorded (Table 11, entry 35).863 A previous study showed that the high 95% CO2 conversion over KNiCa/ZSM-5 with a high resistance to coke formation along 140 h TOS, at 800 °C, was due to the formation of carbonate species on alkaline metals (Ca) located adjacent to Ni sites, as well as to CO2 dissociation.863–865 Not long ago, the preparation of doped Ni/Fibrous-ZSM-5 catalysts with Ta, Mg, and Ca illustrated the new catalytic properties of fibrous catalysts for the DRM reaction.866 The addition of promoters modified the surface acidity with the following trend Ni–Ga/FZSM-5 > Ni/FZSM-5 > Ni–Mg/FZSM-5 > Ni–Ta/FZSM-5 > Ni–Ca/FZSM-5. The Ta incorporation implies the disappearance of strong acid sites and the formation of medium acid sites enabling the stabilization and redispersion of Ni particles. The incorporation of Mg and Ca involved an increase in the concentration of weak acid sites, while the addition of Ga species increases the concentration of strong acid sites promoting side reactions and coke formation. A H2-TPR study revealed the synergism between Ta and Ni, promoting the reducibility of NiO as it was observed with the addition of Ca and in contrast to the incorporation of Mg where a shift to a higher reduction temperature was formed (Fig. 81). The surface basicity order was Ni–Ca/ZSM-5 > Ni–Mg/FZSM-5 > Ni–Ta/FZSM-5 > Ni–Ga/FZSM-5 > Ni/FZSM-5. The catalytic data showed that samples with higher acidity suffered rapid deactivation, while excessive basicity (Ca) promoted the RWGS reaction. The catalytic results showed that there is a balance between reducibility and acid–base properties to manage optimum adsorption and activation of CO2, preventing CH4 decomposition and enhancing metal activity through strong metal–support interactions, while preventing coke deposition. High catalytic performance was achieved over Ni–Ta/FZSM-5 with 93% CH4 and 98% CO2 conversions and 0.97 H2/CO ratio, with high stability over 80 h TOS, at 800 °C (Table 11, entries 36–41). Very good performance was reported but the reaction temperature was too high. However, since H2 and CO yields were not given, neither information on catalyst regeneration was supplied, it is difficult to ascertain the potential of this catalyst.

– Effect of the morphology of the ZSM-5-based catalysts for DRM. In the last few years, the preparation of microcapsule catalysts with a core/shell structure has been widely explored to improve the stability of metal nanoparticles due to the confinement effect preventing sintering, and the resultant catalysts have been applied in different processes.644,867–871 Following these leads, a microcapsule catalyst, Ni/ZSM-5@SiO2, was prepared by the sol–gel method with Ni/ZSM-5 as the core and amorphous SiO2 as the shell.872 The characterization data showed high Ni nanoparticle dispersion and stability due to strengthened interactions between Ni particles and the ZSM-5 core, and the spatial confinement provided by the core–shell structure (Fig. 82).

Therefore, CH4 and CO2 conversions were higher over coated catalysts than uncoated ones. The superior catalytic performance of the 10 wt% Ni/ZSM-5@SiO2 catalyst in comparison to that of the 10 wt% Ni/ZSM-5 catalyst was ascribed to coke deposition resistance induced by the SiO2 shell owing to the large surface area and the pore volume of the 10 wt% Ni/ZSM-5@SiO2 composite, ensuring higher dispersion and immobilization of Ni particles. A test of catalyst activity and stability over 50 h for 10 wt% Ni/ZSM-5 and 10 wt% Ni/ZSM-5@SiO2 catalysts showed high catalytic performance with activity decay attributed to coke deposition and Ni-sintering. At 800 °C, CH4 and CO2 conversions between 90 and 83% over 50 h of TOS were achieved (Table 11, entries 42 and 43). Recently, the preparation of fibrous materials and particularly of fibrous zeolites offers new opportunities for synthesizing catalysts with a large pore constituted by porous and dendrimeric silica fibres with great accessibility to active sites. Fibrous materials not only provide materials with a large pore system allowing the diffusion of bulky reactants and high surface area, but also the spatial confinement effect of Ni particles. Likewise, Ni/Fibrous-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibited superior catalytic properties for the DRM reaction than microporous Ni/ZSM-5.866 At 750 °C, 55 and 78% CH4 conversions and 61 and 79% CO2 conversions were achieved over Ni/ZSM-5 and Ni/FZSM-5, respectively (Table 11, entries 36 and 37).
* Silicalite-1-based catalysts for DRM. The peculiarity of the silicalite-1 zeolite is the large number of structural defects (silanol groups), up to 32 per unit cell, whose weak acidity affects both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst for different processes.873,874 Therefore, the effect of post-synthesis modifications by thermal treatment after ionic exchange and silylation procedure over Ni-silicalite-1 catalytic performance (CH4 and CO2 conversions, H2/CO and coke deposition) for the DRM process was studied.875,876 Silylation enabled the formation of smaller and more reducible Ni-oxide species, avoiding the formation of nickel silicates (Fig. 83). Therefore, silylated samples reached better CH4 conversion with low coke formation of whisker-type that is favoured over the Ni ensemble of a minimum seven Ni atoms, with a particle size larger than 5 nm, being Ni very small particle size, <2 nm,811 a key factor to inhibit tubular whisker carbon formation.812 At 700 °C, 78–72% CH4 and 88–80% CO2 conversions with H2/CO around 1.05 were maintained over 26 h TOS (Table 11, entries 44 and 45).

Recently, encapsulated Ni clusters into microporous silicalite-1 catalysts were prepared and used for DRM. The Ni/silicalite catalyst exhibited high stability and no coke deposition under a wide range of conditions.877 The authors claimed the presence of Ni–O–Si species intercalated into the silicalite-1 framework that enables the stabilization of small metallic Ni-clusters preventing sintering and coke formation (Table 11, entry 46).
– Effect of the morphology of the silicalite-1-based catalysts for DRM. The benefits of fibrous mesostructures, with micropore and mesopore systems, such as their high surface area, enhanced diffusion for bulky molecules and accessibility to active sites are of great interest for the synthesis and development of efficient catalysts and their use as the support, to achieve high dispersion of metallic particles and stabilization by the spatial confinement effect.878 In line, mesostructured fibrous MFI was synthesized by the microemulsion zeolite seed crystallization method, and Ni was supported by incorporation via different routes. Ni-mesostructured fibrous MFI catalysts owing to the fibrous morphology, high Ni dispersion, strong metal–support interactions and moderate acidity exhibited the improved stabilization of Ni particles and catalytic activity over time on stream.879 Thus, excellent catalytic performance and high stability of 5 wt% Ni/MFI prepared by wet-impregnation was recorded, with 70% CH4 and 73% CO2 conversions (Table 11, entry 47). Kinetic studies revealed that the activation energy of CH4 and CO2 was dependent on the surface acidity that boosted CH4 cracking and other side reactions. The encapsulation of metal particles into zeolite micropores or cavities allows increasing the activity, selectivity and stability of the catalyst reducing metal sintering (Fig. 84).48,51,707,870,880,881

Since encapsulation can present limitations of diffusion and accessibility to nanoparticles of reactants in sub-nanometric micropores, new developments in zeolite synthesis allowed the preparation of new materials with hierarchical structures containing micropore and mesopore systems or more advanced architectures such the core–shell or hollow structures.882 Hollow zeolites are very attractive due to their crystalline structure, hydrothermal and chemical stabilities and shape-selectivity due to their pore systems and versatility in their properties and compositions.883 Accordingly, the catalytic performance of encapsulated Ni–Pt bimetals in hollow silicalite-1 was reported for the first time in 2015.884 The preparation of hollow 1.5 wt% Ni–0.5 wt% Pt@HolS-1 enabled high dispersion of Ni–Pt bimetallic nanoparticles encapsulated in hollow silicalite-1. The 1.5 wt% Ni–0.5 wt% Pt@Hol S-1 catalyst exhibited higher catalytic performance for DRM over brief 6 h TOS than 1.5 wt% Ni–0.5 wt% Pt/S-1 that suffered rapid deactivation after 1 h, and then 1.5 wt% Ni@Hol S-1 due to the Pt doping effect and improved stability against sintering and coke deposition, only 1.0% carbon deposition was observed. Although the 1.5 wt% Ni–0.5 wt% Pt/S-1 and 1.5 wt% Ni@Hol S-1 catalysts had similar coke deposition, they exhibited different catalytic stabilities (Fig. 85).

The ensemble of Ni atoms with a minimum metal particle diameter was required to form filamentous carbon. In the case of 1.5 wt% Ni/S-1, because of large Ni particles, filamentous carbon deposition occurred inducing rapid deactivation. Since 1.5 wt% Ni@HolS-1 supported well dispersed and encapsulated Ni nanoparticles in the hollow zeolite with a small particle size (∼3.44 nm) and Ni larger particles on the outer surface (∼14.6 nm), filamentous carbon was also formed but the catalytic activity was maintained. Although the Ni–Pt particles exhibit a sintering resistance, 1.5Ni–0.5Pt/S-1 deactivated quickly due to coke deposition without the protective shell, while 1.5Ni–0.5Pt@Hol S-1 exhibited the best catalytic performance and stability owing to the high bimetallic nanoparticle dispersion and the spatial confinement effect of the shell, lowering coke formation. At 800 °C, 0.1 MPa, 72% CH4 and 80% CO2 conversions were maintained for 6 h TOS over 1.5Ni–0.5Pt@Hol S-1 (Table 11, entries 48–51). Good catalytic results were reported over short TOS, and neither any data of H2 and CO yields nor selectivity were reported, which together with low metal contents augured low yields and a short operating life.
– Pt/silicalite-1-based catalysts for DRM. As mentioned above, among the strategies to improve metal supported catalysts and minimize sintering, the encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within the zeolite, hollow or core–shell material constitutes an emerging approach. Accordingly, amorphous-silica-coated metal nanoparticles (<2 nm) were successfully prepared and used in the presence of the organic structure-directing agent, under hydrothermal conditions to convert amorphous-silica-coated Pt nanoparticles into the zeolite and provide a Birdcage-type zeolite catalyst encapsulating small metal nanoparticles (Pt@silicalite-1).885 Pt@silicalite-1 with a low Pt content, 0.1 wt%, exhibited higher and more stable activity than Pt/silicalite-1 for DRM, at 670 °C, over 12 h, moderate 66–56% CO2 and 54–38% CH4 conversions with 0.8–0.6 H2/CO ratio (Table 11, entry 52). The superior catalytic performance of Pt@silicalite-1 was attributed to higher metal dispersion and good sintering resistance. Nevertheless, at 670 °C, rapid deactivation was recorded due to zeolite structure collapse, implying that the thermal stability of the zeolite could play an important role in the catalytic stability of Birdcage-type catalysts for the DRM process.
* CeO2–Ni/MCM-22 catalysts for DRM. The effect of ceria incorporation to metal nanoparticle supported catalysts has been largely reported due to the improvement of metal dispersion and stability, and NiO reducibility due to the presence of the high amount of oxygen vacancies and high oxygen mobilities. Accordingly, the catalytic performance for DRM of a series of Ni–MCM-22-based catalysts with different CeO2 contents, prepared by a sol–gel method, was recently reported.886 The catalytic data showed an optimum cerium content (8 wt%), and the best catalytic performance was obtained over the 8 wt% CeO2–9 wt% Ni/MCM-22 catalyst owing to the high oxygen storage capacity together with improved NiO reducibility (O2 and H2-TPR, Fig. 86). Higher CeO2 loading is unfavourable because Ni particles are partially covered. The characterization data revealed the stability of the spent catalyst structure at 750 °C, and that the addition of CeO2 enabled higher Ni nanoparticle dispersion and improved reducibility. Moreover, the presence of CeO2 in Ni/MCM-22 minimized coke deposition (3–4 wt%) on Ni due to the high oxygen storage capacity at the interface Ni/CeO–Si groups leading to easy oxidation of adsorbed carbon species into CO. Thus, at 750 °C, very good 83–75% CH4 and 99–92% CO2 conversions with H2 and CO selectivities over the 8 wt% CeO2–9 wt% Ni/MCM-22 catalyst with a H2/CO ratio around 0.84 were maintained for 60 h TOS (Table 11, entries 53 and 54). These results illustrated the great potential of MCM-22 to the development of the industrial catalyst although no patent was published.

* FAU-based catalysts for DRM. – Co/Y-based catalysts for DRM. The use of sonochemical, plasma and microwave for materials synthesis has much interest due to the impacts of these catalyst preparation methods on physicochemical properties such as the dispersion and stability of metal nanoparticles, surface areas, reduced particle sizes, higher homogeneity, softened synthesis conditions (time and temperature) and reduced cost.887–891 Then, the effect of ultrasounds and Co-loading over the Y zeolite catalytic performance for DRM was shown to enhance the dispersion of Co nanoparticles and surface areas in comparison to impregnation methods,892 and nanoparticles with an average crystallite size of around 30–40 nm were formed. The best catalytic results were obtained for the 10 wt% Co content at a reaction temperature of 850 °C. The maximum 81% CH4 and 90% CO2 conversions with a H2/CO ratio close to 0.76 were achieved, with good selectivity towards H2 and CO production, being those 75 and 88%, respectively, with catalyst moderate stability over 10 h TOS with a continuous decrease in CH4 and CO2 conversions (Table 11, entries 55–57).
– Catalytic performance of bimetallic Faujasite-based catalysts for DRM. The addition of a second metal, especially a noble metal and a rare earth metal, is well known to enhance activity, selectivity and the catalyst coke resistance in comparison to monometallic catalysts. The influence of different preparation methods, wetness impregnation and two solvent routes was compared for the preparation of bimetallic Ni–Rh/Y catalysts for DRM. The catalytic results showed an enhancement of the 7.5 wt% Ni/NaY catalytic properties prepared following two solvents routes.893 Moreover, the incorporation of Rh allowed improving the reducibility of NiO particles due to higher Ni dispersion and enhanced stability. With the 0.1 wt% Rh content, excellent 100% CH4 and CO2 conversions were achieved at 584 °C, respectively, while only 60% CH4 and CO2 conversions were reached at 559 °C, over 0.1 wt% Rh–7.5 wt% Ni/NaY (Table 11, entries 58 and 59). The interesting results were achieved at low temperatures along short 12 h TOS. A study of the Mn incorporation effect over the catalytic activity and stability of three Ni-based zeolite catalysts showed different impacts depending on the support, but the catalytic results were not improved (Table 11, entries 64–67).847 The positive effects of low Mn loading were the reduction of carbon deposition and the decrease of the Ni nanoparticle size and dispersion on the zeolite support. However, as the Mn loading increased, the crystallinity of the zeolite structure and its micropore surface area generally decreased.
– Effect of the basic properties of Ni/Y-based catalysts for DRM. As mentioned above, the presence of basic sites enables minimizing carbon deposition owing to the higher CO2 coverage of the catalytic surface and lower methane decomposition. Accordingly, MgO has been considered a suitable additive to DRM catalysts improving activity and stability.894,895 A study of Mg, Mn, K, and Ca additions onto Ni/HY catalysts revealed the improved resistance of the catalyst to coke deposition.894 Mg, Mn and Ca doping induces an increase in the activity and stability of the Ni/HY catalyst while K doping worsens them with high coke formation and reactor plugging. The BET and XRD characterization data indicated that the presence of Mg allowed reducing the Ni nanoparticle size and enhancing Ni dispersion owing to the partial coverage of NiO particles by MgOx. Moreover, the presence of basic sites favoured the CO2 coverage of the Ni–Mg/HY catalyst surface minimizing the CH4 decomposition and coke deposition. The other characterization data were not provided. At 700 °C, 93% CH4 and 89% CO2 conversions with a H2/CO ratio close to 0.94 were maintained over 720 h (Table 11, entry 68). High catalytic performance was disclosed but no data of H2 and CO selectivities were provided and a high CH4/CO2 ratio of 3 was used.
* BEA zeolite-based catalysts for DRM. The beta zeolite was scarcely used as the support for the development of DRM catalysts. The catalytic activity of bimetallic based zeolite catalysts has been reported, specially incorporating Ni–Rh over MFI or FAU type zeolites due to the great influence of the support.896 Accordingly, the benefit of Rh incorporation into Ni/Beta zeolites was recently described.896 The Rh-beta sample exhibited the higher catalytic results and stability while the addition of Rh to the Ni catalyst allowed enhancing the activity and stability in comparison to the monometallic Ni sample. At 700 °C, 74% CH4 and 78% CO2 conversions and moderate selectivity to CO and H2 with a H2/CO of ∼1.17 were achieved over Rh–Ni/beta catalysts with good resistance to coke formation (2.85 wt%) (Table 11, entries 69–71). Because the presence of basic sites plays an important role over carbon deposition and CH4 decomposition, MgO has been considered a suitable additive to DRM catalysts improving activity and stability.894,895 Accordingly, the addition of MgO to Ni/beta catalysts was shown to enhance the catalytic performance and stability of the DRM catalyst.897 The Ni/10 wt% MgO-beta catalysts exhibited better activity with low carbon deposition (2.0 wt%) after 7.5 h TOS. At 800 °C, 95% CH4 conversion and 97% CO2 conversion with a H2/CO ratio close to 1.05 were achieved (Table 11, entry 72). Earlier, a comparison study of beta and Y zeolites as the support for Ni–Pt based catalysts was reported.898,899 Dealuminated Y and beta zeolites were used as supports for the preparation of bimetallic Ni and Pt catalysts. The dealumination process created mesopores enabling the higher dispersion of the metal nanoparticles and improving catalytic activity. The Y zeolite exhibited a higher total acidity in comparison to the beta zeolite. The catalytic performance of bimetallic Ni–Pt/zeolite catalysts revealed lower activity than that of monometallic Pt samples, 1.70 and 1.90 mol gmetal−1 h−1 for Ni–Pt/Y and Ni–Pt/β, respectively, and 2.0 and 3.20 mol gmetal−1 h−1 for Pt/Y and Pt/β, respectively, while Ni/Y and Ni/β were practically inactive due to severe carbon deposition (∼60 wt%) (Table 11, entries 60–63). The higher activity of bimetallic in comparison to Ni samples was attributed to the adsorption of CO2 on the adjacent Ni site together with Pt. However, the best catalytic data were achieved in the presence of the Pt-beta catalyst, due to the higher accessibility and stability of the beta and lower acidity in comparison to the Y zeolite that suffered strong carbon deposition. On the other hand, the Pt-beta catalyst exhibited higher activity and stability than Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/C due to superior resistance to coke deposition (16 wt%) attributed to improved Pt nanoparticle dispersion. Nevertheless, low catalytic results were reported, and in particular, the CH4 conversion decreased gradually on 24 h from 30 to 20%.
* DRM-combined technology.
– DRM-combined plasma technology. As described above, the non-equilibrium character of the plasma system enables overcoming the barrier energy and thermodynamic limitations at low temperatures in chemical processes such as CO2 conversions.668–670 Various types of non-thermal plasma exist and among them, DBD constitutes a versatile technique with some advantages such as the uniform distribution of micro-discharges, high-energy electrons and operability under ambient conditions.900 Accordingly, DRM was studied under thermal, plasma and plasma-assisted thermal conditions in the presence of Ni (15%) on Al2O3, TiO2 and ZSM-5.901 The best catalytic performance was achieved over Ni/Al2O3 under plasma conditions due to the Ni lower particle size and higher surface area. The best reaction conditions were reached under plasma (DBD) thermal conditions since the reactants can be previously activated in the DBD zone and react in the thermocatalytic reactor (Scheme 63). Moreover, the recombination of different carbon species can lead to the formation of hydrocarbons and alcohols. Good 76% CH4 and 71% CO2 conversions were obtained over 15Ni/ZSM-5, at 500 °C, under plasma-assisted thermal conditions, while 73% CH4 and 68% CO2 conversions were achieved under thermal conditions (Table 11, entries 73 and 74). No data of stability were provided.
 Scheme 63  Equations of the formation of different reactant species and reactions under plasma activation conditions. 
Few years earlier, a study of the DRM process under DBD plasma conditions in the presence of the 4A zeolite was reported.902,903 The effects of the peak voltage, total gas flow rate and CO2/CH4 ratio over CO2 and CH4 conversions and H2/CO were studied. At a high-applied voltage level (from 6 kV to 12 kV), the high energy electrons generated in the plasma discharge zone may dissociate CO2 and CH4 molecules in the gas phase and on the catalyst surface. The results of the DBD process showed that CO2 and CH4 conversions increased by the increase of the peak voltage that greatly affected the H2/CO ratio that varied from 1.8 to 1.3. For the DBD process with the catalyst, the H2/CO ratio was close to 1 for all applied voltages, indicating a simultaneous production of H2 and CO due to catalytic reactions. Therefore, the best catalytic results were reached with 12 kV, 900 Hz and CO2/CH4 with 50% CO2 conversion, 46% CH4 conversion and H2/CO ∼ 1 in the presence of the zeolite (Table 11, entries 75 and 76).
– DRM + POM (partial oxidation of methane) combined processes. To date, the DRM commercialization is not envisioned due to strong limitations such as high energy consumption due to the endothermic process, rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke deposition and water formation that reduce the syngas selectivity and the H2/CO ratio. The possible combination of DRM and POM (partial oxidation of methane) processes constitutes a promising alternative to DRM commercialization since it presents several advantages and allows counteracting the deficiencies of the stand-alone DRM (Scheme 64). The combination of DRM/POM is supposed to improve heat transfer due to the coupling of both exothermic and endothermic reactions leading to a more efficient energy process, while the variation in the feed composition allows tailoring the H2/CO ratio, and the O2 addition limits the coke formation and improves the CH4 conversion and catalyst stability.904–906 Ni-based catalysts are suitable for the development of combined POM + DRM owing to the high nickel activity, availability and price. Moreover, in the two last decades, great efforts have been made to improve the activity, robustness and stability of Ni-based catalysts through the addition of different types and nature of promoters, control of Ni nanoparticle size and dispersion, Ni nanoparticle confinement and Ni improved reducibility, being Ni-based catalysts good candidates for industrial implementation.
 Scheme 64  Equation of POM + DRM reactions. 
Efforts in developing a new class of supported catalysts based on silicon carbide (SiC) showed the SiC great mechanical and thermal properties and inertness. SiC can be prepared in commercially viable shapes into monolith or honeycomb. These desirable properties make SiC a valuable support in comparisons to conventional ones (SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2).907 The honeycomb-shaped SiC as the catalyst support can strengthen the heat transfer and mass transfer and due to its hardness and light weight it is an attractive catalyst support for the fluidized bed reactor. Then, the silicalite-1 zeolite was deposited on the honeycomb-like monolithic SiC foam by hydrothermal synthesis. The Ni-silicalite-1-coated SiC (Ni/S-1/SiC) catalyst was so prepared by impregnation and used for combined DRM and POM (Fig. 87).908 POM is a mildly exothermic reaction and enables the production of syngas. Nevertheless, due to the presence of a hot spot and explosion danger, this reaction can be applied only in combination with the endothermic reaction such as DRM. The Ni/S-1/SiC monolith catalyst exhibited high catalytic performance and stability for DRM/POM processes over 30 h TOS, and higher than Ni/S-1 and Ni/SiC catalysts. At 750 °C, 0.1 MPa, 56.1% CH4 and 52.1% CO2 conversions with a H2/CO ratio close to 1.07 were maintained for 30 h TOS with a CH4:CO2:O2 = 8:4:2 ratio (Table 11, entry 77). On the other hand, the H2/CO molar ratio obtained over the Ni/S-1/SiC catalyst could be optimised by varying the CH4:CO2:O2 ratio. The better catalytic results of the Ni/S-1/SiC monolith catalyst were attributed to the strong interactions between the SiC support and metal Ni particles improved by silicalite-1 coated SiC, inhibiting the aggregation and sintering of Ni particles. The TG analysis of the used catalyst revealed that the Ni/S-1/SiC monolith catalyst showed good resistance to coke deposition being 4 wt%.

Another strategy to enhance the catalyst stability is the addition of a second metal improving the distribution of Ni over the support due to the formation of strong metal–support interactions and smaller metallic particle sizes.909 Accordingly, the mixing of Co and Ni resulted to enhance the catalyst activity and stability for the DRM process.836,910,911 Following these approaches, Ni, Co, and Ni–Co supported on ZSM-5 synthesized by the microwave assisted hydrothermal method (ZSM-5mw) and on the commercial sample (ZSM-5HT) were prepared and used as catalysts for POM and DRM processes to syngas production.912 The Ni and Ni–Co based ZSM-5mw and based ZSM-5HT catalysts exhibited high catalytic activity for POM and DRM processes with a low 2 wt% of the metal content with a syngas yield up to 97% in the temperature range of 850–950 °C (Table 11, entries 78–80). The simultaneous presence of Ni and Co increased the resistance to coke deposition for the DRM reaction and prevented the formation of carbon fibres usually observed on Ni catalysts. The authors did not explain the higher resistance of the bimetallic catalyst to coke deposition and only described the formation of Co3O4 for the Ni–Co based ZSM-5 samples.
(ii) Conclusion. Catalytic dry reforming of methane is an important strategy to mitigate the emissions of CH4 and CO2 greenhouse gases. Ni based-zeolite catalysts owing to the huge properties of zeolites such as the high surface area and thermal stability offer opportunities for the preparation of DRM catalysts. Moreover, different strategies have been reported to improve the dispersion and stabilization of nickel particles by the addition of a suitable second metal (promoter), enabling the establishment of new electronic metal/metal and metal/support interactions that enhance the NiO reducibility and coke resistance owing to the oxidation of carbon species deposited on the Ni particle surface, or by the control of acidity/basicity through the incorporation of alkali metal promoting CO2 adsorption and activation (C–O cleavage). Thus, great opportunities for the development of robust catalysts based on zeolites have been reported and the results summarised in the Table 11 illustrate the high activity of zeolite-based catalysts for the DRM reaction at high temperatures. The high energy consumption remains the main drawback of the technology that will be produced from renewable (wind, water, and sun) or nuclear sources. Considering CO2 conversion and ratio H2/CO as functions of GHSV and TOS some results can be highlighted as shown in Fig. 88 and 89 where Ni/ZSM-5(30), 5 wt% Ni–5 wt% Ce/ZSM-5, La–Ni/ZSM-5 cylinder, Ta–Ni/FZSM-5, 5 wt% Mg–Ni13 wt%/HY and 10 wt% Ni–10 wt% MgO/BEA (Table 11, entries 15, 29, 27, 41, 68 and 72) exhibited the interesting catalytic performance. Nevertheless, only for 5 wt% Ni–5 wt% Ce/ZSM-5, the data of H2 and/or CO2 yield and/or selectivity are given and so the productivity can only be evaluated in this case.

(b) OMS-based catalysts for DRM. 
Different strategies have been followed to improve the catalytic properties, robustness and stability of Ni based catalysts towards Ni sintering and coke deposition, such as the incorporation of noble metals and transition metals to enhance the reducibility and dispersion of Ni, or of alkali and alkaline earth metals to create basic sites enhancing the adsorption and activation of CO2 (C–O cleavage), or the confinement of nanoparticles inside hollow, core–shell or mesoporous structures. Accordingly, OMSs have been explored as supports, especially to control the nanoparticle size, dispersion and stability owing to the high surface area and controllable pore size providing the beneficial spatial confinement effect to prevent Ni particle sintering. Recently, a study of the role of the pore size and the wall thickness of a series of mesoporous structures including MCM-41, KIT-6 and SBA-15 over the activity of Ni-catalysts prepared by the impregnation method for DRM was reported.913 The results indicated that small pore diameters and thin silica walls of MCM-41 were responsible for lower catalytic performance due to low ability to prevent Ni sintering. Thus, Ni–MCM-41 exhibited the lower activity in comparison to Ni-SBA-15 and Ni-KIT-6 (Table 12, entries 1–3). Previously, a comparative study of Ni supports over OMS and zeolites showed that CH4 and CO2 conversions were dependent on Ni particle average size that was controlled by the high specific area of the support, strong metal–support interaction and metal reducibility.914 Thus, larger Ni particles (23–29 nm) were preferentially obtained from more readily reduced Ni owing to the weaker interaction with the zeolite support. In contrast, smaller Ni particles (9–11 nm) were formed from slowly reduced Ni due to the strong interaction with the SBA-15 and Al-MCM-41 supports through Ni–O–Si or Ni–Al bonds. Moreover, smaller particles exhibited a higher sintering resistance and the formation of filamentous coke did not induce catalytic deactivation. Filamentous carbon deposition was observed by SEM and from DTG profiles, with amount increasing in the following order Ni/Al-MCM-41 > Ni/SBA-15 > Ni/MFI and negligible for Ni/FAU. At 750 °C, over Ni/Al-MCM-41 and Ni/MFI, 94 and 70–60% CH4 conversions and 93 and 65–55% CO2 conversions were achieved, respectively, along 12 h TOS (Table 12, entries 4–7). These results showed the higher physicochemical properties exhibited by OMSs than those by zeolites to the support and disperse metallic active sites, and design and develop robust and efficient DRM catalysts.

(i) Ni/SBA-15-based catalysts for DRM. In 2006, the confinement effect of Ni nanoparticles into the stable mesoporous structure of SBA-15 was reported.915 The catalytic performance of Ni/SBA-15 with different Ni contents prepared by impregnation exhibited excellent and stable 90% CO2 and CH4 conversions at 800 °C, over 600 h of TOS, with 92 and 94% H2 and CO selectivities, respectively, over 12.5% Ni/SBA-15 (Table 12, entry 8). After 600 h of TOS, CO2 and CH4 conversions, the catalysts suffer severe deactivation due to coke deposition (14.8 wt%). An additional study of catalyst regeneration would have been the key. The reported catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance over the long-term test and its potential to the development of the industrial catalyst should be considered.
* Effect of the preparation method of Ni/SBA-15-based catalysts for DRM. The preparation method of Ni supported catalysts can strongly affect the metal dispersion, particle size and interaction with the support. Therefore, different methods have been reported with the aim to improve the dispersion and stability of metal nanoparticles and favour the strong metal–support interaction. Recently, the catalytic behavior of previously prepared Ni nanoparticles with a homogeneous size of ∼5 nm and further supported on ordered mesoporous silica (SBA-15), alumina and commercial silica was described.916 The characterization and catalytic data revealed that the ordered mesoporous structures were more suitable to stabilize Ni nanoparticles due to the beneficial confinement effects preventing nanoparticle aggregation. The presence of Lewis acid sites in the case of the alumina support was responsible for higher coke formation at a lower temperature. Ni/SBA-15 with 1 wt% Ni exhibited the best catalytic properties. A study of the reaction temperature revealed that 800 °C was the optimum temperature to perform DRM avoiding the strong aggregation phenomenon of Ni nanoparticles that took place at 850 °C. Indeed, at 800 and 850 °C, 91.4 and 45.9% CH4 conversions, 91 and 70% CO2 conversions were reached with 0.79 and 0.97 H2/CO ratios, respectively, over Ni/SBA-15 (Table 12, entries 9–12). The use of organic solvents as dispersants and stabilizing agents for the preparation of supported metallic nanoparticles has been recently developed. The use of ethylene glycol (EG) to support Ni (11 wt%) on SBA-15 as the solvent and the delivery conveyor of the Ni precursor inside the SBA-15 pore systems was first described in 2014.917 The resulting catalyst exhibited improved coke and sintering resistances owing to the confinement effect of SBA-15 and smaller Ni nanoparticles. At 750 °C, 96% CH4 and 87% CO2 conversions with a H2/CO ratio of ∼1 were maintained over Ni/SBA-15-EG along 20 h TOS (Table 12, entries 13 and 14). Later, EG was newly used as the solvent and the delivery conveyor to study the spatial confinement effect of SBA-15 walls over Ni/SBA-15 physicochemical and catalytic features.918 High dispersion of Ni nanoparticles (7 wt%) with a small particle size (∼3.1 nm) embedded into the Al-SBA-15 mesostructure was successfully achieved. The comparison of the catalytic behavior of Ni/SBA-15 catalysts revealed that the sample prepared with EG exhibited better catalytic activity. Moreover, a study of catalytic stability showed that Al conferred higher hydrothermal stability to the Ni/Al-SBA-15-EG catalyst and potential for the prolonged use under harsh conditions. The benefit of the confinement effect to prevent sintering was demonstrated with average Ni particle sizes of 3.2 and 3.6 nm for fresh and spent catalysts, respectively. At 700 °C, 70 and 72% CH4 conversions and 79% CO2 conversion were achieved over Ni/SBA-15-EG and Ni/Al-SBA-15-EG, with 0.91 and 0.95 H2/CO ratios, respectively, along 15 h TOS (Table 12, entries 15–17). The effect of different impregnation techniques (impregnation (IM), rotary evaporator- (RE), shaker (SH) and ultrasounds (US)) for the preparation of 3 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalysts from waste POFA (palm oil fuel ash) over their catalytic and physicochemical properties was recently investigated.919 The characterization and catalytic data revealed that the impregnation method influenced the Ni particle size and dispersion, and interaction with the support through the formation of Si–O–Ni bonds (FTIR spectra) with the following order of the Ni-support interaction for Ni/SBA-15 samples: RE < SH < IM < US. The basicity distribution of the Ni-containing mesoporous catalysts determined by CO2-TPD evidenced three peaks with different temperature regions, indicating three types of basic active sites for CO2 adsorption on the catalyst surface with different strengths (Fig. 90). The Ni/SBA-15 sample prepared by impregnation under ultrasound exhibited the higher amount of strong basic sites. Finally, the catalytic study showed that the activity and stability varied with the preparation method in the following order: US > IM > SH > RE. Ultrasounds showed to provide the catalysts with a smaller Ni particle size with good dispersion and stronger interactions with the support responsible for the higher catalytic activity and resistance to Ni sintering and coke deposition of the 3 wt% Ni/SBA-15(US) sample. Thus, 80% CO2 conversion and 95–90% CH4 conversions with a H2/CO ratio of 0.89 were maintained over 24 h TOS at 800 °C in the presence of the 3 wt% Ni/SBA-15(US) catalyst (Table 12, entries 18–21).

On the other hand, the impact of homogeneous precipitation (HP) and impregnation (imp) preparation methods over the catalytic performance of Ni/SBA-15 samples was also compared.920 The characterization results revealed high dispersion and a small size (2–5 nm) of Ni nanoparticles and improved NiO reducibility owing to the strong metal–support interaction with improved sintering resistance. Consequently, the catalytic results showed the better catalytic performance of Ni/SBA-15(HP) than that of Ni/SBA-15(imp). At 800 °C and 100 h TOS, good and stable 74% and 80% CH4 and CO2 conversions with H2/CO up to 0.9 were achieved over Ni/SBA-15(HP) and with certain amount of filamentous coke deposition (Table 12, entries 22 and 23). Previously, the influence of the three Ni/SBA-15 preparation methods, impregnation (IM), precipitation (PM) and precipitation-reduction with ascorbic acid (RM), over their physicochemical and catalytic properties was investigated.921 The characterization data revealed that confined and small Ni particle sizes (∼5 nm) were obtained through PM and RM methods, while through the IM route, Ni was mainly present on the outer support surface with worst dispersion and a higher particle size (∼12 nm). Moreover, different Ni-active phases were dispersed and Ni-species met in the IM sample are NiO species, and those met in the PM sample are only phyllosilicate species, while in the RM sample both phyllosilicate species and NiO-species are met. During the DRM process, the IM catalyst suffered rapid deactivation, while PM and RM catalysts exhibited improved stability, and the PM catalyst showed slightly higher activity and selectivity than the RM sample, resulting in a higher H2/CO ratio (0.87). Thus, 8 wt% Ni/SBA-15(RM) exhibited higher catalytic performance with stable 65% CH4 and 90% CO2 conversions, at 600 °C, over 24 h TOS (Table 12, entries 24–26). Moreover, lower coke deposition in the form of filamentous carbon was formed, closed to 11 wt% for the RM catalyst while 46 wt% was formed over the IM catalyst inducing severe deactivation. The effect of the use of different chelating agents such as ethylene diamine (en), acetic (ace) and citric (cit) acids and without (conventional (cm)) to prepare Ni/SBA-15 by impregnation over Ni dispersion and nanoparticle size was recently examined.922 The benefits of electron-pair donor atoms (O, N) of ligands such as ethylenediamine and citric acid, which possess two and three electron-pair donor atoms respectively, able to form a chelate ring with a single metal with strong steric hindrance, in contrast to citric acid that will always give rise to a multimetal ring structure favourable to metal agglomeration, were shown. Moreover, the viscosity of the chelated metal solution is higher than the solution of inorganic salts, reducing the evaporation of the solvent that prevents the agglomeration of metal particles. Therefore, the assisted chelating agent impregnation method allowed preparing catalysts with highly dispersed and ultrafine Ni nanoparticles (4–6 nm) and with the improved coke deposition resistance. At 800 °C, all the samples initially exhibited high activity while the stability test, over 50 h TOS, showed that samples issued from the modified impregnation method exhibited higher and stable activity with good CO2 and CH4 conversions up to 85% and 80%, respectively (Table 12, entries 27–31). The characterisation data determined a coke formation of less than 10–20 wt% for the catalysts prepared in the presence of the chelating agent, while 40 wt% coke was analysed for the sample prepared by the conventional method.
Ni nanoparticle deposition through the conventional impregnation method is usually controlled by diffusion and by bulk oxide type formation with the weak metal–support interaction. Consequently, the resistance to sintering of Ni nanoparticles is low. As an alternative, a new ammonia evaporation (AE) method was developed where the solvated metal precursor by ammonia is dispersed over the surface of the support which is in suspension in aqueous solution and a subsequent heating evaporates ammonia leading to the hydrolysis of the metal–ammonia complex. Following this synthetic route, the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst was prepared and the catalytic performance checked and compared to the results obtained in the presence of a sample prepared by the conventional impregnation method.923 Therefore, a smaller Ni particle size from 3.05 to 5.17 nm, higher dispersion and homogeneously distribution with an average diameter of 4.09 nm inside the mesopores were obtained following the described AE method, leading to the strong metal–support interaction. Then, a higher metal/support interaction allows achieving the metal with a smaller particle size. In contrast, the broad range of a particle size from 2.47 to 17.1 nm were obtained for the Ni/SBA-15(IM) sample prepared by impregnation. Therefore, even if both catalysts exhibited high initial activity, they showed different stabilities along 100 h TOS. The Ni/SBA-15(AE) catalyst displayed high coke deposition and sintering resistance owing to strong metal–support interactions. Thus, at 750 °C, 75% CH4 and 80% CO2 conversions were maintained over Ni/SBA-15(AE) over 100 h TOS with H2/CO close to 0.85 (Table 12, entries 32–35). All these results showed the impacts of the preparation method on metal dispersion and the particle size controlled by the metal–support interaction, and its impact on the catalytic activity, stability and the resistance of Ni-particles to sintering and coke deposition.
* Preparation of bimetallic Ni/SBA-15-based catalysts for DRM. The impacts of the addition of a suitable second metal or a promoter are well known to modify the electronic properties of Ni and contribute to enhance the dispersion and stabilization of metal nanoparticles by establishing the strong metal–support interaction and thus promoting the catalytic activity, stability and coke resistance.
– Effect of the addition of rare earth metals to Ni/SBA-15-based catalysts for DRM. The benefits of the incorporation of CeO2 have been well described to enhance the catalytic properties and stability of metal-based catalysts by establishing the strong metal–support interaction, providing high oxygen mobility and the formation of active sites at the interface metal/support. Accordingly, the effect of the Ce loading over the catalytic properties of the prepared Ni/SBA-15 by the sol–gel method was explored for DRM.924 The results showed that the optimum 7 wt% Ce content existed corresponding to high catalytic activity and good catalytic stability with 95% CH4 and CO2 conversions, and ∼1 H2/CO ratio, at 700 °C for short 6 h TOS (Table 12, entries 40 and 41). The incorporation of Ce improved Ni dispersion and the interaction of metal–support and minimized coke deposition due to its ability to oxidize carbon species formed on Ni particles. Previously, a study of Ce incorporation into the physicochemical and catalytic features of Ni–Ce/SBA-15 revealed the promoting effect over Ni nanoparticle dispersion and the increase of oxygen mobility and activity owing to Ce incorporation.925 Ce was incorporated by the direct hydrothermal method, favouring high Ce dispersion onto the SBA-15 surface that in turn promoted the formation of small and highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles deposited by the impregnation method. A H2-TPR study showed shifts of the high temperature reduction peak to a lower temperature indicating a change in NiO reducibility attributed to the surface oxygen species on Ni/Ce-SBA-15 samples with higher mobility and activity when increasing the Ce content due to the Ce redox properties and the formation of oxygen vacancies (Fig. 91).926,927 Moreover, the presence of oxygen species on the catalytic surface helps preventing the carbon formation. The best catalytic performance was achieved over 12 wt% Ni/Ce-SBA-15 (Si/Ce = 0.04) with good ∼78% CO2 and 76% CH4 conversions over 40 h TOS at 700 °C (Table 12, entries 42–44).

Recently, a study of the addition of La and Ce to 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalysts by the co-impregnation method over the physical and chemical properties of the catalysts showed that the incorporation of the promoters enabled reducing the Ni nanoparticle size and improve the dispersion of metallic particles.928 The TPO analysis enabled evaluating the coke deposition amount with the following decreasing order 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 > 3 wt% Ce–10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 > 3 wt% La–10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 revealing that the promoter addition improved the coke deposition resistance because of their basic properties, favouring CO2 adsorption and dissociation, and carbon oxidation and posterior elimination. Thus, the best catalytic activity and stability were achieved over the 3 wt% La–10%Ni/SBA-15 sample with 93% CH4 and 95% CO2 conversions at 750 °C for 24 h TOS (Table 12, entries 45–47). The La addition to the highly dispersed Ni/SBA-15 catalyst following a new synthetic route using oleic acid as the precursor was previously investigated.929 The benefits of the La incorporation in promoting the strong metal–support interaction was shown by a H2-TPR study. An increase in the La amount from 1 to 2 wt% resulted in an increase in the amount of strongly bound NiO species and a simultaneous decrease in the amount of weakly bound NiO species on the support, while a further increase produced the opposite effect. The deconvoluted TPR at T > 600 °C allowed quantifying the strong NiO/support interaction and evaluated the strong metal–support interaction degree after the normalization of metal–support interactions. Therefore, a correlation between the strong metal–support interactions and CH4 conversion was established (Fig. 92). Moreover, 1% La–Ni/SBA-15 and 2% La–Ni/SBA-15 catalysts had the smallest metal particle sizes, 2.8 and 3.2 nm, respectively, due to the stronger metal–support interaction. Thus, an optimum in La loading of 1 wt% was determined based on the analysis of catalytic performance and characterization data (Ni nanoparticle size, dispersion and stability). At 700 °C, over 1 wt% La–5 wt% Ni/SBA-15, ∼84% CH4 and ∼86% CO2 conversions along brief 12 h TOS were achieved (Table 12, entries 48 and 49). Additionally, CO2 isotopic studies evidenced that CH4 dissociation took place over highly dispersed Ni active centres while CO2 was adsorbed and decomposed on La active centres and enabled the oxidation of deposited carbon on the surface, improving the catalytic stability and minimizing carbon deposition.

The benefits of Sm doping over the catalytic and physicochemical properties of Ni and Co/SBA-15 prepared in two steps by the two-solvent impregnation method was also examined for DRM.930 Different tendencies for Sm addition to 10 wt% Co and 10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 were observed. The incorporation of 1 wt% Sm enabled improving the dispersion and reduce the particle size of NiO mainly located inside the mesopores while in the case of Co3O4, higher agglomeration and lower dispersion were observed with particles located mainly on the external surface. A H2-TPR study confirmed that stronger metal/support interactions are established after Sm doping in the case of NiO promoting to a lower particle size and higher sintering resistance. Therefore, the catalytic activity study confirmed the positive effect of the Sm addition to the Ni/SBA-15 sample due to higher Ni dispersion, strong metal–support interaction, and improved oxygen storage capacity. In contrast, a negative effect was observed over the catalytic performance of Co/SBA-15 after the addition of Sm attributed to the favoured Co oxidation and deactivation. Thus, at 700 °C, the medium catalytic results were obtained over 1 wt% Sm–10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 with 58–56% CH4 and 66–64% CO2 conversions over brief 5 h TOS while a small amount of filament type carbon deposition was observed (Table 12, entries 50 and 51).
– Effect of the addition of transition metals to Ni/SBA-15-based catalysts. Studies of the preparation of Ni–Co bimetallic catalysts showed the benefits of the formation of Ni–Co alloy that enhanced the catalytic stability in comparison to monometallic samples mainly due to the accelerated CH4 decomposition and prevention of Co0 oxidation.836,931 Accordingly, the catalytic performance of bimetallic Ni–Co/SBA-15 versus the monometallic catalyst for DRM was recently studied and revealed the positive synergetic effect between Ni and Co.932 The Co incorporation enabled preventing the sintering of Ni nanoparticles due to the formation of Ni–Co alloy that allowed avoiding the reoxidation of Co and reducing coke deposition. At 750 °C, up to 79% CH4 and 89% CO2 conversions were obtained over 4 wt% Ni–1 wt% Co/SBA-15 (Table 12, entry 52). Previously, the catalytic behavior of bimetallic Ni–Co/SBA-15 with 13 wt% Ni and different Co contents (N = wt%) was studied for the DRM reaction.933 The CO2 desorption results showed that Co doping improved the basic properties since three CO2 desorption peaks were recorded for the CN8 sample corresponding to weak (393 °C), moderate (527 °C), and strong (698 °C) basic sites (Fig. 93). The enhanced basicity will boosted CO2 adsorption and dissociation which would supply oxygen species to effectively improve the ability of CO2 in oxidizing carbon species formed from CH4 decomposition, and preventing coke formation. The optimum Co content existed, while Co excess favoured the formation of a large number of O species inducing Co0 oxidation and catalyst deactivation. Moreover, the morphology of carbon deposition varied with the presence of Co, besides on Ni/SBA-15 coke was present as shell-like inducing severe deactivation, on Co–Ni/SBA-15 coke adopted whisker form with a minor poisoning effect. Very good catalytic performance was obtained over the 2 wt% Co–13 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalyst, at 800 °C, with 76% CH4 and 90% CO2 conversions for the first 300 h of TOS and 80% CH4 and 80% CO2 conversion values for the following 500 h of TOS (Table 12, entries 53 and 54). A similar catalytic behavior was reported for bimetallic Ni–Co/SBA-15 prepared by a β-cyclodextrin modified impregnation method.934 The confinement of SBA-15 and Ni–Co synergetic effects enabled improving the activity and stability of Ni–Co/SBA-15 catalysts. The best catalytic performance was achieved over 4.5 wt% Ni–0.5 wt% Co/SBA-15 and 3 wt% Ni–2 wt% Co/SBA-15 with 90 and 88% CH4 conversions, and 95% CO2 conversion, respectively, at 800 °C for 30 h TOS (Table 12, entries 55 and 56).

The effects of titanium nitride (TiN) incorporation into Ni-SBA-15 by the hydrothermal method and further impregnated with Ni over textural and catalytic features were explored.935 Titanium nitride (TiN) presents interesting electronic properties, basic properties, high density, great surface area and high thermal and oxidation stabilities. The test of activity showed that both CH4 and CO2 conversions increased with Ni loading while the incorporation of TiN enhanced the catalytic activity of Ni-based catalysts owing to basicity improvement favourable to CO2 absorption and dissociation, and the creation of strong interaction between TiN, Ni and the support. The stability test showed that the presence of TiN allowed lowering carbon deposition. The moderate catalytic results were obtained with 70–65% CH4 and ∼70% CO2 conversions at 700 °C, over 10 wt% Ni/5 wt% TiN-SBA-15 for 12 h TOS (Table 12, entries 57–59).
Years ago, a DRM study of the catalytic activity of molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) revealed that these catalysts exhibited a high resistance to coke deposition similar to noble metals.936 The other report showed that the addition of a suitable Ni amount to MoO3 improved the Mo2C catalytic activity and stability for DRM.937 Based on these results, a Ni/Mo2C/SBA-15 catalyst was prepared by the impregnation of SBA-15 in order to take advantage of nickel deactivation by coke deposition to enable carbonaceous species migration onto Mo2C preventing Mo2C oxidation and accelerating carbon elimination.938 The Ni/Mo2C/SBA-15 catalyst exhibited very high catalytic performance along 130 h, with 98% CH4 and 95% CO2 conversions with a H2/CO ratio close to 0.8 at 800 °C (Table 12, entries 60 and 61). Nevertheless, besides these promising results, no further study was pursued.
– Effect of the addition of noble metals to Ni/SBA-15-based catalysts. Noble metals exhibit higher resistance against coke formation and sintering than Ni at high temperatures. Accordingly, the benefits of Rh doping over the catalytic performance of Ni-SBA-15 for DRM were explored. The comparison of the catalytic data of Ni/SBA-15 and Rh–Ni/SBA-15 samples showed the Rh promoting effect over catalytic activity and stability with a small Rh content (0.02 wt%) due to the electronic interaction between Ni and Rh enabling higher metal dispersion and improving NiO species reducibility. Moreover, the formation of Rh–Ni species promotes the activation and dissociation of CO2 with active oxygen release for the gasification of deposited carbon.939 At 650 °C, 66–59% CH4 and 79–78% CO2 conversions were achieved over 0.02 wt% Rh–10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 for 30 h TOS (Table 12, entries 62 and 63).
* Preparation of trimetallic Ni/SBA-15-based catalysts for DRM. The influence of the impregnation method in two or three steps and the Ce–Zr incorporation over the physicochemical and catalytic features of Ni/SBA-15 catalysts for DRM was explored. Owing to their redox properties, Zr and Ce generate high amount of oxygen vacancies near the Ni particle that favours carbon removal from the metallic surface. The catalytic study showed that Ce–Zr addition enhanced the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst selectivity and stability owing to the decrease of the Ni particle size and higher reducibility of NiO species.940 Over 6 wt% Ce–4 wt% Zr–10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 50–40% CH4 and 66–58% CO2 conversions were achieved along 30 h TOS, with a H2/CO ratio close to 0.78, at a low temperature (600 °C). Low 2 wt% coke deposition was determined owing to the high amount of Ce and Zr oxygen vacancies (Table 12, entries 64 and 65). The same group also reported the effect of the preparation method of Ce–Zr–Ni/SBA-15 following, one and two-step impregnation and co-precipitation routes over their physicochemical and catalytic properties.941 The Co-precipitation method allows achieving the sample with confined Ni phyllosilicate with a stronger metal–support interaction while by the impregnation method pore blockage occurred with Ni particles mostly located on the outer surface support. It was concluded that the catalyst prepared by co-precipitation did not favour methane decomposition, thus coke deposition was minimized and the catalytic stability was slightly improved, with 63–61% CH4 and 71–68% CO2 conversions with a H2/CO ratio of ∼0.85 maintained along 24 h TOS at 600 °C (Table 12, entries 66–68). A study of the benefits of the incorporation of CeO2 into the Ni–Mo/SBA-15 catalyst showed the high catalytic performance of both Ni–Mo/SBA-15 and CeO2–Ni–Mo/SBA-15 catalysts. CeO2–Ni–Mo/SBA-15 exhibited slightly higher activity and stability over 100 h, supporting the benefits of the CeO2 incorporation.942 CO2 desorption revealed three peaks and so three kinds of basic sites for the CeO2–Ni–Mo/SBA-15 sample, while N2 adsorption determined a higher specific surface area and pore volume for the CeO2–Ni–Mo/SBA-15 sample. These characterization data indicated that CeO2 lowered the acidity of the support preventing carbon formation by methane decomposition while basic sites enhance the adsorption and dissociation of CO2 and oxygen release to carbon gasification. Moreover, the CeO2 improved dispersion of the metallic active phase in SBA-15 and the reducibility of NiO particles (H2-TPR study). Then, 90% CH4 and 98% CO2 conversions with a H2/CO ratio of 0.9 were maintained over 100 h and no coke deposition was formed, at 800 °C over CeO2–Ni–Mo/SBA-15 (Table 12, entries 69 and 70). Few years ago, a study of the catalytic performance of Ni–Mo/SBA-15 doped with La2O3 revealed that the small amount of La2O3 allowed improving Ni dispersion and stability owing to the spatial confinement effects of SBA-15 mesopores and the creation of the strong interaction with the support, while the formation of La2O2CO3 favoured the elimination of carbon species from the catalytic surface preventing coke deposition (Fig. 81).943 Very good 92% CH4 and 96% CO2 conversions with a H2/CO ratio of 0.9 were maintained over long 200 h TOS in the presence of the Ni–Mo/SBA-15-La2O3 catalyst (Table 12, entries 71 and 72). Unfortunately, no data of H2 and CO selectivity were provided. The catalytic performance of Co–Ni/Sc-SBA-15 catalysts with 5 wt% Co, 5 wt% Ni and different Sc contents prepared by succesive impregnation was also reported for DRM.944 Co and Ni were successfully and highly dispersed in SBA-15 while the addition of Sc improved their resistance to sintering. The Sc incorporation allowed increasing the basicity of the catalyst and thus the adsorption and activation of CO2. Consequently the higher oxygen coverage enabled minimizing carbon formation due to easily oxidation into CO. Finally, Sc incorporation also improved the catalytic performance of Ni–Mo/SBA-15, and high 92–87% CH4 conversion and 93–92% CO2 conversion were maintained over 40 h with a H2/CO ratio close to 1 at 800 °C over the 5Co–5Ni/5Sc-SBA-15 catalyst (Table 12, entries 73–75).
* Effect of the basic properties of Ni/SBA-15-based catalysts for DRM. As aforementioned, the basic properties influence strongly the CO2 adsorption and dissociation, while the CO2 coverage of the catalytic surface allows avoiding CH4 adsorption and decomposition and favours carbon species oxidation. Therefore, the benefits of the basic properties of DRM catalysts have been largely investigated. Accordingly, the catalytic features of a series of MgO/SBA-15 catalysts prepared by one pot synthesis and further impregnated with the 10 wt% Ni and MgO–Ni/SBA-15 samples were compared.945 Through hydrothermal synthesis, MgO was successfully coated on SBA-15 walls while the mesoporous structure was maintained. It was shown that the coating of MgO enabled a decrease in the NiO particle size with higher dispersion, which provide more active sites for DRM. Morevover, MgO incorporation improved the surface basicity enhancing catalytic stability and coke resistance. A CO2-TPD study revealed the appearance of medium and strong basic sites on the Ni/8MgO-SBA-15 sample indicating the formation of superbasicity on mesoporous silica (Fig. 94). Thus, the best catalytic performance was obtained over 8 wt% MgO–10 wt% Ni/SBA-15 prepared by the one-pot method, with medium 71–68% CH4 and 66–62% CO2 conversions, at 800 °C over 40 h TOS (Table 12, entries 76–78). Carbon deposition was responsible for catalyst deactivation in the form of filamentous carbon species. At the same time, the preparation and catalytic performance of Mg-modified Ni/SBA-15 with different Mg loading contents were examined.946 Similar features and results were obtained. The Mg addition improved Ni dispersion and the basic properties of the catalyst owing to the strong metal–support interaction and consequently, coke resistance and catalyst stability. A H2-TPR study revealed a shift of reduction temperature of NiO to higher temperatures attributed to the strong Ni/support interaction due to the addition of Mg. Before the formation of NiO and MgO solid solutions with different compositions, new metallic phase/support interactions and changes in reducibility were reported.947 The enhanced basicity and high CO2 adsorption lowered the coke deposition reducing CO disproportionation and accelerating the oxidation of adsorbed carbon species. Thus, over 8 wt% Mg–10 wt% Ni/SBA-15, 58–66% CH4 and 62–57% CO2 conversions and H2/CO ∼ 1, at 700 °C, were reached over 40 h TOS (Table 12, entries 79 and 80).

* Effect of the morphology of Ni/SBA-15-based catalysts for DRM. A new breakthrough was recently performed with the synthesis of fibrous nanosilica such as KCC-1 and FZSM-5 that exhibit high area and micro- and mesopores, increasing the accessibility to active sites and improving considerably their catalytic and diffusion properties. Hence, recently, the successful preparation of spherical mesoporous Ni/dendritic fibrous SBA-15 (Ni/DFSBA-15) catalysts for DRM was reported.948 The catalytic data revealed that CH4 and CO2 conversions increased with Ni loading, with a maximum around 10 wt%, and further decreased. The characterization data showed that the NiO nanoparticle size increased with Ni loading while the BET area decreased. The best catalytic performance was achieved over 10 wt% Ni/DFSBA-15 with 93% CO2 and 91% CH4 conversions, 92% H2 and 96% CO selectivities and 0.95 H2/CO for 30 h TOS, at 800 °C (Table 12, entries 81 and 82). Recently, the same authors reported a study of the influences of operating parameters (reaction temperature, GHSV and CH4/CO2 ratio) over 10Ni/DFSBA-15 using mathematical modelling.949 The results indicated that the temperature had a determinant effect over CO2 conversion while the CH4/CO2 ratio mainly influenced the CH4 conversion and H2/CO. The predicted theoretical DRM allowed achieving high catalytic performance and stability over 30 h TOS. At 794 °C, both CH4 and CO2 conversions of 93–90% with a H2/CO ratio were obtained over the 10 wt% Ni/DFSBA-15 sample that could be regenerated under air (Table 12, entry 83). The in situ IR study determined that the DRM reaction involved the formation of unidentate (a) and bidentate (b) carbonate species as intermediates by CO2 adsorption and dissociation, while H2 and CO were issued of the reaction carbonate species with CH4 (Fig. 95).

* Conclusion. SBA-15 due to its high surface area and thermal stability is of interest to prepare Ni-based catalysts for the DRM process making use of the confinement effect of its mesopore system, and numerous works have been published. Different approaches have been followed to improve the dispersion and stabilization of nickel particles by the addition of a suitable promoter and establishing new metal/metal and metal/support interactions and synergies, to enhance the NiO reducibility, coke resistance, and control surface basicity to promote CO2 adsorption and dissociation. The results of Table 12 reveal the high activity of SBA-15-based catalysts although the yield or syngas cannot usually be assessed due to the lack of data on H2 and/or CO yield and/or selectivity. We have attempted to compare all catalysts considering CO2 conversion and H2/CO ratio as functions of GHSV and TOS. Then, some results can be highlighted as shown in Fig. 96 and 97. There, catalysts 12.5 wt% Ni/SBA-15, 1 wt% Ni/SBA-15 (800 °C), 7.5 wt% Ni/SBA-15(en), 7.5 wt% Ni/SBA-15(AE), 2 wt% Co–13 wt% Ni/SBA-15, 0.5 wt% Co–4.5 wt% Ni/SBA-15, Ni–Mo/SBA-15, 10 and 15 wt% Ni/DFSBA-15 (Table 12, entries 8, 9, 31, 32, 53, 55, 69, 81 and 82) exhibited interesting catalytic performance. Nevertheless, only for 12.5 wt% Ni/SBA-15, the 10 and 15 wt% Ni/DFSBA-15 data of H2 and/or CO2 yield and/or selectivity are given and so productivity can only be evaluated, with H2 and CO selectivities around 92–96%.

* Effect of the preparation method of Ni/MCM-41-based catalysts for DRM. Years ago, Ni–MCM-41 in which Ni ions were incorporated into the silica framework were prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis, in that case with a Ni loading of up to 3.9 wt%.673 The comparison of the catalytic data of Ni–MCM-41 catalysts issued from hydrothermal synthesis and by standard impregnation showed the improved catalytic properties for samples prepared by the hydrothermal method. The characterization of Ni/MCM-41 samples indicated a slight increase of the unit cell parameter when increasing the nickel content, supporting the framework incorporation of nickel. H2-TPR profiles did no depict any reduction peak before 360 °C confirming the absence of NiO crystals on the surface. Thus, a higher Ni dispersion and a lower particle size were reached with the sample prepared by the hydrothermal method. At 750 °C, 71–67% CH4 conversion was achieved with good catalytic stability over 30 h, in the presence of the 3.9 wt% Ni/MCM-41 sample prepared by hydrothermal synthesis (Table 13, entries 1 and 2). In a recent work, the effect of the spatial confinement of the MCM-41 mesoporous structure over Ni nanoparticle sintering resistance by varying Ni nanoparticle deposition methods and locations has been investigated.951 Thus, samples with Ni nanoparticles in the inner, outer and inner + outer surface were prepared. The characterization results disclosed the high dispersion of the Ni inner surface, owing to nanoparticle confinement, with a small size of around 2 nm, and the presence of strong metal–support interactions. Moreover, the TEM results and XRD patterns of spent catalysts indicated that the confinement effect of Ni particles inside the pores prevent both the sintering and carbon deposition on Niin particles and ensure the catalytic stability over long TOS. Therefore, the best catalytic performance was achieved over the 10 wt% Niin/MCM-41 catalyst, at 700 °C with 72–67% CH4 and 82–78% CO2 conversions and a H2/CO ratio around 0.78, which was maintained for at least 200 h (Table 13, entries 3–5). High resistance to sintering and carbon deposition were observed since the unconfined Ni/MCM-41 samples (10 wt% Niout/MCM-41, 10 wt% Niin+out/MCM-41) were deactivated within 12 h.

* Preparation of bimetallic Ni/MCM-41-based catalysts for DRM. Suitable metal doping could be a key to improve both the metal particle size and dispersion by establishing metal–metal and metal active phase/support interactions. Consequently, metal sintering and catalyst coke resistances should be enhanced. Moreover, the modification of surface basicity would improve the CO2 adsorption and dissociation unfavouring the CH4 adsorption and decomposition, promoting CO2 dissociation and the release of active oxygen species to boost the gasification of adsorbed carbon species.
Numerous papers disclosing different metal doping impacts of DRM catalysts have been published. For instance, a study of the benefits of Ga-doping over catalytic and textural features of 5 wt% Ni/MCM-41 showed an optimum Ga content, close to 2 wt% to maximise the catalytic performance and stability.952 Due to metal doping, H2-TPR profiles revealed that the reduction of nickel shifted at higher temperatures which was attributed to the strong metal–support interaction that improved Ni particle dispersion and low Ni particle size. A decrease in the amount of medium and strong basic sites was observed when increasing Ga loading, which was attributed to the formation of extra-framework acid sites. For Ga content <3 wt%, the catalytic results of the Ga-doped 5 wt% Ni/MCM-41 sample were superior to those of the un-doped sample and a maximum was observed for 2 wt% Ga–5 wt% Ni/MCM-41. High 90–85% CO2 and 88–83% CH4 conversions, for H2/CO close to 1 and 50% H2 selectivity, were achieved at 800 °C along 30 h TOS (Table 13, entry 6). Moreover, the doped catalyst exhibited higher resistance to coke deposition and Ni sintering. The Sc doping effect over 5 wt% Ni/MCM-41 physicochemical properties demonstrated that Sc loading induced a decrease in the surface area and catalytic activity of 5%Ni/MCM-41 catalysts.953 While Sc loading <1 wt% enabled an increase in CO2 conversion up to 38% for the 0.1 wt% Sc content. The presence of Sc small amount favoured the strong interaction between the metal and the support leading to higher dispersion of Ni nanoparticles and also increased the surface basicity. Therefore, enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation led to the presence of a high amount of active oxygen species promoting the oxidation of carbon species and lowering coke deposition. At 800 °C, the best catalytic performance was achieved over the 0.1 wt% Sc–5 wt% Ni/MCM-41 catalyst, achieving stable and high 87% CH4 and 85% CO2 conversions with a H2/CO ratio of 0.94 and a H2 yield close to 86%, along short 7 h TOS (Table 13, entries 7–9). Years ago, the impact of the incorporation of different transition metals (Zr, Ti, and Mn) into the silica framework over the catalytic and textural properties of Ni/MCM-41 samples prepared by the hydrothermal method was explored.954 The characterization data disclosed that higher Ni dispersion was achieved for Zr-doping in contrast to Ti- and Mn-doping. XRD patterns evidenced the presence of the amorphous silica matrix for Ni–Ti/and Ni–Mn/MCM-41 spent catalysts, suggesting that the Ti and Mn incorporations worsen the thermal stability of the MCM-41 silica support. In contrast, the presence of Zr cations in the framework stabilizes the MCM-41 structure. The catalytic performance of Zr-doped Ni/MCM-41 catalysts was similar or superior to the catalytic activity of the Ni/MCM-41 catalyst. In contrast, the decoration of Ni particles by TiOx and MnOx for Ti- and Mn-based Ni/MCM-41 catalysts hindered the accessibility to Ni-active centers and lowered their catalytic performance. Accordingly, Zr doped catalysts exhibited higher activity and stability and were maximum over 1 wt% Zr–2 wt% Ni/MCM-41, with maintained 92% CH4 conversion, H2/CO ratio close to 0.95, at 750 °C over 72 h TOS (Table 13, entries 10–13). However, neither any data of CO2 conversion nor H2 or CO selectivity were reported. A Gd doping study of 5 wt% Ni/MCM-41 prepared by the co-impregnation method revealed the improvement of CO2 adsorption and activation through the Gd2O2CO3 species formation similar to La2O2CO3 (Fig. 81) preventing coke deposition and also enhancing Ni reducibility.955 Over the 0.1 wt% Gd-promoted catalyst, high 88% CH4 and 92% CO2 conversions with H2/CO close to 1 were maintained over short 6.5 h TOS while carbon deposition was negligible (Table 13, entries 14–17). The catalytic performance of Ni/MCM-41 catalysts doped with Ru and Mg by impregnation showed that Ru incorporation improved the activity and stability of Ni/MCM-41 catalysts, being maximum H2 selectivity achieved over 1 wt% Ru@Ni/MCM-41, while Mg doping enhanced the 1 wt% Ru@Ni–MCM-41 catalytic performance increasing the CH4 conversion and limiting the RWGS reaction.956 However, low 31% CH4 and 37% CO2 conversions with H2/CO < 1 were achieved at 600 °C after 4 h of TOS (Table 13, entries 18–23). The TGA revealed coke formation with a high weight loss for all samples (45–65%) that did not particularly affected the catalytic activity of the catalyst over 4 h TOS, but induced the blockage of a reactor at longer 7 h TOS. The same group previously described a similar study of the preparation and catalytic performance of Ni/MCM-41 samples doped with Rh.957 Mono- and bimetallic MCM-41 catalysts were prepared either by Rh impregnation (Rh@Ni–MCM-41) or by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis (Rh–Ni/MCM-41). The optimum 0.19 Ni/Si ratio was determined achievieng low 31% CH4 and 41% CO2 conversions for 14 h at 600 °C (Table 13, entries 24–29). The Rh incorporation was shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability. However, the catalyst prepared by the impregnation method suffered higher coke deposition at longer reaction times. Earlier, a comparative study of the catalytic behavior of monometallic 20 wt% Ni/MCM-41 and bimetallic Pd–20 wt% Ni/MCM-41 samples demonstrated the promoting effect of Pd-doping on the activity and stability of 20 wt% Ni/MCM-41 catalysts owing to the synergetic effect between Ni and Pd improving Ni nanoparticle dispersion and reducibility.958 At 650 °C, over 0.3 wt% Pd–20 wt% Ni/MCM-41, the best catalytic results were achieved and maintained for 10 h TOS. Low 36% CH4 and 51% CO2 conversions with 19% H2 and 24% CO selectivities and a H2/CO ratio close to 1 were achieved (Table 13, entries 30–32). Despite their high thermal stability against sintering and the formation of coke, the doping of Ni/MCM-41 catalysts with noble metals did not provide much improvement neither in the catalyst resistance to coke formation and deactivation nor in the catalytic activity.
* Effect of the basic properties over the Ni/MCM-41-based catalyst activity for DRM. Suitable basic properties are well-known to allow CO2 adsorption and optimum catalytic coverage preventing CH4 decomposition and severe carbon deposition. Therefore, the addition of ceria, zirconia or magnesia positively modified the physicochemical properties of the support and improved not only CO2 adsorption but also the Ni interaction with the support enhancing Ni dispersion and stability. Following these leads, Y2O3–Ni/MgO–MCM-41 catalysts were successfully prepared by the one-pot synthesis method that revealed a suitable route to manage the uniform distribution of MgO, NiO and Y2O3 on the MCM-41 surface.959 The incorporation of MgO allowed improving the basicity while the incorporation of Y2O3 enabled promoting the reducibility and preventing the formation of an intermediate phase between Ni(Mg) and the support limiting Ni sintering. Moreover, the incorporation of Y2O3 enhanced the amount of oxygen vacancies favourable to CO2 adsorption, activation and dissociation lowering carbon deposition. A H2-TPR study showed a shift to a lower temperature of a broader NiO reduction peak, after Y2O3 incorporation, indicating that Y2O3 promotes nickel dispersion and strongly modifies the metal reducibility. Then, the best catalytic performance was achieved over 2 wt% Y2O3–Ni/MgO–MCM-41 with 71% CH4 and 84% CO2 conversions, 0.85 H2/CO ratio and with good stability over 20 h TOS at 750 °C (Table 13, entries 33 and 34). Coke deposition in the form of tip type of nanotubes caused almost no deactivation of the catalyst. Good catalytic results were reported but no data of Ni and MgO contents were provided.
* Conclusion. Similar approaches to SBA-15 were followed to develop improved DRM catalysts using MCM-41 as the support. Therefore, different attempts to improve the dispersion and stabilization of nickel particles by adding a suitable metal to control the surface basicity to promote CO2 adsorption and dissociation favouring carbon gasification were reported. The results in Table 13 summarise the catalytic data obtained in the presence of MCM-41-based catalysts for the DRM reaction at high temperatures. Considering GHSV, the reaction temperature and TOS, some results can be highlighted as shown in Fig. 98 and 99. High CO2 conversion and suitable H2/CO may be achieved; however the data of H2 and/or CO2 yield and/or selectivity are required to evaluate H2/CO productivity and the potential of the catalysts.

(iii) Conclusion. The main drawback of DRM is the high temperature required due to the endothermicity of the process, which not only results in high energy consumption that is not economically and environmentally sustainable, but is also incompatible with the reduction of CO2 emissions. Therefore, any industrial application must foresee the exclusive consumption of heat produced from renewable (sun, wind, and water) or nuclear sources. In addition to the high energy cost, the rapid deactivation of the catalyst must be overcome. The present review illustrates the high activity of the Ni-based zeolite and OMS catalysts, despite deactivation due to Ni sintering and coke deposition which, in turn, can plug the reactor in long-term tests. Thus, numerous attempts have been made to improve Ni-catalyst stability minimizing metal particle sizes, and improving metal dispersion and reducibility. The use of the high surface area support and second or multi metal-doping constitutes the main strategies, improving the metal–support interaction and modifying acid–base and redox properties. Thus, zeolites and OMSs offer opportunities for the development of the robust and efficient DRM catalyst. Unfortunately, most of the here referenced works remained far from an industrial implementation since the studies lack of the long-term stability test, catalytic regeneration study, and the process were performed at a high temperature (>750 °C) with catalytic performance close to thermodynamic equilibrium. The small pore size system of zeolites compared to mesoporous materials may be a weakness to reach a high dispersion of small metal nanoparticles and probably more prone to pore blockage due to metal sintering and/or coke deposition. Hence, the collection of references shows a greater number of studies exploring the potential of SBA-15 as the support fully supported by promising results that should make it a good candidate for the development of DRM catalysts. The high surface area, confinement effect of the mesoporous structure and thermal stability of SBA-15 should be a key to achieve high Ni nanoparticle dispersion and stability using the optimum preparation method and suitable metal promoters. Fig. 100 and 101 compare the best catalytic results reached over Ni-OMS and Ni-zeolite based catalysts compiled in the literature. Actually, the data of CO and/or H2 yield and/or selectivity are missing and would be necessary to validate this ranking where Ta–Ni/FZSM-5, 0.5 wt% Co–4.5 wt% Ni/SBA-15, 2 wt% Ga–5 wt% Ni/MCM-41, 1.5 wt% Zr–2 wt% Ni/MCM-41, 10 wt% Ni–10 wt% MgO/BEA, 10 wt% Ni/DFSBA-15, 5 wt% Ni–5 wt% Ce/ZSM-5, 1 wt% Ni/SBA-15 and Ni–Mo/SBA-15 exhibited the more relevant catalytic features considering the H2/CO ratio and CO2 conversion as functions of GHSV and TOS. Furthermore, the design of the DRM reactor alternating cycles of the reaction and catalyst regeneration should be a key.
 Fig. 100  H2/CO ratio was plotted versus TOS for different DRM zeolites and OMS-based catalysts. The ovoid highlights the best catalytic performance: H2/CO ratio close to 1 versus TOS. 
 Fig. 101  CO2 conversion was plotted versus GHSV for different DRM zeolites and OMS-based catalysts. The ovoid highlights the best catalytic performance: high conversion versus GHSV. 
On the other hand, the combination of POM and DRM processes constitutes a great strategy and challenge to overcome the main limitation of the energetic cost by taking advantage of the POM exothermicity. To date, the POM + DRM route has been insufficiently explored and even less in the presence of zeolite and OMS based materials.
To conclude, future approaches should focus on the structure and morphology of the DRM catalyst to improve the stability and dispersion of metal active species due to the confinement effect and on the elimination or prevention of coke formation. Therefore, to improve catalyst stability, a crucial approach must avoid coke formation by modifying the catalyst composition and incorporating active sites for rapid carbon oxidation. Thus, the properties of the DRM catalyst should be improved to tune the redox properties, enhance the dispersion and stabilization of metal active species, and maximize the oxygen mobility by incorporating suitable promoters. In addition, greater consideration should be given to the morphology of the support in order to disperse, stabilize and also isolate the metal species.
Following this, a special focus should be given to OMS materials, hierarchical zeolites due to their meso- and macroscale secondary porosity coupled with a microporous primary structure, two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets and core–shell materials to promote the physical isolation and shielding of the particles could be of interest.
Finally, the validation of catalytic activity and stability will be performed under realistic conditions for long TOS.


6.3 Dry reforming of alcohols (DR-alcohols). 
Synthesis gas (syngas) is the feedstock for a broad range of processes such as Fischer–Tropsch, MeOH and DME synthesis that in turn outline the worldwide market of fuels and chemicals. An additional source based on the renewable feedstock to produce syngas is the dry reforming (DR) or reforming with CO2 of alcohols providing from bio-resources (Fig. 102). In this context, bio-ethanol and glycerol issued from the biodiesel constitute ideal feedstock to effectively close carbon cycle providing valuable chemicals and using the main greenhouse gases, help mitigating the effect of anthropogenic CO2. In this sense, a recent mini review exposed the potential of DR of ethanol (DRE) and glycerol (DRG).960 Considering DRM to manufacture syngas, the main drawback is that CH4 is not a renewable feedstock in contrast to ethanol that constitutes an important substrate readily available from biomass (forest and agro-industrial wastes, energy crops). Moreover, from thermodynamics standpoints, DRE is favoured at a temperature higher than 318 °C, whereas DRM at a temperature above 600 °C. Thus, DRE may allow diversifying and making more flexible and sustainable the production of syngas. The production of glycerol is more limited although the DRG constitutes a great opportunity to value the main byproduct of biodiesel production. Despite the advantages of DRE and DRG, these represent emerging technologies poorly explored and several papers covered the use of zeolites and OMS based catalysts.

6.3.1 Dry reforming of ethanol (DRE). 
(a) Thermodynamics. 
A recent paper explored the thermodynamics of ethanol reforming with CO2.961 DRE is an endothermic process that involves numerous competitive and parallel reactions that determine the syngas yield and are influenced by different parameters such as the temperature, pressure and CO2/EtOH ratio. Ethanol can undergo dehydrogenation, dehydration and decomposition as well as the side products formed are involved in different secondary reactions. Some reactions of the complex reaction system are displayed in Scheme 65. In order to evaluate the impacts of some parameters of the reaction such as the temperature, CO2/EtOH, pressure and addition of inert gas over H2 and CO yields, a thermodynamic analysis via the Gibbs free energy minimization method was performed indicating that high H2 and CO yields up to 95 and 97% may be reached at a high temperature (900–1050 °C), with a CO2/EtOH molar ratio around 1 and atmospheric pressure, being the main reaction products CH4 and C with H2, H2O, CO and CO2, and the carbon formation favoured at low temperatures.961
 Scheme 65  Some parallel reactions involved in the complex DRE reaction system. 
(b) Catalysts for DRE. 
To make possible the development of viable DRE technology, the design and development of efficient, selective and robust catalyst is the key. Therefore, the addition of suitable promoters, multiple active phases maximizing the metal nanoparticle dispersion and stability through the strong metal/support interaction are crucial together with the design of optimized catalyst regeneration. As it occurs for dry reforming of CH4, Cu, Co, Rh and Ni supported solid catalysts have been largely used for DRE, being Ni the most explored metal because of its high activity, selectivity, availability and price, besides its rapid sintering and deactivation at high temperatures.962–965 Therefore, the choice of a suitable support with a high surface area and/or appropriate redox properties has shown to be crucial to achieve high NiO dispersion with a small particle size which give a Ni higher resistance to coke deposition and sintering. As discussed in this review, the addition of a suitable promoter (Zr, Ce, La, Mn, Co, and Mg) contributes to improve the activity and stability of Ni-based catalysts. In the bibliography, the catalytic activity of zeolite based materials for DRE has not been explored, while only two works described the catalytic performance of OMS based catalysts. The benefits of the incorporation of Ce in the SBA-15 structure have been widely described to promote the oxygen surface mobility owing to the special redox properties of Ce (Ce3+/C4+) and oxygen vacancy formation. Accordingly, the suitable catalytic performance of Rh/CeO2 has been demonstrated due to the interaction between Rh and CeO2 and the advanced properties of CeO2 for DRE.966,967 Following these leads, in 2009, the catalytic performance of Rh/Ce-SBA-15 catalysts prepared by impregnation of Ce-SBA-15 with different Ce/Si molar ratios issued from direct synthesis was explored.968 Firstly, the catalytic performances of 5 wt%-Rh, Ni, Co, and Pd supported on SBA-15 were checked, revealing the lower catalytic activity of 5 wt% Ni/SBA-15 exhibiting the higher catalytic activity of 5 wt% Rh–SBA-15. Moreover, a decrease of the metal content allowed improving the catalytic performance up to 470% exhibited by 1 wt% Rh/SBA-15 in comparison to 5 wt% Rh/SBA-15. Therefore, 1 wt% Rh/Ce-SBA-15 catalysts with a Ce/Si molar ratio ranging from 0 to 1 were prepared. The stability of the ordered mesoporous structure was affected by the incorporation of Ce and could be conserved for Ce/Si up to 1/5. The characterization data showed the optimum Rh nanoparticle dispersion and a lower particle size, 5–8 nm, for Ce/Si = 20, probably due to the strong metal–metal (Rh–Ce) interaction.969 The XPS analysis showed a shift to slightly lower binding energies of Rh (3d5/2) and Rh (3d3/2) of Rh0 with further incorporation of Ce (>1/20), indicating the formation of higher Rh particle sizes (Fig. 103), in agreement with the H2-TPR results that showed a shift of the reduction peak to a higher temperature, attributed to the decrease of the Rh dispersion. The activity over 1 wt% Rh/Ce-SBA-15 catalysts increased with a Ce/Si ratio from 0 to 1/20 attributed to the improved mobility of surface oxygen species because of the incorporation of Ce being the more suitable Ce/Si molar ratio equal to 1/20. Thus, at 750 °C, good catalytic performance was achieved over 1 wt% Rh/Ce-SBA-15 (Ce/Si = 1/20) with a H2/CO ratio around 1, CO2 conversion up to 76% and mole percentage of the gas product of 42% for H2 and CO, 14% for CO2, over 24 h TOS, with EtOH/CO2 = 1 and WHSV = 15594 h−1.

More recently, the catalytic performance of Ni/KIT-6 prepared by the methanol-assisted impregnation method was reported.970 The characterization results showed that the use of KIT-6 as the support enabled improving the dispersion and decreased Ni particle size owing to the confinement effect in comparison with Ni/SiO2. Therefore, smaller Ni particle sizes allowed preventing the coke formation, and the strong metal/support interaction lowered Ni sintering improving the catalytic stability and activity. Thus, at 550 °C, good catalytic performance was achieved over 14 wt% Ni/KIT-6 with a H2/CO ratio around 1.5, an EtOH conversion close to 100% and mole compositions of the gas product of 49% for H2, 32% for CO and 19% for CH4 along 40 h TOS, with EtOH/CO2 = 1 and GHSV = 40 L gcat−1 h−1.
(c) Conclusion. 
The catalytic results showed that almost complete conversion of ethanol can be achieved with almost H2 theoretical yield, making DRE a promising technology to produce syngas closing carbon cycle, and requiring solar or nuclear based heat sources in the same way that processes working at high temperatures, to ensure carbon neutrality. In the presence of OMS based catalysts good catalytic performance was achieved and similar to the best catalytic results achieved in the presence of 2 wt% Ir/CeO2 or 15 wt% Cu/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 that exhibited high catalytic stability over 70–90 h TOS.971,972 Since DRE is an emerging process, valuable mechanism insights are required. Molecular modeling and operando studies will be necessary for the design and ab initio synthesis of efficient and stable advanced catalysts to reach sustainable syngas manufacturing.
6.3.2 Dry reforming of glycerol (DRG). 
Glycerol is a byproduct of biodiesel production and constitutes a promising source for syngas production. Glycerol steam reforming and aqueous phase reforming are routes to produce syngas.973,974 Nevertheless, the high H2/CO ratio unfavourable for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis along with high CO2 production was reached, forcing to disregard this route.975,976 Thus, dry reforming of glycerol constitutes a promising alternative to produce syngas and solve glycerol crisis converting two wastes into valuable products.
(a) Thermodynamics. 
Following the equations of Scheme 66, 3 moles of H2 and 4 moles of CO per mole of glycerol can be produced by DRG, while direct glycerol decomposition can produce 4 moles of H2 and 3 moles of CO per mole of glycerol. Other reactions such as methanation of the WGS reaction can take place. From thermodynamic standpoints, the complete decomposition of glycerol is very likely. Since CO2 can be involved in DRG and converted into syngas, a study of CO2 conversion has been considered. Therefore, a thermodynamic analysis of DRG for H2 and syngas synthesis was performed with a total Gibbs free energy minimization method and the impact of different reaction parameters were explored.977 The maximum H2 and syngas yields are obtained at atmospheric pressure and are influenced by the CO2/glycerol ratio. Accordingly, up to 7 moles of syngas can be produced per mole of glycerol with a CO2/glycerol ratio of >3, while the H2 yield is the maximum for a CO2/glycerol ratio of <1. It was observed that the syngas yield increased with temperature and CO2/glycerol ratio, and the optimum reaction conditions are 727 °C and CO2/glycerol = 1. Under these conditions, 6.4 mol of syngas are produced by a mole of glycerol with H2/CO = 1 whereas coke deposition is thermodynamically prevented.
 Scheme 66  DRG and glycerol decomposition. 
(b) Catalysts for DRG. 
The data on dry reforming of glycerol are limited in the literature, and we found only one reference exploring the activity of Ni/SBA-15 catalysts.978 The most used catalysts for GDR, as it occurs for numerous CO2 conversion processes at high temperatures, are Ni-based catalysts due to the Ni lower price, high catalytic activity and availability. Besides Ni-based catalysts suffer high deactivation due to metal sintering and coke formation, different studies explored the catalytic performance of noble metals since they are more stable against sintering and coke formation at high temperatures.979 Moreover, the scientific community investigated and demonstrated that the incorporation of a second metal strengthens the metal (Ni)/support interactions that lower the physical migration of metal nanoparticles and also establish new metal–metal interactions providing new redox properties such as the doping of Ni-based catalysts with CaO, CeO2 or La2O3.980 Accordingly, the good and outstanding catalytic performance of the 3 wt% La-promoted alumina supported 20 wt% Ni catalyst, with a H2/CO ratio lower than 2, was reported.981 The syngas production was in a first stage attributed to the glycerol decomposition pathway and further to the RWGS and carbon gasification as described in the literature.964,982 Good catalyst stability and performance were recorded over 72 h TOS, at 750 °C, with a high 90% glycerol conversion and stable H2/CO = 1.2–1.7, with CO2/glycerol = 5. Recently, Re was added to Ni/CaO as the promoter for DRG, enhancing the H2 yield and glycerol conversion owing to the formation of acid sites favouring the adsorption of OH groups inducing an increase in the catalytic activity. Also, the reaction kinetic and characterization studies of Pt-Re/C catalysts for GDR indicated that Re improved the rate of glycerol reforming by reducing the binding energy of CO to Pt, leading to the lower coverage of the surface and higher accessibility to active sites by reaction intermediates and/or products, and additionally favours the WGS reaction and C–O bond cleavage (Fig. 104).
 Fig. 104  Benefits of the incorporation of Re to Pt/C catalysts owing to the formation of Re–OH species for catalytic reforming of oxygenated hydrocarbons. Reprinted with permission from ref. 979. Copyright 2008, Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 
Following these leads, the 15 wt% Ni/SBA-15 and 3 wt% Re–15 wt% Ni/SBA-15 samples were prepared by impregnation. The addition of Re improved NiO dispersion and allowed decreasing the Ni particle size. The study of the catalytic performance of 15 wt% Ni/SBA-15 and 3 wt% Re–15 wt% Ni/SBA-15 revealed a higher glycerol conversion of 57% and a higher hydrogen yield of 55% in the presence of 3 wt% Re–15 wt% Ni/SBA-15, at 700 °C, with CO2/glycerol = 1. The improvement of catalytic activity was attributed to the oxygen storage capacity and mobility of Re that enabled minimizing carbon deposition by gasification of carbon species. A study of reaction parameters showed that CO2/glycerol = 1 was the most suitable ratio while an increase in temperature enhanced competitive methanation and CO2 hydrogenation. No data about glycerol flow, GHSV or H2/CO were reported that makes difficult the performance evaluation.
(c) Conclusion. 
Dry reforming of ethanol and glycerol, while constitute promising routes to produce syngas, remains an emerging technology that requires knowledge and mechanistic insights into the design of efficient and robust catalysts to achieve sustainable syngas manufacturing. In particular, to solve the crisis of glycerol as the biodiesel by-product and valorize glycerol, the DRG may constitute an alternative route. However, considering the worldwide syngas production and consumption and the urgency in mitigating the CO2 emissions, the DRG would be an almost marginal alternative. Therefore, considering global syngas production, the DRE results are more attractive.

7 Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes using CO2
Although there have been great advances in the utilization of CO2 as a building block for chemical and fuel synthesis, there still exist several inherent drawbacks due to CO2 inertness and high thermodynamic and kinetic barriers that need to be overcome, requiring high-energy consumption and green hydrogen production which hinder its industrial implementation. An alternative technological method emerged in the 1990s based on the benefits of the use of CO2 as a soft oxidant and promoter in catalytic processes.983–985 Back then, the use of CO2 for dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene allowed reaching higher conversion while H2O and CO were the new reaction products in addition to H2 and styrene. These data indicated that the reaction underwent an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway in which CO2 was dissociated into CO and surface oxygen that can abstract hydrogen to form H2O (Scheme 67). Thus, CO2 constantly ensured the lattice oxygen supply and H2 elimination equilibrium switching (Le Chatelier's principle) via RWGS. Consequently, the use of CO2 as a soft oxidant to perform oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes presents three clear positive benefits with respect to catalytic dehydrogenation: enhances equilibrium conversion due to H2 conversion through RWGS, avoids olefin's side reaction due to partial blockage of the active sites by CO2 adsorption, and improves catalytic life due to coke removal by the Boudouard reaction. In addition, CO2, the main greenhouse gas, is reduced into CO, a more valuable chemical. Years ago, the oxidizing capability of different gases for coke gasification was explored and ordered as follows: O2 (105) > H2O (3) > CO2 (1) > H2 (0.003), illustrating the CO2 oxidative capacity in addition to heat capability.986 Thus, the use of CO2 as a soft oxidant may be a new breakthrough in CO2 utilization, considering that the global industrial CO2 use per year is about 230 Mt, while total anthropogenic CO2 emissions are about 38Gt; this highlights the high demand to convert CO2.987–990
 Scheme 67  Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes assisted by CO2. 

7.1 Introduction. 
Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes constitutes a powerful and widely applied one-step reaction in the industry, and provides hydrogen and olefins that are precursors of a huge variety of industrial products. Nevertheless, catalytic dehydrogenation is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic and requires a high temperature (550–750 °C) and a low paraffin partial pressure (0.1 MPa).991 In addition to coke formation because of high temperature, inducing catalyst deactivation and reactor clogging, the higher reactivity of olefins in comparison to alkane precursors leads to undesired side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, cracking and isomerization. Therefore, different approaches have been explored and the oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as a soft oxidant instead of oxygen as alternative emerged and strengthened, because of several advantages from energetic, thermodynamic and kinetic (rate of reaction, higher alkene selectivity) standpoints, such as the suppression of the over-oxidation of substrates and products, the reduction of carbon deposits and the use of CO2, the main greenhouse gas. Then, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes has been extensively investigated as an energy-saving and more environmentally friendly strategy to produce alkenes in the presence of MOx supported catalysts mainly with non-precious metals such as Ni, Fe, Co, Cr, La, Cu or V. The catalytic and textural properties of transition and rare earth metal oxides have been widely explored owing to their ability to perform the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes.983,988,990,992–994 Redox and acid/base properties play a fundamental role in the adsorption and activation of the reactants, in the dehydrogenation step, and in the regeneration of the oxidation state of the metal oxide catalyst (Fig. 105).
 Fig. 105  Scheme of different alkane ODH reaction pathways. 
7.1.1 Mechanistic insights. 
Efforts have been made to identify the intermediates of the reaction and establish reaction pathways by combining experimental and computational studies. Likewise, different reaction paths influenced by physicochemical properties were proposed for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation either involving lattice oxygen of metal oxide species further restored by CO2 reduction, or by combining simple dehydrogenation and RWGS, although different reaction pathways may be involved in the presence of the same catalyst (Fig. 105).
7.1.2 Role of redox properties. 
The redox sites of metal oxide catalysts are involved in the transfer of an oxygen atom from metal oxide to the hydrocarbon to complete oxidative dehydrogenation and the production of water. Therefore, the redox cycle is completed when reduced metal oxide is reoxidized by CO2, thus releasing CO. The mechanism is referred to as the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism and also redox or regenerative mechanism (Scheme 68).995–997
 Scheme 68  Role of redox properties of a metal oxide catalyst in the ODH of the alkane mechanism. 
7.1.3 Role of lattice oxygen. 
It was revealed that the presence of lattice oxygen in the oxides plays a fundamental role and is closely related to the redox properties. Indeed, the oxygen in the network allows the transfer of an oxygen atom from the metal oxide for the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane, with the consequent production of water and reduction of the oxidation state of the metal. Therefore, CO2 contributes to reoxidize the metal and restore the original metal oxidation state and oxygen lattice (Scheme 69).983,998
 Scheme 69  Role of lattice oxygen and CO2 in the ODH of alkane. 
7.1.4 Role of the acid/base sites. 
The presence of acid/base sites in metal oxide catalysts plays an important role in alkane and CO2 adsorption. Indeed acid sites collaborate in the activation of the alkane according to its nature (aromatic cycle) while the basic sites involve CO2 activation and hydrogen atom activation/abstraction. Furthermore, the acid/base properties influence the reaction pathway that can partially proceed by simple dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (Scheme 70).999–1001 On the other hand, the excess of acid sites can influence process selectivity and catalyze side reactions such as cracking, isomerization and condensation.
 Scheme 70  Role of acid/base sites in the ODH of the alkane pathway. 
7.1.5 Metal oxide based catalysts for the ODH of alkanes. 
The more widely studied catalytic systems for ODH are chromium, vanadium and iron based catalysts with suitable oxidation states that play a determining role in catalytic efficiency.
VOx-materials have been largely used as catalysts for alkane ODH owing to their activity and selectivity. The metal/support interaction and vanadium loading influenced the dispersion and stabilization as well as the nature of vanadium species.990,993,1002–1004 CrOx materials have also exhibited high catalytic activity and selectivity for alkane ODH owing to the multi-oxidation states of Cr.993,1005 Actually, the redox cycle and Cr active species are still controversial and different pairs have been proposed such as Cr6+/Cr3+ or Cr3+/Cr2+. Catalytic performance of Cr-based samples is determined by the nature and dispersion of chromia active species, in turn influenced by the content and support. The addition of second metals or promoters with specific redox or acid/base properties improves the catalytic performance of the catalyst due to the enhancement in metal oxide dispersion and stability, acid/base and redox properties that strongly influence the ODH pathway.983,989,1006,1007 The catalytic behavior of the synthesized catalysts also depends on the reaction conditions, and because a high reaction temperature is required, metal sintering and coke deposition induce rapid and severe deactivation, which has so far hindered industrial application. Thus, the research and development of new catalysts for alkane ODH with CO2 is a major challenge. In this context, zeolites and OMS due to their versatility in chemical composition, high surface area with a moldable pore size and variability in pore system structures offer opportunities to disperse and stabilize active metal oxides.


7.2 Styrene production by ethylbenzene (EB) ODH. 
The global styrene (ST) market varies with its widespread application as monomer in the synthesis of synthetic rubber, resins, plastics and mainly polystyrene and production of several other copolymers. The worldwide styrene market reached 43.3 B$ in 2019 corresponding to a production around 20 Mt year−1. ST is mainly produced by catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) using K-promoted iron oxide catalysts, in the presence of excess stream, at 600–700 °C and LHSV around 0.43 h−1.1008,1009 Due to the endothermic nature of the process (ΔH298K = 117.6 kJ mol−1), high energy consumption and temperature are required, resulting in coke formation and catalyst deactivation (Scheme 71). Therefore, different approaches have been studied and reaction coupling constitutes an effective approach to improve the equilibrium conversion.1010,1011 Accordingly, numerous investigations explored the reaction coupling of EB in the presence of CO2 instead of steam or O2 combined with RWGS. Therefore, the calculated consumption energy for ST production for the coupling process was 7.9 × 108 J t−1versus 6.2 × 109–7.9 × 109 J t−1 for current catalytic dehydrogenation. Thus, the oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as a soft oxidant as alternative emerged and strengthened because of several advantages from energetic, thermodynamic and kinetic (rate of reaction, higher ST selectivity) standpoints, avoiding the over-oxidation of alkane and consuming CO2, the main greenhouse gas.1012 Hence, the design and development of efficient and robust catalysts is very challenging, and thus EB oxidative dehydrogenation has been widely explored as an energy-saving and more environmentally friendly strategy to produce ST.
 Scheme 71  Thermodynamics of the ODH of ethane with CO2 as a soft oxidant. 
Transition and rare earth metal oxide based catalysts exhibit suitable catalytic activity and have been widely investigated. Fe,1006 V,990,1013,1014 Zr,1015 Ce,1016,1017 Mn,1018,1019 and Cr1020,1021 oxides exhibited appropriate catalytic properties to perform the oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2 of ethylbenzene.983,990 However, the rapid deactivation of the catalysts is an impediment to the industrial implementation and there is great interest in the design and development of efficient and robust ODH catalysts. To maximize the dispersion and stabilization of the metallic oxide phase, the great potential of microporous and mesoporous ordered materials as supports has been explored due to their high surface area, variability in the pore size system, versatility in their framework composition and textural properties, and high thermal and chemical stability.
7.2.1 Zeolite-based catalysts for EB ODH. 
The use of TiO2–ZrO2 binary oxides as catalysts and supports has found many applications in catalysis due to their excellent redox properties and oxygen storage capacity as it was illustrated along the present review.1022 Accordingly, an attempt of preparation and use as a catalyst for EB ODH of TiO2–ZrO2 oxides deposited onto mesoporous silicalite-1 (CS-1) was performed. First, metal hydroxide precipitated carbon nanoparticles were prepared by a pH controlled precipitation method of metal precursors onto carbon nanoparticles and further used for the hydrothermal synthesis of CS-1.1000 The characterization data showed the XRD pattern as a typical reflectance of MFI type zeolite while no reflectance of the crystalline phase of the TiO2–ZrO2 oxides was detected, indicating that no mixed oxide was occluded on the surface. The registered catalytic performance of TiO2–ZrO2/CS-1 revealed the better resistance of the supported catalysts; however, low catalytic results were achieved, at 650 °C, 30% EB conversion and 70–75% ST selectivity were maintained over 9 h TOS (Table 14, entries 18 and 19). The low selectivity was attributed to the higher amount of strong acid and base sites determined by NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD may be due to the formation of solid solutions (ZrTiO4).

The suitable catalytic properties of iron based catalysts for dehydrogenation reaction have been demonstrated.1008,1023,1024 Accordingly the preparation and use as catalysts of Fe3O4/ZSM-5 samples with different metal loadings for EB ODH were explored.1025–1027 The catalytic results showed the efficient dispersion of iron oxide over the high ZSM-5 surface area and activity towards CO2 dissociation into CO and oxygen active species to enable RWGS. This enhanced activity was attributed to oxygen deficiency of the supported Fe3O4 and the presence of Fe2+ species. Nevertheless, at 600 °C, low 42% EB conversion and 89% ST selectivity were achieved (Table 14, entries 20–22). The addition of a promoter constitutes an efficient strategy to tune the redox properties and enhance the catalytic activity of metal oxide supported samples.1028,1029 In this sense, the addition of K has been reported to enhance the rate of carbon gasification from an iron oxide catalyst, and extensive studies have determined the formation of potassium monoferrite (KFeO2) on magnetite bulk (Fe3O4) as the active site for dehydrogenation.1030–1032 Accordingly, Fe2O3 supported ZSM-5 type chromosilicate (F/CS) samples were prepared following the solid-state dispersion method of different γ-Fe2O3 loadings in the structure of K or Na chromosilicate samples, KCS and NCS, respectively.1033,1034 The catalytic results confirmed the critical role of K as a promoter besides Cr and the synergetic effect between both metals to improve the catalytic activity, with a higher influence than with Na. Moreover, the impacts of Fe2O3 addition over catalytic activity depended on loading and it can be noted that, firstly, ST selectivity increased and further decreased. Therefore, at 600 °C, highest 92% and 96% ST selectivity for 5% and 10% Fe2O3 loadings over KCS and NCS support, respectively, was reached. Up to 51% ST yield and 96% ST selectivity were achieved over 10 wt% Fe2O3/NCS catalyst. However, the potassium chromosilicate support before washing (KCSBW) exhibited the best catalytic performance with 56% ST yield and 96% ST selectivity (Table 14, entries 23–25). Accordingly, the synergetic effect between Cr and K was considered more effective than the synergetic effect between Fe and K. In contrast, Fe2O3 addition to NCS revealed the synergetic effect between Fe and Na, promoting the catalytic activity with greater magnitude than that of the NCS support. Stability study demonstrated a slight EB conversion decrease from 58 to 56% after the first three runs because of coke deposition that could be recovered after calcination on the active sites of the catalyst.
7.2.2 OMS-based catalysts for EB ODH. 
(a) Monometallic OMS-based catalysts for EB ODH. 
V-supported catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity towards styrene formation, the high dispersion and oxidation state (V5+) of vanadium species being the key parameters.1013,1035 In particular, V-supported on activated carbon,1036,1037 Al2O3,1038,1039 and MgO,1035,1040,1041 at 530–600 °C and 0.1 MPa allowed reaching high catalytic performance, while the addition of suitable promoters such as Cr, La or Mg resulted in increasing the activity.1042 A recent DFT study revealed that ethylbenzene dehydrogenation takes place on the vanadyl oxygen O(1) site of the V2O5(001) surface with H2O formation to H2 elimination with abstraction of O vacancy on the V2O5(001) surface. Nevertheless, because of the high activation energy (3.16 eV), CO2 is not able to properly restore the oxygen vacancy leading to progressive catalyst deactivation.1043 As the support is the key to improve catalyst stability, highly dispersed V supported Al-MCM-41 (V/Al-MCM-41) catalysts were prepared.1044 The catalytic study for EB ODH showed an increase in the catalytic activity with V loading increase up to 6 wt% owing to high coverage and dispersion of low polymeric VOx species, and further decrease due to V2O5 crystallite formation. UV-Raman spectroscopy of the different samples showed bands at 341 and 914 cm−1 assigned to the bending mode of the V–O–V bond and the symmetric O–V–O stretching of polymeric vanadia species; the band at 1018 cm−1 was assigned to the symmetric stretching mode of the VO bond of the isolated tetrahedral VO4 species anchored on AlMCM-41, while the band at 996 cm−1 indicated the formation of V2O5 and increased with the V content (Fig. 106). Moreover, the Al-MCM-41 support showed to improve VOx species dispersion in comparison to the Si-MCM-41 support and stabilization of V5+ active species owing to stronger metal–support interaction. The catalyst deactivation was mainly attributed to the reduction of V5+ into V3+, while the coke deposition did not alter catalyst stability. High ST selectivity was reached at 550 °C over 20 h TOS, with a good 58–48% EB conversion (Table 14, entries 1 and 2).

Years ago a study of the catalytic behavior of VOx/Al-MCM-41 revealed similar tendency.1045 1.0 mmol g−1 V−1 loading was determined to be optimal for the formation of isolated and monolayer polymeric VOx species over AlMCM-41. Therefore, 50% ST yield and 97% ST selectivity were reached at 550 °C (Table 14, entry 3). Previously, a high catalytic activity of VOx/Si-MCM-41 with 1.5 mmol g−1 V−1 optimum loading was described,1046 and similar conclusions were reported. The dispersion and the nature of VOx species depended on the V loading. Moreover, two reaction pathways for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation were displayed: direct oxidative dehydrogenation of EB with CO2 (40%) and combination of simple dehydrogenation of EB with RWGS. 70% ST yield and 98% ST were obtained at 550 °C (Table 14, entry 4). Interesting catalytic activity of VOx/MCM-41 was reported; however, low catalytic stability was reached, and no catalyst regeneration and recycling study was performed.
Bimetallic La2O3–V2O5/MCM-41 catalysts with different V and 10 wt% La content were prepared by impregnation and tested for EB ODH.1047 The benefits of the addition of a second metal over the V dispersion was shown while the nature of VOx species varied with V loading, and the polyvanadate formation occurred for a high V content (20 wt%). Moreover, V loading affects surface acidity. The NH3-TPD spectra revealed the presence of VO43− acid sites in the 15V/MCM-41 sample that affects the activity of the catalyst and induces EB and ST cracking. For V loading below 15%, uniform La2O3 and V2O5 dispersion was reached. The key role of La2O3 to effectively lower coke deposition owing to CO2 adsorption and stabilization into La2O2CO3 has been fully described. Moreover, the addition of La2O3 allowed improving the rate of VO32− oxidation due to the presence of an oxygen lattice that can be ensured by CO2 adsorption and dissociation via La2O2CO3. Then, an enhancement of EB conversion over 10La15V/MCM-41 was observed in comparison to 15V/MCM-41. At 600 °C, high catalytic performance was obtained over 10 wt% La–15 wt% V/MCM-41 and attributed to the high specific surface area, the large pore volume and the optimized La/V ratio. Thus, EB 86.5% conversion and 91% ST selectivity after 4 h TOS were achieved and 75% EB conversion was maintained after 12 h TOS (Table 14, entries 5 and 6). Nevertheless, carbon deposition induced catalyst deactivation. The same group published a similar work reporting the catalytic performance of bimetallic LaVOx/SBA-15 samples with different V contents showing the importance of the nature of VOx species and dispersion controlled by V loading.1048 The addition of La allowed preventing the carbon deposition and improving catalytic stability. The synergism between La and V enhanced the catalytic performance of V-catalysts which was maximized over 10 wt% La2O3–15 wt% V2O5/SBA-15 sample owing to the presence of VO43− active species, achieving 74% ST yield, at 600 °C (Table 14, entries 7 and 8). The catalyst was regenerated under air calcination at 550 °C. Promising catalytic behavior for EB ODH was reported; nevertheless, studies of long-term stability and regeneration of the catalysts are required to evaluate their potential.
Even if the catalytic behavior of Cr-based catalysts for alkane ODH has been widely explored, few examples were reported in the literature using micro- and mesoporous ordered silicates as the support for EB ODH. One study investigated the catalytic performance of Cr/MCM-41 catalysts prepared by the direct hydrothermal synthesis for EB ODH. The catalytic data showed an increase of the catalytic activity with Cr loading until 1.7 wt%.1021 Specifically, Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination was determined as active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as inactive polychromate species inducing the catalyst deactivation. A regeneration study under oxygen allowed recovering the catalytic activity. Mechanistic insights revealed that CO co-formation with ST and H2 disappearance confirmed that RWGS took place over Cr-MCM-41. It was concluded that ST was produced following two pathways, direct ODH of EB with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of EB combined with RWGS. High 70% ST yield and 98% ST were obtained at 550 °C (Table 14, entry 9).
(b) Bimetallic OMS-based catalysts for EB ODH. 
The catalytic performance of bimetallic CoFe2O4/MCM-41 catalysts prepared by impregnation and compared with that of Fe2O3/MCM-41 was recently reported.1049 The characterization data (XRD, Raman, Mössbauer and XPS) revealed the structural properties and environment of Fe and Co, and the formation of partially inverted Co ferrite where Co2+ and Fe3+ occupy both octahedral and tetrahedral positions. The catalytic data demonstrated the superior selectivity and stability of the CoFe2O4 phase compared to Fe2O3 owing to high thermal stability of the structure. Mechanistic insights indicated that EB adsorption occurred preferentially over Fe3+ sites than Co2+ and preferentially dehydrogenation took place on the octahedral sites in comparison to the tetrahedral sites. 30% ST yield and 99% ST selectivity were maintained at 550 °C along 5 h TOS (Table 14, entries 10 and 11). Low catalytic performance was reached and insufficient data were provided to estimate the production.
The use of CeO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides as catalysts and catalyst supports has found many applications owing to their excellent redox properties and oxygen storage capacity as discussed in this review.1050–1052 Therefore, for alkane ODH, the catalytic activity of CeO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides has been widely explored and it was shown that their catalytic performance depended on textural and physicochemical properties, the main drawback being the structure stability at high temperatures. Therefore, a strategy for the dispersion and stabilization of CeO2–ZrO2 mixed oxides over a high area support is required. Following these leads, the catalytic performance of CeO2/ZrO2 pure oxides, mixed oxides and supported mixed oxides on SBA-15 prepared by precipitation, co-precipitation and precipitation-deposition methods was explored.1053 The characterization data showed that the BET surface area of the supported catalyst was lower than that of original SBA-15 and decreasing with increasing loading due to pore blockage. XRD patterns displayed that the SBA-15 structure was mostly maintained with a slight structural ordering decline, whereas no XRD reflections were determined for the supported CeO2–ZrO2 phase suggesting that no crystalline phase of the mixed oxide was formed. The catalytic results revealed an enhancement of the catalytic activity due to the synergetic effect between Zr and Ce compared to individual bulk oxide but no specific characterization data (H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, Raman) were studied. CeO2–ZrO2/SBA-15 exhibited good and stable catalytic activity, showing the potential of SBA-15 as a support, with 65% EB conversion and 93% ST selectivity maintained over 10 h TOS, at 650 °C (Table 14, entries 12–14).
(c) Effect of the preparation method of OMS-based catalysts on EB ODH. 
It is well known that the preparation method can strongly affect the metal structure and dispersion that in turn influence the catalytic activity and selectivity. Accordingly, M/MCM-41 (M = Co, Cu, Cr, Fe or Ni) following impregnation (IM) and isomorphic substitution (DM) methods were prepared.1054 Depending on the preparation procedure, cationic (Cu2+, Co2+, and Cr4+/Cr3+) or metal oxide species were detected in the MCM-41 structure or dispersed on the MCM-41 surface, respectively. H2-TPR analysis showed that isomorphically substituted samples were difficult to reduce, except Ni- and Fe-containing catalysts, whereas impregnated (MeOx) catalysts possessed more easily reducible species (Fig. 107). Consequently, the isomorphically substituted catalysts exhibited superior catalytic performance than the impregnated series, according to the following activity order: Ni(DM)/MCM-41 > Fe(DM)/MCM-41 > Cr(DM)/MCM-41 > Co(DM)/MCM-41 > Cu(DM)/MCM-41, with modest 52% ST selectivity achieved over Ni(DM)/MCM-41 and maximum 93 and 95% ST selectivity reached over Fe(DM)/MCM-41 and Cr(DM)/MCM-41, respectively, at 550 °C (Table 14, entries 15–17). Moreover, Ni2+ and Fe3+ MCM-41 framework, as well as NiOx and Fe2O3 extra-framework species were continuously oxidized by CO2 ensuring the regeneration and availability of active sites for EB dehydrogenation. CO2 plays a vital role in preserving the lattice oxygen on the catalyst surface. Study of deactivation revealed that the coke nature influenced the catalytic stability, and polyaromatics formation over Ni0 active sites was responsible for catalyst deactivation.

7.2.3 Conclusions. 
The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant offers several advantages to ensure and enhance the catalytic activity due to its ability to activate ODH directly promoting EB ODH or by combination of alkane dehydrogenation and RWGS, thus favouring thermodynamics. The catalytic results showed that high ST selectivity could be reached at a good conversion level with OMS based catalysts (V/ and Cr/MCM-41, La-V/MCMC-41 and SBA-15) (Fig. 108 and 109). Nevertheless, catalyst lifetime was insufficiently studied to improve the stability and regeneration opportunities. More efforts should be spent to study catalyst robustness and reactor configuration to achieve and maintain high EB yield and selectivity offering SBA-15 support great potential. Despite their better thermal stability and robustness, zeolites because of smaller pore size may present some limitation to efficiently and homogeneously disperse metallic oxides, with high amounts of active species and metal loading. Hence, future study should focus on the benefits of hierarchical zeolite application due to its meso- and macroscale secondary porosity, together with the microporous primary structure, two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets and core–shell materials to improve the accessibility to the active center and mass transfer. In addition, OMS owing to their large pore structure offer great opportunities to prepare catalysts with high metallic phase dispersion and sintering stability owing to the confinement effect of the mesopores and strong interaction metal/support, combined with thermal stability.

7.3 Ethylene production by ethane ODH. 
7.3.1 Introduction. 
Ethylene is a major chemical building block with worldwide production. Moreover, it is also the largest olefin on the market, derived from petroleum, and used as feedstock for the commercial production of intermediates and polymers such as ethylene oxide, ethylene dichloride, ethyl benzene, polyethylene, etc. The global production of ethylene amounted to 191.5 Mt in 2019 and is expected to increase up to 283 Mt in 2024. Ethylene is mainly produced by steam cracking of hydrocarbons like natural gas and naphtha at high temperatures, with strong drawbacks such as high energy consumption, rapid coke formation and CO2 emissions.1055–1057 Thus different alternative processes for ethylene production have been explored such as ethanol dehydration based on biomass and sustainable feedstock or the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane.1058,1059 In the last decade, the ODH of alkanes strengthened since it offers several advantages from kinetics and environmental standpoints.1060 Dehydrogenation is an endothermic process which in the presence of oxygen becomes exothermic, since the produced H2 is removed by oxidation into water and the equilibrium shifted (Scheme 72). However, the flammability of ethane, exothermicity of the reaction, over-oxidation of ethylene, the hazardous use of pure oxygen and probable hotspot formation hampered the industrial implementation. Therefore, the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant constitutes an alternative to produce ethylene and consumes anthropogenic CO2 and lengthens catalyst life minimizing coke deposition. Nevertheless, the lack of efficient and robust catalysts delayed the industrial application, with the industry requirement being an ethylene productivity of > 1 gC2H4 gcat−1 h−1, at a temperature as low as possible.1059,1061

7.3.2 Zeolite based catalysts for ethane ODH. 
(a) Cr/zeolite-based catalysts for ethane ODH. 
Years ago, the catalytic activity of different transition metal oxides (Cr, V, and Ga) supported on protonic zeolites prepared by impregnation was explored.1062,1063 The surface acidity of zeolite plays a crucial role in chemical transformation, and for the ethane ODH the following activity order was obtained: Cr/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 850) > Cr/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 95) > Cr/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 45) > Cr/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15). These results showed the impact of the Si/Al ratio and acid properties over the nature of Cr active species. The initial rate of ethylene formation was 1.6 times higher over Cr/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 850) than over Cr/SiO2 while Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, with a lower Si/Al ratio, exhibited low activity. On the other hand, Ga and V/ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 850) showed low activity for ethane ODH. TPR-spectra showed the presence of a reduction peak at high temperature (∼450 °C) assigned to the high oxidation state Cr species (Cr(VI)) with a key role in dehydrogenation activity. The authors also claimed the CO2 importance in the re-oxidation of Cr3+ species into Cr6+ active species and in removing coke from the catalytic surface, thus prolonging the catalyst life. At 650 °C, the maximum rate of the formation of ethylene was 0.516 mmol gcat−1 min−1 with 28% and 90% ethylene yield and selectivity (Table 15, entry 45). More recently, a series of submicron Cr/ZSM-5-supported samples were prepared by impregnation of ZSM-5 with submicron size and their catalytic and textural properties were explored.1064 XPS study allowed analyzing the two oxidation states of Cr species, and the deconvolution of the Cr2p2/3 spectra enabled obtaining two bands at 576.5 and 579.5 eV, assigned to Cr3+ and Cr6+, respectively, and determining a decreasing Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio when Si/Al increased and Na content decreased. These results showed the importance of zeolite framework composition and sodium presence on the nature of chromium species. The catalyst stability increased with the Si/Al ratio while Na samples exhibited superior catalytic performance than the protonic one. It has been widely described that the nature of chromium oxide is crucial and that crystalline Cr2O3 exhibits low activity while oligomeric chromium species are more active than isolated ones. Therefore the difference in activity for Cr/NaZSM-5 and Cr/HZSM-5 was attributed to the presence of dispersed Cr(VI) species in the form of polymeric chromates and monochromates in Cr/NaZSM-5 and to the presence of crystalline Cr2O3 in Cr/HZSM-5, determined by laser Raman spectroscopy. An optimum value of Cr close to 3 wt% was found. The best catalytic performance was achieved over 3 wt% Cr/NaZSM-5 (Si/Al = 160), at 650 °C, with initial 65% ethane conversion and 49% ethylene yield and good catalytic stability with practically constant 46% ethylene yield over 50 h TOS (Table 15, entries 46–48). A recent work reported an attempt of CO2 capture and utilization for ethane ODH in two stages, by combining in a fixed-bed reactor a physically mixed adsorbent and catalyst, composed of a double K–Ca salt and a Cr-impregnated H-ZSM-5 zeolite.988 A CO2 adsorption study revealed that K–Ca exhibited the highest CO2 uptake (5.2 mmol g−1) while characterization-activity results of Cr/H-ZSM-5 samples revealed an optimum 10 wt% Cr loading, with the highest TOF number and the lowest Cr surface density. The combined capture utilization process consisted first of CO2 adsorption at 600 °C, with 10% CO2/Ar, followed by the ethane ODH reaction at 700 °C with 5% C2H6/Ar. With GHSV = 5000 mL g−1 h−1, a (K–Ca)/(Cr10/HZSM-5) ratio of 1, 25% ethane conversion, 88% and 22% ethylene selectivity and yield and 14% CO2 conversion were achieved. Nevertheless, catalytic stability and adsorption studies revealed a constant deactivation of the catalyst and decrease of CO2 adsorption capacity due to adsorbent particle sintering and reduction of Cr active species (Cr6+) (Table 15, entry 50).

Recently, a series of 5 wt% Cr/clinoptilolite samples were prepared by impregnation. Therefore, the benefits of post-synthesis treatment with NH4NO3 and/or HNO3 over the textural and catalytic properties of Cr-Clinoptilolite samples were explored. Different treatments were applied to natural clinoptilolite zeolite (CLT-R) with NH4NO3 (CLT-A), with (CLT-A) and with NH4NO3 + HNO3 (CLT-IA).1065 The catalytic and characterization data revealed that clinoptilolite treatments constituted an efficient and attractive strategy to provide Cr-supported clinoptilolite catalysts with a higher surface area and a lower particles size owing to cation exchange and dealumination, leading to higher dispersion and smaller particle size of Cr. Moreover, a decrease in surface acidity was observed due to dealumination and resulted favourable to ethylene desorption, and promoting ethylene selectivity. Therefore, the benefits of acid treatment coupled with NH4NO3 treatment were shown and, at 700 °C, the better catalytic results were obtained over 5 wt% Cr/CLT-IA with 39% ethylene yield and 99% ethylene selectivity, over 5 h TOS (Table 15, entries 50–53).
(b) Zn/zeolite-based catalysts for ethane ODH. 
The catalytic behavior of highly dispersed Zn-based SSZ-13 (NaS50) zeolite with different Zn contents was explored for ethane ODH.1066 The catalytic data revealed that conversion was correlated with Zn loading, indicating that Zn constituted the single active site of the catalyst. The catalytic activity of zeolites based on Zn with different structures was compared and the superior 2.9 wt% Zn/NaS50 catalytic performance stood out. The following activity order was established, NaS50 > NaZSM-5 > MCM-22 > NaY, interestingly opposite to the size of the pore diameter order SSZ-13 (0.38 Å) < ZSM-5 and MCM-22 (0.55 Å) < Y (0.78 Å), indicating that zeolites with a small pore opening favoured CO2 diffusion and adsorption. Then, DFT and operando studies were performed to determine the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over Zn catalysts, considering two types of active sites based on the EXAFS data, [Zn–O–Zn]2+ and Zn2+, corresponding to zinc oxide and zinc ion located on SSZ-13 zeolite. The proposed C2H6 dehydrogenation mechanism involves two parts that are C2H6 activation and C2H4 desorption, and hydrogen desorption. Thus, C2H6 dehydrogenation involves the first C–H cleavage leading to the formation of Brønsted acid zinc hydroxyl group (ZnOH) while the second C–H bond cleavage leads to the formation of Zn–H. Therefore the elimination of hydrogen was envisioned by H2 desorption, the most energy demanding step over both the considered active sites, or by CO2 addition on the Zn–H moiety to form Zn–COOH with further formic acid desorption that constitutes a lower energy demanding step (Fig. 110). However, operando dual-beam Fourier transform infrared spectrometry results revealed that ethane ODH mechanism is similar regardless of the presence or absence of CO2, although stretching vibration in the region of 2385–2296 cm−1 typical of HCOO− was recorded in the presence of CO2, supporting the DFT calculations and the formation of formic acid to remove hydrogen.

A catalytic stability test, over 200 min, revealed a good and stable 0.9 wt% Zn/NaS50 catalytic performance, with 30% ethane conversion and 95–98% ethylene selectivity, while 2.9 wt% Zn/NaS50 suffered deactivation due to carbon deposition (Table 15, entries 54 and 55).
7.3.3 OMS-based catalysts for ethane ODH. 
(a) Cr/OMS-based catalysts for ethane ODH. 
Even though several catalytic system based on transition metal oxide were explored, silica-supported chromia revealed to be a more suitable ethane ODH catalyst with CO2, with up to 56% ethane conversion and 93% ethylene selectivity at 650 °C.1067 Nevertheless, the catalytic performance remained insufficient for commercial application,1068 and the chromium dispersion and stability represent the bottleneck to maximize the catalytic activity and life.1069–1071 Chromium oxide based materials constitute promising catalysts for ethane ODH and the chromium species nature and dispersion are of paramount importance. Cr6+ was determined as the most active species, and optimum and uniform dispersion as monolayer coverage allows avoiding the formation of polymeric species, which are less active and selective. Therefore, the use of OMS and zeolites as supports, owing to their surface area, thermal stability and versatility in framework composition, offers great opportunities to reach maximum chromia dispersion and stabilization to the design and development of efficient and robust ODH catalysts. The impact of the preparation method on metal dispersion and particle size has been widely reported since they in turn affect the catalytic properties of the prepared catalyst. Accordingly, the importance of the addition sequence of chromium and silica precursors on the textural and catalytic properties of Cr/MCM-41 materials with different Cr loadings was explored, with Cr-TEOS or TEOS-Cr indicating the order of addition of the precursors, i.e., chromium and silica and, silica and chromium, respectively.1072 TEM results revealed that the TEOS-Cr addition order provided mesoporous silica with a very small nanoparticle size while the SEM study indicated higher CrOx species dispersion with a maximum Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio obtained for 8 wt% Cr/MCM-41-Cr-TEOS sample. In concordance with the characterization data, the best catalytic performance was achieved over 8 wt% Cr/MCM-41-Cr-TEOS sample with 58% ethane conversion and 53% ethylene yield at 700 °C (Table 15, entries 1–7). Previously, a study of the catalytic performance of Cr/MCM-41 catalysts with different Cr contents, prepared by the impregnation method, revealed that an optimum chromium content of 8 wt% allowed reaching higher chromium species dispersion with monolayer coverage on MCM-41, smallest particle size and high surface area and optimum redox properties.1073 Similar results were reached and 56% ethane conversion and 94% ethylene selectivity were obtained over 8 wt% Cr/MCM-41, at 700 °C (Table 15, entries 8–11). Earlier the catalytic activity of Cr/MCM-41 for ethane ODH was reported.1074,1075 Characterization study determined the partial framework insertion of Cr into MCM-41 and Cr dispersion on the support MCM-41 surface, while Cr6+ and Cr3+ were determined as the catalytic active site. Ethane ODH involved the reduction of the Cr6+ sites by ethane dehydrogenation and the reoxidation of Cr3+ by surface oxygen species issued from CO2 dissociation or by CO2. The best catalytic performance was achieved over 5 wt% Cr/MCM-41 catalyst with 43% ethane conversion and 87% ethylene selectivity at 700 °C (Table 15, entries 12–14).
The benefits of sulfate modification of the silica support have been reported for the preparation of active ODH Cr-based catalysts.1067 The surface acidity has been reported as a key parameter to activate alkane and strongly influenced the catalytic performance of ODH catalysts, and the sulfatation showed to enhance the catalytic activity of the Cr/SiO2 catalyst but induced a slight decrease in ethylene selectivity. Accordingly, a chromium sulfate modified SBA-15 material with 6% sulfate and 5% Cr (5 wt% Cr/S-SBA-15) was prepared by impregnation.1076 TEM images indicated that sulfation induced a higher and homogeneous dispersion of Cr species in the monolayer and with smaller particle size, while XPS and Raman spectra revealed an increase of the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio after sulfate modification which drastically influenced the catalytic activity. The TPR profile showed a shift of the reduction peak towards higher temperature, attributed to stronger interaction between Cr species and SBA-15, leading to higher dispersion. Consequently, the catalytic performance was higher over 5 wt% Cr/S-SBA-15 in terms of conversion and selectivity but remained lower than 5 wt% Cr/SiO2 where 56% ethane conversion and 93% ethylene selectivity were achieved at 650 °C.1067 At 650 °C, 61% ethane conversion and 82% ethylene selectivity were reached over 5 wt% Cr/S-SBA-15, while 45% ethane conversion and 77% ethylene selectivity were reached over 5 wt% Cr/SBA-15 (Table 15, entries 15–17). A study of catalytic stability revealed good stability over 16 h TOS with loss of 12 points of ethylene yield.
(i) Bimetallic OMS-based catalysts for ethane ODH. In the recent decades, and as it was mentioned many times in this review, in the preparation of bimetallic and multi-metallic catalysts much attention was paid to achieve a uniformly and highly disperse metallic active phase by establishing strong metal/metal and metal/support interactions due to electronic effects, improving metal stability against physical migration, and to enhance the catalytic activity. Following these leads, recently the synergetic effect of the addition of a second metal oxide (Co, Ce, Zn, Nb, V, and Mo) to the Cr-MCM-41 sample, over the textural, physicochemical and catalytic properties, was investigated.1077 Accordingly MCM-41-supported bimetallic oxides containing Ce, Co, and Zn were prepared following one-pot synthesis, while samples containing Mo, V and Nb were prepared following a two steps synthesis (hydrothermal + impregnation). The mesoporous structure of MCM-41 and high BET surface area were maintained after the incorporation of both metal oxides. H2-TPR profiles showed different reduction peaks from those of the Cr-monometallic sample attributed to metal/metal interaction, and revealed an increase in the Cr6+ concentration for 4 wt% Cr–4 wt% Ce/MCM41 while higher temperature reduction peaks were registered for 4 wt% Cr–4 wt% Mo/MCM41 and 4 wt% Cr–4 wt% V/MCM-41 which could imply the worse reducibility of chromium. The catalytic activity of Cr-based catalysts is related to the amount of Cr6+ species and the characterization study indicated that incorporation of Ce or Co improved the reducibility of Cr6+ owing to the redox properties of CeO2 and Co3O4. Therefore, the catalytic activity could be correlated with amount of redox sites and dispersion of the metallic phase, and Cr–Ce/MCM-41 and Cr–Co/MCM-41 samples exhibited the higher catalytic activity while Cr–V/MCM-41 and Cr–Mo/MCM-41 displayed lower activity and selectivity to ethylene, and the highest ethylene selectivity and lower activity were reached over Cr–Zn/MCM-41 and Cr–Nb/MCM-41 (Table 15, entries 18–23). The highest catalytic performance was reached over 4 wt% Cr–4 wt% Ce/MCM-41 with 37.9% ethane conversion and 35.1% ethylene yield. In addition to medium catalytic results, the catalyst showed constant deactivation over 8 h TOS. The same group studied the impact of the addition of different TiO2 loadings over the catalytic and textural properties of 8 wt% Cr–Ti/MCM-41 samples.1078 MCM-41 samples were first modified with TiO2 addition prior to Cr loading. The synergetic effect between both metal allowed improving Cr dispersion, and Cr6+ concentration and enhancing metal–support interaction. TPR profiles registered two reduction peaks corresponding to the reduction of Cr6+ species dispersed on the α-Cr2O3 surfaces at low temperatures, and Cr6+ species interacting with the framework of siliceous support at higher temperatures. An optimum in the Cr6+ amount interacting with the support was observed for 1.9 wt% Ti, which exhibits high Cr dispersion, predicting optimized catalytic activity and stability. Therefore, the best catalytic results were reached over 8 wt% Cr–1.9 wt% Ti/MCM41 with 52% ethane conversion and 48% ethylene yield at 700 °C (Table 15, entries 24–27). Nevertheless, a constant decrease of the catalytic performance was observed over 8 h TOS (Table 15, entry 28). In the same way, a series of Cr/Ce-MCM-41 samples were prepared by first adding CeO2 and then Cr loading.1079 Moreover, the benefits of utilization of plasma energy for catalyst preparation (Cr/Ce-MCM-41(Si/Ce = 25)-p) over their morphological and catalytic features were observed. TEM analysis evidenced the alteration of the MCM-41 structure when excess of ceria was used leading to structure deterioration (Si/Ce > 25). The incorporation of ceria allowed enhancing the dispersion of Cr while the plasma treatment further improved the distribution and uniformity of nanoparticles in the narrow range of 7.4–22 nm. The authors claimed that the synergistic effect of ceria incorporation and plasma treatment strengthened the interaction between Cr/MCM-41 preventing the migration of Cr particles and controlling the size of Cr ensemble. Therefore, the best catalytic performance was achieved over Cr/Ce-MCM-41(Si/Ce = 25)-p with 62% ethylene yield and 64% ethane conversion, at 700 °C (Table 15, entries 29–32). A comparison of catalytic reported data is difficult because of the difference and lack of details of reaction conditions. Therefore, it is not possible to determine ethylene productivity. However, Cr/Ce-MCM-41(Si/Ce = 25)-p exhibited high catalytic performance and stability and offers great potential for the development of an industrial catalyst. A similar study was reported using SBA-15 as the support in which Cr–Ce/SBA-15 samples with different Ce loadings were prepared by co-impregnation.1069 The characterization study showed the improvement of Cr dispersion due to the incorporation of Ce with the preservation of the SBA-15 structure. The TPR profiles registered three reduction peaks, at 457 °C, corresponding to the reduction of Cr6+ species, and at 378 and 799 °C to the reduction of surface ceria oxide (Fig. 111). The comparison of H2-TPR profiles of 5Cr–Ce/SBA-15 and 10Ce/SBA-15 samples indicated that Ce reduction temperature decreased due to Ce/Cr interaction that modifies the redox ability of Ce species. H2 consumption increased with Ce loading to reach a maximum for 5Cr–10Ce/SBA-15 sample corresponding to the maximum amount of Cr6+ species. Therefore, the catalytic activity varied with Ce content, was optimum for 10 wt%, and good catalytic performance was displayed over 5 wt% Cr–10 wt% Ce/SBA-15, with 55% ethane conversion and 96% ethylene selectivity at 700 °C (Table 15, entries 33–36). The catalyst showed constant catalytic activity deactivation with TOS, registering a conversion decrease from 55% until 45% and could not be fully recovered after thermal treatment under CO2.

Years ago, the study and development of monolithic catalysts revealed several advantages of these composites, such as low-pressure drop, high heat and mass transfer rates and minimum axial dispersion owing to their unified structure in a single block. To take advantages of monolithic catalyst features, monolithic Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl catalysts were prepared using FeCrAl foils with honeycomb structure as the support and SBA-15/Al2O3 as the washcoat.1080 Then, different Cr content catalysts were prepared by impregnation. H2-TPR profiles depict two Cr6+ reduction peaks at 374–397 °C and 510 °C, corresponding to soluble Cr6+ species (isolated chromates on the surface) and to the grafted Cr6+ species on the silica surface, respectively. XPS spectra of Cr2p over fresh and used 5% Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl monolithic catalysts showed the presence of two Cr species, Cr3+ and Cr6+, with a higher Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio in the fresh catalyst than in the spent one. Catalytic data registered at 750 °C showed that ethylene yield increased with Cr loading up to 5% and further decreased accordingly with the Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio and the nature of chromium species (Table 15, entries 37–40). A stability test showed the high catalytic stability of 5 wt% Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl over a period of 1100 h TOS. Ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity remained practically constant along 1100 h and around 66% and 95%, respectively (Fig. 112). This work constitutes the best catalytic test reported for ethane ODH.

(b) V/OMS-based catalysts for ethane ODH. 
V-supported catalysts exhibited high activity and selectivity for ethane ODH,1081,1082 and the high vanadium dispersion, loading and support play a key role in the nature of vanadium species and activity. The most active species are monomeric V5+ while vanadate dimeric or oligomeric structures can coexist at higher V-loadings.1083 The nature of the support through the establishment of strong interactions could influence the metal dispersion and stability. As well as, basic supports favour the formation of stable vanadium mixed oxides, while acid supports contribute to high dispersion of vanadium species avoiding the formation of polymeric species. Therefore, a recent study reported the influence of the introduction of different metals into MCM-41 framework on the nature of vanadium species, activity and stability of ODH catalysts.1084 Thus a series of VOx/MCM-41, VOx/Mg-MCM-41, VOx/Mg–Al-MCM-41 and VOx/Mg–Zr-MCM-41 were prepared. The incorporation of different metals (Mg, Al, Zr) affected the catalytic activity, the structural and textural properties (crystallinity, particle size, dispersion) and acid/base properties. XRD patterns showed that the high surface area of MCM-41 enables high dispersion of vanadium and no peak of crystalline V2O5 was registered. The incorporation of Mg and Zr into the VOx/Mg–Zr-MCM-41 sample led to the formation of MgO and the tetragonal phase of zirconia. Moreover, the framework substitution of a larger diameter cation such as Zr4+ and Mg2+ by smaller Si4+ induced modifications of bond length of M–O–Si and then led to the MCM-41 structure deformation. FESEM and EDX analyses revealed improved V dispersion on the VOx/Mg–Zr-MCM-41 sample attributed to the surface acidity due to framework zirconia. The surface acidity determines alkane activation; greater the acidity, higher the ethane conversion. Thus the framework incorporation of Mg, Al and Zr produced different samples with different acid strengths and hence different catalytic behaviors. Accordingly, from NH3-TPD, the following order of acidity was obtained: VOx/MCM-41 < VOx/Mg-MCM-41 < VOx/Mg–Al-MCM-41 < VOx/Mg–Zr-MCM-41. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra allowed determining two types of vanadium oxo-species, one dimensional oligomeric and two-dimensional polymeric units in octahedral coordination. The best catalytic performance for ethane ODH was observed for the VOx/Mg–Zr-MCM-41, which contained only oligomeric tetrahedral vanadium species with higher dispersion and the higher amount of acid sites. Thus, at 700 °C, 55% ethane conversion and 43% ethylene yield with a productivity of 0.48 gC2H4 gcat−1 h−1 and good catalytic stability over 10 h TOS were reached over VOx/Mg–Zr-MCM-41 (Table 15, entries 41–44). Additionally, a mechanism based on catalytic, characterization studies and literature data was proposed following the Mars–Van Krevelen mechanism (Fig. 113).

7.3.4 Conclusions. 
Most of the reported catalysts for ethane ODH are CrOx-based, implying severe limitations due to the carcinogenicity of chromium species (Cr6+) and severe control and measures in the catalyst preparation, use and elimination. Therefore, alternative should be deeply considered. Besides, the catalytic performance of 5 wt% Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl over 1100 h reached goals of production and catalyst stability with good 63% ethylene yield, highlighting the potential of SBA-15 as a support. Actually, catalyst success will depend on catalyst and operation costs, catalyst stability and coke deposition besides the catalytic performances and features. The use of zeolites as a support due to the pore size characteristic is limited, since a high active metal content is required to achieve high catalytic activity provided by a large number of active sites, and to achieve high productivity, leading to a decrease in surface area and blockage of the zeolite pores. Therefore, the preparation of hierarchical zeolite-based ODH catalysts, due to their meso- and macroscale secondary porosity, together with the microporous primary structure and two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets based ODH catalysts, should allow the preparation of zeolitic catalysts with a high content of metal species with improved catalytic activity and mass transfer.

7.4 Propylene production by propane ODH. 
7.4.1 Introduction. 
Propylene is a valuable platform molecule for the production of a large number of chemical commodities (propylene oxide, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile, isopropanol, cumene, and butyraldehyde) and polymers. The propylene global production in 2020 was 108 Mt and is expected to reach 128 Mt by 2027, and the current industrial production is based on catalytic propane dehydrogenation.991,1085 From thermodynamic standpoints (Scheme 73), propane ODH with CO2 involves different competitive endothermic reactions and mainly propane dry reforming which is thermodynamically less constrained than ethane and methane dry reforming.1086 Other reactions such as cracking and propylene and propane decomposition take place readily. On the other hand, since propane ODH is a reaction with volume increase due to process stoichiometry, the co-feeding of inert gas is favourable to propane conversion enhancement, decreasing propylene production. Therefore, the challenge lies in developing a selective catalyst to promote propane ODH and kinetically suppress propane dry reforming. RWGS favours the equilibrium shifting whereas reverse Boudouard reaction improves catalyst life. In addition, efficient separation methods are required for CO2 and CO separation.1087
 Scheme 73  Thermodynamics of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 as a soft oxidant and simultaneous processes. 
Recent reviews deal with the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants such as CO2, NOx and S-containing compounds using solid catalysts.993,1002,1087 The extensive report carefully analyzed and described the impact of metal oxide nature (redox (CrOx, VOx) and non-redox (Ga2O3)), morphology and dispersion, support, addition of promoters and method of preparation. For propane ODH with CO2, CrOx-based catalysts revealed higher propylene selectivity at a higher propane conversion level than other metal oxide based catalysts playing key role redox cycles, CrOx species nature and dispersion, and the textural and chemical properties of the support.1002 The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant presents some benefits as it allows completing redox cycles, shifting equilibrium due to H2 removal by RWGS, improving catalyst life by coke elimination through reverse Boudouard reaction and enhancing propylene selectivity due to competitive adsorption with CO2 favouring propylene desorption. Still efforts are required to elucidate the reaction mechanism, to improve the stability and regeneration of the catalysts, and to design efficient, robust and selective catalysts towards C–H bond rather than C–C bond activation, using metallic oxide-based catalysts free of Cr due to its carcinogenicity. The acid/base properties constitute a crucial parameter not only because they affect the active metallic phase dispersion but also because different reactants with different adsorption properties are involved. Indeed, CO2 adsorption and activation are favoured onto basic sites while propane and H2 preferably adsorb on acidic sites, while undesired reaction such as cracking, isomerization and oligomerization can take place. Thus a balance in acidity and basicity surface should exist.
7.4.2 Zeolite-based catalysts for propane ODH. 
(a) Effect of surface acidity over catalytic properties for propane ODH. 
Cr/ZSM-5 catalyst with a high Si/Al ratio of 240 was first reported for propane dehydrogenation in 2011.1088 The catalytic study displayed the effect of the ZSM-5 crystallite size on the catalytic activity. Hence, laser Raman spectroscopy allowed determining the nature of Cr species, and CrVI species (monochromates) were shown to be responsible for the catalytic activity of the Cr-supported catalysts in alkane oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2. The best catalytic performance was reached over the 3 wt% Cr/ZSM-5-S with 0.4 μm crystal size than over 3 wt% Cr/ZSM-5-L with 2 μm crystal size due to the presence of a higher amount of CrVI species. Good catalytic data were registered over 3 wt% Cr/ZSM-5-S, with 48% propane conversion and 86% propylene selectivity, after 0.16 h TOS, at 550 °C (Table 16, entry 1). Surface acidity is a key parameter to selectively adsorb and activate the reactants, and different strategies can be followed to modify the acidity of zeolite by dealumination using acid treatment or by steaming at high temperature. Accordingly, a series of Cr/Si and Al-Beta samples were prepared with different Cr loadings by impregnation using AlBeta sample with Si/Al = 17 and dealuminated SiBeta with Si/Al = 1000.1089,1090 The catalytic behavior for propane ODH revealed the negative effect of the presence of Al over the catalytic activity of 2 wt% Cr/AlBeta achieving low 4.5% propane conversion and 2% propylene yield, at 550 °C, attributed to higher surface acidity. In contrast, good catalytic performance was registered for the dealuminated samples showing the benefit of dealumination over the catalytic properties. For the Cr/SiBeta catalyst series, an increase in the catalytic performance was noted with a Cr content of up to 2 wt% according to the number of Cr redox species and a further decrease. Indeed, quantitative results of H2-TPR determined that in the H2 volume consumption/Crtotalcontent ratio was maximum, with a drastic decrease for higher Cr content in the range of 2–7 wt%, suggesting that Cr is mainly present as non-redox Cr species in the form of Cr2O3 amorphous and crystalline as it was supported by UV-V diffuse reflectance spectroscopy spectra illustrating two peaks at 270 nm and 360 nm assigned to the charge transfer of Cr6+–O2− transition of monochromate species onto the support (Fig. 116). Maximum 87% propylene selectivity and 25% propane conversion were maintained over 6 h TOS at 450 °C (Table 16, entries 2–5).

Another strategy to modify and weaken the acidic properties of zeolite is the isomorphous substitution of Al by another metal such as boron. Therefore, Cr/silicalite-1 and Cr/H[B]MFI (incorporating boron) were prepared and further treated by steaming (Cr/H[B]MFI-st).1091 H2-TPR spectra revealed that no reduction peak of Cr6+ into Cr3+ was observed for Cr/silicalite-1 and Cr/H[B]MFI-st, while it was detected for the boron containing sample (Cr/H[B]MFI). The presence of boron allowed the formation of some Cr6+ species readily reduced into Cr3+ by H2 and also by steaming treatment. Then, steaming treatment enabled the auto-reduction of Cr6+ into Cr3+ located near to boron to counterbalance the negative charge of the framework. The comparison of the catalytic performance revealed that Cr/H[B]MFI exhibited higher catalytic activity and stability than Cr/silicalite-1. The propane conversion over Cr/H[B]MFI decreased rapidly from 50% to 20% in 2 h while this was around 10% over Cr/silicalite-1. When the catalytic performance of Cr/H[B]MFI-st and Cr/H[B]MFI samples was compared for 70 h TOS, a constant decrease of propane conversion from 30 to 7% was recorded over Cr/H[B]MFI over 60 h TOS, while ∼13% propane conversion remained stable over Cr/H[B]MFI-st. These results were attributed to the weakened Brønsted acidity because of steaming treatment and the differences in the nature of Cr species, the Cr3+/Cr6+ ratio and the formation of polychromates (Table 16, entries 6–8). Dealumination strategy by steaming of HZSM-5 zeolite to optimize acid properties of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 was also used to improve the catalytic performance of the Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst.1092 A NH3-TPD study showed only one desorption peak with a small area at 264 °C attributed to a low Al framework content for HZSM-5 zeolite, while after gallium oxide incorporation, a second peak at 465 °C was recorded, indicating that some strong acid sites are formed. After steaming and dealumination, acidity was drastically weakened. The excess of loss acidity was attributed to the loss of interaction of Ga2O3 with the support due to the absence of Al. Hence, the catalytic performance of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 samples varied with the Si/Al ratio, and propane conversion order was Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) ≫ Ga2O3/HZSM-5(650) > Ga2O3/HZSM-5(750) ∼ Ga2O3/HZSM-5(600) > Ga2O3/HZSM-5 ∼ Ga2O3/HZSM-5(800) ∼ Ga2O3/silicalite. Therefore, the catalytic performance was maximum over Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700), 22% propene yield, and remained stable over 100 h (Table 16, entries 12 and 13). Catalyst stability increased with increasing Si/Al ratio because coke deposition lowered. As previously published, the proposed mechanism for propane ODH over Ga2O3 supported catalysts should follow the heterolytic dissociation pathway, where the presence of Brønsted acid sites in zeolite should promote the dehydrogenation reaction (Fig. 117).1093 On the other hand the role of CO2 was explored, and a control of CO2 and CO concentration for propane ODH allowed determining that CO production was twice CO2 conversion, leading to assume that CO2 mainly participates in the Boudouard reaction and coke gasification.
 Fig. 117  Ethane ODH mechanism on gallium oxide supported catalysts adapted from ref. 1092 and 1093. 
The introduction of phosphoros into the zeolite by impregnation constitutes another strategy to modify the acid properties of zeolite because of the formation of weaker Brønsted acid sites in addition to thermal stability improvement.1094–1097 Thus, the same group prepared a series of Ga2O3/P-HZSM-5 samples with different P percentages (Ga2O3/P-HZSM-5(n)) and studied the catalytic performance for propane ODH.1098 The catalytic results revealed that phosphorus incorporation allowed improving the catalytic performance of pristine Ga2O3/HZSM-5, and the best catalytic performance was achieved over Ga2O3/P-HZSM-5(1.5) with 22% propane conversion and 19% propylene yield after stabilization (Table 16, entries 14–16). A constant catalytic performance decrease was observed over TOS to reach a steady state after 50 h. The propene yield first increased with P loading, until 1.5% and then decreased. This trend was attributed to the decrease of the amount of strong acid sites that favour side reactions and to the increase of the amount of weak acid sites which should play a minor role in the propane ODH process.
The influence of the Si/Al molar ratio for ZnO/HZSM-5 samples prepared from different Si/Al ratios in the synthesis gel using NaAlO2 as the Al source, confirmed that high amount of acid sites decreased the catalytic activity and stability due to side reactions.1099 Therefore an increase in catalyst stability with increasing the Si/Al ratio was observed and ascribed to the decrease in surface acidity supported by NH3-TPD and FT-IR of pyridine adsorption spectra. The role of CO2 was also studied by varying CO2 partial pressure, and confirming the benefits of the use of CO2 to convert H2 into water through RWGS reaction and thus promoting propane ODH, also fomenting coke gasification, while a higher partial pressure induced catalyst deactivation due to competitive adsorption of CO2 and propane over the catalytic surface. Therefore, the best catalytic performance was achieved over ZnO/HZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio = 160, with 41.5% propane conversion, 26% propylene yield and higher catalytic stability over 3 h TOS (Table 16, entries 9–11).
(b) Effect of the preparation method on the catalytic properties for propane ODH. 
3D-printing technology constitutes a new tool to prepare materials with tuned monolithic properties (surface area, channel size, chemical composition and loading) which is not possible by extrusion. 3D-printing has been successfully used to prepare adsorbent catalyst monoliths such as zeolites, aminosilicates, and MOFs.1100–1105 Following these leads, a series of Ga, V, and Zr H-ZSM-5 monolithic catalysts with high metal oxide contents were prepared by 3D printing technology (Fig. 118).1106 Characterization of the textural properties revealed that homogeneous distribution of metal oxides was reached for all samples and based on the H2-TPR results, V3+, V4+, V5+, Ga2+ and Zr4+ species were formed, demonstrating the variety of peaks assigned to the different oxidation states of vanadium and thus, the redox properties of the prepared samples. The NH3-TPD profiles of the 3D-printed catalyst monoliths revealed the presence of acid sites with different strengths accordingly to the presence of gallium oxide, vanadium oxide and also zirconium oxide while high-strength acid site formation due to ZrV2O7 superstructures was also detected. In summary, 15V–15Zr@ZSM-5 and 15Ga–15V@ZSM-5 had higher amounts of strong acid sites, while 15V–15Zr@ZSM-5 and 15Ga–15Zr@ZSM-5 had weaker acid sites. 15Ga–15V–15Zr@ZSM-5 contained low-, medium-, and high-strength acid in agreement with the mixture of three metal oxides. The best catalytic performance was obtained over 15 wt% V–15 wt% Zr@ZSM-5 with ∼38% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity remaining stable over 6 h TOS, at 550 °C, although all of the monoliths tested exhibited good catalytic performance and stability (Table 16, entries 17–20). These results demonstrated the applicability of 3D printing technology for preparing active propane ODH catalysts.

7.4.3 OMS-based catalysts for propane ODH. 
The dispersion and stability of metal species is key and determine the catalytic activity and can be influenced by the metal/support interaction, acid/base and textural properties. Thus, for the design and development of efficient and robust propane ODH catalysts, ordered mesoporous materials such as SBA-15 and MCM-41 constitute great candidates to deposit metal oxides despite their lower thermal stability in comparison to zeolites.
(a) V/OMS-based catalysts for propane ODH. 
As aforementioned, the preparation method and vanadia content allow controlling the nature of vanadia species while the carrier can play an important role. The surface VOx active species are present in sub-monolayer coverage with surface areas close to 300 m2 g−1 and containing 8 V atoms per nm2 for various supports, except for SiO2 because of lower metal/support interaction with 2.5 V atoms per nm2.1107 Recently, a series of V-MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis,1108 and low amounts of V species were introduced into the MCM-41 framework while conserving the high specific surface area and ordered mesoporous structure. High dispersion of V active species (monomeric and dimeric) was achieved; however, due to high vanadium content an increase in the number of acid sites, weak and strong was detected, as well as the formation of V2O5 crystallites. Laser Raman spectroscopy allowed stating the formation of bulk V2O5 at high V loading to which the decrease in catalytic activity for propane ODH was attributed. Owing to higher dispersion of VO43−, 6.8 wt% V-MCM-41 exhibited the best catalytic performance. An increase of the CO2/C3H8 ratio, from 1:1 up to 5:1, allowed improving propane conversion from 35 to 45%, whereas propene selectivity did not suffer a significant change. Thus, maximum 45% propane conversion and 92% propylene selectivity were reached at 600 °C with suitable CO2/C3H8 = 4:1 (Table 16, entries 21–23). A reaction mechanism was proposed involving as the first step, the H abstraction by O of the OV group from propane secondary C atom, and in the second step, H abstraction occurs by the O of the V–O–Si bond, yielding two hydroxyl groups whose dehydration produces water and the formation of oxygen vacancy, with propene being released. Along these two steps, vanadyl group is reduced from VV into VIII and finally re-oxidized by CO2, restoring VO group and oxygen lattice (Fig. 119). Good catalytic activity was reported but over a short 2 h TOS. A study of catalyst recycling revealed that the regeneration of the catalyst over 4 cycles was possible owing to oxidative treatment, the deactivation being due to the reduction V active sites and coke deposition.

(b) Cr/OMS-based catalysts for propane ODH. 
The catalytic activity and selectivity of supported chromia materials for alkane dehydrogenation have been studied for many years, with the dispersion and formation of monochromate active species being the key parameters. Years ago, it was demonstrated that the MCM-41 ordered mesoporous structure and its high surface area allow high dispersion and amount of Cr6+ active species achieving similar catalytic performance than Cr/SiO2 for propane ODH (Table 16, entries 24 and 25).1109 Previously, Cr/MCM-41 materials were successfully prepared by direct hydrothermal (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods without destroying the mesoporous structure of MCM-41 for Si/Cr ratio > 25. Difference in chromium species was observed, and for samples prepared by DHT (Cr/MCM-41(DHT)), monochromate species were formed while for samples prepared by the TIE method (Cr/MCM-41(TIE)), large amount of polychromate species were formed besides monochromate species.1110 Nevertheless, both samples exhibited similar catalytic performance with 92% propylene oxide selectivity and 28% and 29% propane conversion over 3 wt% Cr/MCM-41(DHT) and 3 wt% Cr/MCM-41(TIE) catalysts, respectively, at 550 °C (Table 16, entries 26 and 27). However, no stability data on catalytic activity were provided. Later, four series of Cr supported catalysts with different Cr contents (0.7–13.7 wt%) over MCM-41, amorphous silica and mesoporous silica with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal phase (SBA-15) were prepared by impregnation and tested for propane ODH.1111–1113 Higher dispersion of chromium species was achieved over mesoporous supports owing to their high surface area, implying a higher content of Cr6+ for mesoporous materials. The nature of chromium species varied with the Cr content, and Cr6+ species directly anchored are mainly formed at a low Cr content, whereas at a higher content Cr2O3 particles are produced. However, the amount of Cr6+ species depends on the support and specifically the surface area. For MCM-41 series, an optimum 6.8 wt% Cr content was determined reaching 40% propane conversion and 88.5% propylene selectivity at 550 °C (Table 16, entries 28–31).1113 Optimum Cr species dispersion was demonstrated as a crucial parameter to promote propane ODH and depended on the presence of Cr6+ species as precursors of Cr active species formed by a different redox cycles of Cr2+/Cr3+ in contrast to mainly described redox cycle of Cr3+/Cr6+.
In the same way, the catalytic behavior of Cr supported on silica, SBA-1 and SBA-15 with different Cr loadings was recently compared.1111,1112 Similar conclusions were reported, with the catalytic activity being dependent on the Cr6+ amount and dispersion in monolayer coverage controlled by Cr content and support surface area (Fig. 120). Moreover, Cr6+ species were determined as precursors of Cr3+ and Cr2+ active species for propane dehydrogenation and formed Cr2+/Cr3+ redox cycle earlier proposed.1113,1114 Moderate catalytic performance after 10 min TOS at 550 °C was obtained over 3.4 wt%/SBA-1 and 3.4 wt%/SBA-15, reaching 33 and 27% propane conversion, and 88 and 89% propylene selectivity, respectively (Table 16, entries 31 and 32).1112  Previously, the catalytic properties of the Cr/SBA-15 catalyst for propane ODH had already been described.1115 2 wt% Cr/SBA-15 exhibited better catalytic performance than other Cr-supported catalysts due to high Cr species dispersion, reaching low 24% propane conversion and 84% propylene selectivity, at 650 °C, over 6 h TOS (Table 16, entry 33). The preparation and use for propane ODH of monolithic V–Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl catalysts, using FeCrAl foils as the support and SBA-15/Al2O3 as the washcoat and V–Cr/SBA-15 as the active phase, was described with 10 wt% V and 0–12.5 wt% Cr contents.1116 The SBA-15 mesoporous structure was conserved after vanadium and chromium impregnation, and V5+ tetrahedral species were determined as the main active species, with high dispersion and enhanced redox properties, owing to strong V–Cr interaction. The incorporation of Cr allowed increasing the redox capacities of V and a lower temperature shift of the V reduction peak was observed from the TPR profiles. Optimum catalytic performance was reached over 10 wt% V–10 wt% Cr/SBA–15/Al2O3/FeCrAl sample, with good 43% propane conversion and 86% propylene selectivity at 650 °C (Table 16, entries 34–39).

7.4.4 Conclusions. 
Propane ODH with CO2 is an attractive approach to produce propylene showing different advantages such as shifting of equilibrium owing to combination with RWGS, completion of redox cycle with CO2 participation, and improvement of catalytic life due to coke elimination through reverse Boudouard reaction. However, many unknown data still remain to be clarified such as redox cycle and involved species, mechanisms, competitive adsorption between CO2, alkane and alkene and, above all, to investigate the stability, reuse and regeneration of catalysts in order to give industrial application a chance. Therefore, computational modeling and in situ spectroscopy studies will be fundamental tools for the rational design of efficient and stable ODH catalysts. Fig. 121 and 122 depict a graphical comparison of the different catalytic performance of propane ODH catalysts to evaluate the productivity or selectivity of the process. High catalytic data were reached, with high propane conversion up to 42%, and propylene selectivity up to 92% with rapid deactivation of the catalyst (V or Cr/MCM-41), while monolithic V–Cr/SBA-15 based catalysts exhibited the best catalytic performance. For industrial application, propylene productivity is a benchmark and propylene selectivity is of paramount importance. To compare the catalysts’ life additional studies are required since each process has a specific state-of-the-art technology, an optimized reactor system including catalyst regeneration cycles, and the reaction time can be short with catalyst regeneration intervals allowing continuous use for years.991 For example the CATOFIN® process, a widely applied technology, alternates incessantly dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge stages with a few minutes of duration for each stage, in a multiple reactor bed to ensure constant propylene production (Fig. 123).1117

7.5 Isobutene production by isobutane ODH. 
7.5.1 Introduction. 
Isobutene constitutes an important chemical building block in the production of polyisobutene, methyl tert-butyl ether, butyl rubber, and methyl acrylates. Currently, the two main methods to produce isobutene based on fossil source are naphtha steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, which cannot fully supply the increasing demand. Thus, catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane represents a potential and alternative route to produce isobutene.991,1119,1120 However, isobutane dehydrogenation raises limitations such as thermodynamic equilibrium, high-energy consumption, and severe catalyst deactivation. Over CrOx/Al2O3 commercial catalyst, at 560 °C, 55% isobutene conversion and up to 93.5% isobutene selectivity can be achieved.1121 As aforementioned, oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 is attractive because of its exothermic nature but limited selectivity is reached due to side reactions and deep oxidation of products. Therefore, oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2 becomes an attractive approach scarcely explored in the presence of zeolite and OMS based catalysts (Scheme 74).

7.5.2 OMS- and zeolite-based catalysts for isobutane ODH. 
As reviewed before, vanadium and chromium metal oxide supported materials are the most widely used and studied catalysts for alkanes oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2 despite their toxicity. In line, a series of Cr-supported silicalite-1 samples were prepared by impregnation, tested for isobutene ODH with CO2, and compared to the catalytic performance of Cr/SBA-15 sample.1115 A combination mechanism of simple isobutane dehydrogenation with the RWGS was proposed, following redox mechanism assisted by CO2 involving the Cr6+/Cr3+ redox cycle (Fig. 124). H2-TPR data revealed a higher Cr6+ amount over 3 wt% Cr/silicalite-1 than 3 wt% Cr/SBA-15 owing to better dispersion attributed to abundant nest silanol groups present in silicalite-1 zeolite. A comparison of catalytic performance 3 wt% Cr/Silicate-1 and 3 wt% Cr/SBA-15 revealed that higher isobutene conversion was achieved on 3 wt% Cr/Silicate-1 owing to higher amount of Cr active species, while higher selectivity was reached over 3 wt% Cr/SBA-15 attributed to the lower acidity of the SBA-15 sample. The characterization of spent catalysts showed that coke was more easily burnt off over 3 wt% Cr/Silicate-1 while a higher Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio was also determined indicating that Cr species interacting with nest silanols were more easily re-oxidized by CO2 during the ODH process. Moreover, the XRD pattern suggested the degradation of the SBA-15 ordered hexagonal structure. Thus, at 570 °C, maximum 36.5% isobutane conversion with 71% isobutene selectivity over 3 wt% Cr/silicalite-1 was reached (Table 17, entries 1–3).

Previously, a series of 3 wt% Cr/SBA-15 samples doped with different amounts of Ce (1–5 wt%) were prepared by impregnation and their catalytic behavior studied for isobutene ODH with CO2.1122 The benefits of the incorporation of a second metal have been demonstrated throughout this review owing to the establishment of new metal/metal and metal/support interactions improving active metal phase dispersion and stabilization. In line, the incorporation of ceria into the 3 wt% Cr/SBA sample allowed enhancing the Cr6+ species amount attributed to the improved Cr species dispersion owing to ceria incorporation. Thus, the maximum catalytic performance was registered over 3 wt% Cr–3 wt% Ce/SBA-15 sample, with 35.5% isobutane conversion and 90% isobutene selectivity at 570 °C, 10 min TOS (Table 17, entries 4–8). The highest activity of 3 wt% Cr–3 wt% Ce/SBA-15 catalyst was attributed to the highest reducibility of Cr species determined by H2-TPR. A study of regeneration and recycling by calcination in air, showed that over 3 wt% Cr–3 wt% Ce/SBA-15 sample, for the first run, isobutene conversion decreased from 35.5% to 22.5% after 4 h TOS and that the original activity could be almost fully restored by calcination and for four runs, owing to the removal of coke and reoxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ active species (Fig. 125).

The good catalytic performance of a series of VOx/SBA-15 with different V loadings (1–11 wt%) prepared by impregnation for isobutane ODH was also demonstrated.1123 The catalytic and characterization data revealed that catalytic activity was dependent on dispersion and the amount of vanadium species. NH3-TPD profiles displayed that acid site formation was due to vanadia incorporation, and that 7 wt% V/SBA-15 exhibited lower acidity than 7 wt% V/MCM-41. Maximum catalytic performance was achieved over 7 wt% V/SBA-15, reaching 41% isobutane conversion and 85% isobutene selectivity due to highest reducibility and amount of dispersed vanadium species determined by H2-TPR and Raman spectroscopy (Table 17, entries 9–11). Comparison of catalytic performance of 7 wt% V/SBA-15 and 7 wt% V/MCM-41 showed that lower selectivity was achieved over 7 wt% V/MCM-41 due to higher acidity, while lower conversion was attributed to lower amount of VOx active species. A study of catalyst recycle and regeneration, for four consecutive uses and for 4 h TOS, showed that catalytic performance was recovered after calcination owing to coke removal and Cr species oxidation.
7.5.3 Conclusions. 
Isobutane ODH with CO2 constitutes an attractive approach to produce isobutene showing different advantages compared to catalytic dehydrogenation. In comparison to propane ODH, fewer papers have been reported in the literature but the isobutene yield and selectivity are high. Moreover, as currently it occurs for catalytic dehydrogenation, the study and development of new catalysts and technologies suitable for propane ODH will be valid and applicable to isobutene ODH.


7.6 Conclusions. 
Alkane ODH with CO2 as soft oxidation is an interesting approach with many advantages compared to catalytic dehydrogenation or ODH with oxygen, promoting ODH directly or combining alkane dehydrogenation and RWGS with globally favoured thermodynamics and improved catalyst life owing to the reverse Boudouard reaction. However, many unknown data remain to be clarified such as the redox cycle and involved species, mechanism, competitive adsorption between CO2, alkane and alkene, and desorption of the product and specially the stability, reuse and regeneration of catalysts for commercialization. To achieve the required knowledge and understanding, computational modeling and in situ spectroscopy studies will be essential tools for the rational design of efficient and stable ODH catalysts. Good catalytic results were achieved in the presence of OMS-based catalysts that should stimulate and drive the scientific community and industry to explore their potential up to the last step of commercial application. Moreover, to overcome the limitation of microporosity of zeolites, the benefits of the development of catalysts based on hierarchical zeolites and two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets to promote physical isolation and protection of particles as well as mass transfer should be explored.

C Electro and photocatalytic conversion of CO2
The use of solar energy to convert CO2 into chemicals and fuels has received great attention in the last 30 years. Indeed, electro- and photo-reduction reactions have great potential for producing fuel molecules such as CO, CH4, HCOOH, HCHO, MeOH and EtOH, using solar energy directly or indirectly. In photocatalysis, also called artificial photosynthesis, electrons are produced from the excitons of semiconductor photocatalysts by means of photonic excitation, whereas in electrocatalysis, the electrons are produced from an external electric field that, in turn, can be produced by photovoltaic solar cells, i.e. indirectly using solar energy.
1 Electroreduction of CO2
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is a very attractive CO2 conversion method due to its ambient reaction conditions and simplicity of device fabrication. However, there are several challenges, such as low CO2 solubility, high CO2 activation energy, low energy efficiency and low selectivity of the process. But the main drawbacks such as the low stability of the electrodes and their deactivation in less than 100 h restrict their commercialization (metal poisoning and agglomeration of the active centers),1124 while the low selectivity of the process requires costly separation steps and energy consumption.1125 The low efficiency of solar to chemical energy conversion is due to the difficulties in fulfilling all the requirements: high catalytic activity at the electrode surface, sufficient passivation of the electrode surface (limiting the recombination of carriers), formation of a high energy barrier at the semiconductor/solution interface, and proximity of energy levels between the semiconductor and the reactants to minimize energy loss in interfacial reactions.
In the last few decades, the large number of investigations on electrocatalysts, reaction conditions and devices for CO2 electroreduction have allowed the development of the knowledge and the improvement of the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts. The current understanding of the reaction mechanism requires further exploration involving theoretical calculations and in situ characterization techniques to monitor the variations in the electronic structure of the active sites and to detect metastable intermediates. Therefore, research should not be limited to the development of excellent electrocatalysts, but to an overall understanding of the electrolysis system. So far, the design and development of electrocatalysts, due to multiple requirements and complexity to improve their efficiency and stability, have not considered the use of zeolite and OMS probably due to their intrinsic properties and capabilities to generate and transfer electrons (potential, faradaic efficiency, and energy efficiency), and it is reasonable to consider that future research will focus on other approaches.
2 Photoreduction of CO2

2.1 Fundamentals of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. 
Photoreduction of CO2 is a very attractive strategy for the conversion of carbon dioxide into fuels, making possible a circular economy (Fig. 126). Photoreduction of CO2 is not a selective process and several products are obtained simultaneously. The physicochemical properties of a photocatalyst are determinants for the development of an efficient process and for controlling the different stages of light absorption, charge separation and migration, adsorption of reactants (CO2 and H2O), activation and conversion (redox surface reactions) and desorption of the products (Fig. 127).

The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 requires high energy to break the CO bond and form the C–H bond, along with the participation of a high number of electrons (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or more electrons) to produce CO, HCOOH, CH4, HCHO, MeOH and others (Table 18). Then, the high redox potential for an electron transfer to CO2 is −1.9 eV due to the linear geometry of the CO2 molecule and the energy requirement to bend and inject an electron into its orbitals. Although the redox potential is lower than the conduction band (CB) of most semiconductors, some photocatalysts can adsorb CO2 and bend the configuration of the molecule. Thus, CO2 can have a lower LUMO level allowing electron transfer. To compare, the thermocatalytic reduction of CO2 requires elevated temperatures and pressures, while photocatalysis occurs at room temperature and ambient pressure under solar irradiation, and requires an efficient semiconductor. The photoreduction of CO2 constitutes a very attractive technology to produce fuel under atmospheric conditions and at least energy costs. Thereby, the photocatalytic properties of semiconductors have received much attention in recent decades. Among the main semiconductor photocatalysts used (MgO, Ga2O3, ZnO, CdS, GaP, SiC, WO3, Fe2O3, ZrO2),1126,1127 TiO2-based photocatalysts are preferred due to TiO2 availability, cheapness and their appropriate band-gap.1128 Moreover, these materials can be doped with metals such as Pt, Cu, Ag, Fe, Co, and Ni to limit charge recombination and favor the photocatalytic process.1129 Different strategies have been explored such as co-catalyst deposition, defect creation, increasing the specific surface area in order to increase the number of active sites to obtain an efficient photocatalyst with good charge separation, fast charge transfer, high absorption of the solar spectrum, low cost and high stability.1130

Upon irradiation, electrons from the valence band (VB) are excited to the conduction band (CB) leaving vacancies (“holes”) in the valence band. Therefore, the electrons and holes produced can be involved in a photocatalytic reaction (Fig. 127 and 128). The photoreduction requires a reductant and the normally preferred one is water owing to its richness, non-toxicity, and effectiveness. The main problem with the use of water as a hydrogen donor and hole quencher is that water competes to absorb electrons in the conduction band to generate hydrogen. In addition, this hydrogen is generally formed in higher yields than CO2 photoreduction products. Other reductants such as trimethylamine (amines) or Na2S capable of consuming the photogenerated holes during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 are also used, especially in the gas phase, conferring structural stability to the photocatalysts.1131

The reaction medium is another parameter that drastically affects the reaction pathway and selectivity of the photoreduction process. A gas phase reaction through rapid vapor phase deoxygenation leads to selectivity towards methane, while a liquid phase reaction through rapid dehydrogenation of water leads to HCOOH, HCOH and CH3OH (Fig. 128).1132
To date, the efficiency of photoreduction of CO2 has been less than 1%, and it has been estimated that an efficiency of 10% or higher is necessary for economic feasibility.1133 Accumulation and rigorous interpretation of results based on knowledge and trial/error is a way to the development of efficient photocatalysts but the development of fundamental knowledge is crucial. However, the lack of understanding of the factors that control product distribution requires systematic studies and understanding of the parameters driving this distribution, such as kinetics, thermodynamics, surface adsorption and activation of CO2, determination of active species that allow high reduction potential of photogenerated electrons and simultaneous electron and proton transfer. Undoubtedly, computational chemistry and the design of materials will be fundamental to progress in understanding material properties and reaction mechanisms.
A large variety of photocatalytic systems with or without a co-catalyst or Z-scheme component compositions for CO2 photoreduction have been explored. Nevertheless, only a few studies that focused on the development of zeolite- and OMS-based photocatalysts have been reported. A recent review summarized the recent developments and future prospects of the application of zeolite-based photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction.1134 Herein, the main advances and contributions of zeolite- and OMS-based photocatalysts for the photoreduction of CO2 to produce fuels are discussed. However, although it is a very attractive process due to its technological and experimental characteristics, the efficiency is too low even with the best photocatalyst to be considered for commercialization.


2.2 Photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2. 
2.2.1 Zeolite-based catalysts for the photoreduction of CO2. 
(a) TiO2/zeolite-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2. 
Zeolites are used as catalysts in numerous chemical processes due to their high specific surface area, pore structures, stability, Lewis and Brønsted acid and base properties, ability to host organic and metal complexes, nanoparticles and metal oxides, high CO2 uptake capacity1135 and ability to stabilize radical cations and trap electrons.1136,1137 All these properties can be tuned to obtain zeolites with superior CO2 adsorption and activation ability. Unfortunately, the application of zeolites as photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction has been rather disregarded probably because it was assumed that the “ideal zeolite” was a good insulator1138 so research has focused on the development of semiconductors for CO2 photoreduction. The photoactivity of zeolite is related to the possible photoexcitation of the (Mn+–O2−) to (M(n−1)+–O−)* pair. Thus, different approaches have been explored to introduce substituted or anchored heteroatoms into zeolite structures to enhance their photocatalytic properties. Moreover, zeolites provide oxygen defects that promote better charge separation while OH groups favor the proton and charge transport. These physicochemical properties of zeolites make them attractive supports for the design and synthesis of photocatalysts with different active centers specific for competitive adsorption/desorption of CO2, CO, H2O and CH4 and redox reactions.
Several semiconductor photocatalysts have been extensively studied for the photoreduction of CO2 such as ZnO, TiO2, Fe2O3, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and Cu2O. Among these, the adsorption, photoinduced activation and reduction of CO2 to CH4 have been extensively studied and demonstrated on TiO2 surfaces.1139 Therefore, several studies of zeolite-based photocatalysts have focused on the incorporation of TiO2 in either bulk form, highly dispersed nanoparticles, wall-embedded complexes or isomorphic substitutions (tetrahedrally coordinated).
A study of dispersion of TiO2 within Y zeolite cavities and frameworks, prepared following an ion-exchange method and hydrothermal synthesis (ex-Ti-oxide/Y-zeolite and Ti-oxide/Y-zeolites), showed the photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 with H2O to produce CH4 and CH3OH.1140 Characterization data indicated that TiO2 species were highly dispersed within the zeolite cavities and were present in tetrahedral coordination. The photocatalytic performance for the formation of CH4 and CH3OH indicated that selectivities strongly depend on the type of catalyst. Thus, over ex-Ti-oxide/Y-zeolite, high activity and selectivity to CH3OH was registered, while CH4 was the main product over bulk TiO2 and Ti-oxide/Y-zeolite (Table 19, entries 1 and 2). The changes in the photocatalytic performance were attributed to the higher TiO2 dispersion and charge transfer excited state of the highly dispersed titanium oxide in the ex-Ti-oxide/Y-zeolite sample.

In 2001, the photocatalytic activity of Ti-Beta zeolites in a hydroxide and fluoride medium for the reduction of CO2 was described.1141 The higher hydrophilicity of the sample synthesized in a hydroxide medium (Ti-Beta(OH)) allowed higher efficiency in the quenching of the photoluminescence in the presence of H2O. Ti-Beta(OH) exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than Ti-Beta(F) attributed to the higher concentration of photoexcited active sites, (Ti3+–O−)*, while higher CH3OH selectivity was reached over Ti-Beta(F) photocatalysts. These results revealed the key role of hydrophilic–hydrophobic properties that promote proton and charge transfer as well as the adsorption of water on the reactivity and selectivity for the photoreduction of CO2 (Table 19, entries 4–6).
(b) Organic semiconductor/zeolite-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2. 
Another approach to improve the photocatalytic properties of zeolite-based materials is the incorporation of organic semiconductors, such as polythiophene (PT). Then, the preparation of the photocatalyst Na-ZSM-5-PT by chemical oxidative polymerization of thiophene for reduction of CO2 to formic and acetic acid was described.1142 The advantage of a PT/zeolite photocatalyst is the absorption of the radiation at wavelengths ≤650 nm, invading the infrared region and enabling the use of a wider range of wavelengths for the photoreduction of CO2 (Table 19, entry 16). In line, an advanced photocatalyst was prepared combining the photocatalytic properties of TS-1 nanosheets were combined with those of a semiconductor (graphitic carbon nitride (CN)) to enhance light absorption, especially for visible light. Thus, TS-1 nanosheets were hybridized with hydroxylated CN nanosheets to form a 2D/2D hCN/TS-1 Z-scheme nanocomposite that exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than the pristine TS-1 nanosheets (Table 19, entries 6 and 7). The photocatalytic performance increased with the increasing loaded amounts of CN up to 10 wt%, to reach the maximum owing to optimum charge separation due to strengthened interfacial interactions favorable to charge transfer.
(c) Effect of the morphology over the activity of zeolite-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2. 
The microporous nature of zeolite can hinder mass transfer and hamper the catalytic reaction. To this end, the use of zeolite nanosheets with thicknesses of a few nanometers, the introduction of a hierarchical porous structure and the introduction of macropores for the design of novel zeolite-based photocatalysts would be valuable strategies for future developments. Accordingly, the preparation of two-dimensional (2D) TS-1 nanosheets was reported not only to take advantage of the larger surface area but also to reduce the charge transfer distance for CO2 photoreduction exhibiting higher photocatalytic performance for the reduction of CO2 than the 3D sample (Table 19, entry 8).1143 Following the same approach, the synthesis and photocatalytic performance of zeolite SAPO-5 nanosheets for the photoreduction of CO2 was reported.1144 The photocatalytic study revealed that SAPO-5 ultrathin nanosheets exhibited six times higher photocatalytic activity than SAPO-5 microrods for CH4 formation and higher than other standard zeolites. The results were attributed to the higher amount of exposed Al atoms owing to the morphology of nanosheets that enhances not only the CO2 adsorption capacity but also the excited state electron capture and transfer. In addition, the nanosheet morphology allowed the improvement of the mass transfer process. All these improved physicochemical properties enabled longer excited state lifetime on SAPO-5 nanosheets and led to higher photoactivity for the reduction of CO2 (Table 19, entries 14 and 15).
(d) Effect of metallic doping over the activity of zeolite-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2. 
As stated above, the possible photoexcitation of the (Mn+–O2−) to (M(n−1)+–O−)* pair is responsible for the photocatalytic activity of zeolites. Therefore, different strategies have been followed to introduce heteroatoms into zeolite structures and to enhance their photocatalytic activity. Hence, the introduction of efficient electron scavengers such as noble metals such as Au, Pd or Ag that are relatively inexpensive, allows improving the photocatalytic performance. Titanosilicate-1 (TS-1) is an important zeolite with isomorphic substitution of TiIV species in the MFI zeolite framework, which has long been applied to various photocatalytic and oxidation reactions.1145,1146 The photocatalytic activity of zeolitic titanosilicate has been explored in various studies, and the activity of Ti–O species was reported to be higher than that of Ti species octahedrally coordinated of bulk TiO2 nanoparticles for CO2 photoreduction.1134,1141,1146 Therefore, in addition to the benefits of the pore system, large surface area and the possible modifications of redox and acid/base properties with functional components, different strategies have been followed to improve the photocatalytic activity of these materials, such as the deposition of metal clusters and metal oxide clusters, metal nanoparticles and metal oxide nanoparticles and polymeric semiconductor nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of a high number of silanol groups confers high hydrophobicity to the surface of TS-1 that favors proton and charge transfer as well as adsorption of water.1147 The synthesis of Ag and TiO2 nanoparticles co-loaded zeolite TS-1 (Ag–TiO2/TS-1) by the ion-exchange and in situ photodeposition method in successive steps was recently reported for its use as photocatalyst for the reduction of CO2.1148 XPS and EPR analyses revealed that Ag–TiO2/TS-1 nanocomposite exhibits the higher amount of Ti3+ defects and oxygen vacancies, allowing better visible light adsorption and separation efficiency of the photogenerated charges. The high photocatalytic activity was attributed to the properties of TS-1, to the highly exposed reduction planes {101} of TiO2 and to the uniformly dispersed Ag nanoparticles. The TS-1 high surface area and rich defects enabled the high dispersion of active species and molecular adsorption of CO2, as well as accelerated charge separation by hole and electron trapping. Over 1Ag–16.9TiO2/TS-1, 3.16 for CO and 0.47 μmol g−1 h−1 high production rate for CO and CH4 under visible light irradiation, respectively, were reached and maintained along three cycles (Table 19, entry 7).
The photocatalytic activity of the ex-Ti-oxide/Y-zeolite catalyst was enhanced by the addition of Pt to promote the charge separation favoring CH4 over CH3OH formation (Table 19, entry 3).
Also, the photocatalytic performance of TS-1 nanosheet hybridized material with a semiconductor (graphitic carbon nitride (CN)), hCN/TS-1, was improved by the deposition of Ag nanoparticles. The hCN/TS-1 composite selectively decorated with Ag nanoparticles (Ag/hCN/TS-1) exhibited a high surface area and a 2D/2D heterojunction, improving the visible light absorption, charge separation and photocatalytic efficiency. The content (wt%) of CN and Ag was optimized and the 1.5Ag/hCN10/TS-1 composite displayed the best catalytic performance for CO2 photoreduction, and the yield in the presence of 1.5Ag/hCN10/TS-1 was approximately 7 times higher than that of pristine TS-1 (Table 19, entry 10). In this zeolite-based composite photocatalyst, the charge transfer was achieved under visible light irradiation (λ < 390 nm). The electrons photogenerated by TS-1 combined with the holes of CN allowed a prolonged excitation of the photoelectron lifetime, which was transferred to the Ag nanoparticles enabling a higher efficiency for the photoreduction of CO2.
The incorporation of other hetero-elements has been also reported.1149 The iron-containing zeolite HZSM-5 photocatalyst was used to prepare a Ti-HZSM-5 hybrid material by the sol–gel method. The characterization study revealed that Ti species were highly dispersed in a lower coordination state on the surface of HZSM-5 zeolite. The pristine HZSM-5 sample contains 0.03 wt% Fe which is tetrahedrally coordinated within the silica framework,1150 so the subsequent deposition of Ti species leads to the coexistence of Ti and Fe species on the surface of HZSM-5. Simultaneous photoexcitation under ultraviolet light allows the combination of two nearby excited states ((Fe2+–O−)* and (Ti3+–O−)*) that induce an increase of the excited electron concentration and an acceleration of the electron transfer rate over Ti-HZSM-5, as evidenced by the higher photocurrent response of the 0.99Ti-HZSM-5 sample, attributed to a higher efficiency of the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs (Table 19, entry 11).
The preparation of a series of FeOX/ZSM-5 composites with different Fe contents for the photoreduction of CO2 to CO and aldehyde was described.1151 The unique interaction between FeOX and the ZSM-5 support leads to a large dispersion of FeOX which generates an alternative way to separate and migrate charge carriers and avoid the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Consequently, the lifetime of charge carriers was prolonged. The photocatalytic results revealed that an increasing Fe content allowed reaching a maximum CO2 conversion rate corresponding to 3 wt% FeOX, with a further decrease. Therefore, over 3FeOX/ZSM-5 photocatalyst, a maximum 17.6 μmol g−1 h−1 high conversion rate of CO2 with a high aldehyde selectivity (43.1%) was reached (Table 19, entry 12).
In fact, the photocatalytic properties of zeolite have been associated with the presence of impurities in the sample such as Fe due to the presence of the (Fe3+–O2−)/(Fe2+–O−)* pair.1134,1152 Thereby, the photocatalytic activity of the commercial HZSM-5 zeolite for the photoreduction of CO2 with H2O at room temperature has been explored.1138 Under UV-light irradiation, Fe-O species act as excited (Fe2+–O−)* photoactive sites for the CO2 reduction reaction. The photocatalytic results revealed that the activity for CO production varied with the source of various zeolites. The highest 3.32 μmol g−1 h−1 CO production rate was achieved over the HZSM-5 sample CO2 (Table 19, entry 13).
2.2.2 Conclusion. 

Table 19 summarizes the main results obtained for CO2 photoreduction in the presence of zeolite-based photocatalysts. The productivity and fuel production cannot be compared exactly due to the variability in reaction conditions and reaction system configurations, but a general view can be given. The main drawbacks are the narrow absorption range of visible light together with low photoconversion efficiency, which limits the application of these photocatalytic systems. Compared to the study of semiconductor photocatalysts, the study of zeolite-based photocatalysts has been quite disregarded. The unique properties of microporous zeolites make them a viable photocatalytic alternative to sophisticated chemical and semiconductor processes. Their microstructures have a high surface area that favors a higher light uptake, a high CO2 adsorption capacity and physicochemical and adsorption/desorption properties that allow the activation of the molecules, providing them with a high reaction rate and photocatalytic activity. The synthesis and application of hierarchical zeolites to the development of photocatalysts should enable the enhancement of the unique properties of zeolites and counteract mass transport limitations. Hierarchical zeolites possess meso- and macroscale secondary porosity along with microporous primary structures. These materials then exhibit the conventional properties of zeolites with enhanced diffusion of molecules to solve the mass transport limitation. It is hoped that a combination of molecular simulation and machine learning techniques can be applied to the design of zeolite photocatalysts leading to an in-depth understanding of zeolite-based photocatalysts necessary for future research and development of the photoreduction of CO2.
2.2.3 OMS-based catalysts for the photoreduction of CO2. 
The photoconversion process involves three crucial steps: the light adsorption on the surface of the photocatalyst to produce electron–hole, the photogeneration carrier transport, and the oxidation–reduction reactions. The use of OMS based materials owing to their high surface area and their ability to support and host metallic nanoparticles and metal oxides, organometallic complexes and organic molecules to form specific active species allow improving the photocatalytic conversion of CO2 of the pristine materials.
(a) TiO2/OMS-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2. 
In 1998, the photocatalytic activity of titanium oxide species embedded within the framework of OMS Ti-MCM-41 and Ti-MCM-48 prepared by a hydrothermal synthesis was explored for the reduction of CO2 with H2O at 55 °C to produce CH4 and CH3OH in the gas phase.1153 The characterization study indicated that Ti species were highly dispersed within the zeolite framework and in tetrahedral coordination. The photocatalytic reaction rate and selectivity showed to be dependent on the type of catalyst. Over Ti-containing OMS and zeolite type catalysts, higher amount of CH3OH was produced while CH4 was the main product over bulk TiO2. These results were attributed to the charge transfer photoexcited state of the highly dispersed titanium oxide species (Ti3+–O−)* (Table 20, entry 1). The same trend was observed for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 over Ti-FSM-16. The CH3OH production was related to the local structure of the Ti-oxide species and the photocatalytic activity attributed to the charge transfer excited state dispersed tetrahedrally coordinated Ti-oxide species (Ti3+–O−)* (Table 20, entry 2).1154 More recently, the photoreduction of CO2 was studied in the presence of optimized Ti-mesoporous silica, Ti-SBA-15 and Ti-KIT-6, with different Si/Ti ratios.1155 Photocatalytic study revealed that Ti-KIT-6 calcined with Si/Ti = 100 exhibited the best photocatalytic performance for the reduction of CO2 with water in the gas phase which was attributed to the higher accessibility to the active sites together with the lower number of TiO2 agglomerates and higher number of isolated Ti species determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy, TEM and XPS analyses. The concentrations of OH groups were found to play a key role due to the competitive adsorption of CO2 and H2O on the catalyst surface that influences the process selectivity towards CH4 or CH3OH. The higher concentrations of the OH groups, detected from the FT-IR spectra for Ti-KIT-6-calcined with Si/Ti = 100, control the adsorption properties and the reaction pathway (Table 20, entry 3). Therefore, CH4 formation increased with H2O adsorption increasing due to the greater hydrophilicity of the material. An appropriate way to boost the activation of inert CO2 molecules is its adsorption on the surface of any semiconductor to lower its energy barrier.1156 Therefore, a mechanism starting with the CO2 and H2O adsorption on isolated tetrahedrally coordinated Ti4+ centers was proposed ((Fig. 129). The UV light absorption enables charge-transfer excited states (Ti3+–O−)* with the photogenerated electron and hole localized on neighboring atoms responsible for a higher lifetime of the excited Ti3+–O− (54 μs)1157 in comparison to bulk TiO2 powder (nanosecond order). The interaction of CO2 and H2O on the (Ti3+–O−)* photoexcited active sites leads to the formation of intermediates species and finally to C, H and OH radicals further combined to generate CH4, H2 and CH3OH. The source and intensity of the UV light and the H2O/CO2 ratios are the key factors influencing the photoactivity of the catalyst, the main drawback of this system being that the sunlight is not short enough.

(b) Addition of a co-catalyst to TiO2/OMS-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2. 
Different strategies have been developed to modify the acid/base properties of the photocatalyst surface in order to enhance the CO2 adsorption capacity, promote the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs (e−/h+) and to inhibit recombination such as the deposition or anchoring of organic and inorganic species.
(i) Effect of metallic doping over the photocatalytic activity for reduction of CO2. A series of TiO2/SBA-15 and Cu/TiO2/SBA-15 photocatalysts were synthesized by the sol–gel route and used for the photoreduction of CO2 to methanol.1158 The amount of TiO2 loading was shown to affect the crystallize size and the mesoporous structure of the catalyst, and an optimum loading of 45 wt% TiO2 with a crystalline size of ∼5.5 nm was determined. The addition of Cu as a co-catalyst to trap photogenerated electrons and inhibit recombination electron–hole pairs (e−/h+) allowed the enhancement of the catalytic activity. Therefore, over 2 wt% Cu/TiO2/SBA-15 catalysts, high photocatalytic activity was achieved with 627 μmol g−1 h−1 methanol productivity (Table 20, entry 4).
The effects of Cu-porphyrin (CuTPP) impregnation over the photocatalytic properties of Ti-MCM-48 materials for photoreduction of CO2 to CH3OH were recently explored.1159 The results showed that 85.88 μmol g−1 L−1 CH3OH productivity was reached over Ti-MCM 48 (Ti/Si = 25) owing to the presence of an excess of Ti3+ sites and mid-gap energy states enabling the transfer of photoexcited electrons from the Ti3+ sites selectively to the adsorbed CO2 molecules. Moreover, the impregnation of CuTPP (1.1 wt%) enhanced methanol yield up to 297 μmol g−1 L−1 (Table 20, entries 5 and 6). The photoluminescence study confirmed the charge quenching due to the electron transition from the CuTPP to Ti-MCM-48 material. The interaction between CuTPP and Ti sites of Ti-MCM-48 was responsible for the increase in the amount of Ti3+ sites due to the effective interfacial charge transfer. A mechanism for the charge separation/transportation in heterojunctions and photoreduction of CO2 to CH3OH over CuTPP/Ti-MCM-48 was proposed under visible light irradiation (Fig. 130).

The photoactivity and selectivity of the MgO/Ti-MCM-41 sample were also improved when the surface was decorated by Pt nanoparticles, reaching 8835 ppm g−1 h−1 CH4 productivity and 93% CH4 selectivity.1160 These results were attributed to the rapid transfer of photogenerated electrons from the molecular sieve to the cocatalyst (Pt) which favored the separation rate of the photogenerated electron and hole pairs and avoid their combination. When Pd was loaded, 94% CO selectivity was achieved (Table 20, entries 8 and 9).
(ii) Effect of alkaline and earth metallic doping over the photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO2. A study of the effects of the modifications of the surface acidity and active sites by impregnation with basic-earth metal oxides and noble metal nanoparticles of Ti-MCM-41 samples prepared with a different molar ratio of Si/Ti was developed for the reduction of CO2.1160 The modified Ti-MCM-41 samples were used as photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to CH4 and CO. Over Ti-MCM-41 (Si/Ti = 10), 93 ppm g−1 h−1 CH4 production and 29% CH4 selectivity were achieved, while the impregnation of MgO to Ti-MCM-41 increased the photoreduction activity by 1.5 times with 42% CH4 selectivity (Table 20, entry 7). A study of Ca doping of Ti-MCM-41 effects was previously described for the photoreduction of CO2 to CH4.1161 The Ca doping allowed the improvement of CO2 absorption and the reported catalytic performance of Ca/TixSiMCM-41 was superior to that of the Ca/TixSiO2 nano-sized material. CaO is able to trap and release electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and exhibits a high CO2 adsorption capacity, which improves the photoreduction of CO2. On the other hand, the photoexcited electrons in the CB can be efficiently accepted and transferred to the absorbed CO2 in CaO, so Ca/TixSiMCM-41 acts as an efficient reducing agent. Positive holes in CV can be trapped by OH or H2O species. These processes promote the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs (e−/h+), inhibit recombination and favor CO2 reduction. Nevertheless, an excess of Ti reduces the photoactivity probably due to the establishment of charge recombination centers within the semiconductor structure. Then, CH4 was produced over the Ca(10 wt%)/Ti35Si65MCM-41 catalyst at 82.0 μmol gcat−1 L−1 after 8 h TOS (Table 20, entry 10). These results showed that modifications of surface acidity and active sites allowed controlling the selectivity and efficiency of the CO2 reduction process.
(iii) Effect of amines doping over the photocatalytic activity for the reduction of CO2. The benefits of tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) impregnated on the Ti-MCM-41 sample over the photocatalytic activity were investigated for CO2 reduction to CH4. The photocatalytic results showed that the presence of TEPA allowed for the improvement in the adsorption and activation of CO2. For a 1% TEPA content, optimum dispersion of the amino group was obtained and 232 ppm g−1 h−1 CH4 productivity was reached (Fig. 131) (Table 20, entry 11). However, the high impregnation amount of TEPA caused the blockage of the channel hampered CO2 conversion.1162
 Fig. 131  Proposed photocatalytic mechanism for CO2 reduction TEPA/Ti-MCM-41. Reprinted with permission from ref. 1162. Copyright 2020, Springer Nature B.V. 
The photoreduction of CO2 was also studied in the liquid phase in the presence of monoethanolamine (MEA) over Ti-MCM-41 to produce methane.1163 Monoethanolamine was used for both reductant and adsorption properties towards CO2. The results indicated that this novel method opens the possibility of integrating the most mature CO2 capture process of MEA absorption and the CO2 photocatalytic reduction process into one process. Ti–MCM-41 exhibited higher photocatalytic performance than commercial TiO2, and over Ti–MCM-41, 62.42 μmol gcat−1 CH4 productivity was reached under UV light that limits the application of this process (Table 20, entry 12).
(c) Perovskite/OMS-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2. 
An MCM-41@CBB (Cs3Bi2Br9) composite has been prepared following a facile and effective impregnation method to confine Cs3Bi2Br9 nanoparticles (lead-free halide perovskite) using an MCM-41 molecular sieve.1164 This MCM-41 @CBB has exhibited good photocatalytic performance for the reduction of CO2 to CO under visible light irradiation with 17.24 μmol g−1 h−1. This result was attributed to the space-confined growth of CBB in MCM-41, which promotes the carrier lifetime meaningfully, which is favorable for electron–hole pair separation and subsequent transfer. Other composites were prepared using SBA-3, SBA-15 and MCM-48 as support. The photocatalytic study revealed that these photocatalysts exhibited activities 2.97–13.4 fold higher than that of pure CBB, with 25.4, 23.7 and 5.62 μmol g−1 h−1 CO productivities, over SBA-3@CBB, SBA-15@CBB and MCM-48@CBB, respectively. CO selectivity was close to 78% for CBB and almost 100% for molecular sieve photocatalysts@CBB (Table 20, entries 13–16). Moreover, these results are comparable with those reported for many lead halide perovskites, and among the best of the lead-free perovskites. This work demonstrated that the space-confined growth of CBB in molecular sieves constitutes an excellent strategy to improve the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance and stability of lead-free perovskite.
(d) CoO/OMS-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2. 
The benefits of CoO nanoparticles deposition on SBA-15 over the photocatalytic performance were explored.1165 High photocatalytic activity was observed for the reduction of CO2 to CO with 83% CO selectivity and a CO production rate of 25 626 μmol h−1 g−1. The results were attributed to enhanced dispersion and stability of the CoO NPs, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface, and absorption capacity of SBA-15 support (Table 20, entry 17).
2.2.4 Conclusion. 

Table 20 summarizes the main results obtained for CO2 photoreduction in the presence of OMS-based photocatalysts. The productivity and fuel performance cannot be compared exactly due to the change in reaction conditions and reactor configuration and catalyst preparation procedure, but a general view can be given. In general, the main drawbacks are the narrow absorption range of visible light together with low photoconversion efficiency (yield), which limits the application of these photocatalytic systems.
2.2.5 Conclusion. 
The main drawbacks of the photoreduction of CO2 to simple fuel molecules are the narrow absorption range of visible light together with low photoconversion efficiency, which limits the application of these photocatalytic systems. In comparison to the large number of studies reported for semiconductor photocatalysts, the study of zeolite-based photocatalysts has been quite disregarded. This fact has been attributed to the insulator property of zeolites. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic activity of zeolites associated with the possible photoexcitation of the (Mn+–O2−) to (M(n−1)+–O−)* pair and the key role of hydrophilic–hydrophobic properties governed by the presence of silanol groups to promote proton and charge transfer and water adsorption have been fully recognized and demonstrated. Moreover, the unique properties of zeolites and OMS make them viable photocatalytic alternatives to sophisticated chemical and semiconductor processes. Their porous structures have a high surface area that favors a higher light uptake, a high CO2 adsorption capacity and tunable physicochemical and adsorption/desorption properties that allow the activation of the molecules, providing them with a high reaction rate and photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the synthesis and application of hierarchical zeolites to the development of photocatalysts should enable the enhancement of the unique properties of zeolites and counteract mass transport limitations.
A combination of molecular simulation, machine learning techniques and in situ spectroscopy should help to determine the reaction mechanism and find the active sites that work to finally establish the structure–activity/selectivity relationship. This understanding is necessary for the rational design of zeolite and OMS-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2.

D Summary and perspectives
The use of CO2 as a C1 building block to mitigate CO2 emissions and at the same time produce sustainable chemicals or fuels is a challenging and promising alternative to meet the global demand for chemicals and energy. In this review, we have collected the different reactions involving zeolite and OMS-based catalysts to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels (Fig. 132). Their flexibility in the composition and structure such as support and/or a host of metals, metalorgano-complexes, and organo-catalysts and robustness were highlighted exhibiting the great potential of zeolite and OMS catalysts to boost CO2 chemical conversion. Today, the use of CO2 as a building block still requires a lot of effort, fundamental knowledge and insights to understand the mechanisms, determining the intermediate species and the active centres for each stage. The stability of CO2 and the high activation energy barrier to overcome thermodynamic equilibrium, requiring high energy consumption, are the main impediments and bottlenecks to commercialisation that keep these processes still in the laboratory research stage.
 Fig. 132  Scheme of CO2 conversion to valuable chemicals and fuels using zeolite- and OMS-based catalysts discussed in this review. 
From environmental standpoints, reactor design and energy efficiency are key and heat production must be based on renewable (wind, hydro and solar) or nuclear energy sources to minimize the carbon footprint and meet carbon neutrality. Moreover, the use of high temperature enhances the formation of undesirable products, making it crucial to design and develop efficient and selective catalysts. For CO2 conversion, heterogeneous catalysts are attractive and preferred for industrial implementation due to their catalytic features such as activity, robustness, efficiency, recovery and recycling, easy handling making them economically advantageous, environmentally friendly minimizing wastes. To enable CO2 conversion, efficient and high-throughput CO2 capture technologies with adequate purity, probably located at point sources, will first have to be available. In the same way, for the hydrogenation process, H2 will be available and green. Despite these barriers, CO2 constitutes an indisputable and necessary source of carbon to produce the chemicals and fuels that our society requires and on which it depends.
In the present review, we revise and examine the zeolite- and OMS-based materials activity and opportunities to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. We summarise the main advances, limitations and major challenges to be overcome in order to successfully convert anthropogenic CO2. The synthesis of cyclic carbonates by cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxides in the presence of advanced multifunctional catalysts based on zeolites and OMS has been extensively studied, and the main issues are low catalyst stability and few recycling opportunities, as well as the use of co-catalysts and harsh operating conditions that hinder the feasibility of this transformation. However, we can highlight the catalytic performance of zeolites and OMS containing the structure directing agent as active sites for catalyzing the cycloaddition with interesting opportunities for stability and recycling and limited catalyst cost. The cycloaddition constitutes an attractive and important approach because it involves a high-energy three-membered ring substrate, being a 100% atom economy reaction. Moreover, the use of CO2 constitutes a great opportunity to substitute toxic carbonylating agents such as phosgene and derivatives. Nevertheless, the inertness and stability of CO2 proved to be the major impediments. On one hand, marginal routes have been explored to produce cyclic carbonates such as olefin oxidative carboxylation and CO2 carbonylation of diols that received low consideration. On the other hand, the synthesis of dialkyl-carbonates is thermodynamically limited and received poor attention as it is the case of the preparation of acyclic carbamates or 2-oxazolidinones.
The synthesis of carboxylic acids such as acetic acid by reaction between CH4 and CO2, and propanoic acid by reaction between ethane and CO2 are practically impossible from an industrial perspective because of high energetic barriers. With respect to the synthesis of formic acid, the few references found in the bibliography evidence that CO2 hydrogenation using zeolite- and OMS-based catalysts has been insufficiently explored besides the requirement of novel and efficient catalytic system for the very challenging production of formic acid as a potential way to chemically store hydrogen.
The direct hydrogenation of CO2 in methanol to industrial production is still an immature process and still requires improvement of the catalytic performance in terms of activity, stability and MeOH selectivity. For future study, the adsorption properties (hydrophobicity) of the surface should be considered while exhaustive and comprehensive studies of active species and intermediates of reaction will be required for a successful ab initio design of an efficient and robust catalyst, taking into accounts thermodynamics since the reaction is feasible from low temperature. Considering the morphology, topology, thermal stability, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, acid/base and redox properties of zeolites and OMS materials, greater consideration should focus on these materials when designing new catalysts.
The direct transformation of CO2 into DME is an attractive route considering the environmental and economic issues involved. Nevertheless, the developed catalysts exhibited limited DME selectivity because of high CO production, in addition to the drastic deactivation catalyst due to water production. Nonetheless, the catalytic performance of La–Cu–ZnO–Al2O3/HZSM-5 and Cu–ZnO–Al2O3/HZSM-5 due to the good DME selectivity and productivity was highlighted. However, the direct transformation of CO2 into DME remained still an immature technology from an industrial perspective and studies taking into account catalyst stability and regeneration step should be performed.
Among CO2 hydrogenation reactions, CO2 methanation is the most favoured reaction from thermodynamics. The activation of CO2 is of paramount importance to reach high methanation activity at lower reaction temperatures constituting crucial parameters, the oxygen mobility and basic properties of the support, as well as the hydrophobicity of the catalytic surface to limit the water adsorption and inhibitory effect. Among the various zeolite-based and OMS-based catalysts herein reported, USY-based catalysts exhibited great potential owing to improved stability provided by post synthesis treatments. From commercial and industrial perspectives, several catalytic processes and reactors technology are available that should be transferred to CO2 methanation as high conversion and CH4 selectivity close to 100% are reached at the laboratory scale. However, the viability for large-scale CO2 fixation also depends on readily availability and price of CO2 and H2 issued from waste and/or renewable sources in order to develop sustainable processes, based on the heat produced from renewable or nuclear energy to move towards zero carbon footprint.
CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH is an attractive process to obtain new building block molecules and energy carriers. Although this process has been widely studied in the last decade, few studies focused on the development of catalysts based on zeolites or OMS besides the benefits of confinement effect, nanoparticle stabilization by electronic features and shape-selectivity (reactants, products, and transition states). The best yield has been achieved over the RhFeLi/TiO2 catalyst with 4.91% C2+OH, and maximum 100% ethanol selectivity on the organic product basis has been reached over the Cu@Na-Beta catalyst. The main challenge is to improve the yield and selectivity of C2+OH. To this end, the ab initio design of the catalysts, introducing the necessary active sites, rationalised and simulated by computational chemistry can be a decisive tool. Zeolites and OMS-based catalysts constitute good candidates for the development of selective and stable catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH, but they have been so far under-considered.
CO2 hydrogenation to gasoline, olefins and aromatics offers new opportunities to convert CO2 into value-added products and pave a path to CO2 circularity. In the last decade, significant advances in the development of tandem catalysts based on metal oxides and zeolites have been made for the selective hydrogenation of CO2 to lower olefins (C2–C4), gasoline (C5–C11) and aromatics (C6–C8) of wide interest to the chemical industry. The high activity of the heterogeneous catalyst is usually attributed to the synergy between the active sites and the support and/or the promoter. The improvement of process selectivity is still required and is challenging, and should avoid expensive separation steps. Thus, new studies on the specific modification of zeolite morphology, such as tuning the pore size and poisoning of external acid sites, should allow controlling the hydrocarbon product selectivity. Undoubtedly, the future tandem catalyst for direct hydrogenation of CO2 to C2+ will be based on zeolite-type materials.
The CO2 transformation into syngas constitutes a winning approach towards the sustainable production of chemicals and fuels towards a carbon neutral society. Further syngas conversion into MeOH or through the Fischer Tropsch process constitutes direct routes to the production of fuels and chemicals through technologies already explored, developed and implemented. Accordingly, the production of CO from RWGS is challenging because of its huge interest as a building block. Numerous studies investigated the RWGS process but new efforts are still required to determine the reaction mechanism and achieve comprehensive knowledge about the nature of active sites to finally establish structure–activity/selectivity relationship. In the present review, we recompiled a few studies revealing that the potential of zeolites and OMS materials has been scarcely considered and undervalued. These studies described important strategies to maximize CO selectivity and CO2 conversion, to enhance metal–support interaction and stability, to improve CO2 adsorption/activation and fast and easy CO desorption, which are determinants for the design of new RWGS catalysts. Future studies of catalytic stability and deactivation are also essential for RWGS development and implementation. Much effort has to be devoted to gain a greater knowledge and for understanding of RWGS, and a final push is needed to move from laboratory studies to the industrial scale, where zeolites and OMS based materials should play a more relevant role.
The catalytic conversion of DRM into syngas (H2 + CO) enables the simultaneous mitigation of two main greenhouse gases, CH4 and CO2, which is a 100% atom efficiency process, and provides a highly regarded H2/CO ratio of 1 for further industrial conversion. However, in practice, DRM requires high energy extra consumption due to endothermicity, inducing fast catalyst deactivation, which compromises its industrial implementation as an environmental-friendly method to date. Therefore, the design of a robust and efficient catalyst at “low temperature” is topical and very challenging. On the other hand, the viability of the technology depends on the capture and availability of both CO2 and CH4, which cannot be of a fossil source. The present review illustrates the high activity of Ni-based zeolites and OMS catalysts despite the deactivation due to Ni sintering and coke deposition that in turn may block access to the active sites and plug the reactor in long-term tests. The use of high surface area support and bi- or multi metal-doping constitutes the main strategies to enhance the metal–support interaction and match suitable acid–base and redox properties. Zeolites and OMS offered great opportunities for the design and development of robust and efficient DRM catalysts but the catalytic performance remained far from an industrial application. The studies require long-term stability test and catalytic regeneration step while the operating temperature is very high (>750 °C), with catalytic performance close to thermodynamic equilibrium. From a materials standpoint, the small pore size system of zeolites compared to mesoporous materials may be a weakness to reach a high dispersion of small metal nanoparticles and probably more prone to pore blockage. A large collection of references shows the potential of SBA-15 as support, which makes SBA-15 a great candidate for the development of DRM catalysts owing to the high surface area, confinement effect of mesoporous structure and thermal stability that should allow achieving high Ni nanoparticles dispersion and stability using optimum preparation method and suitable metallic promoters. Furthermore, the design of DRM reactors with alternating cycles of reaction and catalyst regeneration should be key. On the other hand, the combination of POM and DRM processes offers opportunities to overcome the main limitation of energetic cost by taking advantage of the POM exothermicity, although the POM + DRM route has been insufficiently explored and even less so in the presence of zeolite and OMS catalysts.
Another route based on renewable feedstock to produce syngas is the dry reforming (DR) of alcohols derived from bio-resources such as bio-ethanol and glycerol derived from biodiesel, effectively closing the carbon cycle by producing valuable chemicals and using the main greenhouse gas, mitigating the effects of anthropogenic CO2. Besides, dry reforming of ethanol and glycerol are emerging technologies that require knowledge and mechanistic insights to design efficient catalysts, reach sustainable syngas manufacturing, and solve the crisis of glycerol as a biodiesel byproduct. However, from the point of view of global syngas production and consumption and the urgency to mitigate CO2 emissions, the DRG would constitute an almost marginal alternative and DRE results a more promising and attractive approach.
As an alternative to catalytic dehydrogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as a soft oxidant emerged and strengthened due to several advantages from energetic, thermodynamic and kinetic (rate of reaction, higher alkene selectivity) standpoints, suppressing substrate and product over-oxidation, reducing carbon deposits and consuming CO2, the main greenhouse gas. Then, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes has been extensively investigated as an energy-saving and more environmentally friendly strategy to produce alkenes. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant for alkanes ODH involves several advantages to ensure and enhance the catalytic activity due to its ability to activate ODH directly promoting alkane ODH or by a combination of alkane dehydrogenation and RWGS, and thus favouring thermodynamics. In this review, the collected results for EB ODH revealed that high ST selectivity was reached at a good conversion level. Nevertheless, the lifetime of the catalysts has been insufficiently studied and future studies devote more efforts to studying the robustness of catalysts and reactor configurations to achieve and maintain high EB yield and selectivity over a long operating time, combining reaction and regeneration stages. SBA-15 exhibits great potential in contrast to zeolite that despite its better thermal stability and robustness and presents a limitation to efficiently and homogeneously disperse the high amount of metallic oxide due to the diffusion restrictions and the blockage of pores. Regarding ethane ODH, most of the catalysts are CrOx-based, implying severe limitations due to the carcinogenicity of chromium species and hazardous catalyst preparation, use and elimination. Besides, 5 wt% Cr/SBA-15/Al2O3/FeCrAl catalytic performance allowed reaching interesting goals of production and catalyst stability with a good 63% ethylene yield, over 1100 h highlighting the potential of SBA-15 as support. Actually, the catalyst success will depend on catalyst and operation costs, and catalyst stability besides the catalytic performances and features. Propane ODH with CO2 was also reviewed and good catalytic data were reached, although propane selectivity and productivity must be further improved.
The main drawbacks to the photoreduction of CO2 to simple fuel molecules are the narrow absorption range of visible light together with low photoconversion efficiency, which limits the application of these photocatalytic systems. The photocatalytic activity of zeolite associated with the possible photoexcitation of the (Mn+–O2−) to (M(n−1)+–O−)* pair as well as the key role of hydrophilic–hydrophobic properties governed by the presence of silanol groups to promote proton and charge transfer and water adsorption have been fully recognized and demonstrated. Moreover, the unique properties of zeolites and OMS make them viable photocatalytic alternatives to sophisticated chemical and semiconductor processes. Their adjustable porous structures have a high surface area that favors a higher light harvesting, a high CO2 adsorption capacity and tunable physicochemical and adsorption/desorption properties that allow the activation of the molecules, providing them with high reaction rate and photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the future synthesis and application of hierarchical zeolites to the development of photocatalysts should be a new breakthrough to improve mass transfer and ensure their development. Future research based on a combination of molecular simulation, machine learning techniques and in situ spectroscopy should help to determine the reaction mechanism and find the active sites that work to finally establish the structure–activity/selectivity relationship. This understanding is necessary for the rational design of zeolite- and OMS-based photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2.
In the present review, we have analyzed the current state of the art in the zeolite- and OMS-based materials activity and opportunities to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals essential for our daily lives and to pave the way towards reducing carbon footprint. The development of efficient and competitive CO2 capture and green H2 technologies are essential to moving towards CO2 conversion, while the potential of zeolite- and OMS-based materials should be part of the success. Hence, we hope that this review will be a useful contribution to the scientific community and will constitute a new stimulus for the use of zeolite and OMS based materials, and the development of new processes and technologies to boost the conversion of CO2 into chemicals and fuels.
