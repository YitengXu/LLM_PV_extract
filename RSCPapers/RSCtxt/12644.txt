To increase the energy absorption and thus promote the photocurrent, a novel parallel configuration of dye-sensitized solar cells is proposed and achieved in this work on the basis of double-sided anodic nanotubes. The parallel connection is verified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The parallel cells exhibit an average 70% increment in photocurrent and 30% enhancement in efficiency as compared to the single cells, due to significantly increased surface area and highly reduced series resistance. Theoretical calculation and experimental fitting results demonstrate that a tube length of ∼30 μm is optimal for the nanotubes used in this study with backside-illuminated architecture.

Broader context
To reduce electron scattering and increase energy absorption, anodic titania nanotube arrays have been vigorously investigated in an attempt to substitute the conventional nanoparticle photoanodes used in dye-sensitized solar cells. However, the use of nanotubes is not as efficient as that of nanoparticles, for example, the highest efficiencies are ∼7% vs. ∼11%. One of the most important factors is the low dye loading amount for light harvesting in the nanotube photoanodes, which, in turn, gives rise to a low photocurrent as well as a low conversion efficiency. In this study, a novel parallel configuration of dye-sensitized solar cells is achieved based on double-sided anodic nanotubes. This structure doubles the dye loading amount and promotes the photocurrent in a unit solar cell. The parallel cells exhibit an average 70% increase in photocurrent and 30% increment in efficiency in contrast to the single cells, as a consequence of a highly increased surface area and considerably reduced series resistance.

1. Introduction
In conventional titania nanoparticle based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1 the overall conversion efficiency is hindered by electron scattering (e.g., at nanoparticle connections, defects, impurities, etc.) and energy loss (i.e., in the red and near-infrared region). To solve these problems, diverse one-dimensional nanostructures have been studied, such as nanowires2 and nanotubes,3 which are found to accelerate electron transport and increase light scattering. In particular, highly oriented titania nanotube arrays prepared by electrochemical anodization have been vigorously investigated for controllable geometry (e.g., tube length,4–8pore diameter,9–11 wall thickness,12 intertube spacing,13 wall roughness,14etc.) in comparison to the template-assisted method.15
To date, dye-sensitized solar cells based on anodic nanotubes have two major configurations:16 frontside and backside illumination. In frontside illumination, nanotubes are produced on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO), and thereafter assembled into DSSCs.17 This normally requires a number of complicated steps before the nanotubes can be used in DSSCs, for example, sputtering a titanium thin film onto the TCO glass and then growing the nanotubes,18 or growing the nanotubes first on a titanium foil, peeling off these nanotubes, and transferring them onto the TCO glass.19,20 All of these procedures will substantially increase the costs of production, and therefore should be minimized. In backside illumination, nanotubes are directly grown on commercial titanium foils and assembled into DSSCs.21 Although this structure suffers energy loss via light reflection and electrolyte absorption, a comparable conversion efficiency was achieved with pristine nanotubes (no additional processing except for the necessary TiCl4 treatment) by Grimes' group, that is, 6.89%5 as compared to 6.86%18 in the frontside illumination. Very recently, an efficiency of 7.6% was reported by Li and co-workers when adopting the same configuration.22 This renders a great potential to produce efficient, while low cost, DSSCs based on the backside illumination. However, the reduced photocurrent due to energy loss has hindered its development. Accordingly, two methods are proposed to promote the photocurrent: reducing energy loss or increasing energy absorption. The former can be realized by using counter electrodes of high transmittance or cell spacers of small thickness.22 The latter can be achieved by additionally utilizing the back surface of a photoanode, as will be demonstrated in this study.
In the current work, a novel parallel configuration of dye-sensitized solar cells was proposed based on double-sided nanotube arrays, which drastically increased the energy absorption of the photoanodes and, as a result, the conversion rate. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements confirmed the parallel connection of the double-sided solar cells. The photovoltaic performance of the parallel cells exhibited an average 70% photocurrent increment and 30% efficiency enhancement as compared to that of the single cells, due to a significantly increased surface area and highly reduced series resistance. An optimal tube length for backside illumination was determined to be ∼30 μm, on the basis of theoretical calculation and experimental fitting results.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Parallel configuration and efficiency calculation
In the growth of double-sided nanotubes, a typical two-electrode anodizing method was used, where a titanium foil and platinum gauze were employed as the working electrode and counter electrode, respectively. In particular, both sides of the foil were exposed to the electrolyte. In this case, highly ordered nanotube arrays are grown simultaneously on both sides of the foil, as shown in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b–e reveal that no obvious differences in the inner and outer diameters are present between the nanotubes at the frontside and backside (hereafter nanotubes grown at the side facing to the counter electrode are referred to as “frontside” while those on the other side are referred to as “backside”). In our previous work,23 we reported that the tube length at the frontside was longer than that at the backside for short anodizing durations at room temperature. In this study, the tube lengths at both sides were tailored to be comparable after anodization at 25 V and 40 °C for 14 h, i.e., 11.1 ± 1.4 μm for the frontside and 11.2 ± 1.3 μm for the backside (based on 5 samples), as shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI†. This tube length has therefore been employed in the subsequent experiments, unless otherwise indicated.

(f) XRD patterns of the as-grown and annealed nanotubes at the frontside (F) and backside (B). A and T represent anatase and titanium phases, respectively. (g) A schematic diagram of a parallel configuration dye-sensitized solar cell with double-sided nanotube arrays. Cell components (from left to right): FTO-Pt/electrolyte/dye–nanotubes/Ti/nanotubes–dye/electrolyte/Pt-FTO. A dielectric mirror (M, Φ2′′, which is much larger than the active area of the solar cells) is used for light reflection. 
The as-grown amorphous nanotubes crystallized into almost 100% anatase structure when annealed in air at 450 °C for 3 h, as displayed in Fig. 1f. Titanium peaks from the underlayer of metal substrate are also detected. It is evident that the crystallographic structures are nearly the same for the tubes on both sides. The above results indicate that the highly oriented nanotubes at both sides exhibit no distinct differences before being assembled into DSSCs.

Fig. 1g illustrates a dye-sensitized solar cell of the parallel configuration proposed in this work. The double-sided nanotubes separated by a layer of titanium metal are sandwiched between two platinized counter electrodes, thus rendering a natural parallel cell structure after electrolyte injection. This configuration makes full use of both surfaces of a photoanode, therefore significantly increasing the dye loading amount of the photoanode, which is the determining factor of merit for the photocurrent. In application, the light source directly illuminates one side of the cell while a dielectric mirror is adopted to reflect the light onto the other side. In practice, this can easily be done (mirrors, or even lenses, are already used in concentrator solar cells to concentrate sunlight onto the photovoltaic cells24,25). Note that the reflected light spot is much larger than the active area of the solar cells. Although a reflection rate over 99% can be achieved in the range 400–850 nm (see Fig. S2 of the ESI†), the reflected light intensity is only 35 ± 5 mW cm−2 (measured by an Ophir Optronics power-meter Nova reader) in contrast to the 100 mW cm−2 obtained from direct illumination, because of an increased light pathway and tilted incident angle.
To determine the reflected light intensity exactly at the cell surface, the photovoltaic responses of the cells were tested against light intensities, as shown in Fig. 2. In general, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) increases linearly with light intensity in a typical dye-sensitized solar cell, where the transport kinetics of the redox couples in the electrolyte are fast enough to regenerate the dye molecules.26,27 This linearity is present in Fig. 2, especially at low intensity, but deviates when longer nanotubes are used and/or at higher intensity. After fitting the Jsc obtained by mirror reflection (empty symbols in Fig. 2) to the dashed lines, the reflected light intensity at the cell surface was determined to be 38 mW cm−2. This value is within the scope measured by the Nova reader and therefore adopted in the subsequent efficiency calculation.
 Fig. 2  The influence of light intensity on the short-circuit photocurrent density of solar cells with different tube lengths. The solid symbols were obtained by direct illumination while the empty symbols were obtained by mirror reflection. 
The photovoltaic conversion efficiency of a parallel cell is calculated using the following equation (1)where Pout is the power output, Pin is the power input, Pmax is the maximum or peak power output, Etot is the total incident irradiance, Ed is the incident irradiance by direct illumination (i.e., 100 mW cm−2), Er is the incident irradiance by mirror reflection (i.e., 38 mW cm−2), Isc is the short-circuit photocurrent, Voc is the open-circuit photovoltage, FF is the fill factor, Atot is the total active area, and Ad and Ar are the active areas at the side via direct illumination and mirror reflection, respectively.
In particular, the following relations stand in the current study Ar = Ad = A(2) Er = αEd(3)where α is a degradation factor of the incident irradiance via mirror reflection. Consequently, eqn (1) can be rewritten as (4)
It shows that eqn (4) can be used to calculate the conversion efficiency of a single cell when α = 0 and that of a parallel cell when α = 0.38 in this study. Note that the method used herein to determine the Jsc of a photovoltaic cell remains the same for both single and parallel structures, i.e., dividing the Isc with A, on the basis of eqn (4).
2.2 Verification of parallel connection
The typical performances of one parallel solar cell under different illumination modes are compared in Fig. 3a. In one case, the photovoltaic behavior of a single cell (i.e., the cell at each side) was tested separately: “Single-F” and “Single-B” represent solar cells assembled with the nanotubes at the frontside and backside, respectively. In the other case, the performance of a parallel cell (i.e., the cells at both sides) was tested: “Parallel-FB” means directly illuminating the F while reflecting on the B, and “Parallel-BF” denotes directly illuminating the B while reflecting on the F. The cell performance of Single-B is superior to that of the Single-F. The relatively higher Jsc may originate from the longer nanotubes on B, considering the standard deviation of the tube length (see Section 2.1). The larger Voc is ascribed to the longer electron lifetime in the nanotubes at the backside. The respective electron lifetimes are determined to be 43 ms, 31 ms and 31 ms for Single-B, Single-F, and Parallel cells in the dark, based on the peak frequencies in Fig. 3b from τn = 1/ωmin = 1/2πfmin.28,29 The photovoltaic behaviors of Parallel-BF and Parallel-FB are nearly the same, except for a little higher Jsc for the Parallel-BF. This is understandable in light of the possible longer nanotubes at the backside. Interestingly, the Voc of both parallel cases are comparable with that of the Single-F. Taking into account the similar electron lifetimes in the Parallel and Single-F cells, it suggests that the lifetime in a parallel structure is limited by that of the shorter one of the individual single cells.

Electrochemical impedance spectra of the cell (a) measured under a −0.75 V applied bias in the dark: (b) Bode phase plots, (c) Nyquist plots. Inset is a local magnification. The lines in (b) and (c) show the fitted results (χ2 < 0.01). 
In Fig. 3c, Nyquist plots of the pertinent cells are presented. In general, three semicircles appear in a typical Nyquist diagram of DSSCs, which are associated with (in the order of decreasing frequency) charge transfer at the counter electrode, electron transport in the photoanode and charge transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, and Nernst diffusion within the electrolyte.28,30 Accordingly, the following parameters are obtained by fitting the equivalent circuit illustrated in Fig. S3 of the ESI†: internal ohmic resistance (Rh), charge transfer impedance at the electrolyte/Pt-FTO interface (Rp), and recombination (or dark reaction) impedance (Rr) at the nanotubes/electrolyte interface, as listed in Table 1. The Rh, mainly related to the sheet resistance of FTO and titanium foil, is determined by the first intercept of the semicircles (frequency > 105 Hz).31,32 The Rp and Rr are attained from the diameters of the small and large semicircles, respectively.29,32 All of the measured values of the three parameters satisfy the following relationship (5)

Here RSingle-F, RSingle-B, and RParallel are the impedance of the Single-F, Single-B, and Parallel cells, respectively. The calculated values of RParallel, using eqn (5), are also given in Table 1, which are in good agreement with the measurements. This directly discloses the parallel connection of the double-sided solar cells.
2.3 Photovoltaic characteristics of parallel solar cells

Table 1 indicates that the parallel structure merits the photovoltaic performance by substantially reducing the series resistance (Rs) of the solar cell, as the Rh and Rp are assigned to be the components of Rs.31 In view of this, to reduce the Rh and therefore the Rs, the same double-sided nanotubes were grown on titanium foils of 0.127 mm instead of the normal 0.250 mm. Moreover, UV–ozone treatment was applied to the nanotubes before dye loading, which is believed to benefit the cells by reducing the surface states in the nanotubes, according to the results of Zhang and co-workers.33 The photovoltaic behavior of the cells on 0.127 mm foils surpasses that on 0.250 mm foils, as shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI†. Remarkably, the following relation is obtained as expected Rs, 0.250 mm Single > Rs, 0.127 mm Single > Rs, 0.250 mm Parallel > Rs, 0.127 mm Parallel(6)where the subscripts correspond to the labels in Fig. S4†. This further demonstrates that the parallel configuration contributes to cell performance by decreasing the series resistance. This, in turn, increases the photocurrent in a parallel system, as revealed in Fig. 4. By simply adding the photocurrent at the frontside under 1 sun illumination (i.e., Curve III) and that at the backside under mirror reflection (i.e., Curve I), the photocurrent of a parallel cell is calculated to be the same as Curve (I + III), which is smaller than the measured value (i.e., Curve IV) over the whole testing range. This deviation in photocurrent results from the reduced series resistance in the parallel configuration. In addition, the cell exhibits serious nonlinearity (i.e., conversion efficiency: 3.37% under 0.38 sun vs. 1.72% under 1 sun, for Curve I vs. Curve II) due to the increased tube length, in line with the measurements in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 4  The photovoltaic performance (solid lines) of a parallel dye-sensitized solar cell under mirror reflection (or 0.38 sun) at the backside only (I), 1 sun illumination at the backside only (II), 1 sun illumination at the frontside only (III), 1 sun illumination at the frontside and mirror reflection (or 0.38 sun) at the backside (IV). The (I + III) curve is a calculation (dashed line) from adding the photocurrents of I and III together. The lengths of the nanotubes used are 39.1 μm at the frontside (F) and 27.5 μm at the backside (B). 
As such, the photocurrent of a parallel solar cell benefits from three contributions: the cell at the frontside, the cell at the backside, and the interaction between the two individual cells, which reduces the series resistance through the parallel connection as in Fig. 4. In contrast, the photocurrent of a single cell depends on one cell only. Consequently, the parallel configuration substantially promotes the photocurrent in a unit solar cell through two routes: additionally utilizing the back surface, and considerably reducing the series resistance.
The photovoltaic characteristics of DSSCs with nanotubes under TiCl4 treatment for different durations are summarized in Table 2. In all cases, the parallel cells exhibit superior performance over the single cells. Considerable improvements in the photocurrent and series resistance are obtained, consistent with the above discussion. In principle, the dye loading amount of the photoanode in a parallel cell is two times larger than that in a single cell, provided that the tube lengths at both sides are comparable, and hence will give rise to at least a 100% increase in photocurrent. However, on average only a 70% increment is achieved (based on more than 30 cells). This is attributed to the lower incident intensity at the backside via light reflection (i.e., 38 mW cm−2), which produces less electrons in comparison to direct illumination (i.e., 100 mW cm−2). The fill factor of the cells increases slightly, due to greatly reduced Rs in the parallel configuration, as shown in Table 2: Rs is more than halved compared to in the single cells. A comparable Voc is obtained in both structures, as the electron lifetime in the parallel system is limited by that of the shorter one of the individual single cells. At the given conditions, an average efficiency enhancement of 30% (based on more than 30 cells) is achieved in the parallel cells. In addition, the cell performance increases with the duration of TiCl4 treatment, which may originate from the increased surface area as more tiny nanoparticles form on the tube surface.

2.4 Optimal tube length for parallel solar cells
The photocurrent of a dye-sensitized solar cell is closely related to the dye loading amount of the photoanode which, in turn, is significantly affected by length of the nanotubes. Fig. 5a shows that the photovoltaic properties of the single cells increase with the length of the nanotubes up to 25.5 μm and decline when longer tubes are used. A similar trend is also present in parallel cells, as shown in Fig. 5b. An efficient cell exhibits a conversion efficiency of 2.57% for a single structure and 3.38% for a parallel configuration, an efficiency enhancement of over 30%. Obviously, the cell performance strongly depends on the photocurrent.
 Fig. 5  The effect of nanotube length on photovoltaic properties of single cells (a) and parallel cells (b). The parallel cells are tested with nanotubes at the frontside (F) under 1 sun illumination and that at the backside (B) under mirror reflection (or 0.38 sun). 
In general, the longer the tubes, the more the dye loading amount and thus the greater the photocurrent. However, the electron diffusion length in the tubes, on the other hand, limits the length to an optimal value. This optimal length is particularly significant for dye-sensitized solar cells with a backside-illuminated configuration. In this structure, photon energy is first absorbed at the tube tops, where electron injection takes place predominantly. Thereafter, the injected electrons have to percolate all the way though the tubes to the collecting electrode. In this scenario, the charge collecting efficiency of the cell decreases seriously when the tube length exceeds the electron diffusion length, since the majority of the electrons generated at the tube tops can no longer be collected. As such, it is important to determine the optimal tube length in backside-illuminated solar cells for a higher photocurrent.
Let us consider solar cells with a single structure first. In principle, the short-circuit photocurrent density of a dye-sensitized solar cell under backside illumination can be expressed as Jsc = ∫qF(λ)[1 − r(λ) − a(λ)]IPCE(λ)dλ(7)where q is the electron elementary charge, F(λ) is the incident photon flux density, r(λ) is the energy loss due to reflection by the counter electrode, a(λ) is the energy loss owing to absorption by the counter electrode and electrolyte, and IPCE(λ) is the incident photon to current efficiency. Accordingly, the photon flux density incident on the nanotubes is as follows f(λ) = F(λ)[1 − r(λ) − a(λ)](8)
The IPCE(λ) is a product of the light harvesting efficiency LHE(λ), the quantum yield of charge injection ϕinj, and the charge collecting efficiency ηcc27 IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ)ϕinjηcc(9)
The LHE(λ) is used to measure the absorption of incident photon energy by available dye molecules, and given by27 LHE(λ) = 1 − 10−Γσ(λ)(10)
Here, Γ is the dye loading amount per square centimetre of projected surface area of the photoanode and σ is the absorption cross section of the dye molecules at the wavelength λ.
To obtain a relation between the Jsc and the nanotube length L and hence determine the optimal tube length, the following assumptions are used to derive the light harvesting efficiency in terms of L instead of λ: (1) dye molecules are adsorbed uniformly on both inner and outer surfaces of a tube, as illustrated in Fig. 6a; (2) the global dye loading amount is the sum of n layers of dye molecules along the tubes, with the thickness of each layer being the dimension (l) of a dye molecule, i.e., L = nl; (3) each layer absorbs the same portion (α) of the incident photon energy. As such, the light harvesting efficiency can be calculated as (11)
 Fig. 6  Models used to calculate the light harvesting efficiency of the solar cells under backside illumination with nanotube lengths (a) L ≤ L0, and (b) L > L0. The inset illustrates the magnification of a tube with dye molecules (red dots) attached on both inner and outer surfaces. 
Here, the numerator is the total absorption of the incident photon energy by n layers of dye molecules, while the denominator is the incident photon flux density as in eqn (8). As a consequence, LHE(n) = 1 − (1 − α)n(12)
Apparently the light harvesting efficiency will be close to unity when there are infinite layers of dye molecules. With the above equations, eqn (7) can be written as Jsc = ∫qf(λ)LHE(n)ϕinjηccdλ = LHE(n)ϕinjηcc∫qf(λ)dλ = [1 − (1 − α)n]ηccC(13)where C = ϕinj∫qf(λ)dλ(14)
As photons absorbed by dye molecules are efficiently converted to conduction band electrons, e.g., ϕinj > 99.9% under certain conditions,27 the value of C is approximately constant for a single or parallel configuration in this study, which depends on the electrolyte category, spacer thickness, counter electrode, and incident photon flux density.
In the case of the nanotube length being shorter than electron diffusion length (L0) within the tubes, as shown in Fig. 6a, ηcc = 1(L ≤ L0)(15)
Therefore, Jsc = C[1 − (1 − α)L/l](L ≤ L0)(16)With the tube length being longer than L0, as illustrated in Fig. 6b, electrons injected at the part beyond L0 cannot be collected any more. Assuming this part contains m layers (L − L0 = ml) of dye molecules, the total energy loss (Eloss) is presented as Eloss = αf(λ) + α(1 − α)f(λ) + α(1 − α)2f(λ) + ... + α(1 − α)m−1f(λ)(17)
The total energy absorption is Eabs = αf(λ) + α(1 − α)f(λ) + α(1 − α)2f(λ) + ... + α(1 − α)n−1f(λ)(18)
Accordingly, the charge collecting efficiency is determined to be (19)
Thus, Jsc = C(1 − α)L/l[(1 − α)−L0/l − 1] (L > L0)(20)
Using l = 0.0015 μm (or 1.5 nm)26 and fitting eqns (16) and (20) with the data given in Fig. 5a, the short-circuit photocurrent density for a single cell is determined as (21)with α = 4.36 × 10−5 and L0 = 30.03 μm, as displayed in Fig. 7. It indicates that, under backside illumination, the optimal tube length is around 30 μm for the nanotubes used in the current study, in line with our previous estimation.34 Obviously, the photocurrent decreases drastically once the tube length exceeds the electron diffusion length.
 Fig. 7  Plots of short-circuit photocurrent density vs.nanotube length. Data (□ single cells, Δ parallel cells) are from Fig. 5. The curves are fitted based on the calculation in the text, with solid lines for a single structure and dashed lines for a parallel configuration. 
Now let us consider the parallel configuration. In the parallel configuration, the photocurrent from the cell under direct illumination (Jsc-d) follows eqn (21), while that from the cell under mirror reflection (Jsc-r) differs as a result of relatively smaller incident photon flux density. This gives rise to a smaller value (referred to as C′) of eqn (14)via mirror reflection. As the electron diffusion length is expected to be independent of light intensity,35 it is assumed that electron diffusion length under mirror reflection is the same as that under direct illumination, that is, L0 = 30.03 μm. Therefore, the short-circuit current density of a parallel cell is computed as Jsc = Jsc-d + Jsc-r = 11.5 × (1 − 0.97L) + C′ηcc[1 − (1 − α)L/l](L ≤ L0)(22) Jsc = Jsc-d + Jsc-r = 17.3 × 0.97L + C′ηcc[1 − (1 − α)L/l](L > L0)(23)
By fitting eqns (22) and (23) with the data given in Fig. 5b, the Jsc for a parallel cell is determined to be (24)
The relevant fitting curves are shown in Fig. 7.
The above results demonstrate that the photocurrent of a dye-sensitized solar cell under backside illumination is significantly affected by the tube length, with an optimal length being ∼30 μm in this study. Within this length, the photocurrent is promoted with the parallel configuration, as shown in Fig. 7, due to additional utilization of the back surface or an increment in energy absorption. Eqns (21) and (24) reveal that the constant C also plays an important part in promoting the photocurrent, which is closely associated with the photon energy incident on the nanotubes. To enlarge C, and hence increase the photocurrent, it is effective to decrease the energy loss at the counter electrode and that in the electrolyte.
3. Conclusions
In conclusion, a novel parallel configuration of dye-sensitized solar cells is achieved in this study based on double-sided anodic titania nanotube arrays. The parallel connection is verified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The photovoltaic performance of the parallel cells exhibits an average 70% increment in photocurrent and 30% enhancement in conversion efficiency, benefiting from the additional utilization of the back surface and considerable reduction of the series resistance. A theoretical calculation and relevant fitting results indicate that a tube length of ∼30 μm is optimal for the nanotubes used in the current work.
4. Experimental section
A Keithley 2400 SourceMeter was used as the power supply in the anodic growth of titania nanotube arrays. Prior to anodization, titanium foils (99.7% purity, Sigma-Aldrich) with a thickness of 0.250 mm, unless otherwise indicated, were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol, and deionized (DI) water for 10 min each. All of the experiments were carried out in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol (anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) with 0.3 wt% ammonium fluoride (98+ %, ACS reagent, Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 vol.% DI water at 25 V and 40 °C. The temperature was controlled with a water bath. The resultant nanotubes were ultrasonically cleaned in DI water for 20 min after anodization, dried in air, and annealed in air at 450 °C for 3 h with heating and cooling rates of 5 °C min−1. The annealed samples were treated in 40 mM aqueous solutions of TiCl4 at 70 °C for different durations. The TiCl4 solution prepared under ice-cooled conditions was loaded into a closed vessel with one sample in partial vacuum each time. Again, the obtained samples were annealed under the same conditions but for 30 min only. For UV–ozone treatment, the samples were treated under a UV surface decontamination system (PSD-UV, Novascan) for 20 min.
Samples were sensitized with 0.3 mM N719 dye (cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium), Solaronix) in acetonitrile/tert-butanol (1:1 v/v) solvent for 24 h. The dye loading process was performed in a partial vacuum. Transparent platinized counter electrodes were prepared by drop spreading a 0.6 M H2PtCl6/isopropanol solution on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 15 Ω sq−1) glass substrate, and followed by thermal decomposition at 400 °C for 15 min. For cell assembly, two counter electrodes were placed at each side of a sample. A hot molten spacer (SX1170, Solaronix, 60 μm) was sandwiched between the sample and the counter electrode. The electrolyte solution (EL HPE, Dyesol) containing an iodide/tri-iodide redox couple was introduced into the cells from one hole at the frontside (under partial vacuum) and two holes at the backside (under air pressure).
The photocurrent–voltage characteristics were measured using an AM 1.5 solar simulator (Oriel solar simulator, 300 W Xenon lamp) with an active area of 0.26 cm2. The morphology of the nanotubes was characterized with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL, JSM-6340F). The phase composition was obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips, PW1830). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab, PGSTAT302N) under a forward bias (−0.75 V) in the dark. The testing frequency varied from 10−2–105 Hz with AC amplitude of 10 mA.

Broader context
To reduce electron scattering and increase energy absorption, anodic titania nanotube arrays have been vigorously investigated in an attempt to substitute the conventional nanoparticle photoanodes used in dye-sensitized solar cells. However, the use of nanotubes is not as efficient as that of nanoparticles, for example, the highest efficiencies are ∼7% vs. ∼11%. One of the most important factors is the low dye loading amount for light harvesting in the nanotube photoanodes, which, in turn, gives rise to a low photocurrent as well as a low conversion efficiency. In this study, a novel parallel configuration of dye-sensitized solar cells is achieved based on double-sided anodic nanotubes. This structure doubles the dye loading amount and promotes the photocurrent in a unit solar cell. The parallel cells exhibit an average 70% increase in photocurrent and 30% increment in efficiency in contrast to the single cells, as a consequence of a highly increased surface area and considerably reduced series resistance.
