1. Introduction
It is well known that CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have been increasing significantly during this century from 280 ppm in the pre-industrial era to ∼414.8 ppm in June 2021. It means an increase of approximately 40% more than in the 80's, with an increment of 2 ppm per year in the last 10 years.1 In 2016, the proportion of greenhouse gases coming from the energy sector was estimated to be around 73.2%, 16.2% being related to the transport sector.2 Meanwhile, in 2019, it was determined that 74% of greenhouse gas emissions was due to CO2 combustion.3 The environmental problem due to fossil fuel consumption is generating an energy sector revolution, driving a rapid change towards the future of renewable energy. However, the global transition is not moving fast enough.4 In the energy sector, renewable energies are increasingly preferred for new electricity generation. Approximately 181 GW of renewable energy capacity was added in 2018 (ref. 5) in contrast to 178 GW in 2017.6 The third part of the global energy generation comes from renewable energy.7 Developing countries such as the Marshall Islands, Rwanda, the Solomon Islands, and Guinea-Bissau, among others are investing more in renewable energy than developed and emerging economies.6
Several renewable energy technologies, such as hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal energy and heat, are major and cost-competitive sources of energy. Solar photovoltaic and wind energy have joined them and become very competitive with existing fossil fuel and nuclear power generation.6,8 These data show that the transition to renewable energy is feasible. The development of energy production technologies from renewable sources is the solution for sustainable energy generation and based on this fact, the need to develop techniques and methods to store this type of intermittent energy acquires great importance. Renewable energies can be transformed into other types of energy that can be stored and used when they are needed, the main energy storage techniques are classified as magnetic, electrochemical, hydro, air compressor, mechanical and thermal systems.9 Electrochemical capacitors or supercapacitors are among the most promising energy storage systems that store energy at a speed greater than that used by a conventional battery. Their capacities range from 10 to 5000 F, and they have very low internal resistance, properties that are achieved by large area electrodes that store charge in a double electrical layer and in some cases by faradaic processes (pseudocapacitance).10 The high speed of the charge–discharge process of this double layer leads to high power that distinguishes them from other power sources.
In particular, carbon-based supercapacitors have reported advantages such as high-power density, low weight, and flexible packaging in contrast to batteries or other storage systems.11 All these advantages have been based on the design of carbon-based porous supports with specific morphological characteristics, such as high specific surface area, defined porosity or hierarchical pore arrangements; in addition, they possess remarkable electrochemical properties such as high capacitance values, high charge–discharge speeds, and good stability during cycling.12,13 The most studied carbon materials for supercapacitors are carbon nanotubes (CNTs),14–16 graphene17–24 and mesoporous carbon.6,25,26 On the other hand, the use of biomass as a raw material has allowed the design of new carbon-based storage systems due to its natural macro–microporous structure, having excellent electrochemical and mechanical properties.27 For example, hierarchical porous carbon capacitors have been developed from cotton fibers treated with melanin, obtaining an area of 777 m2 g−1 and a capacitance of 360 F g−1.28 Treatment of cotton fibers before carbonization with a melamine/urea mixture at 800 °C produces a capacitor with a capacitance of 308 F g−1 with good stability during charge–discharge cycles.29 Furthermore, KOH-treated natural fibers are another way to expand the specific surface area and improve capacitive character. Cotton treated with KOH shows an increase in its surface area reaching values of 1435 m2 g−1 and 218 F g−1.30 Besides, graphene-derived compounds such as reduced graphene oxide (RGO) have been inserted on carbon obtained from cotton fabrics, reaching capacitance values of 219 F g−1.31 The use of porous biostructures as raw materials is proposed as a novel alternative in the design of energy storage systems.
On the other hand, the development of hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) has been reported as a very promising strategy, based on the combining of the outstanding power density of supercapacitive materials with the high energy density of battery-type (B-t) materials into a single device.32 Among the B-t materials, transition-metal oxides (TMOs) and transition-metal hydroxides (TMHs) have been reported as positive electrode materials for HSCs, as highlighted in some review articles.33–36 In fact, the great advantages of the TMOs and TMHs are due to their abundant resource, high electronegativity, rich redox reactions, low production costs, environment friendliness, excellent electrochemical performance35,37 and feasibility for assembly in hierarchical structures by integrating with other electrode materials.38 Furthermore, TMOs/TMHs have exhibited higher powder density and stability than traditional carbon and conducting polymer materials.38 For instance, recent progress on mono-39 and bimetallic oxides and their composites40 as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications was reported. Complementary to mono- and bimetallic oxides, Gonçalves et al.41 reviewed the recent progress in the development of trimetallic oxides/hydroxides as materials, especially on how strategies such as replacement and insertion of heteroatoms in electrode materials, nanostructuration, active site engineering based on the control of the crystalline phase and morphology, and their incorporation in conducting materials realizing composites, can influence the electrochemical performance of HSC electrode materials, suppressing the low conductivity, narrow working voltage window and small electrochemically active surface area usually present in TMOs/TMHs. In addition, Tomboc et al.42 summarized the developments in the design, synthetic routes, structural/chemical modification strategies, and applications of hybrid layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as multifunctional nanomaterials for electrochemical supercapacitors (and overall water splitting), while Jeong et al.43 presented a review of the synergetic effects originating from a combination of graphene and metal oxides. However, to the best of our knowledge, researchers have paid little attention to recent progress on the synergetic effects from biomass carbon-based materials in combination with metal oxides/hydroxides for supercapacitor applications in a comprehensive way. Therefore, in this review we focus on the recent progress and current trends in biomass carbon-based composites containing mono-, bi- and trimetallic metal oxides and hydroxides for supercapacitor applications. Finally, the prospects and possible future directions are discussed (Scheme 1).

2. Supercapacitor materials and devices
2.1 Energy storage mechanisms: EDLC and PC
Electrochemical capacitors or supercapacitors (SCs) are generally divided according to their capacitive behavior: electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors (PCs). EDLC behavior consists in an electrode–electrolyte interface that depends on rapid and reversible ion adsorption/desorption to form the electrical double layer capacitance (Fig. 1A).46 Thus, specific capacitance for EDL capacitors can be calculated as: (1)where εr, ε0, A, and d represent the dielectric constant of the electrolyte, vacuum permittivity, electrode specific surface area and EDL effective thickness (Debye length), respectively.
 Fig. 1  The schematic illustration of the energy storage mechanisms with their corresponding electrochemical signatures (representative shapes of CV and CD curves): (A–C) electrical double layer capacitance, (D–F) surface redox capacitance, (G–I) intercalation capacitance, and (J–L) faradaic battery-type. Reproduced with permission from ref. 52. Copyright © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH. 
Another capacitance behavior in electrodes is PC. It has a different mechanism to EDLC related to faradaic energy storage based on redox reaction on the surface or near-surface region of the electrode materials, ideally, two-dimensional (2D) or quasi-two-dimensional;47 in this region electrosorption or electrodesorption occurs with charge transfer but without bulk phase transformation. Thus, PC can be classified into three types according to Conway's statements: (i) underpotential deposition (UPD) (two-dimensional, 2D), (ii) surface redox system (Fig. 1D), and (iii) intercalation system (quasi-2D, Fig. 1G).10,47
These three pseudocapacitance mechanisms depend on the type of material, but the thermodynamics of the redox systems are similar. The thermodynamic potential depends on the occupancy fraction of electroactive species in the electrode material surface (eqn (2)), and the pseudocapacitance (Cpc, eqn (3)) can be expressed as follows (see ref. 48 for more details): (2) (3)where E is the electrode potential (V), q* is the charge required for completion of monolayer sorption, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1), T is the temperature (K), n is the number of transfer electrons, F is Faraday's constant (96485 C mol−1), and X is the occupancy fraction of the surface or lattice layer.
Therefore, pseudocapacitance is not constant and has a maximum value at X = 0.5. Thus, PC involves a surface-controlled process. Besides, unlike EDLC and PC behaviors, a B-t material (Fig. 1J) involves an ideal Nernstian process where a diffusion-controlled faradaic reaction occurs at a constant potential.49 Through electrochemical techniques the type of energy storage mechanism involved in the electrode can be determined, which will be described in the next section.

2.1.1 Profiles of EDLC, PC and B-t electrodes by electrochemical techniques. 
For EDLC the typical behavior is associated with non-faradaic reactions, and it is possible to observe cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves exhibiting a rectangular box-type form within a potential range (Fig. 1B), while galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) profiles show a symmetric triangular pattern (Fig. 1C). According to the pseudocapacitor behavior, these describe the materials that exhibit both CV and GCD profiles similar to EDLC, with quasi-rectangular CVs and quasi-triangular GCD curves. As mentioned above, one pseudocapacitor implies a surface redox, where the charge storage is mainly related with redox reactions occurring at the electrode surface. For example, MnO2 stores charges through the surface or bulk reactions between the +4 and +3 Mn oxidation states,50 with a CV and GCD profile similar to those of EDLC (Fig. 1E and F). Instead, the intercalation process implies faradaic charge transfer due to the intercalation of electrolyte ions into tunnels or layers in the material without crystallographic changes. Nb2O5 is a typical example of the intercalation pseudocapacitance,51 and the electrochemical profiles are shown in Fig. 1H and I. In contrast to a typical EDLC or PC behavior, B-t materials exhibit a completely different electrochemical behavior, and the CVs show a pair of waves related to oxidation and reduction processes, as can be seen for the behavior of NiO depicted in Fig. 1K, while the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves are characterized by a plateau where the potential remains almost constant while the faradaic process takes place (Fig. 1L).
It is important to mention that several materials selected in this work are based on TMOs and TMHs of nickel, cobalt, and vanadium, among others. Some of these materials exhibit purely faradaic behavior that implies a material conversion at a unique potential (experimentally in a reduced potential range) and the CV and GCD profiles are similar to those in Fig. 1K and L. Thus, the concept of capacitance is not appropriate for these materials, whose performance should be described based on the charge capacity concept (C, Coulomb or mA h) instead of capacitance (F).52,53 For a better understanding, in this review we add information (in the tables) about charge capacity in C or mA h for comparative purposes.

2.2 Symmetric, asymmetric and hybrid devices
Regarding SC devices, a classification that involves the nature of electrode materials as an anode (negative electrode) and cathode (positive electrode) can be enumerated as (i) symmetric, (ii) asymmetric and (iii) hybrid. In symmetric SC devices, both electrodes are made of the same EDLC or PC material, for example CSAC//CSAC (CSAC: coconut shell based activated carbon)54 and MnO2//MnO2.55 In asymmetric SC devices, there are two different materials, although the anode and cathode can be an EDLC and PC, such as MnO2//AC (AC: activated carbon).56 Similarly to asymmetric SCs, hybrid supercapacitors use different types of electrode material, but EDLC or PC materials are used with a B-t material, for example, CF@Ni–Al-LDH//AC (CF@Ni–Al-LDH: Ni–Al-layered double hydroxide supported on cotton stalk-derived carbon fibers).57
Therefore, the search for new electrode materials is an important topic for different supercapacitor devices. Different strategies have been proposed to optimize these electrodes, such as decreasing the particle size,58,59 controlling the morphology,41,60–63 and producing composite materials.41,64–66 Concerning the latter, the combination of materials with different capacitance behaviors has been studied. As a result, combination of EDLC, PC and B-t electrodes can improve the storage energy density without reducing power density and stability. Thus, this work focusses on new materials for electrodes that combine two or more electroactive materials (composites) based on activated carbons derived from biomass with mono-, bi- and trimetallic oxides or hydroxides.
2.3 Biomass-derived carbon
The use of sustainable materials is fundamental for the positioning of any current emerging technology. Based on this purpose, in the last decade, researchers have shown increased interest in supercapacitors, demanding the use of carbon derived from biomass. Activated carbon materials exhibit an EDLC mechanism to store energy. Hence, in order to employ them in supercapacitive devices, some aspects are important: (i) large specific capacitance, (ii) low equivalent series resistance and (iii) cyclability and long lifetime.67,68 The success of these characteristics is closely related to the biomass-derived carbon, carbonization and chemical activation processes.

2.3.1 Precursors of biomass-derived carbon and structure. 
There are different precursors for the synthesis of carbon materials. It could be thought that any biological material with a high carbon content can be used. This section explores the characteristics of precursors based on (i) plants, (ii) fruits, (iii) microorganisms and (iv) animals69,70 (Fig. 2A).

Generally, the carbon biomass precursor most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials, called lignocellulosic biomass. This latter is due to its composition containing biopolymers such as lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose.70–72 Lignin is the second most abundant aromatic bio-polymer in plants and its structure is composed of 3 main alcohols: p-coumaryl, coniferyl and sinapyl.71,73 Cellulose is composed only of β-glucose molecules (homo-polysaccharides) different to hemicellulose that can be referred to as a class of short chains of different sugar units consisting of five- and six-carbon sugars (xylose, arabinose, galactose, mannose, glucose and fructose)74 (Fig. 2B). Lignin has the highest thermal stability and can contribute to all chars and the structure of activated carbons.75 Moreover, hydroxyl groups in cellulose and hemicellulose are less thermally stable than lignin and have a low contribution to the carbon content in the final chars.75,76 However, in the presence of hydroxyl groups, cellulose and hemicellulose undergo decomposition and dehydration condensation leading to plentiful micropores.76
Fruit-based biomass presents different compositions compared to plant-based biomass. The main composition of fruit-based biomass includes crude fibers, crude proteins, lipids, ash, carbohydrates and others.77,78 Crude fibers are made up of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. Fruit biomass-derived carbon properties and carbon yield depend on crude fiber content, which in general is low. For example, raw peels of avocados, watermelons, bananas and pineapples show 46.9, 39.1, 16.3 and 24.2% of crude fibers, respectively.77 Likewise, the pulp of avocados, watermelons, bananas and pineapples shows 41.1, 2.8, 2.9 and 5.4% of crude fibers, respectively.77 Despite the low yield of carbon from fruit biomass due to the high content of crude proteins and lipids that suffer from thermal decomposition to volatile compounds like CO2, H2O, ammonia gases (NH3), olefins, and low weight alcohols and esters at relatively low temperature, these subproducts can act as activators improving the porosity to some extent on the carbon structure.79,80 Furthermore, one advantage of fruit-based biomass is the presence of heteroatoms in its composition due to the high content of nitrogen and phosphorus on crude proteins and lipids.79,81
The chemical composition of microorganism-based biomass includes carbohydrates, crude proteins, crude fibers, crude fat, and ash.69,82–85 The key feature in this biomass is the presence of carbohydrates. For example, biopolymers such as chitin are capable of forming hydrogen interactions and crosslinking networks of chitin–glucan86,87 and chitin–catecholamine complexes88 (Fig. 2C). The result is a structural stability to carbon chars during the thermal carbonization.86,89 In addition, a structural protein called “keratin” has been studied. There are two types of keratin, α-keratin and β-keratin, by which the primary structures consist of amino acids90 (Fig. 2D). Due to the strong covalent and non-covalent bonding within its molecular structure and high sulfur content, keratin shows sufficient stability during the thermal carbonization process, generating high-quality biomass-derived carbons in high yield.91,92 Finally, it is also important to mention that animal-based biomass presents high content of nitrogen and phosphorus.
Several studies have obtained carbon just with biomass pyrolysis, using its intrinsic composition and structure. However, the use of physical and chemical activation can help biomass to obtain a high-quality carbon, with relevant electrochemical properties to be used in the development of supercapacitor electrode materials. The following section will discuss these strategies.


2.3.2 Synthetic strategies for biomass-derived carbon. 
As mentioned above, the intrinsic biomass composition is important for the optimal synthesis of activated carbon for applications in SCs. In the same way, strategies for converting biomass into carbon have the same relevance.70 To obtain carbon from biomass, different carbonization methods can be utilized such as pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization. Also, activation methods (e.g. physical, chemical and other activations) can be used for the generation of a specific chemical surface, surface area and pore volume in the material (Scheme 2). The carbonization increases the carbon content in a carbonaceous material at temperatures below 800 °C, and the activation implies the generation of a specific chemical surface, surface area and pore volume in the material. Several combinations of these methods are used to increase carbon properties such as specific surface area, presence of heteroatoms, micro- and meso-porosity ratio, conductivity and morphology.70

Carbonization processes include pyrolysis and/or hydrothermal processes. Pyrolysis occurs in an inert or limited oxygen atmosphere at different temperatures95 and the impurities present in the biomass precursor act as reagents helping in carbon activation.76 In the case of hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), the process involves a biomass conversion to a hydrochar structure with a high density of oxygen-containing groups and low condensation degree.95,96 The HTC and pyrolysis generally use temperatures between 200 and 300 °C, and 300 and 600 °C, respectively.97 It is important to note that in most studies the first step to form a biomass-derived carbon involves a hydrothermal process with a subsequent carbonization by pyrolysis. This previous step is applied, considering that direct pyrolysis promotes the formation of carbon materials with a low specific surface area and poor porous distribution.95
On the other hand, the activation processes are classified mainly as physical activation and chemical activation. Physical activation requires the carbonization in a range between 400 and 850 °C conducted in the presence of gas, mainly air, steam, or CO2.98 Regarding chemical activation, various molecules such as KOH, ZnCl2 and H3PO4 are commonly used and some rarely employed activation reagents are H2SO4, K2CO3, NaOH and their mixtures.70,99 Currently, KOH is the molecule preferred to be used as an activation agent for biomass-derived carbon for SC electrodes. During biomass pyrolysis with KOH as a chemical activator, first the KOH reacts with active O-containing species in the biomass and prevents them from generating vacancies. These vacancies are occupied for OH− ions forming new O-containing groups in the biochar. Finally, KOH transforms to K2CO3 at 400–600 °C, and to K2O at 800 °C. In this process, large amounts of gaseous products (due in great part to the precursor biomass composition) are released, improving the biochar porosity.100 ZnCl2 is another commonly used chemical activation agent for converting biomass into carbon. During the activation process, the ZnCl2 acts as a Lewis acid, aiding in the cleavage of the glucosidic linkages101 of the biomass-precursor, resulting in reaction energy reduction during carbon activation. In a second step, the metal cation complex, [Zn(H2O)6]2+, participates as a nucleophile to yield D-glucose.102 A similar mechanism can be observed for AlCl3 and FeCl3 salts.103,104

3. Oxide/biomass-derived carbon composites
3.1 Monometallic oxide/biomass-derived carbon composites
An accepted way to increase the carbon materials' performance for supercapacitor applications is to mix them with transition-metal oxides (TMOs), which can promote highly reversible redox processes.105 The most common metals employed in these electrodes are manganese, cobalt, nickel, iron, ruthenium, iridium, molybdenum, vanadium and tin.47 Different oxides of these elements can be present in a mixture conforming a supercapacitor electrode, but the most basic electrode would be built with monometallic oxides. With composites composed of monometallic TMOs and carbon materials it is possible to control the electrochemical behavior, since only one redox species (in this case, the transition metal) is involved in the electrochemical reaction.106 During the electrode charge/discharge process, the transition metal is submitted to a redox process, generating changes on the electrode surface charge compensated by the electrostatic exchange of cations or anions from the bulk electrolyte.107 Furthermore, these composites are stable in the presence of different electrolytes and depending on their preparation, it is possible to obtain oxides that are highly dispersed on the carbon support.108,109 Several authors have prepared mixtures of monometallic TMOs and synthetic carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes,110–112 carbon fibers,113,114 carbon aerogels115,116 and activated carbons.105 More interesting are the investigations concerning the preparation of these composites using biomass-derived carbons, although few reports can be found in the literature. This section reports the most relevant studies on monometallic oxide/biomass carbon composites, emphasizing on their synthetic routes and performance in terms of resistance to electron transfer, specific capacitance Cs, rate retention capability, cycling stability, energy density E and power density P, besides surface area, porosity and metal oxide dispersion on the carbon matrix.

3.1.1 Electrodes based on manganese oxide/biomass-derived carbons. 
Manganese is recognized as a common metal employed in electrodes for supercapacitors due to its wide potential window, stability and well-known redox properties.117 Generally, the deposition of manganese oxides on biomass carbons can be performed by different routes, but the most common is the hydrothermal procedure, as reported by He et al.,118 who deposited MnO2 nanosheets on carbon cloth produced by carbonization of natural flax fibers, which have been hydrothermally treated with a KMnO4 solution at 60 °C in a Teflon-lined autoclave. The nanosheet structure affected the capacitance performance of the composite, which achieved values of around 683.73 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and cycling stability with 94% retention after 1000 cycles in 0.1 mol L−1 Na2SO4. Yang et al.119 have prepared MnO2/biomass-derived carbon composites by carbonization of previously KOH-activated banana peels, forming a highly rich 3D-porous structure. This composite exhibited a specific capacitance of 123 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1 mol L−1 Na2SO4, and good cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 92.3% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1. In other work, hemp stems have also been used as a precursor for activated carbons (HC),120 which were employed as a support of MnO2 nanowires, forming a composite with improved specific capacitance compared with that displayed by both materials separately. HC behaved as a current collector and anchored electroactive materials, leading to a specific capacitance of around 340 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 and a high capacitance retention close to 88% in the range of 1 to 30 A g−1. The authors attributed the good capacitive properties of these composites to the open-pore system of HC that promotes ion and electron transport. The materials also presented a high performance when tested in asymmetric supercapacitors with 3D-activated carbon as an anode and the MnO2/HC composite as a cathode, delivering an energy density of 33 W h kg−1 at 14.8 kW kg−1. Composites composed of biomass-derived carbons and MnO2 can also be formed by mixing the original biomass source with the manganese salt, both in the solid state and aqueous solution. For instance, Zhang et al.121 prepared a composite by absorption of Mn2+ solution into agarics, followed by calcination at 800 °C. The resulting composite possessed a nanostructure with high specific surface area, improved electron transfer and excellent electrolyte wettability which enhanced the ion transportation. Capacitance values of around 637 F g−1 at 2.5 A g−1 and capacitance retentions close to 91% at 10 mA cm−2 after 5000 cycles, which were obtained in 3 mol L−1 KOH, represent the improved performance of the as-obtained material. Zhao et al.122 synthesized a composite composed of hierarchical porous carbon and manganese monoxide nanosheets by thermal treatment of waste litchi shells mixed with KMnO4 and KOH at 800 °C. This material showed a crystalline structure, as well as high surface area and pore distribution leading to a high specific capacitance of 703.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH and energy densities close to 58 W h kg−1 at 400 W kg−1. Yu et al.123 prepared MnO microcubes embedded in porous carbons from agarics, obtaining materials with a capacitance of 325 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1 mol L−1 Na2SO4, energy densities close to 46.1 W h kg−1 at 1.0 kW kg−1 and a long-term cyclability of 91% after 10000 cycles.

Fig. 3 shows the morphology and electrochemical performance of MnOx/C materials with the highest specific capacitance values according to this review, as can be seen in Tables 1 and 2. These materials are supported on biomass carbons coming from natural flax fibers (Fig. 3A)118 and litchi shells (Fig. 3E).122 The natural flax fiber-carbon exhibited cross-linked fibers (Fig. 3B), while carbon micro-sized particles with a cambered surface were obtained from the litchi shells (Fig. 3F). Fig. 3C and G present the morphology of the MnOx/C composites with the highest electrochemical performance, which are MCFC1 and HPC–MnO-0.03, respectively. The MCFC1 material involved the use of a small amount of KMnO4 during the synthesis procedure and displayed the highest specific capacitance at different current densities, as can be seen in Fig. 3D.118 In the case of HPC–MnO-0.03, which also contains an intermediate concentration of Mn oxides, the highest capacitive current densities were observed by CV, as depicted in Fig. 3H. In both cases, the authors have emphasized on the crucial role of MnOx particle sizes in the capacitance, which is related to the concentration of KMnO4 employed during the synthesis. High concentrations of these precursors do not guarantee the obtaining of particles with high pseudocapacitance performance, due to the increase in the sizes of these particles, which involves a decrease in the electrode's active area. Thus, it is possible to conclude that the KMnO4 precursor amount must guarantee the obtaining of MnOx/C materials with adequate particle sizes improving their capacitance.

3.1.2 Electrodes based on nickel oxide/biomass-derived carbons. 
Nickel oxides and nickel oxide/biomass carbon composites have also been suggested as potential materials for supercapacitors, bearing in mind that nickel addresses a redox process between Ni2+ and Ni3+ under different pH conditions125 and protects against corrosion in different media, guaranteeing the stability and long-term duration of different materials and surfaces.126 Plating of carbons has been reported by Abioye et al.,127 who prepared an activated carbon (AC) from oil palm shells, which was submitted to a nickel electroless plating and calcination at 300, 400 and 500 °C. These nanocomposites were evaluated in a two-electrode supercapacitor device and a correlation between the specific capacitances and the calcination temperature was found, since lower treatment temperatures produced the materials with the highest capacitance. The material treated at 300 °C displayed a specific capacitance of around 362 F g−1 in 1 mol L−1 H2SO4 and the highest specific energy density values (14.29 W h kg−1 at 0.25 kW kg−1), values attributed to the NiO crystalline structure, the carbon flake structure and the presence of channels promoting the transport of electrochemical species. Zhao et al.128 also deposited nickel nanoparticles by electroless plating on cellulose fibers from soft wood. This material displayed a Cs close to 268 F g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH at 0.2 A g−1, with a 97% capacity retention after 2000 cycles, this being proof of the electrochemical stability conferred by the carbon–NiO junction. Hydrothermal treatments have also been employed to prepare biomass-derived carbon/NiO composites, as reported by Xu et al.129 These authors prepared porous interconnected carbon nanosheets doped with nitrogen, oxygen and nickel (PICNs) from soybean stalk with urea as a doping agent. Materials with specific surface area higher than 2200 m2 g−1, a pore diameter of 1.89 nm, and N and O contents of 5.08% and 9.4%, respectively, were obtained. Furthermore, these materials displayed a specific capacitance of 407 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH, capacitance retentions of around 79% at 20 A g−1 and cycling stability with 93.75% retention after 10000 cycles, besides an energy density Es of 36.11 W h kg−1 at 518 W kg−1. In other interesting work, Kishore et al.130 mixed infant-urinated waste diaper absorbents with nickel nitrate to carbonize this mixture at 800 °C. The biomass source provided nitrogen to the carbon material, while NiO acted as the pseudocapacitor component of the composite. The as-synthesized material exhibited two structural configurations embedding the NiO nanoparticles: carbon nanofibers and porous carbons, which favored the formation of active sites and thus the interaction with the electrolyte, leading to a specific capacitance of 356 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 in 2 mol L−1 KOH and cycling stability with 93% retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1.
Electroless plating and hydrothermal methods as routes to produce NiO/C composites are summarized in Fig. 4. In the first case, ACNiO-300 was synthesized by electroless deposition of nickel oxides on oil palm shell-derived carbon (see Fig. 4A) and developed the highest specific capacitance.127 According to the authors, the interconnected micro-/mesopores shown in Fig. 4B present in the composite structure benefited the ion diffusion, leading to prolonged times to complete the charge/discharge process (see Fig. 4C). Furthermore, 300 °C was the ideal temperature to keep the interconnected pore network and enhance the electrochemical performance of the material. Concerning the materials prepared by hydrothermal routes, soybean stalk (Fig. 4D) and infant diapers (Fig. 4G) as starting materials were employed to form composites with interconnected pores from soybean stalk (Fig. 4E) and carbon fibers well coated with nanoparticles from waste infant diapers (Fig. 4H). These materials provided high specific capacitances, a fact associated with the presence of nitrogen as a dopant in the biomass-derived carbons, considering the impregnation of soybean stalk with urea before the autoclave treatment (Fig. 4F)129 and the presence of uric acid and urea in the case of the infant-waste diapers (Fig. 4I).130 The authors have mentioned that nitrogen increased the material's electrical conductivity, therefore improving the capacitance developed for these materials. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the physicochemical and electrochemical properties, respectively, of the herein-presented composites composed of nickel oxides and biomass-derived carbons.

3.1.3 Electrodes based on iron oxide/biomass-derived carbons. 
Iron oxides are suitable materials for supercapacitors, due to their natural abundance, low cost, eco-friendly nature, physicochemical stability and large theoretical capacitance (∼3625 F g−1).134–136 The Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple is responsible for their pseudocapacitive properties and its electrochemical behavior has already been characterized.137 However, iron oxides possess low electrical conductivity (around 10−4 to 10−3 S m−1), a fact that promotes their deposition on carbon materials to compensate for this drawback.138,139 Keeping this in mind, Fang et al.140 decorated a wheat straw-derived carbon with an Fe2O3 ultrathin film deposited by annealing with a previously absorbed Fe(NO3)3·9H2O ethanol solution. The as-obtained material displayed a specific capacitance close to 988 F g−1 operating at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 3 mol L−1 KOH, besides a great rate capability of 423.8 F g−1 at 30 A g−1 and 82.6% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. When this material was tested as an anode in an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor, a high energy density of 96.7 W h kg−1 was determined at 20.65 kW kg−1. The electrochemical performance of this material was attributed to the hierarchical architecture of the carbon support and graphitic planes, which improved the redox activity of Fe2O3. In other work, Jiang et al.141 supported Fe2O3 nanoparticles on a porous activated carbon material prepared from hemp straw. The iron oxide nanoparticles were prepared by hydrothermal reaction of FeSO4·7H2O with polyethylene glycol at 160 °C in the presence of biomass carbon. These nanoparticles did not display agglomeration on the biomass carbon surface, leading to stable contact between the Fe2O3 and the electrolyte. Thus, high specific capacitances of around 256 F g−1 were detected in a three electrode-cell, as well as a capacity retention higher than 72.6% after 1000 cycles in 6 mol L−1 KOH. The electrochemical performance of this electrode was attributed to the favorable anchoring of nanosized Fe2O3 particles on the carbon support and its high dispersion. Yu et al.142 aligned α-Fe2O3 nanorods on hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) derived from wheat flour treated by the hydrothermal route, followed by carbonization. The α-Fe2O3 structures were obtained by an autoclave treatment of aqueous Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Na2SO4 in the presence of a carbon material. In 1 mol L−1 Li2SO4, this composite exhibited a specific capacitance of 706 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a two-fold value compared to that observed for the unsupported α-Fe2O3 structures. In combination with a carbon supported on polyaniline (PANI) electrode in an asymmetrical supercapacitor, a total capacitance of 706 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 was produced, delivering an energy density of 117 W h kg−1 at 1.0 kW kg−1 with a low decay in capacitance of 5.8% after 5000 cycles, confirming the excellent electrode stability. This study demonstrated that interconnected porous structures supporting iron oxides can enhance the electrode's capacitive properties. Another alternative is the formation of iron oxides embedded in the biomass carbon structure, acting as a dopant component. Li et al.143 prepared a microflower-structured biochar doped with highly dispersed α-Fe2O3 and nitrogen following a molten salt route. The use of different gases during the carbonization stage induced the formation of different oxides species as follows: α-Fe2O3 in the presence of air and Fe3O4 in the presence of Ar, due to the variation in the biomass reducing power. The synergy between the α-Fe2O3 and the biomass carbon generated specific capacitances of around 452.3 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 with a rate capability of 17.9 W h kg−1 at 400 W kg−1 in 2 mol L−1 KOH. Moreover, the composite was tested as an anode in a supercapacitor operating with a manganese oxide electrode as a cathode. The iron oxide structure, its small crystallite size and good dispersion in the biomass carbon were stated by the authors as reasons for the high performance. The alga Cladophora glomerata has been used by Pourhosseini et al.144 to synthesize a biomass carbon composite with iron oxides, by mixing it with FeCl3 and KOH, followed by pyrolysis. The structure of this material was rich in 3D interconnected pores, promoting the transport of the ions present in the electrolyte and generating electrodes with a specific capacitance of 368 F g−1, energy density of 41.5 W h kg−1 and capacitance retention of 102.1% after 10000 cycles in 3 mol L−1 KCl. Thus, the authors suggested an alternative for the use of excessively growing macroalgae, which are present in different coastal areas, a phenomenon promoted by the increase of environmental pollutants. Bamboo and Fe2(SO4)3 were also employed by Xu et al.145 in the synthesis of an Fe-decorated porous carbon by hydrothermal carbonization and KHCO3 activation, obtaining a carbon material with a high surface area (1509.5 m2 g−1), spherical structure and high content of pores. These properties had an impact on the electrochemical properties such as the capacitance, generating 467 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 1 mol L−1 Na2SO4, and the retention rate capability after 5000 cycles, which just decreased by 0.2%. Furthermore, a maximum energy of 20.31 W h kg−1 at 225 W kg−1 was determined when this material was tested as an electrode in a symmetric capacitor.
The highly porous structures and conductivity conferred by the carbon support are the factors affecting the capacitance of the synthesized material. Fig. 5 shows the SEM images and the electrochemical performance of Fe2O3/C composites formed from wheat straw (Fig. 5A), wheat flour (Fig. 5D) and bamboo (Fig. 5G) which are reported in ref. 140, 142 and 145, respectively. In the case of BPC/Fe2O3, the porous structure (see Fig. 5B) of the wheat straw-derived carbon and the thin Fe2O3 film improved the ion diffusion, enabling the activity on Fe2O3 sites and thus enhancing the specific capacitance at different currents, as can be seen in Fig. 5C. A similar dependence was found for the composite based on carbons prepared from wheat flour (HPC) and α-Fe2O3. α-Fe2O3 formed an interconnected structure on the carbon, as observed in Fig. 5E, with different pore sizes that enhanced the surface area, ensuring access to the ions and guaranteeing their transport. This fact leads to prolonged charge/discharge times for the α-Fe2O3/HPC composite, in comparison with those for α-Fe2O3 and HPC as separated electrodes (see Fig. 5F). In addition to the porosity effects, conductivity is a factor affecting the electrode's activity. Thus, activated carbon (AC) formed from bamboo (Fig. 5G)145 possesses high conductivity, promoting electron transfer. In this work, the combination with iron oxides leads to AC–Fe-10% (Fig. 5H) as the material developing the highest capacitance in comparison with the AC carbon and the composites with lower/higher concentrations of Fe (AC–Fe-5% and AC–Fe-20%, respectively, see Fig. 5I). Therefore, it is possible to state that a high concentration of Fe oxides meant a decrease in the electrical conductivity of the composite, but a low concentration of these species was detrimental to the pseudocapacitive properties. From these studies, it is possible to conclude that a combination of adequate amounts of well-structured Fe2O3 and biomass-derived carbon materials, forming a composite with high electrical conductivity, is the most important factor in the synthesis of Fe2O3/C composites with high capacitance. The main physicochemical properties of
the herein-described materials are reported in Table 1, while Table 2 reports their capacitive properties.

As shown previously, great efforts have been made in the use of biomass-derived carbon as a support material to prevent aggregation of nanomaterials and to increase the conductivity and stability of electrodes.150 Another important factor is the design of bi- and trimetallic TMOs. In fact, the presence of two metals with unique properties in the same structure improves the conductivity and stability during charge and discharge processes. Some general properties of TMO composites and carbon can be listed: electronic conductivity, structural stability, high ion diffusion rate, electrochemical activity, low activation energy for electron transfer among the centers, and abundant active sites.36,41,151
Among the bimetallic oxides, cobaltites with a spinel structure of MCo2O4 (M = Co, Ni, Mn, Zn, Cu and Fe) have been extensively studied and applied as materials for energy storage, especially those based on NiCo2O4,152 MnCo2O4 (ref. 37) and CuCo2O4.153 These compounds are promising candidates for electrodes in supercapacitors. Materials with a spinel structure and bimetallic composition can facilitate various redox reactions compared to monometallic oxides.154 Accordingly, nickel cobaltite NiCo2O4 presents a higher conductivity than its monometallic oxides, as shown in the following order: NiCo2O4 > NiO > Co3O4.155 Bimetallic oxides such as NiCo2O4 have received a lot of interest due to their low cost, abundance, low toxicity, and easy control of their morphology, size and structural composition.36,154
At this point, it is important to note that the strategies mentioned above are also trends towards the development of composites based on bimetallic oxide/biomass-derived carbon. In fact, Tables 3 and 4 show that several researchers have developed composites that contain biomass-derived carbons combined with different cobaltites, especially Ni cobaltite. For instance, the 2D nanostructures of NiCo2O4 have been supported on biomass-derived carbon with the aim of obtaining a synergic effect between B-t and EDLC electrode materials. Thus, the major goal of the bimetallic oxide/biomass-derived carbon is to improve the electrochemical properties of charge storage through modification of various aspects, for instance: biomass precursor type, biomass carbonization and activation, morphology of carbon materials and bimetallic oxide morphology.

To achieve a better electrochemical performance, the choice of biomass is essential due to its chemical and structural composition. As mentioned above, components such as lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and proteins, among others69,156 can help in the carbon porosity formation and the creation of sites with a defined structural arrangement in which oxides can be uniformly dispersed. Additionally, heteroatom insertion in composites can improve their electrochemical properties, as is the case of biomass-precursors that contain N, P and S within their chemical composition.157 To develop the aforementioned composites, Guo et al.,158 Yang et al.159 and Yuanchao Pang et al.160 used different biomass precursors, for example pomelo peel, gelatin and raupo, for the synthesis of biomass-derived carbon as a supporting material. The pomelo peel contains a large number of pectins (pectins are a family of complex polysaccharides present in plant cell walls161) within its composition, making it a promising candidate to prepare 3D porous carbon structures, with a large number of interconnected pores. In the same way, gelatin and raupo present nitrogen atoms that are uniformly incorporated into the carbon structure during the carbonization process, improving its electrical conductivity and increasing its surface polarity, thus promoting a better specific interaction with polar adsorbates. In addition, the formation of mesopores and macropores helps to incorporate and uniformly distribute the oxides into its structure. Fig. 6A, D and G show the SEM images of honeycomb-like porous biomass carbon (HLPBC) from grapefruit, three-dimensional gelatin-based carbon–nickel foam (GCNF) from gelatin and amorphous micron-sized carbon ribbons (AMCRs) from raupo, respectively. HLPBC is a 3D hierarchical carbonaceous material that has a high surface area, with high macroporosity in the form of a honeycomb, and this structure allows the growth of oxides on its surface. Meanwhile, the biomass-derived carbon of GCNF and AMCRs exhibited a porous structure and a high conductivity due to the presence of nitrogen atoms in their structure, which facilitates charge transfer.162 In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra for GCNF showed a broad peak at 26.7° which is characteristic of the (002) plane of graphitic carbon. The graphitic carbon in GCNF provides a higher conductivity, high-rate capability and high cycling stability compared to amorphous carbon obtained in HLPBC and AMCR biomass-derived carbons.

Moreover, the 2D NiCo2O4 spinel morphologies with the shape of nanosheets, nanoflowers and ultra-thin nanosheets are shown in Fig. 6B, E and H supported on HLPBC, GCNF and AMCRs, respectively. The HLPBC/NiCo2O4 electrode material presents a specific capacitance of 1137.5 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of 90.5% after 5000 cycles and a rate capability of 61.53% (5–10 A g−1) in 2 mol L−1 KOH.158 These properties are explained based on its 2D nanosheet morphology that provides a pathway for the diffusion of ions, and its large surface area allows greater contact with the electrolyte than for other structures. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) results showed a low interfacial charge transfer resistance Rct of 0.9 Ω that indicates good electrical conductivity. Also, the high cycling stability can also be attributed to its porous structure that helps alleviate volume changes during charge–discharge processes. In comparison, NiCo2O4/GCNF presented a specific capacitance of 1416 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH. The SEM images of NiCo2O4/GCNF showed porous structures of nanoflowers, which were composed of NiCo2O4 nanosheets/nanoneedles with a low Rct of 0.59 Ω. These 3D network structures help to increase electroactive sites, shorten ion diffusion paths, and promote rapid transport of ions and electrons.158
Besides, NiCo2O4 in NiCo2O4@AMCRs is deposited in the form of ultra-thin nanosheets (Fig. 6H), and these nanosheets are interwoven with each other to construct a 3D framework increasing the surface area and active sites. The NiCo2O4@AMCR composite demonstrated a high capacitance of 1691 F g−1 at a current density of 3 A g−1 using 2 mol L−1 KOH, with a retention of capacitance of 89% after 10000 cycles. Besides, at 10 A g−1, its capacitance was 1546 F g−1, this value being higher than those of NiO@AMCR and CoO@AMCR (681 and 962 F g−1), respectively. This increase in specific capacitance is due to a synergic effect between the bimetallic oxides and the defects created in the amorphous carbon. Furthermore, the contribution of nitrogen atoms generates greater amounts of active sites, improving their electrical conductivity.159
In addition to the XRD results shown, the NiCo2O4/HLPBC and NiCo2O4/GCNF compounds exhibited a NiCo2O4 oxide with low crystallinity. The poor crystallinity can promote the generation of oxygen vacancy defects, improving the electrical conductivity of NiCo2O4.163,164 Also, the high specific surface area, superior conductivity and low crystallinity result in better diffusion kinetics of OH− ions in the NiCo2O4 electrode.163 The three compounds showed great capacitances with long charge and discharge times as shown in Fig. 6C, F and J, which shows the synergic effect of carbonaceous support and bimetallic oxide.
In the same way, CoFe2O4 and NiMn2O4 spinel structures have been studied. In fact, CoFe2O4 received much attention due to its chemical stability and high theoretical specific capacity of 916 mA h g−1.165,166 Fu et al.167 used crab waste as a biomass precursor for the synthesis of crab-derived carbon (CDC). Crab waste contains a large number of proteins, chitins and inorganic salts such as calcium and magnesium, that can make a promising candidate to prepare multi-hierarchical carbon structures with micro-, meso- and macropores. CDC presented a high surface area of 1601.55 m2 g−1 with three average pore sizes: less than 2 nm, 16 nm and 73 nm. Also, this carbon showed two diffraction peaks at 24° and 44° corresponding to the planes of (002) and (100), respectively. The CDC/CoFe2O4 composite presented a specific capacitance of 701.8 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of 90.9% after 10000 cycles and a good rate capability of 62.3% (from 1 to 10 A g−1) using 6 mol L−1 KOH.
Additionally, NiMn2O4 oxides with a spinel structure have been studied due to their high conductivity, good stability and energy storage capacity.168 For example, Zhang et al.169 synthesized a NiMn2O4/3DPNG composite (3DPNG: three-dimensional N-doped porous graphene) derived from loofah biomass, obtaining a capacitance of 1308.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a rate capability of 77.9% at current densities of 1 to 15 A g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH. The main factors for these electrochemical properties were the in situ growth of NiMn2O4 nanoparticles and the graphene-like structure of carbon that provided easy access to ions in the structure and an effective electron transport path for electrochemical reactions (MO/MO–OH).169,170
Other Ni–Co oxides have also been studied as NiCo2O4. For example, F. Golmohammadi et al.171 reported a composite of NFKP/NiCoO2 using as biomass-derived carbon from Typha domingensis or Karrapo (NFKP corresponds to nanofiber Karrapo). In this synthesis no chemical activator was used (Fig. 7A). The NFKP carbonaceous support presented a morphology of cylindrical nanofibers (Fig. 7B) and the composite showed a uniform distribution of NiCoO2 particles on the carbon support (Fig. 7C and D) with a highly crystalline cubic phase due to the pyrolysis at 700 °C for 3 h in an Ar atmosphere (Fig. 7A). The electrochemical measurements in a three electrode-cell showed a specific capacitance of 1770 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH with a capacitance retention of 93% after 5000 cycles with a high-rate capability of 60% at a current density of 66 A g−1. The electrochemical nature of the NFKP/NiCoO2 composite led to two redox peaks in the potential window of approximately – 20 mV to 480 mV (vs. SCE) related to the redox process and the formation of two species, NiOOH (high electrochemical performance) and CoOOH (high conductivity). Also, the successive CVs at different scan rates (20 mV s−1 to 200 mV s−1) showed high reversibility, suggesting a high-rate capability for the supercapacitor (Fig. 7E). Furthermore, the NFKP/NiCoO2 composite presents a high porosity with abundant micro- and mesopores with an average size of 2–5 nm and a surface area of 110 m2 g−1 (Table 4); these pores can provide active sites for energy storage and facilitate ion transport during the charge–discharge process, resulting in its high capacitance (Fig. 7F). The authors also investigated the NFKP/Ni–Co electrode's electrochemical ability as a positive electrode against a Vulcan XC-72R (VC) electrode as an anode (device denoted as NFKP/Ni–Co//VC), according to the GCD studies. The device showed a small IR drop with a capacitance retention of 65% (from 1 A g−1 to 25 A g−1) and a long-term cycling stability and durability, after 5000 cycles. Consistent with Table 4, the energy density of 101.1 W h kg−1 and power density of 25.6 kW kg−1 are the highest, and this best performance can be attributed to the presence of abundant micropores and mesopores and to the uniform dispersion of Ni–Co oxides in the material favored by the diameter of Ni–Co oxide (∼20 nm, Fig. 7D) and the relatively low oxide loading in the carbon (0.155 mmol of Ni + Co salts per 40 mg of biomass NFKP, see Table 3).

Along the same lines, to show the importance of the number of redox processes, other oxides have been studied, like in the case of Sn and Mo. Although Mo oxides have low structural stability during charge and discharge processes,172 according to Table 4 the composite of SnMo–O@P-HPC-700 showed the highest specific capacitance in the reviewed papers of 2121.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1.173 In this work, Wang et al.173 synthesized the SnMoO4@P-HPC-X composite (P-HPC-X: P-doped hierarchical porous carbon, X: pyrolyzing temperature of the composite), where the carbon was derived from sodium alginate (SA) biomass. SA is expected to become an ideal precursor for carbon production, since it can be easily extracted from marine biomass and forms a 3D hierarchical porous framework during the carbonization process (Fig. 7G). Also, SA is an excellent biomass precursor that serves as a platform to crosslink some N, S and P heteroatoms, and these heteroatoms can easily be introduced into its structure forming gels that later in the pyrolysis process are introduced as dopants into the carbon structure (Fig. 7H).174 The synthesis of the composite was carried out via an in situ reduction obtaining the P-doped composites: SnMo–O@P-HPC-600, SnMo–O@P-HPC-700 and SnMo–O@P-HPC-800. SnMo–O@P-HPC-700 presented the highest surface area of 216 m2 g−1, pore volume of 0.140 cm3 g−1 and average pore size of 3.94 nm (see Table 3). The high specific capacitance for SnMo–O@P-HPC-700 of 2121.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH is due to its interesting redox behavior (Fig. 7J and K). Faradaic processes developed in SnMo–O@P-HPC occur through three charge transfer processes: Mo to Mo4+, Mo4+ to Mo6+ and Sn to Sn4+ (Fig. 7J). These redox processes generate a gain of around 10 e− in the overall process. Also, the presence of P atoms within the carbonaceous structure, high surface area and high porosity favor electron transfer and improve their electrochemical properties. Besides it is important to note the relatively low oxide loading in the carbon (0.0008 mmol of Sn + Mo/mg of biomass SA, see Table 3), which, as mentioned above, can favor the homogeneous dispersion of the oxides deposited on the carbon (Fig. 7I).
3.3 Trimetallic oxide/biomass-derived carbon composites
The trend of metal oxides is the synthesis of trimetallic composites with the aim of further improving the electrochemical properties through multiple redox reactions.41 From the few studies found in the literature using carbon derived from biomass, it is possible to mention Ramkumar et al.175 who synthesized LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2@C composites using glucose as a biomass precursor, obtaining a specific capacity of 30 mA h g−1 at a current density of 3 mA g−1 using 0.5 mol L−1 Li2SO4 as a supporting electrolyte. The authors observed that the behavior of the LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2 structure in the range of 0–0.6 V depends mainly on the nickel ion because the cobalt is active at higher voltages and the manganese does not participate in the redox reaction, but it helps to stabilize the crystal structure. Besides, the carbon composite on the LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2@C positive electrode enhances the conductive network and acts as a buffer layer to accommodate the stress induced by the lithium insertion/extraction. Although multimetallic systems still need to be better studied, it is evident that the structural and electrochemical characteristics of composites can be modified.
4. Hydroxide/biomass-derived carbon composites
4.1 Monometallic hydroxide/biomass-derived carbon composites
Transition-metal hydroxides (TMHs) supported on carbons are promising candidates for supercapacitors due to their theoretical capacity, nanostructured morphologies, electrochemical activity and low cost.181 Therefore, the modification of these materials by the employment of biomass-derived carbons is an alternative to improve the capacitive properties of supercapacitors.182 Furthermore, the synergic effect generated by combination of monometallic hydroxides and biomass-derived carbons can open a wide range of alternatives in the design of new materials with novel properties in terms of charge accumulation. In this section, some of these advances are described in terms of the synthesis and characterization of monometallic hydroxides and their potential as supercapacitor electrodes.

4.1.1 Electrodes based on nickel hydroxide/biomass-derived carbons. 
Ni hydroxides have been mainly studied in alkaline electrolytes, since this medium promotes the most evident structural changes between 0.3 and 0.5 V. These changes are associated with the shortening and stiffening of the Ni–O bonds and the increase in the vibrational polarizability of the Ni–O stretching modes.183 Charge/discharge processes can induce changes in the oxidation states of Ni, between the states Ni2+ and Ni3+ or Ni3+ and Ni4+, which have been explained from the breaking/formation of O–H bonds during the redox reactions. Bearing in mind these properties, several authors have designed materials based on Ni hydroxides and biomass-derived carbons. For instance, Nagaraju et al.184 prepared a honeycomb-structured carbon by activation and carbonization of pine cone flowers, in order to employ this material as a support for the deposition of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets.184 These nanosheets fully covered the carbon surface in an intercalated configuration which leads to a hierarchical nanonetwork with enhanced porosity and a specific surface area of 1589 m2 g−1. Because of this structure, this material exhibited a specific capacitance of 916.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, while its capacitance retention was around 89.5% after 2000 cycles in 1 mol L−1 KOH. The authors stated that the porous structure of the composite provided free paths for the diffusion of electrolyte ions, increasing its wettability and favoring the faradaic redox reactions associated with Ni. Rice husk-derived carbon (RH-C) has also been decorated with Ni(OH)2 and employed as a supercapacitor, as reported by Cai et al.185 The as-formed composite generated a specific capacitance of 952 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH, a value that clearly surpasses that of RH-C, besides a capacitance retention of 81.3% after 1000 cycles. From the EIS experiments, low values of resistance (<1.0 Ω) for both electron transfer and solution diffusion were observed, a result attributed to the electrode's porous network enabling ion transport toward the active Ni sites, promoting a pseudocapacitive regime during the charging/discharging process. Carbon microtubes (MC) obtained from the carbonization of willow catkins have been coated with Ni(OH)2, as reported by Li et al.,186 who controllably grew β-Ni(OH)2 nanosheet arrays on the MC external surface. Capillary effects were generated by the mesopores present in the structure of this composite, leading to a specific capacitance of 1568 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH, besides its cycling stability with 84.3% retention after 3000 cycles. The authors attributed this performance to the high conductivity of the CMs, the intimate contact between this support and β-Ni(OH)2 and the abundance of mesopores in the composite, meaning a high surface area for the formation of large electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor employing β-Ni(OH)2/MC as a positive electrode and MC as a negative electrode was built, delivering energy densities in the order of 37.8 W h kg−1 at 750 W kg−1, this being proof of the suitability of both MC and the composite as electrodes for supercapacitors. Galvanic replacement is also an alternative for the deposition of Ni(OH)2 on biomass carbon, as reported by Yu et al.,187 who carbonized a composite of peach gum and magnesium acetate to promote the insertion of Ni(OH)2 by replacing the magnesium in the structure. The authors reported a specific capacity of 166 C g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH, with a retention of 83.9% after 5000 cycles and energy density of 36.9 W h kg−1 at 400 W kg−1. There are also some reports concerning the obtaining of amorphous carbon materials with improved capacitance properties. For instance, sorghum stalk and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were used as precursors to synthesize composites composed of an amorphous carbon (SSBC) supporting well-dispersed Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles prepared by microwave deposition.188 The carbon support did not show traces of crystallinity from the XRD analysis, although it developed a specific capacitance of 890 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH, with 95.9% retention after 30000 cycles. This work suggested that even with a non-crystalline carbon material, it is possible to obtain composites with good performance as supercapacitors, and their efficiency is attributed to the low ion diffusion resistance and the promotion of the electron transfer after the redox process addressed by Ni(OH)2. One step synthesis procedures have also been suggested as an alternative to design materials where Ni(OH)2 is embedded in the carbon material structure. Zhang et al.189 prepared a N-doped carbon material with nickel hydroxide/nickel sulfide (C/N–Ni(OH)2/NixSy) inserted in a sandwich configuration. Egg white was employed as a biomass precursor, which was mixed with Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and ammonia in an autoclave reactor. The result was a material composed of Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes decorated by well-dispersed NixSy nanoparticles, considering the presence of sulfur in the egg protein. One consequence of this structure was that the specific capacitance was higher than 1700 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 1 mol L−1 KOH. Furthermore, this material developed a specific energy of 38.98 W h kg−1 at 404 W kg−1 and exhibited cycling stability with 107% retention after 10000 cycles. The authors attributed the high performance of C/N–Ni(OH)2/NixSy to the nanoparticle/flake sandwich structure, which probably promotes the electrolyte ion migration, as well as the N presence, playing a key role in the electrical conductivity and wettability of the material.
Mesopores play an important role in the capacitance performance of Ni(OH)2 deposited on biomass-derived carbons, as demonstrated by the studies reported in ref. 186, 187 and 189, which registered the highest specific capacitances and mesopore distribution in both the carbon material and nanostructured Ni(OH)2. Fig. 8A shows the SEM image of β-Ni(OH)2@ACMT, where the carbon was synthesized from willow catkins. This composite showed a higher content of mesopores than that of pure Ni(OH)2, as demonstrated from the type IV isotherms and pore size distribution (Fig. 8B and C, respectively), which improved the capacitance properties of this composite, depicted in Fig. 8D. Type IV isotherms (Fig. 8F and G) were also observed for the composites obtained by Mg galvanic replacement previously adsorbed on a peach gum-derived carbon matrix by Ni2+, which was converted to Ni(OH)2 (Fig. 8E). As can be seen in Fig. 8H, the carbon impregnated with a medium content of Mg (Ni(OH)2/CNS-4) displayed the highest specific capacitance at different current densities. Following this trend, C/N–Ni(OH)2/NixSy composites formed from egg white-derived carbon, Ni(OH)2 and NixSy (Fig. 8I) also exhibited higher mesopore content (see Fig. 8J and K) than Ni(OH)2, although in this case, the presence of N and S as dopants in the materials was stated as the reason for the abundance of mesopores. This material required a prolonged time to complete the charge/discharge process as depicted in Fig. 8L, indicating high capacitance for this composite. According to the present review, it is possible to conclude that the deposition of Ni(OH)2 mainly addresses the formation of mesopores, in comparison with the studies reporting the deposition of Ni oxides, where a mixture of isotherms I and IV was observed, thus describing a high content of micropores and leading to lower capacitance values, as can be seen in Table 1. For a further comparison, Tables 5 and 6 report the morphological and Ni hydroxide capacitive properties, respectively.

4.2 Bimetallic hydroxide/biomass-derived carbon composites
At this time, further analysis of Tables 7 and 8 showed that it is possible to highlight similarities and differences not only in comparison to composites containing monometallic and bimetallic hydroxides, but also to bimetallic oxide/biomass-derived carbon composites. For example, similarly to bimetallic oxides, there is a preference for hydroxides containing Ni and Co. On the other hand, the large amount of NiAl-LDHs is an interesting feature of bimetallic hydroxide-based composites.

Thus, Fang et al.57 used biomass-derived carbon as the conductive matrix to support nanostructured NiAl-LDH. For this, electrically conductive carbon fibers (CFs) derived from cotton stalks, which are a common agricultural waste, were prepared by a two-step method (Fig. 9A). According to the authors, the obtained CF@Ni–Al-LDH nanocomposite possesses an intriguing structure (Fig. 9B) that incorporates ultrafine LDH crystalline nanoparticles into the amorphous scaffold (Fig. 9C and D), displaying a great electrochemical performance, i.e. high specific capacitance of 1214.9 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, retaining approximately 75.5% of the capacitance at 10 A g−1, and good cyclability of 528 F g−1 after 1000 cycles at 20 A g−1. Furthermore, an aqueous HSC device using this nanocomposite as the cathode material achieved acceptable specific energy of 20.1 W h kg−1 at 932 W kg−1.57

Even better results were reported by F. Golmohammadi & M. Amiri.190 They reported a cathode material for a supercapacitor based on biomass derived 3D graphene coupled with NiAl-LDH. Typha domingensis, well known in Kermanshah, Iran as Karrapo (KP), was employed as a biomass source. As shown in Fig. 9E, after the freeze-drying and reduction of the composite at 700 °C, the KP acted as a buffer between the graphene oxide (GO) sheets and turned into KP-GO. Next, after a one-step autoclave process the NiAl-LDH@KP-GO was synthesized (Fig. 9F). The results of the NiAl-LDH@KP-GO (Fig. 9H) composite in comparison with bare NiAl-LDH or NiAl-LDH@GO (Fig. 9G) showed a significant improvement in electrochemical performance. The composite demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 1390 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a super rate capability of 60% from 1 to 30 A g−1, as well as cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 92% after 5000 cycles, indicating great potential for supercapacitor applications. Furthermore, an HSC using a NiAl-LDH@KP-GO composite as a positive electrode material and Vulcan XC-72R (VC) as a negative electrode material exhibited a maximum energy density of 173 W h kg−1 and power density of 28.8 kW kg−1 as well as excellent cycling stability with 92% retention after 5000 cycles manifesting the promising application of NiAl-LDHs/biomass-derived carbon composites in energy storage. In fact, the NiAl-LDH@KP-GO//VC HSC presented the best performance among devices based on bimetallic hydroxide/biomass-derived carbon composites.
It is also important to highlight that the better electrochemical performance of the NiAl-LDH@KP-GO composite compared to the CF@NiAl-LDH may be related especially to two factors: (1) a greater specific surface area (∼390 m2 g−1 for the NiAl-LDH@KP-GO and 327.5 m2 g−1 for the CF@NiAl-LDH, Table 7); and (2) possibly the largest quantity of active redox sites per gram of biomass (3 mmol of Ni + Al salts per 40 mg of biomass for the NiAl-LDH@KP-GO composite and 1 mmol of Ni + Al salts per 30 mg of biomass for the CF@NiAl-LDH composite, Table 7).
As mentioned earlier, in addition to composites containing NiAl-LDHs, hydroxides having NiCo are the most studied for energy storage,41,191 and it was no different for composites containing carbon materials derived from biomass. In one of these studies, Lai et al.192 prepared a composite based on nitrogen-doped carbonized bacterial cellulose and nickel–cobalt layered double hydroxide (CBC-N@NiCo-LDH) with hierarchical structures. The composite was obtained via in situ oxidative polymerization, high-temperature carbonization and solution co-deposition processes performed consecutively (Fig. 10A). This CBC-N@LDH composite exhibited an enhanced specific capacitance of 1949.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a high capacitance retention of 54.7% at 10 A g−1, and excellent cycling stability with 74.4% retention after 5000 cycles. According to the authors, the excellent electrochemical properties are due to the uniform dispersion of ultrathin NiCo-LDH nanosheets on the CBC-N nanofiber surface (Fig. 10B), the intimate contact between them, and the highly conductive 3D network consisting of CBC-N nanofibers (Fig. 10C). Furthermore, ASCs with CBC-N@NiCo-LDH composites as positive electrode materials and CBC-N nanofibers as negative electrode materials can be operated in a wide potential window of 0–1.6 V with a high specific energy of 36.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 800.2 W kg−1, demonstrating its potential applications in high-performance energy storage devices. In fact, the CBC-N@NiCo-LDH prepared by Lai et al.192 exhibited higher capacitances than biomass-derived carbon composites containing NiAl-LDHs previously reported,57,190 NiCo@BC193 (NiCo-LDH nanosheets decorated on a biomass carbon skeleton, 606.4 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and Ni–Co DH@APC194 (a Ni–Co DH nanostructure constructed on an apple-derived porous carbon surface, 1519 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1).

Similarly, Ouyang et al.195 developed a composite containing biomass carbon with the highest energy storage capacity among bimetallic hydroxides. In this study, KOH-activated biomass-derived porous carbon (BPC) was synthesized using water caltrops as a carbon source (Fig. 10D). Then, NiCo-LDHs with hierarchically spherical morphology (Fig. 10E and F) were successfully prepared by anchoring NiCo-LDH (self-assembled homogeneous nanosheet) particles on the BPC surface by a solvothermal method. In this study, it was found that the NiCo-LDHs/BPC electrode with a Ni:Co molar ratio of R = 1:0.5 possesses a high specific capacitance of 2047 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 due to the synergistic effect between LDHs and BPC. The NiCo-LDHs/BPC (R = 1:0.5) electrode retains 75% of the specific capacitance with the current density increasing from 1.0 to 20 A g−1, compared with the NiCo-LDH (R = 1:0.5) electrode without adding the BPC (36% of the initial capacity). Furthermore, the HSC based on the NiCo-LDHs/BPC cathode and BPC/PPy anode delivers a high specific energy of 49.0 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 797 W kg−1 and good cycling performance (∼75.8% retention after 6000 cycles). As stated by the authors, the high capacitance arising from the hierarchically structured spherical NiCo-LDHs with more electroactive sites can facilitate electron transportation and electrolyte ion diffusion. In addition, the BPC is an ideal conductive host for direct deposition of homogeneous NiCo-LDHs owing to its high specific surface area and good conductivity, which can reduce the effect of binder on the electrode material capacitance.195
Despite the smaller specific surface area of NiCo-LDHs/BPC (136.6 m2 g−1) when compared to CBC-N@NiCo-LDH reported by Lai et al.192 (405.8 m2 g−1), its high specific capacitance may be related to a higher density of electrochemically active sites, as expected for a material prepared with a higher concentration of NiCo-LDH in relation to the amount of carbon derived from biomass, as shown in Table 7 (0.0750 mmol of Ni + Co/mg of biomass for the NiCo-LDHs/BPC composite and 0.0600 mmol of Ni + Co/mg of biomass for the CBC-N@NiCo-LDH composite), confirming that the proportion of hydroxide and biomass is an important factor in the design of composites for energy storage.
It is also important to mention that the use of biomass-derived carbon as a negative electrode is a very promising alternative in the design of HSCs, especially when associated with other materials such as metal oxides or polymers, as highlighted in the studies by Ouyang et al.195 (Fig. 10G and H) and Lai et al.192
4.3 Trimetallic hydroxide/biomass-derived carbon composites
Despite finding few studies on trimetallic hydroxide/biomass-derived carbon composites, the preparation of trimetallic materials has been reported as a very promising strategy, displaying exceptionally good performances as electrode materials, presenting bright new prospects for the future of hybrid energy storage devices41 or as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction.196
5. Mono-, bi- and trimetallic oxide/hydroxide composites: Quo vadis?
A comparison between the capacitance performances displayed for the composites composed of biomass-derived carbons and monometallic oxides or hydroxides shows that the later developed higher specific capacitances and in general, their electrochemical properties overcome those of the oxides. This comparison can be made from the data reported in Tables 2 and 5, as well as the specific capacitances depicted in Fig. 11A. Notice that all top 5 monometallic hydroxides are based on Ni, which is due to the abundance, cost efficiency, environment friendliness, high theoretical specific capacity202 (usually Ni(OH)2 is erroneously defined as a supercapacitor material, and consequently presents “high theoretical specific capacitance”), and well-defined redox transitions of Ni(OH)2 and due to the synergy between the hydroxides and carbonaceous support, highlighting characteristics such as high mesopore content, uniform distribution of Ni(OH)2 on carbon, ultrathin morphologies of Ni(OH)2 (improving the intimate contact between TMHs and carbon), the behavior of carbon as a collector of long-range conducting current (evidenced in sheet, plate or microtube carbon morphologies), and the eventual presence of heteroatoms such as nitrogen and sulfur in the carbon structure (which come from the biomass source). The argument stated by the authors lies, on the one hand, in the increase in the electrical conductivity of the composite by the presence of the mentioned heteroatoms and, on the other hand, in the presence of mesopores which could enhance the diffusion of the electrolyte toward the active site where the composite works under a pseudocapacitive regime. This fact can be verified from the type IV-isotherms observed for the Ni(OH)2/biomass-derived carbon composites, indicating the formation of structures rich in mesopores, as explained in Section 4.1.1. Thus, it is important to highlight that there are several reasons for the improved specific capacitances developed by TMHs in comparison with those observed for TMOs: (i) in general, TMHs form layered structures with rich mesoporous content and high surface area, which promote the ion migration and intercalation/deintercalation processes;189 (ii) these structures also exhibit higher conductivities than those of TMOs, thus favoring the electron transfer processes;155 (iii) the redox processes associated with metal hydroxides essentially depend on the breaking and formation of O–H bonds, which do not significantly alter the metal hydroxide structures, keeping in this way the abundance of mesopores in the composites.182 Furthermore, it is important to highlight that no abundant reports about the use of other monometallic hydroxides different than those of nickel are reported in the literature, suggesting a wide field of research concerning the design of composites composed of metallic hydroxides and biomass-derived carbons.

Unlike biomass-derived composites containing monometallic oxides/hydroxides, the top 5 electrodes based on bimetallic composites presented relatively high capacitances (Fig. 11B), besides the similar specific capacitances between composites based on bimetallic oxide and hydroxide, indicating that the formation of bimetallic materials is a promising trend in the development of high energy density devices. In fact, it is possible to observe that, on average, the capacitance is approximately twice as high for composites based on bimetallic oxides compared to monometallic ones due to the synergetic effect of two metal cations.40 This latter could be due to redox processes involved in the potential windows. For example, NiCo2O4 based composites show two redox processes: Ni2+ to Ni3+ and Co2+ to Co3+, and for the SnMo–O@P-HPC-700 composite show more redox processes of Mo to Mo4+, Mo4+ to Mo6+ and Sn to Sn4+, obtaining higher specific capacitance than monometallic oxides. In the same way, other characteristics to highlight for composites based on bimetallic oxides are the presence of heteroatoms, a high ratio of micro- and mesopores, uniform distribution and small size of bimetallic oxides particles, intimate contact between oxides and carbon, and the micron-sized morphological carbon which acts as a collector of long-range conducting current. Furthermore, another no less important factor is the influence of low crystallinity in mono- or bimetallic oxides promoting the generation of oxygen vacancy defects that improve the electron/ion transfer kinetics accelerating electrochemical redox processes.
Analogous to composites containing bimetallic oxides, the top 5 composites based on bimetallic hydroxides generally have high specific capacitances, and on average, higher specific capacitances than composites containing monometallic hydroxides. It is also worth noting that 4 of the top 5 materials are based on lamellar NiCo hydroxides, while all 5 electrode materials contain nickel. In fact, the association of nickel hydroxide with other metal ions (such as Co2+/3+ and Al3+) has also been used to improve the electrochemical performance for different applications,203 and the mixed metal hydroxide seems to be a better proposition than single metal hydroxides.204
At this point, it is also important to note that the top five composites and those throughout the review contain biomass-derived carbons primarily from plants and fruits presenting high lignin content increasing their carbon yield. Furthermore, for biomass carbonization, usually KOH is used as a chemical activator, but in some cases, it is not necessary because the components within the biomass can act as activators, requiring only a pyrolysis process later. All of this gives more added value to the raw material. On the other hand, the performance of the composites to be used as supercapacitors also depends highly on the metallic component. According to Fig. 11, monometallic hydroxides show specific capacitances similar to bimetallic oxides and hydroxides, but with the use of cobalt in bimetallic composites. This can be a disadvantage considering that the price of Co is higher compared to that of Ni, Mn or Fe precursors.205,206 In light of all that has been mentioned, the use of monometallic hydroxides and bimetallic materials, with low cobalt content, supported on biomass-derived carbon from plant or fruit biomass is promising, highlighting a relatively simple route of synthesis, lower production costs and high specific capacitances.
It should also be mentioned that despite the small number of studies reporting the use of composites combining trimetallic TMOs/TMHs and derived-carbon biomass, it is possible to visualize trends and highlight prospects, since many studies have already investigated the use of these TMOs/TMHs associated with other carbonaceous materials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes.41
6. Conclusions and outlook
From the studies presented in this review, some conclusions can be drawn:
The use of biomass as a carbon precursor is very interesting due to its high abundance, availability and low acquisition costs. It gives agricultural waste an opportunity to give added value to some products in different parts of the world, as well as facilitating a comprehensive management of solid waste from the agricultural sector. There are different types of agricultural waste that can be explored such as banana peel, pistachio peel, walnut peel, pecan peel, peanut peel, and so on. Biomass-derived carbon materials have been considered very efficient materials for energy storage applications due to their physicochemical properties such as large surface area, good pore size distribution, and electrical conductivity resulting in good capacitance and stability over numerous successive charge/discharge cycles. An equilibrated content of both micropores and mesopores on the biomass-derived carbon structure is a crucial factor in the obtaining of materials with suitable properties to be employed as supercapacitors. The activation step during the synthesis procedures plays a key role in the tuning of these micro- and mesopores. Micropores guarantee a high surface area in the composite and mesopores enhance the ion diffusion toward the active sites where the capacitor acts in the pseudocapacitance regime. Also, the different morphologies at the microscale are important to provide long-range conductivity; in some studies, to guarantee it, other components such as metal oxides/hydroxides or carbonaceous materials (manly graphene or graphene oxide) can be very helpful. Likewise, the usual presence of heteroatoms in biomass-derived carbon such as N and S can modify the carbon structure, increasing its electrical conductivity.
As mentioned before, through the design of hybrid or composite materials from biomass-derived carbon and the introduction of electroactive metal oxides or hydroxides, it is possible to develop new materials with a synergistic behavior, which facilitate the exploitation of the useful properties of each component, leading to a better accumulation of charge of the composite material. The addition of PC or B-t to EDLC materials is an attractive option to improve the storage properties of the electrode material. In general, low loadings of the monometallic TMOs/TMHs supported on biomass-derived carbon are enough to obtain high performance in terms of specific capacitances (or specific charge) and stabilities, although the composites developing higher capacitance contained a relatively high content of the metal component. This fact is particularly evident in the case of the bi- and trimetallic hydroxide/biomass-derived carbon-based composites, which displayed high capacitance performances with high loading of the bimetallic hydroxides. Thus, the relationship between metal charge and biomass carbon is a very important and easily tunable parameter that provides important characteristics of a composite such as its metallic component distribution, particle size, conductivity, surface area and pore distribution.
According to the information displayed in Tables 2 and 6, it is evident that the monometallic hydroxides developed higher specific capacitances than those of the monometallic oxides (Fig. 11A). The most plausible reason explaining these advanced performances was related to the high content of mesopores in the composites composed of biomass-derived carbons and the hydroxides. However, despite the good performances presented by the monometallic hydroxides, their rate retention capabilities are in general lower than those of the monometallic oxides. Nevertheless, both monometallic oxides and hydroxides are able to keep their specific capacitance values after several operation cycles, as can be inferred from their cycling stability.
Mainly for TMOs it was evidenced that the presence of bimetallic composites improves the specific capacitance due to the number of redox processes in the potential window, and the presence of bi- and trimetallic composites can also improve other properties such as conductivity, stability, surface area and porosity. In relation to composites containing bimetallic hydroxides, the use of NiAl-LDHs, and especially NiCo-LDHs, has been widely reported. In fact, biomass-derived carbon composites combined with NiCo-LDHs presented the highest capacitances, demonstrating great viability as positive electrodes for HSCs. It is also important to highlight that the better electrochemical performance of the best NiAl-LDH/ and NiCo-LDH/biomass-derived carbon composites may be related especially to two factors: (1) a greater specific surface area (with the structure usually containing mesopores) and/or (2) the largest amount of active redox sites per gram of biomass-derived carbon.
As demonstrated in this review, the utilization of biomass-derived carbon composites combined with TMOs/TMHs is promising as a new concept for energy storage technologies and there is a lot of research to be done. As a perspective for future research, biomass-derived carbon supported monometallic hydroxides based on transition metals different than nickel deserve wide exploration (only nickel has been exploited as a metal alternative to design these composites), with a search for materials with properties allowing the generation of high specific charge/capacitances, energy densities and power densities with long-term stability and low cost. Alternatively, metal oxide or hydroxide/biomass-derived carbon composites are excellent candidates to be used in other energy storage devices, for example, as cathodes for polymer electrolyte fuel cells, where metal oxides/hydroxides present high stability and activity against the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) when they are supported on biomass-derived carbons. The kinetic limitations that these types of device present decrease due to the carbon porosity improving the mass transport to the active sites; likewise, the design of platinum-free electrodes is a strategy to reduce costs. In addition, these composites can be used as cathodes in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The biggest limitation in battery technology development is finding materials that can reversibly intercalate sodium ions (SIBs) or lithium ions (LIBs). Thus, metal oxides/hydroxides are interesting materials since they present a simple structure, can reversibly intercalate ions, are easy to synthesize, present high operating potentials, and can be easily scaled and commercialized.
In addition, recent advancements in biomass-derived carbon materials chemistry and its applications are opening new unexplored prospects for the design and preparation of materials by simple synthetic protocols for the fabrication of low-cost devices. Thus, the use of reagentless laser-based techniques in the synthesis and improvement of electrode materials207–209 is a promising alternative to the expensive and time-consuming step of activation treatment for preparation of biomass-derived carbon materials, especially considering the future large-scale production of affordable energy electrode materials.
