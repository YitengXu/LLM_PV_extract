    , Accepted 28th October 2015First published on 28th October 2015AbstractA new 1,8-naphthalimide based planar small molecular acceptor and two benzothiadiazole based wide band gap (WBG) polymer donors P1 and P2 were synthesized for nonfullerene organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). Devices based on fluorinated polymer P2 achieved a highly improved PCE of 3.71% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.07 V, which is beyond the currently known levels for nonfullerene OPVs with the Voc higher than 1 V.
Bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells (BHJ OPVs) with a conjugated polymer or a small molecule as the donor and (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor have attracted tremendous attention in the past few years because of their advantages of low cost, light weight and mechanical flexibility.1,2 Driven by the synthesis of new donor materials and the optimization of device structure, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10% for single junction OPVs has been achieved.3,4 Among all donor polymers, wide band gap (WBG) polymers usually exhibit a high molar absorption coefficient in the range from 350 nm to 650 nm. Single junction OPVs based on WBG polymers have achieved a PCE of 9%.5 Moreover, by associating wide and narrow band gap polymers together to fabricate a tandem device, PCEs of over 11% have been reported.6,7 Although a rapid development has been made for WBG polymers, the highest PCE value of WBG polymer based devices is still inferior to that of narrow band gap polymer based devices. The high lying LUMO level (around −3.4 eV) of WBG polymers hampers the further improvement of their PCE. When blended with PC71BM to fabricate a device, the offset between the LUMO levels of donor materials and PC71BM (−4.04 eV) is too large, which will induce a significant energy loss.5,8
Nonfullerene small molecular acceptors, which exhibit a high molar absorption coefficient in the visible range and possess an easily tuned LUMO level, have the potential to further improve the PCE of WBG polymer based devices.9,10 In the last few years, nonfullerene acceptors were extensively pursued and PCEs over 7% have been achieved.11,12 The electron mobility of a nonfullerene acceptor is usually inferior to that of fullerene. The usual strategy to increase it is to introduce a strong electron withdrawing group such as perylene diimide (PDI) as the acceptor unit;13 another one is to conjugate two or more electron withdrawing groups like the cyano group.14 However, both of the strategies will significantly down-shift the LUMO level of the acceptor and produce a low-lying LUMO level. Like PC71BM, most high efficiency nonfullerene acceptors such as PDI derivatives possess a low lying LUMO level at around −3.9 eV, which is not compatible with WBG donor materials.15 Rhodamine or 1,8-naphthalimide (NI) based small molecular acceptors have a high lying LUMO level, which will reduce the energy loss and produce a high open circuit voltage (Voc).16,17 When blending with WBG donor materials, a higher PCE can be expected.
Compared with common bridge units such as thiophene or selenophene groups, the alkyne group also exhibits a good electron transporting ability.18,19 Besides, using an alkyne group as the bridge could lead to a free internal rotation of two conjugated planes, which might be beneficial for the packing of acceptor units. Although nonfullerene acceptors have been widely studied, it is still a challenge to investigate the relationship between chemical structure and photovoltaic performance. Recent research has revealed that significantly enhanced PCE could be obtained by using fluorinated polymers as the donor in PC71BM based OPVs;3 however, whether they will play a positive effect for nonfullerene OPVs is yet to be answered.
In this communication, two WBG polymer donors (P1, P2) and a novel small molecular acceptor (NI-AA-NI) with two NI bridged by a diacetylene group were synthesized. For the first time, the influence of fluoro-substitution on donor materials for the performance of nonfullerene organic solar cells was investigated. Our investigation has demonstrated that photovoltaic devices using the fluorinated polymer P2 as the donor and NI-AA-NI as the acceptor showed a PCE of 3.71% with a Voc up to 1.07 V. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE for nonfullerene OPVs with a Voc higher than 1 V.
The syntheses of P1, P2, NI-AA-NI and intermediates are shown in Scheme S1.1 (refer to the ESI†) and detailed characterizations are also provided in the ESI.†NI-AA-NI exhibits good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CHCl3), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at room temperature. P1 and P2 are not soluble in common solvents at room temperature, but can be fully dissolved in DCB at 80 °C. The weight average molecular weights of P1 and P2 were determined to be 50.3 kg mol−1 and 119.1 kg mol−1, respectively, by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 80 °C using chlorobenzene (CB) as an eluent and narrowly distributed polystyrenes as calibration standards. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that P1, P2 and NI-AA-NI possess good thermal stability (Fig. S1, ESI†). A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) test showed good crystallinity with a melting peak at 216.0 °C and a crystallization peak at 201.4 °C for NI-AA-NI (Fig. S2, ESI†), but no obvious crystallization peak or transition could be detected for P1 and P2, indicating that both polymers could be amorphous. Besides that, the crystallinity of NI-AA-NI could also be confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. S3, ESI†).
To shed light on the optimized geometry of NI-AA-NI, a computational study was carried out by using the density functional theory (DFT) method (B3LYP/6-31G(d)). For simplicity, octyl chains were replaced by methyl groups (for details refer to Table S1, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2, NI-AA-NI presents a planar molecular structure with an interfacial angle of 0.31° between two NI rings. The planar structure of NI-AA-NI is beneficial for its close packing in the solid state.20
UV-vis absorption spectra of P1, P2 and NI-AA-NI were measured in dilute DCB solutions (1 × 10−5 M) at 100 °C and as films (Fig. 1). In solution, P1 and P2 showed two similar absorption peaks with a molar extinction coefficient of 7.1 × 104 and 1.03 × 105 M−1 cm−1, which could be ascribed to the localized π–π* transition and internal charge transportation from the carbazole donor unit to the benzothiadiazole acceptor unit, respectively. Comparing with polymer donors, NI-AA-NI exhibited a narrower absorption spectrum with a molar extinction coefficient of 1.32 × 105 M−1 cm−1 in solution. In going from solution to films, the absorption band of P1 and P2 obviously red shifted, indicating that both polymers exhibited better packing properties as films. Whereas, NI-AA-NI as a film exhibited a broader absorption with the main absorption peak blue-shifted obviously from 397 nm in solution to 376 nm as a film, indicating that NI-AA-NI probably formed H-aggregates in the solid state.17 Determined from the onset absorption of films, the band gap of P1, P2 and NI-AA-NI was calculated to be 1.97, 1.95 and 2.43 eV, respectively. Related data are summarized in Table 1.

The electrochemical properties of P1, P2 and NI-AA-NI were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV, for details refer to S1.2, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. S4 (ESI†), the HOMO levels of P1 and P2 were determined to be −5.23 and −5.28 eV, respectively. The presence of one F atom on the polymer backbone slightly downshifted the HOMO level of P1. Using the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,opt, LUMO levels of P1 and P2 were calculated to be −3.26 and −3.33 eV, respectively. Similarly, the HOMO and the LUMO levels of NI-AA-NI were determined to be −6.00 and −3.57 eV, respectively. It is worth pointing out that the LUMO level calculated for Eg,opt is close to that determined from the CV curve (−3.56 eV). In comparison with PC71BM (−4.04 eV), NI-AA-NI exhibited a high-lying LUMO level (−3.57 eV), which would reduce the energy loss when blended with donor polymers with a high LUMO level. As a result, the low-lying HOMO levels of P1 and P2 and the high-lying LUMO level of NI-AA-NI would result in a high Voc for nonfullerene OPVs.21 These data are also summarized in Table 1.
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of NI-AA-NI as the acceptor and WBG polymers as the donor, conventional devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:NI-AA-NI/LiF/Al were fabricated (Fig. 3, for details refer to S1.2, ESI†). After optimization, both P1 and P2 based devices exhibited the best photovoltaic performance with a donor–acceptor ratio of 1:3 and a thickness of around 50 nm. P1 based as prepared devices showed a PCE of 1.26% with a Voc of 1.06 V. Comparably, devices based on P2 exhibited a better photovoltaic performance and a PCE of 2.91% with a Voc of 1.08 V was achieved. By attaching one fluorine atom on the backbone, the LUMO level and the HOMO level of P2 downshifted slightly, which would lead to a smaller energy loss and an increase of Voc (1.06 to 1.08 eV). More importantly, in comparison with the nonfluorinated P1, fluorinated P2 also exhibited a great enhancement of short circuit current (Jsc, from 3.40 to 5.27 mA cm−2) and fill factor (FF, from 0.35 to 0.51), which was similar to that shown by PC71BM based devices.22 By taking the widely used 1-chloronaphthalene (1-CN, 0.5%) as the additive, PCE values were both obviously improved for devices based on P1 and P2. Specifically, all devices with or without 1-CN exhibited a Voc value higher than 1.06 V, which is better than most PC71BM based devices, demonstrating that the energy loss caused by the offset between the LUMO levels of the donor and the acceptor could be significantly reduced using NI-AA-NI as the acceptor. Especially, a PCE of 3.71% with a Voc of 1.07 V was achieved for P2 based devices, which is the highest PCE with a Voc higher than 1 V for nonfullerene OPVs as we know. The molar extinction coefficients of P1, P2 and NI-AA-NI were all very high, which is beneficial for achieving high Jsc in devices. But being ascribed to the very thin active layer (50 nm), the Jsc of devices was relatively low, which led to the inferior PCE of devices. Furthermore, PCEs of devices based on polymer:PC71BM, and polymer:NI-AA-NI were periodically tested for 7 days to gauge the influence of heat and light on the degradation of devices. All devices were fabricated with a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:3 and using 0.5% 1-CN as the processing additive. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM based devices still retained 86% and 82% PCE values after 7 days. For P1:NI-AA-NI and P2:NI-AA-NI based devices, 89% and 84% PCE values retained after 7 days, demonstrating that devices based on PC71BM or NI-AA-NI all exhibited good stability. These results also revealed that devices based on NI-AA-NI exhibited better device stability than that based on PC71BM (Table 2).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices with and without 1-CN was measured to examine the veracity of Jsc. As shown in Fig. 2b, all devices exhibited a broad spectrum response from 350 nm to 650 nm with a maximum EQE value at around 400 nm, demonstrating that both polymer donors and NI-AA-NI acceptor absorbed photons to generate excitons. Jsc values calculated from integrated EQE curves agreed roughly with that obtained from J–V measurements.
The charge transport properties play an important role in achieving high Jsc and FF. High hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) usually lead to high Jsc.12 In addition, a more balanced hole and electron mobility is beneficial for obtaining high FF.23 To investigate the influence of fluorine substitution on the polymer backbone and 1-CN as the additive on the charge mobility of devices, the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method was utilized to evaluate the μh and μe by fabricating hole-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:NI-AA-NI/Au and electron-only devices with a structure of FTO/polymer:NI-AA-NI/Al. (For details refer to S1.3, ESI.†) Hole mobilities of P1:NI-AA-NI and P2:NI-AA-NI based as prepared devices were calculated to be 6.94 × 10−7, and 2.00 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. (Fig. S6, ESI†) Similarly, electron mobilities of devices as fabricated based on P1 and P2 were ascertained to be 3.34 × 10−8, and 1.25 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 respectively. Devices based on fluorinated P2 exhibited higher hole and electron mobilities, demonstrating that fluorinated polymer donor could enhance the charge transporting properties of NI-AA-NI based nonfullerene OPVs. After using 0.5% 1-CN as the additive, hole mobilities of P1 and P2 based devices were increased to 1.02 × 10−6, and 3.41 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively; electron mobilities of P1 and P2 based devices were also enhanced to 6.51 × 10−7, and 2.41 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Compared to amorphous P1 and P2, the packing properties of planar and crystalline acceptor NI-AA-NI were superior, which induced the electron mobility increasing to a larger extent than that of the hole mobility after optimization with 1-CN. The significant improvement of μe led to a more balanced hole and electron mobilities for the active layers, which would improve the Jsc and FF of P1-2 based devices.
The morphology of the active layer has a great influence on the photovoltaic performance of OPVs. To investigate the morphology of polymer:NI-AA-NI blend films with and without 1-CN, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), P1 based as prepared devices showed a relatively smooth surface, indicating phase separation is mostly in small dimensions.24 After using 0.5% 1-CN, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the P1:NI-AA-NI active layer obviously increased from 1.62 nm to 2.75 nm. This could be ascribed to the enhanced aggregation of P1 and NI-AA-NI,25 which was beneficial for the hole and electron transport in the active layer.17 With 0.5% 1-CN as the additive, the RMS roughness of fluorinated P2 based devices further increased from 4.78 nm to 8.94 nm. This indicated the aggregation of P2 and NI-AA-NI was further enhanced, which would lead to higher Jsc values.
In summary, two WBG polymers (P1, P2) were synthesized as the donor; meanwhile, a new planar small molecular acceptor with two NI as the terminal groups and a diacetylene group as the bridge was also synthesized as the acceptor. NI-AA-NI is crystalline and fully soluble in common solvents. In comparison with PC71BM, NI-AA-NI exhibits a higher-lying LUMO level which will reduce the offset of LUMO levels between donor and acceptor. By attaching a fluorine atom on the backbone, the LUMO and HOMO levels of P2 both decreased which could further reduce the energy loss and increase Voc. Owing to the boosted electron mobility, more balanced hole and electron mobility was achieved in P2:NI-AA-NI based OPVs. Consequently, higher Jsc and FF were achieved. Finally, a PCE of 3.71% with a Voc of 1.07 V was obtained, which is the best for nonfullerene OPVs with a Voc higher than 1 V as we know. These results also show that the use of fluorinated polymers as the donor material is an effective strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance of nonfullerene OPVs. Although the performance of NI-AA-NI based nonfullerene OPVs was not very intriguing at the moment, the achievement of a PCE higher than that of WBG polymer:PC71BM based devices could be extremely expected by the optimization of other parameters.
