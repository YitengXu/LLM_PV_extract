1. Introduction
In the effort of developing a new-generation organic photovoltaic (PV) cells, organic bulk-heterojunctions (OBHs) and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have become an interesting component with unique facile property-tuning features. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of both OBHs and DSSCs are largely behind the silicon-based PVs due to still limited optical absorption and lower carrier mobility. As a result, new-generation solar cells with higher PCEs have been pursued for the past decades. Recently, organo-metal halide perovskites have become extremely attractive photovoltaic materials to develop new-generation solar cells. Here, we refer organo-metal halide perovskites to perovskites. In 2009, the first perovskite solar cell with a PCE of 3.81% was reported by Miyasaka et al.1 Two years later, Park et al. further enhanced the PCE to 6.5%.2 Until 2012, high-efficiency perovskite solar cells were demonstrated by Snaith et al. with the PCE reaching 10.9%.3 During the past three years, the PCEs of perovskite solar cells have shown an amazing growth from 10.9% to 20.1%.4 Clearly, the perovskites provide a unique platform to explore new-generation photovoltaic systems with superior device performance.
In general, organo-metal halide perovskites can be described by chemical formula ABX3, where the A, B and X sites are occupied by an organic cation, metal cation and halide anion, respectively (Fig. 1). The organic and inorganic components are responsible for ferroelectric and semiconducting properties, respectively. We should note that methylammonium lead trihalide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br or I) have shown great merits for PV application among other members in the perovskites family.5–9 In addition, the diverse choices of either organic cation or halide anion enables development of a series of perovskites for enhancing PV actions,10–12 light emission,13–16 lasing actions,17–19 and spintronics.20 With the concern of the toxicity of lead, lead-free perovskites have been developed, such as tin halide perovskites.21–26

Recently, PCEs of perovskite solar cells have been quickly increased from 3% up to 20.1% through materials processing and device engineering efforts.1–5 However, the fundamental physics involved in internal photovoltaic processes still demand further investigations to gain in-depth understanding toward further advancement in light-electricity conversion efficiencies. In general, the perovskites can demonstrate remarkable long-range ambipolar charge transport characteristics,27 high dielectric constants,28,29 low exciton binding energies,30,31 intrinsic ferroelectric polarizations,32,33 and spin-dependent responses.34,35 Clearly, these intrinsic photophysics and spinphysics properties indicate that perovskites are the most promising candidates for developing the next-generation PV cells.
In this review article, we focus on the fundamental photophysics and spinphysics involved in perovskite solar cells. In Section 2, we summarize the key parameters and effective methods that control and enable further improvements to charge transport properties. First, the long-range ambipolar transport properties are discussed. Second, several methods are reviewed for further improving transport properties, including sophisticated chloride doping, morphological development, electrode interface engineering, and single crystal growth. In Section 3, we review the recent studies on the formation processes of photoexcited states towards in-depth understanding on the photophysics behind perovskite PV cells. In particular, excitation-intensity dependent and excitation-wavelength dependent branching ratios between free charge carriers and excitons are discussed. In Section 4, we discuss the key parameters that are related to exciton binding energies in perovskite solar cells. In this section, we review three approaches from recent experimental studies in controlling the exciton binding energies in perovskite solar cells. In Section 5, we summarize both the theoretical and experimental studies on the ferroelectric properties in perovskites. In particular, the discussion focuses on recent studies of ferroelectric properties in developing photovoltaic actions under device-operating conditions. In Section 6, the spinphysics are reviewed for perovskites. We discuss a recently observed new phenomena: magnetic field effects (MFEs). The purpose is to use the MFEs as a new experimental method to reveal internal useful and non-useful photovoltaic processes in perovskite solar cells.
2. Superior charge transport properties
To date, methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) and its mixed iodide-chloride analogue (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) are considered as most promising candidates for developing high-efficiency PV cells.36–41 They have demonstrated superior charge transport properties with ambipolar characteristics. In addition, recent studies have shown that charge transport properties can be further improved through sophisticated chloride doping, morphological development, electrode-interface engineering, and single crystal growth.
2.1 Long-range ambipolar charge transport

Ambipolar charge transport. 
It has been found that perovskites have well-balanced electron and hole transports, namely ambipolar transport properties, based on experimental studies from time of flight (ToF),42,43 electron beam induced current (EBIC),44 and thin film transistors (TFTs)27 measurements. It is known that most semiconductors often have unbalanced transport properties between electrons and holes with different effective masses (m*e and m*h). However, the first principle calculation indicates that the electron effective mass (m*e = 0.23m0) is considerably balanced with hole effective mass (m*h = 0.29m0) in perovskites.45 This can result in greatly balanced ambipolar transport properties.46 Balanced ambipolar transport can affect bulk polarization during charge transport and collection, consequently changing short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) in perovskite solar cells. Therefore, ambipolar charge transport is an important parameter in developing high-efficiency PV materials. It should be noted that perovskites can demonstrate dual n-type and p-type properties used in thin-film devices with different interfacial layers.27 It is still a challenging issue to in situ characterize ambipolar transport properties in thin-film perovskite solar cells under device-operating conditions.


Long carrier diffusion lengths. 
Long carrier diffusion lengths were demonstrated in solution processed polycrystalline CH3NH3PbI3 (∼100 nm) and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (∼1 μm).46,47 These values are dramatically larger than the diffusion lengths in organic semiconductors (∼10 nm).47 Normally, short diffusion lengths can cause severe charge recombination and less charge collection, leading to poor photovoltaic actions. It is known that the diffusion length (LD) is essentially determined by the carrier lifetime (τ) and mobility (μ) according to , where kB, T and e are the Boltzman constant, temperature and elementary charge, respectively. All of these parameters are sensitive to crystallinity, domain size, and defects in the perovskites.


Predominant p-type character in CH3NH3PbI3. 
Although perovskites present ambipolar transport characteristics, CH3NH3PbI3 can function as a hole-transporting material towards developing hole-conductor free solar cells. Etgar et al. reported for the first time that a hole-conductor free Au/CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2 heterojunction solar cell exhibits a PCE of 5.5%.48 Later on, Laban et al. observed a depletion area between CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2, forming a “p–n” like junction, as shown in Fig. 2.49 Clearly, CH3NH3PbI3 can show p-type behavior due to energy alignment and majority carriers of holes when the TiO2 interfacial layer is used. Furthermore, Heo et al.27 measured the transport properties of CH3NH3PbI3 based on TFT devices. They confirmed ambipolar characteristics with a predominantly p-type behavior in CH3NH3PbI3.

2.2 Sophisticated chlorine doping effects
Recent studies have revealed that the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx have longer diffusion lengths as compared to the CH3NH3PbI3.50,51 This feature allows thicker CH3NH3PbI3−xClx layers but thinner CH3NH3PbI3 layers to fabricate planar heterojunction solar cells. However, it is found that the introduction of chloride ions does not change crystalline structures as well as band structures. Here, we should note that the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx precursor solution is typically prepared by blending CH3NH3I and PbCl2 with a molar ratio of 3:1. Surprisingly, only a small amount of chloride ions (<5%) can remain in the solution-processed thin film. By using angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory modeling, Colella, et al. have shown that the small amount of chloride ions is preferentially located in close proximity to the perovskite/TiO2 interface.52 It is further found that no chloride ions can be detected in the perovskite crystals.53,54 As a result, deeper efforts are needed to explore key functions of chloride ions in perovskite solar cells.

Predominant n-type character in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. 
Lee et al.3 reported that photovoltaic performance in the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx based solar cells can be improved by replacing mesoporous TiO2 with insulating Al2O3, which indicates that electron transport can be faster through the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx itself than mesoporous TiO2. Clearly, CH3NH3PbI3−xClx can function as an n-type semiconductor. Meanwhile, You et al.55 observed that the energy difference between the Fermi level and the valence band edge is about 1.1 eV as compared to the bandgap of 1.5 eV in the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. This finding confirms that CH3NH3PbI3−xClx can act as an n-type semiconductor.


Improved crystallization in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx. 
Recent studies indicated that introduced chloride ions can modify the crystallization process for increasing crystallinity, improving film coverage, and enlarging domain size. Yu et al.51 showed that chloride ions can reduce the density of CH3NH3+ by removing the by-product (CH3NH3Cl) during formation of perovskite polycrystals. The reduced CH3NH3+ can lead to a higher order of crystallinity. More recently, Tidhar et al.56 revealed that adding inactive PbCl2 in a perovskite precursor solution forms heterogeneous nanocrystals which act as a nucleation center to develop perovskite crystals in solution. Thermal annealing can be used to remove residual CH3NH3Cl in perovskite crystals, which can coalesce the dispersed perovskite crystals to form larger grain size and well orientated crystalline domains. Williams et al.57 demonstrated that chloride ions can enhance the formation rate of a CH3NH3PbCl3 intermediate product. Here, this intermediate product can work as a nucleation template to grow larger-size polycrystalline domains, and hence lead to better surface coverage and higher photovoltaic performance. Clearly, the high crystallinity, larger domains, and better film quality induced by chloride ions can lead to strong light absorption and charge transport towards generating high PCEs in perovskite solar cells.

2.3 Morphological development
Morphological structures can be conveniently tuned by controlling materials processing conditions.40,58 In general, the morphological structures, such as crystalline shape, grain sizes, grain boundaries and surface areas, can dramatically affect charge recombination, transport, and collection in bulk perovskites during the development of photovoltaic actions.

Grain size effects. 
CH3NH3PbI3 is likely to form cuboid polycrystals through either two-step solution processing or a vapor deposition method.59–61 It is found that photovoltaic performance significantly relies on crystalline grain sizes.60,62 Xiao et al.62 demonstrated that the carrier diffusion length can be increased to 1 micrometer through solvent annealing, which enlarges the size of cuboids from 260 nm to 1 micrometer (Fig. 3a–c). Also, Nie et al.63 demonstrated a solution-based hot-casting technique to grow continuous and pinhole-free thin films of perovskites with millimeter-scale crystalline grains, which show a PCE of 18%. Fig. 3d and e illustrate that photovoltaic performance can be enhanced by increasing the grain size. This is essentially correlated with improved charge carrier mobility.

Low dimension effects. 
Recently, Im et al.60 prepared CH3NH3PbI3 nanowires-based solar cells with the best PCE of 14.71% by using a modified two-step spin coating method (Fig. 4a–d). Meanwhile, they demonstrated that in-plane low-dimensional nanowires can exhibit better transport properties than three-dimensional (3D) nanocuboid polycrystals (Fig. 4e). It is noted that the carrier transport in 3D perovskite thin films may be limited by random walks through grain boundaries in nano-crystalline systems.64

2.4 Electrode interface engineering
Photovoltaic action in perovskite solar cells heavily relies on electrode interfaces which are controlled by an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL). In general, the electrode interlayers can largely affect the charge transport through a built-in field required to drift photogenerated carriers under device-operating conditions. You et al.55 studied the electrode-interface effects on charge transport properties in polycrystalline CH3NH3PbI3−xClx by using steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL). They observed significant quenching on both PL intensity and PL lifetime when the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx layer is in contact with either the PEDOT:PSS or the PCBM layers (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the electrode interlayer can affect bulk dissociation and recombination through a built-in field that drives the photogenerated carriers to the respective electrodes. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the ambipolar charge transport characteristics allow perovskites to act as both n- and p-type conductors, depending on the type of junction formed with the neighboring semiconductor.27 Therefore, the charge carriers can be transferred at both the ETL/perovskites and perovskites/HTL interfaces.

2.5 Single crystal growth
In general, perovskites can be prepared in polycrystalline and single-crystalline forms. Polycrystalline perovskite films inevitably exist with defects. There are two main types of defects: (i) point defects, exist with intrinsic doping to determine the n- or p-type characters and (ii) grain boundaries, which act as trap states or recombination centers. Normally, the trap states are too shallow to create in-gap states.65,66 Therefore, trap-assisted recombination due to in-gap deep states can be extremely suppressed in perovskite films. Perovskite single crystals have demonstrated interesting optic and electric properties with trap-free high quality films (Fig. 6a and b).42,43,67 As shown in Fig. 6c, CH3NH3PbI3 single crystals present a sharp band-edge absorption and narrow PL spectrum with respect to polycrystalline thin films. This indicates that the single crystals possess exceptionally low trap-state densities, which are on the order of 1010 cm3 (Fig. 6d). Most importantly, the extremely low trap-states enable crystal growth with much higher long-range structural ordering, and hence dramatically improving the carrier mobility. Shi42 and Dong43 reported extremely long diffusion lengths up to 10 micrometers and 175 micrometers in large-size crystals, respectively. Moreover, Dong et al. also demonstrated that the long diffusion lengths enable use of CH3NH3PbI3 in radiation sensing devices through gammavoltaic effect with an efficiency of 3.9% measured with an intense cesium-137 source. These findings pave the way for extending the applications of perovskite single crystals to other optoelectronic devices in the future.

3. Dual photoexcited states: carriers versus excitons
Photoexcited states in organo-metal halide perovskites have been significantly studied since 1990s. Hirasawa, et al. demonstrated that the photoexcited states are Wannier-type excitons with large radii.30 These Wannier-type excitons have low binding energies ranging from 20 meV to 98 meV.30,31,39,68,69 In contrast, Frenkel excitons in organic semiconductors have much higher binding energies (>100 meV). Clearly, the low binding energies can lead to a large amount of free charge carriers through quick dissociation at room temperature. However, recent studies have observed the presence of excitons (or electron–hole pairs) in perovskite materials and perovskite solar cells.34,35,70,71 These findings raise an open question on the branching ratio between free charge carriers and excitons that determines the photovoltaic performance.
Theoretically, a photoexcitation can excite the electrons from a valence band to the conduction band, forming conduction electrons when the photon energy exceeds the bandgap in semiconductors. The conduction electrons can undergo two processes: (i) transport towards generating free charge carriers driven by a built-in field and (ii) relaxation towards forming excitons through a multiphoton process. As a consequence, the carrier/exciton ratio can be largely affected by changing the built-in field and multiphoton process. Nevertheless, controlling the carrier/exciton ratio is a key procedure to improve photovoltaic and light-emitting properties in perovskite films.
3.1 Excitation intensity-dependent carrier/excitons ratio
D'Innocenzo et al.39 studied the carrier/exciton ratio (nfc/nex) as a function of excitation intensity in CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (Eb ≈ 55 ± 20 meV) by combining temperature-dependent absorption with theoretical modeling based on the Saha–Langmuir equation. As shown in Fig. 7, the modeling based on the law of mass action for Wannier–Mott excitons suggests that free charge carriers are predominate (nfc/n ≈ 1) in perovskite solar cells at room temperature. This is because the perovskite solar cells possess large built-in fields which can effectively drift photogenerated carriers to respective electrodes to avoid charge recombination after quick dissociation of photogenerated excitons. Moreover, D'Innocenzo et al. demonstrated that further increasing photoexcitation density (n ∼ 1021 cm−3) enables the formation of excitons and consequently decreases the carrier/excitons ratio (nfc/n ≪ 1). However, it is still unclear whether the excitons are directly generated after light absorption or recombined from electron–hole pairs during charge recombination. Nevertheless, the formation of excitons at high excitation intensities poses a serious challenge to develop concentrated perovskite solar cells.

3.2 Excitation wavelength-dependent carrier/exciton ratio
CH3NH3PbI3 presents a broad absorption spectrum from the ultraviolet regime to the near infrared regime. Therefore, the wavelength-dependent carrier/exciton ratio becomes a critical issue in developing photovoltaic actions. Sheng et al.70 studied the carrier/excitons ratio (nfc/nex) in CH3NH3PbI3 films with both above-gap excitation and below-gap excitation through polarized pump-probe photomodulation (PM) spectroscopy. They detected both free charge carriers (PB and PA2, ∼1.65 eV) and excitons (PA1, 0.8 eV) with above-gap excitation (400 nm) (Fig. 8a). Those two species are found to present remarkably different dynamics (Fig. 8b): excitons (PA1) are generated instantaneously, whereas PB generation is delayed for ∼1 ps. Furthermore, they found that only PB and PA2 bands (∼1.65 eV) can be detected when the below-gap excitation (800 nm) is applied, which indicates exciton generation is negligible in this situation.

3.3 Coulomb-correlated electron–hole pairs
Whether photoexcited states can be considered as charge-neutral excitons or ionized electron–hole pairs in ferroelectrically semiconducting perovskites where both organic and inorganic components co-exist has been an issue. Addressing this critical issue is important for developing photovoltaic, light-emitting, and lasing devices. Saba et al.71 observed that a photoexcitation can generate conducting plasma under different excitation intensities in perovskites. This experimental observation indicates that photogenerated electrons and holes can form coherent electron–hole pairs through non-geminate recombination due to a Coulomb interaction. In general, the electron–hole pairs can generate three different outcomes: (i) dissociation into free carriers, (ii) spontaneous recombination, and (iii) coherent recombination. Under the influence of intrinsic ferroelectric polarization, the electron–hole pairs can be effectively dissociated into free carriers at low excitation intensities due to their strong ionic properties and low binding energies. However, at high excitation intensities, electron–hole pairs can experience mutual Coulomb interactions, leading to Coulomb-correlated electron–hole pairs. This can give rise to a coherent light-emitting behavior with low threshold excitation intensity in perovskites. Therefore, investigating the dynamic behaviors of electron–hole pairs can deepen the understanding to advance photovoltaic, light-emitting, and lasing actions in perovskites.
3.4 Charge-transfer states
K. G. Stamplecoskie et al. observed a 480 nm band transition in CH3NH3PbI3 in addition to a 760 nm band edge transition by using a time-resolved absorption measurement (as shown in Fig. 9).72 The two band transitions were initially assigned to two valence bands (VB1 and VB2) and common conduction band minimum (CB).73 However, the dual valence-band model cannot account for the discrepancy in recovery kinetics at the two spectral positions. With further studies they attributed the 760 nm and 480 nm transitions to charge separated states (free charge carriers) and charge-transfer states, respectively. Specifically, the charge-transfer states are related to I2-like species (CH3NH3PbI3 + hν → [CH3NH3PbI⋯I2]), which do not present free carrier kinetics. Considering the nature of charge-transfer states, the methylammonium ions are possibly aligned under an external electric field to further enhance photovoltaic performance.74

4. Exciton binding energy in perovskites
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is a key parameter to generate photovoltaic actions in perovskite solar cells. The exciton binding energy has been estimated by theoretical calculation,75 optical absorption,76 magneto-absorption,30 or temperature-dependent PL.31,77 In the 1990s, theoretical studies reported the exciton binding energy to be around 37 meV in CH3NH3PbI3.30 This low binding energy suggests that the excitons are Mott–Wannier type with a Bohr radius of about 30 Å.30,76,78 It is noted that the exciton binding energy in perovskites is much lower than that in organic materials which is usually in the range of 0.2 eV to 1 eV.79 The low binding energy, together with long diffusion length, can account for the high PECs in perovskite solar cells. In contrast, organic solar cells require effective donor: acceptor interfaces to dissociate the Frenkel excitons with high binding energy into free charge carriers towards the generation of photocurrent.80,81 Here, the large difference in exciton binding energy between perovskites and organics can be attributed to different dielectric constants. Recently, Hu et al.28 observed a high dielectric constant (∼32) in perovskites under dark conditions. Furthermore, Juarez-Perez et al.29 showed that the dielectric constant can be largely enhanced (∼1000) under photoexcitation. More recently, Lin et al.75 found that this high dielectric constant can lead to an ultralow binding energy (<10 meV) in low light illumination. In contrast, organic materials only show a dielectric constant of about 3.82,83 The high and low dielectric constants can lead to strong and weak dielectric screening effects.84,85 Clearly, the dielectric constant is an important parameter in controlling the binding energy towards generation of photocurrent in solar cells. Alternatively, the binding energy can be modified by local polarizations induced by built-in fields, plasmonic effects, and doping. Recent studies demonstrated that binding energy can be indeed changed by using (i) different interfacial layers,86–88 (ii) plasmonic effects by doping core–shell metal nanoparticles into perovskites,9 and (iii) different halogen elements (I− or Cl−).14,89,90 These three methods are discussed in the following sections.
4.1 Interfacial layer effects on binding energy
Interfacial layers play a crucial role in improving the PCEs of PV cells.91,92 Recently, Wu et al.93 showed that interfacial layers can affect exciton binding energy in organic solar cells by introducing strong interfacial dipoles between the interfacial layer and organic active layer. The interfacial dipoles can modulate the built-in field across the photovoltaic layer and consequently decreases the exciton binding energy. Similarly, we have observed that perovskite films with and without an interlayer present different photoluminescence quenching as a function of external reversed bias (as shown in Fig. 10). This experimental observation shows that interfacial dipoles formed at a perovskite/interlayer interface can also decrease the exciton binding energy, leading to an enhanced charge dissociation in perovskite solar cells. Roiati et al.87 discussed the observation that interfacial dipoles can be formed when the perovskites active layer contacts with a metal oxide interfacial layer, as shown in Fig. 11a. In this study, they used Stark spectroscopy to confirm the oriented permanent dipoles formed at the interface in perovskite solar cells. On the other hand, Choi et al.88 found that the optical properties can be significantly modulated when a perovskite film is prepared on a mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2) layer. Fig. 11b shows that the absorption tail can be significantly changed by the TiO2 layer. This spectral change can be attributed to the confinement effects caused by nanoscale grains in perovskite polycrystals. In addition, the spectral shift in optical absorption induced by a TiO2 interfacial layer suggests that the interfacial dipoles can affect the bandgap of perovskite samples.

4.2 Plasmonic effects on exciton binding energy
Doping has been demonstrated as an effective approach to enhance electrical conductivity94 and optical absorption in organic materials.95 Recently, Zhang et al.31 found that doping Au@SiO2 (a core–shell nano-particle) into mesoporous perovskite solar cells causes a decrease of exciton binding energy due to the plasmonic effect. In addition, the plasmonic effect can also influence the dipole–dipole interaction between photoexcited states. Fig. 12a and b show the time-integrated PL as a function of temperature for perovskite films with and without doping Au@SiO2 nanoparticles. Here, curve fitting indicates that doping with nanoparticles leads to a reduction of binding energy from 98.0 meV to 34.3 meV. In addition, doping with Au@SiO2 nanoparticles shows a higher PCE in the perovskite solar cell (Fig. 12c).

4.3 Halogens effects on exciton binding energy
The exciton binding energies in CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3−xClx have been reported as 37–50 meV (ref. 30) and 98 meV,31 respectively. There are two possible mechanisms accounting for controlling these exciton binding energies based on halogen effects. First, using different halogen elements with different ionic sizes can modulate the bandgap by shifting the valence band to higher energy in the perovskites.89,90 Changing the bandgap can consequently modify the exciton binding energy by changing the Bohr radius. Second, different halogen elements can cause different dielectric screening effects, leading to changes in the binding energy. It should be noted that additional studies are required to further clarify these two possible mechanisms in order to understand the effects of halogens on binding energy in perovskites.
5. Ferroelectric properties
Perovskites can be prepared in both polycrystalline and single crystalline forms.22,42,43,96 In general, ferroelectric properties can be theoretically expected due to the breaking of crystal center symmetry caused by a structural transition from orthorhombic phase to tetragonal phase.96,97 In particular, intrinsic ferroelectric polarizations provide additional mechanisms to control key photovoltaic parameters, including Jsc, Voc, and FF in perovskite solar cells.
5.1 Theoretical calculations of ferroelectric properties
Computational studies involving electronic structure, ab initio molecular dynamics, and density function theory have been carried out to understand ferroelectric properties in perovskites.32,33,98 Organic CH3NH3+ molecules in perovskites are apart with each other around ∼6 Å. Together with their large permanent electric dipoles, the dipole–dipole interaction energy has been estimated to be 25 meV.33 It should be noted that this relatively low dipole–dipole interaction energy is comparable to thermal energy at room temperature, therefore, a complex ferroelectric behavior is expected by the rotation of these dipoles. Frost et al.32 predicted a transition from an antiferroelectric alignment of dipoles at low temperature to a paraelectric alignment at high temperature by using Monte Carlo simulations. More importantly, they also proposed an equilibrium ferroelectric domain structure and polarizability arising from CH3NH3+ molecular rotation in perovskites. Furthermore, the ferroelectric domains are conjectured to vary as a function of temperature and applied electric field due to rotation of the organic cations. As a consequence, it can be theoretically expected that perovskites can exhibit intrinsic ferroelectric properties.
5.2 Experimental results of ferroelectric properties
Recent works reported ferroelectricity in perovskites based on direct or indirect experimental measurements. Kutes et al. observed direct evidence for ferroelectric domains in β-CH3NH3PbI3 by using piezoforce microscopy (PFM).99 The ferroelectric domains were determined to be ∼ 100 nm, which can be reversely switched by a DC bias with β-CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. 13). Furthermore, Juarez-Perez et al. found an intrinsic giant dielectric constant in the order of ε0 = 1000, which can be further increased by a factor of 1000 under photoexcitation, with CH3NH3PbI3−xClx (Fig. 14).29 This giant dielectric constant corresponds to the modification of local unit cells mediated by photo-induced carriers and the change of polarizations with the assistance of organic cations rotations. Stoumpos et al.22 observed a non-ohmic hysteresis behavior from CH3NH3PbI3 upon changing the current polarity in dark conditions (Fig. 15). The non-ohmic hysteretic behavior originates from the reorientation of permanent dipoles of CH3NH3+ on application of an external electric field. Therefore, it is possible to align the permanent dipoles in organic cations with an external electric field, leading to ferroelectric domains and ultimately the ferroelectricity in perovskites. In addition, Xiao et al.100 reported a switchable photocurrent by applying a low electric field in perovskite photovoltaic devices. This electric field-switchable photocurrent can be related to the ferroelectric properties in perovskite solar cells. Consequently, the experimental studies showed that the permanent dipoles from organic cations can be conveniently modified by an external field, such as photoexcitation or electric field, and consequently lead to ferroelectric properties in perovskites.

5.3 Tuning ferroelectric properties
In general, ferroelectric properties can be tuned by manipulating organic cations in perovskites. Frost et al.32 predicted that the molecular dipoles can be changed by using organic molecules with different electronegativity, which can lead to different polarizations in perovskites. Wu et al.101 found that changing the organic molecular structure from CH3NH3+ to NH2CHNH2+ can largely affect dielectric properties due to different organic molecular dipoles. In addition, they also indicated that changing the metal atoms from Pb to Sn can influence the dielectric properties because of different ionic polarizabilities of Pb2+ and Sn2+. Clearly, ferroelectric properties can be easily tuned by modifying the components due to different dipole strengths.
5.4 Ferroelectric effects on photovoltaic actions
In general, ferroelectric polarization can affect charge transport, recombination, and collection in the development of photovoltaic actions in solar cells. Frost et al.102 and Liu et al.32 reported that ferroelectric polarization can enhance charge separation and improve carrier lifetime due to transportation of carriers through the “ferroelectric highways” established by ferroelectric domains. Furthermore, Grinberg et al.103 observed that the photovoltage can be larger than the bandgap in perovskite oxides: [KNbO3]1−x[BaNi1/2Nb1/2O3-δ]x(KBNNO). Clearly, ferroelectric polarization can function as a promising mechanism to tune open-circuit voltage (Voc) by promoting desirable charge dissociation in perovskite solar cells. In addition, perovskite solar cells can exhibit hysteresis phenomena in device performance which can be related to ferroelectric polarization, charge trapping, and moving ions during device operation.32,33,104,105 Nevertheless, we can see from recent studies that ferroelectric polarization can play an important role in developing advanced photovoltaic actions in perovskite solar cells. In addition, it should be mentioned that ferroelectric properties can present a potential application in spintronics. Rashba effects have been theoretically predicted by considering coexisted ferroelectric polarization and strong spin–orbital coupling.106,107 This presents a new approach to develop spintronics devices by using ferroelectrically semiconducting perovskites. Clearly, perovskite solar cells can provide a platform to explore new magneto-optic and magneto-electric phenomena based on Rashba effects.
6. Magnetic field effects
In general, magnetic field effects can provide unique experimental measurements to reveal internal photovoltaic processes in solar cells under device-operating conditions.108,109 Two decades ago, Hirasawa et al.30 reported the first magnetic field effects at low temperature (4.2 K) and high field (>20 Tesla) in CH3NH3PbI3. However, at room temperature and low field it has been a challenge to develop magnetic field effects in perovskites. Recently, magnetic field effects were shown at room temperature and low field (<200 mT) in photoluminescence and photocurrent in perovskites, leading to magneto-photoluminescence and magneto-photocurrent.34,35 The experimental studies proposed that the magnetic field effects originate from electron–hole pairs generated by photoexcitation or electrical excitation. In principle, the electron–hole pairs are formed with spin-antiparallel and spin-parallel states. Formation rates for spin-antiparallel and spin-parallel states are essentially determined by spin-conserving, from spin-exchange interaction, and spin mixing, from hyperfine and spin–orbital coupling. Before applying a magnetic field, the competition between spin-conserving and spin-mixing reaches an equilibrium, leading to certain populations on spin-antiparallel and spin-parallel states in electron–hole pairs. Applying a magnetic field can disturb spin-conserving and spin-mixing by introducing in-phase and out-phase spin precessions, modifying the formation rates in spin-antiparallel and spin-parallel states. When the electron–hole pairs relax into excitons, modifying formation rates in spin-antiparallel and spin-parallel states can change the populations of singlet and triplet excitons, leading to a change on photoluminescence intensity, namely magneto-photoluminescence (Fig. 16a). Simultaneously, this can change the density of electron–hole pairs available for charge dissociation, generating a modification on photocurrent (Fig. 16a). As a consequence, magneto-photocurrent can be observed in perovskite solar cells. Clearly, recently observed magnetic field effects indicate that both photocurrent and photoluminescence are a spin-dependent process. Therefore, manipulating spins can provide a new approach to control photovoltaic and light-emitting properties in perovskites.

In the recent studies on magnetic field effects, Zhang et al.34 showed a negative magneto-photocurrent in perovskite solar cells (Fig. 17). The observed magnetic field effects were described by a Δg mechanism. Due to the different g factors of electron and hole,110,111 spin precessions can essentially change the populations on spin-antiparallel and spin-parallel states in electron–hole pairs. Furthermore, Hsiao et al. reported that, only when photoexcitation exceeds critical intensity, negative magneto-photoluminescence and positive magneto-photocurrent can be observed at room temperature and low field (<200 mT) in perovskite solar cells (Fig. 16b).35 Below the critical excitation intensity, both magneto-photoluminescence and magneto-photocurrent become negligible. This experimental observation provided information to support the hypothesis that the magnetic field effects originate from electron–hole pairs. However, further investigations are necessary to understand how the spin-dependent electron–hole pairs are still operative in perovskites where strong spin-orbital coupling exists. Nevertheless, recent studies indicate that photovoltaic actions and light emission are a spin-dependent process in perovskites.

7. Conclusions and prospects
In summary, this review article discussed the fundamental physics involved in photovoltaic processes in perovskite solar cells. The discussion focused on ambipolar transport characteristics, photoexcited carriers versus excitons, exciton binding energies, ferroelectric properties, and magnetic field effects to provide critical understanding for further advancing device performance in perovskite solar cells. In the first section, we reviewed ambipolar transport characteristics. In particular, the ambipolar transport properties can lead to both n-type and p-type behaviors, depending on differently selected interfacial layers. In the second section, we discussed the dual types of photoexcited states: photoexcited carriers versus photoexcited excitons. The discussion focused on the effects of excitation intensity and wavelength on the carrier/exciton ratio. In the third section, we analyzed exciton binding energy in relationship with dielectric constant, doping, halogen elements, and interfacial layers. In the fourth section, we discussed ferroelectric properties with a focus on theoretical and experimental results. In the last section, we reviewed recent studies on magnetic field effects in perovskites. The discussion considered two basic processes to generate magnetic field effects by introducing (i) in-phase spin precessions and (ii) out-phase spin precessions in electron–hole pairs. Clearly, magnetic field effects indicate that photovoltaic and light-emitting actions are a spin-dependent process in perovskites. Overall, this review article discussed the photophysics and spinphysics involved in photovoltaic processes in perovskite solar cells.
