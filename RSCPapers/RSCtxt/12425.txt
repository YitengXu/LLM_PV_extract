    , Accepted 18th November 2016First published on 21st December 2016AbstractCu2CoSnS4 (CCTS) and Cu2NiSnS4 (CNTS) can be regarded as Cu2ZnSnS4 compounds with the Zn2+ replaced by Co2+ and Ni2+, and are alternative absorber materials in thin film solar cells. Here, we fabricated high-quality CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal thin films by employing the ion substitution strategy. We systematically studied the crystal structures, surface morphologies and compositions of the as-prepared and selenized thin films via X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The selenized CCTS and CNTS films showed an obvious phase separation process for the oxidizing reaction of Co2+ and Ni2+ with high-temperature selenium steam, and then formed Cu2Sn(S,Se)3, Co(S,Se)2 and Ni(S,Se)2 compounds. We successfully fabricated photodetector devices using CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal films, and achieved a strong and reversible photoresponse performance.
1. Introduction
Recently, metal sulfoselenides, such as Sb2(S,Se)3,1–3 CuBiS2,4,5 CuSb(S,Se)2,6,7 Cu2SnS3,8,9 Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe)10–14 and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe),15–20etc., have been regarded as promising solar cell absorber materials. These materials have demonstrated encouraging photoelectric conversion efficiencies in photovoltaic devices. The ion substitution approach has played an important role in enhancing the properties of metal sulfoselenides, such as adjusting the band gap,14–20 inhibiting the formation of defect4,12 and reducing the material costs,21 and in the preparation of new, alternative compounds.14 Among all of the metal sulfoselenides, the kesterite structure CZTSSe, with a large absorption coefficient and suitable direct band gap, and containing earth-abundant elements, has shown huge potential in the application of solar cells.22,23 Metal cations in CZTSSe can be partly or entirely substituted for other cations, so the ion substitution approach is an excellent strategy for preparing alternative materials or improving the performance of CZTSSe compounds by modification of their optical, electrical, magnetic and structural characteristics, etc. For instance, the Cu+ ion in the CZTSSe compound can be substituted for Ag+24 and Li+;25 the Zn2+ can be replaced for Cd2+,26 Mn2+,27 Fe2+,28 Mg2+,29 Co2+30–34 and Ni2+;33,35–38 and Sn4+ can be substituted for Ge4+.39,40 Meanwhile, the ratio of S/Se can seriously affect the band gap of CZTSSe compounds ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 eV, and the substitution process of S by Se in the high-temperature annealing process could significantly enhance the grains’ growth.23 Whether an ion can be replaced to form new materials mainly depends on the valence, radius and coordination mode of the replacement ions. Plenty of research studies have been reported that are based on the excellent ion substitution approach, including the synthesis of nanocrystals, the fabrication of thin films and the preparation of solar cells.
Cu2CoSnS4 (CCTS) and Cu2NiSnS4 (CNTS) are alternative absorber materials for CIGSSe and CZTSSe compounds, and they can be regarded as CZTS compounds with the Zn2+ replaced by Co2+ and Ni2+.30–38 CCTS and CNTS nanocrystals were first reported by Tang's group30 and Pan's group35 in 2003 and 2012, respectively. They demonstrated that the nanocrystals had suitable band gaps, indicating their potential application in low-cost thin film solar cells. Most of the CCTS and CNTS research has been focused on the synthesis of nanocrystals. Recently, Gupta et al. demonstrated the photoresponse behavior of spray coated CCTS thin films.31 Krupanidhi et al. then deposited CCTS thin films via a simple sol–gel route with smooth surfaces and obtained photocurrent amplification of one order, under both AM 1.5 G and 1064 laser illuminations.32 The CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal films and selenized films need to be systematically studied to review their possibility of practical application in photovoltaic devices. Here, we report a simple solution approach to fabricate high-quality CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal films, and the selenized CCTS and CNTS films were studied in detail. In contrast to the selenized CZTS films, the selenized CCTS and CNTS films showed an obvious phase separation process, since the Co2+ and Ni2+ were oxidized easily by the high-temperature selenium steam, and then formed Co(S,Se)2 and Ni(S,Se)2 compounds. Interestingly, photodetector devices were successfully fabricated using CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal films, and demonstrated a strong and reversible photoresponse performance. The photoresponse property of CCTS and CNTS films indicates that they have high potential in the application of nanocrystal-based thin film solar cells.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
Cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 99.9%), carbon disulfide (CS2, 99.9%), 1-butylamine (CH3(CH2)3NH2, 99%), 3-mercaptopropionic acid (HSCH2CH2CO2H, 98%), copper(II) acetate monohydrate (Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O, 99.99%), zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 99.99%), tin chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O, 99.99%), thiourea (SC(NH2)2, 99%), nickel(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O, 99.9%), 2-methoxyethanol (HOCH2CH2OCH3, 99.9%) and ethanol (99%) were obtained from Aladdin. Copper(I) oxide (Cu2O, 99.99%) and nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2, 99.9%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and tin(II) oxide (SnO, 99.9%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar.
2.2 Preparation of the precursor solutions
First, 1.5 mL of ethanol, 0.9 mL of CS2 (∼15 mmol), and 1.5 mL of 1-butylamine (∼15 mmol) were mixed slowly in a 25 mL conical flask with magnetic stirring at room temperature. These solutions were prepared for four conical flasks. Afterwards, two amounts of Cu2O (∼1.76 mmol), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (∼2.4 mmol) and Ni(OH)2 (∼2.4 mmol) were loaded into the four flasks, respectively. The flasks were transferred onto a 60 °C hotplate with magnetic stirring until all of the solid was dissolved. The Sn precursor solution was prepared using a similar procedure, except for the thioglycolic acid. The Sn precursor solution contained 2 mL of ethanol, 1.2 mL of CS2 (∼20 mmol), 2 mL of 1-butylamine (∼20 mmol), 0.5 mL 3-mercaptopropionic acid and SnO (∼2 mmol). Subsequently, CCTS and CNTS were prepared by mixing the corresponding precursor solutions. Finally, the CCTS and CNTS precursor solutions were diluted with ethanol to a total metal concentration of 0.5 M, followed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 5 min prior to spin-casting. We put two portions of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O (∼1.6 mmol), SnCl2·2H2O (∼0.8 mmol), thiourea (∼5.1 mmol) and 2-methoxyethanol (HOCH2CH2OCH3 ∼3 mL) into two flasks, and added Co(NO3)2·6H2O (∼1 mmol) to one flask and Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O (∼1 mmol) to the other. Afterwards, we transferred the flasks onto the 60 °C hotplate with magnetic stirring until all of the solid was dissolved. The CCTS and CNTS precursor solutions were diluted with 2-methoxyethanol to a total metal concentration of 0.5 M, and subsequently the two solutions were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5 min prior to spin-casting. All of the procedures were conducted in air.
2.3 Preparation of the CCTS and CNTS films
The CCTS and CNTS dithiocarbamate-based precursor solutions were spun on soda-lime glass, ITO (indium tin oxide) glass and Mo-coated glass (20 × 20 × 1.1 mm) at 3000 rpm for 30 s. This was followed by an annealing process on a 320 °C hot plate for 3 min to remove the volatile organic solvent and form CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal thin films. For the selenized samples, the above processes were repeated 8 times to form films with a thickness of ∼1.5 μm. Meanwhile, for the samples for fabricating the nanocrystal-based photodetector devices, the above processes were repeated 3 times to form ∼540 nm CCTS and CNTS thin films. The CCTS and CNTS metal/thiourea precursor solutions were spun on the Mo-coated glass (20 × 20 × 1.1 mm) at 3000 rpm for 30 s, then annealed at 400 °C on a hot plate for 3 min, and this procedure was repeated 8 times to form CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal thin films with a thickness of ∼1.5 μm.
2.4 Preparation of the selenized CCTS and CNTS thin films
The as-prepared CCTS and CNTS thin films that were prepared using the dithiocarbamate-based precursor solutions and were deposited on Mo-coated glass were annealed at 400 °C for 10 min prior to the selenization process. Subsequently, four films and 100 mg of selenium powder were sealed in a graphite box (∼60 mm in diameter and ∼50 mL in volume) under nitrogen ambience. This was followed by a selenization process at 460 °C, 500 °C, 540 °C and 580 °C for 10 min in a rapid thermal processing (RTP) furnace (MTI, OTF-1200X-4-RTP) under nitrogen flow (80 mL min−1). The as-prepared CCTS and CNTS thin films that were prepared using the metal/thiourea precursor solutions and were deposited on Mo-coated glass were annealed in a rapid thermal processing (RTP) furnace with a heating temperature of 540 °C for 10 min.
2.5 Preparation of the CCTS and CNTS photodetector devices
The as-prepared CCTS and CNTS thin films that were prepared using the dithiocarbamate-based precursor solutions and were deposited on glass were annealed at 320 °C for 3 min prior to the device fabrication. Subsequently, ∼2 μm Al-grid electrodes were thermally evaporated on the surface of the thin films.
2.6 Characterization
XRD patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken using a Hitachi S-4800 equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) analyzer (Bruker AXS XFlash detector 4010). The sample for the EDS measurements was prepared on a glass slide. J–V curves were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter and a solar simulator (Abet Sun 2000; AM 1.5) using a home-made probe station. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport optical power meter (model 842-PE) certified by Newport.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves of the CCTS and CNTS precursors. The TGA/DSC samples were fabricated by drying the precursor solutions at 60 °C for 48 h. The first stage of slow weight loss from 25 to 160 °C was mainly attributed to the evaporation of residual solvent. The drastic weight loss between 160 and 300 °C corresponds to the thermal decomposition of CCTS and CNTS precursors, which leads to the formation of CCTS and CNTS nanocrystals.10,15 Therefore, the temperature of the sintering process should be higher than 300 °C, the point at which the decomposition is completed, and the high-quality CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal thin films can be obtained. We utilized X-ray diffraction (XRD) to analyze the crystal structures of the CNTS and CCTS nanocrystal thin films.
 Fig. 1  TGA and DSC curves of the CCTS and CNTS precursors. 
As shown in Fig. 2a, the XRD patterns of the CNTS and CCTS nanocrystal thin films show very broad diffraction peaks, implying that the CNTS and CCTS thin films are composed of small-sized nanocrystals. The patterns for CNTS display three peaks at 28.5, 47.5, and 56.2°, corresponding to the (111), (220) and (311) planes of the zincblende structure,41 and the patterns for CCTS also show three peaks at 28.6, 48.0 and 56.7°, corresponding to the (111), (220) and (311) planes (Cu2NiSnS4 JCPDS PDF no. 26-0551 and Cu2CoSnS4 JCPDS PDF no. 26-0513).42 There are no characteristic peaks from other impurities in the XRD patterns of the CNTS and CCTS nanocrystal films, which shows that both of the sample structures are pure zincblende structures. The composition of the CNTS thin film is approximately 22.52% Cu, 14.67% Ni, 12.53% Sn and 50.28% S (see Fig. 2b). The ratio Cu/(Ni + Sn) is about 0.82 and the ratio Ni/Sn is about 1.17. Similarly, the composition of the CCTS thin film is approximately 21.71% Cu, 14.34% Co, 12.16% Sn and 51.79% S. The ratio Cu/(Co + Sn) is about 0.81 and the ratio Co/Sn is about 1.17. Both of the CNTS and CCTS films show a copper poor and a Co or Ni rich composition, which is consistent with nanocrystal-based CZTS solar cells.23

Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-prepared CCTS and CNTS thin films. The top-view SEM images of the as-deposited CCTS and CNTS thin films in Fig. 3a and b show smooth and pinhole-free surface characteristics, which are consistent with previously reported CZTS films fabricated via a similar solution process. Very few and tiny cracks were present in the CCTS and CNTS film surfaces through the decomposition process. According to the cross-section SEM images of the CCTS and CNTS films in Fig. 3c and d, the CCTS and CNTS thin film surfaces are smooth and uniform, with a thickness of ∼540 nm, after a consecutive spin-casting process. A compact and consecutive as-prepared film is the key factor in fabricating highly-efficient nanocrystal-based photodetector devices,22 so the SEM images demonstrate that the presented solution process shows outstanding advantages for preparing CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal films. The as-deposited CCTS and CNTS samples were analyzed using UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra. Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†) show that the optical band gaps of CCTS and CNTS are about 1.35 eV and 1.40 eV, respectively, which are suitable for photovoltaic absorber layers.35

The as-deposited CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal thin films were selenized and annealed to form selenized CCTS and CNTS films in a graphite box (∼60 mm in diameter and ∼50 mL in volume) using selenium vapor at 540 °C for 10 min.43 As shown in Fig. 4, the characteristic peaks in the selenized CNTS and CCTS XRD patterns show an obvious phase separation, and show that CNTS and CCTS cannot form single phase CNTSSe and CCTSSe compounds. For the selenized CNTS film, diffraction peaks are observed at 30.0, 33.6, 36.9, 42.8, 50.8, 53.1, 55.6 and 57.8°, which are assigned to the (200), (210), (211), (220), (311), (230) and (321) planes of cubic pyrite Ni(S,Se)2 structures (JCPDS PDF no. 65-1483). The XRD patterns of the selenized CCTS film also display obvious diffraction peaks at 30.6, 34.3, 37.7, 51.8 and 56.8°, which are consistent with the standard card of cubic pyrite Co(S,Se)2 structures (PDF no. 09-0234). Other peaks in the XRD patterns of the selenized CNTS and CCTS films are observed at 27.4, 45.5 and 53.9° corresponding to the (111), (220) and (311) planes of cubic Cu2Sn(S,Se)3 structures (JCPDS PDF no. 89-2877).44 Generally, the metal sulfides will translate to partly selenized metal sulfides in a high-temperature selenization process. In this work in particular, we cannot prepare the CNTSSe and CCTSSe films using a standard selenization process. The Ni2+ and Co2+ cations were oxidized to Ni4+ and Co4+ cations using a high-temperature and strong oxidizing selenium vapor, and then formed the Ni(S,Se)2 and Co(S,Se)2 compounds. The diffraction intensity for Cu2Sn(S,Se)3 is much higher than that for the Ni(S,Se)2 and Co(S,Se)2 compounds, so we can expect that the grain size of Cu2Sn(S,Se)3 is much larger than that of Ni(S,Se)2 and Co(S,Se)2.
 Fig. 4  The powder XRD patterns of selenized CNTS (black) and CCTS (red) films after selenization at 540 °C for 10 min in a graphite box. 
The representative top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of selenized CCTS and CNTS thin films on Mo-coated solid glass are displayed in Fig. 5a and b. After selenization at 540 °C for 10 min, the selenized CCTS film shows an obvious phase separation. The large grains at the surface of the selenized CCTS film have a grain size range from 2 to 6 μm, and small grains have a grain size <100 nm. Similar images can also be found for the selenized CNTS film, except for the fact that the large grains in the selenized CNTS thin film had a size range from 2 to 4 μm, which is smaller than that of the selenized CCTS film, and on the bottom, the small grains with a size range from 200 to 500 nm are larger than those of the selenized CCTS film. Based on the SEM and XRD results, we can conclude that the large grains are Cu2Sn(S,Se)3, and the small grains are Ni(S,Se)2 and Co(S,Se)2 compounds. The cross-sectional SEM images of the selenized CCTS and CNTS films are shown in Fig. 5c and d. The selenized CCTS and CNTS thin films exhibit obvious bi-layer morphology, consisting of a dense and continuous small-grained bottom layer with a thickness of about 500 nm, and a discrete large-grained top layer. The morphology of the selenized CCTS and CNTS films can be explained using the copper-rich crystal growth mechanism.45 The copper-rich regions of the CCTS and CNTS nanocrystals will be the growth centers on the surface of the thin films. The Co2+ and Ni2+ will be oxidized to form Ni(S,Se)2 and Co(S,Se)2 compounds, and then separate from the CCTS and CNTS nanocrystals. With the continuing reactions, the copper-rich CCTS and CNTS nanocrystals will form the large Cu2Sn(S,Se)3 grains on the surface of the films, and the small Ni(S,Se)2 and Co(S,Se)2 particles will be present on the bottom of the films.
 Fig. 5  The typical top-view SEM images of the selenized CCTS (a) and CNTS (b) thin films, and a typical cross-sectional view of the selenized CCTS (c) and CNTS (d) thin films. 
For avoiding impact of the selenization temperatures, the as-deposited CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal thin films were selenized at 460 °C, 500 °C and 580 °C for 10 min in a rapid thermal processing (RTP) furnace. As shown in the XRD patterns (Fig. S3, ESI†) and the SEM images (Fig. S4, ESI†), the selenized CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal thin films that were annealed at different temperatures also presented mixed phases. In addition, we fabricated the selenized CCTS and CNTS films using the metal/thiourea solution process, and the XRD patterns (Fig. S5, ESI†) and SEM images (Fig. S6, ESI†) show similar results. Based on these results, we speculate that the CCTSSe and CNTSSe films are thermodynamically unstable compounds.
The chemical compositions of selected spots of the selenized CCTS and CNTS thin films were examined using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), the results of which are shown in Fig. 6.
 Fig. 6  The partial top-view SEM images, EDS spectroscopy and chemical compositions of the selenized CCTS (a and b) and CNTS (c and d) thin films. Element mapping of the selenized CCTS (e) and CNTS (f) thin films. 
The chemical composition of the large grains in the selenized CCTS film is Cu2.0Sn1.0S0.3Se3.0 (Fig. 6b), and the chemical composition of the large grains in the selenized CNTS film is Cu2.2Sn1.0S0.4Se3.2 (Fig. 6d). The EDS analysis shows that the large grains in the selenized CCTS and CNTS films were composed of Cu2Sn(S,Se)3, and the small amount of Co and Ni was mainly caused by test error. Although we tested the chemical composition at a fixed point, it is well known that the paths of the electrons spread into the film with a teardrop shape, so a small amount of Co and Ni could be observed in the Cu2Sn(S,Se)3 grains. For the Ni(S,Se)2 and Co(S,Se)2 particles, the chemical compositions are Co1.0S1.74Se1.79 and Ni1.0S1.83Se1.80. The ratio S/(S + Se) is noticeably higher than that of the Cu2Sn(S,Se)3 grains. The high S content was mainly caused by test error, because the electrons spread into the film and could reach a depth of ∼1 μm. To carry out further analysis, we also examined the selenized CCTS and CNTS thin films using element mapping, which showed a similar image to the samples that were analyzed at a fixed point. As shown in Fig. 6e and f, the large grains that are shaped like teardrops are filled with a high concentration of Cu, Sn and Se, and a relatively low concentration of S, thus providing evidence that the large grains in the selenized CCTS and CNTS films are Cu2Sn(S,Se)3 compounds. In contrast, the small grains had a high concentration of Co, Ni, Se and S, thus confirming that the small grains are Co(S,Se)2 and Ni(S,Se)2.
The photosensitivity of the CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal films was investigated by evaporating Al electrodes onto as-prepared CCTS and CNTS films to build photodetector devices (Fig. S7, ESI†). Glasses were used as the substrate, and Al was applied as the ohmic contact.46 The device area was determined using the electrode length (2 mm) and interelectrode spacing (0.2 mm). Testing was done inside an optically and electrically sealed box, and measured in the dark and under AM 1.5 illumination through a solar simulator with automatic shutter control. In addition, as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the I–V curves of the CCTS and CNTS thin films displayed linear impedance characteristics, thus implying that the contact between the electrode aluminum layer and the CCTS/CNTS absorber layer is a benign ohmic contact rather than a Schottky contact. When a bias of 5 V is applied, the corresponding light current is 32.5 and 29.7 nA, and the dark current is 17.5 and 19.3 nA, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7, a strong and reversible photoresponse is observed for the CCTS and CNTS films. When a bias of 5 V is applied, the CCTS device shows an average dark current of 17.6 nA and an average photocurrent of 32.2 nA, corresponding to a photo-to-dark current ratio of 1.83. Meanwhile, the CNTS device showed an average dark current of 19.3 nA and an average photocurrent of 30.4 nA, corresponding to a photo-to-dark current ratio of 1.58. This demonstrated that the CCTS films showed a better photoresponse compared with the CNTS films. The photoresponse of the CCTS and CNTS films indicates that they have high potential in nanocrystal-based thin film solar cell applications.31,35 Future work will be focused on fabricating CCTS and CNTS solar cells.

4. Conclusions
In summary, high-quality CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal films have been directly prepared using a simple solution approach, and the selenized CCTS and CNTS thin films were systematically studied using XRD, SEM and EDS. The selenized CCTS and CNTS films showed an obvious phase separation process for the oxidizing reaction of Co2+ and Ni2+ with high-temperature selenium steam, and then formed Cu2Sn(S,Se)3, Co(S,Se)2 and Ni(S,Se)2 compounds. We fabricated the photoresponse devices using CCTS and CNTS nanocrystal films, which achieved a strong and reversible photoresponse performance. The photoresponse of the CCTS and CNTS films indicates that they have high potential in nanocrystal-based thin film solar cell applications. Future work will be focused on fabricating CCTS and CNTS solar cells.
