    , Accepted 24th August 2022First published on 25th August 2022AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) are broadly assembled in two ways, i.e., regular (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) structures. Inverted (p–i–n) PSC architecture has attracted attention due to its consistent operational stability and low-temperature synthesis methods. However, its power conversion efficiency is slightly inferior to that of regular (n–i–p) PSCs. The key challenges that still need to be addressed for inverted (p–i–n) PSCs include severe non-radiative recombination losses at the grain boundaries and interfacial trap-assisted recombination at the charge transporting layers/perovskite, which reduce the open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). Consequently, various strategies have been developed to overcome these drawbacks, which mainly include the passivation of traps at the interface, grain boundaries and bulk, adopting different hole and electron transport layers, and using unique perovskites combinations. The improvement in the performance of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs by adopting these approaches is attributed to their increased VOC, with their FFs confined to the range of 75% to 80%. Although, incorporating a modified material can augment the inverted (p–i–n) PSC performance yet the operational stability at high efficiencies is compromised. Additionally, for the commercial applications of this technology, key degradation factors such as moisture, light, and heat need to be considered, which have long plagued the long-term stability of perovskites. Thus, concerted efforts are being directed towards improving the stability of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs without affecting their efficiency and hence the performance of these devices. Presently, the efficiency of inverted PSCs has already surpassed 24%, which is gradually catching up to that of regular-structured (n–i–p) PSCs (25.7%). Therefore, a boost in the performance of these devices together with the establishment of device stability is imperative for future perspectives.
1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) have recently gained significant attention due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties and solution processability.1–6 PSCs are fabricated in two dominant architectures, i.e., regular (n–i–p) (with an n-type material coating the front electrode and p-type the back contact layer) and inverted (p–i–n) (with p-type being deposited as the front electrode to receive rays of light, while the n-type becomes the back contact buffer). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution-processed regular (n–i–p) PSCs has increased to 25.7%,7,8 making them favorable candidates for next-generation solar cells. However, there has been little focus on their stability and durability issues to meet the required industrial standards to sustain the current photovoltaic technology for over 20 years in outdoor conditions.9–11 The PSC devices achieving a record PCE possess the standard regular (n–i–p) device architecture, where the perovskite light absorber layer is sandwiched between an electron transport layer (ETL), for example, titanium dioxide (TiO2) or tin oxide (SnO2) and a hole transport layer (HTL) such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD). Although the high PCE is mostly achieved by devices with a regular structure (n–i–p), their stability is significantly limited owing to the thermophobic dopants and hygroscopic spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL. The hygroscopic behavior of the ionically doped spiro-OMeTAD typically accelerates the degradation of regular n–i–p PSCs in a humid environment. Moreover, hysteresis is another commonly observed phenomenon in regular (n–i–p) PSCs, which affects the device performance and is unsuitable for multijunction/tandem photovoltaics due to the mismatch alignment. In most efficient PSCs, compact/mesoporous scaffolds based on TiO2 are employed as the ETL.12 However, the preparation of mesoporous scaffolds requires a very high sintering temperature in the range of 400–500 °C to create a conductive phase, and thus this high temperature processing technology limits the commercialization of mainly polymer and flexible substrates.
Alternatively, employing phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the ETL of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs results in a more stable performance owing to its lower humidity absorption in air, and thus better conductivity compared to the TiO2 ETL employed in the regular (n–i–p) devices. Moreover, several low cost and durable p-type semiconductors such as nickel oxide (NiOx), copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) and graphene oxide have been employed as top anode buffers in the inverted (p–i–n) architecture, while the choice of efficient candidates for the back electrode is still challenging. Inorganic metal oxide composites with fullerene may furnish a solution to the existing dilemma of suitable configuration with matched energy levels to the photoactive layers and inhibition of corrosion due to ionic diffusion from the perovskite layer.13 Given that the perovskite film is directly in contact with the ETL and HTL in the regular (n–i–p) and inverted (p–i–n) devices, the ETL/HTL must remain stable. In comparison with the regular (n–i–p) structure, inverted (p–i–n) devices retain better repeatability and exhibit less hysteresis, thereby making them more attractive for solar cell research. Recently, the PCE of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs reached 24.3%,14 which is marginally lower than that of regular (n–i–p) PSCs (25.7%).8,15 The improvement in PCE and stability of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs, particularly, in perovskite-based tandem photovoltaics, further led to their batch production as efficient energy harvesters.
Notably, defects can exist at the perovskite surface, grain boundaries and perovskite/ETL and HTL/perovskite interfaces, which cause severe non-radiative recombination (NRR) losses, affecting the open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) and acting as a bottleneck for the PCE of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs.16–20 The NRR sites are generated due to atomic restructuring, the perovskite thin-film surface, and interface deviations, i.e., ETL/perovskite and perovskite/HTL. The VOC of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs compared to the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit for single-junction solar cells21 is considerably lower than that of the regular (n–i–p) PSCs. The drastic loss in VOC of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs is due to the poor ionic bonding and weak coulombic interaction of the perovskite, which severely limit their overall performance. Considering the physical structure of regular (n–i–p) PSCs, the ETL is deposited directly on the bottom conducting FTO glass, followed by consecutive coating of perovskite, HTL, and Au or Ag or Al layers, respectively. Alternatively, inverted (p–i–n) PSCs are obtained by inverting the position of the ETL and HTL in the regular planar device, as shown in Fig. 1, where the inset shows the different ETLs, perovskites, and HTLs used thus far in inverted (p–i–n) PSCs with a high PCE of >20%. Various techniques have been employed and devised to address the detrimental issues that exist in inverted (p–i–n) PSCs. For instance, employing new ETLs, HTLs or perovskites or using additional solvent additives and surface passivators can significantly reduce the NRR, thereby improving the device performance. The most effective strategy is the passivation method to alleviate the defects and inhibit NRR in inverted (p–i–n) PSCs. The different passivators employed thus far in inverted (p–i–n) PSCs delivering a PCE of >20% are shown at the bottom of Fig. 1.

Generally, perovskite films are comprised of a crystal structure (Fig. 2a) and represented as ABX3, where A = formamidinium (FA+), methylammonium (MA+), or cesium (Cs+), B = Pb2+ and/or Sn2+, and X = (I−, Cl−, Br−). Fig. 2(b and c) show the progress achieved in overall PSCs and their inverted counterparts. The inverted (p–i–n) PSCs started their journey in 2014, and since then have displayed a skyrocketing trend in PCE and number of related reports. The PCE of the inverted (p–i–n) PSCs is reaching close to that of regular (n–i–p)-structured PSCs, as depicted in Fig. 2d.

Herein, we review the progress achieved thus far in inverted (p–i–n) PSCs in terms of long-term stability together with the reports of a PCE greater than 20%. We also presents an analysis of the efforts made to overcome the drawbacks of PSCs such as severe NRR losses caused by the presence of defects in the perovskite layer and perovskite/ETL, HTL/perovskite interfaces, which limit the VOC and FF. For instance, the most effective strategy is to use different passivation materials, which significantly reduce the aforementioned issues and enhance the PCE of these devices. We only discuss the results for the methods that delivered a PCE of >20% using passivation, optimizing the preparation process, interfacial engineering, and employing different ETLs and HTLs in inverted (p–i–n) PSCs.
2. Strategies for improving the stability of inverted PSCs with PCE > 20%
The stability of PSCs is one of the major factors limiting their commercialization. To meet the industrial requirements of commercialization, the photovoltaic device must pass the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61215 standards. According to the IEC61215:2016 standard, a damp heat test (85 °C, 85% RH, 1000 h), ultraviolet (UV) preconditioning test (60 °C, 15 kW h m−2), thermal cycling test (−40 to 85 °C, 200 cycles), maximum power point tracking (MPPT), and light soaking test (55 °C ± 5 °C, 1000 h) must be performed for PSCs to gauge the stability of these device.43 However, contrary to these standard stability testing conditions, conventional environmental stability tests such as air stability, long-term storage stability, thermal stability, and light soaking stability tests have been performed to assess the stability of PSCs.44 In the case of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs, the stability of these devices has not been tested under the IEC61215:2016 standards. The instability of PSCs is due to the degradation of the perovskite absorber layer. Thus, it is vital to protect the perovskite absorber layer in (p–i–n) and (n–i–p) PSC devices to obtain superior photovoltaic performances under real environmental conditions. The degradation of the perovskite is caused by external factors such as moisture, oxygen, temperature, and UV radiation, and internal factors such as crystal structure, ion migration, and interfacial contacts.10,45 Furthermore, the fabrication process, constituent materials, and device architecture also affect the stability of PSCs.46 Besides these factors, it has been observed that the inverted (p–i–n) PSCs are more stable than the regular (n–i–p) PSCs. The stability of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs can be achieved by managing the stability of metal halide perovskites and device interfaces. In next few sections, we discuss the methods developed to improve the stability of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs together with maintaining their high efficiency.
2.1 Passivation of surfaces, interfaces and grain boundaries
The perovskite layer sandwiched between the ETL and HTL possesses intrinsic defects on its surface and at the grain boundaries (GBs), leading to detrimental trap states, which cause NRR. Therefore, effective methods are required to minimize the trap density at the perovskite/ETL and HTL/perovskite interfaces and on the perovskite surface. Accordingly, engineering the surface and interface by effective passivation has been recognized as an effective way to remove the detrimental defects on the surface and at the GBs, thereby boosting the overall device performance and inhibiting NRR. The passivation approaches include engineering the perovskite structure and its interface, optimizing the preparation process, and compositional engineering. However, we limit our discussion to the passivation methods that produce stable inverted (p–i–n) PSCs with a PCE greater than 20%.
Wang et al.30 fabricated inverted (p–i–n) PSCs, as shown in Fig. 3a. The ligands 1,4-phenylmercaptan [PHMT], 1,2-ethylenemercaptan [ETMT] and 1-propylmercaptan [PRMT] were used as passivators on the perovskite layer with different concentrations. The inverted (p–i–n) PSCs made with MA/ETMT, MA/PRMT, and MA/PHMT, where MA is methylammonium, showed improved performances compared to the pure MAPbI3, as shown in Fig. 3b. Obviously, according to the photocurrent–photovoltage (J–V) curves, as shown in Fig. 3(c–e), the best inverted (p–i–n) PSCs based on MA/PHMT revealed no hysteresis when run in the reverse and forward scan directions. After exposure to thermal aging at 85 °C in the dark for 500 h, the MA/PHMT device maintained >89% of its initial PCE, while the controlled MAPbI3 device only retained 44% of its initial PCE after 400 h. Moreover, the MA/PHMT device maintained >86% of its initial PCE when exposed to light in an N2 environment for 600 h, while the controlled device suffered from severe degradation with a further decrease of 35% in its initial PCE (Fig. 3f–h). Additionally, after a 2000 h storage test, it was found that the PCE of the controlled device plummeted sharply and it retained an initial efficiency of less than 52%. Remarkably higher durability was manifested for the modified device than the reference device, especially for the MA/PHMT device, maintaining ∼83% of its initial PCE even after 3500 h.

Similarly, Saba et al.28 used a dual passivation method employing a long chain of alkylammonium salt–phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl) and PEACl:PbCl2 as surface treatment and additive, respectively, to simultaneously passivate the perovskite/C60 interface and the grain boundaries. Fig. 4a shows the simplest inverted (p–i–n) PSC architecture, while the J–V characteristics of the best-performing passivated inverted (p–i–n) PSCs, namely, by grain boundary passivation (GBP), surface passivation (SP), and grain boundary and surface passivation (GBP–SP), are shown in Fig. 4b. The best reference PSC and passivated devices such as GBP PSC, SP PSC, and GBP–SP PSC exhibited a PCE of 20.4%, 20.7%, 22.1%, and 22.7%, respectively. With the help of dual passivation, the FF and VOC of the device based on GBP–SP was further enhanced to 83.2% and 1.162 V, respectively, leading to an outstanding PCE of 22.7% (Fig. 4c). It can be seen that the device based on GBP–SP was hysteresis free. The introduction of GBP, SP, and GBP–SP in the inverted (p–i–n) PSC significantly affected the NRR losses, as evident from the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra (Fig. 4d). At low-level injection, a longer monomolecular lifetime led to a decrease in NRR, which was observed in the bulk, GBs, or interface at the HTL/perovskite/ETL. The lifetime of the GBP–SP, SP, GBP, and reference electrodes was 256 ns, 113 ns, 48 ns, and 19 ns, respectively. These values validated the enhancement in VOC for the passivated devices, thereby suppressing the NRR in the inverted (p–i–n) PSC. The device based on GBP–SP passivation yielded a superior performance and was further subjected to stability tests. The devices were kept under heat at 85 °C in the dark for over 1000 h, and it was observed that the GBP–SP PSCs showed enhanced thermal stability versus the reference device (Fig. 4e).

In another report, Jian et al.47 employed tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB) as a passivation agent and demonstrated a decrease in the defects in the perovskite film, thereby enhancing the device performance. It was reported that TOAB only existed at the surface and at the GBs, where it did not participate in the crystallization and nucleation process of the perovskite films. The preparation steps for TOAB passivation on the perovskite film are illustrated in Fig. 5a. The device architecture and the TOAB structure are shown in (Fig. 5b). The double ionic characteristics of TOAB with four long alkyl chains significantly passivated the defects (including positive and negative charges) and protected the perovskite film from moisture. The PL spectra of the electrodes passivated with TOAB, i.e., quartz/MAPbI3–TOAB and quartz-MAPbI3, are shown in Fig. 5c. It was observed that the PL intensity for quartz-MAPbI3–TOAB doubled in comparison to that of quartz-MAPbI3. In addition, the PL spectra for both electrodes after PCBM coating showed strong quenching owing to the efficient charge extraction at the MAPbI3/PCBM interface. The electrode composed of quartz/MAPbI3/TOAB/PCBM showed better quenching behavior than the quartz/MAPbI3/PCBM, validating an additional built-in field formed, thereby improving the carrier separation and charge extraction in the inverted (p–i–n) PSC. The TRPL results showed the lifetimes 207.69 ns and 582.43 ns for the unmodified electrode and TOAB passivated electrode, respectively. Also, the champion device based on TOAB exhibited negligible hysteresis, as shown in Fig. 5d, with a certified PCE of >20%.

Fig. 5e shows a comparison of the stability test for the control and TOAB-based passivated devices. It was observed that the device based on the TOAB passivator showed superior stability in the open environment compared to the control device. The PCE of the device with TOAB showed no variations for the first 120 h, and then showed a slow degradation rate (∼0.13% h−1), whereas the control device exhibited a slight decrease initially for 120 h, and then a decrease at a high rate of 0.23% h−1. The TOAB-based device maintained around 81% of its PCE after exposure to air for 264 h. The enhanced performance of the TOAB-based inverted (p–i–n) PSC was due to the improved hydrophobicity of the perovskite film, surface passivation, and GBs. Similarly, the device stability was also observed in an N2 environment (Fig. 5f), where the device based on TOAB retained 94% of its initial value after 72 days, while the control device degraded and only maintained 60% of its PCE after 63 days.
Here, we explicitly focus on the interfacial stabilization of the perovskite/ETL interface, which is the most vulnerable to deterioration in the operational environment of PSCs. In an inverted (p–i–n) PSC, the top perovskite/ETL interface presents more chances of initiating degradation due to oxygen penetration into the perovskite, thus causing halide diffusion in the electrode. The most used ETL based on fullerene (C60) suffers from interfacial recombination losses and susceptibility to moisture and oxygen ingress. Moreover, its thermal stability is limited due to the aggregation of the fullerene acceptor, which deteriorates the contact between the perovskite and ETL. Given that the by-products of perovskite are volatile, they diffuse via the deteriorated fullerene to further cause the degradation of the whole device. The electrode metals react with the decomposed perovskite mobile ions, causing shunting at low reverse bias voltages. Therefore, it is crucial to stabilize the perovskite/ETL interface to achieve long-term stability and high PCE in inverted (p–i–n) PSCs. In this regard, Chen et al.48 employed boron chloride subphthalocyanine (Cl6SubPc) at the C60 ETL in an inverted (p–i–n) PSC, resulting in a PCE of 22.0%, which retained its initial value of 98% after 2000 h under heat at 80 °C in an inert environment. This device was tested outdoors for the first time, and 95% of its PCE value was maintained. The device architecture of (p–i–n) PSCs and the chemical structure of Cl6SubPc are shown in Fig. 6(a and b), respectively. Here, in this study, the authors employed mixed perovskite CsFAMA, termed 3D perovskite, where Cs is cesium, FA is formamidinium and 2-phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) solution-treated perovskite CsFAMA termed as 3D/2D perovskite (Fig. 6b). It was observed that the PEAI solution treatment produce 2D capping layers, and thereby passivated the defects on the surface. The longer organic spacers made it resistive to water penetration, therefore enhancing the device stability. The dark J–V curves demonstrated that the 2D capping layer significantly upshifted the conduction band, decreasing the trap density and maintaining smooth electron mobility in the 3D perovskite. The PCE of the device based on 3D/2D perovskite/C60 improved from 20.2% to 20.8%. Furthermore, the PCE increased to 22.0% by employing bilayers such as the 3D/2D perovskite/Cl6SubPc/C60 (8 nm/20 nm) structure (Fig. 6c).

In another similar report, Liu et al.49 developed an inverted (p–i–n) PSC with a high PCE of 20.9% employing FACs perovskites with NiOx as the HTL. A schematic of the inverted (p–i–n) PSC structure is shown in Fig. 6d. For surface passivation, the organic dye coumarin 343 (C343) was introduced, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6e. It was demonstrated that the strong coordination between the under-coordinated Pb2+ and the carboxyl groups present in C343 significantly reduced the defect densities and improved the crystal growth of the perovskite surface. The J–V curve and stability of the inverted (p–i–n) PSC are shown in Fig. 6e. The device maintained around 95% of its initial value after aging for 500 h at 85 °C.
Cao et al.50 employed a 3D star-shaped molecule named polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane-poly (POSP) as an antisolvent additive in an inverted (p–i–n) PSC. A schematic of the inverted (p–i–n) PSC comprising ITO/NiOx-perovskite-PCBM + C60–BCP–Cr–Au is shown in Fig. 7a. The control device yielded a PCE of 19.23%, while that with the incorporation of POSP increased significantly to 22.74% (Fig. 7b). The PL and TRPL spectra for the control and POSP-based electrodes are shown in Fig. 7c and d, where they display a blueshift for POSP from 780 to 775 nm. These results clearly validated that the incorporation of POSP significantly reduced the defects at the GBs and on the surface, thereby significantly suppressing the NRR. The operational stability of the encapsulated inverted (p–i–n) PSCs for the control, POSP-modified, and poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) devices under one sun condition in the open air are shown in Fig. 7e. The controlled device retained a PCE of ∼47% (initial PCE of ∼18.29%) after 600 h, whereas the PMMA-based device maintained a PCE of 77% (initial PCE ∼20.83%) after 1000 h. The POSP-passivated device retained 93% of its initial PCE of ∼22.00% after 1000 h. The contact angle based on the POSP-modified perovskite surface was 75.30°, while in the absence of POSP modification, it was only 47.591°, revealing the enhancement in the hydrophobicity of the perovskite film.

Zheng et al.22 employed alkylamine ligands (AALs) with different alkyl chain lengths, namely, n-butylamine (BA), phenethylamine (PEA), octylamine (OA), and oleylamine (OAm), as surface passivators on the perovskite film. TRPL was performed to assess the quality of the pure perovskite films and the passivated surfaces using AALs with different alkyl chain lengths. It can be observed that the perovskite films with long-alkyl-chain AALs (OA or OAm) showed much higher carrier lifetimes (τ) (τOA = 789 ns; τOAm, τ = 1049 ns) than that of the films with short-alkyl-chain AALs (τBA = 195 ns and τPEA = 265 ns) and pristine films (τ = 114 ns). The longer carrier lifetimes revealed that the long-alkyl chain AALs significantly suppressed the non-radiative recombination at the perovskite interfaces. The typical J–V curves of the CsFAMA devices with AALs having different alkyl-chains showed that the control device exhibited a typical PCE of 20.5%, whereas the PCE based on the short-alkyl-chain AAL (BA or PEA)-passivated CsFAMA was slightly enhanced to 20.8% and 20.9%, respectively, due to the ∼30 mV rise in VOC. In contrast, the devices passivated with long-alkyl-chain AALs (OA or OAm) delivered a very high PCE of 22.0% and 23%, respectively, resulting from the 10 mV rise in VOC. The best PSC with OAm delivered a PCE of 23% with JSC = 24.1 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.17 V, and FF = 81.6%. Furthermore, the long-term stability of the perovskite passivated with AALs and the pristine devices was compared. The pristine device lost about 42% of its initial PCE after 350 h, while the devices with AALs maintained their performance for 1000 h without loss of their initial PCE value. The devices were also tested at a fixed temperature of 85 °C, where the pristine devices lost about 39% of their initial value, whereas the devices passivated with AALs maintained 90% of their initial value for about 1020 h.

2.1.1 Device interface engineering. 
Ionic defects on the surface of perovskite layers are vital for the fabrication of PSCs with excellent PCE and stability. The GBs allow the moisture to react with the perovskite layer and act as a pathway for ion migration, which are also sensitive to heat.51–53 Therefore, the passivation of perovskite defects is an effective strategy to achieve high stability with a high PCE. In inverted (p–i–n) PSCs, small or large organic molecules with high hydrophobicity have been used for the passivation of the perovskite surface defects, causing an improvement in the perovskite film morphology and crystallinity at the interfaces. In inverted (p–i–n) PSCs, the two interfaces, i.e., ETL/perovskite and perovskite/HTL interfaces, are very important to impart stability to the device without compromising its PCE. Various organic molecules have been used to treat the perovskite surface at the ETL and HTL interfaces to achieve high-quality defect-free perovskite films. In this context, the stability of the champion devices was maintained by using organic molecules/slats such as the 2FBT2FPDI (bisfluorobenzothiadiazole-dithiophene-fused bis-N,N′-bis(1-ethylpentyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid bisimides),54 CIGD-PCBM (modified PCBM),55 benzenebutanammonium iodide (PBAI),41 spiro[fluorene-9,9-phenanthren-10-one] derivative (MS-OC),56 2,8-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-5-dodecyl-4H thieno[2′,3′:4,5] thieno[3,2-c]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[2,3-e]azepine-4,6(5H)-dione (MPA-BTTI),57 poly[3-(4-carboxybutyl)thiophene-2,5-diyl] (P3CT)58 PFDT-COOH and PFDT-COOH and fluorinated derivative, PFDT-2F-COOH,59 2-phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI),15 pyridine-based polymers (PPY2),60 piperazinium iodide (PI),42 2,2′-bithiazolothienyl-4,4′,10,10′-tetracarboxydiimide (PDTzTI),61 surface-anchoring alkylamine ligands (AALs),22S-acetylthiocholine chloride,62 tetraoctylammonium bromide,47 5-methoxy-2-mercaptobenzimidazole (MBI-OCH3),34 buffer layer containing C60:Co-TiO2,63 surface passivation poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile) polymer (PS-PAN polymer),32 p-conjugated dual-ligand 1,4-phenylmercaptan (PHMT),30 and CdxZn1−xSeyS1−y quantum dots (QDs).64


2.1.2 Defect encapsulation. 
Defect encapsulation is one of the effective strategies to improve the stability of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs. The encapsulation protects the device against oxygen and moisture. Various methods have been reported for encapsulation such as UV-curable epoxy sealing,28 air-sealed encapsulation,65 atomic layer deposition,66 and roll-lamination,67 where currently, UV curable glues are used for the encapsulation of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs.68,69 However, this method has not been used to fabricate champion (high PCE) inverted (p–i–n) PSCs. Thus, it is vital to explore the encapsulation technique to explore the stability of inverted (p–i–n) PSCs against environmental conditions.

2.2 Relaxation of residual stress at the surface and interfaces
Considering the relaxation of residual stress (strain) as an effective parameter to improve both the stability and efficiency of solar cells, it has been investigated in both inverted and non-inverted PSCs. Recently, Li et al.42 developed a unique bifunctional molecule named piperazinium iodide, which is comprised of R2NH2+ and R2NH groups, acting as electron acceptors and donors, respectively, to react with various surface-terminating groups. A Pb–N bond was reported to be formed by piperazinium iodide in the single crystal of (piperazinium iodide)2PbI2·2-dimethyl sulfoxide [(P.I.)2PbI2·2DMSO]. Therefore, it could be used to explore the chemical interactions between PbI2 and piperazinium iodide. The introduction of piperazinium iodide for surface treatment is helpful to release the residual stress in the surface and achieve more n-type behavior in the film to support charge transfer. The NRR loss was significantly suppressed, thereby reducing the VOC loss to 0.33 V. A schematic illustration of the fabricated device and the J–V curve of the champion device is shown in Fig. 8(a and b) with a PCE of 23.37% and VOC of 1.17 V. Fig. 8c depicts the stabilized PCE of 22.88%, which is in close agreement with the obtained PCE from the J–V curves. The significantly enhanced PCE using piperazinium iodide passivator is solely due to the improved VOC of ∼1.17 V for the piperazinium iodide-based passivation devices, whereas the VOC of the reference device was limited to 1.06 V. Additionally, the piperazinium iodide passivation improved the device performance and enhanced its stability. For instance, the encapsulated inverted PSC maintained 93% of its initial PCE under a damp air environment (R.H. 55% ± 5%, 25 °C), whereas the PCE of the reference device was reduced to 40% under the same environmental conditions. A continuous photon dose test was performed for 200 h, where the piperazinium iodide-passivated-based device retained >98% of its initial PCE, while the reference device only maintained 87% of its initial value. The photoluminescence (PL) peaks for the piperazinium diiodide- and piperazinium iodide-passivated surfaces were 3 and 5 times higher than that of the pure device, respectively, clarifying the loss of non-radiative recombination (Fig. 8d).

Similarly, Degani et al.15 introduced a series of bulky organic cations for dual modification of both the perovskite/ETL and HTL/perovskite interfaces. The employed organic cations including 2-phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI), 4-chlorophenylethylammonium iodide (Cl-PEAI), and 4-fluorophenylethylammonium iodide (F-PEAI), as depicted in Fig. 8e. This unique approach of surface passivation significantly enhanced the film formation on top of the HTL and induced efficient defect passivation at the ETL/perovskite interface, which led to a substantial increase in the FF accompanied with only a slight rise in the short circuit current (JSC). The top perovskite surface modification exhibited efficient passivation resulting in a significant enhancement in the VOC, thereby simultaneously increasing the overall performance of the device. A schematic illustration of the inverted (p–i–n) PSC is shown in Fig. 8f. The champion device delivered a PCE of 23.7%, with the VOC of ∼1.184 V and FF limited to 85% (Fig. 8g). Fig. 8h displays the stability test under constant illumination in an N2 atmosphere. It was also observed that the devices based on PEAI, F-PEAI, and Cl-PEAI showed a stable performance and maintained their original performance for the entire time compared to the reference device.
Moreover, Wang et al.70 revealed that residual stress is generally associated with the surfaces of prepared perovskite films; moreover, they developed an approach to release the interfacial stress through alloying the A-site cations. This further resulted in an improvement in the microstrain inside the lattices. The resultant photovoltaic devices exhibited a PCE of 21.48% together with improved resistance against thermal cycling and excellent stability against humidity. The FA0.85MA0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite films were synthesized in a solvent mixture of DMF and DMSO. Consequently, isopropanol (IPA) with or without octylammonium iodide (OAI) and PEAI were spin coated on the surface of the films. The schematic in Fig. 9a shows the process for the fabrication of these perovskite films. The increase in stress release was higher with an increase in PEAI concentration compared to OAI, where a reduction of 72 MPa residual stress was observed in the PEAI post-treated perovskite films. Similarly, the incorporation of A-site cations was also proven to effectively tailor the interfacial interaction between structural subunits, and the mechanisms for residual stress relaxation with OA/PEA treatment are illustrated in Fig. 9b. Although both cations possess a similar number of carbon atoms, OA is more flexible compared to PEA, which is stiff due to presence of a benzene ring. The incorporation of large organic cations at the perovskite interfaces induced additional structural flexibility against lattice distortion. They further fabricated photovoltaic devices using residual stress-reduced perovskite films and evaluated the performance of these PSC devices. Among the PSC devices with residual stress relaxation, OAI with a concentration of 10 × 10−3 M achieved the best performance with the optimal average PCE (and PCEmax) is 19.37% (21.48%), as presented in Fig. 9c. The champion device (O-10) with a PCE of 21.48% exhibited an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.183 V, short-circuit current (JSC) of 23.66 mA cm−2, and fill factor of 76.74%. The histogram in Fig. 9d shows the reproducibility and further verifies the PCE enhancement.

Mater., 2019, ©John Wiley & Sons. 
Similarly, several other efforts have also been made to release residual tensile stress (strain) in both inverted and non-inverted PSCs caused by thermal effects, lattice distortions, defects, lattice mismatch, etc. The strategies to eliminate the residual stress at the lattice surfaces and interfaces include external compressive strain, use of buffer layers to alleviate the perovskite/substrate lattice mismatch, low-temperature perovskite conversion, and post-treatment approach using organic components to reduce the surface stress; however, the PCE did not improved significantly in these works, remaining at <20%.71–73
2.3 Utilizing different hole transport layers (HTLs)
Despite all the improvements in inverted (p–i–n) PSCs, their top performance is still lagging behind that of regular (n–i–p) PSCs because of the relatively larger VOC loss of the former. The lower VOC is primarily caused by the NRR losses within the perovskite bulk or/and at its interface with the ETLs and HTLs. The HTL plays a key role in the charge collection at the interface and perovskite crystal growth, and thereby it is urgent to develop HTLs for high PCE inverted (p–i–n) PSCs. Generally, three types of HTLs are employed in PSCs, i.e., inorganic HTLs, polymeric HTLs, and organic small molecule HTLs (SM-HTLs). Inorganic HTLs usually exhibit better device stability; however, they yield a lower PCE owing to their relatively poor intrinsic surface defects and conductivity. Polymeric HTLs produce superior surface morphology but with poorer reproducibility and stability in high PCE devices.74
Compared to inorganic HTLs, organic HTLs exhibit unique features, for instance, flexibility, solution processing at low temperatures, and streamlined regulation of their electrical and structural properties. Poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) is the most employed HTL in the highest PCE inverted (p–i–n) PSCs. However, p-type doping or extra surface treatment is vital for highly efficient devices, which is ascribed to its hydrophobic properties and low hole mobility. Similarly, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is another widely used HTL. However, the inherent acidity of PEDOT:PSS is known to have a direct effect on the stability of the device, resulting in poor stability. Furthermore, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of PEDOT:PSS is not well matched with that of perovskite, which requires a revamp of the HTL design. The high HOMO level of HTLs incites large energy offsets, which cause interfacial obstacles for hole extraction, leading to severe loss in VOC. Wan et al.59 utilized dopant-free HTLs such as PFDT-COOH and PFDT-2F-COOH, which yielded a PCE of 20.64% and 21.68%, respectively. The molecular structure of PFDT-COOH and PFDT-2F-COOH, the device architecture, and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. 10a. The stability test of the unencapsulated devices employing PFDT-COOH and PFDT-2F-COOH under continuous illumination for 500 h showed that both devices maintained >85% of their initial PCE, as depicted in Fig. 10b. Moreover, their thermal stability was investigated in an N2 atmosphere (85 °C), as shown in Fig. 10c, where both devices maintained >80% of their initial PCE after 720 h. Using the intramolecular noncovalent interaction approach, Yang et al.75 employed two novel small-molecular dopant-free HTLs referred to as BTORA and BTORCNA. The HTL based on BTORCNA showed superior hole mobility, favorable energy band alignment, and desirable surface properties, delivering a PCE of 21.10% and better long-term stability. The J–V curves and structure of the device are shown in Fig. 10d. This is one of the highest PCE, outperforming that of the BTORA-based devices (18.40%), reported for a dopant-free HTL in an inverted (p–i–n) PSC. Similarly, Liao et al.,76 synthesized a series of donor–acceptor (D–A) self-assembled molecules named MPA-BT-CA, MPA-BT-BA, and MPA-BT-RA and employed them as HTLs in inverted PSCs, where MPA is 4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-phenylaniline, BT is benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole, CA is 2-cyanoacrylic acid, BA is benzoic acid, and RA is rhodanine-3-propionic acid. The device based on MPA-BT-CA HTL delivered a PCE of 21.81% (Fig. 10e).

Similarly, Wang et al.57 used novel donor–acceptor-type small molecule dopant-free HTLs named MPA-BTI and MPA-BTTI in inverted PSCs. The HTL based on the small molecule MPA-BTTI delivered an exceptional performance with a PCE of 21.17% (Fig. 10f) and outperformed the device based on the small molecule MPA-BTI (17.20%). The HTL based on the small molecule MPA-BTTI showed a superior stable performance in an inert environment compared to the NiOx- and PTAA-based HTL devices (Fig. 10g). Moreover, the device based on MPA-BTTI kept 90% of its initial PCE under constant illumination for 500 h (Fig. 10h).
Zhang et al.77 employed different HTLs named hydrophilic polymer PEDOT:PSS, inorganic NiOx, hydrophobic polymer PTAA, and small organic molecule MeO-2PACz in inverted (p–i–n) PSCs. Using a single-step spin coating approach, the authors fabricated an MACl-assisted black-phase FAPbI3 (αFAPbI3) perovskite layer on the four different HTLs. It was shown that MeO-2PACz was the optimal substrate for stabilizing αFAPbI3, yielding a superior photovoltaic performance among four HTLs. The lower VOC of the device was further improved with the help of an efficient passivation strategy by introducing excess PbI2 in the precursor solution. A schematic of the inverted PSC is depicted in Fig. 11a, where the magnification shows the chemical structure of the four HTLs in the right panel. The PL and TRPL spectroscopy analysis showed that the electrode based on FAPbI3 with an additional 5 mol% excess of PbI2 resulted in a 16 times higher peak than that of the pure FAPbI3-based electrode, validating that the NRR was significantly suppressed in the surface-passivated device. The TRPL curve (Fig. 11b) shows that the lifetime for FAPbI3 with an additional 5 mol% of PbI2 was 261 ns, which was much longer than that of the pure FAPbI3 (97.5 ns). The improved charge carrier lifetime revealed that the NRR and defect passivation were significantly suppressed in the FAPbI3 with 5 mol% of excess PbI2. The J–V cures of the champion device scanned in both directions are shown in Fig. 11c, where the VOC is ∼1.12 V, JSC is ∼24.83 mA cm−2, and FF is ∼79.08%, yielding a PCE of 22.13%. It can be observed that the device showed no hysteresis and resulted in the same photovoltaic parameters when scanned in both directions. The stability test of the device based on FAPbI3 (control and with 5 mol% excess PbI2) was performed in the ambient environment with a relative humidity of 50% ± 5% at room temperature. Fig. 11d shows that the device based on FAPbI3 with an excess of 5 mol% PbI2 maintained 92% of the initial PCE after 800 h, whereas the device based on pure FAPbI3 lost 60% of its initial value after just 200 h.

Similarly, Lian et al.78 employed inorganic HTL NiOx synthesized by the process of UV irradiation (UV-NiOx) and compared its performance with the NiOx HTL synthesized at high temperature (HT-NiOx). A schematic illustration of the fabricated inverted PSC based on UV-NiOx is shown in Fig. 11e. The J–V curves of the inverted PSCs fabricated based on UV-NiOx and HT-NiOx HTLs are compared in Fig. 11f, where the former delivered a PCE of 22.45% compared to 19.79% for the latter. The PL spectra showed that perovskite-UV-NiOx-quartz had higher quenching than perovskite-HT-NiOx-quartz, revealing improved charge transfer through the perovskite/HTL interface. The TRPL spectra (Fig. 11g) showed that the carrier lifetime of the perovskite film was reduced from 1956.69 ns (perovskite) to 985.43 ns (HT-NiOx) and 797.86 ns (UV-NiOx).
2.4 Utilizing different electron transport layers (ETLs)
Thus far, the most widely employed back contact electron extraction is C60-based materials. Hu et al.63 employed one-dimensional cation (Co or Fe)-doped brookite TiO2 nanorod (NR) together with C60 as the top cathode in an inverted (p–i–n) PSC. In the TiO2 nanorod network, the embedded 0D C60 could fill the interstitial space and make its capping more condensed to enhance the charge contacts and protect the perovskite from the environment. The inverted (p–i–n) PSC showed an enhanced performance with a PCE of around 22%. A schematic illustration of the fabricated inverted (p–i–n) device is depicted in Fig. 12a. The steady-state PL spectra of the pristine perovskite and perovskite coated with ETLs are shown in Fig. 12b. The pure perovskite showed a high PL intensity with a peak at ∼775 nm, whereas the perovskite coated with the ETL (C60) showed a significant decrease in PL intensity, revealing superior charge extraction. Moreover, an additional layer of (Co or Fe)-doped brookite TiO2 further decreased the PL intensity, suggesting a more efficient charge extraction at the interface. Fig. 12c displays the comparison of the J–V curves employing different ETLs (C60, C60:TiO2 NRs, C60:Fe-TiO2 NR, and C60:Co-TiO2 NRs). The devices based on C60: Fe-TiO2 NR and C60: Co-TiO2 NR showed a significant enhancement in performance owing to their better energy level alignments with the (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 perovskite and its superior charge extraction properties. In addition, the higher electron mobility of the C60:Fe or Co-TiO2 ETL ensured efficient charge transfer and suppressed charge recombination losses at the cathode side, resulting in a higher FF comparatively. Fig. 12d shows the J–V curves of the best-inverted (p–i–n) device based on C60: Co-TiO2 NR with small variations in the reverse and forward scans. Finally, the long-term stability of the champion device based on C60:Co-TiO2 ETL vs. pure C60 ETL was investigated, as shown in Fig. 12e. The device based on the pristine C60 ETL exhibited a sharp drop in PCE from 17.1% to 14.4% within the first 7 days, which decreased to 0 just after one month. Alternatively, it can be seen that the device based on the C60:Co-TiO2 ETL exhibited an excellent performance and maintained a PCE of 21.5% even after about three months. This achievement indicated a significant improvement in the durability of the inverted (p–i–n) PSCs with enhanced shelf life and high PCE. The devices with a PCE greater than 20% using different passivators, HTLs, ETLs and interfacial engineering together with their stability and other parameters are listed in Table 1.

2.5 Adaptation of unique perovskite combinations
Most perovskite light absorber films are polycrystalline, which possess defect densities and short charge carrier diffusion lengths. In comparison, single perovskite layer films possess longer diffusion lengths and fewer defect densities.79 For PSCs to reach their full potential, their spectral response needed to be extended towards the near-infrared region to approach the ideal single-junction solar cell bandgap range of 1.1 to 1.4 eV. The best single-junction solar cells based on single-crystal gallium arsenide with a bandgap of 1.4 eV yielded a PCE of 29.1% (GaAs, Z = 29.1%).80 Recently, a very high PCE of 22.8% was achieved by employing a single crystal of mixed perovskite in inverted (p–i–n) PSCs.81 The enhancement in PCE in the single-crystal mixed perovskite FA0.6MA0.4PbI3 compared to MAPbI3 can be seen by looking closely at the external quantum efficiency of the respective devices (Fig. 13a). These single crystal perovskites possess lower defect densities than the polycrystalline perovskite films, thereby inducing long charge carrier diffusion lengths in the former. A redshift of ∼30 nm was observed at the band edge owing to the decrease in the bandgap of FA0.6MA0.4PbI3 compared to MAPbI3, resulting in a 2 mA cm−2 jump from the integrated JSC. This jump in the integrated JSC led to a lower bandgap, resulting in a decrease in VOC, which was not the case for the FA0.6MA0.4PbI3-based device (Fig. 13b). A schematic illustration of the inverted (p–i–n) PSC is shown in Fig. 13c. The J–V curves of the champion device based on FA0.6MA0.4PbI3 is illustrated in Fig. 13d, exhibiting negligible hysteresis with a maximum PCE of 22.8%.

2.5.1 The perovskite material selection. 
In most of the champion inverted (p–i–n) PSCs, mixed cation metal halide perovskites have been used as an absorber layer.63,81 Besides the mixed cation perovskite approach, the treatment of the metal halide perovskite surface with some organic cations such as phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl), PEACl:PbCl2, and benzenebutanammonium iodide (PBAI)41 was performed to get the Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite structure,28 resulting in the synergistic effect of removing the surface defects by surface passivation and GB passivation and optimizing the tolerance factor of the perovskite crystal. The optimized surfaces showed good stability against thermal treatment and moisture.

3. Conclusions
In this review, we discussed the various inverted (p–i–n) PSC perspectives and future challenges. Despite the rapid breakthroughs in methylammonium metal halide-based solar cells (PSCs), there are still serious concerns and challenges for their mass production and commercialization. For instance, the lack of low-temperature annealing protocols for different active layers and their unstable nature cause severe concerns regarding this technology. Inverted PSCs have received great attention owing to their simple fabrication process and architecture, which are beneficial for application in large-scale flexible and tandem devices. Currently, inverted PSCs lag in power conversion efficiency (PCE) (around 24%) compared to regular devices (reaching 26%). The lower PCE of the inverted PSCs is due to their poor open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). The defects present on the perovskite surface and at the perovskite/HTL and ETL/perovskite interfaces result in a lower VOC and FF, where HTL is hole transport layer and ETL is electron transprot layer. To address these challenges, for instance, various strategies have been proposed to improve the stability and the overall device performance such as (i) interface engineering, (ii) passivation of surfaces and grain boundaries, (iii) defect encapsulation, (iv) elimination of residual stress at the surface and interfaces, (v) utilizing different ETLs, (vi) utilizing different HTLs, and (vii) adaptation of unique perovskite combinations including the smart selection of perovskite materials. The inverted (p–i–n) PSCs have already shown improved stability over conventional (n–i–p) PSCs; however, their low PCE needs further attention from the scientific community to expedite their lab-to-industry transition.
