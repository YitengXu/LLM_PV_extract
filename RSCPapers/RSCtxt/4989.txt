    , Accepted 6th December 2019First published on 6th December 2019AbstractLithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) are considered to be promising candidates for use as energy storage systems owing to their high theoretical capacity and high energy density compared with high-level lithium-ion batteries. Despite these advantages, the commercialization of LSBs has been obstructed by certain deficiencies, such as the shuttle effect and poor conductivity of sulfur. On one hand, the chemical interactions between polar materials and lithium polysulfides (LPSs) have been investigated by researchers, particularly related to the shuttle effect.

1. Introduction
Since the 1970s, because of the invention of electric motors and generators, electrical energy has gradually become the most important secondary energy source for humankind.1 Fuel-burning, wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, tidal, and bioelectric power systems have become major sources of electricity. Over the past decade, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become the dominant energy storage devices. In the recent years, the highest energy density of LIBs has reached close to its theoretical value of about 420 W h kg−1, which seriously limits their use for next-generation smart devices such as smart grids, electric vehicles, portable devices, and drones. As one of the most promising next-generation energy storage devices, lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) can output almost fivefold higher energy density (theoretical capacity: 1675 mA h g−1; energy density: 2600 W h kg−1) at one-third the cost when compared with conventional LIBs.2–4
LSBs usually consist of a sulfur cathode, lithium-metal anode, separator, and electrolyte. During discharge, the lithium metal of the anode is reduced to lithium ions and electrons, which then pass through the porous separator and external circuit, respectively, to reach the sulfur cathode. The discharge process can be summarized using the following three general chemical equations:
Overall: S8 + 16Li → 8Li2S
Cathode: S8 + 16e− + 16Li → 8Li2S
Anode: Li → e− + Li+
However, from a microscopic point of view, the discharge process of a sulfur cathode is typically divided into several complicated steps, which are shown in Fig. 1. (1) At about 2.4 V in section 1, solid S8 is reduced to the long-chain S82−, which is soluble in an organic electrolyte. (2) At about 2.4–2.2 V in sections 2 and 3, S82− is reduced to shorter soluble chains of S62− and S42−. (3) In sections 4 and 5, S42− further changes into solid Li2S2 or Li2S at ∼2.2 V, which exhibits 75% capacity for sulfur cathodes (1257 mA h g−1).5–8
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the complicated discharge process of sulfur cathode of LSBs. The detailed discharge process can be summarized as follows: section 1: S8 + 2e− → S82−; section 2: S82− + 2e− → S62−; section 3: S62− + 2e− → S42−; section 4: S42− + 2e− + 2Li+ → 2Li2S2↓; and section 5: Li2S2 + 2e− + 2Li+ → 2Li2S↓. 
Moreover, this process has seriously hindered the commercialization of LSBs; the reasons for this can be summarized as follows: poor conductive nature of sulfur species, large volume change, and dissolution of lithium polysulfides (LPSs).
1.1. Poor conductive nature of sulfur species
Although sulfur experiences two phase changes during the discharge process, it is a constant that both the charge and discharge products of the cathode are solid with poor conductivities of 5 × 10−30 and 10−13 S cm−1, respectively. Such characteristics lead to the following challenges:
(1) Most of the sulfur is melted into the matrix material at the melting point, which causes S8 to accumulate in local areas. Therefore, external sulfur increases the difficulty of internal sulfur to receive electrons and lithium ions, thereby reducing sulfur utilization. A study has shown that even after working for several cycles, S8 is still present, which has never been involved in the electrical cycle;
(2) The discharge products, namely, Li2S2 and Li2S, get precipitated, covering the surface of the matrix such as the carbon material to form a passivation layer, which increases the resistance of LSBs;
(3) Due to the limited dynamics of electrons and lithium ions, common Li–S voltage curves tend to exhibit higher polarization in lower discharge platform voltages, which further leads to a reduction in the actual energy density.9,10
1.2. Dissolution of LPSs
A sulfur cathode can produce Li2Sx (4 ≤ x ≤ 8) dissolved in an organic electrolyte (mainly ether-based electrolytes) during the discharge process, thereby affecting the battery performance.11 Firstly, it should be noted that the presence of such LPSs can also play a role in promoting the efficient performance of LSBs; the reasons for this can be summarized as follows:
(1) In the initial stage of the discharge process, S8 on the surface becomes Li2Sx (4 ≤ x ≤ 8) dissolved in the electrolyte, which can ensure that the internal sulfur particles come fully into contact with the lithium ions in the electrolyte, thereby improving the utilization rate of sulfur;
(2) During the charge process, since residual Li2Sx (4 ≤ x ≤ 8) still exists in the electrolyte, they are in equilibrium with the insulating Li2S (Li2S + S62− → S42−), which can promote its oxidation;
(3) Because of the presence of soluble Li2Sx (4 ≤ x ≤ 8), the LSBs exhibit lower internal resistance and higher output voltage than those provided by solid sulfur alone.
However, every coin has two sides. The dissolution of LPSs poses more challenges for obtaining high-performance LSBs, which can be summarized as follows:
(1) When sulfur dissolves in the electrolyte, it loses contact with the matrix material, which makes it more difficult to obtain electrons in the subsequent discharge process, thereby reducing the kinetics of the reaction;
(2) A portion of LPSs dissolves in the organic electrolyte and then passes through the separator under the pressure of the concentration gradient force to reach the lithium-metal anode to form Li2S, which causes an irreversible loss of active material. Meanwhile, it can passivate and corrode the lithium-metal anode;
(3) The remaining portion of the LPSs passes through the separator and is reduced to short-chain soluble LPSs, which come back and reoxidize into long-chain LPSs under the action of the electric field. This is referred to as the notorious “shuttle effect,” which not only reduces the coulombic efficiency, but also directly shortens the sulfur utilization, resulting in serious capacity decay.
1.3. Large volume changes
The crystal density of S8 (2.07 g cm−3) is higher than that of Li2S (1.66 g cm−3); therefore, there is a tremendous volume variation of ∼80% during a complete charge and discharge process. Therefore, if the matrix material has limited space and high rigidity, it is likely to cause pulverization of the matrix material during cycling when sulfur is almost completely filled in the matrix material.12 This pulverization not only destroys the structural integrity, but also reduces the performance of the constraint of sulfur and conductivity of material, resulting in a decrease in the coulombic efficiency of the battery as well as a rapid decay of capacity.13
As shown in Fig. 2, to ensure that sulfur can fully contact lithium ions and electrons, two aspects need to be investigated: (1) nonpolar materials can transport current and (2) polar materials can fix sulfur.14 The first part focuses on resolving a series of side reactions caused by LPSs dissolution, while the second part focuses on resolving the challenge of poor conductivity of sulfur species.15 Excessive sulfur loading can also lead to a low utilization rate of sulfur in the battery, because the volume expansion of sulfur in the electrochemical reaction causes the host material to collapse and the adsorption effect on LPSs is reduced, eventually resulting in a rapid capacity decline of the battery. Therefore, in the design of sulfur host materials, not only the conductivity and the adsorption effect on LPSs, but also the volume change of sulfur should be considered to properly control the sulfur loading.16
 Fig. 2  Schematic of the classification of polar and nonpolar materials for LSBs. 
Therefore, a reasonable combination between them can improve the performance of LSBs. However, carbon materials, polar materials, and their mixtures have been frequently summarized, but few reviews have provided their comprehensive elaboration and detailed classification, making it difficult to find a reasonable combinatory design of these materials and methods to obtained them.17,18 Herein, we have summarized various host materials for use as sulfur cathodes from the perspective of comprehensively resolving the poor conductivity and shuttle effect. We hope that this review can provide newer ideas to researchers and promote the application of sulfur cathode materials.
2. Polar materials
There are several advantages of using polar materials in LSBs. Firstly, polar materials comprise various polar anions that exhibit worthwhile binding energy with LPSs. When compared with porous carbon materials, polar materials offer numerous active sites for the adsorption of LPSs. However, as a host of sulfur, certain types of polar materials do not exhibit considerable conductivity. Therefore, several works that involve combining polar materials with conducting materials have been reported. Secondly, under a relatively large potential window, certain polar materials can participate in the electrochemical reaction process in LSBs. Hence, the volumetric energy density of cells can be remarkably enhanced by fabricating polar materials and sulfur composites. Thirdly, certain types of chemical compounds have shown significant electrical conductivity and ionic conductivity. This could be used to construct a multifunctional cathode material, where sulfur is the host and conductive and fixed LPSs resolve the shuttle effect.
Herein, the hosts of sulfur were categorized according to their compositions, namely, transition metal oxides (TMOs), transition metal sulfides (TMSs), transition metal carbides (TMCs), transition metal nitrides (TMNs), transition metal hydroxides (TMHs), metal elements, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and polymers.
2.1. TMOs
Due to the presence of O2−, TMOs have always possessed strong polar surfaces. The strong combination of metal and oxygen ensures that the material remains stable in most electrolytes. Nowadays, many types of nonconductive oxides have been introduced into cathodes as a polar additive, which contain a large amount of active sites for combining with LPSs. By combining high-density nonconductive oxides with sulfur, the volumetric energy can be significantly improved. Other TMOs have exhibited worthwhile electrical conductivity due to special defects or structures, which could be directly used for LSBs. In addition, TMOs were also equipped with a separator to be a functional screen between the sulfur cathode and lithium anode for promoting the conversion of sulfur and LPSs.

2.1.1 Ti-based oxides. 
TiO2. 
TiO2 is a type of natural titanium-based oxide. It can be extracted from anatase (α-TiO2), rutile (β-TiO2), brookite (γ-TiO2), and black TiO2.19 Despite the fact that the conductivities of these TiO2 compounds were within ∼10−4–10−5 S cm−1, due to their polar surface and high chemical absorption ability, TiO2 compounds have been widely used in LSBs as the hosts of sulfur. For instance, LSBs containing TiO2 with 5 nm pores yielded capacity retention that was 37% higher after 100 cycles than that of LSBs without TiO2 addition. In the Raman spectra of α-TiO2, when LPSs were added, the two peaks at 395 and 525 cm−1 shift to 410 and 515 cm−1, which was a confirmation of the adsorption of TiO2 on LPSs.20 According to the work of Yuan et al., the energy for adsorbing Sn2− can be calculated asEad (S42−) = Etot (S42−/slab) − [Etot (S42−) + Etot (slab)]where Etot (S42−/slab) denotes the energy of the slab with absorbed S42−; further, Etot (S42−) and Etot (slab) were the total energies of the corresponding free S42− and bare slabs, respectively. Hence, the binding energies of Li2S to α-TiO2 (101) and β-TiO2 (110) were 3.59 and 3.62 eV, respectively.21 Here, we categorized TiO2 composites in terms of dimensionality, function, and source.
TiO2 has been used as the host of sulfur and designed into all types of dimensionalities. Jiang et al. reported a hierarchical anatase TiO2 spherical structure with a polar surface acting as the medium for binding LPSs, which yielded a sulfur delivering capacity of about 928 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at a current density of 200 mA g−1.22 As shown in Fig. 3a, TiO2 materials of various structures exhibited different ways of fixing with LPSs. Typically, 2D exfoliated TiO2 nanosheets having Lewis acidity with high sulfur load of 80 wt% and excellent LSB performance were reported to markedly limit the dissolution of LPSs. The as-prepared LSBs showed a capacity of 1024 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, retaining a capacity of 82.3% at 1000 mA g−1 after 300 cycles.23 Further, a 3D titanium-based oxide/graphene aerogel possessed a graded porous structure and exhibited a good adsorption effect on long-chain LPSs during charge and discharge, as shown in Fig. 3b. A composite with 15.3 wt% TiO2 exhibit splendid electrochemical performance. The high utilization of sulfur was achieved by adding glucose to modify the pore diameter distribution, which exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 1011 mA h g−1 at 2C together with a coulombic efficiency of 100% after 500 cycles.24

In addition, TiO2 could be assembled with conductive graphene, confining sulfur and chemical adsorbents for LPSs. Mesoporous TiO2 was fabricated in situ on reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which was reported by Kaifu Huo. This TiO2/rGO hybrid could load 72 wt% sulfur. In this typical hybrid, TiO2 exhibited effective chemisorption of LPSs, while rGO showed excellent electronic conductivity.25 We reported a hollow carbon (HC) sphere and TiO2 composites synthesized by a modified template method. The as-composited HC–TiO2/S cathode yielded a specific capacity of 671 mA h g−1 over 300 cycles and capacity retention remained 93% with 67 wt% sulfur.26 The self-assembly in an alkaline solution with a tubular TiO2/rGO composite yielded a specific capacity of 1200 mA h g−1 at 0.1 and 0.2C.27 As shown in Fig. 3c, a sandwich-type C/TiO2/C microsphere was designed as the sulfur host, which yielded a specific capacity of 1247 mA h g−1 at 2C with 76.4 wt% sulfur.28 Further, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could provide an optional conductive system for porous TiO2. Webbed CNTs and a functional carbon-paper interlayer have been used in synergy with TiO2. A conductive interlayer could restrain the shuttle effect and enhance the life span of the battery.29–31 This typical structure improved the LSB performance at high rates (e.g., 1, 2, and 5C).32 TiO2 tubes formed by a two-step anodization method could be equipped with polypyrrole (PPy) as a conductive material to become a coaxial heterogeneous structure. The designed S/PPy/TiO2 ordered nanotubes as the cathode yielded a capacity of 1150 mA h g−1. It was interesting that the capacity increased after 100 cycles at 0.1C. The authors attributed this to the fact that PPy grabbed polystyrene (PS) in the solution during the synthesis as well as the catalytic action of PS on sulfur and LPS conversion.33 Recently, Sun and his co-workers designed CNTs threading mesoporous TiO2 as the cathode material by the vacuum filtration method. Superb surface contact could be achieved by the crossed structure between TiO2 and CNTs, which provided a low capacity decline of 0.07% per cycle at 0.5C after 500 cycles.34 With regard to TiO2 sources, modified TiO2 nanoparticles decomposed from tetraethoxysilane have also been reported. Typically, an N-doped mesoporous TiO2/carbon microsphere was obtained from outdated milk.35
Recently, the heterostructure has been widely used for improving the electrical conductivity of cathode materials. A twinborn TiO2–TiN heterostructure combined the advantages of TiO2 (high adsorption) and TiN (high conductivity), which promoted the transfer process between LPSs and sulfur. The synergistic effect of twinborn TiO2–TiN heterojunction structure yielded high trapping efficiency, facile diffusion, and fast conversion. This heterostructure loaded onto graphene was reported by Yang et al.; they fabricated LSBs with ultralong life with 73% capacity retention at 1C after 2000 cycles.36 A TiO–TiO2 heterostructure/PPy was designed by Yang et al., which exhibited significant ability to capture LPSs by the Lewis acid–base interactions and conductivity. External PPy could hinder the diffusion of LPSs. A cathode made from this material yielded impressive capacities of 1130, 990, 932, 862, and 726 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 1C, respectively, as well as a considerable cycle life.37 Herein, we fabricated a TiC–TiO2/S composite that could chemically trap LPSs, which was prepared by a one-step water bath reaction and a melting–diffusion strategy. With the assistance of the synergistic effect of TiC and TiO2, the nonconductivity of sulfur and diffusion of LPSs could be modified. An as-prepared cathode showed an initial discharge capacity of 1218 mA h g−1 at 1C; after 500 cycles, a capacity of 714 mA h g−1 at 0.5C could be retained.38
In addition to the abovementioned details, researchers have also paid attention to mimicking living things. A soft template was used to fabricate bean-pod-like polar TiO2 nanocrystals assembled with a hollow porous carbon host for LSBs, as reported by Wang et al.39 Further novel structures of biomimetic bipolar microcapsules with nonpolar nanofiber on the inside have been reported. As shown in Fig. 3d, polar TiO2 was used to construct a biomimetic shell that allowed lithium ions to migrate while preventing the loss of LPSs. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) on the inside were derived from Staphylococcus aureus, which was used as the host and carrier for sulfur. Meanwhile, a bipolar compound could act as the host of sulfur and conduction, which modified the migration of LPSs at the particle scale. The S. aureus-derived carbon (SDC)/TiO2/S compound yielded an initial specific capacity of 1202 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, maintaining 99.5% coulombic efficiency after 1500 cycles.40
Ti4O7. 
When compared with TiO2 and Ti-based twinborn materials, TinO2n−1 (Magnéli phase) exhibited higher conductivities and stronger binding energies with LPSs due to the O–Ti–O polar bond. As a member of TinO2n−1, Ti4O7 exhibited a strong fixing effect of LPSs, but also yielded better conductivity than TiO2. Different from TiO2, Magnéli-phase Ti4O7 exhibited a sulfiphilic surface, which acted as the polar host for the Li–S conversion reaction.18 Ti4O7 was designed to be a direct host of sulfur; Ti4O7/S cathodes delivered reversible capacities of over 1000 mA h g−1 with 70 wt% sulfur.41 Rachel A. Caruso constructed high-specific-surface-area Ti4O7 microspheres via an in situ carbothermal reduction reaction. With 70 wt% sulfur, this cathode material exhibited discharge capacities of 1317 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and 861 mA h g−1 at 2C.42
When combined with carbon materials for LSBs, a long cycle life could be achieved. It has been reported that ultrafine Ti4O7 nanoparticles embedded into carbon exhibit significant stability at 4C after 1000 cycles with sulfur loading of 15.6 mg cm−2. In this design, the space inside a Ti4O7/carbon composite facilitated the fixing effect.43 Freestanding and flexible Ti4O7 decorated on a 3D carbon network was constructed by Qiu et al. The final product was produced by electrospinning and in situ carbonization. The as-prepared Ti4O7/C nanofibers could function as multifunctional interlayers of separators, which yield batteries with long cycle life with electric conductivity in the range of 3–30 S cm−1. Using such multifunctional separators, the cell yielded low capacity fading of 0.03% per cycle after 2500 cycles at 3C when using a CMK-3/S cathode.44 Generally, Ti4O7 is fabricated by reducing TiO2 at around 1000 °C with Ar gas and carbon. This method makes it difficult to control the pores and structures of Ti4O7 particles. Therefore, developing certain methods to control their size and construction is a promising direction. Porous Ti4O7 particles with interconnected structures have been constructed by Lu et al., which were further coated with carbon material derived from polydopamine. Fig. 4a shows a typical structure. The size and structure of the interconnected construction could be modified by adjusting the swelling time of the templates.45

2.1.2 Mn-based oxides. 
MnO2 has been used as an auxiliary agent in conductive materials (e.g., carbon materials) to assist in the fixation of LPSs, and it has been sometimes used as the main body of cathodes. Among MnO2 for LSBs, it has been found that δ-MnO2 is a promising host of sulfur and fixer for LPSs by converting thiosulfate into polythionate; this was initially developed by Nazar et al.46 Further, MnO2 has a variety of different crystal forms, such as α-, β-, γ-, δ-, ε-, and λ-MnO2. Among them, γ-MnO2 yields worthwhile electrochemical/chemical properties that are suitable for battery applications.47,48 MnO2 has been fabricated into structures of various dimensions such as 0D (sphere),49 1D (tubes50 or fibers),51 and 3D (cross-linked structures).52
Several studies have discussed the use of MnO2 as a 0D material and have comprehensively investigated its function in LSBs. Multiple strategies to combine supplementary materials of MnO2 with conductive materials as the hosts of cathode for LSBs have been continually reported. For instance, in conventional thermal melting treatments, sulfur cannot fully diffuse into the inner matrix of the materials; therefore, the shuttle effect would inevitably occur. In order to overcome this deficiency of traditional vapor sulfur, Zhu et al. prepared a cathode material by the redox method; consequently, sulfur could be completely coated by MnO2 and carbon. This structure is described in Fig. 4b. The fabricated cathode delivered an initial specific discharge capacity of 1149 mA h g−1.53 An effective method to decorate MnO2 onto a pistachio-shell-derived sustainable carbon (PC) scaffold was proposed by Vilas G. Pol et al. Here, PC acted as a container of sulfur due to its interconnected channels and abundant micropores. The cycling performance of MnO2-added cathode was better than a PC/S cathode after 250 cycles.54 It has been reported that poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) can be used as a protective layer to prevent the dissolution of LPSs with good electron transport (550 S cm−1). However, the low contact area and poor wettability with the electrolyte resulted in the polymer failing to fully extract the electrochemical advantages. In view of these shortcomings, Su and co-workers synthesized MnO2-nanosheets-modified PEDOT for use as the host of sulfur in LSBs. Due to the action of lithium ions and MnO2, a multishell structure was formed during the activation process, which protected the easy loss of internal sulfur and LPSs. More importantly, the Mn–O groups enhanced the fixing effect with LPSs.55 Another special 0D spherical structure is called the core–shell sphere. This sphere comprising conductive materials composited with MnO2 has been widely used in LSBs. For instance, Diao et al. designed a double core–shell S/C/MnO2 nanosphere as the cathode material, which yielded a high specific capacity of 1345 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. The typical structure could reserve sulfur by means of the conductive carbon layer inside and polar δ-MnO2 shell outside. The MnO2 transformed into Mn3O4, while the LPSs transformed into polythionate because of the oxidation of LPSs and δ-MnO2 shell, which promoted the discharge process.49 Similarly, MnO2–GO double-shell sulfur has been reported to exhibit excellent pores to hold sulfur, as shown in Fig. 4c. Chen et al. reduced KMnO4 with sulfur; therefore, MnO2 was coated onto the surface of sulfur in situ. Then, S/MnO2 was assembled with GO. MnO2 effectively protects sulfur and LPSs in the electrode from direct loss by contact, while the surface-rich voids provided relief for the increase in sulfur during volume expansion.56 Nazar et al. reported the synthesis of scalable core–shell sulfur–MnO2 composite cathodes via the in situ reactive assembly, which delivered a fading rate of 0.039% per cycle after 1700 cycles and 0.048% per cycle after 800 cycles at 2C in LSBs.57 As shown in Fig. 4d, MnO2 nanosheets grown on both the internal and external surfaces of N-doped hollow porous carbon nanospheres (NHCSs/MnO2) were reported by Wu et al. Nitrogen doping and MnO2 nanosheets enhanced the adsorption of LPSs.58 With regard to 1D materials, many coaxial carbon-/manganese-based oxide complexes have been reported.50,59–61 For instance, with a large hollow space and ample hierarchical pores, nitrogen-doped carbon/MnO coaxial nanotubes could load 75 wt% sulfur, as shown in Fig. 4e. When combined with sulfur, it yielded a specific capacity of 802 mA h g−1 at 5C and capacity retention of 82% over 520 cycles at 1C.61 Hollow CNFs filled with MnO2 nanosheets could be used as a sulfur host for LSBs, as reported by Lou. Initially, MnO2 was used as the template by combining with SiO2 and then it was coated with resorcinol formaldehyde; after sintering and etching, MnO2 remained in the CNFs. The resulting structure was a 1D nanostructure of carbon material coated onto MnO2 nanosheets, which could hold 71 wt% sulfur. MnO2/hollow CNFs/S delivered a specific capacity of 1161 mA h g−1 at 0.05C.51 Researchers have also proposed the 3D construction of sulfur hosts. For example, a 3D porous rGO/ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets–S aerogels compound formed via a solvothermal reaction exhibited stable electrochemical performance, as reported by Wang. In particular, this material could be directly assembled into a battery without the need of a conductive agent or bonding agent. In this typical method, rGO acted as the backbone to provide a network for electron conduction. Polar ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets acted as the fixers for LPSs resulting in chemisorption (and therefore resolving the shuttle effect) and nanosulfur acted as an active substance to store energy. It delivered an initial capacity of 1360 mA h g−1 at 0.1C.62 As shown in Fig. 4f, Hou et al. reported a method to sacrifice SiO2 for the synthesis of MnO2/HC nanoboxes (MnO2/HCBs) in order to achieve the effect of immobilizing LPSs using synergistic effects. In such nanoboxes, MnO2 nanosheets restricted the diffusion of LPSs by chemisorption. HC nanocages not only provided space for sulfur, but also provided additional space for the volume expansion of sulfur during lithiation. Therefore, MnO2/HCB/S nanoboxes with over 67 wt% sulfur delivered a specific capacity of 1042 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 with coulombic efficiency of about 100%.63 Further, 3D spongy nanoflakes with the hierarchical structure of Ni foam/graphene/CNTs/MnO2 (NGCM) were prepared by Ma et al. for long-life LSBs. In this structure, CNTs were uniformly grown on nickel foam, while the surface was also modified with MnO2. Nickel foam, graphene, and CNTs formed a 3D conductive network skeleton and the MnO2 layer provided adsorption sites for LPSs during cycling. Even at 3C, NGCM/S could yield a discharge capacity of 593 mA h g−1.52
Typically, due to the strong chemical interaction and catalysis of LPSs, MnO2 could be synthesized as a thin coating layer fixed on a polyethylene (PE) separator by the self-assembly method; the catalytic effect and compactness thus achieved could weaken the shuttle effect. In addition, the oxygen-containing group on the surface of the PE film allowed MnO2 to be stably fixed onto the formed surface. Under this assembly method, the MnO2 layer could become ultrathin (380 nm, 0.014 mg cm−2); therefore, it had a marginal influence on the energy density of the battery and shuttling of lithium ions. In terms of performance, LSBs using this diaphragm exhibited capacities of 1345 and 689 mA h g−1 at 0.1 and 3C, respectively.64


2.1.3 Al-based oxides. 
γ-Al2O3 is frequently introduced into LSBs due to its absorbing ability, while the presence of abundant channels provides transport paths to lithium ions as well as storage sites for the electrolyte during the redox reaction. That is, the absorbent capacity and porous structure became critical factors for improving the electrochemical properties of LSBs.
Al2O3 has often been used for atomic layer deposition (ALD) and it has been bonded to active materials for the immobilization of LPSs. Al growth can be controlled by repeated deposition processes. However, since Al2O3 is inactive and it acts as an insulator, an extremely thick layer of Al2O3 can prove to be detrimental to the passage of lithium ions, ultimately affecting the battery capacity. Therefore, it is imperative to study the deposition of Al2O3 in ultrathin atomic layers. The sulfur fixation mode of the monoatomic layer of Al2O3 is shown in Fig. 5a.65 Gleb Yushin coated sulfur with ultrathin Al2O3via a plasma-enhanced ALD process, which delivered a high specific capacity of 600 mA h g−1 at 0.2C after 300 cycles.65 Further, in order to enhance the conductivity of the system, Shi and his colleagues combined graphene and sulfur and successfully covered the composite with an ultrathin Al2O3 film. The ALD-Al2O3-coated G–S composite cathode delivered a specific capacity of 646 mA h g−1 at 0.5C.66 When compared with a half-cell without ALD-Al2O3, the ultrathin Al2O3 layer increased the battery discharge capacity by 25% at the first cycle and from 907 to 1136 and 358 to 766 mA h g−1 on the 40th cycle. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) data revealed that ALD-Al2O3-coated carbon cloth absorbed more sulfur from the electrode.67 Coating porous carbon with ALD-Al2O3 is a very promising method when applying as the host of sulfur. Subsequently, ultrathin Al2O3 films coated on a composite of 3D graphene oxide sponge (GS) and Li2S has been reported. In this system, the lithium–oxygen bond enhanced the absorption of long-chain LPSs, ensuring that the capacity was not lost, as well as yielding a stable cathode. Further, Al2O3–Li2S–GS cathodes delivered a reversible capacity of 736 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, which was much higher than that of the cathode without Al2O3. In typical cathodes, Al2O3 acts as a barrier for Li2S and provides binding energy to fix long-chain LPSs.68 The low-temperature ALD of Al2O3 on sulfur has been reported by Jeffrey W. Elam, which improved the sustainable capacity and coulombic efficiency of LSBs. By ball milling, micron-scale sulfur changed into a nanosized powder, which was then coated by ALD-Al2O3 at a low temperature. These two methods improved both sulfur content and fixing effect of LPSs. Consequently, these methods improved the specific capacity and coulombic efficiency.69 Tian et al. modified a sulfur cathode by using a bifunctional Nafion/γ-Al2O3 membrane, yielding high initial discharge capacities of 1448 and 788 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 1C. γ-Al2O3 was introduced as the absorber of LPSs to improve the electrochemical performance during cycling and abundant channels for Li ions to pass through were provided by the porous structure. Further, the electrochemical performance could be improved by modifying the content of γ-Al2O3.70

2.1.4 Mo-based oxides. 
MoO2—an electrically conductive oxide—with bulk conductivity of 190 S cm−1 has been frequently used as a host of sulfur.71 With good cycling stability and worthwhile electronic conductivity, MoO2 has often been used as a cathode material for LSBs. As a polar material, MoO2 not only provides active sites to fix LPSs, but also introduces pathways for electron transfer by the C–O–Mo bond with a combination of graphene. The mechanism of fixed LPSs and electron flow mechanism of Mo-based oxides and a carbon composite are shown in Fig. 5b.72
In Sun's work, a hollow MoO2 sphere composed of nitrogen-doped graphene to form an interlinked structure acted as the host of sulfur, as shown in Fig. 5c. Due to the conductive network, chemical adsorption of N-rGO, and hollow MoO2 sphere, reasonable electrochemical performance of 1468 mA h g−1 at 0.1C could be achieved.72 The framework of porous MoO2 and carbon as the reservoir in LSBs was reported by Wang et al. The morphology after synthesis is shown in Fig. 5d. MoO2 nanoparticles facilitated interfacial charge transfer and fixed the LPSs. Due to the powerful van der Waals forces of the Mo–S and Li–O bonds, the fabricated LSBs delivered an initial specific capacity of 1317 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and a capacity of 65.6% at 1C after 500 cycles.73 MOF-derived mesoporous MoO2 rods coated with graphene could be used as a sulfur host, as proposed by Zhang et al. As shown in Fig. 5e, the microrods exhibited crispy rice-like morphology; it was fabricated with graphene and S was loaded after annealing. The S/MoO2/graphene cathode yielded a long cycling life with low capacity fading of 0.02% after 3200 cycles at 3C.74
During the discharge process, the bond of Li2Sn–MoO3 helped to inhibit the shuttle effect. The Mo atoms in MoO3 contacted with LPS. With a decrease in the charge transfer resistance, Li passivated the LixMoO3 transfer during the redox reaction. After discharge, the binding energies of Mo 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 shifted from 232.4 and 231.9 eV to 235.5 and 235.0 eV (as per the XPS data), respectively.75
Sn-intercalated belt-like MoO3–S cathodes yielded an initial specific capacity of 1390 mA h g−1 at 0.1C with coulombic efficiency of 99.7%; 79% capacity could be retained over 500 cycles at 1C. By intercalation, additional heteroatoms could be obtained than those obtained by using the doping method. In this work, 2D layered α-MoO3 nanoribbons were chosen to be the host of sulfur; the proportion of elemental Sn was 0.063.76 Li et al. reported woven objects of MoO3 and CNTs interlayer and applied them to LSBs, which provided conducting channels for ions and electrons, yielding high performance. As a result, the LSBs with MoO3/CNT exhibited a capacity of 1251 and 655 mA h g−1 at 0.3 and 3C, respectively. After 200 cycles at 0.3C, the battery still showed a capacity of 755 mA h g−1.77 Li-passivated MoO3 nanobelts decorated on a polypropylene separator was reported by Chu et al. There were two important reactions in this system: (1) lithium ions reacted with MoO3 to become LixMoO3 and (2) Mo atoms in MoO3 formed a chemical bond with LPSs. The ultralong life of LSBs could be attained by using this special separator. The as-prepared cells delivered a high initial capacity at 5C with 29% capacity retention after 5000 cycles.75


2.1.5 Si-based oxides. 
Theoretical simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) revealed that different Li2Sx compounds (x = 1, 2, 4, and 6) were absorbed on SiO2 (002). The absorption energies between Li2S, Li2S2, Li2S4, and Li2S6 and SiO2 were −11.78, −9.51, −11.60, and −10.67 eV, respectively.63
Porous Si embedded on carbon was used as a reservoir for LPSs. The cavities not only accommodated LPSs through the binding energy via the polar surface, but also guaranteed reversible absorption.78 As shown in Fig. 6a, due to the Si/SiO2/C-modified crosslinked structure, the composites not only absorbed LPSs by the physical adsorption capacity, but also restricted negatively charged polysulfides by the electrostatic attraction of positively charged Si/SiO2. The large surface area of such a porous material sufficiently exposed the active sites while facilitating the shuttle of lithium ions, which was advantageous for improving the rate performance. The discharge capacities were 1230, 1002, 907, 730, and 614 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2C, respectively.79 A yolk–shell structure of SiO2 inside a hollow carbon (SiO2/HC) sphere was designed, which combined the advantages of carbon and polar materials, namely, improved conductivity and efficient solution to the shuttle effect. As a result, the SiO2/HC/S electrode exhibited a specific capacity of 1200 mA h g−1 at 0.2C with 76 wt% sulfur.80 Recently, Jiang et al. employed a soft three-layer porous C/SiO2 film (obtained by simple phase inversion) to LSBs. The C/SiO2 film was smooth and had good electrical conductivity, high density, and abundant micropores. The spongy network structure provided continuous electron conduction, overcoming volume expansion and simultaneously fixing sulfur. In addition, the embedded nano-SiO2 particles (∼10 nm) exhibited strong chemisorption toward LPSs. The cathode film could be sheared to a size of 1.6–2.8 mg cm−2, and the maximum area capacitance could be 1.6 mA h cm−2.81 A 3D graded porous graphene/C/SiO2 hollow microsphere was constructed; these microspheres were assembled by interconnecting the carbon layers of silica-modified graphene. This graded porous structure not only ensured structural stability, but also improved the electrical conductivity of the composite against volume expansion. Conductive graphene promoted the rate performance of LSBs. As a result, microsphere/S could deliver a discharge capacity of 1118 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, which contained 20.1 wt% SiO2.82 MOF-modified membranes can form a film with ion-selective permeability. UiO-66-NH2/SiO2 was coated on a Celgard 2320 membrane, which enhanced the thermal stability, moisture resistance, ionic conductivity, compatibility, and charge and discharge properties of the film. In this design, the physicochemical properties of the separator could be balanced. Further, LPSs could be retained by the electrostatic interaction and hydrogen-containing functional groups in UiO-66-NH2, which could improve the performance of LSBs. With regard to the membrane properties, 98.5% of the initial capacity could be retained even after 40 h.83

2.1.6 Sn-based oxides. 
The peak in the infrared spectroscopy data (at 534 cm−1) indicated that the bond (S–Sn–O) assisted in the adsorption of LPSs, which was beneficial to alleviate the shuttle effect.84
SnO2 functioned as a polar material to decorate conductive materials on LSBs and delivered considerably improved performance. As a cathode, it exhibited a discharge plateau below 1.5 V, which was lower than the working voltage of LSBs. Huang et al. further explored the effect of fixing LPSs and found that SnO2 was better as an interlayer material for use in the cathode and separator rather than being used as the host alone.85 Therefore, researchers tended to combine SnO2 with conductive materials or separators. Chen et al. constructed a double-shell SnO2/C hollow nanosphere as a carrier of sulfur. The as-prepared S/SnO2/C composite delivered an initial capacity of 1473 mA h g−1 at a current density of 200 mA g−1.84 The hierarchical porous structure of the material could expose more active sites while ensuring the efficient diffusion of electrolytes and rapid conduction of electrons. Wang et al. reported a composite of graded porous SnO2 nanosheets grown on CNFs for LSBs. The polar SnO2 nanosheet not only exhibited strong chemical adsorption capacity, but also had certain catalytic ability to promote the conversion of LPSs. The conductive network provided by CNFs improved the rate performance of the battery. The hierarchical C/SnO2/S nanosheets material of the electrode delivered a specific capacity of 1228 mA h g−1 at 0.2C; after 1000 cycles, the decay was 0.024% per cycle at 2C.86 A scheme of the in situ growth of SnO2 on the carbon material derived from bacterial cellulose was proposed. The bacterial fiber was a low-cost, nontoxic, and biocompatible carbon source. SnO2 particles were added to the bacteria for cultivation and then carbonized. Therefore, SnO2 was embedded in the CNFs structure in situ. In this work, Li2S was used as the cathode material and the anode was free of lithium. A discharge capacity of 468 mA h g−1 could be obtained after 100 cycles of 0.1C.87 Sun et al. designed a synthesis process for using C/SnO2/1T-MoS2 as an electrode in ultralong-life LSBs. In their case, after 4000 cycles at 5C, a specific capacity of 448 mA h g−1 could be retained.88 The initial capacity of 1473 mA h g−1 could be attained by using S/SnO2/C as the active material for LSBs. Further, SnO2 could also be inserted to reduce the oxide interlayer, limiting the shuttle effect of LSBs.89 Typically, SnO2 nanoparticles functioning as a separator exhibited excellent wettability with the electrolyte, which enhanced the migration of Li+, while a strong interaction with LPSs led to the high utilization rate of sulfur. The initial discharge capacities of LSBs containing PP and SnO2 as the functional separators were 984 and 1108 mA h g−1, respectively. Their results showed that a functionalized separator exhibited better performance in LSBs than a pristine PP separator.90


2.1.7 Fe-based oxides. 
The redox potential for Fe2O3 was 0.65 V vs. Li/Li+.91 The potential window of iron oxide was far lower than the potential window of LSBs; therefore, iron oxide does not participate in the reaction during the cycling of LSBs. The binding energy of iron oxide toward LPSs was determined from the XPS data, and the corresponding potential was 161.9/163.7 eV.92
A 3D porous structure assembled with uniform α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles was designed by Yang et al. via a one-pot strategy with an initial discharge capacity of 1571 mA h g−1 at 0.3C. A capacity fading rate of 0.049% per cycle after 100 cycles was achieved at 5C. Similar to other oxides, iron oxide facilitates the conversion of soluble LPSs into insoluble LPSs. Likewise, another Fe-based oxide, namely, Fe3O4, has also been used to decorate graphene onto LSBs. Such LSBs equipped with porous graphene–Fe3O4 exhibited a capacity of 732 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1C. The battery also showed a high rate capacity of 1423 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. The excellent electrochemical performance was due to the fact that the porous graphene layer provided a channel for the conduction of lithium ions. On the other hand, Fe3O4 induced a strong chemical action with LPSs to alleviate the shuttle effect.93
Because of its highly conductive nature (5 × 104 S m−1) and polar surface, Fe3O4 has been used as an additive in LSBs. Due to the worthwhile conductivity and fixing effect of Fe3O4 in LSBs, it could form a host material of sulfur after compounding with other carbon materials, yielding good mechanical properties.
As shown in Fig. 6b, yolk–shell carbon/Fe3O4 (YSC/Fe3O4) nanoboxes were designed to be the host of sulfur for LSBs. The unique yolk–shell YSC/Fe3O4 exhibited many advantages. First, due to the fixing effect of Fe3O4, LPSs were fixed in the middle of the nanocassette. Secondly, the large space inside the nanobox not only allowed high sulfur loading, but also moderated the volume change in sulfur during both lithiation and delithiation. Thirdly, the carbon shell acted as a chemical reaction vessel to mechanically limit the loss of LPSs. Finally, the carbon material and Fe3O4 had good electronic conductivity, promoting electrochemical reaction and improving the rate performance of the battery. Typically, S/YSC/Fe3O4 had sulfur content as high as 80 wt% and showed a high reversible specific capacity of 773 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 2C.94 Sun et al. reported a jujube-like Fe3O4/C derived by Fe–MOF as the sulfur host for LSBs. In addition to the advantages commonly found in polar materials, hollow Fe3O4/C compounds derived from MOF materials increased the electrical conductivity of the material and the large void space assists in volume expansion, while the porous structure provided a large amount of active sites for absorbing LPSs. Therefore, the as-prepared Fe3O4/C/S cathode delivered an initial specific capacity of 1324 mA h g−1 at 0.05C and retained a capacity of 642 mA h g−1 at 1C after 300 cycles.95


2.1.8 Co-based oxides. 
The redox potential of Co3O4 was about 1.11 V vs. Li/Li+, which was lower than the potential window for sulfur species (2.1–2.4 V), revealing that it cannot oxidize LPSs.92 Therefore, Co did not change the valence state when charging and discharging in LSBs. Moreover, the binding energy between Co3O4 and LPSs was considerable, leading to the popularity of LSB applications. The Co–S bond corresponded to the peak at 169.4 eV in the XPS data; the Co 2p3/2 peaks shifted to lower binding energies of 780.9 and 779.8 eV, which indicated the electron transfer from polysulfides to Co atoms corresponding to the chemical interaction between Co3O4 and polysulfides.96,97
For instance, a polar surface of Co3O4 nanoneedle array was obtained on carbon cloth. Using this material, an initial capacity of 1231 mA h g−1 at 0.5C for LSBs could be achieved. Capacity decay of 0.049% per cycle after 500 cycles at 2C could be achieved. Due to the polar surface of the Co3O4 nanoneedle array, soluble LPSs could be efficiently adsorbed and converted into insoluble Li2S2 and Li2S during the discharge process, thereby coating the surface of the Co3O4 nanoneedle array. Co3O4 nanoparticles had a catalytic effect on the conversion of short-chain LPSs into long-chain LPSs.98 A low-cost and template-free method to produce multifunctional Co3O4 nanotubes (Co3O4-T) for energy storage was proposed by Zhen. The as-prepared tubes yielded micropores-assisted Li-ion diffusion, thereby enhancing the structural stability. S–Co3O4-T showed an initial capacity of 1081 mA h g−1 and low overpotential of 154 mV at 0.2C.99 Further, Co3O4 nanoparticles could be decorated as carbon rods in LSBs, yielding optimal performance. In this work, Co3O4 nanoparticles were introduced by using a method in which SBA-15 silica was used as the template for injection into a porous carbon material. Linear sweep voltammetry was used to verify the sulfur oxidation reaction, which demonstrated the catalytic performance of the compound from the side.100 Typically, MOF-derived Co3O4 not only has a microporous structure, but also possesses inherent nitrogen. For the first time, Wang et al. reported an N–Co3O4/N–C coated with rGO, contributing toward the enhanced capacity of LSBs, as shown in Fig. 6c. The as-prepared N–Co3O4/N–C/rGO was synthesized via a pyrolysis process, which introduced nitrogen into both oxide and carbon. In this compound, porous Co3O4 and rGO combined to effectively resist volume expansion. In addition, nitrogen-doped oxides and carbon materials provided a large number of active sites to yield strong chemical interactions with LPSs. Therefore, this N–Co3O4/N–C/rGO–S cathode delivered a high reversible capacity of 1223 mA h g−1 at 0.2C. With regard to stability, it showed a capacity of 611 mA h g−1 at 2C after 1000 cycles.101


2.1.9 Mg-based oxides. 
MgO has been considered to be a fixer for polysulfides through chemical bonding (S–Mg–O), facilitating the enhanced utilization of sulfur. The peak of free metallic Mg (49.90 eV) in the XPS data shifted to 51.01 eV, corresponding to Mg engaging with sulfur.102
Shi et al. reported compact rGO and atomic layers to hold sulfur and fix LPSs. In this work, rGO–sulfur (G–S) was combined into an aerogel by the hydrothermal method. The ALD coating assisted in the capture and reuse of soluble LPSs.103 Originally, MgO-decorated CF/CNTs were designed as a self-supported cathode, as discussed by Dou et al. for LSBs and shown in Fig. 6d. In Chen's work, commercial melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin acted as the 3D template and carbon source. CF/CNTs/MgO–S with different sulfur loading values (ranging from 3.8 to 14.4 mg cm−2) and flexible CF/CNTs/MgO hybrid were very promising for fabricating a flexible battery. With regard to the electrochemical performance, an electrode with sulfur loading of 14.4 mg cm−2 yielded an initial areal capacity of 10.4 mA h cm−2.104 As a host of sulfur, the composite can also be produced by MOF. 1,4-Benzenedicarboxylate acid acted like a rod-like unit that was crucial to construct the network. By using magnesium–1,4-benzenedicarboxylate MOF prepared via a simple solvothermal method, the Mg/MgO-inserted mesoporous carbon was firstly reported by Mahanty et al. This MOF-derived carbon combined with S delivered a reversible specific capacity of 1184 mA h g−1 at 0.02C.105


2.1.10 Zn-based oxides. 
ZnO has often been used as an anode material for LIBs due to its low cost and high theoretical specific capacity. As a semiconductor, standard ZnO has a bandgap of 3.37 eV and an exciton binding energy of 60 meV. The conductivity of ZnO can be improved by doping third group elements. ZnO can bond with Li2S8, yielding adsorption energy of 5.67 eV. From the proton balance equation, the adsorption energy was calculated to be 2.43 eV.106
As a raw material for easy atom deposition, ZnO was often coated on the surface of sulfur-loaded carbon materials by atomic deposition strategies to assist in the fixation of LPSs. For instance, ALD-ZnO-modified G–S showed a discharge capacity of 998 mA h g−1 at 0.2C with 55 wt% sulfur. A high capacity of 846 mA h g−1 was achieved after 100 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of over 92%.103 Al-doped ZnO was a promising material for electrochemical applications due to its low cost, environmental friendliness, and high electrical conductivity. Tao was the first to report Al-doped ZnO (AZO)-decorated carbon nanoflakes for use with LSBs. In this work, AZO/C was synthesized by a simple biological template method, and kapok was used as the template and carbon source. The cathode material hosted by AZO/C exhibited a higher capacity of 927 mA h g−1 at 0.1C after 100 cycles and better cycling stability than those obtained by ZnO or Al2O3 alone.107 Mechanical ball milling is widely used to prepare composite materials. Its advantages are as follows: easy to combine materials of the same nature to obtain composite materials with high tap density; easy to commercialize; and easy to repeat. Zhang reported a ZnO/sulfur/CNTs composite built by ball milling for LSBs. The as-prepared cathode indicated an initial capacity of 1663 mA h g−1 at 160 mA g−1.106


2.1.11 La-based oxides. 
In addition to the strong adsorption of LPSs, La2O3 has a strong catalytic effect on the conversion of sulfur, leading to high discharge voltage and fast electrochemical reaction.108 Therefore, La2O3 is a good additive or a host of sulfur for LSBs.
Cai et al. fabricated ultrafine La2O3-decorated nitrogen-enriched mesoporous carbons as an electrode additive for LSBs. The electrode delivered an initial capacity of 1043 mA h g−1 at 1C, which retained 799 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. As a precursor, the doped nitrogen element provided basic sites that enhanced the association of La2O3 nanoparticles with porous carbon and ultimately promoted the distribution of La2O3 nanoparticles.108 In addition, a hollow La2O3-nanospheres-coated separator yielded multiple functions for LSBs. In this particular experiment, hollow spherical La2O3 was prepared by spray drying and covered on a common diaphragm to fabricate a battery, which could efficiently capture LPSs and accelerate the redox reaction. Consequently, the as-prepared batteries delivered an initial capacity of 996 mA h g−1 at 1C and retained a discharge capacity of 720 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles.109


2.1.12 Ce-based oxides. 
The binding energies between CeO2 and S8, Li2S, Li2S4, Li2S6, and Li2S8 are −2.42, −1.96, −2.24, −2.90, −5.48, and −5.63 eV, respectively. The potential of CeO2 is 2.72 V vs. Li/Li+, which is higher than the potential of sulfur species (2.10 V vs. Li/Li+), indicating that CeO2 can oxidize polysulfides into thiosulfate and polythionate.92
CeO2 was found to have a worthwhile effect of fixing LPSs; therefore, it was also used to modify conductive materials for LSBs. Jin et al. developed CeO2-embedded micro–mesoporous carbon nanospheres as a sulfur host for use with LSBs. They injected CeO2 nanoparticles into micro–mesoporous nitrogen-rich carbon (MMNC) nanospheres with two graded pore sizes for efficiently limiting sulfur loss. Typical CeO2-decorated nitrogen-rich carbon nanospheres exhibited sulfur loading of 1.4 mg cm−2. This CeO2/MMNC–S cathode delivered a reversible capacity of 1066 mA h g−1 at 0.2C after 200 cycles and a rate capacity of 737 mA h g−1 at 2C.110 At the same time, CeO2 offered a new choice for the decoration of carbon materials. CeO2 nanoparticles were composited with carbon aerogel and sulfur through a sol–gel method. This CeO2-decorated cathode material delivered an initial discharge capacity of 1381 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, retaining 1127 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles.111


2.1.13 In-based oxides. 
The Li1s spectra (XPS data) showed a red-shift of 0.5 eV in the binding energy of Li1s as compared to that of LixS on a carbon surface, which indicated a strong bonding interaction between LixS and indium tin oxide.112
In addition, Cui et al. used tin-doped InO-decorated CNFs as the host of sulfur. The conductivity of tin-doped InO was as high as 104 S cm−1. They further constructed CNFs with tin-doped InO nanoparticles decorating the surface of a 3D electrode. Using 12.5 μl of 5 M Li2S8 as the electrolyte, the capacity of the cathode could reach 1470 mA h g−1 and the weight of the composite on the electrode was only 4.3 mg cm−1.113

2.2. Multicomponent oxides

2.2.1 Li4Ti5O12. 
The low electron conductivity of sulfur and the limited lithium ion diffusion coefficient yielded low sulfur usage and poor cycling performance of the battery.114 As mentioned above, common oxides (such as SiO2, TiO2, Fe2O3, MnO2, MgO, CeO2, La2O3, etc.) have been used as additives or host of sulfur in LSBs, improving the cycling performance by relieving the shuttle effect. However, these materials do not completely resolve the problem of the diffusion of lithium ions. The Li+ diffusion coefficient can be calculated by the Randles–Sevcik equation using the data from the CVs:Ip = 0.4463nFAC(nFvD/RT)1/2 = 2.690 × 105n3/2AD1/2Cv1/2where Ip denotes the peak current; n, number of electrons transferred in the redox process; A, electrode area; F, Faraday constant; D, Li+ diffusion coefficients; and C, concentration of lithium ions.115,116 Researchers found that Li4Ti5O12 as a polar material could not only adsorb LPSs to relieve the shuttle effect, but also promoted the diffusion of lithium ions during cycling, which ensured the long life of LSBs and high rate performance.
Based on the above advantages of Li4Ti5O12, Hu et al. constructed a core–shell sphere of S/nano-Li4Ti5O12 pieces/C, yielding Li+ conductivity of 2.55 × 10−8 S cm−1. The zero-strain material (Li4Ti5O12) was stably present in the cathode and provided surface-fixed LPSs. The carbon shell acted as an electron conductor and also acted as a cladding layer. Core–shell nano-Li4Ti5O12 pieces/C significantly increased the electron conductivity and lithium ion diffusion efficiency in LSBs. Therefore, even after 1000 cycles at 2C, capacity retention of 600 mA h g−1 could be achieved, which was higher than that of pure S/C.117 With Li4Ti5O12 and graphene composites coating on the separator, the high capacity of 1048 mA h g−1 at 1C could be achieved, which delivered a long cycling life. The above excellent performances could be attributed to the chemical adsorption of Li4Ti5O12 on LPSs and the formation of a dense mixed layer on the surface of the separator.118


2.2.2 Mg0.6Ni0.4O. 
For the first time, Song et al. introduced Mg0.6Ni0.4O produced by the sol–gel method into LSBs as an additive to improve the electrochemical performance of the cathode. It not only adsorbed LPSs, but also exhibited catalytic effect toward the redox reaction, which was derived from the dissociation ability of the material to the S–S single bond.119 However, the S content in the cathode was too low, while the Mg0.6Ni0.4O content was too high.
Nanosized Mg0.6Ni0.4O prepared by a self-propagating high-temperature synthesis method was reported by Chen, which was a simple and effective synthesis technique. As a result, the cathode exhibited S content of over 60 wt% and it delivered a reversible capacity of 850 mA h g−1 in the initial cycle.120 When applying the as-prepared Mg0.6Ni0.4O to LSBs, the sulfur/polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/Mg0.6Ni0.4O composite yielded excellent chemical properties, delivering a discharge capacity of 1223 mA h g−1.121 For improving the performance, Shen et al. coated a Ketjen Black/Mg0.6Ni0.4O composite as the separator for LSBs. The cell equipped with this modified separator maintained a discharge capacity of 530 mA h g−1 after 350 cycles at 0.5C.122


2.2.3 NiCo2O4. 
As typical TMOs, spinel nickel cobaltite had a high density of 5.6 g cm−3, which improved the tap density of LSBs when it was used as the host of sulfur. In addition, NiCo2O4 was a mixed valence oxide and had good electrical conductivity, among which Co3+/Co2+ and Ni3+/Ni2+ could coexist. This polar NiCo2O4 facilitated the chemisorption and catalytic conversion of LPSs.123 In addition, the (311) plane was the most intensive peak of spinel NiCo2O4.124 It might play an important role in retarding the shuttle effect.
With a specific surface area of 241 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 0.59 cm3 g−1, NiCo2O4 nanofibers could be introduced into sulfur-based composites as a carbon-free active material. In this work, 1D NiCo2O4 nanofibers were used as the carbon-free host of sulfur with high S content. Due to the worthwhile conductive network, ion diffusion paths, and chemisorption provided by the fibers, the cathodes showed excellent electrochemical performance. At 0.1C, the S/NiCo2O4 composite showed a capacity of 1125 mA h g−1 and volumetric capacity of 1867 mA h g−1, which was nearly twice those of traditional S/C composites.125 The internal electric field of the heterostructure facilitated the conduction of electrons and enhanced the dynamics of surface chemical reactions. Inspired by these advantages, double-shell NiO–NiCo2O4/C was derived by Prussian blue analogue (PBA) through a calcination method and subsequent hydrothermal carbon coating process. Hierarchically structured nanocages could efficiently block the loss of LPSs, accelerate electron conduction, and catalyze the conversion of LPSs. The as-prepared NiO–NiCo2O4/C electrode exhibited capacities of 1063, 920, 821, and 697 mA h g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2C, respectively.126 To modify the carbon material, an interwoven NiCo2O4 nanosheet/CNTs composite was fabricated by Lu et al. The NiCo2O4/CNTs/S composites had about 61 wt% content of sulfur. It delivered excellent cycling stability with capacity attenuation of 0.038% every cycle after 1200 cycles at 0.5C.127


2.2.4 NiFe2O4. 
Similar to NiCo2O4, NiFe2O4 not only exhibited excellent conductivity, but also had fixing effects on LPSs with a catalytic effect on the transformation of LPSs. Therefore, researchers used it as a host or decorative carbon material for sulfur in LSBs. The existence of Ni catalyzed the transformation of sulfides and retardation of the shuttle effect, depending primarily on the formation of S–O bonds.128
NiFe2O4 was fixed on CNTs for LSBs, as reported by Yang. Due to the good conductivity, adsorption, and catalysis of Ni–Fe bimetallic oxide, the cathode exhibited good rate performance and cycling stability. With sulfur content of 80 wt%, the as-prepared S/NiFe2O4–CNTs delivered a capacity of 550 mA h g−1 at 5C and capacity fade rate of 0.029% per cycle at 1C after 1000 cycles.129 To improve the performance of LSBs, CNTs/NiFe2O4/S was designed by Wang et al. In a typical system, the CNTs acted as a conductor and morphological holder and NiFe2O4 provided a strong binding site to fix LPSs. When cycling at 0.1C, it yielded a capacity of 1350 mA h g−1 with capacity decay of less than 0.009% per cycle after 500 cycles.130 Gao et al. directly applied NiFe2O4 nanotubes to LSBs as the host of sulfur, yielding an initial volumetric capacity of 1281 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. Here, NiFe2O4 played the dual role of conducting and fixing LPSs.128

2.3. TMSs
TMSs exhibit worthwhile fixing and catalytic effects toward LPSs. In general, their conductivities were higher than those of TMOs. TMSs commonly reported in LSBs could be classified as per their metal elements: cobalt-, molybdenum-, tin-, nickel-, and titanium-based materials.

2.3.1 Co-based sulfides. 
There were five intermediate phases in the Co–S system; among them, Co4S3±y and Co1−yS could only be stabilized at higher temperatures.139 The remaining three materials, namely, Co9S8, Co3S4, and CoS2, were suitable for use as cathode materials due to their good conductivities (1.36 × 10−2, 3.3 × 103, and 6.7 × 103 S m−1, respectively) and suitable fixing force. The calculated binding energies between S8, Li2S8, Li2S6, Li2S4, Li2S2, and Li2S and Co9S8 (202) were −6.08, −4.03, −2.97, −4.52, and −5.51 eV, respectively.140 The binding energies of Li2S4, Li2S6, and Li2S8 with Co3S4 were within 1.61–2.76 eV.141 When CoS2 was combined with Li2S4, the binding energy would shift by +1.97 eV, as per the DFT calculations.142
In an early work, Zhang's group synthesized a pyrite-type micron-sized clustered CoS2 sample as an effective additive for graphene nanosheets/sulfur composite cathode of LSBs by a simple hydrothermal method. CoS2 clusters (size: about 1 μm) attached to the wrinkled graphene plate to form an electron path from the conductive frame to the surface of heteropolar CoS2, which yielded a discharge capacity of 1003 mA h g−1 (S/CoS2 (15%) + G cathode at 2.0C) on the first cycle with a low capacity decay rate of 0.034% per cycle after 2000 cycles.142 Li and co-workers evenly dispersed CoS2 on rGO via using the bottom-up assembly methods and hydrothermal treatment, which also exhibited good performance (after 110 cycles at 0.5C, the capacity was 807 mA h g−1).143 Further, the method of dispersing cobalt sulfide as an additive in the carbon material was to subject cobalt to sulfuration after calcining ZIF-67. Through this method, CoS2/N-doped porous carbon,144 CoS2/N-doped carbon polyhedrons,145 Co9S8/hollow nanopolyhedra,140 and hollow Co3S4 polyhedra/activated CNFs146 composites were synthesized.
Since the carbon material had a low tap density to lower the energy density of LSBs and cobalt sulfide had good conductivity, directly using cobalt sulfide as the sulfur-carrying host was a possibility. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, Zhang and co-workers used urea and cobalt chloride as the reactants to synthesize Co3S4 nanotubes as the host of sulfur by the hydrothermal method as well as the Kirkendall effect, which delivered high sulfur loading and stable performance (low capacity decay rate of 0.041% per cycle at 5C).141 In order to further increase the electrical and lithium ion conductivities, Chen and co-workers prepared a honeycomb-like sphere composed of polar Co9S8 small tubes (pores diameters: ∼50 nm) by a two-step hydrothermal method. A high aspect ratio induced by the tubular structure could act as a conduit for facilitating electron and ion transports with the aligned thin tubes, yielding a better conductive framework. This yielded a discharge capacity of 894 mA h g−1 at the first cycle with a low decay rate of 0.026% per cycle after 600 cycles.147

In general, the worthwhile conductivity of cobalt sulfide enabled its direct use as a host of sulfur. Moreover, it could improve the energy density of LSBs when compared with when it was used as an additive for the carbon matrix.


2.3.2 Mo-based sulfides. 
The binding energy between S8 and MoS2 was calculated to be 0.05 eV. After lithiation, the binding energies of Li2S8, Li2S6, Li2S4, Li2S2, and Li2S on MoS2 were 0.10, 0.22, 0.32, 0.65, and 0.87 eV, respectively, as per the following relationship: Eb = ELPS + EMo-based sulfide − ELPS+Mo-based sulfide.148
MoS2 is a low-cost catalyst that provides good performance and has been shown to be very effective at catalyzing several industrially important reactions. Several works have proven that MoS2 could effectively catalyze the conversion of long-chain soluble LPSs into insoluble short-chain compounds, thereby providing a guarantee for the charge and discharge stabilities of LSBs. The applications of MoS2 in LSBs can be categorized as follows: (1) directly combined with sulfur, (2) with a carbon-based material as a matrix, and (3) with other polar materials as a matrix.
For the first category, Pyun and co-workers directly dispersed MoS2 in liquid elemental sulfur (S8) by a simple one-pot method, and the composite material was prepared by the thermal ring-opening sequential polymerization of the sulfur phase or reverse sulfurization copolymerization.149 Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 7c and d, Lee et al. used hollow sulfur particles directly wrapped by MoS2 nanosheets as a cathode material, yielding an initial capacity of 1660 mA h g−1 at 0.1C; this decreased to 0.049% per cycle in the next 1000 cycles at 1C.150 In order to improve the commercialization of LSBs, Suo's group proposed fast lithium intercalation and electrochemically active Chevrel-phase Mo6S8 as the matrix material that could achieve high tap density, and it could catalyze the conversion of sulfur species while achieving the above advantages. The battery delivered a high initial capacity of 7.8 mA h cm−2 and maintained a capacity of 83% after 100 cycles at 1 mA cm−2; however, when assembled into an Ah-level pouch battery, it could yield high Ev and Eg values of 581 and 366 W h kg−1, respectively.151
In addition to this, a combination of MoS2 and TMOs was also an effective design. Further, by using the core–shell architecture to improve the stability of LSBs, Ye's group prepared a mesoporous SiO2/MoS2 core–shell structure to achieve a capacity of 369 mA h g−1 after 1500 cycles at 1C.152 Xue and co-workers uniformly loaded SnO2 on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets by a two-step hydrothermal method, achieving a capacity of 900 mA h g−1 after 80 cycles at 0.2C.153 Furthermore, Guo's group used MXene with 1T–2H MoS2–nitrogen-doped carbon composites in order to increase the conductivity of the system while limiting the solubility of LPSs; impressively, after 300 cycles, a capacity of 799 mA h g−1 at 0.5C could be achieved.154
Further, in order to increase the conductivity of the LSB system, several studies combined MoS2 with carbon materials, such as rGO,155–157 elemental-doped GO,158 aerogel,159 CNTs,160 and HC nanobubbles.148 Zheng's group reduced the GO loaded with MoS2 into MoS2−x and rGO with hydrogen at high temperatures. MoS2−x, which had better catalytic effect than MoS2, guaranteed the cycling stability of the battery, delivering 628 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles at 0.5C.157 In Lin's work, polar MoS2 not only acted as a fixer of polysulfides, but also acted as a strong catalyst that could improve the redox kinetics of the polysulfides. As a result, the as-prepared N-doped porous carbon/MoS2/CNT could exhibit a capacity of 671 mA h g−1 at 2C and capacity fading rate of 0.059% per cycle for 500 cycles at 1C.161
Although Mo-based sulfides did not have very good electrical conductivity, the catalytic effects of their LPS conversion has been effectively documented. Improving the conductivity and improving the fixing effect would be an important direction. For this combination with a conductive material with good conductivity, Mo-based materials might see further investigations.


2.3.3 Sn-based sulfides. 
SnS2—a semiconductor—exhibits poor conductivity, but it has been used as a polar matrix with a fixing effect on LPSs. The calculated adsorption energies of Li2S8, Li2S6, and Li2S4 on SnS2 were −0.23, −0.19, and −0.50 eV, respectively.162 According to the obtained results, lithium atoms get adsorbed on the top sites of S in SnS2.163 In order to resolve the problem of poor conductivity, SnS2 was usually combined with a carbon-based material, such as graphene-based materials,164 CNTs,165 HC nanospheres,166 and porous carbon.163 On the other hand, in order to further enhance the fixing effect of SnS2 on LPSs, a combination of TMOs such as SnO2 (ref. 163 and 167) or TiO2 (ref. 168) have also been reported.
In terms of combining with carbon-based materials, a study described the hydrothermal growth of Co-doped SnS2 as a matrix on N-doped CNTs. Their results showed that such Co doping not only improved the fixing between SnS2 and LPSs, but also was an effective catalyst for promoting the conversion of LPSs. Therefore, the utilization of sulfur could be improved, yielding higher specific capacity (1004 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 1.3 mA cm−2).165
Two ways to combine SnS2 with TMOs have been reported: (1) forming a simple compound and (2) forming a heterojunction between the two compounds. Taking SnO2 as an example, Zhu et al. used metal Sn, sulfur, and porous carbon as the raw materials for the baked-in-salt method; in addition to the in situ formation of SnO2 or SnS2, excess sulfur would be impregnated into the pores of porous carbon, and SnO2 and SnS2 could also provide fixing effects with LPSs, yielding a capacity of 780 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles of 0.5C.163 On the other hand, Wang's group synthesized SnS2/SnO2 heterostructure nanosheets on CNFs and delivered over 600 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2C.167


2.3.4 Ni-based sulfides. 
Reports regarding NiS2 used in LSBs have also been impressive. The chemical bond between NiS2 and Li2S4 was reflected by the shifting of the peaks by about 0.5 eV to the lower side in the XPS.46,169 Further, the binding energy between them was 3.60 eV. In order to explore the application of NiS2 in LSBs, Liu and co-workers synthesized amorphous NiS2 by the solution method. This not only effectively adsorbed soluble LPSs, but also contained insoluble sulfur-active substances generated during the cycle, which could retain an initial capacity of 77% after 1200 cycles at 0.5 A g−1.170
Studies have been conducted to combine NiS2 with a nonpolar conductive carbon material, such as carbon shells,171 porous carbon,172 and rGO.173,174 Zhang's group formed carbon-coated NiS2 nanoparticles by the simultaneous decomposition and vulcanization of yolk–shell Ni MOF spheres (Fig. 7e and f), which delivered a high initial capacity of 1010 mA h g−1 at 0.2C.171


2.3.5 Ti-based sulfides. 
TiS2 is a type of conductive material with good conductivity in TMSs. Meanwhile, DFT data revealed that the fixation of TiS2 and LPSs was nearly 10 times stronger than that of traditional carbon materials. Uniquely, TiS2 has a potential close to that of sulfur; therefore, it does not require complicated electronic control. However, there are only a few reports on LSBs. One of the important reasons for this is that TiO2 is extremely stable, resulting in the formation of TiO2 instead of TiS2 in most cases.
In an early work, Garsuch's group mixed TiS2 with S/C for use as the cathode material and found that although the initial specific capacity of the battery was reduced, the electrical cycling stability was improved (charge and discharge capacities would be higher than those in a traditional S/C electrode after about 10 cycles).175 Using commercial TiS2 as a substrate, Manthiram's group showed that TiS2 not only helped to increase the capacity, but also improved the dispersibility of sulfur. More importantly, he proposed that designing a porous architecture of TiS2 would help to expand its advantages in the LSBs.176 Inspired by the pores between the foam frames, Archer's group synthesized an interconnected sulfur/TiS2 hybrid foam using the thermal reaction of Ti metal foam and S8. The binding energy was 2.60 eV between Li2S and TiS2.177 To reduce the pore size with a larger specific surface area, Yang's group used water steam etching of TiS2 at a lower temperature to obtain porosity of H- and O-incorporated porous TiS2, which delivered 374 mA h g−1 over 1000 cycles at 10C.178
In addition to the above materials, 2D sheet-like TiS2 has also been recently reported.179 TiS2 is a type of promising TMS, but it should be noted that the synthesis of TiS2 was hard-won, and this was one of the reasons that limited its extensive exploration.


2.3.6 Fe-based sulfides. 
The primary Fe-based sulfides used in LSBs were FeS2 and FeS. FeS2 was the main component of pyrite, and pyrite was the most abundant of the current sulfur minerals. FeS has good conductivity (10−1–10 S m−1). After absorbing into LPSs, slight redshifts in the peaks at 363 and 375 cm−1 are evident in the Raman spectroscopy. Zhang's group reported that FeS2 had a fixing effect on Li2Sn, which was represented by the interaction between the radical anion of the polysulfide generated in the sulfur redox process and the sulfur site in FeS2 to form an active Li2FeS2+n complex. They experimented with commercial sulfur and pyrite FeS2, obtaining a capacity of 700 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles with 10 wt% sulfur.180 In order to enhance the capacity of FeS2 in LSB systems, Marschilok et al. extended the voltage range to 1.0–2.6V. Studies have shown that FeS2 would dissolve during the of charge and discharge cycles, depositing FeS (which might become an electron conductor) at the lithium anode. This phenomenon made the SEI layer considerably less efficient in slowing down the redox reaction of the sulfur species on the lithium surface, enhancing the shuttle effect.181 As shown in Fig. 8a, Lai and co-workers used a simple continuous ball milling method to generate FeS2/FeS/S nanocomposites in situ using a redox reaction between Fe3+ and Sx2− (S and FeSx share a high contact area), which delivered 941 mA h g−1 between 1.2 and 3.0 V after 200 cycles at 1600 mA g−1.182 Furthermore, in order to fully utilize the electrochemical capacity of Fe-based sulfides in the LSB system, an effective cathode passivation method and a reasonable voltage range are required to prevent the deposition of FeS2/FeS at the cathode. Simultaneously combining the lithium products of S/FeSx composited with higher theoretical cathode materials would also help achieve higher-capacity LSBs.

2.3.7 Miscellaneous works. 
Although few reports exist on these, W-, V-, and Re-based sulfides have also played important roles in LSBs.
ReS2 could provide fixing to LPSs through the active sites of its edge and surface. Koratkar's group successfully controlled the density, size, and crystal quality of ReS2 nanosheets by controlling the growth conditions of CVD. Further, by growing ReS2 nanosheets on CNFs, a capacity of 750 mA h g−1 could be achieved over 300 cycles at 0.5C.183
WS2 was also a layered TMS. As shown in Fig. 8b and c, Xiong's group fabricated a compact WS2 nanosheet wound and fixed in a CNF composite, where sulfur was effectively dispersed in the matrix materials. Meanwhile, WS2 nanosheets exhibited the polar adsorption of LPSs and excellent electron transport network of 3D interconnected architecture of CNFs, retaining a specific capacity of approximately 90% after 1500 cycles at 2C.184 In addition, they successfully used an in situ preparation method to immobilize WS2 on mesoporous carbon nanosheets, yielding capacities of 3, 3.7, and 4.4 mA h cm−2 at 1, 0.5, and 0.2C, respectively.185
VS2 is also a TMS that can easily form a sheet-like structure. Works on VS2 have concentrated upon two strategies: (1) directly compounding with sulfur or (2) combining with carbon and then combining with sulfur. Yan's group prepared VS2 nanoflowers composed of aligned ultrathin nanosheets by the hydrothermal method. Fig. 8d shows the SEM image of a flower-like material with numerous spaces between the nanosheets. Further, Fig. 8e shows the TEM images revealing that sulfur was effectively injected in the middle of the nanoflowers, yielding a capacity of 240 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2C. The conductivity of VS2 might be inferior to that of graphene-based materials and nanoflowers are more open than a closed structure, which were not conducive to fixing sulfur.186 Xiao et al. used the hydrothermal method for forming a cathode material using an rGO–VS2 sandwich structure, which not only combined the sulfophilicity of the matrix with the conductivity of a nonpolar matrix, but also reduced the interface resistance because of VS2 present on the rGO surface and increase the tap density of the cathode materials.187 Similarly, Sun and co-workers synthesized graphene nanosheets–VS2 composites via an in situ assembly method, yielding 532 mA h g−1 at 5C after 300 cycles.188
For other chalcogenides, the CoSe2 phase provided a large number of active sites for the adsorption of LPSs while enhancing the electrical conductivity. The uniform distribution of CoSe2 nanodots induced uniform nucleation and Li2S growth. Finally, three phases were formed on the surface of the current collector. Therefore, the electrolyte/CoSe2/Li2S system was reported to yield chemisorption, high conductivity, and electrocatalysis of LPSs. Therefore, the as-prepared batteries cycled at 6C yielded initial capacities of 916 and 459 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles.189 After that, in 2018, rGO/CoSe2 was used to modify the separators of LSBs, yielding an initial discharge capacity of 1180 mA h g−1 at 0.2C. The above excellent performance was due to the fact that rGO provided a conductive network, while CoSe2 provided chemical adsorption to LPSs.190
Chalcogenides have received extensive attention in LSBs due to their fixing and catalytic effects with LPSs. When compared with TMOs, TMSs have higher conductivity due to their covalent properties. In particular, most layered TMSs (such as MoS2, WS2, etc.) have 2D architecture similar to that of graphene-based materials, where sulfur could be injected into their interlayers. Furthermore, several works have proven that the reduction of TMSs with hydrogen could not only improve their conductivity, but also enhance the fixing and catalytic effects with LPSs. Finally, whether some amorphous TMSs would have special functions as a matrix material for LSBs or not still requires further investigation.

2.4. TMCs
TMCs, most of which are conductive materials, such as TiC, Mo2C, Fe3C, NbC, SiC, and WC were also designed to be pivotal polar materials when used as cathode materials for LSBs.

2.4.1 Ti-based carbides. 
Ti-based carbides have been widely used in 2D materials for LSBs to achieve strong binding to LPSs and fast conversion of LPSs. TiC as a polar material exhibited a stronger ability to adsorb LPSs and increased conductivity than that of TiO2. There are many different ways to synthesize TiO2, such as a direct reaction between titanium powders and carbon; mechanical ball milling; carbothermal reduction of TiO2 powders with carbon at high temperatures; chemical vapor deposition (CVD); and co-reduction synthesis method using TiCl4, C2Cl4, and metallic sodium. The final morphology is shown in Fig. 9a.191

For instance, graphene was used as the template to react with TiCl4 to form a heterostructure of graphene/TiC, which provided a worthwhile transmission path for Li ions and electrons. This in-plane heterostructure of graphene and TiC ensured strong binding to LPSs and, at the same time, prevented the loss of LPSs and formed a wide range of conductive networks that could catalyze their conversion during cycling.192 By compositing with TiO2, the as-prepared TiC/TiO2 compound could prove to be an excellent host of sulfur. With the help of TiC, the conductivity and catalytic capacity of the host could be improved.38
A new 2D material named MXene has been used in LSBs. Such 2D materials were usually modified into Mn+1XnTx, where M denotes a transition metal; X, carbon or nitrogen; and T, a surface functional group. Titanium-based MXenes are very promising fixing materials that can be used in LSBs. It is well known that the fixing material has a negatively charged surface that can easily capture LPSs. Therefore, TiC functionalized with F and O was introduced into LSBs as a conductive fixing material. Depending on the functional groups, 2D materials with a fixing behavior, namely, TiC-based MXenes (e.g., Ti2CF2 and Ti2CO2), have attracted the attention of researchers. The binding energies (Eb) between LPSs and substrates could be calculated according to the following formula: Eb = −[Etotal − ELPS − EMxene]. The binding energies of LPSs and Ti2CF2 were between 1.02 and 1.15 eV. The energies of Li2S and Li2S4 on monolayer Ti3C2F2 were −0.29 and −0.38 eV, respectively. Further, Li2S4 was adsorbed on Ti2CO2 (Eb = 1.92 eV).193,194 Wang et al. reported a 3D TMC of Ti3C2Tx/mesoporous carbon hybrid derived from Ti3C2Tx/mesoporous MOF-5 acting as the host of LSBs. The as-prepared cathodes could achieve a high capacity of 1225 mA h g−1 at 0.5C.195 The 2D MXene materials were reported to be excellent sulfur hosts because of their conductivity and functional surface. With sulfur content of 70 wt%, S/Ti2C composites delivered considerable electrochemical performance. A specific capacity of 1200 mA h g−1 could be achieved at 0.2C. Further, 80% capacity could be retained after 400 cycles at 0.5C.196 Nazar et al. introduced CNTs into interwoven MXene nanosheets to improve the conductivity and stability, ultimately enhancing the cycling performance of LSBs after long-term cycling for 1200 cycles at 0.5C.197 Typically, crumpled N–Ti3C2Tx was synthesized by Wang et al. through an electrostatic self-assembly method for the first time. This hierarchical pore structure of nitrogen-doped MXene nanosheets had a large surface area of 385 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 0.342 cm3 g−1. The sulfur loading of 5.1 mg cm−2 and reversible capacity of 1144 mA h g−1 at 0.2C could be achieved. The cycling stability (610 mA h g−1 at 2C after 1000 cycles) of the cathode was also achieved.198 Wang coated Ti3C2Tx onto the separators to form functionalized separators for improving the conductivity and trapping sites for LPSs. This 2D material formed a coating with mass of only 0.1 mg cm−2 on the surface of the diaphragm. Due to the conductivity and sulfur fixation of the coating, the formation of multifunctional separators could facilitate their use in LSB systems.199


2.4.2 B4C. 
Manthiram et al. firstly applied B4C in LSBs successfully, taking advantage of its fixing and catalytic effects. In their work, a B4C nanowire array (length: 4–10 μm) was grown on CNFs, which improved the specific surface area. Since the (100) and (111) crystals of B4C exhibited a strong adsorption force with LPSs, the prepared LSBs had good stability as well as 70 wt% sulfur. A capacity of 815 mA h g−1 could be achieved after 500 cycles at 1C, which was better than that under similar conditions without B4C-added electrodes.200 B4C nanowires were fabricated as the skeleton by Li et al., which were used to modify cotton-textile-derived carbon and rGO, yielding extremely high sulfur content and improved electrochemical performance.201


2.4.3 Mo2C. 
The interaction between Mo2C and Li2S6 was revealed by XPS. The S 2p3/2 at 163.0 and 161.3 eV corresponded to a shift of +0.9 eV and +1 eV for bridging sulfur and terminal sulfur, respectively. The Mo–S bond corresponded to the energy of 161.3 eV.41
In order to reduce the energy barrier of the LSBs in the redox reaction, Mo2C nanosheets were equipped into CNTs, thereby becoming a part of the sulfur hosts. Huang et al. constructed S–Mo2C/CNTs as the active material of a cathode in LSB. As a result, the composite exhibited a specific capacity of 1206 mA h g−1 at 0.5C and a long cycle life (900 cycles) at 2C.202 Due to the catalytic properties and good electrical conductivity of Mo2C, Yang et al., for the first time, fabricated β-Mo2C/CNFs by electrospinning and used this material to encapsulate sulfur. The as-prepared β-Mo2C/CNFs is shown in Fig. 9b. The materials synthesized by them possessed worthwhile lithium-ion diffusivity and marginal interfacial resistance.203 Typically, in order to construct Mo2C-based MXenes, Wang et al. etched the Sn layer of Mo2SnC, as shown in Fig. 9c. Subsequently, they embedded CNTs into the Mo2C-based MXenes for use as cathode materials in LSBs. In their work, the hydroxyl-functionalized surfaces of Mo2C were proven to have a strong fixation effect on LPSs, which considerably alleviated the shuttle effect of LSBs. The composite produced by this method exhibited good stability, adapted to the strain of the electrode, and the composite material had much better electrochemical performance than the individual components as sulfur carriers.204 Liang et al. designed Mo2C into a 3D hierarchical structure, which had both high conductivity (30 S cm−1) and good fixing effect on LPSs. The structure of Mo2C is shown in Fig. 9d. The surface area of the sulfur electrode added to the Mo2C nanosheet was 3.24 mA h cm−1. They found that when the nanosheet-like Mo2C was bonded to the carbon cloth, it showed better flexibility; this discovery was meaningful for making soft-pack LSBs.205


2.4.4 Other carbides. 
Due to the richness and low cost of iron, Fe-based carbides have gradually entered into the researcher's field of vision as a polar material capable of fixing LPSs. An iron atom can establish a strong connection with LPSs through the Fe–S bond, which facilitated in resolving the shuttle effect in LSBs.206 Zhang et al. produced an Fe3C-embedded porous carbon sheet via a one-step pyrolysis method. Due to the excellent electrical conductivity and strong sulfur fixation effect, the battery delivered capacities of 1127 and 647 mA h g−1 at 0.3 and 5C, respectively, with 0.036% capacity decay per cycle.207
NbC had excellent electrical conductivity of 2.9 × 106 S m−1 and good chemical stability. The above advantages facilitated its application to LSBs. The adsorbed Li2S4 on the NbC surface yielded shifts of +0.7 and +0.9 V for terminal sulfur and bridging sulfur, respectively. However, a conventional synthesis method necessitated higher temperatures, and the obtained NbC had low yields and poor crystallinity.208 Zhu et al. synthesized nanocrystalline NbC with good crystallinity at 600 °C in a high-pressure reactor by using the magnesium thermal reduction method and applied it to the membrane modification of LSBs. They obtained considerable electrochemical performance. Utilizing the conductivity of NbC and the good adsorption effect on LPSs, the utilization of sulfur and rate performance were improved. The cells achieved cyclability of 1500 cycles and a good areal capacity of 3.6 mA h cm−2 with sulfur content of 4 mg cm−2.209
Yushin et al. etched Si at different temperatures to adjust the shape and size of the SiC pores. When applying to LSBs, the electrochemical performance of SiC, after etching at 900 °C, proved to be better than those of SiC etched at 700 and 800 °C.210 As mentioned above, due to several dangling bonds present at the edges, WS2 exhibited a very high adsorption capacity.211 However, WS2 is a type of semiconductor. It is worth noting that WC has very good conductivity and exhibited a similar edge effect as that of WS2. Kim et al. used this feature to apply WC to LSBs and they found that WC exhibited catalytic conversion in LSBs. They applied it on carbon-covered separators and the as-prepared battery exhibited a high discharge capacity of 780 mA h g−1 at 5C.212

2.5. TMNs
It is well known that TMNs have been widely used in the field of supercapacitors and LIBs due to their excellent electrochemical properties. In the recent years, researchers have found TMNs with excellent stability, as well as LPSs with excellent adsorption and catalytic properties; they have been selectively used in a large number of LSBs.
Ng's group studied a series of nitrides applied to the electrochemical performance of LSBs, and they formed a series of comparisons. They found that WN performed better among WN, VN, and Mo2N derived from ammonium salts. The WN cathode exhibited higher capacity relative to those of VN and Mo2N.213 VN not only had the ability to adsorb LPSs, but also had considerable conductivity (1.71 × 106 S m−1) at room temperature and excellent catalytic ability. Li et al. combined VN and rGO and used this combination to form LSBs, which retained a capacity of 1252 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2C.214
With regard to Co-based nitrides, Co4N mesoporous spheres exhibited better capability to absorb LPSs than a Co3O4 sphere with similar sizes and specific surface areas. Dong et al. prepared a Co4N mesoporous sphere via a facility of nanosheets that could accommodate 72 wt% sulfur. The prepared battery exhibited a capacity of 1659 mA h g−1 at the rate of 0.1C. The final capacity stabilized at 585 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 5C. When Li2S6 was almost completely absorbed, the former peaks of 218 and 478 cm−1 disappeared, indicating the combination between Co4N and Li2S6.215
Due to the nitrogen–titanium triple bond in TiN, it had strong stability and was not easily corroded; TiN had strong conductivity of 4000–55500 S cm−1. K. Y. S. Ng et al. found that TiN could absorb LPSs and it could also connect with S to form S–Ti–N.216 Based on these excellent properties, researchers applied various forms of TiN compounds for use in LSBs. For instance, Huang et al. applied commercial TiN to form a cathode for LSBs. As a result, at 0.5C, TiN/S cathodes delivered an initial capacity of 1012 mA h g−1. Even at 5C, they still demonstrated a reversible capacity of 550 mA h g−1. In addition, the shift toward the lower side in the XPS data indicated the formation of a Ti–S bond.217 Li et al. modified separators with mesoporous TiN. This work combined high conductivity and fixing effect of TiN to obtain multifunctional separators, which acted as a blocker of LPSs as well as an electron conductor. Finally, a high capacity of 672 mA h g−1 could be achieved.218
2.6. Hydroxides
Due to poor electrical conductivity, hydroxides can be integrated into certain conductive systems to fix LPSs. For instance, Co(OH)2 has been used to combine with CNFs. The efficiency of suppressing the shuttle effect was reflected by the interaction between Co(OH)2 and LPSs. The binding energies of Li2S8, Li2S6, Li2S4, and Li2S2 on Co(OH)2 were −1.99, −2.78, −2.69, and −3.78 eV, respectively. As a result, the S/Co(OH)2 cathode delivered initial discharge capacities of 1100 and 606 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 2C. In addition, the mass content of 80 wt% sulfur could be achieved in this work.219 Chen et al. constructed Co(OH)2–CNFs with Ketjen Black for modifying the separators of LSBs. With the help of functionalized separators, an initial capacity of 1394 mA h g−1 at 0.1C could be achieved.220 Similarly, Ni(OH)2 and Co(OH)2 could be equivalently used for LSBs. Due to the abundant hydrogen–oxygen functional groups present on the surface, Ni(OH)2 had a strong adsorption effect on LPSs and exhibited strong affinity toward the electrolyte. A LSB with a long cycle life could be realized by using sulfur encapsulated in such a material to form the positive electrode.221 Zhang et al. applied the double technique of combining supercritical CO2 fluid technology and biotemplating method to construct Ni(OH)2/porous carbon/sulfur composites derived from biomaterials. The fabricated electrode was capable of achieving a capacity of 1335 mA h g−1 at 0.1C.222 Lai et al. employed a combination of ZnO-modified CNTs and Ni(OH)-modified CNTs (formed via the ball milling method) as a host of sulfur for use in LSBs, which delivered better electrochemical performance than that obtained by bare S/CNTs electrodes.106
2.7. Metallic elements
Pure metal particles are gradually being used as polar materials in the modification of precursors in LSBs. Since elemental Se has similar chemical properties as those of elemental sulfur, it can also be used in enhancing capacity when assembled into LSBs.223,224 Xie et al. used acrylonitrile after vulcanization as the cathode for forming an all-solid LSB. Their work showed that 5 mol% Se could be introduced into sulfur as a communion system, which not only became a homogeneous system, but also enhanced the dynamics and enhanced the capacity. In particular, they used Li10GeP2S12 as the electrolyte in their study, and the ratio of Se0.05S0.95/polypropylene, Li10GeP2S12, and carbon used to assemble the battery was 4:4:2. In XPS, the Se 3p1/2 and Se 3p3/2 peaks at 161.9 eV indicated the presence of Se–S bonds. Finally, the assembled all-solid-state battery exhibited a capacity of 1300 mA h g−1 at 0.1C; further, their work also proved that the incorporation of elemental Se increased the diffusion capacity of lithium ions.225 As shown in Fig. 10a, Co nanoflowers modified with CNTs could act as the host of sulfur. In this work, Jin et al. implanted nitrogen-doped CNTs onto Co nanoflowers and applied them as the host material for sulfur cathode. This precursor achieved high sulfur content (78 wt%) in addition to yielding a long-life battery; a capacity of 623 mA h g−1 could be achieved at 1C after 500 cycles.226

2.8. MOFs and MOF-derived materials
As a combination of metallic and organic materials, MOFs can easily be used as precursors to obtain a composite with polar and nonpolar carbon materials. Their derivatives were used in LSBs to promote fixing LPSs and electrical conductivity. Secondly, as a polar material containing a Lewis acid, MOFs can be grown on carbon materials to provide polar sites. Lastly, MOFs and their derivatives could also be used to modify a membrane to make it a multifunctional separator.

In situ Mg/MgO-decorated mesoporous carbon derived from MOFs can be used as the host of sulfur. They used the solvothermal method and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a structure-directing agent to easily synthesize the precursor, finally forming a porous carbon-based composite containing Mg/MgO. With the help of MgO, sulfur could be immobilized. This work provided a novel idea for the preparation of carbon skeletons decorated with MOF-derived polar materials.105 As shown in Fig. 10b, Zhang et al. developed a hollow sphere with a porphyrin organic framework through the template method to function as the host of sulfur. In this work, the porphyrin organic framework was selected to coat the PS template due to its ease of uniform distribution, ease of synthesis, and versatility.227 Feng et al. first applied MOF-derived jujube-like Fe3O4/C composite as the host of sulfur in LSBs. As shown in Fig. 10c, Fe3O4 synthesized by them exhibited a porous jujube nucleus with large voids and high specific surface area, which could accommodate any volume changes in the material; further, its rich carbon content enhanced the conductivity and the polar oxide provided adsorption sites for LPSs that could considerably alleviate the shuttle effect. Based on the above advantages, an Fe3O4/C/S electrode exhibited a specific discharge capacity of 1324 mA h g−1 at 0.05C.95 As shown in Fig. 10d, the Co9S8 array was first used to modify the separator, which eased the shuttle effect without a considerable change in the weight and thickness of the separator. This in situ grown MOF-material-derived hollow Co9S8 was proposed by Arumugam Manthiram et al., yielding a capacity of 530 mA h g−1 at 1C and average attenuation of 0.039% per revolution after 1000 cycles.228 Research fellows used MOF-derived carbon (with considerable electrical conductivity) as the polar materials in cathodes. For instance, MOFs-derived carbon materials not only exhibited good conductivity, but also had a certain ability to fix LPSs for a certain amount of nitrogen residues.229 Further, 2D carbon nanosheets derived from ZIF-8 yielded hierarchical pores. The as-prepared S/ZIF-8 carbon nanosheets delivered a high capacity of 1226 mA h g−1 at 0.2C with a capacity fade rate of 0.12% per cycle at 0.5C for 300 cycles.230
With regard to polar materials, the organometallic frame has increasingly attracted the focus of researchers in the energy storage field because of advantages such as structural diversity, high surface area, and compositional adjustability.231,232 Since polar materials have an absorbing capacity for LPSs, they can be directly used as a host to resolve the shuttle effect in LSBs. Xie et al. prepared an organometallic framework of [(CH3)2NH2]2[Cd(L)]·5DMF containing aromatic rings, which ensured high sulfur storage of 72 wt% due to its open channels. Additional semi-open channels ensured better discharge capacities, i.e., 1092 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and 571 mA h g−1 at 1C.233 Wang et al. loaded 70 wt% sulfur into pyrene-based 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) as the cathode of long-life LSBs. These COFs possessed a high specific surface area and large pore volume. Due to these advantages, the as-prepared batteries delivered capacities of 963 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1C and 481 mA h g−1 after 550 cycles at 5C.234 It has been proven that the Lewis acid active sites of non-carbonized MOFs are vital toward constructing long-life LSBs.235,236 As far as the design of MOFs is concerned, it must first be ensured that they are stable during the cycling process, subsequently ensuring that the rich channels can store sulfur. For instance, Qian's group implanted Cu active sites into a zirconium–metalloporphyrin framework (MOF-525) as a powerful host of sulfur and fixer of LPSs. This self-assembled material ensured the presence of rich channels as well as Lewis acid sites.237 Similarly, Thoi made a MOF with Cu-rich facial active sites to resolve the shuttle effect. They used benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate as a linker to synthesize dual-core copper units. This work provided new ideas for using MOF as a host for sulfur. They also found that due to the establishment of copper–sulfur bonds, this MOF material possessed many active sites for adsorbing sulfur. Further, they found that controlling the size of MOF nanosheets could improve the battery performance.238 Although MOF materials have many of the above advantages, their conductivity is poor, resulting in the inability to maintain high specific capacity when applied to LSBs. To resolve these problems, two main methods have been recently attempted by several researchers. These MOFs could be compounded with conductive materials.239 For example, Cao and Xu combined MOFs with aerogels and CNTs, respectively, through in situ growth methods to improve the conductivity and improved reversible capacities were achieved, as shown in Fig. 10e and f. Xu et al. developed zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 and University of Oslo-66 in situ on bacterial cellulose to form an aerogel with a graded pore size and large surface area. Finally, they used polydopamine to coat the synthesized nanofibers; therefore, the capacity of the assembled battery using pure nanofibers increased from 631 to 739 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5C.240,241 Lin et al. reported the construction of 3D hollow core–shell structures composed of CNTs, Ni(OH)2, and ZIF-67. The Ni(OH)2 shell acted as a physical barrier and fixer of polysulfides. N-Doped CNTs introduced active sites for polysulfide adsorption, creating a transport path for Li+/e−. As a result, the as-prepared batteries showed rate capacities of 1030 and 753 mA h g−1 at 1 and 3C, respectively.242 Resorcinol–formaldehyde-coated ZIF-67-derived Co and carbon material composites contained polar Co particles and electronegative N heteroatoms. A high reversible capacity of 1373 mA h g−1 could be obtained at 0.1C and capacity decay rate of 0.041% per cycle for 500 cycles at 1C could be achieved.243 Chen et al. used graphene to improve the conductivity of MOF materials, too.244
Because of the improvement in the shuttle effect, MOFs have often been used to modify and improve the separators of LSBs.245 For instance, Zheng et al. obtained batteries having specific capacities of 1220 and 800 mA h g−1 at 0.1 and 2C, respectively, by modifying the separators with conductive 2D Ni3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)2. Typically, they modified the separators via a quick filtration method.246 Ho Seok Park et al. fabricated MOFs of Zr6O4(OH)4(1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)6-functioned separators. In their work, the diaphragm had the dual function of sulfur fixation and catalysis; therefore, the capacity and reversibility of the battery were improved, and the stability was also enhanced.247
2.9. Polymers
A polymer is a type of polar matrix that can fix LPSs in order to inhibit a series of side reactions caused by dissolution in an electrolyte during the charge and discharge processes. Polymers are formed by covalent bonds, yielding a high molecular weight and ability to be effectively designed.
Firstly, a polymer can be fabricated by directly co-heating with sulfur to adsorb LPSs during the charge and discharge processes of LSBs.248,249 Zhang's group prepared poly(pyrrole-co-aniline) copolymer nanofibers by chemical oxidation using cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the template. After co-heating with sulfur at 160 °C, a capacity of 866 mA h g−1 could be achieved after 40 cycles.250 Similarly, Wen and co-workers synthesized tubular polypyrrole (T-PPy) fibers, which had good electrical conductivity and delivered 650 mA h g−1 over 80 cycles.251 Since the main raw material for electrospinning was a polymer, Nandan and co-workers prepared poly(styrene sulfonate)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–sulfur–polyacrylonitrile electrospun nanofibers, delivering a capacity of 41% after 500 cycles at 0.5C.252 It is worth noting that coating a polymer directly onto sulfur without co-heating was also a viable solution. Cui's group synthesized mono-PVP-encapsulated hollow sulfur nanospheres by exploiting the hydrophilicity of PVP (a soft template); this process is shown in Fig. 11a. The SEM image in Fig. 11b shows the hollow sphere architecture made of PVP coated on both the sides of sulfur and the sphere had some damage due to the gas generated during the reaction. The battery delivered good rate performance (at 0.1, 0.2, and 1C, the capacity retentions were 1179, 1018, and 990 mA h g−1, respectively).253 More meaningfully, as shown in the SEM and TEM images (Fig. 11c and d), Zhou's group reported a uniform polyaniline/sulfur composite with the yolk–shell structure, which delivered a capacity of 765 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.2C.254

(g–j) Chemical architecture for SPAN.261 Copyright 2014, MDPI AG. (k) Architecture and synthesis of carbyne LPSs.262 Copyright 2013, The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Secondly, a polymer was usually compounded with a metal-based material (described above) or carbon material as the matrix for use as a cathode in LSBs. Furthermore, polymer co-heating with sulfur after mixing with a carbon material could not only yield polar fixing to LPSs, but also improve system conductivity. Super P,255 CNTs,256 multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),257 porous CNTs,258 and GO259,260 have been used for this purpose. Among these materials, carbon materials tend to form a crosslinked conductive network with polymers-coated sulfur or carbon materials. Qian's group designed a graphene-coated biconical sulfur/polyaniline core–shell structure (S/PANI/GO) at low temperatures. As shown in the SEM images in Fig. 11e and f, sulfur initially exhibited a uniform monodisperse characteristic, which changed into a crosslinked structure after coating with PANI/GO. PANI provided polar adsorption for sulfur, while the crosslinked GO formed a conductive network that improved the conductivity of the system. A capacity of 875 mA h g−1 at 2C could be achieved after 100 cycles.261
Thirdly, a polymer bond with long-chain sulfur is very interesting. Since the covalent bond had a stronger binding force with respect to the polar fixing action, the dissolution of LPSs could be better suppressed. Wang's group co-heated elemental sulfur and a carbyne analog to fabricate carbyne LPSs, which possessed the stable architecture of conductive sp2-hybridized carbons. Since it could strongly connect to the sulfur side chain, LPSs could easily exist in the form of Li2S2 and Li2S instead of Li2Sx (2 < x ≤ 8); further, the capacity retention of the battery could be effectively improved (960 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.1C).262 As shown in Fig. 11g–j, Zhang's group reported the covalent bonding of cyclized, partially dehydrogenated, and ribbon-like polyacrylonitrile skeletons with short-chain Sx; the high performance of the battery could be attributed to the solid–solid single-phase redox reaction of the SPAN cathode material, which completely eliminated the shuttle effect of LPSs.263 Furthermore, Qian et al. synthesized a selenium-doped organic polymer (PDATtSSe) as per the process shown in Fig. 11k, which also yielded no long-chain Li2Sx during electrical cycling and had about 100% coulombic efficiency and satisfactory cycling stability (500 mA h g−1 after 400 cycles at 600 mA g−1).264
2.10. Summary of polar materials
Among polar materials, oxides are the most widely used due to their superior chemical adsorption capacity toward LPSs. For example, the binding energies of TiO2, T4O7,265 and MoO3 (ref. 114) between Li2S4 were 4.1, 4.2, and 2.85 eV, respectively. Titanium- and manganese-based oxides have several advantages in the synthesis methods due to their many crystal forms and their excellent adsorption in LPSs; they were the preferred oxides for use in LSBs. Some nitrides and oxides have similar adsorption capacities for LPSs. For instance, the binding energies of TiN266 and VN267 with Li2S4 are 2.48 and 3.27 eV, respectively. Transition metal nitrides not only have a good fixing effect toward LPSs, but also have good conductivity and catalytic conversion performance. Current research has been directed toward combining a nitride and oxide into forming a heterojunction as the host material for sulfur. Bimetal oxides such as Mg0.6Ni0.4O, NiCo2O4, and NiFe2O4 not only exhibit good conductivity and adsorption effect on LPSs, but also possess catalytic ability for conversion between LPSs and sulfur. By rationally designing the morphology, the sulfur content could be improved. Such materials have become popular in recent studies involving LSBs.
Among the sulfides, cobalt- and molybdenum-based sulfides have exhibited considerable conductivities and simultaneously yielded a worthwhile chemisorption effect. The valences of cobalt and molybdenum elements were different in sulfides, and the preparation method was relatively simple. Their morphologies could be controlled by the hydrothermal method, in situ synthesis method, and template method. Based on the above advantages, they have been favored by researchers.
Carbides have excellent electrical conductivity and have therefore been used to construct host materials for fabricating carbon-free sulfur. In particular, titanium-carbide-based two-dimensional MXenes have worthwhile adsorption in LPSs due to the surface modification of various polar groups.
The conductivity of hydroxides is not strong, but the polar group with an adsorption effect on LPSs was considerable. Therefore, it has a specific value. In terms of improving the overall performance of LSBs, a composite of carbide and oxide is better than only using a hydroxide.
The MOF material could directly provide a Lewis acid as a polar material to grow on the conductive material, and its graded pores could somewhat reduce the volume change in the material during the charge and discharge processes. Polar/nonpolar composites derived from MOF materials typically exhibit a hollow or porous structure that provide convenient storage sites for sulfur.
Polymers have many tunable parameters that can be effectively applied to LSBs. However, it is worth noting that most polymers still face challenges with regard to heat resistance that need to be resolved, while sulfur storage in polymers is limited. In particular, when the polymer and long-chain sulfur form a bond, although the properties are worthwhile, the amount of sulfur injected is poor.
3. Nonpolar materials
The conductivity of the matrix material is very important in LSB systems. Although a polar material has a good fixing effect in LPSs, it can suppress the side reactions caused by its dissolution. However, the conductivity of most polar materials is very poor, which can seriously reduce the kinetics of the system. Therefore, the conductivity of the matrix material and its contact area with sulfur would have an important influence on electron transport. Therefore, conductive carbon materials can facilitate electron transport. Considerable efforts have been focused toward selecting carbon materials with different architectures to provide a good conductive network, such as 1D, 2D, and 3D carbon materials, as well as their composites, in order to meet this challenge. At the same time, carbon materials with a hollow space or activated so that they contain numerous pores with different diameters, yielding good sulfur storage and enhanced electrochemical performance.
3.1. 1D carbon materials
A 1D carbon material (such as CNTs, MWCNTs, and CNFs) with a high aspect ratio can yield a more developed conductive network. Its advantages in the application of cathode materials could be comprehensively categorized as follows: (1) the high aspect ratio of a 1D material can yield high electrical conductivity along with robust architecture to ensure efficient charge and ion transport pathways; (2) 1D-material-interconnected architecture could accommodate ultrahigh sulfur content; (3) the use of 1D materials as matrix materials can be used to replace a binder and current collector, avoiding problems such as polymer binder degradation and metal foil corrosion.
In the matrix material of the cathodes of LSBs, the network of stacked CNTs provided worthwhile conductive architecture, while the good crystallinity ensured good electrical conductivity. Furthermore, CNTs with ideal conductivity (102–106 S m−1)270 could be prepared by the template and vapor deposition methods.271 Among the template methods, anodized aluminum (AAO) is one of the most commonly used templates for the preparation of CNTs. Wang et al. used AAO as the template, removed it by sodium hydroxide, and injected S6 and S2 into the tube through the CNTs wall via sulfur vapor infusion. As shown in Fig. 12a and b, since the template was removed, it was found that the CNTs/sulfur composite showed disordered chaotic accumulation, still retaining a capacity of 72.9% after 100 cycles.272 In order to preserve the good conductive architecture of AAO, Cui's group etched the template after injecting sulfur. As shown in Fig. 12c and d, not only was sulfur present in the nanotube, but the vertically aligned architecture of CNTs was also effectively maintained; a capacity of around 730 mA h g−1 was achieved after 150 cycles at 0.2C.273 Further, using AAO as the template, Cheng's group used acetylene gas to reduce the amount of sulfate attached to the template and then removed the template, synthesizing neat architecture that delivered 653 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1.5 A g−1.274 In order to increase the conductivity of CNTs, Wang and co-workers used copper particles as the catalytic metal to grow finer CNTs in the prepared CNTs by using AAO as the template, as shown in the TEM image (Fig. 12e). After injecting sulfur, Fig. 12f shows that sulfur was inside the large CNTs and was coated on the outside of the small CNTs; such architecture provided a conductive network for the internal sulfur, yielding 1146 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles.275 Due to the limited diameter of conventional CNTs, MWCNTs with large internal space and good electrical conductivity were also suitable for LSB systems. Manthiram's group used the CVD method to develop a flexible self-weaving MWCNTs matrix and then deposited elemental sulfur in situ by vacuum filtration, which yielded 1012 mA h g−1 at 4C and 1352 mA h g−1 at 1C.276 Subsequently, the pyrrole-coated sulfur/MWCNT composite277 and coaxial MWCNTs confined to porous CNTs278 were reported by Chen's and Xu's groups, respectively.

Furthermore, CNFs with a wide range of conductivities (10−7–103 S m−1)270 could also improve the electrochemical reaction kinetics of sulfur and promote sufficient reaction of sulfur because CNFs were more suitable for holding sulfur. Zhang's group used the electrostatic spinning method by mixing two polymers (PAN and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)). PAN was retained as a precursor and PMMA was removed as a pore generator in the calcination process, while the pores uniformly existed in various places of the fibers for storing sulfur; it still had a capacity of 987 mA h g−1 after 30 cycles.279 CNFs with parallel pipes prepared via carbonizing electrospun bicomponent nanofibers have also been used as cathode matrix materials.280 Lou's group reported controllable CNFs by changing the ratio of PAN and PS; the architecture of nanofibers could be changed. As shown in Fig. 13a, as the ratio of PS increases, the pipe diameter in the nanofiber became smaller and the number of pipes increases. When the ratio was 1:1, pipes also appeared on the surface of CNFs. When PAN:PS was 1:1.5, a high initial capacity of 1215 mA h g−1 could be achieved for the 1st cycle, which decreased at the rate of 0.1% per cycle during the next 200 cycles at 0.2C.281 Similarly, Cho and co-workers prepared a root-like hierarchical CNF material by the electrospinning method using PVP as the carbon source and silica as the in situ template. The interaction between the central gaps after the injection of sulfur (Fig. 13b) could effectively accommodate the volume change in sulfur; a capacity of 550 mA h g−1 could be retained after 300 cycles at 0.5C with sulfur loading of 4.8 mg cm−2 at the cathode.282 Although nanofibers provide good space for sulfur storage, carbonized polymers generally exhibit lower conductivity than that obtainable from carbon materials with higher crystallinity. Kim and co-workers increased the crystallinity of the nanofiber by loading Fe3C (catalytic when carbonized) on its surface and then removing Fe3C to increase the pores on the surface as well as to provide storage space for sulfur; a capacity of 553 mA h g−1 could be derived at 4C in the 200th cycle.283 Furthermore, in order to increase the conductivity of the 1D carbon material, Zuo's group used dispersion of rGO and sulfur nanoparticles that was cold-quenched with liquid nitrogen, followed by freeze-drying and heat treatment to fabricate a multilayer crimped graphene roll. As shown in the TEM image (Fig. 13c), in this architecture, sulfur was encapsulated in the cavity of the rGO nanovolume, yielding 505 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 2C.284 Meanwhile, Fang and co-workers prepared fibers comprising the yolk–shell architecture. The TEM image after sulfur loading is shown in Fig. 13d. Such architecture not only improved sulfur loading, but also increased the fixing of LPSs, which retained 700 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1C.285

3.2. 2D carbon materials
When compared with 1D carbon materials, 2D carbon materials based on graphene materials could also yield worthwhile conductivity (about 106 S m−1)270 for LSB systems, facilitating the transport of ions and electrons. Furthermore, they yielded a larger specific surface area, and their unique 2D architecture could provide sufficient space for sulfur loading, thereby improving sulfur utilization. Generally, graphene-based materials can be prepared via the following two strategies: (1) encapsulating sulfur particles into graphene-based materials; (2) injecting sulfur between the layers of graphene-based materials.
In order to ensure conductive GO encapsulates sulfur, Cui's group assembled polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated sulfur particles and carbon-black-coated GO sheets to form packaged architecture, as shown in Fig. 14a. A capacity of only 13% was lost during 10–100 cycles.286

Conductive graphene-based materials have interlayer voids that have been shown to be suitable as spaces for sulfur loading, and their fixing effects could be further enhanced by the modification of heterogeneous elements (N,287 B,288 S,289 and their combination290,291) and a functional group.292 Our group prepared a nitrogen-doped graphene material as the matrix material via a simple hydrothermal method. This novel cabbage-like morphology had joint architecture with unique fine grooves and fine folds that counteracted the defects of nonconductive sulfur species and enabled sulfur storage. After 300 cycles at 1C, it delivered a capacity of 663 mA h g−1.293 Liu and co-workers infiltrated the sulfur solution into solvated rGO membranes and prepared a separate rGO–S composite membrane by freeze-drying, which exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 1028 mA h g−1 and retained 65% capacity after 300 cycles at 0.1C.294 Furthermore, Li's group controlled and vertically grew sulfur and graphene on the surface of a conductive matrix by cyclic voltammetry; in particular, sulfur nanoparticles were uniformly fixed between the graphene layers, which delivered good rate performance.295 Zhang and co-workers prepared the NaSx solvent by the following reaction: “Na2S + (x − 1)S → Na2Sx”. Later, they prepared S particles by the following reaction: “Sx2− + 2H+ → (x − 1)S + H2S” and successfully dispersed it between the GO layers, which exhibited a capacity of about 954 mA h g−1 at 2C.296 Chen's group used rGO sheets and multifunctional additive poly(anthraquinonyl sulfide) and nanosulfur to create freestanding cathode architecture that maintained 559 mA h g−1 at 0.5C after 1200 cycles.297 Similarly, Shi's group coated rGO on thermally exfoliated graphene nanosheets and sulfur stack-up nanocomposites, which exhibited 667 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at about 0.95C.298 Wang et al. synthesized highly pleated nitrogen-doped mesoporous graphene via a simple thermal expansion method using GO as the precursor and cyanamide as the nitrogen source and porogen (Fig. 14b), which exhibited 1210 mA h g−1 after 120 cycles at 4C.299 In order to increase the space for sulfur loading, Zhao et al. coated graphene with SiO2 (Fig. 14c) and prepared a blackberry hollow graphene sphere after etching SiO2 (Fig. 14d), which guaranteed sulfur loading of 73.5% (the TEM image of the matrix after sulfur injection is shown in Fig. 14e).300 Importantly, Zhang et al. used low-defect graphene with composite sulfur having ultrahigh conductivity (2.05 × 105 S m−1), which showed impressive capacity retention (519 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2C).301
3.3. 3D carbon materials
Although both 1D and 2D materials with good crosslinking architecture could provide good conductivity networks, there was still contact resistance between the monomers. Therefore, it was imperative to prepare 3D interconnected carbon materials. At present, graphene hydrogels,302 graphene aerogels,303 inverse opal carbon materials, and other template methods have delivered 3D interconnected carbon materials and have seen tremendous progress.
Yang and co-workers prepared a dense conductive graphene hydrogel by liquid phase compression using graphene hydrogel as the precursor; this was used as a conductive matrix material after activation (dense and closed pores (Fig. 15a and b) for better storage of sulfur and LPSs), delivering 770 mA h g−1 (0.5C) after 300 cycles.304 Wang's group used H2S as a sulfur source as well as a reducing agent for GO to fabricate a high-density rGO/sulfur module from a hydrogel composed of rGO/sulfur tablets after evaporation-induced drying. It had a highly shrinking and nonporous texture, which guaranteed very high sulfur loading (94 wt%).305

Aerogels have a rich crosslinked conductive network along with being ultralight, soft, and highly porous, which are suitable for use as a cathode matrix material for LSBs. Fang and co-workers used a non-alkali strategy to prepare a layered porous graphene aerogel with abundant macropores, mesopores, and micropores by using an unconventional hydrothermal reaction and heat treatment (avoiding freeze-drying and supercritical drying). After compounding with sulfur (78.3 wt%), the material still yielded capacities of 619 and 589 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 and 1C, respectively.306 Zhou's group mixed HCl with dispersion of sodium thiosulfate and GO and prepared 3D porous architecture of an aerogel with in situ deposited sulfur by a simple self-assembly method; the sulfur loading values ranged from 4.2 to 22.2 mg cm−2.307 Furthermore, Zhang et al. used a graphene aerogel and activated carbon to fabricate stable 3D network architecture for use as the matrix for LSBs, which delivered 583 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 1C.308 Cavallo's group prepared a rGO aerogel by freeze-drying rGO hydrogel, which yielded 3.4 mA h cm−2 after 350 cycles at 0.1C after dropping fluorine-free Li2S8.309
CF having foam-like conductive architecture was an important part of 3D interconnected carbon materials when used as the matrix for LSBs. Zhang's group reported a modified Pechini method that retained the organic reagents as a carbon source and successfully synthesized CF with a high specific surface area (able to hold 57.2 wt% sulfur) and rich in mesopores, which retained 878 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles.310 Huang's group prepared nitrogen-doped graphene foam by the solvothermal method, yielding 672 mA h g−1 at 1500 mA g−1 (after 200 cycles) after loading 87.6 wt% sulfur.311 Ye et al. used melamine as a carbon and nitrogen source to prepare separate nitrogen-doped graphene foam by annealing in a CVD furnace, maintaining 440 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 2C.144 Further, Cheng's group used Ni foam as a template to form graphene-foam-based flexible cathode matrix materials (Fig. 15c and d), which yielded a worthwhile areal capacity (13.4 mA h cm−2) for 10.1 mg cm−2 of sulfur loading.312 Furthermore, using the templating method, Pei's group used a porous metal skeleton (via the one-step thermal reduction of metal salt) as the template and then prepared graphene foam as a matrix via the CVD method, yielding 400 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles at 0.1C.313 The inverse opal architecture was a promising 3D interconnected carbon material due to its highly ordered crosslinked architecture and controlled pore size. Zhang's group prepared an inverse opal framework with mesopores on it by the in situ self-assembly of colloidal polymers and silica spheres and using sucrose as the carbon source; this yielded a capacity of 884 mA h g−1 (50 cycles at 0.1C). As shown in Fig. 15e and f, the matrix material exhibited long-range ordered microporous architecture. When sulfur was injected, it was uniformly loaded onto the frameworks.314 In addition, Zhu et al. experimentally proved that the inverse opal architecture could simultaneously modify the cathode and anode and could improve the performance of LSBs; this material retained 397 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 1C.315
Other 3D carbon crosslinked materials were also structurally unique. Manthiram's group formed a 3D skeleton by coating sulfur with carbon black, retaining 777 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles.316 Hu's group distributed rGO in the pores of wood by suction filtration to form a well-conducting 3D skeleton (as shown in Fig. 15g and h), yielding a high specific area capacity (15.2 mA h cm−2) in the case of high-loading sulfur (21.3 mg cm−2).317 In addition, the preparation of porous 3D interconnected carbon materials using P2O5 (ref. 318) and CaCO3 (ref. 319) as the templates was also used for preparing the matrix materials.

3.3.1 3D carbon materials with pores (>1 nm). 
It should be emphasized that conductive 3D materials were usually combined with pores, and the different specific surface areas of the pores on the conductive networks could physically fix LPSs within a certain range (achieved by the van der Waals force). In terms of pore size distribution, the primary categories are mesopores (2–50 nm), macropores (greater than 50 nm), micropores (less than 2 nm), and hierarchical pores (combinations of these categories).
A good 3D conductive network combined with mesopores yields good electrical conductivity with a certain amount of physical adsorption. The pioneering work on mesoporous materials in LSBs was done by Nazar and co-workers, who used CMK-3 as a cathode to inject sulfur by the melt diffusion method; this successfully limited the dissolution of LPSs.320 After discovering the potential of mesoporous materials for use as the cathode for LSBs, carbonizing biological materials became a popular method to obtain mesoporous materials. Materials such as rice,321 litchi shells,322 corn cobs,323 coconut shells,324 crab shells,325 and wood microfibers326 were successfully employed. In particular, Wang's group used natural wood as the precursor to produce functionalized carbonized mesoporous wood fiber, which retained a high capacity of 859 mA h g−1 after 450 cycles. However, different mesoporous materials possess different pore sizes with different specific surface areas. In order to determine the suitable parameters affecting the performance of the cathode, Li's group used the hard template method to fabricate a series of mesoporous carbon materials with different pore sizes (22, 12, 7, and 3 nm) and specific surface areas (from 889 to 1448 cm2 g−1). Interestingly, their results revealed that although the carbon materials have different pore sizes and specific surface areas, the battery performance of each group of materials was almost the same after complete sulfur filling. At the same time, the partially filled sulfur/carbon electrode showed better performance.327 Similar pore diameters (2 and 22 nm) were also obtained by Li's group; they synthesized peapod-like mesoporous carbon by using colloidal silica spheres as the hard template and polybenzoxazine as the precursor with high sulfur loading of 84 wt%. The morphology of the material before and after sulfur injection is shown in Fig. 16a and b.328 Piao and co-workers reported honeycomb-like ordered mesoporous carbon nanosheets by the etching of iron oxide nanocubes/carbon hybrid nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 16c and d. Due to the unique 2D porous architecture with suitable pore size (15–20 nm) and sufficient surface area (386.7 m2 g−1), an excellent electrochemical performance could be achieved with a capacity 506 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles.329 Highly ordered mesopores with uniform distribution of sulfur were also needed for LSBs. Fan et al. synthesized mesoporous carbon–sulfur composites with appropriate sulfur distribution and high sulfur content (70 wt%) by using a simple electrodeposition method, as evident in the TEM image (Fig. 16e); the material had highly ordered mesoporous (∼8 nm) architecture. After the sulfur was injected, the sulfur could be uniformly distributed in the material, as shown in the TEM (Fig. 16f) image obtained by EDS mapping, ensuring highly stable capacity at 851 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles.330

(g) Schematic illustration of the electrochemical processes of hierarchical porous carbon.335 Copyright 2014, American Chemical Society. 
In hierarchical porous materials, at least two types of pores—macropores, mesopores, or micropores—were present in the synthesized materials. The 3D architecture of the materials could yield a good conductive network, and the complementary features between the different pore sizes provided conditions for storing sulfur and physically adsorbing LPSs. This material was commonly obtained by carbonizing biomass and activating with KOH, such as lotus seedpod shells,331 banana peels,332 walnut shells,333 bamboo,5Cyclosorus interruptus,334 and tobacco stem,335 which were fully explored in this respect. It is worth noting that some noncarbon elements, such as N, O, S, etc., which were retained during the process of carbonizing biomass, played a role in the chemical fixing of LPSs. In particular, Wang's group obtained mesoporous–microporous carbon by carbonizing the walnut shell and then activated it with KOH; they found that the low carbonization temperature with high KOH concentration resulted in more appropriate architecture, which showed high initial capacity (1375 mA h g−1) and stable cycling performance (943 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5C).
Due to the lack of universality of biological materials, the preparation of hierarchical porous materials by chemical synthesis was studied. Geng and co-workers used Na2S as the sulfur source and NaCl and Na2S as the templates to synthesize microporous–mesoporous carbon, exhibiting a long cycle life with attenuation of only 0.039% per cycle at a high rate of 2C after 1000 cycles.336 In addition, Zhang et al. synthesized a 9 nm mesoporous wall and 300 nm crosslinked macroporous architecture, similar to that of inverse opal, which was in situ self-assembled with a colloidal polymer and silica spheres; sucrose was used as the carbon source. Elemental sulfur was mainly impregnated in the mesoporous wall so that the architecture was effectively maintained, and it exhibited a high initial discharge capacity (1193 mA h g−1).314 It is worth noting that large pores were not completely utilized in the above architecture; in particular, Choi's group reported hierarchical porous carbon architecture where the mesopores and macropores were surrounded by micropores on the outside. As shown in Fig. 16g, sulfur was mainly stored in the macropores and mesopores, yielding a reversible capacity. Regardless of whether sulfur was present in the micropores or not, the micropores acted as a barrier in LPS dissolution, thereby yielding an initial capacity of 1412 mA h g−1 with 77% capacity retention after 500 cycles.337 Similarly, Chen and co-workers combined the salt template (ZnCl2) and hard template (colloidal silica) to produce hierarchical porous (microporous, mesoporous and macroporous) nitrogen-doped carbon and interconnected three-dimensional network architectures as the matrix for LSBs.338 In addition, layered or sheet architecture with hierarchical pores have also been comprehensively studied. Zhang's group used layered carbides as precursors for preparing layered porous architecture of carbon for use as matrix materials.339 Fang et al. used Mg(OH)2 as the self-template and CVD method to prepare carbon rods with graphene-like hierarchical porous nanosheets, which yielded a capacity decrease of only 0.046% per cycle from the 30th to 300th cycle.340 Furthermore, the carbon sphere comprising layered porous nanosheets not only had a high tap density, but also the pores in the sheet and gap between them were worthwhile sulfur-holding places. Liu and co-workers prepared hierarchical porous HC using aminated mesoporous silica as the template and sucrose as the carbon source. Sulfur could be stored in the external cone-like cavities, porous carbon shell, and hollow interior. In particular, this material could still exhibit a very low capacity decrease (0.047% per cycle after 1200 cycles at 0.5C) when sulfur loading reached 75 wt%.341 Zheng's group used the composites of nitrogen-doped porous carbon, rGO, and CNTs to prepare a conductive carbon network, which not only increased the conductivity of the system, but also increased the sulfur loading through the internal space and provided a barrier for limiting the dissolution of LPSs. After loading sulfur, a capacity of 414 mA h g−1 could be achieved after 1000 cycles at 3C.342
In summary, combining pores with a 3D conductive network met the need of good electrical conductivity of the sulfur species and provided more meaningful holding space for sulfur. An ordered pore with pore size greater than 1 nm could shorten the ion transfer path and provide sufficient surface area for the injected sulfur. However, from the viewpoint of suppressing the dissolution of LPSs, this simple structure could not achieve high LSB performance. The use of different templates to prepare the matrix with pores of different sizes has been investigated,343,344 revealing that the rational use of different combinations with different pore sizes can considerably increase sulfur loading as well as the electrochemical performance. Meaningfully, pores could provide a short Li-ion transport path and large void space for LSBs toward volume expansion during the charge and discharge processes. Due to the poor physical adsorption of the van der Waals-based carbon materials, it is worthwhile to comprehensively study doped carbon materials and growing polar materials to provide more efficient assistance in inhibiting the dissolution of LPSs.


3.3.2 3D carbon materials with smaller micropores (<1 nm). 
Meaningfully, when the pore size is smaller than 1 nm, the matrix will have a completely different function. In this case, S8 cannot enter the pores due to its size; therefore, the formation of long-chain LPSs could be successfully prevented. In such architectures, sulfur is mostly present in the form of S2–4. Further, it has different charge and discharge curves as compared to those of conventional LSBs mentioned before (as shown in Fig. 17).345 These types of LSBs possess only one redox peak and the initial ring has a significant hysteresis effect that can be interpreted as follows: sulfur and carbon or surface-bound oxygen form a special sulfur complex embedded in the pores between sulfur and lithium during discharge. The electrochemical reaction requires additional energy to destroy this complex discharge voltage.346 Researchers have conducted extensive research on this in order to prevent the formation of LPSs via suitable pore size design.

Yuan's group calculated the molecular sizes of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethylene carbonate (EC) and compared them with respect to the pore size (Fig. 18a). Micropores increased the steric hindrance of electrolyte penetration into the carbon matrix, resulting in the loss of contact between sulfur and the electrolyte. A “quasi-solid reaction” confirmed that micropores could successfully avoid the production of soluble LPSs, as shown in Fig. 18b.347 In their work, Gao's group mixed sulfur and microporous (1–2 nm) carbon spheres (as shown in the TEM and HRTEM images in Fig. 18c and d) and heated them to enclose sulfur in the micropores, retaining 650 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 400 mA g−1 with 42 wt% sulfur.348 Similarly, the use of different materials as the starting material to fabricate microporous matrix materials was also impressive, such as sucrose,349 glucose with GO,345 and polyvinylidene-dichloride-based carbon.350 Guo's group used MWCNTs (diameter: 50 nm) as the starting material to fabricate a microporous carbon material (pore size: 0.5 nm); thereafter, S2–4 was evenly loaded. A high initial capacity (1670 mA h g−1) and stable cycling capacity (1149 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.1C) could be achieved.351 Yuan et al. prepared microporous carbon materials by the organic–organic assembly and carbonization method, as shown in Fig. 18e. After loading 40% sulfur, almost no sulfur was scattered on the surface of the material, yielding more than 600 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles (400 mA g−1). They further loaded sulfur up to 60%, and sulfur appeared on the surface (Fig. 18f), showing a lower specific capacity.347

It is worth noting that since this microporous (<1 nm) matrix effectively prevented the formation of long-chain LPSs, the capacity retention ratio was more stable than that for the cathode based on S8. Therefore, it allowed the use of more mature and inexpensive carbonate solutions as electrolytes to a certain extent. Every coin had two sides: its theoretical capacity was lower than that of S8, and it was difficult to achieve a very high ratio of sulfur at the cathode. Therefore, the effective ratio of controlling the appearance of micropores in the matrix was worth exploring.

3.4. Composites with different dimensions
Carbon materials of various dimensions had different characteristics, and combining them could further improve the performance of LSBs. As shown in Fig. 19a–c, Yu's group used commercial NF, glucose, and dicyandiamide (DCDA) as the substrates as well as carbon and nitrogen sources, and they used solid-state growth methods to produce high-nitrogen-doped CNT/graphene (1D/2D) hybrids as the cathode matrix for LSBs. After compositing with sulfur, a capacity of 896 mA h g−1 could be achieved after 200 cycles at 2C.352 Similarly, Li's and Zhu's groups pyrolyzed urea on graphene nanosheets (with Co2+)353 and pyrolyzed cation-exchanged (Ni2+/Co2+-exchanged) resins on graphene architectures, respectively.354 Consequently, a similar 1D/2D mixed material was prepared. In addition to growing CNTs on the surface of graphene-based materials, it was also a viable strategy to grow them on the surface of MOFs-based materials. Using ZnCo–ZIFs as the precursor, Liu's group synthesized monodisperse urchin-like Co and N double-doped CNTs/nanopolyhedral architectures as a new high-performance sulfur host (maintaining 657 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5C) for Li–S batteries.355 In order to further increase the degree of crosslinking in the material, Xie et al. synthesized a sulfur holder where porous carbon nanoparticles derived from ZIF-67 were interconnected through CNTs as LSBs.356 Otherwise, the dispersion of monodisperse individuals (particularly those with hollow architectures) on the surface of 2D materials would also improve the performance. Piao's group synthesized monodisperse carbon nanocapsules immobilized on graphene nanosheets (MCNC/G) composites, as shown in Fig. 19d and e, which delivered 524 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5C.357

3.5. Interfacial design of carbon materials
It should be emphasized that the above discussion focused on the application of carbon-based materials for forming conductive networks, and the modification of nonpolar carbon materials via atomic doping and using functional groups could not only develop the conductivity of carbon materials, but also achieve good anchoring effect for LPSs.358
The current work mainly focused on single-atom and diatomic doping dominated by N atoms. In earlier works involving single-atom doping, Zhang et al. calcined graphene under the flow of NH3 gas in a tube furnace, producing N-doped graphene for sulfur holding; a capacity of 987 mA h g−1 was delivered at 0.2C after 150 cycles. Further, they calculated that the binding energies of N-doped graphene with Li, Li2S, Li2S4, Li2S6, and Li2S8 were 4.41, 2.10, 1.48, 2.08, and 1.82 eV, respectively, which were higher than the corresponding values for primitive graphene (1.81, 0.60, 0.25, 0.36, and 0.50 eV).359 In order to obtain an N-doped carbon material, the method of calcining N-containing materials with carbon materials was found. For example, ammonia solution,311 ethylenediamine,360 urea,360 EDTA hydrate,361 and cyanamide299 were used for mixing with carbon materials in order to co-heat the preparation of the abovementioned N-doped carbon. Meanwhile, a method to directly carbonize the N-containing precursor was an efficient means to prepare N-doped carbon materials.362 Manthiram's group used a hollow TiO2 sphere as the template and polydopamine as the carbon and nitrogen source to prepare a double-shell N-doped carbon sphere to dual-confine sulfur. After mixing with the conductive network of graphene at the cathode, a capacity of 520 mA h g−1 could be achieved after 200 cycles at 0.5C.363 In order to further increase the conductivity of carbon-based materials and the adsorption of LPSs, other types of atoms were introduced into the N-doped carbon materials. For example, N- and S-,364–366 N- and P-, and N- and O-codoped carbon materials were comprehensively investigated in this respect. Wang's group successfully prepared honeycomb-like N- and S-codoped hierarchical porous carbon derived from lotus seeds by simple pyrolysis and hydrothermal methods, which delivered 952 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles at 0.5C.367 Zheng's group prepared novel N- and P-codoped conductive carbon materials derived from silk fibroin via H3PO4 activation via high-temperature pyrolysis. It was used as the sulfur host and interlayer, delivering 758 mA h g−1 at 2C.368 Huang et al. designed N- and P-codoped hierarchically porous carbon materials for sulfur holding, which yielded 499 mA h g−1 at 5C.369 Manthiram's group developed N- and O-codoped carbon hollow CNFs via the activation and carbonization of a PPy precursor, which exhibited 831 mA h g−1 at C/3 after 400 cycles.370 Meaningfully, the diatomic-doped carbon material synthesized by Tao et al. did not contain elemental N. They successfully prepared B- and O-codoped MWCNTs by using B2O3 as the B and O source; DFT calculations further proved that B and O doping could provide a large number of adsorption sites, delivering 428 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1.371 In terms of triatomic doping, Lin's group successfully synthesized N-, O-, and P-codoped broccoli-like hierarchical porous carbon by using natural and readily available mountain wool as the carbon source with H3PO4 activation and high-temperature carbonization. When it was composited with sulfur for use as the cathode, it delivered 489 mA h g−1 at 0.2C after 300 cycles.372 Atomic doping was a promising method that increased the conductivity of carbon materials and simultaneously provided chemical anchoring.
Otherwise, functionalizing carbon materials was an effective method to add the chemical anchoring effect.292 In an early work, Zhang et al. discovered that graphene oxide with hydroxyl and epoxy groups exhibited anchoring to LPSs, which could effectively limit the dissolution of LPSs.296 Fiber-like graphene373 and porous graphene374 with rich hydroxyl and epoxy groups have been comprehensively studied. Manthiram's group synthesized hydroxylated graphene nanosheets with NaOH, showing impressive performance (1021 and 955 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 and 1C, respectively).292 Combining hydroxylated carbon material with doping elements were reasonable designs. From this level, elemental doping could further improve the conductivity of the carbon material, and both of them could further induce the anchoring effect of the carbon material for LPSs. Manthiram's group synthesized hydroxylated N-doped CNTs via the free radical polymerization and subsequent activation methods. When it was combined with sulfur for use as the cathode, the as-prepared battery delivered 754 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5C.375 In conclusion, this rational approach to the surface design of carbon materials could increase the conductivity as well as simultaneously improve the anchoring effect.
3.6. Summary of nonpolar materials
1D carbon materials, especially CNTs and MWCNTs with high crystallinity, possess good electrical conductivity, but the storage of sulfur using only tubular structures can be limited. CNFs could be prepared by controlling electrospinning to prepare parallel tubular structures or by activation to yield different pore sizes, but the difference in crystallinity resulted in marginal conductivity of the monomers.
2D graphene-based materials possess good electrical conductivity, and they can store sulfur in the spaces between the graphene sheets or activated pore architecture. This material has potential, but its preparation cost is high, particularly when the number of layers is low; this can restrict its large-scale application in LSBs.
3D materials have a large area of conductive networks relative to 1D and 2D materials, which can considerably reduce contact resistance between the monomers. However, amorphous 3D carbon materials prepared from carbonized biomaterials and polymerization itself are not highly conductive, which would restrict their structural conductivity.
Their composite materials can complement each other's strengths and are a promising approach. However, carbon materials had the characteristics of poor fixing effect for LPSs. Therefore, in addition to doping to provide certain active sites and increasing conductivity, it was a good way to compound with polar materials, particularly when carbon materials were combined with conductive polar materials could probably guarantee performance with increased adsorption.
4. Conclusion and perspectives
For LSBs, the inefficient conversion of soluble LPSs and inability to reuse insoluble Li2S2/Li2S remain the biggest problems that ultimately lead to low energy efficiency and short cycle life of the battery, preventing the commercialization of LSBs. In addition, the poor conductivity of sulfur leads to unsatisfactory rate performance of LSBs. Therefore, a satisfactory host material for sulfur is imperative to have strong attraction toward LPSs, and it can promote the conversion of LPSs, while also having strong conductivity. The solutions proposed by researchers toward resolving this problem can be roughly summarized into three directions: (1) based on the consideration of LPSs with polar molecules, elemental sulfur and polar metals (e.g., oxides, sulfides, carbides, nitrides, hydroxides, metal catalysts, etc.) are composited together, as shown in Tables 1–4. The material forms a composite that enhances the chemisorption of LPSs. (2) A method of constructing a physical barrier such as a coating or skeleton structure can suppress the elution of LPSs and improve conductivity (Table 5). (3) A combination of polar and nonpolar materials can realize the ability to fix LPSs with improved electrical conductivity.

Recently, there have been several promising polar materials that can combine the ability to conduct electricity and fix LPSs. For example, TiC has frequently been used in LSBs in the recent years, and the 2D materials constructed with it can be equipped with a variety of polar groups to fix LPSs. In addition, TiC-based 2D materials have a certain catalytic ability.
Among nonpolar materials, carbon materials have been widely used in LSBs, such as CNTs, CNFs, and carbon spheres. In the recent years, graphene has been increasingly used, and polar materials have always been coated with a single or several layers of graphene. The research direction of adding polar-group-modified graphene to composite materials has recently become a research hotspot. At the same time, the construction of a carbon material with a reasonable pore size in order to use a physical force to fix LPSs has gradually become a popular topic.
The combination of polar materials and nonpolar materials uniformly provides the advantages of fixing LPSs and good electrical conductivity; until now, polymers were coated on the surface of a polar material as the carbon source. Methods involving polar materials embedded into carbon materials such as CNTs, CNFs, and porous carbon spheres or conductive polymers, as well as growing polar material arrays on conductive nonpolar materials, have been extensively performed. MOFs, which are porous and easily synthesized and regulated, have recently been increasingly used in LSB research. As a precursor, it can easily combine carbon and polar materials. In addition, as a polar material that can provide a Lewis acid site, it can also be directly bonded to a carbon material, which can effectively support sulfur due to its graded pore size.
Although researchers have performed comprehensive research in resolving the shuttle effect, there are still several directions for further improvement in order to realize the applications of LSBs.
Further investigations are needed for the sulfur-fixing mechanism of polar materials. Although the chemical reaction process of the charge and discharge processes in LSBs has been revealed, the mechanism of material conversion in batteries needs to be further understood. An understanding of the electrochemical conversion process and fixing process in LSBs is beneficial for guiding the design of high-performance LSBs.
For cathode materials or the construction of multifunctional separators for use in LSBs, enhanced conversion rates of soluble LPSs and insoluble Li2S2/Li2S are the keys to resolving the shuttle effect. Therefore, reasonable construction of composite materials employing a combination of chemical and physical interactions for improved absorption in LPSs is a worthy direction for further study. Realizing a larger proportion of sulfur at the cathode along with its efficient use needs further research.
In addition, building a host material with higher sulfur content and simultaneously improving the utilization rate of sulfur is the key to construct LSBs with long life, high cycling rates, and good stability. Starting from the source of the materials, selecting low-cost and high-yield materials is the key to reducing the cost of manufacturing LSBs, while taking into account environmentally friendly issues. These challenges need further research.
