    , Accepted 28th October 2013First published on 29th October 2013AbstractZinc sulfide (ZnS) nanomaterials with well-defined mesoporosity were synthesized with the assistance of sonochemistry in an ethanol system of Zn(NO3)2 and Na2S, without using any templates or surfactants. The prepared ZnS presented a crystalline structure of the cubic zinc-blende phase and possessed a high specific surface area of 263 m2 g−1 with a narrow pore size distribution around 5.1 nm. Abundant surface defects existed in the obtained mesoporous ZnS, thanks to the NaNO3 salt protection through the process of occasional precipitation in the alcohol system. Sonochemically synthesized ZnS nanomaterials showed higher activities for the photodegradation of Rhodamine B under UV light irradiation than the ones prepared in the absence of sonochemistry or in an aqueous system, which was mainly due to the well-structured mesoporosity and the surface defects.
1 Introduction
Semiconductor nanomaterials have attracted a lot of interest due to their unique optical and electronic properties for practical applications. Among various semiconductor materials, much effort has been made to fabricate group II–VI binary semiconductors possessing attractive optical properties over the last few decades.1–6 ZnS is an important semiconductor with band gap energy of 3.80 eV for the hexagonal wurtzite phase and 3.66 eV for the cubic zinc-blende phase.7 Since the size, morphology and dimensionality can strongly affect the properties of nanostructured materials, plenty of low-dimensional ZnS nanostructures have been prepared, for instance, quantum dots,8 nanorods,9 nanoribbons,10 and nanotubes.11 In addition, ZnS nanostructured assemblies including solid nanospheres,12 hollow nanospheres13 and nanowire/nanobelt arrays14 have been synthesized, and their applications were extended in the field of photocatalysis,15 phosphors,16 and so on. Nevertheless, the conventional synthesis of ZnS nanomaterials often requires organic capping agents, organic solvent, high-temperature treatment, and/or an atmosphere of inert gas for protection, and is complicated and energy-intensive to a certain extent.
Porous semiconductor photocatalysts offer huge potential for the elimination of toxic chemicals, through minimizing the distance between the site of photon absorption and electron–hole redox reactions to improve efficiency.17 Indeed, catalysts with higher surface areas, larger porosities and nanoscale particle sizes could provide more reactive sites, so as to enhance the catalytic activity.18 Mesoporous semiconductor materials have been successfully and widely employed as photocatalysts for the removal of contaminants.15,19 More recently, mesoporous ZnS thin films were prepared by the combination of a nanocasting approach and a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) process for the infiltration.20 Jang et al. fabricated mesoporous ZnS nanoplates by the calcination of a ZnS(en)0.5 complex (en = ethylenediamine), while ethylenediamine was used as a single solvent during the solvothermal process.7 Zhu and co-workers reported a biomolecule-assisted synthesis of ZnS nanostructured spheres assembled from ZnS nanocrystals, and the optical properties of ZnS nanostructured spheres were investigated by UV-vis absorption and PL spectra.21 However, the utilization of templates or surfactants in the synthesis process and the corresponding high cost inhibit the further application of mesoporous ZnS materials, and the removal of templates or surfactants demands additional energy and may also cause possible damage to the porous structures. Muruganandham et al. reported the self-assembled synthesis of pore-tunable, mesoporous ZnS microspheres by a hydrothermal route without using any templates or catalysts on a large scale, but their BET surface area was low (only about 40 m2 g−1).22 It is therefore still a challenge to develop facile methods for the synthesis of mesoporous ZnS nanomaterials with relatively large specific surface areas and fine mesoporosity.
The sonochemical method has been extensively employed to generate novel materials with unusual properties and proven to be efficient for preparing nanomaterials in a short period of time.23 Physical and chemical effects during the period of ultrasonic irradiation for fragmentation to small particles, acceleration of the reaction and production of new materials with novel properties is desirable.24 Hierarchical structured zinc oxides were synthesized at room temperature using ultrarapid sonochemistry, and used as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells, showing high photoelectric conversion efficiency of up to 6.42% under simulated sunlight irradiation.25 The sonochemical synthesis of nanocrystals embedded in CdS/ZnS/In2S3 complex microspheres has been reported.26 ZnS nanorods were fabricated by sonicating an ethylenediamine solution of elemental S and zinc acetate under ambient conditions.27 However, currently, many problems still exist in the conventional processing of ZnS nanomaterials, especially toxicity and tedious fabrication procedures, and the major applications of zinc sulfide are subject to the poor porosity. It is disappointing that little has been reported on one-step synthesis of mesoporous ZnS with a high specific surface area and well-defined mesoporosity by an ultrasonic irradiation route. In this paper, the novel approach of a sonochemistry-assisted salt-extraction (SASE) route under ambient conditions was designed to obtain mesoporous ZnS with a high surface area and fine porosity. The prepared mesoporous ZnS nanomaterials resulting from the zinc sulfide nanoparticle assembly presented significant defect-related optical properties, namely photoluminescence properties and good photocatalytic activity.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials and preparation
All chemicals were analytical grade and used as received without any further purification. Zinc nitrate (Zn(NO3)2), sodium sulfide (Na2S), and absolute ethanol were purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Chemical Co. Deionized water was used during the experiment process.
In a typical synthesis procedure, 45 mL of Na2S ethanol solution (30 mmol L−1) was added dropwise into an equal amount of Zn(NO3)2 ethanol solution (30 mmol L−1) under mild stirring for 15 min at room temperature. The obtained mixture was then immediately immersed in an ultrasonic water bath, accompanied by mechanical stirring, and the temperature was maintained at 25 °C. Irradiation by ultrasonic waves with a power of 100 W for 5 min was employed, followed by a further stirring of the mixture for several hours. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and denoted as p-ZnS. This as-synthesized ZnS deposit was washed by water and ethanol several times, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 6 h. The resulting sample was denoted as s-ZnS. The preparation under similar conditions but without ultrasound irradiation was also performed, and the obtained solid was denoted as n-ZnS for simplicity. For comparison, a ZnS sample was also synthesized in an aqueous solution with the assistance of ultrasonic irradiation, and was labeled w-ZnS.
2.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on a Joel JSF-7500L at an acceleration voltage of 5.0 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a Jeol JEM 2100F at 200 kV. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). The samples were degassed at 120 °C overnight prior to the measurement. The surface area was obtained by the multi-point Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the pore size distribution was calculated from the isotherm by the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) modeling method. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD (delay line detector) spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The XPS survey spectra were recorded with a pass energy of 160 eV, and high-resolution spectra with a pass energy of 40 eV. Binding energies were calibrated by using the containment carbon (C 1s 284.6 eV). Thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed on a TA SDT Q600 instrument at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in air using α-Al2O3 as the reference. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was measured at ambient temperature on a Hitachi F-4500 FL fluorescence spectrophotometer. The excitation wavelength was 320 nm and the PMT voltage was 700 V.
2.3 Photocatalytic testing
The photocatalytic activity of the prepared ZnS materials was evaluated by the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) dye under UV-light irradiation. 6 mg of the ZnS sample powder was placed into a tubular quartz reactor with 100 mL of RhB aqueous solution (10 μmol L−1). A 125 W UV lamp with maximum emission at 365 nm was located 10 cm higher than the solution surrounded by a circulating water tube. The suspensions were magnetically stirred in the dark for 1 hour to ensure the establishment of an adsorption–desorption equilibrium, and then exposed to UV-light irradiation at room temperature, with mild stirring. At given time intervals, about 5 mL of liquid was sampled, and centrifuged for 5 min to discard any sediment. The absorbance of the reaction solutions was measured on an SP-722 spectrometer at λmax = 554 nm.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structure and textural properties
The synthesis of mesoporous ZnS materials was performed easily by mixing low-concentration ethanol solutions of Zn(NO3)2 and Na2S, followed by ultrasound irradiation treatment in some cases only. The XRD patterns of the synthesized products are shown in Fig. 1. The as-synthesized sample p-ZnS presents strong and sharp diffraction peaks of NaNO3 (JCPDS no. 36-1417) and wide diffraction peaks of the cubic zinc-blende phase (JCPDS no. 65-0309). This reveals that NaNO3 was precipitated with ZnS synchronously during the fabrication process due to the low solubility of NaNO3 in the ethanol (solubility at ambient temperature: 0.029 g in 100 mL absolute ethanol). However, for the ZnS sample prepared in an aqueous solution, only ZnS precipitate could be obtained due to the higher solubility of NaNO3 in water (about 85 g in 100 mL water). The diffractions of s-ZnS, n-ZnS and w-ZnS are very similar, being in good agreement with the cubic zinc-blende phase. The broadening of the diffraction peaks suggests the very small size of the ZnS nanoparticles.23,28 The average crystallite sizes of s-ZnS, n-ZnS and w-ZnS are estimated to be 3.8, 7.2 and 3.6 nm, respectively, according to the Scherrer formula based on the (111) peak situated at 2θ = 28.9° with the highest strength. Interestingly, the crystallite sizes of the s-ZnS and w-ZnS nanoparticles are so small that the diffractions are much broader and weaker than those of n-ZnS, indicating the effect of sonochemical treatment on the growth of the nanomaterials. Also, it is noted that a further extension of ultrasonic irradiation to 20 min during the preparation process resulted in a very small variation of the diffraction patterns (Fig. S1, ESI†), although a decrease of the ZnS average crystallite size from 7.2 to 3.8 nm could be obtained after ultrasonic irradiation treatment for 5 min.

Fig. 2 shows representative SEM images of the prepared s-ZnS and n-ZnS materials, demonstrating numerous nanoparticles of several nanometers in size. TEM was employed to obtain fine structure information about the prepared ZnS nanomaterials. The low-magnification TEM images of n-ZnS and s-ZnS (Fig. 3a and b) indicate that both the ZnS samples are composed of a large number of particles with sizes of several nanometers, resulting in wormhole-like mesopores without long-range order. The crystalline nature can be illustrated using high-resolution TEM images (Fig. 3c and d) and fast-Fourier transform patterns (Fig. 3e and f). The lattice fringes of the nanocrystals with interplanar spacing of 3.1 Å in the HRTEM images correspond to the interplanar distance of the (111) plane of the cubic zinc-blende phase. It is also observed that the nanoparticle building blocks of the s-ZnS are smaller and much more uniform than the n-ZnS. As shown in Fig. 3g and h, the particle sizes of s-ZnS and n-ZnS are in the range of 2–5 and 3–10 nm, respectively.

The textural properties of the materials were investigated by N2 adsorption–desorption analysis (Fig. 4). The N2 sorption isotherms of s-ZnS and w-ZnS are of type IV, characteristic of mesoporous materials, according to the IUPAC classification. The isotherms of s-ZnS possess a hysteresis loop of type H1, indicating the uniform mesoporosity, while a hysteresis loop of type H2 with triangular shape and steep desorption branch was observed in the isotherms of w-ZnS.29 The pore size distributions of s-ZnS and w-ZnS, calculated from the NLDFT model, are quite narrow centered at 5.1 and 3.2 nm, respectively. The calculated pore size of w-ZnS is a little smaller than that of s-ZnS, which may be due to the synchronously-precipitated salt performing as an inorganic pore-forming agent to some extent, akin to the roles of organic templates.30,31 However, as for the n-ZnS sample, synthesized without ultrasound treatment, the nitrogen adsorption volume rises steeply in the high relative pressure region of 0.85–1.0, which indicates the existence of larger secondary pores, showing a relatively broad pore size distribution of 3 to 35 nm. This implies that additional sonochemical treatment could make a contribution to the formation of the fine mesoporosity. The detailed textural properties are listed in Table 1. The surface area and pore volume of s-ZnS are 263 m2 g−1 and 0.31 cm3 g, respectively, higher than those of w-ZnS (215 m2 g−1 and 0.17 cm3 g−1). n-ZnS possessed a surface area of only 160 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 0.45 cm3 g−1. It is noteworthy that, when the ultrasonic duration was increased, the specific surface area increased, the pore volume decreased and the pore size distribution narrowed (Fig. S2 and Table S1†). Nevertheless, all the samples prepared in this work possessed higher surface areas than previously reported zinc sulfides.28

3.2 Optical and surface properties
In general, highly crystalline metal sulfide or oxide nanomaterials show weak defect-based fluorescence in the visible spectrum that results from the recombination of photoinduced charges.32–34 On the contrary, nanoparticles with plenty of defects exhibit much stronger visible fluorescence.35,36 Hence, PL spectra were used to qualitatively investigate the surface defect states of the synthesized ZnS samples, shown in Fig. 5. All samples present emission in the visible light region under excitation. The maximum emission bands located at 485 nm for s-ZnS and n-ZnS can be clearly observed, which can be attributed to the recombination of electrons from the energy level of the sulfur vacancies (neutral donor) with the holes from the surface state.33,37 The shoulder peaks with weaker intensities, situated at 432 nm, arose from both Zn2+ and S2− vacancies.38 Noticeably, the w-ZnS sample synthesized in the aqueous system presents analogous but much weaker emission in comparison with that of the ZnS samples prepared in ethanol solutions. s-ZnS gives the strongest emission intensity, indicating the existence of abundant surface defects, in comparison with n-ZnS and w-ZnS. The large number of defects might come from the protecting effect of the inorganic salt shells in the alcohol solutions during the synthesis process. It is considered that the supersaturated inorganic salts could not only precipitate with ZnS simultaneously to obstruct the crystallite growth, but also protect the surface defects owing to the ZnS nanocrystals serving as the NaNO3 crystallite seeds. Furthermore, the emission intensity of s-ZnS is higher than that of n-ZnS, suggesting the assisting effect of ultrasonic treatment in the formation of defect-rich nanoparticles. Indeed, the emission intensity increased gradually with the increase of the sonic irradiation time (Fig. S3†), since the collapse of generated microjets during the ultrasonic treatment could create defects on the surface of the nanoparticles.39,40 The ripening of ZnS nanoparticles in water would happen thereafter to reduce the system energy, which could lead to the reduction of surface defects.

XPS measurements were made because of the surface-sensitive nature. From the high-resolution spectra of Zn 2p (Fig. 6), the spin–orbit splitting of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 is found to be about 23.0 eV, characteristic of ZnS.41 The S 2p spectrum can be fitted by three peaks. The pair around 162.0 eV is associated with the S2− present in ZnS,42 and the third peak at around 168.0 eV is associated with the presence of S6+ due to the equilibrium of the surface charge.43 It can be clearly observed that the S 2p spectrum of s-ZnS exhibits the weakest intensity among the three samples, signifying the insufficiency of the amount of sulfur on the surface, and also revealing the existence of abundant surface S vacancies. In the O 1s high-resolution region, binding energy values at around 531.5 and 532.6 eV are observed in all samples, which are assigned to the chemisorbed oxygen and surface chemically adsorbed hydroxyl groups, respectively.44,45 Since the physically absorbed hydroxyl groups and oxygen molecules on ZnS could be easily eliminated under ultrahigh vacuum during the XPS measurement, the distinct signals of the O 1s spectrum should be due to hydroxyl groups and oxygen strongly bound to the surface defects of the ZnS samples.46 The intensity of the O 1s spectra increased from w-ZnS through to n-ZnS and s-ZnS, which is the opposite trend to that of S 2p, indicating that the synchronously-precipitated NaNO3 could effectively preserve surface defects. The surface component atomic ratios of Zn/S/O measured from the XPS are 1.24:1:2.37, 1.18:1:1.96, and 1.07:1:1.73 for s-ZnS, n-ZnS, and w-ZnS, respectively. The higher Zn/S molar ratio than that of the ideal ZnS composition (1:1) and the existence of a large number of chemisorbed oxygen-containing groups imply more S vacancies than Zn vacancies. The relative contents of surface defects for the three ZnS samples follow the sequence s-ZnS > n-ZnS > w-ZnS, which is in good accordance with the PL analysis. Furthermore, the XPS results demonstrated increased Zn 2p and S 2p binding energies for s-ZnS in comparison to the n-ZnS and w-ZnS samples, while decreased O 1s binding energies were also identified, which is characteristic of defect-rich materials.47,48

TG analysis in air was employed to investigate the thermal stability of the synthesized ZnS samples (Fig. 7). To eliminate the effect of physically adsorbed water molecules, all the ZnS materials were degassed under vacuum at 120 °C for 24 h before the test. It can be observed that the initial weight loss from ambient temperature to near 320 °C can be attributed to the desorption of chemically adsorbed water molecules. It is noticeable that s-ZnS has the most obvious water loss followed by n-ZnS and w-ZnS. This may be due to the mesoporous s-ZnS materials possessing many more surface defects, on which more guest molecules can be chemically bound.45,46 The main weight loss in the 320–750 °C range can be assigned to the transformation of ZnS to the ZnO phase in air. With the increase of the amount of defects from n-ZnS to s-ZnS, the corresponding thermal stability decreases, though it is still difficult to determine the Zn/S ratio according to the weight losses and ZnO residues.

3.3 Formation mechanism
Mesoporous zinc sulfides with high surface area were synthesized in the alcohol system with the assistance of ultrasonic irradiation at room temperature, and a possible formation mechanism is represented in Fig. 8. When Zn(NO3)2 and Na2S ethanol solutions were mixed under stirring, the target ZnS nanoparticles were yielded immediately with synchronously-formed NaNO3 generated from the reaction between Zn(NO3)2 and Na2S. However, the inorganic NaNO3 salt was hardly soluble in ethanol, so the supersaturated sodium nitrite precipitated instantly with the newly-formed ZnS nanoparticles acting as crystallization seeds.49 The NaNO3 shield layer could protect the surface defects by prohibiting mass transfer. During ultrasound irradiation, ultrasonic longitudinal waves were radiated through the solution causing extremely high temperature and pressure in local areas.50 This could result in the physical and chemical effects of ultrasonic irradiation involving fragmentation to small particles.51 The origin of sonochemistry is derived from acoustic cavitation, formation, growth and implosive collapse of gas-filled microbubbles in the liquid medium under ultrasound irradiation. Instantaneous collapse, in less than a microsecond, generated a high temperature of about 5000 K, a high pressure of nearly 1800 atm, and a very high cooling rate in excess of 1010 K, which could lead to the rupture of chemical bonds.52 Afterwards, microjets were formed after the collapse of the acoustic bubble near a solid surface.53 So the zinc and sulfur on the surface of the as-synthesized ZnS nanoparticles were consumed under irradiation of ultrasound within a relatively short time of several minutes due to the rupture of Zn–S chemical bonds.54,55 The consumed zinc and sulfur ions reacted with each other again, while the supersaturated NaNO3 precipitated on the newly-formed ZnS instantly to further restrict the growth of the newly-formed nanoparticles. The particle sizes became smaller with the extension of the sonication time and reached a plateau after 5 min of sonic irradiation. Then, the numerous ZnS@NaNO3 nano-building blocks aggregated to form a mesoporous framework with inorganic salts filling in the mesovoids and acting as inorganic pore-forming agents. The NaNO3 could be easily removed by water extraction while leaving imprints of mesopores on the basis of the large solubility difference of sodium nitrate in water and ethanol. Finally, mesoporous zinc sulfide with a high surface area, much higher than the references elsewhere with surface areas of no more than 160 m2 g−1,28 was successfully synthesized. In the case of fabricating ZnS without the assistance of sonochemistry, n-ZnS consists of comparatively large and non-uniform zinc sulfide nanoparticles. As a result, n-ZnS possessed a lower surface area and wider pore size distribution. Interestingly, ZnS prepared in ethanol has much more abundant defects than the counterparts obtained in water. This may be due to the inevitable ripening of ZnS nanoparticles to reduce the system energy in water. Therefore, the synergistic effect of sonochemistry and the precipitated NaNO3 resulted in mesoporous ZnS with considerable numbers of defects. Above all, if the ultrasound power, liquid medium systems, concentration of inorganic precursor alcohol solution, and other variables are adjusted to suitable values, monodisperse ZnS and even other semiconductor materials with abundant intentionally-made defects could be obtained.

3.4 Photocatalysis
Organic contaminants in the air and water are reputed to be common pollutants. Photocatalysis used in the area of environmental remediation for organic compound degradation has attracted much interest due to the merits of low-cost and environment-friendliness. RhB was selected as a target molecule to evaluate the photoactivities of the synthesized ZnS materials in this contribution. A blank experiment (self-degradation process) was performed in the absence of any catalysts for comparison. As shown in Fig. 9a, one can see that there is almost no concentration variation for the self-degradation under UV-light irradiation without any catalysts and s-ZnS adsorption in the dark.
 Fig. 9  (a) Photoactivities for RhB degradation under UV-light irradiation. (b) Plots of ln(C0/C) versus irradiation time, showing the fitting results using the pseudo-first-order reaction. 
Therefore, the dye self-degradation in this experiment can be neglected and the loss of dye due to catalyst adsorption can also be ignored. 76.7 and 93.1% RhB were decomposed by n-ZnS and s-ZnS after 100 min illumination under ambient conditions, respectively. The surface area and the number of defects increased with the sonic treatment time, as did the photodegradation efficiency (Fig. S5†). The photocatalytic degradation reaction can be assumed to follow a pseudo-first-order expression: ln(C0/C) = kt, where C0/C is the normalized organic compound concentration and k is the apparent reaction rate (min−1). The photoactivity has been defined as the overall degradation rate constant of the catalyst. By plotting ln(C0/C) versus irradiation time through regression, the slopes of the simulated straight lines are the k constants, as depicted in Fig. 9b. The k constant for the s-ZnS sample is 0.0249 min−1, higher than that for n-ZnS (0.0138 min−1). This can be attributed to the higher specific surface area and many more surface defects of s-ZnS. In order to shed light on the vital roles of the defects during the photocatalysis process, the w-ZnS sample prepared in water solution in the presence of ultrasound was applied to the photodegradation of RhB under identical conditions. It is a pity that only 58.9% RhB was degraded after 100 min of irradiation for w-ZnS, and the corresponding apparent reaction rate k is 0.0093 min−1. It is believed that the intentionally-made defects in the prepared ZnS nanomaterials could benefit the efficient separation of photogenerated carriers and minimize the radiative recombination of electrons and holes.56,57 Meanwhile, the surface defects could adsorb the oxygen species dissolved in water (such as O2, O2−, OH−) which could then change to high-activity ·OH− and ·O2− species under illumination, and these active species could effectively take part in the photocatalysis reaction.32,58 In contrast, the w-ZnS sample with fewer defects has weaker photocatalytic activity than the s-ZnS and n-ZnS materials though it has a surface area comparable to that of s-ZnS. Therefore, abundant surface defects in the prepared mesoporous ZnS nanoparticles play vital roles in improving the photocatalytic activities.
4 Conclusions
Mesoporous sphalerite ZnS nanomaterials with high surface area and well-structured mesoporosity were prepared through a sonochemistry-assisted method in an ethanol system, while the synchronously-formed NaNO3 could inhibit the growth of the ZnS nanoparticles and further preserve the surface defects. Ultrasonic waves were essential to obtain a high specific surface area and uniform pore size distribution due to the significant chemical and physical roles of sonochemistry. The synthesized ZnS with valuable optical properties showed outstanding photocatalytic activity for the photodegradation of organic RhB molecules. This simple sonochemistry-assisted salt-extraction methodology is superior to many of the previously reported routes that are time-consuming and need harsh synthesis conditions such as high temperature and pressure. Hence, it can be used to fabricate various porous nanomaterials with defect-related properties, showing practical potential in the fields of environmental remediation and solar cells.
