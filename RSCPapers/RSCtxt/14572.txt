    , Accepted 1st January 2011First published on 16th May 2011AbstractThis chapter reviews the literature reported during 2010 on fullerenes chemistry including fullerene production and properties, organic and organometallic chemistry, endohedral derivatives and advanced materials as well as theoretical studies and possible applications of fullerene and its derivatives.
Highlights
A novel and water-dispersed derivative of the C60-neodymium nanoparticle (nC60(Nd)) has shown great potential for inducing autophagy and sensitising chemotherapeutic killing of both normal and drug-resistant cancer cells compared to nC60. It was demonstrated that autophagy induced by nC60/nC60(Nd) and Rapamycin had a completely different role in cancer chemotherapy.1
1. Production, separation and properties of fullerenes
Preparation and characteristics of C60 nanoparticles including the ones as small as 20 nm by simple hand-grinding of bulk solids with an agate mortar and pestle without the use of any organic solvents have been described. These findings show that the same techniques can be used in developing large-scale production of the C60 nanoparticles.2 A novel approach to rapid fabrication of fullerene C60nanotubes has been developed by exposing C60–pyridine solution to visible light. The results implied that the growth process of fullerene C60nanotubes was controlled by the property of the C60–pyridine adducts and their aggregation.3 A process of fullerene formation from a graphene sheet has been visualised with an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope. Quantum chemical modelling explains four critical steps in the mechanism of fullerene formation.4,5 A novel crystallisation-based process that separates fullerenes C60 and C70 of purity greater than 99 wt% from their commercial mixture using o-xylene as the solvent has been developed.6 One-pot enantioselective extraction of chiral C76 using a novel π-electronic cyclic host bearing a highly π-basic and asymmetrically distorted N-substituted porphyrin where a single extraction produced 7% enantiomeric excess has been reported.7
Suitable hazard and exposure data complemented with recent findings to investigate the extent to which occupational, environmental and consumer risks of fullerenes can be assessed were reviewed.8 The genotoxicity, phototoxicity, and pro-oxidant effects of water-soluble polymer-enwrapped fullerenes (PVP/fullerenes) as antioxidants in cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations were evaluated. It was concluded that these fullerenes are safe for use in cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications.9 A uniform and stable C60-medium dispersion without chemical dispersant was prepared for in vitro evaluation of cellular responses of oxidative stress. The results obtained from this study indicate that C60 has oxidative stress induction potential.10
The solubility of individual light fullerenes and industrial fullerene mixtures in oleic acid, oleinic acid, and linolenoic acid as well as the solubility of fullerenes in the ternary system C60, C70 and o-dichlorobenzene at 423 K were investigated.11 It has been found that C60 is about 30 times more soluble in the coronene nanodroplet solvent than in toluene.12 The solubility and fluorescence properties of pristine fullerene C70 in imidazolium, ammonium and phosphonium based ionic liquids bearing long alkyl chains were reported.13
Systematic theoretical studies have been carried out on the structures, stabilities, aromaticity, and electronic properties of neutral and charged C66.14 Quantum chemical calculations of electronic and geometric structures for all 24 isomers of C84 fullerenes obeying the isolated pentagons rule were performed. The reasons for the instability of isomers not obtained experimentally were determined, and the possibility to produce some of them was established.15
2. Chemistry of the fullerenes
2.1 Organic chemistry

2.1.1 
            Addition reactions
          . 

            C60 derivative bearing terminal alkyne functional groups prepared by the Bingel reaction has been used as a building block under copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition conditions to produce a series of new fullerene glycoconjugate derivatives.16 The virtues of both “click” chemistry and Sauvage's Cu(I) template techniques were applied to the synthesis of the first [2]catenate bearing ZnP and C60 moieties as appended groups in high yields.17 A versatile fullerene hexa-adduct building block incorporating complementary reactive centres with very different and selective reactivity has been prepared and functionalised with three different peripheral groups by successive alkyne-azide and thiol-ene click reactions.18 An elegant synthetic methodology based on the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction was developed for the design of optically active liquid-crystalline fullerodendrimers from enantiomerically pure fulleropyrrolidines.19 A new family of axially chiral buta-1,3-dienes involving conjugation of nonplanar push–pull chromophores to C60 were prepared by a cycloaddition/cycloreversion sequence, their enantiomers were separated and their absolute configuration was determined.20
The facile functionalisation of C60 with cyclopentadienyl and anthracenyl functionalised poly(ethylene glycol) using Diels-Alder cycloadditions at ambient temperature has been reported.21 A new and effective copper-mediated radical reaction that couples a variety of terminal alkynes with a C60Ar5Br in a formal [4+2] annulation reaction to form a dihydronaphthalene ring fused to the fullerene core have been discovered.22 The separation of optically pure fullerodendron formed by the diastereoselective Diels–Alder reaction of C60 with the anthryl dendron having D- or L-gluconamides at the terminals has been described.23 The Diels–Alder reaction has been used to prepare the π-expanded free-base and ZnP–fullerene dyads (H2P-C60 and ZnP-C60) from the reaction of free base and zinc monoanthraporphyrins and C60, respectively.24

Cycloaddition of alkyl(aryl)-substituted diazoalkanes to C60 in the presence of palladium complexes were reported. The effect of diazoalkane structure on the reaction direction and efficient procedures for the synthesis of substituted [5,6] fulleroids has been developed.25 New stable [6,6]-methano cycloadducts and fulleropyrazolines containing electron-withdrawing groups have been obtained by the reaction of ethyl diazopyruvate with C60 under thermal and catalytic conditions.26
Synthesis, characterisation and theoretical studies of the addition of carbene to the C70 equator have been studied.27 A new soluble C70 derivative, indene-C70 bisadduct, was synthesised with high yield by a one-pot reaction of indene and C70 at 180 °C for 72 h. The electrochemical properties and electronic energy levels of the product were measured by cyclic voltammetry.28


2.1.2 
            Alkylation and arylation. 
A new series of soluble C60 derivatives for organic electronic application has been synthesised by ethynylation reaction using different electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups of varying length. It shows that the electronic communication between the C60 and the substituent can take place via the alkyne bridge. DFT calculations of the low occupied molecular orbital energy level of the derivatives showed good correlation with those measured by electrochemistry.291,2-dihydro-C60 fullerenes (1,2-HRC60) have been obtained as the major products from the reactions of dianionic C60 with organic halides, ArCH2Br (Ar = Ph, C6H4CH3, C6H4Br) in DMF, except for the case of o-CH3C6H4CH2Br and which is probably due to the steric effect. The obtained products were characterised by spectroscopic techniques.30


2.1.3 
            Hydrogenation
          . 

Crown-shaped octahydro-C60 fullerene, C60H8 with a non-IPR C60 cage has been synthesised by simple combustion of a gaseous acetylene/benzene mixture. The structure of this novel fulleride has been characterised by MS, UV-Vis, FT-IR, and NMR spectroscopies in combination with DFT calculations.31 A new method of synthesising C60H18 has been reported. The treatment of C60 fullerene in aromatic solvent with aqueous hydrogen iodide yields C60H24·2I2. When this compound was heated under N2 flow it released I2 and HI producing exclusively C60H18 which was characterised with FT-IR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis.32 A commercial mixture of hydrogenated C60 and C70 fullerenes composed of 77% C60Hx and 22% C70Hx has been analysed by HPLC. The electronic absorption spectra of the C60Hx and C70Hx fractions present in mixture confirmed the higher degree of hydrogenation, where x is greater than 36–38 hydrogens. Hydrogenated mixtures prepared by dry hydrogenation shows a remarkable stability in air in contrast to the poor oxidative stability of fullerenes prepared by wet synthesis.33
Gas-phase hydride fullerene anions (C60Hx˙−) were formed by reaction of fullerene anions (C60˙−) with methanol vapour and dehydrogenated with regeneration of the fullerene anions using infrared multiphoton activation in the ion-cyclotron resonance cell of the mass spectrometer. Hydrogenation, dehydrogenation studies taking place in the gas phase can help elucidate mechanisms taking place in other media and pertaining to hydrogen storage or direct methanol fuel cell applications.34


2.1.4 
            Polymerisation
          . 
The mechanism of the addition reaction of PCHD carbanion to C60 was examined using PCHDLi, PCHDLi/DABCO, and PCHDLi/TMEDA. The reactivity of PCHD carbanions was strongly affected by the addition of amine and the increase in the molar ratio of 1,2-CHD units was in the order of PCHDLi > PCHDLi/DABCO > PCHDLi/TMEDA, regardless of the polymer main chain structure.35
Ultrafine C60/PVK composite fibres with 1 μm diameter were fabricated by electrospinning of C60/PVK blend solutions in solvent mixtures of DMF/toluene with a volume ratio of 40/60 when the concentration of PVK was fixed at 5 wt%. The optical characteristics of resulting C60/PVK fibres and thin films were reported. This kind of nanofibres is expected to have potential application for light-emitting diodes and flat panel displays.36
Polycaprolactone/C60(PCL/C60) and PCLNH2/C60OH composite hybrids were prepared via a melt-blending method. These composites were thoroughly characterised by different spectroscopic techniques to compare their performance.37 The synthesis of C60-OPV dendrimers of first and second generations and their characterisation by absorption and emission spectroscopy has been reported.38

            Fullerene polymethyl methacrylate (C60-PMMA) conjugates were synthesised through 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile-initiated in situpolymerization of methyl methacrylate under a series of reaction conditions in supercritical carbon dioxide. Selected C60-PMMA conjugates were characterised through different spectroscopic analysis. The C60-PMMA conjugates have shown improved thermal stability at higher temperature with respect to PMMA.39
The first successful encapsulation of pristine C70 in polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-C70) of controlled diameter through miniemulsion polymerisation techniques was described. Oxygen-impermeable films were prepared by dispersing PS-C70 nanoparticles in polyacrylonitrile, these material was used as fluorescence temperature sensors.40


2.1.5 
            Fullerene derivatives containing halogens. 
Milligram quantities of C60F20 were prepared using LiMnF4 as fluorinating gent. XRD, 19F NMR and FT-IR spectra were used in conjunction with DFT calculations to propose the D5d “saturnene” structure of C60F20.41 A preparation, stability and spectroscopic characterisation of symmetrical and unsymmetrically substituted C60F15R2R′ water-soluble emerald-green trannulenes, possessing carboxylic or ammonium ion groups has been achieved for the first time.42 A remarkable isomerisation of trannulene fullerene derivatives C60F15[CX(COOR)2]3 (X = Br, COOR; R = Alkyl) to the corresponding triumphenes through an unprecedented migration of three organic addends from one hemisphere of the fullerene cage to the other has been described.43
Perfluoroalkylation of C60 and C70 with the use of the linear-chain RfI (Rf = CF3, C2F5, n-C3F7, n-C4F9, and n-C6F13) has been performed in high-temperature reactions, and the products characterised by spectroscopic, electrochemical and structural techniques.44 The charged states of C60(CF3)2n (2n = 2–10) derivatives have been studied by in situ electron spin resonance and Vis–NIR spectroelectrochemistry. The anion radicals and diamagnetic dianions were described by DFT calculations.45
The synthesis, isolation and structural characterisation of several compounds of cycloperfluoroalkylated C70 in the systems C70–1,2-C2F4I2 and C70–1,4-C4F8I2 were reported and their molecular structures were determined by XRD.46 The trifluoromethylation of a higher fullerene mixture using trifluoromethyliodide, followed by the HPLC separation of CF3 derivatives resulted in the isolation of C76(CF3)14, C76(CF3)16, C76(CF3)18,47C82(CF3)12 and C82(CF3)1848 derivatives. The crystal and molecular structures of CF3 derivatives have been determined by XRD using synchrotron radiation.
A dynamic HPLC study combined with MS revealed that C70 chlorination with ICl is a regioselective reaction yielding single-isomers of soluble C70Cl6, C70Cl8, and C70Cl10. The first stability study of C70Cl6,8,10 in solution showed that these compounds are very light-sensitive.49
For the first time the most stable non-IPR C72 cage has been synthesised as the chlorinated derivative C72Cl4, which was prepared using CCl4 as a chlorinating agent, separated, and characterised by XRD analysis. The chlorination pattern and resulting stability of C72Cl4 has been discussed.50,51
A highly chlorinated fullerene C76Cl34 has been synthesised by chlorination of the chiral fullereneD2-symmetric C76 with iodine monochloride. The structure of C76Cl34 was determined by XRD.52
A new C1-symmetric non-IPR hollow isomer, C78, has been captured as C78Cl4 and then subjected to a regioselective substitution reaction with benzyl hydroperoxide to form C78(OOCH2C6H5)Cl7. The structural connectivity of C78, which contains a pair of fused pentagons, was confirmed by XRD analysis.53
An unexpected heptagon-containing C84fullerene cage was found in C84Cl32 which was formed, in addition to C86Cl28, by chlorination of C86 with VCl4. Chlorination of C86 to C84Cl32, a derivative with a shrunken carbon cage containing a heptagon was confirmed by XRD analysis.54
Four novel fullerene derivatives, C54Cl8, C56Cl12, C66Cl6 and C66Cl10 have been obtained by chlorination of the corresponding non-IPR fullerenes. They are the first experimentally established fullerene derivatives featuring TSFP. The discovery of TSFP fullerenes portends what promises to be an exciting new direction in fullerene chemistry.55


2.1.6 
            Fullerene derivatives containing nitrogen. 
Two classes of unsymmetrical C60-fulleropyrrolidine bis-adducts containing orthogonally protected terminal amino- and carboxy-groups have been prepared as models for fullerene-based peptidomimetics with the carbon sphere inserted into the peptide backbone.56 The synthesis, characterisation and behaviour of a series of rotaxanes containing a fulleropyrrolidine stopper and two ferrocene electron-donors on the macrocycle were reported. The synthetic routes presented an efficient way to prepare a variety of rotaxanes and molecular shuttles with potential applications in different fields.57 Four diastereoisomeric pure C60-fulleropyrrolidines were synthesised and characterised. The absolute configurations of the stereogenic centres were determined by spectroscopic analysis. The liquid-crystalline properties of the C60-fullerodendrimers were studied by polarised optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry.58
A series of N-pyrrolidine C60 fullerene/epoxy nanocomposites has been prepared using the Prato reaction, and their respective ultimate tensile strengths determined.59
Two new fullerene amino acids have been prepared by dipolar addition to C60 of azido amino acids derived from phenylalanine and lysine and characterised by UV-Vis and cyclic voltammetry analysis.60 The first C60 fullerenyl azide was prepared through Lewis acid-promoted addition of trimethylsilyl azide to a cage-opened fullerene derivative.61
A series of 4-aziridino-C60-fullerene-1,8-naphthalimide ([6,6]-closed ring) were synthesised through the aziridination reaction of C60 with the corresponding azide under microwave irradiation in high yield. Consequently, this dyad was regarded as a potential fluorescent switch.62
Two novel pyrazolino-C60 fullerenes have been prepared by cycloaddition reaction of nitrile imines generated in situ from hydrazones to C60. All the compounds were characterised by spectroscopic and elemental analysis.63 The synthesis of fulleroisoxazolines or fulleropyrazolines by a one-step reaction of C60 with aldoximes or hydrazones mediated by (diacetoxyiodo)benzene was acheived.64
A novel thermal rearrangement of push–pull-chromophore–C60 conjugates N,N-dimethylanilino-substituted 1,1,4,4-buta-1,3-dienes yields new C1-symmetric 1,2,9,12-tetrakis-C60 adducts, which were elucidated by XRD.65
A dibenzo[a,c]phenazine C60 dyad in which two chromophores are linked in close proximity to each other has been synthesised by the Prato reaction between 11-formyldibenzo[a,c]phenazine and C60 and studied in detail by optical spectroscopy.66

An efficient method for the preparation of novel fullerenyl 1,4-and 1,16-bisadducts C60[CMe(CO2Et)2]2via the trapping of C602− intermediates with highly reactive sterically hindered diethyl 2-bromo-2-methylmalonate esters in yields of 35% and 7% respectively have been demonstrated.73 Disubstituted C60-fused lactone was selectively synthesised by the reaction of C60 with a substituted malonate ester promoted by ferric perchlorate Fe(ClO4)3 in the presence of acetic anhydride.74
The synthesis of the rare C60-fused 1,3-dioxolanes has been achieved by the reaction of C60 with aldehydes or ketones in the presence of ferric perchlorate. A plausible reaction mechanism for the product was suggested.75C60 hexakis-adducts bearing 12 peripheral carbohydrate76 or iminosugar77 moieties have been prepared for the first time by grafting sugar derivatives onto the C60 core through the copper mediated Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azides and alkynes.
The cyclopentadienyl type hexa-adduct C60(OOOtBu)6 was readily converted into the 2H-pyran- containing fullerene derivative C60(O)(OOH)(OOtBu)5 in the presence of NaHCO3 and hydroquinone. C60 derivatives containing a 3,6-dihydro-2H-pyran moiety have also been prepared by addition of hydroxylamine to the 2H-pyran moiety.78
The simplest and hitherto elusive C60/crown ether and thioethers conjugates have been prepared through an effective free-radical approach. A mechanistic explanation for this new reactivity of C60 was also provided.79
The self-sensitised photooxygenation of a C60–cycloheptatriene dyad which afforded a mixture of stable endo- and exo-endoperoxides derived from the corresponding norcaradiene isomers was investigated.80 The formation of two 10-membered orifices on C60 cage through repeated acid catalyzed epoxide opening and oxidation of the resulting diol with diacetoxyiodobenzene has been achieved.81

2.2 Organometallic chemistry
The electrochemical properties of exohedral complexes of transition metals with metallofragments coordinated to C60 and C70 fullerene ligands in different coordination modes were reviewed.82 A series of novel double-decker lanthanide(III) bis(phthalocyaninato)–C60 dyads bearing different lanthanide ions have been prepared and their electrochemical and photophysical properties were described.83

Synthesis, characterisation, and photochemical properties of supramolecular C60imidazole tetrad SubPc–TPA–ZnP˙+:C60Im˙− were established. The presence of C60 is expected to stabilise the charge-separated state.95 The chemical synthesis of two C60–porphyrin complexes C60–H2P and an iodide salt of ZnP (C60–ZnP)+I− have been described together with their spectroscopic properties.96 The electron transfer along π-conjugated spacers in a novel series of supramolecular assembled porphyrin/C60 hybrids has been studied.97 A novel phase-separated bicontinuous system composed of low-molecular donor and acceptor that is built up through coordination-based orientation of pyridylated C60 on a pi-conjugated ZnP J-type assembly has been fabricated. This complex system achieved unusually high efficiency of switchable fluorescence quenching.98 A series of water-soluble, tightly coupled porphyrin/C60 electron-donor–acceptor conjugates through tether-controlled synthesis and facile covalent introduction of Newkome-type dendrimers were developed.99 The aggregation and photophysical properties of supramolecular self-assembling depsipeptide dendrimers and dendritic fullerenes with new cis- and trans-configured Hamilton receptor functionalised ZnP have been investigated.100

A full account of the synthesis, characterisation, and studies of the ground- and excited-state electronic interactions occurring in the C60–SubPc–Fc systems, as well as in their respective C60–SubPc and SubPc–Fc reference compounds, was presented.102 A novel molecular triad comprised of a redox-active anion-receptor oxoporphyrinogen and C60 entities was synthesised. The effect of binding of F− to oxoporphyrinogen on the photoinduced electron-transfer processes via both the singlet and triplet excited states was studied.103
Ultrathin films have been fabricated from anionic or cationic water-soluble C60 derivatives by layer-by-layer deposition technique. The deposition mechanism and the conductive properties of those films assembly have been discussed.104

The film morphology and device stability were discussed.110 A power conversion efficiency of more than 6.2% was achieved for PSC based on P3HT as donor and ICBA as acceptor.111,112 It has been found that the key to the high efficiency of annealed P3HT:PCBM solar cells lies in their ability to directly generate free charges upon exciton quenching.113
A novel PCBM-based n-type material, PCBSD, functionalised with a dendron containing two styryl groups as the thermal cross-linkers has been rationally designed and easily synthesised.114 Treatment of C60 with potassium methylnaphthalenide and excess C6F5CH2Br afforded 1,4-bis(pentafluorobenzyl)C60 by face-to-face interaction and which allows the molecule to be utilized for high-performance organic photovoltaic devices.115 Organic solar cells based on CuPc and C60 or C70 as acceptors were fabricated. The results showed the photovoltaic performances of the cells using C70-acceptor to be better than that of C60-acceptor.116

A series of 13C-enriched monoytterbium endohedral metallofullerenes Yb@C2n(n = 40, 41, 42) were synthesised and isolated. Their cage structures were systematically determined for the first time using computational and experimental 13C NMR studies.133
4. Applications of fullerene derivatives
The prospects of using C60 fullerene derivatives as medicinal drugs and photoactive materials in light converting devices have been reviewed.134 The chemistry, properties and non-biological applications of fullerenes and their evolution to biological applications have been presented.135 The outstanding properties and potential applications of the synthetic carbon allotropes, fullerenes, nanotubes and graphene have been summarised.136 The current understanding of fullerene-based nanomaterials in potential clinical applications as well as biological mechanism of fullerenes and its derivatives in disease therapy were discussed.137,138 The synthesis, physico-chemical properties, and biomedical effects of Gd@C82(OH)22 have been reviewed.139
A new polyhydroxylated fullerene molecule C60(OH)24 was synthesised and its protective effects in mice subjected to irradiation have been studied. The study showed that C60(OH)24 is promising radioprotective agents.140
A new application of fullerene in biomedicine involving its use as a carrier of in vivoradionuclide decorporation agents was supported by the results obtained using 99mTc(CO)3–C60(OH)20 as a model on the in vivo biological behaviour of fullerene derivative in normal Kunming mice.141
Pulmonary histopathological studies of [Gd@C82(OH)22]n and [C60(OH)24]n nanoparticles for mice with or without tumor inoculation showed that these two different types of water-soluble fullerenes can prevent lungs from inflammatory lesion and tumor invasion.142 It has been found that Gd@C82(OH)22 serve as a potent antiangiogenesis inhibitor that can simultaneously target multiple angiogenic factors.143 It was demonstrated that [Gd@C82(OH)22]n nanoparticles can induce dendritic cells to become functionally mature as illustrated by their capacity to activate allogeneic T cells and activate Th1 immune responses. These new findings also provide a rational understanding of the potent anticancer activities of [Gd@C82(OH)22]n nanoparticles.144 Gd@C82 endometallofullerene/empty fullerene hydroxylated mixtures were prepared and studied as MRI-contrasting agents. The hydroxylation was performed by H2O2 oxidation at elevated temperature. NMR tomography in vivo revealed the contrasting action of hydroxylated gadofullerene mixtures to be 15-30 times that of commercial “Gadovist” contrasting agent.145

Water-soluble carboxyfullerenes (C60[C(CO2H)2]6) and (C60[C(CO2H)2]3) have been synthesised and their novel biomedical applications were described. The first study to show that carboxylated fullerenes can induce cell cycle arrest and premature senescence in human skin cells were reported.146 The synthesis and potential of the hydrosoluble of poly(vinyl alcohol)/C60 and PVP)/C60 nanohybrids as potential photodynamic cancer therapy agents was approached.147 It was demonstrated that a water-soluble C60-TPFE can deliver genes as efficiently as a cationic liposome-based system in vivo. TPFE can produce a stable complex with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and show no acute organ toxicity. Moreover, insulin gene delivery by TPFE could reduce blood glucose levels.148

Water-soluble C60 derivatives; C60-(γ-CyD)2, C60-(bisγ-CyD)5 containing mono C60-(γ-CyD)5, and C60-PVP were synthesised to examine their bioactivities. The results show that water-soluble C60 derivatives are able to enhance neurite outgrowth in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells that were used as a model of nerve cells.149 A novel water soluble folacin C60 derivative was synthesised and characterised using spectroscopic and elemental analysis. Experiments on rat PC12 using this fullerene derivative showed that it has the potential to prevent oxidative stress-induced cell death without evident toxicity.150
The influence of hydrated C60 fullerene on the kinetics of clot lysis induced by tissue plasminogen activator has been explored in vitro. Applications of hydrated fullerenes can be found in both thrombolytic enzymes and in the design of novel anticoagulants.151 A series of derivatised C60 fullerenes possessing alcohol, amine, and amino acid pendant groups were found to act as inhibitors of the zinc enzymes carbonic anhydrases. These derivatives showed applications for targeting physiologically relevant isoforms, such as the dominant CAII and the tumor-associated CAIX which represent established drug targets.152
The distribution of 14C60 in the pregnant rat and fetuses, and in the lactating rat was studied. The study showed that 14C60 crosses the placenta and is transmitted to offspring via the dam's milk and subsequently systemically absorbed.153
A polymeric semiconductor comprising a micrometer-sized assemble of alkylated C60 derivatives and carbon nanotubes was constructed as a temperature indicator. This is the first report utilizing C60-SWCNT assembly as the indicator for photothermal conversion of SWCNT.154 A new soluble C60 derivative, ICBA, was easily synthesised from C60 and indene as an alternative acceptor material to PCBM. The PSC based on P3HT with ICBA as acceptor shows higher power conversion efficiency.155
The synthesis, chemical structure and electrochemical performances of polymeric fullerene-coated silicon thin films as anode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries have been studied and compared with those of the bare Si thin film case.156
A novel C60methanofullerene containing pyridine pendants has been synthesised and used to fabricate a silver selective electrode. The fabricated electrodes were used for bioanalysis of glucose with silver nanoparticle as the potential redox marker. It can be used in a wide pH range (pH 4–7.5) with a response time less than 10 seconds.157 Siver-intercalated C60 (Ag7C60) by means of Ag–C60 co-deposition on a substrate maintained at 23 K suppressing the aggregation of cohesive Ag atoms has been fabricated. Ag-doped C60 can serve as a new platform for hydrogen-storage materials and novel superconductors.158
A C60/expanded graphite composite was prepared by chemical and thermal treatments, characterised by XRD, FT-IR spectroscopy and its lubricating properties in commercial grease were investigated. The prepared composite was found useful as an antiware additive for lubricant.159
A novel fullerene drug delivery approach via liposomes enriched with amphiphilic C70 bisadducts that were designed to structurally mimic cellular membrane lipids has been described.160
