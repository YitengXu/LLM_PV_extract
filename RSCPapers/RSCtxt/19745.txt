1 Introduction
The global energy crisis and environmental pollution have been increasingly prominent with the accelerated industrialization and rapid growth of the world's population. To alleviate the energy crisis and environmental pressure, researchers are striving to find new energy substitutes constantly and improve energy conversion efficiency.1–4 Energy storage technology is considered to be an effective way to solve energy supply and achieve sustainable development, which can solve the contradiction between energy supply and demand in time and space. Thermal energy storage (TES) plays an important role in all kinds of energy storage technologies, which can collect, store and release heat energy according to the requirements of social development.5–9 TES technologies mainly include sensible heat energy storage, latent heat energy storage, and chemical heat energy storage. Latent heat energy storage system has high energy storage density and maintains a constant temperature in the process of heat storage, so it has attracted extensive attention.10–12
Phase change materials (PCMs) are energy storage materials that can absorb and release significant amounts of energy in the form of latent heat during phase change process.13,14 From a historical perspective, the current development of PCMs and their advantages and challenges are systematic. The first generation of PCMs represented by molten salt were reported in the 1910s, which had the advantages of low cost and high latent heat, but faced the challenge of high corrosion in practical application. Since the 1950s, second-generation organic PCMs such as paraffin, sugar alcohols, and fatty acids, had been explored for moderate temperature applications. The advantages of they were good environmental stability, moderate storage capacity and good biocompatibility, while the disadvantages are low thermal conductivity and poor flammability. Since the 1990s, to obtain PCMs with better performance, the third-generation PCMs included ultra-high thermal metals with significant electrical conductivity and optical properties, etc. Properties of PCMs are critical factors affecting TES, and there are many kinds of PCMs. According to the state of PCMs, PCMs are generally divided into solid–solid phase change, solid–liquid phase change, solid–gas phase change, and liquid–gas phase change.15,16 Although solid–gas and liquid–gas phase change show high latent heat in the process of phase change, they produce a large amount of gas with the large volume change that limits their practical application.17 Solid–solid PCMs use the transformation between different crystal forms to realize energy storage and release.18 During the solid–solid phase transformation process, there are apparent advantages during the phase change process, such as without solution and gas for leakage, small volume change, and no packaging.19–23 Compared with solid–solid PCMs, solid–liquid PCMs have high energy storage density, diverse types, and wide applications. Solid–liquid PCMs can be roughly divided into inorganic solid–liquid PCMs and organic solid–liquid PCMs. Inorganic solid–liquid PCMs mainly contain salt hydrate, eutectic mixture, and metal alloy. Despite the advantages of low-cost, high energy storage density, and high thermal conductivity, inorganic solid–liquid PCMs also have the fatal disadvantages of phase separation and high supercooling. Alternatively, there are many kinds of organic solid–liquid materials, including paraffin24 or polyethylene glycol (PEG),25,26 fatty acids (FA),27,28etc. organic solid–liquid PCMs have great potential for application in sustainable energy such as thermal management and energy-efficient building systems due to strong energy storage capacity, high energy storage density, which are expected to play an essential role in the future energy development and utilization. However, common organic PCMs have some issues in practice, such as structure instability, low thermal conductivity, and poor mechanical properties.29 Extensive investigations have been conducted to deal with the tough issues. Particularly, positive progress on microencapsulation of PCMs (MEPCMs) and form-stable PCMs (FSPCMs) immensely promote shape stability.30–32 Among them, organic, inorganic and organic–inorganic materials can be used as shell to encapsulate PCMs core for shape stability of MEPCMs.33–36 And PCMs are dispersed in porous scaffolds, polymer scaffolds and silicon scaffolds meanwhile the scaffolds enable the shape stability for forming FSPCMs.37–39 Several studies have viewed that PCMs capable of maximum PCMs content and high thermal storage density have been successfully prepared for MEPCMs and FSPCMs. Besides, much work on incorporating nanoparticles into PCMs was proposed to improve thermal conductivity and mechanical properties.40–42 Here, this review compliments an overall of the latest research progress of PCMs and highlights the various green and low-cost strategies for PCMs preparation as well as its invented or potential applications in thermal management, solar energy, smart fabrics, and building energy-saving systems.43–47 In this review, research progress on improved integrated performance and other aspects in MEPCMs and FSPCMs is introduced. In addition, diverse applications on PCMs, such as thermal management devices, smart textiles and intelligent buildings, are also discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects of PCMs are summarized. Actually, we devote to provide a guidance on developing green and sustainable routes to prepare PCMs for developing their large-scale utilization in diverse fields.
2 Microencapsulation of PCMs
The shell materials play a key role in determining the sealing effectiveness and thermal energy-storage/release performance of MEPCMs. This is since they not only can provide a barrier for protecting PCMs core but also can supply a huge heat transfer area for encapsulated PCM with its larger specific surface areas.48–51 The diverse range of materials, including organic polymers, inorganic materials, and organic–inorganic composite materials, have been employed as shell materials for MEPCMs to form the microcapsules with a well-defined core–shell structure.52–55
2.1 MEPCMs with organic shell
Organic polymers are considered as a type of most commonly used shell materials for the synthesis of MEPCMs. These organic shell materials are mainly, poly(melamine-formaldehyde) (PMF) resin,56 poly(urea-formaldehyde) (PUF),57,58 polyurea (PUA),59 polyurethane (PU),60–62 poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA),63,64 polystyrene (PS),65,66 polyaniline (PANi)67 and many more.68–72 It can be inferred that the type of polymeric shell plays a key role in determining the thermal properties of MEPCMs, whereas the characteristics of polymeric shells such as crosslinking degree, shell thickness, tightness, and mechanical strength influence the thermal energy-storage performance, thermal stability, phase transition recoverability, and thermal reliability and durability of the corresponding MEPCMs.73–76

2.1.1 PMF shell. 
As a cost-effective and facilely available polymeric material, PMF has broadly been used for microencapsulation of PCMs due to its unique inherent properties including good sealing tightness, water resistance, sealing endurance, and fire resistance. In general, the synthesis of MEPCMs with a PMF shell involves an in situ polymerization process.77,78 Cao et al.79 synthesized the microencapsulated octadecane with PMF shell. The supercooling of octadecane microcapsules was inhibited by optimizing the composition and structure of the PMF shell. And the effects of these synthesis parameters on the phase transition properties of the octadecane microcapsules have been investigated systemically. Aiming at the characteristics of PMF with poor toughness and high brittleness owing to its unique structure of triazine ring. Geng et al.80 microencapsulated n-dodecanol with long-chain alkanol etherified PMF shell. And the relevant influencing factors in the etherification process on performance of microcapsules were explored.


2.1.2 PMF shell. 
PMMA has also been widely used as a shell material for the synthesis of MEPCMs because of its excellent mechanical strength and exceptional sunlight stability. Sarı et al.81 selected PMMA as shell material to synthesize the microencapsulated n-alkanes and paraffin eutectic mixtures through emulsion polymerization. These microcapsules not only showed excellent latent heat-storage capacities but also exhibited good chemical stability and thermal durability. And Al-Shannaq et al.82 investigated the microencapsulation of paraffin with PMMA as a shell by suspension polymerization. The increase in the emulsion stability by using mixed surfactants and the effect of adding pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETRA) as cross-linking agent on the PCM microcapsules characteristics was investigated. Adding the cross-linking agent to the system could improve the surface morphology and produce microcapsules with a much higher PCM content.


2.1.3 PS shell. 
Similar to PMMA, PS is also a facilely availably polymer widely employed as shell materials for MEPCMs.83,84 Sarı et al.85 reported the synthesis and performance investigation of MEPCMs with n-heptadecane as a core and PS as a shell via emulsion polymerization method. Konuklu et al.86 also used PS to encapsulate caprylic acid as a PCM through an emulsion polymerization route and found that the PS shell could effectively depress the volatility of caprylic acid core. The influence of the type and concentration of the cross-linking agent on the phase-change properties of the microcapsules was examined.


2.1.4 PUA shell. 
PUA resin is another type of commonly used shell materials for MEPCMs, because they can offer a more flexible and tough shell for the PCM core. PUA shell could be fabricated onto the PCM core by the reaction of isocyanate with various polyamines through an interfacial polymerization route. Zhang et al.59 synthesized the microencapsulated n-octadecane with polyurea shells containing different soft segments using TDI as an oil-soluble monomer and various amines as a water-soluble monomer. Zhan et al.87 prepared microencapsulated paraffin with polyurea shell by interfacial polycondensation method using isophorone diisocyanate as a raw material to replace TDI as shell monomers. And the phase latent heat of the resultant microcapsules is 92.5 J g−1 with a core loading of 44.5 wt%. Sun et al.88 designed and prepared reversible photochromic PUA microcapsules with butyl stearate containing photochromic dye (spirooxazine) as the core material. The microcapsules presented quick photo-response and excellent color identification under sun light, which were endowed with an outdoor-clothing with display function under sunlight.


2.1.5 Other organic shell. 
Paloma et al.89 proposed a copolymerization modification for microencapsulated paraffin or palmitic acid by fabrication of a poly(St-co-EA) shell through emulsion copolymerization, and there was a significant improvement in plastic deformation observed for the as-synthesized microcapsules due to the incorporation of an EA soft segment. Wan et al.90 designed a novel type of MEPCMs with a pliable self-recovering shell by encapsulating paraffin into a poly (ST-co-AA-co-BA) shell, and they successfully fabricated the microcapsules through in situ polymerization combined with a hydrothermal process (Table 1).

2.2 MEPCMs with organic–inorganic composite shells
There are some limitations for MEPCMs with polymeric shell materials due to the natures of low thermal conductivity, poor thermal and chemical stability. Generally, inorganic compounds have much better chemical, mechanical and thermal stabilities than the organic ones. Therefore, the use of composite shell materials composed of organic polymers and inorganic compounds can improve the properties of microcapsules. There are many methods that have been explored for the introduction of inorganic materials into polymeric shells, including the dispersion of inorganic nanoparticles, utilization of modified inorganic nanoparticles as Pickering stabilizers, synthesis of organic–inorganic double-layered shells and so on.91–94 The selection of organic/inorganic combination is the critical factor affecting the thermal properties and latent heat-storage capability of microcapsules.95,96

2.2.1 Metal oxide nanoparticles. 
These metal oxide nanoparticles were commonly used as an inorganic filler for polymer matrix shell due to their non-toxic, high thermal conductivity and structurally stable properties such as SiO2, TiO2, Fe2O3, ZnO and many more.97–100 Wang et al.101 fabricated the microencapsulated n-octadecane with the PMMA/SiO2 hybrid shell via a photocurable Pickering emulsion polymerization method. This new methodology provided a facile and low-energy synthetic strategy for the construction of microcapsules with a wide variety of organic–inorganic hybrid shells. Li et al.102 developed a facile emulsion method to encapsulate n-octadecane with a PMMA/TiO2 shell by using UV-radiation to initiate polymerization, and the resultant microcapsules exhibited a high latent heat-storage capacity, reduced supercooling degree, and enhanced thermal stability and thermal conduction. The encapsulation efficiency of the microcapsules reached 67.2% when the appropriate proportion of MMA/n-octadecane was 1:1, and the melting enthalpy was 179.9 J g−1.


2.2.2 Thermally conductive inorganic powders. 
As the sort of high thermally conductive inorganic powders, Si3N4, SiC and TiC were also widely used for thermal conductive enhancement of polymers.103,104 Wang et al.105 reported the application of Si3N4 for enhancement in thermal performance of microencapsulated n-octadecane with a MUF shell and confirmed that the incorporation of Si3N4 nanoparticles into the MUF shell could effectively improve the thermal conductivity, thermal reliability and latent heat-storage capability. As shown in Fig. 1(a), a similar work was reported by Wang and co-workers, SiC powders were introduced into MUF resin hybrid shell by in situ polymerization. When the content of nano-SiC arrived 6 wt%, the thermal conductivity increased by 59.2%. The photothermal conversion curve was shown in Fig. 1(b), MicroPCMs-6% and MicroPCMs-8% showed excellent photothermal conversion property, and the photothermal conversion rate were 74.4% and 71.1%, respectively.106 Wang et al.107 choose surface-modified SiO2 and TiC nanoparticles as Pickering stabilizers and thermal conductivity additives and carried out the synthesis of PMMA-SiO2/TiC hybrid shell to microencapsulate n-octadecane. Moreover, the effects of nano-TiC particles on morphologies and thermal property of microcapsules with a polymer-SiO2/TiC hybrid shell were discussed.

2.2.3 Nano-structural carbon-based materials. 
Nano-structural carbon-based materials have an extremely high thermal conductivity, good mechanical stability as well as a relatively low density. The incorporation of carbon-based materials into polymeric shell of MEPCMs could improve their thermal conductivity and photo-thermal conversion property evidently.108 Therefore, there were an increasing number of studies focusing on the preparation and performance characterization of MEPCMs integrated with carbon-based materials in recent years. Liu et al.109 conducted an experimental investigation on the preparation and thermal performance of microencapsulated paraffin with the PMF shell embedded with graphite nanoparticles through an emulsion-templated in situ polycondensation. The as-prepared microcapsules could be dispersed in ionic liquid to form a novel latent functional thermal fluid with remarkable photo-thermal conversion property. Huang et al.110 developed a facile layer-by-layer self-assembly technique to encapsulate n-octadecane into the PMF shell containing highly interconnected CNTs. The introduction of CNTs not only improved the thermal stability, thermal transfer rate and mechanical properties of the resultant microcapsules but also reduced their supercooling degree.
As a major derivative of graphene, GO has several oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which makes GO act as a Pickering stabilizer to facilitate the formation of polymer/GO shell for the MEPCMs.111–113 Chen et al.114 also used GO to modify the PMF shell of microencapsulated n-dodecanol by in situ polymerization and found that the thermal conductivity of the microcapsules increased by about 66% when 4 wt% of GO was incorporated into the PMF shell. Particularly, our team prepared microencapsulated paraffin with PMF/GO hybrid shell by Pickering technology, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The combination of PMF and GO hybrid shell not only enhanced thermal conductivity but also significantly improved leakage-prevention of MEPCMs from Fig. 2(b) and (c).115

2.2.4 Organic–inorganic hybrid shells. 
Furthermore, organic–inorganic hybrid shells with excellent anti-leakage performance have been also promising for encapsulation of PCMs to achieve exceptional capsule properties.116–118 Zhu et al.119 fabricated novel polymer-SiO2 hybrid shelled nanoencapsulated n-octadecane in one-pot, through sequentially executed interfacial hydrolysis-polycondensation of alkoxy silanes and radical polymerization of vinyl monomers. The polymer-SiO2 hybrid shell materials endowed the nanocapsules with improved thermal reliability, thermal conductivity, leakage proof property and mechanical properties. Furthermore, we presented a novel approach to the microencapsulated n-octadecane with TiO2-PUA shell via a two-step liquid phase deposition at low temperature,120 As shown in Fig. 3(a), Pornea et al.121 designed and synthesized a novel hierarchical SiO2/TiO2/PDA composite shell through inter-layer arrangement on an encapsulated n-eicosane. The microcapsules with organic–inorganic hybrid shells had excellent structural stability, activity. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d), the combination of SiO2, TiO2, and PDA layered shell has promoted localized surface photothermal effect due to light scattering effect and visible light absorption durability, and solar photocatalytic (Table 2).

2.3 MEPCMs with inorganic shells
The organic–inorganic composite shells have a great superiority in thermal conduction compared to the polymeric ones. However, the discordant proportion of the inorganic components make the conductive additives tend to detach from the surface of microcapsules during the repeated phase transition process. And it also damages the mechanical strength and compactness of the hybrid shell. Therefore, use of inorganic materials as the shell to encapsulate PCMs could significantly enhance the thermal conductivity, mechanical durability, and chemical and thermal stability of the microcapsules.122–124

Zhang et al.125 successfully fabricated the microcapsules containing an n-octadecane core and SiO2 shell through in situ polycondensation in an O/W emulation-templating system using PEO-PPO-PEO as a nonionic templating agent, and they observed a significant improvement in thermal conductivity for the resultant microcapsules. To avoid its agglomeration, the surfaces of SiO2 usually need to be modified by γ-aminopropyl triethoxysilane. Guo et al.126 prepared microencapsulated paraffin with the SiO2 shell with amino-terminated by the polycondensation sol–gel method.


2.3.2 CaCO3 shell. 
Loading inorganic nanoparticles on silica shell can further improve the photo-thermal conversion property and thermal conductivity of microcapsules.127,128 Zhang et al.129 embedded the Ti4O7 nanoparticles into the SiO2 shell successfully. Compared with paraffin, the thermal conductivities of the novel paraffin@SiO2/Ti4O7 microcapsules were greatly enhanced from 0.304 W m−1 K−1 to 1.322 W m−1 K−1 due to the high thermal conductivities of the novel paraffin@SiO2/Ti4O7 microcapsules were greatly enhanced from 0.304 W m−1 K−1 to 1.322 W m−1 K−1 due to the high thermal conductivity of the SiO2 shells modified by Ti4O7 nanoparticles. Moreover, the solar absorption capacity was calculated up to 88.28%, and the photo-thermal storage efficiency of the paraffin@SiO2/Ti4O7 microcapsules was up to 85.36% compared with 24.14% for pure paraffin. Similarly, Zhu et al.130 prepared nanoencapsulated n-octadecane with SiO2/graphene composite shell. In comparison to the nanocapsules with SiO2 shell, the thermal conductivity was increased by 132.9% and the supercooling was eliminated completely, while leaving the latent heats almost intact.
CaCO3 is considered as one of the best shell materials for MEPCMs, because it has a more rigid and tight nature than other inorganic materials.131–133 Compared with SiO2 shell, the CaCO3 shell can endow the PCM core with much stronger mechanical protection and tighter sealing effect, thus extending a longer working lifespan for the microcapsules.
An interfacial self-assembly precipitation method for microencapsulation of n-octadecane with CaCO3 shell was first reported by Yu and co-workers in 2014.134 They established an O/W emulsion-templating system using nonionic surfactants to assemble calcium ions by complexation, followed by carbonate precipitation at the interface of micelles. The resulting CaCO3 shell presented a crystalline phase of vaterite with high rigidity and tightness and thus provided high reliability, long durability, and good anti-osmosis performance for the as-synthesized microcapsules. Jiang et al.135 also reported a self-assembly synthesis for microencapsulated paraffin with a GO-modified CaCO3 shell using SMA copolymer as a templating agent, and they found that the combination of CaCO3 and GO could remarkably enhance the thermal stability, thermal conductivity, leakage resistance and mechanical properties of microencapsulated PCM. As shown in Fig. 4(a), Liu et al.136 designed and fabricated the microencapsulated n-docosane with CaCO3/Fe3O4 composite shell by the nonaqueous emulsion-templated self-assembly technology. Moreover, solar photothermal energy absorption and storage performance of the microcapsules exhibited a significant enhancement due to the presence of Fe3O4 nanoparticles with unique magnetic and optical properties, and their photothermal conversion efficiency was improved by 47.9% compared to the corresponding microcapsules without Fe3O4 as presented in Fig. 4(b) and (c).

2.3.3 TiO2 shell. 
Similar to the formation of SiO2 shell, TiO2 shell can also be fabricated onto the organic PCM core through interfacial or in situ polycondensation of titania precursors with the aid of an O/W emulsion-templating system.137–140
Liu et al.141 fabricated three types of n-eicosane/TiO2-based microcapsules with different morphologies and photocatalytic effectiveness through an emulsion-templated interfacial polycondensation route under the structure-directing control with different crystallization promoters. The geometrical effect on thermal response and thermal energy-storage performance of microcapsules were investigated extensively. Jiang et al.142 fabricated microencapsulated n-eicosane with a crystalline TiO2/Fe3O4 hybrid shell through the Pickering emulsion and interfacial polycondensation. These microcapsules could immobilize Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) by covalent bonds, which could be used as enzyme carriers for bioapplications. To increase the solar-to-thermal energy storage efficiency, Fan et al.143 prepared a light-driven microencapsulated n-eicosane based on a crystalline TiO2 shell coated by graphene oxide-based copper monosulfide (CuS) (CuS-GO) nanoconverter, as shown in Fig. 5(a). The resultant n-eicosane@TiO2@CuS-GO microcapsules achieved high full-spectrum solar-to-thermal storage efficiency (97.1%) under stimulated solar light. The thermal conductivity of n-eicosane@TiO2@CuS-GO significantly increased by 39.9% compared with that of n-eicosane@TiO2.

2.3.4 Other inorganic shells. 
Theoretically, any inorganic materials with a tight nature and high thermal conductivity can be potentially used as shell materials for MEPCMs. However, the application range of inorganic shell materials depends on the encapsulation technology which can lead to the formation of core–shell structures. In addition to SiO2, CaCO3 and TiO2 shells, the fabrication of microencapsulated PCMs with other inorganic shells has also been reported in recent years.144–146
Li et al.147 prepared multifunctional microcapsules with photocatalytic and antibacterial activities based on an n-eicosane core and ZnO shell. A series of microcapsule samples were synthesized through an in situ precipitation reaction in an O/W emulsion templating system followed by a long-term aging process. Gao et al.148 fabricated bifunctional microcapsulated n-eicosane with cuprous oxide (Cu2O) shell using an emulsion templating self-assembly method and in situ precipitation for solar photocatalysis and solar thermal energy storage. Similarly, we designed a novel microencapsulated paraffin with the lead tungstate (PbWO4) shell for shielding of gamma radiation as well as thermal energy storage via self-assembly methods and in-situ precipitation.149 The multifunction microcapsules have great potential applications for building energy conservation as well as wearable personal protection in nuclear energy engineering. Recently, the direct encapsulation of PCMs with graphene and its derivatives has also attracted extensive attention and there are several publications involved in this hot topic. Zhou et al.150 prepared microcapsules by encapsulating paraffin with GO in an aqueous solution through self-assembly and the hybrid shell was constructed through the π–π interaction between GO and graphene nanoplates. The hybrid shell greatly increased the efficiency of heat transfer, thus increasing the rate of energy storage and release.
Besides thermal energy storage and thermal management, some new functions can also be introduced into the microencapsulated PCMs through wisely designing and constructing inorganic double-layered shells for PCMs.151–153 Li et al.154 reported an innovation design of microencapsulated paraffin with a TiO2/SiO2 hybrid shell. They conducted the emulsion-templated in situ copolycondensation of silica and titania precursors by using a mixture of TEOS and TBT as inorganic sources, and the high thermally conductive TiO2/SiO2 hybrid shell was successfully fabricated onto the paraffin core. Xu et al.155 prepared the microcapsulated n-docosane with SiO2 shell through interfacial polycondensation, and then a mesoporous nanoflake-like MnO2 layer was fabricated on the surface of SiO2 shell through template-directed self-assembly. These microcapsules demonstrated a higher specific capacitance than traditional MnO2/SiO2 solid particles at operation temperatures above 45 °C. The microcapsules will be a good candidate as an electrode material for supercapacitors. As shown in Fig. 5(b), Liu et al.156 prepared microencapsulated n-docosane with SiO2/nanostructural Ni(OH)2 layer-by-layer shell with the aim to enhance the heat transfer and thermal response capability of microcapsules (Table 3).

3 Form-stable phase change materials
FSPCMs can be divided into porous scaffolds and polymer scaffolds by supporting materials, and this article only discusses FSPCMs based on porous scaffolds temporarily. Porous scaffolds can be divided into carbon scaffolds, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) scaffolds and silica scaffolds, and so on, which possess low density, large specific surface area, and large aperture. These characteristics enable porous materials to remain high pore volume, large surface areas, and strong adsorption capacity.158 Porous scaffolds can effectively prevent from PCMs leakage by the capillary action during phase transition process, which have been broadly employed to encapsulate PCMs.
3.1 FSPCMs based on carbon scaffolds
Among the porous, carbon-based materials have been widely studied as one of the optimal supporting matrix materials because of their unique superiorities, including low density, superior thermal conductivity, intrinsic and structural flexibility, high chemical and thermal stability, as well as compatible traits. Carbon-based materials are more diverse, and the common ones are carbon nanotubes (CNTs)159–162 and graphene.163,164.To improve the ability of carbon-based materials to stabilize structural and mechanical properties, various multiscale macroscopic structures with excellent physical properties can be assembled, including one-dimensional (1D) fibers, two-dimensional (2D) flexible films, and independent three-dimensional (3D) interconnection structures. Therefore, carbon-based materials can be used as supporting materials for PCMs with a wide range of practical applications.

3.1.1 FSPCMs based on CNTs architectures. 
CNTs are prospective materials for the preparation of mechanically stable scaffolds because the large strains in the macrostructure of CNTs can be effectively accommodated by the transverse deformation of CNTs.165–168 CNTs are frequently added to PCMs to improve thermal conductivity, the critical to improving the thermal conductivity focus on solving the large interfacial thermal resistance between CNTs and the surrounding PCMs. Several works have been done to reduce the interfacial thermal resistance between CNTs and PCMs by functionalization. In addition, hydrophobic CNTs are likely to have aggregation phenomena between them because of strong van der Waals interactions, making them difficult to disperse in organic and inorganic solvents. Therefore, hydrophilic groups were also introduced on the surface of CNTs to improve the reactivity and dispersibility of these materials. For instance, Cao et al.169 fabricated hexadecyl acrylate-functionalized CNTs with HDA(HDA-g-SWCNTs and HDA-g-MWCNTs) by a solvent-free Diels–Alder reaction. As a result, the thermal conductivities of HDA-g-SWCNTs and HDA-g-MWCNTs were 0.47 and 0.88 W m−1 K−1, respectively, which were 134% and 339% higher than that of pure HDA. Similarly, Chen et al.170 successfully prepared flexible conductive PCM thin films based on single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), as shown in Fig. 6(a). SWCNTs hydrogels were obtained by colloidal aggregation of stable SWCNTs dispersions in CaCl2 solution. In order to remove water from the hydrogel, film1 undergoes direct evaporation, as shown in Fig. 6(b), while film2 was treated by replacing water with an organic solvent and subsequent evaporation, as shown in Fig. 6(c), which excluded surfactants and provided space between the nanotubes greatly. Compared thin film1 with thin film2, had high conductive and low tensile strength, shown in Fig. 6(d). When eicosane was encapsulated into the conductive SWCNTs skeleton, a flexible phase change film with 27.1 wt% SWCNTs content was obtained, with latent heat up to 204.8 J g−1 and electric-thermal energy storage efficiency up to 91.3%. To make full use of the advantages of CNTs and meet the practical application of composite PCMs, 1D CNTs can be made into 3D CNTs sponge. Cheng et al.171 designed a porous scaffold of chitosan (CS)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/CNTs (CPC) with layer bridge network structure by directional freezing method, as shown in Fig. 6(e). Then, PEG and CPC scaffolds were synthesized to form PCMs by vacuum infused with excellent properties, as shown in Fig. 6(f). Due to the presence of abundant macropores in the layered pores and the hydrogen bonding between the PEG molecules and the CPC scaffold, the prepared PEG@CPC composite PCMs revealed excellent thermal energy storage with a crystallinity close to 100% and an encapsulation rate of 92.6 wt%.

In addition to the use of mono CNTs to improve the thermal conductivity of PCMs, some reports use a blend of additives to improve this property. Che et al.172 prepared terpolymer with high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/boron nitride (BN)/CNTs composite PCM by hot rolling method, as shown in Fig. 6(g). Interestingly, the CNTs content increased from 0% to 20%, and the thermal conductivity of composite PCM increased rapidly from 1.02 W m−1 K−1 to 1.72 W m−1 K−1. Meanwhile, the BN content increased from 0% to 25%, the thermal conductivity of composite PCM increased rapidly from 1.02 W m−1 K−1 to 1.67 W m−1 K−1, as shown in Fig. 6(h). Similarly, Qian et al.173 encapsulated PEG with graphene nanoplate (GNP) and CNTs. The thermal conductivity of the synthesized PCMs was more than 12-fold that of pure PEG, and the corresponding solar-thermal conversion efficiency reached 86%. CNTs.


3.1.2 FSPCMs based on graphene architectures. 
Graphene is a single-atom-thick layer of carbon atoms, one of the isomers of the element carbon, in which carbon atoms are arranged into a 2-D lattice and form a monolayer with sp2 hybridization, with a bond length of 0.142 nm and a monolayer thickness of 0.35 nm. Graphene possesses excellent mechanical properties, electrical properties, thermal properties, optical properties, and large specific surface area.174–177
Parts of the researchers have attempted to improve the thermal conductivity of PCMs through graphene and its derivatives.178,179 Graphene oxide (GO) was introduced to form a hybrid network structure that significantly improved the shape stability of PCMs. The foldable and tailorable PCMs papers have been fabricated by intercalating various amounts of PEG molecules into the interlayer between the GO nanoplatelet framework.180 These interactions between the hydroxyl terminal of PEG macromolecules and the hydrogen bond on the surface of GO nanoplates promoted the arrangement of self-assembled layer-by-layer microstructure. The layered composite paper inherited the excellent flexibility of pure GO paper, can be shaped and bent as required, and had a high mechanical tensile strength. Compared with pure GO paper, GO composite paper with 5 wt% PEG could be resistant to a tensile force of 19.2 MPa. The abrasion resistance was enhanced, and the range of applications was expanded. The results indicated that the number of PEG molecules can influence the interlayer spacing, which can be used to regulate the freezing temperature and control the exothermic process. Using low dimensional nanomaterials to construct a 2D network structure, Wu et al.181 introduced a strategy for the synthesis of high thermal conductivity phase change composite in graphite sheets, as shown in Fig. 7(a). The obtained PCM exhibits homogeneity, structure stability, and excellent phase transition behavior, which can be easily designed as an efficient heat harvesting device by coordinating the sheet orientation and heat transfer direction. The PCMs showed high thermal conductivity in a range of 4.4–35.0 W m−1 K−1 at graphite loadings below 40.0 wt%. More, the resulting flexible composite PCMs showed excellent mechanical properties, such as a high tensile strength of 2.42 MPa and bending resistance of >100 cycles.

In order to further improve the thermal conductivity, graphene aerogel fibers (GAFs) with a directional 3D interconnect network were prepared by injecting graphene oxide (GO) liquid crystal into VC/HCl solution and chemical reduction and supercritical drying, as shown in Fig. 7(b).182 By permeating PCMs into GAFs and further times higher Young's modulus (1.2 GPa) than graphene/PEG fibres (7.5 MPa) and (300 MPa) respectively. And the fracture strength and Young's modulus of PEG-ASF are 775% higher than GAF (1.45 MPa) and 48 times higher than GAF (25 MPa), respectively. When PEG was heated to a molten state, the fracture strength of ASF decreased and the fracture strain and toughness increased with the softening of PEG. The results showed that the compact packing of graphene/PEG4000 nanolaminates and FC coatings had a synergistic effect on the overall mechanical properties of coherent coke-shell fibers. As a result of conductive and photo absorbing graphene networks, ASFs demonstrate excellent multi-responsiveness to external electrical and photonic stimuli, accompanied by reversible thermal energy conversion and storage. In addition to the addition of graphene or GO to improve the thermal conductivity of PCMs, some research is being conducted using hybrid nano additives to achieve this purpose. Badakhsh et al.183 combined GNP with length-controlled CNTs lengths of 30, 50, and 120 μm to enhance the thermal conductivity of paraffin. As a result, the different lengths of CNTs all displayed a trend of reduced thermal conductivity as the ratio of CNTs to GNP increased in the composite PCMs, which revealed that GNP could offer an excellent formation of conductive pathways within paraffin and worked as bridging elements between the CNTs aggregation zones. The most significant increase in tensile strength of up to 95.4% has been achieved.
Ternary additives have also been utilized to impressively increase thermal conductivity. Xue et al.184 utilized melamine foam (PMF) with incorporated GO and GNPs to encapsulate paraffin, as shown in Fig. 7(c). As a result, the highest thermal conductivity of the paraffin@PMF/rGO/GNP composite PCM reached 1.46 W m−1 K−1 at an additive content of 4.89 wt%, which was 421% higher than that of pure paraffin, as shown in Fig. 7(d).


3.1.3 FSPCMs based on other porous carbon-based materials. 
Other porous carbon-based materials derived from biomass are cheap, non-toxic, and highly absorbent which makes them be ideal supporting materials. The porous carbon-supported PCMs composites have achieved excellent shape stability, high thermal and photo absorption properties. Li et al.185 prepared carbon aerogels by hydrothermal carbonization and post-pyrolysis using various watermelons as raw materials. The paraffin was melted by vacuum impregnation and then added into carbon aerogel (CA) and the maximum paraffin loading obtained was 95%. The BET specific surface area of wax gourd and pumpkin CA was 114 m2 g−1 and 5 m2 g−1, respectively, and the pore size was about 200 μm. At 53.5 °C and 48.3 °C, the melting enthalpy was 115.2 J g−1 and freezing enthalpy was 126.9 J g−1. The shape stability of the composite was achieved at 100 °C and there was no leakage from the CA even after 20 melting and freezing cycles.
Tan et al.186 prepared porous carbon from fresh potatoes. PEG-4000 was melted in ethanol at 70 °C and powdered porous carbon was added during the ultrasound. The porous carbon-PEG composite PCM was obtained by removing solvent. The analysis of DSC indicated that the composite with a maximum load of 50% PEG had a melting temperature of 56.35 °C and enthalpy of 91.80 J g−1, and a freezing temperature of 39.81 °C and enthalpy of 81.80 J g−1. The shape stability test of porous carbon/PEG loading at 80 °C showed that no shape deformation was observed. The seepage stability of FSPCMs was tested by diffusion–infiltration cycle test, and the samples were placed on filter paper and heated at 80 °C for 2 h. Only faint exudation spots were observed on the filter paper. In addition, it was observed that the sample after the shape stabilization and exudation test became denser as the PEG melted and filled the pores of the composite structure. Wang et al.187 have reported the creation of novel FSPCMs by adding 1-hexadecane amine (HDA) and palmitic acid (PA) to biomass carbon aerogel (BCA), and BCA referred to sunflower receptacle spongy carbon aerogel (r-CA) and sunflower stem carbon aerogel (s-CA) by simple vacuum perfusion. The PCMs had the characteristics of large porosity, lightweight, and large specific surface area, and could be automatically loaded into BCA with a loading rate up to 1988 wt%. The enthalpy of PCM/BCA composite was between 207.9 J g−1 and 271 J g−1. It had good thermal stability and could be recycled. The enthalpy of PCM/BCA composite remained even after 50 heating/freezing cycles and the thermal conductivity of PCM/BCA composites was also improved. HDA/r-CA and HDA/s-CA with a photo-thermal conversion efficiency of 75.6% and 67.8% had the advantages of abundant resources, high cost, simple manufacturing process, and scalability, making them good choices for photo-thermal energy storage applications. The small interfacial distance and mild hydrophilicity of graphite make it difficult to insert PCMs into the graphite layer, however, expanded graphite (EG) is a solution to this problem. Moreover, studies showed that EG supported PCM composites achieved shape-stability with high PCM loadings. Due to high affinity for organic PCMs, the EG based composite PCMs are widely utilized in building materials,188 solar energy conversion189 and thermal energy storage applications.190 Zhang et al.191 have made a form-stable EG/paraffin composite with high energy storage density. The EG used in the preparation of composite was prepared by microwave radiation and prepared at 800 W irradiation power for 10 s, exhibited high sorption capacity of 92% paraffin. More, the BET surface area of EG was found to be 60.72 m2 g−1. The interconnected open pores of EG prevented the leakage of paraffin, hence realizing the shape stability of EG/paraffin. According to the DSC curves, the total latent heats of the paraffin and composite PCMs were 188.2 J g−1 and 170.3 J g−1, respectively. In the study of Tang's group,192 PCMs with low melting point were prepared by using decanoic acid and lauric acid as substrates and oleic acid (C–L–O acid) as additive. C–L–O acid was impregnated into wormlike EG to form PCMs with a stable shape without any chemical reaction. EG was not only a heat transfer enhancer but also a shape-stable container for C–L–O acid. More results showed that when the mass ratio of EG to C–L–O acid was 1:35, the melting enthalpy of FSPCMs was 114.65 J g−1, which was very close to the original melting enthalpy of C–L–O acid (115.91 J g−1). After comprehensive consideration of latent heat and thermal conductivity, 1:15 FSPCMs was selected as the optimal FSPCMs, with ΔHm of 109.18 J g−1 and thermal conductivity of 1.95 W m−1 K−1.
For the organic phase change material PEG, a lot of research work has been reported. Wang et al.193 reported the composite was prepared a new FSPCMs by blending PEG with EG. PEG and EG were used as PCMs and supporting materials, respectively. There was no liquid PEG leakage in EG network due to capillary force and surface tension. The solid–solid transition properties of these composites were sensitive to the proportion of components. The maximum mass percentage of PEG in composites is 90 wt%. At this ratio, the enthalpy of PEG/EG composite was 161.2 J g−1, and the melting temperature was 61.46 °C, and the conductivity of the composite was 1.324 W m−1 K−1. The pore structure of EG formed a thermal conductivity network, which greatly improved its thermal conductivity.

3.2 FSPCMs based on metal–organic frameworks
As a continuous skeletal structure, metal skeletons, organic frameworks and metal–organic frameworks have been extensively investigated. Among them, metal foams with high strength-to-density ratios, high open porosity (85–98%), large pore sizes (0.1–5 mm), high specific strength and relatively high thermal conductivity are considered as prospective supporting material in improving the overall thermal conductivity and phase transition period of the system. Various metal foams, such as copper foam194,195 stainless steel foams,196 nickel foams197 and aluminium foams,198 have been investigated as supporting materials for FSPCMs due to their high thermal conductivity. However, metal foams as supporting materials suffer from high leakage rates, poor compatibility with the PCMs and inherent stiffness. Organic framework effectively encapsulates the high content of organic PCMs due to its low density and porous adsorption properties, such as melamine foam,199,200 polyurethane foam.201 Based on the elasticity of the foam and the phase transition of the PCMs, the composite materials were endowed with shape memory properties and making flexible. However, organic framework with low strength and low thermal conductivity in the process of application.
To solve these problems, the researchers found that metal–organic frameworks could be introduced into the PCMs system as supporting materials to obtain FSPCMs with even superior properties. MOFs are microscopically zeolite-like structures that differ from conventional inorganic zeolites in that they contain both organic ligands and metal ions in their structural units. Because of their excellent properties, MOFs are one of the most prominent types of coordination chemistry, distinguished from conventional materials by their diverse spatial structure, high porosity, controllable pore size and large specific surface area. MOFs also exhibit versatile suitability in various applications such as heterogeneous catalysis, nanomedicines, polymer encapsulation, adsorption of volatile organic compounds, and water technology. However, the use of pristine MOFs as the PCMs supporting materials in thermal energy storage can suffer from several demerits, such as considerably low electrical conductivity, thermal transport performance, and low chemical/mechanical/thermal stabilities.202–204 There are abundant possibilities to design MOFs composites with other functional materials for the encapsulation of PCMs, in turn, which can offer alternatives for multiple applications such as electrical and thermal energy storage.
For instance, Luan et al.205 made PCMs with fatty acid@MOF for low-temperature heat storage, as shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b). The results showed that the PCMs composites have owned great thermal stability, which was maintained after 50 cycles. What's more, the results also showed that one-step synthesized MIL-101-NH2 provided the most optimal thermal properties and the highest stearic acid mass percentage achieved at 70 wt%, which corresponds to the highest loading and highest enthalpy in the literature for organic acid derived form-stabilized PCMs. The large interior surface accessibility of the MOFs played a vital role in enhancing the thermal properties of the synthesized composite PCMs. Similarly, the FSPCMs based on a 3D porous (3,6)-connected metal-MOF and PEG were designed by Dimberu et al.206 The resulting composite material exhibited a high transition enthalpy up to 159.8 J g−1, and with an encapsulation efficiency and impregnation ratio of 93.4% and 92.2%, respectively. Tang et al.207 reported 1D meso–macroporous MOF hollow tubes with large pore diameter (5–136 nm) firstly. The 1D meso–macroporous MOF had synthesized through the coordination of Cr3+ with alkylated bridged ligands based on alkylated meso–macroporous Cr-MIL-101 hollow tubes (ACHT). Octadecane was used as an organic PCM to probe the influence of the ACHT on the crystallization behavior of PCMs, as shown in Fig. 8(c). The results showed the octadecane@ACHT FSPCMs with high crystallinity of octadecane had excellent thermal storage capacity and good thermal regulation, as shown in Fig. 8(d), and could be used in the interior walls of buildings to improve indoor thermal comfort or in the field of thermal regulated textiles and clothing.

To improve the thermal conductivity of PCMs, adding nanoparticles always is a good choice. Dimberu et al.208 reported the utility of a nanocomposite composed of a MOF and graphite was explored for form-stable PCMs. In this literature, the prepared MOF-integrated graphite featured favourable structural characteristics such as large specific surface area 550.6 m2 g−1, increased total pore volume, and dominant mesopore structure. More, the composite also with a high energy storage capacity for 111.4 J g−1 exhibited an electrical resistivity that was at least 7 orders of magnitude lower than that of the pristine PCMs, as shown in Fig. 8(e) and (f). Similarly, Li et al.209 introduced GO into the PCMs system successfully, they synthesized hierarchical 3D reduced graphene-porous carbon supporting PCMs by carbonizing GO@MOFs template with large phase change enthalpy and high thermal conductivity. 3D network structure promoted the stretching and crystallization characteristics of SA molecules in the confined pore space, which was used for enhanced heat release efficiency. The results showed thermal conductivity was 27.7% improvement, with large phase change latent heat to 168.7 J g−1 that increased by 18.5%.
In addition, in order to further improve the comprehensive properties of phase change materials, scholars also tried other preparation methods. Andriamitantsoa et al.210 have synthesized benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (BTC) that bridged an organic–inorganic hybrid porous metal–organic gel (MOG) based on Cr3+. In this literature, the porosity of MOG-100 (Cr) guaranteed excellent thermal stability of the encapsulated stearic acid. The highest loading of composites was 90 wt% of SA and the corresponding latent heat was 189.3 J g−1, and these had excellent thermal recyclability within at least 15 melting/freezing cycles.
3.3 FSPCMs based on other scaffolds
Silica aerogels are inorganic amorphous material with the highly porous form of SiO2 and are widely used for in situ encapsulation of organic PCMs due to their excellent mechanical properties, high surface area, thermal and chemical stability. The group of Wang introduced the CH3-riched trimethylmethoxysilane molecules into the siloxane skeleton to tune the crosslinking degree of the network,211 which modified it from the originally rigid structure with a high crosslinking degree to a flexible structure with a depressed crosslinking degree. The as-prepared silica aerogel could be compressed up to 60% deformation and recovered to its original shape after removing the compressive stress. Moreover, the attachment of plentiful CH3 groups to the siloxane backbone endowed the aerogel with the hydrophobic property. After filling with paraffin, the monolithic paraffin/silica aerogel composite could retain compressibility and restorability, as well as possess the satisfying latent heat of 122.7 J g−1 and good thermal stability. Other than paraffin, PEG possessing longer molecular chains have also been confined within silica network. Wang et al.212 focused on PEG/SiO2 PCM composites with different weight ratios ranging from 95 wt% to 5 wt%. Due to capillary force and surface tension, liquid PEG did not leak out of the porous SiO2 network, and the results showed that the maximum weight percentage of PEG dispersed in the PCM composite was up to 85% without leakage, and had a large enthalpy of 162.9 J g−1 and suitable melting temperature of 61.61 °C. Meanwhile, thermal conductivity was also improved. In order to improve thermal conductivity, Tang et al.213 polymerized Cu in situ to PEG/SiO2 PCM, the phase change enthalpy of Cu/PEG/SiO2 PCM reached up to 110 J g−1, and the thermal conductivity was 0.414 W m−1 K−1 for 2.1 wt% Cu in PEG/SiO2. In other work, Wang et al.214 doped β-aluminum nitride (β-AlN) into PEG1000/SiO2, and the thermal conductivity changed from 0.3847 W m−1 K−1 to 0.7661 W m−1 K−1 with an increase in the mass ratio of β-AlN from 5% to 30%. To expand the use of PCMs, the researchers added flame-retardant materials. Fang et al.215 reported PA/SiO2 composites with flame retardant. The result showed the addition of melamine improved thermal stability and the microstructure of the charred residue after combustion indicated that the homogeneous and compact charred residue decreased the flammability of the composites.
PCMs in construction can be extensively supported by titanium dioxide (TiO2). It is a low-cost, fireproof material with high thermal conductivity that is environmentally friendly and low-cost. Based on the physical interactions between the PEG and TiO2 nanostructures, Deng et al.216 prepared composite PCMs with a flower-like TiO2 nanostructure. Sharma et al.217 compounded PA with TiO2 to form PCMs. A chemical and thermal stability improvement was achieved by adding TiO2 to PA as well as an increase in its electrical conductivity. In recent years, porous TiO2 has received much attention because of its high specific surface area, high catalytic activity, high thermal stability, high chemical stability, porous structure, non-toxicity, low density and other excellent properties used as a supporting matrix for PCMs. A series of n-octadecane/TiO2 were prepared by Li et al.218 It was shown that the porous TiO2 exhibited high adsorption of n-octadecane and the relative enthalpy of the composite PCMs was as high as 85.8 J g−1. Compared with pure n-octadecane, the thermal conductivity of the prepared composite PCMs after the addition of porous TiO2 increased by 138%. After 800 melting/solidification cycles, the composite PCMs exhibited good thermal reliability and high enthalpy.
Beside SiO2 and TiO2, polymer melt blending and intramolecular crosslinking were also one of the effective methods to prepare FSPCMs. In the FSPCMs with great thermal stability,219 which were found that the leakage phenomenon of PCMs was effectively improved, and the latent heat value of PCMs was increased. Therefore, PCMs shaped by polymer matrix, such as Polyacrylates,220 Polyolefins,221,222 Styrene based block copolymers,223,224 polysaccharides,225 polyurethane226 have received much attention and have been extensively reported in the literature. To improve the loading of PCMs, various types of porous polymers have been constructed as supporting materials for PCMs. For example, Li et al.227 prepared conjugated micro- and meso-porous polymers with large surface areas as supporting materials for n-carboxylic acid PCMs, in which no leakage was observed over 300 melting and freezing cycles. In Wang's group,228 imine-linked micro-network polymers with high PEGs loading were proven to be excellent FSPCMs with high energy storage efficiency and favorable PEG adsorption capacity (up to 85 wt%). However, porous polymers have disadvantages such as low thermal conductivity, poor stability at high temperatures and the potential for aggregation or decomposition under environmental conditions. Therefore, there is still much work to be done to improve the thermal conductivity and structural stability to enable them to be used in a wide range of applications.
4 Sustainable application of PCMs
The ability of PCMs to absorb and release heat in the form of latent heat in a defined range of temperatures can impart thermoregulating effect in the integrated environment. Organic PCMs are particularly popular in thermal energy storage as these are available in the temperature range from −5 °C to 190 °C. Organic PCMs are primarily selected based on phase change temperature that can meet the requirements of the specific application.229–232 The PCMs and their mixtures with phase change temperature around 18–65 °C are utilized for the thermal energy storage in batteries, electronics, textiles, solar photovoltaic, and buildings.233,234 Moreover, the properties of form-stable PCMs such as excellent thermal conductivity, high storage density, and minimum supercooling could promote their performance and potential in thermal energy storage. PCMs are widely used in thermal management of batteries, thermal regulation of electronic devices, solar energy systems, smart textile, energy-saving buildings.235,236
4.1 Thermal management of batteries
Homo-thermal phase transition of PCMs allows them to absorb heat from the hot reservoir or release heat to cold target, thus PCMs are ideal materials for thermal management solutions in various scenarios. To meet the increasing functional requirements of people, electronic equipment is gradually developed to be highly integrated, such as high-energy battery packs and high-performance chips. Therefore, a large amount of heat is likely to accumulate in the equipment, accompanied by circuit failure.
Using the large latent heat of PCM during phase transition, the temperature of the battery can be kept within the range of phase transition temperature for a long time, which can slow down the aging process of the battery and prolong the service life of the battery. In addition to improved thermal conductivity, the PCMs minimize the temperature difference of the battery pack. The passive thermal management system based on PCMs has attracted extensive attention because of its strong heat dissipation capacity and compact structure. For example, Wu et al.237 fabricated a battery thermal management system based on heat pipe-assisted PCMs, as shown in Fig. 9(a). During operation, the heat generated inside the battery was absorbed by the PCM and then transmitted to the condenser section through the evaporation section of the heat pipe, as shown in Fig. 9(b). On one hand, due to the addition of EG with high thermal conductivity, the thermal conductivity of composite PCM was about 30 times of pure PN; on the other hand, the heat pipe acted as a heat conductor to further improve the heat absorption rate of the PCM@EG composite and to draw heat from the battery pack to the external environment. In other future similar work, Ling et al.238 presented an optimization method for the hybrid thermal management system of batteries and helped design an efficient thermal management system with a simple structure and lightweight. Five 2.6 A h Type 18650 Li-ion batteries were connected in series and four in parallel. Moreover, increasing the EG mass fraction and density led to the high thermal conductivity of the PCMs. In short, in order to reduce the temperature and temperature difference in the cell center, it was important to improve the thermal conductivity of the PCMs, because the high thermal conductivity of the PCMs ensured fast heat dissipation of the cell to the cooling medium.

In order to improve the coating properties of PCMs and batteries, flexible thin films have been made of PCMs. Wu et al.239 reported highly thermally conductive and flexible OBC/EG/paraffin composites for efficient battery thermal management, as shown in Fig. 9(c)–(g). The PN-OBC/EG composite film could suffer a little higher tension before damage when the temperature rose from 25 °C to 35 °C, while the flexibility of the PN-OBC/EG composite film was significantly increased at 50 °C. The composites were assembled into flexible films that could be easily attached to cylindrical lithium-ion batteries. Thanks to the well-assembled composite, the cell surface temperature showed a higher reduction than the cell exposed to the environment. The experimental results showed that the PCMs wrapped around the battery could achieve good thermal management performance.
Another similar research was conducted by employing a flexible composite composed of eicosane, OBC, and EG that was used to attach with a lithium battery by Huang's group.240 The thermal contact resistance was 461 mm2 K W−1 with the use of flexible PCMs and 1818 mm2 K W−1 with conventional PCMs, which indicated the advantages of flexible PCMs. The temperature of the battery pack decreased by 6.5 °C using flexible PCMs compared with conventional PCMs due to the low thermal contact resistance.
4.2 Thermal regulation of electronic devices
Except for the battery thermal management, PCMs could also be employed as the thermal protection media for another electron device. Chen et al.241 proposed a facile, low-cost, and controllable strategy to construct compactly interconnected 3D celosia-like highly graphitized thermally conductive network via carbon quantum dots (CQDs) deriving from acetone and divinyl benzene (DVB), as shown in Fig. 10(a)–(d). The PCMs are applied to the intercalation of the CPU, and the main function was to transfer and store heat energy, to buffer the excessively high temperature of the computer CPU when the temperature rose rapidly. In the paper, the results could ensure that the final temperature of the CPU could be lower than 70 °C according to the phase change platform after the PCMs penetrated the CPU, thus prolonging the service life of the CPU.

Wang et al.242 demonstrated a passive thermal management strategy that coated MIL-101(Cr) powders onto the metallic substrate through the desorption process of water inside sorbents, as shown in Fig. 10(g) and (h). In addition, part of the heat was removed during desorption and transferred to the environment through steam diffusion, thus suppressing the tendency of temperature increase. The maximum temperature was reduced by 7 °C after the 15 minutes stress test.
However, due to the complex shape and small size of electronic devices, PCMs are difficult to be tightly integrated with the devices, so they cannot play to their thermal control function adequately. In this case, the flexibility of PCMs can be used to improve the fitness to solve the bonding installation problem. Xu et al.220 prepared the flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors with in situ implantation of microencapsulated PCMs into the electrode materials which could retard the temperature fluctuation and enhance the operation stability at high temperature, as shown in Fig. 11(a) and (b). After 6000 charges–discharges and 500 bending cycles, the capacity of the supercapacitor remained 90.19% and 94.1%, respectively. In other similar work, Wang et al.244 designed a nano-porous boron nitride (BN) aerogel film infiltrated by paraffin that reduced the heat transfer from electronic devices to the skin significantly, which served as a thermal regulator utilized in portable electronics, as shown in Fig. 11(c) and (d)). This thermal management strategy of flexible BN aerogel film contributed to the miniaturization, integration, and intelligence of portable 5G electronic devices in the future.

Keeping the body temperature within an appropriate range is an important issue in today's society. PCMs can reversibly absorb and release latent heat and act as a passive thermal control medium to regulate the local temperature near the skin. When the external temperature rises above the melting point, PCMs absorb heat through a phase transition and buffer the heat conducted to the skin. When the external temperature drops below the crystallization point, the PCMs release stored latent heat to prevent drastic temperature changes. Flexible PCMs that conform to the curvature change of the skin can achieve efficient thermal regulation effects. Chang et al.245 developed a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coated PU sponges-based flexible phase change composite which could be charged rapidly by solar energy and developed it for wearable thermotherapy through conformally wrapping onto a human wrist, as shown in Fig. 11(e) and (f).
4.3 Energy conversion
Recently, energy conversion, storage and utilization based on PCMs have become a hot research topic, especially for solar energy, industrial waste heat and waste heat energy conversion. Currently, light-thermal, electro-thermal and magnetic-thermal energy conversion have been developed with the help of PCMs to realize the effective conversion and utilization of energy.
For light-thermal, Liu et al.246 had synthesized a new polymer containing organic/inorganic hybrid siloxy functional group successfully and applied the hybrid polymer (HP) with paraffin wax (PW) and carbon black (CB) to light-to-thermal conversion system, as shown in Fig. 12(a). The photothermal conversion curve of HP/CB-PCMs (5:5) and pure PW recording from a photothermal conversion device, as shown in Fig. 12(c). The initial temperature of the two materials was the same (30 °C), as shown in Fig. 12(d) and (e). Under a 110 m W cm−2 sunlight simulation condition, the temperature of the sample and pure PN increased with illumination time, but the temperature rise rate of the PCMs composite was much prompter than that of pure PW owing to the superior light response-ability derived from CB inside. Based on the temperature change curves of the HP encapsulated PCMs composition and the latent heat of the PCMs composite, the light-to-thermal conversion efficiency was calculated to be 93.7%. The FSPCMs had strong solar energy capture ability, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and high thermal conductivity, which significantly improves the efficiency of the solar energy system.
 Fig. 12  (a) Schematic illustration of the preparation and comparison of the energy storage and release performance of PN and HP/CB-OPCMs, (b) schematic diagram of the thermal energy storage and release tests, (c) photothermal conversion device, and (d) light-to-thermal energy conversion curves for pure PN and HP/CB-OPCMs (5:5) and photo of light-on, (e) photo of light-off process and comparison of results reported by different scholar.246 
Prakash et al.247 designed and developed a solar hot water heating system with a customized regenerative tank based on PN, puretemp68, and SA/PA, and performed a real-time evaluation of its performance. The results showed that the performance of the SA/PA eutectic mixture was superior to that of PN and comparable to that of the puretemp68 storage system. The water heating efficiency of SA/PA was 55%, which was higher than that of PN (20%) and superior to that of puretemp68 (45%).
The applications of PCMs for electrical-thermal energy conversion, which convert excess electrical energy into heat during non-peak periods and then release the stored thermal energy during peak periods, have shown great promise for “power peaking” applications. Zhang et al.248 prepared electrically driven composite PCMs and systematically investigated its electrical heating and thermal energy release properties. The experimental results indicated that the resistivity of the composite PCMs decreased to 489 Ω cm after the additive of 1.78 vol% CNF, and their energy storage capacity were 5 times higher than that of the conventional thermal storage medium ceramic tiles. Chen et al.249 prepared paraffin/CNT multifunctional composite PCMs, which was able to perform electro-thermal energy conversion at a small voltage (1.5 V) with electro-thermal energy conversion efficiencies of 40.6% and 52.5% driven by 1.5 V and 1.75 V, respectively. The paraffin-based composite PCMs prepared by Li et al.250, which reached an electrical conductivity of 3.4 S m−1. When a 15 V voltage was applied for electro-thermal energy conversion, the final energy conversion efficiency was 71.4%. Li et al.251 utilized ordered GO liquid crystals as precursors, combined with vapor diffusion and sol–gel methods, followed by supercritical drying and annealing at 600 °C in argon atmosphere to obtain composite PCMs. The material underwent electro-thermal energy conversion at an applied small voltage (1–3 V) with an efficiency of 85%. Shi et al.252 reported a PEG-based PCMs film with a temperature–time profile of the composite PCMs representing a stable temperature plateau during heating and cooling, corresponding to the storage and release of latent heat. When the input current was between (0.5–1.5) A, the electro-thermal conversion efficiency tended to increase with increasing current and reaches up to 94% at a heating current of 1.5 A.
The application of PCMs for magnetic-thermal capability conversion has also received a lot of attention during recent years. Tang's group253 loaded magnetic Fe3O4 onto the surface of graphene (Fe3O4-GNS) and then added it to PEG matrix to prepare composite PCMs. The nanocomposite can not only absorb light energy effectively and perform light-thermal energy conversion, but also achieve magnetic-thermal energy conversion under the effect of alternating magnetic field. The alternating current generator generates an alternating magnetic field of a certain strength, which is applied to the composite phase change material. Fe3O4-GNS as a nano-heater, triggering the magnetic-thermal energy conversion, and the temperature change is recorded in real time using a fiber optic sensor and data collector. The higher the content of Fe3O4-GNS in the composite for the same time of action, the faster the heating rate and the higher the maximum temperature produced. Similarly, a phase transition plateau appeared during the heating and cooling process, and its magnetic-thermal conversion efficiency increased with the increase of Fe3O4-GNS content in the composite, with the maximum conversion efficiency reaching 41.7%. In further research, the group synthesized a new PEG/SiO2/Fe3O4 composite phase change material for the magnetic-thermal energy conversion system and obtained experimental results and conclusions consistent with the above.254
In Yang's work,255 high-performance heat transfer-enhanced composite PCMs can be prepared by combining polypyrrole/Fe3O4-functionalized hollow kapok fiber (KF) aerogel carriers with Pn. The prepared composite PCMs achieved high thermal storage density (161.4 J g−1 enthalpy of melting for 88% Pn loading mass fraction), greatly improved thermal conductivity (1.06 W m−1 K−1, 307% higher than the Pn) and excellent cyclic thermal stability. The composite PCMs could achieve magnetic-thermal energy conversion capability under the effect of alternating magnetic fields, exhibited very low magnetic retention and coercivity, and confirmed the typical superparamagnetic behavior.
4.4 Smart textile
One of the basic functions of smart fabric is to provide the relatively stable ambient temperature of the human body. Phase change energy storage material has the characteristics of large heat storage capacity and almost constant phase change temperature. If it is applied to textiles, the thermal insulation performance and temperature regulation function of textiles can be greatly improved. At present, the main method of preparing smart textiles using phase change energy storage materials is to infiltrate PCMs into fibers, fabrics, and foams. In addition, PCMs with phase change temperatures ranging from 18 °C to 35 °C are most suitable for smart textile.
Herein, Aftab et al.256 explored a phosphorene based bandgap engineered broadband photonic nanoheater for efficient thermal charging of solid–solid PCMs. The latent heat storage capacity up to 150 J g−1 was improved under low phosphorus doping level (1 wt%) and full solar spectrum, and the storage efficiency of solar energy was still more than 95%, as shown in Fig. 13(a) and (b).Wu et al.257 demonstrated a skin-friendly personal insulation textile and a thermoregulation textile that could perform both passive heating and cooling using the same piece of textile with zero energy input, as shown in Fig. 13(c). According to the characterization of thermal insulation textiles, at isothermal environments of 50 °C and 10 °C, the proposed temperature-regulated textiles exhibited slower heating and cooling rates than polyester gloves and can extend skin comfortable time by up to 70 and 115 seconds significantly, as shown in Fig. 13(d), respectively. In addition, the proposed temperature-regulated textiles can be further extended to achieve different temperature applications by filling different PCMs. The PCMs and the preparation process are compatible with the existing textile industry and the obtained material thermal, wear and mechanical properties are satisfactory, which also makes mass production possible and facilitates practical individual thermal management.

4.5 Energy-saving building
With the improvement of living standards, people's demand for the comfort of the interior environment of buildings is increasing daily, resulting in a large amount of energy consumption, especially in summer and winter. In China, the total energy consumption of buildings accounts for more than 30% of the total energy consumption. Developing and promoting energy-saving buildings is one of the effective ways to reduce energy consumption. Adding PCMs into the building system can not only reduce energy consumption but also improve the residential comfort of buildings. Therefore, building material components such as wall panels, floors, ceilings, concrete, and plasterboard can be combined with phase change materials to improve their respective performance.
Xia et al.258 developed a new type of PCM double-layer radiant floor system. The system could store thermal or cold energy during off-peak periods and use it during peak periods, and the new system could be operated in summer and winter without the need for additional cooling systems. The temperature field of a two-layer radiant floor system was studied in two experimental devices. The experimental results showed that the two-layer radiant floor system with PCM met the thermal demand of users. Li et al.259 used three kinds of PCMs with different phase change temperatures. Two types of composite wall panels were prepared to adapt to temperature changes in different seasons (29 °C in summer, 18 °C in spring and autumn, and 12 °C in winter). The thermal properties of PCMs wallboard were evaluated by protective hot plate method. The experimental results showed that PCMs were more suitable for practical application, and the new three-layer composite gypsum wallboard could effectively reduce building energy consumption and improve living comfort. Similarly, Yao et al.260 investigated wallboard with FSPCMs wallboard in which paraffin and EP supporting material were mixed using a horizontal vacuum absorption rotating roller. The melting and freezing temperatures of the used PCMs are approximately 27.6 °C and 23.5 °C, respectively.
5 Conclusion and perspective
Energy storage technology is considered to be an effective way to solve energy supply and achieve sustainable development. It is accepted that TES with PCMs is a practical and feasible way to energy conservation and emission reduction for sustainable energy use. The realization of TES function relies on energy absorption, storage and release in PCMs during phase change process. Furthermore, the conversion efficiency of TES largely depends on the nature of PCMs. Positive progress on shape stability, thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of PCMs have been achieved, which greatly promotes their applications. This review attaches an importance on the research progress on microencapsulation of PCMs (MEPCMs) and form-stable PCMs (FSPCMs) for improving the shape stability. In addition, enhanced thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of PCMs with incorporating into nanoparticles and other aspects are critically introduced. Besides, their applications in thermal management of devices, smart textiles, intelligent buildings and other fields are also discussed.
Although diverse strategies have been applied to improve the integrated performance of PCMs for TES various applications, much efforts such as shape variation and adaptability need to be conducted for its application in some specific fields. For example, personal thermal management and flexible electronic devices require PCMs capable of sufficient ductility and toughness besides enhanced thermal conductivity. Thus, there are still challenges in tailoring integrated performance of PCM for application developments. The following is some directions for encouraging exploration:
(1) Good shape stability, high thermal conductivity, and excellent mechanical properties are prerequisite to ensure efficient utilization of PCMs. At present, the integrated performance of PCMs can be improved by adding nanomaterials of different dimensions, such as 1D nanotubes or 2D nanosheets. For example, CNTs, GO, etc. were prepared as nanostructures of different dimensions and added to PCMs, which could improve the thermal conductivity of PCMs. However, the current thermal conductivity mechanism has limitations in explaining how nanoparticles enhance thermal conductivity. Thus, the development of new methods and mechanisms for nanoparticles to construct structures can be a guide to further optimize the properties of PCMs.
(2) Flexibility is a typical characteristics of advanced electronic device thermal management, human thermal regulation, and other smart applications. Currently, the developed composite PCMs have high brittleness and low mechanical strength, which cannot meet the requirements of flexibility. Therefore, it is necessary to develop flexible PCMs for wide applications. At present, the study of flexible PCMs is still in a relatively primary stage, and the definition and characterization of flexibility are not mature. Therefore, the establishment of flexible standards and corresponding measurement methods to provide guidance for subsequent research is also worth our attention.
(3) As a sustainable development clear energy source, the rational and effective use of solar energy is considered one of the most useful solutions to current energy issues. It requires a great deal of technological innovation, especially in solar thermal energy storage. PCMs is a feasible and valid candidate to tackle this challenge, which is capable of thermal energy storage and release during the phase change process. Note that limited light absorption ability of PCMs is negative to direct and effective thermal energy conversion from solar energy. In recent years, dyes and carbon materials have been used to significantly promote the light absorption ability of PCMs. However, its conversion efficiency is still difficult to meet the requirements of social developments. Thus, constructing unique structures and exploring energy conversion mechanism contributes to improving light-thermal conversion and storage efficiency of PCMs.
(4) Application development of PCMs deserves to be performed for meeting the increasing requirements of social developments. Much importance has been attached to the function of various nanoparticles and constructing multidimensional structures that enables the multifunctionality of PCMs, such as radiation shielding, photocatalysis. In recent years, some researchers have applied phase change materials to drug delivery, aerospace and other fields, but there seems to be a long way to go before the theories are really implemented in practice. Thus, combined with specific application which is still to be explored and researched for further application development of PCMs.
