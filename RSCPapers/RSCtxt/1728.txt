    , Accepted 6th December 2017First published on 6th December 2017AbstractAn experimental strategy for systematically assessing the influence of surface passivation layers on the photocatalytic properties of nanowire photoanodes by combining photocurrent analysis, photoluminescence spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy with a systematic variation of sample structure and the surrounding electrolyte is demonstrated. Following this approach we can separate the impact on recombination and transport processes of photogenerated carriers. We apply this strategy to analyze the influence of ultra-thin TiO2, CeO2 and Al2O3 coatings deposited by atomic layer deposition on the photoelectrochemical performance of InxGa1−xN/GaN nanowire (NW) photoelectrodes. The passivation of surface states results in an increase of the anodic photocurrent (PC) by a factor of 2.5 for the deposition of 5 nm TiO2. In contrast, the PC is reduced for CeO2- and Al2O3-coated NWs due to enhanced defect recombination in the passivation layer or increased band discontinuities. Furthermore, photoelectrochemical oxidation of the InxGa1−xN/GaN NW photoelectrode is attenuated by the TiO2 layer and completely suppressed for a layer thickness of 7 nm or more. Due to efficient charge transfer from the InxGa1−xN NW core a stable TiO2-covered photoanode with visible light excitation is realized.
Introduction
In recent years semiconductor photocatalysis and especially the possibility of photoelectrochemical water splitting on semiconductor surfaces has drawn interest as a clean method to produce hydrogen by conversion of solar energy.1,2 For a photoelectrochemical water splitting cell both cathode and anode materials need to be optimized, and at least one of the electrodes needs to be a photoelectrode. Typical photoanode materials for the demanding 4-hole oxidation of water are metal oxides like TiO2, as they are stable in aqueous solutions and efficiently enhance photo-activated electrode reactions.1,3 However, those materials leak in their high band gap of typically more than 3 eV, meaning only the ultraviolet regime of the solar spectrum can be used to drive the photocatalytic reaction.
The InxGa1−xN material system (InGaN) excellently matches the solar spectrum, as the band gap can be shifted from the ultraviolet into the visible regime by adjusting the In-content x in the alloy,4,5 thus allowing the absorption in a broad spectral range of the solar spectrum.
Planar group III-nitrides have been investigated with respect to their photocatalytical properties6–12 and it has been shown that nanostructured anode materials, namely InGaN nanowires (NWs), can further enhance the solar-to-hydrogen conversion due a larger active surface area.13–16 Molecular beam epitaxy makes it possible to grow such NWs with high aspect ratio, high crystal quality, and low defect density in precisely designed structures.17
However, InGaN NW photoelectrodes suffer from a high loss of photo-generated carriers due to non-radiative surface recombination. A method to suppress such recombination processes is to improve the passivation of surface states by deposition of ultra-thin films.18,19 Moreover, such surface coatings can have several additional effects on the lifetime and efficiency of a photoanode, depending on material parameters such as chemical composition, material quality or coating thickness. TiO2 has been shown to be an excellent protection layer for different types of (nanostructured) photoanodes.20–31
In this work we show that the performance of InGaN/GaN NW photoanodes under visible light excitation is significantly enhanced by deposition of an ultra-thin TiO2 coating. The requirements for a good passivation layer are assessed by comparison of TiO2, CeO2 and Al2O3 as coating materials. We systematically investigate the different contributions of loss processes to the photoelectrochemical performance of coated InGaN/GaN NW photoanodes, and the influence of the coating thicknesses.
Since photoexcitation of the InGaN at energies smaller than the band gaps of the coatings is possible and the band edge positions of the coatings straddle the redox levels for water splitting, an efficient charge transfer from the InGaN core to the coating material allows the realization of a coated photoanode with visible light excitation in the InGaN core.
Results and discussion
Sample properties
The investigated samples consist of InGaN/GaN NWs (cf. scanning electron microscopy image (SEM) and schematic structure in Fig. 1a), which were coated with 2–15 nm thin films of TiO2, CeO2 and Al2O3 respectively using atomic layer deposition (ALD) (cf. high resolution transmission electron images (HRTEM) and schematic structure in Fig. 1b). All NW samples show complete conformal coverages with homogeneous film thickness. Upon film deposition the shape of the nanowire remains unchanged, only the diameter is increased by twice the film thickness, resulting also in a decrease in average distance between the nanowires of the ensemble. Nevertheless, the nanowires remain sufficiently separated to allow free access of the electrolyte to their lateral facets.

For photoexcitation of carriers in the InGaN part of the NWs a wavelength of 405 nm was used. In Fig. 2 transmission measurements of 5 nm thin ALD films of the three coating materials deposited on quartz glass are shown. At 405 nm all coating materials are almost completely transparent (T405 nm,Al2O3 = 99%; T405 nm,TiO2 = 98%; T405 nm,CeO2 = 97%). Hence, it can be assumed that a comparable amount of carriers is excited in the InGaN part of uncoated and coated samples. Excitation of carriers in the GaN base of the NWs does not have to be considered.

Uncoated InGaN/GaN NW photoanodes
In Fig. 3a an example of a bias-dependent photocurrent (PC) measurement of an uncoated InGaN/GaN NW sample under chopped light irradiation is shown. For bias voltages more anodic than 270 mV vs. Ag/AgCl a current is observed in the illuminated intervals. This PC increases with increasing bias, leading to a PC density of 400 μA cm−2 at 900 mV. For bias voltages below 270 mV a current in the opposite direction can be observed both in illuminated and dark intervals. The bias dependence of the PC can be explained by the adjustment of the surface band bending due to the external bias.
 Fig. 3  PC measurements on uncoated InGaN/GaN NWs. (a) Bias-dependent chopped light PC measurement; (b) time-dependent PC measurement at a fixed anodic bias of 700 mV. 
To analyze the stability of the NW PC, repeated PC measurements at a fixed anodic bias of 700 mV for illumination intervals of 30 min separated by dark intervals of 10 min were performed (Fig. 3b). The bias of 700 mV was chosen as it results in a stable photocurrent without degradation of the NWs or the respective coatings. In the transient measurement a decrease in PC over time is observed which stabilizes after approximately 1 h, id est after 1–2 illumination intervals, at a lower PC than the initial one (dotted red line in Fig. 3b).
The application of an anodic bias to InGaN in electrolytes under illumination is known to cause oxidation of the NWs. The formation of an (InxGa1−x)2O3 layer causes a large band offset at the InxGa1−xN/(InxGa1−x)2O3 interface and a suppression of carrier transfer into the electrolyte, which leads to the permanent decrease of the PC32 (red dotted line in Fig. 3b). Once the oxide film is closed no further oxidation of the InGaN occurs and a stable PC of the InGaN NW electrodes is observed. The overshoot at the beginning of each illuminated interval (Fig. 3b) is typical for immediate transport of surface near carriers into the electrolyte after first light excitation, the decay is caused by the recombination and trapping of following carriers.
Influence of 5 nm oxide coatings
The PC of InGaN/GaN NWs coated with 5 nm thin films of TiO2, CeO2 or Al2O3 was analyzed in comparison to an uncoated reference sample (Fig. 4) at a fixed anodic bias of 700 mV using the same measurement sequence as above. For each of the measurements the second illuminated interval is shown, to discuss the transients in their stable condition where no further anodic oxidation occurs.
 Fig. 4  Influence of different ALD coatings on the PC of InGaN/GaN NWs: PC measurements of TiO2-, CeO2- and Al2O3-coated NWs at fixed 700 mV anodic bias normalized to the PC after 90 min of an uncoated reference piece (black) of the same sample are shown. 
All coated samples still show significant PCs. However, the influence of the coating strongly depends on the coating material. In comparison to the reference sample an increase of PC intensity by a factor of 2.5 after deposition of 5 nm TiO2 is observed (Fig. 4a). In contrast, CeO2 and Al2O3 coverages with the same thickness lead to a PC decrease by a factor of 0.9 (Fig. 4b and c), despite the fact that a passivation of surface states would be expected for all three materials.
To elucidate the origin for the different influence of the three coating materials on the PC, we investigated the transport of photo-excited carriers through the coating layer.
The magnitude of PC, given by the amount of electrons transported through the back contact of the NW sample into the current circuit, is mainly determined by the transfer of minority carriers, i.e. photo-generated holes into the electrolyte. After excitation in the InGaN part of the NW they can undergo different recombination processes on their way into the electrolyte, schematically shown in Fig. 5 for uncoated and coated samples.
 Fig. 5  The reduction of hole transfer (red arrow) due to different recombination processes (green arrows) is schematically shown for uncoated (left) and coated (right) InGaN/GaN NWs. Loss processes: 1/1′ radiative recombination within InGaN core (same process but possible different recombination rates), 2/2′ recombination at the InGaN surface, 3 recombination in the coating, 4 surface recombination at the coating/electrolyte interface. 
In the case of uncoated NWs the hole transfer is mainly reduced by radiative recombination in the InGaN core (process 1) and by non-radiative surface recombination (process 2).33 For coated NWs both mechanisms can be affected by the formation of the InGaN NW/oxide interface (process 1′, 2′). Moreover, defect recombination within the ultra-thin coating layer (process 3) and surface recombination at the oxide/electrolyte interface (process 4) result in further losses. Radiative recombination in the coating can be neglected, as no band-to-band excitation within the coating takes place and the simultaneous transfer of electrons and holes from the InGaN is suppressed due to band discontinuities.
To result in an enhanced PC the reduction of the recombination rate due to passivation of surface states (process 2 → process 2′) must overcompensate the additional loss processes 3 and 4. In the following, the 4 processes are investigated separately for the different coating materials.
Process 1 (resp. 1′) in Fig. 5 is the radiative recombination of excited electrons and holes in the InGaN NW and can be measured by photoluminescence (PL) measurements, which can be carried out simultaneously with the PC analysis. The PL spectra of the coated samples normalized to their uncoated reference samples at 700 mV anodic bias are compared in Fig. 6a–c. The broad shape of the PL peak varies from sample to sample as a result of an inhomogeneous In-distribution in the InGaN nanowires. Axial34–36 and radial37 variations in the In-distribution in the single nanowires as well as wire-to-wire fluctuations in nanowires ensembles38 are reported and discussed in literature. However, the peak shape in not affected by the coating and only the PL intensities in the experiments are presented here. The influence of the ALD coatings on the PL intensity depends on the respective material: whereas the PL intensity of InGaN NWs is slightly reduced by a TiO2 coating (×0.8) it remains almost constant for the CeO2 coating, while a strong enhancement is found for the Al2O3 coating (×1.6). Hence, the suppressed PC due to Al2O3 coating is accompanied by an enhancement of radiative recombination, demonstrating that these are competing processes. This is supported by the data for the TiO2 coating, where an increased PC and a decreased PL intensity are observed.
 Fig. 6  (a–c) PL spectra of TiO2-, CeO2- and Al2O3-coated NWs normalized to the spectra of uncoated reference pieces from the same sample. Spectra are taken at 700 mV anodic bias. (d) Band alignment of the coating materials compared to InxGa1−xN with an In-concentration of x = 0.25 from PL measurement (solid lines) and x = 0.1 from XRD measurement (dotted lines); the reduced band gap for amorphous Al2O2 is indicated in grey. Band position values for T = 0 K.4,5,39–42 
The proportion of PL and PC as competitive processes is mainly given by the degree of charge separation, which is defined by the InGaN/coating interface and therefore by the band bending and the band offset.
The band bending can be controlled by the applied bias, causing an opposite bias dependence for the PL and PC of uncoated, TiO2-coated and CeO2-coated samples. However, in the case of Al2O3 almost no bias dependence was observed for PL and PC (see ESI: Fig. S1†) indicating that carriers are not transferred across the InGaN/Al2O3 interface by band transfer.
Literature values for the band alignment of the different involved materials are compared in Fig. 6d.4,5,39–42 The conduction band positions of CeO2 and InGaN material with an indium concentration of 25% (extracted from PL analysis) are on the same potential and the conduction band of TiO2 is even energetically below that of InGaN (0.2 eV). The valence band positions of CeO2 and TiO2 are slightly below those of the In0.25Ga0.75N (TiO2: 0.8 eV; CeO2: 0.6 eV). For photo-generated holes this implies the formation of a small potential barrier that can easily be overcome upon illumination. If the average In-content of 10% estimated by XRD analysis is taken into account (see dotted lines in Fig. 6d), the InGaN band gap would be larger, resulting in 0.1 eV smaller valence band offsets for all materials. On the contrary, the valence (conduction) band offset between In0.25Ga0.75N and Al2O3, is 3.3 eV (3.0 eV). However, it is reported that the band gap of Al2O3 is strongly dependent on the crystallinity and reduced for amorphous Al2O3.43 From the performed transmission measurement (Fig. 2), where no indication for a decreasing transmission was observed in the entire measurement regime down to 210 nm, it can be concluded that the band gap is at least 6.2 eV (see grey shaded area in Fig. 6d). Thus, the valence band offset is still large enough to attenuate hole transfer in this case. Hence, only defect-assisted transport or tunneling of photo-generated holes into the Al2O3 coating is possible while otherwise the carrier confinement in the InGaN core is significantly enhanced, leading to an increased radiative recombination rate inside the NW. The assumption of suppressed band transfer for Al2O3-coated InGaN NWs is supported by the fact that PL and PC are independent of the applied bias in this case. Since for a 10 nm Al2O3 coating no PC was observed (see ESI: Fig. S2†), and no evidence of pin holes was found in the HR-TEM images, it can be assumed that the hole transfer in this case is most likely caused by tunneling through the rough (4.6 ± 1.6 nm) Al2O3 film.
PL intensity and band alignment are comparable for TiO2 and CeO2 coatings on InGaN NWs. However, a significant increase of the PC was observed for the TiO2 coating while a decrease was found for the CeO2 coating, suggesting non-radiative recombination in the CeO2 coating (process 3 in Fig. 5), most likely at structural defects. This conclusion is supported by HRTEM analysis of the TiO2 and CeO2 layers, shown in Fig. 7.

The TiO2 layer consists of an amorphous matrix of 5.5 nm thickness with embedded crystalline grains that have a diameter of approximately 7.5 nm. In contrast, the CeO2 film is polycrystalline, showing differently orientated grains with a grain-size equal to the film thickness and large-angle grain boundaries. The Al2O3 film is amorphous.
As CeO2 is known for its high defect ratio due to oxygen vacancies and Ce3+ defects,44 the Ce oxidation state was estimated by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements (see ESI: Fig. S3†), showing a high degree of Ce3+ sites, especially at the surface. Both, the large angle grain boundaries and the oxygen vacancies/Ce3+ sites could give rise to an enhanced defect recombination rate in the CeO2 coating compared to the TiO2 film.
The surface recombination of photo-generated holes as minority carriers with electrons in surface states (process 4 in Fig. 5) was investigated for all different coating materials. For this purpose, the PC was measured in the presence of Na2SO3 that was added as a hole scavenger (hs) to the electrolyte solution. As such, it suppresses surface recombination by fast trapping of photo-generated holes before they undergo non-radiative surface recombination. The effect of the hs on the PC was comparatively analyzed for all samples including the reference. In Fig. 8 the PCs measured in the presence of the hs, with respect to a PC measured without hs on the same sample are shown. The magnitude of this ratio is a measure for the surface recombination velocity of the respective sample without hs.
 Fig. 8  Influence of the presence of Na2SO3 as hole scavenger (hs) in the electrolyte. PC measurements at 700 mV anodic bias are shown for uncoated, TiO2-, CeO2- and Al2O3-coated InGaN/GaN NWs, each sample measured without (dashed) and with hs. All measurements are normalized to the respective measurement without hs. Arrows indicate the increase of PC caused by the addition of hs. 
For the bare InGaN/GaN NWs the PC is increased by a factor of 52 when the hs is added to the electrolyte, while the influence is much lower for samples with 5 nm thin films of the different oxides (+TiO2: ×12; +CeO2: ×29; +Al2O3: ×31). Note that only the effect of hs on a specific sample is investigated. Also in this experiment TiO2-coated samples show a higher total PC than Al2O3-coated and CeO2-coated ones. Consequently, for the TiO2-coated samples the surface recombination is lowest and reduced by a factor of 5 compared to the uncoated reference. These results show that the reduction of surface recombination velocity is an important contribution to the enhancement of the PC of oxide coated InGaN/GaN NWs.
Comparing the three different oxide coatings, the results above show that only for TiO2 the reduced surface recombination velocity overcompensates the additional loss processes induced by the oxide film, thereby leading to a significant enhancement of the PC. For the CeO2-coated samples, the additional loss processes in the coating are dominant while the huge band discontinuities suppress a transfer of photo-generated carriers in the case of Al2O3 coating.
The presence of the hs has also impact on the bias-dependence of PC and PL. In Fig. 9 this is exemplarily shown for the sample coated with a 5 nm TiO2 film. Fig. 9a demonstrates that the main influence of the hole scavenger on the PC is a shift of the onset potential (minimum potential to observe a PC) to the cathodic direction. This indicates that the open circuit potential (OCP) is also shifted (measured OCPs are marked by vertical lines: −330 mV → −605 mV) and therefore a higher carrier separation, e.g. higher PC at a given potential is gained.
 Fig. 9  Influence of hs on the bias dependent PC and PL – example of a 5 nm TiO2-coated sample. (a) Bias dependent PC measurements in electrolyte with and without hs. The hs shifts the open circuit potential (indicated by the arrow and vertical lines) leading to a PC increase. Excitation wavelength was 523 nm. (b) Bias dependent PL measurements in electrolyte with and without hs. Insets show the PL-spectra at −700 mV resp. +700 mV; biases are marked by coloured circles on the curves. Excitation wavelength was 405 nm. 
The shift of OCP can be explained by an enhanced occupation of electron surface states in the presence of the hs, since the recombination with photo-generated holes is suppressed.
In Fig. 9b the influence of an hs on the bias-dependent PL intensity is shown. In this case two effects of the hs are observed: a general offset to lower PL intensities and a shift in the direction of cathodic bias. The latter is a consequence of decreasing OCP, leading to strongly reduced PL intensities only in the cathodic regime. In the anodic regime however, only a small decrease of PL intensity is observed as the curves are already in saturation.
Influence of coating thickness
The carrier recombination in the TiO2 coating was further investigated by analyzing the evolution of the PC with the thickness of the coating (2, 5, 7, 10 and 15 nm). Al2O3 and CeO2 coatings did not result in any PC enhancement even for coatings as low as 2 nm and are therefore not further investigated. In Fig. 10a the resulting dependence of the PC on the thickness is shown. At t = 0 the resulting PC increases with decreasing coating thickness, where a 2 and 5 nm coating lead to an increase and a 7–15 nm coating lead to a decrease of PC compared to the uncoated reference sample. This trend can be attributed to an enhancement of defect recombination in the coating for increased layer thickness (process 3 in Fig. 5).

However, the transient PC behavior strongly depends on the coating thickness: for coatings <7 nm a degradation of the PC with time is observed. The intensity loss is highest for the uncoated reference and the 2 nm coated sample and less pronounced for the sample with a 5 nm TiO2 coating. Films with coatings ≥7 nm show very stable PCs in contrast. We attribute the permanent degradation to the anodic oxidation of the InGaN for the thin coatings, while the thicker coatings serve as protection layer. The observed differences in long term stability lead to the fact that after some measurement time even NWs with TiO2 coatings of ≥7 nm lead to increased PCs compared to the uncoated sample. Therefore, a coating of 5–7 nm is regarded as the best compromise between long term stability and PC enhancement.
Measurements in hs (Fig. 10b) again result in a strong increase of PC for the reference and the 2–5 nm TiO2-coated samples, coatings of 7–10 nm show almost the same PC as without hs. When the hs is added to the electrolyte the anodic oxidation is suppressed and therefore the PC is stable for all samples.
Conclusions
The influence of ultra-thin TiO2, CeO2 and Al2O3 coatings on the photoelectrochemical performance of InGaN NWs on GaN NW templates was comparatively analyzed. All investigated coating materials were deposited by ALD. They are transparent for the investigated excitation wavelength of 405 nm and their band edge positions straddle the redox levels for water splitting.
It was demonstrated that the presence of a 5 nm TiO2 coating enhances the anodic PC of uncoated InGaN/GaN NWs by a factor of 2.5, which is attributed to the passivation of surface states.
In contrast, for 5 nm coatings with CeO2 or Al2O3 the passivation of surface states could also be proved by analysis in hole scavenger electrolyte, but did not lead to an enhancement of the PC, as other recombination processes were enhanced. For Al2O3, the high band offset to InGaN suppresses the transfer of photocarriers and results in an enhancement of radiative recombination. In the case of CeO2 additional carrier losses are introduced by increased defect recombination in the layer.
While an enhancement of the PC was observed for TiO2 coatings with thicknesses of 2 nm and 5 nm, an increased thickness of 7 nm to 15 nm results in a decrease of the PC due to recombination in the coating.
For longer operation times the anodic PC of uncoated InGaN/GaN NWs stabilizes on a decreased level as a consequence of photoanodic oxidation. While this degradation effect is reduced for a coating thickness up to 5 nm it is completely suppressed for a thickness of 7 nm and more.
Consequently, ultra-thin TiO2 coatings with a thickness of 5 nm and 7 nm provide a stable enhancement of the photocurrent of InGaN/GaN NWs for photoelectrochemical application. In addition, due to efficient transfer of photocarriers, the resulting composite nanostructures consisting of a photoactive InGaN core and a functional TiO2 coating provide the possibility of triggering photochemical reactions at the TiO2 surface with sub-bandgap excitation.
Experimental section
MBE growth of InGaN/GaN NWs
InxGa1−xN/GaN NW heterostructures were grown on n-type Si(111) substrates (As-doped, ρ < 0.01 Ω cm) by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) using a self-assembled growth process under nitrogen rich conditions.45 They have a diameter of approximately 50–80 nm and a density of approx. 100 NW μm−2, both estimated from SEM top view images, and consist of a GaN base with a length of 350 nm (for Al2O3 coating and reference) resp. 600 nm (for TiO2, CeO2 coating and references) and an InxGa1−xN top section with a length of 300–350 nm (estimated from growth rates taken from pure GaN NW growth for the GaN base and TEM-images for the InGaN). From the position of the photoluminescence emission, a band gap of 2.3–2.6 eV (530–480 nm) was estimated for the InxGa1−xN at room temperature. Using the room temperature band gap values EGaNgap = 3.44 eV, EInNgap = 0.76 eV and b = 1.4 eV (ref. 39) this results in an In content of x = 0.22–0.31. However, the In content determined from XRD measurements is 0.1, indicating an inhomogeneous In distribution and preferential recombination in In-rich regions.
Atomic layer deposition of oxide films
The NWs were coated with thin films of CeO2, TiO2 and Al2O3 with different layer thickness using ALD. Uncoated reference pieces for each sample were comparatively analyzed.
For ALD of CeO2 Ce(thd)4 and ozone were used as precursors at a deposition temperature of 270 °C.46 400 ALD-cycles were used for a nominal film thickness of 5 nm (HRTEM: 5.8 ± 0.7 nm). The deposition of CeO2 was verified by EELS analysis. The size of the indirect band gap was estimated from a Tauc plot obtained by transmission measurements of a 5 nm CeO2 film on quartz glass as reference and is about 2.9 eV (see ESI: Fig. S4†) (Lit: 3.2 eV (ref. 40)).
ALD of TiO2 films was carried out at a temperature of 200 °C using TiCl4 and water as precursors. 60, 150, 210, 300 and 450 cycles were used to gain nominally 2, 5, 7, 10 and 15 nm thin films (HRTEM of 2, 5 and 10 nm film: 2.2 ± 0.3 nm, 4.9 nm with grains of up to 8 nm included; 9.0 ± 1.5 nm). EELS measurements showed the deposition of TiO2 and the HRTEM confirmed that the crystal phase was the tetragonal anatase. From transmission measurements on a 5 nm TiO2 film on quartz glass as a reference an indirect band gap of 3.1 eV was determined from Tauc plot (see ESI: Fig. S4†) (Lit.: 3.2 eV (ref. 41)).
Al2O3 coatings were deposited at a substrate temperature of 250 °C using trimethylaluminium (TMA) and water as precursors. 55 cycles were used for a nominal film thickness of 5 nm (HRTEM: 4.6 ± 1.6 nm). The deposition of Al2O3 on a reference planar film of the same film thickness on a silicon substrate was verified by XPS. The Al2O3 was optically transparent in the entire experimentally accessible wavelength range.

TEM characterization. 
High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), high angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning TEM (STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectrum imaging (SI) were performed using a TECNAI F20 field emission gun microscope operated at 200 kV with a point to point resolution of 0.14 nm. The atomic resolution HAADF-STEM images were acquired on a probe corrected FEI Titan 60–300 equipped with a high brightness field emission gun (XFEG) and a CETCOR corrector from CEOS to produce a probe size below 1 Å. The microscope was operated at 300 kV, with a convergence angle of 25 mrad and an inner collection angle of the detector of 58 mrad. For the cross-section aberration corrected HAADF-STEM micrograph image in Fig. 7b the wires were removed from the Si substrate, suspended in isopropanol and aligned by dielectrophoreses on a chip with conducting tracks on it. A lamella transversal to the aligned wires was cut by a focused ion beam (FIB).

Photoelectrochemical investigation
For photoelectrochemical investigation (photoluminescence, photocurrent and open circuit potential measurements) the sample was mounted in a cell with a continuous electrolyte flow, realized by a peristaltic pump.
As standard electrolyte a 1 M phosphate buffer solution at pH 8 with a conductivity of 100 mS cm−1 was used. For a hole scavenger containing electrolyte, 1 M of Na2SO3 was added to the solution. A pH-value of 8 and a conductivity of 100 mS cm−1 were adjusted for comparability.
An external bias was applied by connecting the sample as working electrode in a three-electrode setup with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum counter electrode. Ohmic contacts on the backside of the conductive silicon substrates were deposited by thermal evaporation of 50 nm Al and 150 nm Ag. A potentiostat was used to apply a controlled bias.
For photo-excitation of the NW structures a 405 nm laser diode was fiber-coupled to the chamber through a quartz window on top. The incident excitation power was determined to 29 mW using a power meter.
For photoluminescence (PL) measurements the light emitted by the NW sample is fiber-coupled to a QWave USB spectrometer (rgb lasersystems). Two pass filters at 435 and 425 nm were used to suppress the laser line.
Simultaneous measurement of the photocurrent (PC) was facilitated using a Keithley 2700 multimeter connected between potentiostat and working electrode. A shutter was placed in front of the laser diode, to make a switching between dark and illuminated intervals in transient measurements possible.
The open circuit potential was measured after an equilibration time of 20 min in dark and after 5 min under illumination, respectively.
The chopped light voltammetry analyses shown in Fig. 9 was performed in a photoelectrochemistry setup by Zahner (Zennium), using a 523 nm LED (0.7 mW excitation power on the sample) for excitation and a static 3-electrode measurement cell without electrolyte flow.
All measurements were performed at room temperature.
