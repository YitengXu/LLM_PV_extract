    , Accepted 6th March 2016First published on 8th March 2016AbstractThere is widespread interest in finding sustainable replacements for fossil fuels, and hence hydrogen production via water splitting has received much attention. However, finding efficient water splitting methods remains a challenge. We use first principles theory to design a catalytic cycle for water splitting that employs the pyroelectric effect in ferroelectrics. Taking PbTiO3 as an example, we show that actively controlling the ferroelectric polarization via cyclic temperature modulations can catalyze the splitting of H2O into O2 and H2. In practice, the energy needed to drive this cycle may be provided by low/intermediate grade heat. Since no precious metals are used in this catalytic cycle, this approach may lead to viable water-splitting methods that employ earth-abundant elements.
Introduction
The increasing demand for renewable energy sources is a prominent challenge of the 21st century.1–5 Since the industrial revolution, the main energy sources for industrial societies have been fossil fuels. The resultant carbon emission has had significant effects on the environment.6–9 Thus, departure from carbon-based to sustainable energy sources is deemed desirable. One scenario is to harvest solar, geothermal or wasted industrial energy and to store it in the chemical bonds of molecules such as H2 for later use as fuel.1,2,10–13 Hydrogen has a high energy density, zero carbon emission when burned, and can be used in fuel cells to produce electricity.14,15 These factors make hydrogen a prominent candidate for a future energy carrier.16,17 Additionally, hydrogen is a critical component of important industrial and chemical processes including ammonia and methanol synthesis.18–21 Unfortunately, an efficient and economically viable method for green production of hydrogen is lacking.22,23 At present, hydrogen is produced primarily by processing fossil fuels: e.g., oil or natural gas reforming and coal gasification.4,24,25 Here, we describe the possibility of exploiting the pyroelectric properties of ferroelectrics26 to design a catalytic cycle that enables water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen using low/intermediate grade heat. We note that harvesting waste heat and turning it into electrical power via the pyroelectric effect in ferroelectrics and cyclic temperature modulations (the Olsen or Ericsson cycle)27–34 is an active research area. In this work, for the first time, we exploit the pyroelectric effect of ferroelectric oxides to propose a catalytic cycle that harvests waste heat and stores its energy in chemical bonds of H2 molecules. Unlike the Olsen cycle, our cycle does not require an external electric field.35
Although our work is computational, there is indirect experimental evidence suggesting that our proposal may work in practice: (a) it is possible to harness vibrational energy to split water using piezoelectric ZnO fibers and BaTiO3 dendrites based on what has been termed as a piezoelectrochemical (PZEC) effect,36 (b) pyroelectricity in ferroelectrics can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in water, a pyroelectrocatalytic effect; these species cannot be used for energy storage (due to their extreme instability), but can be used for water disinfection.37,38 Hence, vibrational energy or heat can be transformed into chemical energy by dissociating water molecules.
Since the 1950s, the catalytic properties of ferroelectrics have been studied experimentally.39–44 For example, the internal fields resulting from the surface polarization and surface charges of ferroelectrics improve electron–hole separation and lead to polarization-dependent and enhanced photocatalysis.33,45–54 Separately, ferroelectric polarization can affect molecular adsorption onto and desorption from surfaces.40,55–60 Ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials also have been exploited in turning abundant waste vibrational energy (e.g., from cars, trains or engines in general) into electricity61,62 using piezoelectric nanogenerators.63–67 In tandem with experimental studies, the continued development of computational methods and facilities has made ab initio studies of ferroelectric surface chemistry possible.68–74 Recently, using density functional theory (DFT)75,76 it has been shown that by employing ferroelectric polarization in a cyclic manner (i.e., switching between the two opposite out-of-plane polarization directions), one can overcome some of the fundamental limitations on catalytic efficiency imposed by the Sabatier principle44,77 and catalyze reactions that are challenging for more conventional catalysts: e.g., NOx direct decomposition to N2 and O2.78 In such a scheme, one cycles the surface between multiple states with very different interaction strengths: adsorption and desorption do not have to be competing effects (as per the Sabatier principle79,80 for fixed surfaces) but both can be cyclically enhanced or suppressed to drive the desired set of reactions or adsorption/desorption processes in sequence.44,78
In the previous work on NOx direct decomposition, the surface system consisted of a monolayer of active transition metal (e.g., CrO2 or RuO2) on ferroelectric PbTiO3.78 In this work, we consider a simpler system that is easier to fabricate and study experimentally: the (001) surface of bare ferroelectric PbTiO3. We describe a temperature-driven catalytic cycle which uses the pyroelectric effect81–86 to modify the ferroelectric polarization in a cyclic manner. This creates a process that can effectively split H2O into H2 and O2. Another benefit of the current process is that we do not need external electric field modulation to cycle the polarization but can use temperature modulation instead. In practice, the thermal energy needed to drive this cycle may be provided by geothermal,87,88 industrial waste heat,82,89–94 or concentrated solar95–97 power: the Curie temperature (Tc)98 of common ferroelectric perovskites (e.g., PbZrxTi1−xO3 or BaTiO3 solid solutions) can be tuned99–104 in the accessible range of 100–450 °C.99,104–106
Our study fills a missing link in a chain of phenomena that share a fundamental underlying theme of converting some form of waste energy (heat or vibration) into a more useful form (electricity or chemical energy) using polarization modulation. These phenomena include the Olsen cycle,29,82,91 piezoelectrochemistry,36,107–114 pyroelectrocatalysis37,38 and piezoelectric nanogenerators.62,63,115–127 In this work, using ab initio DFT calculations, we connect the polarization modulation to the microscopic structure of the polarization-dependent surface phases and identify the driving forces behind the energy conversion.
Computational methods
We perform DFT calculations75,76 with plane-wave basis sets using the Quantum Espresso software128 together with ultrasoft pseudopotentials.129–131 A slab geometry with (001) surface normal and polarization axis is employed.78,132 We introduce at least 15 Å of vacuum to isolate periodic copies of the slabs. A dipole correction in the center of the vacuum is used in order to eliminate the artificial electrical field and the unphysical dipole–dipole interactions among the copies of the slab in the z direction.133 The plane-wave energy cutoff is 30 Ry. The k-sampling density of the Brillouin zone is 8 × 8 for a 1 × 1 primitive surface unit cell. The Kohn–Sham states' occupations are smeared using the cold smearing method of Marzari and Vanderbilt with a smearing width of 5 mRy/kB.134 The convergence criterion on forces is that all components of all forces must be smaller than 1 × 10−3 (a.u.). The convergence threshold on stress for variable cell calculations is 0.5 kBar. In each ionic relaxation step, the energy convergence threshold for self-consistency is 1 × 10−6 Ry (in the final steps, close to the energy minimum, this value is automatically reduced by a factor of 100). These convergence parameters yield binding energies to better than 0.1 eV precision. We use a standard method whereby a few layers of Pt are placed on the bottom PbTiO3 surface to create an electrode with a large density of states at the Fermi level which simulates an electron reservoir that exists in realistic systems of thick ferroelectric films.71,78,132,135,136 The energies reported here are obtained using the GGA-PW91 exchange–correlation (XC) functional.137,138 However, the main findings are checked to be independent of the specific choice of XC functional: more information on the choice of XC functional, a sample unit cell and other computational details are available in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
Atomic and electronic reconstructions on ferroelectric surfaces
Ferroelectric materials (e.g., PbTiO3) possess a switchable bulk electrical polarization vector  that couples to temperature (pyroelectricity),140 strain,141–143 external magnetic78,144,145 and electric fields.146,147 When  has a non-zero component along the surface normal , so that · ≠ 0, one has a polar surface.148,149 If the surface polarization were uncompensated, a constant electric field would develop in the material that would contribute an energy cost growing linearly with the material thickness which is untenable for thick samples. Once an equal amount of compensating surface charge appears on the surface (with areal charge density σ = −·), the interior field is canceled. Consequently, if one controls the direction and/or magnitude of the ferroelectric polarization, the surface properties are modified due to the changing compensation.44,78,132,150,151 The simplest compensation scenario is to accumulate electrons (when · > 0) or holes (when ·n < 0) in the electronic bands of the stoichiometric surface. Fig. 1 shows an example of this for the PbO-terminated (001) stoichiometric surface of PbTiO3. This is an electronic reconstruction.152–157 In addition to the electronic reconstruction, the geometric arrangement of surface atoms may also reconstruct to further stabilize the surface: typically there is a symmetry breaking that pushes bonding states further below and anti-bonding states further above the Fermi level (EF), similar in spirit to a Peierls distortion.158–161Fig. 1(c) exemplifies this for the negatively-poled PbO-terminated PbTiO3 surface. If there is sufficient time and atomic mobility on the surface, another compensation avenue is opened: atoms (or molecules) can adsorb or desorb from the surface which is an atomic reconstruction.69,78,162–167 The change in surface stoichiometry can provide additional surface states (compared to the stoichiometric surface) that are energetically more favorable for electrons/holes to occupy.44

Right: atomically reconstructed c(2 × 2) surface with 0.5 ML O vacancies. In going from left to center, the surface breaks symmetry thereby pushing filled states lower in energy and empty (hole) states higher in energy around EF. On the right, the removal of O atoms creates high energy hole states with strong Pb 6p contributions near the conduction band edge. Part (a) and (b) are rendered using the XCrySDen software.139 
Using DFT, we compute ground state energies for a variety of surface compositions and structures as a function of the ferroelectric polarization. These energies can then be used (following the approach of ref. 132) to build the phase diagrams168–170 shown in Fig. 2 which describe the most thermodynamically stable surface phases of (001) PbTiO3 as a function of polarization and Pb and O chemical potentials. The positively polarized PbTiO3 surface prefers to have 0.5 ML of Pb vacancies, whereas the negatively poled prefers 0.5 ML of oxygen vacancies; in comparison, the non-polar paraelectric PbTiO3 surface prefers to have stoichiometric termination (in all cases, the surfaces prefer to be Pb- instead of Ti-terminated which is in agreement with the literature171–173). The densities of states plot in Fig. 1(c) explains why negatively poled PbTiO3 prefers to atomically reconstruct: when oxygen vacancies form on the surface, high energy (Pb 6p dominated) surface states appear in the spectrum, and these states happily accommodate the compensating holes, lower the total energy and lead to greater chemical stability. In addition, O vacancy formation pushes down the center of the O 2p surface valence band relative to EF by ≈ 0.45 eV which further enhances stability.78,174

The physically allowed region within which PbTiO3 is stable (against decomposition into various combinations of compounds made of Pb, Ti and O) is within the dashed trapezoid. 
Thermodynamically stable surface phases of PbTiO3 in a mixed O2 and H2O atmosphere
With the above fundamentals in mind, we examine the thermodynamics of PbTiO3 surfaces in a mixed H2O and O2 atmosphere. First, we build surface phase diagrams as a function of H2O and O2 chemical potentials. As shown in Fig. 3, under easily accessible ranges of chemical potentials (−1 eV ≤ μH2O, μO ≤ 0 eV), i.e., pressures above 10−4 atm and temperatures below 450 °C,175 the thermodynamically stable surface of (i) negatively poled PbTiO3 is covered with 1 ML of H chemisorbed to surface O atoms forming OH−, (ii) the paraelectric surface remains stoichiometric with possible weak physisorption of H2O and O2, and (iii) positively poled PbTiO3 is covered with 1 ML OH which is chemisorbed to the surface Pb forming OH−.
 Fig. 3  Polarization-dependent surface phase diagrams of Pb-terminated (001) PbTiO3 surfaces as a function of H2O and O chemical potentials μH2O and μO. Each colored and labeled region represents the most stable thermodynamic surface phase. In the most relevant range of chemical potentials (−1 eV ≤ μH2O, μO ≤ 0 eV), the negatively-poled surface prefers to be covered with 1 ML of H, the paraelectric surface prefers to be stoichiometric, and the positively-poled surface has 1 ML OH. 
These findings are readily understood based on charge counting and the fact that the magnitude || of the bulk polarization of PbTiO3 corresponds to ≈1 fundamental unit of charge per primitive 1 × 1 surface unit cell (s.u.c.).78,176,177 Within an ionic picture, each PbO plane in the bulk-like regions of PbTiO3 consists of Pb2+ cations and O2− anions. The stoichiometric negatively-poled surface is compensated by ≈1 hole per s.u.c. that resides primarily in the O 2p surface states of oxygen anions (making them O−): having one H bound to each surface O anion leads to the formation of 1 ML OH− and the hole happily moves to the H 1s dominated anti-bonding state of the O–H bond. For the stoichiometric positively-poled surface, the compensating electron resides mainly in the Pb 6p states of Pb cations (making them Pb+): when an OH binds to each surface Pb cation, the electron favorably fills the low-energy available bonding state of the OH to form OH− (and the Pb becomes Pb2+ again). The stoichiometric paraelectric surface is insulating, has no excess holes or electrons, and lacks any interest in forming chemical bonds.
Water splitting by cyclic polarization modulation
These surface phase diagrams can be used to design a cyclic catalytic pathway for water splitting. As exemplified by recent work on NOx direct decomposition,78 by cyclically switching the ferroelectric polarization, one can leverage the differences in preferred thermodynamic surface phases of the different polarizations to drive forth desired reactions. In the present case, cycling between the paraelectric and negative surfaces suggests the following intriguing scenario. Starting with the negatively poled surface, it quickly reconstructs to form 0.5 ML of O vacancies (which is the thermodynamic ground state in the absence of H2O molecules). Next, 0.5 ML H2O will readily dissociate to form chemisorbed H and OH (with the OH filling the 0.5 ML O vacancies) leading to a surface covered with atomic H (the thermodynamic ground state for negative polarization in a mixed O2 and H2O atmosphere). When the ferroelectric enters the paraelectric phase (e.g., via an increase in temperature), the H atoms can recombine to form H2 which will then desorb to leave a pristine stoichiometric surface (the preferred state for the paraelectric case). This cycle can then be repeated.
We verify the feasibility of this scenario by computing key energy barriers via the nudged elastic band (NEB)178–181 and constrained relaxation182,183 methods. The barriers turn out to be favorable, and the cycle and its energy landscape are depicted in Fig. 4. We now explain the key labeled steps I–X. We begin in step I with a pristine negatively-poled surface compensated by ≈1 hole per s.u.c. The surface prefers to atomically reconstruct (steps II–III) whereby half of the surface O combine to form weakly bound O2 molecules that leave the surface. The energy barrier for this process is only 0.4 eV per O2 molecule so the surface should atomically reconstruct rapidly to its preferred 0.5 ML vacancy structure, especially since no molecular binding or dissociation is required.132 However, once H2O molecules are present and adsorb, the system prefers a new thermodynamic state. We find that the H2O molecules dissociate into bound H and OH barrierlessly on this vacancy rich surface (steps III–V): the surface ends up with 1 ML H chemisorbed on a stoichiometric PbO layer (see Fig. 5). The surface is now passivated by the strongly bound H atoms and is chemically inactive.
 Fig. 4  Water splitting (2H2O → O2 + 2H2) by cyclic switching between the negatively-poled and paraelectric surfaces of (001) PbTiO3. (a) Depicts the cycle. In brief, two H2O molecules are dissociated on negatively poled surface to produce bound atomic H; when the surface is switched to the paraelectric phase, the H atoms recombine to form weakly bound H2 making for a pristine surface ready for the next cycle. See the text for further details. (b) Shows the energy landscape for the cycle and includes meta-stable states (solid line segments) and transition states (circles connected by dotted lines). The oxygen formation barrier (between step I and II) is 0.4 eV, and the hydrogen formation energy (between step VI and VII, and also step VIII and IX) is 0.3 eV. 
 Fig. 5  Key structures during (a and b) H2O dissociation on the vacancy rich (0.5 ML O vacancy) negatively-poled PbTiO3 (001) surface and (b and c) H2 production on paraelectric surface. Grey balls are Pb, fuchsia balls are O, green balls are H, and blue Ti balls are encaged in the blue octahedra formed by the O. Each surface O vacancy makes for an octahedron with missing apex in (a). In (a), H2O molecules are above the negatively-poled surface. Each water molecule splits into H and OH barrierlessly: the H binds to the surface O and the OH fills the O vacancy to produce the thermodynamic ground state in (b) sporting 1 ML chemisorbed H. (c) Shows the ground state of the paraelectric surface: the H atoms from (b) form H2 molecules with a small barrier of 0.3 eV and are weakly physisorbed to this stoichiometric surface. This figure is rendered using VESTA.184 
Next, we move the system to the paraelectric phase (e.g., by increasing the temperature above the Curie temperature Tc of the ferroelectric). Now, having 1 ML of H on the surface (step VI) is far from the ground state of the paraelectric surface: it prefers to be stoichiometric and have weakly physisorbed H2 molecules. We find a small barrier of 0.3 eV for H2 formation (steps VII–IX). Once the paraelectric surface reaches this final state (step X), it is in its ground state and chemically inert, and the H2 molecules can leave the surface easily (see Fig. 5). We can repeat this cycle anew by returning to the negatively-poled surface (steps X–I), e.g., by lowering the temperature below Tc. In short, we propose to use temperature, via the pyroelectric effect, as a switch that controls the substrate's ferroelectric order. By modulating the temperature cyclically, we periodically push the system out of equilibrium then leverage the surface's tendency to reach its thermodynamic ground state to drive desired parts of the water splitting reaction (total energies and transition barrier energies for the various steps in the cycle are tabulated in the ESI†).
As mentioned by Kalinin et al.,185 when the polarization screening on ferroelectric surfaces is due to charged adsorbates, the relaxation (desorption) of these charges may be a slow process. Luckily, in our system, we expect the relaxation to be rapid: e.g., when the surface covered by 1 ML H is switched from negative to paraelectric phase, the H2 formation barrier is quite small at 0.3 eV and the H2 molecules are only weakly physisorbed. Nevertheless, future experiments will be needed to measure the actual relaxation rates.
We note that, in principle, an alternative pathway for the negatively polarized surface to reach its most stable thermodynamic state (1 ML H chemisorbed) is to dissociate H2 molecules on the stoichiometric surface. The H2 dissociation barrier is calculated to be 0.6 eV on this surface, which is higher than 0.4 eV barrier for O2 formation (which creates 0.5 ML oxygen vacancy on the surface) and 0.0 eV barrier for H2O dissociation (on the surface with 0.5 ML oxygen vacancies) which brings the surface to its thermodynamic ground state. Thus the preferred pathway for negatively poled surface to reach its thermodynamic ground state is via H2O dissociation as opposed to H2 dissociation. Therefore, the H2 molecules produced in this scheme in paraelectric phase do not dissociate back to atomic hydrogen on negative polarization and can be accumulated and extracted from the cycle.
Finally, a different possible pathway involves H2 molecules reducing the negatively polarized surface, forming H2O and leaving the surface with oxygen vacancies. There are examples in the literature where oxides can be reduced by dehydration, e.g., on transition metal oxide surfaces.186–189 In our case, this turns out to be both thermodynamically and kinetically prohibited. Thermodynamically, the surface phase which includes atomic H is more favorable (by 0.8 eV per H2 molecule) than H2O physisorbed on the surface with oxygen vacancies. Kinetically, this reaction requires H2 to dissociate and react with surface oxygen to form H2O which, as mentioned above has a 0.6 eV barrier per molecule that is higher than the 0.4 eV required for O2 desorption and 0.0 eV required for H2O dissociation on the oxygen deficient surface.
The effect of positively polarized domains
We note that as per Fig. 3, the positively-poled surface prefers to have 1 ML OH chemisorbed to the surface Pb. We find that the most kinetically favorable pathway for the stoichiometric positively-poled PbTiO3 surface to reach its ground state (1 ML of chemisorbed OH) is to first dissociate O2 molecules into O atoms (a barrierless process) to reach the configuration with 0.5 ML chemisorbed O, and then H2O molecules barrierlessly dissociate on this surface to bring it to its thermodynamic ground state with 1 ML chemisorbed OH. Hence, although the positively-poled surface can dissociate H2O, it is not useful for achieving the overall splitting process in our cyclic scheme: the positively poled surface is oxygen rich, and upon being switched to the paraelectric phase, water molecules reform on the surface with no net H2 production. Thus, while the positive polarization is not useful for water splitting, it does not deter it either. Therefore, our simple recommendation for experimental realization of our cycle is to create and use ferroelectric samples dominated by negatively-poled domains. However, even if the surface ends up with a domain structure190,191 having equal amounts of positive and negative polarization, half of the surface will be still active for hydrogen production (and the other half will be inert).
A separate potential concern with the positively-poled surface regards its stoichiometry. As shown in Fig. 2, if only O2 is available to the surface, the most thermodynamically favorable surface phase has 0.5 ML Pb vacancies. In contrast, the negatively polarized and paraelectric surfaces do not favor Pb vacancies. Thus, in principle, it might be possible that the presence of surface Pb vacancies will pin the polarization192 into the inert positive direction upon cooling below the Curie temperature Tc (if the Pb vacancies do not easily diffuse into the bulk). Thus, for our cyclic scheme to run at full efficiency, one should minimize the concentration of Pb vacancies on the surface. In order to guide future experiments, we build surface phase diagrams for positively poled PbTiO3 with varying H2O and O chemical potentials (i.e., for a mixed O2 and H2O atmosphere) in which we include surfaces with Pb vacancies. The Pb chemical potential can vary in the physically allowed range of −2.6 eV ≤ μPb ≤ 0 eV based on Fig. 2 (the surface phase diagram shown in Fig. 3 for the positively polarized surface was based on an intermediate value of the Pb chemical potential μPb = −1.3 eV). In Fig. 6, we show the surface phase diagrams for positively polarized surface for three different Pb chemical potential values. It can be seen that even in the extreme case of the lowest possible allowed Pb chemical potential (μPb = −2.6 eV), which most strongly favors the formation of Pb vacancies, for reasonable values of the O and H2O chemical potentials (−1 eV ≤ μH2O, μO ≤ 0 eV), the most stable thermodynamic states do not have Pb vacancies. Hence, our recommendation to experimenters is to always keep the PbTiO3 sample in a mixed H2O and O2 atmosphere with high enough partial pressures in order to prevent appearance of Pb vacancies on the surface. Vacuum conditions may be a poor choice when attempting to realize our proposed catalytic cycle for hydrogen production on PbTiO3 or other similar ferroelectrics.

Left: the lowest possible physically allowed value of −2.6 eV as per Fig. 2. Center: an intermediate Pb chemical potential of −1.3 eV. Right: the highest physically allowed value of 0 eV. Regardless of the Pb chemical potential, the top right corner of the surface phase diagrams, which corresponds to high enough and reasonable partial pressures of oxygen and water, is dominated by a surface phase that does not favor Pb vacancies. 
Operating the catalytic cycle below the Curie temperature
Up to this point, our proposed catalytic cycle relies on using the different properties of the negatively-poled and paraelectric surfaces in tandem via cyclic temperature modulation. We now explain that it is not necessary to drive the system into the fully paraelectric phase: one only needs to make the polarization magnitude small enough to change the thermodynamic ground state of the less polarized surface. Fig. 7 shows how the surface phase diagram of the negatively-poled surface depends on the out-of-plane component P of the substrate ferroelectric polarization over the wide range of −120.9 ≤ P ≤ 0 μC cm−2.
 Fig. 7  Surface phase diagrams of the negatively-poled PbTiO3 surface as a function of the (fixed) magnitude of the substrate out-of-plane polarization within the range of −120.9 ≤ Pz ≤ 0 μC cm−2. For simplicity of presentation, when creating these diagrams we have only included surface phases with chemisorbed species and have excluded surface phases that have additional weakly physisorbed molecules. 
The most negative value is determined by the exchange correlation (XC) functional we have used (GGA-PW91) which predicts a bulk polarization magnitude equal to 120.9 μC cm−2 for the tetragonal ferroelectric ground state of bulk PbTiO3 (computed via the Berry phase method193,194). In fact, the magnitude predicted by the GGA-PW91 XC functional is overestimated compared to the experimental value176,177 of ≈90 μC cm−2, so we believe the range of values considered in Fig. 7 encompasses all potentially interesting and accessible polarization magnitudes. Furthermore, for reasonable ranges of oxygen and water chemical potentials (−1 eV ≤ μH2O, μO ≤ 0 eV which correspond to temperatures below 450 °C and pressures above 10−4 atm), the stable surface phase with 1 ML H does not change for P ≤ −90 μC cm−2 so the overestimation is also of no great consequence for physical predictions.
Our key practical conclusion from the data in Fig. 7 is that one does not actually have to go above the Curie temperature (Tc) and have a fully paraelectric surface in order to “clean off” the atomic H from the surface via production of H2: as long as the polarization becomes small enough (roughly below 20 μC cm−2 in magnitude), the surface still prefers to be stoichiometric so atomic H will leave the surface in form of H2 molecules. Fig. 7 also illustrates that a hydrogen production cycle is most efficient if P ≤ −70 μC cm−2 in the low temperature part of the cycle: polarizations of −70 ≤ P ≤ −40 μC cm−2 will still dissociate water to create bound H atoms but with a lower efficiency because the preferred coverage is only 0.5 ML H (instead of 1 ML H for larger polarization magnitudes). In brief, while the maximum theoretical catalytic efficiency occurs by cycling between fully paraelectric and negatively-poled surfaces, a smaller change of polarization can be sufficient to drive the catalytic cycle, albeit with somewhat reduced efficiency, which translates into a smaller required temperature modulation.
We end this section by noting that the coupling between polarization and temperature (pyroelectricity) is only one way to cycle the ferroelectric surface between the large-magnitude and small-magnitude polarization regimes. Another avenue is to use the coupling between polarization and strain (piezoelectricity),36 or polarization and electric/magnetic fields, alone or in tandem with pyroelectricity.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we propose a catalytic cycle for water splitting in which we exploit the different electronic properties and thermodynamic ground states of the negatively-poled and paraelectric surfaces of a ferroelectric oxide. By using the pyroelectric effect, one is able to switch the ferroelectric into (and back from) its paraelectric phase by modulating the temperature near the ferroelectric Curie temperature Tc. Luckily, the Tc for workhorse ferroelectrics such as PbZrxTi1−xO3 and BaTiO3 solid solutions can be tuned in the useful range of 100–450 °C.105,106 Hence, in practice, the energy needed to drive this cycle may be provided by low/intermediate grade heat sources: e.g., geothermal sources, industrial waste heat or concentrated solar power. In addition, as no precious metals are required in this approach, one can envisage using earth abundant elements to create viable water splitting catalysts.
We hope that the promising results presented in this ab initio study will motivate further theoretical and experimental investigations of dynamic ferroelectric surface chemistry and catalysis (i.e., periodic perturbations of temperature, strain, magnetic or electric fields). Topics for future theoretical work that improve upon this study include development of kinetic models to directly compute turn over frequencies, inclusion of more complex surface structures including disorder and a larger variety of defects, and an assessment of the importance of steps and step edges on the ferroelectric surface. We believe that due to the existence of a bulk order parameter (the polarization) that couples strongly both to external fields and to the surface chemistry, ferroelectric surfaces offer exciting opportunities for catalysis. This includes the possibility of moving beyond some of the fundamental limitations imposed by the Sabatier principle on the catalytic activity of fixed surface phases.44,78

 	Fig. 1  Reconstructions of the stoichiometric Pb-terminated PbTiO3 (001) surface. Local density of states at EF for (a) positive and (b) negative out-of-plane polarization. Pb atoms are gray balls, O magenta, Ti cyan, and the local density of states is in red. In (a), electrons accumulate in the surface conduction bands dominated by Pb 6p orbitals. In (b), holes accumulate in the O 2p-dominated valence bands. (c) Atomic projected density of states for negatively poled surfaces with blue arrows highlighting hole states. Left: electronic reconstruction for primitive (1 × 1) stoichiometric surface unit cell. Center: electronic reconstruction for geometrically reconstructed c(2 × 2) stoichiometric surface. Right: atomically reconstructed c(2 × 2) surface with 0.5 ML O vacancies. In going from left to center, the surface breaks symmetry thereby pushing filled states lower in energy and empty (hole) states higher in energy around EF. On the right, the removal of O atoms creates high energy hole states with strong Pb 6p contributions near the conduction band edge. Part (a) and (b) are rendered using the XCrySDen software.139	 

 	Fig. 2  Surface phase diagrams for the (001) surfaces of negatively polarized, paraelectric and positively polarized PbTiO3. Each colored region shows the most thermodynamically stable state as a function of O and Pb chemical potentials. The physically allowed region within which PbTiO3 is stable (against decomposition into various combinations of compounds made of Pb, Ti and O) is within the dashed trapezoid.	 

 	Fig. 3  Polarization-dependent surface phase diagrams of Pb-terminated (001) PbTiO3 surfaces as a function of H2O and O chemical potentials μH2O and μO. Each colored and labeled region represents the most stable thermodynamic surface phase. In the most relevant range of chemical potentials (−1 eV ≤ μH2O, μO ≤ 0 eV), the negatively-poled surface prefers to be covered with 1 ML of H, the paraelectric surface prefers to be stoichiometric, and the positively-poled surface has 1 ML OH.	 

 	Fig. 4  Water splitting (2H2O → O2 + 2H2) by cyclic switching between the negatively-poled and paraelectric surfaces of (001) PbTiO3. (a) Depicts the cycle. In brief, two H2O molecules are dissociated on negatively poled surface to produce bound atomic H; when the surface is switched to the paraelectric phase, the H atoms recombine to form weakly bound H2 making for a pristine surface ready for the next cycle. See the text for further details. (b) Shows the energy landscape for the cycle and includes meta-stable states (solid line segments) and transition states (circles connected by dotted lines). The oxygen formation barrier (between step I and II) is 0.4 eV, and the hydrogen formation energy (between step VI and VII, and also step VIII and IX) is 0.3 eV.	 

 	Fig. 5  Key structures during (a and b) H2O dissociation on the vacancy rich (0.5 ML O vacancy) negatively-poled PbTiO3 (001) surface and (b and c) H2 production on paraelectric surface. Grey balls are Pb, fuchsia balls are O, green balls are H, and blue Ti balls are encaged in the blue octahedra formed by the O. Each surface O vacancy makes for an octahedron with missing apex in (a). In (a), H2O molecules are above the negatively-poled surface. Each water molecule splits into H and OH barrierlessly: the H binds to the surface O and the OH fills the O vacancy to produce the thermodynamic ground state in (b) sporting 1 ML chemisorbed H. (c) Shows the ground state of the paraelectric surface: the H atoms from (b) form H2 molecules with a small barrier of 0.3 eV and are weakly physisorbed to this stoichiometric surface. This figure is rendered using VESTA.184	 

 	Fig. 6  Surface phase diagrams for the positively polarized (001) PbTiO3 surface for three different Pb chemical potentials. Left: the lowest possible physically allowed value of −2.6 eV as per Fig. 2. Center: an intermediate Pb chemical potential of −1.3 eV. Right: the highest physically allowed value of 0 eV. Regardless of the Pb chemical potential, the top right corner of the surface phase diagrams, which corresponds to high enough and reasonable partial pressures of oxygen and water, is dominated by a surface phase that does not favor Pb vacancies.	 

 	Fig. 7  Surface phase diagrams of the negatively-poled PbTiO3 surface as a function of the (fixed) magnitude of the substrate out-of-plane polarization within the range of −120.9 ≤ Pz ≤ 0 μC cm−2. For simplicity of presentation, when creating these diagrams we have only included surface phases with chemisorbed species and have excluded surface phases that have additional weakly physisorbed molecules.
