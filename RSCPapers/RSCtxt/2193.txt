1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are considered a promising photovoltaic technology because of their advantages such as light weight, low-cost, easy large-area fabrication via solution technologies, and compatibility with flexible substrates.1–3 With developments in materials, thin-film processing, fine-tuning of morphology, and optimization of device fabrication, the performance of OSCs has improved markedly in recent years.4–6
Researchers can obtain efficient and stable photovoltaic devices through innovative molecular design, including side chain engineering, main chain engineering and the introduction of a third component that is well compatible with host materials, etc.4–10 In addition, researchers can also optimize the device by morphology control to improve the performance of OSCs, such as preparation of devices with excellent morphology through additives and post-processing to improve the efficiency of the battery.5 Currently, the most advanced active layer of OSCs usually adopts the bulk heterojunction structure (BHJ), which is a blend of donor and acceptor. Among them, fullerene derivatives are the most used electron acceptors in the past few decades,11–13 and non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) such as ITIC and Y6 have been increasingly studied and applied in recent years.14–17 Donor materials participate in the whole process of exciton generation and dissociation in the BHJ, so their structure and properties have a crucial impact on the performance of OSCs. In order to obtain high-performance donor materials, effective strategies need to be developed for the design and synthesis of donor (D)–acceptor (A) type polymers. The donor unit and acceptor unit are alternately connected on the main chain of the polymer, and the molecular energy level could be adjusted to adapt to the acceptors by changing different electron rich and electron deficient units. The polymer structure could also be modified by side chain engineering.
Benzodithiophene (BDT) is one of the most widely used donor units in the design of high-efficiency polymers for OSCs so far, and it plays a crucial role in the development of OSCs.11,18–20 BDT has a higher π–π stacking capacity and hole mobility because of its larger planar conjugate structure.11 In addition, its synthesis and purification are relatively simple, and its structure is easy to modify.1,21–26 Researchers can introduce different substitute groups on the active sites on both sides of the BDT or copolymerize BDT with different electron-deficient moieties27 to adjust its properties, such as absorption and energy levels. According to the different side chain substitute groups, the BDTs can be divided into two categories, a symmetrical one-dimensional BDT (1D-BDT) and a symmetrical two-dimensional BDT (2D-BDT). The substituents at both sides of 1D-BDT are 1D side chains such as alkyl, alkoxy and alkylthio, while the substituents at both sides of 2D-BDT are 2D side chains such as alkylphenyl, alkoxyphenyl, alkylthiophenyl, alkylthiothienyl and naphthyl.
1D-BDTs contain a relatively soft alkyl chain, oxygen atoms, and sulfur atoms with strong electronegativity, which can ensure that the main chain of the polymer has tighter packing and stronger π–π interaction, and is conducive to obtaining a higher carrier mobility and short-circuit current density (JSC), but generally lower open-circuit voltage (VOC).18,28–33 2D-BDT-based polymers can enhance π–π interaction due to the extension of the conjugation in the axial direction, which is beneficial to improve the separation and transportation of excitons. At the same time, the VOC of the devices can also be improved due to the reduction of the electron donating ability of the aromatic substituents. However, rigid aromatic ring substituents may affect the ordered packing of the polymer, thereby affecting the formation of nano-interpenetrating networks in the active layer, and leading to a decreased JSC.20,34,35 In other words, 1D-BDT and 2D-BDT with symmetrical structures have their own advantages and disadvantages. How to combine the advantages and overcome their disadvantages is the key to the preparation of efficient BDT-based polymer donor materials. In 2016, our group led by Prof. Yang first proposed the “symmetry-breaking” strategy, and synthesized asymmetric 1D–2D BDT units (1D–2D BDT) with 1D alkoxyl and 2D phenyl/alkoxylphenyl as side chains.21 And then, different 2D side chains were introduced on BDT and obtained a series of asymmetric 2D–2D BDT units (2D–2D BDT) (Fig. 1).36 Asymmetric polymers with different side chains based on 1D–2D BDT and 2D–2D BDT have achieved a promising photovoltaic performance and quickly become one of the research hotspots. In addition, polymers with asymmetric backbones based on thienobenzodithiophene (TBD),37 dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran (DTPa),38,39 thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran (TBF),40–42 indenothiophene (IT),43,44 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),45,46 and isoindigo (IID)47 have been reported.

This review aims to summarize the recent research progress of asymmetric polymers developed using a symmetry-breaking strategy, including both polymers with asymmetric side chains and polymers with asymmetric backbones, as shown in Fig. 1. Taking the development of asymmetric polymers as the main line, the recent advances of OSCs based on asymmetric polymers (asy-OSCs) are introduced from the perspectives of molecular structure and photovoltaic properties. Finally, we look forward to the future development direction and prospects of asymmetric polymers and asy-OSCs.
2. OSCs based on polymers with asymmetric side chains
2.1 Polymers based on asymmetric BDT
Shin et al.48 designed and synthesized four new conjugated polymers P1, P2, P3 and P4 by introducing different side chains on the BDT unit (Fig. 2). The asymmetric polymer P4 obtains a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.12% due to its alkyl side chain and modified alkoxy side chain, which is superior to those of P3 (6.48%) and P1 (7.18%) based on symmetric alkyl or alkoxy side chains. Tan et al.49 synthesized two new conjugated polymers PSBDT–FBT and PSBDT–TID with different side chains based on asymmetric 4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-8-(2-ethylhexylthio)benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (SBDT) units (Fig. 2). Due to electron delocalization enhancement and intermolecular interaction, these polymers show deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. The OSCs based on PSBDT–FBT:PC61BM and PSBDT–TID:PC61BM show PCEs of 4.4% and 2.2%, respectively, while OSCs based on PSBDT–FBT:PC71BM exhibit improved JSC and VOC, and achieve a PCE of 5.0%. These studies indicate that BDT units with asymmetric side chains play an important role in the development of novel D–A conjugated polymers.
 Fig. 2  Structures of asymmetric polymers based on 1D–1D and 1D–2D BDT polymers. 
A series of asymmetric polymer donors for OSCs has been developed by combining 2D side chains (phenyl, thienyl, naphthyl, etc.) with 1D alkoxy side chains.21–23 Yang et al. have done a lot of research on asymmetric polymers. In 2016, Yang et al.21 synthesized donor polymers PBDTDTffBT–H, PBDTTT–H (Fig. 2) based on 1D–2D asymmetric BDT building blocks. The introduction of a 2D alkoxyphenyl side chain into the BDT unit expands the degree of conjugation and produces a deep HOMO energy level, which is beneficial to the improvement of VOC. The 1D alkoxy side chain can improve the solubility and morphology. In addition, the JSC and fill factor (FF) of the polymer also maintain a high value, which is due to the ordered microstructure which effectively enhances the π–π overlap of the extended conjugated phenyl unit. PBDTDTffBT–H-based devices show a PCE of 9.44% without any processing additives or post-processing, which was the highest value of reported BDT and 4,7-di(thiophen-2-ethylhexyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT) backbone photovoltaic polymers at the time. PBDTTT–H-based devices have also exhibited one of the highest PCE values of BDT and 2-ethylhexyl-3-fluorothieno [3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (TT) backbone conjugated polymers with a PCE of 9.38%. The results show that it is feasible to use a symmetry-breaking strategy to design high-performance OSC donors, which can not only significantly improve the VOC of BDT-based low bandgap polymers, but also ensure good JSC and FF. In 2017, Yang et al.50 synthesized and characterized two novel polymers PBDTPH–DTQx and PBDTPHO–DTQx (Fig. 2) based on 1D–2D asymmetric BDT units. These two polymers showed excellent photovoltaic properties by improving the planarity of the polymers. Compared with PBDTPHO–DTQx, the single phenyl of PBDTPH–DTQx gives the polymer more planarity and facilitates π–π stacking. The device based on PBDTPH–DTQx shows a PCE of 5.6%. A polymer donor material P5 (Fig. 2) based on asymmetric BDT units was reported by Yang and co-workers.51 Due to the better conformation and intermolecular interaction of the P5 polymer with a flexible alkoxy chain, P5 devices have better heterojunction morphology and more balanced charge transfer. The device based on P5:PC71BM achieves the best PCE of 8.58%. In addition, toluene is used for the first time to optimize the photovoltaic performance of non-fullerene polymer solar cells (NF-PSCs) based on P5:ITIC (Fig. 3), and obtains a PCE of 9.06%.
 Fig. 3  Structures of NFAs related in this article. 
In 2017, we synthesized asymmetric BDT donor polymers with α- and β-substituted naphthalene groups for the first time (Fig. 2).22 The results show that the PCE of OSCs based on PBDTβNPFBT:PC71BM is 9.80%, which is beneficial to the low saturation dark current density (JS) produced by the appropriate π–π distance of PBDTβNPFBT. At the same time, the naphthalene ring achieves a wide absorption and narrow bandgap by expanding the π conjugation degree, which is beneficial to capture more photons and improve the JSC. Studies have shown that β-naphthalene substituents can better balance the bandgap and VOC, thus significantly improving the PCE. In addition, the OSCs based on PBDTβNPFBT:ITIC also achieve an impressive PCE of 7.33% without any treatment. Yang et al.52 reported two novel polymers, PαNBDT–T1 and PβNBDT–T1 (Fig. 2), using α- and β-naphthalene substituents as asymmetric BDT side chains as donor building units and fluorinated benzotriazole derivatives as acceptor electron withdrawing units. In the ITIC system, PαNBDT–T1 with weak intermolecular packing shows excellent blend film morphology, and the best device obtains a high PCE of 9.6%. In the PC71BM system, the optical properties of PβNBDT–T1 are slightly better than those of PαNBDT–T1, but generally speaking, the two polymers do not show ideal optical properties because of the mismatch of absorption spectra. Yang et al.53 reported a medium bandgap light-harvesting polymer asy-PBDBTN based on asymmetric BDT (Fig. 2). The asy-PBDBTN:PC71BM-based device obtains a PCE of 8.88%, while the asy-PBDBTN:ITIC-based device has enhanced π–π stacking behavior of the donor and ITIC after thermal annealing treatment, and finally shows a PCE of 10.50%. In the non-fullerene system, the relatively low energy loss (Eloss) is the key factor to overcoming the trade-off between VOC and JSC and to obtaining high VOC and JSC at the same time.
Thiophene can also be used as a 2D side chain to fabricate 1D–2D asymmetric BDT units.23,54 Yang et al.23 designed and synthesized a series of new medium bandgap polymers (PBDTsTh–FBT) and wide bandgap polymers (PBDTsThPh–BDD and PBDTsPhPh–BDD) (Fig. 2) by introducing different numbers of aromatic rings into the BDT side chain, which matched fullerene PC71BM and ITIC, respectively. The results show that a bicontinuous interpenetrating network can be formed based on the highly ordered polymer PBDTsTh–FBT and roughly spherical PC71BM, and the resulting PCE is higher than 10%. The rigid benzene ring side chain of amorphous polymers PBDTsThPh–BDD and PBDTsPhPh–BDD can be used as lever arms to show good compatibility with slender ITIC, and a PCE higher than 10% can be obtained. In 2018, a novel polymer PBDTTh–DTffBT (Fig. 2) was synthesized by Yang et al.54 for the first time using alkylthiophene units as side chain substituents on asymmetric BDT building blocks. The 1D side chain on the BDT unit improves the solubility and morphology, while the 2D side chain increases the conjugation degree and decreases the HOMO energy level. The results show that PBDTTh–DTffBT and PC71BM have better performance after optimization than the polymer with the same main chain structure of the symmetric BDT unit, and obtains a PCE of 9.22%. In addition, PBDTTh–DTffBT:ITIC based OSCs also achieve an impressive PCE of 7.83%. After that a novel asymmetric BDT-based polymer PBDTBDD–Th (Fig. 2) was designed and synthesized by Yang and Sun.55 Carbon atoms are used to replace sulfur atoms in the side chain of polymer PBDTsTh–BDD (Fig. 2) so as to weaken the strong self-aggregation of the polymer chain and provide enough embedding space for ITIC to form good morphology. The results show that the PCE of the PBDTBDD–Th:ITIC-based device (10.02%) is higher than that of PBDTsTh–BDD:ITIC (7.09%). This work provides a simple and convenient method for weakening the aggregation and controlling the morphology of NF-PSCs. Yang et al.56 synthesized asymmetric polymers PBDTsPhPh–T1 and PBDTsThPh–T1 and then applied them to NF-PSCs (Fig. 2). In order to weaken the interchain aggregation of polymers, twisted aryl side chains (benzene–benzene ring and thiophene–benzene ring) were introduced into the asymmetric BDT donor unit as lever arms to fully stir with slender ITIC molecules to form a good blend morphology, which is conducive to exciton dissociation and charge transport. The NF-PSCs based on PBDTsThPh–T1 and PBDTsPhPh–T1 obtain PCEs of 9.34% and 8.85% respectively.
Yang et al.57 designed and synthesized polymers P6 and P7 composed of asymmetric BDT units and different acceptor units (Fig. 2). The devices prepared by polymer P6:PC71BM show a PCE of 8.45%. In the ITIC system, due to the poor complementarity of the absorption spectra, polymer P6 shows a lower PCE (6.35%) than that in the PC71BM system. In order to match the absorption of ITIC, the DTffBT unit in P6 was replaced by the weak electron withdrawing group BDD and obtained polymer P7. The OSCs based on P7:ITIC show an excellent PCE of 10.04%. Sun et al.58 designed and synthesized two novel D–A polymers PBNO and PBNS using NTD–O and NTD–S as the electron withdrawing units and asymmetric BDT as the donor units, respectively (Fig. 2). The results showed that the PCE of PBNO blended with PC71BM is 4.71%. Due to the good solubility of PBNS in the PC71BM system and wide visible absorption at 400–730 nm, the related OSCs showed a significantly enhanced PCE of 7.58%.
The above works show that polymers based on asymmetric BDT with different aromatic 2D side chains and 1D side chains can combine the advantages of 1D and 2D symmetric BDT, which plays an important role in improving the performance of photovoltaic devices and obtaining impressive PCE. In addition to the design of 1D–2D asymmetric donor materials, the development of a new 2D–2D asymmetric side chain BDT-based polymer is also an effective way to improve the performance of photovoltaic devices.36,59–61
Yang et al.36 controlled the morphology of donor–acceptor blends from a structural point of view and proposed an effective strategy for the preparation of OSCs without post-treatment. A series of polymers based on asymmetric BDT with different 2D side chains, named PBDTTAZ–Ph, PBDTTAZ–NaPh, PBDTTAZ–PhPh, PBDTTAZPh–R, PBDTTAZPh–OR and PBDTTAZPh–SR (Fig. 4) were successfully constructed. The thienylthiol group with a long alkyl chain as one side substituent of the BDT unit can adjust the energy level, broaden the absorption spectrum and improve the solubility. The other key side chain had a bare rigid aryl ring as a lever arm, which can not only stir the slender ITIC but also weaken the entanglement between the polymer chains. Therefore, good morphology can be obtained without post-processing, and the photovoltaic performance of the device can be improved. Finally, the results showed that the polymer PBDTTAZ–NaPh produces a high PCE of 11.56%, and proves the important advantage of the naphthalene ring in controlling the morphology. In order to design high performance NF-PSCs, Yang et al.59 synthesized two new wide bandgap polymers with different aggregation degrees (PBDTBDD–Ph and PBDTBDD–PhPh) (Fig. 4) matching with fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) with different sizes (ITIC–4T, ITIC–3T, and ITIC–2T) (Fig. 3). Because the weakly aggregated polymer (PBDTBDD–Ph) can provide more embedding space for FREAs, the small size ITIC–3T was easier to be embedded in the gap of the polymer chain, which was beneficial to improve the performance. The results showed that a PCE of 11.02% can be obtained from the OSCs based on the weak aggregation of PBDTBDD–Ph and small size ITIC–3T. He and co-workers60 synthesized asymmetric 2D BDT-based polymers, namely PBPTBz–1Cl and PBPTBz–2Cl, through reasonable design of donor materials (Fig. 4). Chloro-thiophene was introduced as the side chain in the BDT unit. Because of the large dipole moment of the C–Cl bond, the Cl atom enhanced the ICT effect and effectively reduced the HOMO energy level of the polymer. In addition, the introduction of alkoxylphenyl as another side chain of the BDT unit can also reduce the HOMO energy level of the polymer, thanks to the high ionization potential and low electron density. When PBPTBz–2Cl was matched with the small molecule acceptor IT-M (Fig. 3), a PCE of 7.18% was obtained. An asymmetric polymer PBDTFBTA–TSi and its symmetrical analogues (Fig. 4) with the same backbone were designed and synthesized by Peng and co-workers,61 which were matched with non-fullerene Y6 (Fig. 3) for high efficiency OSCs. The results show that the HOMO energy level of the polymer increases with the increase of siloxane functional group content, which leads to a slight decrease in VOC. However, the introduction of siloxane functional groups can improve the compatibility, carrier mobility and phase separation of the blend films, which is beneficial to exciton diffusion and dissociation. A champion PCE of 14.18% is obtained by the device based on the asymmetric PBDTFBTA–TSi, which is higher than that of the symmetrical analogues (11.76% and 11.92%). This also proves that the siloxane asymmetric side chain engineering is a promising design strategy in the development of high-performance polymer donor materials. The parameters of all OSCs based on asymmetric BDT-based polymers in the literature are summarized in Table 1.

2.2 Polymers based on symmetric BDT and asymmetric units
In addition to the asymmetric BDT-based polymers, it is also possible to polymerize asymmetric polymers from symmetric BDT and asymmetric units, such as carboxylate-substituted thiophene,62,63 3-cyanothiophene,64 and single halogenated BT.65,66
Using one carboxylate as the electron withdrawing unit, Chen et al.62 designed and synthesized two novel asymmetric wide bandgap polymers PBDT–2TC and PBDT–S–2TC for non-fullerene OSCs (Fig. 5). The binding of carboxylate-substituted thiophene to the thiophene bridge on the main chain greatly reduced the steric hindrance, which was beneficial to the tight π–π stacking. Both polymers have appropriate HOMO energy levels in relation to that of the ITIC acceptor, and balanced hole and electron transport. The non-fullerene OSCs based on PBDT–S–2TC:ITIC obtain high PCEs of 10.12% with a high VOC of 0.96 V. An et al.63 developed two asymmetric polymer donors PBDT–F–2TC and PBDT–SF–2TC for NF-PSCs (Fig. 5). Both polymers match well with NFA IT–4F (Fig. 3), thanks to the synergistic effect of the asymmetric carboxylate unit and fluorine/sulfur atoms, and high VOC and JSC (up to 20.73 mA cm−2) were simultaneously obtained, realizing a good trade-off between VOC and JSC. The OSCs based on PBDT–F–2TC and PBDT–SF–2TC obtain PCEs of 10.75% and 11.07%, respectively.
 Fig. 5  Structures of polymers based on a symmetric BDT and asymmetric unit. 
Duan et al.64 reported a new building block 3-cyanothiophene for the construction of high-performance donor polymer PBCT–2F (Fig. 5) which benefits from the asymmetry of 3-cyanothiophene and the appropriate electron-withdrawing ability of the cyanide group. The PBCT–2F matched with the NFA Y6 to achieve a high PCE of 17.1%. More importantly, PBCT–2F exhibited outstanding photovoltaic properties and superior batch-to-batch reproducibility, which make it a donor polymer with potential for commercial application. These results also indicate the great potential of 3-cyanothiophene in OSCs.
The polymer composed of the BDT unit and BT unit is also an excellent donor material. He and co-workers65 designed and synthesized novel polymers PBDTHD–CIBTDD with chlorinated benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit and alkyl thiophene-substituted BDT as the donor unit. PBDTHD–CIBTDD (Fig. 5) with an optimized side chain distribution has a high mobility due to strong π–π stacking in the film. The OSCs based on PBDTHD–CIBTDD:PC71BM achieve a PCE of 9.11%. Although the introduction of Cl atoms increased the torsion angle of the main chain, the chlorinated polymers maintained good orientation in the blend film for efficient OSC applications. Their results indicated that chlorination was an effective method to fine-tune conjugated polymer energy levels to improve device performance. Jin and co-workers67 synthesized a novel random conjugated polymer asy-PBDTPBT (Fig. 5) and investigated the effects of random polymerization and the introduction of an asymmetric third component on its properties. Compared with PBDTP, asy-PBDTPBT showed higher irregularity and lower crystallinity, which inhibited charge recombination and resulted in a higher JSC and FF. The OSCs based on asy-PBDTPBT:ITIC–Th (Fig. 3) achieved a PCE of 8.22%, which is better than that of PBDTP (7.37%). Hao and co-workers66 obtained two regionally asymmetric polymer donors PR2F and PR1F based on asymmetric fluorinated benzothiadiazole–thiophene (BT–T) units, which have three repeating units A–D–A, π–D–A and π–D–π along the polymer skeleton (Fig. 5). Both regionally asymmetric polymers showed lower HOMO energy levels, and a higher VOC (∼1 V). Compared with PR1F-based devices, PR2F-based devices achieved a higher PCE (4.73%) due to their relatively high and balanced carrier mobilities.
Researchers also designed and synthesized polymers with symmetric BDT units and asymmetric TT units.68,69 Yu et al.68 reported the superior and synthetically economic route of the key monomer 4,8-bis(5′-((2′′-ethylhexyl)thio)-4′-fluorothiophen-2′-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)-bis(trimethylstannane) (BDTT–SF), and successfully designed and synthesized PBDTT–SF–TT (Fig. 5). After device optimization, the OSCs based on PBDTT–SF–TT:PC71BM achieved a PCE of 9.07%. In order to study the relationship between molecular conformation, morphology and photovoltaic properties of polymers, two new polymers PBDTTT–S–T and PDT–S–T (Fig. 5) were designed and synthesized by Hou and co-workers.69 The main chain of PDT–S–T has a more linear conformation, which is conducive to the formation of more ordered interchain stacking. In addition, from PBDTTT–S–T to PDT–S–T, the distance between adjacent alkyl side groups increased and the steric hindrance decreased, so PDT–S–T had stronger and tighter intermolecular π–π packing. The results show that the PCE of PBDTTT–S–T:PC71BM-based OSCs using additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) is 5.93%, while PDT–S–T:PC71BM-based OSCs showed a PCE of 7.79% without any special treatment.
Zou et al.70 first designed and synthesized a quinoxaline-based polymer TPQ-1 (Fig. 5) with an asymmetric side chain. The OSCs based on TPQ-1 and strongly crystalline o-IDTBR (Fig. 3) achieved a PCE of 8.6%. After adding 15% PTB7–Th, the device efficiency reached 9.6%. This was due to the combination of “weak crystalline donor and strong crystalline acceptor” which can effectively maintain ideal nano-scale phase separated aggregation and a more uniform phase separation scale, enabling efficient exciton separation and charge transfer. This provided a design idea for researchers to rationally regulate the performance of OSCs from the perspective of material synthesis. In 2020, Negash et al.71 designed and synthesized two new polymers PBDTTSi–TzBI and PBDTTS–TzBI based on a symmetric BDT unit and asymmetric pyrrolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole-5,7(6H)-dione (TzBI) units (Fig. 5). They studied the effect of different side chains on the photovoltaic performance of the polymers in fullerenes and NF-PSCs. The results showed that PBDTTSi–TzBI exhibited a deep HOMO level, resulting in a higher VOC. However, the PCE of OSCs based on PBDTTS–TzBI:PC71BM is 7.32%, which is higher than that of PBDTTSi–TzBI (3.98%). The OSC performance was significantly improved when ITIC was used as the acceptor. The PCE of the OSCs based on PBDTTSi–TzBI:ITIC and PBDTTS–TzBI:ITIC are 6.85% and 9.60%, respectively. The better performance of the PBDTTS–TzBI: ITIC device could be attributed to the strong and wide absorption and balanced carrier mobility. Because the precise modulation of the π bridge significantly affects the photoelectric properties of the D–A polymer, Zhen et al.72 synthesized four polymers PTB2T–F, PTB2T–Cl, P2TB2T–F and P2TB2T–Cl by introducing a symmetrical and asymmetric π bridge (Fig. 5). Compared with P2TB2T–F and P2TB2T–Cl with a symmetric π bridge, PTB2T–F and PTB2T–Cl with an asymmetric π bridge have better planarity, stronger intermolecular interaction, and higher hole mobility. When blended with IT–4F, PTB2T–F based OSCs showed a better device performance, achieving a promising PCE of 10.79%. The results indicated that the precise modulation of π bridges is a promising strategy for the construction of efficient D–A polymer donors. Zhu and co-workers73 successfully synthesized two novel asymmetric wide bandgap polymers PBDTTS–IQ and PBDTTS–DFIQ (Fig. 5). Compared with the PBDTTS–IQ:PC71BM blends, the PBDTTS–DFIQ:PC71BM blends showed better exciton dissociation and charge extraction efficiency, more balanced carrier mobility and better morphology. Therefore, the PCE of the OSCs based on PBDTTS–DFIQ:PC71BM (7.4%) is higher than that of PBDTTS–IQ:PC71BM (4.96%). The results suggest that the asymmetric indolo[2,3-b]quinoxaline (IQ) skeleton is a promising electron withdrawal unit for the construction of light-harvesting polymers for highly effective OSCs.
In 2019, Hou et al.74 reported an asymmetric polymer donor, PTO2 (Fig. 5), which exhibited a high PCE of 14.7% when matched with the NFA IT–4F. Benefiting from the large molecular electrostatic potential between PTO2 and IT–4F, the formation of loosely bound charged pairs with extended lifetimes hinders the recombination of carriers in the blends, resulting in the device possessing efficient charge generation at a low driving force. In 2021, they75 designed an acceptor A4T-16 (Fig. 3) with good planarity and large steric hindrance which was used to mix with the polymer donor PTO2. The results show that the PTO2:A4T-16-based cell achieves a PCE of 11.8%. Tong et al.76 optimized the device performance by adding a phenanthroimidazole-based small molecule material TPPI–TPE as a morphology regulator into the PTO2:IT–4F system and a high PCE of 13.59% was obtained based on PTO2:10 wt%TPPI–TPE:IT–4F ternary OSCs.
Ding et al.77 designed and synthesized a new asymmetric copolymer D16 by using the thiolactone unit 5H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiopyran-5-one (DTTP) (Fig. 5). It exhibits strong π–π stacking and high hole mobility. OSCs with D16 as the donor and Y6 as the acceptor yielded a high PCE up to 16.72%. Based on this work, they78 synthesized a new D–A copolymer donor D18 (Fig. 5) based on a fused-ring acceptor unit dithieno [3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole. Compared with DTTP, dithieno [3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5] thiadiazole has a larger molecular plane, which endows D18 with a higher hole mobility. The PCE of D18:Y6 solar cells is as high as 18.22%, which indicates the great potential of dithieno [3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6] benzo[1,2-c] [1,2,5] thiadiazole-based copolymer donors for OSCs. The parameters of OSCs based on asymmetric polymers containing an symmetric BDT and asymmetric unit are summarized in Table 2.

2.3 Regional rules
Regional selectivity and regional regularity play an important role in the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. The main chain configuration of asymmetric conjugated polymers has a great influence on the photovoltaic performance, and improving the regional regularity is an effective way to enhance the photovoltaic performance of polymers.79–87
Yan and co-workers79 reported a series of polymers (PffBT–T4–2HD, PffBT–T3(1,3), PffBT–T3(1,2)-1, PffBT–T3(1,2)-2, PffBT–T2) (Fig. 6) based on difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT) and oligomeric thiophene, such as tetrothiophene (T4), trithiophene (T3) and dithiophene (T2). The results showed that T3 polymers with asymmetric arrangement of the alkyl chains can achieve efficient thick film OSCs with PCEs up to 10.5% without using any processing additives. By reducing the number of thiophene rings, the effective density of ffBT units in the polymerization backbone is increased, and the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of T3 are significantly deeper than those of T4. Therefore, the VOC and JSC of T3 are higher than those of T4. By comparing three T3 polymers with different positions and sizes of alkyl chains, T3 polymers with an asymmetric arrangement of alkyl chains have better morphology and significantly enhanced performance and achieved the best performance of OSCs. A morphology study showed that compared with the T4 polymer, the optimized ffBT–T3 polymer domain size and crystallinity decreased. The change of the T4 to T3 polymer units and the novel arrangement of alkyl chains provide an important tool for regulating the energy level and morphological properties of donor polymers, further improving the efficiency of OSCs.
 Fig. 6  Structures of polymers based on regional rules. 
Ma et al. have done a lot of work on the study of the effect of regional rules on the performance of polymers and solar cells.80–82 They80 successfully synthesized three polymers, PBT, PFT and PPT (Fig. 6), by combining two different electron donor fragments (BDT and silaindacenodithiophene (SiIDT)) with an asymmetric electron withdrawing unit (BT, FBT or pyridyl-[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT)). The results showed that compared with PBT, PFT and PPT using an asymmetric electron withdrawing unit had a flatter main chain conformation, stronger intermolecular contact, a higher degree of structural order, and a deeper HOMO level, which was attributed to the regioregularity control over the precise orientation of the FBT or PT fragments relative to the backbone. When mixed with PC61BM, the PCE of the PPT-based device is 7.3%, which is higher than that of PFT (6.9%) and PBT (6.2%). When mixed with ITIC, the PCE of the PPT-based device is 5.4%, also higher than that of the PFT and PBT devices (4.4% and 4.9%). They81 also designed and synthesized two regioregular narrow bandgap conjugated polymers with a D′–A–D–A repeating unit structure, namely PIFCF and PSFCF (Fig. 6). Compared to the previously reported regioregular polymer PIPCP, PIFCF and PSFCF exhibited wider bandgaps, tighter π–π stacking, and improved hole mobilities, achieving regioregular control over the precise orientation of the FBT fragments relative to the backbone vector. When incorporated into solar cells with fullerene acceptors, the Eloss values of the PIFCF and PSFCF devices were increased compared to solar cells based on PIPCP. These findings provided ideas for the design of photovoltaic polymer materials with high performance and low loss. Ma and Bazan82 designed and synthesized conjugated polymers PF-0, PF-1a, PF-1b, and PF-2 with a D–A–D′–A repeating unit structure (Fig. 6). Compared with PF-0, the fluorinated analogues exhibited stronger light absorption, lower HOMO energy levels and a more ordered solid film structure, and the PCE was significantly improved. Due to the introduction of the electron withdrawing unit FBT and fine-tuning the orientation of FBT fragments, regioregularity and graded fluorination of the polymer backbone were achieved. Furthermore, the fluorinated polymer PF-1b with the optimal regioselectivity showed a more ordered solid structure than PF-1a, enhanced intermolecular contact and improved charge transfer, and significantly increased the PCE from 7.02% (PF-1a) to 8.42% (PF-1b). This suggested that fluorination and regioselectivity play an important role in polymer properties.
Huang and co-workers83 introduced an asymmetric 5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole to a thiophene-based polymer backbone to generate polymers with controlled regioregularity. The regioregularity of fluorine modification affects the molecular dipole moment of the conjugate backbone, which makes the interfacial packing of the conjugate chain more compact, and then promotes the formation of blend film morphology and improves the PCE. In addition, the effects of side chain length and symmetry on the nanostructure and device performance of blends were systematically studied. When the side chain was combined with the regioregularity of the skeleton, the interchain π–π stacking, crystal orientation and phase separation morphology were significantly affected. The results showed that the optimal polymer BO/HD–RR (Fig. 6) achieves a PCE of 9.06%, which indicated that the local chemical environment could significantly affect the physical properties of the resultant material.
In order to study the influence of a regioregular polymer on photovoltaic performance, Hou et al.84 synthesized the regioregular polymer PBDT–TSR (Fig. 6) based on alkythio-substituted 2D-BDT and the asymmetric TT unit. Compared with its random counterpart PBDT–TS1, PBDT–TSR had a stronger interchain π–π stacking effect, and the hole mobility of PBDT–TSR was three times that of PBDT–TS1. The OSCs based on PBDT–TSR achieved a high PCE of 10.2% with a JSC of 17.99 mA cm−2, while the PBDT–TS1 device achieved a 9.74% PCE.
Yang and co-workers used an asymmetric thiazole unit as the π bridge to study the effect of the regioregularity of polymers on their photovoltaic properties.85,86 They85 synthesized two D–A polymers PTBTZ-2 and PTBTZ-5 with different orientations in order to study the influence of different orientations of thiazoles relative to the TT groups on their properties (Fig. 6). The results showed that PTBTZ-2 has a lower HOMO level and a better molecular configuration than PTBTZ-5, and can mix well with PC71BM. Therefore, the PCE of OSCs is up to 9.72%, and the JSC is up to 16.84 mA cm−2. They86 also introduced thiazole units as π bridges on the polymer backbone to regulate the molecular skeleton, enhance the intermolecular interactions of the polymer and reduce the ionization potential (Fig. 6). The results showed that the device based on PBTZT–4R achieves a PCE of 9.63% with a high JSC of 17.56 mA cm−2, which is due to the flatter molecular conformation, stronger redshift absorption and better crystallinity of PBTZT–4R, and can be well mixed with PC71BM. This work not only demonstrated that thiazole-induced effects can be used to regulate the energy levels, crystallinity, and π–π stacking but also revealed that the orientation of asymmetric units on the polymerization backbone (i.e. regional selectivity and regional regularity) was crucial to the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs. The parameters of all OSCs based on regional rules in the literature are summarized in Table 3.

3. OSCs based on polymers with an asymmetric main chain
In recent years, researchers have focused most of their efforts on the side chain engineering of BDT based polymers,21–23,51,53,54,57,59 and have proved that the optimized side chain can not only broaden the spectral absorption, but also easily control the polymer stacking and bulk heterojunction morphology. Compared with the side chain engineering, the subtle changes of the backbone, such as the changes of structure and conformation, will also significantly affect the exciton dissociation and transport of OSCs. In fact, the backbone engineering of the polymer is also an important factor in improving the photovoltaic performance.37,38,43,47,88–90
Molecular configuration and conformation are two important but less studied structural factors in the molecular design of photovoltaic polymers. The study on the regularity of the poly(3-hexylthiophenes) (P3HT) region is the first important example that has proved that optimizing the molecular configuration can improve the photovoltaic performance of the conjugated polymer.91 Yang et al.37 designed a novel asymmetric electron donor unit thienobenzodithiophene (TBD) and synthesized four TBD-based polymers based on TBD, namely PTBD–BZ, PTBD–BDD, PTBD–FBT and PTBD–Tz (Fig. 7). The extended conjugated backbone of the polymer ensures effective carrier transportation. In addition, the dihedral angle between the TBD core and the conjugated side chain effectively regulates the aggregation and crystallinity of the polymer. Photovoltaic devices based on wide bandgap polymers PTBD–BZ and PTBD–BDD achieve PCEs of 12.02% and 11.39% respectively without any post-processing. Surprisingly, the device based on the medium bandgap polymer PTBD–Tz achieves a PCE of 11.02% with a high VOC of 1.02 V and JSC of 17.54 mA cm−2. This result showed that it is a feasible strategy to achieve a high VOC and JSC at the same time and to balance the relationship between them by modifying the main chain. The parameters of OSCs based on polymers with asymmetric backbones in the literature are summarized in Table 4.

3.1 Polymers based on asymmetric DTPa
In order to increase the electron donating ability of cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b]dithiophene (CPDT), an electron-rich oxygen atom was introduced to CPDT and obtained a new asymmetric electron donor unit named dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran (DTPa).92,93
Zhou et al.38 designed and synthesized three asymmetric D–A polymers based on asymmetric DTPa and BT substituted with different numbers of fluorine atoms, named PDTPa–BT, PDTPa–fBT and PDTPa–ffBT (Fig. 8). With the increase of fluorine atoms in the BT unit, the absorption spectrum peaks of the three polymers gradually blue shift, and the HOMO level gradually decreases. The asymmetric structure of fBT results in a more complex multichromophore system of the polymer PDTPa–fBT, which increases the absorption full-width-at-half-maximum of the polymer, resulting in a decrease in the absorption strength and carrier mobility. The results show that PSCs based on PDTPa–BT, PDTPa–fBT, and PDTPa–ffBT obtain PCEs of 4.01%, 3.70% and 5.26%, respectively. Zhou et al.94 inserted hexylthiophene (HT) as a π bridge between the asymmetric donor DTPa and BT derivative electron withdrawing units in order to study the effect of the conjugated π bridge and fluorination on the properties of the asymmetric block polymers. Three asymmetric block polymers PDTPa–HTBT, PDTPa–HTfBT and PDTPa–HTffBT were designed and synthesized (Fig. 8). The introduction of the HT π-bridge significantly reduces intramolecular charge transfer, which affects the optical properties and charge transport properties of the polymer. The PCE, VOC, JSC and FF improve gradually with the increase of fluorine atom number in the BT unit. The influence of fluoridation on photovoltaic performance was enlarged by the HT π-bridge, and the PCE of the polymer is increased from 1.56% of PDTPa–HTBT to 4.39% of PDTPa–HTfBT and 6.09% of PDTPa–HTffBT. They found that the steric hindrance of the alkyl substituents of HT led to an obvious increase in dihedral angles and consequently affected the conjugation of the resulting polymers. In order to solve this problem, they employed thiophene as a π bridge and benzo[d] [1,2,3] triazole (BTA) as the electron withdrawing unit to synthesize two new conjugated polymers PDTPa–TBTA and PDTPa–TffBTA95 (Fig. 8). The absorption peak was red shifted, the shoulder peak became obvious and the intermolecular interaction was enhanced after the introduction of the fluorine substituent on the BTA unit. The OSCs based on PDTPa–TBTA obtain a PCE of 2.22%, which is lower than that of PDTPa–TffBTA (3.43%).
 Fig. 8  Structures of asymmetric polymers based on DTPa, IDT and IDTP units. 
Similar to DTPa, Xu et al.39 introduced oxygen atoms into the indacenodithiophene (IDT) motif, creating a new electron donor unit pyran-bridged indacenodithiophene (IDTP) (Fig. 8). Compared with PIDT–FBT, the twisted backbone of PIDTP–FBT leads to an asymmetric arrangement of its side chain surface, and the π–π stacking effect was enhanced, showing a larger absorption range. In addition, the introduction of oxygen atoms deeper in the HOMO energy level, leads to higher VOC. This work demonstrated that even small changes in structure can significantly affect the photoelectric properties, geometries and packing properties of conjugated polymers. The parameters of OSCs based on DTPa-based asymmetric polymers in the literature are summarized in Table 5.

3.2 Polymers based on asymmetric TBF
Thieno[2,3-f]benzofuran (TBF)96 is another promising asymmetric electron donor building block since it inherited and integrates advantages of both the BDT unit and benzodifuran (BDF) unit. The Zou group designed and synthesized a series of TBF-based conjugated polymers and applied them to OSCs.40–42,97–99 They40 synthesized and characterized a novel alkylthiophene substituted TBF-based asymmetric polymer PTBFTDTBT (Fig. 9). The variation of the heteroatom (O/S) in the polymer backbone affected the performance of OSCs. The results showed that PTBFTDTBT had a high molecular weight, good solubility in common organic solvents, wide visible absorption in the range of 300∼750 nm, a relatively deep HOMO energy level (−5.2 eV) and high hole mobility. The PSCs based on PTBFTDTBT:PC71BM show a PCE of 6.42%, a VOC of 0.78 V, a JSC of 13.51 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61% without any post-processing. They41,98 further designed and synthesized polymers based on alkoxyphenyl and alkylthiophenyl TBF-based polymers PTBFP–BT, PTBFP–BO and TBFPS–BT through Stille coupling polymerization (Fig. 9). All the polymers have wide and strong absorption bands between 300 and 750 nm in the solid state. PTBFP–BT, PTBFP–BO and TBFPS–BT have deep HOMO energy levels of −5.47 eV, −5.61 eV and −5.39 eV, respectively. The OSCs based on PTBFP–BT: PC71BM, PTBFP–BO:PC71BM and TBFPS–BT: PC71BM obtain PCEs of 6.02%, 4.41% and 6.55%, respectively. Based on this work, they42 introduced a fluorine atom to the alkoxyphenyl of the TBF unit and obtained two asymmetric low bandgap polymers named TBFPF–BT and TBFPF–BO (Fig. 9). Both polymers exhibit wide absorption (300–800 nm) and a narrow bandgap in the thin film state. Compared with TBFPF–BO, the TBFPF–BT:PC71BM blend film showed better surface morphology and higher hole mobility. After optimizing the morphology, 6.80% PCE of polymer TBFPF–BT-based devices is obtained, which is obviously better than that of TBFPF–BO-based devices (PCE = 5.98%). In 2017, they97,99 polymerized alkoxyphenyl and alkoxy TBF and BDD to form new polymers TBF–BDD and TBFO–BDD (Fig. 9). The OSCs based on TBF–BDD:PC71BM and TBFO:PC71BM achieve PCEs of 6.58% and 3.21%, respectively. When blended with the small molecule acceptor ITIC, they had good complementary absorption in the 300–800 nm range. In addition, they have suitable energy levels, phase separation interpenetrating networks and balanced carrier mobility. The results showed that the PCE of the OSCs based on TBF–BDD:ITIC is 7.13%, which is higher than that of the fullerene-based devices.
 Fig. 9  Structures of asymmetric polymers based on the TBF unit. 
Sun and co-workers88,100 designed and synthesized asymmetrical polymers (PTBFDO–BDD, PTBFEH–BDD, PTBFSDO–BDD and PTBFSEH–BDD) based on alkylthienyl and alkylthiothienyl TBF units with different alkyl side chains (Fig. 9). The Eloss of PTBFDO–BDD-based OSCs was below the common value of OSCs, and a PCE of 7.15% can be obtained without any pre-processing and post-processing. Due to the synergistic effect of oxygen and sulfur in the main chain and optimized side chain, compared with PTBFSDO–BDD and PTBFSEH–BDD, PTBFEH–BDD had a higher absorption coefficient, more suitable aggregation, and better hole mobility, thus obtaining higher JSC and FF. The PCE of PTBFEH–BDD: ITIC-based OSCs without any post-processing or additives is 11.13%, with a JSC of 17.76 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.893 V and FF of 70.16%, which is comparable with its BDT counterparts. The results showed that the synergistic effect of the side chain and main chain engineering provided a new insight into the relationship between the structure and photovoltaic performance of NF-PSCs.
In 2020, Yang et al.101 proposed a terpolymer strategy based on the asymmetric TBD, TBF and BDD unit. (Fig. 9). The TBF segment promoted dense molecular stacking, while the TBD segment was expected to inhibit the formation of strong aggregation and regulate energy loss. TBD50:IT–4F achieved effective exciton dissociation by precisely adjusting the ratio of TBD and TBF segments, inhibited carrier recombination, and achieved long-lived carriers thanks to the better interpenetrating network. The TBD50:IT–4F device exhibited an impressive PCE of 14.2%. In addition, a ternary polymerization strategy was also suitable for strong aggregation systems. In particular, the OSCs based on TBD50:Y6 achieved a high PCE of 15.0%, which is one of the best values reported for polymers that do not use BDT units. These results provide a new terpolymer strategy for enriching the diversity of organic photovoltaic materials and improving PCE. The parameters of OSCs based on TBF-based asymmetric polymers in the literature are summarized in Table 6.

3.3 Polymers based on asymmetric IT
Fluorene is a commonly used planar aromatic unit for the construction of donor–acceptor polymers.1 The asymmetric indenothiophene (IT) is formed when one of the two benzene rings in fluorene is replaced by a thiophene ring.102
In 2016, Zheng et al.43 first synthesized two IT-based asymmetric polymers PITBT and PITFBT (Fig. 10). With a diphenyl ether (DPE) additive, PITFBT-based devices obtain a PCE of 9.14% and a VOC of 0.903 V. The results showed that IT was an excellent donor unit that has never been explored, which broadens the selection range for the development of high-performance polymer donor units. Based on this work, they44 designed a novel wide bandgap IT-based polymer PIT2FBT by introducing fluorine atoms on the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) unit (Fig. 10). PIT2FBT had a wide bandgap (1.82 eV) and large ionization potential (5.54 eV). The OSCs based on PIT2FBT:PC71BM achieved an interpenetrating bicontinuous fibrillar morphology, resulting in better carrier mobility and a PCE of 9.01% with a VOC of 1.0 V.
 Fig. 10  Structures of asymmetric polymers based on the IT unit. 
The Wang group synthesized a series of polymers based on alkylphenyl and alkoxyphenyl IT units.103–105 They103 synthesized two novel IT-based asymmetric polymers PITPh–DTffBT and PITPhf–DTffBT in order to study the effect of the side chain fluorine substitution in asymmetric IT donor units on the photovoltaic performance (Fig. 10). Compared with PITPh–DTffBT, the side chain fluorination gave the polymer a deeper HOMO energy level and a higher and more balanced charge mobility. Bimolecular recombination was also reduced due to side chain interactions. The OSCs based on PITPhf–DTffBT:PC71BM obtained a PCE of 7.03%. In order to investigate the effect of polymer additive poly(styrene-block-butadiene-block-styrene) (SBS) on the morphology and photovoltaic properties of the active layer blends, they104 synthesized two novel IT-based asymmetric polymers PIT–DTBT and PIT–DTffBT based on asymmetric IT and nonfluorinated or difluorinated BT (Fig. 10). After treatment with additive SBS, the molecular stacking of PIT–DTffBT was improved, with a higher charge mobility, more efficient charge dissociation and collection, and less charge recombination. The photovoltaic devices based on difluorinated PIT–DTffBT and nonfluorinated PIT–DTBT obtain the PCEs of 6.57% and 3.13%, respectively, which are attributed to the improved phase separation of the blended films by the additive SBS. They105 employed IT and 6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)-5,8-di(thiophen-2-yl)quinoxaline (DfQx) to polymerize into two new asymmetric polymers PITPh–DfQx and PITPhf–DfQx (Fig. 10). Compared with PITPh–DfQx, fluorinated polymer PITPhf–DfQx had a deeper HOMO energy level, a higher and more balanced charge mobility, a higher charge dissociation efficiency and lower bimolecular recombination. In addition, the addition of the additive SBS significantly improved the molecular packing and induced crystallization of the two polymers, thus effectively regulating the degree of phase separation between the donor and the acceptor. Due to the addition of SBS, the PCE values of the PITPhf–DfQx and PITPh–DfQx-based devices are 6.60% and 5.50%, respectively. The parameters of OSCs based on IT-based asymmetric polymers in the literature are summarized in Table 7.

3.4 Asymmetric polymers based on DPP
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) is a commonly used unit with strong electron withdrawing ability for the construction of donor–acceptor polymers, which has been successfully applied in field-effect transistors (FETs) and OSCs.1,106–108 Li et al. designed a series of DPP-based asymmetric polymers.45,46,109 They45 synthesized two novel asymmetric DPP-based polymers, PDPPTT–2T and PDPPMT–2T (Fig. 11), with different aromatic substitutes. The polymers have a high molecular weight, small bandgap, high thin film crystallinity in toluene or DPE solution, and hole mobilities as high as 12.5 cm2 V−1 s−1. A PCE of 6.5% can be realized by OSCs based on these two polymers. They46 designed an asymmetric polymer PDPP1 with different aromatic linkers on the main chain, and developed a random polymer PDPP2 as a comparison (Fig. 11). The results show that the polymers PDPP1 and PDPP2 have similar absorption spectra and similar photovoltaic properties. Compared with the random polymer PDPP2, asymmetric PDPP1 exhibited a deeper energy level, higher crystalline properties, and higher hole mobility of 3.05 cm2 V−1 s−1. The OSCs based on PDPP1:PC71BM obtains a PCE of 5.9%.
 Fig. 11  Structures of asymmetric polymers based on the DPP unit. 
Qiu and co-workers89 designed and synthesized two new asymmetric thiophene/pyridine flanked DPP-based polymers, PPyTDPP–TT and PPyTDPP–BT (Fig. 11). Both polymers have a narrow bandgap (∼1.5 eV) and deep HOMO energy level, resulting in a wide absorption range (500–850 nm) that favors low-energy photon capture. Interestingly, both polymers showed good ambipolar semiconducting properties, and as such, both polymers can act as both electron donors and electron acceptors. When PPyTDPP–BT and PPyTDPP–TT are used as donor materials to blend with PC71BM, the PCEs of the OSCs reach 7.56% and 5.48%, respectively. Wei and Hu et al.110 designed and synthesized three kinds of DPP-based polymers with asymmetric thiophene/benzothiophene flanked, namely PBTTDPP–BT, PBTDPP–TT and PBTTDPP–2FBT (Fig. 11). All of these polymers exhibit good bipolar semiconducting properties with a narrow bandgap (less than 1.5 eV) and a wide absorption range (500–850 nm). The OSCs based on PBTTDPP–TT:PC71BM obtained a PCE of 6.96%. Janssen et al.111 reported a series of polymers based on asymmetric thiophene (T)–DPP–pyridine (Py) units, named 2T–HD, TT–HD, T–HD (ran.), 2T–DT, TT–DT and T–HD (reg.) (Fig. 11). The effect of the nature of the co-monomer, alkyl side chains and regioregularity of the main chain on active layer morphology and the performance of OSCs were systematically studied. In 2022, a novel low bandgap DPP-based asymmetrical polymer PDPP4T–1F (Fig. 11) was successfully synthesized by Shin and co-workers,112 which had asymmetrically arranged fluorine atoms and produces better photovoltaic properties than its symmetrical analogues in single-junction and tandem OSCs. The interpenetrating fiber network was uniformly distributed in PDPP4T–1F:PC71BM-based OSCs and a PCE of 10.10% was obtained. In addition, a PCE of 13.21% is realized in tandem-junction OSCs, which was one of the highest values reported in the literature for fullerene-based tandem OSCs processed by non-halogenated solvents.
Hao et al.113 prepared two DPP-based polymers (PDPP–PT and PDPP–PTF2) (Fig. 11) with phenylene–thiophene as an asymmetrical donor unit. Both polymers had a narrow bandgap (less than 1.5 eV) and a wide absorption range (350–900 nm). Compared with PDPP–PT, the polymer PDPP–PTF2 had better planarity, higher hole mobility and better morphology due to the introduction of fluorine. The OSCs based on fluoropolymer PDPP–PTF2 obtained a PCE of 3.0%.
Saeki et al.114 synthesized and characterized two asymmetric regiorandom DPP polymers (PPy and PFBz) (Fig. 11). Due to the contrasting molecular orbital energy levels and BHJ morphology exhibited in the blend films, the resulting PCEs were 3.75% and 0.18%, respectively. In addition, they also performed a comparative study of regioregular and regiorandom DPP-based polymers. A regioregular DPP copolymer (RR–PPy) (Fig. 11) was synthesized via sandwiching the BDT–Th unit by two Th–DPP–Py units in an axisymmetric manner. The inclusion of asymmetry and regioregularity in the polymer results in a larger size, lower crystallinity and orientation, and therefore lower PCE in the blend films. This study suggests that regioregularity control does not necessarily lead to improved performance due to the large-sized unsymmetric acceptors. The parameters of the OSCs based on DPP-based asymmetric polymers are summarized in Table 8.

3.5 Asymmetric polymers based on IID
Fréchet et al.115 synthesized an isoindigo(IID)-based polymer PTBII3T-OD (Fig. 12) with increasing planarity by replacing the benzene ring in the acceptor comonomer with the thiophene ring. Studies have shown that the increasing backbone coplanarity extends the effective conjugation length and charge delocalization, resulting in red-shifted absorption profiles and a narrower optoelectronic bandgap. In addition, highly soluble, planar polymers show a preference for face-on orientation in thin films, while the less soluble, nonplanar polymers favor packing with an edge-on orientation. The asymmetric thieno-benzo-isoindigo (TBIID) copolymers were more soluble than the regiosymmetric IID and thieno-isoindigo (TIID) polymers in all cases, resulting in the improved face-on orientation of the polymers and yielded the highest PCE (up to 4.7%). In 2015, Seki et al.116 designed and synthesized a series of asymmetric polymers (TT1, TT2, BT1 and BT2, Fig. 12) composed of an asymmetric benzothienoisoindigo (BTIDG) acceptor and weak donors benzobisthiazole (BBTz) or thiazolothiazole (TzTz), affording suitable Eoptg and HOMO levels. The 2D-GIXRD measurements showed that the sizes of the donor π-plane and the number of alkylthiophene spacers can control the polymer orientation. Therefore, BT2 exhibits the top-class face-on orientation, and the best PCE of 4.18% was achieved by OSCs based on BT2:PC71BM.

Nakabayashi et al.117 synthesized a novel thienoisoindigo (TIG)–dithiophene alternating polymer PTIG2T by the self-condensation-type direct arylation polymerization of a TIG-based asymmetric D–A monomer (Fig. 12). Due to the existence of intramolecular charge transfer, PTIG2T showed optical absorption over 1000 nm in the thin film state, and the corresponding optical bandgap is as narrow as 1.24 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PTIG2T are −5.08 eV and −3.60 eV, respectively. In addition, the PCE of OSCs based on PTIG2T:PC61BM reached 3.19%.
Shahid et al.47 constructed a series of asymmetric IID-based low bandgap polymers PCI, PFI, PTz and PTi (Fig. 12). Compared with PTi, the introduction of heteroatoms significantly reduced the HOMO energy level, resulting in an increase in the VOC of the corresponding photovoltaic devices. In addition, halogen-containing polymers PCI (PCE = 4.41%) and PFI (PCE = 3.94%) have better photovoltaic properties than PTz (PCE = 1.38%). Liu and co-workers designed and synthesized two novel IID-based D–A polymers P8 and P9 (Fig. 12) with fluorine atoms substituted at different positions.118 When blended with PC61BM and PC71BM, thanks to the good miscibility, preferable nanophase separation and effective exciton dissociation of the blend film, all P9-based OSCs showed a higher PCE and JSC than that of P8. After optimization, the OSCs based on P9:PC71BM achieves the best PCE of 4.23%. The results showed that the incorporated position of difluorine atoms on the IID-based polymer had a significant effect on the visible light absorption properties, energy levels and photovoltaic properties of the active layer. The parameters of OSCs based on IID-based asymmetric polymers in the literature are summarized in Table 9.

3.6 Other asymmetric polymers
In order to effectively tune the morphology, Yan et al.119 designed and synthesized asymmetric polymers PTFB–M and PTFB–P based on an asymmetric donor unit (T–FB–T–M) (‘T’, ‘FB’, and ‘M’ stand for thiophene, difluorobenzene and meta positions in benzene) (Fig. 13). Compared with the polymer PTFB–P, the alkyl chains of PTFB–M were randomly arranged. Although the random structure of PTFB–M decreased the crystallinity and hole mobility, when mixed with NFA ITIC–Th, PTFB–M-based NF-PSCs showed a higher hole mobility and FF than that of PTFB–P. In addition, thanks to the smaller domain size of PTFB–M in the blend films, PTFB–M-based devices exhibited a higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) and JSC. The results showed that the PCE of OSCs based on PTFB–M:ITIC–Th is as high as 10.4%, which is higher than that of PTFB–P (8.4%). This study provides an effective way to improve the photovoltaic performance by adjusting the morphology of the donor polymer in NF-PSCs. In 2019, in order to study the effect of alkylation positions of the lactam-containing polymer on the photovoltaic properties of the corresponding polymers, Wan and co-workers90 synthesized P(O–DBND–2T), P(N, O–DBND–2T) and P(N–DBND–2T) (Fig. 13). It was found that the optical properties, crystallinity, and aggregation properties of the corresponding polymers changed greatly by changing the alkylation position. Compared with P(N–DBND–2T) and P(O–DBND–2T), the asymmetrical structure of P(N, O–DBND–2T) showed a larger dipole moment, which leads to a shorter π–π stacking distance, and the asymmetric structure also leads to the irregularity of the corresponding polymer region. This regional irregularity made it relatively easy for PC71BM to be inserted into the polymer P(N, O–DBND–2T) to form better nano-fibrillar phase separation and less charge recombination, thus obtaining about 5% PCE. The results showed that the asymmetric N,O-alkylation is a promising method to regulate the intermolecular interaction and phase separation behavior of the corresponding polymers. Moon et al.120 designed and synthesized two asymmetric polymers P[DTffBT–TbT(5)]–2OD and P [DTffBT–TbT(6)]–2OD by modifying the structure of the symmetric BDT unit (Fig. 13). They had matching light absorption ranges and energy levels with fullerene and NFAs. Therefore, the PCE of P [DTffBT–TbT(5)]–2OD:IDIC (Fig. 3) and P [DTffBT–TbT(6)]–2OD:PC71BM-based OSCs are 8.5% and 7.6%, respectively.
 Fig. 13  Structures of polymers based on other asymmetric units. 
In 2018, Li et al.121 designed and synthesized an asymmetric polymer named PTQ10 (Fig. 13) with thiophene as the donor unit and difluorine-substituted quinoxaline as the acceptor unit.
The polymer PTQ10 has broad and strong absorption in the wavelength range of 450–620 nm and a deep HOMO energy level. The OSCs with PTQ10 as the donor and IDIC as the acceptor exhibited an impressive PCE of 12.70%. In 2021, they122 matched PTQ10 to the small molecule acceptor m-DTC–2Cl (Fig. 3) and obtained a PCE of 12.14% with a VOC of 0.992 V, JSC of 16.67 mA cm−2, and FF of 73.42%. In addition, a high PCE of 16.67% was exhibited in the tandem OSCs treated with non-halogenated-solvent. Yan et al.123 designed and synthesized three small molecule acceptors o-BTP–PhC6, m-BTP–PhC6 and p-BTP–PhC6 (Fig. 3). When m-BTP–PhC6 with the optimal side-chain orientation was mixed with the donor polymer PTQ10, suitable phase separation and enhanced molecular packing were achieved, effectively suppressing charge recombination, improving charge transport, enhancing the JSC and FF, and a high PCE of 17.7% was finally obtained. In conclusion, with the great advantages of low cost and high photovoltaic performance, PTQ10 is a promising polymer donor for the commercial application of OSCs. The parameters of OSCs mentioned above are summarized in Table 10.

4. Summary and outlook
The symmetry-breaking strategy of donor materials has an important contribution to the development of OSCs. In this paper, we reviewed two kinds of asymmetric donor materials, which show unique advantages in adjusting energy level matching, expanding the absorption spectrum, and optimizing the morphology through the asymmetric structure of the side chain and main chain. The asymmetric structure of the side chain can combine the advantages of 1D–2D, and not only can increase the absorption, but also can increase the solubility, improve the crystallinity, and optimize the morphology of the blend film. The asymmetric structure of the main chain can reduce the bandgap and adjust the orientation of the surface, which provides a good choice for further improving the PCE of asy-OSCs and developing new polymers.
In addition to the efficiency of the solar cells, several key issues must be considered when designing asymmetric donors to achieve the commercial application of asy-OSCs. Firstly, due to the asymmetry of its structure, some of its synthesis routes are more complex. In order to reduce the cost of OSCs, it is very important to develop low-cost asymmetric materials. Secondly, the asymmetric donor is soluble in a green solvent. At present, almost all efficient OSC devices are processed by halogenated solvents such as chloroform or chlorobenzene. One reason for this is that the solubility of polymers in green solvents is usually very low, which results in poor BHJ morphology and poor PCE. However, the reported asymmetric donors can still maintain a good photovoltaic performance without post-treatment or green solvent post-treatment, which is worthy of in-depth study and early realization of the widespread use of green and efficient OSCs. Thirdly, the trade-off between JSC and VOC has always been a research hotspot. High VOC can be obtained with a deep HOMO energy level, but the absorption of light will be reduced with the increase in the bandgap, and JSC will be reduced, which will affect the PCE. Therefore, the key to solving the problem is to use side chain engineering to modify and select a suitable acceptor. Finally, because asymmetric materials break the regional rule and have an influence on the polymer stacking, crystallinity and morphology of blend film, post-treatment technology such as thermal annealing could be employed to optimize the morphology, improve the charge transport, and finally obtain high-efficiency OSCs.
