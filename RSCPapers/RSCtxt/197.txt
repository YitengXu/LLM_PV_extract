    , Accepted 27th April 2022First published on 28th April 2022AbstractOrganic materials with efficient aggregation-induced emission (AIE) are important for optoelectronic applications because of their significantly enhanced luminescence in the solid state. Here, we develop a series of high-luminescence molecules with both AIE and dynamic self-adaptive resonance features by combining the resonance linkage and the AIE-active unit. The prepared resonance molecules show impressive photoluminescence characteristics with a high quantum yield of 84% in the solid state. When employing them as the sensors for picric acid (PA), superior detection performance with a Stern–Volmer quenching constant of 1.33 × 105 M−1 and a limit of detection of 31 nM were observed. The facile resonance variation between N–PS and N+P–S− canonical forms in establishing strong and self-adaptive interactions with PA was found to be the main reason for the high-performance dynamic detection. These results highlight the successful design of highly luminescent resonance molecules, offering important guidelines in the development of new-concept sensors with dynamically tuned optoelectronic properties for self-adaptive sensing.
Introduction
Conjugated organic molecules with unique optical and electronic properties play an important role in the development of high-performance organic optoelectronic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), and chemo/bio sensors.1–9 Organic molecules possessing resonance effects, defined as organic resonance molecules, have attracted considerable attention owing to their spectacular optoelectronic properties and promising device performance, such as the dynamic charge redistribution for modulating the optoelectronic properties by resonance variation in response to the external environmental stimuli.10–13 Recently, we presented a design strategy for resonance variation-based dynamic adaption to realize self-adaptive resonance variation for dynamic and selective tuning of organic materials.14 A series of organic resonance molecules containing N–PX (X = O, S, or Se) or N–CO resonance structures were developed based on donor–resonance–acceptor or donor–resonance–donor architectures.14–18 Owing to the facile resonance variation in realizing the dynamically balanced charge transport, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the blue and white phosphorescent OLEDs employing these resonance molecules as host materials show high values of up to 31.2%18 and 23.5%,19 respectively; the EQEs of the blue and green thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLEDs reach 20.5%18 and 15%, respectively.14 Furthermore, the intersystem crossing (ISC) process from the excited singlet to triplet states can be significantly promoted by virtue of the varied excited-state energies of resonance canonical forms for reducing the real-time splitting energy between the lowest singlet and triplet states, resulting in simultaneously elongated organic afterglow lifetime and improved efficiency.20 Also, resonance molecules are excellent hole-transporting materials of perovskite solar cells capable of dynamic modulating perovskite crystallization, showing high power conversion efficiencies approaching 22.0% and high stability retention of over 90% of the initial efficiencies in air.21 However, in spite of the facile and fast self-adaptive tautomerization, the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of the resonance molecules are quite low, either in solution or in the solid state, greatly limiting their further development for widespread applications.
Aggregation-induced emission (AIE), an unconventional photophysical phenomenon first reported by Tang's group, is an effective design strategy for constructing highly luminescent molecules with many interesting properties.22 Most AIE molecules are non-emissive in the dispersion state but become distinctly emissive in the aggregated state.23,24 We suspect that when the AIE fragment is introduced into the molecular skeletons of organic resonance materials, their photoluminescence (PL) properties would be remarkably improved especially in the solid state, providing an effective approach to improving PLQYs of resonance molecules. Among the various AIE units, tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and its derivatives have attracted significant attention due to their unique propeller structure for strong AIE effects after easy chemical modifications with high robustness in various molecular structures; many TPE-based AIE materials were developed through facile functionalization, exhibiting high PLQYs of up to 100% in the solid films.25–27
Herein, we propose a straightforward strategy to construct highly luminescent organic resonance molecules by introducing a TPE group into resonance skeletons (Fig. 1(a)). Using carbazole as the donor, phenylphosphine oxide or sulfide as the acceptor, and N–PX (X = O and S) as the resonance linkages to connect with the TPE group (Fig. 1(b)), efficient AIE behaviors and high PLQYs (61–84%) were achieved. The AIE-active resonance molecules are further employed as fluorescent probes for sensing picric acid (PA); a high Stern–Volmer quenching constant of up to 1.33 × 105 M−1 and a low limit of detection (LOD) below 48 nM were observed. These results demonstrate the successful molecular design of luminescent organic resonance molecules by combining AIE and resonance features, providing an efficient way to construct highly luminescent resonance materials and high-performance optoelectronic applications by taking advantage of both AIE and dynamic resonance variation behaviors.

Results and discussion
Molecular design, synthesis and characterization
The AIE-active resonance molecules of TPE-PO and TPE-PS were designed by the incorporation of the important AIE unit of TPE into the typical resonance structures of N–PX with apparent N–PX and N+P–X− enantiotropic resonance variations (X = O or S atom); TPE-PS has the strongest enantiotropic resonance due to the efficient N–PS resonance linkage with the lowest activation energy of resonance variation (ERV);14TPE-P without the efficient resonance effect was prepared for comparative investigations. These molecules can be facilely prepared in three steps: (1) the reaction of carbazolyl borate with bromotriphenylethylene by Suzuki cross-coupling gives the triphenylvinyl-carbazole (TPE-Cz) precursor in a yield of 72%; (2) TPE-Cz is lithiated with n-butyl lithium under a nitrogen atmosphere at −78 °C, and then reacts with diphenylphosphine chloride to produce TPE-P (yield: 75%); (3) TPE-P is then oxidized or sulfurated by hydrogen peroxide or sulfur without any catalyst under atmospheric conditions to produce TPE-PO or TPE-PS with the yields of 90% and 87%, respectively (Scheme S1, ESI†).17 Their chemical structures were fully confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high resolution mass spectra (Fig. S1–S11, ESI†). These compounds have excellent thermal stability as determined by thermogravimetry analyses and differential scanning calorimetry measurements, and only 5% weight loss and melting temperatures were observed at 320–343 °C and 211–228 °C, respectively (Fig. S12, ESI†).
Photophysical properties
Owing to the insulating characteristic of PO and PS linkages,28–30 all the AIE-active resonance molecules show almost identical absorption peaks due to the carbazole unit either in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution (∼10−5 mol L−1) or solid films (Fig. 2(a) and (b)). The weak emissions (394–418 nm) attributed to the carbazole substituent with low PLQYs (<3%) in dilute solutions were identified for all compounds,14 while the strong emissions in solid films were observed with a red-shifted broad emission band around 480 nm, originating from the TPE segment.31,32 It seems that there is an efficient intramolecular energy transfer from carbazole in the resonance structure to the TPE unit in the solid state. Time-resolved PL investigations showed that the lifetimes of these molecules are in ∼ns level, suggesting their fluorescence emission feature (Fig. 2(c)). Excitingly, these molecules show the expected AIE features; the PL spectra in THF with different volume fractions of water (fw) exhibit gradually enhanced emission with the improvement of fw (Fig. 2(d) and Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†). The change from the single molecular state to the aggregated state results in significant PL enhancement; and, at fw of 98%, the emission intensity reaches the maximum value ∼400-fold stronger compared to that in pure THF (Fig. 2(e)). Therefore, resonance molecules with AIE units can successfully improve the emission properties to achieve high PLQYs, although TPE-PS with the strongest resonance variation possesses the lowest PLQY of 61% and TPE-P has the highest PLQY of up to 84% (Fig. 2(f) and Table S1, ESI†).

Explosive detection
With these highly luminescent resonance molecules, sensitive fluorescent probes for the detection of explosive PA in water were successfully developed. Owing to the AIE nature of the TPE fragment, the emission spectra of AIE-promoted resonance molecules in THF/water mixtures exhibit intense emissions at around 480 nm (Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S15, ESI†). Upon addition of PA (0–48 μM), the fluorescence was gradually quenched without shifting of the emission peak positions, indicating that no other emissive species were formed during PA sensing.33 The emission quenching can be clearly discerned at a PA concentration as low as 2 μM. And, at the PA concentration of 60 μM in TPE-P, 54 μM in TPE-PO and 48 μM in TPE-PS, virtually no light can be detected. The Stern–Volmer plots of relative emission intensity (I0/I) values versus PA concentrations in a low content of PA are linear, which gives quenching constants (KSV) of 7.09 × 104 M−1 for TPE-P, 9.75 × 104 M−1 for TPE-PO and 1.33 × 105 M−1 for TPE-PS, respectively (Fig. 3(b) and (c)). And, the limits of detection (LOD) were found to be 70 nM for TPE-P, 55 nM for TPE-PO and 31 nM for TPE-PS (Fig. 3(d)), which are among the best performances for PA detection (Table S2, ESI†). It is clear that the stronger resonance variation leads to the higher KSV and lower LOD and TPE-PS with the most facile enantiotropic resonance shows the best explosive detection performance. Moreover, the binding stoichiometry between the probes and PA was explored by using Job's plot (Fig. S16, ESI†). The stoichiometric molecular ratios of TPE-P, TPE-PO, and TPE-PS and PA are 1:0.98, 1:1.17 and 1:1.25, respectively (Fig. 3(d)). These results mean that one molecule of TPE-P or TPE-PO can interact with 0.98 or 1.17 equivalents of PA, while TPE-PS is more efficient, and is up to 1.25 equivalents. The highest stoichiometric molecular ratio of TPE-PS and PA is consistent with the superior sensing performance of TPE-PS.

To understand the mechanism of the high-performance quantitative detection of PA, time-resolved transient fluorescence decay curves of the AIE-active resonance molecules with or without PA were investigated (Fig. S17, ESI†). No changes in the fluorescence lifetime of TPE-PS (3.42 ns) as compared to that in the presence of PA (3.02 ns) were recorded, indicating that the Förster resonance energy transfer should not work here for PA quenching.34 The distribution and energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the AIE-active resonance molecules were evaluated by a combined theoretical and experimental study using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses (Fig. S18 and S19, ESI†). The HOMOs of resonance molecules are mainly dominated by the TPE units, while the LUMOs are gradually distributed from TPE to diphenylphosphine oxide or sulfide with enhanced electron-withdrawing ability. Experimental HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −5.53 and −2.40 eV for TPE-P, −5.64 and −2.51 eV for TPE-PO, −5.66 and −2.53 eV for TPE-PS, and −8.23 and −3.91 eV for PA, respectively. It can be found that the LUMO level of the electron-deficient PA is higher than the HOMO level of the AIE-active resonance molecules but lower than their LUMO level; electron transfer becomes feasible from the LUMO of the resonance compounds to the LUMO of PA, when these resonance molecules are excited and close enough to PA (Fig. 4(a)).35 Therefore, the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process should occur here, resulting in the quenched emission for PA detection.

Nevertheless, the LUMO energy levels of these molecules are similar (±0.06 eV), and are not enough to make such a large performance difference in the PA detection through PET process. We further performed bond order analysis to investigate the resonance-induced molecular changes (Table S3, ESI†). The bond orders of N–P and PX were figured out to be 1.21 and 2.15 in TPE-PO as well as 1.21 and 1.88 in TPE-PS, clearly demonstrating the coexistence of N–PX and N+P–X− canonical forms. With the more apparent single bond feature of PS, the N+P–S− resonance structure should be more significant than N+P–O−.14 The interaction of PA with fluorescent probes in N+P–X− resonances should be stronger than that with molecules in N–PX resonances, considering the lower steric hindrance and more lone-pair electrons on negative oxygen than that on the inside nitrogen atoms. The energy of resonance variation (ERV) between the energy difference of the idealized natural Lewis structures of N–PX and N+P–X− (Fig. 4(b) and Table S4, ESI†) was also calculated by natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. A much lower ERV of TPE-PS (0.99 eV) than that of TPE-PO (2.20 eV) was observed, showing the significantly facilitated resonance variability of TPE-PS driven by the N–PS resonance linkage. Therefore, with these theoretical and experimental data, it is speculated that there are two channels of electron transfer in the detection of PA using the luminescent resonance explosive probes (Fig. 4(c)). The first channel is from the electron-donating carbazole unit to PA, resulting in the quenched fluorescence. The second one is from the negative oxygen or sulfur atoms to PA at the facile interconversion into enantiotropic N+P–X− resonances. And the second channel plays the major role in the detection of PA, leading to the best explosive sensing performance of TPE-PS with similar photophysical and electrochemical properties but the highest resonance variability. The dynamic PA detection of the resonance unit subsequently results in a significant quenching of the TPE emission, owing to the efficient intramolecular energy transfer. This detection of PA using AIE-active resonance molecules presents, for the first time, the dynamic probe of explosives showing both a low LOD and high Ksv. To design this kind of dynamic fluorescent probe, the resonance structure should be employed, along with a strong emissive unit that will respond to the detection behaviour of the resonance structure via energy transfer. A superior resonance structure with facile resonance variation is preferred for fast and sensitive dynamic detection as well as the highly emissive fluorescent unit to report the sensing through significant turn-off of the emission.
Conclusions
In summary, we propose an effective strategy for constructing highly luminescent organic resonance molecules by the integration of typical AIE building blocks of TPE into resonance skeletons. The thus designed resonance molecules are weakly emissive in solution, but show significantly enhanced robust AIE emission with a high PLQY of up to 84% in the solid state. Interestingly, the AIE-active resonance molecules show strong interactions with PA to respond quickly towards PA by a dynamic quenching mechanism through the PET process owing to the facile resonance variation between N–PX and N+P–X− canonical forms, as revealed by the combined experimental and theoretical investigations. A Ksv of 1.33 × 105 M−1 and a LOD of 31 nM are achieved, demonstrating a rapid, sensitive and quantitative probe of PA. These results are highly valuable in the design of luminescent organic resonance molecules, providing important clues for the new-concept and high-performance explosive detection in dynamic ways.
