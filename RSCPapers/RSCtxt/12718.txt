    , Accepted 4th October 2022First published on 5th October 2022AbstractThe rise of organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials as NIR emitters and hosts have engrossed wide consideration as they can demonstrate 100% internal quantum efficiency. These materials have exceeded the phosphorescent noble-metal complexes due to cost-efficiency without compromising the OLED performance. Numerous applications of the NIR spectrum, e.g., in telecommunication, night-vision display, biomedical applications, and chemical sensors, render the NIR-TADF emitters vulnerable to evolution. This review highlights the various strategies adopted in the recent past (2015–2022) to judiciously design purely organic NIR-TADF emitters (λmaxPL/EL > 700 nm) with in-depth discussions of photophysical and device-electroluminescence studies. Approaches such as the incorporation of extended π-conjugated acceptors, diazoles of group-16 elements, ‘BF2’-acceptor, non-conjugated donor–acceptor dendrons, exciplex formation, and TADF sensitization provide effective pathways to construct high-efficiency NIR-TADF-OLEDs. Thus, this review aims to provide a new perspective for the next generation researchers to implement strategies for the thoughtful design of efficient NIR-TADF materials.
1. Introduction
The mass application of NIR light (700 nm < λ < 2500 nm) has enriched the rapid development of research and technology of organic semiconductors that find diverse applications. For example, Apple's patent for a device in which NIR light could be used for fingerprint detection as a security application,1 but this personal identification technique could be extended to capillary vein mapping to diminish identification errors.2 Other applications include photodynamic therapy causing lower damage to the nearby living tissues with longer penetration depths,3,4 biosensing (e.g., blood oxymetry),5,6 short-range (last meter or so) through space communication (TSC) systems,7 and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Realistically, OLEDs are smart alternatives to traditional liquid crystalline displays (LCDs) as they offer high contrast over a wider view-angle, faster response time, energy efficiency, and fabrication flexibility while being thinner and lighter at the same time. Other advantages of NIR-OLEDs include (a) high bandwidth optical Li-Fi (light-fidelity) networking systems superior to wireless (Wi-Fi) systems8 and (b) optogenetics (in vivo regulation of cell behavior by light, particularly on neurons).9 Since the revolutionary work of Tang and Van Slyke based on a double layer fluorescent green OLED device with tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (Alq3) as the electron-transporting and emitting layers (ETL and EML) that showed an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ∼1% with a driving-voltage of <10 V, tremendous research and commercialization have been witnessed on OLEDs, particularly for display applications.10 However, fluorescent OLEDs, such as OLED based on Alq3, can give rise to only 25% of maximum internal quantum efficiency (IQE) according to spin statistics11 where the exciton formation through charge (electron and hole) recombination can give rise to singlet:triplet excitons in the ratio of 25%:75%. The maximum EQE of a fluorescent OLED could rise up to 5% (20% of 25% singlet exciton), assuming a light out-coupling efficiency (ηout) of 20% in Lambertian emission.12 OLEDs based on phosphorescent emitters are promising alternatives as they offer 100% IQE, thanks to the access to the triplet states via intersystem crossing (ISC), which is triggered by the strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC) of the heavy metal center.11,13–17 The seminal work on phosphorescent OLED includes the use of 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethyl-21H,23H-porphyrine platinum(II) complex (PtOEP) in combination with a fluorescent host Alq3, where an enhanced IQE and EQE of 23% and 4%, respectively, were reported by the efficient energy transfer to the emitter from the host.11 Numerous other RGB OLEDs based on phosphorescent materials have then been developed with nearly 100% IQE and moderate to good EQEs (up to ∼33%).18–21 However, the low natural abundance and the environmental contamination associated with the often-used heavy metals in phosphorescent OLEDs enhance the overall cost of commercialized materials. Other drawbacks include the degradation of the device due to the annihilation of the high energy polarons (singlet or triplet)22 and also the dissociation of the ligand by forming unstable radical cation in the complex.23,24
The third-generation emitter that operates by thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) mechanism is the most promising alternative to conventional 1st and 2nd generation fluorescent and phosphorescent emitters. TADF emitters are generally recognized with a small singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) energy gap (ΔEST usually <0.1 eV) where the triplet excitons can be thermally upconverted to the singlet excitons by reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), thereby offering 100% of IQE (Fig. 1a). Thus, TADF emitters typically exhibit a prompt fluorescence lifetime (transition of singlet excitons from S1 to the ground state) and a delayed fluorescence lifetime (transition of upconverted triplet excitons to the ground state from the S1 state after spin-flip). Since the seminal report of a series of purely-organic TADF emitters with an established TADF mechanism by Adachi and co-workers in 2012,25 the field of TADF-OLEDs has witnessed a complete resurgence where highly emissive RGB TADF emitters (λPL/EL ∼ 430–700 nm) with astonishingly high EQE values have been reported.26 However, less reported are the NIR-TADF emitters and fabrication of their OLED devices, which are useful in a plethora of applications; such as biomedical applications (in vivo imaging, photothermal and anticancer therapies), biosensors, surveillance, and the night vision to name a few.27–29 Other plausible ways for effective use of NIR light comprise NIR quantum dots (NIR-QDs) and NIR emitting perovskites. NIR semiconductor QDs with their 3D quantum confinement effect and distinct optoelectronic properties (narrow and symmetrical emissions in NIR-I and NIR-II) hold great promise, e.g., a protease-activatable NIR-II QD composed of PbS/CdS/ZnS (core/shell/shell, λem = 1200 nm) by Jeong et al. showed selective tumor imaging via a colon cancer mouse model.30 In another example, dual-emissive fluorescent nanohybrid (DEFN) as far-red gold nanoclusters with NIR PbS QDs (AuNCsPbS-QDs, λem = 640 nm and 813 nm) exhibited target-responsive detectability of ascorbic acid with excellent photostability, rapid response, and high selectivity.31 On the other hand, inorganic and/or inorganic-organic hybrid perovskites, for example, CsPbI3, FAPbI3 (FA = formamidinium) and CH3NH3PbI332 with a band gap of 400–850 nm show promising application in NIR-OLEDs (the electroluminescence (EL) peak typically being centered around 700–800 nm), NIR-LEDs solar cells,33,34 photodetectors,35 X-ray detection,36–38 night vision devices,39,40 and biolabeling.41 Although intriguing, the NIR perovskite OLEDs typically suffer from trap mediated non-radiative recombination42 with a λEL limited up to 800 nm. A further attempt to red shift the λEL with Sn-based perovskites results in unbalanced charge injection and oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+.32 Also, the use of Pb and Cd is environment non-friendly and high temperatures with prolonged duration is required for the synthesis of NIR-QDs.43 The NIR-TADFs are advantageous over the NIR-QDs and NIR perovskites (a) by providing 100% exciton harvesting facility,26 (b) mechanical flexibility and conformability, typically being purely organic in nature and (c) the associated non-toxicity makes them biocompatible and suitable for wearable ones.44,45

Recent research on SciFinder and other sources (such as Google Scholar) showed only a handful number of NIR emissive TADF emitters and their applications in NIR-OLEDs (Fig. 1b).
The grand challenges associated with the design of an efficient NIR-TADF-OLED are (1) fine tuning of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs and LUMOs) of the organic layers and the emitter itself to (a) regulate the exciton recombination in the emitting layer and (b) diminish the charge injection barrier. (2) Maintain a high photoluminescent quantum yield (ΦPL or PLQY) while red-shifting the emission to the NIR region, which is often directed by the energy-gap law (eqn (1)).46 (1)where ΔE is the energy difference between the excited and ground state potential minima, ωM is the maximum and dominant vibrational frequency, and γ represents molecular parameters.
According to the energy-gap law, with a red/NIR shift of the emission maximum, the rate of the non-radiative transitions (knr) increases rapidly due to the mixing of the vibrational levels of the excited and ground electronic states, which directly impacts the efficiency of the NIR-OLED device.47 Another challenge is that (3) the organic layer materials, inclusive of the emitter, should possess high thermal (for vacuum deposited devices) and morphological (for solution processed devices) stabilities to compensate for the Joule heat produced during the device operation.26 With the progress in the field of NIR-TADF emitters and their OLEDs, several strategies have been adopted to design and NIR-shift the emission of a TADF emitter, e.g., (a) optimization of the donor (D) and acceptor (A) orbital overlap to afford a degree of communication between the D–A (or D-spacer-A) covalently bonded unit to facilitate the faster radiative rate without largening the ΔEST. (b) Introduction of rigidity and planar extended π-conjugation in the A-moiety with strong accepting electron withdrawing groups (EWGs) to induce intermolecular interactions48 and (c) TADF assisted fluorescence (TAF) where the emission energy of the TADF is transferred to an external fluorophore by virtue of Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), and the final NIR emission is originated from the fluorophore.49 Approaches (a) and (b) of incorporating strong and suitable D–A units with rigid and extended π-structures help to decrease the gaps of HOMO–LUMO and ΔEST and increase PLQY (and thus EQE of the device) by prohibiting the non-radiative decay through vibrational and rotational deactivations.50 On the other hand, strategy (c) helps to narrow-bandwidth the NIR emission.49,51 (4) Aggregation induced quenching (ACQ) is one of the limitations in designing NIR-TADF emitters.52 In comparison to organic semiconductors with larger energy gap, well-conjugated NIR-TADF emitters show a higher degree of molecular planarity, thus favoring a substantial formation of poorly emissive (H-type) aggregates.53 Such a problem can be tackled by (1) judicious molecular designing54 or by tethering the emitter into cyclodextrin rings resulting in conjugated polyrotaxanes,55 (2) dilution in a solid-state matrix (acting as quenching inhibitor and a charge transport agent) either through solution or vacuum processing,56 (3) copolymerization with a polymer host with a wider bandgap, thus in turn leading to reduced phase segregation.57
The EQE could further be enhanced by the effective horizontal orientation of the emitting transition dipole moments (TDMs) and recombination and balanced charge transport in the EML. It has also been observed that a highly twisted D–A structure is not crucial for NIR-shifting the emission; in some cases, unprecedented NIR-shift is also observed with a compensatory through-space intermolecular interaction effect between adjacent molecules.58 Since the donor has a limited role in designing a NIR-TADF emitter,47,59 this review comprehensively focuses on various designs of acceptor moieties that help NIR-shift the emission maximum without compromising the PLQY and thus help achieve efficient NIR-TADF OLEDs with high EQEs. To separate the deep-red and NIR-TADF emitters, this review uses a NIR luminescence cut-off of 700 nm (700 nm ≤ λPL/EL ≤ 1250 nm, λPL/EL corresponds to photo- and electro-luminescence maximum, respectively). This review does not incorporate any NIR fluorophore without the established nature of a TADF, although their λPL/EL may fall well-above 700 nm.60 A comparative energy level diagram of conventionally used donors and judiciously designed acceptors, as suggested by density functional theory calculations, is also provided to aid the reader design an efficient NIR-TADF emitter (Fig. 2). Recent progress in NIR-TADF emitters and their OLEDs, with benchmark examples along with the pioneering works in green TADF emitters, is included (Fig. 3). In the end, the best acceptor strategies and devices are also summarized and tabulated (Table 1) with a future perspective in the field of NIR-TADF-OLED.

The review focuses on the following strategies to design suitable acceptors to NIR-shift the emission of TADF emitters.
2. Conjugated/fused π-acceptor (pyrazine) with strong EWGs
Acene molecules containing nitrogen atoms, such as dicyanoquinoxaline/dicyanopyrazinoquinoxaline derivatives were found to be useful in various fields of applications, such as n-type semiconductors in field-effect transistors,61 photocatalysts,62 pharmacological activities,63etc. These types of derivatives enjoy the following advantages, (1) the presence of cyano and pyrazinopyrazine groups induces strong electron withdrawing ability, (2) an effective intermolecular interaction due to the extended π-conjugated arrangement, (3) easy tuning of the HOMO–LUMO gap by introducing substituents at the phenyl that would lead to highly polarized D–A structure and consequently elevated molecular packing. However, these advantageous properties have never been explored as NIR emitters until the first organic NIR-TADF was reported by Wang et al. as TPA-DCPP (λPL (CHCl3) = 720 nm, λPL (neat film) = 708 nm), 1, having a V-shaped D–π–A–π–D structure, which was applied for fabricating highly efficient deep-red/NIR-OLEDs.64 In this molecule 2,3-dicyanopyrazino phenanthrene (DCPP) was used as the acceptor due to the presence of large and rigid π-conjugation and strong electron-withdrawing capability, whereas diphenylamine (DPA) was used as an electron donor due to its excellent hole-transporting ability and to mitigate the effect of aggregation-induced quenching. The DFT calculations of the molecule were also performed to study the molecular orbital distribution from which the dihedral angle between DCPP and the phenyl-conjugated bridge was found to be 35° (Fig. 4a). The small dihedral angle suggested a near-planar arrangement and a reasonable orbital overlap, enhancing the fluorescence rate (kF = 9.0 × 10−7 s−1). From the time-independent DFT (TD-DFT) calculation, the ΔEST value was found to be 0.20 eV. Thus, the molecular design proved effective in affording a small ΔEST and large kF value. Molecule 1 was synthesized by the Suzuki coupling of substituted DPA and DCPP moieties (Scheme 1). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of this molecule in different solvents, e.g., chloroform (CHCl3), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dichloromethane (DCM) were studied, and they exhibited red-shifted TADF emission. In CHCl3, it displayed NIR emission (λPL = 720 nm) with associated τF, τTADF, and ΦPL values of 1.7 ns, 9.1 ns, and 3%, respectively. In THF, molecule 1 exhibited more red-shifted NIR emission (λPL = 780 nm) with τF, τTADF, and ΦPL values of 0.4 ns, 4.0 ns, and 1%, respectively. With increasing polarity to DCM, the emission was further red-shifted (λPL = 810 nm). In deaerated toluene solution, at 77 K, the ΔEST value was found to be 0.13 eV based on the onsets of the phosphorescence and fluorescence spectra. This TADF emission was attributed to a reverse internal conversion (RIC) from the π–π* state to the 3CT state, followed by RISC to the emissive 1CT state. The pure thin film of molecule 1 exhibited a broad NIR emission at 708 nm with associated τF, τTADF, and ΦPL values of 20.8 ns, 0.76 μs, and 14% due to the AIE (aggregation-induced emission) (Fig. 4b). DCPP was found to be AIE inactive but with phenylamine as molecule 1, it was found to be AIE active.64 The non-doped OLED device of molecule 1 with a sandwiched structure was fabricated as indium-tinoxide (ITO)/N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine (NPB, 80 nm)/tris(4-carbazoyl-9-ylphenyl)amine (TCTA, 5 nm)/1 (20 nm, EML)/1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi, 30 nm)/LiF (0.5 nm)/Al. This non-doped device displayed NIR emission with electroluminescence maximum (λEL) at 710 nm with Commission Internationale de L’Éclairage (CIE) coordinates of x = 0.70, y = 0.29 and a maximum EQE of 2.1% and luminescence of 591 cd m−2 (Fig. 4c). The EQE of OLEDs was expressed by the equation, EQE = (γ × ηr × ΦPL) × ηout(2)(where γ = recombination efficiency of the injected holes, ηr = efficiency of radiative exciton production, and ηout = light out-coupling efficiency). For a non-doped device, ηr was evaluated from eqn (2) as 75%, which surpasses the 25% limit for radiative excitons in conventional fluorescence organic light-emitting diodes (FOLEDs), which was the consequence of thermally-harvested triplet excitons and was found to be the highest values (∼2%) reported in non-doped NIR-FOLEDS with analogous EL spectra.65 Later, Skene, Cohen, and coworkers further studied molecule 1 in combination with a cyanine pyrrolopyrrole fluorophore, BPPC, where molecule 1 acted as a sensitizer and BPPC acted as an emitter. In this case, the emission energy of the sensitizer was transferred to the fluorophore by Förster type dipole–dipole energy transfer (FRET).66 BPPC was chosen as (1) its emission can be tuned due to the aromatic group that is in conjugation with the pyrrolopyrrole core through the vinylene bridge, (2) a high PLQY value of >50% in solution due to the less favorable excited state energy dissipation as the fluorophore was locked by the boron and nitrogen of both the pyrrole and quinolone derivative, (3) the 2-ethylhexyl chain prohibited aggregation-induced quenching, which could reduce the PL. BPPC itself as an emitter in THF showed λPL = 770 nm with a shoulder at 852 nm with associated PLQY and a mono-exponential lifetime of 36% and 4 ns, respectively. To study the electroluminescence (EL) of the NIR emitter, TADF-assisted-fluorescence (TAF) based NIR-OLEDs (NIR-TAF-OLED) were fabricated by thermal evaporation technique as ITO (125 nm)/1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN, HIL, 10 nm)/TAPC (HTL, 60 nm)/TCTA (HTL, 10 nm)/EML(40 nm)/TPBi (ETL, 40 nm)/LiF/Al (100 nm). The EML comprised of components BPPC (0.4 or 0.8 wt%), 1 (20 wt%), and the host B3PYMPM. B3PYMPM device displayed weak emission from sensitizer 1 with a small but gradually increasing contribution at higher current densities. It was also observed that 90% of the emitted photons were above >750 nm, which was the result of increased overlap between the emission of 1 and absorption of BPPC (Fig. 4d). The EQE of an OLED is typically dependent on ΦPL, γ, total device length, and zone of recombination as mentioned earlier. In view of this, the effect of thickness of different transporting layers was also taken into account for increasing the ηout. The outcoupling efficiency improved from 17% to 23% when the thickness of ETL (TAPC) and the HTL (TPBi) was increased to 80 and 85 nm, respectively, considering the dipole layer was at the center of the EML (Fig. 4e). The optimized OLED with both B3PYMPM and TPBi ternary EML with 0.8% BPPC emitter showed EQEmax of 5.4% and 2.2% for the host, respectively. The devices reported in this work were deemed to be the best reported NIR-TAF-OLED with λEL of 790 nm, EQEmax of 5.4%, and NIR photon content of 90% at wavelength >750 nm (Fig. 4f).

Later in 2021, Zhao et al. reported four novel red TADF emitters DCPPr-α-NDPA, 2, DCPPr-β-NDPA, 3, DCPPr-TPA, 4, and DCPPr-DBPPA, 5, with a strong electron-withdrawing pyrazino[2,3-f][1,10]phenanthroline-2,3-dicarbonitrile (DCPPr) core and electron-donating triarylamine (Ar3N) moieties, e.g., N,N-diphenylnaphthalen-1-amine (αNDPA), N,N-diphenylnaphthalen-2-amine (β-NDPA), triphenylamine (TPA), and N,N-di([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)phenylamine (DBPPA).67 As compared to emitter 1, the improved PL efficiencies of these emitters were due to intramolecular H-bond, which increased the planarity and molecular rigidity. The introduction of a strong electron-withdrawing group DCPPr with an extended planar conformation induced planarity of the TDM. This effect in combination with the effect of H-bonding induced horizontal orientation of the TDMs led to the generation of a large degree of emitting dipole orientation (Θ11) and consequently high ηout. The HOMOs and LUMOs were found to be majorly dispersed on Ar3N and DCPPr core moieties, respectively, with ΔESTs in the range of 0.20–0.24 eV. These outcomes suggested that these DCPPr derivatives might have high PL efficiencies in addition to TADF properties. In neat films, λPL of emitters 3, 4, and 5 were found to be in the range of 702–710 nm with associated ΦPL values from 6–11%. As these molecules preferred horizontal orientation, the Θ11 for the neat films of DCPPr derivatives were found to be in the range of 77–89%. To investigate the EL performance, OLED devices of neat films of DCPPr derivatives were fabricated as ITO/HATCN (HIL, 5 nm)/TAPC (EBL, 50 nm)/TCTA (HTL, 5 nm)/EML (20 nm)/TmPyPB (ETL, 40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al. All these molecules exhibited λEL in the range of 716–748 nm with reasonably good EQE values of 1.0–1.9%, comparable to the recently reported host-free NIR-OLEDs.67 These results indicated that intermolecular H-bonding leading to molecular planarity and rigidity might be advantageous for developing strong TADF emitters.
Recently, Wan, Wu, Fan, and coworkers have developed a novel D–A1–A2–A3 strategy in which multiple sub-acceptors (CN: cyano; N4: dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine; PY: pyridine) were used with an extended π-framework to reinforce the electron-accepting strength of the acceptor for the construction of NIR-TADF material, TPA-CN-N4-2PY, 6. In comparison to the D–A1–A2 based TPA-CN-N4 system, the extension of two pyridine subunits on TPA-CN-N4 shifted the EL wavelength into the NIR region (λEL = 712 nm as 9 wt% doped in mCPCN and 689 nm as 12 wt% in mCPCN for TPA-CN-N4-2PY and TPA-CN-N4, respectively) and correspondingly improved the horizontal ratio of emitting dipole orientation (Θ11 = 85–86% and 75–76% for different doping concentrations of TPA-CN-N4-2PY and TPA-CN-N4, respectively).48 The high degree of Θ11 values was due to the propagation of the major x-components of the TDM vectors that in turn, enhanced the Φout and ηr values but more for the emitter 6. As compared to the traditional D–A strategy and most of the TADF acceptors, as reported earlier, this novel arrangement (D–A1–A2–A3) with extra π-conjugation not only presented more flexibility and variety in designing the TADF emitters but also offered much shallower LUMO level of ∼−3.10 eV as predicted by DFT calculations (Fig. 2). The solid-state structure of emitter 6 indicated a twisted configuration between the TPA and dipyrido-[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine (N4) core with a dihedral angle of 53.6° and short π–π and C–H⋯N hydrogen bond distances of 3.51 and 2.77 Å, respectively. While the incorporation of a linear coplanar acceptor moiety could increase the value of Θ11,68 different types of interactions could enhance the ICT leading to a strong red-shift. To investigate the EL performance, the device was fabricated as ITO (95 nm)/MoO3 (1 nm)/TAPC (100/120 nm, ETL)/mCP (10 nm, HIL and HTL)/mCPCN: 9 and 12 wt% 6 (20 nm)/3TPYMB (75 NM)/LiF (1 nm)/Al. mCPCN was used as the host in the device as it shows bipolar carrier transport properties, which could be beneficial for carrier balance. It was observed that for 9 wt% dopant 6, as the thickness of the ETL was increased from 100 to 120 nm, the λEL was more red-shifted (702 to 712 nm) with record-high EQE values of 22.8% (for 100 nm) and 21.9% (for 120 nm). For 12 wt% doping ratios, the λEL was found to be 723 nm with an EQE value of 19.7%. The increment in the thickness of ETL also enhanced the Φout into ∼41%, which was attributed to the modulation in the micro-cavity effect;69,70 however, with the relatively long-delayed fluorescence lifetime, the device showed considerable efficiency roll-off due to the triplet excitons and triplet-involved quenching processes.
Later in 2017, the same authors reported one more NIR organic emitting material (λPL = 700–1250 nm) with D–π–A structural configuration, TPA-QCN, 7.71 The strategy of constructing efficient NIR organic solids was based on (i) bulky TPA and strongly EWG, QCN (quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbonitrile) with the planar π-conjugated structure were used as the D and A moieties, respectively, in which a phenyl ring was employed as a bridge between A and D. (ii) The D–π–A conjugated structure of molecule 7 confirmed the emission of longer wavelength for dispersed molecules, (iii) the π-conjugation geometry might indorse molecule 7 to adopt edge-to-edge aggregation and remove face-to-face or π⋯π stacking, which resulted in the red-shifted emission and weaker luminescence quenching; (iv) the steric hindrance in TPA decreased the dipole⋯dipole interaction and enriched the emission. As suggested by the theoretical calculations, the center-of-mass radial distribution of molecule 7 and QCN moiety adopted a denser packing in molecule 7 relative to the same in the crystal phase. The stronger acceptor–acceptor (QCN-QCN) and shorter intermolecular contacts were beneficial to the TADF process and red-shift of the emission maxima, respectively. The relaxed scan of the S1 energy potential with D2 torsion angle (0–90°) revealed that when the torsion angle of molecule 7 increased, the adiabatic emission energy and ΔEST decreased simultaneously, concomitant with the previous hypothesis. The 2D angle distribution prospects of D1 and D2 points in the film phase of molecule 7 adopted a more twisted D–π–A configuration, thus further suggesting the strong TADF character (Fig. 4g and h). Molecule 7 was synthesized by the Suzuki-coupling of the substituted phenylamine and quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbonitrile (QCN) through a phenyl bridging (Scheme 1). The PL of molecule 7 was more red-shifted on increasing the polarity from toluene (λPL = 584 nm) to DCM (λPL ∼ 820 nm). In toluene, molecule 7 showed τF of 5.1 ns and ΦPL of 65%, whereas under nitrogen, it showed τF, τTADF, and ΦPL values of 5.3 ns, 943 μs, and 85%, respectively. At 77 K, the ΔEST value was found to be 0.23 eV in the toluene solution based on the emission maxima of the respective fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra. The crystal structure of 7 showed the deep red (DR) emission (λPL = 677 nm) with τF and ΦPL of 45.0 ns and 37%, respectively (Fig. 4i). The neat film of 7 exhibited NIR emission (λPL = 733 nm) with associated τF, τTADF, and ΦF, and ΦTADF values of 14.3 ns, 0.8 μs, 19.7%, and 1.3%, respectively. The 30 wt% doped films exhibited the blue-shifted emission (λPL = 700 nm) with associated τF, τTADF, ΦF, and ΦTADF value of 19.7 ns, 201 μs, 44.3%, and 2.7%, respectively. The OLED structure was fabricated as ITO/NPB (65 nm) (HTL)/mCP (5 nm) (EIL)/x wt% TPA-QCN:TPBi (20 nm) (EML)/(4,6-bis(3,5-di-3-pyridylphenyl)-2-methylpyrimidine) (B3PyMPM, 30 nm) (ETL)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) at various doping concentration of the emitter 7 (x = 15, 20, 30, 100). The 30 wt% device exhibited the λEL at 700 nm (CIE x = 0.68, y = 0.31) with associated EQE and luminescence of 9.4% and 1371 cd m−2, respectively, whereas the non-doped device i.e., at 100 wt%, displayed the λEL at 733 nm (CIE x = 0.69, y = 0.31) with associated EQE and luminescence of 3.9% and 205 cd m−2, respectively.
An excellent work by Wang and coworkers in 2018 revealed the development of a new acceptor molecule dibenzo[a,c]phenazine-11,12-dicarbonitrile (DBPzDCN), for a TADF emitter. This acceptor was chosen due to the fact of strong electron-withdrawing effect, which was thought to give rise to a deep LUMO of the molecule (Fig. 2).72 As a donor, DPA was used, and through phenyl (Ph) bridging, a D–π–A–π–D-type TADF molecule DPA-Ph-DBPzDCN, 8 was constructed. The donors of TADF molecules are generally nitrogen-containing heterocycles of diphenyl amine, phenoxazine, carbazole, and their derivatives, whereas in this case, a C-centered donor was used. Molecule 8 was synthesized by the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of Br-DBPzDCN and 4-(diphenylamino)phenylboronic acid (Scheme 1). From the PL emission spectra of molecule 8, it was observed that on moving from a non-polar solvent to a polar solvent, the λPL value was found to be shifted, which was attributed to emission from the ICT state. At a doping concentration of 20 wt% 8 in mCPPy2PO bipolar host (a dicarbazolylphenyl (mCP) donor with a diphenylphosphinoyl-pyridyl (PyPO) acceptor), the thin film displayed λPL at 705 nm with associated τF, τTADF, and ΦPL of 23.9 ns, 121.9 μs, and 25%. On increasing the doping concentration to 30 wt%, it displayed λPL at 728 nm with associated τF, τTADF, and ΦPL of 25.3 ns, 101.1 μs, 14%, respectively. For the neat film, emission at 765 nm was observed, which was red-shifted than that of molecule 1 at 708 nm, signifying that extending the π-conjugation length of the acceptor efficiently adjusted the emission to a longer wavelength.64 The neat film of 8 showed ΦPL of only 2%, which was much lower than ΦPL measured in oxygen-free toluene, i.e., 91%, which was due to the aggregation-induced quenching in the presence of the extended π conjugation. As for efficient RISC, the ΔEST value should be small and for molecule 8, it was found to be 0.23 eV in toluene based on the respective fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra. The calculated HOMO energy levels of both molecules 8 and 1 (TPA-DCPP) were found to be at similar energy levels but the LUMO in molecule 8 was found to be lower than molecule 1 by 0.28 eV due to the extended π-conjugated system in molecule 8, which resulted in more electron-withdrawing ability and more red-shifted emission value (Fig. 2). For the practical utility of molecule 8 as a NIR-TADF emitter, the OLED device was fabricated as ITO/NPB (40 nm) (HTL)/TCTA (5 nm) (EBL)/mCPPy2PO:20/30/50 wt% 8 (20 nm)/B3PymPm (10 nm) (HBL)/(bis[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridine]beryllium) (Bepp2, 30 nm) (ETL)/LiF (1 nm) (EIL)/Al (100 nm). At a turn-on voltage (VON) of 3.5 V, all the three devices exhibited emission from 708–732 nm and CIE, x = 0.68–0.70, y = 0.70 with associated EQE and luminescence values of 5.53–2.50% (at 1 cd m−2) and 605–258 cd m−2, respectively. The calculated ηr was found to be 57–83% for molecule 8, surpassing the radiative exciton limit of 25% for the conventional FOLEDs; however, the devices exhibited a high degree of efficiency roll-off with increasing current density and luminescence to the extent of 34% of the maximum EQE at low luminance, which was attributed to the singlet–triplet and triplet–triplet annihilations (STA and TTA) due to the long-delayed lifetimes.
In the search for a strongly emissive NIR-TADF emitter and replacement of pricy T-metals PhOLEDs that usually suffered from high-efficiency roll-off due to aggregation-induced quenching and TTA, Jiang and coworkers 2017 introduced a novel NIR-TADF wedge-shaped D–π–A–π–D based emitter, 3,4-bis(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)acenaptho[1,2-b]pyrazine-8,9-dicarbonitrile (ADPC-DTPA), 9. Emitter 9 was synthesized by incorporating two diphenylamine (DPA) donors to an acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrazine-8,9-dicarbonitrile (ADPC) acceptor through a Ph bridging.73 The choice of acenaphthylene derivatives showed these derivatives can be more electron deficient than their phenanthrene analogues, as also supported by the DFT calculations performed by us (Fig. 2).74 The ADPC moiety has more electron-withdrawing ability than the DCPP moiety, as reported earlier by Wang, because of the tendency to form an aromatic cyclopentadiene structure with six π-electrons in the central fluoranthene core.64 Molecule 9 was synthesized by Suzuki coupling of ADPC and DCPP moieties (Scheme 2). The CT character was established by strong solvatochromism of molecule 9 in differently polar solvents as also observed in the previous studies.64 In the neat film, molecule 9 displayed λPL at 756 nm with an absolute ΦPL of 17%, which was vividly improved to 63% when the molecule was doped in TPBi (10 wt%), signifying that the concentration quenching route might be efficiently inhibited in dispersion. The ΔEST value of molecule 9 was found to be 0.14 eV in toluene solution, which was closer to the DFT calculated value of 0.10 eV. Molecule 9 showed high thermal stability with a decomposition temperature, Td = 448 °C (analogous to 5% weight loss) and a high glass-transition temperature (Tg = 166 °C). From the cyclic voltammetric studies, it was evaluated that molecule 9 is electrochemically stable. In order to analyze the electroluminescence (EL) performance of molecule 9, the non-doped device was fabricated possessing a structure as ITO/molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) (3 nm) (HIL)/(NPB, 70 nm) (HTL)/TCTA (5 nm) (ExBL; ExBL = exciton blocking layer)/9 (20 nm)/TPBi (70 nm) (ETL)/8-hydroxyquinolinato lithium (Liq, 2 nm) (EIL)/Al (100 nm). The device displayed a NIR emission with λEL of 777 nm and EQE of 2.19%, which was greater than molecule 1 (λEL = 710 nm, EQE = 2.1%) (Fig. 5a).73 Later in 2018, the same authors further studied this molecule for the highly efficient FOLEDs device with different host materials like TCTA, mCBP (mCBP = 3,3′-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-1,10-biphenyl), and Zn(BTZ)2 at various doped concentrations to diminish the disadvantageous blue-shift in NIR-TADF devices. They showed that the host materials had a huge impact on the efficiency of NIR luminescent materials as they comprise different molecular dipole moments. The λPL and ΦPL values of emitter 9 were also found to be effective due to the solid-state solvation effect that physically perturbed the molecular state of the guests. The best result was evaluated with the bis(2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazolate)zinc(II), Zn(BTZ)2 due to its relatively stronger dipole moment as well as longer RISC lifetime and effectual resonance energy transfer.75 The carrier recombination and transporting processes were found to be mainly at the emitting layer due to the mismatch of host–guest energy levels that caused charge trapping. The device was fabricated as ITO/1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile (HATCN, 10 nm)/TAPC (40 nm)/TCTA (10 nm)/Zn(BTZ)2:9 (10/20 wt%, 20 nm)/TPBi (60 nm)/Li (2 nm)/Al (100 nm). The device showed NIR λEL and a good EQE (at 1 mA cm−2) value of 710 nm and 7.8% (for 10 wt% 9) and 728 nm and 5.1% (for 20 wt% 9), respectively. A low driving voltage (2.98–3.21 V at 5 mA cm−2) of the device was observed due to the efficient charge trapping and charge injection from the transporting layers.

In 2019, Brønsted, Congrave, and coworkers reported a simple design strategy for TDAF towards 1000 nm.59 They proposed that although high donor and acceptor strengths are required for an efficient NIR-TADF, the integration of multiple donors is sometimes ineffectual at red-shifting the emission. This is because these donors are not electronically coupled, and also the strength of the acceptor is suppressed by the net donor strength, compromising any red shift. They designed a simple D–A based dyad CAT-1, 10, using DFT/TD-DFT (B3LYP/6-31G*) calculations in which one of the substituted amine groups was replaced by a proximal cyano group that is directly conjugated via the pyrazine moiety increasing the overall accepting strength of the molecule 10 (Scheme 2). In comparison to structurally analogous emitter 9 (ΔEST = 0.14, λPL = 756 nm, λEL = 777 nm), where two TPA moieties acted as the donors, one TPA donor had been replaced with an electron withdrawing cyano acceptor, resulting in a great enhancement in the acceptor strength and stabilizing ICT to achieve unprecedently red-shifted PL as compared to that of molecule 9.73 A narrow ΔEST and oscillator strength associated with S0 → S1 values of 0.11 eV and 0.1052, respectively, was found to be due to the phenyl spacer—acceptor dihedral angle of 61°. Emitter 10 was synthesized by Suzuki coupling, which could be performed on a multigram scale with minimal chromatography (Scheme 2). From the PL data, it was observed that in toluene solution, molecule 10 exhibited broad and unstructured emission in the NIR region at 770 nm with a ΦPL value of 3.9%. The 10 wt% 10 doped film in 4,4′-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-1,10-biphenyl (CBP) exhibited emission at 763 nm with associated τF, τTADF, and ΦPL of <5 ns, 80 μs, and 8.8%, respectively. A temperature-dependent fluorescence intensity, quenching of fluorescence in the presence of oxygen and experimentally observed ΔEST value of 0.04 eV indicated the contribution from the triplet state in the TADF mechanism of the 10 wt% doped films. At a 40 wt% dopant concentration, emission was bathochromically shifted to 820 nm with sacrificing the ΦPL to 1.98%. However, the TADF component was found to be present with a τTADF value of 8 μs with a 5.1% contribution. In neat evaporated films, it led to further bathochromic shift with λPL of 887 nm and ΦPL of 0.18%, which was attributed to the effects of aggregation and solvatochromism. However, for the drop cast film of 10 in chlorobenzene, λPL was found to be even more red-shifted to 950 nm with a negligible ΦPL value of ≤0.18%. The X-ray diffraction of the thin-film indicated an extent of solid-state-ordering induced enriched aggregation. Thus, emitter 10 displayed all emission values above 700 nm as ‘real’ NIR. The EL performance of compound 10 was further evaluated in a thermally evaporated non-doped OLED device fabricated as ITO/TAPC (HTL, 40 nm)/CBP:10 (EML, 20 nm)/TPBi (EBL, 40 nm)/Al (100 nm)/LiF (1 nm). It displayed an impressively NIR-shifted λEL at 904 nm (Fig. 5b). The red-shift in the non-doped EL as compared to thin-film was attributed to the exciton formation by a diffusional process in the device instead of direct photoexcitation or possibly another fact of optical interference. Although the EQE and radiance values were found to be low at ∼0.019% and 1 × 103 mW sr−1 m−2, the data indicated the favorable long-wavelength PL of a neat film of emitter 10 can be reserved in an EL device that is bathochromically competitive with conventional fluorescent and phosphorescent devices. Recently the same group of authors reported another NIR-TADF emitter CAT-TPE, 11, which was found to be advantageous compared to emitter 10 due to the fabrication of a solution-processable device with 11.76 As proven earlier, fused extended polycyclic electron acceptors were useful in establishing efficient NIR-TADFs,59 and emitter 11 was designed accordingly, which was structurally similar to 10, the difference being the TPE (tetraphenylethylene) fused TPA moiety was used as the donor in 11. The TPE incorporation introduced not only good solubility and AIE behavior leading to an AIR luminophore but also provided good electrochemical stability that prohibited the dimerization of TPA radical cations. In 5–40 wt% doped TPBi film, emitter 11 displayed λPL of 752–842 nm with associated ΦPL of 0.64–11.3% whereas in the pristine drop-cast film, the λPL was much red-shifted to 961 nm with low ΦPL value of <0.64%, as a combined outcome of aggregation and solvatochromism. As compared to emitter 10, the red-shifted nature was not sacrificed, on top, the ΦPL values in different doping concentrations were found to be higher for emitter 11. Emitter 11 was found to exhibit excellent AIE behavior where the maximum CT intensity was recorded at 70 vol% water, and solvent polarity quenching was observed at lower water fractions (Fig. 5c). To the best of the author's knowledge, 11 was the first time reported all-NIR-TADF emitter (all CT > 700 nm) that was found to be more emissive in the aggregated from as compared to the solution. The 15 wt% solution-processed device exhibited no-host emission with λEL at 720 nm and EQEmax = 0.8% with reasonable EQE roll-off up to 0.4% at a current density of 50 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5d). Thus, this study opens the possibility of using AIE-NIR-TADF emitters by reducing the NIR decays.
In search of organic dyes to concurrently stabilize excited states, reduce the non-radiative decay rate, and induce efficient NIR-TADF properties, in 2019, Qiao et al. presented a novel and ubiquitous approach for organic dyes that led to the formation of J-aggregates by strong intermolecular CT.77 To acquire the desired J-aggregates (θ < 54.7°, θ is the slip angle of the dimer), two donor–acceptor type monomers, TPAAP, 12 and TPAAQ, 13, were defined in which electron acceptor acenaptho[1,2-b]pyrazine-8,9-dicarbonitile (AP) and acenaptho[1,2-b]quinoxaline-8,9-dicarbonitrile (AQ) with a strong donor TPA was used (Fig. 6a and b). Both molecules 12 and 13 were synthesized in three steps, including bromination followed by palladium-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction and subsequently the cyclization reaction. The author proposed that a substantial reduction of ΔEST could be achieved by the splitting of pristine singlet exciton states in J-aggregate that gave rise to the lower-energy and dipole-allowed excitons states with larger TDM, while the pristine triplet exciton states were nearly unaffected because of negligibly small TDM. Theoretical calculation of the electrostatic potential maps of molecules 12 and 13 predicted that in the AP and AQ subunits, both the nitrile group and nitrogen atoms comprised the negative electrostatic potential, which resulted in an inclined (staircase) molecular packing along with the electronegative units in proximity to the electropositive parts in the crystalline states (Fig. 6c). Molecules 12 and 13 were found to be CT fluorescent in the yellow to the orange-red region (λPL = 560–609 nm) and acted only as TADF emitters when doped in TPBi (doping concentration 1–100%). Since the scope of this review is only the TADF emitters with λPL/EL ≥ 700 nm, the doping concentrations of 15–100% and only 100% for the J-aggregates of 12 and 13 are considered here. The J aggregates of 12 and 13 in the neat film showed significantly NIR-shifted PL spectra having emission (λPL = 777 nm) with associated τF, τTADF, ΦF, and ΦTADF of 18.4 ns, 10.4 μs 18.6%, and 1.72%, respectively (for 12) and emission (λPL = 716 nm) with associated τF, τTADF, ΦF, ΦTADF, of 22.7 ns, 8.12 μs, 10.9%, and 5.40% (for 13), respectively. The 15 wt% doped films of 12:TPBi exhibited λPL at 704 nm with associated τF, τTADF, ΦF, and ΦTADF of 16.1 ns, 258 μs, 64.1%, and 5.41%, respectively. To illustrate the exciton states of molecules 12 and 13, a Frenkel Exciton–CT exciton (FE-CTE) model was suggested to define the distinctive photophysical nature of aggregates; the lower-energy FE state was dipole-allowed with strong CT nature in the J-type dimer according to the FE model and CTE was due to the string intermolecular interaction amongst donor and acceptor from the adjacent molecules (Fig. 6d). For the evaluation of the electroluminescent performance of J-aggregates of 12 and 13, the OLEDs devices were fabricated as ITO/HATCN (HIL, 5 nm)/NPB (HTL, 70 nm)/(TCTA) (ExBL, 5 nm)/12 or 13 (EML, 30 nm)/TPBi (EBL, 40 nm)/LiF (EIL, 1nm)/Al (150 nm). The non-doped OLED devices of molecules 12 and 13 displayed strong NIR emissions, λEL at 765 nm and 711 nm, with a maximum EQE value of 5.1 and 3.5%, respectively. The 15 wt% doped devices of 12 exhibited λEL at 700 nm and a maximum EQE of 14.1%.

Later, in 2020, the same authors reported the first NIR-II TADF emitter (λPL = 1010 nm) via intermolecular charge transfer aggregation (CTA). For emission in the NIR-II region, stronger CT was required. In this context, emitter 14, 3-(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrazino[2,3-e]pyrazine-9,10-dicarbonitrile (TPAAZ) was synthesized by Suzuki coupling of a planar and stronger electron acceptor acenaptho[1,2-b]pyrazino[2,3-e]pyrazine-9,10-dicarbonitrile (AZ) to a strong electron donor triphenylamine (TPA) to improve the intermolecular CT and comprehend a red shift in emission (Fig. 6e).78 The structure of compound 14 is similar to 12, the difference being the insertion of an extra pyrazine ring in 14 that leads to a significant decrease in the LUMO level (0.7 eV) compared to that of 12, leading to a narrower HOMO–LUMO gap in 14 (Fig. 2). Compound 14 displayed emission at 742 nm (τF = 3.55 ns), which was more red-shifted by 133 nm as compared to that of molecule 12 reported earlier.77 Molecule 14 was further doped in CBP with different doping concentrations to study the photophysical property as J-aggregate. For 1 and 10 wt% doped films, it exhibited emission (λPL = 717 nm) with associated τF, τTADF, ΦF, and ΦTADF values of 10.93 ns, 167.9 μs, 2.45%, and 8.25%, respectively, (for 1 wt%) and λPL at 810 nm with associated τF, τTADF, ΦF, and ΦTADF of 4.61 ns, 3.77 μs, 0.58%, and 3.6%, respectively (for 10 wt%). The neat film of compound 14 showed λPL at 1009 nm. The redshift in the emission value was attributed to the charge transfer aggregation (CTA). For the evaluation of electroluminescence properties, OLEDs were fabricated with structure as ITO (cathode)/HATCN (5nm) (HIL)/TAPC (60 nm) (HTL)/TCTA (5 nm) (ExBL)/x wt% 14:CBP (x = 1 or 100) (EML)/B3PYMPM (60 nm) (ETL)/LiF (1 nm) (EIL)/Al (150 nm) (anode). The 1 wt% 14 doped devices showed λEL at 722 nm with a maximum EQE of 1.35%. The non-doped device with the same device structure exhibited λEL at 1010 nm, which is in line with neat film PL albeit with the maximum EQE of 0.003%. The current density in the non-doped device increased at a much faster rate as compared to the doped one, which was attributed to the better charge injection or transportation ability in the pure film of molecule 14. Thus, the study established that the NIR-II TADF-OLED can be achieved by fabricating a non-doped device that shows a high degree of CTA.
In the previous studies, research works have been focused on modifying the acceptor group either with strong electron-withdrawing substituents or rigid-π conjugation structure to induce NIR-I/II emissions. A novel work by Jang and coworkers in 2020 revealed the incorporation of a substituted spiro donor to afford a NIR-TADF emitter 3-(4-(9,9′-spirobi(fluorene)-3-yl(phenyl)acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrazine-8,9-dicarbonitriule (SDPA-ADPC), 15. The emitter was synthesized by the Suzuki coupling of a boronic ester of 3-(4-(9,9′-spirobi(fluorene)-2-amine (SDPA) with an electron-withdrawing unit acenaphthol[1,2-b]pyrazine-8,9-dicarbonitrile (ADPC) (Fig. 6f). Due to the electron-donating ability of the SDPA donor, molecule 15 showed a narrower band-gap of 1.8 eV as evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. Molecule 15 showed near-unity PLQY in non-polar solvents and small singlet–triplet energy ΔEST values of 0.11 eV.79 The neat film displayed λPL of 758 nm with τF, τTADF, and ΦPL of 4.35 ns, 9.37 μs, and 15%, respectively. For the analysis of EL property of 15, doped and non-doped OLED devices were fabricated as ITO (cathode)/(MoO3) (2.5 nm) (HIL)/(TAPC) (30 nm) (HTL)/(TCTA) (10 nm) (ExBL)/CBP: 15 50/100%, 20 nm)/B3PyMPM (60 nm) (ETL)/8-hydroxyquinolato lithium (Liq, 2 nm) (EIL)/Al (120 nm) (anode). At ∼3 V, with a radiance of 100 mW sr−1 m2, the 50 wt% doped and non-doped devices exhibited λEL at 728 and 782 nm with an EQE value of 5.05 and 2.55%.
In 2021, Lin, Wang, Fin, and coworkers theoretically studied the design of the highly efficient NIR-TADF molecule DA-p-CNPPz, 16 and also verified the design principle by experimental methods. In this molecule 8b,14a-dihydro-4,5,9,14-tetraazabenzo[b]triphenylene-10,13-dicarbonitrile (p-CNBPz) and phenyl-di-p-tolyl-amine (DA) acted as an electron acceptor and donor, respectively (Fig. 7a).80 The molecule was synthesized by the same method as reported earlier by Tao in 2014.81 Using a multiscale method in combination with the thermal vibration correlation function (TVCF) method, the photophysical property of compound 16 in both toluene and amorphous state was speculated. Theoretically (PBE0-1/3/6-31g*), it was predicted that compound 16 should display a λPL value of 757 nm with ΦF = 7.55%, whereas experimentally in toluene, this NIR-TADF emitter (ΔEST = 0.13 eV) exhibited λPL at 730 nm with τF, τTADF, and ΦF values of 3.2 ns, 11.2 μs, and 20%, respectively. The ΦF in toluene solution was found to be the highest reported ΦF in toluene above 700 nm and was due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the p-CNBPz moiety (Fig. 2). In amorphous form, molecule 16 was predicted to exhibit λPL at 930 nm with ΦF of 1.14% (molecular dynamics (MD) – GROMACS). The adiabatic excitation energy of the low lying S1 and T2 states were calculated to be at similar energy levels (ΔES1–T2 = 0.021 eV and ΔES1–T1 = 0.25 eV), whereas in an amorphous state, the energy of S1 was reduced (ΔES1–T2 = 0.276 eV and ΔES1–T1 = 0.020 eV) due to aggregation. The change in the transition property could also be due to the change in the D–A dihedral angle by about 50–60° for the molecule changing from the toluene to the different surrounding environments in the amorphous state. The reason for the low calculated ΦF in the amorphous state (1.14%) as compared to toluene (7.55%) was attributed to the decrease in the radiation rate of the former. The interaction between each molecule in the amorphous state and toluene is shown in Fig. 7b. Due to the planar structure of the π-conjugated acceptor in amorphous-1, a strong π–π acceptor-aggregation with high interaction energy of −112.28 kJ mol−1 was predicted; however, in amorphous-2, -3, -4 forms, CH–π interaction dominated to give rise to donor-edge stacking with average interaction energy of 39.72 kJ mol−1. Unfavorable rapid non-radiative decay was also predicted due to the flexibility of the dihedral angle between D and A in the disorder stacking mode, which led to a decrease in the radiation rate in the amorphous form compared to the same in toluene.

Adachi has shown a significant amount of contribution to the synthesis of TADF emitters and their applications in OLED devices. Recently in 2021, in search for low-efficiency roll-off and longer device operation lifetime (LT95), they reported a D–A type emitter, 11,12-bis(4-(diphenylamino)dibenzo[a,c]phenazine-2,3,6,7-tetracarbonitrile (TPA-PZTCN), 17, in which a rigid moiety dibenzo[a,c]phenazine-2,3,6,7-tetracarbonitrile (PZTCN) acted as an electron acceptor with two TPA as electron donors (Fig. 7c).49 Molecule 17 was synthesized by the condensation reaction between N4,N4,N4′′,N4′′-tetraphenyl-[1,1′:2′,1′′-terphenyl]-4,4′,4′′,5′-tetramine and 3,6-dibromo-2,7-diiodophenanthrene-9,10-dione followed by substitution reaction with CuCN. The 10 wt% 17 doped m-CBP film exhibited emission at λPL = 729 nm with associated τTADF (300 K), ΦPL, ΦTADF values of 18.6 μs, 19.1%, and 21.7%, respectively. From the temperature-dependent transient PL measurement on the 10 wt% 17-mCBP film, the TADF nature (ΔEST = 0.10 eV) was established with a long-delayed fluorescence lifetime of 18.6 μs and also with microsecond regime τTADF values at the high-temperature region (200–300 K). The calculated kRISC value of 7.6 × 104 s−1 for the 10 wt% doped films at 300 K was found to be one order of magnitude higher than the previously reported analogous compounds, TPA-PZCN (9.2 × 103 s−1) (TPA-PZCN = 11,12-bis(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)dibenzo[a,c]phenazine-3,6-dicarbonitrile),82 and 12 (8.3 × 103 s−1).77 The contribution of electron density in the HOMO and LUMO of molecule 17 is shown in Fig. 7d. An increase in overlap integral (IH/L) between the highest occupied NTO (HONTO) and the lowest unoccupied NTO (LUNTO) was observed in the T2 state, indicating the latter achieved a hybrid local-CT character (3HLCT2). The calculation predicted that the spin-flip event was effectual not only by small ΔEST but also by the energetically close T2 state through the equilibrium 3HLCT2 ⇌ 3CT2 ⇌ 1CT1. In order to illustrate the proof-of-concept deeper-NIR-sensitization, emitter 17 was used as an energy sensitizer with a deeper NIR fluorophore 4,8-bis[4-(N,N-diphenylamino)phenyl]benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (BBT-TPA), which exhibited no TADF activity but PLQY of 7.4% in solution. The deeper NIR fluorophore when doped with emitter 17 shows a red-shifted luminescence (λPL = 874 nm, ΦPL = 12.9% as 1 wt% BBT-TPA-10 wt% 17-m-CBP). The fact that the PLQY value of this film was greater than that of BBT-TPA (7.4%) demonstrated that there was an occurrence of an effectual Förster type dipole-dipole energy transfer (FRET) and repression of the vibration-induced exciton quenching in the host–guest film, where the emission mainly originated from BBT-TPA. Molecule 17 was used to fabricate both types of OLEDs, i.e., (A) TADF-OLED (without BBT-TPA) and (B) NIR-TAF-OLED (with BBT-TPA as the terminal emitter) comprising device structure as shown in Fig. 7e. These OLED devices exhibited emission at 734 nm with associated EQEmax and LT95 values of 13.4% and 168 h, respectively (for device A), and at 901 nm with associated EQEmax and an impressive LT95 value of 1.1% and >600 h (for device B) (Fig. 7c and f). The angle-dependent PL measurement revealed a high light-outcoupling efficiency of 34% due to the horizontal orientation of the TDM of emitter 17 in the co-deposited film (Fig. 7g).
In the search for limited acceptor units in the literature in comparison to the resourceful option for donor units and to explore the exciplex based NIR luminescence, Data, Takeda, and coworkers reported a novel molecule POZ-DBPHZ, 18 comprising a new acceptor core di-benzo[a,j]phenazine (DBPHZ) with two phenoxazine (POZ) units to form a U-shaped D–A–D structure (Fig. 8a).83 Emitter 18 was synthesized by the oxidative skeletal rearrangement of 1,1′-binaphtahalene-2,2′-diamines followed by Pd-catalyzed amination with phenoxazine. Molecule 18 exhibited orange emission at λPL = 595 nm as 10 wt% doped film in CBP with ΔEST = 0.02 eV. Essentially the acceptor unit possessed the low lying 3LE, which couples to the donor 1CT to afford the spin-orbit charge transfer (SOCT), consequently leading to effective triplet harvesting by spin-flip. This finding greatly relaxed the design principle for efficient TADF molecules, where it had been previously shown that the locally excited triplet state was commonly associated with the donor triplet (3LED). The OLED device of molecule 18 with CBP as a host showed maximum EQE efficiency of 16% with associated luminous power and current efficiency of 12.4 lm W−1 and 30.5 cd A−1 at a high luminance of 1000 cd m−2 and λEL ∼ 615 nm. Furthermore, the important role of the emitter and host has been observed. A different host material, e.g., m-MTDATA was also tested to observe the changes in the emission and EQE values with a device structure as ITO/m-MTDATA (40 nm)/10% 18 in m-MTDATA (m-MTDATA = 4,4′,4′′-tris[(3-methylphenyl)phenylamino]triphenylamine) (30 nm)/TPBi (50 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) (Fig. 8b and c). It was demonstrated that molecule 18 formed an exciplex with m-MTDATA to exhibit λEL = 741 nm with EQE of approximately 5%. The study revealed that with simple device structures based on the same emitter and different hosts that bring rigid environments to reduce inhomogeneity and prevent non-radiative decay, it is possible to fabricate efficient exciplex-based NIR-TADF-OLEDs.

Hu and coworkers further studied the field of exciplex-based TADF OLED with a novel fluorescent acceptor 3-([1,1′:3′,1′′-terphenyl]-5′-yl)acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrazine-8,9-dicarbonitrile (ADPC-tPh), 19, that showed an experimental HOMO–LUMO gap of 2.75 eV, which is about 1 ± 0.5 eV lower than frequently used OLED materials.84 Hypothetically, the ideal exciplex showed lower S1/T1 than that of constituent parts, which is favorable to the application of excitons. Since the triplet energy of TCTA (2.76 eV) and acceptor 19 (2.11 eV) are higher than the singlet energy (2.013 eV) of the (TCTA:19)-exciplex, at first, TCTA was used to develop the exciplex with 19. According to the exciplex emission rule, the photon energy of 720 nm (1.72 eV) of the TCTA:19 emission was found to be close to the energy difference (1.55 eV) between the HOMO of TCTA (−5.5 eV) and the LUMO of 19 (−3.95 eV) (Fig. 8d). The exciplex-based OLED further demonstrated reassuring PL results (Fig. 8e). This device showed λEL at 730 nm with FWHM ∼ 180 nm, which was broader than the respective PL spectrum and a maximal EQE of 0.09% (at 1.93 mA cm−2). To improve the EQE by efficient exciton utilization through RISC, an OLED with single blend EML comprising 19 was fabricated for interfacial exciplex, as ITO (150 nm)/MoO3 (3.5 nm)/NPB (35 nm)/TCTA (10 nm)/19 (20 nm)/B4PYMPM (50 nm)/Liq (2 nm)/Al (120 nm). The EL spectrum displayed two emissions at 502 nm due to a single component of 19 and 730 nm because of interfacial (TCTA:19)-exciplex, respectively. To further red-shift the exciplex emission devices with various donors, e.g., m-MTDATA and Zn(BTZ)2 in a molar ratio of 1:1 were used. The exciplex showed red-shifted emissions at 945 nm (for m-MTDATA) and 708 nm (for Zn(BTZ)2). Another device containing 2-[4-(diphenylamino)phenyl]-10,10-dioxide-9H-thioxanthen-9-one (TXO-TPA) as the donor was fabricated to surpass the EQE of the device TCTA:19. At 20 mA cm−2, TXO-TPA:19 device exhibited λEL = 704 nm with FWHM at 148 nm (Fig. 8f). With the increasing driving current of the device, the EL spectrum showed a blue shift of 7 nm, which was assigned to the electron-hole separation at the interface of exciplex-forming sites. The device displayed a maximum EQE of 1.27% at 3.4 mA cm−2 with low-efficiency roll-off up to conserved 70% at 100 mA cm−2. The single carrier devices of TXO-TPA:19 displayed an improved charge balance than that of TCTA:19. These results showed the viability of efficient exciplex-based NIR-OLED fabrication.
3. Benzothiadiazole/naphthaselenadiazole based acceptors
The continual challenge of NIR fluorescent emitter is to attain a high value of efficiency of radiative exciton production (ηr) and ΦPL in the same molecule at the same time. This is due to the intrinsic limitation of the energy gap law,46,85 and limited overlap between the HOMO and LUMO, leading to a significantly lower radiative transition rate according to Fermi's Golden rule.86 To effectively harvest the triplet excitons and achieve a high-efficiency NIR-OLED, Qiao et al. adapted the strategy of fabricating the TAF-based NIR-OLED.87 They used a TADF host 1,2-bis(9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine)-4,5-dicyanobenzene (DMAC-PN, ΔEST = 0.27 eV) that showed yellow-to-orange emission with a high PLQY of 20.2%,88 in combination with a novel fluorescent dye TPANSeD, 20 (Fig. 9a). Emitter 20 was synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reaction between (4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)boronic acid and 4,9-dibromonaptho[2,3-c][1,2,5]selenadiazole in a yield of 40%. The crystal packing of molecule 20 exhibited a large degree of effective C–H⋯π interactions rigidifying the molecular conformation and restricting the intermolecular motions. Emitter 20 in toluene and as 4 wt% blend film in DMAC-PN exhibited emissions at 743 nm (τPL = 7.98 ns) and 723 nm (τPL = 9, 20, 700 ns) with associated ΦPL of 27% and 29%, respectively (Fig. 9a). This high photoluminescence quantum yield was attributed to the large HOMO–LUMO overlap, as suggested by the DFT calculations, with a reasonable dihedral angle of ∼55° between the arylamine substituents and napthoselenadiazole moiety. The sensitizing process under optical excitation was confirmed by the transient PL spectra of blend film of 20 in DMAC-PN that displayed prompt and delayed components. The prompt fluorescence lifetime decay value of 9 ns was attributed to the single excitons generated by the direct excitation of emitter 20 (Route 1, Fig. 9b), whereas the same for 20 ns was recognized as the singlet excitons of 20 originating due to the FRET from the singlet excitons generated by the direct excitation of DMAC-PN (Route 2, Fig. 9b). The 700 ns lifetime was due to the singlet exciton of 20 originating from the energy transfer from the upconverted DMAC-PN triplets (Route 3, Fig. 9b). In the neat solid film, the molecule exhibited emission at 764 nm with a ΦPL value of 12%, which was attributed to the enhanced aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) in the neat film. To prove the TAF sensitization of molecule 20, vacuum-deposited FOLEDs were fabricated (Fig. 9c). These devices with 2 (D1), 4 (D2), and 6 (D3) wt% exhibited electroluminescence emissions at 722, 730, and 731 nm with associated EQE values (at 100 mA cm−2) of 2.29%, 2.53%, and 2.05%, respectively. The small degree of efficiency roll-off with a change in the doping ratio was due to the enhanced Dexter energy transfer from DMAC-PN to emitter 20. The value of ηr as calculated from eqn (2) was found to be 45.7% for device D2, which was found to be considerably higher than the theoretical limit of a 25% singlet branching ratio. This is due to the effective RISC in the host DMAC-PN, which in turn is transferred into the singlet state of the dopant 20via Förster energy transfer. Later in 2017, Adachi and coworkers expanded the concept of TAF-OLED using a NIR fluorophore TPA-THQ, 21, in combination with emitter 1.89 The TPA-THQ is structurally analogous to the previously discussed emitter 21 except for the fact that the Se atom is replaced with an S atom. The EL characteristic of the TAF OLED of 20 and 50 wt% of emitters 21 in the CBP host showed λEL at 760 and 780 nm, respectively, with EQE values of 3.3% for both devices (Fig. 9d). The NIR λEL was observed due to the spectral overlap between the emission spectrum of molecule 1 and the absorption spectrum of molecule 21, which is the crucial parameter for high energy transfer efficiency through FRET. The 50 wt% 21 doped TAF-OLED showed high operational stability and a slight decrease in the radial flux of just 2% after 1000 h with a high current density of 100 mA cm−2. This high operational stability is probably due to the expansion of the carrier recombination zone into the bulk of EML, in addition to the separation of the carrier recombination sites and exciton formation area. The 50 wt% 21 doped TAF-OLED was used for sensing the variation of oxygen in hemoglobin for advantageous reasons (1) flexibility of the device in comparison to commonly known rigid devices made of photodiodes and inorganic LEDs, (2) harmless operation to the human tissues in the presence of the scattered NIR light than more harmful visible light and (3) high-cost efficiency due to the involvement of purely organic emitters. By using this NIR-TAF OLED as a light source, the variation of hemoglobin oxygen saturation can be sensed. A photodiode and NIR-OLED were set up on the forearm of a volunteer as shown in Fig. 9e. Through the irradiation window, the incident NIR light was scattered in the arm of a volunteer, and during a cycle of compression and release of the upper arm, the signal variation due to the absorbance of deoxyhemoglobin (at 760 nm) was detected (Fig. 9f).

Based on the similar acceptor skeleton used by Qiao and Adachi et al., Promarak and coworkers reported an efficient NIR-TADF emissive molecule TPACNBz, 22, with a D–A–D type system where a strong electron-deficient moiety 5,6-dicyano[2,1,3]benzothiadiazole (CNBz) and TPA acted as an efficient electron acceptor and donor, respectively, to establish a considerably strong D–A interaction.90 Emitter 22 was synthesized in two steps, firstly by the Suzuki coupling of substituted phenyl boronic acid and benzothiadiazole, followed by the nucleophilic substitution with CN−. The optimized geometry of emitter 22 embraced a dihedral angle of 46° between the nearby phenyl rings of TPA and the benzothiadiazole acceptor. The optimal dihedral angle allowed a sensible HOMO–LUMO orbital overlap, affording an experimental ΔEST value of 0.06 eV and an enhanced radiative decay. The PL spectrum of molecule 22 in ethyl acetate showed emission at 753 nm, whereas in the neat film, the λPL value was found to be at 750 nm (Fig. 9g) with associated τF and ΦF of 5 ns and 21% whereas in 30 wt% dilute film of emitter 22 in CBP, it showed emission at 710 nm with associated τF, τTADF and ΦF of 7 ns, 1520 ns, and 52%, respectively. The more than twice increment in the ΦF value in the doped film compared to that in the neat film was attributed to the ACQ. The cyclic voltammetric plot indicated a quasi-reversible event at 0.99 V corresponding to the radical cation of TPA donor and two quasi-reversible reduction events at −0.99 V and −0.69 V, attributed to the radical anions of CN substituent and the benzothiadiazole acceptor, respectively. Oxidative coupling of the TPA radical cation on the surface of the working electrode to form a dimer molecule and consequently polymerization during multiple CV scans at a potential of 0.87 V was evident (Fig. 9h). The electroluminescent device of molecule 22 showed outstanding results with λEL at 712 nm, CIE coordinates (x = 0.68, y = 0.29), a high maximum radiance of 10020 mW sr−1 m−2 and an EQE of 6.57% (Fig. 9i). The EL spectra maintained the same shape and peak position with varying voltage from 9 to 19 V, indicating the high stability of the EL device where the charge recombination takes place only within the EML. From the results obtained in this study, it was evaluated that CNBz could be an alternative and better choice for strong electron-deficient building blocks for accumulating low bandgap organic semiconducting materials for organic-electronic applications.
4. Role of ‘BF2’ based Lewis-acid acceptors in TAF OLED and ASE
So far, the literature survey has witnessed the conjugated/substituted benzothidiazole and 2,3-dicyanopyrazino phenanthrene moieties as acceptors, while there is a dearth of the Lewis-acid based acceptor. The seminal work of Beverina and co-workers illustrated the use of diketopyrrolopyrrole-boron dyes where BF2 plays the role of a strong electron acceptor. Although not TADF, the OLED device containing diketopyrrolopyrrole-boron dyes showed an EQE of 0.5% at 760 nm.91 Similarly, hemicurcuminoid BF2 derivatives could be used as NIR-to-NIR solid state fluorophores92 and nanoparticles,93 which find applications in living-cell imaging. This, in combination with the fact that the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) is rarely reported for TADF OLEDs. Aléo and coworkers synthesized a novel hemicurcuminoid molecule hTPABF2, 23 in which TPA and acetylacetonate boron difluoride acted as a donor and an acceptor, respectively. The molecule was synthesized by a one-pot condensation reaction of benzoylmethane and 4-(N,N-diphenylamino)benzaldehyde in a good yield of 74% (Scheme 3).94 The photophysical properties of the molecule were examined in various solvents. In DCM, molecule 23 exhibited an emission peak at 736 nm, whereas in MeCN, it displayed emission at 787 nm (ΦPL = 0.03%) due to the formation of a more polar excited state. On changing the solvent from DCM to acetone to acetonitrile, the intensity of the locally excited band was found to be increasing in comparison to that of the CT emission. Molecule 23 in a neat film showed ΦPL of 5.5%. For the blend film, CBP was chosen as the host because of its HOMO and LUMO energy levels that fit well with those of emitter 23, thus disabling the exciplex formation and enabling the FRET. At an excitation value of 340 nm, the thin film of molecule 23 with 40 and 60 wt% in CBP exhibited emissions at 712 and 716 nm, respectively, with τF = 0.52, τTADF = 3.21 ns and ΦPL = 19% (for 40 wt%) and τF = 0.47, τTADF = 3.04 ns and ΦPL = 12% (for 60 wt%). It was observed that for both the doping concentrations, at high energy, the NIR emission originated from the monomeric structure with a short-lived emission, and at the lower energy, the same was instigated from the dimeric structure with longer-lived emission. For the evaluation of electroluminescence, the device was fabricated as ITO (100 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (HIL, 45 nm)/EML (CBP: 40 or 60 wt% of 23 (80 nm)/DPEPO (HBL, 10 nm)/TPBi (ETL, 55 nm)/LiF (0.8 nm)/Al (10 nm). With (40 and 60 wt% 23: CBP) as EML in the OLED, the molecule showed the same EL value as compared to their respective PL spectra with EQE values of 0.7% (for 40 wt%) and 0.4% (for 60 wt%). The Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) properties were also examined in CBP films with 40 and 60 wt% doping concentrations, while a narrowing in the spectral line was observed at a high pumping intensity, which was assigned to the spontaneously emitted photons that were wave-guided in the organic layer and amplified by stimulation emission. To determine the ASE threshold for different concentrations, the plots of the output intensity emitted from the edge of the films vs. the pumping intensity were used. The 40 wt% CBP blend film showed an ASE wavelength (λASE) of 725 nm, threshold energy (ETH) of 21 μJ cm−2, and for 60 wt%, λASE = 750 nm at an ETH = 22 μJ cm−2 was observed. It was detected that the ASE threshold increased on increasing the concentration, which was attributed to the decrement in PLQY. The results suggested that the hemicurcuminoid molecule can be used as a promising candidate for high-performance organic semiconductor lasers functioning in the NIR region.
 Scheme 3  Synthesis of emitters 23–26. 
Continuing the study of NIR-ASE with a low threshold in a TADF organic film to use the triplet exciton in an organic laser medium and a with the motivation of a low-cost solution-processable device, D'Aléo, Ribieree, Adachi, and coworkers reported a NIR-TADF-OLED using a boron difluoride curcuminoid derivative, TPABF2, 24, that showed an impressive EQE of ∼10% at a λEL of 721 nm. The D–A–D TADF emitter 24, containing two TPA donor groups and acetylacetone boron derivative, was synthesized straightforwardly with a good yield of 68% (Scheme 3).50 The photophysical property of molecule 24 was examined in various solvents with varying polarities to infer the strong CT character of both the singlet ground and triplet excited states – as the polarity of solvent was increased from EtOAc to MeCN, emission energy varied from 705–795 nm with τF, and ΦF values found to be 0.28 ns and 3.5% (for EtOAc) and <0.018 ns and 0.1% (for MeCN). Photoluminescence was also studied in different concentrations in the CBP host. By increasing the doping concentration from 2 to 60 wt%, the λPL shifted from 706 nm to 782 nm with decreasing ΦF from 59–7.5%, implying the (1) large dipole moment (7–8 D) of emitter 24 in the ground state and (2) presence of dimers in the films (Fig. 10a).94 The quantum-chemical calculations suggested that the TADF mechanism assisted by vibration and spin–orbit coupling involved a large oscillator strength, which was illustrated by the overlap of the electron and hole wavefunctions together with a non-adiabatic coupling effect. The neat film emitter 24 showed emission at 782 nm with ΦPL of ∼3.2%. The influence of excitation on the PL intensity at room temperature and the temperature dependence of the PL decay suggested the presence of two independent channels for RISC ( and ). In order to demonstrate the potential of the molecule, the EL device was fabricated as ITO (100 nm)/(PEDOT:PSS) (HIL, 45 nm)/(2–60) wt% 24: CBP (EML, ∼80 nm)/DPEPO (HBL, 10 nm)/TPBi (ETL, 55 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). On varying the doping concentration from 2–60 wt% in CBP, the OLED showed λEL from 705 to 771 nm with EQE values ranging from 8.41–0.34%. It was observed that the turn-on voltage depended on the doping concentration, which suggested that the exciton was predominantly formed by the direct charge trapping on the guest molecule. With a 6 wt% doping concentration, the solution-processed OLED showed an EL value of 721 nm with an outstanding EQE value of ∼10% at a low current density of 100 mA cm−2 without using any light out-coupling enhancement mechanism (Fig. 10b). The angle-dependent PL intensity measurements suggested a random orientation of emitter 24 in the CBP host, which yielded an optically simulated EQE of 11.3%, which was close to the experimentally observed value of 10% due to the high PLQY and TADF activity (Fig. 10c). The NIR dopant, 24, was also studied further by using F8BT (F8BT = poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) polymer as a host. Although the F8BT host triplets (ET ∼ 1.6 eV) quench the triplets of emitter 24, thereby reducing the EQE to ∼2.2%, interestingly, a clear contrast in the negligible efficiency roll-off at a high current density of 750 mA cm−2 in F8BT compared to that in CBP was observed (Fig. 10d). This is due to the transfer of the triplets of 24 to the F8BT host that reduces the quenching of emission via STA and TTA, leading to a record high value of radiance of 3 × 106 mW sr−1 m−2.95 This TADF molecule 24 was also examined for organic lasers by investigating its ASE properties in different doping concentrations in CBP at a high pumping intensity of 6 wt% CBP blend. The spontaneously emitted photons that were wave-guided in the organic layer were, in turn, amplified by stimulated emission, thus, resulting in a spectral line narrowing. To demonstrate the threshold of ASE, plots amongst the output intensity emitted from the edge of the films vs. pumping intensity were used. It was observed that the ASE threshold decreased from 36.7–4.70 μJ cm−2 with a decrease in doping concentration from 60 to 4 wt% due to the reduction in concentration quenching. Similar to the EL and PL spectra, the ASE peak wavelength can be tuned from 740–799 nm when the doping concentration is changed. As a single ASE peak was detected in each sample, it was concluded by deconvolution that the emission arose from the dimeric structure. This is in line with the 0–1 vibronic shift of the emission spectrum, the low PLQY of the monomeric emission, and the energy transfers from monomeric to dimeric species, and amplification must happen through the contribution of only one of these two species. The transient absorption measurements indicated no triplet excited state absorption at ASE wavelengths under long-pulse photo-excitation. This study revealed the potential of emitter 24 in the realization of high-efficiency NIR-TADF-OLED and low threshold organic NIR semiconducting (quasi)continuous-wave laser. Later, the same coworkers with a motivation of further red-shifted λEL with high EQE and ASE above 800 nm with a low threshold of 7.5 μJ cm−2 reported a new solution-processable curcuminoid boron difluoride dye dTPABF2, 25 comprising the same acceptor and donor parts but with an EWG in the meso position as compared to the ester function in 25 (Scheme 3).96 The quantum mechanical calculations suggested the ΔEST value of the order of 0.3 eV and the SOC between the S1 and T1 states to be 0.13 cm−1 leading to a poor RISC rate. It was concluded that the non-adiabatic coupling effects related to the vibrations of the TPA groups should also be operational for emitter 25, as also observed for structurally analogous emitter 24. Emitter 25 showed positive solvatochromism (λPL = 706–788 nm) on the varying polarity of the solvents suggesting the CT character of the singlet excited state, high ground, and excited-state dipole moments in emitter 25. With the increase in doping concentration from 2 to 40 wt% in CBP blends, a bathochromic shift from 751–801 nm with decreasing ΦPL from 45.2–4.10% was observed due to the influence of the doping concentration on the polarity of the medium along with the formation of aggregated species. The ΦPL values of molecule 25 for any doping concentration were lower than those of 24 by 20–30%, which was due to the electronic coupling between the two curcuminoid boron difluoride backbones leading to a higher extent of non-radiative deactivation.50 A noteworthy wavelength dependency on the PL kinetics was detected that was attributed to the occurrence of both the monomeric and dimeric species. The EL properties of 25 was examined by fabricating its OLED as ITO (100 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (HIL, 45 nm)/CBP:x (where x = 1–40 wt% 25) (∼80 nm)/DPEPO (HBL,10 nm)/TPBi (ETL, 55 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm) (Fig. 10d). On varying the concentration of x from 1–40 wt%, a decrement in the turn-on voltage from 8.6–5.5 V was observed with λEL and EQEmax ranging from 754–796 nm and 5.10–0.30%, respectively (Fig. 10e). The maximum EQE of 5.1% was obtained for 2 wt% doping with an emission at 758 nm. Such behavior was assigned to the formation of aggregate species in the highly doped thin films.50 This efficiency was much higher than the expected theoretical upper limit of 2.25% for a typical fluorescent emitter, which was due to the efficient TADF nature of emitter 25. Like emitter 24, molecule 25 also showed severe EQE roll-off
at high current densities, probably due to STA and TTA; however, all the devices with different doping concentrations show radiance values >1.6 × 105 mW sr−1 m−2. For molecule 25, ASE was also observed when it was blended in CBP thin films ranging from 801–860 nm with an associated threshold value from 7.5–91.3 μJ cm−2 (Fig. 10f). The stability of ASE was found to be superior in a nitrogen atmosphere compared to that in ambient conditions due to the decrease in the photobleaching of the dye. The lost coefficient α was found to be as low as 6.5 cm−1 indicating the self-absorption of the good quality wave-guiding films at the ASE wavelengths. As molecule 25 did not display any triplet excited-state absorption at the ASE/lasing wavelength in the range of 801–860 nm while still maintaining the ASE threshold <100 μJ cm−2, it could act as an outstanding candidate in NIR-OLED and NIR semiconductor lasers under long-pulse photoexcitation.

Apart from the above-mentioned studies, in the field of NIR-OLED, some benchmark works included the application of solution-processed OLED with a much red-shifted λEL of 900 and 772 nm using emitters triazolobenzothiadiazole (BTT)97 and Pt(II) porphyrin, respectively.98 However, these OLEDs comprised fluorescent and phosphorescent emitters that showed an EQEmax of 0.15% and 8.5%, respectively. To achieve highly efficient solution-processed NIR-TADF-OLED that surpasses the λEL of 800 nm with an EQEmax of 3.8% and FWHM of 40 nm, Skene, Cohen, and coworkers synthesized an efficient curcuminoid derivative MeTPABF2, 26 (Scheme 3).51 The molecule 26 was analogous to the emitter 24, except the donating nature of TPA was enhanced by the addition of methyl groups, as reported earlier.50 Molecule 26 showed positive solvatochromism in various polar solvents with λPL values ranging from 750–823 nm with associated FWHM of 103–201 nm and ΦPL of 0–2.2%, indicating the strong CT character of the excited state. A similar bathochromic shift in λPL (746–764 nm with PLQY 41–13%) was also observed with varying doping concentrations of 26 (6–20 wt%) in the CBP host due to aggregation and increasing polar environment. To further red-shift the emission in the doped film, the TAF sensitization concept was used. In the presence of a novel conjugated pyrrolopyrrole cyanine emitter, BPPC-Ph (λPL = 835 nm, ΦPL = 31%, FWHM = 44 nm in CH2Cl2), the CBP:26 (6–30 wt%): BPPC-Ph (0.5–1 wt%) doped film exhibited an efficient FRET from the TADF sensitizer to the emitter leading to all emission peaks ranging 838–846 nm for any doping concentrations. The best result was obtained with 20% (of 20):0.5% (of BPPC-Ph) with a λPL = 838 nm, ΦPL = 15.8%, FWHM = 38 nm, and τprompt < 100 ps, respectively, indicating the rate of FRET was faster compared to that of the RISC within 26. Considering the possible relationship among the charge trapping, concentration quenching, and FRET in sensitized EML, the optimized solution-processed device with a configuration as ITO/PEDOT:PSS (HIL, 43 nm)/CBP:TPAM-BF2 (20 wt%):BPPC-Ph (0.5 wt%) (80 nm)/B3PYMPM (ETL, 80 nm)/LiF (EIL, 1 nm)/Al (140 nm) showed an impressive EQEmax = 3.5% at λEL = 840 nm with associated FWHM = 34 nm, where EQENIR (>790 nm) contribution and fraction of NIR photons (>790 nm) emitted from BPPC-Ph were 3.2% and 90%, respectively (Fig. 10g). This EQEmax was found to be more than three times higher than the best reported fluorescent emitter BTT* (λPL = 840 nm, EQEmax = 1.15%).56 It was also observed that changing the ETL thickness from 50 to 80 nm increased the outcoupling efficiency from 13.6% to 19.4%. Other optimized devices with 1 and 2 wt% BPPC-Ph doping concentrations albeit showed lower EQEmax of 3 and 1.7%, respectively, due to concentration quenching (Fig. 10h). However, a large EQE roll-off was observed in all the devices due to triplet-polaron annihilation and long triplet exciton lifetime. While for these devices, the agreement between the solution PLQY and EQE showed that the exciton formation took place primarily at the sensitizer 26, and the hole and electron transport occurred directly at the CBP-host and the sensitizer 26, respectively, as suggested by the hole- and electron-only transport measurements. Thus, these hyperfluorescent NIR-TAF-OLED with narrowband emission with FWHM of ∼40 nm are deemed useful in color-pure NIR probing applications.
Emitter 24, with a very small bond length alteration in the core structure, led to small relaxation energy, high ΦPL > 50%, and high kr of more than 108 s−1 in a host–guest system. However, a systematic screening of molecular structures by D'Aléo, Mamada, Adachi, and coworkers using theoretical calculation revealed an increase in oscillator strength with a small ΔEST ranging from 0.47–0.55 eV. In this context, they synthesized a novel NIR laser material, TPATBC, 27, introducing thiophene rings (Fig. 11a).99 This resulted in the reduction of the HOMO–LUMO (ΔELUMO–HOMO = 2.2 eV) by enhancing the donor–acceptor interaction and extending the π-conjugation length. The combined fact of the dependency of the Stokes shift of the emitter on the dielectric constant of the solvent (as suggested by the Lippert–Mataga plot) and the positive solvatochromism established the strong ICT nature of the ground and excited states. At a doping concentration of 6 wt% in the CBP host, emitter 27 displayed λPL = 723 nm with associated τF, τTADF, and ΦPL values of 1.1 ns, 147 μs, and 15%.50 Albeit the radiative constant of both the molecules 24 and 27 were the same but the emission at a longer wavelength led 27 to act as a better laser material. The ASE study of emitter 27 in CBP and F8BT in different doping concentrations showed a range of λASE of 805–821 nm with associated Eth from 17.0–28.2 μJ cm−2. The lower doping concentration displayed a lower Eth due to strong aggregation cost quenching. The amplification by stimulated emission in the organic waveguided layers resulted in a spectral line narrowing at high pumping intensity. In comparison to emitter 24, which showed an Eth of 9.9 μJ cm−2 at a λASE = 715 nm, emitter 27 showed a higher value of Eth albeit with a significantly red-shifted (>90 nm) λASE. Since the reabsorption from the ground- and excited-state affect the optimal amplification properties, transient absorption spectroscopy was used to measure the excited-state absorption spectra and to verify the loss behavior of ASE. Emitters 24 and 27 exhibited a singlet–singlet absorption band with a decay lifetime of 2.1 and 1.6 ns, respectively. The degree of overlap between the ground state absorption and emission spectra for 24 and 27 were found to be similar, and the overlap between the singlet–singlet absorption and emission spectra of 27 was significant, leading to a small degree of net gain for the transition to the lower vibrational level of the ground state (Fig. 11b). However, due to intrinsically high stimulated emission cross-section (σem) spectra, the transition to the higher vibrational levels was capable of light amplification. Overall, a strong redshift for ASE originated from the lower energy transition at the next vibration level due to the large overlap with the singlet–singlet excited-state absorption (Fig. 11c and d). As a result, an outstanding NIR laser material with emission above 800 nm and a very low ASE and laser thresholds of 13.3 and 6.2 μJ cm−2 was identified.

The peak intensity of the σem spectra was 3.1 × 10−16 and 2.1 × 10−16 cm2 for emitters 24 and 27, respectively. The peak intensity of the transient absorption spectra was 12.7 and 14.2 mOD for 24 and 27, respectively (b–d are adapted with permission from ref. 99, copyright John Wiley and Sons, 2021). 
5. Role of cyano-substituted furane based acceptor in inducing ICT effect
Apart from the above-mentioned acceptor categories, namely, conjugated/substituted/fused pyrazine, benzothiadiazole, curcuminoid boron difluoride, Han, Xu, and coworkers reported an emitter tBCzTCF, 28 with a D–π–A structure. The acceptor comprised a strong electron-withdrawing multi-cyano moiety 2-dicyanomethylene-3-cyano-4,5,5-trimethyl-3,5-dihydrofurane (TCF) with 3,6-di-tert-butyl-9H-carbazole (tBCz) as a donor to construct a solution-processable emitter, 28 (Fig. 12a).100 In addition, a π-conjugate styryl linker was introduced whose CC bond controlled the ICT effect and also enhanced the solubility. The presence of the cyano group also helped to distribute the LUMO positions to increase the HOMO–LUMO overlap. The dihedral angle of 45.2° between the donor and the phenyl bridge, as calculated by theoretical calculation, agreed with that of the crystal structure, suggesting extended electronic communication between the donor, styryl, and the TCF. The HOMO–LUMO overlap integral of the emitter was ∼0.4, which was found to be higher compared to those of typical CT systems (∼0.1) (Fig. 12b). In the neat film, it exhibited emission at 712 nm with an associated ΦPL of 26.6%, which was due to the inter- and intra-molecular CT in the solid-state aggregation. Host-free OLED device of emitter 28 was fabricated as ITO/PEDOT:PSS (70 nm)/PVK (HTL, 10 nm)/28/bis{2-di(phenyl)phosphino]-phenyl ether oxide (DPEPO) (ExBL, 10 nm)/1,3,5-tri[(3-pyridyl)-phen-3-yl]benzene (TmPyPB, 50 nm) (ETL)/Liq (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). Molecule 28 exhibited λEL = 715 nm, which was consistent with PL emission with a maximum brightness of ∼50 cd m−2 and an EQE of 0.3%, albeit with low-efficiency roll-off (Fig. 12c). Thus, this work provided a pathway to fine-balance the intra-and inter-molecular CT effects and MO overlap to construct a NIR-TADF-OLED based on a novel acceptor.

6. Non-conjugated quinone-acceptor with dendron donors
Dendrimer-based OLEDs are attractive alternatives to traditional fluorescent, phosphorescent or TADF OLEDs as the intermolecular interactions and ACQs between the emissive cores are efficiently reduced, thus ensuring the stable operation of a solution-processed device. In this context and to prevent the ACQ of emission in a TADF molecule, Sun, Jiang, and coworkers reported for the first time two NIR D–π–A–π–D-type TADF dendrimers, MPPA-Cz, 29 and MPPA-3Cz, 30 with non-conjugated carbazole/tricarbazole as peripheral dendrons (Fig. 13a and b).101 The dendrons were connected with the bromo substituted anthraquinone moiety by Suzuki coupling to afford the molecules 29 and 30 in a moderate yield of 40–55%, where the presence of peripheral carbazole moieties and the long alkyl chains enhanced the donating nature of the dendrons. To compare the photophysical properties of molecules 29 and 30, a simple donor–acceptor moiety 2,6-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)anthracene-9,10-dione (MPPA) was also synthesized (Fig. 13c). The DFT calculation suggested a ΔEST value of 0.18 eV for MPPA where the HOMO orbital was mostly confined over the methoxy triphenylamine units, and the LUMO was distributed on the anthraquinone-acceptor and partially on the phenyl substituent. The ΔEST and the HOMO–LUMO distribution of 29 and 30 were nearly similar to the emissive core MPPA and matched well with the experimentally observed ΔEST ranging from 0.16–0.17 eV. Neat films of 29 and 30 exhibited λPL at 715 nm and 708 nm, respectively, whereas the same of MPPA was not detected. This observation suggested that the introduction of non-conjugated aliphatic chain carbazole dendrons would enhance the emission by decreasing the ACQ, thus inducing the ΦPL value of 6% (for 29) and 8% (for 30) compared to the non-emitting MPPA. To confirm the TADF character of these compounds, the transient PL decay of MPPA and 29 and 30 in thin films were studied. The τF and τTADF values of MPPA were found to be 10.8 ns and 0.36 μs, respectively. Molecules 29 and 30 showed delayed fluorescence decays at 0.56 μs and 0.93 μs, respectively, representing that the introduction of the dendrons in the TADF core enhanced the rate of RISC. To investigate the EL performance, host-free solution processed OLED devices were fabricated as ITO/PEDOT:PSS (HIL, 40 nm)/(29 or 30) (EML, 40 nm)/TPBI (ETL, 40 nm)/Cs2O3 (2 nm)/Al (100 nm). Molecules 29 and 30 showed λEL at 728 nm and 715 nm, respectively, with CIE coordinates of x = 0.70, y = 0.29 (for 29) and x = 0.69, y = 0.30 (for 30). It was also observed that at a range of voltage from 7–16 V, device 29 showed very high color stability, whereas device 30 showed a weak blue shift (Fig. 13d). The non-doped OLED device of 30 showed an EQE value of 0.254% at 135 cd m−2, whereas the device of 29 showed an EQE value of 0.064% at 24 cd m−2 (Fig. 13e). This suggested that there needs to be an optimized number of carbazole-ended alkyl chains to fine-balance the effect of ACQ and EQE. At a high current density of up to 400 mA cm−2, the non-doped 29 and 30 devices showed negligible change in the efficiency roll-off. This study suggested the scope of flexible alkyl chain TADF dendrimers that could be improved by optimizing the device structures.

Later in the same year, these authors reported another molecule, MCPP-MCBP, 31 where a bipolar methoxy-CBP (MCBP) was selected (Fig. 13f),102 as the peripheral dendron rather than the p-type oligocarbazole dendron as reported earlier.101 The concept of introducing bipolar self-host dendrimer was earlier proven to be effective in reducing the efficiency roll-off and increasing the electroluminescence either in blue TADF-OLED,103 or in PhOLEDs.104 However, in the previous studies, the device efficiency suffered from the strong hole-transporting ability of oligocarbazoles, thus giving rise to the problem of charge-unbalance. In this study, this problem was overcome by introducing a bipolar self-host dendrimer, MCBP. The choice of MCBP over the other bipolar self-host was to prevent faster aggregation quenching in solution-processed devices compared to evaporated devices under electrical stress (Fig. 13g). The other reason was the high glass transition temperature of MCBP, leading to uniform layering and subsequently higher device performance. Using this strategy, the calculated ΔEST of 0.18 eV, HOMO–LUMO energy levels, and their separation was found to be similar to those of MPPA, suggesting that the introduction of flexible dendrons isolated the emissive core, keeping the energy levels of the TADF core unchanged. Emitter 31 showed emission below 690 nm with an associated delayed lifetime of 0.67 μs, which was shorter than that of molecule 30 (0.93 μs). Emitter 31 was used as an EML in a host-free solution-processed OLED as ITO/PEDOT:PSS (HIL, 40 nm)/31/TPBi (HTL/ExBL/ETL, 40 nm)/Cs2O3 (EIL)/Al (Fig. 13h). The device showed ∼2.5 times higher EQE of 0.62% than that of the device comprised of emitter 30 with a lower turn-on voltage and higher maximum luminescence. The results indicated improved charge injection and transport properties due to the bulky MCPP moiety compared to the same of 3Cz in 30, albeit with a blue-shifted λEL at 698 nm. The extent of aggregation of emitter 31 under electrical stress was investigated by fabricating another device with a 1:4 molar ratio of MPPA:MCBP. The film quality of the MPPA:MCBP device was found to be uniform compared to that of the neat device of emitter 31 as suggested by the more coarse root-mean-square roughness due to the flexible branches in MPPA:MCBP. The device based on MPPA:MCBP exhibited a 12 nm red-shifted λEL of 710 nm compared to that of the host-free device based on emitter 31. However, the maximum luminescence (26 cd m−2) and EQE of 0.11% were found to be lower due to the increased concentration quenching from the intermolecular interaction of MPPA. Thus, these results indicated that the bipolar MCBP dendrons not only effectively reduced the undesired ACQ problem but also improved the balanced charge transfer and recombination at the EML.
Works based on 1,8-napthalimide (NAI) and its derivatives have been proven to construct pre-twisted CT configurations in D–A or D–π–A TADF systems due to their excellent electron-accepting power and high chemical and thermal stabilities. Chromophores with NAI-based acceptors are easy to graft, consequently allowing fine-tuning of their optical properties.105 In this respect, several orange to deep-red NAI-acridine based TADF emitters have been developed that showed high EQE of 22–29% in the range of λEL = 584–622 nm.105,106 With an aim to construct NIR-OLEDs with reduced EQE roll-off Wie, Xie and coworkers synthesized NAI-based D–A–D emitter 2PN, 32, (2-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-5,8-di(10H-phenoxazin-10-yl)-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione), where NABIP (2-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione) and POZ acted as an acceptor and a donor, respectively.107 In toluene and neat film conditions, the molecule exhibited λPL at 755 and 725 nm, respectively. The solid-state structure revealed a dihedral angle of 59.5° between the acceptor and donor that indicated an efficient spatial charge separation of the FMOs and consequently reduced ΔEST. The 20 wt% doped device as ITO/HAT-CN (HIL, 10 nm), TAPC (HTL, 40 nm)/TCTA (HBL, 10 nm)/mCP: 20 wt% 2PN (EML, 20 nm) (mCP = 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl) benzene)/TPBi (ETL, 60 nm)/LiF (EIL, 1 nm)/Al (120 nm) exhibited λEL of 701 nm with an EQEmax of 0.04% albeit with low-efficiency roll-off. Thus, this work opens up the possibility of constructing a promising NIR-TADF OLED based on a relatively simple donor–acceptor structure.
7. Conclusion and future perspective
This review emphasizes the various strategies developed over the recent past for the effective NIR-shift of λPL/EL of purely organic TADF emitters with enhanced OLED device performance. Since the first example of NIR-TADF emitter, TPA-DCPP (λEL = 710 nm, EQE = 2.1%),64 careful design of the acceptor moiety with extended π-conjugated structure has led to evolution of some champion emitters, e.g., TPA-CN-N4-Py (λEL = 712 nm, EQE = 21.9%),48 TPA-PZTCN (λEL = 734 nm, EQE = 1.1%),49 and TPAAP (λEL = 765 nm, EQE = 5.1%).77 The strategies of exciplex emission and resonance energy transfer also proved to be effective in enhancing the exciton utilization and improving the device performance; examples include POZ-DBPHz/m-MTDATA exciplex (λEL = 741 nm, EQE = 5.0%),83 TPA-PZTCN (sensitizer) + BBT-TPA (NIR fluorophore) (λEL = 901 nm, EQE = 1.1%, TAF).49 The approach of using a conjugated benzothiadiazole acceptor (TPACNBZ, λEL = 712 nm, EQE = 6.57%) becomes more effectual when an analogous acceptor is used as a fluorophore in a TAF-OLED (TPA-THQ (NIR fluorophore) + TPA-DCPP (sensitizer) λEL ∼ 780 nm, EQE = 3.3%). Solution processable OLED with simple structured emitter as dendron donor + quinone acceptor, MPPACz, also shows promising EQE of 0.25% at λEL = 728 nm through dipole induced ICT.101 The curcuminoid BF2 derivative, TPABF2 affords an impressive solution-processable NIR-OLED with an EQE of ∼10% and negligible efficiency roll-off at a high current density of 750 mA cm−2 with a record high radiance due to the quenching of STA and TTA.50
Although the past decade has witnessed a wide resurgence, there is a large scope for further development in the field of NIR-TADF-OLED. (1) Improving the color purity without the use of a NIR optical filter could be of more practical use.60 The inherent ICT induced broadening of FWHM of a typical NIR-TADF could be well-addressed with multi-resonance TADF emitters where a short-range reorganization of the electron density from S1 to S0 is observed in a fused polycyclic aromatic compound with a donor and acceptor (typically N and B atoms para to each other), maintaining a high degree of electron–hole overlap.108,109 (2) It has been observed that an increase in doping ratio often red-shifts the emission maxima albeit with a stark sacrifice in both the PLQY and EQE due to ACQ.101,102 The effect of aggregation induced emission enhancement (AIE) could be introduced with extended π-surface, e.g., conjugated thiadiazole moiety, to counter-balance the adverse effect of ACQ.110,111 (3) Typically a rational design of twisted D–A or D-spacer-A leads to effective FMO overlap. This results in a bright fluorescence with a fast RISC process and effective triplet harvesting while avoiding the TTA effect. In this respect, since the NIR luminescence of a TADF is typically associated with the 1CT transition, the detrimental 3LE state should be well separated from the 1CT state.112 (4) In some cases where the FMO integral is poor, through-space electronic interactions between adjacent TADF molecules could also serve as a fruitful pathway for effective lowering of ΔEST and thus faster RISC.58 (5) To better commercialize with lower fabrication cost, the NIR-TADF OLEDs should be comprised of minimal sandwiched layers preferably with finely tuned and rationally designed HOMO–LUMO barriers including small organic or dendrimeric organic emitting layers.26
