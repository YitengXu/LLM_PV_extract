    , Accepted 12th January 2018First published on 12th January 2018AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been deemed as promising alternatives to silicon solar cells for the conversion of clean sunlight energy into electricity. A major limitation to their conversion efficiency is their inability to utilize light in the infrared (IR) spectral range, which constitutes almost half the energy of the sun's radiation. This fact has elicited motivations and endeavors to extend the response wavelength of DSSCs to the IR range. Photon upconversion through rare-earth ions constitutes one of the most promising approaches toward the goal of converting near-IR (NIR) or IR light into visible or ultraviolet light, where DSSCs typically have high sensitivity. In the present review, we summarize recent progress based on the utilization of various upconversion materials and device structures to improve the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells.
1. Introduction
Sunlight is a free energy treasure that can be utilized by photovoltaic technologies to transform photon energy into electricity.1–3 In only one hour, the sun is able to provide more energy to the earth's surface than what is needed to fulfill the demands of humanity for one year.4 The increasing consumption of conventional energy resources and aggravating climate change have given the impetus to explore sunlight energy as a means to meet a large portion of future energy needs. However, despite the great developments in solar cell technology over the past decades, the high cost of material and fabrication coupled with limited power conversion efficiency have restricted the extensive use of solar cells.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), first fabricated by Grätzel and co-workers in 1991, constitute a photovoltaic technology that has been demonstrated to be a potentially low-cost alternative to classic, single-junction silicon solar cells.5 To date, the highest conversion efficiency reached is 14.5%, obtained in a liquid-based DSSC.6 The conversion efficiency of DSSCs is strongly dependent on the commonly used, light-harvesting ruthenium dyes with band-gaps of about 1.8 eV, which can only absorb sunlight in a relatively narrow spectral wavelength range between 300 and 800 nm.7,8 This absorption feature precludes DSSCs from utilizing the infrared (IR) photons that constitute almost half of the solar energy reaching the Earth's surface, thus resulting in the so-called transmission loss mechanism that primarily limits solar cell efficiency.9–12 To address this problem, extensive efforts have been focused on the development of near-IR (NIR)-responsive photosensitizers for panchromatic DSSCs;13–15 efforts that, however, have been hampered by poor electron injection efficiency and high charge recombination rates.
Photon upconversion (UC) technology provides an alternative approach to address transmission loss by converting unutilized sub-bandgap NIR photons into visible photons to which DSSCs usually have high responsivity.16–22 The operation mechanism of rare-earth UC technology for a typical DSSC structure is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. It has been predicted that for a solar cell of 1.7 eV bandgap, which is close to that of typically used DSSCs, the Shockley-Queisser efficiency limit (the upper theoretical efficiency limit) can be boosted from 28.2% to as high as 43.6% using upconverters with a narrow absorption bandwidth of ∼0.5 eV.23 Moreover, the other advantage of spectral upconverters is that they can be applied to existing solar cells, and the optimization of the solar cell and the spectral converter can be done separately. This scenario engages the use of various types of rare-earth-doped UC materials to improve the performance of DSSC devices. Through the real ladder-like energy level structure of rare-earth ions, two or more photons can be absorbed sequentially or step-wise via real long-lived intermediate energy levels to efficiently produce one shorter wavelength photon in the visible or ultraviolet range. The involvement of real intermediate energy levels enables light upconversion to be efficiently produced with an excitation power density as low as ∼0.1 W cm−2,24 which is close to the level of solar illumination. Alongside the role of NIR-to-visible spectral converters, the light scattering property of UC materials also plays a significant role in the light-harvesting capability of the photoelectrode by utilizing optical trapping enhancement effects.25 Submicrometer-scale particles have been used as light scatterers to improve the light-harvesting ability of DSSCs. These unique features result in the significant light-harvesting advantage of DSSCs.

Herein, we review recent studies on the development and use of tailored rare-earth-doped UC materials with varying host lattices (primarily fluorides, oxyfluorides, and oxides) for use as upconverters in DSSCs (Fig. 1b). Three main device structures are discussed: one with UC materials in the back of the device as a light converting layer (structure 1); another employing an upconverting counter electrode (structure 2); and finally, one incorporating UC materials in the titanium oxide (TiO2) layer (structure 3). We have first described the fundamental processes of rare-earth upconversion, followed by a discussion of their recent applications in DSSCs. Lastly, we have provided our perspectives on the development of more efficient NIR-harvesting DSSCs based on rare-earth upconversion.
2. Rare-earth upconversion materials
Rare-earth upconversion materials are dilute guest–host systems in which trivalent lanthanide ions are embedded in an appropriate host lattice. The lanthanide dopants act as optically active centers that convert near-infrared (NIR) light into visible or ultraviolet (UV) luminescence. The upconversion luminescence results from 4f–4f orbital transitions with the accompanying wave functions localized within a single lanthanide ion and where the 4f electrons are shielded by the outer 5s and 5p shells, resulting in very sharp emission that exhibits high resistance to photobleaching and photochemical degradation. These intra-4f electronic transitions are forbidden by quantum mechanical spin selection rules, which, however, can be relaxed by the local crystal field-induced intermixing of the f states with higher electronic configurations. The forbidden nature of the 4f–4f transitions yields energy levels of very long lifetimes (up to tens of a millisecond),26 thus favoring the occurrence of sequential excitations in the excited states of a single lanthanide ion as well as permitting favorable ion–ion interactions in the excited states to yield energy transfer between two or more lanthanide ions. These features of the lanthanide dopants determine the basic UC mechanisms.26 As shown in Fig. 2, the upconversion mechanisms can include various processes such as excited-state absorption (ESA), energy transfer upconversion (ETU), cooperative sensitization upconversion (CSU), and photon avalanche (PA).27,28
 Fig. 2  Principal upconversion processes: (a) excited-state absorption (ESA), (b) energy transfer upconversion (ETU), (c) cooperative sensitization upconversion (CSU), and (d) photon avalanche (PA). The red, violet, and green lines represent photon excitation, energy transfer, and emission processes, respectively. 
The excited-state absorption (ESA) process is the simplest upconversion process in which the ion absorbs a photon matching the excitation of a long-lived level (E1 in Fig. 2), and the ion is subsequently excited by another matching photon to the excited state E2. The ion then decays from the excited state E2 to the ground state, emitting upconverted light. Lanthanides with a ladder-like arrangement of energy levels, such as Er3+, Ho3+, Tm3+, and Nd3+, can often be employed to generate highly efficient ESA.18
Unlike ESA, which occurs in a single lanthanide ion, the energy transfer upconversion (ETU) process requires two neighboring ions. In this process, ion 1, known as the sensitizer, is first excited from the ground state to a long-lived excited level E1 by absorbing a pump photon. Then, the absorbed energy is transferred to ion 2, which is in the ground state and is known as the activator. The ion 2 is then excited to its intermediate excited state and further excited from the intermediate state to the excited state E2. Subsequently, ion 2 decays from E2 to the ground state, emitting upconverted light. The upconversion efficiency of an ETU process is highly dependent on the concentration of the dopants as it determines the distance between the sensitizers and the activators.
The cooperative sensitization upconversion (CSU) process involves three ions, of which ion 1 and ion 3 are typically of the same type. Here, ion 1 and ion 3 are first excited to level E1 followed by the subsequent and simultaneous transfer of all the contained energy to ion 2, which is thereby excited to a higher state. The excited ion 2 relaxes to the ground state, emitting upconverted light. The efficiency of CSU is generally orders of magnitude lower than that of the ESA or ETU processes as it involves quasi-virtual pair levels during transitions that have to be described quantum mechanically with a higher order of perturbation.
Photon avalanche (PA) is a process that produces UC above a certain threshold of excitation. Below the threshold, very little upconverted fluorescence is produced, while the PL intensity increases by orders of magnitude above the pump threshold. In fact, PA is a looping process that involves the ESA processes for light excitation and an efficient cross relaxation (CR) process that produces feedback. The E1 level of ion 2 is initially populated by weak, non-resonant, ground state absorption. The looping process starts with the ESA process, exciting ion 2 from E1 to the emitting level E2. Then, an efficient CR process occurs between ion 1 and ion 2 as follows: E2 (ion 2) + GS (ion 1) → E1 (ion 2) + E1 (ion 1). Last, ion 1 transfers its energy to ion 2 to populate its E1 level, forming a complete loop. The net effect of the looping process is a single ion 2 in the long-lived E1 state producing two ions. When the looping process continues, two ions in the E1 state will produce four, four will produce eight, and so on, evoking an avalanche effect for the populating ion 2 in its E1 state, and thus the PA UC occurs from the emitting level E2.
Typically, the efficiency of upconversion materials hinges on three important parameters: (i) the concentration of the rare-earth ions; (ii) the host lattice; and (iii) the surface-related quenching mechanisms. Based on the host lattice and the type of rare-earth ions, composition engineering can result in an efficient output of upconversion. It is known that high dopant concentrations can lead to deleterious cross relaxation processes between the rare-earth ions that are harmful for upconversion processes. To avoid this, the concentrations of the rare-earth ions should be optimized for each upconversion material, e.g., for Yb3+/Tm3+-, Yb3+/Er3+-, and Yb3+/Ho3+-doped fluoride or oxide materials, which have been identified to be the most efficient ion pairs for multicolor upconversion (through the ETU mechanism) when excited at ∼980 nm.29–33 For Yb3+ ions (the sensitizers), the optimum concentration is around 20–100% for fluoride materials—depending on the structure of the nanoparticles—and 10% for oxide host lattices, whereas for the emitting ions (the activators), the concentration is determined to be typically about 0.5–1% for Tm3+ ions and 2% for both Er3+ and Ho3+ ions.29 The optimized activator concentration also works for both fluoride and oxide host matrices.
The judicious selection of an appropriate host material is also of great importance for high UC efficiency, as it affects the UC processes through either the phonon dynamics or the local crystal field around the rare-earth ions. The phonon-induced nonradiative process constitutes the main loss mechanism for UC emission. As a result, the UC efficiency is quite sensitive to the distribution of phonon density of states of the host lattice. The nonradiative processes often involve multi-phonon-assisted relaxation, whereby the energy difference between the higher and lower energy levels is converted into many lattice phonons. In general, the lower the phonon energy cutoff, the lower the efficiency of the nonradiative process. Among commonly investigated host materials (oxides, fluorides, vanadates, oxysulfides and oxy-fluorides), fluoride materials have the lowest phonon energy cutoff (e.g., NaYF4 with a phonon energy cutoff ∼350 cm−1), thus generally exhibiting high UC efficiency.34
For UC materials of nanoscale size, the surface characteristics are of essential importance for the luminescence efficiency as numerous lanthanide dopants are directly exposed to surface deactivation (surface defects, lattice strains, ligands and solvents that possess high phonon energies), which is associated to the high surface-to-volume ratio at the nanometer scale. To address this issue, upconversion nanoparticles with a core–shell structure have been developed, whereby a shell layer of defined thickness is epitaxially grown onto the core nanoparticles.25 The spatial isolation of the core nanoparticles from the surrounding quenching sites may enable efficient upconversion.
Hitherto, fluoride-based upconversion materials of nanoscale or microscale size, with or without a shell layer, have been widely investigated to improve the performance of DSSCs. For example, nano-sized and micro-sized particles of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+, nanoparticles of LaF3:Yb3+/Er3+, and orthorhombic phase nanoparticles of YF3:Yb3+/Er3+ have been broadly explored, primarily due to the known high upconversion efficiency.25
3. Application of upconversion materials in DSSCs
UC materials enable the extension of the harvesting spectral range of DSSCs to the IR range due to their unique frequency conversion ability. Various integration modes between UC phosphors and DSSCs have been employed (Fig. 1), including placement as rear reflector layers,35 use as internal counter electrodes, or incorporating phosphors into the TiO2 photoanode to form an UC-TiO2 nanocomposite. Typical UC materials with different host matrices for DSSC applications are summarized in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 below.
3.1 UC phosphors as rear reflector layers
When UC materials without any modifications are directly doped into TiO2 photoanodes, they act as charge recombination centers, thus decreasing the efficiency of the DSSCs. To address this problem, many researchers have focused on the use of UC materials as external layers, without complicating the existing DSSC structure. In 2011, Liu et al. prepared Er3+ and Yb3+ co-doped Y3Al5O12 transparent ceramics by a solid state reaction and placed the UC phosphors on the rear side of the counter electrode,36 a feature that enabled both light reflection and NIR sunlight harvesting. An enhanced performance of the DSSCs was accordingly observed under the illumination of a 980 nm laser. In a later report, Demopoulos et al. designed and prepared β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ nanoplatelets (Fig. 3a).37 Owing to its big size of 0.8 μm × 0.2 μm, the UC phosphor showed favorable fluorescence and strong light scattering. When the UC phosphor was placed on the rear side of the counter electrode, the modified DSSC achieved an enhancement of approximately 10% under simulated solar irradiation. A comparison of the performance of DSSCs with that of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ hexagonal nanoplatelets and β-NaYF4 hexagonal nanoplatelets without upconversion, indicated that about 1% of the relative efficiency increase originated from the IR light-photon conversion, whereas the remaining 9% relative efficiency increase stemmed from the scattering-enhanced light trapping.37 Instead of fluoride-based upconversion materials, in 2013, Miao et al.38 utilized Yb2O3:Er3+ polycrystalline upconverters as an IR light-harvesting layer on the rear side of the TiO2 photoanode, which exhibited broader and stronger visible upconversion luminescence than the well-established, still efficient, β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ particles under high power excitation of 980 nm. Employing the same device structure as that presented in Fig. 3a, the Y2O3:Er3+/Yb3+-based DSSC showed higher NIR response than the one based on β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ particles. Interestingly, Kim et al. placed a layer of plasmonic metal nanoparticles behind the layer of UC material as rear reflector (Fig. 3b), exploring the effect of localized surface plasmonic resonances on the UC process. Specifically, in their study, Fe3+-doped NaGdF4:Er3+/Yb3+ nanoparticles were used, which generated 30 times stronger photoluminescence than NaGdF4:Er3+/Yb3+ upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). When Ag nanoparticles were deposited under the layer of UCNPs, strong plasmonic-enhanced upconversion luminescence (induced by NIR field enhancement) was observed from the DSSC under excitation at 980 nm. With an optimal Ag reflector layer thickness, an overall solar cell efficiency of 7.1% was obtained, which was about 21% higher than that of DSSCs without light reflector layers of either UCNPs or Ag.39 This result validates that the synergic effect of plasmons and upconversion processes can be exploited as an effective strategy to enhance the performance of DSSCs.

3.2 UC phosphors as internal counter electrodes
In 2014, an alternative strategy employing as-prepared SnO2:Yb3+/Er3+ as the counter electrode was investigated and reported. In this structure, SnO2:Yb3+/Er3+ not only acts as the conducting layer but also as a catalyst to accelerate the combination of the I− ions with the electrons coming from the external circuit. As shown in Fig. 4a, the modified DSSC fabricated with a SnO2:Yb3+/Er3+ counter electrode exhibited a strong response signal in the 750–1000 nm IR region compared with common DSSC with a Pt counter electrode. The two surface photovoltage peaks in the NIR region corresponded well to the absorption peaks of Er3+ (peak at 800 nm) and Yb3+ (peak at 980 nm), validating the important role of the doped rare-earth ions. As shown in Fig. 4b, the DSSC with UC material as the counter electrode achieved a photocurrent intensity of 18.44 mA cm−2, resulting in a 9.12% enhancement of the overall efficiency.40 This novel integration method improved the IR-harvesting performance of the DSSCs and also reduced fabrication cost by replacing expensive Pt with SnO2:Yb3+/Er3+ UCNPs.

3.3 UC phosphor incorporated into electrolyte
Besides employing appropriate UC materials as an external reflector layer or directly using them as counter electrode layers, UC materials, mainly at the nanoscale, can be added to a DSSC device as light-harvesting dyes, thereby exploiting the dual functions of photon upconversion to relay NIR light energy and light scattering to enhance the sunlight trapping inside the DSSC device. The corresponding DSSC device structure, embedding UCNPs with varying hosts (such as fluoride, oxide and oxyfluoride), is illustrated in Fig. 5.

3.3.1 UC fluoride hosts for DSSCs. 
Lanthanide-doped LaF3 UCNPs were first applied in DSSCs by Demopoulos and co-workers in 2010,41 who demonstrated the ability of UCNPs to induce NIR light harvesting and improve DSSC efficiency. Subsequently, an Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped β-NaYF4 UCNP was demonstrated to be the best upconverter for improving the infrared absorption of DSSCs. Along this line, rare-earth doped β-NaYF4 upconversion materials functionalized with various structures were extensively investigated with respect to their influence on the performance of DSSCs, as summarized in Table 1.

Colloidal β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ UC nanoparticles were successfully incorporated into the photoanode by Yuan et al. in the first application of colloidal UCNPs to DSSCs. In their study, sub-10 nm Yb3+/Er3+ UCNPs of extremely small size were utilized, which allowed for easy infiltration into a TiO2 mesoporous film and thus for sufficient contact with TiO2 particles, similar to light-harvesting dyes. An obvious enhancement of the photocurrent was observed under direct NIR laser irradiation with escalated power output. Moreover, an overall absolute efficiency increase of 0.1% was obtained under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation, along with an increase in the incident photon to current (IPCE) spectra over a broad range of 300–800 nm.42 This indicated that UCNPs can serve not only as energy relay materials to enable NIR light harvesting but also as scattering materials to increase the light absorption capability of the cells. However, this weak overall increase in efficiency may be attributed to the charge recombination arising from surface defects in the UCNPs, which can severely inhibit the upconverting function. To solve this issue, a core–shell structured β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+@SiO2 nanoparticle was subsequently used in DSSCs. The designed SiO2 shell can efficiently isolate the direct contact between the UCNPs and the TiO2 photoanode, resulting in the suppression of the charge recombination process. As shown in Fig. 6b, the colloidal β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+@SiO2 sample showed green emission, which is located in the response area of the DSSCs. Furthermore, the J–V measurement indicated an enhancement of 0.38% in the efficiency of the DSSC due to the suppression of the charge recombination process by the core–shell design (see Fig. 6d).43

The limited enhancement in efficiency may be attributed to the UCNPs or UCNPs@SiO2 particles occupying the TiO2 nanoparticle sites because of direct doping of the photoanode. This integration mode decreases the absorbing capacity of the N719 dye. As an alternative, the TiO2 shell layer was coated on the β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ nanoparticle.44,45 This new core–shell structure not only solved the lower dye-loading problem, but also triggered the transmission of the electrons in the photoanode. As is well known, although β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+@TiO2 possesses some positive properties, the UCNPs can act as charge recombination centers when they are in direct contact with the TiO2 shell. To minimize the recombination induced by the UCNPs, the double shell structure NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+@SiO2@TiO2 has been reported.46–48 Zhao et al. synthesized core/double-shell structure particles, including the core of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+, an inner SiO2 shell of thickness about 10 nm and an outermost layer of TiO2, as shown in Fig. 7a. The SiO2 layer prevented the photoelectrons from being trapped in UC recombination centers, and the core/double-shell structure with the outermost TiO2 shell was able to host the same number of dye particles compared with the pure TiO2 photoanode. As shown in Fig. 7b, despite the β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+@SiO2@TiO2 samples showing a weaker photoluminescence than the β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+ core, they generated an enhancement of 10.9% in the efficiency of the DSSC.46

Although UC materials show good potential for improving DSSC efficiency, the contribution of photon UC often accounts for only a small portion of the improvement, while the scattering effect plays a dominant role in the enhancement of DSSC efficiency. Therefore, to increase the contribution of photon UC, the authors of ref. 49 decorated a plasmonic noble metal on the surface of β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+@SiO2 nanoparticles, as shown in Fig. 8. In this composite structure, the SiO2 inner layer on NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ contributes to the Au attachment and acts as an isolating layer to block electron trapping and capture by the UC material (Fig. 8a and b). As one can see in Fig. 8c and d, the emission intensity of the UC could be greatly enhanced because the plasmonic resonance frequency of Au overlaps well with the green and red emission of NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ UCNPs. This result indicates that this design, combining improved UC emission, light scattering and plasmonic resonance in NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@SiO2@Au composite layers, can achieve an enhancement of 8.23% in the efficiency of DSSCs.49

In a study reported by Zhao et al.,50 β-NaYF4:Er3+/Yb3+@SiO2@Au particles coated with a TiO2 shell were applied in the DSSCs. This outermost TiO2 layer coating design endows the composites with two significant functions: retaining the dye-loading amount and reducing the resistance by inducing photoelectron transport in the photoanode film. To date, the UC contribution of all the mentioned UCNPs for the improvement of DSSC efficiency still remains limited, which is attributed to the single-band absorption of rare-earth ions (typically, Yb3+ in 980 nm and Er3+ in 1532 nm) only playing a subtle role in the IR light conversion. Therefore, to increase the IR absorption range, Nd3+ ions with a strong response to 785 nm IR light were introduced into the shell layer in β-NaYbF4:Er3+@ NaYF4:Nd3+ core–shell NPs by Yuan et al. It is notable that based on the respective response of the β-NaYbF4:Er3+ core and the NaYF4:Nd3+ shell to 785 and 980 nm irradiation, this NIR-insensitive DSSC coupled with β-NaYbF4:Er3+@ NaYF4:Nd3+ core–shell NPs can work under 785 nm and 980 nm illumination(see Fig. 9). Furthermore, the DSSC based on IR double-band responding UCNPs showed a great increase in photocurrent and overall efficiency, achieving a 15.6% efficiency enhancement under simulated solar irradiation.51 This result strongly verifies the importance of exploring IR multiband conversion for improving the performance of DSSCs.

The application of CeO2:Er3+/Yb3+, Y2O3:Er3+/Yb3+ and Gd2O3:Ho3+/Yb3+etc. in DSSCs show good IR light-harvesting ability and conversion into visible photons,52–55 confirming that lanthanide-doped inorganic oxides can also make a significant impact on the overall efficiency of the DSSCs under simulated sunlight irradiation. As is well known, hollow structures can be very beneficial to strengthen scattering effects. Liao and co-workers designed and synthesized NaxGdFyOz@TiO2 hollow spheres via a simple hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 10a). Both a prominent scattering effect and UC function could be obtained in such a core–shell composite. As shown in Fig. 10b, 8 wt% NaxGdFyOz@TiO2 hollow spheres, with a size of 430 nm possessing a superb light scattering property, were mixed into the TiO2 photoanode layer, achieving an efficiency enhancement of 11.3%.56 Most recently, in another report from Han's group, Er3+/Yb3+-co-doped CeO2 hollow spheres were prepared and incorporated into the photoanode, generating a 27% enhancement of the overall efficiency. This effect can mainly be attributed to the dual effect of light scattering and photon UC.57

As an alternative to oxide hosts for lanthanide ions, TiO2 can be utilized to improve the IR response of DSSCs after being doped with lanthanide ions. In 2013, Yang and co-workers doped Er3+ into TiO2 particles for auxiliary absorption of IR sunlight. As shown in Fig. 11a and b, the optimized TiO2:Er3+ photoanode could significantly increase the value of the open-circuit voltage and the response to sunlight; in fact, the modified DSSC displayed an increased photocurrent of 13.38 mA cm−2 and enhanced efficiency of 6.63%.58 The enhancement can be attributed to two factors. On one hand, the Er3+-doped TiO2 material absorbs NIR sunlight and emits green light that can be strongly absorbed by the dye molecules, thus generating more photoinduced electrons. On the other hand, the Er3+ ions doped in the TiO2 material occupy the Ti4+ sites, which benefits the generation of extra electron holes in the photoanode. This probably improves the energy levels of the TiO2 semiconductor, finally leading to an increase in the open-circuit voltage.

In another study in 2014 by Yang and coworkers, Ho3+, Yb3+ and F− ions were doped into TiO2, and the resulting compound could emit strong visible light under 980 nm excitation. Moreover, the flat-band potential and the Fermi level of the TiO2 photoanode were greatly improved by tri-doping Ho3+–Yb3+–F− ions into the TiO2 photoanode, leading to an enhanced separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The UC-based DSSC achieved a Voc of 0.77 ± 0.01 V, Jsc of 21.00 ± 0.69 mA cm−2, and η of 9.91 ± 0.30%, thus generating a 37% efficiency enhancement compared with that of the DSSC with a pure TiO2 photoanode (η of 7.19 ± 0.13%).59


3.3.3 UC oxyfluorides for DSSCs. 
Aside from fluorides and oxides, oxyfluoride materials can also be used as host materials for upconversion ions due to their low photon energy compared with fluorides and their optical and chemical stability. As a first example, in 2012, Lin and co-workers incorprated YOF:Er3+/Yb3+ nanoparticles into a TiO2 electrode and achieved a 1.23-fold enhancement in efficiency at 7 wt% doping level of YOF:Er3+/Yb3+ (Fig. 12b).60

Yang et al. subsequently fabricated a TiO2−xFx:Yb3+/Er3+ UC powder with excellent UC properties, improving the absorbed percentage of visible light by N719 dyes. This designed structure is beneficial to get a lower band gap energy, thereby leading to faster electron injection and reduction of the radiative recombination probability of the photo-generated electrons and holes in the photoanode. TiO2−xFx:Yb/Er was used as an NIR light converting and light scattering layer, exhibiting higher light harvesting and lower light loss and finally achieving an enhancement of the DSSC efficiency from 5.40% to 7.08%.61

4. Discussions and outlook
UC materials perform well in enhancing the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells irrespective of whether they are inserted into the photoanodes (structure 3), coated onto the fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO) (structure 2), or positioned outside as a reflector layer (structure 1). However, there is still a lot of room to improve the performance of DSSCs using UC technology via two main aspects: (1) structure optimization of the existing three main structures and (2) acquisition of efficient upconverting nanocrystals for improved performance of energy relay.
In structure 1, when the UC materials are positioned outside the cell, the upconverted light must pass through the FTO glass, making the intensity much weaker when it reaches the dye molecules. Thus, it would be appealing to utilize an FTO glass with smaller thickness and better transmissivity, while employing core–shell-structured UC materials with better upconversion efficiency. In structure 2, using the upconverting layer of the FTO glass as the counter electrode can have the advantage of guaranteeing the original intensity, while bearing with the potential problem that the catalytic property of UC ion-doped oxide does not match with that of Pt. As a result, it would be attractive to seek other low-cost counter electrode materials with excellent catalytic activity towards the iodine-based redox couple, while incorporating rare-earth ions for efficient upconversion. In structure 3, UC nanoparticles can be used favorably inside a solar cell, where they can serve as reflectors or charge recombination centers. Another possible route is to coat an insulating shell, such as SiO2, on the surface of the nanoparticles. As UC nanoparticles not only perform a UC function but also serve as scattering centers, their morphology becomes important; for example, a big size fluoride UC nanoparticle can be regarded as a micro-prism that enhances the scattering effect. Noble metals can be coated onto the surface of the nanoparticles to enhance the scattering as well as to strengthen the photoluminescence intensity through the plasmonic effect. Furthermore, hollow structures can enormously increase the scattering effect. To alleviate the reduction of the amount of dye-loading, the TiO2 shell is usually coated, and to further reduce the distance between the UC centers and the dye molecules, one can even directly dope the upconverting ions into the TiO2 material, which also has the advantage of increasing the open-circuit voltage because of the p-type doping. Due to their chemical resistance and stable optical properties, rare-earth ion-doped oxides also serve as favorable UC materials. However, for this structure, the extra shell, such as a TiO2 or SiO2 shell, can reduce the photoluminescence intensity of the UC material, which immensely limits the function of the material.
The major challenge of the mentioned three structures in increasing the efficiency of DSSCs refers to two limiting spectral aspects of UC materials: (i) the low upconversion efficiency and (ii) the low, narrow-band absorption of rare-earth ions due to the nature of f–f transitions. Until recently, the portion of efficiency increase contributed by the UC effect was less than 2.1% of the total relative efficiency increase of DSSCs.62 Strategies such as plasmonic enhancement, energy transfer engineering and suppression of surface-related deactivations are being exploited to achieve high efficiency in UC nanoparticles26 and are expected to result in higher efficiency improvements. To alleviate the problem of narrow-band absorption characteristics of UC materials, the strategy of using organic antennas consisting of infrared molecular dyes with strong absorption coefficients and broadband near-infrared absorption, in particular, can be mentioned. This direction has been shown to result in an overall upconversion enhancement of three orders of magnitude.63–65 By optimizing the spectral overlap between dye emission and rare-earth absorption, UC materials with high upconverting quantum yields (∼10%) and broadband IR absorption (over 200 nm) have been obtained.66–69 The application of organic dye (IR-783)-sensitized UC materials to DSSCs has enabled an increase in the contribution of the UC process from the previously reported highest value of ∼2.1% to 7.1%,62 resulting in an overall relative efficiency increase of 13.1%. It can also be envisioned that by selecting a range of suitable organic dyes to simultaneously sensitize UC nanomaterials, a significant portion of the IR spectrum can be harvested and converted into visible light, thus considerably increasing the overall efficiency of a DSSC. Moreover, by introducing a shell or double shell, such as a TiO2 or SiO2 shell, to the surface of the organic dye-sensitized UC nanocrystals, the drawback of UC materials acting as charge recombination centers can be avoided (in structure 3), thus enabling DSSCs to have better performance. Structural optimization and UC material optimization are two independent efficiency improvement strategies; the combination of both tactics is expected to have profounding effects on the performance of DSSCs.
5. Conclusions
Photon upconversion can potentially overcome transmission loss in dye-sensitized solar cells by converting unutilized, sub-bandgap NIR photons into visible photons, which is a fact that has inspired a new research field in solar cell technology. There are three typical device structures for rare-earth-doped UC materials (with varying host lattices) in DSSCs: placing the UC material at the back of the device as a light-converting layer (structure 1); employing an upconverting counter electrode (structure 2); incorporating UC compounds in the titanium oxide (TiO2) layer (structure 3). Optimizing these three structures using new, purposely-tailored UC nanostructures can further boost the DSSC efficiency. For example, structure 3 is the most often employed structure reported in literature, but it also produces charge recombination centers on the surface, which limits the overall performance of the DSSC. Introducing a SiO2 and/or a TiO2 shell on the UC nanomaterial surface can be an effective approach to avoid this drawback. Note that the UC efficiency, the scattering property, and the rare-earth absorption ability primarily determine the overall performance of UC materials in DSSCs. Surface plasmon resonance enhancement, composition engineering, and nanophotonic control of energy transfer will play significant roles in enhancing upconversion efficiency, while the scattering effect can be strengthened by the size and/or hollow structure design. The low and narrow band absorption from the f–f transitions of rare-earth ions poses a fundamental limit for the light-harvesting ability of the UC materials. A simultaneous use of multiple rare-earth ions in a defined nanostructure with suppressed cross relaxations can broaden the IR light harvesting for efficient upconversion. More importantly, it has been shown that organic dye-sensitized upconversion is a viable way to address the absorption challenge, with the advantages of having a dye absorption cross section being at least three orders of magnitude larger and an absorption band in the IR range70 about 10–20 times broader than that of a rare-earth ion. As a result, further exploration of dye-sensitized upconversion in DSSC devices will be very promising.70 The combination of UC material design and structure optimization might generate a combined effect on the improvement of DSSC performance. Overall, the field is wide open for further research, with potentially great impact on solar cell technology and exciting results for the energy sector and the public.
