    , Accepted 17th May 2021First published on 18th May 2021AbstractDue to the simple structure and excellent scalability, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has become much more popular as a low-cost donor polymer partner with the emerging nonfullerene acceptors in recent years. Presently, the application and the molar mass dependence of direct arylation polycondensation (DArP) prepared P3HT in fullerene-free organic solar cells have not been explored yet. In this work, five batches of P3HT with weight-average molar mass ranging from 8.9 kg mol−1 to 89.1 kg mol−1 were successfully prepared via DArP, with the aim to detail the interaction–performance relationships in the state-of-the-art P3HT:nonfullerene photovoltaic blend, namely P3HT:ZY-4Cl. Our thermodynamic analysis revealed that the amorphous–amorphous interaction parameters strongly depend on the P3HT molar mass and can be varied by a factor of 2.75. Owing to the best π–π stacking order deduced from grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and the smallest domain size, the blend based on the medium molar mass batch (25.5 kg mol−1) delivered the highest current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency up to ∼10% among the five systems. Our study confirmed that DArP is an effective protocol for the synthesis of P3HT for efficient non-fullerene polymer solar cells and the established relationships can be applied to screen the best batch for P3HT-based organic photovoltaics.
1. Introduction
Due to the advantages of high scalability and low cost, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been a benchmark material used in organic electronics such as transistors, thermoelectrics, and solar cells.1–3 Most notably, P3HT is the lowest cost photovoltaic polymer in the field of organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs)4–7 and has been the most commonly used donor polymer in fullerene-based organic solar cells during the last two decades. P3HT was considered as the fruit-fly in OPV research;8,9 however, slow progress in power conversion efficiency has been made since the achievement of 7.4%-efficiency devices by Li and collaborators1 in 2012. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of P3HT lags much behind those of non-P3HT donors such as low bandgap benzodithiophene-containing polymers10 and becomes much less competitive in the field of fullerene-based systems.
Since the innovation of a fused ring electron acceptor named ITIC11 in 2015, P3HT has received significant attention again along with the rapid development of nonfullerene small molecule acceptors.12 Particularly, multiple cases of nonfullerene acceptors (see examples in Fig. 1a) were designed with the aim to match with P3HT.13–17 For instance, Chen and co-workers reported a nonfullerene acceptor based on spirobifluorene and diketopyrrolopyrrole, which produced over 5% efficiency in fullerene-free OPV devices.18 McCulloch et al. developed a pair of indacenodithiophene-based acceptors named EH-IDTBR and O-IDTBR, which afforded over 6% efficiency and outperformed their fullerene counterparts under the same conditions.19 They also used various batches of P3HT in O-IDTBR based OPVs to explore the effect of molecular weight on photovoltaic performance.19,20 In 2019, Huang et al. reported a simultaneous enhancement of three photovoltaic parameters in P3HT-based OPVs by replacing alkyl chains with alkoxy chains in the π bridges of nonfullerene acceptors and reached a maximum PCE of 6.6%.21 By manipulating the drying kinetics with the introduction of a high boiling point co-solvent, Han et al.22 further promoted the efficiency of P3HT:O-IDTBR up to 7.18%. A new nonfullerene acceptor TrBTIC designed by Peng et al.23 further delivered a greater PCE of 8.25%. Most recently, the Hou group engineered the cyano-substituted end groups in BTP-4Cl and invented a novel nonfullerene acceptor ZY-4Cl24 (see Fig. 1a). This new acceptor achieved a record value that breaks 9% efficiency in P3HT-based OPVs, benefiting from the relatively lower P3HT:nonfullerene miscibility.

Despite the rapid progress in P3HT OPVs, all of the studies mentioned above were based on P3HT materials prepared by the traditional Grignard metathesis (GRIM) method.4 Generally, the GRIM method needs to go through more than 3 steps to obtain P3HT from 2-bromo-3-hexylthiophene (Fig. 1b), in which a Ni catalyst transfer mechanism is involved in polymerization. However, the preparation of organometallic reagents increases synthetic steps and produces additional waste, which does not meet the requirements of green chemistry. Instead, direct arylation polycondensation (DArP) represents a very promising method for the large-scale synthesis of P3HT. Direct arylation is proposed to proceed through a catalytic cycle similar to traditional cross-couplings, beginning with the oxidative addition of palladium(0) into an aryl halide substrate. Following this, the mechanism does not involve a transmetalation step but rather proceeds through a C–H activation step in which the palladium is inserted into the most active C(sp2)–H bond through concerted-metalation-deprotonation (CMD). Reductive elimination of the cross-coupled product regenerates palladium(0) and generate cross-coupling thiophenes. This method has the advantages of synthetic feasibility (via a single step)25,26 and high atom-economy (only breaks C–H/C–Br bonds). Moreover, the synthetic cost of P3HT via DArP is estimated to be less than 10 $ g−1, based on a recent report.27 It has been shown that the physical (optical, mechanical, and electrical) properties of P3HT are strongly affected by the molar mass.28–32 Although how the performance of P3HT:fullerene systems varies with the polymer molar mass has been extensively documented,33 less attention has been paid to elucidating the influence of molecular mass and the sensitivity of P3HT batches on the morphology and performance of P3HT:nonfullerene solar cells.19,20 In previous reports, it has been demonstrated that the molecular weight of the polymer donor (PTB7-Th, PM6, and so on) can have a vital influence on the charge carrier mobility, crystallization properties, film morphology, and bulk trap density of non-fullerene blend systems.34,35 However, the molar mass dependence of DArP prepared P3HT on fullerene-free OPV films has not been explored yet. As such, presently there is still no clear insight into the molar mass effect on the thermodynamic interaction, phase separation, and photovoltaic performance of nonfullerene blends based on DAP prepared P3HT. This knowledge gap severely precludes the advances of P3HT-based OPVs for industrial applications.
In this contribution, we set our goal to elucidate the polymer molecular mass–molecular interaction–photovoltaic performance relationships in the state-of-the-art P3HT solar cells. Five batches of P3HT with weight-average molar mass (Mw) ranging from 8.9 kg mol−1 to 89.1 kg mol−1, by a factor of 10, were synthesized by simply adjusting the polymerization time (see Fig. 1c). A recently reported A-DA’D-A nonfullerene acceptor ZY-4Cl24 was selected to pair with these P3HT batches. We systematically study the influence of P3HT molar mass on the miscibility, crystallinity, phase separation, and photovoltaic performance of their blends. Additionally, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis revealed that the Flory–Huggins interaction parameters (χaa) of these blends can be varied by a factor of 2.75. We found that simple tuning of Mw of P3HT results in a doubling of device PCE. Owing to the best π–π crystalline order and most favorable morphological features, the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend based on the medium molar mass batch (25.5 kg mol−1) produced a notable PCE of 9.6%, which is the highest value reported for P3HT-based OPVs. Our study thus revealed the fundamental relationships among molecular mass, molecular interactions, phase separation, and photovoltaic performances in P3HT-based fullerene-free solar cells. Most attractively, DArP is proved to be a very promising protocol for the synthesis of P3HT for efficient non-fullerene polymer solar cells.
2. Results & discussion
2.1 Properties of P3HT with different Mw synthesized by DArP
First, we prepared five batches of P3HT through tuning the reaction time of DArP (Scheme S1†). The regioregularity of all these different Mw polymers was about 90%, except for the lowest Mw batch. All of the DArP prepared P3HT batches are soluble in common processing solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). The solubilities of all P3HT batches are greater than 10 mg mL−1 in THF. A previous study24 by Hou et al. suggested that THF is the most appropriate solvent for processing P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend films. We thus concentrated on THF as the processing solvent. Absorption spectra in dilute THF solutions (Fig. S3†) clearly indicated that these polymers do not aggregate much in THF.
We used DSC to probe the crystalline nature of these polymer films (drop cast from THF). The DSC traces are displayed in Fig. 1d, and the melting points (Tm) and enthalpies (ΔHm) of the DArP prepared P3HT polymers are listed in Table S1.† As shown in Fig. 1e, we found that the Tm of P3HT increases monotonically with its Mw ranging from P-9K to P-26K. The Tm of P-9K is 168.6 °C, which is apparently lower than those of the other four Mw batches. The Tm of P-22K and P-26K is 190.5 °C and 200.9 °C respectively. However, from P-26K to P-89K, Tm seems to reach a plateau. A Tm of 201.6 °C and 203.1 °C was recorded for P-42K and P-89K. Nevertheless, ΔHm does not follow the same trend. It can be clearly seen that the highest ΔHm (16.4 J mol−1) is achieved for the medium molar mass batch (P-26K). This observation is quite similar to the results reported in prior work by Liu et al.33 on the Mw dependence of P3HT:PC61BM blend systems, which means that pure DArP P3HTs share analogous thermal properties to traditionally bought P3HT.
Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) was used to study the molecular packing and ordering of the neat films based on these five batches of P3HT. The in-plane and out-of-plane profiles are displayed in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The associated parameters are provided in Table S2.† The d-spacings of the (010) peaks of these polymers are approximately 3.80 Å except for P-89K (3.77 Å). The results of coherence lengths (Lc) determined by using the Scherrer equation show that the Lc of the (010) peak reaches the highest value (19.6 Å) for P-26K; from 25.5 kg mol−1 to 89.1 kg mol−1 (see Fig. 2c), Lc dropped to the lowest value of 13.3 Å at Mw = 41.9 kg mol−1 and 16.7 Å for P-89K. In addition, π–π peak intensity is used as a metric to compare the crystalline order of the samples. As shown in Fig. 2d, the diffractograms of these five batches of P3HT showed that the π–π intensity becomes higher as the Mw increases initially and decreases afterward; the peak intensity of P-26K was much higher than those of the other Mw batches. Combining the DSC and GIXRD results, we can conclude that P-26K possesses the highest crystalline order among the five batches of P3HT.

2.2 Molecular interactions of P3HT:ZY-4Cl blends
To understand the origin of the performance difference, we analyzed the donor:acceptor interactions37 by two different methods, namely DSC melting point depression and contact angle measurements. As ZY-4Cl does not exhibit any exothermic or endothermic transitions in our DSC scan (see Fig. S4†) and weak peaks in the 2D GIXRD pattern (see Fig. S5†), we consider P3HT as the main variable to explore the molecular interactions of these five systems. Thus, we need to consider the interactions between ZY-4Cl and two parts (i.e., crystalline portion and amorphous portion) of P3HT. These interactions can be captured by the theoretical treatment of crystalline–amorphous polymer blend systems by Kyu and colleagues.38,39 Specifically, the total free energy of mixing for a crystalline polymer and amorphous small molecule blend system can be described by the Kyu formula (eqn (1)): (1)where f(ψ) is the variation of free energy of crystallization, N is the degree of polymerization of the polymer, and χ is the effective combination of the crystalline–amorphous interaction parameter (χca) and the amorphous–amorphous parameter (χaa). The latter is broadly known as the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter representing the amorphous–amorphous interaction. χca is proportional to the enthalpy of crystallization or melting (ΔH), i.e., χca ∝ ΔH/RT.
We monitored the change of the melting points of these P3HT materials in the corresponding fullerene-free blends upon the addition of ZY-4Cl. The DSC traces of blend films with different blend ratios are provided in Fig. S6.† We first used the Nishi–Wang formula (eqn (2)) to estimate the χaa parameters of the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blends. (2)where Tm is the melting point of the crystalline polymer in a blend, T0m and ΔHf refer to the melting temperature and melting enthalpy of pure crystalline polymer-P3HT, vm is the monomer molar volume of the polymer and vs is the molar volume of the acceptor, ϕs represents the volume fraction of the acceptor, and R is the ideal gas constant. By fitting the DSC data to eqn (2), we extracted χaa parameters as listed in Table 1. χaa was found to increase drastically with higher molar mass. The χaa of the P-89K blend is nearly 2.75 times the value of the P-9K blend (Fig. 3). In addition, we compared the relative χaa of the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blends deduced from contact angle measurements (see Table S3†). It is noteworthy that the trend agrees with the data obtained from DSC.

(f) The plot of χaa of the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blends with the polymer Mw. The fitted lines are obtained according to eqn (2). 
Additionally, χca can be determined from the DSC melting point depression of P3HT using (3)where Tm0 is the melting point of neat P3HT. χca at melting points can be determined by using eqn (3) from the slope, S, of the (1 − Tm/Tm0) against (1 − ϕs) plots (see Fig. S7†). The values are listed in Table 1. Similar to χaa parameters, the χca parameters of the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blends follow a monotonic trend of increasing with the Mw of P3HT except for P-89K:ZY-4Cl. This is the first time that the χca parameters of the P3HT:acceptor blends are reported. As a consequence, the thermodynamic interaction parameters depend heavily on the Mw of P3HT. The rapid increase of χ (especially χaa) in such systems may strongly influence the morphology and PCE of the blend films.
2.3 Photovoltaic performance and loss mechanisms of P3HT:ZY-4Cl blends
In order to determine the effect of P3HT molar mass on the device performance of our model P3HT:nonfullerene system and establish correlations between interaction parameters and performance parameters, we fabricated OPVs with a conventional device architecture, as illustrated in Fig. 4a. Next, we characterized the device performance of the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blends with the photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 1. With Mw increasing, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the OPV device has dropped slightly; both the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF) show a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. As a consequence, the PCE also shows a similar change to Jsc and FF. Of these five batches, P-26K possesses the best PCE. This optimal P3HT:ZY-4Cl device afforded a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 16.5 mA cm−2, a FF of 65.4%, and a PCE of 9.60%, which is to our knowledge the highest value reported for P3HT-based organic solar cells.24 As a comparison, traditional P3HT purchased from Rieke Metals gave a slightly lower PCE of 9.1% in our lab (Fig. S8†). In order to test DArP P3HT reproducibility in our lab, two additional batches of P3HT were prepared under the same DArP conditions as P-26K, and over 9% PCE was obtained for these two batches of P3HT.

External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were acquired to understand the difference in photoresponse. The EQE values are generally below 60% for P-9K, P-22K, P-42K, and P-89K devices. In contrast, the P-26K device exhibited a much more efficient photon response with EQE approaching 70% in the range from 300 to 800 nm. Thus, the EQE curve of P-26K over the full wavelength range (300–800 nm) gave an integrated value of 15.7 mA cm−2, which supports the reliability of J–V measurements. Detailed data from EQE are shown in Table 1 and we found that all Jsc values are consistent with the results from J–V measurements. The performance difference of these P3HT:ZY-4Cl devices can be further understood by in-depth analysis of the morphological features.
Hole-only and electron-only devices were designed as ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MnO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDIN/Al to investigate charge mobility in active layers, respectively. The space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method was used to measure hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) in the active layers. The J–V characteristics of hole-only devices and electron-only devices based on the five batches of P3HT:ZY-4Cl are displayed in Fig. S10.† The μh and μe values are calculated and summarized in Table S5.† The μh and μe of the P-26K:ZY-4Cl blend films are 5.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. According to the μh/μe value (1.31), the P-26K:ZY-4Cl system reaches a charge transport balance. It also means that appropriate percolation of the acceptor is necessary for achieving high performance in P3HT-based blends. To further investigate the Mw effect of P3HT on the charge transport and recombination in active layers, J–V curves of typical OPVs were recorded under illumination with different light intensities, as exhibited in Fig. 5 and S11.† Based on the corresponding J–V curves, the JSC ∝ Plightα and VOC ∝ β(kT/q)ln(Plight) relationships of the OPVs are described in Fig. 5a–e. Here, k is the Boltzmann constant, q is the elementary charge, and T is the absolute temperature. The bimolecular recombination can be evaluated from the parameter α, if α approaches 1, suggesting that bimolecular recombination could be negligible. The fitted α values are 0.890, 0.891, 0.896, 0.891 and 0.888, respectively for the five batches of OPVs, which are very similar in these devices. The α value of 0.896 is closer to 1 in the five P3HT:ZY-4Cl devices, indicating weakened bimolecular recombination in the P-26K:ZY-4Cl system. If the β value is close to 1, indicating negligible trap-assisted recombination in the active layers, the β of 1.40 for the optimal P-26K device is closer to 1, compared with that of 1.76, 1.60, 1.52, and 1.69 for P-9K:ZY-4Cl, P-22K:ZY-4Cl, P-42K:ZY-4Cl, and P-89K:ZY-4Cl, suggesting that trap-assisted recombination can be efficiently restrained in the P3HT:ZY-4Cl OPVs. Both the α and β values of the P-26K are closer to 1, suggesting that the loss of photogenerated carriers can be efficiently decreased through regulating the Mw of P3HT. This phenomenon is consistent with the change of photovoltaic performance. The important thing is that we found that the system has not yet reached an α/β value of unity, which means that the system still has room for optimization. We note that α deviating from unity is not only caused by bimolecular recombination, which is often mentioned in the literature,30 but a deviation from unity can also be caused by imbalanced hole and electron mobility. Finally, the ideality factors of the five batches of P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend films were obtained by dark J–V measurements. As shown in Fig. S11,† the ideality factors are 1.38, 1.77, 1.33, 1.62, and 1.89 from P-9K:ZY-4Cl to P-89K:ZY-4Cl. The relatively small value of P-26K:ZY-4Cl explains why the device performs better. Subsequently, we obtained Fig. S11c† according to previous studies.40–42 Our calculations suggested that the shunt resistances of the five blend systems are 7.6, 30.4, 35.8, 23.8, and 3.4 kΩ, respectively. The higher shunt resistance may be related to the increase in the fill factor, which has been demonstrated in previous reports.

2.4 Microstructures of P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend films
To gain insights into the bulk morphology of the blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were acquired to compare their surface roughness and phase separation. As can be seen from the height images (Fig. 6a), the root–mean–square roughness (Rq) of P-9K is as high as 12.60 nm. As the Mw of P3HT increases, Rq first decreases to 4.85 nm and then increases to 10.35 nm. The rough films with Rq up to 10 nm are not suitable to achieve high photovoltaic performance. The lowest Rq of 4.85 nm was observed for the P-26K blend. The much smoother film is often beneficial to the interfacial contact between the active layer and metal electrodes, which might facilitate the charge collection in the OPV devices. The phase images depicted in Fig. 6b shows that the size of phase separation shows a similar trend: the domain size becomes large first and then decreases. The smallest domains were formed in the blend films based on P-26K.
 Fig. 6  AFM height images (a) and phase images (b), and TEM images (c) of the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend films. 
Fast Fourier transform analysis43 of AFM phase images was further applied to quantitatively estimate the size scale of phase separation. Power spectral density (PSD) plots shown in Fig. S9† indicated that the characteristic domain spacing of P3HT:ZY-4Cl blends is 141 nm, 104 nm, 86 nm, 142 nm, and 200 nm, respectively. Except for P-26K:ZY-4Cl, all blend films exhibited characteristic length scales of over 100 nm, which are much larger than the typical exciton diffusion length.44 Among the five blend films, the P-26K based film exhibits the lowest domain spacing, which is more desirable for efficient charge dissociation and transport. The bulk morphology was also investigated via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As depicted in Fig. 3c, the structural features of the blend films are rather different. Large domains on a length scale of 100–200 nm can be seen in the blend films of P-9K and P-89K. In particular, dark dots with a typical diameter of several tens of nanometers appeared in the two highest Mw batches (P-42K and P-89K). The dots are likely aggregates of ZY-4Cl. As evidenced from the AFM and TEM images, the smoothest film and smallest domain spacing formed in the P-26K:ZY-4Cl blend film. Taken together, the optimized morphological features of the P-26K:ZY-4Cl blend film as seen in the microscopic data correlate well with its highest Jsc and FF, as depicted in Fig. 4d.
GIXRD was further employed to probe the molecular packing and crystallinity of the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend films. The detailed data are summarized in Table S4.† Through detailed peak-fitting of the out-of-plane profiles in Fig. 7a, we analyzed the scattering intensity of (010) peaks for both P3HT and ZY-4Cl in the blend films, as plotted in Fig. 7b and c and Table S4,† respectively. The comparison between the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend films indicates that ZY-4Cl possesses a more ordered packing especially in the P-26K blend, evidenced from the highest intensity for the ZY-4Cl peak. In the meantime, P-26K exhibited the highest (010) peak intensity, which reflects the degree of crystallinity for P3HT. Summing up, a medium Mw batch P-26K enables the highest P3HT crystallinity, most ordered ZY-4Cl packing, and most appropriate interpenetrating network in the blend films.

Here ϕi is the volume fraction of ZY-4Cl in the blend with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1. The grey band is the measured percolation threshold for electron transport (see Fig. S10†). The binodal curves are simulated by inputting the actual Mw of the P3HT materials and the mass densities of P3HT and the acceptor. 
2.5 Microstructure–property relationships
After characterizing the morphology, molecular interactions, and photovoltaic performance of the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blends, we now focus on establishing microstructure–property relationships. The morphological and photovoltaic data firmly showed that neither the lowest Mw batch nor the highest Mw batch can produce the desirable film morphology and solar cell performance. We find that P-26K has the highest crystallinity among the five Mw batches of P3HT in both pristine polymer films and blend films (mixed with ZY-4Cl). Furthermore, the medium Mw batch P-26K shows the smallest domain in its blend films based on AFM and TEM images. As the PCE of P-26K is also the highest, these favorable morphological features exhibited good agreement with the best device performance. Thus, a relatively strong crystallinity of P3HT and a small length scale of phase separation are needed in such a system.
From the viewpoint of mixing thermodynamics, a schematic χ–ϕ phase diagram as seen in Fig. 7d may give some hints about the performance difference. According to our DSC and contact angle estimates, the highest Mw batches P-42K and P-89K are hypo-miscible systems. To achieve optimal performance, this blend film has to be quenched to a non-equilibrium state with the composition approaching percolation, as demonstrated by our recent miscibility-performance model.37,45–47 In contrast, P-9K and P-22K are hyper-miscible systems and thus their performances are less efficient. The initial position of the medium Mw batch (P-26K) is most likely located within the two-phase regions. This can be inferred from the (thermal or solvent) annealing sequence experiments of the five blends, i.e., monitoring the device metrics as a function of thermal annealing time.
We noted that our observation of the Mw-performance in P3HT:ZY-4Cl is somehow different from the results presented by the McCulloch group for P3HT:EH-IDTBR and P3HT:O-IDTBR systems with varied Mw.19 In McCulloch's study, the P3HT was synthesized by the traditional method and P3HT:EH-IDTBR was found to be less sensitive to the Mw of P3HT. Meanwhile in our case, the medium Mw batch shows the smallest domain, the highest crystallinity, and the best device efficiency for its blend films. These different Mw dependencies across material systems possibly originate from the crystallinity difference of the nonfullerene small molecule acceptors. For instance, EH-IDTBR possesses multiple exothermic and endothermic DSC traces as well as some sharp diffraction peaks in GIXRD patterns.36 Nevertheless, ZY-4Cl is nearly feature-less in as-cast film (as noted above), which needs a good amount of P3HT crystallites to maintain charge transport channels.
In addition, in order to fully understand the Mw effect of DArP P3HT on other P3HT:NFA systems, we choose P3HT:Y6 as another example. The same five batches of P3HT and Y6 were blended and the processing conditions of the devices used were the same as those of ZY-4Cl. Because the LUMO level of Y6 is too low, the performance of the blend system is poor. Nevertheless, there is still such a clear trend in the P3HT:Y6 system: as the molecular weight of P3HT increases, the device PCE first increases and then decreases (0.96%, 1.50%, 2.14%, 2.04%, and 1.76% for P-9K, P-22K, P-26K, P-42K and P-89K blends respectively). The performance of the P3HT-Y6 blend also reached the peak value when P-26K was used (Fig. S12†). Taken together, the best P3HT batch for a given nonfullerene small molecule acceptor should provide high crystallinity and form relatively small domains with the acceptor.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we have elucidated the profound influence of P3HT molar mass on the crystallinity, miscibility, and phase separation of the present record-efficiency P3HT:nonfullerene blend, namely P3HT:ZY-4Cl, where P3HT is readily prepared via DArP. The investigations of five Mw batches of DArP prepared P3HT allow us to deduce a number of new observations: (1) simple tuning of the Mw of P3HT from 8.9 or 89.1 kg mol−1 to 25.5 kg mol−1 appears to result in a doubling of solar cell efficiency; (2) high Mw is not necessarily good for constructing high-performance P3HT based fullerene-free OPVs; (3) Flory–Huggins interaction parameter of the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend can be dramatically promoted by increasing the Mw of P3HT; (4) the best-performance P3HT batch needs to deliver the highest out-of-plane π–π stacking order and smallest domains. Clearly, our results of P3HT:ZY-4Cl blends with different Mw exemplarily show the crucial roles of phase demixing and crystallization in determining photovoltaic device performance, which represent new insights into optimizing P3HT-based OPVs. With the guidance of these relationships, researchers will be able to screen the best Mw batch for P3HT-based organic photovoltaics employing various nonfullerene acceptors.
Notably, by blending ZY-4Cl with P3HT with a medium molecular weight (25.5 kg mol−1), we achieved a PCE of 9.6%, which is the highest efficiency to date for P3HT-based solar cells. The performance comparison between GRIM and DArP methods demonstrated that the best-performance P3HT prepared in the present work outperforms traditional P3HT via GRIM, indicating the capability of direct arylation polycondensation to high-quality P3HT for nonfullerene OPVs. This is also the first report that demonstrates great potential to prepare well-matched P3HT for nonfullerene acceptors by an eco-compatible polymerization method with a very low synthetic cost. DArP is thus proved to be a much more desired protocol for the synthesis of P3HT for efficient non-fullerene polymer solar cells. We noted that the domain spacing of the best-performance P-26K:ZY-4Cl system is still much larger than the exciton diffusion length (∼20 nm). Thus, significantly reducing the domain spacing will be very beneficial for optimizing this class of OPV devices. Additionally, further efficiency improvements are possible by either finely tuning the regioregularity of P3HT or chemically engineering ZY-4Cl.
4. Experimental
4.1 Materials preparation and characterization
In order to obtain P3HT with different Mw, the reaction concentration and time were tuned in comparison with a literature report,48 as provided in the ESI.† The monomer 2-bromo-3-hexylthiophene was purchased from Innochem, and tetrahydrofuran (THF) was purchased from Energy Chemical. All other reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich or Heowns and used as received. All reactions were carried out using conventional Schlenk techniques in an inert argon atmosphere. ZY-4Cl was synthesized according to previously reported procedures.24 The regioregularities of these P3HT materials are quite comparable.
GPC in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at room temperature was used to estimate the polymer molecular weights and the GPC traces are given in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of solutions (10−5 mol L−1 in THF) and thin films (prepared by spin-coating 5.0 mg mL−1 THF solutions on quartz substrates) of compounds were recorded on a Shimadzu UV3600-plus spectrometer.
The thermal properties of P3HT polymers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The samples were prepared by drop-casting on glass slides and dried in a vacuum overnight. The DSC data were acquired on a Q25 TA differential scanning calorimeter (TA instruments) under a nitrogen atmosphere. For each sample, the temperature was increased from −50 °C to 250 °C with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 and then cooled to −50 °C at the same rate. The heating–cooling procedure was repeated twice and the second heating was used. The contact angle of polymer films was measured by using a JC2000D contact angle meter (Shanghai Zhongchen Equipment Co., Ltd) with 3 μL water or glycerol droplets.
GIXRD experiments of P3HT and the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blends were conducted on a Rigaku Smart Lab with a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.54 Å). The nanometer-scale surface topography of the samples was captured by using a Multimode 8 atomic force microscope (AFM) from Bruker in tapping mode. Both height and phase images with an identical area of 2 μm × 2 μm were recorded simultaneously with a silicon cantilever (T: 3.4 μm, length: 125 μm, width: 40 μm, f0: 300 kHz, and k: 40 N m−1), and the scan rate is 1.0 Hz. TEM images were acquired on a JEM-2100PLUS electron microscope (JEOL) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
2D GIXRD experiments were performed at beamline 1W1A, Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). An incidence angle of ∼0.16° was chosen to allow for complete penetration of X rays into the films. The beam center and sample-to-detector distance were calibrated with LaB6. The X-ray wavelength was 0.154 nm.
4.2 Solar cell fabrication and characterization
P3HT with varied Mw and ZY-4Cl was blended to construct nonfullerene solar cells. All of the fabricated OPVs were based on a regular device architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:ZY-4Cl/PDINO/Al. Each P3HT:ZY-4Cl (1:1 by weight) in a 14 mg mL−1 THF solution was stirred overnight at 40 °C to dissolve all materials. First, the PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated on top of a pre-cleaned ITO substrate, and then annealed at 140 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, P3HT:ZY-4Cl solution was spin-coated at 1500–2000 rpm for 40 s to obtain a film thickness of ∼110 nm, as determined by using a thin-film profilometer (Dektak XT, Bruker). To optimize the morphology of the blend film, the active layers were thermally annealed at 130 °C for 10 minutes. Finally, the device fabrication was completed by spin-coating PDINO and thermally evaporating 100 nm thick aluminum under vacuum (∼1.5 × 10−4 Pa). The effective area of each OPV device is 4 mm2, defined by metal masks. The J–V characteristics of the OPV devices were recorded under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 using a Class AAA solar simulator (Enli Tech, Taiwan). The intensity is calibrated with a standard silicon cell, which is purchased from Enli Tech (Taiwan). The external quantum efficiency data were obtained using a commercially available solar cell spectral response measurement system QE-R from Enli Tech.

Here ϕi is the volume fraction of ZY-4Cl in the blend with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1. The grey band is the measured percolation threshold for electron transport (see Fig. S10†). The binodal curves are simulated by inputting the actual Mw of the P3HT materials and the mass densities of P3HT and the acceptor.
