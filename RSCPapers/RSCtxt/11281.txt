    , Accepted 4th November 2017First published on 6th November 2017AbstractComprehensive investigations of near infrared (NIR) downshift and visible upconversion luminescence (UCL) mechanisms were carried out for Yb3+ single-doped and Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals under excitation at 256, 378, 520 and 980 nm. NIR emission at 976 nm from the Yb3+–O2− charge transfer state and UCL emission at 500 nm due to the cooperative emission of two Yb3+ ions were observed in SiO2:Yb3+ inverse opal upon excitation at 256 and 980 nm, respectively. The cooperative UCL of two Yb3+ ions was suppressed due to the photon trap created by the photonic band gap. For the SiO2:Er3+,Yb3+ inverse opals, NIR emission of Yb3+ at 976 nm and of Er3+ at 1534 nm were observed upon excitation at 256, 378 and 520 nm, respectively. Upon excitation at 378 and 520 nm, the 976 nm NIR emission of Yb3+ does not arise from (2H11/2/4S3/2) + 2Yb3+(2F7/2) → Er3+(4I15/2) + 2Yb3+(2F5/2) traditional quantum cutting. The NIR emission of Yb3+ at 976 nm may be due to the Er3+(2H11/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4I11/2) cross-relaxation energy transfer process upon excitation at 520 nm. The NIR emission of Yb3+ at 976 nm may arise from the cross-relaxation energy transfer of Er3+(4G11/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4F9/2) and Er3+(4F9/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4I13/2) upon excitation at 378 nm.
1. Introduction
Solar cells can convert solar energy into electrical energy by solar spectral conversion; these cells have recently attracted much attention due to the continuous depletion of fossil fuels.1 Silicon solar cells, with a 1.12 eV band gap, can easily absorb near infrared photons of the solar spectrum at about 1000 nm; however, the main energy of the solar light spectrum is in the ultraviolet and visible regions, which are not utilized by silicon solar cells.1,2 Thus, the highest conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells is about 30% due to mismatch losses of the solar spectrum.3 An efficient approach to improve the conversion efficiency of silicon solar cells is to make full use of solar energy in the ultraviolet and visible regions by spectral conversion using rare earth ions, including downshift (DS) and quantum cutting (QC) luminescence.4,5 Many DS and QC luminescence systems have been reported, such as Ce3+–Tb3+–Eu3+ and the ion pairs of Ce3+–Pr3+, Tb3+–Yb3+, Pr3+–Yb3+, Tm3+–Yb3+ and Er3+–Yb3+.4,6–11 In contrast to other rare earth ions, the trivalent ytterbium ion (Yb3+) with near infrared (NIR) emission located at around 1000 nm is a highly efficient ion to improve the efficiency of silicon solar cells. However, Yb3+ with a single excited 2F5/2 state has no direct absorptions in the ultraviolet and visible ranges. Consequently, NIR emission of Yb3+ is only obtained in luminescence systems co-doped with the rare earth ion pairs of Tb3+–Yb3+, Pr3+–Yb3+, Tm3+–Yb3+ and Er3+–Yb3+; its NIR emission mechanism from the QC process is well established. For example, for the Er3+–Yb3+ ion pair, the Er3+ ion transfers its energy to two Yb3+ ions through the path of Er3+(2H11/2/4S3/2) + 2Yb3+(2F7/2) → Er3+(4I15/2) + 2Yb3+(2F5/2); QC NIR emission is then obtained by the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of the Yb3+ ions.11 In addition to the QC mechanism, 1000 nm NIR DS emission of Yb3+ ions can be emitted by the Yb3+–O2− charge transfer state (CTS) upon ultraviolet excitation; thus, solar energy can be utilized in the ultraviolet region.12–14 However, to our knowledge, there are few reports of NIR DS emission of Yb3+ from mechanisms other than QC and the O2–Yb3+ charge transfer state. Therefore, investigation of the NIR DS emission of Yb3+ ions from other emission mechanisms has scientific and technological importance for solar cell applications.
Upconversion luminescence (UCL) can convert two or more low energy photons into one higher energy photon, which may be useful for infrared light applications. Thus, the conversion efficiencies of solar cells with lower band gaps can be improved by UCL.15–17 For example, rare earth ion-doped NaYF4 UCL nanoparticles were combined with titanium dioxide and silicon solar cells in order to enhance their conversion efficiency.18 Er3+ is an ideal luminescent center for UCL because it can be conveniently excited by an inexpensive commercial 980 nm laser. However, the UCL remains weak for materials that are single-doped with Er3+ due to its small absorption cross-section. Thus, Yb3+ ion, which has a wider absorption cross-section, is usually used as a sensitizer to increase the absorption cross-section of Er3+; high efficiency UCL of Er3+ can be obtained in Er3+–Yb3+ co-doped materials. At present, many investigations have been carried out on the NIR emission and UCL properties of Yb3+ single-doped and Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped powders and glass samples.19–21 However, there are few reports of UCL for Yb3+ single-doped powder and glass samples. In contrast with powders and glasses, inverse opal photonic crystal has a periodical ordered dielectric structure; thus, it has photonic band gap properties.22 Rare earth ion-doped inverse opals demonstrate modified photoluminescence due to the photonic band gap effect.23–26 Therefore, inverse opals co-doped with rare earth ions have scientific and technological importance for solar cell applications.27 In this work, Yb3+ single-doped and Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals were synthetized by a template-assisted method. The NIR downshift and UCL properties of Yb3+ single-doped and Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals were investigated. Downshifted NIR emissions at 976 nm attributed to the Yb3+–O2− charge transfer state were observed in the Yb3+ single-doped SiO2 inverse opals under excitation at 256 nm. Upon excitation at 980 nm, UCL at 500 nm was observed due to the cooperative emission of two Yb3+ ions in the SiO2:Yb3+ inverse opals. For the Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals, near infrared emissions of Yb3+ at 976 nm were observed upon excitation at 378 or 520 nm. These results demonstrate that the near infrared emissions of Yb3+ at 976 nm cannot be attributed to the traditional QC process caused by the Er3+(2H11/2/4S3/2) + 2Yb3+(2F7/2) → Er3+(4I15/2) + 2Yb3+(2F5/2) energy transfer process from Er3+ to Yb3+. A novel mechanism was proposed for the near infrared luminescence in Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opal.
2. Experimental
Polystyrene (PS) microspheres with a diameter of 490 nm were used to prepare the opals by a self-assembly method.28 The SiO2:9 mol% Yb3+,x mol% Er3+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2), SiO2:1 mol% Er3+,y mol% Yb3+ (y = 0, 1, 5, 9, 14) and SiO2:z mol% Yb3+ (z = 1, 5, 9, 14) sols were prepared using Er2O3, Si(CH3CH2O)4 and Yb2O3 as raw materials. Er(NO3)3 and Yb(NO3)3 were prepared by dissolving Er2O3 and Yb2O3 in hot HNO3. Stoichiometric amounts of Er(NO3)3, Si(CH3CH2O)4 and Yb(NO3)3 were dissolved in ethanol solution, respectively. After mixing the Er(NO3)3, Si(CH3CH2O)4 and Yb(NO3)3 ethanol solutions, a transparent SiO2:Yb3+,Er3+ solution was obtained. The ordered opals were infiltrated with the SiO2:Yb3+,Er3+ solution. The opals infiltrated with the SiO2:Yb3+,Er3+ solution were sintered at 900 °C in an air furnace. After cooling to room temperature, the SiO2:Yb3+,Er3+ inverse opals were obtained. The SiO2:Yb3+ inverse opals were prepared by the same approach except that the Er2O3 raw material was not used.
The microstructures of the opal template and the SiO2:Yb3+ inverse opals were characterized using a QUANTA200 scanning electron microscope. The lifetime decay curves and NIR emission spectra of the SiO2:Yb3+,Er3+ inverse opals were measured on an FLSP-980 spectrophotometer (Edinburgh, UK). The visible emission and UCL spectra of the SiO2:Yb3+ and SiO2:Yb3+,Er3+ inverse opals were measured on a HITACHI F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Absorption spectral measurements of the SiO2 inverse opals were carried out on a HITACHI U-4100 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan). The X-ray diffraction pattern of the SiO2: 5 mol% Yb3+ inverse opal was examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) performed on a D/max-2200 diffractometer.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Near infrared downshift photoluminescence of Yb3+ single-doped and Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals
The micro-structures of the opal template and the SiO2 inverse opals single-doped with 5 mol% Yb3+ were observed by SEM, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). An ordered hexagonal periodic structure was observed, and the typical opal and inverse opal structures were obtained. The microstructures of SiO2 inverse opal single-doped with various Yb3+ concentrations exhibited a similar ordered arrangement to that of SiO2 inverse opal single-doped with 5 mol% Yb3+. The absorption spectra of the Yb3+ single-doped SiO2 inverse opals were measured, as exhibited in Fig. 1(c). An absorption peak located at 675 nm attributed to the Bragg diffraction of the ordered periodic structure was observed, further demonstrating the ordered structure of Yb3+ single-doped SiO2 inverse opal. Fig. 1(d) shows the XRD pattern of SiO2 inverse opal single-doped with 5 mol% Yb3+. Only one broad XRD diffraction peak located at 22° was obtained in the SiO2 inverse opal single-doped with 5 mol% Yb3+, which indicated that the SiO2 inverse opal is in the amorphous phase.

The excitation spectrum monitored at the 976 nm NIR emission of the SiO2:9 mol% Yb3+ inverse opal is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a). An excitation band located at about 256 nm was observed when the emission was monitored at 976 nm in the SiO2 inverse opals single-doped with Yb3+. The 256 nm excitation band in the SiO2:Yb3+ inverse opals is attributed to the Yb3+–O2− charge transfer state (CTS).29,30 The CTS of Yb3+–O2− has been observed in Yb3+-doped YPO4 and lithium borate glass, located at 204 and 266 nm, respectively.29,31 The Yb3+–O2− CTS can result in NIR emission of Yb3+.32 The NIR emission spectra of the SiO2 inverse opals single-doped with various Yb3+ concentrations were measured under excitation at 256 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(a). All the samples exhibited a sharp peak located at 976 nm and a broad near infrared luminescence band at 1020 nm, which is attributed to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ ion. It was observed that the luminescence intensity of the Yb3+ ions increased initially and then decreased with increasing Yb3+ ion concentration, which is attributed to concentration quenching. The NIR emission in the SiO2 inverse opals single-doped with Yb3+ ions is related to the Yb3+–O2− CTS. A configurational coordinate diagram can be used to understand the mechanism of NIR emission from Yb3+ ions, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Upon excitation at 256 nm, the Yb3+ ion is excited to its CTS. The energy of the Yb3+–O2− CTS overlaps with that of the 2F5/2 state of Yb3+ ions. The non-radiative energy relaxation from the Yb3+–O2− CTS to the 2F5/2 state of Yb3+ ions populates the 2F5/2 excited state of Yb3+, and the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ ions results in the NIR emission at 976 nm. Previous investigations have demonstrated that NIR emission of Yb3+ at 976 nm can be observed in Yb3+ single-doped glasses upon excitation of the Yb3+–O2− CTS, which is similar to the present work.29

Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals were prepared using an ordered template of 490 nm PS microspheres, and their NIR emission downshifts and visible UCL properties were investigated. Fig. 3(a) and (b) exhibit the NIR emission spectra of SiO2:9 mol% Yb3+,x mol% Er3+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2) and SiO2:y mol% Yb3+,1 mol% Er3+ (y = 0, 1, 5, 9, 14) under excitation at 256 nm, respectively. It should be noted that the NIR emission at 1534 nm was not observed in the Yb3+ single-doped SiO2 inverse opals, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The Er3+ single-doped SiO2 inverse opal exhibits the 1534 nm NIR emission and does not exhibit the 976 nm NIR emission, as shown in Fig. 3(b). When Er3+ and Yb3+ ions were co-doped into SiO2 inverse opal, the 1534 and 976 nm NIR emissions were observed in the Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals. The 1534 and 976 nm NIR emissions are attributed to the 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ion and the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ ion, respectively. It can be observed from Fig. 3(a) that the intensity of the 976 nm NIR emission from the Yb3+ ions decreased with increasing Er3+ concentration for the SiO2:9 mol% Yb3+,x mol% Er3+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2) inverse opals. The intensity of the 1534 nm NIR emission from the Er3+ ions increases with increasing Er3+ concentration up to 1 mol% and then decreases when the Er3+ concentration further increases to 2 mol%. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3(b), the intensity of the 1534 nm NIR emission of the Er3+ ions increases with increasing Yb3+ concentration under excitation at 256 nm for the SiO2:y mol% Yb3+,1 mol% Er3+ (y = 0, 1, 5, 9, 14) inverse opals. These results demonstrate that the energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ takes place under excitation at 256 nm. The excitation spectra monitored by the 1534 nm NIR emission of SiO2:Er3+,Yb3+ inverse opals are exhibited in Fig. 3(c) and (d). The 378 and 520 nm excitation peaks were attributed to the 4I15/2 → 4G11/2 and 4I15/2 → 2H11/2 transitions of Er3+ ions in the Er3+ single-doped and Yb3+,Er3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals, respectively. A sharp, weak 256 nm excitation peak from the U → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ions was observed in the excitation spectra monitored by the 1534 nm NIR emission for the Er3+ single-doped SiO2 inverse opal, as shown in Fig. 3(d), which suggests that the observable 1534 nm NIR emission of the Er3+ single-doped SiO2 inverse opal exhibited in Fig. 3(b) arises from the direct excitation of Er3+. After co-doping with Yb3+, a broad and intense excitation band at 256 nm was obtained in all the excitation spectra monitored by the 1534 nm NIR emission, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d); this arises from the Yb3+–O2− CTS, as exhibited in the above discussion. The 256 nm excitation band was observed in the Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals; its intensity increased initially and then decreased with increasing Er3+ and Yb3+ concentration. These results further suggest that the energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ takes place under excitation at 256 nm.

The decay curves of the NIR emission at 976 nm for the SiO2:9 mol% Yb3+,x mol% Er3+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2) inverse opals were measured under excitation at 256 nm, as shown in Fig. 4(a). Due to the energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+, the decay curve of the 976 nm NIR emission cannot fitted by the single exponential equation for the SiO2:9 mol% Yb3+,x mol% Er3+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2) inverse opals. All the decay curves were fitted by the double exponential equation: (1)where I, t, A1 and A2 are the luminescence intensity, time and fitting parameters, respectively; τ1 and τ2 are the luminescence decay lifetimes. The following equation was used to calculate the decay average lifetime (τ) according to the τ1 and τ2 values obtained by the above eqn (1): (2)
 Fig. 4  (a) 976 nm decay curves of SiO2:9 mol% Yb3+,x mol% Er3+ inverse opals excited at 256 nm; (b) the mechanism of energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+. 
The decay lifetimes of the SiO2:9 mol% Yb3+,x mol% Er3+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2) inverse opals were determined to be 516, 255, 171, 108 and 54 μs, respectively. The luminescence lifetimes decreased from 516 to 54 μs as the Er3+ concentration increased from 0 to 2 mol%, confirming the existence of energy transfer from Yb3+ ions to Er3+ ions under excitation at 256 nm. The mechanism of energy transfer from Yb3+ to Er3+ ions under excitation at 256 nm was proposed based on the energy levels of the Yb3+ and Er3+ ions, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Upon excitation at 256 nm, the 2F5/2 states of the Yb3+ ions were populated by the Yb3+–O2− charge transfer, resulting in NIR emission at 976 nm, which is attributed to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ ions. The 4I11/2 excited state of Er3+ ions was populated by the energy transfer process 2F5/2(Yb3+) + 4I15/2(Er3+) → 2F7/2 (Yb3+) + 4I11/2(Er3+). Non-radiative relaxation from the 4I11/2 state to the 4I13/2 state populated the 4I13/2 state. The NIR emission at 1534 nm was generated by the radiative transition from the 4I13/2 state to the 4I15/2 state.
For the excitation spectra monitored by the NIR emission at 976 nm for the Er3+ or Yb3+ single-doped SiO2 inverse opals, the excitation peaks at 378 and 520 nm were not observed, as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). It is interesting that sharp excitation peaks located at about 378 and 520 nm were observed in the excitation spectra of Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals monitored by the NIR emission at 976 nm; these arise from the 4I15/2 → 4G11/2 and 4I15/2 → 2H11/2 processes of Er3+ ions, respectively. The 378 and 520 nm excitation peaks of Er3+ ions were obtained by monitoring the 976 nm NIR emission of Yb3+, which indicated that energy transfer from Er3+ ions to Yb3+ ions may take place in the Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals. In order to demonstrate the energy transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+, the luminescence spectra of SiO2:9 mol% Yb3+,x mol% Er3+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2) and SiO2:y mol% Yb3+,1 mol% Er3+ (y = 0, 1, 5, 9, 14) under excitation at 378 and 520 nm were measured, as shown in Fig. 5(c)–(f). Under excitation at 378 or 520 nm, the NIR emission of Yb3+ at 976 nm was not obtained in the Er3+ single-doped SiO2 inverse opal, and only the 1534 nm emission of Er3+ was observed, as shown in Fig. 5(e) and (f). The typical 976 nm NIR emission of Yb3+ and the 1534 nm NIR emission of Er3+ were observed in the Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals. It can be noted from Fig. 5(c) and (d) that the 976 nm NIR emission intensity of Yb3+ in SiO2:9 mol% Yb3+,x mol% Er3+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2) increased with increasing concentration of Er3+ ions upon excitation at 378 or 520 nm. Meanwhile, the NIR emission intensity of Er3+ at 1534 nm in the SiO2:y mol% Yb3+,1 mol% Er3+ (y = 0, 1, 5, 9, 14) decreased with increasing concentration of Yb3+ ions upon excitation at 378 or 520 nm, as shown in Fig. 5(e) and (f). These results further demonstrate that the energy transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+ occurs upon excitation at 378 or 520 nm.

Under excitation at 378 and 520 nm, it is well known that the traditional energy transfer mechanism from Er3+ to Yb3+ occurs when the Er3+ ion in the excited state transfers its energy to two Yb3+ ions through the path of Er3+(2H11/2/4S3/2) + 2Yb3+(2F7/2)–Er3+(4I15/2) + 2Yb3+(2F5/2); the QC NIR emission of Yb3+ ions is then obtained by the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of the excited Yb3+ ions. In order to demonstrate this mechanism, the visible luminescence spectra of SiO2:9 mol% Yb3+,x mol% Er3+ (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2) and SiO2:y mol% Yb3+,1 mol% Er3+ (y = 0, 1, 5, 9, 14) inverse opals were measured upon excitation at 378 nm, as shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b). Under excitation at 520 nm, the visible emission of Er3+ was not observed in the SiO2:Yb3+,Er3+ inverse opals, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6(a). No visible emission of Er3+ was observed in the SiO2:Yb3+,Er3+ inverse opals. The Er3+(2H11/2/4S3/2) + 2Yb3+(2F7/2) → Er3+(4I15/2) + 2Yb3+(2F5/2) QC path from Er3+ to Yb3+ can result in NIR emission of Yb3+ at 976 nm, which was demonstrated in previous investigations. In these previous investigations, visible emission of Er3+ was observed, and its emission intensity decreased with increasing Yb3+ concentration.11 However, in the present work, visible emission of Er3+ was not observed in the SiO2:Yb3+,Er3+ inverse opals, which suggests that the energy transfer process from Er3+ to Yb3+ does not follow the traditional QC path of Er3+(2H11/2/4S3/2) + 2Yb3+(2F7/2) → Er3+(4I15/2) + 2Yb3+(2F5/2) for the SiO2:Yb3+,Er3+ inverse opals. A novel mechanism was proposed for the near infrared luminescence at 976 and 1534 nm in the Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals under excitation at 378 and 520 nm, as shown in Fig. 7. The 4G11/2 state was populated under excitation at 378 nm. Cross-relaxation energy transfer through the path of Er3+(4G11/2) + Er3+(4I15/2) → Er3+(4I13/2) + Er3+(4F7/2) populated the 4I13/2 level. The 1534 nm near infrared luminescence in the Er3+ single-doped SiO2 inverse opal was obtained by radiative transition from the 4I13/2 state to the 4I15/2 state. Under excitation at 520 nm, the 2H11/2 state of Er3+ was populated. The 4I13/2 level was populated by the cross-relaxation energy transfer process Er3+(2H11/2) + Er3+(4I15/2) → Er3+(4I13/2) + Er3+(4I9/2), resulting in the near infrared luminescence at 1534 nm. It is noted that the NIR emission at around 976 nm from Yb3+ ions was observed under excitation at 378 or 520 nm in the Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals, which is not due to the traditional Er3+(2H11/2/4S3/2) + 2Yb3+(2F7/2) → Er3+(4I15/2) + 2Yb3+(2F5/2) QC energy transfer process from Er3+ to Yb3+. Additionally, in the Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals, the 976 nm NIR luminescence of Yb3+ ions may not arise from the energy transfer mechanism through the path of Er3+(4I13/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Er3+(4I15/2) + Yb3+(2F5/2) between the Er3+ and Yb3+ ions upon excitation at 378 or 520 nm because the energy between the 4I13/2 and the 4I15/2 states of Er3+ is smaller than that between the 2F7/2 and 2F5/2 states of Yb3+. Based on the energy level, the cross-relaxation energy transfer process is responsible for the 976 nm NIR emissions of Yb3+ ions upon excitation at 378 or 520 nm. As shown in Fig. 7, the 4G11/2 state was populated upon excitation at 378 nm. The cross-relaxation energy transfer processes of Er3+(4G11/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4F9/2) and Er3+(4F9/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4I13/2) can populate the 2F5/2 state of Yb3+. Upon excitation at 520 nm, the cross-relaxation energy transfer processes of Er3+(2H11/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4I11/2) can populate the 2F5/2 state of Yb3+. The radiative transition from the 2F5/2 state to the 2F7/2 state of Yb3+ produces the NIR emission at 976 nm.

 Fig. 7  Mechanism of near infrared luminescence at 976 and 1534 nm in the Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals under excitation at 378 and 520 nm. 
Because the energy between the 4I13/2 and the 4I15/2 states of Er3+ is smaller than that between the 2F7/2 and 2F5/2 states of Yb3+, the energy transfer mechanism through the path of Er3+(4I13/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Er3+(4I15/2) + Yb3+(2F5/2) between the Er3+ and Yb3+ ions cannot occur in the Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals under excitation at 378 or 520 nm; this indicates that the 1534 nm NIR emission from the 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ should decrease after addition of Yb3+ ions, which is not consistent with the results shown in Fig. 5. A novel mechanism was proposed for the decrease in the 1534 nm NIR emission of the Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals. Under excitation at 378 nm, the cross-relaxation energy transfer of Er3+(4G11/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4F9/2) results in the 976 nm NIR emission of Yb3+, as shown in Fig. 7. In addition, the cross-relaxation energy transfer Er3+(4G11/2) + Er3+(4I15/2) → Er3+(4I13/2) + Er3+(4F7/2) leads to the 1534 nm NIR emission from the 4I13/2 level of Er3+. The Er3+(4G11/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4F9/2) and Er3+(4G11/2) + Er3+(4I15/2) → Er3+(4I13/2) + Er3+(4F7/2) cross-relaxation energy transfer paths are related to the 4G11/2 level and compete with each other. After the addition of Yb3+ ions to the Er3+ single-doped inverse opal, the energy loss path of Er3+(4G11/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4F9/2) cross-relaxation energy transfer was opened. Thus, the 1534 nm NIR emission from the 4I13/2 level of Er3+ decreased with increasing Yb3+ concentration in the SiO2 inverse opal co-doped with Er3+ and Yb3+ ions. Under excitation at 520 nm, the NIR emissions at 976 and 1534 nm are attributed to the Er3+(2H11/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4I11/2) and Er3+(2H11/2) + Er3+(4I15/2) → Er3+(4I13/2) + Er3+(4I9/2) cross-relaxation energy transfers, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7. Two cross-relaxation energy transfer paths related to the 2H11/2 level compete with each other. The open energy loss path of Er3+(2H11/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4I11/2) in the Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals results in a decrease in the 1534 nm NIR emission of Er3+.
3.2 Upconversion photoluminescence of Yb3+ single-doped and Er3+,Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals
The UCL spectra of the SiO2 inverse opals single-doped with various Yb3+ concentrations were measured under excitation at 980 nm, as shown in Fig. 8(a). It is interesting that the Yb3+ single-doped SiO2 inverse opals exhibited a UCL band located at 500 nm. The luminescence spectrum of pure SiO2 inverse opal without Yb3+ ions was measured and is shown in Fig. 8(a); no 500 nm emission is exhibited. These results demonstrate that the UCL band located at 500 nm can be attributed to the doped Yb3+. The UCL band at 500 nm is attributed to the cooperative emission of two Yb3+ ions in the Yb3+ single-doped SiO2 inverse opals. The integrated intensity of the 500 nm UC emission of SiO2:5mol% Yb inverse opal as a function of excitation power is shown in Fig. 8(b). It can be observed that a two-photon process is responsible for the 500 nm UCL. The mechanism of UCL of SiO2:Yb3+ inverse opal is shown in Fig. 8(c). The 980 nm near infrared photons were absorbed by the Yb3+ ions, resulting in the population of the 2F5/2 excited states of the Yb3+ ions. The excited Yb3+–Yb3+ pair was formed by the interaction between two Yb3+ ions, resulting in the cooperative UCL at 500 nm. The UCL intensity was characterized as a function of the concentration of Yb3+, as shown in the inset of Fig. 8(a). The UCL intensity of the Yb3+ ions increased initially and then decreased with increasing Yb3+ ion concentration. The increasing UCL intensity is attributed to the formation of more Yb3+–Yb3+ pairs with increasing Yb3+ concentration. When the concentration of Yb3+ was greater than 5 mol%, the UCL intensity decreased because of concentration quenching. The optimized concentration of Yb3+ is about 5 mol%.

(b) Integrated UCL intensity at 500 nm as a function of the excitation power of the SiO2:5 mol% Yb inverse opal; (c) the mechanism of cooperative UCL of SiO2:Yb3+ inverse opal. 
The UCL spectra of SiO2 inverse opals co-doped with Er3+ and Yb3+ ions were investigated under excitation at 980 nm, as shown in Fig. 9. Typical green UCL at 525 and 548 nm and red UCL at 662 nm of Er3+ were observed; these arise from the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions, respectively. It is notable that the cooperative UC emission of two Yb3+ ions was not observed in the SiO2 inverse opal co-doped with Er3+ and Yb3+ ions, in contrast to the Yb3+ single-doped SiO2 inverse opals, as shown in Fig. 9. This result indicates that the Yb3+ ions preferentially transfer their energy to the Er3+ ions in the Er3+ and Yb3+ co-doped SiO2 inverse opals, quenching the cooperative UCL. The influence of the concentrations of Yb3+ or Er3+ on the UCL were observed in the SiO2 inverse opal co-doped with Er3+ and Yb3+ ions. Due to concentration quenching, the optimum doping concentrations for Er3+ and Yb3+ ions are about 9 mol% and 1 mol% in the SiO2:Yb3+,Er3+ inverse opals, respectively. The UCL mechanism of SiO2:1 mol% Er3+ and 9 mol% Yb3+ inverse opal was investigated based on the dependence of the UCL intensity on the excitation power, as shown in Fig. 9(c). The green and red UCL are attributed to three and two-photon processes for SiO2:9 mol% Yb3+,1 mol% Er3+ inverse opal, respectively. The mechanisms of UCL are shown in Fig. 9(d). The Er3+ ions located at the ground state were excited to the excited state 4I11/2 by the energy transfer between Yb3+ and Er3+ ions. The 4I13/2 state was populated by the 4I11/2 level, which was excited to the 4F9/2 level. The electrons at the 4F9/2 level returned to the ground state, resulting in the two-photon red UCL. In addition, some of the electrons at the 4F9/2 level can relax to the 4I9/2 level. The electrons at the 4I9/2 level can be further excited to the 4F7/2 level. The depopulation of the 4F7/2 level populated the 2H11/2/4S3/2 levels, resulting in the three-photon green UCL.

In comparison with other materials, such as film, powder and glass, rare earth ion-doped inverse opal photonic crystals show modified photoluminescence due to the photonic band gap effect.33 The influence of the photonic band gap on the UCL of Er3+ and the energy transfer process between rare earth ions has been investigated and reported extensively.23,24 However, the influence of the photonic band gap on the cooperative UCL of two Yb3+ ions has not been reported. In the present work, two different SiO2:5 mol% Yb3+ inverse opals were prepared using 370 and 490 nm PS microspheres, respectively. The influence of the photonic band gap on the cooperative UCL of two Yb3+ ions was investigated. Fig. 10(a) exhibits the absorption spectra of the inverse opals prepared using the 370 and 490 nm PS microspheres. As shown in Fig. 10(a), the photonic band gaps (PBG) of the inverse opals prepared using the 370 and 490 nm PS microspheres were located at 500 and 675 nm, respectively. The inverse opals with tunable photonic band gaps were realized by changing the size of the PS microspheres. The Yb3+ single-doped inverse opals with photonic band gaps at 500 and 675 nm are denoted as PBG 500 and PBG 675, respectively. The UCL emission spectra of the PBG 500 and PBG 675 samples were measured under excitation at 980 nm, as shown in Fig. 10(b). Cooperative UCL of two Yb3+ ions was observed in the two different inverse opals. It is noted that the cooperative UCL of the Yb3+ single-doped inverse opals with a photonic band gap at 500 nm was suppressed in comparison with that of the Yb3+ single-doped inverse opals with a photonic band gap at 675 nm, which is attributed to the photon trap caused by the photonic band gap.

4. Conclusions
The Yb3+–O2− charge transfer state and cooperative emission of two Yb3+ ions in SiO2:Yb3+ inverse opal result in 976 nm near infrared and 500 nm upconversion emissions upon excitation at 256 and 980 nm, respectively. The 500 nm cooperative upconversion emission of the SiO2:Yb3+ inverse opal was suppressed, which is attributed to the photon trap created by the photonic band gap. For the SiO2:Er3+,Yb3+ inverse opals, near infrared emissions of Yb3+ at 976 nm and of Er3+ at 1534 nm were observed under excitation at 256, 378 and 520 nm, respectively. A novel mechanism was presented to explain the near infrared emissions of Yb3+ at 976 nm and of Er3+ at 1534 nm. Upon excitation at 378 nm, the near infrared emission of Yb3+ at 976 nm is attributed to the cross-relaxation energy transfer processes of Er3+(4G11/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4F9/2) and Er3+(4F9/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4I13/2), and the near infrared luminescence of Er3+ at 1534 nm arises from cross-relaxation energy transfer through the path of Er3+(4G11/2) + Er3+(4I15/2)–Er3+(4I13/2) + Er3+(4F7/2). Upon excitation at 520 nm, the 976 nm NIR emission of Yb3+ arises from the cross-relaxation energy transfer processes of Er3+(2H11/2) + Yb3+(2F7/2) → Yb3+(2F5/2) + Er3+(4I11/2), and the near infrared luminescence of Er3+ at 1534 nm is attributed to the cross-relaxation energy transfer process Er3+(2H11/2) + Er3+(4I15/2) → Er3+(4I13/2) + Er3+(4I9/2).
