    , Accepted 8th July 2015First published on 9th July 2015AbstractThe development of robust and low cost electrocatalysts with highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction capability remains a great challenge for widespread applications in water splitting. Here, spinel NiCo2O4 nanosheets grown on mildly oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been synthesized via a simple one-pot solution method. Compared with pure NiCo2O4, the as-prepared hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs composite exhibits superior OER catalytic properties, i.e. a more negative onset potential, a smaller Tafel slope and higher stability, which may be attributed to the enhanced conductivity of the hybrid, originating from the carbon nanotube substrate. Furthermore, the surface Co/Ni ratio of NiCo2O4/CNTs is changed by the synergistic reactivity between oxygen-enriched groups and metal ions, which improves the catalytic performance of NiCo2O4/CNTs. This electrocatalyst with enhanced OER performance may be a promising candidate for water splitting.
Introduction
With the ever-increasing depletion of fossil fuels and the continuing increase in environmental pollution, the development of alternative energy conversion or storage devices with high power and large energy densities is of particular significance.1,2 The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) enables many energy storage options such as electricity-driven and/or direct-solar water splitting as an important process, but its kinetics are sluggish even after being facilitated by noble-metal catalysts. In addition, the anodic reaction of the OER process is complex, with hydroxyl ions being consumed to produce oxygen and water molecules (4OH− ↔ O2 + 2H2O + 4e−), requiring a considerable overpotential under alkaline conditions.3,4 Hence, the practical implementation of water splitting is severely constrained by the limited efficiency of the OER.5–7 Thus, an important issue for the OER is the development of catalysts that can reduce the overpotential.
At present, noble-metal based catalysts such as IrO2 and RuO2 are the most active catalysts, but their widespread applications in real industry are hindered owing to their scarcity and high cost.8 Therefore, extensive research effort has been devoted to seeking inexpensive and efficient OER electrocatalysts with superior OER performances and sufficient stability. To date, it has been reported that spinel cobalt-based oxides are the most promising electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes, due to their prominent advantages of low price, ease of preparation, high activity, excellent stability and environmental friendliness.9–11 Furthermore, the electrocatalytic efficiency of Co3O4 could be improved by doping with metal ions, such as Fe, Zn, Cu and Ni.12–15 Among these materials, spinel binary nickel cobaltite, having various applications in the fields of lithium ion batteries,16,17 fuel cells,18,19 magnetic materials,20,21 electrochemical capacitors,22etc., has aroused much attention, and has been employed as a water oxidation catalyst because of its outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability under alkaline conditions.23,24 Ni doping enables NiCo2O4 to possess a much better electronic conductivity (at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of Co3O4) and more active sites for the OER.25,26 More importantly, due to the different valence states in the spinel structure where Ni occupies the octahedral sites and Co occupies both the octahedral and the tetrahedral sites, both redox couples (i.e. Co3+/Co2+ and Ni3+/Ni2+) ensure a notable electrocatalytic activity. Despite the improved catalytic activity of NiCo2O4, it is highly desirable to further enhance its catalytic performance for practical applications. By virtue of their reinforced synergistic effects, one of the most effective strategies is depositing NiCo2O4 on conductive supports with excellent conductivity and high surface area.27
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), as an important class of nanocarbon material, have excellent conductivity, high specific surface area, chemical stability, very high strength and low density, making them useful substrates to produce hybrid and composite materials for various applications. In particular, many multi-walled CNT based composites have been explored as advanced electrocatalysts.28–30 For OER application, a variety of transition metal compounds, such as the non-precious metal compounds,31 MnO2,32 and MnCo2O4,33 have been grown on CNTs in attempts to boost the OER catalysis, and this has been demonstrated to be a feasible and effective approach. Therefore, constructing a NiCo2O4/CNTs composite with a hierarchical structure could lead to an attractive potential OER electrocatalyst. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no report on the synergistic catalytic mechanism of NiCo2O4/CNTs in the OER process.
Herein, we report spinel NiCo2O4 on oxidized multi-walled CNTs as an active electrocatalyst for OER synthesized by a facile solution method. The introduced multi-walled CNTs could provide a huge surface area for the growth of NiCo2O4 nanosheets and contribute to their outstanding conductivity. Benefiting from these features, the hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs composite exhibits superior OER catalysis compared with pure NiCo2O4 and an NiCo2O4/activated carbon (AC) composite. To gain insight into the growth mechanism of NiCo2O4 on CNTs, multi-walled CNTs both with and without oxidation are adopted as substrates. The comparison of the results indicates that the oxidation pre-treatment of CNTs with oxygen-enriched groups like –OH and –COOH plays an essential role in modifying the surface of NiCo2O4, leading to an increased ratio of Co/Ni in the NiCo2O4/CNTs composite, as well as further enhanced OER activity. The superior performance is credited to the unique micro-structure and the prominent synergistic effects of the components. In view of the highly improved catalytic efficiency in the OER, the NiCo2O4/CNTs composite proves to be a very promising candidate as an electrocatalyst for water splitting.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
All reagents used in the experiment were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (99% AR), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (99% AR) and active carbon were obtained from Guangzhou Chemical Reagent Factory and Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagent Factory, respectively. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, 99% AR) and NH3·H2O (25–28 wt%) were obtained from Shanghai Tianlian Fine Chemical Co. Ltd and Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co. Ltd, respectively. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs, 99% AR) were purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co. Ltd.
Oxidation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes
1 g of multi-walled CNTs was purified by washing with 70 mL of diluted hydrochloric acid (10 wt%) to remove metal residues. The products were then filtered, washed and dried. After that, 23 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid was added to the purified multi-walled CNTs in a 250 mL round-bottom flask, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. Next, the solution was transferred to an oil bath. After its temperature was raised to 40 °C, 416 mg of KNO3 was added, followed by the slow addition of 1 g of KMnO4 while keeping the reaction temperature below 45 °C. The solution was stirred at 40 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, 3 mL of water was added to the flask, followed by another 3 mL of water after 5 minutes. After another 5 minutes, 40 mL of water was added. 15 minutes later, the flask was removed from the oil bath and 140 mL of water and 10 mL of 30% H2O2 were added to terminate the oxidation reaction. The oxidized multi-walled CNTs were collected, repetitively washed with 5% HCl solution and water, and finally lyophilized. The yield of the oxidized carbon nanotubes was 86.5%.
Synthesis of NiCo2O4 nanosheets on oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes
In a typical solution process, 0.58 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 1.16 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O were dissolved in 50 mL H2O to form a clear purple solution, which was mixed with 0.35 g PVP. After that, 0.21 g of oxidized multi-walled CNTs powder was uniformly dispersed in the aqueous solution with the assistance of ultrasonication at 400 W for 0.5 h. Then, NH3·H2O (5%) was added dropwise until its pH reached 9. The obtained precipitate was filtered, washed with water and ethanol several times to remove the surfactant and residual ions, and dried at 70 °C for 12 h under vacuum. Finally, the hybrid precursor was annealed in air at 200 °C for 3 h with a slow heating rate of 1 °C min−1. The yield of the catalyst was 95%. The obtained catalyst (NiCo2O4: 70 wt%) is denoted as NiCo2O4/CNTs. Hybrids with NiCo2O4 contents of 90, 80, 60, and 50 wt% were prepared by a similar method. For comparison, NiCo2O4 (70 wt%) grown on activated carbon (denoted as NiCo2O4/AC) was synthesized by a similar synthesis procedure except that the oxidized multi-walled CNTs were substituted by AC. NiCo2O4 (70 wt%) grown on pristine multi-walled CNTs (denoted as NiCo2O4/pCNTs) was synthesized through a similar method except using multi-walled CNTs with no pre-treatment. Bare NiCo2O4 was prepared by a similar synthesis procedure without the addition of the oxidized multi-walled CNTs. In addition, a physical mixture of NiCo2O4 and CNTs was also prepared. The calcined spinel NiCo2O4 (0.21 g) was physically mixed with 30 wt% CNTs (0.09 g). The mixture was heated under a nitrogen flow at 200 °C for 1 h and allowed to cool naturally to room temperature.
Characterization
The surface morphology and structure of the as-prepared samples were analyzed by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Quanta 400) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, 300 kV, Tecnai™ G2 F30). The structures of the samples were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker, D8 ADVANCE) with Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The chemical-state analysis of the samples was carried out using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALab250). The specific surface area and the pore size distribution of the samples were investigated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, SDT 2960) was used to estimate the mass content of carbon in the NiCo2O4/CNTs.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared samples were investigated by employing a CHI 760D electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai) in a three-compartment cell with a Pt plate counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode, and a working electrode. The electrolyte was a 1 M aqueous solution of KOH. The working electrode was prepared as follows: 20 mg of the catalyst was dispersed in 100 mL of DI water, and 45 mL of PTFE was added. The contents were dispersed, followed by ultrasonication for approximately 30 min to obtain a homogeneous suspension. 0.48 mL of the catalyst ink was dropped on the surface of a glassy carbon disk (working electrode) and dried at room temperature, leading to a catalyst loading of 0.2 mg cm−2. Polarization curves were recorded with a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. The working electrodes were scanned several times until the signals stabilized, and then the data were collected. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in the range of 0 to 0.5 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 0.10 MHz at 0.56 V. The stability was characterized by chronoamperometry which was carried out at 0.56 V. Tafel slopes were derived from the polarization curves. The Tafel slope was calculated according to the Tafel equation as follows: η = a + blogj, where η denotes the overpotential, a denotes the Tafel constant, b denotes the Tafel slope, and j denotes the current density. The overpotential was calculated as follows: η = E (vs. SCE) − 0.16, considering the O2/OH− equilibrium in 1 M KOH solution at 0.16 V vs. SCE.

Results and discussion
The mechanism of the NiCo2O4 growth is shown in Scheme 1. It is well known that the external carbon-net of multi-walled CNTs has some breaches, on which oxygen-enriched groups such as hydroxyl and carbonyl exist (state I). Accompanying the oxidation, more gaps are breached and the amount of these kinds functional groups increases.34 Amongst these oxygen-enriched groups, the carboxyl group, the main functional group in oxidized multi-walled CNTs, has the ability to coordinate with Ni2+ cations and Co2+ cations (state II). With the addition of ammonium hydroxide drop by drop, the metal cations near the carboxyl groups generate a precipitate (state III).31 After the functional groups are covered, the remaining metal cations finally generate another kind of precipitate which wraps around the former one (state IV).

XRD measurements were used to identify the chemical composition and the phase of the NiCo2O4/CNTs composite. As presented in Fig. 1, the obtained diffraction peaks match well with the standard patterns of the spinel NiCo2O4 phase (JCPDS card no. 20-0781) and no other peaks are observed, which effectively confirms that the one-dimensional multi-walled CNTs were completely wrapped by NiCo2O4. However, when the NiCo2O4 content decreases to a certain value, the XRD features of CNTs can be observed (Fig. S1†).

The morphology of the hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs composite was observed by SEM and TEM shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, numerous nanosheets grow well around the individual multi-walled CNTs to form a flower-like coating on the surface. Moreover, the mutual contact indicates that the nanosheets grow not only on the individual CNTs but also at the contact sites between CNTs, forming a better conductive network. This hierarchical nanostructure, maintaining a conductive core, may be remarkably beneficial for the improvement of the specific surface area, which is of great importance to the electrochemical performance of electrode materials. Moreover, the interior structure of the hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs composite was further investigated by TEM (Fig. 2c–e). It can be clearly observed that ultrathin nanosheets with large lateral size (around 100 nm width) grow around the multi-walled CNT core. Such characteristics confirm the intimate contact between the nanosheets and the multi-walled CNT scaffold. The corresponding HRTEM image of the hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs composite in Fig. 2f shows lattice fringes with an interlayer distance of 0.29 nm, which corresponds to the (220) plane of NiCo2O4. EDX elemental mapping analysis in Fig. 3 clearly presents the composition and uniform distribution of cobalt and nickel of the NiCo2O4/CNTs nanostructure throughout the hierarchical nanosheets, implying that the nanosheet is typical spinel NiCo2O4 rather than the simple mixing of cobalt oxide and nickel oxide. Fig. 3 also reveals that the multi-walled CNTs were completely wrapped by the NiCo2O4. For comparison, the morphology of pure NiCo2O4 is also presented in Fig. S2.† As shown, the pure NiCo2O4 is comprised of nanosheets as well. However, it is clearly seen that the nanosheets agglomerate with each other without the multi-walled CNTs acting as a bone for the growth of NiCo2O4 nanosheets, resulting in a low specific surface area. This conclusion can be further confirmed by specific surface area measurements. As revealed by nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements, the hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs composite has a high BET specific surface area of about 170 m2 g−1 with a broad pore-size distribution and a large pore volume of 0.7 cm3 g−1 (Fig. 4a). The pure NiCo2O4 has a relatively low BET specific surface area of about 105 m2 g−1 and a small pore volume of 0.4 cm3 g−1 (Fig. S3†). This result provides additional proof that the higher specific area is induced by the multi-walled CNTs.

TGA/DTG measurements were used to evaluate the functional relationship between the mass change and the temperature (Fig. 4b). As can be seen, only a slight weight loss occurs before 200 °C, implying that CNTs including oxygen-enriched groups could be retained during the annealing process at 200 °C for 3 h in air. A weight loss of about 12 wt% occurs from 210 °C to 245 °C, with the DTG peak at about 225 °C. This result can be attributed to the oxidation of the carboxyl groups. In addition, a weight loss of about 15 wt% in the temperature range between 245 °C and 468 °C arises in the TG curve with a peak existing at about 400 °C in the DTG curve, which is attributed to the reaction between CNTs and O2.35
The electrochemical performance of the hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs composite was investigated, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a shows a comparison of the CV curves of the hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs composite, NiCo2O4/AC, the physical mixture of NiCo2O4 and CNTs (NiCo2O4 + CNTs) and pure NiCo2O4. Obviously, the hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs has similar features of redox peaks and OER onset potential to NiCo2O4/AC, while the curve of the pure NiCo2O4 is quite different. The negative shift of the redox peaks and the onset potential may be attributed to the enhancement of conductivity by the carbon substrate. In addition, the CV curve of NiCo2O4/CNTs has additional redox peaks at 0.2 V compared to NiCo2O4/AC, which will be explained below. Notably, the curve of NiCo2O4 + CNTs possesses similar features compared to that of pure NiCo2O4, implying the weak synergetic effect between NiCo2O4 and CNTs in the physical mixture catalyst. Besides, the order of area sizes covered by the CV curve is listed as follows: NiCo2O4/CNTs > NiCo2O4/AC > NiCo2O4 + CNTs > pure NiCo2O4. This can be accounted for by two reasons: (1) the carbon-substrate hybrid, with the enhancement of electrical conductivity induced by the carbon substrate, has a higher capacitance than pure NiCo2O4; (2) the diversity of carbon materials, the multi-walled CNTs with a carbon-net structure accelerates charge transfer, but AC agglomerates bind together.

Polarization curves were further employed to evaluate the OER kinetics of the catalysts. Fig. S4† shows that the OER activities are optimized for the hybrid catalyst consisting of 70 wt% NiCo2O4 and 30 wt% CNTs. Notably, even after the content of NiCo2O4 drops to 50 wt%, the hybrid maintains excellent performance compared to the pure NiCo2O4. As shown in Fig. 5b, the NiCo2O4/CNTs composite has a similar onset (about 0.5 V) to NiCo2O4/AC. However, it has a higher current density of about 83 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V, three times higher than that of NiCo2O4/AC which declines dramatically at high potential. This result can be ascribed to the enhancement of the charge transfer, which was accelerated by the mutual contact of the carbon-net of the multi-walled CNTs. In comparison, the accumulation of activated carbon existing separately induces the interruption of the charge transfer. Furthermore, the NiCo2O4 on AC agglomerated easily so that NiCo2O4/AC contains a lower number of effective or accessible OER active sites. In Fig. 5b, the pure NiCo2O4 and the multi-walled CNTs show OER activity as well, but neither the onset potential nor the current density is comparable to the NiCo2O4/CNTs composite. In addition, the physical mixture catalyst possesses poor OER activity, even worse than that of pure NiCo2O4. This result further confirms the weak synergetic effect in the catalyst. Thus, only NiCo2O4 plays a role in the OER catalytic effect in this physically mixed catalyst. With decreasing NiCo2O4 content, the OER activity declines simultaneously. The OER kinetics of the above catalysts are estimated from the corresponding Tafel plots (logj − η) in which the Tafel slope for NiCo2O4/CNTs is about 68.1 mV dec−1, while it is 70 mV dec−1 for NiCo2O4/AC, 79.0 mV dec−1 for NiCo2O4 + CNTs, and 77.3 mV dec−1 for the pure NiCo2O4 (Fig. 5c and Table S1†). The results demonstrate that NiCo2O4/CNTs possesses efficient kinetics for water oxidation. Since the OER activity of NiCo2O4/CNTs exhibits a more negative onset potential, higher current and a lower Tafel slope, the integration of NiCo2O4 with CNTs is of benefit for a superior OER catalyst.
Ionic and charge transport are also essential factors for efficient electrochemical OER catalysts. In order to gain insight into the behavior of NiCo2O4/CNTs during oxygen evolution, Nyquist plots of the EIS spectra obtained at 0.56 V are shown in Fig. 5d. The inset shows the equivalent circuit used to obtain the charge transfer resistance of the OER catalysts. Rs is the resistance of the electrolyte. Rf is the resistance of the catalyst layer and Cf is the capacitance. Cdl is the double layer capacitance and Rct is the charge transfer resistance. In the high frequency region, the resistance is related to the uncompensated solution resistance, which is comparable for all catalysts.36 The charge transfer resistances (Rct) obtained from the fitted equivalent circuit give an interpretation of the reaction kinetics. The hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs composite shows much lower charge transfer resistance of about 6.9 Ω, while NiCo2O4/AC has an intermediate charge transfer resistance (11.1 Ω), and the pure NiCo2O4 exhibits the highest resistance of 46.0 Ω. Rct follows the order: NiCo2O4/CNTs < NiCo2O4/AC < NiCo2O4 + CNTs < pure NiCo2O4. This result may be mainly attributed to the high electrical conductivity of the multi-walled CNTs. To determine the coulombic efficiency of the OER catalyzed by NiCo2O4/CNTs, the amount of oxygen produced during electrolysis at 0.01 A was measured over 1 hour (Fig. S5†). The amount of oxygen produced matches well with the charge consumed, assuming 4 electrons for one O2. This result indicates that NiCo2O4/CNTs possesses a high coulombic efficiency for the OER process.
In order to further investigate the function of the oxygen-enriched groups, XPS measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. 6, the Co 2p emission spectra of the three samples were best fitted with two spin–orbit doublets and two shakeup satellites (identified as “Sat.”), where peaks at about 794.75 eV and 779 eV are ascribed to Co3+, whereas peaks at about 796.5 eV and 781 eV are associated with Co2+.37 Clearly, two kinds of Ni species can be observed with peaks at about 871 eV and 855.5 eV ascribed to Ni3+, and peaks at about 873 eV and 854 eV pertaining to Ni2+.38 The spectrum for the O 1s region shows three contributions in all the samples except for NiCo2O4/CNTs which shows four contributions. The fitting peak at 529.5 eV is typical of metal–oxygen bonds.39 Sitting at 531 eV, the component is usually associated with oxygen in OH− groups, indicating that the sample is hydroxylated to some extent as a result of either surface hydroxides or substitution of oxygen atoms at the surface by hydroxyl groups.40,41 The well-resolved peak around 532.4 eV corresponds to the multiplicity of physi/chemisorbed water at the surface or the CO and O–CO bonds.42 Notably, the peak at 528.1 eV is present in NiCo2O4/CNTs, which may correspond to the lattice oxygen in MO2 (M = Ni or Co), an active intermediate product for the OER, caused by the establishment of carboxyl–metal coordination reducing the electron cloud density around the metal. Fig. 6d displays the C 1s spectra of NiCo2O4/CNTs and NiCo2O4/pCNTs. Previous studies assigned the binding energy of the C–C and C–H bonds to be 284.5–285 eV, while peaks at 285.5 eV and 288 eV were assigned to carbon-net defects, attributed to the C atoms no longer in the regular tubular structure and different oxygen-containing moieties, respectively.43,44 Obviously, the C 1s peak of NiCo2O4/CNTs shows two remarkable differences compared to NiCo2O4/pCNTs: the carbon-net defect peak is broader and a new peak arises at around 283.1 eV which may be attributed to C–C bonds in carbide. Table S2† gives a summary of the XPS data for NiCo2O4/CNTs, NiCo2O4/pCNTs, and the pure NiCo2O4. It can be clearly observed that NiCo2O4/CNTs have the largest proportion of Co/Ni. On the other hand, the Co3+/Co2+ ratio in these three samples is similar, yet the Ni3+/Ni2+ is quite distinctive in that the highest proportion belongs to the pure NiCo2O4 and the proportions in the other two samples are 2:1 and 1:1, respectively. These results can be mainly attributed to the difference in the ratio of Co/Ni in the surface layer among these samples, and the cobalt oxide covering the outer surface of NiCo2O4/CNTs preventing the oxidation of Ni2+.
 Fig. 6  XPS spectra for the hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs and NiCo2O4/pCNTs. 
A proposed mechanism for the surface layer combination is presented in Scheme S1.† When the functional groups are absent at the surface of CNTs [Scheme S1(I)†], the ratio of Co/Ni in the hydroxide precipitation is 2:1, and the corresponding composition is homogeneous. However, after the oxidation, the carboxyl groups with coordination ability to Ni and Co alter the proportion of these two species which leads to a 1:1 ratio. The assembly of Co and Ni is conducted according to the remaining proportion of Co/Ni, forming another hydroxide layer where the Co/Ni ratio is inhomogeneous [Scheme S1(II)†]. However, once the amount of functional groups decreases on the pristine multi-walled CNTs, the consumption of the coordinated Co and Ni will reduce with little impact on the Co/Ni ratio [Scheme S1(III)†].
The difference in electrocatalytic performance caused by the surface Co/Ni ratio between NiCo2O4/CNTs and NiCo2O4/pCNTs is probed in OER electrocatalysis. Firstly, we recorded CV curves in saturated 1 M KOH with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in Fig. 7a. Both hybrids show a similar redox couple (Ia/Ib), but NiCo2O4/CNTs has a second redox couple (IIa/IIb). The generation of the redox peaks IIa/IIb may be attributed to the increase in the metal ion valence state, which was increased through the presence of numerous carboxyl groups on the multi-walled CNTs which decreased the density of the metal electron cloud. The redox couples can be assigned to:45Ia/Ib: MO + OH− ↔ MOOH + e−IIa/IIb: MOOH + OH− ↔ MO2 + H2O + e−IIIa/IIIb: 2MO2 → 2MO + O2
 Fig. 7  (a) CV curves for NiCo2O4/CNTs and NiCo2O4/pCNTs; (b) polarization curves for NiCo2O4/CNTs and NiCo2O4/pCNTs. 
Secondly, the OER pathways catalyzed by NiCo2O4/CNTs and NiCo2O4/pCNTs were investigated in Fig. 7b. NiCo2O4/CNTs exhibits a significantly higher OER current density than NiCo2O4/pCNTs. As previously reported, the surface of Co undergoes progressive oxidation with the formation of Co4+ species, at which oxygen evolution occurs. Thus, with the existence of the oxygen-enriched groups on the CNTs increasing the number of some essential intermediates, the abundance of cobalt oxide and MO2 existing on the surface of NiCo2O4/CNTs opens up more active sites for the OER process and improves the electrocatalytic activity.46
High stability toward OER is of great significance for energy conversion and storage systems, and the chronoamperometric technique is an effective means to examine the electrochemical stability of an electrocatalyst. The long-term electrochemical stability of NiCo2O4/CNTs, NiCo2O4/AC, NiCo2O4 + CNTs and pure NiCo2O4 electrodes towards water splitting was investigated in a 1 M KOH solution at 0.56 V for 10 h. As presented in Fig. 8, NiCo2O4/CNTs exhibits a slight anodic current attenuation of 8% within 1 h, whereas NiCo2O4/AC and pure NiCo2O4 display a larger current attenuation of 40% and 27%, respectively. After 10 h, NiCo2O4/CNTs remained at higher current density (83%), revealing the high stability of NiCo2O4/CNTs. The SEM images of NiCo2O4/CNTs, NiCo2O4/AC and NiCo2O4 after the stability measurements are shown in the ESI (Fig. S7–S9†). As can be seen, after the stability measurements, the morphology of NiCo2O4/CNTs changed slightly. However, the morphology change of NiCo2O4/AC and NiCo2O4 is obvious. These results indicate the poor stability of NiCo2O4/AC and NiCo2O4. In addition, the XPS spectra of NiCo2O4/CNTs have also been tested (Fig. S10†). From the XPS spectra, NiCo2O4/CNTs still possessed a high ratio of Co/Ni (about 2.7) after the stability measurements. Moreover, the valence state ratio of Ni is 0.31 for Ni3+/Ni2+, and that of Co is 1.05 for Co3+/Co2+. Compared with the corresponding XPS results which were tested before the stability measurements, the slight change in the valence state and the ratio of Co/Ni at the surface further confirm the high stability of NiCo2O4/CNTs.

Conclusion
In summary, a hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs hybrid has been synthesized by a one-pot synthesis method. The selective nucleation of NiCo2O4 on CNTs was well controlled by readily adjusting the pH of solution. The as-prepared hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs composite exhibits superior OER activity and high stability, which can be mainly attributed to the remarkable conductivity, high specific surface area of CNTs and the synergistic effect between the oxygen-enriched groups and metal ions. This work offers a novel molecular-scale hybridization strategy to develop robust and low-cost catalysts with high catalytic efficiency and high durability for potential energy conversion and storage applications.
