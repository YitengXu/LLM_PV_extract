    , Accepted 14th September 2015First published on 6th October 2015AbstractCompared with the development of novel organic sensitizers, cosensitization is a much more convenient way to acquire panchromatic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Taking the strong absorption in the long wavelength region but the lack of response in the ranges of 350–410 nm and 500–600 nm of porphyrin dyes into account, the D–A–π–A benzotriazole organic dye (WS-5), showing strong absorption bands in these two ranges, is targeted for cosensitization with porphyrin dye XW4. The cosensitization effects on light-harvesting capability, photovoltaic performance, charge recombination as well as long-term stability have been investigated in detail, especially for the interactions between WS-5 and XW4 and their effects on photovoltaic performance. Noticeably, a strong panchromatic light response and a promising photovoltaic efficiency of 10.41% have been achieved with only 6 μm TiO2 films, which is obviously higher than the corresponding efficiencies obtained using a single sensitizer. The cosensitization is essentially dominated by WS-5 while only a small amount of XW4 is contributed to enhance the IPCE response in the long wavelength region. These results demonstrate the effective approach for utilizing porphyrin dyes to simultaneously fill up the absorption valleys of D–A–π–A featured sensitizers and promote the DSSC efficiency, presenting the effective strategy of cosensitization to combine the advantages of both porphyrin and organic dyes, especially for pursuing highly efficient panchromatic dye-sensitized solar cells.
Introduction
Organic sensitizers based on donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) motifs, one of the key components of DSSCs, have been extensively explored in the last decade due to their high molar extinction coefficients, rare-metal-free structures, and most importantly the facile molecular tailoring with tunable photovoltaic performances.1–3 However, compared to metal complex sensitizers, organic dyes generally bestow one narrow absorption band in the visible region, leading to serious energy waste.4–6 Recently, porphyrin dyes, possessing two major absorption bands in the visible region: a strong Soret band at around 450 nm and a relatively weak Q band at around 650 nm, have attracted considerable interest with a great breakthrough in power-conversion efficiency (PCE).7–9 To date, porphyrin dyes based on the D–π–A system are still the most successful kinds of organic sensitizers, such as GY50 (12.75%)10 and the record one SM315 (13.0%) based on cobalt electrolytes.11 However, even as efficient as GY50 and SM315 are, typical porphyrin dyes still have their intrinsic drawback: the extremely weak absorption in the region of 350–410 nm and 500–600 nm, which is difficult to be overcome by molecular engineering of the porphyrin structure.7 Thus, taking the respective advantage and disadvantage of organic sensitizers and porphyrin sensitizers into account, the cosensitization method,12–17 which has been exploited with one or more kinds of small dyes co-adsorbed onto the porphyrin-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, has attracted more and more attention. Besides the favorable π-aggregation prevention effect on the TiO2 surface,12b more importantly, the small dyes may also well complement the absorption spectra of porphyrin dyes.
As mentioned above, to be appropriate candidates for the cosensitization with porphyrin dyes, the small dyes should possess strong absorption in the ranges of 350–410 nm and 500–600 nm. Recently, a series of D–A–π–A indoline dyes with auxiliary acceptors were developed and applied as the highly efficient sensitizers in DSSCs (WS series).18–22 By screening different auxiliary acceptors with different electron withdrawing capabilities, the absorption band of these dyes can be shifted to a broad range. Among all these dyes, WS-5,19 with benzotriazole as an auxiliary acceptor, shows high light-harvesting capability in the region of 350–420 nm and 450–650 nm, which exactly complements the deficiencies of porphyrin dyes, suggesting that WS-5 may be a promising cosensitizer of porphyrin dyes. However, the spatial distribution and the intermolecular interactions between the co-adsorbed dyes, the adsorption competition, suitable size, shape, orientation and depth profile composition, are also key factors as well as light-harvest compensators in the cosensitization strategy.14 Among them, the adsorption competition is the most important factor, which affects the dye-loaded ratio directly. As a consequence, we are far from exploring a suitable couple of dyes to successfully cosensitize the TiO2 electrode with high efficiency.
With these concerns in mind, herein, WS-5 was cosensitized with an efficient porphyrin dye XW4 (Scheme 1),23 and the cosensitization effects on light-harvesting capability, photovoltaic performance, charge recombination, and long-term stability have been investigated in detail, especially for the interactions between WS-5 and XW4. Accordingly, the cosensitized cells achieved strong panchromatic light harvesting and the highest efficiency of 10.41% with only 6 μm TiO2 films, obviously higher than the corresponding efficiencies obtained using a single sensitizer. These results demonstrate the effective approach for utilizing D–A–π–A featured sensitizers to simultaneously fill up both of the absorption valleys of porphyrin dyes and promote the DSSC efficiency. Moreover, highly efficient panchromatic cosensitized DSSCs may be developed.

Experimental
Materials
The FTO conducting glass (OPV-FTO22-7, fluorine doped SnO2, sheet resistance 7–8 Ω per square, transmission 75–80%) was obtained from OPV Tech Co., Ltd. tert-Butylpyridine (TBP), titanium tetrachloride, lithium iodide, 1-methyl-3-propyl-imidazolium iodide (PMII), and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide were purchased from Adamas and used as received. Transparent TiO2 paste (18NR-T) was purchased from Dyesol Ltd. Light-scattering anatase particles were obtained from the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics. All other chemicals used were produced by J&K and used without further purification.
DSSC fabrication
All working electrodes used in this work were prepared and modified following the reported procedure.24 The films were then immersed into a 0.3 mM solution of WS-5 in a mixture of chloroform and ethanol (volume ratio of 1:1) at 25 °C for 12 h or a 0.2 mM solution of XW4 in a mixture of toluene and ethanol (volume ratio of 1:4) at 25 °C for 12 h. For co-sensitization, WS-5/XW4-sensitized films were washed with ethanol, dried in air, and then immersed in a solution containing WS-5/XW4 and kept at 25 °C for different time. The counter electrode was prepared by sputtering with three drops of 0.02 M H2PtCl6 in 2-propanol followed by annealing treatment at 400 °C for 15 min. A hole (diameter of 0.8 mm) was drilled on the counter electrode. For the assembly of DSSCs, the two electrodes were sandwiched using a 25 μm thick hot-melt gasket. The cell area was controlled to be 0.12 cm2 for photovoltaic performance measurements and 3.22 cm2 for photophysical and dye-loaded amount measurements. In this work, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propyl-imidazolium iodide (PMII), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile were used as the redox electrolyte. The quasi-solid-state electrolyte was obtained from HeptaChroma (DMPII/DMII/BMII/PMII). All data shown in this work were the average values of five parallel tests.
Photovoltaic performance measurements
The UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a CARY 100 spectrophotometer. The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves were obtained under AM 1.5G simulated solar light by illuminating the cell through the FTO substrate from the photoanode side. The voltage step and the delay time of the photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. The incident photon-to-charge carrier efficiencies (IPCEs) were obtained on a Newport-74125 system (Newport instruments). The intensity of monochromatic light was detected using a Si detector (Newport-71640). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of all DSSCs were performed using a Zahner IM6e Impedance Analyzer (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & CoKG, Kronach, Germany), with a frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz and an alternative signal of 5 mV. The bias potential varied between 600 and 800 mV with about a 50 mV progressive increase, and the spectra were characterized using Z-View software. The aging time test was measured in air under visible-light soaking at 25 °C.
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a, XW4 bestows an intense Soret band in the range of 400–480 nm and less intense Q bands in the range of 630–700 nm, with very weak absorption between 350 and 400 nm, as well as between 480 and 630 nm, which are typical features of porphyrins in the absorption spectrum. In contrast, cosensitizer WS-5 demonstrates a broad absorption bands at around 390 and 500 nm,19 which compensate well the poor absorption of XW4. Moreover, the absorption spectra of WS-5 and XW4 on the TiO2 film are shown in Fig. 1b. Although the absorption peaks of WS-5 and XW4 are bathochromically shifted relative to those in solution, the absorption bands of both dyes are broadened obviously. Furthermore, according to their absorption spectra on the TiO2 film, WS-5 and XW4 maybe a promising couple for the cosensitization application. Thus, in view of spectrum compensation, the absorbance as a function of dipping time was measured firstly for XW4, WS-5, and cosensitized one, respectively, to optimize the cosensitization procedure (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of dyes WS-5 and XW4: (a) in THF and (b) anchored on a 3 μm TiO2 film. 
 Fig. 2  Absorbance as a function of dipping time for XW4-sensitizer, WS-5-sensitizer, and mixture cosensitized one on a 6 μm transparent TiO2 film. 
After 12 h of adsorption in XW4, the absorbance of the dye-loaded TiO2 electrode remained at the same level, meaning that XW4 needs over 12 h to reach its saturated adsorption (Fig. 2a). In the case of WS-5, the saturated adsorption duration was only around 4 h. To be noticed, after dipping for only 2 h, 97% of saturated adsorption has been achieved by WS-5, showing a much faster adsorption rate with respect to XW4. Obviously, WS-5 much more easily adsorbs on the TiO2 surface, that is, if the TiO2 electrode was sensitized by WS-5 first or sensitized in WS-5/XW4 mixed solution, XW4 was difficult to compete with WS-5 and adsorb sufficiently on the TiO2 electrode. Thus, in the following optimization and evaluation, the TiO2 electrodes were prepared by dipping in XW4 solution for 12 h and then dipping in WS-5 solution for different periods.
To further investigate the adsorption behavior of XW4 and WS-5, the corresponding absorption spectra of XW4-sensitized TiO2 dipped in WS-5 solution for different time were recorded (Fig. 2c). The absorbance of the Q band of XW4 quickly decreased to around half of the original value after dipping in WS-5 solution for only 0.5 h, indicating that except for the adsorption on the unoccupied TiO2 surface, a fierce competition took place between WS-5 and XW4, and XW4 was quickly replaced by WS-5. Accordingly, along with the increase of absorption in the region of 500–600 nm, the light harvesting capability in the long wavelength region originated from the serious decrease of XW4. Thus, the increase in short wavelength and the decrease in long wavelength should be well balanced to obtain the best performance. The IPCE action spectra of all these cosensitization electrodes were recorded and are shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  IPCE as a function of wavelength for different WS-5/XW4 cosensitized DSSCs. The TiO2 electrodes consist of a 6 μm transparent layer and an 8 μm scattering layer. 
Upon cosensitization with WS-5 for 0.5 h, the IPCE values in the range of 350–650 nm have been effectively improved due to the strong light conversion capability of WS-5 in this range. Besides, a quite interesting tendency of the IPCE value at 680 nm has also been observed. With the cosensitization of WS-5 for 0–1.0 h, the IPCE680nm value increased from 54% to the maximum value of 68%. However, when the dipping time was continually extended to 4 h, a negative contribution to the IPCE has been observed, that is the IPCE680nm value gradually decreased to be only 40%. It is indicative that WS-5 replaces XW4 on the surface of TiO2 due to its higher adsorption capacity, which is consistent with the results of absorption spectra.12,15 As a result, after cosensitizing with WS-5 for only 0.5 h, the Jsc value successfully realized a huge increase from 13.01 to 19.36 mA cm−2 (Table 1). Obviously, except for the complement of the light response area, WS-5 also acted as a co-absorbent material, such as DCA, to break the π-aggregation of XW4 on the surface of the TiO2 electrode. Along with the increase of the dipping time from 0.5 to 2.0 h, the Jsc value slightly enhanced from 19.36 to 19.58 mA cm−2. When the cosensitization extended for over 2.0 h, the Jsc value decreased apparently, which was caused by the sharp decrease of IPCE values in the long wavelength region. While the cosensitization lasted for 2 h, which presented the highest Jsc value, the absorbance of the Q band of XW4 was only around 20% of the original value, corresponding to a ratio between XW4 and WS-5 of 1/16 (Table 2). Accordingly, the cosensitization was actually dominated by WS-5 while only a small amount of XW4 was utilized to enhance the IPCE response in the long wavelength region.

Besides, the cosensitized photoanodes in the reverse dipping order were also studied, that is, the TiO2 electrodes were first immersed in WS-5 for 12.0 h and then immersed in XW4 for 0–2.0 h (Table 3), showing poorer performance than their corresponding devices (devices B, C, and D). For example, compared with device C, the efficiency of the device decreased to 8.35%, with a Jsc value of 16.30 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 750 mV, and a FF value of 0.67, under the same conditions.

Actually, when carefully comparing the Jsc value with different adsorption sequences, the cosensitization effect is quite different. While the electrode was sensitized by XW4 and then cosensitized by WS-5 for 0.5–2.0 h, the Jsc values remained at the same level and showed a slight increase. In contrast, while the electrode was sensitized by WS-5 then cosensitized by XW4 for 0.5–2.0 h, the Jsc values decreased obviously. A plausible explanation is that a small molecular volume of WS-5 can guarantee the adsorption of the dye on the unoccupied TiO2 surface but not the replacement of XW4. However, in the case of WS-5/XW4, XW4 with a large molecular volume is difficult to adsorb on TiO2, which was crowdedly covered by WS-5, without the replacement of WS-5, thus resulting in the decrease of overall dye-loaded amount. Accordingly, by using the WS-5/XW4 cosensitized TiO2 electrode, a very promising PCE value of 10.41% was achieved, with a Jsc value of 18.79 mA cm−2, a Voc value of 774 mV, and a FF value of 0.72. Furthermore, the PCE remained at 98% of the initial value after 1000 h of aging test, demonstrating the high stability of the cosensitized DSSC device (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Variation of photovoltaic parameters with aging time test for WS-5/XW4 cosensitized DSSCs under visible-light soaking. 
To be noticed, along with the increase of the dipping time from 0 to 4.0 h, the Voc value also increased from 714 to 803 mV. As is known, with the use of fixed redox species, the Voc value is only determined by the Fermi level (EFn) of TiO2, which is affected by the conduction band of TiO2 (ECB) and the charge recombination rate.1b Therefore, cosensitization can not only patch up the lack of light harvesting to enhance the Jsc value, but also can optimize the ECB value or the interfacial charge transfer process to enhance the Voc value. To gain insight into the effect of cosensitization on Voc, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on WS-5-, XW4-, and WS-5/XW4 sensitized DSSCs and is shown in Fig. 5. The fitted capacitive (Cμ) response of three devices is shown in Fig. 5a. The logarithm of Cμ was increased linearly with the given bias potential, and all the curves exhibited the same slope. Moreover, at fixed potential, the Cμ values of all three devices are the same, indicating that the ECB values of three devices are at the same level. That means the increase of Voc should originate from the prevention of interfacial charge recombination. Thus, the recombination resistance (RCT) values were further measured (Fig. 5b). At fixed potential, the Rrec values of three devices lie in the order of WS-5 > WS-5/XW4 > XW4, in good agreement with their similar Voc values (Tables 1 and 3). The increase of the cosensitization device in Voc should be predominantly arisen from the repression of charge recombination. Thus, the charge lifetimes (τ) of three devices were calculated according to τ = CμRCT, and are shown in Fig. 5c. At fixed potential, taking 0.70 V for example, the τ values of three devices were calculated to be 0.14, 0.01, and 0.05 s, respectively. Obviously, the introduction of the coadsorbent with the bulk chain such as WS-5 can distinctly repress the charge recombination rate, thus resulting in the efficient enhancement in Voc from 714 to 774 mV.

Finally, to facilitate feasible applications, the DSSCs based on the quasi-solid-state electrolyte were also prepared. Compared to the devices based on liquid electrolytes, only a slight decrease was found in Jsc and Voc (Fig. 6). Thus, the major factor for the sharp decrease in PCE was the obvious reduction in FF from 0.72 to 0.63, which was caused by the increase of charge transfer resistance in the quasi-solid cell device.

Conclusions
Cosensitization based on multiple dyes as “dye cocktails” has been focused, especially in compensating and broadening the light response region. Exploring organic dye WS-5 and porphyrin XW4 as the cosensitized couple, the light harvesting defect of each single dye has been sufficiently overcome. Besides, with the long alkyl chain on the additional acceptor in D–A–π–A featured organic dyes, WS-5 could also prevent the charge recombination effectively, leading to a great enhancement in Voc. As a result, a very promising overall photovoltaic efficiency of 10.41% with long-term stability was achieved (Jsc = 18.79 mA cm−2, Voc = 774 mV, and FF = 0.72). Furthermore, the PCE remains at 98% of the initial value after 1000 h of aging test, demonstrating the high stability of the cosensitized DSSC device. While utilizing the quasi-solid state electrolyte, only a slight decrease was found in Jsc and Voc. Our work well demonstrates the effective strategy of cosensitization to combine the advantages of both porphyrin and organic dyes, especially for developing highly efficient panchromatic DSSCs.
