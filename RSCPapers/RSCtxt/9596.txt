Development of efficient organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, specifically bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells, has become an active area of research in recent years due to their potential as an economically competitive sustainable energy source.1–5 Optimization of a wide range of polymer materials properties, such as band gap (Eg), frontier molecular orbital energies, or light absorption strength are usually achieved by various synthesis strategies. Alternating electron donor and acceptor (D–A) units in a polymer main chain is one of the most commonly used approaches for tuning the band gap.6–9 In addition, maintaining high absorption coefficients (α) (ca. 105 cm−1) of the polymers is equally important in generating higher photocurrent in solar cells,1 because it is typically difficult to extract charge from devices thicker than 200 nm.10 However, there is limited understanding about enhancing the absorption coefficients. In most common BHJ solar cell architectures, the active layer is made of a blend of a donor polymer along with a soluble fullerene derivative, such as [6,6]-phenyl C61butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an acceptor.1 The open circuit voltage (Voc) depends on the energy difference between the ionization potential (roughly speaking, HOMO energy) of the donor polymer and the electron affinity (LUMO energy) of the fullerene derivative. Thus, a polymer with a lower HOMO would potentially generate a higher Voc.1,11,12
Novel fused aromatic thienopyrazine-based acceptors have recently been developed and employed in donor–acceptor type conjugated polymers.13–16 The fused unit provides a planar and electron rich π-face, which promotes well ordered inter-chain packing and improves charge carrier mobility.15 A commonly used fluorene-based copolymer structure,7,15–24 such as ACT-T-FL, where a substituted thiophene is used between donor and acceptor units, was adopted to achieve a lower band gap and better polymer solubility. Though significantly higher charge carrier mobility (up to 0.2 cm2/V s) was achieved by introducing our fused aromatic thienopyrazine unit in such copolymers, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ACT-T-FL:PCBM blends in OPV devices were still limited to only 1.4%, mainly due to rather low short-circuit current density (Jsc, 5 mA/cm2) and Voc (0.6 V) values. These Jsc and Voc values were attributed to the limited absorption coefficient (α < 6 × 104 cm−1) and rather small ionization potential (∼5 eV).
A theoretical investigation using density functional theory (DFT) indicates that the electron density in the LUMO wave function is more localized on the acceptor unit of ACT-T-FL (Fig. 1a), while the electron density associated with the HOMO wave function remains delocalized over both the acceptor and donor units (Figure S1†). The localization of the LUMO decreases orbital overlap with the HOMO, which can be detrimental to the strength of the lowest S0 → S1 absorption. Interestingly, the LUMO wave function of the polymer ACT-FL (Fig. 1b), where the alkyl thiophenes are absent, is more delocalized over both the donor and acceptor units while the HOMO wave function still remains well delocalized. This should favor HOMO/LUMO overlap and enhance the absorption coefficient for the lowest optical transition (which is dominated by HOMO-to-LUMO electron excitation).
 Fig. 1  DFT-calculated LUMO of the geometry optimized structures (B3LYP/6-31G*) of analogous trimers of (a) ACT-T-FL and (b) ACT-FL. 
Based on this encouraging theoretical observation, the copolymer ACT-FL was synthesized by Suzuki polycondensation between 8,10-dibromoacenaphtho[1,2-e]thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine and 2,7-bis(trimethyleneborate)-9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)fluorene. The absorption coefficient increases by 1.5 times at the peak position in the low band gap region compared to its adjacent thiophene analogue (ACT-T-FL). This is a significant enhancement in absorption considering the much lower molecular weight25 of ACT-FL (mainly limited by the solubility) compared to ACT-T-FL. ACT-FL is thermally stable for >400 °C as indicated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), ACT-FL shows transition temperatures of 328 °C during heating and 315 °C during cooling, which were attributed to the melting point (Tm) and crystallization temperature (Tc), respectively (Figure S4†). These transition temperatures are much lower for ACT-T-FL structure (∼200 °C).15
The polymer properties were estimated from gas-phase calculations on oligomers (n = 1–3) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory using Kuhn fits of energy versus 1/N where N is the number of double bonds.26,27 The calculated band gaps are in good agreement with experimental values (Table 1). The calculated adiabatic ionization potentials (IPs) of ACT-FL and ACT-T-FL are 5.22 eV and 4.86 eV, respectively; these follow the same trend as IPs measured using photo electron spectroscopy (PES). The higher IP or deeper HOMO of ACT-FL would potentially produce higher Voc in OPV devices. This is an additional advantage of the ACT-FL structure compared to ACT-T-FL. Absorption of both polymers is ∼30–40 nm red-shifted in thin films compared to that in o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), indicating that the advantages due to planar fused unit are retained in the ACT-FL structure.

The tapping mode AFM image of ACT-FL indicates crystalline thin film structure (Figure S5†). However, in top contact thin film transistor (TFT) devices, ACT-FL shows a maximum field effect mobility (µFET) of 2.3 × 10−3 cm2/V s, and an average µFET of 1.8 × 10−3 cm2/V s, with a threshold voltage of ca. −31 V and typical ION/IOFF of 106 (Figure S6†). These mobilities are lower than those measured in ACT-T-FLpolymer TFTs, where µFET ranges from 0.07 to 0.2 cm2/V s depending on film structural factors.15,28 Hole mobility was evaluated on diode devices (device structure: glass/ITO/PEDOT-PSS/polymer/Au) and extracted using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model.29 The hole diode mobility of annealed (∼200 °C) film of ACT-FL is 1.06 × 10−5 cm2/V s (Figure S7†). Interestingly, the diode mobility of ACT-FL is higher than that of ACT-T-FL type polymers (∼2.9 × 10−6 cm2/V s)15 even though the former shows a lower FET mobility. The diode mobilities of semiconducting polymers are a few orders of magnitude lower compared to the field effect transistor mobilities, mainly due to the higher charge carrier density in OTFT devices.30 This is what we observed in our polymers. The polymer with higher transistor mobility is expected to show higher diode mobility. However, we observed the opposite trend in these two types of polymer. To rationalize this observation, it is important to recognize that transistor mobility is measured in the plane of the substrate, while the diode mobility is measured perpendicular to the substrate. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering of ACT-FL films spin-cast onto bare silicon (annealed at ∼200 °C) revealed a diffraction near the qz direction at 17.5 nm−1, corresponding to a repeat distance of 0.36 nm (Fig. 2). The presence of this feature indicates that the planar π-face of the acenaphthyl group is preferentially oriented parallel to the substrate, which acts to reduce the µFET, but to enhance the diode mobility.

        BHJ solar cells were fabricated using a glass/ITO/PEDOT-PSS/polymer-PC61BM blend/Al device structure. A PCE of 1.6% was achieved using a blend weight ratio of 1:4 ACT-FL to PC61BM. Solar cells fabricated using ACT-T-FL under identical conditions were reported earlier31 and showed a PCE of 0.7% (Fig. 3b). A significant enhancement of the Voc and almost a doubling of Jsc were observed in ACT-FLcells (Voc = 0.725 V, Jsc = 5.14 mA/cm2) compared to ACT-T-FLcells (Voc = 0.595 V, Jsc = 2.5 mA/cm2). A slightly higher Voc (0.795 V) was obtained in photovoltaic cells using a blend of 1:1 ACT-FL/PC61BM in the active layer. As highlighted earlier, the absence of the adjacent thiophene groups around the thienopyrazine unit in ACT-FL allows for increased optical absorption and deepens the HOMO energy and, as a result, enhances the PCE by improving both Voc and Jsc. Thus, these types of polymers are more attractive for OPV applications, since ACT-FL already outperforms optimized ACT-T-FL solar cells, which showed a max. PCE of 1.3%.28ACT-FL devices respond well in the visible region up to 700 nm, with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 48% at 420 nm and 38% at ∼580 nm (Figure S9†).

Our quantum-mechanical calculations underline that introduction of adjacent thiophenes around the thienopyrazine unit causes localization of the LUMO regardless of whether there is a fused unit or not. Similar behavior can be observed in D–A copolymers containing other acceptors, such as 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (Figure S2†). Due to the lack of reported absorption coefficient data of such polymers, we have compared the absorption of the vinylene linked benzothiadiazole based D–A copolymers (Chart S1†), where we have also observed a 1.6 fold enhancement of the optical absorption in the low band gap region of the polymer in the absence of adjacent thiophenes. The detailed properties of these polymers will be discussed elsewhere.
Conclusions
The optimization of polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells requires balancing a series of materials parameters. Here, we have shown that the removal of the adjacent thiophene groups around the acceptor core in low band gap polymers markedly increases the optical absorption and raises the ionization potential of the polymer. As a consequence, significant enhancement in PCE is observed in solar cell devices using the fused thienopyrazine-based polymer without adjacent thiophenes, due to increased Voc and Jsc. We believe that this approach should be considered for future design of polymers for solar cell applications. We also note that this new polymer is preferentially oriented with the π-face parallel to the substrate, another desirable property in efficient solar cell design. Further investigation is underway to better understand the structure-property relationships of these polymers and enhance the efficiency.
