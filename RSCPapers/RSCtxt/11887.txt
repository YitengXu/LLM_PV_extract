    , Accepted 14th July 2020First published on 14th July 2020AbstractTraditional techniques for the synthesis of nickel sulfide (NiS) nanoparticles (NPs) always present drawbacks of morphological irregularity, non-porous structure and poor long-term stability, which are extremely unfavorable for establishing effective therapeutic agents. Here, a category of hollow mesoporous NiS (hm-NiS) NPs with uniform spherical structure and good aqueous dispersity were innovatively developed based on a modified solvothermal reaction technique. Upon the successful synthesis of hm-NiS NPs, dopamine was seeded and in situ polymerized into polydopamine (PDA) on the NP surface, followed by functionalization with thiol-polyethylene glycol (SH-PEG) and encapsulation of the chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin (DOX), to form hm-NiS@PDA/PEG/DOX (NiPPD) NPs. The resultant NiPPD NPs exhibited a decent photothermal response and stability, attributed to the optical absorption of the hm-NiS nanocore and PDA layer in the near-infrared (NIR) region. Furthermore, stimulus-responsive drug release was achieved under both acidic pH conditions and NIR laser irradiation, owing to the protonation of –NH2 groups in the DOX molecules and local thermal shock, respectively. Lastly, a strong combinatorial photothermal–chemotherapeutic effect was demonstrated for tumor suppression with minimal systemic toxicity in vivo. Collectively, this state-of-the-art paradigm may provide useful insights to deepen the application of hm-NiS NPs for disease management and precision medicine.
Introduction
Non-invasive therapeutic modalities have sparked rapidly growing interest for effective tumor elimination, owing to their lesion-specific administration, spatiotemporal controllability and minimized side effects toward normal tissues.1–3 For example, photothermal therapy (PTT), which ablates solid tumors through light-activated local hyperthermia mediated by PTT agents, has aroused increasing attention in non-invasive oncotherapy, owing to its high treatment efficacy and limited adverse side effects toward healthy tissue.4–6 To become a potent PTT agent candidate, they should possess good biocompatibility, uniform size distribution and high photothermal conversion efficiency in the near-infrared (NIR) region.7,8 Therefore, novel PTT agents are being constantly developed to provide more options for clinical applications. Moreover, scalable synthesis at a low cost is highly recommended for industrial production.9 However, owing to the unavoidable light scattering and tissue absorption, it becomes extremely challenging to eliminate solid tumors by PTT alone, particularly deep-seated tumors and the margins of tumor tissues.10,11 In another aspect, traditional chemotherapy suffers from undesirable systemic side effects and drug resistance, which tremendously reduce patient compliance and lead to unsatisfactory treatment efficacy. Inspired by the fact that drug release and cellular uptake can be accelerated by hyperthermia, the incorporation of PTT and chemotherapy can render an outstanding treatment outcome through either additive or synergistic effects, without causing severe adverse effects.12–14 At the current stage, a good number of PTT agents, including inorganic nanomaterials (gold-,15,16 carbon-,17 transition-metal chalcogenide-18–20 and MoS2-based nanostructures21,22) and organic nanocomposites (polypyrrole,22,23 polyaniline24 and porphysomes25), have been synthesized for tumor ablation through photo-induced hyperthermia. However, up to now, functional nanostructures serving as both PTT agents and drug carriers are still limited for bimodal photothermal–chemotherapy.
As earth-abundant and eco-friendly substances, nickel chalcogenides have been extensively applied in the fields of supercapacitors, solar cells, catalysis and biosensors.26–28 Thus far, many techniques, including mechanochemical preparation,29 hydro/solvothermal methods,30,31 spray pyrolysis,32 precursor decomposition,33 microwave radiation,34etc., were proposed for synthesizing versatile nickel sulfide (NiS) nanoparticles (NPs). However, new synthetic strategies are still urgently demanded for developing NiS NPs with high regularity and uniformity. As mentioned above, PTT agents can absorb light energy, which further causes electron excitation and subsequent non-radiative relaxation. This kinetic energy in turn results in heat generation surrounding the PTT agents.11 Recently, nickel chalcogenides with strong optical absorption in both NIR-I and NIR-II regions, as well as high photothermal conversion efficiency, have been used as a category of promising PTT agents activated by photo-irradiation, which exhibited a brand-new aspect of using these nanoagents in the research area of biomedicine.13,35 Nevertheless, these solid NPs were not favorable for highly efficient drug loading, and thereby the synthesis of mesoporous hollow ones are eagerly anticipated for realizing combinatorial therapeutic effects. On the other hand, dopamine (DA), as a natural neurotransmitter, can be self-polymerized into polydopamine (PDA) under mild-alkaline conditions, which is extensively used for enhancing the biocompatibility of nanocarriers through in situ layer growth.36,37
In this study, we innovatively proposed a modified solvothermal-based approach to synthesize hollow mesoporous (hm) NiS NPs with high aqueous stability and monodispersity. Afterwards, surface modification was conducted by in situ polymerization of DA under the condition of alkalinity, followed by functionalization by thiol-polyethylene glycol (SH-PEG) and subsequent encapsulation of the chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin (DOX). The as-synthesized hm-NiS@PDA/PEG/DOX (NiPPD) NPs showed admirable heat generation capacity and photothermal stability. Moreover, the release of the encapsulated drug can be accelerated by not only local hyperthermia but also acidic pH conditions mimicking the tumor microenvironment (TME). The combinatorial photothermal–chemotherapeutic effect induced by NiPPD NPs upon NIR laser irradiation was verified both in cellular studies and on mouse models. Taken together, such hm-NiS NPs exhibited great potential to serve as the multifunctional therapeutic agents for biomedical applications (Fig. 1).

MPEG2000-SH was obtained from Shanghai Ponsure Biotech, Inc. (China). Doxorubicin (DOX) was supplied by Beijing Hvsf United Chemical Materials Co. Ltd (China). Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, >97.0%), thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT, 98%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were obtained from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd (China). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), TrypLETM Express enzyme, Alexa Fluor 633 dye and LIVE/DEAD™ viability/cytotoxicity kit were acquired from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (USA). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining kit, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) apoptosis assay kit and Ki67 cell proliferation kit were purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology (China). Kunming (KM) mice and BALB/c mouse models were purchased from Chongqing Tengxin Experimental Animals Co. Ltd (China). All the reagents were used as received, without additional purification.
Preparation of hm-NiS NPs
First, 1.6 mg of nickel acetate tetrahydrate and 2.95 mg of thioacetamide were dissolved in 25 mL of absolute ethyl alcohol under magnetic stirring. A clear solution with green color was obtained after constant stirring for 30 min. Afterwards, the solution was moved into a Teflon vessel (50 mL), followed by sealing and heating at 150 °C for 1.5 h. Next, a dark precipitate was collected after centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min, and subsequently washed with ethanol thrice and deionized (DI) water twice. Lastly, the product was placed in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h, and was then ready for use.
Preparation of NiPPD NPs
Briefly, hm-NiS NPs (12 mg) was dispersed in Tris buffer solution (12 mL, pH = 8.5), and 200 μL of dopamine solution was dropwise added into the above dispersion (100 μg mL−1). Then, the mixture underwent vigorous magnetic stirring for 6 h to allow the formation of a PDA coating. The as-synthesized hm-NiS@PDA NPs were collected after centrifugation at 7500 rpm for 10 min, and rinsed with DI water thrice. To conjugate PEG, hm-NiS@PDA NPs (4 mg) and MPEG2000-SH (80 mg) were mixed in 2 mL of Tris buffer solution (pH = 8.5). After stirring for 12 h, hm-NiS@PDA/PEG (NiPP) NPs were centrifugally harvested and purified with DI water. Thereafter, 4 mg DOX was introduced into a NiPP aqueous dispersion (12 mL, 0.7 mg mL−1), and the reaction was carried out under stirring for 12 h at room temperature in a light-resistant container. The precipitate was centrifugally collected, and further rinsed with DI water to remove loosely bound drug molecules. Finally, the as-synthesized NiPPD NPs were stored at 4 °C prior to use.
Characterizations
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-7800F, JEOL, Japan) were used to characterize the sample morphology. UV-vis-NIR absorbance spectra were acquired using a spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan). Average hydrodynamic size and surface charge were measured using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, UK). The crystalline form was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using a Shimadzu (XRD-7000, Japan) diffractometer. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume distribution were calculated based on the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm using a Quantachrome Nova 1200e analyzer.
Drug loading efficiency and in vitro drug release
To quantify the drug loading content (LC) and encapsulation efficiency (EE), the supernatant after centrifugations was harvested during DOX encapsulation. LC and EE of DOX were determined in accordance with the calibration curve at 480 nm via spectrophotometry. And, specific calculation formulas (1) and (2) are listed as follows: (1) (2)
To understand the drug release behavior, an NiPPD NP aqueous dispersion (2 mL, 2 mg mL−1) in a dialysis bag (MWCO = 3500) was submerged in 78 mL of PBS with different pH values (7.4, 6.8 or 5.0). The system was placed in a light-resistant place with a fixed temperature of 37 °C or 42 °C. To record the drug release profile, a sample of releasing medium (3 mL) was taken at predefined time points, and then fresh medium of equal volume was replenished for consistency. To explore photo-induced drug release, the sample-laden dialysis bag was irradiated by a NIR laser (808 nm, 1.5 W cm−2) for periodic cycles (laser on: 5 min). Upon the collection of releasing medium samples before and after laser irradiation, the amount of released drug was similarly determined based on the above-mentioned spectrophotometry.
Photothermal properties of NiPPD NPs
3 mL samples of NiPPD aqueous dispersion at gradient concentrations (100 to 500 μg mL−1) in quartz vials were exposed to a NIR laser (808 nm, 1.5 W cm−2) for 10 min, and a thermal imager (TiS55, Fluke, USA) was used to dynamically take thermographic photos. Photothermal stability of NiPPD was analyzed through periodical NIR irradiation toward an NiPPD aqueous dispersion (300 μg mL−1) for five cycles. Temperature variation was recorded in real-time during laser irradiation and spontaneous system cooling processes. The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) was calculated based on eqn (3).38,39 (3)where h is the heat transfer coefficient, S is the surface area of the container, Tmax is the steady temperature of the sample upon reaching a maximum, Tsurr is the ambient temperature, Q0 is the energy contribution from water, I is the laser power, and A808 is the absorbance of sample at 808 nm. The value hS can be calculated from eqn (4). (4)where m (3.0 g) and c (4.2 J g−1) are the mass and heat capacity of DI water, respectively. τs is the system constant that can be derived from the pattern of cooling curve and calculated from eqn (5). (5)
Based on the equations of (3)–(5), the η value of NiPPD NPs can be determined.
Biocompatibility assessment
Cytotoxicity of NiPP NPs toward normal somatic cells was evaluated by using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and murine L929 fibrosarcoma cells (L929s). Briefly, cells (1 × 104 per well) in a 96-well plate were cultured overnight, followed by treatment with NiPP NPs (25–500 μg mL−1) for 24 h. Afterwards, MTT solution (200 μL, 250 μg mL−1) was introduced into each well to replace the old medium. Subsequent to the reaction for 4 h, the supernatant was discarded, followed by the addition of 150 μL of DMSO. After shaking for 15 min, optical absorption intensities at 490 nm and 630 nm were measured using a microplate reader (SPARK 10M, TECAN). Cell viability was quantified based on the eqn (6): (6)
To carry out the hemolytic test, fresh whole blood was harvested from the retro-orbital plexus of KM mice. Next, erythrocytes were centrifugally isolated from the whole blood. After rinsing with PBS four times, the erythrocytes were dispersed in PBS at a final concentration of 4 wt%. Subsequently, 0.5 mL of erythrocyte solution was mixed with NiPPD dispersion (100, 300, 500 and 700 μg mL−1) in PBS, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 6 h. Finally, all the specimens were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min, and optical absorption of the supernatant was measured at 570 nm based on spectrophotometry.
To conduct routine blood tests, female KM mice (6 weeks, ∼25 g each) were divided into 2 groups at random, followed by intravenous injection of 100 μL saline or NiPPD dispersion (100 μL, 500 μg mL−1). The blood samples were harvested from the orbital venous plexus at days 1, 3, 7 and 14 post-injection, and major blood indicators were measured using an automatic blood cell analyzer (BC-2600Vet, Mindary, China).
Cellular uptake and internalization
Briefly, 4T1 cells in a 24-well plate (seeding density: 7.5 × 104 per well) were incubated overnight, and subsequently exposed to the NiPPD NPs (500 μL, 200 μg mL−1). After incubation for 0.5, 1 and 2 h, the cells were rinsed with PBS thrice and fixed by formalin for 30 min. After permeabilizing with Triton X-100 (0.1% in PBS, v/v) for 5 min and blockage with BSA (0.1% in PBS, w/v) for 30 min, the cells were stained by Alexa Fluor 633 phalloidin (20 nM) for 1 h and DAPI (2 μg mL−1) for 10 min. The intracellular fluorescence emission was observed from three channels of DAPI (λex = 405 nm, λem = 410–481 nm), AF633 (λex = 633 nm, λem = 638–747 nm) and DOX (λex = 525 nm, λem = 535–630 nm) by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM, LSM800, Zeiss). To real-time monitor intracellular drug release behavior, NiPPD-treated cells were alternatively stained by Lysotracker Red (10 μg mL−1) for 45 min and Hoest 33342 (2 μg mL−1) for 5 min. The fluorescence signal was similarly detected by LSCM.

In vitro cytotoxicity study
Briefly, 4T1 cells in a 12-well plate (1 × 105 per well) were incubated overnight, followed by administration with NiPPD NPs for 4 h. Afterwards, NIR laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.5 W cm−2) was conducted for 5 min if applicable. Next, the cells were gently washed with PBS and stained by the LIVE/DEAD™ viability/cytotoxicity kit. The stained cells were imaged by fluorescence microscopy (IX73, Olympus, Japan). To quantify the cytotoxicity of NiPPD NPs toward cancer cells in vitro, 4T1 cells in a 96-well plate (104 per well) were cultured overnight, and exposed to NiPP or NiPPD NPs at different concentrations for 12 h. Then, the cells were irradiated using an NIR laser (808 nm, 1.5 W cm−2) for 5 min where applicable, and incubated for another 12 h. Finally, the cell viability was quantified based on the standard MTT cell viability assay.
Therapeutic efficacy in vivo
All the animal experiments were conducted under the supervision of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Southwest University and complied with the National Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of China. To establish an implanted tumor model, 100 μL of 4T1 cell suspension (1 × 106 in saline) was subcutaneously inoculated into the side dorsal region of female BALB/c mice (6 weeks, ∼20 g), and the tumor volume was dynamically monitored according to formula (7): V = L × W2 × 0.5(7)where L and W represent the longest and shortest dimensions of the tumor, respectively.
Once the tumor reached a volume of 150 mm3, all the mice were allocated into six groups (n = 5 per group), and subjected to the treatments of (1) saline, (2) NIR laser, (3) DOX, (4) NiPP + laser, (5) NiPPD and (6) NiPPD + laser. The drug dosage of each group was set as an equivalent DOX concentration of 2 mg kg−1. NIR laser irradiation was applied for 5 min at 24 h post-injection in groups (2), (4) and (6). Afterwards, the mice were monitored for tumor volume and body weight for two weeks. On day 14, all the animals were sacrificed to collect the solid tumor and major organs, followed by histopathological examination via H&E, TUNEL or Ki67 staining. All the slices were analyzed using an IX73 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan).
Statistical analysis
Data are shown as mean ± SD in accordance with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using OriginPro 9.0 (OriginLab, MA, USA). A p-value less than 0.05 (*p < 0.05, n = 4) was considered to be statistically significant.
Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization of hm-NiS and NiPPD NPs
TEM and SEM images explicitly illustrated the hollow mesoporous spherical structure of the as-synthesized hm-NiS NPs with good dispersion and uniform size distribution (Fig. 2a–d). The average diameter and nanoshell thickness of hm-NiS NPs were determined to be ∼212 nm and ∼38.2 nm, respectively. The energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) pattern further demonstrated the successful synthesis of hm-NiS NPs without any impurities (Fig. 2e and Fig. S1, ESI†). The hybrid crystalline structure of hm-NiS NPs was further characterized by XRD, which was in line with three distinct NiS phases, including Ni3S4 (JCPDS 76-1813), millerite NiS (JCPDS 12-0041) and β-phase NiS (JCPDS 75-0613) (Fig. 2f).40 The high-resolution (HR) TEM image indicated the spacing of a typical lattice to be 0.275 nm, which corresponded well with the interplanar spacing of millerite NiS at (3 0 0) and β-phase NiS at (1 0 0) (Fig. S2, ESI†). The hydrodynamic size and polydispersity index (PDI) of hm-NiS NPs were calculated to be 289.7 nm and 0.363, respectively (Fig. S3a, ESI†). In addition, the specific surface area and average pore size of hm-NiS NPs were measured to be 669.41 m2 g−1 and 1.93 nm, respectively (Fig. 2g and h). The highly porous structure and hollow cavity may enable hm-NiS NPs to be promising nanocarriers for high-dose drug loading. The underlying mechanism of exploiting the solvothermal-based technique to synthesize hm-NiS NPs can be hypothesized as following. Initially, solid NiS NPs were assembled by tiny NiS particles under extremely high supersaturation in a short reaction time. Afterwards, the outmost layer of solid NiS NPs was slowly integrated by the slightly larger NiS particles under considerably lower supersaturation. Since particles with smaller size usually have a higher solubility, the interior particles would be gradually dissolved during the process of crystal structural evolution. The solutes may progressively recrystallize on the outmost layer of larger NiS particles, eventually resulting in the formation of β-phase NiS with a small amount of Ni3S4.41

To synthesize NiPPD NPs, a PDA coating was first generated through alkaline-activated polymerization of DA seeds on the hm-NiS NP surface. To construct NiPP NPs, conjugation of the SH-PEG molecules was realized through the Michael addition between the catechol groups of PDA and reactive thiols.42,43 Finally, DOX was loaded onto NiPP NPs via both hydrophobic interaction and π–π stacking between the sp2-bonded carbon skeleton and aromatic structure of DOX.44 As shown in Fig. 3a and b, well-dispersed NiPPD NPs exhibited a spherical structure with a mean diameter of ∼218 nm. In addition, the hydrodynamic size and polydispersity index (PDI) of NiPPD NPs were calculated to be 247 nm and 0.196, respectively (Fig. S3b, ESI†). Compared to hm-NiS NPs, the hydrodynamic size decrease of NiPPD NPs can be explained by the improved colloidal stability arising from the PEG conjugation. Long-term stability of NiPPD NPs under physiological conditions was assessed by monitoring the hydrodynamic diameter in in PBS, DMEM and FBS (10%) for seven days. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), there was no significant fluctuation in the hydrated size during this period, indicating an admirable stability of NiPPD NPs when circulating in the bloodstream. Furthermore, the zeta potential of all the intermediate and final products, including hm-NiS, hm-NiS@PDA, NiPP and NiPPD NPs, were measured to better understand the synthetic procedure (Fig. S5, ESI†). In comparison to −13.9 eV for pristine NiS NPs, in situ growth of PDA resulted in a slight decrease of surface potential to −19.4 eV, ascribed to the integrative effects of the catechol, quinone, amino, planar indole units and carboxylic acid groups in the PDA chemical structures. The zeta potential of NiPP NPs was measured to be −14.1 eV, suggesting an effective conjugation of PEG through the Michael addition reaction. Distinctly, NiPPD NPs displayed a surface potential of −2.95 eV, manifesting a successful DOX loading into the nanocarrier. The UV-vis-NIR spectrum of NiPPD NPs displayed a characteristic absorption peak at ∼490 nm, strongly evidencing the effective loading of DOX (Fig. 3c). A significant absorption decrease of the characteristic peak at ∼490 nm was observed after DOX encapsulation. We speculated two underlying mechanisms that may help explain this optical property change in DOX. First, conformational change of DOX may potentially occur in coordination to NiPP nanocarriers upon drug loading.45 In addition, the strong shielding effect of SH-PEG could also contribute to the decline of DOX optical absorption.46 Based on spectrophotometry, LC and EE of DOX were quantified to be as much as 7.1% and 66.9%, respectively. The highly efficient drug encapsulation can benefit from not only the hollow mesoporous structure of hm-NiS but also the powerful interaction between PDA and DOX. In addition, fluorescence spectra of both DOX and NiPPD NPs displayed the same characteristic emission peak at ∼565 nm, further verifying an effective encapsulation of the chemotherapeutic drug (Fig. S6, ESI†).

Photothermal properties of NiPPD NPs
Owing to strong optical absorption in the NIR region, the photothermal properties of NiPPD NPs was evaluated by irradiating sample-laden cuvettes using an NIR laser (808 nm, 1.5 W cm−2) for various time periods. Temperature elevation of NiPPD NPs (3 mL, 200 μg mL−1) increased by 17.2 °C after 10 min irradiation, in sharp contrast to 0.7 °C of DI water, suggesting a good potential for hyperthermia-induced tumor destruction (Fig. 3d and e). In addition, the light-activated temperature increase was also found to be positively correlated to NiPPD concentration ranging from 100 to 500 μg mL−1 (Fig. 3f). To evaluate the photostability for PTT, four consecutive NIR irradiation cycles were conducted in an on/off manner (laser on for 10 min per cycle). No significant decrease of peak temperature was observed among all irradiation cycles, manifesting an excellent photothermal stability of the as-synthesized NiPPD NPs (Fig. 3g). The photothermal conversion efficiency (η) of NiPPD NPs was quantified to be 18.5%, as derived from Fig. 3h and i. These results indicated that NiPPD NPs can be utilized as a promising PTT agent for tumor therapy.

In vitro drug release
To investigate the stimulus-responsive drug release, the drug release profile was first monitored under different pH conditions and temperatures. After 24 h incubation, cumulative DOX release at 37 °C reached up to 58.4% and 47.0% under pH 5.0 and 6.8, respectively, which was dramatically higher than 33.6% obtained under neutral conditions (Fig. 4a). The acidity-promoted drug release can be explained by the protonation of the amino group in DOX, which diminished the drug binding affinity and enhanced the drug hydrophilicity.47 Moreover, the drug release particularly at pH = 5.0 and 6.8 can be further accelerated under mild hyperthermia at 42 °C (Fig. 4b), provided by the mild acidic TME. NiPPD NPs are therefore supposed to be favourable for tumor-targeted drug delivery. In addition, the thermal shock-activated drug release was evaluated through NIR irradiation in a pulse mode (laser on for 5 min for each pulse). As anticipated, the drug release was remarkably accelerated during a laser irradiation course under all the three pH conditions. It can be speculated that the local hyperthermia produced by NIR irradiation can disrupt the binding force between the drug and nanocarrier, which promoted the drug diffusion into the releasing medium.48,49 All these findings suggested that NiPPD NPs exhibited promising prospects for on-demand drug release through the switching of NIR light.

Cellular uptake and in vitro cytotoxicity
Effective intracellular internalization of NPs is a prerequisite for the realization of their therapeutic functions. In this regard, cellular uptake of NiPPD NPs was explored by tracking the fluorescence signal of DOX in 4T1 cells (Fig. 5a). The fluorescence intensity increased with the incubation time from 0.5 h to 2 h, suggesting a time-dependent cellular uptake. DOX signal was mainly detected in the nucleus region, which can be attributed to the irreversible intercalation of DOX with DNA. On the other hand, the presence of DOX fluorescence was in a trace amount in the cytoplasm, which can be ascribed to the washing away of internalized NPs during the elution of staining dye. Simultaneously, lysosomal co-localization was visualized after cell staining with LysoTracker Red and Hoest 33342 (Fig. 5b). At 0.5 h, an almost complete fluorescence overlap of LysoTracker and DOX was found in the cytoplasm, suggesting a typical lysosome-associated endocytosis pathway. However, the amount of lysosomal DOX progressively decreased over time concomitantly with nucleus accumulation during the following 1.5 h. We deduced that the high acidity of lysosomes may accelerate DOX release from the nanocarrier, and the shift of DOX enrichment can be interpreted as the unidirectional drug diffusion from lysosome to nucleus.50

NIR laser irradiation (808 nm, 1.5 W cm−2) was conducted for 5 min where applicable. 
Before evaluating the cytotoxicity of NiPPD NPs toward tumor cells, biocompatibility of NiPP NPs as a drug carrier was firstly explored on somatic cells of HUVECs and L929s by using the standard MTT assay (Fig. 5c). Cell viability was still more than 80% after the treatment of NiPP NPs with an extremely high concentration of 400 μg mL−1 for 24 h, implying a decent biocompatibility for clinical utilization. Afterwards, NiPPD-mediated tumor destruction was investigated on HeLa cells subject to diversified treatments via MTT assay (Fig. 5d). The treatments of both “NiPP + L” and “NiPPD” led to a notable cell killing effect, as evidenced by an obvious decrease in cell survival rates, particularly at the equivalent NiPPD concentration over 100 μg mL−1. The resultant cytotoxicity can be attributed to either “NiPP + L”-mediated photothermal therapy or “NiPPD”-mediated chemotherapy. In a marked contrast, the most significant cell viability reduction was observed in the cells receiving the treatment of “NiPPD + L”, benefiting from the combinatorial photothermal–chemotherapeutic outcome. Such cytotoxicity displayed an obvious dose-dependent manner, and the minimum cell viability of 6.2% was obtained at the NiPPD concentration of 500 μg mL−1. Simultaneously, such PTT/chemotherapy combined effect was further validated by using the LIVE/DEAD cell staining kit (Fig. 5e). Vivid red fluorescence was detected within the laser illumination area after cells were treated with “NiPPD + L”, manifesting a deleterious tumor cell destruction in contrast to that of the blank control group. Taken together, all these findings demonstrated a good potency of NiPPD NPs for achieving an admirable combinatorial tumor therapeutic effect.
Antitumor effect in vivo
At 24 h post-injection of various samples, the tumor site was irradiated by an NIR laser for different periods, and infrared thermography was carried out to monitor the local temperature elevation (Fig. 6a). In sharp contrast to the saline group, a rapid temperature elevation was found in both NiPP and NiPPD groups during 10 min NIR irradiation, and local temperature increment reached up to 18.1 °C and 18.7 °C, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†). The results verified an admirable hyperthermia generation effect through photo-activation. To validate the solid tumor suppression effect induced by NiPPD NPs, BALB/c mice bearing 4T1 tumors were randomly allocated into six groups and subject to various treatment regimens (Fig. 6b). Afterwards, tumor growth in each group was dynamically monitored through regularly measuring tumor volume for two weeks post-administration (Fig. 6c and d). Obviously, laser irradiation alone exhibited negligible effect on tumor growth. In comparison, a certain level of tumor inhibition was displayed in the groups of “NiPP + laser” and “NiPPD” with tumor growth inhibition (TGI) indexes of 51.5% and 55.6%, ascribed to the respective effect of PTT and chemotherapy. Notably, almost complete tumor eradication was found in the group of “NiPPD + laser”, with a TGI index of 91.8% on day 14 post-treatment. Moreover, the weights of the solid tumors excised on day 14 exhibited a similar trend of tumor volume (Fig. 6e). These discoveries testified to a premium inhibitory effect of tumors mediated by NiPPD NPs, benefiting from a strong combined treatment outcome of PTT/chemotherapy. In another aspect, the fluctuation of animal weight was not significant for all groups, suggesting minimal side effects induced by all treatment formulation (Fig. 6f). Thereafter, H&E staining, TUNEL immunofluorescence assay and Ki67 staining were further conducted to reveal the histological change in tumor tissue after different treatments (Fig. 6g). In good agreement with the findings in tumor inhibition, a severe nuclear condensation and membrane fragmentation was found in the group of “NiPPD + laser”, in comparison to regular cell morphology in the saline group. In the meantime, the most remarkable cell apoptosis and the minimum number of proliferating cells were found in group 6, as indicated by the most pervasive green fluorescence from TUNEL assay and the lowest quantity of Ki67 positive cells (brown-colored nuclei), respectively. Finally, histological sections from the major organs excised on day 14 were processed by H&E staining. There was no apparent morphological abnormalities observed at the tissue level in all experiment groups, suggesting a negligible systemic toxicity triggered during treatments (Fig. S8, ESI†).

Group 1 (saline), group 2 (NIR laser), group 3 (DOX), group 4 (NiPP + laser), group 5 (NiPPD) and group 6 (NiPPD + laser). 
To further explore the biosafety of such NiPPD NPs, a haemolytic assay was firstly conducted by incubating erythrocytes with different agents (Fig. S9, ESI†). The haemolytic rate was less than 5% after the treatment of NiPPD NPs even at a considerably high concentration of 700 μg mL−1 for 6 h, indicating a fantastic hemocompatibility for potential long-term circulation. Furthermore, blood routine examination was performed for two weeks after KM mice were intravenously injected with NiPPD NPs (Fig. S10, ESI†). All key indicators were located in the reference range of healthy mice, implying a weak influence on blood constitution. The biodegradable properties of hm-NiS NPs are crucial to circumvent long-term systemic toxicity, which facilitates their further clinical translation. One previous study has demonstrated that oxidation-induced degradation of NiS NPs occurred in the presence of dissolved oxygen and H2O2 (mimicking tumor microenvironment), as evidenced by a progressive decrease in the hydrodynamic size and fading of solution color measured by spectrophotometry.41 These findings explicitly validated NiPPD NPs as a category of desirable therapeutic agents with high biosafety.
Conclusion
In summary, novel hm-NiS NPs were successfully developed through a modified solvothermal-based strategy for realizing targeted chemotherapy and combinatorial PTT with high efficiency. The as-synthesized hm-NiS NPs exhibited a large internal cavity and strikingly porous structure, which is favourable for high dose drug loading. Moreover, such a nanostructure showed promising adsorption in the NIR region, which endowed it with great potency to serve as a new category of photothermal agents for tumor ablation. After surface modification with PEG and encapsulation of DOX mediated by PDA, the as-established NiPPD NPs displayed an acidity and hyperthermia promoted drug release behaviour. The combined photothermal–chemotherapeutic effect for tumor cell destruction was demonstrated both in cellular studies and on mouse models. Moreover, the proposed treatment regimen exhibited minimal side effects through examination using animal models. Collectively, this study not only promised the good potential of using hm-NiS NPs for combination tumor therapy but also extended further development of more related nanocomposites for biomedical applications.
