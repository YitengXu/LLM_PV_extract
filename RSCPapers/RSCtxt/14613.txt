    , Accepted 17th May 2023First published on 18th May 2023AbstractExploring high-power self-charging technologies is essential given the quick development of wearable and implantable devices. Devices that convert body heat into electricity and are based on flexible materials are known as thermoelectric conversion devices. Pentagonal-shaped layered materials have strong electrical structures and mechanical properties and can be used in microelectronic devices. Here, we have reproduced the electrical and thermoelectric transport characteristics of the PtPX (X = S, Se, Te) monolayer based on density functional theory and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. At 300 K, the mobility of the carriers in n-type doped PtPS, PtPSe, and PtPTe was very high along the y direction, measuring 1386 cm2 V−1 s−1, 312 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 14591 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Asymmetric chemical bonds in PtPSe have a high anharmonic impact that prevents heat transfer and leads to low thermal conductivity when compared to PtPS and PtPTe monolayers. We conclude that the highest ZT values of PtPS, PtPSe, and PtPTe at 800 K might be as high as 1.03, 1.26, and 2.47 for p-type doping and 1.23, 1.25, and 5.94 for n-type doping, respectively. It is expected that our findings will provide a direction toward experimental research on the thermoelectric properties of layered metal-based phosphochalcogenides.
1. Introduction
After mobile internet enters the 6G era, the Internet of Things (IoT) will be more important. The IoT is significant because it connects people, data, and devices, and improves quality of life. Wearable smart devices will undoubtedly become the mainstay of the new business model. However, the lack of a self-powered, transportable, extremely reliable flexible power supply severely restricts its development. Thermoelectric devices can achieve the conversion of heat and electricity based on the Seebeck effect and Peltier effect. The current energy conversion and practical applications have given thermoelectric materials and devices a great deal of attention.1–5 For instance, experimental preparation of and use of Bi2Te3 thin-films with high thermoelectric performance and superior flexibility has been successful.6 Thermoelectric coolers play a significant part in the area of high-performance thermal management of electrical products as a result of the semiconductor industry's quick development.7 Additionally, thermoelectric devices have demonstrated significant application in the medical field, including implantable medical devices, cryotherapy treatment, and health monitoring.8 Therefore, it is critical to develop materials with superior thermoelectric properties as well as mechanical flexibility.
Layered materials in two-dimensions have exceptional mechanical and electrical qualities. The unique physics and possible uses of materials like graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes), etc. have spurred a great deal of interest in two-dimensional (2D) materials. For instance, due to the Dirac cone, graphene exhibits excellent carrier mobility and is very appealing for use in electrical device applications.9 Transition metal dichalcogenides have potential as candidates for the next generation of electronic devices because of their high mechanical strength (able to withstand strains of up to 10%), tunable unusual electronic structure (e.g., valley Hall effect, spin Hall effect, superconductivity, giant magnetoresistance, valley polarization), and transport properties (thermoelectric performance).10–17 MXenes can be employed in a wide range of applications, from energy storage to energy conversion, including Li-ion batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors, thermoelectric conversion, and electronic devices, according to experimental and theoretical studies.18–20 This suggests that to address the demand for further applications, it is necessary to investigate novel 2D materials.
The most popular research topics among typical two-dimensional materials are layered materials with hexagonal structures like MoS2, WS2, and ReS2. Even though 2D materials have a wide range of applications, it is still difficult to achieve stable high-symmetry hexagonal structures in real-world gadgets. Two-dimensional noble-metal chalcogenide materials with low-symmetry pentagonal structures have drawn increasing amounts of attention since the successful production of a 2D material, namely PdSe2, with a new puckered pentagonal structure.21,22 According to experimental results, PdSe2 nano-thin film field-effect transistors have exceptional ambipolar transport performance.23 Additionally, theoretical and experimental work showed that PtSe2 has better air stability and mobility at high room temperatures.24 Due to the unique surface arrangement, high carrier mobility, and big on/off ratio present in these materials,25–27 studying and creating new 2D materials with low-symmetry puckered structures has therefore gained a lot of attention. Numerous experimental and theoretical efforts have recently been applied to a variety of 2D materials with puckered structures, including penta-graphene,28 penta-silicene,29BP5,30As2C,31 B2C,32 SnS233 and PdSe2.21 The remarkable features of penta-graphene and hydrogenated penta-silicene, including ultrahigh ideal strength and a modest band gap, have recently come to light in theoretical research, opening up a wide range of potential applications in future nanodevices.28,29 Penta-borides like BP5 and B2C have strong strain effects on their electrical structure.30,32 A pentagonal semiconductor As2C with an indirect band gap may be a promising contender for the next generation of optoelectronic devices due to its unique optical and electrical performance.31 SnS2, a quantum spin Hall insulator made solely of pentagonal rings, was reported to be able to produce large nontrivial gaps at ambient temperature for the first time.33 This makes it more important to research puckered 2D materials with exceptional physical properties in order to grow the family of 2D functional materials.
The bulk phase of penta-PdPX (X = S, Se) has seen substantial research in recent years. There hasn't been much study done on 2D shapes.34–37 Previous studies have demonstrated that the semiconducting 2.12 (2.95) eV band gap PdPS(Se) monolayer may be separated from its bulk counterpart with lower cleavage energies.38 Recently, layered penta-PdPSe with an orthorhombic structure—a novel 2D pentagonal material—was experimentally created.39 The authors concluded that PdPSe exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity and high photo-response properties. PdPX (X = O, S, Se, Te) nanosheets demonstrate good electrical characteristics and moderate thermal transport performance, making PdPX an exceptional candidate material for photocatalytic and thermoelectric transport materials, according to theoretical calculations as well.40,41
Experimental and theoretical research on the electronic structure, mechanical and optical properties of PdPX (X = S, Se, Te) with a puckered pentagonal structure has been carried out.42 However, little research has been done on the physical characteristics of other phosphochalcogenides based on noble metals. It is crucial to understand whether a unique 2D material can be utilized to create thermoelectric or electrical transport devices, both of which are crucial in the field of energy conversion. The goal of this work is to conduct a thorough investigation of the electronic structure, heat transport, and thermoelectric transport properties of the penta-PtPX (X = S, Se, Te) system using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), using platinum (Pt) as an example.
2. Computational details
The electronic structure was estimated using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional43 with the DFT-based Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code.44 The Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional was used to achieve an electronic energy gap measurement that was more accurate.45,46 During calculations on electronic structure and structural relaxation, the 600 eV plane wave cutoff energy was selected. Additionally, the energy of each atom was converged to below 10−4 eV, and the convergence requirements of force were set to be 10−4 eV. A 20 Å vacuum layer was chosen to prevent contact between the surrounding layers.
By using the Phonopy program and the finite displacement method, the harmonic phonon dispersion and the dynamic stability was assessed.47 The displacement was generated in a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell for all investigated materials. We also conducted computations using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) to examine the monolayer penta-PtPX (X = S, Se, Te)'s thermodynamic stability. To minimize the periodic effect, a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell size containing 192 atoms for all studied materials was adopted in the AIMD simulations using NVT ensemble at 300 K. The time step chosen was 1 fs, and a total simulation time of 10 ps. To determine the electronic transport coefficients, we used the Boltzmann transport theory as implemented in the BoltzTrap algorithm inside the constant scattering time approximation (CSTA).48
The thermal transport properties of these three materials were analyzed by solving the phonon transport equation using ShengBTE code49 by incorporation the second-order harmonic interatomic force constants (2nd IFCs) and third-order anharmonic IFCs (3rd IFCs). The 2nd IFCs were obtained from the harmonic dynamical matrix, and the 3rd IFCs were obtained by the Thirdorder.py script.50 A 4 × 4 × 1 supercell with atom interaction cutoff of reaching up to the eighth nearest neighbors was used. A 20 × 20 × 1 q-grid was used for the more precise lattice thermal conductivity after the convergence test.
Simulations based on density functional theory typically provide realistic assessments of thermal properties. However, the cost of a computing material with low symmetry and nanoporous patterns increases considerably. Machine-learning-based algorithms for phononic property calculations have been developed and are now utilized frequently as a robust and effective alternative to DFT simulations.51–56 The most appealing solutions at the moment are those that rely on machine learning and are developed from machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIP), which have DFT accuracy but MD (molecular dynamics) efficiency and enable the bridge between first principles based models and continuum models. By using the MLIP technique, Li et al.57 predicted the thermal conductivity of cubic boron arsenide and demonstrated its dependability in obtaining interatomic force constants. The first-principles multiscale modeling via hierarchical employment of DFT simulations was made possible, according to Zhuang et al., by using MLIP to calculate the thermal conductivity of complex graphene/borophene heterostructure interfaces and thermal transport along the heterostructures at continuum level.58 It has been reported that MLIP also plays a crucial role in examining the mechanical properties of materials by measuring the mechanical response, piezoelectricity, and photocatalysis of two-dimensional materials.59–61 These findings demonstrate that MLIP offers a special opportunity for examining structural features and merits further development.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure and electronic structure
The bulk PtPX (X = S, Se, Te) displays an orthorhombic structure, the same as the PdPSe with the Pbca (No. 60) space group. In contrast, the crystal structure of the PtPX monolayer belongs to the P2/c (No. 13) space group with a pentagonal primitive unit cell, containing 4 Pd atoms, 4 P atoms and 4 Se atoms. The P–P bonds seen in Fig. 1(a) join the two pentagonal puckered sublayers that makeup PtPX monolayer complexes. The calculated lattice parameter a(b) values of PtPS, PtPSe, and PtPTe are 5.67(5.70) Å, 5.83(5.87) Å, and 6.05(6.13) Å, respectively. It is clear to observe that the increased atomic radius of the chalcogens causes the lattice parameter of our examined structure, a(b), to increase when the chalcogens change from S, Se to Te. Moreover, the calculated thicknesses of PtPS, PtPSe and PtPTe also increase, with the corresponding values of 6.7 Å, 7.5 Å and 7.6 Å, respectively.

The peeling energy can be expressed as the energy required to strip one-layer from an n–layer structure, which is defined by ΔE = E(n−1) + E(1) − E(n)(1)where n denotes the total layer number. It is observed from Fig. 1(b) that the peeling energies of PtPS, PtPSe and PtPTe are 74 meV per atom, 78 meV per atom and 87 meV per atom, respectively. It resembles the usual layered MoSe2 that was peeled off in the experiment, indicating that the exfoliation of the PtPX monolayer from bulk materials is anticipated.62 To reveal the character of bonds, we plot the electron localization function (ELF), as shown in Fig. 1c. It is observed that the lone pair electron arises around S/Se/Te atoms and that the electron around the P atom also exhibits localization from the ELF of PtPX (X = S, Se, Te). From the isosurface value, it is obvious that the ELF values around the center of P–X (X = S, Se, Te) and P–P bonds are larger than 0.7, suggesting the covalence of the system.
We computed the phonon dispersion spectrum of the PtPX (X = S, Se, Te) monolayer to confirm the dynamic stability. According to Fig. 1(d–f), which shows a phonon curve with all positive frequencies in the whole Brillouin zone, all three structures are dynamically stable and are amenable to experimental acquisition as freestanding monolayer materials.

Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 of the ESI† depicts variations in Pt–P, Pt–X and P–P bond lengths that occurred throughout the AIMD simulations at 300 K and 1000 K. From the evolution of bond length in each scenario, it is clear that there is no abrupt rise in bond length and that the bonds are oscillating around the equilibrium bond length (horizontal line in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1, ESI†). This equilibrium bond length was determined using DFT at 0 K. We also present snapshots of the atomic structure of the dynamic simulations process at 10 ps, as shown in Fig. 2. No atomic reconstruction has taken place in all of the cases examined. As a result, it suggests that PtPX nanosheets (X = S, Se, and Te) are thermodynamically stable at limited temperatures.

The dotted line represents the bond length of the equilibrium structure. 
The thermoelectric (TE) property of a material can be evaluated by the dimensionless figure of merit ZT = S2σT/(κe + κl), where S, σ, T, κe and κl represents the Seebeck coefficient, the electric conductivity, the temperature, the electronic thermal conductivity and the lattice thermal conductivity, respectively. S2σ denotes the power factor (PF), which reflects the electric transport properties. For materials with outstanding thermal conductivity (TE) properties, a high power factor and low thermal conductivity are essential. To comprehend the special electronic characteristics of the PtPX (X = S, Se, Te) monolayer associated with a high TE performance, we first estimated the electronic structure depicted in Fig. 3. The PtPS, PtPSe, and PtPTe monolayers are all indirect bandgap semiconductors, as shown by the density of states (DOS) and band structures, and their respective band gaps with the PBE (HSE06) functional are 1.75 (2.76) eV, 1.54 (2.41) eV, and 1.17 (2.0) eV. All materials under consideration have a valence band maximum (VBM) that is situated at the X high-symmetry point (0.5, 0, 0). While PtPSe(Te)'s conduction band minimum (CBM) is positioned at the point along the Γ–X (Fig. 3b and c) high-symmetry path, and PtPS's CBM is at the point along the M–Γ high-symmetry path (Fig. 3a). Due to Te's lower electronegativity than Se or S, the band gap shrinks as the chalcogen changes from S to Te. The electronic states of the band edge are studied by the projected density of states (PDOS), as illustrated in Fig. 3. The PDOS suggested that the valence band of PtPX is mainly occupied by Pt-dz2 and X (S, Se, Te)-pz orbitals. However, the CBM of the examined materials revealed various orbital characteristics. In PtPS and PtPSe, the CBM is derived from the Pt-dx2−y2, P-px, and S(Se)-py states, while the CBM in the PtPTe monolayer is mainly derived from Pt-dx2−y2 and P-px states. This is in line with the band edge partial charge density in real space.

The transport properties of materials are significantly influenced by the carrier's effective mass and the deformation potential constant close to the VBM and CBM. We computed the electron- and hole-effective mass m* using the following expression based on the parabolic fit of the band structure at the VBM and CBM, (2)where ħ denotes the reduced Planck's constant, and E(k) represents the Kohn–Sham eigenenergy with the wave vector k. The effective masses (m*) of carriers along different transport directions are tabulated in Table 1. From the band structure (Fig. 3), it can be observed that the dispersion of the valence band along x (Γ–X) and y (X–M) are distinctly different in all considered materials, indicating the significant anisotropic characteristic. The band along the y direction is substantially flatter than the band along the x direction, indicating a greater hole effective mass along the y direction. This suggestion is in line with the computed value of hole effective mass stated in Table 1. The average hole effective mass is defined as , and decreases from S to Te. Similar to this, we discovered that the conduction band is likewise anisotropic and that the electron effective mass in the x direction given in Table 1 is greater than that in the y direction, particularly for the PtPSe monolayer, by computing the band dispersion relationship of CBM along the x(y) direction. The average electron effective masses (e) of PtPS, PtPSe and PtPTe are estimated to be 0.38, 1.03 and 0.25, respectively.

Then, to determine the carrier mobility, we determined another important indication called the deformation potential constant El. The El describes the variation of the band edge (VBM and CBM) with the biaxial strain and is determined by , where ΔE is the energy change of band edge, and δ is the deformation rate of the lattice constant. Table 1 shows the El in different directions. The El of CBM is bigger than that of VBM, except for PtPTe, according to the arithmetic mean of the El in the x(y) directions, which demonstrates the strong electron–phonon interaction. In addition, we calculated the elastic constant C2D to predict the stiffness of materials, which could reflect the anharmonic effect of chemical bonding characteristics. We estimated the elastic constant C2D by using the formula , in which S0, E and δ represent the surface area of the equilibrium crystal structure, the total energy of the system and applied strain, and the applied strain (Δl/l), respectively. Due to the elastic constant, PtPTe has the weakest bond out of the three situations.
Finally, the carrier mobility μ was calculated by combing the carrier effect mass, deformation potential, constant and elastic constant based on the deformation potential (DP) theory, proposed by Bardeen and Shockley63. The carrier mobility μ is defined by the formula (3)where C2D represents an elastic constant, m* is the carrier effect mass in the transport direction, md is the average effect mass of hole or electron, and El is the deformation potential constant, respectively. The carrier relaxation time τ was determined via. Table 1 lists the computed hole and electron mobilities for the for PtPX (X = S, Se, Te) monolayer at 300 K along the x (or y) transport direction. The temperature dependence of hole and electron mobility is shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. As evidenced by the various values along various transport directions shown in Fig. 4a and b, both hole and electron carrier mobilities exhibit a distinct anisotropic character that can be attributed to the anisotropic effect mass. Carrier mobility decreases with increasing temperature due to the inverse temperature dependence of μ. The inverse temperature dependency makes it clear that carrier mobility μ decreases with rising temperature. Compared with the mobility along the x direction (1204 cm2 V−1 s−1), the large hole effective mass in the y direction resulted in relatively low mobility (354 cm2 V−1 s−1) for the PtPS monolayer. The smaller electron effective mass in the y direction resulted in large mobility (1386 cm2 V−1 s−1). It is evident from Table 1 that the significant deformation potential constant El, which denotes the potent carrier–phonon coupling effect, is the primary source of the exceptionally low carrier mobility discovered in the PtPSe monolayer. The huge deformation potential constant El along with the large electron effective mass greatly lowers the electron mobility, making it the smallest of all the materials under study, especially close to the conduction band. In contrast, the PtPTe monolayer shows ultrahigh electron mobility (2441 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the x direction, 14591 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the y direction) owing to small electron effective mass and moderate El. The hole mobility is, however, negatively impacted by the PtPTe monolayer's huge El and hole effective mass. Fig. 4c and d show the predicted carrier relaxation times for holes and electrons at various temperatures. For VBM, as shown in Fig. 4c, the relatively modest deformation potential constant El in the y direction results in the prolonged relaxation time for all situations. From Table 1, it is observed that the El(vbm) of PtPS is the smallest and therefore increases the hole relaxation time with 937 (384) fs in the y(x) direction at 300 K. For electron doping near the CBM, the small El and small electron effective mass lead to the increase in electron lifetime for PtPTe (486 (1495) fs in the x(y) direction) regardless of x or y direction. According to the graph in Fig. 4d, the electron relaxation times of these three materials are PtPTe > PtPS > PtPSe in the x(y) direction.

3.2. Thermoelectric properties
By employing the rigid band technique as implemented in the BoltzTraP program to solve the CSTA-based Boltzmann transport equation, the thermoelectric characteristics of PtPX (X = S, Se, Te) were examined. Thermoelectric transport parameters, such as the Seebeck coefficient, the reduced electrical conductivity (σ/τ), and the power factor (S2σ), were determined. The carrier concentration dependent Seebeck coefficient S of the PtPX at finite temperature is shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI.† The Seebeck coefficient S of two dimensional materials can be expressed as ,64,65 where  and n represent the effective mass of density states and carrier concentration, respectively. As a result, S drops as the carrier concentration and temperature rise. In Fig. 5, we plotted the temperature-dependent S at a fixed carrier concentration of 1013 cm−2 for p (n)-type doped PtPX (X = S, Se, Te). The fact that the S for all of the doped candidates aside from n-type doped PtPTe exceeds ∼200 μV K−1 at 300 K, a common lower limit for good TE materials, suggests that the examined system may have a high TE performance.66 As shown in Fig. 5(b), significant anisotropy is observed in both the p- and n-type doped PtPSe monolayer. The anisotropy in n-type PtPS and PtPTe monolayers, on the other hand, is much weaker [Fig. 5a and c], reflecting the almost parabolic CBM depicted in Fig. 3a and c and the remarkably identical electron effective mass listed in Table 1.
 Fig. 5  Seebeck coefficient at a carrier concentration of 1013 cm−2 as a function of temperature for p-type and n-type along x and y directions for (a) PtPS, (b) PtPSe and (c) PtPTe monolayers. 
p-type doped PtPS exhibit high S values compared to n-type doped PtPS because of the large hole-effective mass, particularly in the high-temperature zone. As an illustration, at 800 K, the S values of PtPS with p-type doping in the x (or y) direction increase to 345 (413) μV K−1, but the value of S is 376 μV K−1 for n-type doping. In the PtPSe monolayer, large hole effective mass in the y direction and large electron effective mass in the x direction result in the high S (413 μV K−1 at 800 K) in the y direction for p-type doping and high S (412 μV K−1 at 800 K) in x directions for n-type doping. On the other hand, the S for the PtPTe monolayer at our selected carrier concentration is around 428 μV K−1 and 295 μV K−1 for p-type and n-type dopants at 800 K, respectively. Out of all of these scenarios, PtPTe's lower electron effective mass results in a lower S for n-type doping (Fig. 5c).
Electrical conductivity is a significant component that affects the power factor. Additionally, we computed the electrical conductivity as a function of temperature and carrier concentration. The relationship between conductivity and temperature and chemical potential μ can be expressed as67 (4)where fμ is the Fermi–Dirac distribution function, σαβ(ε) is the energy dependent transport function and Ω is the volume of the unit cell. Note that we can only obtain the σ/τ value by BoltzTraP package within the CSTA. Hence, the relaxation time τ is evaluated by the DP theory mentioned above.
The carrier concentration-dependent σ/τ for the PtPX monolayer at three different temperatures are presented in Fig. S3 of the ESI.† For n-type doping, the σ/τ in the y direction is larger than in the x direction for all three materials. p-type doping showed the opposite trend. In the y direction, the n-type σ/τ is larger than that of the p-type for all three materials. A similar character was observed along the x transport direction except for the PtPSe monolayer. Combining with the relaxation time τ, we obtained the carrier concentration dependent electrical conductivity (Fig. 6) at 300 K, 500 K and 800 K. In the PtPS monolayer, the σ of p-type dopants is higher than that of the n-type in both transport directions. Moreover, the σ along the y direction is higher than that along the x direction (Fig. 6a and b) in the n-type PtPS monolayer due to the large σ/τ and long τ. In the PtPSe monolayer, a very similar effect was seen (Fig. 6c and d). Among the three materials considered, the σ of n-type PtPTe is the highest, which is mainly due to high electron mobility (see Fig. 6f).
 Fig. 6  Electronic conductivity as a function of carrier concentration of (a and b) PtPS, (c and d) PtPSe and (e and f) PtPTe monolayer for p-type and n-type along the x and y direction at 300 K, 500 K and 800 K. 
In general, thermoelectric materials with excellent characteristics require high S and high. The power factor (PF = S2σ) is a composite indicator to determine the electric transport characteristic. At 300 K, 500 K, and 800 K, we estimated the PF for p-type and n-type doping, as shown in Fig. 7. The conductivity is penalized by PtPSe's limited mobility (especially for n-type doping), which causes its peak PF values to be the lowest among the materials under study, as seen in Fig. 7b. The highest peak values of the PF for both n- and p-type dopants are seen in the y direction at the corresponding optimal carrier concentrations in the PtPS and PtPSe monolayers depicted in Fig. 7a and c. The cause of the huge PF in these materials is different. In the PtPS monolayer, the relatively large S in the y direction leads to the large PF for p-type doping, while the large σ in the y direction accompanied by the almost degenerate S dominates the large PF for n-type doping. In contrast, the dominant factor for the large peak values of the PF in the PtPTe monolayer is the large σ in the y direction for both n- and p-type candidates. The peak value PF of PtPS at 300 K, 500 K, and 800 K are 115 mW m−1 K−2, 130 mW m−1 K−2, 123 mW m−1 K−2 for p-type, and 75 mW m−1 K−2, 61 mW m−1 K−2, 54 mW m−1 K−2 for n-type, respectively. Due to high conductivity, the PtPTe exhibits considerable PF, which are 45 mW m−1 K−2, 51 mW m−1 K−2, and 48 mW m−1 K−2 for p-type doping and 297 mW m−1 K−2, 310 mW m−1 K−2, and 317 mW m−1 K−2 for n-type doping.

3.3. Thermal transport properties
By solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation, we were able to determine the lattice thermal conductivity l and evaluate the thermal transport characteristics of the PtPX (X = S, Se, and Te) monolayer. κl is given by68–70 (5)where α represents the transport direction x, y and z, Nq denotes the number of q points in the first Brillouin zone, Vcell denotes the volume of the unit cell, and (q, j) denotes a wave vector q with dispersion branch j. The lattice thermal conductivity κl of each phonon mode is estimated by the specific heat cq,j, group velocity of phonon vq,j,α, and the phonon lifetime τq,j.
First, we calculated the average lattice thermal conductivity (κl) of the diagonal elements of the thermal conductivity tensor. The average κl for the PtPX (X = S, Se and Te) monolayer is plotted in Fig. 8a, and it fluctuates with temperature. The well-known Umklapp-related 1/T temperature dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity occurs. The average κl of PtPS, PtPSe, and PtPTe monolayers are 49 W m−1 K−1, 9 W m−1 K−1 and 9 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K and 17 W m−1 K−1, 3 W m−1 K−1 and 3 W m−1 K−1 at 800 K, respectively. Previous work reported that the lattice thermal conductivity of the PdPS, PdPSe and PdPTe monolayers are predicted to be 72 (60), 65 (44) and 33 (23) W m−1 K−1 along y(x) directions at 300 K.42 Apparently, the lattice thermal conductivity of PtPX is lower than that of PdPX. This is because the lattice thermal conductivity decreases with the increase in the weight of metal atoms. Compared with PtPS, the average κl of PtPSe (Te) is lower. From the cumulative κl (indicated in the insert of Fig. 8a), we acquired that the contribution mainly from the acoustic phonon and low frequency optical branch. Next, we calculated the phonon group velocity and found that the velocity gradually decreased from S to Te, as shown in Fig. 8b. This decreasing phonon velocity is consistent with the suppressed phonon spectrum (presented in Fig. 1), originating from the heavy atomic mass. As discussed above, κl ∝ v, which signified that smaller phonon velocity resulted in lower κl. However, this does not explain why PtPSe and PtPTe exhibit almost identical thermal conductivity.

It is well known that another important aspect of the κl is the anharmonic phonon–phonon scattering. Therefore, we investigated the anharmonic effect through first principles calculation. The computed phonon lifespan as a function of frequency is shown in Fig. 8c. In the low-frequency band, the phonon lifetime in PtPSe is shorter than in PtPTe from the perspective of phonon lifetime. Thus, the short phonon lifetime is the main contributor to the low κl of PtPSe. Furthermore, we calculated the scattering phase space W, which includes the adsorption (W+) and emission process (W−), to estimate the three-phonon scattering probability. The potential scattering channels, which can also be reflected in phonon structure, were represented by the three-phonon scattering phase space. In Fig. 8d, the scattering phase space is presented as a function of frequency. The PtPTe monolayer exhibits improved scattering space when compared to PtPS and PtPSe, regardless of the adsorption or emission procedure. This indicates a high scattering probability, which in turn results in a short phonon lifespan. The phonon spectrum can also be used to investigate this. PtPTe has a lower phonon frequency than PtPS and PtPSe, and the suppressed phonon mode enhances the interaction between various modes.
We examined the anharmonic effect from the standpoint of charge density of chemical bonds to identify the underlying physical cause that predominates the shorter phonon lifespan of the PtPSe monolayer. Fig. 9 shows the difference in charge density value of different chemical bonds of PtPX (S, Se, Te), obtained by the formulaΔρPtPX = ρPtPX − ρPt − ρP − ρX,where ρi is the charge density of i. One may notice that different chemical bonds exhibit distinctive charge gains or losses from the charge density of the bond, indicating varying chemical bond strengths. A Pt atom is bound to two P atoms and two X atoms, respectively, as seen by the crystal structure. The charge density changes of two Pt–X bonds (labeled as bond1 and bond2) for PtPX are plotted in Fig. 9. As seen in Fig. 9b, there is a little variation in the charge density between Pt–X bonds of PtPSe across the whole spectrum of chemical bonds when compared to PtPS and PtPTe. This demonstrates that the asymmetrical chemical bonds surrounding the Pt atom in PtPSe lead to more asymmetrical vibration patterns, boosting the anharmonic effect and shortening the phonon lifetime. As a result, it is established that the asymmetrical connection plays a crucial part in determining the anharmonic effect of materials.

In addition to the lattice thermal conductivity κl, the electronic thermal conductivity κe also play a vital role in total κ for two-dimensional materials.71 The electronic thermal conductivity κe can be acquired via Wiedemann–Franz law κe = LσT,72 where L denotes the Lorenz number (L = 2.45 × 10−8 W Ω K−2). Fig. S4 of the ESI† depicts the κe of 300 K plotted against the carrier concentration. According to the Wiedemann–Franz law, the κe shows a similar behavior with the σ. It is observed that the κe of PtPTe is the largest among these three materials due to the large σ. In all cases, the κe increase when the doping levels and carrier concentration are increasing.
3.4. Figure of merit ZT
We can now calculate the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT to assess the thermoelectric properties of these materials after obtaining all the transport coefficients mentioned above, including the Seebeck coefficient (S), electronic conductivity (σ), electronic thermal conductivity (κe), and lattice thermal conductivity (κl). In Fig. 10, the ZT values of PtPX (X = S, Se, Te) monolayers are plotted for both p-type and n-type doping at different temperatures. These three materials display an anisotropic power factor, which results in an anisotropic ZT value along the various transport directions because of the anisotropic S and σ caused by the anisotropic carrier effective mass in those directions (see Fig. 10). The most promising candidate identified by our calculation is the n-type doped PtPTe monolayer, which exhibits an ultrahigh ZT of 2.46 (5.94) in the y directions at 300 (800) K, much higher than the value determined in previous studies, as listed in Table 2. The high electrical conductivities at the examined doping levels and the very low lattice thermal conductivity combine to produce this high ZT value. We also observe a large ZT at 800 K in other cases, e.g., for the p- and n-type doped PtPS with the values 1.68 and 1.23 along the y direction; for the p- and n-type doped PtPSe with the value of 1.26 (y direction) and 1.25 (x directions). We know from earlier research that a 2D material-based field-effect transistor73,74 carrier doping level can reach as high as 4 × 1014 cm−2. It should be mentioned that the existing experimental setup makes it possible to achieve the ideal doping carriers for our researched system. Therefore, our findings suggested that the phosphochalcogenides systems based on noble metals are prospective thermoelectric materials.

Electronic devices are advancing toward high performance, miniaturization, low power consumption, and self-powered gadgets due to the rapid development of microelectronic technology. Thermoelectric (TE) devices based on the Seebeck effect and Peltier effect are a type of energy conversion device that have the advantages of solid-state operation, noiselessness, high reliability, good stability, small size, etc. These devices are in urgent need for applications and a wide range of market prospects in the fields of high flux electronic components and low power consumption electronic devices self-power supply. A potential power source for self-powered Internet of Things (IoT) devices,79 such as pressure sensors, calculators and blue diodes, was demonstrated by micro thermoelectric generators (TEGs) based on the Seebeck effect, which was created using the femtosecond laser direct writing method. These TEGs realized an output of 494 mV at ΔT = 33.1 K, which meets the power manager's threshold. Particularly, thermoelectric generators make it possible to harvest electricity from curved heat sources, such as hot pipes and human skin, offering a viable option for supplying wearable electronics, implantable electronics, and medical devices with consistent power.3,8,80 Additionally, a thermoelectric device demonstrated a potential light detection capability. A light-concentrated solar generator and sensor that can produce a high voltage and exhibit a significant sensitivity to light was created by Zhu et al.81 It was stated that TE devices have a lot of promise for use in light sensing applications.81 Thermoelectric coolers, which are based on the Peltier effect, are capable of immediately converting electricity to a temperature difference. Because they can operate continuously, they are interesting candidates for high-performance thermal management of electronics, such as chip cooling.7 Therefore, it is crucial for the advancement of thermoelectric science and technology that research is continually conducted on new TE materials for TE devices.
4. Conclusions
Using semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory and calculations based on density functional theory, we have presented the results of a thorough investigation of the structural stability, electronic transport, and thermoelectric transport features of the PtPX (X = S, Se, and Te) monolayers. It is shown that the PtPX (X = S, Se, Te) monolayers are indirect bandgap semiconductors with a band gap of 2.76 eV, 2.41 eV and 2.0 eV at the HSE06 level for PtPS, PtPSe and PtPTe, respectively. The calculated electronic properties show that this system exhibits moderate carrier mobility. In particular, for PtPTe, the carrier mobility is up to ∼2441 cm2 V−1 s−1 (14591 cm2 V−1 s−1) in the x(y) transport direction for n-type doping. The high power factor observed in PtPTe due to its large electrical conductivity, with PF values of 45 mW m−1 K−2@300 K, 51 mW m−1 K−2@500 K, and 48 mW m−1 K−2@800 K for p-type doping and 297 mW m−1 K−2@300 K, 310 mW m−1 K−2@500 K, and 317 mW m−1 K−2@800 K for n-type doping.
The primary cause of PtPSe's significantly lower thermal conductivity as compared to other investigated options is the asymmetry of the chemical link. The average κl at 800 K is 17 W m−1 K−1, 3.2 W m−1 K−1 and 3.3 W m−1 K−1 for PtPS, PtPSe and PtPTe monolayers, respectively. Based on the above results, we obtained the optimal ZT@800 K values with p-type (n-type) doping of 1.68 (1.23), 1.26 (1.25), and 2.47 (5.94) for PtPS, PtPSe and PtPTe respectively. According to our research, compounds made of metal-based phosphochalcogenides have the potential to be thermoelectric materials, particularly at high temperatures. We anticipate that experimental researchers will be motivated by our discovery to further explore the thermoelectric properties of layered metal-based phosphochalcogenides materials.
