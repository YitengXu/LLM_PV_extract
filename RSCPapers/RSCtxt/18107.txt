    , Accepted 19th July 2013First published on 22nd July 2013AbstractHybrid solar cells with tert-butylthiol exchanged CdSe multipod acceptors and novel semi-random P3HTT-DPP and alternating PCDTBT copolymer donors were studied, giving high performance devices with power conversion efficiencies >3%.
The use of semiconductor nanocrystals as electron acceptors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) hybrid solar cells has garnered significant interest because nanocrystals offer spectral tunability through quantum confinement effects, high dielectric constants, and high electron mobilities when compared to the more commonly used fullerene acceptors.1–5 Furthermore, the ability to tune the morphology of semiconductor nanocrystals has been used to significantly improve device performance, with anisotropic nanorod and branched multipod-based acceptors giving devices that exhibit increased short circuit current densities (JSC) relative to those devices made from spherical quantum dots.1,6,7 In addition to spectral and morphological tunability, recent work has demonstrated the ability to simultaneously increase both JSC and the open circuit potential (VOC) in hybrid solar cells through judicious choice of ligands on the nanocrystal surface.8
While numerous reports have investigated the effects of nanocrystal size, morphology, composition, and surface ligands on hybrid solar cell performance, the majority of these have been carried out using a singular donor material per study from a small sub-set of polymers.2–4 By far, the most commonly used donor polymer for hybrid solar cells has been poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), which gives power conversion efficiencies up to 3.0% with CdSe acceptors;9 however, the band gap (Eg ≈ 1.9 eV) of this polymer provides poor spectral overlap with the solar spectrum. Consequently, more recent focus has been placed on poly[2,6-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]-dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT), which is a low band gap (Eg = 1.45 eV) copolymer comprised of alternating electron rich and electron poor subunits. As a result of improved photon harvesting from the PCPDTBT, device efficiencies from 3.2–4.6% have been reported for hybrid solar cells that use CdSe acceptors.10–12 Although there have been several reports that use PCPDTBT as the donor copolymer in hybrid solar cells, there have been relatively few reports that use other donor copolymer types in hybrid systems. Expansion of the donor library in these systems will ultimately be relevant for extension to ternary blend or tandem hybrid solar cells.
Herein, we extend the versatility of CdSe nanocrystal acceptors by applying them to a novel semi-random copolymer and a relatively unexplored alternating copolymer for hybrid solar cells. The semi-random poly(3-hexylthiophene-thiophene-diketopyrrolopyrrole) (P3HTT-DPP) copolymer is based on electron rich 3-hexylthiophene (3HT) and thiophene (T) units and an electron poor diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit (Fig. 1(a)), and is used for the first time in a hybrid solar cell. P3HTT-DPP containing 10% DPP, 80% 3HT, and 10% thiophene not only possesses a low band gap (Eg = 1.51 eV), but also has a very broad and intense absorption profile across the whole visible spectrum into the near-infrared.13–15 We also utilize the alternating copolymer poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT; Fig. 1(a)). In addition to possessing a band gap of Eg = 1.88 eV, the carbazole unit of PCDTBT gives it a deep HOMO level, which in turn leads to higher VOC values as compared to P3HT- and PCPDTBT-based devices.16,17 High efficiency polymer:CdSe BHJ hybrid solar cells were fabricated with P3HTT-DPP and PCDTBT using tert-butylthiol (tBT)-exchanged CdSe multipods as the versatile acceptor phase, and these results were compared to P3HT and PCPDTBT reference devices.
 Fig. 1  (a) Structure of the polymers used in the hybrid solar cells and (b) the corresponding hybrid polymer:CdSe(tBT) multipod thin film absorption spectra. 
The CdSe multipods were synthesized following a modified literature procedure.11 The native ligand (NL) shell on the resulting CdSe multipods was subsequently ligand exchanged by treatment with tBT utilizing pyridine as the base.18 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a transmission electron micrograph for the CdSe(tBT) multipods are given in Fig. 2. A majority of the multipods have an average diameter of 5 nm and arm lengths ranging between 25–35 nm by TEM analysis. TGA clearly displays the efficacy of tBT treatment in reducing the total organic mass content of the nanocrystals as compared to CdSe(NL). The CdSe(NL) multipods display a relatively large mass loss (∼13.0%) at ca. 400 °C, which can be primarily attributed to loss of octylphosphonate; whereas the CdSe(tBT) multipods have a substantially reduced overall mass loss (∼4.8%) that corresponds to the decomposition of tBT at ca. 200 °C.18 Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and FT-IR spectroscopy were used to further corroborate the efficacy of tBT exchange on the CdSe multipods. EDX spectra clearly show the presence of a phosphorus peak in CdSe(NL) from the octylphosphonate ligands, which is replaced by the appearance of a peak corresponding to sulfur in CdSe(tBT) (Fig. 2(b)). Furthermore, quantitative FT-IR spectra utilizing an internal standard show a significant reduction in the ν(C–H) stretching intensities at 2800–3050 cm−1 in CdSe(tBT) relative to CdSe(NL), again corroborating exchange of tBT for the native octylphosphonate ligands (Fig. 2(d)). In total, these data suggest that the tBT ligand exchange is quantitative, thereby providing a very well defined ligand shell on the CdSe multipods. Given the 200 °C decomposition temperature of the surface-bound tBT, and the identical TGA traces for CdSe(tBT) before and after high vacuum treatment (10−6 Torr), it is expected that these ligands remain intact on the CdSe multipods after device fabrication and annealing (vide infra). This stands in contrast to the typical pyridine ligand exchange procedure, which leaves behind a mixed ligand shell on the nanocrystal surface.8,18

Active layers for hybrid solar cells with the general device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:CdSe BHJ/ZnO (20–25 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated by spin-casting blends of P3HTT-DPP, PCDTBT, P3HT, or PCPDTBT with CdSe(tBT) multipods dispersed in 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The exact CdSe/polymer ratios used for the BHJ blends studied here were determined empirically during device optimizations for each polymer; however the optimized wt/wt ratios for these four different polymers ranged only between 6.2–4.0:1 (or 1.3–0.8:1 vol/vol) CdSe/polymer. The thicknesses of the active layers were measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry to be between 65–75 nm for P3HTT-DPP:CdSe, 75–85 nm for PCDTBT:CdSe, 80–90 nm for P3HT:CdSe, and 90–100 nm for PCPDTBT:CdSe. This range of thicknesses between polymers is a result of the different concentrations used for each optimized polymer:CdSe(tBT) multipod blend (ESI†), in which the final film thickness was proportional to the total concentration of the deposited solution. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocrystals were used as an electron transport layer between the active layer and the Al cathode to improve fill factor (FF) and JSC.19 The devices were annealed at 160 °C for 10 min prior to thermal deposition of the Al cathode.
The normalized absorption spectra of the polymer:CdSe(tBT) multipod hybrid films are given in Fig. 1(b). The CdSe multipods possess an optical band gap of Eg = 1.90 eV with an absorption cut-off at 665 nm (ESI,† Fig. S1). P3HTT-DPP complements the absorption profile of the CdSe(tBT) multipods by extending absorption into the near-infrared region of the solar spectrum. Photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements were performed for each of the hybrid films, using the optimized wt/wt ratios for each device (ESI,† Fig. S2). These results suggest charge transfer or energy transfer between the two phases in the form of significantly reduced PL intensity in the hybrid films as compared to the neat polymer films, with 61% and 47% PL quenching observed at the peak emission wavelength for hybrid films with PCDTBT and P3HTT-DPP donor copolymers, respectively. This compares with 86% and 73% PL quenching observed at the peak emission wavelength for hybrid films with P3HT and PCPDTBT donor polymers, respectively.
An overlay of the current–voltage (I–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the four optimized polymer:CdSe(tBT) multipod hybrid solar cells is given in Fig. 3, and a summary of champion and average device parameters is given in Table 1. The integrated EQE values reproduced the JSC values obtained from I–V measurements for each system to within 8–13%. In each polymer:CdSe(tBT) multipod blend, the EQE spectra demonstrate cooperative spectral response from both the polymer and nanocrystal phases. The contribution from the CdSe(tBT) multipod phase is apparent in the appearance of excitonic peak-like features in the EQE spectra at ca. 505 and 620 nm, and an increasing photoresponse at high energies presumably resulting from contributions from the nanocrystals (Fig. 3(b)). Furthermore, the EQE onset matches the absorption onset for each of the hybrid films (Fig. 1(b)).

Similar short circuit current densities were obtained for the PCDTBT:CdSe(tBT) and P3HTT-DPP:CdSe(tBT) hybrid solar cells (JSC = 10.0 and 9.5 mA cm−2, respectively), even though the band gap of P3HTT-DPP is 370 meV lower than that of PCDTBT. The high current obtained for the PCDTBT:CdSe(tBT) device results from a surprisingly strong photoresponse, with an EQE > 35% from ca. 400–610 nm that surpasses 60% from 470–520 nm. As a result of its lower band gap, the P3HTT-DPP:CdSe(tBT) device gives an EQE response that extends past 800 nm, with EQE between 30–50% at 400–700 nm (Fig. 3(b)).
Among the four systems investigated, the PCDTBT:CdSe(tBT) hybrid solar cell gives the highest observed VOC of 0.82 V. This compares to a VOC of 0.70 V for P3HTT-DPP:CdSe(tBT), which has a similar open circuit potential to hybrid solar cells made from P3HT and PCPDTBT (both 0.71 V). As previously discussed, the higher VOC for PCDTBT:CdSe(tBT) results from the deeper HOMO level of PCDTBT (∼400 meV) relative to the other donor polymers.16,17 This leads to a power conversion efficiency of 3.16% in the resulting PCDTBT:CdSe(tBT) hybrid solar cell, which represents a significant improvement in performance over the one previous example of a PCDTBT:CdSe device by Lek et al. (JSC = 6.2 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.67 V, FF 0.46, ηchamp = 1.91%).20 For the P3HTT-DPP:CdSe(tBT) hybrid solar cell, a similar power conversion efficiency of 3.06% was achieved. These two devices slightly outperform a reference P3HT:CdSe(tBT) device (JSC = 8.3 mA cm−2, ηchamp = 2.88%) as a result of higher photocurrent generation with the copolymers. Conversely, the reference PCPDTBT:CdSe(tBT) hybrid solar cell gives the highest power conversion efficiency out of the series, with ηchamp = 4.05%. This result is consistent with PCPDTBT:CdSe(tBT) giving the highest photocurrent (JSC = 11.6 mA cm−2) and a strong EQE response out to ∼850 nm. Collectively, these hybrid solar cells exhibited stable device performance over the course of several weeks when stored in the dark under an inert atmosphere between measurements. Moreover, this report of high efficiency hybrid solar cells across a range of four different polymers is unprecedented.
In summary, we used tBT-exchanged CdSe multipods as the acceptor phase in BHJ hybrid solar cells with four different donor polymers, including a novel semi-random copolymer and an alternating copolymer. The CdSe(tBT) multipod acceptors gave high performing devices for each of these very different polymers using the same device structure and very similar CdSe/polymer ratios, which demonstrates the versatility of this acceptor system. Ligand exchange allows for quantitative removal of the native ligands from the CdSe multipods with concomitant installation of a well-defined tBT ligand shell; this small, tightly bound ligand assists in charge collection in the hybrid solar cells. Both PCDTBT and P3HTT-DPP give devices with high current densities, while PCDTBT:CdSe(tBT) gives the highest open circuit potential relative to the other hybrid solar cells. Champion power conversion efficiencies of 3.06 and 3.16% were obtained for P3HTT-DPP:CdSe(tBT) and PCDTBT:CdSe(tBT) hybrid solar cells, respectively.
