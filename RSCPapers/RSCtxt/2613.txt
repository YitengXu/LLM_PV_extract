    , Accepted 17th May 2015First published on 18th May 2015AbstractThis work reports on the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of oleylamine-stabilized lanthanide-doped LaF3 nanoparticles isolated or dispersed in polydimethylsiloxane (pdms). The hexagonal Eu(III)-doped LaF3 nanoparticles have the mean size of 6 nm and are stabilized by oleylamine molecules, allowing their dispersion in pdms. Surface effects modify the emission properties of the Eu(III)-doped LaF3 isolated nanoparticles implying different emission profiles. Isolated nanoparticles show higher Judd–Ofelt emission intensity parameter values than the bulk ones. Time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy and lifetime measurements indicate the presence of at least two different chemical environments for Eu(III) ions, one being at the nanoparticle surface and the other at the bulk. The upconversion emission mechanism of Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped LaF3 nanoparticles is dependent on the relative amount of Er(III)/Yb(III) in the sample and it may be explained by 2.5 photons, instead of the traditional mechanism involving 2 photons. Oleylamine surface passivation of Eu(III)-doped LaF3 nanoparticles dispersed in pdms avoids the influence of the siloxane polymer on the luminescence properties, keeping their emission spectral profile unchanged. Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped LaF3 nanoparticles exhibit the Er(III) 1540 nm emission with FWHM = 75 nm for isolated or pdms-dispersed nanoparticles, which may allow the application of such materials in polymer based erbium-doped planar waveguides. The modified methodology of synthesis allows obtaining lanthanide-doped LaF3 nanoparticles with high emission lifetimes with no need for the shell protecting core approach.
Introduction
Lanthanide (Ln(III))-containing materials are largely used for many applications in biological imaging,1 optical devices2 and solar cells3 due to their interesting luminescence properties such as long emitting state lifetime, narrow emission lines and high color purity, as consequence of their intraconfigurational 4f → 4f transitions. For optical purposes, Ln(III)-doped inorganic hosts are the most used materials due to, among several properties, their thermal stability and a large optical transparency window. Ln(III) ions when used as doping agents have the ability to modify the properties of the rare earth (RE(III)) oxides,4 oxyfluorides5 and fluorides,6–8 some of the most studied Ln(III)-doped inorganic hosts.9 The properties of the inorganic host such as the Ln(III)-doped chemical environment have an impact on the Ln(III) emission, and an important factor directly dependent on the host is the Ln(III) emission quenching by multiphonon relaxation. In that sense lanthanide fluoride crystals when doped with several Ln(III) ions exhibit excellent luminescence properties such as upconversion emission as their energy of lattice phonons is low, in the order of 400 cm−1. Nanosized Ln(III)-doped lanthanide fluoride materials have advantages of the well-known luminescence properties and offer innumerous applications of these materials once the nanoparticles are embedded or processed with polymers to yield luminescent nanocomposites8,10 or used directly in biological systems for bioimaging or biolabeling applications.8,11,12 On the other hand, emission quenching due to surface effects becomes a relevant issue in the Ln(III) emission of the Ln(III)-doped lanthanide fluoride nanoparticles, besides the inhomogeneous characteristics of Ln(III) emission due to changes in the chemical environment imposed by a high surface area.
The emission of lanthanide ions ranges from the UV to near-infrared region of electromagnetic spectra. For example, Gd(III) displays ultraviolet emission while Tb(III) green and Er(III) infrared emission. A Eu(III) ion shows red sharp emission from 4f6 → 4f6 transitions and probably is the most used lanthanide luminescence activator. It is considered as a spectroscopic probe mainly due to the characteristics of the forced-electric dipole 5D0 → 7F2 transition which leads to changes in its emission intensity according to the symmetry of the chemical environment around the ion, which is the so-called hypersensitive Eu(III) transition.13,14 The intensity comparison of this transition with the allowed magnetic dipole 5D0 → 7F1 transition, which has its intensity almost unaffected by symmetry changes, offers information about charge distribution symmetry around the Eu(III) ion. The non-degenerated 5D0 → 7F0 transition provides information regarding the presence of more than one crystallographic site in the host matrix and also the nephelauxetic effect. Furthermore, Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters15,16 can be obtained from the Eu(III) emission spectra, allowing a better understanding of the Eu(III) chemical environment. These features allows a systematic study of the Eu(III) distribution in the nanoparticles of inorganic hosts and gives structural information about the host matrix in the nanometric regime.
Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped lanthanide fluoride nanoparticles are largely studied for their photonic applications of Er(III) emission in the 1550 nm region17–19 and for up-conversion materials,20 due to the low phonon energy and high chemical stability of these fluoride matrices. In both cases, Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doping is required, since Er(III) ions possess low absorption cross-section in the 980 nm region, so a Yb(III) ion is used as a sensitizer to improve the energy absorption and consequently the Er(III) Stokes and anti-Stokes emission intensities. The Er(III) Stokes emission in the 1550 nm region is located in the third telecommunication window (1500–1600 nm – the “C” band), allowing its luminescence to be used in optical amplifiers in this region.21
The upconversion phenomenon was first observed by Auzel22 in 1966 for Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped CaWO4, and it is described as the sequential absorption of low energy photons that are converted into higher energy photons, characterizing an anti-Stokes emission. Usually, this phenomenon involves the absorption of infrared photons that are converted to near-infrared, visible or UV photons and requires low phonon energy of the Ln(III) host, in order to avoid non-radiative deactivation of the emitting levels. Among the inorganic hosts, rare earth fluorides are the most suitable ones due to their low phonon energy, high thermal and chemical stability. The green, red or blue emission resulting from the NIR excitation of these samples is interesting to be used in bioimaging, once the excitation at 980 nm has higher penetration and avoids tissue autofluorescence and photodamage of biological media.23 The Er(III)/Yb(III) relative concentration in the host may influence the relative intensity of green/red emission bands and also the upconversion mechanism, which is evaluated by the laser power dependence of upconversion emission bands following the potency law: I = Pn, where I is the upconversion intensity, P is the laser power and n the number of photons involved in the process.24,25
Ln(III)-doped nanoparticles can be prepared by many different chemical routes: sol gel,26 decomposition of complexes,5,27 precipitation28 and hydrothermal methods.29 These methods can result in nanoparticles that are easily dispersible in aqueous media,28 for biological applications and also in organic media,30 allowing the dispersion in organic and siloxane polymers. Recently, the combination of luminescent nanoparticles with polymeric materials has resulted in interesting hybrid materials30 for optical applications.10,31,32 However, the combination of the luminescence properties of Ln(III)-doped nanoparticles with those of the siloxane-based materials has been little explored in the literature. They show numerous advantages, such as easy manipulation, low temperature for chemical processing and low toxicity, and can be shaped as self-supported materials or thin films. Another important advantage of silicone polymers is the possibility of modulation of their refractive index using side-chain functionalization33,34 or the control of cross linker molar ratios. The latter is described in the present work making these materials compatible with silica optical fibers, opening new opportunities for the synthesis of photonic materials showing potential applications as flexible waveguides.35
As already mentioned, there are many chemical routes to synthesize Ln(III)-doped nanoparticles that can be dispersible in organic media and consequently in siloxane-based polymers. Schäfer et al.6 used an interesting low temperature method to synthesize NaYF4 nanoparticles stabilized with oleylamine and the oleylamine–oleic acid mixture used to control the nanoparticle size and also the formation of the cubic phase of NaYF4. Wang et al.30 also synthesized oleic acid modified Er(III)/Yb(III)-doped LaF3 nanoparticles and prepared a hybrid material dispersing the nanoparticles in a PMMA matrix. The luminescence properties of the resulting material indicated that it is a promising material for the synthesis of polymer-based planar waveguide amplifiers. Gai et al.31 and Wang et al.32 described the synthesis of oleic acid stabilized up-converting lanthanide-doped NaYF4 and NaYbF4 nanoparticles dispersed in a commercial pdms composed of a mixture of SYLGARD silicone elastomer 184 and a curing agent (Dow Corning corp.), aiming at the fabrication of monolites for 3D imaging applications, showing that in fact the nanoparticle dispersion in siloxane-based polymers has several possible applications.
This work describes an unpublished hybrid material combining interesting chemical and thermal properties of a silicone polymer and well-dispersed core-only luminescence nanoparticles with potential application as an erbium-doped planar waveguide amplifier. Silicone–lanthanide nanoparticles are rarely described in the literature, where the focus is usually on lanthanide complexes dispersed into silicone polymers or lanthanide nanoparticles dispersed in other organic polymers, such as PMMA, which totally differs from the high chemical and thermal stabilities of pdms and also does not allow the easy control of the refractive index to match silica optical fibers for the preparation of optical devices. The resulting hybrid materials present high thermal stability and their refractive index can be modulated by changing the molar ratios of used cross linkers. Eu(III)-doped LaF3 nanoparticles were synthesized, by a modification of the methodology described by Schafer et al.,6 in order to use Eu(III) as a spectroscopic probe of the chemical environment in the nanoparticles. The upconversion emission of Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped LaF3 nanoparticles was investigated and a different upconversion mechanism has been proposed. The modified methodology of synthesis allows obtaining lanthanide-doped LaF3 nanoparticles with high emission lifetimes with no need for a shell protecting core approach.
Experimental procedure and characterization
Oleilamine-stabilized Ln(III)-doped LaF3 (Ln = Eu(III) or Er(III)/Yb(III)) nanoparticles were prepared by the modification of the method described by Schäfer et al.6 In a typical procedure 0.500 g of Ln2O3 (Ln = La(III), Eu(III), Er(III)/Yb(III) Aldrich, 99.9%) were added to a stoichiometric amount of glacial acetic acid (Synth, 99.7%) along with 10.0 mL of deionized water. After water evaporation, lanthanide acetate precursors were obtained. In a round bottom flask 1.15 mmol of Ln(CH3COO)3 precursors, Ln = La(III), Eu(III) or Er(III)/Yb(III), were added to 3.46 mmol of NH4F (Synth, 99%) and 12.5 mL of oleylamine (Aldrich, 70%). This mixture was stirred and heated at 55 °C under the nitrogen atmosphere for 3 h. After this time, the obtained dispersion was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 5 minutes and the resulting solid was washed several times with ethanol (Synth, 99.5%). Once the nanoparticles were obtained, a thermal treatment under the nitrogen atmosphere at 280 °C for 12 hours was performed in order to remove the excess of oleylamine from the nanoparticle surface and promote the crystallization of LaF3.
Lanthanide chlorides were prepared as precursors for the bulk LaF3 synthesis. To 0.5 mmol of Ln2O3 (Ln = La(III), Eu(III) or Er(III)/Yb(III), Aldrich, 99.9%) a stoichiometric amount of concentrated HCl (Aldrich, 37%) was added resulting in a LnCl3 aqueous solution. Lanthanide content was determined by EDTA complexiometric analysis using acetate buffer and xylenol orange as an indicator. Bulk LaF3 solids were obtained by adding dropwise 10.0 mL of an aqueous solution containing 1.0 mmol LnCl3 (Ln = La(III), Eu(III), Er(III)/Yb(III)) to a 20.0 mL aqueous solution containing 3.0 mmol of NaF (Synth, 99.0%) at 75 °C. After magnetic stirring at 75 °C for 2 h the bulk sample was precipitated by the addition of 20.0 mL of absolute ethanol. The solid was isolated by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 5 minutes, and washed several times with ethanol. The crystallization of bulk samples was achieved through thermal treatment at 500 °C for 3 h under the N2 atmosphere. Nanoparticle (NPLaFEu) and bulk samples (bulkLaFEu) were doped with 15% mol of Eu(III) ions or co-doped with 15% mol of Er(III) + Yb(III). The proportion between Er(III):Yb(III) both in nanoparticles and bulk samples were 1:1, (NPLaFErYb11 and bulkLaFErYb11), 1:2 (NPLaFErYb12 and bulkLaFErYb12) and 1:3, (NPLaFErYb13 and bulkLaFErYb13).
The synthesized Ln(III)-doped LaF3 nanoparticles were dispersed in polydimethylsiloxane (pdms) to yield luminescent self-supported composite membranes. The oleylamine-stabilized nanoparticles were dispersed in 3.0 mL of hexane (Synth, 99%) and added to 1.0 g of polydimethylsiloxane hydride terminated (pdms, Aldrich Mw = 580). This mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h, followed by the addition of 0.097 g of tetravinylsilane (tvs, ABCR) and mixtures of 0.058 g/0.112 g (1:1 molar ratio) and 0.039 g/0.150 g (1:2 molar ratio) of tetravinylsilane/divinylbenzene (dvb, Aldrich 80%), respectively, resulting in three different cross-linking conditions. After stirring for 1 h, 2 drops of platinum–divinyltetramethyldisiloxane catalyst (Dow Corning) were added and the resulting suspensions were cured by transferring into a Teflon mold, resulting in luminescent self-supported membranes. The NPLaFEu-containing pdms self-supported membrane samples cross-linked with tvs or tvs:dvb mixtures of 1:1 and 1:2 molar ratios were named as MtvsNP, Mtvsdvb11NP and Mtvsdvb12NP, respectively. The pdms self-supported membrane containing NPErYb11, NPErYb12 and NPErYb13 samples were cross-linked using the tvs:dvb 1:2 molar ratio and were named as MErYb11, MErYb12 and MErYb13, respectively.
The FT-IR spectra of samples were obtained using the equipment IlluminatiR II Smiths by the Attenuated Total Reflectance technique (ATR) with an IR microprobe for an optical microscopy setup using a diamond crystal and objective lens with 32× magnification. The spectra were obtained in the range of 4000–650 cm−1 at 4 cm−1 resolution. Thermal analysis was performed using the SDT Q600 v8.1 DSC-TGA equipment at a 25–1000 °C temperature range with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under synthetic air flow of 100 mL min−1. The powder X Ray diffraction was recorded on a Shimadzu XRD 7000 diffractometer using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the 2θ range of 4–70° at the rate of 2° min−1. The Raman spectra were obtained from 200 to 530 cm−1 on a Horiba Jobin-Yvon T64000 spectrometer using 514 nm argon laser at 2.0 mW power over the samples. The size distribution and morphology of the nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEM-2010 (JEOL) microscope operating at 200 kV with 0.25 nm resolution. The TEM images of the nanoparticles containing pdms samples were obtained on a Libra-Zeiss microscope operating at 120 kV with 3.7 Å resolution. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the membranes were obtained on a spectrophotometer Carry 5000 in the transmittance mode in 200–2500 nm interval at a rate of 200 nm min−1. The refractive index measurements were performed using a Metricon 2010 equipment by a prism coupling method with TE polarization using a 1535 nm laser. The photoluminescence data were obtained on a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter (Horiba FL3-22-iHR320), with double-gratings (1200 g mm−1, 330 nm blaze) in the excitation monochromator and double-gratings (1200 g mm−1, 500 nm blaze) in the emission monochromator. The excitation and emission spectra in the UV-Vis range were recorded using a 450 W Xenon lamp ozone free (Ushio) as the excitation source. The excitation spectra were obtained in the 240–500 nm range and corrected in real time according to the lamp intensity and optical system of the excitation monochromator using a silicon diode as a reference. The emission spectra were recorded using the front face mode at 22.5° in the 420–720 nm range and corrected according to the optical system of the emission monochromator and the photomultiplier (Hamamatsu R928P) response. Time-resolved emission spectra and emission decay curves were obtained using a pulsed 150 W Xenon lamp as the excitation source and measured using the multichannel system (TCSPC) and 1024 channels. The NIR emission spectra were obtained using a IHR emission monochromator (600 g mm−1, 1200 nm blaze) in the range of 1400–1700 nm using a 980 nm laser (Crystalaser DL980-1WT0) as the excitation source and a Hamamatsu H10330A-75 photomultiplier. The emission decay curves in the NIR spectral range were recorded using a 980 nm SpectraLED (Jobin Yvon) as a pulsed excitation source.
Results and discussion
Oleylamine-stabilized Eu(III)-doped and Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped LaF3 nanoparticles
Fig. S1 in the ESI† shows the FT-IR spectra of the NPLaFEu sample and the pure oleylamine as a reference. The FT-IR spectra of Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped nanoparticles is similar and not shown for simplicity. The presence of bands from 3011 to 2850 cm−1 attributed to the C–H vibrations as well as the H–CC–H cis stretching mode at 1660 cm−1 can be observed in both spectra shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). One may also observe the symmetric deformation modes of NH2 and CH2 at 1585 and 1452 cm−1, respectively. These deformation modes have their intensity ratio changed from the pure oleylamine to the oleylamine at the nanoparticles surface, suggesting a specific interaction of the oleylamine molecules with the nanoparticle surface by the NH2 group. These bands indicate that ethanol washing and thermal treatment do not provide the total removal of the oleylamine molecules that are passivating the nanoparticle surface. Another evidence of nanoparticle passivation by oleylamine molecules comes from the thermogravimetric curves shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) where it is possible to observe three events of mass loss. The first event from room temperature to 100 °C is assigned to the loss of adsorbed water molecules, followed by the second at 370 °C assigned to oleylamine decomposition. The third event at 950 °C is attributed to the LaOF phase formation due to the presence of oxygen in the synthetic air atmosphere used in the analysis. The X-ray diffraction analysis of a sample thermally treated at 950 °C (ESI,† Fig. S3) confirms the LaOF phase formation.
From the X-ray diffraction pattern of NPLaFEu (Fig. 1) one may observe that the crystallographic pattern of NPLaFEu can be attributed to hexagonal LaF3 (PDF 32-483, space group: Pc1),33 confirming that the pure LaF3 phase was successfully formed by the modified synthetic method used in this work. The diffraction peaks of the NPLaFEu sample are broader than the bulkLaFEu sample due to the small size of the synthesized nanoparticles. In fact, the XRD patterns of Eu(III)-doped NPLaFEu and bulkLaFEu samples (Fig. 1) have a small displacement of the diffraction peaks indicating some distortion in the LaF3 network due to the high concentration (15 mol%) of Eu(III) ions in doped-samples. The XRD patterns of the NPLaFErYb and bulkLaFErYb co-doped samples (ESI,† Fig. S4) show similar diffraction profiles. It is known that in LaF3 the La(III) ion occupies a crystallographic site with C2 symmetry, which was confirmed by powder neutron diffraction34 and Raman spectroscopy35 of pure LaF3. By monocrystal X-ray diffraction studies of pure and Ln(III)-doped LaF3, Carnall et al.36 concluded that the La(III) C2 local symmetry may be distorted to C2v or even D3h symmetries by the substitution of La(III) by other Ln(III) ions.

Raman scattering spectra of the NPLaFEu, bulkLaFEu and bulkLaF samples (Fig. 2) illustrate the distortion of LaF3 phonon modes by Eu(III)-doping. The modes at 365 cm−1 and 390 cm−1 are observed for all samples and attributed to Eg and A1g modes of the La–F bond,35 respectively. The variation of the relative intensity between the Eg and A1g modes for bulkLaFEu and NPLaFEu samples when compared to the non-doped bulkLaF results from network distortion due to Eu(III) doping in the LaF3 matrix. The Raman spectra of the NPLaFErYb and bulk LaFErYb samples (ESI,† Fig. S5) have a different spectral profile, indicating a different network distortion of LaF3 when co-doped with Er(III)/Yb(III) ions. It is important to mention that no evidence of LaOF formation was detected by Raman spectroscopy.

The low temperature synthesis and the use of oleylamine as a stabilizing agent resulted in small sized LaF3 nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 3) images show crystalline nanoparticles with a 6 nm mean size. The distance between crystallographic planes was measured and could be attributed to the hexagonal LaF3 planes (−120) with an interplanar distance of 3.59 Å. Based on the counting of 180 nanoparticles, the nanoparticle size distribution follows a normal distribution with 95% of confidence.

In the excitation spectra of the NPLaFEu sample (Fig. 4a) two intense and broad bands are observed at around 275 and 350 nm. These bands are also observed in the UV-Vis spectra of the NPLaFEu sample (ESI,† Fig. S6). The excitation band at around 275 nm could be attributed to the π–π* transitions of the oleylamine molecular orbital37 and the one at around 350 nm to the N–Eu(III) charge transfer band (CTB), respectively. Nag et al.38 also observed the N–Eu(III) CTB at around 340 nm for the Eu[N(CN)2]3·2H2O complex. N–Eu(III) CTB is expected to have lower energy compared to F–Eu(III) (below 200 nm in LaF3:Eu(III)) and Eu(III)–O near 290 nm in La2O3:Eu(III) charge transfer bands, due to the decrease in the electronegativity from F > O > N.39 The presence of the N–Eu(III) CTB in the NPLaFEu excitation spectra is an evidence of the NH2 group from oleylamine molecules and its interaction with Eu(III) ions on the nanoparticle surface. The Eu(III) intraconfigurational 4f → 4f transitions are also observed, but at a lower intensity than the previous ones, because they are forbidden according to the Laporte and spin selection rules. The emission spectra were recorded under 396 and 275 nm excitation and the insets in Fig. 6b and c show the 5D0 → 7F0 transition obtained at 77 K.
 Fig. 4  Luminescence spectra of the NPLaFEu sample. (a) Excitation spectra, (b) and (c) emission spectra obtained at 396 and 275 nm excitation respectively. 
In the emission spectra upon excitation at 396 nm (5L6 ← 7F0 Eu(III) transition – Fig. 6b) one may observe a broad and weak emission band at around 480 nm attributed to oleylamine (probably S1 → S0) and the 5D0 → 7FJ intra-configurational transitions of Eu(III), while in emission spectra upon excitation at 275 nm (oleylamine π–π* transition) the emission band of oleylamine disappears and the profile of the 5D0 → 7FJ transitions are changed. The splitting of 5D0 → 7FJ transitions is different upon 396 or 275 nm excitation and the 5D0 → 7F1/5D0 → 7F2 ratio (R12) is lower at 275 nm excitation due to the higher intensity of 5D0 → 7F2 transition. These changes may suggest the excitation of Eu(III) ions in different chemical environments through the nanoparticles. Another way to analyze the chemical environment around the Eu(III) ions in a host matrix is to measure the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the 5D0 → 7F0 transition and their barycenter position. This transition is non-degenerated, and the presence of more than one component or the broadening of this emission band are evidences that the Eu(III) ions are located at more than one or at several slightly distorted symmetry sites, respectively.40 In the insets of Fig. 4b and c only one component is observed for 5D0 → 7F0 transition in the NPLaFEu sample but the data in Table 1 show that the FWHM value of the 5D0 → 7F0 transition on this sample is larger than that on the bulkLaFEu, indicating that the Eu(III) ions are located at several slightly distorted similar symmetry sites in the nanoparticles. Changing the excitation wavelength from 396 to 275 nm, the FWHM of the 5D0 → 7F0 transition increases probably due to the excitation of Eu(III) ions in different locations over the nanoparticles. The position of 5D0 → 7F0 transition can be related to the nephelauxetic effect (covalence degree) of the Eu–F chemical bond.41–43 Observing the last column of Table 1, the NPLaFEu sample have the barycenter value less energetic than the bulkLaFEu sample, showing that at the nanoparticles, the Eu–F bond has a lower ionic character than the one at the bulkLaFEu. The changes in the covalency from bulkLaFEu to NPLaFEu may be attributed to the presence of oleylamine molecules at the surface, which contribute to the change in the chemical environment around the Eu(III) ions near these molecules.

The time resolved emission spectra of the NPLaFEu sample under 396 nm excitation (Fig. 5) shows that after 0.10 ms the emission band that centered at 480 nm and attributed to the oleylamine S1 → S0 emission vanishes due to the short emission lifetime (spin allowed transition). In contrast, the 5D0 → 7FJ Eu(III) emission bands from 575 to 720 nm have longer emission lifetimes (spin and parity forbidden transitions). For a better comprehension in detail the emission spectra obtained after 0.25 ms is shown in Fig. 5 and it is possible to verify the disappearance of the Eu(III) emission and the variation of the asymmetric ratio (R12) between the 5D0 → 7F1 and 5D0 → 7F2 transitions over time. This variation (ESI,† Fig. S7) can be explained as follows: the Eu(III) ions at the nanoparticle surface are located in chemical environments that may possess several symmetry distortions compared to those founded in the bulk one. The Eu(III) ions at this location are expected to have 5D0 → 7F2 transition with higher intensity, as observed in the inset of Fig. 5. On the other side, the Eu(III) ions located on the bulk probably have a less distorted symmetric environment compared to the ones at the surface and are expected to have the 5D0 → 7F2 transition with lower intensity, as it is observed after 0.85 ms. The hypothesis of more than one chemical environment for the Eu(III) ions in the nanoparticles is confirmed by the emission decay curves. The 5D0 emission decay curve (Fig. 6) can be adjusted by a third order exponential decay function for both excitation wavelengths (396 and 275 nm). The shortest lifetime values may be attributed to the Eu(III) ions near the surface of the nanoparticles. As shown in FT-IR and excitation spectra analysis, the Eu(III) ions located near the surface are interacting with oleylamine molecules. The vibrational modes of the organic structure contribute to the increase of the non-radiative emission rate and therefore the decrease of the emission lifetime values of Eu(III) ions at this location. The other two lifetime values are attributed to the Eu(III) ions from the interior of the nanoparticles that are shielded from the influence of the oleylamine molecules. The lifetime value of the Eu(III) ions located at the nanoparticle core is very close to the one found for the bulkLaFEu sample (8.57 ms – ESI,† Fig. S8). Jansesns et al.44 used a similar model to explain the differences in the emission spectra profile and also of the lifetime values of thenoyltrifluoracetone (tta)-caped LaF3:Eu(III) nanoparticles: the authors observed that the distorted symmetry and interaction with the tta ligand at the surface makes the intensity of 5D0 → 7F2 transition higher for the Eu(III) ions located at the surface than the ones located inside the nanoparticles.

Observing the quantum efficiency (η) values shown in Table 2 one may observe that the NPLaFEu sample at both excitation wavelengths has lower η than the bulkLaFEu sample. The presence of non-radiative decay routes from oleylamine molecule vibrations at the nanoparticle surface lowers the emission lifetime values for this sample, resulting in lower η values.

The Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters Ω2 and Ω4 are largely used to obtain information regarding the Eu(III) ion chemical environment in compounds of several types and can also be used in inorganic host matrices.5,45 From the emission spectra at room temperature and the mean emission lifetime value these intensity parameters were obtained as described elsewhere5 and the data are given in Table 3, where the Ω2 and Ω4 parameters obtained for bulkLaFEu were added for comparison.

Comparing bulkLaFEu and NPLaFEu samples under 396 nm excitation, one may note that Ω2 and Ω4 parameters are higher for the nanoparticles than for the bulk sample, due to the presence of more than one chemical environment for the Eu(III) ions at the nanoparticles: one at the “core” and the other one at the surface, as discussed previously. The ones located at the nanoparticle surface have distortions at the symmetry around Eu(III) ions. It is known that the 5D0 → 7F2 transition is hypersensitive, so it increases the intensity even by small changes in the Eu(III) ion symmetry towards low symmetries. As the Ω2 parameter is obtained from the integrated area of this transition, alterations in the transition intensity will be reflected in the Ω2 parameter value. This way, the presence of Eu(III) ions at distorted sites of the nanoparticle surface results in a slightly higher Ω2 value for the NPLaFEu than for the bulk sample. In ref. 46 it has been demonstrated that the Ω4 parameter is also affected by changes in the symmetry around the Eu(III) ion, and it can be observed that this parameter is also higher for the NPLaFEu sample than for the bulkLaFEu. Comparing the NPLaFEu sample under different excitation wavelengths it is possible to notice that when the excitation is at 275 nm, both Ω2 and Ω4 parameters are much higher than the ones for the bulk sample and for the excitation at 396 nm. The Ω2 parameter seems to be more affected, suggesting the Eu(III) ions at the nanoparticle surface, where the symmetry distortions are higher than those in the “core”, may be preferentially excited at 275 nm.
The Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped nanoparticle samples were also prepared and as it can be observed from the NIR emission spectra (Fig. 7), there is no significant difference in the emission profile between the different Er(III)/Yb(III) molar proportions in NPLaFErYb11, NPLaFErYb12 and NPLaFErYb13 samples. The broad emission centered at 1540 nm indicates a possible application of the nanoparticles in materials for optical amplification in the 1550 nm region.
 Fig. 7  NIR emission spectra of the NPLaFErYb11, NPLaFErYb12 and NPLaFErYb13 samples under 980 nm excitation. 
The emission decay curves obtained for the Er(III) ion in LaF3 nanoparticles were adjusted to a first order exponential decay function (Fig. 8). The sample with the higher Er(III) concentration (NPLaFErYb11) has the lowest emission lifetime value (0.57 ms), due to Er(III)–Er(III) cross relaxation that seems to be more important in this sample. The lowering of Er(III) emission lifetime from the NPLaFErYb12 to the NPLaFErYb13 sample in spite of the lower Er(III) concentration in the latter suggests that it is not only the Er(III)–Er(III) cross relaxation that influences the Er(III) emission decay lifetime value. However, the variation in the Er(III)/Yb(III) molar ratio was made aiming at the synthesis of samples with high emission decay lifetime values at the Er(III) 4I13/2 level, because it allows the required population inversion necessary for the amplification application of the materials. Usually, to achieve high emission lifetimes in luminescent nanoparticles the core@shell approach is used. In the present work, the high emission lifetime value (1.62 ms) was achieved for the NPLaFErYb12 sample using the proposed modified methodology. For Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped LaF3 nanoparticles, Stowdam et al.17 have found the lifetime value of 0.2 ms at the Er(III) 4I13/2 level. Bo et al.50 studied a core LaF3:Er(III)/Yb(III) and core@shell LaF3:Er(III)/Yb(III)@LaF3 nanoparticles and obtained the lifetime values of 0.060 ms and 0.090 ms, respectively. The latter authors have prepared planar waveguides using Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped LaF3 nanoparticles and measured 3.5 dB of gain at 1550 nm for the device. In the present work, the sample NPLaFErYb12 has higher emission lifetime at 1540 nm and therefore it is a promising system for erbium-doped waveguide amplifiers.
 Fig. 8  NIR emission decay curves of the Er(III) 4I13/2 metastable state of NPLaFErYb samples. 
All Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped samples present the Er(III) upconversion (UC) transitions in green (2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2) and red regions (4F9/2→4I15/2) upon 980 nm excitation (Fig. 9). The NPLaFErYb11 sample has the lower intensity of the green emission compared to the other ones, due to the high Er(III) content that quenches this transition through the ion–ion energy transfer. Regarding the upconversion mechanism, the angular coefficient (n) of the power dependence graphic (Fig. 9b, d, f) is denominated as the number of absorbed low energy photons for each higher energy photon that is emitted.24,25 The sample with the higher Er(III) content (NPLaFErYb11) has a non-linear power dependence. A similar profile was observed by Sivakumar et al.47 for Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped LaF3 samples. However, they found the “n” value of 6 in intermediate laser power values and attributed it to a multi-photon dependent mechanism. The NPLaFErYb11 sample has an “n” value of 2.56 for the 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 transition and 2.78 for the 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transition. In the literature47–49 usually the “n” value varying from 1.5 to 2.4 as near 2.0 is used, for Er(III)/Yb(III) upconversion materials both for red and green emission. In the present systems it is reasonable to assume the “n” value for NPLaFErYb11 as 2.5, for red and green emission in the following upconversion mechanism (Fig. 10).

 Fig. 10  Red (a) and green (b) upconversion mechanisms for the NPLaFErYb11 sample with an “n” value of 2.5. 
As shown in Fig. 10a initially, 3 photons are transferred from Yb(III) to Er(III)(A), which are excited to 4F5/2 and 4F3/2 levels, and through non-radiative decay 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 levels are populated. Another 2 photons are transferred from Yb(III) to Er(III)(B), which are excited to the 4F9/2 level and through non-radiative decay the 4I9/2 level is populated. As the Er(III) concentration is high, a cross relaxation between Er(III)(A) and Er(III)(B) may occur resulting in both ions in the 4F9/2 state from where the emission of two photons in the red region occurs. In the proposed mechanism, the red upconversion emission occurs after the absorption of 5 photons in the infrared region followed by emission of 2 photons in the visible region, resulting in the “n” value of 2.5. The proposed mechanism for the green emission, described in Fig. 10b, has the same initial step as the proposed mechanism for the red emission, with the transference of 3 photons from the Yb(III) to Er(III)(A), which are excited to 4F5/2 and 4F3/2 levels. In addition, 2 photons can be transferred to the Er(III)(B) ion, which are excited to the 4F9/2 level and through non-radiative decay the 4I9/2 level is populated. Through cross relaxation the levels 2H11/2 and 2S3/2 of both Er(III)(A) and Er(III)(B) ions are populated, resulting in the emission of 2 photons in the green region. The global process involves the absorption of 5 photons in the infrared region and emission of 2 photons in the visible range. For the other Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped LaF3 samples, the “n” value is close to 2 with the absorption of 2 photons in the infrared region followed by the emission of 1 photon in the visible range (ESI,† Fig. S9).
Polydimethylsiloxane (pdms) containing oleylamine stabilized RE(III)-doped LaF3 nanoparticles
From the FT-IR investigations of the nanoparticle(NP)-containing pdms samples (ESI,† Fig. S10) it was possible to conclude that the synthesized membranes are completely crosslinked, once there were no bands assigned to Si-H stretching on the infrared spectra, indicating that the hydrosilylation reaction was complete. Besides that, the nanoparticles are well dispersed, as indicated in the photograph of the MtvsNP sample illuminated under white and UV light (ESI,† Fig. S11a and b, respectively). The UV-Vis spectra of the NP-containing pdms membranes (ESI,† Fig. S12) indicate that the samples are transparent in the visible range but have some absorption in the NIR range, due to the presence of C–H groups of the pdms. The thermogravimetric curves of these pdms samples (ESI,† Fig. S13) indicate that they are thermally stable up to 400 °C. The TEM image (Fig. 11) shows the Eu(III)-doped LaF3 nanoparticles dispersed in the pdms matrix.
 Fig. 11  Transmission electron micrograph of the NPLaFEu-containing pdms sample MtvsNP. 
The refractive index value of the NP-containing pdms samples is increased as the amount of dvb cross linker is increased (Table 4), showing that it is possible to control the refractive index of the material by adjusting the dvb amount, which is important for the preparation of waveguides. The refractive indices of silica in optical fibers are 1.4445 at 1535 nm, so it would be desirable that the refractive indices of the prepared membranes and future waveguides were near to that value, in order to avoid signal losses during fiber coupling with a waveguide.

After analyzing the luminescence spectra of the Eu(III)-doped NP-containing pdms samples, it can be noted from the excitation spectra (Fig. 12a) that the 5L6 ← 7F0 and 5D2 ← 7F0 transitions at 396 nm and 464 nm, respectively, are observed, but at a lower intensity compared to the band at around 325 nm that is probably attributed to the (π–π*) emission band of dvb molecules. It can also be noted that the absorption band that was observed in the UV-Vis spectra (ESI,† Fig. S14) with a maximum at around 250 nm is also observed in the excitation spectra.37
 Fig. 12  Luminescence spectra of the pdms membranes containing NPLaFEu. Excitation spectra (a) and emission spectra (b, c) at different excitation wavelengths as indicated in the figure. 
The emission spectra of the NP-containing membranes obtained upon excitation at 396 nm have similar profiles (Fig. 12b) where the Eu(III) transitions from 5D0 to 7FJ are observed. Besides those transitions, there is also a broad emission band centered near 460 nm, which is also present in the emission spectra of the isolated nanoparticles (Fig. 4b) and was attributed to the oleylamine emission. In the NP-containing pdms membranes, this emission may be a combination of the oleylamine and the cross-linker emission, as its intensity increases as a function of the dvb amount (Fig. 12b). When the excitation wavelength is changed from 396 to 275, 330 or 293 nm (Fig. 12c), the profile of the emission spectra is modified due to the presence of different chemical environments for the Eu(III) ions in the dispersed nanoparticles, similar to what was already observed for the isolated nanoparticle sample (Fig. 4). The emission spectral profile of the dispersed nanoparticles (Fig. 12) is very similar to the isolated ones (Fig. 4), showing that the passivation of the surface by the oleylamine molecules preserved the local symmetry around the Eu(III) ions at the nanoparticle surface (Table 5).

Comparing with the emission lifetime values of the NPLaFEu sample (Fig. 6), it is observed that after nanoparticle dispersion in pdms membranes, the Eu(III) emission lifetime values were lowered (Fig. 13). The oleylamine molecules have interaction with the CH3 lateral chain of the pdms matrix, which makes possible for the NPs to remain dispersed in the pdms matrix. However, this interaction increases the non-radiative decay by increasing the C–H vibrations near the Eu(III) ions at the nanoparticle surface. The consequence is that the mean lifetime and the quantum efficiency values were also lowered after dispersion (Tables 5 and 6).

Comparing the Judd–Ofelt Ω2 and Ω4 intensity parameters for the NPLaFEu (Table 3) and for the NP-containing pdms membranes (Table 6) obtained from the emission spectra at λexc = 396 nm, it can be noted that there is no significant change in its value, suggesting that the chemical environment of europium(III) ions is not changing. Comparing Ω2 and Ω4 values between the membrane samples with different cross-linker molecules, and those obtained from the spectra at different λexc it is observed that there is also no significant changes in the values, showing once more that the oleylamine molecules are to some degree passivating the nanoparticle surface. The interactions of the oleylamine molecules with the rigid crosslinked pdms network avoid relevant emission intensity fluctuations due to symmetry changes.
The membrane composition that has the higher refractive index (proportion tvs:dvb 1:2) was the one used to disperse the NPLaFErYb11, NPLaFErYb12 and NPLaFErYb13. It can be observed from the UV-Vis transmittance spectra (ESI,† Fig. S12) of the resulting membranes that there is absorption in the NIR region, at around 1540 nm. This absorption can be attributed to the O–H stretching overtone due to the presence of an impurity in the dvb crosslinker (4-tert-butyl-catechol). In spite of this absorption, the Er(III) emission at 1540 nm was easily observed.
The broad Er(III) emission band centered at around 1540 nm (Fig. 14) is attributed to the 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition of the Er(III) ion. The FWHM of the emission band is practically invariable and similar to the ones obtained for the isolated nanoparticles (Fig. 7), showing that the Er(III) ions at the nanoparticles keep their emission profile after dispersion in pdms. However, the Stark splitting of the dispersed nanoparticles is lower than the ones of isolated nanoparticles due to the larger slit that was used to record the membrane spectra, since the amount of dispersed NPs is very low, resulting in the weak intensity of Er(III) emission. The sample with the higher amount of Yb(III) ions is the one with the higher emission intensity, indicating that there is an efficient absorption under 980 nm radiation by the Yb(III) ions followed by an efficient non-radiative energy transfer to the Er(III) ion.

Conclusions
In this work, oleylamine stabilized core-only lanthanide-doped LaF3 nanoparticles were prepared and their luminescence properties were studied. The oleylamine molecules remain at the nanoparticle surface even after washing the samples with ethanol and also after a thermal treatment at 280 °C for 12 h under the nitrogen atmosphere to eliminate the excess of oleylamine. TEM analysis shows that the nanoparticles have a mean size of 6 nm indicating that the oleylamine molecules controlled the nanoparticle size successfully. The luminescence spectroscopy data suggest that the profile of the emission spectra is different depending on the excitation wavelength used and the Judd–Ofelt intensity parameters are also changed. The time resolved luminescence spectra and lifetime measurements indicate the presence of two different chemical environments for the Eu(III) ions on the nanoparticles. The Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped oleylamine stabilized LaF3 nanoparticles presented a broad emission band at 1540 nm with a lifetime value higher than the ones reported in the literature for the same host matrix with the same Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doping ratio. It is important to note that this was achieved without the need for the core@shell approach that is the usual solution to the enhancement of the emission lifetime in lanthanide-doped nanoparticles. The Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped nanoparticles showed red and green upconversion emission and for the nanoparticles doped with Er(III)/Yb(III) 1:1 a new mechanism for the red and green upconversion emission was proposed with an n value of 2.5.
The nanoparticles were dispersed in pdms that was linked with three different cross-linkers through the hydrosilylation reaction, with the aim to obtain the one with a higher refractive index, for future applications in planar waveguide amplifiers. The resulting membranes were transparent in the visible range indicating that the nanoparticles were well dispersed on the material. TGA analysis shows that the membranes are thermally stable up to almost 400 °C and the UV-Vis spectra show that the membranes are transparent in the visible range but show some absorption in the UV and NIR region. The luminescence spectroscopy of the Eu(III)-doped dispersed nanoparticles shows that dispersion does not promote the broadening of the Eu(III) emission bands. The membranes containing the Er(III)/Yb(III) co-doped nanoparticles were obtained using only one cross-link: tvs:dvb 1:2, which was the one with a higher refractive index. These membranes presented the emission centered at around 1540 nm with the same FWHM than the isolated nanoparticles, indicating that the dispersion of the nanoparticles at the pdms matrix did not have influence on this parameter. The lanthanide(III)-doped LaF3 nanoparticle dispersion at the polydimethylsiloxane was achieved and it was demonstrated that even after dispersion, the nanoparticles show reasonable luminescence intensity, emission lifetime and quantum efficiency. In addition to thermal stability, these optical properties will be useful in the near future. The resulting hybrid materials or even photopolymerizable derivates would be manufactured using an etching-free process for the preparation of planar or flexible erbium-doped planar waveguides with refractive indices compatible with the silica optical fibers.
