    , Accepted 1st June 2021First published on 2nd June 2021AbstractThe power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs) based on non-fullerene acceptors are still limited by large energy loss (ΔEloss). Herein, we report an easy and feasible way to reduce the ΔEloss, specifically the energy losses caused by non-radiative recombination of OSCs via introducing 3,4-dicyanothiophene (DCT), a structurally simple building block with strong electron-withdrawing ability, into a state-of-the-art donor polymer PBDB-TF to form ternary copolymers. The effects of DCT content in the ternary copolymers on the optical properties, energy levels, film morphology, charge transport, photovoltaic performance, and energy losses are studied comprehensively. Significant efficiency improvement in OSCs has been achieved by the DCT-based ternary copolymers as compared to the benchmark polymer PBDB-TF mainly because of a higher open-circuit voltage enabled by the reduced non-radiative recombination energy loss. A high PCE of 16.6% and a low non-radiative recombination energy loss (0.22 eV) were achieved in ternary OSCs with the DCT-based terpolymer as the electron donor and Y6-BO and PC71BM as the electron acceptors.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention due to their light-weight, flexibility, semitransparency, and prospect in building-integrated photovoltaics.1–4 The emergence of small molecular non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs),5–8 the development of donor materials,9–13 and the progresses in device optimization14–16 and device physics studies17–20 contributed to the rapid increase of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs. To date, the highest PCE of single-junction OSCs has exceeded 18%.10,21,22 But the PCE of OSCs still lags behind crystalline silicon and perovskite solar cells.23 One of the main reasons is the relatively large energy loss (ΔEloss) in OSCs.24–27 The ΔEloss consists of three parts: radiative loss above bandgap ΔE1, radiative loss below bandgap ΔE2, and nonradiative loss ΔE3. The value of ΔE1 depends on the bandgap and varies between 0.25 and 0.30 eV.28 ΔE2 can be as low as 50 meV in OSCs with negligible energetic offsets,29 which is comparable to crystalline silicon and perovskite solar cells.30 However, the ΔE3 is typically much larger than 0.2 eV in OSCs,31–33 which is larger than that of crystalline silicon and perovskite solar cells (where ΔE3 can be lower than 0.1 eV).34,35 Hence, it is vital to suppress the non-radiation recombination to reduce the overall ΔEloss.
The non-radiative recombination loss ΔE3 can be calculated from ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL), where k is Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Therefore, reducing the non-radiative recombination energy loss of an OSC means increasing the external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence (EQEEL). The low EQEEL in OSCs can be assigned to the existence of the interfacial CT state, formed at the interface between the donor and acceptor in the active layer.24,25 Smaller ΔVnon-radoc is usually found in materials systems with higher charge transfer state (ECT).24,25,36 Therefore, it is necessary to upshift the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of electron acceptors and/or downshift the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of electron donors.31–33,37,38 For example, Hou et al. developed a non-fullerene acceptor ITCCM-O with a wide bandgap of 2.0 eV.39 The LUMO–LUMO offset between the polymer donor J52 and the acceptor ITCCM-O is only 0.09 eV, which enabled a remarkable high Voc (1.34 V) and a very low ΔE3 (0.22 eV). However, the absorption spectra will be blue-shifted when the LUMO levels of electron acceptors are elevated, which will cause reduced short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the resulting OSCs. Therefore, a more feasible strategy is to downshift the HOMO level of electron donors. It has been reported that efficient exciton dissociation can occur at extremely small energy-level offsets, which leave sufficiently large room for energy level control to reduce Eloss of OSCs.40–43
Polymer donors for high-efficiency OSCs are mainly copolymers based on benzo-[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and various acceptor units. Electron-withdrawing substituents such as fluorine (F) atom,44,45 chlorine (Cl) atom,46 and ester groups47 are usually introduced to these polymers in pursuit of a deep-lying HOMO level and high open-circuit voltage (Voc). Specifically, F atom is most widely used to modulate the energy levels of polymer donors (Scheme 1). For example, Xue et al. simultaneously fluorinated thiophene rings in the π-bridge and side chains to synthesize polymer J91 with low HOMO energy level.44 The OSCs based on J91:m-ITIC blend film showed a high Voc of 0.984 V, which was 0.284 V higher than that of the non-fluorinated counterpart. Besides, F atom was used synergistically with other electron-withdrawing substituents, such as ester group,47 to downshift the energy levels of polymer donors. A high efficiency of 17.3% was achieved based on a highly fluorinated polymer donor PTzBI-dF with a low ΔE3 of 0.21 V.45 However, fluorination will increase the complexity of synthesis and require the use of high-risk reagents. Therefore, it is of critical importance to design new polymer donors with deep-lying HOMO levels and high device performance via facile synthesis for application in OSCs. This point was also highlighted by a recent work of Hou's group, where suitable energy levels and high device performance were obtained by an easily synthesized poly(thiophene vinylene) derivative with ester group substitution.48
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of representative polymer donors with deep-lying HOMO levels. 
Recently, we demonstrated that 3,4-dicyanothiophene (DCT) is a promising electron-deficient building block with structural simplicity and synthetic accessibility.49 The DCT-based polymers exhibited deep-lying HOMO level, and favorable face-on orientation and fibril-assembly in films.49,50 In addition, the large dipole moment caused by cyano-group can induce a higher relative dielectric constant, which may reduce the exciton binding energy and charge recombination losses.51,52 Herein, we introduced DCT unit into the benchmark polymer benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-alt-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (PBDB-TF)53 as the third comonomer to form a set of random ternary copolymers for application in OSCs. The DCT-based ternary copolymers showed gradually down-shifted HOMO levels with the increase of DCT content as compared to PBDB-TF. When blended with the non-fullerene acceptor Y6-BO,54 the terpolymer PFBCNT20 yielded a high PCE of 16.3% due to the enhanced Voc and lower non-radiative recombination energy loss (0.23 eV). A further enhanced PCE of 16.6% was achieved by the ternary OSC of PFBCNT20:Y6-BO:PC71BM with a smaller non-radiation energy loss of 0.22 eV. These results show that the introduction of DCT unit as the third comonomer is an easy and effective strategy to develop high-performance polymer donors with reduced energy loss and increased Voc for OSCs.
Results and discussion
Polymer synthesis
The synthesis route of the polymers was exhibited in Scheme 2. Detailed procedures for the synthesis of monomer 3 and the polymers can be found in the ESI.† The synthesis of monomer 3 started from precursor 1, which was obtained following previously reported procedures.49 The compound 2 can be achieved by Stille coupling between the precursor 1 and 2-(tri-n-butylstannyl)-4-dodecylthiophene. Then bromination on compound 2 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) generated the monomer 3. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of molecules 2 and 3 were shown in Fig. S1–S4.† The polymers were obtained via Stille polymerization. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and molar-mass dispersity (ĐM = Mw/Mn) of the polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 140 °C. The results are shown in Table 1. It is worth mentioning that the molecular weights of the DCT-containing random copolymers are comparable to the reference polymer PBDB-TF, which can mitigate the impact of molecular weight on the device performance.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The normalized UV-Vis absorption spectra of PBDB-TF and PFBCNTx in chlorobenzene solution and thin films were shown in Fig. S5a† and 1b, respectively. The relevant numerical data was listed in Table 1. From solution to solid state, the absorption spectra of all the polymers slightly red-shifted. Similar optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.83 eV were calculated from the onsets of the absorption spectra in films. The films of the polymers show strong absorption in the range of 400–700 nm, which form a good complementary absorption with the acceptor Y6-BO. The temperature dependent absorption spectra of the copolymers in diluted chlorobenzene solution were also recorded (Fig. S6†) to investigate the effect of DCT on the aggregation characteristics of the polymers. The reference polymer PBDB-TF and the three DCT-containing polymers showed similar temperature-dependent aggregation behavior. The strong vibronic 0–0 peak (λ0–0) was gradually weakened when the solution temperature increased from room temperature to 95 °C, but the polymers are not completely unfolded even at 95 °C.

The HOMO levels of the polymers and the LUMO level of Y6-BO were measured by square wave voltammetry (SWV) from the onsets of the redox waves. The energy levels are reported relative to the energy level of ferrocene (Fc/Fc+) of −5.13 eV versus vacuum.55 The LUMO levels of the polymers and the HOMO level of Y6-BO were estimated using the Eoptg. The relevant results were described in Fig. 1c and S5b (ESI†). Their numerical data was summarized in Table 1. The HOMO/LUMO level of PBDB-TF is −5.48/−3.65 eV. Compared to the reference polymer PBDB-TF, the HOMO energy levels of PFBCNTx were down-shifted gradually upon increasing DCT content, which is −5.49 eV for PFBCNT10, −5.50 eV for PFBCNT20, and −5.53 eV for PFBCNT30, respectively. The LUMO energy levels of PFBCNTx were also down-shifted with the increase of DCT content. The down-shifted energy levels were caused by the strong electron-withdrawing ability of cyano-group in DCT.49 The energy levels of these polymers match well with the acceptor Y6-BO (HOMO/LUMO = −5.79/−4.10 eV). Thus, higher Voc and lower Eloss are expectable in the resulting OSCs for the DCT-based polymers with respect to PBDB-TF.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of the polymers were studied with a device architecture of glass/indium tin oxide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PFBCNTx:Y6-BO/PDINO/Al, where PDINO is a perylene diimide derivative-functionalized amino N-oxide.56 Device optimization was conducted in terms of the active layer thickness, polymers:Y6-BO weight ratio, solvent additive, thermal annealing at different temperatures, types of the electron transport layer and cathode. The photovoltaic parameters under various conditions are shown in Fig. S7, S8 and Tables S1–S7.† The optimized devices for all polymers were obtained with chloroform as the host solvent, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the additive, and thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 minutes. The optimal electron transport material was PDINO, and the cathode was Al electrode. As exhibited in Fig. 2a and Table 2, the optimal PBDB-TF:Y6-BO device showed a PCE of 15.7% with a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 26.0 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.745. In contrast, the PFBCNT10:Y6-BO device showed a lower PCE of 14.9% with a reduced Jsc (25.7 mA cm−2) and FF (0.710), but a slightly enhanced Voc (0.82 V). The champion cell is achieved by PFBCNT20, which exhibited a PCE of 16.3% with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 26.3 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.739. When the content of DCT is further increased to 30%, the performance of the PFBCNT30:Y6-BO device dropped to 13.9% due to the simultaneously reduced Jsc and FF values (23.9 mA cm−2 and 0.685, respectively). It is noticed that the Voc increases with the increased content of DCT, which is consistent with the HOMO levels of the polymers. The main reason for the increased Voc could be assigned to the suppressed non-radiative energy loss, which will be discussed later. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the optimized devices were shown in Fig. 2b. Due to the similar optical bandgap, all devices display a similar photo-response in the region from 300 to 950 nm. The OSCs based on PBDB-TF, PFBCNT10, and PFBCNT20 exhibited comparably high EQEs, consistent with the similar Jsc of the OSCs. These results evidenced that efficient charge generation can been maintained upon decreasing energy loss. The EQEs of the PFBCNT30-based solar cell is considerably lower than those of the other devices, which might be caused by the inferior morphological characteristics. To further improve the device performance, we introduced PC71BM as the third component to the PFBCNT20:Y6-BO binary blend. The results are shown in Table S8,†Fig. 2, and Table 2. A higher PCE of 16.6% was successfully achieved by the PFBCNT20:Y6-BO:PC71BM (1:1:0.2) device owing to the enhancement of Voc (0.85 V) and Jsc (26.6 mA cm−2) with respect to the PFBCNT20:Y6-BO binary solar cell.

Blend morphology
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to investigate the effects of DCT on the blend morphological characteristics. As shown in Fig. S9,† the PBDB-TF:Y6-BO blend films exhibit uniform and smooth surface morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.98 nm. The RMS roughness increased slightly to ≈1.3 nm with the introduction of DCT into the polymer donors. Bicontinuous interpenetrating networks with fibrillar structures and proper domain size were formed in the blends based on different polymers, which is favorable for efficient charge generation and transport.57 These results suggest that the introduction of DCT unit does not influence the phase separation behavior of the donor:acceptor blends.
Therefore, the packing structures of the polymers in both neat films and donor:acceptor active layers were studied by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to understand the different Jsc and FF of the OSCs. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the PBDB-TF and PFBCNTx neat films demonstrate a preferential face-on orientation, which is beneficial for charge transport in the vertical direction. In blended films, the face-on orientation was retained for all the polymers (Fig. 3). The intensity of (010) diffraction in out-of-plane (OOP) direction increased from PBDB-TF to PFBCNT10 and PFBCNT20, which is consistent with the fact that the DCT unit can induce stronger interchain interaction and higher polymer crystallinity.49 However, further increasing the content of DCT unit led to lower (010) diffraction intensity for PFBCNT30, which can be ascribed to the reduced regioregularity of PFBCNT30. The PFBCNT20:Y6-BO blend shows the strongest (010) diffraction in OOP direction, indicating an improved face-on orientation as compared to the other blends. For a quantitative analysis, the pole figures of the (100) stacking peaks of blended films are shown in Fig. 3c. The PFBCNT20:Y6-BO blend shows the highest face-on/edge-on ratio (12.7) and the largest face-on fraction (44%). The improved face-on orientation of molecules is beneficial to OOP charge transport and device performance of OSCs. As a result, the OSC based on PFBCNT20:Y6-BO blend exhibited the high Jsc and FF.

Charge transport, recombination, and extraction characteristics
The photoluminescence (PL) quenching experiments were conducted to investigate the charge generation and transfer at the interfaces between donor and acceptor of OSCs. As shown in Fig. S11 and Table S11,† all the PFBCNTx:Y6-BO blends exhibited over 98% PL quenching efficiency, indicating the efficient charge transfer in the blend films. Among them, the PFBCNT20:Y6-BO blend displayed the highest PL quenching efficiency (99.2%), suggesting the most efficient photo-induced charge transfer at the donor:acceptor interfaces of PFBCNT20:Y6-BO blend. The photocurrent density (Jph) is plotted as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) for all optimized devices (Fig. 4a) to study the charge generation of the OSCs.58Jph is given by Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities tested under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Vappl, where V0 and Vappl are the voltage at Jph = 0 and applied bias voltage, respectively. For the PFBCNT20:Y6-BO device, Jph quickly saturated at a low Veff of 0.2–0.3 V. And the calculated exciton dissociation probability (P(E, T)) under the maximum power output condition are 90.3%, 87.0%, 95.2%, and 82.4% for the OSCs based on PBDB-TF, PFBCNT10, PFBCNT20, and PFBCNT30, respectively. These results further confirmed that the exciton dissociation and charge extraction are the most efficient in the PFBCNT20-based solar cell.

(b) Hole and electron mobilities of the polymer:Y6-BO blends acquired from single-carrier devices. (c) Voc as the function of Plight of the donor:acceptor binary OSCs based on PBDB-TF and PFBCNTx. 
The hole and electron mobilities of the neat polymers and polymer:Y6-BO blends were measured by fitting the data acquired from single-carrier devices to the space-charge limited-current model (Fig. S12–S14, and Tables S12–S14, ESI†).59 The neat film of PFBCNT20 exhibited a hole mobility of 2.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is the highest one among the four polymers (Table S12†). In blends the highest hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) were also achieved by the PFBCNT20:Y6-BO blend (Fig. 4b), which are 8.39 × 10−4 and 7.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The high and balanced charge transport characteristic (μe/μh = 0.88) in the PFBCNT20:Y6-BO blend could effectively reduce charge carrier recombination, and thus giving high FF for the resulting OSC.
Moreover, the relationships of Jsc and Voc as a function of the light intensity (Plight) were analyzed to investigate the recombination mechanisms of the OSCs.60–62 The Jsc as a function of light intensity (Plight) was plotted to investigate the bimolecular recombination. The relationship between Jsc and Plight can be described by Jsc ∝ (Plight)α, where α is the exponential factor. As shown in Fig. S15,† the α values of the optimized solar cells based on the four polymers are all close to unity, indicating negligible bimolecular recombination at short-circuit conditions in these devices. The correlation of Voc and Plight can be described by the formula Voc ∝ nkT/qln(Plight), where k, T, and q denote the Boltzmann constant, absolute temperature, and elementary charge, respectively.54 When the slope is close to kT/q, the bimolecular recombination is dominant. While the trap-assisted recombination or geminate recombination dominates when the slope is close to 2kT/q. As shown in Fig. 4c, the OSCs based on PBDB-TF, PFBCNT10, PFBCNT20, and PFBCNT30 exhibit a slope of 1.78kT/q, 1.51kT/q, 1.44kT/q, and 1.56kT/q, respectively. The lowest slope suggests that the trap-assisted recombination and geminate recombination can be most efficiently suppressed in the solar cell of PFBCNT20. Overall, these results show that the OSCs based on PFBCNT20:Y6-BO blend exhibited efficient charge generation, high and balanced charge transport, and efficient charge extraction.
Energy loss analysis
Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS) and external quantum efficiency of electroluminescence (EQEEL) measurements were used to analyze the ΔEloss of the OSCs in detail. The results are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 3. The optical bandgaps of the solar cells (EPVgs) were extracted from the EQE spectra, which were calculated to be 1.41 eV for all the devices. As discussed above, the total energy loss can be split into three terms: radiative recombination caused ΔE1 and ΔE2, and non-radiative recombination caused ΔE3. The OSCs based on PBDB-TF and PFBCNTx show the same ΔE1 (0.27 eV). The FTPS-EQE spectra of the PFBCNTx:Y6-BO solar cells exhibited almost identical onsets (Fig. 5a), thus leading to a low ΔE2 of 0.08 eV for all the devices. As discussed above, the ΔE3 is given by ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL). Therefore, the EQEEL spectra of the neat polymers and blend films were measured. As shown in Fig. S16,† the introduction of DCT has significantly enhanced the EQEEL of the polymers from 1.3 × 10−2% for PBDB-TF to 1.3 × 10−1% for PFBCNT30, implying that the DCT-containing polymers are more emissive and will have lower non-radiative recombination losses in the resulting OSCs. The EQEEL spectra of the blend films are shown in Fig. 5b and the numerical data are listed in Table 3. Similar enhancement of EQEEL was also observed. The PBDB-TF:Y6-BO-based device showed an EQEEL of 5.0 × 10−3%, while the PFBCNT30:Y6-BO-based device produced a much higher EQEEL of 1.5 × 10−2%. As a result, the lowest ΔE3 of 0.22 eV was found in PFBCNT30:Y6-BO-based device, which is lower than that of PBDB-TF:Y6-BO by 30 meV. Fig. 5c shows the comparison of radiative and nonradiative energy losses of the OSCs based on PBDB-TF and PFBCNTx. Clearly, the introduction of DCT unit into the polymer backbone has led to monotonically reduced ΔE3. And the reduced ΔE3 is the major reason for the lower ΔEloss and higher Voc of the resulting OSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, three random ternary copolymers were prepared with deeper HOMO levels by introducing DCT units into PBDB-TF. The non-radiative energy loss in solar cells were suppressed as a result of the down-shifted HOMO level of the polymer donors upon introducing DCT units. The solar cell with a higher PCE was achieved by PFBCNT20 as compared to the reference polymer PBDB-TF, which is mainly caused by the enhanced Voc, suppressed non-radiative energy loss, and improved face-on orientation. After introducing PC71BM as the third component, the ternary solar cell of PFBCNT20:Y6-BO:PC71BM yielded a high PCE of 16.6%. Our work proves that the introduction of DCT units into donor polymers is an easy and feasible strategy to improve device performance of OSCs via decreasing the non-radiative energy loss.
