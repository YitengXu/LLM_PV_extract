    , Accepted 13th February 2019First published on 14th February 2019AbstractWe report the synthesis and spectroscopic and electrochemical characterization of the benzyl, C4, C6, C8, C9, C10, and C18n-alkyl esters of double-caged fullerene compounds (dFR). Counterintuitively, their solubility depends nonmonotonically on the alkyl chain length with a minimum at n-octyl. The series of dFR compounds were tested in organic solar cells (OSCs) as an acceptor material blended with the poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) donor. With the exception of the n-octadecyl derivative, the performance of the P3HT/dFR solar cells correlates with the solubility of the dFR component, likely due to the improved bulk heterojunction morphology and its favorable effect on JSCvia lower series resistance. A peak PCE of 3.0% was found for the n-nonyl compound, thus exceeding other known fullerene oligomers with fused fullerene cages or cross-linked fullerene dimers. The poor performance of compounds with too long alkyl chains like n-octadecyl reflects larger series resistance that results from a higher degree of phase segregation.
Introduction
Fullerenes and extended non-fullerene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are regarded as prospective electron acceptor materials for fabrication of photoactive composites and organic solar cells (OSCs).1–8 Due to low dielectric constants of organic materials (εr 3.1–5.5),9,10 a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architecture of the OSCs and a sufficiently large energy offset (0.3 eV)11–13 between the acceptor and the donor are required to enable efficient charge separation and extraction. Some of the strategies to maximize the quantum efficiency of photoinduced charge separation and thus to enhance photocurrent consist in the design of molecular acceptors with increased electron mobility and delocalization.4,14 Indeed, larger conjugated π-electron systems obtained via dimerization of non-fullerene acceptor cores15–17 and fullerene cages18–26 provide better morphology, crystallinity and stability of organic and perovskite solar cells. Recently, we reported double-caged C60 fullerene derivatives dFR with advantageous crystallinity and light-harvesting properties26 where the two fullerene cages are tightly linked via a four-membered cycle and a pyrrolizidine bridge with an ester function CO2R (Scheme 1). In particular, the n-decyl ester dFDec demonstrated an electron mobility of (1.3 ± 0.4)·10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is comparable to that of the widely used phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester acceptor [PCBM, (1.4 ± 0.5)·10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1]. The P3HT/dFR OSCs with benzyl, n-decyl, and n-octadecyl ester moieties demonstrated power-conversion efficiencies of 1.9, 2.6, and 1.1%, respectively, evidencing the notable effect of the alkyl chain on the photovoltaic performance.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of double-caged fullerene derivatives dFR and yields (%) as isolated (toluene solution, 1 eq. C60, 1.2 eq. GlyOR·TsOH, 10 eq. paraformaldehyde, 2.4 eq. Et3N, 1.2 eq. LiClO4, reflux for 3 h). 
Here we report the synthesis and comparison of the spectral and electrochemical data for seven double-caged dFR esters in order to elucidate in more detail the effect of the alkyl moiety on the photovoltaic performance of P3HT/dFR solar cells (Scheme 1).
Experimental and methods
Materials and methods
HPLC purified fullerene C60 (Fullerene center, 99.98%) was used as the starting material for synthesis of fullerene acceptors. The PCBM fullerene derivative (HPLC purity 99.5%) used as a reference acceptor material in the control series of bulk heterojunction solar cells was synthesized according to the published literature.27 Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) donor polymer (P3HT) received from Rieke Metals Inc. (model no. 4002-EE, Mw = 57 kDa and Mw/Mn = 2.4) was used as the donor material. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS HTL Solar (Baytron P VP Al 4083) used as a hole transport layer was obtained from H.C. Starck. Solvents were dried by the usual methods and distilled before use. Unless otherwise specified, reagents were used as received without further purification.
HPLC analysis and separation of the samples were performed by means of an Agilent 1100 Series [diode array detector (DAD) operated at 190–950 nm wavelength range, Agilent Technologies, Inc.] and Breeze (UV-Vis λ2 detector operated at 190–700 nm, Waters, Inc.) LC systems. The LC systems were equipped with Cosmosil Buckyprep (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) HPLC analytic (4.6 mm I.D. × 25 cm and guardian column 4.6 mm I.D. × 5 cm) and semi-preparative (10 mm I.D. × 25 cm and guardian column 10 mm I.D. × 5 cm) columns with toluene as the eluent. HPLC traces were registered at 290 nm wavelength at room temperature (for analytical purposes column 4.6 mm I.D. × 25 cm was thermostated at 25 ± 0.8 °C). The absorption spectra of the samples in toluene solutions were recorded during the HPLC analysis via a DAD in the UV and visible range (190–950 nm) with 2 nm resolution.
The negative ion MALDI mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker AutoFlex II ref-TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a N2 laser (337 nm, 1 ns pulse). The 2-trans-[3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-2-propenylidene]malononitrile (DCTB, ≥99%, Fluka) was used as a matrix. High-resolution ESI mass spectra (positive ion mode) were recorded using an AB Sciex TripleTOF 5600+ instrument, DuoSpray ion source (ESI mode).

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance III spectrometer (600.3 and 150.9 MHz, respectively) for samples dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene-d4 with a small amount of tetramethylsilane (Me4Si, δH 0.00 ppm) as an internal standard.
Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out under oxygen-free and moisture-free (<1 ppm) argon atmosphere in an MBRAUN Labstar glove box. The CV curves were registered at 100 mV s−1 using an Elins Pi-50Pro-3 potentiostat at ambient (25–30 °C) temperature using a home-made one-compartment cell with a platinum disc working electrode (WE), a platinum coil counter electrode (CE), and an Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode (Ag wire immersed in a solution of 0.01 M AgNO3 and 0.1 M Bu4NBF4 in acetonitrile separated from the main compartment by a Vycor® plug; RE) in ortho-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) using 0.15 M Bu4NBF4 as the supporting electrolyte. oDCB was purified by distillation under reduced pressure in the presence of CaH2 followed by purging through a column containing dry SiO2 and activated molecular sieves (4 Å pore size) and stored in a glove box over anhydrous alumina. Bu4NBF4 (for electrochemical analysis, ≥99.0%, Fluka) was stored in a glove box and used as received. After each experiment, ferrocene was added to the cell as an internal standard. The potential of the Fc/Fc+ couple in oDCB was in the range of 0.225–0.255 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 couple. Potential iR drops were corrected during the experiment using a hardware positive feedback method. Electrochemistry-based (EC) energy levels of HOMO and LUMO were estimated from onsets of the oxidation and reduction peaks with reference to the Fc+/0 potential of −4.8 eV w.r.t. the vacuum level:28–30E(HOMO)EC = –e(Eox + 4.8) eV and E(LUMO)EC = −e(Eonsetred + 4.8) eV.
UV/Vis absorption spectra were recorded in toluene or oDCB solutions with the use of an AvaSpec-2048 spectrometer with optical resolution of 2.4 nm at RT. All spectra were registered using an AvaLight-Hal light source (360–2500 nm, stability ±1%). Optical band gaps (EoptG) were estimated from the absorption band onsets as EoptG = 1240/λonset.
Synthetic procedures
The glycine alkyl ester p-toluenesulfonates were prepared according to previous work31 (for further details and spectral data see the ESI†).

General procedure for synthesis of double-caged fullerene derivatives dFR. 
The double-caged fullerene derivatives dFR were prepared via lithium-salt assisted [2+3]-cycloaddition.26 Typically, triethylamine (46 μL, 0.34 mmol) was added to a suspension of glycine ester p-toluenesulfonate (0.34 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (2 mL). The obtained solution was added to fullerene C60 (200 mg, 0.28 mmol) dissolved in toluene (150 mL). Then paraformaldehyde (84 mg, 2.80 mmol), lithium perchlorate (36 mg, 0.34 mmol) and triethylamine (46 μL, 0.34 mmol) were added, and the mixture was refluxed for 3–5 h. The double-caged fullerene derivatives dFR were isolated by means of column chromatography (sequentially employing toluene/hexane 3:1 v/v mixture and then toluene). Finally, the products were purified using preparative scale HPLC and characterized by means of MS and NMR spectroscopy (see the ESI† for spectral details).

Device fabrication and measurements
The photovoltaic devices were fabricated on ITO-patterned glass substrates with nominal sheet resistance 15 Ω sq−1. The 23 × 23 × 1.1 mm3 glass substrates with a patterned ITO layer were purchased from Xinyan Technology Ltd. Initially, the substrates were consecutively washed with toluene, acetone and isopropanol. Then they were consecutively sonicated in detergent, deionized water, and isopropanol for 10 min at 70 °C, each sonication step being followed by rinsing with distillated water. Finally, the substrates were dried in an air stream and irradiated with a UV lamp (PL16-110, Sen Lights) for 15 min. A solution of PEDOT:PSS was filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE membrane and spin-coated on the cleaned substrates at 6000 rpm for 120 s using a G3-8 (Specialty Coating Systems) spin coater. The PEDOT:PSS films (∼30 nm thickness) were heated on a hot plate at 140 °C for 15 min.
Donor polymer P3HT and fullerene acceptor were jointly dissolved in oDCB (total concentration of 25 mg mL−1) in an argon-filled glove box and stirred on a magnetic stirrer for ca. 20 hours at 70 °C. The P3HT/acceptor weight ratio was 1.25:1 for PCBM-based reference cells and 2.5:1 for double-caged fullerene derivatives. The prepared solutions were filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE membrane and were spin-coated on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 700 rpm for 120 s.
The low work function cathode was made of calcium coated with aluminum. First, Ca film (20 nm) was deposited on the top of the active layer at a rate of 2–4 Å s−1 in a vacuum chamber (∼3 × 10−6 mbar) from a shutter-controlled resistive filament heater (tungsten wire) with the use of the Univex 350G system. That was immediately followed by deposition of Al film (80 nm) at a rate of 1–3 Å s−1. Using shadow masks, eight active circle-shaped areas (pixels) of 2.2 mm diameter were left on each substrate. After electrode deposition, photovoltaic characteristics were measured.
Thermal treatment of the as-cast devices was performed in an Ar-filled glove box on a hot plate at the temperature of 110 °C for 5 min before deposition of the top Ca/Al electrode. The P3HT/dFR and P3HT/PCBM (reference) devices were fabricated under similar conditions. For comparison purposes, the reference PCBM device was also fabricated using a pre-annealing protocol with annealing of the active layer at 160 °C for 5 min.3
The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under an Ar atmosphere with the use of a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 SourceMeter instrument under AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination from a 150 W solar simulator (model 96000, Newport) through a 2.0 mm diaphragm. Light intensity was controlled by a Thorlabs PM100D power meter with an S302C thermal power sensor. For each of the solar cells, photovoltaic parameters were averaged over its 8 pixels.
External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices were measured for pixels with the best PCE. The measurement protocol included the JSC measurement under monochromatic illumination with known intensity at different wavelengths in the range from 300 to 800 nm, and then the EQE was calculated as the ratio between the amount of photogenerated carriers at the electrodes and the number of incident photons.
Atomic-force microscopy (AFM) images were recorded using an NTEGRA Prima instrument (NT-MDT) in semi-contact (“tapping”) mode using NSG01 silicone cantilevers (150–230 kHz resonant frequencies, 3:1–5:1 aspect ratio, 10 nm tip typical curvature radius, 14–16 μm tip height). The scan rate was 5 ms per point, the resolution of each image was 500 × 500 points, size 5.0 × 5.0 μm2. Optical microscopy data were obtained by using an integrated optics (OPTEM Zoom 125) instrument. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on an FEI Nova NanoSEM 230 with a field emission source and adjustment of the accelerating voltage up to 30 kV with a precision step of 0.1 kV. All images were obtained at accelerating voltage 2 kV with different magnification from 75× to 120000×.
Contact angle measurements were performed using an FTA1000 Class B instrument (First Ten Ångstroms, Inc., USA). Solutions of P3HT and P3HT/dFR (2.5:1 w/w) in oDCB with total concentration of 25 mg mL−1 as well as the PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO-glass substrate were prepared as described above. Small drops (ca. 10 μL) of the solution were produced at room temperature on the horizontal PEDOT:PSS-coated substrate with the syringe pump, and their equilibrium profile (ca. after 1 s) was analyzed. The image was registered using a CCD camera with 640 × 480 resolution. The representative contact angle Θ was then taken as the mean of several determinations with typical error of ±5°.
Results and discussion
The series of seven double-caged fullerene derivatives with n-butyl, benzyl, n-hexyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, n-decyl, and n-octadecyl ester moieties (dFBu, dFBn, dFHex, dFOct, dFNon, dFDec, dFODec, including three novel compounds dFHex, dFOct, dFNon) were synthesized from C60, paraformaldehyde and glycine esters (see Scheme 1) via a single-stage lithium salt-assisted 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition approach26,32 with yields in the range of 40–49%. Isolation by column chromatography and additional purification by preparative HPLC provided spectroscopic purity of 98+%. The molecular composition of the dFR compounds has been verified by MALDI and high-resolution ESI mass spectrometry (Fig. S1 in the ESI†).
Spectroscopic data for the compounds dFBu, dFBn, dFDec, and dFODec are in good agreement with the previously reported data.26,32 Structural verification of the novel compounds dFHex, dFOct, and dFNon has been based on 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S2–S7 in the ESI†). The NMR data have confirmed the dynamically averaged Cs symmetry with two equivalent fullerene cages linked via rigid cyclobutane and carboxylated pyrrolizidine moieties.
UV-Vis absorption spectra of the dFR compounds in toluene are shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. S8 (ESI†). They are highly similar and show no significant effect of the varied alkyl moiety. The shoulder at 324 nm and the peak at 432 nm are characteristic features for the cis-1 addition pattern in C60.33–35 The double-caged molecular structure results in higher molar extinction compared to C60 and PCBM. As estimated from the absorption onsets, the optical bandgap values (EoptG) of the dFR compounds, PCBM and pristine C60 equal 740, 720, and 650 nm, respectively (1.68, 1.72, and 1.91 eV). Thus, the interactions of the two cages result in a slight closing of the band gap.

The electrochemical behavior of the newly reported dFHex, dFOct, and dFNon was studied by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) in ortho-dichlorobenzene (oDCB). A representative CV curve for the n-nonyl derivative is presented in Fig. 1b and Fig. S9 (ESI†). The CV curves show three overlapping pairs of reversible one-electron peaks, a typical signature of two coupled fullerene cages.33 The one-electron nature of all reduction steps was verified by deconvolution of the CV curves using the semi-integration techniques.36
The results that simulate steady-state voltammetric curves (see Fig. 1c and Fig. S9, ESI†) reveal equivalence of the observed peaks. The first reduction potential of the dFR compounds is situated between that of pristine C60 and PCBM, i.e. the effect of electron delocalization over the two fullerene cages is rather small, and, as evidenced by the redox potential values summarized in Table 1, the effect of varying of the alkyl chain is within only 0.03 V. As estimated from onsets of the reduction and oxidation peaks, the electrochemical HOMO and LUMO levels of the dFR compounds are, respectively, −3.8 eV and −5.6 eV, the electrochemical LUMO–HOMO gap of 1.8 eV being ca. 0.1 eV wider than the optical gap.

Thus, the frontier energy levels of the dFR compounds are mainly determined by the double-caged fullerene core and do not differ much from the single-caged analogs. Consequently, the open-circuit voltage VOC that is determined by the LUMO level of the acceptor will be the same for the whole range of double-caged molecules.
Still, the alkyl moiety can affect photovoltaic performance through other key parameters. To investigate that, a series of dFR-based bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated using a typical layer-by-layer architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:dFR/Ca/Al. Low solubility of n-butyl derivative dFBu impeded its testing for device fabrication. In the present study, we used the fabrication protocol previously optimized for n-decyl, benzyl and n-octadecyl double-caged compounds (dFDec, dFBn and dFODec, respectively).26 The active layer with a thickness of 120–130 nm was prepared by means of spin-coating at 700 rpm from a solution of the P3HT/dFR blend (2.5:1 w/w, total concentration of 25 mg mL−1) in oDCB. Before deposition of the metal electrode, thermal annealing of the active layer at 110 °C for 5 min was performed in order to increase the BHJ crystallinity and thus to enable better charge separation and transport of the free carriers. Annealing at higher temperatures of 120–160 °C was found to have an adverse effect of the photovoltaic properties, in contrast to the P3HT/PCBM based devices.3,38
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the fabricated P3HT/dFR devices are presented in Fig. 2a and b, the averaged and the best observed photovoltaic parameters being listed in Table 2 and shown in Fig. 2c–f. As one can see, the range of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) values spans between 1.2 and 3.0% depending on the alkyl moiety. Those variations appear to be mostly due to the dramatic differences in the short-circuit current density (JSC), 3.9 to 8.2 mA cm−2, while the variations in the open circuit voltage (VOC) and in the fill factor (FF) are far less significant. The JSC values calculated from EQE data turn out to be consistent with the measured ones.

The highest JSC and PCE values were observed in the blend of the n-nonyl compound dFNon (8.2 mA cm−2 and 3.0%, respectively), surpassing our previous best results for the n-decyl compound dFDec (7.6 mA cm−2 and 2.8%, respectively).26n-Nonyl compound dFNon exceeds other known fullerene oligomers with fused fullerene cages or cross-linked fullerene dimers demonstrating the highest JSC of 5.1–7.9 mA cm−2 in P3HT-based OSCs.21,24,40 Dumb-belled PCBM derivatives with two distant fullerene cores possess higher JSC values (up to 10.3 mA cm−2),22,23 evidencing the notable impact of the heteroatoms in the covalent linker on improvement of PV performance.
The PCE values of dFR compounds demonstrate markedly nonmonotonic dependence on the alkyl chain length (Fig. 2e), and the PCE values are 2.5, 1.7, 3.0, 2.8, and 1.2% for n-alkyl derivatives, which suggests a significant impact of the alkyl moiety on the morphology and, therefore, charge photogeneration, separation, and collection in the BHJ thin films. The origins of the intricate PCE dependence on the dFR alkyl size is possibly mediated by the solubility as discussed below. Additionally, variation in the surface tension of P3HT/dFR solution with the alkyl size could affect the coverage of ITO/PEDOT:PSS by the active layer and, thus, the photovoltaic performance of the devices. However, the contact angle measurements did not show any notable variation for various dFR acceptors (Fig. S10, ESI†). The similar contact angle values (±5°) were registered for solutions of P3HT, P3HT/dFBn, P3HT/dFNon, and P3HT/dFODec (13, 3, 14, and 10°, respectively) evidencing good wetting of the PEDOT:PSS surface irrespective of the alkyl moiety size.
It is generally believed that the solubility of the alkylated fullerene is improved with the increase in the alkyl chain length, as has been documented, e.g., for various methanofullerenes.8,41 On the one hand, higher solubility is beneficial for preventing phase segregation of the bulk heterojunction and the respective impairment of its morphology.42 On the other hand, in the excessively functionalized fullerenes the addends can screen the π-systems of the molecules from each other and thus hinder electron hopping between the acceptor molecules and polymer–fullerene charge photogeneration. The optimal trade-off between the two effects in the P3HT-based solar cells is achieved with the fullerene acceptors that have 30–80 mg mL−1 solubility in chlorobenzene.43
The solubility of the dFR compounds in oDCB is summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 2e. It broadly varies between 10 and 45 mg mL−1 (6–25 mmol L−1; oDCB at RT), the extremes being observed for n-butyl and n-octadecyl derivatives, respectively. Remarkably, there are some counterintuitive findings such as much lower solubility of the n-octyl compound dFOct compared to its closest n-hexyl and n-nonyl homologues (6 mmol L−1vs. 17 and 23 mg mL−1, respectively). One can hypothesize that dFOct forms a more stable crystalline phase due to better conformity of the n-octyl moiety and the intermolecular voids in the crystal lattice. Beyond dFOct, the molar solubilities of the n-nonyl, n-decyl, and n-octadecyl derivatives are rather close to each other within the range of 20–25 mmol L−1. With a double-caged structure of the dFR compounds, the solubility per fullerene cage is comparable for the dFR compounds and the reference PCBM (cp. 40–50 and 46 mmol L−1, respectively39).
As follows from Fig. 2c, d and f, the JSC, FF, and PCE values mostly correlate with solubility across the dFR family, but the n-octadecyl derivative dFODec violates the trend. We believe that to be a manifestation of the electron mobility factor due to higher cage shielding by a lengthy n-octadecyl chain. This hypothesis is also supported by the AFM observations described below. Note that similar findings have been reported for some P3HT-based OSCs with phenyl-C71-butyric esters (PC70BR, R = n-CmH2m+1; m = 1–9) where the n-heptyl ester provided the highest PCE while the n-nonyl ester had comparable solubility.44
The series (RS) and shunt (RSH) resistances of the best devices fabricated were calculated as the inverse slopes of the J–V curves at open circuit voltage and the short-current conditions, respectively (Table 2, Fig. 3a and Fig. S11a, ESI†). RS is commonly attributed to the Ohmic loss in the device contacts and active layer, whereas RSH usually reflects the extent of the leakage current through the device. JSC and FF are known to benefit from low RS, and high RSH favorably affects VOC and also FF.45–47 For the OSC devices studied, we observed a pronounced correlation due to their series resistance (Fig. 3b), but lack of clear trends related to the shunt resistance and large deviations for the dFOct and dFODec devices (Fig. S11c–f, ESI†). The FF values calculated from RS and RSH data47 turn out to be consistent with the measured ones (Fig. S11b, ESI†).

In general, the dFR-based devices demonstrate lower shunt resistances (0.44–0.72 kOhm cm2) compared to the PCBM-based device (0.98 ± 0.06 kOhm cm2). In terms of the series resistance, P3HT/dFR devices form two groups with RS values within the ranges of 7–13 and 19–22 Ohm cm2. Larger RS values were observed in the P3HT/dFOct and P3HT/dFODec devices with the worst photovoltaic performance. We believe that the RS values correlate with the bulk resistance of an active layer, while the contact resistance contributions are largely the same due to the reproducible fabrication protocol. The increased bulk resistance can be caused either by phase segregation (for low soluble dFOct) or by excessive fullerene cage shielding and increased intermolecular distance (for dFODec with long n-octadecyl chain). The general trend is illustrated by the dependence of the RSH/RS ratio on the dFR solubility (Fig. S12, ESI†). There is an increasing trend from the low-solubility n-octyl to higher-solubility n-nonyl derivative, but the n-octadecyl derivative manifests a special case likely due to the nanomorphology effect.
Direct investigation of the morphology of the active layer was performed by means of optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in semi-tapping mode. Optical microscopy did not reveal any macroscopic phase segregation in the active layers in all the devices, but the AFM images shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†) were more informative. The measured mean and RMS roughness (Ra and Rq) as well as maximum height (hmax) values are listed in Table 2. It was observed that the maximum height and roughness values strongly correlate with a determination coefficient R2 of 0.96 (Fig. S14, ESI†). The reference PCBM device has a smooth active layer with maximum domain heights of 10 nm and roughness of 1.1 nm, but the dFR devices exhibit coarser morphology with well separated P3HT-rich and dFR-rich domains with height of 23–36 nm and roughness of 3.8–6.4 nm. The largest domain sizes and roughness values of 32–36 and 4.8–6.4 nm, respectively, were found for dFHex, dFOct, and dFODec films evidencing a larger extent of phase segregation for (i) less-soluble derivatives with the smallest alkyl chains and for (ii) well-soluble derivatives with the longest alkyl chains. As is demonstrated in Fig. 3c and d and Fig. S15 (ESI†), the key photovoltaic parameters JSC, VOC, FF, PCE, and the RSH/RS ratio, indeed, improve upon reduction in the domain size and roughness, and the dFNon and dFDec thin films with the best photovoltaic performance have a smoother surface (hmax and Ra of 23–26 and 3.8–4.1 nm, respectively). It is worth noting that the domain sizes show no simple dependence on the alkyl chain length and on the solubility of the dFR compounds (Fig. S16, ESI†).
Conclusions
Seven double-caged C60-based dFR compounds with fullerene cages tightly linked through a four-membered cycle and a pyrrolizidine bridge with an ester function CO2R (R = n-butyl, benzyl, n-hexyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, n-decyl, and n-octadecyl) have been synthesized and spectroscopically characterized. The optical and CV data evidence that the LUMO levels and LUMO–HOMO gaps of the dFR compounds are −3.8 and 1.7 eV, respectively, and are mainly determined by the double-caged fullerene core rather than the ester alkyl chain. The compounds were tested as acceptor materials in P3HT-based organic solar cells and demonstrated strong dependence of JSC and PCE on the length of the alkyl moiety. Compared to PCBM, double-caged fullerenes provide coarser morphology with well-separated P3HT-rich and dFR-rich domains. The highest photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 3.0% was found with the n-nonyl dFR compound, thus exceeding other known fullerene oligomers with fused fullerene cages or cross-linked fullerene dimers.
Alkyl chain length nonmonotonically correlates with the dFR solubility that varies within the range of 10–45 mg mL−1 (6–25 mmol L−1). Maximum solubility was found for n-nonyl, n-decyl, and n-octadecyl derivatives (20–25 mmol L−1) where the solution concentration per fullerene cage (40–50 mmol L−1) is comparable to PCBM. Unexpectedly, the n-octyl derivative was found to be one of the least soluble compounds (6 mmol L−1). Except for the n-octadecyl derivative, PCE and JSC values of P3HT/dFR solar cells gradually increase with the dFR solubility due to improvement in the BHJ morphology and the resulting reduction in the series resistance. In the well-soluble n-octadecyl derivative, however, a too long alkyl chain causes more pronounced phase segregation and larger series resistance that eventually result in poor photovoltaic performance of the device. We expect that further improvement of the photovoltaic performance of the P3HT/dFR devices can be achieved by introduction of heteroatoms in the alkyl moiety and optimization of the device fabrication protocol.
