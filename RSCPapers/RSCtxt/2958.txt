    , Accepted 24th May 2023First published on 26th May 2023AbstractWe have successfully prepared a bio-photodetector based on chlorophyll derivatives as all photosensitive materials. Zinc methyl 3-devinyl-3-hydroxymethyl-pyropheophorbide-a (Chl-A) and methyl 131-deoxo-131-dicyanomethylene-pyropheophorbide-a (Chl-D) were used as electron acceptor and donor, respectively, where the two formed a heterojunction. Although the energy alignment of the photoactive layers of the device studied here is different from that of traditional photodetectors, the device can work well in a self-driven mode. The device has an optimized configuration, i.e., indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag, and exhibited excellent performance at self-biasing. When ZnO was applied as the electron transport layer in the ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag bio-photodetector device, the dark current density reduced significantly. Besides, the responsivity of the device reached 92.66 mA W−1, which is an increase by ~34 times compared to the ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device, and the specific detectivity reached 2.48 × 1011 Jones.
1. Introduction
Photodetectors convert optical signals into electrical signals and are widely used in various aspects of military and daily life.1–6 Current energy production technologies create problems, such as carbon dioxide emissions and global warming. Chlorophyll (Chl) and its derivatives, functioning as photoactive materials, have been applied in various kinds of photovoltaic devices owing to their major advantages, such as natural abundance, easy preparation, low cost, environmental friendliness, and others.7,8
Chl is the main natural organic semiconductor and plays a very important role in photosynthetic apparatus.9 Although the versatile properties of Chl have led to a series of investigations of Chl and its derivatives in solar energy conversion and storage devices, the related study of Chl in photodetectors is still very preliminary.10–19 In our study, a new bilayer Chl bio-photodetector was prepared by a Chl solution process and Z-scheme was introduced into the bio-photodetector. The Z-type bio-photodetector consists of two photoinduced electron separation steps, namely, photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), and an electron transfer chain connecting the two optical systems.20–23
In this study, a bio-photodetector utilizing bilayer Chl structure with Z-scheme is studied, in which molybdenum oxide (MoO3) was used as the hole transport layer (HTL) and zinc oxide (ZnO) as the electron transport layer (ETL).24,25 The aggregates of zinc methyl 3-devinyl-3-hydroxymethyl-pyropheophorbide-a (Chl-A) were used as the PSI simulator (electron acceptor) and methyl 131-deoxo-131-dicyanomethylene-pyropheophorbide-a (Chl-D) as the PSII simulator (electron donor) for the Z-type bio-photodetector. The structure of the device can be written as indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag. When ZnO was applied as the ETL in the ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag bio-photodetector device, the dark current density (JDark) reduced significantly. Besides, responsivity (R) increased by ~34 times compared to the ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device. The external quantum efficiency (EQE), specific detectivity (D*), and R of ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag devices were analyzed.
2. Experiment
2.1 Material preparation
Chl-A and Chl-D were prepared according to previous reports.26,27 ITO glass substrates were purchased from Liaoning Yike Precision New Energy Technology Co., Ltd MoO3 (99.9%), zinc acetate dihydrate (99.0%), ethanolamine (99.0%), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were purchased from Aladdin. 2-Methoxyethanol (99.5%) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd Ag (99.99%) was purchased from Tim (Beijing) New Material Technology Co., Ltd. Trichloromethane was purchased from Chengdu Cologne Chemicals Co., Ltd. All materials and reagents were used without further purification.
2.2 Device fabrication
The device, ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag, was fabricated as follows. The ITO substrate was pre-cleaned using an ultrasonic machine. The cleaning sequence was as follows: ITO glass detergent, deionized water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and ethanol, and each step was repeated twice for 30 min each time. A ZnO precursor solution was prepared by mixing 0.2 g zinc acetate dihydrate with 2 ml 2-methoxyethanol and adding 56 μl ethanolamine as a stabilizer, then it was stirred overnight. Chl-A was dissolved in THF:chloroform (CF) = 3:1 solvent system with a concentration of 9 mg ml−1. Chl-D was dissolved in CF with the same concentration. The cleaned ITO substrate was exposed to UV-ozone treatment for 15 min to improve the hydrophilic surface of the substrate. The ZnO precursor solution was then spin-coated onto the substrate with a spin speed of 3000 rpm and annealed immediately at 200 °C for 1 h in air. The substrates were transferred into a glove box, and then the Chl-A solution was spin-coated onto the substrates with a spin speed of 3000 rpm. The substrates coated with Chl-A solution were annealed at 45 °C for 3 min to obtain Chl-A film. The Chl-D solution was spin-coated onto the Chl-A film with a spin speed of 3000 rpm. After spinning, the substrates were annealed at 45 °C for 3 min to obtain Chl-D film. The prepared substrates were kept in a high vacuum chamber for the ordered thermal deposition of MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (100 nm). The ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag, ITO/Chl-A/MoO3/Ag, and ITO/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag devices were prepared under the same conditions.
2.3 Characterization
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-1900 spectrophotometer. CV measurements were carried out using a VSP multichannel potentiostatic-galvanostatic system (Bio-Logic SAS, France). The J–V curves of the Z-type bio-photodetector device were recorded using a Keithley 2401 source meter at an irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 under AM 1.5 solar simulator. EQE spectra were recorded in air under short-circuit conditions using a commercial EQE setup (CrowntechQTest Station 1000AD, SOFN INSTRUMENTS CO., LTD) equipped with a 100 W Xe arc lamp, a filter wheel, and a monochromator. Monochromatic light was chopped at a frequency of 80 Hz and photocurrents were measured using a lock-in amplifier. Response time was measured with 377-nm laser pulse (NL 100 N2 laser) excitation of around 4 ns duration.
2.4 Photoelectrochemical measurements
CV measurements in CH2Cl2 were carried out with a three-electrode cell and a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as a supporting electrolyte. The working electrode and the counter pole were platinum wires. Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode, and the potentials were calibrated with a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an internal standard.
3. Results and discussion
In this study, zinc methyl 3-devinyl-3-hydroxymethyl-pyropheophorbide-a (Chl-A) and methyl 131-deoxo-131-dicyanomethylene-pyropheophorbide-a (Chl-D) functioned as electron acceptor and donor, respectively. The synthetic routes of Chl-A and Chl-D were compared, as shown in Fig. 1.26,27
 Fig. 1  Synthetic routes of Chl-A and Chl-D. 

Fig. 2a and b show the absorption spectra of Chl-A and Chl-D, respectively, both in a monomeric solution (dashed line) and in the aggregated film (solid line). Compared with the Qy band absorption peak of the Chl monomer, a red shift in the aggregated film was observed. The red shift in the Chl-A absorption peak originated from the aggregation of the intermolecular self-assembly and π–π stacking.26 Similarly, the red shift in the absorption peak of Chl-D indicated the formation of J-aggregates. The absorption spectra of the Chl-A/Chl-D bilayer film show that both the sublayer Chl-A and the upper layer Chl-D contribute to the absorption peaks (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The bilayer structure of our device was verified by dropping chloroform (CF) onto the sublayer Chl-A film (see details in Fig. S2, ESI†).

Fig. 2c and d show the cyclic voltammetry curves of Chl-A and Chl-D, respectively, from which the oxidation onset potentials (Eonsetox) of these two Chls were determined to be 0.50 and 0.87 V (see details in Fig. S3a and S3b, ESI†), respectively. The half-wave potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was measured to be 0.61 V (Eferrocene = 0.61 V). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of Chls could be calculated by the following formulas: HOMO (eV) = −e{Eonsetox − Eferrocene + 4.8}(1) LUMO (eV) = HOMO + Eoptg(2) Eoptg = 1240/λonset(3)where Eoptg represents the optical band gap. The calculated Eoptg values of the Chl-A and Chl-D solutions were 1.89 and 1.73 eV (see details in Fig. S3c and S3d, ESI†), respectively. Table 1 summarizes the oxidation potentials and energy levels of the Chl-A and Chl-D solutions. The calculated Eoptg values of the Chl-A and Chl-D films were 1.61 and 1.59 eV (see details in Fig. S3e and S3f, ESI†), respectively. Table S1 (ESI†) summarizes the energy levels of both Chl-A and Chl-D films.

Fig. 2e shows a schematic diagram of the device. As the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of Chl-A are higher than those of Chl-D, Chl-A can function as P700 in PSI and Chl-D mimics P680 in PSII. The photoexcited electrons of Chl-A were collected on the ITO cathode, while the photoexcited electrons of Chl-D combined with holes in the HOMO of Chl-A to reproduce Chl-A. Thus, holes in the HOMO of Chl-D were transported to HTL and were eventually collected on the Ag anode.

Fig. 3 shows atomic force microscopy (AFM) 3D images of Chl-A and Chl-D, which were prepared by spin-coating Chl-A in THF:CF = 3:1 (9 mg mL−1) and Chl-D in CF (9 mg mL−1). As can be seen from Fig. 3, the square-mean-root (SMR) value of Chl-A was larger than that of Chl-D, indicating the surface of Chl-A was rougher than that of Chl-D and the layered accumulation of Chl-A was more compact, with the RMS values of Chl-A and Chl-D being 9.73 nm and 1.38 nm, respectively. Moreover, the RMS value of Chl-A was larger than that of Chl-D mainly because the Chl-A aggregates were larger in size than Chl-D aggregates.

Fig. 4a shows J–V curves of the ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device, and Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows J–V curves of the ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/Ag, ITO/Chl-A/MoO3/Ag, and ITO/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag devices. Although the ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/Ag, ITO/Chl-A/MoO3/Ag, and ITO/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag devices have a dynamic response, the JLight/JDark ratio of ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device was significantly higher than those of four-layer structures shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Fig. 4b shows the comparison of JDark between ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/Ag and ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag. The JDark value of the bilayer Chl device decreased significantly when MoO3 was applied. We further studied the influence of different MoO3 thickness on the ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device and found that the device with 10 nm MoO3 showed the best performance, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†).

(d) EQE, R, and D* curves of the ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device at 0 V. 
Device response speed is an important index to measure photodetector performance. The response time of the ITO/Chl-A/MoO3/Ag, ITO/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag, and ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag devices were determined to be around 95, 79, and 62 μs, respectively, based on the transient photocurrent decay, as shown in Fig. 4c.28–31 The I–t curves of the ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device under a 532 nm laser are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†).

Fig. 4d displays the curves of EQE, R, and D* values of the ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag bio-photodetector device. The EQE value of the ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device was measured over a wide spectral range (330–750 nm), as shown in Fig. 4d. Larger EQE values were located at 380–450 and 700–720 nm. The EQE spectra was consistent with the varying trend of the Chl-A/Chl-D absorption spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†).

R and EQE are interconnected by the following equation: (4)Therefore, with the calculation of EQE, the R value of ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device was calculated at 0 V as a function of the illuminated wavelength ranging from 330 to 750 nm and the results are represented by the red curve in Fig. 4d. The maximum R value achieved for the heterojunction devices was 2.7 mA W−1 under 430 nm at 0 V.
In addition, another important parameter for a photodetector is D*. A photodetector with a large D* value has a strong capability of detecting a weak incoming signal. D* can be calculated by using the following equation32 (5)where JDark is the current density in dark, and q is the charge of an electron. D* was evaluated as a function of incident wavelength, and the corresponding D* versus the incident wavelength plots at 0 V is represented by the blue curve in Fig. 4d. Under 0 V, the D* value of ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag reached 1.2 × 109 Jones.

Fig. 5a shows J–V curves of the ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device with and without illumination. When ZnO was used as ETL, the JDark value decreased from 1.5 × 10−2 mA cm−2 to 4.36 × 10−4 mA cm−2. The structure of the ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device is shown in Fig. 5b. Fig. 5c shows the response time of the ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device to be 125 μs at −0.1 V. Fig. 5d shows the curves of EQE, R, and D* values of the ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device at 0 V. Larger EQE values were located at 380–450 and 700–720 nm. The red curve in Fig. 5d represents the R value of the ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device. The maximum R value achieved for the devices was 92.66 mA W−1 under 715 nm at 0 V. When ZnO was used as the ETL, the R value increased by ~34 times. The blue curve in Fig. 5d represents the D* value of the ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device at 0 V, from which we can see that the maximum value of D* reached 2.48 × 1011 Jones. Fig. 5e and f show the photoresponse properties of the ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device under different light. Fig. 5e shows photoresponse properties under a 532 nm laser with intensities 273.68, 41.43, and 12.54 mW cm−2 at 0 V, while Fig. 5f shows the same under red light with intensities from 4 to 94 mW cm−2. These curves show that the photocurrent increased with the increase in light intensity. This indicated that the device has a good light intensity dependence, which is extremely beneficial for a photodetector to work in different light and dark environments. Furthermore, the I–t curves, shown in Fig. 5f, were not square pulses, which can be explained by considering that when the light was turned off, a small fraction of the charge carriers remained in the active layer. Moreover, the device exhibited excellent environmental stability, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Table 2 summarizes the performances of the ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag devices.

Working under a bias voltage, although an applied electric field can be used to accelerate charge collection for fast response and higher efficiency, external electrons (i.e., leakage current) will be injected into the device from the electrode, which results in an increase in the dark current and adversely affects device performance.33 ZnO and MoO3 were used to block the charge injection under bias voltage, which greatly reduced the JDark value.24,25,34,35
4. Conclusion
In this study, Z-scheme was applied to fabricate an ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag bio-photodetector device and a heterojunction was formed in-between by Chl-A and Chl-D. Chl-A was used as the PSI simulator (electron acceptor) and Chl-D as the PSII simulator (electron donor) for the Z-type bio-photodetector. This heterojunction type bio-photodetector was proved to work well in a self-driven mode. With ZnO as the ETL and MoO3 as the HTL, the JDark value of this heterojunction type device was greatly reduced and the D* value of the ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device reached 2.48 × 1011 Jones at 0 V bias. When ZnO was used as the ETL, the R value increased by ~34 times (compared with the ITO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device). The R value achieved for the ITO/ZnO/Chl-A/Chl-D/MoO3/Ag device was 92.66 mA W−1 under 715 nm at 0 V. In summary, a Chl-based bio-photodetector, as a new photodetector, has shown to have great development prospects owing to its simple structure and environmental safety.
