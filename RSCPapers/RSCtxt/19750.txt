R. ChinaReceived 6th June 2013, Accepted 14th August 2013First published on 20th August 2013AbstractHigh-performance bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) processed from non-halogenated solvents with power conversion efficiency values over 7% are demonstrated for the first time. The effects of these solvents on the morphology, charge mobility, and PSC device performance have been systematically studied. The general applicability of these non-halogenated solvents to diverse polymer/fullerene systems has also been demonstrated.Broader contextThe development of solution processable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has grown rapidly and the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the state-of-the-art device has recently surpassed 10%. When considering their potential for commercial applications, the processing procedures for large-area solar cells need to be seriously evaluated. Since large amounts of solvents are used in the roll-to-roll printing of large-area modules, it is imperative to search for more environmentally friendly solvents. So far, most of the high-performance bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OPV devices have been made from acutely toxic halogenated solvents, such as chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene. In this paper, the OPVs processed from non-halogenated solvents with PCE values over 7% are demonstrated for the first time in both conventional and inverted device configurations. The effect of non-halogenated solvents on the morphology, charge mobility, and OPV performance of cast films is systematically investigated to compare with their halogenated counterparts. In addition to the success of selecting non-halogenated solvents, this paper also demonstrates the general applicability of these solvents to diverse polymer/fullerene BHJ systems. The results show that these solvents are excellent alternatives for roll-to-roll printing of large-area modules of high-performance OPVs.As the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution processable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has increased rapidly to surpass the 10% milestone,1 it has reached the stage where processing solvents and conditions need to be seriously considered in order for them to be suitable for large-scale practical applications. One of the major concerns is to find environmentally friendly solvents for large-area printing of OPV devices. To date, most of the common solvents and additives used for making high-performance OPVs are based on halogenated ones, e.g., chlorobenzene (CB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), diiodooctane (DIO), and chloronaphthalene (CN). Unfortunately, these solvents do not exist in nature and they are more expensive and energy-intensive to produce.2 In addition, there exist serious concerns over their adverse impact on human health and the environment, which may exclude them from being the ultimate choice of processing solvents for large-scale manufacturing of OPVs.3 Therefore, there is an urgent need to search for better solvent alternatives to fabricate efficient OPVs. Even though extensive efforts have been devoted to find replacements for halogenated solvents, only very limited success has been achieved so far.4–12In general, the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) based devices consist of a layer of a conjugated oligomer/polymer-based electron donor (D) that is blended with a fullerene-based electron acceptor (A). Due to the limited exciton diffusion length in organic semiconductors (10–20 nm),13 finely interpenetrating phase-separated domains of tens of nanometers are considered as the ideal BHJ morphology to achieve efficient exciton dissociation before their decay. It has been proven that precise control of the morphology of the BHJ layer is the key to achieve high-performance OPVs since appropriate domain sizes and vertical distributions of blended components in the BHJ layer will ensure efficient charge separation and transport.14,15However, the morphology of the BHJ layer is dominated by the processing conditions of devices. Consequently, many factors including the miscibility of the blended components and the drying process of the evolving thin film need to be carefully manipulated while choosing suitable solvents for device processing. At present, halogenated solvents such as CB and o-DCB are the most frequently used ones due to their high boiling points, adequate viscosity, and superior solubility for nonpolar conjugated oligomers/polymers and fullerene derivatives (Table 1). When compared to halogenated solvents, the non-halogenated ones usually produce less ideal BHJ morphologies due to their inferior physical properties for device processing and lower solubility for conjugated oligomers/polymers and fullerene derivatives.4–6 Therefore, these solvents are often neglected.7–12 To alleviate these problems, it is necessary to improve their physical properties and solubility for conjugated oligomers/polymers and fullerene derivatives.

In addition, they usually possess good solubility for most oligomers/polymers because these solvents are often used in the synthesis and polymerization of the above materials. Meanwhile, the MBs have certain advantages over chlorobenzenes based on the production methods and cost mentioned earlier. The production of chlorobenzenes involves toxic chlorination while the MBs can be obtained by simple distillation or solvent extraction from the crude oil. Halogenation will definitely increase the production cost and cause environmental concerns. More importantly, MBs are also biodegradable and can be decomposed with relative ease to address the health and environmental concerns (the related health and environmental effects of the studied MBs are appended in the ESI†).16 However, the main drawback of these solvents is their poorer solubility for fullerene derivatives. This often results in severe phase segregation of large fullerene-rich grains in the cast films, limiting the corresponding device performance.8,9,17–19 Thus, it is very critical to enhance the fullerene solubility in these solvents.Recently, we have demonstrated that high-performance BHJ devices can be successfully processed from these MB solvents by rationally increasing the fullerene solubility.12 Encouraged by these results, we have further expanded the list of non-halogenated solvents to test their general applicability to a series of diverse polymer/fullerene BHJ systems.The influence of MBs on the morphology, charge mobility, and OPV device performance was thoroughly investigated in a high-performance ladder-type polymer system, PIDTT-DFBT, which has been used to make devices with a PCE of >7% (Fig. 1).20 The processing conditions were optimized initially based on the changes of BHJ morphology observed after being processed from different MBs. Then, field-effect transistors (FETs) based on thin films processed with these solvents were fabricated to understand the effects of non-halogenated solvents on the charge mobility. Finally, OPV devices in both the conventional and inverted configurations were made to validate the suitability of these solvents. It is very encouraging to find out that devices with a high PCE of ∼7% could be achieved in both conventional and inverted configurations, which are even better than those processed with halogenated solvents. In addition to these explorations, it is also important to test their general applicability to other high-performance BHJ systems. Another high-performance benzodithiophene (BDT)-based polymer (PBDT-DTNT),21 which has been shown to possess stronger intermolecular packing behavior than PIDTT-DFBT, was chosen for a comparative study. Besides, a fullerene bis-adduct, IC60BA,22 was used to replace PC71BM to evaluate the general applicability of these solvents to versatile BHJ systems (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1  Chemical structures of the studied (a) polymers and fullerenes and (b) non-halogenated solvents/additives. While toluene has been shown to be a promising solvent for OPV processing in our previous study,12 MBs with two or more methyl groups are even better for device processing because they have higher boiling points and are more viscous, as can be seen in Table 1. Among various isomers of xylenes and trimethylbenzenes, o-xylene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (1,2,4-TMB) were found to be the optimal ones for BHJ OPV processing due to their higher boiling point, viscosity and fullerene solubility (Table S1†). The increased methyl group numbers in MBs will dramatically enhance the solubility of fullerene derivatives.23 As shown in Table 1, the solubility of fullerene in 1,2,4-TMB improves to ∼18 mg ml−1, which is twice that of fullerene dissolved in o-xylene.Morphology of bulk-heterojunction filmsTo verify the influence of improved fullerene solubility on the BHJ morphology, a BHJ consisting of PIDTT-DFBT:PC71BM (1:3) was prepared from these MBs. As expected, the morphology of the BHJ film cast from 1,2,4-TMB shows better fullerene miscibility than that cast from o-xylene, as shown in Fig. 2b and c. The film cast from 1,2,4-TMB exhibited smaller clusters (ca. 80–230 nm) than that cast from o-xylene (ca. 170–400 nm), while all these clusters began to merge into each other to form a continuous fullerene phase. However, neither of the films possesses the appropriate morphology that can be achieved by processing with o-DCB (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2  The AFM height images (2 × 2 μm2) and surface profile (5 to −5 nm) of PIDTT-DFBT:PC71BM BHJ processed from (a) o-DCB, (b) o-xylene, (c) 1,2,4-TMB, (d) o-xylene/1,2-DMN, and (e) 1,2,4-TMB/1,2-DMN. (f) Hansen solubility parameter (HSP) diagrams of PC71BM and related solvents.31,32 As shown in the literature,24–30 the addition of a small amount of high boiling point additives to processing solvents significantly promotes micro-phase separation in the BHJ films because they have differential solubility for one of the components in the blend and the ability to prolong the drying time for crystallization. Interestingly, it was found that the solvent additives have a profound effect on the fullerene solubility when they were added to the non-halogenated solvents.12 This phenomenon could be analyzed by using the Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs).31–33 The Hildebrand solubility parameter (δ) indicates that the miscibility of the components in a blended system is dependent on the cohesive energy densities (E/V), which is the energy required to infinitely separate a unit volume of any given molecule from its neighbors. There are three factors that contribute to the HSPs: the dispersive forces (δD), the dipolar intermolecular forces (δP), and hydrogen bonding forces (δH).31 It can be defined by eqn (1),31 δ2 = (E/V) = δD2 + δP2 + δH2(1)where E is the energy change of evaporation and V is the molar volume. HSPs for each solvent/solute can be represented as a point in the Cartesian coordinate system. Accordingly, the solubility of a solute in a particular solvent is estimated by using the Hansen sphere, where the HSPs of solvents are located at the center of the sphere and Ro is the interaction radius. The solubility of solutes can be considered as good when their HSPs fall within the range of Ro of the solvent, and vice versa. The distance between the solute and solvent HSPs is described as Ra, which can be defined by eqn (2),31 Ra2 = 4(δD1 − δD2)2 + (δP1 − δP2)2 + (δH1 − δH2)2(2)where the subscripts 1 and 2 represent the solute and solvent, respectively.Combining the Ra with the Ro gives the relative energy difference (RED = Ra/Ro), which provides a quantitative estimate of the solubility of the solute: highly soluble when RED is <1, partially soluble when RED = 1, and insoluble when RED is >1.31 As can be seen in Fig. 2f, the HSPs of the halogenated solvents such as CB and o-DCB are located near to that of PC71BM,31,32 which indicates that the addition of additives will not change the fullerene solubility significantly. Meanwhile, all the HSPs of the non-halogenated MBs are located far away from that of PC71BM (Fig. 2f), indicating their poor fullerene solubility. However, the solubility of fullerenes can be significantly improved by incorporating a small amount of additives such as 1-methylnaphthalene (1-MN).34 It is clearly shown that the δD and δH of the solvents increased after adding 1-MN, leading to a decreased RED and better miscibility with PC71BM.Based on this finding, all morphologies of the films cast from non-halogenated solvents were dramatically improved after adding 2.5 vol% of 1,2-dimethylnaphthalene (1,2-DMN) as shown in Fig. 2d and e. All large clusters disappeared and all of the BHJ films exhibited much finer D/A phase separation, which is very similar to that of the optimized films cast from o-DCB (Fig. 2a). Since the prolonged drying time facilitates the D/A interpenetration, 1,2-DMN was used in this study instead of 1-MN due to its higher boiling point (Table S2†). The influence of different additives on the device performance is discussed in the later section. Despite the significant variation in BHJ morphology, the UV-vis spectra of the BHJ films derived from these solvents are similar (Fig. S1†), which ensures comparable light-harvesting abilities of the BHJ layer. Given similar light-harvesting behavior and appropriate morphology of thin films derived from these non-halogenated MB co-solvents, it is quite promising to use them to replace halogenated ones for high-performance OPV processing.Field-effect transistor fabrication and characterizationIn addition to affecting the BHJ morphology, the processing solvents may also influence the charge mobility. Until now, there has been very limited information in the literature about selecting non-halogenated solvents for FET processing.35 It is essential to understand the charge-transporting properties of the BHJ films processed from these solvents. To compare them properly, both polymer and BHJ films cast from o-DCB and carefully chosen non-halogenated co-solvents were prepared in parallel and their bottom gate/top contact FET devices were fabricated at the same time. The detailed parameters are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 3a, the charge mobility of PIDTT-DFBT cast from optimized non-halogenated co-solvents showed similar high values to that cast from o-DCB. Among which, the hole-mobility of PIDTT-DFBT cast from 1,2,4-TMB/1,2-DMN was improved to ∼6.4 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 while the electron mobility was around ∼10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. The addition of 1,2-DMN as a co-solvent did not affect the charge mobility of PIDTT-DFBT (data not shown here). This shows the potential of utilizing MBs as solvents for conjugated polymers to fabricate electronic devices. After evaluating the charge mobility of the pristine polymer, the mobility of the BHJ films was also investigated. The results also showed comparable charge mobilities of BHJ films, regardless of the processing solvents used (Fig. 3b).

The concentration of 1,2-DMN is 2.5% by volume. The film cast from 1,2,4-TMB/1,2-DMN exhibited higher hole (∼1.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron (∼6.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) mobilities while the film cast from o-xylene/1,2-DMN showed a slightly lower hole (∼0.7 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron (∼2.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) mobilities, which is believed to be caused by the poorer solubility of the blended components in o-xylene than in 1,2,4-TMB.8,9,17–19,23 These results and observed BHJ morphology suggest that BHJ films cast from optimized non-halogenated co-solvents exhibit efficient charge separation and transport, which are almost identical to those of BHJ films cast from typical halogenated solvents.Photovoltaic device fabrication and characterizationGiven that a satisfactory morphology and good charge mobility can be achieved in the PIDTT-DFBT:PC71BM (1:3) BHJ, the OPV device derived from it has also been explored. The details of device fabrication are described in the ESI.† A conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PIDTT-DFBT:PC71BM (1:3)/bis-C60/Ag was constructed initially to understand the suitability of these non-halogenated co-solvents.20,36Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves of these devices measured under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination conditions. The detailed device characteristics including the open-circuit voltage (Voc), current density (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE are summarized in Table 3. Obviously, the devices cast from either neat o-xylene or 1,2,4-TMB showed much worse performance compared to that fabricated from regular o-DCB due to poor morphology (Fig. 2b and c). However, the one fabricated from 1,2,4-TMB showed higher Jsc and FF over the one fabricated from o-xylene due to the improved morphology. Then, additives were added to o-xylene to study their effect on the morphology and device performance.

All devices fabricated from the co-solvents showed much enhanced performance compared to those derived from neat MBs due to their improved morphology resulting from the increased fullerene solubility in co-solvents. Among all, the device derived from 1,2-DMN showed the best performance with the highest Jsc (Voc: 0.97 V, Jsc: 12.89 mA cm−2, FF: 0.57, and 7.15%), which is very close to that of the control device obtained from o-DCB (Voc: 0.97 V, Jsc: 12.96 mA cm−2, FF: 0.57, and PCE: 7.22%). The higher device performance from using 1,2-DMN compared to two other additives might be due to its higher boiling point (ca. 266–267 °C),37 which prolongs the drying process for the D/A phase interpenetration. Finally, 1,2-DMN was added to 1,2,4-TMB for OPV processing. Very encouragingly, the resulting device showed the best performance (Voc: 0.97 V, Jsc: 12.97 mA cm−2, FF: 0.58, and PCE: 7.26%), which is equivalent to that of the control device fabricated from o-DCB (7.22%). This has also been the highest PCE obtained so far for the BHJ devices processed with non-halogenated solvents.6–12 All these results further validate that the enhanced fullerene solubility in the MBs effectively reduces the micro-phase segregation of BHJ films, leading to efficient charge separation and transport. As a result, these devices can achieve similar device performance compared to optimum BHJ films cast from o-DCB (Fig. 4b). The calculated Jsc from the EQE shown in Fig. 4c verifies that these non-halogenated co-solvents are very promising alternative solvents for making high-performance OPV devices.In order to realize the homogeneous D/A vertical phase distribution for the BHJ films processed from non-halogenated solvents,38 an inverted device structure consisting of ITO/ZnO/C60-SAM/PIDTT-DFBT:PC71BM (1:3)/MoOx/Ag was fabricated. It is shown in Fig. 5 that the devices processed from the optimized non-halogenated co-solvent show comparable performances (Voc: 0.97 V, Jsc: 11.95 mA cm−2, FF: 0.59, and PCE: 6.92% from the o-xylene/1,2-DMN-cast BHJ layer; Voc: 0.98 V, Jsc: 12.03 mA cm−2, FF: 0.59, and PCE: 6.95% from the 1,2,4-TMB/1,2-DMN-cast BHJ layer) to the control device processed from o-DCB (Voc: 0.98 V, Jsc: 11.82 mA cm−2, FF: 0.58, and PCE: 6.71%). It implies that an optimal BHJ layer can be generated from these non-halogenated co-solvents in both the conventional and inverted device structures. Fig. 5  (a) The J–V curves and (b) EQE spectra of the inverted devices of PIDTT-DFBT:PC71BM (1:3) processed from different solvents under illumination (simulated AM1.5G) at 100 mW cm−2. The concentration of 1,2-DMN is 2.5% by volume. For practical applications, it is important to show that these non-halogenated co-solvents can be generally applicable to diverse polymer systems. Therefore, another high-performance BDT-based polymer, PBDT-DTNT,21 was chosen for exploration. The ladder-type polymers (PIDTT-DFBT, herein) are known to show irregular packing patterns, which favors the predominantly amorphous morphology. This can be verified from the results obtained from UV-vis spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).20,39 The UV-vis spectra of PBDT-DTNT (Fig. S2†) exhibit obvious red-shifted peaks in the film state, implying stronger intermolecular packing. To test if non-halogenated processing conditions can be applied to the stronger packed polymer system, a PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM (1:1) based BHJ was processed to evaluate its device performance in the conventional structure. As it can be seen in Fig. 6, the devices processed from non-halogenated co-solvents show comparable performances (Voc: 0.79 V, Jsc: 11.82 mA cm−2, FF: 0.65, and PCE: 6.10% from the o-xylene/1,2-DMN-cast BHJ layer; Voc: 0.82 V, Jsc: 11.49 mA cm−2, FF: 0.65, and PCE: 6.11% from the 1,2,4-TMB/1,2-DMN-cast BHJ layer) to that fabricated from o-DCB (Voc: 0.82 V, Jsc: 11.47 mA cm−2, FF: 0.62, and PCE: 5.86%). The successful application of these co-solvents in processing PBDT-DTNT suggests that they can be used for diverse conjugated polymer systems. Fig. 6  (a) The J–V curves and (b) EQE spectra of the conventional devices of PBDT-DTNT:PC71BM (1:1) processed from different solvents under illumination (simulated AM1.5G) at 100 mW cm−2. The concentration of 1,2-DMN is 2.5% by volume. In parallel to the examination of the applicability of co-solvents to different polymer systems, it is also very important to understand their effect on different fullerene derivatives such as IC60BA, which is different from the prevalent PC71BM.21 The blend system of IC60BA and P3HT has been extensively utilized for making high-efficiency (PCE over 10%) tandem solar cells.1,40 The large band-gap of P3HT (∼1.90 eV) and the high-lying LUMO of IC60BA enable them to function effectively in front cells to harvest light of shorter wavelengths. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effect of non-halogenated processing conditions on such a system.1,40 The same inverted device structures aforementioned consisting of P3HT:IC60BA (1:1) as the BHJ were fabricated. As shown in Fig. 7, both devices processed from the optimized non-halogenated co-solvents showed better performance (Voc: 0.83 V, Jsc: 10.92 mA cm−2, FF: 0.63, and PCE: 5.71% from the o-xylene/1,2-DMN-cast BHJ layer; Voc: 0.83 V, Jsc: 10.47 mA cm−2, FF: 0.63, and PCE: 5.50% from the 1,2,4-TMB/1,2-DMN-cast BHJ layer) than that obtained from the control using o-DCB as the solvent (Voc: 0.84 V, Jsc: 9.79 mA cm−2, FF: 0.56, and PCE: 4.60%) without any solvent annealing.1,22a These results are comparable to the values reported for the state-of-the-art tandem cells.1 Higher EQE (Fig. 7b) of these devices further confirms the advantages of using non-halogenated co-solvents for processing OPV cells. Fig. 7  (a) The J–V curves and (b) EQE spectra of the inverted devices of P3HT:IC60BA (1:1) processed from different solvents under illumination (simulated AM1.5G) at 100 mW cm−2. The concentration of 1,2-DMN is 2.5% by volume. ConclusionIn summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that BHJ OPVs of PCE values over 7% can be processed from non-halogenated co-solvents in both conventional and inverted device configurations. This detailed study also demonstrates the general applicability of these non-halogenated solvents to diverse polymer systems and fullerene derivatives. The results from the systematically investigated morphology, charge mobility, and device performance of BHJ films cast from these non-halogenated co-solvents showed that they are good alternatives for roll-to-roll printing of high-performance solar cells.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation's NSF-STC program under Grant no.

Table Content:
Broader contextThe development of solution processable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has grown rapidly and the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the state-of-the-art device has recently surpassed 10%. When considering their potential for commercial applications, the processing procedures for large-area solar cells need to be seriously evaluated. Since large amounts of solvents are used in the roll-to-roll printing of large-area modules, it is imperative to search for more environmentally friendly solvents. So far, most of the high-performance bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OPV devices have been made from acutely toxic halogenated solvents, such as chlorobenzene or dichlorobenzene. In this paper, the OPVs processed from non-halogenated solvents with PCE values over 7% are demonstrated for the first time in both conventional and inverted device configurations. The effect of non-halogenated solvents on the morphology, charge mobility, and OPV performance of cast films is systematically investigated to compare with their halogenated counterparts. In addition to the success of selecting non-halogenated solvents, this paper also demonstrates the general applicability of these solvents to diverse polymer/fullerene BHJ systems. The results show that these solvents are excellent alternatives for roll-to-roll printing of large-area modules of high-performance OPVs.
