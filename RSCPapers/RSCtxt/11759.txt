    , Accepted 15th October 2020First published on 15th October 2020AbstractThe feasibility of using organic thermoelectric devices to power sensors for different applications is a critical area of interest for researchers. Organic semiconductors possess lower thermoelectric performance than their inorganic counterparts, however, this can be compensated for by certain advantages, such as their light weight, low fabrication costs, and low fabrication temperatures. For practical applications, they face competition with Li-ion batteries, which are known for their high energy densities and long lifetimes. Thus, in addition to having a suitable corresponding power output, ideal organic thermoelectric devices require excellent stability. In this study, such a perspective was examined via primarily focusing on recent studies of organic thermoelectric devices and, particularly, their practical applications. The impact of contact resistance on device performance has been discussed, together with suggestions of certain promising device structures for organic thermoelectric devices. Experimentally, it was confirmed that light and compact organic thermoelectric devices with a size of ∼10 cm2 should be sufficiently suitable to power sensors. Moreover, these devices were confirmed to operate under natural cooling conditions without a heat sink, thus showing excellent stability for >70 days under continuous working conditions at 100 °C.Masakazu MukaidaMasakazu Mukaida earned his PhD in 1990 from Tohoku University.

1. Introduction
As the Internet of Things (IoT) evolves, billions of sensors are expected to be embedded in the virtual environment connected by computing systems, software, and services, and these will impact on our daily lives,1 especially for monitoring applications in infrastructure, the factory environment, and health industries. Sensors for internet applications, however, have had recognizable setbacks. In addition to the sensor part, the power source can sometimes be an issue, e.g., electrical wiring is not a smart choice for wireless sensors. Batteries could power the sensors, but constantly replacing or charging expired batteries may complicate the supply generation process. One good solution is to develop self-powered sensors that harvest energy from the outside environment.2–4 Different energy techniques can be used to harvest and use energy from known sources such as light, electromagnetic radiation, heat, vibration, motion, and magnetic strength.5,6 Unlike such sources, thermal energy is distributed almost everywhere. It is reported that the achievable energy density with thermal energy ranges from μW cm−2 to mW cm−2, which matches the energy consumption of the sensors.7,8
Thermoelectric devices have been studied for their potential suitability to directly convert heat into electricity for sensor applications, because of the absence of moving parts that would make them compact and reliable.9 Early research work concerning thermoelectric materials primarily focused on inorganic semiconductors such as Bi–Te alloys, Mg–Si alloys, and metal oxides.10–15 These materials mostly exhibit good performance at temperatures of >200 °C, although the waste heat in the environment is usually at temperatures of <150 °C. The most common low-temperature thermoelectric material used is Bi2Te3. However, because Te is an expensive rare metal and not environmentally friendly, its production may be unsuitable for large area applications. Furthermore, because inorganic thermoelectric devices are typically fabricated by a sintering process at high temperatures, the energy payback could be challenging to achieve. In this sense, utilizing heat to fabricate self-powered sensors demands eco-friendly thermoelectric devices.
Organic thermoelectric materials and devices have recently become a recognizable topic in the research community.7,16–25 Although organic materials have been known to demonstrate lower thermoelectric performance than their inorganic counterparts, certain characteristics that they possess, such as a light weight (the density of organic materials is typically ∼1 g cm−3, that of Bi2Te3 is ∼8 g cm−3),26,27 low environmental impact, and flexibility, give them a critical advantage for applications in the self-powered sensor field. Unfortunately, there are not many studies reported on device fabrication and identifying the added value of using organic thermoelectric devices. In this report, recent pioneering studies involving the practical applications of organic thermoelectric devices are highlighted. The primary topic is not the material properties, but some of the contemporary organic thermoelectric materials that have been developed. A discussion of the effect of contact resistance on the device performance is provided, together with suggestions of a possible approach to reduce the contact resistance. Several promising device structures for organic thermoelectric devices are discussed, especially when considering the anisotropy of material properties, heat flow directions, and cooling mechanisms. In the later sections, the stability of organic thermoelectric devices will be discussed and it will be demonstrated that a compact organic thermoelectric module based on self-power sensors could have excellent durability.
2. Material properties
Organic semiconductors possess certain thermoelectric properties, such as the Seebeck effect, which have long been studied with the development of organic conductors. In organic conducting materials, the Seebeck effect is a physical parameter used to determine the carrier type and relative carrier concentration.28 With the recent efforts in developing organic electronics, the physical and chemical properties of organic conducting polymers have improved such that they can now tune over a wide range, making them suitable for thermoelectric applications.16,26,29–38
Similar to inorganic thermoelectric materials, the organic ones can either be p-type or n-type. N-type organic thermoelectric materials are relatively limited given the significant challenges they face to achieve efficient doping and stability towards moisture and oxygen.39–44 Nevertheless, several pioneering studies demonstrated certain promising thermoelectric properties of the n-type organic thermoelectric materials via molecular doping.39–41,45–56 For example, Pei and co-workers synthesized a series of benzodifurandione-based poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (BDPPV) derivatives that exhibit electron mobility of up to 1.70 cm2 (V−1 s−1) under ambient conditions (Fig. 1a).52 The low LUMO levels in these polymers caused the efficient electron transfer from dihydro-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl (N-DBI), whereas spin-coating the BDPPV/N-DBI mixture allowed a σ of 14 S cm−1 and power factors up to 28 μW (m−1 K−2) in thin solid films. Kemerink and co-workers developed an inverse-sequential doping method for a C60 derivative using 4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-N,N-diphenylaniline (N-DPBI), resulting in a high power factor of 35 μW (m−1 K−2) under a high conductivity of 40 S cm−1 (Fig. 1b).51

Unlike the n-type thermoelectric materials, the p-type ones are abundant. They can generally be divided into two groups: poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-based materials (Fig. 2a) which are doped during the polymerization,57–65 and the others, which generally are nonconductive and can be molecularly doped after film formation.66,67

The high σ in highly doped PEDOT is responsible for its thermoelectric performance.68,69 The typical Seebeck coefficient is not high in this material with only 11 μV K−1 for in situ polymerized PEDOT thin films60 and ∼17 μV K−1 for PEDOT:PSS,33 and this is most likely to be because of the high carrier density in these materials.70,71 Some attempts were made to further improve the thermoelectric properties in these materials, such as controlling the carrier density inside the films, which is a typical approach in the field of inorganic thermoelectric materials.32,72,73 In their pioneering study, on the de-doping of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):tosylate (PEDOT:tos), Crispin and co-workers observed a figure-of-merit (ZT) of 0.25 primarily attributed to a high S (>200 μV K−1).32 In later studies, Crispin and co-workers highlighted the difficulties of in-plane thermal conductivity (κ) measurements.74 They accurately estimated the maximum ZT (0.11) for PEDOT:tos at an oxidation level of ∼22% at room temperature. A solid-state photoinduced charge-transfer reaction was used to precisely control the carrier density in PEDOT:PSS films. It was demonstrated that the Seebeck coefficient measured as a function of the irradiation time reveals a maximum power factor of ∼42 μW (m−1 K−2) at a carrier density of ∼5 × 1020 cm−3,75 whereas the estimated ZT was ∼0.02. Such an approach could provide a possible route to finely control and measure the doping density of a single device.
Other organic semiconductors could be chemically doped by exposing them to oxidative agents or acids such as Fe3+, I2, 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroquinodimethane (F4TCNQ), and toluenesulfonic acid after the film formation.66,67,76–82 For a high σ via molecular doping, both doping density and carrier mobility must be considered: a high concentration of dopants could generate more charges; moreover, it could affect the molecular packing and the morphology, decreasing the carrier mobility. Kang et al. developed a doping process by evaporating F4TCNQ molecules on top of a liquid crystal polymer poly(2,5-bis(3-hexadecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (PBTTT) layer, which allowed the polymer to retain its highly ordered lamellar microstructure with the dopant incorporated into the layer of side chains (Fig. 2b).83,84 This solid-state diffusion method allowed a σ that was considerably higher than 200 S cm−1. Patel et al. studied and compared the thermoelectric properties of (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)trichlorosilane (FTS) doped PBTTT and observed a better thermoelectric performance (with a Seebeck coefficient of ∼33 μV K−1 and a power factor of 100 μW (m−1 K−2)), exceeding that of films doped with 4-ethylbenzenesulfonic acid (Fig. 2c).85,86 Interestingly, this difference was not caused by local structure perturbations induced by the dopants but by changes in carrier scattering in the disordered regions of the film and probably the entropic vibrational component of the Seebeck coefficient. Furthermore, they compared the thermoelectric properties of a series of semiconducting polymers (with an σ of 10−5 to 1000 S cm−1) doped with either F4TCNQ or FTS, but did not identify any noticeable maximum in the power factor of these polymers unlike that which is typically observed for inorganic semiconductors.87
Hybrid materials using organic and inorganic thermoelectric materials have also been studied. There are several expected effects of using hybrid materials instead of conducting polymers or inorganic thermoelectric materials, such as improved electrical conductivity because of polymer ordering, and an increased Seebeck coefficient because of interface scattering and reduced thermal conductivity compared with inorganic thermoelectric materials. There are numerous studies of PEDOT/inorganic hybrid composites such as PEDOT/Te,88 PEDOT/PbTe,89 PEDOT/Bi2Te3,90 and PEDOT/Ge.91 It should be noted that both the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of the films could decrease if an homogeneous mixture of the materials cannot be obtained. This is because the carriers flow through each material independently.
3. Contact resistance
Thermoelectric devices can be fabricated by connecting the semiconductor in series or parallel using a metal electrode. In the process, the contact resistance between the conducting polymer and the metal electrode could substantially affect the device performance because it contributes to the internal resistance of the devices. However, studies exploring how the contact resistance affects the thermoelectric performance of the organic devices are rare.
The effect of the contact resistance on the thermoelectric conversion efficiency could be estimated using thermoelectric parameters from PEDOT:PSS to calculate the power output of one leg. Here, a flat interface is assumed and the thermoelectric power output of one leg of area A and thickness L is considered. Fig. 3a shows a schematic of the device used for the calculation.

When the metal electrode plates are connected to the upper and the lower sides of the element and temperature gradient ΔT is applied along the through-plane direction of the component, a maximum power density P is obtained from this equation: (1)where S is the Seebeck coefficient, R1 is the resistance of the element, and Rc is the contact resistance between the element and the metal electrodes. The electrical conductivity σ of PEDOT:PSS and the contact resistivity rc (Rc = rc/A) can be utilized to obtain: (2) (3)
From eqn (3), it can be seen that the power density of the device is not related to the contact area but the device thickness. In the simplified case, for 1D heat conduction, the thermal resistance K1 from the device can be represented as: (4)where κ is the thermal conductivity of the leg (here the thermal conductivity of PEDOT:PSS is used). The heat transfer efficiency at the air/device surface was assumed at hi = 100 W m−2 K−1 (moderate speed of air flow over a surface).92 Accordingly, the thermal resistance Ki at the device/air interface is: (5)
Considering that the temperature of the hot side was 100 °C and the environmental temperature was 20 °C: (6) (7) (8)
Then the Seebeck coefficient (S = 17 μV K−1) and electrical conductivity (σ = 800 S cm−1) of PEDOT:PSS could be used to estimate the maximum power density at a function of specific contact resistance rc (Rc = rc/A) at a given device thickness L (from 10 μm to 10 cm).

Fig. 3b shows that even when the same thermoelectric materials were used, there were obvious differences of orders of magnitude in the power output because of an increase in the contact resistivity. For a thin film device, the power density is normally reduced because of a small achievable temperature difference and high contact resistance, thus, a very low contact resistivity is required to raise their power density. For a device with a thickness of >1 mm, the power density gets saturated if the contact resistivity is <102 μΩ cm2. For example, a device with a thickness of ∼2 cm would show a higher power density because of the balance between ΔT and the internal resistance.
Previously, the transmission line method was used to measure the contact resistance between different types of metals and PEDOT:PSS films,93 and differences of orders of magnitude in the contact resistivity between the materials were observed. The metals with surface oxidation layers, including Ni, Al, and Cu, generally showed a higher contact resistivity, which is reasonable because the surface oxide acted as a barrier for carrier transport from the metal to the conducting polymer to subsequently increase the contact resistivity. The lowest contact resistivity between the metals and PEDOT:PSS was of the order of 104 μΩ cm2, suggesting that the device performance was still strongly affected by contact resistance (Fig. 3c). It should be noted that the power outputs of devices using PEDOT:PSS can be maximized using a thick (>1 cm) device. Therefore, the reported thermoelectric modules did not show the expected power outputs based on the material properties. In an inorganic thermoelectric system, rc is typically <102 μΩ cm2 because of the soldering technique that is used.
A surface treatment approach using ethylene glycol (EG) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on the electrode areas of the film could work to minimize the contact resistance,94 primarily because of an increase in the contact area between PEDOT:PSS and Ag particles (Fig. 3d). It is important to point out that reducing the carrier density in conducting polymers would mean an increased Seebeck coefficient and power factor, however, a device with a higher power output could not be successfully created because the contact resistance depends on the carrier density in the polymers. A lower carrier density in conducting polymers may increase the barrier at the interface and result in a higher contact resistivity. Studies to obtain a quantitative understanding of this trade-off relationship are underway.
4. Device structure
4.1 Thermal gradient parallel to the substrate
To use the advantages of solution processed organic materials, these materials can be printed on certain substrates and then they can be connected in parallel or series, and then a thermal gradient parallel to the substrate can be applied (Fig. 4a). This approach is ideal for simplifying production. With this process, the in-plane thermoelectric properties of the materials determine the device performance, which corresponds to the typical characterization direction of the film samples. Thus, with a fixed temperature difference between the two sides of the substrate, the device performance could be compared with the material properties. This helps in the understanding of the effect of contact resistance, and thus optimizing the fabrication process. However, in these devices, the substrates take up volume, indicating that the power density of these devices is not high.

In a previous study, PEDOT:PSS thermoelectric modules were fabricated on paper by screen printing (Fig. 4b).95 Here, the power output obtained for the large-area device was >50 μW at a ΔT of ∼100 K, which provided sufficient power to illuminate a light-emitting diode (LED). The PEDOT:PSS showed a remarkable thermal stability in the air, although the performance of the module decreased over time because of the unstable interface between the Ag paste and PEDOT:PSS. It was demonstrated that organic thermoelectric modules could be used to harvest heat energy at low temperatures, although the stability of the interfaces must be improved.
Fang and co-workers reported the fabrication of organic thermoelectric modules on a Kapton substrate comprising >100 p- and n-legs (Fig. 4c).96 A rolled module design is normally used in this approach to easily maintain a temperature gradient along the substrate direction. The rolled modules produced a power output of 46 μW at a temperature difference of 65 K. Furthermore, Yee and co-workers used PEDOT:PSS and poly(nickel-1,1,2,2-ethenetetrathiolate) to fabricate a disk-like radial thermoelectric module on paper (Fig. 4d).97,98 Using this device, a hot pipe could be accommodated as the heat source, thus active cooling was not required. The device produced an open-circuit voltage of 85 mV and a power density of 15 nW cm−2 under a temperature difference of 45 K.
4.2 Thermal gradient vertical to the substrate
In inorganic thermoelectric devices, this structure is typical and could contain both p-leg and n-leg to make π-type devices or include only p-leg/n-leg and metal to produce the so-called uni-leg devices (Fig. 5a).99 Crispin and co-workers first reported a π-type thermoelectric module based on PEDOT/Tos and tetrathiafulvalene–tetracyanoquinodimethane (TTF–TCNQ).32 The all-organic thermoelectric generator (TEG) device had 54 legs with lengths of 40 μm and was fabricated within a pre-patterned epoxy-based polymer cavity. It yielded a maximum power output of 0.128 μW at a temperature difference of 10 K (Fig. 5b). Søndergaard et al. demonstrated the large-scale fabrication of a uni-leg thermoelectric module using roll-to-roll printing technologies, which they claimed to be capable of >10000 serial connections (Fig. 5c).100

Suemori et al. used a printing process to fabricate a 150 μm-thick flexible thermoelectric generator on a polyethylene naphthalate film substrate (Fig. 5d),101 where the composite material was composed of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and polystyrene. Consisting of 1985 individual devices, the TEG generated ∼5.5 μW cm−2 of power at a temperature difference of 70 °C. Nonoguchi and co-workers reported a π-type 12 cm scale generator providing thermoelectric outputs which were high enough to drive an LED.102 Yee and co-workers suggested organic thermoelectric devices exhibiting an excellent performance by positioning n- and p-type legs in a closed-packed hexagonal layout.103 The technique can be performed using paper as a substrate, but roll-to-roll printing techniques are applicable (Fig. 5e).
Although such a thermal gradient structure is demonstrated in the field of inorganic thermoelectrics, directly applying it to organic thermoelectric materials can be difficult for several reasons. The first is the film thickness.104,105 A constant temperature gradient in π-type devices can be achieved with a typical film thickness of millimeters, which is a challenging task in solution processing. The second is the anisotropy of the film samples. For a film sample, it is easy to measure and compare the in-plane Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity, however, extracting the through-plane quantities is not straightforward. In π-type devices, the through-plane thermoelectric properties of the materials largely determine the device performance. As reported in previous work, the through-plane thermoelectric properties are lower than the in-plane properties.27,106,107
These issues may be overcome by considering the fabrication and transport properties of nonwoven fabric-composite thermoelectric elements via impregnation with the polymer PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 6a).108 Here, a high thermal resistance was attributed to the porous structure formed in the fabric after the solvent evaporation of the PEDOT:PSS solution. Moreover, the polymer films covering the surface of the fibers in the fabric connected the fibers to form electrical conduction paths, yielding isotropic electrical conductivity at high PEDOT:PSS concentrations (Fig. 6b). These two factors provided the optimum PEDOT:PSS concentration for the power density per PEDOT:PSS per amount of polymer content. It should be noted that optimizing the power density per amount of polymer content could contribute to the inexpensive fabrication of thermoelectric modules from conducting polymers (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, such a flexible device can be bonded on to a pipe surface to harvest energy from the fluid within the piping (Fig. 6d). The flexible thermoelectric module fabricated from the nonwoven fabric-composite achieved a power output which was sufficient to power an LED (Fig. 6e). Contact electrical resistance at the polymer–electrode junctions was significantly reduced as the contact area widened because of the wavy surface of the fabric composite. Indeed, this approach provides a new method for making isotropic conducting samples from anisotropic materials.

4.3 Substrate-free devices
As discussed in the previous section, printing organic materials on substrates is a straightforward approach to fabricate devices. However, as the substrates take up volume, the power density of these devices would not be high. The substrate volume can be minimized with use of organic thermoelectric modules by laminating free-standing PEDOT:PSS films, polyimide, and Ni foil (Fig. 7).93,109
 Fig. 7  A schematic diagram of the thermal lamination process used to fabricate the polymer thermoelectric devices. The Ni foil was cut into a square and modified into an L-shape. The edges on both sides were coated with 20 nm of Au. The as-prepared Ni foils, polyimide films, and freestanding PEDOT/PSS films were stacked within a mold for alignment and laminated at 100 °C. Reprinted with permission from ref. 109, copyright 2019 American Chemical Society. 
In Section 3, it was reported that a thick device (with a thickness of ∼2 cm) is necessary to maximize the power density using PEDOT:PSS, primarily because of a relatively high contact resistivity at the interface. Here the device height was fixed at 2.2 cm according to the commercial availability of the precision film cutter (Nogamigiken Co., Ltd.).
Accordingly, the thicknesses of the PEDOT:PSS film, the polyimide film, and the Ni foil were fixed at 50, 7, and 5 μm, respectively. The 5 μm thick Ni foil and 7 μm thick polyimide film are the minimum thicknesses applicable commercially. The PEDOT:PSS film was imparted with high electrical conductivity by adding high boiling point solvent: EG, which improved the crystallinity and ordering of the PEDOT nanocrystals during film formation. An increase in the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS film decreased the order of the PEDOT nanocrystals, resulting in a lower electrical conductivity.
A relatively large contact area between PEDOT:PSS and Ni was required for the high contact resistance between the metals and the conducting polymers. Furthermore, it was necessary to consider the heat lost at the contact area. To match the thermal resistance between Ni and PEDOT:PSS and improve the device performance, the volume of Ni was reduced by altering the shape of the Ni foil into an I-shape (Fig. 8a) whereas the width and height of the device was fixed at 22 mm. The device efficiency was calculated by altering the contact area between PEDOT:PSS and Ni (a), as well as the width of the Ni foil (b). As shown in Fig. 8b, the effective thermal resistance, 1/κc of the contact area between PEDOT:PSS and Ni on both sides, and the thermal resistance of the active area, 1/(κp + κn + κi), were assumed to be connected in series.

Considering one p–n pair, the device efficiency was approximately: (9)Here, Z′ is defined as follows: (10)where S is the Seebeck coefficient, R is the electrical resistance, and K is the thermal conductance, with the subscripts p and n denoting the p-type and n-type materials, respectively. The Rc and Ki are the corresponding contact resistance and thermal loss from the insulation layer, respectively. The values of Z′ could be maximized to obtain the best thermoelectric device performance, as shown by the calculation results in Fig. 8c. Z′ increased as b significantly decreased, which could be attributed to a decrease in the thermal conductance of Ni. The optimum value of b was ∼2 mm, whereas a b value of <2 mm resulted in increased electrical resistance and thus a low Z′. The optimal value of a was ∼3 mm, although the changes in Z′ as a varied from 2 to 4 mm were not significant. When a decreased to <1 mm, the contact resistance between PEDOT:PSS and Au–Ni increased significantly, whereas a value of a exceeding 5 mm resulted in a low intrinsic temperature difference. Both caused Z′ to significantly decrease.
The thermoelectric device was fabricated with a = b = ∼2 mm. At a hot source temperature of 100 °C, it achieved a stable temperature difference of 50 K under natural cooling conditions without any heat sink (Fig. 9a). Its corresponding power density was as high as 40 μW cm−2 (Fig. 9b). In our laboratory, a typical area for the device is ∼5 cm2, which contains ∼300 legs. The average weight of the device was only 10 g, which indicates that it could continuously deliver 0.2 mW for practical applications.

4.4 Flexible devices considering anisotropy
It is necessary to consider anisotropy in materials when fabricating flexible devices so that the heat flow is transferred from a vertical direction to a horizontal direction (Fig. 10a). This concept is known in the field of inorganic thermoelectrics but is not generally applied in organic materials. Takeda and co-workers reported the fabrication of inorganic thermoelectric devices on a flexible substrate composed of polyimide and copper sheets.110,111 The flexible substrate was formed of high and low thermal conductivity materials. When the device was placed on a hot source, the vertical heat flow transferred to a horizontal direction. Experimentally, it was confirmed that the temperature difference (ΔTout) applied between the outer surfaces of the device could transfer to an in-plane temperature difference (ΔTin), measured at 16.7 K when ΔTout was 57.8 K, which is consistent with the values obtained using the finite element method.111

The inset shows a photograph of the TE module consisting of a p-type CNT-based composite material. The TE module can achieve a maximum power output of 120 μW when the hot side is 120 °C and the flow rate of cool air is 3.9 m s−1.

Fujifilm featured a similar in-plane configuration using a p-type CNT with a flexible single-leg type thermoelectric module (10 × 10 cm2) (Fig. 10b and c).112 The thermoelectric module was mounted onto an Al fin with flowing air for cooling, and then the heat was extracted from a hot pipe with a diameter of 80 mm. The power output was measured at different airflow rates in the range of 0–3.9 m s−1. Based on these results, the module generated a power output of 10 μW by natural air cooling when the hot-side temperature was 120 °C, but remarkably could increase to 50 and 120 μW when the airflow rates were 1.2 and 3.9 m s−1, respectively.
Because organic materials generally have a lower in-plane thermal conductivity than inorganic semiconductors and CNT, a larger ΔTin could be expected when using a similar design.106 The fabrication of a flexible device using PEDOT:PSS and electroplating Ni film is currently a greatly researched topic.
5. DC-to-DC converter and self-powered sensors
Commercial sensors operate at a typical voltage of several volts, but thermoelectric devices cannot provide a high open-circuit voltage (tens of mV to hundreds of mV). Thus, a DC-to-DC converter is necessary to fabricate self-powered sensors.113
There are different types of DC-to-DC converters commercially available. One important parameter when evaluating a DC-to-DC converter is the minimum input voltage required to operate the converter. A LTC3108 (Linear Technology) DC-to-DC converter is extensively used in inorganic thermoelectric modules,114 because it can use a voltage as low as 20 mV, which is achievable for many inorganic thermoelectric modules, however, this converter requires a low internal resistance. The experimental results for operating this converter with different thermoelectric devices and thermoelectrochemical devices are shown in Table 1. For the device with an internal resistance of 1.5 Ω, the converter could be driven with an open-circuit voltage of ∼33 mV. If the internal resistance increased to 10 Ω, a higher open-circuit voltage of 70 mV was required. For a device with an internal resistance of 150 Ω, an open-circuit voltage of 450 mV was required to boost the charge pump. From the datasheet, a milliampere scale current was required to boost LTC3108, which is about the same as the measurement results. Another DC-to-DC converter that was tested was the AP4470 (Asahi Kasei Microdevices). It could only be driven with an open-circuit voltage of >200 mV but needs a small current. Based on these experiment results with organic thermoelectric devices, it was possible to start to boost AP4470 even when the internal resistance was more significant than 10000 Ω if the open-circuit voltage could achieve 500 mV.

For the organic thermoelectric devices, it was not easy to achieve a low internal resistance because of the limitation of film thickness, the relatively low electrical conductivity of organic materials, and the relatively high contact resistance. Thus, we fabricated the self-powered sensors by combining the laminated device with AP4470 and a BLE sensor (Cypress) (Fig. 11a). As the BLE sensor is initially designed for solar cells, the solar cells were removed and the sensor was operated with the DC-to-DC converter. The size of the organic thermoelectric module was ∼2.2 × 5 × 2.2 cm3. On a 100 °C hot source, the module delivered ∼0.2 mW to boost the DC-to-DC converter. It should be noted that the maximum power output from the module was ∼0.4 mW at the optimal load.

The self-powered sensor transferred the humidity and temperature signal to a tablet, PC, or smartphone every 5 s to 10 min. The humidity and temperature were monitored in the laboratory for over 70 days (the hot side temperature was fixed at 100 °C all the time), and the corresponding changes recorded day and night. The temperature in the room stabilized after the air conditioner in the room was turned on (Fig. 11b).
Both the current (Fig. 11c) and voltage (Fig. 11d) changes were measured with time on the DC-to-DC converter. Firstly, the thermoelectric module delivered more power when the room temperature was reduced, and this was because a more significant temperature difference was achieved inside the device. Secondly, the BLE sensor/DC-to-DC showed some tendency to switch off when no more power was required, therefore, there was a reversed change of the current and voltage on the converters. It is essential to report that no significant degeneration of the voltage or the current occurred in the 70 days, even without encapsulation of the devices. It should be noted that the stability test was terminated because of Covid-19, although a much longer life was expected. Previous studies have shown that the performance of the printed module decreased over time, which was attributed to the unstable interface between the silver paste and the PEDOT:PSS. It is expected that selecting the right interface material could significantly increase the stability of the devices. Moreover, other modules which were fabricated one year ago were tested and no significant difference in the power output was observed when they were compared to the freshly prepared ones. It is confidently expected that the organic thermoelectric module could show excellent stability that would even be comparable to those of inorganic thermoelectric materials.
6. Conclusions
This study summarized recent efforts concerning the fabrication of organic thermoelectric devices. It was demonstrated that the thermoelectric performance of organic semiconductors is still less than those of their inorganic counterparts, however, the devices could achieve respectable power outputs through device engineering. Furthermore, the organic thermoelectric devices possess other advantages, such as being lightweight. For example, a device containing ∼300 legs weighs only 10 g, which indicates that it could continuously deliver power of 0.2 mW at a hot-side temperature of 100 °C under natural cooling without a heat sink. Stability issues are another concern for the practical application of organic thermoelectric modules because energy harvesting devices face competition from batteries, which are known to have high energy densities and long lifetimes. It was demonstrated that a self-powered sensor based on an organic thermoelectric module could show excellent stability over 70 days under continuous working conditions. No significant performance degeneration was observed during the period, and no covering was applied to the devices. This result is encouraging, thus, it is suggested that organic thermoelectric materials could be ideal candidates for energy harvesting and the fabrication of self-powered sensors. Using newly developed organic conducting materials, it is expected that more thermoelectric devices with high added value will be fabricated.
