    , Accepted 20th September 2019First published on 20th September 2019AbstractAqueous electrochemical energy storage devices have advantages in terms of high safety, low cost, and environmental benignity, yet a major drawback is the low energy density compared to those using organic electrolytes. Here, we report an aqueous Zn-ion hybrid energy storage device (ZIHESD) using poly(4,4′-thiodiphenol, TDP)-modified nanoporous activated carbon (AC) as the cathode material. The introduction of this redox-active polymer can largely enhance the energy storage capacity. Compared to the Zn//AC cell, the use of the poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cathode leads to not only a wide voltage window, as broadened from 0.2–1.8 V to 0.1–1.9 V, but also an approximately three-fold increased areal capacity. The capacity retention is 71% after 2000 cycles. Also, a group of ZIHESDs with different AC mass loadings in the cathode are tested. A maximum areal capacity of 1.16 mA h cm−2 is achieved. Furthermore, a flexible quasi-solid-state cell encapsulated in a flat pouch shows stable electrochemical performance when repeatedly bent at large angles. The cell shows sustained powering capability after being partially cut by using scissors. The energy storage mechanism is discussed in detail.
Introduction
There has been an urgent demand for the development of alternative clean energy sources, such as wind, solar, and ocean energy, to tackle the energy crisis across the world.1,2 Nevertheless, these renewable energy sources are intermittent by nature, which requires energy storage systems as an intermediate station between the energy harvester and consumer. Electrochemical energy storage devices play a vital role in our daily life, and their sizes vary in a large range. From the bulky ones for grid energy storage to the miniature ones for electronic gadgets, the energy storage performances in terms of energy density, rate performance, and cycling life are determined by the type of electrode material and the related manufacturing technology. According to the energy storage mechanism, rechargeable energy storage devices can be classified as batteries and supercapacitors.3,4 In general, a secondary battery has a high energy density but suffers from a low power density. Also, it takes hours for a full charge. A supercapacitor can be charged quickly, able to provide a high power output, and has a super long cycling life, but has inferior energy density because the charge storage relies on physical adsorption of ions onto the electrode surface. With the development of new electrochemical energy storage systems, devices with a hybrid energy storage mechanism have emerged.
Significant research efforts have been devoted to developing high performance supercapacitors by combining a battery-like electrode and a supercapacitor-like electrode, and the device named a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) has merits of both ionic batteries and conventional supercapacitors. For example, lithium-ion,5 sodium-ion,6 and potassium-ion HSCs have been reported.7 These devices generally use organic electrolytes that lead to wide potential windows. Besides, aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors based on two dissimilar electrode materials were also reported.8–11 The asymmetric design is to widen the potential window beyond the water splitting point at ∼1.23 V.12 Though the use of aqueous electrolytes brings about advantages like low cost, easy fabrication, high safety, and high ion mobility, the major drawback is the low energy density compared to the counterparts of Li-ion batteries using organic electrolytes. Therefore, it is imperative to devise a new aqueous energy storage system that has both wide potential window and high capacity.
Very recently, aqueous Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors using a Zn anode and a porous activated carbon (AC) based cathode were reported.13–16 These devices rely on the physical adsorption of Zn ions onto the surfaces of AC to store charge, and the operating voltage was in the range of 0.2–1.8 V. Though the divalent Zn2+ ions carry more charges than monovalent ions such as H+, Na+, and Li+ which are often used in other types of aqueous supercapacitors, the physical adsorption of ions is inadequate to offer a high specific capacitance, limiting the specific energy. Herein, we report a novel aqueous Zn-ion hybrid energy storage device (ZIHESD) based on a Zn anode and a polymer-based cathode. In our work, a pseudocapacitive polymer, poly(4,4′-TDP), was electrodeposited onto porous AC to prepare the cathode, which was combined with a Zn anode to construct aqueous ZIHESDs. Electrode materials for Zn ion based rechargeable cells can be classified as inorganics and organics.17–20 The inorganic ones represented by metal oxides or carbides have high resistance, hence a low mass loading of such an electrode material is preferred to reduce the internal resistance. Aqueous Zn//MnO2 and Zn//V2O5 cells are charged/discharged within voltage ranges of 1.0–1.8 V and 0.2–1.6 V, respectively.21,22 In our work, not only high mass loadings can be achieved from the poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cathode, which show high areal capacities of up to 1.16 mA h cm−2, but also a broad voltage range, 0.1–1.9 V, is achieved by using the poly(4,4′-TDP) cathode.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a illustrates the process for fabricating a Zn//poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cell. First, carbon fiber cloth was coated with nanoporous AC by using the slurry-coating method. Second, poly(4,4′-TDP) was electrodeposited onto the AC coating in a three-electrode cell. Third, the poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cathode and the Zn foil anode were assembled together with an in-between glass fiber membrane soaked with 2 M ZnSO4 aqueous electrolyte. Fig. 1b shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the AC coating on carbon cloth. These AC granules are about several micrometers in size. After the electrodeposition of poly(4,4′-TDP), the morphology of the AC coating is depicted in Fig. 1c. The as-synthesized AC product has a high specific surface area of ∼2280 m2 g−1 (Fig. S1a†), and each AC granule has numerous randomly-oriented nanopores with sizes of 1–3 nm. The AC coating that contains 10 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride as the binder and 10 wt% carbon black has a specific surface area of 1820 m2 g−1 (Fig. S1b†). After the electrodeposition of poly(4,4′-TDP), the specific surface area of the poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC composite coating is reduced to 1030 m2 g−1 (Fig. S1c†). Hence, the remaining surface area of AC is believed to provide electric double-layer capacitance. In the high-magnification SEM image in Fig. 1d, it can be seen that the poly(4,4′-TDP) coating is in the form of inter-connected nanoparticles with sizes of around 100 nm. In addition, we used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to study the surface chemistry of the poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cathode. Fig. 1e, f, and g show high-resolution XPS C 1s, O 1s, and S 2p spectra of the sample, respectively. The emergence of the S signal confirms the presence of poly(4,4′-TDP). In Fig. 1e, the deconvoluted C 1s peak reveals C–C, C–O, and CO bonds. For the O 1s peak in Fig. 1f, it can be deconvoluted into two speaks at 532.9 and 531.7 eV, corresponding to C–H–O and C–O bonds, respectively.

Fig. 2a shows cyclic voltammetry (CV) loops at different voltage scan rates collected from a typical Zn//poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cell with an AC mass loading of 3.7 mg cm−2 in the cathode. Within the voltage range of 0.1–1.9 V, during the charging process, two oxidation peaks emerged in the CV curve, as shown in Fig. 2b. Without the presence of poly(4,4′-TDP), the Zn//AC cell can be regarded as a hybrid supercapacitor and its suitable voltage range is 0.2–1.8 V. Besides, the area of the CV loop is much smaller, as shown in Fig. 2b, indicating a lower capacitance. Hence, we conclude that the introduction of poly(4,4′-TDP) into the AC-based cathode not only widens the voltage window but also increases the capacitance, owing to the added faradaic process for energy storage. Fig. 2d shows galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curves of the Zn//poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cell at different current densities, according to which a maximum areal capacity of 0.85 mA h cm−2 is deduced. If a bare AC coating of 3.7 mg cm−2 is used as the cathode to match with the Zn anode, the areal capacitance of AC at 0.3 A g−1 is 0.38 mA h cm−2, corresponding to 102 mA h g−1 (Fig. S2†). This is equivalent to that of another AC product in a previous report (107 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1).14 After the electrodeposition of poly(4,4′-TDP), the mass gain was 2.5 mg cm−2 and the areal capacitance increased from 0.38 to 0.85 mA h cm−2. Therefore, the specific capacity of poly(4,4′-TDP) can be roughly calculated to be 188 mA h g−1 by using ΔC/Δm, where ΔC is the capacity gain and Δm is the net weight of the electrodeposited polymer. In this regard, the more poly(4,4′-TDP) over AC granules, the higher the specific capacity. However, the amount of electrodeposited poly(4,4′-TDP) would reach a saturation level if the number of CV cycles for electropolymerization in a three-electrode cell is beyond 80, as shown in Fig. S3a.† Therefore, for all samples in this study poly(4,4′-TDP) was electrodeposited for 80 CV cycles. For two cathodes with poly(4,4′-TDP) electrodeposited for 20 and 80 CV cycles, the latter one showed an apparently higher capacity after being integrated into a Zn-ion cell, as shown in Fig. S3b.† The carbon fiber fabric as the current collector may provide EDL capacitance, but it is negligible compared to that of the AC coating, as shown in Fig. 2b. The cycling life of a rechargeable battery or supercapacitor is an important issue for practical application. We tested the cycling performance of the as-fabricated device by running a GCD test at 8 mA cm−2 for 2000 cycles, and the result is shown in Fig. 2c. The initial specific capacitance of this cell was 0.49 mA h cm−2, and it decreased to 0.35 mA h cm−2 after the cycling process, indicating a capacity retention of 71%. Such a value is fairly good compared to Li-ion or lead–acid batteries. The coulombic efficiency remained stable at 99% during the long-term cycling process.

Energy and power densities of some other devices ever reported are shown. 
From a practical point of view, a high mass loading of the electrode material is always required to render high capacity. We prepared a group of Zn//poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cells with different AC mass loadings in the cathode, ranging from 3.2 to 6 mg cm−2. Note that the mass gain of electrodeposited poly(4,4′-TDP) is also a function of the AC mass loading. For the cathode with an AC mass loading of 6 mg cm−2, the net weight of poly(4,4′-TDP) is ∼2.5 mg cm−2, and thus the overall mass loading of the poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC composite is ∼8.5 mg cm−2. The rate performances of these devices are shown in Fig. 2e. A trend is that the higher the mass loading of the cathode material, the higher the capacity. However, the capacity would reach a saturation level when the AC mass loading is beyond 5.0 mg cm−2. It can be understood that the permeation depth of electrodeposited poly(4,4′-TDP) in an AC coating is limited, and thus the net weight of poly(4,4′-TDP) and the capacity would reach a saturation level if the thickness of the AC coating is beyond a certain value. For the device with an AC mass loading of 6 mg cm−2 in the cathode, a maximum areal capacity of 1.2 mA h cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 is achieved. Remarkably, even at 10 mA cm−2, a capacity of 0.85 mA h cm−2 is retained, about 74% of the maximum capacity. The capacity recovered to 1.1 mA h cm−2 when the current density dropped from 10 to 1 mA cm−2, showing good rate performance. Fig. 2f shows Ragone plots of this group of devices. The cell with the thickest AC coating in the cathode shows the highest areal energy density of 1.03 mW h cm−2, corresponding to a power density of 0.9 mW cm−2. For comparison, energy and power densities of some other HSCs that were reported previously are provided as well in Fig. 2g. Examples include Ag@Ni0.67Co0.33S//C (0.36 mW h cm−2),23 Ni3S2@CdS//C (0.26 mW h cm−2),24 Co0.67Ni0.33 LDH/NiCo2O4//AC (0.32 mW h cm−2),25 Mn1−xNixCo2O4//AC (0.14 mW h cm−2),26 Ni–Co–S nanoflakes//polypyrrole (0.11 mW h cm−2),27 Zn-PTO (0.83 mW h cm−2),28 Ni0.8Cu0.2S//N-doped graphene (0.14 mW h cm−2),29 and Zn-PANI (0.2 mW h cm−2).30 Apparently, our ZIHESDs surpass most other hybrid supercapacitors in terms of both energy and power densities.
To realize different applications, several cells can be connected either in series to boost the voltage or in parallel to multiply the capacity. The GCD curves in Fig. 3a were collected from a single cell and two cells in parallel, respectively. When at an identical current, the discharge time of two cells in parallel is nearly double that of a single cell, indicating doubled capacity because of the parallel connection. In Fig. 3b, the two cells in series can be charged within a wide voltage window from 0.1 V to 3.8 V, which is twice as wide as that of a single cell. Note that carbon cloth used as the current collector is highly conductive and flexible. Some researchers used carbon cloth as the base to fabricate Li–I or Li–S batteries, without demonstrating the device flexibility.31,32 We fabricated quasi-solid-state Zn//poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cells with using a gelled electrolyte and studied the effect of device bending on the electrochemical performance. The electrolyte was prepared by mixing gelatin with 2 M ZnSO4 solution. Fig. 3c shows the cycling performance of a typical flexible device at different bending angles. During the cycling process, the flat device was bent at 60°, 120°, and 180°, and then released to the initial status. It can be seen that both capacity and coulombic efficiency of the device remained stable, regardless of bending. Impressively, after repeatedly bending and releasing the device for 50 cycles, the capacity retention was ∼98%. Therefore, our flexible ZIHESD has the potential for wearable electronics, which requires high-standard safety of the energy storage component. In order to demonstrate the high safety, we used ceramic scissors to cut the pouch cell while it was working. As shown in Fig. 3d, the ZIHESD kept powering an electronic watch after being partially cut. As a demonstration of practical application, Fig. 3e shows a mini electric fan powered up by two flexible ZIHESDs in series.

To elucidate the effect of poly(4,4′-TDP) on broadening the voltage window of the Zn-ion cell, we measured the CV loops within different voltage windows for a bare AC coating and a poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC coating in a three-electrode cell filled with 1 M H2SO4, and the results are shown in Fig. S4.† Upon using a Pt counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, the suitable voltage range for the AC electrode is −0.2–0.8 V (Fig. S4a†), while that for poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC can be widened to be −0.6–1.1 V (Fig. S4b†). We speculate that ion insertion in poly(4,4′-TDP) is responsible for the broadened voltage window. In the H2SO4 electrolyte, H+ would be intercalated into the poly(4,4′-TDP) coating when the voltage is below −0.2 V, suppressing the evolution of H2. During the charging process, anions such as SO42− and OH− move towards the poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC electrode. Meanwhile, H+ ions are extracted from the polymer molecules, causing an oxidation peak at ∼0.5 V over the CV curve due to the conversion from –OH to O. When the voltage is beyond 0.8 V, the released H+ from poly(4,4′-TDP) is combined with OH− at the interface, inhibiting the evolution of O2 until the voltage reaches ∼1.1 V. At the opposite Pt counter electrode, water molecules gain electrons and are decomposed to release H2 and OH− into the electrolyte to balance positive and negative charges. Since the poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC electrode can lead to a much wider voltage window than the bare AC electrode in H2SO4, when it is combined with a Zn anode in a two-electrode cell filled with ZnSO4, the voltage window would be also wider than that of the Zn//AC cell, owing to the cation insertion in the cathode. In Fig. S5,† the two CV loops were collected from a beaker-based Zn//poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cell using ZnCl2 and ZnSO4 electrolytes, respectively. Both CV loops exhibit two oxidation peaks and two reduction peaks, indicating a similar redox behavior of the cathode in either ZnCl2 or ZnSO4 electrolytes. Therefore, the oxidation of polymer molecules by SO42− is ruled out. However, the CV loop corresponding to the ZnCl2 electrolyte exhibits obvious polarization when the voltage approaches 1.9 V. Presumably, the relatively small Cl− ions are intercalated into the polymer coating and block the deintercalation of H+, leading to the evolution of O2 on the cathode surface when at 1.9 V.
To gain an insight into the energy storage mechanism of our ZIHESD, ex situ XPS spectra were collected from the poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cathode at charged (1.9 V) and discharged (0.1 V) states in the second cycle, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4a. For this measurement, the cathode after being charged or discharged in a beaker-based two-electrode system was immediately isolated and a small piece was cut off by using ceramic scissors. The cathode piece was rinsed with using deionized water and dried for XPS measurement. Similarly, ex situ Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the cathode at different charge states were collected (Fig. S7†), but the difference between charged and discharged poly(4,4′-TDP) molecules is not unveiled by these measurements. In the two XPS survey spectra, the F 1s signal is contributed by polyvinylidene fluoride used as the binder in the AC coating. Besides the common C 1s and O 1s peaks, other XPS peaks are contributed by Zn and S. However, as shown in Fig. 4b, this polymer cathode at the fully discharged state shows stronger Zn and S peaks than at the fully discharged state. In Fig. 4c, the Zn 2p peaks of the fully discharged cathode are deconvolved, revealing two components with a 3:1 ratio in area. This is related to the formation of Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O according to a previous report.30Fig. 4d and e show low- and high-magnification SEM images of the poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cathode at the fully charged state. Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O flakes cannot be found due to the negligible amount after the second cycle. Further energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental mappings for C, S, and Zn distributions in this sample, as shown in Fig. 4f, reveal trace amounts of Zn but distinct S signals mainly contributed by the electrodeposited polymer. Fig. 4g and h show low- and high-magnification SEM images of the poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cathode at the fully discharged state, respectively. Apparently, Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O flakes with sizes of several micrometers can be found. In Fig. 4i, the elemental mappings reveal much Zn along with C and S. It can be understood that during the charging/discharging process, cations and anions in the electrolyte move along opposite directions. The freshly assembled cell has an open circuit voltage of ∼1.1 V. Therefore, when the cell is charged, SO42− and OH− in the electrolyte are driven to the cathode. Zn2+ ions in the electrolyte are simultaneously electrodeposited onto the Zn foil anode. When discharged from 1.9 V to 0.1 V, SO42− and Zn2+ that move in opposite directions may encounter each other, facilitating the formation of Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O flakes via the reaction:4Zn2+ + 6OH− + SO2−4 + 5H2O ⇔ Zn4(OH)6SO4·5H2O↓

(i) SEM image and the corresponding C, S, and Zn elemental mappings of the cathode at the discharged state. 
It has been pointed out that the formation of Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O is partly reversible, due to the change of the pH value of the electrolyte during the charging/discharging process.14 Not only the cathode, but also the Zn foil anode is covered with Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O flakes after a long-term cycling test, as shown in Fig. S9.† However, the remaining Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O flakes after 2000 cycles are smaller than those after the second cycle, presumably attributed to the electrochemical milling during the long-term cycling process.
The charge storage mechanism of the Zn//poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cell is illustrated in Fig. 5. The poly(4,4′-TDP) molecular chain contains redox-active carbonyl groups that are responsible for charge storage. It should be addressed that the open voltage of a freshly assembled Zn//poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cell is ∼1.1 V, and the 2 M ZnSO4 electrolyte is a bit acidic (pH ∼ 5.4). Hence, in the first discharge cycle Zn2+ and H+ would move towards the cathode. As aforementioned that the poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC electrode was also tested in a three-electrode cell filled with 1 M H2SO4, and the interaction between H+ and this polymer is responsible for its pseudocapacitance as well as the widened voltage window, we believe that the coinsertion of Zn2+ and H+ would occur, causing a pair of reduction peaks as shown in Fig. 2b. A previous report on Zn//MnO2 batteries showed that both Zn2+ and H+ could be inserted into MnO2, causing two voltage plateaus in the discharge curve.21 In our work, the two voltage plateaus are obscure but the two reduction peaks over the CV curve are evident in Fig. 2b. As illustrated in Fig. 5 and by the 3D molecular geometry in Fig. S8,† a Zn2+ would be coordinately bound to two neighboring –O−, and an H+ would be bound to an isolated O to form –OH. When the cathode is charged from 0.1 to 1.9 V, the extraction of Zn2+ would first occur to cause the first oxidation peak, as this bivalent ion experiences a stronger electrostatic force and the binding force between Zn2+ and –O− is weak. Second, H+ ions are released from –OH groups of poly(4,4′-TDP) molecules upon increasing the voltage, and the continuous extraction of H+ after the second oxidation peak position (∼1.65 V) leads to a high voltage limit of 1.9 V. In the following discharging process, as cations and anions encounter at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte, the electrostatic interaction would make them combined, facilitating the growth of Zn4(OH)6SO4·5H2O flakes. The released H+ at a higher charging voltage also has a function of etching away these byproduct flakes over the cathode surface. This accounts for the phenomenon that in the first few cycles, Zn4(OH)6SO4·5H2O flakes emerged over a discharged cathode but nearly disappeared when the cathode was fully charged.

Conclusion
In summary, we fabricated aqueous ZIHESDs by using a poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cathode to match with the Zn foil anode for enhancing the energy storage capacity. The redox-active polymer that is electrodeposited onto nanoporous AC granules has an effect of not only widening the voltage window but also boosting the areal energy density of the device, achieving a wide operating voltage range of 0.1–1.9 V and a high capacity of 1.16 mA h cm−2. The maximum energy and power densities are 1.03 mW h cm−2 and 9.0 mW cm−2, respectively. Therefore, our ZIHESD has merits of both ionic batteries and supercapacitors. In addition, we fabricated quasi-solid-state ZIHESDs that show stable electrochemical performance when bent at large angles. Even after being partially cut by using scissors, the cell shows sustained powering capability. As a demonstration of practical application, two ZIHESDs in series were used to power a mini electric fan. We conclude that both Zn2+ and H+ can be bound to the carbonyl groups of poly(4,4′-TDP) molecules, and the alternate insertion and extraction of H+ play a key role in rendering a wide voltage window. Our study suggests a new way to fabricate high-performance aqueous rechargeable Zn-ion cells by combining appropriate redox-active polymers with nanoporous AC to fabricate the cathode.
Experimental section
To fabricate a poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cathode, a slurry made by dispersing AC powder (YP-80, Kuraray Co.), carbon black, and polyvinylidene fluoride at a weight ratio of 8:1:1 into N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent was applied onto a piece of carbon fiber fabric. After a drying process, the AC-coated carbon fabric used as the working electrode was immersed into a three-electrode cell filled with an acidic solution containing 1 M H2SO4 and 0.03 M 4,4′-TDP small molecules. By using a Pt foil counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, electropolymerization was conducted by performing a CV test at 20 mV s−1 within the voltage window of −0.3–1.2 V for 80 cycles. Finally, the obtained poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC electrode was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The net weight of electrodeposited poly(4,4′-TDP) was measured by using an analytical balance with a resolution of 0.01 mg.
The soft-packaged aqueous Zn//poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cell was assembled by stacking a poly(4,4′-TP)/AC cathode, a glass fiber separator, and a Zn foil anode together. The separator was soaked with 2 M ZnSO4 aqueous electrolyte. The whole cell was sealed into an Al-plastic film pouch using hot melting glue. For the quasi-solid-state Zn//poly(4,4′-TDP)/AC cell, gelatin was added to the aqueous electrolyte. The assembled device was left under ambient conditions for 1 h for partially drying and then sealed. Electrochemical measurements were performed on a Corrtest CS2150H electrochemical workstation. GCD tests were performed on a LAND CT3001A battery testing system at room temperature.
