    , Accepted 22nd November 2016First published on 29th November 2016AbstractSpectral adjustment based on the energy transfer process between donor–acceptor pairs has been routinely used to design luminescent materials with different colours and absorption bandwidths. This work reports an alternative way to design new luminescent materials based on a site-selected energy transfer mechanism using high precision control of dopants. The new material Sr2SiO4:Eu2+,Pr3+ has been successfully synthesized to show versatile emissions under site-selected excitation. We demonstrate an efficient site-selected energy transfer process from Eu2+ to Pr3+ and that dual-mode spectral control can be achieved by choosing Eu2+ in Sr2SiO4 as a yellow emission centre and Pr3+ as a red and near infrared emission centre. Therefore a yellow-to-orange phosphor has been realized with excitation-dependent adjustable red and near infrared emissions. The site-selected spectral adjustments and energy transfer mechanism are investigated in detail. This work suggests the design and synthesis of new materials for application in solar cells and white LED devices.
Introduction
The design of rare earth ion doped downshift (DS) luminescent materials with various emission wavelengths has been motivated by their extensive applications in lighting, displays, photovoltaics and bioimaging devices.1–5 To design DS phosphors doped with rare earth ions, energy transfer (ET) between suitable donor–acceptor (D–A) pairs in hosts is often established to realize spectral conversion properties.6,7 For instance, DS materials with absorption in the ultraviolet (UV)-visible (VIS) region and near infrared (NIR) emission around 1000 nm are often established using Ce3+–Yb3+ as the D–A pair, in which the ET process occurs between Ce3+–Yb3+.8,9 For DS phosphors with VIS light emission, Eu2+ or Ce3+ ions with strong broad band 4f–5d transition absorptions are widely used as the donors and Tb3+ or Mn4+ ions are used as the acceptors with green or red emissions.10–12 Many studies have investigated the optical properties and ET processes of D–A pairs.13 However, materials designed through ET process-based site-adjustments are rarely investigated.14
In this paper, we investigated the site-occupation conditions of Eu2+ and Pr3+ ions in a Sr2SiO4 host, and based on the design of rare earth ion occupation in different sites in the Sr2SiO4 matrix, we realized ET from Eu2+ to Pr3+. On the one hand, light conversion from blue light to orange light was achieved by using the new Sr2SiO4:Eu2+,Pr3+ material as a yellow phosphor, successfully meeting the need for red emission in white LED devices, and the white light emission LED devices are packaged. Meanwhile, through taking advantage of the controllable ET between Eu2+ and Pr3+ in different sites, light conversion from UV-blue light to NIR light was also successfully realized, which could have potential for application in solar cells.
Experimental section
The powder samples of Sr2SiO4:Eu2+, Sr2SiO4:Pr3+ and Sr2SiO4:Eu2+,Pr3+ were prepared by a solid-state reaction. Stoichiometric amounts of the raw materials SrCO3 (A.R.), SiO2 (A.R.), Eu2O3 (99.99%), and Pr6O11 (99.9%) were weighed and thoroughly mixed using an agate mortar. Then the mixture was transferred into a crucible and sintered at 1300–1500 °C for 5–6 h under a N2/H2 atmosphere in a horizontal tube furnace.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Bruker D8 advance X-ray diffractometer using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å, 40 kV, and 40 mA) at room temperature. High quality XRD data for Rietveld refinement was collected with a 2θ range from 10° to 100° at intervals of 0.02°. X-ray Rietveld refinements of the structural models and analyses were performed using the TOPAS-Academic program.15,16 Diffuse reflection spectra (DRS) were measured on a Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.) equipped with a double out-of-plane Littrow monochromator. The UV-Vis-NIR photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra at 4 K and room temperature (RT) were determined on an FSP920-combined Steady State Fluorescence Spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments), equipped with a 450 W Xe lamp, a thermo-electric cooled red sensitive PMT and an R5509-72 NIR-PMT all in liquid nitrogen cooled housing (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). The spectral resolution was about 0.05 nm in the UV-VIS and 0.075–0.1 nm in the NIR region.
Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the rare earth ion doped Sr2SiO4 samples performed at room temperature are shown in Fig. 1. It has been reported that strontium orthosilicate has an α′ orthorhombic phase with the space group Pmnb and a β monoclinic phase with the space group P21/n.17,18 As shown in Fig. 1, all the XRD patterns of the Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+, Sr2SiO4:0.02Pr3+ and Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+,0.02Pr3+ samples we synthesized showed the single phase α′-Sr2SiO4 and all the peaks matched well with the JCPDS card (No. 39-1256). This indicates that the doped Eu2+/Pr3+ ions had no obvious effect on the crystal structure. Notably, there are two distinct crystallographic sites of Sr which the Eu2+/Pr3+ ions could possibly occupy. In order to investigate the site occupation and site-adjusting luminescence of the Eu2+/Pr3+ ions, we further examined the Rietveld refinement of Sr2SiO4:0.12Eu2+,0.12Pr3+ as follows. Here, the high concentration of doped Eu2+/Pr3+ ions was to improve the reliability of the refinement results.

The Rietveld refinement results are presented in Fig. 2 and Table S1 (ESI†). The refined lattice constants are a = 5.6284(7) Å, b = 7.1034(9) Å, and c = 9.7301(4) Å, and the cell volume V = 389.029 (1) Å3. The two kinds of Sr sites are Sr(I) with ten oxygen atoms coordinated and Sr(II) with nine oxygen atoms coordinated, which the Eu2+/Pr3+ ions disproportionately occupied. Table S1 (ESI†) shows that both the Eu2+/Pr3+ ions preferably substituted into the Sr(II) sites compared to the Sr(I) sites, and then the luminescent properties of Eu2+/Pr3+ in the two different sites will be adjusted later.

In order to minimize the effects of host vibrations or phonons and to investigate the fine energy levels of Eu2+, the PLE and PL spectra of Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+ at 4 K were measured (see the spectra at room temperature in the ESI†). Fig. 3 shows the PLE and PL spectra of Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+ at 4 K. It can be clearly seen that the PL spectra under excitation energies of 330/370 nm consist of two broad bands centered at about 470 and 540 nm, both of which are due to the typical 4f–5d transitions of Eu2+ ions. As discussed in Fig. 2, there are two distinct crystallographic sites, Sr(I) and Sr(II), which are coordinated by ten and nine oxygen atoms in the α′-Sr2SiO4 phase, respectively. Consequently, these two broadband emissions at 470 and 540 nm are ascribed to the 4f–5d transitions of the Eu2+ ion in these two distinct crystallographic sites.19,20 Furthermore, the mean Sr–O distances for Sr(I) (CN = 10) and Sr(II) (CN = 9) obtained from the XRD refinement are estimated to be 2.855 Å and 2.702 Å.21 The shorter the mean Sr–O distance, the tighter the crystal field environment that is available for Eu2+. In general, the 5d orbital of an Eu2+ ion has a larger splitting when it suffers a tighter or stronger crystal field and consequently, based on crystal field theory, the Eu2+ ion would give a longer wavelength emission.22 Therefore, the emission of Eu2+ centering at 470 nm corresponds to the Sr(I) site with a longer Sr–O distance, while the other emission band dominating at 540 nm is due to Eu2+ in the Sr(II) site with a shorter bond length. Additionally, the PLE spectrum of Eu2+ has a wider excitation band when its emission is monitored at 540 nm than at 470 nm, also suggesting that the Eu2+ ion is in the Sr(II) site rather than the Sr(I) site, that it suffers a stronger crystal field and that it has a much lower energy 5d state.
 Fig. 3  PLE and PL spectra of Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+ at 4 K. 
It can be clearly seen in Fig. 3 that the Eu2+ ion exhibits site-dependent PL and PLE features, due to its “naked” 5d electron configuration as discussed above. Contrarily, it is strongly expected that a Pr3+ ion would not show any obvious site-dependent PL and PLE features, due to its inert 4f electron configuration even though there are two distinct crystallographic sites available for the Pr3+ ion. Fig. 4a shows the PLE and PL spectra of Pr3+ in the visible region. It is obvious to see that the Pr3+ ion exhibits different PLE features when different emission peaks were monitored. Monitoring the 612 nm emissions, there were a series of sharp excitation peaks in the wavelength range of 430–490 nm, due to the 3H4 → 3P0, 3P1/1I6, and 3P2 transitions of Pr3+.23–25 Monitoring the 604 nm emissions, Pr3+ gives the same PL features with several additional novel sharp peaks at around 581 nm, 585 nm and 595 nm, ascribed to the 3H4 → 1D2 transitions of the Pr3+ ions.26 All of these PLE features of Pr3+ are almost consistent with the absorption lines in the DRS shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), strongly supporting the energy level assignments of the Pr3+ ion. Also the Pr3+ ion exhibits wavelength-dependent PL features similar to in the PLE spectrum. Under 595 nm excitation (3H4 → 1D2), the PL spectrum only has one emission peak at 604 nm, due to the 1D2 → 3H4 transition of the Pr3+ ion. Under 449 nm excitation, the PL spectrum mainly consists of four emission peaks centering at 485, 552, 612 and 646 nm, ascribed to the 3P0 → 3H4, 3P0 → 3H5, 3P0 → 3H6 and 3P0 → 3F2 transitions of the Pr3+ ion, as well as one emission peak at 604 nm, assigned to the 1D2 → 3H4 transition of the Pr3+ ion.27Fig. 4b shows the visible PLE and NIR PL spectra of Pr3+ in Sr2SiO4. It is obvious to see that the Pr3+ ion has the same PLE features whenever 604 or 1032 nm (612 or 927 nm) are monitored. Under 449 (3H4 → 3P2) and 595 nm (3H4 → 1D2) excitation, the Pr3+ ion also exhibits wavelength-dependent NIR PL features similar to the visible PLE spectrum. Under 449 nm excitation (3H4 → 3P2), the NIR emission spectrum mainly consists of two emission peaks at 877 and 1032 nm, due to the 1D2 → 3F2,4 transitions, as well as one emission line around 927 nm, ascribed to the 3P0 → 1G4 transitions. Under 595 nm excitation (3H4 → 1D2), the NIR emission spectra are almost the same except that the emission peak (3P0 → 1G4) of the Pr3+ ion at 927 nm disappears.

Comparing the emission band of Eu2+ in the two sites and the excitation band of Pr3+ in Fig. 3 and 4, the overlap between the two suggests that an energy transfer from Eu2+ to Pr3+ could possibly occur and we could use this to achieve versatile applications via adjustable VIS/NIR emissions at different sites. The PLE and PL spectra of Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+,0.02Pr3+ in the VIS (a) and NIR (b) regions at 4 K were also investigated and are shown in Fig. 5. Compared with the Sr2SiO4:0.02Pr3+ sample, the PLE/PL spectra of Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+,0.02Pr3+ all consist of a broad band in the VIS region and several sharp peaks in the VIS/NIR region. The broad band is obviously due to the typical 4f ↔ 5d transitions of Eu2+ ions and the sharp peaks are ascribed to the forbidden 4f ↔ 4f transitions of Pr3+ ions. In detail, when monitoring the NIR emissions of Pr3+ at 925/1031 nm, the presence of the 4f → 5d transitions of the Eu2+ ions in the PLE spectrum indicates that efficient ET from Eu2+ to Pr3+ occurs. Under 330/420 nm excitation of the Eu2+ ions, there are several emission peaks of Pr3+ in the VIS (485 nm, 604 nm, 612 nm and 646 nm) and NIR (875 nm, 927 nm, 996 nm and 1031 nm) regions, which also suggests the ET from Eu2+ to Pr3+. This means that the Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+,0.02Pr3+ phosphor harvests UV-VIS light and gives NIR emission at around 1000 nm, which means that it could be used as a potential light convertor to improve the efficiency of c-Si solar cells (Si solar cells have the best spectral response at about 1000 nm of daylight).
 Fig. 5  PLE and PL spectra of Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+,0.02Pr3+ in VIS (a) and NIR (b) regions at 4 K. 
There are still some differences in the spectral features exhibited in the PL/PLE spectra in Fig. 5. Under 330 nm excitation of the Eu2+ ions in the Sr(I) sites, all the emission peaks of Pr3+ exist in the VIS/NIR region. Comparably, with the excitation of the Eu2+ ions in Sr(II) sites at 420 nm, several emission peaks (485 nm, 612 nm, 646 nm and 927 nm) of Pr3+ disappear, while other emission peaks of Pr3+ and visible light emissions of Eu2+ (dominated at 540 nm) in Sr(II) sites could still be seen.28 This result means that several emission peaks of Pr3+ are excitation-dependant in the ET process. All the excitation-dependant emission peaks (485 nm, 612 nm, 646 nm and 927 nm) of Pr3+ in Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+,0.02Pr3+ are from the 1D2 excited energy level when Eu2+ in the Sr(II) site is excited. Compared with the emission spectra of Pr3+ and Eu2+ in Fig. 3 and 4, we came to the conclusion that the excited energy of Eu2+ in the Sr(II) site is transferred to the 1D2 energy level of Pr3+, so that the emission from the 1D2 energy level could only be seen with excitation of Eu2+ in the Sr(II) site.
Based on the excitation-dependent spectral features, the ET mechanism from Eu2+ to Pr3+ is illustrated in Fig. 6. The upper left corner and the upper right corner show the PLE and Gauss-fitted PL spectra of Eu2+ at 4 K in the Sr2SiO4 host. As discussed in Fig. 3, there are two kinds of Sr site in Sr2SiO4 and two different emissions of Eu2+. We could get the 5d excited level position of Eu2+ from the Gauss-fitted PL and PLE spectra at 4 K at each Sr site. Under 250–475 nm excitation, the electrons of Eu2+ in both Sr sites are pumped from the ground level to the excited 5d state. Then some of them go back to the ground state, emitting blue/green light and some part of the excited energy is transferred to Pr3+ with the assistance of phonons. In this ET process, as shown in Fig. 6, the lowest 5d energy of Eu2+ in the Sr(I) site is very close to the 3P0 energy level of Pr3+, but the lowest 5d energy of Eu2+ in the Sr(II) site is a little higher than the 1D2 energy level of Pr3+. So the energy could be transferred from the 5d excited state of Eu2+ to the 3P0 excited energy level of Pr3+ in the Sr(I) site, and only be transferred to the lower 1D2 excited energy level of Pr3+ when Eu2+ is in the Sr(II) site.29 Consequently, all emission lines of Pr3+ should be seen under the excitation of Eu2+ in the Sr(I) site, and only the emission lines of Pr3+ from the 1D2 level should appear under the excitation of Eu2+ in the Sr(II) site.

The synthesized Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+,0.02Pr3+ phosphor was fabricated on a 440 nm blue chip for a white LED, and a spectrum of the LED device is shown in Fig. 7. The inserts in Fig. 7 are digital photos of the device when it is and when it is not under work. The Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+,0.02Pr3+ phosphor shows a yellow color in gel in daylight and an intense white light emission when combined with the blue chip in the LED. The spectrum of the white LED device consists of three parts: the emission of the blue 440 nm chip, the yellow emission from Eu2+, and the red emission lines from Pr3+, which could efficiently enhance the color rendering index and make warm white light. The CIE color coordinate of the LED device, as shown in Fig. 8, was calculated to be (0.339, 0.334) from the emission spectrum of the white LED in Fig. 7.30 Consequently, all the results in Fig. 7 and 8 demonstrate that an intense white light emission could be achieved using the Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+,0.02Pr3+ phosphor and a blue chip.

Conclusions
We successfully synthesized the dual-emission phosphor Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+,0.02Pr3+ with yellow to orange emissions and NIR emission around 1000 nm. By adjusting the various excitation wavelengths of the activator at different sites, its emission wavelength in both the VIS and NIR regions could be adjusted, highlighting its potential application in white LED devices fabricated with blue chips and in solar cells as a potential light converting material. Furthermore, LED devices fabricated with the Sr2SiO4:0.02Eu2+,0.02Pr3+ phosphor showed a white light emission with CIE colour coordinates of (0.339, 0.334), and the mechanism based on site-selected ET in this process was also discussed in detail. We believe that this site-selected ET mechanism is also suitable for the design of light converting materials with different luminescent wavelengths for various applications, which will not only be designed by choosing appropriate luminescent center ions for the matrixes.
