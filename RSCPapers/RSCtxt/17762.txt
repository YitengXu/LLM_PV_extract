    , Accepted 21st April 2017First published on 22nd April 2017AbstractSemitransparent solar cells have attracted significant attention for their potential applications, though obtaining high average visible transmittance (AVT) while maintaining good conversion efficiency is a challenge. Here, we report a method to fabricate fully printable semitransparent perovskite solar cells with a (5-AVA)0.05(MA)0.95PbI3 infiltrated mesoporous TiO2/Al2O3/carbon architecture. Carbon grids were printed as top electrodes, and the effects of the grid spacing on device performance were systematically investigated. Under the smallest grid spacing, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.31% was achieved, though the AVT was low. By adjusting the grid spacing, the highest AVT of 26.4% was obtained, though the PCE dropped to 5.36%. A thin layer of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was then introduced on the top electrode, which improved both the conductivity and charge transfer characteristic of the electrode, resulting in a high PCE of 8.21% while maintaining a good AVT of 24.0%.
1. Introduction
Inorganic–organic halide perovskite solar cells have attracted enormous attention as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), simple fabrication procedures, and low-cost.1–4 In just a few years after their emergence, the PCE of perovskite solar cells has increased from 3.8% to 22.1%.5,6 This tremendous progress is mainly attributed to unique electrical and optical properties of inorganic–organic halide perovskites, such as high light absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, and direct bandgaps, all of which make them an ideal material for photovoltaic applications.7–11 With the rapid development of perovskite solar cells, semitransparent perovskite solar cells have also received growing attention, which are promising for applications in photo-voltaic curtains, building-integrated photovoltaics, wearable electronics and tandem cells.12–15
As is well known, transparent electrodes are the key to the development of semitransparent solar cells. An ideal transparent top electrode must have high transparency, low resistance, robust chemical stability, low cost, and effective charge collecting ability. A large amount of work has already been carried out to develop anodes and cathodes for semitransparent perovskite solar cells. For example, Roldán et al. fabricated a semitransparent perovskite solar cell by thermally evaporating perovskite layers and thin Au electrodes, achieving a PCE of 7.73% and an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 19%.16 Later, Guo et al. reported a semitransparent perovskite solar cell with a PCE of 8.49% by spraying Ag nanowires as a transparent top electrode, though the stability of Ag is poor due to the formation of Ag halides, causing degradation of the performance.17,18 Recently, conductive polymers such as PEDOT:PSS and conductive oxides such as ITO have also been applied as electrodes for semitransparent perovskite solar cells,19–21 though the lamination process involved is not easy for large scale device fabrication.
Carbon is an ideal electrode material due to its excellent conductivity, high stability, and low-cost.22–24 Several carbon materials have already been successfully applied to semitransparent perovskite solar cells as top electrodes. For example, carbon nanotubes and graphene have been used as top electrodes by several groups.25,26 But as the methods of transferring the laminated CNTs membrane or graphene membrane were employed in the typical procedures to apply CNTs or graphene, it also introduced the complexity and caused difficulties in facile syntheses that can make difficulties for large-scale manufacturing. Recently, carbon-based HTM-free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells have attracted attention, after reports published by Han et al.27–29 These devices were fabricated by screen-printing black/graphite composite materials as top electrodes, though they are not transparent, which we seek to overcome using carbon grids.
In this work, we report fully printable semitransparent perovskite solar cells with a (5-AVA)0.05(MA)0.95PbI3 infiltrated mesoporous TiO2/Al2O3/carbon architecture. We applied carbon grids as top electrodes for semitransparent perovskite solar cells, which were printed with the black/graphite composite material. We systematically studied the photovoltaic performances and the AVT values of devices with different carbon grids, and achieved the highest PCE of 11.31%. By optimizing the spacing between carbon grid lines, we obtained the highest AVT of 26.4% and a PCE of 5.36%. We then introduced a thin layer of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on the top electrode of the device with the highest AVT, which improves the hole collection, resulting in a high PCE of 8.21% and an excellent AVT of 24.0%.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials synthesis
CH3NH3I (MAI) and HOOC(CH2)4NH3I (5-AVAI) were synthesized as follows: hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in aqueous solution) was put to react with methylamine (33 wt% in methanol) or 5-aminopentanoic acid with a molar ratio of 1:1 in a round-bottom flask at 0 °C for 2 h. After that the remaining liquid was evaporated in a rotary evaporator at 50 °C and precipitates were obtained. The precipitates were dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized by using diethyl ether, and dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 24 h. And then 40 wt% (5-AVA)0.05(MA)0.95PbI3 solution was prepared by mixing the 5-AVAI, PbI2 and MAI with a molar ratio of 0.05:1:0.95 in γ-butyrolactone and stirred at 60 °C overnight.
The MWCNT solution was prepared as follows: rough MWCNTs were purchased from Chengdu Organic Chemicals CO., LTD. Firstly, the MWCNTs were oxidized30 by loading 0.3 g pristine MWCNTs into a sand core crucible placed in a 50 mL Teflon-vessel with 3 mL nitric acid in the bottom. Following heating at 120 °C in an oven for 2 h, the oxidized MWCNTs were collected after washing with distilled water and ethanol several times, and then dispersed in diethyl ether (0.3 mg mL−1) and ultrasonicated for 60 min to obtain a homogeneous dispersion suspension of the MWCNTs.
2.2. Device fabrication
The fabrication procedure of semitransparent perovskite solar cells is shown in Fig. 1. FTO glass (7 Ω sq−1) was etched by Zn powder and hydrochloric acid to form two detached electrode patterns, ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone and ethanol successively, and dried with compressed nitrogen. A UV/ozone treatment was carried out on the etched FTO glasses for 30 min, and a compact TiO2 hole-blocking layer was deposited on the treated FTO glass by spray pyrolysis deposition of ethanol solution containing titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (v/v, 9:1) at 450 °C. Then the FTO glass was heated at 450 °C for 30 min and cooled down to room temperature. A mesoporous TiO2 (DSL. 18NR-T, 20 nm, Dyesol, Australia, diluted at the 1:3.5 mass ratio of paste/terpineol) layer was screen-printed onto the substrate and heated at 500 °C for 30 min, and a Al2O3 spacer (DLS. 20 wt% in isopropanol, 50 nm, Sigma, diluted at the 1:1.5:1.5 mass ratio of paste/terpineol/ethyl cellulose) layer was screen printed onto the mesoporous TiO2 layer and heated at 500 °C for 30 min. Finally a carbon black/graphite (black/graphite mass ratio 1:4)31,32 layer or grid was screen-printed onto the spacer layer and heated at 400 °C for 30 min. The device covered with carbon layer is marked as sample 0 and other devices covered with carbon grids with different spacings are marked as sample 1–6, as detailed in Fig. 2. The as-prepared film was then infiltrated with (5-AVA)0.05(MA)0.95PbI3 by spin-coating its solution on the top of the carbon counter electrode at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and kept at 50 °C for 2 h. Furthermore, the MWCNT layer was deposited onto the top electrode of sample 6 (marked as sample 6 + CNT) by spraying at 50 °C and then dried at 50 °C for 15 min. All the procedures were completed in air atmosphere.

2.3. Characterization
The surface and the cross-sectional morphologies of samples were characterized with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Nova NanoSEM 450). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley model 2400 source meter. Illumination was provided by using a Newport solar simulator (model 91192) with an AM 1.5 G spectrum distribution and light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The intensity was calibrated with a VLSI standards incorporated PN 91150V Si reference cell with a mismatch factor less than 1%. A black mask with an area of 0.16 cm2 was placed onto the active area of the devices. A similar data acquisition system (Newport 70104) was used to perform the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements. The transmittance spectrum of the device was measured using an UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer, lambda 950). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, CIMPS) over a frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV under dark conditions.
3. Results and discussion
The optical images of the as-fabricated semitransparent perovskite solar cells are shown in Fig. 3. It is observed that perovskite infiltrates into TiO2/Al2O3/carbon layers well. The cross-sectional SEM image of FTO/TiO2/Al2O3/carbon layers with the perovskite material is shown in Fig. 4(a). Four layers of constituent materials are observed from the SEM. On the top of FTO is a TiO2 mesoscopic layer with a thickness of about 0.45 μm and in good contact with the FTO glass substrate. Over the TiO2 mesoscopic layer is an Al2O3 spacer layer with the thickness of about 1.2 μm, which is covered by a carbon/graphite mesoscopic layer. The large flakes of graphite are observed embedded inside carbon materials. The SEM image of the MWCNT layers is shown in Fig. 4(b), and it is observed that the morphology of MWCNTs is retained with tens of micrometers of length. The long vine-like structure makes the MWCNTs easily cross together to form a continuous and crack-free network. From Fig. 4(c), it is observed that some MWCNTs were deposited inside the grid spacing and have a direct contact with perovskite.

To investigate the effect of different spacings between the carbon grid lines on the performance of devices, the conductivity of all carbon counter electrodes was tested first, since they play an important role in extracting and collecting holes. The test method and results are shown in Fig. S1(a) and (b).† It is obvious that sample 0 shows the minimum Rls of 51.4 Ω, and Rls increases from 60.2 Ω to 130.8 Ω with the decreasing density of carbon grid lines. It is interesting that when the MWCNTs were coated on the top of sample 6, the Rls of 6 + CNT decreases from 130.8 Ω to 110.6 Ω, which is lower than that of sample 5. Since MWCNTs have superior electron transport properties, they can serve as a bridge that connects carbon grid lines to form a charge transport network, as shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, the MWCNTs can also provide a direct path for charge transfer and collection, as schematically demonstrated in Fig. S1(c).†
The J–V characteristics of all devices were recorded and are presented in Fig. 5(a). The key parameters of the device performance are shown in Table 1, wherein 10 different devices are measured for each type of samples, and both maximum and average performances are shown. It is observed that sample 1 has achieved the optimal photovoltaic performance with an average Jsc of 21.07 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.87 V, and a FF of 58.9%, yielding an average PCE of 10.80%, whereas the PCE of the champion cell is 11.31%. It is somewhat surprising that the average PCE of sample 0 with the lowest Rls is only 9.00%, with an average Jsc of 20.16 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.85 V, and a FF of 52.5%. The average PCE of sample 1 is 20% higher than that of sample 0 since the carbon counter electrode of sample 0 is prepared by printing a thick carbon black/graphite layer, making it difficult for perovskite to infiltrate into TiO2/Al2O3/carbon layers, resulting in poor filling of the perovskite in the mesoscopic layers. On the other hand, the carbon counter electrode of sample 1 employed carbon grid lines, making it easier for the perovskite to infiltrate into TiO2/Al2O3/carbon layers while retaining good conductivity. Importantly, it is observed that the Voc of the device is not sensitive to the reduction of carbon grid lines, yet the Jsc and the PCE decrease significantly with the reduction. Having the smallest carbon grid lines, sample 6 shows the lowest Jsc of 11.32 mA cm−2, and the corresponding average PCE is only 5.08%. This is because of increased Rls that results in increased series resistance. Table 1 shows that the series resistance (R1) obtained from the linear fitting of the J–V curve increases with the decreasing of carbon grid lines, resulting in decreased Jsc. In order to overcome this difficulty, MWCNTs were coated onto sample 6, which decreased R1 and increased Jsc. The average Jsc of sample 6 + CNT increases from 11.32 mA cm−2 to 17.94 mA cm−2, accompanied by the Voc of 0.87 V and FF of 51.5%, resulting in an average PCE of 8.04% and highest PCE of 8.21%. The MWCNTs not only bridge carbon grid lines to form a charge transport network but also provide a direct path for charge transfer and collection, and thus they are effective to improve Jsc. These results are also confirmed by the IPCE spectrum shown in Fig. 5(b). By calculating the IPCE, the integral Jsc values of the devices obtained are well consistent with J–V test results, as shown in Table 1.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to investigate the interfacial charge transfer and was carried out at a bias of −0.8 V in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz under dark conditions. Fig. 6(a) and (b) display the Nyquist plots of all devices, composed of two separated semicircles. The small semicircle at high frequency is attributed to the resistance (Rce) of the charge transfer process at the interface of carbon and perovskite, while the large semicircle at low frequency is related to the charge transfer resistance (Rrec) between the mesoscopic TiO2 and the perovskite layer, related to the resistance of charge recombination.33–35 In addition, the starting point of the small semicircle part corresponds to the series resistance (Rs).36 It can be seen that sample 1 has the lowest Rs, indicating that it obtains the highest Jsc. The Rs increases with the reduction of carbon grid lines, which is consistent with the trend of the Rls. Considering that the back contact is the only difference in these cells, the conductivity of the back contact can be directly reflected in Rs, which can also explain the change of the Jsc. Moreover, we find that sample 1 and sample 6 + CNT have relatively larger Rrec, which suggests a stronger suppression of charge recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interfaces. Hence, it is understandable that sample 1 and sample 6 + CNT show a higher Voc than other cells. Besides, because sample 1 possesses the smallest Rs and the largest Rrec, the FF of sample 1 is the highest of all devices. On the other hand, the MWCNTs coated on the electrode improved the performance of the counter electrode not only by reducing the resistance of the carbon grids, but also by directly helping charge transfer and collection that led to the increased Voc and Jsc.

Fig. 7(a) and S2† show the transmittance spectra of different devices and the details of AVT parameters are listed in Table 1. Such AVT is taken as the average of the transmittance in the visible region of the spectra between 400 nm and 800 nm. Table 1 shows that the AVT increases gradually from 6.5% to 26.4% with the decrease of carbon grid lines. In addition, sample 6 + CNT has a high AVT of 24.0%, which is affected little by the introduction of MWCNTs since they possess good transparency. From Fig. 7(a), it is also observed the transparency of sample 6 + CNT improved quickly after 570 nm, which is also observed in the device of TiO2/Al2O3/MWCNTs with (5-AVA)0.05(MA)0.95PbI3 in comparison to the device of TiO2/Al2O3 with (5-AVA)0.05(MA)0.95PbI3, as shown in Fig. S3.† The reason, possibly due to the changes in perovskite induced by the hydroxyl and carboxyl of the treated MWCNTs, needs further investigation. To understand this, the relationship between the PCE and the AVT of the devices is shown in Fig. 7(b). Sample 6 presents the highest AVT of 26.4% and has a PCE of 5.36%. On the other hand, sample 6 + CNT shows a high PCE of 8.21% with an AVT of 24.0%. A photograph of a semitransparent device is shown in the inset of Fig. 7(b), exhibiting reasonable visual transparency. We also compared our results with recently reported semitransparent perovskite solar cells in the literature, as shown in Fig. S4,† and our devices possess high PCE under similar AVT values. Finally, the long-term stability of sample 6 + CNT was tested, as shown in Fig. S5.† The device was stored in air at room temperature without any encapsulation. The result shows that the PCE of sample 6 + CNT remains 6.88% after 500 h, more than 80% of the initial value, showing good stability. These results suggest that semitransparent carbon-based HTM-free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells can be realized with a simple and low-cost procedure.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we successfully prepared fully printable semitransparent perovskite solar cells with carbon grids as top electrodes. By adjusting the spacing between the carbon grid lines, the AVT values of the devices were tuned. With the smallest spacing of the carbon grid lines, we achieved the highest PCE of 11.31%. When the spacing of the carbon grid lines is the largest, we obtained the highest AVT of 26.4%. Finally, by introducing MWCNTs on the top electrode of the device with the highest AVT, we improved its PCE to 8.21% while maintaining a good AVT of 24.0%. These results suggest that nanotube enhanced carbon grids provide a low-cost pathway to fabricate high efficiency semitransparent perovskite solar cells.
