    , Accepted 27th April 2020First published on 29th April 2020AbstractFor a good reason, water splitting is the most pioneering energy storage technology. However, particularly water electrolysis still has a shadow existence compared to currently used methods for mass production of hydrogen. All known materials currently exploited as anodes for electrocatalytically initiated water-splitting suffer from high overpotentials and substantial mass loss during long term operation in acidic media. Low electrode stability affects operating and maintenance costs and together with high overpotentials directly lowers the overall efficiency of electrocatalytically driven splitting of water. In circumventing these problems, scientists and engineers are currently modifying electrode materials. We chose a completely different path and modified the electrolyte. An electrolysis set up, that consists of a Ni42 stainless steel anode and of hematite which is suspended in high concentration in sulfuric acid and acts as the electrolyte, exhibits oxygen evolution electrocatalysis at extremely low potential (1.26 V vs. RHE; 0.5 M H2SO4, j = 30 mA cm−2). If implemented in a suitable electrolyzer, an ultralow cell voltage of 1.6 V and an almost quantitative charge to oxygen + hydrogen conversion rate can be achieved. Remarkably, the negligible mass loss of the anode which consists exclusively of non-platinum group metals (non-PGM) during 100 h of operation. Experiments aimed at clarifying the mechanism suggest that Fe2O3 is converted to a Fe(II)/Fe(III) oxide species on the cathode which is then reconverted to Fe2O3 upon release of molecular oxygen when touching the anode. As a result, the oxygen-evolving centers are likely to be on the oxide particles rather than on the electrode. This proposed mechanism would explain the low potential of the OER electrode (+1.26 V vs. RHE at j = 30 mA cm−2) that could not be explained convincingly by an assumed direct oxidation of water molecules.
Introduction
Besides the limited availability of fossil fuels, the greenhouse gas production upon burning of oil and gas forces scientists and engineers to search for alternative (green) energy carriers that are produced CO2 footprint free, i.e. produced as much as possible through the uses of renewable energy resources like wind, solar, hydropower or geothermal.1–4 Hydrogen has future potential as an energy carrier due to its high energy content and its harmless burning products. Electrocatalytically initiated water splitting, if sourced by green electricity, allows reasonable, while CO2 footprint free, access to clean hydrogen and oxygen, the fuel with which a fuel cell can be run.5–16 The usefulness of electrocatalytically driven H2/O2 production stands or falls with its efficiency which is in turn directly determined by the overpotentials occurring on the anode and the cathode side where the oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) take place.17 Ascribable to the sluggish kinetics of the corresponding half-cell reaction, oxygen evolving electrodes contribute mainly to the surplus of cell voltage which must be applied in addition to the theoretical decomposition voltage (1.228 V) of water electrolysis. Therefore, the OER is the main source for overvoltage.18–20 This especially comes into play when electrocatalytic water oxidation is intended at a low pH value.
While in alkaline media non platinum group metal (non PGM) containing electrodes can be regarded as permanent and stable OER-supporting electrocatalysts which show no significant weight loss with long-term use and at the same time ensure a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at overpotentials in the 200 mV range,21,22 this is nowhere near the case when water splitting in acids is intended.23,24 It can be assumed that these effects are largely responsible for the fact that water electrolysis still has a shadowy existence compared to the current techniques for mass production of hydrogen. In terms of practical applicability on a large scale and adaptivity to frequent changes of the current load, electrodes that can withstand an acidic environment are beneficial: thus, proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers which require acidic stable electrode materials are seen as the method of choice for the storage of renewable energy characterized by high dynamics.25 This is due to several advantages, mainly that PEM has an extremely low permeability to hydrogen and this ensures a very high purity of the output hydrogen stream, while eliminating the safety issues associated with gas mixing which is a substantial problem when e.g. alkaline electrolyzers have to run temporarily under a wide range of partial load. The attractiveness of PEM type electrolyzers pushed scientists and engineers to develop OER electrode materials actively and durably working in an acidic medium. In view of the highly corrosive environment in combination with oxidative potentials, it is easy to understand that these requirements of electrodes, which preferably consist of non-noble elements, are difficult to meet.
Thus, for instance, in terms of surface-modified steel, which corresponds to our expertise, overpotentials of 550 mV (ref. 23) and 574 mV (ref. 24) respectively, at pH 1 and j = 10 mA cm−2 derived from chronopotentiometric (CP) data were assigned to electro-activated Ni-based23 and Co-based24 stainless steel. A reason that worries even more: the significant mass loss of the steel anode when it promotes the OER in 0.05 M H2SO4 amounted to 20 μg mm−2 (Ni-based steel)23 and 39 μg mm−2 (Co-based steel)24 after 50000 s of CP at only 10 mA cm−2 current density.
Generally, oxides of nickel and cobalt have proven to be unstable in an acidic medium when positive potentials have been applied.26,27 In particular, Ir-oxide and Ru-oxide as well as IrO2–RuO2 were found to be substantially more active and durable towards the OER electrocatalytically promoted in acids.23,24,27–29 Not least because of the scarcity and (as a consequence thereof) the high price, the need for large quantities of these substances should be limited. Diluting the expensive components of electro-catalysts e.g. Ru or Ir by simply adding “more commonplace” elements is a reasonable and obvious approach to circumventing this problem. This strategy was realized by various groups.30–33 To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the best OER performance achieved in acids at pH0 upon using this strategy (IrOx/SrIrO3) was shown by Seitz et al. (η = 280 mV at 10 mA cm−2).32 Leakage of Sr out of the material during the first 2 hours of electrochemical testing goes hand in hand with an increment of its activity towards the OER. However, it appears reasonable to assume that leakage of Sr out of the anode continues when positive potentials are applied for a long time in an acidic medium. For ternary Sr–Ir–O compounds, substantial leakage of Sr besides smaller amounts of Ir upon usage as OER electrodes in acids was confirmed recently34 exhibiting that even under current-less conditions SrIrO3 dissolves in acid.
Instead of developing new catalytically active layers, new self-supported OER electrodes or designing new substrate/active layer combinations we decided to take a different, new path and modified the electrolyte.
The original intent of this study was to direct the oxygen evolution centers (and the material removal they cause) away from the electrode to particles suspended in the acid-based electrolyte. Iron oxide is of potential interest since Fe can exist in two different oxidation states, both of which can be achieved in aqueous systems. Besides, the ability of iron oxide-based species such as Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 to promote catalytic splitting of water molecules is well known.35–37 Magnetite particles suspended in an electrolyte however have a considerable drawback. They are magnetic and therefore crowd around the stir bar. Hematite (a-Fe2O3) proved to be the material of choice due to its remarkable stability in an aqueous environment, its low cost and its high element frequency. With a band gap of 2.1 eV, hematite is preferably used as a photoanode material.38,39
Nano-scaled hematite suspended in sulfuric acid turned out to substantially influence the current voltage behavior of a known electrode configuration consisting of stainless-steel electrodes during water electrolysis at low pH values.
The chosen design ensured electrocatalytic water oxidation on stainless steel, demonstrating a tremendous, hitherto unprecedented efficiency and stability.
Results and discussion
Water electrolysis was performed in 0.5 M sulfuric acid under strong stirring upon using a three-electrode set-up consisting of a Ni42 steel electrode exploited as anode (working electrode, WE), a platinum cathode (counter electrode, CE) as well as of a reversible hydrogen electrode (positioned between WE and CE) used as the reference electrode (RE). Chronopotentiometric measurements were started at a total current of 300 mA which corresponds to 150 mA cm−2 current density (electrode area: 2 cm2). As expected, the potential required to ensure this strong current flow amounted to values substantially above 2 V vs. RHE (sample 1; Fig. 1a, blue curve). After 10000 s the current density was reduced to 150 mA cm−2, and after an additional 600 s, to 30 mA cm−2, respectively. As expected, the corresponding potential was found to be reduced in steps as well, and finally reached a constant value of 1.90 V vs. RHE which seems to be reasonable in light of earlier results (1.935 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm−2 at pH 1) derived from OER tests carried out under steady state conditions with untreated steel Ni42 in acids.23 Ni42 steel contains around 42 wt% Ni and also showed a considerable OER activity in an alkaline medium without any treatment, according to earlier studies, e.g., in 0.1 M KOH (η = 347 mV at 10 mA cm−2) due to the formation of γ-NiOOH on the very surface.21,53 Properly electro-activated, it exhibited good OER performance over a wide pH range.53

(d) Cyclic voltammetry scan of sample 8 after 60000 s of activation (CP) as seen in (a). 
In a comparative experiment (sample 8), carried out under similar conditions, the clear electrolyte was replaced by a suspension. Hematite was suspended in 0.5 M sulfuric acid at a relatively high concentration (28 wt%) to form a deep red suspension (Fig. 1b; for details see the Experimental Section). The potential required to result in 150 mA cm−2 and 75 mA cm−2 current density (300 mA and 150 mA total current; first 3 hours of the experiment) was comparable to the one derived from the experiment performed in pure sulfuric acid (Fig. 1a, black and blue curve). The potential that corresponds to j = 30 mA cm−2 is at the beginning somewhat lower than derived from clear electrolyte-based measurements and, in addition, turned out to be not constant (Fig. 1a, black curve). At the beginning of the “30 mA cm−2 region”, the curve drops off flat. Then the potential drops abruptly and turns into a slightly sloping curve which, after a while, transitions to the horizontal, indicating a steady value of about 1.26 V vs. RHE (Fig. 1a, black curve) which corresponds to an overpotential of around 30 mV (at j = 30 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4) with respect to the water oxidation reaction. The dynamic voltage–current characteristics derived from the electrolysis of the suspension (sample 8) were determined at the beginning of the experiment (Fig. 1c) as well as after around 60000 s of electrolysis (Fig. 1d), and they confirmed the ones drawn from the experiments carried out under steady state conditions.
This experiment was repeated 44 times and within the series of experiments the composition of the electrolyte, the stirring rate and the duration of chronopotentiometric steps were varied (Table S1‡). In half of the experiments the Pt CE was replaced by a Ni42 electrode which was found to have no influence on the anode half-cell potential of the set-up.
The weight loss of the Ni42 anode whilst preparing samples 1, 2, 9, 10 and 12–18 i.e. after completion of the first electrolysis step (current protocol I) was determined (Table S1;‡ last column). We explicitly point out that this does not present the mass deficit the completed samples show when used as OER electrocatalysts under long term operation at constant current density, which will be discussed later. In parallel to determining the weight loss, the corresponding electrolyte was analyzed after completion of current protocol I via ICP-OES. Fig. 2a presents a comparison of the weight loss of the Ni42 anodes with the sum of the mass of ions detected in the electrolyte. At a glance, it can be seen that in each case studied, the sum of the material detected in the electrolyte exceeds the weight loss of the anode many times over. This finding proves that the overwhelming part of the material dissolved in the electrolyte has its origin in the suspended hematite. Fig. 2b displays the composition of the substance found in the acidic electrolyte of samples 1, 2, 9, 10 and 12–18. It can be clearly seen that Fe ions are the dominating ionic species. The total mass of iron detected in the electrolyte exceeds that of Ni by a (mean) factor of 22.

Although not every identical set of experimental parameters leads to an absolutely identical voltage/current behavior of CP experiments, the reproducibility can be regarded as very good (Table S1 and Fig. S1–S27‡). A common feature of all voltage–current characteristics of the chronopotentiometric measurements derived from suspension-based approaches is: the potential required to result in 30 mA cm−2 anodic current density was after some time found to be reduced to a value of roughly 1.26 V vs. RHE. The overall cell voltage amounted after some time to 1.60 V at j = 30 mA cm−2 (which corresponds to 1.26 V OER potential determined vs. RHE) for all experiments that have been carried out with Ni42 WE and Pt CE with hematite–sulfuric acid suspensions (30–40 g Fe2O3 and 125 mL 0.5 M H2SO4).
In general, in water electrolysis a potential of around 1.26 V vs. RHE (which corresponds to an overpotential of ∼30 mV) necessary to result in an (anodic) current density of 30 mA cm−2 determined in 0.5 M sulfuric acid is currently unparalleled. A similar low potential for the OER was derived from lithiated Co-based steel.40 However, we determined this potential at a substantially lower current density (10 mA cm−2) and in a neutral medium. In addition, lithiated steel exhibited this outstanding activity only for a short time.40 We recently determined the anodic half-cell reaction of water electrolysis in sulfuric acid realized at stainless steel overpotentials that are at least 25 times higher.23,24 In view of very recently41,42 reported results in the field of acid-based electrocatalysis, these current–voltage relationships are absolute unique. Yang et al. reported on perovskite structured SrIrO3 exhibiting a potential of 1.52 V vs. RHE (η ∼ 300 mV) at 10 mA cm−2 current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 (ref. 41). Zhou et al. investigated Rutile-type oxides of a Mn–Sb–O system and found similar activity as found for IrO2 (onset of the OER at η ∼ 300 mV) in 1 M H2SO4 but with improved stability.43 As mentioned, the overpotential derived from Ir–Sr–O based systems was found to be at least 15 times higher than the one we present in this contribution.32
Tafel measurements were carried out with weak IR correction (see Experimental details) in the upper current density region (>20 mA cm−2) since this current range is closer to industrial conditions (Fig. 3a and b). The Tafel slope amounted to 188.7 mV dec−1 (Fig. 3b). Compared to other works this value seems to be quite high. Since the Tafel slopes were derived from CP data recorded at a higher current density they do not simply cover charge transfer kinetic effects but are likely influenced by mass transfer limitations.

A low potential of the working electrode in OER electrocatalysis can be seen as the first indication of a very efficiently promoted OER, but as long as it is not clear up to what extent anodic current is actually used for the (formal) discharge of O2 to molecular oxygen, it is far from solid evidence. Years ago, we found astonishingly low overpotentials derived from chronopotentiometric measurements carried out with super duplex steel X2CrNiMoCuWN25-7-4 with a chromium content of up to 26 wt% in 0.05 M H2SO4. As can be seen in Fig. 4a, the overpotential for anodic water splitting amounted to ∼250 mV at 10 mA cm−2 current density in 0.05 M H2SO4 which, in principle, is a fantastic low value implying an outstanding OER activity.

(a) Corresponding chronopotentiometric measurements. (b) Correlation of oxygen evolution (black dotted curve) with the charge passed through the electrode system (the red line corresponds to 100% faradaic efficiency). 
However, the charge to oxygen conversion rate (faradaic efficiency) was only 15.7% (Fig. 4b), i.e. the biggest part of the current obviously supports non-OER-based processes e.g. oxidation of the catalyst itself, which is understandable keeping in mind that untreated steel has been studied. This poor faradaic efficiency however prohibits a further investigation of this steel type.
In contrast, OER based electrolysis performed with Ni42 as the WE and Pt as the CE using Fe2O3 suspended in sulfuric acid as electrolyte exhibited a very good faradaic efficiency (Fig. 5).

(a) Chronopotentiometric measurements performed with sample 22 in 0.5 M H2SO4 at current densities of 150 mA cm−2, 75 mA cm−2 and 30 mA cm−2. The areas where the FE measurements begin and end are highlighted. (b) Correlation of oxygen evolution (black dotted curve: measurement 1; blue dotted curve: measurement 2) with the charge passed through the electrode system (the red line corresponds to 100% faradaic efficiency). Amount of the electrolyte: 1.931 L; start value of dissolved oxygen: 0.31 mg L−1 (experiment 1); start value of dissolved oxygen: 0.73 mg L−1 (experiment 2). End value of dissolved oxygen (t = 1300 s): 3.46 mg L (experiment 1); end value of dissolved oxygen (t = 1300 s): 3.82 mg L (experiment 2). Line equation (exp. 1): y = 0.0026x + 0.31; line equation (exp. 2): y = 0.0026x + 0.73 with y = oxygen concentration according to FE = 100% and x = run time. Faradaic efficiency of the OER after 1300 s runtime: 94.1% (experiment 1); 92.2% (experiment 2). (c) Photo of the set-up. 
The faradaic efficiency was determined for the OER on sample 22 under steady state conditions at a constant current density of 30 mA cm−2 after two different operation times within the “low overpotential region” of a typical CP plot (Fig. 5a) after two steps of current protocol I (0.3 A and 0.15 A step) when the OER potential reached a value of ∼1.26 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5a). The faradaic efficiency amounted to 94.1% and 92.2% (based on a transfer of 2 electrons) transfer process respectively after ∼26000 s and ∼56000 s of operation (Fig. 5b). To further confirm that the detected oxygen has been produced by the electrochemical water-splitting half reaction, we additionally monitored the dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte after the electrolysis cell was disconnected from the power source. No significant change of the oxygen concentration was detected within a measuring period of 550 s which indicates that no oxygen flows into the measuring cell from the external environment (Fig. S28‡).
It should be mentioned at this point that a current density of 30 mA cm−2, at which this almost quantitative charge to oxygen conversion rate was determined, is substantially higher than the one chosen by us in earlier experiments or by other groups. Typically, the experimentally determined faradaic efficiency for the OER on electrocatalysts was found to be lower at higher current densities.44 This method of determination is based on changes of the content of dissolved oxygen (in between approximately 0 and 4 mg L−1) in the electrolyte during chronopotentiometric measurements (Fig. 5c, ESI, pages 2–3‡).
In order to further verify the data, we have chosen an additional, different approach that ensures separation of the electrodes and enables separate collection of the generated oxygen and hydrogen gas when using a special electrolysis cell (Fig. 6a, b and Table S2; ESI pages 2–3‡). We expressly point out that these efficiency values are derived from measurements that started when the electrolyte was saturated with oxygen and hydrogen. Based on a transfer of three electrons for the overall water-splitting reaction (eqn (4) + (5)see the section Origin of the unusually high electrocatalytic OER activity – a proposed mechanism) the OER efficiency amounted to 89.6–95%. The HER efficiency turned out to be somewhat lower (73.9–83.6%). It is reasonable to assume that besides the mediated water splitting reaction (three electron process), common direct oxidation of water also still takes place (two electron process according to H2O → H2 + 0.5O2). Table S2‡ therefore shows in addition the values for the OER and HER faradaic efficiency when solely a two electron process is adopted.

The reversible hydrogen electrode is placed in between the CE and WE. (b) Photo of the set up used for determining the faradaic efficiency for the HER and the OER in a sulfuric acid/hematite suspension (sample 39). Current density: 30 mA cm2; E(OER) = 1.26 V vs. RHE; cell voltage: 1.60 V. HER and OER efficiency values see Table S2.‡ 
We also checked the suitability of a Nafion 212 membrane (ESI, pages 3–4, Fig. S29‡) and a glass filter plate to separate the anode and cathode compartments. Neither of the approaches was found to be useful, either due to high cell voltage (glass filter plate) or because of the short lifetime of the membrane which was blocked by the particles or mechanically affected due to the particles in combination with high stirring speed.
In total, 13 experiments have been carried out which aimed to assess the long-term stability of the electrolysis setup against the evolution of oxygen (samples 26–31; 33–40) in 0.05 M H2SO4 or 0.5 M H2SO4 (sample 37–40). Ni42 steel was used as WE and CE for all these experiments. These experiments were performed after carrying out the activation step (current protocol I) and consisted of a CP measurement (current protocol II) at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 (0.05 M H2SO4) or 30 mA cm−2 (0.5 M H2SO4) with a duration in between 78680 s (sample 27) and 529430 s (sample 36) as can be seen in Table S1.‡ Two different approaches were used to test the long-term behavior. The sample series 26–31 + 33–36 were derived from applying a second current protocol in a freshly prepared “mild” hematite/sulfuric acid suspension with a very low amount of hematite (between 2.7 g and 7 g) suspended in 125 mL of diluted sulfuric acid (0.05 M) see Table S1.‡ This strategy led to sufficiently low potentials required to ensure a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. S30‡).
However, the potential derived from CP measurements was found to be unstable and fluctuating between high and low values (Fig. S30‡). The long term OER performance of samples 37–40 had been checked after cleaning and determining the weight of the Ni42 electrodes without replacement of the electrolyte, i.e. the concentration of Fe2O3 in sulfuric acid was substantially higher (35 g in 125 mL H2SO4). A stable potential (averaged 1.26 V vs. RHE) thus very close to the standard Nernst potential of the water oxidation reaction can be derived from all the CP measurements made in this way (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Potential-time behavior of sample 38 determined in a sulfuric acid/hematite suspension. Average potential: 1.26 V vs. RHE. 
An extremely low overpotential for the OER in combination with a sufficient conversion of electrical energy into molecular oxygen are key features of an electrocatalyst according to prior studies. However, in particular, if water cleavage at low pH is desired, there is another enormous challenge for an OER electrocatalyst: the threatening dissolution upon application of positive potentials which attracts a number of negative consequences e.g. an increase in overpotential due to increasing current density (reduction of the active surface), high maintenance and repair costs, pollution of the electrolyte and so on. Although scientists have undertaken enormous research efforts to get this problem under control, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exists a single paper that reports on electrocatalysts durably supporting the OER in an acidic medium. This assessment even captures noble element containing materials like Ir-oxide, Ru-oxide or Ir–Ru-oxide.32
Thus, OER electrocatalysts that exhibit promising electrochemical characteristics in an acidic medium still need to prove inertness towards mass loss that occurs when positive potentials are applied.
In addition to capturing the current–voltage characteristics, the mass deficit of the anode that occurs during long term usage as an oxygen evolving electrode was determined. Again, the best results (samples 37–40) were obtained when, after completion of the activation step, the electrodes were washed and dried and, after determining the mass loss, were used as the WE and CE in the same electrolyte to perform the long term performance test. Stirring was applied during long term electrolysis; however, the stirring rate was, in comparison with the one used during the activation procedure, reduced from 4.5 to 3.0. The average duration of CP testing at 30 mA cm−2 was 341000 s (almost 95 h). The anodes lost (averaged) 30.1 mg of mass upon exploitation as the oxygen evolving electrode for 341000 s in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 30 mA cm−2 (Table S1‡). This corresponds to a mass deficit of 22 μg mm−2 after 50000 s of CP at 30 mA cm−2 current density which can be seen as an outstandingly good outcome especially when taking into consideration the high current density of 30 mA cm−2, the aggressive electrolyte with pH0 and the fact that the electrodes solely consist of non-noble elements.
The origin of the unusually high electrocatalytic OER activity – a proposed mechanism
Since the ultralow OER potential of approximately 1.26 V vs. RHE (sample 8; Fig. 1a, black curve), which corresponds to an overpotential of approximately 30 mV with respect to the oxidation of water molecules, was not obtained when no hematite was added to the sulfuric acid electrolyte (sample 1; Fig. 1a, blue curve), the hematite can clearly be unmasked as the source of this unusual voltage–current behavior of this electrode–electrolyte (H2SO4/Fe2O3 suspension) configuration.
The question, why hematite suspended in sulfuric acid ensures the enormously efficient and steadfast OER on Ni42 steel, i.e. the mechanism behind it, will be discussed. The discussion is basically limited to effects due to the existence of hematite and iron ions and their interactions in the system.
Hematite added to 0.5 M sulfuric acid does not solely end up in the formation of hematite particles suspended in clear electrolyte. It is known from the literature that hematite can, up to some extent, be dissolved in H2SO4.45 It turned out that stirring of 125 mL 0.5 M H2SO4 with 35 g Fe2O3 for 50000 s (Table S1;‡ sample 32) leads to the formation of a solution of Fe3+ ions based on 3.4 g of Fe2O3 found to be dissolved in sulfuric acid. To distinguish between the effect of free Fe3+ and suspended Fe2O3 particles on the OER properties of a Ni42 anode in an acidic medium, the suspension achieved after 50000 s of stirring hematite in sulfuric acid (35 g hematite; 125 mL 0.5 M H2SO4) was centrifuged and OER electrocatalysis was carried out with the clear supernatant solution (sample 32, Fig. 8).

Preparation of the electrolyte: 125 mL 0.5 M H2SO4 with 35 g Fe2O3 was stirred for 50000 s. The suspension was filtered and the filtrate was used as the electrolyte. The electrolyte contains about 3.4 g Fe2O3 dissolved in 125 mL 0.5 M H2SO4. Stirring rate: 4.5. 
The CP results of sample 32 are consistently comparable to those of sample 1 (Fig. 1a, blue curve) derived from electrolysis without adding solid Fe2O3. This clearly emphasizes that the sole presence of Fe3+ ions cannot account for the unusual OER behavior of Ni42 steel in sulfuric acid. Based on these results, and given the fact that the formation of free (dissolved) Fe3+ ions takes a considerable time after mixing of hematite with acid, the decrease of the potential (to E ∼ 1.26 V vs. RHE; Fig. 1a-black curve, Fig. S2, S3 and S5–S27‡) that takes place after e.g. 40000 s of the OER (Fig. 1a, black curve) to maintain an OER based current density of 30 mA cm−2 is very likely due to a simultaneous presence of Fe2O3 particles and free dissolved Fe3+ ions.
As can be seen in Fig. S2, S3 and S5–S27‡ displaying selected CP plots according to the experiments mentioned in Table S1,‡ the time that lasts until the low potential is finally reached, critically depends on (i) the stirring rate and (ii) the amount of hematite. With a constant amount of hematite it was found that the activation process can be accelerated with more intense stirring (Fig. 9a). At constant stirring speed, in turn, the desired voltage drop occurs earlier as the amount of hematite increases (Fig. 9b).
 Fig. 9  Influence of the stirring rate (a) and the amount of hematite (b) on the voltage current behavior of a hematite sulfuric acid suspension under oxygen evolution conditions. Current protocol: 0.3 A–10000 s; 0.15 A–600 s; 0.06 A–50000 s (see Table S1‡). Electrode area: 2 cm2; dimension of the stirring bar: 40 × 8 mm. A stirring rate of 1.0 corresponds to a speed of 100 per minute. 
Since both the amount of Fe2O3 and the stirring rate have a direct influence on the rate at which free Fe3+ ions are formed, or on the amount of iron oxide crystals present in the suspension, this result supports the assumption that the presence of free Fe3+ ions and solid Fe2O3 crystals plays an important role with respect to the voltage/current behavior of an anode in Fe2O3/H2SO4 suspensions. Furthermore, it seems to be logical that Fe3+ will be reduced to Fe2+ through reaction with the cathode on which H2 evolves during water electrolysis. In order to find an experimental proof for this claim we investigated the electrolyte after completion of electrolysis. The suspended solid was separated from the clear sulfuric acid by centrifugation. It turned out that the sulfuric acid, e.g. of samples 29, 36, 37, 38, 39, and 46 contained a substantial amount of Fe2+ ions as was proven by testing with K3[Fe(CN)6]3 solution (1 wt% in water), leading to a deep blue precipitation of Turnbull's blue which can be very well seen by the naked eye (Fig. S31a–e and g‡). A direct dissolution of hematite in sulfuric acid does not lead to the formation of Fe2+ in solution. Sample 42 represents stirring of 125 mL 0.5 M H2SO4 with 35 g of hematite for 50000 s without applying any current. As already shown (sample 32), a considerable amount of hematite is dissolved in sulfuric acid (3.4 g, see Table S1‡) while stirring. The filtrate of the suspension (35 g hematite/125 mL H2SO4) stirred (current less) for 50000 s did indeed, as expected, not contain Fe2+ ions, as can be seen from the brownish coloured solution without a Turnbull's blue precipitation after adding K3[Fe(CN)6]3 (see Fig. S31f‡).
We assume that Fe2+ ions existing in sulfuric acid have their origin in a cathodic reduction of Fe(III) that comes from the dissolution of hematite. However, “direct dissolution” of the steel electrode in H2SO4 may also produce free Fe2+ ions. To eliminate the fact that Fe2+ has its origin in a dissolution of the iron content of steel in sulfuric acid (there is still a mass deficit when comparing the weight of the steel anode before and after carrying out electrocatalysis), we replaced the steel anode by a graphite electrode and the Ni42 steel cathode by a platinum counter electrode in one of the experiments carried out with an Fe2O3/H2SO4 suspension (sample 43). Electrolysis was carried out as usual (Table S1‡) and the electrolyte was investigated. This set up exhibited a similar voltage current behaviour based on the final, constant potential (Fig. 10) as was found with Ni42 steel used as the WE and CE or when Ni42 was used as the WE and Pt as the CE (Fig. 1a, black curve) clearly underpinning the fact that Ni42 electrodes are, at least under these electrolysis conditions, suitable for the replacement of PGM electrodes but are obviously not responsible for the sophisticating OER properties, obtained when a Fe2O3/sulfuric acid mixture is used as the electrolyte.
 Fig. 10  Chronopotentiometric measurements carried out with a H2SO4/Fe2O3 suspension (125 mL 0.5 M H2SO4; 35 g Fe2O3) upon usage of a platinum CE and a graphite WE. Current protocol I (see Table S1‡). For details see the experimental part. 
The clear sulfuric acid obtained after electrolysis of a hematite/sulfuric acid electrolyte upon exploitation of a Pt and a graphite electrode contained Fe2+, as evidenced by K3[Fe(CN)6], which showed a Turnbull's Blue precipitation (Fig. S32‡). This finding suggests that actual dissolution of hematite and further reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ takes place in the electrolysis reaction of a hematite/H2SO4 suspension. Thus, the outcome from all the experiments mentioned so far can be reasonably interpreted this way: the simultaneous presence of free Fe2+/Fe3+ and suspended hematite particles plays a dominating role in the extraordinary electrocatalytic activity of the electrode/electrolyte system. We determined the concentration of Fe2+/Fe3+ and the amount of suspended oxide particles in the electrolyte subsequently after the potential to ensure an OER-based current density of 30 mA cm−2 dropped down to around 1.26 V vs. RHE, i.e. after completion of activation, upon redox titration (C(Fe2+)) and gravimetric analysis (total amount of Fe). It turned out that the “active” electrolyte consists of around 0.0036 mol L−1 Fe(II); 0.29 mol L−1 Fe(III); 32 g (undissolved) Fe2O3 particles and 125 mL 0.5 M H2SO4 (see Table S3, ESI‡).
As a result, the existence of free Fe2+/Fe3+ plus Fe2O3 suspended in 0.5 M H2SO4 (sample 44) right at the beginning of the chronopotentiometric experiment should lead to sufficiently low overpotentials. In fact, adding 1.5 g Fe(III)SO4 + 0.5 g Fe(II)SO4 + 30 g hematite to 125 mL 0.5 M H2SO4 led to a potential of 1.25 V vs. RHE required to ensure 30 mA cm−2 current density (Fig. S33‡). However 1000 s after mixing of the compounds (before completion of the current protocol I according to Table S1‡) this sample exhibited only weak OER and HER efficiency in the range between 13 and 15% (HER) and 16–17% (OER). It therefore seems to be very difficult to adjust the necessary Fe2+/Fe3+ concentration by adding soluble Fe(II)/Fe(III) salts. In addition, the interaction of free ions with suspended particles caused by an “electrochemical induction” (current protocol I) is the crucial prerequisite for advanced OER/HER properties. If the concentration of free Fe2+/Fe3+ is too high, oxygen evolution is suppressed and simple migration of Fe3+ to the cathode followed by reduction to Fe2+ and migration of Fe2+ to the anode followed by oxidation to Fe3+ are the dominating processes leading to relatively high currents at low potential. For example, the electrolysis of 0.5 M H2SO4 containing Fe3+ ions (c = 0.16 mol L−1) at 30 mA cm−2 (sample 41) over the entire course of the CP curve showed a potential below the standard Nernst potential for water oxidation (1.229 V vs. RHE). As a result, no oxygen bubble formation can be seen of on the surface of the anode (Fig. S34‡).
These experimental findings suggest that iron ions, which are somehow trapped by Fe oxide-based particles, play the key role in promoting the OER in the electrolysis of a Fe2O3/H2SO4 suspension.
The following equation applies to iron in oxidation state +2 in aqueous solution: [Fe(H2O)6]2+ + H2O ↔ [Fe(H2O)5OH]+ + H3O+(1)
In principle, we can confirm that a reaction between these aquo complexes and solid Fe2O3 finally results in the formation of a mixed valence iron oxide “Fe3O4”: [Fe(H2O)5OH]+ + Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 + 4H2O + H3O+(2) [Fe(H2O)6]2+ + Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 + 2H3O+ + 3H2O(3)
This is generally not as unusual as it seems, since it is known that Fe3O4 is formed by Fe3+/Fe2+ mixtures in aqueous solution at a low temperature.46 In addition, a reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 under wet-electrochemical conditions is currently being discussed in some articles.47 However, a direct interaction of free Fe2+ with free Fe3+ in aqueous solution (without the contribution of Fe2O3) which leads to Fe3O4, is very unlikely since, to our knowledge, this has not been achieved in acidic media.48

Eqn (3’) involving a mechano-electrochemical step can serve as a possible alternative to eqn (2) and (3) which seems more likely to exist.48 3Fe2O3 + 2H+ + 2e− → 2Fe3O4 + H2O(3′)
We furthermore assume that the mixed valence species Fe3O4 will be converted back, i.e. oxidized, while the anode comes in contact with Fe2O3 under the release of O2: (4)
As a result, the oxygen-evolving centers are likely to be on the oxide particles rather than on the electrode. In order to find a first indication of the correctness of this theory, we determined the consumption of hematite during electrolysis. After 341000 s of electrolysis at a current of 60 mA corresponding to 0.21 mol of electrons that passed through the electrolysis cell (sample 38), the solid residue (Fe2O3) was 31.31 g. As mentioned, a substantial portion of hematite (3.4 g of 35 g) is simply dissolved upon stirring (Table S1,‡ sample 32). Thus, the initial amount of Fe2O3 (35 g = 0.22 mol) was almost completely recovered.
However, this does not mean that the total amount of Fe2O3 is converted to Fe3O4 and vice versa. We rather assume that only a very small part of the material will be oxidized/reduced i.e. actually contributes to the catalysis reaction. It is therefore very likely that only the periphery of Fe2O3 particles suspended in sulfuric acid is covered by amorphous Fe3O4·H2O which is converted back to non-crystalline Fe2O3 which then covers the (predominantly) crystalline Fe2O3 particles.
It is important to note that the chemically bound oxygen in the hypothetically formulated active metal oxide species Fe3O4 comes from water molecules, i.e. the molecular oxygen released at the anode (eqn (4)) has its origin in water molecules (eqn (1)).
We therefore propose an electrocatalytically driven cyclic process involving molecular oxygen, water, and two different iron oxide species (Scheme 1):
 Scheme 1  A cyclic process ensures electrocatalytically initiated splitting of water mediated through two different oxide species. 
This means that Fe3O4 particles formed on the cathode have to migrate to the anode in order to be converted into Fe2O3 particles, which in turn have to migrate to the cathode in order to maintain the circulation. In other words, the migration of particles from the cathode compartment to the anode compartment and vice versa is required to maintain this cyclic process. This explains why cell designs that involve complete separation of the compartments from each other, e.g. by a Nafion membrane (PEM type electrolyzer) cannot lead to convincing results.
In order to clarify why the water splitting reaction mediated by an electrocatalytically driven cycle with suspended iron oxide species is advantageous compared to the classic electrolysis of clear electrolytes, the energy balances for the assumed electrochemical half-cell reactions have to be drawn up.
Two reactions are considered to take place simultaneously on the cathode, the mentioned reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ as well as the HER:
Cathode: Fe3+ + 3e− + 2H+ → Fe2+ + H2(5)
Reaction (4) (page 24) describes the oxidation of the Fe3O4 particles to Fe2O3 upon release of oxygen, and by adding up the electrochemically carried out reactions (4) and (5), the overall reaction (gross) can be defined as: Fe3O4 + 2H+ → Fe2O3 + Fe2+ + 0.5O2 + H2(6)
The standard reaction Gibbs energy ΔG0R can be most conveniently calculated using the standard Gibbs energy of formation (ΔG0f) for all compounds involved:49 H+ (0 kJ mol−1); Fe2+ (−78.9 kJ mol−1); Fe3+ (−4.7 kJ mol−1), H2 (0 kJ mol−1);O2 (0 kJ mol−1); Fe2O3 (−742.2 kJ mol−1); Fe3O4 (−1015.4 kJ mol−1). It should be noted that ΔG0f values of the iron oxide species belong to hematite and magnetite. The standard reaction Gibbs energy ΔG0R of the overall (gross) reaction amounts to 194.3 kJ mol−1 which corresponds to a difference of the standard half-cell potentials (ΔE) of 0.67 V.
The standard reaction Gibbs energy ΔG0R of the cathode half-cell reaction amounts to −74.2 kJ mol−1 which corresponds to a standard half-cell potential of +0.256 V vs. RHE. Given the difference of the standard half-cell potentials (ΔE = 0.67 V) the thermodynamic half-cell potential of the oxygen evolution reaction is +0.926 V vs. RHE which is significantly lower than the thermodynamic half-cell potential of the water oxidation reaction:H2O → 0.5O2 + 2H+ + 2e−, E0 = +1.229 V vs. RHE
This calculation is based on the Gibbs formation energies of the crystalline oxide species hematite and magnetite, and we currently do not know whether these are the real species that are involved in the electrocatalytically driven cyclic process. This is probably the main source of error for an inaccurate prediction of the expected potential. Nevertheless, this explains the general sense of this transition metal-oxide based strategy to reduce the oxygen evolution reaction potential.
Taking the low temperature into account, it is unlikely that when Fe2O3 reacts with Fe2+ crystalline Fe3O4 (magnetite) and when Fe3O4 is oxidized, crystalline Fe2O3 is formed. In fact, we have found no evidence that magnetite is formed in water electrolysis when a sulfuric acid/hematite mixture is used as the electrolyte. According to our own knowledge, even crystalline Fe3O4 (magnetite) shows considerable solubility in sulfuric acid (0.16 g in 125 mL 0.5 M H2SO4) based on our own findings. Therefore, even if crystalline Fe3O4 is temporarily formed by the reaction of hematite with Fe2+, its detection in the solid residue after completion of the electrolysis remains questionable. This is all the more true for amorphous Fe3O4, since it should have a much better solubility than crystalline Fe3O4. From the literature it is known that amorphous Fe3O4·H2O and Fe2O3·H2O can actually be formed in aqueous solution at room temperature.46
The water splitting reaction H2O → H2 + 0.5O2 naturally results from a combination of all chemically (1 and 2) and electrochemically (4 and 5) triggered reactions (Scheme S2, ESI‡).
FTIR spectroscopy spectra of the of the solid residue of the electrolyte of samples 26, 29, 30, 33, 37, 38, and 39 which were used for long term chronopotentiometry testing suggest that the originally used hematite remains unchanged after polarization measurements (Fig. S35 and S36‡).
X-ray powder diffraction patterns of samples 37, 38 and 39 do not differ from the one of hematite (ICSD 64599; Fig. S37‡). The appearance of strong reflexes is not evidence of the absence of amorphous iron oxide phases.50,51 The same samples (37–39) plus untreated hematite were subjected to a morphological examination via scanning electron microscopy (Fig. S38‡). We have to say that the hematite starting material can be viewed as nanoscale materials. However, in the case of all samples investigated, “square stone blocks” with an edge length in the range of 200 nm were obtained exhibiting no significant differences.
An XPS spectroscopic investigation did not exhibit significant differences between the hematite reference sample and the solid residue of samples 26, 29, 30, 33 and 37 (Fig. S39 and Table S1‡). The Fe 2p core level spectra are almost identical for all the samples and show a typical Fe3+ multiplet structure. The peak positions of Fe 2p3/2 (711.5 eV), the Fe3+ charge transfer satellite (719.3 eV) and Fe 2p1/2 (724.8 eV) agree very well with the values found for α-Fe2O3 quantum dots.52Ex situ (electro-oxidation-based) treatment has been successfully used to improve the electrocatalytic OER efficiency of Ni42 steel, as was reported earlier.23,53 Substantial amounts of metallic iron and nickel were found to exist in the surface of untreated Ni42 steel.53 The content of metallic nickel and iron was suppressed by the electro-activation carried out in the alkaline range.23,53 In particular Ni42 steel, to which positive potentials were applied i.e. which was used as an anode for more than 332000 s (∼92 h) in the electrolysis of a hematite/sulfuric acid suspension (sample 37) at 30 mA cm−2 current density, still shows a large proportion of metallic fractions of nickel and iron (Fig. 11a–e; spot 2). This is absolutely unusual and unique for steel electrodes which have been used as anodes in water electrolysis in general. Pioneering studies by the groups of Hoare, Pourbaix, and several others54–56, showed that in case of metal electrodes no oxygen can be released from the surface if the corresponding metal oxide is not formed. Regarding the XPS investigation of the Ni42 electrode, we followed the approach of Grosvenor et al.57 to separate the parts stemming from metallic Fe (green) (deconvoluted peak at 706.8 eV), Fe3O4 (purple) (deconvoluted peaks located at 708.4 eV, 709.7 eV, 710.7 eV, and 711.8 eV), and Fe2O3 (orange) (deconvoluted peaks located at 710.1 eV, 711.2 eV, 712.1 eV, and 713.2 eV). Apart from the significantly increased metal content, the high-resolution XPS (Fe 2p and Ni 2p) spectra of the Ni42 anode recorded after long term electrolysis (sample 37) did not substantially differ from XPS results derived from Ni42 electro-oxidized in an alkaline medium as reported in one of our earlier contributions.23

(b) Deconvoluted spectra stemming from metallic Fe (green) (deconvoluted peak at 706.8 eV), Fe3O4 (purple) (deconvoluted peaks located at 708.4 eV, 709.7 eV, 710.7 eV, and 711.8 eV), and Fe2O3 (orange) (deconvoluted peaks located at 710.1 eV, 711.2 eV, 712.1 eV, and 713.2 eV).

We claim that Ni3+ ions in the surface of Ni42 (which have their origin in the oxidation of Ni0 at strong oxidative potentials) are reduced by Fe3O4 particles in a mechano–chemical reaction to end up as Ni0, or in other words eqn (4) shows the electrons required to produce Ni metal via reduction of Ni(III) as seen by XPS spectroscopy.
Our finding (Fig. 11) indeed indicates that oxygen does not come directly “out of the electrode”, i.e. oxygen evolution centers are formed at the periphery of the particles at the moment the particles touch the electrode. Thus, the evolution of oxygen is mediated by the particle itself. As mass loss of the anode is known to occur especially when oxygen evolution is promoted on its surface, this would explain the low weight loss of the anode during long term operation in water electrolysis (Table S1‡).
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has been performed at 293 K and 15 K with (the solid residue of) samples 26, 29, 30, 33, 36, 37, 38 and 39 (Fig. S40‡), and on reference samples, composed of 100% hematite (ref. 1) or 95% hematite/5% magnetite (ref. 2). Noteworthy: the solid residue of samples 37–39 originated from the activation step (35 g of hematite in 125 mL of 0.5 M H2SO4; current protocol I) followed by long term electrolysis of the suspension-based electrolyte at a current density of 30 mA cm−2 (current protocol II) whereas (the solid residue of) all other investigated samples represent hematite used as an additive (4.6–7 g in 125 mL of 0.05 M H2SO4) to the electrolyte (exploited for carrying out long term electrolysis according to current protocol II at 10 mA cm−2 (Table S1‡)). The EPR spectra for both temperatures reveal clear differences between samples 26, 29, 30, 33 and 36, and samples 37–39. The first set of samples is characterized by EPR spectra exhibiting single, slightly asymmetric broad lines with an almost Lorentzian shape that largely resemble that of pure hematite (ref. 1) with a reduced linewidth observed for samples 29–36. Nevertheless, additional features appear in the spectra recorded at 15 K with g values of ∼2.0 and ∼4.5, indicative for the presence of Fe3+ in a low symmetry environment.58,59 Strikingly, for samples 37–39 the broad hematite EPR line has a significantly reduced amplitude and the additional features become prominent with an additional small signal appearing at g = 9.3. These spectral features suggest that upon hydrolysis of a hematite suspension Fe3+ ions intercalate into Fe2O3, ending up in predominantly axially coordinated sites.60,61 Notably, the intensity of these spectral features is comparable between the two sets of samples, indicating that about the same amount of Fe3+ ions is incorporated into the Fe2O3 lattice, which on the other hand appears to be significantly influenced in samples 37–39. The spectra recorded for these samples at 296 K show the presence of at least two spectral components with different resonance positions and linewidths. One of these components (being strongest in sample 37) resembles that of pure hematite, whereas the other component(s) is strongly shifted towards higher g values, indicating an altered iron coordination in the hematite lattice. Nevertheless, the presence of the g ∼ 4.5 and g ∼ 2 signals in samples 26–36 with similar intensity largely rules out that the intercalated Fe3+ is solely responsible for rearrangement of the hematite lattice. A comparison with a reference sample containing 5% crystalline magnetite (ref. 2), that shows remarkably different EPR line shapes, indicates that no crystalline Fe3O4 is formed.
These results may therefore serve to underpin the fact that the proposed reaction of iron ions with hematite finally results in the formation of amorphous iron oxide species.
To get more insight into the proposed Fe3O4 participation in the electrolysis of a hematite/Fe2O3 mixture, we carried out an electrolysis step of a sulfuric acid/Fe2O3/Fe3O4 (125 mL 0.5 M/32 g/1.1 g; sample 45) mixture at a constant current density of 30 mA cm−2 upon usage of two Ni42 electrodes. The potential required to ensure a constant current density of 30 mA cm−2 was found to be, from the very start of the measurements, very close to the constant value (Fig. 12) to which it (after some hours) dropped down when only hematite was used as an additive to the clear electrolyte (Fig. 1a, black curve). This finding supports our assumption that electrocatalysis of a hematite/H2SO4 suspension might occur through a temporary formation of Fe3O4 species.
 Fig. 12  Chronopotentiometric measurements carried out with a H2SO4/Fe2O3/Fe3O4 suspension (125 mL 0.5 M H2SO4; 32 g Fe2O3; 1.1 g Fe3O4) upon usage of a platinum CE and a graphite WE. Current protocol I (see Table S1‡). For details see the experimental part. 
In a final experiment we wanted to shed light on a potential depleting path for Fe3O4 which could also be useful to clarify its role during electrolysis of iron-oxide-sulfuric acid suspensions. Electrolysis of a H2SO4/Fe3O4 suspension (125 mL/10 g; sample 46) according to the standard current protocol I (Table S1‡) with a total duration of 60600 s resulted in a mass loss of 3 g, i.e. 30% of the magnetite was spent. This is significantly more than the amount that is simply dissolved in sulfuric acid (0.16 g in 125 mL 0.5 M H2SO4) under current-less conditions. This cannot be regarded as hard proof for the correctness of reaction (4) as neither crystalline Fe3O4 was detected in the originally performed electrolysis of hematite/H2SO4 suspensions, nor was crystalline Fe2O3 proven to exist in the solid residue after completion of this electrolysis of magnetite/H2SO4 suspension. Nevertheless, it can be considered as a proof of concept and as such it suggests the correctness of an electrocatalysis-based depletion route for magnetite (that is temporarily/in situ formed), as a depletion of magnetite solely based on a simple dissolution procedure would not lead to such a substantial loss of Fe3O4.
Conclusions
The efficient, economic, durable and environmentally friendly storage of electricity remains one of the big challenges modern society has to cope with. The battery solution can only be considered as an interim solution due to serious constraints like self-discharge, a decrease in storage capacity as the number of charge–discharge cycles increases, and an environmental impact in the production of lithium, just to name a few. For good reason, water electrolysis is the most pathbreaking energy storage technique and if sourced by green energy, allows a CO2 footprint free access to super clean hydrogen, the energy carrier of the future. So far, two serious problems related to electrocatalytically triggered water splitting remain unsolved. (1) A substantial overpotential on the anode which keeps the cell voltage, the potential difference between the cathode and anode, high and, as a direct consequence, the overall efficiency low. (2) Current energy conversion units must be resistant to frequent changes in the electricity load. Among the various techniques currently available (with respect to water-splitting based ones), only those of the proton exchange membrane type can meet these requirements. PEM electrolyzers however require acidic electrolytes and all known electrode materials (even the noble ones!) are unstable in acids when positive potentials are applied. We have suggested an alternative electrolysis setup that takes advantage of simple steel as anode material and an electrolyte that solely consists of a hematite/H2SO4 suspension. To ensure a semi-cell-separation both electrodes are inserted into plastic cartridges which still allows particles to flow from the anode room to the cathode room and vice versa (Fig. 6). The potential at which powerful oxygen evolution takes place is fascinatingly low (1.26 V vs. RHE at 30 mA cm−2 current density, pH0). Moreover, the overall cell voltage is fascinatingly low (1.6 V at 30 mA cm−2 current density, pH0). The low weight-loss, determined for Ni42 after 50000 s of CP at 30 mA cm−2 current density is unparalleled (22 μg mm−2). Experiments suggest that Fe2O3 is converted to a Fe(II)/Fe(III) oxide species on the cathode which is then reconverted to (likely amorphous) Fe2O3 upon release of molecular oxygen on the anode. Thus, an electrocatalytically driven cyclic process involving molecular oxygen, water, and two different iron oxide species makes possible the splitting of water molecules in the gross reaction with almost incredible efficiency.
Experimental section
Preparation of samples 1–23
Electrolysis was performed in a 150 mL glass beaker upon usage of a WE prepared from Ni42 steel (Schmiedetechnik Faulenbach, Wiehl, Germany) with a total geometry of 100 × 10 × 1.5 mm steel on which an apparent surface area of 2 cm2 was defined by an insulating tape (Kapton tape). Fig. S41‡ shows the analysis certificate of Ni42 steel. Pre-treatment: prior to electrolysis the surface of the metal was cleaned intensively with ethanol and polished with grit 600 SiC sanding paper. Afterwards the surface was rinsed intensively with deionised water and dried in air for 5 h. The weight was determined using a precise balance (Sartorius 1712, 0.01 mg accuracy) prior to polarization. A platinum wire electrode (4.5 cm2 geometric area) was employed as the CE, and a reversible hydrogen reference electrode (RHE, HydroFlex, Gaskatel Gesellschaft für Gassysteme durch Katalyse und Elektrochemie mbH. D-34127 Kassel, Germany) was utilized as the reference standard; therefore, all voltages are quoted against this reference electrode (RE). The RHE was placed in between the WE and the CE. The distance between the WE and RHE was 2 mm. Sulfuric acid (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany; C = 0.5 mol L−1; 125 mL) was filled in the glass beaker and in case of samples 1–5 and 9–23 the corresponding amount of hematite (325 mesh, Alfa Aesar, Kandel, Germany, See Table S1‡) was (additionally) added under strong stirring. Fig. S42‡ shows the analysis certificate of hematite. Immediately, the three electrodes were immersed into the electrolyte in a way that complete coverage of the platinum electrode and the defined area of the WE were ensured. The electrolyte was stirred via a stirring bar (40 × 8 mm). The stirring rate was adjusted according to Table S1.‡ A stirring rate of 1.0 corresponds to 100 per min. For preparation of the samples, electrolysis was realized upon applying a chronopotentiometry protocol (current protocol I, Table S1‡). After completion of the CP the anode was taken out of the electrolyte, washed with deionised water and dried in an oven at 42 °C. Again, the weight was determined using a precise balance (Sartorius 1712, 0.01 mg accuracy). The electrolyte was centrifuged and the clear acid analysed via ICP-OES. The solid residue was dried in an over under air at 45 °C for 24 hours. FTIR spectroscopic, photon electron-spectroscopic and electron pair resonance spectroscopic investigations have been carried out with the powder.
