The catalyst system is prepared by simple mixing of the components and is therefore easy to apply in organic synthesis. As light sources, commercial high power LEDs or sunlight are used. We report the optimization of the reaction conditions, the effect of trace amounts of added metal salts and demonstrate the use of green light photoreduction in the conversion of several nitrobenzene derivatives.IntroductionSunlight is our largest energy resource by far. Photovoltaic systems for the conversion of solar energy into electrical power have already evolved into a wide range of applications.1 Photocatalysts, which utilize light to drive chemical reactions,2 are less developed and typical applications are the photodegradation of organic pollutants with TiO2 and UV irradiation in waste water treatment3 or self-cleaning surfaces.4 Large scale photocatalytic fuel generation,5e.g. by water splitting,6 still lacks endurance and efficiency, but photocatalytic fine chemical synthesis has been achieved. Recent examples of homogeneous photocatalysis7 include alkyne hydrogenation,8 the direct asymmetric alkylation of aldehydes,9 enantioselective cyclisation reactions10 and methanol addition to glycals.11 Heterogeneous photocatalysts are typically based on doped TiO212 or TiO2 sensitized by dyes13 to extend its absorption beyond the UV range. Cadmium sulfide-based photocatalysts have been developed for the synthesis of unsaturated α-cyano-homoallyl amines from imines and olefins.14 In addition, metal complexes15 and metals16 are deposited on TiO2 to increases its photocatalytic efficiency.17 A recent example of the application of sensitized TiO2 photocatalysis to organic synthesis is the TEMPO-mediated aerobic oxidation of alcohols using blue light irradiation and oxygen,18 whereas non-modified TiO2 was used to mediate the oxidative addition of THF to quinolines.11Here, we describe photocatalytic reductions of nitrobenzene derivatives using green LED light irradiation or sun light. Our simple but effective heterogeneous photocatalysts are derived from commercial Degussa P25 TiO2, ruthenium complex N3 and trace amounts of added metal salts. The catalyst preparation is achieved by simple mixing and does not require any special procedures. The photoconversions of organic substrates are very clean, as verified by gas chromatography monitoring, and, in many cases, quantitative.Results and discussionThe photoreduction of nitrobenzenes to anilines19 has been reported using TiO2 and UV irradiation20 or transition metal-doped TiO2 and visible blue light,21 but these conditions still show some disadvantages: a sunlight-mediated reduction is typically not effective, the reported TONs with respect to the added metal catalysts are below 1000, partial conversions and side-product formation are observed, and metal-doped titanium dioxide must be specially prepared.22As in a Grätzel cell (dye sensitized solar cell),23 we have used commercial TiO2, which was surface-functionalized by a Ru-complex, to absorb green light; this region of the solar spectrum has the highest intensity. Scheme 1 shows the proposed mechanism of the photoreduction process: The excited dye injects electrons into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. Added transition metal ions are reduced by the TiO2, form clusters and mediate the reduction of nitroarene substrates, which are reduced to anilines. The catalytic cycle is closed by TEOA oxidation to reduce the dye. Scheme 1  Proposed mechanism of green-light-mediated reduction of nitrobenzenes by dye-sensitized TiO2 and transition metal clusters. TEOA: triethanolamine. High power LEDs with a narrow emission wavelength bandwidth (530 ± 10 nm) and a high light intensity of more than 60 lm, generated from approximately 3 W electrical power according to their specifications, are used as energy-efficient light sources to drive the catalysis. Fig. 1 shows the experimental set up. Fig. 1  Reaction vials irradiated by an array of high power green light LEDs. The photocatalysts were prepared by deposition of the ruthenium complex N3 on P-25 TiO2 (8 × 10−8 mmol mg−1) followed by addition of different amounts of transition metals (see Experimental section for details). A solution of nitrobenzene [c = 8 × 10−2 mol L−1] in acetonitrile (2.5 mL) and 50 mg of the TiO2 photocatalyst was irradiated with a 3 W green LED at room temperature for 24 h. The reaction conversion was monitored by gas chromatography (GC) and GC/MS analysis.Irradiation of unmodified TiO2 at 530 nm leads to low nitrobenzene conversions of about 2% (Table 1, entry 2). TiO2 modified with N3 but with no deposited transition metal ions gave conversions of nitrobenzene to aniline of 39% (Table 1, entry 3). No conversion was detected without green light irradiation or by irradiating N3 without TiO2 (Table 1, entry 1). The addition of small amounts of transition metal ions to the reaction mixture led to a significant enhancement of the photocatalytic activity: 67% conversion for 0.1 mol% and 51% for 0.001 mol% K2PtCl6 (Table 1, entries 7, 8 and 9). Quantitative conversions of nitrobenzene to aniline were observed with 0.1 mol% of Pt(II) or even smaller amounts of Pd(II) salts. A similar effect in non-sensitized reactions has been previously reported for silver clusters deposited on TiO2.21 Systematic variation of the transition metals, their amounts and the method of their reduction revealed a relationship between the nature of the metal and the optimal catalytic amount (Table 1): quantitative conversions >99% are observed for 0.5–0.01 mol% using Pt(II) and Pd(II), while reduced Pt(IV) and Ag(I) salts did not lead to complete conversions under the experimental conditions, with the best results of 67% for 0.1 mol% Pt(IV) and 65% for 0.1 mol% Ag(I).

On the other hand, photochemically-prepared Pt colloids showed quantitative conversion of nitrobenzene to aniline in the range 10−1–10−6 mol% (Table 1, entries 4–8). The photocatalytic activity depends on the oxidation state of the platinum source, which is either Pt(IV), Pt(II) or Pt(0). This has been observed earlier by Remita et al. in photodegradations by platinum-doped TiO2: under visible light irradiation, the photodegradation activities followed the order Pt cluster > Pt(II) ≫ Pt(IV) and was explained by the ability of the Pt clusters to act as weak temporary electron scavengers.24 Using Au(III) salts led to quantitative conversions at 10−1 and 10−4 mol%. For every metal salt, an optimum quantity range was found. All were below 1 mol%, some as low as 10−4 mol%. Amounts higher than 1 mol% decreased the catalytic activity. Ozin et al. recently reported that the size distribution of deposited platinum clusters on TiO2 depends on the platinum loading, and that the photocatalytic activity of the material in photodecomposition increased beyond a critical cluster size of 2 nm.25 TEM pictures from our reaction solutions with the optimum catalytic amounts for Pt(II) and Pd(II) in 10−2 mol% and Au(III) in 10−4 mol% showed a similar morphology for each of the resulting particles (Fig. 2). No transition metal particles were found on the surface of TiO2. This indicates that (a) for every transition metal, a specific amount is needed to get the optimum particle size for the photocatalytic reduction under these conditions and (b) the active catalyst is prepared heterogeneously, but the reduction reaction is homogeneously mediated by nanometer size metal clusters. Fig. 2  TEM-pictures of nanoparticles found in solution after the photocatalytic reduction (a) 0.01 mol% Pt(II), (b) 0.01 mol% Pd(II) and (c) 0.0001 mol% Au(III). The reactions in Table 1 correspond to minimum turnover numbers of 1000 for Pt(II) (0.1 mol%), 9996 for Pd(II) (0.01 mol%) and 995900 for Au(III) (10−4 mol%). The selective green light irradiation requires longer irradiation times for complete conversion compared to UV experiments; however, no side products of the reduction were detected when analyzing the samples by GC and GC-MS (see Fig. 3). A quantum efficiency of 8% was determined for the reduction reaction under the optimized conditions. Fig. 3  Gas-chromatographic analyses of nitrobenzene reductions. Toluene was used as internal standard. Upper trace: entry 9, Table 1, Pt(0) from UV reduction, 72% conversion; lower trace: entry 8, Table 1, Pt(II) from Vis reduction, 99%. To demonstrate the use of the green light photoreduction on a laboratory preparative scale, 2 × 10−3 mmol of nitrobenzene were reduced and the product was isolated by distillation (Table 1, entries 12 and 13). Quantitative conversions and high yields were obtained for 0.1 mol% Pd2+ and Pt2+ and for 0.0001 mol% of Au3+ when irradiating the samples for 36 h.As the composition of our catalyst system is similar to reported hydrogen-generating photocatalysts, consisting in the simplest case of a ruthenium complex, an electron mediator and colloidal palladium, we suspected hydrogen as an intermediate and the chemical reduction reagent. Gas chromatographic analyses of the head space of a reaction sample using the conditions of entry 9, Table 1 for 0.1 mol% Pd2+, clearly showed the presence of 6% hydrogen gas after 10 h of irradiation. We therefore conclude that the role of the metal clusters in our catalytic system is twofold: they accept electrons from the conduction band of the TiO2 and generate dihydrogen by reduction of protons provided by the TEOA,26 but they also catalyze the hydrogenation of the organic substrate. Monitoring the photoreduction (see Experimental section for data) shows an induction period for the reaction of about 8–12 h. A likely explanation for this observation is the necessary formation of the reduced metal clusters and the build up of a hydrogen gas pressure before an effective substrate conversion starts.After the optimization of the reaction conditions, the substrate scope was investigated. Table 2 summarizes the results for standard reaction conditions of 24 h irradiation at room temperature. Ethyl 4-nitrobenzoate, 4-nitrobenzonitril, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and 4-bromonitrobenzene are reduced to the corresponding anilines, with smaller amounts of added K2PtCl6 giving better conversions under the experimental conditions. No reduction of the aldehyde functional group is observed. In the case of 4-bromonitrobenzene, dehalogenation occurs as a competing process at high platinum concentrations. No other side products were detected by GC analysis for the photoreductions. 4-Nitrophenol is not reduced under the experimental conditions and 1,4-dinitrobenzene gives nitroaniline, but only in small yields.27 In contrast, 1,2-dinitrobenzene is reduced to 2-nitroaniline in good yields with small amounts of the corresponding nitrohydroxylamine as a side product. 2-Nitrobenzaldehyde and 2-nitroacetophenone are reduced to the corresponding anilines. However, depending on the amount of platinum salt added the corresponding 1,2-benzisoxazole becomes the major product. The preparation of 1,2-benzisoxazoles has been previously described using 2–5 equivalents of indium as the reduction reagent.28

However, pyridine-4-carbaldehyde is reduced to the corresponding benzyl alcohol in up to 80%. The reduction of stilbene to 1,2-diphenylethane is possible under the reaction conditions, but the conversions remain incomplete within 24 h.The photocatalyst system absorbs in the most intense region of the solar spectrum and is therefore suitable to work in sun light. Photocatalytic reduction reactions using the standard apparatus and a TiO2/N3/K2PtCl6 photocatalyst were performed at different weather conditions with daylight and sun irradiation (late summer, south of Germany). Table 3 summarizes the results. On a rainy and overcast day, the conversion in nitrobenzene reduction is, as expected, only small. However, with increasing sunshine the nitrobenzene conversion reached 80% and maximal TON, with respect to the added platinum catalyst, of more than 67000 after 11 h.

The catalysts are simple to prepare and apply, and allow the complete, selective and clean conversion of nitrobenzene derivatives to the corresponding anilines. The use of green light irradiation of low energy avoids the formation of unwanted side products and rapid catalyst decomposition. Optimization studies revealed the amount of transition metal salts initially added to be critical for effective catalysis, as it determines the size of the in situ-formed nanoparticles. Their activity as hydrogen evolution and hydrogenation catalysts is size dependent, as known from other studies.The described photocatalyst may find applications in synthesis, as the metal salts exhibit some selectivities in the reduction reaction and conversions can be performed using energy-efficient high power green light LEDs or direct sunlight.ExperimentalSynthesis of the ruthenium complex-modified titanium dioxide4,4′-Dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine (1)29. 4,4′-Dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridyl (2 g, 10.9 mmol) in 50 mL conc. H2SO4 was heated to 70 °C. At this temperature, K2Cr2O4 (9.6 g, 33 mmol) was added slowly and the solution stirred for another hour at this temperature. The hot solution was poured into 300 mL crushed ice and stirred for 1 h. The green-yellow solid was filtered and washed with 2 × 50 mL water. The yellow residue was refluxed in 50% HNO3 for 4 h, cooled to room temperature and poured into 300 mL crushed ice. Crystals were obtained from this water phase over night.The solid was filtered and dried at high vacuum (8 × 10−2 mbar) for 4 h at room temperature. A colourless solid (2.3 g) was obtained (yield: 87%; lit29: 90%). Mass analysis and melting point were identical to the reported data: m/z = 244.1; m.p. = 97 °C.cis-Diaquadithiocyanatobis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate)-ruthenium(II) (N3)30,31. 4,4′-Dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine 1 (2.3 g, 9.4 mmol) and RuCl3·H2O (1.01 g, 4.5 mmol) were suspended in 25 mL DMF and refluxed overnight. DMF was evaporated, the dark solid dried at high vacuum (5 × 10−2 mbar, room temperature) for 2 h. The solid (1.28 g) was used without further purification, dissolved in 160 mL DMF, and a solution of NaOH (430 mg, 10.6 mmol) in 100 mL H2O was added. NaSCN (1.93 g, 23.8 mmol) in 11 mL H2O was added dropwise under argon and the solution was allowed to reflux for 6 h. The solvents were evaporated, the crude residue dissolved in 100 mL H2O and acidified to pH = 2 by HClO4. The dark red solid was filtered, dried at high vacuum and stored in the dark. 1.1 g of a dark solid (2) was obtained (yield: 80%, lit31: 80%). UV and ESI-MS data of complex 2 were identical to reported values: m/z = 724.1 (M + NH4+): UV-VIS (MeCN): λmax (nm)/ε (M−1 cm−1) = 546/14.000; 401/13.800; 316/31.000.Dye immobilization on TiO2. TiO2 (4 g, 50 mmol) and dye N3 (229 mg, 3.2 × 10−4 mol) were suspended in 25 mL MeCN and stirred for 12 h in the dark under an argon atmosphere. The solvent was evaporated and the remaining violet solid dried at high vacuum (2 × 10−2 mbar).General procedure for the reduction of nitrobenzene derivatives and alkenesA mixture of the nitro compound or alkene (2 × 10−4 mmol), TiO2 with N3 (50 mg, containing 4 × 10−6 mol N3), stock solution of the transition metal salt, TEOA (2 × 10−3 mol) and 2.5 mL MeCN were transferred into a glass vial. The reaction mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen, evacuated and allowed to warm up to room temperature at 50 mbar. The procedure was repeated and finally the reaction vial was flushed with nitrogen. The sample was irradiated with a high power LED (Luxeon, 3 W, 530 nm) for 24 h. 500 μL of the reaction mixture were diluted with 500 μL of 6.7 × 10−2 M stock solution of toluene in MeCN as standard. Analytical data of all isolated compounds corresponded to literature values.General procedure for the large-scale reduction of nitrobenzeneA mixture of the nitrobenzene (2 × 10−3 mmol), TiO2 with N3 (500 mg, containing 4 × 10−5 mol N3), stock solution of the transition metal salt, TEOA (2 × 10−2 mol) and 10 mL MeCN was transferred into a glass vial. The reaction mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen, evacuated and allowed to warm up to room temperature at 150 mbar. The procedure was repeated and finally the reaction vial was flushed with nitrogen. The sample was irradiated with a high power LED (Luxeon, 3 W, 530 nm) for 36 h. The N3/TiO2 was filtered off over Celite, the filtrate was evaporated and distilled under high vacuum. Analytical data of all isolated compounds corresponded to literature values.Gas chromatographic analysesMonitoring of the reaction and product analysis was performed by gas chromatographic analysis (GC 5890 Series II from Hewlett-Packard, capillary column J+W Scientific—DB-5MS/30 m × 0.25 mm/0.25 μm film). The structures of the products were confirmed by comparison with standard samples and by GC-MS analyses (GC-MS 5973 MSD from Agilent Technologies, capillary column from Agilent 19091S-433 HP-5MS/30 m × 0.25 mm/0.25 μm film).Reaction kineticsA mixture of the nitro compound (2 × 10−4 mmol), TiO2 with N3 (50 mg, containing 4 × 10−6 mol N3), stock solution of the transition metal salt, TEOA (2 × 10−3 mol) and 2.5 mL MeCN were transferred into a glass vial. The reaction mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen, evacuated and allowed to warm up to room temperature at 50 mbar. The procedure was repeated and finally the reaction vial was flushed with nitrogen. The mixture was irradiated with a high power LED (Luxeon, 3 W, 530 nm) for 1 h. To monitor the reaction progress, 20 μL samples of the reaction mixture were taken and diluted with 20 μL of 6.7 × 10−2 M stock solution of toluene in MeCN as standard and analyzed by GC.TEM material and methodThe sample solution drops were placed on Formvar- and carbon-coated positive glow-discharge treated copper grid (400 mesh) and subsequently blotted dry with filter paper. The samples were examined in a LEO912AB electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) operating at 100 kV, equipped with a bottom-mounted CCD-camera capable to record images with 1k × 1k pixels. The documentation was done with the iTEM software, ver. 5.0 (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions GmbH, Muenster, Germany).
