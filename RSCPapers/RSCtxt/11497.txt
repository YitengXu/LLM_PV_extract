However, challenges remain in the improvement of electrode materials toward high capacitive performance. Electrospun nanofibers, prepared via facile and low-cost electrospinning techniques, exhibit superior electrochemical performance in SCs due to their unique morphology and intriguing properties, demonstrating great potential for improving the performance of SCs. Herein, we review the recent progress in electrospun one-dimensional nanofibers as electrode materials for SCs. Three categories of electrospun electrode nanomaterials (i.e., carbon nanofibers, carbon nanofiber composites, and carbon-free transition metal oxides) are discussed with design and optimization strategies. Moreover, critical insights into the electronic conductivity, electrochemical response and durability of electrospun nanofibers are reviewed.

1. Introduction
Green renewable energy storage and conversion systems are of great importance for next-generation energy technologies to address the current challenges, such as fossil fuel consumption and environmental issues.1–7 One of the most promising solutions is supercapacitors (SCs), which offer various advantages, such as, rapid charging, admirable cycle life, affordable cost, safety and the ability to bridge the power/energy gap between conventional capacitors and batteries/fuel cells.8–13 However, current SCs (double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors) usually involve relatively low energy densities and slow rate capabilities mainly due to a deficiency in electrode materials, impeding their further practical application in large-scale energy storage systems.14–17 Therefore, the main target in this field is to develop electrode materials with high specific capacity and outstanding cycling performance for SCs.
Over the past few decades, tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring advanced nanostructured electrodes for SCs due do their unique merits such as a large surface area, abundant active sites, a short ion diffusion length, controllable surface chemistry, facile stress relaxation processes, etc.18,19 These novel nanostructures have greatly contributed to the gradually improved performance of SCs, such as carbonaceous materials for EDLCs20–27 and conducting polymers and transition metal oxides for pseudocapacitors.28–35 Nevertheless, most nanostructured electrodes still suffer from several issues, including time-consuming, complicated fabrication processes, limited utilization of active sites and unsatisfactory compositional adaptability. To overcome the above-mentioned problems, a rational design of the morphology, surface chemistry, and electronic structure of SC electrodes is a forceful approach to enhance the electrochemical performance.
Unlike traditional nanostructured materials, one-dimensional (1D) nanofibers present extraordinary lengths, favourable mechanical strength and efficient electron transport, which allow for their wide application range.36,37 Moreover, quantum effects are unique in 1D structures, resulting in new electronic properties, which made them quite suitable as functional materials for electronic devices.38 In addition, 1D nanofibers are extremely flexible in creating unique structures that are modified with defects, functional groups and other active materials, which is meaningful to tackle challenges in the development of current SCs.39–45 Particularly, as the leader of nanofiber materials, fabricated by a simple, versatile, and proficient electrospinning technique, electrospun nanofibers offer a number of extra advantages: (1) appealing characteristics (rich and uniform porosity, admirable aspect ratio, large surface area, tuneable wettability, fine flexibility, good connectivity, and unidirectional flow of electrons); (2) easy tuning of their morphologies and properties through the optimization of precursor solution, processing parameters and setup geometries; (3) facile preparation at the lab scale and promising to be manufactured on an industrial scale from various materials; (4) acting as freestanding electrodes without using conductive agents and binders; (5) additional improvement of electrospun nanofibers can be easily realized via post-electrospinning treatments (solvothermal method, calcination, electrodeposition, chemical vapour deposition, etc.). Therefore, electrospun 1D nanofibers have demonstrated their great potential as electrode materials for improving the performance of SCs.
So far, several review papers have discussed electrospinning and electrospun nanofibers,46 renewable energy technologies and their applications based on electrospun nanofibrous materials,47 advanced electrical energy storage systems based on electrospun nanostructured electrodes,48 electrospun nanofiber materials for lithium–sulphur batteries,49 and electrospun nanomaterials for SC electrodes.50 However, few reviews have summarized the exciting developments and significant achievements in state-of-the-art electrospun 1D nanofibers as SC electrode materials. Moreover, regarding the structure and chemistry viewpoints, there is extensively growing interest in using CNF-based composites prepared via electrospinning for SC applications. Accordingly, it is timely and necessary to present current updates on recent advances in developing electrospun electrode nanomaterials for SC applications including CNFs, CNF-based composites and carbon-free transition metal oxides.
In this review, we first introduce various strategies used for the preparation and reinforcement of CNFs regarding the structure and chemistry viewpoints. Then, how CNFs can be used as a host/substrate to hybridize with other active materials, forming CNF-based composites with synergies that enhance the overall electrochemical performance, is discussed. Third, we discuss important studies on carbon-free transition metal oxides as electrode materials for SCs. Meanwhile, a framework for rationalizing SC electrode material design and reflecting current research trends is described. Finally, open challenges and other important future directions are outlined.
2. Fundamentals of electrospinning
Generally, the setup for electrospinning consists of the following parts: a high-voltage power supply, a syringe pump, a spinneret (usually a hypodermic needle with a blunt tip), and a conductive collector (Fig. 1a). During electrospinning, a static DC high-voltage is usually applied between the spinneret and conductive collector to generate an electric field; as for the AC power supply, it usually brings about a decrease in electrostatic repulsion since AC power carries alternating segments of charges with opposite polarity to the jet. Upon electrification, the extruded droplet brings about surface tension, and the electrostatic repulsion shares the same sign among the surface charges, inducing a deformation of a conical shaped droplet (Taylor cone). When the electrostatic force overcomes the surface tension, a liquid jet from the tip of Taylor cone ejects and elongates in a straight line and then undergoes vigorous whipping motions because of bending instabilities. As a result, the jet is stretched into finer diameters, and it solidifies quickly, leading to the deposition of long and thin threads on the grounded collector; finally, an electrospun non-woven mat is obtained after this process.51–54

Furthermore, the structures and components of electrospun nanofibers can be controlled by three basic aspects during the electrospinning process: (a) the precursor solution; for example, by blending different components with a certain ratio in precursor solution, various 1D continuous nanofibers with different components can be facilely prepared (Fig. 1b). Moreover, other parameters of the spinnable solution like the viscosity and type of solvent are also significant for the quality of the prepared nanofibers; (b) the processing/operating parameters like the applied voltage, feeding rate, temperature, humidity, etc., are indirect factors that influence the morphologies of these electrospun nanofibers, and these parameters usually have an appropriate range or even a critical value; for example, both high and low voltage can lead to more defect like beads and inhomogeneity of the as-spun nanofibers, which could greatly reduce the properties of nanofibers; (c) the setup geometries, such as the needle gauge, the needle-tip/collector distance and the shape of the collector, are also important factors for tailoring the nanofibers to different needs. For instance, using a multi-nozzle can greatly enrich the components and structures of electrospun nanofibers (Fig. 1b).55–61
As aforementioned, the different, tuneable parameters enable electrospinning to freely produce nanofibers endowed with unique physicochemical properties and outstanding characteristics.62,63 Conventional single-nozzle electrospinning as the most common electrospinning method offers a straightforward route to construct diverse structures of 1D nanofibers in different fields. (1) Solid structures: for instance, high toughness and tensile strength yarn can be obtained via the electrospinning method.64 (2) Porous structures: in general, both gas generation during heat treatment and template removal can result in rich pores in nanofibers. Liu et al.65 reported CNFs with unique hierarchical pore structures through electrospinning and metal ion-assisted acid corrosion processes. Moreover, a binary system of poly(lactic acid)-dichloromethane also created rich porosity (Fig. 2a).68 (3) Necklace-like structures: as shown in Fig. 2b, electrospun PVA/SiO2 fibers can be prepared by the electrospinning method with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as the template polymer in the spinning solution.69 (4) Nanobelts/ribbon-like structures: Mali et al.74 fabricated SnO2 nanobelts as an electron transport layer for perovskite solar cells by the annealing treatment of as-spun polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)/SnO2 nanofibers. Continuous NiO–Co3O4 nanobelts with superior charge storage properties were reported by Jose et al.;75 the nanobelts showed a high surface area, which is more than six-fold that of cylindrical fibers. Typically, the prepared nanobelts/ribbons are often bent, as shown in Fig. 2c.70

Coaxial electrospinning, by adjusting the number of capillaries in the spinneret, can be applied to the fabrication of core–shell, hollow and multichannel materials. (1) Core–shell: Wang et al.76 reported porous CNFs with micropores in the inner capillary and mesopores in the outer capillary. Besides, nanowire-in-microtube structured core/shell fibers were also reported (Fig. 2d).72 (2) Hollow structures: by removing material like mineral oil in the core of core–shell nanofibers, a hollow structure can be easily obtained.79–82 (3) Multichannel: by using paraffin oil as the inner liquid (divided into three parts based on three capillaries in the inner fluid vessels) and a Ti(OiPr)4/PVP/ethanol solution as the outer fluid, a three channel tubular fibers can be obtained (Fig. 2e).67
In addition to the above-mentioned structures, electrospinning affords the possibility to generate more materials that are richer and smarter in the composition as well as structure such as barbed nanowires66 (Fig. 2f), spring-like fibers77 (Fig. 2g), kebab nanofibers71 (Fig. 2h) and spider-web-like nanofibers78 (Fig. 2i).
Remarkably, even more unique structures with intriguing features can also be easily spun via electrospinning.83–85 (1) Janus: Williams and co-workers successfully synthesized high quality PVP/shellac Janus nanofibers by using a modified and structured spinneret.86 Based on a concurrent electrospraying/electrospinning process, Lee and co-workers demonstrated Janus-faced battery separators as a strategy to improve the rate of the charge/discharge reaction and cycling performance.87 The prepared Janus separators can suppress the unwanted metal dissolution behavior and show higher ionic conductivity (1.16 mS cm−1vs. 0.91 mS cm−1 for the PE separator), breaking the stereotype that the battery separator is inert as the first dual (ion/electron)-conductive/chemically active battery separator. Moreover, hierarchical nanostructures can also be fabricated via coupling electrospinning with other techniques like calcination,73 solvothermal processing,88etc. For instance, nanorod-on-nanofiber structures of V2O5/TiO2/Ta2O5 composites were obtained by adjusting the post-calcination temperature (Fig. 2j).73 In another reference, octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) catalysts were loaded on SiO2 nanofibers via a simultaneous electrospinning-spray method.89 The prepared OMS-2/SiO2 nanofibrous membrane was able to display much higher activity for formaldehyde decomposition than the OMS-2 powder. Obviously, by easily controlling parameters like the composition of polymer-based solution and coupling with other methods, electrospinning is expected to be one of the main synthetic strategies for preparing all kinds of complex nanomaterials that possess desirable properties including electrode materials for SCs. In turn, the resultant electrochemical behaviour of electrospun nanomaterials can provide useful guidance for optimizing the synthetic parameters. In recent years, all kinds of electrospun nanomaterials with tailored characteristics have been proposed for SC applications, which will be discussed in detail.
3. Electrospun nanomaterial electrodes for SCs
As mentioned, electrospun nanomaterials with appealing advantages could satisfy the basic requirements of nanomaterial electrodes for SCs. To date, enormously advanced electrospun nanomaterials as electrodes for SCs have been designed and exhibited excellent electrochemical activity and structural stability. Their physicochemical properties can be gradually enhanced via manipulation of their tunable morphologies, space arrangement and chemical constituents such as the thickness and diameter, texture, porosity, wettability, mechanical strength, alignment, stacking, folding, etc. More importantly, these structural and compositional adaptability in electrospun materials are highly desirable for developing outstanding electrode materials for SCs.
In this section, because the diversity of electrospun nanofibers can be greatly expanded through a combination of a facile top-down electrospinning technique with subsequently post-treatments such as high-temperature calcination, solvothermal, electrodeposition and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) for constructing more forms of nanomaterials, electrospun nanomaterials prepared via electrospinning and subsequent heat/chemical post-treatments are categorized into three main groups: CNFs, CNF-based fibers and carbon-free fibers represented by transition metal oxides. Firstly, the application of electrospun CNF electrodes in SCs will be widely discussed by summarizing strategies involving physical/chemical activation, modification of spinnable precursor solution and heteroatom doping for enhancing their performances. Next, CNF-based materials comprised of CNFs as the host/substrate and other electro-active materials such as metal oxides, metal nitrides, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), conducting polymers, etc. with a designed architecture and chemical composition for SC electrodes will be described. In the following, attention will be paid to pseudocapacitive transition metal oxides concerning the relationship between their fabrication and electrochemical performances.
3.1 Pore engineering and heteroatom doping of CNFs
Currently, a wide range of polymer fibers have been employed to electrospun CNFs, such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyimide (PI), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), PVP, phenolic resin, cellulose, pitch etc.. Among them, electrospun PAN fibers are the most popular precursors for the preparation of CNFs owing to their good spinnability and high carbon yield (>50%), as well as the superior mechanical properties of the resultant CNFs. Moreover, the linear structure of PAN fibers could be turned into a graphite-like aromatic structure via high-temperature carbonation.90 Thus, the electronic conductivity of CNFs will increase with the increment of the carbonization temperature since a more ordered graphitic structure can be obtained. However, the specific capacitance of pure electrospun CNFs is relatively low compared with graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which is attributed to its low surface area and inferior electronic conductivity.91 Novel strategies and design rules, therefore, have been explored and applied to boost their electrochemical performance.
Approaches such as activation treatment of as-spun fibers with gases and chemicals, using polymer blends instead of single-component polymers in spin dopes, adding metal salts and using templates in polymer-based solution, doping heteroatoms, etc. are efficient for maximizing the electrochemical performance of electrospun CNFs by optimizing several important factors (pore characteristics and distribution, conductivity, wettability, etc.). Among all the factors, pore characteristics and distribution influence the electrochemical performance most; to construct an effective and ideal pore structure, there are the following requirements: (i) similar pore size to the solvated ion sizes of the used electrolyte; both larger and smaller pores lead to a significant drop in capacitance.298 (ii) Appropriate pore size distribution; a hierarchically porous structure with an optimal pore ratio (meso–micro, macro, etc.) can maximum the positive effects of pores in electrospun nanofibers, especially when combined with good hydrophilicity and wettability of pores. Specifically, macropores act as reservoirs of electrolyte ions, and mesopores are the diffusion channels for electrolyte ions. Particularly, micropores of electrospun CNFs play the dominant roles in ion storage, thereby contributing more to a high specific surface area and capacitance in comparison to mesopores and macropores. In addition, influencing factors like the conductivity and wettability of electrospun CNFs can also be enhanced by heteroatom doping, defect engineering and functional group tailoring.
Various gases (steam, carbon dioxide, air, etc.) and chemical regents (sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, phosphoric acid nitric acid, etc.) are used to activate electrospun CNFs, through physical or chemical activation or both of them, which can not only improve the pore structure of CNFs, but also increase their surface functional groups. For instance, porous CNFs with different pore sizes were prepared by Kim et al.92via the activation of PAN-based fibers with different activation media (N2, H2O, or CO2) at 800 or 900 °C. It was found that H2O activation reduced the electrospun PAN fiber diameter most, followed by CO2 and N2 activation. Generally, CO2-activated PCNFs performed best in terms of capacitance. It was also found that CNF electrodes having pore sizes similar to solvated ion diameters exhibited higher normalized capacitance. Heo et al.93 utilized a sequential process of electrospinning, carbonization, and KOH activation at various temperatures under a N2 atmosphere to prepare PAN-based CNFs (Fig. 3a). The pristine CNFs suffered from a poor specific surface area of 15 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 0.021 cm3 g−1, exhibiting a low specific capacitance of 5.22 F g−1. Fortunately, when the activation temperature increased from 600 to 1000 °C, the specific surface area of the activated CNFs increased from 632 to 1886 m2 g−1 and the pore volume increased from 0.375 to 1.196 cm3 g−1; the CNFs activated at 1000 °C exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 103.01 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte and a high capacitance retention of 94% after 3000 cycles at 3 A g−1.

Except for PAN-based CNFs, CNFs derived from other polymers such as PI and PBI have also been tested as electrodes in SCs.94,95 Electrospun polymer blends such as PAN/PMMA,96 PI/PVP,97 PAN/PVP,98 and phenolic resin/PVA99 could realize better control of the pore structure and properties of CNFs, compared with single component polymer derived CNFs, and blended porous CNFs show a higher specific surface area and specific capacitance. In a polymer blends system, CNFs can be customized by controlling the ratio of the different components in the polymer blends and the molecular weight of sacrificial polymers, by using different combinations, etc. In Park's work, lignin/PAN blends at a range of mass ratios in DMF were electrospun into fibers, followed by heat treatments to produce highly porous and turbostratic CNFs.100 Both of the specific surface area and total pore volume increased substantially with increasing the content of lignin, and the CNFs prepared with 75 wt% lignin in spinning solution showed the largest specific surface area of 1176.0 m2 g−1 (nearly 15 times higher than that of pure PAN derived CNFs) and the largest pore volume of 0.394 cm3 g−1 due to the micro- and meso-pores formed by the self-activation of lignin. Moreover, a flexible SC based on the porous CNFs with 50 wt% lignin demonstrated a high capacitance of 129.23 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of 95% over 10000 cycles in a lignin hydrogel electrolyte. In another study, mesoporous CNFs were obtained via the stabilization and carbonization of electrospun PAN-based fibers containing a certain amount of block copolymer (0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 g) of PAA-b-PAN-b-PAA.101 It was found that the addition of the block copolymer into PAN polymer solution resulted in an effective porous structure of the fiber interior. The resultant CNFs exhibited a BET surface area between 7.9 and 304 m2 g−1 and an average pore diameter in the range of 7.5–44.8 nm. Interestingly, the maximum BET surface area of 304 m2 g−1 and total pore volume of 0.212 cm3 g−1 were obtained at a block copolymer amount of 0.8 g in the spinning solution, whereas the maximum specific capacitance of 256.3 F g−1 was measured on the prepared CNFs using 0.6 g of block copolymer with a current density of 0.5 A g−1, indicating that a part of the pores in the prepared CNFs using 0.8 g of block copolymer might be ineffective for the adsorption of electrolyte ions. PAN and PMMA with different mass ratios (10:0, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4 and 5:5) in DMF were used as electrospinning solution to prepare CNFs. The maximum BET surface area of 683.5 m2 g−1 was obtained at a PAN/PMMA ratio of 7:3.102 In addition, ultra-thin CNFs with 28 ± 11 nm diameters were produced via immiscible PAN/PMMA centrifuged electrospinning coupled with subsequent stabilization at 280 °C in air and carbonization at 800 °C in Ar, exhibiting a specific capacitance of 243 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent rate capability with a capacitance retention of 77.1% at 100 A g−1.103 Different activation strategies mentioned above have also been applied to electrospun polymer blends toward further enhancement of the prepared CNFs in terms of their pore characteristics. In Chen's work, KOH-activated hollow porous CNFs were produced through coaxial electrospinning, carbonization and KOH-activation.104 As shown in Fig. 3b and c, by altering the concentration of KOH aqueous solution (1 to 4 M) and activation temperatures (800 or 1000 °C), the prepared PAN/PMMA derived CNFs under optimized conditions (4 M-1000 °C) showed an increased BET surface area and total pore volume that mainly come from the generation of new micro- and meso-pores. The specific surface area of the optimized CNFs drastically increased by 34 times to 1753.9 m2 g−1 compared to pristine porous CNFs (52.3 m2 g−1). Owing to the wide pore size distribution from both mesopores and micropores generated during the KOH activation, the specific capacitance of the hollow porous CNFs reached 191.3 F g−1, much higher than that of the pristine porous CNFs (36.4 F g−1) (Fig. 3d and e).
Porous CNFs with a suitable pore size and porosity were also produced by electrospinning a polymer-based precursor solution with different mass ratios of PAN/PVP followed by phase separation, carbonization and CO2 activation treatments.105 The CNFs derived from PAN/PVP spin dopes with a mass ratio of 10:5 displayed the highest specific surface area of 1256.2 m2 g−1. Moreover, a symmetrical device based on the porous CNFs displayed a specific capacitance of 248.3 F g−1, low internal resistance (0.82 Ω) and wide electrochemical window (3.5 V).
Except for activation and blend polymer electrospinning strategies, metal salts, as a multifunctional additive in the fabrication of electrospun CNFs, have been widely used in recent years.106 By adding salts into polymer-based solution, the graphitization degree of the CNF network can be effectively improved due to the catalysis of metal in the carbonization process.65 Besides, the thermal decomposition of metal salts will generally produce gases and lead to a more porous structure, thus increasing the specific surface area of CNFs.107 Kalra et al.108 demonstrated that the presence of NaCl in polymer-based solution could realize a higher oxygen content on the surface of CNFs, particularly in the form of carboxyl groups. Recently, Schlee et al.109 demonstrated that the addition of NaNO3 into lignin-based polymer solution could considerably enhance the energy density of the resultant CNF mats that are prepared via electrospinning and carbonization conducted in forming gas. The pore size distribution of the pristine CNF mats showed considerable voids between the fibers, revealing the need for the densification to obtain (space-)efficient CNF mats, and adding oxidative NaNO3 could make the resulting fibers slimmer and develop microporosity and oxygenated groups. Therefore, the resultant free-standing CNF network exhibited an enhanced gravimetric capacitance of 192 F g−1 and an ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 2245 μW h cm−3.
By introducing a mesoporous silica template into the PAN/DMF spinnable solution and etching out the silica in the end, bubbled CNFs with a large accessible surface area (593 m2 g−1) and well-developed pore structures were fabricated, exhibiting a high specific capacitance of 287 F g−1 at 0.4 A g−1.110 In Xiao' work, porous hollow CNFs with a high BET surface area of 648 m2 g−1 were prepared with coaxial electrospinning paraffin oil as the core and PAN/TEOS as the shell, followed by calcination at 1000 °C to pyrolyze paraffin oil and HF treatment to remove the SiO2 derived from TEOS (Fig. 4a and b).111 A high specific capacitance of 261 at 1 A g−1 was obtained by the resultant CNFs. Furthermore, a soft-pack SC based on the CNFs achieved a promising energy density of 48.6 ± 3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1.35 kW kg−1 (Fig. 4c and d). By using a Mg(OH)2/PAN precursor solution, through an in situ MgO template method, N-doped CNFs with rich mesopores were prepared.112 The resultant CNFs exhibited a BET surface area of 926.40 m2 g−1, which was 4.5 times higher than that of the conventional CNFs (Fig. 4e and f). When used as electrodes for SCs, the optimized CNFs showed a high specific capacitance of 327.3 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a remarkable cycling stability with 93% retention after 10000 cycles at 20 A g−1 owing to the mesopores that served as the diffusion channels for fast electrolyte ion diffusion. Generally, pure PAN-derived CNFs are very hard to graphitize.113 Electrospun PAN/FeCl3 fibers were heated at 800 °C for 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere, soaked in 0.3 M HCl and further activated in KOH, to form porous CNFs with a graphitic carbon skeleton, exhibiting a high-rate capacitance of 165 F g−1 at 300 A g−1 in an alkaline electrolyte.114 Micro- and meso-porous CNFs with a high graphitization degree (MCNF) were produced with a coaxial electrospinning inner PAN precursor and iron acetylacetonate/PAN precursors in the shell region, followed by carbonization and corrosion treatment in HCl solution for the removal of Fe3C.115 The MCNF showed an improved BET surface area of 563 m2 g−1 and an average pore diameter of 3.28 nm (Fig. 4g). Mesopores were formed by etching Fe3C, and HCl corroded the Fe3C species only. As a result, the mesopore volume of MCNF was 0.35 cm3 g−1, which was more than 10 times higher than that of pristine CNFs. Fig. 4h shows the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of pristine CNFs and MCNF at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 with two roughly symmetric rectangular shapes, indicating that the surface of MCNF exhibited double layer capacitance with good reversibility. Weak redox peaks were observed and should be attributed to the pseudocapacitance of nitrogen and oxygen functional groups on the surface of the MCNF. With a porous and cross-linked structure, the MCNF showed a maximum specific capacitance of 272 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, much higher than that of pristine CNFs (216 F g−1).

Typically, heteroatom doping is another forceful strategy to improve the properties like the electronic conductivity and surface wettability of electrospun CNFs through modification of the band gap, creation of oxygen vacancies and boosting the carrier density.116 Moreover, multi-heteroatom doping in electrospun CNFs could generate a synergistic effect of different dopants, leading to an enhanced performance.117 The commonly used doped atoms are nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorous (P), boron (B), fluorine (F), etc., among which the CNF electrode doped with N atoms has been widely studied. Basically, there are two methods for producing N-doped CNFs: in situ method (direct pyrolysis of a nitrogen-containing precursor) and post-thermal treatment method (NH3, g-C3N4, etc.).118,119 For instance, Lou et al.120 utilized a simple electrospinning method to prepare hierarchical porous N-doped CNFs. Ultrafine zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) nanoparticles were embedded into PAN-derived nanofibers and transformed into interconnected N-doped carbon hollow nanoparticles during the subsequent carbonization treatment. As shown in Fig. 5a–c, such a uniform distribution of N element and the unique 1D fiber-like structure guarantee the high electrochemical activity and favorable kinetics of the resultant CNFs, giving rise to a high specific capacitance of 307.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and fascinating cycling stability of 98.2% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. Similarly, by mixing hexaazatriphenylene-hexacarbonitrile (HAT-CN) with PVP as the precursors, through electrospinning and thermal condensation, a series of microporous CNFs with different N contents were prepared (Fig. 5d).121 In detail, when the temperature of thermal condensation increased from 700 to 1000 °C, the N content in the resultant N-rich CNFs decreased from 15 to 5 wt%, along with the specific surface area increased from 308 to 644 m2 g−1. The high N-doping level introduced by the HAT-CN precursor could provide abundant low-energy sites for sodium storage, while the porous carbon framework of CNFs could facilitate the ion transport. As a result, the sample prepared at 850 °C with a uniform distribution of N element within the entire porous structure exhibited a superior capacity of 361 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 as the anode in a sodium ion capacitor device. Moreover, in view of the relatively sluggish activity of the quaternary N dopant in CNFs, Xue's team prepared porous CNFs with rich pyrrolic and pyridinic N dopants by subtly using poly(acrylonitrile-co-acrylic acid) copolymer and terephthalic acid as electrospinning precursors (Fig. 5e).122 The as-prepared sample revealed exceptional performance with a high specific capacitance of 327 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 and an energy density of 4.5 W h kg−1 at an outstanding power density of 20.9 kW kg−1 (for symmetric SCs). The superior electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the terephthalic acid sublimation induced mesoporous structure and increased pyrrolic N content long with micropores derived from acrylic acid degradation. In addition, CNFs with an 8.96 at% N content were prepared by applying a post-thermal treatment of g-C3N4 powder to electrospun PVP nanofibers, which exhibited an enhanced specific capacitance of 265 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 (ten times higher than that of pure CNFs).123 In another reference, N-doped CNFs were fabricated by electrospinning a Zn(Ac)2·2H2O/PAN precursor solution, followed by peroxidization (ZnO/p-PAN), ion exchange reaction (ZnO/p-PAN@ZIF-8), and H2/Ar annealing.124 ZnO nanoparticles that formed after peroxidization not only created multiscale pores but also provided zinc sources for in situ growth of ZIF-8 nanoparticle layers. Furthermore, ZIF-8-derived carbon layers welded the isolated N-doped CNFs, forming hierarchically porous N-doped welded CNFs (HPNWC) with a spider-web structure (Fig. 5f and g). The multi-stage pore structure facilitated the permeation of electrolytes, guaranteeing superior ion diffusion. Besides, interconnected carbon networks served as a “superhighway” for electrons and reduced the contact resistance of CNFs. N-doping further improved the overall electronic conductivity and induced super-hydrophilic behaviour. Benefiting from the above features, the HPNWC exhibited a rate capability of 75.5% capacitance retention from 0.5 to 35 A g−1 and ultra-stable cycling stability (98.8% capacitance retention after 100000 cycles at 10 A g−1). Except for single heteroatom doping, dual- or tri-heteroatom doping has been utilized in SCs as well. Electrospun CNFs doped with N and S (NSCNFs) were derived from ZIF-67/thiourea/PAN precursor solution and tested as an electrode for SCs with a higher specific capacitance of 396 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 than undoped CNFs (192 F g−1).125 Furthermore, the flexible SC device assembled with NSCNFS electrodes achieved a high specific capacitance of 103 F g−1 and a high energy density of 14.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 250 W kg−1.

In addition, more strategies to boost the performance of electrospun CNF electrodes in SCs are summarized (Table 1). For instance, plasma-modified CNFs were able to deliver 377 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 due to increased fiber wettability.126 Without adding synthetic polymers like PAN, optimized by CO2 activation, lignin derived CNFs with a high BET surface area of 648 m2 g−1 can also be prepared, which exhibited good rate capabilities (155 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 113 F g−1 at 250 A g−1).127 Therefore, the architecture, conductivity and surface chemistry of CNFs can be further improved to deliver a better electrochemical performance.

3.2 CNF-based composites for SCs
Currently, metal or metal compounds have been widely investigated as electrode materials for SCs owing to their high theoretical specific capacity. Nevertheless, the inferior electronic conductivity, poor ion-diffusion and instability (metal) of such materials still hinder their practical applications. Massive research studies have indicated that coupling with a high electronic conductivity carbon matrix is a fascinating method to address the above problems. Electrospun 1D CNFs possess high mechanical strength, excellent electronic conductivity, and a high surface area, making them a promising substrate/host for metal or metal compounds. Furthermore, CNFs within CNF-based composites offer a number of advantages: (i) the ability to effectively inhibit the agglomeration of active materials, (ii) substantial enhancement of the electrochemically active surface area, (iii) the ability to maintain the integrity of the composite electrode, (iv) more effective electrolyte permeation and ion/electron transport and (v) an enlarged voltage window. As show in Table 2, the metal compounds showed enhanced cycling performance and rate capability when hybridized with highly compatible CNFs as electrode materials in SCs. Herein, based on diverse extensively studied active materials (i.e. metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal nitrides, metal phosphides, metal carbides, other nanocarbons, metal hydroxides, MOFs, and conducting polymers), different types of CNF-based composites are divided and discussed.
Table 2 Electrochemical performance comparison of electrospun CNF-based composite nanofibers with metals, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal nitrides, metal phosphides, metal carbides, other nanocarbons, metal hydroxides, metal–organic frameworks, and conducting polymersa

3.2.1 Metal composites. 
Introducing different metals as redox centers into electrospun CNFs as electrode materials has been proven as an effective strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of SCs.
Nickel-embedded CNFs with a Ni content of 22.4 wt% were prepared by electrospinning a nickel acetate/PAN precursor solution, followed by stabilization in air at 280 °C and carbonization in N2 at 1000 °C, exhibiting an enhanced specific capacitance of 164 F g−1, which was three times higher than that of pristine CNFs.128 Similarly, a higher specific capacitance of 615 F g−1 was reported by Lu et al.129 for electrospun CNFs/Ni nanofibers with NiO impurities obtained by electrospinning a nickel acetate/PAN precursor solution, followed by stabilization in air at 260 °C and carbonization in N2 at 700 °C. In another study, CNFs/Ni nanofibers were fabricated by applying a solvothermal reaction to preoxidized electrospun PAN fibers to form Ni-MOF nanosheet decorated electrospun nanofibers, followed by a heat treatment in Ar at different temperatures (Fig. 6a).130 The CV curves showed that the samples carbonized at 500 °C (CNFs/Ni-500) exhibited the largest encircled areas among the four CNFs/Ni samples obtained at different temperatures, demonstrating superior capacitance compared with the other three electrodes (Fig. 6b). Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves revealed that a high specific capacitance of 300 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 was obtained for the sample of CNFs/Ni-500 composite nanofibers (Fig. 6c). More importantly, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device assembled using the Ni-MOF based hybrid fibers as the anode and the CNFs/Ni-500 composite as the cathode revealed a maximum energy density of 51.4 W h kg−1 with a power density of 1500.1 W kg−1 (Fig. 6d and e).

Since some oxide-free metals on the surface of the carbon matrix can be oxidized during the electrochemical analysis, designing an architecture with a controlled metal distribution inside the CNFs under the preferred electrolyte medium to mitigate metallic dissolution and phase changes is significant. Very recently, a 3D hierarchical carbonaceous network with in situ generated metallic cobalt was fabricated through electrospinning, gas foaming and carbonization, exhibiting a high specific capacitance of 762 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 2 M KOH along with robust stability of 94.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles.131 Furthermore, the ASC device having the CNFs/Co composites as the positive electrode and nitrogen-doped graphene hydrogels as the negative electrode also exhibited excellent energy density and power density (24.6 W h Kg−1 at 797 W kg−1). In addition to Ni and Co, a specific capacitance of 183 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 was reported by electrospinning a copper acetate/PAN precursor solution and subsequent carbonization to form CNFs/Cu composites, and the average crystallite size of copper nanoparticles was found to be approximately 30 nm.132 At the same current density, a much higher specific capacitance (333.5 F g−1) was obtained by Lavanya et al.133 by electrospinning copper nitrate trihydrate in PAN/PVP solution, followed by carbonization, to form porous CNFs/Cu composites. Very recently, Zhang et al.134 also prepared electrospun CNFs/Cu composites with a high specific capacitance of 608 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 by electrospinning a cupric acetate/PAN precursor solution and carbonization in N2 at 800 °C. Therefore, the introduction of Cu nanoparticles with high conductivity into the composites could facilitate fast electron transfer inside the active materials, thus improving the overall electronic conductivity and performance. Liu et al.135 utilized different carbonization temperatures (500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C) to produce tin-embedded CNFs with different valence states including CNFs/SnO2, CNFs/SnO/Sn, and CNFs/Sn, respectively. The CNFs/Sn fibers showed a superior capacitance of 761.39 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, which was much higher than those of CNFs/SnO/Sn composites (712.29 F g−1) and CNFs/SnO2 composites (589.78 F g−1). Recently, Xu and co-workers136 utilized an electrospinning and carbothermal shock method to prepare CNFs/FeNiCoMnMg nanocomposites; with the synergistic effect between quinary alloy nanoparticles and aligned electrospun CNFs, the prepared composites displayed a high capacitance of 203 F g−1 and a specific energy density of 21.7 W h kg−1.
Except for the metals mentioned above, noble metals like Pt with superb intrinsic catalytic activity and conductivity have also been incorporated into CNFs for use as SC electrode materials. Zhang et al.137 fabricated hierarchical CNFs with homogeneously dispersed Pt nanoparticles via electrospinning and carbonization. The specific capacitance of CNFs/Pt drastically increased from 4.6 to 226.1 F g−1 when the Pt loading was increased from 0 to 0.14 g cm−2, achieving a nearly 50-fold increase. By electrospinning AgNO3 in polymerized sucrose/PVA solution, followed by stabilization and carbonization processes, Ag nanoparticles with a size of around 11 nm were embedded in the CNFs to form CNFs/Ag composites (0.1 wt% Ag doping), showing a ten-fold increase in electrical conductivity as well as two-fold enhancement in capacitance over the pristine CNFs; an increase in capacitance by 65% during 5000 continuous cycling was also observed.138 In another study, PAN-derived CNFs were electroplated with silver to form a core–shell structure with an outer diameter of approximately 100 nm and an inner diameter of nearly 190 nm.139 Owing to the good electrical conductivity of the silver shell and interconnected junctions in the core–shell structure, the ASC device assembled with CNFs/Ag composites and CNFs exhibited enhanced areal capacitance (30.6 mF cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2), superior rate capability (87% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles from 0.1 to 0.5 mA cm−2), admirable long-term stability (∼100% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles), and high energy density (61 mW h m−2 at 6 W m−2). Lee et al.140 prepared a ruthenium acetylacetonate/PAN-derived carbon web with small Ru particles (2 to 15 nm) distributed randomly within the web. When the Ru loading of the CNFs/Ru composites increased from 0 to 7.31 wt%, the specific capacitance increased from 140 to 391 F g−1. Additionally, CNFs decorated with Ru–Ag nanophases were developed as well, and the composites exhibited high capacitance (350.0 F g−1 at 100 mV s−1) and superb capacity retention (98.6%).141 The XRD and XPS results indicated that the Ru phase is composed of two parts (inner metallic Ru and shell Ru oxide); the oxidation of Ru here is believed to have a direct effect on the capacitive performance, which is common during the oxidation scan.


3.2.2 Metal oxide composites. 
With rich redox chemistry and unique properties, nanostructured metal oxides can endow EDLCs with high pseudocapacitance and have been proven to be very promising candidates for energy conversion and storage devices.142 Based on the electrospinning technique, a wide variety of nanostructures composed of metal oxides and electrospun CNFs have been prepared and used as electrode materials for SCs, revealing their great potential for practical applications. Incorporating transition metal oxides into highly conductive CNFs is a good strategy for efficient electron and ion transport.
Among various transition metal oxides, manganese oxides (MnxOy) are regarded as promising electrode materials for SCs in view of their abundance, environmental benignity, and most importantly, high theoretical specific capacitance. Typically, the preparation of electrospun CNF-based hybrid electrodes involves a carbonization process. Zhi et al.143 demonstrated the fabrication of two kinds of manganese oxide-loaded CNFs: the slow heated one (CNFs/MnOx-slow) and the fast heated one (CNFs/MnOx-fast) formed during the heating process in argon at 900 °C, and tested them as SC electrodes. Owing to the excellent crystallinity of MnOx nanoparticles and the formation of graphitic carbon layers on the surface of CNFs/MnOx-slow, CNFs/MnOx-slow showed lower AC impedance, better rate capability, longer cycle life and higher capacitance. Engineering a unique structure for pseudocapacitive manganese oxide on the outermost surface of CNFs is effective to ensure the full usage of active sites. CNFs composited with manganese oxide with a core–shell structure were prepared by coaxial electrospinning a PAN/DMF solution and a shell solution consisting of PAN, manganese nitrate and DMF, followed by heat treatment and CO2 activation.144 The obtained CNFs/MnOx composites with a large specific area (701 m2 g−1) showed a specific capacitance of 213.7 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, which was higher than that of the pure CNFs of 177.8 F g−1. By adding manganese acetylacetonate as the manganese source to the PAN/DMF solution, CNFs/MnO nanofibers were prepared via electrospinning and subsequent carbonization treatment.145 It was found that the Mn salts can improve the graphitic degree of the heat-treated CNFs. Although MnO is less conductive, CNFs/MnO could maintain a relatively good conductivity. The ASC device based on CNFs/MnO nanofibers displayed an improved capacitance of 200 F g−1 at 2.5 mV s−1 compared with that of the pure CNF based SC of 90 F g−1.
In an electrospinning process, dissolving reinforcement agents in the polymer-based solution before spinning can achieve boosted performance of fibers, yet coaxial CNFs/MnOx can also be prepared via a post-synthesis process after electrospinning, such as electrodeposition,146 dip-coating and solvothermal treatments. For instance, during a modified dip-coating process, based on in situ redox reactions between the porous, interconnected CNF scaffold and permanganate ions, a uniform, ultrathin MnO2 coating with a high areal mass loading (0.33 mg cm−2) was obtained.147 The CNF core not only provided considerable surface areas for MnO2 coating but also offered reliable electrical conductivity to ensure the full utilization of MnO2 coatings. Both the high surface area and enhanced conductivity enabled the hierarchical CNFs/MnOx electrode to show a high specific capacitance of 557 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 0.1 M Na2SO4. CNFs/MnO2 nanocomposites can also be prepared by immersing the electrospun CNFs in low concentration KMnO4 solution for a long time to form a unique honeycomb porous structure.148 The obtained CNFs/MnO2 electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 292 F g−1 at a current density of 2.5 A g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4. Similarly, multichannel CNFs derived from electrospun PAN/PMMA nanofibers that are entirely covered with uniform hair-like MnO2 were reported.149 Such a structure not only increased the surface area but also enhanced the overall electrochemical performance, and thus a high specific capacitance of 855 F g−1 with outstanding cycle stability (87.3% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles) was obtained. By changing the electrodeposition current, MnO2 with different thicknesses could be electrodeposited on electrospun PAN-derived CNFs to serve as a separator and electrode.150 Without using a traditional membrane separator, the prepared CNFs/MnO2 gave a capacitance of 141 F g−1 and a specific energy density of 12.5 W h kg−1. Except for optimizing the thickness of MnO2, pre-intercalation can also produce MnO2 with improved pseudocapacitance through reduced crystallinity and a shortened ion diffusion length. In a recent study, sodium-pre-intercalated δ-MnO2 was in situ grown on electrospun CNFs via immersion of CNFs in Na2SO4/KMnO4 solution at 65 °C.151 It was found that the Na+ intercalation could significantly reduce the crystallinity of δ-MnO2 and improve the pseudocapacitance utilization of MnO2; with the excellent electric conductivity from the CNF network, the prepared CNFs/NaxMnO2 nanocomposites revealed a high specific capacitance of 321 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a mixed electrolyte (1 M Na2SO4/4 mM NaHCO3) and excellent rate capability (∼241 F g−1 at 32 A g−1). Similarly, CNFs/KxMnO2 nanocomposites have also been reported and showed a high specific capacitance of 279 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1 M K2SO4 with ∼82.3% capacitance retention from 1 to 32 A g−1.152
Recently, a high energy density (97.6 W h kg−1) along with impressive cycling steadiness (73% retention after 5000 cycles at 1 A g−1) was reported by Yang et al.153 for a lithium-ion capacitor fabricated by using PAN/hydrothermal-made V3O7·H2O nanowire derived CNFs/V2O3 hybrids as the anode and commercial activated carbon (AC) as the cathode. Additionally, the prepared CNFs/V2O3 nanocomposites with internal void spaces displayed a high capacity of 569.1 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 as well as unexpected rate capability (238.5 mA hg−1 at 10.0 A g−1) in half-cell tests. By electrospinning a PAN/VO(acac)2 precursor solution, followed by calcination, V–O–C nanocomposites with a specific surface area of 587.9 m2 g−1 were obtained.154 An atomic level dispersion of vanadium within the composite nanofibers enabled the resultant V–O–C nanocomposites to deliver a specific capacitance of 463 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with good electronic conductivity and electrolyte penetration. Moreover, the electrochemical properties of V5+ are superior to those of V3+ and V4+ when vanadium oxide-embedded carbon fibers are applied in a supercapacitor. Bai et al.155 produced CNFs/V2O3, CNFs/VO2–V2O5 and CNFs/V2O5via electrospinning a PAN/VO(acac)2 precursor solution, followed by different calcination processes. The results showed that the electrochemical performance of CNFs/V2O5 is better than that of CNFs/V2O3 and CNFs/VO2–V2O5 when they were applied to SCs. In Tang's work, CNFs/VO/VOx web-like nanocomposites were obtained by electrospinning a polymer-based solution containing PAN, PVP, hybrid vanadium precursors (VO2, V2O5, and VO(acac)2) and DMF, followed by carbonization treatment.156 The formation of quasi-metallic VO (∼102 Ω−1 cm−1) in the CNF enhanced the rate of electron transfer in the web-like electrode. Besides, the well-developed pore structure and rich vanadium redox couples also promoted the rapid ion transfer rate. As a consequence, the SC equipped with symmetric CNFs/VO/VOx electrodes exhibited a specific capacitance of 325.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 92% retention at 4 A g−1 after 5000 cycles.
In addition to electrospun precursor nanofiber derived CNFs/vanadium oxide nanocomposites, a post-synthesis process for introducing vanadium oxide into CNFs after electrospinning has also been reported. Through facile in situ hydrothermal deposition of a V2O5 layer with a thickness of 8–17 nm on PAN-derived CNFs, flexible CNFs/V2O5 nanocomposites with different deposition periods (5 day and 7 day) were reported.157 The samples with a 7 day period V2O5-deposition displayed much higher specific capacitance (227 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) than the samples with 5 day period V2O5-deposition (157 F g−1) due to a better formed nanostructure with a better ion diffusion rate. In another study, much higher specific capacitance (1308 F g−1) was obtained by applying an electrodeposition process of V2O5 nanofilms with a thicknesses of 3 nm on an electrospun PAN-derived carbon nanofiber mat, to form CNFs/V2O5 nanocomposites.158 The porous carbon nanofiber mat served as a self-standing electrical-conducting substrate to maintain the carrier-transport layer and to give an electrolyte access to all of the V2O5; it also acted as a substrate to accommodate a uniform ultrathin V2O5 film. Therefore, it is effective to realize a maximum pseudocapacitance while minimizing the resistance of the V2O5 nanofilms by further narrowing their thickness down.
Electrospun CNFs/hollow Co3O4 composites with a Co3O4 nanoparticle size ranging from 20 to 40 nm were synthesized by applying subsequent carbonization and oxidation processes to as-electrospun Co(acac)2/PAN nanofibers.159 The obtained Co3O4 hollow nanoparticle embedded CNFs displayed a high specific capacitance of 556 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 along with surprising rate capability. In addition, PAN/CoAc derived CNFs/Co3O4 nanocomposites that can deliver a high specific capacitance of 586 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a 6 M KOH electrolyte were reported as well.160 It was found that a graphitization process of the Co3O4 nanoparticles can both encapsulate Co3O4 within the CNFs and gain better electrical conductivity, leading to enhanced electrochemical performance. Apart from the polymer-derived composites mentioned above, post-synthesis like self-assembly is another approach to introduce metal oxides into electrospun CNFs. For instance, by immersing PAN-derived films in dopamine solution followed by Co3O4 solution and post-annealing, Co3O4 NPs with a diameter of 10–20 nm were uniformly dispersed on the CNFs to form CNFs/Co3O4 composites.161 The resultant CNFs/Co3O4 composites exhibited a high capacitance of 418 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 2 M KOH. Lee et al.162 used a dip-coating and calcination method after electrospinning to fabricate highly porous CNFs/Co3O4 composite nanofibers with an enhancement of crystallinity owing to the catalytic graphitization induced by the Co3O4 nanoparticles. With a specific surface area of 964 m2 g−1, the CNFs/Co3O4 composites achieved a high specific capacitance of 137 F g−1 along with outstanding cycling steadiness (91% retention after 5000 cycles) when used as a free-standing electrode in SCs.
Iron oxides are also potential candidates as an electrode for SCs due to their high theoretical redox capacitance (2299 F g −1). By using Fe(acac)3 as an iron oxide precursor added to poly(styrene-co-acrylonitrile)/lignin-based solution, iron oxide particle-decorated, hollow CNFs were fabricated via electrospinning and subsequent carbonization.163 The XPS analysis indicated that the iron oxide was a mixture of hematite and magnetite plus metallic iron metal. The porous and hollow CNFs/iron oxide nanocomposites exhibited a specific capacitance of 121.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a cycling steadiness with a 90% retention rate after 1000 cycles in 1 M Na2SO3. In addition, iron oxides experience severe structural instability, which makes it challenging to develop freestanding and binder-free iron oxide based electrodes. By electrospinning a PAN/Fe(acac)3 precursor solution and subsequent carbonization, iron/iron carbide/CNFs can be obtained, and the hybrid fibers were further in situ converted into more stable CNFs/FeOx nanocomposites during thirty-five electrochemical cycles in 6 M KOH (Fig. 7a).164 The composites can directly serve as a freestanding and binder-free electrode, exhibiting a high capacitance of 460 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 along with impressive cycling stability (∼12% capacitance loss over 5000 cycles). Through a different scheme, highly dispersed Fe3O4 nanosheets were successfully grown on the electrospun CNFs via a post-hydrothermal process.165 A higher specific capacitance was achieved for the resultant CNFs/Fe3O4 nanocomposites (135 F g−1) in comparison to the pure CNFs (83 F g−1).

In Li's work, nitrogen-enriched porous CNFs/NO composites as a free-standing film electrode were fabricated via electrospinning a solution containing nickel acetylacetonate, PAN, and dicyandiamide with various loadings (as a nitrogen-rich sacrificial precursor), followed by heat treatment.166 As shown in Fig. 7b and c, NiO nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 30 to 50 nm were well embedded into the porous network of CNFs without aggregation. In addition, the incorporation of N-species into the carbon matrix enhanced the overall electronic conductivity and wettability, giving rise to accelerated transfer of electrons and charge. Moreover, with the porous surface structure and synergistic effect between CNFs and NiO, the optimized CNFs/NiO film electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 850 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with excellent rate capability (88.0% retention at 10 A g−1), and superb cycling stability (96.7% retention after 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1).
Except for the metal oxides mentioned above, some other metal oxides such as ZnO, Nb2O5, SnO2, and Bi2O3 have also been introduced into CNFs to fabricate high-performance electrodes for SCs. In Lee' work, ZnO-decorated CNFs were prepared via carbonization of electrospun ZIF-8/PVA nanofibers and possessed a plum-branch-like morphology with well-dispersed ZnO quantum dots over the CNFs (Fig. 7e).167 CNFs/ZnO displayed significantly enhanced conductivity (18.8 S cm−1) via interconnecting ZIF-8-derived particles with 1D CNFs. In addition, owing to the faradaic reaction derived from ZnO and the hierarchical pore structure, the prepared CNFs/ZnO nanohybrid electrode showed a larger CV loop area than pure CNFs, and an enhanced capacitance of 346 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with an increased rate capability (79% capacitance retention at 8 A g−1) was obtained. Furthermore, the CNFs/ZnO composites exhibited an excellent long cycle life with a capacitance retention of 85% after 5000 cycles.
Electrospun CNFs/Nb2O5 composite nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning a solution containing the precursors of Nb(C2O4H)5, PAN and TEOS, followed by carbonization and SiO2-etching.168Fig. 7f and g show the structural features of the prepared CNFs/Nb2O5 nanocomposites, which reveal a continuous mesoporous network architecture. Compared with solid CNFs/Nb2O5 composites without using TEOS in spinnable solution and bulk C/Nb2O5 prepared via directly annealing the Nb(C2O4H)5, the mesoporous CNFs/Nb2O5 composites revealed much superior electrochemical reactivity. In detail, the mesoporous Nb2O5/CNF showed outstanding cyclability (94% retention after 10000 cycles at 100C, 1C = 200 mA g−1), and superior rate capability with specific capacities of 287 mA h g−1 at 0.5C and 172 mA h g−1 at 150C, which was much higher than that of pure CNFs (159.1 mA h g−1 at 0.5C and 64.9 mA h g−1 at 100C). In addition, a hybrid Na-ion capacitor was fabricated by employing mesoporous CNFs/Nb2O5 as the anode and CNFs/graphene as the cathode. This device showed both large energy densities (124 W h kg−1, 11.2 mW h cm−3) and impressive power densities (60 kW kg−1, 5.4 W h cm−3), indicating that both the introducing of Nb2O5 and the unique continuous mesoporous network architecture played a crucial role in the enhancement of the electrochemical properties.
Recently, electrospun CNFs were produced by electrospinning combined with carbonization and etching treatments, and the activated porous CNFs were further immersed in SnCl2 aqueous solution with different concentrations and annealed at 360 °C in air to form CNFs/SnO2 nanocomposites.169 The optimized CNFs/SnO2 electrode with a BET surface area of 595.31 m2 g−1 and abundant micropores possessed a specific capacitance of 225.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and enhanced rate performance (73.7% retention at 20 A g−1), which was much higher than that of pristine CNFs (66 F g−1, 14.8%). A symmetric device based on the porous CNFs/SnO2 electrodes also delivered a satisfactory energy density of 10.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 325 W kg−1.
The integration of Bi2O3 nanosheets and porous CNFs for SCs was reported by Lin's group.170 Bi2O3 nanosheets were nicely anchored on the surface of PAN-derived CNFs to form an open 3D network through a post-solvothermal treatment (Fig. 7d). With a band gap of 2.8 eV, Bi2O3 possesses poor intrinsic electronic conductivity, yet the hierarchical CNFs/Bi2O3 composites demonstrated a drastically increased areal capacitance of 530 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 compared with that of pristine CNFs without Bi2O3 decoration (45 mF cm−2) as well as excellent cycling stability. The enhancement indicated that the conductive network (900 S m−1) of CNFs could enhance the external electronic conductivity of Bi2O3. In addition, the ASC device by using the CNFs/Bi2O3 composites as the negative electrode and carbon cloth/NiCo2O4 as the positive electrode in a 1 M KOH electrolyte also achieved a high energy density of 25.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 786.2 W kg−1.
Similarly, the introduction of binary metal oxides with multiple redox active sites and good structural stability into CNFs can influence their architecture and increase their electronic conductivity as well. Tian et al.171 prepared different nanostructures of Ni–Mn oxide (Ni–Mn–O) grown on electrospun CNFs. A high capacitance of 386 F g−1 with excellent rate properties (88.6% retention at 20 times the initial current density) was achieved for the electrospun CNFs coated with Ni–Mn–O nanosheets. Furthermore, a solid-state symmetry cell based on the CNFs/Ni–Mn–O nanohybrid electrodes demonstrated a desired energy density of 20.2 W h kg−1 and excellent cycling stability (about 93.2% retention after 2000 cycles at 20 A g−1). Electrospun CNFs coaxially decorated with porous worm-like NiMoO4 have also been produced via a hydrothermal process and calcination.172 As a conductive substrate, electrospun CNFs exhibit a smaller diameter and lighter mass when compared with conventional carbon cloth, which is favorable to increase the loading of NiMoO4, shorten ion/electron transport pathways and improve the utilization of NiMoO4. The resultant core–shell nanocomposites showed a high specific capacitance of 1088.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and good rate capability (860.3 F g−1 at 20 A g−1) when used as SC electrode. Na2Ti3O7 nanosheets with a thickness of 20 nm were uniformly coated on the electrospun CNFs (CNFs/NTO) through a hydrothermal process to form a hierarchical structure, which realized a specific energy of 47.5 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 900 W kg−1 when served as the anode in an ASC device using activated carbon fiber as the cathode.173 To further assess their practical functionality, a sodium ion hybrid capacitor based on CNFs/NTO as anode and AC fiber as cathode was constructed, presenting a working voltage of 3 V and a reasonable specific energy of 127.73 W h kg−1 at 95.79 W kg−1.
Different from post-synthesis processes to hybridize as-spun CNFs, by adding different stoichiometric ratios of Co and Ni precursors to the spinnable solution, Ranjith et al.174 decorated NiCo-based bimetallic oxide nanoparticles onto CNFs and subsequently heat-treated them as an electrode assembly. It was found that electrospinning became difficult and the CNF film became brittle after post-annealing when the concentration of the total metal precursor exceeded 60 wt% with respect to PAN in the spinnable solution. When the Co loading was increased from Ni40:Co20 to Ni20:Co40, the corresponding specific capacity increased from 80.2 C g−1 to 165.6 C g−1. The hybrid SC using CNFs/NixCoyO4 (Ni20:Co40) composites as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode exhibited high specific capacitance (191.4 F g−1), energy density (67.9 W h kg−1), power density (745.4 W kg−1) and cycling steadiness (88.9% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles).
Metal oxide–metal oxide composites can also be hybridized with CNFs to form high performance electrode materials for SCs. For instance, a bead-on-string nanostructure of electrosprayed MnO2 particles uniformly anchored on Fe(acac)3/PAN derived CNF/Fe3O4 nanofibers was reported.175 The resultant CNFs/Fe3O4/MnO2 composite membrane exhibited a specific capacitance of ∼306 F g−1 and high capacitance retention of approximately 85% after 2000 cycles. In another study, electrospun porous CNFs were prepared to be used as supporting backbones for controlled growth of thin layer Co3V2O8–Ni3V2O8 core–shell nanostructures to form a binder-free freestanding electrode.176 The CNFs/Co3V2O8–Ni3V2O8 composites exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1731 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and the ASC device based on the obtained CNFs/Co3V2O8–Ni3V2O8 hybrids as the positive electrode and CNFs as the negative electrode showed superior flexibility and reliability, high energy density (59.7 W h kg−1 at 1.97 kW kg−1), high power density (13.4 kW kg−1 at 40.6 W h kg−1) and outstanding cycling stability (88.5% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles at 5.0 A g−1). The superior performance was ascribed to the following aspects: (1) the highly conductive CNF network facilitated the electron transport to the Co3V2O8–Ni3V2O8 thin layer film, (ii) the thin layer structure of Co3V2O8–Ni3V2O8 not only ensured the synergetic effect of the three faradaic materials (cobalt, nickel, and vanadium) but also enhanced the diffusion and migration of electrolyte ions, and (iii) unlike coated electrodes, the freestanding structure avoids the use of a binder or current collector, which eliminates the additional contact resistance between the current collector and the active materials and reduces the total mass of the electrode.


3.2.3 Metal sulfide composites. 
As another potential pseudocapacitive electrode material, transition metal sulfides having outstanding mechanical stability, diverse structural types and fascinating electrochemical activities can also be introduced into electrospun CNFs for developing high-performance electrodes for SCs.
For instance, CoS2 particles with a size from 50 to 100 nm were uniformly grown on the surface of the electrospun CNFs through a hydrothermal reaction in cobalt acetate/thioacetamide solution.177 Owing to the synergistic effect, the obtained CNFs/CoS2 hybrids demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 378 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with excellent rate capability (75.6% capacitance retention at 10 A g−1), which was much higher than that of pristine CNFs of 14 F g−1 (28.5%) and individual CoS2 of 213.6 F g−1 (72.1%). By electrospinning a cobalt acetate/PAN precursor solution, followed by stabilization in air and in situ ion-exchange in 0.1 M thioacetamide/H2O solution, the Co3O4 phase was transformed into more electrochemically active Co9S8 phase during the ion-exchange process, and the resulting hybrids were further heated at 600 °C in N2 to produce CNFs/Co9S8 nanocomposites.178 The well-dispersed redox center, 100 nm-wide Co9S8 nanoparticles, along with well-formed porous CNFs jointly realized a high specific capacitance of 718 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which was much higher than that of the CNFs/Co3O4 electrode prepared without the sulfurization process (154 F g−1).
Moreover, cobalt nitrate/PAN spinnable solution derived CNFs/Co3O4 composites were converted to CoSx/carbon core–shell nanosphere decorated CNFs (CoSx/C nanofibers) through a hydrothermal reaction with sodium sulfide solution (Fig. 8a).179 Owing to the formation of an sp2 hybridized graphitic carbon layer structure, the resultant CoSx/C nanofibers with improved electronic conductivity and more desirable diffusion properties displayed a high specific capacitance of 496.8 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, which was nearly 2 times as large as that of CNFs/Co3O4 composites (Fig. 8b and c). In addition, a superior rate capability (328.3 F g−1 at 100 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (89.4% retention at 10 A g−1 after 2000 cycles) were also achieved, indicating a synergistic effect from CNFs and CoSx (Fig. 8d and e).

NiS is another ideal candidate to hybridize CNFs as electrode materials for SCs. By the use of a blend of PVA/oxidized coal/TEOS dissolved in DMF, Tong et al.180 produced CNFs/SiO2 nanocomposites, and the SiO2 particles were successively converted to nickel silicate and NiS via twice hydrothermal treatments. The resultant mesoporous CNFs/NiS nanocomposites displayed an excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 635.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. By using the CNFs/NiS nanocomposites as the positive electrode and coal-based CNFs as the negative electrode, the ASC delivered a high energy density of 13.8 W h kg−1 at a power density of 373.9 W kg−1. In another study, CNFs wrapped with NiS nanoparticles (CNFs/NiS) were prepared by Jia et al.181via a carbonization process of electrospun PAN/PVP/Ni(NO3)2 nanofibers and subsequent in situ sulfurization. The porous CNFs/NiS electrode with a surface area of 376 m2 g−1 showed a specific capacity of 177.1 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 2 M KOH and excellent cycling stability with 88.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles.
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been widely studied as a promising energy storage material based on its unique charge storage mechanism and higher theoretical capacity than graphite.182–184 Moreover, the Mo atoms in MoS2 behave like ruthenium with several oxidization states and can realize a more efficient faradaic charge transfer process.185 According to Wang et al.,186 porous CNFs/MoS2 nanofibers fabricated by carbonizing an electrospun MoS2/PVA composite mat could realize less wasted energy during the charge–discharge process and lower interfacial charge transfer resistance than the pure MoS2 electrode, offering a high specific capacitance of 355.6 F g−1 in 6 M KOH. Ju et al.187 utilized an electro-blown spinning and hydrothermal method to produce MoS2 nanoflake coated 3D CNFs, which exhibited good electrical conductivity (22.32 S cm−1) due to the introduction of CNF skeletons as fast conduction paths. A Li-ion capacitor assembled using the prepared CNFs/MoS2 as the anode and commercial AC as the cathode achieved high energy density and excellent cycle stability owing to the synergies of MoS2 and CNFs. Similarly, transition metal sulfides such as iron sulfide (FeS) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) have been demonstrated as an electrode material for SCs. For instance, FeS nanoparticle decorated CNFs were fabricated via electrospinning, carbonization and a hydrothermal reaction.188 Compared with pure FeS, the resultant CNFs/FeS composites with better electronic conductivity revealed a greatly enhanced specific capacitance of 502 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 in 6 M KOH and excellent cycling performance (90% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles). The synergistic effect between FeS and CNFs not only accommodated the volume expansion of FeS but also promoted the diffusion of ions and transport of electrons, thereby accounting for the remarkable electrochemical performance. Transition metal sulfides with better utilization of the active sites could realize a more attractive synergistic effect, thus boosting the overall performance. Through electrospinning, carbonization and a hydrothermal treatment, CNFs coated with uniformly grown WS2 nanosheets (15 nm thickness) were fabricated (Fig. 9a and b).189 The resultant CNFs/WS2 composites showed a superior capacitive performance to pristine CNFs and pure WS2, and two well-defined redox peaks indicated the contribution of faradaic redox reactions derived from WS2 to boosting the overall capacitance. The obtained CNFs/WS2 composites possessed a high capacitance of 600 F g−1 (3108 F cm−3) at 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH, much higher than that of pure WS2 electrodes (360 F g−1, 2149 F cm−3). Furthermore, an ASC based on CNFs/WS2 composites as the cathode and CNFs as the anode also delivered a high capacitance of 237.7 F g−1 (514.1 F cm−3) at 1 A g−1 and a promising energy density of 83.3 W h kg−1 with a power density of 2168.29 W kg−1 (Fig. 9c–f). Furthermore, binary and mixed-metal sulfides with higher electronic conductivity and richer redox reactions have also been widely studied as electrode materials in energy storage and conversion systems.190–192 Among them, electrospun CNFs/binary transition metal sulfides composites are promising electrode materials for SCs (Table 2).

3.2.4 Metal nitride composites. 
Like metals, metal oxides, and metal sulfides, the addition of transition metal nitrides can also endow electrospun CNFs with new properties, improved capacitance and energy densities. However, the electrochemical stability of TMNs like VN is not ideal in general. In order to overcome this shortcoming and further improve the capacitive properties of TMNs, vanadium nitride quantum dot (diameter below 2 nm) doped N-CNFs with good wettability and a microporous structure were developed by Ran et al.197via electrospinning a V2O5/PVP/H2O2 precursor solution, and calcination of the as-spun fibers under an atmosphere of NH3:N2 = 3:2, which realized a high specific capacitance of 406.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a good rate capability (75.1% at 5.0 A g−1) in 6 M KOH. Additionally, two-electrode tests were performed based on CNFs/VN as the negative electrode and Ni(OH)2 as the positive electrode, and the hybrid device displayed a comparable energy density of 31.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 774.6 W kg−1 (20.5 W h kg−1 at 3875 W kg−1). Generally, CNFs/metal oxide composites and CNFs/metal nitride composites are always tested in an alkaline or neutral aqueous electrolyte, in order to widen the practice of SCs based on TMNs in an acidic environment; Tan et al.198 used PAN/PVP/ammonium molybdate spin dopes and carbonization/ammonization treatment in a mixed gas atmosphere of N2 and NH3 to prepared CNFs/MoxN composites. The obtained CNFs/MoxN nanofibers with a 200 nm diameter were stable in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution and exhibited a high specific capacitance of 251 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 as well as long cycle life (capacitance retention of 85.7% after 10000 cycles). Furthermore, the ASC device based on PANI as the positive electrode and CNFs/MoxN as the negative electrode showed a maximum energy density of 14.1 W h kg−1 and power density of 312 W kg−1, as well as good cycle life (capacitance retention of 78.6% at 2 A g−1 after 15000 cycles). In Wang's study, through the coordination of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N with Fe, binder-free CNFs/Fe–Nx composite electrodes were fabricated through a facile electrospinning technique and subsequent carbonization treatment.199 The CNFs/Fe–Nx composites derived from Fe(pca)2Cl(CH3OH)2n·nCH3OH/PAN precursor solution revealed a high capacitance of 629 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent stability (97% capacitance retention after 2500 cycles at 5 A g−1) in 4 M KOH. The superior capacitive performance can be attributed to the formation of the Fe–N bond and N-doped CNFs that jointly promoted electronic transport.


3.2.5 Metal phosphide composites. 
Transition metal phosphides with multielectron orbitals, intrinsically outstanding electrochemical activity and exceptional electronic conductivity have recently emerged as a potential candidate material for use in SCs.200–202 When combined with electrospun CNFs, the synergies in the CNFs/metal phosphide composites can greatly enhance the overall performance, yet little work has been done on SCs.
Functionalizing electrospun CNFs with bimetallic phosphides enables the material to become more active and applicable for energy storage. As shown in Fig. 10a–g, Surendran et al.299 utilized a facile electrospinning and subsequent controlled pyrolysis method to develop NiCoP nanoparticles encapsulated with CNFs. Through redox reactions, the bimetal centers with admirable electrochemical activity in the phosphide structure could provide an abundant electron transfer mechanism that enables superior charge storage efficiency. On the other hand, 1D CNFs could offer a continuous electronic transport pathway and promote the generation of double-layered capacitance. Benefiting from the synergistic interaction between different active parts and morphological virtues, the obtained CNFs/NiCoP electrode unveiled a superior specific capacity of 167 C g−1 at 2 A g−1 (333 F g−1) and rate capability of 87% retention at 10 A g−1. Furthermore, the fabricated symmetric device also revealed a high specific capacitance of 269 F g−1 at 1.5 A g−1 and delivered a grander energy density (36 W h kg−1) and power density (4000 W h kg−1) along with unwavering cycling stability (25000 cycles) (Fig. 10h–k). The correlation between the molar ratios of Ni/Co bimetal and corresponding capacitive performance along with the effect of incorporating NixCoyP into CNFs was studied in Gopalakrishnan's work.203 NixCoyP samples of different Ni/Co molar ratios (1:9, 2:8, 3:7 and 5:5) were prepared and tested as electrodes for SCs, and it was found that the Ni1Co9P sample showed the optimized performance with a capacitance of 160 F g−1 at 0.8 A g−1 in 6 M KOH. Moreover, the prepared Ni1Co9P hollow nanospheres were synthesized onto electrospun PAN-derived CNFs via a one-step electrospinning process consisting of electrospinning and subsequent carbonization at 1000 °C under an argon atmosphere. The obtained CNFs/NiCoP nanocomposite electrode exhibited an enhanced specific capacitance of 200 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 compared with pure Ni1Co9P hollow nanospheres, as well as an excellent capacitance retention of 88.5% after 5000 cycles due to the synergistic action between the CNFs and two metals in bimetallic compounds.

3.2.6 Metal carbide composites. 
Incorporating metal carbides with strong metal-to-carbon bonding into electrospun CNFs to form CNFs/metal carbide composites can lead to enhanced properties. For instance, both TiC and TaC nanoparticles could be well-embedded into the CNF matrix with a homogeneous distribution via electrospinning followed by a carbothermal reduction. The resultant CNFs/TiC felt and CNFs/TiC membrane both possessed excellent electronic conductivity and mechanical flexibility.204,296 Two types of CNFs/TiC composites were produced by electrospinning a PVP/tetrabutyl titanate/acetic acid precursor solution, followed by stabilization in air or Ar and carbonization at 1400 °C in Ar.205 The CNFs/TiC composites stabilized in air (CNFs/TiC–air) contained less TiC than those stabilized in Ar (CNFs/TiC–Ar), exhibiting a higher specific surface area of 340.1 m2 g−1 compared with CNFs/TiC–Ar (116.5 m2 g−1). Consequently, The specific capacitance of CNFs/TiC–air is higher than that of CNFs/TiC–Ar (130.0 F g−1 and 77.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively), both of which are much higher than those of the CNFs (3.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and the commercial TiC nanoparticles (25.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). Moreover, the capacitance retention of CNFs/TiC–air and CNFs/TiC–Ar was 93.0% and 98.9% after 25000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1, respectively. The reversible valence change of Ti atoms during the charge/discharge process indicated that pseudo-reactions existed. There is much interest in developing MXene fibers as energy storage materials to be used in devices like wearable electronics due to their exceptional conductivity (10000 S cm−1 for a freestanding film), favorable electrochemical activity and mechanical flexibility.206,207 However, only a few studies have been reported on integrated MXene fiber composites for SCs. Recently, Ti3C2Tx MXene flake-embedded CNFs were reported by Levitt's group.208 Through electrospinning a precursor solution containing Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes, PAN and DMF, electrospun Ti3C2Tx/PAN fibers with high MXene mass loadings can be prepared and the flakes inside the fibers are well aligned with the fiber axis; the as-spun fibers were further subjected to carbonization treatment at 800 °C in Ar to form CNFs/MXene composites with a decreased fiber diameter and a phase transformation (Fig. 11a–c). The resultant CNFs/Ti3C2Tx MXene electrode (containing TiC) exhibited outstanding cycling steadiness and revealed a high areal capacitance of 239 mF cm−2 at 10 mV s−1, which was 3 times higher that of pure CNFs (Fig. 11d and e). Presser et al.209 prepared T–NbC/carbon hybrid nanofibers by applying a carbothermal reduction to NbBO/Ac2O/PVP-derived electrospun fibers. An asymmetric setup based on the freestanding T–NbC/C nanofiber mat and AC revealed a specific energy of 86 W h kg−1 owing to rapid ion transport and the co-existence of the graphitic carbon. G-CNTs/CNFs/W2C composites were prepared by electrospinning a graphene oxide nanoribbon-CNT hybrids/(NH4)2WS4/PAN precursor solution with subsequent carbonization under a H2/Ar atmosphere.210 With fast electron/ion transport pathways offered by CNFs, improved electronic conductivity afforded by G-CNT hybrids, as well as abundant electroactive sites provided by the homogeneous distribution of small-sized W2C nanoparticles, the CNTs/CNF/W2C composites exhibited a specific capacitance of 256 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, good rate capacitance retention of 71% at 10 A g−1, and good cycling stability of 95.6% retention after 2500 cycles. Apart from single-phase carbides, incorporating a second metal to form bimetallic carbides can lead to enhanced stability and redox reactions. Recently, Liu et al.211 prepared CNFs/Fe2MoC composites by electrospinning a PVP/FeCl2·4H2O/(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O precursor solution followed by stabilization at 250 °C in air and carbonization at 800 °C in Ar. The obtained CNFs/Fe2MoC nanofibers with a specific surface area of 196.9 m2 g−1 exhibited a high specific capacitance of 347.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1 M KOH, superior rate capability (91% capacitance retention from 1 A g−1 to 40 A g−1) and cycle stability (capacitance retention of about 85.6% after 5000 cycles). Based on CNFs/Fe2MoC as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode, an ASC device displayed an energy density of 14.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 300 W kg−1 and an outstanding cycling life of 93% retention after 5000 cycles.

3.2.7 Heterogeneous nanocarbon composites. 
The development of new advanced nanostructures based on the hybridization of different carbon nanomaterials to obtain enhanced performance of energy storage devices has attracted considerable attention. Graphene is a widely used additive to improve the electrochemical performance of pure electrospun CNFs (Table 2). For example, CNFs/graphene composites were prepared by electrospinning polymeric nanofibers with simultaneous spraying graphene oxide, followed by heat treatment.212 The resultant CNF/graphene composites exhibited a specific capacitance of 183 F g−1, which was approximately 1.6 times higher than that of the pristine CNFs due to the enhanced electronic conductivity derived from graphene and a spatial isolation for graphene provided by the CNF matrix.
Cellulose-derived CNFs/graphene composite electrodes were fabricated via carbonization/reduction of cellulose/graphene oxide mats at 800 °C.213 In this material, CNFs acted as nano-spacers in the interpenetrated CNFs/rGO network, which realized an excellent volumetric electrochemical performance with promising volumetric values of capacitance, energy and power density (up to 46 F cm−3, 1.46 W h L−1 and 1.09 kW L−1, respectively). Recently, hollow N-doped CNFs embedded with graphene nanosheets (GNs) that expanded and connected adjacent CNFs were synthesized (Fig. 12a and b).214 Compared with pristine CNFs, CNFs/GNs with a 2 wt% weight ratio of GNs showed an improved electrochemical performance with a capacitance of 249 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a three-electrode system. Furthermore, a two-electrode symmetrical cell based on CNFs/GNs achieved extraordinary cycling stability and reversibility with no capacitance degradation after 5000 cycles. Zhang et al.215 fabricated graphene–N–S co-doped lignin/PAN-based CNFs with a high BET surface area of 2439 m2 g−1. The assembled symmetric device based on the graphene modified CNF electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance of 267.32 F g−1, low equivalent series resistance of 5.67 Ω, and outstanding cycling stability of 96.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles in 6 M KOH; more importantly, CNF doping with GNs increased the energy density from 4.12 to 9.28 W h kg−1 and at the same time with barely reduced power density. Fan et al.216 reported a simple strategy to integrate both a conductive network and a well-developed porous structure into electrospun CNFs by adding graphene quantum dots (GQDs) in the spinnable solution. Compared with the pure CNFs, the GQD-reinforced activated CNFs exhibited a greatly enlarged surface area from 140 to 2032 m2 g−1 as well as a significantly improved conductivity and strength by 5.5 and 2.5 times, respectively. Moreover, the CNFs/GQD composite electrode exhibited a high capacitance of 335 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 as well as excellent rate capability (150 F g−1 at 500 A g−1). Importantly, a symmetric device based on the CNFs/GQD composites can be charged to 80% capacitance within only 2.2 s, showing great potential for high-power startup supplies. Besides, electrospun CNFs/graphene oxide composites have also been reported since graphene oxide may be a better choice than graphene as an electrode material for SCs in some cases.217–219

Similar to graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with a unique 1D tubular structure and excellent electrical conductivity can also be introduced into electrospun CNFs in order to increase the electrochemical activity of the electrospun CNFs and influence their architecture. Growing CNTs on the surface of the electrospun CNFs could be an effective approach to enhance the capacitive performance of electrode materials in SCs. For instance, a symmetrical device based on CNF/CNT hybrid electrodes exhibited a specific capacitance of 3.35 ± 0.05 mF cm−2, which was 3.6 times higher than that of a pure CNF electrode-based device (0.91 ± 0.02 mF cm−2).220 A hierarchical nanostructure of CNFs/CNTs was synthesized through a CVD process by using C2H2 as the carbon precursor and Ni nanoparticles on CNFs as catalysts.221Fig. 12c shows an SEM image of the CNFs/CNTs nanocomposites, demonstrating the formation of a hierarchical network structure consisting of densely grown CNTs on the surface of the CNFs. The obtained CNFs/CNT electrode showed a specific capacitance of 464.2 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH and excellent stability with 97% retention after 10000 cycles. The excellent performance was ascribed to the following aspects: (i) the intimate contact between the CNTs (to provide electrical conduction from the tip of each CNT to the edges and surfaces of the CNFs) and the CNFs; (ii) the interconnected and porous CNFs acting as an excellent path facilitated charge transfer and electrolyte permeation. Hierarchical CNFs/CNT hybrids were prepared via a tubular CVD growth process using Al/Fe composite catalysts.222 After KOH activation, the tips of CNTs in the hybrids can be well opened at 700 °C without changing the overall hierarchical structure. More interestingly, the tip-open CNFs/CNT hybrids showed a considerably improved specific capacitance, which increases to 3.3 times that of the pristine one. Moreover, sweep analysis indicated that the diffusion-type capacitance increases by 3.7 times while the Helmholtz-type capacitance increases by only 1.5 times, indicating that the tip-open CNTs contribute to ∼30% of the increase in double-layer capacitance. In another study, CNFs/CNT scaffolds were fabricated by the electrospinning technique combined with post-carbonization processes.223 The diameters of CNF skeletons, CNT density on CNF skeletons and length of CNTs were determined by the PAN concentration, Fe(acac)3 concentration in precursor solution and growth time of C2H2 flow, respectively. It was observed that a suitable size of CNF skeletons, CNT density and growth time of CNTs could greatly enhance the overall performance.
In a recent study, a ternary carbon aerogel structure of graphene/CNFs/CNT nanocomposites was produced.224 The graphene/CNFs/CNT electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 521.5 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1 and a capacitance retention of 98% after 10000 consecutive cycles at 5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH. An ASC device with the graphene/CNFs/CNT negative electrode and NiCo2S4/Ni foam positive electrode showed a capacitance of 218 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 91.7% retention after 10000 cycles, as well as an energy density of 62.13 W h kg−1 at 789.66 W kg−1 power density (Fig. 12d–f).


3.2.8 Metal hydroxide composites. 
Similar to other CNF-based composites, electrospun CNFs/metal hydroxide hybrids have also been designed and investigated as electrode materials for SCs in recent years due to the attractive capacitive performance of metal hydroxides and their composites (Table 2).225,226
Liu et al.227 produced flexible membrane electrodes for SCs consisting of ultrathin Ni(OH)2 nanoplatelets vertically anchored on PI-based CNFs via electrospinning and chemical bath deposition. The CNFs not only acted as a conductive core to provide efficient transport of electrons for stable faradaic redox reactions of the Ni(OH)2 sheath, but also served as a buffering matrix to accommodate the local volumetric expansion/contraction of Ni(OH)2 nanoplatelets. Consequently, the CNFs/Ni(OH)2 hybrids showed a specific capacitance of 2523 F g−1 (based on the mass of Ni(OH)2) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, about almost 10 times as large as that of pure Ni(OH)2. In Mukhiya's work, novel nanohaired 3D cobalt hydroxide wheels were uniformly inserted in electrospun CNFs by using an electrospinning cum hydrothermal method (Fig. 13a).228 The Co(OH)2 wheels with a thickness of about 600 nm and approximately 2.5 μm diameter encircled and firmly held the lightweight CNF networks, which were composed of β-Co(OH)2 nanoleaflets furnished with hierarchical nanohairs, resulting in strong adherence between the Co(OH)2 wheels and the CNF networks (Fig. 13b). Based on the unique structure and synergies from each component, the prepared CNFs/Co(OH)2 composites exhibited an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1186 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with an excellent cycling stability of 94.9% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles (Fig. 13c–f). The ASC device based on the CNFs/Co(OH)2 positive electrode and nitrogen doped graphene (NGD) hydrogel negative electrode in a 2 M KOH electrolyte also displayed a satisfactory energy density of 60.31 W h kg−1 at a power density of 740.8 W kg−1 which still remained at 37 W h kg−1 at a higher power density of 7500 W kg−1 with a remarkable cycle life (Fig. 13g and h). The hybrid nanostructures of layered double hydroxide (LDH) and electrospun CNFs can also endow SCs with superior electrochemical properties. Liu et al.229 incorporated Ni–Co LDH with two different morphologies including nanorods and nanosheets into PAN-derived CNFs via a solution co-deposition method. The obtained CNFs/Ni–Co LDH nanorods and CNFs/Ni–Co LDH nanosheet hybrids were able to deliver high specific capacitances of 1378.2 F g−1 and 1195.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, the cycling stabilities of both hybrid membranes are significantly enhanced compared with those of Ni–Co LDH nanorod and nanosheet powders.

3.2.9 Metal–organic framework composites. 
Recently, electrospun CNFs/MOF hybrids have been shown to be an attractive class of SC electrodes. Like electrospun CNFs, MOFs can also be prepared with desired compositions and morphologies; and the combination of electrospun CNFs and MOFs may have promising applications in SCs since this strategy is quite versatile and can be easily extended for the fabrication of more well-defined nanostructures with an attractive specific surface area, high redox activity, and favorable conductivity. For instance, Li et al.230 utilized electrospinning followed by surface functionalization and rinse treatment to prepare CNFs/ZIF-8 hybrid membranes. For this purpose, electrospun PAN-derived CNFs were treated by a green O3 treatment to introduce active groups for the growth of ZIF-8, and the resulting surface-functionalized CNFs were alternatively immersed in Zn(OAc)2 solution and 2-methylimidazole solution, obtaining the final CNFs/ZIF-8 hybrid membrane, which delivered a high specific capacitance of 640 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 and excellent rate performance (72.3% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1). It was found that the sluggish kinetics of ZIF-8 was addressed by sufficient electrolyte contact and improved electron transport.
In another study, a 2D conductive Ni-MOF nanorod array was grown on the surface of electrospun CNFs through a hydrothermal method, which lead to a uniform core–shell structure.231 The 1D porous structure of the CNFs/Ni-MOF nanohybrids not only facilitated the diffusion kinetics of electrons and ions, but also kept the electrode integrity and prevented Ni-MOF from undergoing aggregation. In addition, the Ni-MOF nanorod array can further ensure the sufficient contact of the electrochemically active materials with the electrolyte. The hierarchical CNFs/Ni-MOF nanohybrids showed a lower charge transport resistance than pure Ni-MOF and revealed a high specific capacitance of 502.95 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 with an excellent cycling stability of 73% capacitance retention over 5000 cycles. Moreover, the ASC device assembled by using CNFs/Ni-MOF as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode possessed high energy density versus power density (18.67 W h kg−1versus 297.12 W kg−1) and 106.19% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles.


3.2.10 Conducting polymer composites. 
Conducting polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT), PVA, polyaniline (PANI), polythiophene, polypyrrole (PPy), polyacetylene, poly(4-styrene sulfonate) (PSS), poly-phenylene-vinylene (PPV), etc. are a renowned group of pseudocapacitive materials as well, and often their crosslinking features easily fasten, expose and tightly hold the surface-anchored materials like metal oxides, and offer a better conducting network to ensure ultrafast charge transport. There has been longstanding interest to prompt synergies between EDLC electrode materials and pseudo-capacitive materials. Electrospun CNFs coated with distinctive nanostructured conducting polymers, usually fabricated through post-modification of electrospun CNFs, enable to realize the full utilization of active pseudocapacitor materials in some reports, and they have been widely studied in recent years in order to improve the capacity of SCs further.232–234
PANI has been the pioneering conducting polymer to hybridize with CNFs as an electrode material for SCs. In an early study in 2011, Xue et al.235 produced CNFs/PANI composites by simply applying a rapid-mixture polymerization process to electrospun CNFs. The specific capacitances of the resultant CNFs/PANI composites and the pristine electrospun CNFs were 638 and 317 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, respectively. It was believed that the improved specific capacitance and electronic conductivity were due to the combination effect of the layer-by-layer structure of CNFs, the small size of PANI nanoparticles and the interaction between PANI nanoparticles and CNFs. According to Lau et al.,236 by applying an oxidative chemical vapor deposition reaction, porous PANI with a thickness of ∼160 nm was coated on PAN-derived CNFs. The obtained CNFs/PANI electrode showed a specific capacitance of 149 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 that comes primarily from the deposited porous PANI. In Shao's work, nitrogen-doped CNFs can be easily obtained via a carbonization treatment of stabilized electrospun PAN/PANI composite nanofibers, and the resulting N-doped CNFs can be further converted to PANI-modified N-doped CNFs with a core–shell structure through an in situ polymerization approach.237 Owing to the well-designed architecture and synergistic effect between CNFs and PANI, the symmetric device based on the CNFs/PANI nanocomposites exhibited outstanding rate capability with a specific capacitance retention of 60% when the current density increased from 0.5 to 12 A g−1 (260 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), as well as excellent cycling steadiness (80.1% retention after 10000 cycles at 2 A g−1). Self-standing CNFs/PANI nanocomposites (20 nm thickness of PANI) were fabricated by applying galvanostatic deposition of aniline to the PAN-derived CNFs.238 When used as SC electrode, the prepared CNFs/PANI nanocomposites showed an outstanding specific capacitance of 320 F g−1 at 20 mV s−1 in a 1 M Li2SO4 electrolyte as well as high rate capability (256 F g−1 at 100 mV s−1), which should be due to strong π–π interaction between PANI chains and CNFs. Mao and co-workers239 produced novel electrodes for yarn- or fiber-shaped supercapacitors (YSCs or FSCs) consisting of hierarchical sheath-core carbon fiber yarns (CFY)/CNFs/PANI heterostructures, by applying in situ polymerization of aniline to CFY/CNFs prepared by using a modified electrospinning setup, giving rise to the formation of PANI nanowire arrays grown on the CFY/CNFs (Fig. 14a and b). The areal specific capacitance achieved by these electrodes was 234 mF cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2, which was much higher than that of pristine CFY/CNF electrodes (62 mF cm−2). In addition, YSCs based on the prepared CFY/CNFs/PANI electrodes also gave an energy density of 21.4 μW h cm−2 at a power density of 0.52 mW cm−2 in an organic electrolyte, reveling the great contribution of the introduced PANI to the overall electrochemical performance (Fig. 14c and d).

Poly(m-aminophenol) (PmAP) is a less studied conducting polymer in SCs and advantageous for introducing both nitrogen and oxygen functional groups into CNFs, which would facilitate the wettability of CNFs. CNFs/PmAP nanohybrids were prepared through in situ polymerization of m-aminophenol in the presence of CNFs.240 With a PmAP loading of approximately 42 wt%, in 1 M H2SO4, the obtained CNFs/PmAP hybrid mats exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 325.8 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, a maximum energy density of 45.2 W h kg−1 and a power density of 20.4 kW kg−1. As aforementioned, by adding other carbonaceous materials such as graphene, CNTs, carbon black (CB), etc. into CNFs, the synergistic reinforcing effects including a larger specific surface area and higher electronic conductivity can be easily obtained. Actually, the combination of electroactive conducting polymers, CNFs and other nanocarbons can also lead to an enhanced electrochemical performance compared with that of binary CNFs/conducting polymer composites since the introduction of nanocarbons could boost the overall electronic conductivity and chemical stability of the ternary composite nanofibers. Recently, ternary CNFs/PPy/rGO core–shell fibers were tested as electrodes of SCs in a PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte and showed an enhanced specific capacitance of 836.87 mF cm−2, which was higher than those of binary CNFs/PPy composites (701.32 mF cm−2) and pure CNFs (109.5 mF cm−2).241 The ternary composites also possessed superb cycling stability with 86% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. In another study, aniline monomer was coated on PAN/CNT-derived CNFs/CNT composites via in situ polymerization to form CNFs/CNTs/PANI nanohybrids.242 Owing to the high surface area resulting from CNT incorporation and interaction between the CNF–CNT and PANI, the resultant CNFs/CNTs/PANI electrode showed a much higher specific capacitance of 1119 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 compared to the bare CNF film (278 F g−1). Ding et al.243 utilized electrospinning followed by carbonization and electrospray processes to prepare CB@CNFs/PANI nanocomposites, consisting of PANI deposited on the surface of the as-prepared electrospun CB@CNF composite membrane (PANI loading of 41 mg g−1). The resultant CB@CNFs/PANI nanocomposite fibers gave an exceptional specific capacitance of 501.6 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, as well as excellent capacitance retention of 91% after 5000 cycles.

3.3 Carbon-free metal oxide NFs for SCs
Based on the above-mentioned discussion, metal oxides have been recognized as promising electrode materials for SCs due to their rich redox chemistry and intrinsic capability in energy storage. In addition to composites with carbon materials, devising a specific morphology is another interesting approach to enhance the electrochemical performance of metal oxides. For instance, one dimensional metal oxides offer facile electronic and ionic transport and strong tolerance to stress change, contributing to high performance for SCs. Fortunately, electrospinning technology is an impelling method to fabricate such one-dimensional metal oxides by post-treatment of electrospun fibers under air atmosphere. In this section, electrospun metal oxides are discussed as the representative materials of pseudo-capacitive materials (Table 3).

3.3.1 Unitary metal oxides. 
Among various metal oxides, ruthenium oxide is one of the most promising pseudo-capacitor materials due to its excellent proton transport characteristics. For example, highly conducting (288 S cm−1) electrospun RuO2 fiber mats, composed of crystalline RuO2 nanoparticles with an average particle size of 10 nm, exhibited a high specific capacitance of 886.9 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 have been reported in 2010.244
Manganese oxides with mixed oxidation states have been extensively studied as SC electrodes due to their rich pseudocapacitive reactions.245 However, the low oxidation state of Mn (x < 2) in MnOx could result in insufficient specific capacitance. Sawangphruk et al.246 prepared electrospun Mn3O4 nanofibers derived from PAN/manganese acetate tetrahydrate polymer solution and investigated the charge storage mechanism of Mn3O4 nanofibers. The symmetric SC constructed from the obtained Mn3O4 nanofibers displayed a specific capacitance of 289 F g−1 in 0.5 M Na2SO4. It was found that the average oxidation state of Mn in the as-synthesized Mn3O4 (+2.67) decreased to +2.61 and +2.38 in the anode and cathode during the first charge, respectively, indicating a phase transformation from Mn3O4 into NaδMnOx·nH2O. Moreover, in situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements indicated that solvated Na+ during charging/discharging with a mass change of 80 ng cm−2 on the Mn3O4 nanofibers played a significant role in the charge storage mechanism of Mn3O4. In another earlier study, by applying a galvanostatic oxidation process to MnOx nanofibers derived from PVP/manganese(III)-acetylacetonate polymer solution to increase the valence of Mn in the MnOx nanofibers, δ-MnO2 nanofibers with an open network structure have been successfully fabricated.247 The obtained δ-MnO2 nanofibers with a mass loading of 1.2 mg cm−2 exhibited a higher specific capacitance of 380 F g−1 than the calcined MnOx nanofibers (250 F g−1) in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. In order to avoid nano-reunion of nanoparticle electrodes, Chen's group utilized electrospinning and subsequent frozen section process to fabricate MnO2 nanofibers made of 10 nm scale nanoparticles. The MnO2-based SC displayed a capacitance of 420 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, as well as good stability (92% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles).248 By using electrospun CNFs as a sacrificial template, hollow nanofibers with open and free interspaces made of ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets have been fabricated by Hu et al.249 The MnO2 nanofiber electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 291 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, as well as excellent cycling stability of 90.9% retention after 5000 cycles. Recently, Mn2O3 nanofibers were prepared by simple single nozzle electrospinning followed by annealing at 200, 300, 400 and 500 °C for 3 h. It was observed that the capacitive contribution of the Mn2O3 sample gently increased with the annealing temperature due to a conversion from an amorphous to a crystalline Mn2O3 structure when the temperature exceeded 300 °C and the sample annealed at 300 °C showed a maximum specific capacitance of 526 F g−1 at 0.5 mA cm−2 in 1 M Na2SO4.250
Electrospun NiO with different nanostructures has also been widely studied in SCs. For instance, by electrospinning a PVP/nickel nitrate/citric acid polymer solution followed by a subsequent annealing process to remove PVP, NiO hollow nanofibers comprised of NiO sheets with a diameter of 17 nm were prepared.251 The resultant NiO nanofibers exhibited a higher pseudocapacitance (336 F g−1 at 5 mA cm−2) than the solid NiO nanofibers fabricated without citric acid (136 F g−1). In another reference, by using electrospun PAA as a sacrificial template, NiO hollow nanofibers consisting of NiO nanoparticles with diameters varying from 10 to 30 nm were synthesized through a direct ion-exchange process in oversaturated Ni(NO3)2 solution, followed by air annealing. The NiO nanofibers with a porous structure and empty space can accommodate large volume changes and exhibited a high specific capacitance of 700 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, as well as a remarkable rate capability (80% capacitance retention with the current density increasing from 1 to 5 A g−1).252 In addition, electrospun nickel acetate/PVP-derived NiO nanofibers were applied as cathode materials for ASCs (AC as the anode). The device delivered a specific capacitance of 141 F g−1 with an energy density of 43.75 W h kg−1 and power density of 7.5 kW kg−1.253
Co3O4 is another intriguing material with a high theoretical capacitance of 3560 F g−1. In the last decade, specific capacitances including 340 F g−1, 407 F g−1 and 1110 F g−1 have been reported for electrospun Co3O4 nanofibers in SCs.254–256 By controlling the gradient distribution of PVA molecular weights during the electrospinning process, Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O/PVA derived Co3O4 mesoporous nanotubes were synthesized and selected as electroactive materials for SCs, which delivered a stack capacitance of 25 F cm−3 at a scan rate of 0.01 V s−1.257
In comparison with MnOx, NiO and Co3O4, TiO2 with lower theoretical capacitance has also been tested as an electrode in SCs.258,259 For instance, by using TiO2 nanofibers, activated carbon and a PVA–H3PO4 membrane, a solid-state SC was fabricated, which delivered a specific capacitance of 310 F g−1.258 Recently, Ta-doped TiO2 nanofibers were synthesized through the electrospinning technique.260 In 1 M H2SO4, the 2% Ta-doped TiO2 nanofibers could deliver nearly two times higher specific capacitance than the undoped TiO2 counterpart (111 F g−1), which was attributed to the enhanced electronic conductivity of TiO2 stemming from the replacement of Ti4+ by Ta5+ in the lattice after doping. In addition to the most studied metal oxides mentioned above, Fe2O3, V2O5 and CuO have also been applied to SCs as electrodes. The first report on a pure iron oxide electrode composed of particles with sizes of 53 nm has demonstrated a specific capacitance of 256 F g−1 in 1 M LiOH.261 Recently, both interconnected Fe2O3 and V2O5 nanofibers with rich meso-/macro-pores were obtained via electrospinning and subsequent heat treatment. Owing to the hierarchical porous structure that acts as an excellent conductive highway for efficient electronic transfer and ion permeation, the resultant binder-free Fe2O3 and V2O5 electrodes gave specific capacitances of 255 F g−1 and 256 F g−1, respectively, at 2 mV s−1 in 1 M Na2SO4. Moreover, an all-solid-state ASC based on an Fe2O3 negative electrode and V2O5 positive electrode could be operated at up to 1.8 V and displayed a high energy density of 32.2 W h kg−1 at an average power density of 128.7 W kg−1.262 In 2012, pure electrospun V2O5 nanofibers with different structures have been synthesized and tested in two studies. These pure electrospun V2O5 nanofibers displayed a capacitance of around 200 F g−1 in both the studies.263,264 A high specific capacitance of 620 F g−1 (accounting for ∼35% of their theoretical capacitance) at 2 A g−1 in 6 M KOH was reported by Jose et al.265 for electrospun CuO nanowires in 2014. In another reference, an ASC device based on electrospun CuO nanowires as the anode and AC as the cathode was constructed and provided an enhanced voltage window (1.6 V), specific capacitance (83 F g−1), and threefold higher energy density (29.5 W h kg−1) than the AC-based symmetric capacitor (1.4 V, 33 F g−1, 11 W h kg−1).266


3.3.2 Spinel-type metal oxides. 
The capacitive performances of metal oxides are strongly affected by their architecture (scale, shape, surface area, chemical composition, diffusion pathway, electroactive sites, etc.), electronic conductivity and structural stability. Spinel oxides composed of different transition metals and their corresponding oxides are a significant class of energy storage materials owing to their novel-redox nature; importantly, they present better structural stability and electronic conductivity, and offer three-dimensional diffusion pathways with a tunable architecture, which are favorable for energy storage.
For instance, interconnected and porous CuCo2O4 webs were prepared via electrospinning and subsequent heat treatment at 500 °C in air, which exhibited a specific capacitance of 443.9 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 in 3 M KOH.267 Moreover, the ASC device fabricated by using CuCo2O4 as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode delivered an energy density of 0.806 mW h cm−3 at a power density of 7.8 mW cm−3, as well as good rate capability. The excellent performance can be ascribed to porous and interconnected webs that served not only as facile transport channels for OH− ions but also as continuous pathways for electron transport. Also the 3D web electrode with a large surface area minimized the contact impedance between the electrodes and electrolyte.
An early study in 2014 has shown that electrospun ZnCo2O4 nanofibers are a promising candidate for SCs with a high specific capacitance of 770 F g−1 at 10 A g−1 in 6 M KOH.268 Chen et al.269 fabricated a micro-supercapacitor composed of 10 electrospun ZnCo2O4 nanowire microelectrodes and found that the micro-supercapacitor could deliver a high areal energy density of 0.065 μW h cm−2 at 0.092 mW cm−2 and robust cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 92% after 10000 cycles. In another study, mesoporous ZnMn2O4 nanofibers with rich open voids were fabricated by electrospinning a precursor solution containing PVP, Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O and ethanol, followed by subsequent annealing treatment of the as-spun fibers at 400 °C in air.270 When employed as a working electrode for SCs, the obtained ZnMn2O4 nanofibers revealed a specific capacitance of 240 (±5) F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4, as well as a high specific energy density of 33.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1.
Other potential spinel nanomaterials with appealing capacitive performance like NiCo2O4 and NiMoO4 prepared by electrospinning were investigated for SC applications as well.271,272 For instance, by tuning the precursor polymers and heating rates, novel tube-in-tube hollow NiCo2O4 nanostructures were fabricated and exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1756 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with excellent rate capability (83% at 20 A g−1) in 2 M KOH.273 Four different mesoporous hierarchical structures of NiMoO4 were synthesized by Sivakumar et al.;274 amongst the different morphologies synthesized, hollow NiMoO4 nanofibers with the highest pore volume demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 1920 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and a superior capacity retention of 92% after 3000 cycles in 6 M KOH. Furthermore, a high specific energy density of 39 W h kg−1 was observed at a power density of 798 W kg−1 based on an ASC constructed with the hollow NiMoO4 nanofibers as the cathode and AC as the anode. Electrospun TiNb2O7 nanofibers have also been used as the anode in lithium ion capacitors in an early study in 2014.275 The lithium-ion hybrid capacitor based on the TiNb2O7 anode and AC cathode in non-aqueous media showed high energy and power densities of approximately 43 W h kg−1 and 3 kW kg−1, respectively. Moreover, TiNb2O7 with high-rate energy storage capability is receiving increasing interest since fast charging, great cycling stability, and high power density are required.276 Spinel LiMn2O4 is a prominent Li-ion insertion compound and promising for energy storage due to abundant Mn resource and its eco-friendly nature, yet LiMn2O4 usually suffers from capacity fading during electrochemical testing and surface micro-cracking when used as an electrode material. To resolve these difficulties, electrospun Nd3+ doped LiMn2O4 nanofibers were fabricated, and the lithium ion capacitor based on the electrospun LiNd0.01Mn1.99O4 nanofiber cathode and black pearl carbon (BPC) anode in 1 M LiNO3 displayed an energy density of 17 W h kg−1 and a power density of 397 W kg−1, as well as attractive capacity retention (86% after 2500 cycles).277 An ASC device comprised of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 spinel cathode and nitrogen doped graphene (NGD) as the anode was reported.278 The constructed LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/NDG SC could deliver a specific capacitance of 72 F g−1 at 0.5 mA cm−2 in 3 M LiNO3, as well as a maximum energy density of 15 W h kg−1 at a power density of 110 W kg−1. Furthermore, a voltage window of 1.3 V was achieved as well.


3.3.3 Perovskites. 
Perovskites, as another important class of mixed metal oxides, show promising capacitive performance toward SCs. Moreover, they are considered to show high energy densities and power densities based on their high concentration of oxygen vacancies.279,280 Zhang and co-workers prepared a series of perovskite-type metal oxides and applied them in SCs in 2015.281,282 For example, LaxSr1−xNiO3−d (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 1) nanofibers derived from a spinnable solution containing La(NO3)3·6H2O, Sr(NO3)2, Ni(NO3)3·6H2O, PVP and DMF displayed a maximum specific capacitance of 719 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4.282 Similarly, the effect of doping Ba and Ca on Sr, and Co, Fe, and Ni on Mn, respectively, on the supercapacitance of SrMnO3 nanofibers was also studied in George's work.283 Particularly, doping 20 mol% Ba into the SrMnO3 matrix significantly enhanced the specific capacitance from 321.7 F g−1 to up to 446.8 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, and such an improvement was mainly attributed to the increased oxygen vacancies derived from lattice distortions. Moreover, a high specific capacitance of 423 F g−1 with an energy density of 37.3 W h kg−1 at a power density 400 W kg−1 was demonstrated for an ASC based on the Sr0.8Ba0.2MnO3 positive electrode and AC negative electrode in 0.5 M Na2SO4. Besides, similar perovskite-type electrospun nanofibers such as La1−xSrxMn0.9Ni0.1O3 (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1) and LaxSr1−xFeO3 (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1) have also been reported for SC applications.284,285 Very recently, a high specific capacitances of 928.82 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 was obtained by electrospinning a polymer-based solution containing Gd(NO3)3, Sr(NO3)2, Ni(NO3)2 PVP and DMF, through annealing treatment at 650 °C in air, to form GdxSr1−xNiO3 (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 1) nanofibers.286 The GdxSr1−xNiO3 (0.3 ≤ x ≤ 1) nanofibers were still able to deliver 764.06 F g−1 in 1 M KOH. Moreover, an ASC (AC as the negative electrode and GdxSr1−xNiO3 as the positive electrode) device was able to reach a high energy density of 53.8 W h kg−1 (power density of 1 kW kg−1) at 1 A g−1, and a high power density of 20 kW kg−1 (energy density of 19.4 W h kg−1) at 20 A g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4.


3.3.4 Metal oxide–metal oxide composites. 
In the past few years, a variety of multicomponent metal oxide composites with unique heterostructures have been reported. For instance, in order to overcome the intrinsic drawback of low electronic conductivity of both MnO2 and TiO2, a 3D core–shell structure comprised of MnO2 nanosheets homogenously grown on electrospun 1D TiO2 nanofibers was constructed.287 The designed TiO2/MnO2 nanocomposites gave a maximum specific capacitance of 525 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1 (220 F g−1 for pure MnO2 nanosheets) and an excellent stability with 81% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. The enhancement was attributed to the formation of a unique heterostructure architecture in which the 1D TiO2 served not only as a short pathway to transport ions and electrons, but also as an interacted well with the MnO2 phase to jointly enhance the electronic conductivity of the hybrid electrode. Electrospun nanowires (NWs) comprised of highly conductive CuO and Co3O4 with high charge storability were prepared by electrospinning a CuAc/CoAc/PVA precursor solution followed by annealing at 500 °C in air.288 The resultant CuO/Co3O4 nanocomposite NWs are composed of densely packed particles with a size from 5 to 10 nm. Owing to the synergetic effects, the CuO/Co3O4 nanocomposite NWs possessed an enhanced specific capacitances of 1273 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 compared to those of Co3O4 NWs (1105 F g−1) and CuO NWs (657 F g−1) and superior cycling stability with no decay over 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH. In addition, a high energy density of 44 W h kg−1 at a power density of 14 kW kg−1 was also achieved in an ASC device based on a CuO/Co3O4 anode and AC cathode. Dong and co-workers utilized electrospinning, a hydrothermal method and subsequent heat treatment to prepare ultrathin NiMoO4 nanosheet decorated Co3O4 nanocomposites.289 The obtained hierarchical Co3O4/NiMoO4 nanostructures revealed a significantly enhanced specific capacitance of 913.25 F g−1 at 10 A g−1 and large capacitance retention of 88% with current density increased from 0.5 to 20 A g−1 as well as remarkable cycling stability.

4. Conclusion and outlook
Electrospun nanomaterials are very promising electrode materials for SCs in terms of outstanding electronic conductivity and electrolyte accessibility, rich and uniform porosity, and excellent structural stability. In this review, we extensively discussed the recent advances in electrospun nanomaterial electrodes for SCs. Firstly, pore engineering (i.e. activation, blend polymer electrospinning, addition of metal salts, and template method) and heteroatom doping as two major approaches to improve the electrochemical performance of electrospun CNFs were reviewed. Furthermore, due to their superb mechanical strength, high electronic conductivity, good compatibility and lightweight characteristics, CNFs acting as the attractive host/substrate for diverse electroactive materials such as metal oxides, metal phosphides, and metal–organic frameworks were summarized with critical insights. Finally, electrospun carbon-free materials represented by metal oxides in different compositions (spinel-type oxides, perovskites, metal oxide–metal oxide composites, etc.) and architectures (porous, hollow, core–shell, etc.) were also discussed. Despite increasingly successful examples demonstrating the great potential of electrospun nanomaterial electrodes, there are still challenges and opportunities in this field which have not been fully explored:
(i) Although some work has been done in the preparation of hierarchically porous N-doped CNFs, it is still challenging to develop CNFs with both multiscale porous structures and a high content of pyrrolic and pyridinic N dopants. Moreover, since a high specific surface area and heteroatom doping both contribute to the capacitance of CNFs, the evaluation of the heteroatom functionalities is important but still not easy. Hence, research should be conducted to investigate the mechanism with a focus on maximizing the synergistic effect of porous structures and heteroatom doping.
(ii) For the stability of CNF-based nanofibers, ensuring an effective interfacial adherence between the CNFs and the active materials and mono-dispersion of active materials is essential. Furthermore, surface chemistry modification of the active martials is also important.290,291 Meanwhile, increasing active material loading without compromising properties are of great significance. Therefore, ‘bottleneck’ problems such as the low conductivity, chemical structure instability, volume expansion and kinetic hysteresis of active materials in CNF-based nanofibers are expected to be resolved in this research area.
(iii) The declination of electronegativity from O to Te is connected with enhanced metallic properties and thus optimized electron states/transmittability in metal dichalcogenides.292–294 It is thus expected that metal selenides and tellurides hold great promise as attractive electrode materials for SCs due to their higher conductivity than their oxide and sulfide counterparts. However, very little attention has been paid to such compounds/CNF composites for SC applications.295
(iv) As aforementioned, metal oxides with a unique structure like multiple shells or complex interiors present superb electrochemical performances due to abundant inner voids, rich active sites and multiphase heterogeneous interfaces. Research should therefore be focused in that direction, specifically on how to precisely tailor and preserve such structures.
(v) Fiber SCs are recognized as one of the most robust power supplies for future wearable applications. However, approaches to produce fiber-shaped current collectors and electrodes are only applicable to very limited materials such as CNTs, graphene, and their composites. Thus, the preparation of porous structures consisting of 1D electrospun nanofibers that feature superb electronic conductivity, easy ion infiltration and transport, enhanced maintenance and durability to meet the demand for high-performance flexible SCs is promising.
(vi) Compared with commercialized materials like active carbon, electrospun nanofibers offer inherent advantages such as a unique 1D microstructure and excellent designability. Nevertheless, from the perspective of large-scale preparation and commercial applications, some challenges need to be solved: first, reducing the expensive cost of novel electrospun devices; second, finding green alternatives like water and ethyl alcohol to toxic and corrosive organic solvents. Consequently, electrospun nanofibers could be promising electrode materials for SCs.
