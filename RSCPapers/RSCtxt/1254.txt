    , Accepted 17th January 2022First published on 18th January 2022AbstractIn this study, we demonstrate the design and fabrication of a novel flexible nanoarchitecture by facile coating ultrathin copper stannate nanoparticles (Cu2SnO4 NPs) grown radially on nickel foam (NF) to achieve a high specific capacitance, high-energy density, high-power density, and long-term life for supercapacitor electrode applications. The structural and morphological properties of the material were characterized using different techniques. The Cu2SnO4 NPs were used as the active electrode material for supercapacitor applications. The electrochemical properties of the Cu2SnO4 NPs as a binder-free electrode for a supercapacitor were examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge and discharge analysis (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and cycle life measurements in 2 M KOH electrolyte. The GCD analysis exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 2329.68 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a good rate capability (1330 F g−1 at 70 A g−1). Moreover, this approach also offers an exceptionally high area-normalized capacitance of 4.66 F cm−2. This capacitor electrode has excellent cyclic stability with 91.4% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles at 20 A g−1, together with 99.2% Coulomb efficiency in a three-electrode system. The superior electrochemical performance of the Cu2SnO4 NPs/NF composites is attributed to the synergistic effects of the hierarchical porosity, Cu2SnO4 NPs, and 3D nickel foam network structure, which can effectively accommodate the huge volume change of the Cu2SnO4 nanoparticles during cycling and maintain perfect electrical conductivity throughout the electrode. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) based on the as-obtained Cu2SnO4 NPs cathode and activated carbon (AC) anode displayed an excellent electrochemical behavior with a high energy density of 91.04 W h kg−1 at 4.35 kW kg−1 and superior cyclic stability. It also shows a small leakage current. Furthermore, the SC device retains 1.1 V of its initial voltage (1.4 V) after the 8 h self-discharge test, which suggests the good state of health of the SC device. These results demonstrate that Cu2SnO4 NPs could be a promising electrode for high-performance energy storage devices.
1. Introduction
In recent years, electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems1–4 have attracted more and more attention due to the ever-growing demand of modern society for multifarious renewable and high-efficiency energy storage in the current electronic industry, state of fossil fuel depletion, and following that environmental pollution problems.5,6 Among these devices, supercapacitors (SCs) have become particularly interesting due to their superior properties including excellent security, high power density, quick charge–discharge rate, better cycling lifespan, and environmental friendliness.7,8 Meanwhile, SCs, as state-of-the-art devices, have been used in many fields such as in hybrid electric vehicles, high-power laser devices, digital telecommunication systems, and smart electricity grid devices, etc.9–12 According to the charge storage principle, supercapacitors can be categorized into electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors or hybrid SCs.13 In EDLC's energy storage will be obtained mainly from the reversible ion absorption (non-Faradaic current) at the electrolyte/electrode interface,14 while pseudocapacitors store charges based on Faradaic reaction at the nanoscale gap of the surface.15 Generally, pseudocapacitors can provide a much higher specific capacitance and energy density due to their fast and reversible redox reactions.16–18
The electrochemical performance of supercapacitors primarily depends on the properties of the electrode materials. Therefore, it is rather urgent to explore and find suitable Faradaic electrode materials with excellent electrochemical performance. For the development of such high-performance pseudocapacitors normally three major types of electrode materials are used including carbon,19–21 metal oxides,22–30 and conducting polymers.31–35
Among different electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors, many transition-metal oxides (MTMOs), including stannates, ferrites, cobaltates, and nickelates, have been used as electroactive materials in high-performance supercapacitors. For example, ternary transition metal stannates, including Co2SnO4,36–38 Zn2SnO4,39 Mg2SnO4,40 and Mn2SnO441 have received great interest due to their low cost, environmental friendliness and high performance in many energy storage applications such as Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors. They can increase the electrochemical performances synergistically in terms of reversible capacity, fast electrode kinetics, high structural stability, electrical conductivity and favorable electroactive surface/interface between the electrode and electrolyte. It is also expected that binary metal oxides may provide more redox reactions originating from both metal oxide cations, as compared to the corresponding individual metal oxide. To date, various metal oxide stannate nanoparticles have shown excellent electrical, optical and magnetic properties and have widely been used in Li-ion batteries, antibacterial studies, photocatalysts, solar cells and supercapacitors. Owing to several specific novelties and advantages, the unique nanoarray structures have been extensively studied as a potential electrode material for batteries, supercapacitors, catalysis, and so on.42–45 Recently, among various nanostructures, researchers have focused on the alternative supercapacitor of non-toxic and less expensive metal oxide stannates nanoparticles. As per our knowledge the direct growth of Cu2SnO4 nanoparticles on conductive substrates has not been reported at all; hence, in this study, for the first time, we present a convenient method for synthesizing homogeneous nanoparticles in a low-temperature reaction, with low expensive, ambient conditions, and high purity to engineer Cu2SnO4 nanoparticles grown on desirable 3D Ni foam as an efficient binder-free electrode for high-performance electrochemical capacitors.
On the other hand, self-discharge and leakage current are the vital parameters, which determine the state of health of the supercapacitor device, that need to be further examined. Self-discharge is a spontaneous voltage drop in the electrochemical devices from a charged state when not connected with any load. Self-discharge is a major obstacle in the development of supercapacitors. The study of self-discharge of supercapacitors has great significance in practical scenarios as it determines the available energy for stand-alone applications. However, the self-discharge characteristics of supercapacitors remain unexplored to a great extent. The self-discharge characteristics describe the good health of SC devices and furthermore provide deep insight into two major self-discharge mechanisms as the (a) diffusion process and (b) leakage current through internal resistance.46 Moreover, the leakage current could be particularly detrimental in a miniaturized self-powered system, where the SC requires a very low charging current in the μA or even nA range. Furthermore, a high leakage current will lead to an extremely long charging time; in fact, it might even prevent the SC from charging completely. When the SC is used in combination with a battery, self-discharge of the SC will force the battery to continuously feed charge into the SC to keep it fully charged, in turn requiring frequent recharging of the battery, and thus reducing battery lifetime. Therefore, understanding the mechanism behind the phenomenon of self-discharge and leakage current, and how it can be suppressed, is highly essential for practical applications of SCs.
Bearing in mind the discussion above, herein, we have successfully fabricated Cu2SnO4 nanostructures on Ni foam through a simple hydrothermal approach. The prepared nanostructure was examined using various analytical studies and electrochemical activities such as CV, GCD, and EIS. Impressively, the as-prepared Cu2SnO4 nanoparticles deliver an ultrahigh specific capacity of 2329.68 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and 91.4% of the initial capacitance after 3000 cycles, together with 99.2% Coulomb efficiency, suggesting the great application potential of this material in supercapacitors. Simultaneously, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) composed of a Cu2SnO4 nanoparticle positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) negative electrode exhibits an excellent capacitive performance including high specific capacitance, rate capability, desirable cycling stability, and low self-discharge and leakage current. These excellent performances indicate that Cu2SnO4 NPs could be ideal electrode materials in the development of energy storage systems.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All the reagents were purchased from Merck chemicals (99% pure) and used without any further purification. All the aqueous solutions used in these experiments were prepared with deionized (DI) water (18.2 MΩ cm, Elga DI water system).
2.2. Hydrothermal assisted synthesis of Cu2SnO4 NPs

Scheme 1 illustrates the preparation process of Cu2SnO4 NPs/NF. The Cu2SnO4 NP arrays were successfully prepared using a facile hydrothermal method. Briefly, aqueous solutions of 50 mL containing 0.05 mol L−1 of CuCl2·2H2O and 0.025 mol L−1 of SnCl4·5H2O were dissolved using deionized water separately to form two transparent solutions. An appropriate amount of 3 mol L−1 of NaOH solution was added to the suspension solution dropwise to adjust the pH level to ∼10 under constant stirring. The suspension suddenly produced a green color precipitate which indicated the formation of a copper stannate colloidal suspension. A piece of the pre-treated nickel foam (approximately 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm), which was cleaned sequentially with 2 mol L−1 HCl solution, DI, and ethanol under sonication for 15 minutes each step, was then partially immersed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave containing the reaction solution. Afterward, the autoclave was capped tightly and heated at 180 °C for 12 h in an electronic oven, and naturally cooled down to room temperature spontaneously. After the hydrothermal reaction, the coated Ni foam was taken out and washed with distilled water and ethanol to remove surface ions and molecules, and then dried at 60 °C overnight. Finally, the coated substrate was calcinated at 550 °C in the air for 3 h with a ramping rate of 3 °C min−1 to transform into Cu2SnO4 NPs. The mass loading of the active materials was obtained by comparing the weight of the Ni foam before the hydrothermal reaction and after the calcination, which was determined at around 2 mg cm−2.

A possible mechanism for the formation of Cu2SnO4 NPs may occur as follows:12,47 Sn4+ + 6OH− → Sn(OH)62−(1) Cu2+ + 2OH− → Cu(OH)2(2) (3) (4)
2.3. Characterization
The morphology and structure of the synthesized samples were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Mira3 XMU from TESCAN Company), transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2010), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer. X-Ray diffraction analysis (XRD, X’Pert Pro from PANalytical Company) equipped with CuKα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm, at 40 kV and 40 mA) was employed to determine the crystalline structure of the synthesized products. The structure of the nanosheets was investigated using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR; Shimadzu 8900, Kyoto, Japan).
2.4. Electrochemical assessments
The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared hybrid electrodes were studied on a μAutolab PGSTAT30 electrochemical analyzer (Ecochemie BV, Utrecht, the Netherlands) controlled by Nova 2.1 software, using a conventional three-electrode cell configuration with an electrolyte solution of 2 mol L−1 KOH. The Ni foam coated with the Cu2SnO4 composite was used as the working electrode, and a platinum wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode (sat. KCl) were used as the auxiliary and reference electrodes, respectively. The working electrode for pure Cu2SnO4 was prepared by tape-casting a slurry of 70 wt% active material Cu2SnO4, 20 wt% conductive carbon black and 10 wt% Nafion binder onto a glassy carbon electrode, which was then dried at room temperature for 12 h. The cyclic voltammetry tests were conducted in the voltage window of −0.3 to 0.85 V at different scan rates. The galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were carried out at different current densities within a potential range of −0.2 to 0.42 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was recorded at an open-circuit voltage with 0.17 V amplitude within a frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz in 2 mol L−1 KOH. In the real applications, area-normalized capacitance values (F cm−2) are a better indicator of the performance of a supercapacitor, although gravimetric capacitance values (F g−1) have always been used in the literature for comparison of the performance for supercapacitors. The area-normalized capacitance values (F cm−2) were determined based on eqn (5). (5)where Cp is the specific capacitance (F cm−2), I is the discharge current in ampere, t the discharge time in seconds responding to a potential difference of ΔV in volt, and a is the active geometrical area of the electrode in cm2. The energy density (E) and power density (P) of the electrodes were calculated from the following equations:43 (6) (7)where E is the energy density (W h kg−1), Csp is the specific capacitance (F g−1), ΔV is the potential range (V), P is the power density (W kg−1) and Δt is the discharge time (s).
2.5. Fabrication of the Cu2SnO4//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC)
To fabricate the asymmetric supercapacitor, a Cu2SnO4/NF electrode was used as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) composite acted as the negative electrode. The negative electrode was fabricated by mixing 80 wt% activated carbon, 10 wt% carbon black as a conductive agent, and 10 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as a binder in an agate mortar using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidine (NMP) as a solvent to form a slurry. The slurry was uniformly pasted onto 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm nickel foam substrate and dried at 60 °C overnight.
To assemble the cell, the negative and positive electrodes were placed face to face into a container in which 2 mol L−1 KOH was added as the electrolyte. The mass of AC was calculated by the eq. (8), in which s+, and Csp represented the parameters of the cathode, and m−, ΔV– and C− were indicated the parameters of anode:48 (8)
Moreover, for the calculation of the energy density and power density of the ASC device, the results were obtained by using eqn (6) and (7).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the Cu2SnO4 nanostructure
The morphology of the prepared samples and pristine Ni foam was studied using electron microscopy. Briefly, due to the relatively high macroporosity, excellent electron conductivity, and low cost, commercial Ni foam was chosen as the substrate for engineering uniform Cu2SnO4 NPs precursors via a hydrothermal technique. The morphology of the prepared samples and pristine Ni foam was studied using electron microscopy. FESEM images of the Ni foam framework at low and high magnification (Fig. 1a) show that Ni foam has a nice three-dimensional space structure with an approximately plain surface, which can provide swift and efficacious pathways to increase the contact area between the electrolyte and the active material and also provide more surface area to allow more active materials to grow on it. After the blank Ni foam underwent a hydrothermal growth of Cu2SnO4 NPs, its surface was uniformly covered with well-aligned Cu2SnO4 NPs (Fig. 1b). The low- and high magnification FESEM images in Fig. 1b disclose that Cu2SnO4 NPs have a spherical morphology and tend to aggregate into larger clusters with granular structures.

To probe the stability of the electrode, the FESEM characterization of the Cu2SnO4 NPs was implemented after the electrochemical performance. It can be seen clearly from Fig. 1c that the hierarchical structures of the electrode are well-preserved, which are still in globular morphology. As no considerable changes can be found on the electrode before and after the cycling measurements, it proves the excellent stability of the electrode.
To further verify and explore the interior structure of the as-synthesized samples, TEM analysis was conducted. The image in Fig. 1d shows that the Cu2SnO4 NP clusters are also highly porous, which is fruitful for the mass transport of electrolyte during the charging/discharging. Remarkably, Cu2SnO4 NPs were densely distributed on Ni foam at very high coverage without aggregation.
The crystallographic structure and purity of the products were investigated by XRD. Fig. 2 depicts the XRD patterns of the as-prepared Cu2SnO4 NPs. The XRD pattern of the sample exhibits a series of diffraction peaks at 33.6, 36.4, 41.8, 48.2, 55.0, 55.3, 59.6, 68.7 and 77.9° indexed to the (110), (111), (101), (111), (200), (202), (202), (211), (221), (113), (310), (301), (311) and (004) which match well with the crystal planes of CuO (JCPDS No. 48-1548) and SnO2 (JCPDS No. 41-1445), respectively.49,50 This indicates that the pristine Cu2SnO4 NPs are well-matched with the standard patterns and the absence of any other peaks indicates the purity of the products.

To verify the existence and distribution of the elements on the as-prepared nanostructure, EDX mapping of Cu2SnO4 NPs has been conducted (Fig. 3). The corresponding spectrum (Fig. 3a) reveals that elements of Cu, Sn, and O were clearly presented and uniformly distributed in the whole structure, and no other element was present in the synthesized material. The tabulated results provide further evidence for the fine composition of the samples in the inspection field in units of weight percent as shown in Fig. 3a (inset).

The elemental mapping analysis was used to observe the homogeneously present elements from the prepared Cu2SnO4 NPs. They are uniformly distributed within the nanoparticle according to the SEM image and EDX elemental maps (Fig. 3b–e).
FT-IR spectroscopy was carried out to obtain the chemical structure/functionalities present in the as-prepared Cu2SnO4 NPs, as shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, the broad and weak absorption peak observed in the range of 3458.70 and 1000–1600 cm−1 belongs to the stretching and bending vibration of OH groups of lattice water, which can act as the adsorption sites for the metal ions. The absorption band at 844.66 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the Sn–O bond51 and the absorption peak situated at 504.42 cm−1 can be attributed to the asymmetric vibration of the Cu–O bond.52,53 The FT-IR spectrum of the Cu2SnO4 NPs show identical peaks, confirming the successful synthesis.

To ascertain the specific surface area and the porosity characteristic, nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis was performed at 77 K. Fig. 5 shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm and the corresponding average pore size distribution (inset in Fig. 5) for the as-prepared Cu2SnO4 NPs. From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the sample shows the typical IV isotherms and possesses abundant mesopores and the average size is 22.46 nm.

Remarkably, based on the results of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), the specific surface area and total pore volume were obtained to be 14.35 m2 g−1 and 0.021 cm3 g−1. Additionally, the mesoporous structure of the samples was further confirmed using the BJH method (inset of Fig. 5). The high specific surface area could provide more effective active sites for chemical reactions.54,55
3.2. The electrochemical performance of Cu2SnO4/NF in a three-electrode system
To demonstrate the electrochemical performance of the prepared active material as the electrode for supercapacitor devices and better explore the potential applications in electrochemical capacitors, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (CDG) measurements were conducted using a three-electrode system, comprising platinum as the counter electrode, saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and the active material as the working electrode using 2 mol L−1 KOH as an aqueous electrolyte solution. Fig. 6a shows the typical CV curves of net-like Ni foam and Cu2SnO4 NPs/NF electrodes at 50 mV s−1 in the potential range of −0.30.85 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). It can be seen that the surrounded area illustrated under the voltammogram of the Cu2SnO4 NPs was higher than that of the bare Ni foam. In general, the area of a voltammogram is proportional to the specific capacitance of the electrode material.56Fig. 6b displays the CV curves of the Cu2SnO4 NPs/NF electrode at various sweep rates ranging from 5 to 200 mV s−1. Obviously, it can be seen that with the increase of scanning speed, the anodic and cathodic peaks continuously shift to more positive and negative potentials respectively, which suggests the great rate capability of electronic and ionic transportation at the interface of the electroactive material/electrolyte.5,12 The observed redox peak is due to the charge-transfer kinetics of Cu2+/Cu3+ in the metal tin. The CV curve consists of a pair of well-defined redox peaks, attributing to the interaction between Cu2SnO4 and electrolyte ion, which can be defined by the following equations: Cu2SnO4 + OH− + H2O ↔ SnOOH + 2CuOOH + e−(9) CuOOH + OH− ↔ CuO + H2O + e−(10) SnOOH + OH− ↔ SnO2 + H2O + e−(11)

The GCD is a dependable method to evaluate the superior electrochemical performance of the Cu2SnO4 NP electrode materials on Ni foam. Therefore the capacitance for Cu2SnO4 NPs was estimated using the GCD technique, and the GCD curves are shown in Fig. 6c and d. Fig. 6c shows the GCD curves of the pristine Ni foam electrode and Cu2SnO4 NPs grown on Ni foam at the current density of 1 A g−1. To estimate the capacitance of the bare Ni-foam substrate, we have investigated the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curves of bare Ni-foam compared to the Cu2SnO4/NF electrode. As shown in Fig. 6c, the Cu2SnO4 NPs/NF electrode delivered a much longer discharging time than the pristine Ni foam electrode, which is indicative of its higher specific capacitance and can be related to the Cu2SnO4 NP electrode nanostructures.

Fig. 6d exhibits the GCD curves of the Cu2SnO4 NP electrode measured at a constant potential range between −0.2 and 0.42 V within current densities varying from 1 to 70 A g−1. The nonlinear charge–discharge profiles further support the pseudocapacitive characteristics of the electrode, which is in good agreement with the CV results. Due to eqn (5) and using the discharge data, the specific capacitance as a function of current densities was calculated and the as-obtained results were plotted in Fig. 6d. Evidently, the Cu2SnO4 NP electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2329.68 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, which corresponds to the area-normalized capacitance of 4.66 F cm−2. This value of area-normalized capacitance is normalized by the geometric area of the electrode.
Significantly, even at a higher current density, the Cu2SnO4 NPs maintain about 57.08% of their initial capacitance, which indicates that the Cu2SnO4 NPs have excellent rate capability (Fig. 6e). More remarkably, the specific capacitance of the Cu2SnO4 NPs is greater than those of the electrodes based on other transition metal stannates recently reported, such as Mn2SnO4 nanocubes (144 F g−1 at 3 mA cm−2),12 Co2SnO4/activated carbon composite electrodes (285.3 F g−1 at 5 mA cm−2),36 Co2SnO4 nanocubes (237 F g−1 at 0.5 mA cm−2),37 Co2SnO4 nanoparticles (596 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1),38 Mn2SnO4/Sn/C composites (908 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1),41 and Zn2SnO4 (1384 mA h g−1).57
Another important requirement for the electrochemical efficiency of electrode materials is the cycling capability or cycling life and Coulomb efficiency. The cycling life tests over 3000 cycles for the Cu2SnO4 NPs/NF electrode at a current density of 20 A g−1 were carried out using constant current galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling techniques in the potential windows ranging from −0.2 to 0.42 V (Fig. 6f). As can be seen, the as-prepared electrode showed only 8.6% loss in the specific capacitance after 3000 charge–discharge cycles, and the Coulomb efficiency is 99.2%, which illustrates the excellent long-term cyclability of the composite electrode and it can be used as a novel high-performance supercapacitor. The outstanding cycling stability and Coulomb efficiency should be attributed to the good rigidity and connectivity of the ridge, straight-pore, and nano-grid architecture.
The Cu2SnO4 NPs/NF hybrid was compared with a traditional coating electrode with pure Cu2SnO4 NPs. The CV curves in Fig. 7a indicate that the supercapacitor with the Cu2SnO4 NP electrode displays better capacitance behavior in the window from −0.35 to 0.35 V. Nevertheless, the area of the CV graph is much smaller than those of the Cu2SnO4 NPs/NF hybrid. The GCD profiles were further tested from 1 to 20 A g−1 in Fig. 7b, and the interesting results reveal that the discharge capacity and rate performance of the Cu2SnO4 NPs/NF hybrid without binder is better than those of pure Cu2SnO4 NPs because of the direct contact between the conductive Ni foam and Cu2SnO4 NPs, avoiding the assistance of a conductive agent, significantly decreasing the “dead zone” of the electrodes.58–60
 Fig. 7  (a) The CV curves of the pure Cu2SnO4 NPs at various sweep rates in 2 mol L−1 KOH; (b) the GCD curves of the pure Cu2SnO4 NPs at different current densities; (c) geometric specific capacitance of the pure Cu2SnO4 NPs at different current densities; (d) cycling properties of the pure Cu2SnO4 NP electrode at a current density of 8 A g−1 for 3000 cycles. 

Fig. 7c shows the specific capacitance in various current densities for the pure Cu2SnO4 NPs. As can be seen, the proposed electrochemical capacitor can deliver a remarkable specific capacitance with 24.50% preservation after a 20-times increase in current density. The decrease in capacitance was attributed to the presence of the inner active sites, which could not sustain the redox transitions completely at faster scan rates. Notably, the results showed that after 3000 continuous cycles, the pure Cu2SnO4 NPs maintained 77.9% of their initial value (Fig. 7d).
To investigate the charge transfer and the electrolyte diffusion at the contact space between the electrolyte and electroactive materials, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were also accomplished at an open circuit potential (OCP) over the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz in 2 mol L−1 KOH aqueous solution with an amplitude of 0.328 mV. Fig. 8 compares the Nyquist plots of the EIS spectra for the pristine Ni foam and Cu2SnO4 NPs/NF electrodes. Obviously, the Nyquist impedance plots are composed of an imperfect semicircle at the high-frequency region and a vertical straight line at the low-frequency region. The diameter of the semicircle at a high frequency corresponds to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrode, which is related to the diffusion of charge in the electrode/electrolyte interface. The vertical line at lower frequencies is dependent on the ion diffusion/transport of the electrolyte into the pores of the electrodes. As can be seen in Fig.8a, the negligible semicircle observed for the Cu2SnO4 electrode in the high-frequency region suggests a much faster charge transfer for it, confirming the better electrochemical performance of the Cu2SnO4 electrode. Obviously, due to the low slope of the straight line, the unmodified Ni foam electrode reveals higher diffusive resistance than the Cu2SnO4 electrode in the low-frequency region, which confirms the diffusion and transportation of the electrolyte ions into the electrode materials.61Fig. 8b shows the Nyquist plots for the Cu2SnO4 NP electrode before and after 3000 cycles. The charge transfer resistance was slightly increased from 9.83 Ω to 15.93 Ω, which indicates that the specific capacitance was decreased after a long-term cycling test. In addition, in the low-frequency region, the Cu2SnO4 NP electrode before the cycles shows a more vertical line than the Cu2SnO4 NP electrode after the cycles, demonstrating a lower mass transfer resistance (Warburg).

3.3. Electrochemical performance of the Cu2SnO4 NPs//AC asymmetric device (ASC)
To explore the practicality of the as-synthesized electrode, a rechargeable hybrid ASC was constructed with a two-electrode configuration, in which the Cu2SnO4 NPs and activated carbon (AC) were employed as the cathode and the anode respectively. Each electrode had a geometric surface area of 0.5 cm2 and was immersed into an aqueous solution of 2 mol L−1 KOH as the electrolyte. The schematic of the device is shown in Fig. 9a. To find the optimal working potential, before fabricating the two-electrode system, the CV curves were investigated for both electrodes at a constant scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in the 2 mol L−1 KOH electrolyte in a separate three-electrode cell (Fig. 9b). Due to the mentioned figure, the as-prepared Cu2SnO4 NP electrode has two separate redox peaks in the range of −0.3–0.85 V in the potential window due to the specification of the pseudocapacitive capacitor. In addition, the negative electrode has no redox peak in the potential range of −1.0–0.0 V, displaying its typical EDLC behavior.62 According to the potential window of the cathode and anode, the maximum stable potential window of the ASC could be extended to 1.85 V (Fig. 9b). Fig. 9c shows the CV curves with various potential windows of the Cu2SnO4 NPs//AC hybrid supercapacitor at 50 mV s−1. Therefore, a maximum working voltage of 1.4 V was selected for the asymmetric supercapacitor cell. Fig. 9d displays the CV performance of the device at various sweep rates from 5 to 200 mV s−1 within the potential range of 0.0–1.6 V. The obvious redox peaks in the CV curves result from the electrochemical reactions of the Cu2SnO4 NPs electrode. Fig. 9e shows the GCD curves of the ASC device at different current densities from 1 to 6 A g−1 with the voltage window of −0.5 to 1.4 V as well. As can be seen from Fig. 9e, at a low current density, slightly linear behavior was observed, along with a long discharging time, demonstrating that all the active sites contributed to the charge storage. By considering the discharge time and the total mass of the positive and negative electrodes, the device exhibits a specific capacitance of 181 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, demonstrating an excellent storage capability for the ASC device.

As shown in Fig. 9f, a cycling test has been implemented for 3000 cycles at 5 A g−1 to assess the cycling stability of ASC, and the corresponding GCD curves of ASC at the 1st and 3000th cycle are presented in the inset of Fig. 9f. The capacitance still remains about 92.4% after 3000 cycles, which suggests an excellent rate capability of the device which is high compared to previously reported transition metals stannates and other binary metal oxides supercapacitor devices such as Mn2SnO4//Mn2SnO4 (75% after 1000 cycles),12 Co2SnO4//AC (70.6% after 1000 cycles),36 MFO-NSAs//AC (87.3% after 3000 cycles),43 FeO4W/f-MWCNTs symmetric supercapacitor (78.54% after 10000 cycles),63 and PCNF//AC (92% after 800 cycles at 2 A g−1).64
SCs like other energy storage devices experience self-discharge in the charged state owing to the thermodynamic driving force that has a higher free energy in the charged states compared to the discharged states.65 Self-discharge is averted by the use of redox couples that are transformed to insoluble species via electrolysis and adsorbed onto the activated carbon electrode in redox-couple EDLCs, thus transforming the bulk weight of the normal EDLC electrolyte to a lively constituent for charge retention. The self-discharge behavior of the Cu2SnO4//AC ASC was investigated by testing the open-circuit voltage change after fully charging the devices to 1.4 V at 1 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 10a, these ASCs exhibit fast self-discharge courses in the first 1 h, and then a reduction in self-discharge rate. After 8 h, the voltages of the ASCs descend to 1.1 V, which indicates the low self-discharge of the Cu2SnO4//AC ASC.
 Fig. 10  (a) Self-discharge properties of the asymmetric Cu2SnO4 NPs//AC ACS; (b) leakage currents of the asymmetrical Cu2SnO4 NPs//AC ACS at different voltages over time. 
Leakage current is another important indicator for measuring or predicting the lost energy of SCs. In this study, the leakage current was recorded during a 1 h potentiostat holding after the devices were galvanostatically charged to the desired voltages. Fig. 10b shows the time-dependent leakage current of the Cu2SnO4//AC ASC at different voltages (0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4 V).
In Fig. 11, the Ragone plot of the evaluated specific energy and specific power at different current densities was indicated. The specific energy density (E) and power density (P) were calculated according to eqn (2) and (3), respectively.66 The maximum energy density of 91.04 W h kg−1 was attained at a power density of 4.35 kW kg−1. These measured data for the Cu2SnO4//AC asymmetrical device are higher than the previously reported data for symmetrical and asymmetrical devices, such as the Mn2SnO4//Mn2SnO4 symmetrical device (30.4 W h kg−1 at 1.58 kW kg−1),12 MnMoS4//AC (58.03 W h kg−1 at 770 W kg−1),14 MCS/GNF//AC (14.33 W h kg−1 at 74.87 W kg−1),67 CuCo2O4/MnCo2O4 (42.1 W h kg−1 at 400 W kg−1),68 and H2Ti11.85Nb0.15O25//AC (24.3 W h kg−1 at 5.8 kW kg−1).69 Based on the high energy and power delivering ability and the good cyclability, the Cu2SnO4//AC ASC herein could serve as an efficient and long lifetime energy storage device (Table 1).

Conclusions
In a nutshell, a novel electrode of Cu2SnO4 NPs for high-performance supercapacitors was fabricated using a facile hydrothermal process. The supercapacitor electrode showed an excellent electrochemical capacitor performance with an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2329.68 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density, which corresponds to the area-normalized capacitance of 4.66 F cm−2 in the 2 mol L−1 KOH electrolyte as well as markedly exceptional cyclic stability with a capacitance retention of 91.40% after 3000 cycles due to the good electrical conductivity and highly exposed surface areas with high Coulomb efficiency (99.2%). In addition, the successfully fabricated symmetrical Cu2SnO4 NPs//AC device delivers a high energy density of 91.04 W h kg−1 at a power density of 4.35 kW kg−1. The asymmetric supercapacitor also displays excellent rate capability and cycling stability. The capacitance is maintained around 92.39% after 3000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. The asymmetrical supercapacitor also displays an excellent rate capability, low self-discharge and leakage current. The discovery of such supercapacitor electrodes definitely opens up a new avenue for high-performance renewable energy storage devices in the future.
