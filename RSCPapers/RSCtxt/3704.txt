    , Accepted 6th March 2007First published on 3rd April 2007AbstractThe fullerene end-capped platinum acetylide donor–acceptor triad Pt2ThC60 was synthesized and characterized by using photophysical methods and photovoltaic device testing. The triad consists of the platinum acetylide oligomer Ph––Pt(PBu3)2––Th––Pt(PBu3)2––Ph (Ph = phenyl and Th = 2,5-thienyl, stereochemistry at both Pt centers is trans) that contains fulleropyrrolidine moieties on each of the terminal phenylene units. Electrochemistry of the triad reveals relatively low potential oxidation and reduction waves corresponding, respectively, to oxidation of the platinum acetylide and reduction of the fulleropyrrolidine units. Photoluminescence spectroscopy shows that the singlet and triplet states of the platinum acetylide chromophore are strongly quenched in the triad assembly, both in solution at ambient temperature as well as in a low-temperature solvent glass. The excited state quenching arises due to intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer to produce a charge separated state based on charge transfer from the platinum acetylide (donor) to the fulleropyrrolidine (acceptor). Picosecond time resolved absorption spectroscopy confirms that the charge transfer state is produced within 1 ps of photoexcitation, and it decays by charge recombination within 400 ps. Organic photovoltaic devices fabricated using spin-coated films of Pt2ThC60 as the active material operate with modest efficiency, exhibiting a short circuit photocurrent of 0.51 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.41 V under 100 mW cm−2/AM1.5 illumination. The results are discussed in terms of the relationship between the mechanism of photoinduced electron transfer in the triad and the comparatively efficient photovoltaic response exhibited by the material.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) based on conjugated polymers or oligomers have attracted considerable interest due to their potential as cost effective, light weight, flexible photovoltaic cells.1–6 The most common approach to fabrication of such OPVs is to blend conjugated organic materials with an electron acceptor to form a bulk-heterojunction in the active layer. Current state-of-the art bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells afford solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies approaching 5%.3–7 The initial step in carrier generation in bulk-heterojunction polymer photovoltaics involves photoinduced charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor to produce a charge separated state. Not surprisingly, the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer and charge separation play key roles in the overall performance of OPVs.6,8–10
While a variety of electron acceptors including organic molecules, polymers and inorganic nanocrystals have been used in OPVs,11–13 fullerenes and their derivatives have been the focus of most work due to their low reduction potentials,14,15 low reorganization energies associated with reduction,16 and their propensity to afford solid materials that feature high electron mobility.17–20 On the other hand, the poor solubility of fullerenes results in aggregate formation during the device fabrication process and this phenomenon can produce morphological defects that negatively affect the efficiency of the resulting devices. One approach to increasing the efficiency for photoinduced electron transfer and reducing the spatial separation of the donor and acceptor phases in bulk-heterojunction based OPVs is to use molecular dyads or triads in which a C60 moiety is covalently attached to an electron donor/chromophore. A number of reports have shown that such dyads and triads provide high photoinduced electron transfer efficiency in solution.21–28 It has also been shown that the distance, orientation, and the nature of the bridge separating the donor and the fullerene play important roles in the dynamics and efficiency of photoinduced charge transfer.21–28
Another important issue concerns the effect of electronic spin state on the dynamics and efficiency of charge recombination in charge separated states. Specifically, in bimolecular systems the efficiency for cage-escape of the geminate ion-pair produced by photoinduced charge transfer is enhanced significantly when the excited state is a spin-triplet.29–34 In donor–acceptor dyad systems the lifetime of the charge separated state is lengthened substantially when the excited state is a spin-triplet state compared to structurally analogous dyads in which a singlet excited state precedes charge separation.31–34
Recently, several groups, including our own, have initiated studies that have the objective of harnessing the triplet state to enhance the efficiency of photoinduced charge separation in OPVs. In one report, Yang and co-workers reported fabrication of OPVs based on platinum(II) octaethylporphyrin and C60 which operate with an overall power conversion efficiency of >1%.35 They postulate that the efficiencies of exciton diffusion to the donor–acceptor interface and charge separation are enhanced because a triplet excited state is produced rapidly and with very high yield following photoexcitation of the platinum–porphyrin chromophore. In an independent investigation our group demonstrated the fabrication of relatively efficient OPVs based on a bulk-heterojunction consisting of a platinum-acetylide polymer blended with 6,6-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).36 The relatively high PV efficiency was attributed to arise in part due to the involvement of the triplet excited state of the platinum-acetylide polymer, which is formed within 5 ps following light absorption by the material. Support that the triplet state is the precursor to the charge separated state was provided by photophysical studies carried out in solution, where it was shown that PCBM efficiently quenches the polymer’s phosphorescence, and more importantly, transient absorption which clearly showed that triplet quenching is accompanied by the production of high yields of the oxidized platinum acetylide and reduced PCBM.36
In order to provide additional information concerning the mechanism and dynamics of charge separation in platinum-acetylide/fullerene donor–acceptor materials, and their performance in OPVs, we have carried out an investigation of the donor–acceptor triad Pt2ThC60 (4, Scheme 1). This triad consists of a platinum-acetylide oligomer covalently linked to two C60 based acceptors. This triad was constructed in order to allow us to apply steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy to probe for the involvement of the singlet and/or triplet states of the platinum-acetylide chromophore in the charge separation step. In this manuscript we report the synthesis, structural characterization and photophysical study of triad Pt2ThC60, as well as the platinum-acetylide model compound Pt2Th (2, Scheme 1). The optical and electronic properties of these molecules were characterized by electrochemistry, steady-state absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as by time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. The photophysical results provide detailed insight concerning the mechanism and dynamics of photoinduced charge transfer in platinum-acetylide/fullerene donor–acceptor materials. In addition to the photophysical studies, photovoltaic devices were fabricated utilizing Pt2ThC60 as the active material. These novel devices operate with a maximum incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of 22% and an overall solar to electrical power conversion efficiency of 0.05%. These efficiencies rank among the highest yet reported for OPVs that are based on an active material that consists solely of a donor–acceptor dyad or triad assembly.

Experimental
General
All commercially available materials were used as received unless noted otherwise. Poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS, Baytron P VP Al 4083) was purchased from Bayer Corporation (PA, USA). 1,2-Dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) was distilled from calcium hydride under argon atmosphere. 4-Ethynylbenzadehyde37 and compound 138 were synthesized according to the literature procedures.

1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectra were recorded on either a Varian Gemini 300 or Mercury 300 spectrometer, and chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to TMS. Mass spectra were recorded on either a Finnigan MAT95Q Hybrid Sector (EI, HRMS) or a Bruker Reflex II (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed on a Bioanalytical Systems CW50 electrochemical analyzer at a sweep rate of 100 mV s−1 using a platinum disc working electrode, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode, and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Solutions of samples were prepared in o-DCB. The supporting electrolyte was 0.10 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6).

Photophysical measurements. 
Steady-state absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 100 dual-beam spectrophotometer. Corrected steady-state emission spectra were recorded on a SPEX-2 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Solutions were purged with argon for 20 min before each measurement. The photoluminescence quantum yields were determined using the relative actinometry method, in which [Ru(bpy)3]2+ in water (Φ = 0.055)39 was used as standard. Nanosecond time resolved absorption was measured by using a previously reported setup in a 2 mm path length cell in 1:1 benzonitrile/dichloromethane.40,41 Picosecond time resolved absorption experiments were carried out using methods and instrumentation that have been described in a previous publication.42 All experiments were conducted with excitation at 400 nm using the frequency doubled output of a Ti:sapphire laser.

Then the mixture was purged with N2 for 30 min and stirred at room temperature for 3 d. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure, and the crude residue was purified by column chromatography on silica (eluent:methylene chloride/hexane 1:1, then methane chloride) to give 1.12 g (43%) of compound 2. 1HNMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): 7.1 ∼ 7.3 (10H), 6.6 (s, 2H), 2.1 (m, 24H), 1.6 (m, 24H), 1.46 (m, 24H), 0.93 (m, 36H). 31PNMR (121 MHz, CDCl3): 4.42 (J = 2347). 13CNMR (75 MHz, CDCl3): 14.16, 23.98, 24.21, 24.44, 24.62, 24.71, 24.79, 26.66, 102.02, 108.13, 109.27, 113.39, 125.05, 127.07, 128.10, 129.33, 131.04.

Pt2ThC60 (4). 
C60 (1.0 g, 1.39 mmol) was dissolved in 255 mL of chlorobenzene and the solution was purged with argon for 30 min. Then compound 3 (1.0 g, 0.63 mmol) and N-methylglycine (361 mg, 4.06 mmol) were added to the solution. The resulting solution was refluxed for 20 h in the dark. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica. Unreacted C60 was removed by eluting with a hexane/toluene (3:1) mixture.

Photovoltaic device fabrication and characterization. 
Solar cells were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) covered glass substrates (Delta Technologies, Rs = 8–12 Ω square−1). The ITO/glass substrates were etched by exposure to aqua regia vapor and subsequently cleaned in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min with aqueous sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Fisher scientific), de-ionized water (Milli-Q), acetone, and isopropanol. The substrates were then treated with oxygen plasma for 15 min in a Plasma Cleaner (HARRICK PDC-32G). Aqueous PEDOT-PSS (Bayer Baytron P VP Al 4083) solution was spin coated at 4000 rpm onto the cleaned glass substrates and dried under vacuum for 2–4 h at 150 °C. The photoactive layer was then spin-coated and the resulting films were dried under vacuum for 2–3 d at room temperature. The thickness of the layer was measured using a Dektak 3030 (Veeco Instruments Inc.) profilometer. Lithium fluoride (LiF, 0.5 nm) and aluminum (Al, 200 nm) were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation on the photoactive layer. Finally an epoxy (Loctite quick set epoxy) layer was applied onto the metal electrode side of the device to protect it from oxygen and moisture. The active area of the devices was 0.25 cm2.
The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were measured with a Keithley SMU 2400 source measurement unit under the illumination of AM 1.5 with an incident power density of 100 mW cm−2 using a 150 W Xe arc lamp (Oriel instruments). The external quantum efficiency of the photovoltaic devices was evaluated by measuring the incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE, %). For IPCE measurements, device pixels were irradiated with monochromatic light through an ISA H20 monochromator with a 75 W Xe arc lamp as a light source. The intensity of the source at each wavelength was determined using an energy meter (S350, UDT Instruments, http://www.udtinstruments.com) equipped with a calibrated silicon detector (Model 221, UDT Instruments). The current response under short circuit conditions was then recorded for each pixel at 10 nm intervals using a Keithley 2400 SMU (positive lead to ITO and negative lead to aluminum). The IPCE spectral response curve was computed using the wavelength dependent source intensity and the measured short circuit currents. The current–voltage (I-V) curve and IPCE plots were measured for at least three pixels, and the data represent the average of the three measurements. In every case the errors in the measurements are <10% than the reported values.

Results
Synthesis
As shown in Scheme 1, the model compound Pt2Th (2) was obtained by a CuI-catalyzed coupling of compound 138 and ethynylbenzene under Hagihara conditions.43 Coupling of compound 1 with 4-ethynylbenzaldehyde under the same conditions afforded compound 3. Introduction of the fullerene moiety was accomplished via the Prato reaction,15,44 wherein compound 3 was treated with C60 in the presence of sarcosine to undergo a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to afford triad Pt2ThC60 (4). It is known that multiple additions to a single fullerene moiety can occur after 40∼50% of C60 is consumed.15 Therefore, it was necessary to stop the reaction when the reaction was incomplete to avoid formation of undesired byproducts resulting from multiple addition to C60. The model and triad complexes, Pt2Th and Pt2ThC60 were fully characterized by 1H, 13C, 31P NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry and the spectral data are provided as supporting information.† The spectral data are consistent with the structures, with one interesting feature. Specifically, the 31P NMR spectrum of Pt2PtC60 is split into a closely spaced doublet. This splitting arises because the compound exists as a mixture of diasteromers (d, l and meso) resulting from the two chiral carbons that are α to the amino nitrogens in the pyrrolidine rings.
Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammetry was carried out on Pt2PtC60 in order to characterize the accessible redox states and to provide information needed to compute the energy of the charge separated state (vide infra). The CV was performed in o-DCB solution with TBAPF6 as supporting electrolyte; the voltammogram is shown in Fig. 1 and the half-wave potentials are listed in Table 1. As seen in Fig. 1, four reversible redox processes were observed. First, on the anodic sweep there is a single, reversible oxidative wave at E1/2 = +0.83 V. This wave corresponds to a one-electron process and it is attributed to the oxidation of the platinum acetylide moiety. In a separate investigation, we have characterized the electrochemistry of a series of platinum acetylide oligomers that are structurally similar to Pt2Th.45 On the basis of this work it is clear that the anodic wave observed for Pt2ThC60 at +0.83 V can be assigned to oxidation of an electrophore consisting of the –[Pt(P)2–CC–Th–CC–Pt(P)2–] unit. The cathodic scan reveals three, reversible waves in the potential region from −0.5 to −1.6 V. These waves are due to reduction of the two fulleropyrrolidine units. Although the cathodic waves appear as if they correspond to two-electron processes (based on the relative peak current relative to the platinum acetylide anodic wave), they must result from two one-electron processes occurring simultaneously on each end-capping fulleropyrrolidine. Multiple reduction waves with C60 derivatives have previously been reported.15,22,24,46 The first reduction potential of the fullerene units in Pt2ThC60 (−0.62 V) agrees closely with the value reported for a model compound for the fulleropyrrolidine units (−0.68 V vs. SCE),47 which is consistent with the notion that there is only weak electronic coupling between the C60 and the platinum-acetylide units in the triad assembly.

Absorption and emission spectrosocopy
The absorption and photoluminescence spectra of Pt2Th and Pt2ThC60 are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2 lists pertinent photophysical data for the two complexes. First, the absorption spectrum of the model complex (Pt2Th, Fig. 2a) is dominated by a moderately intense band in the near-UV region (λmax
					≈ 385 nm) which is due to the π,π* transitions of the platinum-acetylide chromophore. This band is similar in energy and oscillator strength compared to other platinum-acetylide oligomers and polymers that have been previously studied. The photoluminescence of the model (Fig. 2b, obtained in argon degassed solution) features a weak band in the 400–500 nm region, along with a much more intense band with λmax = 609 nm). The weak emission in the blue region is fluorescence, whereas the more intense red-emission is phosphorescence from the triplet state of the platinum-acetylide chromophore. The phosphorescence is much stronger compared to the fluorescence because intersystem crossing is very rapid and efficient (vide infra) due to the heavy atom effect of the platinum(II) centers.

As shown in Fig. 2a, the absorption spectrum of Pt2ThC60 appears to be a linear sum of the spectra of Pt2Th and two C60 moieties. In particular, the spectrum is dominated by bands at λ = 257 and 328 nm which arise from the C60 units. The π,π* transition of the platinum-acetylide chromophore appears as a shoulder in the near-UV region. Interestingly, the absorption of Pt2ThC60 features a weak, clearly defined band at λmax = 429 nm along with a “tail” extending well into the visible region. These latter features are also very characteristic of the fullerene chromophore. Although the model compound exhibits comparatively strong red phosphorescence, Pt2ThC60 is virtually non-photoluminescent (Fig. 2b). In particular, only very weak (ϕ < 10−4) fluorescence is observed from the platinum-acetylide chromophore (400–500 nm), along with weak fluorescence from the fulleropyrrolidine units at 717 nm. The fact that the phosphorescence from Pt2ThC60 is very weak signals that the triplet excited state of platinum acetylide is efficiently quenched, presumably via photoinduced electron transfer to C60, i.e. (1)In order to explore whether the electron transfer quenching process remains active at low temperatures, the emission of Pt2ThC60 was measured at 80 K in a 2-methyltetrahydrofuran glass. Interestingly, the emission remains very weak in the low temperature glass, which signals that photoinduced electron transfer still occurs. The fact that electron transfer quenching (eqn (1)) is still active in the glass is consistent with the process being strongly exothermic (e.g., ΔG < −0.5 eV).48,49 As detailed below, calculations based on the photophysical and electrochemical data indicate that photoinduced electron transfer is exothermic by more than 0.6 eV.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
In order to provide direct evidence for the photoinduced charge transfer, nanosecond laser flash photolysis experiments were carried out on solutions of the model complex Pt2Th (c = 0.3 mM) in the presence of C60 (c = 0.1 mM) in a dichloromethane/benzonitrile solvent mixture (1:1 v:v). The absorption-difference spectra obtained at various delay times following 355 nm excitation are shown in Fig. 3.36 At 100 ns delay after excitation, the transient absorption spectrum is dominated by a band at 610 nm that arises from the triplet excited state of the platinum-acetylide chromophore, 3Pt2Th*. At longer delay times this band decays and is replaced by a weak visible absorption with λmax
					≈ 520 nm along with a new band that appears in near-IR region at λmax
					≈ 1050 nm. Kinetic traces (not displayed) show that the rise of the 1050 nm absorption coincides with the decay of 3Pt2Th* absorption at 600 nm. The near-IR absorption is due to the reduced fullerene, C60˙−,50 and the weak visible absorption is attributed to the oxidized platinum-acetylide unit, Pt2Th+˙.45 In order to highlight the spectral features of the oxidized platinum-acetylide chromophore (Pt2Th+˙), the inset in Fig. 3 is a magnification of the visible region of the transient absorption spectrum at 1.9 μs delay time. It is evident that the spectrum of this radical cation features a broad absorption band with a maximum at 520 nm and then a “sloping” shoulder that extends to ≈600 nm. Taken together, the nanosecond transient absorption results indicate that the triplet excited state of Pt2Th is quenched by C60via photoinduced electron transfer to afford the charge separated ions, (2)Ultrafast transient absorption experiments were carried out in order to investigate the mechanism of intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer in the triad, Pt2ThC60. Initially, studies were conducted on the model complex, Pt2Th, in order to provide information concerning the spectral changes that occur on the fs–ps timescale after excitation of the platinum-acetylide chromophore. As shown in Fig. 4a, the early time difference absorption spectrum of Pt2Th is dominated by a band with λmax
					≈ 650 nm that arises within the instrument time response function. Within several ps the initial absorption evolves into a band with λmax
					≈ 609 nm. This latter absorption band is the same spectrum as observed in early time nanosecond transient absorption experiment, which is attributed to the triplet state, 3Pt2Th*. Given this, it is likely then that the initial spectrum (650 nm) is that of the singlet state, 1Pt2Th*, and the spectral changes that occur over the first few ps following excitation is due to singlet–triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) and vibrational relaxation of the triplet state. Analysis of the decay of the singlet transient absorption at 677 nm affords the singlet lifetime τ
					≈ 1 ps, which corresponds to an intersystem crossing rate of kISC
					≈ 1012 s−1. This intersystem crossing rate is consistent with previously reported ISC rates in platinum-acetylide oligomers.51
 Fig. 3  Transient absorption difference spectra of Pt2Th (0.3 mM) with C60 (0.1 mM) in a 1:1 mixture of dichloromethane and benzonitrile. Difference spectra were obtained at various delay times following 355 nm excitation (10 mJ per pulse). Delay times (listed in order of decreasing intensity in the visible region and increasing intensity in the near-infrared): 100 ns, 0.64 μs, 1.28 μs, 1.92 μs. The inset shows an expansion of the visible region of the spectrum at 1.92 μs delay. 
 Fig. 4  Picosecond transient absorption difference spectra of (a) Pt2Th (c = 0.3 mM) and (b) Pt2ThC60 in chloroform. Excitation wavelength 400 nm, delays after excitation shown in legend. 

Fig. 4b illustrates the picosecond time resolved absorption spectra of the triad, Pt2ThC60, following 400 nm excitation. The early time spectrum (ca. 1 ps delay) features a maximum at ca. 610 nm and a slight shoulder at ca. 510 nm. Within a few ps the 610 nm absorption decays, and the spectrum that is then observed (ca. 10 ps delay) exhibits broad absorption from 500–600 nm, with peaks at ca. 510 and 600 nm. Importantly, the 10 ps delay time spectrum is very similar in bandshape to the visible region nanosecond transient absorption assigned to the oxidized platinum-acetylide chromophore, Pt2Th+˙ (compare with Fig. 3 inset). (Note that it was not possible to monitor the transient absorption in the near-infrared in order to confirm the presence of the reduced fulleropyrrolidine moiety). This final spectrum is assigned to the charge separated state produced by photoinduced charge transfer, (3)Once produced, the charge separated state decays by charge-recombination; analysis of the decay of the final transient state affords a lifetime of 390 ps for the charge separated state, which implies that the rate of charge recombination is kCR
					≈ 2.6 × 109 s−1.
The picosecond transient absorption spectra of the triad provide unequivocal evidence that photoexcitation of the Pt2Th chromophore is followed by very rapid photoinduced electron transfer to afford the charge separated state. The data are consistent with a sequence of events involving: (i) initial excitation to produce the singlet excited state; (ii) direct photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet state to produce a singlet charge separated state; (iii) parallel intersystem crossing from the singlet excited state to produce the triplet state; (iv) photoinduced charge transfer from the triplet, producing the charge separated state. Analysis of the spectral evolution dynamics at 600 nm reveals biphasic kinetics, with an ultrafast component (τ
					≈ 0.5 ps) combined with a slower phase (τ
					≈ 4.2 ps). The ultrafast dynamics may correspond to a combination of vibrational cooling, singlet–triplet intersystem crossing and direct photoinduced charge transfer from the singlet state, whereas the 4.2 ps component is likely due to photoinduced charge transfer from the triplet state. Importantly, since photoinduced electron transfer occurs from both the singlet and triplet manifolds of the Pt2Th chromophore, the charge separated state is therefore produced as a mixture of singlet and triplet spin-states.
Photovoltaic device peformance
In order to explore the performance of the triad as the active material in OPVs, photovoltaic devices were constructed on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates by using spin-coating to first deposit a PEDOT-PSS hole-transport layer followed by the Pt2ThC60 active layer. (On the basis of profilometry thickness measurements of the PEDOT-PSS films and the combined PEDOT-PSS/Pt2ThC60 films, the thickness of the PEDOT-PSS and Pt2ThC60 layers is estimated to be 25 and 29 nm, respectively.) The LiF/aluminum electrode was then deposited onto the active layer in an evaporator system under high vacuum. Each ITO substrate was masked and etched to allow an array of 4 active solar cell “pixels” having an area of 0.25 cm2 for each pixel, and the measurements shown are representative of tests conducted on at least 3 different pixels.
Operating under standard solar simulator conditions (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2), the Pt2ThC60 based devices exhibit a short circuit current density (Isc) of ∼0.5 mA cm−2 (Fig. 5a), an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.41 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 28%. The overall solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency (η) of the devices is 0.05%. The IPCE curve (Fig. 5b) qualitatively mirrors the absorption spectrum of Pt2ThC60, with a weak tail in the visible region, coming to a maximum response in the near-UV at a wavelength corresponding to the absorption of the platinum-acetylide chromophore. The peak external quantum efficiency of the device is 22% in the 360–370 nm region under a monochromatic light intensity of ≈10 μW cm−2.
 Fig. 5  (a) I–V characteristics and (b) photocurrent action spectrum of Pt2ThC60 based photovoltaic device, IPCE vs. wavelength. (IPCE is the incident photon to current efficiency which corresponds to the external quantum efficiency of the photovoltaic device). 
In addition to the device with Pt2ThC60 as the active layer, OPV devices were fabricated using either a spin-coated blend of Pt2Th/PCBM (1/4 wt ratio) or a blend of Pt2ThC60/PCBM (1/1.5 wt ratio). (The blend ratios were adjusted to keep the overall donor/acceptor ratio the same in the two systems.) In all cases devices with these blends displayed weaker photovoltaic response under 100 mW cm −2/AM1.5 solar illumination compared to devices that contained exclusively Pt2ThC60 in the active layer. In particular, devices that contained a blend of Pt2ThC60/PCBM exhibited an overall efficiency of 0.02%, which is approximately 3 times less efficient compared to devices that contained only Pt2ThC60. On the other hand, the overall efficiency of devices that contained a blend of Pt2Th and PCBM was 100 times lower than that of Pt2ThC60/PCBM device. The difference in efficiency of the different devices arises mainly due to the difference in their short-circuit photocurrent densities (100 mW cm −2/AM1.5 illumination) which were 0.11 mA cm−2 for Pt2ThC60/PCBM and 0.005 mA cm−2 for Pt2Th/PCBM. The results obtained with the oligomer-PCBM blends underscore the importance that the Pt2ThC60 molecular structure and solid material morphology plays in giving rise to efficient photovoltaic response to OPV devices that contain this material in the active layer.
Discussion
As noted in the introduction, in an earlier investigation36 we found that organic photovoltaic devices constructed using a blend of a platinum-acetylide polymer and PCBM as the active layer operate with moderate efficiency, displaying a peak external quantum efficiency of ≈10% and an overall power conversion efficiency of 0.33%. The overall power conversion efficiency of these cells is limited in part by the fact that the platinum-acetylide polymer absorbs mainly in the near-UV region and, consequently, the solar light harvesting efficiency of the active material is low. We suggested that the comparatively high quantum efficiency of the cells in the blue region was due, at least in part, to the effect of the triplet state on promoting efficient exciton diffusion to the donor–acceptor interface and to promoting charge separation from the geminate electron-hole pair formed by photoinduced electron transfer.
As a follow-up to this previous investigation, we sought to design a molecular system that would allow us to study in more detail the mechanism, efficiency, and dynamics of photoinduced charge transfer from the platinum-acetylide chromophore to a fullerene acceptor. In order to address this objective, we designed and synthesized the Pt2ThC60 triad. This molecule contains the same platinum-acetylide chromophore that comprised the polymer repeat unit structure in the previous OPV study, covalently linked to two fulleropyrrolidine moieties as electron acceptors. Given the similarity in structure of the donor and acceptor components of the triad to the platinum-acetylide polymer (donor) and PCBM (acceptor) which were used in the previous investigation, we believe that the results obtained in the present study are relevant to providing insight into the fundamental steps involved in light absorption and charge separation in platinum-acetylide based OPVs.
Energetics of photoinduced charge transfer in Pt2ThC60
In order to determine the energetics for photoinduced charge transfer in the triad, it is necessary to estimate the energy of the charge separated state, (C60–[Pt2Th+˙]–C60−˙) (ECS). This energy can be estimated from the first oxidation and reduction potentials obtained by cyclic voltammetry of Pt2ThC60 in o-DCB solvent according to the following expression,49,52,53 (4)The first term in eqn (4) (ΔE1/2) is the difference in the first oxidation and reduction potentials for the triad (1.45 V), and it corresponds to the energy of the charge separated state in the hypothetical situation where the donor and acceptor are at infinite separation in the solvent used for the electrochemical measurements (o-DCB). The second term in eqn (4) (ΔGCoulomb) is a correction applied to account for the fact that in the triad the electron and hole pair are separated by a finite distance, and therefore the charge separated state is stabilized by Coulombic interaction. The third term (ΔGs) accounts for the solvent effect on the energies of the ions, since the solvent used for spectroscopy (CHCl3) is different from that used for the electrochemistry (o-DCB). While various analytical expressions based on dielectric continuum models have been used to calculate ΔGCoulomb and ΔGs,49,52,53 in general it has been found that these expressions tend to over-estimate the effects for dyads in which the donor–acceptor separation is small and/or when relatively non-polar or highly polarizable solvents are under consideration.54 Since both of these situations apply for Pt2ThC60, we prefer to not apply corrections for ΔGCoulomb and ΔGs, and accordingly we use ΔE1/2 (1.45 eV) as an estimate for ECS. While this value is clearly an estimate, as outlined below it is consistent with all of the experimental evidence.

Scheme 2 presents a Jablonski diagram that provides the relative energies of the lowest excited states for triad Pt2ThC60. The energies of the lowest singlet and triplet states (3.02 and 2.13 eV, respectively) were estimated from the λmax values for the fluorescence and phosphorescence from the model complex Pt2Th, and the energy of the charge separated state was estimated as described above. The energies of the singlet and triplet states of the fulleropyrrolidine chromophore are estimated based on literature values.55 Given this information, it is possible to compute the free energies for photoinduced charge transfer (ΔGCS) to a C60 unit from the singlet and triplet states of the Pt2Th chromophore, (5)where Ees is the relevant excited state energy. Using eqn (5), we compute that ΔGCS for the singlet and triplet states (processes ET(S) and ET(T), respectively, in Scheme 2) is −1.57 and −0.68 eV, respectively.
 Scheme 2  Energy level diagram of Pt2ThC60. 
Finally, we note that several features support placement of the charge separated state at 1.45 eV (or below). First, the picosecond transient absorption spectra of Pt2ThC60 (Fig. 4) show no evidence that charge recombination in the charge separated state leads to formation of the triplet state of the fulleropyrrolidine which lies at ca. 1.50 eV above the ground state.55 In previous studies of chromophore–fullerene dyads it has been shown that when the energy of the charge-separated state is above that of the fullerene triplet, charge recombination affords a significant yield of the fullerene-based triplet state which absorbs strongly at λmax
					≈ 700 nm and has a lifetime into the μs time domain.56 Second, as noted above, photoluminescence experiments carried out in a 2-methyltetrahydrofuran glass at 80 K show that the fluorescence and phosphorescence of the triad is still virtually completely quenched in the glass. This finding clearly demonstrates that photoinduced electron transfer in the singlet and triplet state is still active in the glassy solvent matrix. Previous studies carried out on covalently linked chromophore–quencher assemblies have shown that photoinduced electron transfer only occurs in glassy solvents when the driving force is greater than or equal to the reorganization energy (λ) for electron transfer, i.e., −ΔGCS > λ. While the present investigation has not provided any direct information concerning the value of λ for photoinduced electron transfer in Pt2ThC60, it is likely ≥0.5 eV. Thus, the observation that the phosphorescence remains quenched in the glass is consistent with the Pt2Th triplet state, which lies at 2.13 eV, being more than 0.5 eV above the charge separated state.
Dynamics of charge transfer in Pt2ThC60
The picosecond transient absorption spectra of Pt2Th and Pt2ThC60 shown in Fig. 4 provide insight concerning the mechanism of photoinduced electron transfer in the Pt2ThC60 triad. First, the spectra of Pt2Th show that the singlet excited state (λmax = 650 nm) is produced within the sub-ps excitation pulse and within several ps it undergoes intersystem crossing to the triplet state (λmax = 609 nm, kISC
					≈ 1012 s−1). The spectra and dynamics of Pt2ThC60 suggest that the singlet state undergoes intersystem crossing and photoinduced electron transfer in parallel (kS(ET) + kISC
					≥ 1012 s−1). The fraction of excited states that go on to the triplet state subsequently undergo electron transfer rapidly (albeit more slowly than the singlet) with k
					≈ 2 × 1011 s−1. Although it is not possible to quantitatively assess the contributions of the singlet and triplet pathways to photoinduced charge transfer (ET(S) and ET(T) pathways in Scheme 2), given that the transient absorption spectrum of the triad at 1 ps delay appears to be dominated by the triplet state, it seems likely that the predominant path is via the triplet state. If this is correct, then the majority of the charge separated state is produced as a spin-triplet, e.g., 3(C60–[Pt2Th+˙]–C60−˙).
Analysis of the decay of the transient absorption due to the charge separated state affords the rate for charge recombination, kCR
					≈ 2.6 × 109 s−1. This rate is relatively rapid by comparison with other donor–acceptor dyad and triad assemblies. Indeed the rate of charge recombination in Pt2ThC60 is in line with charge recombination rates observed in covalently linked porphyrin–fullerene and oligothiophene–fullerene dyads where the charge separated state is a spin-singlet and the donor–acceptor coupling is comparatively large as it is in Pt2ThC60.27,57–59 Thus, in the Pt2ThC60 triad there does not seem to be a pronounced effect of triplet spin-state on the lifetime of the charge separated state that is produced by photoinduced electron transfer. One possible reason that the charge separated state does not have a much longer lifetime is that the platinum centers promote rapid triplet → singlet intersystem crossing in the charge separated state, effectively lifting the spin-restriction to charge recombination.
Photovoltaic performance
One of the most surprising findings of the present investigation is the fact that OPVs which contain solely Pt2ThC60 exhibit comparatively good photovoltaic response. In particular, the IPCE of 22% observed with 360 nm illumination and overall power efficiency and short circuit photocurrent obtained under 100 mW cm −2/AM1.5 illumination (0.056% and 0.5 mA-cm−2, respectively) are remarkably high for a dyad- or triad-based OPV. By comparison, recent studies of dyad-based OPVs show overall power conversion efficiencies in a range of 0.0024 to 0.041%60–62 with short circuit photocurrents in the μA and nA range.28,57,60,63
The good photovoltaic response obtained with Pt2ThC60 shows that charge separation remains very efficient in the pure solid material. In addition, the results demonstrate that both hole and electron transport in the material are efficient. We speculate that the good photovoltaic performance of the material may be related to the manner in which the molecules pack into the glassy solid. It is possible that photoinduced charge transfer directly produces a charge separated state in which the hole and electron reside on separate Pt2ThC60 molecules. Then the good electron mobility of the C60 components facilitates transport of the photogenerated electrons to the metal electrode. We infer that the holes are transported via a hopping mechanism between adjacent Pt2Th units in the material. These processes are illustrated schematically in the diagram shown in Fig. 6.

Conclusion
A novel fulleropyrrolidine end-capped platinum acetylide donor–acceptor triad assembly was synthesized and characterized by using photophysical methods. Transient absorption studies indicate that photoinduced charge transfer occurs very rapidly following photoexcitation of the platinum-acetylide chromophore with a 400 nm excitation pulse. Although quantitative assessment of the contributions of the singlet and triplet electron transfer pathways is not possible, we believe that photoinduced charge transfer occurs predominantly from the triplet state which is produced very rapidly following photoexcitation. This means that the geminate ion radical pair which is produced by photoinduced electron transfer is in a triplet spin state. Despite the possible involvement of the triplet in the charge separation process, the charge separated state decays rapidly. The rapid decay of the charge separated state may occur because the heavy metal platinum centers also promote rapid triplet → singlet intersystem crossing in the ion pair state. Organic photovoltaic cells fabricated using the triad as the active material operate with comparatively good efficiency. This result shows that photoinduced charge transfer and charge carrier transport are efficient in the glassy solid matrix consisting of Pt2ThC60.
