    , Accepted 10th August 2012First published on 13th August 2012AbstractWe report the new design of a high-activity model for photocatalytic nanosystem comprising an Ag core covered with an approximately 2 nm thick nanoshell of Ag3(PO4)1–x (Ag@Ag3(PO4)1–x) on the ZnO NRs that are visible-light-sensitive photofunctional electrodes with strong photooxidative capabilities to evolve O2 from water. The maximum photoconversion efficiency that could be successfully achieved was 2%, with a significant photocurrent of 3.1 mA cm−2. Furthermore, in addition to achieving a maximum IPCE value of 90%, it should be noted that the IPCE of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x photosensitized ZnO photoanodes at the monochromatic wavelength of 400 nm is up to 60%. Our photoelectrochemical performances are comparable to those of many oxide-based photoanodes in recent reports. The improvement in photoactivity of PEC water-splitting may be attributed to the enhanced near-field amplitudes resulting from localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Ag–core and absorption edge of the Ag3(PO4)1−x nanoshell, which increase the rate of formation of electron–hole pairs at the nearby surface of Ag3(PO4)1−x nanoshell and ZnO nanorod, thus enlarging the amount of photogenerated charge contributing to photocatalysis. The capability of developing highly photoactive Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x-photosensitized ZnO photoanodes opens up new opportunities in various photocatalytic areas, particularly solar-hydrogen fields.

Broader context
Global climate warming and environment pollution have spurred scientists to develop new high-efficiency and environmentally-friendly energy technologies. Hydrogen is an ideal fuel for proton exchange membrane fuel cell applications. Hydrogen has to be produced from renewable and carbon-free resources using natural energies such as sunlight if one thinks of clean energy and environmental issues. In this regard, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell consisting of semiconductor photoelectrodes that can harvest light and use this energy directly for splitting water is a more promising method for hydrogen generation. Recently, researchers have explored the applicability of plasmonic photocatalysis for organic molecule decomposition, catalytic oxidation, and particularly PEC water splitting. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been few study to date regarding the Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x–ZnO hybrid nanoelectrodes applied into PEC water splitting. In this work, we report the new design of high-activity model for photocatalytic nanosystem comprising an Ag core covered with an approximately 2 nm thick nanoshell of Ag3(PO4)1−x (Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x) on the ZnO nanorods that are visible-light-sensitive photofunctional electrodes with strong photooxidative capabilities to evolve O2 from water. The capability of developing highly photoactive Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x-photosensitized ZnO photoanodes opens up new opportunities in various photocatalytic areas, particularly solar-hydrogen fields.

Molecular hydrogen has the potential to quench the world's clean energy thirst and can, in principle, be made by the photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of a water molecule into its gaseous components, hydrogen and oxygen.1 In practice, production of hydrogen is hindered by the remarkable stability of water itself, because the free energy required for the overall process (2H2O → 2H2 + O2) amounts to 113.38 kcal.1–3 The challenge lies mainly in the formidable complexity of the oxidative half-reaction (2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−), in which the release of diatomic O2 involves an overall four-electron/four-proton process with the final formation of an oxygen–oxygen bond.4 This emphasizes the significance of developing active photoanodes with strong photooxidative capabilities to evolve O2 from water. Oxide semiconductors such as ZnO or TiO2 have been recognized as a promising photoelectrode, but its bandgap is too wide to absorb sunlight efficiently. Historically, metal or anion doping into oxide semiconductors are the popular strategies for narrowing bandgaps so as to improve visible-light absorption.5–7 Unfortunately, one of the major drawbacks of doping is that impurity sites easily act as carrier recombination centers, which is a crucial obstacle limiting the overall efficiency of water splitting. Therefore, extensive research efforts have been devoted to circumvent this problem by photosensitization of wide-bandgap semiconductors.8,9 While photosensitization of wide-bandgap semiconductor with sensitizer materials such as quantum dots (Cd-based) and dyes has demonstrated an enhancement in photocatalytic activity,10,11 the present achievements are far from the demands of non-toxicity and environmental friendliness. Especially, sacrificial reagents are commonly adopted to evaluate the photocatalytic activity in quantum dot systems. When the photocatalytic reaction is carried out in an aqueous solution containing reductants, electron donors, or hole scavengers, such as sulfide ions or selenium ions, photogenerated holes irreversibly oxidize the reductant rather than the water.
Another suitable approach is to modify the photoelectrode to localize the photon absorption at the semiconductor surface through the use of surface plasmon-induced near-field enhancement.12 Nanostructures made of noble metals, especially Ag and Au, illuminated under certain specific conditions, exhibit intense localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), i.e., strong resonant charge density oscillations, leading to unusual optical properties.13 Recently, researchers have explored the applicability of plasmonic photocatalysis for organic molecule decomposition, catalytic oxidation, and particularly PEC water splitting.14–19 Nevertheless, the direct exposure of plasmonic metals to the electrolyte might easily lead to their corrosion and dissolution during photocatalytic reaction.20 Attempts to address this problem have mainly centered on the coating of plasmonic metals with a protection layer, which has to be kept sufficiently thin, to separate them from electrolyte. More recently, Yi et al. discovered a new use of silver orthophosphate (Ag3PO4) semiconductor in photocatalytic applications, where a quantum yield of O2 generation from water splitting is nearly 90% under visible light.21 Meanwhile, the theoretical studies on the mechanism of high photocatalytic performance for Ag3PO4 have also been carried out.22 Furthermore, the use of combining an oxide semiconductor with tailored plasmonic-metal nanostructures have been proposed to alleviate the problem of charge-carrier recombination. In this contribution, the key to enable plasmonic photocatalysis is to deposit ZnO nanorods (NRs) uniformly with a monolayer of novel silver@silver phosphate (Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x) core–shell nanoparticles (NPs), allowing for the preparation of next-generation PEC devices that could benefit from the light-scattering ability of high-aspect ratio NRs and the unique properties of core–shell NPs (Fig. 1). The outer nanoshells not only prevent the possibility of photocorrosion of Ag cores during PEC reaction but also introduce novel properties to the hybrid heterostructures in water oxidation.

Herein, we demonstrate a facile and reliable procedure for fabrication of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NP–ZnO NR hybrid nanoelectrodes in the absence of any capping agent. The organic capping agents stabilizing core@shell NPs often limit their application in photocatalytic reaction. The NR arrays were first grown on ITO substrates using a simple electro-deposition method.23 A modified in situ electrochemical deposition approach at room temperature in the case of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NPs subsequently resulted in rapid formation of cable-like nanocomposites.21 These well-characterized Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NPs consisted of 7 ± 1.2 nm Ag cores and 2 ± 0.3 nm thick Ag3(PO4)1−x shells (Fig. 2). The PEC performance of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NP–ZnO NR hybrid nanoarchitectures in water splitting without sacrificial reagents was systematically evaluated. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method was then applied to determine the underlying photocatalytic enhancement mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of photosensitizing ZnO NRs with Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x plasmonic NPs for water oxidation in a non-sacrificial electrolyte.

SEM image of pristine ZnO NRs reveals high surface density (ca. ∼109 rods cm−2) with diameters of about 250 ± 50 nm (Fig. S1†). A typical TEM image of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NP–ZnO NR hybrid nanocomposites at an Ag decoration time of 3 min shows close attachment of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NPs on a ZnO support (Fig. S1†). The high-resolution TEM image of the edge of a NR (Fig. 2) provides more compelling evidence that NP is immobilized on the (002) plane of ZnO surface. Moreover, an abrupt transition is also observed between the (111) plane of Ag core and the (210) plane of Ag3PO4 nanoshell. These are consistent with the XRD data (Fig. S2†). More detailed TEM images with EDX elemental mapping of Zn, O, Ag, and P are shown in Fig. 3, which further confirms the decoration of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NPs on the ZnO NR.

To verify that core@shell NP has an enhancement effect on the light harvesting, the UV-visible absorption spectra of NP–NR hybrid nanoelectrodes are shown in Fig. 4a. In comparison to pristine ZnO NRs, it is apparent that Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x-photosensitized ZnO nanoarchitectures exhibit a significant enhancement in absorption of visible light. To further reveal that there is a specific spectral region in which the absorption is enhanced for Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x–ZnO nanocomposites, the absorption spectra of composite photoelectrodes are normalized to that of pristine ZnO samples. The resultant absorbance enhancement spectra are shown in the inset of Fig. 4a. It is obvious that there is a prominent peak at 430 nm with a shoulder peak around 480–560 nm. The prominent peak arises from LSPR of the Ag core, while the shoulder peak corresponds to the absorption edge of the Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x nanoshell. Besides, to quantify the PEC performance, measurements of incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) were made to study the photoresponse of pristine and Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x photosensitized ZnO NRs as a function of incident light wavelength (Fig. 4b). Pristine ZnO has strong photoresponse only in the near-UV region. Surprisingly, the photosensitized samples display substantial photoactivity in the visible-light region from 400 to 590 nm in addition to strong photoresponse in the near-UV region. Particularly, the IPCE of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x photosensitized ZnO photoanodes at the monochromatic wavelength of 400 nm is up to 60%. The inset of Fig. 4b presents spectral photocurrent measurements on photosensitized nanoelectrodes taken in a two-electrode PEC cell. The photocurrent enhancement spectra are generated by normalizing the photocurrent of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x–ZnO nanocomposites to that of pristine ZnO samples. The strongest resonant peak enhancement of 10.6× is clearly observed at 425 nm, which results from the impact of the Ag core. The additional spectral peak at 550 nm (with a 2.3× peak enhancement) depends on the contribution of Ag3(PO4)1−x nanoshell. These results are in good agreement with the UV-visible absorption data (Fig. 4a). It should be noted that plasmonic Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x photosensitization strikingly improves overall visible-light absorption, and induces a tremendous increase of the near-field amplitude at well-defined wavelengths in the visible-light region,14,18,24 which significantly increase the IPCE throughout the entire visible region for NP–NR hybrid photoanode.

(b) Measured IPCE spectra of pristine ZnO NRs and ZnO NRs loaded with Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NPs in the region of 300–650 nm at a potential of 0.4 V (vs. Pt) in two-electrode system. Inset: photocurrent enhancement spectra as a function of wavelength. 
To further obtain the exact efficiency for the water-splitting reaction under simulated AM 1.5 illuminations, systematic PEC measurements without sacrificial reagents were carried out in a 0.5 M aqueous solution of Na2SO4 with a pH of 6.8. Fig. 5a depicts a set of linear-sweep voltammograms recorded on pristine ZnO NRs and ZnO NRs loaded with plasmonic Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NPs after various deposition times of Ag in the dark and under light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. Linear-sweep voltammograms in the dark from −0.2 to +0.6 V show the current range of 10−7 A cm−2. The photocurrent increases drastically with deposition time up to 3 min. Clearly, the plasmonic NP-immobilized ZnO NR nanoarchitectures with decoration time of 3 min manifest a pronounced photocurrent, which increases to 3.1 mA cm−2 at +0.6 V under illumination. In comparison to pristine ZnO NRs, photocurrent density of NP–NR hybrid nanoelectrodes (3 min) is about 6 times greater than that of pristine ZnO NRs with a similar thickness at 0.6 V, which suggests that ZnO loaded with plasmonic Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NPs can effectively improve PEC water-splitting. Moreover, the rate of O2 evolution measured for our hybrid nanocomposites is about 34 μmol h−1. These results are similar to those achieved in top-performing oxide photoanodes in recent reports.17,25–28 However, at decoration times of longer than 3 min, the increase in the size of core@shell NPs plays a predominant role in the deactivation of the photocatalytic performance. The TEM image of ZnO NRs after a deposition time of 5 min shows that large amounts of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NPs aggregated and became a continuous film which covered the surface of ZnO NRs (Fig. S3†). After incident photons are absorbed by the Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x, photoexcited electron–hole pairs are confined within the particle. Photogenerated electron and hole may transfer to the neighboring Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x particles, which led to the degradation of photocurrent response. This is consistent with the UV-visible absorption and IPCE data (Fig. S3†). Furthermore, in order to quantitatively explore the photoactivity of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x-photosensitized ZnO NRs, the efficiency (η) of applied bias photon-to-current generation is calculated using an equation in which the contribution due to applied potential is subtracted from the total efficiency.29 Significantly, it is worth mentioning that the plot of efficiency versus applied potential (Fig. 5b) shows the maximum value of efficiency is 2% at an applied potential of +0.5 V, which is also higher than recently reported values for other oxide-based photoanodes.27,30 We can understand the photocatalytic enhancement observed under visible illumination by simulating the electromagnetic response of the Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NP–ZnO composites using the FDTD method.18,24 The importance of the intense local fields can be seen in Fig. 6, showing a cross-sectional plot of the electric field distribution of the hot spot regions in the z-dimension. In the local hot spot region, the electric field intensity at Ag3(PO4)1−x and ZnO surface are much higher than that of the incident electromagnetic radiation under 430 nm wavelength illuminations due to LSPR of the Ag core (Fig. 6a). This process would result in the rapid formation of electron–hole pairs near the surface of Ag3(PO4)1−x and ZnO.18,24 Simulation results shown in Fig. 6b also clearly demonstrate the occurrence of intense electric fields at the nearby Ag3(PO4)1−x and ZnO surface under 550 nm wavelength illuminations owing to the absorption edge of Ag3(PO4)1−x–nanoshell. These can evidently explain why the Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x-photosensitized ZnO samples could display excellent photoactivity in the visible-light region from 400 to 590 nm. Therefore, the improvement in photoactivity of PEC water-splitting may be attributed to the enhanced near-field amplitudes resulting from LSPR of Ag–core and absorption edge of Ag3(PO4)1−x–nanoshell, which increase the rate of formation of electron–hole pairs at the nearby surface of Ag3(PO4)1−x and ZnO. These charge carriers formed near the Ag3(PO4)1−x and ZnO surface are readily separated from each other (electrons easily migrate to ZnO–ITO) under the influence of the surface potential, where they can perform photocatalytic transformations. The possible interfacial electron transfer pathways in this hybrid during PEC reactions have also been supplemented (Fig. S4†). Last but not least, the advantage of plasmonic Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x-photosensitized ZnO photoanodes is further exemplified by the good stability (a minimal degradation rate of only 1.3% after 10 h of continuous running) in the water-oxidation process at 0.6 V (the inset of Fig. 5b). This minimal loss in stability test for Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x-photosensitized ZnO photoanodes under sustaining irradiation may result from partial reduction of Ag3(PO4)1−x into metallic Ag (Fig. S5†).

In summary, we have successfully demonstrated highly efficient and stable nanostructured, oxygen-evolving photoanodes obtained by the assembly of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x plasmonic NPs with a support of ZnO NRs. This is the first example of photosensitizing ZnO with plasmonic Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x in a nonsacrificial electrolyte. The maximum photoconversion efficiency that could be achieved was 2%, with a significant photocurrent of 3.1 mA cm−2. Furthermore, in addition to achieving a maximum IPCE value of 90%, it could be noted that the IPCE of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x photosensitized ZnO photoanodes at the monochromatic wavelength of 400 nm is up to 60%. The improvement in photoactivity of PEC water-splitting may be attributed to the enhanced near-field amplitudes resulted from LSPR of the Ag core and absorption edge of Ag3(PO4)1−x nanoshell, which increase the rate of formation of electron–hole pairs at the nearby surface of Ag3(PO4)1−x nanoshell and ZnO–NR, thus enlarging the amount of photogenerated charge contributing to photocatalysis. Our results open new avenues for innovative model design to develop powerful nanoelectrodes in a viable hydrogen economy.
Experimental section
The ZnO NR arrays were grown on indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass as a substrate by a typical electro-deposition method. A piece of Pt foil and a standard silver–silver chloride electrode (Ag–AgCl) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Other details for the NR array growth process are the same as the procedure proposed by Hsu's work.23 A simplified attachment route for Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NPs, namely, in situ electrochemical deposition, was used in this study. First, the ZnO NRs–ITO substrate as cathode and the Pt sheet as anode were immersed in a 0.01–0.05 M silver nitrate solution with 0.6–1 V DC voltage for 0.5–6 min to deposit a monolayer of Ag NPs on the ZnO surface. Then, the anode and the cathode of the DC power source were exchanged and the electrolyte was replaced by a 0.02–0.5 M sodium orthophosphate solution. The Ag NPs on the ZnO surface were gradually oxidized and reacted with orthophosphate anions in situ to form Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NPs on the ZnO surface under a DC voltage of 0.8–1.4 V for several minutes. Finally, the resulting Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x–ZnO nanocomposites were heated in vacuum to 300 °C for several minutes.
For material characterization, SEM measurements were made on a JEOL 6700 field-emission SEM. For obtaining TEM images, the Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x–ZnO nanocomposite products on the ITO substrate were scratched and dispersed on a carbon-coated Cu grid, and analyzed using a JEOL JEM-2100 TEM system. The XRD analyses were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu (40 kV, 40 mA) radiation. UV-visible absorption spectra were carried out with a JASCO V-670 instrument. In PEC water-splitting reaction, a Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x–ZnO photoanode was used as the working electrode with surface area of 0.5–1 cm2 and a platinum plate as counter electrode (2-electrode system). All PEC studies were operated in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution (pH 6.8) as supporting electrolyte medium by using an Electrochemical Multichannel Solartron Analytical System. The water-splitting photoelectrode was illuminated with the AM 1.5 G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. This illumination source matches the shape and intensity of the Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) G173 standard set forth by the American Society of Testing and Materials. The IPCE was calculated using the following equation: IPCE [%] = (1240 × photocurrent density [mA cm−2] × 100)/(wavelength [nm] × photon flux [mW cm−2]). IPCE measurements were performed by 2-electrode system under monochromatic irradiation, emitted from a 150 W Xe lamp equipped with bandpass filters and a variable neutral density filter. Monochromatic photon fluxes at each wavelength were measured using an optical photodiode power meter and were adjusted to around 0.1 mW cm−2 using the neutral density filter. FDTD was used to simulate the electromagnetic field distribution of Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x–ZnO photoanodes under 430 and 550 nm wavelength illuminations. A normal incident light with linear polarization transverse to the plane of incidence (i.e., TM polarization) radiated from the top of the Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x NP. TM (transverse magnetic) polarized light means the electromagnetic wave in which the magnetic field vector is perpendicular everywhere to the plane of incidence (the plane of incidence which includes the normal to the surface and the incident wave vector).

Broader context
Global climate warming and environment pollution have spurred scientists to develop new high-efficiency and environmentally-friendly energy technologies. Hydrogen is an ideal fuel for proton exchange membrane fuel cell applications. Hydrogen has to be produced from renewable and carbon-free resources using natural energies such as sunlight if one thinks of clean energy and environmental issues. In this regard, a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell consisting of semiconductor photoelectrodes that can harvest light and use this energy directly for splitting water is a more promising method for hydrogen generation. Recently, researchers have explored the applicability of plasmonic photocatalysis for organic molecule decomposition, catalytic oxidation, and particularly PEC water splitting. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been few study to date regarding the Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x–ZnO hybrid nanoelectrodes applied into PEC water splitting. In this work, we report the new design of high-activity model for photocatalytic nanosystem comprising an Ag core covered with an approximately 2 nm thick nanoshell of Ag3(PO4)1−x (Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x) on the ZnO nanorods that are visible-light-sensitive photofunctional electrodes with strong photooxidative capabilities to evolve O2 from water. The capability of developing highly photoactive Ag@Ag3(PO4)1−x-photosensitized ZnO photoanodes opens up new opportunities in various photocatalytic areas, particularly solar-hydrogen fields.
