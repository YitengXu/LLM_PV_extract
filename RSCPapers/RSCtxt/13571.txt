Their structures were verified by 1HNMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. All these copolymers exhibit broad absorption bands with small band gaps. UV-vis absorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements indicated that the selenophene inclusion resulted in a reduction in the band gap, which could be attributed to a reduction of oxidation potentials and an increase of the electron affinities of the related copolymer. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that PTTDPSe with selenophene bridges favoured a much more planar conformation than PTTDPO and PTTDPS, which afforded a higher hole mobility of 7.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Photovoltaic properties of the copolymers blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as an electron acceptor were investigated. The polymer solar cell (PSC) based on the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTTDPSe:PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w)/Ca/Al exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.68% with an improved short circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.62 mA cm−2. The primary results show that changing heterocycle bridges with different electron-donating ability can easily and finely tune the optical absorptions, band gaps and energy levels of DPP-containing copolymers. The results also demonstrate that the TT unit is a new and promising electron-donating donor block for constructing highly efficient LBG photovoltaic materials.
Introduction
Low band gap (LBG) donor (D)–acceptor (A) conjugated copolymers have attracted wide interest in the field of polymer solar cells (PSCs) during the past few years.1 In general, a LBG copolymer contains an electron-rich donor and an electron-deficient acceptor on the conjugated polymer backbone, which can form a push–pull configuration and facilitate intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and the acceptor parts.2 Hybridization of the molecular orbitals of the LBG copolymer, with the LUMO typically being dominated by the acceptor and the HOMO by the donor, will efficiently reduce its band gap.3 The energy levels of the LBG copolymer are also important to achieve high photovoltaic performance, which can be finely tuned by choosing different donor and acceptor blocks.4 For example, the LUMO level of the polymer donor should be positioned above the LUMO of the fullerene derivative by at least 0.2–0.3 eV to ensure efficient electron transfer,5 and at the same time, the energy gap between the HOMO of the polymer donor and the LUMO of the fullerene derivative should be maximized in order to increase the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the relevant PSCs.6 By using this design strategy, significant progress has been made in this field, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 7% have been obtained for PSCs.4d-f,7
In the design of a donor–acceptor LBG copolymer, the useful approach is to introduce a more rigid and planar donor unit with quinoidal character into the conjugated system, which can efficiently reduce the band gap and enhance π–π stacking.1 Among them, fused thiophene systems are well known to stabilize the quinoidal structure.8 The introduced rigid planar structure can also favor a higher degree of ordering among the copolymer main chains, which minimizes phase separation9 and improves hole mobility to avoid the photocurrent loss in PSCs.10 Efficient photovoltaic conjugated copolymers have been demonstrated using fused thiophenes as donor blocks, such as thienothiophene,11 dithienothiophene,12 dithienopyrrole,13 dithienosilole,4e,14 cyclopentadithiophene,15 and dithienopyran,7f,16 for fine tuning of their band gaps, absorptions, energy levels as well as the relevant device parameters. Based upon the promising photovoltaic performance of the reported fused thiophene donor blocks, we are interested to further extend the conjugation length of the fused thiophene and improve its coplanarity by the incorporation of tetrathienoacene (TT) with four thiophene rings.17 The planarity and S–S interaction of the tetrathienoacene structure promote more ordered π-stacking and higher hole mobility, which are predictors for high charge transport in optoelectronic devices.18 Recently, several groups have reported the synthesis of TT based copolymers for applications in organic thin film transistors (OFETs) with improved oxidation stability and high carrier mobilities.19 It is interesting to note that despite all of the above promising features, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on the photovoltaic properties of TT-containing conjugated copolymers.
Herein, we report synthesis of three new low band gap D–A type photovoltaic copolymers, PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe, with tetrathienoacene (TT) as an electron-donating block and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as an electron-accepting block (Scheme 1). The DPP unit was chosen in this work because it exhibited extremely electron-deficient nature, which could allow access to ultralow band gap materials when co-polymerized with electron-rich moieties through D–A type orbital hybridization.20 Furthermore, the planarity of the DPP skeleton and the ability to accept hydrogen bonds encouraged π–π stacking of the relevant copolymer backbones.21 LBG copolymers based on DPP and different electron-donating donors were rationally designed and synthesized for PSCs with high efficiencies.11a,22 From the reported literature, DPP flanked by the thiophene unit was firstly developed and widely utilized for constructing D–A type photovoltaic copolymers.20 Just recently, some studies have reported that charge transport and other properties could be further improved when the sulfur atom in the thiophene ring was replaced by oxygen or selenium.22a,23 Obviously, different electronic states of furan, thiophene and selenophene skeletons could affect not only the optical and electrochemical characteristics of the relevant conjugated copolymers but also solar cell parameters, such as short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and thus the power conversion efficiency (PCE).22a,23 Therefore, we systematically investigated the relationship between structures and properties of tetrathienoacene–diketopyrrolopyrrole copolymers by changing different flanking groups of the DPP core to finely tune optoelectronic properties for highly efficient PSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the resulting copolymers are depicted in Scheme 1. The organic tin monomers based on tetrathienoacene (TT) were synthesized according to the previous procedures.19d The furan, thiophene and selenophene containing monomers DPO, DPS and DPSe were also prepared according to the literature.24 Polymers PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe were then prepared through Stille-coupling polymerization with good yields using Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tolyl)3 as catalysts. The crude copolymers were purified by sequential Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and CHCl3. The CHCl3 solutions were concentrated and precipitated in methanol to afford black solid samples. The chemical structures of PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. These copolymers exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents, such as toluene, chloroform, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, which could be attributed to the introduced long and/or branched alkyl chains on TT and DPP skeletons. The molecular weights (Mw) and polydispersity index (PDI, Mw/Mn) of the resulting copolymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using monodisperse polystyrenes as standards and chloroform as eluent. PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe had number average molecular weights (Mn) of 20.6, 28.1 and 26.3 kDa, respectively, and PDIs of 2.96, 3.15 and 2.88, respectively. Good thermal stability of the photovoltaic polymer is necessary for device fabrication and measurements. Decomposition onset temperatures (Td) (about 5% weight loss) were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to be 405, 406 and 411 °C for PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe, respectively. The thermal stabilities of these copolymers are adequately suitable for their applications in PSCs. PTTDPO with furan bridges exhibited a little worse thermal stability than that of PTTDPS with thiophene linkers. However, the introduction of selenophene improved the thermal stability of PTTDPSe with Td up to 412 °C. On the other hand, no endo- or exothermal signals were observed from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements in the range of 0–250 °C from the second heating and cooling runs. The results of molecular weights and the thermal analysis are listed in Table 1.

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption properties of the obtained copolymers were measured both in CHCl3 solutions (Fig. 1a) and thin films spin-coated on quartz slides (Fig. 1b). The spectroscopic data are listed in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 1a, all these copolymers showed broad wavelength absorption in the 300 to 1000 nm range, indicating the relatively rigid and planar polymer backbones with a high degree of conjugation between the donor and acceptor units within the present polymer systems. The absorption spectra of these copolymers in CHCl3 solution gave rise to two absorption bands, as is commonly observed in conjugated D–A copolymers.2 The high energy band ranging from 300 to 500 nm can be attributed to the π–π* electronic transitions of the conjugated polymer backbones. Another broad distinct peak in the wavelength range 500–1000 nm arises from intramolecular charge–transfer transitions (ICT) between the donor segments and the acceptor moieties.25PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe have absorption maxima at 802, 808 and 816 nm, respectively, with a shoulder at shorter wavelengths of 700–800 nm. Although the absorption shapes are similar to each other, the red-shift of absorption peaks was observed from PTTDPO, PTTDPS to PTTDPSe in turn, with furan, thiophene and selenophene bridges, respectively. Similar behaviour was observed from the absorption spectra of these copolymers as thin solid films (Fig. 1b). Relative to their counterparts in the solution state, the absorption shapes became very broad in the wavelength range of 500–1000 nm, and the peaks showed slight blue-shifts for all of these copolymers. This shift phenomenon may be caused by their unique H-aggregation-induced interchain packing in the solid state.12c,26 The blue-shift behavior of the absorption spectrum in the film state was also observed in other DPP-containing conjugated copolymers.12c,26 The optical band gaps, obtained from the onsets of the absorption spectra in thin solid films, were estimated to be 1.33, 1.30 and 1.28 eV for PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe, respectively. The results suggest that changing the electron-donating ability of bridges between the TT donor and DPP acceptor can easily and finely tune the band gaps of this type of copolymer. Comparing PTTDPO and PTTDPS, polymer PTTDPSe with selenophene linkers presented a lower band gap, which is helpful to improve the Jsc of the relevant PSCs.23c Similar effects have been observed in other reported selenophene-containing LBG copolymers for photovoltaic applications.12c,23c,24b,24c,27

Electrochemical properties
The energy levels are important parameters to select appropriate acceptors in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs.28 In order to investigate the electrochemical properties of the copolymers and estimate their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in a three-electrode cell, using 0.10 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (n-Bu4NClO4) as the supporting electrolyte in anhydrous acetonitrile. A platinum plate coated with a thin film of the studied copolymer, a platinum wire and Ag/AgCl (0.1 M) were used as the work, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The energy level of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated against the Fc/Fc+ system to be 4.40 eV by using previous methods.29 The electrochemical curves of the copolymers are shown in Fig. 2 and clearly indicate a reversible oxidation and reduction process. As shown in Fig. 2, the onset oxidation potentials (Eox,onset)/reduction potentials (Ered,onset) of the PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe occurred at 0.91/−0.68, 0.86/−0.66 and 0.79/−0.64 eV, respectively. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe were then estimated to be −5.31/−3.72, −5.26/−3.74 and −5.19/−3.76 eV, respectively, according to the empirical formula, HOMO = −(Eox,onset + 4.4) (eV), LUMO = −(Ered,onset + 4.4) (eV).29 Thus, the electrochemical band gaps (Eg) of PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe were calculated to be around 1.59, 1.52 and 1.43 eV, respectively. The values and their trends are consistent with those obtained by the optical method described above. The corresponding electrochemical data are summarized in Table 2. The results demonstrate that the usage of furan, thiophene and selenophene linkers will reduce the oxidation potentials and increase the electron affinities of the relevant copolymers in turn. This affords PTTDPSe the lowest band gap among the three DPP-containing copolymers, which is in agreement with other previous studies.30

Theoretical calculations. 
In order to further understand the electronic properties of the copolymers, their properties were modeled using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.25d Three repeating units (trimers) of PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe were studied as the model compounds for simulation of the corresponding three copolymers. For simplicity, long alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups because they did not significantly affect the equilibrium geometries or electronic properties.25d The HOMO and LUMO wave functions of the model compounds are shown in Fig. 3. All the polymers show similar distributions for both the HOMO and LUMO. The results indicated that the electron density of the HOMO and LUMO was mainly distributed in the middle part of the conjugated molecular skeleton, however, the LUMO was mainly focused on the DPP units. Compared with the HOMO, HOMO−1 orbitals are mainly on the DPP units, and are not strongly localized on the electron-rich TT cores. The electron density seemed to be distributed from the middle part to two side parts, which implied that the internal charge transfers were possible in these conjugation systems. This transfer trend is more evident from the LUMO to LUMO+1. As a result, low band gaps of PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe would be induced by these efficient internal charge transfer processes. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe trimers were calculated to be −4.64/−2.82 eV, −4.68/2.91 eV and −4.59/2.96 eV, respectively. The band gaps were then determined to be 1.86, 1.77 and 1.63 eV. Clearly, the effect of the heterocycle linker on the band gaps was similar to those results obtained from the CV and UV-vis evaluations.

Hole mobility
In PSCs, Jsc and FF are directly limited by the hole mobility of the used photovoltaic polymers. Higher charge mobilities would enable better charge transport within an active layer without large photocurrent loss caused by recombination of opposite charges. Thus, charge mobility is a very important parameter for efficient photovoltaic polymers. Hole-only devices in this work, with a structure of ITO/PEDOT/polymer/MoO3/Au, were fabricated to determine the hole mobilities of the resulting copolymers via a space charge limit current (SCLC) method.31 The mobility was determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC, which is described by the following equation:  where J is the current, μh is the zero-field mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, d is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the effective voltage. The effective voltage can be obtained by subtracting the built-in voltage (Vbi) and the voltage drop (Vs) from the substrate's series resistance from the applied voltage (Vappl), V = Vappl − Vbi − Vs. The hole mobility can be calculated from the slope of the J1/2–V curves. The results are plotted as J1/2vs. V, as shown in Fig. 4a. According to the above equation and Fig. 4a, the hole mobilities of PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe are calculated to be 2.4 × 10−4, 4.7 × 10−4 and 7.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. PTTDPSe exhibited the highest hole mobility under the same conditions, which is about 1.7 and 3.3 times than those of PTTDPO and PTTDPS. The high hole mobility of these copolymers originated from the good planarity with TT donor blocks. The optimized molecular geometries of the model compounds (trimers) of PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe are illustrated in Fig. 4b. The results of ab initio calculations indicated that they favoured planar conformations both from top and side views, which could enable the electrons to be delocalized across the whole conjugated molecular system for achieving higher carrier mobility.32 It is interesting to note that PTTDPSe with selenophene linkers exhibited more planar conformations than PTTDPO and PTTDPS, especially from side view observations. The linear polymer backbones would enhance the intermolecular π–π stacking and enable PTTDPSe to obtain ordered packing in the solid film. This was also confirmed by the dihedral angle data of TT and the neighboring substituents. The dihedral angles were determined to be about 35.60°, 23.18° and 0.005° for PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe, respectively, which indicated that the TT and neighboring selenophene ring in PTTDPSe are almost coplanar. This was further identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of the corresponding copolymer films cast from the chlorobenzene (CB) solutions. As shown in Fig. 5, all the films displayed two diffraction peaks in the ranges of 4–5° and 20–30°, which were related to the lamellar spacings (dl) and the stacking distances (dπ) between coplanar conjugated polymers. Furthermore, these two types of reflection peaks were gradually increased from PTTDPO, PTTDPS to PTTDPSe films. The dl-spacings and dπ-spacings were calculated to be 21.6 Å, 20.8 Å, 20.2 Å and 3.81 Å, 3.73 Å, 3.70 Å for PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe, respectively. The smallest dl and dπ spacings of the PTTDPSe film indicated that the interchain packing and the π–π stacking were enhanced when using selenophene linkers, which could also well explain the reason why PTTDPSe had the highest mobility discussed above.

Photovoltaic properties. 
To explore the solar cell properties of these TT-based copolymers, conventional BHJ PSCs were fabricated and evaluated according to our previous work.7b,7g,13c,22d The device structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. PC71BM was chosen here instead of PC61BM due to its significantly broader and stronger absorption in the visible region.33 The fabrication conditions were optimized by changing many parameters, such as the ratio of the copolymer to PC71BM, the thickness of the active layer, the type and amount of solvents as well as the additives. The active layers were finally spin-coated on the copolymers and PC71BM in the mixture solution of chloroform (CF):o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) (3:1, v/v), and the optimal weight ratio of copolymer to PC71BM was found to be 1:1.5 (w/w) for PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe. The optimal thicknesses for blend films of PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe with PC71BM were about 100, 95 and 100 nm, respectively. To examine the influence of solvent additives on device performance, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was initially used, but no improvements in the PCEs were observed for any of the TT-containing copolymers. However, when 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) was used instead of DIO, the device performance was significantly improved in all cases and the optimized additive amount was found to be 5 vol%. All the PSC devices in this work were evaluated under simulated 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G illumination. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are plotted in Fig. 6a, and the photovoltaic data of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE are summarized in Table 3.

As shown in Fig. 6a and Table 3, the PSC device achieved PCEs of 3.84%, 4.55% and 5.68% for PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe, respectively. It is well known that the Voc is proportional to the difference between the HOMO level of the polymer donor and the LUMO level of PCBM.34 As expected, the PTTDPO device exhibited the highest Voc of 0.63 V due to its lowest-lying HOMO level determined by CV measurements. When using thiophene and selenophene groups instead of the furan unit, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe devices showed lower Voc, but enhanced Jsc due to their smaller band gaps, better crystallinity as well as improved hole mobilities. The improved FFs of PTTDPS and PTTDPSe devices indicated that these devices had relatively low serial resistance.35 From the J–V curves, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe devices showed series resistances (Rs) of 6.1 and 6.5 Ω cm2, while an Rs of 9.7 Ω cm2 was observed from the PTTDPO device. Among these PSCs, the PTTDPSe device exhibited the best performance with a Voc of 0.58 V, a Jsc of 15.62 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.62, giving rise to a PCE of 5.68%. The superior performance of the PTTDPSe device over PTTDPO and PTTDPS devices, despite its lower Voc and comparable FF, could be attributed to its significantly increased Jsc. This was exactly verified by external quantum efficiency (EQE) evaluation of the related active layers. The EQE spectra of the PSCs based on PTTDPO:PC71BM, PTTDPS:PC71BM and PTTDPSe:PC71BM are shown in Fig. 6b. The response of the PTTDPSe device showed a wider curve shape and higher photoconversion efficiency than the other two devices. The Jsc values calculated by integrating the EQE curves with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum are within 5% error compared to the corresponding Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves. The highest EQE of about 61% for the PTTDPSe blend induced the highest Jsc of 15.62 mA cm−2, which was in agreement with the integrated Jsc of 15.20 mA cm−2.
The morphology of the blend films with fine phase separation is also very important for high performance PSCs.2,4,7 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to investigate the morphology of the copolymer:PC71BM films (1:1.5, w/w, with 5% CN) fabricated in these devices, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. From the images, the dark and light regions represent fullerene and polymer domains, respectively. All the blend films look very uniform with bi-continuous networks, indicating the good miscibility between the resulting copolymers and PC71BM. Obviously, the PTTDPO:PC71BM blend showed weak phase separation. However, the PTTDPS:PC71BM blend presented the stronger phase separation with some fibril features. Furthermore, the PTTDPSe:PC71BM blend showed similar phase separation with the PTTDPS:PC71BM film, but the fibril features became more evident and the length of the fiber was increased. This type of favorable morphology is expected to improve charge separation and transport in PSC devices.7f,22c The TEM results are also consistent with the superior photovoltaic performance of PTTDPSe compared to the other two TT-containing copolymers. It is believed that the photovoltaic performance of this type of copolymer containing TT and DPP blocks can be further improved by the optimization of film morphology and device fabrication conditions.

Conclusions
A new series of low band gap D–A copolymers based on tetrathienoacene (TT) donor and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor blocks, PTTDPO, PTTDPS and PTTDPSe, were firstly designed and synthesized for photovoltaic applications. These copolymers exhibit broad absorption bands with small band gaps. The influence of heterocycle bridges, such as furan, thiophene and selenophene units, on the optical absorptions, electrochemical properties as well as carrier mobilities was systematically investigated. The different electron-donating ability of heterocycle linkers between TT and DPP parts can easily and finely tune the band gaps and energy levels of the resulting copolymers. The selenophene group will reduce the oxidation potentials and increase the electron affinities of its relevant copolymer, which affords PTTDPSe the lowest band gap. It is interesting to note that PTTDPSe favours a much more planar conformation than PTTDPO and PTTDPS. This planar polymer backbone can enhance the intermolecular π–π stacking, which enables PTTDPSe to obtain ordered packing in the solid film with high carrier mobility. The single-layer solar cell devices based on these copolymers and PC71BM were fabricated and evaluated. The PTTDPSe device exhibited the best performance with a Voc of 0.58 V, a Jsc of 15.62 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.62, giving rise to a high PCE of 5.68%. The primary results also demonstrate that the TT is a new and promising electron-donating block for constructing highly efficient LBG photovoltaic materials.

The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were collected on a Bruker ARX 400 NMR spectrometer with d-chloroform as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. The number- and weight-average molecular weights of the copolymers were determined using Waters 1515 GPC analysis with chloroform as eluent and polystyrene as standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TA Instrument Model SDT Q600 simultaneous TGA/DSC analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 flow rate of 90 mL min−1. UV-vis spectra were obtained on a Carry 300 spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were made on a CHI660 potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, with a platinum wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in an anhydrous nitrogen-saturated acetonitrile solution (0.1 mol L−1) of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4). The copolymers were coated on the platinum plate working electrodes from dilute chloroform solutions.
Device fabrication
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with ITO glass (15 Ω cm−2) as an anode, Ca/Al as a cathode, and the blend film of the copolymer and PC71BM as a photosensitive layer. After spin-coating a 40 nm layer of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP Al 4083) onto the pre-cleaned ITO substrate, the photosensitive layer was subsequently prepared by spin-coating a blend solution of the copolymer and PC71BM (w/w) in the chloroform–1,2-dichlorobenzene mixture on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. The device area was 0.09 cm2. The current–voltage (I–V) characterization of the devices was carried out on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measurement system. The EQE was measured at a chopping frequency of 280 Hz with a lock-in amplifier (Stanford, SR830 DSP) during illumination with the monochromatic light from a xenon lamp. A solar simulator was used as the light source, and the light intensity was monitored using a standard Si solar cell. The thickness of films was measured using a Dektak 6 M surface profilometer. All of the fabrication and characterization processes were conducted in a glove box.
Synthesis of the copolymers


PTTDPO
          . 
Monomer TT-Sn (0.258 g, 0.3 mmol) and monomer DPO (0.295 g, 0.3 mmol) were dissolved in 15 mL toluene. The solution was flushed with argon for 10 min, and then Pd2dba3 (5.5 mg, 2 mol%) and P(o-tolyl)3 (7.3 mg, 8%) were added into the flask. The flask was purged three times with successive vacuum and argon filling cycles. The polymerization reaction was heated to 110 °C and the mixture was stirred for 48 h under an argon atmosphere. 2-Tributylstannyl thiophene (23.7 mL) was added to the reaction, and then after 4 hours 2-bromothiophene (7.5 mL) was added. The mixture was stirred overnight to complete the end-capping reaction. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured slowly into 400 mL methanol. The precipitate was filtered and washed with methanol and hexane in a Soxhlet extraction apparatus to remove the oligomers and catalyst residues. Finally, the polymer was extracted with chloroform. The solution was condensed by evaporation and precipitated into methanol. The polymer was collected as a dark purple solid with a yield of 82%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.76–8.54 (m, 2H), 7.52–6.80 (m, 2H), 4.08 (s, 4H), 2.98–2.44 (m, 4H), 1.81–0.93 (m, 98H), 0.92–0.82 (m, 18H). Anal. calcd for (C84H128N2O4S4)n: C, 74.28; H, 9.50; N, 2.06. Found: C, 73.80; H, 9.45; N, 2.13%.



PTTDPS
          . 
Polymer PTTDPS was synthesized as a dark purple solid with a yield of 78% according to the method used for the synthesis of polymer PTTDPO described above using monomer DPS instead of compound DPO. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 9.01–8.80 (m, 2H), 7.60–6.95 (m, 2H), 4.02 (s, 4H), 3.05–2.52 (m, 4H), 1.80–0.91 (m, 98H), 0.90–0.80 (m, 18H). Anal. calcd for (C84H128N2O2S6)n: C, 72.57; H, 9.28; N, 2.01. Found: C, 71.96; H, 9.22; N, 2.08%.



PTTDPSe
          . 
Polymer PTTDPSe was synthesized as a dark purple solid with a yield of 73% according to the method used for the synthesis of polymer PTTDPO described above using monomer DPSe instead of compound DPO. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 9.2–8.86 (m, 2H), 7.78–7.04 (m, 2H), 3.93 (s, 4H), 3.06–2.54 (m, 4H), 1.78–0.90 (m, 98H), 0.89–0.80 (m, 18H). Anal. calcd for (C84H128N2O2S6)n: C, 72.57; H, 9.28; N, 2.01. Found: C, 71.96; H, 9.22; N, 2.08%.
