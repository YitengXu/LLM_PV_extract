    , Accepted 4th May 2018First published on 5th May 2018AbstractThe surface plasmon-enhanced catalytic performance of a gold caviar-like assembly (Au-CA) in methanol electrooxidation was investigated with and without simulated solar irradiation. An Au-CA catalyst synthesized by an ion sputtering method not only exhibited an excellent anodic peak current density (115.86 μA μg−1) but also displayed long-term catalytic stability for methanol electrooxidation. The Au-CA catalyst also provided an anodic peak current density of 248.9 μA μg−1 for methanol electrooxidation under simulated solar irradiation. This value corresponded to a 2.15-fold increase with respect to that in the absence of solar light irradiation in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH and 1.5 M CH3OH. The diffuse reflectance UV-vis absorption spectra and photoelectric response performance of the as-prepared Au-CA catalyst were investigated to understand the effectiveness of the surface plasmon resonance of Au nanoparticles for the enhancement of methanol electrooxidation performance. The results showed that the Au-CA catalyst exhibited a broad absorption peak at a wavelength of 515 nm with a red shift in comparison with that of a solution of Au nanoparticles. The photocurrent density of the Au-CA catalyst was 175.8 μA μg−1 at an irradiation wavelength of 468 nm, which was 2.5 times higher than that at 640 nm (70.2 μA μg−1) in a deoxygenated solution of 0.5 M Na2SO4. These findings suggested the potential of the new strategy for the improvement of the activity and durability of Au in methanol electrooxidation in direct methanol fuel cell technologies.
Introduction
Direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been regarded as environmentally friendly energy equipment for portable electronic devices and transportation vehicles because methanol has a high energy density of 6100 W h kg−1 and is easily stored and transported.1 However, the catalytic activity and durability of DMFCs in the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) on their anode are limited because of the nature of platinum (Pt); for example, the active sites of a Pt catalyst can be blocked by the adsorption of CO-like reaction intermediates, which thereby reduces their energy efficiency and hinders further development.2–5
Pt-based bimetallic alloys have been commonly adopted to produce highly stable anode catalysts. Huang et al.6 reported that the facets of ultrathin Pt–Ru nanocrystals can be tuned via a one-step wet chemistry approach. They demonstrated that 〈111〉-terminated Pt–Ru nanowires exhibit superior activity in the MOR. The forward anodic peak current density reached 800 μA μg−1, but the reverse anodic peak current density remained at 700 μA μg−1. Li et al.7 described a highly crystalline Pt–Cu nanotube with an open architecture and demonstrated that it exhibits high catalytic activity in the MOR and achieved an excellent forward anodic peak current density of 2252 μA μg−1 on a Pt1Cu1–AA catalyst. Moreover, the reverse anodic peak current density had a high value of about 1500 μA μg−1. Sun et al.8 observed that the catalytic properties of a Pt–Pb catalyst in the MOR can be enhanced by controlling or tuning defects (including point defects, line defects and plane defects) and interfaces of Pt–Pb nanoplates via ion irradiation, which achieved forward and reverse anodic peak current densities of about 4422 and 5636 μA μg−1, respectively. Sawy et al.9 prepared Pt–Ir core–shell nanoparticles using a simple polyol method and revealed that a core of Ir can enhance the MOR activity of a catalyst via the bifunctional and electronic effect of Ir. With the aid of the electronic effect of Ir, the adsorption of CO intermediates by a Pt surface can be inhibited, which consequently helps to promote the anti-poisoning properties of a Pt shell.
Although high catalytic performance in methanol electrooxidation can be achieved by alloying Pt with other metals, the high cost, low abundance and CO poisoning of Pt-based MOR catalysts have impeded their large-scale commercial applications.10–13 As a possible alternative to Pt, gold (Au) nanostructures have been studied as potential catalysts of the MOR in DMFCs, because metallic Au possesses exceptional activity for CO oxidation at room temperature at a particle size of ∼5 nm.14–17 Thus, Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) can effectively hinder reaction poisoning by CO intermediates during DMFC operations. Several studies have been devoted to investigating methanol electrooxidation on Au nanostructures. Wittstock et al.18 prepared nanoporous Au nanocrystals by dealloying Au–Ag alloys and demonstrated that the new catalysts with their unique structure can overcome the limits of the low probability of O2 dissociation on Au catalysts in the selective gas-phase oxidative coupling of methanol at low temperatures. Pedireddy et al.19 also developed nanoporous Au NPs via one-step solution-phase synthesis and reported that the as-prepared Au NPs displayed a forward anodic peak current density of 18 μA μg−1 and a reverse anodic peak current density of 6 μA μg−1 in the MOR. Wang et al.20 prepared nanoporous Au NPs via a top-down dealloying approach and demonstrated that pyrogallol-modified nanoporous Au NPs enriched with 〈111〉 facets exhibited an excellent forward anodic peak current density of 263 μA cm−1 and a reverse anodic peak current density of 87 μA cm−1 in the MOR. Guo et al.21 fabricated a hybrid of Au NPs with reduced graphene oxide via a one-pot strategy using chitosan as a deoxidiser and demonstrated that the as-prepared hybrid of Au nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide exhibits good electrochemical activity in the MOR because of the excellent electron conduction properties of reduced graphene oxide, which can offer additional active sites for methanol oxidation.
Catalysts based on various Au nanostructures show potential for methanol electrooxidation. However, the catalytic activity of Au is low in comparison with that of Pt as an MOR catalyst. The photoenhanced electrocatalytic activity of Au has been widely studied because the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Au nanostructures can generate several hot carriers, which can facilitate chemical reactions via the conversion of light energy.22,23 Chen et al.24 prepared hybrids of Au NPs decorated on oxide supports by impregnation and demonstrated that the Au NP hybrids can be used for the light-driven oxidation of formaldehyde. Jin et al.25 fabricated a nanotube heterostructure with a TiO2 bilayer decorated with periodic Au NPs and demonstrated that the activity and stability of Au NPs–TiO2 for ethanol electrooxidation can be enhanced by plasmons in the Au NPs under light irradiation. Wang et al.26 formed Au NPs on the surface of glassy carbon, which were prepared via the thermal reduction of HAuCl4 by sodium citrate, and reported that the electrocatalytic ability of the Au NPs in glucose reactions can be directly improved by plasmons. Lin et al.27 described a 3D dendritic gold nanoforest structure synthesised via a fluoride-assisted galvanic replacement reaction and reported that the catalytic activity of the as-prepared dendritic Au nanoforest for methanol electrooxidation can be induced by light irradiation and it achieved a forward anodic peak current density of 3.14 μA μg−1. In this context, the strong and broad SPR of Au nanostructures can be excited by a solar spectrum to improve the catalytic activity for the electrooxidation of formaldehyde, ethanol and glucose and promote the electrooxidation reactions of small organic molecules. However, the promotion effect on the MOR of plasmons in Au nanostructures is still weak. Considering the exceptional activity of Au nanostructures for CO oxidation during the electrooxidation of small organic molecules,26–28 the plasmonic catalysis of the MOR on Au nanostructures should be further investigated.
In this study, we synthesised a gold caviar-like assembly (Au-CA) catalyst by a self-assembly process via an ion sputtering method, and its surface plasmon-enhanced catalytic performance was investigated. Direct surface plasmon enhancement of the methanol electrooxidation reaction on as-prepared Au samples was observed. The Au-CA catalyst achieved a peak current density of 248.9 μA μg−1 under irradiation, which was about twice that in the dark (115.86 μA μg−1). To study the influence of SPR on the catalytic activity in the methanol electrooxidation reaction, we recorded the X-ray photoelectron spectra and diffuse reflectance UV-vis absorption spectra and examined the photocurrent response of Au-CA 5T. The electronic structures of Au-CA exhibited no obvious change under simulated solar irradiation in comparison with those in the dark. Au-CA achieved a photocurrent density of 175.8 μA μg−1 at an irradiation wavelength of 468 nm. The photocurrent density of this sample was 2.5 times higher than that at 640 nm (70.2 μA μg−1), which indicated that SPR of the Au NPs in the wavelength range of 400–600 nm contributed to the generation of photocurrent in Au-CA. Regarding electrochemical stability, the electrooxidation current density of Au-CA was notably higher under solar light irradiation (51.2 μA μg−1) than under dark conditions (16.5 μA μg−1), even after the reaction duration was extended to 40 min. The surface plasmon enhancement of catalytic activity and stability for the methanol electrooxidation reaction on the as-prepared Au-CA catalyst represents a promising technology for DMFCs.
Experimental section
Fabrication of Au caviar-like assemblies
Au caviar-like assemblies were fabricated on an unheated glassy carbon substrate using a home-built benchtop DC ion sputtering system. The vacuum chamber had a diameter of 12 cm and a height of 12.5 cm. A metallic Au wafer with a purity of 99.99% and a diameter of 6.0 cm was used as the sputtering target. The base pressure in the deposition chamber was about 5.8 × 10−2 mbar. Ultrahigh-purity Ar (99.999%) was employed as the sputtering gas. The pressure of Ar was maintained at a constant value of 20 mbar. The distance between the target and substrate was around 3 cm. The discharge was generated by a DC power supply. The working voltage was maintained at 1 kV. The working current was maintained at 5 mA. The duration of each deposition process was set at 20 s. The amounts of the Au caviar-like assemblies deposited by ion sputtering were calculated by the following equations: w = S × d × ρ and d = k × I × v × t, where w is the weight of deposited metallic Au (μg), S is the GCE area of about 0.19635 cm2, d is the thickness of the deposited Au caviar-like assembly (Å), ρ is the density of Au (19.3 g cm−3), k is a constant (0.17), v is the working voltage (1 kV) and t is the duration of each deposition process (s).
Physical characterisation
The morphology and structure of the as-prepared Au-CA samples were observed by field-emission SEM (FE-SEM; JSM-7500F) and AFM (Bruker Dimension Icon) in tapping mode. TEM images were obtained with a Talos F200X (FEI) transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV. The crystal structure was characterised using HR-TEM (Talos F200X) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and XRD (D/max 2500) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). XPS characterisation was performed with an ESCALAB 250 instrument under an ultrahigh vacuum (10−9 Torr) using monochromated Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV) to examine the valence states and electronic structures of surface Au atoms. All the binding energies were calibrated by the carbon peak (C 1s) at about 284.5 eV. The sizes of Au NPs that were composed of Au caviar-like assemblies were determined on the basis of SEM images using Digital Micrograph analysis software (Gatan, Inc., America). Histograms were plotted by measuring at least 100 particles. Simulated solar radiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2; wavelength of 295–2000 nm) and monochromatic LED sources (wavelengths of 485 and 640 nm, respectively) were used to characterise the photoelectronic properties of Au caviar-like assemblies.
Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical characterisation
A three-electrode configuration was employed. The working electrode was an Au caviar-like assembly deposited on a glassy carbon electrode, the reference electrode was an Hg/HgO (MMO) electrode and the counter electrode was a Pt wire. A mixed solution of 1.0 M KOH and 1.5 M CH3OH was used as the electrolyte solution for characterising the electrocatalytic activity of samples of Au caviar-like assemblies in the MOR. The solutions were deoxygenated by bubbling with high-purity N2 for at least 30 min prior to each measurement. A simulated solar source (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2; wavelength of 295–2000 nm) was used to characterise the plasmon-enhanced electrocatalytic activity of samples of Au caviar-like assemblies in the MOR. The potential range was from −0.4 V to 0.6 V versus Hg/HgO, and the scanning rate was 10 mV s−1. The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) of the Au caviar-like assemblies were determined by integrating the charge associated with the surface redox behaviour of a gold surface in an N2-saturated 0.5 M aqueous solution of H2SO4 in the range of 0.2 V to 1.6 V versus MMO (Hg/HgO) at a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature. A specific charge density of 390 μC cm−2 was assumed for the reduction of Au oxide. A pure glassy carbon electrode was also employed as a control. All the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements were performed at room temperature. The experiments were carried out using a CHI660C electrochemical workstation (Chenhua Instrument, Shanghai).
Results and discussion
Au-CA samples were prepared by a sputtering method using a benchtop DC ion sputtering system.29 In a typical synthesis, the growth conditions of Au NPs during sputtering were optimised by varying the deposition time with a suitable target–substrate distance of 3 cm, sputtering current of 5 mA, and sputtering voltage of 1 kV. The duration of deposition in one period (T) was set at 20 s. A series of Au-CA samples were prepared with deposition times of 0T, 1T, 2T, 3T, 4T, 5T, 6T, 8T, 10T and 12T, and the synthesised samples were labelled as Au-CA 1T, Au-CA 2T, Au-CA 3T, Au-CA 4T, Au-CA 5T, Au-CA 6T, Au-CA 8T, Au-CA 10T and Au-CA 12T, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images indicate that the as-synthesised Au-CA was formed from self-assembled small Au NPs (Fig. 1a and b, S1 and S2†), and its morphology appears as a caviar-like structure (inset of Fig. 1b). The small Au NPs were highly uniform, and their average size was about 25 nm for the sample of Au-CA 5T. The average size of Au NPs in the Au-CA samples could be systematically controlled by varying the deposition time. With an increase in the deposition time for ion sputtering (1T, 2T, 3T, 4T, 5T, 6T and 8T), the average sizes of the Au NPs also increased (5 ± 0.5, 9 ± 0.5, 14 ± 0.5, 18 ± 0.5, 25 ± 0.5, 29 ± 0.5 and 37 ± 0.5 nm, respectively) (Fig. S1a–g†). From Fig. S1h and i,† we noted that the average sizes of the Au NPs were 16 ± 0.5 and 25 ± 0.5 nm with an increase in the deposition time to 10T and 12T, respectively, but the distance between nanoparticles decreased to zero. This result was achieved because the Au NPs synthesised by gas condensation of gold ion vapour on the glassy carbon surface at room temperature were nearly monodisperse; this process occurred via Volmer–Weber self-limiting growth within a short deposition time.30–32 As the deposition time was prolonged, the Volmer–Weber self-limiting growth process of a ‘new’ Au NP was restricted at the interface with a neighbouring ‘old’ Au NP.33Fig. 1c and S3† show the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Au-CA 2T, Au-CA 5T, Au-CA 10T and glassy carbon. The patterns reveal that the diffraction peaks of glassy carbon are located at 25.48°, 43.1° and 78.5°. Moreover, after Au NPs were deposited on glassy carbon, five new diffraction peaks appeared at 38.18°, 44.39°, 64.58°, 77.55° and 81.72°, which can be indexed to the 〈111〉, 〈200〉, 〈220〉, 〈311〉 and 〈222〉 planes of pure Au (JCPDS no. 04-0784), respectively. These findings implied that the Au NPs successfully deposited onto the glassy carbon surface comprised metallic Au crystals. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and the corresponding inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) images of Au-CA 5T are shown in Fig. 1d–f. The TEM image of Au NPs in Fig. 1d reveals that the average size of the Au NPs was about 25 nm. The corresponding selected-area electron diffraction pattern (inset of Fig. 1d) indicates that the Au-CA 5T sample exhibited a similar structure, which was formed from self-assembled small Au NPs, to those indicated by the SEM and AFM results. Moreover, Fig. 1e and f show HR-TEM and IFFT images of Au NPs in the Au-CA 5T sample; the lattice spacings of 0.236 and 0.204 nm in the Au NPs agree with the standard spacings of Au 〈111〉 and 〈200〉, respectively, in pure Au (JCPDS 04-0784; 0.2355 and 0.2039 nm, respectively) (Fig. 1f). In contrast, the numerous 〈111〉 facets present on Au NPs that serve as active sites for the electrooxidation of methanol have been investigated by Ferrin34 and other researchers.35–37 The Au 〈111〉 facet possesses a higher surface atom packing density than the other facets; thus, the Au 〈111〉 facet can adsorb more OH− anions than other facets could and accelerate the oxidation of methanol.38,39 In contrast, partial charge transfer of chemisorbed OH− on the Au 〈111〉 facet results in the formation of preoxidised precursors. Therefore, the catalytic performance of Au-based catalysts for the electrooxidation of methanol is strongly dependent on chemisorbed OH− anions and preoxidised species.

The catalytic activity of Au-CA 5T for the electrooxidation of methanol in the absence of simulated solar irradiation was investigated in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH at 25 °C. Fig. 2a shows a cyclic voltammogram for Au-CA 5T in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH. The illustration displays the typical characteristics of as-prepared Au-CA 5T and the current peaks due to the formation and reduction of gold oxide at 0.35 and 0.18 V (versus MMO), respectively. In the presence of 1.5 M methanol in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH, more significant anodic current peaks for methanol electrooxidation in the forward and reverse potential scans were observed with Au-CA 5T than with the glassy carbon electrode (Fig. 2a and b). This result indicates that as-prepared Au-CA 5T can exhibit efficient activity for the MOR and can hence be used as a methanol electrooxidation catalyst.

The CV curves were measured with a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1, and the MMO (Hg/HgO) electrode was used as the reference electrode. 
To determine the effect of solar light on the electrooxidation of methanol, we studied the catalytic activity of Au-CA 5T in the electrooxidation of methanol in the presence and absence of solar light irradiation (Fig. 2c). As shown, a well-defined anodic peak for the oxidation of methanol appeared in the dark. Upon irradiation using a simulated solar source with a total maximum intensity of 100 mW cm−2, an obvious increase in the anodic current on Au-CA 5T was observed. The peak current density was about 2.15 times higher than that in the dark (increased from 123.6 μA μg−1 to 248.9 μA μg−1) and was comparable to that achieved with a commercial Pt/C catalyst (368 μA μg−1, as shown in Fig. S4†). This increase in peak current density suggests that solar light provided two or three important contributions to the electrooxidation of methanol on Au-CA 5T. The first contribution was the tuning of the electronic structure of Au NPs by SPR induced by solar light irradiation, which increased the catalytic ability of the Au NPs. The second contribution comprised hot holes on the surface of Au NPs, which enhanced the activity of the chemical reactive sites for the electrooxidation of methanol. In addition, the effect of natural light (inside a room) on the methanol electrooxidation performance of Au-CA 5T was also investigated. The results revealed that the CV curves for Au-CA 5T were not influenced by natural light (Fig. S5†). Table 1 compares the catalytic performance of the as-prepared Au-CA samples for methanol electrooxidation with state-of-the-art literature data in terms of the forward anodic peak current (Iforward), reverse anodic peak current (Ireverse) and ratio of forward/reverse anodic peak currents (Iforward/Ireverse). The Iforward/Ireverse values of the as-prepared Au-CA samples were much higher than those of previously reported photocatalysts, including Pt-based, Pd-based and Au-based catalysts. This observation indicates that the anti-CO poisoning performance of the as-prepared Au-CA catalysts was significantly improved. Under simulated solar irradiation, the increases in the Iforward and Iforward/Ireverse values imply that simulated solar irradiation can enhance not only the catalytic activity but also the anti-CO poisoning ability of the Au-CA catalysts during catalysis of the methanol electrooxidation reaction. The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of samples of Au-CA 1T, Au-CA 2T, Au-CA 3T, Au-CA 4T, Au-CA 5T, Au-CA 6T, Au-CA 8T, Au-CA 10T, Au-CA 12T and glassy carbon were calculated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in an N2-saturated 0.5 M solution of H2SO4 (Fig. 2d and S6†). The ECSA values of the different samples are listed in Table 1 and Fig. S7,† and the results reveal that the ECSAs of the different Au-CA catalysts decreased with an increase in the deposition time from 1T to 12T. The decrease in the ECSA of the Au-CA catalysts was attributed to the growth of Au NPs in Volmer–Weber self-limiting mode. The polymerisation effect of Au NPs can lead to a decrease in the specific area of Au-CA samples.

To confirm whether the catalytic activity of Au-CA 5T in the electrooxidation of methanol is enhanced by SPR rather than light-induced changes in electronic structure, we examined the surface deep-level electronic structure of Au-CA 5T by XPS in the presence and absence of simulated solar irradiation. Fig. 3a shows the high-resolution spectra of Au 4f in the Au-CA 5T sample in the presence and absence of simulated solar irradiation and compares the results with that for bulk Au. The vertical dashed lines indicate the locations of the Au 4f peaks for bulk Au. The locations of the Au 4f peaks for Au-CA 5T under simulated solar irradiation did not change markedly with respect to those for bulk Au and Au-CA 5T without irradiation. The valence band spectra of bulk Au and Au-CA 5T in the presence and absence of simulated solar irradiation were also studied. Notably, with respect to that of bulk Au, the d-band centre of Au-CA 5T did not change regardless of the use of simulated solar irradiation. This result reveals that the electronic structure of Au-CA 5T was not altered under simulated solar irradiation. The enhanced activity of Au-CA 5T in the electrooxidation of methanol was not related to the photon-tuned electronic structures of Au NPs. Furthermore, the diffuse reflectance UV-vis absorption spectra of Au-CA 5T, a solution of Au NPs and clean glassy carbon were also recorded. The results (Fig. 3c) reveal an absorption peak at a wavelength of 510 nm in the diffuse reflectance UV-vis absorption spectrum of Au-CA 5T, which was attributed to the SPR absorption of Au NPs. The location of the SPR absorption peak for Au-CA 5T was red-shifted with respect to the peak for the solution of Au NPs. Fig. S8† shows the SPR absorption peaks for Au-CA samples prepared with various deposition times and clean glassy carbon; the SPR absorption peak was red-shifted from 450 nm to 520 nm with an increase in the deposition time from 1T to 8T. However, prolonging the deposition time to 10T and 12T achieved a weak blue shift in the SPR absorption peak, which indicates that the morphology of Au-CA exerts a hypersensitive effect on the SPR absorption features. To further confirm the effect of SPR of Au NPs on the photocurrent response of the Au-CA 5T sample, we used two monochromatic LED light sources to investigate the effect of the light wavelength on photocurrent generation. Fig. 3d shows the photocurrent response between on and off states for Au-CA 5T with respect to the Pt counter electrode during switching on/off of light irradiation in a deoxygenated solution of 0.5 M Na2SO4. The results reveal a photocurrent density of 175.8 μA μg−1 at an irradiation wavelength of 468 nm, which was 2.5 times higher than that of 70.2 μA μg−1 at 640 nm, for the Au-CA 5T sample. These values indicate that SPR of Au NPs in the wavelength range of 400–600 nm significantly contributed to the generation of photocurrent in Au-CA 5T. A control experiment was performed using a clean glassy carbon electrode instead of the Au-CA 5T sample. The findings in Fig. 3d show that the photoeffect of glassy carbon was relatively weak with respect to that of the Au-CA 5T sample. We also measured the methanol electrooxidation performance of the Au-CA 5T catalyst at wavelengths of 468 nm and 640 nm using an LED light source, as shown in Fig. S9.† The MOR peak current for Au-CA 5T underwent a significant increase at a wavelength of 468 nm, which is within the range of the SPR absorption wavelengths, and a small increase in MOR peak current could be observed in the CV test when the irradiation wavelength was 640 nm. These increases in photocurrent and MOR peak current indicate the fast injection of hot electrons from Au NPs to the external circuit, which induced a photocurrent response. Under light irradiation (Fig. 4a), energetic charge carriers are generated on Au NPs by Landau damping of SPR.44–47 When a suitable voltage is applied, hot holes are separated from the charge carriers and utilised for the oxidation of methanol. Subsequently, the hot electrons that are generated are driven to the external circuit and produce photocurrent. In this strategy, the hot charge carriers generated by SPR can be harnessed more efficiently, which benefits the as-prepared Au-CA samples without any internal energy barrier and ensures high catalytic performance in methanol electrooxidation. In order to determine whether or not UV light is the main contributor to the methanol electrooxidation performance of the Au-CA 5T catalyst, CV curves for the Au-CA 5T catalyst were recorded with and without UV light (an LED source with a wavelength of 385 nm) irradiation. As shown in Fig. S10,† UV light had a slight effect on the methanol electrooxidation performance of the Au-CA 5T catalyst, because the methanol electrooxidation performance of the Au-CA catalyst was mainly enhanced by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of Au NPs at a light wavelength of about 400–600 nm.

(a) Scheme of methanol electrooxidation reaction on the Au-CA 5T catalyst irradiated by simulated solar irradiation. (b) Photocurrent response of Au-CA 5T and glassy carbon in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH and 1.5 M CH3OH in an on/off state of simulated solar irradiation. 
The long-term catalytic performance of Au-CA 5T for methanol oxidation was evaluated during switching on/off of light irradiation in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH and 1.5 M CH3OH. Current–time curves for Au-CA 5T and glassy carbon were recorded at 0.28 V (versus MMO), which corresponds to the respective peak oxidation potential of Au-CA 5T for methanol (Fig. 4b). The results show a photocurrent response between the on and off states for Au-CA 5T with respect to the Pt counter electrode during switching on/off of light irradiation, whereas the current during the light on/off cycles exhibited a gradual decrease, which was mainly due to a higher tendency for the accumulation of carbonaceous intermediates that deactivate catalytic sites. This result was consistent with Fig. 2–4 and indicates that SPR of Au NPs in the wavelength range of 400–600 nm significantly contributes to the generation of photocurrent in Au-CA catalysts. Different mechanisms of methanol electrooxidation on Au catalysts have been reported previously. As the potential was swept in a positive direction, a sharp increase in current density at a more positive potential (0.28 V versus MMO) was due to the oxidation of methanol (Fig. 3a–c). Here, methanol was oxidised to carbonates (CO32−) via a six-electron transfer reaction on the basis of the following reaction (1):48,49 CH3OH + 8OH− − 6e− → CO32− + 6H2O(1)
In contrast, at lower potentials the anodic peak was ascribed to the oxidation of methanol to formates via an overall four-electron transfer reaction in accordance with reaction (2) below:50 CH3OH + 5OH− → HCOO− + 6H2O + 4e−(2)
Fig. S11† shows that the methanol electrooxidation activity of Au-CA 5T underwent an obvious decrease in solutions of 1.0 M Na2SO4 and 0.5 M H2SO4 in comparison with that in a solution of 1.0 M KOH. This is consistent with previous findings that the methanol electrooxidation reaction on Au-based catalysts depends on the OH− adsorption ability of the catalysts.37Fig. 5 shows the effects of the methanol concentration and solar light irradiation on the electrooxidation performance of Au-CA 5T in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH. Fig. 5a and c and S12a† show that the anodic peak current increased linearly with methanol concentrations of up to 1.5 M and suggest that the diffusion-controlled process in this system played an important role at methanol concentrations of 0.25–1.5 M. The rate of increase in the anodic peak current decreased as the methanol concentration increased from 2.0 M to 4.0 M, which indicated that the rate of the methanol electrooxidation reaction on Au-CA 5T was consequently dependent on the catalytic reaction between the active sites on the surface of Au NPs and the methanol concentration. Under simulated solar irradiation, the anodic peak currents for Au-CA 5T increased significantly with respect to those in the absence of irradiation (Fig. 5b and S12b†). Fig. 5c shows the statistics for the peak currents in the presence and absence of irradiation for Au-CA 5T at different methanol concentrations. Fig. 5d shows the ratio of the anodic peak currents (with and without irradiation) for Au-CA 5T in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH with different methanol concentrations corresponding to Fig. 5c. Fig. 5c and d reveal that the anodic peak currents for Au-CA 5T under simulated solar irradiation were twice those in the absence of irradiation at methanol concentrations of up to 1.5 M. This result indicates that the electrooxidation of methanol on Au-CA 5T can be enhanced by solar light irradiation, but the real character of the catalysis of methanol electrooxidation is limited by the nature of the catalyst.51
 Fig. 5  Effect of simulated solar irradiation on the methanol electrooxidation performance of Au-CA 5T in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH at various methanol concentrations. CV curves were recorded in the absence (a) and presence (b) of simulated solar irradiation in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH at various methanol concentrations (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 M). (c) Anodic peak current during methanol electrooxidation on Au-CA 5T in the presence and absence of simulated solar irradiation at various methanol concentrations. (d) Ratio of anodic peak currents during methanol electrooxidation on Au-CA 5T in the presence and absence of simulated solar irradiation at various methanol concentrations. The MOR was performed at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 
In addition, the samples of Au-CA prepared with different deposition times and the corresponding effects of solar light irradiation on the anodic peak currents were investigated in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH mixed with 1.5 M CH3OH (Fig. 6). Fig. 6a shows the electrooxidation performance of Au-CA prepared with various deposition times. As shown in Fig. 6a and c, the anodic peak currents increased remarkably for the samples of Au-CA prepared with deposition times of 1T to 6T; however, as the deposition time was increased to 8T, 10T and 12T, the anodic peak currents resumed a downward trend. The results in Fig. 6a suggest that the methanol electrooxidation performance of Au-CA depends on the active sites of the Au NPs. The long-term deposition of Au NPs induces a decrease in specific surface area and hence impairs the MOR performance of Au-CA catalysts. As shown in Fig. 6b, under simulated solar irradiation the anodic peak currents for the Au-CA samples significantly increased with an increase in the deposition time. This obvious increase in anodic peak current confirmed that the catalytic activity of Au-CA for methanol electrooxidation was enhanced by simulated solar irradiation. Fig. 6c shows the statistics for the peak currents in the absence and presence of irradiation, respectively, for the Au-CA samples prepared with various deposition times in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH and 1.5 M CH3OH. Moreover, Fig. 6d shows the ratio of the anodic peak currents (with and without irradiation) for the Au-CA samples prepared with various deposition times corresponding to Fig. 6c. These results indicate that the sample of Au-CA 5T achieved the highest peak current and showed that the performance of Au-CA in the electrooxidation reaction was affected by not only the synthesis conditions but also the absorption of light. Therefore, the large specific area and strong SPR of Au-CA 5T contributed to the increased enhancement of methanol electrooxidation performance under simulated solar irradiation.

(d) Ratio of anodic peak currents during methanol electrooxidation on various Au-CA samples deposited for periods of 1T to 12T in the presence and absence of simulated solar irradiation. The MOR was performed at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in a deoxygenated solution containing 1.0 M KOH and 1.5 M CH3OH. 
The long-term light-enhanced methanol electrooxidation performance of Au-CA catalysts (prepared with various deposition times) was investigated by chronoamperometric tests at an oxidation potential of 0.28 V (versus MMO) for 40 min in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH and 1.5 M CH3OH in the presence and absence of simulated solar irradiation (Fig. 7a and S13†). In general, the current during methanol electrooxidation on traditional catalysts exhibits a gradual decay before reaching a steady state after 20 min. This trend was attributed to the accumulation of intermediate species on the surface of the Au-CA catalysts in this case. From Fig. 7a, under simulated solar irradiation the Au-CA 5T sample exhibited a higher initial current and a slower current decay than those of the Au-CA 5T sample without irradiation. The methanol electrooxidation current density for Au-CA 5T was notably higher in the presence (51.2 μA μg−1) than in the absence (16.5 μA μg−1) of simulated solar irradiation, even after the reaction duration was extended to 40 min. Hence, these results indicated that the light-assisted methanol electrooxidation reaction is more tolerated and stable on Au-CA 5T than on traditional catalysts. This promising property of the MOR current was derived from the strong SPR of Au NPs excited by solar light irradiation in Au-CA 5T and the hole-rich surface of Au NPs, with its strong ability to oxidise methanol and intermediate species. The superior light-enhanced stability of Au-CA prepared with various deposition times for the catalysis of methanol electrooxidation was investigated (Fig. S13†). The methanol electrooxidation current continued to increase under simulated solar irradiation in comparison with that in the dark for the other catalysts, namely, Au-CA 1T, Au-CA 2T, Au-CA 3T, Au-CA 4T, Au-CA 6T, Au-CA 8T, Au-CA 10T and Au-CA 12T.

(b) Statistics for anodic peak current for Au-CA 5T in the dark and under simulated solar irradiation over 500 CV cycles. The measurements of methanol electrooxidation on Au-CA 5T were performed in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH and 1.5 M CH3OH. 
To evaluate the effect of simulated solar irradiation on the operational stability of Au-CA 5T, we performed 500 cycles of CV tests on Au-CA 5T during switching on/off of simulated solar irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7b, the statistics for the anodic peak current indicate that the sample of Au-CA 5T was conventionally stable in the dark during prolonged CV tests, as the peak current decreased by about 8% for a cycle number of 100. After simulated solar irradiation, the anodic peak current and stability of Au-CA 5T increased markedly. The corresponding CV curves are shown in Fig. S8† for the catalytic methanol electrooxidation reaction on Au-CA 5T in a deoxygenated solution of 1.0 M KOH and 1.5 M CH3OH in the absence (Fig. S14a†) and presence (Fig. S14b†) of simulated solar irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7b, the anodic peak current density immediately increased from 116 μA μg−1 to 239 μA μg−1 under simulated solar irradiation because of the SPR effect and increased gradually as the number of cycles increased. The anodic peak current density reached 249.9 μA μg−1 after a further 100 cycles, which was 1.96 times higher than the original current density and indicated that SPR of Au NPs significantly affected the methanol electrooxidation activity and stability of the as-prepared Au-CA 5T. This performance also indicated that the reduction in the anodic peak current in the dark was reversible. Then, after the simulated solar source was turned on and off during 500 cycles of CV tests, the anodic peak current for Au-CA 5T exhibited a decrease of 11.78% with respect to the original current under turned-off solar light. The loss of catalytic activity of Au-CA 5T may have resulted from the removal or clustering of Au NPs. The decrease in anodic peak current in the dark was believed to be due to the adsorption of intermediates (such as methanoic acid, methanol or CO produced by the electrooxidation of methanol) on the surface of Au. These intermediates were adsorbed on the surface of the Au NPs, covered the active sites of the catalyst continuously, and hence decreased the MOR catalytic activity. Under simulated solar light irradiation, the MOR catalytic activity of Au-CA 5T was improved by the SPR-induced separation of hot carriers, which also significantly affected the stability for methanol electrooxidation. In contrast, although hot electrons can be generated by the decay of SPR and delivered to the external circuit to increase the photocurrent, the hole-rich surface of Au NPs retains a strong ability to oxidise both methanol and the intermediates. Therefore, the intermediates adsorbed on the Au NPs were further oxidised much more easily under solar light irradiation, which resulted in the release of covered active sites. This so-called self-cleaning property can recover the activity of Au NPs under simulated solar irradiation and cause a gradual increase in current.52
Conclusions
In summary, we synthesised Au-CA by a simple ion sputtering method. The mean sizes of the Au NPs and the morphology of the Au-CA samples were controlled by varying the deposition time from 1T to 12T. The mechanism of the effect of light on the catalytic activity of Au-CA for methanol electrooxidation was studied using diffuse reflectance UV-vis absorption and photocurrent response, and the electronic structure of Au-CA was determined by XPS. Moreover, a broad SPR absorption peak of the Au NPs appeared at a wavelength of 515 nm, and the photocurrent density of 175.8 μA μg−1 at an irradiation wavelength of 468 nm was 2.5 times higher than the value of 70.2 μA μg−1 at 640 nm for the Au-CA 5T sample. Moreover, with respect to bulk Au, the electronic structure of Au-CA 5T exhibited no obvious change under irradiation. As a result, the Au-CA sample prepared with the deposition time of 5T displayed the greatest enhancements in electrocatalytic activity and anti-CO poisoning ability for methanol electrooxidation under simulated solar irradiation because of the SPR-induced separation of charge carriers and the increased number of preoxidised species on the Au surface. The SPR-induced enhancement in catalytic activity and stability for the methanol electrooxidation reaction on the as-prepared Au-CA 5T catalyst provides a promising technology for DMFCs.
