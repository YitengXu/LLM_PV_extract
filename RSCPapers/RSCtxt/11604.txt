    , Accepted 2nd August 2012First published on 3rd August 2012AbstractA non-fused ring building block of an electron-rich quinoid structure, 2,5-thienoquinodimethane, has been synthesized and used in the synthesis of novel donor (D)–acceptor (A) type low bandgap polymers for the first time. Namely, 2,5-thienoquinodimethane with 4-(tert-butyl)phenyl or 4-(octyloxy)phenyl side chain as a solubilizing group was copolymerized with an electron-deficient diketopyrrolopyrrole subunit (PQD1 and PQD2, respectively). These polymer films exhibited broad and intense absorption bands in the region of 400–1000 nm. Photovoltaic devices with active layers consisting of PQD1 or PQD2 with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM) revealed a broad photoresponse range covering from 400 to 1000 nm, whereas the power conversion efficiencies (η) were found to be moderate (1.44% for PQD1 and 0.96% for PQD2) under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. The superior η value of the PQD1:[70]PCBM-based device relative to the PQD2:[70]PCBM-based device can be attributed to the more favorable phase separation nanostructure in the active layer as well as the higher crystallinity of PQD1 than PQD2. These results provide valuable, basic guidelines for rational designs of quinoidal heterole-based low bandgap polymers for high performance organic solar cells.
1. Introduction
Polymer-based organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have stimulated broad interest due to their potential advantages such as facile fabrication, low cost, lightweight, and flexibility.1 On the basis of the concept of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure, where electron donor and acceptor materials form bicontinuous phase separation structures with tens of nanometer-sized domains, OPVs made by blending poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM) as an acceptor have been intensively investigated, leading to power conversion efficiencies (η) of up to 4–5%.2 However, the η values of P3HT-based OPVs were mainly limited by their narrow absorption spectra ranging from 300–650 nm. Therefore, low bandgap polymers are highly desirable to serve as donors of the active layers in OPVs aiming at matching their absorptions well with the solar radiation spectrum.1 The key requirements for the low bandgap polymers in [60]PCBM-based OPVs are appropriate HOMO (∼−5.4 eV) and LUMO (∼−3.9 eV) energy levels for broad light-harvesting, efficient charge separation, and high open circuit voltage.1,3 The balanced crystallinity and solubility of the polymers are also of significance for high hole mobility and optimal film morphology.1a
Synthesis of low bandgap polymers can date back to 1984, when poly(isothianaphthene) (PITN) with a bandgap as low as 1.0 eV was synthesized by electrochemical polymerization and chemical oxidation methods.4 The main chain of PITN favors quinoid resonance forms to preserve the benzene aromaticity at the expense of the thiophene aromaticity, which endows a planar and rigid polymer backbone with an extensively delocalized π-conjugation system. However, the poor solubility of PITN in common organic solvents resulted in low processability and thus hindered the device applications. Following the synthesis of PITN, poly(arylene-methine)s (PAMs) combining heteroquinodimethane and heteroaromatic units in the main chain were prepared through the acid-catalyzed polycondensation reactions between heteroaromatic compounds and aldehydes and subsequent oxidations.5–10 Although this approach yielded poly((oligo)thienylene-methine)s,5,6 poly(ITN-methine)s,7,8 and poly(pyrrolylene-methine)s9 with a low bandgap of ∼1.2 eV, these polymers suffered from irregularly linked heteroaromatic units and contamination of residual oxidants. In addition, the number-average molecular weights were found to be typically less than 5000. Thus, the material applications of PAMs in optical and electrical devices such as OPVs and organic field-effect transistors have never been reported so far.
Recently, a facile method to afford low bandgap polymers by combining electron-rich (donor) and electron-deficient (acceptor) moieties in their repeating units has been extensively explored.1 Such internal donor (D)–acceptor (A) structures can also enhance charge carrier mobility due to the reduced interchain π–π stacking distance.11 In this regard, a number of electron-rich units including cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene,12 dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole,13 and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene14 as well as electron-deficient units including ester- or ketone-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene,15 diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP),16 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole,17 and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione18 have been developed. It should be pointed out that all these units are fused aromatic rings, which exhibit more rigid and planar structures than monocyclic aromatic rings, thereby leading to a decreased chain-folding, enhanced intermolecular stacking, and increased effective π conjugation length. So far, a combination of electron-rich benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and electron-deficient thieno[3,4-b]thiophene has led to one of the highest η values of 7–8%.15 In addition to the D–A intramolecular interaction, conjugated polymers containing thieno[3,4-b]thiophene units in the main chain tend to possess low bandgaps because their main chains favor quinoid forms to preserve the fused thiophene aromaticity at the expense of the aromaticity of thiophene in the main chain, which is in analogy with ITN-based polymers.4
On the other hand, Jenekhe and Chen reported the synthesis of quinoid thiophene oligomers (i.e., monomer to trimer) as model compounds of PAMs.19 These compounds exhibited high planarity and efficient π-electron delocalization with absorption maxima of 480–676 nm. Moreover, the bandgap and ionization potential decreased with the increasing length of the quinoid oligomer.19 Therefore, these electron-rich quinoidal thiophene units can be regarded as one of the highly promising building blocks for D–A conjugated polymers with tunable bandgap and HOMO energy levels. Although the incorporation of quinoidal structures is a versatile approach for the creation of novel low bandgap polymers as well as the utilization of the fused-ring structures, metal-catalyzed polycondensation using difunctionalized quinoid compounds has yet to be reported so far.
Herein we report on the first synthesis of D–A type conjugated polymers (PQD1, 2) containing quinoidal thiophene units as electron-rich moieties in the polymer for OPVs. 2,5-Thienoquinodimethane19 with 5-trimethylstannyl-2-thienyl groups at both methylene carbons (compound 3) was prepared via1 and 2 and then used for copolymerization by Stille coupling reaction (Scheme 1). DPP unit with two 2-ethylhexyl chains at N-atoms (compound 4)16 was chosen as the A unit, as it has strong electron-withdrawing properties, rigid coplanar structure, and sufficient solubility. The resulting polymers, PQDs, are expected to possess relatively narrow bandgaps due to the highly conjugated quinoidal thiophene units as well as D–A interactions in the main chain. Phenyl groups with bulky tert-butyl or long, electron-donating octyloxy groups were introduced at methine carbons next to the quinoidal thiophene to improve the solubility of the polymers in organic solvents. In contrast to the acid-catalyzed polymerization,5–10 this metal-catalyzed conventional polymerization method is potentially free from contaminations of the residual oxidant and irregularly linked thiophenes, as they can be removed by careful monomer purifications. The characterizations and thermal, optical, and photovoltaic properties of PQDs are described in this report. Furthermore, the relationship between OPV device performances and nanostructured phase separations in the active layer is also discussed.

2.4. Polymer synthesis

2.4.1. 
            PQD1
          . 
A test tube was charged with 3a (43 mg, 0.050 mmol), 4 (34 mg, 0.050 mmol), Pd2dba3 (dba = dibenzylideneacetone) (2.3 mg, 0.0025 mmol), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (8.8 mg, 0.029 mmol) and anhydrous chlorobenzene (1 mL), and bubbled with argon for 10 min. The reaction mixture was stirred at 170 °C for 18 h with a microwave reactor. The cooled mixture was subsequently poured into methanol and the black precipitate was collected on a membrane filter.

          . 
Polymer PQD2 was synthesized following the same procedure for PQD1. The product was washed with methanol and hexane, and purified by reprecipitation with chloroform/methanol. Yield 19 mg (32%). 1H NMR δH (400 MHz, CDCl3; Me4Si): 7.6–6.8 (aromatic, 16H), 6.6–6.3 (quinoid, 2H), 4.1–3.9 (OCH2, NCH2, 8H), 1.9 (NCH2CH, 2H), 1.83 (OCH2CH2, 4H), 1.5–1.2 (CH2, 36H), 0.8–0.9 (CH3, 18H).

2.5. Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells
The OPV devices were fabricated as follows.21 Indium tin oxide (ITO) on a glass substrate with a sheet resistance of 5 Ω sq−1 (Geomatec) was used. The substrates were sonicated consecutively with acetone and ethanol for 15 min. After blow-drying and UV-ozone treatment, the substrates were spin coated at 4000 rpm with poly(ethylene dioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P VP AI 4083) and dried with a hot plate at 200 °C for 10 min. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, an active layer of polymer:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester ([70]PCBM) (American Dye Source, Inc.) film was formed by spin coating a chlorobenzene solution of polymer:[70]PCBM (1:2 (w/w), [polymer] = 15 mg mL−1, [[70]PCBM] = 30 mg mL−1) at 4000 rpm for 1 min onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS. The thicknesses of the PQD1:[70]PCBM and PQD2:[70]PCBM films were estimated to be 70 and 68 nm, respectively, by AFM measurements. Then, a TiOx layer was prepared by spin coating an ethanol solution of titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) at 2000 rpm, and then leaving for 30 min under ambient atmosphere. The titanium(IV) isopropoxide was hydrolyzed to yield the TiOx layer. Finally, an Al (The Nilaco Corporation) layer was deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum (5 × 10−5 Pa) to yield the layered device structure (denoted as ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:[70]PCBM/TiOx/Al). Schematic illustrations of the top and side views of the device are depicted in Fig. S3 (see ESI†). Photocurrent–voltage characteristics were measured under ambient atmosphere and simulated solar light, air mass (AM) 1.5 (100 mW cm−2).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Monomers and polymers synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic routes to the comonomer compounds 3a, 3b and the polymers PQD1, PQD2 are shown in Scheme 1. The crude precursors 1a with 4-(tert-butyl)phenyl and 1b with 4-(octyloxy)phenyl groups were obtained by the reaction between 2,5-dilithiothiophene and the corresponding phenyl thienyl ketone. Subsequent reactions with HI/Na2S2O4 converted the precursors to the corresponding conjugated quinoid compounds 2a and 2b.19 The quinoid compounds are likely to contain three diastereomers, i.e., E,E, E,Z, and Z,Z isomers. However, the difficulty in the separation forced us to use 2a and 2b as mixtures of diastereomers for the following step of distannylation, yielding the quinoidal thiophene comonomers 3a and 3b as E,E, E,Z, and Z,Z mixtures. The compounds 3a and 3b were copolymerized with DPP comonomer 4 bearing two 2-ethylhexyl chains at N-atoms through Stille coupling reactions to afford the target polymers PQD1 and PQD2 with 4-(tert-butyl)phenyl and 4-(octyloxy)phenyl groups as solubilizing substituents, respectively. The polymers were obtained as a dark blue solid and purified by repeated reprecipitation with chloroform/methanol. The polymers PQD1 and PQD2 showed excellent solubility in common organic solvents such as toluene, chloroform, and chlorobenzene, which permits the polymers to be readily processed by a solution technique for the film formation. The structural irregularity, i.e., coexistence of E,E, E,Z, and Z,Z isomers in the main chain, as well as solubilizing side chains may contribute to the high solubility. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) were estimated to be 4700 and 1.5 for PQD1 and 8200 and 2.5 for PQD2, respectively, by GPC measurements with polystyrene standards in chloroform. Different reaction conditions such as conventional heating using oil baths, catalysts (Pd(PPh3)4, PdCl2(PPh3)3, and (C6H5CN)2PdCl2), and solvents (o-dichlorobenzene, toluene, and DMF) resulted in lower molecular weights. The reason for the relatively low molecular weight of PQD1 and PQD2 is currently unclear, but an insufficient purity of the quinoid and/or DPP monomers may be responsible for the low Mn value.22 It is noteworthy that both solid and solution samples of PQD1 and PQD2 were stable in air for more than several months in ambient atmosphere.
The thermal stabilities of PQD1 and PQD2 were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Both polymers were thermally stable with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of 387 and 399 °C for PQD1 and PQD2, respectively, in nitrogen atmosphere. The high-thermal stabilities of the obtained polymers are beneficial for their application in the active layers of OPVs. On the other hand, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) did not display any transition temperatures such as glass transition or melting up to 350 °C, implying that these polymers are thermally robust.
3.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of the copolymers were investigated by visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) absorption spectra in diluted chlorobenzene solutions and film states spin-coated on glass substrates (Fig. 1). The optical data of the polymers are listed in Table 1. The chlorobenzene solutions of PQD1 and PQD2 showed broad absorption bands in visible and NIR regions with maximum absorption peaks at 734 and 686 nm, respectively, due to the π–π* transitions. These broad absorption features are similar to other polymers based on DPP and electron-rich fused-ring units.16 Despite the lower molecular weight of PQD1 than that of PQD2, the absorption band of PDQ1 in chlorobenzene is red-shifted compared with PQD2. This may result from the lower solubility of PQD1 than that of PQD2 due to the short side chains at phenyl groups, i.e., tert-butyl group, which would induce a certain degree of packing even in the diluted chlorobenzene solution. Consistently, a cast film of PQD1 displayed an absorption band with a peak at 733 nm that is comparable to that in chlorobenzene, whereas the PQD2 film exhibited significant bathochromic shifts relative to the solution samples. This red shift can be attributed to the more aggregated configuration formed in the solid state. The edges of the film absorption bands for PQD1 and PQD2 were 1030 and 1000 nm, respectively, both of which correspond to optical bandgaps of ca. 1.2 eV. Meanwhile, measurements of steady-state fluorescence spectra of the polymers revealed no detectable emissions in visible and NIR regions. Besides, the fluorescence lifetime measurements in the same region did not display any decay components. These results indicate the occurrence of the ultrafast nonradiative vibrational relaxation of the polymer excited state to the ground state as well as the possibilities for quenching by defect sites and residual impurities in the polymer samples, which are beyond the time resolution of the measurement system (<80 ps).

Cyclic voltammetry measurements of PQD1 and PQD2 films on ITO electrodes were also performed in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M n-Bu4N+PF6− as a supporting electrolyte (Fig. S4, see ESI†). Although both polymers showed oxidation peaks, the onsets of the oxidation signals were not evident, making it difficult to estimate the HOMO energy levels from the voltammograms.23 Conversely, the HOMO energy levels of PQD1 and PQD2 were determined to be −5.2 and −4.9 eV by using photoemission yield spectroscopy in air (PYSA, Fig. 2).24 The electron-donating feature of octyloxy groups raised the HOMO level of PQD2 considerably compared to that of PQD1. The LUMO levels were estimated to be −4.0 and −3.7 eV for PQD1 and PQD2, respectively, by adding the thin-film optical bandgap to the HOMO level.24,25 The energy levels of PQD1, PQD2, [70]PCBM, buffer layers, and electrodes used in the OPV devices (vide infra) are illustrated in Fig. 3.21 As it has been well recognized that the binding energy of the excitons is ca. 0.3–0.5 eV, the LUMO energy level of the donor must be positioned above that of the acceptor (i.e., [70]PCBM) by 0.3–0.5 eV to ensure an efficient photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from the donor excited state to the acceptor.1 Thus, the driving force for electron transfer from the PQD1 excited state to [70]PCBM is slightly insufficient, whereas that from the PQD2 excited state to [70]PCBM is sufficient for efficient ET.

3.3. Photovoltaic properties
To examine the photovoltaic properties of the polymers, OPV devices with a sandwich configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:[70]PCBM/TiOx/Al, where the active layer is placed between the hole transport (PEDOT:PSS) and hole blocking (TiOx) layers, were fabricated (Fig. S3†). The active layers of PQD1:[70]PCBM and PQD2:[70]PCBM were spin-coated from the chlorobenzene solutions (1:2 (w/w)). [70]PCBM was chosen as the electron acceptor instead of [60]PCBM, because [70]PCBM possesses electronic properties similar to [60]PCBM, but a considerably higher absorption coefficient in the visible region of 400–600 nm, which complements the absorption of low bandgap polymers.26Fig. 4 depicts the current–voltage characteristics of the OPV devices under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. The OPV device based on the PQD1:[70]PCBM layer demonstrated a η value of 1.44% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.53 V, short circuit current density (JSC) of 6.58 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.42, which are superior to those of the PQD2:[70]PCBM-based device (η = 0.96%, JSC = 5.58 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.45 V, FF = 0.41) (Table 2). The difference between HOMO of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor is known to influence the VOC value.5 The high HOMO level of PQD2 relative to PQD1 (Fig. 3) due to the introduction of the electron-donating octyloxy groups led to the lower VOC value of the PQD2 device (0.45 V) than the PQD1 device (0.53 V). It should be noted here that the VOC value of the PQD1 device is still inferior to those of the devices consisting of other DPP-based conjugated polymers,16 reflecting the strong electron-donating feature of 2,5-thienoquinodimethane units.19 Meanwhile, the JSC and FF values of both the PQD1:[70]PCBM- and PQD2:[70]PCBM-based devices were also lower than those of the reported OPV devices.12–18 Considering that the film thicknesses and absorption intensities of the PQD1:[70]PCBM and PQD2:[70]PCBM films are comparable to those of the active layers in the reported OPV devices,27 the poor JSC values may result from inefficient charge separation and charge transport. A plausible reason for the poor charge separation efficiency is the ultrafast nonradiative vibrational relaxation of the polymer excited state to the ground state, which are experimentally validated by fluorescence lifetime measurements (vide supra). In addition, the low FF values may be due to poor charge collection efficiency at the interface between the polymer:[70]PCBM and TiOx/Al.28

The photocurrent action spectra of both the PQD1:[70]PCBM- and PQD2:[70]PCBM-based devices displayed a wide range of photocurrent generation in visible and NIR regions up to 1000 nm (Fig. 5), reflecting the broad absorption band of the polymers (Fig. 6). It should be emphasized here that the incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCE) of the PQD1:[70]PCBM-based device in the 400–600 nm region are high compared to those in the longer wavelength region (600–1000 nm), which does not match the feature of the absorption spectrum. In contrast, the IPCE profile for the PQD2:[70]PCBM-based device is largely similar to the corresponding absorption spectrum. These results indicate that the absorption of PQD1 makes less contribution to the photocurrent generation than that of [70]PCBM owing to the insufficient driving force for the photoinduced ET from the PQD1 excited state to [70]PCBM. This is consistent with the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers estimated with PYSA and optical bandgaps (Fig. 3). The higher IPCE values of the PQD1:[70]PCBM-based device in the region of the [70]PCBM absorption rendered a JSC value higher than that of the PQD2:[70]PCBM-based device. The results of photocurrent action spectra provide guidelines to improve the JSC values, i.e., for the high efficiency of ET from the excited state of the polymer to [70]PCBM, electron-donating side groups such as alkoxyphenyls should be attached to the polymer main chains.

3.4. Film structures
To shed light on the relationship between the film nanostructure and the device performances, the surface morphologies of the active layers were evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 7). Although both composite films showed grain patterns with tens of nanometer sizes at surfaces, the PQD2:[70]PCBM thin film exhibited a larger root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 0.76 nm than that of the PQD1:[70]PCBM film (RMS = 0.45 nm). This result indicates the occurrence of an unfavorably large nano-scale phase separation in the PQD2:[70]PCBM layer, lowering the charge separation efficiency at the polymer–[70]PCBM interface.1 In addition, poor electrical communication at the interface between the PQD2:[70]PCBM layer and electrodes (i.e., TiOx/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS) as a result of the rough surface structure may lead to inferior device performance. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the polymer films drop-cast from the chlorobenzene solutions were also conducted to assess the bulk morphology of the polymers. Fig. 8 and S5 (see ESI†) provide the out-of-plane and in-plane XRD patterns of the thin films of PQD1 and PQD2. The PQD1 film exhibited a peak at 2θ = 4.6° (Fig. 8), which can be assigned to the polymer lamellar sheet with an inter-polymer distance of 19 Å. A similar result was obtained for the in-plane XRD profile (Fig. S3†), indicating that there is no preferential orientation of the lamellar sheet in PQD1 relative to the substrate. On the other hand, the PQD2 film showed no obvious signals in both profiles, suggesting that the polymer is almost amorphous. The more irregular alignment of PQD2 may inhibit the efficient charge transport, resulting in inferior device performances despite the sufficient driving force of electron transfer from the polymer to [70]PCBM. It is noteworthy that signals of π–π stacking crystallinity of the PQD1 and PQD2 polymer backbone were absent in both out-of-plane and in-plane profiles (Fig. 8 and Fig. S5†). This is in sharp contrast to the highly crystalline P3HT that displays a peak arising from π–π stacking with a spacing of ∼3.8 Å in the in-plane XRD patterns, suggesting the edge-on configuration of the P3HT film.2 These results indicate that the π–π stacking crystallinity of the PQD1 and PQD2 backbone is insufficient to induce the corresponding XRD peak, and the low crystallinity may lead to low charge transport efficiencies and JSC values in comparison with other recently reported devices.2,12–19

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized donor–acceptor type low bandgap polymers containing quinoidal thiophene as a novel non-fused donor unit and DPP as an acceptor unit for the first time (PQD1 and PQD2 with 4-(tert-butyl)phenyl and 4-(octyloxy)phenyl side chains, respectively). The polymers exhibited broad and intense absorption bands in visible and NIR regions. The devices with the polymer:[70]PCBM active layer showed a wide range of photocurrent generation in the region of 400–1000 nm, whereas the η values were found to be moderate (1.44% for PQD1 and 0.96% fro PQD2). The superior η value of the PQD1-based device relative to the PQD2-based device can be attributed to the more favorable nanostructure of the phase separation between PQD1 and [70]PCBM as well as the higher crystallinity of PQD1. Although these η values are lower than those on the state-of-the-art OPV devices, we believe that the OPV device performance with this novel type of copolymer can be further improved by modulating the side-chain structures29 and molecular weights30 of the polymers to induce more efficient polymer–polymer interactions. Optimization of the film structures by thermal annealing or the use of solvent additives31 may also lead to improvements in device performances. These results obtained here demonstrate that heteroquinodimethane structures are promising, simple, and versatile comonomer building blocks for photoactive materials in polymer bulk heterojunction OPV applications.

Because the reduction onsets of PQD1 and PQD2 films were relatively evident in the cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S2†), the LUMO energy levels could be calculated to be −3.9 and −3.7 eV, respectively, both of which are comparable to the values obtained by PYSA measurements and optical bandgaps (Table 1).
