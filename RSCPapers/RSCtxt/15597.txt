First published on 15th July 2013AbstractThis review highlights some of the advances that have been made in the study of donor–acceptor interactions and their applications in the construction of functional supramolecular architectures in 2012. The review is organised into three broad sections encompassing light-harvesting photovoltaics, donor–acceptor co-polymers and mechanically interlocked molecules.
Introduction
The stacking arrangements observed between π-rich (donor) and π-deficient (acceptor) aromatic molecules have been extensively used in the construction of molecular scaffolds. The interaction between such π systems is termed donor–acceptor, and it represents a specific form of the more general π–π interactions, and it concerns π-systems that are π-rich or π-deficient due to molecular polarisation.
In 2012, research groups around the world have put forward many advances in the areas of organic photovoltaics, light-harvesting arrays, mechanically interlocked molecules and self-assembled systems in general. Energy transfer through anion binding and donor–acceptor interactions involving nano-carbon materials have been reviewed recently.1–3
Light harvesting photovoltaics
Photophysical studies of biomimetic systems have provided key insights into the mechanisms of energy and electron transfer in natural photosynthesis and have driven the development of supramolecular systems for the production of artificial photosynthesis. Organisation of dye assemblies by non-covalent interactions governs the fast migration of excitation energy by which energy transfer can occur.4–9
The natural chlorophyll has tuneable electronic and redox properties that allow it to absorb light across a broad range of wavelengths with the ability to act as both an electron donor and acceptor. Semisynthetic chlorophyll-based systems have been shown to undergo efficient electron transfer once photoinduced.10,11 Wasielewski and co-workers have previously reported use of zinc methyl 3-ethylpyrochlorophyllide (Ch1) functionalised at the 20-position to generate a series of donor–acceptor dyads with naphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide) (‘napthalenediimide’, NDI) or perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (‘perylenediimide’, PDI) as the electron acceptors.12 These systems showed ultrafast electron transfer upon photoexcitation in both polar (τCS = 13–19 ps) and non-polar solvents (τCR = 12–25 ps). However the charge recombination was too rapid in polar (τCR = 25–43 ps) and non-polar (τCR = 1.2–3.3 ns) solvents for applications in artificial photosynthesis, where a slower diffusional time scale is required.
To slow down the charge recombination, work has been undertaken towards the formation of self-assembling supramolecular structures that better replicate bacteriochlorophyll.13–15 Ch1 exhibits metal–ligand coordination, hydrogen bonding, π–π interactions and hydrophobic effects within the protein environment that enables it to form supramolecular assemblies.16 So, appending a pyridyl functionalised pyromellitimide-naphthalenediimide (PI-NDI) dyad at the 20-position of Ch1 allows the creation of discrete supramolecular Ch1 systems. The incorporation of a coordinating pyridine ligand into the triad facilitates supramolecular assembly through metal–ligand coordination. This has led to the formation of cyclic tetramers (molecular boxes) when dissolved in dry toluene. Wasielewski's groups has synthesised a range of Ch1-donor–acceptor triads (Fig. 1) in order to determine how self-assembly governs the photoinduced charge separation of the systems.
 Fig. 1  Donor–acceptor triad structures. 
Photophysical studies were used to probe each supramolecular system in order to understand the excitation energy transfer (EET). The studies show that the supramolecular assembly influences the charge transfer dynamics of the system. Cyclic tetramers of Ch1-PI-NDI and Ch1-PI-NDI2 triads increase the overall charge separation lifetimes and, by controlling the supramolecular aggregation, the charge transfer dynamics of the system can then be tailored.16
Supramolecular self-assembly of low-molecular-mass gelators (LMMG) through dipole–dipole, hydrogen-bonding, van der Waals and π–π interactions has produced physical gels whose properties make them ideal for energy transfer. Samanta and Bhattacharya have demonstrated supramolecular self-assembly between two organogelators based on a central tri(p-phenylene vinylene) (TPV) unit through hydrogen bonding (Fig. 2).17

Energy transfer between donor (D) and acceptor (A) was observed using UV/vis spectroscopy in n-heptane at 1 × 10−5 M where an overlap between the emission band of D (λmax = 457 nm with shoulder at λmax = 484 nm) and the acceptor band of A (λmax = 448 nm) was evident. This was further supported when a 1:1 mixture of D and A, excited at λ = 380 nm, showed a sharp decrease in the fluorescence emission at λ = 457 nm (D) and an increase at λ = 512 nm (A), which is indicative of energy transfer from D to A rather than direct excitation of A.
The authors also demonstrated that a successful transfer array can be constructed from a range of donors and acceptors coupled with TPV chromophores. Cascade energy transfer was observed when assorted chromophore assemblies of the four different luminescent compounds (anthracene N, D, A and rhodamine 6G R) (Fig. 2) were mixed. The energy transfer was identified by the stepwise addition of each individual chromophore. Initial excitation of N at λ = 356 nm shows an emission maxima at λ = 400 nm; subsequent addition of D showed quenching of the band at λ = 400 nm and new emission maxima at λ = 461 and 486 nm. The mixture of N + D + A showed an emission maximum at λ = 518 nm and the final mixture of all four chromophores showed a final emission maximum at λ = 565 nm which is characteristic of R, thus indicating that upon addition of each new chromophore, energy transfer between the donor and acceptor occurs to the higher wavelength and thus providing a successful light harvesting array.17
Ramamurthy and co-workers have demonstrated photoinduced electron transfer between a encapsulated coumarin 153 (C153) and free 4,4′-dimethyl viologen dichloride (MV2+) or N-methylpyridinium (PV+) in water (Fig. 3). Electron transfer between donor and acceptor occurs, despite lack of solvent within the capsule, and despite the organic wall of the host.18

The ultrafast electron transfer was studied by exciting encapsulated C153 with femtosecond laser pulses (λex = 390 nm, pulse width = 150 fs). The fluorescence of the incarcerated C153 (λ = 480 nm) was quenched by the addition of free MV2+. Femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy was used to quantify the quenching phenomena by studying intermediates of the encapsulated C153 and the free MV2+ from their transient spectra. In the spectra, the laser-induced fluorescence of the 1C153* excited state and the absorption of the radical cation MV+˙ were observed, with the formation of this radical cation confirming electron transfer from C153 to MV2+.18
Müllen and co-workers have constructed organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) from the supramolecular aggregation of donor–acceptor dyads.19 The authors report the solvent induced precipitation of a 9-[5,8,11,14,17-penta(3,7-dimethyl-octyl)-hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronen-2-yl]-N-(2,6-di-iso-propyl-phenyl)-perylene-3,4-di-carboxiimide (HBC-PMI20) (Fig. 4) from isopropanol.

These self-assembled fibres were integrated into a bottom-contact FET and, using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM), the mobility of the charge carriers following light illumination was monitored. It was shown that the fibrous materials exhibit both higher responsivity (which is a measure of the device's ability to convert incident light intensity into an electric current) and photosensitivity (the increase in signal upon illumination) than conventional film organic phototransistors. The FET configuration, where the current through the junction can be modulated by both photoexcitation and gate control, was also shown to be turned “on” much more efficiently using light than by field-effect.19
Ultrafast charge separation has been demonstrated to occur between graphene layers that act as an electron acceptor, and tetrapyrrole moieties as photosensitizer donors. D'Souza and co-workers have produced graphene–phthalocyanine hybrids that stack through non-covalent π–π interactions, and which exhibit an energy transfer process.21
A π-stacking interaction of graphene layers with tetrapyrroles was identified following suspension of graphene flakes in a solution of the donors in o-dichlorobenzene (Fig. 5). This resulted in the fluorescence spectrum of 1 being quenched by 80% (λ = 722 nm) and that of the donor 2 by 70% (λ = 600 and 648 nm) indicating excited state events. Subsequent femtosecond absorption techniques applied to these hybrids 1·3 and 2·3 identified charge separation, the kinetics of which were of the order of 1011–1012 s−1, showing ultrafast separation. These results suggest that donor–acceptor hybrids with graphene could be used for light energy harvesting devices.21

Continuing the theme of carbon-based donor–acceptor systems, co-crystallisation of fullerene and coronene derivatives (Fig. 6) resulted in a layer structure that can be used in photovoltaic devices. The Nuckolls group has previously reported such systems22–24 with co-crystals forming at the interface of the two materials accounting for the device performance. In a more recent article they report the solution based self-assembly of these two compounds that are hypothesised to create an active layer for solar cells. The self-organisation of the two organic semi-conductors (6-DBTTC and phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester) into films has been shown to result in activity in photovoltaic devices, giving high open circuit voltages (VOC) and power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 2.7%.
 Fig. 6  Chemical structure of 6-DBTTC and PC70BM. 
Self-assembly of the two molecules was inferred from the photoluminescence spectrum, which showed fluorescence quenching of 6-DBTTC (λ = 518 nm) by PC70BM. Spin casting of a 1:2 mixture (6-DBTTC:PC70BM) allowed the mixtures to be incorporated as a layer into a photovoltaic device (Fig. 7). At a ratio of 1:2 the PCE goes through a maximum of 2.66% and the Voc is 0.92 V.25

Torres and co-workers have reported similar donor–acceptor systems incorporating azulenocyanines and C60 fullerene derivatives. The combination of fullerene with phthalocyanine as electron donor has yielded promising photoactive materials both as both covalent conjugates and as non-covalent hybrids. They have described the synthesis of a non-covalent donor–acceptor system of Zn–azulenocyanine (2) with N-pyridylfullerolidine (1), held through metal–ligand interactions. They also reported a similar covalent donor–acceptor system using azulenecyanine–C60 having a comparable set of substituents (3, Fig. 8).

The non-covalent pair of 1·2 was shown to exhibit a radical ion pair state (lifetime = 0.78 ns) due to the strong axial σ-bonding and moderate π-back bonding. This allows good communication between the excited state of the donor and the ground state of the electron acceptor. This however fails for the covalent moiety 3 as the azulenocyanine centred excited state fails to power electron transfer between the donor and acceptor.26
The axial coordination of phenylimidazole-functionalised fulleropyrrolidine to zinc phthalocyanine, as a donor–acceptor polyad assembly, was reported by D'Souza's group in an attempt to produce an energy relay molecule (Fig. 9). The tetracarbazole modified zinc phthalocyanine acts as a donor so that electron transfer from the singlet excited state of the phthalocyanine to the fullerene acceptor occurs.

Fluorescence studies showed that the peaks for the zinc phthalocyanine moiety of the donor were red shifted by 12 nm (λ = 349, 624 and 691) compared with the unsubstituted starting material, with the absorption maxima of the carbazole moieties appearing at 295 nm and a broad band (λ = 478 nm) indicating intramolecular interactions of the carbazole with the phthalocyanine π-system. The axial coordination of the functionalised fulleropyrrolidine (C60Im) to the zinc acceptor resulted in blue-shifted absorption bands as well as isosbestic points at 501, 630 and 700 nm implying equilibrium in the binding process of the donor–acceptor.
Cyclic voltammetry identified the radical ion pair ZnPc˙+–ImC60˙− in which the electron transfer was calculated to be ERIP = 1.29 eV, which represents the energy for one electron to transfer from the central zinc phthalocyanine to the C60 entity. The ability of the donor–acceptor array to harvest light energy was probed by constructing photoelectrical chemical cells. The polyad was electrophoretically deposited onto fluorine-doped nanocrystalline SnO2. The PCE of this material was found to be >7% (λ = 700 nm), while the short circuit current (ISC) ranged between 0.3–1.4 mA cm−2 and the VOC was around 0.2 V. These calculations show that the solar cell constructed from the dyad and SnO2 shows high light energy conversion efficiency, ideal for progress into artificial photosynthesis.27
Donor–acceptor co-polymers
The highlights of D–A supramolecular polymers in 2012 include self-healable materials, organic photovoltaics and OFETs that take advantage of the properties of donor–acceptor chemistry, such as charge transport and reversible formation.
Recently ‘smart’ or self-healable materials have received considerable interest due to their obvious advantages over conventional materials, and supramolecular strategies have often been implemented in their production. While these approaches achieve high healing efficiencies, they often yield mechanically weak materials due to the weakness of the non-covalent interactions that form the polymer itself. Fox's group has reported a system that builds on their earlier work on self-healable polymers and that overcomes the weakness issue of their previous system.28 The group combined polynaphthalenediimide and pyrenyl capped polymers to form a supramolecular material that could be healed by mild heating with the addition of a reinforcing filler of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) to form a high strength, healable, supramolecular polymer nanocomposite.29
The polymer blend shown in Fig. 10 was made in films from 6:1 CHCl3:hexafluoro-propan-2-ol followed by re-dissolution in DMF and mixing with different weight percentages (1.25–10%) of CNC dispersed in DMF. The addition of increasing amounts of CNC increased the tensile strength of the material in comparison with that of the non-CNC polymer; up to 40 fold for the 10 wt% CNC (8 MPa for 0% vs. 341 MPa for 10% CNC). The nanocomposites were all thermally responsive and able to regain their pristine tensile moduli. However the rate of healing decreased with increasing CNC: 1.25–2.5% within 1 minute, 5% within 5 minutes while 7.5% took 80 minutes (all healings at 65 °C). Samples with more than 7.5% CNC samples showed phase separation which impacted on the performance of the films.29

Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been developed as an alternative to inorganic solar cells; they use bulk hetero junctions containing conjugated polymers as donors and fullerenes as acceptors. The most promising PSCs are those consisting of both p-type (donor) and n-type (acceptor) materials to maximise the internal donor–acceptor interfacial area. Further developments in this area include use of benzotrithiophene (BTT) based copolymers, and all-carbon copolymers. A common theme in all these polymers is the use of long alkyl chains that are directly appended to the aromatic groups, which not only allows the solubilisation of the polymer, but also increases the order within the bulk polymer due to van der Waals forces-driven arrangement of the side chains. The Polydispersity Index (PDI) in nearly all of the PSCs reported is of 2 or above.
Chen and co-workers synthesised such supramolecular polymers using the hydrogen bonding interaction between polythiophene, modified with imidazole side chains (P3HTM, n = 6) and carboxylic acid-appended fullerene (PCBA) (Fig. 11). The supramolecular organisation of the complex P3HTM:PCBA was performed using a 1:0.8 (w/w%) mixture in chlorobenzene that leads to a single species as observed in the UV-vis absorption spectrum with MeOH (2% v/v) as a processing additive. A PSC was fabricated from this material using spin casting followed by annealing at 130 °C, into a photovoltaic array. The optimised device was shown to have PCE values of 3.2% with a VOC of 0.67 V.30

Carbazoles having a 2,7- and a 3,6-substitution pattern have previously been used as donors in photovoltaic devices; in 2012 Fujita and Michinobu reported a PSC using the 1,8-substituted polyalkynyl linked analogue.31 While 2,7-derivatives are well known, the change to the 1,8-series was facilitated by a straightforward synthesis using an efficient Sonogashira coupling reaction.
The most promising polymer combined the 1,8-carbazole with an acceptor unit comprising benzotriothiophene and thiophene shown in Fig. 12. The band gaps for the donor–acceptor polymers P3 and P4 were significantly decreased when compared to the donor-only polymers (2.07 and 1.83 for P3 and P4, respectively, vs. for 2.81 and 2.73 eV for P1 and P2, respectively). When P4 was used in a PSC device with [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methylester (PC61BM) it exhibited a PCE of 0.24% with a VOC of 0.44 V. The device was then doped with 5 and 10% NOBF4 to increase the VOC value to 0.52 and 0.73 V respectively, however these displayed lower PCEs. The polymer P3 displayed a PCE of only 0.05% and therefore was not doped.31

Lin and co-workers have reported a PSC using uracil terminated 2,7-carbazoles or fluorene as a cross linker for a main chain polymer with bithiazole and dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrroles (PBTH) units, and with melanine side arms. Self-assembly via hydrogen bonding afforded the donor polymer (Fig. 13), which was then combined with PC70BM to form the PSC.32 The hydrogen bonding cross linkers can be used to increase the crystallinity of the polymer and the VOC, JSC values, as well as to tune the HOMO–LUMO gap which decreases from 1.81 eV for PBTH to 1.75 and 1.72 eV for PBTH-C and PBTH-F, respectively.32 These differences then translate to the PCEs with PBTH at 0.52% compared to 0.97% and 0.68% for PBTH-C and PBTH-F, respectively; all measurements were taken at 1:1 weight ratio polymer to PC70BM. However when the ratio was increased to 1:2 the PCEs increased significantly to 1.56% for PBTH-C, while a smaller increase was observed for PBTH-F (0.80%); the increase was attributed to the increase in JSC as VOC was unchanged.32 The difference between PBTH-C and PBTH-F can be explained from AFM experiments, which showed the 1:2 ratio blend with PBTH-C being smoother than the PBTH-F one; this is due to the cross linker increasing the crystallinity of the polymer as confirmed by XRD. Above the 1:2 ratio the PCEs decreased as a consequence of the reduced interfacial area of exciton dissociation and insufficient percolation for charge transport.32

Müllen and co-workers have reported a donor–acceptor copolymer using a novel donor, benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b:5,6-c]trithiophene with thiophene and benzothiadiazole moieties, shown in Fig. 14.33
 Fig. 14  BTT polymers synthesised by Müllen.33 
Both polymers showed small π-stacking distances in the solid state, 0.35 and 0.37 nm for BTTP1 and BTTP2 respectively, an indication of donor–acceptor formation. However when analysed in the thin films BTTP1 was highly disordered and thus did not show any field effect response.33 In comparison BTTP2 showed a distinct supramolecular organisation with its edge toward the support surface, the π-stacking distance also decreasing slightly compared to the one observed in solution. The result for BTTP1 is an example the adverse effect of polymer backbone curvature on the performance of FETs.34
All of the PSC examples above have utilised heteroatoms in the polymer backbone, Plunkett and co-workers have reported an all carbon donor–acceptor copolymer using polycyclic aromatics. Two polyalkynyl co-polymers were synthesised using Sonigashira coupling, with an cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene as the acceptor and fluorene or bis-alkoxybenzene as the donor shown in Fig. 15.35
 Fig. 15  Cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene and fluorine/bisalkoxy polymers synthesised by Plunkett.35 
The cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene is a good acceptor due to its stabilisation of the two-electron reduction product of two benzocyclopentadienyl anions as shown in Fig. 16; this is reflected in a LUMO analogous to that of PC61BM. Both polymers displayed small band gaps that were lower in the solid state than in solution; 1.42 and 1.27 eV for the fluorene and bisalkoxy, respectively, in the solid state.35 However no experiments incorporating these polymers into PSCs were reported.

Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs)
Cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT4+) and its variants shown in Fig. 17 have been shown to be versatile acceptors in the field of mechanically interlocked molecules(MIMs), as well as in that of pseudocatenanes and scavengers. The Stoddart group has been particularly active in this field.
 Fig. 17  CBPQT4+ variants synthesised by the Stoddart group. 
Stoddart and co-workers reported the incorporation of CBPQT4+ into a switchable bistable [3]-catenane based on a polyethyleneglycol containing tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and 1,5-dialkyoxynapthalenes (DN) moieties that can be used as a molecular motor as shown in Fig. 18.36 The switchability was achieved by utilising the redox activity of the TTF which has a high binding affinity for CBQFT4+ when neutral, but which decreases upon oxidation. This lowering of the TTF binding affinity makes the DN becomes the preferred donor, as shown in Fig. 18. This process could be followed by 1H NMR as well as UV-vis, as each conformation has distinct peaks and bands attributed to it.36

The group then used the larger CBPQBT4+ with DN and TTF to form donor–acceptor ring–ring complexes. While the original aim to synthesise a Borromean ring (three rings all interlocked with each other) was unsuccessful, three ring-in-ring complexes were synthesised as shown in Fig. 19.37 The large CBPQBT4+ allowed two hexaethyleneglycol (HEG) linked DN or TTF moieties into the cavity; it was then hoped to bind a dialkyl ammonium in the crown ether hoops above and below the DN/TTF CBPQBT4+ complex. The di-TTF catenane showed the highest binding constant of 4300 M−1, an order of magnitude larger than the di-DN value of 280 M−1 while the mix was in between at 580 M−1. The difference in binding constant of TTF vs. DN is surprising as they exhibit similar binding constants within the smaller CBPQT4+ ring; the difference is therefore due to repulsive forces present in bringing together two DN moieties within the CBPQBT4+ ring, repulsive forces that are smaller in the case of TTF. Binding of the dialkyl ammonium was not possible in any ring-in-ring complex as the glycol chains formed hydrogen bonds with the CBPQBT4+ ring thus masking the site for binding.37 However it was possible to bind dibenzyalammonium within the HEG DN ring alone, which confirms that it is possible to bind dialkyl ammoniums within the glycol. This leads to the conclusion that longer polyether chains with strong electron-donors are required to form the Borromean rings. These could hydrogen bond with the CBPQBT4+, while still having enough space to bind dialkylammoniums, and also being encapsulated strongly within the CBPQBT4+.37

CBPQT4+ and DN were used by Stoddart's group in order to model the crystal structures of polypseudorotaxanes.38 Polypseudorotaxanes like most polymers have high molecular weights, which among other factors makes analysis by single crystal X-ray diffraction not possible in the majority of cases. To model the polymeric lattice, oligomeric forms were synthesised using CBPQT4+ with DNs linked by polyethers or conversely an open CBPQT4+ chain with a closed DN polyether ring; the former is shown in Fig. 20. The structures were found to crystallise into an apparently infinite crystal lattice superstructure homologous to that of the polypseudorotaxane. However this was dependent on the chain being over a critical length otherwise [2]pseudorotaxanes were formed. This was because below the critical length, encircling occurs to maximise the donor–acceptor interactions. This method can then be used to predict crystal structures of related polyrotaxanes even if a structure is not attainable by conventional approaches.38

Finally Stoddart's group used ‘ExBox4+’ as a scavenger for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). ExBox4+ has dimensions of 3.5 × 11.2 Å and is able to form a variety of donor–acceptor complexes with a wide range of PAHs from azulene to coronene as shown in Fig. 21.39 Binding affinities were dependent on the number of π-electrons and the shape of the PAH. Higher binding affinities were associated with an increasing number of π-electrons, which is unsurprising as this generally results in a larger π overlap. However the shape of the PAH also plays a significant role as exemplified by tetraphene and chrysene displaying lower binding affinities (0.914 and 2.32 M−1, respectively) then pyrene, which despite possessing the same number of π-electrons, had a binding affinity of 7.16 M−1. When the PAH is too large to fit entirely in the ExBox4+ it arranges itself within the cavity so that there is the largest possible overlap of π-surface, thus maximising the binding affinity. While the larger PAHs formed 1:1 crystal complexes with ExBox4+, the smaller PAHs like pyrene and below were found to form 2:1 complexes with ExBox4+, with the second PAH binding outside the ExBox4+ through C–H⋯π interactions. The PAH scavenging ability of the ExBox4+ was then demonstrated in an experiment where 4 ml of a 8 mM solution of ExBox4+ in D2O, with 150 μL of crude oil in 4 ml of dichloromethane was shaken in a vial for 2 minutes.39 Using this method 1.2 mg of PAHs were isolated from the crude oil.

Another acceptor moiety used within the field of MIMs is NDI, which has been used in the synthesis of a variety of water soluble and [2]- and [3]-catenanes by the Sanders group.40,41
In comparison with the stepwise approach taken by the Stoddart group, the Sanders group utilised dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) in the synthesis of their catenanes. In all cases reported, NDI cores were linked by a alkyl chain of various lengths (2–9 carbons) and terminated with cysteine residues. Dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCLs) of these compounds in the presence and absence 2,6-DNs led to the discovery of [2]- and [3]-donor–acceptor catenanes and [2]-all acceptor catenanes Fig. 22.40,41

The driving force behind the selection of catenane formation is the donor–acceptor interactions and the hydrophobic effect, by which catenane ‘buries’ the aromatic cores or alkyl chains most effectively. Manipulation of the linker length, chirality, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters was found to allow selective synthesis of a range of [2]- and [3]-catenanes.41 For example when the linker length of the NDI was even and under six carbons, [3]catenanes were shown to form, while odd linkers under six carbons were found to form macrocycles and unconventional catenanes, which highlighted an unexpected ‘odd–even’ effect in DCLs. While the [3]-catenane is the thermodynamic product of odd numbered linkers under six carbons, some libraries were fully oxidised before they reached thermodynamic equilibrium and only kinetic products were observed. Addition of fresh thiol was found to help this, as in the case of the five carbon linker, where it was possible to form the [3]catenane as one of the major species in the DCL. While the [3]catenane initial yield was in trace amount, it could be increased (in some cases up to 33%) by addition of 1 M NaNO3, which is unsurprising as increases the polarity of the DCL and thus the contribution of hydrophobic effect to the self-assembly. A template used in the four carbon linker DCL was spermine which interacts with the negative charges of the carboxylates to increase the yield of the corresponding [3]-catenane to 60%.40 Above six carbons, the ‘odd–even’ effect does not manifest itself and these longer alkyl chains were found to lead to the formation of [2]-catenanes. When a mixture of L- and D-isomers of the NDI building blocks was used, the heterochiral catenanes were found to be formed in larger proportion than their homochiral analogues. A particular case is the formation of a all-acceptor [2]catenane from an NDI building block containing a nine carbon linker. This was formed in the absence of DN in the DCL and its formation is driven by the hydrophobic effect.41
Conclusions
The articles highlighted here represent only a small selection of the 2012 literature concerning donor–acceptor interactions. The topics covered reveal the interdisciplinarity of this research and the wide applications that donor–acceptor interactions have in supramolecular chemistry and smart materials. This area of research will provide, without a doubt through its elegance and versatility, more exciting discoveries in the years to come.
