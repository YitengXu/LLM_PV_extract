Extended bending of the devices does not deteriorate their performance demonstrating their suitability for roll to roll processing.

Broader context
Thin film photovoltaics represent the ultimate goal in the quest for clean renewable energy. Recently, methylammonium lead halide perovskites have been identified as promising absorbers for solar cells. Over the past three years, the performance of perovskite-based solar cells has rapidly improved reaching efficiencies as high as 15%. The perovskite absorbers are prepared from low-cost and abundantly available components allowing for the preparation of low cost photovoltaic devices and modules. However, to achieve very low cost devices they should be prepared using roll to roll (R2R) processes on large area flexible substrates. This requires a device architecture that does not need high temperature steps and that can be prepared using large area coating or printing methods. Here we show that methylammonium lead iodide perovskite layers when sandwiched in between two thin organic charge transporting layers and processed on a polymer based conductive substrate using large area compatible coating techniques lead to flexible solar cells with high power conversion efficiencies. Moreover, extended bending of these devices does not deteriorate their performance demonstrating the suitability of perovskite based solar cells for roll to roll processing.

Thin film photovoltaic devices hold great promise to reduce the dependencies on fossil energy.1 After the seminal work of Miyasaka et al.,2 tremendous progress in the performance of methylammonium lead iodide perovskite based solar cells has been made.3–12 The hybrid organic–inorganic methylammonium lead iodide perovskites, pioneered by Mitzi, have been recognized for their excellent semiconducting properties.13,14 The ease with which these organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials can be prepared and processed from solution has made them attractive for photovoltaic applications.15 All high efficiency perovskite solar cells reported until now use (mesoscopic) metal oxides such as Al2O3, TiO2 or ZrO2 requiring a high temperature sintering process. Ball et al. showed that a thick layer (350 nm) of the mixed halide methylammonium lead perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) leads to efficient solar cells (12%).9 They argued that the perosvkite functions as the absorber and as the electron and hole transporter. Additionally, it was suggested that the excitons predominantly dissociate in the bulk and not at a donor–acceptor interface. Hence, no bulk heterojunction between donor and acceptor is required to achieve efficient cells. This was confirmed by Liu et al., who showed that the mesostructure of the metal oxide is not required to prepare efficient (15.4%) perovskite based solar cells.12 Recent results indicate that at least part of the excitons dissociate at the interface of the perovskite layer and the hole and electron transporting layer.16,17 An inverted layout, similar to that employed in small molecular weight and polymeric solar cells, has also been described.18,19 In these devices, the holes are extracted via the transparent conductor poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS). Recently, we have improved the performance of such inverted devices by sandwiching an evaporated CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite in between organic electron and hole blocking layers, reaching a PCE of 12%.20 In view of the above mentioned results the perovskite based solar cells are very well suited for roll to roll (R2R) processing on flexible substrates. It is not clear, however, how the perovskite active layer will behave on a flexible substrate especially when it is bent. The perovskite is a crystalline material; hence, cracks or other imperfection may occur upon bending it.
Here, we present a flexible thin film solar cell based on a sublimated methylammonium lead iodide perovskite layer that is sandwiched in between two very thin electron and hole blocking layers consisting of organic molecules. A flexible transparent conductor based on a stack of thin layers of aluminium doped ZnO (AZO), silver and AZO was used (Fig. 1). Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) as high as 7% were obtained and maintained when the solar cell was bent over a roll with a diameter of 5.5 cm for 50 times. No significant deterioration of the key performance parameters of the solar cell was observed indicating that the perovskite is compatible with roll to roll processing.

The flexible solar cell was prepared on 50 micron thick PET foil coated with a transparent silver electrode. The electrodes were produced by depositing a multilayer stack composed of AZO 30 nm/Ag 9 nm/AZO 30 nm, where AZO designates Al doped ZnO with 2 wt% Al. The coating was applied by DC magnetron sputtering in a batch coater. For the AZO planar ceramic targets were used. The process pressure was about 5 × 10−3 mbar. In the visual range, the electrode transparency was 81%, with a sheet resistance of 7.5 Ohm. The coating process can be easily transferred to large scale roll to roll coating.21,22 After cleaning the foils by rinsing them with ultrapure water and isopropanol a 70 nm poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) layer was deposited using spin coating and it was annealed for 15 minutes at 90 °C. Following the PEDOT:PSS layer a thin layer (20 nm) of poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine] (polyTPD) was deposited by spin coating (Fig. 1), as the electron blocking layer. On top of this the CH3NH3PbI3 was thermally evaporated to a thickness of 260 nm followed by a thin layer (30 nm) of [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM) as the hole blocking layer.23 The device was completed by the evaporation of an Au top electrode (70 nm). The PCBM layer was deposited using a meniscus coating process to ensure a high quality film.24 The thickness of the layers was established using absorbance measurements. Full details of the device fabrication and characterization are provided in the ESI.†
The CH3NH3PbI3 films grown on the AZO/Ag/AZO substrates were characterized using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). Fig. 2 shows the X-ray powder pattern of a CH3NH3PbI3 film evaporated on an AZO/Ag/AZO substrate, revealing the formation of a crystalline layer. The sharp diffraction peaks of the perovskite can readily be identified. Interestingly, upon comparison with a perovskite film evaporated on glass it can be noted that no preferential orientation is observed on the flexible AZO/Ag/AZO substrates, in contrast to what happens in the case of glass.

The star on the green diffractogram indicates a reflection of the gold used in the device. 
Due to the small sample size the application of the hole blocking layer using meniscus coating is difficult. In particular, the thickness of this layer was not easy to control. Due to this we used a PCBM layer of approximately 30 nm which is thicker than needed. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) cross-section of the thin film device is shown in Fig. 3. The resolution of the image is limited by the charging of the sample at higher magnification.

Fig. 4a shows the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of a typical small area (0.12 cm2) flexible perovskite solar cell measured under light intensities of 100 mW cm−2. The reproducibility from device to device was within 10%. The short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) for a typical device, respectively, are 14.3 mA cm−2, 1.04 V and 0.47, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 7%. Previously, on glass substrates JSC, VOC and FF of 16.1 mA cm−2, 1.05 V and 0.67, respectively, have been obtained leading to a PCE of 12%.20

Hence, the main difference between the devices on the glass substrates and on the foils is the lower FF which causes the strong reduction in the PCE. The main reason for this decrease in FF and PCE is due to the thicker hole and electron blocking layers in the flexible cells. The increased thickness of these layers is caused by more difficult handling of the small area flexible substrates. This can be solved when a larger substrate is used in either a batch or roll-to-roll (R2R) process employing slot-die coaters. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra exhibit 74% (Fig. 4b) where the generation of photocurrent started at 790 nm in agreement with the band gap of the CH3NH3PbI3.
In spite of the before mentioned shortcomings the PCE obtained is among the highest reported for flexible solar cells using organic molecules.25–27 Yet, more important than the actual value of the PCE is the effect that repeated bending of the substrate has on it. To investigate this, the flexible solar cells were bent over a roll with a diameter of 5.5 cm. The performance was evaluated up to 50 bending cycles and no reduction of the key performance indicators was observed. JSC and VOC remained identical throughout the test and the fill factor decreased slightly from 0.474 to 0.464 after 50 bending cycles, which lead to a decrease in the PCE of 0.1% (Fig. 5b).

Conclusions
In summary, flexible solar cells based on the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite absorber have been prepared. The device layout is very compatible with flexible substrates because all the processes are performed at room temperature. The exception is the annealing at 90 °C of the polymeric conductor (PEDOT:PSS) which is well below the critical temperature of most polymers. An AZO/Ag/AZO coated PET foil was used as the flexible substrate. In spite of some difficulties in controlling the thickness of the essential electron and hole blocking layers power conversion efficiencies as high as 7% were obtained. More importantly, this solar cell layout is very robust leading to a decline of the power conversion efficiency of only 0.1% after 50 bending cycles. This demonstrates that the perovskite solar cells are very suitable for roll to roll production.
