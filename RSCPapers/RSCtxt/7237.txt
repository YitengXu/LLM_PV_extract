    , Accepted 4th January 2018First published on 5th January 2018AbstractSuperstructured mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were successfully prepared from mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods by the annealing method for the first time. The as-prepared mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets in this work showed remarkable visible light absorption, mainly due to the formation of oxygen vacancy defects in the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets, which was also confirmed by XPS spectra, Raman spectra and EPR spectra. Besides, the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets showed a highly enhanced photocatalytic activity of 11268.24 μmol g−1 h−1, about 3.95 times that of commercial Ta2O5. Moreover, the specific surface area of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5-800 nanosheets was 16.34 m2 g−1, about 5.32 times that of the commercial Ta2O5 (3.072 m2 g−1). The valence band XPS spectra indicated a strong oxidizing ability of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets in comparison to that of commercial Ta2O5. The formation of superstructured Ta2O5 mesocrystals generated long lifetime carriers and effective conduction pathways, which greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production.
1. Introduction
Solar energy conversion to create renewable fuels and useful chemicals is a highly promising approach to relieve and solve the world energy shortage and serious environmental pollution.1–3 How to make full use of solar energy for production of renewable fuels and useful chemicals is the focus of much research and a major challenge.4–6 As a widely studied and promising technology, photocatalysis offers us an improved opportunity in comparison to the traditional methods for the exploitation of green and valuable chemicals,7–9 such as photocatalytic hydrogen production10–12 and CO2 reduction,13–15 in which semiconductor photocatalysts play crucial roles.16–19 Since Fujishima and Honda discovered the water splitting phenomenon in 1972,20 the research on semiconductor photocatalysis has developed rapidly.21–23 However, unlike natural enzyme photocatalysts, artificial photocatalysts always suffer from certain disadvantages, such as limited photocatalytic activity and solar energy utilization efficiency.24–26 Therefore, the synthesis of efficient and wide spectral response photocatalysts is still highly anticipated.3,27,28
Mesocrystals are a novel class of highly ordered monocrystal-like materials, which consist of numerous aligned mesoscopic size crystals with internal porosity.29–32 In general, mesocrystal photocatalysts offer long lifetime photo-induced carriers and effective conduction pathways for efficient photocatalysis.33 Mesocrystal photocatalysts have showed great potential in photocatalytic fuel production since mesocrystals first systematically received extensive attention.30,34 Thus, a number of studies have been carried out for preparing novel semiconductor mesocrystal-based photocatalysts.34–38 To date, many different types of mesocrystal photocatalysts have been developed, such as TiO2 mesocrystals,39 Au-TiO2 mesocrystals,40 nitrogen and fluorine codoped TiO2 mesocrystals,41 g-C3N4 modified TiO2 mesocrystals,42 CdS quantum dots modified TiO2 mesocrystals,43 Ti3+ doped Au/Cl-TiO2 mesocrystals,44 Zn-doped Fe3O445 and SrTiO3 mesocrystals.46 So far, no studies on the synthesis of mesocrystals of the typical wide band gap material Ta2O5 have been reported.
As a typical wide band gap semiconductor, Ta2O5 exhibits no visible light response and limited photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production and pollutant removal.47–49 The development of efficient and stable photocatalysts based on Ta2O5 is still an active research goal, especially for wide band gap Ta2O5 mesocrystals.50 Recently, several Ta2O5 photocatalysts have been reported, including F-Ta2O spheres,51 sulfur-doped Ta2O5,52 Ta2O5 quantum dots,53 Ta2O5 nanowires,54 N-Ta2O5,55,56 Ta2O5 nanorods,57 ordered Ta2O5,58 crystalline Ta2O5 nanorods,59 mesoporous Ta2O5,60 single crystalline Ta2O5 nanorods,61 Au-Ta2O5,62,63 NaTaO3/Ta2O5,64 Ta2O5 nanotubes,65 N-doped Ta2O5 spheres,66 Ta2O5/g-C3N4,67 Ta2O5 submicrospheres60 and Pt-Pd/Ta2O5.68 However, novel and efficient superstructured Ta2O5 mesocrystals with visible light response have not been reported. Besides, Ta2O5 as a semiconductor has a higher conduction band minimum than TiO2, an obvious advantage for photocatalysis, as it potentially offers a strong driving force for water splitting.2 Therefore, the synthesis of Ta2O5 photocatalysts seems highly desirable, especially for superstructured Ta2O5 mesocrystals. In summary, superstructured Ta2O5 mesocrystal nanosheets are highly desirable candidates for efficient and stabilized photocatalysis.
In this work, superstructured (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 mesocrystals were successfully prepared for the first time by the self-assembly of (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanoparticles for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Superstructured Ta2O5 mesocrystals were also successfully fabricated through the conversion of (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 mesocrystals by the annealing method for the first time. We investigated the optical properties, physical properties, valence band structure, photoelectrochemical properties and photocatalytic performances for hydrogen production of the as-prepared mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets. Finally, the possible transport pathways of the photo-generated carriers and the photocatalytic mechanisms of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets for hydrogen production were also proposed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and Ta2O5 nanosheets
The chemicals in this experiment were commercially available and used without purifications. The mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods were fabricated by facile vapor hydrolysis reactions following our previous method.57 In a typical procedure, 0.30 g Ta(C2H5O)5 was dispersed into 6 mL NH4F-ethylene glycol in an inner container (1.6 M) and stirred for about 60 s, and the inner container was transferred into a Teflon lined vessel which contained 8 mL distilled water. After sealing the autoclave, the reactions were carried out at 160 °C for 24 h. Mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods were obtained after washing with ethanol several times and drying in an oven at 60 °C for 24 h. The mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were prepared by the annealing method. First, the as-prepared mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods were transferred into a ceramic crucible with a cover and heated to different temperatures at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 for 3 h in a muffle furnace, as shown in Scheme 1. After cooling down to room temperature, mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were obtained. The samples prepared at 750, 800, 850 and 900 °C were denoted as the mesocrystalline Ta2O5-750, mesocrystalline Ta2O5-800, mesocrystalline Ta2O5-850 and mesocrystalline Ta2O5-900, respectively.

2.2. Characterization
The morphologies and microstructures of the as-prepared mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were investigated by cold field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi, SU8010), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Tecnai, G2F30) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) at 200 kV. The XRD patterns of the (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 mesocrystal nanorods and Ta2O5 mesocrystal nanosheets were recorded by an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, X'Pert PRO) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The element chemical states and valence band structure were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB 250Xi). The UV-vis diffuse reflection absorption spectra of commercial Ta2O5, mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were obtained using a double-beam ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Beijing General Instrument co., Ltd., TU-1900) with BaSO4 as reference standard. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distributions of commercial Ta2O5, mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were measured on a nitrogen adsorption analyzer (Quantachrome Corporation, QuadraSorb Station 3). The uncoupled electron properties of (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 mesocrystals and Ta2O5 mesocrystals were studied by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) (Bruker Corporation, A300-10/12) at 90 K. The Raman spectra were obtained on a laser Raman spectrometer (LabRAM XploRA, HORIBA Jobin Yvon Co. Ltd) using a 532 nm laser with incident power of 150 μW.
2.3. Photocatalytic hydrogen production tests
The photocatalytic performances of commercial Ta2O5, mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were evaluated by a sealed gas circulation and evacuation system (LabSolar-IIIAG, Beijing PerfectLight Co., Ltd, China) for hydrogen production. In a typical procedure, 0.05 g catalysts containing 2% Pt co-catalyst was dispersed into 100 mL methyl alcohol-distilled water solution (V/V = 1:4) by ultrasonication treatment for 30 min. Then the mixture was transferred into a quartz reactor. After pumping the air in the system to about −0.1 MPa, the reactor was irradiated by a Xe lamp (PLS SXE300C, Beijing PerfectLight Co., Ltd, China) for 60 min. After pumping the generated H2 in the photodeposition process so that the pressure of the photocatalytic systems returned to about −0.1 MPa again, the photocatalytic activity tests were carried out under a Xe lamp (PLS SXE300C). The generated H2 in this process was measured by a gas chromatograph (Techcomp, 7890II, TCD detector, molecular sieve 5 Å column and Ar carrier gas). The photocatalytic activity of commercial Ta2O5 and mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods were also tested for comparison.
2.5 Photoelectrochemical tests
The transient photocurrent responses of commercial Ta2O5, mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were tested on a CHI660D electrochemical working station (Shanghai, Chen Hua) with a three-compartment cell. In this work, the Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt sheet electrode were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, and 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution served as electrolyte. The working electrodes of commercial Ta2O5, mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were prepared by the electrophoretic deposition method according to the literature.69 In a typical procedure, 0.025 g catalyst was dispersed in 50 mL isopropyl alcohol with a small amount of Mg(NO3)2 and treated with ultrasonication for 30 min. The electrophoretic deposition reactions were carried out at 50 V direct-current voltage for 3 min with ITO glass as working electrode and Pt sheet as counter electrode, and the as-prepared electrodes were dried in an oven at 80 °C for 30 min
3. Results and discussion
The morphologies of the mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were observed by SEM. As shown in Fig. 1(a–c), it was obvious that the as-prepared (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 mesocrystals were rod-like shapes with a length of about 8 μm. The diameter of the as-prepared (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods was about 800 nm. Fig. 1(d–f) show the morphologies and microstructures of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets, indicating that the rod-like (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 mesocrystals were converted into Ta2O5 mesocrystals after annealing at 800 °C for 3 h, and the Ta2O5 mesocrystals in Fig. 1(e) were composed of numerous nanocubes, much like TiO2 mesocrystals41 and SrTiO3 mesocrystals.46 As shown in Fig. 1(f), the size of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets was about 300–600 nm, and the thickness was about 50–80 nm, which also confirmed the formation of superstructured Ta2O5 mesocrystals.

Fig. 2 shows the TEM and HRTEM images of the mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 mesocrystals showed a rod-like morphology, which was consistent with the SEM results. Fig. 2(b) shows the magnified TEM image of the (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 mesocrystals, and the surface porosity confirmed the predicted self-assembly of the nanoparticles, their growth and organized aggregation.34,38,44 The insert in Fig. 2(b) shows typical monocrystal features, further confirming the formation of mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods. Fig. 1(c) shows the HRTEM image of the mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods with a plane spacing of 0.387 nm, which corresponds to the d spacing of the (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 (004) plane. After annealing at 800 °C for 3 h, the rod-like (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 mesocrystals were converted into mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 2(d), and the as-prepared Ta2O5 nanosheets were porous. The SAED patterns in Fig. 2(a) display typical monocrystal features. The magnified TEM images in Fig. 2(e, f) of mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets show the surface morphology, which clearly confirms the formation of superstructured Ta2O5 mesocrystals. The HRTEM image of mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets in Fig. 2(g) clearly shows the lattice fringes of the (001) plane with the lattice spacing of around 0.391 nm, further demonstrating the formation of superstructured Ta2O5 mesocrystals. Fig. 2(h) shows a model of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets, which further indicates that superstructured Ta2O5 mesocrystals contributed to the generation of photo-induced carriers enabling long transport pathways for enhanced photocatalytic activity.

Fig. 3 shows the TEM image and corresponding EDS mapping of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets. It was clear that the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were composed of Ta, O and F elements. As reported in previous studies,51,57 the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets contained a certain amount of F, and this element was uniformly distributed on the surface of the as-prepared mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets.

X-ray diffraction was used to investigate the phase structure of the mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets, as shown in Fig. 4. It was found that all the diffraction peaks could be ascribed to those of (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 (JCPDS No. 31-0070), and no other impurity characteristic diffraction peaks could be observed for the as-prepared (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods, indicating that mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods were successfully prepared.54,57,70 For the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets, the XRD patterns well agreed with the standard card of JCPDS No.25-0922 (a = 0.6198 nm, b = 4.029 nm, c = 0.3888 nm, α = β = γ = 90.00°). The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 22.902°, 288.290°, 36.665°, 46.686° and 55.768° could be indexed to the (001), (1110), (1111), (002) and (0312) planes of Ta2O5, respectively. There were no other diffraction peaks of impurities, such as TaO2F, Ta3O7F or TaF5, which also confirmed the formation of Ta2O5 nanosheets but no other Ta-based oxide.35,54

We also investigated the compositions and element chemical states of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the full-scale XPS spectrum confirmed that the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were composed of Ta, O and F elements, which was also consistent with the EDS analysis of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets. In Fig. 5(b), the typical XPS peaks of Ta 4f for the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets at 26.13 and 28.02 eV were respectively attributed to Ta 4f7/2 and Ta 4f5/2, and were lower in energy than that of commercial Ta2O5 (26.37 eV, 28.26 eV), which also indicated the formation of oxygen vacancy defects in the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets.57 The O 1s XPS spectrum of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets in Fig. 5(c) contains peaks at 530.23 and 531.68 eV, which were assigned to oxygen atoms of Ta–O and O–H chemical bonds, respectively. Fig. 5(d) shows the F 1s XPS spectrum of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets. The F 1s XPS peak at 685.29 eV could be attributed to the typical surface fluoride in the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets, and similar results have also been reported in the literature.51,57,61 Thus, it could be concluded that mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were successfully fabricated in this work.

Fig. 6 shows the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra of commercial Ta2O5, mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets. The UV-Vis absorption of the mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods was much weaker than that of commercial Ta2O5 and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets, and its absorption edge was around 280 nm, which indicated a wider band gap than that of commercial Ta2O5 and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets. However, the UV-Vis absorption of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets was stronger than that of commercial Ta2O5 and mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods, especially for the region of 320–420 nm, mainly because of the formation of oxygen vacancy defects in the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets rather than the doping of the surface fluoride. The mesocrystalline Ta2O5-800 nanosheets showed the strongest absorption between 320 and 420 nm, as shown in Fig. 6(b). These absorption spectral characteristics were much like that of Ta2O5 QDs53 and Ta2O5 nanorods,57 which endowed the wide band gap Ta2O5 with desirable visible light response.

The physical properties of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were a key factor for efficient photocatalytic performances. Fig. 7 shows the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the pore size distributions of commercial Ta2O5, mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets presented type IV isotherms with H2 hysteresis loops, the characteristic features of mesoporous materials, which also indicated the formation of a mesocrystalline Ta2O5 catalyst.11,43,71 The pore size distributions of the mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets are shown in Fig. 7(b). The pore sizes of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were less than 50 nm, and the average pore size was 17.78 nm, as shown in Table 1. However, the commercial Ta2O5 exhibited no distinctive pore size distribution features. Besides, the surface area of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets was 16.34 m2 g−1, 5.32 times that of commercial Ta2O5 catalyst (3.072 m2 g−1), which was consistent with some reported mesocrystal photocatalysts.72,73 The increase of the surface area for the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets was derived from the decomposition of the mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods.

To further confirm the formation of oxygen vacancy defects, the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets were measured at 90 K. It was obvious that the as-prepared mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets showed EPR signals at about g = 2.086, as shown in Fig. 8, further confirming the formation of oxygen vacancies11,74–76 which resulted in the absorption by the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets in the region of 320–420 nm.75,77,78

Fig. 9 shows the valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (VB-XPS) and Raman spectra of commercial Ta2O5 and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets. As shown in Fig. 9(a), the valence band of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets shifted to a higher binding energy (0.28 eV), which indicated that mesocrystalline Ta2O5 had stronger ability for methanol oxidation and better photocatalytic performance.79 Besides, the Raman spectrum of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets in Fig. 9(b) showed a blue shift in comparison to that of commercial Ta2O5, which also indicated the formation of oxygen vacancies, and this was consistent with the results of the XPS and DRS absorption spectra.

We also measured the transient photocurrent response and XRD patterns to investigate the charge separation behaviors and structural stability of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets. Fig. 10(a) shows the transient photocurrent response of the commercial Ta2O5, mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and Ta2O5 nanosheets over 15 cycles. It was obvious that the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets presented the strongest transient photocurrent response in comparison to that of commercial Ta2O5 and mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods, which indicated the highest charge separation efficiency.80–82 This resulted in the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. Besides, the XRD patterns of the fresh and used mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets in Fig. 10(b) also confirmed the structural stability after the photocatalytic reactions.57

We also evaluated the photocatalytic performance of commercial Ta2O5, mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods and mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets by photocatalytic hydrogen production, as shown in Fig. 11. The photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of commercial Ta2O5 and mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods were 2851.95 and 3341.39 μmol g−1 h−1. All the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets showed higher photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production than that of commercial Ta2O5 and mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods, mainly because of a higher charge separation efficiency.39,40,44,46 The mesocrystalline Ta2O5-800 photocatalyst showed the highest photocatalytic activity of 11268.24 μmol g−1 h−1, which was about 3.95 times that of commercial Ta2O5. It was the formation of the ordered superstructured Ta2O5 mesocrystals that highly enhanced the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production.

Based on the above analysis, possible transport pathways of the photo-generated carriers and the photocatalytic mechanisms of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets for hydrogen production were proposed. As shown in Fig. 12(a), the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 superstructures contributed to the generation of long lifetime photo-induced carriers and effective conductive pathways for photocatalytic hydrogen production.44,83,84Fig. 12(b) shows the photocatalytic mechanisms of mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets for hydrogen production. Under irradiation, the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets could be easily excited,47,54 and the photo-induced electrons could be transferred to the conduction band of Ta2O5 for photocatalytic hydrogen production.54 The generated holes were removed by methanol oxidation in this process.53,85 It was the formation of superstructured Ta2O5 mesocrystals that highly enhanced the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production.

4. Conclusions
We successfully synthesized mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets for the first time from mesocrystalline (NH4)2Ta2O3F6 nanorods by the annealing method. The as-prepared mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets showed improved UV-vis absorption and highly enhanced photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production was 11268.24 μmol g−1 h−1, about 3.95 times that of commercial Ta2O5. Besides, the oxidizing ability and specific surface area of the mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets also increased in comparison to that of commercial Ta2O5. The as-prepared mesocrystalline Ta2O5 nanosheets in this work could be a promising and efficient photocatalyst for solar energy conversion to chemical fuels.
