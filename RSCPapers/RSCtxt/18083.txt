    , Accepted 29th May 2020First published on 30th May 2020AbstractSolar evaporation is regarded as a promising and sustainable technology to address global clean water crisis. Tremendous efforts have been made for the development of new materials and structures, but heat utilization efficiency and stable salt-rejection remain the major challenges. In this study, a novel sugarcane-derived anisotropic structure with heat–mass flux decoupling effects was invented, and it exhibited outstanding salt-rejection and high efficiency in solar desalination. Numerical simulations revealed that heat–mass flux decoupling was achieved by making the mass flux perpendicular to the heat flux. The horizontally distributed channels provided sufficient water flux towards evaporation surface while transporting the concentrated salt ions from the surface back to the bulk water driven by the concentration gradient. Moreover, temperature gradient-driven heat transfer was effectively suppressed owing to the discontinuous and deficient water flux in the vertical direction. This anisotropic structure showed high efficiency (>80%) and excellent salt-rejecting performance for a wide range of salinities (0–15 wt%) and different solar densities (0.8–3 sun). Furthermore, stable performance was observed during long-term evaporation experiments under harsh operating conditions.
Introduction
Freshwater scarcity is one of the most pressing challenges worldwide.1 One better way to combat this challenge is to convert abundant saline water into freshwater using low-cost energy and processes. An emerging trend comes from solar desalination because new materials and technologies have made the solar energy much cheaper and easily utilizable, and solar desalination has much lower carbon footprint compared to traditional desalination powered by fossil fuels.2,3 Great advancements have been made in solar desalination. For example, by tuning the composition and microstructure of carbon-4–7 or metal-based absorbers, average absorptance has been increased to 90%.8–12 However, the design of water paths is still challenging as they concurrently carry heat and salt. For most of the materials, water transport and heat conduction are coupled with each other mainly in the vertical direction, so higher water flux to evaporation surface is generally accompanied by severe heat loss to the bulk water.8,13–17 As a result, conventional strategies consistently confined the water paths to reduce the heat loss (Fig. 1a).18–25 Unfortunately, confined water paths inevitably obstructed the salt diffusion to the bulk water, so salt originated from the solar evaporation tended to accumulate at the surface and clog the confined water paths, interfering the solar absorption and steam generation.26–28 As such, solutions to overcome this dilemma are strongly desired for the solar desalination.

Anisotropy is the property of being directionally dependent, which endows materials with different properties in different directions.29 With anisotropic materials, it is hopeful to make the salt diffusion happen in the direction unfavorable for the heat transfer. Thus, heat can be localized at the evaporation surface and the salt accumulated at the same location can rapidly diffuse to the bulk water.30–32 Recently, anisotropic materials, such as wood, have emerged as structures showing anisotropy in mechanics, mass transport and energy transfer.13,33–38 Newly developed wood membrane using basswood take the advantage of the anisotropic property, allowing heat to spread along the nanofibril direction to reduce the conductive heat transfer, while high porosity enhances water vapour transfer and convective heat transfer.39
In this regard, sugarcane is best known for its outstanding anisotropy and high porosity derived from the vertically aligned lignocellulosic vessels and horizontally stacked parenchymal cells surrounding them. These parenchymal cells separate the lignocellulosic vessels and mainly encapsulate water, which could be removed to endow sugarcane with a large number of closed pores in the cell walls. Therefore, in this study, we reported an anisotropic structure derived from the vertically cut sugarcane internodes (VSIs) for efficient solar desalination with excellent salt-rejection property through heat–mass flux decoupling (Fig. 1b). Numerical simulations visually revealed that the water flux is perpendicular to the heat flux in VSI during solar desalination. Due to the sufficient water flow in the horizontal direction, concentrated salt ions at the evaporation surface could diffuse rapidly to the bulk water through the horizontal water channels so that fouling becomes minimal. Meanwhile, the heat transfer driven by temperature difference was effectively suppressed due to the limited and discontinuous water flow in the vertical direction. As such, VSI showed impressive salt-rejection performance and accomplished stable solar evaporation with efficiencies over 80% in a wide range of salinities (0–15 wt%) under various solar densities (0.8–3 sun). Even during continuous solar desalination test for half a month, no salt precipitates were observed on the evaporation surface, and no performance deterioration was observed. This heat–mass flux decoupling induced by anisotropy offers a promising approach for sustainable solar desalination.
Experimental
Material preparation
First, sugarcane was skinned and cut into pieces with a thickness of 6 mm by different structures and then sonicated for 30 min, which was repeated for 6 times. Afterwards, they were immersed in ultrapure water within Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclaves and kept under 180 °C for 12 h, followed by water infusion at 70 °C for 12 h. Next, the sugarcane pieces were freeze-dried before pyrolyzing in Ar atmosphere at 400 °C, 700 °C and 900 °C, respectively.
Material characterization
Electron micrographs were obtained via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8020 Hitachi). Absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer (Cary 5000, Varian, USA) with an integrating sphere unit. The solar absorptance (α) was calculated as:17 (1)where I(λ) and R(λ) are the light intensity and the reflectivity as a function of solar spectrum (λ). XPS data were obtained on an ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer microprobe (Thermo Scientific, USA). FTIR data were obtained on a Nicolet 8700 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Wet thermal conductivities of different materials were measured using a thermal conductivity meter (Hotdisk 2500, Sweden Hot Disk Corporation). The solar steam generation materials were tested in the lab using a solar simulator (CEL-S500/350, CEAULIGHT). IR images were obtained using an IR camera (E6, FLIR). Weight changes during the solar evaporation were monitored by an analytical balance (ARR224CN, OHAUS) connected to a computer.
Solar desalination experimental setup
A container wrapped in a thermal insulator was filled with a certain amount of water. The anisotropic carbon was floated on the water and exposed to simulated solar irradiance. An analytical balance connected to a computer recorded the real-time weight change of water during the solar evaporation. During the experiments, IR images were also monitored.
Numerical simulation setup
In the numerical simulation, three physical fields were applied to simulate the heat flux, water transportation and salt transportation in the anisotropic structure, including heat transfer (ht), single-phase laminar flow (spf) and transport of diluted species (tds). In the single-phase laminar flow (spf), Navier–Stokes equations were used to describe the flow field with the inertia term neglected. Incompressible flow and non-slipping wall were also applied. Boundary A and B were set as evaporation surfaces in VSI and his, respectively, and water flux directions were set accordingly (ESI S3, Fig. 3a and S7c†). In the heat transfer (ht), both the solids and fluids were considered as the conductors, and air domains were all considered obeying the heat transfer in solids to simplify the calculation. Boundary A and B were both set at a constant temperature of 316 K to simulate the solar evaporation surface (heat source). In the transport of diluted species (tds), salt transport through diffusion and convection both were considered, which was calculated by the Fick's Law of diffusion. The salt concentration of the boundaries A and B was set at 5.4 mol L−1 (tds inlet) according to the hypothesis that the solar evaporation surface was saturated with the salt produced from evaporation.
Results & discussion
Material characterization
The anisotropic structures were obtained via the pyrolysis of sugarcane (Fig. S1†). VSI exhibited a typical anisotropic structure with numerous closed cavities (Fig. 2a(i, ii)). In the cross section, vascular bundles surrounded by parenchymal cells were uniformly distributed (Fig. 2a(iii)). Vertically, vascular bundles and parenchymal cells were stacked periodically, ensuring the high porosity of VSI. The capillaries between the parenchymal cells were connected to the inner space of the horizontal vascular bundles through the holes that spread over the walls of them, constructing the anisotropic hierarchical structure (Fig. 2a(iv)).

(b) UV-vis spectrum of pyrolyzed sugarcane. (c) Solar evaporation performance of VSI-700 and HSI-700. 
After pyrolysis, the C–C bond dominated and endowed VSI with efficient absorption throughout the whole solar spectrum (Fig. S2 and S3†). When VSI-700 (pyrolysis at 700 °C) was wet (in the working condition), the absorptance (VSI-700 W) was 97%, almost the same as that of HSI-700 (97.5%, horizontally cut sugarcane internodes pyrolyzed at 700 °C) (Fig. 2b and S3b†). However, VSI-700 exhibited better solar evaporation performance than HSI-700 (Fig. 2c). The net evaporation rate of VSI-700 was 1.05 ± 0.05 kg m−2 h−1 with the water content of ∼63 vol%, equivalent to the efficiency of (86.5 ± 4)%, while it was only (79.8 ± 1.2)% for HSI-700 (water content = ∼45 vol%, Fig. S5a†). From the energy balance analysis, the energy loss for VSI-700 mainly comprised of 3% light absorption loss, 1.9% radiative heat loss, 2.1% convective heat loss and 4.5% conductive heat loss, which summed up to be 11.5% and agreed with the calculated evaporation efficiency of (86.5 ± 4)% (see ESI S2 for the calculation details†). In contrast, HSI-700 suffered from severe conductive heat loss (11.64%) to the bulk water, which lowered its efficiency. According to the conventional theory, confining water paths and lowering the water content tend to elevate the solar evaporation performance.14,20,26,27,40 However, unlike most previously reported solar evaporation systems, VSI-700 with a higher water content was more efficient than HSI-700 (Fig. S5b and c†). This result suggested that the heat and mass transfer in the anisotropic structures may differ from that of the conventional isotropic material.
Mechanistic study on the heat–mass decoupling effects
To understand the mechanism of solar evaporation in the anisotropic structure, finite element simulation was employed to study the mass and heat transfer in VSI and HSI (ESI S3 and S4†). One typical anisotropic unit was built based on the structure and characteristics of the sugarcane internodes. Boundary A and boundary B were selected as the solar evaporation surfaces in VSI and HSI, respectively (Fig. 3a and S7†). The evaporation surface was set as both the salt (5.4 mol L−1) and heat (316 K) sources to initiate the salt and heat transfer. Flow field was employed to simulate the water supply towards the evaporation surface. The results showed that the salt and heat flux synchronously coupled to the water flux in HSI (Fig. 3b and c). The high density of the total salt flux arrows indicate that salt diffusion mainly took place in the vertical water paths. Moreover, the heat converted from the solar energy at the evaporation surface was simultaneously transferred (temperature gradient-driven) to the bulk water through the vertical water paths. The energy intensity was an order of magnitude higher than those in the skeleton and capillary, resulting in a severe heat loss (∼105 W m−2) towards the bulk water (Fig. S8†). This heat loss intensity was rather close (90%) to the situation when the solar evaporation surface was in direct contact with the bulk water, which was not beneficial for the heat utilization and water evaporation (Fig. 3h).

(d and e) Cross sections of total heat flux and temperature distribution in VSI after heat transfer for 200 ms. (f and g) Cross sections of total salt flux and salt concentration distribution in VSI after salt diffusion for 10 s. (h and i) Average temperature (h) and salt concentration (i) changes in VSI and HSI (dotted lines represent the heat and salt transfer in situations of solar evaporation surface directly contacting bulk water with the same volume as the anisotropic unit). 
While in VSI, the water path was horizontally distributed across the anisotropic unit, and the capillary in VSI was discontinuous and short compared to that in HSI. Because the temperature gradient only existed in the vertical direction, heat transfer in VSI also occurred in the vertical direction. As a result, the heat flux mainly followed narrow and discontinuous capillary channels down from surface to the bulk water, which resulted in longer heat transfer paths and smaller conduction area (Fig. 3d). This means that the horizontal water flux was perpendicular to the vertical heat flux in VSI (Fig. 3e). After passing through the horizontal water path, the heat flux was confined to the narrow capillary channels again and its intensity decreased by ∼90% (Fig. S9†). The heat loss of VSI reduced by 50% compared to that of HSI, demonstrating effective suppression of the heat loss (Fig. 3h). Moreover, the thermal conductivities of VSI and HSI (saturated with water) were experimentally measured to quantify the heat transfer property. The value of VSI was only (0.2404 ± 0.0003) W m−1 K−1, which was 13% lower than that of HSI (0.2754 ± 0.0013 W m−1 K−1). This also agreed with the numerical simulation results, further demonstrating that the heat loss could be effectively suppressed in VSI.
Moreover, the salt diffusion was still efficient via horizontal water paths in VSI (Fig. 3f). The concentration gradient-driven diffusion dominated the salt-rejection process, as it shared a similar pattern and direction with the total salt flux (Fig. 3g and S10a–c†). Therefore, the heat–mass decoupling effects occurred in VSI. Salt could diffuse along the horizontal water path and further horizontally transfer to the bulk water, which was critical for rapid salt diffusion. Impressively, the intensity of salt flux reduced to 2.5% after passing through the horizontal water path, implying a quick salt diffusion to the bulk water via the horizontal water path (Fig. 3f, and S10d†). As salt only diffused via capillaries in VSI, the mass transfer area only covered 10% of the evaporation surface in VSI model. However, the salt concentration in VSI became uniform only 1.5 times slower than directly diffusing in water (Fig. 3i). This indicated that due to the higher concentration gradient, the salt diffusion rate in VSI was 4 times as directly diffusing in the bulk, which offset the small mass transfer area of VSI. Thus, the salt concentration gradient originated from the water evaporation could be reduced and salt could be quickly taken away from the evaporation surface. Therefore, VSI is promising with enhanced salt rejection and heat insulation property due to the heat–mass decoupling induced by anisotropy.
Solar desalination performances
Solar desalination tests were further employed to verify the property enabled by the anisotropic structure. Salt rejection for high-salinity water has been a major challenge in solar desalination.26,41 However, even with a high salinity of 15 wt%, the efficiency of VSI maintained over 80% without observable salt accumulation after a one-hour solar desalination test (Fig. 4a). As salt precipitation hinders water evaporation and leads to higher surface temperature,26 the average surface temperature of VSI-700 was kept at around 42.4 °C during the test, demonstrating its high salt-rejecting ability and stable evaporation performance (Fig. 4c). Meanwhile, high solar density also challenges the salt rejection.27,35 However, even under 3 sun irradiance, no salt was observed, suggesting that salt could rapidly diffuse back to the bulk water (Fig. 4b and S11†). These phenomena corresponded well with the numerical simulation that anisotropy could endow VSI with great ability to reject the salt precipitation via fast diffusion back to the bulk water. These results further proved that the heat–mass flux decoupling led to rapid mass flux (water supply and salt rejection) as well as excellent heat localization.

(d) Digital photos (i–vii) of VSI-700 during salt-rejecting test. (e) Net average evaporation rate during the half-month solar desalination test (gray and white areas represent dark and solar irradiance, respectively). 
Further, experiments were also performed to evaluate the salt-rejection ability of VSI under harsh evaporation conditions over long period of time. When VSI was floating on 3.5 wt% saline water, 0.25 g cm−2 of additional solid NaCl was placed on the VSI surface. Impressively, the solid on its surface was dissolved and disappeared after just ∼1.5 h under one sun irradiance (Fig. 4d). Moreover, a density flow from VSI was observed (Fig. 4d(viii)), demonstrating that salt dissolved in VSI and fast diffused back to the bulk water. A continuous solar desalination test was further performed to characterize the steady-state salt-rejection ability of VSI. VSI kept floating on 3.5 wt% saline water under one sun irradiance for 8 h per day and in dark for 16 h per day to simulate the practical conditions. Results indicated that no detectable salt was formed on its surface, and no deterioration of the solar evaporation performance happened. Even after half a month, VSI was still in its original state (Fig. 4e). Therefore, VSI exhibited excellent salt-rejecting ability and high desalination efficiency, which are attributed to its anisotropic structure.
Comparison between conventional and decoupling strategy
This finding is different from the conventional method of confining water paths to improve the heat utilization. For solar desalination, the material structure always dominates its efficiency because of the heat–mass coupling as well as the resulting trade-off between the heat management and water transport. For instance, an appropriate porosity could obviously elevate the solar desalination efficiency.14,20,40 Since porosity governs the water transport from the bulk to the solar-thermal conversion layer and the heat transfer in the reverse direction, so it is critical for the heat management. Actually, these phenomena have been widely concluded as the strategies of reducing the contact between water and solar-thermal conversion layer for efficient solar desalination (Fig. 5).5,9,12,14,20,21,26,34,40–65 In general, solar evaporation materials can be classified into four types. Type I represents the situation of a solar-thermal conversion layer directly floating on the water. Due to the severe conductive heat loss resulting from the direct contact, type I usually exhibits low solar evaporation efficiency. Compared to type I, type II only leaves part of the solar-thermal conversion layer in direct contact with water. Thus, it has better efficiency due to the heat insulating layer and shows salt-rejection property due to the rapid salt redispersion via the partial direct contact. Type III totally avoids the direct contact between the solar-thermal conversion layer and water, so better heat localization is achieved but the salt redispersion is limited. Therefore, the solar desalination efficiency of type III was elevated, but only a part of literature declares salt-rejection property. Type IV further minimizes the contact by using an extra confined water path, thus a small and “closed” water domain formed and the heat conduction loss was almost avoided. However, sacrificing water transport rate inevitably hindered the salt redispersion to the bulk water. Recently, the precipitated salt on the material surface has been utilized to extract minerals from the seawater.66 In general, limited by the heat–mass flux coupling, vast majority of the solar evaporation materials have exhibited elevated efficiencies via the minimization of the contact with water. It could be ascribed to limiting the excessive water transport for better heat localization. Moreover, this tendency further illustrated that balancing the trade-off between the heat management and water transport would sacrifice the salt-rejection property.
 Fig. 5  Comparison of VSI vapor generation performance and literatures under 1 sun (references are listed in Table S1†). 
Differently, anisotropic structures can break this conventional trade-off via heat–mass flux decoupling. The rapid water transport in the horizontal direction synchronously avoided serious heat conduction loss in the vertical direction and ensured rapid salt dispersion, thus outstanding salt-rejection property and highly efficient solar desalination were achieved simultaneously. By optimizing the thickness of this anisotropic structure (Fig. S5d†), the solar evaporation efficiency could be further optimized to 88.9%. Moreover, as the hydrophilicity has been widely reported to affect the solar evaporation, increasing the hydrophilicity of the VSI surface is also promising to further elevate its solar evaporation efficiency.5,59,67
Just as the inductive reasoning in our work, rapid water transport has been reported in horizontally aligned wood-based solar evaporator.13 Recently, high proton conduction was directed in anisotropic nanotubes.29 Besides, the low thermal conductivity in the radial direction of wood has also been utilized to construct a hydrophobic nanostructured wood membrane for membrane distillation.39 Thus, it was reasonable for us to generalize that the strategy of heat–mass decoupling could be achieved by more anisotropic structures other than sugarcane-derived one. The conventional strategy of minimizing the contact with water could be changed by taking advantage of the anisotropy for highly efficient and stable solar desalination.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that heat–mass flux decoupling induced by the anisotropic structure in solar evaporation contributes to excellent salt-rejection ability and efficient solar desalination. The heat–mass flux decoupling effect was induced by the difference of driving forces for heat transfer (temperature gradient-driven) and mass transfer (concentration gradient-driven). The decoupling of the horizontal water flux and vertical heat flux endowed the anisotropic materials with superior heat insulation properties and efficient mass transfer performance. The anisotropic structure achieved efficiencies over 80% in a wide range of salinities (0–15 wt%) and rigorous solar densities (0.8–3 sun). Meanwhile, it was ultra-stable even during half-month of continuous solar desalination operation. The strategy developed in this study opens up new possibilities for manipulating the mass and heat transfer via anisotropic structures. Future optimization of the salt-rejecting solar evaporators and distillation membranes can be foreseen using other types of bio-derived anisotropic structures.
