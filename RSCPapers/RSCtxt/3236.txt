    , Accepted 28th July 2014First published on 29th July 2014AbstractUniform zinc oxide (ZnO) nanosheet arrays were grown on woven titanium wires using a low temperature hydrothermal method. Photoanodes were prepared by depositing CdS and CdSe quantum dots onto the ZnO nanosheet arrays by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. Solar cells were assembled using these nanostructured photoanodes and their photovoltaic performance was characterized. The effect of using SILAR cycles for the deposition of quantum dots on the performance of these nanostructured solar cells was investigated systematically. The overall light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 0.98% was achieved under 100 mW cm−2 illumination for flexible CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells using conventional Pt foils as counter electrodes. To further improve the performance of the flexible solar cells, PbS and Cu2S counter electrodes based on Pb and Cu foils were fabricated. The best conversion efficiencies of flexible CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells using Cu2S and PbS counter electrodes were 3.4% and 2.5%, which demonstrated a significant enhancement in values for short circuit current, open circuit voltage, and fill factor compared to those obtained with the commonly used Pt and Au electrodes.
1. Introduction
Since the first work pioneered by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991,1–3 the use of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has attracted significant attention all over the world. Attributed to the successive optimization of materials and fabrication techniques, a conversion efficiency of more than 12% has recently been reported by Yella et al.4
For most of the reported nanostructured solar cells, transparent conductive oxide glass is widely used as the substrate material. However, it is fragile, heavy, and has a slightly high resistive state, which hampers its application in large-area solar cell modules. Recently, flexible solar cells have attracted significant academic interest and industrial attention, because they are not only convenient for transportation but also more beneficial when used in complex environments.5,6 To develop efficient flexible solar cells, it is critical to tailor the electrode materials to be not only low-cost but also long-lasting. Polymer substrates, such as indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), have been studied as substrates for flexible solar cells.7–10 Zhang et al. have successfully prepared porous nanoparticulate TiO2 films onto an ITO/PET conductive film substrate and fabricated a flexible DSSC with a conversion efficiency of 3.27%.7 A porous ZnO photoelectrode was also constructed onto ITO/PET substrates at room temperature by doctor-blading ZnO gel and the efficiency of the resulting DSSC reached 3.8%.9 These results were promising and are of great importance to the development of flexible DSSCs, whereas the temperature tolerance of these flexible plastic substrates made TiO2 and ZnO generally sinterable only under 200 °C, which is not the optimal sintering temperature and often leads to poor crystallinity. Also, the conductivity of ITO/PET is relatively low, which restricts further improvement of flexible DSSCs using polymer materials. Another candidate for fabricating flexible solar cells is a metal substrate which is used to replace the polymer substrates. Compared with polymers, metals show much better temperature endurance, conductivity and physical chemical stability, all of which have been intensively studied by many groups.11–15 Fan et al. reported a flexible DSSC using a dense TiO2-coated flexible stainless steel mesh as the working electrode and its efficiency reached 1.49%.14 Dai et al.15 grew TiO2-decorated ZnO nanosheets on the surface of Ti mesh and assembled a flexible DSSC whose light-to-electricity conversion efficiency was 3.09%. According to these reports, use of metal materials as substrates for photoanodes has shown impressive potential for use in flexible DSSCs. However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the work was conducted using organic dyes which were still too expensive for industrial applications. Little work has been carried out on using inorganic semiconductors as inexpensive alternatives. Compared with conventional organic dyes, inorganic semiconductors have several advantages: (1) the bandgap of the semiconductor nanoparticles can be tuned by size to match the solar spectrum. (2) Their large intrinsic dipole moments can lead to rapid charge separation and a large extinction coefficient, which is known to reduce the dark current and increase the overall efficiency of the solar cells. (3) Semiconductor sensitizers provide new chances to utilize hot electrons to generate multiple charge carriers with a single photon. Inorganic quantum dots (QDs) such as CdS,16–18 CdSe,19–21 PbS,22,23 In2S3,24 CuInS2,25,26 and Sb2S3 (ref. 27 and 28) have been widely investigated in QD-sensitized solar cell applications which were based on transparent conductive oxide glass. Recently, QD-sensitized solar cells co-sensitized by two kinds of semiconductor QDs with different band-gaps have been reported, which demonstrate better performances compared with QD-sensitized solar cells sensitized by only one kind of QD.29–32
Counter electrodes (CEs), which transfer electrons arriving from the external circuit back to the redox electrolyte and catalyze the triiodide reduction or redox activity of the sulfide/polysulfide couple, are of great importance for the performance of sensitized solar cells. Usually, Pt is used as the catalytic material, which exhibits good catalytic activity for triiodide reduction. In conjunction with aqueous polysulfide electrolytes, Pt, as well as other novel metals such as Au, is not an ideal catalyst as it would generate certain overpotentials for the electrolyte regeneration and result in a reduction of the total conversion efficiency.33,34 Meanwhile, its extreme cost compels researchers to look for cheap alternatives. Use of carbon nanotubes and graphene as novel carbon CEs have been reported,35–37 but their relatively low catalytic activities and complex experimental technique make them inappropriate for industrial applications. Recently, metal sulfides such as CoS, Cu2S and PbS with better catalytic activity and long-term stability with polysulfide solutions have been investigated, and they offer the possibility for further lowering the cost and improving the performance of the solar devices.38–42
In this paper, we report on a flexible, QD-sensitized solar cell based on woven titanium wires. As shown in Fig. 1, uniform ZnO nanosheets were constructed on woven titanium wires and were then sensitized in sequence by CdS and CdSe quantum dots. These CdSe/CdS/ZnO nanostructures were used as photoanodes to fabricate flexible CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells. The growth process of the CdS/CdSe/ZnO/Ti nanostructure is illustrated in Fig. 2. To optimize the sensitizing process, the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) cycles of QD were studied systematically. When 100 μm thick Pt and Au foils were applied as CEs, conversion efficiencies of 0.98% and 0.4%, respectively, were observed for the CdS/CdSe co-sensitized solar cells. To further improve the performance of flexible QD SSCs, Cu2S and PbS CEs based on 100 μm thick Pb and Cu foils have been introduced, which show the best conversion efficiencies of 3.4% and 2.5%, respectively. This study demonstrates a novel CdS/CdSe quantum dot co-sensitized solar cell which can be a promising highly efficient and low-cost candidate for flexible solar cell applications.

2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of ZnO nanosheets on titanium substrate
Woven titanium wires were successively sonicated in concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36–38% by weight, Aladdin), and then mixed in a solution of deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol with volume ratios of 1:1:1 for 10 min. After careful rinsing in deionized water, woven titanium wires were dried in a stream of nitrogen gas as the final step.
ZnO nanosheets were prepared by a two-step chemical method. In the first step, a ZnO seed layer was prepared on woven titanium wires by dip-coating in an alcohol solution which contained 0.02 M zinc acetate dihydrate and 0.02 M lithium hydroxide (LiOH), followed by annealing in a furnace at 400 °C for 1 hour. Then the seeded substrate was placed into an aqueous growth solution which contained 0.2 M zinc nitrate (99.9%, Aladdin) and 1 M urea (99.9%, Aladdin) at 90 °C for 18 hours. After the hydrothermal treatment, the resultant electrode was thoroughly rinsed with deionized water and then annealed at 450 °C for 1 hour to remove any residual organics and improve the crystalline structure. All the chemical reagents were analytical grade and used without any further purification.
2.2 Deposition of CdS and CdSe quantum dots
In a typical SILAR cycle for the deposition of CdS quantum dots, a substrate of woven titanium wires, pre-grown with ZnO nanosheet arrays, was dipped into the 0.05 M Cd(NO3)2 aqueous solution for 30 seconds and then into the 0.05 M Na2S solution (obtained by dissolving Na2S in methanol–water with a volume ratio of 1:1) for another 30 seconds. Similarly, for CdSe quantum dots, the substrate was first dipped into 0.1 M Cd(NO3)2 aqueous solution for 1 min and then into 0.5 M sodium selenosulfate solution (obtained by constantly stirring the mixed solution of selenium powder and sodium sulfite for 6 h at 50 °C) for 5 min. The entire SILAR processes for both CdS and CdSe quantum dots were repeated for different cycles to achieve the desired thickness of QDs.
2.3 Characterization
The morphologies of the ZnO/Ti, CdS/ZnO/Ti and CdSe/CdS/ZnO/Ti nanostructures were examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; FEI Sirion, FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) was performed to determine the composition and stoichiometry of the CdS/ZnO and CdSe/CdS/ZnO nanostructures. The crystal structures of ZnO/Ti, CdS/ZnO/Ti and CdSe/CdS/ZnO/Ti nanostructures were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD; XD-3, PG Instruments Ltd., Beijing, China) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) at a scan rate of 2° per min. X-ray tube voltage and current were set at 36 kV and 20 mA, respectively.
2.4 Solar cell assembly and performance measurement
The solar cell was assembled using sensitized ZnO/Ti (CdS/ZnO/Ti or CdSe/CdS/ZnO/Ti) substrate sealed by 60 μm-thick sealing materials (SX-1170-60, Solaronix SA, Aubonne, Switzerland) on both sides, with an effective area of 0.25 cm2 as photoanode. Cu2S and PbS CEs were prepared by dipping Cu and Pb foils into concentrated sulfuric acid (98%, Aladdin) for 1 hour and 24 hours, respectively. Then the foils were dipped into a mixture of 0.5 M sulfur and 1 M sodium sulfide at 80 °C for 5 minutes. The prepared photoanode was sandwiched between a flexible CE (Au, Cu2S, PbS or Pt foil) and a flexible transparent plastic sealing film to fabricate the solar device. The light was transmitted from the transparent plastic sealing film into the solar cell. A polysulfide electrolyte was introduced via capillary action into the gap formed by the two electrodes. The polysulfide electrolyte was composed of 1 M sulfur, 1 M Na2S, and 0.1 M NaOH, which were dissolved in methanol–water (7:3 v/v) and stirred at 60 °C for 1 h.
A solar simulator (model 94022A, Newport, OH, USA) with an 1.5G air mass filter was used to illuminate the working solar cell at a light intensity of 1 sun (100 mW cm−2). A sourcemeter (Series 2400 SourceMeter, Keithley Instruments Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) was used for electrical characterization during the measurements. The measurements were carried out with a calibrated OSI standard silicon solar photodiode.
3. Results and discussion
The woven titanium wire used in these experiments is flexible with a diameter of about 85 μm with quite a smooth surface. Fig. 3a shows the typical FESEM images of ZnO nanosheets grown on the surface of woven titanium wires. The surface of the titanium cylinder wires is totally and uniformly covered with ZnO nanosheet arrays, which provide a large area for the deposition of QDs. The cross-sectional FESEM images of ZnO nanosheets are shown in Fig. 3b, indicating that there is an average thickness of about 23 μm. The FESEM image clearly indicates that the film is constructed by compactly assembling the nanosheets and the nanosheets are vertically oriented to the surface of the titanium wires at different angles to each other. The dense ZnO nanosheet arrays with ordered orientation may follow a layer-by-layer growth mechanism described by Chen et al. In their study, smaller sheets could be seen on the larger ones, indicating an initial phase of nanosheet growth.43 Recent studies have demonstrated that the thicknesses of ZnO nanosheet arrays were obviously related to the growth time. The ZnO nanosheet arrays became thicker as the growth time increased,15 which suggests an effective method for modifying the thickness of ZnO with an optimal surface area for the QDs.

Fig. 4a shows the top view of the ZnO nanosheets at a high magnification. The space between the nanosheets presents an easily accessed open structure for the deposition of QDs, which is very important for the performance of solar cells. Furthermore, this open structure provided an easy way of filling the electrolyte into the space between the nanosheets and is beneficial to hole diffusion from QDs to the CE. Fig. 4b–d show ZnO nanosheets coated by CdS quantum dots after 10, 20 and 30 SILAR cycles, respectively. It can be clearly seen that the CdS nanoparticles were uniformly deposited onto the ZnO nanosheets. As the SILAR cycles increased, the CdS layer became correspondingly thicker. When the number of SILAR cycles increased to 30, the ZnO nanosheets were coated by CdS and porous CdS films were formed in some areas. These porous films would decrease the performance of the solar device as discussed later. The FESEM image and the corresponding EDXS spectrum of the CdS/ZnO nanostructures are presented in the ESI (Fig. S1†). From the EDXS results, the ratio of Cd:S is close to 1:1, indicating that the CdS/ZnO nanostructure was successfully constructed.

The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) performance of the sensitized solar cells assembled using CdS/ZnO/Ti nanostructures with varied CdS SILAR cycles are shown in Fig. 5. All I–V performance parameters are summarized in the ESI (Table S1†), demonstrating that the optimal CdS SILAR cycle on this photoanode was 20, with a conversion efficiency of 0.24%.

To improve the poor performance of CdS sensitized solar cells, CdSe QDs were then deposited with 7 SILAR cycles as described in our previous work44 to fabricate a CdSe/CdS/ZnO nanostructure. Fig. 6b shows the typical FESEM image of the CdSe/CdS/ZnO nanostructure, where the CdS and CdSe quantum dots were uniformly deposited, in sequence, on the surface of the ZnO nanosheets, compared to the bare ZnO nanosheets shown in Fig. 6a. To further determine the distribution of CdS and CdSe quantum dots, EDXS mappings of CdSe/CdS/ZnO nanostructures were performed (Fig. S2†), which indicated that the CdS and CdSe quantum dots were uniformly deposited on the surface of ZnO nanosheets. Meanwhile, the EDXS spectra of the CdSe/CdS/ZnO nanostructures were measured (Fig. S3†). The ratio of Cd:S:Se was determined to be close to 2:1:1, indicating that CdS and CdSe were formed with a stoichiometric composition.

The XRD spectra of ZnO, as-synthesized CdS/ZnO and CdSe/ZnO nanostructures are shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7c shows that the ZnO nanosheets grown on woven titanium wires have a hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure (JCPD 80-0074) corresponding to diffraction peaks of (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112), (201), (004) and (202). The strong and narrow diffraction peaks demonstrate good crystallinity. The appearance of no other diffraction peaks indicates the high phase purity. Fig. 7b shows the XRD pattern of CdS sensitized ZnO nanosheets after 20 SILAR cycles. It is observed that the CdS/ZnO nanostructure exhibits weak diffraction peaks at 2θ = 26.56°, 30.74°, 44.05°, and 52.11°, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes, respectively, of the CdS cubic phase crystal structure (JCPDS 80-0019). This result confirms the successful deposition of CdS nanoparticles on ZnO nanosheet arrays. As shown in Fig. 7a, the CdSe/ZnO nanostructure exhibits weak diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.3°, 42.0°, and 49.8°, corresponding to the (111), (220), and (311) planes of metastable cubic (sphalerite) CdSe (JCPDS no. 19-0191).

The light conversion properties of QD SSCs based on photoelectrodes (CdS/ZnO/Ti, CdSe/ZnO/Ti and CdSe/CdS/ZnO/Ti) using different CEs (Au, Cu2S, PbS and Pt) were characterized as shown in Fig. 8 and the details of the short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η) are included in the ESI (Table S2†). The CdSe/CdS co-sensitized solar cells show superior conversion efficiencies, demonstrating an increase of 300% and 346% compared to CdS and CdSe sensitized solar cells using Pt CEs, 83% and 179% using Au CEs, 95% and 199% using PbS CEs, 228% and 100% using Cu2S CEs, which were beyond the arithmetic addition of the efficiencies of single constituents (CdS and CdSe). This result could be ascribed to the introduction of CdSe QDs with a narrower bandgap (about 1.7 eV) compared with CdS (about 2.4 eV), which would give an enhanced light absorption at 400–750 nm and, therefore, increase the photocurrent of the solar cell.

The conversion efficiencies of CdSe/CdS co-sensitized solar cells with different CEs (Pt, Au, PbS and Cu2S) are shown in Fig. 9. By using the electrodes of PbS and Cu2S to replace the conventional Pt and Au CEs, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) improved from 0.3 V (Pt and Au) to 0.35 V (PbS) and 0.36 V (Cu2S) whereas the shortcircuit current density (JSC) improved from 12.32 mA cm−2 (Pt) and 7.58 mA cm−2 (Au) to 15.75 mA cm−2 (PbS) and 23.67 mA cm−2 (Cu2S) respectively. As a consequence of using these novel CEs, the CdSe/CdS co-sensitized samples using PbS and Cu2S CEs demonstrate power conversion efficiencies of 2.48% and 3.41%, indicating increases of 153% (PbS vs. Pt), 248% (Cu2S vs. Pt) and 368% (PbS vs. Au), 543% (Cu2S vs. Au).

This remarkable photovoltaic performance of the flexible CdS/CdSe quantum dot co-sensitized solar cells can be explained by the following reasons: (i) compared with traditional QD-sensitized solar cells based on fluorine-doped tin oxide conductive glass, the woven titanium wires exhibit a much lower internal resistance which would significantly improve the photovoltaic performance especially the current densities of the solar devices. (ii) Uniformly distributed CdS and CdSe quantum dots with good coverage on ZnO nanosheets would help to slow down the recombination process of the injected electrons from ZnO to the electrolyte, which is responsible for the increase of the conversion efficiencies. (iii) Previous studies have shown that the values of the lower edge of the conduction band for CdSe, CdS, and ZnO in bulk were around −4.25 eV, −3.98 eV and −4.19 eV, respectively, whereas the values of the upper edge of the valence band were around −5.95 eV, −6.23 eV and −7.39, respectively. The band gaps of CdSe, CdS, ZnO were 1.7 eV, 2.25 eV and 3.2 eV, respectively.2 Considering the Fermi level alignment, the electrons between CdS and CdSe were redistributed, which was supposed to trigger a downward shift of CdS band edges and an upward shift of CdSe band edges.32 Therefore, a step-like band edge structure of CdSe/CdS/ZnO as shown in Fig. 10 could be constructed. This structure demonstrates a cascade energy level structure in the order of ZnO < CdS < CdSe, whose aligned Fermi levels at the CdSe/CdS/ZnO interfaces facilitates electron injection for both inner CdS and outer CdSe layers. In addition, the introduction of CdSe QDs leads to an increase in light absorption in the visible range, which therefore enhances the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells. (iv) Compared with conventional Pt and Au CEs, the PbS and Cu2S CEs, which are less expensive alternatives, reveal relatively low charge transfer resistance between the polysulfide and the CEs. As a consequence of the fast charge transfer at the interface of the CE/electrolyte, the ions' concentration was changed. This change decreases the recombination rates and the concentration gradients of electrons and holes at the interface, which indicates enhanced catalytic activities of the Cu2S and PbS in conjunction with the polysulfide electrolyte and is responsible for improvements in the solar cell performances.33

In this study, the CdSe/CdS/ZnO nanostructures constructed on woven titanium wires were applied as photoanodes for flexible solar cell applications, which opens up the possibility of using low-cost inorganic semiconductors as alternatives to expensive organic dyes. The conversion efficiencies were impressive, whereas the redox limitations at the CE, which suffered from continual corrosion and ultimately mechanical instability, still limited the further improvement of the solar cells. Recent studies have shown that by applying composite material consisting of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and Cu2S as improved CEs, the problem at the CE-polysulfide interface may be partly solved.45
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, uniform zinc oxide (ZnO) nanosheet array nanosheets, co-sensitized by CdS and CdSe quantum dots via a SILAR method, were constructed on woven titanium wires, which were used as photoanodes for flexible QD-sensitized solar cells. By using novel PbS and Cu2S in place of conventional Pt and Au counter electrodes, the photovoltaic performance of solar cells was significantly improved, indicating conversion efficiencies of 2.48% and 3.41%, respectively, whereas the same photoelectrode together with Pt and Au CEs were unable to convert more than 1% of the solar energy into electrical power. Considering the redox limitations at the interface of the CE and the polysulfide and the charge transfer resistance properties of the alternative CEs, more suitable CEs are a prerequisite for further improvement of the conversion efficiencies of the polysulfide electrolyte-based flexible CdSe/CdS co-sensitized solar cells. This work is now in progress.
