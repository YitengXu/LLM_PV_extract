    , Accepted 14th April 2020First published on 14th April 2020AbstractOrganic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have reached high power conversion efficiencies, but they are usually processed using halogenated toxic solvents. Hence, before OPV devices can be mass-produced by industrial processing, it would be desirable to replace those solvents with eco-friendly ones. Theoretical tools may be then a powerful ally in the search for those new solvents. In order to better understand the mechanisms behind the interaction between solvent and polymer, classical molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were used to produce a thin film of poly(4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl) (PTB7-Th), processed using two different solvents. PTB7-Th is widely applied as a donor material in OPVs. The first solvent is ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), which is a highly toxic solvent widely used in lab-scale studies. The second solvent is ortho-methylanisole (o-MA), which is an eco-friendly solvent for organic photovoltaic (OPV) manufacturing. Here we use a solvent evaporation protocol to simulate the formation of the PTB7-Th film. We demonstrate that our theoretical MD calculations were able to capture some differences in the macroscopic properties of thin films formed by o-DCB or o-MA evaporation. We found that the interaction of the halogenated solvent with the polymer tends to break the bonds between the lateral thiophenediyl groups and the main chain. We show that those defects may create traps that can affect the charge transport and also can be responsible for a blue shift in the absorption spectrum. Using the Monte Carlo method, we also verified the influence of the resulting MD morphology on the mobility of holes. Our theoretical results showed good agreement with the experimental measurements and both demonstrate that o-MA can be used to make polymer thin films without any loss of key properties for the device performance. The findings here highlight the importance of theoretical results as a guide to the morphological optimization of green processed polymeric films.
1 Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have received great attention from the scientific community in recent years.1,2 Due to the advances in molecular engineering, new highly efficient donor and acceptor materials increased significantly the OPV performance.3–5 This exceptional breakthrough may transform OPVs into a viable and attractive source of renewable energy.6 However, some key issues need to be solved before OPV devices can be mass-produced by industrial processing.7 Among them is the use of halogenated solvents (and/or additives) with high toxicity.8,9 These solvents are generally used in lab-scale studies and have a good ability to dissolve organic materials. The challenge to replace them remains in the fact that the new solvents must dissolve organic semiconductors well. Otherwise, the poor solubility can give rise to unwanted features during device fabrication, like aggregate formation and changes in the viscosity during the coating process.10 These effects can severely limit the OPV photovoltaic response. Therefore the performance of solution-processable semiconducting devices is highly dependent on the solvent selection.11,12
High-performance OPVs have been reported with thin-film formation processed using highly toxic solvents.13 One solvent commonly employed to process OPV devices is ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB),14 which has the potential to generate human and environmental toxic effects derived from the chlorinated solution.15,16 The search to replace halogenated solvents motivated the use of ortho-methylanisole (o-MA), which is usually applied in the food industry. This substance is a strong candidate to be an eco-friendly solvent for OPV manufacturing since devices fabricated using o-MA did not lose performance. Some devices prepared using o-MA even showed active layers with a better morphology in small17 and large area coatings.18
To understand how the solvent can influence the formation of polymeric or molecular films, simulations of molecular dynamics (MD) play a fundamental role.19,20 For example, it was found by Tummala et al.21 that the use of additive solvents with a high-boiling point alters the size of PCBM aggregates in solution due to changes in the effective interactions of PCBM with the casting-solvent. Regarding the solvent evaporation process and morphological organization Alessandri et al.22 using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations developed a solvent evaporation protocol and demonstrated that it is possible to obtain morphologies consistent with experimental results.
In this work, we simulate via MD the formation of a PTB7-Th polymeric film through the evaporation process of solvents o-DCB and o-MA. We want to understand the effects introduced in the polymer film resulting from the interaction with the different solvents, and provide a basis for future implementations of and improvements in these materials that have great applicability in OPVs. With this aim, the force field theoretical parameters of the materials were adjusted, corroborating the solvents with reported experimental values. Subsequently, the solvent evaporation process is performed using a protocol to prepare the polymer layer. Then, energetic, morphological and electrical analyses were carried out on this layer. We surprisingly found that the interaction of the halogenated solvent with the polymer tends to break the bonds between the thiophenediyl lateral group and the hexagonal ring of the main chain. Our theoretical analyses are in good agreement with experimental measurements and demonstrate that the PTB7-Th film produced from o-MA has good morphological and electrical properties. Our study reveals the underlying mechanisms that make o-MA a viable alternative to halogenated solvents for the fabrication of photovoltaic devices. The replacement of halogenated solvents by green solvents preserving the performance of the polymeric film opens the possibility of the environmentally friendly industrial-scale production of OPVs.
The findings here highlight the importance of theoretical results as a guide to the morphological optimization of green processed polymeric films. Furthermore, due to the wide possibilities of the donor materials, the simulation method developed in this contribution can be applied as a tool before investigating the correct solvent to process the polymeric films, avoiding time, errors and cost spent in experimental methods. Therefore, we show that the properties of the computer-simulated film can successfully anticipate many important features of the real polymeric film.
2 Experimental methods
The PTB7-Th films were spin-coated on pre-cleaned glass from o-MA and o-DCB solutions with a concentration of 6.0 mg mL−1. Previously, the solutions were kept stirring at 60.0 °C overnight to ensure complete dissolution. The coating parameters were optimized so both films presented approximately the same thickness.
The hole-only device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th/MoO3/Ag) was fabricated as follows: a 40.0 nm-thick layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrenesulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated onto a pre-cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass substrate followed by annealing at 100.0 °C for 15.0 min. Then PTB7-Th solutions were spin-coated as described before. As a hole transport and electron blocking layer, MoO3 was thermally evaporated. Finally, a 200.0 nm-thick metal electrode layer was thermally evaporated.
The charge transport properties of the devices were evaluated using current versus voltage (J–V) curves. The thickness was determined through a Dektak 3 profilometer. The surface morphology of the PTB7-Th films coated from o-MA and o-DCB was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a Shimadzu SPM 9500J3 operating in dynamic mode.
3 Computational details
3.1 
          Ab initio calculations
The first step to characterize our theoretical model was to optimize the ground state geometry of the PTB7-Th oligomer and o-DCB and o-MA molecules (see Fig. 1) through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For this, we use the long-range corrected ωB97XD functional,23 which includes empirical dispersion that minimizes the delocalization error,24–26 together with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set.27,28 The long-range ωB97XD functional is able to reasonably describe noncovalent intramolecular interactions. Hence the potential energy curve derived from this functional produces a reasonably accurate torsional profile that will be applied to parametrize the polymer for the molecular dynamics calculations.29 The DFT simulations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.30

3.2 Classical molecular dynamics simulations
In the sequence, MD simulations were performed to simulate the systems composed of the optimized materials (oligomer chains + solvent molecules) using the united atom‡ (UA) representation.31 The MD simulations of this nano-scale system were performed using the GROMACS§ package,32 version 5.1.4.
The theoretical force field, usually employed to solve Newton's equations of motion during MD calculations, must be properly parameterized. In our computational model, this force field is described by eqn (1). The first four terms on the right side of eqn (1) describe classically the bonded interactions (covalent bonds, angles, and improper and proper dihedrals, respectively). The last two terms on the right side of this equation describe the non-bonded van der Waals and electrostatic interactions, represented by the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb equations, respectively. (1)
The parameters l0, θ0 and ξ0 in eqn (1) are the equilibrium values of the bond length, angle and improper dihedral angle, respectively. The parameters K refer to the elastic constants of the harmonic potentials and Cn are coefficients that adjust the fourth term of this equation (Ryckaert–Bellemans potential33) to the torsional energy profile. The variable rij and the parameters εij and σij represent the distance, energy and characteristic diameter between two particles i and j, respectively. εij and σij are obtained using the standard Lorentz–Berthelot rule,34,35 which defines  and σij = 0.5·(σii + σjj).
Among the force fields available in the literature, the parameters were taken from the table Optimized Potential for Liquid Simulations36–38 (OPLS), presented in the ESI.† The other missing parameters were included using DFT calculations. The snapshots were built with the Visual Molecular Dynamics39 (VMD) program. Some Fortran, python and Gnuplot routines were written to support the theoretical characterization of the materials. We also adapted a bash shell script based on the template available from Alessandri et al.22 to assist us in the simulated solvent evaporation process.
3.3 Material parametrization
The validation of the solvent model used in our MD calculations was done by optimizing the geometry of the o-DCB and o-MA molecules using partial atomic charges in the ESP40–43 formalism. Those partial charges were obtained from the DFT optimized molecular geometries. The other parameters necessary to characterize the solvent molecules were taken from the OPLS table. We performed two simulations for each solvent. The first simulation was done in the all atom (AA) representation to validate the force field. After this simulation, we calculate the mass density and vaporization enthalpy of the resulting solution and compare them with experimental data. The agreement between the calculated properties of the solution and measured data was our benchmark to gauge a successful parametrization of molecules in the AA model. To save computational costs, we then apply those parameters to describe the solvent molecules using the UA representation. The resulting parameters for the solution calculated in the UA model were again compared to experimental data.
In all cases, we carried out MD simulations following the basic steps described below. First, we performed an energy minimization during 1.0 × 107 steps of iteration using the steepest descent method44,45 to avoid overlapping of particles. In the sequence, we performed another DM simulation in the NPT ensemble for 20.0 ns to reach the thermodynamic equilibrium. We will then use this condition to calculate the properties of the solvent that will be compared to experimental data.
For the AA model, the initial volume of 512.0 nm3 (1000.0 nm3) is reduced to the mean of 180.0 nm3 (204.7 nm3) for solvent o-DCB (o-MA) at the end of the MD simulation. The macroscopic properties analyzed to validate our model are then the density of mass ρ and the variation of the vaporization enthalpy ΔHvap. The associated errors are +3.65% (−0.67%) for ρ and −1.25% (+1.53%) for ΔHvap of the o-DCB (o-MA) solvent. For the UA model, the volume behavior is similar, resulting in an associated error of +3.98% (+0.52%) for the o-DCB (o-MA) density of mass and +12.05% (−14.88%) for the o-DCB (o-MA) enthalpy. These theoretical results are included in Table 1 where the respective experimental values are in parentheses.

Our efficient parametrization of the solvents (evidenced by the good agreement between calculated and measured quantities) encouraged us to use MD calculations to determine the macroscopic properties of polymeric solutions. Therefore, we use the parameterized solvents to dissolve oligomers of the PTB7-Th polymer. With the help of those theoretical solutions, we applied then an MD protocol to simulate the solvent evaporation and the formation of a theoretical thin polymeric film. For more details about the computational simulations see the ESI.†
The parametrization of the PTB7-Th oligomer partial charges was obtained using DFT geometry optimization of two repeating units and using force field adjustment. The other parameters were taken from the OPLS table (ESI†) since the functional groups that constitute this polymer (like fluorenes, thiophenes, and carbonic side chains) are well described by the parameters in this table. Employing a python routine, the oligomers with two repeating units were then multiplied to form a chain with 12 repeating units (see Fig. 2). In the UA model, this chain comprises 696 particles (≈10.7 kDa). Another python routine was then used to measure the bond distances (l0) and angles (θ0) to write a GROMACS-compatible topology file format for this PTB7-Th oligomer.

3.4 Simulation of solvent evaporation
The simulation of solvent evaporation22,49 is a computational technique that involves the random removal of solvent molecules at discrete times until only the material constituting the solid remains, in this case, a thin film. We use a bash shell routine based on the model provided by Alessandri et al.22 We first simulated the evaporation of the o-DCB/PTB7-Th solution (S1 system). The simulation of solvent evaporation was done through 340 steps, i.e., 340 isolated simulations, and sequential MD in an isothermal–isobaric ensemble, with T = 298.15 K, resulting in a simulated physical time of 170.0 ns. For comparison, we also simulated the evaporation of the o-MA/PTB7-Th solution (S2 system). Those calculations required 328 MD steps for all solvent to be withdrawn, resulting in a total simulated evaporation time of 164.0 ns. In each step of evaporation, 1.25% molecules of solvent were randomly chosen to be removed from the S1 and S2 systems.
Although the evaporation of 1.25% of solvent every 0.5 ns can be considered ultra-fast,49 after each solvent extraction the system is left to quickly balance itself.50 Therefore, structures that minimized the potential energy can be reached despite the fast evaporation rate. Fig. 3 shows the time evolution of the S2 potential energy during the evaporation of o-DCB (the time evolution for the evaporation of system S2 is very similar to the curve in Fig. 3). In the first moments of the evaporation process (0.0–0.5 ns), there is a drastic variation of the potential energy induced by changes in the polymer morphology. After 50.0 ns of MD, the potential energy saturates, which indicates that there are no significant changes in the structures of the chains anymore. Some configurations of PTB7-Th oligomers during the solvent drying process are shown in Fig. 4. To improve the visualization of the solute, the solvent molecules were omitted in Fig. 4. Hence the blank spaces among the oligomers’ chains are spaces occupied by o-DCB molecules.

3.5 Calculation of the hole mobility
To investigate the hole-transport properties of polymers we use the Einstein relation for the hopping mobility of holes (h) in the low field limit:51 (2)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, e is the elementary charge and Dh is the diffusion coefficient of holes, given by: (3)where (R(t) − R(0)) is the distance between the carrier position at time t and the initial time at t = 0.0 ns.
To obtain Dh we perform Monte Carlo simulations,51 considering a random walk through sites of different oligomers with their respective probabilities (4)where kij is the hole transfer rate between sites i and j. The summation in the denominator of eqn (4) considers the n = 20 (see the ESI† for more details) first neighbors of oligomer i. kij between adjacent oligomers can be estimated within the framework of the semiclassical Marcus/Hush theory:52–54 (5)where λ and tij are the reorganization energy and transfer integral, respectively.55 The inner component of λ can be easily calculated from the adiabatic potential energy surfaces of the molecular states involved in the hole transfer process (details in the ESI†).56 We will consider 0.1 eV for the outer component of the reorganization energy, which is a physically plausible parameter for organic semiconductors in accordance with other work.57,58 Considering an oligomer of PTB7-Th with three units of repetition in our calculations, we obtained λ = 0.34 eV.
To greatly reduce the computational cost that is involved in the individual calculation of tij for each pair of oligomers considered (4950 pairs), we opted to parameterize the values of tij. We considered an ideal pair of oligomers interacting with variable separation distances and calculated the transfer integral at each distance, see Fig. S10(a) in the ESI.† We then fitted a curve to the calculated points to determine the continuous variation of tij with the separation distance between the oligomers. As expected, we found an exponential decrease of tij with increasing distance.55 Although our approach to determine tij neglects the orientation angle between the pairs of oligomers (which can also modify the magnitude of tij), it is accurate enough to provide reasonable values for the mobility as demonstrated below (see Section 4.3). We use, then, the last stored configuration of the thin film resulting from the MD evaporation to calculate the interaction distance between adjacent oligomers and the distance between centers of mass (CM), Rinter. Once the value of Rinter is found, we then use the curve in Fig. S10(a) (ESI†) to calculate the magnitude of kij for each pair of oligomers.
4 Results and discussion
In this section, we will discuss the main features of the theoretical S1 and S2 thin films, always trying to correlate those properties with experimental data when available.
4.1 Energies
After the solvent evaporation, there is a relevant difference between the total internal energies of systems S1 and S2 (see the time-dependent evolution of the total energy at the top of Fig. 5). Although the oligomers started from the same initial configuration in both systems, the variation in total energy clearly reflects morphological differences in the films produced by the evaporation of different solvents. From the energy equipartition principle, the kinetic energy is similar in both systems. Therefore, the difference in the total internal energy is entirely due to changes in potential energy. The contributions to the potential energy involve bonded and non-bonded interactions (see eqn (1)). In Fig. 5 we plotted the time evolution of the total potential energy for both systems (top panel). We also separate the contributions to this energy from bonded and non-bonded interactions (middle and bottom panels of Fig. 5, respectively). The system S1 has higher potential energy compared to S2. From Fig. 5 it is clear that the major contribution to their difference derives from bonded interactions, mostly covalent bonds with approximately 67.7% of the total energy difference.
 Fig. 5  Evolution of the total and potential energies during the simulated solvent evaporation process for both systems. The values refer to all particles in the system at a given time. The blue curve represents the energy difference between the systems 1 and 2 and its scale is related to the right axis. 
In an attempt to identify the bonds responsible for the differences in the potential energy, we analyzed some selected bonds involving atoms with the greatest number of degrees of freedom, i.e., those involving simple covalent bonds. Some of those bonds are distributed along the backbone and others are connected to the thiophene rings in the side chains, as shown in Fig. 6(a). We then isolated the indexes of each pair of atoms involved in these bonds to determine the bond length. Except for a few bonds (see the ESI†), the great majority of the bond lengths matched what was initially defined by the initial parameterization of the oligomers. Yet the exceptions have slightly longer lengths, which indicate that some chemical bonds in the S1 system are more stretched than they should be. Fig. 6(b) shows the average distribution of connection lengths shown in Fig. 6(a). Note the presence of a great number of bond lengths with large deviations from l0 in the S1 system. From these calculations, we also identified that the side thiophene ring connections are responsible for these abnormalities.
 Fig. 6  (a) Identification of single bonds along the polymer backbone and (b) the average distribution of probabilities around the equilibrium length. 
One possible explanation of this effect may be related to the modification of the interactions between the solvent molecule and the conjugated π system due to the presence of halogen atoms in the solvent. For instance, it was observed that the substitution of hydrogen of methane by halogen atoms considerably changes both the electrostatic and dispersion energies when this solvent interacts with a conjugated molecule.59 In particular, the substitution by chlorine atoms greatly increases the dispersion interaction, not only by enhancing the depths of the interaction potentials significantly but also by greatly increasing the attraction when the molecules are well-separated. Such a dispersion-related attraction effect may be the mechanism behind the stretching of some bonds in the S1 system. Moreover, given the large number of degrees of freedom of the studied polymer, its side chains can intertwine60 during the simulated evaporation process, which increases the torsional energy and, consequently, the potential bonding energy.60
Here it is important to point out that the theoretical model of this study simulates a non-reactive system, i.e., the chemical bond is approximated by a quadratic harmonic potential (the first term of eqn (1)). This model does not allow the breaking of the bond with increasing distance. Some of these stretched bonds in Fig. 6(b) may have been broken during the evaporation process, which would produce smaller oligomers or even free radicals with smaller energy than the original stretched chain. This effect may induce the appearance of conjugated defects in the polymer after the evaporation of the halogenated solvent. As a simple way to consider this effect we perform a DFT simulation of an oligomer of PTB7-Th without one thiophenediyl side group and compared it with an oligomer of PTB7-Th without any defect (see Fig. S7, ESI†). Our results showed that the energy of the hole transport level for the defective PTB7-Th is deeper compared to the PTB7-Th without defects. Therefore this kind of defect may create traps that can affect the charge transport. Besides that, an increase in the energy gap was observed for the oligomer of PTB7-Th without one thiophenediyl side group. This result is in agreement with the literature since it was observed that the absorption spectrum of the PTB7-Th film produced with o-DCB is blue-shifted compared to the absorption spectrum of the film produced with o-MA.17
4.2 Morphology

Density of mass. 
After solvent evaporation, the thickness of the simulated polymeric thin film along the Z-axis was determined by density of mass analysis. It was found that the thickness of the S2 film is 0.482 nm longer than the thickness of the S1 film. This difference is justified by the fact that the polymer chains in S2 are more stretched and occupy a greater volume. Another interesting result was found by analyzing the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) of both systems. The SASA analysis showed that the accessible area is higher for the S2 system, indicating again that the film formed after the green solvent evaporation has a lower mass density. Details of these results are presented in the ESI.† Optical measurements of PTB7-Th thin films gave indirect evidence that supports those results. The absorption coefficient of the film processed using o-MA is lower compared to the absorption coefficient of the film processed using o-DCB.17 It is known that the absorption coefficient of a thin film tends to decrease with decreasing mass density. This result is experimental evidence that the film formed after the green solvent evaporation has a lower density compared to the film produced with the halogenated solvent.12,61


Surface roughness. 
We analyzed the polymeric thin film surfaces and compared them with the experimental results obtained from AFM measurements of the experimental PTB7-Th film. We first obtain the images of surface height contrast for the S1 and S2 systems by isolating the highest Z-coordinates of the oligomers which correspond to the top surface of the film. Fig. 7 shows a two- and three-dimensional graph of those coordinates. We then use the free software Gwyddion (available at http://gwyddion.net/) to obtain some parameters from the 2D images such as average roughness (Ra), root mean square roughness (RMS or Rq), relative roughness (Rz) and surface area. We also show in Fig. 7 the AFM images of the experimental thin films. In Table 2 we compare the parameters obtained using AFM measurements of the real film with the same parameters calculated for the MD simulated film.

From the experimental results, Ra and Rq of the film produced with o-MA are two times larger than those of the film produced with o-DCB. The same trend was obtained in the simulations. All the parameters extracted from an AFM-like hypothetical analysis of the theoretical results indicate that the values for the S2 system are approximately twice as large as those for the S1 system. Although the calculated results are an order of magnitude lower than those obtained experimentally (due to the smaller size of the simulated film), the simulation can reproduce the same trends observed in the experiments. This result demonstrates the power of MD simulations combined with the solvent evaporation method to anticipate the important properties of the real film. Our results indicate that the polymeric films formed by green solvent evaporation tend to have a larger contact area with the electron acceptor material in bilayer devices for example. This effect improves the photocurrent generation in those kinds of solar cells.62,63 For a bulk heterojunction device, the higher free space between the polymer chains during the blend formation may allow the penetration of the acceptor molecule into the inner part of the polymeric phase.17 The better molecular miscibility between the materials of the blend together with suitable interpenetrating networks can increase the probability of exciton dissociation.64

4.3 Charge transport
In this section, we will verify the influence of morphology on the mobility of holes through Monte Carlo simulations. First, we calculate the trajectories of the holes in the thin films and then the mean squared displacement (MSD). The MSD in the S1 and S2 systems is shown in Fig. 8(a). The diffusion coefficient Dh is calculated by a straight line fitting of the data from Fig. 8(a) in the 5.0 to 10.0 ns time interval. The angular coefficient is equivalent to 6·Dh, as shown in eqn (3) (more details of these calculations are available in the ESI†). Using this result we get Dh(S1) = 4.893 × 10−5 cm2 s−1(6)and Dh(S2) = 1.289 × 10−4 cm2 s−1.(7)By eqn (2) we found the hole mobilities shown in Fig. 8(a).
 Fig. 8  (a) MSD of holes from Monte Carlo simulations for both systems. The linear adjustment (black lines) is performed from 5.0 to 10.0 ns. (b) Experimental current versus voltage to measure the hole mobility and the fit was performed in the region where J ∝ (V − Vbi)2 (Mott–Gurney law65). 
Our results are in fair agreement with the experimental values found by applying the Mott–Gurney law65 to the data of Fig. 8(b). Besides, the theoretical mobility is higher for the S2 system (μh ≈ 5.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared to the S1 system (μh ≈ 1.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). Indeed the experimental data of Fig. 8(b) have the same trend since the film processed using o-MA had higher hole mobility (≈2.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) than the film processed using o-DCB (≈1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). The theoretical variation was slightly higher compared to the experimental one probably because our calculations neglect the variations of tij associated with the different orientations of the adjacent i and j states. Our calculations also ignored electronic correlation effects derived from the occupation of the transport levels and energetic shifts of those levels induced by conjugation defects along the polymeric chain. Another important point is that the experimental mobility was obtained using space charge effects that occur at high electric fields (our calculations were performed assuming a pure diffusive motion). Yet our simple approach (which uses the Monte Carlo method for charge transport in a state morphology resulting from MD simulations) gave mobility values that are close to the experimental ones. In addition, it was able to detect subtle variations in the mobilities that were observed in real films.66,67
In order to understand the reasons behind the differences in the hole mobility between S1 and S2, we calculated the torsion profile of the chemical groups along the oligomer backbone. The results showed that the oligomers of S2 are slightly more planar than the oligomers of S1. This result was obtained by analyzing the dihedral angles along the oligomers’ chain. As expected, the tendency towards planarity of the film produced with o-MA resulted in slightly higher hole mobility since this effect favors a higher π–π coupling between adjacent chains.
We also analyzed the radial pair distribution for the films. We saw that the probability of finding identical CMs is slightly higher in the first solvation layer of the thin film treated with the green solvent, S2 (see Fig. S9, ESI†). This may indicate that the oligomers are more packed in this system, once again evidencing their tendency towards planarity.
5 Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated that the MD simulations developed in this contribution are efficient to capture the main features of a real polymeric film formed by solvent evaporation. From our approach, it was possible to better understand the mechanisms behind the interaction between the solvent and polymer and how they affect important parameters for the fabrication of OPVs. For instance, we found that the interaction between the halogenated solvent and the polymer tends to stretch some bonds along the polymer chain. In a real polymeric chain, this effect would break the conjugation length, which would limit the conjugation of the system. This effect can produce traps for charge transport and an increase in the energy gap. It was also possible to have a deeper understanding of the influence of the film morphology on properties related to surface roughness and hole mobility. In addition, based on both theoretical and experimental results, it is clear that the non-halogenated solvent o-MA can be used to make thin films without any loss in electrical and morphological properties when compared to the halogenated solvent o-DCB. Thus we believe that large-scale production of organic solar cells can be performed in a more environmentally friendly manner, in greater accordance with its initial proposal of clean and sustainable energy.
