    , Accepted 11th July 2021First published on 12th July 2021AbstractThe electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) is a promising alternative to the industrial synthesis of nitrate. However, with the enhancement of NOR activity by modification methods, the competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is always improved simultaneously. Here, a hybrid electrocatalyst composed of Au nanoparticles and oxygen vacancy-enriched niobium oxide nanobelts (Au–Nb2O5−x) was prepared on niobium foil for N2 fixation into NO3−. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) demonstrate that electron transfer occurs between Au nanoparticles and the oxygen vacancies in Nb2O5−x nanobelts, which adjusts the electronic structures of oxygen vacancies near the Au/Nb2O5−x interface. Electrochemical and N2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) tests indicate that the optimization of the electronic structure suppresses the activity of the competitive OER on oxygen vacancy sites and facilitates nitrogen adsorption on the surface of Au–Nb2O5−x, which significantly enhances the NOR performance of the electrocatalyst.
Introduction
Nitrogen compounds are fundamental raw ingredients in the daily life of human beings and industrial processes. Presently, the commercial ammonia and nitrate are produced by the Haber–Bosch process and Ostwald process respectively, which require extreme conditions with enormous energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission.1 Thus, it's significant to search for novel possible routes for nitrogen conversion which can minimize the need for fossil fuels.2 Theoretically, nitrogen can be directly converted to ammonia and nitrate under ambient conditions by using an electrochemical technique which can be powered by renewable energy without any environmental pollution. This has been considered as one of the most promising alternative methods.3 What's more, a cost-effective electrochemical cell can be constructed by coupling the N2 reduction reaction (NRR) with the N2 oxidation reaction (NOR), which only consumes ambient N2 and water as the feedstocks and yields aqueous NH4NO3.4 To date, substantial research has been reported to develop efficient NRR electrocatalysts,5–19 while the exploration for NOR electrocatalysts is far from satisfactory.4,20–23
The oxidation reaction of nitrogen can be divided into two main steps: the first step is the conversion of nitrogen gas into the NO* intermediate and the second step is the transformation of NO* to nitrate.22 The former is an electrocatalytic process being considered as the rate-limiting step, whereas, the latter is a non-electrochemical redox reaction with H2O and the generated O2 from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the competitive reaction in the first step.4 Therefore, it's essential to rationally adjust the activity and selectivity of active sites toward the NOR and OER for designing highly efficient NOR electrocatalysts.
The activity and selectivity of active sites is mainly determined by the surface electronic structure of catalysts, which can be adjusted by various methods, including elemental doping, defect engineering, constructing heterojunctions and so on.24–27 So far, several efforts have been made to improve NOR performance by adjusting the electronic structure of electrocatalysts. For example, Yan et al. doped Ru into the TiO2 lattice to modify the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst leading to the improvement of the first step of the NOR, while the over-doped Ru formed extra RuO2 and promoted the OER.4 With the enhancement of both steps of the NOR, the electrocatalyst exhibited excellent performance. Additionally, Xu et al. modulated the oxidation state of Co by tuning the atomic ratio in ZnFexCo2−xO4, demonstrating that the highest NOR performance was achieved at ZnFe0.4Co1.6O4 with the highest Co oxidation state.20 However, in both the studies, with the improvement of the NOR activity of active sites, the OER activity was simultaneously promoted. Considering the relatively low faradaic efficiency of the NOR, the OER is still the main reaction on the surface of the electrocatalyst. Thence, more research studies are needed to adjust the selectivity of active sites toward the NOR to further enhance the performance of electrocatalysts.
Herein, Au nanoparticles (NPs) were hybridized with oxygen vacancy-enriched Nb2O5−x nanobelts to adjust the selectivity of oxygen vacancy sites toward the NOR, which leads to the significant promotion of NOR performance. In detail, an in situ synthesis method was adopted to prepare Nb2O5 nanobelts on the surface of niobium foil. Then, oxygen vacancies were introduced to form Nb2O5−x nanobelts, which were further hybridized with Au NPs. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) test results show that electrons transfer from Au to Nb2O5−x and pair with the single electrons in oxygen vacancies. The results of N2-TPD and electrochemical experiments reveal that the electron transfer plays a vital role in promoting the NOR performance of the electrocatalyst. On one hand, oxygen vacancies in Nb2O5−x can provide active sites for the NOR. However, on the other hand, oxygen vacancies also promote the competitive OER to some extent. Thanks to the electron transfer between Au and Nb2O5−x, the electronic structure of active sites near the Au/Nb2O5−x interface is adjusted, which not only inhibits the OER activity of oxygen vacancy sites and modifies the selectivity toward the NOR, but also facilitates nitrogen adsorption on the surface of Au–Nb2O5−x. As a result, the Au–Nb2O5−x nanobelt hybrid exhibits excellent NOR activity with a high NO3− yield rate of 2.29 μg h−1 cmcat.−2 at 2.4 V and a faradaic efficiency of 9.8% at 2.2 V in neutral Na2SO4 electrolyte.

HAuCl4·H2O, NaBH4, Na2SO4, HCl, NH2SO3H, Na2CO3 (GR), NaHCO3 (GR), D2O and Na15NO3 were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co. Ltd. All the reagents were used as received without further purification. 5% H2/95% Ar mixed gas, high purity N2 (99.999%) and high purity Ar (99.99%) were purchased from Nanjing Tianze Gases Co. Ltd. 15N2 (99%) was purchased from Wuhan Newradar special gas Co. Ltd. Niobium foil (99.98%) was provided by Haoxuan Metal Company, Qinghe, China. The Nafion 115 membrane (DuPont) was purchased from HESEN Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
Synthesis of Nb2O5 nanobelts and Nb2O5−x nanobelts
The Nb2O5 nanobelts on niobium foil were synthesized by an in situ hydrothermal reaction. Typically, a piece of commercial niobium foil (1 cm × 3 cm) was ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, ethanol and deionized water sequentially several times to make sure its surface was cleaned. Then the Nb foil was dried under N2 flow. The surface cleaned Nb foil was immersed in 30 mL of 1.6 M urea solution in a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated to 200 °C and kept for 24 hours. After cooling naturally to room temperature, the processed Nb foil was taken out with a white product (NH4Nb3O8 nanobelts) covering on its surface, washed with deionized water and ethanol to remove surface impurities and dried overnight. Finally, the as-prepared Nb foil was annealed in a furnace for 1 h at 450 °C in air. The as-prepared Nb2O5 nanobelts were put in the center of a tube furnace and calcined for 2 h at 450 °C under 5% H2/95% Ar flow to obtain Nb2O5−x nanobelts.
Synthesis of the Au–Nb2O5−x hybrid and Au–Nb2O5 hybrid
Typically, a piece of as-prepared Nb2O5−x nanobelts (1 × 3 cm) was put into a porous bag and immersed into 30 mL water. Then 200 μL HAuCl4 solution (10 mg mL−1) was slowly added into the above beaker with magnetic stirring. After that, NaBH4 (30 mg) was slowly added into the above solution with strong magnetic stirring for 30 minutes. Finally, the sample was taken out, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times and dried under N2 flow. The Au–Nb2O5−x nanobelt hybrid was obtained. The Au–Nb2O5 nanobelt hybrid was prepared in a similar way by using Nb2O5 nanobelts as the support.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded by using a Rigaku Ultima III X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed on a Hitachi S-3400NIIfield emission scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by using a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a ULVAC PHI 5000 Versa Probe instrument. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were performed on a Bruker EMX 10/12 instrument. To determine the quantity of Au atoms in the Au–Nb2O5 hybrid and Au–Nb2O5−x hybrid, the samples were dissolved in aqua regia and the solution was analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, PE Avio500). N2 temperature-programmed desorption (N2-TPD) experiments were conducted on an Autosorb-iQ-C chemisorption analyser (Quantachrome, USA).
Electrochemical measurements
All electrochemical tests were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua). A standard three-electrode system was adopted with the synthesized samples used as the working electrode, a graphite rod was used as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl electrode (3.5 M KCl) served as the reference electrode. 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous served as the electrolyte for all measurements.
Electrocatalytic NOR tests were carried out in a gas-tight, two-compartment cell under ambient conditions, which was separated by a Nafion 115 membrane. Before the test, the Nafion membrane was pre-treated sequentially by heating in 5 wt% H2O2 solution, ultrapure water, 5 wt% H2SO4 and ultrapure water at 80 °C for 1 h respectively. And between each test, the Nafion membrane was boiled in ultrapure water to remove possible contamination. The volume of electrolyte was 30 mL in both cells. High purity N2, Ar and 15N2 isotope gas were pre-purified by sequentially passing through a 0.1 M NaOH solution and a 0.1 M H2SO4 solution to remove any possible sources of N contamination, and subsequently purged into the anode compartment for 30 min before tests to form the N2-saturated or Ar-saturated solution.
Chronoamperometry curves were recorded for 2 h at different potentials using the electrochemical workstation with continuous N2 feeding. The potentials were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale based on the equation:E (vs. RHE) = E (vs. Ag/AgCl) + 0.0591 × pH + 0.2046
Linear-sweep voltammogram (LSV) tests were performed with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in N2-saturated or Ar-saturated electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out at −0.5 V (vs. RHE) with the sweeping frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz in N2-saturated electrolyte.
Determination of NO3− yields and faradaic efficiencies
The concentration of produced nitrate was detected and quantified by ion chromatography (Shenghan CIC-D100). The yield rate of nitrate production was calculated by the following equation:NO3− yield = (c × V) / (t × areacat.)where c is the increased mass concentration of nitrate; V is the volume of the electrolyte; t is the electrochemical oxidation reaction time; areacat. is the geometric area of the electrocatalyst.
The content of produced nitrate was further confirmed by the ultraviolet (UV) method. In detail, 0.1 mL 1 M HCl and 0.01 mL 0.8 wt% sulfamic acid solution were added into 5 mL electrolyte. The UV absorption spectrum was obtained and absorption intensities at wavelengths of 220 and 275 nm were recorded.21 The final absorbance value was calculated by the equation:A = A220nm − 2A275nm
The faradaic efficiencies (FE) of nitrate yield can be calculated as follows:FE = (5 × F × c × V)/(M × Q)where F is the Faraday constant; c is the increased mass concentration of nitrate; V is the volume of the electrolyte; M is the relative molecular mass of nitrate and Q is the total charge passed through the electrode during the electrolysis.

15N2 isotope labelling
For isotope labelling experiments, we applied a method of batch experiment. The Au–Nb2O5−x nanobelt hybrid with the effective area of 3 cm2 was subjected to the NOR test at 2.4 V for 6 h using 15N2 as the feeding gas for 10 consecutive times. All the electrolyte was collected and freeze-dried to remove water. The obtained powder was dissolved in D2O and analysed by 15N nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR, Bruker ADVANCE III).
Results and discussion
The preparation process of the Au–Nb2O5−x nanobelt hybrid catalyst is illustrated in Fig. 1. Briefly, the NH4Nb3O8 nanobelts were in situ synthesized on the surface of niobium foil by a hydrothermal reaction, and were then calcined under an air atmosphere to obtain Nb2O5 nanobelts. After that, the as-prepared niobium foil underwent further annealing treatment under a 5% H2/95% Ar atmosphere to introduce oxygen vacancies into the nanobelts. Finally, the Nb2O5−x nanobelts with Nb foil were immersed in HAuCl4 solution and NaBH4 was added as the reducing agent to obtain the Au nanoparticle-loaded Nb2O5−x nanobelt.

SEM images of Nb2O5 nanobelts are shown in Fig. S1,† which shows that a large number of uniform nanobelts densely cover the surface of Nb foil. What's more, the nanobelts exhibit a specific morphology with lengths of dozens of micrometers, which is beneficial to expose more surface active sites.28 After annealing treatment, Nb2O5−x nanobelts maintain the pristine morphology of Nb2O5 nanobelts without any break (Fig. 2a and b). The XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 2c. The diffraction peaks of Nb2O5 nanobelts can be assigned to the orthorhombic Nb2O5 (JCPDS no. 27-1003). Notably, compared with the standard card, the intensity of the diffraction peak indexed to the (180) plane is extremely strong, which indicates that there are a large number of (180) facets exposed on the surface Nb2O5 due to its specific belt morphology. The phase of the Nb2O5−x nanobelts does not change after annealing treatment due to the same XRD pattern as the pristine one. However, there are no new diffraction peaks after the hybridization of Au NPs with Nb2O5−x nanobelts because of the small size and low content of Au NPs.29,30

The detailed structural features of the samples were analysed by TEM. As shown in Fig. 3a, the width of the individual Nb2O5 nanobelt is about 100 nm. To confirm the exposed facet of the Nb2O5 nanobelts, a turnover area (red square area, Fig. 3b) was chosen to observe its side surface. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 3c) of the area shows that the lattice spacing of the longitudinal direction is 0.315 nm, indexing to the (180) plane of orthorhombic Nb2O5, which suggests that the {180} facet is the major exposed surface of Nb2O5 nanobelts and is consistent with the XRD pattern. The front surface of the Nb2O5 nanobelt (yellow square area, Fig. 3a) was also observed and the HRTEM image is shown in Fig. 3d. The horizontal lattice fringe can be attributed to the (001) plane of orthorhombic Nb2O5, indicating that the growth direction of the nanobelts is [001] orientation.31 Notably, the surface of the nanobelts is full of stacking faults due to the phase transformation from NH4Nb3O8 to Nb2O5, which extracted NH4+ from the interlayer space between [NbO6] octahedral sheets and evolved into stacking faults.32 The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3e) reveals that the Nb2O5 nanobelts present a single crystal structure and adopt an orthorhombic structure, which is also consistent with the XRD pattern. Additionally, it can be noticed that several sets of diffraction dots are nested together, which is consistent with the existence of stacking faults in the nanobelts. The Nb2O5−x nanobelts exhibit the same lattice structure as the Nb2O5 nanobelts (Fig. S2†), which suggests that the introduction of oxygen vacancies doesn't damage the lattice structure of the nanobelts.

As shown in Fig. 4a and b, Au NPs are observed to be evenly decorated on the surface of Nb2O5−x nanobelts, and clear lattice fringes can be observed with a lattice spacing of 0.235 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of Au. What's more, the high-angel annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image of Au–Nb2O5−x is shown in Fig. 4c and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images are presented in Fig. 4d–f, which clearly reveal the homogeneous element distribution of Au (yellow), Nb (red) and O (green). As the control experiment, Au–Nb2O5 nanobelts were also synthesized and the TEM images are shown in Fig. S3.† Additionally, the loading contents of Au are 0.62 wt% and 0.59 wt% for Au–Nb2O5−x and Au–Nb2O5 respectively (Table S1†) measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ICP-MS.

To investigate chemical states of elements of the samples, XPS measurements were carried out (Fig. S4†). The high-resolution XPS of O 1 s are displayed in Fig. 5a. The spectrum of Nb2O5 is able to be fitted into one peak located at 530.34 eV, which is attributed to the lattice oxygen in Nb2O5.33 There are two new fitted peaks in the spectrum of Nb2O5−x located at 531.45 eV and 532.95 eV, which are attributed to oxygen vacancies caused by annealing treatment and the physisorbed water, respectively.34 High-resolution XPS spectra of Nb 3d are shown in Fig. 5b. The spectrum of Nb2O5 is able to be fitted into two peaks located at 207.12 eV and 209.82 eV, respectively. Compared to the pristine Nb2O5, the peaks of Nb2O5−x shift to lower binding energies of 206.95 eV and 209.73 eV, suggesting the decrease in the oxidation state of niobium due to the introduction of oxygen vacancies.33,35 Notably, after being hybridized with Au NPs, the binding energy of Nb 3d peaks continues to decrease to 206.85 eV and 209.65 eV. Further, as exhibited in Fig. 5c, the peaks of Au 4f for Au–Nb2O5−x show higher binding energy (83.53 eV and 87.27 eV) than those of Au–Nb2O5 (83.31 eV and 86.93 eV). These phenomena suggest the transfer of electrons from Au to Nb2O5−x, which originates from the strong interaction between the two components at the interface.36–39 As a control experiment, the binding energies of Nb 3d peaks for the pristine Nb2O5 and Au–Nb2O5 were also compared (Fig. S5†). There is almost no difference in binding energy, indicating the extremely weak interaction between them.40,41

EPR measurements were also carried out to evaluate the amount of unpaired electrons in the samples (Fig. 5d). There is no signal for the pristine Nb2O5, while Nb2O5−x exhibits a significant EPR signal at g = 2.003, which further identifies the successful introduction of oxygen vacancies.29,35 Notably, the EPR signal of Nb2O5−x decreases after Au loading, which is attributed to the coupling of the unpaired electron at the Au/Nb2O5−x interface.38,42,43 However, there is still no signal for Nb2O5 after Au loading, indicating no electron coupling between them. Therefore, the above XPS and EPR results clearly revel that electrons transfer from Au to Nb2O5−x at the hybrid interface and finally pair with the single electrons in the oxygen vacancies of Nb2O5−x, which may play a vital role in altering the electrocatalytic properties of Au–Nb2O5−x.42,44 What's more, EIS measurements were also carried out (Fig. S6†). The results show that due to the introduction of oxygen vacancies the electrical conductivity of Nb2O5−x is inherently enhanced, which can increase the charge transfer and facilitate the electrocatalytic performance.37,45
Electrocatalytic NOR tests were carried out in a gas-tight H-type cell separated by a Nafion 115 membrane under ambient conditions (Fig. S7†). The Nb foil (1 cm × 1 cm) covered with the electrocatalyst was used as the working electrode and 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. Pre-purified high-purity N2 (99.999%) was continually bubbled into the anode compartment during the test. To ensure the reliability of our data, a series of strict procedures have been adopted for each NOR test, including pre-detection of the concentration of the nitrate in electrolyte, pre-purification of the gas before bubbling into the electrolyte to remove any possible sources of N contamination, and pre-treatment of the Nafion membrane to avoid the influence of possibly adsorbed pollutants. The concentration of produced nitrate was detected and quantified by ion chromatography (IC) and further confirmed by the UV method. The calibration curves are shown in Fig. S8 and S11† (the range of the peak area is also indicated in Fig. S8†).
Fig. S12† shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of Au–Nb2O5−x nanobelts, where a moderate enhancement in current density can be witnessed in the N2-saturated electrolyte compared to that in Ar-saturated electrolyte, suggesting the possibility of nitrogen electro-oxidation. Therefore, NOR performance tests for Au–Nb2O5−x nanobelts were carried out at various applied potentials ranging from 2.2 V to 2.5 V. The corresponding chronoamperometry curves are shown in Fig. S13† and the current density increased with the applied potential. In each test, the initial and finial concentrations of nitrate in the anode electrolyte were detected and the IC curves and the corresponding peak area are shown in Fig. S14 and Table S3.† According to the above chronoamperometry curves and the IC data, the NO3− yield rates and faradaic efficiencies (FE) at different potentials are plotted in Fig. 6a. The highest NO3− yield rate of 2.29 μg h−1 cmcat.−2 was obtained at 2.4 V, while the maximum FE of 9.8% was achieved at 2.2 V. With increasing the applied potential, the value of FE gradually decreases, which is due to the serious competition of the OER at high potential leading to the low selectivity of the NOR. The above yield rates were further confirmed by the UV method (Fig. S15†). What's more, to verify the continuous yield of nitrate, time-dependent NOR tests for Au–Nb2O5−x nanobelts were performed. The concentration of nitrate increases with the operating time (Fig. 6b and Table S4†). The total nitrate yield increases almost linearly from 2 h to 6 h and the corresponding FEs only suffer a little decline (Fig. 6c and S16†). The yields were also further confirmed by the UV method (Fig. S17†).

Further, to evaluate the stability of the electrocatalyst, cycle tests were conducted at the applied potential of 2.4 V. As depicted in Fig. S18 and Table S5,† there is only a minimal decrease in the nitrate yields and FEs and the current density remains stable during the long period test. Simultaneously, the stability of Au–Nb2O5−x nanobelts can also be confirmed by a series of characterization data. As shown in Fig. S19 and S20,† the morphology and the structure of the electrocatalyst also remain unchanged after the cycling NOR test. Therefore, all of these results suggest the high stability of Au–Nb2O5−x nanobelts in the electrocatalytic NOR.
To clarify the source of the produced nitrate, control experiments were conducted. The Au–Nb2O5−x nanobelts were tested in Ar-saturated electrolyte at 2.4 V and N2-saturated electrolyte with an open-circuit. The initial and finial concentrations of nitrate in the anode electrolyte were detected and are exhibited in Fig. S21 and Table S6.† Both of the results show no increment in the concentration of NO3−, indicating that the addition of nitrate concentration originates from the electrocatalytic NOR. To further exclude the possible influence, the 15N2 isotopic labelling experiment was conducted. The Au–Nb2O5−x nanobelts were subjected to the NOR test at 2.4 V with 15N2 feeding and a typical 15NO3− signal can be observed in the product from the 15N nuclear magnetic resonance (15N-NMR) spectrum (Fig. 6d). Thus, it can be concluded that the increment of nitrate concentration in the anode electrolyte was indeed derived from the electrocatalytic NOR.
To explore the origin of the NOR activity of Au–Nb2O5−x nanobelts, sufficiently controlled experiments were carried out. As displayed in Fig. 6e, S22 and Table S7,† niobium foil is almost inactive for the NOR and the pristine Nb2O5 also shows an extremely low activity with the nitrate yield rate of 0.36 μg h−1 cmcat.−2. The NOR performance of pristine Nb2O5 is improved by either introducing oxygen vacancies or loading Au NPs. The nitrate yield rates achieved 1.06 μg h−1 cmcat.−2 and 0.91 μg h−1 cmcat.−2 respectively. Notably, when hybridizing Au with Nb2O5−x nanobelts, the NOR activity of the electrocatalyst is significantly improved and the promotion is greater than the addition of the two single methods. The above yield rates were also further confirmed by the UV method (Fig. S23†). Additionally, LSV curves of the samples were also obtained in N2-saturated 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution. The current density of the LSV curves can reflect the activity of the oxidation reaction on the surface of the anode. In our system, according to the FE, the contribution of the OER is about 90% to the total current density, while the contribution of the NOR is about 10%. Therefore, the significant change in current density can be attributed to the variation of the activity of the OER, while the moderate change in current density can be attributed to that of the NOR. As shown in Fig. 6f, with the introduction of oxygen vacancies, the current density of Nb2O5−x is significantly increased, which suggests that the OER activity is greatly enhanced. Combined with the results of NOR performance tests, it can be concluded that oxygen vacancies can simultaneously serve as active sites for the NOR and OER, whereas, after loading Au NPs, there is only a little increment in the current density of Au–Nb2O5. Considering the results of NOR performance tests, the increment in current density is attributed to the enhancement of the NOR, suggesting that Au NPs can only serve as active sites for the NOR. Notably, after hybridizing Au with Nb2O5−x, the current density of Au–Nb2O5−x significantly decreases compared to that of Nb2O5−x, indicating that the OER activity of Au–Nb2O5−x is suppressed. To further confirm the inhibition effect of Au NPs on the OER performance of Nb2O5−x, more electrochemical tests were carried out in Ar-saturated 1.0 M KOH solution. As shown in Fig. S24,† compared to Au–Nb2O5−x, Nb2O5−x exhibits a higher current density in LSV curves and a larger electrochemically active surface area (ESCA) under nitrogen-free conditions. However, Au–Nb2O5−x has better electrical conductivity, which can be attributed to the excellent conductivity of Au NPs. Thence, the electron transfer between Au and oxygen vacancies inhibits the OER activity on oxygen vacancies.
To gain more insights into the promotion mechanism, N2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) characterization was performed. As shown in Fig. 7a, both Nb2O5 and Au–Nb2O5 exhibit a distinct peak from about 350 °C to 670 °C, which may be due to the deoxidation of Nb2O5 under high temperature and oxygen-free conditions.24 Thermogravimetric analysis was carried out to confirm this supposition (Fig. S25†), which shows that the mass loss of Nb2O5 occurred from 150 °C to 800 °C. Therefore, the nitrogen adsorption capacity of Nb2O5 is weak, which is consistent with its poor NOR performance, whereas, the TPD signal of Au–Nb2O5 gets stronger than that of Nb2O5 in the range of about 400–600 °C, which indicates that the existence of Au NPs enhances the nitrogen adsorption capacity of Nb2O5 and promotes the NOR performance.24 As shown in Fig. 7b, the peak between 300 and 600 °C is attributed to chemical adsorption on oxygen vacancies in Nb2O5−x,46 indicating that oxygen vacancies can serve as nitrogen adsorption sites to facilitate NOR performance. After loading of Au NPs, the TPD signal of Au–Nb2O5−x is significantly higher than that of Nb2O5−x and the position of the adsorption peak shifts to higher temperature, which suggests that Au–Nb2O5−x possesses stronger N2 adsorption capacity, resulting in better NOR performance. Remarkably, the promotion of the N2 adsorption capacity of Au–Nb2O5−x is much higher than that of Au–Nb2O5, indicating that the electron transfer between Au and oxygen vacancies makes the promotion much higher.

Combining the results of XPS, EPR, N2-TPD and electrochemical tests, we suppose that the electron transfer from Au to Nb2O5−x plays a vital role in promoting electrocatalytic NOR performance. On one hand, oxygen vacancies in the Nb2O5−x nanobelts can serve as active sites for the NOR because of the strong adsorption to nitrogen, while the activity of the competitive OER is improved at the same time due to the existence of a single d-electron.47,48 On the other hand, Au NPs can also serve as N2 adsorption sites to facilitate NOR performance. However, due to the low content of Au NPs and the weak interaction between Au and Nb2O5, the promotion for NOR performance is limited. When it comes to the Au–Nb2O5−x hybrid, Au NPs tend to nucleate on the surface oxygen vacancies of Nb2O5−x and form the Au/Nb2O5−x interface because Au NPs possess an electron-enriched surface and the oxygen vacancies can serve as electron trapping centers.42,49,50 Due to the strong interaction between Au and oxygen vacancies, electrons near the Au/Nb2O5−x interface transfer from Au to Nb2O5−x and pair with the single electrons in the oxygen vacancies near the interface. This increases the coordination numbers and decreases the number of dangling bonds of Nb2O5−x, leading to the loss of active sites and the inhibition of OER activity.47,48 Meanwhile, the loading of Au NPs further promotes the nitrogen adsorption capacity of the surface of the Au–Nb2O5−x, which can also promote the NOR performance of the electrocatalyst. Consequently, the electron transfer between Au and oxygen vacancies adjusts the electronic structure of active sites near the Au/Nb2O5−x interface, which suppresses the activity of the competitive OER on oxygen vacancy sites and facilitates nitrogen adsorption on the surface of the electrocatalyst. Finally, the NOR performance of Au–Nb2O5−x gets significantly promoted.
Conclusions
In summary, oxygen vacancy-enriched Nb2O5−x nanobelts were prepared on Nb foil by an in situ synthesis method and annealing treatment, and then hybridized with Au NPs. The as-prepared Au–Nb2O5−x nanobelts can function as an efficient electrocatalyst for the NOR with a high nitrate yield rate of 2.29 μg h−1 cmcat.−2 and a faradaic efficiency of 9.8% in Na2SO4 electrolyte. XPS, EPR and N2-TPD characterization tests and well-designed electrochemical experiments reveal that electron transfer occurs at the interface of Au and Nb2O5−x, which adjusts the electronic structure of active sites near the interface. The activity of the competitive OER on oxygen vacancy sites is suppressed and nitrogen adsorption on the surface of Au–Nb2O5−x is facilitated, which lead to the great enhancement in NOR performance. Overall, this work is expected to offer a new insight for designing efficient NOR electrocatalysts.
