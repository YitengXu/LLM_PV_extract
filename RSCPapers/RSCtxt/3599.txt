    , Accepted 17th July 2014First published on 17th July 2014AbstractA new approach has been employed to grow large size and high number density rutile TiO2 nanorods (NRs) by low cost chemical methods. Nuclei layers of low (~30 nm) and high (~150 nm) thickness have been optimized on glass substrates for growing NRs using spin coating and chemical spray pyrolysis methods respectively. The scanning electron and atomic force microscopic images clearly show that randomly aligned, large size, exotic NRs have grown on low thickness seed layers at a high temperature (180 °C), and that interconnected, NRs with good number density have grown on high thickness seed layers at a low temperature (120 °C) via hydrothermal synthesis. The structural studies clearly reveal that the as-grown NRs have tetragonal rutile structures with different anisotropic crystallographic plane growth along the c-axis. The preferentially oriented (110) Bragg reflection in the large size NRs and (101) Bragg reflection in the number dense NRs illustrate that the Ti atoms are positioned in the middle of the atomic layer and stimulate randomly standing NRs along the direction of stacking. The growth orientation and single crystalline nature of the NRs are confirmed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy and μ-Raman scattering. The absorbance value and the shift in the UV-vis energy region of the TiO2 NRs are strongly dependent on the number density and/or size of the NRs. The crystal defects of the prepared rutile TiO2 NRs are analyzed using photoluminescence spectra. Our results show that the thickness of the seed layer and the growth temperature play a pivotal role in determining the two anisotropic crystallographic plane growths of rutile TiO2 NRs.
1. Introduction
TiO2 is a high energy band-gap (~3.2 eV, 2p levels of O2− valence band to 3d levels of Ti4+ conduction band) semiconductor and has been widely investigated for its use in both energy and environmental applications such as self-cleaning materials, photocatalysts and photoelectrodes in liquid junction solar cells owing to its strong oxidizing capacity, nontoxicity, and long-term photostability.1–8 In particular, TiO2 nanomaterials demonstrate high performance levels for these applications compared to their bulk form due to their higher surface to volume ratio. In particular, one dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanostructures such as nanorods (NRs), nanowires (NWs), and nanotubes (NTs) have accelerated research on nanoscale materials because of their well-defined crystalline structure, unique optical properties and quantum confinement effect. These excellent properties provide ideal electron transport during cell performance, which minimizes the charge recombination process.9–14
Nanostructures of TiO2 can exist in three crystal structures; two tetragonal forms (anatase, rutile) and one rhombic form (brookite). Among them, the (110) surface of rutile TiO2 has been shown to be highly active for photocatalytic water splitting and numerous other applications in photochemistry and catalysis.15,16 The rutile form of the NRs is mainly surrounded by the (110) crystallographic plane and that is the most thermodynamically stable surface at ambient conditions. Therefore, growing this particular surface orientation of rutile TiO2 film is important. Furthermore, the size and shape of the NRs mainly depends on the synthetic conditions.
Several techniques such as sputtering,17 MOCVD,18 aerosol pyrolysis,19 electro deposition,20 sol–gel methods,21,22 spray pyrolysis23 and hydrothermal methods24,25 have been adopted for the preparation of nanostructured TiO2 thin films. Among these diverse conventional techniques, hydrothermal synthesis is a simple and cost effective method for growing well-aligned nanostructures with high specific surface areas, and the single-crystalline material is easily obtained.26,27 Also, the particle size, morphology and structure are mainly dependent on the preparation parameters such as pH, temperature and so on. On the other hand, well-known chemical routes such as spin coating, chemical spray pyrolysis and dip coating, and physical methods such as electron beam evaporation have been employed for seed layer preparation.22,23,28 Among them, spin coating and chemical spray pyrolysis techniques are promising techniques to deposit uniform coatings of materials on high-aspect ratio structures with low thicknesses. Another benefit of these methods is their low cost because they do not require any expensive equipment.
The aspect ratio and length of the NRs are very important from the applications perspective. The reason is that the surface to volume ratio of the NRs is dependent on their aspect ratio. Hence, it is expected that the aspect ratio of the NRs might be one of the most promising factors in deciding the carrier transport in electronic devices. Furthermore, increasing the length of the NRs leads to the formation of single-crystalline materials and also enhances the electron transport. The aspect ratio and length of the NRs can be easily controlled by the synthetic conditions such as the growth temperature, precursor concentration, pH of the solution and growth time. C. Wang et al. have investigated how the crystal size and shape of TiO2 NRs could be adjusted by varying the solution conditions. The diameter and density of the NRs are directly proportional to the precursor concentration. Furthermore, the diameters of the NRs increased dramatically with respect to a change in the volume of the DD water and HCl used. Finally, it was concluded that optimising the length and diameter with constant spacing of the NRs of the working electrode gives the maximum power conversion efficiency in quantum dot sensitized solar cells.26 H. Wang et al. have reported the hydrothermal synthesis of single-crystalline NRs on a conductive substrate (fluorine-doped tin oxide, FTO) for application in quantum dot sensitized solar cells. The NRs are nearly perpendicular to the FTO substrate with respect to the preferentially oriented (002) crystallographic plane. The length of the NRs is up to 3 μm. The shrinkage of the NRs along the growth direction in acidic media leads to the formation of single-crystalline materials.27 A. Wolcott et al. have fabricated dense and aligned NR arrays using oblique-angle deposition on a FTO substrate. The number density of the NRs is in the order of 25 × 106 mm−2, and the materials are expected to be useful for application in photoelectrochemical cells.29 J. T. Park et al. have grown vertically aligned TiO2 NRs with a high density on spin coated seed layer covered FTO glass. The NRs are homogeneously distributed on the substrate with lengths of 3 μm and diameters of 70 nm.30
From surveying the above articles, we realized that the quality of the NRs is very important for device applications. Hence, here, we report the preparation of a TiO2 nuclei layer on a bare glass substrate using two deposition techniques, spin coating and chemical spray pyrolysis. The TiO2 seed layer coated glass substrates were subjected to heat treatment (annealing) at 450 °C for 4 h to improve their crystallinity. Further to this, hydrothermal synthesis was used to grow TiO2 NRs on the seed layer coated glass substrates. Extensive investigations have been carried out to understand the growth of the NRs and the phase transformation of the TiO2 nanostructures on the seed layer coated glass substrates.31–35
For the first time we have optimized the minimum and maximum thicknesses of seed layers on glass substrates by two chemical deposition methods for growing 1D rutile TiO2 NRs at two different growth temperatures (180 and 120 °C). The NRs are randomly grown along the c-axis with two different preferentially oriented crystallographic planes, which stimulates the growth of the long, number dense NRs. This approach is new and has not been previously described in the literature.
2. Experimental section
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) 95% was used as a source material for titanium (Ti) and was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ethanol, double distilled (DD) water and acetic acid were used as solvents and a stabilizing agent respectively. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) served as an acidic catalyst to control the hydrolysis rate of the titanium source. The ethanol, acetic acid and HCl were obtained from Merck and used as received. Microscopic glass slides of the dimensions 37.5 mm × 12.5 mm × 1 mm were used as substrates. The substrates were washed using soap solution and subsequently kept in hot chromic acid at 70 °C for 30 minutes and then cleaned in double distilled water and acetone separately in an ultrasonic bath.
The first TiO2 seed layer was prepared by a sol–gel spin coating method. The appropriate amount of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP), 18 ml of ethanol, and 0.2 ml of acetic acid were mixed together and stirred for about 2 h at room temperature to obtain the final sol–gel solution. The prepared sol–gel solution was dropped onto the well-cleaned glass substrate. It was rotated at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s resulting in the formation of a thin layer film. A number of samples was prepared with different preparatory parameters. The films were baked at 100 °C for 10 min and then allowed to reach ambient temperature. Subsequently, the baked films were annealed at 450 °C in a muffle furnace at a constant heating rate under an air atmosphere for about 4 h.
Another TiO2 seed layer was deposited on a bare glass substrate by a chemical spray pyrolysis technique. TTIP was added drop by drop into ethanol with continuous gentle stirring. The resultant transparent precursor solution was obtained after 30 min. The resultant final solution was sprayed through the nozzle onto the preheated glass substrate at 200 °C with the help of an air compressor. The spray pyrolysis parameters such as substrate temperature and precursor concentration were varied to prepare more than five samples, and the other parameters such as the spray angle, spray time and spray interval were kept constant. The prepared TiO2 seed layer films were annealed at 450 °C for 4 h.
The TiO2 NRs were grown on the seed layer coated glass substrates using a hydrothermal method. The appropriate amount of HCl (35%) was mixed with double distilled water and stirred for 10 min. 0.2 ml of TTIP solution was added drop by drop to the above solution. The final precursor solution was transferred into a Teflon lined stainless steel (50 ml capacity) autoclave. The TiO2 NRs were grown on the seed layer coated substrate inclined at 45° to the walls of the Teflon with its face up. The hydrothermal process was carried out at 120 °C for 16 h on the spray coated seed layers and 180 °C for 4 h on the spin coated seed layers. Furthermore, some of the spray pyrolysis coated nuclei layer films were introduced to the NR growth solution at a temperature of 120–180 °C within the growth time of 4–16 h. After the hydrothermal synthesis, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The substrate was taken out from the solution and dried at room temperature. Before characterization, we named the spin and spray pyrolysis coated nuclei layer a and b respectively, and the TiO2 NRs grown on the corresponding seed layers are denoted as a1 and b1.
The crystalline phase and growth direction of the a1 and b1 NRs were determined using a Brucker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) [2θ = 10–80°, CuKα = 1.540 Å]. The single crystalline nature of the NRs was confirmed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (PHILIPS, model-CM200, operated at a 200 kV accelerating voltage). The surface morphology of the a1 and b1 NRs was analyzed using a JEOL (JSM-5610LV) scanning electron microscope (SEM). The surface topography and the root mean squared (RMS) surface roughness of the a, b, a1 and b1 samples were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Non-contact mode, A100 SGS, APE Research). The optical absorption spectra of the a, b, a1 and b1 samples were recorded in the wavelength range of 190–900 nm using a Shimadzu-UV 2450 double beam spectrophotometer at room temperature. The photoluminescence spectra of the TiO2 NRs were analyzed using a RF-5301 spectrofluorometer in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. The vibrational properties of the TiO2 NRs were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (BRUKER Optik) in the wave number range of 400–4000 cm−1. A spot size of ~1 μm of the a1 and b1 NRs were excited using a 632.8 nm He–Ne laser line from a LabRam HR800 micro-Raman instrument, and its backscattering mode was recorded in the wave number range of 100–800 cm−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural and morphological studies of TiO2 NRs

Fig. 1 depicts the X-ray diffraction pattern of the a1 (2θ = 10–80°) and b1 (2θ = 15–75°) NRs. The XRD of the as-grown NRs on the spin coated seed layer consists of diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 27.4°, 36.1°, 39.1°, 41.2°, 44.0°, 54.3°, 56.6°, 63.0° and 69.8° due to the (110), (101), (200), (111), (210), (211), (220), (002) and (112) Bragg reflections respectively. All of the diffraction peaks of the NRs correspond to those of a pure crystalline tetragonal rutile phase (JCPDS no 76-0317, a = 4.592, b = 2.957). Some of the Bragg peaks in the X-ray pattern indicate a strong orientation along a specific direction. The relatively intense diffraction peak at 2θ = 27.4° corresponding to the (110) plane indicates a preferential orientation growth along the c-axis. The narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the tall (110) diffraction peak (~0.142) demonstrates that the NRs are of a strong rutile phase with good crystalline quality. The {001} facets exposed rutile structure of the individual TiO2 NRs are comprised of repeating (110) crystallographic plane side surfaces along the direction of stacking. No characteristic peaks were observed for other polymorphs which indicates the high purity and single phase crystallinity of the rutile TiO2 NRs. The size of the a1 crystals was estimated using the Scherrer formula and was found to be ~52 nm. The TiO2 NRs grown on the chemical spray pyrolysis coated seed layer have diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 27.4°, 36.1°, 41.2°, 54.3° and 63.0° due to the (110), (101), (111), (211) and (002) diffraction planes of the tetragonal rutile structure (JCPDS 76-0317). One extra peak observed at 25.4° is due to the (101) plane corresponding to an anatase phase (JCPDS 86-1285). The XRD of the as-grown NRs on the spray pyrolysis coated nuclei layer corresponds well with a previous literature report, in which dense rutile NRs were grown on an anatase seed layer with the help of the (101) crystallographic direction.28 The XRD pattern of the b1 sample shows a predominant Bragg reflection at 36.10° with a FWHM of 0.176, which is an indication of a smaller crystallite size. The half-width of the (110) Bragg reflection is sharper than the (101) Bragg reflection, which indicates that the film grows anisotropically. The contact angle between the (101) and (002) crystallographic planes is ~33°. Hence, here some of the NRs are perpendicular to the substrate surface, while other NRs lean towards the azimuthal direction. The presence of the anatase Bragg reflection reveals that the edge-shared bonding formed on the anatase nuclei particles at the initial stage of the hydrothermal reaction, owing to lattice mismatch with respect to a lower growth rate. Therefore, the preferentially oriented crystallographic plane growth of 1D TiO2 nanostructures can be affected by the physical, chemical, and electrical properties. Furthermore, the mechanical strength of the material is also affected.

In a theoretical prediction, the four types of two dimensional titania slabs – (110), (100), (101) and (001) – generated one-dimensional rutile TiO2 nanostructures36 because the growth rate of these different crystal faces depends on the numbers of corners and edges of the coordination polyhedra available. Compared with other polymorphs, the rutile TiO2 polymorph has a higher surface energy. However, experimentally the Ti–HCl ratios in solution determine the particular phase growth of TiO2 nanostructure. The fixed precursor concentration leads to the formation of rutile crystallites on the anatase seed layer substrate. In our case, the rutile TiO2 NRs are grown on nuclei layers of different thicknesses by a hydrothermal reaction at low (120 °C) and high (180 °C) temperatures. Hence, a different growth rate is expected in this work. At the higher solution temperature, the (110) crystallographic plane could be exposed on the low thickness seed layer at a higher growth rate owing to its higher surface energy. Here, the atoms are exposed to form the (110) crystallographic plane at a higher temperature by a quadruply-coordinated Ti atom and the doubly-coordinated oxygens of the first layer, as well as the fully coordinated oxygen of the second layer. This is the main reason that the (110) crystallographic plane growth of rutile TiO2 has the most stable surface. On the other hand, the reaction system energy is directly proportional to the temperature of the autoclave. Therefore, the system energy decreases when the growth temperature is lowered. At the lower growth temperature, the (101) preferentially oriented crystallographic direction is induced on the high thickness seed layer at a lower growth rate. Both five- and six-coordinate Ti atoms as well as doubly and triply-coordinated oxygens are stimulated to form the (101) crystallographic plane growth of rutile TiO2 NRs at the lower growth temperature. The preferentially oriented crystallographic (110) plane in the a1 and (101) plane in the b1 NRs are parallel to the NRs growth direction (inset – XRD). This result reveals that the rutile NRs are standing randomly along the c-axis. The careful selection of the initial nucleation by choosing the nuclei layer thickness, and the control of the Ti growth ratio by controlling the growth temperature are determining the preferentially oriented crystallographic plane growth of the rutile TiO2 NRs. Hence, we conclude that the seed layer thickness and growth temperature both influence the internal factor of the energetically favorable surface, thus leading to the formation of (110) and (101) crystallographic planes.
The crystallinity and growth direction of the a1 and b1 NRs were then confirmed by TEM, HRTEM and SAED characterization. Fig. 2(i–iii) and (iv–vi) show TEM, HRTEM and SAED patterns of the a1 and b1 NRs respectively. The a1 NR lattice fringes have an interplanar spacing parallel to the side wall of ~0.311 nm, which is in accordance with the (110) crystallographic planes of the tetragonal rutile TiO2 structure. The TEM image of the b1 sample clearly reveals that a group of small NR pillars agglomerate to form NRs. The lattice fringes have an interplanar spacing perpendicular to the side wall of ~0.290 nm, which is in accordance with the {001} facets, which is quite apparent from the HRTEM fringes. The SAED patterns of both of the NRs provide more evidence for the c-axis oriented growth and the single crystalline nature of the rutile TiO2 NRs. This result provides a strong confirmation of the tetragonal rutile structure of the TiO2 NRs and is consistent with the XRD results.

The SEM images of the as-grown TiO2 NRs denoted as a1 and b1 are shown in Fig. 3. Two thicknesses of seed layers were prepared using two chemical methods (spin coating and chemical spray pyrolysis) for the NR growth. During the hydrothermal reaction, the orientation, size and shape of the NRs mainly depends on the growth time, growth temperature, substrate, reactant concentration and acidity. But, here, the growth of the two different preferentially oriented crystallographic planes of rutile NRs depends on the thickness of the nuclei layer at different growth temperatures. The NRs are found to be homogeneously distributed over the whole substrates, which indicates that the preparation method is very important to deposit over a large area at low-cost. The evolution of the various preferentially oriented crystallographic planes of 1D NRs on different thickness nuclei layers at two different growth temperatures is discussed.

It is well known that the growth rate is strongly dependent on the growth temperature within the autoclave. The growth rate is fast at the higher growth temperature and thus leads to the formation of longer rutile TiO2 NRs with respect to the (110) preferentially oriented diffraction plane. The length and diameter of these NRs is ~1.5 μm and 600 nm respectively, and they are shown in Fig. 3(a1). The diameter of the NRs shrinks with the growth along the c-axis. The reason is that the rapid growth of the (001) crystallographic plane under a coarsening mechanism significantly reduces the surface energy, especially in acidic media. The density of the NRs is calculated to be approximately 3 × 104 cm−2. Fig. 3(b1) exhibits the SEM images of as-grown rutile TiO2 NRs on the chemical spray pyrolysis coated seed layer. At the lower solution temperature, the growth rate is slow in the system which stimulates the formation of randomly aligned NRs with a high number density, with the help of the (101) crystallographic plane on the high thickness nuclei layer. For the clear identification of the number dense NRs, 1 μm and 500 nm scale bar SEM images are used. The average diameter and length of the NRs are 150 and 600 nm respectively. From the low magnification SEM image, the flower like NRs are observed randomly on the nuclei layer owing to the large size of the nuclei that would be present in some regions of the high thickness seed layer. The number density of these NRs was found to be approximately 2.4 × 105 cm−2. Therefore, NRs with a high number density are observed at the lower growth temperature (120 °C) and larger size NRs with a lower number density are seen at the higher temperature of 180 °C. Generally, the low growth rate induces number dense NRs due to collisions between ions in the medium at the lower temperature. The solution pressure determines the collisions between ions and is directly proportional to the temperature of the solution in the hydrothermal process. In our study, we have found that the number density and large size of the TiO2 NRs could be controlled by varying the solution temperature as well as the seed layer thickness. The number dense NRs can offer a larger surface area for dye adsorption, and large size NRs give the opportunity for greater sensitizing quantum dots. The interpenetration of dye molecules or QDs with a 1D metal oxide working electrode in a liquid junction solar cell is a key factor for photocurrent generation, and it is critically dependent on the size and/or number density of NRs.26 The aspect ratio α (α = length/width) of the (110) and (101) preferentially oriented a1 and b1 NRs is found to be approximately the same with the square top. Fig. 3(a2 and b2) illustrate the square top diameter distribution of the a1 and b1 NRs, which demonstrates that the TiO2 NRs are in the form of a tetragonal crystal structure. Extensive investigation revealed that the rutile NRs were made up from the agglomeration of a small number of NRs. Here, we report well defined tetragonal shaped rutile NRs without the coalescence of small NR pillars, particularly in the a1 sample, which is beneficial for the effective flow of electrons in optoelectronic devices. The size of the nuclei particles depends on the thickness of the seed substrate, which determines the diameter of the growing TiO2 NRs. This is because the size of the nuclei confines the diameter and promotes the formation of randomly aligned NRs along the c-axis. Furthermore, during the initial NR growth, the diameter of the nuclei is restricted by the neighboring nuclei nanoparticles. Ti and O atomic layers are stacked alternatively, which decides the number density and the length of the NRs growing under the preferentially oriented crystallographic plane with respect to the growth rate and the size of the nuclei. Hence, the present work has opened a new experimental procedure for producing high and low number density long rutile TiO2 NRs.
An energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis, collected during the SEM analysis, offers information about the elemental composition. The EDX spectrum was recorded with an accelerating voltage and a working distance of 10 kV and 8 nm respectively. Fig. 4 shows the EDX spectrum of the top portion of a single a1 NR sample. Here, we have recorded the EDX spectrum from the magnified top view and hence carbon and copper signals come from the double-sided carbon tape and copper stub, respectively. Some of the NRs are randomly standing on the seed layer glass substrate, therefore, the stoichiometry of the Ti and O are probed at three points (~bottom, middle and top) along the axial direction by selecting the option ‘point & id’ from the top view. The oxygen peak at 0.5 keV (O Kα) indicates that the O is dominant and the Ti peaks at 4.5 keV (Ti Kα) and 4.9 keV (Ti kβ) are observed in signals coming from the bottom, middle and top portions of the single nanorod. The TiO2 NRs grown on the spin coated seed layer have Ti and O ratios in the bottom, middle and top portion of the NRs of 30.78:60.22, 30.94:60.06 and 30.13:60.87 at.% respectively. For the TiO2 NRs grown on the spray pyrolysis coated seed layer these ratios are 30.62:60.38, 30.69:60.31 and 30.00:60.00 at.% respectively. The EDX analyses clearly revealed that the main bodies of the 1D TiO2 NRs consist of Ti and O. This result is in good agreement with the literature value.31 A photograph of the uniform and well coated TiO2 NR films is shown in the inset of the a1 EDX spectrum (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  EDX spectrum of the a1 sample. 
2D AFM images of the a and b seed layers and 2D and 3D AFM images of the a1 and b1 NRs are shown in Fig. 5. After a few attempts and careful selection of the spot area, we have taken AFM images for the a1 and b1 NRs. The images of the a and b seed layers reiterate that the high density nuclei nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the bare glass substrates, and some voids are also observed in the samples. This nucleation center supports the subsequent growth of NRs due to the lower interfacial energy between the crystal nuclei and the substrate. The thicknesses of the seed layers and the height of the NRs were measured using a stylus profilometer and the height profile of the AFM. The height of the NRs is ~1.5 μm and 600 nm for a1 and b1 NRs respectively. 2D and 3D AFM images of the a1 sample show that the NRs are randomly distributed and not interconnected, and hence we suggest that long NRs with a low number density are formed on the low thickness seed layer. The densely packed NRs are observed in the 2D and 3D AFM images of the b1 sample. The NRs are well interconnected without coalescence, providing evidence for the formation of number dense NRs on the high thickness seed layer. The AFM images of the NRs are in good agreement with the SEM images.

3.2 Optical studies of TiO2 NRs
Semiconductors such as metal oxides and metal chalcogenides have both ionic and covalent bonds between atoms, which gives rise to an energy band gap in the materials. Recording the absorption spectrum for semiconductors directly determines the electronic structure of the material by exciting electrons from the valence band to the conduction band using ultraviolet and visible radiation. Hence, UV-vis photons were passed through the TiO2 seed layers and NRs and recorded in the wavelength range of 190–900 nm. The optical absorbance spectra of the TiO2 NRs and seed layer films in the range of 300–450 nm are shown in Fig. 6(i). From the figure it is clear that the strong response in the UV region can be attributed to band–band transitions, which is characteristic of wide band-gap TiO2 nanostructures. The redshift in absorption of the TiO2 NRs compared to the seed layer coated glass substrate is due to increasing the thickness/length of the NRs. It illustrates the better light trapping effect of the TiO2 NRs. Furthermore, compared with the b1, the absorbance of the a1 NRs is red shifted, which is due to the increase in crystallinity. The marginal change in the absorbance value of the TiO2 NRs may be attributed to the difference in the number of NRs on the seed layer coated glass substrates. The light trapping effect of the 1D TiO2 NRs is directly proportional to the number density of the NRs. Fundamentally, TiO2 possesses an indirect band-gap system and the band-gap energies of the NRs were calculated using the Tauc's plot Eg = (αhν)1/2/(hν) method (Fig. 6(ii)), where hν, α and Eg are the photon energy, absorption coefficient and band-gap of the inter-band transition respectively. The observed linear behavior in this energy region corresponds to a strong absorption near the absorption edge. Extrapolating the straight line from the linear portion of the curve to the zero absorption edge gives the band-gap of the NRs. In addition, the energy gaps for the rutile and anatase TiO2 nanostructures are 3.0 and 3.3 eV respectively.28 The calculated band-gap values of the high density nanoparticles containing anatase seed layers and rutile NRs are in good agreement with the reported literature values, and the band-gap values of the seed layers and the rutile NRs are 3.21, 3.17 and 2.95, 3.01 eV respectively. The weak optical absorption in the a1 and b1 NRs above the absorption edge wavelength region results from the sub-band transitions closely related to the surface oxygen vacancies (SOVs).

The crystallization quality and defect structures (charge carrier trapping, migration and transfer, and electron–hole pairs) of semiconductor materials can be observed in the photoluminescence spectrum (PL). The as-grown TiO2 NRs were excited with a wavelength of 325 nm and the corresponding recorded emission spectrum in the wavelength range of 340–550 nm is shown in Fig. 7(i). Generally, two emission bands are observed for TiO2 nanostructures at room temperature. These emissions are classified as near band edge emission (NBE) and deep level emission (DLE). The NBE is due to the radiative recombination of electrons from the conduction band to the valence band (band-to-band transition, O2p to Ti3d). The stronger deep level emission in the visible region mainly originates from defect states such as Ti interstitials and oxygen vacancies. In the as-grown TiO2 NRs, the emission spectra show relatively broad visible emissions but weak and intense NBEs in the near UV region with FWHMs of ~5 and 6 nm for the a1 and b1 NRs respectively. The visible emissions from the a1 and b1 NRs can be attributed to the charge transfer transition from trapped electrons in (1) an oxygen vacancy, (2) Ti vacancies and (3) surface oxygen vacancies (SOVs). Generally in metal oxides, metal and oxygen vacancies and SOVs create deep levels below the bottom of the conduction band. The charge state of the vacancies can drop one or two electrons to the valence band and the depletion region, which can induce considerable variation in the band gap.37 The emission around 415 and 483 nm is related to the SOVs, which is in good agreement with the absorption spectrum. Another emission peak at 451 nm is mainly attributed to the Ti3+ vacancies. The 3D AFM images of the a1 and b1 NRs clearly show that the space between the randomly aligned, long NRs is high, compared with the number dense NRs, and this is the reason for the lower recombination rate in the b1 sample. Therefore, the photo-excited emission generates a wide spectrum in the wavelength range of 400 to 550 nm, when the excitation photon travels through the gap between the randomly aligned NRs and interacts with the seed substrate. Hence, the SOVs are observed from the PL spectrum of the a1 and b1 NRs. The NBE and DLE peak intensities of the NRs depend on the gap between the NRs and the number density of the NRs. The optical quality of the TiO2 NRs was confirmed from the near band edge emission peaks at 381 and 383 nm for the a1 and b1 NRs respectively, and the presence of stable SOVs was also confirmed by the NRs excited with different wavelength photons.

Fig. 7(ii) shows the FTIR transmittance spectrum of the a1 and b1 NRs in the wavenumber range of 400–700 cm−1. The TiO2 NRs grown on the spin coated seed layer gave transmittance peaks at 523 cm−1, 504 cm−1, 480 cm−1, 448 cm−1 and 418 cm−1, which are assigned to the Ti–O–Ti stretching vibrations in the rutile phase. The transmittance peaks of the TiO2 NRs grown on the spray coated seed layer are found at 542 cm−1, 474 cm−1 and 428 cm−1, which are assigned to the Ti–O–Ti stretching vibration in the tetragonal phases (rutile and anatase). No impurity peaks are detected in the TiO2 NRs.
μ-Raman measurements are often used for the investigation of the various phases of TiO2 nanostructures. This technique is capable of elucidating the structural complexity of TiO2 in which the individual phases (rutile or anatase) are easily distinguishable. The rutile TiO2 phase has a tetragonal structure and exhibits symmetry characteristic of the space group P42/mnm. Each lattice contains 10 optical phonons of symmetries, as there are 2 molecules per unit cell, expressed as A1g + A2g + A2u + B1g + B2g + Eg + 2B1u + 3Eu and are classified into three modes of vibration (Raman-active, IR-active and inactive in both Raman and IR spectra). The (110) and (101) crystallographic plane growth of tetragonal rutile nanostructures have two TiO2 units (=O–Ti2O2–O = for (110) and = O2–Ti2–O2 = for (101)) per cell and have four Raman active modes. Experimentally, the Raman peaks appear at 235, 443, and 610 cm−1, which are assigned to the B1g, Eg, and A1g modes of rutile TiO2 respectively,38 and clear Raman bands appear at 244, 323, 442 and 607 cm−1 which are characteristic vibrations of rutile TiO2.39 The strong Raman peaks at 450 and 610 cm−1 for rutile TiO2 nanocrystalline film were reported by Ma et al.34 The oxygen vibrational mode (Eg) and the vibrational mode of the Ti–O bond (A1g) in rutile TiO2 NRs show a slight red-shift in the peak position and a broader line width compared to bulk crystals, which are attributed to both phonon confinement and residual stress.40,41
From reviewing the above Raman measurements, we realized that μ-Raman scattering would be a powerful technique to analyze the TiO2 material quality, phase orientation and single crystalline nature. Our as-grown NRs (denoted as a1 and b1 NRs) were subjected to μ-Raman scattering at room temperature. The recorded representative Raman spectra are shown in Fig. 8. The Raman peaks observed at 143, 237, 446 and 610 cm−1 on the spin coated nuclei and 244, 323, 442, and 607 cm−1 on the spray pyrolysis coated nuclei are closely matched with the reference values, indicating that the as-grown TiO2 NRs are in rutile form. The Raman band at 144 cm−1 in the TiO2 NRs grown on the spray pyrolysis coated nuclei layer is evidence for the presence of an anatase phase. This result is consistent with the XRD result. The Raman band at 246 cm−1 is due to the second order scattering by compound vibration, which is also considered as a characteristic vibration of rutile. It has been reported that the thin film thickness determines the FWHM value of Raman modes in rutile TiO2 nanostructures.42 In our case, the as-grown, single-phase TiO2 NRs have a large size and number density, thus leading to different surface to volume ratios of the NRs. The FWHM of the Eg mode is calculated to be 41.99 and 47.13 cm−1 for the a1 and b1 NRs respectively. Moreover, the FWHM of the A1g mode corresponding to the Raman band at 610 cm−1 is calculated to be 40.20 and 53.43 cm−1 for the a1 and b1 NRs, respectively, indicating an increase in FWHM. The decrease of FWHM in the a1 sample indicates that the crystallinity is enhanced when the NRs are grown at a higher temperature. These values are in good agreement with the results of the XRD and the SEM images. From the Eg and A1g Raman modes, the Raman peaks of the number dense NRs become broader, because the small size of the NRs in the b1 sample gives a higher degree of structural disorder. Furthermore, the rutile TiO2 single crystal is also confirmed by the two prominent Eg and A1g Raman bands.

4. Discussion and growth mechanism
The mechanism for the two observed preferentially oriented plane growths of the rutile TiO2 NRs on the anatase high density nanoparticle nuclei layer can be explained by considering the results of the present study with a literature survey.
1D nanostructured metal oxides have charge carrier transport properties many times faster than those of nanoparticles owing to their higher diffusion coefficient. Therefore, in order to develop TiO2 based nanoscale functional devices, the control and quality of 1D nanostructures are essential. While developing 1D nanotechnology, the 1D TiO2 nanostructures have mainly been synthesized by researchers via physical deposition techniques including sputtering and chemical vapor deposition, where the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) and vapor–solid (VS) transformations occurs at higher temperature. The resulting nanostructures are sensitive and depend on the preparatory conditions.43 Mass production using physical methods are expensive. For this reason, wet-chemical methods are attractive for nanotechnologists, and this method is user-friendly and more suitable for inexpensive mass production. B. Liu et al. grew, for the first time, single-crystalline rutile 1D TiO2 NRs directly on a FTO substrate using a hydrothermal method and the size and number density of the TiO2 NRs could be varied by changing the solution parameters.31 This report has opened a new door for producing 1D nanostructures on conductive substrates at a low cost for making devices. The nuclei layer including ITO and FTO substrates are used for the growth of 1D nanostructures, because thus far bare glass substrates have been unsuccessful for this purpose. The reason is that the lattice mismatch between nuclei particles and rutile TiO2 is mainly considered during the growth of 1D nanostructures. Furthermore it was noticed that the resistivity value of the FTO substrate determines the 1D nanostructure.44 Finally, we have found that the role of the thickness of the seed layer on the formation of the 1D TiO2 NRs is not seen in the literature. It is a challenge to grow oriented anisotropic single-crystalline 1D nanostructures on seed particle layer coated bare glass substrates. The seed layer thickness is a pivotal factor because it provides a nucleation force and residual strain during the growth of the NRs. Therefore, after a few months of surveying the literature, we planned to work on 1D TiO2 NRs. Firstly, we have deposited more than ten seed samples with various thicknesses using chemical spray pyrolysis and spin coating to optimize the growth conditions for growing 1D NRs. The minimum and maximum thickness of the nuclei layer have been optimized by spin coating and chemical spray pyrolysis techniques respectively. TiO2 seed layers of approximately 30 nm (prepared by spin coating) and 150 nm (prepared using spray pyrolysis) are the optimum thicknesses for growing TiO2 NRs. These two chemical deposition methods used to prepare the seed layers are low-cost methods that may be of interest to industrial researchers.
Hydrothermal synthesis under acidic conditions can be used to produce rutile nanocrystallites on anatase seed nanoparticles. Hence, in the present work, the uniform release of Ti from the chloride ligands leads to the formation of a rutile phase. Furthermore, the Cl:Ti ratio in the Ti–HCl solution determines the crystalline phase. The nucleation and growth of NRs is a very sensitive and complex process. Therefore, in order to understand the growth conditions of NRs on seed layer substrates, seed layers of different thicknesses have been used to grown NRs at different temperatures. TiO2 NRs did not grow on the seed layer coated glass substrate when the temperature was less than 100 °C, which is in good agreement with the rutile TiO2 NRs grown on FTO substrates previously reported.31 The uniform low thickness (~30 nm) of the seed layer was optimized by spin coating. When decreasing the thickness of the seed layer by means of decreasing the molar concentration in the solution as well as altering the RPM (rotation per minute) in the spin coating, we did not obtain any NR growth. Furthermore, it was found that the NRs formed at growth temperatures between 120–180 °C begin to peel off from the substrate when the thickness of the chemical spray pyrolysis coated nuclei layer was greater than 150 nm. The peeling of the film could be attributed to the competition between crystal growth and dissolution. The crystal dissolution on high-energy surfaces such as seed–nanorod surfaces depends on the reaction time and the supersaturation of the Ti salt. At a constant Ti concentration, the growth temperature (120–180 °C) and nuclei layer thickness produce strain in the interface between nuclei and NRs due to a lattice mismatch between them. For this reason, at equilibrium the rest of the NRs are dissolved in the reactant solution. The nuclei layer retains reflecting colors after the TiO2 NRs have lifted off from the nuclei layer coated glass substrate, which indicates that the film is peeling off at the seed–nanorod interface.
Generally, four-facets of TiO2 1D nanostructure are generated from 2D nanostructures, therefore it is possible to investigate different crystallographic plane growth of rutile TiO2 NRs by using a low thickness seed layer (~30 nm) and subjecting the NRs to growth at higher temperatures, as well as using a high thickness seed layer to grow NRs at a lower temperature. This is because the thickness of the seed layer decides the lattice mismatch with rutile TiO2 and generates different crystallographic plane growth with respect to the growth temperature. According to our structural analysis, we propose the two anisotropic crystallographic planes growth of rutile TiO2 NRs proceeds along the c-axis. Compared with other surfaces, the (110) face containing Ti and O atomic layer has the most stable surface because the growth of the rutile TiO2 NRs follows the sequence (110) < (100) < (101) < (001).45,46 Therefore, at a solution temperature of 180 °C, the fast growth rate induces the formation of the (110) crystallographic plane on low thickness seed layers due to its surface energy, where each Ti atom is coordinated to the six neighboring O atoms via two apical and four equatorial bonds, resulting in the randomly oriented long rutile TiO2 NRs. On the other hand, the growth temperature of 120 °C induces the formation of the (101) crystallographic plane, thus promoting the number dense rutile TiO2 NRs on the high thickness seed layer. A schematic diagram of the growth direction of the TiO2 NRs is shown in Fig. 9. When controlling the growth temperature, the randomly aligned 1D TiO2 NRs grown on different thickness of seed layer substrates are highly reproducible under identical conditions.

The preferentially oriented crystallographic (110) and (101) planes of rutile TiO2 NRs consisting of three atomic planes are each repeated along the direction of stacking which is marginally inclined from the normal to the seed layer coated glass substrate.36 This implies that the dipole moment of the atomic planes along the growth direction is zero, resulting in the natural anisotropic growth tendency of TiO2 crystallites. The crystal growth orientation and morphology of the 1D nanocrystal can be controlled by basic organic chemistry. Our experimental results reveal that the tetragonal shape of the NRs with square top facets does not change via free solvent–surface interactions such as hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic and van der Waals interaction. Here, the nuclei size of the anatase seed layer can selectively determine the (110) and (101) crystallographic plane growth orientation by suppressing further growth of this plane under different growth temperatures, resulting in the number dense and long NRs. From this work, we conclude that the thickness of the seed layer and the growth temperature can play a crucial role in determining the growth rates of different crystal faces and thus provide a useful tool for obtaining TiO2 NRs with high number density and length. Large size and high number density 1D TiO2 NRs are needed for the application of nanostructure anodes in photoelectrochemical cells and in dye or quantum dot sensitized solar cells.
5. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully investigated the use of nuclei layers of low and high thickness on glass substrates, obtained by spin coating and chemical spray pyrolysis, for growing 1D TiO2 NRs. High quality TiO2 NRs were grown on the TiO2 seed layer coated glass substrates with random alignment by hydrothermal synthesis. The structural investigations reveal the two anisotropic crystallographic planes of tetragonal rutile TiO2 NRs along the c-axis. The preferentially oriented (110) and (101) crystallographic planes imply that the TiO2 NRs stand randomly on the seed layer coated glass substrate. The single crystalline nature and growth orientation of the TiO2 NRs were confirmed by the HRTEM and SAED patterns. Furthermore, the formation of single crystalline rutile TiO2 NRs was confirmed by micro-Raman measurements. The light scattering effect of the charge carrier of the TiO2 NRs was explained using UV-vis absorption spectra. The presence of voids in the nuclei layer films was confirmed by AFM and they are present after the growth of the NRs. Hence, from the PL spectra, the excitation photons travel through the space between the randomly aligned TiO2 NRs and interact with seed substrate voids to generate SOVs.
