    , Accepted 8th December 2014First published on 9th December 2014AbstractSnO2 is an important alternative to TiO2 for use as a semiconductor in dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) photoanodes. In this work, we prepared SnO2 and Al-doped SnO2 nanocrystals via a simple hydrothermal method, and found for the first time that the tuning of the conduction band and suppression of charge recombination are simultaneously improved in the Al-doped samples. The electron lifetime is significantly improved and the conduction band edge is shifted negatively by doping the SnO2 photoanode with Al. Compared to the undoped SnO2 DSSCs (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2), the power conversion efficiency (η) of the optimized Al-doped SnO2 DSSCs is enhanced by 75%. After being treated with TiCl4, the highest η of DSSCs based on Al-doped SnO2 nanocrystals is approximately 6.91%, which is a high overall photoconversion efficiency for SnO2-based DSSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their low cost, simple fabrication process, and relatively high energy-conversion efficiency.1–4 In order to further improve the energy-conversion efficiency (η), and hence commercialize DSSCs, much effort has been focused on improving the photoanode, dye, electrolyte, and cathode, as well as their interfaces and fabrication technologies. The photoanode is made of a metal oxide semiconductor film with a wide band-gap and a mesoporous nanostructure for dye adsorption.5,6 Nanostructured TiO2 polycrystalline films typically have such characteristics and are usually used as the photoanode; an energy-conversion efficiency of 12.3% has been obtained by using TiO2 films as the electron-transporting electrode. However, the ultra-fast electron injection rates from the excited dye into the TiO2 nanoparticles are prevented by the high electron recombination rates due to low electron mobility (<1 cm2 V−1 s−1) and transport properties of the TiO2.7–9
Investigators continue to seek alternative materials, such as SnO2,10–15 ZnO,16,17 Nb2O5,18 SrTiO3,19,20 and Zn2SnO4,21 that may offer additional advantages in terms of device fabrication and cell performance. Of these materials, SnO2 is the most widely studied and suitable photoanode material for DSSCs due to its advantages, which include a wide band gap (Eg = 3.6 eV), chemical stability, and high electron mobility (125–250 cm2 V−1 s−1).22,23 In fact, a highly efficient DSSC with a power conversion efficiency of 6.80% based on hierarchical SnO2 octahedra has been reported.10 However, due to its high charge recombination and low dye adsorption performance, the energy-conversion efficiency for SnO2-based DSSCs is rather limited so far. Table 1 shows the reported values of η obtained in the DSSCs based on different SnO2 photoanode structures. (A more detailed summary of the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs based on different SnO2, SnO2/TiO2 composite, and SnO2/ZnO composite photoanode structures is presented in Table S1.†10,11,13,15,24–52) There is still much room for improvement of the performance of SnO2-based DSSCs that can be achieved by developing effective methods.

Doping metal atoms into semiconducting materials is a commonly adopted method to modify their properties, such as the electrical conductance, conductance band position, charge recombination rates, and trap/defect level distribution.53–55 Huang et al. prepared Nb-doped TiO2, and the Nb doping led to a significant increase of powder conductivity and a positive shift in the Vfb.53 Li et al. synthesized Mg-doped SnO2, and the designed structure both reduced recombination and prolonged the lifetime of DSSC devices.40 Teng et al. reported that the density of empty trap states for electron localization is smaller for the Zn-doped TiO2 films than for the bare-TiO2 film, due to increased band bending resulting from the elevated Fermi level.55
In this work, we for the first time prepared Al-doped SnO2 nanocrystals via a hydrothermal method and studied their performance for application as an electrode material in DSSCs. The Al doping was found to suppress the interfacial charge recombination process effectively and shift the conduction band edge negatively. As a result, the overall cell performance was improved by 75% for Al-doped SnO2-based DSSCs. Moreover, the performance of the Al–SnO2-based DSSCs was further improved after being treated with TiCl4, and the highest overall photo-conversion efficiency achieved was 6.91%. Finally, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the mechanism behind the improvement by Al doping is discussed in detail.
Experimental
Materials
SnCl4·5H2O (AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), Al(NO3)·9H2O (AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%, GC, Alfa), LiI (AR, Acros), I2 (AR, Acros), and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, AR, Aldrich) were obtained from commercial sources. All were used as received without further purification. 3-Hexyl-1-methylimidazolium iodide was prepared according to the literature.56cis-Ru(H2dcbpy)2(NCS)2(H2dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxy-2,2′-bipyridyl) (N3) was synthesized according to the literature.57 The electrode substrate used was fluorine-doped tin oxide conducting glass (FTO, Nippon Sheet Glass; thickness, 2.2 mm; sheet resistance, 14 Ω □−1).
Synthesis of SnO2 and Al-doped SnO2
SnO2 and Al-doped SnO2 nanocrystals were prepared using a simple hydrothermal method. Typically, SnCl4·5H2O (21.04 g) was dissolved in ethanol/distilled water (120 mL, v/v = 1/3). Then the solution was transferred into a 200 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept in an air-flow electric oven at 180 °C for 12 h. The resultant precipitates were centrifuged, washed with distilled water and absolute ethanol, and dried at 80 °C overnight. For preparation of the Al-doped samples, Al(NO3)·9H2O and SnCl4·5H2O were added to ethanol/distilled water (molar ratios of Al and Sn were 0.5:99.5, 1:99, 2:98, 3:97) to start the hydrothermal process. The obtained samples were denoted as SnO2, Sn0.995Al0.005O2, Sn0.99Al0.01O2, Sn0.98Al0.02O2 and Sn0.97Al0.03O2.
Cell fabrication and photovoltaic Measurements
SnO2 and Al-doped SnO2 films (ca. 8 μm) were fabricated on the FTO substrates using a doctor-blade method and the electrodes were heated at 450 °C for 30 min. The TiCl4 surface was treated by dipping the photoanodes in a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min and then sintering at 500 °C. After the sintering, when the temperature had cooled to about 80 °C, the electrodes were immersed in a dye bath containing 0.5 mM N3 in ethanol for 24 h. The thickness of the film was measured using SEM. The dye-coated SnO2 photoanode was sandwiched between Pt-coated conducting glass plates as the counter electrode and the intervening space filled with an electrolyte (composition: 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M TBP, and 0.6 M HMII in MPN).
The photocurrent density–voltage (J−V) characteristics were tested using a Keithly 2611 Source Meter (Keithley Instruments, Inc.). The light source was an AM 1.5 solar simulator (91160A, Newport Co.). The incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si solar cell and the cell active area was 0.20 cm2.
Characterization
The crystal structures of the undoped and Al-doped SnO2 nanocrystals were investigated by using an X-ray diffraction spectrometer (XRD, Rigaku Co., D/MAX-2500) with the Cu Kα radiation source at 40 kV and 150 mA. The morphology and structure of the samples were observed using scanning electron microscopes (SEM, Hitachi, S-4800) and a field-emission transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) (ESCALab220i-XL, VG Scientific) at ∼3 × 10−9 mbar background pressure. The binding energies were calibrated using the C1s (284.8 eV) photoelectron peak.
A three-electrode cell system was used for Mott–Schottky measurements. SnO2 or Al-doped SnO2 single films without dyes (ca. 3 μm) were used as the electrode. The active area was 0.25 cm2. A Pt wire and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted under an illumination of 100 mW cm−2, using a perturbation of ±10 mV over the open-circuit potential by using a Solartron 1255B frequency analyzer and Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface system. Transport and recombination time constants were measured using intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). The DSSCs were probed with a diode that emitted green light (max = 520 nm). The light intensity of the LED light source was 42 W m−2 (UV-A light intensity meter, Photoelectric Instrument Factory of Beijing Normal University). The LED provided both the DC and AC components of the illumination.
Computational details
In order to model the SnO2 doped with Al, a 3 × 3 × 4 supercell based on the unit cell was constructed, allowing us to investigate different substitution degrees of Sn1−xAlxO2, with x ranging from x = 0 to 0.052. All calculations were performed using the plane-wave projector-augmented wave method58,59 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.60,61 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)62 form of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was chosen as the exchange–correlation potential. To obtain reliable optimized structures, the maximum residual force used was less than 0.01 eV Å−1 and energies converged to within 5 × 10−6 eV per atom, and the k-point mesh was set to 3 × 3 × 4. The k-point mesh was set to 5 × 5 × 8 to calculate electronic properties. An energy cut-off of 550 eV was used in all cases.
Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of Al-doped SnO2 calcined at 450 °C in air for 30 min are presented in Fig. 1(a). All of the undoped and the Al-doped SnO2 compounds formed a tetragonal rutile crystal structure (PDF no. 77-0448) and no other crystalline forms were detected. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1(a), the diffraction peaks were observed to shift to higher theta values with increasing Al3+ content because of the smaller effective radius of Al3+ (0.54 Å) compared to that of Sn4+(0.69 Å), in accordance with the Bragg equation 2dsinθ = λ. This shift toward the higher angle reveals a reduction of the lattice constant, which can be attributed to the substitution of Sn4+ by Al3+. In Fig. 1(b), the sizes of the SnO2 nanoparticles calculated by the Scherrer equation declined from 15.85 nm to 11.57 nm as the amount of Al3+ ions was increased from x = 0 to x = 0.03, which shows that the addition of Al can effectively inhibit SnO2 crystallites from further growing.

Fig. 2 presents the TEM images and cross-sectional SEM images for SnO2 and the Sn0.98Al0.02O2 nanoparticles, respectively. It can be clearly seen that the average diameter of SnO2 is ca. 16 nm, and that of the Al-doped SnO2 samples is ca. 12 nm, in good agreement with the average size calculated from XRD results. The HRTEM image shows lattice fringes with a regular spacing of 0.34 nm associated with the (110) planes of SnO2 and Sn0.97Al0.03O2. The well-resolved fringes indicate the high crystallinity of the SnO2 and Sn0.97Al0.03O2 nanocrystals, which was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). An amorphous layer was also observed in the HRTEM for Sn0.97Al0.03O2 samples. This layer could be the Al2O3, which is consistent with a decrease of crystallite size with increasing content of doped Al. Al3+ ions can be added in the hydrothermal method to control the size of SnO2 nanoparticles by forming Al–O–Ti bonds and an amorphous layer, which block the growth sites on the surface of SnO2 nanoparticles. As the amount of Al3+ is increased, so is the blocking of the growth sites, resulting in the formation of smaller nanoparticles. The SnO2 and Sn0.98Al0.02O2 films made on the FTO glass were observed to be uniform with a thickness of ca. 8 μm (Fig. 2(b) and (d)).

To probe the detailed electronic structure of the SnO2 and the Al-doped SnO2, we used XPS to investigate the oxidation states at the surface. The peak positions were calibrated using the C1s peak as a reference at 284.8 eV, due to the deviation originating from the charge accumulation at the surface of the film. The spectra of Sn3d doublets and Al2p are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. Sn 3d XPS spectra also showed two peaks located at 486.7 eV and 495.2 eV, corresponding to the Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states, respectively. A slight negative shift in binding energy is apparent for Sn0.98Al0.02O2 compared to the SnO2 sample. This shift likely resulted from an electron transfer from Al to Sn (electronegativity of Sn = 1.96, Al = 1.61). These observations confirm the formation of the Al–O–Sn structure in the Al-doped SnO2 after the substitution of Sn by Al.

In general, the Fermi level of a semiconductor can be calculated by the Mott–Schottky method, (1)where C is the space charge capacitance, ε0 and ε are the dielectric constants of the free space and the film electrode, respectively, e is the electronic charge, Efb is the flat-band potential, T is the temperature, ND is the donor density, E is the applied potential, and k is Boltzmann's constant. The flat-band potential of the film Efb (Fermi level) is given by the intercept of the Mott–Schottky plot with the potential axis. When 1/C2 is zero, the X-intercept equals the flat band potential Efb. The 1/C2 values versus the applied voltages of the SnO2, Sn0.995Al0.005O2, Sn0.99Al0.01O2, Sn0.98Al0.02O2, and Sn0.97Al0.03O2 electrodes are plotted in Fig. 4. The flat-band potential levels of the SnO2, Sn0.995Al0.005O2, Sn0.99Al0.01O2, Sn0.98Al0.02O2, and Sn0.97Al0.03O2 electrodes are 0.119, 0.077, 0.014, −0.049 and −0.104 V vs. the SCE, respectively, which is consistent with the onset potential tendency.

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs fabricated using the SnO2 or Al-doped SnO2 films as a photoelectrode are shown in Fig. 5(a), and the performances are summarized in Table 2. The efficiency improvement is due to three factors: negative shift of flat-band potential, reduced charge recombination, and improved dye adsorption. The increased short-circuit current (Jsc) value is attributed to the higher specific surface area for the Al-doped SnO2 sample to enable enhanced dye loading, and the reduced charge recombination. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the cells based on SnO2, Sn0.98Al0.02O2, and Sn0.98Al0.02O2/TiCl4 are shown in Fig. S1.† This increase is in good agreement with the increase of Jsc observed in Table 2. On the other hand, the increase in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) for Al-doped films resulted from the negative shift of the flat-band potential and reduced interfacial charge recombination loss, which are characterized by EIS and IMVS analysis. When TiCl4 was used to modify the photoanode films, the performance of the DSSCs was optimized and the efficiency of the Sn0.98Al0.02O2 photoanode reached 6.91%. The photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 2, in which the characteristics of DSSCs with and without TiCl4 post-treatment are compared.

To check the charge recombination resistance after Al doping, the Nyquist plot of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the cells was measured with an alternating-current (AC) amplitude of 10 mV under an AM 1.5 illumination (Fig. 6). The corresponding equivalent circuit for EIS is shown in the inset. In the EIS Nyquist spectra, two well-defined semicircles were observed in the high-frequency (>1 kHz) and medium-frequency (1–100 Hz) regions. The high-frequency semicircle reflects the redox reaction of I−/I3− at the counter electrode, and the medium-frequency semicircle represents the electron transfer at the FTO/SnO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The Nyquist plot revealed that the recombination resistance of the cells based on Al-doped SnO2 was significantly greater than that of the SnO2-based cell.
 Fig. 6  EIS spectra of the SnO2 and the Al-doped SnO2 DSSCs. The inset of EIS plots represents the equivalent circuit for EIS. The enlarged spectra of the first semicircle are shown in Fig. S1.† 
Furthermore, the IMPS and IMVS measurements were employed to evaluate the electron transport and charge recombination processes.63,64 The electron transit time (τd) and lifetime (τn) can be calculated by the expressions τd = 1/2πfIMPS and τn = 1/2πfIMVS respectively, where fIMPS and fIMVS are the frequencies of the minimum of the IMPS and IMVS imaginary component. The IMPS results (Fig. 7) clearly illustrate that the electron transit times (τd) for the doped SnO2 cells are shorter than that for the undoped SnO2 cell. Electron lifetime (τn) derived from IMVS reflects the suppressed recombination processes in Al-doped SnO2 DSSCs, as shown in Fig. 8.

The short-circuit current (Jsc) is proportional to the light harvesting efficiency (ηlh), the electron injection efficiency (ηinj), and the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) according to the expression Jsc = qηlhηinjηccI0 (q is the elementary charge, I0 is the incident photon flux). As Katoh reported,65 the injection efficiency from excited N3 dyes to the conduction band of SnO2 is very high, suggesting that the injection process is not a limiting process for Jsc so that the electron injection efficiency (ηinj) can be equal to 1. The light harvesting efficiency (ηlh) can be directly proportional to dye loading of the photoanode films, which is constant in the same experimental condition. Using the IMPS and IMVS results, we can estimate the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) of DSSCs by the expression: ηcc = 1 − τd/τn.66,67 The obtained ηcc value for SnO2, Sn0.995Al0.005O2, Sn0.99Al0.01O2, Sn0.98Al0.02O2, and Sn0.97Al0.03O2 electrodes are 94.3%, 96.0%, 97.1%, 97.8%, and 96.9%, respectively. Thus, the short-circuit current (Jsc) is directly proportional to the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) in Al-doped SnO2.
In order to identify the effect of Sn atoms partially substituted by Al atoms on the electronic conductance of Sn1−xAlxO2, we performed a density functional theory (DFT) study of the density of states (DOS) for our materials. The calculated band gap of SnO2 is 1.97 eV, which is larger than the calculated result of 1.7 eV using the FP-LAPW method68 but is lower than the experimental value of 3.4 eV.69 It is well known that the GGA method underestimates the band gap, especially for systems with strong correlations or weak Coulomb screening. The band gap can be corrected to be 3.32 eV if a PBE + U method is adopted,70 which is nearly the same value as the experimental value. The band gap can also be corrected by the scissors operator to match the experimental value. However, even when the correction is not made, the GGA results can still predict the trend of the change of the band gap and the Fermi level shift with different doping concentrations.
For each x value, we have considered at least four substitution structures and found that there is little difference between them. Fig. 9 shows the doping model and the DOS for Sn1−xAlxO2 with different degrees of substitution. Our calculation clearly revealed a gradual shift of the Fermi level toward the valence band with Sn substituted by Al. The Fermi level shift reached 0.28 eV when the Al doping content increased from x = 0.0 to x = 0.052 (Fig. 9(c)). By contrast, the band gap is nearly unchanged when the Sn atoms are substituted by the Al atoms. The Fermi level shift downward to the valence band shows there is a p-type doping effect when Sn was substituted by Al for SnO2, consistent with our experimental observation that the conductance band shifted upward (negatively) after Al doping and an increased VOC was obtained. This is attributed to the heterovalent substitution of Sn atoms (4+) by Al atoms (3+), which introduces charge holes at the Al sites. The p-type doping increases the hole concentration and contributes to the electrical conductance. However, it also leads to two effects that diminish charge transport: one is that the increasing content of Al would introduce more impurity scattering centers to impede the electron transport, accounting for the decreased electron transit time (τd) for the doped SnO2 cells reflected in the IMPS measurements. The other effect is that the increased DOS around the EF after Al doping would increase the effective mass of holes to slow down the charge transport, according to the relation  in degenerate semiconductors (where m* is the effective mass of the carrier, and g(E) is the density of states). However, an exact and clear relationship between the p-type doping effect and the suppressed charge recombination in Al-doped SnO2 DSSCs has not yet been derived experimentally or theoretically. The surface Al2O3 layer formed on Al-doped SnO2 (Fig. 2) and the charge trapping sites in the bulk and surface of SnO2 produced by Al heterovalent doping may be most responsible for the increased electron lifetime (τn). The surface Al2O3 layer acts as a thin coated insulating layer and increases the interface resistance greatly to inhibit the electron–hole recombination. At the same time, as Durrant et al. reported, the electron injection yield, monitored by transient absorption data, is essentially unaffected by overlayers (ZrO2, Al2O3, and SiO2).71 On the other hand, the trapping sites in the bulk and at the surface would also retard the charge recombination to increase the electron lifetime.16,72

Conclusions
In this work, we prepared Al-doped SnO2 nanocrystals and studied their performance when applied as an electrode material in DSSCs. Band-edge movement and charge recombination suppression were observed after the Al3+ ions were substituted into the rutile SnO2 lattice. The simultaneous negative shift of the conduction band edges and the reduced surface recombination by Al heterovalent doping produces an increase of Voc and Jsc for Al-doped SnO2 DSSCs in comparison with the undoped cells. After post-treatment with TiCl4, highly efficient energy conversion (6.91%) for Al-doped SnO2 DSSCs can be easily obtained. Our work demonstrates that the Al-doped SnO2 nanocrystals coated with TiO2 are promising photoelectrode materials for low-cost and high-efficiency DSSCs.
