    , Accepted 25th September 2017First published on 25th September 2017AbstractTime-periodic phenomena widely exist in natural life sustaining systems but are rarely reported in highly efficient artificial electrochemical energy-harvesting systems. Herein, we observed for the first time the periodic oscillation reaction in organic-solvent dominated electrolytes that could be also derived from some electrochemical energy harvesting cells. Owing to different reaction activity and acidity in the organic solvent, the oscillation reaction could occur under milder pH conditions and exhibit better durability. Its influence on electric output and related differences from an aqueous B–Z reaction are discussed from a mechanism point of view. Our findings may contribute to smart self-oscillation materials and new strategies for highly efficient long-term energy harvesting.
1. Introduction
From the respiration of plants to the metabolism of humans, time-periodic phenomena widely exist,1,2 constructing efficient biological systems on Earth. In an endless cycle revolution, energy, and nutrition are harvested to sustain life-related chemical reactions. Its intrinsic periodical mechanisms during energy harvesting are of considerable interest. Recently, the global energy crisis has inspired various artificial biomimetic electrochemical energy-harvesting cells, including a photo-electrochemical cell (PEC)3–5 and dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC),6–8 with the aim of obtaining more energy from nature for our lives. Taking DSSC as an example,8 similar to photosynthesis in plants, dye molecules adsorbed on cell-like semiconducting nanocrystals can convert photons into electrons, accompanied by fast redox reactions inside the electrolyte. Exploring possible time-periodicity in a similar reaction system would not only help to understand the biochemical time-periodic self-organizing mechanism during energy harvesting and conversion process, but also provide possible strategies for further promoting energy conversion efficiency in various biomimetic electrochemical energy-harvesting cells.
According to dissipative structure theory,9–12 self-organizing time periodicity is a typical nonlinear behavior in a system far from the equilibrium state, which includes but is not limited to both biological and chemical reaction systems. One typical artificial chemical reaction system with self-organized periodic oscillation behavior is the Belousov–Zhabotinski reaction (B–Z reaction),13 of which both redox potential and the color would vary periodically and sustainably with time. It has been observed previously in aqueous solution during the bromate oxidation of organic acids catalysed by Fe, Ru, or Ce compounds, and numerous works have been devoted to exploring its applications in life-related processes,14–18 chemical analysis engineering,19,20 and self-oscillating materials,21–24 among others. Nevertheless, it is rarely noted that similar reactants like Ru, organic acids, or halogen compounds, also exist in various artificial photo-electrochemical systems, such as DSSC.26–28 Thus, it is possible for a simulation system of the B–Z reaction to exist in many electrochemical energy-harvesting cells.29–31 It is important but challenging to explore B–Z reactions in an organic-solvent dominated electrolyte similar to many highly-efficient energy-harvesting cells.32 The organic molecules will then dominate the solvent environment, and affect almost every elementary reaction step. This will lead to large dynamic differences in reaction activity, acidity, ions diffusion, or even dynamic mechanisms. Chemical oscillation communication over a water\benzonitrile interface was probed by R. Tomasi and cowokers.32 Although the B–Z reaction system still existed in an aqueous system, oscillation communications of catalyst species from the water phase into the benzonitrile phase were observed by probing in benzonitrile at a place of several tens of micrometers from the water\benzonitrile interface. It proved that the elementary mass-transfer step, which was essential for oscillation kinetics, could be efficient enough in an organic-solvent dominated system at an appropriate condition.
Here we have constructed for the first time two stable oscillating reaction systems in acetonitrile-dominated solution, with ionic liquids (1-ethylpyridinium iodate or 1-ethylpyridinium bromate) as the oxidant, malonic acid (MA) as the reducing agent, and Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 as the catalyst. It is noteworthy that, without addition of acid, it caused the B–Z reaction to proceed under a much milder reacting condition, and wider pH ranges in this acetonitrile solvent. Also, it could be possibly found in various photo-electrochemical energy-conversion systems, like DSSC. The solvent effects on the cation–anion interaction and ion–solvent interaction have been explored from a mechanism point of view, while the influence of the oscillation on efficiency and the electric output of electrochemical systems was discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1 Methods and materials
All the reagents, including acetonitrile, malonic acid (MA), Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6, 1-ethyl pyridinium bromate, and 1-ethylpyridinium iodate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole bromate (LinZhou Keneng Chemical Reagent Co., China), were of analytical grade, and were strictly dehydrated before being used. MA, Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6, 1-ethylpyridinium iodate or 1-ethylpyridinium bromate with the required concentrations were dissolved in acetonitrile solutions separately under ultrasonic conditions, and were then added into the reactor under strong stirring, successively. Unless specially noted, the concentrations of these reactants were 0.36 M for MA, 3.6 mM for Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6, and 0.06 M for 1-ethylpyridinium bromate. As a comparison, a similar reaction solution was prepared in aqueous H2SO4 solution (1 M) as previously reported.13 Besides, H2SO4 and ethylenediamine were employed for their pH value adjusting ability when investigating the influence of pH values.
Electrochemical tests were carried out on an electrochemical working station (CHI660D, Shanghai Chenhua Co., China), using a platinum electrode as the working electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. The UV-Vis spectrum and the absorbance oscillation profile were recorded by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-2500 PC, Beijing Persee Co., China). PH values of the solution was measured by a pH meter (PHS-25, Shanghai REX Instrument Co., China).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The oscillation reaction in an acetonitrile-dominated electrolyte
During the long-term working process of DSSC, it is possible for similar reactants as those in the B–Z reaction system to accumulate around the photoanode (Fig. 1a). For example, small organic acids, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, and transition metal ions may be derived from the degradation of dye molecules. Besides, halogen ions in the electrolyte can be also oxidized into halogen acid on the photoanode.

(b) Potential oscillation profile in acetonitrile solution (0.36 M for MA as reducer, 3.6 mM for Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 as catalyst, 0.06 M for 1-ethylpyridinium bromate as oxidant) and aqueous solution (0.36 M for MA as reducer, 3.6 mM for Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 as catalyst, 0.06 M for 1-ethylpyridinium bromate as oxidant, 1 M H2SO4 as acid). (c) Scheme of the B–Z oscillation reaction mechanism. (d) A typical potential waveform of the oscillation reaction. 
The reaction system, with Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 as the catalyst, 1-ethylpyridinium bromate as the oxidant, malonic acid as the reducer, but no additional acid, achieved a periodic potential oscillation after 640 s upon mixing (Fig. 1b) of which the duration is considerably longer than that in the aqueous solution for such a closed system. The time interval prior to oscillation can be defined as the induction period. After the induction period, oscillation occurs, with its amplitude gradually increased to over 170 mV. However, the amplitude of oscillation in a similar aqueous solution would gradually decrease in a relatively short time, while the B–Z oscillation in an organic solution lasts considerably longer, as shown in Fig. 1b. Such differences in oscillation profile clearly indicated a notable solvent effect of acetonitrile on the reaction mechanism.
It is noteworthy that stable potential oscillation also arises when employing 1-ethylpyridinium iodate as the oxidant in a similar acetonitrile solution as that employing 1-ethylpyridinium bromate as the oxidant. Herein, the electrolyte contains iodate ions, MA, and a Ce-type catalyst. It is similar to but different from a typical Briggs–Rauscher reaction system or Bray–Liebhafsky reaction system,33,34 which always contain peroxide compounds as one oxidant. Besides, it is also different from a typical Landolt reaction system,35 which contains another reagent to reduce iodine compounds into I−. In previously reported works, malonic acid failed to have any measurable effect on the classical Landolt reaction system in an aqueous solution. Our success in realizing iodate-based oscillators using MA may be evidence for the contribution of solvent effects.
3.2 Possible mechanism of the periodic oscillation
The Field–Kôrös–Neyes (FKN) mechanism is well-known as the reaction scheme for the traditional B–Z reaction in aqueous solution (Fig. 1c) in which bromate acts as the oxidant. According to the classical FKN model,36 with transition metal compound catalysts like Ce or Ru, bromomalonic acid is produced at the beginning due to the oxidation of MA by bromate. In an appropriate range of bromomalonic acid concentrations, the oscillation is triggered. Then, the overall B–Z oscillation can be divided into three possible sub-processes: consumption of the bromide ion (sub-process A, eqn (1)–(3)), autocatalytic redox reaction of bromous acid with oxidation of the transition metal catalyst (sub-process B, eqn (4)–(6)), and production of bromomalonic acid and the proton, accompanied by the re-reduction of the catalyst (sub-process C, eqn (7)–(10)).
Process A (consumption of bromide ion) Br− + HBrO + H+ ⇆ Br2 + H2O(1) Br− + HBrO2 + H+ → 2HOBr(2) Br− + BrO3− + 2H+ → HOBr + HBrO2(3)Process B (oxidation of Catalyst(R), autocatalytic reaction) 2HBrO2 → HOBr + BrO3− + H+(4) HBrO2 + BrO3− + H+ ⇆ 2BrO2 + H2O(5) BrO2 + Catalyst(R) + H+ ⇆ HBrO2 + Catalyst(O)(6)Process C (reduction of Catalyst(O), production of bromo-malonic acid) BrO2 + Catalyst(O) + H2O → BrO3− + Catalyst(R) + 2H+(7) Br2 + CH2(COOH)2 → BrCH(COOH)2 + Br− + H+(8) 6Catalyst(O) + CH2(COOH)2 + 2H2O → 6Catalyst(R) + HCOOH + 2CO2 + 6H+(9) 4Catalyst(O) + BrCH(COOH)2 + 2H2O → 4Catalyst(R) + HCOOH + Br− + 2CO2 + 5H+(10)where Catalyst(O) and Catalyst(R) represent the oxidized-state and the reduced-state of the catalyst, respectively.
In aqueous solution, each of the 10 steps above is elementary or at least has well-studied kinetics.38 The above reaction scheme could be simplified using the Oregonator model.36 The Oregonator dynamics is an activator/inhibitor system containing both an autocatalytic step and a delayed negative feedback loop. It is composed of five coupled stoichiometries shown below. A + Y → X + P  Rate = kM1AY(11) X + Y → P  Rate = kM2XY(12) B + X → 2X + Z  Rate = kM3BX(13) X + X → Q  Rate = kM4X2(14) Z → fY  Rate = fkM5Z(15)where X = HBrO2, Y = Br−, Z = Ce(IV), A = B = BrO3−, P and Q represent reaction products like HOBr or BrCH(COOH)2. The reactant and product species BrO3−, MA, BrCH(COOH)2 and HBrO are normally present in much higher concentrations than the dynamic intermediate species X, Y, and Z, and are assumed to be constant on the time scale of a few oscillations. Therefore, the Oregonator Mass-Action dynamics in a well-stirred, homogeneous system could be given by the following equations. dX/dt = kM1AY − kM2XY + kM3AX − 2kM4X2(16) dY/dt = −kM1AY − kM2XY + kM5fBZ(17) dZ/dt = kM3AX − kM5BZ(18)The potential oscillation is then defined by the periodic concentration change of some intermediate reactant, such as HBrO2, Br− and the catalyst etc., based on the Nernst equation. Accordingly, electrode potential will increase with the concentration of the oxidized-state catalyst increasing during the sub-process B and decrease with concentration of the oxidized-state catalyst decreasing during the sub-process C.
Theoretically, the oscillation dynamic behaviour around the bifurcation point could be analysed based on above equations using the mathematical linear instability analysis method.37 Nevertheless, the calculation process should be further simplified in order to give clear explicit expressions for their frequency and amplitude. Taking HBrO2 as an example, the steady-state approximation is valid at a state not far from the steady state. In the aqueous system, its concentration ([HBrO2]) could be calculated as follows:38 d[HBrO2]/dt = −α[HBrO2]2 − β[HBrO2] + γ(19)where, α = 2k4(20) β = k2[Br−][H+] − k5[BrO3−][H+] + (2k5[BrO3−][H+] + k-6[Ce4+])k7[Ce4+]/(k6[Ce3+][H+] + k7[Ce4+])(21) γ = k3[BrO3−][Br−][H+]2(22)Herein, β and γ should be considered as variations with time, because [Br−], [Ce3+] and [Ce4+] would all vary with time at the same frequency as [HBrO2].
In the organic solution, each period of the oscillation process can be also divided into three sub-processes sections, corresponding to the slope of the redox potential waveform (Fig. 1d). A complete oscillation period is the sum of each sub-process, and will be affected by the reaction kinetics of each sub-process.25,36 The division of the sub-process could be further confirmed by the color change of the solution in a reaction circle. As is indicated in Fig. 1d, it would change periodically between orange and yellow, synchronizing the potential change.
A UV-Vis spectra method was also employed to track the concentration variation of different species. As summarized in Fig. 2, both the characteristic absorption of some intermediate species from 1-ethylpyridinium bromate (abbreviated as IL-bromate, wavelength = 259 nm) and that from the Ce(IV) catalyst (abbreviated as Ce(IV), wavelength = 330 nm) would periodically fluctuate with time at the same frequency, verifying that the reaction scheme of the cerium catalyzed oscillation reaction in acetonitrile also follows the FKN mechanism.

Furthermore, although the FKN model has been rarely applied to iodate-based oscillators, the only difference between our iodate reaction system and a classical B–Z reaction system is the difference between the IO3− and BrO3−. Taking consideration of the similarity of our iodate reaction system and the B–Z reaction system, we also chose to take the FKN model to explain the mechanism, as in eqn (1)–(10).
3.3 The influence of the proton and the water molecules
Theoretically, kinetic parameters for quite a few elementary reactions in an organic-solvent dominated system should be different from that in water. For one thing, both the cation–anion interaction and ion–solvent interaction in an organic solution would be largely different from that in an aqueous solution, leading to different dissociation states of ions pairs. For another thing, ions in acetonitrile will no longer form a hydronium ion as those in an aqueous solution, but stay as a stronger Lewis acid.39 These factors should undoubtedly affect the oscillation behavior.
As is indicated in Fig. 3a, oscillation only occurs under a strong acidic condition in aqueous solution. Oscillation markedly weakened or disappeared as the pH value increased beyond zero in an aqueous B–Z solution. However, in the organic acetonitrile solvent, steady oscillation could be observed under a milder pH condition (with no addition of any acid), and with a much wider pH range, that is from pH = −1 to pH = 2. From a mechanism point of view, proton activity would affect not only the reaction rate of the sub-process A and B, but also the redox potential during the sub-process B. The construction of a milder B–Z reaction system would broaden its application on smart self-oscillation materials, such as biomimetic actuators, memory devices and chemo-mechanical materials for energy transition of chemical power to mechanical force.
 Fig. 3  (a) Variation in period and amplitude with pH value in both aqueous solution and acetonitrile solution. (b) Influence of water content on oscillation in the acetonitrile solution (pH = 0.5). The reaction system contains 0.36 M of MA as the reducer, 3.6 mM of Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 as the catalyst, and 0.06 M of 1-ethylpyridinium bromate as the oxidant for both acetonitrile system and water system. 
Besides, the concentration of water ([H2O]) in the organic B–Z reaction system is only a trace amount, much lower than that in the aqueous solution. Unlike that in the aqueous system, [H2O] could not be simply regarded as a constant. Thus, certain kinetic parameters for reactions in the organic-solvent dominated system should be regarded as variations of ki[H2O] (i = 5, 7, 9, 10), as is also discussed in ESI,† Note S3.
By considering the effects of H+ and H2O, the kinetic eqn (19) should be modified with a new set of α, β and γ. α = 2k4(24) β = (k2[Br−] − k5[BrO3−])δ[H+] + (2k5[BrO3−]δ[H+] + k−6[Ce4+])k7[Ce4+][H2O]/(k6[Ce3+]δ[H+] + k7[Ce4+][H2O])(25) γ = k3[BrO3−][Br−](δ[H+])2(26)where δ indicates the solvent effects on the activity of H+.
Letting β0 represent the value of β at the steady state. The oscillation period (T) at a place not far from the bifurcation point could be subsequently derived. T = |2π/ω| = |2π/β0|(27)It is complicated to give a precise and explicit expression for the oscillation amplitude. Nevertheless, the oscillation amplitude (Amp) could be approximately estimated from the concentration difference between the peak point and the valley point, when [H2O] is very low. Amp = −(RT/zF)ln([HBrO2]peak[Br−]valley/[HBrO2]valley[Br−]peak) = (RT/zF)ln{(k52[BrO3−]2 − k22[Br−]2) + (k5[BrO3−] − k2[Br−]k−6[Ce4+]peak/δ[H+])/2k3k4[BrO3−][Br−]}(28)It could be derived from eqn (27) and (28) that, both the amplitude and frequency would decrease with [H+] at a suitable range of [H+]. When [H+] is too small, the oscillation would disappear. Nevertheless, when δ[H+] is large enough, β could be simplified as β = (k2[Br−] − k5[BrO3−])δ[H+] + 2k5[BrO3−]k7[Ce4+][H2O]/(k6[Ce3+] + k7[Ce4+][H2O]/δ[H+])(29)which would be larger than 0 and increase with δ[H+]. Then, T would increase with δ[H+]. As is shown, the turning point for the period and amplitude is determined by δ[H+]. As is discussed above, the δ in organic-solvent dominated system is larger than that in water, which explains why the turning point for the period and amplitude moves towards the direction of the milder pH value.
In order to further confirm the derivation, the influence of the water molecules on the organic B–Z reaction was further investigated. As a matter of fact, water molecules are essential for the B–Z reaction system even in an organic solution, according to the FKN mechanism. On one hand, water molecules participate in the B–Z reaction as a reactant (eqn (1), (9) and (10)). At a lower water concentration, the consumption of MA in the sub-process C would be considerably slower and could lead to better durability of the oscillation. On the other hand, water molecules would be produced in the B–Z reaction itself (eqn (1) and (5)). At an extremely low initial content of water, water molecules may accumulate for a period of time to reach the critical concentration point.
As is indicated in Fig. 3b, trace amounts of additional water were introduced. The oscillation period thus would increase with the content of water. Meanwhile, the influence of water on oscillation amplitude is negligible at a [H2O] of <0.02 M. At a higher [H2O], the amplitude would then rapidly decrease as the [H2O] increased. According to eqn (27), dT/d[H2O] = (2π/β02)dβ/d[H2O]|0, where dβ/d[H2O]|0 is the slope around the steady state. Furthermore, it could also be derived from eqn (25) that, dβ/d[H2O]|0 > 0, and β0 < 0. Thus, dT/d[H2O] > 0. As the [H2O] increases, oscillation frequency decreases and oscillation period increases. Besides, eqn (28) is valid in a certain range of [H2O]. Within this range, the amplitude has no obvious relationship with the [H2O]. When [H2O] continues to increase, then the term of k7[Ce4+][H2O]/(k6[Ce3+]δ[H+] + k7[Ce4+][H2O]) in eqn (25) could not be ignored as it could in eqn (28). This dynamic term will increase with [H2O], resulting in a decrease of oscillation amplitude. The results in Fig. 3b match well with our mechanism.
3.4 The influence of various reactants
As discussed above, the oscillation system could be derived from possible by-products in some photo-electrochemical cells, of which their concentration would increase with time during their long-term working. In order to reveal their reaction differences from that in the aqueous solution, the influence of various reactants on the B–Z reaction in the organic solvent were systematically investigated.
First, for classical B–Z oscillatory reactions, at least, the bromate type oxidant was inorganic, of which the solubility in organic solvent was very poor. Herein, we have for the first time introduced novel ionic-liquid-type bromate salts as the oxidant. The bulky organic cations played an important role in promoting the solubility of bromate anions in the organic solvent, while the cation–anion interaction would be critical for the oscillation. Thus, organic oxidants with the same bulky cation of 1-ethylpyridinium but different halate anions (chlorate, bromate and iodate) are compared in Fig. 4a and ESI,† Fig. S2. With the same low concentration of 0.06 M, only the reaction system employing bromate as the oxidant achieved a stable potential oscillation. However, at a much higher concentration of 0.19 M, stable oscillation was also observed in the iodate-based system. This could be attributed to different oxidation activities for chlorate, bromate and iodate. For chlorate, although its corresponding redox potential is higher than that of both bromate and iodate, its molecular stability is very good. Therefore, the dynamic oxidation activities of chlorates are too low to trigger the oscillation reaction. For iodates, although they are as dynamically unstable as the bromates, the corresponding redox potential is the lowest among the three. Iodate requires a higher concentration to reach enough oxidation rate to maintain the oscillation. Iodine compounds are widely employed in various typical photo-electrochemical cells. Their influence on the oscillation and its relationship with these photo-electrochemical cells may be important for further performance promotion.
 Fig. 4  (a) Comparison between two types of oxidants with different halate anion: 1-ethylpyridinium bromate (0.06 M) and 1-ethylpyridinium iodate (0.19 M). (b and c) Influence of the bromate (abbreviated as [BrO3−]) on oscillation features: the period and amplitude (b), and induction period (c); (d and e) influence of the malonic acid (abbreviated as [MA]) on oscillation features: the period and amplitude (d), and induction period (e); (f) influence of the [Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6]. (abbreviated as [Ce]) on oscillation features. Unless specially noted, the concentration of components was 0.36 M for MA as the reducer, 3.6 mM for Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 as the catalyst, 0.06 M for 1-ethylpyridinium bromate as the oxidant. 
Additionally, the oscillation reaction employed bromate oxidants with different bulky cations which were compared (ESI,† Fig. S3). Evident oscillation was observed when employing 1-ethylpyridinium bromate rather than 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole bromate. That has undoubtedly verified the critical influence of the cation–anion interaction on the oscillation. The ionization in acetonitrile is considerably weaker than that in water. Therefore, the interaction between cation and anion in acetonitrile would be markedly strong. With shorter length of the alkyl group on the bulky cation, like 1-ethylpyridinium, the coulomb force between bulky cations and bromate anions may be weaker, which allows better mobility and activity for anions, and would accordingly affect the oscillation profiles.
Second, the influence of 1-ethylpyridinium bromate concentration (abbreviated as [BrO3−]) is summarized in Fig. 4b and c. As is indicated in eqn (27) and (28), the influence of [BrO3−] on the amplitude or the period is not repetitive, which matched with our experimental observation. Both amplitude and the period would first increase and then decrease as the [BrO3−] increases. At a concentration of 0.048 M, the oscillation amplitude reached up to 275 mV. According to the FKN mechanism, redox potential is determined by the concentration ratio of oxidized-state catalyst to reduced-state catalyst. The redox potential reaches the peak at the end of the sub-process B and falls off to the bottom at the end of the sub-process C. With lower [BrO3−], less oxidized-state catalysts would be present at the end of the sub-process B, leading to lower peak potential. With higher [BrO3−], more oxidized-state catalysts remained at the end of the sub-process C, leading to higher valley potential. According to the difference in the peak potential and the valley potential, the maximum oscillation amplitude could only be achieved at a suitable [BrO3−]. Furthermore, the induction period increases initially and then decreases as the [BrO3−] increases, reaching up to 850 s at 0.086 M. According to the classic interpretation of the BZ induction period,40,41 the length of the induction period is connected with reactions (8) and (10), two of which compete with each other, while not explicitly depending on the concentration of bromate. The influence of the [BrO3−] on the induction period may be the result of a complicated dynamic equilibrium, of which the detailed mechanism is still under investigation.
Third, the influence of the malonic acid concentration abbreviated as [MA], which serves as the reducing agent, was investigated. Similarly, both amplitude and period first increased and then decreased as MA concentration increased (Fig. 4d). Besides, induction period first increased and then decreased as [MA] increases (Fig. 4e). The influence of MA concentration may be attributed to a similar mechanism as that of the 1-ethylpyridinium bromate.
Finally, the influence of the Ce(NH4)2(NO3)6 concentration (abbreviated as [Ce]) is indicated in Fig. 4f. The amplitude increases with increase of [Ce]. According to eqn (28), the amplitude would increase with [Ce4+]peak. At a higher overall concentration of [Ce], the [Ce4+]peak would be higher, leading to a larger amplitude. Meanwhile, more catalyst molecules need to be converted during sub-processes B and C at higher catalyst concentration, thereby extending the period. However, the reaction rate of the sub-processes B and C would also increase with increase of [Ce], leading to a slow decrease in the period at high [Ce].
Notably, potential oscillation would lead to a periodic increase of the voltage output. The amplitude of the potential oscillation can even take up 21% of the instantaneous voltage. In previous studies on electrochemical energy conversion systems, such as DSSC,8 electric output is usually considered as direct-current type. Its energy output (W) for a certain period of time (t) can be calculated by a multiplication method: W = V × I × Δt(30)Instead, when oscillation occurs, the instantaneous power output would increase with voltage output. Thus, the energy output for a certain period of time (t) should be calculated by an integration method. (31)Then, the energy output would increase with the amplitude and waveform variation of the oscillation. Traditionally, by-products from the long-term working process were regarded as a hazard to the system. This study supposed a different possibility; that is, these by-products may lead to an instructive change of the output waveform, which could be utilized to enhance the electric output, based on an insight into the oscillation mechanism.
4. Conclusions
The B–Z reaction system was successfully established in an acetonitrile solution in this study. The influence of different reactants on oscillation was discussed from a mechanism point of view. Due to different proton activities and ionization behaviors, the B–Z reaction studied in this work achieved a stable potential oscillation under milder pH conditions, and with much wider pH range, while following the scheme of the FKN mechanism. Periodic oscillation behavior in this type of system may provide new insights into the influence of various by-products or reaction intermediates during long-term operations of certain energy harvesting cells, such as DSSCs. Our study contributes to new strategies for developing novel highly-efficient energy conversion technologies. Furthermore, the B–Z reaction in acetonitrile solution could take place under milder pH conditions, owing to the solvent effect, thus expanding its potential applications in smart materials based on self-oscillating gels.
