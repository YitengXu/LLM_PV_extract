The perovskite layer plays a critical role in light-to-electricity conversion. Here we study the effects of alkali metal ion dopants on the growth, structure and properties of perovskite films and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. At a low doping level, the alkali metal ions can significantly affect the formation and properties of the perovskite films. They can enhance the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) significantly. The Jsc increases significantly from 19.2 mA cm−2 to 21.0 mA cm−2 and 20.3 mA cm−2 for the PSCs with a methylammonium lead triode layer doped with 0.5 mol% K+ and 0.25 mol% Na+, respectively, and the fill factor (FF) increases from 0.74 to 0.79 for the devices with both doping ions. Correspondingly, the PCE increases from 13.7% to 15.3% and 14.6% for the PSCs, respectively. The efficiency improvement by K+ or Na+ doping is attributed to their effect in increasing the crystallinity and crystallite size of the perovskite films.
Introduction
Organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their high photovoltaic efficiency and low fabrication cost. The high photovoltaic efficiency is related to the appealing features of the perovskites, such as optimal band gaps, high absorption coefficients, small exciton binding energy, long carrier lifetimes and long exciton diffusion lengths.1–8 Great progress has been made in PSCs since 2012. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20% or even higher was reported for PSCs fabricated by different approaches, including vapor deposition, two-step sequential deposition or one-step deposition with solvent engineering.9–11 These values exceed the commercial energy conversion efficiency threshold for solar cell applications.12 The perovskite layer of PSCs plays a critical role in the photovoltaic performance. Its morphology and properties can be affected by the precursors, deposition conditions, post-treatment conditions, and so on.13–16 For instance, the structure and properties of perovskites can be well tuned by using two or more lead compounds with different halides or non-halide anions and/or compounds with different organic cations.15,17,18 Meanwhile, the band gap and electronic properties of methylammonium lead triiodide can be tailored by incorporating metal cations such as Pb and Sn,19–21 inorganic anions such as Br and Cl,22–25 or organic cations such as ethylammonium and formamidinium.26–29 One example is that the bandgap of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the corresponding PSCs increase with increasing x value.22–25 Doping of methylammonium perovskites with formamidinium can lower the band gap and increase the light absorption of the perovskites.26–28 In our previous report, we observed that the precursor composition has a significant effect on the properties of perovskite thin films and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.10 For alkali metal doped perovskites, several studies have been reported previously.30–34 For example, incorporating a mixture of cesium (Cs) cations into a perovskite could enhance the performance and stability of perovskite devices.30–33 By tuning the tolerance factor and reducing the trap density, devices with an efficiency of over 20% and good photo/moisture stability were demonstrated.30,33 Chu et al. also used alkali metal salts as additives for perovskite films. They found that these alkali metal halides could chelate with Pb2+ ions and thus lead to the formation of nanostructured PbI2 films and an increase in the crystallinity of the perovskite films. Meanwhile, the alkali metal halides could recrystallize the small grains and passivate the grain boundaries and interface states, thus facilitating charge generation and dissociation in perovskite films.34
In this work, we investigated the effect of alkali metal ion doping on the structure and properties of perovskites and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. KI or NaI was introduced into the precursor solutions of methylammonium lead triiodide. The incorporation of alkaline metal ions can affect the formation, absorption and charge transport of the perovskite films. At a low doping level, they can significantly increase the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and thus the PCE of PSCs.
Results and discussion
The PSC architecture is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. The PSCs are represented by ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/LiF/Al. The energy levels of the electronic materials are displayed in Fig. 1b. Fig. 2 and S1† show the current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics and steady-state PCE at the maximum power point as a function of time of the devices fabricated under the same experimental conditions. Voc, Jsc, fill factor (FF), and PCE of all devices are summarized in Table 1. The incorporation of the alkali metal ions significantly affects the device performance. The average efficiency is 12.8% for the control PSCs with pure MAPbI3. The Jsc, Voc, and FF values are 19.2 mA cm−2, 0.93 V, and 0.73, respectively. These values are comparable to those reported in the literature for MAPbI3-based PSCs.13 The incorporation of K+ into MAPbI3 significantly affects the Jsc and FF of PSCs. The Jsc increases from 19.2 mA cm−2 to 19.6 mA cm−2 and 20.5 mA cm−2, and the FF increases from 0.73 to 0.78 and 0.79 at the K+ doping levels of 0.25 mol% and 0.5 mol%, respectively. Correspondingly, the PCE increases from 12.8% to 14.3% and 14.8%, respectively. Although Jsc shows the maximum value of 21.7 mA cm−2 at a K+ doping degree of 1 mol%, the Voc and FF decrease to 0.83 V and 0.65, respectively. Accordingly, the PCE of the PSC with 1.0 mol% K+ doping is only 11.7%. Presumably, it may be due to the shunt leakage induced by the doping ions or recrystallization effect.34 The champion PCE is 15.31% with a Jsc of 20.95 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.94 V, and a FF of 0.79 for the PSCs with 0.5 mol% K+ doping.

Doping of the perovskite layer with Na+ also affects the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. At the Na+ doping molar degrees of 0.25 mol% and 0.5 mol%, Jsc increases from 19.2 mA cm−2 to 20.1 mA cm−2 and 19.5 mA cm−2, respectively, and the FF increases from 0.73 to 0.78 for both the doping degrees. As a result, the PCE increases to 14.2% and 14.0%, respectively. However, when the Na+ doping degree is further increased to 1.0 mol%, all the Jsc, Voc and FF of PSCs dramatically decrease, and the PCE drops to 7.1%. The decrease in the Jsc, Voc and FF is probably a result of a large charge recombination and leakage current in the device induced by the Na+ ions. In addition, in order to check the device reproducibility, 20 devices were fabricated in 3 batches. The PSCs with K+ or Na+ doping exhibited narrow distributions in the photovoltaic performances, similar to those of the control devices (Fig. 2c and d).
In order to further understand the effect of the alkali metal ion doping on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs, the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of the devices were obtained from the J–V curves. The Rs is 2.41 Ω cm2 for the device with pure MAPbI3. It decreases to 1.38 Ω cm2 and 2.01 Ω cm2 for the devices with 0.5 mol% K+ and 0.25 mol% Na+, respectively. The Rsh is 25.0 kΩ cm2 for the control device. It increases to 30.1 kΩ cm2 and 44.2 kΩ cm2 for the devices with 0.5 mol% K+ and 0.25 mol% Na+, respectively. The decrease in Rs and increase in Rsh are consistent with the enhancement in the photovoltaic efficiency.
In order to gain a deep understanding of the improvement of the Jsc and FF by K+ doping, the photocurrent (Jph) is plotted as a function of the effective voltage (Veff). Jph is obtained by subtracting the current density in the dark from the current density under illumination. Veff, which reflects the internal field in the device, is defined as Veff = Vo − Va, where Vo is the compensation voltage defined as the voltage where Jph = 0, and Va is the applied bias. As shown in Fig. S2,† the PSC with 0.5 mol% K+ doping exhibits a higher Jph from the open-circuit condition to the short-circuit condition in comparison with the control PSC, indicating higher charge collection efficiency and less loss arising from the charge recombination.
To gain insight into the charge recombination of the solar cells, perovskite solar cells were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). There were two semicircles in the EIS spectra, and they were analysed with an equivalent circuit model (inset of Fig. S3†).35 The recombination resistance (Rrec) is inversely related to the recombination rate, and it is dependent on the applied bias (Fig. S3†). The Rrec decreases exponentially with the increase of the bias. The Rrec–bias relationship is related to the recombination mechanism.35 The Rrec of KI and NaI doped perovskite devices is substantially higher than that of the devices with undoped perovskites in a wide bias range. This indicates that the former has a lower carrier recombination rate.
The effect of alkali metal ion incorporation is further investigated by measuring the internal photo-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of PSCs. The IPCE spectra provide information on the conversion of the photons to the collected charges in a wavelength range. As shown in Fig. 2e and f, K+ or Na+ doping at a low degree could enhance the IPCE within the wavelength range from 550 nm to 800 nm. However, the IPCE value decreases when the K+ or Na+ doping degree is higher than 1 mol%. This can be due to the increase in charge recombination by the excess dopants.
Hysteresis in the J–V curves of the PSCs was also studied. Hysteresis is often observed for PSCs, and it is attributed to a number of factors, such as trapping/detrapping of charge carriers,36,37 ferroelectricity,38,39 and ion migration.36,40 As shown in Fig. 3 and S1,† there is no significant hysteresis for the forward and reverse J–V curves of the best performing device. The device parameters and efficiency are almost the same along the two scanning directions and with different scan rates. The negligible hysteresis is related to the improved film quality and planar heterojunction structure with fullerene passivation.30–33,37 However, remarkable hysteresis appears for the devices with a high doping degree of K+ or Na+. This may be due to the charge trapping/detrapping centers induced by the scattering effect of the excess Na+ ions.36

The crystallinity of the perovskite films is a key factor for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs as well because it can affect the charge dissociation, charge transport, and charge diffusion length.41 The crystallinity of the perovskite films with and without doping was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 4, the pure CH3NH3PbI3 films showed strong diffraction peaks at 14.2°, 28.5°, and 31.9°. These diffraction patterns are assigned to the (110), (220), and (310) crystal planes of tetragonal perovskite, respectively. The XRD results indicate a highly crystalline nature with the (110) plane preferentially oriented. The peak positions are consistent with the results reported previously.10,42 At a high doping level, the XRD pattern of the PbI2 peak at around 12.6° could be observed. Although PbI2 can have a passivation effect,42 the effect can be mainly due to the ion doping since the PbI2 ratio is very small and has little effect on the energy level and crystal size of the film.29 For K+ doped perovskite (up to 1.0 mol%), the intensity of the diffraction patterns was significantly enhanced. It suggests an improvement in the crystallinity of the thin films. The same phenomenon was observed for the Na+ doped perovskite thin films. But the peak position at 14.16° slightly shifts to 14.06° by Na+ doping (Fig. S4†). The Na+ doping can thus slightly expand the crystal cell. This suggests that the Na+ ions may be mainly incorporated into the interstitial sites of MAPbI3 rather than substituting the MA+ sites since the ionic radius of Na+ is much smaller than that of MA+.43,44 This is consistent with the photovoltaic performance. The Na+ ions mainly occupy the interstitial sites at a low doping degree. They can increase Jsc.44–46 While at a high doping degree, the excess Na+ ions can act as charge trap centers. Moreover, at a high doping degree, some Na+ ions may occupy some substitution sites. They thus induce crystal distortion and decrease the film stability, which will be further discussed later.45,46
 Fig. 4  XRD patterns of an undoped MAPbI3 film and MAPbI3 films doped with (a) K+ and (b) Na+. 
The K+ or Na+ doping can also affect the grain size of the perovskite films as evidenced by their effect on the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD patterns. Both the Na+ and K+ doping decrease the FWHM of the XRD patterns. This change suggests the increase in the grain size. The grain sizes were estimated in terms of the Scherrer equation. They are 195 ± 20 nm, 221 ± 20 nm and 374 ± 20 nm for the undoped MAPbI3 film and MAPbI3 films doped with 1.0 mol% K+ and 1.0 mol% Na+, respectively. The increase in the crystallinity and the grain size contributes to the significant enhancement in Jsc and PCE. At higher doping levels (1.0 mol% or higher), the doping ions lead to more charge recombination and thus lower the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites can have a two-dimensional or three-dimensional structure depending on the ion size. The three-dimensional structure of MAPbI3 can be distorted when it is doped with larger or smaller ions. The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t), t = (rA + rX)/[21/2(rB + rX)], where rA and rB are effective ionic radii of the cations and rX is the anion radius, was employed to evaluate the effect of K+ or Na+ doping on the crystal structure of MAPbI3.45 The effective radii of MA+, Na+ and K+ are 217, 102 and 138 pm, respectively. For the perovskites with Pb2+ and I− to have a three-dimensional structure, the radius of the cation should be in the range from 116 nm that corresponds to t = 0.7 to 259 nm that corresponds to t = 1. Since the Na+ radius is out of this range, the Na+ doping can distort the perovskite crystal structure, and decrease the film stability.45 This is consistent with the XRD results. The distortion in the crystal structure can thus affect the charge transport and charge recombination in the perovskite films.
The absorption spectra of MAPbI3 films with different K+ or Na+ doping degrees are shown in Fig. 5. Regardless of doped or undoped, the perovskite thin films exhibit strong absorption from the visible range down to the near-infrared wavelengths with the absorption onset at ca. 780–785 nm that corresponds to an optical band gap of 1.58 eV. Although the Na+ or K+ doping does not affect the shape of the absorption spectrum,13 it increases the absorption intensity of the perovskite films with the same thickness. This can be ascribed to the increase in the crystallinity by the K+ or Na+ doping. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, if Na+ ions or K+ ions completely substitute MA+ ions, the perovskites should have large band gaps of around 1.70 and 1.72 eV, respectively. They are larger than that of MAPbI3.47 But the absorption onset of CH3NH3PbI3 does not change in the presence of K+ and Na+ because of the low doping degrees.

The effect of Na+ or K+ doping on the photophysics of MAPbI3 was investigated by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The samples were prepared on glass substrates with neither the hole transporting material nor the electron transporting material to avoid exciton quenching by these materials. The alkaline metal ion incorporation enhances the PL intensity, indicating a decreased nonradiative recombination in the perovskite thin films (Fig. 6). All the factors, including the higher crystallinity, more light absorption and less nonradiative recombination, contribute to the increase in Jsc.
 Fig. 6  PL spectra of an undoped MAPbI3 film and MAPbI3 films doped with (a) K+ and (b) Na+. 
The perovskite thin film morphology without and with alkaline metal ions on PEDOT:PSS/ITO glass substrates was further investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). As shown in Fig. 7, all the perovskite films whether they are doped or not are uniform with large regular crystallites, and they fully cover the underlying layer. The good thin film uniformity and coverage suggest a homogenous nucleation of the perovskites on the PEDOT:PSS surface. The SEM images also indicate the effect of the Na+ or K+ doping level on the morphology of the perovskite films. For K+ doping, the perovskite films are more uniform, and the crystallites are larger. Hence, the K+ doping can increase the short-circuit current density and PCE of PSCs. The Na+ doping ratio has a more significant effect on the morphology of the perovskite films. At 0.5 mol% Na+ doping, the perovskite films are uniform and free of pinholes. Large grains of micrometer size can be observed when the Na+ doping degree is 1.0 mol%. Similar to K+ ions, the Na+ ions can also promote the growth of large perovskite crystallites. As discussed above, the Na+ ions can distort the crystal structure of MAPbI3 because of the small ion size. It is thus reasonable to infer that Na+ ions can change the crystallization of MAPbI3. However, pinholes appear between the large crystallites. The pinholes can lead to large current leakage and consequently lower the PCE of PSCs. This explains why the PSCs with a Na+ doping degree of 1.0 mol% or higher exhibit quite low PCEs. The elemental mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis were also carried out to investigate the ion doping in the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. S5–S8,† the element signal at the grain boundaries is not obviously different from the grains, indicating that the ions are homogeneously distributed.

To investigate the photo-conversion process associated with the alkaline metal dopants in the perovskite phase, time-resolved PL (TR-PL) measurements were carried out on thin films prepared on glass substrates. The PL decay curves were fitted with a bi-exponential decay function including a fast decay and a slow decay process.48 Generally, the fast decay process originates from photo-excited charge carrier trapping by defect states or transporting to electron or hole interlayers, while the slow decay process presents the radiative decay process. The PL decays of the three samples are shown in Fig. 8, and the related parameters are summarized in Table 2. For the K+ doped film, the fast decay lifetime is 6.33 ns, and the slow decay lifetime is about 33.91 ns. As for the Na+ doped perovskite thin film, the fast decay lifetime is 7.85 ns, and the slow decay lifetime is 43.71 ns. These TR-PL results matched with the characterization results discussed above. Alkaline metal doped samples exhibited a higher Jsc, FF and PCE compared to their counterparts, and their PL decay lifetime was enhanced, indicating that alkaline metal doping would reduce defect density which suppresses non-radiative recombination in the photo-conversion process.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have studied the effects of alkaline metal ion doping on the structure and properties of CH3NH3PbI3 films and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The Na+ or K+ doping can increase the grain size of the perovskite film. They can thus improve the charge carrier lifetime. At a low doping degree, both the Na+ and K+ doping can significantly increase the Jsc and FF and thus the PCE of PSCs. At the optimal doping of 0.5 mol% K+, Jsc increases from 19.2 mA cm−2 to 21.0 mA cm−2, and the FF increases from 0.74 to 0.79. Correspondingly, the PCE increases from 13.8% to 15.3%. This work suggests a feasible avenue to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.

All materials are used without further purification.
Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
ITO glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol by sonication for 20 min each. After drying under a N2 stream, the substrates were further treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. A PEDOT:PSS layer with a thickness of ∼40 nm was prepared by spin coating Clevios 4083 on ITO substrates at 8000 rpm for 1 min and subsequently annealed at 140 °C for 15 min in air. The substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS were then transferred into a glovebox filled with highly pure N2. The perovskite layer was formed by spin coating a solution consisting of 1.4 M PbI2, MAI and KI (or NaI) in a co-solvent of DMSO:GBL (3:7 vol. ratio) at 1000 rpm for 20 s, and then at 5000 rpm for 60 s. The total concentration of MAI and KI (or NaI) was 1.4 M in the solutions. After 45 s from the start of the spin coating, 200 μL toluene was dripped. Then, they were annealed at 100 °C for 12 min. The thickness of the perovskite thin films was around 260 nm. The PCBM layer with a thickness of about 60 nm was deposited by spin coating a chlorobenzene solution of 20 mg mL−1 PCBM at 2000 rpm for 40 s. The devices were completed by thermally depositing LiF (0.5 nm thick) and Al (100 nm thick) in a vacuum of <1 × 10−6 Torr. Each device has an active area of 0.11 cm2. The PSCs were encapsulated with a UV-curable epoxy and cover glass slides in a glovebox.
The current–voltage characteristics of the PSCs were tested in air with a computer-programmed Keithley 2400 source/meter and a Newport's Oriel class A solar simulator, which simulated the AM1.5 sunlight with an energy density of 100 mW cm−2 and was certified to the JIS C 8912 standard. The initial scan was from −0.2 to 1.2 V. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of PSCs were measured with a 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel 6258) and a Cornerstone 260 Oriel 74125 monochromator.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were acquired using a Bruker D8 Advance XRD Instrument. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with a Zeiss Supra-40 SEM. The film thicknesses were determined using a surface profilometer (KLATencor, Alpha-Step IQ). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectra were collected with a diode laser (NanoLED) as the excitation source. The repetition rate was 10 MHz, the wavelength was 438 nm, and the pulse duration was ∼260 ps. The scattering of the excitation light was eliminated by using two 600 nm long pass filters. Photoluminescence spectra were acquired using an avalanche photon diode (Micro photon device, PicoQuant) attached to a time-correlated single photon counting card (TCSPC PicoHarp 300, PicoQuant). EIS spectra were measured using an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat and the Nova 1.6 software package. EIS experiments were performed with cells at various different bias voltages (from 0 to 0.6 V) in the dark. A 150 mV rms voltage perturbation was used, and the frequency range was from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz.
