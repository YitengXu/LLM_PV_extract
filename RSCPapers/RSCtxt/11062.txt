    , Accepted 9th July 2019First published on 26th July 2019AbstractHigh short-circuit current (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) are both required for two-dimensional (2D) perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with high power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, solvent engineering is combined with interface engineering to fabricate 2D PVSCs with enhanced Jsc and Voc. Mixing formamide with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was found to promote the formation of high quality 2D perovskite films with large oriented grains grown through the whole film, because of the high boiling point and polarity of formamide. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was replaced with PCP-Na as the hole transport layer to improve energy level alignment, which suppressed the energy loss at the interface. The optimized inverted planar PVSCs presented an increased Voc of 1.17 V and Jsc of 16.90 mA cm−2, with a maximum PCE of 15.86%, which is one of the highest PCEs for 2D PVSCs. The unsealed device shows excellent moisture stability, which maintained around 93% of its initial efficiency after 1200 hour exposure to air (Hr = 25 ± 5%). This work provides a potential pathway towards high performance 2D PVSCs.
1. Introduction
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has achieved rapid progress in recent years.1–9 To increase the stability of the light harvesting layer to meet the requirements for future applications, two-dimensional (2D) perovskites have become a growing field of research as they exhibit a greatly enhanced moisture resistance.10–18
In pursuing highly efficient 2D PVSCs, a large number of studies have been focused on improving the charge transport by regulating the crystal orientation in the perovskite film via approaches of hot-casting,5,6 additive assistance,3,15,17,19 or introducing shorter spacer cations,2,20,21 Cs+ cations6 and guanidinium22,23 into 2D perovskites.
Solvent engineering has been proved to be effective in controlling the morphology of perovskite films to achieve high crystallinity, large grain size and small grain boundaries.24–26 Owing to the interaction between polar aprotic solvents and metal ions, an intermediate phase will be formed in the precursor solution at room temperature, which plays a critical role in crystal growth as it retards the perovskite nucleation during the formation of the film.27–30 Seok and co-workers introduced dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into γ-butyrolactone (GBL), proposing that a MAI–PbI2–DMSO intermediate phase was formed during the treatment with the anti-solvent due to a strong interaction between Pb2+ and DMSO.27 Recent investigations on precursor solutions prepared with mixed solvents indicate that the quality of the perovskite film including crystallinity, grain size and crystal orientation can be tuned by careful selection of solvents with suitable vapor pressure, boiling point and their coordination strength.31,32 This solvent engineering approach has previously been utilized to prepare 2D PVSCs, which exhibited an improved short-circuit current (Jsc).33,34 However, for 2D PVSCs, solvent selection is limited to the mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/DMSO.
In the pursuit of 2D PVSCs with high PCE, the main focus has been directed towards improving the Jsc, whereas only little attention has been devoted to increasing the open-circuit voltage (Voc) although it is an indispensable component toward high PCE. It is noticeable that most 2D PVSCs exhibit a Voc of no more than 1.10 V due to a high level of nonradiative recombination.6,17,20 An important factor for increasing the value of Voc is the interface layers as they are critical for charge extraction and influence the interface energy loss. Chen et al. used NiOx as the hole transporting layer (HTL) and ICBA/PC61BM as the composite electron transporting layer (ETL) for BA2MA2Pb3I10 based PVSCs and obtained a Voc and PCE of 1.23 V and 12.07%, respectively.35 Jen et al. passivated the electron traps in the PEA2MA4Pb5I16 perovskite film near the (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)) (PEDOT:PSS) interface by addition of NH4Cl and achieved a Voc of 1.19 with a PCE of 14.1%.4
In this study, solvent engineering and interface engineering are combined for the purpose of increasing the Jsc and Voc, simultaneously. 2D perovskite with the formula of (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 (BA: butylammonium, GA: guanidinium) is selected as a prototype for the reason that GA-containing perovskite exhibits an elongated carrier lifetime.36,37 Solvent engineering is conducted via adding formamide into the precursor solvent, DMF, as both the boiling point and polarity of formamide are higher than those of DMF. For interface engineering, poly[sodium 3,3′-(2-([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-4,4-diyl)bis(propane-1-sulfonate)] (PCP-Na, Fig. S1†) is applied to replace PEDOT:PSS, as PCP-Na possesses a higher work function (−5.22 eV) than PEDOT:PSS (−5.11 eV). A decrease of energy loss at the interface can be expected due to an improved energy level alignment between the HTL and the perovskite layer.38,39
2. Results and discussion
The influence of solvent and interface engineering was investigated through the preparation of three variations of inverted planar PVSCs based on the (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 film. The schematic configuration and energy level alignment of the PVSCs are displayed in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The bandgap of the perovskite layer is calculated from the optical absorption edge (Fig. S2†). The (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 perovskite film is deposited from a precursor solution with a molar ratio of BAI:GAI:MAI:PbI2 = 1.8:0.2:4:5 dissolved in a DMF/formamide mixture (abbreviated as w/ f) or DMF (abbreviated as w/o f) on either PEDOT:PSS or PCP-Na. Firstly, the effect of solvent engineering was studied by investigating the performance of PVSCs based on the (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 film deposited from the precursor solution with or without formamide. The forward–reverse scan J–V curves of the PVSCs are displayed in Fig. 1c. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. It is evident that the addition of formamide into DMF is of great importance for the performance of the prepared devices. The PCE increases by more than 28% from 10.56% (w/o f) to 13.53% (w/ f), with average values of 8.91% and 12.80% (Fig. 1d) respectively, due to an increase in Jsc from 13.23 mA cm−2 to 17.02 mA cm−2 (both values correlate well with the Jcal obtained from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig. 1e). The solvent engineering process appears to have little effect on the hysteresis index (HI), calculated based on a previous report.40 The HI was 4.6% and 4.5% for devices based on DMF without and with formamide, respectively. Devices were held at the maximum power point for 300 s with a stable PCE of 12.86% (w/ f) and 9.70% (w/o f), respectively, as displayed in Fig. S3a.†

The effect of formamide addition on grain sizes and grain boundaries was investigated via SEM images. The top-view SEM images of the (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 films deposited on the PEDOT:PSS substrate with different amounts of formamide addition are shown in Fig. S4.† Combining the corresponding cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. S5†), the perovskite film with 3% formamide addition presents the optimized morphology. So if not specified, our formamide ratio is fixed at 3%. The cross-sectional SEM images of the (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 films deposited from precursor solutions without and with formamide are presented in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The film deposited from DMF is constructed from small crystal grains and obvious grain boundaries along the direction of thickness can be observed (Fig. 2a), which will hinder the charge transport and cause reduction in Jsc and EQE levels observed herein,15–17,41 while the perovskite film from DMF w/ f consists of large grains, grown perpendicular to the substrate through the entire film (Fig. 2b). Few grain boundaries along the direction of film thickness can be detected, which is beneficial for charge transport and extraction, and Jsc should increase consequently. Herein the Jsc increased from 13.23 mA cm−2 to 17.02 mA cm−2.5,6,15,17,33

In order to investigate how the crystal growth orientation has been effected by formamide addition, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns of (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 perovskite films w/o and w/ formamide were recorded (Fig. 3a and b). The Bragg spots for the perovskite film w/o f span a slightly wider polar angle than the film w/ f, indicating that the formamide addition improves the growth orientation of the crystals in the perovskite film. The corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and parameters are presented in Fig. 3d and Table 2. The diffraction peaks at 14.1° and 28.3° can be attributed to the (111) and (202) lattice planes of the perovskite films, respectively.5,11,33 For the film with 3% formamide addition, the intensity enhancement of the (111) and (202) peaks can be detected. FWHM values of (111) and (202) peaks of the perovskite films narrow down from 0.216° and 0.252° (without formamide addition) to 0.209° and 0.221° (with formamide addition), indicating the enlargement of grain size, which is in favor of improving carrier transport and suppressing charge recombination.42,43

The effect on the carrier lifetime of the (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 perovskite films deposited from DMF with and without formamide on quartz substrates was evaluated through time-resolved PL decay spectra (TRPL), as shown in Fig. 4a. The corresponding calculated results are summarized in Table S1.† The TRPL curve was fitted with a bi-exponential decay function, I(t) = A1exp−t/τ1 + A2exp−t/τ2, containing a fast decay and a slow decay process.44 The PL lifetime, calculated by the formula of τave = τ1 × fracτ1 + τ2 × fracτ2, fracτ1 = A1τ1/(A1τ1 + A2τ2), fracτ2 = 1 − fracτ1, is prolonged from 2.20 ns to 6.17 ns because of formamide addition, indicating an improved film quality with fewer trap states for the BA2MA4Pb5I16 film based on the DMF/formamide mixture. Fig. 4b shows that Voc varies logarithmically (ln(I)) as a function of light intensity with a slope of 1.34kT/e, 1.05kT/e for films based on DMF without and with formamide, respectively, indicating a formamide addition induced reduction in monomolecular recombination.45 To further investigate the electron trap-state density of perovskite films with and without formamide addition, the electron-only devices (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PC61BM/BCP/Ag) are fabricated. Corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. S6.† The details about the calculation of trap density are given in the ESI† based on the literature.46–48 When formamide was added, the value of VTFL (0.77 V) is smaller than that of the film without formamide addition (0.88 V), indicating that formamide addition can reduce electron trap-state density. This reduction correlates well with the observations of increased grain size, crystallinity and passivated trap states extracted from the SEM, XRD, GIWAXS and TRPL measurements conducted herein. On the basis of these investigations, it is evident that solvent engineering through the addition of formamide into DMF favors the formation of high quality perovskite films with large well-oriented grains, possibly owing to the interaction between PbI2 and formamide due to the increased polarity of formamide.27,29,49 As a result, the performances of devices based on (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 films (DMF w/ f) are significantly enhanced compared to devices without formamide, because of the dramatically improved charge transport.

(b) Measured Voc plotted against light intensity (dots), together with linear fits (solid lines) to the data of the (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 based PVSCs without and with formamide addition on PEDOTT:PSS substrates. 
Interface engineering was carried out through substitution of the previously applied PEDOT:PSS layer with a PCP-Na layer. Devices based on (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 films deposited from the DMF/formamide mixture exhibit an improved hero PV-characteristic with a Voc of 1.17 V, Jsc of 16.90 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.81 (Fig. 1c, Table 1) resulting in an increase of the PCE to 15.86% (the average value of 40 devices is 15.39 ± 0.26% (Fig. 1d)) under reverse scanning. The efficiency of forward scanning is 15.19% (Voc = 1.16, Jsc = 17.00 mA cm−2, FF = 0.77). This is a significant improvement in overall device efficiency compared with PEDOT:PSS based PVSCs which only exhibited a PCE of 13.53%, mainly due to an increased Voc (1.17 V vs. 1.03 V), whereas only minor changes are detected for Jsc and FF. The hysteresis index also appears to be slightly improved with 4.2% against 4.5% for PEDOT:PSS based devices. The calculated Jcal from the EQE spectrum is 16.98 mA cm−2 (Fig. 1e), consistent with the Jsc of 16.90 mA cm−2 (Fig. 1c, Table 1). The device exhibits a stable photocurrent and PCE during the 300 s scan, stabilizing at a PCE of 15.19% (Fig. S3a†).
To further understand the influence of different HTLs (PEDOT:PSS and PCP-Na) on the performance of the device based on the film deposited from the mixture of DMF and formamide, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy of the (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 films on different HTLs were performed (Fig. S3b and c†). As seen in Fig. S3b,† (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 films on PEDOT:PSS and PCP-Na both have a valence band (VB) positioned at −5.45 eV. The optical bandgaps of the (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 films were both calculated to be 1.61 eV, independent of the HTL (Fig. S3c†). The conduction band (CB) of the (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 film is therefore calculated to be −3.84 eV. The corresponding energy level diagram is presented in Fig. 1b. Energy levels for the remaining layers were obtained from the literature.17,50 A comparison of the HOMO level of PCP-Na (−5.22 eV) and PEDOT:PSS (−5.11 eV) clearly reveals that PCP-Na offers a suitable match for the VB (−5.45 eV) of the (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 films, which results in an enhanced voltage output due to a suppressed nonradiative recombination and reduced energy loss.35
Similar to the film on the PEDOT:PSS substrate, the (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 on the PCP-Na substrate also presents brick-like grains across the thickness of the entire film (Fig. 2c) and smooth surface (Fig. S7†). The sharp and discrete Bragg spots (Fig. 3c), high diffraction intensity and narrow FWHM (Fig. 3d, Table 2) are comparable for films deposited on both interface layers. These results show that high quality (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 films can be deposited on both PCP-Na and PEDOT:PSS substrates, which might be attributed to their similar hydrophilic character, with contact angles of 4.7° and 4.5° (Fig. S8†).
The influence of the different HTLs on the photocarrier dynamics in the perovskite film was studied using steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra. The PL spectra were obtained by illumination of the films from the perovskite side, and the resulting PL spectra can be seen in Fig. 5a. The PL intensity of the emission peak at 743.5 nm for the perovskite film on PCP-Na is reduced compared to the perovskite film on PEDOT:PSS, indicating a higher degree of PL quenching owing to more efficient charge transfer from the perovskite to the HTL. Fig. 5b shows the decay of the transient photovoltage (TPV) of films on the different HTLs, exhibiting a mono-exponential decay. Since the devices were operated under open-circuit voltage conditions, for the TPV measurements, all the separated photocarriers can only recombine via trap states. The carrier lifetime is estimated to be the time at which the intensity becomes 1/e of the initial intensity.51 The carrier lifetimes of PEDOT:PSS and PCP-Na based devices are 24.6 μs and 75.0 μs, respectively. Thus, the longer lifetime of the PCP-Na based device indicates that PCP-Na significantly reduces the surface trap states in the devices. The dark state J–V curves the PVSCs can be seen in Fig. 5c. The dark current density of the device on PCP-Na at −0.1 V bias voltage is 1.41 × 10−5 mA cm−2, almost an order of magnitude lower than that of the device based on PEDOT:PSS (1.05 × 10−4 mA cm−2), implying a reduction in charge carrier recombination, consistent with the steady state PL and TPV results. To further investigate the hole trap-state density of the perovskite on different substrates, the hole-only devices (ITO/HTL/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) are fabricated. Corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. S9.† The details about the calculation of trap density are given in the ESI.†47,48 When PEDOT:PSS was replaced with PCP-Na, the value of VTFL decreases from 1.81 V to 0.71 V, suggesting reduced hole trap-state density. The decrease of the trap density might be attributed to the Na+ doping into the perovskite and the resulting decrease of the iodide Frenkel defect.52

Finally, the stability of the unsealed 2D PVSCs based on (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 films (w/ f) on PCP-Na in an ambient atmosphere with humidities of 25 ± 5% and 55 ± 5% was investigated by using 3D PVSCs on PEDOT:PSS as references. As seen in Fig. 6, the 2D PVSCs retained approximately 93% of their initial efficiency after 1200 hour exposure to air (Hr = 25 ± 5%). In the case of higher humidity (55 ± 5%), the corresponding 2D PVSCs retained 91% of their original PCE after 700 hours of exposure and the efficiency degraded to 82% after 1200 hours, whilst the efficiency of the device based on 3D MAPbI3 decreased to approximately 50% of the initial PCE after 900 hours. Thus, it is evident that the (BA,GA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 based PVSCs with formamide addition on the PCP-Na substrate exhibit a significantly enhanced humidity stability compared to 3D PVSCs. The thermal stability was measured by placing devices on an 85 °C hot plate in a glovebox (Fig. S10a†). The 2D PVSCs show much better thermal stability than 3D PVSCs. 2D PVSCs based on PCP-Na maintain about 90% of their initial efficiency after 192 hours, while the efficiency of 2D PVSC on PEDOT:PSS degrades to less than 30% of the initial efficiency after 96 hour treatment. We also conducted a light stability measurement via illuminating the devices under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) in an air environment (Fig. S10b†), and the degradation of the PCP-Na based device is also slower than that of the PEDOT:PSS based one. Thus, it is evident that the (BA,GA)2(MA)4Pb5I16 based PVSCs with formamide addition on the PCP-Na substrate exhibit a significantly enhanced stability.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated a simultaneous increase of both Voc and Jsc of 2D PVSCs based on the (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 perovskite film through the combination of solvent and interface engineering. Adding formamide with a high boiling point and polarity into the precursor solution promoted the formation of a high quality (BA,GA)2MA4Pb5I16 film with large oriented grains grown through the whole film. The application of PCP-Na as the HTL suppressed the interface energy loss through an improved match in the energy level alignment. The optimized PVSCs with inverted planar structure presented a maximum PCE of 15.86%, with a high Voc of 1.17 V and a Jsc of 16.90 mA cm−2, which is one of the highest PCE for 2D PVSCs ever reported. The unsealed device maintained approximately 93% of its initial efficiency after 1200 hour exposure to air (Hr = 25 ± 5%). This work provides a potential pathway towards 2D PVSCs with high PCE and moisture stability.

The ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in detergent (Hellmanex, 2 vol%), deionized water, acetone, and an isopropanol ultrasonic bath for 15 min, respectively. After that, the substrates were dried in nitrogen flow and cleaned by UV-Ozone treatment for 20 min before use.

The spin-coating process started initially at 1000 rpm for 10 s and then 6000 rpm for 60 s after dropping the heated precursor to the heated PEDOT:PSS/PCP-Na substrates, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. PCBM (5 mg ml−1 in CF) was spin-coated on the perovskite at 2000 rpm for 30 s. BCP (0.5 mg ml−1 in ethyl alcohol) was then spin-coated on PCBM at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by deposition of 100 nm Ag in a vacuum chamber under a high vacuum of 5 × 10−4 Pa.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (UPS) measurements were conducted on an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo) system, and the energy of the incident light energy for UPS measurement was 21.22 eV. The field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) measurements were carried out on a Hitachi S-4800 machine. Crystallographic properties of the perovskite films were investigated using a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation of 0.15406 nm (graphite mono-chromatic) at a scanning rate of 10° min−1. GIWAXS measurements were carried out with a Xeuss 2.0 SAXS/WAXS laboratory beamline using a Cu X-ray source (8.05 keV, 1.54 Å) and a Pilatus3R 300K detector. The incidence angle was 0.3°. The UV-Visible absorption spectra were taken on a UV-2450 UV-Vis Shimadzu Spectrophotometer. The steady-state PL spectra were taken on an FLSP920 from Edinburgh Instruments, using a xenon lamp at an excitation wavelength of 470 nm.
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurement was performed via a solar simulator (SS-F5-3A, Enlitech) along with AM1.5G spectra whose intensity was calibrated using the certified standard silicon solar cell (SRC-2020, Enlitech) at 100 mV cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) data were obtained by using the solar-cell spectral-response measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech). The perovskite solar cells were kept in a humidity-controlled cabinet (Hr = 50 ± 5% and 25 ± 5%, Bossmen, PR1852(A)-SH) for humidity-stability measurement. We performed a heat stability measurement by placing devices on an 85 °C hotplate in a glovebox, and conducted a light stability measurement via illuminating the devices under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) in an air environment without encapsulation, and the temperature was 40 °C.
