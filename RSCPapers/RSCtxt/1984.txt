    , Accepted 7th January 2015First published on 12th January 2015AbstractEndohedral fullerenes offer the possibility of tuning their properties through a choice of the endohedral unit. The Sc3N@C80 fullerene is the most abundant fullerene after C60 and C70. Recently, Sc3N@C80 has been tested for light harvesting properties with encouraging results. In this work, we study the electronic structure of three endohedral fullerene–Zn tetraphenyl porphyrin complexes using density functional theory. The binding between the components in these complexes arises due to van der Waals interaction. A fragment orbital analysis is carried out to examine the interaction between the two components which shows that a small charge transfer occurs in the ground state from the ZnTPP to the fullerenes and that the orientation of the Sc3N plane affects the ground state charge transfer. The charge transfer excited state energies are calculated using our perturbative delta-SCF method. A comparison with earlier calculations shows that the charge transfer excitation energy increases as C60–ZnTPP < C70–ZnTPP < Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP < Y3N@C80–ZnTPP. The orientation of the endohedral unit does not influence the excitation energy in the donor–acceptor complexes.
Introduction
Organic supramolecular donor–acceptor (DA) conjugates often form the basic component in organic solar cells. The supramolecules are synthesized as molecular dyads, triads or even higher complexes. Typically, upon photoexcitation, an electron transfer occurs from a donor to an acceptor molecule. One of the widely used and efficient acceptor molecules is the C60 fullerene or its derivative such as the phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Apart from the fact that C60 accelerates charge separation,1 the advantage of using fullerene is that it has low reorganization energy and three dimensional charge mobility.
In recent years, large endohedral fullerenes encapsulating a small cluster have been studied extensively due to their unique structure and properties.2,3 While a large number of such fullerenes has been synthesized with various endohedral units, the lack of stability and abundance of such cages has somewhat restricted their use as electron acceptors in DA complexes. Various carbon cages with different types of endohedral units have been synthesized.4 One such class of fullerenes comprises carbon cages encapsulating a trimetallic nitride unit. Trimetallic nitride endohedral fullerenes were first discovered by Stevenson et al.5 The metal atoms of the endohedral fullerene are usually from the 3d and 4d transition metals or the lanthanide series. Ross et al.6,7 have recently reported the use of a Lu3N@C80 derivative as an acceptor in an organic photovoltaic cell. The Lu3N@C80–PCBH material was combined with a low-bandgap poly (3-hexyl) thiophene (P3HT) polymer. They reported an increase in the open-circuit voltage compared to a P3HT-PCBM device. This was attributed to the better offset between the LUMOs of the donor and the acceptor, which reduces the loss of energy in the charge transfer process. There are a few more recent reports on photoinduced charge transfer between a donor molecule to an endohedral fullerene. These complexes contain conjugates of endohedral fullerenes with ferrocene, triphenylamine, porphyrin, corrole and tetrafulvalene.8–14 These recent studies have shown that the endohedral fullerenes have superior ability to stabilize the charge separated states to the C60 fullerene. A recent study has shown that a ZnP–paracyclophane–Sc3N@C80 triad has a long-lived charge transfer excited state with a lifetime extending to microseconds.13
In this study, we computationally examine the electronic properties of model Zn tetraphenyl porphyrin–endohedral fullerene co-facial dyads. Although a large number of dyads of C60 and ZnTPP with various linkers have been synthesized, similar experimental studies on M3N@C80–porphyrin or similar donors are scarce.10,11,13 Since several recent experimental studies8–11,13,15 have utilized the C80 based endohedral fullerenes, we carried out a detailed study on the electronic properties and charge transfer excited states of two trimetallic nitride C80 fullerenes containing Sc3N and Y3N units with a donor molecule. Among the endohedral fullerenes, the Sc3N@C80 fullerene is the most abundant. This is noted as the third most abundant fullerene after C60 and C70. In isolation, both the encapsulated molecule Sc3N and the C80 cage are unstable. In the encapsulated form, six electrons are transferred from the Sc3N unit to the outer cage which makes the whole system stable. Various isomers of Sc3N@C80 have been identified where the structure of the outer C80 cage is different.16 The most stable among them is the one with an icosahedral outer C80 cage. In this study we employ an icosahedral C80 (Ih-C80) cage with trimetallic endohedral units. Electrochemical measurements have established that the reduction potential of M3N@C80 (Ih) with M = Sc, Y, Lu is 140–300 mV higher than that of C60 which indicates higher LUMO levels of the endohedral fullerenes compared to that of C60.17–19 As opposed to the electron accepting nature of the C60 fullerene, the Lu3N@C80 fullerene is also found to act as an electron donor in dyads with perylenediimide (PDI).15 The C80 cage is larger than the C60 cage and therefore the interaction between a co-facial planar conjugated system such as ZnTPP and the fullerene will be stronger. We have earlier carried out a similar study on such dyads of C60 and C70 with ZnTPP.20,21 One of our purposes here is to study the changes in the electronic structure and charge transfer excited states of such dyads when the endohedral fullerenes are used as acceptors. Moreover, replacing the Sc3N by Y3N also introduces a larger endohedral cluster inside the C80 cage which is likely to affect the interaction between the two systems both in the ground and the excited states. Thus we have carried out calculations on the ground and excited state properties of two isomers of Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP and on the Y3N@C80–ZnTPP complex. Our calculations show that the orientational effect of the endohedral unit on the CT excited states is very small.
Computational method
The endohedral trimetallic nitride cluster is planar in Sc3N@C80 but in Y3N@C80, the structure of the Y3N shows deformation from the planarity due to the larger size of the Y atoms. The bonding of the endohedral metallofullerene is described as [M3N]+6@[C80]−6 where transfer of six electrons from the endohedral unit to the carbon cage takes place.16 Due to the ionic bonding between the cage and the endohedral unit, the endohedral unit can rotate freely within the cage. Disorder in the positions of the endohedral metal atoms is often observed in the X-ray crystal structures of the endometallofullerenes. Dorn et al.19 have reported five different orientations of the Sc3N cluster in the icosahedral Sc3N@C80. To examine the effects of the orientation of the endohedral, two possible orientations of the endohedral unit are considered in a complex of Sc3N@C80 with ZnTPP: one in which the endohedral unit forms a plane that is parallel to the plane of the porphyrin (1) and another in which the plane of the endohedral unit is perpendicular to that of ZnTPP (2) (cf. Fig. 1). To examine the effect produced on the CT energy by a larger endohedral cluster, we also included another similar complex with Y3N@C80.

The calculations are performed using density functional theory at the all-electron level using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof22 exchange correlation functional. All the calculations reported here were performed using the NRLMOL code. The DFT-D3 parameters are used to account for the van der Waals interaction between the fullerene and porphyrin units.23 We point out that the basis set used in NRLMOL is specially optimized for use with the PBE functional. Moreover, it correctly satisfies the Z10/3 rule for Gaussian basis sets, where Z is the atomic number, so that the basis set superposition errors are minimized.24 This is important as binding in these complexes occurs due to van der Waals interactions. The forces were minimized to 2 × 10−3 a.u.
The charge transfer excited states are obtained by using the perturbative delta-SCF method.25,26 In this method, the orthogonality between the ground state total wavefunction and the excited state total wavefunction, both of which are constructed as single Slater determinants from the Kohn–Sham orbitals, is strictly enforced. The occupied orbitals are relaxed using the first order perturbation method where the perturbation Hamiltonian is the change in the ground state Hamiltonian due to rigid shift of an electron from the hole to the particle orbital. In this method the occupied orbitals are relaxed in the space of unoccupied orbitals. Similarly the hole orbital is also relaxed in the space of occupied orbitals. This constraint enforces the strict orthogonality between the ground and excited state wavefunctions. This method has been used earlier to efficiently describe the charge transfer excited states of several molecular donor–acceptor dyads and triads.20,21,27 Our benchmark calculations on a set of small donor–acceptor molecules have shown that this method in conjunction with the pure GGA functional can yield results of the same quality as the TDDFT method with range-separated functionals. This method is implemented in the NRLMOL code.28–31
Results and discussion
There are a few published experimental reports on donor–acceptor systems containing trimetallic nitride endohedral fullerenes which considered covalently bonded dyads and a triad.10–13 Exohedral functionalization changes the electronic properties of the fullerenes. It is found that the anionic state of an endohedral fullerene and that of a functionalized fullerene differ. Moreover, non-covalently bonded dyads can form in a bilayer type material. In this work, we therefore study van der Waals bonded dyads of ZnTPP and endohedral fullerenes. As mentioned above, we consider two conformers of Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP dyad to examine the effect of the orientation of the endohedral unit on its charge transfer characteristics. We first optimized the individual units of the dyads. The Sc3N@C80 fullerene has a radius of 4.11 Å for the icosahedral cage. The average Sc–N bond length is 2.04 Å. The Y3N@C80 is slightly larger with a radius of 4.13 Å. The C80 cage contains two types of C–C bonds which are called 5:6 and 6:6 bonds. The 5:6 bonds are abutted by a hexagon and a pentagon and the 6:6 bonds are abutted by two hexagons. The average 5:6 and 6:6 bond lengths in the C80 cage of Sc3N@C80 are found to be 1.45 and 1.43 Å whereas in Y3N@C80 they are of same length 1.45 Å. For comparison, the C–C bond length in graphene is 1.43 ± 0.05 Å.32 The optimized structures of the two Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP dyads (1 and 2) and that of Y3N@C80 are shown in Fig. 1. Since we did not find significant effect of the orientation of the endohedral unit on the CT energy of the Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP complexes, for Y3N@C80 we have considered an arbitrary orientation for the plane of the Y3N cluster with respect to the ZnTPP plane. The initial geometries of the complexes were chosen with a porphyrin to fullerene distance of 3.0 Å which is roughly close to the range of graphite interlayer separation given by various exchange–correlation functionals.33 The smallest surface-to-surface distance between the fullerene cage and the ZnTPP is 3.2 Å in the optimized structures of the Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP complexes and to a larger 3.5 Å separation for the Y3N@C80–ZnTPP complex. The energies of the complexes calculated at various separations show a shallow flat potential well.
The optical gap of Sc3N@C80 is experimentally determined to be 1.51 eV.34 It may be mentioned here that an earlier measurement of the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrum by Stevenson et al. showed a much smaller gap of 0.8 eV.5 Our calculated gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in the Sc3N@C80 is 1.44 eV at the PBE level. Our calculated value is close to that obtained earlier by Zhu et al. using pseudopotentials.35 The HOMO to LUMO singlet excitation energy calculated by using the perturbative Δ-SCF method is 1.52 eV. The dipole matrix elements for this transition is small, showing this transition to be a very weak signal in the absorption spectra. In fact the transition dipoles between HOMO and the lowest four LUMO levels show very weak dipole strength. The HOMO of Sc3N@C80 is spread over the C80 cage whereas the LUMO is spread over both the cage and the Sc3N unit.

Fig. 2 shows the total density of states (DOS) for the Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP dyads and also the DOS projected onto the fullerene and the porphyrin components. The HOMO–LUMO gaps of the dyads are smaller compared to that of the endohedral fullerene only. The DOS of the two isomers of Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP show little variation; hence only those of complex 1 and of Y3N@C80 are shown in Fig. 2. In both the complexes the HOMO and HOMO − 1 located on the ZnTPP with the lowest few LUMOs such as LUMO, LUMO + 1, LUMO + 2, LUMO + 3 are located on the fullerene component. The LUMO of the ZnTPP lies above the fullerene LUMO which suggests that the HOMO to LUMO excitation is a charge transfer excitation in these complexes. The transition dipole between these states is nearly zero which makes these transitions dark.
 Fig. 2  The density of states of Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP 1 projected onto the ZnTPP (bottom) and Sc3N@C80 (top) are shown in section (a). The Fermi level is shown as a vertical line. Similar projected DOS is shown in section (b) for the Y3N@C80 complex. 
The complexes studied here are bound through van der Waals interaction only. The binding energy is defined asEBE = Ecomplex − EZnTPP − EM3N@C80.The binding energies were calculated using the DFT-D3 parameters both with zero damping and the Becke–Johnson damping model.23,36 These energies are presented in Table 1. To understand the interaction between the two components, we have carried out an analysis based on the decomposition of the molecular orbitals of the complex onto the two component orbitals. This scheme is based on the fragment orbital charge analysis given by Dapprich and Frenking.37 In this scheme, the molecular orbitals are taken as linear combination of fragment molecular orbitals. The forward and backward charge donations from fragment A to B for the ith orbital are computed as  and  In the above equations, the ϕ's are basis functions located on the two fragments, c's are the expansion coefficients for the Kohn–sham orbitals, and m's are their ocupancies. The total charge donation from the occupied orbitals of ZnTPP to the unoccupied orbitals of the fullerenes, back donation from the fullerene to the ZnTPP, and also the repulsive charge polarization terms for the three complexes are shown in Table 1. The charge donation from the ZnTPP to the fullerenes is higher for the Sc3N@C80 (0.317e) compared to Y3N@C80 (0.204e). The back donation from the fullerenes to the porphyrin is negligible for two complexes where the endohedral unit is perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the ZnTPP. For the complex 1 in which the Sc3N plane is parallel to ZnTPP, the back donation is comparatively larger (0.163e). The charge polarization term indicates the repulsive interaction between the charges of the two components. The negative sign indicates the amount of charge removed from the overlapping of the occupied orbitals of the components. Since the polarization term is also included in all the terms, the back donation term of Y3N@C80 has a small negative contribution. Overall, the charge analysis shows a small charge transfer in the ground state from the ZnTPP to the fullerenes. The charge decomposition analysis shows that the orientation of the Sc3N plane is important for the ground state charge transfer. The orbital decomposition does not show any significant hybridization between the orbitals of the components in forming the complexes. The frontier orbitals of the complexes have more than 90% contribution from the frontier orbitals of either of the components.

The isosurface of the density difference between complex 2 in the ground state and those of the neutral components is shown in Fig. 3. This plot and the fragment charge analysis bring out several aspects in the density distribution. The porphyrin density undergoes large polarization with density accumulation on the surface facing the fullerene. Due to this polarization, the charge donation from the porphyrin to the fullerene is masked in the plot of density difference (Fig. 3). Significant charge redistribution on the fullerene surface around the Sc atom closest to the porphyrin surface also occurs. In an isolated Sc3N@C80, the charge density is higher in the area close to a Sc ion. The overall effect is charge accumulation in the interface close to the fullerene surface. The largest accumulation is seen to occur on top of the Zn ion which is in the +2 charge state. The presence of the Zn results in significant charge redistribution at the interface. There is also charge accumulation, though to a lesser degree, on the fullerene surface close to the phenyl rings. The charge transfer from the porphyrin to the fullerene, and polarization of the porphyrin charge distribution results in a small interfacial dipole in the ground state.

The charge transfer excitation energy for the donor–acceptor complexes can be estimated from Mulliken's formula38 as IP − EA − 1/R within the point charge approximation, where IP and EA are the ionization potential of the donor and electron affinity of the acceptor, respectively. The separation between the particle and hole at R within this model gives an exciton binding energy of −1/R. Since the IP and EA of the components are important in such a reaction, we have calculated the vertical IP and EA of the components in complexes 1 and 2 as well as in isolation. Since the excited states are evaluated at the geometry of the ground state of the complexes, we present only the vertical IP and EA in Table 2. The ionization potential of ZnTPP is reduced in the complex. A similar trend was also observed for the C60/C70–ZnTPP co-facial complexes.20 The calculated electron affinities of Sc3N@C80 and Y3N@C80 at the PBE level, are 2.49 and 2.46 eV, respectively. The LUMOs of these fullerenes are found to be spread over both the cage and the endohedral unit. However, the plot of density difference between the anion and neutral Sc3N@C80 fullerene shows the extra charge in the anionic state to be spread more over the cage rather than the endohedral unit. A density difference plot shows density accumulation on the inside surface of the cage in the region between two Sc atoms. Ioffe et al. have experimentally determined the electron affinity of a set of endohedral fullerenes in the gas-phase by means of the Knudsen cell mass spectrometry ion-molecular equilibria method.39 Thermal ionization in the temperature range of 914–1016 K was used. The electron affinity value of Sc3N@C80 was determined to be 2.81 ± 0.05 eV. We have noted a large variation in the electron affinity of Sc3N@C80 with different DFT functionals. For example, using the TZVP basis as implemented in the ORCA electronic structure code40 we calculated the electronic affinity using various functionals. To examine the role of functionals on the electron affinity same geometry was employed in all calculations. The various functionals predict the electron affinity as 2.0 (B1LYP), 2.14 (B3LYP), 2.23 (PBE0), 2.39 (RPBE), 2.58 (BP86), 2.26 (BLYP); here all values are in eV. These numbers show that use of different functional can result in variation of the electron affinity by as much as 0.6 eV, with a general trend that inclusion of Hartree–Fock exchange leads to a reduction in its value. The local density approximation yields a value of 2.99 eV which is closer to the experimental value.41 As the PBE functional with the NRLMOL basis set accurately predicts the electron affinities of C60 and C70 fullerenes, it seems that the 2.50 eV predicted by the same basis set and exchange–correlation functional is a reasonable estimate. One possible source of discrepancy is that while our calculations are performed at T = 0 K, experimental measurements are performed at high temperature. Moreover, the isomeric composition of the ions in the experiment is also not known. Similar to the findings of Ioffe et al., we have noted that the endohedral unit does not influence the electron affinity in the trimetallic nitride clusters with similar values for Sc3N and Y3N clusters in the C80 cage. They also surmised the extra electron to be located on the cage which is confirmed by our calculations. The quasi-particle gap is calculated from the difference between the vIP and vEA. In all the three systems studied here, the quasi-particle gap is of nearly the same magnitude. From these calculations, the influence of the tri-metallic endohedral units Sc3N and Y3N studied here is negligible on the acceptor properties. For comparison, we also present similar properties calculated for the C60–ZnTPP and C70–ZnTPP dyads.20 The changes in vertical ionization potential and electron affinity of complexes of ZnTPP with C60 and C70 are comparable to those of the three complexes studied here.

In Table 3 we present the excitation energies of several low-lying CT states of the complexes 1, 2, and Y3N@C80–ZnTPP. In both Sc3N@C80 and Y3N@C80, the LUMO is a singlet orbital whereas the next higher unoccupied orbitals have double or near degeneracies. Calculations using our excited state code gives the optical gaps of 1.52 and 1.61 eV for the Sc3N@C80 and Y3N@C80 fullerenes, respectively. This energy corresponds to the HOMO to LUMO transitions in the fullerene which are very weak in intensity. In the complexes with ZnTPP, the HOMO and HOMO − 1 orbitals are localized on ZnTPP and the lowest four unoccupied states located on the fullerene component. We have carried out the calculations of the CT states corresponding to the transitions from HOMO and HOMO − 1 to lowest four LUMOs. The degeneracy of the higher LUMOs are mostly lifted in the complexes with the CT energies differing slightly for the higher unoccupied orbitals. The difference between the CT excited states in the two Sc3N@C80 complexes are small leading to the conclusion that the orientation of the endohedral unit has small influence on the CT excitation. The HOMO, HOMO − 1 and lowest three LUMOs of the complexes 1 and Y3N@C80–ZnTPP are shown in Fig. 4 and 5. These energies are slightly higher than the CT energies of the Sc3N@C80–ZnP dyad measured using cyclic voltammetry by Feng et al.10 The measured energy of the radical ion pair ZnP+–Sc3N@C80− ranged from 1.45 eV in DMF to 1.74 eV in toluene. The difference between our calculated value and the experimental number occurs due to the fact that the experiments were carried out in solution and that there is a linker connecting the endohedral fullerene to the porphyrin. It is known that attachment of a group typically changes the electron affinity of the fullerene often reducing it.42–45 In the earlier studied C60–ZnTPP and C70–ZnTPP complexes similar localization of the HOMO on the porphyrin and LUMO on the fullerene was also noticed.20 We also present the similar HOMO to LUMO CT excitation energies for these complexes in Table 3. A direct comparison shows that the lowest HOMO → LUMO CT transition energy increases as the fullerene size increases following the general trend C60–ZnTPP < C70–ZnTPP < Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP < Y3N@C80–ZnTPP.
Table 3 The lowest four singlet CT excitation energies of the endohedral fullerene-ZnTPP complexes studied here are presented. The energies for the lowest three charge transfer excited states for similar complexes of C60 and C70 with ZnTPP are also reproduced from Ref. 20

The lowest calculated absorption of the ZnTPP chromophore in the Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP complexes occurs at 2.09 eV. Thus transition to the CT state is unlikely to occur in the gas-phase from the lowest ZnTPP excited state. However, the transition to CT state is possible from higher ZnTPP excited states. This situation may change upon functionalization of the endohedral fullerenes. The interfacial dipoles in the ground states of the complexes are on the order of 0.6 D and 0.5 D which increase to nearly 21 D and 23 D in the excited states in the Sc3N@C80 and Y3N@C80 complexes, respectively. Although the electron affinities of the Sc3N@C80 and that of the Y3N@C80 are nearly the same, the CT excitation energies show larger differences. We have calculated the exciton binding energies of the lowest CT excitations in these complexes as the difference between the quasi-particle gap and the CT excitation energy. The exciton binding energies for the HOMO to LUMO transitions in the three complexes are 1.48 eV for complexes 1 and 2 which reduces to 1.34 eV for Y3N@C80–ZnTPP. On the other hand, the exciton binding energies for C60–ZnTPP and C70–ZnTPP complexes are slightly larger at 1.77 eV and 1.56 eV, respectively. Thus, the Y3N@C80–ZnTPP complex has two advantages, although slight, over the Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP complex. The CT energy is higher in this complex and the exciton binding energy is lower. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the endohedral fullerene–ZnTPP complexes over the C60, C70–ZnTPP complexes. This result may be important from a standpoint of photovoltaics applications. The open-circuit voltage in a photovoltaic device depends on the charge transfer excitation energies46 and is a crucial parameter that determines the power conversion efficiency of the device. We emphasize that these results are for the gas-phase. In solution or in the aggregated form the excitation energies are likely to be more stabilized due to polarization effects. Incorporation of these effects, at present, is beyond the scope of the present work. However, from the trends seen from our results, it can be concluded that replacing the C60 by a tri-metallic endohedral fullerene can lead to a higher open circuit voltage in the device.
In summary, we have carried out DFT calculations on the ground and charge transfer excited states of two Sc3N@C80–ZnTPP and a Y3N@C80–ZnTPP complex. We find that the orientation of the endohedral unit, which distinguishes the two Sc3N@C80 complexes studied here does not influence the CT state energies significantly. The CT excitation energies in the co-facial complexes studied here are above 2.0 eV in the gas-phase which are above the ZnTPP lowest singlet excited state. We find that replacing the Sc3N unit by Y3N in the endohedral fullerene forming the acceptor part may result in slight advantages with larger CT excitation energy and lower exciton binding energy. The CT excited state energies of the endohedral fullerene–ZnTPP dyads are larger than the similar excited states of C60–ZnTPP and C70–ZnTPP dyads. These results are obtained in the gas-phase. In a solution or in the aggregated form, the excitation energies may change due to polarization effects.
