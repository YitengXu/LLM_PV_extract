    , Accepted 10th May 2022First published on 10th May 2022AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become promising next generation photovoltaic materials due to their excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) based on the high carrier mobility, large absorption scope, long carrier diffusion and unique structural tunability of the active perovskite layers. At present, it is a priority for PSCs to further improve the PCE and long-term stability. Metal halide perovskites can be regulated to multiple structures and dimensions by rational design of components, such as three-dimensional (3D) and low-dimensional (0–2D) perovskites at the molecular level, which show totally different optoelectronic properties. Combining the low-dimensional perovskites with 3D ones, more stable 2D/3D, 1D/3D, and 0D/3D perovskite heterostructures can be formed. Compared with single component perovskites, hetero-perovskites (HPs) provide a promising chance to obtain efficient PSCs with long-term stability.

1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have attracted extensive attention in the photovoltaic field by virtue of their excellent optical and photoelectric properties, such as good optical response abilities, ultra-long carrier diffusion length, high charge mobility, etc.1–8 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has exceeded 25%, which is close to monocrystalline silicon solar cells.9 MHPs have become particularly eye-catching materials in the field of solar cells, which are expected to become one of the main forces in the future.10–14 PSCs have demonstrated outstanding photovoltaic performance and potential in the practical commercialization; however, they are facing serious problems in long-term stability, mainly due to the intrinsic instability of perovskite absorption layers and unstable factors of other functional layers in PSCs.8,15–18
To improve the stability of perovskites, some strategies have been proposed recently, including molecular engineering,19–22 interfacial modification,23–25 defect passivation,26–29 optimization of transporting layers,30,31 optimization of electrodes,32–34 device encapsulation,35–38 structure optimization,39,40 the fabrication of hetero-perovskites (HPs),41–45etc. For example, Nam et al. proposed the composition engineering of incorporation of FAPbI3 with MAPbBr3 (FA: formamidinium, MA: methanaminium) to inhibit phase transition of FAPbI3 and obviously improve the stability.46 Lu et al. demonstrated that the strategy of interface modification on the perovskite and hole-transporting layer (HTL) by using a para-substituted benzenethiol molecule is beneficial to the fabrication of large-sized PSCs with high PCE and stability.47 Sargent et al. designed a contact passivation method by using a chlorine-capped TiO2 colloidal nanocrystal film, which alleviates interface recombination and improves interface bonding of PSCs.48 Manuel and his co-workers placed a thin imidazolium iodide ionic-liquid as the passivation layer between the perovskites and HTL, which prevents the electron flow from perovskites to the HTL and minimizes carrier recombination losses, thereby improving the lifetime of PSCs.49 Zhao et al. used copper electrodes to fabricate devices with high-performance, and these devices operate stably in the environment for hundreds of hours without encapsulation.50 An encapsulation layer was directly deposited on a PSC by Young et al. for the first time and it relieved degradation of the PCE (from 18.5% to 18.2%), while enhancing the long-term stability. Moreover, the PCE retains 97% after 300 h under conditions of 50 °C and 50% relative humidity (RH), confirming the important function of the encapsulation layer in improving stability of the PSCs.51 Overall, many researchers have tried a lot of strategies to improve the stability of PSCs, and some progress has been achieved.
Thanks to the advantages of combination of two perovskite materials, the construction of hetero-perovskite solar cells (HPSCs) was considered to be one of the most effective strategies to obtain more stable PSCs, which gives PSCs much more potential in large-area fabrication and commercialization.57–60 Recently, low dimensional perovskites (0–2D) serving as the passivated layer were reported to modify the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite light-absorbing layers by building 2D/3D, 1D/3D and 0D/3D HPSCs, which realize the high PCE and excellent stability of PSCs.54,61 For example, Ma et al. for the first time developed a 2D/3D HPSC in 2016 and demonstrated that the fabrication of HPSCs is a reliable method to improve the stability.52 The 2D/3D HPSC can maintain 54% of the original efficiency after 220 h at a high humidity of 63 ± 5% without encapsulation (Fig. 1a). Liu et al. enabled the PCE of 2D/3D HPSCs to reach over 22%, and it retained 90% of its initial PCE after 1000 h (Fig. 1b).53 The 1D/3D HPSCs devices were fabricated by our group and achieved a PCE of 21.19%, while retaining 93% of the original efficiency for 3055 h under conditions of the maximum power point (MPP) (Fig. 1c).54 In addition, a PCE of 14.77% in 0D/3D HPSC has obtained by Yao et al. and 93.9% of original PCE was maintained within 60 days in a N2 atmosphere at RT, while the PCE of the pure 3D PSC degraded dramatically to below 20% after 30 days (Fig. 1d).55 Lately, Sargent et al. further improved the PCE of 2D/3D HPSCs devices to 22% by incorporating phenyl rings as ligands into a 3D lattice to form a stable interface.62 Recently, Zheng et al. used a novel spacer cation named 2-(methylthio)-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole in 2D/3D HPSCs and improved the PCE (21.25%) and stability (2880 h) synchronously (Fig. 1e).56 More reported PCEs and stability of HPSCs are summarized in Table 1.

To sum up, it has been strongly proposed to improve the performance and long-term stability by fabricating HPSCs to deal with the commercialization challenge faced by traditional single-component perovskites. Combining the advantages of low-dimensional and 3D perovskites to construct 2D/3D, 1D/3D, and 0D/3D HPSCs, a series of viable approaches aimed at improving the PCE and stability of PSCs were explored. This review summarizes and discusses the recent reports on the application progress and optimization mechanism of HPSCs to have systematic knowledge and prospects of their development in the photovoltaic field.
2. HPSCs engineering
The single-component 3D perovskites with high PCEs have shown tremendous potential in application and approached a level of commercialization.63–65 However, the large-scale industrial production of PSCs has been limited by lack of the humidity resistance, instability of the perovskite layer, etc.64–68 As discussed earlier, combining the advantages of low-dimensional and 3D perovskites to construct 2D/3D, 1D/3D, and 0D/3D HPSCs was considered as a viable approach to obtain efficient HPSCs with high PCE and excellent stability. Conspicuously, HPSCs present satisfactory advantages: (a) enhancing the humidity stability since the hydrophobic large organic cations insulate erosion of moisture,69 (b) passivating the defects of grain boundaries to promote carrier migration,70 (c) adjusting the orientation of perovskite films to facilitate carrier transmission,71 and (d) promoting carrier separation.72 HPSCs are classified into two types according to the relationship between the low-dimensional perovskite and substrate, one is the parallel structure and the other one is the perpendicular structure. The parallel structure refers to the low-dimensional perovskite layer parallel to the substrate, and the perpendicular structure was defined as the low-dimensional perovskite layer perpendicular to the substrate. Their differences in passivation defects are reflected in the position of defects. The parallel structure mainly passivates defects on the 3D perovskite surface, while the grain boundary defects of 3D films were passivated in the perpendicular structure. In terms of charge separation, compared with the double-layer structure parallel to the substrate, the perpendicular structure increases the carrier migration since the charge can pass through the surface. Moreover, both structures play a significant role in improving stability. Compared to the perpendicular structure, the low-dimensional perovskites with hydrophobic cations on the surface in the parallel structure are more conducive to insulating external water. In addition, more common classifications are used according to the dimension of the perovskite material, such as 2D/3D, 1D/3D, and 0D/3D HPSCs. The detailed description and discussion about different dimensions of HPSCs are summarized as follows:
2.1 2D/3D HPSCs
Compared with 3D perovskites, 2D layered perovskites show better thermal and phase stability, and they are more suitable for photovoltaic applications from stability perspective.73–75 However, the further progress of 2D layered perovskites in the photovoltaic field was severely hindered by the random distribution of multiple quantum wells with different well widths. Therefore, a 2D Ruddlesden–Popper layered perovskite with a high-purity phase and single well width was synthesized by Liang et al.76 The molten salt spacer n-butylamine acetate was introduced in the precursor to form the intermediate phase gel with uniform distribution. Finally, the resultant PSCs achieved a PCE of 16.25% and high stability within 4680 h under conditions of 65 ± 10% humidity and 85 °C. Most significantly, the large organic cations in 2D perovskites served as the insulating separators in the inorganic layers, which suppress the carrier migration in the perovskite absorber layer.77,78 Therefore, the PCEs of 2D PSCs are much lower than that of 3D PSCs so far. Tsai H. et al. overcame the problem of charge transport by making thin films close to single crystal quality.79 The resulting 2D perovskite films obtained a PCE of 12.52% and high environmental stability (Fig. 2a and b). More reports have concentrated on 2D/3D HPSCs because 2D perovskites can serve as the surface passivation agent of the 3D film.80 The surface passivation of 2D perovskites has the following advantages: (a) passivating defects of 3D films (uncoordinated PbI2 and vacancies of organic cations and halogen ions) and improving the quality of the film; (b) preventing ion migration and water erosion of the spacer organic layer; (c) improving the stability of 2D/3D HPSCs due to 2D perovskites having large formation energy; (d) promoting charge transfer/extraction by adjusting distinct energy levels for carrier transport to improve the photovoltaic performance. The 2D perovskite layer after passivation shows a wider band gap and a smaller electric potential. These electronic properties contribute to the electric field distribution in 2D/3D HPs, such as the carrier concentration and lifetime, the position of the conduction band (CB) and the valence band (VB), work function, etc. Additionally, the 2D/3D HPs exhibit different energy levels in the intermediate layer, resulting in a built-in electric field. More importantly, the intermediate layer on the top is compatible with regular-structural PSCs (n–i–p), and the intermediate layer on the bottom can match with invert-structural PSCs (p–i–n).81 Therefore, the fabrication of 2D/3D HPs on the top and bottom is suitable for regular and inverted devices.

In order to form the 2D perovskite layer on the 3D layer for surface passivation, the deposition of cationic solution has been extensively researched in recent years. For example, Paetzold et al. reported a novel hybrid 2D/3D HPSC for passivation of defects and improvement of the film quality. n-butylammonium bromide was coated on the 3D perovskite layer to form a 2D/3D HPSC, and promotes the fast carrier extraction further.82 As a result, they realized the PSCs with a high PCE of 19.8% and satisfactory open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.31 V (Fig. 2c). In addition, BA2PbI4,86 PEA2PbI4,87 (FPEA)2PbI4,88 (A43)2PbI4,89 CA2PbI4,52 (VBA)2PbI4,90 and (5-AVA)2PbI4,91 have been reported in 2D/3D HPSCs (BA: C4H9NH2; PEA: phenylethylammonium; FPEA: C6H4FC2H4NH3+; A43: (CF3)3CO(CH2)3NH3+; CA: cyclopropylammonium iodide; VBA: 4-vinylbenzylammonium; 5-AVA: 5-ammoniumvaleric acid). Remarkably, a 2D/3D HPSC with one-year stability has also been realized by using 2D AVAPbI4 (AVA: HOOC(CH2)4NH3+) (Fig. 2d).83 Chen et al. used the vapor-assisted growth strategy to fabricate 2D/3D HP films with high quality, in which the thickness of 2D layers is uniform and tunable (Fig. 2e).84 And then, Sargent et al. realized a well-ordered 2D structure on the top of the 3D layer by using a ligand 4-vinylbenzylammonium.85 The organic cations were activated under UV light and formed new covalent bonds in 2D perovskites (Fig. 2f). Finally, the long-term stability based on the UV-cross-linked 2D/3D HPSCs devices in air was verified.
In perpendicular stacking HPSCs, introducing low dimensional perovskites at the grain boundary of the 3D films was considered as an effective strategy to achieve the hydrophobic effect on the surface and increase the short circuit current.45,96,97 Recently, the n-butylammonium cation (BA+) was introduced into FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(IyBr1−y)3 by Snaith et al. to obtain 2D/3D HPSCs.61 In this structure, the 2D perovskites inhibit non-radiative recombination because 2D units were interspersed in highly oriented 3D perovskites (Fig. 3a). The HPSCs with the best BA+ content achieved a high PCE of 17.5 ± 1.3%, and it can maintain 80% of the “post-burn-in” efficiency for 1000 h in air, and it can maintain this for nearly 4000 h after encapsulation (Fig. 3b). Wang et al. tailored 2D/3D FA–GBA (GBA: 4-guanidinobutanoic acid) alloyed HP films by solvent engineering in situ. As shown in Fig. 3c, the layered 2D units were inserted vertically at the grain boundaries of the 3D perovskite layer.92

Even in 2D/3D HPs with a perpendicular structure, charge carrier localization and carrier mobility reduction also occur due to the quantum confinement effects of 2D perovskites. Therefore, the 2D/3D HPSCs with a unique nanosheet/nanocrystalline morphology were fabricated by Zhang et al.93 The stability was significantly improved since hydrophobic MA3Bi2I9 was vertically located in the MAPbI3 grains. Moreover, charges were reflected back to the 3D layer when reaching the 2D/3D interface due to the wider bandgap of 2D MA3Bi2I9 (Fig. 3d). The trapping and recombination of charges at the grain boundaries were restrained, and finally the PCE of the 2D/3D HPSCs reached 18.97%. In addition, 2-thiophenylmethylammonium (ThMA) was introduced by Chen et al., and ThMA not only increases the grain size of 3D perovskites but also enhances the hydrophobicity as the spacer cation (Fig. 3e).94 It can also effectively adjust the orientation of crystal growth and passivate trap states, thereby reducing carrier recombination and improving the lifetime. In addition to organic and inorganic hybrid HPSCs, all inorganic 2D/3D HPSCs with the 2D Cs2Pb2Cl2 phase distributed at the grain boundaries of 3D CsPbI3−xBrx has been developed successfully (Fig. 3f).95 Moreover, the existence of CsPbI2Cl2 effectively promoted the carrier transport and induced the 100-orientation of CsPbI2.5Br0.5 crystals further. Yang et al. increased the lifetime of devices by adding PEAI (PEA: phenylethylammonium) to the precursor solution.98 As shown in Fig. 4a, the 2D perovskite formed spontaneously at grain boundaries can not only inhibit the migration of ions, but also protect the 3D perovskite from water, and thus the PCE and stability were significantly improved (Fig. 4b). Li et al. reported that a 2D/3D Pb–Sn HPSC significantly improved the PCE and stability.99 The addition of organic cation FPEA+ (FPEA: 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-ethylammonium) promoted the vertical orientation growth of the film (Fig. 4c) and inhibited phase segregation. Finally, the 2D/3D Pb–Sn HPSC obtained a PCE of 17.51% and great stability (Fig. 4d and e).

Very recently, cutting the dimensionality (n) of 2D perovskites has been reported by Wolf and his coworkers to be critical for achieving effective top contact passivation.100 As shown in Fig. 5a, the 2D perovskite layer with n = 1 was fabricated by thermal annealing (2D-TA), and the 2D perovskite layer with higher-dimensionality (n ≥ 2) was prepared at RT (2D-RT). Fig. 5b presents the cross-sectional SEM view of inverted PSCs. The more efficient charge transfer at this 2D/3D HPSC interface was verified due to the closer energy band level. As a result, the final PCE retained >95% for >1200 h thanks to blocking ion migration, isolating moisture and oxygen, and passivating defect (Fig. 5c). Additionally, the MPP measurements for encapsulated PSCs were performed under 1 sun illumination for >500 h, and ∼95% of the initial PCE confirms that this 2D/3D HPSC can satisfy the standards of critical industrial stability for PV modules (Fig. 5d).

The solution process is considered to be a common method in fabrication of 2D/3D HPSCs with excellent PCE and stability. However, the limitations of large-area film preparation and thermal stability in the solution process hinder the application of 2D/3D HPSCs. Hence, Jang et al. used a solvent-free solid-phase in-plane growth (SIG) method to obtain an intact 2D/3D HP, in which a stable and highly crystalline 2D (BA)2PbI4 film was formed on the top of a 3D (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr3)0.05 film.101 The detailed SIG method is shown in Fig. 6a, and 2D solid-phase layer was pressed on a 3D layer by applying pressure and heat to ensure the intact boundary of both layers (Fig. 6b). The solvent-free SIG process successfully immobilizes the 2D layer entirely on the 3D surface and prevents the formation of unintended phases. Moreover, unlike the traditional solution method, the thickness of the 2D layer can be adjusted through a solvent-free solid-phase in-plane process. The open-circuit voltage of the SIG-processed 2D/3D HPSC is 1.185 V and the certified PCE is up to 24.59% (Fig. 6c). The encapsulated device retained 94% PCE after 1056 h in the damp heat test (85 °C/85% RH) and 98% PCE after 1620 h under full-sun illumination (Fig. 6d).

2.2 1D/3D HPSCs
The 1D perovskites can be reorganized and deformed due to their lower stacking density, making the structure more flexible.106–109 The “chainlike” framework structure of the 1D perovskite skeleton is separated by large organic cations, resulting in large exciton binding energy. The novel 1D perovskites with low exciton binding energy and long carrier lifetime are expected to improve the PCE and stability in the application of PSCs. The unique 1D chain structure perovskite forms an effective charge transmission channel. Similarly, like 2D perovskites, the large organic cations of 1D perovskites have excellent effect in isolation of water and oxygen, which show outstanding inhibition effect on ion migration and advantages in ion transport and stability.110 Therefore, many 1D metal halide perovskites (Fig. 7a–f), such as BDAPbI4,102 TAPbI3,104 PyPbI3,103 (BDA: 1,4-benzene diammonium; TA: thiazole ammonium; Py: pyrrolidinium) etc., have been reported on passivation of defects in crystal boundaries and enhanced stability of PSCs. Ma et al. proposed a new 1D hybrid perovskite BDAPbI4, and confirmed its “isolation effect” as shown in Fig. 8a and b.102 The 3D perovskites are arranged on a family of (200) lattice planes and the edge-sharing [PbI4]2− units in 1D BDAPbI4 are preferentially interfaced with 3D perovskites, displaying linear arrangement and isolating the 3D perovskites. A high PCE of up to 14% was achieved for the 1D/3D BDAPbI4/MAPbI3 HPSCs (Fig. 8c). Gao and his co-workers used the epilayers of wide-band-gap 1D TAPbI3 to improve the environmental stability and maintain high PCE.104 The 1D capping layer passivates 3D perovskite films and promotes better charge transport, while suppressing ion migration and preserving beneficial optical properties (Fig. 8d and e). Finally, the assembled 1D/3D HPSCs not only achieved 19% of the PCE, but also maintained 92% of the initial efficiency for long term stable operation for 1500 h (Fig. 8f). Fan et al. reported 1D/3D HPs materials by introducing 2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine into 3D perovskites,105 which can significantly prolong the decay lifetime and inhibit carrier recombination compared with traditional 3D perovskites. Additionally, the PCE and stability of unencapsulated 1D/3D HPSCs were significantly better than that of pure 3D PSCs. The present studies provide a facile way to fabricate the 1D/3D HPSCs with high PCE and long-term stability.

A strategy to form 1D PyPbI3in situ on the top of 3D MAPbI3 was reported by Pham et al.,103 and the PCE of the device prepared by this method increased to 15.9%, as demonstrated in the cross-sectional SEM image and photovoltaic performance of PSCs in Fig. 9a and b. The device stability was also enhanced due to the moisture resistance of 1D PyPbI3 (Fig. 9c). To improve the carrier transport, Cui and his coworkers for the first time introduced in situ cross-linking propargylammonium and used the cross-linking 1D perovskite in situ constructed on the 3D perovskite.54 The cross-sectional SEM image is displayed in Fig. 9d, and the dense 1D/3D HP layer presents a slippy surface with inconspicuous pinholes or cracks, which is favorable for the carrier transport. In addition to significantly improving the interfacial carrier transport, this HPSC greatly releases the residual tensile strain of 3D films. As a result, the 1D/3D HPSCs achieved 21.19% champion PCE, and maintained 93% of the original PCE for 3055 h under conditions of MPP operation.

2.3 0D/3D HPSCs
0D perovskites with a unique “island” structure have been widely used in photoluminescent devices, which lead to the spatial limitation of photogenerated carriers and greatly improve the radiation recombination.111 Due to excellent thermal stability, all-inorganic 0D perovskites have shown excellent performance in the field of photovoltaic devices.103 In particular, all-inorganic Cs-based halide perovskites have been widely applied in PSCs and LEDs.112–114 For example, better environmental stability was reflected in 0D Cs4PbX6, 1D CsPb2X5 and 3D CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I), which benefits from the absence of organic cations.115 However, all-inorganic perovskite derivatives show special properties in phase stability and phase transition compared with organic–inorganic counterparts, such as the α-CsPbI3 phase with a cubic structure which can spontaneously transform into the non-perovskite δ-CsPbI3 phase at RT due to phase instability.116 Thus, the fabrication of 0D/3D HPs has been performed to address the instability issue thanks to the better stability of 0D Cs4PbX6 under extreme conditions.117 The 0D/3D HPs inherit the charge confinement of 0D perovskites and the excellent optoelectronic properties of 3D ones. More interestingly, the quantum confinement in 0D/3D HPs Cs4PbX6/CsPbX3 promotes the electron–hole overlap and improves the exciton lifetime.118,119

Fig. 10a shows the single crystal structures of CsPbBr3, CsPb2Br5, and Cs4PbBr6. The low-dimensional derivatives (CsPb2Br5 and Cs4PbBr6) were introduced in CsPbBr3 by Tong and his co-workers to construct a gradient bandgap structure, and the detailed device structure is displayed in Fig. 10b.120 As shown in Fig. 10c, the energy alignments of VB and CB between CsPbBr3, CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5 and CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 offer an effective transfer channel and energy barriers, respectively. The maximum of VB elevates gradually with the existence of derivative phases, effectively blocking electrons and improving hole extractions; thus, charge separation was promoted and interface recombination was reduced. Ultimately, the PCE achieved impressive 10.17% in the stable CsPbBr3–CsPbBr3/CsPb2Br5–CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 architecture strategy (Fig. 10d). Bai et al. prepared stable CsPbI3 by forming a 0D/3D HPSCs composed of 0D Cs4PbI6 and 3D CsPbI3. By adjusting the stoichiometry of CsI and PbI, the Cs1+xPbI3+x films were fabricated and the schematic is depicted in Fig. 10e.118 The 0D Cs4PbI6 crystals were formed in situ as a wrapping layer around the 3D CsPbI3 lattice, inhibiting the grain growth and enhancing the phase stability of 3D CsPbI3 as a molecular lock. This HP was proved to achieve a stable all-inorganic PSC with a high PCE of 16.39%, as shown in Fig. 10f. These studies offer a feasible method for developing stable and high-performance all-inorganic PSCs.

Recently, Yao et al. also successfully prepared all-inorganic 0D/3D Cs4Pb(I–Br)6/CsPbI3−xBrx by adjusting the ratio of Cs+/Pb2+ (Fig. 11a), in which electrons and holes were effectively separated into the HTL and electron transport layer (ETL) through vertical superposition of perovskite layers, as depicted in Fig. 11b.55 0D Cs4Pb(I–Br)6 played an important role in adjusting the morphology of the thin film, optimizing 3D orientation growth and reducing the crystal defects, which remarkably improved device performance (Fig. 11c). The large-area PCSs based on the 1.0-CsI film achieved a great PCE of 10.52% due to the better uniformity of films and the excellent reproducibility (Fig. 11d).

2.4 Perspective and outlook
In conclusion, the combination of low-dimension and 3D perovskites to construct HPSCs provides an effective strategy to improve the performance and stability of PSCs. The HPSCs engineering can effectively improve the carrier migration of PSCs because it integrates their respective advantages of low-dimension and 3D perovskites, adjusts band matching between the absorption layer and transport layer, regulates the electron phonon coupling, and improves the environmental stability of the device. The HPSCs engineering greatly improves the possibility of industrial application of PSCs.
At present, the design and synthesis of novel low-dimensional perovskites are one of the key points in the construction of HPSCs. By regulating the structure of low-dimensional perovskites, new low-dimensional perovskites suitable for the HPSCs engineering are designed, and their stability and photoelectrical performance are optimized. At the same time, in addition to the existing HPSCs, more optimized and complex HPSCs should be designed, such as constructing transverse or longitudinal HPs based on different low-dimensional perovskites. Instead of using long chain organic cations to achieve a longitudinal quantum well structure, more efficient separation of carriers was carried out, and then the performance of PSCs or luminous efficiency in LEDs was improved. Therefore, the fabrication method of optimized HPSCs also needs to be explored and developed.
3. Optimization mechanism
A low dimensional perovskite was coated on the surface of a 3D perovskite layer or uniformly dispersed at the 3D perovskite grain boundaries to fabricate the HPs, exhibiting outstanding advantages: (a) stability increment; (b) defect passivation;126 (c) strain compensation; (d) energy-band matching.17 These effects can improve the charge extraction efficiency, broaden the spectral response range of devices, and improve the stability of perovskite materials.127 For example, Li et al. introduced 2-(2-pyridyl)ethylamine (2-PyEA) into a 3D perovskite as a precursor fluid additive and post-treatment modifier, and demonstrated that 2-PyEAI promoted the formation of the 2D@3D/2D perovskite.128 As a result, 2-PyEA achieves dual optimization of grain boundaries and interfaces in the 2D@3D/2D perovskite, and verifies reduction of the defect density, relief of residual stress, arrangement of the level gradient, improvement of charge transfer, and prolongation of the carrier lifetime. Eventually, 23.2% of the PCE and improved stability were obtained.
3.1 Stability increment
Compared with 3D perovskites, low dimensional perovskites with hydrophobic cations have more water barriers and higher humidity stability, but their efficiency is limited by the increase of the band gap and large exciton electron binding energy.129 The formation of stable low-dimensional perovskites on the top of 3D ones could restrain the diffusion of water and oxygen to 3D perovskite.130 In addition, covering the low dimensional perovskite layer on the 3D ones is considered to suppress the volatilization of cations and halides under wet or thermal conditions, so as to retard the nonreversible degradation of 3D perovskites, and finally improve the humidity stability.131
Zeng et al. reported mixed metal Sn–Pb HPs using one-step blade coating and further passivated with PEABr, and remarkably improved the stability of the structure and moisture by using the 2D layer as a protective barrier.132 As can be seen in XRD spectra at 100% RH (Fig. 12a), the original film without PEABr decomposed totally after 14 h, whereas the film passivated with PEABr retained the initial peaks without significant degradation. Moreover, the device with PEABr passivation preserves more than 50% of the original PCE in air, while that of the device without PEABr was down to 25% (Fig. 12b). Mohammed et al. treated the interface of the 2D/3D HPs with the FABr additive and increased the PCE to 21.79% (Fig. 12c).133 Besides, the stability of the 2D/3D HPSCs under conditions of humidity and irradiation was improved significantly by modifications of FABr. Fig. 12d shows the tracking of the PCE on the 3D, control 2D/3D and treated 2D/3D HPSCs at 85% RH at 85 °C, and among them the treated 2D/3D HPSCs present the best stability (80% of the original efficiency). Zheng et al. constructed a novel 2D/3D (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 HPSC by introducing smaller-size NH4+, and 90% of the original PCE (18.25%) was retained under aging conditions of high humidity for 1000 h.134 These studies provide guidance for the development of novel HPSCs in the future and help to introduce more suitable low dimensional perovskites. Zhan et al. explored a 1D/3D HPSC by introducing the benzimidazole cation (Bn+), in which the orientation of the 3D perovskite was adjusted because 1D BnPbI3 was formed and spatially distributed (Fig. 12e).125 As a result, a high PCE of 21.17% (Fig. 12f) and long-term stability (95.3% of the original PCE for 3072 h) were achieved because the ion migration behavior was dramatically suppressed under operational conditions (Fig. 12g).

3.2 Defect passivation and strain compensation
Defects in polycrystalline perovskite films lead to the carrier recombination and ion migration in PSCs devices, and the non-radiative recombination is the main way of charge loss, which largely damaged the final PCE.135,136 Most of the point defects cause shallow level binding and have contribution in non-radiative recombination.137 However, the device performance was affected by these point defects at grain boundaries. Therefore, the PSCs with excellent PCE and stability depend on an effective defect passivation strategy.27
In addition, residual stress in perovskite films is considered to be an important factor affecting carrier migration and device performance.138 The multilayer interfaces of PSCs are affected by tensile or compression strain in the process of thermal annealing due to different thermal expansion coefficients (α). Because the α value of the ETL is an order of magnitude lower than that of the perovskite layer, the thermal induced tensile stress will be generated near the interface of the perovskite film after heating crystallization and cooling to RT. The stress will increase the interface charge recombination, weaken the charge transfer and accelerate the degradation of perovskites, and finally affect device stability.139 Therefore, the stability and service life of PSCs can be significantly improved by releasing the stress of the perovskite layer through fabricating HPSCs.140,141 Scientific and reasonable HPs engineering have a profound impact on the future development and lifetime improvement of perovskite materials.
Li et al. reported a novel method to obtain the inverted PSCs with high PCE by introducing PEABr.142 The mixed 2D/3D HPSCs were formed at the lower interface when PEABr diffused into the 3D perovskite (Fig. 13a), as a result charge recombination was restrained and the trap state density was reduced at the interface. Finally, the PCE was increased to 19.46% and stability was significantly improved due to the bottom-up passivation with PEABr in this mixed 2D/3D HPSCs. Peng et al. explored a strategy of the ion-exchange reaction to obtain the Cs0.15FA0.85PbI3/CsxFA1−xPbI3 HPSC, in which Cs-rich CsxFA1−xPbI3 with the quasi-shell structure was used on the grain surface.146 As a result, the defect density on the grain surface was reduced due to the addition of Cs-rich CsxFA1−xPbI3 and a PCE of 20.7% was achieved, and the device maintains 95% of the original PCE after encapsulation under continuous operation for 1000 h. Lin et al. obtained the 2D/3D HPSCs based on the all-inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite by using BAI treatment in situ (Fig. 13b).143 The 2D capping layer passivates the surface defects, which facilitates the hole extraction at the HTL/perovskite interface. In addition, Cao et al. prepared the 2D/3D HPSCs by inserting the 2D perovskites at the grain boundaries of the 3D ones (Fig. 13c),144 which effectively reduces charge recombination and enhances charge extraction, and the final PCE is up to 22.2%. The defect passivation on the surface with PEABr was also reported to fabricate the mixed Sn–Pb HPSCs.132 As shown in Fig. 13d, the prolonged PL decay time of the film suggests that surface recombination was suppressed, and thus the device performance was enhanced further. Therefore, the VOC of the HPSC was remarkably increased to 0.78 V and a high PCE of over 15% was obtained.

The residual stress in the perovskite film has been reported to improve device performance. Inspired by the modulus of the bone, Wang et al. for the first time compared the elastic modulus of 3D perovskites and low dimensional perovskites. They found that the elastic modulus of human bones is similar to that of 3D perovskites and the elastic modulus of the cartilage is close to that of 2D perovskites.145 They innovatively proposed the “bone-joint” construction to relieve the external stress in the perovskite film, in which the alloying of the A site cation was adopted. The incorporation of organic cations OA+ or PEA+ adjusts the residual stress relaxation of structural subunits and improves the interfacial interaction (Fig. 13e). As a result, this “bone-joint” construction was conducive to lattice reconstruction and lower elastic modulus, thus improving the carrier transport and device performance significantly. Finally, a PCE of 21.48% was realized and good humidity stability was verified. In addition, an innovative technology of the compressively strained PEA2PbI4 layer was proposed by Zhang et al., in which the 2D perovskites were formed due to the diffusion of PEA+.147 This method was confirmed to compensate the tensile strain and stabilize the 2D/3D HPSCs, and provides a high and repeatable PCE of 21.31%.
3.3 Energy-band matching
Structurally, PSCs are composed of multiple functional layers (including the positive electrode layer (PEL), HTL, perovskite absorption layer (PAL), ETL and negative electrode layer (NEL)). The PAL absorbs sunlight and creates charge carriers (holes and electrons), which then flow to the two electrodes to create current in the outer circuit. When electrons and holes pass through various layers, they encounter many interfaces (for example, electrons encounter the PAL/ETL interface, ETL/NEL; holes encounter the PAL/HTL interface and HTL/PEL interface). Whether electrons and holes can pass through these interfaces depends largely on whether the energy levels at the interface are matched.148 The interface energy level matching has a direct impact on the efficiency of carrier collection, and thus affects the final PCE of the PSCs.149,150 Therefore, the interface energy level matching is another key to the success of the PSCs in addition to the material characteristics.
Zhang et al. reported a dimensional multi-gradient HPSC based on CsPbBrI2,151 in which CsPbBrI2 was distributed at the interface of 3D–2D–0D structure bulk-nanosheet-quantum dots (Fig. 14a), thus the energy alignment between the VB and CB of CsPbBrI2 and the hole-extraction layer was optimized. Fig. 14b shows the typical energy level diagram of the 3D–2D–0D HP, and Fig. 14c presents the variation of energy levels and orientation of charge migration at the interface of the gradient HP under illumination. Due to the opposite flow of electrons and holes, Fermi levels are balanced at the same energy level, reaching the lowest CB and the highest VB, respectively. This dimensional gradient HP has the following synergistic advantages: (a) improving the efficiency of hole extraction and conduction, (b) reducing recombination loss in the process of hole transfer, and (c) constructing the built-in electric field. Finally, a high VOC of up to 1.19 V and a record PCE of 12.39% were realized. In 2D/3D HPs using the FABr additive reported by Mohammed et al.,133 the energy band diagram of each function layer is shown in Fig. 14d, which illustrates the transport of photo-producing carriers between the different function layers. Reasonable band energy contest promotes the electron–hole separation in the perovskite layer, and the excellent energy matching at the interface between the different layers facilitates the carrier movement and prevents possible recombination. It is well known that the inadequate charge extraction between perovskites and transporting layers is one of the disadvantages of PSCs. Jeong et al. introduced CHA2PbI4 and CHMA2PbI4 (CHA = cyclohexylammonium, CHMA = cyclohexylmethylammonium) between the HTL and 3D perovskites to fabricate a 2D/3D HPSC.123 The energy level analysis of each layer is shown in Fig. 14e, and the 2D perovskite promotes effective hole extraction and alignment of the energy band. The 2D/3D HPSC formed a type-II heterojunction, and the PCE was improved from 20.41% to 23.91%. They also introduced a 2D perovskite with fluorine-containing organic cations into the 3D ones, and increased the PCE and stability of 2D/3D HPSCs.152 The type-II energy band structure was formed at the interface, which promotes the interfacial hole extraction and transfer to the HTL (Fig. 14f). The 2D perovskite layer can reduce the defect density, improve interface contact, and increase hole transport by providing a gradient energy-level alignment.

3.4 Perspective and outlook
The research studies on the optimization mechanism of HP engineering provide systematic theoretical support for the development of high performance and stable PSCs. When low dimensional perovskites were used as the moisture passivation barrier and interface encapsulation layer of PSCs, the degradation of perovskites can be effectively prevented, so as to improve the stability of PSCs. Low dimensional perovskites can serve as the interface modification material of PSCs; thus, the crystallinity of perovskites was improved and the surface defects were reduced, and the composite loss of carriers at the interface can be effectively reduced. In addition, scientific and reasonable HPs engineering have decreased the residual stress in perovskite films by strain compensation, and have enhanced the stability and service life of PSCs. Moreover, low dimensional perovskites can be used as the charge transfer layer of PSCs, and it is conducive to efficient extraction of holes and electrons by adjusting the energy-band match. When the low dimensional perovskite with narrow band gap forms HPs, the spectral response of HPSCs can be widened and the light absorption efficiency of PSCs can be improved. In conclusion, the HPs engineering of low dimensional and 3D perovskites provides a feasible way to obtain low-cost PSCs with high performance and stability.
A comprehensive understanding of the basic photoelectric physical properties of HPs is of great significance to guide the material synthesis and process design in the future. For example, carrier dynamics involving charge transfer and exciton properties still needs to be further studied. The summary of the optimization mechanism of HPSCs undoubtedly provides a foundation for the preparation and development of HPs engineering in the future. However, most researchers focus more on the single optimization mechanism recently, while the combination of multiple optimization mechanisms is seldom considered. Researchers should combine multiple optimization mechanisms when designing and preparing PSCs to achieve more satisfactory performances.
4. Prospects and challenges
4.1 Mechanism
In the type-I HPs, the electrons and holes move in the same direction and enhance exciton radiation recombination, which is beneficial for applications in LEDs and lasers. As for the type-II HP, the electrons and holes move in the opposite directions, leading to effective charge separation, which has potential applications in light capture devices, such as photodetectors and PSCs. In summary, HPs provide an opportunity for fabricating efficient and stable PSCs and a feasible way to realize the final commercialization of this industry. It also provides useful reference to further explore their photoelectric applications in other fields, such as LEDs, lasers and photodetectors, etc. Compared with single-component perovskites, HPs with variable structures and adjustable performance provide a feasible strategy for the next generation PSCs. However, HPSCs still face some challenges and limitations.
4.2 Preparation strategies
The spin coating or post-treatment methods were used in the preparation of HPs reported in recent years. It is difficult to fabricate large-scale PSCs with these methods due to their complicated technology and operation, which limit the application of HPs in optoelectronic devices. Therefore, it is significant to develop preparation methods that can achieve large-scale synthesis and application of HPSCs. The methods of well-controlled patterns and continuous growth techniques to manufacture high-quality multilayer complex HPs will become the focus of attention. For example, the thermal evaporation method presents advantages of multilayer perovskite deposition. The solution-based processing method takes advantages of adjustable parameters, high material utilization and in situ crystallization. The blade coating method is widely recognized to prepare large-area thin films. In addition, the epitaxial growth of single crystal perovskite films is still a pressing issue, especially in device application. In the near future, large-area and controllable thickness of single crystal perovskite films can be realized through the improvement of the growth strategy and the selection of alternative raw materials. These methods are extremely beneficial for commercialization of HPSCs and facilitate the transition of technology from the laboratory to the market.
4.3 Stability
Additionally, the stability of HPSCs is not satisfactory, and the HPSCs performance will be significantly reduced once the HPs are destroyed. Structurally, perovskite materials are inherently unstable, and abundant structural defects will occur under the influence of the electric field, temperature, water, oxygen, light, inducing structural changes and even decomposition of perovskites under working conditions. The ions escaping from decomposition will enter the charge transfer layer or electrode layer, further destroying the PCE of the HPSCs, resulting in the significant decrease in the overall performance. Therefore, how to stabilize the structure of HPSCs and protect the separation and extraction process of the photogenerated charge have become an important direction to solve the stability problem.
4.4 Designing novel low-dimensional perovskites
Rationally choosing an appropriate organic cation is the key to construct HPSCs with improved photovoltaic performance because spacing cations greatly affect the band structure and the band matching with 3D perovskites. Additionally, the organic part typically generates the strong quantum/dielectric confinement effect, and large organic cations suppress carrier migration and affect the efficiency further. Therefore, it is necessary to explore appropriately spaced cations with a great balance between hydrophobicity and conductivity to obtain efficient and stable HPSCs. Currently, many organic cations such as BA+, PEA+, CA+, etc., have been proven to be suitable choices. Moreover, more and more organic cations are introduced into low-dimensional perovskites, which not only play an important role in the fabrication of HPSCs, but also promote the development of new low-dimensional perovskites in the field of LEDs.
4.5 Interfacial interaction and transport mechanism
The interfacial electron transport and interfacial interaction mechanisms in HPs have not yet been clearly studied. So far, HPs have been successfully applied in the optoelectronics field. Researchers pay much attention to HPSCs, however, lasers and photodetectors based on HPs have not been widely studied. Although perovskites are demonstrated as outstanding photoelectric functional materials for photodetectors and laser applications due to their large absorption coefficient, high charge carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length, low defect density low recombination rate, etc., most reports focus on single component perovskite and single crystal perovskite materials. Furthermore, the application of perovskites in photodetectors and lasers is lacking in-depth analysis, especially in the related basic electronic properties.
4.6 Lead-free HPSCs
Although the HPSCs have greatly improved stability, the potential toxicity of lead remains unsolved. It is necessary to develop other metal elements to replace lead for the preparation of lead-free HPSCs, such as, Sn, Ge, Bi, etc. which have been proposed as substitutes for Pb, but there are still many obvious problems which need to be solved for lead-free perovskites. For example, the synthetic challenges of fabricating high quality thin films have hindered most lead-free perovskite applications. Therefore, the issue that needs to be resolved is moving towards practical photovoltaic applications of lead-free perovskites, and much work remains to be done to evaluate the potential application of lead-free perovskites.
