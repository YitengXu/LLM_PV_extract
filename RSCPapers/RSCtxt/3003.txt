    , Accepted 20th September 2022First published on 21st September 2022AbstractNovel terpolymers were developed with ester group incorporation (BDT-2EST). DM1 with 5% BDT-2EST possesses suitable crystallinity and miscibility matching with Y6 acceptor to offer an excellent power conversation efficiency up to 17.21%. Moreover, the intertwined random features in DM1 offer robust photovoltaic performances with a broad molecular weight tolerance.
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have seen significant progress with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 19%.1–4 To develop a novel D–A alternating copolymer for high-performance OSCs, various approaches were exploited: (i) optimizing side chains to achieve a nanoscale interpenetrating network with appropriate crystallinity;5,6 (ii) introducing functional groups (i.e., F, Cl, and trialkylsilyl) to modulate optoelectronic properties;7,8 and (iii) enlarging π-conjugated system with fused aromatic rings to enhance electron delocalization.9 Even though those strategies achieved great success, such structural optimization inevitably complicates the synthesis route with uncontrollable yield. In contrast to major structural modification, terpolymerization via combining a third unit within the polymer skeleton has been demonstrated as an efficient and cost-effective tactic.10–14 However, most ternary copolymerizations mainly focus on the introduction of the A unit,15,16 while terpolymers with two D units to construct a D1–A–D1–D2-type polymer have been rarely studied for OSCs.
Introducing an electron-withdrawing substituent into the polymer matrix is an effective strategy to downshift the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level while retaining optical absorption.17 Among various functional groups, F/Cl atoms and ester groups are used to downshift the energy levels for obtaining high open circuit voltage (Voc). Especially, ester groups (EST) have simpler synthesis and are of lower cost.18,19 Several polymers with EST on the main chains show large optical band gap (Eg) and low-lying HOMO levels.20 Inspired by these features, we propose to introduce ester-functionalized benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT-2EST) to PM6via terpolymerization. The two obtained terpolymers, DM1 (BDT-2F:BDT-2EST = 95:5) and DM2 (BDT-2F:BDT-2EST = 90:10), exhibited deeper energy level and higher device performance than PM6. After blending with Y6, the DM1:Y6-based device achieves a superior PCE of 17.21% with Voc of 0.85 V, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.86 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 78.29%, while the PCEs are 16.65% and 15.67% for DM2:Y6- and PM6:Y6-based devices, respectively. The enhanced PCE of DM1 is mainly due to the low-lying energy level, nanoscale ordering morphology, and reduced Eloss, leading to a prominent increased Jsc and FF. Moreover, the BDT-2EST-induced nonperiodic sequence distribution in DM1 offers intertwined random features with less photovoltaic performance sensitivity to molecular weight, which provides a new insight for improving OSC efficiency and batch reproducibility.
Three polymer donors (Fig. 1), namely PM6, DM1 (BDT-2F:BDT-2EST = 95:5), and DM2 (BDT-2F:BDT-2EST = 90:10), were synthesized by palladium-catalyzed Stille polymerization in toluene (ESI†). The typical signals of ester group can be observed at 4.32 ppm in 1H NMR analysis (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†). Using element analysis (EA), the O:S ratio was determined at about 2.61:20.55, 2.81:20.45, and 3.04:20.45 for PM6, DM1, and DM2, suggesting that various BDT-2EST ratios were expectedly implanted into PM6. According to gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurement, the number-average molecular weight (Mn) is 20.57 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 3.26 for PM6, the Mn of DM1-based prepolymer is 18.11 kDa with a PDI of 3.07, and the Mn of DM2-based prepolymer is 15.32 kDa with a PDI of 2.14 (Fig. S4–S6, ESI†).

According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations (B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level),21 the calculated HOMOs and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are −2.47 eV and −5.01 eV for PM6, −2.54 eV and −5.16 eV for DM1, and −2.58 eV and −5.17 eV for DM2, respectively (Fig. S7 and Table S1, ESI†). Significantly downshifted energy levels were ascribed to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of EST, which enlarges ΔE(LUMO(A)–HOMO(D)) and mitigates energy loss to yield an improved Voc value. Besides, for the BDT-2F–BDD dimer, the dihedral angle (θ) is 0.57° between BDT-2F and BDD units, while for the BDT-2EST–BDT-2F dimer, θ is 7.36° between BDT-2EST and BDD. Whereas for the BDT-2EST–BDT-2F–BDD–BDT-2F moiety, θ is 8.62° between BDT-2F and BDD, and 3.28° between BDT-2EST and BDT-2F. The enhanced planarity is ascribed to the enhanced intermolecular interaction. Furthermore, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels estimated via CV measurement are −3.34 eV and −5.46 eV for PM6, −3.36 eV and −5.55 eV for DM1, and −3.40 eV and −5.56 eV for DM2, respectively, consistent with the DFT results (Fig. S8 and Table S1, ESI†).

Fig. 2a shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of PM6, DM1, and DM2 in films. Due to enhanced intermolecular interaction with increasing BDT-2EST proportions, the terpolymers exhibit wider absorption range than PM6. The optical band gaps (Eoptg) are 1.79 eV, 1.80 eV, and 1.78 eV for PM6, DM1, and DM2, respectively (Table 1). The onset for Y6 is 931 nm (Fig. S9, ESI†), suggesting complementary absorption with Y6 acceptor. In addition, the absorption coefficients are 5.28 × 104, 5.76 × 104, and 5.43 × 104 cm−1 for MP6, DM1, and DM2, respectively (Fig. S10, ESI†). Thus, DM1 has a wider absorption range and strongest light absorption capacity, which is conducive to harvesting more solar photons to improve Jsc.

The photovoltaic properties of polymer donors were studied in ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al devices (Fig. 2b and Tables S2–S4, ESI†). The device based on PM6:Y6 combination shows a PCE of 15.67%, with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 25.41 mA cm−2, and an FF of 74.30%, which is in agreement with reported results.22 The PCE of the DM2:Y6-based device is 16.65% with Voc of 0.86 V, Jsc of 25.63 mA cm−2, and FF of 75.48%. Note that the DM1:Y6 device offers a record PCE of 17.21% (Voc = 0.85 V, Jsc = 25.86 mA cm−2) with a greatly increased FF of 78.29% (Fig. 2c and Table 2). Besides, the energy loss (Eloss) was estimated via electroluminescence (EL) and highly sensitive external quantum efficiency (sEQE) measurements, Eloss being 0.53 eV, 0.51 eV, and 0.52 eV for PM6:Y6, DM1:Y6, and DM2:Y6, respectively (Fig. S11 and Table S5, ESI†). This result demonstrated that the introduction of the BDT-2EST unit afforded a reduced Eloss to increase the PCEs.

To investigate the molecular weight tolerance of devices, we prepared a series of donor polymers with various Mn. The PCE of PM6 drops dramatically from 15.67% to 14.05% within a narrow range of molecular weights (Mn = 20.57–46.62 kDa). Whereas, DM1 shows less sensitivity to the degree of polymerization with the PCEs remaining between 17.21% and 16.50% regardless of Mn varying from 18.11 to 46.77 kDa (Table S6, ESI†). As PM6 is a D–A alternating polymer, the properties, e.g., solubility, aggregation, and crystallinity, are easily affected by Mn. For the terpolymer donor DM1, the crystallinity is reduced by the third component, leading to device performance of terpolymers with less sensitivity to Mn.23–25 Thus, ternary polymerization is one of the simple and effective strategies to increase the batch stability of polymer donors.
To evaluate the charge recombination mechanism in the devices, we have determined the dependence of Jsc on the light intensity (Plight).26 The estimated α values are 0.959, 0.998, and 0.984 for PM6:Y6-, DM1:Y6-, and DM2:Y6-based OSCs, respectively (Fig. 3a). That α = 0.998 for the DM1:Y6-based device illustrates less bimolecular recombination loss during charge transport, accounting for its higher FF. On the other hand, trap-assisted recombination was investigated by the function Voc ∝ n(kT/q)ln(P) (k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in kelvin, and q is the elementary charge).27 Compared with PM6:Y6- and DM2:Y6-based devices, the DM1:Y6-based cell displays a smaller slope of 1.07 kBT/q, suggesting mostly suppressed trap-assisted recombination (Fig. 3b). Simultaneously minimal bimolecular and trap-assisted carrier recombination in the DM1:Y6-based device account for its superior FF (78.29%).

The photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) were also measured to evaluate the exciton dissociation and diffusion behaviors.28 As shown in Fig. 3c, under short-circuit conditions, the calculated Jph/Jsat values are 0.984, 0.991, and 0.989 for PM6:Y6-, DM1:Y6-, and DM2:Y6-based OSCs. Under the maximum power output condition, the Jph/Jsat values are 0.864, 0.875, and 0.868 for PM6:Y6-, DM1:Y6-, and DM2:Y6-based OSCs. Besides, the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) obtained by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method are 1.52 × 10−4/0.83 × 10−4, 1.64 × 10−4/1.47 × 10−4, and 1.51 × 10−4/1.14 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1 for PM6:Y6, DM1:Y6, and DM2:Y6, respectively (Fig. 3d and Fig. S12, ESI†). All in all, the DM1:Y6-based device exhibits enhanced exciton dissociation possibility together with higher and more balanced charge carrier mobilities, which gives high Jsc and FF in cells.
The root mean square (Rq) values in AFM measurements are 1.05 nm, 1.17 nm, and 0.98 nm for PM6:Y6, DM1:Y6, and DM2:Y6, respectively (Fig. 4). Interpenetrating fibrillar-like domains with appropriate size were observed in DM1:Y6 blend films. The average full widths at half maximum are 4.9, 3.6, and 4.2 nm for PM6:Y6, DM1:Y6, and DM2:Y6, respectively (Fig. S13, ESI†). Additionally the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χdonor–acceptor) was evaluated, where the DM1:Y6 system shows the smallest value of 0.19, suggesting the best compatibility (Fig. 5 and Table S7, ESI†).29 Moreover, all the neat films show preferential π-face-on molecular orientation (Fig. 6). Since BDT-2EST possesses a near-perfect coplanar structure, both DM1 and DM2 show enhanced π–π stacking behavior with dense spacing (Table S8, ESI†). However, compared with the crystal coherence length (CCL010) of PM6 (CCL010 = 39.70 Å) in the OOP direction, DM1 and DM2 show smaller CCL010 values with CCL010 = 32.00 Å for DM1 and CCL010 = 27.70 Å for DM2, mainly due to the lessened ordering packing of skeleton interrupted by the third component BDT-2EST. Upon blending with Y6, the DM1:Y6- and DM2:Y6-based blend films show larger CCL010 (115.4 Å for DM1:Y6 and 113.1 Å for DM2:Y6) with stronger diffraction intensity than PM6:Y6 (CCL is 110.9 Å), suggesting that the crystallinities of blend films based on DM1:Y6 and DM2:Y6 were again enhanced. The improved crystallinity benefits carrier transport to improve FF in OSCs.

In summary, we have developed novel terpolymers by incorporating a third unit, BDT-2EST, into the PM6 skeleton. Due to the high planarity and strong electron-withdrawing nature of the BDT-2EST unit, the resultant terpolymers display enhanced intermolecular interaction and lower energy levels than PM6. In combination with Y6, interpenetrating fibrillar-like domains with suitable size were observed in DM1:Y6 blend films, which benefits the exciton dissociation and charge transport processes and thus offers significantly elevated Jsc of 25.86 mA cm−2 and FF of 78.29%. Moreover, the ordering packing of conjugated backbones of PM6 was markedly interrupted by BDT-2EST addition, leading to DM1 with gently decreased crystallinity and outstanding batch stability. Our findings provide a new insight for improving device efficiency by simultaneously increasing Jsc and FF in OSCs.
