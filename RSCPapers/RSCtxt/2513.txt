Owing to their low cost and high activity, transition metal oxides have attracted much attention as alternative electrocatalysts to replace the currently used noble metal-based catalysts. Anion defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies, interstitials, and anion dopants) can significantly change the electronic structure of oxides or the stability of adsorbed intermediates, thus greatly enhancing the electrocatalytic activities of the oxide surface. Anionic defect engineering represents a potential new direction for rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts. In this review, recent progress in manipulating the anion defects in transition metal oxides for enhancing their activity and stability is summarized and the proposed mechanisms for enhanced performance are discussed in detail.

1. Introduction
1.1 Overview of the OER and ORR in energy devices
Until now and in the foreseeable future, fossil fuels still remain the main energy source for humanity. The overuse of fossil fuels, however, leads to a series of problems, such as global warming attributed to rapidly increasing CO2 concentrations and air pollution caused by improper combustion of these fuels.1–6 The development of renewable (e.g., solar, wind, and geothermal) energy provides alternative energy sources to fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the intermittent nature of these renewable energy sources makes it difficult to integrate the generated electricity with the grid, thus greatly limiting their real application. To resolve these issues, it is crucial to develop high-performance energy conversion systems that can utilize fossil fuels more effectively and cleanly, and energy storage systems that can bridge the gaps between the generation and the use of renewable energy.7–11
Electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices, such as fuel cells, lithium ion batteries, electrolysis cells, and rechargeable metal–air batteries, have attracted great attention owing to their high efficiency, excellent energy and power density, and environmental friendliness.7,12–20 The performance of these devices is determined critically by the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst over several electrode reactions, such as the OER (oxygen evolution reaction), ORR (oxygen reduction reaction), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Developing-high performance catalysts for oxygen reactions (OER and ORR) is among the most intensively investigated areas in the field of electrochemistry. Because of the sluggish reaction kinetics, a large overpotential (Fig. 1a) is often required to sustain a reasonable rate of the electrode reactions. The ORR and OER hence are considered the reactions that severely limit the performance of many energy storage and conversion systems, including electrolysis cells, fuel cells, and rechargeable metal–air batteries (Fig. 1b).21–28 The mechanisms of the ORR and OER are complicated and depend critically on the properties of the catalysts and functioning environments (i.e. acidic or basic electrolyte).13,25,29–33 The detailed discussion of ORR and OER steps can be found in several recent reviews.13,29–31

1.2 Transition metal oxide catalysts for the OER and ORR
The development of high-performance electrocatalysts for the OER or ORR is essential for achieving high-performance energy devices. Currently, the most widely used ORR and OER catalysts are still noble metal based materials, such as RuO2 and IrO2 for the OER, and Pt and PtM (M = Co, Fe, Ni) for the ORR.31,34–36 However, the high prices of noble metals severely hinder the large-scale application of electrochemical energy devices. Owing to their promising catalytic activities and low cost, transition metal oxides have attracted much attention as alternative catalysts for the OER and ORR. The oxide catalysts that have been extensively investigated can be classified into four types according to their crystal structure: rock-salt-type oxides, spinel-type oxides, rutile oxides, and perovskite-based oxides (Fig. 2).
 Fig. 2  Schematic of widely investigated transition metal oxide catalysts for the OER or ORR. 

1.2.1 Rocksalt oxides. 
In metal oxides with a rocksalt structure, the cation and oxygen each form face-centered cubic lattices.37 The most intensively investigated rock-salt-type metal oxide electrocatalysts are metal monoxides, such as CoO,38–40 NiO,41–43 and MnO.44,45 CoO and NiO have been shown to be promising OER catalysts with comparable performance to noble metal catalysts.38,42 Doping rock-salt-type oxides with different transition metal cations is a common strategy to effectively improve their electrocatalytic performance. For example, Ni–Co oxides with a rock-salt structure are reported to present enhanced OER performance compared to those with single cation elements.46


1.2.2 Spinel oxides. 
The general formula of spinel-type oxides can be expressed as A3O4 (A = Co, Mn, etc.) and AB2O4 (A = Ni, Co, Mn, Zn, etc.; B = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, etc.).47–53 In the spinel structure, the smaller A metal cations connect with O2− anions to form A–O tetrahedrons, whereas the larger B metal cations construct B–O octahedrons.19 Representative electrocatalysts with a spinel structure include Co3O4,54–58 Mn3O4,59–61 LiMn2O4,62 NiCo2O4,63 MnCo2O4,64 and CoFe2O4.65 Among these spinel-type catalysts, Co3O4 and Ni-containing cobalt oxides (NiCo2O4) have been subjected to intensive investigation as OER and ORR catalysts, owing to their high catalytic activity.19,54,56,58


1.2.3 Rutile oxides. 
For the catalysts with a rutile structure, the crystal structure consists of two sets of edge-shared [MO6] octahedra along the c-axis, and the transition metal cations occupy the center of the [MO6] octahedron.19,66 The most widely investigated rutile oxides as OER catalysts are MnO2 (ref. 67–69) and Mn2O3.70–73 In particular, β-MnO2 was reported to show very high OER or ORR activity.66


1.2.4 Perovskite-based oxides. 
In the perovskite structure, the A-site cation is an alkaline, rare-earth, or alkaline-earth metal with 12-fold oxygen coordination, and the B-site cation is normally a metal element with six-fold oxygen coordination.66,74 Single perovskite oxides have the general formula of ABO3. Representative catalysts for the OER and ORR with a single perovskite structure include LaFeO3−δ, LaCoO3−δ, CaMnO3, and so on.75–79 Double perovskite oxides such as La2CoMnO6−δ, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ, PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ, and SrCo0.4Fe0.2W0.4O3−δ were also reported to show good OER and ORR performance.79–84 Apart from the composition mentioned above, other types of perovskite-based oxides are also under intensive investigation, such as brownmillerite oxides (Ca2Mn2O5+δ), Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phase (La2NiO4), and quadruple perovskite (CaCu3Fe4O12).85–91 The crystal structures of perovskite-based materials can critically impact the electrocatalytic activities. For instance, the distortion of the [BO6] octahedra was reported to affect the ORR/OER activity.92,93
Although transition metal oxides have been extensively investigated as OER or ORR catalysts, their catalytic performance still needs to be further improved. To rationally design novel oxygen electrocatalysts with high activity and stability, it is essential to understand the correlation between the material properties and the catalytic activity.23,94

1.3 Anion defects in transition metal oxides
Anion defects are generally observed in transition metal oxides, which can critically impact the material properties such as the electronic structure, ionic/electronic conductivities, and magnetic properties.26,95,96Fig. 3 shows representative anion defects that exist in metal oxides, including a surface substitutional impurity atom, single oxygen surface vacancy, single oxygen bulk vacancy, substitutional impurity atom, interstitial impurity atom, and line defect.26,95,97–101 In addition to these defects, there are also other defects such as vacancy clusters and heteroatoms, which are not shown here.

Traditionally, transition metal ions are considered to consist of active sites for catalyzing surface reactions in electrochemical energy devices.97,100,102 Using in situ18O isotope labeling mass spectrometry, Grimaud et al.103 provided direct experimental evidence that the O2 generated during the OER can come from lattice oxygen for several perovskite oxides. More and more studies have shown the critical role of the anion redox process in electrochemical devices.98,103,104 Anionic defect engineering presents a new method to enhance the activity of transition metal oxides.86,105,106
Anion defects such as oxygen vacancies and S/N/P/F dopants have been introduced into transition metal oxides by various techniques, such as thermal annealing, cation doping, and solution processing.107–111 These anion defects were reported to critically influence the electronic structure, transport properties, and absorption and desorption of reactant and reaction intermediates, leading to significantly enhanced OER and ORR performance of many transition metal oxides, such as MnO2,68,97 Co3O4,112,113 Fe2O3,114 CoFe2O4,108 MnCo2O4,115 CaMnO3,86,110 La1−xSrxCoO3−δ,98 and Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3−δ.98,116 Despite many successful examples, it is still a challenge to introduce anion defects controllably, and the mechanisms of how anion defects influence the OER and ORR activity are still not well understood.100,117
In this review, we begin with an introduction to some commonly used transition metal oxide catalysts for the ORR and OER, emphasizing the effects of anion defects on catalytic activities reported in the literature. In Section 2, we review several representative approaches that have been used to generate anion defects in metal oxides. In Section 3, the mechanisms of how anion defects affect OER and ORR activity proposed in the literature are discussed in detail. Finally, we highlight the key conclusions of this review and provide critical insights into the challenges and future directions for the rational design of better oxygen reaction catalysts.
2. Enhancing the activity of oxides by anion defect engineering
There have been many successfully investigations to improve the activity and stability of metal oxides through anionic defect engineering. In this section, we review several representative approaches that have been used to generate anion defects in metal oxides, including thermal treatment, cation doping, anion doping, solution processing, and the utilization of interfacial effects (Fig. 4). The effects of the generated anion defects on OER and ORR activities are also presented in detail.
 Fig. 4  Summary of approaches used to tune the anion defects in transition metal oxides. 
2.1 Thermal treatment
Annealing metal oxides at elevated temperature under a reducing atmosphere is the most widely used approach to engineer oxygen defects in metal oxide catalysts, which have been demonstrated to significantly enhance the OER or ORR activity of several transition metal oxides.
Thermal treatment under mildly reducing conditions can maintain the original crystal structure of the oxides and introduce oxygen vacancies with various densities into the materials. Representative work was carried out by Kim et al.86 who synthesized single-phase Ca2Mn2O5 at 350 °C under 5% H2/Ar for 3 h. The obtained oxygen-deficient perovskite Ca2Mn2O5 had intrinsic molecular-level porosity on the oxygen-deficient sites (Fig. 5a), which could strongly facilitate ion transport for the OER. As shown in Fig. 5b, the onset potential for defective Ca2Mn2O5/C is approximately 1.5 V, which is 0.1 V lower than that for stoichiometric CaMnO3/C (1.6 V). In addition, the OER mass activity of Ca2Mn2O5/C is 4–6 times higher than that of CaMnO3/C at all the applied potentials (Fig. 5c). The enhanced OER performance of Ca2Mn2O5/C could be the result of the unit cell structure favoring the facile transport of OH− ions, electronic configuration of manganese cations (B-sites) with high-spin electron occupying eg orbitals, and easy bonding formation between Mn3+ and OH− through oxygen vacancies.

Lyu et al.118 further introduced oxygen deficiencies into CaMnO3 by both substituting Nb into the Mn site of CaMnO3 (CMNO) and thermally annealing the material under a reducing atmosphere (H2-CMNO). At a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the OER on H2-CMNO was found to proceed with a small overpotential of 0.55 V. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of H2-CMNO was attributed to several factors, including enhanced phase stability, optimal eg filling level, good OH− adsorption ability, and improved electrical conductivity. Du et al.119 also reported enhancement in the ORR and OER activity of CaMnO3 by introducing oxygen defects.
Thermal treatment in certain cases can lead to not only the generation of oxygen vacancies, but also the transformation of the crystal structure and/or exsolution of secondary active phases, which can synthetically improve the activity of metal oxides. Chen et al.116 reported the phase transformation of perovskite Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3−δ (PBM) into layered PrBaMn2O5+δ (H-PBM) by annealing the PBM in H2 at 800 °C for 15 h. Fig. 5d–f show the phase transition of the as-prepared perovskite PBM to layered H-PBM. The H-PBM showed both good ORR and OER activity (Fig. 5 e and f).
Jiang et al.120 synthesized a RuO2/La0.9Fe0.92Ru0.08O3 (LFRO) composite with exsolved Ru nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on the perovskite LFRO matrix by thermally annealing LFRO in 5% H2/Ar. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies suggested that Ru NPs with diameters of 5–10 nm exsolved onto the surface of the host LFRO (Fig. 6a). The thermally treated samples (LFRO-550H-400O) showed a lower overpotential (420 mV) at 10 mA cm−2 than the pristine LFRO (490 mV) (Fig. 6b), implying noticeably higher OER activities of the annealed samples. Utilizing similar thermal annealing approaches, Gao et al.121 synthesized composites consisting of exsolved Pt3Ni NPs and a La0.9Mn0.9Pt0.075Ni0.025O3−δ matrix with enhanced ORR activity. Zhang et al.122 and Sun et al.123 reported the exsolution of Ag NPs from Pr0.475Ba0.475Ag0.05MnO3−δ and La0.95Ag0.05FeO3−δ after thermal annealing, which led to strongly improved ORR performance. Cong et al.124 observed the phase separation of α-Fe2O3 from parent La0.85FeO3−δ after annealing at 600 °C and 900 °C for 2 h in air. The generation of α-Fe2O3 was attributed to the aggregation of oxygen vacancies during thermal annealing. The interaction between LaFeO3−x and α-Fe2O3 led to a structural distortion that provided more active sites for the OER and ORR.

Apart from perovskite oxides, Leng et al.125 demonstrated that annealing Co3O4 in 5% H2/95% N2 and then exposing the samples to air led to an amorphous surface layer consisting of mixed hydrated cobalt hydroxide/carbonate species, which remarkably enhanced the OER activity. The overpotential to attain 10 mA cm−2 decreased from 580 mV for untreated Co3O4 to 490 mV for Co3O4 subjected to H2 annealing. Cheng et al.97 showed that the ORR activity of MnO2 could be improved by generating oxygen vacancies through thermal annealing in Ar.
It is worth noting that, despite all the successful examples introduced above, the presence of excessive oxygen vacancies was also reported to degrade the electrocatalytic activity of metal oxides in some cases. Wu et al.126 showed that the ORR activities of La0.6Ca0.4CoO3−x degraded after annealing under reducing conditions. Zhuang et al.127 reported that Fe1Co1Ox showed the best OER performance (225 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2) with an optimal oxygen vacancy density of 34% after annealing. The further increase in oxygen vacancies led to deterioration effects on OER performance, which were attributed to the impact on the dissociation process of the adsorbed intermediates.
2.2 Cation doping
Replacing cations with dopants with lower valence or dopants that can lower the oxygen vacancy formation energy of materials is another commonly used approach to introduce oxygen vacancies into transition metal oxides.
Strontium is one of the most widely used dopants in perovskite oxides. Mefford et al.98 systematically investigated the OER activity of La1−xSrxCoO3−δ as a function of the Sr doping level. They found that the replacement of La3+ by Sr2+ led to higher oxygen-deficiency-enhanced covalency of the Co–O bond and high OER activity of the materials. The layered ordering of the oxygen vacancies in the LSCO28 and SCO samples was directly visualized using annular bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ABF-STEM) imaging (Fig. 7a). In both structures, the anion-complete (CoO2) and anion-deficient (CoO2−δ) layers could be clearly distinguished, alternating along the c-axis of the tetragonal supercells. The Tafel slopes were found to decrease with Sr content (Fig. 7b), indicating facile surface kinetics for oxygen exchange with increasing Sr dopant level and oxygen vacancy content. As shown in Fig. 7c, for the OER, the specific activity at an overpotential of 400 mV is 28.4 mA cmox−2 for SrCoO2.7, which is ∼6 times more active than LaCoO3.005 and ∼23 times more active than a commercial IrO2 sample. The positive correlation of the OER catalytic activity toward the OER with the oxygen diffusion rate and the vacancy concentration, δ, can be seen more clearly from Fig. 7d. Combining experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, Mefford et al. further proposed that the OER on LSC led to the exchange of lattice oxygen species.

For another Sr-doped perovskite oxide, La1−xSrxFeO3−δ (LSF, x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1), She et al.128 investigated the correlation of OER activity with the Sr dopant contents. LSF-0.8 (x = 0.8) showed the lowest overpotential value of 0.37 mV (at a current density of 10 mA cm−2), which is 50, 100, 110, and 140 mV lower than the values of LSF-0.5, LSF-0.2, SF, and LF, respectively. The high OER activity of LSC-0.8 was attributed to the high surface oxygen vacancy concentrations, high Fe oxidation states, and stable surface compositions.
Apart from simple perovskite oxides, Pramana et al.129 reported better OER performance for a double perovskite oxide GdBa1−xSrxCo2O6−δ (GBSCO) (x = 0, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) with a higher Sr content. Although no significant improvement in the onset potential was observed as more Sr was introduced, a much higher oxygen evolution current density was achieved when GBCO was doped with 40 at% Sr (GB6S4CO). The current density at 1.65 V (η = 420 mV) for GBSCO with 40 at% Sr reached 0.53 mA cm−2, which is ∼2.5 times higher than that of undoped GBCO. XRD measurements together with Rietveld analysis showed that materials with a higher Sr dopant content crystallized with higher symmetry, transforming from orthorhombic Pmmm with doubling in b and c for GBCO and GB9S1CO to the same Pmmm space group with doubling only in c for GB8S2CO and GB7S3CO, and finally to tetragonal P4/mmm for GB6S4CO and GB5S5CO. This transformation was accompanied by oxygen uptake, which lowered the oxygen vacancy content. A combination of a higher oxygen concentration, higher Co oxidation state, and higher carrier bandwidth (which depends on the Co–O–Co buckling angles and Co–O bond lengths) explains the higher electronic conductivity for the Sr-doped GBCO.
In addition to A site cation doping, replacing the B site cation with another transition metal can also change the oxygen vacancy formation energy and the electrocatalytic activity. Kim et al.130 found that the OER and ORR activity of double perovskite oxides NdBa0.75Ca0.25Co2O5+δ (NBCC) can be improved by doping transition-metal oxides (Fe2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+) into the B-sites (Fig. 8b and c). For the OER, the Fe doped NBCC (NBCCFe) achieves the lowest potential value of 1.627 V at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, as compared to 1.652, 1.634, and 1.637 V shown for NBCC, Mn-doped NBCC, and Ni-doped NBCC, respectively. In addition, NBCCFe had the best ORR activity among the NBCC-based catalysts. NBCCFe showed the lowest half-wave potential (0.679 V) at ∼3 mA cm−2 and onset potential (0.786 V) at ∼0.2 mA cm−2 among the NBCC-based catalysts. NBCCFe showed stable and remarkable electrocatalytic activity with a low Rct and high concentration of oxygen vacancies. Another reason for the high OER activity of NBCCFe was attributed to the more optimized transition metal 3d and O 2p band center position.

Zhu et al.131 reported improved ORR and OER activity of La1−xFeO3−δ (LF) perovskites in alkaline solution by introducing A-site cation deficiency (x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1). The enhancement effect is more pronounced for the OER than for the ORR (Fig. 8e and f). As shown in Fig. 8e (LSV curves for the OER on a RDE), the La0.95FeO3−δ catalyst demonstrated a potential of ∼1.64 V (at 10 mA cm−2), which is significantly lower than ∼1.74 V for pristine LaFeO3−δ. In addition, the A-site cation-deficient La1−xFeO3−δ catalysts exhibited higher limiting current density and more positive onset potential than pristine LF, suggesting better ORR activity. The creation of surface oxygen vacancies and the small number of Fe4+ species in the A-site cation-deficient La1−xFeO3−δ perovskites are responsible for the observed enhanced ORR and OER activity. Rincon et al.132 also reported higher OER activity for La-deficient (La, Sr) (Co, Fe)O3, with the activity following the order of La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 > La0.76Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3 > La0.58Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.
Augustyn et al.133 showed that the catalytic activity of Ni-rich layered LiNi1−xMxO2 (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) can be tuned by the Ni content, nature of dopant, lithium content, and degree of cation ordering between Li and Ni/M. Fe-doping in LiNi1−xMxO2 showed the most dramatic improvements in OER activity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicated that when Fe was used as the dopant, it tended to enrich at the surface and may have served as an electrocatalytic site. Transition-metal ions at the surface likely have incomplete oxygen coordination, which can facilitate the adsorption and desorption of intermediates during the OER.
For oxides beyond perovskite-based oxides, Chisaka et al.134 showed that doping Al atoms in HfOx nanoparticles could incorporate oxygen defects into the materials without decreasing the Hf valence. These oxygen defects can further accommodate N doping in the materials, leading to the formation of an N-doped Al1−yHfyOx phase. The ORR current density [−(iO − iN)] increased with increasing δ until it reached 0.2 (Hf1−δAlδOx-C (0 ≤ δ ≤ 0.3)), but decreased as δ increased further to 0.3, suggesting that the Al doping enhanced the ORR activity of HfOx. The N-doping treatment of HfOx by annealing NH3 significantly enhanced the ORR activity. Wang et al.135 demonstrated that Zn-doping in CoOOH could introduce oxygen vacancies into materials, leading to an enhanced OER activity and durability. The overpotential required to attain 10 mA cm−2 for Zn–CoOOH was 270 mV, which was lower than 310 mV for pristine CoOOH. The Tafel slope for Zn–CoOOH was 44 mV dec−1, which was also considerably lower than those of CoOOH (63 mV dec−1) and RuO2 (73 mV dec−1).
2.3 Solution treatment
Solution treatment is another facile method to tune oxygen defects in metal oxides, offering the advantages of simple processing and preserving the microstructure of materials. Xu et al.136 synthesized porous cobalt oxide nanoplates with enriched oxygen vacancies using a ligand-assisted polyol treatment (15 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h). As shown in Fig. 9a and b, the hexagonal structure of the Co(OH)2 platelets was well maintained after the chemical treatment, whereas the interior part became porous, owing to the volume shrinkage caused by the dehydration of Co(OH)2 and phase transition. XRD results showed that the samples were converted into CoOx after treatment, and the crystallinity of the converted phase increased with the reduction time (Fig. 9c). The sample subjected to 4 h reduction treatment (CoOx-4h) showed the highest OER performance, with an onset potential of 1.54 V (vs. RHE) and an overpotential of 306 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 9d). The authors believed that the high OER activity of these CoOx samples was due to the high oxygen vacancy concentration on the sample surfaces, which was estimated to be 13%, 20%, 24%, and 31% for the samples subjected to 15 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h reduction treatment, respectively.

Cai et al.109 introduced oxygen defects into single-crystalline ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets (P0–Co3O4) with O-terminated (111) facets by mild solvothermal reduction using ethylene glycol under alkaline conditions (O–Co3O4), as shown in Fig. 9e. XPS O 1s spectra suggested an enrichment of O vacancies on the surface of such reduced Co3O4 nanosheets (Fig. 9g). In addition, the Co 2p spectrum indicated that the created surface O vacancies were balanced by the conversion of Co(III) to Co(II). The O–Co3O4 catalysts displayed a noticeably lower onset potential for the OER (∼1.45 V vs. RHE) than that of P–Co3O4 (∼1.53 V vs. RHE). DFT, XPS, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) results suggested a higher electron concentration around the metal Co sites after introducing O vacancies, indicating a lower valence state of Co. In addition, the DFT+U suggested that the presence of oxygen vacancy defects on the (111) facets of single-crystalline Co3O4 can strongly facilitate the OER kinetics and improve the electrical conductivity.
Zhuang et al.137 used NaBH4 as a reductant to produce iron-cobalt oxide nanosheets (Fe1Co1-ONP) rich in oxygen vacancies (Fe1Co1-ONS). The excellent OER catalytic activity (overpotential of 308 mV at 10 mV cm−2) of Fe1Co1-ONS could be attributed to its ultrathin nanosheet structure, which could facilitate mass diffusion/transport of OH− ions and provide more active sites for OER catalysis, and oxygen vacancies that could improve electronic conductivity and facilitate the adsorption of H2O onto nearby Co3+ sites. XPS characterization indicated the existence of oxygen vacancies on Fe1Co1-ONS and Fe1Co1-ONP. DFT calculations and experimental results suggested that optimal doping of Fe3+ ions could effectively promote the oxidation of Co3+ to Co4+, leading to a high OER performance.
Sun et al.108 reported that the oxygen vacancies are introduced into amorphous N, P, and F tri-doped CoFe2O4 (NPF–CoFe2O4) using an ionic liquid as a dopant. Simultaneously, ultrafine MoS2 nanoclusters are anchored onto its surface to increase the specific surface area. After the incorporation of the ionic liquid and MoS2, XPS spectra and DFT calculations indicated that abundant oxygen vacancies existed in the MNC catalyst, which could significantly increase the electrical conductivity and accelerate the surface redox kinetics, thus promoting the OER catalytic performance. MoS2/NPF-CoFe2O4 exhibited an extremely low overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm−2, which was lower than that of CoFe2O4 (450 mV), NPF-CoFe2O4 (390 mV), MoS2 (630 mV), MoS2/CoFe2O4 (330 mV), and commercial IrO2 (370 mV) catalysts. In addition, for OER, the MNC hybrid exhibited an overpotential of 350 mV (at 10 mA cm−2) in 0.1 M KOH and 250 mV (at 10 mA cm−2) in 1.0 M KOH. At 10 mA cm−2, the polarization curve for overall water splitting exhibited cell voltages of 1.5 V, which were only 270 mV higher than the theoretical value (1.23 V).
Handoko et al.138 synthesized copper(II) oxide nanostructures via a hydrothermal method and subsequent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment. The obtained catalysts exhibited unusually high and sustainable OER activity, with an OER onset potential of 1.57 V. The current density at 1.75 V for the H2O2-treated CuO nanostructure reached 2.5 mA cm−2. Such high activity was likely due to the higher oxidation state of CuIII on H2O2-treated CuO2, which facilitated the deprotonation of –OOH* to form molecular O2 through electron-withdrawing inductive effects. Lam et al.139 also treated La0.8Sr0.2CoO3−δ (LSC) with a 30 wt% H2O2 aqueous solution and found that the OER activity was strongly enhanced. Such enhancement was attributed to the reaction between LSC and H2O2 and the corresponding formation of an amorphous hydrous oxide on the LSC surface. Although the effects of H2O2 treatment may also induce changes in oxygen defects, the role of oxygen defects was not discussed by Handoko138 and Lam.139
2.4 Anion doping
In addition to cation doping, doping with anions such as N, P, and S has also been explored to improve the activity of metal oxides.
Shen et al.140 doped phosphorus into cation sites to develop a new perovskite family with the formula of La0.8Sr0.2Mn1−xPxO3−δ (x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1). LSMP0.05 exhibited the most positive onset potential (0.93 V) and the most positive half-wave potential (0.69 V). XPS and XAS showed that the average valence of Mn was retained at approximately 3.5, despite the P doping content increasing to 5 at%. The high activity of LSMP0.05 was attributed to the capability to maintain high valence states of Mn and the improved adsorption to the oxygen species after P doping.
Peng et al.110 developed a facile method to synthesize sulfur-doped CaMnO3 (CMO) nanotubes through an electrospinning technique followed by calcination and sulfurization treatment. The CMO and sulfur powder were placed at two separate positions in a porcelain boat with sulfur powder on the upstream side of the quartz tube, and annealed at different temperatures (200, 300, and 400 °C, denoted as CMO/S-200, CMO/S-300, and CMO/S-400, respectively) in a nitrogen atmosphere for 30 min. The elemental mapping analysis of a single nanotube structure in Fig. 10a and b presents the homogeneous dispersion of S, Ca, Mn, and O in the tube structure. As can be seen in Fig. 10c, CMO/S-300 exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR with an onset potential of 0.915 V, a limiting current density of 5.524 mA cm−2, and a half-wave potential of 0.800 V. For the OER, the potentials needed to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 are 1.63, 1.70, 1.75, 1.78, 1.80, and 1.85 V for Ir/C, CMO/S-300, CMO/S-400, CMO/S-200, CMO, and Pt/C, respectively (Fig. 10d). On the basis of DFT calculations and XANES results, the reason for the high ORR and OER performance of sulfur-doped CMO was attributed to the increase in intrinsic electrical conductivity and the presence of oxygen vacancies as catalytically active sites.

KGaA, Weinheim. 
Xiao et al.111 synthesized phosphorous-doped Co3O4 (P–Co3O4) by treating Co3O4 with Ar plasma in the presence of a P precursor (NaH2PO2). The obtained P–Co3O4 showed outstanding OER performance with an overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm−2, which is much lower than 340 mV for pristine Co3O4 and 330 mV for Co3O4 with only oxygen vacancies present (VO–Co3O4). Calculation results showed that the pristine Co3O4 was a semiconductor with a band gap of ∼1.5 eV. Owing to the new electronic states present in the conduction band, VO–Co3O4 and P–Co3O4 showed a much lower band gap of ∼0.8 and ∼0.3 eV, respectively. Therefore, P–Co3O4 can present better electrical conductivity than VO–Co3O4 and P–Co3O4, which would be beneficial for the electron transfer processes in electrochemical reactions.
Kuang et al.141 synthesized sulfur-doped CoO (S–CoO) with different sulfur concentrations by using thioacetamide (TAA) as the sulfur source. In the OER, the S–CoO catalyst afforded a much lower overpotential (0.36 V) to give a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a smaller Tafel slope (48 mV dec−1) in comparison with pure CoO without sulfur doping. DFT calculations indicated that sulfur doping in the CoO system would lead to an increased density of states near the Fermi level and hence a high conductivity, which might be beneficial for the enhancement of OER activity.
Yu et al.142 doped N into Co3O4 nanowires by thermally annealing the pristine nanowire under an NH3 atmosphere at temperatures of 100, 200, 300, and 400 °C (denoted as N1–Co3O4, N2–Co3O4 N3–Co3O4, and N4–Co3O4, respectively). N2–Co3O4 exhibits the largest current densities, and the onset potential of the N2–Co3O4 electrode for the ORR is 0.94 V (vs. RHE), which is more positive than or comparable to other reported Co3O4-based catalysts, such as Co3O4 nano-octahedra/RGO (0.83 V vs. RHE),143 CoOx/C (0.86 V vs. RHE),144 Co/CoO/graphene (0.87 V vs. RHE),145 and N-doped graphene/CoO (0.90 V vs. RHE).146 The results of XPS and DFT calculations revealed that the catalytic activity is promoted by the N dopant through a combined set of factors, including enhanced electronic conductivity, increased O2 adsorption strength, and improved reaction kinetics.
Zhang et al.40 doped B into CoO nanowires by a pyrolysis approach with ammonium tetraborate trihydrate and cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate as precursors. The B-doped CoO attained a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of 280 mV for the OER, which is lower than the 400 mV for CoO. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and XANES confirmed the presence of O vacancies in CoO, which were mainly derived from the disordering of the local structure caused by B doping. DFT calculation results showed that these O vacancies can efficiently lower the reaction barrier for the oxidation of *OOH, which was considered to be the rate-determining step for the OER.
2.5 Energetic particle bombardment
Utilizing the interaction between energetic particles (ions or electrons), plasma treatment and ion bombardment presents an effective way to engineer anion defects in transition metal oxides. These techniques have attracted increasing attention in the field of electrocatalysis owing to their high efficiency.
Xu et al.113 reported the formation of an efficient Co3O4-based OER electrocatalyst by a plasma-engraving strategy. After treatment with Ar-plasma, the Co3O4 nanosheets not only showed an increased surface area, but also had a large number of oxygen vacancies and Co2+ (Fig. 11a). The onset potential for the OER on the Ar-plasma-engraved Co3O4 nanosheets is 1.45 V versus RHE, which is lower than that for pristine Co3O4 nanosheets (1.5 V vs. RHE). Furthermore, to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the pristine Co3O4 nanosheets required a potential of 1.77 V versus RHE, whereas the plasma-engraved Co3O4 nanosheets only needed 1.53 V (Fig. 11b). The authors proposed that the oxygen vacancies on the surface of Co3O4 formed by the plasma engraving may improve the electronic conductivity, create more electrochemically active sites, and thus enhance the OER electrocatalytic activity. Apart from Co3O4, the authors also reported enhanced OER performance for NiO2 subjected to plasma treatment. Such enhancement was also attributed to the presence of surface oxygen vacancies, which improved the electronic conductivity and provided more electrochemically active sites.

Dou et al.112 developed a facile method for the on-site formation of atomic-scale CoOx species by treating ZIF-67 with O2 plasma. After O2 plasma treatment for 1 h, many visible pores appeared on the surface of ZIF-67, and the dodecahedral morphology was partially broken into fragments. XPS, high-angle annular dark-field STEM (HAAD-STEM), and XANES results suggested that the formation of Co–Co bonds is unlikely in CoOx-ZIF samples, which indicated the absence of metallic Co. For the OER, the CoOx-ZIF only required a potential of 1.548 V vs. RHE to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, which was much lower than the 1.63 V for pristine ZIF-67, and was a similar value to that for RuO2.
Gu et al.147 also reported electrodeposition of Co(OH)2 on NF, which was further engraved with air plasma, and in situ electrochemical oxidation of Co3O4@NF during the OER. Co3O4@NF-15 engraved with air plasma exhibited very high OER performance and long-term stability. The Co(OH)2 nanosheets were treated with air plasma (40 W) for different durations (0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, and 20 min) to expose more surface sites by engraving the nanosheet structure. The air plasma-engraving strategy with different times to create more active defects is used to further enhance the catalytic performance. Furthermore, Co3O4@NF-15, which was derived from Co(OH)2@NF processed with plasma for 15 min, exhibited the best OER performance (overpotential of 303 mV at j = 100 mA cm−2). XPS measurements were performed to study the compositional features and valence state of the samples.
Ma et al.105 prepared Co3O4 with oxygen vacancies (denoted as Co3O4−x) by treating hydrothermally synthesized Co3O4 with Ar plasma. For the sample subjected to Ar-plasma treatment, Co 2p XPS results showed that Co3+ was partially reduced to Co2+, and a peak corresponding to surface oxygen defect species appeared in O 1s spectra, indicating the formation of oxygen vacancies. The ratio of plasma induced oxygen vacancies is estimated to be 7.51 at%, based on the Co2+–O/Co3+–O ratio quantified by XPS. XRD results confirmed that the crystal structure of Co3O4−x remained unchanged. Co3O4−x exhibited a 330 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm−2, which was much lower than that for Co3O4 and exhibited excellent OER performance.
Xu et al.106 demonstrated the simultaneous nitrogen doping and etching of Co3O4 nanosheets by N2 plasma treatment (power of 300 W and pressure of 40 Pa) for various durations (0, 60, 120, and 180 s). XPS results showed that the N2 plasma treatment results in N doping and the formation of oxygen vacancies in the Co3O4 nanosheets, which significantly altered their electronic properties and thus the electrocatalytic activity for the OER. In addition, to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the pristine Co3O4 nanosheets required a potential of 1.79 V. In contrast, the N-doped Co3O4 (60 s) nanosheets only need a potential of 1.54 V. Xiao et al.111 synthesized phosphorus-doped Co3O4 (P–Co3O4) by treating Co3O4 with Ar plasma in the presence of a P precursor (NaH2PO2). The obtained P–Co3O4 was shown to be a very efficient electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.
Apart from cobalt oxide, Zhu et al.114 used air plasma treatment to introduce oxygen vacancies into ultrathin α-Fe2O3 nanoflakes, and systematically investigated the effects of oxygen vacancies on the performance for photoelectrochemical oxidation. Combining XPS and Mott–Schottky analysis, they found that the increased density of oxygen vacancies induced by the plasma treatment was responsible for the increase in the carrier density of the photoanode. The photocurrent reached 2.03 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE) under 500 W Xe lamp illumination, which is 12 times higher than that of the as-prepared hematite without plasma treatment. Chen et al.148 demonstrated that breaking the chemical bonds in a perovskite (SrCo0.85Fe0.1P0.05O3−δ) lattice through plasma sputtering led to the formation of amorphous nanofilms and resulted in a substantial increase in OER electrocatalytic activity. At a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the potential was only 1.54 V for the SCFP-NF catalyst.
In addition to plasma treatment, ion beam irradiation is another approach that can be used to generate defects and dope materials.149,150 There have been many successful applications of ion beam irradiation to improve the functionality of carbon materials and transition metal sulfides.96,151–155 For instance, in our previous work,96,152 we used heavy ions (500 eV Ar+ and 500 keV Au) to generate defects in single MoS2 model materials, and investigated the effects of the generated defects on the HER activity of the materials. We found that the defects generated by heavy ion irradiation were dominated by S vacancies, and the generated defects could introduce defect states within the band of MoS2. The irradiated MoS2 presented considerable enhancement in HER activities which were attributed to the modified electronic structure and absorption of hydrogen during the HER. Despite these applications in sulfide and carbon materials, the applications of ion irradiation to modifying the OER and ORR activity of metal oxides are still limited.
2.6 Interfacial engineering
Owing to symmetry breaking, the hetero-interfaces of oxide materials always present different properties from their bulk counterparts.156,157 For instance, in our previous work,158 we found that the oxygen defect concentration near the hetero-interface can be impacted by the presence of neighboring oxides by using a nondestructive approach combining hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) and high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD), pointing out a potential way to modifying local oxygen defects. In this section, we introduce some very recent results regarding utilizing interfacial effects to introduce high oxygen defects and enhance the OER and ORR performance of transition metal oxides.
Wang et al.159 reported a three-dimensional self-supporting metal hydroxide/oxide electrode with abundant oxygen vacancies prepared by electrodepositing CeOx NPs on NiFe-layered double hydroxide nanosheets. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy results showed that there are many more oxygen vacancies in the hetero-structure (NF@NiFe LDH/CeOx) than those in the NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) and CeOx single phase (Fig. 12b). DFT calculations indicated that the presence of oxygen vacancies near the interface was due to positive charge accumulation resulting from the local electron potential difference between the NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) and CeOx. As shown in Fig. 12c, NF@NiFe LDH/CeOx exhibits a very low potential of 1.51 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm−2 for overall water splitting, which is better than that of Pt/C–RuO2 (1.63 V). The authors believed that the high activity of the NF@NiFe LDH/CeOx heterostructure was due to its high free charge carrier concentration, which facilitated the electron/ion transfer, enhanced the mass transport, and increased the electrochemical active sites.

Liu et al.160 studied the coupling effects of strain and oxygen deficiency on the electrocatalytic activity of La0.7Sr0.3CoO3−δ thin films grown on single crystal substrates LaAlO3 (LAO) and SrTiO3 (STO) by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. The La0.7Sr0.3CoO3−δ/LAO film with compressive strain shows higher OER activity than the La0.7Sr0.3CoO3−δ/STO film with tensile strain. In addition, for both La0.7Sr0.3CoO3−δ/STO or La0.7Sr0.3CoO3−δ/LAO, the OER activity is reduced by introducing oxygen vacancies by vacuum annealing. Both experiments and DFT calculations suggested that the LSC/STO has larger oxygen deficiency than the LSC/LAO sample, owing to its smaller oxygen vacancy formation energy. DFT calculation showed that strain-induced excessive oxygen vacancies in LSC/STO increased the eg state occupancy and enlarged the energy gap between O 2p and Co 3d bands, resulting in lower OER activity. Ma et al.115 synthesized mesoporous MnCo2O4 with abundant oxygen defects by using coprecipitated KCl nanocrystals as a template. Two prominent satellite peaks corresponding to Co2+ species in mesoporous MnCo2O4 (m-MnCo2O4) imply a much higher Co2+ concentration in m-MnCo2O4 than in bulk MnCo2O4 (b-MnCo2O4), showing an obvious oxygen deficiency in m-MnCo2O4 (Fig. 12e). The resulting m-MnCo2O4 catalyst exhibits an excellent ORR activity in alkaline solutions, showing much higher activity than bulk MnCo2O4, a more positive onset potential, and a similar current density to that obtained for Pt/C catalysts (Fig. 12f). Such high performance of m-MnCo2O4 was attributed to the high O2 affinity, larger number of exposed catalytic sites, and efficient mass transport in the mesoporous system.
3. Understanding the role of anion defects
As demonstrated in Section 2, anion defects have profound impacts on the electrocatalytic activity and durability of transition metal oxide catalysts. To enhance material performance, the correlation between the anion defects and the electrocatalytic activity should be understood. Nevertheless, it is a well-known challenge to characterize anion defects, making the fundamental understanding of their detailed mechanisms a challenging task. Recent developments in material characterization techniques and advanced theoretical calculation tools make it possible to probe anion defects at a high resolution, and to correlate such information with the catalytic activities. In this section, we first review the techniques that have been applied to probe to the characteristics of anion defects, such as the density, defect structure, and distribution. We then summarize the mechanism proposed in the literature regarding the effects of anion defects on electrocatalytic activities.
3.1 Characterization of anion defects
Detecting the detailed characteristics of anion defects is a well-known challenge. In many cases, anion defects can only be probed indirectly based on defect-induced changes in the physical properties, such as the crystal structure, transition metal valence states, and magnetic properties. Table 1 summarizes the representative techniques that have been used to characterize anion defects, the physical properties detected, and the studies that applied these techniques to understand the role of anion defects.

The creation of anion defects such as oxygen vacancies and anion doping are normally accompanied by structural changes of the materials. Therefore, detecting the defects induced by changes in the crystal structure of metal oxides presents an effective way to indirectly probe the density and distribution of those anion defects. XRD is one of the most accessible methods that probe the structural changes introduced by anion defects. Such structural changes include lattice expansion or contraction, crystal structure transformation and/or exsolution of secondary active phases.86,97,116,129,131,160–163 One representative study using XRD to correlate the changes in lattice parameters (chemical expansion) with the oxygen non-stoichiometry was carried out by Chen et al. on La1−xSrxCoO3−δ (LSC).161 They reported a “universal” function that could describe the correlation between the chemical expansion (the relative changes in lattice parameters) and oxygen vacancy density (Fig. 13a). Such correlation made it possible to quantitatively compare the oxygen defect density among LSC samples subjected to different treatments, as demonstrated in the work of Chen et al.162

Another example of using lattice parameter changes to probe the oxygen defect density was the work of Li et al.,163 who used HRXRD to probe the out-of-plane lattice parameter changes of RP phase Nd2NiO4 thin films introduced by the loss of oxygen after H2 annealing (Fig. 13b). Such changes in the lattice parameter were then correlated with the amount of oxygen lost during thermal treatment. Besides the changes in lattice parameter, using XRD, Chen et al.116 found that Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3−δ (PBM) subjected to H2 annealing exhibited a layered crystal structure (Fig. 5d), which was due to the phase transition from a cubic structure with randomly distributed Pr/Ba sites to an ordered structure after thermal annealing.
TEM and STEM can be used to obtain the local crystal structure and atomic arrangements of materials with atomic resolution. The generated anion defects can be probed through structural distortion or the contrast in the detected images characterized by TEM and STEM.98,112,125,127 Using STEM, Mefford et al.98 provided direct evidence for the formation of oxygen vacancies in SrCoO3−δ. Half of the perovskite (CoO2) layers appear brighter, indicating the presence of oxygen vacancies (marked with white arrowheads in Fig. 7a). Using HRTEM, Zhuang et al.127 observed a disordered structure relative to perfect crystals for Fe1Co1Ox subjected to thermal annealing (Fig. 13c and d), which suggested the creation of oxygen vacancies during hydrogenation. The possible positions of the oxygen vacancies relative to the perfect structure are shown in Fig. 13d. Apart from point defects such as oxygen vacancies, long-range anion defect clusters that induced large-scale changes in the material microstructure can be directly imaged using atomic force microscopy (AFM)127,137 and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).113,147,167
Another method to probe the anion defects is to detect the magnetic property changes of the materials induced by these defects. For instance, by detecting the transitions between quantized states of the resulting magnetic moment, EPR spectroscopy can provide valuable fingerprinting information about the unpaired electrons. The number of such unpaired electrons can be related to the anion defect density for certain complex materials.40,108,159 Using EPR, Sun et al.108 probed the oxygen vacancies in MoS2/NPF-CoFe2O4 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 14a, after the incorporation of an ionic liquid and MoS2, the EPR spectra of the MNC catalyst showed noticeable increases in intensity, indicating abundant oxygen vacancies in the materials.

XPS is a sensitive spectroscopic technique to determine the surface atomic composition and chemical state of the elements. The presence of anion defects can be probed by XPS based on the changes in cation valence states and the chemical environments of oxygen.105,114,129–131,135,137,165 For instance, Ma et al.105 showed that the peak at 531.8 eV is assigned to surface oxygen defect treatment, confirming the generation of oxygen vacancies in Co3O4−x by Ar plasma (Fig. 14b). Furthermore, the changes in cation valence states can also be used to confirm the generation of oxygen vacancies.40,105,109,113,137
Synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS)110–112,119,124,166 and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS)111,112,119,166 provide a sensitive tool to determine the local atomic structures and electronic structures. For instance, Peng110et al. observed that the rising edge of the XANES spectra for sulfur-doped CaMnO3 (CMO/S) nanotubes shifted to lower energy by 0.63 eV after sulfur doping of CMO, indicating the valence-state changes from high-oxidation Mn(IV) to reduced Mn(III) and the formation of many oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, they also found the reduction of oscillation, suggesting different local atomic arrangements of the modified compound (inset in Fig. 14c). Xiao et al.111 also probed the oxygen vacancies in Co3O4 (Vo-Co3O4) and phosphorus doped oxygen vacancies Co3O4 (P–Co3O4) by EXAFS. As shown in Fig. 14d, the first peak originates from two Co–O bonds that consist of an octahedral Co3+–O (O h) shell and a tetrahedral Co2+–O (Td) shell, the second peak is ascribed to the Co–Co bonds for two octahedral Co ions, and the third peak is related to the Co–Co bonds for two tetrahedral Co or tetrahedral and octahedral Co. Significant changes in the Fourier-transform intensities can only be found in the first coordination shell. The relatively lower coordination numbers in the first shell in VO–Co3O4 compared to those in pristine Co3O4 suggested that the oxygen vacancies were created after Ar-plasma etching in the presence of a P precursor (NaH2PO2).
The techniques introduced above are typically implemented at room temperature in a vacuum, which are far from the operating conditions of energy devices. In recent years, significant progress has been made towards advanced material characterization techniques for them to function in different gas/liquid environments and/or with electrical bias. Such capabilities can facilitate the study of how the catalyst evolves under the functioning conditions of energy devices. For instance, Louie et al.168 used in situ Raman spectroscopy to investigate the structural changes and reaction intermediates of electrodeposited Ni–Fe films in alkaline electrolytes during the OER. Raman spectroscopy was performed at a controlled electrochemical potential using a tailored Teflon cell with a 4 mm Au as the working electrode at the bottom of the cell. The obtained in situ Raman data confirmed that the presence of Fe changed the redox properties of Ni, resulting in a positive change in the potential of the Ni(OH)2/NiOOH redox. As a result of such changes, the average oxidation state of Ni is lowered, leading to a considerable increase in OER activity for the Ni–Fe films. Gorlin et al.169 utilized in situ XAS to identify the catalytically active sites in a bifunctional manganese oxide (MnOx) catalyst supported on Au–Si3N4 (MnOx/Au–Si3N4) for the ORR and OER. They found that exposure to an ORR-relevant potential of 0.7 V (vs. RHE) produces a disordered Mn3II,III,IIIO4 phase and the contribution of other phases is small. For the OER, when the potential is increased to a high anodic value of 1.8 V (vs. RHE), they observed that about 80% of the catalytic film oxidized to form mixed MnIII,IV oxides, while the remaining 20% of the film consisted of less oxidized phases. Liu et al.170 demonstrated that the rich dynamics of solvation shells in aqueous solutions could be revealed by combining advanced simulations with in situ ambient pressure XPS (AP-XPS). In aqueous solution, simulation results showed that local structural fluctuations could lead to significant broadening of the XPS peak. Favaro et al.171 directly probed the potential drop within an electrochemical double layer by performing APXPS under polarization conditions. Using in situ18O isotope labeling mass spectrometry, Grimaud et al.103 showed that the O2 produced on some highly active oxides during the OER may be derived from lattice oxygen. Using a combination of in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) and ex situ cyclic voltammetry measurement, Raabe et al.172 uncovered the effects of Pr doping on the OER activity of CaMnO3.
3.2 Effect of anion defects on electrocatalytic activity
The presence of anion defects can critically modify the bulk material properties and the interaction processes of the catalysts with the reactants. The mechanisms of how anion defects affect the OER and ORR activity proposed in the literature can be categorized into four major aspects: modifying the bulk electronic structure, changing transport properties, the formation of secondary surface active phases, and impacting the absorption and desorption of reactants and reaction intermediates on the surfaces (Fig. 15). In this section, we discuss the effects of anion defects with respect to these four aspects. It should be noted that the effects shown in Fig. 15 are not independent of each other. For instance, the changes in the bulk electronic structure directly impact the electronic and ionic transport properties of materials, as well as the binding energy of the surface to the reaction intermediates.

3.2.1 Modifying the bulk electronic structure. 
The crucial role of the electronic structure in determining the electrocatalytic reactivity has been well recognized in the field of catalysis.173–176 To predict the catalytic activity of a new material based on the understanding of its electronic structure, there have been a large number of efforts towards identifying a parameter related to the electronic structure as an “activity descriptor,” which directly determines the rate of the rate-limiting reaction steps.104,177–179 Many of the discussions in the literature about the effect of anion defects were carried out on the basis of changes in electronic structure descriptors.
The energy distance between metal 3d (M 3d) and O 2p is one activity descriptor that can be correlated with the OER or ORR activity of transition metal oxides.98,103,141 A smaller energy gap between the M 3d and O 2p band centers of the transition metal oxide catalyst can lead to a stronger covalent bond and reduced charge transfer barrier between the metal and oxygen, which is likely to result in higher OER or ORR catalytic performance.
The position of the O 2p band center with respect to the Fermi energy is also an important characteristic that can be used predict the OER and ORR performance. A higher O 2p band center relative to the Fermi level corresponded to a smaller energy penalty to form oxygen vacancies and higher oxygen–metal bond covalency, which were believed to be beneficial for the OER and ORR to occur. The lattice oxygen in perovskites was reported to be thermodynamically favorable when the O 2p band center at the perovskite Fermi level was above the redox energy of the O2/H2O couple, as shown in Fig. 16b.98,103 The work of Grimaud et al.103 provided a good confirmation of this view. DFT calculations showed that substituting trivalent ions such as La3+ with divalent ions such as Sr2+ on the A-site of the perovskite structure was accompanied by a reduced energy gap between the metal 3d and O 2p-band centers; the catalytic activity for the OER and ORR is also related to the relative positions of the Fermi level and O 2p.

All rights reserved. 
The band gap is also one of the important theoretical parameters for measuring catalytic activity. The smaller the band gap, the better the electron transfer in the electrochemical process, which thereby increases the OER or ORR catalytic activity of transition metal oxides.109–111,119,142 For instance, Peng et al.110 developed a facile method to synthesize sulfur-doped CMO nanotubes through an electrospinning technique followed by calcination and sulfurization treatment. It was theoretically confirmed that the excellent ORR activity of sulfur-doped CMO is due to the reduction in the band gap (Fig. 16c).
In addition, eg filling is another electronic structure descriptor that has been used evaluate the OER or ORR activity of transition metal oxides. It has been reported that perovskite oxides with an eg filling close to 1 show the highest ORR or OER activities in alkaline solutions.86,131,135,180 Wang et al.135 demonstrated that Zn doping in CoOOH could introduce oxygen vacancies into the materials and change the Jahn–Teller distortion of the lattice, which would lead to a more optimized eg state filling and enhanced OER activity and durability (Fig. 16d).


3.2.2 Changing transport properties. 
The presence of anion defects such as oxygen vacancies or anion doping in many cases was believed to enhance the electronic conductivity of transition metal oxides, thereby enhancing the OER or ORR activity of the oxides.119,120,129,130 For instance, Lyu et al.118 introduced oxygen deficiency into CaMnO3 by both substituting Nb into the Mn site of CMO and thermally annealing it in hydrogen gas. The reduced CMNO exhibits good OER catalytic activity, which was attributed to the substantial increase in conductivity. The electrical conductivity of H2-CMNO was quantified to be 2.19 × 10−2 S m−1, which was 10 times higher than that of CMO (3.33 × 10−3 S m−1). In particular, when doping with a nonmetallic material (such as S, N, or P), the conductivity of the catalyst is further improved owing to the more negative electronegativity of the incorporated nonmetallic element.108,110,111,141
Kuang et al.141 synthesized sulfur-doped CoO (S–CoO) with different sulfur concentrations by using TAA as the sulfur source. DFT calculations indicated that sulfur doping in the CoO system would lead to increased conductivity of sulfur-doped CoO (S–CoO), which might be beneficial for the enhancement of OER activity. Xiao et al.111 synthesized phosphorous-doped Co3O4 (P–Co3O4) by treating Co3O4 with Ar plasma in the presence of a P precursor (NaH2PO2). The obtained P–Co3O4 showed outstanding OER performance. P–Co3O4 presented better electrical conductivity than VO–Co3O4 and P–Co3O4 which would be beneficial for electrochemical processes in terms of electron transfer, thereby improving its OER catalytic activity. Ma et al.105 prepared Co3O4 with oxygen vacancies by treating with Ar plasma (Co3O4−x). The good OER and ORR activity is ascribed to abundant catalytically active sites supplied by Co3O4−x and improved conductivity, owing to numerous oxygen vacancies formed in Co3O4−x. Dou et al.112 reported atomic-scale CoOx species by treating ZIF-67 with O2 plasma. The excellent OER performance exhibited by CoOx-ZIF is due to its good conductivity. The amorphous structure of the surface of the transition metal oxide catalyst also greatly improves the electrical conductivity of the catalyst. Chen et al.148 demonstrated that breaking the chemical bonds in a perovskite (SrCo0.85Fe0.1P0.05O3−δ) lattice through plasma sputtering led to the formation of amorphous nanofilms, and the excellent OER and HER performance exhibited by amorphous nanofilms was due to their good electronic conductivity.
Apart from electronic conductivity, Mefford et al.98 found that the ionic conductivity of perovskite cobalt oxides La1−xSrxCoO3−δ also showed positive correlation with OER activity. They found that the oxygen ion diffusivity increased with Sr concentration. SrCoO2.7, with a vacancy concentration of δ = 0.30 ± 0.03, had a diffusion rate of D = 1.2 ± 0.1 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 at room temperature, which is ∼40 times faster than that of LaCoO3, with a complete oxygen sublattice with a diffusion rate of D = 3 ± 1 × 10−14 cm2 s−1. The results highlight the benefit of substitution of a lower-valence ion into the A-site as an effective means of increasing the mobility of oxygen in perovskite oxide electrodes (Fig. 17a). In addition, the catalytic activity toward the OER was found to strongly correlate with the oxygen diffusion rate and the vacancy concentration, δ, as presented in Fig. 17b. The correlation of oxygen evolution activity with the oxygen ion diffusion rate indicates an increased surface exchange kinetics trend with increased OER activity.

3.2.3 Formation of secondary surface active phases. 
Most researchers believe that the catalytic reaction occurs on the surface of the catalyst. The presence of anion defects on the surface of transition metal oxides may generate secondary surface active phases, causing differences in catalytic performance.
Thermal annealing and solution treatment are simple methods of introducing secondary surface active phases.97,125,136,138 For example, Cheng et al.97 showed that the ORR activity of MnO2 could be improved by generating oxygen vacancies through thermal annealing in air (400 °C for 2 h). Secondary surface-active phases (oxygen deficiencies) were introduced into manganese oxides by heat treatment (Fig. 17c).
The exsolution of transition metals or NPs also causes the formation of secondary surface active phases, thereby improving the catalytic performance for the OER or ORR.120,124 For Co3O4, during the OER, the secondary surface active phase (cobalt oxyhydroxide, CoOOH) was reported to be facilitated by the presence of Co2+, and plasma treatment can help to induce Co valence changes and improve the transition of its active phase, thereby improving its OER or ORR catalytic performance.106,112,113
Interestingly, the amorphous phase of the perovskite material also becomes a secondary active phase, exhibiting good OER activity.139,148 Lam et al.139 reported La0.8Sr0.2CoO3−δ (LSC) treated with a 30 wt% H2O2 aqueous solution and found that its OER activity was strongly enhanced. The improvement is attributed to the reaction between LSC and H2O2 and the corresponding formation of a secondary surface active phase (amorphous layer), composed of a hydrous oxide, on the LSC surface (Fig. 17d).


3.2.4 Modifying the surface absorption. 
The adsorption and desorption of reactants or reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface critically determine the OER and ORR kinetics. The presence of anion defects was reported to strongly modify the surface absorption, leading to significant changes in the ORR and OER performance.
For the general OER and ORR in the liquid phase, the interaction of H2O with the catalyst surface is particularly important. Bao et al.165 illustrated the adsorption of H2O molecules onto the spinel structure and the partial charge density of NiCo2O4 with oxygen vacancies. The existence of an oxygen vacancy could decrease the hindrance of the adsorption of H2O, as the adsorption of H2O at a Co3+ site is more favorable than that at low-coordination sites. As shown in Fig. 18a, a Co3+ center, which tends to be octahedrally coordinated, is more active toward the adsorption of H2O near an oxygen vacancy in the surface to achieve a coordination number of six than in a surface without oxygen vacancies. The adsorption energy for a surface with one oxygen vacancy is −0.75 eV, which is lower than that of the perfect surface (−0.41 eV).

KGaA, Weinheim. 
For the OER, the critical reaction process includes the following steps: adsorption of OH−,86,137 generation of activated intermediates (O* or OOH*),40,103,107–109,111,127,133,135,180 and desorption of oxygen.97,135 The step requiring the highest Gibbs free energy (ΔG) is the rate-determining step (RDS) in the OER. Kim et al.86 synthesized single-phase Ca2Mn2O5. The refined cell parameters of Ca2Mn2O5 show that the unit cell structure elongates in the b- and c-directions preferentially. This distortion arising from oxygen vacancies should help OH− ion uptake into the oxygen vacant sites. The perovskite structure of CaMnO3, on the other hand, has Mn4+ (3d3) with a t32g electronic configuration, which cannot easily form a bonding structure with OH−, thus showing a lower OER activity than Ca2Mn2O5. Li et al.180 reported an improved OER activity of LaFeO3−δ perovskite by P doping. The enhanced OER activities of the perovskite material are originated from the fact that, owing to the existence of a certain amount of Fe4+, the adsorption of HO* becomes more efficient. Zhang et al.40 doped B into CoO nanowires. The following conclusions can be drawn from theoretical calculations: the RDS is the formation of *OH for CoO with a limiting barrier as large as 0.67 eV, whereas B-doped CoO-Ov shows a much lower limiting barrier of 0.31 eV, with the oxidation of *OOH to evolve O2 molecules as the RDS in the overall OER process.
The ORR normally include the following key steps: adsorption of O2, O2 cleavage, and so on. Lower oxygen binding energy110,119,142,180 and O2 cleavage energy97,110 can significantly increase the ORR activity. Peng et al.110 reported enhanced ORR activity for sulfur-doped CMO nanotubes compared with undoped CMO. Such enhancement was attributed to the decrease in the absorption energy of O2 for CMO/S, indicating a stronger and easier capability of adsorbing O2 for the ORR of the latter. Yu et al.142 doped N into Co3O4 nanowires and found the N-doped Co3O4 exhibited lager current densities at the same potentials, which indicated that the ORR activity improved after N doping. The calculated absorption energy of O2 for N-doped Co3O4 decreased by 0.30 eV when compared with that of undoped Co3O4, indicating that it has a greater capability of adsorbing O2. Moreover, the OO double bond in adsorbed O2 is lengthened from 1.341 to 1.352 Å after N-doping (Fig. 18b), which could facilitate O2 cleavage and further boost the ORR activity.

4. Conclusions and outlook
The development of low-cost, highly efficient electrocatalysts for the OER and ORR is vital to significantly enhance the efficiency and commercial viability of many energy storage and conversion systems, such as electrolysis cells, fuel cells, and rechargeable metal–air batteries. Anion defect engineering represents a novel approach to enhance the OER and ORR performance of transition metal oxides. In this review, we summarized recent advances in tuning the OER and ORR activity of transition metal oxides via controlling the anion defects. We first described the methods that can be used to generate anion defects in transition metal oxide catalysts, including thermal treatment, cation doping, solution processing, anion doping, energetic particle bombardment, and interfacial effects. The mechanisms of how anion defects affect the catalytic activity were then discussed in detail, which include modifying the bulk electronic structure, changing transport properties, formation of secondary surface active phases, and modifying the surface absorption. Despite the many successful demonstrations of enhancing the activity through the tuning of anion defects, there are still many challenges to overcome, which require systematic investigation.
First, the mechanisms of how anion defects altering the ORR and OER activity of transition metal oxides are still not well understood.181–184 The most intensively investigated anion defects to date are oxygen vacancies and anion doping (sulfur, phosphorus, and nitrogen). In certain transition metal oxides, oxygen defects can exist not only in the form of oxygen vacancies, but also in the form of oxygen interstitials. The representative examples are layered perovskite oxides (Nd, Sr)2NiO4 (ref. 163, 185 and 186) and (La, Sr)2CoO4.158,161,187 The impacts of oxygen interstitials are still elusive. Certain metal oxides such as (Pr, Br, Sr)2(Co, Fe)O5+δ could accommodate hydrogen in the materials and displayed considerably high proton conductivity.188,189 However, it is still not clear if the presence of hydrogen in metal oxides can play a role in altering the ORR and OER kinetics. Apart from simple point defects, defect clusters, line defects (such as dislocations), and grain boundaries can also change the local electronic structures and transport properties of metal oxides. For instance, Navickas et al.190 reported accelerated oxygen diffusion along the dislocation in (La, Sr)MnO3. Because dislocations and grain boundaries are generally observed in transition metal oxides, it is necessary to understand their effects on the electrocatalytic activity of materials. To draw a reliable conclusion about the effects of anion defects on the activity of transition metal oxides, it is necessary to combine experimental approaches with advanced theoretical analyses such as DFT and molecular dynamics. Theoretical calculations can better predict the changes in the local electronic structure induced by different defects, and clarify the possible reaction pathways for the reaction to occur in the presence of defects. Combining such information obtained from theoretical calculations with experimental characterization of the defect structures and reaction kinetics, we can gain better understanding of the role of anion defects in determining the activity, which is essential for the rational design of high-performance catalysts.100,117,142
Second, it is still very challenging to effectively generate anion defects with well-controlled density, type, and distribution. Although thermal treatments have been widely used to create oxygen vacancies in metal oxides, they may lead to agglomeration or coarsening in the microstructure of nanomaterials.126,127 Using solution processing, however, it is difficult to obtain a well-controlled defect type and density. The methods used for cation and anion doping depend sensitively on the material systems. Energetic particle bombardment treatment has high requirements on the equipment and may be difficult to scale up. Based on the understanding of the effects of anion defects, one can tune the anion defects controllably by combining different techniques, and eventually obtain an electrocatalyst with high activity and stability.
Third, in addition to high activity, the long-term stability of catalysts is also essential for practical applications of energy devices. Although previous studies have demonstrated that anion defects critically affected the activity of transition metal oxides, the long-term stability of such effects is still elusive in many cases. It is well known that anion defects can evolve dynamically, depending on the electrochemical reaction conditions. For instance, the intercalations of oxygen into oxygen vacancies in alkaline electrolytes were observed previously in certain oxygen-deficient perovskite oxides.103,191,192 Therefore, it is necessary to understand how anion defects change over time under operating conditions and how such changes impact the activity. To obtain such an understanding, advanced in situ (or in operando) characterization techniques are required to provide valuable information about the evolution of the anion defects and material properties under operating conditions. Some of the representative in situ techniques used in OER and ORR study are shown in Section 3.1. The combination of these advanced in situ techniques with electrochemical measurement will help us to better understand the roles of anion defects and how they evolve over time, providing information beneficial to the rational design of highly active catalysts.
While transition metal oxides are taken as examples in this review to illustrate the effects of anions on ORR and OER activity, the techniques described for the generation of defects and the methodology for gaining mechanistic understanding of the role of defects introduced here are applicable to other material systems for a wide range of applications such as photocatalytic reduction of dyes,193 CO2 reduction,194 and lithium ion batteries.195,196
