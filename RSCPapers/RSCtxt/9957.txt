    , Accepted 18th May 2018First published on 19th May 2018AbstractIn this communication, a simple solar rechargeable battery based on the sodium ion storage mechanism with Fe2(MoO4)3 microspheres as anode materials is proposed for the first time. The battery can be photo-charged under solar irradiation, and discharged reversibly in the dark. Therefore, photon–electron conversion, and energy storage and release based on reversible sodium ion insertion and extraction can be realized in the solar rechargeable battery.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted extensive attention over the past decades because they provide a promising way to convert solar energy into electricity directly with efficient photovoltaic conversion efficiency at low cost.1,2 However, there are two problems for the development of DSSCs: (1) the stability of the output power always fluctuates along with unstable irradiation; (2) how to store solar energy rather than being consumed immediately.3,4 One strategy to resolve these problems is to explore new techniques for the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy stored in some valuable chemical fuels. Following this idea, hydrogen production using a photocatalyst in a photo-electrochemical cell (PEC)5 and conversion of CO2 to chemical fuels (such as CO, CH3OH, and CH4) are widely investigated.6 Whatever great advances in solar fuel production are achieved, the cost of solar water splitting7,8 and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction9 is still high and the conversion efficiency is still low in terms of practical application. Compared to these approaches of solar energy utilization, some developments focusing on the storage of solar energy in energy storage systems have also attracted considerable interest.10–14 Most of the reported photocatalytic charging systems incorporate a DSSC with a capacitor/battery.15–19 However, a photovoltaic cell combined with a capacitor exhibited low overall photoelectric conversion and capacitance efficiencies. In addition, although these studies have adequately proved the viability of the concept and achieved good performance, complicated fabrication methods limited their application.20–23 Thus, searching for a low-cost and compact device is essential for the transfer and storage of solar energy in large-scale applications.
The selection of charge-storage materials is very important for improving the performance of solar rechargeable batteries (SRBs). Many anode materials as energy storage materials for SRBs have been studied, such as CuFeTe2,24 conducting polymers of polypyrrole (PPy) and Nafion/PPy,25–27 WO3,28–32 nano-electrode PVDF/ZnO,33 polyviologen,34 and BiVO4–PbOx.35 Besides, the present SRBs generally use electrolytes containing Li salts, which have resource limitations for large-scale applications. A novel view is focused on sodium ion storage to develop low-cost energy storage systems. Due to the low price and non-toxicity of iron and sodium, Fe2(MoO4)3 was reported as a potential candidate for sodium ion storage.36 This means that Fe2(MoO4)3 could be used as an energy storage electrode based on sodium ion storage for fabricating solar rechargeable batteries.
In this work, we use Fe2(MoO4)3 microspheres as the counter electrode for solar conversion, which are also designed as energy storage electrodes or anodes in solar rechargeable batteries. The system consists of a dyed-TiO2 photo-anode, a Fe2(MoO4)3 energy storage electrode and an internal Pt/Ti mesh as the electrocatalytic electrode during discharge in the dark. The photo-anode and counter electrode compartments are separated by a Nafion 117 membrane, through which the sodium ions can permeate effectively. Under solar irradiation, the photo-generated electrons in the photo-anode are transferred and stored in the Fe2(MoO4)3 electrode with simultaneous Na ion insertion, while in the dark, the Fe2(MoO4)3 electrode releases charge in junction with the I−/I3− couple on the Pt/Ti electrode, like a normal secondary battery.
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a, in light illumination mode (connection of A and C), photo-generated electrons on the dyed TiO2 photo-anode are injected into the conduction band of TiO2. Subsequently, the excited dye molecules are reduced to the ground state by I− ions with production of I3− ions. The injected electrons flow through the TiO2 network to the Fe2(MoO4)3 anode via the external circuit. Here, Fe2(MoO4)3 accepts electrons to undergo a reduction reaction, and thereby electrons are stored at the anode by photo-charging. Inside the cell, sodium ions are diffused through the polymer membrane in order to counterbalance the charge created by the extraction of electrons from the photo-anode. The stored energy could later be released through the I−/I3− couple on the Pt/Ti electrocatalytic electrode and Fe2(MoO4)3 electrode after switching to the discharge mode (connection of B and C). A more compact illustration of the integrated energy unit is shown in Fig. 1b. Here, Fe2(MoO4)3 microspheres are considered as multi-functional electrodes in the solar rechargeable battery, and act as counter electrodes to receive the photo-generated electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 in the photovoltaic conversion process of DSSCs. Simultaneously, electrons are in situ stored in the Fe2(MoO4)3 electrode, which is designed as the electron-storage electrode. In the discharge process of the secondary battery, the Fe2(MoO4)3 electrode is considered as the anode, coupled with the I−/I3− cathode to fabricate the secondary battery.

In this work, Fe2(MoO4)3 microspheres are prepared by hydrothermal treatment of a mixture of Fe(NO3)3 and (NH4)6Mo7O24 to obtain a pale green product.37 The resultant Fe2(MoO4)3 is subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization, as shown in Fig. 2. The diffraction peaks can be indexed well to the following cell parameters: a = 15.73, b = 9.231, and c = 18.22 (JCPDS card number: 35-0183), indicating the monoclinic structure of Fe2(MoO4)3.

As shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the TiO2 film on the FTO substrate is uniform with a good mesoporous structure and high surface area for dye coating (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3b, TiO2 nanoparticles are interconnected, which is beneficial to improve electron transmission and provide facile channels for I−/I3− species transportation.38 In Fig. 3c and d, the good spherical morphology of Fe2(MoO4)3 can be observed, and the microsphere with a diameter of about 20 μm is composed of loosely aligned nanoflakes. Such Fe2(MoO4)3 microspheres can provide more active surface areas and facile ion pathways stacked by nanoflakes for rapid kinetics and structural stability during sodium ion insertion and extraction processes.

Fig. 4a shows the CV profile of the Fe2(MoO4)3 electrode in the sodium half-cell with a sweep rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Two pairs of redox peaks are observed during the oxidation and reduction processes at around 2.48/2.70 V and 2.62/2.75 V (vs. Na/Na+).39 In the reduction process, Fe3+ in Fe2(MoO4)3 is transformed to Fe2+, accompanied by the incorporation of Na ions. In the corresponding oxidation process, Na ions are released from the compound. The results indicate a reversible electrochemical reaction of Fe2(MoO4)3 with sodium ion insertion/extraction.40Fig. 4b displays the CV curve of the anode-active NaI dissolved in the organic electrolyte. There are two pairs of redox peaks at 0.30/0 V and 0.75/0.50 V (vs. Ag/Ag+), respectively, corresponding to a two-step reversible electrochemical reaction of I−/I3−.41 I3− can be completely reduced to I− at a potential of 0 V, which is higher than the oxidation potential of Fe2(MoO4)3 (−0.1 V, vs. Ag/Ag+). Therefore, the working mechanism of the SRB is feasible in terms of the redox potential of I−/I3− and NaxFe2(MoO4)3/Fe2(MoO4)3. To demonstrate the sodium storage performance, the electrochemical performance of Fe2(MoO4)3 is shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†). Here, the discharge potential plateau is around 2.6 V (vs. Na/Na+), and a reversible capacity of 60 mA h g−1 is obtained at 0.1C with a good capacity retention of 75% after 50 cycles, indicating that the Fe2(MoO4)3 electrode can realize reversible sodium storage in the SRB.

To make sure the photo-charge performance of the SRB, we monitored the photocurrent over a long period under illumination. Fig. 5 shows the photo-current and photo-voltage profiles of the SRB under illumination. The cell is photo-charged under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation for 50 minutes. An initial anodic photo-current of 1.3 mA cm−2 is observed, and the photo-current decreased quickly with increasing time. A stable photo-current of 60 μA cm−2 was obtained for the following illumination. The battery voltage is found to be dramatically increased to 0.6 V during the first few seconds and then gently rise to a stable voltage (0.63 V). The stable voltage is considered to be induced by the difference of Eredox between the dyed-TiO2 photo-anode and the I−/I3− redox couple.

To understand the discharge performance of the SRB, the cell is analyzed under different current densities in the dark. From Fig. 6a, it is observed that, at a current density of 20 μA cm−2, the battery voltage is decreased rapidly to 0.35 V and then a steady power output is maintained, which is ascribed to the reduction of the photo-charged I3− and the oxidation of the photo-charged NaxFe2(MoO4)3. The discharge time of the cell could last for 2 hours at 20 μA cm−2, 1 hour at 30 μA cm−2 or 0.5 hour at 40 μA cm−2 after photo-charging under the same illumination. The average voltage of the cell drops with increasing the discharge current. The large polarization at the high current density is due to the low ionic conductivity of the electrolyte and large spacing between the anode and cathode in the present cell so as to increase the cell resistance.42,43 On the other hand, the rate capability of Fe2(MoO4)3 is not excellent enough to match the photo-anode part, when the discharge current is increased. To further verify the feasibility of this system, the cell is subjected to repeating photo-charge and discharge cycles. Fig. 6b shows that the photo-charge curves under illumination and discharge curves in the dark maintain their identity for four cycles, indicating relatively good cycling stability for the SRB. It is demonstrated from the above results that this solar chargeable battery with the dye-sensitized TiO2 photo-anode and Fe2(MoO4)3 energy storage anode based on Na-ion storage can achieve the unity of the reversible photo-charge and energy output. However, long term cycle stability is still a challenge for the solar chargeable battery, which is operated in the half sealed cell. For example, the discharge time at the fourth cycle is a little shorter as compared to the initial three cycles, and the discharge voltage plateau is divided into two plateaus, implying the gradual degradation of the cell. In contrast, the electrochemical cycle stability of Fe2(MoO4)3 is good for Na-ion storage in the full sealed cell (Fig. S1†), eliminating the negative impact of the Fe2(MoO4)3 anode on the stability. Therefore, the stability of the solar chargeable battery could be improved further after optimization design of the cell structure and sealing technology.

Conclusions
In this work, we describe a hybrid solar-electricity system with dyed TiO2 as the photoactive layer and Fe2(MoO4)3 as the energy storage electrode for compact application in solar energy conversion and storage. The system can be charged to above 600 mV under solar light irradiation in seconds, and maintain good cycling stability, demonstrating its solar rechargeable capability. For the first time, the SRB can realize photon–electron conversion and energy output in one unit based on reversible Na-ion insertion and extraction. This device is especially suitable for low-cost applications. The preliminary results are encouraging, and further improvement could be expected through optimization of the storage materials and the cell structure.
