Their photophysical properties are strongly influenced by spin–orbit coupling exerted by the iridium core, usually resulting in intense, short-lived emission, which can be systematically tuned as a triumph of molecular engineering. This Perspective aims to present recent breakthroughs and state of the art on emissive Ir(III) compounds, in particular a personal account on heteroleptic [Ir(N^C)2(L^X)]+ complexes, addressing the mechanistic concepts behind their luminescence.

Introduction
Light-emitting devices (LEDs) have emerged as an alternative to conventional incandescent and fluorescent lamps because of their efficient light generation, resulting in low power consumption, low voltage and low current operation, fast response time, long durability, high performance and low maintenance, due to eco-friendly fabrication processes.1–4 Organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs)5–8 and light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs)9–12 find applications in computers, mobile phones, TV sets, watches and displays, as low-energy-consumption devices.4–6,8,13
Research on OLEDs and LECs mainly focuses on multi-color, highly-emissive complexes and new techniques for device fabrication. For this purpose, iridium(III) coordination compounds have played a prominent role in many applications in photonics, as biological phosphorescent labels and sensors,14–18 photodynamic therapy,15,17 metallopharmaceuticals with antitumoral activities,17 dye-sensitized solar cells,19–22 and catalysis.23–27 Most investigations have focused on photophysical properties, with promising applications in the active luminescent layers of OLEDs and LECs.7,8,28 The choice of Ir(III) is keyed to its high spin–orbit coupling (SOC), ξIr = 4430 cm−1,29 and on the very strong electronic interaction between the metal-core and ligands through the metal–ligand bonds.30 These characteristics lead to remarkable and unique features, including excellent thermal and photochemical stabilities with a variety of ligands, relatively short-lived excited states, impressive emission quantum yields and color variety through judicious molecular engineering by control of ligands.29–40
In this Perspective, we report recent breakthroughs and the state of the art on highly-efficient emissive Ir(III) complexes including a personal account elucidating the role of molecular and electronic structures in controlling the photophysics of heteroleptic Ir(III) compounds of importance in light-emitting devices.28,29,40,41
Photophysics of Ir(III) complexes
Principles
Emissive decay from excited to ground states occurs through a combination of radiative (kr) and non-radiative processes (knr), with their corresponding rate constants related to the excited-state lifetime (τ) and the emission quantum yield (ϕ) as shown in eqn (1) and (2).42–44 (1) (2)
Emission is usually due to a phosphorescence from a formally spin-forbidden T1 → S0 transition which is facilitated by the high spin–orbit coupling (SOC) constant for Ir(III) of ∼4 × 103 cm−1.8,45 The high magnitude SOC constants for the 5d elements – notably for iridium, osmium and platinum – play a very important role in their excited-state decay.29,45 In addition, charge transfer (CT) transitions tend to have higher phosphorescent yields with higher kr values because of their higher transition dipole moments,8,29,34,44 as will be discussed below. Phosphorescence from ligand centered (LC) excited states exhibits similar τ and spectral shapes to the free ligand emission. Metal centered d–d transitions are the least emissive (ϕ ∼ 10−5)5 and typically undergo rapid, non-radiative decay, often accompanied by ligand loss.
Since 2000, the synthesis of novel Ir(III) phosphorescent complexes has received new emphasis due to their strong phosphorescence from MLCT triplet states that have led to both applications and a strategic understanding of LED fabrication with the importance of high emission yields and microsecond lifetimes.5,13 Another desired characteristic is their high photo and thermal stabilities, which enable long device lifetimes. Adjusting ligands allows for emitting complexes in all three primary colors – blue, green and red – as featured in the following sections.
Heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes
The three bidentate ligands coordinated to the Ir(III) with neutral nitrogen or monoanionic carbon/oxygen/sulfur atoms, Fig. 1, give highly phosphorescent Ir(III) compounds. Two of the ligands are identical, organometallated to Ir(III) through N^C atoms in a 5-membered metallacycle, with a very-strong quasi-covalent bond between Ir(III) and carbon. These N^C ligands are often named cyclometallated or attached, 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) and its derivatives being typical examples. The third bidentate ligand can be the same N^C ligand (homoleptic) or a different ligand or ligands (heteroleptic), in which case the ancillary ligand is abbreviated as L^X.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures and synthetic routes for different types of Ir(III) complexes. 
Heteroleptic complexes are usually synthesized from the μ-dichloro-bridged precursor [Ir(N^C)2μ-Cl]246 and an ancillary L^X ligand; the N^C ligands in heteroleptic products are in a trans-N,N configuration.47 The ancillary ligand can be neutral or negatively-charged playing an important role in determining the charge of the heteroleptic complex. Diimine N^N ligands, such as bipyridine, phenantroline and pyridiltriazoles, lead to cationic complexes,29 while picolinates N^O40,48 or acetylacetonates O^O49,50 lead to neutral compounds. Anionic Ir(III) complexes are not very common and few reported compounds contain cyanides and thiocyanates51 or dithiolates and sulfinates52 as L^X ligands. Recently, the use of an orotate N^O ancillary ligand led to an anionic complex with quasi-covalent bonds for both Ir–O and Ir–N.53
Coordination of a third cyclometallated N^C ligand leads to a homoleptic complex with a thermodynamically favored facial-configuration (fac-). The fac-isomers are obtained by refluxing either [Ir(acac)3] (acac = acetylacetonate) with three equivalents of N^C54 or [Ir(N^C)2μ-Cl2]2 in the presence of a base or silver triflate (Agtfms).55 The kinetically favored meridional-complex (mer-) is obtained with careful control of the synthetic conditions and the reaction temperature. The mer-isomers can be converted to the fac-isomers by thermal or photochemical conversion.56–58
The many options for ligands and conformations lead to variations in electronic properties that, by ligand tuning, can be used to influence the pathways that dominate excitation and deactivation.32,59,60 An understanding of the nature of ground and excited states and their interactions is crucial in exploiting ligand variation and how they control emissive phenomena in Ir(III) complexes.61,62 TD-DFT studies combined with Franck–Condon (FC) emission spectral fitting provide detailed and useful insights into both electronic and molecular structures of complex excited states and provide a basis for experimental data analysis.29,44
In terms of molecular orbitals (MO), UV-visible transitions in heteroleptic Ir(III) complexes can mostly be classified into two main types:30,34 (1) LC transitions occurring from π to π* orbitals within the same bidentate ligand with a negligible role of the Ir(III) core in the excitation process. Any subsequent photoprocess from LC excitation has excited state characteristics similar to the free-ligand; (2) CT transitions involving electron transfer within the complex can be of two types: (i) metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition, with excitation of an Ir-centered electron to a π* orbital in one of ligands;5 (ii) ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT)63 in heteroleptic complexes from π levels in ligand-A to π* acceptor in ligand-B, with no major role for the Ir-core.
Less intense d–d transitions are usually not observed in room temperature absorption spectra of Ir(III) complexes because of their overlap with higher energy, far more intense, LC and MLCT transitions.30
This Perspective focuses solely on heteroleptic [Ir(Rppy)2(L^X)]+ complexes and arises from our research interest in this area.28,29,40,41Table 1 summarizes the photophysical properties of selected compounds published since 2013. These complexes were chosen, based on an extensive literature survey, for showing emission in different color ranges with high quantum yields – important features for exploitation in efficient devices as discussed throughout the manuscript – as well as similar molecular and electronic structures to the compounds investigated by us.28,29,40,41

Quantum yields are, sometimes, questionable, depending on how well established are the methods or the standards used in measurements. The use of proper standards, with similar λem and ϕ values, is the most important factor as discussed by Brouwer.83 Absolute measurements (e.g. by using integrating spheres) are usually more reliable, although with associated errors. To avoid misleading comparisons, Table 1 also lists the method and/or the standard employed in the ϕ measurements of these complexes.
TD-DFT is an excellent tool for assigning the absorption spectra of [Ir(NC)2(L^X)] complexes, which can be complicated by an overlap with mixed-nature bands. Calculations for a significant number of Ir(III) complexes have shown that the HOMO is a d(Ir)π(N^C) orbital, as depicted in Fig. 2A for [Ir(ppy)2(dmb)]+, with extended electronic interactions between d and π orbitals through the strong Ir(III)–C quasi-covalent bond. Their first lowest-energy singlet transition (S1) results from an orbital promotion from the HOMO to a π*(L^X) LUMO, and has been assigned to a MLCT state with LLCT mixing.29,34,40,84 The wave function (ΨS1) for these MLCT-based S1 states can be considered as a combination of spin (Ω) and spatial parts (ψ) of the dπ- and π*-orbital wave functions,8eqn (3). (3)
 Fig. 2  (A) HOMO and LUMO electron contours, (B) orbital energies calculated by TD-DFT and (C) experimental redox potentials for the [Ir(Rppy)2(N^N)]+ series. Adapted from ref. 29. 
In terms of energy modulation, a change in the cyclometallated moiety to more-stable π(N^C) ligands decreases the d(Ir)π(N^C) HOMO energy, increasing the calculated energy of d(Ir)π(N^C) → π*(L^X) transitions,32,59 as exemplified by the [Ir(Rppy)2(N^N)]+ series, N^N = polypyridinic ligand, Fig. 2B.29 For these MLCT-based S1 states, variations in calculated energies are linearly correlated to differences in redox potentials (ΔE°), obtained experimentally.29 In Fig. 2C, the Ir-based oxidation  shifts anodically from ∼1.48 to 1.80 V by adding electron-withdrawing fluorine groups to ppy,29 a change that can lead to large and strategic blueshifts in absorption and emission spectra.29
On the other hand, electron-donating groups in the L^X moiety increase the S1 energy by increasing the π*(L^X) LUMO energy. For the [Ir(Rppy)2(N^N)]+ series, Fig. 2C, the ligand-based reduction  ranges from −1.09 to −1.22 V by replacing the electron-withdrawing Ph2phen with the electron-donating dmb ligand.29 When the π*(L^X) energy is high enough to overcome the π*(Rppy) energy, S1 becomes a mixed MLCT/LCIr(Rppy)→Rppy state relative to the Ir-Rppy HOMO and a Rppy LUMO, as can be observed in the [Ir(Rppy)2(Rpic)] series, Rpic = substituted-picolinate derivatives.40,48,66 The first three low-lying transitions for [Ir(Fppy)2(Mepic)], for example, are typically ascribed to MLCT/LCIr(Fppy)→Fppy and MLCT/LLCTIr(Fppy)→Mepic.40
Triplet states are generated by spin inversion of the single electron in the singly-occupied LUMO of their singlet counterparts. The wave function (ΨT1) for the triplet counterpart of S1 is described similarly to ΨS1, however with inversion in the sign inside the brackets,8eqn (4). (4)
Formation of a given Tn state is followed by a decrease in the former-Sn energy (ΔESn–Tn) equal to twice the exchange energy (KSn–Tn), an effect that arises from Coulomb intra- and inter-atomic electron repulsions in the triplet state, eqn (5).8 (5)
The exchange energy between 1LC and 3LC counterparts is higher than MLCT-based ones,83 which can lead to close-lying 3LC and 3MLCT states having similar energies.34 Based solely on electronic effects, the emissive, low-lying T1 states can be either MLCT- or LC-based excited states, depending on the ligands.
A 3LC emission is usually media-independent and short-lived, with relatively narrow bands in a vibronically resolved spectrum, while the 3MLCT emission, with a microsecond lifetime, results in a broad non-structured spectrum, highly sensitive to the rigidity of the medium. This so-called rigidochromic effect is only observed for dipole-inductive CT transitions. It arises from the response of the surrounding molecules in the medium to the new configuration of the excited state, largely by local medium dipole reorientation.29,85–88 The reorientation takes place promptly in fluid solutions, yet is restrained in more constricted media, destabilizing the CT state. Similar observations have been reported for series of Re(I), Ru(II) and Os(II) MLCT emitters.85–87,89,90 Moreover, independent of SOC effects, the momentary dipole of pure MLCT transitions also leads to higher radiative rates, since, as shown in eqn (6), kr varies by the square of the transition dipole moment (),8,29,34,44 (6)with  being the average emission energy and n the refraction index of the solvent.
On the other hand, the same trend is not observed for LLCT transitions despite showing a relatively large , since they are followed by weakening of Ir–C bonds, leading to facilitated non-radiative processes.34,91
These spectral characteristics are depicted in Fig. 3A. Emission spectra for the [Ir(Rppy)2(N^N)]+ series shown in nitrile solvents at 298 K are broad and media dependent, characteristic of 3MLCT emissions.29,40 A 80 nm blueshift is observed for [Ir(ppy)2(Ph2phen)]+ upon cooling to 77 K,29 consistent with an increase in the MLCT energy by the rigidochromic effect, Fig. 3B. As for [Ir(Fppy)2(Mepic)], this energy increase is high enough to result in an inversion of the excited state order, with 3MLCT > 3LC, as evidenced by the highly-structured 3LC emission at 77 K,40Fig. 3B.

The use of a selenazole as an ancillary ligand in the [Ir(Rppy)2(N^N)]+ series, [Ir(Fppy)2(phenSe)]+,70Table 1(i), results in a 3MLCTIr(Fppy)→phenSe emission in the green, with photophysical parameters comparable to [Ir(Fppy)2(dmb)]+, with a very high quantum yield of emission of ∼0.96. Members of the [Ir(Fppy)2(phenSe)]+ series have been employed as specific probes for imaging and tracking of mitochondrial structural changes.70 Anionic [Ir(Rppy)2(orotate)]− complexes showed an intense green emission with high quantum yields of 0.58 and 0.69, which are increased to 0.81 and 0.83 for soft salts after coupling to the cationic [Ir(ppy)2(picolylamine)]+ complex.53 Phenylquinoline-based Ir(III) complexes, Table 1(iv), such as [Ir(dpq)2(pic-N-O)] and [Ir(cpq)2(pic-N-O)], are other recently reported examples of highly emissive compounds with an intense 3MLCT yellow emission.74
However, judging the electronic character on the emitting T1 states (mostly LC or MLCT) for most Ir(III) complexes is difficult since SOC also induces an electronic mixing between MLCT and LC states.30 Room temperature emissions for [Ir(Fppy)2(Rpic)],40,64–66,92 [Ir(FMeppy)2(dmab)]+ (ref. 73) and [Ir(FxOp)2(N^X)],71 FxOp = perfluorocarbonyl phenylpyridine derivatives, Table 1(i–iii), for example, are long-lived (a MLCT characteristic) with vibronically resolved spectra (a LC characteristic), as depicted for [Ir(Fppy)2(Mepic)] in Fig. 3A. The synthesis, structural characterization and key emission properties of the archetypal [Ir(Fppy)2(pic)] complex were recently reviewed.93
SOC-mixing has been described by Group Theory, as demonstrated in subsequent discussions for [Ir(ppy)2(N^N)]+ complexes (N^N = polipyridinic ligands, which are 3B2 molecules in a C2v point symmetry),94 with similar approaches viably extended to most heteroleptic [Ir(N^C)2(L^X)] compounds. Following the arguments of Komada et al.,95 who adopted the mono-chelated complex approximation to assign the symmetry and sublevel ordering of mixed-T1 states in [Rh(N^N)3]3+ complexes, the zero-field splitting of the lowest-lying π → π* transition in free N^N ligands is accounted as an A1, A2 and B1 irreducible representation. After coordination to Ir(ppy)2, the C2v symmetry is retained, restricting the three viable dπ → π* MLCT sublevels as B1, B2 and A1. For [Ir(N^C)2(N^N)]+ complexes, MLCT and LC sublevels of the same representation (A1 and B1) are those that are capable of undergoing SOC-induced mixings.
In a simplistic two-electron approximation, the SOC operator (HSO) can be expressed by eqn (7a) and (7b),5 (7a) (7b)where  is the spin angular momentum operator and  is a function of the SOC constant (ζ) and the orbital operator (), eqn (8). (8)
In this treatment, HSO consists of a product of both spatial and spin parts. The first product in eqn (7b) is the symmetrical electron permutation that can mix two different states with the same multiplicity while the second is the opposite, asymmetrical interaction between singlet and triplet states.
The degree of mixing in ΨT1 can be estimated by accounting for the spatial parts of the two states-of-origin (a and b, where a is dominant),8,94eqn (9) and (10). (9) (10)with ΔEa−b the zero-order energy difference between a and b.
In considering triplet/singlet mixings, direct SOC between low-lying-3MLCT and 1MLCT states is only feasible if the transitions result from different molecular orbitals having different d-orbitals, as demonstrated by Yersin et al.96 As for a low-lying 3LC state, 3LC/1MLCT permutations are possible only indirectly in a more complex, two-step mechanism, involving a 3LC/3MLCT configuration interaction (CI, supported by the molecular-orbital theory) followed by spin–orbit coupling with 1MLCT. Of special note for Ir(III) complexes, the 3LC/3MLCT is usually very effective, assuming a significant interaction between d and π orbitals through the strong organometallic Ir–C bond.
Photophysical elucidations of heavy-metal complexes, such as Re(I), Rh(III) and Ir(III), have widely incorporated triplet/singlet mixing by perturbation theory.8,84,94–102 This approach dates back to 1986, when Komada et al.95 proposed the symmetry assignment and a model to explain enhanced absorptivities for spin-forbidden triplet bands of [Rh(bpy)3]3+ and [Rh(phen)3]3+ in frozen media, ascribing them to 3LC/1MLCT mixed-states. The triplet/singlet coupling model has been appropriately extended to discuss the emission of Ir(III) complexes,34 yet more detailed photophysical discussions through a complementary account of the triplet/triplet permutation effect are also valuable, in particular for compounds with low-lying 3LC states.
For a low-lying 3MLCT state undergoing 3MLCT/1MLCT or 3MLCT/3LC mixings, for example, eqn (10) can be rewritten as eqn (11a) and (11b) by assuming both interactions individually. (11a) (11b)
SOC-permutations result in energy stabilization, which is related to the square of β, presumably with 3MLCT/3LC dominant as a simple consequence of the smaller ΔE3MLCT-3LC energy gap as compared to ΔE3MLCT-1MLCT,96Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Individual representations of 3MLCT/3LC (A) and 3MLCT/1MLCT (B) SOC-induced permutations. 
The dipole moment for a hybrid-T1 state is better expressed by including SOC effects, as shown in eqn (12), where a and b are the two permuted states. For a more detailed version of eqn (12) and a deeper understanding of individual triplet substates, the reader is referred to the perspective on phosphorescent-OLED mechanisms by Minaev et al.8 or to the review on triplet states of organometallic compounds by Yersin et al.96 MT1 = 〈ψa|M|ψS0〉 × βa−b(12)
From the relationship of kr, βa−b and MT1 (eqn (6), (10) and (12)), more intense T1 emissions result from increased perturbations arising from smaller ΔEa−b values and enhanced MLCT mixing.

Eqn (12) is usually expressed in the form of eqn (13) with 3MLCT/1MLCT mixing, since 3MLCT/3LC mixing occurs between spin-forbidden states, leading to a minor contribution to the corresponding dipole matrix elements.96 MT1 = 〈ψ1MLCT|M|ψS0〉 × β3MLCT–1MLCT(13)
As described by eqn (13), triplet/singlet mixings are responsible for increased absorptivities for normally spin-forbidden triplet absorptions with enhanced oscillator strengths.
To illustrate coupling effects on emission from Ir(III) complexes, an energy diagram for a [Ir(RFppy)2(N^N)]+ series is proposed, Fig. 5. It is based on photoluminescence spectral data at 298 and 77 K available in the literature.29,72,73 The diagram relies on 3MLCT/3LC configuration interactions and emphasizes individual energies of former 3LCN^N and 3MLCTIr(ppy)→N^N counterparts, with their acceptor orbitals at the auxiliary N^N ligand (i.e. dπ1(ppy) → π*(N^N)1 and π1(N^N) → π*(N^N)1 transitions). A similar approach was recently proposed by our group in the photophysical elucidation of the complex [Ir(Fppy)2(dmb)]+.29
 Fig. 5  Energy diagram and 3MLCT/3LC configuration interactions for the [Ir(RFppy)2(N^N)]+ series and 298 K spectra from T1 emissive decays. 
The mixed T1 state of the blue-green [Ir(Fppy)2(dmb)]+ complex possesses mainly a MLCT character, with a broad spectrum (λmax = 522 nm) and a remarkable kr value (15 × 105 s−1).29,40 On the other hand, the 298 K spectrum for [Ir(Fppy)2(dmab)]+ is ∼60 nm blueshifted as a result of the strong electron-donating dimethylamino groups, which destabilize the 3MLCTIr(Fppy)→N^N energy, while 3LCdmb and 3LCdmab energies are similar.73 The 3MLCT destabilization is high enough to invert the energy order and the 3LCdmab counterpart plays a major role in the T1 mixed-nature of [Ir(Fppy)2(dmab)]+.73 The LC inversion decreases kr (2.0 × 105 s−1) and leads to a vibronically resolved emission spectrum, with a spectral profile similar to the free dmab ligand. Using molecular engineering strategies, the kr value can be further tuned by the addition of a methyl group in the Fppy moiety, [Ir(FMeppy)2(dmab)]+, that stabilizes the 3MLCT counterpart, decreasing the energy difference towards the low-lying 3LC counterpart,73 which slightly enhances the MLCT influence in the mixed T1 state, leading to a slightly higher kr (2.3 × 105 s−1) and a minor spectral redshift of 4 nm. An additional replacement of the ancillary dmab ligand to the electron-withdrawing 2,2′:5,2′′-terpyridine ligand, [Ir(FMeppy)2(2,5-tpy)]+, further decreases the MLCT energy, restoring the energy order (MLCT < LC), resulting in a broad redshifted (λmax = 544 nm) spectrum and a higher kr (5.1 × 105 s−1), although smaller than [Ir(Fppy)2(dmb)]+ due to lower state mixing through a higher ΔEMLCT-LC.72 The diagram also depicts the difficulty in obtaining blue emitters with a high kr since the MLCT destabilization increases the energy difference towards the LC state, leading to a greater influence of the LC counterpart in blue-emissive T1 states.
As for T1 states, which are mainly governed by non-radiative decays (vibrational decay), the Energy Gap Law appropriately relates knr and the emission energy (Eem).44 The relationship is expressed by eqn (14) for a single-promoting mode of quantum spacing ħωM within a weak vibrational coupling limit (with Eem ≫ SMħωM and ħωM ≫ kBT).44 A more complete expression with multiple modes is required in order to reconcile deviations from the single-mode treatment. (14a) (14b)
In eqn (15), Eem is approximately equal to the energy gap between the zeroth vibrational levels in the ground and excited states (E0), SM is the electron-vibrational coupling constant associated with ħωM,ṽ1/2 is the fwhm for an individual vibronic line and Vk is the vibrationally induced electronic coupling matrix element. Their values are obtained by Franck–Condon (FC) emission spectral fittings29,40,103,104 and the application of the Golden Rule, as reported by Ito and Meyer.44

Eqn (14) predicts increased non-radiative decays for lower-energy T1 states, hence red-emissive compounds (lower Eem) are usually less efficient as emitters. Some complexes reported recently present promising strategies for leading to efficient red emitters and are listed in Table 1. The use of 1-(benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)isoquinoline as a cyclometallated ligand in the [Ir(btq)2(L^X)] series, Table 1(vi), leads to red 3MLCTIr(btq)→L^X emission, with moderate quantum yields (ϕ ∼ 0.12).75 The phenylbenzo[g]-quinoline ligand in [Ir(pbq-g)2(Ph2phen)]+, Table 1(vii), also results in a red emission, and a further redshift to the near infrared is observed after the addition of an electron-withdrawing sp2-N opposite to the chelating N atom in [Ir(mpbqx-g)2(Ph2phen)]+.76,77 Another interesting strategy is the use of styryl-BODIPY ancillary ligands to harvest red and near infra-red light through π-conjugated linkers that ensure efficient intersystem crossing to long-lived emissive 3LCBODIPY states.78 In a recent study, the [Ir(ppy)2(bpyBODIPY)]+ complex, Table 1(viii), was employed as a multi-functional material in luminescent bioimaging and intracellular photodynamic studies.78
In terms of the emission, infinite scales of color and tonalities are possible to be perceived by the human eye vision. The Comission Internationale d'Eclairage (CIE) quantified the color perceived by humans in three matching functions or spectral sensitivity curves ((λ), ȳ(λ) and (λ)) based on trichromatic stimuli of the human virtual cortex.105,106 The numerical values of these standard matching functions are available as free-access tables.107 In this Perspective, we normalized the photoluminescence spectral data of the complexes listed in Table 1 by the use of eqn (15a)–(15c) and calculated their photoluminescence CIE coordinates (x and y) using eqn (16a) and (16b), leading to the 2D color space chromaticity diagram in Fig. 6. (15a) (15b) (15c) (16a) (16b)
 Fig. 6  Color space chromaticity diagram with CIE coordinates for the photoluminescence of Ir(III) complexes listed in Table 1. 
Photoluminescence CIE coordinates are very useful for an absolute assessment and a quantitative comparison among emission colors of different compounds, yet are underused for photoluminescence. The compounds listed in Table 1 present emission in many different colors and tonalities, exemplifying the outstanding color tuning offered by Ir(III) complexes via molecular engineering. Moreover, for the pursuit and design of white-emitting systems, the CIE diagram can identify emissions in complementary colors, since paired compounds are connectable by a direct line crossing through the “pure white” region at the center (around x = 0.33; y = 0.33). For example, the use of blue [Ir(Fppy)2(Mepic)] (x = 0.14; y = 0.29) and orange-red [Ir(cpq)2(pic-N-O)] (x = 0.64; y = 0.36) compounds in the active layers of emitting devices can result in white-light emitting systems.
Light-emitting devices
The beginning of the LED history dates back to 1907, when Round108 reported, for the first time, the electroluminescence (EL) of SiC (carborundum) after the application of current. The emission process was not well understood, and the LED was described as a Schottky diode rather than a p–n junction diode. Not until 1928 did Lossev109 describe the SiC high-field luminescence phenomenon.110–113 In 1936, Destriau114 observed a light emission from a Cu-doped ZnS thin layer upon the application of AC voltage.110,111,115,116 The first EL device, based on GaAsP junctions, with red emission,117,118 was only reported in 1962 by Holonyak and Bevacqua.119 In subsequent decades, commercial LEDs in different colors were developed, such as green (nitrogen-doped GaP),113,120 yellow (nitrogen-doped GaAsP)113,121 and, in the 90s, blue (GaN:GaInN),122,123 which can lead to the white light emission. For these discoveries of blue-emitting systems, with energy- and cost-savings, Akasaki, Amano and Nakamura were honored with the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics.124
Organic unsaturated polymers and crystals can also be considered semiconductors due to delocalized π-electrons,125 with their HOMO and LUMO analogous to valence and conduction bands. Fluorescent deactivation from S1 is usually observed after external (photo or electrical) excitation of these organic polymers.8 In particular, the organic semiconductor electroluminescence, firstly detected in 1963 by Pope et al.,5,8,126,127 is usually observable in thin films (∼100 nm) assembled in a sandwich type architecture between a metallic cathode (usually aluminum, gold, or alkali-earth metals) and a transparent conducting oxide anode. The use of conductive and blocking multilayers can promote efficient charge transfer to the emissive thin film in a device.7,8,128 The application of an external bias leads to electron and hole injection in the cathode and anode, respectively. After percolating electron/hole conducting/blocking layers, they reach the active film where their close-distance interaction produces excitons, which recombine with light emission.7,8,128 When OLEDs are operating, the statistic ratio of triplet and singlet excitons formed under electrical excitation is 3:1, since injected electrons and holes have an arbitrary spin and are not spin-correlated.5,96 Therefore, the luminescence efficiency of fluorescent organic devices is limited by only singlet excitons because they show a rather restricted selection rule for singlet–triplet transitions.129–131
In 1998, Forrest and Thompson130 developed an innovative approach by using phosphorescent neutral complexes in OLEDs to reach high efficiencies by full use of singlet and triplet excitons. OLEDs based on triplet emitter complexes (guest) in polymers (host) overcome the S–T selection rule by harvesting emission from both singlet and triplet states, leading to remarkable improvements in their luminescent efficiencies.5,8,96 For Ir(III) phosphors, in which the SOC effect plays a major role in their excited states, the external efficiency of the electroluminescent device is almost 100%.
In these Ir(III)-polymer (guest–host) based devices, the polymer must efficiently convey its excitation energy to the T1 excited-state of the emissive Ir(III) complex. There are two main mechanisms of non-radiative energy transfer,5,8 Förster and Dexter. Förster132 is a long-range coulombic interaction through a host-to-guest electromagnetic-induced dipole oscillation and a crucial parameter is the significant spectral overlap between host-emission and guest-absorption. According to Förster, excitation of the guest only leads to singlet excited-states because it is dependent on spin-allowed transitions. On the other hand, Dexter133 transfer is a short-range exchange interaction through an orbital overlap between host and guest and can be applied for both spin-allowed and forbidden transitions. A third mechanism, known as direct charge-trap, is also possible when the HOMO and LUMO energies of both guest and host are comparable.5,134 The charge-trap mechanism is not necessarily an energy transfer process since excitons, both singlet and triplet, are directly generated in the guest and the host works solely as a charge carrier.
[Ir(Fppy)2(pic)], fac-[Ir(pmi)3], and fac-[Ir(Fppy)3] complexes are vastly employed as standard compounds in blue OLEDs, with many examples in the literature. By the addition of a methyl group to the pic moiety in [Ir(Fppy)2(pic)], the novel [Ir(Fppy)2(Mepic)] complex has been engineered as another alternative to the efficient blue emitter for OLEDs.40 A device was recently fabricated in a simple FTO/PEDOT:PSS/PVK:complex/Al architecture (PVK = polyvinylcarbazole) and led to an intense blue-emission, as depicted in Fig. 7A.135 Similarly, [Ir(FxOp)2(L^X)]-doped organic films were employed as active layers in deep-blue OLEDs, resulting in some of the deepest blue emissions ever achieved and high external quantum (EQE = 17%) and current (CE = 21.7 cd A−1) efficiencies.71 Recently, phenylquinoline-based Ir(III) complexes, Table 1(iv), such as [Ir(dpq)2(pic-N-O)] and [Ir(cpq)2(pic-N-O)], were employed in solution-processed orange OLEDs, which combined low fabrication costs and high CEs (26.9 and 18.1 Cd A−1) and EQEs (14.2 and 11.9%).72 Near infrared OLEDs fabricated by using [Ir(pbq-g)2(Ph2phen)]+ and [Ir(mpbqx-g)2(Ph2phen)]+, however, showed low external efficiencies (0.65 and 0.30%).76 Although designed for other applications, [Ir(btq)2(L^X)] and [Ir(ppy)2(bpyBODIPY)]+ complexes75,78 might also be an alternative for near infrared emitting devices as well as [Ir(Rppy)2(orotate)]− complexes as interesting alternatives to enhance the stability of OLEDs based on anionic emitters.53
 Fig. 7  Blue, green and yellow electroluminescence from light-emitting devices based on [Ir(Fppy)2(Mepic)] (A), [Ir(Fppy)2(dmb)]+ (B) and [Ir(ppy)2(dmb)]+ (C). 
A slight modification on the working mechanism of OLEDs by using highly concentrated mobile ions (lithium triflate) in the organic active layer led to the development of the first LEC by Pei et al., in 1995.136 The use of mobile ions drastically changes the operating mechanism and properties of the device,137,138 allowing simpler architectures.10 In LECs, after a charge redistribution driven by an applied external bias, injection of holes and electrons leads to electrochemical oxidation and reduction of the polymer.139–141 Mobile ions with opposite charges stabilize oxidized and reduced species, which recombine to regenerate the original polymer leading to a photon emission. The same approach can be exploited for thin films of solely ionic transition-metal complexes (iTMC),28,137,142 with the advantage of the ionic complex being responsible for both ionic conductivity and photon emission, requiring only a single active layer. The first work using iTMC as an emissive species in LECs was carried out by Lee et al., in 1996.143 The simplicity and considerable efficiency of the devices make them highly desirable for cost saving fabrication and as a sustainable energy source. The majority of the complexes were based on Ru(II); however, nowadays, the use of Ir(III) compounds has been widely emphasized.144 The progress in increasing iTMC LEC performances in terms of turn-on time, stability and efficiency was recently reported in a complete review.144
Concerning iTMC LECs, all complexes in the [Ir(Rppy)2(N^N)]χ series, Table 1(i), present the desired characteristics for active layers due to their appropriate photophysical features and high solubility in benign solvents, essential for solution processable depositions (e.g. printing, layer-by-layer and spin-coating).72,144 [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ and [Ir(ppy)2(phen)]+ have been used as active layers for the development of distinctive LEC architectures. For instance, the use of these complexes and ionic liquids in the active layers in proof-of-concept LECs leads to remarkable improvements in their turn-on time and power efficiency.145 Recently, a thin film of the [Ir(ppy)2(dmb)]+ complex in a FTO/PEDOT:PSS/complex/Al architecture demonstrated a very-high current efficiency of 59.7 Cd A−1 in a yellow electroluminescence,28Fig. 7C. Further molecular-engineering led to the [Ir(Fppy)2(dmb)]+ complex that showed an intense green-electroluminescence in a similar device architecture, Fig. 7B.135 By analogy, [Ir(Fppy)2(phenSe)]+ (having λem, ϕ and T1 values comparable to [Ir(Fppy)2(dmb)]+) also shows potential applicability in LECs. However, high quantum yields are not enough to guarantee desirable device characteristics since some compounds, for example [Ir(FMeppy)2(2,5-tpy)]+,72 give highly unstable and short-lived devices due to adventitious ligand-exchange reactions. To avoid this effect, the use of an intramolecular cage with bulky substituent groups or ligands capable of intramolecular π–π stacking to shield the Ir metal core leads to remarkable improvements in stability.69,144 Therefore, [Ir(pbq-g)2(Ph2phen)]+ and [Ir(mpbqx-g)2(Ph2phen)]+, employed in low external efficiency OLEDs, as discussed above, might also result in more efficient lighting systems such as LECs.
Final remarks
The summary of successful molecular engineering in Ir(III) complexes and the many applications in light-emitting systems cited here are inspiring and illustrate the fascinating strategies that are used to understand and design highly emissive compounds. As demonstrated in this Perspective, theoretical results based on TD-DFT calculations and the application of the Golden Rule give fundamental support to elucidate photophysical dynamics. The use of combined experimental (sometimes, not properly addressed) and theoretical aspects can lead to a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms that result in luminescence, the key element in the design of photoluminescent compounds with the desired properties that can lead to more efficient lighting-devices.
Future molecular design strategies must head beyond energy and color control. A judicious engineering of MLCT/LC excited state mixing is fundamental for obtaining the desired emission energies, spectral shapes, media interactions, and high quantum yields. In the pursuit of smart white-emitting systems, the design of more-efficient red (low-energy gap) and blue emitters (limited by a decreased MLCT influence), is of great interest. The use of photoluminescence CIE coordinates, although underutilized, is a great tool for identifying paired compounds for use in light-emitting devices and modulating their electroluminescence towards the desired colors.
