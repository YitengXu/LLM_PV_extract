    , Accepted 19th April 2021First published on 19th April 2021AbstractA green, clean, and rapid process employing sunlight for converting a large quantity of graphene oxide (GO) into reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is presented herein. In this protocol, the sunlight is concentrated using a Fresnel lens and focused on GO, and the heat thus generated reduces GO into rGO within seconds. The reduction process and quality of the Fresnel lens rGO (FrGO) thus produced are examined via thermal, spectroscopic, surface, and microscopic analyses. The electrochemical properties and charge storage parameters of FrGO are analysed using galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using a symmetric electrochemical double layer capacitor in three electrolytes, viz. an alkaline aqueous electrolyte, a neutral aqueous electrolyte, and an ionic liquid. The supercapacitors thus developed delivered specific discharge capacitances of ∼171, 126, and 135 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with potentials of 1.2, 2.0, and 3.4 V, respectively. Owing to the larger potential window and specific capacitance, the devices fabricated using the ionic liquid delivered the highest specific energy (ES) and specific power (PS). The best-performing device showed an ES value as high as ∼60 W h kg−1 and a PS value as high as ∼6000 W kg−1, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the process reported herein for practical applications.
1. Introduction
The use of graphene and its derivatives as electrodes for supercapacitive charge storage is an intensively researched topic due to their high energy density and chemical stability.1,2 In the supercapacitive charge storage process, the ions in an electrolyte are reversibly and non-faradaically adsorbed on an electrode surface, unlike the faradic charge storage in batteries.3–7 As there is no chemical change during charge storage, supercapacitors can be cycled for a prolonged duration (∼105 cycles) and offer specific power (PS) orders of magnitude higher than that of batteries.8,9 Graphene and its derivatives are an ideal supercapacitive charge storage medium because of their hierarchical porous structure and consequent high electrochemically active surface area (∼3000 m2 g−1), high mechanical and chemical stability and higher electrical conductivity than most materials evaluated for this application.10 Graphene and its derivatives are usually obtained through a top-down approach by the exfoliation of graphite into single- or few-layer sheets. The chemical oxidation exfoliation method is a more versatile process to obtain graphene on a large scale, but the oxidation results in water-stable graphene oxide (GO) sheets, which are non-conducting due to the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups.11–13 Therefore, GO sheets must be converted into conductive reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for electrical/electronic applications. Eco-unfriendly chemicals (such as phenyl-containing compounds, sodium borohydride, hydrazine hydride, hydrazine, glucose, ascorbic acid, pyrrole, hydroquinone, amino acid, hydroxylamine, strong alkaline solutions and urea) are used for removing oxygen-containing functional groups, but result in restacking of the graphene sheets during the cleaning and the drying process, thereby ultimately reducing the surface area and producing large amounts of waste chemicals as by-products.14,15
One alternative to chemical reduction is thermal reduction, in which GO is reduced by agitating the oxygen-containing functional groups with the help of heat sources. The thermal sources exfoliate and reduce the GO layer by inducing pressure, consequently removing the oxygen groups by generating CO2 and CO.16 In thermal annealing, normally, GO powder is exposed to a high temperature in air or in an inert atmosphere. At high temperatures, the functional groups are removed, and at the same time, exfoliation occurs, thereby generating a large surface area. Thermal annealing has been carried out using various methods such as microwave heating, laser, and flame-induced reduction, among others, and the rGO thus produced has been tested for its usefulness as a supercapacitor electrode to evaluate its relative merits and drawbacks. In addition to the above methods, other mechanisms have also been reported, which include flame reduction, hot plate reduction, and soldering iron reduction.17–19 The reduction of graphene through thermal means by focusing solar light using an optical lens has also been reported;20,21 the optical lens helps to achieve a temperature of up to 200 °C, which could convert GO to rGO. A brief survey of these developments is given in the ESI (S1).† Although various methods have been proposed for the reduction of GO, still more improvement is required; in the case of chemical reduction processes, most of the graphene is partially restacked in the form of graphite in the aqueous reducing media. Due to its reduced surface area, GO obtained by chemical routes shows lower performance compared to thermally reduced graphene oxide in which a high surface area is achieved.
Among these techniques, the solar reduction of graphene is a cost-effective green process in which sunlight is focused by a converging source, thereby raising the temperature and reducing the GO into rGO.22 Although direct sunlight exposure reduces GO, the reduction is partial and requires a prolonged exposure time.23,24 Conventional lenses are heavy, thick and bulky, and are practically non-ideal to manufacture in large sizes, particularly for the purpose of concentrating solar light to generate heat. On the other hand, Fresnel lenses are low-cost, lightweight, and thinner, and have the ability to concentrate more light waves at a single focus point, thus generating more heat.25 Fresnel lenses are based on the idea that the bulk of the lens contributes less to the bending of light, so part of the lens is replaced by concentric grooves, each of which plays the role of a refracting surface to converge parallel rays at a single focal point (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†). This removal process not only allows the construction of Fresnel lenses with larger apertures of desirable sizes, but also makes them lighter. Fresnel lenses can be made using polymeric materials with accurate grooves and bending angles, which not only increases their optical transmission and makes them perfect light concentrators,26,27 but also enables them to be produced in large scale for industrial applications. Recently, due to modern molding techniques, computer control fabrication processes and the availability of highly transparent plastics such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), the construction of lightweight, thin and glass-free Fresnel lenses with larger sizes than glass lenses has become possible. Such large-area Fresnel lenses can concentrate more solar radiation compared to ordinary glass lenses.26
In this work, the reduction of GO through direct sunlight exposure using a Fresnel lens as an alternative to a small optical glass lens is presented. The reduction process and quality of the Fresnel lens rGO (FrGO) thus produced have been systematically examined using thermal, spectroscopic, surface and microscopic analyses. The electrochemical properties and charge storage parameters of FrGO have been analysed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge–discharge cycling (CDC) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using a symmetric electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) fabricated using the FrGO electrodes in three electrolytes, viz. 6.0 M KOH, 1.0 M Na2SO4, and the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazoliumtetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4). The best-performing device showed a specific energy (ES) as high as ∼60 W h kg−1, and PS as high as ∼6000 W kg−1, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the process reported herewith for practical applications.
2. Experimental details
The GO was synthesized as detailed in the ESI (S2).† Assuming that heat could be generated by the concentration of light, a Fresnel lens was used for the reduction of GO. A square-shaped Fresnel lens with a ∼350 × 350 mm area and a ∼3 mm thickness made from PMMA was used in this work. The lens had the following specifications: focal length ∼370 mm, concentration multiple ∼1000×, magnification ∼4–5×, and optical transmittance ∼92%. A schematic of the Fresnel lens and the tabulated specifications are provided in the ESI (Fig. S1 & Table T1†). Approximately 200 mg of GO was uniformly spread over an alumina disc with a diameter of ∼4 inches and placed under a previously focused Fresnel lens at 1200 noon on a hot sunny day. The temperature at the focal point was measured using an infrared thermometer (Benetech, GM 1150 A). The solar irradiance was measured using a Lux meter and was ∼80 ± 2 mW cm2. The initial brown color of the GO changed to a blackish color upon <30 seconds exposure to the sunlight; the color change spread outward from the focal point of the lens. As a result, sponge-like graphene was obtained, and was further freeze-dried and stored in sealed containers in a desiccator for further analysis.
The reduction process was primarily studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Model: Pyris1 TGA analyser) by comparing the weight changes in the GO and FrGO samples. The TGA was conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere in the temperature range 25–700 °C. The chemical structure of the FrGO was studied using powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD) (X'Pert3 X-ray diffractometer) employing CuKα radiation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo scientific, K-Alpha, USA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (model: Perkin Elmer) and Raman spectroscopy (model: Horiba Jobin Yvon HR800). The XRD samples were prepared by drop-casting an ethanolic dispersion of GO and FrGO on the glass slides, followed by drying. The survey XPS spectra were obtained in the 0–1200 eV range in the 50 eV pass energy interval; the high-resolution spectra were recorded at a lower constant pass energy of 20 eV and were fitted using multiple Gaussian curves. Charge-referencing in XPS was carried out using adventitious carbon C at ∼284.8 eV. The surface and morphology of the samples were determined using gas adsorption measurements (Micromeritics, Tristar 3000, USA) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Zeiss Supra 55 VP, UK). The specific surface area and porosity of the GO and FrGO samples were determined from adsorption isotherms. For the FESEM measurements, the preparation of GO samples was achieved by spin-coating a GO dispersion in water on the silicon oxide wafer, whereas the as-prepared FrGO samples were directly dispersed on the silicon oxide wafer.
2.1 Electrochemical studies
The electrochemical properties and charge storage performance of GO and FrGO were studied in coin-type cells (CR2032) in a two-electrode system configuration. The electrodes for the electrochemical studies were prepared by stirring a mixture of 75.0% active material, 15.0% carbon (Super P) and 10.0% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as previously reported.28,29N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) was added to the above stirred mixture, which was then allowed to stir for a further 24 h; the prepared slurry was then pasted on pre-cleaned nickel foam substrates. The electrode mass-loading on the substrate was ∼2.10 mg cm−2. The electrochemical properties and charge storage parameters were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling (CDC), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in three electrolytes, viz., 6.0 M KOH, 1.0 M Na2SO4 and the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazoliumtetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4) using a potentiostat-galvanostat (Autolab, PGSTAT 30, Eco Chemie B.V., The Netherlands). The coin-type cells were assembled using a glass microfiber filter (Fioroni, Italy).
3. Results and discussion
The GO to rGO reduction process was advantageously quick; the entire process spanned less than 30 seconds and could be observed visibly. The temperature of the sample at the focal point of the lens varied randomly between 370 and 400 °C in different experiments. This temperature is much higher than would be expected from the optical absorption of rGO, whose band gap lies between 230–270 nm depending on the oxygen content; lower oxygen content shifts the band gap to longer wavelengths.30,31 This random variation is expected to arise from the uncertainties in the measurement due to the rapid exothermicity of the reduction process. The initial brown color of GO became blackish in 10 seconds of sunlight exposure, after which the black color spread outward from the center of the GO. No further change was observed upon prolonged duration (which was further verified spectroscopically). We also note that the reduction duration reported in this experiment could vary temporally, seasonally, and geographically, as the solar irradiance depends on these factors. Nevertheless, our experiments unambiguously confirm the efficient reduction of GO using a Fresnel lens based on the materials characterization detailed below. The conversion of the GO into Fresnel lens reduced GO (FrGO) was initially tested using TGA (ESI S4, Fig. S2†). The GO showed multistep weight loss corresponding to the loss of adsorbed moisture up to 100 °C and a significant weight loss centered at ∼200 °C due to the removal of unstable oxygen functional groups bound to the basal planes and edges of the GO sheets.32 The gradual weight loss observed in the third stage (from ∼300 °C to ∼700 °C) was due to the remaining functional groups and the pyrolysis of the carbon content of the GO sheets. The residual GO weight at 700 °C was ∼35%, which accounted for the carbon mass in the sample. The thermal instability of GO is mainly due to the elimination of oxygen-containing functional groups bonded to the graphite sheets that were introduced during the synthesis of GO.33,34 On the other hand, FrGO showed only a gradual weight loss similar to that observed in the third stage of the TGA profile of GO, and had a significant residual weight (∼79%) at 700 °C.

Fig. 1 and 2 present the chemical characteristics of the samples before and after the reduction process. Fig. 1 compares the XRD patterns of GO and FrGO. The XRD pattern of GO showed a sharp peak at a 2θ value of ∼10.2° that corresponds to its (001) plane. The spacing of the (100) plane in the GO sheets was ∼0.9 nm, which is much larger than the corresponding spacing in graphite (0.3 nm) due to the various oxygen groups introduced in the planes of GO during the oxidation process.35 A small peak corresponding to the disorder in the GO sheets was observed at 42.87°.36 Upon reduction, the GO peak at ∼10.2° disappeared; however, a new peak at 2θ = ∼24.4° was observed with an interplanar spacing of ∼0.36 nm, corresponding to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon, which is the first evidence of the reduction of GO.37 The spacing of the (002) plane is closer to that of graphite because the thermal energy produced by the solar light eliminated the oxygen from the GO plane, and it thereby provides evidence of the reduction.38 The Debye–Scherrer equation was used to estimate the number of graphene oxide sheets by calculating the average layer height (H) of the stacked layers and the number of layers per sheet; the results are shown in Table 1. The H values of GO and FRGO were 6.6 and 2.21 nm, which correspond to ∼8 and ∼6 sheets, respectively. Thus, the Fresnel lens not only reduced the GO but also helped to exfoliate the graphene layers. The layer height of the GO was reduced three-fold upon exposure to sunlight through the Fresnel lens. Table 1 also compares the degree of exfoliation during the laser thermal reduction reported in our previous work,39 which shows a similar degree of exfoliation.

More spectroscopic evidence for the conversion is presented in Fig. 2 through FTIR, XPS and Raman spectra. The FTIR spectrum of GO presented in Fig. 2(a1) indicated the presence of various oxygen functional groups attached to the GO sheets, including a broad O–H peak (at 3353 cm−1) and CO (at 1722 cm−1), CC (at 1621 cm−1), C–O–C (at 1661 cm−1) and C–O (at 1036 cm−1) peaks. All these vibrations were present due to the oxidation of GO, which indicated the reliability of the synthesis process used.40,41 On the other hand, as can be noted from Fig. 2(a2), the spectrum of FrGO showed considerable reductions in the intensities of the vibrations of the functional groups containing oxygen (CO and C–O–C) and the elimination of the C–O peak. Interestingly, the peak corresponding to the bending and stretching of O–H at 3353 cm−1 nearly disappeared in the spectrum of FrGO. These observations indicate that the thermal energy produced by sunlight through the Fresnel lens eliminated the majority of the oxygen and reduced GO effectively.
XPS was carried out to further evaluate the carbon and oxygen groups present on the surface of the GO that were introduced during its synthesis.42Fig. 2(b1) shows the XPS spectrum of GO, which was fitted into the four major carbon peaks including peaks corresponding to oxygen-containing functional groups (C–C, C–O, CO, and O–CO). The non-oxygenated carbon peak was centered at ∼284.6 eV, the C–O at ∼286.7 eV, the CO at 287.6 eV and the O–CO peak at 288.80 eV. Thus, the XPS results confirm the presence of different types of carbon and oxygen functional groups during the exfoliation of graphite into individual and few-layer GO sheets.43 The calculated carbon-to-oxygen ratio in GO was approximately 1.9, indicating a high content of oxygen. Clear changes are observed in the XPS spectra upon the conversion from GO to FrGO (Fig. 2(b2)). Very sharp peaks were observed for carbon–carbon bonds (both C–C and CC) at a binding energy of ∼284.6 eV, which is confirmation of the presence of graphene.44 The intensity of the peak observed in the GO spectrum for C–O at 286.7 eV was considerably reduced for FrGO. Lower intensity peaks were also observed for π–π* (290.11 eV), O–CO (288.52 eV) and CO (287.70 eV) located at the basal plane of GO,45 all of which indicated that the sunlight focused through the Fresnel lens could eliminate the oxygen functional groups from the GO sheets. Interestingly, the C/O ratio was 5.1, which indicated that most of the sp2-bonded carbons were restored while carbon–oxygen bonds were minimized. Prolonged solar irradiation did not improve the reduction efficiency. To compare the reduction efficiency, we refer to our previous experiments on the reduction of GO using a laser engraver,39 in which a C/O ratio of 3.85 was achieved using a laser with a power of 1.6 W even with a much smaller sample size (∼50 mg). Therefore, comparatively, the experiments reported here could reduce a larger quantity of GO more efficiently than a 1.6 W laser. However, the C/O ratio improved to 6.5 using a laser power of 2 W. Therefore, we also anticipate that using Fresnel lenses with appropriate geometry and focal points, superior reduction efficiency could be achieved.
Finally, Raman spectroscopy was employed to determine the defects and the disorder in the GO and FrGO sheets (Fig. 2(c1) and (c2)).46 Generally, two main bands are present in the spectrum, which are referred to as the D band and G band. The D band originates from the vacancies associated with defects as well as grain boundaries, while the G band is due the E2g scattering of phonons of the first order carbon of sp2-bonded atoms.47 Two discrete and very prominent D band and G band peaks were observed at 1354 cm−1 and 1600 cm−1,48 respectively, in both samples. The ID/IG ratio was calculated to be 0.88 in the GO sample, which shows that the amount of defects present in the sheets is increased by the oxidation process to convert the graphite into graphene oxide with the breakage of sp2 bonds and their transformation into carbon–oxygen bonds on the GO sheets.49 The intensity of the D band was increased in FrGO as compared to GO, which indicated that intensity of edge disorder and local defects increased with solar radiation. This was further supported by the increase in the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of both bands; the FWHM of the D band increased from 182.6 cm−1 (GO) to 222.9 cm−1 (FrGO) and that of the G band increased from 79.6 cm−1 (GO) to 98.8 cm−1 (FrGO). These increases in FWHM indicate high disorder and defects upon the reduction of GO to FrGO.50 The G band corresponding to the presence of sp2 carbon bonds also remained intact. The ID/IG ratio of the FrGO was 0.96, which is higher than that of the GO sample, indicating that structural imperfections were introduced during the solar irradiation process, which could be ascribed to the removal of oxygen-containing functional groups from GO. An increased defect value has also been reported for a GO solution exposed directly to sunlight.20
The physical surfaces of GO and FrGO were examined using FESEM (Fig. 3) and gas adsorption measurements (ESI S5, Fig. S3 and Table T1†). The FESEM micrographs of GO indicate the presence of flat sheets with folding and overlapping at the edges. The size of the sheets varied from micron to sub-micron. On the other hand, the FESEM images of FrGO show non-agglomerated sheets with micro- and mesopores. The sheets were interconnected in the long range with twisted edges. Normally, van der Waals forces between graphitic sheets cause agglomeration; however, in the present case, the freeze-drying process after the solar irradiation process helped to avoid cluster formation of the sheets. The BET surface area of the FrGO was ∼308.2 m2 g−1, which was marginally higher than the surface area of the template-assisted reduced rGO (∼285 m2 g−1) reported earlier.51 The average pore diameter and pore volume of the FrGO were calculated to be 10.43 nm and 0.8 cm3 g−1, respectively.

3.1. Electrochemical performance of FrGO
The electrochemical properties of FrGO were studied in three electrolytes, viz. an alkaline aqueous electrolyte (6.0 M KOH), a neutral aqueous electrolyte (1.0 M Na2SO4) and an ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazoliumtetrafluoroborate; EMIMBF4). Room-temperature ionic liquids have recently attracted attention for supercapacitor applications, as they are low-vapour-pressure liquids with very high thermal stability and offer large potential windows. Although they suffer from high viscosity and lower conductivity, their safety in terms of non-flammability compared to other high-voltage organic liquids make them unique and even acceptable in high-temperature conditions.52–54 In this study, FrGO was used to make supercapacitor devices with two symmetric electrodes using the commercially available ionic liquid (EMIMBF4), as it has high electrical conductivity and stability.
The CV, CDC and the specific capacitance (CS) calculated from the CDC curves of the devices in the three electrolytes are summarized in Fig. 4; the respective figures are arranged vertically for each electrolyte. The potential difference of the electrodes with respect to the electrolyte has been optimized for each electrolyte; the details are provided in ESI S6 (Fig. S4†). The optimized potential windows were 1.2, 2.0 and 3.4 V, respectively, for the 6.0 M KOH, 1.0 M Na2SO4 and EMIMBF4 electrolytes. The electrodes showed quasi-rectangular shapes in all CVs and linear charge decay in the CDC curves; these behaviors characterize that the FrGO electrode as supercapacitive. However, deviation from the ideal rectangular shape could be observed in the aqueous electrolytes, which is most likely due to a small amount of oxygen-containing functional groups still being present in the sample after solar heating using the Fresnel lens. Although the functional groups left over during the reduction process also contribute to the capacitance values, the major capacitive contribution arose due to the electric double layer.55 A longer discharging time than charging time was observed in the CDC curves when using the Na2SO4 (aqueous) and EMIMBF4 (non-aqueous) electrolytes at lower current densities, which is expected to arise from the difference in the charge dynamics of the ions at lower rates due to the difference in the ionic conductivity of the electrolytes. The room temperature ionic conductivities of 6 M KOH, 1 M Na2SO4 and EMIMBF4 are ∼685.3,56 ∼80,57 and ∼17.2 mS cm−1,58 respectively. These differences in ionic conductivities and consequent equivalent series resistance (ESR) are consistently reproduced in the EIS data shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2. Consequently, the delay in accessing the pores increases with a decrease in conductivity; nevertheless, this delay is beneficial for maximizing the charge storage at lower rates, as explained below.

Note that a three-electrode measurement system was employed when using the aqueous electrolytes (KOH and Na2SO4) and a two-electrode system measurement was employed for the ionic liquid (EMIMBF4).

The CS values calculated from the CV curves are detailed in the ESI (Fig. S5†), whereas those calculated from CDC are shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4. The CS of the electrode in the (i) KOH electrolyte for 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 5 A g−1 were ∼172, ∼171, ∼166, ∼153, ∼148 and ∼137 F g−1, respectively; (ii) Na2SO4 electrolyte for 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 A g−1 were ∼150, ∼126, ∼110, ∼108, ∼98 and ∼85 F g−1, respectively; and (iii) EMIMBF4 ionic liquid for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 A g−1 were ∼150, ∼135, ∼105, ∼95, ∼79 and ∼66 F g−1, respectively. A slightly higher CS was observed in KOH than in the other two electrolytes, most likely because of the size match between the K+ ions and pores in the electrode,7,59 as well as its ionic conductivity, which is orders of magnitude higher than those of the other two electrolytes. High CS values were observed for low current densities as the ions had enough time to penetrate the pores, resulting in higher charge concentration across the high surface area of electrode, while low charge accumulation was observed in the electrode at high current densities, resulting in slightly lower capacitance values.60 The relationship between the reduction efficiency and CS was also compared with that in the previously reported reduction using a 1.6 W laser.39 In 1 M KOH electrolyte, the laser-reduced GO gave CS values of 151, 137, 126, 121, and 117 F g−1 at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 A g−1, respectively; i.e., the FrGO offered a 10% higher CS value than that of the laser-reduced GO.
The capacitance performance was validated by measuring and analyzing the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the devices. Fig. 5 shows the EIS spectra of the electrodes from which the total electrode resistance, classified as the equivalent electrical resistance (ESR) and charge transfer resistance (RCT), was calculated. The ESR of the device refers to the active material resistance, electrolyte resistance, current collector resistance and separator resistance,61 and is determined from the offset of the high frequency impedance. On the other hand, the RCT refers to the resistance of charge transfer to the pores in the electrode; an optimal pore diameter with respect to a given ion facilitates efficient charge transport and improves capacitance. These resistances are summarized in Table 2. As can be seen from Fig. 5(a and b) and Table 2, the ESR increases in the order KOH < Na2SO4 < EMIMEF4; this variation could be attributed to the size of the adsorbing ions in these electrolytes as well as the difference in the ionic conductivity of the electrolytes. Similar variation was also observed in the case of RCT, which could be related to the size of the solvated ions and pore diameter of the electrodes. The pore diameter of the FrGO is ∼10.43 nm, which facilitates easy ion adsorption for the solvated K+ and Na+ ions with sizes 3.31 and 3.58 Å, respectively. On the other hand, the size of the boron tetrafluoride ion (BF4−) is relatively larger (22.9 Å); therefore, the RCT of the devices fabricated using the BMIMBF4 electrolyte is larger. The ease of ion adsorption and the development of capacitance can also be observed from the Bode phase and impedance plots shown in Fig. 5(c and d). The closer the low frequency phase angle (Φ) is to 90°, the more capacitive the electrode. The Φ of the devices fabricated using the KOH, Na2SO4 and EMIMBF4 electrolytes are ∼84.2, ∼77.3, and 61.6°, respectively; thereby confirming the consistency of the measurements. Additionally, the higher resistance of the device fabricated using the EMIMBF4 electrolyte in the medium and high frequency ranges in Fig. 5(d) further confirmed the increased RCT of the corresponding devices.
Finally, Fig. 6 compares the calculated specific energy (ES) and specific power (PS) values of the fabricated devices. The maximum ES for the device using (i) KOH as an electrolyte was 8.5 W h kg−1 at a PS of ∼193 W kg−1 and (ii) Na2SO4 as electrolyte was ∼20.3 W h kg−1 at a PS of ∼294.3 W kg−1. The high ES was attributed to the structure of porous FrGO, which provided more reachable areas to accommodate the ions. Also, a moderate ES of ∼12.5 W h kg−1 was observed for 1.8 V at a PS of ∼263 W kg−1, which is higher than for the device tested in 6.0 M KOH electrolyte. A slightly lower ES value of ∼8.9 W h kg−1 was observed for 1.6 V at a PS of ∼232 W kg−1. The highest ES value of ∼60 W h kg−1 was calculated for the device employed in the ionic liquid electrolyte. The high ES of this device is due to the high voltage window achieved using the ionic liquid EMIMBF4, which can charge the device up to 3.5 V. Also, a high PS of ∼6 kW kg−1 was achieved at a moderate ES of ∼22 W h kg−1, which shows the effectiveness of the device in terms of ES and PS. Table 3 compares the ES and PS values of the FrGO with those of high-performing devices reported in the literature; a random selection of reports based on the three electrolytes used in this work is compared here. The devices prepared using FrGO showed superior ES and PS values compared to other rGO-based electrodes in all electrolytes. Therefore, the ES and PS values achieved here indicate the effectiveness of the solar reduction of graphene using a Fresnel lens, and the reduced graphene thus obtained could be used for fabricating high-performance energy storage devices.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a Fresnel lens can be used to synthesize reduced graphene oxide (rGO) rapidly through the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) under sunlight as a thermal source and without engaging any chemicals. In this work, a square-shaped Fresnel lens made from polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) with an area of 350 × 350 mm, a thickness of ∼3 mm, a focal length of ∼370 mm, a concentration multiple of ∼1000×, a magnification of ∼4–5×, and optical transmittance of ∼92% was used to successfully produce 200 mg of rGO. The lens employed in the present study enhanced the carbon-to-oxygen content ratio in pure GO from 1.9 to 5.1 in less than 30 seconds of exposure to sunlight and reduced the layer number in the graphene sheets from 8 to 6. Raman spectral analyses showed that the intensity of the edge disorder and the number of local defects were increased after solar radiation exposure, which would positively contribute to charge storage applications. Electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) fabricated using the Fresnel lens rGO as an electrode in three electrolytes, viz. an alkaline aqueous electrolyte (6.0 M KOH), a neutral aqueous electrolyte (1.0 M Na2SO4), and an ionic liquid (EMIMBF4), delivered discharge specific capacitances of ∼171, ∼126, and ∼135 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with potential differences of 1.2 V (KOH), 2.0 V (Na2SO4), and 3.4 V (EMIMBF4), respectively. The best-performing device was the one fabricated using ionic liquid, which showed a specific energy as high as ∼60 W h kg−1 and specific power as high as ∼6000 W kg−1. Considering the speed of the process, the scalability of the fabricated device, and the promising results achieved in energy storage, the demonstrated process could soon find practical applications.
