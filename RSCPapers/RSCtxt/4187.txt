    , Accepted 11th January 2020First published on 13th January 2020AbstractPower-to-gas is an emerging technology to convert electrical energy into chemical energy, and usually consists of two steps. First, hydrogen or syngas is produced in electrolysis cells, and then the hydrogen is used to methanate COx in catalytic reactors. Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) have the potential to integrate these two steps because methane can be directly synthesized in the SOEC cathodes. However, the advantages and drawbacks of such a direct process have not been discussed quantitatively. In the present work, we established a model using Aspen Plus to simulate the direct process. By analyzing the energy conversion processes in detail, it was clarified that the suppression of SOEC overpotentials at low temperatures is crucial. If the SOEC overpotentials are decreased at 400 °C, the energy conversion efficiency of the direct process will become higher than that of the conventional two-step process especially at small methane production rates. The superior performance can be ascribed to the recuperative heat utilization between the exothermic methanation reaction and the endothermic electrolysis reactions.
Introduction
The use of renewable energy can help establish a sustainable society, and has been encouraged worldwide. According to World Energy Outlook 2018 by the International Energy Agency,1 the fraction of renewable energy sources to satisfy the world's total primary energy demand was 14% in 2017. This should be increased to ca. 30% in 2040 to achieve internationally-agreed objectives on climate change, air quality and universal access to modern energy. One of the major drawbacks of renewable energy is its intermittency. Electricity generated from solar or wind power naturally fluctuates, and the fluctuation can cause instability in electric power supply networks. Various methods have been investigated so far to mitigate this problem, and among them, the concept of power-to-gas is attracting attention.2 Power-to-gas is an energy conversion technology where electrical energy is converted into chemical energy which is suitable for relatively long-term and large-scale storage. In power-to-gas processes, energy carrier gases such as methane and hydrogen are produced by utilizing surplus electricity, and then stored or transported. In particular, methane is a promising energy carrier candidate because it can utilize the existing infrastructure for natural gas.2–5 Also, carbon dioxide can be used to synthesize methane, which can contribute to a carbon-free fuel cycle.
Generally, power-to-gas processes have two steps to produce methane.2 The first step is water electrolysis to produce hydrogen, and the second step is catalytic methanation from hydrogen and COx. For the power-to-gas, various carbon sources can be used.2,6 Flue gases of industrial processes or power plants are large carbon sources across the world, so the utilization of those sources will have a significant impact. However, carbon capture and/or purification processes are needed to utilize carbon dioxide in the flue gases. At the present stage, these additional processes require much energy and may lower the overall system energy efficiencies. Other possible carbon sources are biogas and syngas from biomass gasification. Biogas is mainly composed of methane and carbon dioxide, and syngas is a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. These sources are small compared to the industrial ones, but directly applied to the methanation reaction. Consequently, recent pilot plants prefer biogas as a carbon source.6
There are several types of electrolysis cells available for the hydrogen production. Among them, low temperature electrolyzers such as alkaline electrolysis cells (AECs) and proton exchange membrane electrolysis cells (PEMECs) were developed earlier. Accordingly, most power-to-gas pilot plants have been equipped with the low temperature cells.6–8 On the other hand, solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), which are operated at high temperatures such as 800 °C, have potential to achieve more efficient systems because required electrical power for the electrolysis is decreased at higher temperatures.9 Luo et al.10 compared power-to-gas systems with four different electrolysis cells (AEC, PEMEC and two SOECs). They reported that, to produce the same amount of methane, the SOECs require lower energy inputs than the AEC or the PEMEC. Furthermore, SOECs allow the electrolysis of carbon dioxide. In the cathode feed gas, carbon dioxide can be mixed with steam, and then syngas can be obtained through electrolysis reactions (eqn (1) and (2)) and the reverse water gas shift reaction (eqn (3)). This process is called co-electrolysis. H2O + 2e− → H2 + O2−(1) CO2 + 2e− → CO + O2−(2) CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O(3)
In this case, obtained syngas can be converted into methane in catalytic reactors (eqn (4)): CO + 3H2 → CH4 + H2O(4)
Advantages of the co-electrolysis in power-to-gas processes have been discussed by several investigators.10–12 It has been shown that the power-to-gas process with the co-electrolysis can be advantageous over the process with the steam electrolysis, although it is not always the case. For example, in ref. 10, the authors conducted an exergy efficiency analysis and reported that the co-electrolysis becomes more efficient than the steam electrolysis at high current densities. Assuming a SOEC with a strontium- and magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM) electrolyte at 600 °C, they calculated achievable highest exergy efficiencies. Under a cathode inlet gas composition of H2O/CO2 = 5.27, the resultant efficiencies were 77.43% and 82.00% for the steam electrolysis and the co-electrolysis, respectively. Fig. 1(a) illustrates the two-step power-to-gas process utilizing co-electrolysis in a SOEC. Synthesized methane is introduced to the gas network and dealt with the existing infrastructure for natural gas. By connecting the power grid and the gas grid, flexible energy management can be achieved. Fig. 2(a) shows the details of the two-step process. Here, the reaction heat of methanation (M) in the external catalytic reactors cannot be directly utilized for heating the SOEC stack because SOEC operating temperature is usually around 800 °C while that of the catalytic methanation is much lower (around 300 °C). If M can be utilized for endothermic co-electrolysis reactions, the energy required in the SOEC (PSOEC) can be suppressed and the overall system efficiency will become higher.

 Fig. 2  Details of the two power-to-gas systems. (a) Two-step process: CO2/H2O co-electrolysis in a high-temperature SOEC coupled with catalytic CO methanation in a methanation unit (MU). (b) Direct process: direct methane synthesis in an intermediate-temperature SOEC. Only desired reactants and products are shown for simplicity. 
Recently, some researchers have proposed the concept of one-step power-to-gas, where the electrolysis step and the methanation step are integrated into a single SOEC reactor (Fig. 1(b)). Such a novel reactor can be economically advantageous due to the unnecessity of the external catalytic reactors. Initial investment and maintenance costs of the system could be lowered. A space-saving feature of the direct process also matches the concept to utilize the distributed renewable energy resources.
The proposed one-step reactors can be classified into two types. One is a reactor with temperature gradients, which is first reported by Chen et al.13 They prepared a tubular SOEC and made the cathode support layer and the electrolyte layer longer than the anode layer. The excess part of the cathode layer, which is located in the cooled downstream region, functions as a methanation catalyst. SOEC cathode materials can catalyse the methanation reaction because components of the cathodes are similar to those of heterogeneous COx methanation catalysts.14 In ref. 13, a reaction test was performed for 24 h with a cathode inlet gas composition of H2O/CO2/H2 = 20/11.4/68.6. The SOEC part of the reactor was kept at 800 °C while the downstream region was placed under a temperature gradient of 800–250 °C. The reactor showed a stable performance: average current density, CO2 conversion and CH4 yield were 0.42 A cm−2, 64.1% and 39.7%, respectively. In the reactor, the places for the electrolysis reactions and the methanation reaction were spatially separated, and the temperatures were also different. Therefore, heat exchange mechanism should be carefully designed to realize the heat utilization. It is suggested that a counter flow condition is preferred to a parallel flow condition to create the desirable temperature distributions.15,16 In the counter flow condition, the reaction heat of methanation in the cathode downstream region can be efficiently used to heat up the anode inlet gas flow. Luo et al.16 established a two-dimensional model and investigated the effects of operating conditions and cell materials on the methane production. They found that a cell composed of LSGM-based materials could achieve an electricity-to-gas efficiency of 94.5% at 29 bar. Based on the same concept, Lei et al.17 fabricated a micro-tubular SOEC reactor and tested it experimentally. A methane yield of 21.1% and a carbon dioxide conversion of 87.7% were achieved with a feed gas composition of CO2/H2/H2O = 10.7/69.3/20.
The other type of the one-step power-to-gas reactors is the isothermal ones. According to thermodynamics, methane can be directly formed in SOEC cathodes when the co-electrolysis is performed at low temperature and high pressure.14,18 It is supposed that hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced by the co-electrolysis further react to form methane on the surface of the cathode material. Such a power-to-gas process utilizing the isothermal one-step reactor is called direct power-to-gas process hereafter. Fig. 2(b) shows the direct process, where methane is directly synthesized in a SOEC unit. The SOEC in the direct process is assumed to work at intermediate temperatures under 600 °C, and the methanation reaction takes place inside the cell. Therefore, the reaction heat of methanation (M) can be directly utilized for the endothermic electrolysis reactions. The simplified thermal management has potential to decrease the energy required for the SOEC unit (PSOEC).
However, there are some challenges to make the direct power-to-gas process practical. First, attention should be paid to the system outlet gas compositions. Equipment designed for natural gas requires high methane concentration and low hydrogen concentration because hydrogen can deteriorate the durability of such equipment. Note that limits of the acceptable hydrogen fraction differ depending on the equipment, and there is no common agreement about the exact values.19 Here are some examples of reported upper limits: 2 vol% for gas storage tanks,19 15 vol% for natural gas pipeline network,10 and 30 vol% for internal combustion engines of natural gas-fueled vehicles.11 Most of the previous researches featuring the internal methanation in SOECs are based on the concept of reversible solid oxide cells (ReSOCs) coupled with isolated gas storage tanks (Fig. 1(c)).14,18,20–23 In those cases, the fuel gas is not introduced to the natural gas grid, so the limitations of gas compositions were not severe. However, if the utilization of natural gas infrastructure is aimed (Fig. 1(b)), those limitations have to be taken into account. Luo et al. simulated the direct power-to-gas process in ref. 10. According to their model, the product gas of the isothermal SOEC reactor operated at 550 °C and 25 bar contains 54 vol% of hydrogen, which exceeds the upper limit of acceptable hydrogen fraction in the existing natural gas infrastructure. Therefore, hydrogen removal from the product gas is needed, resulting in a system exergy efficiency lower than that of the two-step process or the temperature-gradient SOEC reactor. Reznicek and Braun24 modelled a reversible direct power-to-gas system connected to a natural gas pipeline and a carbon dioxide pipeline. When the reversible cell was operated in a SOEC mode at 600 °C, 20 bar, the system outlet gas contained 60% of methane and 33% of hydrogen. It should be noted that the hydrogen amount of 33% could be unacceptable for natural gas pipelines.10 A system lower heating value efficiency of 68.1% was reported in ref. 24 while the comparison with the two-step power-to-gas systems was not performed.
Materials development is also a problem. Methanation is a highly exothermic reaction, so it is thermodynamically advantageous to lower the SOEC operating temperature to obtain a significant amount of methane. However, today's typical SOECs are not suitable for operation below 600 °C due to the large overpotentials caused by low ionic conductivity in the electrolytes and slow reaction rates at the electrodes. Even though the idea of the power-to-gas process utilizing internal methanation in SOECs was already recognized in literature in 2011,25 only a few experiments have been reported on this topic until now.26–28 Li et al.26 conducted experiments of methane synthesis using a planar button-type SOEC in a temperature range of 550–650 °C. Methane compositions of less than 1% in the outlet gas (dry basis) were reported under ambient pressure. Corresponding current values ranged from 0 A to 1.095 A. Yamaguchi et al.27 conducted experiments using tubular type SOECs at 400 °C, 1 atm. They compared an yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte and a gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte and stated that the GDC electrolyte is more suitable at 400 °C. In the GDC case, methane concentrations around 30–40% were reported for a current range of 19–312 mA.
Performance improvement of the isothermal SOEC reactors could be achieved by applying the technologies of low- or intermediate-temperature solid oxide cells. For example, oxide ion-conducting materials such as doped bismuth oxides29,30 or lanthanum silicates31,32 have been investigated as electrolytes for lower temperatures. The performance of such electrolyte materials can be enhanced or stabilized by forming multilayered structures.33,34 Proton-conducting perovskites are also widely studied as low- or intermediate-temperature electrolyte materials.35,36 Application of those ceramics to carbon dioxide reduction has been reported37–39 while stability issues caused by the reaction between the perovskites and carbon dioxide should be settled.40
The direct power-to-gas processes with isothermal one-step SOEC reactors have never been discussed intensively, possibly due to the difficulty to overcome the limitations discussed above. As a result, the characteristics of the processes are not yet fully understood. To obtain a comprehensive view of the concept, the significance of advantages and drawbacks of the direct process should be revealed quantitatively in comparison to the two-step process. It is worthwhile to investigate the system operating conditions and SOEC properties required to make the most of the possible advantage, and to clarify how significant the impact will be.
Accordingly, in the present work, we focus on the isothermal conditions for the direct power-to-gas. We established a process model with which both the direct process and the two-step process can be simulated. First, the performance of the direct power-to-gas process was simulated with changing the operating temperature, assuming the cell properties of conventional high-temperature SOECs. For a low-temperature region, properties at higher temperatures were extrapolated. The results were compared with that of the two-step process. After that, highly pressurized operations of the direct process were simulated in expectation of improved performance. Finally, improved current–voltage characteristics were postulated for the direct-methanation SOEC at 400 °C and 500 °C. Detailed discussions about the energy conversion properties were made to reveal the problems and the potential advantages of the proposed systems. The present work is intended to offer insights into the direction of future investigations of the direct power-to-gas processes.
Theory and models
Use of process simulators in SOEC modeling makes it easier to discuss energy efficiencies in the whole system. Barelli et al.11 used Aspen Plus platform to model a system for production of CH4/H2 mixture which consisted of a SOEC unit and a catalytic methanation unit. However, the SOEC unit was only used for co-electrolysis and the direct methanation in cathode was not considered in their work. In the present study, a SOEC-based energy system was modeled so that both the direct and the two-step power-to-gas processes can be simulated in a single model. Major features of our model are the following: (1) the carbon monoxide methanation in SOEC cathode is considered. (2) Each component of the cell overpotentials can be separately calculated. The present model is basically zero-dimensional, so the distributions of temperature and gas concentrations inside the SOEC are not taken into consideration. Zero-dimensional models are widely used to simulate SOEC systems.11,12,21,41 In some of the zero-dimensional models, current–voltage characteristics of the cells are modeled by considering area specific resistances (ASR) as functions of temperature and pressure.11,12 While the ASR simplifies the calculation, such an approach limits detailed discussions of the overpotentials. In the present model, three components of the overpotential (ohmic, activation and concentration overpotentials) were calculated separately. This allows us to simulate how cell geometry parameters and electrochemical parameters affect the SOEC performance. It is necessary to consider the gas concentration gradients in electrode layers for the calculation of the concentration overpotentials. Accordingly, even though the overall model is zero-dimensional, one-dimensional gas concentration profiles in the electrode thickness direction were postulated.21,41
SOEC unit
Solid oxide electrolysis cell unit was modeled using a process simulator Aspen Plus V8.8 (Aspen Technology, Inc.). Fig. 3 shows an overview of the model. In this model, SOEC cathode reactions were simulated by two virtual reactors CATHODE1 and CATHODE2. CATHODE1 is a stoichiometric reactor which is correspondent to electrochemical reactions. Here electrochemical half reactions eqn (1) and (2) were modeled by full reactions eqn (5) and (6), respectively. (5) (6)
 Fig. 3  Model of the SOEC unit. 
The rate of each reaction was determined by considering the contributions of steam electrolysis and carbon dioxide electrolysis to the total current. The following relationship was assumed: (7)IH2 and ICO are current values correspond to the steam electrolysis and the carbon dioxide electrolysis, respectively. The sum of IH2 and ICO is defined as Itotal (Itotal = IH2 + ICO). yH2O and yCO2 are the mole fractions of each species in the cathode inlet stream (CA-IN). Parameter xI was introduced to adjust the ratio of current contributions. xI indicates the possibility of a carbon dioxide molecule to be electrolyzed while that of a water molecule is set to unity. This parameter xI is considered to reflect physicochemical factors such as gas adsorption properties and activation barriers of charge-transfer reactions. The value can depend on the experimental conditions, but it is reasonable to use values of xI ≤ 1 because the steam electrolysis is known to be more possible than the carbon dioxide electrolysis.42 O2 species generated in CATHODE1 is separated (SEP) and sent to the anode side (ELECLYTE). Then the O2 species is mixed with sweep air (AN-IN) to form O2-rich anode outlet gas (AN-OUT). Cathode gas species except O2 are introduced to the second virtual reactor, CATHODE2. This reactor calculates the Gibbs free energy minimum, which corresponds to a situation that all possible reactions go to the equilibrium. In this case, the major two reactions are the following: H2O + CO ⇄ H2 + CO2(8) H2O + CH4 ⇄ 3H2 + CO(9)
The forward reaction of the first equilibrium (eqn (8)) is called water gas shift, and the reverse reaction is called reverse water gas shift. For the second equilibrium (eqn (9)), the forward reaction is steam reforming of methane, and the reverse reaction is carbon monoxide methanation. Feedstock conversion in the cathode was calculated by the following equation; (10)where ṅini and ṅouti are the molar flow rate of species i in the cathode inlet (CA-IN) and the cathode outlet (CA-OUT), respectively. The cathode outlet gas (CA-OUT) contains a certain amount of water vapor, which is not desirable for methanation reaction. Therefore, the gas is cooled to 25 °C (CA-COOL) and resultant liquid phase is separated at VLSEP (vapor–liquid separator) before introduced into a methanation unit.
Heat recovery is also considered in the present model. Cell outlet gas flows were cooled to 25 °C (CA-COOL and AN-COOL) and it was assumed that 50% of the removed heat can be recycled to heat up the cell inlet flows (GAS-HEAT, H2O-HEAT and AN-HEAT). In actual systems, this kind of heat management can be achieved by using heating media such as high-temperature steam, or by the direct heat exchange between cell outlet and inlet flows.
Based on the above process model, information about gas compositions in each flow and energy duties in each component (heater, compressor, reactor, etc.) can be obtained. In the next section, the calculation methods for electrochemical characteristics will be described.
Current–voltage characteristics
In the present study, cell operating voltage, E, was calculated as a function of current density: (11)
Cell overpotential, η, can be divided into three components: ohmic, activation and concentration overpotentials. In the calculation of each component, operating conditions (such as current density, temperature and pressure) and cell geometries are considered.

Nernst potential. 
Nernst potential, ENernst, was calculated as follows:43,44 (12)here, are the standard Gibbs free energy changes at the reaction temperature for formation of 1 mol of H2O (g) and CO2, respectively. p is the total pressure, and yi is mole fraction of each gas species. For the calculation, averaged gas compositions of cell inlet and outlet flows were used. R is the molar gas constant, and F is the Faraday constant.


Ohmic overpotential. 
Ohmic overpotential, ηOhm, was obtained by (13)where δe is the thickness of the electrolyte. For the YSZ electrolyte, electrical conductivity σ in S m−1 can be calculated by the following equation:45 (14)kB is the Boltzmann constant in J K−1. Contributions of electrodes were ignored because the conductivity values of the electrodes are considered to be several orders of magnitude higher than that of the electrolyte.


Activation overpotential. 
Activation overpotential, ηAct, is generally expressed by the Butler–Volmer equation; (15)where α is the symmetry factor, and the i0 is the exchange current density. In the present model, cathode activation overpotential was divided into  and determined to satisfy the following equations: (16) (17)iH2 and iCO are the current densities corresponding to the water electrolysis and the carbon dioxide electrolysis, respectively, and obtained as follows: (18) (19)SSOEC is the total electrode area of the SOEC. For the anode side, the symmetry factor α was assumed to be 0.5 and the Butler–Volmer equation was rearranged as (20)
To obtain overpotentials from the equations above, values of exchange current densities were needed. According to literature, the exchange current density of the steam electrolysis in cathode  and that of the oxygen evolution reaction in anode (ia0) can be determined by the following equations:46 (21) (22)
In eqn (21) and (22), the unit for  is A m−2, and that for R is J K−1 mol−1. Note that the pressure dependences of the exchange current densities are not included in eqn (21) and (22). Here we consider the pressure dependence as follows. In general, exchange current densities of the steam electrolysis and the oxygen evolution is expressed as (23) (24)where γH2 and γO2 are constants. Partial pressures of hydrogen, steam and oxygen are related to the total pressure as pH2 = ptotalyH2(25) pH2O = ptotalyH2O(26) pO2 = ptotalyO2(27)yH2, yH2O and yO2 are molar fractions of each gas. When the total pressure increases from pItotal to pIItotal and the molar fractions are unchanged, the ratios of exchange current densities become (28) (29)
Based on eqn (28) and (29), eqn (21) and (22) are modified as follows: (30) (31)
For ia0, E = 0.25 is used in this study as is often assumed in literature.47 On the contrary, reported values of exponents A and B differ significantly among studies (see ESI†). Consequently, A + B values range from 0.23 to 3. This time, we examined two cases, A + B = 0.25 and 2, to see how the SOEC performance is affected by this factor.
The exchange current density of the carbon dioxide electrolysis in cathode (ic0,CO) was calculated from  by assuming the ratio of . Because the value of  changes depending on experimental conditions and materials of the cathode,48 was used as a fitting parameter in this study. The value was determined by fitting the literature data of co-electrolysis conducted at ambient pressure (see Model validation section). The same  value was used to simulate pressurized operations.


Concentration overpotential. 
Concentration overpotential is originated from gas concentration gradients in electrode layers. Such gradients can be explained by considering mass balances in the electrodes, which includes molecular diffusion and gas conversion by electrochemical and catalytic reactions. In Aspen Plus, the electrode processes are described by the zero-dimensional model, which does not care about the gas concentration profiles. Hence, the additional model is needed to calculate the concentration overpotentials. Here, simplification was made and linear concentration gradients from the electrode surface to the electrode/electrolyte interface were considered.
For the cathode side, the following formulae were used:49 (32) (33)αH2 and αCO are the symmetry factors in Butler–Volmer equations (eqn (16) and (17)). iL,H2 and iL,CO are limiting current densities for the steam electrolysis and the carbon dioxide electrolysis, respectively. For the steam electrolysis, a linear concentration profile of steam in the cathode layer was assumed. At the outer surface of the cathode (z = 0), the steam concentration was the same as that in the bulk gas flow, . The concentration decreased linearly along the z axis. The limiting current density, iL,H2, is the current density which corresponds to the depletion of reactant steam at the cathode-electrolyte interface (z = δc): (34)
In the case of co-electrolysis, the carbon dioxide electrolysis was also taken into consideration. The limiting current density for the carbon dioxide electrolysis was calculated in the same manner: (35)
Reactant concentrations in the bulk flow, , were obtained from the averaged gas composition of cathode inlet and outlet flows. In the above calculations of limiting current densities, effective diffusion coefficients, Deffi, were needed. They were defined as (36)where ε and ξ are the porosity and tortuosity of the electrode, respectively. Gas diffusion in electrode pores includes two mechanisms, Knudsen diffusion and molecular diffusion. Therefore, the following relationship was used to know the diffusion coefficient Di. (37)
The Knudsen diffusion coefficient of species i, DKi, can be obtained as (38)where dp is the electrode pore diameter, Mi is the molecular weight of species i in kg mol−1. For molecular diffusion coefficients, DMi, there are no established calculation methods for multi-component systems. In this study, a weighted average of interdiffusion coefficients DMi.j was used as an approximated value: (39) (40)
Molar fraction yj is based on the averaged composition of cathode inlet and outlet. DMi.j values were obtained by the Chapman–Enskog theory assuming Lennard-Jones potential.
For the anode side, there are no reactants and only the formation of oxygen molecules occurs. In this case, a formulation using limiting current densities cannot be applied. Ni et al.50 proposed the following equation by considering the oxygen permeation inside the anode layer driven by a partial pressure gradient: (41)δa is the anode thickness, and  is the oxygen partial pressure at the anode outer surface. The average value of anode inlet and outlet flows were used for . μ is the kinetic viscosity of oxygen gas, which can be calculated easily by using a six-order approximate formula provided by Todd and Young.51Bg is the oxygen permeability derived from the Kozeny–Carman relationship:52 (42)

Methanation reactors unit
In this study, we used a model of a catalytic methanation unit where three adiabatic reactors were connected in series (Fig. 4).11 When a large amount of methane is synthesized in a reactor via the highly exothermic methanation reaction, the reactor temperature will dramatically increase. To avoid an undesirably high reactor temperature which can cause catalyst deactivation, inlet gas temperature of each reactor was adjusted to 250 °C. Also, 75% of the outlet gas of the first reactor was recycled to limit the temperature rising in the reactor. The operating pressure of the three reactors was set to the same pressure as that of the SOEC unit. This methanation unit (MU) was used only in the simulations of the two-step power-to-gas process (Fig. 2(a)). As explained earlier, the SOEC cathode outlet gas was dried and then introduced to the MU. In the simulations of the direct methane synthesis in SOEC cathode (Fig. 2(b)), this MU was not included.
 Fig. 4  Model of the methanation reactors unit. 
Model validation
To check the validity of the model, experimental data presented by Li et al.26 were employed. They used cathode-supported planar button cells which consisted of Ni-YSZ cathode support layer (thickness: 680 μm), Ni-ScSZ cathode active layer (15 μm), ScSZ electrolyte (20 μm) and LSM-ScSZ anode (15 μm). ScSZ and LSM are scandia-stabilized zirconia and lanthanum strontium manganate, respectively. The diameter of their electrodes was 1.3 cm. For the calculation, the ionic conductivity of ScSZ electrolyte was determined by referring to the literature,53 instead of using eqn (14). The exchange current densities of the Ni-ScSZ cathode and the LSM-ScSZ anode were approximated by those of Ni-YSZ and LSM-YSZ, respectively (eqn (30) and (31)).
First, the parameters in our model were fitted to reproduce three current–voltage curves corresponding to H2O electrolysis, CO2 electrolysis and co-electrolysis operations at 750 °C, 1 atm. The cathode inlet gas compositions for each operation were H2O/H2/Ar = 28.6/14.3/57.1, CO2/CO/Ar = 28.6/14.3/57.1 and H2O/CO2/H2/Ar = 28.6/28.6/14.3/28.5, respectively. In all electrolysis modes, the cathode total gas flow rate was 350 mL min−1. The anode gas was fixed to air (350 mL min−1). Fig. 5 shows the fitting results. Simulated current–voltage curves are in good agreement with the reported experimental data, and differences between the three operation types are successfully described by the proposed model. The determined values for each parameter are listed in Table 1. The feedstock conversions in each operation were 6.1% at 600 mA cm−2 for the H2O electrolysis, 3.0% at 300 mA cm−2 for the CO2 electrolysis and 2.3% at 450 mA cm−2 for the co-electrolysis.

Next, using the fitted parameters, co-electrolysis operation at 650 °C, 1 atm was simulated. The cathode inlet gas composition was H2O/CO2/Ar = 28.6/14.3/57.1, and the total flow rate was 175 mL min−1. The anode inlet gas was 175 mL min−1 air. The current for the simulation was set to the same value as the reported one in the literature, then the operating voltage and the cathode outlet gas composition were calculated. Table 2 shows the comparison between the reported experimental data and the simulation results. Note that argon and steam are excluded from the list of cathode outlet gas compositions for simplicity. For both the operating voltages and the gas compositions, trends of the experimental data are successfully traced by the simulation. Calculated feedstock conversions are also shown in Table 2. The conversion is almost proportional to the current and reached 11.1% when 1.095 A was applied. Under the present co-electrolysis condition, the thermoneutral voltage of the SOEC, at which the electrical power input becomes equal to the overall enthalpy change in the cell, was calculated to be 1.32 V. This means that the cell is endothermic in the simulated cases corresponding to 0 A and 0.101 A, while exothermic in the cases of 0.676 A and 1.095 A.

Fig. 6 visualizes the cathode outlet gas compositions corresponding to polarization condition at a current load of 1.095 A. General trend of the experimental data is replicated by the simulation, while there are some discrepancies in fractions of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The discrepancy in the gas composition could be ascribed to the progress of the catalytic reactions. In the simulations, equilibrium (Gibbs free energy minimum) was assumed for the catalytic reactions. However, the equilibrium gas composition is not always achievable in actual experiments, due to a short gas contact time and an insufficient number of (electro-) catalytically active sites in the cathode of planar SOECs. In addition, there is a possibility that oxygen (air) leaks into the cathode chamber, resulting in re-oxidation of produced hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane.

Condition for process simulations
SOEC operating conditions
We considered a SOEC stack made of cathode-supported cells with the composition of Ni-YSZ|YSZ|LSM-YSZ. The thickness of the Ni-YSZ cathode, YSZ electrolyte and LSM-YSZ anode were assumed to be 500 μm, 20 μm and 15 μm, respectively. The fitted values in Table 1 were used as parameters in the model. Cathode inlet gas composition was 50% H2O, 25% CO2 and 25% N2. Steam to carbon ratio was set to S/C = 2, which follows the stoichiometry of the overall reaction formula of electrochemical methane formation (eqn (43)). 2H2O + CO2 → CH4 + 2O2(43)
Anode inlet gas was air (21% O2, 79% N2). Total inlet gas flow rate at each electrode was set to 1.0 mol s−1. Operating pressure of 5 atm was selected, and the cell current density was changed in the range of 0–1000 mA cm−2. The total electrode area of SOEC stack, SSOEC, was set to 10 m2, which allows 100 kW-class operation.
One of the main concerns of this work is the comparison between the direct process and the two-step process. In the cases of the direct process, SOEC cathode outlet gas (CA-OUT in Fig. 3) was regarded as the system outlet gas. Operations at 800 °C, 700 °C, 600 °C, 500 °C and 400 °C were simulated this time. On the other hand, the two-step process was modelled by combining the SOEC operated at 800 °C and the following methanation unit (MU). In this case, the outlet gas flow of the MU (MET3OUT in Fig. 4) was regarded as the system outlet.
Energy efficiencies
We compared the proposed systems based on system energy efficiencies. Those were calculated using lower heating values (LHV) of product gas species. LHV is defined by the enthalpy change in the complete combustion reaction of a fuel gas into carbon dioxide and steam. The values are 802.7 kJ mol−1, 241.8 kJ mol−1 and 282.9 kJ mol−1 for methane, hydrogen and carbon monoxide, respectively. In this work, two types of system energy efficiencies were introduced. One is ηCH4, which was calculated based on the LHV of produced methane: (44)
The other is ηtotal, defined as (45)where ṅi is the molar production rate of species i in the system outlet gas flow (mol s−1), LHVi is the lower heating value of species i (J mol−1), and Psystem is the total power input of the whole system (kW). For ηtotal, we took into account not only LHVCH4 but also LHVH2 and LHVCO. Methane LHV ratio, xCH4, was calculated by the following equation: (46)
The parameter xCH4 is the ratio of ηCH4 to ηtotal, and reflects the product selectivity of the system.
The system total power input in eqn (44) and (45), Psystem, was calculated as the sum of the following factors (i)–(iii).

(i) Electrical and thermal power supplied to the SOEC. 
The power supplied to the SOEC unit, PSOEC, was calculated as PSOEC = max{ΔḢSOEC, Itotal × E}(47)here, E is the cell operating voltage which is calculated from eqn (11). ΔḢSOEC is the enthalpy difference per unit time between SOEC inlet flows and outlet flows: ΔḢSOEC = (ḢCA-OUT + ḢAN-OUT) − (ḢCA-IN + ḢAN-IN)(48)
The term Itotal × E indicates the power supplied by electricity. When ΔḢSOEC > Itotal × E, the electrical power supply is not enough to carry out the desired (electro-) chemical reactions. Therefore, the deficit (ΔḢSOEC − Itotal × E) is compensated thermally. This type of a heat duty is denoted as “Cell heating” in the latter sessions. On the other hand, cooling of the cell is required when ΔḢSOEC < Itotal × E. In this case, the difference (Itotal × E − ΔḢSOEC) will become a thermal loss. This type of energy loss is denoted as “Loss (SOEC power)”. If thermal insulation of the cell is perfect, no heating or cooling is needed when ΔḢSOEC = Itotal × E (thermoneutral point).


(ii) Energy used for heating and compression of the inlet flows. 
Energy requirements of GAS-COMP, H2O-PUMP and AN-COMP were taken from Aspen Plus results. Since we assume the heat recovery with 50% efficiency, the duty for heating up the SOEC inlet flows was calculated by the following formula: QHEAT = (QGAS-HEAT + QH2O-HEAT + QAN-HEAT) − 0.5(QCA-COOL + QAN-COOL)(49)


(iii) Heat duty in the methanation unit. 
When simulating the two-step power-to-gas process, the methanation unit (MU) was installed in the downstream of the SOEC unit. As described earlier, the inlet gas temperature of each reactor of the MU was maintained at 250 °C. Generally, the reactor inlet flows are cooled to remove the excess reaction heat of the methanation. However, we have to care the case that the low current density in the SOEC produces only a small amount of hydrogen and carbon monoxide which are introduced into the MU. In the case, the reaction heat in the first reactor is small and the inlet gas temperature of the reactor becomes lower than 250 °C. Accordingly, some heat input was needed to fulfil the temperature requirement of 250 °C.

Results and discussion
We simulated two cases for the pressure dependence of the cathodic exchange current density (eqn (30)): A + B = 0.25 and 2. In this section, results are shown for the case of A + B = 0.25. The results obtained by assuming A + B = 2 are displayed in ESI.† Even though the individual values are different between the two cases, the trends of the results are unchanged.
Electrochemical properties

Fig. 7(a) shows the calculated current–voltage characteristics of the SOEC unit at 400–800 °C. It is clear that lower temperature requires larger overpotential. Fig. 7(b)–(f) represent the breakdown of the overpotentials at each temperature. At high temperatures, the main contribution to the total overpotential is the activation overpotential. As the temperature decreases, the ohmic overpotential becomes greater. These characteristics are reflected in system energy efficiencies discussed hereunder.

Details of the energy conversion in the system

Fig. 8 shows the details of energy input and output of the examined systems. Fig. 8(a)–(c) are the results of the direct power-to-gas process operated at 800 °C, 600 °C and 400 °C. SOEC current density was changed from 0 to 1000 mA cm−2. For the energy input, it is obvious that the required electric power significantly increases with lowering the operating temperature, which corresponds to the current–voltage characteristics shown in Fig. 7. As mentioned in the previous section, “Cell heating” in Fig. 8(a1) and (b1) represents the required heat to compensate the imbalance between ΔḢSOEC and Itotal × E. The value of “Cell heating” is zero in Fig. 8(c1), because the current density corresponding to the thermoneutral point at 400 °C is less than 100 mA cm−2. For the energy output, it is noteworthy that LHV values of produced hydrogen and carbon monoxide are much larger than that of methane at 800 °C (Fig. 8(a2)), while LHV of methane is dominant at 400 °C (Fig. 8(c2)). The high selectivity of methane against hydrogen and carbon monoxide is an advantage of the low-temperature operation. At the same time, the large electric power needed at 600 °C and 400 °C results in the large thermal losses in the energy output, which are denoted as “Loss (SOEC power)” in Fig. 8(b2) and (c2).
 Fig. 8  Details of the energy input and output of the examined power-to-gas systems. SOEC operating pressure is 5 atm. 

Fig. 8(d) is the result of the two-step process. In the process, the SOEC operating temperature was set to 800 °C while the inlet gas temperature of the methanation reactors was set to 250 °C. Comparing Fig. 8(a1) and (d1), total energy inputs are almost the same because the only difference is the small heat duty in the methanation unit (MU). However, energy output profiles differ significantly. One of the main features in Fig. 8(d2) is a large proportion of the methane LHV. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the SOEC outlet gas flow are converted into methane by the MU, resulting in the quite low level of H2 LHV and CO LHV in the energy output of the two-step system. It should also be noted that the loss in the energy output increased in the two-step case because the reaction heat of the methanation cannot be recovered in the MU. The corresponding portions are denoted as “Loss (MU heat)” in Fig. 8(d2).
Based on the results in Fig. 8, energy conversion efficiencies were calculated. Fig. 9(a) summarizes the relation of ηtotal and xCH4 in the direct process (400–800 °C) and the two-step process. Ten points plotted for each process indicate the results corresponding to the SOEC current density of every 100 mA cm−2 from 100 to 1000 mA cm−2. The arrows indicate the ascending order of current density: the first point is for 100 mA cm−2 and the last one is for 1000 mA cm−2. As shown in the figure, there is a trade-off relationship between ηtotal and xCH4 in the direct process. High ηtotal can be achieved at high temperatures because of the small SOEC power loss. However, methane formation is thermodynamically suppressed at those temperatures, leading to the low xCH4. In the two-step process, xCH4 values are near 100% because the fraction of methane in the system outlet gas can be dramatically increased by the methanation unit. At the same time, ηtotal values are smaller compared to those in the direct process operated at 800 °C, due to the loss of reaction heat of the methanation. Fig. 9(b) shows the ηCH4 as a function of methane production rate, rCH4. Comparing at the same rCH4, the two-step process produces methane at higher efficiencies than does the direct process.

Fig. 10 compares system outlet gas compositions obtained in each of the simulated cases with the SOEC current density of 1000 mA cm−2. Significant amounts of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are included in the cases of the direct process, while almost all products are methane in the two-step process. In the present model, equilibrium was assumed for the catalytic reactions in the cathode, and consequently the methane concentration in the outlet gas depends only on the operating temperature and pressure. When the direct process is operated at 400 °C, molar fractions of the product gas species are 79.4%, 0.9% and 19.7% for methane, carbon monoxide and hydrogen, respectively. Hydrogen fraction of 19.7% is a little higher than the allowable upper limit of the existing natural gas pipeline network10 while it could be used for the automobiles.11 To further decrease the hydrogen content, operating temperature lower than 400 °C or operating pressure higher than 5 atm is needed unless additional hydrogen separation is applied.

Improved scenarios
Pressurization
As pointed out in the previous section, pressurization is one of the approaches to achieve a higher methane concentration in the product gas. Therefore, simulations of the direct process operated at a high pressure of 20 atm were performed. The pressure dependence of the cathodic exchange current density was calculated by eqn (30) with A + B = 0.25. Fig. 11 compares the system outlet gas compositions at 5 atm and 20 atm corresponding to SOEC current density of 1000 mA cm−2. The methane production rate and its selectivity against hydrogen and carbon monoxide are increased by the pressurization at both 400 °C and 600 °C. Simultaneously, the water content is increased due to the promotion of methanation reaction (eqn (4)). At 400 °C and 20 atm, molar fractions of the product gas species are 88.6%, 0.5% and 10.9% for methane, carbon monoxide and hydrogen, respectively. Because the hydrogen fraction is almost halved from 19.7% at 5 atm, the pressurization is effective to reduce the hydrogen content. Fig. 12 shows the xCH4vs. ηtotal plot and the ηCH4vs. rCH4 plot. Changes in the product gas compositions result in the increase in xCH4 and ηCH4. However, ηtotal is almost unchanged by the pressurization, indicating that the changes in cell overpotentials are not so significant in the simulated cases. The improved ηCH4 values are still far below those of the two-step process. The present results indicate that radical improvement of the current–voltage characteristics of the cell is necessary to make the direct process comparable or even superior to the two-step process.

Improvement in current–voltage characteristics
In this section, simulation results of the direct power-to-gas process with improved SOEC current–voltage characteristics are presented and discussed. When the cell is operated at 5 atm, low temperature such as 400 °C or 500 °C is needed for the direct process to achieve a methane production rate comparable to that of the two-step process (Fig. 9(b)). Here we simulated improved scenarios where the ohmic and activation overpotentials (ηOhm and ηAct) are decreased at 400 °C or 500 °C. The concentration overpotential (ηConc) was kept unchanged. Table 3 summarizes the examined cases. For the operation at 400 °C, ηOhm and ηAct values were set to be equivalent to those of 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C and 800 °C. For the operation at 500 °C, the values equivalent to those of 600 °C, 700 °C and 800 °C were considered.

The resultant energy conversion efficiencies are shown in Fig. 13. As can be seen in Fig. 13(a) and (c), ηtotal increased with the improvement of polarization characteristics while xCH4 remains unchanged. Consequently, ηCH4 is also improved (Fig. 13(b) and (d)). In the cases of 4–5, 4–6 and 4–7, the value of ηCH4 exceeds that of the two-step process at low rCH4 conditions. In the case 4–8, ηCH4 becomes larger than that of the two-step for the whole examined region. On the other hand, in the cases of 5–6, 5–7 and 5–8, the efficiency goes below that of the two-step.

(c) and (d) SOECs operated at 500 °C with improved current–voltage characteristics. SOEC operating pressure is 5 atm. 
The reason for the superior performance of the direct process in the improved case 4–8 was further examined by analysing the energy conversion properties. Fig. 14 shows the details of the energy input and output in the case 4–8. From Fig. 14(b) and 8(d2), the SOEC power loss and the MU heat loss are specified as key factors because their behaviours to the SOEC current density are characteristic among other components of the losses. Fig. 15(a) explains those two types of losses accruing in the two-step process. For the SOEC unit operated at 800 °C, the magnitude relation of the SOEC electrical power input (Itotal × E) and the enthalpy change corresponding to the chemical reactions inside the SOEC (ΔḢSOEC) is important. When Itotal × E < ΔḢSOEC, the energy shortage is made up by additional heating. Conversely, when Itotal × E > ΔḢSOEC, the surplus will become an energy loss (Area 1). In addition to the SOEC power loss, the MU heat loss is also present in the two-step case because a certain amount of reaction heat in the methanation unit (MU) is not recovered. The amount of the MU heat loss is illustrated in Fig. 15(a) as Area 2. For example, when 400 mA cm−2 is applied to the cell, Itotal × E (44 kW) is insufficient to satisfy the SOEC heat duty ΔḢSOEC (54 kW), so the additional heating of 10 kW is needed. Nevertheless, reaction heat of 13 kW was lost in the MU and this amount was even larger than the additional heat supplied to the cell unit. Fig. 15(b) is for the direct process at 400 °C. Under the default condition, the SOEC power loss corresponds to the area between the power curve (blue line) and the ΔḢSOEC line, i.e. Area 3 + 4. If the improved scenario is taken into account, the power curve will shift to the purple line. In this case, the SOEC power loss will correspond to Area 3 only. When 400 mA cm−2 is applied in the case 4–8, the SOEC power loss is 4 kW. This is much smaller than the MU heat loss in the two-step process (13 kW), resulting in the higher ηCH4 values (48%) than that of the two-step process (44%). In other words, the concept of the recuperative reaction heat utilization takes effect in the improved case 4–8.

Conclusions
In the present work, the power-to-gas process featuring the direct internal methanation reaction in the SOEC cathode was modeled by using Aspen Plus. First, the performance of the direct power-to-gas process was simulated and compared to that of the two-step process, which consists of a serial combination of the high-temperature SOEC unit and the methanation unit. As a result, energy conversion efficiencies of the direct process were lower than that of the two-step process, mainly due to the large overpotentials at low temperatures and the thermodynamic limitation of the methane formation. After that, the operation of the direct process at a high pressure of 20 atm was simulated. The high pressure in the SOEC unit was found to be effective to lower the hydrogen content in the product gas, but the methane LHV-based energy conversion efficiency was not improved significantly by the pressurization. Finally, improved current–voltage characteristics were postulated for the SOEC in the direct process. When the ohmic and activation overpotentials at 400 °C were decreased, the methane LHV-based efficiency became higher than that of the two-step process especially at small methane production rates. The superior performance of the improved direct process was ascribed to the recuperative reaction heat utilization.
