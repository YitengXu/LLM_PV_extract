    , Accepted 30th May 2012First published on 1st June 2012AbstractHigh quality carbon nanodots (C-dots) with high purity were synthesized through a mild, one-step electrochemical approach, without the assistance of any chemicals but only pure water. This high productivity method makes the synthetic process of C-dots synthesis both economical as well as environment-friendly. The as prepared C-dots are predominantly multi-layer graphene oxide, with luminescence and high up-conversion photoluminescence (emission of light at shorter wavelengths than the excitation wavelength). Meanwhile, C-dots showed peroxidise mimetic function and visible-light-sensitive photocatalytic activity for methyl orange degradation. In addition, a novel photocatalyst (TiO2/C-dots) was obtained by combining C-dots with TiO2 through an easy hydrothermal method. Remarkably, TiO2/C-dots exhibited an excellent visible-light photocatalytic activity.
1. Introduction
Carbon nanodots (C-dots), a new form of nanostructured carbons, consist of a fascinating class of recently discovered nanocarbons displaying abundant photo-physical properties, especially the strong size- and excitation wavelength-dependent photoluminescence (PL) properties and unique up-converted PL behavior. As a consequence of the health concerns, the potential environmental and biological hazards of the traditional semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), the C-dots are attracting considerable attention as a promising alternative to semiconductor QDs in various applications due to their low-cost and intrinsic low toxicity.1,2 Followed by the laser ablation method,3 a variety of approaches have been established for the fabrication of C-dots, such as electrochemical exfoliation of a graphitic source,4 incomplete combustion of carbon soot,5 carbonizing polymerized resols on silica spheres,6 thermal oxidation of suitable molecular precursors,7 and dehydration of carbohydrates.8 However, most of these methods require complex controls, which may produce adverse effects on the product, such as poor crystallinity, impurities, intricate post-treatments, and the poor physical and chemical properties. In previous work, we presented a facile one-step electrochemical method for the synthesis of C-dots in an ethanol–H2O solution with the assistance of NaOH.2 Nevertheless, to obtain C-dots with high purity is still a tough problem due to the complicated purification and separation procedures. Consequently, a green, facile and scalable synthetic approach is highly desired for the synthesis of high quality C-dots, which can promote their further applications in broad fields such as catalysis, sensors, biological labeling, and solar cells.
Herein, we present a facile electrochemical approach for the large-scale synthesis of high quality C-dots with high purity, in which only pure water is used as the electrolyte without any other chemical additives. The as-obtained C-dots feature a high crystalline nature, excellent aqueous dispersibility, remarkable PL properties (down and up-converted PL), and require no further purification. Moreover, we further demonstrate that these C-dots possess high visible light sensitive photocatalytic activity, as well as promising components for high-efficiency complex catalyst design.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of C-dots
All chemicals were used as received without further purification. The graphite rod (99.99%, Alfa Aesar Co. Ltd.) was inserted into the ultrapure water as the anode (18.4 MΩ cm−1, 600 mL), placed parallel to the other graphite rod as the counter-electrode with a separation of 7.5 cm. Static potentials of 15–60 V were applied to the two electrodes using a direct current (DC) power supply. A detailed illustration of the experimental device used is shown in Fig. 1a. After 120 h continuous stirring, the anode graphite rod corroded, and a dark-yellow solution appeared gradually in the reactor, as shown in Fig. 1b. The solution was filtered with slow-speed quantitative filter paper, and the resultant solution was centrifuged at 22000 rpm for 30 min to remove the precipitated graphite oxide and graphite particles. Finally, the obtained solution was water soluble C-dots.

2.2 Preparation of TiO2/C-dots nanohybrids
Synthesis of the TiO2/C-dots nanohybrids entailed the dropwise addition (1 mL min−1) of Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 (Aldrich, 1 mL, 97%, dissolved in absolute alcohol with a ratio of 1:19) into C-dots solution (55 mL, 0.1 mg mL−1). After continuous stirring of the mixture for 4 h, a colloidal solution of TiO2/C-dots nanohybrids formed. The resulting solution was then sealed into a Teflon-lined autoclave, followed by hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C for 48 h. Then the as-obtained gray solid TiO2/C-dots were washed with water and ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C.
2.3 Peroxidase mimetic behavior and photocatalytic activity test
A sample (3 mL) containing 10.0 ppm of methyl orange (MO), 100 ppm C-dots adjusted pH 7 with buffer and H2O2 (3%) was placed in a quartz cell. The reaction was held at a constant temperature (298 K) and stirred all the time. There are two compared experiments, one in dark and the other exposure to visible light (150 W, Xenon lamp). MO in this reaction was quantified by the measurement of the decay of the absorbance at λmax = 465 nm as a certain of time.
2.4 Electrochemical test
Electrochemical experiments were performed with an IM6e potentiostat (Zahner Elektrik Company, Germany) in a conventional three-electrode cell. The electrode assembly consists of a platinum wire as the counter electrode, an Ag–AgCl–KCl (SCE) electrode as the reference electrode, and a glass carbon (GC) electrode as the working electrode. The measurement buffer contains 1 M KCl and 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]4−/3− as redox indicator. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was recorded in the range from −1 to 1 V with a scan rate of 0.01 V s−1. The GC electrode was prepared as follows: prior to the surface coating, the GC electrode was polished carefully with 0.5 μm and then with 0.05 μm alumina powder, followed by sonication in 1:1 nitric acid–water (v/v), acetone and in doubly distilled water successively. The surface of GC electrodes was allowed to dry in a nitrogen atmosphere. The TiO2/C-dots were ultrasonically dispersed in water to form a homogeneous dispersion (1 mg mL−1). The surface of the GC electrode was coated with 5 μL of TiO2/C-dots and then dried in air. The surface of the modified GC electrode was further coated with 5 μL of Nafion ethanol solution (0.2 wt%) and then dried in air before the electrochemical experiments.
2.5 Photocatalytic activities and photoelectrochemical test
A tungsten–halogen light with a power of about 50 W (λ: 420–2500 nm) was positioned inside a cylindrical vessel which was surrounded by a circulating water jacket for cooling. 0.1 g TiO2/C-dots, pure TiO2, P25 or 0.01g C-dots was suspended in 20 ppm methyl blue (MB) aqueous solution (100 mL) respectively. The solution was firstly stirred for 4 h to ensure the establishment of an adsorption–desorption equilibrium. The reaction system was then irradiated with visible light, with 3 mL aliquots removed at certain time intervals (30 min) which were analyzed on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer to record MB concentration.
Photoelectrochemical testing systems were composed of an CHI 600D Electrochemistry potentiostat, a 500 W xenon lamp with cut off filters (λ > 510 nm), and a homemade three-electrode cell using platinum as the counter electrode, Ag–AgCl as the reference electrode, and Na2SO4 (0.5 M) as the electrolyte. The TiO2/C-dots and P25 electrodes were prepared by depositing suspensions made of photocatalyst and absolute ethanol (the concentration of the photocatalyst is 100 g L−1) onto fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass (FTO) using the doctor-blade coating method with a glass rod and scotch tape as a frame and spacer, respectively. Electrodes were dried and then calcined at 250 °C for 3 h in vacuum. During measurements, the electrodes were pressed against an O-ring of an electrochemical cell with a working area of 3.14 cm2.
2.6 Measurement and characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was obtained by using a X'Pert-ProMPD (Holand) D/max-γA X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm). Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were taken on a FEI-Tecnai F20 (200 kV) transmission electron microscope (FEI). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was obtained by using a KRATOS Axis ultra-DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatised Mg Kα X-ray (hν = 1283.3 eV). Room temperature UV-vis diffuse reflectance absorption spectra (UVDRS) was recorded on a Lambda 750 (PerkinElmer) spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. Fluorescent spectrophotometry was recorded on FluoroMax 4 (Horiba Jobin Yvon) spectrophotometer with slit of 3 nm, and the power of the excitation light is 150 W (ozone-free Xe lamp).
3. Results and discussion
As depicted in Fig. 1a, a simple electrochemical setup was used to synthesize the C-dots. The graphite rods were used as both the anode and cathode, ultra pure water as the electrolyte without any other additives. After 120 h reaction, a dark-yellow solution (shown in Fig. 1b) consisting of C-dots and large scale graphite oxide was prepared. Notably, C-dots with distinct particle sizes were obtained by a centrifugation process. The higher the centrifugal speed, the smaller the particles that were left in the aqueous solution, the yield of the C-dots is about 16.5%. The digital image of the C-dots aqueous sample is shown in Fig. 1c, displaying its weak brown color. The zeta potential of the C-dots solution was tested to be −51.8 mV, confirming the electrostatic stabilization of the C-dots dispersion, because colloids with zeta potentials higher than 30 mV (negative or positive) are generally stable.9 The dynamic light scattering (DLS) histogram (Fig. 1d) shows that the C-dots are well dispersed with particle sizes ranging from 3 to 6 nm. Fig. 1e shows the TEM image of the C-dots, revealing that the diameters of C-dots are about 4.5 nm. The HRTEM image (Fig. 1f) exhibits the crystal lattice spacing around 0.321 nm, agreeing well with the (002) lattice planes of graphitic carbon.10,11 The minority crystal lattices of the as-prepared C-dots are observed, indicating that they consisted of several layers of graphene.12,13
For the structure measurement, we took pristine graphite (obtained by grinding graphite rod) as the comparison. The XRD patterns of the C-dots and pristine graphite are shown in Fig. 2a. The spectrum of the graphite reflects one prominent peak at 26° corresponding to the (002) planes of graphite. While for the pattern of C-dots, two new peaks emerged at 22.59° (signed with ★) and 18.20°, which refers to the amorphous carbon and (103) planes (belongs to hexagonal carbon). A detailed comparison of the C-dots samples reveals that the electrochemical oxidation process leads to weak, broadened graphite peaks compared to pristine graphite samples. The decrease in the peak intensity indicates the transformation of crystalline graphite into amorphous structure carbon, and the partial conversion of sp2-hybridized CC in the aromatic ring into sp3-hybridized CC in the C-dots2,12,13 The increase of the full width half maximum (FWHM) is due to the small size of the resultant C-dots. The Raman spectra (λex = 633 nm) of the C-dots and pristine graphite are shown in Fig. 2b. For graphite, three prominent peaks are exhibited at 1345, 1570 and 2696 cm−1, corresponding to the documented D, G and 2D peaks, respectively. While for the as-prepared C-dots, only two prominent peaks at 1350 and 1600 cm−1 are displayed, and the 2D peak disappears. The intensity ratio of the D and G band (ID/IG) is a measurement of the disorder extent, as well as the ratio of sp3/sp2 carbons. In our case, the graphite has a weak ID/IG ratio of 0.365, but after electrochemical oxidation, the C-dots showed a noticeable increase in ID/IG ratios of 1.234. During the graphite oxidation, some structure defects appeared in the C-dots, such as oxygenated groups (C–O, CO, O–CO) in the sp2 carbon site, and then vacant lattice sites and sp3 carbons were produced.

Fig. 2c shows the XPS spectra of C1s, from which we can see that from graphite to C-dots, the peak intensity (located at about 288 eV) has a noticeable increase, indicating more oxidation groups (C–O, CO) appeared in C-dots, which is consistent with the Raman results. Fig. 2d shows the FT-IR spectra of graphite and C-dots. Three peaks located at 3485.67 (a, hydroxyl OH), 1632.96 (b, aromatic CC) and 1384.09 cm−1 (c, O adsorption on graphite C∼O) are observed in the FT-IR spectrum of graphite, while for the C-dots, seven peaks located at 3442.19 (d, hydroxyl OH), 1710.28 (e, carboxy CO), 1444.42 (f, aromatic CC), 1243.79 (g, epoxide/ether C–O–C), 865.59 (h, aromatic Ar–H), and 606.55 cm−1 (i, aromatic Ar–H) are found. The appearance of the new peaks for the C-dots correspond to the oxygen-containing groups and other new functional groups, indicating successful oxidation of graphite and the formation of hydrophilic groups. On the basis of the above results, we can conclude that the oxygen functional groups are formed through the electrochemical oxidation, and the sp2-hybridized CC in aromatic ring in graphite are partially decomposed into oxygen functional groups in the C-dots.
A detailed PL study was carried out to further explore the optical properties of the as-synthesized C-dots. The PL spectra with excitation wavelengths from 300 to 900 nm are shown in Fig. 3a. A closed observation shows that some PL emission peaks can be extended into the near infrared wavelength range. The PL in such carbon systems is a consequence of geminate recombination of localized electron–hole pairs in sp2 clusters, which essentially behaves as the luminescence centers or chromophores.14 Furthermore, a detailed study reveals that with the excitation wavelength at 700, 750, 800, 850, 900 and 950 nm, the corresponding emission spectra of the C-dots show an up-converted property (Fig. 3b). It is implied that the C-dots would be used as a powerful energy transfer component in biology applications or photocatalyst design.2

Interestingly, we found that the C-dots have peroxidase mimetics activity, which have been studied and applied in environmental chemistry, such as to remove phenols from wastewater.15 To investigate the peroxidase mimetic activity of the C-dots, the degradation of MO dye was examined in the presence of H2O2. Fig. 4a reveals that there was no MO degradation when H2O2 was mixed with MO (adjusting pH 7 with buffer). However, a significant degradation (160 min, 23.6%) of MO was observed in the presence of C-dots, indicating the peroxidase mimetic function of C-dots. The catalytic properties of the C-dots could be explained by the formation of an activated transition complex [C⋯H2O2], which can transfer electron density from the π-system of the C-dots to the peroxide molecule during the decomposition process of H2O2.16 Particularly, a better catalytic activity of the C-dots was achieved when this reaction system was exposed to visible light. As shown in Fig. 4b, MO could be photo-decomposed completely within 80 min in the presence of C-dots. For C-dots, the conduction band is the antibonding π* orbital.17 The efficient photocatalytic ability of C-dots on MO photodegradation can also be attributed to the fact that C-dots can be well dispersed in water and the C atoms on the carbon sheets of the C-dots are therefore accessible to protons. So H2O and H2O2 can be readily transformed into ˙OH, which possess a high oxidation ability during photoreaction.17 These ˙OH active species can recover oxidation ability after catalytic reaction by accepting photogenerated electrons from C atoms.

In the following experiments, we prepared TiO2/C-dots nanohybrids (wt%: C–TiO2 = 24.22%) with the as-obtained C-dots, and investigated the photocatalytic properties of the nanohybrids. Fig. 5a displays the TEM image of the as-prepared TiO2/C-dots nanohybrids. The HRTEM image (insert in Fig. 5b) exhibits the junction detail and the excellent crystalline structures of TiO2 nanoparticles and C-dots, indicating that the spherical TiO2 nanoparticles and C-dots have been nicely combined after hydrothermal treatment. The finely merged fringes confirms the modification of the C-dots on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The well-resolved lattice fringe with an interplanar distance of 3.54 Å corresponds to the TiO2 (101) plane, and the lattice spacing of around 3.21 Å is assigned to the carbon (002) plane. The digital image of the TiO2/C-dots solution shown in Fig. 5c clearly exhibits the gray product. The XRD pattern of the nanohybrids (Fig. 5d) corresponds to a typical diffraction pattern of anatase phase TiO2 as cross-referenced to a JCPDS: 71-1167. The well-separated diffraction spots in the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (insert in Fig. 5d) reveal the single-crystalline nature of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The BET surface area of TiO2/C-dots nanohybrids was measured to be 127.09 m2 g−1, indicating that these nanohybrids are fairly small and have a large surface area. Base on these results, we can define the TiO2/C-dots as a “dyade” structure,18–20 where the combination of two parts gives a rise in synergistic properties arising from the beneficial interaction of the two.

Typical UVDRS clearly displays the band gap absorption onset of P25 located at about 380 nm (Fig. 6a, black curve), while TiO2/C-dots show an efficient absorption in the visible band, implying their good photocatalytic ability under visible light (green curve). The blue curve, corresponding to the physical mixture of TiO2 and graphitic powder (with the weight ratio equal to TiO2/C-dots), is quite different from that of TiO2/C-dots. It is strongly confirmed that the UVDRS of the TiO2/C-dots is not merely the overlap of TiO2 and graphitic powder, and one part of the absorption over the 400 nm wavelength belongs to the real adsorption of TiO2/C-dots. The UV/Vis absorption spectrum of C-dots is also shown in Fig. 6a. The onset peak located at about 300 nm represents a typical absorption of an aromatic pi system, which is similar to that of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.2 In order to further put insight into the chemical interaction between TiO2 and C-dots, CV measurements on TiO2/C-dots, C-dots, P25 were carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 6b. We can see that the oxidative potential of TiO2/C-dots shifts negatively by about 160 mV compared to that of P25, suggesting the better oxidative ability of TiO2/C-dots than P25.21

In view of the high specific surface area, high chemical activity and high visible light sensitivity, herein, we performed the photo-degradation of MB and a photovoltaic cell test to evaluate the visible light photo-catalytic activity of pure TiO2, C-dots and TiO2/C-dots, respectively. Fig. 7a shows the time-dependent concentrations of MB exposed to visible light using different photocatalysts. As shown, the as-obtained TiO2/C-dots are able to completely degrade MB within 4 hours, and P25 and C-dots show slight degradation efficiencies (17.5% and 29.4%). While pure TiO2 does not show any degradation of MB under the same irradiation conditions. Meanwhile, transient photocurrents (Fig. 7b) of TiO2/C-dots and P25 were tested under the irradiation with wavelengths longer than 510 nm. When irradiated with wavelengths longer than 510 nm, the TiO2/C-dots show the highest photocurrent (−2.24 μA cm−2) compared to that of P25 (0 μA cm−2), which is in good agreement with the UVDRS spectra of TiO2/C-dots exhibiting the widest and highest visible optical response.

Based on the above results, we can see that the C-dots can significantly increase the catalytic and photoelectrical activities of TiO2 due to the bonding and interaction between the C-dots and TiO2. Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) spectra are used to analyze the binding energy (BE) edges of different samples (Fig. 8a and b), showing that the BE of TiO2/C-dots (17.24 eV) is higher than that of TiO2 (17.20 eV, 10 nm, prepared with the similar method with that for TiO2/C-dots in the absence of C-dots) and C-dots (17.22 eV). Based on this value, the work function (Ø) of the TiO2/C-dots, TiO2 and C-dots obtained from hν = BE + Ø are to be about 3.98, 4.02 and 4.00 eV, respectively. These values are so close that electrons can transfer from the C-dots to TiO2 easily, indicating that the TiO2 band gap is clearly smeared out to longer wavelengths.18 This assumption is also proved by the higher surface photovoltage of the TiO2/C-dots (5.4 mV) than that of pure TiO2 (0.73 mV) under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm).

The possible mechanism for the better photocatalytic performance of the TiO2/C-dots is illustrated in Fig. 8c, which can be described by the following three features: firstly, the approach of C-dots hybridization with TiO2 extends the response to light of TiO2 into the visible range of the solar spectrum due to the electronic coupling between π states of the graphite-essential C-dots and conduction band states of TiO2. Meanwhile, due to the electronic coupling between the π states of the graphite-essential C-dots and conduction band states of TiO2, the nanohybrids band gap will become narrow compared to the pure TiO2 or introduce new carbon energy levels in the TiO2 bandgap for effectively lowering the bandgap energy.22,23 Then, a red-shift of the light, which can excite the electrons to transfer to the conduction band, is reasonable. In addition, the up-conversion properties of the C-dots will transfer the long wavelength irradiation light into the shorter wavelength emission light2 (Fig. 3b). So light with a wider range of wavelengths, from UV to visible, can be used by TiO2/C-dots. In addition, O2 absorbed on the surface of the C-dots can accept e− and form O2− which then oxidizes MB directly on the surface. Secondly, C-dots can combine with TiO2 efficiently to form TiO2/C-dots, which can generate a great deal of photoreactive species (O2− and ˙OH) under visible light.2 Then, these photoreactive species can diffuse easily in reactants and products during the reaction because of the high surface area of the TiO2/C-dots. Thirdly, when the TiO2/C-dots photocatalysts are excited, C-dots can act as an electron reservoir to trap electrons emitted from TiO2 particles due to the irradiation of visible light, and thus hinder electron–hole pairs’ recombination probability. The C-dots can serve as an electron scavenger to avoid the process of electron–hole recombination.23,24
4. Conclusions
In summary, we report a facile, additive-free electrochemical approach for the preparation of C-dots (3–6 nm) with only ultra pure water in the reaction system. It has been found that these C-dots show the peroxidase mimetic behavior and photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, we have demonstrated the fabrication of a new hybrid photocatalyst (TiO2/C-dots) through a hydrothermal route, which exhibited higher transient photocurrents (−2.24 μA cm−2) and enhanced their photocatalytic activity under visible-light. The novel photocatalysts further confirm that the C-dots can significantly enhance the photocatalytic and chemical activity of TiO2. Future work will focus on the applications of these TiO2/C-dots hybrids in environment or energy areas, and the functionalization of other nanomaterials (SiO2, MnO2, Fe3O4, SnO2, and CuO etc.) with the as-prepared economical C-dots.
