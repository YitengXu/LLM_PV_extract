In our last Update we discussed in considerable depth the analytical developments for investigating functions and metabolism of elements in biological systems i.e. metallomics. This included methods for speciation and for surface analysis/visualization. The importance of this topic and the increase in research activity with the clinical and other areas is such that a new Atomic Spectrometry Update has been commissioned to review the current literature. This Update, with the title Elemental Speciation, will be published in the August edition of Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry. We will continue to draw attention to important features particularly as they apply to the content of this Update without necessarily providing as much detail as in recent years. Several recent technical and instrumental developments were shown to be usefully applied to the analysis of biological specimens. An unusual device described as a multiple microflame quartz tube atomizer has been further improved and was used to detect As species by HG-FAAS. A system for AES, involving HPLC and a particle beam/hollow cathode, was used to separate and determine non-protein bound Fe and Fe-proteins. Output from the column went to an interface with a thermo-concentric nebulizer, heated spray chamber and a momentum separator, to remove eluent solvent vapours and produce a beam of dry particles which entered the hollow cathode glow discharge source for vaporization, excitation and emission. This maintains optimal chromatographic conditions without having to make compromises because of problems associated with solvent entering an ICP. A miniaturized AF spectrometer to determine hydride forming elements, described as a ‘lab-on-a-valve’, was used to measure As in hair and rice. The device consisted of a dielectric barrier discharge atomizer with an integrated arrangement for HG, gas-liquid separation, atomization and detection. With a 0.5 mL sample the LOD was 0.03 µg L−1 for As. This portable instrument could revolutionise vapour generation analysis if its potential is fully realised. Methods for producing chemical vapours with Cu and Zn were demonstrated and applied to analysis of waters and biological RMs by AFS and AAS. Breath condensate was proposed as a new sample type applicable for monitoring occupational exposure to Cr while salivary As concentrations were shown to reflect drinking water levels. A useful study presented the changes in concentrations of metals in tissues stored in formalin for long periods of time. Elsewhere it was reported that, if samples are stored at very low temperatures prior to investigation for As species, then only metabolic intermediaries with AsV are found, suggesting that AsIII analogues are artefacts. Nevertheless, methods for measuring AsIII species continue to be reported, keeping this controversial issue open. Parallel work reveals yet more Se species in nature, especially in yeasts and plants. An increasing number of applications involving XRF were seen yet again during this review period. The writing team would welcome feedback from readers of this review and invite you to complete the Atomic Spectrometry Updates questionnaire at http://www.asureviews.org.

1 Reviews
The number and scope of reviews of instrumental techniques and applications seen during the last year has increased compared with previous years. These include the comprehensive review of developments in the analysis of clinical and biological materials, foods and beverages1 published as part of the series of Atomic Spectrometry Updates.2–6
With the rapid increase in the analytical developments available to investigate functions and metabolism of elements in biological systems i.e. metallomics a new Atomic Spectrometry Update has been commissioned to review the current literature. This Update, with the title Elemental Speciation, will be published in the August edition of Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry. In our last Update1 we discussed this topic in considerable depth covering methods for speciation and for surface analysis/visualization. We will continue to draw attention to important aspects of metallomics, particularly as they apply to the content of this Update, without necessarily providing as much detail as in recent years. Two appropriate reviews to mention are those by Hasegawa and Sanz-Medel et al. Sanz-Medel and co-workers7 provided a detailed account of how MS-based proteomics has developed during the last ten years and has contributed to basic biological research. Hasegawa8 presented a summary of both multi-element measurements and speciation techniques, with examples of how mercury may be bound to proteins and of the metabolism of an As-containing anti-cancer agent.

In a review of techniques available to measure minerals and trace elements in clinical specimens, Becker et al.9 drew on their experience to provide a lucid account of how isotope ratio measurements may be used successfully. They used examples of tracer experiments, ID studies and nanoflow injection devices to illustrate work with conventional ICP-MS. Determination of metals in proteins separated by gel electrophoresis and isotopic imaging of thin sections or single particles were cited as applications of LA-ICP-MS. A similar account of new applications of inorganic MS was given by Richards et al.10 These workers referred to the newer ionisation techniques of ESI and MALDI as applied to evolving topics such as screening for metabolic disorders and tracing drugs and their metabolites. Parsons and Barbosa11 applied their considerable expertise to summarise how ICP-MS is increasingly used in clinical laboratories – a trend which will have been realised by regular readers of the Atomic Spectrometry Updates. While nowhere near as widely employed, AMS provides a niche role in biomedical and pharmaceutical studies as described by Cheah and Koh.12 These authors suggest that developments in miniaturization and analysis rate will help to overcome the problems associated with high cost and size of current equipment. Methodologies for measuring specific elements were also discussed. Pharr and Jones13 addressed the extraction and enrichment of Cd in urine, which they claimed was necessary because of the very low concentrations and the complexity of the urine matrix. The role of EDXRF to studies of Pb metabolism, particularly in bone, was reviewed by Chettle and colleagues,14 one of the small number of teams who have developed and applied this technique which has featured regularly in the ASU. Morjesson and Mattssoni15 reviewed work carried out in Sweden from 1970 to 2005 in which in vivo XRF was used to determine retention of As, Au, Cd, Pb and Pt in bone and kidney following occupational or therapeutic exposure. Speciation and measurement of Mn,16 Pt (as cisplatin)17 and V18 were reviewed, together with accounts of the biological activity of these elements. Two further reviews reported on recent work relevant to silicone breast implants. Semple19 found similar Si concentrations in the human milk and blood of women with or without such implants. They also stated that much higher concentrations were present in cows' milk. As the manufacture of the silicone polymer requires a Pt catalyst there is a possibility that recipients of implants may be exposed to the metal. A report on this topic by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was evaluated by Maharaj20 who suggest that some of work used by the FDA in compiling their report may have been influenced by financial interest.
Projects to understand the mode of action of metal-containing drugs, such as protein binding studies, influences on target molecules, in which capillary electrophoresis was employed, were reviewed by Hartinger and Keppler21 who also referred to how results may be used to develop new drugs and to alternative separation methods.
In a review of techniques to determine toxic metals in food for regulatory purposes, Capar et al. discussed topics such as contamination control, sample preparation, and analytical techniques.22 They noted that analysts must be prepared to continually introduce new procedures in order to achieve lower LODs and to cope with increasing numbers of foods. Sample preparation techniques were the focus of a review by Korn et al.23 who concluded that, while dry ashing and acid digestion are widely employed, slurry sampling and direct analysis of solid foods are also important, offering high sensitivity and rapid measurement for screening purposes. Metals, particularly Cu and Fe contribute to yeast metabolism necessary for brewing and also to the flavour of beers. It is now appreciated that the metal species, rather than the total concentrations that are important. The speciation and determination of metals in beers24 and wines25 were discussed in reviews by Pohl. The effects of metal contaminants in wine, and methods for their measurement were reviewed by Catarino et al.26
2 Metrology, interlaboratory studies, reference materials and reference ranges
A group of 15 national metrological institutes and expert laboratories participated in an interlaboratory trial to assess their ability to accurately measure SeMet and total Se in selenised-yeast supplements.27 Considerable variation in techniques for sample preparation and measurement were described and, from the results it was concluded that two-step enzymatic hydrolysis prior to HPLC-ICP-MS or methanesulfonic acid extraction for HPLC-ICP-MS, both employing species-specific ID-MS, represented the best available procedures. Nevertheless, despite the varied procedures, there was good agreement among the participant's results and the expanded uncertainty of 10% is likely to represent the best that is achievable for any interlaboratory study. Parsons et al. also reported on an interlaboratory study. This work was to determine variation in measurements of Pb in bone by K-shell XRF. Samples of bone from lead-dosed goats were sent to ten participants, with 15 analytical systems tested.28 Large differences were reported indicating that this technology requires further development before laboratories can give comparable results.
Following the publication by the European Commission of maximum admitted levels of Cd and Pb in offal, Forte and Bocca29 validated a method using SF-ICP-MS to determine these elements. At 3.5 and 2.0 ng g−1 for Cd and Pb, respectively, the LODs were considerably below the statutory levels. The repeatability, intra-laboratory reproducibility and uncertainties of the method were also acceptable for monitoring foods such as kidney, liver, lung and heart. Samples available in the Italian market contained very low concentrations of these elements. Working from the same Department, Frazzoli and Bocca measured As, Cd and Pb in a powdered milk CRM, again using ICP-SF-MS.30 The method validation data were used to calculate the measurement uncertainties for these elements. This procedure was applied to analyses of cow's milk and infant formulas.
Inagaka et al.31 report on the preparation and certification of the MeHg concentration in a cod fish CRM from the Japanese National Metrological Institute. Certification was achieved by a species specific ID-GC-ICP-MS procedure, with 202Hg-enriched MeHg as the spike compound. Two extractions methods (KOH/MeOH and HCl/MeOH) and two derivatization procedures (ethylation and phenylation) were performed to avoid any biases associated with each analytical step. The method included a double ID to minimize uncertainty and a high purity MeHg solution was used to achieve traceabilty. The certified value for MeHg is 0.58 ± 0.02 mg kg−1as Hg. Preparation of candidate CRMs for Pb in bone was described by Hetler et al.32 The bone material, obtained from the same herd of lead-dosed goats mentioned above,28 was cleaned, defatted, broken into small pieces and then ground to a fine powder.

Five SRMs with differing concentrations of Hg species, prepared from either lyophilised or fresh frozen fish tissues, were analysed with a single-spike or a double-spike, speciated ID procedure. The samples were prepared by alkaline microwave digestion, ethylation and GC-ICP-MS. With the single-spike method inconsistencies between lyophilised and fresh frozen materials suggested that some species transformation occurred during the sample preparation that could not be explained. These were compensated for by the double-spike approach which provided reliable data for total, inorganic and MeHg concentrations.33
Compared with our recent Updates, there were fewer studies reporting this review period on reference ranges with clinical specimens or foods. Clark et al.34 reported values in blood, serum and urine samples from adult oyster growers living on the Canadian west coast. Concentrations of Hg and Pb in blood, Ni and Se in serum, and Mn in urine were higher than seen in other populations. Some gender differences were also noted. They observed that the results were associated with certain components of the diet, particularly spinach, seaweed, offal and shellfish.
3 Sample collection and preparation
3.1 Collection and storage
Metals such as Co, Cr and Ni are known to be skin sensitizers and cause allergic dermatitis in affected individuals. In order to understand better the mechanisms involved, a procedure to monitor skin exposure has been developed by Liden et al.35 This involved acid wipes to extract metals from fingers and palms of the hands and was applied to individuals with occupational exposure. Nickel tended to be present in higher amounts than other metals and fingers were more contaminated than palms. It was suggested that the amounts of Ni found with locksmiths, carpenters and cashiers was sufficient to induce allergic dermatitis.
The possibility of trace elements leaching from formalin-fixed tissue has been studied on a number of occasions. The results of these investigations tend to be contradictory, possible because there has been little consistency with regard to tissues examined and elements determined. Gellien et al.36 return to this topic to examine human and rat brain immersed in formalin for periods ranging from a few weeks to several years. They measured 19 elements and found that while the formalin content of some remained unaltered others increased by more than 100-fold, thus confirming that there is no simple conclusion to this particular issue. To investigate storage of hair and nails in packaging often used for this purpose, samples were kept for 6 weeks and 6 months and then various isotopes determined. There were no apparent alterations to the isotopic abundances of 2H and 18O but 13C levels changed as did 15N at 6 weeks. It was speculated that packaging should be securely sealed for isotope ratio MS.37
3.2 Extraction and digestion
Two reports feature UV-assisted digestion. Pulsed UV induced laser photolysis and H2O2 were used by Lagunas-Solar et al.38 to generate radicals which reacted with food samples in water to digest the organic material. The efficient process reduced digestion time compared with conventional acid-based methods. It was also stated to enhance recovery and analytical sensitivity (PIXE and XRF). Manjusha et al.39 combined H2O2, HNO3 and UV radiation to effect a complete digestion of vegetables, nuts and flour for determination of Se. Accurate results were obtained for three CRMs. Inagaki et al.40 devised a digestion procedure to remove Mo which causes an interference when measuring Cd by ICP-MS. Grain samples were digested using HNO3, HF and HClO4 and then purified 6 M NaOH was added. This produced Mg(OH)2 and other colloidal hydrolysis compounds. The Cd, in the form of hydroxides, adsorbed onto the colloid whereas the Mo did not. The colloid was separated by centrifugation and the Cd dissolved in 0.2 M HNO3. Recovery of Cd was reported as greater than 97% while 99.9% of the Mo was removed. With the purified 6 M NaOH extremely low blanks were obtained. The method was validated by analysis of two CRMs. Measuring Al accurately in biological tissues has always been a problem due to difficulties with contamination control. Various digestion procedures have been used and compared in the past. Bohrer and colleagues add to this with a comparison of the acid digestion of tissues with or without preliminary drying (65 °C for 24 h) and with or without fat extraction.41 Drying was preferred giving lower blank values, because less acid was necessary. No Al was detected in the lipid fractions.
Aluminium also has to be measured in dialysate concentrates to ensure that contaminated solutions are not used to treat patients with renal failure. The very high salt content of 35-fold concentrates makes the analysis particularly difficult. Komarek et al.42 set up a continuous flow extraction, forming either acetylacetonate or 8-hydroxyquinoline chelates which were extracted into IBMK. The operating parameters, flow rates, coil lengths etc. were optimized and gave 100% recovery. The LOD was 0.3 µg L−1 with an ETAAS method. Extraction of Pb from digested biological samples, to allow isotope analysis, was investigated by Tamiya and Yoshinaga.43 Solid phase extraction with a polyamino-polycarboxylic acid resin gave 94% recovery of Pb from bone with removal of more than 99.9% of the Ca. However, Pb recovery from blood at 89% was unacceptable. They found that an alternative chelating resin with a divinyl benzene/methacrylate base gave better results. Although simpler than acid digestion, methods using TMAH are generally less popular. The simplicity of this approach was demonstrated again by Batista et al.44 Samples of nail, 10–20 mg, were left overnight at room temperature in 1 mL 25% TMAH. The resultant solution was diluted to 10 mL with 1% v/v HNO3 and then the Cd, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were measured by ICP-MS.

Ultrasonication and high pressure systems to promote extraction while maintaining the integrity of analyte species, have featured in our recent Updates and further applications were reported in the last year. Sanz et al.45 employed both techniques to prepare samples of rice, straw, soil, hair and nails for measurement of As species. The samples were collected from an As-affected region of West Bengal. In two almost identical papers, Arain and co-workers describe how they used an ultrasonication method to extract As, Cd and Pb from the edible portions of fish.46,47 They set up experiments to optimize sample mass, sonication time and temperature and reagent volumes. Validation of the method was carried out with liver and dogfish muscle CRMs. Using a very similar approach, Lavilla et al.48 measured As, Ni, Se and V in fish and shellfish. They, too, optimized the analytical parameters and validated the method with CRMs. An ultrasonication-assisted extraction of four As species from cereals into 1 mol L−1 H3PO4 and 0.1% (m/v) Triton X T-114, with no interconversion and with an efficiency of more than 90%, was reported by Reyes et al.49
3.3 Preconcentration
Few innovations for sample enrichment were described in the last year. Pacheco et al.50 reported that L-methionine on controlled pore glass could be used as a solid phase adsorbant for VV. This was used in an on-line column in conjunction with an ultrasonic nebulizer for ICP-AES. Urine samples were taken to pH 9 to convert all V (total V) to the VV form or to pH 5 to measure just the VV. Trapped metal was eluted with 10% HCl. The procedure afforded a total enhancement factor of 900 i.e. 10-fold from the nebulizer and 90-fold from the adsorbant, giving an LOD of 0.008 ng L−1. These authors used the same column to separate SeIV and SeVI, with the SeIV trapped when the sample was at pH 3.51 The Se was measured using ETAAS and with an enrichment of 20-fold the LOD became6 ng L−1. A similar procedure, using oxine on surfactant-coated alumina was used by Dadfarnia et al.52 for preconcentration of Tl, with up to 77-fold enhancement. A range of sample types were analysed including hair and nails. The system could also be used for speciation. Applications of cloud point preconcentration,53,54 functionalized amberlite55 and liquid–liquid extraction56 were variations on established themes. Suleiman et al.57 used black stone (Pierre noire) as yet another solid adsorbant and determined the optimal parameters for its use in an on-line column for ICP-AES. With a 72 s sampling period a 20-fold enrichment factor was achieved for Cd, Co, Ni and Pb in urine. The review of methods to preconcentrate Cd in urine13 was mentioned above.
4 Progress with analytical techniques
4.1 Mass spectrometry

4.1.1 ICP-MS. 
A few interesting developments for measurements using ICP-MS have been reported in the last year. A trend towards improving throughput with more efficient sample introduction is evident and Mahar et al.58 described a system consisting of an autosampler, switching valve, high efficiency PFT-ST nebulizer and a Peltier-cooled cyclonic spray chamber. In addition to increased analysis rate and lower reagent consumption, this provides for some reduction of memory effects and increased stability as demonstrated by reference to measurement of Hg and analysis of samples with high dissolved salt, in drinking water and wastewater. Performances of a micronebulizer-desolvator system and a MicroMist cyclonic spray chamber, for ICP-MS where the sample material is limited, were evaluated by Pozebon et al.59 The former system gave superior sensitivities and LODs. Minnich et al.60 employed a large bore direct injection high efficiency nebulizer to measure As, Cd, Hg and Pb in urine. Compared with a pneumatic nebulizer and cyclonic spray chamber, small sample volumes were required and memory effects were reduced although the sensitivity, LOD and precision deteriorated a little. Accuracy of results was demonstrated by analysis of samples from external quality assessment schemes.
Problems associated with entry of HPLC solvent into the ICP are compounded when a method requires solvent gradient chromatography. Cuyckens et al.61 used species-unspecific ID to compensate for changes in solvent concentration in a method to measure Br in faecal extracts.
Lam and Salin62 used inductive-heating ETV to vaporize elements from sub-microgram amounts of hair. Signal profiles were the same for either powdered hair or hair strands. Thus hair CRMs were shown to be suitable for calibration purposes whereas liquid solutions were not. The sensitivity permitted single hair strands to be analysed. A tungsten boat furnace was used for ETV-ICP-MS measurement of Br and I in biological samples.63 This procedure was adopted to overcome a decrease in ionization efficiency of the analyte ions caused by water mist. Inclusion of TMAH as chemical modifier prevented loss of Br and I during the sample drying step. Taking a sample volume of 95 µL, detection limits of 8.1 pg mL−1 and 0.91 pg mL−1 were obtained for Br and I, respectively.
An ICP-MS method to measure As, Cd and Hg in emulsified vegetable oils, with the sample introduced as a vapour, was reported by Chang and Jiang.64 Emulsions were prepared with 10% oil – 2% Triton X-100 – 1.2% HCl, and an FI system was used for transferring into the vapour generator. Results obtained by this method, using either, standard additions or ID for calibration, gave results that agreed with those obtained by pneumatic nebulization following acid digestion.

Technology for LA-ICP-MS was employed by Pozeban et al.65 to measure Pt along a single strand of hair taken from a patient treated with cisplatin. A total ablation approach was used for maximum sensitivity. The method was calibrated using hair enriched with Pt. Peak concentrations of 14.7–26.9 µg g−1 corresponded to discrete episodes of treatment. Ballihaut and co-workers66 used a high repetition rate femtosecond laser to give increased sensitivity for LA-ICP-MS detection of selenoproteins separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Compared to a nanosecond laser system the sensitivity was enhanced by at least 40-fold.
As reported in previous Updates, a research group in Taiwan have established a technique to perform real-time in vivo sampling and analysis of brain extracellular fluid. The earlier work using anaesthetized rabbits has now been extended with work on rats and analysis by ICP-MS.67 A new microdialysis unit was developed with a carbohydrate membrane desolvator to remove the salt matrix. The brain perfusate, at a rate of 0.5 µL min−1 was collected for 10 min into a sample loop and then mixed with EDTA to form anion complexes, Na+ exchanged with NH4+ across the desolvator and the sample then passed to the ICP-mass spectrometer where various trace and major elements were measured. The system was tested by administration of MnCl2 or cisplatin to the rats.
The section above on sample collection and preparation contains details of work relevant to isotope analysis and De Maynck et al.68 reported on the use of MC-ICP-MS to determine 208Pb:206Pb ratios in infant bones from a Roman settlement in the Netherlands from the 1st to 3rd century AD. Analysis of bones, soil and spices suggested that the bone Pb was probably derived from various sources.
Lanthanide elements have not been shown to have important biological or nutritional importance. Analytical methods and investigative studies are uncommon. Malik et al.69 have developed two methods and demonstrated that low concentrations may be determined by ICP-MS. They used capillary electrophoresis and showed that they could separate lanthanides which had been previously extracted from samples. The ICP-MS sensitivity, however, was inadequate to detect the ng g−1 levels in mussel tissue. For their second procedure, a micronebulizer-desolvation system was used for sample introduction. With considerably reduced oxide formation the LODs were much lower and the lanthanide metals were measured satisfactorily.
In our last Update,1 we included a report of a conference presentation describing a retrospective adjustment applied to urinary Cd data to correct for the previously unrecognised interference by Mo. This work has now been published71 and may usefully be read together with that of Inagaka et al.,40 (see section 3.2). While many laboratories successfully measure Cd, Hg and Pb in blood with relatively simple diluents, McShane et al.72 recommend a solution with 0.25% TMAH, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.01% APDC, 1% isopropanol and 10 pg L−1 Ir. This method has been transferred to US State laboratories as part of an emergency response programme.


4.1.2 Other MS techniques; AMS. 
There is very little to report. Cheah and Koh12 highlighted how the sensitivity provided by AMS, to 10−18 mol L−1 levels, make it a valuable technique to follow biomarkers of interest over long time periods. It is particularly suited to metabolic, kinetic, toxicokinetic and dosimetric studies where isotopes such as 26Al, 14C, 41Ca and 3H can be traced. Examples include studies of DNA-adduct formation in carcinogenesis and the metabolism of drugs. In a separate article, Lappa and Stevens73 also discussed how AMS, with its exquisite sensitivity, could be used to follow small amounts of 14C-labelled drugs and provide data on pharmacokinetics and metabolism.
For further and detailed discussion of developments in atomic mass spectrometry readers are referred to the companion Atomic Spectrometry Update.2

4.2 Atomic absorption spectrometry

4.2.1 Flame AAS. 

Thermospray flame furnace AAS continues to evolve and a procedure to determine Se in biological tissues was developed by Rosini et al.74 Samples were digested and an aliquot of 600 µL, at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min−1, was carried in a water stream to the hot Ni tube. The LOD was, for FAAS, an impressive 8.7 µg L−1. Hernandez-Zavala et al.75 referred to a “multiple microflame quartz tube atomizer (multiatomizer)” which was used to detect As species by HGAAS.
An FI system which included a column of oxine on surfactant-coated alumina was used to achieve a 77-fold preconcentration factor and to speciate Tl in water, hair, nail and other sample types by FAAS.52 Volumes of 25 mL, containing EDTA, were passed through the column to trap TlI which was then eluted with 500 µL 1 mol L−1 sodium thiosulfate. When hydroxylamine hydrochloride was added to the sample, TlIII was reduced to TlI to measure total Tl. The trueness of results produced by this procedure was shown by analysis of CRMs, recovery studies and comparison with ETAAS and the LOD was 2.5 µg L−1.
An FAAS method to determine Cd and Pb in drinking water, which provided LODs of 0.077 µg L−1 and 1.05 µg L−1 respectively, was developed by Portugal et al.54 The analytes were concentrated by cloud point extraction using 2-(2-thiazoylylazo)-p-cresol and Triton X-114.
A historical review of vapour generation devices to improve sensitivity of FAAS was prepared by Ataman76 and is discussed in section 4.4. A crude approach to speciation of Cu, Fe and Zn is serum, using FAAS, was reported by Hu et al.77 Serum proteins were precipitated by addition of cold 60% EtOH, with the so-called “free ions” retained in the supernatant. Neither fraction was properly characterized and it is likely that the precipitate will trap some ions and metals complexed with small ligands such as amino acids.


4.2.2 Electrothermal AAS. 
Moreira et al.78 conducted a comparison of longitudinal and transversely heated graphite tubes, grooved, integrated and forked platforms and atomization temperatures, using the measurement of Cd in blood as a model assay. Interferences, matrix effects and LODs were monitored to assess the performance of the various systems. The interactions between these components were complex but some general conclusions were that; better performance was associated with transversely heated tubes, the integrated platforms provided slightly poorer sensitivity, and the LODs were better with higher atomization temperatures. Arrangements to measure urinary Cd and Pb were investigated by Husakova et al.79 who compared 11 chemical modifiers and either Zeeman-effect or deuterium background correction systems. The objective was to establish conditions which would allow accurate measurements using deuterium correction. For Cd, NH4F suppressed any interference from Cl− while for Pb a mixed Pd–Sr modifier permitted a pyrolysis temperature of 1200 °C, reducing the non-atomic absorption to a level which could be corrected. The LODs were 0.07 µg L−1 and 1.15 µg L−1, for Cd and Pb, respectively.
Some unusual methods or novel modifiers were reported. Burguera-Pascu et al.80 constructed an FI system to determine Zn in saliva. The manifold diluted 10 µL sample with a solution of Triton X-100 which was then fed into a laboratory-made sampling arm assembly. An aliquot of 20 µL was then injected onto the atomizer platform for measurement of Zn. The timings of the sampling, injection and atomizer heating programme were computer controlled to ensure synchronicity. Mercury in gentamicin and in fish and seed oils was measured using 2.5% N,N-hexamethylene dithiocarbamic acid, hexamethyleneammonium salt in IBMK as diluent. With pyrolysis and atomization temperatures of 400 °C and 800 °C, respectively, there was little background absorption.81 Addition of a Bi internal standard compensated for interferences associated with the matrix of vinegar samples, during the measurement of Pb.82 This method made use of Ru as a permanent modifier but also included Pd–Mg(NO3)2 co-injected with the sample.

4.3 Atomic emission spectrometry
Instrumental or technical developments relevant to clinical, biological or food samples were few in the last year. Brewer and Marcus83 developed a particle beam/hollow cathode (PB/HC) emission device as an AES detector. For the PB/HC measurement, output from an HPLC column went through an interface with a thermo-concentric nebulizer, heated spray chamber and a momentum separator, to remove eluent solvent vapours and produce a beam of dry particles which entered the hollow cathode glow discharge source for vaporization, excitation and emission.
Applications which included analyte preconcentration prior to analysis by ICP-AES were mentioned in section 3.3. Cernohorsky et al.84 determined 10 elements in wheat flour and flour-based oven-ready foods using a slurry sampling technique. A 0.1% suspension was prepared in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 6% HNO3. Wheat and rice-flour CRMs were analysed to demonstrate accuracy and results from real samples were similar when prepared using this method or by complete digestion.

Whole blood, plasma and cells were analysed by Daftis and Zachariadis using ICP-AES.85 For each of the elements measured, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni and Pb, wavelengths were evaluated for sensitivity, linearity and accuracy, and the plasma conditions were optimized. The use of standard additions was the preferred calibration technique.
4.4 Vapour generation procedures and atomic fluorescence spectrometry
Rizea et al.86 linked a Perkin Elmer MHS-10 to a detector designed for measuring atmospheric Hg concentrations. This CVAAS analyser was used to determine Hg in acid digested fish tissue and used the absorption line at 184.9 nm to obtain the best sensitivity. To measure Hg in a range of biological CRMs, Dittert et al.53 digested samples with H2O2 and HNO3 and then used a cloud point extraction procedure to increase the sensitivity of a CVAAS method. Inorganic, methyl, and ethyl mercury compounds in rice and wheat flour were separated by HPLC with a C8 column and 0.5% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol and 5% v/v methanol, pH 4.7, as the mobile phase.87 Eluted compounds were reduced by NaBH4 and HNO3, and vaporized into an ICP-mass spectrometer. The LODs, for the original samples were 0.003–0.006 ng Hg mL−1. A CVAFS method was developed to determine total and organoHg in seafoods.88 The organoHg was oxidised by addition of potassium persulfate and heating in a laboratory-made electromagnetic induction heater and magnetic induction heating column. The total Hg was then measured. Inorganic Hg was determined in a sample that had not been heated and organoHg was calculated as the difference between the two results. The detection limits for inorganic and organoHg were 0.036 µg L−1 and 0.043 µg L−1, respectively.
While vapour generation methodology is usually applied to the measurement of Hg or the recognised hydride forming elements two groups showed that other metals may also be measured with this approach. He et al.89 demonstrated that Cu will form a chemical vapour. Biological CRMs were digested and the resultant solutions treated with KBH4 and 1,10-phenanthroline. The vaporized Cu was then determined by AFS with an LOD of 4 ng mL−1. Zinc in water and other sample types was also measured as a vapour.90 Nitric acid and hydroxylamine hydrochloride solutions were added to samples via an FI manifold, followed by NaBH4 reduction. The chemical vapour then went to an electrically heated quartz tube for measurement by AAS. The LOD was 0.2 ng mL−1.
Another possibly original procedure was described by Jiang et al.91 who measured Ge in rice by AFS. The optimum conditions for the chemical vaporization reaction were found to be with 2.5% KBH4 in 0.5% KOH and 20% H3PO4 – 5% H2SO4. Continuing the theme of novel developments, the tungsten-coil atomizer, used by Jones and colleagues in various ways in recent years has now been exploited by another group. De Souza et al.92 constructed an FI system in which hydrides of As and Se were generated and collected onto a Rh-coated double layer tungsten atomizer for determination by ETAAS. With a 30 s trapping time the LODs were 110 ng L−1 and 35 ng L−1 for As and Se, respectively. Ataman reviewed 30 years of developments introduced by his own group and other workers in which various atom traps, from the slotted quartz tube to tungsten coil atomizers, have been used with vapour generation techniques to enhance the sensitivity of AAS. As there are variations in features such as sampling times he proposed a number of novel terms to describe performance, so that different procedures may be more directly compared.76
A portable, robust, simple to use analyser based on a miniaturized AF spectrometer was build by Yu et al.93 This innovative design was described as a ‘lab-on-valve’ and consisted of a dielectric barrier discharge atomizer with an integrated arrangement for HG, gas-liquid separation, atomization and detection. With this new design, the gaseous hydride was swept into the atomization chamber (3 × 4 × 50 mm) where free atoms were formed in the dielectric barrier discharge area and then transported to the detector (8 × 8 × 12 mm) for excitation by incident radiation from a hollow cathode lamp. All aspects of the equipment and the operating parameters were investigated and optimized. The trueness was shown by analysis of rice and hair CRMs. With a 0.5 mL sample the LOD was 0.03 µg L−1 for As, which matches that given by large commercial instruments, and a sampling frequency of 80 h−1 was achieved.

4.5 X-ray fluorescence and surface analysis/imaging

4.5.1 
            In vivo XRF. 
Using in vivo bone data to inform or modify models of Pb metabolism has been cited in previous Updates. A review of current understanding, highlighting the complexity of Pb kinetics between body compartments, was presented by Chettle and his colleagues.14 The relevance of the extent of exposure and age of the individual were noted. The review of 30 years experience in Sweden with measurements of Cd, Hg and Pb using in vivo XRF was mentioned in section 1.
The number of centres able to undertake in vivo XRF measurements is gradually increasing and evidence of technical developments and new applications are regularly produced. Zoeger and colleagues from centres in Austria and Germany used confocal SR-microXRF to determine the location of Ca, Pb, Sr and Zn within bone and cartilage of human joints.94 Results were matched with back scattered electron images so that the anatomical source of the XRF signals could be accurately located. The Pb and Zn were seen to be co-localized at the calcification front between calcified and non-calcified cartilage and may, therefore, be associated with osteoarthritis. As much of the work is still directed towards Pb in bone, it was considered timely to undertake an interlaboratory comparison study to assess the analytical agreement among laboratories.28 This was achieved by distribution of bone samples from Pb-exposed goats and the disturbing results obtained were discussed in section 2, above.
Concerns relating to the poor analytical precision at low concentrations of Pb in bone, and the subsequent calculation to give a quantitative result, caused Popovic et al. to perform additional statistical testing on data sets to test the reliability of the calculations usually employed.95 They then concluded that the further methods of statistical analysis gave valid information but the outcomes did not differ from those given by the standard methods.
In a massive study involving more than 3000 subjects, measurements of Pb in bone were compared with cognitive function and MRI scans to show brain volume. The groups were subjects with former occupational exposure to organoPb compounds, current or former occupational exposure to inorganic Pb and normal environmental exposure to Pb. Higher bone Pb was seen to be associated with poorer cognitive function and lower brain volume and that these effects were persistent even after exposure ceased. The authors suggest that age-related cognitive decline may be a consequence of previous exposure to toxic agents such as Pb96
While Pb in bone remains the most popular application for in vivo XRF measurements, other work is progressing. Hansson et al.97 suggested that it may be possible to determine I in the thyroid gland but expressed caution in relation to standardizing measurement geometry. They prepared Monte-Carlo simulations investigating source and detector collimator apertures and the depth of the gland in the neck. The data indicated that incoherently scattered radiation may contribute to the I Kα photons and it was concluded that measurement geometry must be controlled and that corrections be made for photon scattering in the neck. Studinski et al.98 undertook a feasibility study to assess whether Ag and As could be measured in skin. Results indicated that concentrations below 10 ppm could be detected, which might be expected to be found in subjects with undue exposure. They were sufficiently encouraged to state that further studies should be pursued. A group from the same laboratory discussed in vivo XRF and dual-photon absorptiometry as techniques to measure Sr in bone.99 They suggest that these techniques uniquely have the potential to provide information on the concentration of Sr in bone, its retention and elimination. In a second publication they describe how Monte-Carlo simulations were used to assess coherent normalization for 125I-source XRF. Of the conditions studied, the coherent peak at 35.5 keV would correct for variability in finger bone size between people but a procedure is required to determine the thickness of overlying soft tissue.100


4.5.2 XRF for surface analysis and imaging. 
Localization of Cu and other elements in breast cancer tissue and of Ca and Zn in osteoarthritic cartilage and bone were demonstrated by Geraki et al. using microbeam SRXRF.101 The spatial resolution was 18 µm and scanning electron microscope images were used to confirm the sites of accumulation of elements. A resolution of 10 µm was reported by Bradley et al.102 who used a benchtop SRXRF analytical microscope to map metal ion distribution in bone and cartilage. Increased concentrations of Sr and Zn were seen at the interface between mineralized and non-mineralized cartilage. This accumulation was also observed when some of the samples were analysed by PIXE. Carmona et al.103 sought to determine the subcellular distribution of Fe in cultured dopaminergic cells with good spatial resolution. The cells were prepared by freeze-drying and a combination of PIXE, backscattering spectrometry and scanning transmission ion spectrometry used to detect and measure the Fe. A concentration of Fe at the distal end of cells suggested an association with the neurotransmitter vesicles. A similar association between Zn and expression of the zinc transporter-3 in mouse brain was demonstrated by Shen et al.104 using SRXRF. Higher concentrations of the metal and the protein were seen in cortex and hippocampus compared with other regions of the brain.
A PIXE-tomography system was used to show the three dimensional quantitative distribution of Ca, Cl, Fe, K, S and Zn along a strand of hair and to compare the results with those determined by INAA.105 Mazel et al.106 wished to determine if blood was present in the patina of art objects obtained from Mali. They used TOF-SIMS to show any protein and whether there was haem. If there was a suspicion that any haem had degraded, they then used microXRF and microXANES to demonstrate protein and Fe together to prove the presence of blood in these African artefacts.


4.5.3 Quantitative analysis. 

The prostate contains very high concentrations of Zn compared to most other tissues and there is much interest in the possible involvement of the metal in prostatic pathology. Cortesi et al.107 added to the evidence in an analysis of needle biopsy specimens using XRF and finding low Zn levels where the histological findings indicated the presence of cancer. Several recent reports have shown that measuring Zn concentrations in prostate tissue may help to differentiate between benign hyperplasia and cancer. Kwiatek et al.108 investigated samples from patients with hyperplasia using SRXRF with a 15 µm beam diameter. Concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn were increased, and S was decreased, compared with normal tissue suggesting that other elements may also be indicative of pathology.
Changes to trace element concentrations in cancerous tissue and in plasma of patients are regularly described although it is not clear whether these perturbations are involved with the development of disease or are a consequence. To add to this body of information, Carvalho et al.109analysed cancerous and normal tissue by SRXRF, EDXRF, TXRF and PIXE. There was good agreement between the results given by these techniques but data were inconsistent for the tissues. Twelve elements were measured in normal and tumour tissue from 30 patients with hepatocellular cancer, using PIXE.110 Metalloproteins from cytosol and microsomes from the same sample types were separated by electrophoresis and the metal contents determined by SRXRF.111 Energy dispersive XRF with a 125I source was used by Da Silva et al.112 to investigate the Sr content of tooth enamel. The validation of the analysis demonstrated that mass attenuation of the Ca and Sr X-rays allowed a probing depth of 1.8 mm. It was found that the precision of Ca measurements, rsd of 5.7% RSD, was good enough for normalization of the Sr signal to that of the Ca. Accuracy of the Sr results was confirmed by analysis of some samples by ETAAS. The Sr concentration in tooth enamel was 42–301 ppm (n = 42).
Elemental concentrations in lyophilised rat brain slices, from animals who received drinking water with100 ppm sodium arsenite for 30 and 60 days, were determined using microscopic SRXRF scanning and conventional XRF analysis.113 Concentrations of As correlated with the period of exposure.

In our last Update1 we discussed how the parallel approaches of separation, usually by HPLC, with ICP-MS for detection and quantification, and structural identification using ESI-MS was being used by a few research groups to investigate the metabolism of Se in yeast. It is now evident that these techniques are being applied to other elements and samples. Yuan et al.114 found that the concentrations of As species in saliva correlated with drinking water As, and were also significantly correlated with the incidence of skin lesions. The mean concentrations (µg L−1) from 301 subjects exposed to As from drinking water were: AsIII 2.8, AsV 8.1, MMA 0.8, and DMA 0.4. They concluded that saliva was a suitable sample for monitoring As exposure. To study the metabolism of a Br-containing antituberculosis drug, Cuyckens et al.61 prepared MeOH extracts of faeces collected from dogs and rats who had been given this new pharmaceutical agent. Isotope dilution analysis was chosen to compensate for changes in sensitivity of the ICP-MS associated with the HPLC gradient buffer and to aid ESI-MS identification of the metabolites among the other compounds present in the extracts. In in vitro studies, formation of adducts between cisplatin and non-nuclear components of cells were seen with a combination of SEC-ICP-MS and ESI-MS.115 Mono-aquo and oligomeric derivatives of cisplatin were identified and these reacted with glutathione and metallothionein.
Continuing with the work on Se-rich yeast, Dernovics and Lobinski116 reviewed recent publications and were unimpressed by the data relating to concentrations of SeCys. They took a number of di- and tri-peptides which contained SeCys and a specially synthesised carbaminomethyl-selenocysteine (with the structures confirmed by ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS), subjected them to proteolytic digestion and analysed these by HPLC-ICP-MS. It was found that enzymatic digestion does not fully liberate all of the SeCys and recommended that for accurate quantification the sum of Se-glutathione tripeptides should be used. Further work involving Se species in yeast is discussed in section 5.3.21 below and in the Elemental Speciation Update to be published in the August Issue of JAAS.
Most methods for speciation involve chromatography with ICP-MS. A new anion-exchange medium was used by Murko et al.117 to separate proteins to which Al was bound. Following preliminary SEC to remove low Mr Al species, a portion of the eluate was injected onto a convective-interaction media diethylamine fast-monolithic disc. Elution from the disc using a gradient buffer mixture with coupling to an ICP mass spectrometer separated and measured the Al-containing proteins in 10 min, which is faster than with LC columns.
Wolfe et al.118 mixed gastric and lung fluid samples with the mobile phase containing tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, EDTA and MeOH. Trivalent Cr complexed with the EDTA and was rapidly separated from CrVI and both species were measured by ICP-MS with NH3 as the reaction gas to remove 40Ar12C.
Hemstrom et al.119 investigated a number of organic solvents to determine which were most effective for hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) when coupled to ICP-MS. The application of interest was the speciation of cisplatin and they set out to identify a solvent which gave low solvent vapour loading of the ICP, low deposition of C within the instrument, good sensitivity and good chromatographic performance. It was found that 1,4-dioxane best fulfilled these criteria.

Mercury species were extracted from samples of flour and fish into a solution of 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol and 5% MeOH, pH 4.7, which was the mobile phase used for HPLC with a C8 column.87 Separation of Hg2+, MeHg and EtHg was achieved in less than 5 min and the eluent went to a nebulizer/vapour generation system for measurement by ICP-MS. Flour and dogfish liver CRMs were analysed to verify the accuracy of the procedure which had LODs of 0.02–0.06 ng g−1.
In the interlaboratory comparison study mentioned in section 2, HPLC-ICP-MS, GC-ICP-MS and GC-MS methods were employed to isolate and determine SeMet in Se-enriched yeast tablets.27

Well established HPLC-ICP-MS procedures for As speciation were applied to rice, hair and nails45 and to urine,120 for separation of Se species in bio-fortified grains,121 and to investigate binding of Pt to plasma proteins122
Methods that did not involve HPLC-ICP-MS were also reported. Huang et al.123 developed a different methodology to separate Se species in environmental and biological specimens. Samples were passed through a column containing nanoparticles of Al2O3 which adsorbed SeIV and SeVI. The eluent, containing organic Se compounds was passed to a second column, of TiO2 modified by dimercaptosuccinic acid, which effected separation of SeMet and Se-cystine. Inorganic Se retained on the first column was eluted with 0.2 mol L−1 NaOH, and run through the second column to separate the SeIV and SeVI. Measurements were made by ICP-MS.
Naranmandura and Suzuki124 reported a procedure that involved SEC, anion exchange chromatography, SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS to identify an As-binding species in plasma. Gel filtration of samples from rats treated with AsIII indicated a binding protein of approximately 90 kDa which was shown to contain DMA(AsIII). Electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS demonstrated a complex containing the DMA, haptoglobin and an α-haemoglobin chain.
Using AFS for detection and measurement, Slejkovec et al.125 separated and measured As species in urine and blood from cancer patients treated with As2O3. During periods of treatment, total As concentrations were at µg L−1 and ng L−1 levels in urine and blood, respectively. Separation of As species was achieved by HPLC with a Hamilton PRP-X100 column but the main focus of this work was concerned with changes that might take place during storage and analysis. When urine was stored without any preservative and in liquid nitrogen there were no significant amounts of AsIII-metabolites. With blood and plasma, the sum of the species was less that the total concentration and it was suggested that there may be some loss of As-proteins due to precipitation during the solvent extraction (blood) and to retention on the column (plasma). The authors therefore recommended caution when interpreting results.
The most useful alternatives to chromatographic separation of species involve electrophoresis. Nguyen and Moini126 linked CE with ESI-MS to look at protein-protein and protein-metal complexes in red cells. Lysed blood was diluted in CH3COONH4 and incubated for 6 h before injection. Very specific operating conditions were required to achieve good electrophoretic separation. ‘Polybrene’ was added as a self-coating reagent and forward polarity CE was established to prevent acid production at the capillary tip. Carbonic anhydrase I and II, and haemoglobin A were detected. Depending on the conditions used for the CE, the haemoglobin tetramer tended to disaggregate into dimers and monomers although this was prevented with the forward polarity.
Michalke et al.127identified how Mn is carried in the circulation and then within the CSF, in an attempt to understand how the metal enters the brain. Using SEC to give some preliminary data, they then employed CZE-ICP-MS to identify the species in CSF. Several carriers in the range of 640–680 Da were seen, with Mn-citrate accounting for about 25% of the total CSF Mn concentration. Seven Mg species were seen in rat plasma following CE-ICP-MS. One was identified as Mg2+, one as an albumin complex and others associated with different proteins.128 Using a similar procedure Ru, administered in a new anti-cancer agent, was almost entirely associated with albumin with just minor fractions in other proteins.129

Solid phase extraction using oxine on alumina to preconcentrate and separate TlI from TllII, with measurement by FAAS, was discussed in section 4.2.1.52 Pacheco et al.50 used L-methionine on controlled pore glass to similarly separate V species in urine50 and Sei species in parenteral nutrition fluids.51 Total V was adsorbed at pH 9.0 while at pH 5.0 only the VV was retained. Similarly, at pH 3 SeIV is trapped on the column. The trapped ions were eluted with 10% HCl and measured (see section 3.3).

Some interesting and novel arrangements for detection and measurement of separated species were reported. Brewer and Marcus83 described a project to investigate techniques to separate and determine non-protein bound Fe and proteins with Fe such as transferrin and myoglobin. They compared SEC and RP-LC to effect the separation and then used either ICP-AES or a particle beam/hollow cathode (PB/HC) emission device (see section 4.3) for detection. Separations were similar with either column type. This application demonstrated the advantage of the PB/HC as an emission source i.e. the ability to maintain optimal chromatographic conditions without having to make compromises because of problems associated with solvent entering an ICP, and low signal-to-noise.
There continues to be discussion as to whether or not As-metabolites containing AsIII are formed in vivo or whether they are artefacts from the analytical procedures. Hernandez-Zavala et al. have previously described an HGAAS method which includes steps to separate AsIII- and AsV-species in biological samples. In further work,75 they have automated the procedure and used a multiple microflame quartz tube atomizer (section 4.2.1 above) for an improved LOD. With an enzymatic in vitro methylation reaction and cultured rat hepatocytes, they were able to prepare AsIII- and AsV-species which were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the separation procedure. With the improved sensitivity, they were able to detect DMA(AsIII) separately from AsIII-species.
5.2 Multielement applications
Some developments in the application of the techniques to clinical and biological specimens, foods and beverages are described in the following sections and in Tables 1 and 2.

5.2.1 Biological fluids. 
Analyses of biological fluids in a number of clinical conditions were reported with some interesting results. Changes in concentrations of 13 elements in red cells and plasma following removal of dental amalgam were measured by ICP-MS in samples from 250 subjects whose quality of life had previously been self-assessed as negative, zero or positive. A number of changes were observed but relevance of this to well-being was not clear.130 Release of Cr, Fe and Ni from orthodontic appliances was investigated by analysis of saliva using AAS.131 Three types of appliance were studied and samples were collected prior to insertion then at 10 min, 1, 7, 30 and 60 days thereafter. Increased concentrations of Cr and Ni were found immediately after placement. There were no differences in amounts released by the different types of appliance.
Exposure to cigarette smoke is epidemiologically associated with pancreatic cancer and to investigate whether any of the metals present in the smoke might be indicative of pancreatic carcinogenesis, pancreatic juice was collected from 35 patients with the cancer, 30 with chronic pancreatitis and 35 control subjects. Concentrations of Cr, Mo and Se were associated with pancreatic cancer, which may be important for diagnosis, treatment or prevention of the disease.132
A study of the possible involvement of metals in Parkinson's disease was undertaken with the involvement of 42 patients and 20 control subjects.133 Both ICP-AES and ICP-SF-MS were used to measure 26 elements in cerebrospinal fluid. Reduced concentrations of Cr, Fe and Pb were seen in the patient's samples and it was proposed that these may be predictors of the clinical condition.


5.2.2 Hair. 
To avoid digestion of hair, Ferreira et al.134 prepared a slurry for measurement of Cu and Zn using FAAS. Sample material was prepared by cryogenic grinding and sonication. Sample weight, HNO3 concentration and volume, and sonication time were all optimized and, with the established conditions, the LODs were reported as 53.3 and 88.3 ng g−1 for Cu and Zn, respectively. The group who investigated CSF from Parkinson's disease patients also analysed hair samples collected from 81 patients and 17 age-matched controls using ICP-MS. The Pb concentrations were significantly lower in hair of patients while Mn levels were slightly increased. It was also reported that Ba and Sr concentrations were higher in women than in men (for both controls and patients) and that concentration of these elements decrease with age in the patients.


5.2.3 Neural tissues. 
The group of Becker et al. at the Research Centre Jülich, Germany, have developed a special interest in using LA-ICP-MS for imaging and quantitative mapping the distribution of elements within thin sections. This is presented in an authoritative book135 and in research publications. Recent work includes examination of normal and diseased brain.136,137 Thin sections (20 µm thickness) of a human brain hemisphere were scanned across a raster area of 200 mm2 with a focused laser beam creating a crater diameter of 200 µm and the distributions of Cu, Pb and Zn were demonstrated. While Pb was more evenly distributed and at ng g−1 concentrations, Cu and Zn were co-localized in specific regions with highest levels, 15 µg g−1, in the hippocampus.136 To examine sections of rat brain tumour, the laser beam provided a crater diameter of 50 µm and images of C, Cu, Fe, P, S and Zn were prepared. The tumour outline was evident by the lower C content compared with the surrounding healthy brain. Concentrations of Cu and Zn were slightly higher while Fe, P and S were low in the tumour, compared with those in normal tissue.137
Wills et al.138 proposed that changes in Cu and Zn in the human retina occur in response to accumulation of Cd with age. To investigate, they determined these elements in different areas of the retina from human eyes of subjects aged 1.5 to 87 years. Results indicated different concentrations in particular locations and changes with age with both increases and decreases as a function of age, depending on the area. Sex-related differences were also seen. The authors concluded that Cu and Zn were associated with Cd accumulation and with gender and that further investigations should be undertaken.
Lyophilised rat brain slices from animals given 100 ppm of sodium arsenite in drinking water for 30 and 60 days showed a dose dependent accumulation of As, reduction of Cl, Fe and K together with changes in their spatial distributions, while Cu and Zn were redistributed.113 Measurements were made by micro SRXRF scanning and conventional XRF analysis.


5.2.4 Bone and teeth. 

The interface between cartilage and bone in human joints was studied using SR-microXRF and backscattering electron imaging. Concentrations of Ca, Pb, Sr and Zn through the tissues were matched to structural features displayed by the imaging.94 Accumulation of Pb and Zn at the calcification front hints that there may be involvement in osteoarthritis. New bone formation around TiAlV alloy bone screws was examined by Guibert et al.139 using PIXE and backscattering imaging. Depth profiles for Ca, Cu, Fe and Zn were determined and showed that new bone formed to a depth of 300–400 µm with a high Zn:Ca ratio and increased vascularization.
Cucina et al.140 considered the process involved in analysing dental enamel by LA-ICP-MS. A tooth is sawn through to provide a flat surface, a procedure which would damage important archaeological samples. Where a tooth has been naturally fractured the inner enamel can be accessed and, if suitable for analysis, would obviate the need for further damage. These workers looked at a tooth with both a fracture and a saw cut and showed that the LA-ICP-MS results were not different. To investigate mineralization processes at the tooth surface, where tartar accumulates, Abraham et al. made a horizontal cut through teeth and measured the elemental profiles (As, Br, Ca, Cu, K, P, Sr, V, Zn) along a path through the dentine-cermentum-tartar interfaces by SRXRF. The distribution of Ca, Cu, Hg, and Zn in teeth that had had amalgam restorations in place for more than 20 years, were determined by XRF and XANES.141 High concentrations of Hg and Zn were detected in the tooth several millimetres from the amalgam, indicating migration into the organic matrix. The results raise the notion that exposure to Hg from dental amalgam may occur via another route in addition to evaporation or erosion.


5.2.5 Other tissues. 

Almost all the work discussed in this section was undertaken using XRF or related techniques, emphasising the increasing importance of these methodologies to biological multielement analysis. In liver from patients with haemochromatosis the distributions of Cu, Fe and Zn, when assessed by EDXRF, were similar to those of normal tissue. However, the concentrations of Cu and Fe were increased while Zn, together with P and S, was decreased.142 Copper in small liver tumours was increased compared with the surrounding normal tissue but, as the cancer grew in size, the Cu content reduced.110 Comparison of the concentrations of 11 other elements showed differences between tumour and normal tissue for Ca, Cl, Co, Fe, Mn, Rb and Zn. Liu et al.111 demonstrated that the distribution of metalloproteins was different between normal liver and tumour tissue and were generally depleted in the cancer cells.
Falkenberg and various colleagues reported the distribution of Ca, Cu, Fe and Zn in breast carcinoma. They found that Ca, Cu and Zn were accumulated in cancer cell clusters while the Fe content was more variable.143 The copper oxidation state was investigated by microXANES. Normal and tumour tissue contained mixtures of Cu ions. In a second report, these results were again presented together with work involving osteoarthritic lesions in an equine joint, similar to that in human material (see section 4.5.1) from a group which included some of the same authors.101 Increased concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn were shown to reflect the degree of prostate hyperplasia.108

5.3 Progress for individual elements

5.3.1 Aluminium. 
Bohrer et al.41examined various digestion methods for the quantitative determination of Al in tissues using ETAAS. They investigated acid digestion before and after tissue drying and fat extraction. Tissue drying was carried out in a conventional oven at 65 °C, whilst a range of solvents and solvent mixtures were examined for fat extraction. All digestions were performed with ultra-pure HNO3 or HNO3–HClO4. The authors considered that drying prior to digestion was advantageous as the amount of acid required was reduced. Aluminium was not detected in any fat extracts indicating that Al did not accumulate in this tissue compartment.
Murko et al.117 reported a new analytical method for the speciation and quantitative determination of Al in serum. Proteins were separated in two steps; low Mr species were first separated from high Mr species using SEC and the proteins subsequently separated on a weak anion exchange diethylamine monolithic disk. Separation of proteins was achieved by linear gradient elution from 100% 0.05 M Tris-HCl – 0.03 M NaHCO3 to 100% 1 M NH4Cl. Over 90% of Al in spiked serum from renal dialysis patients was eluted in the transferrin peak. The authors considered the monolithic disk offered faster separation and sample manipulation than more conventional column separations. Forsgard et al.144 also presented a method for separation and determination of Al containing biomolecules. Their method employed LC coupled to both ICP-MS and ESI-MS-MS to separate and quantitatively determine Al-siderophore complexes. Interference on the determination of 27Al from 12C14N1H was overcome by the use of nitrogen-free mobile phases and cool plasma conditions.
The risk of Al intoxication resulting from contaminated kidney dialysates continues to stimulate development of analytical methods for Al. Komarek et al.42 determined Al in dialysate concentrates using ETAAS, following continuous flow solvent extraction of Al with either acetylacetone or 8- hydroxyquinoline. An LOD of 0.3 µg L−1 was reported. Aluminium concentrations of 5–6 µg L−1 were determined in a selection of commercial dialysis concentrates.


5.3.2 Arsenic. 

Arsenic has emerged again as the primary element of interest in this review period, with much of the work continuing to investigate the environmental As disaster in India and Bangladesh. Jarrett et al.145 described a simple rapid method for the quantitative determination of total As in urine using ICP-DRC-MS. The authors investigated a range of reaction gases and internal standards and presented the results of a laboratory intercomparison exercise. Resano et al.146 described a rapid screening method for As species using thin layer chromatography (TLC) coupled with LA-ICP-DRC-MS. Arsenic species were separated on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates, which were developed in a (CH3)2CO–CH3COOH–H2O 2:1:1 v/v/v mixture. Interferences on the measurement of the 75As mass were eliminated by using H2 as the reaction gas in the collision cell. Sanz et al.45 reported the results of As speciation studies in biological samples including food, soil, hair and nails collected from a heavily contaminated region of India. Hernandez-Zavala et al.75 developed an automated method for the determination of As in biological matrices using HG-quartz tube atomizer-AAS with cryo-trapping for the pre-concentration and separation of arsines. Arsine from AsIII species was generated by reaction with Tris-HCl-NaBH4. Samples were pretreated with L-cysteine for generation of total arsine from both AsIII and AsV species. Rabeih et al.120 described a method for the determination of six As species (arsenite, arsenate, DMAIII, DMAV, MMAIII and MMAV) in human urine using ion-pair reversed phase HPLC with isocratic elution coupled to ICP-MS. The authors used the method to study As exposure in children from an As contaminated region of Brazil.
Yu et al.93 developed a miniaturised system for the determination of As in biological matrices using AFS. The system integrated HG with in situ atomisation in a dielectric barrier discharge atomizer and fluorescence detection using a side-on photomultiplier. The authors established the configuration of the atomisation and detection chambers, atomisation parameters and flow variables that gave optimised performance. An LOD of 0.03 µg L−1 was reported for a 500 mL sample volume. The method was validated by analysing rice and hair CRMs. De Souza et al.92 coupled on-line FI with HG-ETAAS for the quantitative determination of As and Se in biological matrices. Samples were microwave digested, As and Se reduced prior to HG and the hydrides collected on a rhodium coated tungsten atomizer. Reported LODs were 110 ng L−1 for As and 35 ng L−1 for Se, respectively, and the method was validated by analysing a range of NIST biological CRMs. Naranmandura and colleagues124 reported the identification of the major As binding protein in rat plasma following oral administration of arsenite. Separation of the As species, its determination and identification was achieved with gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography coupled to ICP-MS and MALDI-TOF-MS. The researchers identified the species as the ternary DMAIII haemoglobin-haptoglobin complex.
An important paper was presented by Slejkovec et al.125 which discussed a number of analytical artefacts that can arise in the preparation and storage of clinical samples for As speciation studies. It is pertinent to take note of these findings when research groups continue to report the identification of novel As species in biological matrices. A 15 year-old carrot is hardly a food but is certainly representative of stored biological materials. Iatharakilla et al.147 coupled anion exchange HPLC with ICP-MS for the separation and determination of As species in freeze-dried carrot samples collected over 25 years ago. In addition to AsIII, AsV, DMAV and MMAV, the authors reported the detection of MMAIII and monomethylthioarsonic acid (MMTA) for the first time in terrestrial foods.
Although the value of salivary trace element measurements for biomonitoring of exposure has been questioned by researchers over many years, the matrix continues to attract attention as a non-invasive biomarker. Yuan et al.114 described the determination of As species in saliva from a population exposed to As in drinking water. The As species, AsIII, AsV, MMA and DMA, were separated and quantitatively determined using LC-ICP-MS. Mean concentrations were 2.8 µg L−1, 8.1 µg L−1, 0.8 µg L−1 and 0.4 µg L−1 for AsIII, AsV, MMA and DMA respectively. The authors noted that saliva As concentrations correlated with drinking water As concentration and reported a statistically significant relationship between salivary As concentration and the presence of arsenic-induced skin lesions. Krishnamohan et al.148 monitored urinary As and porphyrins in mice chronically exposed to MMAIII in drinking water over a two year study period. Urine As species were determined using HPLC-ICP-MS and urine porphyrins determined using HPLC with fluorescence detection. The researchers considered that the determination of urine DMAV and porphyrin profile may be a useful biomarker for MMAIII exposure.
Kintz et al.149 determined As in two samples of Napoleon's hair. The results identified ‘massive’ amounts of inorganic As, which the authors considered to be consistent with chronic As intoxication. Finally, Xu et al.150 described the study of 104 workers who ingested high levels of As caused by a pipe leakage in a copper smelting factory. Urine As species were monitored using HGAAS with cold trapping. The researchers reported increased urine excretion of MMA and inorganic As compared with controls and concluded that biomethylation of As decreases in a dose-rate dependent manner.


5.3.3 Beryllium. 
Stephan et al.151described a method for the direct determination of Be in undigested blood and serum samples using ETAAS. Whole blood and serum samples were simply diluted, 8-fold and 5-fold respectively, with Nash reagent (CH3COOH–CH3COONH4 – acetyl acetone). No chemical modifier was required for determination of Be in serum using a pyrolysis temperature of 1000 °C and atomisation temperature of 2800 °C. For blood samples, improved analytical sensitivity was obtained using a Mg(NO3)2 chemical modifier with pyrolysis and atomisation temperatures of 800 °C and 2800 °C respectively. The authors reported an LOD of 2 ng L−1 for serum and 7 ng L−1 for blood.


5.3.4 Bromine. 
Cuyckens et al.61used HPLC-ID-ICP-MS and HPLC-ESI-MS for metabolite identification and profiling of a novel anti-tuberculosis drug, containing a single Br atom. The combination of accurate 79Br/81Br isotope ratio measurements and fragmentation analysis of ESI mass spectra enabled the researchers to identify the main metabolites in methanolic extracts of faeces from dogs and rats administered the drug.
Kataoka et al.63 described a method for the simultaneous determination of Br and I in biological matrices using ETV-ICP-MS. A TMAH solution was used as a chemical modifier to stabilise the analytes throughout the thermal programme. Reported LODs were 8.1 pg mL−1 and 0.91 pg mL−1 for Br and I respectively.


5.3.5 Cadmium. 
There has been continued interest in the application of extraction methods for the determination of Cd in biological matrices following recent past reviews.1 Pharr and Jones13 presented a comprehensive review of 16 published methods for the pre-concentration of Cd from urine for quantitative determination at levels below 1 mg L−1. Husakova and colleagues79conducted systematic studies on 11 chemical modifiers for the quantitative determination of Cd and Pb in urine using ETAAS with D2 backgound correction. The researchers considered NH4F to be the most effective chemical modifier for Cd in urine, promoting efficient atomisation at low temperatures and suppression of interference by NaCl. An LOD of 0.07 µg L−1 was reported. A Pd and Sr mixture was considered the most effective modifier for Pb in urine, stabilising Pb at pyrolysis temperatures up to 1200 °C and giving an LOD of 1.5 µg L−1. Methods were validated by analysing commercial RMs. Kippler et al.152 determined urinary Cd levels in 890 Bangladeshi women as part of a study examining the influence of Fe and Zn status on Cd absorption and accumulation. Urinary Cd concentrations were determined using ICP-MS and a mean concentration of 0.59 µg L−1 was reported. After adjusting for age and socio-economic status, the authors concluded that the increased accumulation of Cd was only seen for women with low Fe, but adequate Zn, status. Erie and colleagues153 investigated the relationship between blood and urine Cd concentrations and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Levels of Cd in both biological matrices were quantitatively determined in 53 patients with AMD and 53 age matched controls using ICP-MS. Current and former smokers with AMD had blood and urinary Cd concentrations 97% higher than smokers without AMD, 111% higher than non smokers with AMD and 107% higher than non smokers without AMD. The authors concluded that an increased total body burden of Cd may be an important factor in the development of smoking related AMD.
Methods employing cloud-point extraction for element pre-concentration have been regularly reported in recent reviews.1 In this review period, Maranhao et al.154 described a method for the determination of Cd and Pb in urine using ETAAS following cloud-point extraction of the two elements from the urine matrix. Aliquots of urine were acidified with HCl and the elements of interest complexed and extracted with ammonium O,O diethyl dithiophosphate in Triton X-114. The surfactant-rich phase was injected into the graphite tube, containing a Rh-coated platform, for quantitative determination. With a reported enrichment factor of 16, LODs were 40 ng L−1 and 2 ng L−1 respectively. The method was validated by analysing three CRMs. Moriera et al.78 presented a comprehensive review of different platform and tube geometries for the quantitative determination of Cd in whole blood. The researchers compared analytical performance using grooved, forked and integrated platforms in a longitudinally heated tube atomizer with performance using a transversely heated atomizer. They considered that no combination of platform and longitudinal atomizer matched the analytical performance achieved with a transversely heated atomizer. Suzuki et al.155 described a method for the determination of Cd in urine using ICP-MS. As interferences from Mo could not be eliminated using a DRC instrument, Mo was extracted from the urine matrix using a commercial chelating resin (NOBIAS-PA-1), allowing Cd to be determined with a reported LOD of 0.012 µg L−1.
Finally, Font et al.156 presented a very interesting study to investigate the potential of visible spectroscopy for screening Cd and Pb in mussels. Concentrations of Cd and Pb in a selection of mussel samples were determined using ETAAS and the results regressed against transformations of the recorded spectra for the same specimens using partial least squares regression. The calculated coefficients of determination were considered sufficiently accurate for screening purposes.


5.3.6 Chromium. 
Wolf et al.118described a method for the simultaneous determination of CrIII and CrVI in synthetic bio-fluids and waters using LC coupled with ICP-DRC-MS. The CrIII species was complexed with EDTA and the two species separated on a reversed phase column using a mobile phase of 2 mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide – 0.5 mM EDTA – 5% MeOH. Interference from the polyatomic 40Ar12C+ ion on the 52Cr mass signal was eliminated by using NH3 as reaction gas in the DRC. Reported LODs were 0.09 µg L−1 for CrIII and 0.06 µg L−1 for CrVI. The authors investigated matrix interference effects from common ions through spike recovery studies with simulated gastric and lung fluids.
A completely novel biomarker for pulmonary Cr exposure was described by Goldini et al.157 The authors used ETAAS to determine Cr in exhaled breath condensate and pulmonary tissue in patients with early operable non-small cell lung cancer. They reported that levels of Cr in both sample types increased following surgery. Urinary concentrations of Cr were also increased following surgery. There was a positive correlation between Cr levels in pulmonary tissue and exhaled breath condensate but not between exhaled breath condensate and urine Cr. They considered exhaled breath condensate was a promising biomarker for monitoring pulmonary Cr exposure, providing complementary information to that afforded by urine Cr measurement. Yoshida et al.158 used ICP-MS to determine concentrations of Cr and Mo in human milk of Japanese women. The median and range of values for Cr were 1 ng mL−1 and <0.1 – 18.67 ng mL−1, whilst for Mo the median and range were 3.18 ng mL−1 and <0.1 – 25.9 ng mL−1.


5.3.7 Cobalt. 
Liden and colleagues35described further work on the application of acid wipe sampling for the assessment of skin exposure to Co, Cr and Ni, which are recognised sensitisers. Volunteers from different occupational groups exposed to the metals had acid wipe samples taken from fingers and palms, following a normal work session. Concentrations of the three elements in the wipe sample were determined using ICP-MS. All samples collected contained quantifiable amounts of all three elements. Fingers were more exposed than palms and Ni concentrations were consistently higher than Co and Cr. Highest concentrations of Ni were determined in locksmiths (3.78 µg cm2 wipe area), a concentration that the authors considered was sufficient to elicit allergic contact dermatitis.


5.3.8 Copper and Zinc. 
He et al.89described a method for the determination of Cu in biological CRMs using on-line vapour generation-AFS. Samples were acid digested with HNO3 and the Cu vapour generated by reacting the acidified solution with KBH4 containing 1,10 phenanthroline. With optimized conditions, an LOD of 4 ng mL−1 was reported. Matsumoto et al.90 described a similar approach for the determination of trace amounts of Zn in biological matrices using ETAAS. An acidified sample solution was reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in NaBH4 and Zn in the gas phase introduced into a quartz tube atomizer for quantitative determination. An LOD of 0.2 ng mL−1 was reported. Ferreira et al.134 described a direct method for the determination of Cu and Zn in human hair using slurry sampling and sequential multi-element FAAS. Slurries were prepared by cryogenic milling and sonication of the hair samples. Optimised sampling conditions were established using univariate methodology and LODs of 88.3 ng g−1 and 53.3 ng g−1 were reported for Zn and Cu respectively. The method was validated by analysing two CRMs.
Belbraouet and colleagues159 compared the Cu and Zn status of hospitalized individuals with those of a ‘healthy’ community. Serum Cu and Zn were determined in 668 hospitalized individuals aged 70 and over and 104 age matched controls using FAAS. Hospitalized patients had significantly lower Zn levels but low serum Cu levels were rarely observed. The authors considered that elderly hospitalized patients were at a higher risk of Zn deficiency, but not Cu deficiency, and that the serum Cu:Zn ratio may be an additional marker of nutritional status in elderly hospitalised patients. It should be noted that a low serum Zn concentration is not necessarily a sign of deficiency; transfer from the circulation into cells is a feature of the acute phase response. Pragst et al.160 reported a tragic case of lung embolism and sudden death following inadvertent infusion of ZnO lotion. Toxicological studies were undertaken at autopsy and whilst drugs known to be administered to the patient were detected in therapeutic doses, Zn concentrations in lung tissue and arterial blood were respectively 200 and 10 times higher than reference values. Histology showed lung embolism with talc and ZnO, which was established as the cause of death. Cortesi et al.107 investigated the value of prostatic tissue Zn concentrations as a diagnostic tool for prostate cancer. Local Zn concentrations in needle biopsy cores from prostate tissue were determined by XRF and correlated with histological findings. The authors established a correlation between Zn concentrations and the presence of cancer. They considered that the amount of Zn depletion could be used as a measure of the Gleason score for the tumour and that local Zn mapping has the potential to improve patient selection for biopsy and therapy.
Shen et al.104 investigated the relationship between the distribution of Zn and zinc transporter mRNA expression in the mouse brain. The distribution and quantification of Zn was determined using SRXRF. The authors established that Zn was not evenly distributed in the brain, with levels of Zn being 5–10 times higher in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Correspondingly higher levels of expression of Zn transporter mRNA were found in these brain regions. Bradley and colleagues102 also used SRXRF and PIXE to map Zn and Sr concentrations at the interface between bone and cartilage in samples from equine metacarpophalangeal joints. The work confirmed previous findings of increased deposition of Zn and Sr at the surface of subchondrial bone and articular cartilage.


5.3.9 Gallium. 

Gallium maltolate is used as an antibacterial drug in equine husbandry. Martens and colleagues161 used ICP-MS to monitor serum Ga concentrations in neonatal foals following intragastric administration of 20 mg kg−1 gallium maltolate. A mean serum Ga concentration of 756 ng mL−1 was reported 12 hr following administration. The authors considered the concentration to be sufficient to suppress or kill Rhodococcus equi in infected tissues.


5.3.10 Gold. 
Ahlgren et al.162reported the results of a study to investigate the levels of plasma Au in individuals with gold dental inlays. Plasma samples were taken from individuals before implant insertion and subsequently at 12 months and 15 y following insertion. Plasma Au was quantitatively determined using ICP-MS. Levels of Au were elevated in individuals 12 months after insertion and the raised levels were positively correlated with number of inlaid surfaces. Plasma Au, however, did not increase significantly over the subsequent 15 years. The authors concluded that Au was released into plasma following insertion of gold dental inlays but the release was stable over long time frames.


5.3.11 Iodine. 

Macours et al.

described a method for the determination of I in urine using ICP-MS. Urine samples were simply diluted 20-fold with 1.5% HCl - Triton X-100 containing 103Rh as an internal standard. An LOD of 4 µg L−1 was reported. The authors compared results obtained by this method with those obtained by a spectrophotometric method. They noted that the ICP-MS method gave statistically significantly lower values across the range of measured concentrations.
Fernandez-Sanchez et al.164 determined I in human milk and infant formula using ICP-MS. For quantitative determination of total I, whole milk and formula samples were digested with 5% NH4OH using microwave heating. Iodine was also determined in the separate casein, fat and whey fractions which were separated by ultracentrifugation. The authors reported a mean I concentration of 144 µg kg−1 in milk and 53 µg kg−1 in infant formula. The largest proportion of I (80–90%) was associated with the whey fraction, 5–10% was associated with casein and less than 2% with the fat fraction. Reid et al.165 also reported a reliable method for the quantitative determination of I and Mo in milk samples. Samples were alkaline digested with TMAH and H2O2 prior to determination using ICP-DRC-MS. Interferences from 129Xe were eliminated by using He and O2 as reaction gases in the collision cell.

In vivo XRF measurements have been predominantly associated with bone Pb and Cd determinations as reported in last year's and previous years' ASU reviews. Hansson et al.97 investigated the application of XRF for the determination of I in thyroid tissue. The authors employed Monte Carlo modelling to determine the optimum geometry for in vivo measurement of the K-α signal. They emphasised a need for calibration with a precise knowledge of the measurement geometry and that corrections are made for proton scattering in the neck.


5.3.12 Iron. 

Brewer and Marcus
83
described methods for the determination of free Fe and metalloprotein-bound Fe using LC coupled with ICP-AES or particle beam/hollow cathode-AES. Iron-containing proteins were separated by SEC and RPC and the eluted species quantitatively determined by both spectrometric techniques. Reported LODs for Fe were 0.9 ng mL−1 for ICP-AES and 41.9 ng mL−1 for PB/HC-AES. The authors considered that PB/HC-AES had some advantages in its compatibility with a wide range of solvent polarities.


5.3.13 Lead. 

The work reported in this review period indicates a gradual eclipsing of ETAAS by ICP-MS as the chosen analytical method for quantitatively determining trace elements, including Pb, in biological matrices. For many years blood has been the predominant biomarker for assessing both environmental and occupational exposure to Pb. Bergdahl and Skerfving166 reviewed alternative biomarkers to blood for monitoring exposure to the element. They assessed the relative merits of each in relation to analytical accuracy, cost, practical issues and the relationships to exposure and to effects. They noted that no generally accepted biomarker for bioavailable Pb exists, though plasma, bone, teeth or urine have been discussed. The reviewers also considered that although previously identified problems in the determination of Pb in plasma had been overcome, plasma Pb has still not been sufficiently evaluated as an alternative to blood Pb in monitoring occupational exposure. Similarly they considered urine Pb deserved more attention. Liang and Sang56 described a method for the determination of Pb in urine and water using ETAAS after dispersive liquid–liquid extraction (cloud-point) of Pb from the matrix. Lead was chelated with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4-benzoyl-5-pyrazolone, extracted into CCl4 and dispersed in CH3COOH. With optimised conditions an enrichment factor of 78 was reported giving an LOD of 39 ng L−1. Tamiya and Yoshinaga43 used solid-phase extraction with a polyamine-polycarboxylic acid resin to separate Pb from biological matrices for isotope ratio analysis using ICP-MS. They noted that a resin with a divinylbenzene-methacrylate base was more effective than a simple methacrylate base. The method was validated by analysing a bone meal CRM. The determined 207Pb:206Pb and 208Pb:206Pb ratios were 0.8201 and 2.041 respectively and were in good agreement with the NIST reference values.
Bellis et al.167 described a study of Pb content and distribution in teeth of goats. The goats had been dosed with inorganic Pb for the production of blood Pb proficiency testing samples. The Pb content of whole teeth from 23 animals was determined using ETAAS. Concentrations varied from 0.6 to 80 µg g−1 and a positive linear relationship was noted between whole tooth Pb and cumulative dose. Spatial resolution of Pb in teeth was obtained using LA-ICP-MS. The researchers reported highly localised concentrations of Pb from 10 to 2000 µg g−1 in circumpulpal dentine and considered this to be a better biomarker of cumulative Pb exposure than whole tooth Pb.
Research groups continue to investigate the relationship between Pb exposure and accumulation in the skeleton. Brito et al.14 presented a comprehensive review of EDXRF methods for determining Pb in bone and the models of Pb metabolism that have been developed from the measurements. Popovic and colleagues168 compared statistical methods to correct for the left censoring effect observed in in vivo XRF measurements of bone Pb at low concentrations. The authors compared inverse variance weighting (IVW), the most common approach, with Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen estimation methods. They concluded that both sets of estimated parameters did not differ significantly from those determined using IVW. Hetter et al.32 described the production of small quantities of a candidate bone CRM for inter-laboratory assessment of bone Pb measurements. Long bones from animals dosed with Pb were cleaned, defatted and broken into pieces using a liquid N2 brittle fracture method. The bone was ground in a knife mill and ultra-centrifugal mill to produce a homogeneous finely powdered material.
Relationships between Pb exposure and disease states continue to be investigated. Historically, concerns over the effect of Pb on the brain have focused on infants and young children. Stewart and Schwartz96 conducted longitudinal studies to determine whether cumulative Pb exposure was associated with progressive brain effects. Study groups included groups occupationally exposed to inorganic and organic Pb and an environmentally exposed group. Blood Pb was determined using AAS and both tibia and patella Pb determined using XRF. They reported that higher tibia Pb levels were consistently associated with poorer cognitive function and noted that MRI measurements of organic Pb workers indicated a lower brain volume in those workers with high tibia Pb levels. Nigg et al.169 examined the relationship between blood Pb and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children exposed to ‘average’ environmental levels of Pb. Blood Pb levels were determined using ICP-MS. The authors reported that blood Pb levels were significantly higher in children diagnosed with ADHD and concluded that low level Pb exposure may be an important contributory factor to ADHD. Finally, Ghosh-Narang et al.170 investigated whether increased blood Pb in patients with end-stage renal disease was associated with parathyroid hormone status and release of Pb from the skeleton. The researchers investigated parathyroid hormone status and blood Pb in 51 patients on a dialysis programme. After adjusting for confounding factors, the higher blood Pb levels observed did not appear to arise from increased bone turnover.


5.3.14 Magnesium. 
Deng et al.128reported a ‘new’ method for the quantitative determination of free Mg and Mg species in rat plasma using CE coupled with ICP-AES. Baseline separation of seven Mg species was achieved with a 120 cm fused silica capillary and 50 mM CH3COO−Na+–CH3COOH electrolyte buffer. A number of the species were identified as free Mg2+, one albumin-Mg species and three globulin-Mg species. A mean concentration of 14 mg L−1 was reported for free Mg2+.


5.3.15 Manganese. 

Two groups of workers led by Michalke reported studies on speciation of Mn in human biological fluids. In the first,16 they reviewed current information on the toxicological relevance of Mn. The first part of the review examined natural and occupational sources of exposure and reported levels of Mn in different body fluids and tissues. The second part focused on analytical methods for the determination of Mn species in biological matrices paying particular attention to problems encountered in correct identification of relevant species.
In the second paper,127 methods were described for the quantitative determination of Mn species in serum and CSF using SEC and CZE coupled with IC-DRC-MS. The authors reported mean Mn concentrations of 2.6 µg L−1 in CSF and 1.7 µg L−1 in serum. The major carrier ligands in serum were transferrin and albumin but a third unidentified ligand of 700 Da molecular mass was identified with increasing serum Mn levels. In CSF, Mn was bound predominantly to low molecular mass species (640–680 Da), the major ligands being identified as Mn- citrate using CZE- ICP-MS. A mean concentration of 0.7 µg L−1 was reported for Mn-citrate in CSF.


5.3.16 Mercury. 

As with previous reviews, interest in Hg relates to its quantitative determination and speciation in fish and seafood, which is considered a primary source of exposure. Cortes and Fortt171 investigated Hg concentrations in a range of fresh and tinned fish and shellfish from markets in Chile. Concentrations of Hg were determined using CVAAS. The authors estimated daily Hg intake values of 0.08 to 3.8 µg kg−1 (body weight) for high fish consumers. Lowery et al.172 reported an inter-laboratory study that compared CVAAS with thermal decomposition-amalgamation AAS (TDA-AAS) for the quantitative determination of Hg in 15 fish tissue homogenates. Results from laboratories using TDA-AAS were significantly higher (18.3%) than those from laboratories using CVAAS, which was consistent with previous spike recovery studies which had reported a mean recovery of 104% for the TDA-AAS method and 88% for the CVAAS method.
Dittert et al.53 presented a method for the determination of Hg in biological samples following cloud-point extraction of the element from the matrix. Samples were microwave digested with H2O2 - HNO3 and the Hg extracted using 0.5% ammonium O,O diethyldithiophosphate and 0.3% Triton X-114. Phase separation was induced by addition of Na2SO4. The Hg phase was reacted with NaBH4–HCl and the Hg vapour quantitatively determined using CVAAS. An enrichment factor of 10 was reported giving an LOD of 0.4 ng g−1. Rizea et al.86 described a sensitive method for the determination of Hg in fish tissue using CVAAS after wet digestion of the sample. Measurement of Hg was performed at the 184.9 nm absorption line using a non dispersive mini-analyser modified from a system designed for atmospheric Hg measurements. The authors reported 2.5 times better sensitivity using the 184.9 nm line rather than the more conventional 253.7 nm line. Wang and colleagues173 reported a method for the determination of total Hg in fish using ID-ICP-MS after mild extraction of the element from the matrix. The authors discussed errors in the determination of Hg isotope ratios and validated the method by analysing total Hg in two fish CRMs. Han et al.88 described a novel on-line electromagnetic induction heating method for the determination of inorganic and organic Hg in seafood samples using AFS. For total Hg determination, organic Hg was oxidised with K2S2O8 in the induction heating column at a low power (15 W). Inorganic Hg was determined by keeping the induction heater at room temperature. Organic Hg was calculated as the difference between the two measured values. Chang et al.174 used LC coupled with ICP-MS for speciation of Hg and Pb in fish samples. Following microwave digestion of samples with EDTA in mercaptoethanol, inorganic Hg, methyl and ethyl Hg species were separated by reversed-phase LC using a C18 column and a 0.2% mercaptoethanol-1 mg L−1 EDTA - 174.2 mg L−1 sodium 1-pentanesulfonate - 12% CH3OH mobile phase. Reported LODs were in the range 0.2–0.3 µg L−1 for Hg species. The method was validated by analysis of two CRMs. Serafimovski et al.175 determined inorganic Hg and MeHg in fish using CVAAS and ICP-AES. They reported that minimal conversion of Hg species was achieved using fast microwave digestion of fish tissue in TMAH or HCl. With optimised chemical and instrumental parameters, selective determination of Hg2+ was achieved using CVAAS with a 1% SnCl2 reductant in 0.1 M HCl. Total Hg was determined directly in the TMAH digest using a 1% NaBH4 reductant and CV-ICP-AES. The concentration of MeHg was calculated by subtracting the measured Hg2+ value from the total Hg value. The method was validated by analysing fish CRMs.


5.3.17 Molybdenum. 

Lopez-Garcia and colleagues
176
described two methods for the determination of Mo in milk and infant formula using ETAAS. For solid formula samples, 10% slurries were prepared in 25% H2O2 – 75% HF, an exceedingly hazardous mixture in the opinion of this review team, and directly introduced into the furnace. Quantitative determination was achieved with a Pd chemical modifier and aqueous calibration standards. A characteristic mass of 25 pg and LOD of 0.02 µg g−1 was reported. For liquid milk samples, a pre-concentration procedure was developed in which Mo was adsorbed onto an Amberlite IRA 743 column and eluted with 5% NaOH. A 30-fold enrichment factor was reported giving an LOD of 0.04 µg L−1. The authors also used SEC to separate Mo containing macromolecules and established that Mo was unbound or bound to low Mr species in cow milk but protein bound in human milk.
Yoshida and colleagues158 reported values for both Cr and Mo in human milk samples from a sample Japanese population. Both elements were determined using ICP-MS. The median value and range of Mo concentrations was 3.18 ng mL−1 (<0.1–25.9 ng mL−1), whist for Cr the median and range was 1 ng mL−1 (<0.1–18.7 ng mL−1).


5.3.18 Phosphorus. 

There are generally a handful of papers reported in each ASU review period that describe atomic spectrometric methods for the determination of non metal elements. Venkatachalan et al.177 described the application of LA-ICP-MS for the determination of P in phosphoproteins blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes following separation by SDS-PAGE. The authors reported quantitative determination over the range 20 to 500 pmol of protein P and an LOD of 1.5 pmol for P in β casein.


5.3.19 Platinum group elements. 

As the use of platinum group element based anticancer drugs continues to progress, so similarly methods to measure the elements in biological matrices continue to be developed. Bosch et al.178 presented a comprehensive review of the latest analytical methods for determining cisplatin in biological fluids and tissues at ppb levels. Brouwers et al.179 described a sensitive method to determine Pt in DNA extracts of blood mononuclear cells and tissue samples from patients treated with cisplatin. Platinum was quantitatively determined in Pt-DNA adducts extracted from 10 mL blood samples and 1 mg tissue samples using ICP-MS and an LOQ of 0.75 pg was reported. Results using the ICP-MS method were in good agreement with results from a 32P post-labelling assay but the authors considered the ICP-MS method to be more sensitive and less laborious. Esteban-Fernandez115 investigated the interaction of cisplatin with cytosolic biomarkers using SEC-ICP-MS and ESI-MS to detect and identify the species of interest. The authors incubated cisplatin with cisplatin adducts. Sar et al.180 described a sensitive method for the determination of cisplatin-DNA adducts using capillary LC coupled with ICP-MS. The authors used the method to detect cisplatin-DNA adducts generated in vivo following administration of cisplatin to Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies. The authors reported direct correlations between the concentration of cisplatin-DNA adducts formed, the induced genotoxic damage as demonstrated by comet assay and the concentration of administered cisplatin. Ip and colleagues181 described a method for the determination of oxaliplatin and its putative biotransformation derivatives in plasma. Plasma samples were deproteinised using MeOH immediately after collection and stored under conditions that ensured stability of Pt species. Platinum-containing species were detected using ICP-MS. The authors identified intact oxaliplatin as the major species in plasma but the putative transformation product Pt(R,R diaminocyclohexane)Cl2 was undetected.
Hemstrom et al.119 evaluated several organic solvents for the separation of cisplatin species using hydrophilic interaction chromatography(HILIC) coupled with ICP-MS. The authors considered best performance was obtained with 1,4 dioxane, which offered the best compromise between carbon deposition in the mass spectrometer and separation efficiency. Groessl et al.129 investigated CE coupled with ICP-MS for the determination of Ru-protein species in serum and plasma from patients administered indazolium (KP1019). Ruthenium was predominantly bound to serum albumin. Ott and colleagues182 used ETAAS to quantitatively determine Ir in cultured HF-29 carcinoma cells incubated with Ir based metallodrugs. Cells were treated with HNO3 and HCl and optimised performance was achieved with a pyrolysis temperature of 1400 °C and atomisation temperature of 2400 °C. An LOD of 11.2 µg L−1 was reported.
Al-Saleh et al.183 investigated the in vitro maternal-fetal transport kinetics of carboplatin. Carboplatin was injected as a bolus into the maternal circulation of isolated, perfused placenta lobules. Perfusate samples were collected from the maternal and fetal circulation and the concentration of Pt determined using AAS. The results suggested a very low level of carboplatin transfer from the maternal to fetal circulation.
Two papers reported methods for biomonitoring occupational and environmental exposure to platinum group elements. In the first, Iavacoli et al.184 investigated exposure of urban tram drivers in Rome to Ir from catalytic converters. Concentrations of Ir in air samples, collected within trams, and urine samples from 64 tram drivers were determined using ICP-SF-MS. Although Ir was detected in ultrafine dust particles, no statistically significant increase in Ir was found in urine from tram drivers compared with a control population. A separate group185 monitored exposure to Pt released from automotive catalytic converters in a group of tram drivers working in Vienna and Budapest. The researchers determined Pt in pre and post shift urine sample using ICP-SF-MS. They compared median urine Pt values with those obtained from a similar population in an earlier study. They noted that present urine Pt levels were four times higher than previous values.


5.3.20 Rare earth elements. 
Malik et al.69examined two methods for the determination of lanthanides in biological matrices. In the first, lanthanides were extracted from the sample matrix by liquid–liquid extraction with bis(2-ethylhexyl)orthophosphoric acid in toluene and back extracted into 6M HNO3. The acid was evaporated and the residue dissolved in H2O for separation by CE and quantitative determination of the lanthanides using ICP-MS. In the second, the sample solution was injected into a micro-nebuliser desolvation system for introduction into the plasma of the ICP-mass spectrometer. Both methods were used to determine lanthanides in mussel tissue. The authors reported that the CE method was insufficiently sensitive to detect lanthanides but they were quantitatively determined at ng g−1 levels using the desolvation method.
Saussereau et al.186 reported the investigation of a case of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis resulting from an overdose of a gadolinium-containing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) medium. Gadolinium concentrations were determined in blood, hair and nail samples from the patient, using ICP-MS. Levels of Gd in all three sample types were 300 to 1000 times higher compared with samples from a control group. The authors considered the method had considerable value for monitoring patients required to undertake repeated MRI examinations.


5.3.21 Selenium. 

Work again has focused on speciation of Se in biological matrices. Goenaga-Infante et al
27
presented the findings of an international inter-comparison exercise to assess analytical performance in the determination of Se and SeMet in pharmaceutical selenised yeast tablets. Analyses were performed by 15 national metrology institutes and expert laboratories. No sample preparation procedure was prescribed and so a variety of sample preparation methods were described. Quantitative determination of Se and SeMet was performed using ID ICP-MS, HPLC-ICP-MS and GC-ICP-MS. The group considered that expert laboratories could achieve accurate results for total Se and SeMet with 10% expanded uncertainty.
Jitaru and colleagues187 coupled affinity HPLC with quadrupole ICP-MS for simultaneous quantitative determination of selenoprotein P, glutathione peroxidise and selenoalbumin in human serum. Serum samples were subjected to anion exchange solid-phase extraction prior to chromatographic separation. Ballinhaut et al.66 described a method for the detection of selenoproteins at femtogram levels in polyacrylamide gels using LA-ICP-MS. A 40-fold improvement in analytical sensitivity was reported through the use of an infra red (1030nm) low energy high repetition femtosecond laser, giving ultra fast ablation, compared with a nanosecond 266 nm laser. Rosini et al74 developed a method for the determination of Se in biological matrices using TS-FF-AAS (thermospray flame-furnace AAS). Samples were microwave digested and a 600 µl sample volume introduced into a hot metallic nickel tube at a rate of 0.4 ml min−1. An LOD of 8.7 µg L−1 was reported, which was a 95-fold improvement over that obtained by conventional FAAS. The method was validated by analysing a range of biological CRMs. Huang et al.123 described a non-chromatographic approach for the direct speciation of inorganic and organic Se in biological samples using FI dual column extraction and pre-concentration coupled on-line with ICP-MS. Inorganic SeIV and SeVI species were selectively adsorbed onto Al2O3 nanospheres in the first column, whilst the organic Se species, SeMet and SeCys, were separated in a second column containing TiO2 modified with dimercaptosuccinic acid. With this approach, quantitative determination of SeIV, SeVI, SeMet and SeCys was achieved by sequential analysis of eluents from columns 1 and 2. Reported LODs for the four species ranged from 45 to 210 ng L−1. Biera et al.188 derivatized SeCys and SeMet by carbamidomethylation prior to proteolytic digestion for quantitative determination using HPLC-ICP-MS. The fraction containing the derivatized species was isolated by SEC ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC. The reported LOD was 0.02 µg g−1. The method was applied to the discrimination of the concentrations of SeCys and SeMet containing proteins in tissues of animals given Se supplementation.
The influence of Se status on As metabolism in an As exposed population was investigated by Huang et al.189 The researchers determined urine and serum As and Se in subjects chronically exposed to high levels of environmental As, who demonstrated As induced skin lesions, and in a control population. Total As and Se concentrations were determined using DRC-ICP-MS. Serum Se levels were slightly but significantly lower (41.4 µg L−1 vs 49.6 µg L−1 respectively) and serum As levels were higher (5.2 µg L−1 vs 3.4 µg L−1) in the group with skin lesions compared with controls. Furthermore, the percentages of methylated As species (MMA and DMA) were reduced in the skin lesion group. The researchers concluded that lower serum Se status is significantly correlated to As-related skin lesions in the exposed population and that low Se status also reduced As biotransformation.


5.3.22 Silicon. 

Persistent concerns over risks to young babies from contaminants in human milk led Semple
19
to review current knowledge on the toxicology of silicone biomaterials and leaching of silicone from gel breast implants. The author presented data indicating no evidence of elevated Si in blood or human milk of women with implants whereas data from cow milk and commercial infant formula indicated significantly elevated levels of Si (mean Si = 708 ng mL−1 in cow milk, mean Si = 4402 ng mL−1 in infant formula) compared with human milk (55 ng mL−1). The author considered that the review would provide valuable information for surgeons and healthcare workers to advise women with breast implants who were contemplating breast feeding.


5.3.23 Strontium. 
Zamburlini et al.100reported studies on the in vivo determination of Sr in finger bone using XRF. They examined, through Monte Carlo simulations, the feasibility of coherent normalization to correct for individual variability in bone size and shape. They considered that accurate measurements could be achieved by using the 35.5 KeV coherent peak to correct for bone size together with an independent measurement of overlying soft tissue thickness. The same group reviewed both XRF and dual photon absorptiometry methods for the in vivo determination of Sr in bone. Da Silva et al.112 described a method for the in vivo and ex vivo determination of Sr in teeth using EDXRF. They reported that, using a 1.8 mm probing depth, the front central incisors were the most suitable site for quantitative determination of Sr. The method was validated by comparing ex vivo XRF measurements of Sr in molars with values obtained using ETAAS. The authors used the XRF method to determine enamel Sr concentrations in a population from the Toronto metropolitan area. They reported a mean value of 169 ppm and a range from 42 to 301 ppm.
Hollriegel and colleagues190 investigated the kinetics and urinary excretion of Sr in 42 volunteers following injection of stable 84Sr. Concentrations of 84Sr were determined in plasma and urine using TIMS. The authors reported that the measured rate of plasma Sr clearance was much faster than that predicted by the existing model advocated by the International Commission of Radiological Protection. They considered that the clearance may be due to rapid transfer of Sr from plasma into other body compartments. In vitro studies indicated no binding of Sr to erythrocytes.


5.3.24 Thallium. 
Dadfarnia et al.52 described a method for the quantitative determination of Tl in a variety of biological matrices (hair, nails, natural and waste water) using FIA-FAAS. Total Tl was reduced to TlI by reduction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride and preconcentrated by adsorption onto immobilised oxine on a surfactant coated alumina micro column. The deposited Tl was eluted with 500 µL 1 M Na2S2O3. A pre concentration factor of 77 and corresponding LOD of 2.5 µg L−1 was reported for a 25 ml sample volume.


5.2.25 Tin. 
Guerin and colleagues191determined organotin concentrations in a range of fish and shellfish from French coastal areas as part of an investigation of dietary intake of organotin in a French population. Organotin species were separated and quantitatively determined using capillary GC coupled with MIP-AES. The authors identified butyltin as the predominant Sn species in most samples analysed, with concentrations in fish samples ranging from 1.1 to 23 µg kg−1. Tuna, salmon, mackerel and cod were the main contributors to total organotin intake. However, dietary exposure in this population was less than 47% of the tolerable weekly intake recommended by the European Food Safety Agency.


5.3.26 Titanium. 
McGarry et al.192investigated serum Ti levels in a group of eight patients who had undergone femoral nailing with Ti implants. Blood samples were taken at 6 week, 3 month, 6 month and 12 month post-operative time points and serum Ti quantitatively determined using ICP-MS. The authors reported mean serum Ti levels between 49 and 60 µg L−1 over the 12month period and found no evidence of elevated serum Ti levels within the first year of implantation.


5.3.27 Tungsten. 

Sodium tungstate has been identified as a potential drug for treatment if type 1 and 2 diabetes. Rodriguez-Farinas and colleagues193 used SEC coupled with ICP-MS to characterise W containing species in human serum incubated with tungstate. Satisfactory screening for W–protein species was achieved using a Biosep-S2000 column with 20 mM HEPES – 150 mM NaCl as a mobile phase. Three W-containing peaks were identified, an albumin- W complex, free tungstate and an unknown protein of Mr > 300 KDa.


5.3.28 The Uranides. 

An interest in measurements of U in biological matrices in relation to military activity continues to be reported. Bland and colleagues194 assessed U uptake in UK military personnel involved in the early stages of the Iraq conflict. Spot urine samples were collected from four groups having different potential for exposure to depleted U and 238U:235U isotope ratios determined using ICP-SF-MS. Mean isotope ratios ranged from 138.0 for clean-up personnel to 138.2 for combat personnel. Two urine samples with elevated ratios were retested using more sensitive MC-ICP-MS and were found to be within the measurement uncertainty for natural U. The authors concluded that any uptake of depleted U among the study group was unlikely to have further health implications. Parrish et al.195 reported a test procedure to monitor an individual's aerosol exposure to depleted U. They reported that measurement of U in urine using ICP-MS could detect depleted U excretion some 20 years after exposure, when inhalation exposure was unambiguous and in sufficient quantity. The authors used the method to study individuals working at or living close to a munitions plant in Colonie, New York.


5.3.29 Vanadium. 

A comprehensive review of speciation analysis of V in biological and environmental materials was presented by Chen and Owens.18 The reviewers particularly focused on sample preparation and separation methods for the determination of V species using hyphenated spectroscopic techniques.
Pacheco et al.50 described a method for the determination of V species in urine using ICP-AES. Inorganic V species were pre concentrated from the urine matrix onto a micro column of L-methionine immobilised on controlled pore glass. In alkaline (pH 9) medium, total V was quantitatively adsorbed onto the column, whilst a pH 5 medium achieved selective adsorption of VV. Adsorbed V was eluted with 10% HCl for quantitative determination. The authors examined the effect of sample flow rate and interfering ions on the determination of V. Sample introduction with a USN gave a reported LOD of 0.008 ng mL−1 with an enrichment factor of 900 (a factor of 10 for USN and 90 for preconcentration).

6 Applications: Drugs and pharmaceuticals, traditional medicines and supplements
In a review (109 references) of the use of ICP-MS in drug metabolism studies, Gammelgaard et al.196 once again indicate the suitability of this technique over radio-isotopic methods and highlight the potential of determining the stoichiometry in metallo-drug biomolecule interactions by simultaneous monitoring of metals in metallo-drugs and intrinsic elements in biomolecules. In a more specific review (76 references), Bosch et al.17 provide a systematic survey of the latest analytical techniques for the determination of cisplatin at low levels (µg L−1) in biological samples. Use of ICP-MS as an element-specific detector during HPLC analysis of pharmaceutical products was demonstrated through the analysis of vitamin B complexes.197 Biotin, cyanocobalamin and thiamine were detected by monitoring Co, P and S and improved the analysis by resolving the coelution of thiamine and cyanocobalamin peaks in a rapid isocratic separation. A further demonstration was given based on the degradation of an unnamed active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) into two degradation products by monitoring Br, Cl and S. Although the use of diode array detectors apparently introduces a bias, the possibility of monitoring UV absorbance and elemental ions sequentially was demonstrated to provide enhanced analytical specificity without requiring interpretation of complex mass spectra. A number of newly developed metal-containing pharmaceuticals featured in studies involving Ir and Ru anti-cancer agents,129,182 a Br anti-tuberculosis drug61 and sodium tungstate to treat diabetes.193 Methods employed included ETAAS, HPLC-ICP-MS and CE-ICP-MS

Herbal supplements and preparations were the subject of several surveys. The mineral content of 16 species of Indian Phellinus medicinal funghi showed certain toxic elements such as As, Cd, Co and Pb were not detected (which raises questions over the sensitivity of the AAS procedure) whereas the presence of Ge and Se was demonstrated for the first time in this species.198 Of 100 herbal products available on the Malaysian market containing Smilax myosotiflora, 89% did not exceed 0.5 ppm of Hg.199

The results of an international intercomparison study to assess the analytical capabilities for the determination of total Se and SeMet in selenised-yeast supplement tablets by various worldwide expert laboratories were published.27 Regardless of preparation method or deterministic technique used, good results were obtained with uncertainties below 100% and where recovery of SeMet from SELM-1 averaged 95.0% (n = 9). The authors identified several advances in analytical methods for determination of SeMet, including the combined use of double IDMS with HPLC-ICP-MS following extraction with methanesulfonic acid and a simplified two-step enzymatic hydrolysis with protease/lipase/driselase followed by HPLC-ICP-IDMS, both using a species-specific IDMS approach. Dernovics and Lobinski200 applied hydrophilic interaction LC with a hybrid linear ion trap.orbital ion trap mass spectrometer to characterize nine Se species in a yeast-base food supplement in a single analytical run.
7 Applications: Foods and beverages
7.1 Progress for individual elements

Many papers covered in this review have focused only on the method development aspect of atomic spectrometry, most of which have involved optimisation and validation against RMs. This has meant there appears to have been a paucity of research informing on more in-depth understanding of individual elements or in bringing new species to light (monomethylthioarsonic acid, monomethylarsonous acid, selenohomolanthionine and two selenoproteins are cited below). One interesting observation is that much effort is being devoted to speciation in biological samples without recourse to complex chromatography and these are described below.

7.1.1 Arsenic. 

Speciation in biological samples without recourse to complex chromatography was exploited by several authors. Laser ablation-ICP-MS of polyethyleneimine cellulose TLC plates was developed to allow picogram levels of AsIII, AsV, MMA and DMA to be separated while AB and AC remain unresolved as a baseline spot.146 This fast and qualitative monitoring method was rendered more reliable using H2 as DRC gas for the removal of the 40Ar35Cl+ overlap on 75As+. After an ultrasound-assisted digestion of rice and wheat with 1 M H3PO4, concentrations of AsIII, AsV, MMA and DMA were determined by HG-AFS using a series of proportional equations corresponding to four different experimental reduction conditions.49 The recoveries were greater than 90% and gave species concentrations in agreement with other studies of the same rice flour RM. This same approach of predicting species from total As was reported for providing possible information on levels of inorganic or organic As in fish and seafood (See 7.2.6 for more details).201

Two new species were confirmed as monomethylthioarsonic acid (MMTA) and monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII), identified in freeze-dried carrot collected by the US EPA over 25 years ago, using HR-ESI-MS. They yielded molecular ions of m/z 154.9152 and 122.9418; both new species were oxidised to MMAV on addition of H2O2.147 These species were quantified with anion-exchange HPLC-ICP-MS using an Ion-120 column and 40 mM (NH4)2CO3 at pH 9.0 as eluent.

Of several new methodologies for the determination of total As, a miniature device with in situ atomisation (dielectric barrier discharge atomizer) and fluorescence detection in a lab-on-valve configuration was developed by Yu et al.93 Using a 500 µL sample volume, a linear range of 0.10 to 5.00 mg L−1 was achieved with a detection limit of 0.03 µg L−1, similar to conventional AFS, and a sampling frequency of 80 h−1. An FI method for ICP-MS analysis of aqueous extracts and biological digests was developed using two different eluents which gave a detection limit of 38 ng L−1 with 0.3% HNO3 in 10% MeOH–62 ng L−1–20 mM phosphate buffer.202 Similar LODs (110 ng L−1) were made possible in ETAAS by using a FI hydride generator, coupled to a 150 W tungsten coil with a hydride trapping time of 30 s, achieving an hourly sample throughput of 70 h.192


7.1.2 Mercury. 

Direct injection high efficiency nebuliser (DIHEN) sample introduction for ICP-MS can facilitate the analysis of difficult analytes prone to memory effects: Chang et al.174 describe the chromatographic conditions for the quantification of Hgi, MeHg, EtHg as well as PbII, trimethyllead, and triethyllead (C18 column; 0.2% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol – 1 mg L−1 EDTA – 174.2 mg L−1 sodium 1-pentanesulfonate – 12% v/v MeOH at pH 2.8). The Hg and Pb species in biological tissues were quantitatively extracted into 10 g L−1 EDTA – 0.2% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol solution and gave spike recovery from 93 to 99%. A non-chromatographic extraction speciation protocol by sequential cloud point extraction (CPE) was developed by Li and Hu.203 This method was based on the complexation of Hg2+ with I to form HgI42− which was then reacted with methyl green. The Hg2+ complex was extracted in Triton X-114, separated from MeHg by centrifugation and diluted with 0.5 M HNO3 prior to analysis by ICP-AES while the MeHg was similarly recovered using APDC, providing an extraction efficiency of 93.5% and 51.5%, respectively. A paper in Chinese describes an on-line electromagnetic induction heating column linked to AFS for the determination of MeHg and Hgi in seafood.88 For total Hg determination, the heating column was operated at 15 W facilitating the potassium persulfate oxidation of MeHg whereas Hgi was determined without heating. For Hgi and MeHg respectively, the method gave LODs of 0.036 µg L−1 and 0.043 µg L−1 and RSDs of 2.4% and 3.6%.

Rapid total Hg analysis in various food-based oils using direct injection ETAAS was described by Bozhanov et al.81 The method was based on the use of the hexamethylene ammonium salt of N,N-hexamethylene dithiocarbamic acid (2.5% in IBMK) as matrix-modifier and diluent to provide thermal stabilization at 400 °C, with an atomization temperature of 800 °C. This gave short term and medium term RSDs in the range of 3 to 14%. Two of the principal AA techniques for determination of total Hg in fish tissue, CVAAS and thermal decomposition, amalgamation AAS (TDA-AAS) were compared through the analysis of 15 fish tissue homogenates by eight experienced laboratories (four laboratories for each technique). The authors found that the latter technique gave significantly higher results (18.3%) and boldly suggested this as a correction factor to directly compare the two techniques.172 Other CV methods were optimised for ICP-MS,87 AAS and ICP-AES175 and for a non-dispersive mini-analyser which showed that using the resonance line at 184.9 nm gave a better sensitivity (about 2.5 times) than the 253.7 nm wavelength.86


7.1.3 Selenium. 

The simultaneous determination of SeMet and SeCys using ion pairing HPLC-ICP-MS was developed by Bierla et al. in meat204 and whole milk.205 Meat and offal were extracted with urea in the presence of dithiothreitol, the Se species of both sample types were derivatised with iodoacetamide (derivatisation yield measured with 77SeMet) followed by quantitative proteolysis using Protease XIV and purified with SE-HPLC; quantification was by standard additions. A fast, non-chromatographic FI-ICP-MS speciation method was devised and optimised which used on-line dual-column preconcentration and separation.123 Complete separation was achieved using nm-sized Al2O3 to adsorb SeIV and SeVI in preference to organic Se in one column and dimercaptosuccinic acid-modified mesoporous TiO2 to selectively adsorb SeIV and selenocystine over SeVI and SeMet. The method achieved LODs of 45–210 ng L−1 with precisions of 3.6–9.7% depending on the species. The unique S metabolic pathway in the Japanese pungent radish (Raphanus sativus L. cv. ‘Yukibijin’) has allowed the identification of a new Se species because researchers suspected this vegetable should also have a unique and homologous Se metabolic pathway.206 Of the water-soluble fraction (68.5% of total), the majority comprised SeVI (approximately 45%), SeMeCys (approximately 11%) and a new Se species (5%) identified by ESI-MS-MS as selenohomolanthionine which has a suggested pathway involving the phosphorylation of homoserine to produce O-phosphohomoserine and the subsequent reaction of O-phosphohomoserine with selenohomocysteine. Two new Se-containing proteins were isolated from Se-rich yeasts using 2-D gel electrophoresis and identified as SIP 18 and HSP 12.207 A sensitive technique was developed for detecting selenoproteins by LA-ICP-MS from 1-D PAGE using a low energy, high repetition infrared femtosecond laser (39 µJ/pulse, 10 kHz, 1030 nm). The use of this type of laser led to a 40-fold increase in sensitivity compared to the 266 nm laser mainly because a larger amount of ablated material could be introduced during the dwell time for the MS.66

Despite the overwhelming interest in Se speciation, several analytical protocols for total Se have been proposed. Manjusha et al.39 proposed a UV-oxidation of food samples with HNO3 and H2O2 for determination of total Se using ETAAS with unreduced Pd(NO3)2 matrix modification, or reduced Pd if a S-containing matrix such as mushroom or Brazil nut was analysed. Thermospray flame Ni furnace-AAS allowed a 95-fold improvement in the LOD compared to FAAS using a sample volume of 600 µL introduced at a rate of 0.4 mL min−1.74 Rhodium thermally reduced over a 150 W tungsten coil atomiser proved very efficient at collecting Se hydrides as part of a FI manifold for determination by ETAAS.92


7.1.4 Other elements. 

Flow injection preconcentration for the speciation of Tl employed a microcolumn packed with immobilized oxine on surfactant-coated alumina linked to FAAS.52 In the presence of EDTA, only TlI is retained on the microcolumn and can be eluted with 1 M sodium thiosulfate which allows total Tl to be determined after reduction of TlIII to TlI by hydroxylamine hydrochloride. The method boasts a 2.5 ng L−1 LOD and 2.6% RSD at 30 ng L−1. Determination of V species in natural water was carried out by on-line conversion of cationic and anion species into the corresponding V-EDTA complexes which were then separated on a short anion exchange column to prevent species interconversion through loss of CO2 or O2 exposure and eluted with 4 mM carbonate buffer – 5 mM Na2EDTA.208 Ionic Br and I species were separated after microwave-assisted extraction, using CE separation (50 cm × 75 µm id fused-silica with 10 mM Tris buffer at pH 8.0 and 8 W voltage) before quantification by ICP-MS with a microconcentric nebuliser.209 Detection limits were given as 20–50 ng mL−1 for Br compounds and 1 ng mL−1 for I compounds, based on peak height and RSD was in the range 3–5% with spike recoveries in the range of 94–105%.

Optimization of preconcentration techniques for various elements, many used on-line, have been prevalent this year. Preconcentration of AlIII in biological and water samples by CPE used 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4-benzoyl-5-pyrazolone (PMBP) with entrapment in Triton X-114 to achieve an enrichment factor of 37 which, when coupled with ETAAS and PMBP as matrix modifier, achieved an LOD of 0.09 µg L−1 and RSD of 4.7% (at a concentration 1000x the LOD).210 A selective separation and preconcentration of SnIV in water samples, as well as canned beans (and zinc shot), was accomplished after optimisation in a batchwise solid phase extraction (SPE) set-up using the polyphenolic compound quercetin, immobilised on silica gel or polyurethane foam, as chelating agent prior to HG-AAS.211 A dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction preconcentration technique for the determination of total Pb by ETAAS in biological and water samples, using PMBP as chelating agent and CCl4 and EtOH as dispersants, allowed a 78-fold concentration factor and LOD of 39 ng L−1 (defined as 3 × SD).56 A method for trace Mo determination in drinking water was developed using on-line FI-SPE-ICP-AES with ultrasonic nebulization.212 The minicolumn contained ethyl vinyl acetate turnings without further complexation and gave rise to a 300-fold concentration with an LOD of 0.04 µg L−1 and a precision of 3.5% RSD within a 5 minute cycle time. Two FI-SPE systems for the ultra-trace determination of Te in tap water by ETAAS were developed and compared.213 The first system involved preconcentration onto Dowex 1X8 which resulted in a 42-fold enhancement factor and 7 ng L−1 LOD, but only achieved 37% retention efficiency, while the 72% retention efficiency of LaOH3 coprecipitation followed by retention onto XAD resin had a much higher LOD at 66 ng L−1 and concentration factor of 25 and 8.3% RSD (measured at a concentration 1000× the LOD).

Correction for the interference of 129Xe+ in the ICP-MS determination of low levels of I by the introduction of He and O2 (1.0 mL min−1 and 0.6 mL min−1) into the DRC serendipitously resulted in the quantitative conversion of Mo+ into MoO2+ thus allowing its determination in the same m/z region, using Sb as a common internal standard.165 The authors developed a preconcentration method for sub µg L−1 I using a cation exchange column loaded with Pd2+ and Ca2+ ions, followed by elution with ammonium thiosulfate. This technique was applied to the investigation of I chemistry in milk sample digests. Bismuth was positively evaluated as an internal reference for Pb determination in red and white wine vinegars using ETAAS and Ru as permanent matrix modifier with Pd–Mg(NO3)2 co-injection.82 Spike recoveries showed 96–108% compared to 72–86% without internal reference; the LOD was 0.3 µg L−1.

7.2 Single and multi-element applications in food and beverages

7.2.1 Dietary intake studies. 

By using a duplicate diet methodology, the mean daily dietary intake (DDI) of Cr and Cu in SE Spain was assessed by Velasco-Reynold et al.214,215 through ETAAS analysis of hospital restaurant meals over 36 days as 77 ± 17 µg d−1 and 941.5 µg d−1, respectively. Both total Cr and Cu levels were significantly related to macronutrient level and also to their dialysable fractions (4.2% and 25.95%, respectively). Breakfast was found to furnish significantly lower amounts of these elements. Meals containing more than 75 mg Fe decreased the net absorption of Cr and the dialysable Cu fraction increased with increasing Cr content. The consumption of rice in Sweden was found to contribute to daily requirements of some essential elements (Cu, Fe, Mn, Se and Zn) and concentrations of Fe and Mn concentrations were found to be significantly higher in brown rice.216

The weekly As intake by Taiwanese residents was calculated at 30.6 µg kg−1 bw wk−1, following a survey of 60 commercial fish (muscle) products using HPLC-ICP-MS.217 However, since 87% of the As occurs as AsB (DMAA, MMAA and AsIII were undetected), which is rapidly excreted after ingestion, the authors ascribe a low risk to the high As exposure which is double the WHO suggested level. Karavoltsos et al.218 assessed organically-grown food available on the Greek market for Cd and Pb content. The authors not only found that organically-grown food contained lower levels over conventional farming but warned that “uncertified products” contained “far larger” concentrations. Motivated by public health concerns from exposure to MeHg, a pilot study of the risk of Hg intake through fish consumption on the Chilean population was carried out using CV-AAS.171 Only swordfish was found to exceed national and international limits, and, from the estimated theoretical intake, frequent fish eaters were considered to be at greatest risk (0.56 µg kg−1 bw wk−1 to 26.6 µg kg−1 bw wk−1). A study of certain heavy metals in Hong Kong secondary school children found that milk, vegetables and seaweed were the major contributors to the dietary intake of Hg, Pb and Sb.219 Whereas the intake of Sb by high-consuming students (0.57 µg kg−1 bw wk−1) is nearly a factor of ten below the Tolerable Daily Intake the consumption of Hg is only half the PTWI of Hg (5 µg kg−1 bw wk−1) and Pb is five times below the PTWI (25 µg kg−1 bw wk−1). On balance the students were considered to have a low health risk from consuming these foods.


7.2.2 Human milk and infant formula. 

A persistent concern for the exposure of babies breast-fed by mothers with silicone implants prompted Semple19 to review these issues and compare human milk with milk from several other sources. The mean Si content of infant formulae was 4402 ng mL−1 (26 samples) and supermarket-purchased cows' milk was 708.9 ng mL−1 whereas previous studies have indicated that human milk was 55 ng mL−1 for women with implants and 51 ng mL−1 for those without. The study of human milk and plasma from 209 lactating women (from the United Arab Emirates and other countries) with babies aged four to 80 weeks indicated that As, Cr and Mo increased with length of lactation while Cu, Mn and Zn decreased.220 Yoshida et al.158 determined the Cr and Mo concentrations of human milk from 63 Japanese women as mean (with range in parentheses) 1.00 ng mL−1 (<0.1 to 18.67 ng mL−1) and 3.18 ng mL−1 (<0.1 to 25.91 ng mL−1), respectively. The I content of three fractions of human milk and infant formula was measured using ICP-MS after ultracentrifugation.164 The mean total content for human milk was 144.0 ± 93.2 µg kg−1 whereas infant formula was only 53.3 ± 19.5 µg kg−1 in which the whey fraction contained 80–90% of the I, fat contained 2% and casein 5 to 10% for both types of milk. Several other authors have developed and validated new methods for the analysis of human milk or infant formula: using slurry injection ETAAS176 or microwave digestion prior to ICP-MS221 or ICP-SF-MS.30,222


7.2.3 Milk and dairy products. 

Processed cheese was used as a vector to assess the oral bioavailability of Al in food using 26Al-labelled sodium aluminium phosphate (basic SALP) added at 1.5% and 3% to the cheese administered to rats; it was found to be similar to that in drinking water.223 The authors suggested that given the greater contribution of food to the daily Al intake compared to drinking water, the latter does not contribute a disproportional amount to the absorbed gastrointestinal load.


7.2.4 Cereals, flour and rice. 

The physical partitioning of As and other elements in white and brown rice was investigated by Meharg et al.224 using SRXRF. In white rice, As is distributed throughout the endosperm but in brown rice it is localised in the superficial pericarp and aleurone layers as confirmed by LA-ICP-MS. In both types of rice, Asi and DMA species were found although the Asi was higher in brown rice and the measured ratio of inorganic:organic species depended on the analytical methods used. Localisation of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn followed a similar pattern to As in brown rice while Cd and Ni were distributed throughout the endosperm. Removal of As during washing and cooking in an abundant volume of water was found to be successful during a study on three samples of Hungarian and Chinese rice having As concentrations within national limits, using HPLC-ICP-SF-MS.225 The predominant species in raw rice was AsIII while in cooked rice the species was AsV. An AFS method developed for quantification of Ge in rice showed that this element was nearly four times more abundant in brown than in white rice (4.98 ng g−1 and 18.1 ng g−1).91 Analysis of cereals and legumes consumed by Indonesian infants showed unfortified cereals had lower concentrations of Ca, Fe and Zn than legumes as well as lower phytate:mineral molar ratios; mineral content was determined by FAAS and phytate by HPLC.226 Rice milling increased Ca and Fe levels but decreased Zn, while boiling also increased Ca but frying decreased Fe in tempe (a whole grain soyabean product). A slurry sampling technique for ICP-AES was described for flour and flour-based products and was favourably validated against wet digestion.84 In order to remove the Mo interference on Cd quantification of cereals and soybeans during ID-ICP-MS analysis, Inagaki et al.40 proposed addition of 6 M NaOH post digestion which forms colloidal hydroxides of Cd but not of Mo.

The difference in bioavailability of Se in biofortified and process-fortified grains was studied by Kirby121 through the consumption of wheat biscuits in a clinical trial monitored by a non-specific ID and RP ion pairing-ICP-MS technique. Mean plasma Se of the biofortified biscuit eaters increased throughout the six month trial (122 µg L−1 at start to 194 µg L−1 at six months) while those eating process-fortified biscuits showed little increase until four months of exposure and thereon remained constant (122 µg L−1 to 140 µg L−1 at 4 months), clearly showing the importance of the fortification route. Because of the high protein and amino acid nutritional value of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) and quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willdenow) in which Se may be expected to be preserved particularly as SeMet, the Se status of these plants was assessed using HPLC-ICP-MS.227 Cultivated on soils fortified with Ba selenate and selenite, buckwheat gave total Se concentations of 170.4 ± 2.0 µg kg−1 and SeMet as the only organic species whereas the total Se for quinoa was 102.7 µg kg−1 wet weight, containing SeMet, SeVI and other non-protein forms.


7.2.5 Vegetables, fruits and nuts. 

Traditional vegetables grown in western Kenya have been shown to be more nutritious than introduced species such as spinach, kale and cabbage in terms of Ca, Fe and Zn, knowledge which could contribute towards the promotion of safe and nourishing vegetable species.228 Mineral and trace elements in black and green Turkish table olives were analysed and differences were found in the Fe, Mg, Pb, Sn and Zn concentrations between the two types which the authors ascribed to the influence of the processing method, brand or packaging material.229 A validated methodology for on-line preconcentration of metals in vegetables (guarana and cabbage) for use with ICP-AES was described by Bezerra.55 Mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) cultivated on compost amended with As-contaminated mine waste or arsenate solution (200 µg g−1) were found to contain total As concentrations from 2.3 µg g−1 to 16 µg g−1 dry weight with the species AsIII, AB, DMA and TMAO being present.230 Compost not inoculated with A. bisporus did not contain AB and the authors hypothesised that this species arising from fungal arsenic metabolism plays a role in nutrient translocation and fruiting body turgor.


7.2.6 Fish and seafood. 

In order to provide more data on the levels of organotins in French fishery products, Guerin et al.191 analysed 159 composite samples from four coastal areas using capillary GC-MIP-AES. ButylSn were the major species detected, although at lower levels than previously published. Oily fish (38%) contributed to the total organotin exposure with scallop, surimi and oysters bringing this to over 50%, although this was only 47% of the PTWI. When only total As concentrations are available it is possible to predict levels of organic and inorganic As as identified by Schoof and Yager.201 These authors reanalysed 20 studies reporting total As and Asi and 13 studies involving DMA and MMA in freshwater, anadromous, and marine fish as well as crustaceans and molluscs. Mean Asi concentrations were approximately 10–20 ng g−1 wet weight in fish and 40–50 in crustaceans and molluscs whereas DMA averages were 45–95 ng g−1 wet weight for all species studied except freshwater fish which was 10 ng g−1. It was reported that MMA was detected rarely and no correlation was observed between total As and Asi. However, the authors did suggest that in order to make conservative health risk assessments, it was valid to work on a basis of 2 to 3% of total As being Asi in marine and estuarine fish, crustaceans and molluscs, and 10% for fresh water fish, as based on 75th percentiles of the dataset.

New analytical protocols have been developed and validated by several authors for the assay of fishery products and used to establish concentration ranges for the elements studied. Da Silva et al.231 have optimised and validated a slurry sampling FAAS technique (80 mg sample ground in a cryogenic mill; dilution with 10 M HNO3–HCl; sonication time 30 min; slurry volume 10 mL) for the assay of Cu, Fe and Mn in oysters. This was applied to samples taken in two marine locations in Brazil and the established concentration ranges were 17.1–143.9 µg g−1; 364–1388 µg g−1 and 17.9–29.7 µg g−1, respectively. The multivariate optimization, and subsequent validation, of ultrasound-assisted extraction of As, Ni, Se and V from fish and shellfish prior to ETAAS was described by Lavilla et al.48 The concentration ranges (dry weight) for the elements determined in an array of fish and shellfish from Spain were 12.6–190 µg g−1, 2.94–46 µg g−1, 0.73–2.34 µg g−1 and 0.82–5.14 µg g−1, respectively. Font et al.156 used ETAAS to cross-validate a visible spectrometric assay for Cd and Pb in mussels, demonstrating the possibility of using this as a fast, clean, low-cost visible screening method. Ultrasound-assisted pseudo-digestion was optimized for the measurement of As, Cd and Pb in freshwater fish prior to ETAAS without significant differences observed when compared to conventional digestion.46,47 An easy analysis of seafoods with a simple sample preparation was demonstrated using EDXRF.232


7.2.7 Meat and poultry. 

The simultaneous determination of SeMet and SeCys in chicken and lamb muscle and various offal tissues was carried out using SE-HPLC-ICP-MS during an 18-month period and were shown to account for 91 ± 8% of the total Se (see x.1.3 for more details).204 Forte and Bocca29 developed a ICP-SF-MS method to determine Cd and Pb in offal. Applied to the analysis of Italian calf, lamb and pig offal, Cd concentrations ranged from < 3.5 ng g−1 in calf spleen and lung to 96.4 ng g−1 in kidney or 114 ng g−1 in pig liver; all lamb offal was < 3.5 ng g−1. For Pb, concentrations ranged from 4.03 ng g−1 in calf lung to 31.8 ng g−1 in liver and from 4.71 ng g−1 in lamb heart to 279 ng g−1 in liver with pig liver reaching a maximum of 9.19 ng g−1.

Authenticity assessment of meat and poultry products most effectively employs both trace element and stable isotope ratio data for C, N and O. Beef samples from the principal cattle producing regions of the world were analysed by ICP-MS for multi-element data, and isotope ratio MS for 13C, 15N and 18O stable isotope content.233 Canonical discriminant analysis allows the differentiation of three broad geographical production zones (Europe, South America and Australasia) using the following parameters (in order of discrimination): δ13C (from defatted dry mass), Sr, Fe, δ2H (from lipid), Rb and Se. Sagely, it was acknowledged that although this method is able to provide reliable information on beef origin, it is restricted to the countries providing the canonical model. Franke et al.234 assessed the suitability of the ratio 87Sr/86Sr, measured on the ashed fraction using ICP-MS, along with the δ18O to differentiate poultry and dried beef samples from various countries. Whereas the δ18O provides sufficient discriminatory power to distinguish samples according to country of origin, the 87Sr/86Sr ratio failed to provide necessary differentiation and was discarded as a useful parameter.


7.2.8 Drinking water and non-alcoholic beverages. 

Work on natural or drinking water has mainly been targeted at the development of new protocols to access data on mainly transition elements with minimal mention of intended applications. New methodology is described in section 4.2.1 for the determination of Cd and Pb by cloud point extraction with on-line preconcentration before multi-element FAAS,54 Mo,212 Te213 and speciation of V by HPLC-ICP-MS.208 An operating protocol is described for the use of a portable TRXRF instrument for determination of Ca, K and V in commercial bottled drinking water which gave reasonable estimates.235 A high-throughput ICP-MS introduction system comprising an autosampler, a switching valve, a high efficiency PFA-ST nebulizer and Peltier-cooled cyclonic spray chamber for the analysis of natural and certified water samples was described by Mahar et al.58 Analysis was accomplished in 90 s with improved washout times, doubling the throughput.

Teas, infusions and decoctions have been the objects of several papers. Extraction times (10, 15 & 20 minutes) were studied for a wide range of plant materials (19 species) for both infusion and decoction prior to analysis by ICP-AES.236 An optimum time of 10 min was chosen as most elements (Ag, B, Cu, Co, Fe, In and Zn) had reached their maximal concentration by this time, with the exception of K. Elements of unusually high concentration are noted as Ca (19,686 mg kg−1 in Crataegus orientalis), Cu (12.2 mg kg−1 in Cinnamomum cassia), Fe (1,296 mg kg−1 in Melissa officinalis), K (29,168 mg kg−1 in Cinnamomum cassia), Mg (3179 mg kg−1 in Melissa officinalis), Na (2,564 mg kg−1 in C. cassia), P (12,698 mg kg−1 in green tea), Pb (3.9 mg kg−1 in green tea), Se (23.5 mg kg−1 in Coriandrum sativum), Zn (26.0 mg kg−1 in Matricaria chamomille). No Ca was detected in green or black tea and the authors do not explain why such high concentrations were reported. The extent of leaching of Cd and Pb from dried fruits or fruit infusions was investigated by Bobrowska-Grzesik and Jakobik-Kolon.237 The authors used direct analysis by slurry ETAAS of the dried material and compared with results after decoction or infusion (20 minutes or 10 minutes, respectively). Maximum concentrations were found in bilberries (Cd: 0.81 µg kg−1; Pb: 1.37 µg kg−1). Leaching of Cd was between 6% and 8%, whereas for Pb leaching was between 35% and 48%. Analysis of commercial coffee samples by a validated FAAS method (Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb and Zn) after dry ashing of both ground coffee and infusions evaporated to dryness allowed the authors to conclude that coffee available in Poland posed no threat to health.238 Additionally the elemental data collected permitted the coffee samples to be differentiated according to variety (arabica or robusta) or format (ground, instant coffee or infusion).


7.2.9 Alcoholic beverages. 

The determination and fractionation of metals in beer, using atomic spectrometry methods, was reviewed by Pohl,24 highlighting their role in brewing. Possible associations between metals, the effect of methods of beer preparation and analysis on the total metal content and approaches to metal partitioning in beer were discussed. The same author239 describes an optimised sequential tandem column separation system for the isolation of Mn and Zn in beer into polyphenolic, cationic and neutral/anionic fractions with recoveries greater than 94%. A trial application on three Polish beers showed that the polyphenolic fraction contained 8% to 37% Mn and 21% to 53% of Zn, while the cationic fraction accounted for the major share between 45 to 61% of Mn and Zn 27% to 53%. The neutral fraction, containing between 13% to 40% of both Mn and Zn, was thought to comprise polydentate ligands such as amino acids, hydroxycarboxylic acids and keto acids from primary or secondary (fermentation) sources. Pohl240 also reviewed the information regarding elements in wine from endogenous and exogenous sources, changes during vinification, analytical methodology and nutritional value. Although not analysed by atomic spectrometry methods, ethylated organoSn compounds, an interesting but curious group of analytes to study in spirits and wines, were determined using SPME and pulsed flame photometric detection GC.241 This study confirmed the presence of these compounds, suggesting storage in plastic containers is the main source of organoSn, an area that certainly deserves more study. More conventionally, Ajtony et al.242 proposed a method based on well-known methodology for the direct sample introduction of wine in ETAAS using end-capped transverse heating graphite tube with Pd–Mg(NO3)2 matrix modifiers; Caldas et al.243 used a similar approach for the assay of As, Cu and Pb in Brazilian cane spirit.

In contrast to the surfeit of authenticity papers in last year's review,1 only a few groups have published studies on wine authenticity. Alvarez et al.245 successfully used Linear Discriminant Analysis and procedures based on Artificial Neural Networks to discriminate three Andalucian appellations based on the concentrations of 12 elements (Al, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Sr and Zn). Another larger survey of 23 elements and 103 randomly selected wines available in Lithuania showed again that simple statistical tests can classify wines of different regions using only three or four elements.246
