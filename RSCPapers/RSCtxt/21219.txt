    , Accepted 1st September 2014First published on 2nd September 2014AbstractTwo heteroleptic ruthenium complexes, SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H, with four alkyl groups and two alkyl groups, respectively, on the terminal of their ancillary ligand were prepared. These two complexes have a similar absorption profile, energy level and orbital distribution of the frontier orbitals. Therefore, they are good model compounds to explore the effect of the molecular structure of a ruthenium sensitizer on their photovoltaic performance, especially when cobalt electrolyte was used in assembling the device. When I−/I3− electrolyte was employed, the dye-sensitized solar cell based on SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H sensitizers achieved similar power conversion efficiencies of 9.54% and 9.64%, respectively, because the two dyes have similar optical and electronic properties. Nevertheless, when Co(II)/(III) electrolyte was used, the SJW-B18 sensitized device has a higher efficiency (7.30%) than the CYC-B11H-based cell (6.65%), mainly in higher open-circuit voltage (0.829 V vs. 0.784 V). Electrochemical impedance and intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopic data reveal that the SJW-B18 dyed titanium dioxide (TiO2) anode has better surface protection compared to the CYC-B11H adsorbed TiO2 film. The physical insulation of the TiO2 surface with the four alkyl groups on the SJW-B18 dye can reduce the charge recombination between the electron on TiO2 and Co(III) to increase the open circuit voltage, and the power conversion efficiency of the device. These results provide a new strategy for designing ruthenium sensitizers which are compatible with a cobalt-based electrolyte.
1. Introduction
Looking for an affordable, renewable and with no side-effects energy source is a big challenge. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies, have been developed as a result of their color, semi-transparency, flexibility, impressive efficiency, notable stability, and possible low manufacturing cost.1–3 In DSSC, upon photo excitation, the dye injects electrons into the conduction band of a porous titanium dioxide (TiO2) anode and is subsequently regenerated back to its neutral state by obtaining an electron from a redox couple.4 An I3−/I− redox couple is the one most widely used in DSSCs because the regeneration of the dye by I− is very fast and the recombination of I3− with the electrons in TiO2 is extremely slow.5 DSSC with an I−/I3− electrolyte has achieved remarkable photovoltaic efficiencies of over 11%6–11 and the highest efficiency obtained was 11.9%.12 Nevertheless, using the I−/I3− redox couple has some disadvantages, namely, the triiodide ion absorbs visible light, its relatively high over-potential for dye regeneration,13 its aggressiveness towards the metal electrode, its low redox potential which limits the open-circuit voltage (Voc), and the simple structure of I−/I3− which prevents molecular modification on the electrolyte to increase the Voc of the DSSC. Therefore, searching for an alternative electrolyte for DSSC has become one of the most intensive searches in the past decade.
A wide variety of redox mediators have been investigated, including halogenides,14,15 pseudohalogenides,16 thiols,17–19 and metal complexes with nickel,20 copper,21 iron22 or cobalt23 centers. Amongst these iodine free redox couples, the cobalt-based redox couple has been proven to be the most suitable one because of its weaker absorption of visible light and the fact that it is less aggressive toward metallic conductors.24,25 Power conversion efficiencies of more than 10% have been reached using cobalt-based electrolyte combined with a metal free organic dye Y123 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) cathode catalyst26 or a metal containing porphyrin dye.27 However, despite the extensive investigations during the last decade, the DSSC based on cobalt redox mediators still exhibited a lower efficiency compared to the I−/I3− couple with ruthenium (Ru) complexes as sensitizers.28–33
Previous studies have suggested that the fast recombination of electrons in TiO2 with a one-electron outer-sphere Co(III) complex34–36 and slow diffusion of cobalt mediator as well as slow dye regeneration by Co(II) which limits the short circuit photocurrent density are the reasons for the poor photovoltaic performance of a ruthenium-based sensitizer. Fan37,38et al. used a photoanode made from nanowire or used a nanowire array anode to increase the diffusion rate of the electrolyte to improve the efficiency of DSSC based on a cobalt redox couple by increasing the pore size of the TiO2 anode to facilitate the diffusion of the Co-based electrolyte. Hagfeldt39et al. suggested that by introducing long-chain alkyoxy groups in to the dye molecule can retard the unwanted charge recombination process to improve the device's efficiency. Recently Frey40et al. also demonstrated that cyclometalated Ru(II) sensitizer with a steric cyclometalating ring (and two alkoxyl substitutes) were also compatible with a cobalt redox couple (8.6% for cobalt electrolyte vs. 8.7% based on an iodine electrolyte). They used transient absorption decay and charge extraction measurements to show that the kinetics of charge recombination and dye regeneration are similar for two types of electrolytes. Detailed studies show that the recent breakthrough in efficiency of a Ru sensitizer with Co-based redox electrolytes is because of a reduction of interfacial recombination through the increase of the steric bulkiness of a selected dye, enhancing the charge collection efficiency. Therefore, the high efficiency of the cobalt-based device is directly correlated to the good TiO2 surface protection, preventing the recombination between the electrons in TiO2 and Co(III) species in the electrolyte.24,25
In this paper we report on the synthesis and photovoltaic performance of a new Ru sensitizer SJW-B18 (its molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1), which was designed for using in DSSC with a cobalt electrolyte. SJW-B18 has four alkyl groups on the terminal of the ancillary ligand, which can form a protection layer when adsorbed on to TiO2 to avoid the charge recombination. To prove that the surface of the dye adsorbed TiO2 film can be protected with the alkyl chains on the sensitizer, another Ru dye, CYC-B11H (the structure is shown in Fig. 1, its ammonia counterpart was reported before9), was also prepared for comparison. CYC-B11H and SJW-B18 dyes have similar optical and electronic properties and the only difference in structure is the number of terminal alkyl chains. Therefore, when Co(II)/(III) electrolyte was used in the device, the variation in the photovoltaic performance between these two dyes can provide some information for designing a Ru dye which is compatible with the cobalt electrolyte.

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and characterization
All the reagents were obtained from the commercial sources and used as received unless specified. Solvents were dried over sodium or calcium hydride (CaH2) before use. The structure of the dyes was identified using proton nuclear magnetic spectroscopy (1H-NMR), fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS) and elemental analysis. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer with deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) or deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6). FAB-MS spectra were obtained using a Jeol JMS-700 HRMS system. Elemental analyses were carried out using an Heraeus CHN–O–S Rapid F002 analysis system. UV-visible spectra were measured using a Cary 300 Biospectrometer. The electrochemical study of the dye dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) was performed in a single-compartment, three-electrode cell with a Pt wire counter electrode. The reference electrode was Ag/Ag+ and the supporting electrolytes were 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in DMF. The square wave voltammograms (potential step increment: 10 mV; frequency: 25 Hz) were recorded using an Eco-Chemie Autolab PGSTAT 30 potentiostat/galvanostat with ferrocene as an external calibration standard. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) calculation based on a Gaussian 09 program,41 adopting the B3LYP/DGDZVP function and basis set,42 was used in combination with the conductor-like polarizable continuum model,43 applied to account for the solvation effects, to optimize the geometry and to calculate the frontier orbital distribution of the dye molecule in DMF.

Synthesis of SJW-B18 (Ru[(dcbpy)(Ligand-18)(NCS)2]) and CYC-B11H. 
Ligand-18 for SJW-B18 was prepared by the alkylation and Stille coupling reactions. The detailed synthetic procedures can be found in the ESI.†SJW-B18 was synthesized using an one-pot method similar to the reaction protocol we had reported previously:44 0.22 g (0.36 mmol) of [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2, 0.50 g (0.71 mmol) of Ligand-18, 0.10 g (0.41 mmol) of dcbpy and excess (8.0 mmol) of NH4NCS were used sequentially in the reaction. The crude product was dissolved in a mixture of methanol and an aqueous solution of tetra-butyl ammonium hydroxide (TBAOH, 40 wt% in H2O) and then purified using a Sephadex LH-20 column using methanol as an eluent. The main band was collected and the pH of the solution collected was adjusted to approximately 3 by adding 0.1 M HNO3(aq). The precipitate collected was washed with water and then dried under vacuum. After further purification, 0.150 g (0.12 mmol, 18.1% yield) of a deep purple coloured SJW-B18 was obtained. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, δ/ppm in DMSO-d6, J Hz): 9.45 (d, J = 5.61 Hz, 1H); 9.16 (d, J = 5.96 Hz, 1H); 9.11 (s, 1H); 9.07 (s, 1H); 8.96 (s, 1H); 8.92 (s, 1H); 8.33 (d, J = 5.66 Hz, 1H); 8.24 (d, J = 3.68 Hz, 1H); 8.18 (d, J = 6.05 Hz, 1H); 8.03 (d, J = 3.80 Hz, 1H); 7.95 (d, J = 5.81 Hz, 1H); 7.65 (d, J = 6.05 Hz, 1H); 7.51 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 1H); 7.42 (d, J = 6.09 Hz, 1H); 7.39 (d, J = 3.75 Hz, 1H); 7.35 (d, J = 6.15 Hz, 1H); 7.30 (s, 1H); 7.20 (s, 1H); 2.73 (m, 8H); 1.57 (m, 8H); 1.32 (m, 8H); 0.91 (m, 12H). MS calculated: m/z 1170.3 ([M]+). High resolution FAB-MS found: m/z 1170.1731 (m) ([M]+); 1112.3 (s) ([M − NCS]+). Elemental analysis: calculated for C56H56N6O4RuS6.1.5H2O: C, 56.06; H, 4.92; N, 7.00; S, 16.02%. Actual: C, 55.89; H, 5.16; N, 6.85; S, 15.60%. CYC-B11H was prepared and identified using a very similar method to that reported previously.8 The detailed preparation steps can be found in the ESI.†


DSSC device fabrication and characterization. 
A 12 μm (or 4 μm) thick transparent layer (20 nm in diameter) and a 4 μm of a scattered layer of anatase TiO2 (400 nm in diameter, prepared in our laboratory) were deposited sequentially on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass to make the photoanode. Detailed methods for TiO2 film preparation and device fabrication can be found in our earlier paper.45 A TiO2 film was immersed into a 300 μM solution of SJW-B18 or CYC-B11H containing 20–30 mmol chenodeoxycholic acid as a co-adsorbent in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol (volume ratio 1:1) at room temperature for 3 h (for thin TiO2 film) and 12 h (for thick TiO2 film). Two types of electrolytes with different active ingredients (listed in Tables 1 and 3) were used for the device fabrication. The photocurrent voltage characteristics were obtained by applying an external voltage bias to the devices exposed to an irradiance of AM1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2) given by a 450 W xenon light source (Yamashida Co., Japan), while measuring the generated photocurrent using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The active illuminated area was a 0.25 cm2 square obtained by using a metal mask.

The dye loading was measured by desorbing the dye molecules from the practical TiO2 anode with a solution of 0.1 g mL−1 TBAOH–DMF. The calibration curve of the dye in TBAOH–DMF solution was obtained and the number of dye molecules adsorbed on TiO2 anode was determined from the absorption spectrum using the calibration curve.


Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). 
TAS measurements were performed in the Ultrafast Systems Proteus flash photolysis spectrometer with a light pass designed by our laboratory. A laser light was used to excite the dye molecules in the DSSC device and a white light was passed through the device to measure the absorption of the excited dye molecules. The decay of the absorption intensity at 820 nm was used to study the regeneration kinetics of the excited dye. The rate constants (or decay time) were extracted by fitting the data using Ultrafast Systems Surface Xplorer software to obtain the rates for the regeneration of the dye molecules using the I− in the redox couple and the electron in TiO2.46


Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). 
EIS measurement was carried out using an Eco-Chemie Autolab PGSTAT 30 potentiostat/galvanostat in 50 mV voltage steps, with a sinusoidal potential perturbation of 10 mV in the dark. The applied voltage is close to the Voc of the measured device and the potential perturbation was applied over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz–1.0 MHz. The resulting impedance spectra were fitted according to the transmission line model proposed by Bisquert47et al. using the Scribner ZView software.


Intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS). 
IMPS/IMVS was used to study the charge transport and back recombination reaction that occurred in the DSSC. The experimental setup for the measurement is similar to that described in the literature.48 IMPS/IMVS response was recorded with a Zahner Zennium controlled intensity modulated photo spectroscopy, CIMPS-1 potentiostat installed with a light intensity modulated function. The light source used is Xpot-26341 and the light intensity corresponding to 1/20–1/3 sunlight (5–33.3 mW cm−2) was used. The potential perturbation was applied over a frequency range of 0.1 Hz–10 kHz with amplitude of 10 mV. The electron life time (τn or τd), electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) and electron diffusion length (Ln) were calculated according to the equations of (τn = 2πfmin (IMVS))−1 (or τd = (2πfmin (IMPS))−1, Dn = d2/4τn and Ln = (Dnτn)1/2, fmin: the minimum frequency of the IMPS response, d: thickness of TiO2), as proposed by Krüger43et al.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of ruthenium dyes and their optical properties
The ancillary ligand (Ligand 18) of SJW-B18 was synthesized according to the method shown in Scheme 1. The detailed synthetic procedures and structure identification of each intermediate and final product can be found in the ESI.†SJW-B18 was synthesized using a one-pot method (described in the Experimental section) similar to the reaction protocol we had reported previously.44CYC-B11H is a proton form of CYC-B11 as reported previously.9 The detailed steps for converting the ammonia form (CYC-B11) to the proton form (CYC-B11H) are also described in the ESI.† The electronic absorption spectra of SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H measured in DMF and immobilized on the transparent TiO2 film (thickness of approximately 3 μm) are displayed in Fig. 2. SJW-B18 dissolved in DMF displays two intense absorption bands centred at 395 nm and 558 nm. The high energy band is assigned to the overlap of the ancillary ligand intra-ligand π–π* transitions and one of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) bands. The low energy band at 558 nm with a molar absorption coefficient (ε) of 2.16 × 104 M−1 cm−1 is attributed to another MLCT transition which determines the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of the corresponding device. CYC-B11H in DMF has a MLCT band centred at 557 nm with a ε of 2.40 × 104 M−1 cm−1 which is higher than that of SJW-B18, and this is probably because the latter has a lower molecular weight. When SJW-B18 is anchored onto the surface of a transparent TiO2 film, a slight blue-shift (approximately 6 nm) of the MLCT band is observed together with a slight change in the absorption profile, which is induced by the effect of de-protonation in the dye self-assembly process and maybe the conformation of dye molecules also changed after adsorbing on TiO2. A similar phenomenon was observed when CYC-B11H adsorbed on TiO2 film. Comparing the absorption spectra of both dyes adsorbed on to TiO2 thin films, the absorption profiles are similar except for the absorption intensity of the MLCT band for the SJW-B18 dyed thin film is slightly weaker (because of lower dye loading or smaller absorption coefficient).

3.2 Energy level and isodensity surface plots of the frontier orbitals for SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H dyes
To investigate the driving force for the electron injection from photo-excited dye into the conduction band of TiO2 and the regeneration of the oxidized dye by the redox couple, square-wave voltammetry of SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H was performed (the data is shown in Fig. S1, ESI†). The energy levels of the ground and excited states for SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H determined by combining the oxidation potential and the absorption threshold (in DMF) are given in Table 1. The ground state potential of SJW-B18 dissolved in DMF is 0.95 V vs. a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (−5.45 eV vs. vacuum), which is close to that (0.96 V vs. NHE) of CYC-B11H and more positive than the redox potential of the iodide/triiodide or Co(bipy)3II/III redox couple used in this study, thus both oxidized dyes can be reduced effectively by the electrolyte. The excited state oxidation potential (ES+/S*) of SJW-B18 (approximately −0.60 V vs. NHE) and CYC-B11H (approximately −0.61 V vs. NHE) are also almost the same (within experimental error), both dyes have sufficient driving force for the electron injection from the excited dye into the TiO2 conduction band (EC = approximately −0.5 V vs. NHE). These data indicate that the number and length of the alkyl chains at the end of the ancillary ligands will not significantly affect the electronic state of the heteroleptic ruthenium sensitizer.
The graphical representation of the computed frontier orbitals for SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H are shown in Fig. 3. The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of both dyes are contributed primarily from the Ru-NCS mixed orbitals and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are localized on 4,4′-dicarboxyvinyl-2,2′- bipyridine anchoring ligands. Not only the participation and energy level of the frontier orbitals for the two dyes but also the energy of the MLCT band (see the next paragraph) are similar between SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H. Because the optical and electronic properties of the two sensitizers are similar, the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding devices was affected only by the structure of the dye molecules and the absorptions (dye loading time absorption coefficient) of the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 anodes. SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H dyes are, therefore, good for studying the effect of the molecular structure of the ruthenium sensitizer on the surface protection of dye adsorbed TiO2, and therefore, the photovoltaic performance of DSSC devices when cobalt complexes are used as a redox couple.

3.3 Photovoltaic performance of ruthenium sensitizers
To demonstrate that both SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H are excellent sensitizers for DSSC, devices based on the I−/I3− electrolyte were studied first. The characteristic photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of the devices (device A and B) sensitized with SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H, measured under the illumination of AM 1.5G simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2), are displayed in Fig. 4. The detailed photovoltaic parameters and dye loading are also given in Table 1. The power conversion efficiency (9.54%) of the SJW-B18 sensitized device (device A) is slightly lower than that (9.64%) for the device sensitized by CYC-B11H (device B), mainly because of the smaller Jsc, which is probably because the latter has more dye with a higher absorption coefficient adsorbed on to the TiO2 anode. The corresponding incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the device A and B presented in Fig. 4b show a strong spectral response from 450 nm to 650 nm, having a maximum efficiency of 82% (at 543 nm), and 81% (at 550 nm) for the devices based on SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H, respectively. These results provide evidence that the electron injection from photo-excited sensitizers to the conduction band of TiO2 occurs efficiently even though the driving potential for electron injection is less than 0.3 eV.

TAS (see Fig. S2, ESI†) of the devices, A and B were taken to explore the reduction dynamic/path of the oxidized dye. The dye regeneration life times (τ1 and τ2 corresponding to the reduction of oxidized dye molecules by I− in electrolyte and by the electrons in TiO2, respectively49,50) and the amplitude ratios for τ1 and τ2 are listed in Table 2. TAS data show that τ1 and τ2 for the device A and device B are not the same but that the τ1/τ2 amplitude ratios are similar. This result suggests that the ratio for reducing the oxidized dye by iodide in electrolyte and by electrons on the TiO2 is similar for devices A and B. Therefore, a higher Jsc for the device B compared to the device A is mainly because more CYC-B11H dye with a higher absorption coefficient was adsorbed on to TiO2 anode.

The characteristic I–V and IPCE curves of SJW-B18 and CYC-B11 sensitized devices (device C and D) based on [CoII/III(bipy)3]2/3+ (tris(4,4′-bipyridine)-cobalt(II/III), E0 = +0.62 V vs. NHE) electrolyte are shown in Fig. 5 and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3. The thickness of the TiO2 photoanode used in devices C and D are the same as those applied in I−/I3− based devices. As expected, using a thick TiO2 anode, the efficiency (especially Jsc) of the devices used [CoII/III(Bipy)3]2/3+ and the electrolyte are much lower than those for the devices based on the I−/I3− redox couple, because of the low mass transport rate related to the bulky size of Co(II/III) complexes and the fast charge recommendation because of the positive nature of cobalt electrolyte.24 The injected electron will recombine with the Co-electrolyte before diffusing in to the anode and the Co(III) diffuses slowly in to the cathode which accepts the electron and finishes the photo-to-electricity conversion process. IPCE curves for both devices, A and B also show that the efficiency is very low (<60%) for the whole measured wavelength. Nevertheless, SJW-B18 sensitized devices have a higher Voc compared to the CYC-B11H based device, which may be because the TiO2 anode in device C has better surface protection. To explore the surface coverage of TiO2, electrochemical impedance measurements (see Fig. S3, ESI†) of the devices C and D were performed under darkness. The values of the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the dyed TiO2/electrolyte interface estimated from the middle frequency semicircle are shown in Table 3. Device C has a higher Rct value suggesting that SJW-B18 dyed TiO2 has better surface protection. Furthermore, the IPCE curves for the devices based on Co(II/III) electrolyte with a thick TiO2 anode are very consistent with the absorption spectra of the dye adsorbed on TiO2 thin films (see Fig. 2a). These data suggested that the excited dye molecules can inject electrons into TiO2 efficiently after absorbing photons. Nevertheless only a small ratio of electrons on TiO2 can diffuse to the external circuit to produce electricity. Most injected electrons on TiO2 (especially those far away from the anode) recombined with Co(III) species in the electrolyte, because of the simple reduction of the Co(III) species and the slow diffusion rate of the bulky cobalt complex.

Optimizing the device by changing the thickness of the TiO2 anode and dye loading time, the J–V and IPCE curves of the optimized devices (device E and F) are shown in Fig. 6. The photovoltaic performance and the dye loading are also listed in Table 3. When the thickness of TiO2 was reduced from 12 + 4 μm to 4 + 4 μm and the dye loading time was decreased from 12 h to 3 h, the power conversion efficiency of the SJW-B18 sensitized device increased from 3.84% to 7.30%. The efficiency of the CYC-B11H sensitized device also increased from 3.89% to 6.65%. This is a general phenomenon when a cobalt redox couple was used as an electrolyte in DSSC: the highest efficiency occurs with a thinner TiO2 anode compared to the device used, the I−/I3− electrolyte. As mentioned previously, the characteristics of the cobalt electrolyte are a fast charge recombination with the electrons in TiO2 (or even in FTO51) because of its positive charge nature and slow diffusion rate (an order of magnitude slower than I3− in bulk solution) which contribute to the high mass of the cobalt complex, higher viscosity of the electrolyte and electrostatic surface interaction between the cobalt complex and the TiO2 film. When the thickness of the TiO2 film was used, more dye can be adsorbed and inject more electrons in to the TiO2 anode. However, the injected electrons on TiO2 far away from the FTO (or external circuit) will recombine with the cobalt electrolyte without contributing Jsc. On the other hand, TiO2 is a high band-gap semiconductor with low conductivity. A thicker film has higher resistance, therefore, it has a lower frictional force (FF), resulting in lower efficiency. As a result, the optimal TiO2 thickness for the device using cobalt electrolyte is thinner compared to the device based on iodine electrolyte. The efficiency of SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H sensitized devices is almost the same when the I−/I3− redox couple was used. On the other hand, when the cobalt complex was used as an electrolyte, the device sensitized by SJW-B18 has better photovoltaic performance, mainly resulting in higher Voc and FF, compared to that based on CYC-B11H.

SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H have a similar structure (see Fig. 1), orbital distribution and energy level of the frontier orbitals (HOMO and LUMO, Fig. 3 and Table 1). The driving force for injecting electron from the excited dye to the TiO2 anode and reducing the oxidized dye molecules by electrolyte is nearly the same. Transient absorption data (Table 2) of the devices based on the I−/I3− electrolyte discussed in the previous paragraph also revealed that the ratio of the effective reduction (by I− in the electrolyte and by electron in TiO2) of the oxidized dye molecules did not have a significant difference for SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H sensitized devices. The absorption profile of SJW-B18 adsorbed TiO2 thin film is also comparable to that for CYC-B11H dyed film (see Fig. 2). Furthermore, the absorption (dye loading times absorption coefficient of dye) for SJW-B18 on the TiO2 anode are even lower than the CYC-B11H sensitized TiO2 (Table 3). Therefore, the better photovoltaic performance of the SJW-B18-based device may be mainly attributed to the less charge recombination between the electrons on the TiO2 anode and the cobalt electrolyte. Charge recombination in DSSC was known to be dependent of the surface protection of the dye adsorbed TiO2 anode.46,52SJW-B18 with four alkyl groups on the terminal of the ancillary ligand can form better TiO2 surface protection compared to CYC-B11H which has only two alkyl groups on the ancillary ligand. Reducing the back charge recombination accounts for the improving in Voc and photovoltaic performance of the device based on the Co(II)/(III) redox couple evidently stems from the increase in the number of alkyl groups on the ancillary ligands of the ruthenium sensitizer.
3.4 Study the surface protection of the dye adsorbed TiO2 anode by EIS and IMPS/IMVS techniques
The evidence of the surface coverage for dyed TiO2 anodes in the devices, E and F comes from the electrochemical impedance data (see Fig. S3b, ESI†) taken under darkness. The simulated Rct values are listed in Table 3. The Rct for the SJW-B18-based device is larger than that for the device sensitized with CYC-B11H, suggesting that the interfacial back charge recombination of the electron on TiO2 with CoIII species is retarded when the sensitizer has more terminal alkyl groups, which may account for the higher Voc and η for the SJW-B18 sensitized device. In order to obtain more information about the surface protection of the dyed TiO2 anode, the IMPS/IMVS for both SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H sensitized devices (device C, D, E and F) were taken. IMPS data can provide the information regarding the diffusion of the electron in TiO2 and the lifetime of the electron in TiO2 can be derived from the IMVS results.53 For thick TiO2 anodes, the effective electron diffusion coefficient (Dn, see Fig. 7a) for the SJW-B18 sensitized device (device C) is smaller than that for CYC-B11H-based device (device D), because the former has less dye with a smaller absorption coefficient adsorbed on to the TiO2 (see Table 3). Nevertheless, Fig. 7b clearly illustrates that the life time (τn, obtained from the IMVS data) of the electrons on TiO2 is longer for the SJW-B18 sensitized device (device C) compared to device D. Longer electron lifetime indicated that less charge recombination occurs or there are more electrons on the TiO2 (the latter is not true because the absorption of SJW-B18 dyed TiO2 is weaker than that for the CYC-B11H adsorbed TiO2). Less charge recombination suggested that the SJW-B18 dyed TiO2 anode has better surface protection, which is consistent with EIS data.

When thin (4 + 4 μm) TiO2 anode was used, IMPS data (Fig. 8a) showed that the Dn for the SJW-B18 sensitized device (device E) is only slightly smaller than that for the CYC-B11H-based device (device F) and the Dn values for both device E and F are smaller than those for the devices, C and D (with a thick TiO2 anode). The Dn value depends on the quality of TiO2 and the number of injected electrons. A device with a thinner TiO2 anode was loaded with less dye molecules and, therefore, has a smaller Dn value. The absorption of the SJW-B18 dyed anode is only slightly lower than that of the CYC-B11H dyed TiO2 (see Table 3) therefore, the Dn values for the devices, C and D are also very close. Nevertheless, the Jsc for the devices, E and F with less dye on the TiO2 film (thin anode) is higher than that for the devices, C and D with more dye on the TiO2 film (thick anode, see Table 3). The results suggest that the most injected electrons on the thick TiO2 anode recombined with the cobalt electrolyte before diffusing to the FTO electrode. The τn values for the devices, E and F (using thin TiO2 anodes) are longer than those for the devices, C and D based on thick TiO2 films. That is why the Jsc for the devices with the thin anode are higher than those for the devices with the thick TiO2 film; even more electrons were injected in the thicker TiO2 anode upon the photo exciting of the dye molecules. The τn value for device E is longer than that for device F under all light intensities, indicating that device E has less charge recombination, which is because of the better surface protection of the TiO2 anode. The IMPS/IMVS data undeniably reveal the importance of the TiO2 surface protection when the high current density of the cobalt-based devices was expected and the protection of the sensitized TiO2 anode can be improved by simply adding more alkyl chains to the sensitizer.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we report the synthesis and photovoltaic performance of two new ruthenium sensitizers, SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H, which were specially designed to study the compatibility between the ruthenium dye and the cobalt electrolyte. These two ruthenium sensitizers have similar electronic and optical properties but SJW-B18 dye has four butyl chains in the terminal of the ancillary ligand and there are only two octyl chains in the ancillary ligand of the CYC-B11H dye. The conversion efficiencies based on the I−/I3− electrolyte for SJW-B18 and CYC-B11H sensitized devices (9.54% and 9.64%, respectively) are very close, and consistent with this, the two complexes have similar electronic and optical properties. However, when the Co(II)/(III) redox shuttle was used as an electrolyte, the device sensitized with SJW-B18 has higher Voc and η compared to CYC-B11H-based device. The better photovoltaic performance of the SJW-B18 sensitized device is mainly because the SJW-B18 dyed TiO2 anode has better surface protection from the four alkyl chains in the terminal of the ancillary ligand as shown by EIS and IMPS/IMVS data. The results provide a new strategy for developing high open-circuit voltage (without sacrificing Jsc) DSSCs by the structural design of the ruthenium sensitizer.
