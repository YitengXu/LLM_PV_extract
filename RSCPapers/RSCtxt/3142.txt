    AbstractAn imide-functionalized material, poly(oxyethylene)-segmented polymer, was synthesized from the reaction of poly(oxyethylene)diamine of 2000 g mol−1Mw and 4,4′-oxydiphthalic anhydride and used to disperse hybrid nanomaterials of platinum nanoparticles and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (PtNP/MWCNT). The composite material was spin-coated into film and further prepared as the counter electrode (PtNP/MWCNT-CE) for a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The short-circuit current density (JSC) and power-conversion efficiency (η) of the DSSC with PtNP/MWCNT-CE were found to be 18.01 ± 0.91 mA cm−2 and 8.00 ± 0.23%, respectively, while the corresponding values were 14.62 ± 0.19 mA cm−2 and 6.92 ± 0.07% for a DSSC with a bare platinum counter electrode (Pt-CE). The presence and distribution of PtNP/MWCNT on the CE were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The attachment of PtNPs on MWCNTs was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), incident-photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were correlated to explain the efficacy of this nanocomposite system.
Introduction
The main framework of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) consists of a dye-adsorbed nanocrystalline photoanode, an electrolyte, and a counter electrode (CE).1 High electrochemical activity of the CE is essential for high performance of the cell. Conventionally, a platinum (Pt) layer is coated on the conductive substrate of the CE, not only for obtaining a superior catalytic surface on the substrate, but also for minimizing the voltage loss due to charge transfer overpotential at the CE.2–4 When the CE has no catalytic layer, the power-conversion efficiency of the cell is negligible.5 The role of a catalytic layer on the CE of the DSSC is to catalyze the reduction of the I3− ions that are produced by the oxidation of iodide ions in the electrolyte by the oxidized dye.
The expensive source of the cathodic material, Pt, for the preparation of a CE is another factor to be considered for cost-effective fabrication of a DSSC, although Pt often shows high catalytic activity for I3− reduction and excellent electronic conductivity. Several other materials have been studied to replace Pt, such as carbon materials,6–11 conducting polymers,12,13 a graphene/conducting polymer composite,14 a conducting polymer/TiO2 composite,15 a carbon/TiO2 composite,16 and a conducting polymer/carbon nanotube composite.17 Among them, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are the most promising potential alternatives to be introduced as CE layers in DSSCs, owing to their inherent properties of high electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical strength. Several literature papers have reported the competitive performance of DSSCs using merely CNTs as CE materials.5,18,19 Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have also demonstrated promising results, attributable to their extraordinary specific surface area and rapid electron transfer nature.20,21
For this study, we prepared a CE by coating a fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) substrate with a composite material of platinum nanoparticles supported on MWCNTs (PtNP/MWCNT). This composite was spin-coated from the solution consisting of a novel compound, poly(oxyethylene)-segmented imide polymer (POEM) as a dispersant for the composite material; this imide-functionalized dispersant was synthesized by us by mixing poly(oxyethylene)diamine (POE2000) and 4,4′-oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA). The use of POE-backboned polymer dispersants allows the non-covalent blending of PtNPs with MWCNTs for enhancing the electro-catalytic ability of the composite layer on the CE. In literature, Han et al. employed a Pt/carbon composite consisting of Pt, graphite, and carbon black as the catalyst for the CE to fabricate an all-solid-state DSSC.22 In another report, the power-conversion efficiency (η) of a DSSC fabricated with a Pt/carbon black CE reached 6.72%, with reference to that of a DSSC with bare Pt electrode (η = 6.63%).23 By comparison, the η of the DSSC in this study reached as high as 8.00 ± 0.23% with the CE coated with the composite of platinum nanoparticles and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (PtNP/MWCNT-CE), with reference to that of a DSSC (η = 6.92 ± 0.07%) with a bare Pt CE (Pt-CE). The finely dispersed PtNP/MWCNT hybrid as nanocomposite on the CE was prepared. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the polymer-dispersed PtNPs as a CE with the composite film of MWCNTs and PtNPs for a DSSC, especially adopting a novel route for preparing this catalytic film. We further present a comprehensive study of the catalytic ability of PtNP/MWCNT-CE on DSSC, using the analyses involving TEM, SEM, EDS, XRD, CV, EIS, and AFM.
Experimental
Materials
Multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were obtained from Seedchem Company Pty., Ltd. The average dimensions of the MWCNTs were estimated to be 40–60 nm in diameter and 0.5–10 μm in length. Poly(oxyethylene)diamine or poly(oxypropylene–oxyethylene–oxypropylene)-segmented polyether of bis(2-aminopropyl ether), with a Mw = 2000 g mol−1 (POE2000) was a crystalline and water-soluble material (waxy solid, melting point = 37–40 °C, amine content 0.95 milli-equivalent g−1 with an average 39 oxyethylene and 6 oxypropylene units in the structure). 4,4′-Oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA, 97% purity) and nitric acid (HNO3, 65%) were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co.; the ODPA was further purified through sublimation. Dihydrogen hexachloroplatinate (H2PtCl6, ACS, Premion, 99.95%) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 98%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co. Anhydrous LiI, I2, acetonitrile (AN) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, Mw = 20000) were received from Merck. Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, +98%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 96%), and tert-butanol (TBA, 99.5%) were obtained from Acros. 3-Methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95–97%) were products from Fluka. cis-Bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) bis-tetrabutylammonium (so-called N719), 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), and fluorine-doped SnO2 glass (FTO, sheet resistivity = 15 Ω square−1) were obtained from Solaronix S. A., Aubonne, Switzerland.
Synthesis of poly(oxyethylene)-segmented imide (POEM)
The POEM polymer was synthesized from the reaction of POE2000 and ODPA at a molar ratio of 6:5, by the procedures described below: POE2000 (10.00 g, 0.005 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (15 ml) was poured into a 100 ml three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, nitrogen inlet-outlet lines, and a thermometer; a solution of ODPA (1.29 g, 0.004 mol) in THF (10 ml) was added to the reactor through a funnel in a drop-wise manner. During the addition, the mixture was stirred vigorously and the reactor was maintained at 150 °C for 3 h. The product mixtures were subjected to rotary evaporation under a reduced pressure and recovered as a yellowish waxy solid. During the process, samples were taken periodically and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. It showed that the absorption peaks of the anhydride functionality at 1780 cm−1 (s) and 1850 cm−1 (w) disappeared at the expense of the peaks at 1713 and 1773 cm−1 for the asymmetric stretch of imide. The characteristic absorption at 1100 cm−1 of oxyalkylene was observed.
Preparation of PtNP/MWCNT nanocomposite
The composition of platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) with MWCNTs was accomplished by an in situ reduction of H2PtCl6 in the presence of MWCNTs using the dispersant POEM in an aqueous media. The MWCNTs (0.036 g) were first dispersed in 7.11 g of deionized water in a vial and sonicated under a VCX 500 Ultrasonicator at ambient temperature for 15 min. The resultant solution was dark black with some solid precipitate at the bottom of the container, indicating a low degree of dispersion. In a separate glass container, POEM (1.0 g) and H2PtCl6 (1.0 g, 0.0024 mol) were dissolved in 5.14 g of deionized water and added to the MWCNTs/deionized water (7.11 g) solution. A homogenous suspension of MWCNTs was obtained by mixing in the presence of POEM and H2PtCl6. PtNPs were then generated by slowly adding 0.7 wt% of NaBH4 (0.007 g) in 1 g deionized water by the reduction from H2PtCl6. This dispersion was further stirred for several hours at ambient temperature and monitored using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), evidencing the attachment of PtNPs on MWCNTs’ surfaces.
Preparation of PtNP/MWCNT-coated counter electrode
The above obtained PtNP/MWCNT solution was spin-coated on a FTO glass substrate at 2000 rpm for 30 s and the formed film was annealed at 350 °C for about 20 min in atmosphere. The PtNP/MWCNT-coated FTO glass was used as the counter electrode.
Preparation of MWCNTs-coated FTO substrate
The MWCNTs (0.05 g) were added to an acid solution (40 ml) containing 3:1 of H2SO4:HNO3 by volume,24 followed by continuous stirring of the contents for three days. After stirring, the solution consisting of acid-treated MWCNTs was filtrated through a filter (Anodisc 47, Whatman International Ltd, Maidstone, England). Thus, MWCNTs attached with carboxylic groups were prepared. The carboxylic group-functionalized MWCNTs were then well-dispersed in the deionized water at a concentration of 1 mg ml−1.25 Both electrophoretic and spray deposition methods could be used to deposit uniform MWCNTs thin film.18,26 In this study, the MWCNTs were deposited onto the FTO substrate by spraying, keeping the FTO glass at 400 °C.
Fabrication of the DSSC
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) was hydrolyzed to obtain TiO2 in a media containing HNO3 by adopting a sol–gel method. Then, the TiO2 solution was autoclaved through hydrothermal process at 240 °C for 12 h. By concentrating the autoclaved solution to 13 wt%, a paste of nanocrystalline TiO2 was obtained. To prevent the paste from cracking and to control the pore size of TiO2, 30 wt% of PEG corresponding to the amount of TiO2 was added to the paste.27 The photoanode of the DSSC was prepared through the following procedure: the TiO2 paste produced above was coated on an FTO using a doctor-blade method, followed by annealing the TiO2-coated FTO at 450 °C for 30 min. After such coating and sintering twice, a third layer of TiO2 was coated which contained light scattering particles of size 300 nm, and the sintering was performed in the same way. A TiO2 area of 0.16 cm2 was selected as the active area and was dipped overnight in a solution containing 3 × 10−4 M N719 dye in acetonitrile–tert-butanol (1:1 in volume ratio). The DSSC was assembled with the photoanode and the CE (PtNPs/MWCNTs-CE or sputtered Pt-CE), keeping a distance of 25 μm between them by using Surlyn (Solaronix) as the spacer and injecting the electrolyte, containing 0.6 M DMPII, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP dissolved in MPN, through a hole between the photoanode and the CE by a capillary method.
Instrumentation
FT-IR spectra were obtained by a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer. The samples for FT-IR were prepared on KBr plates and measurements were performed in the range of 800–4000 cm−1. PtNP/MWCNTs nanocomposites in the dispersion were observed using a TEM (JOEL JEM-1230 electron microscope, operating at 100 kV and photographed with a Gatan DualVision CCD Camera). The sample for TEM was prepared by dropping the sample solution on a copper grid coated with a carbon film. An energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) equipped in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (NovaTM NanoSEM 230) was used for identifying the elements in the composite sample. Observations with plane and cross-sectional views of the samples were made using a field-emission scanning electronic microscopy (FE-SEM, Zeiss EM 902A) at 10 kV. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, NanoScope) was employed to estimate the roughness of the substrates using a probe of tapping mode (NCH-10, resonance frequency = 320 kHz, force constant = 42 N m−1, NanoWorld). X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert, Philips) was utilized to analyze the crystalline orientations of the samples. The surface of the DSSC was illuminated by a class A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc.) and the incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard silicon cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). The photoelectrochemical characteristics of the DSSCs were recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco-Chemie, Netherlands). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained by the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with an FRA2 module, under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 150 kHz to 1 Hz, with an applied voltage of 0.01 V. Impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model. The catalytic ability of the CEs were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV), equipped with a three-electrode system (CH Instruments). Incident-photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the DSSCs were measured using a monochromator (model 74125, Cornerstone™ 260 1 4−1 m, Newport) with a light source of 1000 W (Sciencetech). Surface conductivity measurements of the films were made with a Keithley 2000 multimeter, containing a four-point probe. Transmittance of a sample was measured by an UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (V-570, Jasco).
Results and discussion
The POEM polymer was prepared from POE2000 and ODPA in a 6:5 molar ratio at a temperature of 150 °C. The idealized structure of the resultant polymer, consisting of alternative POE (–CH2CH2O–)x and aromatic imide (–CONCO–) segments is presented in Scheme 1. The estimated molecular weight of the POEM is about 39000 g mol−1 by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with a water apparatus (515 HPLC pump, 717 auto sampler, 2410 refractive index detector). The POEM polymer possesses a high dispersing ability due to the presence of POE segments for solvating both MWCNTs and Pt nanoparticles. During the dispersing and reducing processes, the mixtures of H2PtCl6 and MWCNTs were affected by POEM in aqueous media assisted mechanically at ambient temperature. The formation of PtNPs on MWCNTs, as well as in the solution, was characterized by using TEM, SEM and EDS. The reducing ability of NaBH4 for transforming chloroplatinate (PtCl62−) into PtNPs was reported.28

Fig. 1a shows a photograph of the container with the slurry of MWCNTs, PtNPs, H2PtCl6, POEM in water; the slurry was homogeneous without any grainy aggregates on the glass sidewall. Fig. 1b is a TEM micrograph of the MWCNTs in the slurry showing MWCNTs with PtNPs decoration by an additional clear image in the inset. The generated PtNPs were homogeneous with a pore size distribution of 3.0 to 5.0 nm. Fig. 2a and 2b show the plane view images of the sputtered Pt and the sprayed MWCNTs on FTO substrates, respectively, while Fig. 2c shows PtNP/MWCNT on FTO, and Fig. 2d shows the magnified version. Fig. 2b shows the fiber-like morphology of the MWCNTs thin film, in contrast to that in Fig. 2a, which exhibits plenty of tiny grains of Pt distributed uniformly throughout the FTO substrate. In the case of the film with the PtNP/MWCNT composite (Fig. 2c), the picture of MWCNTs attached with PtNPs is more clearly observed in the magnified version (Fig. 2d). The PtNPs in Fig. 2c and 2d are identified by energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) mapping (ESI†). The photographs in the insets of Fig. 2a–c are the images of Pt/FTO, MWCNT/FTO, and PtNP/MWCNT/FTO, respectively. Light reflection can be seen on Pt/FTO (Fig. 2a), corresponding to the distinctive properties of a metal (Pt). In addition, the uniform MWCNTs film (Fig. 2b) coated by the spraying technique on the FTO has a darkened appearance, attributable to the MWCNTs. On the other hand, the word “NTU” appears clearly through PtNP/MWCNT/FTO (Fig. 2c), because of the transparent nature of this composite film (transmittance, T% = 40–50%), the word NTU is written on paper and is placed behind this PtNP/MWCNT/FTO; this transmittance was measured under the region of the visible light spectrum.

The PtNP/MWCNT/FTO composite film electrode is indeed more transparent than the Pt/FTO electrode (T% = 10–20%) and the darkened MWCNT/FTO. The semi-transparency of PtNP/MWCNT/FTO (Fig. 2c) is obviously due to the spin coating technique used in this case, and due to the MWCNTs that hamper the formation of a compact film on the FTO. The less transparent nature of Pt/FTO (Fig. 2a) on the contrary is probably due the sputter-coating technique used in this case, where aggregates of pure PtNPs can form a compact Pt film.
The PtNP/MWCNT film was further characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement (Fig. 3) for verifying the crystallization of PtNPs on the MWCNTs. The XRD pattern of PtNP/MWCNT film shows four specific peaks of 2θ at 39.4°, 46.0°, 67.4°, and 81.1° corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311) orientations of the platinum lattice,23 respectively.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of MWCNT/FTO and PtNP/MWCNT/FTO. 
Thus, the presence of PtNPs is consistent with that observed by the EDS mapping (ESI†).
The performance of the DSSC with PtNP/MWCNT-CE was studied in comparison to that of a DSSC with Pt-CE (Fig. 4). The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and in the dark. The short-circuit current density (JSC) of the DSSC with Pt-CE is 14.62 ± 0.19 mA cm−2, and its power-conversion efficiency (η) is 6.92 ± 0.07%. The DSSC with PtNP/MWCNT-CE, on the contrary, rendered a JSC of 18.01 ± 0.91 mA cm−2 and an η of 8.00 ± 0.23% (Table 1). The higher JSC and η for the cell with PtNP/MWCNT-CE is obviously due to higher catalytic ability for I3− reduction of its CE, resulting from its favorable surface morphology. In absence of any change in the photoanodes of the cells and their electrolytes, the VOC of the cells remains almost the same, as also verified by the same dark currents for the cells. Fig. 4 also shows the incident-photo-to-current efficiencies (IPCE) of the DSSCs with Pt-CE and PtNP/MWCNT-CE. The two DSSCs exhibit almost the same IPCE values, as expected in absence of any change in the photoanodes of the cells.

Cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis of Pt-CE and PtNP/MWCNT-CE were performed to characterize the electrodes. The CV in Fig. 5 shows an anodic peak current (Ipa) and a cathodic peak current (Ipc) corresponding to the oxidation of I− ions and the reduction of I3− ions, respectively. The kinetic reaction at the heterogeneous interface of the CE and the electrolyte for a DSSC is represented as following: I3− + 2e− → 3I−(1)

The magnitude of the Ipc can, thus, express the catalytic ability of a CE for I3− reduction in a DSSC. The Ipc of the PtNP/MWCNT-CE is clearly larger than that of the Pt-CE, revealing its higher electro-catalytic ability than the Pt-CE. The catalytic properties of the CEs were also studied by using EIS (Fig. 6).

The results were obtained by using two identical CEs with a working area of 1 cm2 in a symmetric cell.11 The electrolyte was the same as used for a DSSC in this research. The series resistance (Rs) of a symmetric cell was measured at the frequency of 100 kHz, while the frequency between 10 kHz and 100 Hz was used to estimate the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the cell. The Rct of the cell with PtNP/MWCNT-CE was obtained from its corresponding semicircle in Fig. 6 by taking a half of the value corresponding to the semi-circle, and was found to be 0.28 ± 0.03 Ω cm2. In a similar way, the Rct of the cell with the Pt-CE was calculated and found to be 0.50 ± 0.04 Ω cm2 (Table 2). The lower Rct value of the symmetric cell with PtNP/MWCNT-CE is due to the higher catalytic ability of the CE in this symmetric cell for the reduction of I3−, compared to that of the CE in the symmetric cell with Pt-CEs.

These EIS values are consistent with the observation made with the CVs in Fig. 5. Thus, it is now established that PtNP/MWCNT-CE has a better catalytic ability for the I3− reduction than Pt-CE. The symmetric cell with PtNP/MWCNT-CE, however, shows a higher Rs value of 22.9 ± 0.24 Ω cm2 and a corresponding lower electrical conductivity (σ) of (1.96 ± 0.09) × 103 S cm−1, compared to the respective values of 20.35 ± 0.47 Ω cm2 and (17.15 ± 1.26) × 103 S cm−1 of the cell with Pt-CE; this phenomenon is to be attributed to the inherently high conducting property of the metallic Pt in comparison with the composite film of PtNP/MWCNT.
To gain insight into the catalytic ability of the PtNP/MWCNT-CE, investigations on the surface configuration and morphologies of the CEs were made by using AFM and FE-SEM. From the AFM image of Fig. 7a, it can be seen that the surface configuration of the Pt-CE displays lots of island-like shapes, suggesting uniform distribution of sputtered Pt particles on the FTO glass. In the case of PtNP/MWCNT-CE (Fig. 7b), small irregular particles and some rod-like particles (MWCNTs) appear with pores and gaps among them, indicating that the surface is not completely covered with the coating, which is consistent with the observation that the light-transmittance is higher than that of the Pt-CE (insets of Fig. 2a and 2c). The irregularities and gaps in the case of PtNP/MWCNT-CE are not only caused by different shapes of the materials, i.e., PtNPs and MWCNTs, but also by the random deposition of these materials from the spin-coating method on the substrate.

In addition, root-mean-square roughness (Rms) values of the surfaces were obtained to be 10.38 ± 0.09 and 22.69 ± 5.01 nm, respectively, for Pt-CE and PtNP/MWCNT-CE, as summarized in Table 2. These values clearly indicate that the nanocomposite film is rougher and, thus, has lager surface area than the Pt film. The actual appearances of the roughness of these two different electrodes were further compared by FE-SEM cross-sectional images (Fig. 7c and 7d). The former (Pt-CE) shows a few humps on a relatively smooth surface compared to the latter (PtNP/MWCNT-CE), which has large and disordered projections of MWCNTs among PtNPs. Besides, from the plane view images of Fig. 7e and 7f, the rougher surface of PtNP/MWCNT-CE is observed and reasoned for rendering a larger surface area for I3− reduction. It should be mentioned here that the thickness of the sputtered Pt-CE is 48.43 ± 1.53 nm, as measured by a Tenco Alpha-step profilometer. According to the SEM images, the sputtered Pt layer with this thickness is rather uniform and flat, which can be considered as a typical Pt used in DSSC. However, the surface morphology of the PtNP/MWCNT-CE is non-uniform and very rough, as judged by both AFM (Rms value) and FE-SEM. In fact, Zhou et al. have observed that the enhanced catalytic current for the reduction of I3− was closely related to a larger electrochemical active surface area and a smaller Pt crystallite size.29,30 Without the detailed analysis on the PtNPs size, we speculate that the surface roughness plays the dominating factor for the differences in performance in our study. In consequence, the DSSC fabricated with the PtNP/MWCNT-CE exhibits a high catalytic ability on its CE resulting in high JSC and the unprecedentedly high η.
Conclusions
In this study, a well-dispersed composite solution of PtNP/MWCNT was prepared by using a newly synthesized polymer, POEM, as the dispersant. The CE for a DSSC was fabricated by coating the solution into films. The fine dispersion of PtNP/MWCNT hybrid on the CE was confirmed by SEM, TEM, EDS, XRD, and AFM. On the CV and EIS analyses, the higher catalytic ability of PtNP/MWCNT-CE than that of Pt-CE has been observed. An enhancement in JSC (from 14.62 ± 0.19 to 18.01 ± 0.91 mA cm−2) and η (from 6.92 ± 0.07 to 8.00 ± 0.23%) for the DSSC with PtNP/MWCNT-CE was accomplished, with reference to the values of a DSSC assembled with a Pt-CE. From the investigations on the surface morphologies of the CEs, it is concluded that PtNP/MWCNT-CE has a rougher surface and consequently higher catalytic ability than those of Pt-CE. The significant improvement of the DSSC performance has been achieved for using PtNP/MWCNT-CE in the cell fabrication.
