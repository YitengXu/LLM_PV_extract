In the film, PCDTBT effectively suppresses the over aggregation of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 donor phase and promotes formation of percolating networks between the donor and acceptor phases. Moreover, the portion of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites with the face-on orientation in the blend film is significantly increased and phase separation is decreased, which enables efficient charge generation and transport. Consequently, these solar cells consistently exhibit high fill factors and photocurrent densities and high efficiencies in the range 6.68–8.13% regardless of the DIO content (0.4–3 v/v%). In contrast, a large variation was found in the performance of the solar cells with blend films processed with DIO alone, with efficiencies of 2.75–6.68% depending on the DIO content. More importantly, the PCDTBT-processed solar cells exhibit remarkably improved stability under heating and 65 °C/85% RH. Thus, processing photoactive layers utilizing a combination of DIO and PCDTBT is an effective way of preparing promising small molecule solar cells: DIO promotes the crystallinity of the donor phase, and the intermolecular interactions between the polymer and the push–pull moiety in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 induce distribution of donor crystallites to form percolating networks by suppressing donor over-segregation.
Introduction
Important developments in solution-processable small molecule bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have resulted in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ∼10%, which are very comparable to those of polymer BHJ solar cells.1–6 Small molecule photovoltaics (SM-PVs) have many advantages over polymer solar cells, including well-defined molecular structures, high reproducibility in molecular syntheses, and facile control of the optical and electrical properties of the small molecules through the design of specific chemical structures.7–13 This remarkable improvement in their PCEs and their superior properties suggest that SM-PVs should play an important role in the organic solar cell research field.14–17 However, it is not easy to optimize the morphologies of SM-PVs for efficient charge generation and transport, which limits their performances. The main problem is the formation of photoactive layers that are inadequate because of the low crystallinity of the small molecule donors and problematic phase separation between the small molecules and [6,6]-phenylC71butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).18–20
A number of processing techniques for the control of the blend film morphology have been tested, such as solvent annealing, thermal annealing, annealing with high boiling point solvents, and so on.21–23 Thermal annealing and solvent annealing effectively promote the crystallization of small molecule donors and the phase separation of the donor and the acceptor in the BHJ films of SM-PVs.24–28 Of these methods, processing with solvent additives is the most widely employed technique for preparing high performing SM-PVs and conjugated polymer:fullerene solar cells. High boiling point solvents such as 1,2-diiodooctane (DIO) can selectively dissolve fullerene derivatives and facilitate the aggregation of the donor molecules into crystallites to improve the purity of the donor domains.29,30 For example, a BHJ film comprising of 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5yl)-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) and PC71BM was found to exhibit a remarkably improved solar cell performance when DIO was mixed into the chlorobenzene (CB) casting solution.31 Without this solvent additive treatment, the solar cell device exhibited a PCE of 4.5%, but when 0.25 v/v% of DIO was added into the precursor solution for the active layer coating, a PCE of 6.7% was obtained.32 The other interesting aspect of solvent additives is that processing p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM with excess DIO (0.8 v/v%) in the precursor solution results in over-aggregation of the donor phase, which disrupts the percolating pathways for charge transport.33 This over-aggregation also reduces the donor/acceptor interface area and as a result decreases charge generation and the photocurrent density. Meanwhile, the addition of small amounts of conjugated or nonconjugated polymers into the SM-PV casting solution has also been shown to enhance device performance.34,35 The presence of polymer additives such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or polythiophene (P3HT) results in an increase in the nucleation density of small molecules and thus in the crystallinity of the donors in the active layer.36,37 However, Cheun et al. have reported that PDMS reduces the surface roughness of the blend film rather than enhancing the donor's crystallinity.36 Although the exact function of polymers in small molecule BHJs is unclear and is dependent on their chemical structures, it is believed that the specific interactions between the small molecules and the polymer can have important effects on the morphologies of BHJ films.34–39 In particular, an appropriate combination of polymers and solvent additives can synergistically improve the morphological properties of small molecular BHJ films.32–40
In this study, we introduced a polymer and a solvent additive into a p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film and investigated how the combination of these polymer and solvent additives affects the BHJ film morphology and the photovoltaic properties of the resulting small molecule BHJ solar cell. The solvent additive DIO and the polymer PCDTBT (Fig. 1(a)) were selected and included in the blend film. PCDTBT is expected to have favourable molecular interactions with p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 because it has a push–pull unit with a chemical structure that is similar to that of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. Further, the amorphous nature of PCDTBT is expected to ensure that the polymer is well distributed and does not aggregate in the BHJ film. We demonstrated that PCDTBT and DIO have synergistic effects on the formation of the BHJ film: DIO promotes the growth of the crystalline fibril structure and PCDTBT induces the formation of a morphology consisting of well-connected percolating networks with the required phase separation between the donor and acceptor phases in the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film. Interestingly, the morphology of the blend film processed with 3 v/v% DIO and PCDTBT is superior to that of the blend film processed with DIO alone. Depending on the DIO content, the efficiency of the SM-PVs prepared with DIO alone varies from 2.75% to 6.68%, whereas the devices with blend films processed with DIO and PCDTBT have relatively high efficiencies in the range 6.68–8.13%. More importantly, the PCDTBT-processed solar cells exhibit significantly improved stability under heating and at 65 °C/85% relative humidity (RH). We investigated the individual and cooperative effects of PCDTBT and DIO on the BHJ morphology and on the resulting solar cell performance and device stability.

Results and discussion
2.1. Photovoltaic properties of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ solar cells
We fabricated solar cell devices with a device structure of ITO/polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE)/p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag (Fig. 1(b)). The photoactive layer was fabricated by spin-casting a solution of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM in a CB:DIO cosolvent. The detailed procedure of device fabrication can be found in the Experimental section of the ESI.† The J–V characteristics of the devices processed with various contents of DIO in chlorobenzene (0%, 0.4%, 1.0%, and 3% v/v) are shown in Fig. 2(a). The performances of the SM-PV devices vary significantly with the amount of added DIO. The short-circuit current density (JSC) is 8.59 mA cm−2 when the device is processed without DIO but increases to 14.46 mA cm−2 when 0.4 v/v% DIO is added as a solvent additive. The fill factor (FF) also increases from 33.69% to 60.0% when 0.4 v/v% DIO is added to the solvent. However, when more DIO is added (1 and 3 v/v%), JSC and FF drop remarkably to JSC = 8.18 mA cm−2 and FF = 50.61% for 1 v/v% DIO and JSC = 7.40 mA cm−2 and FF = 45.48% for 3 v/v% DIO. The averaged open-circuit voltages (VOC) of the 21 devices with 0, 0.4, 1, and 3 v/v% DIO are 0.81 V, 0.78 V, 0.77 V, and 0.71 V, respectively. VOC is gradually decreased with adding more DIO though the solar cells using 0.4 and 1 v/v% DIO exhibit similar VOC values to each other. We will discuss reasons for the VOC change in detail in the film morphology description part. The optimal device performance was found to be a PCE of 6.68% when 0.4 v/v% DIO is used and drastically decreases with increases in the amount of added DIO: the PCEs obtained when 1 and 3 v/v% DIO are added to the processing solvent are 3.29% and 2.49% respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and characteristic parameters of the solar cells are shown in Fig. 2(b) and Table 1 respectively. We also fabricated solar cell devices by adding small amounts of PCDTBT into the BHJ film while keeping the other fabrication conditions constant. The amounts of PCDTBT (w% by total solid weight) are optimal with respect to performance when they are 2, 6, and 20 w% for the devices with 0.4, 1, and 3 v/v% DIO, respectively. It is found that a larger amount of PCDTBT is necessary to achieve a high efficiency when the ratio of DIO increases. The increased DIO may induce a larger degree of crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and phase separation33 and thus, more PCDTBT is required to provide a counter driving force which suppresses the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and thus prevents over-aggregation. Interestingly, the performances of all solar cell devices are improved by the addition of PCDTBT, although the degree of enhancement varies with the DIO content, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and Table 1. The 0.4 v/v% DIO solar cell exhibits the best solar cell performance: the highest measured PCE value of 8.14%, a JSC of 15.37 mA cm−2, a FF of 66.36%, and a VOC of 0.80 V; next best is the 1 v/v% DIO device with a PCE of 6.84%, a JSC of 13.59 mA cm−2, a FF of 62.54%, and a VOC of 0.81 V. The 3 v/v% DIO device exhibits the lowest efficiency but this performance is much better than that of the device processed without PCDTBT, which exhibits a PCE of 6.68%, a JSC of 12.59 mA cm−2, a FF of 65.07%, and a VOC of 0.82 V. Such performance enhancement might not be due to light harvesting enhancement which is usually observed in a ternary organic solar cell.41 The energy bandgap of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 (Eg = 1.78 eV) is very similar to that of PCDTBT (Eg = 1.8 eV) and thus, there may not be any significant change in the light harvesting degree of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PCDTBT:PC71BM system. We also fabricated the corresponding solar cell devices with PCDTBT but without DIO and compared their solar cell properties; all of these devices consistently exhibit low efficiencies in the range 2.5–3.5%. Therefore, the efficiency improvement is not due only to the addition of PCDTBT but rather to the combined effects of PCDTBT and DIO. Note that the variation with the DIO content in the performance of the PCDTBT-processed devices is much less than that of the solar cells processed with DIO alone. In particular, the solar cells containing PCDTBT exhibit similarly high FFs in the range 62.54–66.36% regardless of the DIO content, in contrast to the solar cells processed in the absence of PCDTBT (33.69–60.00%) (Fig. 2(e)). It is expected that charge recombination, which is usually observed in SM-PVs with high DIO contents, is greatly reduced in solar cell devices prepared using DIO together with PCDTBT.

We studied the variation of JSC as a function of illumination intensity to understand the charge recombination mechanism. The dependence of JSC on the light intensity is show in Fig. 2(f) and the data (symbols) are plotted on a log–log scale and fitted to a power law (solid lines). Generally, a power law dependence of JSC upon light intensity (JSC ∝ Iα) is observed in organic solar cells. Here, the exponential factor α = 1 is indicative of efficient sweep-out of carriers prior to recombination.42 We determined the exponential factor (α) for the device processed with different contents of DIO and PCDTBT. As shown in Fig. 2(f), the α values of the solar cells with PCDTBT are 0.962 and 0.950 for 0.4 v/v% DIO/2 w% PCDTBT and 1 v/v% DIO/6 w% PCDTBT, respectively, which are higher values compared with those of the corresponding solar cell devices without PCDTBT: the α values of 0 v/v%, 0.4 v/v%, and 1 v/v% DIO are 0.910, 0.960, and 0.929, respectively. From the result, it is expected that the charge recombination is most severe in the solar cell device processed without any additive, which is followed by the solar cell with only 1 v/v% DIO and the solar cell prepared with 0.4 v/v% DIO and 6 w% PCDTBT may show the most negligible charge recombination. Also, the improved balance between hole and electron transport in the solar cell device may contribute to the FF enhancement. The ratio of charge mobilities obtained using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model, electron mobility/hole mobility (e/h), is summarized in Table S1.† The solar cell device with 0.4 v/v% DIO/2 w% PCDTBT, which achieves the highest FF, shows a ratio relatively close to 1, indicating the good charge transport balance. As a result, it is expected that the solar cell fabricated using 0.4 v/v% DIO (e/h = 1.68, FF = 60.00%) exhibits better charge transport balance compared with that with no DIO additive (e/h = 2.16, FF = 33.69%). When both 0.4 v/v% DIO and 2 w% PCDTBT are used, the charge balance is more improved (e/h = 1.25, FF = 66.36%).
2.2. 
          p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ film morphology
We characterized the morphologies of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM composite films processed with various contents of DIO by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The films were prepared under the same conditions as in the device fabrications; Fig. 3 shows TEM images of the blend films processed with various contents of DIO in the solvent. In the film processed without any additive, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM are homogeneously mixed and there is no obvious sign of phase separation (Fig. S1(a) in the ESI†). When small amounts of PCDTBT were added into the film without DIO, there are no significant changes in the morphology regardless of the weight ratio of PCDTBT (Fig. S1(b)–(d)†). This result indicates that the addition of PCDTBT alone does not have any significant influence on the morphology of the blend film. The incorporation of 0.4 v/v% DIO into the solvent results in a significant change in the morphologies of the films. In Fig. 3(a), the fibrillar structures with domains that are approximately 20 nm wide and up to 40 nm long are randomly oriented, as previously reported by Bazan et al.31 The corresponding energy-filtered transmission electron micrographs (EF-TEMs) were also analysed. EF-TEM can provide a higher contrast because it selectively provides images with electrons that have lost characteristic amounts of energy. Fig. 3(g) shows an EF-TEM image that provides thickness-corrected elemental mappings of carbon in red, associated predominantly with PC71BM-rich phases, and silicon in green, corresponding to a small-molecule-rich phase; the morphology consists of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2- and PC71BM-rich domains interconnected by percolating networks. When 2 w% PCDTBT is added into the blend film, the fibril size is slightly decreased; the corresponding EF-TEM image in Fig. 3(h) shows that the intermixing of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM domains has improved and that the network structure is retained. This result explains why the FF and JSC values of the blend film fabricated with 2 w% PCDTBT and 0.4 v/v% DIO are better than those obtained when only 0.4 v/v% DIO is used; FF and JSC increase from 60.0% and 14.46 mA cm−2 to 66.36% and 15.37 mA cm−2 respectively. Further increases in the DIO content (1 and 3 v/v%) result in much larger and irregular domains with fibril size up to 1 μm length. These increases are clear in the EF-TEM images: the green p-DTS(FBTTh2)2-rich phases are much larger and more distinctive than those found in the 0.4 v/v% DIO blend film and are localized. Our comparison of the TEM and EF-TEM results indicates that the dark aggregates in the TEM images are PC71BM-rich phases. Interestingly, when small amounts of PCDTBT are added into the blend film, the degree of phase separation between p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM is more decreased.
 Fig. 3  (a) to (f) TEM and (g) to (l) EF-TEM images of SM:PC71BM films prepared with various DIO and PCDTBT contents. 
This outcome is clearly evident in the corresponding EF-TEM image, in which the green p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 area is better distributed and intermixed with the red PC71BM area than in the EF-TEM image before PCDTBT addition (Fig. 3(i) vs. (j) and (k) vs. (l)). This increased p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/PC71BM interface area and the improved continuity of the networks between the donor and acceptor domains mean that the solar cell exhibits enhanced performance; for example, the FF and JSC of the solar cell processed with 1 v/v% DIO improve to 30% and 60% respectively upon PCDTBT addition. As a result, the dependence of the film morphology on the DIO content of the solvent, i.e., a large amount of DIO increases the degree of phase separation, is more reduced and thus the solar cell devices retain relatively good properties despite variation in the DIO content. In particular, the FF values of the solar cells vary little with the DIO content.
The crystalline structures of the films were characterized by obtaining the GIXD patterns of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM films prepared with 0, 0.4, 1.0, and 3.0 v/v% DIO in the film casting solution, as shown in Fig. S2.† In these 2D-GIXD patterns, qxy and qz are the in-plane and out-of-plane components of the scattering vector q respectively; these components are normal to the plane of incidence and the sample surface plane respectively.43–45 In the case of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM film without DIO, only broad ring patterns that arise from the (100) reflection of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 are present, whereas the patterns of films prepared with DIO (Fig. S2(b)–(d)†) contain multiple (n00) reflections, up to the fourth order. Additionally, (010) reflections at qxy and qz = ∼1.73 Å−1 are evident in the in-plane and out-of-plane intensity profiles, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). These reflections are attributed to the formation of π–π stacking (π-stacking distance ∼ 3.6 Å).32,39,40 (100) and (010) reflections attributed to lamellar and π–π stacking are simultaneously observed in both the out-of-plane and in-plane intensity profiles, which confirms that the crystallites in the films of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM with and without DIO have a mixture of orientations including face-on and edge-on orientations. The out-of-plane intensity profile of the film processed without DIO only contains a weak and a broad (100) reflection at qz ≈ 0.36 Å−1, whereas those of the films processed with DIO consistently contain (n00) reflections at qz ≈ 0.27, 0.54, 0.81 and 0.104 Å−1. These multiple reflections mean that films processed with DIO have much higher crystallinity than those processed without DIO. Additionally, the characteristic reflections of the films prepared with DIO have almost identical positioning, which indicates that the π–π stacking distance and lamellar spacing do not vary from film to film. However, the (010) reflection due to the face-on orientation weakens significantly as the DIO content increases, which is mainly due to decreases in the proportion of crystallites with the face-on orientation. To elucidate the crystalline orientation, the azimuthal intensity scan of (100) reflections is displayed as shown in Fig. S2(e).† For all DIO contents, the relative intensity of the peak due to the edge-on orientation (0 < χ < 45°) is higher than that due to the face-on orientation (45 < χ < 90°), which indicates that the preferential orientation of the crystallites in all the films is edge-on. As the DIO content increases, the proportion of crystallites in the face-on orientation significantly decreases. Fig. S3(a)–(c)† show the 2D-GIXD patterns of the blend films prepared with various levels of PCDTBT, and the corresponding intensity profiles are presented in Fig. 4(c) and (d). We compared the positions of the characteristic π–π stacking and lamella spacing peaks, and found that the positions of the peaks are almost identical for all polymer and DIO contents, although the peak sharpness does vary. A quantitative analysis of the crystal structures of the blend film was obtained by performing azimuthal scan analyses of the (100) reflections in the blend films; the relative proportions of crystallites with the face-on orientation are shown in Fig. S3(d).† Overall, as more PCDTBT and DIO are added, the orientation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites in the blend film becomes more random and the proportion of face-on oriented molecules increases, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d) and S3(d).†Fig. 4(e) shows the proportions of crystallites with the face-on orientation in all films as a function of the DIO content. As more DIO is added into the processing solution, the proportion of crystallites with the face-on orientation in the blend films without PCDTBT rapidly decreases whereas the films with PCDTBT contain larger proportions of the face-on orientation. The crystallographic parameters, including the proportions of crystallites with face-on orientations and the correlation lengths (Lc) at the (100) reflection, are summarized in Table 2. The Lc values were calculated from the full widths at half-maximum (fwhms) of the (100) reflections with the Scherrer equation (Lc = 2(ln2/π)1/22π(Δq)−1, where Δq is the intrinsic fwhm of the peak).46 Interestingly, the Lc values of the films without PCDTBT increase from 36.16 Å to 240.18 Å with increases in the amount of DIO, indicating increased crystalline properties of the donor. In the solar cells described above, the decrease of VOC with adding more DIO in the DIO only device is probably related to these enhanced crystalline properties of the donor, which may increase intermolecular interactions and induce shifts in the e-donor's HOMO energy level. It is reported that the enhanced intermolecular interaction of donor molecules can result in increase of the HOMO level of the donors due to extended π-conjugation of the donors, resulting in reduced VOC values.47 Meanwhile, the relative proportions of crystallites with the face-on orientation in the films processed with DIO significantly decrease. The inversely proportional relationship between Lc and the proportion of crystallites with the face-on orientation is likely to affect both the JSC and FF values of the solar cells;38,48,49 the enhanced crystalline properties of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 are expected to be associated with increased aggregation of the donor phase and thus a larger degree of phase separation, which leads to reduced charge separation/generation at the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/PC71BM interface. Although the high crystallinity of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is favourable for charge carrier mobility, the increased edge-on orientation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and the poor interconnectivity between the aggregated donor phases could disrupt charge transport, and thus result in decreases in JSC and FF. In comparison, the blend films processed with PCDTBT contain higher proportions of crystallites with the face-on orientation than the pristine films and, interestingly, the ratio of face-on to edge-on orientations increases as the DIO content increases. The Lc values of the blend films only slightly increase with increases in the DIO content in the range 0.4–3 v/v%, which indicates that PCDTBT prevents over-aggregation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and thus preserves the film morphology in which the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PC71BM domains are intermixed. This result is in good agreement with the conclusion that the solar cells processed with PCDTBT consistently exhibit higher JSC and FF values and thus PCE values than the pristine films.

We measured the dark current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of a single carrier device and then estimated the hole mobilities in the blend films by using the SCLC model.50 The interpretation of the experimental results with this model revealed that the hole mobilities in the blend films without added polymer are 5.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 7.00 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 7.48 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 0.4, 1, and 3 v/v% DIO, respectively. Thus, the hole mobility decreases by one order of magnitude when 1 or 3 v/v% DIO is added despite the increased crystallinity of p-DTS-(PTTh2)2. In comparison, the blend films containing the polymer exhibit improved transport properties with mobility values of 7.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 1.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 0.4, 1, and 3 v/v% DIO, respectively, even though the crystallinity of p-DTS-(PTTh2)2 in the blend film is reduced by the addition of the polymer. These increases in mobility arise because of the increased proportion of the face-on molecular orientation and the increased number of percolating pathways formed between the donor and acceptor phases.
DIO has been shown to slow down the film solidification process and to promote the crystallization of the donor material;23,30,39 PCDTBT may act in the opposite manner to DIO. During the spin casting of the blend film, the favorable intermolecular interactions between p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and PCDTBT restrict excessive crystal growth of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and make the polymer chains exist in the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 phase and the crystallite be well dispersed. As a result, PCDTBT suppresses the over-aggregation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallites. It is possible that the PCDTBT push–pull unit of thiophene-benzothiadiazole (BT), which has a similar structure to that of thiophene-fluorobenzothiadiazole (FBT) in p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, undergoes favorable intermolecular interactions, such as dipole–dipole interactions, with p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. To test this idea, we synthesized PCDTBT derivative polymers P1 and P2 shown in Fig. 5(a), and the interactions between p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and these polymers were investigated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis (Fig. S4†). Pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 produces a relatively sharp melting peak at 208.84 °C with a melting enthalpy of 37.24 J g−1. The blends of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 with 1, 5, and 10 w% PCDTBT have very similar melting points to that of the pristine film; however, the melting enthalpies are lower: 30.53 J g−1, 30.07 J g−1, and 26.36 J g−1 for 1, 5, and 10 w% PCDTBT respectively. The melting enthalpy value can be understood as reflecting the degree of crystallinity,37i.e. the decrease in the melting enthalpy of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 component of the blends is in accordance with the reduced crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in the presence of PCDTBT. The push–pull type polymer P1, which contains thiophene-BT moieties in the polymer chain, also produces similar results: the melting enthalpies of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 blends with 1, 5, and 10 w% P1 are 30.84 J g−1, 27.28 J g−1, and 15.55 J g−1, respectively. However, in the presence of various amounts of P2, which does not contain BT pull units, the melting enthalpy values are similar: 34.63 J g−1, 32.94 J g−1, and 32.40 J g−1 with 1, 5, and 10 w% of P2, respectively, which indicates that the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is not significantly affected by P2. We also compared the properties of the p-DTS-(PTTh2)2:PC71BM blend films containing PCDTBT, P1, and P2 in solar cells with the device structure described above. Fig. 5(b) shows the J–V curves, and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Fig. 5(c). Interestingly, the solar cell device containing P1 exhibits a much better PCE, 7.92%, than that containing only DIO (6.68%); this performance is comparable to that of the device fabricated with PCDTBT. However, when P1 is replaced with P2, the efficiency is slightly reduced to 6.54%; the main contribution to this decrease is the reduction in FF from 66.04% to 59.10%, with JSC also slightly reduced from 15.18 mA cm−2 to 14.57 mA cm−2. Although a more comprehensive study of the effects of polymer structure on solar cell properties is necessary, we conclude that the polymer containing a moiety of the push–pull unit in the small molecule has significant effects on solar cell properties; these effects are most likely due to the intermolecular interactions between the polymer and the small molecules, which induce a morphology that is favorable to charge generation and transport.

2.3. Thermal stability of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM BHJ solar cells
The thermal stabilities of the best solar cell devices were tested by aging them at 110 °C under an inert atmosphere. We compared the decreases in the photovoltaic parameters of the solar cell prepared with 2 w% PCDTBT and 0.4 v/v% DIO with those of the corresponding device prepared with only 0.4% DIO. After identical curing and aging for 3 h, the thermal stabilities (Fig. 6(a)–(c)) of the performance of the solar cell devices with and without PCDTBT were found to be significantly different. The PCE of the device without PCDTBT decreased from 6.75% to 1.74% after 3 h, i.e. only 26% of its original performance. This result is typical of many systems employing PC71BM, and is primarily attributed to a decrease in FF and JSC due to the segregation of the PC71BM and small molecule donor phase. When PCDTBT is added, the device performance remains relatively stable, retaining 60% of its initial efficiency. This result suggests that the nano-scale structure of the bulk-heterojunction containing PCDTBT undergoes a different evolution to that of the device without PCDTBT during the thermal stress test. The source of this improved stability is still under investigation, but it is thought that phase segregation is frustrated under these thermal annealing conditions because the introduced PCDTBT reduces the driving force for the crystallization of p-DTS-(PTTh2)2. More importantly, in an accelerated aging test at 65 °C and 85% relative humidity (RH), the stability of the photovoltaic cells under the prolonged stress was enhanced by the introduction of 2 w% PCDTBT: after 1000 h, a relative efficiency of up to 89% of its starting value was obtained.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that the incorporation of PCDTBT into a p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM blend film has important effects on the film morphology and thus on the small molecule BHJ solar cell properties. The morphology improvements due to PCDTBT and DIO are complementary and synergistic, and arise because they induce different phase growth behaviors during deposition. DIO promotes the crystalline arrangement of the donor phase and the intermolecular interactions of the polymer with the push–pull moiety of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 simultaneously induce the dispersion of the donor crystallites to form interpenetrating pathways by suppressing donor over-segregation. As a result, solar cells prepared with both PCDTBT and DIO consistently achieve high performances, in particular FF values in the range 65.07–66.36%, regardless of the DIO content used in device preparation. In contrast, there is a large variation in the performances of the solar cells prepared with only DIO; the FF values vary in the range 33.69–60.0%. Moreover, the introduction of PCDTBT was found to produce a significant improvement in solar cell stability under heating and at 65 °C/85% RH. We conclude that the use of polymer additives is a promising approach to the fabrication of high performance small molecule BHJ solar cells with high stability.
