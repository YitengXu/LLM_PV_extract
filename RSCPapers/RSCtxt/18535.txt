    , Accepted 10th July 2017First published on 11th July 2017AbstractIn comparison to the conjugated polymers synthesized from thiophene or thiophene derivatives, furan and its derivatives are promising alternative building units due to their desirable properties such as smaller heteroatom size, more electronegative heteroatom, and larger dipole moment. Considering the advantages of furan units, conjugated polymers synthesized from furan and its derivatives show a higher degree of conjugation with reduced twisting between adjacent units, smaller π-stacking distance, and improved solubility. To date, despite research on polymers constructed from furan derivatives gaining attention, conjugated polymers made up of only furan or its derivatives are still rare. Herein, we report a new conjugated polymer, poly(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)furan-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-alt-2,5-didodecyl-3,6-di(furan-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione), P(BDF-FDPP), for organic solar cells. The smaller oxygen atom in furan of P(BDF-FDPP) results in a planar conjugated backbone with negligible torsion (dihedral angle < 0.1°) determined by density functional theory. P(BDF-FDPP) exhibits broad absorption up to 940 nm with HOMO and LUMO located at −5.19 eV and −3.63 eV, respectively. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.55% with a high fill factor (FF) of 0.73 was obtained for the devices fabricated using DPE as an additive. The substantial changes in photovoltaic performance of the device fabricated with or without additives was further investigated with grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy experiments. Preferential face-on orientation of P(BDF-FDPP) and sophisticated interpenetrated network for P(BDF-FDPP)/PC71BM blend films enabled relatively good PCEs and high FF in solar cell devices.
Introduction
In the last decade, tremendous efforts have been devoted to organic solar cells (OSCs) targeting the design of new p-type and n-type organic semiconducting materials, the optimization of the device fabrication, and the improvement of the device stability.1–6 Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has been significantly increased from 1% to over 10% over the last two decades.7–19 Great attention has been paid towards creating new p-type materials with an extended absorption band for efficient light harvesting. Polymers featuring phenyl and vinyl groups in the backbone such as polyphenylenevinylene, polyphenyl, and polyacetylene were widely investigated in the 1990s before polythiophene and its derivatives were systematically studied.4,20,21 Polythiophene and its derivatives exhibit superior optical, electronic and physical properties, hence they have been utilized in various fields including OSCs, organic thin film transistors (OTFTs), and sensors.22–25 Inspired by polythiophene, different electron-donating and electron-accepting units have been synthesized from various thiophene derivatives. For instance, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT), cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene, and indacenodithiophene are frequently used as electron-donating moieties, while 3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene, and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione are widely employed as electron-accepting moieties.1,5,26–29
Heterocyclic aromatic 5-membered rings containing oxygen, sulfur, selenium, and tellurium have been exploited as building units for the synthesis of semiconducting polymers.30 However, the research on furan, selenophene, and tellurophene lags behind thiophene, which is predominantly used to synthesize semiconducting polymers for OSCs.30 In the past few years, investigation of other heterocyclic rings for OSCs and OTFTs is gaining more attention, especially furan and selenophene. By changing the heteroatoms in the ring could substantially affect the intrinsic properties of the resulting semiconducting polymers. Furan has some desirable properties, such as smaller heteroatom size, large dipole moment, and a more electronegative heteroatom.30 The smaller oxygen atom, as well as larger dipole moment of furan could reduce the π-stacking distance between the polymer backbones and also enhance the solubility of the corresponding polymers.26,30,31 Moreover, furan and its derivatives could be regarded as sustainable building units since furfural can be prepared from biomass.32 Furfural can be isolated from agricultural by-products such as corncobs, oat and sawdust.33 With the rapid development of synthetic methods, furan derivatives can be prepared easily from furfural. For instance, furan-2-carbonitrile could be synthesized from furfural in the presence of Fe3O4 with a yield of 87%, and furan-2-carbonitrile is one of the starting materials to synthesize 3,6-di(furan-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (FDPP).34–36 Since the discovery of FDPP, it has been widely investigated as building unit in polymers for OSCs and OTFTs, and has been shown to have good performance.35–43 For the polymers based on furan, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (BDF), the analogue to BDT, is another widespread building moiety in addition to FDPP and furan itself.44–46 Similar to BDT, BDF is a symmetric and planar electron donating unit with 4 and 8 positions available for modification through attaching different substituents.26,47,48 Recently, a PCE as high as 9.43% have been achieved for the polymer built from BDF, with a thiophene derivative used as the electron accepting moiety.49 Even though research on semiconducting polymers constructed from furan derivatives has been increasing in recent years, polymers made up of only furan or furan derivatives are still rare. Fréchet and co-workers synthesized a polymer from furan and FDPP units and a PCE of 4.1% was achieved when [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was used as the acceptor.35 Jeffries-EL et al. also studied polymers containing BDF and FDPP units with decyl substituted thiophene as π-bridge.50 It's noteworthy that FDPP polymers showed a broader absorption compared to the thiophene based polymers and a PCE of 2.89% was obtained for BDF-FDPP donor–acceptor copolymers.50
In this contribution, a new donor–acceptor polymer made of furan derivatives, FDPP and BDF, was synthesized by Stille-coupling polymerization in good yield (Fig. 1). This new polymer showed a broad absorption range up to 940 nm with narrow optical bandgap of 1.36 eV. P(BDF-FDPP) was utilized as a p-type material in OSCs with PC71BM as the n-type material. Significant improvement was observed when additives were applied in the bulk solution and a PCE of 5.55% with a high fill factor (FF) of 0.73 was attained using conventional device architecture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE reported for the copolymers synthesized using furan derivatives as both electron-donating and electron-accepting moieties. Preferential face-on orientation of the P(BDF-FDPP) conjugated backbone was revealed by grazing incident wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) exhibits significant morphology changes for the P(BDF-FDPP) and PC71BM blend films prepared with and without additives.

Experimental
Materials
All the chemicals used for synthesis were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Fisher Scientific without further purification unless elsewhere mentioned. PC71BM was purchased from Nano-C. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were freshly distilled over benzophenone/sodium ketyl. Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-4,8-dione44,45,51 and 3,6-di(furan-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione50 were synthesized according to the reported literature.
Polymerization for BDF-FDPP
(4,8-Bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)furan-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (M1) (120 mg, 0.143 mmol) and 3,6-bis(5-bromofuran-2-yl)-2,5-didodecylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione (M2) (108 mg, 0.143 mmol) were dissolved in 4 mL toluene in a pressure tube. Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (2.60 mg, 0.00286 mmol) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (3.48 mg, 0.014 mmol) were added to the solution. All of the reaction mixture preparation was carried out inside a glovebox under a nitrogen atmosphere. After preparation, the pressure tube was taken from the glovebox and heated to 115 °C for 20 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into methanol and the precipitated solid was filtered into an extraction thimble. The solid was purified by Soxhlet extractions using methanol, diethyl ether, and hexane sequentially. The polymer was then dissolved in chloroform, concentrated and precipitated in methanol. The collected dark purple solid was dried in a vacuum oven for 6 hours. (Yield: 115 mg, 72%) Mn = 29.5 kDa; polydispersity = 2.65.
Characterization

1H and 13C spectra were measured on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer. Thermal stability was studied on a Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC-1 system under nitrogen flow with 10 °C per minute heating and cooling rate. The molecular weight of the polymer was measured by SEC on a Viscotec VE 3580 system equipped with CLM3009 columns, connected to a UV detector using 254 nm lasers. The chloroform was used as eluent and the calibration was carried out using polystyrene standards. UV-vis absorption was recorded by Agilent 8453 UV-vis spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements was carried out on BAS CV-50W voltammetric analyzer with platinum disk, platinum wire and Ag/Ag+ used as working electrode, auxiliary electrode, and reference electrode, respectively. 0.1 M of electrochemical grade tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in acetonitrile was chosen as the electrolytic solution. CV was calibrated by ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) which was used as an internal reference, and the E1/2 of the redox couple was found at 0.09 V vs. Ag/Ag+. GIWAXS experiments were carried out at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) D1 (λ = 1.168 Å) station. An intense beam of 10.1 keV photons was supplied by a wide bandpass (1.47%) doublebounce multilayer monochromator. The intensities for GIWAXS were recorded using a fast 2D detector (PILATUS 200 K from Dectris) with 172 μm per pixel resolution and 84 mm by 75 mm total area. The distance between the thin film sample and the detector was 16.5 cm. The sample was fixed on a sample goniometer to control the incident angle (Table S4†) and sample azimuth. An accurate calibration for the incident angle was executed in situ through measuring the reflectivity of the X-ray from the sample with an ion chamber. A ceria standard was used to calibrate the measurements. Intense scattering near the direct beam was blocked using a 1.5 mm-wide tantalum rod. Under these conditions, exposure times ranged from 3 to 5 seconds depending on sample quality and the contrast. Theoretical calculation was conducted at B3LYP/6-31G* level using Spartan 06. The as-prepared films were imaged with a Bruker Dimension V hybrid AFM in tapping mode. TEM images were acquired on instrument model FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit Biotwin with accelerating voltage of 120 kV.
Device fabrication
Conventional device configuration of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate))/active layer/Ca/Al was chosen for photovoltaic performance investigation. ITO-coated glass substrate (10 Ω cm−2) was purchased from Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd. and cleaned stepwise in deionized water, acetone, toluene and isopropyl alcohol for 15 minutes each. A thin layer (∼20 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios PVP AI 4083) was spin-coated on top of UV/ozone treated ITO glass at 3000 rpm for 60 seconds. The substrate was then annealed at 150 °C for 10 minutes after transferring into the glovebox. Total concentration of 20 mg mL−1 polymer and PC71BM in chlorobenzene (CB) with different percentage of additives was spin-coated on PEDOT:PSS at 1000 rpm without further treatments. The substrates were then mounted on a shadow mask in a thermal evaporator. Layers of Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) were then deposited in sequence under vacuum (3 × 10−6 Torr), with the effective area of 0.084 cm2. The average data with standard deviation provided were calculated from at least 4 devices. Keithley 2400 source meter interfaced with Labview software was used to record current density–voltage (J–V) for photovoltaic devices. The measurements were conducted under simulated AM 1.5G (250 W xenon lamp), which was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by NREL certified Hamamatsu silicon photodiode. External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) measurement was carried out using instrument QEX10. The intensity of the incident light was calibrated by NREL certified Hamamatsu silicon photodiode from 300 nm to 1100 nm. AMBIOS XP1 Stylus Profiler was employed to measure the thickness of the active layer.
Mobility measurements
Hole and electron mobility were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. For the hole mobility measurement, diode configuration of ITO/MoOx/active layer/MoOx/Ag was applied, while ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al configuration was utilized for electron mobility measurement. The active layer was prepared under the same condition as for photovoltaic device fabrication. ZnO layer was prepared according to the published literature.52 The measurement on the completed devices was conducted by applying voltage while current density was recorded using Keithley 2400 source meter. The mobility was calculated by fitting the results to Mott–Gurney law, which is described by: J = 9εoεrμhV2/8L3, where J is current density, εo is vacuum permittivity (εo = 8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), εr is relative permittivity of semiconducting materials (assumed to be 3.5), μh is hole mobility, L is the thickness and V is applied voltage.
Results and discussion
Polymer design and synthesis
BDF and FDPP were chosen as electron-donating and electron-accepting moieties for constructing an alternating donor–acceptor copolymer. Alkylthienyl substituted two-dimensional (2D) conjugated BDT units have shown promising photovoltaic performance compared to alkoxyl substituted ones with relatively broader absorption and higher hole mobility.53,54 In consideration of the 2D conjugation effect, the alkylfuryl substituent was attached to the 4- and 8- positions of the BDF unit to extend the conjugation of the electron-donating moiety. In our recent research and according to theoretical calculations, the torsional angle between the furyl substituent and BDF is about 0.10°, which could be ascribed to the smaller size of the oxygen atom when compared to sulfur.31 Hence, better electron delocalization between the furyl substituent and the central BDF unit, and smaller π-stacking distance in the polymer could be anticipated considering less twisting between BDF and furyl substituents. Placing branched alkyl chains on electron-accepting moieties may cause steric hindrance for packing of fullerene derivatives relative to the corresponding polymers, thus reducing the photovoltaic performance.55,56 Therefore, different alkyl chains were considered with linear dodecyl chains chosen for FDPP and branched 2-ethylhexyl chains were selected for BDF.
Monomers were synthesized according to the reactions shown in Scheme 1 and the detailed procedure for each step is described in the ESI.† Stille-coupling polymerization was conducted in a pressure tube with monomers, catalyst and solvent loaded inside a glovebox under nitrogen atmosphere. The pressure tube was tightened and sealed before removing it from the glovebox. After heating in an oil bath for 20 hours, the pressure tube was cooled to room temperature and the polymer was purified subject to the procedure shown before. The resultant polymer was shown to have good solubility in common solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform and CB. SEC analysis shows that P(BDF-FDPP) has molecular weight about 29.5 kDa with polydispersity index (PDI) of ∼2.65. The thermal stability of the polymer was determined by TGA with 5% weight loss detected at 403 °C as shown in Fig. 2. In DSC measurement, a melting peak at 172 °C and a crystallization peak at 140 °C were noticed in the heating and cooling stage, respectively. The results reveal that P(BDF-FDPP) has a strong tendency to crystallize in the solid state, which is essential for efficient charge carrier transport.

Structure investigation
The structure of BDF-FDPP dimer was modeled by density functional theory (DFT) calculations using Spartan 06 at level of B3LYP/6-31G*. All alkyl groups were replaced by methyl groups to simplify the calculation. As displayed in Fig. 3, BDF-FDPP dimer retains a planar backbone with negligible twisting between each unit. The dihedral angle between BDF and furan unit from FDPP is about 0.05°, while the twisting angle between furan and DPP is about 0.08°. The origin of the high planarity of polymer backbone could be illustrated by the smaller oxygen atom in the furan unit. Perepichka et al. recently reported and compared the single crystal structures of furyl and thienyl DPP.57 Their results showed highly planar structure of furyl DPP, which agrees well with our DFT calculation.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of P(BDF-FDPP) are shown in Fig. 4 and characteristics are summarized in Table 1. In CB solution (0.01 mg mL−1), the absorption of P(BDF-FDPP) ranges from 500 nm to 900 nm with maximum absorption observed at 740 nm. Besides the maximum absorption peak, there are two shoulder peaks at 664 and 793 nm. The shoulder peak at 664 nm can be explained by intramolecular charge transfer, while the other one at 793 nm is due to the intermolecular aggregation.58 In the solid-state film, the absorption of P(BDF-FDPP) are comparable to that in CB with the same maximum absorption, although the film shows a broader absorption tail ending at 940 nm. The similar absorption for P(BDF-FDPP) in both solution and solid state film can be explained by its rigid rod conformation.

The optical bandgap calculated from the absorption edge from solid state film is 1.36 eV. The attenuation coefficient estimated from the maximum absorption in film is about 4.87 × 10−4 cm−1.
CV was performed to analyse the Frontier molecular orbital energies. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated from the onset of reduction and oxidation curves following the equation: ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.8 − E1/2,Fc/Fc+) eV; EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.8 − E1/2,Fc/Fc+) eV. As shown in Fig. 5, the HOMO was calculated to be −5.19 eV for P(BDF-FDPP), and the LUMO was at −3.63 eV. Comparing to a series of DPP polymers investigated by Yang et al., P(BDF-FDPP) has elevated HOMO energy level, while LUMO energy level is similar.42 The electrochemical bandgap calculated from the measured HOMO and LUMO energy level is estimated to be 1.56 eV. The smaller bandgap of P(BDF-FDPP), resulted from a relatively higher HOMO level, could be interpreted by its planar backbone with reduced steric hindrance.59

Photovoltaic properties and mobility
The photovoltaic properties of P(BDF-FDPP) was investigated in the conventional device architecture: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P(BDF-FDPP):PC71BM/Ca/Al and the characteristics are summarized and shown in Table 2 and Fig. 6. The bulk heterojunction layer composed of P(BDF-FDPP) and PC71BM was spin coated from 20 mg mL−1 CB solution. Initially, no additives were used and a fairly low PCE was achieved, which is mainly due to the low short circuit current (Jsc) as presented in Table 2. The addition of a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) has been demonstrated to improve the photovoltaic performance by increasing the Jsc.42,60,61 To optimize the ratio of P(BDF-FDPP) to PC71BM used, the ratios were adjusted from 1:1 to 1:3 with 3% DIO added (Fig. S3 and Table S2†) and the best condition was found at ratios of 1:2. Different volume percentages of DIO as additive in CB was investigated by fixing the P(BDF-FDPP) to PC71BM ratio at 1:2 while varying the amount of DIO. Significant growth in Jsc was observed even with 1% (v/v) DIO applied. The highest PCE of 4.34% was achieved when 3% DIO was employed in the bulk solution with a Jsc of 9.10 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.67 V and high FF of 0.72. The great change in the Jsc is probably due to the distinct morphology transition. Diphenyl ether (DPE) has recently emerged as an alternative additive in bulk heterojunction layer processing and results in a remarkable Jsc and PCE.62–64 In order to further improve the photovoltaic performance of P(BDF-FDPP), various percentages of DPE was explored. Increasing Jsc and FF were first noticed by varying volume percentage from 1% to 4%. A higher amount of DPE caused the Jsc and FF to decrease. The best PCE of 5.55% with Jsc of 11.52 mA cm−2 and high FF of 0.73 was accomplished when 4% DPE was utilized. The significant enhancement of photovoltaic performance could be ascribed to the optimized morphology.

J–V curves of photovoltaic devices fabricated from P(BDF-FDPP) with different additives used. 

Fig. 7 reveals the photo-response of the photovoltaic devices fabricated in different situations. All the devices show a broad EQE from 300 nm up to 940 nm, which is in accordance to the UV-vis described earlier. Without any additives, devices showed low EQE values less than 10%. In respect to the devices fabricated with 3% DIO, the EQE are greatly improved with the highest conversion about 50% at around 500 nm. As shown in Fig. 7, devices containing 4% DPE exhibits the highest EQE of the series with a peak located around 500 nm indicating that PC71BM had more photons converted compared to P(BDF-FDPP) in the bulk heterojunction layers. The calculated Jsc from the spectra are shown in brackets and matches well with the value acquired from J–V curves.

The charge transport properties of P(BDF-FDPP) or P(BDF-FDPP):PC71BM blend films were investigated from Schottky diode in SCLC mode (ESI Fig. S5 and S6†). Device structure of ITO/MoOx/active layer/MoOx/Al was employed for the hole mobility measurements. As summarized in Table 3, hole mobility of the pure P(BDF-FDPP) film is 2.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. A significant drop in the hole mobility for the blend films without any additives was noticed, and the hole mobility was calculated to be 7.30 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Both DIO and DPE improved the hole mobility of the blend films with values of 1.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.31 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The electron mobility was determined from the device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al. P(BDF-FDPP) film was prepared and did not show n-type properties as no curve was successfully measured from the devices. Electron mobility of 3.60 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was determined for the blend films without additive. For the additive of DIO, the electron mobility was improved to 4.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Further increase of the electron mobility to 5.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 was detected for the devices with DPE used. The increase of both hole and electron mobilities with additives could explain the higher Jsc and FF in the photovoltaic devices.

Morphology investigation
Thin and ultra-thin films of the homopolymer P(BDF-FDPP) were prepared by drop casting from solutions in CB onto silicon wafers with native oxide surface. Two types of films were studied; (i) Films with the thickness comparable to a typical thickness of active layer in solar cells (∼100 nm) which were prepared by casting from 1 mg mL−1 solutions and (ii) ultra-thin films (below ∼10 nm). Tapping mode AFM (height and phase) images of thick films (i) presented in Fig. 8a, showed ∼20 nm wide features with an ill-defined “stringy” appearance (with “strings” running diagonally from the bottom left to top right of the image). Images of ultra-thin films (ii) shown in Fig. 8b, revealed the presence of sparsely distributed, apparently branched nanofibrillar aggregates with the average height and width of, respectively, ∼1.3 × 23 nm. Survey images of ultra-thin films (ii) revealed also the presence of continuous film patches with the surface appearance similar to one observed in thick films. Images taken near the edges of those patches, Fig. S7,† showed how they gradually transitioned into sparse aggregates, pointing to the connection between those two types of features.

Formation of nanofibrillar structures driven by π-stacking of polymer chains is common to a wide range of conjugated polymers with heteroaromatic repeat units.32,65–70 It is well exemplified by the fibrillar structures evident in the AFM images of a “benchmark” regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT) presented in Fig. 8c and d. In contrast with P(BDF-FDPP), the fibrils of rr-P3HT are very clearly discernable in thick films (Fig. 8c) and can reach micron lengths (Fig. 8d). The molecular arrangement of polymer chains within the fibrils formed by rr-P3HT and its close analogs, can be readily inferred from Grazing Incident Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) patterns of thin films cast on silicon. As shown in Fig. S8,† such patterns are highly anisotropic and comprised of two major Bragg features: (i) relatively weak in-plane reflection corresponding π-stacking distance and (ii) strong out of plane reflections of several orders which correspond to layering of π-stacks in the direction perpendicular to the surface. The inter-layer spacing inferred from the position of those out of plane peaks is dictated by the length and arrangement of alkyl side chains. This type of layering is also manifest by the presence of multiple, evenly spaced modes in the height distributions within AFM images of sparsely distributed rr-P3HT fibrils (Fig. 9b). In contrast, such evenly spaced multiple modes are not evident in the height distributions of nanofibrillar aggregates of P(BDF-FDPP) shown in Fig. 9a, with the average aggregate height ∼1.3 nm. Another distinct feature evident of sparse aggregates of P(BDF-FDPP) is their quasi-reticulated arrangement with the nodes spaced by ∼100 nm. Since the heights of those modes (B) do not appear to differ significantly from other portions of aggregates (A) and in most instances they appear as three-way junctions, they most likely represent branching points rather than aggregate crossings. This can be contrasted with interfibrillar crossings evident in the image of rr-P3HT (C – D). We propose that the branched and reticulated nature of P(BDF-FDPP) aggregates revealed by AFM imaging is indicative of less orderly π-stacking in comparison with rr-P3HT, most likely due to the relatively sparse side chain placement and “cruciform” shape of the P(BDF-FDPP) repeat unit.

The majority peak centered around 0 nm is representative of the substrate height distribution for a and b. Aggregate height distribution for P(BDF-FDPP) centered at 1.3 nm (A and B). Fibril height distribution for single fibrils of rr-P3HT centered at 1.6 nm (C) and overlapping fibrils centered at 3.2 nm (D). Close-up height images of branched fibrils of P(BDF-FDPP) (a, inset). 
Further insights into molecular packing of P(BDF-FDPP) and its blends with PC71BM were provided by the analysis of 2D GIWAXS patterns shown in Fig. 10. Two distinct features can be identified in the pattern of the neat film, Fig. 10a: (i) broad maximum at q ∼ 1.7 Å−1 corresponding to interplanar spacing of ∼3.7 Å, which can be attributed to a π-stacking signal between the conjugated backbones and (ii) narrow maximum at q ∼ 0.3 Å−1. Notably, the feature (i) originating from π-stacking peak is broad and isotropic, with the intensity concentrated near the z-axis due a higher density of orientations meeting the Bragg condition out of plane of the substrate. The low-q feature (ii) for the homopolymer is practically isotropic and the spacing that it corresponds to is almost twice as large as the height of nanofibrillar aggregates revealed by AFM imaging (∼21 Å vs. ∼13 Å). Given this, rather than originating from lamellar organization of π-stacks of the kind commonly observed in rr-P3HT analogs, it is more likely due to the periodicity of the structure along the polymer backbone.
 Fig. 10  GIWAXS 2D patterns were blank subtracted and normalized by exposure time and the invariant (Table S4†), with log scale intensities represented by the scale bar. Images account for diffuse scattering by representing the Ewald sphere as a missing wedge. The P(BDF-FDPP) neat film shown (a) blend films with PC71BM and no additive (b) or with 3% DIO (c) and 4% DPE (d). 
As shown in Fig. 10b, both main features identified for the homopolymer are also clearly evident in the 2D pattern obtained for the PC71BM blend without additive. The distinct isotropic ring with the maximum q ∼ 1.3 Å−1 can be attributed to diffraction from phase separated domains of PC71BM, commonly observed in other OSC systems with fullerene derivative acceptors. In comparison, the π-stacking feature becomes almost indiscernible in the 2D patterns obtained for the blends in the presence of the additives (Fig. 10c and d). The “wash-out” of the π-stacking feature in the presence of the additives is particularly well illustrated in the radial profiles obtained by azimuthal averaging as shown in Fig. 11. At the same time, the patterns in the presence of the additives still show the distinct isotropic ring attributed to phase separated PC71BM. The clear presence of a π-stacking feature in the scattering patterns of the blend in the absence of the additives suggests that the presence of PC71BM has little effect on intermolecular packing of the polymer. In contrast, the presence of the additives appears to markedly alter the packing of polymer chains.

Further clues to the nature of the impact of the additive on intermolecular packing were provided by the results of TEM imaging of the blends, Fig. 12. In particular, minimal impact of PC71BM on polymer packing in the absence of additives is consistent with the large scale (∼300 nm) phase separation observed in this case, Fig. 12a. In comparison, TEM images of the blends containing the additives (Fig. 12b and c) indicate that the latter act as “nano-homogenizers”, dramatically decreasing the length-scale of phase separation. The observed disappearance of π-stacking feature in corresponding GIWAXS patterns may be thus attributed to the concomitant alternation of inter-chain packing. The serious aggregation of PC71BM in the blend film without additive treatment hinders efficient exciton separation at n-type and p-type material interfaces.71 The aggregation was successfully broken down by introducing additives. As represented in Fig. 12b, interpenetrated network exists in the blend films when DIO is used. The substantial change in the morphology accounts for the significant improvement of Jsc. Compared to the film treated with DIO, films processed with DPE exhibit even more sophisticated networks and less domain separation. The trend of decreasing domain size for the films fabricated under different conditions correlates well with the increasing Jsc value obtained in photovoltaic devices.

Conclusions
A novel polymer P(BDF-FDPP) built from the sustainable electron-donating and electron-accepting units, BDF and FDPP, were synthesized and characterized. The furan unit, containing a smaller oxygen atom, led to a high planar conjugated backbone of P(BDF-FDPP), and this is supported by computational modelling. P(BDF-FDPP) exhibits broad absorption and narrow bandgap with HOMO and LUMO energy levels located at −5.19 eV and −3.63 eV, respectively, measured from CV experiments. In OSCs, the photovoltaic performance is greatly influenced by the additives and the highest PCE of 5.55% was achieved when DPE was utilized as an additive. It's noteworthy that a high FF of 0.73 was obtained in photovoltaic devices. The nanoscale morphology was investigated by AFM, GIWAXS and TEM, which reveals favored face-on orientation of P(BDF-FDPP) and proper phase separation assisted by additives. Considering the results shown above, conjugated polymers built from green furan units deserve more attention and have potential to achieve even better performance in OSCs by incorporation of other furan units.

 	Fig. 9  Line profiles of tapping mode AFM height images for ultra-thin films cast of P(BDF-FDPP) (a, left) and rr-P3HT (b, left) with the normalized height distribution of P(BDF-FDPP) (a, right) and rr-P3HT (b, right). The majority peak centered around 0 nm is representative of the substrate height distribution for a and b. Aggregate height distribution for P(BDF-FDPP) centered at 1.3 nm (A and B). Fibril height distribution for single fibrils of rr-P3HT centered at 1.6 nm (C) and overlapping fibrils centered at 3.2 nm (D). Close-up height images of branched fibrils of P(BDF-FDPP) (a, inset).	 

 	Fig. 10  GIWAXS 2D patterns were blank subtracted and normalized by exposure time and the invariant (Table S4†), with log scale intensities represented by the scale bar. Images account for diffuse scattering by representing the Ewald sphere as a missing wedge. The P(BDF-FDPP) neat film shown (a) blend films with PC71BM and no additive (b) or with 3% DIO (c) and 4% DPE (d).	 

 	Fig. 11  Overlay of the azimuthally averaged radial profiles (ϕ = 80 − 90°) for homopolymer P(BDF-FDPP) and blended films in the high-q regime.	 

 	Fig. 12  TEM images of the P(BDF-FDPP) and PC71BM blend films (a) without additive, (b) with 3% DIO used, (c) with 4% DPE used (scale bar is 200 nm).
