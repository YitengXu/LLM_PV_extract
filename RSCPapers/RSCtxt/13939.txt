    , Accepted 26th March 2014First published on 1st April 2014AbstractVertically oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) were conformally coated with an ultrathin nitrogen-doped (N-doped) carbon film via the carbonization of a polyimide film deposited by molecular layer deposition and simultaneously hydrogenated, thereby creating a core/shell nanostructure with a precisely controllable shell thickness. The core/shell nanostructure provides a larger heterojunction interface to substantially reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and hydrogenation enhances solar absorption of TNTAs. In addition, the N-doped carbon film coating acts as a high catalytic active surface for oxygen evolution reaction, as well as a protective film to prevent hydrogen-treated TiO2 nanotube oxidation by electrolyte or air. As a result, the N-doped carbon film coated TNTAs displayed remarkably improved photocurrent and photostability. The TNTAs with a N-doped carbon film of ∼1 nm produces a current density of 3.6 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), which represents one of the highest values achieved with modified TNTAs. Therefore, we propose that ultrathin N-doped carbon film coating on materials is a viable approach to enhance their PEC water splitting performance.
Solar radiation is a renewable energy source that has the capacity to meet the global energy demands in a carbon-neutral fashion. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, first reported by Fujishima and Honda,1 is widely considered as a most promising and appealing approach for large-scale production of hydrogen to supply clean energy using solar energy.2,3 The PEC cells are typically designed with metal oxide semiconductors as the photoelectrode and noble metals as the auxiliary electrode. Currently, n-type vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) fabricated by electrochemical anodization remain a competitive candidate for the state-of-the-art photoanodes due to their high level of controllable aspect ratio, high surface area for sufficient contact with the electrolyte, and high light adsorption efficiency enhanced by light scattering.4 Despite such promising attributes, the overall water splitting efficiency of TNTA photoanodes falls short of the theoretical maximum efficiency in solar radiation, which is mainly ascribed to the poor spectral response in visible light for their wide band gap, low electron mobility (1 cm2 v−1 s−1),5 and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics.6 To date, modification of TNTAs with semiconductor nanoparticles with a narrow-band-gap such as CdS (ref. 7) or metal nanoparticles with good localized surface plasmon resonance performance such as Au (ref. 8) is often applied to sensitize TNTAs. Unfortunately, these semiconductors are not stable during the reaction attributed to their inevitable anodic decomposition/corrosion, and the difficulty to achieve control over the nanoparticles such as their particle size and distribution on the walls of NTs and the possibility of nanoparticle aggregation restrict their efficient use. Another active approach is doping TNTAs with appropriate anions or cations to render this material sensitive to visible light.9 The optical absorption of TiO2 can be effectively modified due to the electronic transitions from the dopant 2p or 3p orbitals to the Ti 3d orbital via suitable dopants. However, doping will also strengthen the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and deteriorate the photoelectric conversion efficiency of photoelectrodes.10 Thereby, developing a suitable strategy to further enhance PEC water splitting performance for TNTAs is highly desirable.
The surface properties of nanomaterials are particularly important to the overall reaction efficiency because they have influence on the recombination velocity and kinetics of electrode reactions. Therefore, coating TNTAs with advanced thin films naturally comes as a rational strategy to ameliorate the surface characteristic of TNTAs. In addition, the thickness of the coating film also should be optimal to reduce negative interference with the light absorption of TiO2 and the number of recombination sites in the coating. Ultrathin carbon film coating inspires the idea due to its good light response and conductivity, and high stability and strength.11 Especially, nitrogen-doped (N-doped) carbon nanomaterials have been reported as one of the best electrocatalysts for OER,12 which will greatly enhance the OER kinetics at the surface of the TNTA photoanode. However, plugging of the nanotubes and inhomogeneity of the coated surface often occur in traditional methods for carbon deposition, since these processes are not self-limiting.13,14 Molecular layer deposition (MLD) is an advanced deposition method which allows growth of polymer films with molecular-level precision in a layer-by-layer manner. As a subset of atomic layer deposition, layer-by-layer deposition allows for highly conformal coating even on complex nanostructures.15 Recently, George's group16 and our group17 reported hybrid polymer films fabricated by different MLD methods. And Putkonen et al. prepared different polyimide thin films by changing MLD parameters.18 We also found that the obtained polymer film may be converted to a carbon film via an appropriate carbonization process.19 Since the combination of the polymer film can be effectively adjusted by the parameters of MLD, various functional carbon films in demand would be achieved. It appears that coating N-doped carbon films on TNTAs via MLD will turn into a promising strategy to substantially improve the PEC water splitting performance.
Herein, we show coating the interior and exterior walls of TNTAs with an ultrathin N-doped carbon film, creating a core/shell nanostructure, by combining MLD and carbonization. Core/shell nanostructures are both of scientific and technological interest due to their enhanced properties compared to the single components in PEC water splitting.20 Plugging of the nanotubes and inhomogeneity of the modified surface are avoided, and the thickness is precisely controlled by the number of MLD cycles. In addition, TNTAs were simultaneously hydrogenated in the carbonization process, which will render this oxide sensitive to visible light.21,22 The TNTAs coated with an ultrathin N-doped carbon film serve as an extraordinarily efficient and stable photoanode for PEC water splitting. This ultrathin N-doped carbon film coating is not specific for TNTAs and may be adapted to other porous photoanodes to enhance the PEC water splitting performance.
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 presents the design and preparation process of the hydrogen-treated TNTA photoanode coated with an ultrathin carbon film. Briefly, Ti foil (Scheme 1A) was electrochemically anodized and annealed in air to form TNTAs (Scheme 1B). It is imperative to maintain the structure of TNTAs during the deposition of the carbon film for larger surface area and high light absorption. By employing MLD (Scheme 1C), core/shell nanoarray TNTAs with an ultrathin polyimide film were achieved. Subsequently, carbonization of core/shell TNTAs in a H2/Ar atmosphere (Scheme 1D) was carried out to produce an ultrathin N-doped carbon film along with the simultaneous conversion of pristine TiO2 to hydrogenated TiO2, which protects and guarantees the regularity of the original morphology of TNTAs. It should be pointed out that the surface of Ti3+ in hydrogenated TiO2 without the carbon film coating would be unstable in the electrolyte since it is easily oxidized by dissolved oxygen in water.23 The surface of TNTAs coated with an ultrathin carbon film absorbs incident light (hv) and produces electron–hole pairs. The holes migrate to the electrode–electrolyte interface and participate in the OER. The electrons transferred to the substrate travel to the counter electrode (Pt electrode) and participate in the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Photons (hv) are absorbed by the sensitized film, producing electron–hole (e–h) pairs. The holes travel only short distances to reach the electrolyte. The electrons are conducted through the core material to the conducting substrate. 
As shown in Fig. 1, the carbon film coated TNTAs display a similar morphology with ordered port NT structures of the pristine TNTAs, suggesting a stable morphological structure in the coating process. The pristine TiO2 NTs (showing a light green color) have an average wall thickness of 10 nm (Fig. 1A) and length up to around 0.5 μm (Fig. 1B). Using the MLD method, the carbon film fully covers the surface of TiO2 NTs (showing a black color). Moreover, the smooth surface without obvious pores or cracks, is expected to prevent the electrolyte or air from contacting the surface of hydrogenated TiO2 and improve the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs due to the existence of the heterojunction interface.24 After coating the carbon film, the average wall thickness of TiO2 NTs increases to 16.0 nm (Fig. 1C), and the thickness of the carbon film with 30 MLD cycles is 3.0 nm. The length of modified TiO2 NTs shows less difference during the preparation process, but the twist of NTs has been observed, which may stem from the influence of the applied heat treatment (Fig. 1D). This length value is shorter than the light absorption depth near the band gap (approximately 1 μm),2 and thus guarantees an efficient light absorption.

The change of the surface state of nanomaterials can be observed by mapping their initial and final states by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).25Fig. 2A shows a typical SEM image of the TNTAs coated with an ultrathin carbon film. Fig. 2B–E show EDX maps of titanium, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, respectively. These elements are uniformly distributed on the surfaces of modified TNTAs, demonstrating high homogeneity of the obtained protective film. However, no carbon and nitrogen elements are observed on the surface of pristine TNTAs (Fig. S1†). This result indicates that the uniform N-doped carbon film has conformally coated on the TiO2 NTs.

Raman spectroscopy was employed to confirm the existence of an ultrathin carbon film. The Raman peaks at 147, 394, 515 and 633 cm−1 observed in all three samples can be assigned to Eg, B1g, A1g, and Eg modes of the anatase phase, respectively, indicating that the crystallinities of present TiO2 NTs all belong to anatase TiO2 (Fig. 3A). Only in the C coating hydrogenated TiO2 (C coating/H–TiO2) sample, Raman analysis displays two additional bands centered around 1347 cm−1 and 1608 cm−1, which are characteristic D band and G band for carbon materials.26 The occurrence of G band indicates the existence of graphitized carbon in the C coating/H–TiO2. The intensity ratio I(D)/I(G), which is usually used to depict the degree of graphitization of carbon materials,27 of the carbon film (0.42), reveals that the carbon film is well graphitized. FT-IR spectroscopy was further applied to detect potential functional groups in the carbon film. As shown in Fig. 3B, only two strong peaks at 3430 (νO–H) and 631 cm−1 (νTi–O–Ti) are found in pristine TiO2 which could be attributed to the absorbed water molecules from air and antisymmetric Ti–O stretching, respectively. However, some new peaks between 2850 and 2969 cm−1 which appear in C coating/H–TiO2 can be assigned to a methylene stretch and indicate the existence of CH2 or CH groups. Furthermore, the peak at 1733 cm−1 is attributed to carbonyl and carboxylic groups (νCO), and the peak at 1633 cm−1 (δCC) stems from the skeletal vibration of sp2 carbon. CO–N bending mode between 1510 and 1365 cm−1 and C–N stretching mode at 1265 cm−1 are also observed, as shown in Fig. 3B. At low frequencies, two noticeable peaks are observed at 1170 cm−1 and 1051 cm−1, corresponding with C–O vibrations. These functional groups existing in ethylenediamine and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic anhydride will transfer to the polyimide through a condensation reaction equation (1). Although most of these groups are decomposed or removed in the carbonization process, some of them are still maintained in the obtained carbon film. To further confirm the element contents and states of C, O and N, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were carried out. As shown in Fig. S2,† the content of C, O and N is determined to be 81.49%, 13.79% and 4.72%, respectively (Fig. S2†). Moreover, only pyridine N and pyridone N at around 398.2 and 400.6 eV appear in the carbon film, which will render high electron transfer capability and electrochemical activity to carbon materials, since pyridinic nitrogen is an important active site for OER.12 (1)

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) investigations were conducted to further investigate the crystalline structure of carbon-film coated TNTAs. Fig. 4A shows that the nanostructures have uniform diameters of about 100 nm throughout their lengths. The selected-area electron diffraction patterns (SAED, inset in Fig. 4A) reveal the polycrystalline nature of these TiO2 NTs. The observed diffraction rings agree well with the lattice spacing of the anatase TiO2 crystal. A typical lattice-resolved TEM image collected from a small NT (Fig. 4B) reveals that two clear amorphous carbon films were uniformly deposited on the interior and exterior walls of NTs, respectively, identifying a core/shell nanostructure. So it is clear that the dense carbon film has conformally coated the walls of TiO2 NTs. In contrast, no carbon film was observed on the HRTEM image of pristine TiO2 (Fig. S3†). Fig. 4C shows that the interplanar spacing of 3.52 Å and 2.38 Å matches well with the (101) and (004) planes of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS 89-4921). The precise control of the thickness of the carbon film could be achieved by varying the number of MLD cycles. For example, the average carbon thicknesses determined by HRTEM are 0.92, 2.78, and 5.18 nm after 10, 30, and 50 cycles, respectively (Fig. 4C–E). The thickness of the carbon film linearly increased with MLD cycles (Fig. 4F) at a growth rate of 1.03 Å per cycle. It is worth mentioning that C coating/H–TiO2 for less than 5 cycles leads to some cracks on the carbon surface (see Fig. S4†), which will deteriorate the stability of modified TNTAs. Thus, TNTAs with 10, 30, and 50 coating cycles are chosen in this study. XRD patterns were collected to determine the crystal and possible phase changes during the preparation process. The pure anatase phase of TiO2 was found in pristine TiO2 NTs as confirmed in Fig. S5,† however, the low ratio rutile phase TiO2 emerges in H–TiO2 and C coating/H–TiO2 due to the heat treatment. Moreover, the diffraction peak at 2θ of 42.1°, which corresponds to the graphite crystal face of (100), was detectable only in the C coating/H–TiO2 sample, and it corresponded well with HRTEM characterization. Good graphitization of the carbon film will give strong electron-transfer ability to TNTAs.

(F) The thicknesses of the carbon film were plotted vs. MLD cycles, showing that the growth rate is linear. 
The optical absorption properties of the three samples were measured using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and are shown in Fig. 5A. It is clear that the band gap of the pristine TiO2 is calculated to be 3.19 eV according to the formula Eg = 1240/λ.28 The light absorption edges of hydrogenated TiO2 samples extend from the ultraviolet to visible region due to the formation of intraband transitions during hydrogenation at high temperature.21 In addition, no decreased absorption in the short wavelength region from 320 to 400 nm was found after carbon coating, indicating that the N-doped carbon film does not reduce the light absorption of TiO2 NTs. Compared to the H–TiO2, an obviously enhanced absorbance of C coating/H–TiO2 TNTAs in the visible light region was observed due to the strong absorption of carbon in this region.

Preliminary (proof-of-concept) PEC performance measurements were carried out in a home-made three electrode electrochemical cell (shown in Fig. S6†). The dependences of photocurrent density on the applied potential (J–V) plots in the dark and under AM 1.5G illumination are shown in Fig. 5B. All electrodes show negligible current values in the dark over the displayed potential range. The onset photocurrent potentials for the pristine TiO2 sample appear at ∼−0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl, which is agreement with the reported value (∼−0.84 V versus Ag/AgCl) for TiO2 electrodes in 1 M KOH electrolyte.29 After hydrogenation and carbon coating, this value shifted to around −0.9 V, which indicates a shift in the Fermi level to a more negative potential,30 demonstrating a better charge separation and electron accumulation in C coating/H–TiO2 than in H–TiO2 and pristine TiO2. All photoelectrodes display a continuously increasing photoresponse with the increasing bias potential. However, the C coating/H–TiO2 photoelectrode displays a much superior activity compared to the H–TiO2 and pristine TiO2 photoelectrodes over the whole examined bias range. The highest photocurrent density of 3.6 mA cm−2 for the C coating/H–TiO2 photoelectrode with 10 MLD cycles at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl could be achieved, which is 1.6 times larger than that of the H–TiO2 electrode and 5.4 times larger than that of pristine TiO2. Moreover, the value of 3.6 mA cm−2 is still higher than the value of other reports about TNTAs modified with other carbon materials.13,14 Basically, thinner walls benefit the charge transport in TNTAs according to Grimes's report.31 In our case, the thickness of walls in TNTAs modified with carbon film deposition for 10 MLD cycles is the thinnest, and the defects in this carbon film which are the active sites for recombination of photogenerated electrons–hole pairs is also least. In addition, when the cycle number is less than 10, there are some cracks on the carbon film. These cracks will deteriorate the electro-transfer capability of the carbon film, which strengthens the recombination of photo-generated electron–hole pairs, and reduces the PEC performance. Therefore, the TNTA photoelectrode with 10 cycles of carbon film coating exhibits the best PEC performance. In the coming part, only the TNTA photoelectrode with 10 cycles of carbon film coating was investigated in detail due to its best PEC performance.
To evaluate the performance of the photoanode, the photoresponses of three samples were investigated by chronoamperometric (photocurrent versus time) (J–t) curves measurements under pulsed illumination at a constant potential of 0.23 V versus Ag/AgCl, because it corresponds to the water oxidation potential. As shown in Fig. 5C, the photocurrent values of all electrodes decreased to nearly zero as soon as the incident light on the photoanodes was turned off and had a transient increase only when the light was turned on again. These results reveal that that all of these electrodes have fast photoresponses. However, the H–TiO2 photoanode shows a rapid decrease in the first few cycles, which could contribute to the oxidation of surface-doped Ti3+ and wall rupture in TiO2 NTs without carbon film coating in annealing (see Fig. S7†). However, after coating the TiO2 NTs with the carbon film, the oxidation of Ti3+ and structural rupture could be prevented and thus, no rapid decrease was observed (Fig. 1D and 5C). Moreover, although the C coating/H–TiO2 photoanode shows stable-state current decay, the rate is much slower than that of the pristine TiO2 photoanode. This result indicated that TiO2 NTs coated with the carbon film possess good tolerance against photocorrosion and have a potential long-term application as a photoanode in PEC water splitting.
Furthermore, incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements which were performed at a constant potential of 0.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl, were utilized to estimate the wavelength-dependent light harvesting efficiency. IPCE values can be calculated using the following equation:22 IPCE = (1240I)/(λJlight)(2)where I is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Jlight is the incident light irradiance (mW cm−2), and λ is the incident light wavelength (nm). As shown in Fig. 5D, the C coating/H–TiO2 sample exhibits significant increases in photoactivity in the wavelength range from 300 to 500 nm compared to the pristine TiO2 and H–TiO2. For example, C coating/H–TiO2 has an IPCE value of 64.5% at 330 nm, which is 1.7 times higher than that of the H–TiO2 sample and 4.8 times higher than that of the pristine TiO2 sample. Moreover, the IPCE values of C coating/H–TiO2 show t a small peak at 440 nm, which is direct evidence for a visible photoresponse. IPCE results for all the photoanodes are also consistent with their corresponding J–V characteristics. The enhanced performance might be attributed to the fact that the carbon coated films on the walls of TNTAs form a core/shell nanostructure, where the heterojunction can act as an energy barrier to suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs, and the electron transporting carbon film shell simultaneously strengthens the reactivity of the photogenerated hole for water splitting.24,32
To further understand the enhanced PEC performance, the inherent electronic properties of TNTAs were characterized by measuring the onset OER potential, linear Tafel plots and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It is well-known that the larger overpotential of TiO2 for OER, presenting the sluggish kinetics, commonly limits its wide application in PEC water splitting. The onset potential for OER of pristine TiO2, H–TiO2 and C coating/H–TiO2 is 0.583, 0.599, and 0.539 V, respectively, and thus, the overpotential of TiO2 for OER showed a general order of ΔH–TiO2 > ΔpristineTiO2 > ΔCcoating/H–TiO2. This lower overpotential of C coating/H–TiO2 suggests that electrocatalytical activity in TNTAs was greatly enhanced by the N-doped carbon coating. However, the electrocatalytical activity could be deteriorated by hydrogen treatment. As mentioned above in XPS results, pyridinic-nitrogen-or/and quaternary-nitrogen-related sites were formed in the obtained N-doping carbon film. Thus the carbon atoms adjacent to nitrogen atoms would be positively charged due to the electron-withdrawing nitrogen atoms in a graphene π-system,33 which can facilitate the absorption of OH− and support the easy recombination of two Oads additives. In addition, N-doping in carbon materials could also increase the electron transfer capability to reduce ohmic polarization.34 Therefore, the N-doped carbon film displays a low overpotential for OER, and thus remarkably enhances the OER kinetics. However, the surface of H–TiO2 becomes more hydrophobic due to hydrogen passivation of the dangling bonds of TiO,20 which results in a decrease in the interactions of the absorbed species (such as OH−, H2O, and Oads) on the surface of H–TiO2. Thus a high overpotential for OER in H–TiO2 was observed.
Basically, the Tafel plot describes the relationship between the overpotential (η) and the logarithm of the current (ik), which is an important parameter for water oxidation electrocatalysts and can provide important information about electronic and geometric enhancement in the activity of electrocatalysts.35 In general, a decrease in the slope of the curve is representative of a beneficial electronic effect. Similarly, an increase in the exchange current (or the intercept of the line with the potential axis) is the result of a beneficial geometric effect or an enhanced surface area. As shown in Fig. 6, the slope of the Tafel curve for pristine TiO2, H–TiO2 and C coating/H–TiO2 is 82, 104, and 67 mV per decade, respectively. In addition, the exchange current showed a general order of IoCcoating/H–TiO2 > IoH–TiO2 > IopristineTiO2. Obviously, the C coating/H–TiO2 sample exhibits the lowest slop value and the biggest exchange current value. These results demonstrate that the electronic and geometric effects on the surface of TNTAs could be simultaneously ameliorated via the ultrathin carbon coating.

Fig. 6C presents Nyquist plots measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under illumination (Nyquist plots in the dark shown in Fig. S8†). All of the photoelectrodes show two semicircles. However, the semicircle at a low-frequency is greatly reduced in the C coating/H–TiO2 based photoelectrode. Usually, the semicircle at the high-frequency zone presents the diffusion of ions into NTs, which is a typical EIS characteristic of the embedded electrode, and the low-frequency semicircle which is equal to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) is the characteristic of the charge transfer process.36 The C coating/H–TiO2 showed a lower Rct value than that of H–TiO2 and pristine TiO2 both in the dark and under illumination. This result suggests that the N-doped carbon film could accelerate charge transfer kinetics and act as a high effective water oxidation electrocatalyst. This is beneficial for the PEC water splitting performance of the TNTA photoanode.
Moreover, the capability of charge separation via carbon coating can be verified by the photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.37 As shown in Fig. 6D, a broad-band emission around 410 nm wavelength (excited at 325 nm) appears which can be attributed to the recombination of photoexcited holes with electrons occupying the singly ionized oxygen vacancies in TiO2.38 A high PL intensity presents a high level of the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Compared to that of H–TiO2/pristine TiO2, the PL intensity of C coating/H–TiO2 decreases significantly, indicating superior performance for impeding photogenerated charge recombination, which could be attributed to the carbon coating passivating the surface of TiO2 and the carbon film facilitating the electron transfer from the electrolyte to the TNTA photoanode in the C coating/H–TiO2 sample.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a uniform ultrathin N-doped carbon film coating on the interior and exterior walls of hydrogen-treated TNTAs was achieved through a MLD strategy. The formed core/shell nanostructures not only enhance the stability of hydrogen-treated TNTAs via carbon coating, but also improve the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs due to the existence of a heterojunction interface. Simultaneously, hydrogenation extends the absorption spectrum from UV to visible light. Moreover, the highly active N-doped carbon film greatly improves the kinetics of PEC water splitting, and leads to the applied potential required for driving photo-assisted water splitting to shift cathodically by 100 mV. Therefore, a 5-fold increase in the photocurrent and enhanced photostability of C coating/H–TiO2 under AM 1.5G light illumination as compared to pristine TiO2, were obtained. This combination of enhanced photocatalytic activity and photostability makes the ultrathin N-doped carbon film coating a promising strategy in the fields of PEC water splitting for TNTAs or other porous semiconductors.
Methods
Preparation of TNTAs
Highly ordered TNTAs were fabricated through anodic oxidation of Ti substrates. Before the anodization, the Ti substrate was chemically etched by immersing it in a mixture of 40% HF, HNO3 and deionized water (HF:HNO3:H2O = 1:4:5 in volume). Then the Ti foil was ultrasonically washed with acetone and ethanol for 5 min each. The cleaned Ti foil was anodized in a 0.5% HF electrolyte in a two-electrode cell with the Ti foil as the working and a plate sheet as the counter electrode in an ice bath with the assistance of magnetic stirring. Potentiostatic anodic oxidation was performed under 25 V for 40 min. After sonication for 5 min, the sample was put in a muffle furnace under an oxygen atmosphere with a flow rate of 60 sccm, then heated to 500 °C with a rate of 3 °C min−1 and maintained at the temperature for 2 hours. Then it was cooled to room temperature with a rate of 3 °C min−1. Finally a plate of pristine TNTAs was obtained.
Coating TNTAs with ultrathin carbon films by MLD
The MLD of polyimide on TNTAs was carried out in a home-made, closed type, hot wall ALD reactor. The pristine TNTA plate was transferred to the ALD chamber for the growth of the carbon ultrathin film. The deposition was carried out with ethylenediamine (EDA) and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic anhydride (PMDA) as precursors using N2 as a carrying gas. The deposition temperature was 165 °C while EDA and PMDA were kept at room temperature and 150 °C, respectively. The obtained TNTA plate modified with the polyimide film was then transferred into a quartz tube furnace and annealed at 600 °C for 1 h in a H2/Ar gas flow to produce ultrathin carbon films.
Characterization of catalysts
Raman spectra of the samples were recorded on a Horiba Labram HR800 spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 633 nm. FTIR spectroscopy was carried out with a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer. The chemical composition and bonding configurations were evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) performed on a Kratos XSAM 800 spectrometer using an Al Kα (hk = 1486.6 eV) X-ray source. The crystalline structures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-rA, Japan) using a diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54184 Å in the range of 2θ = 15–75° at a scan rate of 4° min−1. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) on a Hitachi S-4800 microscope was performed to observe the morphologies of ultrathin carbon modified TNTAs. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by using a JEOL-2100F microscope. A U-3900 spectrophotometer was employed for recording the UV-vis absorption spectra of ultrathin carbon modified TNTAs. Photoluminescence measurement was carried out on a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer.
Photoelectrochemical measurement
The electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of each sample were tested using a three electrode electrochemical cell with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode (3 mol L−1 KCl filled) and a Pt plate (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) counter electrode with a CHI760D electrochemical workstation. The working electrode (the photoanode consisting of the ultrathin carbon film modified TNTAs) with an illuminated area of 1.50 cm2 was immersed in 1 M KOH and illuminated using a 300 W xenon lamp with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (PLS-SXE300, PE300BF) coupled with an AM 1.5G filter was used as the solar light. Linear sweep voltammetry was performed with a voltage scan speed of 5 mV s−1, and the light was chopped manually at regular intervals at a fixed potential of 0.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Electrochemical impedance spectra were measured by applying a bias of 0.23 vs. Ag/AgCl over the frequency range of 10−1 to 105 Hz with a 5 mV amplitude under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. A monochromator (Oriel) was also employed to study the spectral response and was used in conjunction with a power meter and a photodiode (Newport) to calculate IPCE. The IPCE was measured as a function of wavelength from 300 to 500 nm with a three-electrode configuration at 0.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
