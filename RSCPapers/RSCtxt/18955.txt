This work addresses the significance of the intensity, rather than just the traditionally emphasized broadness, of the absorption band in developing DSSC sensitizers. With the assistance of calculating the oscillator strength of the first transition, the indoline-conjugated porphyrin sensitizer CM-b is screened out to have an impressively large Qx molar absorptivity and thus an improved light harvesting ability together with suppressed aggregation in DSSCs.

Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as a solution to the increasing appetite for energy as well as low-cost and eco-friendly alternatives to Si-based photovoltaic devices, have drawn worldwide attention in material innovation and device engineering.1 In order to cover a wide region of the solar spectrum, the broadness of the absorption band is considered as the most important feature of a good sensitizer.2 For this reason, porphyrins with a particularly broad absorption even up to a near IR region have been intensively exploited in DSSCs.2,3 Sensitized by donor(D)–porphyrin(π)–acceptor(A) triads, the conversion efficiencies up to 11.5% for iodine-based and 13% for Co(II/III)-based DSSCs have been achieved through the coadsorption/cosensitization approach.3d,4 Recent efforts have been focused on solving two major problems that hamper further advance of cell performances: the intrinsic optical window of porphyrins in the region of 450–550 nm and the dye aggregation that leads to unwanted charge recombination. Coabsorbates and cosensitizers are often introduced to solve these problems, but usually lead to unaffected or even decreased open-circuit voltage (Voc) or short-circuit current density (Jsc).4 In principle, a high concentration of dye could collect more light, but result in more serious dye aggregation. A solution to this self-contradictory situation could be to intensify the molar absorptivity of dyes. In this work, the significance of the intensity, rather than just the traditionally emphasized broadness, of the absorption band is addressed in developing DSSC sensitizers.2,3,5 With the assistance of theoretical prediction of the absorptivities, an efficient sensitizer CM-b is screened out. An overall efficiency of 10.7% is achieved, which has broken the record of 10.24% for non-ruthenium iodine-based DSSCs without a cosensitizer and a coabsorbate.3c
Results and discussion
Molecular design
A typical porphyrin displays an electronic absorption spectrum with a transition from the ground to the second excited state (S0 → S2) at around 400 nm (the Soret or B band) and a relatively weaker transition to the first excited state (S0 → S1) at around 550 nm (the Q band).6 Aiming at the design of efficient sensitizers, the Q transition polarized along the x-axis (Qx transition) of the D–π–A porphyrin is worthy of special attention for the following reasons. Firstly, the Qx transition, which is the first transition or the lowest-energy transition, can utilize more light in the solar spectrum than the other higher-energy transitions because transitions can be triggered by light with higher energy than necessary. Secondly, based on the Gouterman four orbital model,6 the Qx band is mainly assigned to the transition between the HOMO and LUMO (H → L), which are more involved in photodynamic cycles in DSSCs than other orbitals.2,6,7 Thirdly, from the viewpoint of anisotropy, donors and acceptors are both situated along the x-axis (as shown in Scheme 1) and thus exert more impact on the polarizability along the x-axis than that along the y-axis, which means that the Qx transition is more vulnerable to the modifications of donors and acceptors compared to the Q transition polarized along the y-axis (Qy transition).3d,7–9 The expansion of the Qx transition leads to capture of more photons and offers more chance for electron transfer to the TiO2 semiconductor along the x-axis.6c Although previous studies show that photovoltaic behaviour is relevant to the lowest-energy absorption band of sensitizers,3d,6,7 as far as we know, it has not been reported that the Qx absorptivity is employed to guide the discovery of highly efficient sensitizers for DSSCs.

The absorptivity, denoted by the area of the absorption band in electronic spectra, is proportional to the oscillator strength (f) as (1)where  is the wave number. The parameter f determines the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) at the given wavelength (λ) in the equation LHE(λ) = 1 − 10−f(2)
Thus, f could in turn determine the short-circuit current density (Jsc) as (3)because there are relatively small differences in input photon energy (I0(λ)), electron injection efficiency from the dye to TiO2 film (ϕinj(λ)) at the given λ and electron collection efficiency at the counter electrode (ηc) among solar cells sensitized by various dyes.2,8,9 The e value is a unit charge. The overall efficiency (η) is the product of the open-circuit voltage (Voc), Jsc and fill factor (FF) as follows:2 η = VocJscFF/Pinc(4)where Pinc is the incident solar power. Thus, the oscillator strength (f), especially for f of the first transition (f1), is closely correlated with the cell performance. Fortunately, the value of f1 can be estimated quantum chemically. Therefore, it is possible to discover efficient sensitizers with the assistance of the calculated f1 values.
We initiate our investigation by establishing a series of porphyrin-based D–π–A triads for calculation. Given efficient electron injection and diminished dye aggregation and charge recombination, the π–A segments containing 4-ethynylbenzoic acid as an electronic acceptor and long chain-wrapped porphyrin as a π-bridge are considered as an ideal platform to assemble donors.2,3 Considering that N,N-dimethyl-phenyl,3c,10 triphenylamine,11,12 carbozole,13N-annulated perylene14 and indoline15 are excellent electron donors, we herein screen porphyrin-based D–π–A triads with various donors including N,N-dimethyl-phenyl (A1), rotating (A2) or rigid (IDB) triphenylamine, N-carbozole phenyl (XW1), N-annulated perylene (WW3) and N-substituted indolines (CM-a1–c1) (Scheme 1). Among these donors, the indoline motifs are of specific interest due to their nonplanar geometry that may be bulky enough to reduce the molecular aggregation. YD2-o-C8-1 is included as the reference (YD2-o-C8 shown in Scheme 2 as the reference dye for comparison: the overall efficiencies of 9.4% for the iodide-based cell with a co-sensitizer and 12.3% for the Co(II/III)-based cell with a co-sensitizer).3b
 Scheme 2  Porphyrin dyes CM-a, CM-b and CM-c developed herein and the reference dye YD2-o-C8. 
With the established molecular library in hand, we calculated the oscillator strength (f) of the Qx transition (f1) of porphyrins based on the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)/B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) upon fully optimized structures. As shown in Table S1,† the first transition (Qx transition) is mainly assigned to the transition from the HOMO to LUMO (H → L) with large coefficients of 0.63–0.67, agreeing well with the Gouterman four orbital model. As shown in Scheme 1, the indoline derivative CM-b1 exhibits the largest f1 value among the nine porphyrins investigated. Based on the strong correlation between f1 and the photovoltaic efficiency, the calculation result suggests that CM-b has the best chance to be an efficient sensitizer in DSSCs. Thus, CM-b as well as analogues CM-a and CM-c were synthesized for further studies (Scheme 2).
Electronic absorption spectroscopy

Fig. 1a, Table 1 and Fig. S1† show the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of CM sensitizers in THF with the characteristic B band centered at around 448 nm, Qy band at around 575 nm and Qx at around 631 nm. Impressively, CM-b has an intensive molar absorptivity with large absorption coefficients of the B band (εB: 489000), the Qy band (εQy: 24500) and the Qx band (εQx: 56500), which are 2.3, 1.9 and 1.8 times those of YD2-o-C8, respectively. εQx of CM-b is even larger than that of the best-performed DSSC dye SM315 (53000 in THF).3d In addition to the molar extinction coefficient, another physically more meaningful parameter is the total area of the Qx absorption band (referred to as Qx integration). As shown in Table 1, the Qx integration () of CM-b is the largest among CM-a–c and 50% higher than that of YD2-o-C8, agreeing well with the predicted trends of f1.

Electrochemical study
Energy levels were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electronic spectra to examine the energetic alignment of dye–TiO2 and dye–I−/I3− redox couples (Fig. 1, S1 and S2†). As presented in Fig. 1b, the ground state oxidation potentials (Eox1/2) of CM-a, CM-b and CM-c sensitizers corresponding to HOMO levels are located at 0.74, 0.80 and 0.75 V (vs. normal hydrogen electrode, NHE), respectively. Compared to YD2-o-C8, a 20–80 mV uplift of HOMOs suggests that dye regeneration driving forces (ΔGreg) from the iodide redox couple to HOMOs of CM sensitizers are slightly weaker than that of YD2-o-C8. Qx absorption and emission maxima of CM sensitizers are hypochromatically shifted by 13–15 nm and 13–18 nm, respectively (Tables 1 and S3†). These blue shifts demonstrate the expansion of band gaps (E0–0) and thus lift the excited state oxidation potentials (), corresponding to the LUMO levels, from −1.07 V for YD2-o-C8 to −1.19, −1.14 and −1.18 V for CM-a, CM-b and CM-c sensitizers, respectively (Fig. 1b). As a result, electron injection driving forces (ΔGinj) from the LUMO of CM sensitizers to the TiO2 conduction band are 70–120 mV higher than that of YD2-o-C8.
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
Devices were fabricated with a CM-b-sensitized 13 μM-thick nanocrystalline TiO2 film covered by a 5 μM-thick scattering layer. Photovoltaic performances were measured under standard conditions (global AM1.5 sunlight with an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 at 298 K). Using electrolyte LCM0 containing 0.60 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII),16 the cell displayed a high efficiency of 9.0%.
Considering the relatively weaker ΔGreg values mentioned above, the recipe of the electrolyte was adjusted to increase the potential of the triiodide/iodide redox couple (EI3−/I−). When the concentration of DMPII (CDMPII) from 0.60 M (in LCM0) to 1.0 M (in LCM1) and 2.0 M (in LCM2) was increased, the Jsc values of CM-b climbed from 19.47 to 21.64 and 22.58 mA cm−2, respectively (Table 2 and Fig. 2a). A higher CDMPII was further tried up to 3.0 M but yielded a hardly soluble mixture. According to the standard potential of the triiodide/iodide redox couple (EI3−/I−) (354 mV vs. NHE)17 and the Nernst equation, the EI3−/I− values of LCM0–2 negatively shift from approximately 332 to 314 and 288 mV vs. NHE due to the increasing concentration of the reducing species iodide ion ionized from DMPII. Thus, compared with a cell with LCM0, the ΔGreg values for cells with LCM1 and LCM2 increase by approximately 18 and 44 mV, respectively, which could account for an increase in Jsc and a drop in Voc for CM-b sensitized cells. Simultaneously, the fill factor FF values are improved with the growth of CDMPII in the electrolyte, thus leading to a high η value of 10.7%.

The reference YD2-o-C8 cell gives an efficiency of 8.5%, which is similar to the results in the literature.3b,15e,18 Both Jsc and Voc values increase in the order of CM-a < CM-c < CM-b, resulting in an increase of conversion efficiency in the same order. Impressively, the efficiency of the CM-b cell is around 24% higher than that of the YD2-o-C8 cell under the same conditions.

Subsequently, twenty one CM-b cells were fabricated parallelly by employing the optimized iodide-based electrolyte LCM2 and exhibited stable performances (Fig. S3†). The overall efficiency reaches up to 10.7% (Voc = 734 mV, Jsc = 22.58 mA cm−2 and FF = 64.6%), which is comparable to those of the most efficient iodide-based DSSCs.3a,c In contrast, the device sensitized by a structurally similar indoline conjugated porphyrin VC-70 without long alkyl chains on the porphyrin achieves an efficiency of 7.31%, indicating that the modification of the 2,6-dioctoxy groups makes a significant contribution to the remarkable enhancement of the CM-b cell performance.15e
To better understand the photocurrent action at different wavelengths, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are collected in Fig. 2c. IPCE bands at around 630 nm, corresponding to Qx absorption bands, exhibit peak values in the sequence of YD2-o-C8 (76%) < CM-a (84%) < CM-c (87%) < CM-b (93%). The dips of IPCE spectra around 525 nm, which are typically deep and broad and thought of as a disadvantage of porphyrin-based cells, are here relatively shallow with valley values in the order of YD2-o-C8 (58%) ≈ CM-a (59%) < CM-c (61%) < CM-b (74%). Notably, IPCE values over nearly the whole spectrum for the CM cells surpass that of the YD2-o-C8 cell under this condition. Thus, the integrated Jsc values from the IPCE spectrum increase in a trend of YD2-o-C8 (16.9 mA cm−2) < CM-a (17.3 mA cm−2) < CM-c (18.1 mA cm−2) < CM-b (19.3 mA cm−2), which coincides with the upward trend of Jsc values obtained in photovoltaic measurements. The integrated Jsc values are around 10% smaller than those from J–V curves (Table 3), which is possibly ascribed to the different charge transport/collection efficiencies and thermal effects associated with the different incident power between monochromic light and full sunlight.4b,19,20 Impressively, the CM-b sensitized solar cell displays high IPCE values exceeding 80% throughout the whole visible region (from 413 to 670 nm) except a small dip around 525 nm, which leads to significantly high Jsc values.
To clarify the origin of high Jsc and IPCE values, the light harvesting ability was then evaluated by transmittance spectra of the TiO2 film (7 μM) colorized in a 0.10 mM solution of dye. As illustrated in Fig. 2d, the CM colorized TiO2 exhibits large LHE values of above 90% broadly spanning over the blue-green region (350–500 nm) and the red region (556–649 nm). Compared to the dyes in solution (Fig. 1a and S1†), the dyes loaded on TiO2 show considerably broadened and red-shifted spectra with the absorption edge moving from around 660 to 690 nm (Fig. 2d). These changes may be attributed to the dye–dye and/or dye–TiO2 interactions, which are favorable to the harvesting of light in the far red region.12b Notably, CM colorized TiO2 displays intensive absorptions in the optical windows of porphyrins (450–550 nm) with LHE valley values around 77–85%. Such shallow dips in LHE spectra would allow high IPCE and η values without the necessity of any cosensitizer.2d,13
Dye loading amount analysis
In principle, LHE enhancement could be achieved by either increasing the dye loading amount (Γ) or intensifying molar absorptivity.2 The Γ value was thus measured by UV-vis-NIR absorption of the dye detached from the colorized 13 μM-thick TiO2 film. As a result, the Γ values of CM sensitizers are much smaller than that of YD2-o-C8 (Table 4, Fig. S4 and S5†). We rationalized that it could be ascribed to the increasing nonplanarity and rigidity of the indoline unit in comparison to the diphenylamino group of YD2-o-C8. Hence, it is not necessary to use chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), one of the widely used coadsorbates,2b–d to lower the Γ value of CM-b (Fig. S6†). Its Γ value could be well controlled below 1.4 × 10−7 mol cm−2 even under higher concentrations of colorizing solutions (Fig. S7†). More attractively, CM-b displays an LHE value comparable to YD2-o-C8 even when the Γ value of CM-b is nearly twice as small. These observations hint that a high LHE of CM-b loaded TiO2 may originate from stronger light absorbing ability of individual molecules rather than the larger dye loading amount, and further demonstrate the significance of molar absorptivity (Table 1).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Generally, a high concentration of sensitizers could lead to unwanted charge recombination (CR) by the dye aggregation.2 To further investigate the charge transfer process, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the dark to determine interface CR resistance (Rcr), effective capacitance (Cμ) and electron lifetime (τ) (Tables 4 and S5 and Fig. S8†).8,12b,13 The resistance of charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (Rce) increases in the sequence of YD2-o-C8 ≈ CM-c < CM-a < CM-b devices, as shown by the radius of the first semi-circle of the Nyquist plot (Fig. S8†).11b This could be attributed to the different distribution and diffusion velocity of the electrolyte (e.g., I− and I3−) in the interspace of dyes with the diversified molecular geometry, polarity, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity and intermolecular packing model on TiO2.2,19a The Cμ values increase in the order of CM-a < YD2-o-C8 < CM-b < CM-c, suggesting a sequential positive shift of TiO2 conduction band edges. The Rcr and τ values both increase in the order of CM-a < YD2-o-C8 < CM-c < CM-b, indicating that charge transfer from TiO2 back to the oxidized dye (CR1) and redox couple (CR2) is more difficult and slower in the CM-b sensitized cell than the others. These observed inconsistent sequences reveal that a relatively high Voc for the CM-b sensitized cell is determined predominantly by the suppressed charge recombination rather than the shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge.13 Notably, the Rcr and τ values of the CM-b cell are nearly twice those of the YD2-o-C8 cell, which indicates that the remarkably enhanced Jsc and η values of the CM-b cell may arise from the considerably suppressed charge recombination.
Conclusions
In this work, we suppose that increasing the molar absorptivity of dye is an efficient approach to collect more light without needing to increase the dye-loadings that is a key factor leading to dye aggregation in DSSCs. This assumption has herein been proven via a theoretical prediction-and-experimental verification approach. The oscillator strength of the first transition (f1) is calculated to guide the discovery of the novel porphyrin sensitizer. CM-b is screened out to have an impressively large Qx molar absorptivity and thus an improved light harvesting ability and simultaneously suppressed charge recombination in DSSCs. An overall efficiency of 10.7% for the iodine-based DSSC is achieved in the absence of a cosensitizer and a coabsorbate, which is around 24% higher than that of the reference YD2-o-C8 cell under the same conditions. This prediction-and-verification approach could reduce time and cost consumption in the traditional trial-and-error experimental approach and accelerate the discovery of highly efficient sensitizers. Considering the energy-level distribution, further enhancement of cell efficiency is anticipated by using the Co3+/Co2+ redox couple based electrolyte,2,3b,d which is under investigation in our lab.
Experimental
Solar cell fabrication
A Pt-counter electrode and two types of TiO2 films were purchased from OPV Tech (China) Co., Ltd. A 7 μm-thick film of 20 nm TiO2 particles as the absorbing layer coated with an active area of 1.0 × 1.0 cm2 on a FTO glass (6.0–8.0 Ω sq.−1, haze 3.0–8.0%, transmission in the visible region > 80%) was used to determine LHE. A 13 μm-thick film of 20 nm TiO2 particles as the absorbing layer covered by a 5 μm-thick film of 400 nm TiO2 particles as the scattering layer with an active area of 0.4 × 0.4 cm2 coated on a FTO glass substrate (6.0–8.0 Ω sq.−1, haze 3.0–8.0%, transmission in the visible region > 80%) was used to assemble DSSCs. No mask was used. The sensitizer, without any coadsorbate, was dissolved in a mixed solvent of CHCl3 and EtOH (4/6, v:v) and exposed to ultrasound for 10 minutes to give the colorizing solution (0.10 mM). TiO2 coated FTO glass was immersed into the solution at 35 °C overnight. The dye-loaded TiO2 anode was then rinsed with CH2Cl2/EtOH (1/1, v:v) and dried in air. The dye-loaded TiO2 anode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt parafilm with a small gap. A drop of electrolyte solution was then injected into the cell via a syringe.

 	Scheme 2  Porphyrin dyes CM-a, CM-b and CM-c developed herein and the reference dye YD2-o-C8.	 

 	Fig. 1  (a) Electronic spectra of CM-b. UV-vis-NIR (black line and axes), and normalized emission (red line and bottom x-axis) measured in THF solution (4.0 × 10−6 M) as well as excited energy calculated by TDDFT/B3LYP/6-31(d,p) (green line and axes). Due to a systematic underestimation of the TDDFT/B3LYP calculation, a 25 nm bias of wavelengths (x-axes) exists between the calculated data (top x-axis) and the measured data (bottom x-axis). (b) Energy level diagrams of CM and YD2-o-C8 sensitizers, TiO2 conduction band and redox couple. inj: injection; CR: charge recombination; reg: regeneration.
