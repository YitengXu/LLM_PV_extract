    , Accepted 14th January 2019First published on 16th January 2019AbstractCharge extraction efficiency is one of the key factors to determine the performance of solar cells, which depends on the electronic properties of the electron and hole transporting layers. Sol–gel derived NiOx as the hole transporting layer (HTL) used in perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) promises both low-cost and high-stability. However, current NiOx based PVSCs have a relatively low fill factor (FF) and device efficiency. Here, we show that using an oxide composite approach by incorporating thermally reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into the NiOx layer (NiOx:rGO) can effectively improve the film conductivity without sacrificing its high work function. The improved charge extraction efficiency reduces the interfacial recombination loss and increases the carrier lifetime in NiOx:rGO based PVSCs, which are evidenced by transient photocurrent and transient photovoltage measurements. The NiOx:rGO based PVSC achieves a promising PCE of 19.1% with a significantly improved FF from 73% to 81% compared to the device using solely NiOx. Moreover, the NiOx:rGO based PVSC shows a decent photo-stability tracked at the maximum-power-point and a long shelf-lifetime with negligible degradation in device performance after 70 days. It is believed that the oxide composite transporting layer would be a promising alternative to further develop highly efficient and stable PVSCs.
1. Introduction
Organometallic halide perovskites have emerged as promising semiconducting materials for optoelectronic device applications due to their tuneable bandgap, high carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length, and solution processability.1–4 Particularly, perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have attracted tremendous attention in the last decade due to their rapid progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.9% to 23.3%.5,6 Generally, PVSCs can be fabricated with conventional n–i–p or p–i–n architectures depending on the choice of interlayer materials used in the cathode and anode.7–9 In principle, both architectures can achieve similar performance. However, the processing conditions of the interlayers would determine the viability of the technology for large-scale production. Although the recorded PCE for PVSCs has been demonstrated with conventional architecture using mesoporous titania (m-TiO2) as the electron transport layer (ETL), the fabrication process of the m-TiO2 requires both high-temperature (500 °C) and long-duration (2–5 h) sintering.10,11 Such a large amount of energy input increases the energy payback time and hinders its competitiveness in the market. Alternatively, planar p–i–n PVSCs with polymers or metal oxides as the bottom hole transporting layer (HTL) are achieving impressive progress in both device efficiency and stability.12–14 Particularly, those HTLs only require a relatively low temperature process which is more compatible with the large-scale production. In such a planar inverted structure, the electronic and surface properties of the HTL are critical in determining the quality of the perovskite layer deposited on top. Specifically, the HTL should have favourable surface energy for perovskite crystallization and film formation, high optical transparency, good conductivity and high work function for efficient charge extraction.15
Various organic and inorganic p-type semiconductors have been used as the HTLs for planar inverted PVSCs. For organic HTLs, PEDOT:PSS,16,17 PTAA,18 and PolyTPD19,20 are the widely used HTL materials due to their relatively high work function and good hole transporting properties. However, the major concerns of organic HTLs are the cost and stability. Typically, those conjugating polymers are of high cost limited by the required synthesis route and yield. In addition, the polymers tend to aggregate at moderate temperature under continuous light-soaking, which would affect the device stability. In contrast, recently reported PVSCs using solution processed p-type inorganic materials such as NiOx,21,22 MoOx·WOx,23,24 and CuSCN25,26 have demonstrated superior stability which can be processed with low cost. Eventually, developing inorganic HTLs for highly efficient devices using a large-scale fabrication method has become a strategic direction in both research and industry.
Among those inorganic materials, NiOx is particularly promising due to its high chemical stability, wide bandgap (3.75 eV), and deep valence band (>5.2 eV) to facilitate a large internal electrical field for efficient charge extraction.21 The high conduction band edge of NiOx can also effectively reduce recombination by blocking electrons from transporting to the anode. Compared with PEDOT:PSS, the deeper valence band of NiOx provides higher photovoltage in planar inverted PVSCs (1.05–1.11 V). However, the sol–gel derived NiOx based PVSCs typically suffer from a low fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current (Jsc).27 Chen et al. reported that the charge carrier extraction efficiency of NiO HTL was not sufficient to deliver the large photocurrent (20–23 mA cm−2) generated in PVSCs.21 It is well known that the FF is determined by the competition between the charge extraction and recombination.28 Therefore, increasing the conductivity of the NiOx HTL is necessary to overcome the charge recombination issue. Various strategies have been developed to improve the conductivity of NiOx films. Heteroatom doping is one of the most commonly used approaches. For instance, Kim et al. demonstrated that the conductivity of NiOx films could be improved via Cu atom doping by 40 times. Both the FF and Jsc of NiOx:Cu based planar inverted PVSCs have be increased, resulting in an overall improvement of PCE from 8.9% to 15.4%.29 Similarly, a high efficiency of 18.3% has been achieved on Li and Mg co-doped NiOx films.21 Recently, Chen et al. reported that the hole extraction efficiency of NiOx was significantly improved by Cs doping. PVSCs based on NiOx:Cs HTLs exhibited a high PCE of over 19%.30 However, the improvement from doping is significantly dependent on the selection of the dopant atoms: (1) size mismatched atoms are difficult to be doped into the NiOx lattice, and (2) chemical doping would change the electronic properties of the NiOx layer which may sacrifices its high work function and reduces the device Voc.31
Herein, we present a physical oxide composite strategy by which the conductivity of the NiOx layer can be enhanced. Specifically, a small number of graphene oxide (GO) sheets are uniformly dispersed into the NiOx sol–gel precursor solution. During the formation of the NiOx layer, the GO sheets are in situ thermally reduced to more conductive reduced GO (rGO) within the NiOx layer (NiOx:rGO). We believe that the rGO sheets act as conductive binders to connect the NiOx particles and improve the film morphology and conductivity. It is experimentally confirmed that the conductivity of NiOx:rGO has been increased more than two-fold. In addition, different from previous chemical doping methods, the oxide composite approach does not change the electronic properties of NiOx and keeps its high work function for large device Voc. We find that the morphology of the NiOx:rGO composite film is highly sensitive to the content of rGO. After the optimization, the PVSC based on our NiOx:rGO layer achieves a promising PCE of 19.1% with a significantly improved FF from 73% to 81% compared to the device using sole NiOx as the HTL. The origin of the enhanced PCE and FF is experimentally evidenced to be the more efficient charge extraction in the NiOx:rGO layer. Moreover, the NiOx:rGO based PVSC shows a decent photo-stability tracked at the maximum-power-point and a long shelf-lifetime with negligible degradation in device performance after 70 days.
2. Results and discussion
In the planar p–i–n PVSCs, the MAPbI3 perovskite is deposited on the HTL using a typical one-step deposition method, and the details of the deposition conditions are described in the Experimental section. Firstly, the crystal quality and film properties of the perovskite layer grown on different HTLs are compared. Fig. 1 presents the (a) XRD patterns, (b) UV-vis absorption spectra and (c, d) SEM morphology of perovskite films grown on PEDOT:PSS and NiOx. The films show a similar diffraction pattern with major perovskite peaks located at 14.1° (110), 28.4° (220) and 42.1° (310) (Fig. 1a). Similar optical absorbance spectra are also found in both films as shown in Fig. 1b. Notably, the grain size of perovskite grown on NiOx is much larger than that on PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 1c, d). This is because the relatively non-wetting NiOx surface reduces the number of perovskite nucleation sites facilitating the larger crystal growth.32

Fig. 2a shows the photovoltaic performance of the PVSCs using PEDOT:PSS and NiOx as the HTL. It is obvious that the PVSC based on NiOx exhibits better device performance, mainly due to a larger Voc of 1.03 V compared to 0.90 V of the device based on PEDOT:PSS. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of these two devices are summarized in Table S1.† The larger Voc of the device is due to the higher work function of the NiOx layer as evidenced by the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements. As shown in Fig. 2b, the work function of the PEDOT:PSS layer is 5.05 eV, which agrees well with previous reports.33,34 In contrast, the work function of the NiOx layer is 5.28 eV. As a consequence, the higher work function of NiOx increases the build-in potential and therefore leads to a higher Voc. Although the overall PCE of the NiOx based PVSC has been increased to 15.6%, the serial resistance of the NiOx based device is two times larger than that of the device using PEDOT:PSS. Higher resistance in the NiOx film is believed to be an intrinsic issue of using the sol–gel method, where the film is composed of only a short-range ordered nanostructure.

Inspired by previous reports using graphene or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to increase the film conductivity,35–38 herein we disperse the GO sheets into the NiOx sol–gel precursor solution. During the formation of the NiOx layer, the GO sheets are in situ thermally reduced to more conductive rGO within the NiOx matrix.39,40Fig. 3 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the NiOx layers with different GO volume ratios (1%, 2%, 5%, 10% and 20% vol.). It can be seen that the surface of the NiOx layer remains uniform and free of pin holes when the GO is at a less than 2% volume ratio. However, when the GO content exceeds 5%, the root mean square roughness largely increases from 2.3 (0% vol.) to 6.5 nm (20% vol.). It is speculated that the increased surface roughness is due to the aggregation of excessive GO sheets during the spin coating and post-annealing treatment. Owing to the increased surface roughness, as will be discussed later, the PVSC performance is very sensitive to the GO content in the NiOx precursor solution.

Fig. 4a shows the transmittance electron microscopy (TEM) image of GO, which has an obvious layer structure and smooth surface. To confirm the reduction reaction from GO to rGO during the thermal annealing process, Fig. 4b shows the Raman spectra of GO before and after 300 °C annealing for 1 h, where the G peak (∼1560 cm−1) refers to the in-plane vibration of sp2 carbon and the D peak (∼1350 cm−1) refers to the structural defect peak in graphene oxide.41 The intensity ratio of D/G has decreased after annealing, indicating an increase of graphene domains in the GO. The reduction of GO to rGO can also be proved by XRD analysis.42 As shown in Fig. S1,† the GO diffraction peak at 10.1° has disappeared while a broad peak at 24.4° (rGO) can be observed after thermal annealing at 300 °C, corresponding to reduction of interlayer spacing. Fig. S2† presents the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra before and after thermal annealing treatment. It can be observed that the intensity of the peak related to C–O functional groups has significantly decreased with annealing at 300 °C, indicating that the GO is reduced to rGO. To investigate the effect of the GO additives on the conductivity of the NiOx films, we attempted to fabricate a metal-oxide only device and measure its J–V characteristics. However, it was challenging to fabricate a device with a sandwiched anode/metal-oxide/cathode structure. Depositing a metal-oxide film more than 50 nm required a more concentrated solution, where the deposited film was too rough to obtain any reliable result. Alternatively, as shown in Fig. 4c, we fabricated lateral devices to measure the electrical response of the NiOx:rGO thin films. The conductivity σ of the films was calculated by using the following equation: σ = L/(AR)(1)where L is the channel length (50 μm), A is the cross-sectional area of films (4 × 10−10 m2), and R is the resistance of films derived from the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics. As shown in Fig. 3d, the NiOx:rGO (2% vol.) film exhibits higher current than the pure NiOx films. The conductivities of NiOx:rGO (2% vol.) and NiOx films are estimated to be 5.19 × 10−4 S m−1 and 1.25 × 10−4 S m−1, respectively. These results are consistent with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra shown in Fig. S3,† where the charge transport resistance has been significantly reduced from 269 Ω to 83.2 Ω in the NiOx:rGO based device.

PVSCs with an inverted planar architecture of FTO/NiOx:rGO/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag were fabricated with different GO contents. Fig. 5a presents the J–V characteristics of the devices measured under AM 1.5G one sun solar irradiation. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The best device performance was obtained with a 2% GO vol. ratio in NiOx precursor solution, mainly due to the improvement in FF from 71% to 81%. Such an improvement can be reflected by the reduced series resistance from 5.25 to 3.15 Ω cm2 and increased shunt resistance from 0.7 to 2.7 kΩ cm2, contributed by the increased conductivity of the oxide composite film. However, further increasing the GO content to larger than 5% reduces the FF, which is attributed to the increased roughness of the composite films as observed in the AFM images. This is due to the fact that precursor solutions with excessive GO sheets fail to form continuous films, which partly results in an undesirable contact of the perovskite and FTO. Fig. 5b shows the statistical results of the device performance using NiOx and NiOx:rGO (2% vol.) as the HTLs. The PVSCs based on NiOx:rGO (2% vol.) have a higher average PCE of 18.1% with a smaller standard deviation.

The perovskite crystal grown on NiOx:rGO (2% vol.) and the charge extraction efficiency at the NiOx:rGO/perovskite interface were investigated. Fig. 6a and b show the top-view SEM images of the MAPbI3 perovskite on NiOx and NiOx:rGO (2% vol.) respectively. Both films exhibit a uniform surface morphology with a grain size up to 1 μm. According to the UV-vis absorption spectra of NiOx and NiOx:rGO films (Fig. S4†), strong edge-band absorption at 365 nm can be observed, corresponding to a bandgap of 3.40 eV. In addition, as shown in Fig. 6c, the UPS spectra of NiOx and NiOx:rGO (2% vol.) show a similar photoemission cut-off and onset energy, which indicates that the additional rGO has no influence on the work function and valence band energy of the NiOx film. Therefore, the observed slight increase in Voc from 1.03 V to 1.07 V should be ascribed to the reduced charge carrier recombination at the NiOx:rGO/perovskite interfaces.

Fig. 7 shows the transient photocurrent (TPC) results measured under short-circuit conditions (Vapply = 0) and transient photovoltage (TPV) results measured under open-circuit conditions (Vapply = Voc) of the PVSCs based on NiOx and NiOx:rGO (2% vol.). As shown in Fig. 7a, the photocurrent in the NiOx:rGO based PVSC deceases faster (0.48 μs) than that of the NiOx based device (0.78 μs). This indicates that the carrier extraction in the NiOx:rGO based PVSC is more efficient under the internal electrical field. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 7b, the NiOx:rGO based device exhibits a longer photovoltage decay (3.39 μs) compared to the NiOx based device (2.35 μs). As the TPV of the devices was recorded under open-circuit conditions, the longer decay time suggests a longer carrier lifetime and smaller recombination. The above TPC and TPV results suggest that the observed improvement in FF and Voc in the NiOx:rGO based PVSC is ascribed to the more efficient charge extraction and reduced recombination at the NiOx:rGO/perovskite interface.43,44 The reduced recombination is also supported by the light intensity dependent Voc results as shown in Fig. S5.†

We sought to further investigate the hysteresis and photo-stability of the device with NiOx:rGO (2% vol). Fig. 8a shows the J–V characteristics of the champion PVSC, which has negligible hysteresis with a PCE of 19.1%. The corresponding EQE and integrated Jsc are shown in Fig. 8b. Moreover, the NiOx:rGO based device exhibits a stable photocurrent under continuous illumination. As shown in Fig. 8c, the device has a steady state photocurrent of 21.09 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 18.5% at the maximum-power-point for over 800 s. The device also shows excellent shelf-lifetime, as shown in Fig. S6,† which retains 95% of the initial efficiency after 70 days. The excellent stability of NiOx:rGO based PVSCs is attributed to the excellent stability of the NiOx layer and the GO additives.

3. Conclusions
In summary, GO sheets have been uniformly dispersed into a NiOx sol–gel precursor solution. During the formation of the NiOx layer, the GO sheets are in situ thermally reduced to more conductive rGO within the NiOx matrix. Owing to the enhanced conductivity of the NiOx:rGO oxide composite layer, the PVSC exhibits a champion PCE of 19.1% with enhanced Jsc (from 20.8 to 22.1 mA cm−2) and FF (from 73% to 81%) compared to the pure NiOx counterpart. The superior performance of NiOx:rGO based PVSCs is attributed to the efficient charge extraction and the reduced recombination at the NiOx:rGO/perovskite interface. Moreover, the NiOx:rGO based PVSCs have shown decent photo-stability tracked at the maximum-power-point and a long shelf-lifetime in ambient air. This work demonstrates the large potential of using oxide composites to further improve the efficiency and stability of PVSCs.
4. Experimental
Preparation of the NiOx/GO precursor solution
Firstly, the graphene oxide was synthesized by a modified Hummers' method.45 Briefly, graphite powder (0.5 g) was mixed with concentrated sulfuric acid (17 mL) and potassium nitrate (0.45 g) and stirred for 20 min in an ice bath. Next, 2.25 g of potassium permanganate was slowly added to the mixture for 1 h. The solution was stirred for an extra 2 h in the ice bath, and then removed. The mixture remained under stirring for 5 days to fully insert oxygen functional groups. After that, the black viscous liquid was diluted with a 50 mL aqueous solution of 5 wt% HCl, and then kept stirring for an extra 2 h. Finally, 1.5 g of hydrogen peroxide (30 wt% aqueous) was added to the mixture under continuous stirring. Then the material was washed with deionized (DI) water until a pH value close to 7 was reached. The as-obtained products were collected by centrifugation and freeze dried for 2 days. The NiOx precursor was prepared by dissolving 248.8 mg nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(OAc)2·4H2O) and 60 μL monoethanolamine (MEA) in 10 mL ethanol, and then stirring at 65 °C for 40 minutes. For the preparation of the NiOx/GO precursor solution, we have prepared the GO ethanol solution first and then mixed it with NiOx precursor solution with various vol% (1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20%, respectively).
Device fabrication
Patterned FTO glass was cleaned in the solvents of DI water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol subsequently. Then the cleaned FTO glass was treated in an ultraviolet-ozone cleaner for 20 min. The hole transport layer was prepared on the cleaned FTO by spin coating the precursor solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s, and then annealing at 300 °C for 1 h. For the GO:NiOx precursor solution, GO was thermally reduced to more conductive sheets during the annealing, leading to NiOx:rGO films. The perovskite layer was deposited by the typical one-step method. In this method, 461 mg PbI2 and 159 mg MAI were dissolved in 1 mL DMF and 79 μL DMSO to form the perovskite precursor solution. Then the perovskite film was formed by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. 100 μL toluene was dropped at 8 s as the antisolvent. Then the films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, PCBM in anhydrous chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1) was spin coated at 2000 rpm for 45 s as the electron transport layer. The bathocuproine (BCP) in ethanol (2 mg mL−1) was deposited on the PCBM at 2000 rpm for 45 s. Finally, 80 nm sliver electrodes were deposited in thermal evaporators.
Characterisation
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted on a Philips X0 Pert diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Absorption spectra were measured on a PerkinElmer model Lambda 2S UV-vis spectrometer. The top-view morphologies of perovskite films were characterized by using a Philips XL30 FEG scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a Philips CM 200 FEG. The surface morphologies of NiOx with different GO contents were characterized by using a NanoScope MultiMode atomic force microscope (AFM) in tapping mode. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of perovskite solar cells were measured on a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G solar illumination with a standard power of 100 mW cm−2. The stabilized photocurrent and PCE were measured at the bias voltage obtained from the maximum power point in the typical J–V curve. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out on a home-built set-up equipped with a 1000 W xenon arc lamp (Newport), lock-in amplifier (Standard Research SR830) and current amplifier (Standard Research SR570).46 The EIS spectra were recorded on a ZAHNER IM6 workstation under open circuit conditions. The frequency range was from 1 Hz to 106 Hz. For the transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurement, the devices were connected to 1 MΩ and 50 Ω input terminals, respectively. A double-frequency Nd:YAG pulse laser was used to excited the devices. The transient signals were collected with a digital oscilloscope (HP54810A). Additional one sun illumination was also required for TPV measurement. The UPS measurement was conducted on a K-ALPHA+ Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectrometer under ultrahigh vacuum (10−9 mbar).
