    , Accepted 16th December 2010First published on 19th January 2011AbstractThe electrochemical deposition of Ga and Cu–Ga alloys from the deep eutectic solvent choline chloride/urea (Reline) is investigated to prepare CuGaSe2 (CGS) semiconductors for their use in thin film solar cells. Ga electrodeposition is difficult from aqueous solution due to its low standard potential and the interfering hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ionic liquid electrolytes offer a better thermal stability and larger potential window and thus eliminate the interference of solvent breakdown reactions during Ga deposition. We demonstrate that metallic Ga can be electrodeposited from Reline without HER interference with high plating efficiency on Mo and Cu electrodes. A new low cost synthetic route for the preparation of CuGaSe2 absorber thin films is presented and involves the one-step electrodeposition of Cu–Ga precursors from Reline followed by thermal annealing. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) cyclic voltammetry (CV) is used in combination with viscosity measurements to determine the diffusion coefficients of gallium and copper ions in Reline. The composition of the codeposited Cu–Ga precursor layers can be controlled to form Cu/Ga thin films with precise stoichiometry, which is important for achieving good optoelectronic properties of the final CuGaSe2 absorbers. The morphology, the chemical composition and the crystal structure of the deposited thin films are analysed by scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Annealing of the Cu–Ga films in a selenium atmosphere allowed the formation of high quality CuGaSe2 absorber layers. Completed CGS solar cells achieved a 4.1% total area power conversion efficiency.
1. Introduction
The reduction of manufacturing costs is a key point for photovoltaics (PV) to establish as a major affordable renewable energy source of the future. One approach to lower PV costs is the use of thin film technology in which absorber layers (1 to 5 μm) of photoactive semiconductors, such as chalcopyrites Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2, are deposited on inexpensive large-area substrates. Thin film solar cells based on Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorber layers have demonstrated power conversion efficiencies of 20.1% in laboratory devices1 and CIGS modules have been successfully produced on an industrial scale with efficiencies of 14.2%.2 These compounds have high optical absorption coefficients (α > 105 cm−1) and the band gap can be tuned depending on the Ga content between 1.04 eV for CuInSe2 (CIS) and 1.68 eV for CuGaSe2 (CGS). The best performing CIGS solar cells have a Ga/(In + Ga) content of around 30% and demonstrate that precise Ga incorporation is essential for high efficiency chalcopyrite thin film solar cells.3

Electrodeposition and post-annealing (EDA) is recognised as a promising low cost and energy fabrication route for CIGS absorber layers, as it is up-scalable to module production and economical in material usage.4 The challenge for the EDA process is the controlled incorporation of Ga into the absorber thin films. The electrodeposition of Ga from aqueous electrolytes is very difficult due to its low standard potential (−0.53 V vs.SHE), meaning that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) interferes with the electrodeposition process. This side-reaction reduces the plating efficiency, induces the deposition of gallium oxides and hydroxides and has destructive impacts on the thin film quality, such as pinholing and dendritic morphology. Extreme pH conditions, as well as additional, very often toxic, complexing agents (e.g.cyanide, thiocyanide) are necessary to obtain Ga electrodeposits for chalcopyrite absorber layers.5–11 Moreover long term deposition bath stability problems have been observed.12
An alternative is to use ionic liquids as electrolytes. These liquids present several interesting properties compared to aqueous electrolytes including high thermal stability and large potential windows, allowing the deposition of reactive metals with low standard potentials13 and the formation of compound semiconductors at high temperature.14,15
So far, only a few papers have reported on Ga electrodeposition from ionic liquids. In the early 1990's Verbrugge and Carpenter16 investigated the electrodeposition of Ga from Lewis basic GaCl3/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid (40/60 mol%) on platinum microelectrodes. Thermodynamic and kinetic data were determined and a mechanism for Ga electrodeposition was proposed. By adding AsCl3 to the Lewis basic GaCl3/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid the authors realised the electrodeposition of GaAs at room temperature.17 Nevertheless, chlorogallate ionic liquids have not found practical applications, because of their aggressive chemical nature. Chen et al.18 studied the electrodeposition of Ga from a Lewis acid AlCl3/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid (60/40 mol%) on glassy carbon and tungsten electrodes. The electrodeposition of Ga at glassy carbon was found to involve instantaneous nucleation with diffusion-controlled growth. Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) analysis of the Ga deposits on tungsten revealed no Al contamination from the ionic liquid. As for the previous ionic liquids, the practical use of the reactive chloroaluminate ionic liquids was limited. More recently, Gasparotto et al.19 employed the air- and water stable ionic liquid 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluoromethylsulfonyl)amide ([BMP]Tf2N) containing GaCl3 to study the electrodeposition of Ga on Au(111) by in situscanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The authors reported the electrochemical and electroless deposition of Ga on Au (111). No electroless Ga deposits were observed when glassy carbon or platinum electrodes were employed. Compared to chloroaluminate and chlorogallate ionic liquids, the air- and moisture stability facilitates the use of [BMP]Tf2N. This liquid presents however low solubility for copper ions. Copper has to be introduced by anodic dissolution of a copper electrode.20
Abbott et al.21 have developed a deep eutectic solvent (DES), consisting of choline chloride and urea (Reline), that presents properties similar to room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). The constituents, choline chloride (vitamin B4) and urea (a common fertilizer), are produced at megatons per year scales. Compared to room temperature ionic liquids, Reline is cheap, easy to manipulate, non-toxic and biodegradable.22 Moreover this ionic liquid presents a very good solubility of a large range of metal oxides and chlorides.23,24 These properties qualify Reline as a good candidate for the electrodeposition of chalcopyrite thin films for large scale production, compared to other RTILs. Shivagan et al.25 have briefly reported that Reline can be used for the electrodeposition of Cu–In–(Ga)–Se precursor layers. However, neither details on the electrochemical process, nor data on solar cell performances have been presented. The Ga incorporation into the Cu–In–Se precursors was very low with Ga/(In + Ga) = 6–8%25 even at high GaCl3 concentrations (40–80 mM) in the deposition bath. The authors conclude that the incorporation of higher levels of gallium is necessary and a better definition of the electrochemical process has to be developed.25
In this paper we present a comprehensive electrochemical study of Ga electrodeposition from Reline on Mo and Cu electrodes. A new synthetic EDA route for CuGaSe2 absorber films, via the one-step coelectrodeposition of Cu–Ga precursor thin films from Reline, is reported. The new process allows for the first time the controlled, highly current efficient incorporation of Ga for the preparation of wide gap chalcopyrites26 (Eg > 1.5 eV). The stoichiometry of the codeposited Cu–Ga layers is precisely controlled and can be adjusted by varying the deposition conditions. The electrochemical system has been characterized by a combination of electrochemical techniques, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry and rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry. The successful conversion of stoichiometric Cu–Ga precursor films, without gallium loss during annealing, into p-type CuGaSe2 absorber layers is reported. A new record 4.1% power conversion efficiency EDA–CuGaSe2 solar cell is achieved by the developed process.
2. Experimental
All precursor preparation was carried out in a nitrogen filled glovebox (MBraun Unilab) with water and oxygen contents below 1 ppm. Choline chloride (Sigma 99%) and urea (Sigma 99.5%) were dried under vacuum in the presence of phosphorous pentoxide desiccant (Sigma) and mixed in a 1∶2 molar ratio at 80 °C until a transparent liquid was formed. Anhydrous CuCl2 (Alfa Aesar 99.995%) and GaCl3 (Alfa Aesar 99.999%) were used as received. All electrochemical experiments were performed in a standard three electrode cell, connected to an Ecochemie μAutolab type III potentiostat. The counter electrode was a large area platinum foil, the reference electrode was a silver wire. The working electrode consisted either of a Mo disk (5 mm diameter) embedded in polyetheretherketone (PEEK) for rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry or of a Mo film sputtered on soda lime glass with an area of 2 × 2 cm2 mounted in a custom polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) RDE head for bulk electrodeposition. Mo substrates were used as they present an ideal back-contact for chalcopyrite thin film solar cells. Electrodeposition of the precursor films was performed at a rotation speed of 300 rpm for 30 min at 60 °C. The substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in a 5% Decon 90 surfactant solution, water and ethanol prior to use. The deposits were washed with ultrapure water and ethanol to remove Reline and dried under nitrogen. The electrodeposited mass was determined by dissolving the sample in aqua regia (HCl/HNO3 3/1) and measured by means of Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS) (Perkin Elmer ELAN DRC-e).
Conversion to CuGaSe2 absorber layers was accomplished by annealing of the codeposited Cu–Ga precursors in a mixture of elemental selenium vapour and 90/10 N2/H2 gas at 10 mbar for 45 min at 550 °C. Complete devices were realised by addition of a chemical bath deposited CdS, sputtered i-ZnO and Al∶ZnO and a Ni/Al front-contact.

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker Discover D8 Diffractometer with a Cu Kα1/2 source and a scintillation detector in θ–2θ configuration. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Hitachi SU-70 equipped with an Oxford Instruments INCA X-MAX analyser for Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). Viscosity measurements were realised on a ThermoFisher Scientific Haake MARS II rheometer with the 4° cone/plate geometry in a temperature controlled test chamber consisting of two chamber halves for a homogeneous temperature distribution. Finished devices were characterised by current–voltage measurements under a standard halogen cold mirror lamp illumination (100 mW cm−2, 25 °C) using a four point probe configuration.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 
          Cyclic voltammetry of Ga on Mo
The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of a Mo electrode in (a) Reline and (b) Reline containing 50 mM GaCl3, recorded at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 at 60 °C, are shown in Fig. 1. From curve (a) it can be observed that the Reline exhibits an electrochemical stability window of around 2.5 V on Mo, ranging from −1.4 V to +1.1 V vs. Ag.
 Fig. 1  
            Cyclic voltammograms of a Mo electrode in (a) Reline and (b) Reline–GaCl3 50 mM at 20 mV s−1 at 60 °C. Arrows indicate the potential scan direction. 
From curve (b), the addition of 50 mM GaCl3 gives a prominent cathodic peak and two anodic waves in the CV. The cathodic process at −1.05 V is attributed to gallium deposition and is within the electrochemical stability range of the ionic liquid demonstrating that Ga can be electrodeposited on the Mo electrode without the interference of any electrolyte “decomposition reaction”, unlike in aqueous solution where the HER occurs during Ga deposition. On the reverse scan, two distinct anodic peaks are recorded, where the dominating wave at −0.2 V is associated with the complete bulk dissolution of gallium deposited on the forward scan. The smaller anodic peak centred at −0.65 V, as well as the shoulder at −0.1 V, cannot be clearly assigned, but are probably related to the stripping of Ga from different crystallographic orientations of the polycrystalline Mo surface.

Fig. 2 shows a set of scan rate dependence experiments measured at 60 °C. The CVs clearly show that the cathodic to anodic peak potential separation |Epc − Epa| increases and the cathodic peak potential shifts negatively with increasing potential scan rates. These results suggest that the electrodeposition of gallium on molybdenum is a quasi-reversible reaction. The inset of Fig. 2 clearly reveals a linear correlation between the cathodic peak current jpc and the square root of the scan rate, characteristic of a diffusion controlled process.

The effect of the temperature on the CV of Ga on Mo is illustrated in Fig. 3. By increasing the temperature from 25 °C to 90 °C, the electrochemical potential window of Reline decreases from 2.7 V to 2.2 V (Fig. 3a). At T ≤ 60 °C, only capacitive current is recorded in this potential range. However at T = 90 °C, a non-neglectable current is already observed at a potential positive to the bulk decomposition of Reline. The nature of this current is unknown, but it could be related to the adsorption/decomposition of IL solvation layers.27 The CV for Reline containing 50 mM GaCl3 (Fig. 3b) reveals that the deposition peak potential shifts positively, the cathodic to anodic peak potential separation |Epc − Epa| decreases and the peak current increases with higher temperature. The behaviour is correlated to the decreasing viscosity of ionic liquids with increasing temperature.28 Nucleation loops are observed at T ≤ 40 °C typical for nucleation processes where a large overpotential is required to form the deposit. At T ≥ 40 °C, these nucleation loops are no longer recorded, showing that lower overpotentials are required for bulk Ga deposition. El Abedin et al.29 have studied the additive free electrodeposition of Al on Au in the ionic liquid 1-butyl-1-methyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([BMP]Tf2N) and observed similar results; significant current loops were recorded for the bulk deposition of Al on Au at room temperature, whereas at 100 °C no nucleation loop was recorded.

3.2 Viscosity
The shear viscosities of the ionic liquid electrolytes have been measured and are summarised in Table 1. Under rotational tests with controlled shear rates from 1 to 1000 s−1, a constant value of the shear viscosity is observed for all the liquids, indicating Newtonian behaviour. The experimental viscosities of pure Reline at different temperatures are in agreement with the values reported by Abbott et al.21 Excellent agreement with the reported values is recorded at high temperature and satisfactory accordance is found at low temperature. This deviation at room temperature can be explained by the proximity to the freezing temperature of the liquid.21 It is also worth noting that the addition of 50 mM anhydrous CuCl2 and GaCl3 does not affect the viscosity, especially at T ≥ 40 °C. In this work we have chosen to work at 60 °C. At this temperature, Reline is not decomposed even after prolonged heating periods21 and the lower viscosity induces better mass transport properties.

3.3 Bulk electrodeposition of Ga on Mo

Electrodeposition of bulk gallium was realised by a constant potential electrolysis of a Reline–GaCl3 50 mM solution on a Mo rotating disk electrode (Mo RDE) at 300 rpm at 60 °C. The RDE is used as previous work30,31 has shown that the lateral homogeneity in composition and thickness of precursor layers for thin film semiconductors has significantly improved by controlling mass transport. The electrodeposition of homogeneous precursors is a necessary requirement for uniform properties of the finished photovoltaic device.

Fig. 4 displays typical SEM images, (a) top-view, (b) cross-section of Ga on Mo from Reline–GaCl3 50 mM deposited at an applied potential of −1.1 V for 30 min at 60 °C. At this temperature, metallic gallium is liquid (Tm = 29.8 °C) and it can be visually observed that a uniform, matte gray layer starts to grow on the Mo electrode after two minutes. SEM reveals that Ga is deposited as droplets on the Mo surface. The deposited Ga droplets show a very low affinity for the Mo surface, as no wetting of the surface is observed. The contact angle of the Ga droplets varies from 165° to 175°, depending on the droplet size (diam. 0.5–3 μm). This very low contact surface to volume ratio decreases the adhesion of the Ga deposits on the Mo surface. An average plating efficiency of 75% has been confirmed by ICP-MS; nevertheless this value is probably underestimated as the gallium deposit is easily washed off during the rinsing step after deposition. Time-dependence SEM measurements of depositions of 1, 5, 15 and 30 min have revealed that electrodeposition starts with the nucleation of small droplets. As these small liquid droplets grow, they appear to coalesce together to form larger droplets to reduce the surface tension. This growth mechanism is supported by the observed size distribution of the droplets and the free spaces surrounding the larger Ga droplets (Fig. 4a). Chen et al.18 have observed similar Ga droplet morphologies for the gallium electrodeposition from the Lewis acid AlCl3/1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid (60/40 mol%) on a tungsten wire at 30 °C. The authors postulated that the gallium droplets form only after the removal of the electrode from the hot solution. In our case, no specular reflexion is observed on the matte grey films, indicating that the deposit surface is not smooth.

          Cyclic voltammetry of Ga on Cu

Fig. 5 shows the CVs of a Cu electrode (Mo/Cu 200 nm) immersed in Reline–GaCl3 50 mM at 60 °C. The potential scan is started at the open circuit potential (OCP) and is swept in the negative direction. On the first scan, the cathodic current starts to flow at −0.7 V. The main peak centred at −0.9 V, assigned to the bulk deposition of Ga followed by a second deposition peak at −1.1 V. On the first scan, the pre-peak recorded at −0.7 V is related to the alloying of Ga with the Cu surface. The integrated charge (1.1 mC cm−2) of this shoulder suggests that no more than 2 to 3 monolayers of gallium are deposited. Gasparotto et al.19 have recently made a similar observation during the electrodeposition of Ga on Au from [BMP]Tf2N. A clear distinguishable alloy formation peak occurred on the first scan in the CV when Ga is deposited on the Au electrode.
 Fig. 5  First four scans of the cyclic voltammogram of a Mo/Cu in Reline–GaCl3 50 mM at 20 mV s−1 and 60 °C. 
On the reverse scan, no anodic Ga stripping peak is observed in the CV of Fig. 5, contrary to the case of the electrodeposition of Ga on Mo. Only a weak anodic current starts to show at −0.4 V. At E > −0.2 V, the anodic stripping of the Cu film is observed. The irreversible electrodeposition of Ga on Cu occurs at an overpotential less negative by 0.2 V than on Mo with lower peak currents. On the subsequent cycles, the first cathodic shoulder at −0.7 V disappears as a consequence of the surface alterations induced by alloying of deposited gallium with the copper electrode surface, which is not stripped off on the previous reverse scan. It is also worthwhile to mention that no electroless deposition of gallium on copper was observed in Reline even after prolonged immersion.
3.5 Bulk electrodeposition of Ga on Cu
Constant potential electrolysis of Ga on Cu was realised on Mo/Cu RDE substrates at 300 rpm in Reline–GaCl3 50 mM at −0.9 V and 60 °C. The Ga deposits are of shiny and reflective appearance, showing that a smooth Ga surface is formed on the Cu film, contrary to the matte Ga films formed on Mo. The plating efficiency was determined by means of ICP-MS and attained an average value above 85%. Fig. 6A shows a typical SEM image of the deposited Ga layer on Cu. The film presents very good adhesion to the underlying Cu film, contrary to the Ga deposits on Mo. Good wetting of the copper surface by Ga was observed and resulted in compact, homogeneous and adherent deposits. Fig. 6B shows the corresponding XRD diffractogram of the Ga electrodeposit on Mo/Cu after 15 minutes of deposition. The major peaks are the CuGa2 reflexions according to JCPDS-ICDD card 25-0275 and reveal Cu–Ga alloying during electrodeposition. The CuGa2 alloying is observed to be preferentially orientated with the (100) and (101) planes parallel to the substrate, compared to a randomly oriented crystal. The formation of the CuGa2 phase at 60 °C is in agreement with a calculated Cu–Ga phase diagram.32 The Cu (111) reflexion at 43.37° (JCPDS-ICDD card 04-0836) is weakly observed. XRD measurements realised one week after the electrodeposition of Ga on Cu held at room temperature in an inert atmosphere have not shown any further evolution with time. All XRD diffractograms are measured at room temperature which is close to the melting point of gallium (Tm = 29.78 °C) and therefore no gallium diffraction peaks are observable.

3.6 
          RDE
voltammetry of Cu–Ga on Mo

RDE studies of Reline–CuCl2 50 mM and Reline–GaCl3 50 mM have been performed in order to determine the diffusion coefficients of copper and gallium species. The corresponding RDE cyclic voltammograms are represented in Fig. 7A at rotation speeds ranging from 100 to 2500 rpm at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 at 60 °C. The cyclic voltammogram of (a) Reline–CuCl2 50 mM shows two distinct cathodic processes occurring during the forward scan. The sweep was started at the OCP (+0.5 V) and swept in the negative direction. At +0.4 V a typical S-shaped wave in the steady-state voltammogram appears and corresponds to the reversible reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+. This response is followed at −0.45 V by the further reduction to Cu0, resulting in the deposition of metallic copper. This second wave also presents the typical S-shape of RDE voltammetry at ω > 100 rpm. On the reverse scan, a current hysteresis related to the nucleation process is recorded and is followed by the complete anodic stripping of the Cu deposited on the forward scan. The difference in reduction potential between the Cu2+/Cu+ and Cu2+/Cu0 couple is in good agreement with the value of 0.88 V reported by Abbott et al.33

Fig. 7A(b) shows the corresponding CVs of the Mo RDE in Reline–GaCl3 50 mM with ω varying from 100 rpm to 2500 rpm at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 at 60 °C. The potential scan is started at +0.2 V (OCP) and swept in the negative direction. At −0.85 V a single prominent cathodic response is recorded and corresponds to the reduction of Ga3+ to Ga0 followed on the reverse scan by a large hysteresis and the characteristic anodic stripping peak of the deposited gallium. Contrary to the 50 mM CuCl2 solution, typical S-shaped cathodic waves are only observed at ω ≥ 600 rpm. At lower ω the voltammograms present peak shaped curves. Such anomalous behaviour in rotating disk voltammetry has already been reported in viscous ionic liquids. In order to obtain true steady-state voltammograms in viscous ionic liquids, low scan rates (5 to 10 mV s−1) and high rotation speeds (ω > 500 rpm) have to be employed.34–37 Boxall et al.36 have reported current maxima in rotating-ring disk electrode (RRDE) voltammetry for the ferrocene oxidation in [BMIm]PF6 on Pt. The authors pointed out that it is not trivial to obtain steady-state voltammograms in viscous ionic liquids and that low scan rates and high rotation speeds have to be employed. Similar behaviours have been reported in stationary voltammetry methods using (ultra)microelectrodes.37,38 In order to extract diffusion limiting currents, electrodes with small radius and very low scan rates have to be used to achieve spherical diffusion,39 moreover the influence of natural convection has to be taken into account.40,41

Fig. 7A reveals that steady-state voltammograms are obtained for both systems under the experimental conditions at high rotation speeds (ω > 600 rpm). The limiting currents are well expressed over a wide potential range and are analysed by the Levich equation in order to determine the diffusion coefficient of the reactants: il = 0.62nFAD2/30ω1/2ν−1/6C0,(1)where n is the number of transferred electrons, F is the Faraday constant (C mol−1), A is the electrode surface (cm2), D0 is the diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1), ω is the angular rotation speed (rad s−1), ν is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte (ratio of viscosity η to density ρ) (cm2 s−1) and C0 is the bulk concentration of the electroactive ion (mol cm−3). The density ρReline was determined and is 1.24 g cm−3 at 60 °C.

Fig. 7B shows the Levich plots of the limiting current density jlversus ω1/2 for the data extracted from the Ga and Cu cyclic voltammograms. For all the systems, jl varies linearly with ω1/2 and shows zero intercepts, indicating limiting diffusion control according to the Levich equation. From the experimental slope djl/dω1/2, the diffusion coefficients of the reacting ions were determined (Table 2). From the limiting current analysis of the reversible Cu2+/+ wave, a diffusion coefficient of 10.7 (±0.5) × 10−8 cm2 s−1 was determined, in agreement with D0 (Cu2+/0) within the experimental error.

Abbott et al.33 have measured the diffusion coefficient of Cu2+/+ in Reline using a stationary cyclic voltammetry at 20 °C. Taking into account the high viscosity of Reline at 20 °C (ηRel = 1072 mPa s)21,42 a Walden product D0·η = 14.4 × 10−8 g cm s−2 can be determined, in good agreement with our findings at 60 °C. Similarly, Tsuda et al.43 have recently reported the diffusion coefficient of Cu2+/+ in Reline–Cu2O and determined a Walden product D0·η = 13.6 × 10−8 g cm s−2 at 50 °C.
From the Levich analysis, the steady-state diffusion layer thickness can be calculated and is given by:44 δd = 1.61D1/30ν1/3ω−1/2.(2)The calculated values are tabulated in Table 2. The Levich analysis showed that the diffusion coefficient of gallium is lower than that of copper in Reline. This result correlates and explains the cathodic peak shape in the RDE voltammograms at low rotation speeds (Fig. 7A(b)), which is not observed in the case of the Cu deposition (Fig. 7A(a)). The ionic radii of Cu2+ and Ga3+ are 73 pm and 62 pm,45 respectively. The higher charge density of the gallium ions will result in a larger solvation shell in Reline. The smaller solvated copper ions are diffusing faster than the larger solvated gallium species in Reline, no depletion of copper species occurs at the electrochemical interface and thus no peak-shaped CVs are observed at low rotation speeds and low scan rates.

Fig. 8 shows the RDE voltammograms of Mo in Reline containing (a) 50 mM CuCl2, (b) 50 mM GaCl3 and (c) 50–50 mM CuCl2–GaCl3 at 2000 rpm, 5 mV s−1 at 60 °C. The onset of the limiting currents in the single-component ionic liquids (a) and (b) is −0.9 V and −0.6 V respectively. By comparing these values with the deposition potentials in the ionic liquid (c) containing CuCl2 and GaCl3 at the same concentrations, it can be observed that the potentials have shifted to more negative values by 0.2 V. This shift cannot be assigned to the silver pseudo-reference, as the reference potential is dominated by the constant chloride activity coming from the choline chloride/urea ionic liquid (ca. 5 M). Addition of 50 mM chloride salts does not significantly change the overall Cl− concentration and cannot account for this large potential shift. Moreover the stability of the reference potential is underlined by the invariability of the reversible Cu2+/+redox potential at +0.5 V (cf. curves (b) and (c)) before and after the addition of 50 mM gallium(III) chloride. The negative potential shift and slower current increase of the second limiting reduction plateau can be attributed to slow reaction kinetics related to high activation energy for the CuGa2 alloy formation at the electrode surface. Hence, a higher overpotential is requested to form this compound. On the reverse scan, the main anodic stripping potential is shifted to a more positive value and is characteristic for the dissolution of the stable gallium rich alloy formed during the cathodic scan.32 The shoulder recorded at −0.1 V is assigned to pure copper stripping. When switching the cathodic potential scan at −0.8 V, this peak is still recorded whereas the main alloy stripping peak at +0.2 V is absent.

3.7 Cu–Ga bulk codeposition
The RDE voltammetry study suggested that copper and gallium can be codeposited in Reline. Potentiostatic depositions are realised on a 2 × 2 cm2Mo RDE at 300 rpm from Reline CuCl2–GaCl3 for 30 minutes at 60 °C.

Fig. 9A shows the SEM images of thin films deposited on Mo from Reline CuCl2–GaCl3 25–50 mM at different potentials; (a) −0.7 V, (b) −0.9 V and (c) −1.1 V for 30 minutes at 60 °C. The corresponding XRD diffractograms are shown in Fig. 9B. The SEM image (a) shows circular shaped crystals with 200–300 nm diameter and EDX shows that the deposit is solely composed of metallic copper. XRD diffractogram (a) confirms these results; the peak at 43.37° corresponds to the Cu (111) phase, according to the JCPDS-ICDD card 04-0836. The SEM image (b) of the films deposited at −0.9 V has a different morphology. Needle like crystallites of 700 to 800 nm are randomly dispersed on the Mo surface. EDX analysis of the sample confirmed Ga incorporation at −0.9V and the diffractogram presents the characteristic peaks of CuGa2 alloy (JCPDS-ICDD card 25-0275). At −1.1 V a well-defined nanocrystalline structure consisting of needle-like crystals separated in clusters of 1.5–2 μm is observed and is homogeneously distributed over the whole substrate surface. EDX analysis shows that the chemical composition becomes more gallium rich with increasing overpotential (Table 3). As expected, electrodeposition at higher potentials in the limiting current plateau did not change the chemical composition of the thin films. Spot EDX measurements confirmed that the clusters are composed of Cu and Ga. XRD clearly revealed the bulk deposition of randomly orientated polycrystalline CuGa2 alloy at −1.1 V.

Careful observation of Fig. 9A(c) shows that some of the Cu is deposited as elemental Cu on the Mo surface. Under diffusion limiting conditions, the composition of the film is controlled by the ratio of the copper to gallium fluxes , with  according to Fick's first diffusion law. Previous works performed in aqueous solution5,46 have revealed similar results in the one step electrodeposition of CuInSe2. Electrochemical phase diagrams, showing the flux ratio of selenium and copper during codeposition as a function of the applied potential, have been established. Table 4 summarises the EDX analysis results of thin films codeposited on a Mo RDE (300 rpm) at −1.2 V for 30 minutes at 60 °C from Reline containing (1) 10–50 mM CuCl2–GaCl3, (2) 25–50 mM CuCl2–GaCl3 and (3) 50–50 mM CuCl2–GaCl3 and compares them to the calculated flux ratio. The stoichiometry of the Cu–Ga precursor films can be adjusted by choosing the composition of the codeposition bath and hence controlling the flux ratio. Near 1–1 stoichiometric Cu–Ga precursor films are formed from Reline containing 50 mM GaCl3 and 35 to 40 mM CuCl2. All the codeposited Cu–Ga films had a dull, brown coloured aspect. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) depth profiling of the codeposited precursor films, formed at different solution composition and applied potentials, showed no evidence of chloride, nitrogen and carbon in the deposits. These results indicate that no ionic liquid residues (or amounts below the detection limit of AES) were incorporated during electrodeposition. Moreover no bulk oxide compounds were detected, only a thin oxide surface layer was observed due to exposure to air.

          CuGaSe2 absorber layer and device formation
Cu–Ga precursors with controlled Cu/Ga ratios around 1 were converted to CuGaSe2 chalcopyrite semiconductors by thermal annealing in Se atmosphere at 550 °C. No significant loss of gallium is observed during the selenization of the codeposited Cu–Ga films,47 contrary to the case of Cu/Ga precursor stacks,11 where annealed CuGaSe2 films always revealed lower gallium content in comparison to the precursors, possibly due to the formation of volatile gallium selenides.
Biased photoelectrochemical measurements of the absorbers in an aqueous Eu3+ electrolyte showed that the selenized films were p-type semiconductors with a rapid response to chopped white light illumination.47Fig. 10 shows the (A) SEM cross-section and (B) XRD diffractogram of an annealed Cu–Ga precursor deposited in Reline containing 35–50 mM CuCl2–GaCl3 at −1.05 V for 30 minutes at 60 °C. The composition of the selenized film by EDX has been found to be Cu/Ga = 1.01 and Se/(Cu + Ga) = 0.95. XRD confirmed the single phase CuGaSe2 formation after annealing in accordance to JCPDS-ICDD card 01-4945. Preferential CuGaSe2 crystal orientation along the (112) axis is observed at 27.72° and the tetragonal splitting of the (220) and (204) peaks shows that the CuGaSe2 crystals are of good quality. Further experimental proof of the good CGS film quality was revealed by photoluminescence (PL) measurements where excitonic recombination has been observed.47PL excitons confirm the AES measurements, in the way that very small amounts of ionic liquid impurities are incorporated during codeposition and do not disturb the photoactivity of the CGS absorber layer. MoSe2 is formed during thermal annealing and is recorded at 32° by a broad peak and is confirmed by SEM observation. SEM images also show that the annealed films are dense and compact with a thickness of 2.8 μm.

Complete solar cell devices were realised. Fig. 11 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics curves in the dark and under illumination of the best performing device. The ZnO/CdS/CuGaSe2 solar cell achieved a 4.1% total area power conversion efficiency with VOC = 546 mV, JSC = 14.9 mA cm−2 and FF = 50.8% on a total area of 0.49 cm2 without any additional thermal treatment. Five devices have been finalised with good efficiency reproducibility ranging from 3.1% to 4.1% and underlines the good control of the film composition during the Cu–Ga codeposition. The previous best performing electrodeposited CuGaSe2 solar cell showed an 3.2% efficiency on a 0.09 cm2 active area and was formed by thermal selenization of Cu/Ga stacks, with Ga electroplated from a strong alkaline bath.11 For comparison, the world record polycrystalline CuGaSe2 solar cell with a total area efficiency of 9.5% (0.442 cm2) was grown by evaporation of elemental Cu, Ga and Se by physical vapour deposition (PVD).48 The 4.1% power conversion efficiency is very promising for low cost fabrication of wide band gap chalcopyrite absorber layers.

4. Conclusions
In this work we have demonstrated gallium and copper–gallium alloy electrodeposition from the choline chloride/urea ionic liquid for the fabrication of wide gap CuGaSe2 solar cells. It was shown that Ga electrodeposition is possible on Mo and Cu electrodes with high plating efficiency.
The one-step coelectrodeposition of Cu–Ga films from ionic liquids was reported for the first time. Significant to this work, compared to previous electrodeposition attempts of Ga are the precise control of the film stoichiometry over a large gallium composition range and the high current efficiency of the electrodeposition process in Reline. RDE studies allowed the determination of the diffusion coefficients of solvated Ga3+, Cu2+ in Reline. The conditions for steady-state voltammetry in ionic liquids have been discussed. The reported codeposition process allows the fabrication of metallic Cu–Ga precursor films that can be selenized to high quality CuGaSe2 absorbers without any significant Ga loss during the annealing step. Complete CuGaSe2 solar cells have been finalised and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 4.1%, which is a new record for electrodeposited–annealed CuGaSe2 solar cells.
These promising results show that the efficient and controlled electrodeposition–annealing of Ga containing thin films represents a novel route for low cost fabrication of thin film solar cells. Compared to conventional aqueous plating baths containing toxic and expensive complexing chemicals, Reline presents a non-hazardous, biodegradable, energetically and economically competitive electrolyte for future industrial large scale applications.
