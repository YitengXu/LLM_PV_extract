    , Accepted 9th December 2017First published on 11th December 2017AbstractThis paper reports a facile solvothermal method for the in situ growth of vertically aligned In2S3 nanosheet arrays (NSAs) on fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates. The as-synthesized two-dimensional graphene-like In2S3 nanosheets show an ultrathin thickness down to 3.7 nm consisting of the duodenary interplanar spacing of the (222) plane and a tunable bandgap varying from 2.32 to 2.58 eV. The film thickness and nanosheet density of the In2S3 NSAs can be adjusted by varying the reaction time and precursor concentration. The In2S3 NSAs with a higher film thickness exhibit relatively higher photocurrent due to their stronger light absorption as well as larger surface area for sufficient charge separation and redox reaction. The photoelectrochemical performance of the In2S3 photoanodes can be greatly enhanced by constructing an effective heterojunction with ZnO to promote the photocarrier separation. The In2S3/ZnO NSAs have demonstrated an optimal photocurrent density of 349.1 μA cm−2 at 1.2 V vs. RHE and a maximum incident photon to current efficiency of 10.26% at 380 nm, which are 13.5 and 38 times higher than those of the pristine In2S3 counterparts, respectively.
Introduction
As a clean, renewable and eco-friendly method to store solar energy, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is demonstrated to be one of the most efficient approaches for the production of hydrogen as a carbon-free fuel.1–3 Since the pioneering work of Fujishima and Honda,4 researchers have attempted to develop efficient photoanodes for PEC water splitting and thus producing hydrogen in the past forty years.5 The essential issue in realizing high energy conversion efficiency is to pursue and design suitable semiconductor photoanodes with sufficient light absorption, efficient charge separation and fast transport. Compared to the corresponding bulk materials, nanostructured semiconductors have great potential to meet all the aforesaid requirements due to their high surface areas.6–10
Among them, two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets have recently attracted considerable attention as attractive candidates for PEC water splitting owing to their unique mechanical, physical and chemical properties, as well as extremely large surface areas.11 Particularly, atomically thin 2D nanosheets show tunable bandgap characteristics depending on the thickness, which is beneficial for absorbing a large part of the solar spectrum.11,12 Moreover, the corresponding layered junction can shorten the charge transport time and distance, and promote the photocarrier separation, which then results in the improvement of PEC performance.13–15 To date, various 2D graphene-like layered crystals (e.g., MoS2, SnS2, CuInS2, WO3, and Cu2O) have been prepared as photoanode materials for PEC water splitting.13–18 However, the photoanodes were fabricated by coating the nanosheets onto conductive substrates such as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses. Thus, it is not easy to establish good ohmic contact between the conductive substrate and the deposited nanosheet-based film by the solution processed fabrication approach, which impedes the rapid transport of electrons and then increases the charge recombination.11 Additionally, the nanosheets can hardly refrain from agglomeration and re-stacking during the photoelectrode fabrication processes, resulting in a deceased effective area for photon capture and a hindered direct pathway for charge transfer and collection. Fortunately, nanoarray architectures in situ grown on conductive substrates have demonstrated to be highly efficient nanostructured photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting because of their intrinsic advantages of enhanced light trapping, decoupling light absorption and charge collection, shortening minority carrier diffusion, as well as an increased electrode/electrolyte interface for charge separation and interfacial redox reactions.19–23 Therefore, an ideal nanostructured film with vertically oriented nanosheet arrays (NSAs) showing good electrical contact with conductive substrates can avoid the abovementioned limitations and then exploit all the advantages of 2D nanosheets.
Among a variety of semiconductors, the widely studied metal chalcogenides have been reported to be a group of highly efficient catalysts for PEC water splitting.13–16 In particular, as an n-type III–VI group chalcogenide semiconductor with a relatively narrow bandgap of 2.0–2.3 eV, β-In2S3 has been proven to be a promising photoanode material under visible light irradiation due to its favourable energy band position, good conductivity, stable chemical composition and low toxicity.24–26 Until now, however, only a few researchers have reported the fabrication of various nanocrystals including nanosheets, nanoplates, nanoflakes and nanobelts as photoanodes for PEC water splitting.27–30 Although the 2D nanosheet architectures show outstanding properties, the PEC performance of pure In2S3 semiconductor nanocrystals for water oxidation is still far from satisfactory mainly due to the disadvantages of the solution processed fabrication approach of photoelectrodes. To exploit all the advantages of 2D nanosheets, however, it is urged to propose a method for the in situ growth of vertically aligned In2S3 NSAs on conductive substrates as photoanodes for highly efficient PEC water splitting.
Herein, we introduce the in situ growth of nanostructured β-In2S3 films composed of vertically oriented 2D ultrathin nanosheets on FTO substrates using a facile solvothermal method. The film thickness and nanosheet density can be controlled by varying the reaction time and precursor concentration. The PEC performance of the In2S3 NSAs with different film thicknesses has been investigated. To further enhance their PEC activity, a ZnO layer was deposited on the surfaces of In2S3 nanosheets by magnetron sputtering with the formation of a heterojunction to promote photogenerated carrier separation.
Experimental
Synthesis of In2S3 NSAs
As shown in Fig. S1,† In2S3 NSAs were grown on FTO glasses via a facile solvothermal process, in which indium chloride tetrahydrate (InCl3·4H2O), thioacetamide and ethylene glycol (EG) were used as the precursor of indium, the source of sulfur and the solvent for reaction, respectively. In a typical procedure, a cleaned FTO substrate was put into a Teflon autoclave angled against the vessel wall, facing down, and a 40 mL EG solution containing 24 mM InCl3·4H2O and 63 mM thioacetamide was poured into the autoclave. The autoclave was then transferred into an oven which was heated at 200 °C for 2 h and naturally cooled down to room temperature. The samples were washed with deionized water several times and then dried at 70 °C in air. In the experimental process, the reaction time and precursor concentration (keeping the ratio of In3+ and thioacetamide concentration constant) were changed to obtain In2S3 NSAs with different film thicknesses and nanosheet densities.
Fabrication of In2S3/ZnO heterojunction NSAs
In2S3/ZnO heterojunction NSAs were fabricated via depositing ZnO on the surfaces of In2S3 nanosheets by magnetron sputtering. The sputtering power, Ar gas flow and work pressure were 50 W, 25 sccm and 2.0 Pa, respectively. The sputtering time was adopted to vary the thickness of the as-grown ZnO layer.
Characterization
The micromorphology and microstructure of the nanostructured films were analysed on a Carl Zeiss Ultra 55 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a FEI Talos F200X transmission electron microscope (TEM), which were operated at 20 and 200 kV, respectively. A Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm) at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA was used to obtain X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in the diffraction angle range 2θ = 20–80°. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained using a Kratos Axis UltraDLD spectrometer with a monochromatic Al Kα source. The optical properties were characterized by using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) decay curves were obtained on a steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectrofluorometer (QM/TM/IM, PTI, USA) at room temperature under the excitation at 350 nm and probed at 420 nm. The crystal structure of In2S3 was drawn by the Diamond software.
PEC measurements
For easy measurement, a sample was firstly fixed on a glass slide, which then connected with an enamelled Cu wire using conductive silver paint. To prevent photocurrent leakage, the electroconductive parts of the sample were isolated with epoxy resin keeping the light absorption area of ∼1.0 cm (Fig. S2†). The PEC test system includes a Shanghai Chenhua CHI 650E electrochemical working station and a Beijing Perfectlight CHF-XM500 solar simulator equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp and an AM 1.5G filter. A three-electrode cell containing 1.0 M KCl aqueous solution (pH = 5.97) was used to characterize the PEC properties, in which the sample, Pt mesh and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode are the working electrode (WE), counter electrode (CE) and reference electrode (RE), respectively.
The measured potentials versus Ag/AgCl RE were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale via the Nernst equation: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + E0(1)where ERHE, EAg/AgCl and E0 are the converted potential versus RHE, the experimental potential measured against the Ag/AgCl RE and the standard potential of Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) at 25 °C (i.e., 0.197), respectively.
The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE under monochromatic irradiation from a xenon lamp equipped with bandpass filters. It is expressed as: IPCE = (1240I)/(λPlight)(2)where I, λ and Plight are the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), the incident light wavelength (nm) and the power density of monochromatic light at a specific wavelength (mW cm−2), respectively.
The photoconversion efficiency (η) was calculated with the following equation: η = I(1.23 − VRHE)/Pin(3)where I, VRHE (V vs. RHE) and Pin are the photocurrent density, bias voltage and incoming light flux (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), respectively.11
The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained under AM 1.5G illumination with a sinusoidal perturbation with 5 mV amplitude and frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. Mott–Schottky plots were obtained in the dark at a frequency of 1 kHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV.
Results and discussion
After a solvothermal reaction for more than 1 h, a yellow film was grown on the FTO conductive glass without any post-treatment (Fig. S1†), indicating the in situ formation of In2S3 NSAs. As shown in Fig. 1, the In2S3 films at various reaction times are constructed from vertically oriented and interconnected nanosheets. Additionally, both the nanosheet size and the film thickness increase with prolonged reaction time. For example, the In2S3 NSAs grown for 1 h show an average nanosheet size of 430 nm (Fig. 1a2) and a film thickness of 0.29 μm (Fig. 1a3), whereas those for the In2S3 prepared in 4 h are 980 nm and 1.41 μm (Fig. 1c2 and c3), respectively. It should be noted that the nanosheet size was defined as the distance of two adjacent intersections according to the top-view SEM images for illustrating the size difference of the samples. However, no apparent change in the nanosheet size and film thickness for In2S3 NSAs can be observed on further increasing the growth time (Fig. 1d1–d3).
 Fig. 1  SEM images of In2S3 NSAs with varied reaction times: (a1–a3) 1 h, (b1–b3) 2 h, (c1–c3) 4 h and (d1–d3) 8 h. 
The XRD patterns of the In2S3 NSAs grown at varied reaction times are shown in Fig. 2a. Apart from the diffraction peaks of FTO substrates, two weak peaks can be observed at 27.5 and 47.9°, which can be indexed to the (311) and (−440) crystal planes of cubic β-In2S3 (JCPDS no. 32-0456), respectively.27,30 The typical energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) of the as-grown In2S3 films (Fig. 2b) suggests that the atomic ratio of S and In elements is about 1.6 which is close to the stoichiometric ratio of In2S3 (S/In = 1.5). Furthermore, XPS was conducted to further confirm the composition and valence states of the In2S3 NSAs.31 The In 3d core peaks appearing at 3d3/2 (452.5 eV) and 3d5/2 (444.9 eV) are consistent with the valence state of +3 in In2S3. The S 2p core can be obviously split into two peaks at 162.5 and 161.4 eV corresponding to the S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 in In2S3, respectively.

As shown in Fig. 3, the micromorphology and microstructure of the In2S3 nanosheets were further characterized by TEM. It can be seen that the In2S3 nanosheets connect with each other and exhibit an ultrathin thickness of several nanometres (Fig. 3a). The typical high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the In2S3 nanosheets shown in Fig. 3b indicates that they are composed of a lot of nanocrystal grains, which is further proved by the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 3c). The fringe spacing of 0.31 nm in the HRTEM image for the cross-section of In2S3 nanosheets (Fig. 3d) is consistent with the interplanar spacing of the (222) planes. It can be inferred that the ultrathin In2S3 nanosheets possess the preferentially exposed (222) facet, which matches well with the XRD results because the {222} planes are perpendicular to the {−440} planes for the cubic In2S3. Based on the above structural characterization, a crystal structure model of cubic β-In2S3 can be established, as illustrated in Fig. 3e. It can be seen that the In2S3 belongs to a layered structure with alternated S and In layers along the [222] direction, and the In atoms locate in the centre of the octahedral cages formed by six adjacent S atoms. Therefore, the ultrathin thickness of 3.7 nm for the In2S3 nanosheets (Fig. 3a) corresponds to the duodenary interplanar spacing of the (222) planes.

The influence of the precursor concentration on the growth of In2S3 NSAs has also been investigated. The optical image (Fig. S1b†) and XRD patterns (Fig. S3†) of the samples prepared with different In3+ concentrations indicate that the In2S3 film can uniformly grow on FTO substrates at various precursor concentrations. The corresponding SEM images shown in Fig. 4 suggest that the In3+ concentration has a little influence on the formation of a 2D graphene-like morphology for the In2S3 nanosheets. Whereas, both the nanosheet density and film thickness increase with enhanced precursor concentration for the growth of In2S3 NSAs.

To characterize the light absorption ability of the In2S3 NSAs, the light transmittance and reflectance spectra of the samples were recorded over a wide wavelength range of 250–850 nm. Fig. 5a–c show the light transmittance, reflectance and absorption spectra of the samples obtained at various reaction times. The In2S3 NSAs show a relatively stronger light absorption ability in the short wavelength region. Moreover, the In2S3 NSAs grown for a longer reaction time demonstrate better light absorption, which can be attributed to their nanoarray structure with a larger film thickness for photon capture. The In2S3 NSAs prepared with 4 h reaction time show an optimal light absorbance of 93.1% at 376 nm. Due to its large exciton Bohr diameter (33.8 nm), In2S3 is reported to be a semiconductor material well-suited for the fundamental research of the quantum confinement effect, which provides a convenient way to adjust the bandgap.30,32 Here the one-dimensional quantum confinement effect for the ultrathin In2S3 nanosheets is proved because a significant blue-shifted absorption band edge can be seen in comparison with bulk In2S3 (Fig. 5c). As shown in Fig. 5d, the In2S3 NSAs prepared at different reaction times exhibit a bandgap between 2.39 and 2.58 eV, which is much larger than that of the corresponding bulk material (2.0–2.3 eV).33 Furthermore, the bandgap of In2S3 nanosheets decreases with increasing reaction time due to the increased nanosheet thickness in the growth processes.24 In addition, the optical properties of the In2S3 NSAs obtained with varied In3+ concentrations were also characterized as shown in Fig. S4.† It is revealed that their bandgaps are in the range of 2.32–2.45 eV and the In2S3 NSAs grown at higher precursor concentration show a relatively higher absorptance and narrower bandgap.

The PEC properties of the photoanodes based on In2S3 NSAs were investigated using a three-electrode configuration in a 1.0 M KCl solution. Fig. 6a displays the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves under chopped AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated solar illumination for the In2S3 NSAs prepared at different reaction times. It can be observed that all samples exhibit an obvious photocurrent under light illumination, suggesting the efficient charge generation and separation at the semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces. Besides, the absolute photocurrent increases with increasing bias potential, which demonstrates the n-type semiconductor characteristics of the as-prepared In2S3 NSAs. Additionally, the nanoarray-structured In2S3 film prepared at a longer reaction time demonstrates relatively higher PEC performance because the higher film thickness is in favour of increased photon capture for generating more carriers as well as a large surface area for sufficient charge separation and interfacial redox reactions.19 The photocurrent density at 1.2 V vs. RHE for the In2S3 NSAs grown for 1, 2 and 4 h is 19.7, 25.8 and 35.7 μA cm−2, respectively. Because increasing the reaction time longer than 4 h will not promote the further growth of In2S3 NSAs, the 8 h sample shows nearly the same PEC performance as the 4 h one. Fig. 6b illustrates the amperometric I–t curves of the corresponding samples at 1.23 V vs. RHE under chopped illumination. The photocurrent of In2S3 NSAs exhibits a prompt rise under each illumination, and quickly drops when the light is switched off, demonstrating the excellent switching behaviour and good stability of the photoanodes. The photocurrent overshoots in the beginning of illumination should be attributed to the photocarrier accumulation at the nanosheet/electrolyte interfaces.34

It is well known that an effective way for improving the PEC performance of a photoelectrode is to engineer a heterojunction, which can promote charge separation and transfer and then reduce the recombination of unstable photogenerated electron–hole pairs.35–37 As an efficient and stable photoanode material, ZnO was deposited on the surfaces of In2S3 NSAs by the magnetron sputtering method to further enhance their PEC properties. As a representative of pristine NSAs, the sample of In2S3-2 h was chosen to illustrate the enhanced PEC performance. The sputtering time was adopted to adjust the ZnO thickness (growth rate: 3.5 nm min−1). For the sample of In2S3/ZnO-x min NSAs, x is the deposition time of ZnO. The XRD pattern of In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSAs compared to those of the FTO substrate and pristine In2S3 NSAs proves the successful growth of ZnO on In2S3 nanosheets (Fig. S5†).
TEM was used to characterize the microtopography, microstructure and component of In2S3/ZnO-10 min NSAs as shown in Fig. 7. It can be obviously observed that the nanosheets become rough after the deposition of ZnO (Fig. 7a). The high-magnification (Fig. 7b) and bright-field (Fig. 7c) TEM images demonstrate the decoration of ZnO nanoparticles on the prepared In2S3 nanosheets. The HRTEM image of the ZnO (inset, Fig. 7b) exhibits its lattice spacing of ∼0.29 nm corresponding to the interplanar distance of the (100) crystal plane of hexagonal ZnO, which is consistent with the analysis of the corresponding SAED pattern (inset, Fig. 7a). The elemental mapping for a part of a composite nanosheet shown in Fig. 7d–g further confirms the relatively uniform distribution of ZnO on In2S3. As shown in the SEM images of In2S3/ZnO-x min NSAs (Fig. 8a–f), the thickness of the ZnO layer increases with increasing deposition time.

Additionally, we have investigated the influence of the ZnO layer on the optical properties of In2S3/ZnO-x min NSAs as shown in Fig. 8g–i. The transmission spectra indicate that in the whole UV-vis-NIR region the transmittance of In2S3/ZnO NSAs first decreases with increasing deposition time and then reaches a peak at 100 min (Fig. 8g) due to the increased film thickness for light absorption. The reflection spectra in Fig. 8h show that in the short wavelength region the ZnO layer with a relatively thinner thickness can suppress the reflection of In2S3/ZnO NSAs, but a thicker layer will result in increased reflectance probably ascribing to the destruction of the nanoarray morphology (insets, Fig. 8a–f). In the long wavelength region, however, the reflectance keeps increasing continuously with the increasing thickness of ZnO, resulting in a relatively poor light absorption enhancement in this region as illustrated in Fig. 8i. The results prove that the ZnO layer can improve the light absorption of In2S3/ZnO NSAs especially in the short wavelength region due to its relatively large bandgap (3.26 eV, see Fig. S6†), whereas a thicker layer will destroy the nanoarray morphology, which is not beneficial for light trapping.
As shown in Fig. 9a, the In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSA photoanode exhibits tremendously elevated PEC activity compared to the pristine In2S3-2 h NSA and ZnO film (ZnO-100 min) counterparts. It shows an absolute photocurrent of 349.1 μA cm−2 at 1.2 V vs. RHE, which is 13.5 and 12.5 times higher than those of the In2S3-2 h NSAs and ZnO-100 min film (Fig. S7†), respectively. Additionally, the LSV curves of the In2S3/ZnO NSAs with different ZnO thicknesses were obtained as shown in Fig. S8,† and the corresponding photocurrent densities at 1.2 V vs. RHE are presented in Fig. 9b. The results suggest that the photocurrent of In2S3/ZnO-x min NSAs first increases with the prolonged deposition time of ZnO, and achieves a maximum value at 100 min. Further increasing the deposition time to 150 min, however, will result in a decreased photocurrent density. The reason can be attributed to the decreased absorptance (Fig. 8i) and decreased surface area for charge separation and interfacial redox reactions. On the other hand, a thick ZnO layer will also boost the odds of recombination for photogenerated carriers.15,38 The photoconversion efficiency of the In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSAs compared to those of the pristine In2S3-2 h NSAs and ZnO-100 min film was calculated from the LSV curves (Fig. 9a) as shown in Fig. 9c. It can be observed that the In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSAs demonstrate much higher efficiency than the two counterparts. The optimal conversion efficiency of the In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSAs is 0.064%, which is 5.3 and 20.0 times larger than those of the In2S3-2 h NSAs (0.012%) and ZnO-100 min film (0.0032%), respectively. Fig. 9d shows the IPCE spectra at 1.23 V vs. RHE for the In2S3-2 h NSAs, ZnO-100 min film and In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSAs. It is obvious that the In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSAs exhibit a remarkably enhanced efficiency especially in the short wavelength region, which can be ascribed to the relatively wide bandgap for both In2S3 and ZnO. The In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSA photoanode demonstrates a maximum IPCE of 10.26% at 380 nm, which is 38.0 and 7.1 times higher than those of the pristine In2S3 NSAs (0.27%) and ZnO film (1.44%), respectively. The result further indicates that the contribution to the greatly enhanced PEC performance for the In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSAs mainly comes from the formed In2S3/ZnO heterojunction because the light absorption enhancement is nearly zero at 380 nm (see Fig. S9†).

The EIS spectra of the In2S3-2 h NSAs, ZnO-100 min film and In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSA photoanodes under AM 1.5G illumination were recorded to further investigate the reason for the dramatically increased PEC performance (Fig. 9e). The corresponding equivalent circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. 9e, and the fitting results are listed in Table S1.†39 It is well known that the diameter of the semicircle at high frequencies in a Nyquist plot means the charge transfer resistance (Rct), which controls the electron transfer kinetics at the interface between the photoelectrode and electrolyte.40,41 The results suggest that the Rct of the In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSAs (5.96 kΩ cm2) under illumination is much smaller than those of the bare In2S3-2 h NSAs (15.95 kΩ cm2) and ZnO-100 min film (224.44 kΩ cm2) photoanodes. This manifests that the deposited ZnO layer can facilitate electron transfer from the nanostructured photoanode to the electrolyte due to the formation of a heterojunction, which then gives rise to the elevated photocurrent. Additionally, the ZnO modified In2S3 NSAs exhibit an increased PL lifetime (0.91 ns) compared to the bare In2S3 sample (0.57 ns), further confirming that the deposition of ZnO on In2S3 can effectively suppress the charge recombination and increase the lifetime of charge carriers for enhanced separation efficiency (Fig. S10†).42,43
The Mott–Schottky plots of In2S3-2 h NSAs, ZnO-100 min film and In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSAs are presented in Fig. 9f, in which 1/C2 is plotted against the potential (V). The positive slope of the plots confirms the n-type semiconductor property of both In2S3 and ZnO as photoanode materials. The flat-band potential (EFB) can be estimated from the extrapolation of the linear region as shown in Fig. 9f.44 The EFB values of In2S3, ZnO and In2S3/ZnO are −0.29, 0.16 and −0.23 V, respectively. It is consistent with the result that the samples of In2S3-2 h and In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSAs nearly have the same onset potential, which is more negative than that of the ZnO-100 min film (Fig. 9a). Furthermore, the carrier density (Nd) of the In2S3-2 h NSAs and ZnO-100 min film can be estimated according to the slopes determined from the Mott–Schottky plots using the following equation: Nd = (2/eε0ε)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1(4)where e is the electron charge, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum (ε0 = 8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1), and ε is the material's dielectric constant (8.4 and 8.5 for In2S3 and ZnO, respectively).24,45 As a result, the electron concentrations in the In2S3 NSAs and ZnO film are 4.37 × 1020 and 7.16 × 1019 cm−3, respectively.
Based on the measured flat-band potential, electron concentration and energy of the bandgap, the schematic diagram of the energy band structure for In2S3 and ZnO before and after coming into contact can be drawn as illustrated in Fig. 10. The Fermi level (EF) of In2S3 is higher than that of ZnO due to its more negative flat-band potential, but the energy difference between the conduction band minimum (ECBM) and EF in ZnO is much larger than that of In2S3 because of its relatively lower carrier concentration.45 As the two semiconductors come into contact with each other to form an n/n heterojunction, the electrons in the EF of In2S3 thus migrate to the that of ZnO until they have an equivalent EF, which would make the valence band maximum (EVBM) of ZnO slightly higher than that of In2S3. Consequently, under illumination, the photogenerated electrons can easily transfer from the ECBM of ZnO to that of In2S3, and the formed photogenerated holes in the EVBM of In2S3 transport to that of ZnO and then to the electrolyte for water oxidation.

The photocurrent stability of the photoanodes was evaluated by chronoamperometric measurements at 1.23 V vs. RHE under chopped illumination over 400 s as shown in Fig. S11.† Although the In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSAs demonstrate much higher photocurrent density than the bare In2S3 counterparts, they exhibit relatively poor photocurrent stability. The photocurrent decreases from the initial value of 287.2 to 86.5 μA cm−2 after the stability test. Whereas, the individual In2S3 NSAs and ZnO film based photoanodes show good stability in this short-time test (Fig. S7c and S11†). The poor photocurrent stability of the In2S3/ZnO-100 min NSAs can be attributed to the non-conformal deposition of the ZnO layer (insets, Fig. 8a–f) as it leads to a relatively poor heterojunction interface. The construction of a conformal ZnO layer on In2S3 NSAs by other methods such as atomic layer deposition has the potential to improve the photocurrent stability of the In2S3/ZnO NSA-based photoanodes, which needs further investigation in the future work.
Conclusions
In summary, we have proposed a facile solvothermal method to realize the controllable growth of vertically aligned In2S3 NSAs. The preparation parameters reaction time and precursor concentration have been demonstrated to control the film thickness and nanosheet density of the as-synthesized In2S3 NSAs, which exhibit a varied light absorption ability and a tunable bandgap. The PEC tests suggest that the nanostructured In2S3 films with a higher thickness exhibit relatively higher PEC activity due to the enhanced light absorption as well as the large surface area for sufficient charge separation and redox reaction. Furthermore, a ZnO layer has been deposited onto the surfaces of In2S3 NSAs to form an efficient heterojunction for charge separation, which results in greatly enhanced PEC performance. It is believed that the strategy reported in this paper provides a facile route to design and fabricate high performance photoelectrodes based on 2D nanoarray metal chalcogenides.
