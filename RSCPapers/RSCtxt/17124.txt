    , Accepted 30th October 2015First published on 2nd November 2015AbstractHerein, we present fully printable carbon electrode based perovskite solar cells using highly crystalline NiO nanosheets as top hole transport layers, mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles as a bottom electron transport layer and ZrO2 as an intermediate spacer layer, respectively. Time-resolved photoluminescence decay measurements, electron impedance spectroscopy and transient photovoltage decay measurements have revealed that the NiO nanosheets as top hole transporters exhibit superior charge collection efficiency and a prolonged charge lifetime. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.2% is achieved under standard testing conditions.
Introduction
Solution-processable organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite materials, such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), have shown great promise for low-cost thin film solar cells. During the last three years, extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient fabrication technologies with energy conversion efficiency over 20% being achieved recently1 due to the strong light absorption, suitable direct optical band gap, weak exciton binding energy, large electron and hole mobility, and long electron diffusion length of perovskites.2–5 However, the state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells require organic hole transport materials and noble metals for proper operation.6 For example, the top charge transport layers used in PVSCs are usually organic materials, such as PCBM and spiro-OMeTAD,7,8 which possess several unfavourable properties, such as poor crystallinity, low mobility, possible degradation and high cost. Recently, inorganic materials such as CuSCN9–12 and CuI13 have been used successfully as hole selective materials; however, the overall performance of the resulting devices is poor.6
Nickel oxide (NiO)7,11,14–18 has been used as a hole transporter in PVSCs successfully. Like several other nanostructured oxide materials including nanorods,19 nanofibers20 and core–shell structures,21 and nanowires,22 nickel oxide can efficiently enhance charge extraction and prolong the charge lifetime.23,24 More importantly, NiO exhibits much better thermal and chemical stability than spiro-OMeTAD, which is favourable to the long stability of PVSCs.26,27 In contrast to spiro-OMeTAD that requires multi-step organic synthesis and tedious purification,25,26 NiO is abundant and can be prepared by simple and low-cost synthetic processes. When combined with other carbon materials, such as carbon/graphite composites,28–31 carbon nanotubes,32,33 graphene,34 carbon ink,35 and commercial carbon paste,36,37 the resulting devices offer great potential for fully printable and cost-effective devices without using expensive Au and Ag.33,34 Unfortunately, the photovoltaic performance of fabricated devices is inferior to that of state-of-the-art devices and significant improvement is needed.
Our previous study showed that NiO nanoparticles improved the charge collection efficiency compared to ZrO2 nanoparticles in carbon/graphite counter electrode-based PVSCs.23 In these devices, NiO nanoparticles were deposited directly on the top of the TiO2 nanoparticle layer, which could cause anomalous recombination leading to poor energy conversion efficiency.24 We reported here a new strategy to address this concern. We applied highly crystalline NiO nanosheets as top nanostructured charge transport layers by inserting an additional ZrO2 layer between the TiO2 layer and the NiO layer. The resulting films exhibit superior charge collection efficiency and a prolonged charge lifetime. The resulting devices exhibit an impressive energy conversion efficiency of 14.2% under AM 1.5G conditions.
Experimental
Synthesis of NiO nanosheets
First, 0.582 g nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in 100 mL distilled water, and then transferred into a three-necked flask. Then, an aqueous solution (50 mL) of 4 mM oxalic acid dihydrate and 20 mM hexamethylenetetramine was added dropwise under stirring for 30 min. The resulting mixture was heated to 100 °C and refluxed for 6 hours. The green precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with water and ethanol three times. After drying at 60 °C in a vacuum chamber for 12 h, the green product was heated in a muffle furnace in air at 400 °C for 2 hours to give a fine grey NiO nanosheet powder. The screen printing NiO nanosheet paste was prepared by mixing ethyl cellulose solution in ethanol (44 wt%), terpineol (46 wt%) and NiO nanosheet powder (10 wt%), followed by ultrasonication and vigorous stirring. After being well dispersed, ethanol was removed by rotary evaporation.
Device fabrication
The devices were fabricated as we described previously.23 FTO conducting glass was etched with a sander to form two detached electrode patterns before being ultrasonically cleaned with detergent solution, deionized water and ethanol successively. A compact TiO2 layer was deposited on the cleaned FTO glass by spray pyrolysis deposition with di-isopropoxytitanium bis(acetyl acetonate) solution at 450 °C. The films were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min and then cooled to room temperature. A 450 nm mesoporous TiO2 (DSL. 18NR-T, 20 nm, Dyesol, Australia, diluted at a 1/3.5 mass ratio of paste/terpineol) layer, a 400 nm ZrO2 spacer layer, a 1 μm NiO layer and a 8 μm carbon black/graphite layer were subsequently prepared by screen printing onto the FTO conducting glass layer by layer, which were sintered at 500 °C, 500 °C, 500 °C and 400 °C for 30 min, respectively. The obtained films were then infiltrated with PbI2 by dropping a PbI2 solution in DMF (462 mg mL−1) that was maintained at 70 °C. After drying, the films were dipped into 2-propanol for 1–2 s before being dipped in a solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg mL−1) for 10 min and then rinsed with 2-propanol. The films changed colour from light yellow to black during the dipping process, indicating the formation of the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3. After annealing at 70 °C for 30 min, the fabrication of the device was finished. All the procedures above were completed in a dry air atmosphere.
Characterization
The crystal phases of NiO nanosheets were identified by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO, Cu Kα radiation, PANalytical B. V.). The morphology of NiO nanosheets was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 20, FEI). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis was used to determine the surface area and the pore size distribution, on an ASAP 2020 accelerated surface area and a porosimetry analyzer. The thickness of the mesoscopic layer was confirmed by using a commercial profiler (DEKTAK 150, VECCO, Bruker).
A xenon light source solar simulator (450 W, Oriel, model 9119) with an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, model 91192) was used to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of the solar cells. The current–voltage characteristics of the devices under these conditions were obtained by applying an external potential bias to the devices and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. A similar data acquisition system was used to control the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement. The devices (∼0.6 cm2) were tested using a metal mask to prevent the scattering of light.
Electron impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out on a Zennium electrochemical workstation (Zahner 6.0, Germany) in the frequency range from 100 mHz to 1 MHz at 10 mV AC amplitude under the LED simulated light. The electron lifetime was determined by transient photovoltage decay measurements. An array of diodes was used to produce a white light bias and blue-light diodes controlled by a fast solid-state switch to generate a pulse (0.05 s square pulse-width, 100 ns rise and fall time). The voltage dynamics were recorded on a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix MDO3032). By varying the intensity of the white-light bias, the recombination rate constant and the electron diffusion rate constant could be estimated over a range of applied biases.
Results and discussion
The NiO nanosheets were characterized by TEM and XRD, as shown in Fig. 1. The NiO nanosheets exhibit a hierarchical structure of a porous flower with a diameter of ∼1.5 μm as shown in Fig. 1a–c. It can be seen from Fig. 1d that the peak positions appearing at 2θ = 37.14°, 43.29°, 62.80°, 75.38°, 79.31° can be indexed to (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) crystal planes of the NiO, respectively, indicating that the as-synthesized NiO nanosheets are cubic NiO. The NiO lattice constant calculated from the XRD data is 4.2164 Å, which is in good agreement with the reported data.38,39

Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements were performed to evaluate the charge transfer at the CH3NH3PbI3/NiO nanosheet (NiO-NS) interface. The result is shown Fig. 2. For comparison purposes, the samples of CH3NH3PbI3/NiO nanoparticles (NiO-NP) and CH3NH3PbI3/ZrO2 nanoparticles (ZrO2-NP) are also measured and presented in Fig. 2. The normalized TRPL decay shows that both CH3NH3PbI3/NiO-NP and CH3NH3PbI3/NiO-NS samples exhibit faster quenching relative to the CH3NH3PbI3/ZrO2 sample, indicating a fast charge transfer from CH3NH3PbI3 to NiO after photon excitation.40 Moreover, the NiO NS exhibits a PL lifetime (τe) of 2.4 ns, which is shorter than the PL lifetime of NiO NP (5.1 ns), indicating that the nanosheet could be acting as a more effective hole collector in comparison to nanoparticles. This result could be caused by the efficient interfacial contact between CH3NH3PbI3 and NiO NS.38,41,42

Fig. 3a shows the schematic of a typical carbon counter electrode based PVSC device using NiO nanosheets as top hole collectors. In such devices, compact TiO2 nanoparticles, mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticles, ZrO2 nanoparticles, NiO nanosheets and carbon/graphite are used as a hole blocking layer, a bottom electron transport layer, an intermediate insulation layer, a top hole transport layer and a counter electrode, respectively. Fig. 3b shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the interfacial junction structure of active layers in the device. The CH3NH3PbI3, fully infiltrated inside of TiO2, ZrO2 and NiO layers, injects electrons into the conduction band of TiO2,8 and holes into the valence band of NiO,16,40 respectively. Both electron and hole transfer occur inside the ZrO2 layer due to its large electron and hole mobility and conductivity.3,43–45 Furthermore, the ZrO2 layer is believed to separate the TiO2 layer and the NiO layer to suppress interfacial charge recombination.24 The CH3NH3PbI3 light absorption material was deposited by a two-step deposition method inside of the entire mesoporous layers with uniform distribution. This was confirmed by the EDX spectra shown in Fig. S1.† Compared to the NiO nanoparticle, it is difficult to prepare very thin films without losing continuity of the film. Therefore, the thickness of the NiO nanosheet layer was set to 1 μm in this study, which was also the limit we could achieve in the laboratory. To ensure that the comparison is meaningful, NiO nanoparticles with the same thickness (1 μm) were used to exclude the thickness effects on photovoltaic performance. In this way, other effects including pore filling, crystallinity and interface on charge collection and charge recombination will be easily clarified. It's also worth noting that the 1 μm film thickness is not the optimized thickness for the NiO nanoparticle based device.

Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the NiO-NP based and NiO-NS based PVSC devices measured under simulated AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2). The histogram of power conversion efficiency is shown in Fig. S2.† As shown in Table 1, the NiO-NP based PVSC exhibited the highest PCE of 12.4% with a JSC of 19.5 mA cm−2. The NiO-NS based PVSC device exhibits an increased PCE of 14.2% with a JSC of 20.4 mA cm−2 and a VOC of 965 mV. Fig. 4b shows the IPCE spectra of the devices in the range from 300 nm to 850 nm. The NiO-NS device exhibits a higher IPCE value than that of the NiO-NP device. An effective charge collection property of NiO-NS is believed to contribute significantly to the increased voltage and current in NiO-NS based devices than that with a NiO-NP layer. An anomalous hysteresis often has been observed in perovskite solar cells with different device architecture.46,47 As shown in Fig. 5a, we also compared the forward bias to short circuit (FB-SC) and short-circuit to forward bias (SC-FB) J–V curves of NiO nanosheet solar cells. Negligible hysteresis was observed in such devices, which is ascribed to effective charge extraction from CH3NH3PbI3 to oxide nanomaterials when considering the device architecture.48,49 The steady-state power output at a forward bias of 0.7 V as a function of time was carried out to understand the stabilized power output under working conditions.46 As shown in Fig. 5b, the photocurrent density stabilizes within seconds to approximately 20.0 mA cm−2, yielding stabilized power conversion efficiency around 13.9% measured after 100 s. This indicates that the test conditions provide an accurate representation of the device photovoltaic performance (Table 1).

EIS measurements were conducted to investigate the internal properties of PVSCs. Fig. 6 shows the Nyquist plots of devices using NiO-NP or NiO-NS under illumination at a bias of 0.7 V. The Nyquist plots of the devices show three main features: (i) an arc in the high frequency region attributed to the charge exchange process at the counter electrode interface, (ii) an arc in the middle frequency region attributed to the charge recombination process at the perovskite/NiO interface, (iii) an arc in the low frequency region that represents a slow process correlated to ionic motion in perovskite.50–52 Here, we used a three lumped RC-circuit in series as shown in Fig. 6 (inset) to fit the impedance data. Since the NiO-NS and NiO-NP devices contain the same TiO2/perovskite interface, the difference in the medium frequency region is dominated by the perovskite/NiO interface.

The solid lines are the fitted curves. Inset: the equivalent circuit for fitting the EIS data. 
The Rct1 and τe1 obtained from EIS at different biases are shown in Fig. 7 and the corresponding capacitance C1 are shown in Fig. S3.†Fig. 7a indicates that the NiO-NS device exhibits a relatively larger charge recombination resistance (Rct1) than that of the NiO-NP device. Fig. 7b shows the calculated lifetime τe1 (τe1 = Rct1C1) as a function of the applied bias24,50,53 under different biases for NS and NP-based cells. NS-based devices exhibit longer electron lifetimes than that of NS-based cells signifying that the NiO-NS device also has a longer charge recombination lifetime. These results imply that the highly crystalline NiO nanosheets have less surface defects, which reduce the charge recombination probability.42

Fig. 8a presents the low frequency resistance obtained from impedance measurements. The corresponding time constant τe2 calculated from Rct2 and C2 within a hundred to thousand millisecond time scale is shown in Fig. 8b, corresponding to ion motion in the perovskite.51,56–58 The small differences in τe2 for the two devices imply that the observation of device photovoltaic performance is not related to this element. Transient photovoltage decay measurements were carried out to determine the interfacial charge recombination of the two devices. As shown in Fig. S4,† the NiO-NS device shows a longer lifetime than that of the NiO-NP device, indicating more efficient hole extraction and charge separation as discussed above.

Though the NiO-NS films showed a lower surface area than NiO-NP films, the NiO-NS based device have better performance. This can be attributed to better pore filling, better perovskite crystallinity, and a suitable NiO surface. The BET results in Table S1 and Fig. S5† show that the NiO-NS film has a larger pore size than that of the NiO-NP film. Therefore, the perovskite can easily infiltrate from the top to the bottom mesoporous electrode in NiO-NS films. This benefits the pore filling of the perovskite. In addition, larger perovskite grains should form in the pores of NiO-NS, reducing the probability of charge recombination.54,55 The PL decay study confirmed that the effective charge transfer dominates device performance rather than the apparent mesoporous electrode surface area. This clearly indicates favourable perovskite/NiO interfaces for charge extraction in NiO-NS films. The counter electrode interfaces also affected the device performance. As shown in Fig. S6,† the NiO-NS device exhibits a relatively smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) than that of the NiO-NP device. This may be due to the better electrical contact of the three components at the counter electrode interface, which enhances the charge collection at this interface. As a result of aforementioned effects, the employment of NiO nanosheets as efficient hole conductors facilitating hole extraction, and retarding the charge recombination, resulted in a 30 mV higher VOC and a 1 mA cm−2 higher JSC.
Carbon based PVSC devices have been proven to possess good thermal stability compared to conventional cells with a metal back contact.29,59 We also conducted long-term stability testing on NiO-NS PVSCs. After being capsulated under N2 in a glovebox, the sealed devices were subjected to constant light illumination with a light density of 75 mW cm−2 at 50 °C. Fig. 9 shows the normalized PCE as a function of storage time. The device still showed 60% of the initial highest PCE after light soaking for 250 hours at 50 °C. During the testing, the photocurrent dropped quickly during the first 50 hours. The relatively good stability of this type of solar cell may be attributed to the hydrophobic property of carbon materials and the thick perovskite layer used, which might induce a slow degradation.60 Nevertheless, the stability of perovskite solar cells is still a major concern for future practical applications.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated carbon electrode based perovskite solar cells utilizing highly crystalline NiO nanosheets as top hole transport layers. The NiO nanosheets provide superior charge collection and a prolonged charge lifetime, resulting in a 15% increase of energy conversion efficiency compared to the NiO nanoparticle based devices, and achieving a cell with an impressive energy conversion efficiency of 14.2% under AM 1.5G conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first report of nanostructure optimization for the top charge transport layer in perovskite solar cells. We suggest that an efficient nanostructured top charge conductor can further enhance the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells.
