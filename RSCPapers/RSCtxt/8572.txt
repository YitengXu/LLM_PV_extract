    , Accepted 21st June 2020First published on 22nd June 2020AbstractBismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is a promising material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. However, the sluggish water oxidation kinetics, poor electron transport properties and severe charge recombination limit its performance. Here, a new type of triadic photoanode is developed by rationally designing the electrode structure. The NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) serves as a water oxidation catalyst (WOC) to accelerate the transportation of the photo-generated holes from the BiVO4 photoelectrode to the electrolyte for improving the water oxidation reaction, while the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets serve as an efficient electron shuttling mediator for suppressing the electron–hole recombination at the BiVO4/NiFe-LDH interfaces. On the other hand, rGO can positively shift the electrodeposion potential of NiFe-LDH (−0.1 V vs. RHE) which can greatly protect the BiVO4 electrode, since a more negative potential would reduce its PEC activity. This electrode exhibits a significantly higher photocurrent density than those of its pristine BiVO4, BiVO4/rGO, and BiVO4/NiFe-LDH counterparts, producing a photocurrent density of 3.26 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination and showing excellent stability. The improved PEC performance is attributed to the accelerated charge separation/transfer between the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces and surface water oxidation reaction due to the synergistic effect of rGO and NiFe-LDH.
1. Introduction
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been regarded as the Holy Grail for sustainable hydrogen production.1–3 However, practical applications of PEC water splitting have not been realized due to the low solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies. The exploration of efficient semiconductor-based photoelectrodes is the key to achieve high STH efficiencies.4–6 Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has emerged as a promising photoanode material for PEC water splitting due to its suitable bandgap (2.4–2.6 eV), appropriate valence band (VB) position for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and good stability.7,8 Nevertheless, sluggish water oxidation kinetics and poor charge transport properties cause severe charge recombination in both surface and bulk of BiVO4 photoanodes, resulting in very poor PEC performances.9–11 Although heterojunction construction,12,13 elemental doping,14,15 intrinsic defect generation,16–18 crystal facet engineering19,20 and nanostructure engineering21 are effective to improve the intrinsic charge separation, surface modification on the BiVO4 surfaces is still indispensable to accelerate the water oxidation kinetics towards efficient PEC water splitting.
Modifying the BiVO4 surfaces with efficient water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) is one of the most common approaches to facilitate the water oxidation kinetics. Recently, Co-, Ni- and Fe-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted increasing attention as efficient and cost-effective WOCs for electrocatalytic water splitting without light illumination.22–25 However, the reported LDHs modified BiVO4 photoanodes for PEC water splitting only exhibit moderate performances.26–28 To achieve high PEC performance, excellent interfacial contact between LDHs and BiVO4, and good coverage of LDHs on BiVO4 surfaces are the general criteria. On the other hand, the method to deposit LDHs should not cause detrimental effect on the PEC performance of BiVO4 itself. For example, electrodeposition of LDHs on photoelectrodes usually requires a relatively negative potential.26 Unfortunately, BiVO4 is sensitive to the applied potential and would be inactivated when treated at a potential lower than −0.1 V vs. RHE for a very short time.29 Thus, how to enable the electrodeposition of LDH on BiVO4 surfaces at a mild potential is highly desirable while challenging.
Herein, we successfully electrodeposit NiFe-LDH on BiVO4 photoanodes at a mild potential of −0.1 V vs. RHE by firstly spin-coating reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets on the surfaces of BiVO4, which is different from a previous report that requires a relatively negative potential for the deposition of NiFe-LDH.30 The dual functions of rGO is demonstrated in the BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanode: rGO sheets act as an efficient electron shuttling mediator for suppressing the electron–hole recombination on the surfaces of BiVO4 by quickly extracting the photogenerated holes from BiVO4 and promoting the formation of NiFe-LDH at a mild potential. Meanwhile NiFe-LDH serves as a WOC to accelerate the transportation of photo-generated holes to the electrolyte for fast water oxidation reaction. Density Function Theory (DFT) calculations reveal that LDH deposited on rGO requires lower Gibbs free energy than on the BiVO4 surfaces, which is essential to synthesize BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanode without reducing the activity of BiVO4. The new findings demonstrated in this work may open up a new avenue for the design of efficient photoelectrodes for solar fuel production.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of BiVO4 electrodes
The nanoporous BiVO4 films on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates were synthesized according to a previous report with some modifications.31 First, the BiOI precursor was prepared by a typical three-electrode electrochemical deposition method with FTO substrates (1.5 cm × 5.0 cm) as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode and saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The BiOI precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.04 M Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98.0%) in 50 mL of 0.40 M potassium iodide (KI, Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.5%) solution with a pH adjusted to 1.7 by HNO3 and vigorously stirred for 10 min. Then the solution was mixed with 0.23 M p-benzoquinone (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98%) solved in 20 mL of ethanol. Electrodeposition was carried out at −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 4 min at room temperature. The prepared BiOI electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and dried in air. After that, 0.2 mL of 0.2 M vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2, Fluka, ≥97.0%) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was placed on the surface of the prepared BiOI electrode. Finally, it was annealed in a muffle furnace at 450 °C (ramp rate = 2 °C min−1) for 2 h. Then, the electrode was soaked in 1 M KOH (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥90.0%) solution for 30 min to remove the excess V2O5. The resulting pure BiVO4 electrodes were rinsed with deionized water and dried in air.
2.2 Preparation of BiVO4/rGO electrodes
Graphite oxide (GO) was prepared via a modified Hummers' method.32 Then the BiVO4/rGO electrode was prepared by spin-coating a GO aqueous solution (2.0 mg mL−1) onto the prepared BiVO4 nanoporous films with dimensions of 1.5 cm × 2.0 cm. The sample was transferred into a tube furnace at 300 °C in an argon atmosphere for 2 h, by which the GO was reduced to rGO and the adhesion between the rGO and BiVO4 was improved.
2.3 Preparation of BiVO4/NiFe-LDH, BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH and NiFe-LDH electrodes
The NiFe-LDH layer was deposited onto the surface of BiVO4/rGO electrodes (dimensions: 1.5 cm × 2.0 cm) via a three-electrode electrochemical cell using BiVO4/rGO electrodes as the working electrode, while Pt wire and saturated Ag/AgCl as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The same experimental conditions were employed to electrodeposit NiFe-LDH on the BiVO4 electrode except that the working electrode was a BiVO4 electrode. The three-electrode system were immersed in the 50 mL electrolyte containing 7.5 × 10−3 M Ni(NO3)2 (Sigma-Aldrich,≥ 99.0%) and 7.5 × 10−3 M Fe(NO3)3 (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98.0%). Deposition was carried out at a constant negative potential ranging from −0.1 to −0.5 V vs. RHE. The resulting BiVO4/NiFe-LDH and BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanodes were rinsed with deionized water and dried in air. The optimization of the BiVO4/NiFe-LDH and BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanodes with different deposition time and potentials was shown in the ESI (Fig. S4 and S14†). NiFe-LDH electrodes were deposited on FTO substrates at −0.5 V vs. RHE.
2.4 Characterization
The surface morphologies of the as-prepared electrodes were investigated using a JEOL JSM-7100F (USA) field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a FEI Tecnai 20 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The crystalline phase of the prepared samples was identified by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Bruker, USA) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). The solid UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra were measured by a JASCO V-650 spectrophotometer. The Raman spectra were obtained on a Renishaw Raman Microscope with a 514 nm laser as the excitation source. The chemical composition of the samples was performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an Al Kα (hν = 1253.6 eV) radiation source. The binding energies were calibrated based on the graphite C 1s peak of 284.8 eV as a reference.
2.5 PEC performance measurements
All PEC performances of the photoanodes were performed in a typical three-electrode PEC cell with a flat quartz window at room temperature under a 150 W Xe lamp with an AM 1.5G filter (illumination intensity: ca.100 mW cm−2). 1 M H3BO3 solution with a pH adjusted to 9.33 by KOH was used as the electrolyte. The photoanodes were covered by a mask and sealed with epoxy resin, exposing an active area of 0.7 cm2 for light illumination. Linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) and amperometric I–t curves were measured on an electrochemical work station (CHI660d, CH Instruments, Inc.) with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Long-term stability of the photoanode was evaluated at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination for 60 min. To evaluate the oxygen evolution performance, the BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanode was measured in an air-tight cell at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination for 60 min and the produced gas at the photoanode was detected with a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-2014) every 15 min.
The measured potentials vs. Ag/AgCl were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale with the Nernst equation: (1)where ERHE refers to the converted potential vs. RHE. The value of  is 0.197 V at RT (25 °C).
Applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) can be calculated using the following equation:33 (2)where Vb is the applied bias versus RHE (V), Jb refers to the photocurrent density at the measured bias Vb (mA cm−2), and Ptot is the total light intensity of AM 1.5 G (100 mV cm−2).
To confirm the superior surface hole transfer and efficient charge separation, the charge-transfer efficiency was quantified using a Na2SO3 solution electrolyte as a hole scavenger. The charge transfer efficiency (ηtrans) can be easily calculated as following:34 ηtrans (%) = JH2O / JNa2SO3 × 100(3)where JH2O and JNa2SO3 are the photocurrent density with and without a hole scavenger, respectively.
The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained by using a CHI660d electrochemical work station to apply a certain potential and a Newport 1918-c power meter for measuring the power density at a specific wavelength. IPCE can be calculated as:35 IPCE = (1240J)/λPlight(4)where J is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) measured from the electrochemical workstation, λ refers to the incident light wavelength (nm), and Plight is the power density measured at each wavelength (mW cm−2).
The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the samples were carried out in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with an amplitude of 10 mV at a potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE under simulated sunlight irradiation. Mott–Schottky (MS) plots were obtained with a voltage of 100 mV at a frequency of 1 kHz in the dark.
2.6 Theoretical calculations
First-principles calculations were performed based on the Density Function Theory (DFT) using all-electron projected augmented wave (PAW) method as implemented in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code. The exchange and correlation interaction were described using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. The cutoff energy of 500 eV and a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling was used for the super cell calculations. A vacuum layer of 25 Å was used to isolate the slab as the boundary condition.
3. Results and discussion
The BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanode was fabricated as the follows: first, the nanoporous BiVO4 films was grown on FTO substrates via a previously reported method.31 Then, GO nanosheets were spin-coated onto the BiVO4 films, followed by annealing in an argon atmosphere to reduce GO and improve the adhesion between rGO and BiVO4 (denoted as BiVO4/rGO). Finally, NiFe-LDH nanoplatelets were electrodeposited on the surfaces of the BiVO4/rGO (denoted as BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH). Interestingly, compared to the SEM image of BiVO4 (Fig. 1A), neither rGO nor NiFe-LDH can be observed in the SEM images of BiVO4/rGO (Fig. 1B) and BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH (Fig. 1C), possibly due to the very small loading amount of rGO and NiFe-LDH. To further confirm the coating of rGO on BiVO4, the BiVO4/rGO and rGO samples were characterized by high resolution SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. S1A,† a rGO sheet connecting the BiVO4 particles can be observed. According to Fig. S1B and C,† ultrathin rGO sheets were successfully coated on the BiVO4 surfaces. Cross-sectional SEM images show that the thicknesses of both BiVO4 and BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH films are around 1 μm (Fig. S2†), suggesting that deposition of rGO/NiFe-LDH does not affect the film thickness as well.

TEM and HRTEM were conducted to confirm the successful deposition of rGO and NiFe-LDH on the surfaces of BiVO4. As shown in Fig. 1D, BiVO4 nanoparticles are well wrapped by ultrathin rGO nanosheets and the surfaces are homogeneously decorated by numerous nanoplatelets with an average lateral size of ∼10 nm. The interplanar spacing of the surface nanoplatelets was measured as 0.27 nm (Fig. 1E), corresponding to the d-spacing of NiFe-LDH (012) planes.36 In addition, the EDS mapping images illustrate uniform signals for Bi, O, V, Ni and Fe elements (Fig. 1F). Based on the above analyses, a BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH film with homogeneous distribution of NiFe-LDH nanoplatelets on the BiVO4/rGO surface was successfully achieved.
The composition and phase structure of these obtained samples were investigated by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2A, along with the FTO peaks, all peaks in the XRD pattern of BiVO4 can be indexed to monoclinic BiVO4 (JCPDS 14-0688).37 BiVO4/rGO shows similar XRD pattern with that of BiVO4. The absence of the typical diffraction peaks of rGO could be attributed to the high dispersion of rGO and/or its small loading amount.38 A new reflection of a typical LDH phase appears after the electrodeposition of NiFe-LDH (Fig. S3†). The relatively low intensity of the LDH peak could be due to the low loading amount and/or NiFe-LDH units formed in a preferred orientation relative to the FTO substrate.26,39 Interestingly, no NiFe-LDH peaks can be observed for BiVO4/NiFe-LDH, indicating that rGO may affect the loading amount of NiFe-LDH during electrodeposition. Raman spectra of all samples exhibit typical characteristics for BiVO4 (Fig. 2B). The most intense Raman band at around 828cm−1 is related to the V–O symmetric stretching mode, while the weak shoulder at around 711cm−1 is due to the V–O antisymmetric stretch.40 The band at 211cm−1 is assigned to the external mode (translation/rotation) of BiVO4, and the bands at 367 and 327cm−1 are ascribed to the symmetric and asymmetric deformation modes of the VO43− tetrahedron, respectively.40 Two bands located at 1367 cm−1 (D band) and 1596 cm−1 (G band) are observed in both BiVO4/rGO and BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH, demonstrating the presence of rGO (Fig. 2B).41 The BiVO4/rGO and BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH display obviously decreased intensity ratio of D to G band (ID/IG = 0.377 and 0.465, respectively) compared to pure rGO (ID/IG = 0.99), which is assigned to the high crystallinity of rGO with reduced surface defects on these films.41

The chemical composition and bonding configuration of the as-prepared photoanodes were analyzed by XPS. As shown in Fig. 3A–C, the peaks of Bi, V and O are observed in all photoanodes, indicating the surface ultrathin rGO and NiFe-LDH layers do not block the signals of the underneath BiVO4, which is consistent to the results shown in Fig. 1. Peaks with binding energies of 158.87 and 164.17 eV are assigned to Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 corresponding to Bi3+, and the peaks at 516.72 and 524.47 eV are the signals of V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 corresponding to V5+, respectively.42 Moreover, the XPS results further confirm the presence of both Ni and Fe in the BiVO4/NiFe-LDH and BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH films (Fig. 3D and E). The Ni 2p3/2 (855.99 eV) and Ni 2p1/2 (873.79 eV) peaks with two satellite bands indicate that Ni is in Ni2+ oxidation state. While Fe 2p1/2 (724.64 eV) and Fe 2p3/2 (711.54 eV) accompanied with a satellite band (716.14 eV) indicate the existence of the Fe3+ state.43 The atomic ratio of Ni and Fe is calculated to be ∼1. In addition, the O 1s spectrum of BiVO4 is divided into two peaks at 529.5 and 530.6 eV (Fig. 3C), corresponding to oxygen (O2−) in the lattice of BiVO4 and the surface absorbed OH group, respectively.9 Compared to pure BiVO4, there is a positive shift of 0.27 eV in the positions of Bi 4f7/2 (159.14 eV) and Bi 4f5/2 (164.44 eV) after the incorporation of rGO (Fig. 3A). Similarly, a positive shift of the O2− peak (529.7 eV) is detected after the combination with rGO (Fig. 3C). The positive shift of binding energies for both Bi 4f and O 1s indicates a decrease in the electron density of BiVO4. This can be ascribed to the surface binding interaction between BiVO4 and rGO, which induces an electron transfer from BiVO4 to rGO.41 In contrast, the binding energies of V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 in BiVO4/NiFe-LDH show a negative shift to 516.38 and 523.88 eV, respectively (Fig. 3B), compared to those in pristine BiVO4. This negative shift of V 2p binding energy accompanied with the positive shift of Fe 2p and Ni 2p binding energies (Fig. 3D and E) indicate an electron transfer from NiFe-LDH to BiVO4.

PEC measurements were performed using BiVO4, BiVO4/NiFe-LDH, BiVO4/rGO, and BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH as the photoanodes, respectively. By carefully tuning the electrodeposition time of the NiFe-LDH layer, the BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanode with an optimized loading amount of NiFe-LDH promotes water oxidation reaction, achieving the highest photocurrent densities (Fig. S4†). As shown in the LSV curves (Fig. 4A), all these samples display a quick and renewable photocurrent response with respect to the ON–OFF cycles of the light irradiation. Pristine BiVO4 displays a relatively low photo-response over the whole potential window, with a photocurrent density of 1.14 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Despite some improvement, the PEC performance for the rGO modified BiVO4 photoanode (BiVO4/rGO) is moderate, probably due to the poor surface oxygen evolution kinetics and the rebuilt recombination sites on rGO.44 In contrast, BiVO4/NiFe-LDH shows a largely enhanced photocurrent density (2.78 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V) with a similar onset potential to pristine BiVO4. Impressively, BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH exhibits the highest photocurrent density among these four photoanodes, reaching 3.26 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V, which is also higher than most of the reported BiVO4/LDH photoanodes (Table 1). To further confirm the role of rGO, another BiVO4/NiFe-LDH/rGO photoanode was prepared and the PEC performance was measured. As shown in Fig. S5,† BiVO4/NiFe-LDH/rGO exhibits a photocurrent density of only 2.42 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V, which is lower than that of the BiVO4/NiFe-LDH, possibly due to the surface deposition of rGO that block the transfer of holes to the electrolyte for water oxidation. It should be mentioned that since the exposed area of our photoanodes are relatively large (0.7 cm2), the resistivity in the film increases and the H+/OH− transport is relatively slow,45 leading to a bit lower photocurrent densities compared to previous reports with smaller exposed areas.31,46 In addition, BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanodes exhibit higher PEC performance in alkaline borate buffer electrolyte (pH = 9.33) than in neutral KHPO4 electrolyte (pH = 7), as shown in Fig. S6.† According to eqn (2), an impressive ABPE of approximately 1.1% is achieved for BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH at a low applied potential of 0.71 V vs. RHE, which is over 5 times higher than that of the pristine BiVO4 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the ABPE peak of the BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH is negatively shifted (Fig. 4B), which is associated to the increase of the photocurrent densities at the lower applied potentials according to eqn (2).

To visualize the impact of rGO and NiFe-LDH on the surface charge transfer efficiency (ηtrans) of the BiVO4 photoanodes, LSV curves of all photoanodes were also conducted in the presence of 0.2 M Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger. As shown in Fig. S7,† LSV curves of all samples are almost overlapped, indicating that their charge separation properties are very similar. According to eqn (3), their ηtrans curves were calculated. As shown in Fig. 4C, BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH exhibits a relatively high ηtrans of approximately 70% at a low applied potential of 0.6 V vs. RHE, which is much higher than those of BiVO4 (10%), BiVO4/rGO (20%), and BiVO4/NiFe-LDH (40%). Moreover, the ηtrans of BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH at 1.23 V vs. RHE is as high as 90%, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art oxygen evolution cocatalyst modified BiVO4 photoanodes.47,48 Based on the above discussions, rGO and NiFe-LDH can synergistically promote the charge transfer in the photoanode/electrolyte interface, which effectively accelerate the surface kinetics for water oxidation.
Amperometric I–t curves were conducted to further investigate the photo-response of BiVO4, BiVO4/NiFe-LDH, BiVO4/rGO, and BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH. As shown in Fig. 4D, the photocurrent densities of these photoanodes under AM 1.5 G illumination follow a descending order as: BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH > BiVO4/NiFe-LDH > BiVO4/rGO > pristine BiVO4, which is highly consistent to the LSV results in Fig. 4A and further demonstrates that both rGO and NiFe-LDH play important roles in improving the PEC performance of BiVO4. Strong spikes are observed for the bare BiVO4 and BiVO4/rGO photoanodes when the light is switched on in each cycle, indicating severe charge recombination due to the slow water oxidation kinetics. In addition, BiVO4/NiFe-LDH also exhibits decay of photocurrent densities, suggesting that only NiFe-LDH is not sufficient to promote surface charge separation. Compared to BiVO4, BiVO4/NiFe-LDH and BiVO4/rGO photoanodes, BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH has a much steadier photocurrent density, indicating a much faster surface oxidation kinetics that suppresses the recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs and thus achieving excellent PEC stability, as further demonstrated in Fig. S8.† Oxygen evolution performance of BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH was studied in an air-tight cell and the produced gas at the photoanode was detected by a gas chromatography (GC) every 15 min. As shown in Fig. S9,† the produced O2 gas is 25.4 μmol cm−2 after 60 min, corresponding to a faradaic efficiency of 91.8%. To further understand the charge separation properties, PL spectroscopy was also performed for the BiVO4, BiVO4/NiFe-LDH, BiVO4/rGO, and BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH films with an excitation laser at 375 nm in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm at room temperature. As shown in Fig. S10,† the PL intensity of BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH is much weaker than those of BiVO4, BiVO4/NiFe-LDH, and BiVO4/rGO, indicating the direct recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes is significantly suppressed.49
To further understand the underlying mechanisms of the significant enhanced PEC water oxidation performance with the synergistic modification of rGO and NiFe-LDH, the light absorption, optical properties, IPCE, and EIS of the obtained samples were investigated. As shown in Fig. 5A, BiVO4 exhibits a significantly optical absorption below 450 nm with an absorption edge of ∼520 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of 2.57 eV (Fig. 5B). The absorption edge of NiFe-LDH is around 590 nm (Fig. S11A†), corresponding to a bandgap of 2.1 eV (Fig. S11B†). Interestingly, BiVO4/NiFe-LDH exhibits a similar light absorption edge compared to that of bare BiVO4, possibly due to the very small loading amount of NiFe-LDH. After the introduction of rGO and NiFe-LDH, the absorbance in the visible light region increases slightly and the bandgap decreases to 2.55 eV, which is due to incorporation of rGO that enhance the absorption range of visible light. IPCE was measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. 5C). All these samples exhibit photocatalytic activity from 350 nm to 520 nm, which is in good agreement with their UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Fig. 5A). The maximum IPCEs of these photoanodes are obtained at 455 nm, which are 20%, 38%, and 40% for BiVO4, BiVO4/NiFe-LDH, and BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH, respectively. The largely enhanced IPCE of BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH further confirmed the synergistic effect of rGO and NiFe-LDH to the PEC performance.

EIS studies were carried out to investigate the charge transfer at the photoanodes. EIS curves of the photoanodes are shown in Fig. 5D and the corresponding fitting results are listed in Table S1† according to the equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. 5D). As shown in Table S1,† the Rs values of BiVO4, BiVO4/NiFe-LDH, and BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH are very similar, indicating that these photoanodes were tested under similar conditions and thus their Rct can be reasonably compared. The BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanode shows a Rct of 248.0 ± 2.4 Ω, which is much smaller than those of the others, indicating the smallest charge transfer resistance and the fastest charge transport kinetics among the three photoanodes. Moreover, MS plots of NiFe-LDH, BiVO4 and BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH exhibit positive slopes (Fig. S12†), indicating the n-type characteristics. Compared to NiFe-LDH and BiVO4, a slightly positive shift of the potential at the intersection of the x axis is observed for BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH, indicating the formation of heterojunction.50 According to the MS plots (Fig. S12†), the flat band potential (Efb) of BiVO4 and NiFe-LDH are 0.39 and 0.38 V vs. RHE, respectively. Since the conduction band (CB) of a n-type semiconductor is approximately 0.2 more negative than the Efb,51 the CB values of BiVO4 and NiFe-LDH are 0.19 and 0.18 V, respectively. According to Fig. 5B and S11B,† the bandgap energies (Eg) of BiVO4 and NiFe-LDH are approximately 2.57 and 2.1 eV, respectively. Thus, the VB values of BiVO4 and NiFe-LDH are 2.38 and 1.92 V vs. RHE, respectively. The band alignment between BiVO4 and NiFe-LDH is shown in Fig. S13,† indicating that photogenerated holes in the VB of BiVO4 can transfer to the VB of NiFe-LDH through rGO.
Generally, a relatively negative potential is required for the electrodeposition of LDHs on photoelectrodes. However, too negative potential would destroy the BiVO4 photoanodes, resulting in very low PEC performances.29 Interestingly, we found that rGO deposited on the surface of BiVO4 can positively shift the required potential for the deposition of LDHs, and thus higher PEC performances can be achieved. As shown in Fig. S14A,† BiVO4/NiFe-LDH photoanodes with NiFe-LDH deposited at −0.3 V vs. RHE show the highest photocurrent density of approximately 2.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V. It should be mentioned that the too negative applied potential has detrimental effect on BiVO4 itself, but the surface deposition of NiFe-LDH can promote charge transfer on the surfaces, leading enhanced photocurrent densities compared to bare BiVO4. However, with the surface deposition of rGO, the BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanodes with NiFe-LDH deposited at a more positive potential of −0.1 V vs. RHE exhibit the highest photocurrent density of 3.26 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V (Fig. S14B†). Note that, without rGO, a BiVO4/NiFe-LDH photoanode with NiFe-LDH deposited at −0.1 V vs. RHE can only achieve a photocurrent density of 1.8 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V, which is approximately half that of the BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanode. The above results indicate that rGO may play an essential role in promoting the formation of NiFe-LDH under a mild condition.
To confirm our hypothesis, DFT calculations were performed to investigate the formation mechanism of NiFe-LDH on a BiVO4 photoanode with and without rGO. As presented in Fig. 6A, NiFe-LDH is formed on the surface of BiVO4 and BiVO4/rGO via in situ electrochemical deposition. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) takes place in cathode while NiFe-LDH is generated in the surface of the cathode (BiVO4 or BiVO4/rGO). In acid solution, H+ is adsorbed on the cathode and becomes active H* by combining with an electron. Then, two active H* form H2 that releases from the surface. With the evolution of H2, the concentration of H+ decreases while OH− released from water splitting becomes enriched. It is easy to form NiFe-LDH on the cathode with the attracted Fe3+ and Ni2+ near the cathode due to the coulomb interaction. The reaction process follows the pathways: 2H+ + 2e− → H2(5) H2O → H+ + OH−(6) OH− + Ni2+ + Fe3+ → NiFe-LDH(7)
 Fig. 6  (A) Formation mechanism of NiFe-LDH on anodes by electrochemical deposition. The free energy diagram for HER follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky pathway (B) and the Volmer–Tafel pathway (C) on surface sites of BiVO4 and BiVO4/rGO. rGO-1 and rGO-2 were reaction pathways on edge and non-edge carbons of BiVO4/rGO, respectively. (D) Surface structures of BiVO4 (001) and BiVO4/rGO (the carbons with green cycle was the non-edge carbons). The free energy diagram for intermediate-state and extra-state of HER follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky (E) and the Volmer–Tafel pathway (F) on surface sites of BiVO4 and BiVO4/rGO with various potential. 
The activity of the cathode material for NiFe-LDH formation can be described by HER activity of the material. Herein, the surface structures of BiVO4 and BiVO4/rGO were built for investigating the HER activity. Generally, in an acidic solution, the HER takes place through either the Volmer–Heyrovsky (9) or Volmer–Tafel pathway (11).52 The HER free energy diagram was constructed to reveal the reaction mechanism and activity for the cathode materials. Four-state was considered in the overall HER for the free energy diagram: initial-state (H+ + e−), intermediate-state (H*, active H adsorbed on surface), extra-state (H2* or 2H*), and final-state product (H2).53 H+ + e− → H* (Volmer step)(8) (9) H2* → H2(10) H* + H* → H2 (Tafel step)(11)
The HER free energy following the Volmer–Heyrovsky pathway and Volmer–Tafel pathway was used to reveal the important role of rGO in the reaction, respectively. As is shown in Fig. 6B (the Volmer–Heyrovsky pathway), the free energy changes significantly with all sites (including various sites of BiVO4, edge site and non-edge site carbons of rGO) during the first step (the Volmer step). Hence, the Volmer step is the rate-determining step of the overall reaction. Distinctly, the activity of the edge carbons is better than that of the non-edge carbons, and even much higher than that of BiVO4. Compared with the Volmer step, the free energy of the Tafel step (M − 2H*) changes slightly as shown in Fig. 6C (the Volmer–Tafel pathway). Therefore, the energy favorable Volmer–Heyrovsky pathway is the dominant mechanism on the three sites of the surface.
Surface structures of BiVO4 (001) and BiVO4/rGO are schematically illustrated in Fig. 6D. The HER is dominated by the Volmer step and/or Tafel step on the surface of BiVO4 and BiVO4/rGO. The free energy of the Volmer step and Tafel step on the surface of BiVO4 and non-edge carbons of BiVO4/rGO were calculated with various potentials to evaluate the effect of potential. As illustrated in Fig. 6E, free energy decreases with the increase of the absolute value of potential (minus represent direction). The free energies of the Volmer step becomes 0 (or lower than 0) in the BiVO4/rGO system when the potential is about −0.1 V, which is higher than that in the BiVO4 system (about −0.2 V). Similarly, BiVO4/rGO (−0.25 V) is better than BiVO4 (−0.45 V) for Tafel (Fig. 6F). Therefore, compared with BiVO4, NiFe-LDH is easy to be deposited in the system with rGO at a more positive potential, which can effectively keep the activity of BiVO4 as mentioned before.
Based on the discussions above, a schematic description of the mechanism for the PEC water splitting in the BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanode system is illustrated in Fig. 7. Due to the presence of rGO as an efficient electron shuttling mediator in the interfaces of BiVO4 and NiFe-LDH, the holes (h+) with strong oxidative power generated in the valence band of BiVO4 upon light irradiation can be efficiently transferred to NiFe-LDH through rGO, followed by the subsequent transfer to the surface-adsorbed water molecules to generate O2. It should be mentioned that the possible transfer of the photogenerated electrons from BiVO4 to rGO is suppressed because of the formation of a positive electric field during PEC water splitting process. Thus, the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs can be significantly reduced. As a result, the simultaneous existence of rGO and NiFe-LDH oxidation co-catalyst benefits the efficient separation and transfer of the photo-excited electrons and holes and thus effectively improves the water splitting efficiency.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that rGO could promote the growth of NiFe-LDH on a BiVO4 photoanode at a mild potential. With the modification of rGO and NiFe-LDH, the photocurrent density of BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanode increases to 3.26 mA cm−2 compared with pristine BiVO4 (1.14 mA cm−2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. The stability is also increased. The IPCE of BiVO4/rGO/NiFe-LDH at 1.23 V increases to approximately 40%, which is much higher than that of the pristine BiVO4. The synergistic effect between rGO and NiFe-LDH simultaneously enhances the charge separation and water oxidation kinetics of the BiVO4 photoanode. The new findings demonstrated in this work would inspire the design of efficient photoelectrodes for solar fuel production.

 	Fig. 6  (A) Formation mechanism of NiFe-LDH on anodes by electrochemical deposition. The free energy diagram for HER follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky pathway (B) and the Volmer–Tafel pathway (C) on surface sites of BiVO4 and BiVO4/rGO. rGO-1 and rGO-2 were reaction pathways on edge and non-edge carbons of BiVO4/rGO, respectively. (D) Surface structures of BiVO4 (001) and BiVO4/rGO (the carbons with green cycle was the non-edge carbons). The free energy diagram for intermediate-state and extra-state of HER follows the Volmer–Heyrovsky (E) and the Volmer–Tafel pathway (F) on surface sites of BiVO4 and BiVO4/rGO with various potential.
