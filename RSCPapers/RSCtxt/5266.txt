    , Accepted 21st November 2018First published on 21st November 2018AbstractFuel cells have been recognized as promising next generation energy conversion devices. Recently, using semiconductors to improve the performance of fuel cell reactions under light irradiation has received increasing attention. In this paper, we used long-wavelength-absorption bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) nanosheets coupled with graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets to form a 2D/2D composite. This 2D/2D heterojunction has a broad light harvesting ability in the visible light region, which provides an advantage for the unitization of solar energy. By decorating with Pt nanoparticles, the as-synthesized Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI electrode shows a 16.9 times enhanced catalytic activity under visible light (>420 nm) illumination compared to that of the conventional electrocatalytic oxidation reaction (dark conditions). Even using 600 ± 15 nm red light irradiation, the mass activity of Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI for the ethanol oxidation reaction reaches 53.1 mA mgPt−1. Furthermore, the stability of the as-prepared Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI were also improved by using light illumination. These results provide a model for the construction of 2D/2D heterostructures for solar light-enhanced electrocatalysis in fuel cells using their broad absorption properties.
1. Introduction
Motivated by the success of graphene, two dimensional (2D) photocatalysts materials have received significant interest for the conversion of solar energy in artificial photosynthesis systems owing to their unique structural features.1–3 Among the 2D photocatalysts materials, graphite-like carbon nitride (g-C3N4), has received a large amount of research interest ever since Wang et al. reported its highly efficient photocatalytic properties under visible light illumination in 2009.3–9 Beside the nontoxicity and low cost of mass production, g-C3N4 also possesses a high thermal and chemical stability during the photocatalytic process. Nowadays, g-C3N4 has broad applications in the field of artificial photosynthesis systems including water splitting, degradation of organic pollutants, and so on.4–15 However, there is still a strong desire to develop new directions for this material and to extend its broad applications in addition to the use in artificial photosynthesis systems. For example, Du's group developed a photo-electrochemical sensor for the detection of rutin by using g-C3N4 with graphene.16 Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the electron transfer capacity of graphene and the photo-response of g-C3N4, the sensor obtained a low detection limit of 1.78 × 10−9 mol L−1. Recently, we also reported that an ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheet as a photoactivated carrier for the deposition of Pt, which then worked as a electrocatalyst for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol.17 It is well known that the fuel cell is a power-generation device which converts chemical energy directly into electrical energy,18–20 and the alcohol oxidation reaction is a key reaction in the direct alcohol fuel cell. In this system, the use of g-C3N4 decreases the usage of precious Pt, resulting in a lower cost electrode. Moreover, compared with the conventional electrocatalytic reaction, the presence of g-C3N4 improves the catalytic activity by 3.3 times for the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol in an alkaline media under visible light irradiation.17
However, in order to achieve ideal catalytic efficiency in a fuel cell, there are still some drawbacks to pure g-C3N4 that block its further application: (1) the intrinsic electronic structure of g-C3N4 with a suitable band gap (2.7 eV) can only harvests photons with a solar spectrum less than the 460 nm region. (2) The rapid recombination rate of the photogenerated electrons and holes during the photo-irradiation process. These drawbacks have forced us to find an effective way to achieve the highly efficient harvesting of visible photons of solar energy, as well as the high efficiency of the catalytic activity. Accordingly, coupling a narrow band gap semiconductor to a well-matched energy band with g-C3N4 to form composite is a feasible solution. This is because the narrow band endows broad light response ranges to ensure the light harvesting efficiency. Moreover, the well-matched energy band improves the efficiency of the charge carrier separation, achieving a higher photocatalytic efficiency.
Herein, we chose layered bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) nanosheets as a narrow band semiconductor and coupled these with g-C3N4 nanosheets to form a 2D/2D composite. Firstly, the narrow band (ca. 1.7 eV) of BiOI provides an absorption range up to 660 nm, which is of a particularly importance for using solar energy effectively.21–23 Secondly, the band diagrams of BiOI and g-C3N4 are suitable to form a type II heterojunction, in which the generated electron–hole pairs are easily separated.24 Thirdly, the desired 2D/2D heterostructure gives the advantages of a large contact surface and a high charge transfer rate, achieving a high photocatalytic efficiency.8 Although some researchers have reported the formation of a g-C3N4/BiOI heterojunction, most of these works use g-C3N4 as a hybrid with BiOI spheres or particles and all of these cases are restricted to the application of the photodegradation of dyes.24–28 As mentioned previously, the use of 2D/2D heterojunctions to extend the broad applications of g-C3N4 is an important issue.
Hence, we constructed a 2D/2D heterostructure by coupling a g-C3N4 nanosheet with a BiOI nanosheet and this was then used as carrier to deposit Pt electrocatalysts. As shown in Scheme 1, the as-prepared Pt decorating g-C3N4/BiOI composites were deposited on the surface of an L-type glass carbon electrode and then used as a working electrode to investigate the electrocatalytic performance of the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). We have obtained the as-synthesized Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI electrode and it: (1) showed a 16.9 times enhanced catalytic activity under visible light compared with that in a dark environment; (2) displayed a 5.07 and 2.82 folds increase compared to that observed for Pt/g-C3N4 and Pt/BiOI, respectively, under visible light irradiation; (3) still exhibited a photo-enhanced electrocatalytic performance under red light (600 nm) irradiation; and (4) an enhanced charge separation was demonstrated in the heterojunction via photoelectrochemical properties and electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of 2D/2D g-C3N4/BiOI for the improvement of traditional electrocatalytic activities on ethanol oxidation with long wavelength (extended to >600 nm) irradiation. The present work opens up a new avenue to constructing highly efficient photo-activated electrodes in the fuel cell reaction using coupling with narrow band functional materials.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Chemicals
Ethylenediamine (C2H8N2), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide ([bmim]I), chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O), bismuth nitrate [Bi(NO3)3·5H2O], ethanol (CH3CH2OH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), 5,5-dimethyl-l-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO), and so forth, were purchased and used directly without further purification (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China).
2.2 Preparation of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4/BiOI heterojunction
2D sheet-like g-C3N4 and BiOI nanomaterials were synthesized by heating urea in a semiclosed environment and using a simple hydrothermal reaction method, respectively.17,21
The heterojunction of g-C3N4/BiOI was prepared using a simple ultrasonication method. Typically, 2.2 mg g-C3N4 and 20 mg BiOI were dispersed in an aqueous solution (30 mL) with 30 min ultrasonication. Afterwards, the dispersion was stirred overnight. Finally, the g-C3N4/BiOI heterojunction powders were obtained by high-speed centrifugation and were then washed with ethanol and water thoroughly. In addition to the above, 10, 5 and 20 wt% of g-C3N4 in the heterojunction were also prepared using same procedure to demonstrate the optimum components.
2.3 Synthesis of Pt/BiOI, Pt/g-C3N4, and Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI nanocomposites
Pt deposited g-C3N4/BiOI heterostructures were synthesized via a simple hydrothermal protocol. g-C3N4/BiOI (40 mg) and 0.6 mL H2PtCl6 (3.8 × 10−2 M) were dispersed into 40 mL of a water/ethanol mixture (1:1) and under ultrasonication with 30 min. Afterwards, the dispersion was added into a Teflon autoclave (volume: 50 mL) and the system was then held at 140 °C for another 4 h. Finally, the samples were obtained by centrifugation and washed with ethanol several times, resulting in a 10 wt% of Pt in the Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI composites. The corresponding Pt/g-C3N4 and Pt/BiOI nanomaterials were obtained in a similar way except that the g-C3N4/BiOI was changed to the g-C3N4 and BiOI nanosheets, respectively.
2.4 Synthesis of working electrode
Firstly, 4 mg of the powder samples and a 20 μL solution of Nafion (Dupond, USA) were added into an ethanol/water mixture (2 mL, Vethanol/Vwater = 1:1). To form a homogeneous dispersion, the samples were placed under ultrasonication for 30 min. Finally, 5 μL of above dispersion was deposited onto the surface of a pre-polished L-type glassy carbon electrode (3 mm diameter) and dried in air in an ambient environment.
2.5 Characterization
The morphologies of the samples were measured via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a JEOL, JSM-6330FT, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL-2100, which were operated at 100 kV. The components of the samples were checked using high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (HAADF-STEM-EDX) (JEM-3000F, 300 kV) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a JEOL JPS-9010 MC spectrometer. The phase structures of the as-prepared samples were carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Bruker D8 Focus, X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation of wavelength λ = 1.5418 Å. A UV-vis-near-infrared (NIR) spectrophotometer (Lambda 950) was used to investigate the absorption of the samples. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was carried out on a Bruker EMX ESR Spectrometer (Billerica, MA) with the following settings: 1 G eld modulation, 100 G scan range, and 10 mW microwave power. DMPO was used to spin trap the hydroxyl radical (˙OH) in the ESR experiments.
3. Results and discussion
The structure of the as-synthesized samples was obtained by employing SEM and TEM techniques. Firstly, the SEM images of g-C3N4/BiOI and Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1A shows typical nanosheets of the composites of g-C3N4 and BiOI. The fine structures of g-C3N4 and BiOI are shown in a larger magnification figure (Fig. 1B), in which the soft sheets of g-C3N4 are coupled with the BiOI nanosheets homogeneously. After Pt was decorated onto the surface of g-C3N4/BiOI, some particles were found on the surface of the nanosheets (Fig. 1c and d).

The fine structures of pure BiOI, g-C3N4, g-C3N4/BiOI, and Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI were further confirmed using TEM images, which are shown in Fig. 2 and S1.† Firstly, the size of the BiOI nanosheet is around 2 μm and g-C3N4 is in the range of 200 nm to 1 μm (Fig. 2a–c). Secondly, the successful hybridization of g-C3N4/BiOI is confirmed in Fig. 2c. Thirdly, from the TEM images of Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI (Fig. 2d and S1A†), Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are easily observed on the sheets of both the g-C3N4 and BiOI. The mean diameter of the Pt NPs is around 3.2 nm. Lastly, as shown in the high resolution TEM (HRTEM, Fig. S1B†) image of Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI, clear lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.23 and 0.28 nm were observed, which correspond to the (111) and (110) planes from the Pt nanoparticle and the BiOI, respectively.21 These results suggest the 2D composites of g-C3N4/BiOI are the ideal support on which to deposit the Pt electrocatalysts.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to clarify the components and the chemical states of the elements in the samples. The XPS spectra for the N, Bi, I and Pt atoms of the samples are shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3a shows that the N 1s spectra has three distinct peaks, which were detected at around 400.1, 401.6, and 402.4 eV. These peaks are considered to be from the sp2 hybridized N involved in the triazine rings (C–NC), tertiary N–C3 groups, and free amino groups (C–N–H), respectively.17,29Fig. 3b and c show the high-resolution spectra of Bi 4f and I 3d, respectively. It is observed that the binding energies of Bi 4f7/2, Bi 4f5/2, I 3d5/2, and I 3d3/2 are centered at 159.4, 164.7, 619.2, and 630.8 eV, respectively.30 Interestingly, compared to bare BiOI and g-C3N4, all of the peaks of N 1s, Bi 4f, and I 3d in Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI have a slight shift (about 0.3–0.5 eV) to higher binding energies. Generally, the shift of the nanocomposite to a larger binding energy is due to the interaction of two or three components.31 From Fig. 3d, the Pt 4f shows two clear peaks at 72.3 and 75.5 eV, which correspond to the metallic Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively,32 which match well with the metal Pt.

In addition, in order to further detect the constituents of the target products, the phase structures of the resulting products were detected using XRD and the results are displayed in Fig. 4a and b. The bare g-C3N4 has one obvious diffraction peak at ca. 27.3° (PDF 87-1523), which can be indexed to the (110) diffraction planes.33 For bare BiOI, partial characteristic signals centering at 29.7, 31.7, 37.4, 39.4, 46.6, 52.3, and 55.3° are consistent with the (102), (110), (103), (004), (200), (121), and (212) planes of BiOI (PDF 10-0445), respectively, suggesting the successful preparation of the BiOI nanosheets.34,35 For g-C3N4/BiOI, in addition to the signals for BiOI, a characteristic diffraction peak of g-C3N4 appeared at 27.5°, indicating the successfully formation of a g-C3N4/BiOI heterojunction. The interaction of g-C3N4 and BiOI contributes to this slight shift. After the Pt NPs were decorated onto the samples, in addition to the peaks of BiOI or g-C3N4 in the XRD curves, at the same time, characteristic peaks of 39.7, 46.2, and 67.5° were also found that are consistent with the (111), (200), and (220) planes of Pt NPs (PDF 04-0802), respectively.21,36 These results show that we have successfully prepared the Pt modified catalyst in all samples. Moreover, the different weight ratios (wt%) of g-C3N4 in the g-C3N4/BiOI nanocomposites are displayed in Fig. 4b. With an increase of the weight ratio of g-C3N4, the peaks of g-C3N4 were increased distinctly. Meanwhile, EDX was used to check the element components in the samples of Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI, all of the elements were detected in the heterostructures via EDX (Fig. 4c), confirming the generation of the Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI heterostructures.

(C) EDX spectrum of the Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI composites. (D) UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of BiOI, g-C3N4, and g-C3N4/BiOI heterostructures. 
The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were carried out to measure the optical absorption properties of samples. Fig. 4d shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of BiOI, g-C3N4, and the g-C3N4/BiOI heterostructure. It can be seen that the absorption edge of the bare g-C3N4 appeared at around 464 nm, indicating its photocatalytic activity in the visible light region.37,38 In addition, BiOI shows an obvious optical absorption in the long wavelength visible light region, with an absorption edge around 671 nm. For the g-C3N4/BiOI heterostructure, the optical absorption combines g-C3N4 with BiOI in the visible light region. Such an obvious absorption in the visible region indicates the potential photocatalytic activity in broad light absorption for the g-C3N4/BiOI heterostructure.
As mentioned in the introduction, the electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol is a key anode reaction in the direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs). We used Pt/g-C3N4, Pt/BiOI, and Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI catalyst modified electrodes as the working electrodes to evaluate the EOR. The experimental process is shown in Scheme 1. Fig. 5a shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves for all of the samples, in which two obvious features were detected with forward (ca. −0.2 V) and backward (ca. −0.25 V) peaks in a 1.0 M CH3CH2OH + 1.0 M KOH solution under visible light illumination conditions. The forward peak is assigned to the direct oxidation of the ethanol molecules absorbed onto the surface of the electrocatalyst and the backward peak is assigned to the removal of the carbonaceous species in the forward scan. The corresponding results are summarized in Table 1. In dark conditions, the three electrodes (Pt/g-C3N4, Pt/BiOI, and Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI) have a similar ethanol catalytic activity, of 35.7, 26.7, and 36.8 mA mgPt−1, respectively. Owing to the beneficial visible light absorption of the samples, the electrodes were irradiated with visible light (>420 nm) to investigate the catalytic performance on the EOR. For Pt/g-C3N4 and Pt/BiOI, the corresponding current densities were enhanced and found to be 123 and 221 mA mgPt−1, respectively. These results indicate that the 2D visible-light-activated support of g-C3N4 and BiOI can improve the catalytic efficiency on the EOR with the assistance of visible light irradiation. The higher improved efficiency observed when using Pt/BiOI is due to better light harvesting in the visible light region.

For the Pt modified composites of g-C3N4/BiOI, the forward peak current density is around 625 mA mgPt−1 under visible light irradiation, which a is 16.9 times enhanced catalytic efficiency compared with that observed in a dark environment. Such a big enhancement is attributed to the heterojunction of the g-C3N4 and BiOI in the composite. The different weight ratios of g-C3N4 in the composites were investigated and are shown in Fig. 5b. Firstly, all of the samples showed evidently enhanced catalytic activities under visible light illumination compared with those in a dark environment. Secondly, the optimum weight ratio of g-C3N4 is 10%. After using an overdose of g-C3N4, the amount of corresponding BiOI decreases, resulting in an inferior light harvesting and lower catalytic activity. We also tested the pH value of the solution before and after the reaction. As a result, the pH value of the solution decreased from 16.10 to 15.84 and 15.99 in visible light and dark conditions, respectively. The slight change of pH is due to the dissolved CO2, which is generated by the catalytic oxidation reaction of ethanol. The greater change of pH further proved that the reaction rate was faster under visible light than without light irradiation. Additionally, the Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI electrode under neutral conditions was studied in 1.0 M CH3CH2OH + 0.5 M Na2SO4. As can be seen from Fig. S2,† the CV curves display the ethanol electro-oxidation features from −1.0 V to 1.0 V in the 1.0 M CH3CH2OH + 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution. For the Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI electrode, the current density of the ethanol oxidation was 9.5 mA mgPt−1 under dark conditions, and was improved to 20.3 mA mgPt−1 under visible light irradiation. This result is similar to that observed for the visible light enhanced electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation in alkaline media. The large decrease in the current density in neutral conditions is due to the change in the electrolyte pH, which has an important role on the adsorption, reaction mechanism and product distribution during the EOR.39
To demonstrate the advantages of broad light harvesting by a combination of g-C3N4 with BiOI, different wavelengths of light (400 ± 15, 450 ± 15, 500 ± 15, 550 ± 15, and 600 ± 15 nm) using band pass filters were used as the light sources. The light intensities were around 3.0 mW cm−2. The mass activities for the EOR of Pt/BiOI and Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI under different wavelength light illuminations are shown in Fig. 6. Firstly, compared to pure BiOI, the heterostructure of g-C3N4/BiOI has a significantly superior catalytic activity for the EOR under light illumination. Secondly, both the as-prepared electrodes still show a photo-enhanced electrocatalytic performance phenomena under long wavelength light irradiation. Under 600 ± 15 nm light irradiation, the mass activity of Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI for EOR reaches 53.1 mA mgPt−1, which is 1.44 times than that observed under dark conditions (36.8 mA mgPt−1). Fig. 6b shows that the mass activities from the wavelength of the monochromatic light illumination were quite well matched with the optical absorption of the g-C3N4/BiOI. These phenomena suggest that our Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI electrode could be applied as solar light-assisted electrocatalysts owing to their broad absorption properties.

(B) The wavelength-dependence of the mass activities on the EOR and optical absorption of g-C3N4/BiOI. 
In addition to the catalytic performance, the catalytic stability is another important factor affecting the commercial application of the DEFCs. Fig. 7 shows the chronoamperometric and chronopotentiometry curves of the samples under visible light illumination and dark conditions. Fig. 7A shows that the current densities of the work electrodes all decline during the initial minute. This is mainly attributed to the unavoidable formation of Pt oxides and intermediate species (viz. CO species) poisoning the surface of the electrode at the early stage of the EOR. Next, the current densities decrease and reach a quasi-stationary value. After 3000 s, the current density of the Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI modified electrodes under visible light was around 18.2 mA mgPt−1, which is about 19.2-fold higher than that without irradiation (0.95 mA mgPt−1). In comparison, the corresponding current density of the Pt/g-C3N4 and Pt/BiOI electrodes under visible light illumination (2.46 and 7.81 mA mgPt−1) was much lower.

Chronopotentiometry is an another way to investigate the anti-poisoning capabilities of the electrodes for the EOR.40 The chronopotentiometric results in Fig. 7b show that the polarization potential of the working electrodes increases at the initial stage, whereas it increases suddenly to a higher potential later on. This phenomenon is caused by the intermediate species CO, which is accumulated on the surface of the electrode, contributing to the decreased catalytic performance at the higher polarization potential. It should be noted that, the Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI showed a significantly longer polarization time (725 s) than that of Pt/g-C3N4 (80.3 s) and Pt/BiOI (134 s) under visible light irradiation and Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI (113 s) under dark conditions. These results reveal that Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI possesses a better poisoning tolerance ability than that of Pt/g-C3N4 and Pt/BiOI for the EOR with visible light illumination.40,41
In addition, Fig. 8a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves recorded in 1.0 M CH3CH2OH + 1.0 M KOH. Firstly, the onset potentials of Pt/g-C3N4, Pt/BiOI and Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI were negatively shifted under visible light conditions compared to a dark environment. In addition, compared with Pt/BiOI and Pt/g-C3N4, the onset potential of Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI was also negative. Thirdly, at the given potential of −0.2 V, the current density of Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI is ca. 831 mA mgPt−1 under visible light illumination. This is ca. 9.9 and 1.9 times higher than those of Pt/g-C3N4 (84.2 mA mgPt−1) and Pt/BiOI (438 mA mgPt−1) with visible light illumination, and ca. 41.1, 8.54, and 14.2 times higher than Pt/g-C3N4 (20.2 mA mgPt−1), Pt/BiOI (97.3 mA mgPt−1) and Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI (58.4 mA mgPt−1) and the electrodes under dark conditions, respectively. The negative shift potential and increased performance of the Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI modified electrode indicates that the introduction of g-C3N4 promotes the kinetics of the charge transfer during the electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol.42,43

The current density with intermittent visible light irradiation in repeated on/off cycles every 30 s was investigated. As shown in Fig. 8b, two distinct phenomena were observed. Firstly, the current density of Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI is always higher than that of the Pt/g-C3N4 and Pt/BiOI electrode. The average current density of Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI is ca. 0.61 mA cm−2, which is 30.5 and 2.90 times higher than those observed for the Pt/g-C3N4 (0.02 mA cm−2) and Pt/BiOI (0.21 mA cm−2) electrodes, respectively. Secondly, with the visible light switching on and off, an obvious decrease and increase of the current density was detected for repeated cycles.
In order to investigate the interfacial charge mobility, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were analyzed by using a Nyquist curve of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz in the same electrolyte under dark and visible light illumination. Generally, the arc radiuses in the EIS spectra reflect the reaction efficiency at the interface. The smaller diameter of the semi-circular arc means that the faster interface charge transfer rate and the separation efficiency of photo-generated electron–hole pairs is higher. As can be seen from Fig. 9a, the diameter of semicircle arcs of Pt/g-C3N4, Pt/BiOI and Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI under light conditions are smaller than those under dark conditions, which suggest an enhanced charger mobility at the surface of Pt/g-C3N4, Pt/BiOI and Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI with visible light illumination. Moreover, the Rct of Pt/g-C3N4, Pt/BiOI, and Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI electrodes was 16340, 9100, and 4693 Ω under dark condition, respectively. When these work electrodes were under visible light illumination, the Rct were decreased to 14450, 8097, and 1597 Ω, respectively, indicating that visible light illumination enhances the separation efficiency of the charges and promotes the charge transfer on the surface of the electrodes. The corresponding equivalent circuits were used to fit the EIS data (Fig. 9b).

Based on above results, the as-synthesized Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI composites show a distinctly improved catalytic performance for the EOR under visible light illumination. The mechanism of the photo-assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol is displayed in Scheme 2. On the one hand, Pt NPs act as electrocatalysts for the traditional ethanol electrocatalytic oxidation. Firstly, the ethanol molecules are absorbed onto the surface of the Pt electrocatalyst, and are then oxidized on the electrocatalyst through oxidation of the ethanol pathway,44,45 which is described in the following eqn (1)–(3): Pt + (C2H5OH)solution → Pt-(C2H5OH)ads(1) Pt-(C2H5OH)ads + 3OH− → Pt-(CH3CO)ads + 3H2O + 3e−(2) 2Pt-CH3CHOads + 12OH− → 2Pt + 2CO2 + 10H2O + 12e−(3)

On the other hand, when Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI is under visible light illumination, both g-C3N4 and BiOI are excited by the generated hole (h+) in the valence band (VB) and electron (e−) in the conduction band (CB) on g-C3N4 and BiOI, respectively. Based on other published reports, the CB and VB for g-C3N4 and BiOI are −1.10 and 1.60 eV, 0.54 and 2.35 eV versus NHE, respectively.24 The photogenerated electrons are transferred with high efficiency from the CB of g-C3N4 to the CB of BiOI, and then together with the electrons from the electrocatalytic oxidation process on the Pt surfaces to the circuit by an external potential, resulting in the improved current density in the CV. At the same time, the holes on the VB of BiOI are migrated to that of g-C3N4. The surface adsorbed OH−/H2O on g-C3N4 will form a hydroxyl radical (˙OH) using these holes. Finally, the ethanol is oxidized by this ˙OH owing to it strong oxidizing ability. Moreover, the adsorbed intermediates on the surface of the catalysts are also oxidized by these ˙OHs. Accordingly, the type II heterojunction of g-C3N4/BiOI results in the decreasing recombination rate of the electron–hole pairs and improves the catalytic activity for the oxidation of ethanol.
Electron spin resonance spectroscopy was used to investigate and demonstrate the above described charger separation pathway and the higher efficiency for the generation of ˙OHs in the samples of g-C3N4/BiOI. Generally, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) is used as a spin trapping adduct to detect the formation of ˙OH in the solution and a four-line spectra with relative intensities of 1:2:2:1 is detected. Fig. 10 clearly shows the four-line peaks with relative intensities of 1:2:2:1 in the ESR spectra of the g-C3N4/BiOI samples after visible light irradiation. These results suggest that the ˙OHs are formed after the g-C3N4/BiOI was excited under visible light irradiation. It should be noted that, the intensities of the peaks in the sample of g-C3N4/BiOI are much higher than these of pure g-C3N4 and BiOI. This result suggests that the holes from the VB of g-C3N4 can be transferred to the VB of BiOI, contributing to the higher efficiency on the generation of ˙OHs in the samples of g-C3N4/BiOI and enhancing the catalytic performance. The above steps are described in eqn (4)–(10). g-C3N4 + hv → g-C3N4 + e− + h+(4) BiOI + hv → BiOI + e− + h+(5) e−CB(g-C3N4) → e−CB(BiOI)(6) h+VB(BiOI) → h+VB(g-C3N4)(7) h+ + OH− → OH˙(8) CH3CH2OH + OH˙ + 5OH− → CO2 + 5H2O + e−(9) Intermediates (COads) + OH˙ → CO2 + H+ + e−(10)

4. Conclusion
In summary, a high efficiency light harvesting g-C3N4/BiOI heterostructure was constructed and worked as a support for the decoration of Pt nanoparticles. The Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI working electrode can be used as an efficient photo-assisted electrocatalyst for electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. Compared to a tradition electrocatalytic reaction (under dark conditions), the Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI displayed an enhanced catalytic activity of 16.9 times under visible light illumination. Furthermore, with the assistance of visible light irradiation, the stability of Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI for the EOR is also improved. Firstly, the type II heterojunction at the interfacial phases contributes to the efficient charge separation in g-C3N4 and BiOI, resulting in the distinctly enhanced photo-assisted electrocatalytic performance. Secondly, the broad absorption of BiOI leads to the broad light harvesting properties of the as-prepared electrode. Even using 600 ± 15 nm red light irradiation, the Pt/g-C3N4/BiOI electrode still has an obviously photo-enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards the EOR. Accordingly, this investigation provides a model for the construction of a high-performance photo-activated support with broad light harvesting capabilities for application in direct ethanol fuel cells.
