    , Accepted 1st October 2018First published on 1st October 2018AbstractNaGdF4 is considered to be one of the efficient hosts for up-conversion (UC) materials; in particular, rare earth-doped hexagonal-phase NaGdF4 exhibits strong upconversion luminescence. However, thin films of NaGdF4 are difficult to prepare by conventional methods due to the presence of fluorine, and hexagonal-phase NaGdF4 cannot be obtained easily at low temperatures. Herein, a thin film of hexagonal-phase NaGdF4:Yb–Er is fabricated by electro-deposition at moderate temperatures. More importantly, the phase of NaGdF4:Yb–Er thin film can be controlled to enhance upconversion luminescence by adding polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in the electrolyte. Upon excitation using a 980 nm diode laser, the UC emission intensity of hexagonal thin films increases significantly compared with that of cubic films. The results pave a new way to control the phase of fluoride crystal films that may find potential applications in photovoltaic devices.
1 Introduction
Lanthanide-doped up-conversion (UC) materials, which can convert near-infrared (NIR) radiation into visible light, have potential applications in various fields such as solar cells, photoelectric degradation, biological imaging and NIR detectors.1–16 The host material plays a vital role in luminous efficiency of UC materials. A series of studies have shown that NaREF4 (RE = rare-earth element) is the optimal host to provide highly efficient UC emissions due to lower lattice phonon energy and high chemical stability.17,18 Moreover, there are two different phase constructions for NaREF4 nanocrystals, namely, the cubic phase (α-phase) and the hexagonal phase (β-phase). It has been generally recognized that RE3+-doped β-phase normally shows stronger emission intensity than the α-phase as the crystal structure of β-phase favours UC emission.19 However, wet-chemistry synthesis of pure crystalline β-phase NaREF4 always requires a high reaction temperature above 200 °C.18,20
It has been reported previously that hexagonal NaGdF4:Yb3+,Er3+ submicron disks can be synthesized at a relatively low temperature in aqueous solution.21 As spectral converters, UC thin films may have applications in solar cells, fluorescent screens and other fields.22–24 However, the film of NaGdF4 is difficult to synthesize by conventional methods, such as chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, magnetron sputtering and spray pyrolysis, due to the presence of fluorine.
Herein, a thin film of hexagonal NaGdF4 doped with Yb3+, Er3+ was synthesized by electro-deposition at moderate temperatures. The key step is that the crystal phase transformed from cubic-phase NaGdF4 (α-NaGdF4) to hexagonal-phase NaGdF4 (β-NaGdF4) by adding different amounts of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) into the electrolyte solution. This process is novel because PVP, which has been used to control morphology in previous studies, can tune the phase of the thin films.25,26 The thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy and optical properties. Upon excitation using a 980 nm diode laser, the UC emission intensity of the β-NaGdF4 thin film increased significantly compared with that of the α-NaGdF4 film. Our result indicates that the β-NaGdF4 thin film may be used in photovoltaic cells and for the detection of NIR light. Moreover, the process will provide a new strategy to control the phase of fluoride crystal films.
2 Experimental section
Gd(NO3)3, Yb(NO3)3 and Er(NO3)3 (all 4 N purity) were dissolved in deionized water to form solutions with the concentration of 0.1 M. These solutions were mixed (the volume ratio of Gd(NO3)3:Yb(NO3)3:Er(NO3)3 is 78:20:2) and then, the same volumes of 0.2 M EDTA-2Na, 1 M sodium ascorbate and 0.8 M NH4F were added into the above solution to form a mixture under constant stirring. The pH of the mixture solution was adjusted to 6 by adding NaOH. Afterwards, different amounts of PVP (0 g, 1 g, 2 g, 3 g, 4 g and 5 g) were dissolved in the mixture solution, which was stirred evenly to form a clear precursor solution for electro-deposition. Scheme 1 shows that the thin film of NaGdF4:Yb–Er was prepared by a conventional three-electrode setup, in which an indium tin oxide-coated glass (sheet resistance: 20 Ω □−1, purchased from Xiang City Technology Ltd), a platinum foil and Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl were employed as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Each sample was deposited for 40 minutes. The bath temperature was kept at 80 °C, and the applied potential was adjusted to 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl). Finally, the products were cleaned and dried in air at 60 °C for 2 h.

The crystal structures of all the thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a RIGAKU D/MAX 2550/PC system operated at a step size of 0.02° at a scanning speed of 5° min−1 using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The surface morphology of the samples was observed using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope and the nanoparticles removed from the thin film and surface morphology were observed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F) coupled with an energy-dispersive spectroscope (EDS). The UC luminescence was recorded using an FLS920 fluorescence spectrophotometer, which was purchased from Edinburgh Instrument Ltd., U. K.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of NaGdF4:Yb–Er thin films

Fig. 1(a) shows that the peaks in the XRD pattern of the NaGdF4:Yb–Er film without PVP can be well-indexed to the cubic phase of NaGdF4 (JCPDS card No. 27-0697, space group: Fmm, a = 0.5518 nm), and no other peaks from impurities can be identified except that for the substrate ITO (JCPDS card No. 89-4597). The SEM images of the thin films synthesized using different amounts of PVP are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2(a) (surface SEM image), the thin film of α-NaGdF4:Yb–Er without PVP consists of relatively homogeneous spherical particles. From the cross-section image given in Fig. 2(b), the thickness of this film is about 1.5 μm. The XRD pattern of the NaGdF4:Yb–Er thin film doped with PVP (2 g) is shown in Fig. 1(b). Some new diffraction peaks can be detected, and they can be indexed to the standard XRD pattern of hexagonal NaGdF4 (JCPDS 27-0699, space group: P63/m, a = 0.602 nm, c = 0.361 nm), suggesting that the crystallographic phase of the film is a mixture of α-NaGdF4 and β-NaGdF4. The average crystal sizes estimated according to the Scherrer formula are 7 nm and 18 nm for samples shown in Fig. 1(a) and (c), respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 2(c) and (d) that the as-prepared thin film is composed of nanospheres and nanorods, implying the presence of two phases in the film. When the amount of PVP is 5 g, as shown in Fig. 1(c), the diffraction peaks of α-NaGdF4 cannot be detected, and the film consists of pure β-NaGdF4:Yb–Er. Fig. 2(e) and (f) show that the surface of the β-NaGdF4:Yb–Er thin film is completely covered with nanorods, and the thickness of the film is about 1.5 μm. As the amount of PVP in the deposition solution increases, the phase of the NaGdF4:Yb–Er thin film changes from cubic to hexagonal; therefore, PVP plays a critical role in adjusting the phase of the crystals.

3.2 The possible phase transition process
During the electrochemical deposition process, the formation of NaGdF4:Yb–Er films involves the following reactions: M3+ + EDTA → M3+ − EDTA(1) C6H7O6− → C6H7O6 + H+ + e(2) M3+ − EDTA + xH+ → HxEDTAx−3 + M3+(3) M3+ + Na3+ + 4F− → NaMF4↓(4)
In the equations, M3+ represents the lanthanide ion (Gd3+, Yb3+, or Er3+), and C6H7O6− is sodium ascorbate. The M3+-EDTA complex is readily formed and is stable in electrolyte solutions at high pH values (pH > 5).27–29 Under a positive applied voltage, ascorbate anion is oxidized to release H+ at the surface of the working electrode, and the pH of the solution is reduced. Afterwards, the M3+-EDTA complex is dissociated around the electrode, and this results in the formation of free lanthanide ions. When electrolyte solution is prepared without PVP, as can be seen from Fig. 3(a), α-NaGdF4:Yb–Er particles are deposited onto the ITO substrate during the reaction of M3+ and Na+ with F− ions near the electrode surface. However, when PVP (2 g) is dissolved in the solution, the growth pattern of the crystals is completely changed. In PVP molecules, nitrogen atoms of amide groups partially donate their lone-pair electrons to the neighboring carbon atoms in the carbonyl groups through orbit conjugation, resulting in positively charged amine groups and negatively charged carbonyl groups. The interactions between the carbonyl groups and the metal ions along with those among polymer molecules via oppositely charged groups ensure the formation of cross-linked chelates.26 One can speculate that Gd3+ and Na+ interact with the negatively charged carbonyl groups of PVP molecules and form cross-linked chelates, which can lead to relatively high amounts of free fluorine ions in the solution. By increasing the ratio of NH4F/RE (3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12), i.e., by increasing the amount of fluorine ions, the crystalline phase is transformed from orthorhombic-phase KSc2F7 to cubic-phase K2NaScF6.30Fig. 3(b) shows that some β-NaGdF4:Yb–Er particles are deposited onto the ITO substrate, which can be due to the relatively high amount of fluoride ions. When the amount of PVP reaches 0.5 g, as shown in Fig. 3(c), the deposited particles are exclusively β-NaGdF4:Yb–Er, suggesting that the phase of the thin film is transformed from cubic to hexagonal in the presence of high amount of fluoride ions.

The sizes and morphologies of the nanoparticles removed from NaGdF4:Yb–Er thin films were characterized by TEM. Fig. 4a shows that the α-NaGdF4:Yb–Er nanoparticles are spherical, and the average diameter of nanoparticles is about 50 nm. EDS of α-NaGdF4:Yb–Er nanoparticles confirms the co-existence of Na, F, Gd and Yb in the nanoparticles (Fig. S1†). The diffraction rings of selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of α-NaGdF4:Yb–Er can be ascribed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (331), (422), (511) and (440) planes of cubic NaGdF4. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shows that the lattice spacing of 0.28 nm can be assigned to the (200) lattice plane of α-NaGdF4. The nanoparticles detach from β-NaGdF4:Yb–Er films and show cylindrical shapes (Fig. S2† and the Fig. 4d). The clear diffraction rings of SAED pattern can be ascribed to the (100), (110), (111), (201) and (102) planes of hexagonal NaGdF4 (JCPDS 27-0699). In addition, the lattice distance of 0.517 nm, corresponding to the d spacing of the (100) lattice plane of hexagonal NaGdF4 structure, is found from the HRTEM image (Fig. 4e). The co-existence of α- and β-NaGdF4:Yb–Er nanoparticles is confirmed by the TEM and SEAD patterns shown in Fig. S3 and S4.† It can be seen that the sphere-like α-NaGdF4 nanoparticles cover the surface of cylindrical β-NaGdF4 nanorods. In addition, we can easily determine the lattice spacing of 0.26 nm, which is ascribed to the (200) lattice plane of α-NaGdF4; also, the lattice spacing of 0.517 nm can be ascribed to the (100) lattice plane of α-NaGdF4 (Fig. S3†). Furthermore, all diffraction rings of the SAED pattern can be ascribed to the planes of hexagonal NaGdF4 and cubic NaGdF4 (Fig. S4†).

3.3 Up-conversion photoluminescence properties

Fig. 5 shows the UC luminescence spectra of NaGdF4:Yb–Er thin films doped with different amounts of PVP. When irradiated using a 980 nm diode laser, green and red emissions can be observed from Yb–Er co-doped NaGdF4 films. Yb–Er ion pair has been widely employed for UC emissions, where Yb3+ ion serves as the sensitizer for 980 nm light owing to its large absorption cross-section at 980 nm. The emissions of thin films both with and without PVP exhibit a similar trend, which suggests the same UC pathways for them. The inset of Fig. 6(a) shows that with efficient energy transfer from Yb to Er, visible emissions around 546 nm and 672 nm are generated from the transitions of Er ion by 4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the UC emission intensity of β-NaGdF4:Yb–Er thin film increases dramatically compared with that of the cubic film. However, the luminescence intensity of mixed phase film is the lowest, which can be due to poor crystallinity of the samples.

(c) Power dependence of the UC intensity of the α + β-NaGdF4:Yb–Er thin film. (d) Power dependence of the UC intensity of the β-NaGdF4:Yb–Er thin film. 
It is essential to explore the dependence of UC intensity (I) on the pump power (P) for identification of the UC mechanism. For any UC process, the relationship between the intensity and the pump power can be described by the following equation: I ∞ Pn(5)
Here, n is the number of pumping photons responsible for exciting ions from the ground state to the emission state, which can be determined from the slope of the photoluminescence (PL) versus the laser excitation power. As shown in Fig. 6(b)–(d), the slopes (n values) obtained are 1.74, 1.58 and 1.61 for the 546 nm emissions; for the 672 nm emission, the slopes are 1.45, 1.39 and 1.53 for films synthesized using 0, 2 and 5 g PVP, respectively. These results indicate that the green and red emissions are two-photon processes in thin films with different phases. Upon excitation at 980 nm, Er3+ ion is promoted from the ground state (4I15/2) to the 4I11/2 state via efficient energy transfer from Yb3+. Subsequently, the Er3+ ion arrives at the 4F7/2 state by a second energy transition and then, it relaxes nonradiatively to the lower state of 4S3/2. Finally, the Er3+ ion relaxes to the ground state by exhibiting green UC emission at around 546 nm. However, the Er3+ ion in the 4I11/2 state can also relax nonradiatively to the lower state of 4I13/2 and then populate the 4S3/2 state by a second energy transition from the Yb3+ ion. Afterwards, it relaxes nonradiatively to the 4F9/2 state. Finally, the Er3+ ion returns to the ground state by exhibiting red UC emission at around 672 nm.
4 Conclusions
In conclusion, a thin film of β-NaGdF4:Yb–Er was synthesized by electro-deposition in a phase-controlled fashion. By adding PVP to the electrolyte solution, the crystalline phase of the thin film was adjusted from cubic to hexagonal, and it was accompanied with a steady change in particle morphology. In addition, visible green and red UC emissions in the NaGdF4:Yb–Er film were significantly enhanced by introducing 5 g PVP. The excellent luminescent property of the β-NaGdF4:Yb–Er thin film makes it a good candidate for applications in photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, the reported method offers a new way to control the crystalline phase of fluoride films.
