    , Accepted 9th June 2018First published on 11th June 2018AbstractInnovative design of electrode materials is crucial for efficient conversion of solar energy into chemical fuel through photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, we report the development of a p–n heterojunction nanowire (NW) based photoanode made of low cost earth-abundant materials. Densely-packed and freestanding individual p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs are fabricated through consecutive electrodeposition of Fe and Ni NWs inside the pores of the anodic alumina template followed by controlled oxidation. Heterojunction formation in individual NWs is confirmed through energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), along with elemental mapping on individual NWs through electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). An inverted ‘V’ shape nature of the Mott–Schottky curve suggests p–n diode like characteristics of the heterojunction NWs. These p–n heterojunction NWs demonstrate a significantly enhanced photocurrent density (∼24 times at a potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE) and a cathodic shift (∼0.4 V) of the photocurrent onset potential compared to the pristine Fe2O3 NW electrode, which can be attributed to the synergistic combination of n-Fe2O3 with the co-catalyst p-NiO facilitating the generation and transfer of photogenerated holes into the electrolyte for water oxidation. This study validates the feasibility of developing Fe2O3 based heterojunction photoelectrodes for efficient PEC water splitting.
1. Introduction
Anthropogenic use of fossil fuels has raised global concern about excessive environment pollution and there is an urgent need for developing technologies to generate green and renewable energy with zero carbon footprint.1,2 Since its invention in 1972, photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting has become a promising technique for elegant capture and storage of solar energy in the form of chemical bonds to generate solar fuel, i.e. hydrogen (H2), the next-generation energy carrier.3–5 Accordingly, various metal oxides like TiO2,3,6 GaN,7 WO3,8 ZnO,9,10etc. have been widely investigated in the search for an ideal photoelectrode for water splitting, with certain crucial characteristics like low cost, high stability, suitable band gap and band edge positions relative to the reduction and oxidation potentials of water.4,11
In such a scenario, hematite (α-Fe2O3) has attracted significant attention as a potential candidate for photoanodes owing to its suitable optical band gap of 2.0–2.2 eV, astounding chemical stability in aqueous medium and extremely low cost because of its natural abundance.11–13 However, the efficiency of α-Fe2O3 photoanodes is still very poor owing to its sluggish rate kinetics of water oxidation, poor absorptivity, the short excited-state lifetime of photo-generated carriers (∼10−12 s) and a very short hole diffusion length (LD ∼ 2–4 nm) that restricts holes created in regions far from the electrode–electrolyte interface from water oxidation.11,12,14 Tremendous efforts have been expended to improve the performance by developing hematite nanostructures and modifying their electronic structures via doping, though the latter also results in thinning of the space-charge layer facilitating recombination.11,12,15,16 Accordingly, improvisation in nanostructured electrode designing is indeed an elegant method to enhance the relative volume of the space-charge region compared to that of the bulk without sacrificing sufficient surface area for light absorption and to tailor the carrier diffusion length for efficient accumulation of photogenerated carriers before recombination.13,16
Additionally, surface modification of hematite nanostructures with active water catalysts together with the design of nano-heterojunctions could also lower the threshold potential and enhance the photocurrent by subduing recombination due to the inherent electric fields generated at the heterojunction interface.16–18 Different heterojunctions based on Fe2O3 nanostructures have already been investigated, where the criteria for improved photocatalytic activity are found to be the additional charge separation by the space-charge layer at the heterojunction interface in addition to that at the nanostructured electrode/electrolyte interface.12,14,19 In this regard, 1D nanostructures like nanorods (NRs) or nanowires (NWs) are practically promising as photocatalysts because of their large aspect ratio providing a huge surface area as electrode/electrolyte interface, shortened diffusion length and directional charge transport suppressing scattering losses.6,20–22
In light of the foregoing reports, here we present a unique PEC catalyst comprising n-type α-Fe2O3 based individual p–n junction NWs with NiO as the p-type counterpart, for enhancing the PEC performance of α-Fe2O3 NWs. NiO is a well-known p-type semiconductor with an optical band gap >3.5 eV and a potential candidate for hole transport layers.19,23 Such individual p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs are especially interesting and intriguing as a PEC catalyst because of several aspects like (1) well-aligned and densely packed heterojunction NWs would provide an ameliorated electrode/electrolyte interface for water oxidation through a space-charge layer; (2) the band gaps of constituent materials are as such for sufficient harvesting of sunlight within a wide wavelength range; (3) the existence of the active water catalyst NiO would promote photogenerated hole injection into the electrolyte to facilitate water oxidation;24 and (4) the formation of a p–n junction in individual NWs, which would promote additional charge separation upon solar irradiation very close to the heterojunction/electrolyte interface, thus helping in water oxidation too. Accordingly, the designed p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 heterojunction NW electrode exhibits significantly improved PEC performance in terms of photocurrent density and photocurrent onset potential compared to pristine n-Fe2O3 NWs, which can be attributed to the innovative electrode design facilitating electron–hole pair generation and separation under solar illumination reducing recombination losses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on designing such individual p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs as a PEC water catalyst.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Synthesis of p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 heterojunction NW electrode
Densely packed and highly ordered freestanding p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs are synthesized by successive electrodeposition of Fe and Ni into the pores of the anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) template followed by controlled oxidation as described below.
At first, nanoporous AAO templates are fabricated by controlled two-stage electrochemical anodization of high-purity aluminium foil in oxalic acid solution as reported elsewhere.25 Then, one side of these AAO templates is coated with a conductive gold (Au) layer through the thermal evaporation technique, before being used as a substrate/working electrode for deposition of metallic NWs in a software controlled three electrode electrodeposition unit (CHI 660E). A high-purity Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode are used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively, during deposition.
Electrodeposition of Fe and Ni NWs within the AAO template is performed following procedures reported previously.26,27 First, arrays of Fe NWs are grown in the pores of AAO using an aqueous solution of 120 g L−1 FeSO4·7H2O and 45 g L−1 H3BO3 as the electrolyte at room temperature. Here, boric acid is used as buffer to control the electrodeposition process and the pH of the electrolyte is maintained at 3.6. The deposition of the Fe NWs is carried out for 1000 s with a dc voltage of −1.04 V, following linear sweep voltammetry results. The template is then removed from the solution, washed carefully and again dipped into an aqueous solution containing 50 g L−1 NiSO4·6H2O and 30 g L−1 H3BO3 for depositing Ni NWs. Ni deposition is performed for another 1000 s under a dc bias of −0.78 V.
After the deposition of metallic NWs, the AAO template is removed carefully by dissolving it into 2 M NaOH aqueous solution to obtain Ni–Fe hybrid NWs freely standing on the Au substrate. Finally, the open arrays of NWs are oxidized by annealing at 450 °C for 2.5 h in air to form NiO/Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs.
2.2. Structural characterization of hybrid NWs
The crystal structures of the as prepared NiO/Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs are analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, a PANalytical X'Pert Pro diffractometer). The morphology and crystallinity of the oxide NWs are studied using field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI Quanta-200 Mark-2), transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI TECNAI G2 TF20ST), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and scanning TEM (STEM). Moreover, the elemental composition and chemical states of different ionic species of hybrid NWs are further investigated by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS ULTRA) techniques, along with their light harvesting property examined using UV-visible spectroscopy.
2.3. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurement techniques
Photo-electrochemical properties of the pristine and hybrid NWs are investigated through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometric (J–t) methods in a three-electrode electrochemical cell consisting of the as-prepared sample as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode and 1 M NaOH solution (pH ∼ 13.6) as the electrolyte, at room temperature. However, the solution is bubbled with N2 for an hour before PEC measurements.
The working electrodes are fabricated by making an electrical contact with the substrate (Au) side (back side) of the sample using silver paste followed by proper encapsulation of the contact as well as the sides of the electrode with an insulating adhesive, keeping only a certain area on the front side (sample side) exposed for electrochemical reactions. The electrochemical data are acquired with an Autolab PGSTAT 302N instrument. A 300 W xenon lamp with an AM 1.5G filter is used to illuminate the working electrodes from the front side. The scan rate for LSV scans is set at 10 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is carried out to support the PEC performance of the electrodes within the frequency range of 10 mHz to 0.1 MHz with an AC field amplitude of 5 mV. The Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots are obtained by performing impedance spectroscopy at a particular AC frequency of 10 kHz and then capacitances are calculated using equation C = 1/(2πZimf), where Zim is the imaginary part of the impedance at frequency f.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphological and crystallographic characterization of NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs
The strategy for the fabrication of vertically aligned and free-standing NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction NW arrays is illustrated in Fig. 1. The process involves deposition of Fe NWs followed by Ni NWs into numerous pores of the AAO template, forming Ni/Fe heterojunction NWs. Arrays of NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs are then formed by controlled oxidation of Ni/Fe heterojunction NWs. This facile method produces densely packed, well aligned and freely standing heterojunction NWs on a large scale on the Au substrate, as observed through FESEM and depicted in Fig. 2a and b.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the fabrication technique of NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction NW arrays. 
 Fig. 2  (a) FESEM image of the NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction NW arrays fabricated on a large scale, (b) and (c) show a close view of the NWs demonstrating their uniform length and diameter along with their free-standing nature, (e) shows the EDS line mapping for the elements Fe and Ni along the length of a bunch of NWs shown in (d) to demonstrate the heterojunction characteristics of the NWs. 
The length and diameter of these NWs are uniform, as can be observed from Fig. 2b and c and found to be within 10–15 μm and 200–250 nm, respectively. The surface of the hybrid oxide NWs is rough which is due to the layer by layer oxidation process of the metallic heterojunction NWs and can also be observed for pristine α-Fe2O3 and NiO NW arrays (Fig. S1†).27,28 The XRD spectrum (as shown in Fig. S2†) for the hybrid NW arrays consists of peaks that can be unambiguously indexed with the respective diffraction peaks of cubic NiO (JCPDS #04-0835) and rhombohedral α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS #89-0597), without any impurity peaks related to any other oxides or hydroxides of either iron or nickel.29,30 However, some additional peaks corresponding to the metallic Au substrate can be identified. For complete analysis of the composition of the hybrid NWs together with the formation of the NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction within individual NWs, the EDS technique is used extensively. The EDS spectrum (Fig. S3†) obtained from the NW sample placed vertically indicates the presence of Fe, Ni and O peaks coming from the heterojunction NWs along with Au present underneath as the substrate. Moreover, the Al peak in the EDS pattern further suggests the presence of a bit of undissolved AAO, which in fact forms a thin insulating layer over the exposed Au substrate in between the NWs, thus making it ineffective during photoelectrochemical reactions. The EDS line mapping curve, as shown in Fig. 2e, is recorded on a bunch of NWs placed horizontally and along the length of the NWs directed by the yellow coloured arrow in Fig. 2d. The line mapping depicts that the lower region of the NWs (almost half of the length of the NWs) is composed of Fe while the upper region (remaining length of the NWs) is composed of mainly Ni with complete absence of Fe, thus suggesting the formation of a heterojunction along the length of the NWs. The line mapping also suggests a sharp and well-defined interface between NiO and α-Fe2O3, with negligible inter-diffusion of the elements across the interface.
To have a better representation of the formation of NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction NW arrays, we have performed EDS elemental mapping of different constituent elements present in the vertically aligned NWs shown in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3b presents the composite image formed after mapping individual constituent elements like Fe, Ni and O and depicted in Fig. 3c, d and e, respectively, within the area marked by the yellow square box in Fig. 3a. These images certainly give a nod to the fact that Fe (marked in red) is uniformly distributed along the lower half of the NWs whereas the remaining upper half is composed of Ni (marked in green), along with the O (marked in blue) distributed throughout the overall length of the NWs, thus confirming the formation of the NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction along the length of the NW arrays.
 Fig. 3  (a) FESEM image of a bunch of NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs, and (b) depicts the composite colour image obtained after mapping different constituent elements present, viz. Fe (c), Ni (d) and O (e). 
Now, to illustrate the formation of individual NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs, TEM analyses are performed and the corresponding TEM image of a single heterojunction NW is demonstrated in Fig. 4a. Distinctly visible contrast between two regions of the NW suggests the presence of two different elemental regimes. The TEM image further confirms the roughness of the NW surface as also observed in the FESEM images, together with the NW diameter as ∼230 nm. Moreover, HRTEM images are also collected from two different regions of the NW to understand their crystalline nature. Fig. 4b depicts the HRTEM image collected from the top region of the NW (shown in Fig. 4a), where clearly visible lattice fringes with an average separation of ∼0.21 nm correspond to the (200) crystalline planes of NiO.26,29 Additionally, the HRTEM image obtained from the bottom side of the NW and shown in Fig. 4c consists of well-resolved lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.25 nm that matches well with the d-spacing of the (110) lattice planes of α-Fe2O3.20,29Fig. 4d shows a typical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image of the heterojunction NW shown in Fig. 4a, where the contrast difference between two regions of the NW can be properly visible. However, the EDS line scanning (indicated by the line in Fig. 4d) along the length of the single NW suggests that the upper region consists of only Ni (Fig. 4e), whereas the lower portion of the NW is completely made up of Fe (Fig. 4f), further confirming the formation of individual heterojunction NWs. Finally, the elemental mapping images obtained by electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS) for the single NW suggest uniform distribution of Ni and Fe towards the upper and lower half of the NW, respectively, from the interfacial junction, along with the uniform distribution of O over the entire length of the NW. Therefore, this novel nanostructure shown in Fig. 4a can be identified as a single NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction NW.

To further characterize the chemical oxidation states of individual ionic species present in the as-synthesized NWs, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy technique is utilized as a sensitive local structure probe and the corresponding survey spectrum for the NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction NW is depicted in Fig. 5a. The full survey spectrum consists of the characteristic peaks for Fe 2p, Fe 3p, Ni 2p, Ni 3p, O 1s and C 1s states. Fig. 5b shows the core level XPS spectra of Fe 2p obtained from the NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs as well as the same obtained from pristine Fe2O3 NWs. For both the samples, the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks are centred around binding energies 711.2 eV and 724.6 eV, respectively, which are typical binding energy values for Fe3+ in Fe2O3.27,28 The distinct satellite peak around the binding energy of 719.1 eV in both the spectra further confirms the trivalent oxidation state of Fe in iron oxide NWs.14,28,31 More importantly, there is no signature of Fe2+ in the NWs which would otherwise give rise to a satellite peak around 716 eV, suggesting the phase purity of the iron oxide samples.31 Similarly, as depicted in Fig. 5c, the Ni 2p core level spectra obtained from both NiO and NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction NW samples show the existence of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 peaks around binding energies of 855 eV and 872.6 eV, respectively, with a spin–orbit splitting of 17.6 eV, suggesting the +2 oxidation state of Ni in nickel oxide samples.26,32 Furthermore, the charge transfer satellite peak occurring around the binding energy of 861.2 eV indicates the divalent oxidation state of Ni.33 However, the O 1s core level XPS spectra (Fig. S4†) for all the samples show two distinct peaks around binding energies of 529.6 and 531.5 eV, which can be assigned to the structural oxygen present in oxide samples and the oxygen in the OH groups or oxygen vacancy defects incorporated at the surface of the NWs, respectively.26,30

However, before understanding the photo-electrochemical properties of pristine and heterojunction NWs, their light harvesting efficacy is measured in the UV-visible region of the solar spectrum and the corresponding absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 5d. Both pristine and heterojunction NWs show an almost similar trend of light absorption, though the heterojunction electrode shows slightly higher absorption compared to the pristine Fe2O3 electrode. The pristine Fe2O3 NWs show an absorption band in the 250–400 nm region which mainly results from the ligand to metal charge-transfer transitions (direct transitions) along with the contributions from Fe3+ ligand field transitions.34,35 Moreover, among different inter-band transitions of Fe2O3, the pair excitation process (6A1(6S) + 6A1(6S) → 4T1(4G) + 4T1(4G)) gives rise to a broad band around 535 nm (∼2.3 eV) and can also be observed for the NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction electrode.34 However, the absorption tail extended from 700–850 nm, observed for both pristine Fe2O3 and NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction samples, corresponds to different ligand field transitions.35
3.2. Photoelectrochemical investigation of pristine and heterojunction NWs
Now, to realize the field of application of the synthesized p–n heterojunction NWs, we have investigated the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of the NW electrodes. PEC measurements are performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell with the pristine and heterojunction NWs as working electrodes, a Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, in 1 M NaOH (pH ∼ 13.6) electrolyte. The p–n junction like behaviour of heterojunction NWs is characterized through Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis by performing impedance spectroscopy at a particular AC frequency of 10 kHz in the dark and under simulated solar irradiation. The M–S plot for the pristine α-Fe2O3 NW electrode (as shown in Fig. S5†) exhibits a positive slope both in the dark and under solar irradiation, suggesting the n-type nature of the electrode.13,14,31 The charge carrier density (ND) of the electrodes is calculated using the equation given as,6,8,13,31ND = (2/eεε0)[d(1/C2)/d(V)]−1,where C is the capacitance of the space-charge region, ε is the dielectric constant of the material and ε0 is the free space permittivity. The pristine α-Fe2O3 NW electrode exhibits donor densities of 5.69 × 1020 cm−3 in the dark and 1.13 × 1021 cm−3 under solar irradiation, which are in good agreement with the values reported for other hematite nanostructures.19,36,37 A small enhancement in donor density under solar irradiation suggests the dominance of the surface recombination effects of electrons and holes that usually affect the photocurrent density of Fe2O3 based photoanodes. However, when this n-type α-Fe2O3 is coupled with the well-known p-type semiconductor NiO, the as-fabricated NiO/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs show p–n junction like characteristics with an inverted ‘V’ shape in the M–S plot both in the dark and under solar irradiation, as shown in Fig. 6a,17,19 where the region of negative slope appears due to the p-type nature of NiO.23 The donor densities for the p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 heterojunction electrode are calculated to be 6.02 × 1022 cm−3 and 9.44 × 1022 cm−3 in the dark and under solar irradiation, respectively. Such an increased donor density of the p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 NW heterojunction electrode can be attributed to originate from the broad NiO/electrolyte interface creating additional electron–hole pairs to take part in water splitting reactions.
 Fig. 6  (a) Mott–Schottky plots for the p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 heterojunction NW arrays in the dark and under simulated sunlight obtained at an AC field frequency of 10 kHz, (b) current density vs. potential curves of pristine Fe2O3 and heterojunction NW arrays in the dark and under light irradiation, (c) Nyquist plots comparing Rct of the electrode materials in the dark and under light irradiation, (d) shows the photoconversion efficiency (η) of pristine and heterojunction NW electrodes, (e) chronoamperometric curves under intermittent solar irradiation for the Fe2O3 and heterojunction NW arrays recorded at a potential of 1.2 V vs. RHE, and (f) shows the normalized plots of the photocurrent–time dependence for the Fe2O3 and p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 heterojunction NW arrays. 
Furthermore, the PEC performance of the p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 NW heterojunction electrode is investigated to evaluate the efficacy of heterojunctions over individual oxide semiconductors. Accordingly, the current density–applied potential (J–V) scans for the heterojunction as well as pristine Fe2O3 electrodes are recorded both in the dark and under solar irradiation as depicted in Fig. 6b. Here the potential scale (vs. Ag/AgCl) is converted to the Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE) scale according to the Nernst equation given as:13,38ERHE = E + E0 + 0.05916pH,where ERHE is the potential vs. RHE, E0 = 0.1976 V at 25 °C and E is the measured potential vs. Ag/AgCl. For pristine Fe2O3 NW electrodes the dark and even the photocurrent densities are found to be very small even at a potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE (J = 0.19 mA cm−2 under light), which can be attributed to the high surface recombination probability of photo-generated charge carriers.13,14,39 However, the photocurrent onset potential for the pristine n-Fe2O3 NW electrode is found to be ∼1 V vs. RHE. It is interesting to note that after the incorporation of p-NiO, the p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs exhibit a cathodic shift in onset potential together with a considerable enhancement in current density compared to the pristine n-Fe2O3 NW electrode even under dark conditions, which can be attributed to the high catalytic activity of p-NiO towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The redox feature at 1.36 V vs. RHE could be associated with the conversion of Ni2+ into Ni3+. Moreover, when the p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 NWs are irradiated with light, a huge enhancement in the current density can be observed. For some quantitative understanding, the p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 NW exhibits a current density of 4.48 mA cm−2 at a potential of 1.23 V vs. RHE under illumination conditions, which is around 3 times higher than the current obtained in the dark and almost 25 times higher compared to the photocurrent obtained for the pristine n-Fe2O3 NW electrode. Additionally, from Fig. 6b one can also observe that the onset potential for photocurrent generation for the p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 NW heterojunction electrode is found to be at 0.61 V vs. RHE, which is more cathodic compared to the onset potential for the heterojunction electrode in the dark (∼0.8 V vs. RHE) and also for the pristine n-Fe2O3 NW electrode. In general, the photocurrent onset potential reflects the overall reaction kinetics or catalytic activity of the photoanode, whereas the photocurrent density at higher potentials reflects the rate of delivery of electrons/holes at the electrode/electrolyte interface, i.e. the rate of gas evolution during reactions.10,16,17 Here, the cathodic shift of the photocurrent onset potential indeed suggests the enhancement in the photocatalytic activity of the heterojunction electrode owing to the presence of OER active p-NiO. The presence of the co-catalyst p-NiO would help in reducing the activation energy of reactions together with the facilitation of photogenerated hole transfer into the electrolyte to take part in the OER.24 This statement can be further supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses and the corresponding Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 6c. The high-frequency intercept of the Nyquist plots with the Re Z axis provides a measure of the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the system that includes the resistances of electrode materials and the electrolyte. A higher ESR value for the heterojunction electrode might be due to the formation of the heterojunction combining two materials. However, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) as estimated from the diameter of the semicircle in the mid frequency region of the Nyquist plots is significantly smaller for the heterojunction NW electrode compared to the pristine n-Fe2O3 NW electrode both in the dark and under lighting conditions. This observation unambiguously suggests that the heterojunction electrode provides a favourable environment for easy transfer of charge carriers into the electrolyte, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. Thus, the role of p-NiO in the heterojunction NWs appears to improve the OER kinetics. Additionally, a significant enhancement in photocurrent density after coupling of p-NiO NWs onto n-Fe2O3 NWs to form the heterojunction electrode establishes the fact that p-NiO acts as an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) by suppressing charge recombination at the electrode/electrolyte interface and injecting photogenerated charge carriers into the electrolyte for enhanced OER. Indeed, densely-packed individual p–n heterojunction NWs provide an ameliorated surface area for abundant space-charge-layer formation at the electrode–electrolyte interface compared to the thin-film based heterojunction electrodes, together with allowing sufficient light absorption (regardless of front side or back side illumination conditions) owing to the synergistic combination of p-type NiO and n-type Fe2O3, thereby contributing to enhance the photocurrent density compared to the pristine Fe2O3 NW electrodes. Nonetheless, besides the space charge layers present at both the n-Fe2O3/electrolyte and p-NiO/electrolyte interfaces, an additional space charge layer is also developed across the p–n heterojunction interface during the equilibration of the Fermi levels at each side, resulting in a band bending from p-NiO towards the n-Fe2O3 side as depicted schematically in Fig. S6.† The inherent electric field thus developed across the heterojunction interface would also help in creating additional electron–hole pairs very close to the heterojunction/electrolyte interface upon photoirradiation and thus play role in enhancing the photocurrent density as well.14,17,18,38 To compare the PEC performance of the n-Fe2O3 NW and p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 NW heterojunction electrodes, the photoconversion efficiency or the solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency (STH) is evaluated under the assumption that all of the photogenerated electrons moved from the photoanode to the Pt counter electrode are consumed totally for hydrogen generation. In such a situation, the photoconversion efficiency (η) can be calculated using the following equation:6,38  where Jph (mA cm−2) is the photocurrent density at an applied bias voltage (V) vs. RHE under the simulated sunlight with power Pin (mW cm−2). Fig. 6d displays the plot of the photoconversion efficiency (η) of the electrodes against applied bias voltage measured under a solar power of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). As can be observed from Fig. 6d, the p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 NW heterojunction electrode exhibits a significantly improved photoconversion efficiency compared to the pristine Fe2O3 NW electrode over the whole potential range. The maximum efficiency observed for the p–n heterojunction electrode attains at a value of ∼0.13% which is almost 16 times higher than that calculated for the pristine Fe2O3 NW electrode. It is imperative to mention that although the photoconversion efficiency of the heterojunction electrode is limited by its high dark current density, the reported efficiency is superior to many other heterojunction-based photoelectrodes reported in the literature.20,40–42
To further understand the kinetics of the photogenerated charge carriers, chronoamperometric (J–t) curves are recorded for the Fe2O3 NW and p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 NW heterojunction electrodes under intermittent solar irradiation at a bias voltage of 1.2 V vs. RHE and are shown in Fig. 6e. Both the electrodes exhibit a stable photocurrent response over time, with the p–n heterojunction electrode showing a significantly enhanced photocurrent density in the J–t curves suggesting its superiority over the pristine Fe2O3 NW electrode. Moreover, it is interesting to observe that the nature of rise and decay of photocurrent, i.e. the transient photocurrent response is significantly different for the two electrodes. In the case of the Fe2O3 NW electrode, the current rises instantaneously with the light switched on, attaining a peak value due to the transient photoinduced separation of electron–hole pairs, followed by a steady state current that represents the equilibrium between charge generation and recombination rates.43,44 However, when the light is switched off, the current drops immediately suggesting a fast recombination rate, with a cathodic current spike that can be attributed to the back reaction of conduction electrons with the remaining holes accumulated at the surface.44 The large degree of electron–hole surface recombination results in such a kind of “spike and overshoot” photocurrent response.43,45 In contrast, the p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 NW heterojunction electrode shows a gradual rise of photocurrent towards a peak value and then reaching the steady state with time upon light irradiation followed by slow decay of photocurrent upon switching off the light, suggesting delayed recombination processes for the heterojunction electrode. It has also been observed that the steady state photocurrent remains stable for more than 2 h under continuous illumination at an applied bias of 1.2 V vs. RHE (Fig. S7†), suggesting good stability of the heterojunction electrode materials. For a quantitative determination of the charge carrier recombination behaviour of the electrode materials, a normalized parameter (D) is evaluated from the transient photocurrent curves using the following equation17,44D = (It − Ist)/(Iin − Ist),where It, Iin and Ist are the time-dependent, initial and steady state photocurrents, respectively. The transient time constant (τ) for the electrodes is defined as the time when lnD = −1.17,44Fig. 6f shows the plot of the normalized parameter lnD against t for two electrodes, from where the time constant (τ) for the p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 NW heterojunction electrode is estimated to be 2.23 s which is more than 5 times higher than that obtained for the pristine Fe2O3 NW electrode with τ ∼ 0.43 s. Now, as a long transient decay time represents slow recombination rates, an increased time constant for the p–n heterojunction electrode indicates the suppression of charge recombination processes at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to the presence of p-NiO co-catalyst which helps in promoting surface reaction kinetics by transferring photogenerated charge carriers into the electrolyte successfully, thus reducing surface recombination probability and accelerating the water oxidation rate at the heterojunction electrode surface.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a new class of p–n heterojunction NW based photoanodes for efficient PEC water splitting. The as-fabricated individual p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 heterojunction NW photoanode shows a significantly enhanced photocurrent density under simulated solar irradiation compared to the pristine n-Fe2O3 NW electrode. Moreover, a significant cathodic shift (∼0.4 V) of the onset potential for photocurrent generation is observed for the heterojunction electrode in comparison with the pristine Fe2O3 NW electrode (with the onset potential at ∼1 V), suggesting the improved photocatalytic activity of the former electrode. A prolonged transient decay time for the heterojunction electrode suggests slow recombination processes of photogenerated charge carriers resulting in improved photocatalytic activity and can be attributed to the synergistic combination of n-Fe2O3 NWs with the co-catalyst p-NiO having high OER activity, promoting charge carrier separation and transfer into the electrolyte. The study widens the scope for developing p–n heterojunction photocatalysts using low cost and earth abundant materials. Furthermore, it can be envisioned that due to the intrinsic p–n diode like characteristics and facile synthetic procedures, these p-NiO/n-Fe2O3 heterojunction NWs will also find applications in sensors as well as in electroluminescent devices.
